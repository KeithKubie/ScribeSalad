Good morning,!  Welcome.

00:26:51.648 --> 00:26:53.706
I'm Frank van Diggelen. 
   &gt;&gt; I'm Roy Want.  

00:26:55.537 --> 00:26:57.537
&gt;&gt; I'm Weit Wang.

00:26:59.198 --> 00:26:59.602
We are all engineers from the 
Android team 

00:26:59.603 --> 00:27:02.656
(Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; FRANK VAN DIGGELEN:  Thank

00:27:02.657 --> 00:27:07.329
you.  We are going to show you 
how recent changes in hardware 

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:09.996
and standards make one meter 
location accuracy possible.

00:27:13.055 --> 00:27:15.055
In some cases as soon as this 
year.

00:27:17.631 --> 00:27:19.631
I will give you a short overview
now 

00:27:20.698 --> 00:27:22.698
and Roy will introduce and show 
you a 

00:27:26.434 --> 00:27:28.080
live demo and Wei will explain 
the WiFi APIs and I will return 

00:27:28.081 --> 00:27:30.932
and talk about new GPS 
technology and APIs.

00:27:34.589 --> 00:27:37.043
At the end they will be loading 
up for the next session and we 

00:27:37.044 --> 00:27:40.331
will take questions outside the 
door and we will be able for 

00:27:40.332 --> 00:27:42.795
office hours at 1:30 p.m. today.
It is a great time for location 

00:27:44.821 --> 00:27:46.821
applications because technology,

00:27:52.606 --> 00:27:54.642
hardware, standards and Android 
APIs are evolving 

00:27:54.643 --> 00:27:58.734
simultaneously.  
So eventually this means high 

00:27:58.735 --> 00:28:02.048
accuracy for everybody.  But 
today we want to take you under 

00:28:04.290 --> 00:28:06.290
the hood of location because we 
want to 

00:28:08.381 --> 00:28:10.381
give you the opportunity to get 
a head start on the future.

00:28:13.132 --> 00:28:17.851
We want to highlight the need to
protect and respect the user.  

00:28:17.852 --> 00:28:19.271
The more people use location the
more careful me and you have to 

00:28:19.272 --> 00:28:21.272
be.

00:28:22.943 --> 00:28:25.231
We will highlight where you must
get user permissions and we will

00:28:25.232 --> 00:28:27.232
close with 

00:28:28.691 --> 00:28:31.752
guidelines for making great 
location apps.  If you think you

00:28:31.753 --> 00:28:36.514
have noticed that your phone 
seems to be more accurate when 

00:28:36.515 --> 00:28:39.162
you are inside shopping malls 
and office blocks, standard was 

00:28:39.163 --> 00:28:42.223
a few years ago you are not 
imagining it.  With each release

00:28:42.224 --> 00:28:46.544
of the fused location provider, 
we have had steady improvement 

00:28:46.545 --> 00:28:49.381
of the Android algorithms and 
machine learning for WiFi 

00:28:49.382 --> 00:28:54.302
locations.  Continues to be 
improvement and you will see 

00:28:54.303 --> 00:28:56.303
indoor accuracy of better than 

00:28:58.995 --> 00:29:00.820
ten meters of but rount round 
type time is the technology that

00:29:00.821 --> 00:29:02.821
will take us to the one meter 
level.  What about GPS?

00:29:06.721 --> 00:29:08.546
Well, in terms of GPS accuracy 
in the open sky there has not 

00:29:08.547 --> 00:29:10.579
been much change in the last few
years of if you are out 

00:29:14.652 --> 00:29:15.915
in the open sky your GPS 
accuracy from your phone is five

00:29:15.916 --> 00:29:17.916
meters.

00:29:18.969 --> 00:29:21.637
But raw GNSS measurements from 
the phones you can now improve 

00:29:21.638 --> 00:29:23.638
on this and 

00:29:25.112 --> 00:29:27.112
with changes in satellite and 
receiver 

00:29:29.804 --> 00:29:31.804
hardware improvements can become
dramatic.

00:29:33.908 --> 00:29:35.939
Everyone is familiar with the 
blue dot.  To get the blue dot, 

00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:39.632
you get location you need 
measurements.  Specifically 

00:29:39.633 --> 00:29:42.095
range measurements from WiFi 
access points or from GPS 

00:29:42.700 --> 00:29:46.781
satellites.  Today we will show 
you how one meter measurement 

00:29:46.782 --> 00:29:50.499
accuracy is available in phones.
The key technologies are WiFi 

00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.500
round 

00:29:54.197 --> 00:29:55.827
trip time, GPS dual frequency 
and carry phase measurements and

00:29:55.828 --> 00:29:59.695
we will show you how to use 
accuracy measurements to create 

00:29:59.696 --> 00:30:03.623
accurate location.  If you just 
want to wait a year or two, this

00:30:03.624 --> 00:30:06.307
will all find its way in to the 
world wide ecosystem and the 

00:30:06.308 --> 00:30:09.172
fused location provider.  But we
want to give you a chance for a 

00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:17.963
one to two year lead.  
We want to work with you to 

00:30:17.964 --> 00:30:20.626
accelerate the future.  To take 
it and bring it closer to the 

00:30:21.666 --> 00:30:25.267
present.  So you might wonder 
why do I need better location 

00:30:25.268 --> 00:30:27.268
accuracy anyway?

00:30:28.722 --> 00:30:30.753
Well, let's look at two 
instances where existing apps 

00:30:30.754 --> 00:30:33.668
could use much better location 
accuracy.  For indoor routing or

00:30:33.669 --> 00:30:38.566
navigation of the kind that you 
used to in your cars you need 

00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:41.815
much better accuracy than you 
have outdoors.  You need one 

00:30:41.816 --> 00:30:43.816
meter accuracy because indoor 
features like the distance 

00:30:45.917 --> 00:30:47.917
between cubes or aisles are only
a few meters.

00:30:51.213 --> 00:30:53.033
And even for the most loved 
outdoor application such as 

00:30:53.034 --> 00:30:57.343
directions and especially 
directions in traffic, we could 

00:30:57.344 --> 00:30:58.772
use higher accuracy than we have
now.  For example, when you came

00:30:58.773 --> 00:31:04.104
here this morning in a car you 
probably had the time estimated 

00:31:04.105 --> 00:31:06.355
by the average traffic speed.  
What you really want is the 

00:31:06.356 --> 00:31:09.405
traffic speed in the lane that 
you are in.  So that you could 

00:31:09.406 --> 00:31:14.297
ask how fast would it be if I 
could take the car pool lane.  

00:31:14.298 --> 00:31:16.171
Of course, many other use cases 
and I'll mention a few before we

00:31:16.172 --> 00:31:20.273
finish.  But the important thing
is that we will sure that you 

00:31:20.274 --> 00:31:24.350
will have many more ideas than 
we have.  And that's the beauty 

00:31:24.351 --> 00:31:28.019
of the open Android ecosystem.  
So now here's Roy to tell you 

00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:30.020
about WiFi 

00:31:32.098 --> 00:31:34.572
rount round trip time.  
   (Applause.) 

00:31:35.382 --> 00:31:37.419
&gt;&gt; ROY WANT:  Thanks, Frank.  
I'm very excited to be here 

00:31:37.420 --> 00:31:39.420
today to tell you about a new 
positioning 

00:31:43.192 --> 00:31:45.192
technology in Android P we call 
WiFi round trip time or RTT.

00:31:47.507 --> 00:31:50.147
You will hear me say that 
acronym a lot.  Measuring the 

00:31:50.148 --> 00:31:52.792
time or flight of RF signals.  
It has the potential to estimate

00:31:52.793 --> 00:31:54.793
your 

00:31:55.854 --> 00:31:58.930
indoor position to accuracy of 
one two to meters.  We are going

00:31:58.931 --> 00:32:01.371
to hit the ground running today 
before I tell you about the 

00:32:03.184 --> 00:32:05.184
details of RTT and we are going 
to show 

00:32:06.468 --> 00:32:08.468
you a video of our indoor 
navigation 

00:32:09.956 --> 00:32:11.003
powered by RTT and I want to 
emphasize first of a you will 

00:32:11.004 --> 00:32:15.309
this is not a product but an 
internal prototype to explore 

00:32:15.310 --> 00:32:17.310
the power of technology and how 

00:32:18.363 --> 00:32:20.363
it can also be used to support 
other contextware applications.

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.957
This prototype show cases some 
of the magic that Google can 

00:32:25.958 --> 00:32:29.615
offer to its employees today.  
We are going to roll the video. 

00:32:29.616 --> 00:32:31.616
And what you should keep in mind
this 

00:32:33.103 --> 00:32:35.955
is a bit like car GPS except we 
are working indoors.  So in a 

00:32:35.956 --> 00:32:39.633
moment you see as an application
mapping application and we are 

00:32:39.634 --> 00:32:43.310
searching for a conference room.
We found that conference room.  

00:32:43.311 --> 00:32:47.161
It is plotted the route.  And 
now we are off.  We are 

00:32:47.162 --> 00:32:48.817
following the route and as I 
make progress you can see the 

00:32:48.818 --> 00:32:52.540
route is turning gray.  My 
position for RTT is the big gray

00:32:53.759 --> 00:32:55.847
dot and I am making an error 
here.  So the system is 

00:32:55.848 --> 00:32:57.848
rerouting.  And it is rerouting 
again.

00:33:02.792 --> 00:33:04.606
I get about 20 feet away it 
starts the rerouting process and

00:33:04.607 --> 00:33:08.352
I'm following the route and you 
can see the code are flying by. 

00:33:08.353 --> 00:33:10.353
There I am coming in.

00:33:12.499 --> 00:33:13.920
And I have arrived at my 
destination.  Conference room 

00:33:13.921 --> 00:33:15.921
Papo.

00:33:18.773 --> 00:33:20.295
So that's the power of RTT.  
Thank you.  

00:33:20.296 --> 00:33:22.335
(Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; ROY WANT:  The thing to 

00:33:22.336 --> 00:33:24.336
think 

00:33:26.488 --> 00:33:28.488
about here is that if you didn't
have 

00:33:29.554 --> 00:33:31.585
one to two meter accuracy then 
when that system rerouted it 

00:33:31.586 --> 00:33:33.586
would jump potentially between 
aisles that were 

00:33:36.474 --> 00:33:38.694
surrounding me and would would 
be a terrible user experience.  

00:33:38.695 --> 00:33:42.774
That's why it is so important to
have this kind of accuracy.  So 

00:33:42.775 --> 00:33:44.775
before I get in to the details 
of 

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:48.470
WiFi RTT I want to tell you how 
we 

00:33:49.475 --> 00:33:51.475
calculate indoors now.

00:33:53.468 --> 00:33:55.720
We WiFi received signal strength
indication.  And basically we 

00:33:55.721 --> 00:34:00.691
can calculate distance as a 
function of signal strength.  

00:34:00.692 --> 00:34:03.136
Now the figure that you see on 
the left-hand side here the 

00:34:03.137 --> 00:34:05.137
access point 

00:34:06.200 --> 00:34:07.839
which is in the center has a 
heat map of signal strength.  

00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.316
The green is the strongest.  And
the red is the weakest.

00:34:14.403 --> 00:34:16.254
And I have placed two phones on 
this diagram at the transition 

00:34:16.255 --> 00:34:19.506
between the weak and the strong.
Notice that the phone on the 

00:34:19.507 --> 00:34:21.507
right is 

00:34:22.773 --> 00:34:23.581
further away from the access 
point than the phone on the 

00:34:23.582 --> 00:34:28.271
left.  So say the signal 
strength different distance and 

00:34:28.272 --> 00:34:29.929
it is this variability in 
distance and unfortunately makes

00:34:29.930 --> 00:34:31.930
it very 

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:38.076
hard to get accurate readings 
from RSSI on a regular basis but

00:34:38.077 --> 00:34:41.337
there are lots of algorithms and
tricks that we can pull to 

00:34:41.338 --> 00:34:43.338
improve this but it can be 
improved 

00:34:44.631 --> 00:34:46.631
further and that's where WiFi 
RTT comes in to place.

00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.620
So WiFi RTT, round trip time 
uses time of flight.

00:34:57.944 --> 00:34:59.799
The time it takes to send a WiFi
RF packet from access point to a

00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.258
phone and back again and because
where radio 

00:35:05.726 --> 00:35:08.595
signals travel at the speed as 
visible light, if we multiply 

00:35:08.596 --> 00:35:10.596
the total time of 

00:35:12.680 --> 00:35:13.895
by speed of light and divide by 
2, we get distance and the range

00:35:13.896 --> 00:35:16.594
from the phone to the access 
point.  So that's the basic 

00:35:16.595 --> 00:35:21.582
principle.  
Now if you want to calculate 

00:35:21.583 --> 00:35:24.443
position we have to use a 
process called 

00:35:24.646 --> 00:35:28.959
multilateralation.  But the key 
thing to think about here the 

00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.403
more ranges you have the more 
constraints you have and the 

00:35:30.404 --> 00:35:34.300
more accurate position you can 
achieve and if you can use at 

00:35:34.301 --> 00:35:36.301
least four ranges then we 

00:35:38.588 --> 00:35:39.830
think you can get accuracy of 
one to two meters in most 

00:35:39.831 --> 00:35:41.831
buildings.

00:35:43.098 --> 00:35:45.098
So why am I telling you about 
WiFi RTT today?

00:35:46.807 --> 00:35:48.807
Why not last year or before?

00:35:52.119 --> 00:35:54.119
2018 is the year of WiFi RTT in 
Android.

00:35:55.817 --> 00:35:57.817
Your take-aways is are that we 
are 

00:35:58.941 --> 00:36:00.941
releasing our public API in 
Android P 

00:36:04.027 --> 00:36:06.027
based on the IEEE 8211MC 
protocol and 

00:36:09.753 --> 00:36:12.596
furthermore, we are also 
integrate ing aspects of this 

00:36:12.597 --> 00:36:14.597
protoll kol that people use to 
put location on a map.

00:36:16.913 --> 00:36:18.757
And any time there are RTT 
access points in a vicinity, the

00:36:18.758 --> 00:36:22.412
accuracy of that position will 
be greater.  

00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:28.080
A little bit of history, the 
8211 

00:36:29.551 --> 00:36:31.993
standard was ratified in 2016, 
the end of it and in early 2017 

00:36:31.994 --> 00:36:33.994
the WiFi 

00:36:35.267 --> 00:36:36.690
alliance studied during interop 
between silicon venders and 

00:36:36.691 --> 00:36:41.575
that's when we started doing a 
lot of work to validate how it 

00:36:41.576 --> 00:36:44.244
could be integrated in to 
Android and by the fall of this 

00:36:44.245 --> 00:36:48.742
year, of course, we release the 
ape so that all of you can have 

00:36:48.743 --> 00:36:49.575
access to and build your own 
applications around that 

00:36:49.576 --> 00:36:54.080
technology.  
So now diving in to the 

00:36:54.081 --> 00:36:56.310
principles of how WiFi RTT 
works.

00:37:00.194 --> 00:37:04.262
So the ranging process starts 
with a standard WiFi scan.  The 

00:37:04.263 --> 00:37:06.263
phone discovers the access 
points 

00:37:07.315 --> 00:37:09.574
and based on certain bits which 
is set inside the beacons and 

00:37:09.575 --> 00:37:12.810
the responses we can figure 
which of those access points are

00:37:12.811 --> 00:37:17.549
RTT capable.  And the phone 
chooses one of those to range to

00:37:17.550 --> 00:37:20.640
and it starts by making a 
request to the access point.  

00:37:20.641 --> 00:37:23.305
And as a result of the access 
point will start a ping pong 

00:37:23.306 --> 00:37:27.605
protocol back.  The ping is sent
to the phone.  It is called a 

00:37:27.606 --> 00:37:29.606
fine timing measurement packet.

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:35.740
And the pong is sent back to the
access point is acknowledgement.

00:37:38.486 --> 00:37:40.732
The timestamps are recorded at 
each end but for the phone to 

00:37:40.733 --> 00:37:42.733
calculate the 

00:37:44.027 --> 00:37:46.520
total round trip time it has to 
have all those timestamps.  It 

00:37:46.521 --> 00:37:48.521
sends one more packet which 
contains the missing two.

00:37:51.242 --> 00:37:53.913
The phone then simply calculates
the round trip time by 

00:37:53.914 --> 00:37:58.827
subtracting the timestamps from 
the AP and its own turnaround 

00:37:58.828 --> 00:38:02.190
time which are the timestamps 
that it recorded.  So that 

00:38:02.191 --> 00:38:04.232
leaves the time of flight 
multiply by the speed of lights 

00:38:04.233 --> 00:38:08.099
to get distance and we divide by
2 and we get the range that we 

00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.989
care about.  Now it turns out if
you do this process multiple 

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:16.451
times you will in fact, get more
accuracy.  So that's what the 

00:38:16.452 --> 00:38:18.452
protocol allows for.  It allows 
for birs. 

00:38:22.807 --> 00:38:24.452
&gt;&gt; EVE ANDERSS and Android we 
are doing bursts of eight of 

00:38:24.453 --> 00:38:28.733
these events and the system can 
calculate statistics.  So the 

00:38:28.734 --> 00:38:31.629
mean and the variance which 
allows to more accuracy plot a 

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:36.374
position on a map and knowing 
the accuracy also allows us to 

00:38:36.375 --> 00:38:39.044
calculate a path more accurately
as well.

00:38:43.486 --> 00:38:45.486
So now you have ranges.  How do 
you get a position.

00:38:47.596 --> 00:38:50.851
I want to give your a feel for 
how you go about doing this.  

00:38:50.852 --> 00:38:53.508
There are lots of mathematical 
approaches.  I am picking one 

00:38:53.509 --> 00:38:55.949
because it is easy to explain.  
This is where the power of 

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:00.206
developers come in to figure out
your own way to do it.  If you 

00:39:00.207 --> 00:39:02.500
know a phone is a certain range 
from an access point that tells 

00:39:02.501 --> 00:39:04.501
you it 

00:39:07.007 --> 00:39:10.883
can be anywhere on the 
sircircumference of a circle.  I

00:39:10.884 --> 00:39:12.884
have written the circular 
equation 

00:39:13.965 --> 00:39:16.841
for that circumference on the 
right-hand side.  Now if you 

00:39:16.842 --> 00:39:20.733
want to find a position you have
got to constrain it.  If you 

00:39:20.734 --> 00:39:22.997
take four ranges to four 
separate access points as I have

00:39:22.998 --> 00:39:26.476
shown on the diagram on the 
right-hand side you then can see

00:39:26.477 --> 00:39:29.742
if those ranges were accurate, 
those circles would intersect at

00:39:29.743 --> 00:39:31.743
a signal point.

00:39:34.475 --> 00:39:36.475
How do you find that point 
program mat tickically?

00:39:39.318 --> 00:39:41.318
You see the nasty sir

00:39:43.063 --> 00:39:45.063
circle equations it is very 

00:39:46.124 --> 00:39:47.960
straightforward and you pick one
and sub strak and you end up 

00:39:47.961 --> 00:39:52.053
with a set of Y equations and 
those lines are in fact, drawn 

00:39:52.054 --> 00:39:53.900
on this diagram as well and it 
is very easy to find out where 

00:39:53.901 --> 00:39:58.016
two lines intersect.  One 
problem with what I just told 

00:39:58.017 --> 00:40:01.267
you and the problem is that we 
are assuming the measurements 

00:40:01.268 --> 00:40:03.268
are perfect.

00:40:04.352 --> 00:40:06.584
In reality no measurements are 
perfect.  Everything has error 

00:40:06.585 --> 00:40:12.117
and the there will be no exact 
solution to that equation.  So 

00:40:12.118 --> 00:40:14.575
let me give you a more realistic
example.  Here we have several 

00:40:14.576 --> 00:40:16.576
access points 

00:40:18.886 --> 00:40:20.107
which we have ranged to and I 
have exsaj ger rated the problem

00:40:20.108 --> 00:40:22.963
here and you can see some of 
those circles don't intersect.  

00:40:22.964 --> 00:40:24.615
How do you solve that?  You do 
the same thing as you did 

00:40:24.616 --> 00:40:26.649
before.  You sub strak the 
circles and you get 

00:40:32.148 --> 00:40:34.382
the lines but this time they 
don't intersect in a point and 

00:40:34.383 --> 00:40:36.383
your phone lies probably 
somewhere maximum likelihood in 

00:40:38.731 --> 00:40:40.731
the center of of that triangle 
and then 

00:40:42.397 --> 00:40:45.059
we can apply some college math, 
squared solution and get a 

00:40:45.060 --> 00:40:47.302
maximum likelihood.  You can 
find standard packages that do 

00:40:48.510 --> 00:40:53.290
this on the net.  You can refine
this position further by 

00:40:53.291 --> 00:40:55.110
repeating this process 
particularly as the phone moves 

00:40:55.111 --> 00:40:57.158
and then you can calculate your 
trajectory.

00:41:01.845 --> 00:41:03.845
So that's basic prinic 
principles.

00:41:04.922 --> 00:41:06.922
Like any new technology there 
are challenges.

00:41:08.339 --> 00:41:10.339
We

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:14.110
have experienced some of these 
early on.

00:41:15.413 --> 00:41:17.050
Robot can measure the range and 
validates it against the marks 

00:41:17.051 --> 00:41:20.745
which are on the floor which 
provide us with ground truth.  

00:41:20.746 --> 00:41:22.746
What we find is that sometimes 
is 

00:41:25.212 --> 00:41:27.266
there a constraint range 
calibration offset and sometimes

00:41:27.267 --> 00:41:29.267
also you see multi 

00:41:31.149 --> 00:41:33.149
path effects where the nonsight 
path to 

00:41:34.451 --> 00:41:35.261
the access point to the phone is
actually received rather than 

00:41:35.262 --> 00:41:37.916
the line of sight path.  That 
one can be solved by the vender 

00:41:40.598 --> 00:41:42.598
using something called a 
tentative 

00:41:43.662 --> 00:41:45.285
diversity but all of these 
things are algorithms which the 

00:41:45.286 --> 00:41:48.543
venders are improving and we 
have to go through a teething 

00:41:48.544 --> 00:41:50.544
process of getting rid of these 
bugs.

00:41:52.243 --> 00:41:54.243
And Google can help in this 
process by 

00:41:55.528 --> 00:41:58.213
providing reference platforms 
and applications to the venders 

00:41:58.214 --> 00:42:03.517
can calibrate their platforms.  
Now I have assumed that you want

00:42:03.518 --> 00:42:05.964
to start as an early adopter and
start 

00:42:09.238 --> 00:42:11.872
using this API but as we move in
to the relatively near future we

00:42:11.873 --> 00:42:15.547
expect you to just use the fused
location provider because we are

00:42:15.548 --> 00:42:19.229
going to be putting the RTT 
capability in to it.  At the 

00:42:19.230 --> 00:42:21.230
moment fused location provider 

00:42:22.902 --> 00:42:24.902
uses GPS what is available, cell
signal 

00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:28.781
strength, WiFi RSSI and also 
fuses with 

00:42:30.902 --> 00:42:32.902
the onboard sensors navigation.

00:42:35.258 --> 00:42:37.311
Now we are adding WiFi RTT in to
that mix and it will increase 

00:42:37.312 --> 00:42:41.991
the accuracy whatever RTT access
points are available.  Okay.  So

00:42:41.992 --> 00:42:44.628
the one other thing to remember 
is that when you are doing 

00:42:44.629 --> 00:42:48.530
itself you had to know the 
position of the access points.  

00:42:48.531 --> 00:42:50.766
We have a fused location 
provider we will know those 

00:42:50.767 --> 00:42:53.204
positions automatically for you.
We will crowdsource those 

00:42:53.205 --> 00:42:56.881
positions so you won't have to 
worry about that and that will 

00:42:56.882 --> 00:42:59.117
make life a lot more -- a lot 
easier for you to write 

00:42:59.118 --> 00:43:03.616
applications.  Okay.  So now we 
are going to take it up a notch 

00:43:03.617 --> 00:43:05.617
and we are going to give you a 

00:43:07.103 --> 00:43:08.353
life RTT demo in collaboration 
with some of our colleagues in 

00:43:08.354 --> 00:43:10.354
geo.

00:43:13.809 --> 00:43:17.309
So what I have over here on 
podium is a phone.  Bring it 

00:43:17.310 --> 00:43:20.213
back.  Okay.  There we go.

00:43:24.489 --> 00:43:27.342
Which is running an RTT system 
in combination with Google 

00:43:27.343 --> 00:43:32.018
mobile maps.  And what we are do
something we are using a number 

00:43:32.019 --> 00:43:34.019
of access points which are 
around the room.

00:43:36.909 --> 00:43:39.549
I'm -- you saw the blue boxes 
which are on slides.  You can 

00:43:39.550 --> 00:43:41.550
see them around the room towards
the back on this side and also a

00:43:42.808 --> 00:43:44.808
couple in the center over here.

00:43:47.488 --> 00:43:49.951
Now we will take to bear in 
mind, this phone because we are 

00:43:49.952 --> 00:43:52.013
in a tent would normally receive
GPS signals.

00:43:56.539 --> 00:43:58.539
You are only using RTT with this
phone 

00:44:00.145 --> 00:44:01.792
and what I am going to do I'm 
going to walk around the aisles 

00:44:01.793 --> 00:44:05.898
and I have already got a plot.  
So I'm going to start moving 

00:44:05.899 --> 00:44:10.783
now.  It is not going towards 
the corner of the stage and you 

00:44:10.784 --> 00:44:12.784
should see the blue 

00:44:14.066 --> 00:44:16.066
dot with my man inside following
me.

00:44:17.367 --> 00:44:20.870
And we, of course, we expect 
accuracy of one to two meters.  

00:44:20.871 --> 00:44:22.871
So I am walking on the aisle.

00:44:24.965 --> 00:44:26.965
The aisle here is about two 
meters 

00:44:30.477 --> 00:44:32.477
across thereabouts and it is 
nicely 

00:44:33.953 --> 00:44:36.002
following within that accuracy. 
I think the demo environment has

00:44:36.003 --> 00:44:38.003
been very good to us so far.

00:44:40.881 --> 00:44:42.881
So we are going

00:44:49.339 --> 00:44:51.377
along a little bit of lag, and 
we are approaching the turn 

00:44:51.378 --> 00:44:53.378
around point where 

00:44:55.476 --> 00:44:57.313
I am going to walk up the aisle 
and rerouting as I come back to 

00:44:57.314 --> 00:45:01.014
make my path a little bit 
shorter.  And you can see we are

00:45:01.015 --> 00:45:03.015
going very 

00:45:04.068 --> 00:45:06.068
nicely and still well within the
one to 

00:45:08.597 --> 00:45:10.032
two meters and if you had GPS 
shown here as well and you would

00:45:10.033 --> 00:45:12.033
be expecting to 

00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:15.993
see five meters, but that 
outdoors.  Indoors in a typical 

00:45:15.994 --> 00:45:19.039
building you are only going to 
have indoor location technology 

00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:21.040
such as this.

00:45:22.291 --> 00:45:24.291
I'm approaching the corner of 
the 

00:45:26.408 --> 00:45:28.271
stage and at this point I'll 
hand back over to Wei.  

00:45:28.272 --> 00:45:31.725
(Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; ROY WANT:  Thank you very 

00:45:31.726 --> 00:45:33.726
much.

00:45:40.913 --> 00:45:43.149
Wang Wei is going to tell you 
about the details of the API. 

00:45:43.150 --> 00:45:46.616
   &gt;&gt; WEI WANG:  Hey.  Thanks 
Roy.  What a great demo.

00:45:51.954 --> 00:45:53.954
So now you must be very eager to
try it yourself.

00:45:57.074 --> 00:45:58.900
Let me walk you through the RTT 
see how you can add RTT in your 

00:45:58.901 --> 00:46:00.901
own application.  

00:46:04.395 --> 00:46:06.395
So as Roy mentioned RTT measures
the 

00:46:07.448 --> 00:46:09.448
round trip time between two WiFi
devices.

00:46:11.525 --> 00:46:15.852
So both mobile phone and exit 
points need to support 8.211 

00:46:15.853 --> 00:46:19.510
protocol.  RTT can give you very
fine location down to one meter 

00:46:19.511 --> 00:46:21.511
accuracy.

00:46:22.963 --> 00:46:24.187
So your application needs to 
declare access find location 

00:46:24.188 --> 00:46:28.717
permission.  And, of course, 
both locations and WiFi scan 

00:46:28.718 --> 00:46:32.215
need to be enabled on the mobile
device.  

00:46:32.615 --> 00:46:36.290
Okay.  So how do you know 
whether your mobile phone 

00:46:36.291 --> 00:46:38.291
supports RTT?

00:46:39.591 --> 00:46:42.288
In P we added a new system 
feature called feature WiFi RTT.

00:46:45.150 --> 00:46:47.150
So you can simply check whether 
this 

00:46:48.624 --> 00:46:50.624
is true on a mobile device or 
pixel 

00:46:53.518 --> 00:46:55.393
phones running 2 and above will 
support RTT.  How do you know 

00:46:55.394 --> 00:46:57.394
whether your access points 
support RTT?

00:47:00.174 --> 00:47:02.174
As normal you will need to do a 
WiFi 

00:47:04.904 --> 00:47:06.904
scan and get a list of WiFi scan
routes.

00:47:07.999 --> 00:47:10.039
Least -- WiFi scan routes and 
check whether this method is 

00:47:10.040 --> 00:47:13.109
802.11.  This will tell you 
whether the access 

00:47:16.966 --> 00:47:20.677
points support RTT.  
So after you get a list of RTT 

00:47:20.678 --> 00:47:22.678
enabled 

00:47:26.584 --> 00:47:28.228
ATs simply add them to scan, 
request builder to build a scan 

00:47:28.229 --> 00:47:30.229
request.

00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:33.517
RTT is done by WiFi RTT manager 
which you can get by getting the

00:47:33.518 --> 00:47:35.518
system 

00:47:37.201 --> 00:47:39.201
service WiFi RTT rendering 
service.  Okay.

00:47:41.727 --> 00:47:43.727
Now I am ready to start RTT 
rendering 

00:47:46.882 --> 00:47:48.882
of by sending the RT request to 
the RTT 

00:47:51.170 --> 00:47:53.170
manager, RTT will start.

00:47:56.527 --> 00:47:58.154
RTT takes no more than 100 
milliseconds and when finished 

00:47:58.155 --> 00:48:00.155
you will 

00:48:01.414 --> 00:48:04.294
get a list of information, you 
including the status that RTT 

00:48:04.295 --> 00:48:09.603
might fail.  And also the most 
importantly the distance between

00:48:09.604 --> 00:48:11.604
the mobile phone and the access 
point.

00:48:13.695 --> 00:48:18.155
So here is the list of 
information you can get from 

00:48:18.156 --> 00:48:20.156
RTT.

00:48:21.279 --> 00:48:22.900
You get the distance, also get 
the distance and information 

00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:24.901
which is 

00:48:26.571 --> 00:48:29.217
(inaudible) from renderings in 
multiple FTMs and you can also 

00:48:29.218 --> 00:48:31.218
get number of 

00:48:32.329 --> 00:48:34.329
attempted FTM measurements and 
number of settlement amendments.

00:48:37.694 --> 00:48:40.547
So ratio of measurements will 
give you idea of how good the 

00:48:40.548 --> 00:48:43.828
WiFi environment is for RTT 
rendering.  

00:48:43.829 --> 00:48:45.829
Okay.

00:48:49.127 --> 00:48:50.609
So I mentioned all pixel devices
will support RTT.  How about 

00:48:50.610 --> 00:48:52.610
access points?

00:48:55.288 --> 00:48:57.336
We are begin access points 
supporting MCC protocol in 

00:48:57.337 --> 00:48:59.778
production and are excited to 
let you know Google WiFi will 

00:49:02.632 --> 00:49:03.444
soon support MC11 protocol.  
Yeah.  Thank you.  

00:49:03.445 --> 00:49:05.445
(Applause.

00:49:06.454 --> 00:49:09.184
) 
   &gt;&gt; WEI WANG:  By the end of 

00:49:09.185 --> 00:49:11.185
this year 

00:49:14.507 --> 00:49:16.507
WiFi will have RTT enabled by 
default.

00:49:18.591 --> 00:49:20.591
World wide we are beginning to 
send the deployment.

00:49:23.892 --> 00:49:25.319
Is leading the deployment.  Of 
course, this is just the 

00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:30.012
beginning of the long journey.  
We are eager to send a larger 

00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:37.987
penetration rate of RTT in up  
coming years.  I am going to 

00:49:37.988 --> 00:49:41.037
hand over to Frank to talk about
one meter GPS.  

00:49:41.459 --> 00:49:41.690
&gt;&gt; FRANK VAN DIGGELEN:  Thank 
you.  

00:49:41.691 --> 00:49:45.179
(Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; FRANK VAN DIGGELEN:  Okay.

00:49:48.236 --> 00:49:50.236
So let's move to the great 
outdoors 

00:49:52.060 --> 00:49:54.426
and speak about G PS.  I am 
going to show you just enough to

00:49:56.455 --> 00:49:57.677
explain what's new to the 
satellites and what's new in the

00:49:57.678 --> 00:49:59.718
phones.  And how you can exploit
these changes 

00:50:02.802 --> 00:50:04.802
to get better location accuracy 
from GPS 

00:50:06.310 --> 00:50:08.310
when you are outdoors under open
sky.  

00:50:10.801 --> 00:50:12.801
So GPS works like this, it sends
a code 

00:50:13.896 --> 00:50:15.331
from the satellite and the code 
encodes the time at the 

00:50:15.332 --> 00:50:17.977
satellite.  The net travels to 
you through space 

00:50:21.237 --> 00:50:22.864
and arrives at you and your GPS 
receivable will compare that 

00:50:22.865 --> 00:50:25.497
time with the time in clock.  
Difference between those two 

00:50:25.498 --> 00:50:28.150
tells how far you are away.  It 
is kind of like you have a tape 

00:50:32.988 --> 00:50:35.496
measure where one ends at the 
satellite and you are holding 

00:50:35.497 --> 00:50:38.560
the spool.  At any moment you 
can look down and read a number 

00:50:38.561 --> 00:50:41.814
which is the difference in these
two times.  If you move further 

00:50:41.815 --> 00:50:43.815
away, you read a bigger number.

00:50:45.685 --> 00:50:47.685
You move aa little bit closer 
you read a smaller number.

00:50:50.598 --> 00:50:52.057
But now the actual GPS tape me 
sure is special.  It is really 

00:50:52.058 --> 00:50:54.058
long.

00:50:55.948 --> 00:50:57.948
Secondly the tick marks occur 
only 

00:51:01.903 --> 00:51:03.903
every 300 meters because shes 
these bits 

00:51:05.783 --> 00:51:08.644
of a code occur at a rate of one
microsecond.  So this is like a 

00:51:08.645 --> 00:51:11.097
tape measure where instead of 
having all these inches on 

00:51:16.262 --> 00:51:18.262
here you only have a mark every 
300 

00:51:19.527 --> 00:51:21.527
meters and it brerP Poe lates 
between 

00:51:23.176 --> 00:51:25.176
those marks and there is our 
five meter accuracy.

00:51:27.097 --> 00:51:29.730
Because how does that code get 
through space in the first 

00:51:29.731 --> 00:51:31.974
place.  It is carried on a 
carrier wave.

00:51:35.018 --> 00:51:37.674
Radio wave for GPS has a 
wavelength that is less than 20 

00:51:37.675 --> 00:51:42.200
centimeters.  And your GPS 
receiver can measure where you 

00:51:42.201 --> 00:51:44.854
are on this wave and as long as 
it keeps tracking it, can 

00:51:44.855 --> 00:51:46.855
measure 

00:51:48.627 --> 00:51:50.627
relative motion with great 
precision.  

00:51:51.271 --> 00:51:53.535
And this is because the receiver
will measure the phase and as 

00:51:53.536 --> 00:51:56.831
you move that phase will change.
But now what about getting your 

00:51:57.643 --> 00:51:59.643
absolute location?

00:52:01.098 --> 00:52:03.537
The trouble with the carrier 
phase ruler if you like is that 

00:52:03.538 --> 00:52:05.538
it is -- it is 

00:52:07.437 --> 00:52:10.298
kind of like a ruler with very 
precise markings on it but no 

00:52:10.299 --> 00:52:13.761
numbers at all.  So your 
receiver can tell you the phase 

00:52:13.762 --> 00:52:16.244
of the wave you are on but it 
doesn't know are you the green 

00:52:16.245 --> 00:52:20.556
dot, or the red dot.  So how do 
you solve that problem?  Well, 

00:52:20.557 --> 00:52:22.557
for that you need to introduce a

00:52:24.241 --> 00:52:26.241
new concept, which is GPS 
reference stations.

00:52:28.124 --> 00:52:29.947
So these are GPS receivers at 
fixed sites measuring the same 

00:52:29.948 --> 00:52:31.948
thing at the same time.

00:52:33.844 --> 00:52:35.844
They communicate that data to 
you with 

00:52:37.707 --> 00:52:42.418
well-known algorithms.  You can 
work out where you are relative 

00:52:42.419 --> 00:52:44.419
to the reference station with 

00:52:45.915 --> 00:52:49.377
great precision, with this 
carrier phase precision.  You 

00:52:49.378 --> 00:52:51.209
know where you are with great 
precision.  So this concept is 

00:52:51.210 --> 00:52:54.108
not new.  This is being in 
commercial GPS 

00:52:57.379 --> 00:52:59.612
receivers since the 1980s for 
surveying.  Hence our little 

00:52:59.613 --> 00:53:01.613
surveyor there 

00:53:03.718 --> 00:53:05.536
holding the GPS antenna on the 
stick.  The availability of 

00:53:05.537 --> 00:53:07.787
these carrier phase measurements
from phones.

00:53:11.668 --> 00:53:13.668
And dual frequency measurements 
in phones.

00:53:16.777 --> 00:53:18.777
Right now all of your 
Smartphones all 

00:53:20.240 --> 00:53:21.045
Smartphones everywhere have GPS 
or GNSS on one frequency band 

00:53:21.046 --> 00:53:25.132
only.  It is known as L1.  But 
there is a new frequency in 

00:53:25.133 --> 00:53:29.002
town.  It is called L5 and it is
supported by all these GNSS 

00:53:29.003 --> 00:53:31.003
systems.

00:53:33.490 --> 00:53:35.944
GPS, Galeo and IRNSS and the 
availabilities of a second 

00:53:35.945 --> 00:53:40.425
frequency means that you get 
much faster convergence to 

00:53:40.426 --> 00:53:42.426
carrier phase accuracy if 

00:53:44.325 --> 00:53:46.152
you are did doing this kind of 
procedure.  We went through the 

00:53:46.153 --> 00:53:50.428
ambiguity that you have on a 
single wave.  Now look at what 

00:53:50.429 --> 00:53:52.429
happens if you introduce a 
second wave at a different 

00:53:53.681 --> 00:53:55.681
frequency.

00:53:56.992 --> 00:53:58.407
Immediately you can disam big 
ways because you could not have 

00:53:58.408 --> 00:54:01.672
that same phrase on that second 
wave as on both of those 

00:54:01.673 --> 00:54:03.673
wavelengths.

00:54:04.738 --> 00:54:06.738
You could not be on the red dot 
if you 

00:54:07.805 --> 00:54:09.833
are at the peak of the red wave.
You can get much faster 

00:54:09.834 --> 00:54:12.489
convergence to the very high 
accuracy that you want.  

00:54:12.697 --> 00:54:16.598
All right.  So what about 
hardware?  Well, in the last few

00:54:16.599 --> 00:54:18.599
months several 

00:54:20.871 --> 00:54:23.107
companies that produce consumer 
PS chips have announced the 

00:54:23.108 --> 00:54:25.108
availability of dual 

00:54:27.780 --> 00:54:29.606
frequency L1L5GPS chips both for
the automobile market and phone 

00:54:29.607 --> 00:54:31.843
market and these chips are 
designed in to cars and 

00:54:34.848 --> 00:54:38.806
phones.  Now let's talk about 
the measurements themselves and 

00:54:38.807 --> 00:54:40.807
the APIs.

00:54:42.469 --> 00:54:44.469
The phone must support the GNSS 
measurements API.

00:54:46.719 --> 00:54:48.562
And your app is going to need 
access fine location permission 

00:54:48.563 --> 00:54:50.563
and location needs to be on.

00:54:52.666 --> 00:54:54.700
So this is the basic 
requirements.  So how do you 

00:54:54.701 --> 00:54:58.350
know if a particular phone 
supports these measurements?  At

00:54:58.351 --> 00:55:01.036
a high level you can go to a 
website that we maintain G.

00:55:04.731 --> 00:55:07.188
code part of the Android 
developer site and this is just 

00:55:07.189 --> 00:55:09.189
a table there that 

00:55:10.667 --> 00:55:12.328
lists phones that support the 
GNS's measurements and also 

00:55:12.329 --> 00:55:14.568
which characteristics they 
support.  So it will tell you 

00:55:14.569 --> 00:55:19.241
which phones support the me 
surements and which support the 

00:55:19.242 --> 00:55:20.864
carrier phase measurements.  You
do the this as follows:  You 

00:55:20.865 --> 00:55:23.524
need a method on status changed 
and it will 

00:55:26.826 --> 00:55:29.499
return an integer that tells you
the capability of the phone.  

00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.939
Either if the phone just does 
not support the measurements at 

00:55:31.940 --> 00:55:35.864
all or if they are supported but
location is off, or if they 

00:55:35.865 --> 00:55:37.865
support it and location is on.

00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.520
And the last case you are good 
to go.

00:55:46.865 --> 00:55:48.865
So let's get in to details of 
APIs.

00:55:50.576 --> 00:55:52.576
There is get con stelation type 
which 

00:55:54.852 --> 00:55:56.852
tells you which of different 
GNSS con 

00:56:01.168 --> 00:56:03.168
stelation, get carrier frequency
Hertz.

00:56:04.216 --> 00:56:06.850
And then most importantly there 
is get accumulated Delta range 

00:56:06.851 --> 00:56:08.851
meters which is 

00:56:10.733 --> 00:56:12.351
how far along that wave the 
receiver has tracked you since 

00:56:12.352 --> 00:56:14.352
it began tracking the signal.

00:56:18.505 --> 00:56:19.951
Then there is something else I 
need to explain which is duty 

00:56:19.952 --> 00:56:25.475
cycling.  When you are 
navigating with the phone and 

00:56:25.476 --> 00:56:27.319
you see the blue dot when you 
are moving along, you might 

00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:30.387
think that the GPS is on the 
continuously and it is actually 

00:56:30.388 --> 00:56:32.388
not.

00:56:33.645 --> 00:56:36.289
What's happening in the phone is
that GPS will by default be on 

00:56:36.290 --> 00:56:41.601
for a fraction of a second and 
then off for the remaining 

00:56:41.602 --> 00:56:44.065
fracturesing fraction of a 
second and then repeat.  This is

00:56:44.066 --> 00:56:46.066
to save battery.

00:56:47.357 --> 00:56:49.435
You perceive that the GPS is on 
all the time but it is duty 

00:56:49.436 --> 00:56:51.471
cycling internally.  Now for the
carrier phase processing 

00:56:54.726 --> 00:56:56.596
you have to continually track 
because the carrier wave is the 

00:56:56.597 --> 00:56:58.597
ruler with no numbers on it.

00:57:01.296 --> 00:57:03.954
If the GPS was on and your 
receiver measured the phase.  

00:57:03.955 --> 00:57:05.779
You would start processing if 
the GPS then goes off for a 

00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:08.714
fraction of a second, now you 
have lost where you were.  It 

00:57:08.715 --> 00:57:10.715
will start again.

00:57:14.208 --> 00:57:16.208
You will re akwir and you will 
never solve the problem.  Right?

00:57:17.675 --> 00:57:20.322
You need the tape measure to 
stay out and you need to process

00:57:20.323 --> 00:57:25.034
and you need to disable duty 
cycling and you can do that in 

00:57:25.035 --> 00:57:27.469
Android P with a developer 
option.  Which I will talk some 

00:57:27.470 --> 00:57:33.404
more about in a minute.  What I 
have shown on the right is a 

00:57:35.438 --> 00:57:37.438
screen shot of an application 
that we have put out.

00:57:38.938 --> 00:57:41.599
It is called GNSS logger and 
this enablings you to log the 

00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:44.886
rule measurements in the phone. 
Nice thing about this app it is 

00:57:44.887 --> 00:57:49.194
a reference app.  The code is 
open sourced and available to 

00:57:49.195 --> 00:57:51.195
you on github.

00:57:53.698 --> 00:57:55.745
So when you build your app 
please make use of our code.  

00:57:55.746 --> 00:57:57.746
And when you do build an app 
that 

00:58:00.221 --> 00:58:02.221
needs raw measurement you will 
need the 

00:58:03.280 --> 00:58:05.735
Android location manager API 
with measurements of and this 

00:58:05.736 --> 00:58:08.593
method requires to you pass a 
GNSS measurements call 

00:58:11.657 --> 00:58:13.720
back shown here.  You construct 
this call back and 

00:58:16.984 --> 00:58:18.984
override the method and unstatus
changed 

00:58:20.863 --> 00:58:23.097
and that will gir you the 
integer status to discuss.  If 

00:58:23.098 --> 00:58:25.098
they are you then override the 

00:58:28.620 --> 00:58:30.620
method on GNSS measurements 
received and 

00:58:33.707 --> 00:58:36.384
this allows you to receive a 
GNSS event, for example, every 

00:58:36.385 --> 00:58:38.792
second and this event gives you 
the values that we have been 

00:58:39.197 --> 00:58:41.197
talking about.

00:58:42.533 --> 00:58:44.533
Con stelation type and 
accumulated 

00:58:45.549 --> 00:58:47.549
Delta range

00:58:48.566 --> 00:58:50.794
.  For duty cycling that's a 
developer option.  You access 

00:58:50.795 --> 00:58:52.877
that through the developer page 
on your phone as you see there 

00:58:52.878 --> 00:58:54.878
on P.

00:58:55.989 --> 00:58:59.272
And this allows you to disable 
the duty cycle.  Now keep in 

00:58:59.273 --> 00:59:01.323
mind this dueses a tradeoff 
between getting the continuous 

00:59:03.141 --> 00:59:04.990
measurements and battery life.  
There will be an impact on 

00:59:04.991 --> 00:59:06.991
battery life.  How much?

00:59:10.294 --> 00:59:12.334
Even when GPS is on continually 
it will use less than 20% of the

00:59:12.335 --> 00:59:14.335
power that screen on users.  So 
that gives you a feel for the 

00:59:14.598 --> 00:59:16.618
magnitude.  Now this is a 
developer option 

00:59:20.094 --> 00:59:22.127
precisely because it is a 
tradeoff in battery life and we 

00:59:22.128 --> 00:59:26.024
are very concerned about 
maximizing battery life.  But if

00:59:26.025 --> 00:59:28.669
you and we together can prove 
that there is value in this 

00:59:28.670 --> 00:59:30.670
option if 

00:59:32.910 --> 00:59:35.680
people want it then it will be 
upgraded to a fully supported 

00:59:35.681 --> 00:59:38.878
API in the future.  Here is a 
block diagram that shows the 

00:59:41.732 --> 00:59:44.400
basic architecture that we 
expect if you implement an app 

00:59:44.401 --> 00:59:46.401
for high accuracy.

00:59:47.679 --> 00:59:49.679
You got the GPS and GNSS chip.

00:59:50.995 --> 00:59:53.855
GNSS's measurements come up 
through the APIs that we 

00:59:53.856 --> 00:59:55.512
described and your app live Is 
at the top in the application 

00:59:55.513 --> 00:59:57.513
layer.  You are going to need 
access to a 

01:00:00.637 --> 01:00:02.059
reference network to get the 
data that the reference stations

01:00:02.060 --> 01:00:04.060
are tracking.

01:00:05.520 --> 01:00:07.972
There are publicly available 
reference networks.  I have 

01:00:07.973 --> 01:00:10.049
listed one down at the bottom.  
IGS.

01:00:13.545 --> 01:00:15.979
org and you can get data from 
them free.  And you need to 

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.980
process that data in some kind 
of position library and that 

01:00:21.633 --> 01:00:23.633
does all carrier phase

01:00:25.873 --> 01:00:27.873
processing and that is available
for 

01:00:28.882 --> 01:00:33.658
code.  And then you are good to 
go.  Now I mention that dual 

01:00:33.659 --> 01:00:36.333
frequency gives you much faster 
convergence to the high 

01:00:36.334 --> 01:00:40.248
accuracy.  But you don't have to
wait until the dual frequent ri 

01:00:40.249 --> 01:00:43.938
phones come out.  You can start 
doing this with single frequency

01:00:43.939 --> 01:00:45.369
phones and here is is an example
of someone who has already done 

01:00:45.370 --> 01:00:47.399
this.  This an app created by 
the French 

01:00:50.975 --> 01:00:52.984
space agency and they are doing 
exactly what we show on the 

01:00:52.985 --> 01:00:55.236
block diagram on the left and 
they are achieving submeter 

01:00:57.713 --> 01:01:02.207
accuracy after a few minutes of 
convergence.  Here is some more 

01:01:02.208 --> 01:01:06.752
external analysis that's been 
done in a similar way.  This is 

01:01:06.753 --> 01:01:11.490
from a paper called positioning 
with Android GNSS.  This is 

01:01:11.491 --> 01:01:14.735
using one of those chips that I 
showed you.  The chip that goes 

01:01:14.736 --> 01:01:16.736
in cell phones that does dual 
frequency and what has been 

01:01:18.668 --> 01:01:20.545
shown here is the cumulative 
results of many different starts

01:01:20.546 --> 01:01:24.226
of the GPS and what you see is 
that most of the time the 

01:01:24.227 --> 01:01:25.884
accuracy is better than a meter.
You see that on the vertical 

01:01:25.885 --> 01:01:27.885
access 

01:01:29.949 --> 01:01:31.949
which is 0 to 1 meters and it 
gets to 

01:01:33.217 --> 01:01:35.049
better than one meter in less 
than a minute.  As long as the 

01:01:35.050 --> 01:01:37.050
phone continues to 

01:01:38.160 --> 01:01:39.774
track that carrier phase 
continuously.  Here is another 

01:01:39.775 --> 01:01:42.920
similar but different paper.  
This is using one of the chips 

01:01:42.921 --> 01:01:46.703
that's meant for cars.  So this 
was tested in a car.  Driving 

01:01:46.704 --> 01:01:48.704
around that track there and 

01:01:49.817 --> 01:01:51.888
what the plot here is showing is
the accuracy after the initial 

01:01:51.889 --> 01:01:53.889
convergence while the car was 
driving.

01:01:57.827 --> 01:01:59.827
You see with GNSS alone the 
accuracy 

01:02:00.880 --> 01:02:02.880
was one to two meters and with 
this 

01:02:04.338 --> 01:02:06.338
carrier phrase processing it is 
at a 

01:02:07.598 --> 01:02:09.598
couple of centimeters.  Of 
course, you need the device 

01:02:11.286 --> 01:02:12.974
location to be enabled and your 
app has to have location 

01:02:12.975 --> 01:02:16.597
permission.  So that's going to 
come from the user.  You need 

01:02:16.598 --> 01:02:19.097
the basic GNSS measurements.  
That's been available since 

01:02:19.098 --> 01:02:21.098
Android N.

01:02:22.554 --> 01:02:23.968
You also need this continuous 
carrier phase I have been 

01:02:23.969 --> 01:02:26.208
talking about and that's 
available in P with a developer 

01:02:27.628 --> 01:02:30.293
option and it would be nice too 
have dual frequency for fast 

01:02:30.294 --> 01:02:32.294
convergence.

01:02:33.865 --> 01:02:34.284
You need a reference network 
such as the one that I already 

01:02:34.285 --> 01:02:37.348
mentioned.  There are commercial
reference networks out there and

01:02:37.349 --> 01:02:40.403
commercially available software 
to do the same thing.  But I 

01:02:40.404 --> 01:02:43.482
recommend you start with the 
free stuff and go from there.  

01:02:43.483 --> 01:02:48.200
And then finally there is the 
app from you.  So in summary 

01:02:48.201 --> 01:02:50.201
everything we have been 

01:02:51.894 --> 01:02:53.517
showing you here we have indoor 
and outdoor technology that 

01:02:53.518 --> 01:02:55.518
that's been evolving kind of in 
parallel.

01:02:57.871 --> 01:02:59.871
In each case we have a new 
technology 

01:03:01.728 --> 01:03:03.728
in and Android P gives you 
something to access.

01:03:07.421 --> 01:03:09.421
WiFi round trip time and round 
trip time enabled access point.

01:03:13.122 --> 01:03:15.764
We give you public API to access
measurements.  So this is where 

01:03:15.765 --> 01:03:17.765
some of you can do this this 
year because if you have a 

01:03:20.655 --> 01:03:22.281
customer who owns or controls a 
venue, they can upgrade their 

01:03:22.282 --> 01:03:26.949
access points.  Sometimes just a
firmer upgrade and then you have

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:29.843
the infrastructure Android P 
comes out later this year and 

01:03:29.844 --> 01:03:34.575
you can implement something like
what Roy just demoed and have 

01:03:34.576 --> 01:03:37.414
indoor navigation or many other 
apps.  For example, someone goes

01:03:37.415 --> 01:03:40.761
in to store, where is the milk. 
You can make the world a better 

01:03:40.762 --> 01:03:42.762
place 

01:03:44.247 --> 01:03:46.247
for all of us by saving us from 
the 

01:03:48.922 --> 01:03:49.525
terny of have to ask directions 
from strangers.  

01:03:49.526 --> 01:03:51.526
(Applause.

01:03:52.533 --> 01:03:54.476
) 
   &gt;&gt; FRANK VAN DIGGELEN:  And 

01:03:54.477 --> 01:03:59.609
if you -- if you not one of 
those people who has access to 

01:03:59.610 --> 01:04:01.846
this now in a few years the 
infrastructure will naturally 

01:04:01.847 --> 01:04:05.331
evolve as access points upgrade 
to round trip time and this will

01:04:05.332 --> 01:04:08.993
be available from fused location
provider as Roy said.  Now 

01:04:08.994 --> 01:04:11.025
outdoors, okay for the this 
carrier phase process it is not 

01:04:11.026 --> 01:04:16.709
just outdoors but outdoors with 
open of sky and what you need?  

01:04:16.710 --> 01:04:18.710
Dual frequency and continuous 
carrier 

01:04:20.575 --> 01:04:22.404
phase and we give you the ooich 
API and developer option to make

01:04:22.405 --> 01:04:26.702
use of that.  And then 
application -- what can you do 

01:04:26.703 --> 01:04:29.342
outdoors with open sky?  We 
already mentioned the traffic 

01:04:31.374 --> 01:04:33.374
example and theror many other 
examples 

01:04:34.844 --> 01:04:36.844
that come to mind where existing
GPS accuracy doesn't cut it.

01:04:39.540 --> 01:04:41.540
Geo caching where people go to 
look for treasures.

01:04:45.651 --> 01:04:48.713
Precision sports monitoring, 
five meters not good enough.  

01:04:48.714 --> 01:04:51.588
One meter would be great.  
Speaking of sports more and more

01:04:51.589 --> 01:04:55.042
drone apps where you follow me 
and the drone will follow along 

01:04:55.043 --> 01:04:57.043
and videos you.

01:04:59.690 --> 01:05:00.486
It would be nice if it vid yoes 
you and not the person next 

01:05:00.487 --> 01:05:03.125
door.  There are hundreds of 
apps we want you to do that.

01:05:09.277 --> 01:05:11.774
And you and I us bend the arc of
history.

01:05:15.234 --> 01:05:17.482
I am looking forward to seeing 
you here next year.  I want to 

01:05:17.483 --> 01:05:19.483
leave you with a couple of 

01:05:20.559 --> 01:05:22.559
pointers when you build location
apps, 

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.853
build great location apps you 
must have user trust.

01:05:27.146 --> 01:05:29.396
Provide them with user 
transparency and control.  You 

01:05:29.397 --> 01:05:30.414
have to ask for location 
permissions and explain what you

01:05:30.415 --> 01:05:32.415
are doing and how it benefits 
them.

01:05:35.128 --> 01:05:38.993
When things go wrong, make your 
app recover gracefully.  If 

01:05:38.994 --> 01:05:41.139
measurements are unavailable for
some moment or something goes 

01:05:41.140 --> 01:05:46.552
wrong you can fall back to used 
location provider location.  And

01:05:46.553 --> 01:05:48.284
finally respect the battery life
tradeoffs that we have 

01:05:48.285 --> 01:05:50.779
discussed.  So I must remind you
to fill out your 

01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:55.870
surveys, please at that site.  
And as I mentioned we will be 

01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:01.175
available outside the door here 
for any questions.  So from all 

01:06:01.176 --> 01:06:03.176
three of us thank you.  
   (Applause.

01:06:04.384 --> 01:06:06.384
)

01:06:09.325 --> 01:06:11.781
   &gt;&gt; Thank you for joining this
session.

01:06:15.295 --> 01:06:17.295
Grand ambassadors will assist 
with 

01:06:19.457 --> 01:06:21.911

&gt;&gt;

01:21:16.062 --> 01:21:21.758
Welcome.  Thank you for joining.
Our session will begin soon. T 

01:21:21.759 --> 01:21:23.759
   &gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

01:21:25.173 --> 01:21:27.173
&gt;&gt;

01:23:06.181 --> 01:23:08.251
Good morning.  Thanks for coming
out early this morning.

01:23:11.977 --> 01:23:12.801
My name is John Shriver-Blake ab
I'm a product manager on 

01:23:12.802 --> 01:23:16.294
Firebase.  I am going to be 
joined later today by Mike 

01:23:16.295 --> 01:23:19.763
McDonald.  And we are here to 
talk about using Firebase at 

01:23:19.764 --> 01:23:22.810
work.  
You see, lots of people know 

01:23:22.811 --> 01:23:27.482
that Firebase is a great way to 
build great apps.  You can use 

01:23:27.483 --> 01:23:30.186
products like cloud Firestore 
and cloud functions to build 

01:23:32.024 --> 01:23:34.722
scaleable apps quickly.  You can
use products like crashlytics 

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:39.200
and performance monitoring so 
understand and improve your 

01:23:39.201 --> 01:23:44.416
app's quality.  And you can use 
products like Google analytics 

01:23:44.417 --> 01:23:47.050
for Firebase and Firebase 
predictions to understand and 

01:23:47.051 --> 01:23:49.051
grow your user.

01:23:51.205 --> 01:23:55.684
r base.  Unfortunately too many 
people think that Firebase isn't

01:23:55.685 --> 01:24:00.166
ready for work.  Particularly 
at-large organizations.  I get 

01:24:00.167 --> 01:24:02.024
questions all the time about 
security, compliance and 

01:24:02.025 --> 01:24:04.308
production readiness.  And so 
today we are going to answer 

01:24:06.369 --> 01:24:08.635
some of those questions and arm 
you with the information that 

01:24:08.636 --> 01:24:11.912
you need to use Firebase at 
work.   

01:24:13.944 --> 01:24:16.813
We are going to specifically 
cover these three areas.  Is 

01:24:16.814 --> 01:24:18.814
Firebase ready for my 
organization?

01:24:20.057 --> 01:24:20.669
Can I manage and secure my 
resources in the way that I want

01:24:20.670 --> 01:24:23.505
to?  Is Firebase ready for my 
lawyers?

01:24:27.415 --> 01:24:29.647
Can it meet my compliance and 
regulatory requirements?  Is 

01:24:29.648 --> 01:24:31.648
Firebase ready for production?

01:24:33.509 --> 01:24:36.764
Can I achieve production scale 
and monitoring with Firebase?  

01:24:36.765 --> 01:24:38.765
We are going to answer these 
questions today.  

01:24:40.305 --> 01:24:41.525
So let's take the first 
question.  Is Firebase ready for

01:24:41.526 --> 01:24:43.526
my organization?

01:24:45.218 --> 01:24:47.866
Specifically can you control 
access to Firebase resources and

01:24:47.867 --> 01:24:50.710
enforce organizational policies?
The answer is yes.

01:24:53.961 --> 01:24:56.615
Firebase developers have access 
to the same powerful Google 

01:24:56.616 --> 01:24:58.616
Cloud Platform 

01:25:00.095 --> 01:25:01.969
tools to secure and access the 
resources in Firebase.  

01:25:01.970 --> 01:25:05.218
Which is great.  Right?  And 
this works because when it comes

01:25:08.291 --> 01:25:11.551
right down to it, Firebase 
projects are cloud projects.  

01:25:11.552 --> 01:25:13.782
And while we provide a simple 
and intuitive UI to help people 

01:25:13.783 --> 01:25:15.783
onboard with 

01:25:17.070 --> 01:25:17.679
the platform, it is all built on
top of Google cloud 

01:25:17.680 --> 01:25:22.211
infrastructure.  So those who 
need the power can use the 

01:25:22.212 --> 01:25:24.212
Google Cloud Platform tools to 

01:25:25.687 --> 01:25:27.930
manage their Firebase projects. 
Now when it comes to managing 

01:25:27.931 --> 01:25:32.833
and securing access to our 
projects, there are a few core 

01:25:32.834 --> 01:25:36.079
cloud tools that you need to be 
aware of.  First is cloud 

01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:40.162
resource manager.  Which allows 
you to centrally manage all of 

01:25:40.163 --> 01:25:42.163
the projects in your 
organization.

01:25:44.076 --> 01:25:45.691
It allows an administrator to 
get visibility in to every 

01:25:45.692 --> 01:25:47.692
project they have 

01:25:50.344 --> 01:25:54.883
and organize those projects in 
to a hierarchy of folders.  

01:25:54.884 --> 01:25:56.884
Second, is cloud identity.

01:25:59.162 --> 01:25:59.761
Which provides centralized 
identity administration for 

01:25:59.762 --> 01:26:04.676
orgs.  It includes the ability 
to support single sign on and 

01:26:04.677 --> 01:26:07.119
enforce two factor 
authentication.  Now many of you

01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:11.400
are probably using G suite which
offers many of the same features

01:26:11.401 --> 01:26:13.839
and also works with Google cloud
and Firebase.  

01:26:16.072 --> 01:26:18.072
Finally, there is cloud IAM.

01:26:22.424 --> 01:26:24.424
Cloud IAM gives you fine grain 
control.

01:26:26.688 --> 01:26:28.688
Allow us to do this about I 
assigning roles.

01:26:31.449 --> 01:26:33.449
For instance, there is a role 
called 

01:26:35.308 --> 01:26:37.308
app engine viewer.

01:26:39.571 --> 01:26:41.571
On the other hand, you might 
gave an 

01:26:42.741 --> 01:26:45.207
edit role for a smaller set of 
people who need it.  If the 

01:26:45.208 --> 01:26:47.208
predefined roles are not for 
you.

01:26:51.171 --> 01:26:53.211
You can define custom roles.  
Finally I will e mention that 

01:26:53.212 --> 01:26:57.498
all permission are logged and we
give you a full audit log of 

01:26:57.499 --> 01:27:00.138
what was changed when and by 
who.  Now those of you who are 

01:27:00.139 --> 01:27:05.072
familiar with Firebase, probably
know that today Firebase does 

01:27:05.073 --> 01:27:07.104
not support fine grain roles or 
permissions which limits your 

01:27:08.942 --> 01:27:10.942
options for controlling access.

01:27:11.986 --> 01:27:13.603
Well, today we begin the rollout
of fine grain permissions for 

01:27:13.604 --> 01:27:17.719
Firebase.  We have defined a set
of permissions like stability 

01:27:17.720 --> 01:27:22.212
admin and developer viewer that 
allow you to grant access to a 

01:27:22.213 --> 01:27:23.432
limited subset of Firebase.  In 
addition we are going to give 

01:27:23.433 --> 01:27:26.746
you access to fine grain 
permissions.  So you can define 

01:27:26.747 --> 01:27:30.207
exactly the roles that make the 
most sense for you.  Now we just

01:27:30.208 --> 01:27:32.208
started rolling this out today.

01:27:34.531 --> 01:27:35.340
And it may take a few weeks 
before you see it in your 

01:27:35.341 --> 01:27:39.639
project.  But I am going to give
you a demo.  Switch over to the 

01:27:39.640 --> 01:27:43.138
screen, please.  Okay.  So here 
I am logged in to the Firebase 

01:27:47.031 --> 01:27:48.659
console as myself and I want to 
give Mike access to this 

01:27:48.660 --> 01:27:53.080
project.  So I'm going to go to 
project settings, users and 

01:27:53.081 --> 01:27:55.081
permissions.

01:27:57.792 --> 01:28:00.451
And this loads up a custom 
Firebase UI that makes it easy 

01:28:00.452 --> 01:28:02.892
for most Firebase users to add 
users to their Firebase project.

01:28:05.953 --> 01:28:07.953
Let me go ahead and add a 
member.

01:28:09.768 --> 01:28:14.285
We will include Mike.  Okay.  
And now I need to pick a role 

01:28:14.286 --> 01:28:18.771
for Mike.  When I click on the 
roll drop yun we support the 

01:28:18.772 --> 01:28:21.006
same project level roles that 
Firebase has always supported 

01:28:21.007 --> 01:28:23.693
but we can assign custom access 
to Firebase.

01:28:28.037 --> 01:28:30.037
I only need Mike to send 
notifications 

01:28:31.129 --> 01:28:33.129
and who worry a T-shirt and a 
hoodie for today's talk.

01:28:36.257 --> 01:28:38.725
I am doubting his 
professionalism.  I am only 

01:28:38.726 --> 01:28:41.598
going to give him access to grow
and not our developer products. 

01:28:41.599 --> 01:28:44.887
Save that.  And switch over to 
Mike.  So you can see on this 

01:28:44.888 --> 01:28:47.534
window I am logged in as Mike.  
I am in the same project and 

01:28:47.535 --> 01:28:49.535
because 

01:28:52.424 --> 01:28:54.424
Mike has access to grow admin, 
if I go 

01:28:56.029 --> 01:28:58.725
to -- uh-huh.  Okay.  Let's do 
this.

01:29:02.608 --> 01:29:04.608
If I go to Cloud Messaging with 
Mike's 

01:29:06.456 --> 01:29:07.891
account, he has full read write 
access to view and sent 

01:29:07.892 --> 01:29:10.539
notifications.  If I go to the 
develop section, and I 

01:29:14.013 --> 01:29:16.454
try and get in the database I 
get access denied.  I know that 

01:29:16.455 --> 01:29:18.679
Mike is not mucking around in my
data.  Some of you are probably 

01:29:18.680 --> 01:29:22.399
thinking that you need more fine
grain permissions for your 

01:29:22.400 --> 01:29:25.053
organization and we got that 
covered, too with fine grain 

01:29:25.054 --> 01:29:27.054
permissions and custom roles.

01:29:29.117 --> 01:29:31.117
Going back to my UI I am back in
the 

01:29:33.007 --> 01:29:35.457
Firebase UI for IAM and roles 
are not in this UI.  They are 

01:29:35.458 --> 01:29:37.491
considered an advanced scenario.
So I'm going to go over to 

01:29:37.492 --> 01:29:41.955
advanced permission settings and
what this is going to do is open

01:29:41.956 --> 01:29:44.205
up the cloud IAM console.  So 
these systems are working on the

01:29:46.236 --> 01:29:48.900
same Backends, same users, same 
permissions but the cloud 

01:29:48.901 --> 01:29:52.403
console has a much broader array
of features to help you control 

01:29:52.404 --> 01:29:55.248
and manage access to your 
project.  One of those features 

01:29:55.249 --> 01:29:59.349
are roles.  So I'm going to go 
ahead and click in to roles and 

01:29:59.350 --> 01:30:01.350
you can see here the full 

01:30:03.023 --> 01:30:04.839
list of roles that are 
predefined for my project and 

01:30:04.840 --> 01:30:07.284
also a role I created up here 
called Mike's special role that 

01:30:07.285 --> 01:30:10.318
has specific permissions just 
for Mike.  Now you probably 

01:30:10.319 --> 01:30:12.577
wouldn't make a specific role 
for one person.  But you get the

01:30:12.578 --> 01:30:15.854
gist.  You get the choice to 
define the roles the way you 

01:30:15.855 --> 01:30:18.317
want with the permissions that 
you want.  

01:30:20.778 --> 01:30:23.627
Finally I mentioned audit 
logging.  And we do offer quite 

01:30:23.628 --> 01:30:28.103
a bit of audit logging for these
scenarios.  I will go back to 

01:30:28.104 --> 01:30:30.104
the Cloud Platform 

01:30:31.750 --> 01:30:33.786
console, dashboard and another 
tab called activity and this 

01:30:33.787 --> 01:30:36.673
activity feed gives you a 
detailed rundown of 

01:30:38.526 --> 01:30:41.402
administration action in your 
organizations.

01:30:44.460 --> 01:30:46.891
And so you can see there is a 
record for that last change that

01:30:46.892 --> 01:30:48.892
I made.

01:30:52.668 --> 01:30:53.878
Firebase John@Gmail removed 
Firebase admin from Firebase 

01:30:53.879 --> 01:30:57.784
Mike.  That's interesting.  
That's why they didn't work.   

01:30:57.785 --> 01:31:00.437
Anyway you get the full view of 
everything that's happened in 

01:31:00.438 --> 01:31:04.901
your organization so that your 
administrators can really keep 

01:31:04.902 --> 01:31:08.379
an eye on what's happening.  So 
can we go back to the slide, 

01:31:08.380 --> 01:31:10.380
please?

01:31:14.707 --> 01:31:15.939
So a take away for you is that 
Firebase is ready for your 

01:31:15.940 --> 01:31:17.940
organization.

01:31:19.235 --> 01:31:21.695
You can use cloud powerful 
manager tools to manage your 

01:31:21.696 --> 01:31:24.134
Firebase projects and restrict 
access.  Let's talk about the 

01:31:24.135 --> 01:31:28.226
lawyers.  If you have ever tried
to deploy a new service in a 

01:31:28.227 --> 01:31:30.227
large organization you know 

01:31:32.260 --> 01:31:36.971
it can be a real challenge.  Add
to the complexity of GDPR and 

01:31:36.972 --> 01:31:41.661
the whole thing is really 
daunting.  We want to make sh as

01:31:41.662 --> 01:31:44.317
easy as possible for you.  And 
to this end the Firebase team 

01:31:44.318 --> 01:31:46.318
has 

01:31:47.570 --> 01:31:48.989
been investing a lot in 
compliance and today we are 

01:31:48.990 --> 01:31:52.847
ready to meet many organizations
compliance needs.  In addition 

01:31:52.848 --> 01:31:54.681
we have been particularly 
focused on how we can help you 

01:31:54.682 --> 01:32:01.386
implement privacy best practices
and be compliant with GDPR.  Now

01:32:01.387 --> 01:32:03.212
before I go much further I want 
to make this clear, I am not a 

01:32:03.213 --> 01:32:06.292
lawyer and this is not legal 
advice.  And we are going to 

01:32:06.293 --> 01:32:08.377
talk about general best 
practices but really every case 

01:32:08.378 --> 01:32:12.044
is different.  So if you haven't
had a conversation about these 

01:32:12.045 --> 01:32:16.932
topics with a lawyer, I strongly
suggest that you do.  Okay.  So 

01:32:16.933 --> 01:32:19.201
I had a funny experience this 
winter.  I was at an indoor 

01:32:19.202 --> 01:32:22.047
water park with my son.  And we 
were waiting to get if n line 

01:32:26.146 --> 01:32:28.176
and a couple mind me also worked
together started talking about 

01:32:28.177 --> 01:32:33.065
GDPR in line at a water park and
they were really stressed out.  

01:32:33.066 --> 01:32:35.539
They were talking about how much
work they had do, how many open 

01:32:35.540 --> 01:32:38.805
questions they had and how hard 
it was to get a clear answer to 

01:32:38.806 --> 01:32:40.843
those questions.  
And I really could not figure 

01:32:40.844 --> 01:32:43.092
out why they were talking about 
GDPR at a water park.

01:32:46.146 --> 01:32:47.972
It was only later that I 
realized that I was wearing this

01:32:47.973 --> 01:32:50.008
GDPR T-shirt.  It was my fault.

01:32:54.438 --> 01:32:56.438
My choice of T-shirt that

01:32:58.554 --> 01:33:00.395
day ruined that couple's 
vacation.  It has been a lot of 

01:33:00.396 --> 01:33:02.396
work and a fair amount of 
stress.

01:33:04.053 --> 01:33:05.059
But with the benefit of 
hindsight I have come to view it

01:33:05.060 --> 01:33:08.521
as an opportunity of it is an 
opportunity to ensure that you 

01:33:08.522 --> 01:33:10.522
are doing the right things where
users and privacy.

01:33:12.796 --> 01:33:15.074
So we are going to discuss today
our privacy best practices and 

01:33:15.075 --> 01:33:18.719
how Firebase can help you 
achieve them.  Now there is 

01:33:18.720 --> 01:33:20.770
really a lot to consider with 
privacy.  But I want to call 

01:33:20.771 --> 01:33:23.442
your attention to these three 
areas that I think require 

01:33:24.045 --> 01:33:26.045
specific focus.

01:33:27.511 --> 01:33:29.135
So one, how can you ensure that 
the third parties that you rely 

01:33:29.136 --> 01:33:31.364
on are doing the right thing 
with your user's data.

01:33:34.835 --> 01:33:36.863
Two, are you properly handling 
notice and consent from your 

01:33:36.864 --> 01:33:42.182
users.  Three, are you following
best practices around 

01:33:42.183 --> 01:33:45.856
transparency and control of user
data.  Let's dig in to No.

01:33:49.575 --> 01:33:51.575
1, today it is almost impossible
to 

01:33:53.446 --> 01:33:55.446
build an app without rely ing on
third party service.

01:33:59.398 --> 01:34:01.626
Now if those services have 
access to your user data, it is 

01:34:01.627 --> 01:34:05.902
really important that you have a
clear understanding of how that 

01:34:05.903 --> 01:34:10.377
data is used, and protected by 
those services.  You also need 

01:34:10.378 --> 01:34:13.622
to ensure that use is consistent
with your own terms of service, 

01:34:13.623 --> 01:34:15.855
privacy policy and consent 
experiences.  So you really need

01:34:15.856 --> 01:34:18.952
to understand this well.  So how
can Firebase help?

01:34:22.016 --> 01:34:23.470
First in order to for to help 
you be confident in our security

01:34:23.471 --> 01:34:25.471
and privacy 

01:34:26.527 --> 01:34:28.552
practices we have really made a 
lot of progress on getting 

01:34:28.553 --> 01:34:30.553
certifications for Firebase.

01:34:33.026 --> 01:34:35.090
You can see we have beviy of ISO
and Sox certifications and we 

01:34:35.091 --> 01:34:37.091
have been 

01:34:38.556 --> 01:34:40.556
adding certifications over the 
last several months.

01:34:43.445 --> 01:34:44.867
We added ISO2017 and ISO2018 to 
Firestore and we are going to 

01:34:44.868 --> 01:34:47.520
continue to make progress on 
those specific certifications 

01:34:47.521 --> 01:34:53.664
over the next couple of months. 
Okay.  One other thing I want to

01:34:53.665 --> 01:34:57.192
highlight in this area o DPSTs. 
They are legal agreements 

01:34:57.193 --> 01:34:59.193
between you and your third party
service provider 

01:35:02.068 --> 01:35:02.669
that govern how your data is 
protected and used by those 

01:35:02.670 --> 01:35:04.670
services.

01:35:05.731 --> 01:35:07.138
If you are subject to GDPR you 
need to have these types of 

01:35:07.139 --> 01:35:11.209
agreements in place with your 
service providers.  The good 

01:35:11.210 --> 01:35:13.654
news is that Firebase makes this
really easy.  All of Firebase 

01:35:13.655 --> 01:35:15.655
services are covered 

01:35:17.950 --> 01:35:19.950
under a GPST and included by 
default in our terms of service.

01:35:20.598 --> 01:35:22.874
So if you are using Firebase and
you have accepted our most 

01:35:22.875 --> 01:35:24.875
recent terms you 

01:35:26.131 --> 01:35:28.131
are covered under our GPSTs.  
Okay.  

01:35:29.638 --> 01:35:31.459
Let's talk about notice and 
consent.  I brought this up 

01:35:31.460 --> 01:35:34.952
because notice and consent 
standards are really changing.  

01:35:34.953 --> 01:35:37.583
And so if you haven't reviewed 
your notice and content flows 

01:35:37.584 --> 01:35:39.584
recently I strongly suggest that
you do that.

01:35:42.532 --> 01:35:44.767
The high level goal here is to 
make it really clear to users 

01:35:44.768 --> 01:35:49.686
what data you are collecting and
how that data is used.  If you 

01:35:49.687 --> 01:35:51.501
do need to get consent, you need
to really focus in on that 

01:35:51.502 --> 01:35:55.223
scenario and make sure that you 
are getting consent in an 

01:35:55.224 --> 01:35:58.692
explicit and clear way from the 
users.  Also and this is 

01:35:58.693 --> 01:36:01.549
something that people often 
miss, if you need consent, you 

01:36:03.377 --> 01:36:06.223
need to make sure you are not 
gathering data before you get 

01:36:06.224 --> 01:36:10.153
that consent.  This one trips a 
lot of people up.  Finally, you 

01:36:10.154 --> 01:36:12.799
need to make sure that consent 
is recorded properly and that 

01:36:14.834 --> 01:36:19.343
you can prove that you have it 
if you need to.  We have been 

01:36:19.344 --> 01:36:21.180
working hard to help our users 
and our developers with notice 

01:36:21.181 --> 01:36:26.493
and consent.  First we have a 
number of products today that 

01:36:26.494 --> 01:36:28.579
auto initialize on launch.  And 
therefore may start collecting 

01:36:30.833 --> 01:36:33.548
data immediately from your 
users.  You may decide that you 

01:36:33.549 --> 01:36:35.617
need consent for that data.  So 
to give you the flexibility that

01:36:39.060 --> 01:36:41.940
you need, we have updated all of
these APIs so they can be 

01:36:41.941 --> 01:36:44.449
configured to not auto 
initialize.  So you can get the 

01:36:44.450 --> 01:36:46.450
user consent that you need and 
then go ahead and 

01:36:49.787 --> 01:36:51.787
initialize those SDKs.

01:36:53.124 --> 01:36:55.124
In addition we have launched an 
update 

01:36:56.394 --> 01:36:58.026
to friendly picks that 
demonstrate how to treak user 

01:36:58.027 --> 01:37:00.027
consent using Firebase.

01:37:02.754 --> 01:37:04.377
It is an open source demo 
application built on the 

01:37:04.378 --> 01:37:06.378
Firebase platform and 

01:37:09.533 --> 01:37:10.785
includes iOS and Android.  We 
hope that you will take a look 

01:37:10.786 --> 01:37:15.082
at it and it makes it easier for
you to implement this critical 

01:37:15.083 --> 01:37:17.756
user experience.  Okay.  Finally
let's talk about transparency 

01:37:19.176 --> 01:37:23.232
and control.  The basic 
principle in this area is that 

01:37:23.233 --> 01:37:25.491
it should be easy for your users
to understand what data you have

01:37:25.492 --> 01:37:30.237
about them and they should be in
control of that data.  So a 

01:37:30.238 --> 01:37:33.087
great example of this is 
Google's my activity site.  It 

01:37:33.088 --> 01:37:35.088
shows you user as detailed view 
of 

01:37:36.957 --> 01:37:39.201
all of their data on Chrome, 
Android and Google search as 

01:37:39.202 --> 01:37:41.865
well as other Google products.  
It is quite an exhaustive set of

01:37:41.866 --> 01:37:46.345
data and provides a lot of 
transparency for our users.  It 

01:37:46.346 --> 01:37:48.346
also puts users in kroechlt they

01:37:49.815 --> 01:37:53.083
can delete pieces of data or 
delete data in bulk.  Think it 

01:37:53.084 --> 01:37:55.135
is a really great example of how
to implement transparency and 

01:37:57.591 --> 01:38:00.044
control for your products.  We 
want to help Firebase developers

01:38:01.667 --> 01:38:03.895
implement best practices in this
area.  And update that we made 

01:38:03.896 --> 01:38:07.767
recently was improving our 
support for deletion in a number

01:38:07.768 --> 01:38:10.846
of our services.  Particularly 
services like crashlytics and 

01:38:10.847 --> 01:38:15.329
Analytics.  It is now possible 
in all of these services to 

01:38:15.330 --> 01:38:17.376
delete data for a single user.  
So if you get a request to 

01:38:17.377 --> 01:38:19.649
delete data you are now 
empowered to do that.  

01:38:24.487 --> 01:38:26.487
We have also launched a deletion
and export guide.

01:38:29.015 --> 01:38:31.015
It walk through the process

01:38:32.295 --> 01:38:34.295
cess of iment pleming user 
deletion and 

01:38:35.563 --> 01:38:37.563
export flow es.

01:38:39.439 --> 01:38:41.468
s.  Now before we jump in to the
code I 

01:38:46.006 --> 01:38:47.633
want to mention that this code 
is publiclible available on 

01:38:47.634 --> 01:38:52.715
github.  You can grab it today. 
It also covers user initiated 

01:38:52.716 --> 01:39:00.028
export which is another key user
scenario for data control.  The 

01:39:00.029 --> 01:39:02.073
code itself starts out with this
function.  That's responsible 

01:39:02.074 --> 01:39:05.772
for initiating the delete.  The 
really great thing about cloud 

01:39:07.410 --> 01:39:09.410
functions is the amount of 
flexibility 

01:39:11.510 --> 01:39:12.955
that gives you and how you 
trigger that function.  We are 

01:39:12.956 --> 01:39:14.956
taking advantage of the fact 

01:39:15.996 --> 01:39:18.458
that Firebase off is an event 
emitter.  This functional 

01:39:18.459 --> 01:39:20.459
trigger when off.

01:39:22.777 --> 01:39:25.618
user on delete gets called.  So 
the basic model here you delete 

01:39:25.619 --> 01:39:30.500
the Firebase.  This function 
kicks off and deletes the rest 

01:39:30.501 --> 01:39:32.501
of their data.  It gives you a 
lot of flexibility in this area.

01:39:35.827 --> 01:39:37.827
So you can also trigger this off
of an 

01:39:40.113 --> 01:39:42.113
htpq or using the client side 
SDK.

01:39:43.583 --> 01:39:48.662
Once triggered the code goes 
through and has wipe out calls. 

01:39:48.663 --> 01:39:51.928
Skipping down a bit, this is the
database wipeout function.  You 

01:39:51.929 --> 01:39:53.763
will see in the top reading in a
list of paths and then we are 

01:39:53.764 --> 01:39:58.087
iterating through each one of 
those paths and removing them 

01:39:58.088 --> 01:40:00.168
from the database.  But where 
dot paths come from?

01:40:03.494 --> 01:40:05.494
They are near user privacy.JSON.

01:40:07.865 --> 01:40:09.865
In this case it is a path called
users 

01:40:11.381 --> 01:40:13.381
and another called admins.

01:40:14.430 --> 01:40:16.454
So we are only deleting data for
this specific user.  Other 

01:40:16.455 --> 01:40:18.455
products work in a similar way.

01:40:19.507 --> 01:40:21.507
So there is an example for 
storage 

01:40:22.569 --> 01:40:23.393
here below that will delete 
storage data for that particular

01:40:23.394 --> 01:40:26.845
user.  So that's it.  If a few 
lines of code we are properly 

01:40:28.682 --> 01:40:30.727
cleaning up our data when a 
Firebase user gets deleted.

01:40:33.991 --> 01:40:36.055
So the key take away for you is 
that Firebase is ready to meet 

01:40:36.056 --> 01:40:39.873
most organizations's compliance 
needs and we have provided a 

01:40:39.874 --> 01:40:42.546
number of tools to help you 
implement privacy best practices

01:40:42.547 --> 01:40:46.815
and be compliant with GDPR.  Now
I am going to hand over to Mike 

01:40:46.816 --> 01:40:48.816
to 

01:40:49.890 --> 01:40:51.135
talk about taking your Firebase 
product to production.  

01:40:51.136 --> 01:40:53.136
&gt;&gt; MIKE MCDONALD:  Thanks.

01:40:54.994 --> 01:40:57.216
So John convinced your manager, 
their manager their manager's 

01:40:57.217 --> 01:40:59.217
manager, all of 

01:41:00.270 --> 01:41:02.270
those pesky compliance officers 
in your org and your legal team.

01:41:03.561 --> 01:41:06.004
But now you are to come back to 
your team and convince your 

01:41:06.005 --> 01:41:08.629
operations and DevOps folks that
Firebase is ready to scale.

01:41:18.059 --> 01:41:20.059
Luckily Firebase is built on top
of Google Cloud.

01:41:22.349 --> 01:41:24.580
It can be built to scale the 
largest needs of customers 

01:41:24.581 --> 01:41:27.233
without breaking the bank.  
Firebase is built on top of 

01:41:27.234 --> 01:41:29.234
Cloud 

01:41:30.297 --> 01:41:32.297
Platform, specifically actually 
on top 

01:41:34.115 --> 01:41:38.926
of a couple of Google Cloud.  So
the same underlying database.  

01:41:38.927 --> 01:41:41.618
And that provides the 
scalability that you need to 

01:41:41.619 --> 01:41:43.619
start building on Firebase and 
scale in to Google Cloud.

01:41:46.138 --> 01:41:51.417
But scalability is nothing 
without reliability.  Firebase 

01:41:51.418 --> 01:41:53.418
offers 99.

01:41:55.709 --> 01:41:57.709
9 and 99.

01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:01.881
5SLAs on products.  That's what 
we promised.  People often see a

01:42:01.882 --> 01:42:03.920
lot better.  So we are looking 
at a chart right now 

01:42:06.951 --> 01:42:08.951
provided by Gartner.

01:42:13.241 --> 01:42:15.246
They are an industry analyst 
that is measuring uptime.  This 

01:42:15.247 --> 01:42:18.126
is storage bucket.  For 
instance, Google Cloud storage 

01:42:18.127 --> 01:42:20.127
on 

01:42:22.757 --> 01:42:25.366
GCP.  Con teshgs, 99.9% SLA is 
nine hours of downtime.  That's 

01:42:25.367 --> 01:42:29.015
540 minutes.  Over there in blue
so that's Google Cloud, that's 

01:42:29.016 --> 01:42:32.074
22 minutes of downtime which is 
99.995.

01:42:37.371 --> 01:42:40.011
So that's 4 and a half 9s of 
uptimetime observed over the 

01:42:40.012 --> 01:42:45.700
year.  It is literally query a 
bucket a couple times a second 

01:42:45.701 --> 01:42:47.701
for a year.

01:42:48.969 --> 01:42:50.969
This is a third party industry 
analyst.  

01:42:52.634 --> 01:42:54.634
We also understand that 
sometimes you 

01:42:55.698 --> 01:42:58.357
need to create resource in 
particular locations.  You want 

01:42:58.358 --> 01:43:01.248
to serve content directly from 
where your customers are or you 

01:43:03.313 --> 01:43:05.993
need to comply with legal 
regulations with various 

01:43:05.994 --> 01:43:08.664
countries.  They offer 15 
different regions around 

01:43:12.335 --> 01:43:14.564
the world and we have anounsed 
four additional regions which 

01:43:14.565 --> 01:43:16.565
are those white 

01:43:17.585 --> 01:43:19.585
dot

01:43:22.599 --> 01:43:24.640
dots that are coming zoning 
online.  I want to say I want to

01:43:24.641 --> 01:43:28.292
create this new bucket and you 
can select the region and you 

01:43:28.293 --> 01:43:30.529
can see a number of multi 
regional and regional 

01:43:30.530 --> 01:43:33.820
deployments and you can select 
what type of bucket you want and

01:43:33.821 --> 01:43:35.821
then create it in Firebase.  

01:43:38.099 --> 01:43:40.099
In the near future we expect 
that cloud 

01:43:41.180 --> 01:43:43.180
functions and Firestore will 
also offer this capability.

01:43:45.457 --> 01:43:47.457
So now that we are comfortable 

01:43:48.928 --> 01:43:50.762
creating resources and we know 
that they are scale, we need to 

01:43:50.763 --> 01:43:52.763
verify that the 

01:43:54.835 --> 01:43:56.835
code that John wrote does what 
it says it does.  

01:43:57.475 --> 01:44:00.132
To do this we will use 
Stackdriver.  So Stackdriver 

01:44:00.133 --> 01:44:02.133
provides visibility in to your 
production resources for the 

01:44:06.968 --> 01:44:08.073
entirety of Cloud Platform and 
parts of Firebase.  It does 

01:44:08.074 --> 01:44:10.074
logging, monitoring alerts and 

01:44:12.763 --> 01:44:13.984
things like tracing debugging 
and performance profiling of 

01:44:13.985 --> 01:44:18.053
here is a quick reference of 
what Firebase services support 

01:44:18.054 --> 01:44:22.543
which of those various stack 
driver integrations.  We will 

01:44:22.544 --> 01:44:24.544
dye in to how each of them work.

01:44:28.478 --> 01:44:29.676
So earlier John showed code that
was deployed on the cloud 

01:44:29.677 --> 01:44:32.316
function.  We need to ensure 
that those wipeout 

01:44:36.043 --> 01:44:38.043
functions are running and not 
erroring out.

01:44:40.999 --> 01:44:42.999
It integrates nicely with 
Stackdriver logging.

01:44:46.550 --> 01:44:48.171
As you can see this is actually 
the friendly picks production 

01:44:48.172 --> 01:44:50.648
Backend logs.  So we can see 
cleanup account, 

01:44:53.903 --> 01:44:56.131
moderate posts, send follower 
note,ifications and we can every

01:44:56.132 --> 01:45:00.262
time a function execute 
execution started as well as all

01:45:00.263 --> 01:45:02.263
the logs from standard error and
standard log of we automatically

01:45:02.571 --> 01:45:04.200
suck those up.  So you don't 
have to write anything special 

01:45:04.201 --> 01:45:06.201
in your code.

01:45:07.507 --> 01:45:09.507
You can just say standard sh 
console.

01:45:11.207 --> 01:45:13.468
log in JavaScript and it will 
log it.  Or if something errors 

01:45:13.469 --> 01:45:15.737
we will pull it out and display 
T.

01:45:19.165 --> 01:45:21.165
That's a great view.  But what 
happens if you want more 

01:45:22.765 --> 01:45:24.765
proactive error reporting.  So 
you can use Stackdriver error 

01:45:26.014 --> 01:45:27.828
reporting to understand there a 
new error.  Here is exactly 

01:45:27.829 --> 01:45:30.265
what's wrong.  John's code may 
have been error free but that's 

01:45:30.266 --> 01:45:32.266
not true for everything that we 
are running right now.

01:45:34.536 --> 01:45:36.148
We can see up at the top a bunch
of open alerts that have been 

01:45:36.149 --> 01:45:38.149
opened 

01:45:39.673 --> 01:45:42.128
because our code has thrown an 
error.  You can see that top one

01:45:42.129 --> 01:45:44.129
says deletion 

01:45:45.386 --> 01:45:48.085
of inactive user failed error 
and internal error occurred.  

01:45:48.086 --> 01:45:52.978
Quota exceeded.  It tells us 
what the problem is and how we 

01:45:52.979 --> 01:45:55.827
can resolve that in the Google 
cloud console and tells us how 

01:45:55.828 --> 01:45:58.687
many occurrences of error 
occurred and when they happened 

01:45:58.688 --> 01:46:00.688
and when the last one was 

01:46:02.368 --> 01:46:04.368
and I get e-mails for every 
single error 

01:46:07.416 --> 01:46:11.000
that occurs in friendly picks.  
It is really nice.  Now we want 

01:46:11.001 --> 01:46:12.231
to build dashboards to 
understand how things are 

01:46:12.232 --> 01:46:16.919
working in production.  
Stackdriver provides logging or 

01:46:19.566 --> 01:46:21.600
monitoring and alerting with a 
bunch of different metrics about

01:46:21.601 --> 01:46:23.601
each of these Firebase and 
Google cloud services.

01:46:29.327 --> 01:46:32.823
So you can create real ly 
granular dashboards.  Slide sin 

01:46:32.824 --> 01:46:34.046
tended to be a little 
overwhelming to show you how 

01:46:34.047 --> 01:46:36.047
much information we are giving.

01:46:40.169 --> 01:46:44.326
The realtime database spits out 
20 or 25 different metrics.  

01:46:47.375 --> 01:46:49.375
Using the Stackdriver console it
is 

01:46:52.356 --> 01:46:53.245
really easy to create custom 
dashboards and in the demo that 

01:46:53.246 --> 01:46:55.246
I will show we will 

01:46:56.397 --> 01:46:58.037
go in to greater detail and im I
will I will make a new 

01:46:58.038 --> 01:47:00.274
dashboard.  How much data is 
stored in cloud 

01:47:05.030 --> 01:47:07.030
storage and send setting alert, 
send me an e-mail.

01:47:08.704 --> 01:47:12.385
You can configure those again 
those alerts in the Stackdriver 

01:47:12.386 --> 01:47:14.386
console.

01:47:15.435 --> 01:47:17.870
So on the left side we are 
saying any time a metric goes 

01:47:17.871 --> 01:47:22.808
above that large number which 
happens to be five gigabytes any

01:47:22.809 --> 01:47:24.809
time that threshold is 

01:47:28.147 --> 01:47:30.147
exceeded, send an I alert to 
Firebase 

01:47:32.029 --> 01:47:36.816
Mike@Gmail com.  Maybe your 
company stores everything in a 

01:47:36.817 --> 01:47:38.869
Wiki or other mark down you can 
copy that in and this will get 

01:47:38.870 --> 01:47:41.733
sent along in the alert.  So you
can actually debug immediately 

01:47:43.973 --> 01:47:46.011
once you get that alert.  On the
right I have set up a bunch of 

01:47:47.641 --> 01:47:51.105
different alerts.  You can do 
some really simple things that 

01:47:51.106 --> 01:47:53.106
are just basic conditions that 
say 

01:47:54.191 --> 01:47:56.256
hey, if this metric is over five
gigabytes for more than a minute

01:47:56.257 --> 01:47:58.285
or this metric no longer exists 
send me an alert 

01:48:02.255 --> 01:48:04.255
and you can do more complicated 
things 

01:48:06.124 --> 01:48:08.124
like velocity alert.  That's 
sending mooey information that 

01:48:10.612 --> 01:48:13.042
says hey I just got this huge 
load spike.  Maybe I need to do 

01:48:13.043 --> 01:48:17.127
something or hey the number of 
objects stored in my storage 

01:48:17.128 --> 01:48:19.128
bucket has doubled.

01:48:22.490 --> 01:48:24.315
Maybe I want to start 
eliminating old data.  This is 

01:48:24.316 --> 01:48:27.375
what one of those alerts look 
like when it fires.  So I run a 

01:48:27.376 --> 01:48:31.273
couple of production services.  
One of them, for instance, I run

01:48:31.274 --> 01:48:34.126
a Minecraft server and I got an 
e-mail saying my server is down.

01:48:39.163 --> 01:48:42.464
What do I do and as you can see 
I have documentation that says 

01:48:42.465 --> 01:48:44.465
is the have, M up.  SSH in to 
the VM and make sure that 

01:48:47.993 --> 01:48:49.993
the disk are mounted and make is
your 

01:48:52.268 --> 01:48:54.297
that my system D job is working 
perfectly.  It works for various

01:48:54.298 --> 01:48:57.353
other Cloud Platform services 
that I mentioned.  And then once

01:48:57.354 --> 01:48:59.354
you acknowledge it you 

01:49:01.622 --> 01:49:03.240
get another e-mail ma says the 
incident is over and everything 

01:49:03.241 --> 01:49:05.241
is fine.

01:49:06.719 --> 01:49:09.156
We have pager duty and other 
tools like slack integrations 

01:49:09.157 --> 01:49:11.157
that you can 

01:49:12.415 --> 01:49:15.468
send them to wherever is most 
convenient for or your org.  So 

01:49:15.469 --> 01:49:18.922
we built our app.  Running in 
production and can scale.  We 

01:49:18.923 --> 01:49:20.786
have great visibility.  
Everything is going fine and you

01:49:20.787 --> 01:49:22.787
are 

01:49:23.880 --> 01:49:25.880
sitting in your desk one day and
one who 

01:49:28.757 --> 01:49:30.757
looks like John walks over and 
says how much does this cost.

01:49:36.114 --> 01:49:39.781
I need to report to my VP.  And 
you are sweating bullets.  You 

01:49:39.782 --> 01:49:41.782
go to the Cloud Platform website
and we have this awesome pricing

01:49:41.834 --> 01:49:44.266
calculator.  So on both Firebase
and Google 

01:49:47.537 --> 01:49:49.537
platform you can dial around and
say hey 

01:49:50.792 --> 01:49:52.792
based on the information I have 
in stack 

01:49:55.485 --> 01:49:57.485
driver it is projecting that I 
am going 

01:50:00.002 --> 01:50:01.634
at X gigabytes of data store a 
month and the Cloud Platform 

01:50:01.635 --> 01:50:07.385
pricing calculator you can start
tweaking things like I I want to

01:50:07.386 --> 01:50:09.386
move this data to a cheaper 
storage class of it is not being

01:50:10.231 --> 01:50:12.231
accessed as frequently.

01:50:14.264 --> 01:50:19.081
That's going to be cheaper for 
you.  And similar to Stackdriver

01:50:19.082 --> 01:50:21.082
we have 

01:50:23.376 --> 01:50:25.849
kind of the estimation portion 
and you can set up billing 

01:50:25.850 --> 01:50:27.850
alerts on top of that.

01:50:28.914 --> 01:50:31.143
Maybe you budget $1,000 a month 
for storage costs.  You can set 

01:50:31.144 --> 01:50:34.003
iP a budget that will send you a
billing alert when you have 

01:50:34.214 --> 01:50:37.269
exceeded that.  It is really 
nifty.  Let's actually see that.

01:50:39.708 --> 01:50:42.141
Switching over to the demo, we 
are going to go through all of 

01:50:42.142 --> 01:50:44.809
those things just so that you 
believe me.  Okay.

01:50:50.490 --> 01:50:52.490
Here we are in the

01:50:53.844 --> 01:50:55.844
Google Cloud console.  You can 
see this massive scrolling 

01:50:56.127 --> 01:50:58.127
things.

01:51:00.443 --> 01:51:02.482
It is not just cloud function.  
Can show up in here and I can 

01:51:02.483 --> 01:51:04.483
get certain methods.

01:51:06.542 --> 01:51:08.818
I can get all of the Google 
Cloud project things and you can

01:51:08.819 --> 01:51:12.317
see when service accounts were 
used but let's focus on the 

01:51:12.318 --> 01:51:15.217
cloud functions.  Within that 
you can also get per function 

01:51:15.218 --> 01:51:19.711
logs.  So as you can see I have 
a ton of a ton of a ton of 

01:51:19.712 --> 01:51:23.762
different functions running in 
friendly picks.  Let's say I 

01:51:23.763 --> 01:51:28.477
only care about all of the 
delete old post functions.  So 

01:51:28.478 --> 01:51:30.294
you can filter based on that and
see a list of every sirn gel one

01:51:30.295 --> 01:51:36.196
of those that's happened.  You 
can go back to the full one.  

01:51:36.197 --> 01:51:37.444
You can also see things 
registered by errors or 

01:51:37.445 --> 01:51:41.955
warnings.  So filter based on 
that and I think there is some 

01:51:41.956 --> 01:51:43.621
regular expression filtering as 
well.  If you know what you are 

01:51:43.622 --> 01:51:49.161
looking for you can start typing
and say hey, let's see on 

01:51:49.162 --> 01:51:51.162
succeeded.

01:51:52.282 --> 01:51:56.176
Succeed.  Let's try that.  
Nothing found.  Darn.  Okay.

01:51:59.643 --> 01:52:01.643
So logging, and then let's pop 
over to error reporting.

01:52:04.948 --> 01:52:06.373
So you can see friendly picks is
three throwing a couple of 

01:52:06.374 --> 01:52:08.374
errors in production.

01:52:10.391 --> 01:52:12.391
Error permission

01:52:13.572 --> 01:52:15.416
denied last occurred 20 hours 
ago.  It will load and tell us 

01:52:15.417 --> 01:52:19.691
hey this part in your code you 
can actually see a bunch of 

01:52:19.692 --> 01:52:21.692
other errors that have been 
thrown.

01:52:23.619 --> 01:52:26.270
Maybe we should go and fix that.
The other thing you can say hey,

01:52:26.271 --> 01:52:28.271
maybe I actually don't care 
about this.

01:52:33.251 --> 01:52:35.251
We will mark it as resolved.  Go
back.

01:52:39.073 --> 01:52:39.196
And it no longer shows up.  So 
we filtered.  Maybe I actually 

01:52:39.197 --> 01:52:41.197
do care about the 

01:52:43.290 --> 01:52:44.695
resolved and I can see it there.
It is a nice way of managing the

01:52:44.696 --> 01:52:46.696
kind of day-to-day operations of
your 

01:52:48.273 --> 01:52:51.271
application.  Okay.  Pop over to
the Stackdriver console.  And 

01:52:51.272 --> 01:52:53.305
you can see that same dashboard 
that I showed you earlier.  We 

01:52:53.306 --> 01:52:55.306
have data stored and bandwidth. 
We have a the number of database

01:52:57.576 --> 01:52:59.823
requests and number of storage 
requests.  I want to know when 

01:52:59.824 --> 01:53:03.490
are my functions executing and 
what's happening to them.  So 

01:53:03.491 --> 01:53:05.491
I'm going to go and say add a 
chart.

01:53:09.234 --> 01:53:12.520
We will call this functions 
executions.  Cloud functions.  

01:53:12.521 --> 01:53:14.521
And you can see that we have a 
metric called executions.

01:53:16.025 --> 01:53:17.043
That's a count of executions 
broken down by status code, for 

01:53:17.044 --> 01:53:22.149
instance.  And you can actually 
see the name of the function, 

01:53:22.150 --> 01:53:26.870
and the value in kind of number 
of executions per second.  If I 

01:53:26.871 --> 01:53:31.401
wanted to I could also group by 
say the function name.  And you 

01:53:31.402 --> 01:53:33.032
will get not only -- this is 
kind of the aggregate sum of all

01:53:33.033 --> 01:53:37.913
of the things that are happening
in my function.  But I could if 

01:53:37.914 --> 01:53:39.914
I wanted to.

01:53:41.374 --> 01:53:45.971
Instead filter by give me 
functions that are okay.  So 

01:53:45.972 --> 01:53:47.199
only give me the functions that 
are succeeding or only give me 

01:53:47.200 --> 01:53:49.200
the functions that are failing.

01:53:52.881 --> 01:53:54.881
And maybe here I also want to 
group

01:53:56.422 --> 01:53:58.422
by the function name.

01:53:59.480 --> 01:54:01.507
And we will save that.  And it 
will actually give me the 

01:54:02.318 --> 01:54:04.575
historical information as well. 
So you can see this one 

01:54:04.576 --> 01:54:06.576
particular day May 7th a couple 
of days ago we had a 

01:54:09.493 --> 01:54:11.335
huge spike and we were getting 
two cleanup account requests 

01:54:11.336 --> 01:54:15.626
every second for this little 
period of time.  And actually 

01:54:15.627 --> 01:54:17.627
you can see that, there is a 
sliding line on the screen.

01:54:20.456 --> 01:54:22.456
So you can actually time 
correlate 

01:54:23.486 --> 01:54:25.486
across different things

01:54:26.839 --> 01:54:27.249
.  You can also ind kind of zom 
in and I want to look at this 

01:54:27.250 --> 01:54:29.496
particular time.  Between 2 p.m.
and 2:10 p.m.

01:54:33.940 --> 01:54:36.500
we had a huge spike and that 
corresponded to a bunch of 

01:54:36.501 --> 01:54:38.501
changes in 

01:54:39.954 --> 01:54:41.806
database and storage and 
function.  You can see exactly 

01:54:41.807 --> 01:54:43.807
what's going on 

01:54:45.277 --> 01:54:47.277
across the different products.

01:54:48.535 --> 01:54:50.573
Speaking of alerting we can hop 
over.  We can look at, for 

01:54:50.574 --> 01:54:53.423
instance, the alerting policy on
that velocity alert.

01:54:56.695 --> 01:54:58.104
You can see nothing interest can
has happened.  Maybe we want to 

01:54:58.105 --> 01:55:03.006
edit it.  We have say found out 
that it doubling is not that 

01:55:03.007 --> 01:55:05.007
troubling.  Like that.  That 
rhymed.

01:55:07.887 --> 01:55:09.887
But let's edit that and say if 
it goes 

01:55:11.599 --> 01:55:13.638
up by 500% we want to change 
that.  We can save the condition

01:55:13.639 --> 01:55:16.941
and save the policy and if 
something changes, we will get 

01:55:16.942 --> 01:55:20.019
alerted about it.  I will try 
one that I think is going to be 

01:55:20.020 --> 01:55:22.020
fun.

01:55:23.920 --> 01:55:25.920
So it looks like we have just 
about a gigabyte of data.

01:55:27.410 --> 01:55:29.410
I'm going to set up a -- I'm 
going to 

01:55:33.940 --> 01:55:35.750
change my storage over quota 
threshold.  I will edit that and

01:55:35.751 --> 01:55:37.751
I will actually 

01:55:41.076 --> 01:55:43.076
just say -- so it is currently 
at 5 gigabytes.

01:55:45.108 --> 01:55:48.030
I will set that to -- that's 
still higher than what I have.

01:55:52.926 --> 01:55:55.773
So we will drop that -- there we
go.  So we will drop it below 

01:55:55.774 --> 01:55:58.238
the threshold and we will save. 
We will save that and I'll keep 

01:55:58.239 --> 01:56:00.239
going through the demo.

01:56:02.298 --> 01:56:04.298
But at the end you can see I 
have e-mail tabs over here.

01:56:06.978 --> 01:56:09.209
I will see if it will send me an
e-mail to say that that thing 

01:56:09.210 --> 01:56:11.210
fired and I should go and deal 
with it.

01:56:15.159 --> 01:56:17.831
It may take awhile, we only kind
of check once a day what the 

01:56:17.832 --> 01:56:19.832
bucket size is.

01:56:20.947 --> 01:56:23.650
But I can do things like 
database requests or storage 

01:56:23.651 --> 01:56:26.303
requests or function executions 
that are updated more frequently

01:56:26.304 --> 01:56:32.260
or get alerted more frequently 
there.  Okay.  So lastly we are 

01:56:32.261 --> 01:56:34.261
going to set up budget alerts.

01:56:36.548 --> 01:56:37.365
So going back I want to say this
is a server that I am running 

01:56:37.366 --> 01:56:39.626
myself.  I am paying for this 
with my personal credit card.

01:56:42.687 --> 01:56:45.992
I want to know when I am 
spending $50 a month.  I have 

01:56:45.993 --> 01:56:48.543
set up an alert that says notify
me when this project is over $50

01:56:51.031 --> 01:56:53.031
a month and I can set up 
percentage alerts as well.

01:56:56.986 --> 01:56:58.824
When I am at $25, $45 and $100 a
month.  This is not going to 

01:56:58.825 --> 01:57:00.825
shut my server down.  Everything
is going to keep going.

01:57:04.717 --> 01:57:07.375
So let's kind of of a two edged 
sword.  If your website goes on 

01:57:07.376 --> 01:57:09.421
hacker news and get this huge 
load spike you don't 

01:57:12.886 --> 01:57:14.886
want the "hug of death" where 
everyone 

01:57:16.815 --> 01:57:18.815
goes on hacker news and your 
sweb 

01:57:21.081 --> 01:57:23.081
website is returning 429 the or 
402s for 

01:57:27.067 --> 01:57:29.067
quota exceeded website ir 
errors.

01:57:30.881 --> 01:57:35.012
If you want you can also 
programmatically manage these.  

01:57:35.013 --> 01:57:36.258
If you you could hook up Pub/Sub
to a cloud function to go 

01:57:36.259 --> 01:57:38.693
anywhere you want.  So there are
a lot of really nice 

01:57:38.896 --> 01:57:40.896
integrations.

01:57:41.998 --> 01:57:44.030
I will save this, I'll move it 
back down to 10 and I will 

01:57:44.031 --> 01:57:48.331
actually see if I can quota 
alert myself.  So I changed it. 

01:57:48.332 --> 01:57:51.222
I have already spent $18.  It 
should probably send me an 

01:57:51.223 --> 01:57:53.740
e-mail oh, my God, Mike you are 
blowing through all of your 

01:57:53.741 --> 01:57:57.608
money.  You should stop.  We 
will actually pop over.  I have 

01:57:57.609 --> 01:57:59.609
filters.  So unfortunately it 
doesn't look like 

01:58:02.138 --> 01:58:04.579
that's storage one fired but I 
have kind of a bunch of 

01:58:04.580 --> 01:58:06.005
historical alerts from 
Stackdriver.  Here is what they 

01:58:06.006 --> 01:58:08.006
look like.

01:58:09.097 --> 01:58:10.335
You can say hey this is what it 
started.  And here is the 

01:58:10.336 --> 01:58:12.982
project.  You can view it.  It 
will pop you back over to the 

01:58:15.035 --> 01:58:17.478
Stackdriver console and then 
once it is resolved, again you 

01:58:17.479 --> 01:58:22.413
get that nice resolution e-mail.
And I'll see if I got another 

01:58:22.414 --> 01:58:25.689
e-mail from the other billing 
alert.  No, it doesn't look like

01:58:25.690 --> 01:58:30.823
it.  But again here is a 
previous one that I fired.  Sent

01:58:30.824 --> 01:58:32.824
it hey, you have hit 100% of 
your $50 a month budget.

01:58:35.319 --> 01:58:36.959
Maybe you should go deal with 
that.  Let's go back to the 

01:58:36.960 --> 01:58:38.960
slides.

01:58:40.622 --> 01:58:42.622
So John started the presentation
by 

01:58:45.114 --> 01:58:46.551
talking about what Firebase 
provides to make sure that your 

01:58:46.552 --> 01:58:49.192
organization can use it.  The 
fine grained control that you 

01:58:49.193 --> 01:58:51.193
and 

01:58:52.240 --> 01:58:54.277
your team need so that, you 
know, I'm not mucking around, 

01:58:54.278 --> 01:58:56.307
sending crazy push notifications
or screwing with data in the 

01:58:56.308 --> 01:58:58.308
database.

01:58:59.370 --> 01:59:01.370
I'm only doing exactly what I in
my role need.

01:59:03.481 --> 01:59:05.514
John also showed how you can 
provide a great foundation for 

01:59:05.515 --> 01:59:08.192
compliance and legal 
requirements through Firebase.  

01:59:08.193 --> 01:59:11.065
So your lawyers are going to be 
happy with it.  And lastly we 

01:59:11.066 --> 01:59:13.529
just went through how Firebase 
handles global scale and gives 

01:59:14.776 --> 01:59:16.406
you visibility in to everything 
that's happening in your app 

01:59:16.407 --> 01:59:18.407
both from a production 
standpoint as well as a 

01:59:19.464 --> 01:59:21.464
financial standpoint.

01:59:24.434 --> 01:59:25.843
So yes, Firebase is ready for 
work.  Thank you all very much 

01:59:25.844 --> 01:59:27.844
for coming.  John and I will be 
over in the 

01:59:33.360 --> 01:59:37.529
Firebase Flutter and cloud sandz
sandbox after this talk.  We are

01:59:37.530 --> 01:59:39.530
happy to talk to you about any 
and all user needs.

01:59:43.470 --> 01:59:44.900
Enjoy the last day of Google 
I/O. 

01:59:44.901 --> 01:59:46.901
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

01:59:49.363 --> 01:59:51.000
Grand ambassadors will assist 
you to making room to the ex-sis

01:59:51.001 --> 01:59:54.675
the.  Have you registered for 
the next session in this room we

01:59:54.676 --> 01:59:56.676
ask that you 

01:59:57.952 --> 01:59:58.974
please clear the room and return
via the registration line 

01:59:58.975 --> 02:00:00.011
outside.  Thank you.  
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:00:00.012 --> 02:00:00.222
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:00:00.223 --> 02:00:00.424
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:00:00.425 --> 02:00:02.425
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:00:03.630 --> 02:00:05.630
&gt;&gt;

02:01:06.491 --> 02:01:07.308
An accessible process for 
inclusive design. 

02:01:07.309 --> 02:01:09.309
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:01:10.514 --> 02:01:12.514
&gt;&gt;

02:17:59.506 --> 02:18:01.506
Welcome.

02:18:03.380 --> 02:18:04.929
Please fill in the seats near 
the front of the room.  Thank 

02:18:04.930 --> 02:18:05.132
you.  
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:18:05.133 --> 02:18:05.532
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:18:05.533 --> 02:18:07.533
&gt;&gt;. 
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:18:08.755 --> 02:18:10.755
&gt;&gt;

02:21:10.719 --> 02:21:13.163
Welcome.  Thank you for joining.

02:21:17.622 --> 02:21:19.622
Our session will begin soon

02:22:22.163 --> 02:22:24.163
.  
   &gt;&gt;. 

02:22:26.438 --> 02:22:28.438
&gt;&gt;

02:23:14.440 --> 02:23:19.151
Hi everybody.  Thanks for 
coming.  We are really excited 

02:23:19.152 --> 02:23:21.152
to have you all here today.

02:23:23.997 --> 02:23:28.698
My name Jen Devins.  I lead the 
user experience team for Google 

02:23:28.699 --> 02:23:30.730
accessibility and with me I have
Andrea Wong, she is a researcher

02:23:30.731 --> 02:23:32.731
on accessibility.

02:23:35.464 --> 02:23:37.712
Catherine Idylle who is a 
designer on accessibility and 

02:23:37.713 --> 02:23:39.713
Bethany Fong, who is 

02:23:42.211 --> 02:23:44.250
the lead designer on Google 
material design.  We are happy 

02:23:44.251 --> 02:23:46.696
to have a great crowd that's 
interested in inclusive design 

02:23:46.900 --> 02:23:48.932
and accessibility.  
And we are looking forward to 

02:23:48.933 --> 02:23:52.526
sharing with you how you can 
make your products more 

02:23:52.527 --> 02:23:54.527
inclusive.  

02:23:57.817 --> 02:23:59.651
But before we dive in and get in
to specifics we wanted to start 

02:23:59.652 --> 02:24:02.983
with some basics.  What is 
accessibility and inclusive 

02:24:04.826 --> 02:24:06.857
design and why it is important. 
As describe by the web 

02:24:06.858 --> 02:24:08.858
accessibility 

02:24:10.315 --> 02:24:12.759
initiative, accessibility 
usability and inclusive design 

02:24:12.760 --> 02:24:14.760
are all very closely related.

02:24:18.933 --> 02:24:20.116
Their goals approaches and 
guidelines overlap 

02:24:20.117 --> 02:24:22.185
significantly.  And when we sit 
down to design and 

02:24:25.472 --> 02:24:26.502
develop our apps, it is really 
effective to address them 

02:24:26.503 --> 02:24:30.965
together.  
Let's start with accessibility.

02:24:34.436 --> 02:24:36.436
Accessibility focuses on 
enabling 

02:24:38.984 --> 02:24:40.984
users with disabilities to 
perceive 

02:24:43.521 --> 02:24:45.577
interact, understand, and 
navigate tools and services and 

02:24:45.578 --> 02:24:50.241
products.  And that they can 
contribute equally without 

02:24:50.242 --> 02:24:52.242
barriers.  Now some of the 
guidelines we think 

02:24:55.332 --> 02:24:57.332
about with accessibility such as
clearer 

02:24:59.601 --> 02:25:01.453
color contrast, or clearer 
concise writing are useful not 

02:25:01.454 --> 02:25:03.454
only to users 

02:25:04.535 --> 02:25:06.573
with disabilities but also those
that might be -- or that don't 

02:25:06.574 --> 02:25:09.438
have disabilities but might be 
in different situations.

02:25:13.103 --> 02:25:15.556
For example, we know that 
alternative text can be useful 

02:25:15.557 --> 02:25:20.494
to users who are blind and can't
see the screen as it describes 

02:25:20.495 --> 02:25:22.495
the imaginary and visual icons.

02:25:24.078 --> 02:25:26.911
Alternative text can also be 
useful to users who might be out

02:25:26.912 --> 02:25:28.912
in remote 

02:25:30.198 --> 02:25:32.198
locations with low bandwidth or 
using old technology.

02:25:34.670 --> 02:25:36.670
Another example it is clear that

02:25:38.360 --> 02:25:40.832
providing enough time for users 
to interact with and read 

02:25:40.833 --> 02:25:46.332
content on the screen is useful 
for users who might have a motor

02:25:46.333 --> 02:25:48.333
impairment or cognitive 
impairment.

02:25:51.884 --> 02:25:54.312
This extra time is also very 
useful for users that might be 

02:25:54.313 --> 02:25:56.313
learning a new 

02:25:58.425 --> 02:26:00.425
language or have low literacy or

02:26:01.685 --> 02:26:03.685
children learning to read or 
people distracted.

02:26:05.546 --> 02:26:06.977
And this is how accessibility is
a key component of inclusive 

02:26:06.978 --> 02:26:08.978
design.  

02:26:12.693 --> 02:26:14.693
And inclusive design is all 
about 

02:26:15.796 --> 02:26:17.796
considering the wide range of 
human abilities.

02:26:22.150 --> 02:26:26.868
We think of age, gender, 
ethnicity, and others.  And as 

02:26:26.869 --> 02:26:29.095
you can see accessibility 
overlaps significantly with 

02:26:29.096 --> 02:26:31.570
these areas as well.  
And that's why we feel like 

02:26:35.273 --> 02:26:37.273
accessibility is a really clear 
starting point.

02:26:40.362 --> 02:26:42.362
So at this point we could just 
throw 

02:26:44.679 --> 02:26:46.933
up on the screen a checklist of 
guidelines for you to follow to 

02:26:46.934 --> 02:26:49.988
ensure to make sure that your 
product is accessible and that's

02:26:49.989 --> 02:26:51.989
a great place to start, no doubt
about it.

02:26:55.127 --> 02:26:57.127
However what we have seen is may
often 

02:26:58.408 --> 02:27:00.870
lead to a product that's 
technically accessible but not 

02:27:00.871 --> 02:27:04.790
necessarily useable let alone a 
great experience for all users. 

02:27:08.112 --> 02:27:11.771
And this is where usability 
comes in to play.  Now how many 

02:27:11.772 --> 02:27:13.772
people by a quick show of hands 
take time to reach out and get 

02:27:15.470 --> 02:27:18.739
feedback and input from users?  
Quick show of hands.  It is an 

02:27:18.740 --> 02:27:20.740
important and really useful 
thing to do, right?

02:27:24.078 --> 02:27:26.719
Unfortunately, we know that a 
lot of users with disabilities 

02:27:26.720 --> 02:27:29.847
are left out of this really key 
critical point in the process.

02:27:33.315 --> 02:27:35.315
If we are not out there talking 
and 

02:27:36.789 --> 02:27:39.266
observing our users, we will 
never understand what are their 

02:27:39.267 --> 02:27:41.267
true experiences.

02:27:44.722 --> 02:27:46.722
What are their challenges

02:27:49.357 --> 02:27:50.979
.  And most importantly what are
their insights that could 

02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:55.064
actually benefit everyone.  And 
in the end you could be left 

02:28:00.763 --> 02:28:02.763
missing out on a large number of

02:28:09.639 --> 02:28:11.639
potential users and also miss 
out on 

02:28:13.253 --> 02:28:17.519
helping existing users who might
be in these limiting situations.

02:28:13.253 --> 02:28:15.253
Okay.

02:28:17.549 --> 02:28:17.563
So that's the basics.  We got 
the stage set.  

02:28:17.564 --> 02:28:19.472
Now we want to walk you through 
more of a case study to 

02:28:19.473 --> 02:28:21.322
demonstrate how to design and 
develop with accessibility in 

02:28:21.323 --> 02:28:23.323
mind.  We are going to today we 
are going to 

02:28:26.564 --> 02:28:29.099
use our fictional app called 
Crane and we are going to use 

02:28:29.100 --> 02:28:30.935
this throughout the rest of the 
talk to demonstrate specifics of

02:28:30.936 --> 02:28:32.936
how 

02:28:37.467 --> 02:28:39.467
to make products more inclusive 
as well 

02:28:40.958 --> 02:28:43.605
as material design system which 
includes clear guidelines, 

02:28:43.606 --> 02:28:49.504
components and tooling.   
Okay.  So to get this started we

02:28:49.505 --> 02:28:51.505
are going to 

02:28:52.571 --> 02:28:54.571
break it down in to four primary
stages.

02:28:55.851 --> 02:28:57.851
We have defining a product 
vision, 

02:28:59.744 --> 02:29:01.777
design development and after 
design.  Now this framework 

02:29:01.778 --> 02:29:06.060
probably seems familiar to you. 
And that's on purpose.  We are 

02:29:06.061 --> 02:29:08.507
not here to introduce yet 
another process for you to 

02:29:08.508 --> 02:29:10.508
follow.

02:29:11.772 --> 02:29:14.247
Instead we she as a toolkit of 
ideas and things that you can do

02:29:14.248 --> 02:29:16.248
to enhance 

02:29:17.731 --> 02:29:19.731
your product to make it more 
inclusive.

02:29:22.254 --> 02:29:23.689
Because in the end inclusive 
design is really just simply 

02:29:23.690 --> 02:29:25.690
good design.  
Okay.

02:29:30.017 --> 02:29:32.017
So now Andrea is going to walk 
through 

02:29:35.270 --> 02:29:37.270
the first stage of defining the 
product vision. 

02:29:37.557 --> 02:29:40.224
&gt;&gt; ANDREA WONG:  Stage 1, 
defining the production vision. 

02:29:40.225 --> 02:29:43.076
No matter what you are building,
understanding what problems or 

02:29:43.077 --> 02:29:48.200
solving for users is a key to 
product success.  So who are 

02:29:48.201 --> 02:29:50.870
your users?  Most teams start 
with the assumption 

02:29:54.128 --> 02:29:56.568
that all their users are fully 
abled.  But that may not always 

02:29:56.569 --> 02:29:58.569
be the case.

02:29:59.822 --> 02:30:02.069
So let's say you are building a 
photos app and you think well, 

02:30:02.070 --> 02:30:04.070
why would 

02:30:06.999 --> 02:30:09.234
someone who was blind use my 
photos app.  A person who is 

02:30:09.235 --> 02:30:11.235
blind may use your app because 
they want to take photos and 

02:30:12.909 --> 02:30:15.766
then share them with friends and
families or post them on social 

02:30:15.767 --> 02:30:17.767
media just like everyone else.

02:30:19.680 --> 02:30:22.369
Consider these three people on 
the screen.

02:30:26.250 --> 02:30:28.250
There is a man in a wheelchair 
with 

02:30:29.541 --> 02:30:31.541
Lou Gerig's disease.  There a 
boy with a broken arm and 

02:30:34.899 --> 02:30:37.339
there a woman holding a full bag
of groceries.  Let's have a pop 

02:30:37.340 --> 02:30:42.439
quiz.  Which of these three 
people have limited mobility?  

02:30:42.440 --> 02:30:44.440
Raise your hand if you think it 
is the 

02:30:46.085 --> 02:30:48.085
man in the wheelchair

02:30:49.195 --> 02:30:52.045
.  Okay.  Hands down.  Raise 
your hand if you think it is the

02:30:55.067 --> 02:30:57.614
boy.  Thank you.  And lastly 
raise your hand if you 

02:31:01.423 --> 02:31:03.423
think it is the woman

02:31:05.251 --> 02:31:07.251
.  So if you raised your hands 
all three 

02:31:08.318 --> 02:31:10.318
times you are correct.  

02:31:12.629 --> 02:31:14.895
All three of them have a 
different relationship with 

02:31:14.896 --> 02:31:17.557
limited mobility whether it is 
permanent like the man, 

02:31:19.378 --> 02:31:21.422
temporary like the boy.  Or 
situational like the woman with 

02:31:21.423 --> 02:31:26.732
the groceries.  Yet they are all
experiencing the exact same need

02:31:26.733 --> 02:31:28.733
right now.

02:31:29.781 --> 02:31:31.860
It is a good reminder that for 
every single one of us we will 

02:31:31.861 --> 02:31:38.019
have accessibility needs at some
point throughout our lifetime.  

02:31:38.020 --> 02:31:43.400
Disability is a much broader 
term than we might think.  And 

02:31:43.401 --> 02:31:45.654
often when something doesn't 
work well for a user with no 

02:31:45.655 --> 02:31:49.948
disabilities that pain point is 
amplified for people with 

02:31:49.949 --> 02:31:54.434
disabilities.  And that's 
actually good news for you.  

02:31:54.435 --> 02:31:56.435
Because it gives you much 
clearer 

02:31:57.953 --> 02:31:59.953
signals of what you should be 
focusing 

02:32:02.230 --> 02:32:02.291
on because when everything 
doesn't -- when something 

02:32:02.292 --> 02:32:04.755
doesn't work for everyone it 
clearly is something you should 

02:32:04.756 --> 02:32:08.126
be paying attention to.  And 
that's in fact, what we found 

02:32:08.127 --> 02:32:10.995
with our studies at Google.  All
users have the same core needs 

02:32:13.259 --> 02:32:15.500
because they are all trying to 
meet the same goal, whether it 

02:32:15.501 --> 02:32:17.501
is sending a 

02:32:20.842 --> 02:32:22.668
photograph, writing an e-mail, 
buying crypto kitties whatever 

02:32:22.669 --> 02:32:26.180
it is.  You are probably asking 
how do I do research with people

02:32:26.181 --> 02:32:29.045
with disabilities?  The answer 
is do what you usually do.

02:32:33.534 --> 02:32:36.230
Are you let's say in the early 
stage right now where you are 

02:32:36.231 --> 02:32:40.173
just chatting and sitting down 
and talking to users?  If you 

02:32:40.174 --> 02:32:43.029
are, that's actually the easiest
and the best time to be 

02:32:47.494 --> 02:32:48.125
including users with 
disabilities inies in to your 

02:32:48.126 --> 02:32:53.033
process.  You can get their 
contexts and needs right from 

02:32:53.034 --> 02:32:57.112
the very start.  You can ask the
exact same questions as you 

02:32:57.113 --> 02:32:59.113
would to someone without 
disabilities.

02:33:01.898 --> 02:33:03.898
The only difference is you have 
to ask 

02:33:04.969 --> 02:33:05.793
a few additional questions about
the assistive technologies that 

02:33:05.794 --> 02:33:07.794
they are using and their context
of use.

02:33:11.149 --> 02:33:13.419
So, for example, you will be 
asking say how do you use your 

02:33:13.420 --> 02:33:15.420
assistive 

02:33:17.045 --> 02:33:19.045
technologies when you are

02:33:20.977 --> 02:33:22.977
navigating a mobile device.  How
does it impact your interactions

02:33:24.025 --> 02:33:26.723
when you are planning travel or 
maybe even which work arounds if

02:33:26.724 --> 02:33:29.021
any, do you use to get to what 
you need.

02:33:32.923 --> 02:33:35.562
And always always follow up 
after each question with why.  

02:33:35.563 --> 02:33:39.838
Tell me more.  To really dig in 
there to give the context of 

02:33:39.839 --> 02:33:44.936
their needs.  The bonus here is 
their answers may inspire new 

02:33:44.937 --> 02:33:47.789
ways of interactions that you 
have never thought of before.

02:33:51.717 --> 02:33:54.583
Or maybe you are passed that 
stage already.  Right now you 

02:33:54.584 --> 02:33:59.716
are testing a low Fidelity like 
paper prototype.  That's fine.  

02:33:59.717 --> 02:34:03.826
You can still test people with 
disabilities.  Let's say you are

02:34:03.827 --> 02:34:05.827
testing with a user 

02:34:07.307 --> 02:34:09.556
who is blind and uses a screen 
reader which is an assistive 

02:34:09.557 --> 02:34:12.849
technology that reads out loud 
the content on the screen.  So 

02:34:12.850 --> 02:34:14.903
you are doing that.  But you 
don't have a screen reader 

02:34:16.530 --> 02:34:19.205
friendly prototype.  What you 
can do here though is write a 

02:34:21.251 --> 02:34:23.293
script of what the screen reader
might verbalize and have someone

02:34:23.294 --> 02:34:27.591
on your team act as a screen 
reader.  And that person can 

02:34:27.592 --> 02:34:29.875
read each step outloud to the 
user as they walk through 

02:34:34.567 --> 02:34:36.567
the user flow during the study 
session.

02:34:38.675 --> 02:34:39.900
By integrating people with 
disabilities whenever you are 

02:34:39.901 --> 02:34:42.577
talking to people without 
disabilities you are 

02:34:44.615 --> 02:34:47.062
automatically ensuring that 
their viewpoints will be 

02:34:47.063 --> 02:34:49.291
included in part of the process 
throughout the entire design 

02:34:52.392 --> 02:34:56.094
and development phases.  
Along with understanding user 

02:34:56.095 --> 02:34:58.095
needs you 

02:34:59.518 --> 02:35:00.543
need to have a general 
comprehension of assistive 

02:35:00.544 --> 02:35:02.544
technologies.  And the 
difference tools that people 

02:35:05.527 --> 02:35:07.494
may use interact with your 
product.  Trying the 

02:35:07.495 --> 02:35:09.495
technologies yourself is a great
place to start.

02:35:12.436 --> 02:35:16.983
But the best way to learn is to 
observe the real experts.  Those

02:35:16.984 --> 02:35:19.230
are the people who use these 
technologies day in and day out 

02:35:19.231 --> 02:35:23.109
and if you can't find someone to
observe in real life, that's 

02:35:23.110 --> 02:35:25.110
okay.

02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:32.997
You can just go online and look 
for any kind of video.  There 

02:35:32.998 --> 02:35:34.005
are countless great videos 
online to explain the different 

02:35:34.006 --> 02:35:38.931
ways that people use different 
technologies.  The goal here is 

02:35:38.932 --> 02:35:44.647
to understand what makes a good 
versus a poor experience.  What 

02:35:44.648 --> 02:35:46.063
are the common pitfalls and the 
standard expectations that 

02:35:46.064 --> 02:35:49.538
people have when using your site
or app.  

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:55.285
Later using our fictional app 
Crane we'll walk you through 

02:35:55.286 --> 02:35:57.286
designing a great keyboard 
navigation model.

02:36:02.008 --> 02:36:04.446
Starting with the keyboard 
navigation model creates a very 

02:36:04.447 --> 02:36:06.447
good foundation for 

02:36:07.465 --> 02:36:08.556
you when building for other 
assistive technologies which we 

02:36:08.557 --> 02:36:13.657
won't go in to here.  You may be
feeling a bit overwhelmed right 

02:36:13.658 --> 02:36:15.658
now in how to design to meet all
these needs.

02:36:18.541 --> 02:36:19.755
But the great thing about design
inclusively is that people and 

02:36:19.756 --> 02:36:24.093
teams have been working for 
years to understand what design 

02:36:24.094 --> 02:36:26.094
incloousively means.

02:36:29.133 --> 02:36:31.133
Material design

02:36:36.419 --> 02:36:38.419
sign components -- doing the 
right thing 

02:36:39.701 --> 02:36:42.593
though isn't necessarily 
mutually exclusive to good 

02:36:42.594 --> 02:36:44.594
business sense either.

02:36:46.100 --> 02:36:47.936
You can even increase your 
market share.  According to the 

02:36:47.937 --> 02:36:50.387
American institute of research 
who came out with this report a 

02:36:53.435 --> 02:36:54.463
few months ago working age 
people with disabilities in the 

02:36:54.464 --> 02:36:56.464
U.S.

02:36:58.519 --> 02:37:02.474
alone have a discretionary 
income of 21 billion dollars.  

02:37:02.475 --> 02:37:05.942
That's the third largest market 
segment in the entire country.  

02:37:05.943 --> 02:37:10.437
Then if you think about their 
families and friends, who may 

02:37:10.438 --> 02:37:12.865
also use your product to 
interact with them, or, you 

02:37:14.500 --> 02:37:17.346
know, they may just simply 
appreciate good design, and this

02:37:17.347 --> 02:37:19.347
is not just the U.S. alone.

02:37:23.068 --> 02:37:24.301
According to Gartner people with
disabilities and their friends 

02:37:24.302 --> 02:37:26.302
and 

02:37:28.211 --> 02:37:30.211
family worldwide have a 
collective 

02:37:33.146 --> 02:37:35.146
disposable income of 8 trillion 
dollars.

02:37:36.551 --> 02:37:39.664
Think about that.  Okay.  
That was a lot of information.

02:37:43.338 --> 02:37:45.338
So let's go over the important 
points to keep in mind.

02:37:48.478 --> 02:37:49.503
One, talk to people with 
disabilities to inform their 

02:37:49.504 --> 02:37:53.366
product vision.  Two, learn 
assistive technologies from the 

02:37:53.367 --> 02:37:56.037
experts.  And three, build a 
better experience 

02:37:59.293 --> 02:38:02.550
for all users and potentially 
capture more market share.  Now 

02:38:02.551 --> 02:38:04.413
I'm going to hand it over to 
Catherine who is going to go 

02:38:04.414 --> 02:38:08.516
over stage 2, design.  You are 
right here.  

02:38:10.958 --> 02:38:11.158
&gt;&gt; CATHERINE IDYLLE:  Thanks 
Andrea.  

02:38:11.159 --> 02:38:15.068
(Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; CATHERINE IDYLLE:  Hi.

02:38:19.810 --> 02:38:21.264
Now that you have defined your 
product vision it is time to 

02:38:21.265 --> 02:38:23.265
design your app.  You will need 
to think about 

02:38:26.553 --> 02:38:29.029
interaction design, visual 
design, UX writing and motion 

02:38:29.030 --> 02:38:31.030
design but don't worry, we will 
do design challenge 

02:38:34.557 --> 02:38:37.430
together using our fictional app
Crane to learn how to do this.  

02:38:37.431 --> 02:38:42.722
So Crane is a travel and 
hospitality app that lets users 

02:38:42.723 --> 02:38:44.723
book flights and 

02:38:46.837 --> 02:38:49.690
accommodations on a computer or 
phone.  In terms of interaction 

02:38:49.691 --> 02:38:54.385
design, you might be wondering 
how do I even get started 

02:38:54.386 --> 02:38:58.670
designing accessible and useable
experience for everyone.  Well, 

02:38:58.671 --> 02:39:00.671
design as you normally do, have 

02:39:01.978 --> 02:39:03.395
your Wireframes and your 
sketches and get started there. 

02:39:06.669 --> 02:39:08.523
This is a Wireframe of filter 
options on mobile when you 

02:39:08.524 --> 02:39:11.995
search for a flight on Crane.  
Here we can see that the check 

02:39:11.996 --> 02:39:19.128
boxes are aligned with the label
but they are pretty far apart.  

02:39:19.129 --> 02:39:21.778
When designing your layout 
ensure that related content and 

02:39:21.779 --> 02:39:25.702
controls are grouped together.  
This makes it easier to 

02:39:25.703 --> 02:39:27.703
understand and 

02:39:29.106 --> 02:39:33.141
also easier to reach for people 
with motor disabilities.  

02:39:33.142 --> 02:39:35.142
Especially for people with ALS, 
or a traveller on a bumpy train.

02:39:39.499 --> 02:39:42.151
So we did here is that we placed
a check boxes right next to the 

02:39:42.152 --> 02:39:44.152
labels.  It is a better 
experience for everyone.

02:39:47.465 --> 02:39:49.465
In terms of interaction design, 
you 

02:39:53.217 --> 02:39:54.839
can also have a huge impact on 
all users by thinking about the 

02:39:54.840 --> 02:39:57.085
tab interaction model.  Meaning 
a great keyboard experience.

02:40:00.167 --> 02:40:02.637
Here we have a Wireframe on web 
of the flight search results.  

02:40:02.638 --> 02:40:07.348
Tabbing on the keyboard allows 
you to jump from one interactive

02:40:07.349 --> 02:40:09.349
element on the 

02:40:10.465 --> 02:40:13.110
screen as we can see right here.
This will be the default tab 

02:40:15.368 --> 02:40:17.368
experience if we didn't design 
it at all.

02:40:21.100 --> 02:40:23.739
It would take 94 tabs stops to 
go from point A the back button 

02:40:23.740 --> 02:40:28.226
to point B the filter options.  
This is a slow experience.

02:40:32.508 --> 02:40:34.508
So what we can do is actually 
group 

02:40:35.610 --> 02:40:37.610
major elements together, like 
this list of individual flights.

02:40:41.741 --> 02:40:46.447
Now at it only takes 7 tap stops
to reach point B.  And once you 

02:40:46.448 --> 02:40:48.902
have grouped your big tab stops 
together don't forget how to 

02:40:52.167 --> 02:40:54.167
quickly navigate to the smaller 
elements 

02:40:55.677 --> 02:40:57.677
such as the individual flights 
and this big list of flights.

02:41:00.575 --> 02:41:03.446
Here we will go with an upand 
down arrow option to navigate 

02:41:03.447 --> 02:41:05.447
between them.

02:41:07.118 --> 02:41:09.118
Overall this is a much better 
and 

02:41:10.194 --> 02:41:12.194
productive experience for power 
users 

02:41:13.536 --> 02:41:17.424
much like yourselves right here,
and assistive tech users alike. 

02:41:17.425 --> 02:41:22.119
Here is some things that we can 
do to make your app more 

02:41:22.120 --> 02:41:26.462
accessible in terms of 
interaction design.  Group your 

02:41:26.463 --> 02:41:30.756
content, and your controls 
together.  Design your tab 

02:41:30.757 --> 02:41:34.612
interaction model.  And don't 
forget the error navigation as 

02:41:34.613 --> 02:41:36.613
well.

02:41:38.498 --> 02:41:39.103
Now on to Bethany to talk about 
visual design.  

02:41:39.104 --> 02:41:41.104
(Applause.

02:41:42.121 --> 02:41:44.469
) 
   &gt;&gt; BETHANY FONG:  Thanks, 

02:41:44.470 --> 02:41:47.308
Catherine.  So now that we have 
laid a good foundation in terms 

02:41:47.309 --> 02:41:49.309
of interaction 

02:41:51.202 --> 02:41:53.241
design, let's refine our 
visuals.  To start with the very

02:41:53.242 --> 02:41:55.242
basics.

02:41:56.710 --> 02:41:58.710
I am sure you have felt the pain
of 

02:42:00.816 --> 02:42:02.816
light gray text on light gray 
background.  So the No.

02:42:04.483 --> 02:42:06.130
1 way that you can be a hero for
these users is ensuring that 

02:42:06.131 --> 02:42:09.846
color contrast is between your 
foreground and background colors

02:42:09.847 --> 02:42:11.878
is going to be high enough and 
you can use our material color 

02:42:11.879 --> 02:42:16.621
tool pictured here to check the 
ledgibility of your choices and 

02:42:16.622 --> 02:42:18.622
check them against different 
background colors.

02:42:21.525 --> 02:42:23.525
Like the three shades of purple 
here.  So let's apply this.

02:42:28.298 --> 02:42:30.298
Going whack back it our app, 
these 

02:42:31.385 --> 02:42:33.435
faded colors that you see are 
trendy but the contrast is so 

02:42:33.436 --> 02:42:35.888
low that it is hard for even 
most sighted users to have a 

02:42:37.300 --> 02:42:39.356
legible experience here.  And 
remember this is going to be 

02:42:41.490 --> 02:42:43.490
better not just for users with 
low 

02:42:45.138 --> 02:42:47.820
vision, but someone with dilated
eyes after a doctor's 

02:42:47.821 --> 02:42:50.057
appointment or people like 
yourselves out in the sun all 

02:42:50.058 --> 02:42:52.499
day with glare on your screen.  
So let's add more color 

02:42:52.500 --> 02:42:57.011
contrast.   
First we are going to zoom in on

02:42:57.012 --> 02:43:02.443
how we can add contrast in to 
the text field component.  We 

02:43:02.444 --> 02:43:04.283
increase the font weight and 
color darkness in the text 

02:43:04.284 --> 02:43:06.284
fields which makes 

02:43:07.375 --> 02:43:11.861
it easier to scan and ensures a 
better visual hierarchy.  And we

02:43:11.862 --> 02:43:13.102
also increase the background 
color darkness on the button at 

02:43:13.103 --> 02:43:18.438
the bottom.  Making the text 
more legible and making the call

02:43:18.439 --> 02:43:19.869
to action much easier to spot 
which is really important 

02:43:19.870 --> 02:43:23.928
because you are trying to get 
your users to purchase something

02:43:23.929 --> 02:43:27.864
here.  And already with the 
before and after you can see 

02:43:27.865 --> 02:43:29.865
that this is a much better 
design.

02:43:32.998 --> 02:43:34.826
Other than just looking more 
aestheticically pleasing the 

02:43:34.827 --> 02:43:38.108
text is more legible and the 
call to action are a lot easier 

02:43:38.109 --> 02:43:40.109
to spot.  

02:43:43.399 --> 02:43:45.459
So now your user is filling in 
their information in toe these 

02:43:45.460 --> 02:43:49.983
much better text fields and 
getting closer to booking that 

02:43:49.984 --> 02:43:51.984
flight but it looks like 

02:43:53.681 --> 02:43:57.345
they made an error.  However 
some users will color blindness 

02:43:57.346 --> 02:44:00.637
might miss this important piece 
of information.  And this can be

02:44:00.638 --> 02:44:03.094
fixed by supplementing any 
information that's coded in 

02:44:03.095 --> 02:44:05.095
color 

02:44:06.158 --> 02:44:08.393
through other means like icons 
or shapes.  So we are going to 

02:44:08.394 --> 02:44:13.495
check out the material icon site
and search for error icons.  It 

02:44:13.496 --> 02:44:15.496
is good to use essential 
resource 

02:44:17.594 --> 02:44:19.276
like this because thee are 
common visual metaphors that ma 

02:44:19.277 --> 02:44:23.159
may be recognizable to a wide 
variety of users.  It looks like

02:44:23.160 --> 02:44:26.461
we can go ahead and use this 
one.  We are going to download 

02:44:26.462 --> 02:44:28.462
and now there are two ways to 
understand that this is 

02:44:31.369 --> 02:44:33.624
an error state and this makes it
clearer for everyone, not just 

02:44:33.625 --> 02:44:36.686
users who are color blind.  And 
for our last visual design 

02:44:36.687 --> 02:44:39.747
example let's look at focus 
state and element size on 

02:44:39.748 --> 02:44:44.630
screen.  So when users choose a 
seat in this travel app, it is 

02:44:44.631 --> 02:44:48.360
important that they can select 
the seat that they want and that

02:44:48.361 --> 02:44:50.804
they know their selection was 
success ful.

02:44:54.922 --> 02:44:57.769
This means having a touch target
size about 7 millimeters wide 

02:44:57.770 --> 02:45:03.320
which is calibrated against a 
size of adult fingertip.  And on

02:45:03.321 --> 02:45:06.993
web try to ensure that your 
focus is highly visible.  You 

02:45:06.994 --> 02:45:08.994
can see it as the bold purple 

02:45:10.658 --> 02:45:12.658
joult line around seat 8A.

02:45:13.709 --> 02:45:15.565
So when you are doing your 
visual design when keeping it 

02:45:15.566 --> 02:45:20.417
accessible make sure you have 
high color contrast and you have

02:45:20.418 --> 02:45:22.316
multiple visible indicators for 
any important component states 

02:45:22.317 --> 02:45:27.192
and lastly make sure that your 
touch target sizes are going to 

02:45:27.193 --> 02:45:30.668
be large enough for people to 
reach.  Back over to Catherine. 

02:45:30.669 --> 02:45:33.912
   (Applause.) 
   &gt;&gt; CATHERINE IDYLLE:  Thanks,

02:45:33.913 --> 02:45:38.099
Bethany.  I'm back.  With 
writing you have the power to 

02:45:40.975 --> 02:45:43.442
guide all users with accessible 
onscreen text as well as 

02:45:43.443 --> 02:45:46.496
meaningful offscreen text that 
will be verbalized by the screen

02:45:46.497 --> 02:45:48.497
reader.

02:45:49.995 --> 02:45:51.436
A screen reader is software that
sits between you and the 

02:45:51.437 --> 02:45:56.356
application and it works in 
tandem with the chi board.  The 

02:45:56.357 --> 02:45:58.420
keyboard moves the focus and the
screen reader will verbalize 

02:45:58.421 --> 02:46:02.908
whatever has come in to focus.  
We have these example from 

02:46:02.909 --> 02:46:05.147
Google.com if you heard of it 
and it will read 

02:46:09.035 --> 02:46:11.081
this button as Google search 
button because the screen reader

02:46:11.082 --> 02:46:16.224
automatically reads out loud the
label Google search and the 

02:46:16.225 --> 02:46:18.225
control type button.

02:46:19.908 --> 02:46:24.791
So back to our Crane app.  We 
have a checkout screen.  Let's 

02:46:24.792 --> 02:46:27.474
just focus on these four 
buttons.  And remember the 

02:46:27.475 --> 02:46:30.131
screen reader automatically 
reads out loud the control type.

02:46:33.218 --> 02:46:35.218
So it will verbalize these 
buttons as 

02:46:36.703 --> 02:46:38.957
button button button button.  
That's problematic.

02:46:42.038 --> 02:46:44.684
We don't know what the buttons 
will do and the cancel order and

02:46:44.685 --> 02:46:49.589
complete order actions are right
next to each other which could 

02:46:49.590 --> 02:46:51.590
lead to major user error.

02:46:52.641 --> 02:46:54.641
Instead what we can do is add 

02:46:56.351 --> 02:46:58.596
meaningful, and concise 
accessible labels in addition to

02:46:58.597 --> 02:47:00.597
the default button 
verbalization.

02:47:03.263 --> 02:47:05.906
So here we have added previous 
step, checkout progress, cancel 

02:47:05.907 --> 02:47:07.907
order, and checkout order.

02:47:10.185 --> 02:47:12.185
Now we know what each button 
will do 

02:47:14.045 --> 02:47:15.269
and they won't be a major gaff 
of canceling an order rather 

02:47:15.270 --> 02:47:17.270
than 

02:47:18.325 --> 02:47:20.325
completing one and vice versa.  

02:47:21.829 --> 02:47:23.829
You can be a champion for screen
reader 

02:47:25.923 --> 02:47:27.802
users by writing access to your 
labels in addition to the 

02:47:27.803 --> 02:47:29.803
default verbalization 

02:47:31.311 --> 02:47:33.311
provided by screen readers.

02:47:36.586 --> 02:47:38.236
In terms of motion design, have 
your had something important 

02:47:38.237 --> 02:47:42.724
flash before your eyes?  Blink 
and then be gone?  This just 

02:47:42.725 --> 02:47:44.725
happened to you.

02:47:45.783 --> 02:47:47.864
It is a major pain point for 
users of low vision or someone 

02:47:47.865 --> 02:47:49.865
who wasn't paying attention.

02:47:52.751 --> 02:47:53.861
Try to ensure that alerts like 
snack bars are presented on the 

02:47:53.862 --> 02:47:56.532
screen long enough so that 
everyone can see them, like 

02:47:56.533 --> 02:48:02.053
right now.  And have an option 
to easily dismiss them, like a 

02:48:02.054 --> 02:48:04.054
dismiss button or tapping out 
function.

02:48:06.742 --> 02:48:08.742
Likewise consider supporting 
screen magnification users.

02:48:11.022 --> 02:48:12.647
Here on web when a user hovers 
over a seat they get additional 

02:48:12.648 --> 02:48:17.722
information about that seat in a
hover card.  But it covers the 

02:48:17.723 --> 02:48:21.482
rest of the screen when 
magnified.  To help our users 

02:48:21.483 --> 02:48:23.483
get back to whatever 

02:48:25.131 --> 02:48:27.131
they are doing, consider an easy
escape patch.

02:48:30.017 --> 02:48:32.017
Such as escape key shortcut or a
close button.  

02:48:34.563 --> 02:48:36.190
To ensure that your motion 
design accessible present an 

02:48:36.191 --> 02:48:39.677
alerts for long enough and have 
an option to easily dismiss 

02:48:39.678 --> 02:48:41.678
them.

02:48:43.160 --> 02:48:45.160
Likewise, easily escape hover 

02:48:47.794 --> 02:48:49.794
information during screen 
magnification

02:48:51.555 --> 02:48:53.555
.  At this stage we have 
designed the 

02:48:55.838 --> 02:49:00.341
interactive visual, writing, and
motion aspects of our product.  

02:49:00.342 --> 02:49:03.430
Now it is time to talk to users.
Get some feedback and check if 

02:49:03.431 --> 02:49:05.431
you are on the right track.

02:49:10.571 --> 02:49:12.571
Also see if you ran in to any 
major 

02:49:13.680 --> 02:49:15.680
blockers that you didn't 
consider.

02:49:17.148 --> 02:49:20.024
It consists of having a small 
set of examiners evaluate your 

02:49:20.025 --> 02:49:25.175
app.  Otherwise called 
heuristics.  So right here we 

02:49:25.176 --> 02:49:28.118
have three heuristics from the 
material design accessible 

02:49:32.231 --> 02:49:34.892
guidelines and they are clear, 
they are robust and specific.  

02:49:34.893 --> 02:49:36.893
So let's check.

02:49:38.388 --> 02:49:40.388
Is your app clear, meaning are 
its 

02:49:42.476 --> 02:49:46.355
layout noncrowded and calls to 
action visually distinct?  Is 

02:49:46.356 --> 02:49:48.593
your app robust?  Does it 
support a variety of user 

02:49:49.016 --> 02:49:53.309
capabilities.  Finally is your 
app specific?  Does it 

02:49:53.310 --> 02:49:55.955
specifically support a variety 
of user technologies in the ways

02:49:55.956 --> 02:49:57.956
that the user expects?

02:50:01.488 --> 02:50:03.728
Let's try this out with Crane.  
We have two button variations 

02:50:03.729 --> 02:50:05.729
and we 

02:50:06.805 --> 02:50:09.458
want to see if it is clear 
enough for low vision users.

02:50:14.583 --> 02:50:16.583
Well, we may find that these two

02:50:17.848 --> 02:50:19.904
buttons have the same color 
contrast but may also find that 

02:50:19.905 --> 02:50:22.784
people prefer the one on the 
right because the shopping cart 

02:50:28.316 --> 02:50:30.316
icon makes the purpose of the 
button 

02:50:31.323 --> 02:50:37.374
more obvious.  After completing 
your product conduct your 

02:50:37.375 --> 02:50:39.223
heuristic evaluation and feel 
free to use the accessibility 

02:50:39.224 --> 02:50:42.693
guidelines provided by material 
design.  Is your app clear?  

02:50:42.694 --> 02:50:48.011
Robust?  And specific?  
Now back to Bethany on how to 

02:50:48.012 --> 02:50:51.122
develop your app.  
   &gt;&gt; BETHANY FONG:  Thanks 

02:50:51.123 --> 02:50:53.123
Catherine.  
   (Applause.

02:50:54.131 --> 02:50:56.292
) 
   &gt;&gt; BETHANY FONG:  So you have

02:50:56.293 --> 02:50:59.562
moved on to the development 
stage.  And you want to make 

02:50:59.563 --> 02:51:04.261
sure that all of those decisions
you just made in the design 

02:51:04.262 --> 02:51:06.262
stage hold through to the final 
product.  

02:51:08.144 --> 02:51:10.144
So the first thing you can do is
use 

02:51:11.445 --> 02:51:13.070
stand dard components when 
designing.  If you use material 

02:51:13.071 --> 02:51:15.071
components they 

02:51:16.555 --> 02:51:18.595
will be pre vetted and they will
be useable and recognizable to 

02:51:18.596 --> 02:51:20.596
your users.

02:51:22.020 --> 02:51:24.019
If you use something nonstandard
note that you will props have to

02:51:24.020 --> 02:51:28.562
design the full component 
yourself as well as marking it 

02:51:28.563 --> 02:51:30.424
out with the appropriaty 
metadata.  You will need to 

02:51:30.425 --> 02:51:35.550
provide labels, struck is it 
your and paths.  And designers 

02:51:35.551 --> 02:51:38.242
one tool that you can use is 
gallery.  Created by Google to 

02:51:38.243 --> 02:51:40.669
help you manage design 
iterations and get quick design 

02:51:41.104 --> 02:51:46.289
feedback.  If you use our 
material theme editor with 

02:51:46.290 --> 02:51:48.350
sketch which is a popular design
tool and upload your mocks to 

02:51:48.351 --> 02:51:50.397
gallery you will see all 
measurements or red 

02:51:53.884 --> 02:51:56.363
lines as designers call them.  
You can see here how large this 

02:51:56.364 --> 02:52:00.233
price text is and make sure that
the touch target size is going 

02:52:00.234 --> 02:52:02.284
to be large enough to be tapible
for people with hand tremor.

02:52:05.535 --> 02:52:06.746
You can also use it to 
communicate back and forth with 

02:52:06.747 --> 02:52:08.747
your team about 

02:52:10.458 --> 02:52:12.496
accessibility markup and any 
verbalizations.

02:52:15.742 --> 02:52:17.378
Don't forget to use scaleable 
text.  This allows for a piece 

02:52:17.379 --> 02:52:19.616
of text to scale up or down 
according to the user's 

02:52:23.701 --> 02:52:26.366
individual seat settings.  But 
urnl the rest of the UI remains 

02:52:26.968 --> 02:52:31.289
the same size.  So follow this 
specific platform standards for 

02:52:31.290 --> 02:52:33.290
how scaleable text should be 
implemented.

02:52:37.604 --> 02:52:40.676
And here is the same screen with
the large text.  You can 

02:52:40.677 --> 02:52:43.124
actually read it which is great.
Engineers you can keep users 

02:52:43.125 --> 02:52:48.633
with various impairments in mind
as a designer would consider a 

02:52:48.634 --> 02:52:51.273
user with low vision, no vision 
or some mobility challenges.

02:52:54.546 --> 02:52:56.787
One way of focusing this work is
to schedule periodic bug patches

02:52:56.788 --> 02:53:00.697
and fix lets from accessibility 
point of view and a number of 

02:53:00.698 --> 02:53:02.698
tools that you can use during 
development to check your 

02:53:04.407 --> 02:53:06.407
accessibility on web and on 
Android.

02:53:10.089 --> 02:53:11.772
These include accessibility 
scanner on Android because it 

02:53:11.773 --> 02:53:13.773
checks your app 

02:53:15.277 --> 02:53:17.277
screen by screen for any 
accessibility 

02:53:21.587 --> 02:53:23.471
errors and come by the 
accessibility sandbox to learn 

02:53:23.472 --> 02:53:27.385
about other dev tools that you 
can use during your process.  As

02:53:27.386 --> 02:53:29.386
you are developing don't forget 
to 

02:53:31.876 --> 02:53:34.524
use common compon nents when you
can.  Use scaleable text and use

02:53:35.734 --> 02:53:37.734
accessibility development tools 
throughout your process to check

02:53:41.442 --> 02:53:44.719
yourself as you go.  All right. 
   &gt;&gt; JEN DEVINS:  Thanks.

02:53:48.134 --> 02:53:50.060
So now
Dev. 

02:53:50.061 --> 02:53:52.950
&gt;&gt; ANDREA WONG:  Now I'm going 
to talk about the last stage, 

02:53:52.951 --> 02:53:55.204
stage 4 after development.  The 
bulk of development work is 

02:53:56.623 --> 02:53:58.623
complete and you are about to 
launch.

02:54:04.165 --> 02:54:06.595
This -- at this time we 
recommend using a tool like 

02:54:06.596 --> 02:54:09.870
prelaunch report from the Google
Play store.  Some of you may 

02:54:09.871 --> 02:54:11.871
already be using 

02:54:12.909 --> 02:54:13.526
prelaunch report but the good 
news is it now includes 

02:54:13.527 --> 02:54:15.527
accessibility.

02:54:17.789 --> 02:54:20.029
So upload your app to Alpha beta
channel and it will crawl 

02:54:20.030 --> 02:54:22.477
through your app to identify a 
number of ways to improve it.

02:54:26.799 --> 02:54:29.473
Like crashes, latency issues, 
and, of course, accessibility.  

02:54:29.474 --> 02:54:31.474
And you won't need to instrument
your app ahead of time.

02:54:34.970 --> 02:54:36.393
For the web, we recommend 
automated accessibility tools 

02:54:36.394 --> 02:54:38.427
that's built right in to our 
Chrome dev tools.

02:54:42.704 --> 02:54:43.755
So inside the audit's pan nel 
you will see a tool called light

02:54:43.756 --> 02:54:45.756
house.

02:54:46.812 --> 02:54:48.812
Light house will run about 40 

02:54:50.055 --> 02:54:50.823
automated tests against your 
site to check for common 

02:54:50.824 --> 02:54:52.824
accessibility issues.

02:54:56.868 --> 02:54:58.760
When it is finished, it will 
give you a score.  It will point

02:54:58.761 --> 02:55:00.761
out the failing elements 

02:55:02.769 --> 02:55:06.569
and the best part is will link 
you to documentation with 

02:55:02.769 --> 02:55:04.795
instructions on how to fix those
failing elements.  And if you 

02:55:04.796 --> 02:55:06.796
have done everything right up to
this point, you have listened to

02:55:08.802 --> 02:55:10.802
all of us, then everything here 
should be a breeze.  

02:55:13.537 --> 02:55:15.787
One more thing, no great 
onboarding experience is 

02:55:15.788 --> 02:55:17.788
complete without good help 
content.

02:55:19.873 --> 02:55:22.769
And help content is a resource 
that people with disabilities 

02:55:22.770 --> 02:55:24.770
often utilize.

02:55:26.650 --> 02:55:27.675
So make sure you include in help
content on accessibility and 

02:55:27.676 --> 02:55:29.676
make sure 

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:33.579
that content is actual tli 
accessible.  This is a great 

02:55:33.580 --> 02:55:35.621
opportunity to help all users 
get off to a great start with 

02:55:37.869 --> 02:55:40.093
your app or your product.  And 
recover quickly when they get 

02:55:40.708 --> 02:55:42.708
stuck.

02:55:43.810 --> 02:55:48.088
Yay!  You have launched.  Now 
that we are here you are 

02:55:48.089 --> 02:55:52.593
probably going through your 
metrics and Analytics and 

02:55:52.594 --> 02:55:54.594
checking the effectiveness of 
your 

02:55:55.707 --> 02:55:57.707
launch and user engagement and 
so forth.

02:56:01.258 --> 02:56:03.258
You are hopefully also doing 
user 

02:56:05.258 --> 02:56:08.658
studies and measuring 
satisfaction to see how well 

02:56:05.258 --> 02:56:07.307
your app has been received by 
everyone.  At this point include

02:56:07.308 --> 02:56:09.289
respondents with accessibility 
needs so that you are hearing 

02:56:09.290 --> 02:56:11.290
all the feedback.

02:56:12.633 --> 02:56:15.304
This is also the perfect time to
stop and understand what 

02:56:15.305 --> 02:56:17.305
benefits your team 

02:56:19.320 --> 02:56:21.320
has reaped from design

02:56:22.441 --> 02:56:24.441
inclusively from the very 
beginning.

02:56:25.701 --> 02:56:27.746
Decide what to cut and what to 
keep and what to change and 

02:56:27.747 --> 02:56:30.635
apply to the next cycle.  Over 
time design inclusively will 

02:56:32.884 --> 02:56:37.607
become second nature to you.  
Let's go over the main points.  

02:56:37.608 --> 02:56:39.608
One, check the common 
accessibility 

02:56:42.711 --> 02:56:44.562
issues with prelaunch report and
higt light house.  Make sure you

02:56:44.563 --> 02:56:46.563
have accessibility help 

02:56:48.406 --> 02:56:50.941
content that's access accessible
and get feedback from users 

02:56:53.944 --> 02:56:55.944
with with disabilities.  
   &gt;&gt; JEN DEVINS:  All right.

02:56:59.098 --> 02:57:01.755
So there you have it our toolkit
of ideas that hopefully you can 

02:57:01.756 --> 02:57:05.677
apply to your process.  
We know it is a lot of 

02:57:05.678 --> 02:57:08.959
information.  There a lot of 
great resources out there that 

02:57:08.960 --> 02:57:10.960
you can rely on.

02:57:12.453 --> 02:57:14.899
We wanted to leave you with one 
thing you can do during each 

02:57:14.900 --> 02:57:16.900
stage of the 

02:57:18.158 --> 02:57:20.158
process starting today.

02:57:21.617 --> 02:57:23.066
So if you are starting out and 
you are defining your product 

02:57:23.067 --> 02:57:26.121
vision can't stress it enough, 
get out there and talk to users.

02:57:28.356 --> 02:57:30.228
If you are curious of where 
should I find users with 

02:57:30.229 --> 02:57:32.229
disabilities, I don't know 
anyone, there is lots of 

02:57:34.310 --> 02:57:36.138
organizations nationally and 
internationally that you can 

02:57:36.139 --> 02:57:39.192
reach out to and they will often
put you in contact with their 

02:57:39.193 --> 02:57:44.118
members.  And in fact, today in 
the design and accessibility 

02:57:44.119 --> 02:57:46.589
sandbox across the way there are
members from the National 

02:57:48.653 --> 02:57:50.702
Federation of the Blind that are
willing and wanting to give you 

02:57:50.703 --> 02:57:53.795
feedback or just answer your 
questions.   

02:57:56.640 --> 02:57:58.300
If you are in the design stage, 
you probably started working on 

02:57:58.301 --> 02:58:00.301
your 

02:58:01.996 --> 02:58:04.239
interaction workflow model and 
you are thinking about it, have 

02:58:04.240 --> 02:58:06.510
it drafted, before you get too 
far take a step back 

02:58:11.010 --> 02:58:13.061
and think how would a user that 
is using a keyboard go through 

02:58:13.062 --> 02:58:15.515
this interaction model.  This is
a great place to start and you 

02:58:17.750 --> 02:58:20.857
will be very happy you did this 
earlier than later.  

02:58:24.125 --> 02:58:26.125
If you are in a development 
stage, use standard components.

02:58:28.615 --> 02:58:30.243
They have been stress tested and
they are familiar to users which

02:58:30.244 --> 02:58:32.312
is great.  You don't want users 
to have to 

02:58:37.040 --> 02:58:39.507
relearn their app or -- for each
screen.  And finally if you are 

02:58:39.508 --> 02:58:41.508
nearing that 

02:58:44.376 --> 02:58:47.273
finish line, and it is after 
velt after development just as 

02:58:47.274 --> 02:58:51.962
Andrea mentioned we recommend 
that ensure you have accessible 

02:58:51.963 --> 02:58:53.963
onboarding and help 

02:58:55.371 --> 02:58:57.371
content and if it makes sense 
for your 

02:59:02.167 --> 02:59:04.167
app to have act accessibility 
onboarding materials.

02:59:06.114 --> 02:59:08.114
We all have the power and 

02:59:09.359 --> 02:59:11.359
responsibility to remove 
barriers, and 

02:59:13.700 --> 02:59:15.700
empower all users to be 
productive and connected.  

02:59:16.588 --> 02:59:18.588
Thank you so much for your time.
   (Applause.

   &gt;&gt; JEN DEVINS:  If you are 
interested in learning nor r 

02:59:27.888 --> 02:59:29.888
more you can attend the 
accessibility and design sandbox

02:59:30.129 --> 02:59:34.394

03:23:15.762 --> 03:23:17.874
. 
   &gt;&gt; Hello and good morning.  

03:23:17.875 --> 03:23:19.875
Thank you for joining our 
session.  I'm. 

03:23:21.978 --> 03:23:23.850
&gt;&gt; MARK SPATES:  Mark Spates and
I brought a few of my colleagues

03:23:23.851 --> 03:23:27.912
with me.  
   &gt;&gt; I'm Michele Turner. 

03:23:31.158 --> 03:23:32.990
&gt;&gt; I'm David Schairer.  
   &gt;&gt;. 

03:23:32.991 --> 03:23:34.847
&gt;&gt; MARK SPATES:  When whe 
started this project a couple of

03:23:34.848 --> 03:23:36.848
years ago we 

03:23:39.529 --> 03:23:41.529
had a vision and our vision was 
to have 

03:23:42.619 --> 03:23:44.619
the Google Assistant to be the 
center of interaction.

03:23:47.935 --> 03:23:50.393
We selected the word intelligent
for a very specific reason.  We 

03:23:50.394 --> 03:23:52.394
believed that users would demand

03:23:53.449 --> 03:23:55.280
that air assistant in their home
understand the environmental 

03:23:55.281 --> 03:23:57.518
context as well as the device 
capabilities when 

03:24:00.774 --> 03:24:02.774
they start to control these 
devices.

03:24:08.995 --> 03:24:10.434
To achieve this goal last year 
we launched the ability to 

03:24:10.435 --> 03:24:12.435
integrate Smart 

03:24:13.691 --> 03:24:16.122
Home devices using the actions 
on Google platform.  Actions on 

03:24:16.123 --> 03:24:18.609
Google is our platform for 
developers to create experiences

03:24:18.610 --> 03:24:20.610
around 

03:24:22.273 --> 03:24:24.273
education, games and many others
through the Google Assistant.

03:24:26.805 --> 03:24:28.805
When it came the Smart Home one 
thing 

03:24:29.842 --> 03:24:31.071
that we focused on was having a 
seamless easy experience for 

03:24:31.072 --> 03:24:33.095
developers to connect these 
devices to the assistant.

03:24:36.180 --> 03:24:38.831
We also understood that we had 
to allow this contextual 

03:24:38.832 --> 03:24:40.872
understanding that we were 
beaning from the home and 

03:24:44.350 --> 03:24:46.350
devices also to be actcessible 
to our 

03:24:48.278 --> 03:24:49.898
developers and we created the 
home graph.  This is a very 

03:24:49.899 --> 03:24:51.899
simple visual representation of 
the home graph.

03:24:54.477 --> 03:24:55.701
The home graph is the key to 
these intelligence interactions 

03:24:55.702 --> 03:25:00.006
that we have with users.  I will
just walk through it quickly.  

03:25:00.007 --> 03:25:03.280
If you look at it it is broken 
down in to three main parts.  

03:25:03.281 --> 03:25:05.314
The first part is the structure.
Understanding the structure and 

03:25:05.315 --> 03:25:07.315
the 

03:25:09.431 --> 03:25:11.431
name of the structure address 9 
of the 

03:25:13.350 --> 03:25:15.378
structure a, what devices in the
structure.  What's the presence 

03:25:15.379 --> 03:25:17.379
of this structure.

03:25:18.657 --> 03:25:20.657
Then the next thing that we look
at are rooms.

03:25:22.405 --> 03:25:24.238
Rooms are extremely important 
signals when you think about 

03:25:24.239 --> 03:25:27.726
interacting with an assistant.  
Command in the living room 

03:25:27.727 --> 03:25:31.825
versus the kitchen can mean very
different things.  So when you 

03:25:31.826 --> 03:25:33.466
look at the room level we are 
saying what is the name of this 

03:25:33.467 --> 03:25:37.361
room and what devices are in 
this room.  The third and 

03:25:37.362 --> 03:25:40.002
probably one of the most 
important components are 

03:25:40.003 --> 03:25:44.935
devices.  When we look at the 
metadata we want to get from 

03:25:44.936 --> 03:25:46.936
devices it things like 

03:25:48.248 --> 03:25:50.493
names, types, trait, attributes 
and state.  If you combine these

03:25:50.494 --> 03:25:52.494
three elements 

03:25:53.969 --> 03:25:56.807
you start to see how we are 
building our understanding and 

03:25:56.808 --> 03:25:58.808
contextual relevance to help 
users get to the exact control 

03:25:59.936 --> 03:26:01.936
that they want.

03:26:03.041 --> 03:26:06.689
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  So we 
launched this last year.  We 

03:26:06.690 --> 03:26:08.690
have over 400 partners who have 

03:26:10.377 --> 03:26:12.404
used Smart Home API on access on
Google.  We hope that never goes

03:26:12.405 --> 03:26:15.877
up and some of you guys leave to
start to create some of these 

03:26:15.878 --> 03:26:17.878
integrations for us.

03:26:19.776 --> 03:26:22.018
The other cool part is we 
control over 5,000 Smart Home 

03:26:22.019 --> 03:26:24.903
products on the market today.  
So if you walk in to my of your 

03:26:28.373 --> 03:26:29.804
favorite electronic stores or 
sites and look at these Smart 

03:26:29.805 --> 03:26:31.805
Home devices there is a good 
chance that the Google 

03:26:34.929 --> 03:26:36.762
Assistant can actually control 
it.  But we are seeing an 

03:26:36.763 --> 03:26:41.073
evolution.  When we first 
started this I remember talking 

03:26:41.074 --> 03:26:43.737
to David and we are all excited 
that we can *** say turn the 

03:26:43.738 --> 03:26:46.419
light on, turn the light off.  
We are like oh, man we did it.

03:26:49.769 --> 03:26:51.769
We just changed the world.  It 
is our Edison moment.

03:26:54.231 --> 03:26:56.694
That off and on was not enough. 
We wanted to be able to have the

03:26:56.695 --> 03:26:58.955
user speak to the assistant in 
the way that 

03:27:02.228 --> 03:27:04.228
they speak to their partner or 
spouse or children or family.

03:27:05.832 --> 03:27:07.832
Than

03:27:09.399 --> 03:27:11.399
And this evolution a very simple
thing.

03:27:13.102 --> 03:27:15.102
Make it cooler, make it warmer.

03:27:16.420 --> 03:27:18.420
The first step this we took we 
decided 

03:27:20.581 --> 03:27:22.581
to make sure that every single 
device 

03:27:25.489 --> 03:27:27.110
that we support it directly so 
we had a deep understanding of 

03:27:27.111 --> 03:27:30.040
how the device works and what 
are the traits that we need to 

03:27:30.041 --> 03:27:32.088
create so we can match them to 
the grammar that the user will 

03:27:32.089 --> 03:27:36.984
want.  2016 we had a very small 
start.  We had four devices but 

03:27:36.985 --> 03:27:42.127
you can see in 2017 we brought 
so many devices to the market 

03:27:42.128 --> 03:27:43.758
that we support directly and we 
understand with deep knowledge 

03:27:43.759 --> 03:27:45.759
from 

03:27:48.718 --> 03:27:50.718
cameras, doorbells, washers and 
dryers, 

03:27:52.196 --> 03:27:56.266
sensors, air purifiers.  There 
are tons.  All the way to tubs 

03:27:56.267 --> 03:28:01.571
and toilets.  There will be a 
day where you talk to your tub 

03:28:01.572 --> 03:28:03.200
and there is a trait about it.  
And David will tell you about 

03:28:03.201 --> 03:28:05.201
it.

03:28:07.736 --> 03:28:09.736
But let me just walk you through

03:28:11.195 --> 03:28:12.624
quickly, who we using machine 
learning to create a better user

03:28:12.625 --> 03:28:14.685
experience.  This is a very 
simple graph but if you 

03:28:17.754 --> 03:28:19.182
think about this light to the 
user to a five-year-old they 

03:28:19.183 --> 03:28:23.319
have point at it and say mommy 
daddy that's a light.  What we 

03:28:23.320 --> 03:28:25.320
want to understand about that 
light is a little bit different.

03:28:25.570 --> 03:28:27.570
We want to know what's the name 
of that light.

03:28:29.687 --> 03:28:31.687
What traits does it have.

03:28:33.860 --> 03:28:35.860
Does it support color, 
brightness and state.

03:28:38.063 --> 03:28:39.901
Because that allows us to take 
the right action to make the 

03:28:39.902 --> 03:28:43.768
lights in -- dim the lights in 
the living room on make the 

03:28:43.769 --> 03:28:45.769
lights in the living room 
brighter.

03:28:46.846 --> 03:28:48.063
We are going back to that home 
graph and say what's the name of

03:28:48.064 --> 03:28:51.782
that light and where is it 
located and what's the current 

03:28:51.783 --> 03:28:55.267
state and current brightness.  
It is X.  We will raise it by Y.

03:28:57.110 --> 03:28:59.362
This is how we are starting to 
take this data that we are 

03:28:59.363 --> 03:29:01.412
having about the home and 
devices and make it a better 

03:29:02.064 --> 03:29:05.133
user experience.  But it just 
doesn't stop with lights.  

03:29:05.134 --> 03:29:09.862
Lights is easy.  Think about all
the other devices in your home. 

03:29:09.863 --> 03:29:11.863
So you will be able to say hey 
Google 

03:29:13.285 --> 03:29:15.588
raise the tomorrow temperature a
little bit.

03:29:20.575 --> 03:29:23.043
Hey Google dry my clothes or 
start vacuuming.  It is like hey

03:29:23.044 --> 03:29:27.156
clean the house.  But these are 
the type of things that we 

03:29:27.157 --> 03:29:29.157
believe you will start to see 
from 

03:29:30.410 --> 03:29:32.410
the Google Assistant because we 
built 

03:29:33.474 --> 03:29:35.321
this cool Backend with 
contextual understanding and 

03:29:35.322 --> 03:29:37.582
deep understanding of devices.  
So give you more about how as a 

03:29:39.007 --> 03:29:41.667
developer you can take advantage
of this David will walk you 

03:29:41.668 --> 03:29:44.549
through actions on Google.  
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  Thanks.

03:29:48.045 --> 03:29:50.045
We spent the last year E panning
this 

03:29:52.555 --> 03:29:54.555
platform and we launched it a 
year ago on I/O.

03:29:56.251 --> 03:29:58.251
We had maybe a dozen, 20 
partners and 

03:30:02.254 --> 03:30:04.254
now we are 400 partners, 5,000 
devices device products.

03:30:06.522 --> 03:30:07.578
We have also got tens of 
thousands of developers playing 

03:30:07.579 --> 03:30:10.456
with this.  And later we are 
going to talk about how we do 

03:30:10.457 --> 03:30:13.939
that.  I was going to walk 
through a little bit about how 

03:30:13.940 --> 03:30:17.703
this works.  We do have a cloud 
to cloud integration.

03:30:23.832 --> 03:30:25.832
For most of our partners in the 
ooit IoT space.

03:30:27.739 --> 03:30:29.759
It is very easy to take that 
cloud integration and plug it in

03:30:29.760 --> 03:30:31.760
to our lightweight API.

03:30:34.852 --> 03:30:36.852
Most of our partners no greater 
than 

03:30:38.074 --> 03:30:42.064
six weeks that's end to end of 
start of project.  We need to do

03:30:42.065 --> 03:30:44.065
to make sure that everything is 
good to go.

03:30:46.748 --> 03:30:48.790
We have partners that do the 
work in under a day because it 

03:30:48.791 --> 03:30:53.105
is just that easy.  
And as Mark said I will go in to

03:30:53.106 --> 03:30:55.106
a 

03:30:58.136 --> 03:31:00.910
little more detail we use these 
concepts called types and 

03:31:00.911 --> 03:31:02.911
traits.

03:31:07.419 --> 03:31:10.283
This is the pla tonic washing 
machine.  There is a type of 

03:31:10.284 --> 03:31:12.727
device called washing machine.  
It is a type that tells us a 

03:31:12.728 --> 03:31:14.728
little 

03:31:17.848 --> 03:31:20.710
about it and that lets us learn 
that we can call it a washing 

03:31:20.711 --> 03:31:24.396
machine and let it look like a 
washing machine.  It is like a 

03:31:24.397 --> 03:31:26.467
duck in that regard.  But it 
doesn't tell us what that 

03:31:26.874 --> 03:31:29.795
washing machine does.  It has 
its own state, own settings, 

03:31:35.524 --> 03:31:37.524
one of them has a, you know, 
permanent and press mode.

03:31:38.982 --> 03:31:40.982
All of that is where we go to 
traits 

03:31:42.051 --> 03:31:44.051
and we use traits at building 
blocks of 

03:31:45.546 --> 03:31:47.546
this Smart Home and this lets 
partners 

03:31:48.606 --> 03:31:51.077
innovate in their own way in new
-- in new ways which is what we 

03:31:51.078 --> 03:31:53.078
did ot our demo if you go to our
sandbox.

03:31:56.199 --> 03:31:57.626
We have somewhat demo mailbox 
here on stage and show you who 

03:31:57.627 --> 03:32:00.100
you we built this later but this
mailbox and the sandbox 

03:32:04.800 --> 03:32:06.800
no one of our partners has built
a smart 

03:32:07.904 --> 03:32:09.329
mailbox before but we did this 
for the demo because all the 

03:32:09.330 --> 03:32:13.814
traits were there.  Camera, 
light.  On off for the light and

03:32:13.815 --> 03:32:15.815
toggle for 

03:32:17.087 --> 03:32:19.087
the flag and object detection 
for mail 

03:32:20.501 --> 03:32:25.500
based on the ex-sigsisting 
functionality we have.  

03:32:25.501 --> 03:32:27.501
Understands state, understands 
change 

03:32:28.607 --> 03:32:30.464
and as you can well imagine a 
lot of the Google sequence sauce

03:32:30.465 --> 03:32:34.133
and machine learning and 
intelligence starts to operate 

03:32:34.134 --> 03:32:36.604
on the things we learned from 
the home graph we start to be 

03:32:36.605 --> 03:32:41.114
able to take all of these 
devices and actually truly make 

03:32:41.115 --> 03:32:43.759
the Smart Home smart.   

03:32:48.541 --> 03:32:52.265
All of this today you can int 
great with one API.  It is very 

03:32:52.266 --> 03:32:56.550
simple.  You let us query 
devices and execute devices and 

03:32:56.551 --> 03:32:58.551
tell us the devices are there.

03:32:59.639 --> 03:33:01.273
You can call us back at any 
time.  They will push state 

03:33:01.274 --> 03:33:03.946
changes.  Change of device is so
-- that's all you do.

03:33:07.030 --> 03:33:09.307
One little rest full E API.  We 
have a reference and limitations

03:33:09.308 --> 03:33:11.308
we will show you and lots of 
documentation.

03:33:15.853 --> 03:33:18.306
A full team of developer 
relations and support engineers 

03:33:18.307 --> 03:33:21.995
to help you.  You don't need to 
do internationalization.  You 

03:33:21.996 --> 03:33:25.923
don't need to do UI.  Everything
like ha is provided for you.  

03:33:25.924 --> 03:33:27.924
And as can imagine with all of 
the 

03:33:33.080 --> 03:33:35.080
other devices we are going to be
rolling it out.

03:33:36.171 --> 03:33:38.003
So this sort of the status quo 
we are in today.  I am going to 

03:33:38.004 --> 03:33:40.044
turn it back to Michele to talk 
about the fun stuff coming next.

03:33:40.453 --> 03:33:43.927
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  Thanks.  
So as Mark mentioned and David 

03:33:45.348 --> 03:33:47.404
mentioned we have spent the last
couple of years building this 

03:33:47.405 --> 03:33:51.903
platform out.  And now we are in
a state where we are able to add

03:33:51.904 --> 03:33:53.904
a lot of new features to really 
build on the intelligence and 

03:33:56.232 --> 03:33:57.867
help you guys create better and 
more integrated and interactive 

03:33:57.868 --> 03:34:00.141
experiences.  At the end of the 
day what we all want 

03:34:03.595 --> 03:34:05.027
to do is create solutions or to 
problems that people have in 

03:34:05.028 --> 03:34:09.548
their homes.  Things that they 
are going to use every day.  And

03:34:09.549 --> 03:34:11.980
so the fundamental features that
we are adding over the course of

03:34:11.981 --> 03:34:13.981
this 

03:34:15.059 --> 03:34:17.106
year are going to help you do 
that.  There are four main 

03:34:17.107 --> 03:34:19.107
features that we are adding for 
the rest of this year.

03:34:21.812 --> 03:34:24.476
Something called request sync, 
report state, new object 

03:34:24.477 --> 03:34:26.561
detection trait, David is going 
to show you and some new things 

03:34:29.001 --> 03:34:31.001
for entertainment devices.  So 
let's start with request sync.

03:34:34.120 --> 03:34:36.120
Request sync is really very 
simple.

03:34:38.448 --> 03:34:40.448
Right now if I go to the store 
and I 

03:34:41.693 --> 03:34:43.693
go buy another half dozen smart 
lights 

03:34:44.750 --> 03:34:46.423
to go put in my home I have to 
add those devices and they don't

03:34:46.424 --> 03:34:50.747
necessarily -- the fact that I 
have added those devices don't 

03:34:50.748 --> 03:34:52.748
get synced up on to the partner 
app very quickly.

03:34:54.838 --> 03:34:56.838
And so what we are doing with 
request 

03:34:58.348 --> 03:35:00.348
sync is you push the state to 
the Google Cloud to let us know.

03:35:02.427 --> 03:35:05.069
It goes in to home graph.  So I 
go out to the store, I get my 

03:35:05.070 --> 03:35:08.125
new devices and I screw them in.
We bring them -- I pair them up.

03:35:11.388 --> 03:35:13.388
Get them going and they 
automatically just work.

03:35:15.066 --> 03:35:17.942
Today if I did that, I would 
have to unlink and relink and 

03:35:17.943 --> 03:35:21.806
that's a real hassle for most 
users.  We have taken that 

03:35:21.807 --> 03:35:25.938
uncomfortable step out for users
and made it easier for you and 

03:35:25.939 --> 03:35:27.939
made it a lot easier for 
customers.

03:35:29.671 --> 03:35:31.519
One of the painful points is 
just getting started even with 

03:35:31.520 --> 03:35:35.782
things like lights.  So making 
that onboarding process simpler 

03:35:35.783 --> 03:35:37.619
and easier is really important 
and that's part of what request 

03:35:37.620 --> 03:35:39.620
sync does.  

03:35:41.904 --> 03:35:44.972
We have also added a new API for
report state.  Report state is 

03:35:44.973 --> 03:35:48.271
really important.  And it is -- 
I will tell you why it is even 

03:35:48.272 --> 03:35:50.272
more important than ever.  I 
spent a lot of time talking to a

03:35:52.410 --> 03:35:54.875
number of you in the sandbox the
last couple of days about why we

03:35:54.876 --> 03:35:56.876
need report state.

03:35:57.946 --> 03:36:00.594
So imagine a situation where you
go up and you change your therm 

03:36:00.595 --> 03:36:06.142
stat on the wall.  I shift it 
from 65 to 72.  What we normally

03:36:06.143 --> 03:36:09.403
do on the Backend we poll you to
figure out when it this device 

03:36:09.404 --> 03:36:11.404
has been updated.

03:36:12.698 --> 03:36:14.138
But you all saw the new displays
and the new user interfaces for 

03:36:14.139 --> 03:36:18.029
the phone in the keynote.  Well,
now we have new user interfaces 

03:36:20.299 --> 03:36:22.153
on these smart displays and on 
phones that will show the 

03:36:22.154 --> 03:36:24.154
devices.

03:36:25.404 --> 03:36:27.404
And with report state when you 
push 

03:36:28.513 --> 03:36:30.541
report state to us and in to the
home graph we can get that state

03:36:30.542 --> 03:36:33.628
information instantly.  So there
is no cognitive dissidence 

03:36:38.135 --> 03:36:40.135
between I just went over and 
changed my 

03:36:41.613 --> 03:36:44.276
thermostat and my smart display 
is still holding an old state of

03:36:44.277 --> 03:36:46.277
temperature information.  It is 
one of the things that we are 

03:36:47.547 --> 03:36:49.605
starting to require our 
developers to give us so we make

03:36:49.606 --> 03:36:52.859
sure that user experience for 
our consumers is spot on.  

03:36:55.326 --> 03:36:57.774
The other reason you want to urs
report state is so that we are 

03:36:57.775 --> 03:36:59.775
not polling you all the time.

03:37:01.662 --> 03:37:03.102
Which can get annoying and puts 
a lot of load on your server 

03:37:03.103 --> 03:37:05.103
especially if you have very 
active devices.

03:37:07.847 --> 03:37:09.847
In the future report state is 
going to 

03:37:12.889 --> 03:37:15.668
allow us to unlock a lot of I 
will intelligence.  We can work 

03:37:15.669 --> 03:37:17.696
with you tougt to create more 
Intel jenlt experiences.

03:37:21.382 --> 03:37:23.382
Understanding in the kids room 
the 

03:37:25.574 --> 03:37:27.574
light is turned out every night 
at 7:30.

03:37:29.665 --> 03:37:31.480
It is really important now and 
it is going to be really 

03:37:31.481 --> 03:37:33.960
important in the future as we 
start building more and 

03:37:37.030 --> 03:37:39.072
more intelligence.  So the next 
feature I want to talk to 

03:37:42.187 --> 03:37:44.187
you about is object detection.

03:37:46.090 --> 03:37:48.727
This is a trait.  We built in 
trait a few months ago.

03:37:51.802 --> 03:37:53.802
If you are familiar with the 
doorbell 

03:37:55.264 --> 03:37:57.264
you may know this feature.  It 
will actually let you know that 

03:37:58.382 --> 03:37:59.190
someone is at the door.  And we 
did that integration using the 

03:37:59.191 --> 03:38:02.889
new object detection trait.  
Let's take a look.   

03:38:06.716 --> 03:38:08.716
So if we

03:38:10.431 --> 03:38:14.402
See if we can -- 
   &gt;&gt; Someone's at the front 

03:38:14.403 --> 03:38:16.265
door.  
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  If you 

03:38:16.266 --> 03:38:18.266
haven't seen that before, simple
push of the 

03:38:21.582 --> 03:38:23.674
button and it notifies on the 
Google home mini through the 

03:38:23.675 --> 03:38:28.355
assistant.  What's really cool 
about this trait is that it 

03:38:28.356 --> 03:38:30.191
actually changes the model and 
this is one of the things I 

03:38:30.192 --> 03:38:34.265
really want to stress with you 
we are trying to do at Google is

03:38:34.266 --> 03:38:36.720
give you guys the ability to 
create more interesting 

03:38:36.721 --> 03:38:38.721
integrations.

03:38:39.827 --> 03:38:41.658
So with the object detection 
trait normally the assistant 

03:38:41.659 --> 03:38:43.659
controls the device.  You say 
okay, Google, turn on the 

03:38:44.153 --> 03:38:46.153
lights, right?

03:38:47.597 --> 03:38:50.452
With this we take action on a 
device, and it tells the 

03:38:50.453 --> 03:38:53.729
assistant to give a 
notification.  Oops.  I just 

03:38:53.730 --> 03:38:55.970
fired the assistant.  So David 
is going to come up right now 

03:38:57.209 --> 03:38:59.209
and show you a little bit more 
of what 

03:39:00.894 --> 03:39:03.227
you can do with object 
detection.  

03:39:00.894 --> 03:39:02.896
&gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  Cool.  
Thanks.

03:39:07.200 --> 03:39:10.670
So I'm going to do a demo here 
of how notifications work.  

03:39:10.671 --> 03:39:13.350
Object detection is a specific 
case of a general facility we 

03:39:13.351 --> 03:39:15.351
are adding to the 

03:39:16.617 --> 03:39:20.112
Smart Home where partners can 
send notifications on objects.  

03:39:20.113 --> 03:39:22.759
And notifications become another
aspect of objects and devices 

03:39:22.760 --> 03:39:27.505
that you push in to the home 
graph just like traits and 

03:39:27.506 --> 03:39:29.506
attributes and states and 

03:39:31.170 --> 03:39:34.290
commands and so forth other 
aspects of devices.  And this 

03:39:34.291 --> 03:39:36.291
case notifications attach to 
traits.

03:39:38.418 --> 03:39:40.862
So just like in Java where you 
have an object and the object 

03:39:40.863 --> 03:39:43.146
might see messages but might 
declare, we declare a trait 

03:39:46.633 --> 03:39:49.478
you can -- you also are saying 
hey this, for example, this 

03:39:49.479 --> 03:39:51.479
washing machine supports run 
cycle.

03:39:54.556 --> 03:39:55.569
Therefore it can now 
send/receive depending on your 

03:39:55.570 --> 03:39:57.605
perspective notifications of 
cycle errors.

03:40:00.672 --> 03:40:04.358
The other washing machine failed
during the rinse cycle.  We 

03:40:04.359 --> 03:40:06.359
built this object detection as 
the first case of this.

03:40:09.118 --> 03:40:11.159
And like the video showed we 
built it first use cases 

03:40:11.160 --> 03:40:13.160
doorbells but we build these 
things as general cases, the 

03:40:16.482 --> 03:40:18.482
example in the lab in the 
sandbox is for 

03:40:20.538 --> 03:40:21.304
mail detection and here we are 
going to build something a 

03:40:21.305 --> 03:40:23.305
little more interesting.

03:40:25.280 --> 03:40:27.464
But we are going to show you how
-- go back.  Register Smart Home

03:40:27.465 --> 03:40:29.465
project and show 

03:40:30.938 --> 03:40:33.384
how linking works and show how 
you can deploy your cloud 

03:40:33.385 --> 03:40:38.294
service and how notifications 
are sent through in case no Jes 

03:40:38.295 --> 03:40:40.753
in Firebase from the device 
itself and finally show you some

03:40:40.754 --> 03:40:44.835
code and debugging tools.  This 
is basically the flow of this 

03:40:45.045 --> 03:40:47.045
demo.

03:40:49.554 --> 03:40:51.554
So this is a smart mailbox.

03:40:55.285 --> 03:40:57.285
But it has very smart raspberry 
pie down there.

03:41:00.412 --> 03:41:01.618
And again not a shift in product
but easy demo that you can build

03:41:01.619 --> 03:41:03.619
something like.

03:41:04.692 --> 03:41:05.718
This the mailbox has a cloud 
service that we have on 

03:41:05.719 --> 03:41:07.719
Firebase.

03:41:09.223 --> 03:41:11.223
It sends a notification.

03:41:12.704 --> 03:41:14.758
In this case it is a get request
with payload.  This sends to our

03:41:14.759 --> 03:41:17.219
cloud service and cloud service 
is where the smarts are.

03:41:20.690 --> 03:41:23.958
Cloud service is also part of 
our API it.  It sends 

03:41:23.959 --> 03:41:26.622
notification and notification 
then goes in to the home -- goes

03:41:28.272 --> 03:41:29.737
directly to the Google home I 
have up here and you will see 

03:41:29.738 --> 03:41:32.636
that demo.  And all of this is 
driven by the fact 

03:41:35.913 --> 03:41:37.913
that initially, initially the 
mailbox 

03:41:39.248 --> 03:41:41.248
and other devices were synced 
from the 

03:41:42.508 --> 03:41:44.354
partner service to the assistant
for my demo user and therefore 

03:41:44.355 --> 03:41:46.355
in the home 

03:41:47.654 --> 03:41:48.712
graph we know that this device 
supports actually technically it

03:41:48.713 --> 03:41:53.660
supports everything that the one
in the sandbox does that the 

03:41:53.661 --> 03:41:55.661
flag the lights, the 

03:41:57.335 --> 03:41:59.335
camera and so forth there is no 
camera 

03:42:01.220 --> 03:42:03.220
in here but all the traits are 
here.

03:42:05.387 --> 03:42:07.387
I am going to hop on over to the
-- to 

03:42:08.460 --> 03:42:12.732
the laptop screen here.  Which, 
of course, locked on me.  And 

03:42:12.733 --> 03:42:14.733
great.

03:42:16.079 --> 03:42:18.079
So some of you saw this last 
year.

03:42:21.618 --> 03:42:23.678
We have re built this quite a 
bit.  You need no command line 

03:42:23.679 --> 03:42:25.679
functionality for this now.

03:42:28.964 --> 03:42:33.097
Those of us like me that missed 
the command line are a little 

03:42:28.964 --> 03:42:30.964
sad.

03:42:33.643 --> 03:42:37.618
But for the vast majority of 
people -- no G actions.  This is

03:42:37.619 --> 03:42:39.661
much more anyway native for us. 
I am going to walk through a 

03:42:39.662 --> 03:42:42.106
very simple example and I am 
short on time.

03:42:46.162 --> 03:42:48.004
Of how you build a Smart Home 
project today.  So I'm going to 

03:42:48.005 --> 03:42:51.107
add a project.  Now if you are 
doing this, you pick a project 

03:42:51.108 --> 03:42:55.049
name.  Recommendation protip 
from what we have dealt with 

03:42:55.050 --> 03:42:58.538
partners, pick a name that makes
sense.  No longer auto picking 

03:42:58.539 --> 03:43:02.854
names for you.  So you don't get
something like purple chaos 

03:43:02.855 --> 03:43:04.855
giraffes.  Pick a name.

03:43:08.380 --> 03:43:14.966
So that said let's call this 
purple chaos giraffe.  And that 

03:43:14.967 --> 03:43:17.636
creates spin spin spin.  Very 
slow.  Because I am on stage and

03:43:17.637 --> 03:43:19.637
it knows I am on stage.

03:43:22.738 --> 03:43:25.382
This is creating a project in 
the Google console with my 

03:43:25.383 --> 03:43:27.383
Google account up here.

03:43:29.643 --> 03:43:32.423
And -- now I have all these 
things.  This is the full 

03:43:32.424 --> 03:43:34.424
actions on Google.

03:43:36.305 --> 03:43:38.305
So I can build a shopper app or 
I 

03:43:40.760 --> 03:43:41.939
could build quote of the day 
app.  All of those are using 

03:43:41.940 --> 03:43:43.940
conversational 

03:43:45.769 --> 03:43:49.902
actions but for Smart Home we 
are really recommending and very

03:43:45.769 --> 03:43:48.568
strongly recommending that you 
are using these APIs.  Because 

03:43:48.569 --> 03:43:50.635
this is what give us home graph 
and notifications and full 

03:43:52.296 --> 03:43:55.352
understanding the setup is in 
fact, very quick.  So get up and

03:43:55.353 --> 03:43:57.353
running this is going to take 
only a couple of minutes.

03:43:59.413 --> 03:44:01.476
I am going to name this 
something random.

03:44:06.100 --> 03:44:08.100
And I will then

03:44:12.716 --> 03:44:14.783
-- and forgive me network is 
especially slow today.  Account 

03:44:14.784 --> 03:44:16.784
linking.

03:44:17.847 --> 03:44:19.847
Many of you have done this 
already.

03:44:21.957 --> 03:44:25.900
Mechanism for account linking.  
This is pretty standard OLF.  

03:44:25.901 --> 03:44:28.550
Nothing out of the ordinary 
here.  I'm going to make some 

03:44:28.551 --> 03:44:30.551
keyboard mash keys.

03:44:32.976 --> 03:44:34.976
Do not use these keys at home

03:44:36.583 --> 03:44:39.859
.  And, of course -- that is 
protected by RFC.  Did you know 

03:44:39.860 --> 03:44:42.141
there is an actual RFC projected
example.com.

03:44:45.772 --> 03:44:47.772
It is real

03:44:50.876 --> 03:44:52.876
.  Testing is awesome

03:44:59.608 --> 03:45:01.656
.  At this point we are pretty 
much set up.  We are going to 

03:45:01.657 --> 03:45:03.657
create an action.

03:45:05.158 --> 03:45:07.614
I need one thing.  I need the 
end point for an action.

03:45:10.682 --> 03:45:12.682
I am not going to set this one 
up.

03:45:13.730 --> 03:45:15.560
At this point I have now 
deployed this and this will show

03:45:15.561 --> 03:45:18.476
up on my phone.  I'm -- I have 
now deployed this and it 

03:45:21.732 --> 03:45:23.990
will show up on my phone.  And 
it will complain because I I 

03:45:23.991 --> 03:45:27.852
don't have that URL set up.  But
this is now set up on my phone 

03:45:27.853 --> 03:45:31.348
and it will be available in a 
second to show that.  But 

03:45:31.349 --> 03:45:33.349
instead I'm going to switch back

03:45:35.616 --> 03:45:37.680
over here to my stage demo fro 
project.  This is the one that 

03:45:37.681 --> 03:45:40.325
we are actually using and here I
have got the actions set up.

03:45:44.645 --> 03:45:46.645
It is pointed at a Firebase app.

03:45:48.756 --> 03:45:50.756
And the Firebase app here is -- 
I'm 

03:45:52.035 --> 03:45:54.035
going to show you the Firebase 
app.

03:45:55.938 --> 03:45:57.984
You can debloi -- we get asked 
this question a lot do I need 

03:45:57.985 --> 03:46:00.632
use Google Cloud, do I need to 
use thread.

03:46:03.669 --> 03:46:05.669
Google has -- as Google always 
does a 

03:46:07.351 --> 03:46:09.487
number of technologies that you 
can use to be a completely full 

03:46:09.488 --> 03:46:11.751
stack Google developer and if 
you want to do that that's 

03:46:11.752 --> 03:46:13.752
awesome.

03:46:14.860 --> 03:46:17.103
Tu a completely and totally not 
required.  If you have an 

03:46:17.104 --> 03:46:19.776
existing cloud you can keep it. 
You can greant this with any 

03:46:20.397 --> 03:46:22.397
infrastructure that you want.

03:46:27.161 --> 03:46:29.161
You just need Internet decent 
security 

03:46:33.089 --> 03:46:35.964
and int great lightweight API.  
You can see to actually do all 

03:46:35.965 --> 03:46:37.965
the triggering and you can see 
our trigger 

03:46:39.974 --> 03:46:41.974
types

03:46:50.147 --> 03:46:52.992
here so on and so forth.  The 
actual representation of the 

03:46:54.003 --> 03:46:56.003
commands that we run this thug.

03:46:57.722 --> 03:46:59.791
through.  I am going to show you
a little code.

03:47:03.936 --> 03:47:05.936
We have this implemented as a no
JS application.

03:47:10.305 --> 03:47:14.105
This application is a slight 
variant.  One that's in the 

03:47:10.305 --> 03:47:14.583
Codelab.  If you go over to the 
Codelabs there is a Smart Home 

03:47:14.584 --> 03:47:17.041
Codelab that's building a 
washing machine.  It is very 

03:47:17.042 --> 03:47:22.656
much this code.  There is -- 
this is also on github.  So you 

03:47:22.657 --> 03:47:24.080
can play with this yourself and 
use this if you want as a 

03:47:24.081 --> 03:47:26.081
reference to limitation.

03:47:27.571 --> 03:47:29.571
This is not a full -- you would 
want 

03:47:31.510 --> 03:47:34.375
want to use this it is for IoT 
product in market.  It doesn't 

03:47:34.376 --> 03:47:37.263
have a lot of the user 
(inaudible) that you will want 

03:47:37.264 --> 03:47:40.113
for obviously one product.  But 
it does a full reference and 

03:47:41.934 --> 03:47:44.396
limitation including a lot of 
traits here.  And so just to 

03:47:44.397 --> 03:47:46.397
show you a little bit 

03:47:47.888 --> 03:47:50.792
what we are going to demo here 
is primarily object detection 

03:47:50.793 --> 03:47:53.231
like Michele said but instead of
doing mail because 

03:47:56.524 --> 03:47:58.601
these things are extensible I am
going to show you how you might 

03:47:58.602 --> 03:48:03.551
build a product that deteks.  We
have some other needs for this 

03:48:03.552 --> 03:48:05.552
sort of thing.

03:48:07.450 --> 03:48:09.450
But first let me show you how 
you declare this.

03:48:11.744 --> 03:48:13.744
So we have a sync handler:  It 
is 

03:48:14.840 --> 03:48:16.840
basically just -- this is no JS.

03:48:17.863 --> 03:48:20.534
Building the payload and that's 
uninteresting.  The device list 

03:48:20.535 --> 03:48:23.185
here and the reference is 
building devices.  So this is a 

03:48:23.186 --> 03:48:27.510
fixed list.  Your run this and 
because there is no database it 

03:48:27.511 --> 03:48:32.455
defines a number of objects for 
you.  You can use for tests.  So

03:48:32.456 --> 03:48:34.456
here is, for example, a washing 
machine as I was saying.

03:48:36.152 --> 03:48:38.152
This washing machine implements 
on off 

03:48:40.677 --> 03:48:42.677
and start stop and going to have
modes 

03:48:45.443 --> 03:48:47.443
for permanent press and hot, 
cold, and 

03:48:48.518 --> 03:48:50.604
toggles for quiet mode and 
bleach mode and it has a sensor 

03:48:50.605 --> 03:48:52.605
built in and then we 

03:48:57.279 --> 03:48:59.279
built down here somewhere a 
mailbox

03:49:00.989 --> 03:49:06.406
.  Hmmm.  A mailbox.  Of course,
it is the next one.  Here you 

03:49:06.407 --> 03:49:08.632
can see, these are all the 
traits that we have used 

03:49:08.633 --> 03:49:13.016
including outgoing mail toggle 
here is a little -- is this a 

03:49:13.017 --> 03:49:15.017
toggle.  We have a special code 
for.

03:49:18.557 --> 03:49:20.557
Because you have to do atributs 
for toggle.

03:49:22.463 --> 03:49:24.077
This is the things sensor and 
flag and detection and see all 

03:49:24.078 --> 03:49:26.078
of these in action 

03:49:27.334 --> 03:49:29.152
go to the sandbox where the 
camera is working and the flag 

03:49:29.153 --> 03:49:31.153
is working and with 

03:49:32.161 --> 03:49:34.161
that

03:49:35.319 --> 03:49:37.319
let me show you the 
notification.

03:49:38.443 --> 03:49:40.443
Notification in this case again 
no JS very simple.

03:49:41.898 --> 03:49:43.898
It is taking a pass from the 
payload, 

03:49:45.362 --> 03:49:47.362
from an HTPN point and box calls
our 

03:49:48.458 --> 03:49:50.458
implementation in Firebase and 
it simply 

03:49:53.175 --> 03:49:55.175
then has hack line it simply 
sends this 

03:49:56.803 --> 03:50:01.974
notification back through -- 
where is it?  The report state. 

03:50:01.975 --> 03:50:03.975
Report state and notifications 
use the same call.

03:50:06.086 --> 03:50:08.565
This uses a Java web token to 
call us at any time.  It is how 

03:50:08.566 --> 03:50:10.566
you do sync and state 

03:50:12.275 --> 03:50:12.693
reporting and how you do 
noteifications.  This is 

03:50:12.694 --> 03:50:14.694
running.

03:50:16.412 --> 03:50:18.412
It is running in Firebase.

03:50:20.082 --> 03:50:22.958
If you can switch to my phone 
for a second I am going -- I 

03:50:22.959 --> 03:50:25.433
have already set this up.  I 
have already connected to this 

03:50:25.434 --> 03:50:29.541
agent.  I have all the virtual 
devices which of the devices in 

03:50:29.542 --> 03:50:35.069
the sandbox but I have got the 
mailbox here.  Action no 

03:50:35.070 --> 03:50:37.070
commands on the mailbox but 

03:50:38.141 --> 03:50:40.141
I want to show you object 
detection.

03:50:42.224 --> 03:50:44.111
Object detection in this case, 
implemented instead of doing 

03:50:44.112 --> 03:50:49.219
mail we implemented animal 
detection because object 

03:50:49.220 --> 03:50:51.867
detection can detect anything.  
This was supposed to be 

03:50:51.868 --> 03:50:56.824
originally a live demo.  Live 
animal demo but our lawyers said

03:51:00.926 --> 03:51:02.926
no, that was a liability and I 
was being 

03:51:04.756 --> 03:51:06.998
grossly irresponsible.  So this 
is no longer a live animal demo 

03:51:06.999 --> 03:51:10.955
but could I get the mic turned 
on the Google home.  Thanks.  So

03:51:10.956 --> 03:51:12.956
not a live animal demo.

03:51:14.562 --> 03:51:16.562
But if all works well 

03:51:18.699 --> 03:51:20.699
(Laughter)

03:51:25.730 --> 03:51:27.730
. 
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  

03:51:29.805 --> 03:51:31.229
&gt;&gt; There a raccoon in the 
mailbox 

03:51:31.230 --> 03:51:32.462
(Laughter). 
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  Kind of a

03:51:32.463 --> 03:51:34.463
lame -- 
   (Applause.

03:51:35.475 --> 03:51:38.598
) 
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  Kind of a

03:51:38.599 --> 03:51:40.599
lame demo.

03:51:42.315 --> 03:51:44.315
We are reusing the detection 
logic for 

03:51:45.998 --> 03:51:47.998
mail and it is a little harder 
on buzzy animals.

03:51:49.060 --> 03:51:51.060
So it is a little tricky there.

03:51:52.973 --> 03:51:54.973
You can see with the nest facial
which 

03:51:56.438 --> 03:51:58.065
to be fair is many, many more 
thousands of engineering hours 

03:51:58.066 --> 03:52:00.759
of time but you can see you as 
an IoT partner can do what you 

03:52:00.760 --> 03:52:04.849
do best.  You build a cool 
device and we will handle all 

03:52:04.850 --> 03:52:08.908
the grammar and understanding, 
notifications which go to now 

03:52:08.909 --> 03:52:10.909
you have access to the ecosystem
in the house.

03:52:14.467 --> 03:52:16.467
You don't have to send messages 
to 

03:52:18.981 --> 03:52:20.981
phones and we will see over the 
coming 

03:52:22.687 --> 03:52:23.699
weeks and months we will be 
adding notifications of a lot of

03:52:23.700 --> 03:52:26.568
different types for security 
events safety events 

03:52:29.581 --> 03:52:32.804
other notification.  You can 
imagine when the oven timer is 

03:52:34.853 --> 03:52:36.853
going off and you want to know 
that the roast is done.

03:52:39.180 --> 03:52:42.245
You can now be two way in to the
smarter ecosystem.  And those 

03:52:42.246 --> 03:52:45.083
are things that will be rolling 
out over the next coming months.

03:52:47.950 --> 03:52:49.950
Minus the raccoon is in get -- 
in the sandbox.

03:52:52.840 --> 03:52:54.668
You can do this with all off 
your ecosystems.  This is on 

03:52:54.669 --> 03:52:58.324
Firebase.  Run on your own 
cloud.  I know some other 

03:52:58.325 --> 03:53:00.325
companies out there ha have 
clouds but you can run it 

03:53:04.454 --> 03:53:06.512
whoever you like on your 
existing infrastructure.  You 

03:53:06.513 --> 03:53:08.355
can run anything you want in 
your client.  We do have Android

03:53:08.356 --> 03:53:10.356
things that you 

03:53:11.435 --> 03:53:13.435
should in this go and see the 
Android things.

03:53:14.928 --> 03:53:17.208
Sandbox very cool stuff.  We 
have some cool projects that you

03:53:19.031 --> 03:53:21.075
can integrate Android things.  
We will be doing a lot more of 

03:53:21.076 --> 03:53:24.128
that.  Someone just showed me 
this walk through, this is 

03:53:24.129 --> 03:53:26.129
actually last year.

03:53:27.188 --> 03:53:29.188
But this walk through you can 
find by 

03:53:30.671 --> 03:53:33.534
searching home automation and 
Android things someone did an 

03:53:33.535 --> 03:53:37.007
easy walk through of Android 
things running with the API and 

03:53:37.008 --> 03:53:39.008
you can do that walk through.

03:53:41.317 --> 03:53:43.578
We also have -- we also have 
several open source projects 

03:53:43.579 --> 03:53:45.579
natively integrated today.

03:53:51.233 --> 03:53:54.958
So over here we have home 
assistant somewhere.  Home 

03:53:54.959 --> 03:53:56.959
assistant right there in the 

03:53:58.343 --> 03:54:00.602
middle and we have open hab 
which are both right there in 

03:54:00.603 --> 03:54:02.687
the middle which are open source
platforms that are already 

03:54:02.688 --> 03:54:04.688
integrated.

03:54:06.067 --> 03:54:08.984
If you want to play with Smart 
Home devices and don't want to 

03:54:08.985 --> 03:54:13.701
implement these home APIs. Th 
last thing I wanted to show is 

03:54:13.702 --> 03:54:15.702
is a 

03:54:17.612 --> 03:54:19.648
developer tool, extensively in 
the the last six months is we 

03:54:19.649 --> 03:54:21.649
are done a lot 

03:54:23.158 --> 03:54:25.224
more work to int great developer
tools in to the Google ecosystem

03:54:25.225 --> 03:54:27.225
for Smart Home.

03:54:31.092 --> 03:54:33.602
Switch back to the laptop.  
Thank you.  So this here is hard

03:54:33.603 --> 03:54:35.603
to read.

03:54:37.506 --> 03:54:40.605
I apologize is the Stackdriver 
for this account.  So here is 

03:54:40.606 --> 03:54:42.606
the I/O stage.  I have logged in
and all the errors 

03:54:45.699 --> 03:54:48.161
that we see on our side and I 
had to generate some yesterday 

03:54:48.162 --> 03:54:50.162
to get this.

03:54:52.523 --> 03:54:54.359
But last week all of these 
errors are things that you would

03:54:54.360 --> 03:54:56.360
not see because 

03:54:57.818 --> 03:54:59.849
they are outside of you 
ecosystem.  We make a call to 

03:54:59.850 --> 03:55:01.850
the mailbox and the 

03:55:02.912 --> 03:55:04.551
mailbox fails but if Open Office
failing if sync data is wrong, 

03:55:04.552 --> 03:55:06.986
if the notification that you 
send can't be 

03:55:11.332 --> 03:55:12.967
delivered after you have given 
it to us.  So they are now going

03:55:12.968 --> 03:55:17.050
in to stack driver and integrate
this with service and you can 

03:55:17.051 --> 03:55:19.118
Pub/Sub from Stackdriver.  If 
you have another logging service

03:55:22.634 --> 03:55:25.322
you can subscribe to your stack 
level alerts and all of that is 

03:55:25.323 --> 03:55:27.323
now available and highly 
recommended and makes the 

03:55:30.423 --> 03:55:32.423
development process much easier.

03:55:35.139 --> 03:55:37.139
Please visit our -- visit the 
Android 

03:55:38.617 --> 03:55:40.617
-- the Smart Home sand box.

03:55:42.881 --> 03:55:44.881
We have lots of more demos like 
this there.  Talk to us.

03:55:50.262 --> 03:55:54.276
We have our development team 
ready to support developers.  We

03:55:54.277 --> 03:55:58.143
have folks answer questions 
online.  We have other events 

03:55:54.277 --> 03:55:56.277
like this.

03:55:57.492 --> 03:55:58.346
And throw us your questions of 
we have a dedicated team of 

03:55:58.347 --> 03:56:02.985
folks just building new traits. 
New device support every day.  

03:56:02.986 --> 03:56:05.671
We have a lot of stuff that is 
available but not yet on the 

03:56:05.672 --> 03:56:07.715
public website.  If you see 
something that you want, it is 

03:56:07.716 --> 03:56:10.780
not there.  Talk to us.  It is 
probably something that we 

03:56:11.393 --> 03:56:13.393
already built.  So talk to us.

03:56:15.288 --> 03:56:15.891
And with that I will turn it 
back to Michele for one more 

03:56:15.892 --> 03:56:17.892
time.

03:56:19.000 --> 03:56:23.160
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  Thanks.  
That was awesome.  Does the 

03:56:23.161 --> 03:56:26.661
raccoon have a name?  
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  His name 

03:56:26.662 --> 03:56:28.088
is Craig.  
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  Craig?  

03:56:28.089 --> 03:56:30.535
   &gt;&gt; DAVID SCHAIRER:  We spent 
significant time on this 

03:56:30.536 --> 03:56:30.939
yesterday.  
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  

03:56:30.940 --> 03:56:35.455
Excellent.  I will get the back 
story later.  We do have one 

03:56:35.456 --> 03:56:38.104
more thing.  So we are 
announcing here that we are 

03:56:42.587 --> 03:56:44.045
also opening up new APIs for 
control of entertainment 

03:56:44.046 --> 03:56:47.112
devices.  And if you have been 
to the sandz box you probably 

03:56:47.113 --> 03:56:49.113
seen the demo that we have 

03:56:50.993 --> 03:56:51.605
in the booth of the hopper box 
that's currently working in 

03:56:51.606 --> 03:56:53.676
there.  That's our first 
implementation and 

03:56:58.022 --> 03:56:59.879
will be launching in a few 
weeks.  We will take a quick 

03:56:59.880 --> 03:57:01.880
look. 

03:57:05.587 --> 03:57:07.587
&gt;&gt; Switch to HGTV on the hopper

03:57:10.147 --> 03:57:10.959
.  
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  So there 

03:57:10.960 --> 03:57:12.960
we go.

03:57:14.040 --> 03:57:16.040
It is switched to HGTV. 

03:57:19.690 --> 03:57:21.690
&gt;&gt; Switch to ESPN on the hopper

03:57:25.930 --> 03:57:27.161
.  
   &gt;&gt; MICHELE TURNER:  By the 

03:57:27.162 --> 03:57:29.162
way that's 

03:57:31.296 --> 03:57:32.946
Mark's and my cool little setup 
in the office of the mini Smart 

03:57:32.947 --> 03:57:34.947
Home.

03:57:36.165 --> 03:57:38.165
So these

03:57:43.205 --> 03:57:45.656
media or entertainment devices, 
like the one in my living room 

03:57:45.657 --> 03:57:50.194
that's a smart TV that has no 
Voice interface or no mic, no 

03:57:50.195 --> 03:57:53.075
speaker, what we want to be able
to do is light up the assistant 

03:57:53.076 --> 03:57:57.775
to make home control easier for 
those types of devices.  So what

03:57:57.776 --> 03:58:00.023
we have done is we have 
announced a set of traits and 

03:58:00.024 --> 03:58:03.486
this is a list of traits we 
have.  Specific to entertainment

03:58:03.487 --> 03:58:07.796
devices.  We have transport 
control.  Gives you the ability 

03:58:07.797 --> 03:58:10.852
to move the media, rewind.  Fast
forward, et cetera.

03:58:14.189 --> 03:58:16.691
Change the volume up and down 
and get the state of the media 

03:58:16.692 --> 03:58:20.860
and do recording, understand 
what channel you are on.  Mark 

03:58:20.861 --> 03:58:23.507
switching to the channels of we 
played a lot of ESPN yesterday 

03:58:23.508 --> 03:58:25.508
and in 

03:58:26.561 --> 03:58:28.561
some cases we are also doing 
media 

03:58:30.648 --> 03:58:32.076
initiation and this is by early 
access partner only.  If you 

03:58:32.077 --> 03:58:34.304
happen to be at a company that's
doing entertainment devices 

03:58:35.943 --> 03:58:38.599
please come talk to us.  We will
be in the sandbox and happy to 

03:58:40.897 --> 03:58:42.897
talk to you more about this.

03:58:44.579 --> 03:58:46.579
One other thing that I wanted 
that I 

03:58:47.606 --> 03:58:49.606
mention

03:58:51.804 --> 03:58:54.504
ed to mention, we have number of
surfaces in which your smart 

03:58:54.505 --> 03:58:57.784
devices will be shown.  Not only
through Voice control on a 

03:59:00.235 --> 03:59:02.671
variety of speakers but now on 
the phone you will have the 

03:59:02.672 --> 03:59:05.122
newest assistant app that will 
show the status of your smart 

03:59:07.154 --> 03:59:09.836
device on the phone and also on 
all of the new intelligent 

03:59:09.837 --> 03:59:12.086
displays.  So multiple surfaces 
for your smart 

03:59:15.566 --> 03:59:19.842
device to be displayed on and 
interacted with.  So Mark 

03:59:19.843 --> 03:59:21.843
mentioned this earlier, that 

03:59:24.148 --> 03:59:26.394
we are up to 400 partners and 
over 5,000 devices of these are 

03:59:26.395 --> 03:59:28.395
just some of the 

03:59:29.888 --> 03:59:32.142
partners that we have launched 
since CES which was in January. 

03:59:32.143 --> 03:59:34.143
So we are growing very fast.

03:59:36.235 --> 03:59:38.235
We have added new partners like 
LG, 

03:59:42.686 --> 03:59:46.857
dish, Hisense, Panasonic, 
Xiaomi.  If you are thinking 

03:59:46.858 --> 03:59:49.735
about getting started in Smart 
Home come talk to us.

03:59:55.067 --> 03:59:57.067
As David mention ed we in the 
Google 

03:59:59.756 --> 04:00:04.443
assistant sandbox.  We have a 
Codelab and try it out yourself 

04:00:04.444 --> 04:00:06.274
and get your base can project up
and going.  If you are a 

04:00:06.275 --> 04:00:08.275
developer with us Smart Home and
want to understand more about 

04:00:10.199 --> 04:00:13.514
report state we have got a 
Codelab on that as well.  And we

04:00:13.515 --> 04:00:16.594
will be hanging out in the 
sandbox after this.  So please 

04:00:16.595 --> 04:00:18.428
come and talk to us.  Thanks 
very much.  

04:00:18.429 --> 04:00:20.429
(Applause.

04:00:21.442 --> 04:00:23.442
)

04:00:30.131 --> 04:00:31.987
&gt;&gt; Thank you for joining this 
session.  We will be making room

04:00:31.988 --> 04:00:35.046
for those who have registered 
for the next session.  If you 

04:00:35.047 --> 04:00:37.495
have registered for the next 
session in this room, we ask 

04:00:37.496 --> 04:00:40.998
that you please clear the room 
and return via the registration 

04:00:40.999 --> 04:00:42.999
line outside.

04:00:44.214 --> 04:00:46.214
Thank you

05:15:24.019 --> 05:15:26.019
Test test

05:18:55.944 --> 05:18:57.944
Build a universal camera app

05:23:08.209 --> 05:23:11.704
Thank you all for coming.  Great
to see so many people here.  My 

05:23:11.705 --> 05:23:13.705
name is Oscar.

05:23:15.752 --> 05:23:17.807
and today we're going to speak 
about camera.

05:23:25.132 --> 05:23:29.232
major topics.  Second snap is 
here with us today.going to show

05:23:29.233 --> 05:23:32.088
case how they use the camera 
APs.

05:23:36.354 --> 05:23:38.772
And we will close with how 
camera API evolve and the 

05:23:38.773 --> 05:23:40.773
ecosystem that goes with it.

05:23:46.777 --> 05:23:49.014
compromises.  Some are outside 
of your control as a developer.

05:23:53.527 --> 05:23:56.164
make better decisions where you 
have control within your app.

05:23:59.836 --> 05:24:04.529
Let's cover how camera works at 
the physical level.  As any 

05:24:04.530 --> 05:24:06.530
photographer knows, it is a 

05:24:08.793 --> 05:24:11.453
steps at the physical level.  
The simple light goes through a 

05:24:11.454 --> 05:24:13.454
lense 

05:24:16.139 --> 05:24:18.139
which passes the light on to 
millions of light sensors.

05:24:21.047 --> 05:24:23.047
Then that converts the light 
finally pixels.

05:24:25.757 --> 05:24:28.000
When you think of light sensors,
the first thing that comes to 

05:24:28.001 --> 05:24:30.001
mind is 

05:24:32.726 --> 05:24:34.726
Now we have Cmoss and APS which 
are more 

05:24:36.163 --> 05:24:38.163
commonly used in today's modern 
cameras, phones, et cetera.

05:24:42.313 --> 05:24:44.313
as the camera module.

05:24:47.434 --> 05:24:49.434
raw picture, a raw frame.

05:24:50.491 --> 05:24:52.491
It is not entirely unprocessed, 
but it 

05:24:55.174 --> 05:24:57.661
the camera module at this stage.
You can think of the camera 

05:24:57.662 --> 05:24:59.662
module as 

05:25:01.741 --> 05:25:03.741
these frames.

05:25:05.456 --> 05:25:07.700
In early hardware, we have three
physical pins for different 

05:25:07.701 --> 05:25:09.701
kinds of pictures.

05:25:11.567 --> 05:25:13.794
days, modern designs, we have a 
single pin thanks to tricks like

05:25:13.795 --> 05:25:15.795
multiplexing so forth.

05:25:19.300 --> 05:25:20.935
But the consensual model remains
as having separate  processing 

05:25:20.936 --> 05:25:23.204
pipelines kind of image.

05:25:26.465 --> 05:25:28.465
We have generally speaking three
broad 

05:25:30.545 --> 05:25:33.382
recording.  We'll cover those 
separately.

05:25:41.110 --> 05:25:43.960
The camera module is a black box
T. amount of smarts within.

05:25:47.240 --> 05:25:49.240
Some of which are in a close  
feedback loop.

05:25:52.145 --> 05:25:53.977
with developers will have very 
little disability of what goes 

05:25:53.978 --> 05:25:55.978
on in there.

05:25:59.304 --> 05:26:01.763
when you say auto focus or auto 
wide balance, the cam practice 

05:26:01.764 --> 05:26:04.238
module may be optimize those 
settings and you don't 

05:26:07.483 --> 05:26:09.483
really have any control over 
that.

05:26:12.789 --> 05:26:14.789
all  developers do is send one 

05:26:15.833 --> 05:26:17.833
configuration in and you get one
frame out.very important.

05:26:20.507 --> 05:26:22.507
You send one configuration in 
and one frame out.

05:26:24.369 --> 05:26:26.425
configuration that goes with it.
To help you with  this, we have 

05:26:26.426 --> 05:26:28.426
a set configurations.

05:26:31.300 --> 05:26:33.300
We'll cover those later as well.

05:26:37.028 --> 05:26:40.316
one on.  To as I  said, each 
pipeline shown is brilliant use 

05:26:40.317 --> 05:26:44.809
case.  When it comes to preview,
you can think of it as the view 

05:26:44.810 --> 05:26:48.875
finder.somebody is holding their
phone up and you want to see 

05:26:48.876 --> 05:26:50.876
what the camera sees, 

05:26:52.394 --> 05:26:54.394
we're  talking about.

05:26:57.698 --> 05:26:59.698
We need to compromise on some 
things.

05:27:03.022 --> 05:27:08.108
so many  nings at once.  When 
did comes to preview, we.  The 

05:27:08.109 --> 05:27:13.440
user to be able to see what the 
sees much faster.  This is 

05:27:13.441 --> 05:27:15.441
general results in bare latency 
because we're able to compromise

05:27:16.525 --> 05:27:20.818
quality.  Some of us compromises
come in the form of reviews.

05:27:31.458 --> 05:27:33.916
You may want to enable our users
to capture high quality images.

05:27:40.826 --> 05:27:44.682
frame scene figures -- 
configures in one frame out.  It

05:27:44.683 --> 05:27:46.683
may mean you will not be able to
reuse the same raw frame.

05:27:51.201 --> 05:27:53.244
you are requesting different 
exposure.  So at the physical 

05:27:53.245 --> 05:27:56.914
level, the sensory different 
period of time that.  Means you 

05:27:56.915 --> 05:27:58.975
will have a different frame 
entirely.

05:28:37.260 --> 05:28:39.260
necks include exposure time.

05:28:40.758 --> 05:28:42.758
Some of them can be processing 
power, 

05:28:44.039 --> 05:28:46.039
number of other things.

05:28:48.308 --> 05:28:50.308
blend of the previous two.  We 
care about the speed.

05:28:55.239 --> 05:28:57.339
have frames come in consivity 
isivity isento lutef -- 

05:28:58.145 --> 05:29:00.145
consistently out of the camera.

05:29:02.002 --> 05:29:04.002
case we find the right balance.

05:29:06.717 --> 05:29:09.356
only test for so many things.  
Android runs in Maine devices, 

05:29:09.357 --> 05:29:14.903
not about low end too.  
Unfortunately, we can only test 

05:29:14.904 --> 05:29:16.904
and say so many things.

05:29:21.613 --> 05:29:23.450
tested scenario is when you have
preview pipeline running, plus 

05:29:23.451 --> 05:29:25.451
one other.

05:29:27.311 --> 05:29:30.175
hard time if you want to have 
all pipelines running 

05:29:30.176 --> 05:29:32.176
simultaneously.

05:29:34.864 --> 05:29:36.864
the hardware.  We discussed 
tradeoffs made by the 

05:29:40.561 --> 05:29:43.227
now we will dive into the 
application layer, what we as 

05:29:43.228 --> 05:29:45.228
developers can do.

05:29:46.924 --> 05:29:48.924
of a frame.

05:29:52.405 --> 05:29:54.405
are finally ready for us to use.

05:29:57.096 --> 05:29:59.096
Follow the steps, ESABC and it 
will fall?  Your lap.

05:30:02.813 --> 05:30:04.848
don't believe me, ask Snapchat. 
The first decision you have to 

05:30:04.849 --> 05:30:09.774
make as  the right device out of
the ones available in your list.

05:30:15.073 --> 05:30:17.073
Device here means the camera 
module.

05:30:18.157 --> 05:30:20.648
Each phone may have multiple 
cameras.  You probably have this

05:30:20.649 --> 05:30:22.649
one front, one back.

05:30:24.525 --> 05:30:28.646
especially important now that we
have multi-camera APIs.  You may

05:30:28.647 --> 05:30:30.278
have multiple devices that are 
back facing that you can choose 

05:30:30.279 --> 05:30:32.741
from.  So you will have to go 
through those 

05:30:37.219 --> 05:30:39.219
one fits your use case best.

05:30:40.474 --> 05:30:42.474
Once you have successfully 
opened the 

05:30:43.549 --> 05:30:45.549
cram device instance and that is

05:30:47.036 --> 05:30:49.299
necessary to pursuit forward in 
the open camera covac.

05:30:54.799 --> 05:30:56.220
the various same covac to 
monitor the statua of your 

05:30:56.221 --> 05:30:58.221
camera device.

05:31:02.757 --> 05:31:04.757
may be yanked from you if the 
device can 

05:31:05.777 --> 05:31:07.777
be done.

05:31:10.770 --> 05:31:12.770
camera output targets.  This is 
where each of the pipelines 

05:31:16.690 --> 05:31:18.531
your frames in the form of 
buffers.  The memory may already

05:31:18.532 --> 05:31:20.532
be allocated 

05:31:22.842 --> 05:31:26.097
get referenced tod underlying 
surface andfas as a target.  

05:31:26.098 --> 05:31:28.098
Otherwise may have to wait for a
callback.

05:31:30.170 --> 05:31:32.170
session, which is specific to 
the 

05:31:33.413 --> 05:31:35.413
open can be created.

05:31:41.765 --> 05:31:43.765
the camera capture session is 
specific 

05:31:45.266 --> 05:31:47.266
opened earlier.

05:31:48.331 --> 05:31:50.331
Once the session is ready, you 
can build a capture request.

05:31:53.230 --> 05:31:55.230
templates must be used.  If you 
don't want to take any of the 

05:31:59.162 --> 05:32:00.791
template manual for full 
control.  Otherwise, the 

05:32:00.792 --> 05:32:02.792
framework is going to 

05:32:05.947 --> 05:32:08.190
that closely align to the camera
consensual model we discussed 

05:32:08.191 --> 05:32:10.191
earlier.

05:32:12.934 --> 05:32:14.934
preview and photo and record.

05:32:17.202 --> 05:32:19.202
The capture request contains 
specific 

05:32:23.555 --> 05:32:25.555
output target we call frame 

05:32:29.056 --> 05:32:31.056
configuration inut and input and
out.

05:32:32.539 --> 05:32:34.548
surface here and attach it.  It 
needs to be one of the surfaces 

05:32:37.687 --> 05:32:39.687
the session.

05:32:40.943 --> 05:32:42.943
This is the configuration part 
of it 

05:32:44.222 --> 05:32:47.079
in the configuration in and out.
have chosen theical practice the

05:32:47.080 --> 05:32:49.080
best that we want.

05:32:51.561 --> 05:32:53.376
particular device and now we 
built a capture request that 

05:32:53.377 --> 05:32:55.377
will be used in that session.

05:32:57.734 --> 05:33:00.201
finally ask for a camera frame. 
We send the capture request to 

05:33:00.202 --> 05:33:02.202
the 

05:33:04.882 --> 05:33:07.336
We can do this if two ways.  We 
can send a request once or we 

05:33:07.337 --> 05:33:09.371
can request.

05:33:12.687 --> 05:33:14.687
This makes more sense in uses 
for preview or via record.

05:33:17.595 --> 05:33:20.455
configuration for every frame.  
This is easier to ask the 

05:33:20.456 --> 05:33:22.678
framework to continuously repeat
it.

05:33:31.288 --> 05:33:33.978
calVic to you want to listen to?
You should look inside of the 

05:33:33.979 --> 05:33:41.128
capture callback.you want to get
the frame for CPhuh processing, 

05:33:41.129 --> 05:33:43.129
one of the options is you 

05:33:46.643 --> 05:33:48.643
have seen image shredder.You can
get whatever picture information

05:33:52.332 --> 05:33:54.332
oust the output surface you had 
set up.

05:33:57.030 --> 05:33:59.113
that into the GPU, a great idea 
you is have seen running script 

05:33:59.114 --> 05:34:01.114
allocations.

05:34:02.397 --> 05:34:04.397
choice.

05:34:05.841 --> 05:34:08.305
And this is the cycle step 1 
through 5 that we need go 

05:34:08.306 --> 05:34:12.169
through for every single frame.
Recall.  One configuration in, 

05:34:12.170 --> 05:34:14.170
one frame out 

05:34:16.033 --> 05:34:18.033
and a bunch of tradeoffs in the 
process.

05:34:22.422 --> 05:34:24.422
&gt;&gt; All right.  Thanks, Oscar.

05:34:29.149 --> 05:34:31.149
My name is Mustafa Abrar.

05:34:33.011 --> 05:34:35.691
Oscar said about the lower 
layers of the camera and sort of

05:34:35.692 --> 05:34:38.304
work up to your app that you 
make and how they influence how 

05:34:40.382 --> 05:34:42.382
you interact with the camera.

05:34:44.664 --> 05:34:45.901
tradeoffs in terms of 
architecture, how to remark 

05:34:45.902 --> 05:34:47.902
feather the camera framework 

05:34:49.823 --> 05:34:51.065
app and we'll talk about 
specific challenges in sort of a

05:34:51.066 --> 05:34:53.066
more narrow use case.

05:34:58.863 --> 05:35:02.558
Snapchat, the first thing that 
haps is into the camera.  And 

05:35:02.559 --> 05:35:04.817
the reason for in is that people
use the cram now as a means of 

05:35:07.306 --> 05:35:10.149
They're taking a picture or 
they're  adding metadata, 

05:35:10.150 --> 05:35:12.807
creativity and then sending it.
really like the cursor where 

05:35:12.808 --> 05:35:14.808
what do you have to say and  
trying to get that out 

05:35:19.777 --> 05:35:21.777
possible is sort of the thing we
really value.

05:35:25.329 --> 05:35:27.329
decisions that we made and these
will the camera.

05:35:33.283 --> 05:35:35.286
video, in pictures, front cam 
remarks of them are full screen.

05:35:37.560 --> 05:35:39.560
Now you typically don't see this
in a lot of cameras.

05:35:41.652 --> 05:35:43.676
camera out, picture mode is 3 by
5 aspect ratio and a lot of 

05:35:43.677 --> 05:35:45.677
timings you 

05:35:47.951 --> 05:35:50.593
actually optimized for specific 
aspect ratios.  So since your 

05:35:50.594 --> 05:35:52.594
display is usually 16 by 

05:35:55.683 --> 05:35:56.714
other aspect ratio that might 
not be available for picture 

05:35:56.715 --> 05:36:00.977
mode.  We have to make a 
tradeoff. the devices will have 

05:36:00.978 --> 05:36:03.218
something that matches, but it 
might be really high 

05:36:06.723 --> 05:36:07.951
encode that and create a JPEG 
out of it just takes a long 

05:36:07.952 --> 05:36:09.952
time.

05:36:13.890 --> 05:36:14.902
terms of of the resolution we 
select for pictures and videos 

05:36:14.903 --> 05:36:16.903
and so forth.

05:36:17.962 --> 05:36:19.962
There's no video mode.

05:36:24.472 --> 05:36:26.472
When you have this design 
choice, it 

05:36:27.751 --> 05:36:29.751
leades to a set of optimizations
you 

05:36:31.206 --> 05:36:33.206
Videos you can tell the system 
the user is about to record.

05:36:37.819 --> 05:36:39.268
if you don't know the user's 
intense, if they long press or 

05:36:39.269 --> 05:36:41.333
take a picture, know ahead.

05:36:44.596 --> 05:36:45.815
So you can't decide upfront what
configurations are always going 

05:36:45.816 --> 05:36:50.719
to work.to do static 
configurations that are good in 

05:36:50.720 --> 05:36:52.720
a lot of scenarios and we have 

05:36:54.516 --> 05:36:56.516
and we update those depending on
what the user's intent is.

05:37:01.688 --> 05:37:04.117
Snapchat has offered lenses and 
features inside of the camera.

05:37:09.465 --> 05:37:11.465
motion, your face is moving and 
you're 

05:37:13.478 --> 05:37:16.277
user's face, optical image 
stabilization, there's a lot of 

05:37:16.278 --> 05:37:18.278
things 

05:37:19.513 --> 05:37:20.942
these things that want to keep 
track.  It has a lot of perform 

05:37:20.943 --> 05:37:22.943
overhead.

05:37:25.654 --> 05:37:27.654
need to balance the work that 
you do.

05:37:29.740 --> 05:37:31.740
You have to current the picture 
in 

05:37:32.781 --> 05:37:35.622
can get their message out as 
fast as possible.  Most cameras,

05:37:35.623 --> 05:37:37.623
if you take a picture, 

05:37:39.493 --> 05:37:41.493
latency and it stayses in the 
background.  You don't see T.

05:37:43.783 --> 05:37:46.449
how long it takes.  But for us 
because the real estimate 

05:37:51.002 --> 05:37:53.649
when users edit the canvassf the
image video.  You have to make 

05:37:53.650 --> 05:37:55.884
certain tradeoffs to have low 
latency to get there.

05:38:05.297 --> 05:38:07.363
these and some other features, 
you have support and be 

05:38:07.364 --> 05:38:09.418
university.  There's a few best 
practices that I'll share.

05:38:13.267 --> 05:38:15.304
sort of help broaden the width 
of devices you're able to target

05:38:15.305 --> 05:38:17.393
and also those devices.

05:38:20.684 --> 05:38:22.684
Over time, you will add 
features, lenses, interaction.

05:38:24.590 --> 05:38:26.590
that's extensible so you can 
plug and play different things.

05:38:31.966 --> 05:38:35.038
Oscar mentioned.  The part with 
the camera and there's versions.

05:38:37.279 --> 05:38:39.279
Camera one and it's been around 
for many years.

05:38:40.746 --> 05:38:43.795
And then there's also camera 
two, a  API.  Although, camera 

05:38:43.796 --> 05:38:45.796
one is  depredictionated, you 
know, when you 

05:38:49.725 --> 05:38:51.970
users, it's a big chunk that's 
still on camera one.  So you 

05:38:51.971 --> 05:38:56.041
need to support it regardless 
the device says.  The second 

05:38:56.042 --> 05:38:58.042
part is there's different 

05:38:59.084 --> 05:39:01.084
modes for camera two.

05:39:02.163 --> 05:39:05.056
adapt, they have a Legacy mode. 
We have made our API work, but 

05:39:05.057 --> 05:39:09.978
under 1.  And also camera 2 
varies by device.  Some say yep.

05:39:12.626 --> 05:39:15.122
Camera two works great here, but
in deep down, it is still camera

05:39:15.123 --> 05:39:20.821
1.  So the performance you get 
might vary across devices.really

05:39:20.822 --> 05:39:22.850
need ton each of the different 
products that you want to 

05:39:22.851 --> 05:39:24.851
target.

05:39:28.644 --> 05:39:30.644
since 2016 we have written both 
camera 1 

05:39:32.309 --> 05:39:34.969
of code and then what we do is 
we add a layer on top that's 

05:39:34.970 --> 05:39:36.970
basically what our 

05:39:38.832 --> 05:39:40.832
just unify what it looks like 
underneath.

05:39:42.674 --> 05:39:44.674
If you have shared coid

05:39:46.201 --> 05:39:48.201
full screen that I mentioned can
be shared by both.

05:39:50.299 --> 05:39:52.299
So there's shared code, but 

05:39:55.321 --> 05:39:56.953
Next part is there is millions 
of devices.  A lot of them have 

05:39:56.954 --> 05:39:59.005
bugs and they say certain 
feature.  It doesn't work.

05:40:04.562 --> 05:40:06.562
You zoom in beyond 99 %, a bug 
comes.

05:40:08.642 --> 05:40:09.654
that let us decide what 
behavior, what configuration to 

05:40:09.655 --> 05:40:11.655
adopt.

05:40:15.652 --> 05:40:16.878
really see and over time, you 
have to groom it.  You have to 

05:40:16.879 --> 05:40:19.762
maintain it.something that's 
just code.

05:40:25.061 --> 05:40:27.061
I talked about the camera 
interaction, 

05:40:29.596 --> 05:40:31.596
the coat, the code that talks to
the camera  system.

05:40:34.034 --> 05:40:36.034
Excuse me it

05:40:38.684 --> 05:40:43.375
APC.  If you expose this to your
applications, it is a little bit

05:40:43.376 --> 05:40:45.376
too raw.

05:40:46.449 --> 05:40:48.075
talk to the cam remarks they can
do  things that sort of conflict

05:40:48.076 --> 05:40:50.076
with each other.

05:40:51.577 --> 05:40:54.415
life cycling and things you need
to be aware.  We have a queue, 

05:40:54.416 --> 05:40:56.416
an operation queue 

05:40:57.929 --> 05:41:00.383
you coa less things that are 
redundant and manage sort of 

05:41:00.384 --> 05:41:02.384
invalid states.

05:41:05.090 --> 05:41:07.169
conflicting features by having 
an operation queue and a thread 

05:41:07.170 --> 05:41:09.170
that processes them.

05:41:11.483 --> 05:41:13.560
is so everything on your right, 
the gray side, is really about 

05:41:13.561 --> 05:41:15.561
the UI.  You know?

05:41:18.675 --> 05:41:20.921
button you see, the auto focus, 
the animations, all that and 

05:41:20.922 --> 05:41:27.434
then it has a okay.  The user 
tapped auto focus.  Let's ask 

05:41:27.435 --> 05:41:29.435
the camera to auto focus.

05:41:32.721 --> 05:41:36.172
in inform and tries to drive the
asynchronousd process.  On the 

05:41:36.173 --> 05:41:38.173
right-hand side and left-hand 
have different responsibilities.

05:41:38.800 --> 05:41:41.790
Your surface comes in over time.
Oscar was saying.

05:41:45.045 --> 05:41:47.720
It starts showing up on your 
screen.  You have lenses that 

05:41:47.721 --> 05:41:49.721
get composited on 

05:41:50.807 --> 05:41:52.807
of it and this is done in open 
GL.

05:41:54.831 --> 05:41:56.831
We try to do it sync ronewsly 
and not copying anything large.

05:41:57.667 --> 05:41:59.903
Your UI is composited on top.  
As far as the user is correspond

05:41:59.904 --> 05:42:01.904
Tall 

05:42:03.843 --> 05:42:06.072
reality, it is multiple layers 
coming together.  If you look at

05:42:06.073 --> 05:42:08.788
this, what you notice left and 
the right have sort different 

05:42:10.423 --> 05:42:12.423
things that you're concerned 
about.

05:42:13.958 --> 05:42:16.184
it is client server 
architecture.  The right-hand 

05:42:16.185 --> 05:42:18.185
side is like the  client.

05:42:20.458 --> 05:42:21.701
side is your run time, your  
processing and the concerns are 

05:42:21.702 --> 05:42:23.702
different.

05:42:25.763 --> 05:42:27.763
perspective, the left-hand side 
needs 

05:42:29.412 --> 05:42:31.878
to worry about processing frames
really fast T.worry about 

05:42:31.879 --> 05:42:34.315
disability and a lot of things. 
The right-hand side is about 

05:42:38.032 --> 05:42:40.906
features, a lot of the candy in 
terms of how the user interacts 

05:42:40.907 --> 05:42:42.907
with the camera.

05:42:44.792 --> 05:42:46.792
you ever work with client server
is 

05:42:47.832 --> 05:42:49.832
Takes hundreds of milliseconds. 
Sometimes some issues.

05:42:57.599 --> 05:43:00.554
You can use dationer use dagger 
and other approaches.

05:43:03.792 --> 05:43:06.707
We'll just mock the APIs to the 
Android system and maybe do a no

05:43:06.708 --> 05:43:10.173
op or send whatever we want to 
do.  One place where we take 

05:43:10.174 --> 05:43:12.174
advantage of it is performance 
testing.

05:43:15.267 --> 05:43:17.267
example, if you add new UI logic
and you 

05:43:20.016 --> 05:43:22.452
want to see if it regresses the 
cram way, you don't care how 

05:43:22.453 --> 05:43:28.197
long they take.  If they are 
variable and it takes 100 the 

05:43:28.198 --> 05:43:30.843
cram and it's variable because 
it's a system service, then over

05:43:30.844 --> 05:43:32.844
time, you 

05:43:34.738 --> 05:43:36.961
catch ten millisecond 
regressions.  What I am showing 

05:43:36.962 --> 05:43:38.962
here is a start up 

05:43:40.479 --> 05:43:42.479
So the camera has been mocked 
out.

05:43:44.797 --> 05:43:46.797
It is starting the app 
repeatedly and 

05:43:47.861 --> 05:43:50.518
how long it takes to get to a 
stable point.  We can catch 

05:43:50.519 --> 05:43:52.519
regressions around 

05:43:54.795 --> 05:43:56.622
what changed might have caused 
it.  Another example, instead of

05:43:56.623 --> 05:43:58.623
replacing 

05:44:02.643 --> 05:44:04.643
can replace part of it.

05:44:05.929 --> 05:44:08.982
You can keep other functionality
in tact.video file.

05:44:12.063 --> 05:44:14.063
And so this is very useful in 

05:44:16.358 --> 05:44:18.809
your face tracking.  In the lab 
environment where you run 

05:44:20.237 --> 05:44:22.488
integration tests, there's no 
faces.There's no people in the 

05:44:22.489 --> 05:44:24.489
lab to look at the camera.

05:44:26.989 --> 05:44:28.989
video files to drive that 
interaction.

05:44:31.884 --> 05:44:33.324
of me running some lenses where 
the frames have been mocked out 

05:44:33.325 --> 05:44:37.010
from a video file.  So there's 
me.Hello, I/O.

05:44:40.620 --> 05:44:42.620
You can seat

05:44:44.950 --> 05:44:47.417
see the paper showing.  It 
snaps, it takes a picture.

05:44:52.140 --> 05:44:54.140
you add new feature and just 
test things in isolation.

05:44:56.191 --> 05:44:58.191
So this is kind of in terms of 

05:44:59.238 --> 05:45:01.238
this gives you the performance 
considerations on the left.

05:45:09.066 --> 05:45:11.293
range supported that have  
cameras from front facing rear 

05:45:11.294 --> 05:45:13.294
and the remote that the 
performance considerations in 

05:45:16.226 --> 05:45:18.226
the UI and extense age.specific 
use case.

05:45:21.761 --> 05:45:25.829
Snap chat has known that the 
media is just images.guys take 

05:45:25.830 --> 05:45:28.070
photos and how does it all work?
We break it up into several 

05:45:28.071 --> 05:45:32.553
stages.capturing.  Quickly 
capturing the content so that 

05:45:34.592 --> 05:45:38.851
you can actually process and 
allow the be creative.  Once 

05:45:38.852 --> 05:45:40.852
they add all their creatives, 
you 

05:45:43.533 --> 05:45:45.578
that they have done and 
transdeed into something that is

05:45:45.579 --> 05:45:49.662
efficient to transport the 
recipient.  And the last part is

05:45:49.663 --> 05:45:54.369
rendering.  That's the part 
where the recipient the content 

05:45:54.370 --> 05:45:55.804
and depending on the choices you
make can really affect the 

05:45:55.805 --> 05:46:01.721
quality they see.  All of these 
are complicated things and we 

05:46:01.722 --> 05:46:03.722
have teams dedicate said to each

05:46:08.341 --> 05:46:10.341
will touch on the capturing one 
for  today.

05:46:14.238 --> 05:46:16.238
called, but there's a lot of 
latency involved in this step.

05:46:18.135 --> 05:46:21.032
camera one, the  API is called 
take picture.  It takes 400 

05:46:21.033 --> 05:46:23.913
milseconds on a really from last
year whereas if you take the 

05:46:26.575 --> 05:46:28.575
preview frame that's optimized 
for low 

05:46:31.627 --> 05:46:36.077
You can seat see the P90s are 
quite high.  We'll optimize as 

05:46:36.078 --> 05:46:40.795
much as we can our for specific 
devices we feel are pretty good 

05:46:40.796 --> 05:46:44.072
latency and we enable it 
remotely devices.  And users are

05:46:44.073 --> 05:46:46.073
delighted.  Wow.  The quality 
went up.

05:46:49.161 --> 05:46:51.161
It looks really cool.today.

05:46:53.601 --> 05:46:55.601
People notice it, but they 
notice the delay.

05:46:58.364 --> 05:47:00.613
will notice it right away.  So 
what we do is we try to do a 

05:47:00.826 --> 05:47:02.826
tradeoff.

05:47:04.698 --> 05:47:07.106
and screen shot on certain 
devices.  If it takes too long, 

05:47:07.107 --> 05:47:11.698
we fallback to the screen shot.
tricks to work around this.  You

05:47:11.699 --> 05:47:17.186
can see examples here where the 
noticeable.  But it is not 

05:47:17.187 --> 05:47:19.187
always a slam dunk.  In this 
case here, take a picture on 

05:47:20.676 --> 05:47:26.015
causing noise.  Sometimes the 
algorithms might overcompensate 

05:47:26.016 --> 05:47:31.543
and you will see speckling.not 
always turn it on.  Certain 

05:47:31.544 --> 05:47:35.401
front facing cameras we disable 
it.conditions.  So we balance 

05:47:35.402 --> 05:47:37.402
that.

05:47:39.491 --> 05:47:41.491
tradeoffs.  Oscar talked about 
the low level.

05:47:46.823 --> 05:47:50.102
design choices of what you 
decided in your application.  

05:47:50.103 --> 05:47:52.103
The user intent.

05:47:53.545 --> 05:47:54.567
picture and it's disappearing 
versus is the user preserving 

05:47:54.568 --> 05:47:56.568
something.

05:47:58.284 --> 05:48:00.109
we shared will help you guys 
build a better camera app.  

05:48:00.110 --> 05:48:02.110
Thank you.

05:48:09.128 --> 05:48:11.128
everyone.  My name is Vinit 
Modi.

05:48:14.423 --> 05:48:16.423
platform PM.

05:48:18.103 --> 05:48:19.939
Oscar earlier identified a 
seriesf tradeoffs to use cram to

05:48:19.940 --> 05:48:21.940
APIs.

05:48:23.647 --> 05:48:26.265
elaborated on that theme how 
they applied those tradeoff in 

05:48:26.266 --> 05:48:28.266
the real world situations.

05:48:30.602 --> 05:48:32.602
and talk about how working 
together we 

05:48:35.493 --> 05:48:37.493
both the developer and the end 
user experience.

05:48:43.039 --> 05:48:43.840
It's moved on from mere 
photography as in immersive 

05:48:43.841 --> 05:48:46.533
medium.great example of that is 
what was 

05:48:50.241 --> 05:48:52.241
demonstrated in the key note 
where the 

05:48:53.935 --> 05:48:56.777
is now used to do geo 
navigation.  In addition, 

05:48:56.778 --> 05:48:58.778
cameras are everywhere 

05:49:01.902 --> 05:49:03.318
there's a great example in the 
Android things booths, to your  

05:49:03.319 --> 05:49:10.289
laptops to devices.  And that's 
a trend that I want you all to 

05:49:10.290 --> 05:49:12.290
take away.

05:49:15.035 --> 05:49:17.035
are becoming the norm.

05:49:18.308 --> 05:49:20.168
Recall the camera model that 
Oscar talked about earlier in 

05:49:20.169 --> 05:49:22.169
the talk.

05:49:23.428 --> 05:49:28.517
do you extend that model in a 
multi-camera situation.  Let's 

05:49:28.518 --> 05:49:31.375
walk through an example.device 
with three back cameras.

05:49:35.674 --> 05:49:38.120
The Native camera app todayha 
access eachf these sensors.

05:49:41.658 --> 05:49:43.290
In addition, the Native camera 
app has something called the 

05:49:43.291 --> 05:49:47.365
logical camera.This is a virtual
camera.  It's made up of all the

05:49:47.366 --> 05:49:49.366
physical sensors.

05:49:52.872 --> 05:49:55.137
and it takes care of some of the
tradeoffs that Oscar and Mustafa

05:49:55.138 --> 05:49:57.138
alluded 

05:49:59.007 --> 05:50:01.689
performance and latency.  So in 
the native camera app, you 

05:50:04.354 --> 05:50:06.354
actually have four cameras.

05:50:07.806 --> 05:50:09.806
virtual, three physical in a 
three camera device.

05:50:11.460 --> 05:50:15.114
But as developers, you only get 
access them.  This is often 

05:50:15.115 --> 05:50:17.115
depends on the different types 
of devices.

05:50:20.235 --> 05:50:22.235
tradeoffs.

05:50:23.273 --> 05:50:25.355
You're using the APIs 
differently from the Native 

05:50:25.356 --> 05:50:27.356
camera app.

05:50:28.801 --> 05:50:31.441
to announce the starting with 
Android P you'll get access to 

05:50:31.442 --> 05:50:33.442
all the cameras 

05:50:34.729 --> 05:50:37.358
to all the physical streams.  
This applies to both the front 

05:50:37.359 --> 05:50:39.359
and 

05:50:43.273 --> 05:50:45.273
different form factors.

05:50:50.214 --> 05:50:52.214
The lady in the picture, this is
an image of a (inaudible) mode.

05:50:58.417 --> 05:51:00.417
optical  vision, getting 
monoChrome more.

05:51:02.085 --> 05:51:04.085
But most of all, we're excited 
of the 

05:51:05.583 --> 05:51:08.007
use case us that guys are going 
to build.walk through this API 

05:51:08.008 --> 05:51:10.043
real quick.  The first thing you
told is check the 

05:51:14.763 --> 05:51:16.763
check if the device, the logical
multi-camera API.

05:51:19.100 --> 05:51:21.143
Nyou would check to see which 
physical make up this logical 

05:51:21.144 --> 05:51:23.144
device.

05:51:26.088 --> 05:51:29.300
Today, we start support for RGB 
and add more.  Here it gets very

05:51:29.301 --> 05:51:34.638
interesting when you have a 
logical camera that is front and

05:51:34.639 --> 05:51:37.547
one back sensor.  Finally, you 
would check to see if the 

05:51:41.004 --> 05:51:44.470
are synchronized.  So I know 
what you're thinking.  Great.  

05:51:44.471 --> 05:51:46.501
New API.  Which devices will 
support it?

05:51:50.993 --> 05:51:52.993
new API?  The answer is yes.

05:51:57.121 --> 05:51:59.978
new devices will support this 
new API and we're working with 

05:51:59.979 --> 05:52:01.979
many partners to 

05:52:03.637 --> 05:52:05.637
devices also support this API.

05:52:06.678 --> 05:52:08.678
So let me call out a few 
partners.

05:52:11.798 --> 05:52:14.649
the monoChrome sensors are 
supported.  They helped us test 

05:52:14.650 --> 05:52:16.650
this API.

05:52:18.746 --> 05:52:19.968
insure that a majority of their 
devices support this API as 

05:52:19.969 --> 05:52:21.969
well.

05:52:27.592 --> 05:52:29.411
devices from both WA WA and 
(inaudible) support newup graded

05:52:29.412 --> 05:52:32.461
devices.Android 1 team.  We have
worked with manufacturers from 

05:52:41.411 --> 05:52:43.411
worked across all tiers of 
Android and 

05:52:44.496 --> 05:52:46.496
is not just exclusive topo tier.

05:52:48.161 --> 05:52:50.604
together we can elevate the 
camera experience  working with 

05:52:50.605 --> 05:52:55.933
you, our  we're really trying to
make sure that we can bring 

05:52:55.934 --> 05:52:57.934
amazing experiences.

05:53:00.219 --> 05:53:02.683
very excited to see what you're 
going to build with the new 

05:53:02.684 --> 05:53:04.684
Aperson Is and 

05:53:06.946 --> 05:53:09.801
you need make using these APIs. 
We'd love to continue the 

05:53:09.802 --> 05:53:11.802
conversation 

05:53:13.081 --> 05:53:14.901
space and thank you, Oscar and 
Mustafa for sharing their 

05:53:14.902 --> 05:53:16.902
insights.

05:53:19.950 --> 05:53:21.950
Thank you, ask snap

05:53:23.660 --> 05:53:26.137
Thank you everyone for attending
and enjoy I/O.

06:21:02.143 --> 06:21:04.143
Add transactional capabilities 
to 

06:21:06.988 --> 06:21:08.988
your actions

06:23:16.618 --> 06:23:18.618
I am Naomi Makofsky.

06:23:25.181 --> 06:23:27.181
assistant on Google.

06:23:29.875 --> 06:23:31.875
your typical day, you're buying 
coffee, 

06:23:33.171 --> 06:23:35.171
grossries and paying for dinner 
with your families and friends.

06:23:38.705 --> 06:23:41.146
about shift towards assistant 
and how actions on Google can 

06:23:41.147 --> 06:23:43.215
help users get things done.

06:23:47.924 --> 06:23:49.924
dive into how users can buy 
physical 

06:23:51.752 --> 06:23:53.752
goods and now digital goods 
through the assistant.

06:23:57.815 --> 06:24:00.477
understand the big picture.  
We're at an amazing point of 

06:24:02.706 --> 06:24:04.706
where users are turning to their
devices to get things done.

06:24:09.409 --> 06:24:11.409
goals across the widening 
landscape of these  devices.

06:24:16.151 --> 06:24:18.233
want to know, I want to go, do, 
see, hear understand moments 

06:24:18.234 --> 06:24:20.234
expecting to get 

06:24:22.710 --> 06:24:25.156
B or have a dinner reservation 
booked for them.  It is not just

06:24:25.157 --> 06:24:27.157
their mobile device 

06:24:29.424 --> 06:24:31.424
ing to in times of need.

06:24:33.106 --> 06:24:35.106
They have smart speakers, smart 
cars, 

06:24:38.839 --> 06:24:41.696
evac couples, the technology is 
embedded in everyday devices and

06:24:42.565 --> 06:24:44.565
accessible more than before.

06:24:45.623 --> 06:24:48.469
we discussed through I/O this 
week, our approach too this era 

06:24:48.470 --> 06:24:50.470
of digital 

06:24:51.728 --> 06:24:53.728
We're  seeing a few things 
happening.

06:24:56.453 --> 06:24:58.453
than they've ever been before.

06:25:00.104 --> 06:25:02.104
devices are far from the call 
center 

06:25:04.032 --> 06:25:06.032
menus of the past or chat box of
yesterday.

06:25:07.557 --> 06:25:09.583
to their devices with queries 
that are more natural and  

06:25:09.584 --> 06:25:11.584
querying beyond the key word.

06:25:13.112 --> 06:25:15.112
category for things like do I 
need an 

06:25:16.975 --> 06:25:18.975
umbrella today to weather  
10011.

06:25:22.328 --> 06:25:24.636
for these digital assistants 
have become mainstream.  There 

06:25:24.637 --> 06:25:27.326
is increased familiarity from  
members of the household all the

06:25:27.327 --> 06:25:31.032
way up to the oldest.  You can 
take my parents' house where 

06:25:36.984 --> 06:25:41.745
father cannot fall asleep with 
the can probably imagine.  But 

06:25:41.746 --> 06:25:43.746
lastly and most importantly, it 
comes down to our users.

06:25:49.365 --> 06:25:50.376
more curious and more demanding 
andmore impatient than ever 

06:25:50.377 --> 06:25:54.456
before.momentsf need.  Every 
time they want to know 

06:25:55.698 --> 06:25:57.698
something, go somewhere or do 
something and so on.

06:26:02.057 --> 06:26:03.066
as a result of 3 behavioral 
shift, so to have their 

06:26:03.067 --> 06:26:05.067
expectations.

06:26:06.479 --> 06:26:09.278
be more personal.  They want 
personalized results just for 

06:26:09.279 --> 06:26:11.279
them.

06:26:14.170 --> 06:26:16.170
me have increased over 60% in 
the last two years alone.

06:26:18.270 --> 06:26:20.270
realtime.

06:26:21.344 --> 06:26:23.344
From brands they want realtime 

06:26:24.448 --> 06:26:26.986
current events to be entertained
and consoled.  We see this on 

06:26:26.987 --> 06:26:28.987
social channels today.

06:26:30.081 --> 06:26:32.081
they want immediate results and.

06:26:33.773 --> 06:26:35.773
To know it can be delivered to 
them in 

06:26:37.789 --> 06:26:39.772
more than that, they want to 
know what is open now, what can 

06:26:39.773 --> 06:26:41.801
be delivered now, even book 
tonight at a discount, of 

06:26:43.493 --> 06:26:45.493
course, and we have seen that 
same day 

06:26:49.003 --> 06:26:51.003
category has increased over 100%
over the last two years.

06:26:53.505 --> 06:26:57.004
about the where.  Users want 
their brands to be everywhere 

06:26:57.005 --> 06:26:59.005
they are.

06:27:04.182 --> 06:27:05.400
So as we have been developing 
the Google  assistant, we 

06:27:05.401 --> 06:27:07.401
thought a lot 

06:27:09.470 --> 06:27:12.547
where and the how users are 
interacting with Google.  So 

06:27:12.548 --> 06:27:14.380
when they wake up, they're 
asking home what their day looks

06:27:14.381 --> 06:27:16.608
like.  When they go home, they 
will turn to 

06:27:22.532 --> 06:27:26.547
directions.  They're searching 
on Google.  They're plague games

06:27:26.548 --> 06:27:28.817
on their Android devices.fluid 
interaction across surfaces, 

06:27:30.298 --> 06:27:32.298
devices and properties and is it
stems 

06:27:34.789 --> 06:27:36.789
retrieval to content consumption
through action completion.

06:27:40.484 --> 06:27:43.751
areas and we think about how 
actions can throughout the day. 

06:27:43.752 --> 06:27:45.752
How can we streamline their 
morning?

06:27:49.319 --> 06:27:54.235
they're on the go?  And how to 
have a relaxing evening when 

06:27:54.236 --> 06:27:56.236
they're home.

06:27:58.911 --> 06:28:00.746
platform to be truly assistive. 
But more than that, the user has

06:28:00.747 --> 06:28:02.747
to be 

06:28:03.997 --> 06:28:05.997
way.

06:28:09.564 --> 06:28:13.852
updates, we will talk a little 
bit about  today.  Last year, on

06:28:13.853 --> 06:28:15.885
a stage very similar to this, we
announced that transactional 

06:28:20.183 --> 06:28:22.217
were coming soon to the 
assistant the DR transactions  

06:28:22.218 --> 06:28:24.218
API.

06:28:27.758 --> 06:28:30.230
ago, we launched it in the 
United States.  And now we're 

06:28:30.231 --> 06:28:32.231
doing this in even more 
countries.

06:28:35.944 --> 06:28:38.006
live in the UK, France, Germany,
Canada, Australia and Japan and 

06:28:38.007 --> 06:28:40.656
coming to more course of 2018 
and beyond.

06:28:45.270 --> 06:28:47.270
the actions on Google platform, 
we're 

06:28:54.775 --> 06:28:56.775
ability for user to purchase a 
good, 

06:29:01.804 --> 06:29:03.810
limits remain the same.  The 
dimmer will -- the twiner will 

06:29:07.442 --> 06:29:09.692
user in account linking and 
assist along the way.  We will 

06:29:09.693 --> 06:29:11.693
break this down a little bit 
further.

06:29:18.881 --> 06:29:23.959
purchase of a coffee or cycling 
class, three transaction types. 

06:29:23.960 --> 06:29:26.632
First a reservation or  
appointment booking.charge or 

06:29:26.633 --> 06:29:30.121
have a cost associated at the 
time of that booking.  The next 

06:29:30.122 --> 06:29:32.122
two require payments.

06:29:33.388 --> 06:29:34.627
the developer can support a 
transaction via the users 

06:29:34.628 --> 06:29:36.628
payment method that's their 
business.

06:29:39.091 --> 06:29:41.091
We call this bringing your own 
payment method.

06:29:42.984 --> 06:29:44.984
since you need to know who that 
user is 

06:29:46.020 --> 06:29:48.264
in order to charge their card, 
but the use a payment helper 

06:29:48.265 --> 06:29:50.265
from Google.

06:29:51.805 --> 06:29:54.798
So if you want to support a 
guest way to get that 

06:29:54.799 --> 06:29:56.810
information from Google and 
we'll talk about this one in a 

06:29:56.811 --> 06:29:58.811
bit.transaction.

06:30:01.858 --> 06:30:06.498
It's a fairly simple slow.  Like
any other transaction on the 

06:30:09.348 --> 06:30:11.375
able to send them updates 
throughout the life cycle of 

06:30:11.376 --> 06:30:13.376
their order to make sure it is 
on top of mine.

06:30:19.361 --> 06:30:21.361
Had maybe a few more French 
fries than 

06:30:23.257 --> 06:30:25.291
typical week.  So let's consider
a quick example.

06:30:30.382 --> 06:30:33.236
I tell the Assistant they would 
like class for Tuesday at 2:00 

06:30:33.237 --> 06:30:38.342
p.m.  Jay's cycle spot will 
confirm this booking.Tuesday at 

06:30:38.343 --> 06:30:40.804
2:00 p.m.  I say yes and my 
booking is complete.

06:30:44.880 --> 06:30:47.146
In the app, I get updates and 
tell spin class is still in 

06:30:47.147 --> 06:30:49.147
progress because I haven't quite
made it to that class 

06:30:52.029 --> 06:30:53.660
where I'm going, what I 
purchased and the stage of that 

06:30:53.661 --> 06:30:55.661
order.

06:30:58.788 --> 06:31:00.788
payment is required at that time
of booking.

06:31:02.280 --> 06:31:04.278
you're bringing your own payment
method or you're using Google to

06:31:04.279 --> 06:31:06.279
help you 

06:31:10.788 --> 06:31:13.438
First, you want to chick check 
that a help you with basic 

06:31:13.439 --> 06:31:15.886
settings and information to 
assist along the way.

06:31:19.975 --> 06:31:21.975
where you can check that 
transaction 

06:31:23.464 --> 06:31:25.464
settings are turned on so you 
don't get 

06:31:26.931 --> 06:31:29.165
the flow only to find out it 
can't transact.  If you are 

06:31:29.166 --> 06:31:33.229
shipping a good, you will 
delivery address.  So we can 

06:31:33.230 --> 06:31:36.097
help with that.  When they set 
up the assistant, they 

06:31:39.575 --> 06:31:40.997
information like payment 
information, delivery addresses 

06:31:40.998 --> 06:31:42.998
and so on.

06:31:44.252 --> 06:31:46.503
information and should you need 
it, we can help by passing you 

06:31:46.504 --> 06:31:48.504
this information 

06:31:50.589 --> 06:31:52.019
So if the user hasn't already 
entered information like their 

06:31:52.020 --> 06:31:54.264
delivery address, can also help 
you by prompting the user 

06:31:57.716 --> 06:32:00.594
for the entry and then resuming 
the conversation.  Wean the user

06:32:00.595 --> 06:32:02.595
wants to transact.

06:32:04.074 --> 06:32:06.074
So it is time to start building 
that cart.

06:32:10.600 --> 06:32:12.841
an order that is flexible and 
easy to use.  Libraries can hip 

06:32:12.842 --> 06:32:14.842
build quickly and way.

06:32:18.145 --> 06:32:19.968
You pass this in order and we'll
take care of presenting it to 

06:32:19.969 --> 06:32:21.969
the user in a 

06:32:23.269 --> 06:32:25.522
clear and consistent so the user
knows what they're buying and 

06:32:25.523 --> 06:32:27.523
how much they're paying for it.

06:32:30.440 --> 06:32:35.920
off in the  conversion funnel.
very familiar with this.  We 

06:32:35.921 --> 06:32:37.921
know that it is not about 
creating 

06:32:40.195 --> 06:32:42.444
getting the user through the 
point of transaction as easily 

06:32:42.445 --> 06:32:45.110
as possible.when you bring your 
own payment method 

06:32:48.563 --> 06:32:50.563
or when you use Google pay.

06:32:53.503 --> 06:32:55.127
payment method, you are using 
cred aspectuals that the user 

06:32:55.128 --> 06:32:57.993
has on file something like this.

06:33:01.254 --> 06:33:02.697
We accept from credit card to 
cash on delivery.  It is really 

06:33:02.698 --> 06:33:07.634
up to you.use the information 
you pass us to let the user 

06:33:07.635 --> 06:33:10.263
everyone exactly how they'll be 
paying.will notice that the user

06:33:10.264 --> 06:33:13.567
is going to be paying by a card 
and it's my gold card to be 

06:33:13.568 --> 06:33:15.568
exact.

06:33:17.873 --> 06:33:19.700
is a display friendly name that 
the user is able to see that 

06:33:19.701 --> 06:33:21.701
matches the payment 

06:33:23.964 --> 06:33:26.646
previously set up with your 
company.  Now, if you choose use

06:33:26.647 --> 06:33:28.647
a pilot helper 

06:33:30.548 --> 06:33:33.192
a bit more information about 
your processor.  Users have 

06:33:33.193 --> 06:33:35.193
already saved hundreds of 

06:33:36.276 --> 06:33:37.915
casheds to their Google's 
account and we can  securely 

06:33:37.916 --> 06:33:39.916
pass this information to 

06:33:41.370 --> 06:33:44.468
assistant transaction with the 
user's permission.  So you tell 

06:33:44.469 --> 06:33:50.043
Google who you need to how much 
you need to charge them for.  

06:33:50.044 --> 06:33:52.044
Google then encrypts the raw 
credit 

06:33:55.538 --> 06:33:56.558
processor's key to generate a 
credential and passes that 

06:33:56.559 --> 06:33:58.559
token.

06:34:01.254 --> 06:34:03.254
other credit card you have on 
your site.

06:34:04.508 --> 06:34:06.508
This is part of the Google pay 
APoh.

06:34:08.082 --> 06:34:11.158
you use Google pay and your 
Android app or site.  One  API 

06:34:11.159 --> 06:34:14.016
that works everywhere.pay 
supports the processor's listed 

06:34:14.017 --> 06:34:17.552
here and we'll have more coming 
soon to the platform.

06:34:22.027 --> 06:34:24.027
complete at that point of 
purchase.

06:34:27.232 --> 06:34:28.451
the user will find useful and 
follow on actions to help them 

06:34:28.452 --> 06:34:30.452
with next steps.

06:34:32.357 --> 06:34:33.984
API, you can send updates to the
user throughout the life cycle 

06:34:33.985 --> 06:34:35.985
of the order.

06:34:37.037 --> 06:34:38.669
let them know when the order is 
received, when it's being 

06:34:38.670 --> 06:34:42.778
processed or even when it's 
complete.Also, you can add 

06:34:42.779 --> 06:34:44.815
follow on actions.  So this 
enables the user to do things 

06:34:48.901 --> 06:34:51.152
purchase, place the reorder, 
contact you.  These are 

06:34:51.153 --> 06:34:53.153
seamlessly taking quick 

06:34:54.435 --> 06:34:56.435
post transaction.

06:35:05.418 --> 06:35:07.418
progress on enabling transax.

06:35:09.335 --> 06:35:11.605
lot of you guys, got your feed 
bark what, works what does not 

06:35:11.606 --> 06:35:15.306
work and that road map.  Thank 
you so much for that.

06:35:20.005 --> 06:35:22.005
roup dates as we launched 
transaction on 

06:35:24.102 --> 06:35:26.551
more countries, in more Google 
platforms.  We also talk about 

06:35:26.552 --> 06:35:28.552
supporting a lot 

06:35:31.266 --> 06:35:33.266
transactions and then we'll talk
on my 

06:35:34.533 --> 06:35:36.533
favorite topic on supporting 
digital topics on transaction.

06:35:39.227 --> 06:35:41.227
You can start  monetizing 
assistant.

06:35:44.335 --> 06:35:46.335
huge this year.  It is 
continuing to grow.

06:35:48.807 --> 06:35:50.807
through the key note and through
all the 

06:35:52.074 --> 06:35:54.074
I/O sessions that we've had so 
far, it's 

06:35:55.931 --> 06:35:57.931
for us and we'll continue 
investing in it.

06:35:59.203 --> 06:36:01.203
Starting this week we're 
announcing 

06:36:03.080 --> 06:36:05.080
to transant world wide.

06:36:06.376 --> 06:36:08.376
Neigh can buy physical goods and

06:36:11.668 --> 06:36:13.576
home, on third party speakers 
and the smart screens now 

06:36:13.577 --> 06:36:15.577
launching in July.

06:36:20.512 --> 06:36:22.512
mission to help users accomplish
their task.

06:36:24.375 --> 06:36:27.034
beyond the service provider, but
also help our users accomplish 

06:36:27.035 --> 06:36:29.035
their tasks in 

06:36:30.910 --> 06:36:33.178
that are convenient and that are
fast.  Throughout my session 

06:36:33.179 --> 06:36:35.179
today and 

06:36:36.442 --> 06:36:38.462
will, do you will see that 
payment.  We'll keep touching 

06:36:38.463 --> 06:36:41.343
base on that.journeys.

06:36:45.446 --> 06:36:47.774
You have seen in the slide 
before.  If you are anything 

06:36:47.775 --> 06:36:49.775
like me, nothing 

06:36:55.962 --> 06:36:57.962
First days of the week, that is 
nie first  transaction.

06:37:03.297 --> 06:37:05.297
solve simple but essential 
tasks.

06:37:07.362 --> 06:37:09.362
As I walk through few demos, I 
will 

06:37:10.576 --> 06:37:15.502
that are everyday used.  We use 
that often.  Also visualize the 

06:37:15.503 --> 06:37:17.503
opportunities 

06:37:18.556 --> 06:37:20.556
of these flows.

06:37:21.969 --> 06:37:24.487
Another thing I do, I will walk 
you through how we 

06:37:29.572 --> 06:37:31.572
learn through each of these 
demos.

06:37:35.505 --> 06:37:37.505
.  Hi, Google.

06:37:39.386 --> 06:37:41.386
Order my usual from Starbucks.

06:37:42.658 --> 06:37:44.658
That's all.

06:37:47.381 --> 06:37:51.699
usual  Starbucks?  That sounds 
good.45.

06:37:54.791 --> 06:37:56.791
But the balance on your 
Starbucks card is $1.

06:37:58.869 --> 06:38:08.580
30.your card?  Put $20.45.  Are 
you ready to place the order?

06:38:12.039 --> 06:38:15.312
I put your order in.  It will be
ready soon.  Enjoy.

06:38:18.570 --> 06:38:20.570
up my coffee after this session.

06:38:23.075 --> 06:38:25.917
something that our users will be
able to do fairly soon in a week

06:38:25.918 --> 06:38:28.370
or a few weeks from now.are two 
things I want to highlight from 

06:38:28.775 --> 06:38:31.014
this demo.  The first thing is 
personalization.

06:38:34.925 --> 06:38:37.802
and remember the experience, 
Starbucks knows my name, greeted

06:38:37.803 --> 06:38:39.803
me by my name.

06:38:41.072 --> 06:38:43.072
It even knew my drink.

06:38:45.157 --> 06:38:50.330
or the conversation that you 
call it to coffee you want.  

06:38:50.331 --> 06:38:52.112
Starbucks recommended me a usual
location based on what my 

06:38:52.113 --> 06:38:54.113
current 

06:38:55.381 --> 06:38:57.381
where I ordered in the past.  So
don't to have a conversation to 

06:38:59.897 --> 06:39:03.361
up the coffee.  So (inaudible) 
who knows your name and knows 

06:39:03.362 --> 06:39:05.999
what drink you want when you 
walk the local Starbucks, those 

06:39:06.000 --> 06:39:08.000
are the kinds 

06:39:11.143 --> 06:39:13.143
of experiences you we want to 
build on assistance.

06:39:17.443 --> 06:39:19.631
drive user trust, drive useer 
delight and loyalty on 

06:39:19.632 --> 06:39:24.550
assistant.payments piece.  In 
the first couple of 

06:39:24.551 --> 06:39:26.551
conversations, 

06:39:29.429 --> 06:39:32.303
location I am picking it up at. 
For most users, that's it.

06:39:36.795 --> 06:39:38.446
Starbucks needs to have a great 
coffee waits for you when you 

06:39:38.447 --> 06:39:40.705
enter the Starbucks.

06:39:45.000 --> 06:39:47.260
point that when it comes to 
payments, when it comes to 

06:39:47.261 --> 06:39:49.261
transactions, seemless 

06:39:51.931 --> 06:39:53.767
But equally important is clear 
transparency to the user on what

06:39:53.768 --> 06:39:55.768
they 

06:39:57.254 --> 06:39:58.675
much they are getting charged 
for who does the transaction 

06:39:58.676 --> 06:40:00.676
look like.

06:40:04.188 --> 06:40:06.244
experiences, you will see that 
resonating.  So just to 

06:40:06.245 --> 06:40:08.245
summarize.

06:40:09.315 --> 06:40:11.543
world wide this week.  The 
devices we support are Google 

06:40:15.836 --> 06:40:17.836
smart screens when they launch. 
We are already live in the U.S.

06:40:23.414 --> 06:40:25.876
up  UK, Canada, Germany, France,
Japan and Australia.

06:40:30.245 --> 06:40:32.245
does it mean for me?  Do I have 
is to start from scratch?

06:40:34.776 --> 06:40:37.476
I have to build the whole 
experience again?  What the cost

06:40:37.477 --> 06:40:39.477
of doing this is?

06:40:41.061 --> 06:40:43.749
launch a new surface, do I have 
to build my actions again?  The 

06:40:43.750 --> 06:40:45.750
short answer is no change.

06:40:47.286 --> 06:40:50.119
already had an action that was 
using transactions, working on 

06:40:50.120 --> 06:40:55.220
phones, it will for the Google 
home devices too.  For the smart

06:40:55.221 --> 06:40:57.221
screens too when it launches.

06:40:59.753 --> 06:41:02.277
needed on the outside to light 
up new surfaces.  We do the 

06:41:02.278 --> 06:41:07.375
heavy lifting to make sure 
crossed all surfaces.  Sometimes

06:41:07.376 --> 06:41:09.376
as eye developer, you might 

06:41:11.281 --> 06:41:15.194
vice-versaus when users on a 
screen.  And that's fine too.  

06:41:15.195 --> 06:41:17.195
You can actually build those  we
support T.

06:41:19.351 --> 06:41:20.365
the  underlying mechanismsf 
those transactions remains the 

06:41:20.366 --> 06:41:22.366
same.have to change.

06:41:24.871 --> 06:41:27.334
If you don't have an assistant 
yet, you have double the ranch 

06:41:27.335 --> 06:41:30.449
to go and build one.You get 
every new surface free with any 

06:41:32.321 --> 06:41:34.321
of these transactions.

06:41:38.722 --> 06:41:40.722
when you bring your own 
transaction method.

06:41:42.019 --> 06:41:44.019
When you use Google Pay, there 
is no 

06:41:45.493 --> 06:41:47.950
to light up the transaction on 
the Voice surfaces.  There are 

06:41:47.951 --> 06:41:52.482
two other things I will talk 
which I think were in the demo. 

06:41:52.483 --> 06:41:54.483
The first thing is built and 
intense.

06:41:56.915 --> 06:41:59.644
We launched built and intense.

06:42:05.819 --> 06:42:07.819
When a user says order me a 
coffee or 

06:42:12.133 --> 06:42:14.588
me a coffee, this is how aivity 
isant knows -- assistant knows 

06:42:14.589 --> 06:42:18.674
which action can fulfill one 
intent.To ask what we use for 

06:42:18.675 --> 06:42:20.675
matching and ranking.

06:42:23.195 --> 06:42:25.195
to sign up for the right 
intents.

06:42:26.275 --> 06:42:28.296
The second piece I will 
highlight is the conversation 

06:42:28.297 --> 06:42:30.297
design.

06:42:32.386 --> 06:42:35.080
Use dialect to create great 
conversations.  It is very 

06:42:35.081 --> 06:42:37.333
important to have your of the 
conversation.

06:42:40.388 --> 06:42:42.388
Make sure you use the brand 
tonality.

06:42:44.306 --> 06:42:45.329
you, they should know that it is
your brand that they are having 

06:42:45.330 --> 06:42:47.363
a conversation with.

06:42:53.270 --> 06:42:57.594
building blocks, I talk about 
quite a few of them.important 

06:42:57.595 --> 06:42:59.595
ones is account linking.

06:43:03.130 --> 06:43:05.130
If a user starts on phone, we 
will 

06:43:07.844 --> 06:43:10.699
over to phone to account link.  
And the drop offs for is very, 

06:43:10.700 --> 06:43:12.700
very high.number.

06:43:16.012 --> 06:43:17.641
We have a 90% plus drop off and 
the user over from the home 

06:43:17.642 --> 06:43:20.332
device over to account linking.

06:43:25.025 --> 06:43:27.025
starting a  developer review for
account linking over Voice.

06:43:31.433 --> 06:43:33.433
What that means is users can 
sign in 

06:43:34.887 --> 06:43:36.887
into an existing account using 
Voice.

06:43:38.781 --> 06:43:40.781
screen or a phone.

06:43:42.448 --> 06:43:45.286
A user can create a full new 
account in Excel over Voice 

06:43:45.287 --> 06:43:47.287
without having to go to any 
other  surface.

06:43:53.039 --> 06:43:55.691
in to an sifting surface, they 
will sign in to when they come 

06:43:55.692 --> 06:44:00.776
to any Voice devices.right?  I 
will talk go how it works as 

06:44:00.777 --> 06:44:09.170
well.forward.  You ask the user 
for sign in.consent.  Once the 

06:44:09.171 --> 06:44:11.629
consent is there, we share with 
you a Google token which has a 

06:44:11.630 --> 06:44:13.630
lot about the user.

06:44:17.325 --> 06:44:18.346
Think of the user's Gmail 
address and additional 

06:44:18.347 --> 06:44:20.347
information.

06:44:23.651 --> 06:44:26.299
user, you can link that okayf 
account and -- that account and 

06:44:26.300 --> 06:44:28.300
create the 

06:44:29.802 --> 06:44:32.226
We will use that token for 
future use.  If you do not find 

06:44:32.227 --> 06:44:35.721
that user, you can user with 
information that we give you and

06:44:35.722 --> 06:44:37.722
send us the token.

06:44:41.477 --> 06:44:43.477
saw earlier can come down as low
as zero 

06:44:45.519 --> 06:44:47.519
with some of these experiences.

06:44:53.068 --> 06:44:55.126
I think I will walk you through 
some some of what the APIs look 

06:44:55.127 --> 06:44:58.648
like.console, there's a separate
setting you have to sign up for.

06:45:02.576 --> 06:45:04.879
different surfaces and what 
experiences you want to build 

06:45:04.880 --> 06:45:06.880
for.

06:45:07.944 --> 06:45:11.647
speaks for itself.  Can for sign
in.  So when you ask for sign 

06:45:11.648 --> 06:45:13.648
in, we prompt 

06:45:14.920 --> 06:45:19.804
the flow.  Value token is the 
most important piece.  So when 

06:45:19.805 --> 06:45:21.805
permission -- when the user 

06:45:22.867 --> 06:45:24.867
the permission, we shared all of
this 

06:45:26.763 --> 06:45:28.763
information with the user.

06:45:31.104 --> 06:45:33.719
We send you the name, the given 
name, the last name, and much 

06:45:33.720 --> 06:45:35.720
more.

06:45:38.049 --> 06:45:40.049
your side if you want to.

06:45:46.641 --> 06:45:49.798
the beautiful experiences, let's
talk about more things.Here is 

06:45:49.799 --> 06:45:51.799
the summary of building blocks 

06:45:54.041 --> 06:45:57.528
experience.  The Voice 
experience we talked about.  

06:45:57.529 --> 06:45:59.529
Built and intense.

06:46:00.811 --> 06:46:02.631
a lot more implicit traffic.  
Personalization like needless to

06:46:02.632 --> 06:46:04.632
say 

06:46:06.930 --> 06:46:10.459
user trust.  Conversation 
designs and then the Voice  

06:46:10.460 --> 06:46:12.460
transactions.

06:46:15.653 --> 06:46:17.691
are visiting us from all 
different parts of the world, we

06:46:17.692 --> 06:46:19.692
are  eaching up in 

06:46:22.170 --> 06:46:25.022
Spain, Italy and India too.  And
know we're adding more 

06:46:25.023 --> 06:46:27.023
marketings 

06:46:30.124 --> 06:46:33.017
A lot of exciting stuff 
happening on Voice.  I.  Sure 

06:46:33.018 --> 06:46:36.975
you guys will want to see what  
look like.  We will share the 

06:46:36.976 --> 06:46:41.063
link towards another talk where 
you can go and see all of lot 

06:46:41.064 --> 06:46:45.762
more detail.  But let's continue
through our journey.  We talked 

06:46:45.763 --> 06:46:47.428
about the (inaudible) chain.
Let's talk about users on the  

06:46:47.429 --> 06:46:52.331
go.  She has a coffee in her 
hand.the go.

06:46:58.887 --> 06:47:00.887
surfaces there on search, 
they're on more.

06:47:03.428 --> 06:47:05.669
And we want to provide a 
consistent experience to our 

06:47:05.670 --> 06:47:08.118
users when they move to another.

06:47:11.606 --> 06:47:13.868
Why should the experience be any
painful on any Googlesur face --

06:47:13.869 --> 06:47:15.869
Google surface.

06:47:18.843 --> 06:47:20.669
are bringing them across all 
surfaces.  I mean identity which

06:47:20.670 --> 06:47:22.670
is the Google 

06:47:25.425 --> 06:47:27.277
about, payments, receipts and a 
lot more helpers like delivery 

06:47:27.278 --> 06:47:29.278
addresses and locations and so 
on.

06:47:32.827 --> 06:47:36.090
So these are now able cross 
multiple surfaces.  Let's me 

06:47:36.091 --> 06:47:38.091
show you guys a quick demo on 

06:47:39.156 --> 06:47:41.156
in search and we'll go into more
details on that.

06:47:46.099 --> 06:47:48.929
tasks and we talked about the 
coffee, the essential tasks 

06:47:48.930 --> 06:47:50.930
which is getting 

06:47:59.308 --> 06:48:01.308
movie tickets:  So movies near 
me, A

06:48:03.277 --> 06:48:06.950
breaking -- avengers is break 
every record out there.  Fine 

06:48:06.951 --> 06:48:08.951
dango offer fast checkout.

06:48:09.966 --> 06:48:13.988
that.  So the fandango 
experience on what we have build

06:48:13.989 --> 06:48:15.989
is all on app.

06:48:19.079 --> 06:48:21.079
all about how to deliver  
content fast.

06:48:22.752 --> 06:48:25.840
Now they're bring transactions 
into AMP.transactional 

06:48:25.841 --> 06:48:27.841
experiences will get very fast. 
I am showing all production.

06:48:31.610 --> 06:48:33.847
You will see they're very much 
what our users see when we take 

06:48:33.848 --> 06:48:35.848
it live.

06:48:37.102 --> 06:48:42.673
select two tickets.  Next.  
General admission.  Sounds good 

06:48:42.674 --> 06:48:44.674
to me.  Next.

06:48:48.818 --> 06:48:51.291
the payment information.A a 
user, you don't have to give any

06:48:58.308 --> 06:48:59.932
Obviously none of this is shared
with fandango till the 

06:48:59.933 --> 06:49:01.933
transaction is done.

06:49:05.284 --> 06:49:07.284
Complete with chase.  And the 
transaction goes through.

06:49:10.646 --> 06:49:12.646
booked for me for today evening.

06:49:14.096 --> 06:49:16.096
And the other thing with this is
if 

06:49:18.389 --> 06:49:20.822
screen, there is a my order 
experience where I can go and 

06:49:20.823 --> 06:49:22.823
find and track and I 

06:49:26.610 --> 06:49:28.676
So if I want to find where this 
is, I have to look for the 

06:49:28.677 --> 06:49:30.677
tickets and a 

06:49:32.140 --> 06:49:34.140
place where any user can go and 
get the information.

06:49:35.839 --> 06:49:37.839
They can ask assistant what time
is 

06:49:42.371 --> 06:49:44.719
and assist ant will answer the 
question.  It looks like I am 

06:49:44.720 --> 06:49:46.720
not fandango customer.

06:49:50.813 --> 06:49:52.488
to lose the points I get on 
buying movie tickets.  This 

06:49:52.489 --> 06:49:54.489
share and sign in.  Looks good.

06:49:58.307 --> 06:50:01.303
And will this is account 
linking.  I have account created

06:50:01.304 --> 06:50:03.304
on fandango 

06:50:06.910 --> 06:50:09.543
I will go in and try to get 
fandango tickets.  It is all 

06:50:09.544 --> 06:50:11.588
linked through my Google 
profile.

06:50:21.502 --> 06:50:24.150
So that's the demo I had for 
fandango.  Our users can do so 

06:50:24.151 --> 06:50:26.847
much coming in for and other 
things.

06:50:29.922 --> 06:50:31.573
The beauty is users get a fast 
check out because of these 

06:50:31.574 --> 06:50:33.574
experiences.

06:50:35.465 --> 06:50:38.115
are what we call convenience 
optimized.  Users almost never 

06:50:38.116 --> 06:50:42.412
have to fill out a show you a 
much more complicated experience

06:50:42.413 --> 06:50:44.413
in a (inaudible).

06:50:47.517 --> 06:50:49.517
track all their receipts.

06:50:53.214 --> 06:50:55.853
Excuse me from a merchant's 
perspective, you have full 

06:50:55.854 --> 06:50:57.854
control over the UI.

06:51:01.998 --> 06:51:03.998
create differential experiences 
for your users.

06:51:06.159 --> 06:51:08.598
the customer coming to your 
website, a visitor coming to 

06:51:08.599 --> 06:51:13.918
your  app.a loyal customer.  So 
I think that's one big value 

06:51:13.919 --> 06:51:15.919
from this  experience.

06:51:17.784 --> 06:51:19.784
higher conversion rates.

06:51:21.731 --> 06:51:23.731
With Google Pay, we have two 
partners.

06:51:25.620 --> 06:51:27.620
conversion rates going back  
20%.

06:51:28.880 --> 06:51:30.880
So that's a big lift for a lot 
of partners and developers.

06:51:33.671 --> 06:51:35.722
merchants spend less time 
planning and let's you focus on 

06:51:35.723 --> 06:51:38.799
what makes sense for your 
business.I showed for fandango, 

06:51:38.800 --> 06:51:40.800
you will see 

06:51:41.873 --> 06:51:43.873
something like that coming soon 
with it as well.big.

06:51:47.313 --> 06:51:49.313
One of

06:51:50.502 --> 06:51:52.502
my favity activities -- favorite
activities.

06:51:58.727 --> 06:52:00.727
When you order food, food 
ordering includes nuances.

06:52:07.348 --> 06:52:09.582
restaurant, menus are like 10 
pages long.  There's menu 

06:52:09.583 --> 06:52:11.583
browsing and customization.

06:52:14.920 --> 06:52:17.767
as a user, you want something 
glutin free, I want extra 

06:52:17.768 --> 06:52:22.301
spicey, I want what not.  After 
you have what you want to order 

06:52:25.274 --> 06:52:26.506
figured out, then is it is 
delivery I want to deliver at 

06:52:26.507 --> 06:52:28.507
this time.

06:52:30.174 --> 06:52:32.174
I want delivered in a window of 
3 to fire.

06:52:34.006 --> 06:52:36.006
3 clocks

06:52:39.384 --> 06:52:44.257
the door and you can leave the 
food at the door.order.

06:52:47.535 --> 06:52:49.357
You want to know realtime where 
the dasher is.  You want that 

06:52:49.358 --> 06:52:54.253
experience to be fast should 
just work out of the box.  Let's

06:52:54.254 --> 06:52:57.507
look what doordash experience 
looks like.quick video.

06:53:01.631 --> 06:53:03.631
Order delivery from companyina 
venty with doordash.

06:53:08.160 --> 06:53:11.030
This is the menu browsing piece 
I was talking about.  This is 

06:53:11.031 --> 06:53:13.031
the customization.

06:53:16.956 --> 06:53:23.675
using AMP.  Add to order.  So 
let's add a dessert too.  They 

06:53:23.676 --> 06:53:27.956
have good desserts by the way.
are down the street.  So check 

06:53:27.957 --> 06:53:31.048
out the saint thing with the 
payment selected.on the file.

06:53:34.760 --> 06:53:36.760
And you can do the transaction 
place order or replaced.

06:53:38.445 --> 06:53:40.679
experience for our users.  Even 
without signing in can actually 

06:53:41.907 --> 06:53:43.907
complete transactions.

06:53:46.380 --> 06:53:48.380
multiple different entry points.

06:53:50.672 --> 06:53:52.672
ordering and so on.

06:53:53.979 --> 06:53:55.979
So let's talk about useers last 
piece 

06:53:57.507 --> 06:54:02.007
customer journey which is have a
relaxing evening at home.  Today

06:54:02.008 --> 06:54:04.008
we're announcing (inaudible) 

06:54:05.337 --> 06:54:07.337
that means is our users can now 
buy digital goods on assistant.

06:54:15.267 --> 06:54:17.267
on phones and on order Voice 
devices.  U.S.

06:54:22.581 --> 06:54:24.581
seven markets we talked about 
earlier.

06:54:25.853 --> 06:54:27.853
So it's been a tiring day and 
tirey 

06:54:29.861 --> 06:54:31.868
and when you go back to your 
hotel or to your room or house 

06:54:31.869 --> 06:54:33.869
based on where you 

06:54:37.381 --> 06:54:39.393
I prefer meditating.  So let me 
walk you through an experience.

06:54:43.147 --> 06:54:46.411
Is this is basic session, free 
package from headspace.little 

06:54:46.412 --> 06:54:51.141
bit.  10 minutes two days in a 
row.  And that's all headspace 

06:54:51.142 --> 06:54:53.142
offers are free.

06:54:55.249 --> 06:54:57.249
subscribe to headspace now.  
Yes.  Makes sense.

06:55:00.362 --> 06:55:02.362
Three products headspace offers 
are 

06:55:05.308 --> 06:55:08.594
annual and $400 lifetime.  I'm 
cheap.  So I will stick with the

06:55:08.595 --> 06:55:10.595
$12 monthly package.

06:55:14.524 --> 06:55:16.766
So here is a proposed order.  
Remember when I talked about you

06:55:16.767 --> 06:55:18.767
have 

06:55:21.095 --> 06:55:23.331
what product they're buying, 
what credit card is being used 

06:55:23.332 --> 06:55:25.332
and what the price point is.

06:55:27.430 --> 06:55:29.430
to propose that before they 
subscribe.  Transaction is done.

06:55:31.316 --> 06:55:34.161
You are on your way.sent to you.

06:55:38.035 --> 06:55:40.072
You have this experience 
enabled.  Now, the beauty of the

06:55:40.073 --> 06:55:42.073
solution is 

06:55:44.344 --> 06:55:46.344
consume the digital goods across
surfaces.

06:55:47.821 --> 06:55:49.821
If a user bought something on 
the 

06:55:51.579 --> 06:55:53.579
they can access that digital 
good on assist ants.

06:55:54.846 --> 06:55:56.867
If a user buys something using 
this on  they are able to access

06:55:56.868 --> 06:55:58.868
the same experience on Android 
too.

06:56:03.281 --> 06:56:05.281
how they jump different devices 
across 

06:56:06.967 --> 06:56:08.967
assistant and Google surfaces, 
the 

06:56:10.906 --> 06:56:13.378
experiences they have seamlessly
flow.  From a developer's 

06:56:13.379 --> 06:56:15.379
perspective, 

06:56:16.877 --> 06:56:18.877
is assistant play integration.

06:56:21.361 --> 06:56:23.361
If you are a developer who saves

06:56:26.598 --> 06:56:29.385
up transactions on assist ant 
too.  You are using play 

06:56:29.386 --> 06:56:31.386
console.

06:56:34.482 --> 06:56:36.482
and so on.

06:56:37.539 --> 06:56:40.389
High developer looks something 
like this.  You can now sell the

06:56:40.390 --> 06:56:42.390
experience to the user.

06:56:43.665 --> 06:56:49.585
the squeu.  If yes, you can 
deliver that to the user.not, 

06:56:49.586 --> 06:56:51.611
you call the Google APIs and we 
tell you what the squeus can you

06:56:51.612 --> 06:56:53.612
sell to 

06:56:55.707 --> 06:56:57.787
any filtering criteria that you 
might have.  You propose the 

06:56:57.788 --> 06:57:02.118
order with the product The user 
confirms yes.  We process that 

06:57:02.119 --> 06:57:04.119
transaction and we 

06:57:05.780 --> 06:57:08.647
is a transaction confirmation.  
Here is a purchase token and you

06:57:11.976 --> 06:57:14.020
on to the user.  So this is a 
great opportunity for our 

06:57:16.696 --> 06:57:21.999
developers to monetize.and 
experiences.  So for example, 

06:57:22.000 --> 06:57:24.714
the headspace experience was 
premier experiences.

06:57:28.036 --> 06:57:30.919
space, a lot of you guys might 
be aware of coins or extra lives

06:57:30.920 --> 06:57:36.241
and extra turns.whatever you can
sell from a gaming perspective 

06:57:36.242 --> 06:57:38.242
works beautiful in this 
experience.

06:57:42.421 --> 06:57:44.421
cart digital media purchases 
like 

06:57:45.441 --> 06:57:48.163
renteddal like rentals and so 
on.

06:57:52.324 --> 06:57:52.927
digital goods, they're opening 
up to sell on all assistant 

06:57:52.928 --> 06:57:54.928
surfaces.

06:58:08.840 --> 06:58:10.840
few months since we have 
launched, so developed brands.

06:58:14.167 --> 06:58:16.167
Enable that user wherever they 
are.

06:58:18.055 --> 06:58:20.055
You can buy your pizza from 
dominoes 

06:58:21.538 --> 06:58:23.538
pretty soon you'll be able to 
get your 

06:58:24.834 --> 06:58:26.834
favorite Starbucks coffee from 
the Assistant as well.

06:58:29.519 --> 06:58:31.577
continue additional 
functionality, we're so excited 

06:58:31.578 --> 06:58:36.316
to see what you developed for 
what we can all build together. 

06:58:36.317 --> 06:58:38.317
Thank you so much for  joining 
us on 

06:58:40.618 --> 06:58:42.618
hope to see you next year.

06:58:45.672 --> 06:58:47.672
[APPLAUSE]

07:00:19.124 --> 07:00:21.124
Sound amplifier and the new 
Dynamics 

07:00:22.143 --> 07:00:24.143
Processing Effect

07:23:14.701 --> 07:23:16.701
everybody.  My name is Brian 
Kemler.

07:23:19.529 --> 07:23:21.529
I

07:23:24.100 --> 07:23:26.100
Ricardo Garcia.

07:23:27.769 --> 07:23:29.769
last day of I/O?

07:23:33.075 --> 07:23:36.939
Last session?  Woo-hoo.for 
coming out.  It was a great I/O.

07:23:39.396 --> 07:23:41.396
Today we have a lot of really 
exciting things to talk about.

07:23:42.904 --> 07:23:45.147
Primarily geared for developers.
We're going to be talking about 

07:23:45.148 --> 07:23:47.148
a few 

07:23:51.851 --> 07:23:53.716
Android P called sound 
amplifier.  We're going to be 

07:23:53.717 --> 07:23:55.717
doing a little bit 

07:23:59.208 --> 07:24:01.477
we can improve the sound in any 
type of situation for users and 

07:24:01.478 --> 07:24:03.478
how you can do developer.

07:24:06.401 --> 07:24:09.091
We're going to go and do a deep 
dive into the inner  workings of

07:24:09.092 --> 07:24:11.092
sound 

07:24:13.979 --> 07:24:15.801
the Dynamics Processing Effect 
upon which its built live with 

07:24:15.802 --> 07:24:18.298
code examples.really cool.  
Let's dive right in.

07:24:29.343 --> 07:24:31.343
empty field with a massive set 
of ears.

07:24:35.268 --> 07:24:37.334
is we live, work and play with 
an increasing amount of 

07:24:37.335 --> 07:24:39.335
environmental noise.

07:24:42.660 --> 07:24:44.660
sound is one of the most common 
environmental problems.

07:24:49.608 --> 07:24:51.608
It's not only annoying, but it 
from understanding our friends, 

07:24:52.661 --> 07:24:54.661
colleagues and loved ones.

07:24:55.901 --> 07:24:57.901
No matter how well we can hear, 
most 

07:24:59.702 --> 07:25:02.082
us can relate to the following 
acoustically challenging 

07:25:02.083 --> 07:25:04.083
situations.

07:25:06.764 --> 07:25:09.409
date in a loud restaurant or a 
loud bar.  Trying to listen to a

07:25:09.410 --> 07:25:11.410
caller in a 

07:25:15.504 --> 07:25:17.504
Trying to listen to a speaker 
who's 

07:25:20.009 --> 07:25:22.009
talking way too softly like me 
now.

07:25:25.999 --> 07:25:27.999
environmental noise as a form of
situational disability.

07:25:33.964 --> 07:25:35.376
just your Smartphone so you 
nevermis a word in a 

07:25:35.377 --> 07:25:37.377
conversation?

07:25:43.266 --> 07:25:45.266
introducing sound amplifier

07:25:46.618 --> 07:25:48.618
What is sound amplifier?

07:25:49.880 --> 07:25:51.880
Sound amplifier is a new 
accessibility 

07:25:56.037 --> 07:25:58.037
on real world conversations 
using only 

07:25:59.144 --> 07:26:01.144
your Android Smartphone and a 
set of headphones.

07:26:03.838 --> 07:26:05.838
tune to hundreds of personalized
levels 

07:26:07.489 --> 07:26:09.489
to optimize their listening 
experience 

07:26:14.282 --> 07:26:16.282
It's two sliders for loudness 
and tuning.

07:26:18.338 --> 07:26:22.935
Dynamically adjust over 100 
audio in the background.  These 

07:26:22.936 --> 07:26:24.936
settings can be applied 
independently to each ear.

07:26:30.124 --> 07:26:32.124
the sound quality in an after 
ray of 

07:26:35.606 --> 07:26:37.606
situations -- an array of 
situations.

07:26:44.185 --> 07:26:46.415
somebody who speaks too softly, 
turning up the TV volume to one 

07:26:46.416 --> 07:26:48.416
that's 

07:26:50.706 --> 07:26:52.706
the room without blasting 
everybody else.

07:26:54.777 --> 07:26:56.777
So now I'm going to go in and 
talk a 

07:27:00.808 --> 07:27:02.808
we built it the APIs and the 
effect upon 

07:27:03.858 --> 07:27:05.858
which it was built and I'll do 
some demos.

07:27:09.884 --> 07:27:11.884
is base on Android P's 
processing effect.

07:27:13.779 --> 07:27:16.245
The effect is a 4-stage signal 
and I'm going to walk you 

07:27:16.246 --> 07:27:18.246
through each 

07:27:19.286 --> 07:27:21.286
stage and then Ricardo will come
in a 

07:27:22.977 --> 07:27:25.815
deep dive into this and show the
developers in the audience how 

07:27:25.816 --> 07:27:27.816
they can applications.

07:27:33.996 --> 07:27:36.045
Stage 1 is pre-equalization.  
You can think of 

07:27:36.046 --> 07:27:38.046
pre-equalization as 

07:27:43.050 --> 07:27:45.050
that you can programmatically 
adjust any raidio frequency.

07:27:48.544 --> 07:27:50.544
Think base, mid-range and 
treble.

07:27:52.765 --> 07:27:54.765
Stage 2 is a multi-ban 
compressor.

07:27:56.624 --> 07:27:59.466
The multi-ban  compressor is the
heart dynamics processing 

07:27:59.467 --> 07:28:01.467
effect.  What it does is really 
unique.

07:28:07.822 --> 07:28:10.060
really loud or irfating sounds. 
Don't worry.  I won't make any.

07:28:14.351 --> 07:28:19.632
are too soft.  It can do all of 
this without changing the 

07:28:19.633 --> 07:28:22.499
characteristics of the 
underlying that you put into the

07:28:22.500 --> 07:28:24.500
system.

07:28:26.959 --> 07:28:28.959
The third stage is also an  

07:28:30.421 --> 07:28:32.421
allows to you fine tune the 
outfut from 

07:28:35.931 --> 07:28:37.931
the original MBC and  
pre-equalizer and 

07:28:42.454 --> 07:28:44.889
What happened the limiter does 
is protects users from 

07:28:44.890 --> 07:28:46.890
additional gain or 

07:28:48.355 --> 07:28:51.347
volume above a certain developer
designated thresh hold so that 

07:28:51.348 --> 07:28:53.348
there are 

07:29:02.735 --> 07:29:05.587
little demo.  So I'm going to 
play a very typical 

07:29:09.312 --> 07:29:11.312
micro kitchen water cooler type 
of break 

07:29:12.777 --> 07:29:17.855
where there's a loud espressor 
maker in I'm in this.  I star in

07:29:17.856 --> 07:29:19.856
this.

07:29:43.786 --> 07:29:45.786
So I can adjust this and start 
to hear the conversation.

07:29:47.240 --> 07:29:50.083
this is customizable or tuneable
for every user.  Doing this 

07:29:50.084 --> 07:29:52.084
again.  I get to star again.

07:29:55.833 --> 07:29:58.096
really not this into myself.  
Here's my talking kind of 

07:29:58.097 --> 07:30:04.192
rehearsing this talk right now.
speaking to quietly.  So this 

07:30:04.193 --> 07:30:06.193
will be another example of how 

07:30:07.263 --> 07:30:09.263
hear it better.

07:30:10.720 --> 07:30:13.381
The other thing they also forgot
to mink was use this with your 

07:30:13.382 --> 07:30:17.843
headphones can think of what's 
in the video as what you would 

07:30:17.844 --> 07:30:19.844
be hearing in your  headphones.

07:30:25.302 --> 07:30:27.302
under the best circumstances in 
a quiet 

07:30:30.802 --> 07:30:32.802
background noise and a large set
of ears.

07:30:35.794 --> 07:30:38.291
&gt;&gt; But in noisy conditions, the 
everyday reality is that we 

07:30:38.292 --> 07:30:40.292
work, play, 

07:30:41.971 --> 07:30:43.971
So listening is difficult.

07:30:51.377 --> 07:30:53.377
any acoustic situation to the 

07:30:56.892 --> 07:30:59.572
forth and Ricardo is going to 
deep dive in and talk a little 

07:30:59.573 --> 07:31:01.573
bit more about the 

07:31:02.691 --> 07:31:04.940
effect and how developers can 
start using this today.

07:31:11.873 --> 07:31:13.873
Well, now we saw the demos and 
we saw 

07:31:15.157 --> 07:31:17.826
actually working in real life.  
So we are going to go down and 

07:31:17.827 --> 07:31:19.827
see how 

07:31:21.916 --> 07:31:23.916
what is the magic behind it.

07:31:26.617 --> 07:31:28.617
to you the hearing treasure.

07:31:30.893 --> 07:31:33.373
I will explain to you what is 
here.  Here we are seeing what 

07:31:33.374 --> 07:31:37.926
is the for the average human.  
The hearing threshold is 

07:31:37.927 --> 07:31:39.927
actually how 

07:31:42.825 --> 07:31:44.825
to lease into the sound.

07:31:46.284 --> 07:31:48.284
So in this plot, we can see from
left 

07:31:54.280 --> 07:31:56.481
high frequencies from 20 Hertz 
to (inaudible).  We see how much

07:31:56.482 --> 07:31:58.482
energy we actually the sounds.

07:32:02.417 --> 07:32:04.417
So because this is the 
(inaudible) of  

07:32:05.873 --> 07:32:08.709
below that thresh hold will not 
be heard by people.  So for 

07:32:08.710 --> 07:32:10.710
example, if we go and we look 

07:32:13.652 --> 07:32:16.127
We see that the thresh hold is 
lower in there and we need less 

07:32:16.128 --> 07:32:19.779
energy and a sounds that can be 
fainter and softer and we will 

07:32:19.780 --> 07:32:21.780
hear them.

07:32:25.072 --> 07:32:27.072
level in around 100 Hertz.

07:32:28.316 --> 07:32:30.316
You will not be able to hear 
that.

07:32:35.635 --> 07:32:36.643
companies use this kind of 
hearing treasure to design their

07:32:36.644 --> 07:32:38.644
equipment.

07:32:41.372 --> 07:32:43.372
MP3 owe CD players, they are 
present.

07:32:44.820 --> 07:32:47.269
O you are tuning a headset, 
speakers, these are really 

07:32:47.270 --> 07:32:49.917
important to know what people 
will actually hear and what they

07:32:51.139 --> 07:32:53.139
are sensitive to.

07:32:58.115 --> 07:33:00.113
So we can have hearing thresh 
hold shifts due to so many 

07:33:00.114 --> 07:33:04.673
circumstances.Let's say the 
noise in the environment.  A 

07:33:04.674 --> 07:33:09.370
minute ago, we have the AC 
blasting a thresh hold shift.  

07:33:09.371 --> 07:33:11.371
We needed to have sounds that 
were way 

07:33:13.464 --> 07:33:15.904
to listen to hear the sounds.  
When they see (inaudible) a 

07:33:15.905 --> 07:33:17.905
minute ago 

07:33:20.219 --> 07:33:22.054
softer and we can hear that our 
thresh hold shifted down at that

07:33:22.055 --> 07:33:24.055
moment.

07:33:26.762 --> 07:33:28.762
a region that will need more 
energy for 

07:33:29.823 --> 07:33:31.823
you to be able to notice that.  
We have other shifts.

07:33:36.165 --> 07:33:37.805
can have shifts that are not as 
broad ban, not all over the 

07:33:37.806 --> 07:33:39.806
spectrum.

07:33:41.062 --> 07:33:43.062
localized.

07:33:45.533 --> 07:33:46.960
This is snowing us a shift -- 
this is showingist a shift 

07:33:46.961 --> 07:33:48.961
around 500 Hertz.

07:33:50.410 --> 07:33:52.410
some noise or some obstruction 
that is 

07:33:53.876 --> 07:33:55.876
not going to allow you to hear 
things around 500 Hertz.

07:33:57.751 --> 07:34:00.196
These shifts can be permanent.  
Or it can be temporary T.

07:34:03.256 --> 07:34:05.256
can be a temporary situation 
disability.

07:34:06.571 --> 07:34:08.799
That means for that period of 
time, you are not going to be 

07:34:08.800 --> 07:34:10.800
able to hear things 

07:34:12.007 --> 07:34:14.007
around those

07:34:16.774 --> 07:34:18.774
not working well, your ears are 
not 

07:34:21.887 --> 07:34:23.324
Sounds below that thresh hold, 
the shifted thresh hold, you're 

07:34:23.325 --> 07:34:27.804
not going to that.  That's the 
important take away from this.  

07:34:27.805 --> 07:34:29.805
If it's below the thresh hold, 
you cannot hear.

07:34:32.103 --> 07:34:34.103
of interest?  Let's say you are 
listening to music 

07:34:38.205 --> 07:34:40.205
someone is speaking or some 
sound that interest you?

07:34:46.770 --> 07:34:49.420
and has energy all over the 
place, but if you notice again 

07:34:49.421 --> 07:34:52.271
around  500 Hertz, a that is 
below the thresh hold, the 

07:34:53.938 --> 07:34:55.938
shifted thresh hold, the blue 
one is going to be lost.

07:34:58.416 --> 07:35:01.271
have a sound of interest that is
below the thresh hold, the 

07:35:01.272 --> 07:35:03.272
shifted thresh 

07:35:06.014 --> 07:35:08.858
difficult to be heard or the 
(inaudible) is really bad.  You 

07:35:08.859 --> 07:35:11.103
cannot understand the sound.is 
the question that everybody is 

07:35:11.104 --> 07:35:19.090
asking.  How can sound amplifier
help us right now?that you ask. 

07:35:19.091 --> 07:35:21.568
Sound amplifier is going to take
the sounds and is going to 

07:35:21.569 --> 07:35:26.046
actually boost you need them the
most.  If we look again in the 

07:35:26.047 --> 07:35:28.047
range from 500 

07:35:31.762 --> 07:35:33.577
sounds and the new process 
sound.  We took the sounds that 

07:35:33.578 --> 07:35:35.578
were really 

07:35:37.048 --> 07:35:38.467
much energy and we boosted them 
all the way over the shifted 

07:35:38.468 --> 07:35:40.507
thresh hold.  So now we can hear
those.

07:35:44.386 --> 07:35:46.888
We took the sounds that were 
already loud and we moved them 

07:35:46.889 --> 07:35:48.889
up but not too up.

07:35:50.595 --> 07:35:54.070
So the loud sounds got  louder 
but not too loud.  So if you see

07:35:54.071 --> 07:35:56.071
the process that 

07:35:57.556 --> 07:36:00.017
it was not uniformed all over 
the spectrum.  It was shifting 

07:36:00.018 --> 07:36:05.131
things and trying to over our 
shifted treasure.  So it was 

07:36:05.132 --> 07:36:07.132
doing a very intelligent boost 
in there.

07:36:10.205 --> 07:36:12.242
are done by the processing 
effect that we introduce in 

07:36:12.243 --> 07:36:14.243
Android P.

07:36:16.516 --> 07:36:18.516
in a minute.  I promise.

07:36:23.733 --> 07:36:25.733
As Brian mentioned, it's the new

07:36:30.574 --> 07:36:33.442
The pre-Q, post Q and what we 
are using this effect, we have 

07:36:33.443 --> 07:36:38.315
two big questions especially for
your sound amplifier.  First is 

07:36:38.316 --> 07:36:40.316
what kind of processing we 

07:36:43.432 --> 07:36:45.432
sounds to be able to depending 
on the needs that we have.

07:36:48.330 --> 07:36:50.330
connection or in an airport or 
depending 

07:36:52.015 --> 07:36:54.234
what kind of processing we need 
to make shifted thresh hold that

07:36:54.235 --> 07:36:56.912
we have.  And the second is how 
users can 

07:37:00.797 --> 07:37:03.424
the right parameters they need 
for you.  So we have two big 

07:37:03.425 --> 07:37:05.425
questions to answer.

07:37:07.694 --> 07:37:11.551
the processing what kind of 
processing we want.  What Google

07:37:11.552 --> 07:37:13.552
is really good at we took 

07:37:14.807 --> 07:37:16.807
and we start crunching that 
data.

07:37:20.294 --> 07:37:22.294
So we took data from hearing 
treasures 

07:37:31.309 --> 07:37:33.309
impaired oozier and we put them 
in there.

07:37:41.310 --> 07:37:43.310
noise obstruction

07:37:47.185 --> 07:37:50.064
in the lender and we went to -- 
tried to get the other content 

07:37:50.065 --> 07:37:52.065
from the other 

07:37:55.016 --> 07:37:57.016
A conversation, movies, music, 
live concerts, lectures.

07:38:02.343 --> 07:38:04.343
together and come up with a set 
of recipes.

07:38:06.003 --> 07:38:11.708
So parameters that will be good 
for sound in many situations.  

07:38:11.709 --> 07:38:13.709
When you do that, you end up 
with -- I 

07:38:15.588 --> 07:38:18.049
a bunch of solutions that are 
pretty much parameters, very 

07:38:18.050 --> 07:38:22.944
complex parameters the dynamics 
of the processor.  For this 

07:38:22.945 --> 07:38:25.594
situation, this will be good to 
shift the sound. situation, it 

07:38:25.595 --> 07:38:27.595
will be that.

07:38:29.070 --> 07:38:31.070
But that is unimagine 
unimaginage.

07:38:33.348 --> 07:38:35.779
parameters and it will be very 
difficult for the users to make 

07:38:35.780 --> 07:38:37.780
something good with this.

07:38:39.655 --> 07:38:41.655
took a step and did some 
dimension reduction.

07:38:46.649 --> 07:38:48.649
dementional space and flattened 
them out.

07:38:50.535 --> 07:38:52.535
In here in the right, can see 
that we 

07:38:54.606 --> 07:38:56.606
those is kind of a formula or 
processing 

07:38:58.677 --> 07:39:00.677
recipe that we want to fit the 
dine amin 

07:39:02.567 --> 07:39:04.393
to change the sound and with the
dimensional functionality, we 

07:39:04.394 --> 07:39:08.896
sound two major (inaudible).tone
and the boost.  The users -- so 

07:39:08.897 --> 07:39:12.153
this solves the second question 
that we have.ares are going to 

07:39:12.154 --> 07:39:15.815
navigate this?  Well, they don't
need is to know all the 

07:39:15.816 --> 07:39:17.816
parameters that we need.

07:39:19.689 --> 07:39:22.322
We give them two sliders that we
saw in the demo and by moving 

07:39:22.323 --> 07:39:24.323
those sliders, 

07:39:26.047 --> 07:39:28.047
doing a very Intel gem mapping 
and going 

07:39:29.370 --> 07:39:32.012
and moving a thousand parameter 
-- not a hundreds of parameters 

07:39:32.013 --> 07:39:34.013
in there.

07:39:35.076 --> 07:39:37.076
When the user goes and iterate 
using 

07:39:39.989 --> 07:39:42.654
actually going through a bunch 
of recipes, a bunch of 

07:39:42.655 --> 07:39:44.655
processings and they 

07:39:46.511 --> 07:39:47.944
suits them the best at that 
moment for the user in that 

07:39:47.945 --> 07:39:49.945
location.  Has what we wanted to
do.

07:39:52.829 --> 07:39:55.284
that was kind of like a bird eye
view of how the sound amplifier 

07:39:55.285 --> 07:40:00.200
works.start talking about code. 
What can you do with the 

07:40:00.201 --> 07:40:02.201
dynamics processing effects.

07:40:08.407 --> 07:40:10.872
the processing effect as a new 
library Android library 

07:40:10.873 --> 07:40:12.873
processing effect.

07:40:14.528 --> 07:40:17.311
talking about use cases.  So 
when can you use a design amices

07:40:20.585 --> 07:40:22.585
processing effect?

07:40:24.282 --> 07:40:26.282
You can do a sound amplifier.  
You go there because this is now

07:40:27.948 --> 07:40:30.175
Android P available preview.  
You can go tonight.

07:40:37.360 --> 07:40:40.002
amplifier.  Win that, we are 
expecting people is 

07:40:43.086 --> 07:40:45.086
to create their own sound 
amplifiers or 

07:40:46.567 --> 07:40:49.207
to be able to hear and listen 
better.  Another example, 

07:40:49.208 --> 07:40:51.208
another month that 

07:40:53.911 --> 07:40:56.162
have a device, an Android device
and you want to tune the 

07:40:56.163 --> 07:40:58.163
speakers or headphones, 

07:41:01.666 --> 07:41:03.492
will equalize or do something to
the headphones to make them 

07:41:03.493 --> 07:41:07.769
sound flattered, base, something
that you want.  Now with this 

07:41:07.770 --> 07:41:12.696
effect, it will be easy 
(inaudible) to do that.  Another

07:41:12.697 --> 07:41:17.565
application that is really  
interesting is the TV remote.You

07:41:17.566 --> 07:41:20.255
are watching TV  2:00 a.m.  You 
can't sleep, but if you start  

07:41:23.298 --> 07:41:25.544
sometimes someone is whispering 
in the movie and immediately, 

07:41:25.545 --> 07:41:27.545
music comes in there.

07:41:30.290 --> 07:41:32.733
really loud and you woke up 
everybody in the house.  You can

07:41:32.734 --> 07:41:34.734
actually have something that 

07:41:37.291 --> 07:41:39.929
whisper, the very soft part of 
the movie can be raised up, but 

07:41:39.930 --> 07:41:44.610
the loud part or happening in 
the movie can bring down and 

07:41:44.611 --> 07:41:46.644
everything will have a more 
level sound in there.

07:41:49.735 --> 07:41:51.970
example can be for media 
players.  You are doing your own

07:41:51.971 --> 07:41:53.971
media player 

07:41:56.239 --> 07:41:59.098
some (inaudible) mastering.  I 
want to listen to classical 

07:41:59.099 --> 07:42:05.612
music in a train.  You would 
like to have the control to be 

07:42:05.613 --> 07:42:07.613
able to again squeeze the loud 
sounds 

07:42:08.859 --> 07:42:10.859
up the soft sounds so everything
is 

07:42:12.789 --> 07:42:14.789
working well for the range you 
have in there.

07:42:18.892 --> 07:42:20.892
I promise (inaudible) is coming.

07:42:23.179 --> 07:42:25.632
power with this effect.  The 
architecture that we show 

07:42:25.633 --> 07:42:29.784
before, we were kind of lying.
little bit more complex.  The 

07:42:29.785 --> 07:42:31.785
architecture yes.  We have four 
stages.

07:42:38.830 --> 07:42:40.078
but we can do more things in 
there.  Inside of each one of 

07:42:40.079 --> 07:42:42.513
those stages, we  that you can 
control.

07:42:47.002 --> 07:42:49.002
We have the bands and in the  
pre-Q 

07:42:50.882 --> 07:42:52.882
have as many bands as you want 
and you 

07:42:54.137 --> 07:42:56.137
can control each one of those 
bands.

07:42:57.598 --> 07:42:59.598
limiter, but you can also 
control that.

07:43:01.839 --> 07:43:03.839
All of these it comes into a 
channel.

07:43:16.799 --> 07:43:18.799
going to have channels here and 
you can 

07:43:31.008 --> 07:43:35.074
can index all of those and say I
want to change the multi-ban 

07:43:31.008 --> 07:43:33.008
controller in the to change 
this.

07:43:35.486 --> 07:43:37.486
We are giving you an API to do 
all the of nose things.

07:43:39.360 --> 07:43:41.792
you notice is the limiters.  The
limiters are linked limiters.

07:43:46.092 --> 07:43:47.714
is important when you are 
talking about both channels to 

07:43:47.715 --> 07:43:55.114
be able to change all if you 
need.  Yes.  We promised code.  

07:43:55.115 --> 07:43:57.115
We have some code.

07:44:00.429 --> 07:44:02.429
dynamics processing effect.

07:44:04.084 --> 07:44:06.936
For this, we decide because we 
have so d to have a config 

07:44:06.937 --> 07:44:11.443
builder.So you create config  
builder and then (inaudible) 

07:44:11.444 --> 07:44:13.444
effect.

07:44:15.104 --> 07:44:17.104
First with a config builder in 
this 

07:44:18.587 --> 07:44:21.464
example, we can have some 
parameters the variant, the 

07:44:21.465 --> 07:44:23.091
(inaudible) of channels.  We 
will talk more about that and 

07:44:23.092 --> 07:44:25.092
then 

07:44:27.376 --> 07:44:32.073
disable each one of the stages. 
In this example, yes.  We want 

07:44:32.074 --> 07:44:34.074
to use pre-Qand limiter.99 of 
bands.

07:44:37.607 --> 07:44:39.607
We can say how many bands we 
want per stage type.

07:44:42.074 --> 07:44:44.074
have 8 bands.

07:44:46.151 --> 07:44:48.151
The multi-band compressor 10 
bands and the (inaudible).

07:44:50.490 --> 07:44:53.821
stage types needs to have the 
same number of bands.that you 

07:44:53.822 --> 07:44:58.496
want.  We have extra parameters 
as I mentioned.  The variant and

07:44:58.497 --> 07:45:00.497
the number of channels 

07:45:01.963 --> 07:45:04.205
the set prefer from the duration
that you can set in the config 

07:45:04.206 --> 07:45:06.206
builder.

07:45:07.674 --> 07:45:10.133
are actually creating a 
configuration.  We are saying 

07:45:10.134 --> 07:45:12.367
build and we have a 
configuration object.

07:45:17.260 --> 07:45:19.701
configuration directly.  
Sometimes I want to finish the 

07:45:24.640 --> 07:45:27.895
of my effect and go and change 
the  default parameters.  In 

07:45:27.896 --> 07:45:29.896
this example, I am getting a 

07:45:30.950 --> 07:45:33.202
a channel act on the first line 
and I'm  saying from channel 

07:45:33.203 --> 07:45:35.203
number 0 in this 

07:45:37.080 --> 07:45:39.080
multi-ban compressor.

07:45:41.992 --> 07:45:43.992
And then I iterate through the 8

07:45:45.245 --> 07:45:47.943
multi-bans that I have and I 
went and  the parameters in each

07:45:47.944 --> 07:45:49.944
one of them.  This is an example
for I/O.

07:45:53.626 --> 07:45:57.128
I am sure you canmore things.  
We can set the ones that we 

07:45:57.129 --> 07:46:02.002
want.  The release, the talk, 
the ratio, the that you want for

07:46:02.003 --> 07:46:04.003
each ones.

07:46:05.283 --> 07:46:08.279
Finally, we go and instance here
the dynamics process

07:46:12.048 --> 07:46:14.505
can (inaudible) with the config 
file that we just created and 

07:46:14.506 --> 07:46:16.506
the session ID.

07:46:21.654 --> 07:46:23.654
this effect to whatever media 
player and 

07:46:24.896 --> 07:46:28.344
those that are of interest for 
and you control everything.I'm 

07:46:28.345 --> 07:46:30.990
going to ins-- instead of going 
on the API just  showing the 

07:46:30.991 --> 07:46:32.991
right code, I 

07:46:34.656 --> 07:46:36.656
more metato show this in 
graphics a little bit.

07:46:40.374 --> 07:46:44.648
are running realtime, we can 
have access just show you.  And 

07:46:44.649 --> 07:46:47.497
we have many channels.  So the 
channel we can index the 

07:46:51.763 --> 07:46:53.763
So 0, 1, 2, 3.

07:46:55.463 --> 07:46:57.287
Each channel object actually has
some parameters like the input 

07:46:57.288 --> 07:46:59.751
gain that you go and change on 
the channel or you have the 

07:46:59.752 --> 07:47:01.752
stages.

07:47:05.065 --> 07:47:07.065
You can access the pre-Q 
multi-brand  or limiter.

07:47:09.558 --> 07:47:11.792
And let's say at this moment in 
AQ, you can grab the AQ and look

07:47:11.793 --> 07:47:13.793
exactly the the  API level.

07:47:17.712 --> 07:47:19.755
API view point and change 
parameters or change the 

07:47:19.756 --> 07:47:22.399
parameters in each one of bans 
there.  Sorry.  It is going very

07:47:22.400 --> 07:47:24.400
deeper.

07:47:26.912 --> 07:47:29.132
We can go from ban to the EQ, 
from the collection of channels.

07:47:31.778 --> 07:47:35.247
So we have access to all the 
(inaudible) we want there.for 

07:47:35.248 --> 07:47:38.118
the multi-ban  compressor.  We 
can access it inside of the 

07:47:38.119 --> 07:47:40.119
channel 

07:47:41.786 --> 07:47:43.786
parameters that we have in each 
one of the bans.

07:47:46.439 --> 07:47:48.439
And lastly, the limiter.

07:47:52.962 --> 07:47:55.252
Now I will dive a little bit 
more on each stage type and what

07:47:55.253 --> 07:47:57.253
are the 

07:47:58.737 --> 07:48:01.391
(inaudible) and getters that we 
have there.  First the 

07:48:01.392 --> 07:48:03.392
equalizer.

07:48:06.695 --> 07:48:08.695
with the equalizer.

07:48:09.934 --> 07:48:11.197
When an equalizer, we will 
specify different frequencies 

07:48:11.198 --> 07:48:13.198
bans.

07:48:16.331 --> 07:48:18.167
0 to 500 Hertz, 500 to 3,000, 
3,000 to 7,000 and we are going 

07:48:18.168 --> 07:48:20.168
to change the 

07:48:22.260 --> 07:48:24.260
gain that we have in each one of
those bans.

07:48:26.153 --> 07:48:28.153
In here, we can is the the bands
any 

07:48:30.491 --> 07:48:34.344
So we can have many bans and 
current frequencies that we.  

07:48:34.345 --> 07:48:36.786
This graph is mislieding because
all bans are the same width.  

07:48:36.787 --> 07:48:38.787
That's not true.  You can do any
wealth that you want.

07:48:43.142 --> 07:48:45.162
up the bans, you can go and with
what we have here, we can get 

07:48:45.163 --> 07:48:47.163
the gain, what is set the gain.

07:48:50.725 --> 07:48:52.725
We can change all of these also 
real  time.

07:48:56.181 --> 07:48:58.181
We are going to then the

07:48:59.303 --> 07:49:01.303
You are only showing one ban in 
the multi-ban compressor.

07:49:04.595 --> 07:49:06.595
ban, but this is -- this is easy
to show 

07:49:07.650 --> 07:49:10.563
what the multi-ban completionor 
does.we have mentioned, when you

07:49:10.564 --> 07:49:13.457
have a compressor, a multi-ban 
compressor, the 

07:49:16.539 --> 07:49:17.954
that are really lewd and main 
them softer and sounds that are 

07:49:17.955 --> 07:49:22.418
very soft and make them louder.
way we have here, we have the 

07:49:22.419 --> 07:49:24.419
same sentence in the before.

07:49:28.382 --> 07:49:30.858
medium and soft in the top.  
After we apply the processing of

07:49:30.859 --> 07:49:32.859
the 

07:49:35.121 --> 07:49:37.785
to look like the after that is 
the loud sound is a little bit 

07:49:37.786 --> 07:49:40.426
softer, the medium the soft one 
goes very loud.

07:49:45.724 --> 07:49:47.724
The way that a multi-ban 
compressor 

07:49:48.775 --> 07:49:51.214
second.  We have the inputs what
is the level 

07:50:02.828 --> 07:50:04.828
from minus 100 to 10.

07:50:06.805 --> 07:50:08.805
The lower the number like

07:50:09.980 --> 07:50:11.980
louder, a louder sound.  And the
compressor what is doing is 

07:50:15.692 --> 07:50:17.517
the input is above the thresh 
hold, we have a thresh hold 

07:50:17.518 --> 07:50:21.182
parameter is going to know, 
that's too loud.  I will bring 

07:50:21.183 --> 07:50:24.844
you down.  But if it happens to 
be below the touched.

07:50:27.888 --> 07:50:30.786
In this graph, it is minus 40.  
The input was minus 40 level.

07:50:36.286 --> 07:50:38.286
We are below the thresh hold.

07:50:42.850 --> 07:50:44.850
We are not going to modify that 
signal.

07:50:49.803 --> 07:50:51.803
So if I choose a value of minus 
20, 

07:50:52.835 --> 07:50:54.835
Let's choose an input of minus 
10.  That's better.

07:50:57.842 --> 07:51:00.687
the output.  That means that the
sound became softer just because

07:51:00.688 --> 07:51:02.688
it was above the thresh hold.

07:51:05.513 --> 07:51:07.967
With all this parameters with 
the compression ratio, thresh 

07:51:07.968 --> 07:51:09.968
hold and the 

07:51:11.850 --> 07:51:14.306
output gain and other 
parameters, we are able to do 

07:51:14.307 --> 07:51:16.307
what we have been promising.

07:51:17.408 --> 07:51:19.452
take sounds and make them 
louder, but take loud sounds and

07:51:19.453 --> 07:51:21.453
make them  softer.

07:51:23.963 --> 07:51:24.977
multi-band compressor is  doing 
and it's doing this in different

07:51:24.978 --> 07:51:26.978
bands.

07:51:29.473 --> 07:51:31.916
frequency from 0 to 1,000 Hertz 
and behave in a different way 

07:51:31.917 --> 07:51:33.917
that the 

07:51:34.972 --> 07:51:36.972
will behave.

07:51:38.254 --> 07:51:40.254
We are giving you all that power
to control.

07:51:45.439 --> 07:51:47.439
of the most complex ones, you 
can get this.

07:51:49.693 --> 07:51:52.148
attack time, release time, 
ratio, all these parameters that

07:51:52.149 --> 07:51:54.149
you need configure 

07:51:57.525 --> 07:51:59.570
do this per bands.  There is one
thing and I'm sure that 

07:52:00.395 --> 07:52:02.395
everybody is asking this.

07:52:04.467 --> 07:52:06.467
pre-game, a post-game.

07:52:08.313 --> 07:52:10.868
If you have a multibrand  
compressor.  It is true.

07:52:16.782 --> 07:52:18.782
pretty much the same.  We talked
to developers and people 

07:52:24.511 --> 07:52:26.328
life and some -- a big portion 
of them really like to have an  

07:52:26.329 --> 07:52:28.329
equalization and 

07:52:29.816 --> 07:52:31.443
multiband compressor to do some 
tuning of microphones and 

07:52:31.444 --> 07:52:33.444
speakers.

07:52:39.011 --> 07:52:41.011
So the easiest way for them to 
make 

07:52:46.126 --> 07:52:48.126
some some redundancy and do the 
API in 

07:52:51.855 --> 07:52:53.855
such a way they can pour all of 
this  into.

07:52:56.970 --> 07:52:58.970
It is the same the multiband 

07:53:01.670 --> 07:53:04.723
And what this is doing is pretty
much the same.  It's taking a 

07:53:04.724 --> 07:53:06.724
sound and if it's way 

07:53:08.025 --> 07:53:10.025
it's above certain levels, it is
going to squash that down.

07:53:16.384 --> 07:53:17.603
found at the end of any all of 
your processing chain.  You 

07:53:17.604 --> 07:53:19.604
don't.

07:53:22.064 --> 07:53:23.103
and the sound is really loud and
you don't they want loud sound 

07:53:23.104 --> 07:53:26.167
to come out of the speakers.you 
go and the limiter is going to 

07:53:26.168 --> 07:53:28.168
say sorry.  This is too  loud.

07:53:30.915 --> 07:53:33.966
will squash it down.  It doesn't
destroy the speakers.  So it is 

07:53:33.967 --> 07:53:39.058
really good.myself something 
about the link.  The limitsers 

07:53:39.059 --> 07:53:41.297
are linked limit or and we have 
the link group.

07:53:45.391 --> 07:53:47.391
When we have multiple channels, 
say we have two channels.

07:53:51.917 --> 07:53:54.155
channel something really loud 
happened in that channel, very, 

07:53:54.156 --> 07:53:56.156
very loud.

07:53:57.626 --> 07:53:59.684
only the left channel.  The 
stereo will shift all the way to

07:54:02.337 --> 07:54:07.677
nothing.  But if they ever 
linked and for some reason one 

07:54:07.678 --> 07:54:09.678
of the channels got a loud  

07:54:11.368 --> 07:54:13.368
both will come down 
simultaneously and 

07:54:15.021 --> 07:54:17.021
the stereo silling

07:54:19.041 --> 07:54:21.041
stereo signal will not move.

07:54:22.133 --> 07:54:24.175
able to control them in a 
multichannel environment, let's 

07:54:24.176 --> 07:54:26.176
say you want to link 

07:54:27.858 --> 07:54:30.489
the surround  speakers in a 
different group so you can keep 

07:54:30.490 --> 07:54:33.586
your spacial image in tact.that 
was another feature that was 

07:54:33.587 --> 07:54:35.835
asked for us to do.

07:54:41.119 --> 07:54:42.947
Some more comments about the 
dynamics  effect.  The real time

07:54:42.948 --> 07:54:44.948
controls.  All the the controls 
that I tried to 

07:54:48.671 --> 07:54:52.590
very big, I will encourage to 
you go in API documentation.  

07:54:52.591 --> 07:54:55.636
All the controls most of them 
are  controls.  You can use them

07:54:55.637 --> 07:54:57.637
and once your affect 

07:54:59.107 --> 07:55:03.179
that you want.  You can change 
levels in here.  You can changed

07:55:03.180 --> 07:55:05.215
attack, the  release, ratio, 
anything that you want this any 

07:55:07.055 --> 07:55:09.055
of the channels in any of the 
bans.

07:55:12.566 --> 07:55:14.418
much the same API for instance, 
sometimes you want to create an 

07:55:14.419 --> 07:55:16.419
effect 

07:55:17.528 --> 07:55:19.766
immediately as soon as it starts
playing.  It is playing with all

07:55:19.767 --> 07:55:23.017
the parameters.like that.  We 
also have some implementations.

07:55:26.505 --> 07:55:28.505
At this moment, we are offering 
two 

07:55:30.377 --> 07:55:32.222
We call favor frequency and 
favor time.  Sometimes for this 

07:55:32.223 --> 07:55:34.223
effects, if you 

07:55:35.279 --> 07:55:37.279
frequency as main 
implementation, it is 

07:55:39.162 --> 07:55:41.162
good because you can have very 
precise 

07:55:42.840 --> 07:55:45.298
need 84 your algorithm and at 
the same time, we are giving the

07:55:45.299 --> 07:55:48.351
desired frame size.can give to 
all your engine to the 

07:55:52.042 --> 07:55:54.042
effect engine to say I like 
frequency 

07:56:08.306 --> 07:56:10.306
forever your processing.

07:56:12.354 --> 07:56:15.149
into AOSB.  So all Android P, 
AOSB is shifting with this 

07:56:15.150 --> 07:56:17.644
effect.effect.

07:56:22.546 --> 07:56:25.199
If an OEM wants to come with 
that implementation, they are 

07:56:25.200 --> 07:56:29.930
encouraged to do that.talk to me
afterwards, but yes.  Go ahead 

07:56:29.931 --> 07:56:31.931
and do this and the only 

07:56:32.986 --> 07:56:34.986
with this.  Very good quality 
effects.

07:56:38.310 --> 07:56:42.615
The were the thing is this 
effect is  as an insert effect. 

07:56:42.616 --> 07:56:45.246
You can go and implement it in 
your application.music 

07:56:45.247 --> 07:56:47.490
application.  You just go and 
use the Android media 

07:56:51.167 --> 07:56:53.394
and all the effects and 
processing and it will be 

07:56:53.395 --> 07:56:55.395
available for in the  
implementation.

07:57:01.391 --> 07:57:03.391
We learnd a bunch ever  things. 
We learned a new feature.

07:57:05.534 --> 07:57:07.534
amplifier.

07:57:11.251 --> 07:57:13.251
It uses only the Smartphone and 
set of headphones.

07:57:17.196 --> 07:57:19.254
cool demos and thank you for the
sound people that turned off the

07:57:19.255 --> 07:57:23.734
AC at that things a little bit 
better.  We learned about the 

07:57:23.735 --> 07:57:25.735
hearing thresh 

07:57:28.432 --> 07:57:30.432
shifts and how these power the 
way that 

07:57:31.483 --> 07:57:33.483
the sound amplifier works.

07:57:34.781 --> 07:57:36.781
dynamics processs effect.  The 
code of how the stages work and 

07:57:42.111 --> 07:57:44.773
dynamics processing effect.  So 
with that, we want to give 

07:57:44.774 --> 07:57:46.774
thanks 

07:57:48.434 --> 07:57:50.434
involved in this project.

07:57:51.681 --> 07:57:53.681
Brian, the accessibility team, 
my 

07:57:55.577 --> 07:57:57.577
team at Google, the sound 
understanding 

07:58:00.894 --> 07:58:02.894
team, our team in TAIPEI that 
helped 

07:58:03.985 --> 07:58:06.447
anticipation you saw today and I
want to help you for staying on 

07:58:06.448 --> 07:58:10.714
the last day of I/O. us if you 
have any  questions.  Thank you.
