00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:01.739
- [Instructor] In this video
we're going to introduce

00:00:01.739 --> 00:00:05.871
ourselves to the idea of adding decimals.

00:00:05.871 --> 00:00:08.624
And I encourage you as we
work through these problems

00:00:08.624 --> 00:00:10.005
to keep pausing the video

00:00:10.005 --> 00:00:12.188
and seeing if you can
think about it on your own

00:00:12.188 --> 00:00:13.916
before we work through it together.

00:00:13.916 --> 00:00:16.321
Now we're going to build up
slowly, and in future videos

00:00:16.321 --> 00:00:18.718
we're gonna find out
faster ways of doing it.

00:00:18.718 --> 00:00:21.672
But the way we're learning it
in this video in the next view

00:00:21.672 --> 00:00:24.634
is to really make sure we
understand what is happening.

00:00:24.634 --> 00:00:28.587
So let's say we wanted to add 0.1 to 0.8.

00:00:28.587 --> 00:00:31.878
Or you could say we're
adding 1/10 to 8/10.

00:00:31.878 --> 00:00:35.547
Pause this video and see
if you can figure that out.

00:00:35.547 --> 00:00:38.682
Well there's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:00:38.682 --> 00:00:42.849
You could say, hey look 0.1, that is 1/10,

00:00:44.027 --> 00:00:46.777
and 0.8, that is 8/10.

00:00:49.572 --> 00:00:51.081
And so if I have one of something

00:00:51.081 --> 00:00:53.426
and I add eight more of that something,

00:00:53.426 --> 00:00:56.155
so I have 1/10, and I'm
gonna add eight more tenths,

00:00:56.155 --> 00:00:59.658
well I'm gonna end up with
nine of that something,

00:00:59.658 --> 00:01:01.743
in this case we're talking about tenths.

00:01:01.743 --> 00:01:05.420
So that is going to be equal to 9/10.

00:01:05.420 --> 00:01:07.067
That's one way to think about it.

00:01:07.067 --> 00:01:09.755
Another way, we could
think about it visually.

00:01:09.755 --> 00:01:12.780
So let's say we take a whole,
and we were to divide it

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.027
into tenths, which we
have right over here.

00:01:15.027 --> 00:01:16.865
So if we say this whole square is a whole,

00:01:16.865 --> 00:01:19.384
we divide it into 10 equal sections.

00:01:19.384 --> 00:01:22.507
So each of these white bars
you can view as a tenth.

00:01:22.507 --> 00:01:26.890
So we have 1/10, so let me fill that in.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:30.442
So 1/10, woops that's
not what I wanted to do.

00:01:30.442 --> 00:01:32.267
We have 1/10 right over there.

00:01:32.267 --> 00:01:34.437
And to that we want to add 8/10.

00:01:34.437 --> 00:01:36.520
So one, two, three, four,

00:01:37.979 --> 00:01:39.979
five, six, seven, eight.

00:01:41.988 --> 00:01:45.571
And so how many total
tenths do I now have?

00:01:46.616 --> 00:01:48.415
Well let's just count 'em up.

00:01:48.415 --> 00:01:49.964
We have this one here.

00:01:49.964 --> 00:01:52.297
One, two, three, four, five,

00:01:53.316 --> 00:01:55.924
six, seven, eight, nine.

00:01:55.924 --> 00:01:57.357
These are really saying the same thing.

00:01:57.357 --> 00:01:59.962
All of this together, is going to be,

00:01:59.962 --> 00:02:00.795
let me do that a little neater.

00:02:00.795 --> 00:02:05.174
All of this together is going to be 9/10.

00:02:05.174 --> 00:02:09.333
Now in either case, how do we
write 9/10 in decimal form?

00:02:09.333 --> 00:02:11.922
Well we go to the tenth's place,

00:02:11.922 --> 00:02:15.736
which is one space on the
right side of the decimal.

00:02:15.736 --> 00:02:17.936
We say hey we have 9/10.

00:02:17.936 --> 00:02:20.030
This is the tenth's space right over here.

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:21.813
So that's just saying we have 9/10.

00:02:21.813 --> 00:02:25.563
We have nine of these
tenths right over here.

00:02:26.528 --> 00:02:28.445
So let's keep building.

00:02:29.651 --> 00:02:32.539
Let's do another example.

00:02:32.539 --> 00:02:36.706
So let's say that we, let
me clear all of this out.

00:02:38.544 --> 00:02:42.089
So let's say that we want to add,

00:02:42.089 --> 00:02:44.597
do these with different colors.

00:02:44.597 --> 00:02:46.930
So let's say we want to add,

00:02:48.417 --> 00:02:51.152
I have trouble because
my pen isn't working.

00:02:51.152 --> 00:02:51.985
Let's see.

00:02:53.097 --> 00:02:55.347
Let's say we want to add...

00:02:58.229 --> 00:03:00.139
My pen is, oh here we go.

00:03:00.139 --> 00:03:04.620
Let's say we want to
add 3/10, and to that,

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:07.203
we want to add 9/10.

00:03:09.304 --> 00:03:11.387
What is that going to be?

00:03:12.555 --> 00:03:14.796
Well you could use the same idea.

00:03:14.796 --> 00:03:17.918
If you say this is 3/10,

00:03:17.918 --> 00:03:22.085
and this is 9/10, plus 9/10,

00:03:23.114 --> 00:03:24.232
well if I have three of something

00:03:24.232 --> 00:03:27.225
and I add nine of them,
well that's going to be 12.

00:03:27.225 --> 00:03:28.400
Three plus nine is 12.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:33.173
So we could say this is
going to be equal to 12/10.

00:03:33.173 --> 00:03:35.653
Now this one might be a
little bit counterintuitive.

00:03:35.653 --> 00:03:38.884
12/10, what does that mean?

00:03:38.884 --> 00:03:40.233
Well one way to think about it,

00:03:40.233 --> 00:03:42.316
this is 10/10,

00:03:44.958 --> 00:03:46.708
plus 2/10.

00:03:48.434 --> 00:03:51.124
And what are 10/10?

00:03:51.124 --> 00:03:55.878
Well if I have 10/10, this
right over here is one whole.

00:03:55.878 --> 00:03:57.620
So that is going to be one.

00:03:57.620 --> 00:04:00.151
So we have one and 2/10.

00:04:00.151 --> 00:04:03.703
So how do we write one and 2/10?

00:04:03.703 --> 00:04:06.478
Well we could write it
as in the one's place,

00:04:06.478 --> 00:04:08.051
we just write a one.

00:04:08.051 --> 00:04:13.013
And then in the tenth's
place, we write our 2/10.

00:04:13.013 --> 00:04:15.871
So you could say it's equal to 1.2,

00:04:15.871 --> 00:04:19.458
or you could say it's
equal to one and 2/10,

00:04:19.458 --> 00:04:22.974
which is the same thing as 12/10.

00:04:22.974 --> 00:04:24.532
Now if we want to see that visually,

00:04:24.532 --> 00:04:27.565
let's get our diagram out again.

00:04:27.565 --> 00:04:29.569
So actually I'm gonna
put two of these here.

00:04:29.569 --> 00:04:32.069
So one, and then a second one.

00:04:33.604 --> 00:04:38.318
And we want to add, so
let's start with the 3/10.

00:04:38.318 --> 00:04:42.178
So let me color these in really fast.

00:04:42.178 --> 00:04:44.237
Use that light blue color.

00:04:44.237 --> 00:04:46.237
That is 1/10.

00:04:47.929 --> 00:04:50.531
This is 2/10.

00:04:50.531 --> 00:04:52.390
Just coloring 'em in really fast.

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:55.019
And this is 3/10.

00:04:55.019 --> 00:04:58.837
And then to that we're gonna add 9/10.

00:04:58.837 --> 00:05:01.420
So to that we're gonna add one,

00:05:04.046 --> 00:05:04.879
two,

00:05:07.168 --> 00:05:08.001
three.

00:05:09.408 --> 00:05:11.047
I'm not coloring them in fully.

00:05:11.047 --> 00:05:12.964
Four, you get the idea.

00:05:14.371 --> 00:05:15.954
Five, almost there.

00:05:17.223 --> 00:05:18.056
Six.

00:05:19.104 --> 00:05:20.066
I need to color faster.

00:05:20.066 --> 00:05:20.899
Seven.

00:05:22.766 --> 00:05:23.599
Seven.

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:25.423
Eight.

00:05:28.894 --> 00:05:30.217
Nine.

00:05:30.217 --> 00:05:31.050
So there you have it.

00:05:31.050 --> 00:05:32.967
I have added 9/10.

00:05:32.967 --> 00:05:35.202
You notice I've colored in nine,

00:05:35.202 --> 00:05:37.782
I've colored in yellow,
nine of the tenths,

00:05:37.782 --> 00:05:40.794
and before I had three
of the tenths colored in.

00:05:40.794 --> 00:05:42.843
And when you add 'em all
together, what happens?

00:05:42.843 --> 00:05:46.495
Well the 3/10 plus the
7/10 right over here,

00:05:46.495 --> 00:05:48.259
they made a whole.

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:51.176
So this right over here is our one.

00:05:52.236 --> 00:05:56.082
And then we also have
another 2/10 left over.

00:05:56.082 --> 00:06:00.249
And so this is where,
this is our 0.2, or 2/10.

00:06:01.687 --> 00:06:05.854
So it's gonna be one
plus 2/10, which is 1.2.

00:06:06.893 --> 00:06:08.107
So hopefully this gives you a good sense

00:06:08.107 --> 00:06:10.104
of how we think about adding decimals.

00:06:10.104 --> 00:06:11.184
And even though in the future

00:06:11.184 --> 00:06:13.350
we're gonna figure out
faster ways of doing it,

00:06:13.350 --> 00:06:15.666
or more systematic ways of doing it,

00:06:15.666 --> 00:06:18.055
this is still the way that
I still do it in my head

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:19.378
if someone walks up to me on the street

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.839
and says hey, add 0.3 to 0.9.

00:06:21.839 --> 00:06:24.256
That's how I think about it.
