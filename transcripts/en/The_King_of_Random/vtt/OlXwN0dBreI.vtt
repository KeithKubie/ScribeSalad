00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.220
Hey guys, I'm Nate welcome back to the workshop in the past

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.079
We've done a few different experiments casting candy into some different shapes we did grant and my thumb

00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:13.649
We did a giant turkey out of melted Jolly Ranchers, and we also made some silver play buttons cast in candy well today

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:15.179
We're going to try something a little different

00:00:15.179 --> 00:00:20.099
All of those previous experiments have been solid candy all the way through when they were cast today

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.960
I wanted to try something a little bit different

00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:27.359
It's called slush casting or rotation casting the basic idea is we'll whip up a batch of our hard candy

00:00:27.359 --> 00:00:31.499
And then we've got two of these things which you might recognize as our pokeball molds now

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:35.159
I'm not going to try and make a solid pokeball of candy that would weigh about a pound

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:40.199
You'd be almost impossible to eat and it'd kind of be a waste of candy so what we are gonna try and do is

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:43.980
See if we can pour the liquid candy down into the mold and then

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:48.209
Rotate it around to coat all of the sides of the mold as the candy cools off

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:50.700
Hopefully the result will be a hollow

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:55.199
Pokeball made out of candy here are the supplies that we're going to need to try this experiment

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:00.419
We're gonna need some corn syrup some white sugar a pot to cook everything in our flavoring and food coloring

00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:02.199
and of course the pokeball molds

00:01:02.199 --> 00:01:06.419
It's also important to make sure you have a working candy thermometer to get the temperature right as you're cooking

00:01:06.549 --> 00:01:11.849
We have everything ready. Let's get some candy cooking on the stove this candy recipe is very basic. It's two cups of white sugar

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:14.400
2/3 cups corn syrup and

00:01:14.650 --> 00:01:18.929
3/4 cups of water there we have it all three of our ingredients in the pot

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.569
I'm just doing a little bit of mixing and then I'm gonna put it on the stove

00:01:23.619 --> 00:01:28.619
Over medium heat stir the mixture with a heat-safe spatula until all of the sugar is dissolved

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.630
Once your sugar is completely dissolved

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:36.159
It's time to stop stirring

00:01:36.159 --> 00:01:40.739
the candy thermometer should be attached to the side of the pot in such a way that the bottom of the

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:42.570
Thermometer is in the candy mixture

00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:44.200
But not touching the walls

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:48.630
Or the bottom of the pot it will take some time for your candy to heat up to the right temperature

00:01:48.759 --> 00:01:54.569
But just be patient make sure you watch the candy thermometer well so that you don't accidentally burn it

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:56.250
While our candy is cooking

00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.029
I just want to prep our molds really quickly these are two part molds that come apart completely

00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.589
So I'm just gonna wrap some rubber bands around them to hold them nice and closed when we pour in the candy

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:07.110
once our candy mixture hits

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:09.600
260 degrees Fahrenheit, it's time to add some food coloring

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:11.070
But still don't stir it

00:02:11.070 --> 00:02:17.219
Let the boiling action of the sugar do that for you the moment your candy hits 300 degrees Fahrenheit?

00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:21.779
you need to remove it from the heat at this point our candy is completely cooked and

00:02:22.030 --> 00:02:25.410
We're just gonna let it cool down a little bit to let some of the bubbles disappear

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:27.779
Before we pour it into our pokeball molds

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:31.679
And as we let it cool down just a bit to get all the bubbles out. We're gonna add our flavor

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:48.699
And so I'm just kind of guessing how much I'm going to need I haven't tried this before so I'm not exactly sure how well

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:49.760
It'll work

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:54.999
Got our hot handy down inside the mold now. I'm just gonna try and rotate it evenly

00:02:55.610 --> 00:02:59.649
So it coats everything as it cools down put this plate under me

00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.770
So if it spills out and mouth doesn't get all over the counter

00:03:04.210 --> 00:03:06.210
It was starting a spill

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:10.569
So at this point everything that I can see inside the mold is nice and well coated

00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:16.570
I just have to hope that the parts that I can't see the very edge near the opening of the mold are also well coated

00:03:16.670 --> 00:03:18.230
Kind hard as hell

00:03:18.230 --> 00:03:21.099
Also, we've got these nice little slivers of candy

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:26.649
I'm gonna take my mold and while the candy has mostly cooled off. It is still

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:29.710
running very very slowly inside

00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:33.460
So I'm just gonna take this and set it upside down so if there is any extra

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.740
It will run out the mouth onto the plate, and it won't pool too much anywhere inside the mold now

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.649
I'm just gonna take the rest of the candy and pour it into this one

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:51.190
You're doing a slush casting or rotation casting as is also called

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:56.080
It's important to keep it moving pretty much the whole time so that it coats it evenly inside

00:03:56.930 --> 00:03:59.890
Candy is going to be a little bit different than most types of things

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:04.690
I've done slush casting with them before I've used several different types of resin in molds like this to make

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:12.070
Little props or pieces of costumes and stuff like that this is definitely different, but I'm hoping the principles will work out the same way

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:15.729
That's looking pretty good. I'm gonna do the same thing with this one

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:19.629
We're just gonna turn it upside down on a plate if there is any excess. It'll drain out

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.959
And we'll hope it cools down nicely

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:27.429
To help him cool down. I'm just gonna pop them into the fridge

00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:33.070
Alright, we've got the pokéballs cooling down in the refrigerator and while that happens

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.040
I actually have something else that I want to try slush casting

00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:39.729
It's gonna be a little bit of a surprise when I reveal it to see what it is

00:04:39.729 --> 00:04:45.219
I've made if you have any guesses about what this is before I cast it. Let us know down in the comments

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:51.609
No cheating and watching the whole video and then commenting what it actually is. Yeah guess first and then watch

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.060
I'll start mixing up another batch of candy and get it cooking

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:07.319
Oh, yeah absolutely good

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:16.919
It's a little messy in a couple spots but most part

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.190
I'm liking how that looks

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.740
And tastes

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:27.130
Very warm in there

00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.230
little bits of the candy are still like

00:05:29.660 --> 00:05:34.360
Soft enough for they're kind of slumping inside their you know I have a different idea

00:05:34.750 --> 00:05:37.870
So this freezer for whatever reason has a whole lot of old?

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.750
frozen bananas in it and while I certainly wouldn't want to eat them I

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:45.939
Think they will work to help cool down what I'm casting here, so I'm just gonna kind of fill this

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.290
cavity

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:50.290
with some frozen bananas

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:52.510
Just as ice packs

00:05:55.419 --> 00:05:57.419
One of the strangest things I've ever done

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.110
Yep full of bananas

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.819
Trash cans just hold that upright as it cools down and once it's cooled down all the way

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:09.870
We'll try and de mold it and see if it turned out. Let's see if the pokeballs have finished

00:06:15.400 --> 00:06:20.939
You definitely had some extra sugar in this one kind of pour it out and left a little puddle on the plate

00:06:21.850 --> 00:06:27.270
Feels pretty nice and cool and rigid inside so I think we're good this one. Oh this one

00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:29.490
Also had a little bit of a looks like a weird

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:36.360
Boozy slug tongue or something I don't know see if we can de mold these without destroying them that might be the real question

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:37.990
I don't know how thick

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:42.210
The candy will have built up on the walls, so maybe it's thick enough that it will hold itself together

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:46.169
And maybe it'll just shatter apart as I try and open it to be a real shame

00:06:50.470 --> 00:06:52.890
Don't hear any shattering noise. It's good sign Oh

00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:58.680
Beautiful

00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:03.720
Yes

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.760
Oh

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:09.780
It's fantastic. Let's try the other one I

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:14.969
Think there was less candy in this one. So it might even be a little thinner

00:07:22.199 --> 00:07:24.199
If yes

00:07:28.809 --> 00:07:30.699
Hah

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:32.559
Look at that

00:07:32.559 --> 00:07:34.559
hard candy pokin oh

00:07:35.409 --> 00:07:39.959
That's fantastic. I'm gonna get a pair of pliers and see if I can break off the little

00:07:40.779 --> 00:07:45.629
Tumors going on the back of these things all right, so I want to get this separate chunk of candy off

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:49.408
But I don't want to shatter the rest of pokeball. I don't know how fragile it is

00:07:49.409 --> 00:07:52.438
I don't think we need to see but I can break off a little piece of it I

00:07:53.259 --> 00:07:55.259
Should come off really nicely

00:07:57.309 --> 00:08:04.019
All right that actually worked pretty well better than I thought it would ha there's one see about this other one Oh

00:08:05.469 --> 00:08:09.659
See that's what I was kind of worried about it broke into the body of the pokeball just a little bit. It's not bad

00:08:09.659 --> 00:08:15.239
It's definitely not ruined. It's not quite as clean as I was hoping so there we go to hollow

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:22.680
Candy pokey balls picked up pretty good detail there were a couple spots where the candy didn't cast beautifully into the mold

00:08:23.379 --> 00:08:25.229
We've got these little bubbles and of course

00:08:25.229 --> 00:08:32.638
There's also some surface bubbles all over the outside of it, but for the most part BAM. It's pretty dang good. I think

00:08:33.250 --> 00:08:37.799
When we cast our Thanksgiving turkey lollipop it had sort of a flat outside color

00:08:37.810 --> 00:08:40.260
But hitting with a blowtorch really helped smooth it out

00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:44.909
I'm gonna see if I can do something similar with the pokey balls to see if they get a little bit more transparent

00:08:48.060 --> 00:08:50.060
That's working pretty good, I think

00:08:52.980 --> 00:08:57.859
Alright, I definitely think that helped a little bit, you can see that this one is now more clear

00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:02.330
You can see down through it pretty nicely. There's still lots of bubbles in the way well

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:04.369
I think that worked well enough. I'm going to do it on the other one too

00:09:10.430 --> 00:09:15.729
You would be cooler of course if I could make the candy match the color of the pokeball in all the different spots

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.039
But slush casting doesn't really let you choose

00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:20.620
What color goes where it's sort of a 1 in color goes everywhere?

00:09:20.620 --> 00:09:26.889
And then if you want to color it afterward you do that I might have to do some research into how to paint sugar

00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:33.380
How bad

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:37.029
It's not painting it, but you know it tastes good. I've actually got this little

00:09:37.700 --> 00:09:39.530
Charizard keychain thing

00:09:39.530 --> 00:09:44.230
And I want to open up the bottom of one of these pokeballs just enough that I can fit this inside there

00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:46.570
Just because I think that would look really cool

00:09:47.330 --> 00:09:49.330
haha

00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:52.480
Well there we go

00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:00.579
Think our casting has cooled down enough that it's rigid, and I can now take it out of the mold

00:10:00.590 --> 00:10:03.519
So I'm just gonna take the bananas out of it like you do

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.820
Here goes

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:21.010
At this point some of you might be able to figure out what it is unmaking

00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:27.970
Ha ha it's working

00:10:32.870 --> 00:10:36.549
It worked a candy Iron Man helmet

00:10:39.410 --> 00:10:42.339
Sweet that is beautiful oh

00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:44.330
man

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.330
Tony Stark only wishes

00:10:47.030 --> 00:10:49.030
alright there we go a

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:51.260
100%

00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.910
Candy Iron Man helmet this is fully to scale

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:58.779
So many years ago, I made myself an Iron Man costume

00:10:58.970 --> 00:11:03.129
And that involves sculpting molding and casting a helmet

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:07.270
So I still have the mold which is what I've been using and I'd cleaned it out really well

00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:09.879
and then I cast candy into it and

00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:15.309
Now I have a candy Iron Man helmet, and I want to put it on but unfortunately

00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.140
I don't think my head will actually fit in this design is meant to have a piece of it

00:11:20.330 --> 00:11:22.330
Removable to put it over your head

00:11:24.890 --> 00:11:30.129
No like that's that's as far as I get right there sadly very sadly I

00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:35.500
Can't actually wear this Iron Man. Helmet. Maybe if I had a head much much smaller than

00:11:36.290 --> 00:11:42.229
I'd be able to so like a small child might be able to get this on might be worth looking into is weird

00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:44.870
But it's made of candy

00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:46.940
So I got a lick it

00:11:47.279 --> 00:11:49.279
I'm sorry Tony, sorry

00:11:53.610 --> 00:11:55.610
That's delicious

00:11:56.850 --> 00:12:00.290
Alright guys this has been an excellent experiment learning if we can do slush casting or

00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:05.029
Rotational casting using a candy recipe and it worked surprisingly well

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.969
We've got our two pokeballs, and we have our candy Iron Man helmet, and they all work great

00:12:10.970 --> 00:12:15.110
There are little difficulties of course tiny bits of cracking bubbles in the surface

00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:21.950
But overall this definitely works as a casting material, and it's delightful. It looks really cool

00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:26.239
It's probably the best-tasting thing you could probably use as a slush casting material

00:12:26.240 --> 00:12:29.659
I was a little bit afraid that they would just sort of shatter when they're cooling down

00:12:30.300 --> 00:12:33.919
Structurally speaking melted sugar is fairly similar to melted glass

00:12:34.459 --> 00:12:34.970
They are both

00:12:34.970 --> 00:12:41.180
What's called an amorphous solid which means they form a non crystalline lattice structure as they cool down and?

00:12:41.550 --> 00:12:46.099
glass if you were to try and cast like this one thing it wouldn't stick to the walls at all

00:12:46.320 --> 00:12:50.570
And another as it was cooling down if you don't put it in a kiln and very slowly cool it down

00:12:50.570 --> 00:12:54.469
It would definitely crack, so I was a little bit worried that the sugar would do the same thing

00:12:54.470 --> 00:12:59.240
But this has worked quite well coming from a prop in costume making background

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:00.800
That's just a really fun thing to try

00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:05.449
I've done several slush castings with different types of resin, but this is a new frontier for me

00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:09.169
Thank you guys for joining us for this project today, and we look forward to the next one talk to you then

00:13:10.529 --> 00:13:14.328
Now you can go out and catch all of the candy pokemon that are running around your neighborhood
