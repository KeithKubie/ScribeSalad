well it's again because of the support

00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:09.950
well it's again because of the support
 

00:09:09.950 --> 00:09:13.090
well it's again because of the support

having a need that you wanted to have
 

00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.960

fulfilled and then building an app that

00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:45.970
fulfilled and then building an app that
 

00:13:45.970 --> 00:13:47.730

that they want to solve from themselves
 

00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.280
that they want to solve from themselves
and so they build an app which does that

00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:53.290
and so they build an app which does that
 

00:13:53.290 --> 00:13:54.870
and so they build an app which does that
and I think that's a great way of

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:54.880

something to look at I think that's

00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:46.270
something to look at I think that's
 

00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:47.820
something to look at I think that's
going to definitely the biggest piece of

00:17:47.820 --> 00:17:47.830
going to definitely the biggest piece of
 

00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:48.840
going to definitely the biggest piece of

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:48.850

going to let you hide away these refresh
 

00:17:55.120 --> 00:17:57.210
going to let you hide away these refresh
buttons so I think that would be a

00:17:57.210 --> 00:17:57.220

well I just noticed that the 3d effect

00:18:30.530 --> 00:18:30.540
well I just noticed that the 3d effect
 

00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:33.180
well I just noticed that the 3d effect
here and I wonder if that's if that's

00:18:33.180 --> 00:18:33.190
here and I wonder if that's if that's
 

00:18:33.190 --> 00:18:35.159
here and I wonder if that's if that's
the AOSP implementation or did you do

00:18:35.159 --> 00:18:35.169
the AOSP implementation or did you do
 

00:18:35.169 --> 00:18:38.370
the AOSP implementation or did you do
that yourself notice it's simple page

00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:56.690
I like a lot I think it's particularly
 

00:21:56.690 --> 00:22:00.010
I like a lot I think it's particularly
helpful is if you do have empty space in

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:00.020
helpful is if you do have empty space in
 

00:22:00.020 --> 00:22:02.919
helpful is if you do have empty space in
your list what you can do is put the

00:22:02.919 --> 00:22:02.929
your list what you can do is put the
 

00:22:02.929 --> 00:22:05.649
your list what you can do is put the
outline of another item which then if

00:22:05.649 --> 00:22:05.659
outline of another item which then if
 

00:22:05.659 --> 00:22:07.779
outline of another item which then if
you press it it will take you to the add

00:22:07.779 --> 00:22:07.789
you press it it will take you to the add
 

00:22:07.789 --> 00:22:11.320
you press it it will take you to the add
page you know so because that's the

00:22:11.320 --> 00:22:11.330
page you know so because that's the
 

00:22:11.330 --> 00:22:13.659
page you know so because that's the
thing is when I look at these a sock you

00:22:13.659 --> 00:22:13.669
thing is when I look at these a sock you
 

00:22:13.669 --> 00:22:15.610
thing is when I look at these a sock you
know the first thing I think is how do I

00:22:15.610 --> 00:22:15.620
know the first thing I think is how do I
 

00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.770
know the first thing I think is how do I
get more things into this list and if

00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:17.780
get more things into this list and if
 

00:22:17.780 --> 00:22:21.430
get more things into this list and if
the button is right there it's very

00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:21.440
the button is right there it's very
 

00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:24.399
the button is right there it's very
intuitive as opposed to you know down

00:22:24.399 --> 00:22:24.409
intuitive as opposed to you know down
 

00:22:24.409 --> 00:22:27.100
intuitive as opposed to you know down
here in the corner where it's certainly

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:27.110
here in the corner where it's certainly
 

00:22:27.110 --> 00:22:30.000
here in the corner where it's certainly
visible but just not as into it

00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:30.010
visible but just not as into it
 

00:22:30.010 --> 00:22:32.560
visible but just not as into it
otherwise it like I said really really

00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:32.570
otherwise it like I said really really
 

00:22:32.570 --> 00:22:35.049
otherwise it like I said really really
nice that you click through you have the

00:22:35.049 --> 00:22:35.059
nice that you click through you have the
 

00:22:35.059 --> 00:22:38.440
nice that you click through you have the
the stock details here nice again custom

00:22:38.440 --> 00:22:38.450
the stock details here nice again custom
 

00:22:38.450 --> 00:22:41.169
the stock details here nice again custom
graph which you know shows the stalk

00:22:41.169 --> 00:22:41.179
graph which you know shows the stalk
 

00:22:41.179 --> 00:22:43.930
graph which you know shows the stalk
much better over that time frame and

00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:43.940
much better over that time frame and
 

00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:45.340
much better over that time frame and
then you can click again further through

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:45.350
then you can click again further through
 

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:46.600
then you can click again further through
and I quite like this because you can

00:22:46.600 --> 00:22:46.610
and I quite like this because you can
 

00:22:46.610 --> 00:22:50.890
and I quite like this because you can
actually annotate the graph and and save

00:22:50.890 --> 00:22:50.900
actually annotate the graph and and save
 

00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:54.279
actually annotate the graph and and save
that and and even share using the

00:22:54.279 --> 00:22:54.289
that and and even share using the
 

00:22:54.289 --> 00:22:56.980
that and and even share using the
standard share intent which is all

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:56.990
standard share intent which is all
 

00:22:56.990 --> 00:22:59.890
standard share intent which is all
really really nice one thing I did

00:22:59.890 --> 00:22:59.900
really really nice one thing I did
 

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:01.720
really really nice one thing I did
notice obviously you have the ability to

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:01.730
notice obviously you have the ability to
 

00:23:01.730 --> 00:23:03.789
notice obviously you have the ability to
zoom in and out using the you know the

00:23:03.789 --> 00:23:03.799
zoom in and out using the you know the
 

00:23:03.799 --> 00:23:05.560
zoom in and out using the you know the
buttons at the top I was kind of always

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:05.570
buttons at the top I was kind of always
 

00:23:05.570 --> 00:23:09.029
buttons at the top I was kind of always
looking to zoom and pan left or right

00:23:09.029 --> 00:23:09.039
looking to zoom and pan left or right
 

00:23:09.039 --> 00:23:12.370
looking to zoom and pan left or right
you know within within this so it's kind

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:12.380
you know within within this so it's kind
 

00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.899
you know within within this so it's kind
of screaming out for a gesture of some

00:23:13.899 --> 00:23:13.909
of screaming out for a gesture of some
 

00:23:13.909 --> 00:23:16.299
of screaming out for a gesture of some
kind and I think we actually have an

00:23:16.299 --> 00:23:16.309
kind and I think we actually have an
 

00:23:16.309 --> 00:23:18.700
kind and I think we actually have an
Android training class around gesture

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:18.710
Android training class around gesture
 

00:23:18.710 --> 00:23:20.230
Android training class around gesture
support so maybe we're dressing a look

00:23:20.230 --> 00:23:20.240
support so maybe we're dressing a look
 

00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.110
support so maybe we're dressing a look
at that considering it I've built so

00:23:23.110 --> 00:23:23.120
at that considering it I've built so
 

00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.210
at that considering it I've built so
many graph implementations and so many

00:23:25.210 --> 00:23:25.220
many graph implementations and so many
 

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:26.620
many graph implementations and so many
different program languages over the

00:23:26.620 --> 00:23:26.630
different program languages over the
 

00:23:26.630 --> 00:23:28.630
different program languages over the
years so I know how much of a pain it is

00:23:28.630 --> 00:23:28.640
years so I know how much of a pain it is
 

00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:30.700
years so I know how much of a pain it is
to implement that sort of second level

00:23:30.700 --> 00:23:30.710
to implement that sort of second level
 

00:23:30.710 --> 00:23:33.789
to implement that sort of second level
of zooming and panning so not a p0 not a

00:23:33.789 --> 00:23:33.799
of zooming and panning so not a p0 not a
 

00:23:33.799 --> 00:23:35.990
of zooming and panning so not a p0 not a
high high priority bug certainly the

00:23:35.990 --> 00:23:36.000
high high priority bug certainly the
 

00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:38.810
high high priority bug certainly the
faster more efficient updates is more

00:23:38.810 --> 00:23:38.820
faster more efficient updates is more
 

00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:40.850
faster more efficient updates is more
important but as a nit picky thing which

00:23:40.850 --> 00:23:40.860
important but as a nit picky thing which
 

00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:42.590
important but as a nit picky thing which
might be really nice you know I don't

00:23:42.590 --> 00:23:42.600
might be really nice you know I don't
 

00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:44.270
might be really nice you know I don't
think I've seen any stuff that's a lot

00:23:44.270 --> 00:23:44.280
think I've seen any stuff that's a lot
 

00:23:44.280 --> 00:23:46.220
think I've seen any stuff that's a lot
too because do that I've built many

00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:46.230
too because do that I've built many
 

00:23:46.230 --> 00:23:47.540
too because do that I've built many
graph layer that I think it's actually

00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:47.550
graph layer that I think it's actually
 

00:23:47.550 --> 00:23:49.730
graph layer that I think it's actually
very easy well Jim you back yes we all

00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:49.740
very easy well Jim you back yes we all
 

00:23:49.740 --> 00:23:54.470
very easy well Jim you back yes we all
know who's a better program so yeah see

00:23:54.470 --> 00:23:54.480
know who's a better program so yeah see
 

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.120

thing that I I think we have to point
 

00:24:05.250 --> 00:24:07.130
thing that I I think we have to point
out and I don't know how well it comes

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:07.140
out and I don't know how well it comes
 

00:24:07.140 --> 00:24:09.770
out and I don't know how well it comes
out in the video is just how fast this

00:24:09.770 --> 00:24:09.780

quick and I put a lot of effort to make

00:24:15.350 --> 00:24:15.360
quick and I put a lot of effort to make
 

00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:17.540
quick and I put a lot of effort to make
it fast yeah and it's paid off like you

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:17.550
it fast yeah and it's paid off like you

know project but a big part of what we

00:24:19.730 --> 00:24:19.740
know project but a big part of what we
 

00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:21.800
know project but a big part of what we
do with the framework now trying to get

00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:21.810
do with the framework now trying to get

done we'd love to if if you I do get a

00:24:45.770 --> 00:24:45.780
done we'd love to if if you I do get a
 

00:24:45.780 --> 00:24:47.030
done we'd love to if if you I do get a
chance to implement the google cloud

00:24:47.030 --> 00:24:47.040
chance to implement the google cloud
 

00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:48.830

messaging we'd love to hear about that

00:24:48.830 --> 00:24:48.840
messaging we'd love to hear about that
 

00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:50.360
messaging we'd love to hear about that
because i think at that point this could

00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:50.370
because i think at that point this could
 

00:24:50.370 --> 00:24:52.100
because i think at that point this could
be a nap would share we could talk about

00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:52.110
be a nap would share we could talk about
 

00:24:52.110 --> 00:24:54.380
be a nap would share we could talk about
featuring so yeah yeah nothing it's our

00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:54.390
featuring so yeah yeah nothing it's our
 

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:55.820

00:25:01.580 --> 00:25:01.590
Android that's true says he's looking
 

00:25:01.590 --> 00:25:03.830
Android that's true says he's looking
pretty pure Android but uh yeah so once

00:25:03.830 --> 00:25:03.840
pretty pure Android but uh yeah so once
 

00:25:03.840 --> 00:25:06.320
pretty pure Android but uh yeah so once
yeah I think a couple a couple of little

00:25:06.320 --> 00:25:06.330
yeah I think a couple a couple of little
 

00:25:06.330 --> 00:25:08.870
yeah I think a couple a couple of little
changes and getting rid of the refresh

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:08.880
changes and getting rid of the refresh
 

00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:10.640
changes and getting rid of the refresh
button and go into a different refresh

00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:10.650
button and go into a different refresh
 

00:25:10.650 --> 00:25:12.770
button and go into a different refresh
cycle that would be because we need to

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:12.780
cycle that would be because we need to
 

00:25:12.780 --> 00:25:14.360
cycle that would be because we need to
stock up and we totally need your stuck

00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:14.370
stock up and we totally need your stuck
 

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.980
stock up and we totally need your stuck
a pin this this is nice yeah definitely

00:25:15.980 --> 00:25:15.990
a pin this this is nice yeah definitely

it would be nice to make it more visible

00:33:02.910 --> 00:33:02.920
it would be nice to make it more visible
 

00:33:02.920 --> 00:33:04.900
it would be nice to make it more visible
you know same thing with the order

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:04.910
you know same thing with the order
 

00:33:04.910 --> 00:33:07.600
you know same thing with the order
ticket but I think that could be bigger

00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:07.610
ticket but I think that could be bigger
 

00:33:07.610 --> 00:33:09.160
ticket but I think that could be bigger
and a little further away from the

00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:09.170
and a little further away from the
 

00:33:09.170 --> 00:33:11.290
and a little further away from the
status bar I think that would make me a

00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:11.300
status bar I think that would make me a
 

00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:12.520
status bar I think that would make me a
little more comfortable and we might be

00:33:12.520 --> 00:33:12.530
little more comfortable and we might be
 

00:33:12.530 --> 00:33:14.380
little more comfortable and we might be
useful to emphasize the actions that you

00:33:14.380 --> 00:33:14.390
useful to emphasize the actions that you
 

00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:15.970
useful to emphasize the actions that you
want people to take or the information

00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:15.980
want people to take or the information
 

00:33:15.980 --> 00:33:17.110
want people to take or the information
that they may need and make that a

00:33:17.110 --> 00:33:17.120
that they may need and make that a
 

00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:19.600
that they may need and make that a
little more obvious you I nitpick if you

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:19.610
little more obvious you I nitpick if you
 

00:33:19.610 --> 00:33:21.310
little more obvious you I nitpick if you
have tabs you should be able to swipe

00:33:21.310 --> 00:33:21.320
have tabs you should be able to swipe
 

00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.380
have tabs you should be able to swipe
between them so you want to have that

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:23.390
between them so you want to have that
 

00:33:23.390 --> 00:33:25.060
between them so you want to have that
view pager implementation on the front

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:25.070
view pager implementation on the front
 

00:33:25.070 --> 00:33:26.620
view pager implementation on the front
page just swipe between tickets and

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:26.630
page just swipe between tickets and
 

00:33:26.630 --> 00:33:29.950
page just swipe between tickets and
statistics I don't know why we do tabs

00:33:29.950 --> 00:33:29.960
statistics I don't know why we do tabs
 

00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:31.900
statistics I don't know why we do tabs
without view a tourism yeah we should

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:31.910
without view a tourism yeah we should
 

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:34.420
without view a tourism yeah we should
just not allow it yeah so that's that's

00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:34.430
just not allow it yeah so that's that's
 

00:33:34.430 --> 00:33:36.490
just not allow it yeah so that's that's
the only other sort of nitpicky as well

00:33:36.490 --> 00:33:36.500
the only other sort of nitpicky as well
 

00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:38.110
the only other sort of nitpicky as well
when you've got the notification so

00:33:38.110 --> 00:33:38.120
when you've got the notification so
 

00:33:38.120 --> 00:33:40.330
when you've got the notification so
you've got when the ticket will expire

00:33:40.330 --> 00:33:40.340
you've got when the ticket will expire
 

00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:44.260
you've got when the ticket will expire
valid from code I'd almost want to

00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:44.270
valid from code I'd almost want to
 

00:33:44.270 --> 00:33:46.660
valid from code I'd almost want to
change it around a little bit so that

00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:46.670
change it around a little bit so that
 

00:33:46.670 --> 00:33:48.610
change it around a little bit so that
you had again made it a little bit more

00:33:48.610 --> 00:33:48.620
you had again made it a little bit more
 

00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:51.490
you had again made it a little bit more
obvious how long until it expires so

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:51.500
obvious how long until it expires so
 

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.140
obvious how long until it expires so
you've got that countdown is indicated

00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:53.150
you've got that countdown is indicated
 

00:33:53.150 --> 00:33:55.060
you've got that countdown is indicated
by red I just want to see like 10

00:33:55.060 --> 00:33:55.070
by red I just want to see like 10
 

00:33:55.070 --> 00:33:57.040
by red I just want to see like 10
minutes five o'clock you know whatever

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:57.050
minutes five o'clock you know whatever
 

00:33:57.050 --> 00:33:58.930
minutes five o'clock you know whatever
the those two numbers are should be kind

00:33:58.930 --> 00:33:58.940
the those two numbers are should be kind
 

00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:01.480
the those two numbers are should be kind
of the you know made Baldur made more

00:34:01.480 --> 00:34:01.490
of the you know made Baldur made more
 

00:34:01.490 --> 00:34:04.810
of the you know made Baldur made more
obvious yeah the orange stands for like

00:34:04.810 --> 00:34:04.820
obvious yeah the orange stands for like
 

00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.360
obvious yeah the orange stands for like
20 minutes then the red one stands for

00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:07.370
20 minutes then the red one stands for
 

00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:09.970
20 minutes then the red one stands for
term for the last 10 minutes and then it

00:34:09.970 --> 00:34:09.980
term for the last 10 minutes and then it
 

00:34:09.980 --> 00:34:13.150
term for the last 10 minutes and then it
goes great for expired ticket side nice

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:13.160
goes great for expired ticket side nice
 

00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:15.520
goes great for expired ticket side nice
and beautifully once once i'm done with

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:15.530
and beautifully once once i'm done with
 

00:34:15.530 --> 00:34:17.590
and beautifully once once i'm done with
my ticket i can i can swipe it away

00:34:17.590 --> 00:34:17.600
my ticket i can i can swipe it away
 

00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:19.330
my ticket i can i can swipe it away
probably after it's expired is that

00:34:19.330 --> 00:34:19.340
probably after it's expired is that
 

00:34:19.340 --> 00:34:21.880
probably after it's expired is that
right mmhmm yeah that is that explains

00:34:21.880 --> 00:34:21.890
right mmhmm yeah that is that explains
 

00:34:21.890 --> 00:34:23.980
right mmhmm yeah that is that explains
why i can't get rid of it so that's fine

00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:23.990
why i can't get rid of it so that's fine
 

00:34:23.990 --> 00:34:26.170
why i can't get rid of it so that's fine
and i'm guessing i haven't actually

00:34:26.170 --> 00:34:26.180
and i'm guessing i haven't actually
 

00:34:26.180 --> 00:34:28.170
and i'm guessing i haven't actually
tried adding multiple tickets yeah nice

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:28.180
tried adding multiple tickets yeah nice
 

00:34:28.180 --> 00:34:32.799
tried adding multiple tickets yeah nice
add lots of tickets

00:34:32.799 --> 00:34:32.809
 
 

00:34:32.809 --> 00:34:36.740
 
I'm testing you for that works that

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:36.750
I'm testing you for that works that
 

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:39.169
I'm testing you for that works that
works nicely now one thing that you may

00:34:39.169 --> 00:34:39.179
works nicely now one thing that you may
 

00:34:39.179 --> 00:34:41.299
works nicely now one thing that you may
want to consider though is that if I do

00:34:41.299 --> 00:34:41.309
want to consider though is that if I do
 

00:34:41.309 --> 00:34:43.039
want to consider though is that if I do
have a lot of tickets and that's in

00:34:43.039 --> 00:34:43.049
have a lot of tickets and that's in
 

00:34:43.049 --> 00:34:44.659
have a lot of tickets and that's in
fairness probably not a very common use

00:34:44.659 --> 00:34:44.669
fairness probably not a very common use
 

00:34:44.669 --> 00:34:47.780
fairness probably not a very common use
case I risk flooding my notification bar

00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:47.790
case I risk flooding my notification bar
 

00:34:47.790 --> 00:34:50.450
case I risk flooding my notification bar
so you may want to consider collapsing

00:34:50.450 --> 00:34:50.460
so you may want to consider collapsing
 

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:52.129
so you may want to consider collapsing
that in so that it's just got the latest

00:34:52.129 --> 00:34:52.139
that in so that it's just got the latest
 

00:34:52.139 --> 00:34:55.940
that in so that it's just got the latest
one and the total number of tickets you

00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:55.950
one and the total number of tickets you
 

00:34:55.950 --> 00:34:57.980
one and the total number of tickets you
know how would I one can say that if

00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:57.990
know how would I one can say that if
 

00:34:57.990 --> 00:34:59.329
know how would I one can say that if
you're traveling with your family for

00:34:59.329 --> 00:34:59.339
you're traveling with your family for
 

00:34:59.339 --> 00:35:01.280
you're traveling with your family for
instance you know you might buy four

00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:01.290
instance you know you might buy four
 

00:35:01.290 --> 00:35:03.589
instance you know you might buy four
tickets to the same place yeah but we

00:35:03.589 --> 00:35:03.599
tickets to the same place yeah but we
 

00:35:03.599 --> 00:35:05.660
tickets to the same place yeah but we
still can group them yeah exactly you

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:05.670
still can group them yeah exactly you
 

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.370
still can group them yeah exactly you
don't them by expiration time something

00:35:07.370 --> 00:35:07.380
don't them by expiration time something
 

00:35:07.380 --> 00:35:08.420
don't them by expiration time something
like that I think that was really oh

00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:08.430
like that I think that was really oh
 

00:35:08.430 --> 00:35:10.579
like that I think that was really oh
that yeah that would be great see and

00:35:10.579 --> 00:35:10.589
that yeah that would be great see and
 

00:35:10.589 --> 00:35:13.130
that yeah that would be great see and
they do dismiss yeah perfect so yeah

00:35:13.130 --> 00:35:13.140
they do dismiss yeah perfect so yeah
 

00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.870
they do dismiss yeah perfect so yeah
nicely done no check to see if I have

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:14.880
nicely done no check to see if I have
 

00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:17.329
nicely done no check to see if I have
any additional notes not really i think

00:35:17.329 --> 00:35:17.339
any additional notes not really i think
 

00:35:17.339 --> 00:35:19.880
any additional notes not really i think
the only real issue we had was was the

00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:19.890
the only real issue we had was was the
 

00:35:19.890 --> 00:35:22.000
the only real issue we had was was the
swiping between tabs everything else is

00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:22.010
swiping between tabs everything else is
 

00:35:22.010 --> 00:35:24.620
swiping between tabs everything else is
nitpicky hopefully you'll find some of

00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:24.630
nitpicky hopefully you'll find some of
 

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.839
nitpicky hopefully you'll find some of
that useful you know but totally your

00:35:26.839 --> 00:35:26.849
that useful you know but totally your
 

00:35:26.849 --> 00:35:29.510
that useful you know but totally your
call yeah of course I mean what one

00:35:29.510 --> 00:35:29.520
call yeah of course I mean what one
 

00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:30.829
call yeah of course I mean what one
argument for not swiping between the

00:35:30.829 --> 00:35:30.839
argument for not swiping between the
 

00:35:30.839 --> 00:35:34.039
argument for not swiping between the
tabs is that if if you can dismiss these

00:35:34.039 --> 00:35:34.049
tabs is that if if you can dismiss these
 

00:35:34.049 --> 00:35:37.190
tabs is that if if you can dismiss these
tickets by swiping them away it might be

00:35:37.190 --> 00:35:37.200
tickets by swiping them away it might be
 

00:35:37.200 --> 00:35:39.440
tickets by swiping them away it might be
hard to distinguish between a swipe on

00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:39.450
hard to distinguish between a swipe on
 

00:35:39.450 --> 00:35:41.750
hard to distinguish between a swipe on
the ticket I'm swipe between tabs but I

00:35:41.750 --> 00:35:41.760
the ticket I'm swipe between tabs but I
 

00:35:41.760 --> 00:35:43.240
the ticket I'm swipe between tabs but I
think what we're what we're really

00:35:43.240 --> 00:35:43.250
think what we're what we're really
 

00:35:43.250 --> 00:35:47.059
think what we're what we're really
asking people do now is an edge swiat so

00:35:47.059 --> 00:35:47.069
asking people do now is an edge swiat so
 

00:35:47.069 --> 00:35:49.970
asking people do now is an edge swiat so
if you've got something where the you

00:35:49.970 --> 00:35:49.980
if you've got something where the you
 

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:52.819
if you've got something where the you
know you're swiping internally then it's

00:35:52.819 --> 00:35:52.829
know you're swiping internally then it's
 

00:35:52.829 --> 00:35:54.319
know you're swiping internally then it's
understandable that that gesture

00:35:54.319 --> 00:35:54.329
understandable that that gesture
 

00:35:54.329 --> 00:35:56.000
understandable that that gesture
wouldn't switch between tabs but an edge

00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:56.010
wouldn't switch between tabs but an edge
 

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:58.849
wouldn't switch between tabs but an edge
swipe always should yeah the stock trak

00:35:58.849 --> 00:35:58.859
swipe always should yeah the stock trak
 

00:35:58.859 --> 00:36:00.230
swipe always should yeah the stock trak
iraq but we just looked at actually does

00:36:00.230 --> 00:36:00.240
iraq but we just looked at actually does
 

00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:01.970
iraq but we just looked at actually does
this really well for bringing out the

00:36:01.970 --> 00:36:01.980
this really well for bringing out the
 

00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:05.089
this really well for bringing out the
action the draw at the side it does sort

00:36:05.089 --> 00:36:05.099
action the draw at the side it does sort
 

00:36:05.099 --> 00:36:06.500
action the draw at the side it does sort
of an edge swipe for that which works

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:06.510
of an edge swipe for that which works
 

00:36:06.510 --> 00:36:11.180
of an edge swipe for that which works
really really well perfect alright so we

00:36:11.180 --> 00:36:11.190
really really well perfect alright so we
 

00:36:11.190 --> 00:36:12.440
really really well perfect alright so we
shouldn't spend too much more time on

00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:12.450
shouldn't spend too much more time on
 

00:36:12.450 --> 00:36:14.180
shouldn't spend too much more time on

to navigate through the app so you want
 

00:41:30.710 --> 00:41:33.609
to navigate through the app so you want

right and then the action bar I think

00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:56.750
right and then the action bar I think
 

00:41:56.750 --> 00:41:59.140
right and then the action bar I think
yeah so it's an interesting choice i'm

00:41:59.140 --> 00:41:59.150
yeah so it's an interesting choice i'm
 

00:41:59.150 --> 00:42:01.109
yeah so it's an interesting choice i'm
guessing this is a split action bar

00:42:01.109 --> 00:42:01.119
guessing this is a split action bar
 

00:42:01.119 --> 00:42:03.250

that makes sense so you are using a

that's going to be refreshing data so

that's going to be refreshing data so
rapidly that a user is going to want to

of it makes sense an instant messaging

00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:55.490

you may even want to include the

that's good advice right so then what
you may want to do is consider adding

00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:17.570
you may want to do is consider adding
 

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.960
you may want to do is consider adding
one of those actions to this main screen

00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:19.970

you may only want to add that button for
 

00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:38.140
you may only want to add that button for

example of why leave why you may make

00:47:01.150 --> 00:47:01.160
example of why leave why you may make

sense to have that sort of at the top

00:47:02.710 --> 00:47:02.720
sense to have that sort of at the top
 

00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:04.120
sense to have that sort of at the top
because when most people are opening the

app they're expecting the main actions
 

00:47:05.630 --> 00:47:08.050
app they're expecting the main actions
to be up here and so by not having it

to be up here and so by not having it
 

00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:09.310
to be up here and so by not having it
there it makes it a little bit less

00:47:09.310 --> 00:47:09.320
there it makes it a little bit less
 

00:47:09.320 --> 00:47:10.890
there it makes it a little bit less
likely that they hit that plus button

00:47:10.890 --> 00:47:10.900
likely that they hit that plus button
 

00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:13.120
likely that they hit that plus button
you may even want to go a step further

way about filters to I think it's a

00:52:57.510 --> 00:52:57.520
way about filters to I think it's a
 

00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.250
way about filters to I think it's a
little harder to do but especially when

00:52:59.250 --> 00:52:59.260
little harder to do but especially when
 

00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:01.319

your filter is just a list of checkboxes
 

00:53:01.329 --> 00:53:04.710
your filter is just a list of checkboxes
if you can pop it over you know like

00:53:04.710 --> 00:53:04.720
if you can pop it over you know like
 

00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:07.020
if you can pop it over you know like
drop it down from the top or put it in

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:07.030
drop it down from the top or put it in
 

00:53:07.030 --> 00:53:09.180
drop it down from the top or put it in
the bottom so that you can see the the

the bottom so that you can see the the
 

00:53:09.190 --> 00:53:11.130
the bottom so that you can see the the
results absolutely one thing that you

00:53:11.130 --> 00:53:11.140
results absolutely one thing that you
 

00:53:11.140 --> 00:53:13.349
results absolutely one thing that you

would be given that we don't have so

00:53:17.160 --> 00:53:17.170

much local information but it might be

00:53:18.630 --> 00:53:18.640
much local information but it might be
 

00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.339
much local information but it might be
interesting to apply filters by

00:53:20.339 --> 00:53:20.349
interesting to apply filters by
 

00:53:20.349 --> 00:53:22.230
interesting to apply filters by
basically pivoting on what the

00:53:22.230 --> 00:53:22.240
basically pivoting on what the
 

00:53:22.240 --> 00:53:23.910
basically pivoting on what the
information that you have and so if i

00:53:23.910 --> 00:53:23.920
information that you have and so if i
 

00:53:23.920 --> 00:53:26.130
information that you have and so if i
click on the seashell icon you know i

00:53:26.130 --> 00:53:26.140
click on the seashell icon you know i
 

00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:28.319
click on the seashell icon you know i
hit the icon specifically maybe that

00:53:28.319 --> 00:53:28.329
hit the icon specifically maybe that
 

00:53:28.329 --> 00:53:30.930
hit the icon specifically maybe that
just shows me all of the seas so it does

00:53:30.930 --> 00:53:30.940
just shows me all of the seas so it does
 

00:53:30.940 --> 00:53:33.359
just shows me all of the seas so it does
apply that filter that way rather than

00:53:33.359 --> 00:53:33.369
apply that filter that way rather than
 

00:53:33.369 --> 00:53:35.000
apply that filter that way rather than
having to go through the second screen

00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:35.010
having to go through the second screen
 

00:53:35.010 --> 00:53:36.720
having to go through the second screen
again i think that's something you

00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:36.730
again i think that's something you
 

00:53:36.730 --> 00:53:38.130
again i think that's something you
probably want to be the test with people

00:53:38.130 --> 00:53:38.140
probably want to be the test with people
 

00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.480
probably want to be the test with people
to see if they if that means that they

00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:39.490
to see if they if that means that they
 

00:53:39.490 --> 00:53:40.799
to see if they if that means that they
get lost and they don't know how to go

00:53:40.799 --> 00:53:40.809
get lost and they don't know how to go
 

00:53:40.809 --> 00:53:43.079
get lost and they don't know how to go
back but something like that as a way of

00:53:43.079 --> 00:53:43.089
back but something like that as a way of
 

00:53:43.089 --> 00:53:45.120
back but something like that as a way of
being able to click here i get a list of

00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:45.130
being able to click here i get a list of
 

00:53:45.130 --> 00:53:46.530
being able to click here i get a list of
all of the lakes and if i hit back it

00:53:46.530 --> 00:53:46.540
all of the lakes and if i hit back it
 

00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.940
all of the lakes and if i hit back it
takes me back to the main screen it's

00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:47.950
takes me back to the main screen it's
 

00:53:47.950 --> 00:53:49.620
takes me back to the main screen it's
unfiltered i think that will be really

00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:49.630
unfiltered i think that will be really
 

00:53:49.630 --> 00:53:51.510
unfiltered i think that will be really
interesting i would get lost on the list

00:53:51.510 --> 00:53:51.520
interesting i would get lost on the list
 

00:53:51.520 --> 00:53:53.099
interesting i would get lost on the list
it might be okay with that on though on

00:53:53.099 --> 00:53:53.109
it might be okay with that on though on
 

00:53:53.109 --> 00:53:55.559
it might be okay with that on though on
the second screen seconds yeah yeah it

00:53:55.559 --> 00:53:55.569
