Welcome back.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.300
In the last lesson you deployed
a small Hadoop cluster.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:09.014
I'm sure you can imagine that setting up
a larger cluster the same way would be

00:00:09.014 --> 00:00:09.710
too tedious.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:12.000
Just ten more, just ten more,
just ten more.

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.840
Luckily for all of us, there is
software that automates deployment.

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:21.290
Apache Ambari makes it much
easier to provision, monitor, and

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:23.460
maintain Hadoop clusters.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
They'll also install common applications
built on HDFS, such as Hive and Spark.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.840
We'll use it to create a larger cluster,

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.692
like the one you'd
have at a real company.

00:00:32.692 --> 00:00:36.302
[BLANK_AUDIO]

00:00:36.302 --> 00:00:40.477
Again, the cluster will be deployed on
Amazon EC2 instances since you don't

00:00:40.477 --> 00:00:42.000
have server racks.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.440
However, Ambari can also be
used with common hardware.

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:47.700
The process is pretty straightforward,
I'll lead you through it.
