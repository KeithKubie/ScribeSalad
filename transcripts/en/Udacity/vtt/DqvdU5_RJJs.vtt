Learning by correcting mistakes is a fundamental process of human learning.

00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:06.750
In fact, it may closely resemble the way you and

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.440
I learn and practice. In our lives, we rarely are passive learners.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:16.120
Most of the time we're active participants in the learning process. Even in

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:19.680
a difficult setting like this, you're not just listening to what I'm saying.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:23.190
Instead, you're using your knowledge and reasoning, to make sense of what I'm

00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:28.390
saying. You generate expectations. Sometimes those expectations may be violated.

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:30.860
When they're violated, we generate explanations for

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:35.740
them. We try to figure out, what was in error, in your knowledge and reasoning.

00:00:35.740 --> 00:00:40.770
This, is learning by correcting mistakes. Notice, that you think about your own

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:44.490
thinking, a step towards meta-reasoning, which is our next lesson.
