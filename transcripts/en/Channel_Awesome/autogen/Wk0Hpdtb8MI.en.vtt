00:11:52.310 --> 00:11:52.320
movie that a lot of our effects I've
 

00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.690
movie that a lot of our effects I've
seen and it builds up to this climax

00:11:56.690 --> 00:11:56.700
seen and it builds up to this climax
 

00:11:56.700 --> 00:12:03.830
seen and it builds up to this climax
that I I can't go that much into I guess

00:12:03.830 --> 00:12:03.840
that I I can't go that much into I guess
 

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:05.780
that I I can't go that much into I guess
I'll say this a lot of people not

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:05.790
I'll say this a lot of people not
 

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:06.740
I'll say this a lot of people not
knowing the books

00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:06.750
knowing the books
 

00:12:06.750 --> 00:12:08.330
knowing the books
I'm guessing they did this in the books

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:08.340
I'm guessing they did this in the books
 

00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.450
I'm guessing they did this in the books
but not knowing the books might be

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:11.460
but not knowing the books might be
 

00:12:11.460 --> 00:12:14.050
but not knowing the books might be
disappointed in the climax it's both

00:12:14.050 --> 00:12:14.060
disappointed in the climax it's both
 

00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:16.550
disappointed in the climax it's both
it's both giving you exactly what you

00:12:16.550 --> 00:12:16.560
it's both giving you exactly what you
 

00:12:16.560 --> 00:12:18.890
it's both giving you exactly what you
expect and what you don't expect at the

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:18.900
expect and what you don't expect at the
 

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:20.570
expect and what you don't expect at the
same time and I think they might throw

00:12:20.570 --> 00:12:20.580
same time and I think they might throw
 

00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:22.910
same time and I think they might throw
people off but they put this way there's

00:12:22.910 --> 00:12:22.920
people off but they put this way there's
 

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:25.070
people off but they put this way there's
a lot of movies where it's like whatever

00:12:25.070 --> 00:12:25.080
a lot of movies where it's like whatever
 

00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:27.470
a lot of movies where it's like whatever

00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:44.420
different so I I admire it for what for
what it does the climax but I think a

00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:44.430
what it does the climax but I think a
 

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.070
what it does the climax but I think a
lot of people might look at that like

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.080
lot of people might look at that like
 

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.880
lot of people might look at that like

the choices he makes going into this
versus if he knew something else going

00:13:26.800 --> 00:13:26.810

00:13:26.810 --> 00:13:30.490
versus if he knew something else going
into it and the fact that those choices

00:13:30.490 --> 00:13:30.500
into it and the fact that those choices
 

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:32.500
