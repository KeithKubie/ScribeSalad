[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:11.140
SPEAKER: So our guests today
are Neal Stephenson and Nicole

00:00:11.140 --> 00:00:14.460
Galland, and they've
written a book called

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.950
"The Rise and Fall of D.O.D.O."

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.490
You may know them from their
other books, which I will not

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.240
attempt to list from memory,
but you can look those up.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:26.040
So Neal and Nicole,
take it away.

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.378
NEAL STEPHENSON: [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:27.378 --> 00:00:28.450
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:28.950
Thanks.

00:00:31.431 --> 00:00:31.930
Thanks.

00:00:31.930 --> 00:00:35.360
So we have a little program that
goes for 20, 25 minutes, where

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:38.730
we're basically just reading
some segments from the book,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.750
from the early part of the
book, that kind of set up

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.410
the storyline a little bit
without being too spoilery.

00:00:46.410 --> 00:00:50.370
And so Nikki is going to begin
by reading just the opening

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:53.400
few pages, and then
I'll do a little bridge,

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:55.826
and we'll jump ahead
about 30 pages.

00:00:55.826 --> 00:00:56.700
NICOLE GALLAND: Cool.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.945
All right.

00:00:57.945 --> 00:01:02.700
"Diachronial--
preamble, July, 1851.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:06.370
My name is Melisande Stokes,
and this is my story.

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:10.080
I am writing in July,
1851, common era or--

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.110
let's face it-- anno
domini in the guest chamber

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:16.740
of a middle class home in
Kensington London, England.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.500
But I am not a native
of this place or time.

00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.580
In fact, I am quite
desperate to get out of here.

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.650
But you already knew
that, because when

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:27.540
I'm done writing
this thing, which

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:29.340
for reasons that will
soon become clear

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:31.680
I'm calling
diachronical, I'm going

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.800
to take it to the very discreet
private offices of the Fugger

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:38.840
Bank, Threadneedle Street, lock
it up in a safe deposit box,

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:42.030
and hand it over to the most
powerful banker in London, who

00:01:42.030 --> 00:01:45.300
is going to seal it
in a vault, not to be

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.150
opened for more than 160 years.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:50.820
The Fuggers, above all
people in this world,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:53.550
understand the dangers
of diachronic shear.

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.520
They know that to open the box
and read the documents sooner

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:58.620
would be to trigger
a catastrophe that

00:01:58.620 --> 00:02:01.620
would wipe London's financial
district off the map

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:04.500
and leave a smoking
crater in its place.

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:07.080
Actually, it would be much
worse than a smoking crater,

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:09.750
but a smoking crater is how
history would describe it

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:13.610
once the surviving witnesses had
been sent off to the madhouse.

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.360
I'm writing with a steel-nibbed
dip pen, model number 137B,

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.760
from Hughes and Son,
Ltd. of Birmingham.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:24.540
I requested the extra fine tip,
partly to save money on paper,

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.670
and partly so that I
could jab my thumb with it

00:02:26.670 --> 00:02:28.080
and draw blood.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.660
The brown smear across
the top of this page

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.290
can be tested in any
21st century DNA lab.

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.950
Compare the results to what is
on file in my personnel record

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:39.360
at D.O.D.O.
headquarters, and you

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:42.300
will know that I am a
woman of your era writing

00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:44.970
in the middle of
the 19th century.

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:46.410
I intend to write
everything that

00:02:46.410 --> 00:02:48.750
explains how I came
to be here, no matter

00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.810
how far-fetched or
hallucinatory it may sound.

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.750
To quote Peter Gabriel,
a singer-songwriter who

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:59.790
will be born 99 years from
now, this will be my testimony.

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:01.980
I do attest that I am
here against my will,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:05.580
having been sent here
from September 8th, 1850,

00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:08.640
and from the city of San
Francisco, California the day

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.040
before California was
granted statehood.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:14.580
I do attest that I belong
in Boston, Massachusetts

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:17.400
in the first quarter
of the 21st century.

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.950
There and then, I am
part of the Department

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:23.700
of Diachronic Operations, a
black budget arm of the United

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.670
States government that has
gone rather badly off the rails

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:28.860
due to internal treachery.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.390
In the time in which I write
this, 1851, magic is waning.

00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.700
The research that D.O.D.O.
Paid me to perform

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.890
indicates that magic
will cease to exist

00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:41.040
at the end of this
month, July 28th.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.750
When that happens, I
will be trapped here

00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.660
in a post-magic world
for the rest of my days.

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.310
The only way anyone
will ever know

00:03:47.310 --> 00:03:50.340
what became of me is
through this deposition.

00:03:50.340 --> 00:03:52.380
While I have managed
to land myself

00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:56.310
in comfortable, by 1851
standards, quarters with access

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:59.610
to pen, ink, leisure
time, and privacy,

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:02.370
it has been at the
expense of freedom.

00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:04.710
My hosts would not
consider allowing me out

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.800
of the house alone for an
evening constitutional,

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.860
let alone to seek out
witches who might help me.

00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:13.740
One comment before I begin--

00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.570
if anyone from
D.O.D.O. Ever reads

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:18.300
this, for the love of God,
please add corset makers

00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.670
to the list of abetters
we need to recruit

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:22.870
in any Victorian DTAPS.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:24.990
Corsets are intended
to be custom

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.310
made to conform to the actual
shape of a lady's body,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:30.750
and it's uncomfortable to
have to borrow one or buy one

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.110
off the rack, although servants
and poorer women generally do

00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:36.000
that, but do not
lace them tightly,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.400
as they must engage
in manual labor.

00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:40.590
Being here entirely
on charity, I

00:04:40.590 --> 00:04:44.250
prefer not to ask my hosts to
extend credit for a custom fit

00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:46.890
one, but wearing this one
borrowed from my hostess

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:48.160
is just awful.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:50.580
It makes a Renaissance
bodice feel like a bikini.

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.835
I'm not even kidding."

00:04:52.835 --> 00:04:54.210
NEAL STEPHENSON:
So she goes on--

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.150
Mel, Melisande--
goes on to explain

00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:01.740
how she was working at Harvard
University in the Department

00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:06.160
of Ancient Classical Languages
as a downtrodden and exploited

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:11.740
adjunct faculty member when she
met a young man named Tristan,

00:05:11.740 --> 00:05:14.140
who was clearly not from
around there in the sense

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:18.580
that he was a kind of
military ROTC-ish kind of guy.

00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:23.320
And Tristan recruited her for
a top secret government job

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.520
with an entity known as
D.O.D.O., which he would not--

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.730
he doesn't explain what the
initials stand for at first,

00:05:30.730 --> 00:05:35.020
so she has to keep guessing
what it might mean.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.510
And the job has to
do with translating

00:05:37.510 --> 00:05:40.720
a trove of miscellaneous
ancient documents

00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:44.560
that D.O.D.O. has come
into the possession of,

00:05:44.560 --> 00:05:46.300
and it all has to
be done secretly.

00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:50.290
So they get a space in a
building between Harvard

00:05:50.290 --> 00:05:53.740
and MIT that's kind of
a classic start-up den,

00:05:53.740 --> 00:05:56.500
just a crappy old
building, where

00:05:56.500 --> 00:05:59.920
little companies go in and
out of existence all the time.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:01.960
And they have a
space there, and they

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:04.510
fill it up with these documents
and start working on them.

00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:09.220
And it becomes clear that every
single one of these documents

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:14.020
has something or other to do
with magic as a real thing that

00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:17.150
once existed but exists no more.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:21.580
So we're going to pick up
the action on about page 30,

00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:26.320
after this process has been
going on for a few months,

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.360
and they've translated
a lot of documents,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.730
and they have a
database built up.

00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:33.670
But they don't yet
fully understand

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:36.004
why magic disappeared.

00:06:36.004 --> 00:06:37.670
NICOLE GALLAND: And
we're going to do it

00:06:37.670 --> 00:06:40.520
as a dramatic rendition,
because so much of it

00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:44.000
is just a conversation
between the two of them.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:46.040
Normally, we have scripts
like Neal has there,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:47.990
but I left mine
in the hotel room,

00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:50.209
so I'm going to improvise
trying to remember

00:06:50.209 --> 00:06:51.500
what I'm supposed to say where.

00:06:51.500 --> 00:06:53.970
I think it'll be fine.

00:06:53.970 --> 00:06:55.550
So it starts with Mel.

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:57.710
"There was never any
doubt as to the gist.

00:06:57.710 --> 00:06:59.960
Some manner of cause
and effect relationship

00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:02.510
existed between the rise
of scientific knowledge

00:07:02.510 --> 00:07:04.250
and the decline of magic.

00:07:04.250 --> 00:07:07.070
The two could not
comfortably co-exist.

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:10.460
To the extent that the database
could be cajoled into spitting

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.160
out actual numbers, it
was clear that magic

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:15.560
had declined gradually
but steadily starting

00:07:15.560 --> 00:07:17.729
in the middle of the 1600s.

00:07:17.729 --> 00:07:19.520
It was still holding
its own in the opening

00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.180
decades of the 1800s but
plunged into a nosedive

00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:24.980
during the 1830s.

00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:29.150
From then through the 1840s,
magic declined precipitously.

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:32.870
As our store of documents, many
written by witches themselves,

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.680
grew to fill a phalanx of used
filing cabinets and gun safes

00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:38.630
that Tristan scored
on Craigslist,

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.310
we were able to
track the decline

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.070
from year to year and
then from month to month.

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:45.530
These poor women expressed
shock at the dwindling

00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:49.340
of their powers, in some cases,
mentioning specific spells

00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:53.390
that had worked a few weeks
ago but no longer had effect.

00:07:53.390 --> 00:07:56.960
As it turns out, in 1851, the
year in which I find myself

00:07:56.960 --> 00:08:00.020
as I scribble these words, all
of the world's technologies

00:08:00.020 --> 00:08:02.330
were brought together
for the Great Exhibition

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:04.580
at the newly constructed
magnificent Crystal

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.640
Palace in Hyde Park, London.

00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:09.920
Tristan's hypothesis,
therefore, held

00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.740
that this coming together,
this conscious concentration

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.820
of technological advancement
all in one point of spacetime

00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:20.540
had dampened magic to the point,
where it fizzled out for good.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:22.490
Like a doused fire,
it had no power

00:08:22.490 --> 00:08:25.190
to rekindle itself
once extinguished.

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:28.850
The causal relationship between
the two eluded us for a time.

00:08:28.850 --> 00:08:31.430
I suggested that magic's
flourishing required people

00:08:31.430 --> 00:08:34.340
to believe in it, but Tristan
dismissed this mentality

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:37.520
as belonging more to children's
literature than to reality.

00:08:37.520 --> 00:08:40.010
He was certain there was
a mechanical or physical

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:42.080
causality, that
there was something

00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:45.620
about the technological world
view or technology itself

00:08:45.620 --> 00:08:48.740
that somehow jammed the
frequencies magic used.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:51.260
We both began to read whatever
we could about the Great

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.980
Exhibition in the hopes that
it might illuminate something.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:56.480
You may notice that
I was exceeding

00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:59.240
by far my responsibilities
as a translator.

00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:01.610
Translating especially
of obscure texts

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:04.340
written in extinct
tongues often resembles

00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:05.870
the solving of a riddle.

00:09:05.870 --> 00:09:08.810
Here was a riddle to
put all others to shame.

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.700
Tristan's enthusiasm
was infectious,

00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:12.680
and I could not
divest myself from it.

00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:14.390
Having no other
responsibilities,

00:09:14.390 --> 00:09:17.896
I became as preoccupied with
his project as he was himself.

00:09:17.896 --> 00:09:21.080
Per Tristan's suggestion,
I took out stacks of books

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:22.430
from Widener Library.

00:09:22.430 --> 00:09:25.190
Harvard had not figured
out yet that I'd quit.

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:27.980
These included tomes on
everything from heliography

00:09:27.980 --> 00:09:30.980
to Queen Victoria's private
life to Baruch Spinoza's

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:33.380
sexual proclivities
to Frederick Bakewell

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:36.470
to the tempest prognosticator
to Strewhall numbers.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:38.060
I would bring these
to Tristan, and we

00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.190
would divide our time
between perusing them

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:41.750
and internet searches.

00:09:41.750 --> 00:09:46.040
We soon knew more about the
Great Exhibition and its 13,000

00:09:46.040 --> 00:09:48.680
odd exhibits than
Prince Albert ever did.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:51.560
We knew more about its
showcase, the Crystal Palace,

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:53.540
than even Joseph
Paxton, the gardener

00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:55.790
who designed the blessed thing.

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:57.840
We learned little
that was helpful.

00:09:57.840 --> 00:09:59.720
However, one evening
in March, as I

00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:01.550
sat on the consignment
store couch

00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.190
I'd insisted on bringing
into spruce up the place,

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:07.910
and Tristan lolled on the rug
beside a low table with a beer,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.980
each of us bleary-eyed
from reading,

00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:13.250
I encountered a passage in
an obscure booklet entitled,

00:10:13.250 --> 00:10:16.250
"Arresting and Alluring
Astronomical Anecdotes,"

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.500
published in 1897.

00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:21.200
Here, I learned that while
the Great Exhibition of 1851

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.460
was in process--

00:10:22.460 --> 00:10:24.140
it lasted for several months--

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:27.500
an event of relative interest
occurred elsewhere in Europe,

00:10:27.500 --> 00:10:30.380
to be precise, in
Koenigsberg, Prussia.

00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:33.020
For the first time in
history, a solar eclipse

00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:35.480
was successfully photographed.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:37.220
I read this statement aloud.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:39.650
It set Tristan on
fire with excitement.

00:10:39.650 --> 00:10:42.230
He had already suspected that
photography in particular

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:43.730
of all technological
developments

00:10:43.730 --> 00:10:46.820
was the likeliest to have
somehow impeded magic.

00:10:46.820 --> 00:10:48.921
Now somehow he was certain.

00:10:48.921 --> 00:10:51.170
It took me a while to calm
him down to the point where

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:52.931
he could explain himself."

00:10:52.931 --> 00:10:54.680
NEAL STEPHENSON: "I'll
be honest with you.

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:57.170
As a physicist, I'm a hack.

00:10:57.170 --> 00:10:59.030
I majored in it,
yes, but I was never

00:10:59.030 --> 00:11:01.070
employed in that capacity.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.610
But if you cut me, I still
bleed physicist blood.

00:11:04.610 --> 00:11:07.810
I'll go to my grave believing
that if magic existed,

00:11:07.810 --> 00:11:10.070
there was a scientific
explanation for it."

00:11:10.070 --> 00:11:12.403
NICOLE GALLAND: "That sounds
like a contradiction to me,

00:11:12.403 --> 00:11:14.090
since our whole
working hypothesis is

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:15.860
that science broke it somehow."

00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:17.360
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Work with me here.

00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.700
Have you ever heard of the
many worlds interpretation

00:11:19.700 --> 00:11:20.959
of quantum mechanics?"

00:11:20.959 --> 00:11:23.000
NICOLE GALLAND: "Only in
cocktail party discourse

00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.375
that would make you roll your
eyes and heave deep sighs."

00:11:25.375 --> 00:11:27.833
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Well, there
are certain experiments where

00:11:27.833 --> 00:11:30.260
the results only make
sense if the system that's

00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:34.550
being observed actually
exists in more than one state

00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:36.810
until the moment when
the scientist makes

00:11:36.810 --> 00:11:37.647
the observation."

00:11:37.647 --> 00:11:39.480
NICOLE GALLAND: "Is
this Schroedinger's cat,

00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.375
because even I have
heard of that?"

00:11:41.375 --> 00:11:43.500
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Well,
that's the classic example.

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.610
It's just a thought
experiment, by the way.

00:11:45.610 --> 00:11:47.010
No one ever actually did it."

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:48.218
NICOLE GALLAND: "That's good.

00:11:48.218 --> 00:11:49.640
Peter would be all over them."

00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.348
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Do
you know what it is?

00:11:51.348 --> 00:11:53.170
You put a cat in a sealed box.

00:11:53.170 --> 00:11:55.050
There's a device inside
of the box that's

00:11:55.050 --> 00:11:58.680
capable of killing the cat by
breaking open a vial of poison

00:11:58.680 --> 00:12:00.060
gas or something.

00:12:00.060 --> 00:12:03.510
That device is triggered by
some random event generator like

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.830
a sample of some radioactive
material that either decays,

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:10.590
producing a bit of
radiation, or doesn't.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.950
You close the lid.

00:12:11.950 --> 00:12:15.050
The cat and the poison gas
and the radioactive sample

00:12:15.050 --> 00:12:16.950
become a sealed system.

00:12:16.950 --> 00:12:19.710
You cannot predict or
know what has happened."

00:12:19.710 --> 00:12:22.260
NICOLE GALLAND: "You don't know
if the cat is alive or dead?"

00:12:22.260 --> 00:12:23.850
NEAL STEPHENSON: "It's
not just that you don't.

00:12:23.850 --> 00:12:24.630
You can't.

00:12:24.630 --> 00:12:26.790
There's literally
no way of knowing.

00:12:26.790 --> 00:12:29.130
Now in a classical
physics way of thinking,

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:30.840
it's either one or the other.

00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:34.230
The cat is either
alive or dead for real.

00:12:34.230 --> 00:12:36.030
You just don't
happen to know which.

00:12:36.030 --> 00:12:37.980
But in a quantum
physics way of thinking,

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.770
the cat really is
both alive and dead.

00:12:40.770 --> 00:12:43.980
It exists in two mutually
incompatible states

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:45.450
at the same time.

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.460
Not until you open the
lid and look inside

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:48.836
does the wave
function collapse."

00:12:48.836 --> 00:12:50.001
NICOLE GALLAND: "Whoa, whoa.

00:12:50.001 --> 00:12:51.300
You had me until the very end.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:53.137
When did we start
talking about--

00:12:53.137 --> 00:12:53.970
why did you call it?

00:12:53.970 --> 00:12:55.200
A wave function?

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.629
And how does that
whatever it is collapse?"

00:12:57.629 --> 00:12:58.670
NEAL STEPHENSON: "My bad.

00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:01.810
It's just physicist lingo
for what I was saying.

00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:04.800
If you were to express the
Schrodinger's cat experiment

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:07.330
mathematically, you'd
write down an equation

00:13:07.330 --> 00:13:08.580
that's called a wave function.

00:13:08.580 --> 00:13:12.290
That function has multiple
terms that are superimposed.

00:13:12.290 --> 00:13:14.010
It's not just one thing."

00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:15.639
NICOLE GALLAND:
"Multiple terms?"

00:13:15.639 --> 00:13:18.180
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Yeah, a term
here means a fragment of math.

00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.465
It is to an equation what
a phrase is to a sentence."

00:13:20.465 --> 00:13:21.840
NICOLE GALLAND:
"So you're saying

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.341
there's one term for cat is
alive and another for cat

00:13:24.341 --> 00:13:24.840
is dead.

00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.850
Is that what you
mean in this usage?"

00:13:26.850 --> 00:13:28.387
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Yes, o linguist."

00:13:28.387 --> 00:13:30.720
NICOLE GALLAND: "And when you
say they're superimposed?"

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:31.680
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Mathematically, it just

00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:33.810
means that they're sort
of added to each other

00:13:33.810 --> 00:13:35.850
to make a combined
picture of the system."

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:37.980
NICOLE GALLAND: "Until it
collapses or whatever."

00:13:37.980 --> 00:13:39.855
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Multiple
terms superimposed

00:13:39.855 --> 00:13:40.770
is a quantum thing.

00:13:40.770 --> 00:13:42.860
It's the essence of
quantum mechanics,

00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.640
but there is this
interesting fact, which

00:13:44.640 --> 00:13:47.030
is that that kind
of math only works,

00:13:47.030 --> 00:13:49.950
it only provides an accurate
description of the system

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:52.260
until you open the
lid and look inside.

00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:55.320
At that point, you see a live
cat or a dead cat, period.

00:13:55.320 --> 00:13:57.690
It has become a
classical system"

00:13:57.690 --> 00:14:01.050
NICOLE GALLAND: "Department
of deadly observations?

00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:02.137
He rolled his eyes.

00:14:02.137 --> 00:14:04.470
Anyway, that's what you mean
by the collapse of the wave

00:14:04.470 --> 00:14:05.160
function."

00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:06.290
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Yeah
it's just physicist

00:14:06.290 --> 00:14:07.860
speak for the thing
that happens when

00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:10.740
all of the superimposed
terms, the descriptions

00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:13.380
of different possible
realities, resolve

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:15.750
into a single classical
outcome that our brains can

00:14:15.750 --> 00:14:16.500
understand."

00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.770
NICOLE GALLAND: "Our scientific
rational brains, you mean.

00:14:19.770 --> 00:14:22.110
A look of mild satisfaction
came onto his face."

00:14:22.110 --> 00:14:22.830
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Exactly."

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:24.940
NICOLE GALLAND: "But now we've
circled back to my theory."

00:14:24.940 --> 00:14:26.070
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Which theory is that?"

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:26.880
NICOLE GALLAND: "The
one that belongs

00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:28.860
more to children's
literature than to reality.

00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:29.910
Remember?"

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:30.400
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Oh, yeah.

00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.860
People have to
believe in magic."

00:14:31.860 --> 00:14:32.800
NICOLE GALLAND: "Yes."

00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.008
NEAL STEPHENSON: "That's
not exactly what I'm saying.

00:14:35.008 --> 00:14:38.130
Yes, human consciousness is
in the loop, but hear me out.

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:41.070
If you buy the many worlds
interpretation of quantum

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.710
mechanics, it means that all
possible outcomes are really

00:14:43.710 --> 00:14:44.585
happening somewhere."

00:14:44.585 --> 00:14:46.668
NICOLE GALLAND: "There's
one world with a live cat

00:14:46.668 --> 00:14:47.880
and another with a dead cat."

00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:48.570
NEAL STEPHENSON: "Exactly.

00:14:48.570 --> 00:14:49.260
No kidding.

00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:52.620
Complete, fully independent
realities that are the same,

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:55.410
except that in one of them, the
cat's dead, and in the other,

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:56.070
it's alive.

00:14:56.070 --> 00:14:58.290
In the quantum
superposition, that just

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.210
means that the
scientist standing there

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:03.330
with his hand on the lid of the
box is at a fork in the road.

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.150
Both paths, both
worlds are open to him.

00:15:06.150 --> 00:15:08.400
He could shunt into
one or the other.

00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:11.340
And when he hauls the lid
open, the decision gets made.

00:15:11.340 --> 00:15:12.990
He's now in one
world or the other,

00:15:12.990 --> 00:15:14.250
and there's no going back."

00:15:14.250 --> 00:15:16.950
NICOLE GALLAND: "'OK,' I said,
not in the sense of I agree

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:19.610
with you, but in the sense
of I am paying attention."

00:15:19.610 --> 00:15:21.484
NEAL STEPHENSON: "The
scientist can't control

00:15:21.484 --> 00:15:23.182
which path he or she takes."

00:15:23.182 --> 00:15:25.140
NICOLE GALLAND: "I saw
that he was trolling me,

00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.960
waiting for me to
pick up the bait.

00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:29.280
No, it was more than that.

00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.140
He wanted me to
mention a possibility

00:15:31.140 --> 00:15:33.960
that he could think about but
never say out loud, because he

00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:35.760
was all Mr. Science.

00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:36.960
So I did.

00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:38.850
Let's switch it up a
little, then, I said,

00:15:38.850 --> 00:15:42.300
and swap out the white lab
coat and the clipboard for--

00:15:42.300 --> 00:15:44.760
I don't know-- a pointy
black hat and a broom,

00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:48.660
and lose a pronoun, if she
did somehow have the ability

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.460
to choose which
world she was going

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:53.970
to be shunted to when she opened
the lid, if she could control

00:15:53.970 --> 00:15:54.597
the outcome."

00:15:54.597 --> 00:15:56.430
NEAL STEPHENSON: "It
would look like magic."

00:15:56.430 --> 00:15:57.120
NICOLE GALLAND: "What
do you mean look like?

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:58.350
It would be magic."

00:15:58.350 --> 00:15:59.975
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Just saying that it's

00:15:59.975 --> 00:16:03.240
about choosing possible
outcomes that already exist,

00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:06.480
slipstreaming between closely
related alternate realities

00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.772
as opposed to bringing those
realities into existence."

00:16:08.772 --> 00:16:10.479
NICOLE GALLAND: "But
that's a distinction

00:16:10.479 --> 00:16:11.520
without a difference."

00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:13.978
NEAL STEPHENSON: "As far as
normal observers are concerned,

00:16:13.978 --> 00:16:16.142
people who haven't studied
quantum physics, sure."

00:16:16.142 --> 00:16:17.850
NICOLE GALLAND: "Put
it however you like.

00:16:17.850 --> 00:16:20.190
A witch may summon
the desired effect

00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:23.070
from a parallel/simultaneous
reality.

00:16:23.070 --> 00:16:25.650
Thus, the historical
references of witches' magic

00:16:25.650 --> 00:16:27.550
as summoning-- that
is quite literally

00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:28.860
what they were doing."

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.965
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"My hypothesis."

00:16:30.965 --> 00:16:33.090
NICOLE GALLAND: "Tristan
said, pronouncing the word

00:16:33.090 --> 00:16:36.549
with exaggerated care, since
he had a few beers in him."

00:16:36.549 --> 00:16:38.090
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Is that photography

00:16:38.090 --> 00:16:41.060
disables this summoning,
as you called it.

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:43.970
Photography breaks
magic by embalming

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:46.460
a specific moment, one
version of reality,

00:16:46.460 --> 00:16:48.320
into a recorded image.

00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.630
Once that moment is
so recorded, then

00:16:50.630 --> 00:16:53.000
all other possible
versions of that moment

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.057
are excluded from the world
that contains that photograph."

00:16:56.057 --> 00:16:57.140
NICOLE GALLAND: "I get it.

00:16:57.140 --> 00:17:00.620
There's no wiggle room left in
which to function magically.

00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:01.400
He nodded.

00:17:01.400 --> 00:17:04.460
He seemed relieved to have
got all of this off his chest

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.930
and that I hadn't laughed
him out of the room.

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.859
'You've been thinking about
this for a while,' I said.

00:17:09.859 --> 00:17:11.300
He nodded.

00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:13.220
But it wasn't until we
saw the daguerreotype

00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:15.290
of the solar eclipse
that the penny dropped."

00:17:15.290 --> 00:17:16.819
NEAL STEPHENSON: "That's right."

00:17:16.819 --> 00:17:18.985
NICOLE GALLAND: "That was
only about the bazillionth

00:17:18.985 --> 00:17:20.060
daguerreotype ever made.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:22.670
People had been taking
photographs for 16 years

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:23.480
by that point.

00:17:23.480 --> 00:17:25.190
What's so special
about that one?"

00:17:25.190 --> 00:17:26.606
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"The scope of it,

00:17:26.606 --> 00:17:30.260
I think, the number of
minds and worlds affected.

00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:33.890
If I'm Louis Daguerre screwing
around in my lab in Paris,

00:17:33.890 --> 00:17:36.080
taking pictures of
whatever's handy,

00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:38.090
then I'd collapse
the waveform, yes,

00:17:38.090 --> 00:17:40.670
but only in as much as
it encompasses my brain

00:17:40.670 --> 00:17:42.980
and a few little
objects in my lab.

00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:46.310
If I showed the daguerreotype
to my wife or my friend,

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:49.500
then the effect spreads
to them as well,

00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.950
and we can guess that witches
who live in the neighborhood

00:17:51.950 --> 00:17:54.980
might sense a dampening
of their magical abilities

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:56.540
without understanding why.

00:17:56.540 --> 00:18:00.590
But the total eclipse of
the sun on July 28, 1851,

00:18:00.590 --> 00:18:03.530
was probably witnessed
by more human beings

00:18:03.530 --> 00:18:06.230
than any other event in
the history of the world up

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:06.890
to that point."

00:18:06.890 --> 00:18:07.490
NICOLE GALLAND: "Of course.

00:18:07.490 --> 00:18:09.050
Everyone in Europe
could see it."

00:18:09.050 --> 00:18:10.550
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"Just by looking up

00:18:10.550 --> 00:18:13.210
into the sky, hundreds of
millions of people, Mel.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:16.010
That event captured more
eyeballs at the same moment

00:18:16.010 --> 00:18:18.530
than any Beyonce
video on YouTube,

00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:21.230
and to the extent that
it was frozen and bombed

00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:22.610
on a daguerreotype, well--"

00:18:22.610 --> 00:18:24.609
NICOLE GALLAND: "If
previous uses of photography

00:18:24.609 --> 00:18:27.320
had dampened magic, then this
was like dumping the Atlantic

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.250
Ocean on it."

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:29.666
NEAL STEPHENSON:
"When the shutter

00:18:29.666 --> 00:18:32.570
opened to capture that first
perfect image of the eclipse,

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:36.472
magic ceased to function
across all human societies."

00:18:36.472 --> 00:18:38.930
NICOLE GALLAND: "We back checked
the dates of all documents

00:18:38.930 --> 00:18:40.250
from 1851.

00:18:40.250 --> 00:18:43.250
Indeed, there were three from
the first half of the year, two

00:18:43.250 --> 00:18:44.630
English, one Italian.

00:18:44.630 --> 00:18:47.990
There was a fragment of one
in late July, Hungarian.

00:18:47.990 --> 00:18:51.802
There were none after July 28th,
the date of the eclipse, none."

00:18:51.802 --> 00:18:53.010
NEAL STEPHENSON: "That said."

00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.968
NICOLE GALLAND: "Muttered
Tristan, preoccupied,

00:18:54.968 --> 00:18:55.830
getting to his feet.

00:18:55.830 --> 00:18:58.160
He rested his hands on his
desk and stared absently

00:18:58.160 --> 00:18:59.510
at the wall.

00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.280
'Yes,' I said.

00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.240
I felt deflated.

00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:04.160
Although he'd never
told me why D.O.D.O. was

00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.390
so interested in
understanding magic,

00:19:06.390 --> 00:19:08.270
common sense screamed
it was because they

00:19:08.270 --> 00:19:10.550
wanted to be able to do it.

00:19:10.550 --> 00:19:13.280
Department of Doing the Occult?

00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:14.877
Which clearly
could never happen.

00:19:14.877 --> 00:19:16.460
There's no getting
rid of photography,

00:19:16.460 --> 00:19:19.010
so there's no
bringing magic back.

00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:20.840
Tristan froze, and
after a beat, jerked

00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:22.689
his head in my direction."

00:19:22.689 --> 00:19:23.980
NEAL STEPHENSON: "You're right.

00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:24.740
That's it.

00:19:24.740 --> 00:19:28.560
Where there is no photography,
there could still be magic."

00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:30.710
NICOLE GALLAND: "That's
not quite what I said.

00:19:30.710 --> 00:19:32.364
He began to pace the office.

00:19:32.364 --> 00:19:34.280
We had made it somewhat
larger by knocking out

00:19:34.280 --> 00:19:36.890
walls that separated it
from adjoining spaces,

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:38.420
but this still
required following

00:19:38.420 --> 00:19:41.750
a figure 8-ish path between
piles of books, artifacts,

00:19:41.750 --> 00:19:44.000
freestanding gun
safes to be recycled,

00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.830
beer bottles, and
still unexplained high

00:19:45.830 --> 00:19:47.360
tech military gear."

00:19:47.360 --> 00:19:50.120
NEAL STEPHENSON: "How do
we get rid of photography?"

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.362
NICOLE GALLAND: "We cannot
get rid of photography."

00:19:52.362 --> 00:19:54.320
NEAL STEPHENSON: "No,
it's definitely possible.

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:56.360
I just have to figure
out how it's done."

00:19:56.360 --> 00:19:58.010
NICOLE GALLAND: "What do
you mean how it's done?"

00:19:58.010 --> 00:19:59.801
NEAL STEPHENSON: "I'm
not seeing something.

00:19:59.801 --> 00:20:01.010
What am I missing?"

00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:02.030
NICOLE GALLAND: "You're
missing the part where

00:20:02.030 --> 00:20:04.280
photography became
ubiquitous, and all magic

00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:06.980
went away forever.

00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:09.740
He turned to look at me, his
eyes focused now and bright."

00:20:09.740 --> 00:20:11.907
NEAL STEPHENSON: "No,
it's not a lost cause."

00:20:11.907 --> 00:20:13.490
NICOLE GALLAND: "That
was not the tone

00:20:13.490 --> 00:20:15.500
of hypothesis or theory.

00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:18.410
That was the tone of
either faith or knowledge.

00:20:18.410 --> 00:20:21.620
I felt a shiver
run down my spine.

00:20:21.620 --> 00:20:24.530
I realized there are a lot
of things you can't tell me,

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:26.720
but whatever it
specifically is you're not

00:20:26.720 --> 00:20:29.930
telling me at this precise
moment, fucking tell me.

00:20:29.930 --> 00:20:32.060
Otherwise, I'm useless.

00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.920
His gaze went fuzzy
again as he engaged

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.960
in some brief mental soliloquy.

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.944
Then he nodded."

00:20:36.944 --> 00:20:38.610
NEAL STEPHENSON: "I
can't tell you much.

00:20:38.610 --> 00:20:41.915
But I can tell you that
we know it's possible."

00:20:41.915 --> 00:20:42.790
NICOLE GALLAND: "We?"

00:20:42.790 --> 00:20:45.620
NEAL STEPHENSON: "D.O.D.O.
There's evidence.

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:48.483
That's all I can say."

00:20:48.483 --> 00:20:49.274
NICOLE GALLAND: OK.

00:20:49.274 --> 00:20:51.357
NEAL STEPHENSON: So that's
the end of the reading.

00:20:51.357 --> 00:20:53.060
[APPLAUSE]

00:20:53.060 --> 00:20:56.050
Thanks.

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:58.470
So that's kind of the
setup for the story.

00:20:58.470 --> 00:20:59.820
That's all the first 30 or so--

00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:01.820
NICOLE GALLAND: And then
there's still all that.

00:21:01.820 --> 00:21:02.810
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah.

00:21:02.810 --> 00:21:03.900
Yeah.

00:21:03.900 --> 00:21:06.970
So this is the point where
we normally jump over

00:21:06.970 --> 00:21:08.640
to question and answer time.

00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:12.540
So I believe we have some
kind of bouncing cube

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:16.560
that is going to be
used to facilitate that.

00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.170
Thanks for turning
up the lights.

00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:22.770
Well, it is quite a sort
of empty band in the middle

00:21:22.770 --> 00:21:23.580
of the room there.

00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:25.455
We've definitely got
back of the bus people--

00:21:25.455 --> 00:21:27.246
NICOLE GALLAND: If this
was a folk concert,

00:21:27.246 --> 00:21:29.600
we would encourage you all
to move down to the front.

00:21:29.600 --> 00:21:33.200
NEAL STEPHENSON: Fortunately,
it's not a folk--

00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:34.885
yeah.

00:21:34.885 --> 00:21:36.510
SPEAKER: So we have
this throwable mic,

00:21:36.510 --> 00:21:38.009
which you've probably
seen if you've

00:21:38.009 --> 00:21:40.440
been to any of these events
in the last month or so.

00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:41.280
So does anyone have a question?

00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:42.571
NICOLE GALLAND: That's so cool.

00:21:45.075 --> 00:21:46.450
AUDIENCE: So now
I know, I guess,

00:21:46.450 --> 00:21:50.170
why Google sold off
our satellite business.

00:21:50.170 --> 00:21:52.720
[INAUDIBLE] next, I guess.

00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.660
So how do you guys collaborate
on a book like this?

00:21:55.660 --> 00:21:58.150
Did you work together, or
did you do it remotely?

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.690
Did you do a chapter at a time?

00:21:59.690 --> 00:22:01.840
NEAL STEPHENSON:
So we keep saying

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:05.230
that we need to fabricate a
bunch of stories about all

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:08.800
the drama and tension
that existed and made it

00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:11.830
such a thrill-charged
collaboration.

00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:15.880
But it was pretty
calm, professional.

00:22:15.880 --> 00:22:19.840
There was the idea, which came
from an idea I came up with,

00:22:19.840 --> 00:22:21.554
and we developed it
to a certain point,

00:22:21.554 --> 00:22:23.470
where we kind of knew
who the characters were.

00:22:23.470 --> 00:22:25.940
We had a sense of what
kind of people they were

00:22:25.940 --> 00:22:28.060
and the overall
arc of the story.

00:22:28.060 --> 00:22:33.097
And then Nikki kind of would
break trail, for the most part.

00:22:33.097 --> 00:22:34.930
NICOLE GALLAND: I would
play around with it,

00:22:34.930 --> 00:22:37.430
and then when I felt like I had
gotten it as far as I could,

00:22:37.430 --> 00:22:38.530
I'd pass it back to Neal.

00:22:38.530 --> 00:22:39.934
Neal would tweak it.

00:22:39.934 --> 00:22:41.350
There were some
things, especially

00:22:41.350 --> 00:22:42.891
like the section
you just read, which

00:22:42.891 --> 00:22:44.860
there's a lot of
quantum theory there,

00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.020
which Neal's a little more
comfortable than I am.

00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:51.020
So he broke ground on
those parts of that

00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:52.250
and then would send it to me.

00:22:52.250 --> 00:22:54.170
So it really was-- it
was very intuitive.

00:22:54.170 --> 00:22:56.830
It just seemed very
obvious to both of us

00:22:56.830 --> 00:23:01.360
who was better prepared in
terms of schedule and expertise

00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:04.210
or even just the kind of
voice we were creating.

00:23:04.210 --> 00:23:07.939
So whoever it made sense
to start would start,

00:23:07.939 --> 00:23:09.730
and then the other
person would do pick up.

00:23:09.730 --> 00:23:11.230
So we both ended up--

00:23:11.230 --> 00:23:13.789
our fingerprints are all
over the whole thing,

00:23:13.789 --> 00:23:14.830
both of our fingerprints.

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.682
But it was really--
it was very intuitive.

00:23:17.682 --> 00:23:18.640
Actually, that's a lie.

00:23:18.640 --> 00:23:20.080
He kept me locked
in his basement

00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.472
and fed me chocolate whenever
I finished a chapter.

00:23:23.472 --> 00:23:25.180
NEAL STEPHENSON: It's
an epistolary book,

00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:31.480
so it's written as a series of
documents that were allegedly

00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:33.280
extracted from an
archive that was

00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:35.150
stolen from this organization.

00:23:35.150 --> 00:23:39.730
So what you've been hearing
is a little bit anomalous

00:23:39.730 --> 00:23:43.100
in that it's an extended
narrative written by one voice.

00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.400
But there's big sections
of the book that

00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:49.390
are in the form of text message
exchanges or transcripts

00:23:49.390 --> 00:23:54.460
or email threads or Slack
messages or PowerPoint

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:55.480
presentations.

00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:59.290
Kind of the whole bureaucratic
communication apparatus

00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:04.580
ends up making an
appearance in this book.

00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:05.246
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:24:05.246 --> 00:24:07.110
Oh.

00:24:07.110 --> 00:24:08.840
Besides the how, why?

00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:09.340
Why?

00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.010
What made the two
of you think this

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:14.230
was a book that really needed
somebody else's voice, somebody

00:24:14.230 --> 00:24:16.624
else's input?

00:24:16.624 --> 00:24:18.790
NEAL STEPHENSON: Well, we
worked together previously

00:24:18.790 --> 00:24:25.360
on another big collaborative
project called "The Mongoliad,"

00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:29.560
so we kind of had a
sense that it could work.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:32.956
And this just--

00:24:32.956 --> 00:24:36.557
I mean the original idea kind
of came to me as I said--

00:24:36.557 --> 00:24:38.140
as I started thinking
about what would

00:24:38.140 --> 00:24:41.050
be entailed in actually
making it into a novel.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:44.860
And it just seemed to me like a
completely obvious opportunity

00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:50.110
to collaborate with Nikki
again, since her metier is

00:24:50.110 --> 00:24:56.817
writing well-researched
historical novels.

00:24:56.817 --> 00:24:58.900
NICOLE GALLAND: He twisted
my arm, and I said yes.

00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:02.772
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:06.670
AUDIENCE: So I don't want
to give any spoilers,

00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:10.980
but I'm seeing some relationship
to "Anathem" in this.

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.476
I won't say what.

00:25:13.476 --> 00:25:14.850
Without giving it
away, should we

00:25:14.850 --> 00:25:18.100
be keeping our eye open
for any Easter eggs?

00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.100
NEAL STEPHENSON: No,
there's none of that stuff.

00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.650
But you're correct
about the connection.

00:25:22.650 --> 00:25:27.070
So when I was
working on "Anathem,"

00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.770
I got interested in this whole
many worlds interpretation

00:25:31.770 --> 00:25:34.890
of quantum mechanics
and learned that there's

00:25:34.890 --> 00:25:37.650
a branch of metaphysics,
so there are still

00:25:37.650 --> 00:25:41.260
people who do metaphysics
for a living, it turns out.

00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.770
And some of them think
about alternate worlds

00:25:43.770 --> 00:25:46.350
or possible worlds
in a very serious way

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:55.200
like with logical formalism,
and so it's a thing.

00:25:55.200 --> 00:25:57.930
And it stuck with
me a little bit,

00:25:57.930 --> 00:26:02.400
and so I think you're right in
seeing that kind of connection.

00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.130
But there's not the
other kind of connection

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:06.131
that you're thinking of.

00:26:06.131 --> 00:26:07.796
NICOLE GALLAND: I
have a little anecdote

00:26:07.796 --> 00:26:09.930
I can add to that, which
is the first two times--

00:26:09.930 --> 00:26:12.210
you're not the first person
that's pointed that out--

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:15.060
but the first two times,
someone in the audience

00:26:15.060 --> 00:26:19.290
asked Neal about that, like
it hadn't occurred to him.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:21.300
It's occurred to him
now, because he's been

00:26:21.300 --> 00:26:22.800
reminded of it enough times.

00:26:25.027 --> 00:26:26.110
NEAL STEPHENSON: Oh, good.

00:26:26.110 --> 00:26:28.450
It finally went airborne.

00:26:28.450 --> 00:26:28.950
Just--

00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:34.480
AUDIENCE: Keeping to
the theme of connections

00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:38.710
on to earlier books,
any chance Enoch Root

00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:41.320
is walking around
in 1851 in London?

00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:43.600
And if not, any chance
we'll get the final third

00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:46.750
of "Cryptonomicon?"

00:26:46.750 --> 00:26:48.250
NEAL STEPHENSON: Nope.

00:26:48.250 --> 00:26:53.800
I mean it is not connected
to my other books.

00:26:53.800 --> 00:26:56.770
There's no Enoch
Root in this one.

00:26:56.770 --> 00:27:02.500
And no, it's a standalone.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:06.010
I mean there may be--
there already are

00:27:06.010 --> 00:27:11.080
other spin-outs of this book.

00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:17.570
So we struck up a relationship
with a startup called Bound.

00:27:17.570 --> 00:27:23.950
It's getbound.io, which they're
making an app for reading,

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:31.690
for enjoying fiction either by
reading it or listening to it.

00:27:31.690 --> 00:27:34.160
And they're sort of coming
out of a gaming background.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.826
So I think they were
originally thinking

00:27:35.826 --> 00:27:38.880
of adding narrative
content to game worlds,

00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.860
but it was a really good fit
for what we wanted to do.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:45.090
And so they launched on Tuesday.

00:27:45.090 --> 00:27:49.090
They're on the App Store.

00:27:49.090 --> 00:27:51.380
I don't know if they've
got an Android app.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:57.190
Anyway, the point is that there
are some other writers who've

00:27:57.190 --> 00:28:00.970
been playing in this world
already during the last year

00:28:00.970 --> 00:28:05.730
or so, and so Bound is going
to be episodically releasing

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:10.600
some of their work, which
purports to be other leaked

00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:13.210
material from the same archive.

00:28:13.210 --> 00:28:15.969
But it's different characters
and different stories.

00:28:15.969 --> 00:28:17.760
NICOLE GALLAND: Different
narratives, yeah.

00:28:17.760 --> 00:28:19.218
NEAL STEPHENSON:
But no Enoch Root.

00:28:19.218 --> 00:28:21.160
NICOLE GALLAND: And also
different documents.

00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:26.780
Are the bureaucratic
documents going into Bound's--

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:30.170
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, the
sexual harassment policy is up,

00:28:30.170 --> 00:28:32.280
I think.

00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:37.397
A bunch of the sort of
bureaucratic type things are.

00:28:37.397 --> 00:28:38.980
NICOLE GALLAND: So
I did some of that,

00:28:38.980 --> 00:28:40.810
and then we had six
other writers contribute.

00:28:40.810 --> 00:28:41.920
So there's a whole lot of--

00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.294
literally a lot of different
voices involved in that one.

00:28:44.294 --> 00:28:47.710
And it's expanding
gradually through time.

00:28:50.370 --> 00:28:51.870
NEAL STEPHENSON:
I'll heave it back.

00:28:51.870 --> 00:28:54.250
Someone will catch it.

00:28:54.250 --> 00:28:55.880
No?

00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.040
No, I guess if they were--

00:28:59.231 --> 00:29:00.730
AUDIENCE: Stylistically,
how did you

00:29:00.730 --> 00:29:03.200
choose to do
bureaucratic documents?

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:04.449
That's not--

00:29:04.449 --> 00:29:05.740
NEAL STEPHENSON: Really boring.

00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:07.660
AUDIENCE: --a
traditional novel style.

00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:11.422
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Well, you've got to--

00:29:11.422 --> 00:29:16.210
I mean so as I
think you can sense,

00:29:16.210 --> 00:29:19.060
the overall tone of this
book is more lighthearted

00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:20.625
satirical fun--

00:29:20.625 --> 00:29:22.250
NICOLE GALLAND: Than,
say, "Seveneves."

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:24.700
NEAL STEPHENSON: Right, yeah.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:33.730
So it's an opportunity to kind
of make fun of that stuff.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:37.870
So hopefully, in those
parts of the document that

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:40.310
are like PowerPoint
presentations,

00:29:40.310 --> 00:29:42.820
they're sufficiently
over the top

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:47.812
that they'll actually
be enjoyable to read.

00:29:47.812 --> 00:29:50.020
NICOLE GALLAND: Neal did a
lot of the original drafts

00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:53.140
of those, and when I got them,
I was laughing out loud, which

00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:55.300
normally doesn't happen
when I'm reading PowerPoint

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:56.596
presentations.

00:30:02.015 --> 00:30:03.390
NEAL STEPHENSON:
In front of you.

00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:06.020
NICOLE GALLAND: Throw
that man a cube.

00:30:06.020 --> 00:30:08.150
AUDIENCE: So I think you
tried something similar

00:30:08.150 --> 00:30:09.690
with "Seveneves,"
where "Seveneves"

00:30:09.690 --> 00:30:12.660
was sort of an anchor in
a universe around which

00:30:12.660 --> 00:30:16.070
ancillary projects
were scattered.

00:30:16.070 --> 00:30:17.747
Is that working out well?

00:30:17.747 --> 00:30:19.830
You're doing the same thing
again, so I assume so.

00:30:21.800 --> 00:30:23.300
NEAL STEPHENSON:
I'm trying to think

00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:29.330
of the ancillary
"Seveneves" projects.

00:30:34.010 --> 00:30:37.636
I mean I'm always
thinking about it.

00:30:37.636 --> 00:30:41.860
It seems like something
that ought to work.

00:30:41.860 --> 00:30:45.500
And I feel like I'm in a good,
relatively privileged position

00:30:45.500 --> 00:30:48.215
to be able to try to make
that kind of thing work.

00:30:48.215 --> 00:30:50.436
But then it always turns
out to be really hard,

00:30:50.436 --> 00:30:52.310
and writing novels and
getting them published

00:30:52.310 --> 00:30:54.620
turns out to be really easy.

00:30:54.620 --> 00:30:58.670
So in the case of "Seveneves,"
there is a film adaptation

00:30:58.670 --> 00:31:01.520
under way, and that
seems to be moving along

00:31:01.520 --> 00:31:02.600
in a promising way.

00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:09.020
But what tends to happen is
that if something like that

00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:12.730
gets going, it has a
suppressing effect on everything

00:31:12.730 --> 00:31:18.580
else, because why bother
trying to work on anything

00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:21.510
else like a game
or what have you

00:31:21.510 --> 00:31:24.070
if there's a
possibility that a movie

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:25.630
project is going to happen?

00:31:25.630 --> 00:31:29.440
So it causes everything
else to be sort of abandoned

00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:34.570
or put on hold while you wait
for the next thing to move.

00:31:34.570 --> 00:31:38.990
In the case of the
Bound collaboration,

00:31:38.990 --> 00:31:43.600
so far, that's not happening,
because the timing just

00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:47.080
happened to work out really
well that they had a startup.

00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:50.380
They wanted to launch their
app at exactly the same time

00:31:50.380 --> 00:31:52.330
as the book was going to launch.

00:31:52.330 --> 00:31:56.230
And so it's out there.

00:31:56.230 --> 00:31:58.390
We'll see how it develops.

00:32:06.027 --> 00:32:08.360
NICOLE GALLAND: Can you just
like throw it up in the air

00:32:08.360 --> 00:32:09.754
so we can have--

00:32:09.754 --> 00:32:10.670
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah.

00:32:10.670 --> 00:32:12.860
We were told there was
going to be a flying cube.

00:32:12.860 --> 00:32:13.542
OK.

00:32:13.542 --> 00:32:14.157
Well.

00:32:14.157 --> 00:32:15.240
NICOLE GALLAND: Thank you.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:17.210
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, thanks.

00:32:17.210 --> 00:32:19.340
AUDIENCE: So what's
the best book

00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:22.189
you've read in the last year
that's not one of your own?

00:32:22.189 --> 00:32:23.480
NEAL STEPHENSON: The last year.

00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.355
NICOLE GALLAND: Oh, this
is one of those deer

00:32:25.355 --> 00:32:26.585
in headlight questions.

00:32:26.585 --> 00:32:27.710
AUDIENCE: I mean, whatever.

00:32:27.710 --> 00:32:30.370
A book that you read in the
last year that you really liked.

00:32:30.370 --> 00:32:31.917
Doesn't have to be the best.

00:32:31.917 --> 00:32:34.250
NEAL STEPHENSON: No, it's
just this comes up every time,

00:32:34.250 --> 00:32:37.220
and every time, we
say we really should

00:32:37.220 --> 00:32:41.120
have a prepped answer for this.

00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:41.990
And then--

00:32:41.990 --> 00:32:44.090
AUDIENCE: Better than
watching [INAUDIBLE]

00:32:44.090 --> 00:32:46.820
NEAL STEPHENSON: It's terrible,
because it's an opportunity

00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:50.820
to support somebody else's work.

00:32:50.820 --> 00:32:54.380
And-- oh, see, I
finally thought of one.

00:32:54.380 --> 00:33:00.185
Annalee Newitz has
one that's coming out.

00:33:00.185 --> 00:33:03.000
I can't remember
the title of it.

00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:05.490
That's terrible.

00:33:05.490 --> 00:33:09.570
But if only there was
some kind of search engine

00:33:09.570 --> 00:33:10.445
that could find this.

00:33:10.445 --> 00:33:11.695
NICOLE GALLAND: In your brain?

00:33:11.695 --> 00:33:12.940
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah.

00:33:12.940 --> 00:33:14.190
NICOLE GALLAND: There will be.

00:33:14.190 --> 00:33:16.950
NEAL STEPHENSON: So Newitz,
N-E-W-I-T-Z, first name,

00:33:16.950 --> 00:33:24.210
Annalee, A-N-N-A-L-E-E.
And I think it's just out,

00:33:24.210 --> 00:33:27.420
so so that's worth checking out.

00:33:27.420 --> 00:33:32.880
It's her first book, so
should be easy to find on Bing

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:34.442
or whatever.

00:33:34.442 --> 00:33:36.900
NICOLE GALLAND: I know what
the most interesting thing I've

00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.910
read in the last year
is, but I guarantee you

00:33:38.910 --> 00:33:41.150
it will not be of
interest to any of you.

00:33:41.150 --> 00:33:43.770
So it's the town
report for the Town

00:33:43.770 --> 00:33:46.530
of West Tisbury,
Massachusetts, which

00:33:46.530 --> 00:33:49.020
is research for a project
I'm working on now.

00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:50.537
And it's really like--

00:33:50.537 --> 00:33:52.620
AUDIENCE: OK, so why was
that so interesting then?

00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:53.786
NICOLE GALLAND: Sorry, what?

00:33:53.786 --> 00:33:57.380
AUDIENCE: Why was that the most
interesting thing you read?

00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.910
NICOLE GALLAND: Because it--

00:33:58.910 --> 00:34:01.940
because it fed research
that I was trying to do,

00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:02.850
and it forced me--

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:04.670
I grew up in the
town of West Tisbury,

00:34:04.670 --> 00:34:08.929
and it forced me to step back
and look at my own microcosm

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.840
as a thing that could be studied
as opposed to just a place

00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:14.969
to live in.

00:34:14.969 --> 00:34:17.909
But it made me bend
my brain in a new way.

00:34:17.909 --> 00:34:20.263
But A, I'm almost
the only person

00:34:20.263 --> 00:34:21.679
that it would have
that effect on.

00:34:21.679 --> 00:34:25.449
And you guys have probably never
even heard of West Tisbury, so.

00:34:28.669 --> 00:34:30.627
AUDIENCE: What year
is the report from?

00:34:30.627 --> 00:34:32.460
NEAL STEPHENSON: They're
going to go get it.

00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:33.372
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:33.372 --> 00:34:35.080
AUDIENCE: Is that like
a recent thing or?

00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:37.350
NICOLE GALLAND: Yeah, it's 2016.

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.040
It's the town report for the
town of West Tisbury, 2016.

00:34:40.040 --> 00:34:40.840
NEAL STEPHENSON: How long is it?

00:34:40.840 --> 00:34:41.870
NICOLE GALLAND: It's about--

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:42.560
it's about that thick.

00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:43.435
NEAL STEPHENSON: Wow.

00:34:43.435 --> 00:34:47.110
NICOLE GALLAND: It's like
one Neal Stephenson chapter.

00:34:47.110 --> 00:34:49.364
NEAL STEPHENSON: So there's
another interesting thing

00:34:49.364 --> 00:34:50.030
that's happened.

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.488
It's not-- I don't think it
was published in the last year,

00:34:52.488 --> 00:34:55.610
but Matt Ruff, R-U-F-F, has a
really interesting book called

00:34:55.610 --> 00:35:02.120
"Lovecraft Country," which is
hard to encapsulate the story.

00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.210
But it's a brilliant,
weird idea.

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:10.190
And just-- it just was
announced a couple of weeks

00:35:10.190 --> 00:35:13.680
ago that it's going to
be a television series.

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:15.530
So that's worth checking out.

00:35:15.530 --> 00:35:19.950
You can say that you read
the book before it was on TV.

00:35:19.950 --> 00:35:23.990
AUDIENCE: Is the Annalee
Newitz book, "Autonomous?"

00:35:23.990 --> 00:35:25.820
NEAL STEPHENSON:
That sounds right.

00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:29.210
Part of my problem is that
they send these things to me

00:35:29.210 --> 00:35:32.155
to blurb, and sometimes
they have different titles.

00:35:32.155 --> 00:35:32.780
AUDIENCE: Sure.

00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:34.319
NEAL STEPHENSON:
So like I blurbed--

00:35:34.319 --> 00:35:35.360
that's another good one--

00:35:35.360 --> 00:35:39.374
Cory Doctorow's book, which
is now called "Walkaway."

00:35:39.374 --> 00:35:41.165
When I blurbed it, it
was called, "Utopia."

00:35:43.770 --> 00:35:44.580
So.

00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:49.160
And there's one coming
out in September

00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:54.020
by Joe Brassey, who's one of
the other "Mongoliad" writers

00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:59.180
called "Skyfarer," which is just
a great, fun adventure sci-fi

00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.114
fantasy novel, so.

00:36:02.114 --> 00:36:03.530
NICOLE GALLAND:
You've been better

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:05.000
at reading new stuff than me.

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.570
I'm like in hermit
mode at the moment.

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:12.462
NEAL STEPHENSON: Nice.

00:36:12.462 --> 00:36:13.670
AUDIENCE: That made me think.

00:36:13.670 --> 00:36:19.370
What genres do you both read
for both inspiration and fun?

00:36:19.370 --> 00:36:21.770
NICOLE GALLAND: I
read a huge range.

00:36:21.770 --> 00:36:26.210
When I'm working on a story
with a particular tone,

00:36:26.210 --> 00:36:29.300
I often try to stay
close to other books that

00:36:29.300 --> 00:36:31.280
are in that tone just
so that my inner voice--

00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:34.430
I tend to walk around thinking
in the voice of whatever I'm

00:36:34.430 --> 00:36:35.180
reading.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:38.812
So I try to keep the
voice fairly consistent

00:36:38.812 --> 00:36:40.520
when I'm in a certain
part of my process.

00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:44.080
But then when I'm not, I like to
go as far afield as I possibly

00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:44.580
can.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.700
So historical-- I love
historical fiction.

00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:52.740
I like some sci-fi and fantasy.

00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:55.320
I don't gobble it up
in quite the same way.

00:36:55.320 --> 00:36:57.140
I like contemporary
literary fiction

00:36:57.140 --> 00:36:59.640
and contemporary
commercial fiction,

00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:03.230
and I love kids' books.

00:37:03.230 --> 00:37:06.570
I just like being reminded
of being in that headspace.

00:37:06.570 --> 00:37:09.879
NEAL STEPHENSON: I
read a lot of history.

00:37:09.879 --> 00:37:10.670
Surprise, surprise.

00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:16.880
And some books about science.

00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:20.930
Oh, see, now it's coming to me.

00:37:20.930 --> 00:37:26.330
"Arrival of the Fittest"
by Andreas Wagner--

00:37:26.330 --> 00:37:28.540
really interesting
book about science.

00:37:28.540 --> 00:37:34.190
And it's about
the problem with--

00:37:34.190 --> 00:37:42.590
how does evolution actually
work on a combinatorial level?

00:37:42.590 --> 00:37:45.020
Just randomly
shuffling amino acids

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:47.450
around doesn't seem like
it would get you anywhere,

00:37:47.450 --> 00:37:53.010
if you look at all of the
combinations that would fail.

00:37:53.010 --> 00:37:54.920
So he's coming at--

00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.930
he's at the Santa Fe Institute.

00:37:56.930 --> 00:38:00.020
He's done all kinds of really
interesting computational work

00:38:00.020 --> 00:38:03.080
in this area and has got
a really readable book

00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:08.785
out on that topic that was
pretty amazing to read.

00:38:08.785 --> 00:38:09.660
NICOLE GALLAND: Cool.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:10.630
I read a lot of plays.

00:38:10.630 --> 00:38:12.660
I completely forgot that,
because my background

00:38:12.660 --> 00:38:14.290
is in theater,
and I can't really

00:38:14.290 --> 00:38:15.590
divorce myself from that.

00:38:15.590 --> 00:38:19.750
That's-- yeah.

00:38:19.750 --> 00:38:21.660
NEAL STEPHENSON: Anyone else?

00:38:21.660 --> 00:38:22.363
Whoops.

00:38:22.363 --> 00:38:22.796
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:22.796 --> 00:38:23.796
NEAL STEPHENSON: Oh, OK.

00:38:23.796 --> 00:38:24.300
Yeah.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:25.484
Thank you.

00:38:25.484 --> 00:38:27.150
NICOLE GALLAND: Taking
one for the team.

00:38:27.150 --> 00:38:29.149
NEAL STEPHENSON: I want
to see a perfect spiral.

00:38:32.530 --> 00:38:34.894
NICOLE GALLAND: Yeah, all right.

00:38:34.894 --> 00:38:36.395
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Now we're talking.

00:38:36.395 --> 00:38:38.520
AUDIENCE: All right, so
this was not the first book

00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:39.561
either of you've written.

00:38:39.561 --> 00:38:42.390
I assume it won't be the
last either of you write.

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:45.000
I'm just curious, what are
you looking forward to trying

00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.649
differently next time, perhaps?

00:38:47.649 --> 00:38:49.690
NEAL STEPHENSON: What are
our next book projects?

00:38:49.690 --> 00:38:52.450
AUDIENCE: Just not necessarily
what the plot is, but just

00:38:52.450 --> 00:38:54.720
what are you going to try
doing differently as you

00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:56.010
embark on your next projects?

00:38:56.010 --> 00:38:57.760
NICOLE GALLAND: I'm a
little superstitious

00:38:57.760 --> 00:39:00.930
about talking about stuff
that hasn't been birthed yet.

00:39:00.930 --> 00:39:02.454
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:39:02.454 --> 00:39:04.120
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah,
I'm the same way,

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:06.960
so I resort to generalities.

00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:11.370
So both of us are
working on solo books,

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:15.390
so although we had a
great time collaborating,

00:39:15.390 --> 00:39:18.990
that's an unnatural
state of affairs,

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:22.170
and we're both
reverting to form.

00:39:22.170 --> 00:39:23.730
So I'm working on one that is--

00:39:27.020 --> 00:39:30.350
technically, you could call
it a follow-on to "Reamde,"

00:39:30.350 --> 00:39:34.070
but it's so different
from "Reamde"

00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:35.990
that it's just going
to confuse everybody

00:39:35.990 --> 00:39:39.650
if I describe it that way.

00:39:39.650 --> 00:39:45.530
So back to more of a
contemporary near term sci-fi

00:39:45.530 --> 00:39:49.149
kind of sensibility.

00:39:49.149 --> 00:39:50.690
NICOLE GALLAND: I'm
writing something

00:39:50.690 --> 00:39:52.960
that requires me to read the
West Tisbury Town Report.

00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:01.610
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:01.610 --> 00:40:03.260
I'm wondering,
how much influence

00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:06.080
do you have over the audiobook
versions of your works?

00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:09.975
Do you work with the
narrators, or is this just--

00:40:09.975 --> 00:40:12.890
sometimes I wonder if it's this
third party's interpretation

00:40:12.890 --> 00:40:14.660
of the work that I'm
actually getting.

00:40:14.660 --> 00:40:18.140
NICOLE GALLAND: Normally, it is
a third party interpretation.

00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:21.020
In fact, for "Stepdog,"
a friend of mine who's

00:40:21.020 --> 00:40:24.020
in the industry scolded
me that I was sort

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.870
of trying to indirectly
get to the actor,

00:40:26.870 --> 00:40:30.230
because we happened to
know him a little bit.

00:40:30.230 --> 00:40:33.380
But in this particular
case, that same person

00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:35.660
is now very happy
with me, because I

00:40:35.660 --> 00:40:39.350
got her the role of Mel, the
voice that I was just reading.

00:40:39.350 --> 00:40:43.170
She is my college roommate, who
studied linguistics at Harvard,

00:40:43.170 --> 00:40:45.740
and she is now playing
the voice of a person that

00:40:45.740 --> 00:40:47.369
studied linguistics at Harvard.

00:40:47.369 --> 00:40:48.410
She's a voiceover artist.

00:40:48.410 --> 00:40:50.540
I mean I didn't just
pluck her out of nowhere.

00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:54.350
So I got to have control over
that, which was really fun.

00:40:54.350 --> 00:40:56.810
And in this particular
case, there's

00:40:56.810 --> 00:41:00.170
a few funky things
about how Mel writes.

00:41:00.170 --> 00:41:04.530
She's writing, as she says, with
a dip pen in Victorian England.

00:41:04.530 --> 00:41:06.410
So what I did not
include is that there's

00:41:06.410 --> 00:41:09.890
a few places where as she's
writing, she drops an F bomb

00:41:09.890 --> 00:41:12.260
or says something that's
very anachronistic.

00:41:12.260 --> 00:41:14.380
And then she crosses
it out, and then puts

00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:18.519
something that's more Victorian,
because she is clearly

00:41:18.519 --> 00:41:20.560
going to be stuck there
for the rest of her life.

00:41:20.560 --> 00:41:23.090
So she's trying to make
herself think like a Victorian.

00:41:23.090 --> 00:41:26.420
And so she's correcting
herself, and in the audio book,

00:41:26.420 --> 00:41:29.810
the way that they did that was
[INAUDIBLE] would start to say,

00:41:29.810 --> 00:41:31.730
"fu--" and then she'd
cut herself off,

00:41:31.730 --> 00:41:34.280
and then they added
a little sound bite

00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:39.530
that was the sound of a
pen scratching out a word.

00:41:39.530 --> 00:41:41.510
So that was-- she
came up with what

00:41:41.510 --> 00:41:43.220
she was going to do
by talking to me,

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:46.030
and then once they heard her,
they added the scratchy thing.

00:41:46.030 --> 00:41:47.196
NEAL STEPHENSON: Nice, nice.

00:41:47.196 --> 00:41:47.960
Yeah.

00:41:47.960 --> 00:41:49.790
No, it's gotten
really interesting,

00:41:49.790 --> 00:41:53.870
because it blew up into
such a big important market

00:41:53.870 --> 00:41:57.640
that a lot of smart
people are getting engaged

00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:01.610
and thinking about how to
make the process better.

00:42:01.610 --> 00:42:05.630
And so it's changed
my style a little bit,

00:42:05.630 --> 00:42:09.350
because I used to put more
diagrams and things that you

00:42:09.350 --> 00:42:11.690
can't read out loud into books.

00:42:11.690 --> 00:42:13.280
And now I don't do that.

00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:16.460
Like footnotes, for
example, are problematic.

00:42:16.460 --> 00:42:19.990
Like some actors have like their
special footnote tone of voice

00:42:19.990 --> 00:42:22.670
that they'll go into
to sort of give you

00:42:22.670 --> 00:42:24.180
a cue that this is a footnote.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:27.800
But it's still really
awkward in audio.

00:42:27.800 --> 00:42:30.640
And I just heard that--

00:42:30.640 --> 00:42:33.090
this might be
interesting to you--

00:42:33.090 --> 00:42:35.720
I can't remember if it's
Brilliance or Audible,

00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:40.940
but one of the big
audio book companies

00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:46.300
is trying to reach
out to playwrights

00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:50.780
and produce more
original content that

00:42:50.780 --> 00:42:52.672
would be more dramatic.

00:42:52.672 --> 00:42:54.380
NICOLE GALLAND: Well,
that's interesting.

00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.171
NEAL STEPHENSON: As
opposed to just reading

00:42:56.171 --> 00:42:57.980
a prose book that's
actually set up

00:42:57.980 --> 00:43:00.240
like what we used
to call a radio play

00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:04.700
and what is now
called an audio drama.

00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:06.710
So it's a huge market,
because there's

00:43:06.710 --> 00:43:12.530
all these people, like long haul
truck drivers or assembly line

00:43:12.530 --> 00:43:16.370
workers, who listen
to audio books

00:43:16.370 --> 00:43:19.290
like eight, 10, 12 hours a day.

00:43:19.290 --> 00:43:24.020
And so they have an insatiable
demand for this stuff.

00:43:24.020 --> 00:43:26.810
And so all kinds of
really interesting things

00:43:26.810 --> 00:43:29.780
are going on in that space,
and it's a cool space to be in.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.280
NICOLE GALLAND: You
just reminded me

00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:33.530
of something that's only
tangentially related,

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:34.700
historically.

00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.210
In Cuba, the cigar rollers used
to have professional readers

00:43:38.210 --> 00:43:41.750
brought over from Europe to
read them Tolstoy and things

00:43:41.750 --> 00:43:42.880
like that.

00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:44.570
So it's a grand old tradition.

00:43:44.570 --> 00:43:45.800
I'm glad it's continuing.

00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:47.810
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah,
the Monte Cristo cigar,

00:43:47.810 --> 00:43:51.770
which is one of the
best, most famous cigars,

00:43:51.770 --> 00:43:54.920
was named that,
because in that room,

00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:57.650
the favorite book of
those cigar rollers

00:43:57.650 --> 00:43:59.650
was "The Count of Monte Cristo."

00:43:59.650 --> 00:44:00.570
Yeah.

00:44:00.570 --> 00:44:01.070
Yeah.

00:44:04.170 --> 00:44:05.980
Anyone?

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.790
OK, all right.

00:44:09.350 --> 00:44:12.170
AUDIENCE: So I assume you
guys enjoy writing books,

00:44:12.170 --> 00:44:14.630
but it's also your job.

00:44:14.630 --> 00:44:16.580
So how does that
kind of play out?

00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:18.920
Is there conflict
at any time in terms

00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:20.960
of like when it ceases
to be enjoyable,

00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:25.049
and it becomes just a job?

00:44:25.049 --> 00:44:26.590
NICOLE GALLAND: I've
had just a jobs,

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:29.710
and writing is never just a job.

00:44:29.710 --> 00:44:31.690
It's a lot of work sometimes.

00:44:31.690 --> 00:44:33.130
Sometimes it's really fun.

00:44:33.130 --> 00:44:35.120
When I wrote my first
novel, "The Fool's Tale,"

00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.420
at a certain point, I went
from having writer's block

00:44:37.420 --> 00:44:38.710
to being completely obsessed.

00:44:38.710 --> 00:44:42.820
And I was writing 17 hours
a day and couldn't stop.

00:44:42.820 --> 00:44:45.250
Like the discipline
was to stop doing it

00:44:45.250 --> 00:44:48.970
and do things like eat breakfast
or take a shower or sleep.

00:44:48.970 --> 00:44:51.820
And then there's other times
that it's like pulling teeth,

00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:53.410
but neither of
those two extremes

00:44:53.410 --> 00:44:56.830
are how I've ever felt
about anything that's

00:44:56.830 --> 00:44:59.230
like a job, where you show
up somewhere and have a boss

00:44:59.230 --> 00:45:02.620
and do your job,
and then go home.

00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:06.070
So for me personally,
it's its own thing.

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:09.970
And even though it varies,
all of its various faces

00:45:09.970 --> 00:45:12.490
are set apart from
any other kind of work

00:45:12.490 --> 00:45:15.340
that I ever did before it.

00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.839
You have a different answer,
because you have a different--

00:45:17.839 --> 00:45:20.005
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah, I
figured out a long time ago

00:45:20.005 --> 00:45:21.940
that it's best if I
get up in the morning,

00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:24.820
write for a couple of hours,
maybe three hours max,

00:45:24.820 --> 00:45:29.170
and then stop, and do something
else for the rest of the day.

00:45:29.170 --> 00:45:31.780
And by something else, I mean
something that's totally not

00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:35.020
writing, something like doing
geeky things or building

00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:40.420
things, because there's a lot
that happens as a background

00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:41.080
process.

00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.710
And you've got to
allow that to happen,

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:46.750
or I have to allow
that to happen,

00:45:46.750 --> 00:45:50.260
because if I don't, then
when I get up the next day

00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:55.500
and go back to writing,
I don't have anything.

00:45:55.500 --> 00:45:58.840
So I just long ago
figured out I had

00:45:58.840 --> 00:46:03.520
to let the mysterious
background process do its thing.

00:46:03.520 --> 00:46:12.430
And then even doing two,
even one hour of work a day

00:46:12.430 --> 00:46:16.570
generates enough material
to produce a book in a year,

00:46:16.570 --> 00:46:18.310
two years easy.

00:46:18.310 --> 00:46:19.820
So it's not a--

00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:23.500
it doesn't slow things
down to take that kind

00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:26.150
of measured paced approach.

00:46:26.150 --> 00:46:29.165
But there is this weird
thing that it's like--

00:46:29.165 --> 00:46:30.790
you know, we used to
call it dieseling,

00:46:30.790 --> 00:46:33.310
where you shut your
car off, but the engine

00:46:33.310 --> 00:46:36.070
keeps running for
a little while.

00:46:36.070 --> 00:46:37.070
That happens to me.

00:46:37.070 --> 00:46:40.810
So when I stop, I have to
carry my phone around with me

00:46:40.810 --> 00:46:45.850
and do voice memos
for about 15 minutes,

00:46:45.850 --> 00:46:52.750
because I'll get like
lines of dialogue or ideas

00:46:52.750 --> 00:46:57.080
that are kind of
dieseling in my head.

00:46:57.080 --> 00:47:01.690
It's usually good stuff, and
so I'll make a record of those.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.760
And then that's where
I start the next day.

00:47:05.760 --> 00:47:07.250
So.

00:47:07.250 --> 00:47:09.010
SPEAKER: So we're
almost out of time,

00:47:09.010 --> 00:47:11.822
so if anyone has
the last question.

00:47:11.822 --> 00:47:13.780
AUDIENCE: If I can figure
out how to phrase it.

00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:15.790
This one's
specifically for Neal.

00:47:15.790 --> 00:47:18.740
You've written a lot of
pretty well-known books

00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:21.110
and have a lot of fans.

00:47:21.110 --> 00:47:23.140
And I'm wondering out
of all those books,

00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:26.819
which ones do you think has
produced the most rabid fans?

00:47:26.819 --> 00:47:28.360
NEAL STEPHENSON:
The most rabid fans?

00:47:28.360 --> 00:47:30.250
AUDIENCE: Yeah, you know,
which books are most--

00:47:30.250 --> 00:47:31.810
I don't want to say
inspiring, but--

00:47:37.029 --> 00:47:39.320
NEAL STEPHENSON: There's
different kinds of rabid fans.

00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:43.280
There's like a
taxonomy of rabid fans.

00:47:43.280 --> 00:47:48.670
So I think it seems to me
that among female readers,

00:47:48.670 --> 00:47:50.590
"Diamond Age" and
"Snow Crash" are

00:47:50.590 --> 00:47:56.170
both super popular, maybe
"Diamond Age" a little more so.

00:47:56.170 --> 00:48:00.310
And then "Cryptonomicon"
is really popular.

00:48:00.310 --> 00:48:05.550
It's just it's always a
different rabid fan kind of.

00:48:05.550 --> 00:48:06.804
What's that?

00:48:06.804 --> 00:48:07.720
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:08.636
NEAL STEPHENSON: Yeah.

00:48:08.636 --> 00:48:14.590
Yeah, and so for example, when
I published "Quicksilver,"

00:48:14.590 --> 00:48:20.080
which is my first kind of
straight up historical novel,

00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:20.620
I went.

00:48:20.620 --> 00:48:26.070
I did a tour in the UK for that,
and some guy approached me,

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:29.920
a silver-haired guy
walked up and said hello.

00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:33.730
And he had become
a fan of that book,

00:48:33.730 --> 00:48:39.400
but he had no idea I had
written anything else.

00:48:39.400 --> 00:48:42.565
So that's just kind of
how that market works

00:48:42.565 --> 00:48:43.790
for whatever reason.

00:48:47.164 --> 00:48:48.580
SPEAKER: We have
a couple minutes,

00:48:48.580 --> 00:48:49.840
so I'm going to ask
a follow-up to that,

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.760
which is, Nicole,
you're mostly known

00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:54.530
for writing historical fiction.

00:48:54.530 --> 00:48:56.530
So this is a little
out of genre.

00:48:56.530 --> 00:48:59.980
Do you find that a lot of your
fans are excited for this book

00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.100
or excited for you to do more
stuff like this that's kind

00:49:03.100 --> 00:49:05.016
of comedic or more
sci-fi-ey, or--

00:49:05.016 --> 00:49:06.140
NICOLE GALLAND: I think so.

00:49:06.140 --> 00:49:08.770
Something that I've been
trying to come to terms with

00:49:08.770 --> 00:49:12.610
is the fact that I think
I'm a little funnier than I

00:49:12.610 --> 00:49:13.270
think I am.

00:49:16.150 --> 00:49:19.240
I don't think of myself
as trying to write funny,

00:49:19.240 --> 00:49:22.240
but that seems to be a lot of
the feedback that I'm getting

00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.490
is that's part of what
people like about my writing.

00:49:24.490 --> 00:49:28.030
This is not as out of genre as
my last book, which I think we

00:49:28.030 --> 00:49:29.770
were talking about this before.

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:31.960
I wrote one contemporary
romantic comedy.

00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:35.080
It's the last book that I
wrote, and this actually

00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:41.080
feels like a return to form,
because for instance, we

00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:44.920
needed medieval warfare
for a section of this book.

00:49:44.920 --> 00:49:46.780
And so we chose
the Fourth Crusade,

00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:50.380
because I wrote a
novel called "Crossed:

00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:52.120
A Tale of the Fourth Crusade."

00:49:52.120 --> 00:49:53.770
So we were drawing--

00:49:53.770 --> 00:49:58.540
I actually got to return to a
lot of my stuff in doing this.

00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.460
"Stepdog" was the
one that just--

00:50:00.460 --> 00:50:05.020
even my editor said, well,
that came out of nowhere.

00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:08.380
So this was sort of like
a fun, playful return

00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.510
to familiar
material, but getting

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.750
to do it in a whole new way.

00:50:11.750 --> 00:50:13.820
And that was delightful.

00:50:13.820 --> 00:50:18.314
I love trying new things,
and this was just delightful.

00:50:18.314 --> 00:50:20.230
SPEAKER: Do you have you
Easter egg characters

00:50:20.230 --> 00:50:21.946
from your previous
Fourth Crusade book?

00:50:24.346 --> 00:50:25.720
NICOLE GALLAND:
I don't think so.

00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:28.390
If I do, they're buried so
deeply that I didn't even

00:50:28.390 --> 00:50:29.260
mention it to Neal.

00:50:32.950 --> 00:50:35.230
Now I'm starting to feel
like maybe there's some,

00:50:35.230 --> 00:50:36.730
but I've even buried
it from myself.

00:50:36.730 --> 00:50:40.330
NEAL STEPHENSON: You've probably
referred to important figures

00:50:40.330 --> 00:50:42.777
like the emperor, whatever,
who was mentioned.

00:50:42.777 --> 00:50:44.860
NICOLE GALLAND: Yeah, so
there's historical Easter

00:50:44.860 --> 00:50:47.300
eggs, so to speak, but not--

00:50:47.300 --> 00:50:49.917
no.

00:50:49.917 --> 00:50:50.750
No, I don't do that.

00:50:50.750 --> 00:50:53.200
But maybe I should.

00:50:53.200 --> 00:50:56.000
I shall start.

00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:57.690
SPEAKER: OK, I think
we're out of time.

00:50:57.690 --> 00:50:59.023
So thanks for coming, everybody.

00:50:59.023 --> 00:51:01.130
And Neal and Nicole
already signed a bunch

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.877
of the books that are for sale.

00:51:02.877 --> 00:51:05.210
I may have forgotten to mention
that books are for sale,

00:51:05.210 --> 00:51:07.642
so please talk to
a rep at the back.

00:51:07.642 --> 00:51:09.350
And they're going to
be here for a couple

00:51:09.350 --> 00:51:11.287
minutes if you want to say hi.

00:51:11.287 --> 00:51:12.870
NEAL STEPHENSON:
Thanks for having us.

00:51:12.870 --> 00:51:13.770
NICOLE GALLAND: Thanks
for having us, yeah.

00:51:13.770 --> 00:51:14.370
Thank you.

00:51:14.370 --> 00:51:18.020
[APPLAUSE]
