Okay, in my story I had one single stamp so I noticed that in A, B, C, and D, I

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:09.484
have a single stamp here. So the difference has to be with the piles. I made two

00:00:09.496 --> 00:00:13.774
piles of three stamps so I know I need to find 2 piles in my diagram. Answer

00:00:13.786 --> 00:00:17.810
choice B has three piles, cause I see the three red circles of two. So this one

00:00:17.822 --> 00:00:21.530
can't be right. And answer choice C, I have one pile of six. So that's not

00:00:21.542 --> 00:00:25.470
right, either. When I look at answer choice A, I have three stamps in one pile,

00:00:25.562 --> 00:00:29.380
and three stamps in another. I know that answer A has to be correct. D is not

00:00:29.392 --> 00:00:32.970
correct. I have four stamps in one pile, and two stamps in another pile.
