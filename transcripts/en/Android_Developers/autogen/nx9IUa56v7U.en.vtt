right here you know we can you can see
 

00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:43.350
right here you know we can you can see
other groupings this is tiny form you

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:43.360
other groupings this is tiny form you
 

00:02:43.360 --> 00:02:47.400

could step through your your frame and

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:49.720
could step through your your frame and
 

00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:51.840
could step through your your frame and
see how we get spelt up you see all the

course you can see their actual GL calls

00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:57.130
course you can see their actual GL calls
 

00:02:57.130 --> 00:03:01.170
course you can see their actual GL calls
as well but I need to this draw call but

00:03:01.170 --> 00:03:01.180
as well but I need to this draw call but
 

00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.870
as well but I need to this draw call but
obviously you want to also show you some

00:03:03.870 --> 00:03:03.880
obviously you want to also show you some
 

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.620
obviously you want to also show you some
more if the rest of the state of the GL

00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:07.630
more if the rest of the state of the GL
 

00:03:07.630 --> 00:03:09.240

drivers so for example we can look at

00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:09.250
drivers so for example we can look at
 

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.100
drivers so for example we can look at
the geometry that was rendered here so

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:11.110
the geometry that was rendered here so
 

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:15.900
the geometry that was rendered here so
this is just some leaves sushi here you

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:15.910
this is just some leaves sushi here you
 

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:19.319
this is just some leaves sushi here you
can see more interesting geometry and

00:03:19.319 --> 00:03:19.329
can see more interesting geometry and
 

00:03:19.329 --> 00:03:21.090
can see more interesting geometry and
you can for example the about you know

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:21.100
you can for example the about you know
 

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:22.800
you can for example the about you know
almost if they don't look okay that's

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:22.810
almost if they don't look okay that's
 

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:24.930
almost if they don't look okay that's
exactly you can inspect your geometry

00:03:24.930 --> 00:03:24.940
exactly you can inspect your geometry
 

00:03:24.940 --> 00:03:27.449
exactly you can inspect your geometry
that was rendering in this truck oh and

00:03:27.449 --> 00:03:27.459
that was rendering in this truck oh and
 

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:29.940
that was rendering in this truck oh and
we also allow you to inspect all your

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:29.950
we also allow you to inspect all your
 

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:38.930
we also allow you to inspect all your
textures and this also will show you

00:03:38.930 --> 00:03:38.940
textures and this also will show you
 

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.849
textures and this also will show you
context of texture that our render

00:03:41.849 --> 00:03:41.859
context of texture that our render
 

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:43.800
context of texture that our render
targets so which is really nice you know

00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:43.810
targets so which is really nice you know
 

00:03:43.810 --> 00:03:45.259
targets so which is really nice you know
you don't really need to render your

00:03:45.259 --> 00:03:45.269
you don't really need to render your
 

00:03:45.269 --> 00:03:47.550
you don't really need to render your
shadow map on the screen you can just

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:47.560
shadow map on the screen you can just
 

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:51.090
shadow map on the screen you can just
inspect it here and you have some image

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:51.100
inspect it here and you have some image
 

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.340
inspect it here and you have some image
tools like you can disable channels just

00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:53.350
tools like you can disable channels just
 

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:55.800
tools like you can disable channels just
again helpful for shadow map so you have

00:03:55.800 --> 00:03:55.810
again helpful for shadow map so you have
 

00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:04.280
again helpful for shadow map so you have
different values and different channels

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:04.290
 

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:06.660
of course we also show you your shaders

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:06.670
of course we also show you your shaders
 

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:10.229
of course we also show you your shaders
and one of the things we directly you

prototyping you know whenever you have

00:04:16.229 --> 00:04:16.239
prototyping you know whenever you have
 

00:04:16.239 --> 00:04:17.670
prototyping you know whenever you have
like an issue the shade and you you're

00:04:17.670 --> 00:04:17.680
like an issue the shade and you you're
 

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.379
like an issue the shade and you you're
adding a shader right you say but you

00:04:19.379 --> 00:04:19.389
adding a shader right you say but you
 

00:04:19.389 --> 00:04:20.699
adding a shader right you say but you
save it yeah so we build your

00:04:20.699 --> 00:04:20.709
save it yeah so we build your
 

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:22.290
save it yeah so we build your
application and you have to package it

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:22.300
application and you have to package it
 

00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:24.719
application and you have to package it
up deploy to device wanted just to find

00:04:24.719 --> 00:04:24.729

you know you forgot that dot zero or

00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:27.330
you know you forgot that dot zero or
 

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:29.510
you know you forgot that dot zero or
whatever so we allow you to edit the

00:04:29.510 --> 00:04:29.520
whatever so we allow you to edit the
 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:31.570
whatever so we allow you to edit the
shaders in place here so let me just

00:04:31.570 --> 00:04:31.580
shaders in place here so let me just
 

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.240
shaders in place here so let me just
paste something in your data safe before

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:34.250
paste something in your data safe before
 

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.230
paste something in your data safe before
you say you push your changes and in a

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:39.240
you say you push your changes and in a
 

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.930
you say you push your changes and in a
few seconds you can see the the changes

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:41.940
few seconds you can see the the changes
 

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.360
few seconds you can see the the changes
have happened and you know changing our

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:44.370
have happened and you know changing our
 

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.560
have happened and you know changing our
skybox here to be a nice sunset red and

00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:48.570
skybox here to be a nice sunset red and
 

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.360
skybox here to be a nice sunset red and
you can see that it has changed on all

00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:50.370
you can see that it has changed on all
 

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:52.190
you can see that it has changed on all
frames you know we've changed our full

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.200
frames you know we've changed our full
 

00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:56.510
frames you know we've changed our full
skybox would be nice at red we track the

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520
skybox would be nice at red we track the
 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.030
skybox would be nice at red we track the
entire state of the the GL driver so you

00:04:59.030 --> 00:04:59.040
entire state of the the GL driver so you
 

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.280
entire state of the the GL driver so you
can inspect it at any point in your

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:01.290
can inspect it at any point in your
 

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:03.530
can inspect it at any point in your
trace you know if you have if you see an

00:05:03.530 --> 00:05:03.540
trace you know if you have if you see an
 

00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.060
trace you know if you have if you see an
issue and you want to know what was the

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:05.070
issue and you want to know what was the
 

00:05:05.070 --> 00:05:06.710
issue and you want to know what was the
blend State at this point at trace you

00:05:06.710 --> 00:05:06.720
blend State at this point at trace you
 

00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:11.780
blend State at this point at trace you
can go in and sorry inspector trace you

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:11.790
can go in and sorry inspector trace you
 

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:13.730
can go in and sorry inspector trace you
can see the blend State for example here

00:05:13.730 --> 00:05:13.740
can see the blend State for example here
 

00:05:13.740 --> 00:05:19.040
can see the blend State for example here
for vias that you've said it was oh you

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050
for vias that you've said it was oh you
 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:22.990
for vias that you've said it was oh you
know this should be something different

00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:23.000
know this should be something different
 

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.700
know this should be something different
we we also have a beginning for

00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:25.710
we we also have a beginning for
 

00:05:25.710 --> 00:05:28.820
we we also have a beginning for
reporting system that tracks errors for

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830

example gel IRC FIFA if there's a gel

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:30.960
example gel IRC FIFA if there's a gel
 

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.270
example gel IRC FIFA if there's a gel
ever going to trace will show it here

00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:32.280
ever going to trace will show it here
 

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.980
ever going to trace will show it here
for example if there's a and you can

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:33.990
for example if there's a and you can
 

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.260
for example if there's a and you can
quickly go to the command and see that

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:36.270
quickly go to the command and see that
 

00:05:36.270 --> 00:05:40.120
quickly go to the command and see that
this get integer has an interesting

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.130
this get integer has an interesting
 

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:43.070
this get integer has an interesting
identify that doesn't exist or and we

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:43.080
identify that doesn't exist or and we
 

00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:44.420
identify that doesn't exist or and we
also planning on having other things

00:05:44.420 --> 00:05:44.430
also planning on having other things
 

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.850
also planning on having other things
that we can detect and you try saying if

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:46.860
that we can detect and you try saying if
 

00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:48.800
that we can detect and you try saying if
you action or feedback on how you can

00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:48.810
you action or feedback on how you can
 

00:05:48.810 --> 00:05:53.330
you action or feedback on how you can
improve your game call this about most

00:05:53.330 --> 00:05:53.340
improve your game call this about most
 

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:57.620
improve your game call this about most
feed you try the memory okay yeah

00:05:57.620 --> 00:05:57.630
feed you try the memory okay yeah
 

00:05:57.630 --> 00:06:00.860
feed you try the memory okay yeah
obviously for for some commands you know

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:00.870
obviously for for some commands you know
 

00:06:00.870 --> 00:06:10.490
obviously for for some commands you know
like let's just find or something like

00:06:10.490 --> 00:06:10.500
 

00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:14.360
it's you know it's it's not exactly very

00:06:14.360 --> 00:06:14.370
it's you know it's it's not exactly very
 

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:16.550
it's you know it's it's not exactly very
interesting to see the memory pointer so

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560
interesting to see the memory pointer so
 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:18.230
interesting to see the memory pointer so
we also obviously track them I mean you

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:18.240
we also obviously track them I mean you
 

00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:21.200
we also obviously track them I mean you
can see what what memory was passing and

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:21.210
can see what what memory was passing and
 

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:23.900
can see what what memory was passing and
you can do formatted in the goodbye so

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:23.910
you can do formatted in the goodbye so
 

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:25.430
you can do formatted in the goodbye so
here you can see the matrix that was

00:06:25.430 --> 00:06:25.440
here you can see the matrix that was
 

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.090
here you can see the matrix that was
passed into this uniform so the the

00:06:29.090 --> 00:06:29.100
passed into this uniform so the the
 

00:06:29.100 --> 00:06:31.160
passed into this uniform so the the
memory is the sort of power tool but for

00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:31.170
memory is the sort of power tool but for
 

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:33.740
memory is the sort of power tool but for
any particular plant the Select you can

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:33.750
any particular plant the Select you can
 

00:06:33.750 --> 00:06:35.630
any particular plant the Select you can
see all of the memory that was read or

00:06:35.630 --> 00:06:35.640
see all of the memory that was read or
 

00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.370
see all of the memory that was read or
written by that command at that point in

00:06:37.370 --> 00:06:37.380
written by that command at that point in
 

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:39.410
written by that command at that point in
the trace there's been handy for sort of

00:06:39.410 --> 00:06:39.420
the trace there's been handy for sort of
 

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:42.620
the trace there's been handy for sort of
off-by-one errors so yeah that's pretty

00:06:42.620 --> 00:06:42.630
off-by-one errors so yeah that's pretty
 

00:06:42.630 --> 00:06:44.840
off-by-one errors so yeah that's pretty
much the tool at the moment a couple of

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:44.850
much the tool at the moment a couple of
 

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:46.550
much the tool at the moment a couple of
other things we support multiple

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:46.560
other things we support multiple
 

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.940
other things we support multiple
contexts for GL the bar at the top there

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:49.950
contexts for GL the bar at the top there
 

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:53.210

it by default selects the most what we

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:53.220
it by default selects the most what we
 

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.660
it by default selects the most what we
consider the most relevant context for

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:55.670
consider the most relevant context for
 

00:06:55.670 --> 00:06:59.180
consider the most relevant context for
the particular game but for a lot of the

00:06:59.180 --> 00:06:59.190
the particular game but for a lot of the
 

00:06:59.190 --> 00:07:01.130
the particular game but for a lot of the
engines there's multiple contexts that

00:07:01.130 --> 00:07:01.140
engines there's multiple contexts that
 

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.640
engines there's multiple contexts that
spun up so you can look between them as

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:04.650
spun up so you can look between them as
 

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.130
spun up so you can look between them as
an option as well for an interleaved

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:07.140
an option as well for an interleaved
 

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:08.960
an option as well for an interleaved
context mode so that you can see how the

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:08.970
context mode so that you can see how the
 

00:07:08.970 --> 00:07:11.500
context mode so that you can see how the
contexts are talking to each other but

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:11.510
contexts are talking to each other but
 

00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:12.710
contexts are talking to each other but
yeah

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:12.720
yeah
 

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.030
yeah
that's pretty much what we have right

00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:14.040
that's pretty much what we have right
 

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:16.970
that's pretty much what we have right
now if there's any questions by the way

00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:16.980
now if there's any questions by the way

please feel free to interrupt

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:23.610
 

00:07:23.610 --> 00:07:28.140
sorry is there a like a high-resolution

00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:28.150
sorry is there a like a high-resolution
 

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:33.270
sorry is there a like a high-resolution
CPU time stamp on this sometimes it's

00:07:33.270 --> 00:07:33.280
CPU time stamp on this sometimes it's
 

00:07:33.280 --> 00:07:35.820
CPU time stamp on this sometimes it's
nice to know what you what your codes

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:35.830
nice to know what you what your codes
 

00:07:35.830 --> 00:07:38.220
nice to know what you what your codes
are doing CPU side when it's building

00:07:38.220 --> 00:07:38.230
are doing CPU side when it's building
 

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:41.430
are doing CPU side when it's building
the frame currently no we did wanna put

00:07:41.430 --> 00:07:41.440
the frame currently no we did wanna put
 

00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:44.970
the frame currently no we did wanna put
extra metadata and like timestamp

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:44.980
extra metadata and like timestamp
 

00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:46.980
extra metadata and like timestamp
information we're kind of on the fence

00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:46.990
information we're kind of on the fence
 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:48.930
information we're kind of on the fence
about the usefulness of that because

00:07:48.930 --> 00:07:48.940
about the usefulness of that because
 

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.550
about the usefulness of that because
when you do take a trace times are

00:07:50.550 --> 00:07:50.560
when you do take a trace times are
 

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.910
when you do take a trace times are
skewed so having sort of real time

00:07:53.910 --> 00:07:53.920
skewed so having sort of real time
 

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:55.680
skewed so having sort of real time
information can be a little bit

00:07:55.680 --> 00:07:55.690
information can be a little bit
 

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.440
information can be a little bit
deceptive but things like stack trace

00:07:58.440 --> 00:07:58.450
deceptive but things like stack trace
 

00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.930
deceptive but things like stack trace
information would be particularly useful

00:07:59.930 --> 00:07:59.940
information would be particularly useful
 

00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:02.130
information would be particularly useful
just seeing a particular draw call

00:08:02.130 --> 00:08:02.140
just seeing a particular draw call
 

00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:02.880
just seeing a particular draw call
that's bad

00:08:02.880 --> 00:08:02.890
that's bad
 

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:07.970
that's bad
where did that come from yeah so yes

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:07.980
where did that come from yeah so yes
 

00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:10.500
where did that come from yeah so yes
again if you have these suggestions

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:10.510
again if you have these suggestions
 

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:13.770
again if you have these suggestions
please forward them to us and we'll act

please forward them to us and we'll act
upon them does the framerate view show

00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:20.410
upon them does the framerate view show
 

00:08:20.410 --> 00:08:22.560
upon them does the framerate view show
the current render target that's bound

00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:22.570
the current render target that's bound
 

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:24.510
the current render target that's bound
or is it joing what's going to be the

00:08:24.510 --> 00:08:24.520
or is it joing what's going to be the
 

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.460
or is it joing what's going to be the
back cover that the frame buffer view

00:08:26.460 --> 00:08:26.470
back cover that the frame buffer view
 

00:08:26.470 --> 00:08:28.290
back cover that the frame buffer view
shows what is currently bound at that

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:28.300
shows what is currently bound at that
 

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.600
shows what is currently bound at that
point in the trace okay yeah yeah if you

00:08:30.600 --> 00:08:30.610
point in the trace okay yeah yeah if you
 

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:32.370
point in the trace okay yeah yeah if you
have post effects and things that are

00:08:32.370 --> 00:08:32.380
have post effects and things that are
 

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:40.939

00:12:52.519 --> 00:12:54.160
report so you don't have to have the
layers in you take a trace and you get

00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:54.170
layers in you take a trace and you get
 

00:12:54.170 --> 00:12:57.129
layers in you take a trace and you get
all the same information out and the

00:12:57.129 --> 00:12:57.139
all the same information out and the
 

00:12:57.139 --> 00:12:59.500
all the same information out and the
final one is an improved UI for

00:12:59.500 --> 00:12:59.510
final one is an improved UI for
 

00:12:59.510 --> 00:13:01.240
final one is an improved UI for

one way of doing it but it isn't the

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:15.170
one way of doing it but it isn't the
 

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.470
one way of doing it but it isn't the
best ways that we feel so we're doing a

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480
best ways that we feel so we're doing a
 

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.120
best ways that we feel so we're doing a
lot of research at the moment and how to

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:19.130
lot of research at the moment and how to
 

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:23.079
lot of research at the moment and how to
better visualize these new graphics API

better visualize these new graphics API
 

00:13:23.089 --> 00:13:26.530
better visualize these new graphics API
is but you have more of a graph

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:26.540
is but you have more of a graph

representation maybe so after that we

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:31.400
representation maybe so after that we
 

00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:35.290
representation maybe so after that we
have a large collection of ideas of

these slides are going to be going
 

00:14:06.830 --> 00:14:08.050
these slides are going to be going
through some of the things that we can

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:08.060
through some of the things that we can
 

00:14:08.060 --> 00:14:11.019
through some of the things that we can
do and how I categorize them in my crazy

00:14:11.019 --> 00:14:11.029
do and how I categorize them in my crazy

game you burn so there is a

00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:15.410
game you burn so there is a
 

00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:17.590
game you burn so there is a
questionnaire that you can fill in as

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:17.600
questionnaire that you can fill in as

we're going through this it might be

00:14:19.810 --> 00:14:19.820
we're going through this it might be
 

00:14:19.820 --> 00:14:23.199
we're going through this it might be
helpful to play along just so that you

00:14:23.199 --> 00:14:23.209
helpful to play along just so that you
 

00:14:23.209 --> 00:14:25.300
helpful to play along just so that you
know what I'm talking about when you

00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:25.310
know what I'm talking about when you
 

00:14:25.310 --> 00:14:28.060
know what I'm talking about when you
have a question if you don't want to

00:14:28.060 --> 00:14:28.070
have a question if you don't want to
 

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:30.310
have a question if you don't want to
that's fine I won't hold it against you

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320
that's fine I won't hold it against you
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:34.840
that's fine I won't hold it against you
but yeah if you can open that please go

00:14:34.840 --> 00:14:34.850
but yeah if you can open that please go
 

00:14:34.850 --> 00:14:37.630
but yeah if you can open that please go
ahead and the slides will relate to the

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:37.640
ahead and the slides will relate to the
 

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:44.220
ahead and the slides will relate to the
questions that come through

00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:44.230
 

00:14:44.230 --> 00:14:57.199
that's a question question

00:14:57.199 --> 00:14:57.209
 

00:14:57.209 --> 00:14:59.999
is there any timeline for a graphics

00:14:59.999 --> 00:15:00.009
is there any timeline for a graphics
 

00:15:00.009 --> 00:15:06.329
is there any timeline for a graphics
profiler for the GPU timeline we'll see

00:15:06.329 --> 00:15:06.339
profiler for the GPU timeline we'll see
 

00:15:06.339 --> 00:15:08.460
profiler for the GPU timeline we'll see
what the feedback is from today and we

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:08.470
what the feedback is from today and we
 

00:15:08.470 --> 00:15:10.170
what the feedback is from today and we
we might be able to gather a timeline

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:10.180
we might be able to gather a timeline
 

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:18.660
we might be able to gather a timeline
from them cool so the the first group

00:15:18.660 --> 00:15:18.670
from them cool so the the first group
 

00:15:18.670 --> 00:15:22.889
from them cool so the the first group
here is statistics I kind of classify

00:15:22.889 --> 00:15:22.899
here is statistics I kind of classify
 

00:15:22.899 --> 00:15:26.309
here is statistics I kind of classify
things that don't involve profiling but

00:15:26.309 --> 00:15:26.319
things that don't involve profiling but
 

00:15:26.319 --> 00:15:28.410
things that don't involve profiling but
still have meaningful values under this

00:15:28.410 --> 00:15:28.420
still have meaningful values under this
 

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.739
still have meaningful values under this
creep so the simplest one which we

00:15:31.739 --> 00:15:31.749
creep so the simplest one which we
 

00:15:31.749 --> 00:15:34.259
creep so the simplest one which we
probably should have by now is the sort

00:15:34.259 --> 00:15:34.269
probably should have by now is the sort
 

00:15:34.269 --> 00:15:36.929
probably should have by now is the sort
of Expo why stuff so this is number of

00:15:36.929 --> 00:15:36.939
of Expo why stuff so this is number of
 

00:15:36.939 --> 00:15:39.239
of Expo why stuff so this is number of
draw calls per frame is like the most

00:15:39.239 --> 00:15:39.249
draw calls per frame is like the most
 

00:15:39.249 --> 00:15:42.480
draw calls per frame is like the most
obvious one you're doing 2,000 draw

00:15:42.480 --> 00:15:42.490
obvious one you're doing 2,000 draw
 

00:15:42.490 --> 00:15:44.040
obvious one you're doing 2,000 draw
calls and a device that communicate with

00:15:44.040 --> 00:15:44.050
calls and a device that communicate with
 

00:15:44.050 --> 00:15:46.199
calls and a device that communicate with
a few hundred you're gonna have a bad

00:15:46.199 --> 00:15:46.209
a few hundred you're gonna have a bad
 

00:15:46.209 --> 00:15:46.549
a few hundred you're gonna have a bad
time

00:15:46.549 --> 00:15:46.559
time
 

00:15:46.559 --> 00:15:51.600
time
so yeah examples of this are obviously

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:51.610
so yeah examples of this are obviously
 

00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.530
so yeah examples of this are obviously
draws per frame vertices per draw

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:54.540
draws per frame vertices per draw
 

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:59.970
draws per frame vertices per draw
triangles per whatever estimates or

00:15:59.970 --> 00:15:59.980
triangles per whatever estimates or
 

00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:02.970
triangles per whatever estimates or
memory usage as well my you know number

00:16:02.970 --> 00:16:02.980
memory usage as well my you know number
 

00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:07.379
memory usage as well my you know number
of mix of textures that you have we also

00:16:07.379 --> 00:16:07.389
of mix of textures that you have we also
 

00:16:07.389 --> 00:16:10.319
of mix of textures that you have we also
want to come up with some sort of device

00:16:10.319 --> 00:16:10.329
want to come up with some sort of device
 

00:16:10.329 --> 00:16:12.540
want to come up with some sort of device
budgets part of my work over the last

year has been going out to games

00:16:14.059 --> 00:16:14.069
year has been going out to games
 

00:16:14.069 --> 00:16:16.350
year has been going out to games
companies and trying to help them get

00:16:16.350 --> 00:16:16.360
companies and trying to help them get
 

00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:21.540
companies and trying to help them get
their games reaching 60 and yeah sort of

00:16:21.540 --> 00:16:21.550
their games reaching 60 and yeah sort of
 

00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:24.600
their games reaching 60 and yeah sort of
based on the expo well I think the

00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:24.610
based on the expo well I think the
 

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:26.460
based on the expo well I think the
number of titles that are being

00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:26.470
number of titles that are being
 

00:16:26.470 --> 00:16:29.389
number of titles that are being
developed without any kind of reasonable

00:16:29.389 --> 00:16:29.399
developed without any kind of reasonable
 

00:16:29.399 --> 00:16:32.069
developed without any kind of reasonable
guidelines on how many draw calls you

00:16:32.069 --> 00:16:32.079
guidelines on how many draw calls you
 

00:16:32.079 --> 00:16:33.749
guidelines on how many draw calls you
should be making for a particular device

00:16:33.749 --> 00:16:33.759
should be making for a particular device
 

00:16:33.759 --> 00:16:38.069
should be making for a particular device
is a little bit depressing so we could

00:16:38.069 --> 00:16:38.079
is a little bit depressing so we could
 

00:16:38.079 --> 00:16:41.970
is a little bit depressing so we could
offer up some sort of data for a

00:16:41.970 --> 00:16:41.980
offer up some sort of data for a
 

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:44.280
offer up some sort of data for a
particular flagship device we recommend

00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:44.290
particular flagship device we recommend
 

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:47.340
particular flagship device we recommend
that you submit X number of vertices per

00:16:47.340 --> 00:16:47.350
that you submit X number of vertices per
 

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:51.329
that you submit X number of vertices per
frame for example we could have inside

00:16:51.329 --> 00:16:51.339
frame for example we could have inside
 

00:16:51.339 --> 00:16:55.139
frame for example we could have inside

visualizations these are things like

00:17:06.870 --> 00:17:06.880
visualizations these are things like
 

00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:08.699
visualizations these are things like
number of over drawers the

00:17:08.699 --> 00:17:08.709
number of over drawers the
 

00:17:08.709 --> 00:17:12.269
number of over drawers the
doing we can also include things in here

00:17:12.269 --> 00:17:12.279
doing we can also include things in here
 

00:17:12.279 --> 00:17:16.049
doing we can also include things in here
like the number highlighting the

00:17:16.049 --> 00:17:16.059
like the number highlighting the
 

00:17:16.059 --> 00:17:18.090
like the number highlighting the
fragments that may have failed a depth

00:17:18.090 --> 00:17:18.100
fragments that may have failed a depth
 

00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:20.659
fragments that may have failed a depth
test which would be a good thing or

00:17:20.659 --> 00:17:20.669
test which would be a good thing or
 

00:17:20.669 --> 00:17:24.809
test which would be a good thing or
displaying the frame by shader program

00:17:24.809 --> 00:17:24.819
displaying the frame by shader program
 

00:17:24.819 --> 00:17:26.250
displaying the frame by shader program
for example which is a great way of

00:17:26.250 --> 00:17:26.260
for example which is a great way of
 

00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:28.470
for example which is a great way of
knowing where you should be looking at

00:17:28.470 --> 00:17:28.480
knowing where you should be looking at
 

00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:33.360
knowing where you should be looking at
optimizing your shaders shader static

00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:33.370
optimizing your shaders shader static
 

00:17:33.370 --> 00:17:37.760

it's coming okay shader static analysis
so this is a tricky one it would have to

00:17:51.269 --> 00:17:51.279
so this is a tricky one it would have to
 

00:17:51.279 --> 00:17:52.560
so this is a tricky one it would have to
be a sort of finger in the air one

what the shader is doing the hardware is
 

00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:04.080
what the shader is doing the hardware is
doing but yeah we can come up with some

is frame and draw counters I've said but
 

00:18:28.539 --> 00:18:32.360
is frame and draw counters I've said but
yeah frame and your time would be great

00:18:32.360 --> 00:18:32.370

00:26:18.299 --> 00:26:21.950
was a lot of stuff that I just covered
very very quickly if there are things

00:26:21.950 --> 00:26:21.960
very very quickly if there are things
 

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.080
very very quickly if there are things
that I've missed here and you think are

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:24.090
that I've missed here and you think are
 

00:26:24.090 --> 00:26:26.720
that I've missed here and you think are
very valuable please please please let

00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:26.730
very valuable please please please let
 

00:26:26.730 --> 00:26:34.030
very valuable please please please let
us know and that's it any questions

00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:34.040
 

00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:41.180
sorry Mike Fincke you just mentioned

00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:41.190
sorry Mike Fincke you just mentioned
 

00:26:41.190 --> 00:26:46.190
sorry Mike Fincke you just mentioned
power profiling could you liberate it's

00:26:46.190 --> 00:26:46.200
power profiling could you liberate it's
 

00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:48.490
power profiling could you liberate it's
still very much research at the moment

00:26:48.490 --> 00:26:48.500
still very much research at the moment
 

00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.310
still very much research at the moment
but the idea is that we could have the

00:26:52.310 --> 00:26:52.320
but the idea is that we could have the
 

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:54.320
but the idea is that we could have the
ability to replay the same frame

00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:54.330
ability to replay the same frame
 

00:26:54.330 --> 00:26:57.530
ability to replay the same frame
repeatedly and if we had hardware

00:26:57.530 --> 00:26:57.540
repeatedly and if we had hardware
 

00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.210
repeatedly and if we had hardware
support for actually seeing the drain

00:26:59.210 --> 00:26:59.220
support for actually seeing the drain
 

00:26:59.220 --> 00:27:02.210
support for actually seeing the drain
and monitoring the thermals we can at

00:27:02.210 --> 00:27:02.220
and monitoring the thermals we can at
 

00:27:02.220 --> 00:27:04.610
and monitoring the thermals we can at
least come up with a if you keep on

00:27:04.610 --> 00:27:04.620
least come up with a if you keep on
 

00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:06.049
least come up with a if you keep on
having your game render something

00:27:06.049 --> 00:27:06.059
having your game render something
 

00:27:06.059 --> 00:27:08.480
having your game render something
similar to this particular frame this is

00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:08.490
similar to this particular frame this is
 

00:27:08.490 --> 00:27:09.980
similar to this particular frame this is
the kind of characteristics you're going

00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:09.990
the kind of characteristics you're going
 

00:27:09.990 --> 00:27:15.169
the kind of characteristics you're going
to have on the battery in firms and any

00:27:15.169 --> 00:27:15.179
to have on the battery in firms and any
 

00:27:15.179 --> 00:27:16.700
to have on the battery in firms and any
of the heuristics that we have for

00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:16.710
of the heuristics that we have for
 

00:27:16.710 --> 00:27:18.680
of the heuristics that we have for
optimization we can also try that as

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:18.690
optimization we can also try that as
 

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:20.360
optimization we can also try that as
well it might be something that you

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:20.370
well it might be something that you
 

00:27:20.370 --> 00:27:21.980
well it might be something that you
would have to run overnight to try and

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:21.990
would have to run overnight to try and
 

00:27:21.990 --> 00:27:24.830
would have to run overnight to try and
get stable results but it's better than

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:24.840
get stable results but it's better than
 

00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:27.140
get stable results but it's better than
weeks and weeks of poking around

00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:27.150
weeks and weeks of poking around
 

00:27:27.150 --> 00:27:34.130
weeks and weeks of poking around
yourself

00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:34.140
 

00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:36.330
you put your all back up the question

00:27:36.330 --> 00:27:36.340
you put your all back up the question
 

00:27:36.340 --> 00:27:46.110
you put your all back up the question
here oh sure

00:27:46.110 --> 00:27:46.120
 

00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:55.310
finger hearts Marriott

00:27:55.310 --> 00:27:55.320
 

00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.480
there's Laura kisana where's

00:27:58.480 --> 00:27:58.490
there's Laura kisana where's
 

00:27:58.490 --> 00:28:05.730
there's Laura kisana where's
here

00:28:05.730 --> 00:28:05.740
 

00:28:05.740 --> 00:28:07.860
firth of power and thermals is there

00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:07.870
firth of power and thermals is there
 

00:28:07.870 --> 00:28:10.049
firth of power and thermals is there
gonna be any way to tie that back to the

00:28:10.049 --> 00:28:10.059
gonna be any way to tie that back to the
 

00:28:10.059 --> 00:28:12.779
gonna be any way to tie that back to the
core frequencies and the CPU usage so

00:28:12.779 --> 00:28:12.789
core frequencies and the CPU usage so
 

00:28:12.789 --> 00:28:14.700
core frequencies and the CPU usage so
you can see whether or not there's a

00:28:14.700 --> 00:28:14.710
you can see whether or not there's a
 

00:28:14.710 --> 00:28:17.490
you can see whether or not there's a
trade-off between your submission of the

00:28:17.490 --> 00:28:17.500
trade-off between your submission of the
 

00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:20.399
trade-off between your submission of the
call time versus the actual GPU time

00:28:20.399 --> 00:28:20.409
call time versus the actual GPU time
 

00:28:20.409 --> 00:28:22.980
call time versus the actual GPU time
great suggestion

00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:22.990
great suggestion
 

00:28:22.990 --> 00:28:28.799
great suggestion
yeah maybe these are things that we have

00:28:28.799 --> 00:28:28.809
yeah maybe these are things that we have
 

00:28:28.809 --> 00:28:30.930
yeah maybe these are things that we have
briefly looked at we haven't started

00:28:30.930 --> 00:28:30.940
briefly looked at we haven't started
 

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:33.000
briefly looked at we haven't started
development on so yeah if that's

00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:33.010
development on so yeah if that's
 

00:28:33.010 --> 00:28:37.350
development on so yeah if that's
valuable okay
