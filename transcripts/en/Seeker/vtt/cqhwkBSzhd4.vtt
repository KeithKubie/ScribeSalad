00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.629
Ever wonder why after deciding to buy a certain
type of car you see that make and model everywhere

00:00:04.629 --> 00:00:08.310
on the road? Or why you’re suddenly noticing
advertisements for that new video game your

00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.350
friend got and you’re dying to play?

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:12.559
Well pay attention. This, is DNews

00:00:12.559 --> 00:00:21.310
Hey Guys, Crystal Dilworth here for DNews!

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:25.590
As objective and perceptive as we’d like
to think we are, our inner thoughts and desires

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:30.620
are influencing what we notice about our environment
everyday. This is partially due to a phenomenon

00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:33.579
we all fall victim to: Attention Bias

00:00:33.579 --> 00:00:38.280
Attention Bias is the tendency of our perception
to be influenced by our recurring thoughts

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:42.351
and it is why when you are waiting for your
paycheck so you can buy the new iPhone, you

00:00:42.351 --> 00:00:48.499
see people with that phone everywhere … showing
off … taunting you with their very existence

00:00:48.499 --> 00:00:50.489
… *shakes it off*

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:55.261
This special attention is especially noticeable
in drug seeking behavior. In fact, Attention

00:00:55.261 --> 00:00:58.149
Bias is thought to be an underlying issue
of addiction.

00:00:58.149 --> 00:01:02.469
Scientists found that smokers spend a longer
time looking at smoking related cues like

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:06.910
pictures of people smoking, cigarette lighters,
or cigarettes, than they do on neutral cues

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.790
like people eating, or other non-smoking related
objects and those same researchers, found

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:17.460
more brain activation in the insular cortex,
the orbitofrontal cortex and the amygdala

00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:21.480
when smokers were presented with the images
of smoking. Those are all regions of the brain

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:25.760
involved in emotion, and decision making.
(hypothesizing) So maybe the longer fixation

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:28.480
on the image is due to increased brain activation?

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:32.950
It’s not just addicts that display this
behavior. Recently, a study in the Journal

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:37.890
of Pain Research reported that individuals
with chronic pain are more sensitive to words

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:39.820
that describe painful sensations.

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:43.500
While both study groups, those who reported
experiencing chronic pain, and the control

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.510
group of individuals without chronic pain,
spent a longer time looking at pain related

00:01:47.510 --> 00:01:52.270
words than neutral words, the chronic pain
group spent even more time fixated on those

00:01:52.270 --> 00:01:56.690
words and returned their attention to the
pain related words more frequently.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:00.180
Researchers are hoping that these data will
help them understand the underlying basis

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:04.940
of chronic pain. So pay attention to what
you pay attention to, because it may be influencing

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.070
your reality more than you think ;)
