00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:24.370
&gt;&gt; Sue Vita: Good
evening everyone.

00:00:24.370 --> 00:00:26.290
I'm Sue Vita, the chief
of the music division here

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:27.590
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.330
And I am really so
pleased to welcome you all

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:34.950
to the Montpelier Room
for another installment

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:38.870
in the Library of Congress
American Musicological Society

00:00:38.870 --> 00:00:40.710
lecture series.

00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:46.030
Maybe I need to pull this
down a little further.

00:00:46.030 --> 00:00:49.460
This is meant to share
the meaningful scholarship

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.560
that members of the
society have conducted

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.390
in the music division's
vast collections.

00:00:56.390 --> 00:01:04.800
I remember sitting at the
conference in 2007, I think,

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.450
and talking about
starting this series.

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.540
And wondering whether
it would be something

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.680
which could succeed
and could endure.

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:22.200
And so delighted to see
how well we have done.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.040
And what good scholarship
we have been able

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.300
to highlight throughout
the series.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.880
We inaugurated the series with
a presentation from Judith Tick

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.770
about her research on
Ruth Crawford Seeger.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:43.830
And since then AMS members
have come to the library

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:48.210
to present research on a
diverse array of topics

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.130
from Schoenberg to "Show Boat."

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:56.240
Tonight we will learn more
about uncovering Jewish activism

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.080
within our sheet
music collections.

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.760
Specifically in the
Irene Heskes collection

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.030
of Yiddish American
popular songs.

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:08.160
Tonight's lecture is
being recorded for webcast

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.750
and will be made available on
the Library of Congress website

00:02:11.750 --> 00:02:14.120
and You Tube channel along

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.790
with the nearly 20
lectures presented thus far

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.200
in the series.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.050
It is our hope, aside

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.820
from celebrating
musicological research

00:02:23.820 --> 00:02:26.180
in the music divisions
collection,

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:30.520
that the series inspires other
scholars to take advantage

00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:33.870
of the Library of Congress
and our music collections,

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:37.990
both online and in
the reading room.

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:43.820
I am now pleased to introduce
Dr. Ronit Seter, who specializes

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.370
in contemporary music
and Israeli music.

00:02:46.370 --> 00:02:49.530
And has served on the faculties

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:53.270
of the Peabody Conservatory
at Johns Hopkins.

00:02:53.270 --> 00:02:55.440
George Washington University.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.130
Hebrew university of Jerusalem.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:01.920
And American University
in Washington DC.

00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:05.410
She is also affiliated with the
Jewish Music Research Centre,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.090
Hebrew University of Jerusalem.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.200
Let's welcome to the
microphone Dr. Seter,

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.340
who will offer greetings

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.080
from the American
Musicological Society

00:03:17.080 --> 00:03:20.510
and introduce tonight's
guest lecturer, Dr. Seter.

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:29.680
[ Applause ]

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:30.980
&gt;&gt; Ronit Seter: Thank you, Sue.

00:03:30.980 --> 00:03:33.340
I would like to welcome you

00:03:33.340 --> 00:03:38.460
to our actually celebratory 20th
lecture of the lecture series

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:42.400
of the American Musicological
Society in collaboration

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.080
with the music division of
the Library of Congress.

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.630
This lecture completes
actually ten years

00:03:49.630 --> 00:03:52.400
of these fruitful collaboration

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.980
of two distinguished
lecture [inaudible].

00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:59.790
All available as webcast if
you just search AMSLC lectures.

00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:04.810
As Sue said, we begin
here in 2008.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:08.200
And it was in the
Coolidge Auditorium

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.390
with Sue introducing Judith
Tick and Ruth Crawford.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.670
These lectures are
presented by musicologists

00:04:15.670 --> 00:04:19.090
to help conduct research
here or virtually here,

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:22.560
now you can do it all
virtually online, the archives

00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.720
of the music division
that Sue heads.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:28.910
These presentations
are obviously

00:04:28.910 --> 00:04:32.470
and generally supported
by the help

00:04:32.470 --> 00:04:35.750
of the music division's
excellent librarians.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:37.770
So we are all indebted to you.

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:41.250
Thank you.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:44.800
I had the honor to give two
presentations actually here

00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:46.110
at the Library of Congress.

00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:48.360
Not part of this series though.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:51.900
They were invited by the Hebraic
section and were delivered

00:04:51.900 --> 00:04:54.900
in the African and Middle
Eastern Reading Room.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.060
But they were certainly
centered on the field

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:01.010
of Jewish studies in music.

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:05.130
And as a co-founder with Klara
Moricz of the AMS study group

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:09.270
on Jewish studies and music in
2010, I'm especially honored

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.710
to be requested on behalf

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:15.880
of the American Musicological
Society to welcome you.

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.030
And to introduce
you, to introduce

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:24.520
to you tonight our speaker,
Professor Randall Goldberg.

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:28.750
Goldberg is associate professor
of musicology and director

00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:30.860
of the Dana School of Music

00:05:30.860 --> 00:05:35.060
at Youngstown State
University in Ohio.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:41.630
He's a contributor to the
CPE Bach, The Complete Works,

00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:47.580
focusing on Carl Philip Emanuel
Bach, Saint Luke passions.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.940
And also to the Oxford
Dictionary of the Middle Ages.

00:05:51.940 --> 00:05:56.000
He [inaudible] dissertation
at Indiana University,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.730
looked at the Zarlino-Galileo
dispute.

00:05:59.730 --> 00:06:04.900
Beyond early and baroque
music, he just revealed,

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.990
just to reveal a bit of
his encyclopedic knowledge,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.160
Professor Goldberg primary
instrument is guitar.

00:06:13.160 --> 00:06:18.360
And he directs the early music
ensemble in his institution.

00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:23.920
He taught choruses on various
topics like rock and roll.

00:06:23.920 --> 00:06:26.980
German opera of the
19th century.

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:28.280
American song.

00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.580
Gustav Meyer.

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:31.500
And musical borrowings.

00:06:31.500 --> 00:06:36.480
However, his current research
in the last few years focuses

00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:40.410
on the music of Jewish
immigrants in America.

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.470
Goldberg is also doing a lot of
work as a public musicologist.

00:06:45.470 --> 00:06:49.090
He was the past president
of the Allegheny Chapter

00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.480
of the American Musicological
Society.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:57.530
And currently he's serving as
the executive committee board

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:03.430
of directors of the Youngstown
Jewish Community Center.

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:07.540
Goldberg has presented
on this topic at public

00:07:07.540 --> 00:07:10.480
and academic forums,
including the conference

00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:12.880
on Jewish music,
Jewish identity.

00:07:12.880 --> 00:07:15.650
Which he actually
organized and hosted

00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:19.980
in Youngstown University
in 2014.

00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.920
The conference presented
some of the leading scholars

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:25.660
in the field of Jewish studies

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.500
in music whose work Goldberg
edited in a special volume

00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.530
of the "Journal of Music
Identities" earlier this year.

00:07:37.530 --> 00:07:39.230
Just published.

00:07:39.230 --> 00:07:44.710
Goldberg also publishes in
"Musica Judaica and Notes."

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:49.890
And he's a very proud father of
two kids that are here today.

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:53.920
His presentation today is
titled "The Kishineff Massacre

00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:56.910
and Domestic Musical
Practice in America."

00:07:56.910 --> 00:08:00.750
It unfolds the broad context

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.860
of Herman Shapiro's
1904 solo piece piano

00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.550
by the same name,
"Kishineff Massacre."

00:08:08.550 --> 00:08:12.730
It is a descriptive
composition written just a year

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:15.990
after the first Kishineff
Pogrom.

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:18.030
And Goldberg chose to invite

00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:23.450
to this presentation the
musicologist Jonathan Yaeger,

00:08:23.450 --> 00:08:31.180
who is also a pianist organist
and on the music history faculty

00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:35.680
at Juilliard, who
focuses on music politics

00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:38.830
and the culture of
post-war Germany.

00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:41.720
I'm certainly looking
forward to the opportunity

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:47.060
to hear the musical examples
live with pianist Yaeger.

00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:50.440
Goldberg presented
earlier version

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:54.410
of these Kishineff Massacre
presentation not only

00:08:54.410 --> 00:08:57.970
in his own 2014 Youngstown
Conference

00:08:57.970 --> 00:09:01.450
on Jewish Music and
Jewish Identity.

00:09:01.450 --> 00:09:06.660
But also at the AMS national
meeting in Louisville, 2015.

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:10.390
And in SUNY Fredonia in 2016.

00:09:10.390 --> 00:09:14.280
I'm looking forward very
much to hear this version,

00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:17.770
which will be available
for all of us as a webcast

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:23.080
at the AMS Library of
Congress lecture series.

00:09:23.080 --> 00:09:27.510
Please join me in welcoming
professor Randall Goldberg.

00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:37.270
[ Applause ]

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:38.570
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
Good evening

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:39.870
and thank you all for coming.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.830
And thank you, Ronit,
for that introduction.

00:09:41.830 --> 00:09:44.490
I'm grateful to have
this opportunity

00:09:44.490 --> 00:09:47.320
to present my research
in this forum

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.030
and share this unique
piece of history.

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:53.300
I especially want to acknowledge
Bob Judd Executive Director

00:09:53.300 --> 00:09:54.630
of the AMS.

00:09:54.630 --> 00:09:57.770
And Kate Miller and David Plylar
of the Library of Congress

00:09:57.770 --> 00:10:01.180
who have been so helpful in
setting up my accommodations.

00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:02.480
My logistics.

00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:03.780
Spreading word about the event.

00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.160
So thanks very much.

00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:07.120
I also want to thank my
dear friend Jonathan Yaeger

00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:10.150
for being here and playing
piano for this presentation.

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:13.430
I'll begin by telling you a
little bit about how I got

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.690
into this research project.

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:18.880
About a year after I
completed my Ph.D. dissertation

00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.970
on Italian Renaissance music
theory, I just happened

00:10:21.970 --> 00:10:23.480
to be minding my own business

00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.340
at the Youngstown
Jewish Community Center.

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:28.930
When the executive director of
the center approached me to see

00:10:28.930 --> 00:10:32.710
if I was interested in taking
home the JCC's collection

00:10:32.710 --> 00:10:35.880
of dusty 78 RPM records.

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.130
He was just looking for a
chump who could help them clean

00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.040
out some closet space.

00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:43.410
But I'm kind of a sucker for
free records and free CDs

00:10:43.410 --> 00:10:44.850
and other media like that.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.190
So I took the bait.

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.380
The collection contains
many sacred recordings

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.200
by star cantors.

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.650
Novelty songs.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:54.240
Comedy skits.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:56.580
There're even some records
that have Yiddish songs

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:01.740
and Latin dance craze
tunes on the other side.

00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:04.770
So what I did was I started
looking at the records and ended

00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:06.660
up making a little
database of them.

00:11:06.660 --> 00:11:09.490
And I thought this is
interesting, but, you know,

00:11:09.490 --> 00:11:10.960
what would happen if I
looked at more records?

00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:14.440
And I ended up creating a
database of about 6,000 records,

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:18.570
which I did from
using online catalogs

00:11:18.570 --> 00:11:21.540
and printed discographies.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:23.230
And basically getting
information,

00:11:23.230 --> 00:11:25.870
reputable information from
wherever I could find it.

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:28.300
I also spent some
time at the YIVO,

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:31.000
which is the Yiddish
Institute in New York City.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.160
And also at, residency at
the Judaica Sound Archives

00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.320
in Florida Atlantic University.

00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:39.190
In that initial collection
the disc

00:11:39.190 --> 00:11:41.930
that interested me
most was a recording

00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:46.370
of a descriptive overture
called the "Kishineff Pogrom."

00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:48.650
And I had two questions
for this record.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:52.230
First of all, why would
Jews want to listen to it?

00:11:52.230 --> 00:11:54.180
And, you know, why would
anyone want to listen

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.890
to a musical depiction
of a recent atrocity?

00:11:56.890 --> 00:11:58.480
What's the point?

00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.460
Wasn't living it enough?

00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:03.310
So that was my first question.

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:05.950
And the second question was,
you know, what are the sounds

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:07.970
on these records
supposed to represent?

00:12:07.970 --> 00:12:09.330
If this describes a pogrom,

00:12:09.330 --> 00:12:13.070
how do I connect the
notes to what a pogrom is?

00:12:13.070 --> 00:12:16.260
So investigating these things,

00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:18.410
I found that there's actually
a fascinating history here.

00:12:18.410 --> 00:12:21.370
And I put it all
together with mostly

00:12:21.370 --> 00:12:24.590
by studying sheet music
that's in the Irene Heskes

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:27.090
and other collections in
the Library of Congress.

00:12:27.090 --> 00:12:28.630
So another reason
why I'm very glad

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.940
to present this research here.

00:12:29.940 --> 00:12:34.840
In case you're not familiar with
the Kishineff Pogrom, Kishineff

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.600
or Chisinau is the
current capital of Moldova.

00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:41.260
And at the time of
the pogrom in 1904,

00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:44.570
Jews made up about 30
percent of the population.

00:12:44.570 --> 00:12:48.090
In the years leading up to
the pogrom, the "Bessarabetz,"

00:12:48.090 --> 00:12:49.800
a local newspaper edited

00:12:49.800 --> 00:12:53.240
by the rabid anti-Semite
Pavolaki Krushevan,

00:12:53.240 --> 00:12:56.480
printed a number of articles
against the Jewish community.

00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:59.180
In 1903 he found
the perfect catalyst

00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:01.860
to set off the violence
that was to come.

00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:04.650
Two Christian children had
been found dead in the area

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.050
around Kishineff and
Krushevan claimed

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:10.050
that Jews had murdered the
children and drained their blood

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.610
to make matzo for Passover.

00:13:11.610 --> 00:13:15.680
And this is a classic kind
of lie told about Jews

00:13:15.680 --> 00:13:18.740
when people need to justify
violence against them.

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:21.450
And in case you're not
familiar with Jewish practice,

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:23.340
Jews have never used
blood to cook.

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:27.190
It's not kosher, so it's just
not something we would do.

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:30.050
Nevertheless, on Easter
Sunday of that year,

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:33.470
mobs headed into the
Jewish areas of the city.

00:13:33.470 --> 00:13:35.840
And they murdered many
people, and then they raped

00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:38.330
and pillaged for several days.

00:13:38.330 --> 00:13:40.740
It was this atrocity
that inspired the music

00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:43.150
that I'm now going to discuss.

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:50.240
The Kishineff Pogrom of 1903 is
one of many events memorialized

00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:52.950
in Judaism's tragic past.

00:13:52.950 --> 00:13:55.130
Although the number of
casualties does not compare

00:13:55.130 --> 00:13:58.460
with the Holocaust or
even many other pogroms,

00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:01.850
the massacre had a great
influence on Jewish activism,

00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.120
even for those who will
already immigrated to America.

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:08.380
Indeed, in a 2013
lecture on Kishineff

00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.190
at the YIVO Institution
for Jewish Research,

00:14:11.190 --> 00:14:14.480
historian Steven Zipperstein
claimed that the fallout

00:14:14.480 --> 00:14:18.100
of the pogrom inspired
Jewish-American involvement

00:14:18.100 --> 00:14:22.840
in not only the creation
of the NAACP and the ACLU,

00:14:22.840 --> 00:14:26.070
but also the election of
President Barack Obama.

00:14:26.070 --> 00:14:30.220
Furthermore, Zipperstein argues
that the extraordinary response

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:33.070
to Kishineff, which
played heavily in American

00:14:33.070 --> 00:14:35.310
and Yiddish-American newspapers,

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:38.150
was fuelled by an
important Zionist leader

00:14:38.150 --> 00:14:41.240
who coincidentally
resided in Kishineff.

00:14:41.240 --> 00:14:45.400
Indeed, Yakov Bernstein-Kogan
directed a Zionist post office

00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.260
out of Kishineff, which he used

00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.540
to communicate activities
throughout Russia and beyond.

00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.370
In the immediate
aftermath of the pogrom,

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:56.700
he energized his network of
international connections

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:59.890
to disseminate information
about the violence.

00:14:59.890 --> 00:15:01.810
Descriptions and
eyewitness accounts

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:05.080
in the press were accompanied
by benefit concerts.

00:15:05.080 --> 00:15:06.860
Poetry. Books.

00:15:06.860 --> 00:15:08.520
And new music.

00:15:08.520 --> 00:15:10.190
The speed at which new artifacts

00:15:10.190 --> 00:15:12.810
about the pogrom
appeared is remarkable.

00:15:12.810 --> 00:15:16.820
In fact, the "New York Times
Tribune" reported in 1903

00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:19.930
that one Yiddish theater
staged a dramatic reenactment

00:15:19.930 --> 00:15:24.220
of the massacre within 48
hours after it occurred.

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:26.380
Producers of the
reenactment did not strive

00:15:26.380 --> 00:15:29.060
for a literal presentation
of the events.

00:15:29.060 --> 00:15:32.440
Instead, basing the action
on previous atrocities.

00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:34.880
Their underlying messages
about the need for Jews

00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.180
to find a homeland, however,
were already familiar

00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:39.960
and superceded specific details.

00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.600
I want to briefly show some of
the newspapers from which I've,

00:15:45.600 --> 00:15:48.460
getting all this information
about all the press releases.

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:51.400
And these are documents
that you can, anyone can go

00:15:51.400 --> 00:15:54.120
to the Library of
Congress website.

00:15:54.120 --> 00:15:56.850
And you can actually search
for individual words like

00:15:56.850 --> 00:15:58.150
"Kishineff," and it will bring

00:15:58.150 --> 00:16:00.030
up where Kishineff
occurs in any paper.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.950
So it's just an amazing tool,

00:16:01.950 --> 00:16:03.250
and you can learn
so much from this.

00:16:03.250 --> 00:16:06.780
Here's a page from the "New
York Daily Tribune," 1903.

00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:10.320
And we can see the
top of this column,

00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.740
a letter from Kishineff
about the events.

00:16:12.740 --> 00:16:17.390
Later down here is an article
about the Russian ambassador

00:16:17.390 --> 00:16:20.750
to America who's complaining
that the news is all exaggerated

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:23.650
and it didn't really happen.

00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.430
Here's another page from
the "St. Louis Republic."

00:16:26.430 --> 00:16:30.340
And we see there's an
article about a father,

00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.100
a family in St. Louis
whose father escaped

00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:35.460
and how they're trying
to bring the family

00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.500
to America from Kishineff.

00:16:37.500 --> 00:16:40.280
There's an article about
Israel Zangwill's statements

00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:41.580
about the pogrom.

00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:43.240
Zangwill was a very
famous playwright

00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.640
who coined the term
"melting pot."

00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:46.990
So he's an important
figure in American letters.

00:16:46.990 --> 00:16:49.470
There's just, there's no
end to what you can get

00:16:49.470 --> 00:16:50.790
from just doing, you know,

00:16:50.790 --> 00:16:54.240
basic archival work
in these newspapers.

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.590
Much of the media
coverage strove

00:16:58.590 --> 00:17:01.780
to promote a Zionist
agenda as well

00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:03.820
as raise funds for the victims.

00:17:03.820 --> 00:17:06.930
For example, an article in
the "Brooklyn Daily Eagle,"

00:17:06.930 --> 00:17:09.550
seen here, begins
with the question,

00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:11.720
What is the lesson of Kishineff?

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:15.720
And responds, Ringing around
the world, loud and clear,

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:19.650
voiced by the great leaders
of Zion comes the answer.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.330
Return to Palestine.

00:17:21.330 --> 00:17:22.630
Rebuild the temple.

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:24.870
Resurrect the nation.

00:17:24.870 --> 00:17:27.580
Furthermore, new
books on anti-Semitism

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.620
in Russia also urged a
solution to the Jewish problem.

00:17:31.620 --> 00:17:35.550
The Irish activist and statesman
Michael Davitt visited Russia

00:17:35.550 --> 00:17:36.970
immediately after the pogrom.

00:17:36.970 --> 00:17:38.420
And wrote articles about it

00:17:38.420 --> 00:17:41.280
for William Randolph
Hearst's newspapers.

00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:42.950
His reporting served
as the basis

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:44.880
for the book "Within the Pale."

00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:48.160
The true story of anti-Semitic
persecution in Russia,

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:51.080
which he published
later in 1903.

00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.700
Although Davitt claimed to be in
line with the spirit and program

00:17:54.700 --> 00:17:59.300
of anti-Semitism, in some cases
he argues that he wrote the book

00:17:59.300 --> 00:18:02.970
to put forward a plea for the
objects of the Zionist movement.

00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.460
In addition to book-length
discussions and reactions

00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:16.170
in the newspapers, gruesome
poems like Shimen Frug's

00:18:16.170 --> 00:18:20.070
"Hot Rachmunes" or "Have
Mercy" were disseminated widely

00:18:20.070 --> 00:18:22.500
to inspire sympathy
in fellow Jews

00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:25.110
and raise funds for survivors.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:28.230
There were also musical works
published in the aftermath.

00:18:28.230 --> 00:18:30.510
And the Library of
Congress' collection includes

00:18:30.510 --> 00:18:31.810
many examples.

00:18:31.810 --> 00:18:35.670
I have just a couple here of
many that you can look at online

00:18:35.670 --> 00:18:37.580
or I guess see in the library.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.260
The first, "Hot Rachmunes,"
is a setting of the poem.

00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.680
Someone took Shimen Frug's
poem and set it as a song.

00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.810
The second, "The farewell
of the Jews to Kishineff,"

00:18:47.810 --> 00:18:50.590
is a descriptive piece
like the work I'm going

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.690
to speak in detail about.

00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:57.720
And also written as a response
to the pogrom and ways of,

00:18:57.720 --> 00:19:01.880
get people involved with the
issues of Jews in Europe.

00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:03.180
So there are many
other examples.

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.580
I just chose a couple.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:11.080
Shimen Frug's poem also
inspired Herman Shapiro's 1904

00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.370
"Kishineff Massacre," a
descriptive work for solo piano.

00:19:15.370 --> 00:19:18.660
Featuring a series of
short musical tableau,

00:19:18.660 --> 00:19:21.900
Shapiro designed his composition
to bring the severity

00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.220
of the pogrom into the living
rooms of American Jews.

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:28.370
And we can assume
to move their hearts

00:19:28.370 --> 00:19:30.790
to joining the Zionist cause.

00:19:30.790 --> 00:19:33.500
Shapiro's affective
score, with its ties

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:37.230
to Western European musical
traditions and foregrounding

00:19:37.230 --> 00:19:41.680
of what we might call
stereotypically Jewish elements,

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:44.390
stands out as a useful
point of departure

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:48.450
to discuss how composers
marketed Jewish catastrophe.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.940
Educated listeners and
performers on the plight

00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:52.240
of their brethren in Europe.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:55.140
And pressed for Zionist action.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.030
Shapiro's massacre can also help
us decode other musical media

00:19:59.030 --> 00:20:02.600
about Kishineff whose
aesthetic logic is not as clear.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.960
Such as the record which
I will discuss later.

00:20:07.290 --> 00:20:10.770
Herman Shapiro appears to
have been quite successful

00:20:10.770 --> 00:20:13.690
in marketing tragedy
to Jewish audiences.

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:15.540
The printed preface
to the score of his

00:20:15.540 --> 00:20:18.460
"Dr. Herzl Elegy"
includes a testimonial

00:20:18.460 --> 00:20:20.990
from a concert he gave in 1899.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:23.830
And it reads, "There
was given recently

00:20:23.830 --> 00:20:26.680
in Louisville a genuine
Hebrew concert.

00:20:26.680 --> 00:20:29.470
The program was distinctly
Jewish in character.

00:20:29.470 --> 00:20:31.570
The whole tragedy of
Israel found utterance

00:20:31.570 --> 00:20:33.330
in the eloquence of the music.

00:20:33.330 --> 00:20:35.700
Every feast of gladness
and every day of sorrow

00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.580
and oppression had
its record in melody."

00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:42.770
The same review claims that
everybody present who heard the

00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.830
"plaintive cry of his
own people" responded

00:20:46.830 --> 00:20:49.200
sympathetically to the music.

00:20:49.200 --> 00:20:52.580
It seems that Shapiro and his
live performances received the

00:20:52.580 --> 00:20:55.560
same reaction from audiences
that he hoped would occur

00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:57.970
in the living rooms
and salons of the Jews

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:01.390
who would purchase his
"Kishineff Massacre."

00:21:01.390 --> 00:21:05.770
The printed score, published
by Asna Goldberg in 1904,

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.160
is a striking as the
music it contains.

00:21:08.160 --> 00:21:11.670
The bright red cover, attention
grabbing in its own right,

00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:14.670
frames a ghastly
illustration of the pogrom.

00:21:14.670 --> 00:21:17.830
In the foreground angry
Russians whip an elderly man

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:21.660
and strangle a young woman while
a naked toddler inexplicably

00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.370
flies through the air.

00:21:23.370 --> 00:21:26.290
A silhouetted mob in
smoke fill the background,

00:21:26.290 --> 00:21:29.370
which is outlined by a
whip and a bloody sword.

00:21:29.370 --> 00:21:32.900
The macabre image is more than
suitable to attract Jews looking

00:21:32.900 --> 00:21:35.910
to contemplate or
memorialize suffering.

00:21:35.910 --> 00:21:38.930
And the Yiddish titles betray
the marketing intentions

00:21:38.930 --> 00:21:42.220
of the publisher.

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:45.700
Inside the cover we
find a Yiddish text

00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.410
in the English translation

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:50.460
of Shimen Frug's
poem "Hot Rachmunes."

00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:53.910
It's inclusion in the score
and connections to the music,

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:57.420
which I will discuss below,
help us understand the function

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:59.400
of Shapiro's piece as a tool

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:02.760
for domestic entertainment
and edification.

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:06.500
The Kishineff pogrom
may be a novel subject

00:22:06.500 --> 00:22:09.160
for a solo piano work,
but the structure

00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:12.380
of Shapiro's composition
follows the formula common

00:22:12.380 --> 00:22:14.590
to instrumental battle pieces.

00:22:14.590 --> 00:22:16.300
Which were popular
in America during

00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.810
and just after the Civil War.

00:22:17.810 --> 00:22:20.490
A full history of
musical depictions

00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.940
of battles would take
us back centuries

00:22:22.940 --> 00:22:26.000
in the Western European
canon and include clever

00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:28.650
and entertaining works
by Clement Janequin.

00:22:28.650 --> 00:22:29.950
William Byrd.

00:22:29.950 --> 00:22:31.250
Heinrich Biber.

00:22:31.250 --> 00:22:33.880
And even Beethoven's much
criticized battle symphony

00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:36.170
titled "Wellington's Victory."

00:22:36.170 --> 00:22:38.740
According to Richard Crawford
in "America's Musical Life,"

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:43.030
however, most American composers
modeled their battle pieces

00:22:43.030 --> 00:22:46.710
on the Bohemian Frantisek
Kocvara's "Battle of Prague,"

00:22:46.710 --> 00:22:49.950
which was first published
in the 1780s.

00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:53.110
Kocvara's setting depicts
Frederick the Great's victory

00:22:53.110 --> 00:22:55.990
over the Austrians during
the Seven Years' War

00:22:55.990 --> 00:22:58.770
through a series of
short musical episodes.

00:22:58.770 --> 00:23:01.570
He writes in common
western musical topics

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:04.520
such as march rhythms,
horn calls and Sturm

00:23:04.520 --> 00:23:08.150
and Drang passages to
represent the preparations for

00:23:08.150 --> 00:23:10.250
and execution of warfare.

00:23:10.250 --> 00:23:13.770
The music was first
published in the U.S. in 1793.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:17.650
And inspired many new solo piano
works based on American battles

00:23:17.650 --> 00:23:20.650
from the Revolutionary
and Civil wars as well

00:23:20.650 --> 00:23:24.660
as the Spanish-American
War a century later.

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.190
Musicologist Elizabeth Morgan
has recently published research

00:23:28.190 --> 00:23:30.280
on Civil War battle pieces.

00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:32.470
And her conclusions about
these works are helpful

00:23:32.470 --> 00:23:35.760
in understanding Shapiro's
music for Kishineff.

00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.940
First of all, Civil War
battle pieces were composed

00:23:38.940 --> 00:23:41.100
for domestic performances.

00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:44.300
Especially by amateur
female pianists.

00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:47.040
The importance of acquiring
piano skills for young women

00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.860
at the turn of the 20th
century is well-documented

00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:52.420
in home journals,
music periodicals

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:54.290
and other literature
of the time.

00:23:54.290 --> 00:23:59.280
In one 1892 book-length guide
for housewives titled "Queen

00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:02.740
of the Home," Emma Churchman
Hewitt considers piano playing

00:24:02.740 --> 00:24:04.990
as a key component
of home making.

00:24:04.990 --> 00:24:08.860
But lamented conditions in
which "Daughters were expected

00:24:08.860 --> 00:24:11.830
to make night hideous
and their lives a burden

00:24:11.830 --> 00:24:15.420
by their weary hours
of practice."

00:24:15.420 --> 00:24:18.150
Even Jewish women, many of
them being first generation

00:24:18.150 --> 00:24:21.820
immigrants, sought to prove
their talents on the piano.

00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.010
Joseph Rumshinsky, one of the
most prolific Jewish composers

00:24:25.010 --> 00:24:27.070
and arrangers of
the Yiddish theater,

00:24:27.070 --> 00:24:29.570
published many didactic
musical works.

00:24:29.570 --> 00:24:32.240
And describes his
clientele in his memoir

00:24:32.240 --> 00:24:34.460
"Klangen fun mayn lebn."

00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:37.600
He writes, "From 10:00
in the morning until 3:00

00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.200
in the afternoon, I taught
young women recently married

00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:43.090
who wanted to show their
husbands they could play piano.

00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:45.730
From 3:00 until 7:00 I
taught schoolchildren.

00:24:45.730 --> 00:24:48.170
And then from until 10:00
or 11:00 in the evening,

00:24:48.170 --> 00:24:52.610
I taught shop girls and office
girls who wanted to get married.

00:24:52.610 --> 00:24:55.840
Rumshinsky's students may have
been looking for a husband,

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.500
but their skills would have
also served as a conduit

00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:01.260
for the edifying messages
contained in works

00:25:01.260 --> 00:25:03.510
like Shapiro's "Kishineff
Massacre."

00:25:03.510 --> 00:25:06.860
The battle pieces served
as an entertaining vehicle

00:25:06.860 --> 00:25:11.040
for families to celebrate their
side's military achievements.

00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.670
Long before Facebook
news feeds and Twitter,

00:25:14.670 --> 00:25:18.090
battle pieces also supplemented
journalistic reports.

00:25:18.090 --> 00:25:21.390
Providing intricate details of
the fighting with a descriptive

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.490
and stirring musical
accompaniment.

00:25:23.490 --> 00:25:27.240
Not surprisingly, Northern
publishes printed works based

00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:28.670
on Union victories.

00:25:28.670 --> 00:25:29.970
And the triumphs

00:25:29.970 --> 00:25:32.700
of the Confederacy were
covered by Southern presses.

00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:35.720
Shapiro's massacre seems
counterintuitive in this regard

00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:39.880
as the pogrom was certainly not
a victory for Jews to celebrate.

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.070
On the other hand, the battle
genre offered appropriate means

00:25:43.070 --> 00:25:46.500
for transplanted families
to relate to the instability

00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:49.360
of Jewish life in Europe
while strengthening the piano

00:25:49.360 --> 00:25:54.790
technique of young women eager
to enter respectable society.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:57.230
Shapiro could have modeled
the composition on reports

00:25:57.230 --> 00:26:00.190
of the pogrom posted
in U.S. papers.

00:26:00.190 --> 00:26:02.920
As early as May 1903,
the "New York Times"

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:06.610
and "The Sun" published
unsettling eyewitness accounts

00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:08.010
of the violence.

00:26:08.010 --> 00:26:12.380
But Shapiro's descriptive music
mostly ignores specific details

00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.740
in favor of stock musical topics
commonly found in battle pieces.

00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:20.970
For example, many battle pieces
include a morning bugle call

00:26:20.970 --> 00:26:22.400
or reveille.

00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:24.850
And this is the one from
Kocvara's "Battle of Prague."

00:26:24.850 --> 00:26:27.140
And it's, you know,
it's trumpet music.

00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.940
This one goes.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:37.230

This is one from the
Battle of Gettysburg.

00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:46.930
And, again, very much what
we think of as trumpet music.

Although the published accounts

00:26:50.830 --> 00:26:53.890
of the pogrom do not
feature a bugle call,

00:26:53.890 --> 00:26:56.510
Shapiro includes the
bugle call of the rioters.

00:26:56.510 --> 00:27:09.130
[ Piano Music ]

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:10.740
Another obligatory section

00:27:10.740 --> 00:27:13.110
of battle pieces is
a musical depiction

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:15.640
of the violent acts
of war itself.

00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:18.940
Attack music has a long history
in western classical music.

00:27:18.940 --> 00:27:21.040
For one prominent example,

00:27:21.040 --> 00:27:24.380
the Italian composer
Claudio Monteverdi suggested

00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.020
in the 1638 preface of his
eighth book of madrigals

00:27:28.020 --> 00:27:31.000
that an agitated or violent
affect could be rendered

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:34.970
in music through a succession
of quick repeated notes.

00:27:34.970 --> 00:27:37.150
He put his theory into
use in the dramatic

00:27:37.150 --> 00:27:40.360
"Combattimento di Tancredi
e Clorinda" or "Combat

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.140
between Tancredi and Clorinda."

00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:46.630
In this short excerpt the
narrator describes a deadly duel

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:48.510
between the title characters.

00:27:48.510 --> 00:28:17.040
[ Music ]

00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:19.300
Monteverdi's so-called
agitated style caught

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:20.600
on throughout Europe.

00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:23.220
And could be heard in countless
pieces that describe battles,

00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.430
storms and violent behavior.

00:28:25.430 --> 00:28:27.040
In the late 18th century,

00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:30.440
composers for the piano often
used dexterous passage work

00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:33.450
at a quick tempo to
represent military action.

00:28:33.450 --> 00:28:37.180
And here's the attack music from
Kocvara's "Battle of Prague."

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.600
And you can see the
quick Alberti Bass figure

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:41.900
in the piano.

00:28:41.900 --> 00:28:44.830
And then these melodic figures,
two of them that I have circled,

00:28:44.830 --> 00:28:48.050
I'll come back to in a second.

00:28:48.050 --> 00:28:51.470
Shapiro's attack music, what
he labels as the hellish work

00:28:51.470 --> 00:28:54.000
in full force, fits
this paradigm.

00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.990
And the principal motive
is clearly borrowed

00:28:55.990 --> 00:28:57.440
from the "Battle of Prague."

00:28:57.440 --> 00:28:58.740
So you see the same figure.

00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:01.730
It goes kind of like
[music sounds].

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:07.210
And it's the same as the figure
in Kocvara's attack music.

00:29:07.210 --> 00:29:11.030
Elizabeth Morgan notes that
in Civil War battle pieces the

00:29:11.030 --> 00:29:13.810
attack music always
stays in a major key.

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:16.290
Shapiro, in contrast
to this tradition,

00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:19.330
tried to represent an
attack on Jews in his music

00:29:19.330 --> 00:29:20.690
and adds chromatic tones

00:29:20.690 --> 00:29:23.510
to create Jewish
sounding harmonies.

00:29:23.510 --> 00:29:26.110
At first the mode
merely shifts to G minor.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:28.480
But later on scaler
runs in arpeggios

00:29:28.480 --> 00:29:31.000
with augmented seconds
bring the ethnic nature

00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:32.910
of the conflict into focus.

00:29:32.910 --> 00:29:34.710
So now let's hear both examples.

00:29:34.710 --> 00:29:57.050
[ Piano Music ]

00:29:57.050 --> 00:29:59.510
Shapiro.

00:29:59.510 --> 00:30:29.290
[ Piano Music ]

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.580
Although the "Kishineff
Massacre" certainly borrows

00:30:31.580 --> 00:30:33.540
from the battle music tradition,

00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.080
it notably does not
contain actual battle music.

00:30:37.080 --> 00:30:39.700
Instead Shapiro focuses
on the victims,

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.410
directing the listener towards
the work's didactic function.

00:30:43.410 --> 00:30:47.610
Many battle pieces include
a brief lamentation section

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:50.700
to represent fallen troops
on either side of the fight.

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.250
So here's one from the
"Battle of Waterloo" from 1910.

00:30:55.250 --> 00:30:59.380
And you can see it's, the
title "Lamentation," adagio.

00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:00.680
So it's slow.

00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:02.200
Con expressione or
with expression.

00:31:02.200 --> 00:31:05.790
It's a very lyrical and
subdued piece of music.

00:31:05.790 --> 00:31:08.590
This is a very interesting
one from Charles Grobe's

00:31:08.590 --> 00:31:09.890
"The Battle of Fort Donelson."

00:31:09.890 --> 00:31:14.270
And in this case the
music is very choral-like.

00:31:14.270 --> 00:31:17.910
Like something a four-part
choir might sing in church.

00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:20.500
The music is actually
"My Country Tis of Thee."

00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:24.860
And the text is the names
of the Northern soldiers

00:31:24.860 --> 00:31:26.420
who had died in the battle.

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:28.210
And you can see them
all listed there.

00:31:28.210 --> 00:31:30.620
So if you were performing
this piece at home

00:31:30.620 --> 00:31:33.230
and someone was narrating the
work, they would actually read

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:36.450
through all the names, you
know, possibly people you know

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.750
who died in the battle.

00:31:37.750 --> 00:31:44.210
So it's a very affective
way of lamenting the fallen.

00:31:44.210 --> 00:31:46.320
In the "Kishineff
Massacre," however,

00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:49.700
Shapiro composes more
lamentation than action,

00:31:49.700 --> 00:31:53.650
reserving three of the work's
seven sections for this purpose.

00:31:53.650 --> 00:31:56.030
Unlike the other parts
of the composition,

00:31:56.030 --> 00:31:59.450

For the descriptive labels
of the two other examples,

00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:53.280
Shapiro draws directly from
the text of Frug's poem.

Of special note is
the third lamentation

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:04.200
"The Living Cry for Bread."

00:33:04.200 --> 00:33:07.980
Which eludes to the refrain that
ends each stanza of the poem.

00:33:07.980 --> 00:33:11.340
And serves as the finale
of the entire composition.

00:33:11.340 --> 00:33:15.130
The refrain reads, "Brethren
sisters, mercy, mercy,

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.250
grave and awful is the woe.

00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.960
"The Living Cry For Bread"
is easily the longest section

00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.620
in Shapiro's massacre.

00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:30.170
Its stately tempo, mournful
character and repetition

00:33:30.170 --> 00:33:33.710
of motives heard in the first
two lamentation sections help

00:33:33.710 --> 00:33:37.220
create a suitable
anti-finale for the work.

00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:39.730
In a recent article on
descriptive piano works,

00:33:39.730 --> 00:33:43.000
Jonathan Bellman notes how
Kocvara's "Battle of Prague"

00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.620
and many other descriptive
works end with a familiar song.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:48.550
"The Living Cry For Bread"
is certainly the most

"The Living Cry For Bread"
to be heard as a paradigm

In short, Shapiro's

in the tradition of battle
music for solo piano.

to generate sympathy
for the Jewish cause.

00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:09.290
It is likely that well-to-do
Jewish families in America

00:36:09.290 --> 00:36:10.590
who would have already
been familiar

00:36:10.590 --> 00:36:13.550
with the battle genre could
easily understand its new

00:36:13.550 --> 00:36:18.450
context and be moved to act on
its charitable exhortations.

00:36:18.450 --> 00:36:20.030
While Shapiro's musical
depiction

00:36:20.030 --> 00:36:24.250
of the Kishineff pogrom does not
convey the Zionist sentiments

00:36:24.250 --> 00:36:27.130
common to the American
press reports, another work

00:36:27.130 --> 00:36:31.340
by the composer reveals how his
tragic Jewish battle piece might

00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:34.190
be aligned with the
Zionist cause.

00:36:35.210 --> 00:36:38.050
Shapiro would draw his audiences
further towards the Jewish

00:36:38.050 --> 00:36:40.630
poetics of domestic
music making with his

00:36:40.630 --> 00:36:43.410
"Dr. Herzl Elegy"
for solo piano.

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:46.760
Which he published in July
1904, five months after his

00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.970

with either Yiddish odes to
Herzl by George Selikowitz

00:38:27.630 --> 00:38:31.400

the same musical elements used

Furthermore, connections

00:38:36.530 --> 00:38:39.940
to European musical topics
are far less apparent

To the contrary, as German
musicologist Jascha Nemtosov

00:38:51.100 --> 00:38:54.180
notes in his book "Zionism
in Music," Shapiro turns

00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:57.500
to Klezmer, incorporating
authentic sounding tunes

00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.770

mimic the hammered dulcimer.

"Ring Cycle."

composer Richard Wagner,

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.470
but it is quite true.

And Shapiro may have
shared his enthusiasm.

00:39:57.130 --> 00:40:00.670
The three flat key signatures
seen throughout the elegy might

00:40:00.670 --> 00:40:03.040
be a reference to
Siegfried's funeral music

00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:05.040

And the musical material
in one section

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.430
of the elegy is reminiscent
of a Wagnerian leitmotif.

Other parts of the
elegy, however,

00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:14.730
show little Wagnerian influence.

On the other hand,

Herman Shapiro's most popular
printed work was a collection

of Jewish wedding dances.

00:41:10.790 --> 00:41:12.110
And it is just as possible

00:41:12.110 --> 00:41:16.330
that to compose the Herzl elegy
quickly he chose Klezmer idioms

00:41:16.330 --> 00:41:17.880
because he was already
adept at it

00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:21.410

00:46:35.620 --> 00:46:37.820
white America had become
increasingly anxious

00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:41.180
in the 1920s about the
so-called Jewish problem.

00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:42.900
And debates over
the place of Jews

00:46:42.900 --> 00:46:45.090
in American society
carried forth

00:46:45.090 --> 00:46:49.060
in published articles,
symposia and exposes.

00:46:49.060 --> 00:46:52.040
Furthermore, although America
had been the number one

00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.830
destination for Jewish
immigrants leaving Europe,

00:46:54.830 --> 00:47:01.000
the Johnson-Reed Act of
1924 restricted their entry,

00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.390
forcing many immigrants
to settle in Palestine.

00:47:04.390 --> 00:47:07.050
Given the unstable nature
of Jewish life in America

00:47:07.050 --> 00:47:10.840
at that time, it seems odd that
Victor would release a recording

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:13.570
that would remind Jews of
recent atrocities committed

00:47:13.570 --> 00:47:15.450
by a host nation.

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:16.750
On the other hand,

00:47:16.750 --> 00:47:19.400
record company executives
were not too concerned

00:47:19.400 --> 00:47:22.610
about the content of the
ethnic records they produced.

00:47:22.610 --> 00:47:24.760
From one example, L.L.C.
Book [assumed spelling],

00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.320
who was Columbia's
head of ethnic records,

00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:31.070
wrote in a 1920 issue of
"Talking Machine World" that

00:47:31.070 --> 00:47:33.750
"The foreigner is not particular

00:47:33.750 --> 00:47:35.750
in his selection
of foreign music.

00:47:35.750 --> 00:47:38.190
Simply he desires
music which reminds him

00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:40.320
of his old folks
and his old home.

00:47:40.320 --> 00:47:42.140
There's hardly any of
the foreign records

00:47:42.140 --> 00:47:43.840
which will not do this."

00:47:43.840 --> 00:47:48.200
The recording of the "Kishineff
Massacre" could certainly evoke

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.790
memories of Russia, although
not necessarily pleasant ones.

00:47:52.790 --> 00:47:56.100
The Victor recording also
suggests how Jewish American

00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:57.400
engagement with the plight

00:47:57.400 --> 00:48:01.340
of European Jews may have
changed by the 1920s.

00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:05.080
In a 1906 essay, "The
Menace of Mechanical Music,"

00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:08.310
America's most famous band
leader and composer of the era,

00:48:08.310 --> 00:48:11.370
John Philip Sousa raged
against the fledging

00:48:11.370 --> 00:48:13.460
phonograph industry.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:16.320
Above all other complaints,
Sousa argued

00:48:16.320 --> 00:48:17.620
that the proliferation

00:48:17.620 --> 00:48:20.260
of talking machines would
produce a terrible change

00:48:20.260 --> 00:48:21.930
in America's musical culture.

00:48:21.930 --> 00:48:25.500
Noting "For when music
can be heard in the homes

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:28.960
without the labor of study
and close application

00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:31.970
and without the slow process
of acquiring a technique,

00:48:31.970 --> 00:48:34.340
it will be simply
a question of time

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.010
when the amateur
disappears entirely."

00:48:37.010 --> 00:48:41.900
Although Sousa scholar Pat
Warfield has demonstrated

00:48:41.900 --> 00:48:45.740
that Sousa was more interested
in revising copyright laws

00:48:45.740 --> 00:48:48.050
than protecting America's
musical heritage,

00:48:48.050 --> 00:48:50.730
Sousa's prophecy may be telling.

00:48:50.730 --> 00:48:54.600
In 1904, young Jewish women or
men may have practiced Shapiro's

00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:57.730
"Kishineff Massacre" for
hours, perfecting their skills

00:48:57.730 --> 00:49:00.500
of execution and interpretation.

00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:02.990
They would have performed the
piece at family gatherings,

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:05.460
showing off their talents
while sharing the work's

00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.650
urgent message.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:08.950
Any one in the house

00:49:08.950 --> 00:49:11.010
or apartment during
practice sessions

00:49:11.010 --> 00:49:14.830
or performances may have seen
the sheet music, asked questions

00:49:14.830 --> 00:49:16.750
and learned about the situation.

00:49:16.750 --> 00:49:19.680
The 1924 recording,
on the other hand,

00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.580
would require much less
engagement from its audience.

00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:24.900
And serve more as a
memorial of the pogrom

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:26.440
than a call to action.

00:49:26.440 --> 00:49:29.940
Now, I'd like to conclude
by discussing the placement

00:49:29.940 --> 00:49:33.640
of this recording in Victor's
catalog of ethnic records.

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.620
The international concert
orchestra's discography covers a

00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:39.270
variety of ethnic styles.

00:49:39.270 --> 00:49:41.050
Which the label could
have easily marketed

00:49:41.050 --> 00:49:43.220
to various immigrant groups.

00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:45.540
Most of the choices
are nostalgic.

00:49:45.540 --> 00:49:47.650
There are waltzes
for the Viennese.

00:49:47.650 --> 00:49:49.920
Music by Edvard Grieg
for the Norwegians.

00:49:49.920 --> 00:49:51.750
And folk songs for the Russians.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:55.870
The only international concert
orchestra disc that was marketed

00:49:55.870 --> 00:50:00.030
to Jews and features what one
might call Jewish music is this

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:02.080
"Kishineff Massacre."

00:50:02.080 --> 00:50:03.380
The listing suggests that,

00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:06.500
whereas some immigrant groups
wanted to dance the night away

00:50:06.500 --> 00:50:09.340
or sing folk songs,
the Jewish community,

00:50:09.340 --> 00:50:11.490
20 years after Kishineff,

00:50:11.490 --> 00:50:13.600
preferred to contemplate
their suffering

00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.710
and fragile safety
among gentile nations.

00:50:16.710 --> 00:50:20.110
Perhaps Shapiro's "Kishineff
Massacre" helped establish a

00:50:20.110 --> 00:50:22.530
soundtrack for such a practice.

00:50:22.530 --> 00:50:24.330
Thank you.

00:50:24.330 --> 00:50:53.070
[ Applause ]

&gt;&gt; The battery must be dead.

00:50:54.570 --> 00:50:55.970
&gt;&gt; I can talk loud too.

00:50:55.970 --> 00:50:57.420
I can talk very loud, okay.

00:50:57.420 --> 00:51:02.520
So you talked there at
the end about the printer

00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:06.950
or the publisher, Victor and
their context of this record.

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:08.640
I was wondering about
the publisher

00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:09.940
of the sheet music itself.

00:51:09.940 --> 00:51:15.410
So was that a Jewish publisher
marketing for Jewish audiences?

00:51:15.410 --> 00:51:18.850
Or were, did they also
have other, I don't know?

00:51:18.850 --> 00:51:20.150
[ Multiple Speakers ]

00:51:20.150 --> 00:51:21.450
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
As far as I can tell,

00:51:21.450 --> 00:51:22.750
[inaudible] Jewish publisher.

00:51:22.750 --> 00:51:24.050
Asna Goldberg, yeah.

00:51:24.050 --> 00:51:25.350
&gt;&gt; Say that again,
Ray, I'm sorry.

00:51:25.350 --> 00:51:26.940
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: Yeah,
that was a Jewish publisher.

00:51:26.940 --> 00:51:30.930
I don't know if he published
Jewish music exclusively,

00:51:30.930 --> 00:51:32.280
but he published a lot of it.

00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:36.020
Obviously the ties between
the "Kishineff Massacre"

00:51:36.020 --> 00:51:39.430
and the score for a
"Eli, Eli," I mean,

00:51:39.430 --> 00:51:41.900
it shows he has a
distinct marketing niche.

00:51:41.900 --> 00:51:44.460
And the Hebrew titles on
the, it's Yiddish language

00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.650
but Hebrew letters
on there, you know,

00:51:46.650 --> 00:51:51.820
show who's supposed
to buy that stuff.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:53.120
Yes.

00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:54.420
&gt;&gt; Is Goldberg the first,

00:51:54.420 --> 00:51:56.000
Gershwin's first
biographer, I think?

00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.300
Does anyone know that?

00:51:57.300 --> 00:51:58.730
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
Asna Goldberg?

00:51:58.730 --> 00:52:00.600
&gt;&gt; Excuse me, I have
the name wrong.

00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.900
I'm sorry.

00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:03.200
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: Oh, sorry.

00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:05.990
&gt;&gt; Never mind.

00:52:05.990 --> 00:52:08.760
&gt;&gt; Thank you for an
excellent lecture.

00:52:08.760 --> 00:52:11.580
Really well-structured
and very informative.

00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:16.150
So in the introduction you,
your dissertation was referred

00:52:16.150 --> 00:52:21.690
to as an Italian
Renaissance whatever.

00:52:21.690 --> 00:52:26.270
And I'm curious, this is
kind of a far cry from that.

00:52:26.270 --> 00:52:31.400
So was there any relationship
in doing this kind of research

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.590
to what you originally did
your dissertation work?

00:52:34.590 --> 00:52:37.840
What did you bring to
this from that experience?

00:52:37.840 --> 00:52:39.690
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: I guess
I can answer that question

00:52:39.690 --> 00:52:43.530
by talking about how I got
into Jewish music studies.

00:52:43.530 --> 00:52:44.850
Which I did at the
same time I was working

00:52:44.850 --> 00:52:46.150
on my dissertation work.

00:52:46.150 --> 00:52:49.590
You know, I went to
Indiana University,

00:52:49.590 --> 00:52:52.080
and we have a great diverse
musicology faculty there.

00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:55.550
And I can also use this time to
thank some of my friends from IU

00:52:55.550 --> 00:52:56.850
who are in the audience tonight.

00:52:56.850 --> 00:52:59.900
There was a seminar at the time.

00:52:59.900 --> 00:53:02.310
I came studying musicology
thinking I would study

00:53:02.310 --> 00:53:03.610
early music.

00:53:03.610 --> 00:53:05.570
But we also, there's a
terrific scholar at IU,

00:53:05.570 --> 00:53:07.440
he's at University of
Illinois now, named Jeff Magee.

00:53:07.440 --> 00:53:09.960
And he had a seminar on
Jewish identity in music.

00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:12.170
And that's where i
was first introduced

00:53:12.170 --> 00:53:13.470
to a lost these ideas.

00:53:13.470 --> 00:53:15.640
I had performed Klezmer
music and studied

00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.440
that just as a performer.

00:53:17.440 --> 00:53:21.010
But in that seminar, for which
I was actually the only Jewish

00:53:21.010 --> 00:53:24.120
person in it, I really
enjoyed it very much.

00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:25.760
And it opened me up to
a lot ways of thinking

00:53:25.760 --> 00:53:27.880
about myself and
about this music.

00:53:27.880 --> 00:53:33.200
And I did my final project on a
living musician, David Krakauer,

00:53:33.200 --> 00:53:34.910
a clarinetist and his music.

00:53:34.910 --> 00:53:37.370
And it was from that that I
got interested in this topic.

00:53:37.370 --> 00:53:41.040
And then, you know, I decided
to write my dissertation

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:43.570
on Italian music theory
because I really wanted

00:53:43.570 --> 00:53:44.870
to learn the language.

00:53:44.870 --> 00:53:48.530
And studying, learning
about Galileo's father.

00:53:48.530 --> 00:53:50.430
All that stuff was
very fascinating.

00:53:50.430 --> 00:53:52.200
But, you know, it's
easy to draw back,

00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:54.340
to get into Jewish music for me.

00:53:54.340 --> 00:53:56.280
And so this was my
childhood and everything

00:53:56.280 --> 00:53:57.580
and growing up in the synagogue.

00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:00.050
And then all of a sudden
you're uncovering this history

00:54:00.050 --> 00:54:01.350
that you didn't know existed.

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:05.170
You know, so it was very, thing,
and the research was wonderful.

00:54:05.170 --> 00:54:07.280
Because every morning I would
get up, I would actually get

00:54:07.280 --> 00:54:09.220
to my office at the
university early just

00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:11.850
so I would have an
extra 30 or 45 minutes

00:54:11.850 --> 00:54:13.680
to build this database.

00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:16.980
And through these online
archives, I was, you know,

00:54:16.980 --> 00:54:18.370
finding information
of all these records.

00:54:18.370 --> 00:54:20.330
And listening to just
hundreds and hundreds

00:54:20.330 --> 00:54:21.750
and hundreds of records.

00:54:21.750 --> 00:54:23.790
And just realizing how
much stuff was out there.

00:54:23.790 --> 00:54:29.130
So I don't know, I think
there's probably some connection

00:54:29.130 --> 00:54:30.950
between the early music.

00:54:30.950 --> 00:54:33.590
But I think mostly they're just,
I just like a lot of music.

00:54:33.590 --> 00:54:35.300
I like everything.

00:54:35.300 --> 00:54:38.040
And so any time I
can work on something

00:54:38.040 --> 00:54:39.800
that interests me is great.

00:54:39.800 --> 00:54:41.120
Thanks for the question.

00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:44.160
&gt;&gt; I hope I'm doing this right.

00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.460
I'm not sure.

00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:46.760
But maybe you can
hear my voice anyway.

00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.060
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:54:48.060 --> 00:54:51.320
&gt;&gt; The "Kishineff Massacre" was
also the impetus for the region

00:54:51.320 --> 00:54:54.930
of the American Jewish
Committee in 1906.

00:54:54.930 --> 00:54:56.910
And that was a formation
of a group

00:54:56.910 --> 00:55:00.960
of wealthy German-Jewish
Wall Street bankers who felt

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:03.070
that the Kishineff
massacre simply could not be

00:55:03.070 --> 00:55:04.420
tolerated anymore.

00:55:04.420 --> 00:55:06.400
And they had to take
some action.

00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:09.420
You mentioned also that
it was the impetus for,

00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:13.560
was it Jewish participation
in the formation of the NAACP?

00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.860
And another group?

00:55:14.860 --> 00:55:16.160
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: The ACLU.

00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.460
&gt;&gt; The ACLU.

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:19.030
Could you expand a little bit.

00:55:19.030 --> 00:55:20.330
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
Mostly what I know is

00:55:20.330 --> 00:55:22.800
from Eric Goldstein's book.

00:55:22.800 --> 00:55:24.530
But, I mean, or, no, that was

00:55:24.530 --> 00:55:25.880
from Steven Zipperstein's
lecture.

00:55:25.880 --> 00:55:28.690
But Eric Goldstein talks a
lot about this in the book

00:55:28.690 --> 00:55:30.080
"The Price of Whiteness."

00:55:30.080 --> 00:55:33.680
And things I know about
Jewish-black relations

00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:35.750
from scholars such
as Cheryl Greenberg

00:55:35.750 --> 00:55:37.690
who wrote a great
book about that.

00:55:37.690 --> 00:55:41.300
You know, I think these
were social issues.

00:55:41.300 --> 00:55:43.210
I'm not an expert in this area.

00:55:43.210 --> 00:55:46.910
But they were social issues that
Jews, and especially the Jews

00:55:46.910 --> 00:55:49.680
in New York, it sort of
established themselves

00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.350
in America, they wanted
to get involved in.

00:55:51.350 --> 00:55:52.990
They were just very active.

00:55:52.990 --> 00:55:57.510
And you're right, this pogrom
is seen as a turning point.

00:55:57.510 --> 00:55:58.810
I think there's a famous article

00:55:58.810 --> 00:56:01.450
about the Kishineff Pogrom
called "The Turning Point,

00:56:01.450 --> 00:56:02.800
the Kishineff Pogrom."

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:07.960
I think the ADL was also formed
shortly after this pogrom.

00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.980
Because it was, the idea
was that Jews need a,

00:56:10.980 --> 00:56:12.510
we need somebody
to protect them.

00:56:12.510 --> 00:56:15.400
Because living in these towns,
and they have no protection

00:56:15.400 --> 00:56:17.120
when these things happen.

00:56:17.120 --> 00:56:18.980
As far as their involvement
in the NAACP,

00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:22.090
I believe the organization
was started mostly by Jews

00:56:22.090 --> 00:56:27.130
as I guess, in a kind of
social activism, saying we need

00:56:27.130 --> 00:56:29.630
to protect, you know,
this minority in America.

00:56:29.630 --> 00:56:31.530
Because they don't have
people protecting them.

00:56:31.530 --> 00:56:33.490
The same with ACLU.

00:56:33.490 --> 00:56:35.370
This is an organization that
protects people's rights.

00:56:35.370 --> 00:56:40.410
So how, it was the Kishineff
massacre that caused all this

00:56:40.410 --> 00:56:43.020
to happen, Zipperstein
at least claims it's

00:56:43.020 --> 00:56:46.440
because there was this
person Jacob Bernstein-Kogan

00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:50.760
in Kishineff who was very much
involved in political Zionism.

00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:54.170
And he knew this was the
kind of political event,

00:56:54.170 --> 00:56:55.750
not that he's exaggerating
the event.

00:56:55.750 --> 00:56:57.400
But it's, you know,
that's in politics,

00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:59.500
right, you use an event.

00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:03.340
If I have an agenda,
say it's gun control.

00:57:03.340 --> 00:57:05.310
When there's a shooting
somewhere, I'm going to say,

00:57:05.310 --> 00:57:06.710
let's talk about gun control.

00:57:06.710 --> 00:57:08.010
Here's why.

00:57:08.010 --> 00:57:10.490
The Kishineff Pogrom is a great
time for [inaudible] to say,

00:57:10.490 --> 00:57:11.790
look, we need a homeland.

00:57:11.790 --> 00:57:13.090
Heres why.

00:57:13.090 --> 00:57:14.390
And so that just, you know,

00:57:14.390 --> 00:57:15.690
spurned all these
other activities.

00:57:15.690 --> 00:57:17.510
I don't know much
about the formation

00:57:17.510 --> 00:57:19.050
of these organizations though.

00:57:19.050 --> 00:57:26.540
&gt;&gt; I believe that
Zipperstein has a book coming

00:57:26.540 --> 00:57:29.020
out early next year on
the Kishineff Massacre.

00:57:29.020 --> 00:57:31.740
And I believe it's something
like "The Kishineff Massacre

00:57:31.740 --> 00:57:33.380
and the Tilt of History."

00:57:33.380 --> 00:57:35.410
So that should be
well worth reading.

00:57:35.410 --> 00:57:36.730
I was going to ask you,

00:57:36.730 --> 00:57:39.410
could you tell us a little
bit more about Shapiro.

00:57:39.410 --> 00:57:41.740
Was he born in the U.S.?

00:57:41.740 --> 00:57:48.540
How did he come to be so,
have such a career in music?

00:57:48.540 --> 00:57:50.760
Obviously, not easy teaching

00:57:50.760 --> 00:57:53.010
with a teaching schedule
like that.

00:57:53.010 --> 00:57:55.390
But what were some of
his other achievements,

00:57:55.390 --> 00:57:56.690
et cetera, et cetera?

00:57:56.690 --> 00:57:57.990
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: I
haven't found much about him.

00:57:57.990 --> 00:58:00.970
I haven't really dug
into the archives.

00:58:00.970 --> 00:58:02.670
When I did some archival
work on this project,

00:58:02.670 --> 00:58:03.970
I was studying other musicians.

00:58:03.970 --> 00:58:05.490
I came to Shapiro later.

00:58:05.490 --> 00:58:07.410
So all I know, you know,

00:58:07.410 --> 00:58:11.420
the Irene Heskes catalog here
lists all of his publications.

00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:13.100
Obviously, that review

00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:15.630
of a concert is conveniently
inside one of his pieces

00:58:15.630 --> 00:58:17.340
of sheet music so
anyone can see it.

00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:19.730
I really don't know
much about him.

00:58:19.730 --> 00:58:21.490
I, you know, I've looked.

00:58:21.490 --> 00:58:22.790
I've looked in YIVO.

00:58:22.790 --> 00:58:24.640
I couldn't find anything on
YIVO's website or anything

00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:26.620
in their library catalog.

00:58:26.620 --> 00:58:29.200
So I really don't know.

00:58:29.200 --> 00:58:32.560
You know, he's not a musician
who's really been picked

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:35.750
up by other, you know,
performing ensembles.

00:58:35.750 --> 00:58:38.740
You don't hear about this
music being performed much.

00:58:38.740 --> 00:58:40.500
Because the music is kind of,

00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.930
it's not really concert
music like Liszt or Chopin.

00:58:43.930 --> 00:58:46.360
It's really, you know, was
designed for these, you know,

00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.320
domestic performances.

00:58:48.320 --> 00:58:50.110
So, sorry, I don't know,

00:58:50.110 --> 00:58:51.410
I really don't know
much about him.

00:58:51.410 --> 00:58:53.710
I'm, it's somewhat, this
paper is very speculative.

00:58:53.710 --> 00:58:55.770
Although I think most of it
works together pretty well,

00:58:55.770 --> 00:58:58.070
pieces together pretty well.

00:59:04.380 --> 00:59:05.860
&gt;&gt; Just curiosity.

00:59:05.860 --> 00:59:10.650
Since you started with
the Italian Renaissance

00:59:10.650 --> 00:59:13.540
and since there is
one major figure

00:59:13.540 --> 00:59:15.000
in the Italian Renaissance,

00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.960
Jewish background,
Salamone Rossi.

00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:23.390
I'm wondering if you have, in
the wanderings across the span

00:59:23.390 --> 00:59:28.960
of music, whether you see this
kind of musical expression

00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.410
as something of an assertion
of a separate Jewish identity.

00:59:33.410 --> 00:59:38.160
Whereas most of the
musicians, composers, at least,

00:59:38.160 --> 00:59:41.520
in many cases the performers
of Jewish background

00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:44.330
in the classical music
tradition going all the way back

00:59:44.330 --> 00:59:49.660
to the Renaissance, were kind of
trying to say more like, me too.

00:59:49.660 --> 00:59:53.850
I can be a part of a
more mainstream thing.

00:59:53.850 --> 00:59:57.820
Whether that is something
of a contrast that you see.

00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:03.300
And whether, in fact, something
like a massacre of this,

01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.230
even though it's not
that large a massacre.

01:00:05.230 --> 01:00:09.600
But the effect it has on
the world's imagination,

01:00:09.600 --> 01:00:13.750
not just Jewish imagination is
a pivot point in that regard?

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:15.050
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: Thanks.

01:00:15.050 --> 01:00:16.350
That's an interesting question.

01:00:16.350 --> 01:00:19.430
Yeah, Salamone Rossi is a
perfect example of a composer.

01:00:19.430 --> 01:00:21.530
Writes in Hebrew, but it
sounds like Palestrina.

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.170
It's just gorgeous polyphony.

01:00:24.170 --> 01:00:26.050
When I look at this stuff,
I look through it more,

01:00:26.050 --> 01:00:29.430
not so much, I talked about
a lot of the background

01:00:29.430 --> 01:00:30.730
of this music and kind

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.070
of Western European
classical traditions.

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:37.390
This is more of like
mass-marketed popular music.

01:00:37.390 --> 01:00:40.330
And in America around the
turn of the 20th century,

01:00:40.330 --> 01:00:42.680
there's so much of this
going on in Tin Pan Alley

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.040
and all the publishing houses.

01:00:44.040 --> 01:00:46.330
And they're working
very hard to appeal

01:00:46.330 --> 01:00:48.300
to distinct marketing niches.

01:00:48.300 --> 01:00:53.160
So using these, you know,
almost kind of stereotypes

01:00:53.160 --> 01:00:57.670
of what might sound Jewish
works really well to show

01:00:57.670 --> 01:00:59.710
that that is supposed
to be Jewish music.

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:03.260
It's a little bit like how in
silent films or in cartoons

01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:06.330
or something, if in a cartoon
of a Jewish person comes

01:01:06.330 --> 01:01:07.890
on the screen, you have
to hear "Hava Nagila."

01:01:07.890 --> 01:01:11.740
It's like, you know, it's a
little bit cartoonish like that.

01:01:11.740 --> 01:01:14.550
And it's, yeah, there is
a lot of cantorial music

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:15.850
that sounds like this.

01:01:15.850 --> 01:01:17.150
And, you know, certain types

01:01:17.150 --> 01:01:19.090
of Jewish worship music
that sound like this.

01:01:19.090 --> 01:01:23.600
But it's so much more I think
the composer as marketing

01:01:23.600 --> 01:01:26.210
to their audience
to me in a sense.

01:01:26.210 --> 01:01:30.650
There are all kinds of
debates at this time.

01:01:30.650 --> 01:01:33.000
One is by the writer,

01:01:33.000 --> 01:01:35.990
Lazare Saminsky was a
Russian-Jewish composer.

01:01:35.990 --> 01:01:38.460
And he writes in his book
on "Music in the Ghetto

01:01:38.460 --> 01:01:42.420
and the Bible," saying
that all this kind of,

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:45.290
I hate to use the term
"exotic inflection."

01:01:45.290 --> 01:01:47.220
But what musicians would
call augmented seconds.

01:01:47.220 --> 01:01:49.090
All these things are
actually corruptions

01:01:49.090 --> 01:01:50.760
of real Jewish music.

01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:53.030
That the real music of the Bible
wouldn't have had these things.

01:01:53.030 --> 01:01:56.380
It was just picked up by Jews
wandering through Central Asia.

01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:58.800
So there's always
kind of disputes.

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:01.710
But in America I
think still, you know,

01:02:01.710 --> 01:02:04.140
if people want something to
sound Jewish, they play a tune

01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:06.000
and they have, you know, they
those intervals in there.

01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:08.190
And people say, oh, that's
supposed to represent Jews.

01:02:08.190 --> 01:02:10.190
That's the way I'm kind of
looking at it in this paper.

01:02:10.190 --> 01:02:14.260
You know, if you look at later
in the 20th century into someone

01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:15.720
like Leonard Bernstein.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:17.470
Some, the things he
puts in his symphonies.

01:02:17.470 --> 01:02:21.680
When he's quoting the blessing
before reading a Haftarah

01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:22.980
in one of his symphonies.

01:02:22.980 --> 01:02:26.960
I mean, clearly he's trying to
create, you know, a Jewish sound

01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:29.060
that the Jews will
recognize as being Jewish.

01:02:29.060 --> 01:02:31.280
And it's similar to that.

01:02:31.280 --> 01:02:33.710
But it's hard for me to think

01:02:33.710 --> 01:02:35.950
of Herman Shapiro the same
way I might think of someone

01:02:35.950 --> 01:02:37.400
like Felix Mendelssohn.

01:02:37.400 --> 01:02:38.850
Because you know he's
someone who is really trying

01:02:38.850 --> 01:02:41.730
to show he's part of the
western classical tradition.

01:02:41.730 --> 01:02:45.040
Or Meyerbeer or some of
those other composers.

01:02:45.040 --> 01:02:46.990
He's writing music
to a mass market.

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:51.150
He's not so much writing
music to please, you know,

01:02:51.150 --> 01:02:54.020
the "Neue Zeitschrift
fur Musik" in Germany.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:57.290
He's writing for his, you know,
for people to buy sheet music.

01:02:57.290 --> 01:03:00.460
I don't know if that
answers everything.

01:03:00.460 --> 01:03:10.220
&gt;&gt; You mentioned the of
speed of the communication

01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:14.730
and the publications in the
U.S. about the massacre.

01:03:14.730 --> 01:03:18.330
And I'm curious about the
back influence or knowledge

01:03:18.330 --> 01:03:25.270
or awareness of the music, this
composition or the reaction

01:03:25.270 --> 01:03:30.510
in America back in,
where it happened.

01:03:30.510 --> 01:03:33.420
And the surrounding communities.

01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:34.720
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: It's hard.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.030
I haven't found, as
I wrote in the paper,

01:03:36.030 --> 01:03:39.520
I really haven't found
documented performances.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.200
Si it's hard, you know, it's
hard to find information

01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.500
about something people
would have done

01:03:43.500 --> 01:03:45.570
at home without doing that.

01:03:45.570 --> 01:03:47.420
And it's interesting
because I've had,

01:03:47.420 --> 01:03:50.800
with other obscure Yiddish songs
that I've studied as relative

01:03:50.800 --> 01:03:53.680
to this research, I've
sometimes found those songs

01:03:53.680 --> 01:03:56.140
in very obscure newspaper
articles.

01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:59.760
Saying the board of,
you know, Jewish people

01:03:59.760 --> 01:04:01.120
in this town met,
and they had songs.

01:04:01.120 --> 01:04:03.510
And this person sang this song.

01:04:03.510 --> 01:04:06.690
Sometimes I'll actually find
a documented performance.

01:04:06.690 --> 01:04:11.650
But for this music
I'm not sure I would.

01:04:11.650 --> 01:04:13.410
&gt;&gt; I was thinking
more generally, not.

01:04:13.410 --> 01:04:14.710
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: Yeah.

01:04:14.710 --> 01:04:16.010
&gt;&gt; Necessarily specifically.

01:04:16.010 --> 01:04:18.870
But was there, you know, was
there two-way communication?

01:04:18.870 --> 01:04:25.000
Was it mostly, you talked about
this network that existed.

01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.770
And how much support they felt
from what was happening here.

01:04:30.770 --> 01:04:33.490
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: Oh, the
community back in Russia.

01:04:33.490 --> 01:04:34.790
&gt;&gt; Yes, yes.

01:04:34.790 --> 01:04:36.090
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
That's a good question.

01:04:36.090 --> 01:04:37.540
I know a lot of money
was raised.

01:04:37.540 --> 01:04:41.330
And there was a lot of money
and there was a lot of all kinds

01:04:41.330 --> 01:04:42.630
of benefits being done.

01:04:42.630 --> 01:04:45.230
There was a lot of activity
in Washington about it.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:46.750
They really wanted
the U.S. government,

01:04:46.750 --> 01:04:49.530
people really wanted the U.S.
government to get involved.

01:04:49.530 --> 01:04:55.580
I'm not sure what happened
in those communities though.

01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:58.650
I can't think of anything.

01:04:58.650 --> 01:05:00.580
You know, mostly what I read

01:05:00.580 --> 01:05:02.870
in my research was all
these writers visiting there

01:05:02.870 --> 01:05:04.410
and then writing about it.

01:05:04.410 --> 01:05:06.440
For example, that Irish
author I mentioned.

01:05:06.440 --> 01:05:09.670
There's some famous
Jewish poets who went there

01:05:09.670 --> 01:05:11.690
and wrote these other poems.

01:05:11.690 --> 01:05:13.910
Ones called I think
"Streets of Blood."

01:05:13.910 --> 01:05:17.030
That all Israelis now,
I believe, know very,

01:05:17.030 --> 01:05:18.970
am I getting the
name of it right?

01:05:18.970 --> 01:05:20.270
[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:05:20.270 --> 01:05:23.130
Yeah, but what's?

01:05:23.130 --> 01:05:24.430
&gt;&gt; Bialik poem.

01:05:24.430 --> 01:05:25.730
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
Yeah, the Bialik poem.

01:05:25.730 --> 01:05:27.030
&gt;&gt; His response.

01:05:27.030 --> 01:05:28.330
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg: Right.

01:05:28.330 --> 01:05:29.630
He went there.

01:05:29.630 --> 01:05:30.930
&gt;&gt; [inaudible] a year after.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:32.230
The city of.

01:05:32.230 --> 01:05:33.530
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
"The City of Blood."

[ Inaudible Comment ]

01:05:34.830 --> 01:05:36.130
Yeah, "City of Blood."

01:05:36.130 --> 01:05:37.430
Right. And so some in of
these works of [inaudible].

01:05:37.430 --> 01:05:38.920
I know that I've gotten
away from your question.

01:05:38.920 --> 01:05:42.150
But, yeah, I'm not sure
about what the people

01:05:42.150 --> 01:05:43.450
in the community knew.

01:05:43.450 --> 01:05:45.610
I know they knew funding
was coming in and,

01:05:45.610 --> 01:05:46.910
you know, aid and help.

01:05:46.910 --> 01:05:49.480
But a lot of them were just
mostly probably trying to get

01:05:49.480 --> 01:05:51.290
out of there and get to America.

01:05:51.290 --> 01:05:53.970
1903 they could still immigrate.

01:05:59.800 --> 01:06:01.100
&gt;&gt; Great. Well, thanks so much.

01:06:01.100 --> 01:06:02.400
We really appreciate it.

01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:03.700
&gt;&gt; Randall Goldberg:
Well, thanks a lot.

01:06:03.700 --> 01:06:05.380
Thanks for having me.
