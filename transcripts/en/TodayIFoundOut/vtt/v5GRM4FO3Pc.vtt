The Curious Tale of Turnspit Dogs

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:14.710
Considering how most dogs in the Western world
these days are treated as a member of the

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:19.250
family, it’s often easy to forget that the
vast majority of our furry friends up until

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:22.590
very recently were bred for a specific purpose.

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:27.410
Perhaps no dog was bred for a more specific
purpose than the now extinct, turnspit.

00:00:27.410 --> 00:00:32.050
The turnspit was so named because it was literally
bred just to run for hours on a tiny wheel

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.190
that turned a spit.

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:35.190
No, really, that was all it did.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:38.949
You see, a few hundred years ago the generally
preferred method for cooking a large piece

00:00:38.949 --> 00:00:43.399
of meat evenly was to put it on a spit and
rotate it until it was fully cooked.

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:48.100
Cooking meat thoroughly on a spit takes anywhere
between 40 and 80 minutes per kilo depending

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.050
on which meat it is you’re cooking.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:54.079
Needless to say, roasting an adult hog on
the fire for a party took an incredibly long

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:55.079
time.

00:00:55.079 --> 00:00:59.469
Prior to the introduction of turnspits around
the 16th century, the painstakingly tedious

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:04.089
and unrelenting job of turning the spit was
left to the lowest ranking member of the household,

00:01:04.089 --> 00:01:08.119
“usually a small boy“, though in larger
households the size of the spit necessitated

00:01:08.119 --> 00:01:10.000
delegating the job to an adult.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000
The job was tough, cruel and often resulted
in the poor soul tasked with doing it suffering

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000
from burns, blisters and exhaustion.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.530
What made the job more difficult was that
the spitjacks, as they were known, had to

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.200
work in full uniform.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.090
In fact, during Tudor times, spitjacks working
in Hampton Court were told that they had to

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:29.130
stop working in the nude as well as to stop
urinating in the fireplace.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.899
While we’d like to say that spitjacks were
replaced by dogs out of concern for their

00:01:32.899 --> 00:01:36.780
health, the truth is that dogs could work
longer hours without a break and they didn’t

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:38.780
need to be paid in anything other than food.

00:01:38.780 --> 00:01:43.770
This is why in 16th century, spitjacks were
phased out in favour of a small machine powered

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.500
by an even smaller dog.

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:48.000
So were the dogs treated any better than the
spitjacks?

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.000
Nope.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.479
Turnspits were generally seen more as kitchen
tools than fuzzy members of the household

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:57.009
who needed just as many belly rubs and chin
scratches as normal dogs.

00:01:57.009 --> 00:02:01.359
Along with being subjected to the same long
hours and awful conditions as the human spitjacks

00:02:01.359 --> 00:02:04.960
before them, turnspits would often be cruelly
mistreated by their owners.

00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:08.420
For instance, to train them to run at the
correct speed, a common method was simply

00:02:08.420 --> 00:02:12.410
to throw a hot coal into the dog’s wheel
every time it slowed too much.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:15.980
During their off-time, the exhausted turnspits
were known to work great as footwarmers.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.239
Turnspits were ultimately replaced by steam-powered
machines and by the end of the 19th century

00:02:20.239 --> 00:02:22.220
the breed officially was declared extinct.

00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:26.099
Intriguingly, it appears that people from
the early 19th century were well aware that

00:02:26.099 --> 00:02:28.270
the turnspit breed wasn’t going to last.

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:32.459
For example, in the book, Memoirs of British
Quadrupeds, published in 1809, in regards

00:02:32.459 --> 00:02:35.930
to the turnspit the author wrote “It is
now on the decline; and, in the course of

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.180
another century it will probably be extinct
in Great Britain“, which mirrors the breed’s

00:02:40.180 --> 00:02:42.099
actual fate almost perfectly.

00:02:42.099 --> 00:02:45.349
Despite the fact that, for a few centuries,
the turnspit could be found in almost every

00:02:45.349 --> 00:02:49.360
large home in England, including the homes
of royalty, nobody anywhere bothered to note

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.659
down exactly what breeding process went into
creating the dog that had ensured so many

00:02:53.659 --> 00:02:55.900
people had evenly cooked dinners.

00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.410
All we have to go on are historical descriptions
of the breed which described it as “long-bodied”,

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:01.939
“crooked-legged” and “ugly”.

00:03:01.939 --> 00:03:04.810
We also have a single stuffed specimen called
Whiskey.

00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:09.409
It’s not all bad though; the horrific treatment
turnspits were subjected to is reportedly

00:03:09.409 --> 00:03:14.150
what inspired Henry Bergh to start the American
Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals,

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:40.599
which in turn has resulted in countless animals
being saved from abuse 

00:03:40.599 --> 00:03:41.499
and cruelty.
