Walter benezia so Walter's been working

00:00:29.570 --> 00:00:29.580
Walter benezia so Walter's been working
 

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.460
Walter benezia so Walter's been working
on this web series for a while now so

00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:31.470
on this web series for a while now so
 

00:00:31.470 --> 00:00:33.260
on this web series for a while now so
Walter needs a set piece built for one

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:33.270
Walter needs a set piece built for one
 

00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:36.020
Walter needs a set piece built for one
of the scenes in his web series and it's

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:36.030
of the scenes in his web series and it's
 

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:38.540
of the scenes in his web series and it's
actually like a visiting room in a

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:38.550
actually like a visiting room in a
 

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:41.150
actually like a visiting room in a
prison but the cubicles with like the

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:41.160
prison but the cubicles with like the
 

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:42.590
prison but the cubicles with like the
telephones and you're talking through

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:42.600
telephones and you're talking through
 

00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:44.900
telephones and you're talking through
the glass and stuff that so I think I

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:44.910
the glass and stuff that so I think I
 

00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:46.130
the glass and stuff that so I think I
have an idea of how I can build that

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:46.140
have an idea of how I can build that
 

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:49.759
have an idea of how I can build that
relatively quickly and cheaply so let's

00:00:49.759 --> 00:00:49.769
relatively quickly and cheaply so let's
 

00:00:49.769 --> 00:00:51.320
relatively quickly and cheaply so let's
go take a look at some of the materials

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:51.330
go take a look at some of the materials
 

00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:52.490
go take a look at some of the materials
and stuff like that that I've set aside

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:52.500
and stuff like that that I've set aside
 

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.520
and stuff like that that I've set aside
and we'll just start building and see if

00:00:55.520 --> 00:00:55.530
and we'll just start building and see if
 

00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:03.430
and we'll just start building and see if
it all comes together

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:03.440
 

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.250
all right so this is my idea I'm gonna

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:07.260
all right so this is my idea I'm gonna
 

00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:09.200
all right so this is my idea I'm gonna
use an existing tabletop this folding

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:09.210
use an existing tabletop this folding
 

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:11.270
use an existing tabletop this folding
table it's about two feet by four feet

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
table it's about two feet by four feet
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.170
table it's about two feet by four feet
and I went and bought some cheap frames

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:15.180
and I went and bought some cheap frames
 

00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.340
and I went and bought some cheap frames
at Michaels

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:16.350
at Michaels
 

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:21.380
at Michaels
these are 18 by 24s and it was 50% off

00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:21.390
these are 18 by 24s and it was 50% off
 

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:25.310
these are 18 by 24s and it was 50% off
so I think the two of them maybe cost me

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:25.320
so I think the two of them maybe cost me
 

00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.930
so I think the two of them maybe cost me
like 12 bucks so these will be our

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:26.940
like 12 bucks so these will be our
 

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.400
like 12 bucks so these will be our
windows I'm gonna take the backing out

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:28.410
windows I'm gonna take the backing out
 

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:30.980
windows I'm gonna take the backing out
of them and so we'll have two

00:01:30.980 --> 00:01:30.990
of them and so we'll have two
 

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:33.500
of them and so we'll have two
side-by-side that'll be our window I've

00:01:33.500 --> 00:01:33.510
side-by-side that'll be our window I've
 

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.620
side-by-side that'll be our window I've
got some MDF board two foot by two foot

00:01:36.620 --> 00:01:36.630
got some MDF board two foot by two foot
 

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.219
got some MDF board two foot by two foot
pieces that are going to be our dividing

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:40.229
pieces that are going to be our dividing
 

00:01:40.229 --> 00:01:42.890
pieces that are going to be our dividing
walls basically for the phone's the

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:42.900
walls basically for the phone's the
 

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:46.100
walls basically for the phone's the
receivers these receivers these I went

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
receivers these receivers these I went
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:48.200
receivers these receivers these I went
to American science and surplus and you

00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:48.210
to American science and surplus and you
 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:51.410
to American science and surplus and you
can buy just the phone receiver it's

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:51.420
can buy just the phone receiver it's
 

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.840
can buy just the phone receiver it's
kind of like a retro thing that they are

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:53.850
kind of like a retro thing that they are
 

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:55.070
kind of like a retro thing that they are
promotional kind of thing that they were

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:55.080
promotional kind of thing that they were
 

00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:56.270
promotional kind of thing that they were
doing where you can plug it into your

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:56.280
doing where you can plug it into your
 

00:01:56.280 --> 00:02:12.460
doing where you can plug it into your
actual cell phone and stuff hello

00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:12.470
 

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:14.860
alright so this would be the phone but

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
alright so this would be the phone but
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.780
alright so this would be the phone but
I'm probably up the painted black they

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:17.790
I'm probably up the painted black they
 

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:19.070
I'm probably up the painted black they
do make him in black but they didn't

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
do make him in black but they didn't
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.140
do make him in black but they didn't
have any when I was there but I think

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:21.150
have any when I was there but I think
 

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:22.820
have any when I was there but I think
actually online I could have ordered

00:02:22.820 --> 00:02:22.830
actually online I could have ordered
 

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.860
actually online I could have ordered
some but I prefer to just pick him up

00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:24.870
some but I prefer to just pick him up
 

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.170
some but I prefer to just pick him up
well while I was already at the store so

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:27.180
well while I was already at the store so
 

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.000
well while I was already at the store so
that's some black spray paint will spray

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:29.010
that's some black spray paint will spray
 

00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:31.700
that's some black spray paint will spray
them up and I've got these little tool

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:31.710
them up and I've got these little tool
 

00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:34.700
them up and I've got these little tool
brackets a package of them I got at a

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:34.710
brackets a package of them I got at a
 

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:37.910
brackets a package of them I got at a
dollar store for a buck and so I think

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:37.920
dollar store for a buck and so I think
 

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.020
dollar store for a buck and so I think
that'll work

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:39.030
that'll work
 

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:42.710
that'll work
glue to the side to hang up the phone or

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:42.720
glue to the side to hang up the phone or
 

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.300
glue to the side to hang up the phone or
whatever it'll be I've got some

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:44.310
whatever it'll be I've got some
 

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:46.160
whatever it'll be I've got some
different fasteners and stuff like that

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
different fasteners and stuff like that
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:48.290
different fasteners and stuff like that
but that's about it I think I'm just

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:48.300
but that's about it I think I'm just
 

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.630
but that's about it I think I'm just
gonna use these materials these will be

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:50.640
gonna use these materials these will be
 

00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:53.809
gonna use these materials these will be
my partitions these will be my windows

00:02:53.809 --> 00:02:53.819
my partitions these will be my windows
 

00:02:53.819 --> 00:02:57.050
my partitions these will be my windows
and I'm gonna paint everything gray so

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:57.060
and I'm gonna paint everything gray so
 

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:00.500
and I'm gonna paint everything gray so
that it kind of has that I guess prison

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:00.510
that it kind of has that I guess prison
 

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:04.190
that it kind of has that I guess prison
feel and yeah I'll probably dirty it up

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:04.200
feel and yeah I'll probably dirty it up
 

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.600
feel and yeah I'll probably dirty it up
a little bit touch it up make it look a

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:05.610
a little bit touch it up make it look a
 

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.640
a little bit touch it up make it look a
little bit used but this is going to be

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:07.650
little bit used but this is going to be
 

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:10.370
little bit used but this is going to be
our core base of materials so let's

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:10.380
our core base of materials so let's
 

00:03:10.380 --> 00:05:46.130
our core base of materials so let's
start building and see what happens

00:05:46.130 --> 00:05:46.140
 

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.900
all right so that's about it

00:05:48.900 --> 00:05:48.910
all right so that's about it
 

00:05:48.910 --> 00:05:50.670
all right so that's about it
a few of things that maybe you didn't

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:50.680
a few of things that maybe you didn't
 

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.100
a few of things that maybe you didn't
notice the cables I use the cables that

00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:53.110
notice the cables I use the cables that
 

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:54.450
notice the cables I use the cables that
the phones came with we're sort of the

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:54.460
the phones came with we're sort of the
 

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:57.630
the phones came with we're sort of the
standard coiled cable they don't have

00:05:57.630 --> 00:05:57.640
standard coiled cable they don't have
 

00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.840
standard coiled cable they don't have
those in prisons usually it's like a

00:05:59.840 --> 00:05:59.850
those in prisons usually it's like a
 

00:05:59.850 --> 00:06:03.630
those in prisons usually it's like a
metal flexible cable so that they don't

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:03.640
metal flexible cable so that they don't
 

00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:05.400
metal flexible cable so that they don't
pull it out I guess and use it as weapon

00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:05.410
pull it out I guess and use it as weapon
 

00:06:05.410 --> 00:06:07.500
pull it out I guess and use it as weapon
or something yeah I didn't have anything

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:07.510
or something yeah I didn't have anything
 

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:10.890
or something yeah I didn't have anything
like that but I have a lot of extra

00:06:10.890 --> 00:06:10.900
like that but I have a lot of extra
 

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:13.680
like that but I have a lot of extra
speaker wire so I pulled some of that

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:13.690
speaker wire so I pulled some of that
 

00:06:13.690 --> 00:06:16.710
speaker wire so I pulled some of that
off cut it into pieces and actually what

00:06:16.710 --> 00:06:16.720
off cut it into pieces and actually what
 

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:18.720
off cut it into pieces and actually what
I did is to shoot a screw through the

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:18.730
I did is to shoot a screw through the
 

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:22.830
I did is to shoot a screw through the
other end of my little bracket here into

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:22.840
other end of my little bracket here into
 

00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:26.640
other end of my little bracket here into
the cable to hold it into place so it's

00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:26.650
the cable to hold it into place so it's
 

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:30.780
the cable to hold it into place so it's
kind of tight in there doc like this I

00:06:30.780 --> 00:06:30.790
kind of tight in there doc like this I
 

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.360
kind of tight in there doc like this I
don't I'm gonna ask Walter if he wants

00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:33.370
don't I'm gonna ask Walter if he wants
 

00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:34.680
don't I'm gonna ask Walter if he wants
me to put some kind of a little graffiti

00:06:34.680 --> 00:06:34.690
me to put some kind of a little graffiti
 

00:06:34.690 --> 00:06:37.790
me to put some kind of a little graffiti
or something like that a little bit and

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:37.800
or something like that a little bit and
 

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:40.710
or something like that a little bit and
probably on the visitors side not the

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:40.720
probably on the visitors side not the
 

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:42.660
probably on the visitors side not the
prisoners ahead yeah I wound up taking

00:06:42.660 --> 00:06:42.670
prisoners ahead yeah I wound up taking
 

00:06:42.670 --> 00:06:45.210
prisoners ahead yeah I wound up taking
this piece of wood here and putting some

00:06:45.210 --> 00:06:45.220
this piece of wood here and putting some
 

00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.940
