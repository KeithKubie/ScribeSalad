TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hello.

00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:02.700
I'm Timothy Jordan,
and this is your update

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.130
about the coolest developer news
from Google in the last week.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:09.480
The Android Instant Apps
SDK 1.1 is now available,

00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:12.140
with some highly requested
features such as improved NDK

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.630
support, configuration APKs
for binary size reduction,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.960
and a new API to maintain
the user's context when

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:22.140
they transition from an instant
app to the installed app.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.700
More details and
links to get started

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.150
are on the post linked
in the description below.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:30.210
There are new features in
Firebase Test Lab for Android,

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:33.300
including Robo test
improvements, faster test

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.570
results, and support for
Android Test Orchestrator.

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:39.390
More details and
links are on the post.

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:42.900
API.AI is now
known as Dialogflow

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:44.970
and is still your
end-to-end platform

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.640
for building great
conversational experiences.

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:49.800
Recent launches include
an inline code editor

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:52.680
and multilingual agent support.

00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:55.260
We recently released
TensorFlow Lattice,

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:57.420
a set of pre-built
TensorFlow estimators

00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.360
that are easy to use,
and TensorFlow operators

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:02.095
to build your own
lattice models.

00:01:02.095 --> 00:01:04.470
There's a lot of details here,
so I'll recommend you just

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:07.230

for a detailed explanation

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:10.140

We recently released beta
gems for Stackdriver,

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.190
our monitoring, logging,
and diagnostics suite.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.630
Now you can use Stackdriver
in your Ruby projects

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:20.180
wherever they happen to be.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.860

00:01:22.860 --> 00:01:25.080
The App Engine Firewall

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:27.060
to your App Engine app
[INAUDIBLE] set of rules

00:01:27.060 --> 00:01:30.450
and is now generally available
and ready to secure access

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.770

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:38.400
When we first announced the
rollout of the new AdWords

00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:40.410
experience back
in March of 2016,

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.620
our goal was to introduce
a faster and more intuitive

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:46.200
AdWords that's focused on
helping you reach your business

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.160
goals.

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:48.930
This new AdWords
experience is now

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.090
