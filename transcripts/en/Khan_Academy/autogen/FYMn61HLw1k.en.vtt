00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:03.070
 In previous videos we saw that we can half 

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:07.810
 Curves using a positional function 

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:11.020
 In very general terms, the point of x (or x) 

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:13.750
 A time function multiplied by a vector in a unit 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:15.260
 Horizontal direction. 

00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:19.010
 Plus the position of the y-point as a time function multiplied by y = y 

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.040
 Vector unit in vertical direction. 

00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:25.120
 This is an example that explains the idea, if 

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.160
 If you imagine a particle, suppose the variable 

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:28.620
 G represents the time g = t 

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.030
 This function will describe the position of the particle at any given time g = t 

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:34.630
 If we want a certain curve to say, that is 

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:40.220
 It is applied only to a given curve - and the curve we want, that it is t (g) t (g) = r (t) 

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:44.130
 And it is applicable in the period g greater than g = t 

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:46.710
 Of a, and less b. A = a, b = b 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.740
 Thus we described a curve 

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:50.060
 In two dimensions. 

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:51.120
 I will draw the curve here 

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:54.920
 So far we have not done more than a quick review on the last 2 videos 

00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.050
 This curve, it may sound something like this 

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.840
 Where g equals t (a) 

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.610
 Thus, when g is equal to (t = b) 

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.260
 Thus, R (a) is this vector r (a) 

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:08.440
 And ends at this point. 

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:11.170
 Here is the argument for (g) or time 

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:13.210
 It is possible to express anything, not just time 

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:15.300
 But we use time for easy presentation 

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:18.030
 The higher the g value we move 

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:20.310
 Or we choose a different point 

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.230
 On the track. 

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.070
 As we saw in the video before the previous. 

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:27.470
 In the previous video we discussed the 

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:31.110
 Meaning to take derived from a vector function 

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:34.030
 We came to this idea - it was not just an idea 

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.550
 In fact, we have shown it to be true. 

00:01:35.550 --> 00:01:37.530
 We have come to a true definition. 

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.980
 That derived g - we'll call it g '- it 

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.220
 You will be a vector. 

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.940
 Derived from a vector function 

00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:45.330
 Again it will be derived. 

00:01:45.330 --> 00:01:49.060
 As we define it - equal to 

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:54.690
 (G) multiplied by the unit vector in the direction of x + y (g) multiplied by the unit vector in the direction of x x '(t) i + y' (t) j 

00:01:54.690 --> 00:01:56.880
 It can also be written in another way - I will write all the different ways 

00:01:56.880 --> 00:01:59.160
 So that you will not be alienated from your knowledge if you see it in another place - 

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:04.740
 D (t) / d (g) = d (x) / d (g) ...... 

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.330
 D (o) / d (g) is a derivation code 

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:08.650
 O For time g. It is a standard quantity 

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:12.940
 The result is this derivative multiplied by the vector of unity in the direction of S. 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:17.610
 (D) (d) multiplied by the unit vector in the direction of p 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.680
 One way of thinking about the concept of derivation 

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:23.770
 Is that ... when I explain the special rates 

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:25.840
 With derivatives, the subject seems rather fluid 

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:26.950
 It is not very difficult 

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:29.855
 Imagine that you hit both ends of the equation in 

00:02:29.855 --> 00:02:37.590
 (D) = d (t) = d (t) = d (d) 

00:04:08.740 --> 00:04:10.120
 Horizontal orientation. 

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.110
 For the same curve
