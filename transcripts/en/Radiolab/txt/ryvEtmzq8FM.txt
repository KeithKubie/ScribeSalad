Speaker 1:          00:00          Ah, three, two, one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert Krulwich today on radio lab blame. All right. So tell me your name again. Bianca. Bianca, yeah. And I'm a quality name. Thank you. Yeah. Okay. So this is taped. It was sent to us, uh, by a radio producer named Bianca Gaver at the time she was in college just starting out a bike and across the country. Yeah. We just got this grant to bicycle around this summer and talk to you. Yeah, it's called Davis projects for peace. Oh Great. And she was riding through this part of Tennessee and ended up on this farm type place where she met this guy, Hector.

Speaker 2:          00:34          My name is Hector black. I'm 86, almost 86 and a half. When you get as old as I am, you add the halfs again like you did when you were three.

Speaker 1:          00:46          And Hector ended up telling Bianca story that in many ways turns everything we've learned in this hour on its head. Um, so yeah, where's, where would be the best parts place to start? I mean, I think the story starts when he decided to move to Atlanta because that's where Patricia was his daughter. Okay. He had fought in the war, a combat engineer, World War II. I was not a good soldier. Went to Harvard, got a degree, met his wife Suzy, and then

Speaker 2:          01:13          I did join the civil rights work in the 60s

Speaker 1:          01:18          I think when Hector heard about the civil rights movement, he actually packed up his bags, moved to the neighborhood where Martin Luther King Live, rented a house and said, what can I do to help? I felt that I wouldn't really understand what was going on unless I lived there. And that's when he meets Patricia girl in the neighborhood who came over all the time, just like a lot of kids. But she stuck around longer than, than anyone else. And at 11 years old she asked them, will you adopt me? Why are you explaining? Did you adopt Patricia? What happened? How'd you sure she, her mom

Speaker 2:          01:49          was an alcoholic. Sometimes she drank up the rent money and, and the kids were out on the street with their mom and dad. Mom, there was no dad and uh, so we took them in and she was very shy. She had impetigo sores on her legs in a nappy headed. Knew Your Mama, never braided her hair. She was just really a neglected child. And so she just blossomed.

Speaker 1:          02:12          She got into reading, sewing, painting. She made all her own clothes. She's making bridal gowns as a second source of income. And then she went off to college. She came back and started teaching kids to read. She even took it a few kids, just like he had done adopted a couple of kids. Yeah, he was too. She's a wonderful child. So unfortunately the whole story changes now in November of 2000 because that's when Patricia,

Speaker 3:          02:38          okay, who was murdered? Ivan Simpson is the name of the man who killed her. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          02:45          He had broken into her house looking for money and strangled her. And later the autopsy showed he sexually assaulted her too. At first, you know, eight yellow kill the bastard you guys saw, I saw it

Speaker 2:          03:00          kind of a monster. You would do a thing like this

Speaker 1:          03:03          and he said for almost a year he could not stop imagining

Speaker 4:          03:06          what he had done to her. These visions that come at me out of the blue just hit me. Okay. Did you get,

Speaker 2:          03:22          he just said no control. It was like he had control over me

Speaker 4:          03:27          pushing my face in the mud

Speaker 1:          03:29          after I haven't had confessed. And this was right after the murder, Hector said part of him did want Ivan to get the death penalty, but then this other part of him was like, no, this is a test. This was a test of his principles of his beliefs. And so he decided he would not pursue the death penalty

Speaker 2:          03:50          it at the trial, um, where he was sentenced, he refused to look at Ivan. Trisha's cousin got up first. She was just in tears and just said how much she hated him. I thought, oh Lord, I hear I'm going to go say something that's probably gonna hurt her feelings. And when it came his turn, I had a written statement because of unsure how steady my voice was going to be. But I was saying how much we love Patricia, how much she meant to us and how wounded we were by what had happened. And I said, I don't know if I've forgiven you. I haven't Simpson, but I don't hate you. I hate with all my soul what you did to my daughter. And then you worked up the nerve to turn around to face him to say the last thing I had written that said, I wish for all of us who had been so wounded by this crime, I wished that we might find God's peace and I wish that also for you. I even Simpson. And he says when he looked up, tears are streaming. Yeah, there's cheeks and you know, as the first time I looked into his eyes and it was like a soul inhale

Speaker 3:          05:07          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          05:07          I was just undescribable looking there

Speaker 1:          05:14          in the end. I haven't ended up getting life in prison without parole. What happens next was so surprising and troubling to us frankly, that we sent Bianca in our producer Andy Mills back down to Tennessee to talk to Hector again. Okay. So it's the night after the trial. Hector is laying in bed in the Mattel. I couldn't sleep that night and he kept thinking about that moment in the courtroom. I'd never, I'd never had it looked like that my whole life. Never before or since over and over and over and finally he just gets up. He grabs a pen and paper and he starts writing. Even Christopher Simpson, I am writing

Speaker 2:          05:58          because I wanted you to know how I feel after the court hearing Monday when I turned around while I was reading my statement and looked at you, it was a very powerful moment for me when you raised your tear stain face to look at me. Ever since this happened, I've been trying to find something good in all the horror and pain I have tried to be a better person

Speaker 1:          06:22          and then he writes this line maybe as a way to push himself to be that better person, but he writes, I forgive you

Speaker 2:          06:29          for what you did to our beloved daughter. I don't know if this will be of any comfort to you, but I wanted to tell you, we will both have to live our lives with the pain of this dude always there. Patricia tried to make the world a better place. We should also try

Speaker 3:          06:54          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          06:54          Did you think he would write you back after that? I didn't know, but about four weeks later a letter shows up.

Speaker 2:          07:02          Yeah. This is it. Dear Mr Hector, black and family, I first want to say, God bless you all in all things. Second, I have to go straight to the point. I know God has forgiven me. You have forgiven me, but I can't forgive myself. Not yet. Anyway. I have so much anger at myself right now. It's unbelievable. This hardness I have against mine, I will always be remorseful. I used to hear God speak to me all the time, but I guess after what I did, he took away his touch from me. Right? No, I miss his voice. I don't know that level of love Ms Patricia had, but if it's anything like your example of it, it is great. God comfort you all in everything. Few free to us. Me, anything you like. If I can, I will try to answer it.

Speaker 3:          08:12          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          08:12          dear Ivan, I was very glad to have your letter. I think it is important that we be as honest as possible with one another and so I have to tell you that it is hard for me to write to you. I wanted to know who he was. I would really like to hear about your life, about the people who loved you, the people who hurt you because I wanted to knew what had happened to him that could make it possible for me to do with the length is

Speaker 3:          08:41          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          08:41          Ivan writes, Dear Hector, I was adopted when I was two days old. His mother was schizophrenia. This is Simpson. The one I call mom known took me in. He was raised by his grandmother's sister. She's 80 no, I used to have to stay over there with my natural mum while Marie, my mom, no had to work. My natural mom used to beat me. Blurt out. I'm glad I got rid of you when he was a little boy. Maybe about 11 or so. She took him and his younger brother and his little sister to a swimming pool. And you tried to drone all three. One sister died. He stood there. She drowned his little sister in front of him,

Speaker 1:          09:25          just the most horrible stuff. And so we asked him, having heard all this from Ivan, did he still blame Ivan or did he blame his mom or society or something else?

Speaker 2:          09:36          Well, I, I do blame him. I mean, he made the choices. He made the choices. There's no doubt about that.

Speaker 1:          09:43          But he says, knowing this also made a Monterey Bat.

Speaker 5:          09:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          09:48          dear Ivan, and tell Ivan about his life. I grew up in New York City, his family, two brothers. My parents argued and fought a lot. Basically his whole life story. I've always loved working with plans and after we left find the city and moved back to the country and I haven't wrote back

Speaker 2:          10:08          dear Hector, I was raised in the church, but after starting drugs and alcohol, I changed, responded dear Ivan, I don't think God has abandoned you dear Hector. You're the only one writing to me. No, we exchanged many, many letters

Speaker 1:          10:25          and at some point in this back and forth, this almost incomprehensible thing happens. Do you Hector? There are letters. First of all, thank you for the pictures. I never knew plum trees blossom. Really just become [inaudible] casual. My favorite bloom is the water lily blossom. They'd talk about flowers. It's beautiful things they'd read. Dear Ivan, thanks for your letters. I've been closing a story someone said to be because I thought you would enjoy it and sometimes you, Hector, just the most mundane details of their day,

Speaker 2:          10:57          just sitting around this Saturday evening been singing him is to myself

Speaker 1:          11:04          basically they became friends.

Speaker 2:          11:06          You knew Hector, you're right. I do sense of bone developing. Unusual because of the circumstances. Nope. At all. What I expected to happen, you know, and it's just so absolutely crazy. You're actually,

Speaker 5:          11:31          oh gosh.

Speaker 2:          11:37          Yeah. We, we, we started to send him Christmas packages and we see this box on the floor and then I think to myself, you crazy old man, you're Sydney Christmas packages for the man who murdered your daughter. What the Hell is [inaudible] with

Speaker 5:          11:51          you? So Cross so totally out of orbit or something and I guess that was because people don't do that. Maybe I'm trying to exact meaning from it. I don't know because I struggled so hard with y y

Speaker 3:          12:25          no.

Speaker 1:          12:25          Eventually after years of writing letters, Hector decided to ask that why question

Speaker 3:          12:32          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          12:33          in its most essential form. What happened that night? This one? This one. I just want you to know if you don't want to read this. Oh yeah, we don't. We don't want to make you read this. If you, if you're not, you're not ready. I don't think it's, this might be a good time to say that. This next part is disturbing. If you have kids or you're just not in the mood, now's a good time to duck out for a few minutes.

Speaker 2:          12:56          Dear Hector, I wasn't going to tell you. Oh, what happened until you asked. I'm also glad you're relieving me of details. Also. God bless you. I went into the house around 7:30 PM I'm used to breaking into place in the past, so I figured the house was total dark, so I broke out a whole window and climbed in. I took the VCR and TV and clock. I figured that was enough. Went and gut $80 worth of drugs. I'm a heavy users, so it went in about one hour.

Speaker 1:          13:35          So he made his way back to Trisha's house.

Speaker 2:          13:38          It was still dark. So I went back in.

Speaker 1:          13:40          He found his way into the bedroom. I

Speaker 2:          13:42          saw a computer in Stereo, so I said I take it and that should last for the night. But I got trapped when I saw a car, so I hid until I could get back out the way I came. So I saw a lady walk to the room. I tried to be quiet so I could escape. When she opened the door to a closet, I was hiding. As she stepped back, she fell. I told her I was going to tie her up so it would have time to get away. She said, okay sir. Her glasses fell off and at no time she saw my face so I told her I was going to take the car so I could load it up. She gave me the keys so I told her after I found out her name, I said, Patricia, I know you're scared but I will be out of here in about 15 minutes. Then she said, you should get help with your drug problem. I told her I tried in the past but I restarted or yeah, that's, that's Trish. She had no compunctions about telling people off when they were in the room and then I, I'm sorry for this, I'm going to leave your car in the shopping center up the street next to the Chinese restaurant because all I need the car for was to transport the items I had

Speaker 1:          15:03          and even though Trish was tied up around her hands, she went into the kitchen and warmed up some chicken and rolls for Ivan.

Speaker 2:          15:10          Then I said, I'm sorry, and I left again. I got rid of the things, got about $200 well a hundred dollars drugs and $100 cash. Then I said, well, I just parked the car at the end of the driveway. Then I couldn't wait. I pulled over and smoked some of the crack cocaine

Speaker 1:          15:30          and at this point he's really high and he explained that when he gets this high, he's sometimes here's a male voice in his head and as he was walking away, the voice said to him,

Speaker 2:          15:40          he said, well, go get you some sex. I told him, leave me alone, but next thing I know I'm walking back to her house. No police had come.

Speaker 1:          15:51          He burst through the door, ran to where Patricia was tied up and said,

Speaker 2:          15:55          did you have any money? Kind of wish. She said, look in my purse,

Speaker 1:          15:59          and then Ivan said that the voice in his head became his own voice and he said to her, I want some six

Speaker 3:          16:08          [inaudible].

Speaker 2:          16:08          She said, sir, you've been so nice. Why don't do that?

Speaker 3:          16:13          Yeah.

Speaker 2:          16:13          You said only way you going to do this if I'm dead. Okay then and it happened.

Speaker 1:          16:24          He strangled her, sexually assaulted her, then he ran away.

Speaker 2:          16:30          Sure. Around 2:00 AM I ran out of drugs.

Speaker 1:          16:33          You said that after he finished getting high, he started to wonder if he had dreamt it all up. So he made one last trip back to Patricia's house.

Speaker 2:          16:41          So I looked up at the house. No police and gate's still open. So now have peeps through the door. She was still laying there. So I said Patricia, Patricia,

Speaker 1:          16:51          and then the voice in his head told him to go back in one more time. He sexually assaulted her.

Speaker 2:          16:56          I couldn't believe what happened. So went to my mom has adopted mother and I said, Mama, it's something wrong. Moma, something wrong. She said, child, tell me what you're talking about. I couldn't tell her

Speaker 3:          17:18          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          17:18          I was really hoping they would kill me in the electric chair because I could, I shouldn't be able to live with myself and God after what I had done. I just don't know why I had to do it. Was it because of the items and the money? No. Getting caught later on in life. No control or power? No car? No. Because she saw my face. No, she didn't see me at no time fingerprints left on something. No, I just don't understand why I did it.

Speaker 3:          17:59          [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          18:00          well, I feel the pressure has left me for telling you first what happened. My mom doesn't even know. I've been keeping all this inside and it hurts. So I'm truly sorrowful for what happened. May God bless you all sincerely. Ivan

Speaker 3:          18:25          does it, did it help?

Speaker 2:          18:27          But any way to know?

Speaker 3:          18:30          Yes,

Speaker 2:          18:32          because I mean that sounded exactly like Trish, but she was, was a really the fearless, I mean a machine, Mr Burrito, I can't imagine what a horrible,

Speaker 3:          18:50          Oh God. And his chest

Speaker 2:          18:55          amazed that she could be so strong just to be raised because when you love somebody very much, you want to know about their last hours and

Speaker 3:          19:12          ah,

Speaker 2:          19:13          he, he just, he just wrote it in a way that I found very kind. I mean if you go grind is a weird word to put there, but

Speaker 3:          19:33          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          19:34          but that's the word he chose.

Speaker 3:          19:38          Hello

Speaker 4:          19:38          kind

Speaker 3:          19:48          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          19:49          after that letter, they still right? Yeah, they still write, they've been writing for 10 years now and Hector has folders and stacks of these papers in his basement. So only room in his house that he keeps locked.

Speaker 3:          20:11          [inaudible]
