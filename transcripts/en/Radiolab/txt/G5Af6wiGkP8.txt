Speaker 1:          00:00          Hey Leanne revamped, there is no sheen. Leann? Yes, he is Pronoun and element top right king, the most noble guy. If there was Shelia, how fine, why lie?

Speaker 2:          00:27          She might be

Speaker 1:          00:31          [inaudible]. I'm Jad Abumrad, I'm Robert Krulwich, Radiolab and today elements. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:45          I carried your oxygen and you walked beside me through the lobby commenting on the decor when you needed to stop for breath. Your hand ran light and steady by the ocean of breath twice. I remember I carried your oxygen. It was heavy. A bleak alloy.

Speaker 1:          01:13          Wow.

Speaker 2:          01:14          Steel

Speaker 1:          01:25          [inaudible] this hour is a collaboration with poets like the ones you heard and really are more of musicians, reporters and of course the periodic table of elements. Speaking of which

Speaker 3:          01:37          our producer Soren Wheeler, who's sodium sparked brain conceived to this entire show. He will lead us off. So this one starts with a story I heard from Jamie Lowe. She's a writer in Brooklyn and at the heart of this story is this particular 24 hour period in Jamie's life that um, she is uneasy about have, let's just set it up for one second. So what are we about to watch? I'm not actually exactly sure where it starts, but we're about to watch, I think the night before Valentine's Day, 2001 I eventually convinced her to sit down with producer Latif Nasser and sort of just walk us through the tape. Go for it. You're, you're in control there with the spacebar. All right.

Speaker 4:          02:17          Yeah. Mine your honor. [inaudible] Jamie. Hey Jamie. Mike.

Speaker 3:          02:23          It's nighttime. Uh, Jamie and her friend Mike, he's the one filming there outside his apartment in Brooklyn and the cameras pointed at a bunch of high school students who were just walking by. So what's the deal? Tell say you want to be

Speaker 4:          02:35          an actress, right? Yeah. Tell me you need to, I love that. Good for you. So yeah. Really? Yeah. That's so cool. It's by any other name would smell as sweet. Yeah. Is My enemy Montague. What's Montague? It is nor hand, nor foot, nor on north face, nor any other part belongs to the man. I'm like egging them on to recite it. Retain that dear perfection, which she owes with that, that title, everyone you adopt a name. And for the name, which is no part of the take all my sisters in a part of that same screaming babies. So wait, camera eventually turns to Jamie. She's sitting on the stoop, a huge curly hair, wide eyes, and she starts to sing the kids a song. It does. You know, cause I can't see, I was pretty convinced that I was like a great singer and rapper.

Speaker 4:          03:37          She likes sounded real voice. Good reviews. Sing a lot in. No, never. I am not as anger. I just started thinking like that. I don't know. What was it like? Well one of the audio drapes, it was fun to watch people react or she made people personally happy. Whoever she wanted. She would. We went to flea markets and she would talk to people and she would pull this spark out of them. It, it just felt like New York loved her. That's Mike Ryan Guy Holding the camera. Yes. He'd only met Jamie just three weeks earlier. Not long after we moved to New York and they pretty much instantly became friends. She was so positive. As I recall. She's talking to some little kids on a stoop, but then that next four or five hours was pretty defining. Yeah. By Cameron, my friends, they cut to Mike's apartment. I think you're just walking around and Umbra and open dress, sparkly red bra and plastic bag, plastic bag on the stomach. Belly dancing. You might have to shield your eyes, but okay. There we go. That's four hours.

Speaker 5:          04:48          That's my case. Sleeping. Oh boy. Okay. Combining. It's Valentine's Day, 2001 okay. That's Kumquats and Avocados. The kumquats I picked with my grandpa and then come Quechee hope three or four days ago. That's kind of true. There's three breakfast bows.

Speaker 4:          05:10          What is all that stuff? Cutting board. Cut Up power bars

Speaker 5:          05:15          from the President I gave you at tightening the cup of wine that we're going to drink and a cup of wine. Of course it's seven 40 in the morning, so do you need a nap or anything at noon or do you just keep [inaudible] oh, here's a dollar. Keep pouring my ink. Sure. Jamie, what's going to happen today? Today I'm going to contact him to face to debate. Core of Bush. Neda or rock 10 Fidel Castro. Yeah. He's an amazing man. [inaudible] okay. I'm going to have to be about any about anything, right? I didn't think that those scientists, this one. Yeah.

Speaker 4:          05:55          Were you, what were meaning that

Speaker 3:          05:58          literally, that you were going to go on MTV and debate Gore v Bush and then that is exactly what I had in mind for the day. I thought it was make-believe.

Speaker 6:          06:07          It seemed harmless. It just didn't occur to me that what I was seeing with somebody who had deviated substantially from who they wanted to do.

Speaker 5:          06:16          It's changed the world. Jesus Christ.

Speaker 3:          06:20          Eventually Mike got up, had to go to work. Jamie took off for a while and then later that day she showed up at his office and at first everything seemed sort of fine, but within 20 minutes she said, hey, tell you what, can we go to the roof really fast?

Speaker 5:          06:36          What?

Speaker 6:          06:38          And that immediately

Speaker 5:          06:40          we got me uncomfortable. Yeah.

Speaker 7:          06:43          So, okay, over pants, flo wrap around skirt. We are now going to the roof and you ready to be blown out your feet? You can hear, he is done. Like the day has been insane. This isn't the end of that day. Snowy seventh avenue rooftop.

Speaker 5:          07:07          What you, what does this anything, what is that piece of yarn? Mr Mike? Brian tonight can after work at five on top of the world at the World Trade Center by wireline. Yeah. If you want tonight set up January,

Speaker 3:          07:56          that's when at that point he was like done. We're done. Wow. Eh? Yeah. I mean,

Speaker 6:          08:08          yeah, that's when it, it hit me that, um, there is no way that any of this reflects what she would actually want. I don't know if delusional is a kind word here and if it's not, I apologize. But if she's delusional enough to think that we should get married, is she delusional enough to think she can fly? Will she be distraught when I say no, no. And will she, would she jump? And so I lowered the camera and I said, I'm afraid of heights and I want to go downstairs immediately. And I felt for the first time just fear. And I called her, I believe I called her mother first. Uh, leann. And I just said, my name is Mike. I'm a friend of Jamie's and um, I, I think she may be going through something and I don't know what I'm dealing with. I'm in over my head here.

Speaker 3:          08:56          When Mike called, I, uh, I just got on a red eye that night. That's Leanne Lantos, Jamie's mom. It was my job to get her to go back to her therapist so that we could get some medication in her for the end. This episode was not entirely a surprise. It had happened once before when Jamie was in high school. At that time, she was not sleeping at night, spinning around the room, talking nonstop about how she had to save Central America from disaster. During the first episode, Jamie ended up at a place called the neuropsychiatric institute at UCLA and she ended up being treated by this guy, Dr Mark de Antonio. He's a psychiatrist. She was in a very acute, manic, psychotic state.

Speaker 7:          09:43          I remember being sort of tackled by nurses to actually take my meds because I refused to. We didn't know if we would ever see our Jamie again. You know, that was, that was the scariest part. Everyone around me I think was really, really worried that I wouldn't come back.

Speaker 3:          10:02          But you did come back and it's what brought her back. That is actually the reason I got so interested in this story. So shortly after she was admitted, uh, Dr Dantonio told Jamie's parents we know what this is and we know how to treat it. And he said, she's the classic case of, of bipolar. I, there was no question and I'm, the drug of choice is lithium, which is not even a drug, but just this salt. And he's explained to us, um, you know, that she would need to, um, take three tablets of lithium, three tablets of this salt and it could bring her back when it works. It's just remarkable. Do you have memories of like what it was like to come back like that, what you were thinking or what it felt like?

Speaker 7:          10:52          That's really hard to describe. It's a little bit of like a slow realization of, uh, of like, oh, that was a weird thing that I did a week ago. Like, why did I do that

Speaker 3:          11:07          the first time she was actually lucid and coming back to herself again. The first words out of her mouth were, mom, it's not me. And I just, that just killed me.

Speaker 5:          11:25          [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          11:26          within a few weeks it was like the incident never happened. So bizarre. I mean I felt like here was this thing that's assault that I get to just take three of a day and and that was it. Totally normal, no side effects, no issues. She went off to college and just like flourish and it was great. Things were good for a long time and then after about six years she said, you know, I've been on this pill for six years, had no problems.

Speaker 3:          11:54          I'd like to go off it. Why don't we try to go off gradually than about a month after she was totally off lithium whack in Mike's apartment up all night. You were so tired just a minute ago. That's cause he told me I had to leave, but now I'm still here. I thought, oh totally manic episode all over

Speaker 5:          12:14          because I am whatever you say I am. That's it.

Speaker 3:          12:18          One of the things that kind of makes lithium that affected lithium has so spooky, and you hear this from a lot of people that have taken lithium to treat bipolar, is that lithium itself is so

Speaker 2:          12:30          simple. Lithium is an element, right? It's a single atom. This has been Lilly, he's a writer, runs a story, collider podcast. He's had some personal experience with psychiatric drugs and he's written about lithium. That to me was fascinating, but that a single Adam can change what we think of, of who we are. I mean, it's not even, not just Adam, it's Adam number three, the third element in the table. It's one of the simplest Adam's right? So we have, it's just three protons, four neutrons, three electrons. That's a pretty simple in that matter. I mean, it doesn't get much. It really is. This had never struck me when I was on Lexapro or Wellbutrin, which was the other one they put me on. You know, if you look at them, they look like what you expect a pharmaceutical drug to look like. There's a ring of carbon atoms and some other things stuck on it and they, they look like these big complex molecules and you're like, Oh yeah, I'm, I'm complex. My brand is complex. It takes this complicated thing to change it. And then you're confronted with just this Adam, it was found by accident that it works. You've just, yeah, it's not complicated to make, it's just a salt that you distill out and yet it has this profound effect.

Speaker 2:          13:39          The other thing I know about lithium that is, that is profoundly weird, is that you're not just saying my mind, my personality is being changed by an Adam. It's been changed by an Adam that was created directly in the Business Bank itself. So you have this, Adam formed in the big bang, goes through whatever it does, winding path to come onto the earth, gets dug up, turned into a pill given to someone. And that changes their affect in the world. And that to me is just, it's this profound reminder that the, the forces that shape everything in the universe are the same as the forces that are shaping who we are. And what we do and what our identity is.

Speaker 3:          14:25          It's possible that these forces shaped not just the people with bipolar disorder, but all of us think it was a woman ended up talking to a clinical psychiatrist and a fellow who told me about these studies, huge epidemiologic studies. The biggest one I think was in Japan. One was in Austria, one was in Greece, famous one in Texas in which they looked at communities that different levels of lithium with them in the water supply and we're talking about tiny, tiny amounts, micrograms. Those are a thousandth of the amount in a milligram. If you think of like a pill of lithium, well we're talking about amounts like 10000th of a pill, like that's the amount that we're dealing with here and these studies found by and large in towns that had a tiny bit more lithium in the water. Suicide rates were lower in some cases, as much as 30% I should say.

Speaker 3:          15:13          The Texas study, which is astonishing also shows that the towns that have the highest lithium level have lower felonies, thefts, rapes, and these are reputable, published studies. Nope. These studies are only showing us correlations, but there does at least seem to be some kind of connection and may be if there is a distinction, what the hell is it doing? Do they know why it works in the brain? Like do they know what it does? Well essentially no, it's still kind of a mystery. But here's a Marc de Antonio's theory. He says, we know that bipolar disorder involves a defect in a certain part of the brain. It's an area of the brain that has to do with controlling mood. So believe it or not, there's neurons in the brain that keep your mood. Even these neurons, they do their job by sort of passing electricity back and forth and that electricity is carried by sodium ions.

Speaker 3:          16:14          So the whole system is pretty much based on sodium. Lithium is very similar to sodium, so if you have lithium in the brain, the neurons will use that to communicate. They'll send lithium ions back and forth. And here's what's interesting. Lithium works just like sodium, but not as well. Lithium is similar enough in properties that it can be an a posture, but whatever it does, it just doesn't work as well. That's the key. He says, so then this area of the brain, the defective area of the brain that makes these moods flip on and off so intensely doesn't work as well and that stops a bipolar episode. That's so interesting that maybe it's sluggishness is what makes it good. Yup. Yup. Although he says that same trick where it can be a sort of sodium imposter but slower that can also cause the issues. Slight tremors in your hand.

Speaker 3:          17:05          You can have nausea, they can affect the kidneys, the balance of sodium. Your body is regulated partially through the kidneys and somehow lithium replacing it can be toxic to the kidneys, which actually brings us back to Jamie. After that episode in New York with Mike and the video, she went back on lithium and again, she was fine. In fact for the last 16 years she's been completely normal. But then a couple months ago I went to a new primary physician, mostly because I'm lazy and I didn't want to go to the upper west side to see my other doctor. And this doctor basically took my blood pressure and was like, you're gonna die. You need to go to the Er. It turns out her kidneys were failing and so she suddenly

Speaker 7:          17:50          had to make this choice that I could sort of just stay on lithium and you know, go to dialysis and get a transplant or that I had to switch and that now would be when I would switch that I had enough function left that I could you you have, you are in the middle of that decision now you feel like, or do you feel like it's decided? I think I'm going to switch. I think I made that decision. It's just that every psychiatrist in New York leaves for August because I don't know why, but they all disappear for August, all of August. And Mine said you should probably wait to switch until I come back. But I, I feel like I have a good group of people around me. I have a solid job. I, it's terrifying to court mania, but I also feel like there are a lot of effective drugs and that one of them is going to work. They won't be as cool as lithium though. Depakote sounds like. Oh God. Bra. You're on Deborah. As she was in the middle of that decision, Jamie did one last thing. She actually took a trip to Bolivia, which is where much of the world's lithium comes from. There's this place you can go and literally see these massive salt flats, which are just covered in mountains of lithium. I just wanted to see them. I wanted to experience them. I wanted to be near them. So I went,

Speaker 5:          19:23          uh,

Speaker 7:          19:23          it just looks like a hallucination. It looks like somebody could not have conceived of this landscape. You know, you have red lakes and you have flocks of flamingos and this like long salty expands that goes on for ever. Like it's just huge. It's enormous. Do you go up to a pile and put your hand on it? Yeah. You can.

Speaker 8:          19:47          You stand on it and you jump off the pile and like, yeah, I was makings kind of with the [inaudible]

Speaker 5:          19:54          no [inaudible]

Speaker 7:          19:58          and it was awesome.

Speaker 8:          20:01          I know I have to go off of it, but I really am. I mean gratitude is like not even the word. It's, I feel like this thing allows me to be me. It doesn't define me, but it allows for, you know, functionality and that sounds kind of Wonky, but it's like every day I get to work and it's because of that, like everything, you know, I'm just, I'm grateful to it for it service. I feel like it's, yeah.

Speaker 4:          20:37          Done.

Speaker 8:          20:39          It's done a lot for,

Speaker 4:          20:41          for me.

Speaker 8:          20:44          It worked so hard to get to me too. From the Big Bang to

Speaker 9:          20:48          now.

Speaker 1:          21:03          Uh, [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          21:05          produce your store on wheeler? No, Soren is made of elements though, not of lithium, which we should say only some of which was made in the big bang. Some of it was also made ne Supernova and we'll have one of those coming up. Special thanks to Ben Lilly and Harrington. Kay Redfield Jamison, Steve Lo and of course Jamie Lo. Jamie working on a book about her experiences with bipolar. It will be called grand delusions. This is a song from the band Sylvan. So we played them the last story in progress and they wrote a song about it.

Speaker 10:         21:49          Jen, do the last thing. Um, come phones to me. Compression scale. Wow. It's not me. Slamdance faster, faster. [inaudible] Diane [inaudible] came home

Speaker 1:          24:54          [inaudible]

Speaker 9:          24:54          that was Sylvan Esso with Jamie Song.

Speaker 11:         24:56          Do you want to talk? Bang. Hydrogen was there at zero hundred hours in the coke colored velodrome of dark matter gases, checking gases at Infinitum, chartreuse Flair, then a deafening birth ions of cosmos. Cartwheeling Pink, red, yellow, green, purple, blue, black and the spear of night. First I was a star, then a stain of water, then a kindergartner.

Speaker 9:          25:29          These poems, by the way, come from the two events that we held in New York City. We went to a emotive fruition, which is a wonderful organization run by Thomas Dooley, who is himself a poet. He summoned poets from all around the metropolitan area and for two nights they came to the Bell House in Brooklyn Botanic lab in Manhattan. And so far we have heard hydrogen by Sarah Salah, red by Ramsey for our gala, helium by Christine Kintana. Read by Junius, Abbott Pratt. And uh, I carried your oxygen a poem by David McLaughlin, read by Sam Breslin. Right. So next up I'm going to give you three claps. I don't know if you need that, but just just in case you need to sync it. There you go. Good TV guy. Okay, so a while back we ended up talking to a guy named Derek Muller who makes a youtube channel called [inaudible] awesome, super popular channel about science and engineering. And we called him because he's making a documentary about uranium. And we got to talking about what happens when you take two protons or neutrons and you just whack put them together. Yeah, it's, it's absolutely nuts. And that led to this really interesting conversation about the beginning of all elements. I mean, I feel like a little bit of backstory is worth saying. One

Speaker 6:          26:44          really important thing to know is that combining nuclei gives you energy. He says when you slam two particles together, they get squished. And in the squishing, they lose a little mass. That mass gets emitted as energy. This is equals MC squared. That's what's happening in the sun right now. So the sun is taking protons, individual protons and smashing them together, combining them. And that gives you energy. The energy of the sun, their last mass is the sunlight that we Baskin, it was mass. I have never thought of light as as former mass. Yeah, that's what a star does. He says it smashes little Adams like hydrogen together to make bigger. Adam's like helium and then bigger Adams like carbon and then even bigger atoms like oxygen and every little collision it's doing generates some energy which keeps the star going. Stars live by this process of sticking nuclei together, going from smaller nuclei, making bigger nuclei. The heavier the star, the more the smashing and bashing they can do in their core and the bigger and bigger nuclei they can form. But there are limits.

Speaker 1:          27:52          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          27:52          6 million years ago that there was this star giant star whey they got in our son and uh, it was just doing its thing, taken Adams and smashing them together. Combining. It's taken hydrogen atoms and making helium, taking helium Adams and making carbon, making oxygen, and as it's smashing all these nuclei together, it's releasing energy and getting bigger and bigger and bigger. But then there comes a point where sticking nuclei together no longer gives you energy. In that point is element number 26 iron. Once you formed iron, if you're a star, that's the end of life as you know it because iron iron is incredibly stable, one of the most stable nuclei in the universe. It's protons are tightly packed in there and so you can't force any more energy out of them, which means you have a core which is no longer going to give you energy. You can't cook up anything higher than, than the iron. That's it. But what happens to the star? Does it just become a big punk? What happens is

Speaker 1:          29:06          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          29:07          everything starts to collapse. Gravity takes over. That's the thing. A star maintains its size by the fact that there's all this energy going out to this dead iron core starts pulling everything back in and at this point, all of that stuff which is headed inwards, aluminum, oxygen, carbon, magnesium, silicon starts rubbing against each other and it starts getting real hot and real dense, and all of a sudden you get the supernova. That was the most pathetic supernova explosion. Can you put

Speaker 9:          29:42          in a sound effect to make that sound bath? To put it in the Mexico? It is actually our specialty. So even though we know there are no sounds in space for the purposes of your enjoyment, we present to you

Speaker 6:          29:54          the Supernova. So here's the beauty of it. Here's the beauty of the Supernova in the ridiculous excesses of energy that are there in the Supernova, right? In that ridiculously huge explosion, the biggest in the universe. There is so much energy there that actually what happens is you form these nuclei, which would not form under any other conditions. You know, iron hits carbon to form Germanium, silicon hits oxygen to form titanium. You start to get all of these bigger elements, including like gold, including the gold in your wedding ring. They need that extreme ridiculous excess of energy to form and then

Speaker 1:          30:38          it's done.

Speaker 6:          30:41          And what are you left with? You're left with a giant field of debris.

Speaker 1:          30:45          Okay.

Speaker 6:          30:46          Ah, there's carbon, there's oxygen, there's iron, there's silicon, there's hydrogen, there's helium. And it starts to clump together due to gravity. And the center of that, uh, which clumps together is our sun is mostly hydrogen and helium and it's like 99% of all the mass in our solar system. And then the other chunks, other bits and pieces start to clump together as well. They have a bit more angular momentum. So they're spinning around the outside and those are your planetesimals, your early planets and, and that is eventually how you get the earth and all of us
