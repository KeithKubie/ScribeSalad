00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:19.400
 
we've been exploring how people wear

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:19.410
we've been exploring how people wear
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:21.019
we've been exploring how people wear
bags and interact with their personal

00:00:21.019 --> 00:00:21.029
bags and interact with their personal
 

00:00:21.029 --> 00:00:24.529
bags and interact with their personal
items in transit as designers we're just

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
items in transit as designers we're just
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:27.290
items in transit as designers we're just
as methodical as we are artistic because

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:27.300
as methodical as we are artistic because
 

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:29.150
as methodical as we are artistic because
we have to consider the way things work

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.160
we have to consider the way things work
 

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:30.740
we have to consider the way things work
and we also have to consider how things

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:30.750
and we also have to consider how things
 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:32.810
and we also have to consider how things
look so there are research we found out

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:32.820
look so there are research we found out
 

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:34.370
look so there are research we found out
what the essentials would be of a

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:34.380
what the essentials would be of a
 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.630
what the essentials would be of a
typical student of the things they need

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
typical student of the things they need
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.209
typical student of the things they need
to have on a daily basis and our

00:00:38.209 --> 00:00:38.219
to have on a daily basis and our
 

00:00:38.219 --> 00:00:39.770
to have on a daily basis and our
ultimate goal is to have those people

00:00:39.770 --> 00:00:39.780
ultimate goal is to have those people
 

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:43.040
ultimate goal is to have those people
carry those items on their person to be

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:43.050
carry those items on their person to be
 

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.020
carry those items on their person to be
able to wear these jackets and go like

00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.030
able to wear these jackets and go like
 

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:47.720
able to wear these jackets and go like
they should facilitate movement and just

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:47.730
they should facilitate movement and just
 

00:00:47.730 --> 00:01:05.690
they should facilitate movement and just
doing things the research i work on

00:01:05.690 --> 00:01:05.700
doing things the research i work on
 

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:08.060
doing things the research i work on
specifically is autonomous multi-robot

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:08.070
specifically is autonomous multi-robot
 

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:09.740
specifically is autonomous multi-robot
exploration and coverage so are the

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:09.750
exploration and coverage so are the
 

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:11.750
exploration and coverage so are the
research that we do is coordination of

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:11.760
research that we do is coordination of
 

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.969
research that we do is coordination of
multiple robots and finding out how to

00:01:13.969 --> 00:01:13.979
multiple robots and finding out how to
 

00:01:13.979 --> 00:01:15.499
multiple robots and finding out how to
coordinate these robots in order for

00:01:15.499 --> 00:01:15.509
coordinate these robots in order for
 

00:01:15.509 --> 00:01:17.749
coordinate these robots in order for
them to do tasks so with these are

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:17.759
them to do tasks so with these are
 

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.820
them to do tasks so with these are
what's the blue thing is a six laser

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:19.830
what's the blue thing is a six laser
 

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:21.679
what's the blue thing is a six laser
rangefinder so what it does it's a it

00:01:21.679 --> 00:01:21.689
rangefinder so what it does it's a it
 

00:01:21.689 --> 00:01:24.140
rangefinder so what it does it's a it
throws beams of light at 180 degrees and

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:24.150
throws beams of light at 180 degrees and
 

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:26.149
throws beams of light at 180 degrees and
we thought it measures the distance to

00:01:26.149 --> 00:01:26.159
we thought it measures the distance to
 

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.410
we thought it measures the distance to
every object to them that amount and

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:27.420
every object to them that amount and
 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.149
every object to them that amount and
then it takes that information and

00:01:29.149 --> 00:01:29.159
then it takes that information and
 

00:01:29.159 --> 00:01:30.620
then it takes that information and
that's how it starts building a map so

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:30.630
that's how it starts building a map so
 

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:33.770
that's how it starts building a map so
while we might need light to be able to

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
while we might need light to be able to
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:34.999
while we might need light to be able to
go into this environment particularly

00:01:34.999 --> 00:01:35.009
go into this environment particularly
 

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:37.190
go into this environment particularly
something like a cave these robots don't

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:37.200
something like a cave these robots don't
 

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.020
something like a cave these robots don't
have that constraint how do these

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
have that constraint how do these
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:40.789
have that constraint how do these
different aspects coordinate to be able

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:40.799
different aspects coordinate to be able
 

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.490
different aspects coordinate to be able
to reach the complete the task that

00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:43.500
to reach the complete the task that
 

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.040
to reach the complete the task that
you're trying to accomplish

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:47.050
 
 

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:49.110
