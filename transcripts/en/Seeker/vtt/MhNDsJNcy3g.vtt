00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:06.130
Scientists have discovered a new insect that
has more legs, penises, and friends than me.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:08.340
Great.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.690
Hey creepy crawlers, Trace here for DNews!

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:18.150
In late 2016, a tiny new insect was found
in a cave deep within Sequoia National Park.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.970
This lil guy was a millipede, but not one
scientists had seen before.

00:00:21.970 --> 00:00:28.050
It came with 414 legs, no eyes, 200 poison
glands which secreted an unknown substance,

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.849
and… maybe most creepily, four penises.

00:00:30.849 --> 00:00:36.390
This multi-genitaled creature, named Illacme
tobini is evolutionarily related to a known

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:42.250
millipede groupcalled Illacme plenipes, which
actually has 750 legs -- more than any animal

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:43.250
on earth.

00:00:43.250 --> 00:00:47.000
And yet our interest still lies with, tobini
and his many peenees.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.140
They’re located at the ninth and tenth pair
of legs, and actually serve a dual purpose

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:54.400
as legs.

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.640
Really working that old “third and fourth”
leg joke.

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.579
These leg-penises are called “gonopods”,
and are present on other millipede species

00:01:00.579 --> 00:01:04.940
as well, although none with more than two.

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.299
But they don’t quite function in the same
way our mammal penises do.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.950
They scoop sperm from another part of the
body, called the gonopore, and use the gonopod

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.979
to push it into the female millipede’s cyphopods.

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:17.979
Penises for legs?

00:01:17.979 --> 00:01:20.600
Being a diplopodologist is way cooler than
I thought.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.229
What is more interesting is that millipedes
aren’t the only ones carrying multi-tools.

00:01:26.229 --> 00:01:30.549
The order of Squamata, which are scaled reptiles,
and includes all snakes, lizards, ALSO have

00:01:30.549 --> 00:01:33.420
multiple penises, although, again, not more
than two each.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.509
In some cases, each individual penis has two
tips, but that’s more like four tips total.

00:01:39.509 --> 00:01:43.549
These two penises are called hemipenes, oh
and fun fact, they’re usually covered with

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:47.200
spikes and hooks so they attach securely to
the female.

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.649
So, why do these animals have so much to give,
whereas us humans, and most other penis-bearing

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:53.500
animals, have to live life with their one
and only?

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.990
Well, a study published in the journal Nature,
from 2014 has an interesting evolutionary

00:01:58.990 --> 00:01:59.990
answer.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.880
See, the Squamata order, and reptiles in general,
are marked by their amphibious nature.

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.110
Hundreds of millions of years ago, their ancestors
were ocean dwelling, and eventually they sprouted

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.770
legs, and crawled onto the shore, getting
the best of both worlds.

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:18.500
But that’s a pretty tricky move, things
are different on land than they are underwater,

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:20.630
and one enormous difference is mating.

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:25.060
See, it may be simplistic to say but if you’re
mating in water, you’re really just squirting

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.060
out as much as you can and hoping that the
water carries it to the right place; and that

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.750
tends to work pretty well.

00:02:30.750 --> 00:02:35.280
On land though, indiscriminate spraying doesn’t
work too well, everything sort of just falls

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.280
to the ground.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:41.040
What this study in Nature found is that these
double genitalia were based on the position

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.810
of an orifice known as the cloaca.

00:02:42.810 --> 00:02:46.290
It’s found with amphibians, reptiles, birds,
and even some fish!

00:02:46.290 --> 00:02:50.470
As an animal develops, the cloaca signals
nearby cells and tells them to become a penis.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:56.380
Since reptiles evolved separately, their cloaca
is positioned differently for use underwater.

00:02:56.380 --> 00:02:59.750
Simply put, penises on reptiles are based
on their hind leg positions.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:05.290
So, whether you have one or two or four penises…
baby, you were born this way.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.430
And this begs the question to me, why do we
even have sex at all?

00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:10.250
Why don't we just breed asexually?

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:11.850
Find out in this video.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:14.780
