00:00:00.427 --> 00:00:01.870
- [Voiceover] There's a
lot of times, there's a lot

00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:04.157
of situations in which
we're studying something

00:00:04.157 --> 00:00:06.414
pretty straightforward and we can

00:00:06.414 --> 00:00:09.579
find an exact theoretical probability.

00:00:09.579 --> 00:00:11.135
So what am I talking about?

00:00:11.135 --> 00:00:12.326
Just let me write that down.

00:00:12.326 --> 00:00:15.947
Theoretical probabiity.

00:00:15.947 --> 00:00:17.955
Well, maybe the simplest example, or one

00:00:17.955 --> 00:00:21.344
of the simplest examples is
if you're flipping a coin.

00:00:21.344 --> 00:00:23.103
And let's say in theory you're flipping

00:00:23.103 --> 00:00:25.210
a completely fair coin and you're

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:27.822
flipping it in a way
that is completely fair.

00:00:27.822 --> 00:00:31.226
Well, there you know
you have two outcomes.

00:00:31.226 --> 00:00:34.563
Either heads will be on top
or tails will be on top.

00:00:34.563 --> 00:00:36.428
So theoretically you say, "well, look,

00:00:36.428 --> 00:00:37.531
"if I want to figure out the probability

00:00:37.531 --> 00:00:41.025
"of getting a heads, in theory I have two

00:00:41.025 --> 00:00:43.813
"equally likely possibilities, and heads

00:00:43.813 --> 00:00:46.854
"is one of those two equally
likely possibilities."

00:00:46.854 --> 00:00:49.490
So you have a 1/2 probability.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.509
Once again, if in theory the coin

00:00:51.509 --> 00:00:54.939
is definitely fair, it's a
fair coin and it's flipped

00:00:54.939 --> 00:00:57.401
in a very fair way, then this is true.

00:00:57.401 --> 00:01:01.615
You have a 1/2 probability.

00:01:01.615 --> 00:01:04.076
We could also do that with rolling a die.

00:01:04.076 --> 00:01:07.023
A fair six-sided die is
going to have six possible

00:01:07.023 --> 00:01:10.621
outcomes: one, two,
three, four, five and six.

00:01:10.621 --> 00:01:14.267
And if you said "what is
the probability of getting

00:01:14.267 --> 00:01:17.712
"a result that is greater
than or equal to three?"

00:01:17.712 --> 00:01:20.382
Well, we have six equally
likely possibilities.

00:01:20.382 --> 00:01:21.663
You see them there.

00:01:21.663 --> 00:01:24.610
In theory, if they're all equally likely,

00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:27.423
four of these possibilities
meet our constraint

00:01:27.423 --> 00:01:29.876
of being greater than or equal to three.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:32.279
We have four out of the six of these

00:01:32.279 --> 00:01:34.241
possibilities meet our constraints.

00:01:34.241 --> 00:01:36.914
So we have a 2/3, 4/6 is the same thing

00:01:36.914 --> 00:01:40.374
as 2/3, probability of it happening.

00:01:40.374 --> 00:01:41.525
Now these are for simple things,

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:45.334
like die or flipping a coin.

00:01:45.334 --> 00:01:47.272
And if you have fancy computers

00:01:47.272 --> 00:01:48.925
or spreadsheets you can even say "hey,

00:01:48.925 --> 00:01:50.377
"I'm gonna flip a coin a bunch of times

00:01:50.377 --> 00:01:52.687
"and do all the
combinatorics" and all that.

00:01:52.687 --> 00:01:54.138
But there are things that are even

00:01:54.138 --> 00:01:57.194
beyond what a computer can find

00:01:57.194 --> 00:01:59.243
the exact theoretical probability for.

00:01:59.243 --> 00:02:00.666
Let's say you are playing a game,

00:02:00.666 --> 00:02:03.074
say football, American football,

00:02:03.074 --> 00:02:04.454
and you wanted to figure
out the probability

00:02:04.454 --> 00:02:06.884
of scoring a certain number of points.

00:02:06.884 --> 00:02:09.332
Well that isn't very
simple because that's going

00:02:09.332 --> 00:02:12.251
to involve what human beings are doing.

00:02:12.251 --> 00:02:14.325
Minds are very unpredictable,

00:02:14.325 --> 00:02:15.950
how people will respond to things.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.983
The weather might get involved.

00:02:18.983 --> 00:02:20.334
Someone might fall sick.

00:02:20.334 --> 00:02:23.531
The ball might be wet,
or just how the ball

00:02:23.531 --> 00:02:25.945
might interact with some player's jersey.

00:02:25.945 --> 00:02:30.531
Who knows what might actually result

00:02:30.531 --> 00:02:34.303
in the score being one point this way,

00:02:34.303 --> 00:02:37.176
or seven points this way,
or seven points that way.

00:02:37.176 --> 00:02:39.832
So for situations like
that, it makes more sense

00:02:39.832 --> 00:02:42.897
to think more in terms of
experimental probability.

00:02:43.809 --> 00:02:46.467
In experimental probability,
we're really just trying

00:02:46.467 --> 00:02:48.721
to get an estimate of something happening,

00:02:48.721 --> 00:02:52.410
based on data and experience
that we've had in the past.

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:57.286
For example, let's say you had data from

00:02:57.286 --> 00:03:02.224
your football team and it's
many games into the season.

00:03:02.224 --> 00:03:04.126
You've been tabulating
the number of points,

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:06.424
you have a histogram
of the number of games

00:03:06.424 --> 00:03:08.153
that scored between zero and nine points.

00:03:08.153 --> 00:03:09.162
You had two games that scored

00:03:09.162 --> 00:03:10.660
between zero and nine points.

00:03:10.660 --> 00:03:15.660
Four games that scored
from ten to 19 points.

00:03:15.740 --> 00:03:18.594
You had five games that
went from 20 to 29 points.

00:03:18.594 --> 00:03:22.200
You had three games that
went from 30 to 39 points.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.475
Then you had two games that
go from 40 to 49 points.

00:03:25.475 --> 00:03:28.554
Now let's say for your
next game, let's see

00:03:28.554 --> 00:03:31.696
how many games you've had so far.

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:34.549
The game so far is two plus four

00:03:34.549 --> 00:03:37.874
plus five plus three plus two,

00:03:37.874 --> 00:03:42.390
so this is six, plus five is 11.

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:44.828
Eleven plus five is 16.

00:03:44.828 --> 00:03:47.216
So you've had 16 games so far this season

00:03:47.216 --> 00:03:49.898
and you're curious, for your 17th game,

00:03:53.439 --> 00:03:57.421
you want to figure out,
what is the probability

00:04:08.717 --> 00:04:12.828
your points are greater
than or equal to 30?

00:04:12.828 --> 00:04:13.834
The probability your
points are greater than

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:16.710
or equal to 30 for game 17.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:18.602
Once again, this is very hard to find

00:04:18.602 --> 00:04:20.680
the exact theoretical probability.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:23.530
You don't know exactly, you
can't predict the future.

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.795
You don't know who's gonna show up sick,

00:04:25.795 --> 00:04:27.837
how humans are going to
interact with each other.

00:04:27.837 --> 00:04:29.974
Maybe someone screams
something in the stand

00:04:29.974 --> 00:04:31.504
that just phases the quarterback

00:04:31.504 --> 00:04:33.443
in exactly the right or the wrong way.

00:04:33.443 --> 00:04:34.254
You don't know.

00:04:34.254 --> 00:04:36.004
This is an incredibly, incredibly complex

00:04:36.004 --> 00:04:37.555
system, what might happen over

00:04:37.555 --> 00:04:39.863
the course of an entire football game.

00:04:39.863 --> 00:04:41.661
But you can estimate what'll happen based

00:04:41.661 --> 00:04:43.594
on what you've seen in
your past experience.

00:04:43.594 --> 00:04:45.243
It depends on the defense of the team

00:04:45.243 --> 00:04:46.402
you're facing and all that.

00:04:46.402 --> 00:04:50.094
So it's not going to be super exact,

00:04:50.094 --> 00:04:52.361
but you could estimate,
based on experiments,

00:04:52.361 --> 00:04:54.204
based on what you've seen in the past.

00:04:54.204 --> 00:04:56.726
Here, the experimental probability,

00:04:56.726 --> 00:04:59.773
and I would say the estimate,

00:04:59.773 --> 00:05:03.407
because you shouldn't walk away saying,

00:05:03.407 --> 00:05:05.032
"okay, we absolutely know for sure

00:05:05.032 --> 00:05:07.324
"that if we conducted this next game

00:05:07.324 --> 00:05:08.998
"experiment n times that it's definitely

00:05:08.998 --> 00:05:09.725
"gonna turn out the same."

00:05:09.725 --> 00:05:11.706
Because this might be the toughest

00:05:11.706 --> 00:05:12.754
defense that you play all year, this might

00:05:12.754 --> 00:05:15.192
be the easiest defense
that you play all year.

00:05:15.192 --> 00:05:16.538
But if you look at what's happened

00:05:16.538 --> 00:05:20.431
in the past, out of the 16 games so far,

00:05:20.431 --> 00:05:23.949
there have been three games, these three

00:05:23.949 --> 00:05:27.448
plus these two games, where you scored

00:05:27.448 --> 00:05:30.190
greater than or equal to 30 points.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:33.255
So five out of the 16 situations,

00:05:33.255 --> 00:05:35.068
you've scored more than that.

00:05:35.068 --> 00:05:37.767
An estimate of your probability, you could

00:05:37.767 --> 00:05:40.286
view this as maybe your
experimental probability,

00:05:40.286 --> 00:05:42.603
of scoring more than
30 points based on past

00:05:42.603 --> 00:05:47.603
experience, based on
past experience, is five,

00:05:48.186 --> 00:05:51.640
five out of the 16 games
you've done this in the past.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:53.673
So you'd say it's 5/16.

00:05:53.673 --> 00:05:55.159
Now I want to really have you

00:05:55.159 --> 00:05:56.657
take this with a grain of salt.

00:05:56.657 --> 00:06:00.287
You should not say "okay, I know for sure

00:06:00.287 --> 00:06:03.470
"there's a 5/16 probability
of us winning this game."

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:04.813
Because you only have some data points,

00:06:04.813 --> 00:06:06.591
every team you play is
going to be different,

00:06:06.591 --> 00:06:08.006
it's going to be different
weather conditions,

00:06:08.006 --> 00:06:10.445
people are going to be in
different moods, etc., etc.

00:06:10.445 --> 00:06:13.305
This is really just an estimate.

00:06:13.305 --> 00:06:14.476
I feel a little bit of reservations

00:06:14.476 --> 00:06:16.056
even calling it a probability.

00:06:16.056 --> 00:06:18.158
I would just say that this has been true

00:06:18.158 --> 00:06:20.328
of five out of 16 games in the past.

00:06:20.328 --> 00:06:24.629
So it's an indicator of what might be.

00:06:24.629 --> 00:06:27.424
You might say, "okay, based
on experience, it's more

00:06:27.424 --> 00:06:31.382
"likely than not that we don't
score more than 30 points."

00:06:31.382 --> 00:06:34.446
But it's really just based
on experiential data,

00:06:34.446 --> 00:06:35.580
what's happened in the season.

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:36.666
Even the makeup of your football

00:06:36.666 --> 00:06:37.651
team might have changed.

00:06:37.651 --> 00:06:39.108
You might have gotten a different coach,

00:06:39.108 --> 00:06:40.843
you might have learned to train better.

00:06:40.843 --> 00:06:42.631
Who knows, one of your team members

00:06:42.631 --> 00:06:44.407
might have grown by three inches.

00:06:44.407 --> 00:06:45.175
All of these things.

00:06:45.175 --> 00:06:47.892
So all of this has to be
taken with a grain of salt.

00:06:47.892 --> 00:06:49.575
But this is one way of thinking about it.

00:06:49.575 --> 00:06:53.341
At least having a sense
of what may happen.
