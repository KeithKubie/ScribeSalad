1
00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:04,650
The Joe Rogan experience was the biggest
crowd you guys ever performed in front

2
00:00:04,651 --> 00:00:06,060
of him?
Um,

3
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,350
I think the biggest was with
Woodstock [inaudible] 94,

4
00:00:10,351 --> 00:00:15,351
I think it was 93 94 and that was like
300 and 380 some odd thousand pieces.

5
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:25,560
We've done some big ones like
small European country. We,

6
00:00:25,561 --> 00:00:29,070
we've done some like, you
know, like at a, you know,

7
00:00:29,071 --> 00:00:32,970
100,000 people in hundred 50.
Oh my God.

8
00:00:32,971 --> 00:00:35,040
I got to see this fucking

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:41,210
insane and that I had just cut my hair
right there. I was like, you know,

10
00:00:41,260 --> 00:00:46,170
whew. Oh my God. See the
little guy next to mugs.

11
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:51,330
He was our, our, our, our uh,
our miniature knockout guy.

12
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:56,200
He knew Jujitsu, taekwondo showed Oh Khan.
He trained with, with mum, Boy Kenji.

13
00:00:56,201 --> 00:01:00,760
And he was like, uh, he was like
our unofficial security. Oh,

14
00:01:00,761 --> 00:01:03,690
that's hilarious. Cause Unassuming,
right? Yeah, he's a little guy.

15
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:07,590
I mean he even did,
he even did a few MMA fights.

16
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:12,270
Look at that fucking crowd.
That is insane.

17
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,940
I almost lost my shit right
here because you know,

18
00:01:14,941 --> 00:01:19,941
seeing 300 and some odd thousand
people jumping around to your shit.

19
00:01:19,980 --> 00:01:24,930
God, you know, it could
give you some equilibrium
problems. I would have seen it.

20
00:01:25,210 --> 00:01:29,760
Cause it's the, it looks
like waves crashing into each
other when it's that big.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,690
I mean that's gotta be one of the biggest
concerts ever anybody's ever performed

22
00:01:33,691 --> 00:01:37,440
in front of, in North America for sure.
I mean in all of human history. Yeah.

23
00:01:37,441 --> 00:01:39,440
It was one of the biggest, how
the fuck do you mean? What,

24
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:44,220
how do you get it more than
380,000 people together? Yeah.

25
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:47,520
It's crazy. That's probably only
happened a few times. It's, it's crazy.

26
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:52,080
I mean every band they had on this,
this particular bill was huge at the time.

27
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:55,350
He knows so it was,
yeah it was,

28
00:01:55,351 --> 00:01:57,270
it was pretty crazy
trying to just get there.

29
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,670
We like some of us had
to get in through boats.

30
00:01:59,671 --> 00:02:02,490
Some of us had to get in
through helicopter. Why?

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:05,310
Cause there's too many good cause date.
They had started parking on the roads.

32
00:02:05,311 --> 00:02:09,420
Like the old school would stop and they
jammed up the highways and stuff like

33
00:02:09,421 --> 00:02:12,450
that. They parked, they
pretty much shut the shit down

34
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:17,260
and I went in through helicopter and some
of the other guys went into the bloke.

35
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,990
That's when you know you're on top of
the world flying into a show on a fucking

36
00:02:21,991 --> 00:02:23,030
helicopter and I'll tell you,

37
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,070
that's when you realize why you can never
get away from the cops when they're in

38
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:31,230
fucking see everything. Well,
that's a funny thing, man.

39
00:02:31,231 --> 00:02:33,780
When you watch those dudes that are trying
to escape from the cops on the ground

40
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,620
and then you watch the
cops in the helicopter in
spotlight just stays in the car

41
00:02:37,650 --> 00:02:41,240
the entire time. Yeah,
that's, yeah, that's,

42
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,940
and that's just a piece of it right there.
And they had a rotating stage.

43
00:02:45,900 --> 00:02:47,130
What are you doing?
You have to take a shit.

44
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:50,490
How long does it take to get
from the front row to the back?

45
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:51,540
I'll take a shit tell you.

46
00:02:51,541 --> 00:02:56,541
We walked around in that shit right there
and it was super muddy and crazy and

47
00:02:56,611 --> 00:03:00,700
people were like, but naked with
mud all over there. Fucking bodies.

48
00:03:01,300 --> 00:03:03,130
It was like people went primal.

49
00:03:04,090 --> 00:03:07,880
I swear to God there they go right
there and they were having mudslides.

50
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:12,730
Um Oh man, that looks awesome. People
made babies that day in their tent.

51
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,150
I'm sure they did. Oh for
sure they did. Yeah, sure.

52
00:03:16,151 --> 00:03:18,250
There's a lot of people out
there right now. It was, it was,

53
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:20,470
it was fucking crazy man. I
got to tell you, there was,

54
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:25,500
there was people out there totally
hippied out like straight up butt naked in

55
00:03:26,241 --> 00:03:28,750
the, you know, and there was a
good portion of them. I mean not,

56
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:32,350
not in terms of the whole concert,
I mean is a small percentage,

57
00:03:32,351 --> 00:03:36,640
but like you've seen just naked
people walking around free out there.

58
00:03:36,641 --> 00:03:41,050
It was crazy as fuck. We
like, we're like, are we,

59
00:03:41,051 --> 00:03:45,910
is this really happening?
Shit man in and then the mud was so thick,

60
00:03:45,911 --> 00:03:49,150
man. It was the type where like if you
walked through it with your shoes and your

61
00:03:49,151 --> 00:03:51,400
shoes weren't tight or
you weren't wearing boots,

62
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,920
it was sucking the shoe
right off of your foot.

63
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:57,730
It happened to me a number of times.
Hell in that show.

64
00:03:57,731 --> 00:04:02,290
I jumped into the crowd cause normally
I would jump into the crowd and uh,

65
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,440
you know, just be floating,
you know, stage dive style.

66
00:04:05,441 --> 00:04:08,810
But I would still be doing the song right.
And uh,

67
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,430
on that particular show they
took my shoes and socks.

68
00:04:13,570 --> 00:04:17,650
I got back on stage with no
shoes and socks. And you know,

69
00:04:17,651 --> 00:04:19,930
about 15 years later,
you know,

70
00:04:19,960 --> 00:04:24,960
I had one guy with once you come to
the show in flicking have me sign it.

71
00:04:25,060 --> 00:04:27,430
Oh.
And then the other shoe,

72
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:31,750
some or some chick had it and
had me sign it some years later.

73
00:04:31,751 --> 00:04:35,170
So I've caught up with both shoes,
didn't catch up with the sites,

74
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,210
didn't catch up to stocks to shoes
yet. Caught up with them. What,

75
00:04:41,260 --> 00:04:43,900
do they have a limited amount of
tickets for Woodstock? I mean,

76
00:04:43,901 --> 00:04:46,180
what the fuck did they do when
you get that many people I take,

77
00:04:46,181 --> 00:04:50,680
they probably started with the some
sort of limit and became Kay and then it

78
00:04:50,681 --> 00:04:53,560
became chaos. You know, like that
something they couldn't handle.

79
00:04:53,561 --> 00:04:57,580
I mean if you lived there, stretch it
to send that they want you to stuff. Oh,

80
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:01,300
I know they were pissed off. They had
a break for like fucking 25 years.

81
00:05:01,300 --> 00:05:04,690
They had a break.
They sold a 164,000 tickets,

82
00:05:04,691 --> 00:05:09,310
but the crowd estimated size was 550,000.
Okay, well shit, I was too short.

83
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:14,890
It's 200,000 short. Yeah. Yeah,
because the rest rush, the gate,

84
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:18,520
you know,
they took the fence and you know,

85
00:05:18,580 --> 00:05:23,340
to sit down and they just fucking rolled,
rolled on it. I would imagine that it,

86
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:26,200
you know, cause went into an event
that everybody wants to get to.

87
00:05:26,201 --> 00:05:30,290
They're going to find a way to it and
it's outside and it's outside and what

88
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:35,080
those numbers, man, that's, you can't
stop that. I'm now in it, you know, it's,

89
00:05:35,081 --> 00:05:37,780
it's a great part of their
history because I mean, you know,

90
00:05:37,810 --> 00:05:42,810
that one was a good one where no
one got hurt and there was no crazy,

91
00:05:43,691 --> 00:05:47,320
uh, no crazy shit happening. Like
the next one after that, I mean,

92
00:05:47,321 --> 00:05:52,120
they had some habitat x one. Ah,
well shit, they had a bunch of,

93
00:05:52,121 --> 00:05:56,680
uh, women say that they had gotten
raped or molested at, um, at,

94
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:00,920
at the one the following
year. Um, and, uh,

95
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,140
fires that shit at the end.
Yeah. And then there was fires.

96
00:06:03,141 --> 00:06:06,440
There was a whole bunch of people
lost their fucking mind, the one,

97
00:06:06,530 --> 00:06:11,390
and that's so great bands too. So, you
know, they don't do that anymore. Right.

98
00:06:11,420 --> 00:06:13,800
What stocks know that there's the summer,
they're doing it enough.

99
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:18,880
What are you doing? You fucking idiots.
Move. Sell your house. Yeah. Do something.

100
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:23,320
Do something. It's crazy though, because
there's a fire is holy shit man. Yeah.

101
00:06:23,330 --> 00:06:27,200
They had bonfires. Yeah. I believe
when little Ms. Good corn went on,

102
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:31,850
it was either limp Bizkit or corn
and the fires just fucking started.

103
00:06:31,851 --> 00:06:34,430
People were pissed because they were
charging so much for water and like,

104
00:06:34,431 --> 00:06:37,190
they couldn't, they couldn't get to the
bathrooms like you're asking like theirs,

105
00:06:37,220 --> 00:06:39,590
they didn't have the facilities
set up as well or yeah.

106
00:06:39,590 --> 00:06:43,860
They didn't have adequate facilities for
what, what the fuck was popping to me.

107
00:06:43,861 --> 00:06:46,550
And you know, uh, you
know, a spouse is Christ.

108
00:06:46,551 --> 00:06:49,220
Look at the fucking what it looks
like after it's over. Listen,

109
00:06:49,221 --> 00:06:53,230
a thousand Andy gumps for
500,000 people is nothing

110
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:56,720
you imagined you need like 10,000.

111
00:06:56,990 --> 00:07:00,500
He could imagine being the dude
who gets in there after 5,000.

112
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:01,700
I mean look at taking a shit.

113
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,290
They totally took over the fucking the
highway rat racey they shut down the

114
00:07:06,291 --> 00:07:10,130
fucking highway. They just parked their
cars. Yeah, they made the highway.

115
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:13,940
The parking is crazy. Look at that.
At least it was kind of orderly.

116
00:07:14,370 --> 00:07:18,200
Like maybe they sort of sort of, they
shut down. I'll tell you this though.

117
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:21,710
They weren't cold blooded. Um,
the, the organizers because

118
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:24,900
that is so crazy.

119
00:07:27,190 --> 00:07:30,560
These guys had some fucking Moxy, I'll
tell you that. Hey listen, you know,

120
00:07:30,561 --> 00:07:33,290
after every band was done with their set,

121
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:37,760
they expected you to leave right away
because the next wave of bands was coming

122
00:07:38,210 --> 00:07:42,200
and they were getting your spot.
So like if you had a dressing room,

123
00:07:42,260 --> 00:07:45,620
once you're set was done,
you were expected to get the fuck out.

124
00:07:45,770 --> 00:07:49,970
So you've got a helicopter out of there.
If, if, yeah, it was best if you did,

125
00:07:49,971 --> 00:07:53,620
because if you didn't take the ride
when, when, when you were supposed to,

126
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:55,160
you were getting stuck there,

127
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:59,540
they couldn't guarantee that they could
give you the ride back to your shit

128
00:07:59,690 --> 00:08:00,650
after that,
you know,

129
00:08:00,651 --> 00:08:04,370
because they had all the other bands to
think of and they might not have room

130
00:08:04,371 --> 00:08:07,940
for you when they take the other
bands. So it was like, yeah,

131
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:13,150
that fucking fish. Oh
my God. Yup. Oh my God.

132
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:15,910
Yes. That's what we look at.
It looks like Caitlyn, Mike,

133
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:20,540
it's like PAC man fucking eating
the stage. Right. That's insane.

134
00:08:20,541 --> 00:08:23,880
That picture is insane.
Yeah, it was. That's, that's,

135
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:27,770
that's the one I'll remember the most. I
mean, we've, we've done some huge gigs,

136
00:08:27,771 --> 00:08:29,930
but like that one by far,
you know,

137
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:34,640
never have we played for another 500,000,
you know,

138
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,950
sound like 500,000 people screaming
much like that Viking chant.

139
00:08:43,480 --> 00:08:43,820
I mean,

140
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,770
we had a small nation right there with
crazy legitimately like when you leave

141
00:08:48,771 --> 00:08:52,760
there and then you go do a regular
gig afterwards. Does it feel weird?

142
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,710
He, uh, well it depends,
but yeah, adjusting.

143
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,120
It does take some adjusting,
you know,

144
00:09:00,121 --> 00:09:03,600
especially if the next Gig is in
his hype is that you're like, fuck,

145
00:09:03,601 --> 00:09:04,740
we just came from Woodstock.

146
00:09:06,030 --> 00:09:10,980
But fortunately the smaller
gigs that we had after that,

147
00:09:11,100 --> 00:09:13,740
you know, in terms of planning
festivals, they were like, you know,

148
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:17,220
in between 30,000 and seventy
thousand one hundred thousand.

149
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:22,280
And we felt that that gave us such an
experience that we can handle any fucking

150
00:09:22,651 --> 00:09:27,510
stage. So it became easier for
us to do festivals after that.

151
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:32,850
And the reaction that we would get at
these festivals were smaller versions of

152
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:36,300
what we did there, you
know? And uh, it was,

153
00:09:36,301 --> 00:09:39,190
it was a great experience because we had,
we had been doing like a,

154
00:09:39,191 --> 00:09:41,430
a couple of European
festivals before that,

155
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,290
so it sort of prepared us for
that. But we didn't, we didn't,

156
00:09:46,830 --> 00:09:50,940
I mean, the fucking numbers we were
definitely not prepared for. We were like,

157
00:09:50,941 --> 00:09:55,350
Whoa, what the fuck? That's like that
transcends reality. Yeah. I mean,

158
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,630
listen, we know that that's not our show.
They're not all there for us, you know,

159
00:10:00,631 --> 00:10:02,130
cause it's a mixed bag,
right?

160
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:06,810
A bunch of different artists and you're
winning over people. If anything you're,

161
00:10:06,820 --> 00:10:09,060
you're, you're, you're there
playing for your, your,

162
00:10:09,061 --> 00:10:11,220
your base of people that
might've come to see you,

163
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:15,990
but you're winning everybody else over
if you're doing it right. And, uh,

164
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:20,430
for us it was like a, a victory
because we saw, you know,

165
00:10:20,550 --> 00:10:24,090
half a million people up there jumping
up and down the all our shit and they

166
00:10:24,091 --> 00:10:28,650
knew the words and they were singing
with us and it, you know, it was like a,

167
00:10:29,190 --> 00:10:32,160
a big notch under the belt in
a boost for our confidence,

168
00:10:32,161 --> 00:10:34,110
knowing that we can get
in front of anybody,

169
00:10:34,111 --> 00:10:38,520
play with anyone and get that reaction.
I mean,

170
00:10:38,521 --> 00:10:41,580
because after that, you know, we
were getting booked on metal, um,

171
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:45,600
driven festivals and stuff.
Where were the only hip hop on it,

172
00:10:45,720 --> 00:10:49,500
but it's all straight up metal.
I mean we were playing shows, um,

173
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:55,020
co headlining under Metallica,
right? Metallica, Cypress Hill,

174
00:10:55,530 --> 00:11:00,060
um, uh, biohazard, def
tones, fear factory in,

175
00:11:00,061 --> 00:11:03,180
in all of that stuff. You know what
I mean? And we'd be in that mix,

176
00:11:03,181 --> 00:11:08,181
playing those festivals with those guys
and with hip hop music and you know,

177
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,360
the boost did, it gave us in
the confidence, it was like,

178
00:11:12,361 --> 00:11:14,640
fuck that we can play with
any of these motherfuckers.

179
00:11:14,641 --> 00:11:16,080
It doesn't matter who it is.
And,

180
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:21,030
and we went to those metal fest metal
festivals with our hip hop and got metal

181
00:11:21,031 --> 00:11:24,930
reaction, mosh pits, stage dives,

182
00:11:24,931 --> 00:11:26,580
everything what you know,
and,

183
00:11:26,581 --> 00:11:31,200
and it felt good to be able to hang
up there with Metallica. I mean, yeah,

184
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:34,980
what they do to a crowd is crazy.

185
00:11:35,730 --> 00:11:39,270
But we realized that if we were playing
on the same venue going before them,

186
00:11:39,570 --> 00:11:44,550
we can in a festival form,
we can fucking hang with anyone.

187
00:11:44,551 --> 00:11:46,110
And, and uh, that's,

188
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:50,350
that pretty much put us over the top
with doing festivals. Like, yeah,

189
00:11:50,570 --> 00:11:53,290
we're going to fucking rule this shit.
People are going to have to,

190
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:57,130
people are going to have to up their game
when we're on that festival with them.

191
00:11:57,131 --> 00:11:58,150
That's the way we took it.

192
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,000
And I would imagine you couldn't
sleep for days after that chair.

193
00:12:01,150 --> 00:12:03,640
The adrenaline was crazy.
I got to tell you,

194
00:12:03,641 --> 00:12:06,470
the adrenaline was crazy and then
you're in the helicopter leaving.

195
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:09,910
Will you like what the fuck does happen?
Yeah, we were, we were tripping out man.

196
00:12:09,911 --> 00:12:12,820
I mean,
we were like totally in awe of,

197
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:17,710
of the response that we got
and the, the, the, you know,

198
00:12:17,711 --> 00:12:21,740
the enormity of the fucking crowd,
man. I mean it was fucking huge.

199
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:23,890
Is to be a part of something.
That's that, I mean,

200
00:12:23,891 --> 00:12:26,620
that's like something that no
one there is ever gonna Forget.

201
00:12:26,650 --> 00:12:29,870
We took it for granted. I've got to
tell you when we fucking, they'll, well,

202
00:12:29,890 --> 00:12:33,670
they want you to do well. Okay. We'll do
Woodstock, whatever. And, and, and uh,

203
00:12:34,330 --> 00:12:38,560
when we got there, that's when we
saw just how fucking crazy it was.

204
00:12:38,561 --> 00:12:41,950
I think this is yet, see, oh, this is
you. So they steal your shoes. Yeah,

205
00:12:41,951 --> 00:12:44,400
they're good. Yeah, they're good. They're
going to start coming. Watch that.

206
00:12:44,650 --> 00:12:47,830
I have to hold my shirt forward
so they don't get choked out.

207
00:12:48,580 --> 00:12:51,620
And there goes,
there goes the first shoes.

208
00:12:52,900 --> 00:12:55,000
Take that first one. Yeah. Ridiculous.

209
00:12:55,180 --> 00:12:58,480
What were you thinking when
they were taking shit? Like,
Damn. I was like, Oh fuck.

210
00:12:58,481 --> 00:13:03,130
There goes once you there
goes on white sock. Yeah.

211
00:13:03,131 --> 00:13:05,830
That goes the other so ridiculous.

212
00:13:05,831 --> 00:13:10,831
And there is no fucking security that
can stop 500,000 people and save all that

213
00:13:11,771 --> 00:13:12,604
shit.
No,

214
00:13:12,610 --> 00:13:17,580
you're at the mercy of the fans but he's
going to grab from my sock pretty soon.

215
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,520
That is so wild. And is stealing socks.
Look at it. It's still your parents.

216
00:13:22,030 --> 00:13:26,530
Hey listen, you know they, they,
they tried in big grabby Dick. No.

217
00:13:26,531 --> 00:13:31,270
You know, they tried to grab the weed
in my pocket. Ah. Is that sometimes,

218
00:13:31,271 --> 00:13:34,480
you know, when your adrenaline is
kicking you're not really thinking,

219
00:13:34,540 --> 00:13:37,870
you know what's in my pocket and
shit like that. But yeah. You know,

220
00:13:37,930 --> 00:13:42,760
throughout the, I had chicks
trying to grab my shit for
sure. Of course. The, sure.

221
00:13:42,790 --> 00:13:47,410
Yeah. That was a little, you know, crazy
for me, you know? But it is what it is.

222
00:13:47,411 --> 00:13:52,230
If you're going to stand close. Yeah. You
know, Shit like this happens, right? Yeah,

223
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:52,731
man.
I mean if,

224
00:13:52,731 --> 00:13:56,140
if you're going to stage dive you got
to assume some weird shit is going to

225
00:13:56,141 --> 00:14:00,280
happen. Yeah. I mean for me, you know,
people were mostly respectful, you know,

226
00:14:00,281 --> 00:14:05,080
but they would go through my pockets to
see if I had weed in one gravity or your

227
00:14:05,081 --> 00:14:06,580
pockets out. Yeah, I did. I had some,

228
00:14:06,730 --> 00:14:10,450
I had like an ounce of weed in one at
one show and I jumped in and I totally

229
00:14:10,451 --> 00:14:13,730
forgot I had it in my pocket.
Boom. If I can took my Goddamn, we

230
00:14:15,340 --> 00:14:19,690
hope you enjoyed that. I bet
they did. Actually. They did
their role in that joint.

231
00:14:19,691 --> 00:14:23,800
This is be real weed, man. I know
they do train from California.

232
00:14:23,801 --> 00:14:25,030
This is the real shit.
