00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:04.450
LUIS ALVAREZ &gt;&gt; Well, my personal view is
that 2009 is going to remain to be a very

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:09.880
difficult year for all of us. I think the
challenge is to identify which areas will

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:17.750
be of growth in terms of-ah-making our community,
our society growing faster in some areas:

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:24.420
providing better services, ______ in education,
health or-or development. And trying to find

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:29.289
out also how that could drive the growth of
the rest. But I think that we will face a

00:00:29.289 --> 00:00:35.300
very, very bad 2009 although it is possibly
the new basement for the growth in the coming

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:35.620
years.
