1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:03,630
Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Robert
Krulwich. This is radio lab,

2
00:00:03,660 --> 00:00:08,040
the podcast podcast. And in
this podcast I have learned, no,

3
00:00:08,041 --> 00:00:09,960
how would you describe
this one? My sense is that

4
00:00:10,370 --> 00:00:15,370
you walk into a wild place and you hear
the wind and the trees and you hear

5
00:00:15,561 --> 00:00:19,700
these trips and sounds and calls
and they're just part of the,

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,670
they're part of the
wild. They're wild life.

7
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:28,300
But there's now a group of scientists
who listen much more closely and who are

8
00:00:28,311 --> 00:00:32,750
reducing wildlife to wild
talk. It's, it's a, yeah,

9
00:00:33,110 --> 00:00:34,430
there are words in there.

10
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:38,930
When you find the words as the people
we will meet do in these stories,

11
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:40,760
you end up not just understanding,

12
00:00:40,761 --> 00:00:43,940
but actually entering that
wild space in a very cool way.

13
00:00:44,060 --> 00:00:47,420
So we're going to tell you two
tales here, two different places.

14
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:51,440
The first a jungle and the
second a prairie right.

15
00:00:51,650 --> 00:00:55,190
Jungle gets it started and then the
prairie and later, uh, this is a story,

16
00:00:55,191 --> 00:00:58,580
this first one that we heard
about. Yeah. Yeah. I am from Ari.

17
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,360
I'm Ra Daniel Shapiro. I'm a
public radio producer in Boston.

18
00:01:02,840 --> 00:01:07,190
The Ra recently met a guy, I think a
German. Yes. He's Swiss. No. Okay. Yeah.

19
00:01:07,191 --> 00:01:08,540
His name is Klaus Zuber,

20
00:01:08,541 --> 00:01:13,440
Buhler close and he's a professor of
psychology at University of Saint Andrews,

21
00:01:13,460 --> 00:01:16,070
which is in Scotland. And where
does this story actually take place?

22
00:01:16,071 --> 00:01:18,030
Because where's the
jungle? Yeah, well I, I'm,

23
00:01:18,070 --> 00:01:22,880
I maybe the best place to start is to
kind of describe the scene where we are,

24
00:01:23,180 --> 00:01:28,010
which is in the Thai forest forest,
which is in the Ivory Coast in Africa.

25
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:32,780
So it's not in Thailand. No, it's
not. It's t a I, he a I. Okay. Yeah.

26
00:01:32,840 --> 00:01:37,840
And Klaus describes the jungle
as this thick sensory world.

27
00:01:38,300 --> 00:01:41,780
Very dark, very moist
and very, very green.

28
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:46,250
And you can't really see
for more than 15 to 20 feet.

29
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:50,300
And I mean sometimes you feel
like you walk through, you know,

30
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:55,380
the big cathedral of dark trees and
you don't see very much because all the

31
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:59,570
animals obviously very
shy and runaway Emmy.

32
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,490
Is it still a no, it's, it is,

33
00:02:04,491 --> 00:02:06,290
it is very, very noisy.

34
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:15,270
It's just this kind of sonic fails all
these insects and birds who bat sea

35
00:02:16,960 --> 00:02:17,793
mammals.

36
00:02:18,850 --> 00:02:22,090
It's almost as if they
compete for acoustic space.

37
00:02:24,960 --> 00:02:27,610
So it is very, very loud. I mean,

38
00:02:27,740 --> 00:02:30,960
th th the main sensation you have in
the beginning really is that you're,

39
00:02:30,961 --> 00:02:33,370
you're just completely lost.

40
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:39,130
So it's 1991 all right. And B
figured he had to start somewhere.

41
00:02:39,160 --> 00:02:42,850
So he focuses attention on a kind
of monkey, very beautiful monkey,

42
00:02:42,890 --> 00:02:47,560
a thing called the Diana monkey. This
mix of black, white and sort of reddish.

43
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,050
Diana monkeys live up in the tree tops,

44
00:02:50,230 --> 00:02:53,410
which can be as high as a
hundred feet off the ground. Wow.

45
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,290
They eat fruits and they eat
insects and they're chattering.

46
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,190
Hello. Good coffin. Any of

47
00:03:00,740 --> 00:03:05,590
calls, which to him,

48
00:03:05,591 --> 00:03:09,370
of course, you know, as a newcomer
to the forest was all just noise.

49
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:14,110
There's a little bit, I imagine like
a child trying to learn a language,

50
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:19,111
which initially most just sound like a
stream of sounds that you can't really

51
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:22,120
understand. And then you know
what? So what did he do? Well,

52
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:26,050
he started provoking the monkeys into
making different kinds of noises.

53
00:03:26,590 --> 00:03:31,140
For instance, he'd walk out into the
forest with a boombox speaker and play

54
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:33,230
[inaudible]

55
00:03:33,230 --> 00:03:37,320
it sound of the Diana monkeys
most feared Predator. The leper.

56
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,850
He would just play the
sound into the trees. Yep.

57
00:03:40,150 --> 00:03:43,500
Well all of a sudden suddenly he
started leaping around the branches.

58
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:47,940
You all who's hopping around motion
and they make this one particular call.

59
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:58,380
Ah, you these very loud
alarm calls. Yes ma'am.

60
00:04:00,490 --> 00:04:00,620
Ah,

61
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:01,880
meaning what? Yeah.

62
00:04:01,910 --> 00:04:05,120
Are they just saying like run or is
it something more specific? Well,

63
00:04:05,180 --> 00:04:07,700
here's where it gets a little
bit more interesting. Next step.

64
00:04:07,940 --> 00:04:11,000
He brought that same cassette player
out, pointed as the trees hit, play,

65
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:13,040
all that. Yep. But this time he plays

66
00:04:14,670 --> 00:04:18,210
the shrieks or for Crown Eagle
Eagles eat monkeys. Yeah,

67
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:21,420
they do tack from a bowl. I've heard
about them. They're very scary.

68
00:04:21,421 --> 00:04:23,610
They come flying in with
their talons. Are there

69
00:04:24,010 --> 00:04:28,520
beaks and they hit you in the head sharply
and kill you instantly and then you

70
00:04:28,521 --> 00:04:31,790
fall to the ground. Yeah. And so what
are the monkeys do when they hear this?

71
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:32,753
They make

72
00:04:34,820 --> 00:04:35,140
ah,

73
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:37,900
that sound. Same One. Well,
that's what he thought.

74
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:41,140
But when he went back to the lab and
started looking at the sounds on the

75
00:04:41,141 --> 00:04:43,630
computer comparing one to the other Eagle,

76
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:47,400
Huh? A Leopard Eagle,

77
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:50,890
a leper, he realized

78
00:04:52,570 --> 00:04:52,840
woo

79
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:55,630
that they're actually slightly different

80
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:59,280
in the acoustic details of the calls.

81
00:04:59,490 --> 00:05:03,540
And it's something that is very
difficult to hear when you're,

82
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:06,450
you really only see it in the spectrogram,

83
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:10,170
which is kind of a visual representation
of dis calls. This is on the computer.

84
00:05:10,420 --> 00:05:10,550
Yeah.

85
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:15,330
But interestingly once you've seen that
and once you know what to pay attention

86
00:05:15,331 --> 00:05:19,080
to, you go out into the forest and
suddenly you do hear these differences,

87
00:05:19,081 --> 00:05:20,070
which you hadn't heard before.

88
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:23,290
Mm.

89
00:05:23,290 --> 00:05:26,980
So you're saying when they hear, oh call
leopard coming, they go up the tree.

90
00:05:26,981 --> 00:05:31,390
But when they hear eagle coming, they
run down the tree. Exactly. Exactly.

91
00:05:31,510 --> 00:05:34,900
So it's really kind of like, oh
word. They, they like a word. No,

92
00:05:34,901 --> 00:05:36,640
that's kind of amazing.
Let's pull up for a second,

93
00:05:36,641 --> 00:05:38,410
cause this guy actually
got us thinking honestly,

94
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:43,210
how much language actually is out
there in the wild. What do we know?

95
00:05:43,211 --> 00:05:43,900
What's the state of [inaudible] state

96
00:05:43,900 --> 00:05:46,960
of what we know right
now. And that question,

97
00:05:47,470 --> 00:05:50,260
let us out of the forest
just for a second.

98
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:55,120
And to a place in a creature we just
didn't think would be a part of this

99
00:05:55,121 --> 00:05:58,160
conversation at all. Um, that creature is

100
00:05:59,090 --> 00:06:03,650
the [inaudible] prairie dog woo.
Reverie dogs. So here's the thing.

101
00:06:03,651 --> 00:06:06,350
Prairie dogs are these
little rodent like animals.

102
00:06:06,351 --> 00:06:11,351
They live under the ground in burrows
and when their community is invaded,

103
00:06:11,740 --> 00:06:14,000
they, you know, pop out of the
brewery, right? And they do, Oh,

104
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:17,750
here comes the whatever
sounds kind of like

105
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:21,940
g, G, G, G, g.

106
00:06:21,941 --> 00:06:23,260
G. G. G.

107
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:27,200
So we spoke with this guy. Um,
my name is constable Chekhov,

108
00:06:27,230 --> 00:06:32,000
professor emeritus at northern Arizona
University who spent a whole lot of time

109
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:34,940
sitting out in the colonies
according prairie dog calls.

110
00:06:34,941 --> 00:06:38,870
And he now believes that these simple
little rodents are like nature's

111
00:06:38,871 --> 00:06:43,460
wordsmith. Well, the thing is that
initially I recorded, for instance,

112
00:06:43,461 --> 00:06:47,630
he began by telling us that the prairie
dogs have different kinds of cheese for

113
00:06:47,631 --> 00:06:50,960
different kinds of predators.
For example, humans,

114
00:06:50,990 --> 00:06:53,540
coyotes and docks, right?

115
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:56,150
Is this the kind of thing that we would
actually be able to hear the difference

116
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:59,030
between the calls? I'm guessing
that you could hear the difference.

117
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:02,180
You want to try it? Chat? Yeah. Sorry.
Could you just play those samples?

118
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,800
All right. So here, here's one.

119
00:07:04,370 --> 00:07:06,610
Yes sir.

120
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:08,150
This is it. Another one.

121
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:09,813
Okay.

122
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,400
All right. Hey, here we go. This is it.

123
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,633
Third,

124
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:21,230
those represent different
predators. Yup. I don't,

125
00:07:21,290 --> 00:07:24,180
I can't tell the difference. Can you,
I mean, do you know what they are?

126
00:07:24,450 --> 00:07:29,010
My guess is human dog.
Coyote Khan was right.

127
00:07:29,830 --> 00:07:33,910
Columbus ride. Wow. Well,

128
00:07:33,911 --> 00:07:36,390
naturally we wondered
how, how'd he do that?

129
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:38,560
He told us that at first
just like you and I,

130
00:07:38,561 --> 00:07:41,110
he couldn't figure out how to
distinguish between these sounds,

131
00:07:41,111 --> 00:07:46,111
but he took the sound back to the lab
where we had a machine that allowed us to

132
00:07:46,181 --> 00:07:50,830
measure a series of, uh, frequency
and time elements in the call.

133
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:55,180
And what this computer does is it takes
the sound that the prairie dogs make and

134
00:07:55,181 --> 00:08:00,090
it essentially looks inside for the
ingredients inside the sound. Yeah.

135
00:08:00,091 --> 00:08:04,230
Like, uh, well it's Kinda hard to hear
with the Chirp because it's just hard.

136
00:08:04,231 --> 00:08:08,160
So let, let me demonstrate
crudely with this other sound.

137
00:08:08,310 --> 00:08:12,840
I plucked this at random from my library.
So this is kind of like a buzz. Okay.

138
00:08:13,050 --> 00:08:16,140
Okay. Let me just loop it
so we can hear it better.

139
00:08:17,730 --> 00:08:21,990
So here you've got this buzz, which is
sounds to us like a solid piece of noise,

140
00:08:21,991 --> 00:08:24,960
but getting the cue and
take away all the highs.

141
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:28,320
So now you've got just the base. Yep.

142
00:08:29,040 --> 00:08:32,430
Now you'll notice that if you add
the highest back in real slowly,

143
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:37,080
these little hidden overtones
will pop out like a, here's one.

144
00:08:37,530 --> 00:08:38,970
Yep. There's another

145
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:43,080
third, fourth.

146
00:08:45,950 --> 00:08:46,551
So in other words,

147
00:08:46,551 --> 00:08:50,960
this sound is filled with a little
ghost notes that we can't hear.

148
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:53,000
And certainly the same
is true of this sound.

149
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:54,733
Sure.

150
00:08:54,810 --> 00:08:56,100
Except in the case of the prairie dogs,

151
00:08:56,101 --> 00:08:59,880
it seems their ears are tuned to hear
all the different sounds within the

152
00:08:59,881 --> 00:09:00,690
church.

153
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:05,690
Probably sounds to them like this whole
layer cake of tones and calms computer.

154
00:09:05,821 --> 00:09:09,210
Notice the noise they made when a
human walked through their village was

155
00:09:09,211 --> 00:09:12,420
different in tone from
the noise they made.

156
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:14,340
When a coyote walked through
their village, it was,

157
00:09:14,360 --> 00:09:19,320
it was consistently different, but there
was a problem when he zoomed in on the,

158
00:09:19,350 --> 00:09:23,070
Oh, here come the human
calls, you look here,

159
00:09:23,850 --> 00:09:25,200
and he looked at them really closely.

160
00:09:25,201 --> 00:09:27,930
He saw that from one
human call to the next.

161
00:09:28,230 --> 00:09:30,570
There was a lot of subtle variation, much,

162
00:09:30,571 --> 00:09:34,470
much more than I would expect and
that's when it hit him. What if,

163
00:09:34,530 --> 00:09:37,050
what if, what if?

164
00:09:37,051 --> 00:09:40,770
What if they could be describing
the individual humans? Oh,

165
00:09:40,890 --> 00:09:42,180
now at that time,

166
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,040
no one suspected that this might even
be a possibility, but I thought, well,

167
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,200
let's try it and see what happens.

168
00:09:49,230 --> 00:09:53,790
So Khan recruited for humans and
he had them dress exactly the same.

169
00:09:53,791 --> 00:09:56,010
Same boots, same blue
jeans, same sunglasses,

170
00:09:56,011 --> 00:09:58,560
everything the same except
the color of their shirts.

171
00:09:58,590 --> 00:10:02,700
We had a person in a blue tee
shirt person in green tee shirt,

172
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,430
person in a yellow shirt
person in a gray shirt.

173
00:10:05,520 --> 00:10:09,930
Then he asked each of them to walk
through the prairie dog village one by one

174
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:15,900
sprayer downs made their chips.
And when we analyze the results,

175
00:10:15,960 --> 00:10:17,760
there were significant differences.

176
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:21,180
Like what kind they essentially
clustered around the colors.

177
00:10:23,100 --> 00:10:27,900
Does that mean you think you can hear
them saying, here comes the human in blue,

178
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:32,340
right? Versus here comes the human
in yellow, right? Really? Oh,

179
00:10:32,341 --> 00:10:36,300
I was astounded. I was astounded. I was
like, oh, wait a second. These humans,

180
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,580
they're not just different
in their shirt colors there.

181
00:10:39,100 --> 00:10:41,730
They're different than all kinds of
ways. Some of the humans were taller,

182
00:10:41,731 --> 00:10:43,290
some of the humans were shorter.

183
00:10:43,370 --> 00:10:47,430
So we went back reanalyzed the chirps
looked a little more closely and he

184
00:10:47,431 --> 00:10:52,350
realized he could tease out to the prairie
dogs were also commenting about the,

185
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,090
uh, general size of the human.
Essentially. They were saying,

186
00:10:57,210 --> 00:11:02,210
here comes the tall human in the blue
versus here comes the short human in the

187
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:07,920
yellow. Wow. And then he made another
leap and it was just, you know,

188
00:11:07,921 --> 00:11:11,880
since he was on a roll, um,
off the wall idea at that time,

189
00:11:12,150 --> 00:11:17,150
he went back into the prairie dog field
and he built two large wooden boxes

190
00:11:17,341 --> 00:11:21,330
sitting on stilts, a good distance
from each other, 150 feet.

191
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,140
And we strung wires
between the two towers.

192
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:30,030
His team then made cardboard
cutouts of three different shapes,

193
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,470
a circle, a square and a triangle. And
then they ran them out along the wire,

194
00:11:34,471 --> 00:11:37,290
kind of like laundry fluttering
above you in the breeze.

195
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:42,380
Each shape would emerge from one of
the tower blinds and fly something like

196
00:11:46,081 --> 00:11:49,620
about three feet over the
prairie dog town. Literally,

197
00:11:49,621 --> 00:11:54,550
you would just kind of go and out would
come a triangle or a circle or square.

198
00:11:54,910 --> 00:11:55,330
Correct.

199
00:11:55,330 --> 00:12:00,330
And what we found was that the prairie
dogs could tell the triangle from the

200
00:12:00,551 --> 00:12:02,080
circle very easily,

201
00:12:02,650 --> 00:12:07,090
but they could not seem to tell the
difference between a square in a circle.

202
00:12:07,300 --> 00:12:09,550
Huh? Why not? Well,

203
00:12:09,700 --> 00:12:14,020
my guess is that triangles
kind of look like Cox,

204
00:12:14,080 --> 00:12:14,913
mm.

205
00:12:14,980 --> 00:12:19,720
Circles and squares kind of
look like terrestrial predators.

206
00:12:19,900 --> 00:12:20,381
Nonetheless.

207
00:12:20,381 --> 00:12:24,910
What you've got here is a little Roden
with the remarkably big vocabulary,

208
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:29,400
including the probably not limited to
short fat, skinny, tall, blue, green,

209
00:12:29,401 --> 00:12:32,340
yellow, gray, coyote, human hoc
triangle. Enter a square, Yay.

210
00:12:33,030 --> 00:12:37,140
Not Bad is the next step that you're
going to perform a scene from the winter's

211
00:12:37,141 --> 00:12:41,040
tale and see whether the Perry
lugs laugh at the right moments.

212
00:12:41,250 --> 00:12:43,050
What do you do next? Well,

213
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:47,340
we just are scratching the
surface of looking at this.

214
00:12:47,490 --> 00:12:50,730
For example, prairie
dogs have a lot of calls,

215
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:52,740
which we call social chatters.

216
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,600
One prairie dog will be feeding and
suddenly lift up its head and go,

217
00:12:57,601 --> 00:13:00,510
chitter chatter, Chitter,
Chitter, and another prairie dog.

218
00:13:00,511 --> 00:13:04,200
Somewhere across the colony will lift
up its head and go, chatter, chatter,

219
00:13:04,201 --> 00:13:07,890
Chitter, chitter. But what does it
mean? We have no way of getting at it.

220
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,030
It could be just simply chatter,
tutor, tutor, or it could be,

221
00:13:12,031 --> 00:13:13,560
do you know where Sam was last night?

222
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:22,550
Now here's an interesting
question. I mean,

223
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,960
if a French couple was sitting next to
me on the subway and they was saying,

224
00:13:26,990 --> 00:13:31,040
do you know where Sam was last night
in French? If I don't speak French,

225
00:13:31,041 --> 00:13:32,510
I'm outside of that conversation.

226
00:13:32,511 --> 00:13:36,350
But a lot of people do speak French
and they can listen to French people

227
00:13:36,351 --> 00:13:37,880
talking. The questions then rays.

228
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:42,800
If you live in the forest and you speak
chimp or you speak eagle or you speak

229
00:13:42,801 --> 00:13:43,634
snake,

230
00:13:43,640 --> 00:13:48,640
would you ever be able to overhear or
learn something from a neighborly species?

231
00:13:48,681 --> 00:13:49,430
In other words,

232
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:54,430
is there an equivalent of listening to
the other person talking French in the

233
00:13:54,441 --> 00:13:58,580
wild? Hmm, good question. And that brings
us back to Klaus. You remember class?

234
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:03,070
The monkey guy? Yeah, the monkey guy.
Well, Klaus was wondering the same thing,

235
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:06,010
and that's a Ari Daniel Shapiro
again, who introduced us to class.

236
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:07,780
So take those alarm calls, for instance.

237
00:14:07,781 --> 00:14:11,770
He wanted to know whether different
species of monkeys could understand each

238
00:14:11,771 --> 00:14:13,180
other. So, um,

239
00:14:13,240 --> 00:14:18,100
and luckily for class there's like at
least 10 different primate species living

240
00:14:18,101 --> 00:14:19,630
inside that Thai forest.

241
00:14:19,660 --> 00:14:24,660
So there's one Calibus monkey two
[inaudible] three chimpanzees,

242
00:14:25,150 --> 00:14:29,710
four oligos Holbein six, Heidi knows
monkeys, seven mangabey species,

243
00:14:29,770 --> 00:14:34,360
Prosimians temples, monkey, and then
the Diana's 10. Yeah. So it's very,

244
00:14:34,750 --> 00:14:37,870
they rich prime at foreigner.
So Klaus's question was,

245
00:14:37,930 --> 00:14:42,160
could Diana monkeys understand the alarm
calls of another one of these monkeys?

246
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:46,060
The Campbell's monkey. Oh, could they
go across monkey lines so to speak?

247
00:14:46,270 --> 00:14:49,480
Exactly. So he used that
same setup from before,

248
00:14:49,580 --> 00:14:52,160
the speaker thing where he
plays the, into the trees. Yeah.

249
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:55,310
Any played the eagle and leopard
alarm calls from the Campbell's money

250
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,080
keys to the Diana's to
see if they'd react.

251
00:14:58,140 --> 00:15:02,160
And what we found thorough to our great
surprise was that the diner monkeys,

252
00:15:02,410 --> 00:15:06,790
they understand it really,
really. Yep. Picked it very,

253
00:15:06,791 --> 00:15:08,650
very seriously and
respond to very strongly.

254
00:15:08,651 --> 00:15:13,300
So a Dianna monkey hearing a Campbell's
eagle alarm call will respond as though

255
00:15:13,420 --> 00:15:16,390
there were an eagle and we'll respond to
the leopard alarm call as though there

256
00:15:16,391 --> 00:15:19,570
were a leopard and vice versa.
And it doesn't stop there.

257
00:15:19,880 --> 00:15:24,010
Klaus started playing the monkey
calls to birds, the truss hornbills,

258
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,930
yellow casked hornbills. It turns out
that they understand it. The birds,

259
00:15:29,260 --> 00:15:34,120
these hornbills are capable
of discriminating these
different monkey alarm

260
00:15:34,121 --> 00:15:39,040
calls. Wow. So it's a pretty
substantial Webb species,

261
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:43,540
basically eavesdropping on, on each
other's calls in these forests.

262
00:15:44,380 --> 00:15:49,200
But Klaus himself, he was still
on the outside of it all. It is,

263
00:15:49,890 --> 00:15:53,510
um, general sense of perhaps
not really belonging there.

264
00:15:53,960 --> 00:15:57,260
But then he told me about
this one day I was uh,

265
00:15:57,290 --> 00:15:59,630
working in the forest.

266
00:15:59,720 --> 00:16:03,650
He had gone out for the day and he'd
gone out alone and it was very far away

267
00:16:03,770 --> 00:16:07,250
from camp and it was in the late
afternoon and he realized that he should

268
00:16:07,251 --> 00:16:11,570
probably be heading back to camp because
I still had to walk for a, you know,

269
00:16:11,571 --> 00:16:16,070
something like 50, 20 kilometers to back
to camp. And he was walking past it,

270
00:16:16,100 --> 00:16:18,980
a kind of valley and then [inaudible]
on the other side of the valley.

271
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:20,343
Got It.

272
00:16:21,800 --> 00:16:25,940
A monkey group giving light, put alarm
calls, which doesn't happen that often.

273
00:16:26,030 --> 00:16:29,780
It was the first time that
he wasn't actively listening,

274
00:16:29,900 --> 00:16:33,830
but he heard these monkeys make
this call and recognized it.

275
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:37,790
It was absolutely striking and he was
actually quite excited by this because I

276
00:16:37,791 --> 00:16:42,260
was suddenly able to understand what
the monkeys trying to say so to speak.

277
00:16:42,300 --> 00:16:46,670
Those monkeys had picked up a Lebron Ah,

278
00:16:47,600 --> 00:16:51,890
right beneath that sound there. The
leopard would be right, but you know,

279
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,720
those monkeys were way across the valley.

280
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:58,640
So I didn't really think that
more children walked on, perhaps,

281
00:16:58,641 --> 00:17:00,770
you know, half, half a
mile further down the road.

282
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:03,860
And the next group of Diana monkeys,

283
00:17:04,340 --> 00:17:05,173
I

284
00:17:05,340 --> 00:17:06,520
still across the valley,

285
00:17:06,870 --> 00:17:07,260
okay.

286
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:11,160
Start giving leopard alarm codes as
well. And he kind of took notice of that

287
00:17:14,010 --> 00:17:16,830
and then it happened a third
time, a few minutes later.

288
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:21,900
What became clear to me very
rapidly is that elaborate was

289
00:17:23,550 --> 00:17:27,840
tracking him. Of course I couldn't
see it because he was, you know,

290
00:17:28,140 --> 00:17:33,060
dense for us. But I assume that, uh,
the, the lipid saw me of course, that,

291
00:17:33,061 --> 00:17:36,460
you know, it's just one of these
moments where you're, you know,

292
00:17:36,470 --> 00:17:40,530
you're totally alone, um,
far, far away from Cam.

293
00:17:40,710 --> 00:17:41,550
What does he do?

294
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:45,060
He, he kept walking. It happened
at fourth group called Leopard,

295
00:17:45,870 --> 00:17:47,130
fifth group called Leopard.

296
00:17:48,360 --> 00:17:51,030
And then the group stopped calling.

297
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:52,823
Yeah.

298
00:17:55,100 --> 00:17:59,570
The only thing I could think of is to
pick up, um, you know, a large branch.

299
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:03,570
It shouldn't laugh. That's
as terrifying. Klaus,

300
00:18:03,571 --> 00:18:05,400
would that stick have
done anything for you?

301
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:09,850
Uh, I, I doubt I really would have been
able to do very much with the steak.

302
00:18:10,460 --> 00:18:14,060
But as he standing there
sticking hand, he realizes

303
00:18:15,740 --> 00:18:20,330
he's just entered the forest.
He's become, do you 11th primate,

304
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:25,400
the 11th primate because there are those
10 other species of primate. And now

305
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:27,763
me,

306
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:34,390
suddenly I shifted from being the
objective observer to being a,

307
00:18:36,070 --> 00:18:39,350
you know, sort of part of
the whole crowd in there.

308
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:44,240
Even though, you know,
we're separated by 20,

309
00:18:44,241 --> 00:18:48,020
30 millions of years of
evolutionary history, you know,

310
00:18:48,021 --> 00:18:51,070
these humble creatures, um, you know,

311
00:18:51,090 --> 00:18:54,860
were able to teach me
something about, you know,

312
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:57,980
what was going on in the forest. And I
mean, of course it wasn't intentional.

313
00:18:57,981 --> 00:19:02,240
They weren't trying to inform me
or anything like that, but, um,

314
00:19:02,560 --> 00:19:04,400
it was a, a very emotional experience.

315
00:19:06,670 --> 00:19:09,670
So what happened? I mean, obviously he
didn't get eaten. What happened? Well,

316
00:19:09,700 --> 00:19:13,330
he, he made it back to camp and he's
not sure what happened to the leopard.

317
00:19:13,540 --> 00:19:17,380
The Leopard must've slinked
off into the forest in the end.

318
00:19:18,570 --> 00:19:21,440
Another story to tell each other
over beers in the evening, I suppose.

319
00:19:23,190 --> 00:19:24,500
Yeah, yeah.

320
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:29,423
Ah,

321
00:19:32,890 --> 00:19:36,070
thanks for that story too. Ari,
Daniel Shapiro, our correspondent,

322
00:19:36,250 --> 00:19:39,880
and also thanks to um, Klaus
Zuber, Bueller and cons.

323
