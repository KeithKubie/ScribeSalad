00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:02.380
CHUMLEE: What you got here?

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.620
I've got a pair of
LeBron autographed shoes.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:05.170
That's pretty cool.

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.120
JIM: These are actually
the wheat edition ones.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.500
There the 2004
All-Star game ones,

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.460
and they're a limited edition.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.710
I've never actually
seen these in person,

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:16.170
but they might be worth more
without the signature than

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:17.380
with it.
- I don't know about that--

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:18.210
CHUMLEE: No, I'm just joking.

00:00:21.830 --> 00:00:25.670
JIM: The shoes are LeBron
James 2004 All-Star game shoes.

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:28.500
They're personally mine,
but I had them autographed.

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.750
The reason I'm
selling these shoes

00:00:29.750 --> 00:00:31.210
is because I've had
them for 10 years,

00:00:31.210 --> 00:00:32.420
and I'm hoping I can get
a lot of money for them.

00:00:32.420 --> 00:00:33.580
They're a rare shoe itself.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:35.080
The autograph's
rare, and I think

00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:37.080
LeBron statistically will
go down as the number

00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.920
one player in NBA history.

00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:41.580
CHUMLEE: This is
pretty cool, man.

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.500
These are the Air Nike Zoom's.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.250
How'd you get them?

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.210
Back in 2004 when I was a kid
I was at one of the Cavs games.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:50.920
I saw him coming, didn't
have anything to sign,

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.330
so I took them right off
my feet, tossed it to him.

00:00:53.330 --> 00:00:55.420
He signed them and
tossed them right back.

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:57.830
CHUMLEE: Sweet.

00:00:57.830 --> 00:00:59.540
This is LeBron's first shoe.

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.210
They were actually afraid
to attach the name "LeBron"

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:03.620
to it at first because
they didn't know

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.210
how they were going to sell.

00:01:05.210 --> 00:01:06.710
They didn't know how he
was going to do in the NBA.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.380
But Nike decided to
give him $90 million

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:12.880
before he even played one
minute of NBA basketball.

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.420
18-years-old-- I
cannot imagine that.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.750
It paid off for him though.

00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:19.460
LeBron pushed
into the draft right

00:01:19.460 --> 00:01:21.290
after his junior
year of high school,

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:23.620
but the NBA decided
he was too young.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:25.710
Lucky for his teammates
though, because tickets

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.620
to his high school
basketball games were being

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.290
scalped for over $100 each.

00:01:31.290 --> 00:01:32.580
So what do you want
to do with them?

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:33.960
I'm looking to sell them.

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.880
OK, how much did you
want to get for them?

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:38.790
I'm looking for about $1,000.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:42.620
$1,000, OK.

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:44.670
The condition of the
shoe looks pretty good.

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.290
Looks like the autograph
is upside down.

00:01:48.290 --> 00:01:50.500
I don't know how that's
going to affect the value.

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:51.920
If you have a little
out of hang out,

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.830
I'm going to call
a friend of mine.

00:01:53.830 --> 00:01:58.080
He basically will look at this
autograph, tell me if it's real

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.170
and how much he
thinks it's worth.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:01.500
Yeah, I can hang around.

00:02:01.500 --> 00:02:03.670
All right, let me
go make a phone call.

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:05.170
I'm excited that the
expert's coming in.

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.580
Hopefully, he can
appraise it to something

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:08.080
higher than I expect it to be.

00:02:08.080 --> 00:02:10.460
And I'm excited to see
what he has to say.

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:12.620
Now, I know a lot about
shoes, but I don't know

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:14.250
very much about autographs.

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:18.000
So I called my buddy Steven
to come take a look at it.

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:21.120
We got one of the greatest
player in the world shoes here.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:22.830
These are his rookie shoes.
STEVE GRAD: Oh, cool.

00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:24.670
And he only signed
one of the shoes.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:26.170
It's right there.

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:27.500
STEVE GRAD: OK.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.330
Meeting LeBron in
person is not that easy

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:32.210
and getting near him for
autograph seekers especially

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:33.710
or people just
wanting a picture--

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:36.620
it's not really that easy
to get near this guy.

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.710
So Chum, tell me your concerns.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:40.830
Well, I don't
know if it's real.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.380
And how much is it
actually worth on his shoe?

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.120
Because this obviously
wasn't LeBron James' shoe?

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.500
STEVE GRAD: OK.

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:49.710
Now obviously, I was
look at the exemplars.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.040
The first thing starts
off here, and we kind of

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:53.460
see the same thing here.

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:55.540
And he just kind of goes
into this big mess here,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.880
and it looks like he
came off it strangely

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.830
or just signed it abruptly.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:02.880
Another example of his
signature-- once again,

00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:06.170
he starts off here
as almost a 2 3.

00:03:06.170 --> 00:03:07.670
You see here?
- Yeah.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.250
This is a little sloppier,
and then he kind of

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.040
finishes the flourish off here.

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:12.920
It matches up pretty
good to the exemplars.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:14.580
It's a little sloppier version.

00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:16.830
I really don't have a problem
with the signature though.

00:03:16.830 --> 00:03:19.170
And you think
it's OK upside down?

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.040
LeBron James--
super tough autograph.

00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.420
So upside down on
a shoe, especially

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:24.420
a rare shoe like this--

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:25.750
I don't think it really matters.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:26.710
Cool.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.540
So how much is it worth?

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.750
Well, based on
everything here,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:37.170
I'd put the value of this
right at about $350 to $400.

00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:38.540
All right, well, thank you.

00:03:38.540 --> 00:03:39.710
STEVE GRAD: Good
seeing you, bro.

00:03:39.710 --> 00:03:41.330
Take care.
JIM: You too.

00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:44.040
Just based on the fact
that LeBron so popular,

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.750
people really like that guy.

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.210
And the chances of you getting
his signature are pretty low,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.960
and I think that thing
would fly off the shelf.

00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:57.540
So we're looking
at about $200.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.460
I think with the
combination of the rare shoe

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.040
and the rare signature I think
it's just too low of an offer.

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:05.420
Unfortunately, the rare
shoe and the signature

00:04:05.420 --> 00:04:08.880
aren't going to sell
to the same customer.

00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:11.620
I can go up to maybe $250.

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:13.290
JIM: That's not enough.

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:14.710
What's your bottom number?

00:04:14.710 --> 00:04:17.380
JIM: I'd say about $600.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:20.790
CHUMLEE: It's not
going to happen.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:22.120
All right.

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:23.420
Thanks for bringing
them down though, man.

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.920
They're really cool.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.540
LeBron James is a great
player, and it's not often

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:29.620
you get to see these shoes.

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.170
JIM: Thank you.

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.620
The offer of $200 is
definitely disappointing to me.

00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:35.120
I'm going to take this
shoe back to Cleveland

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.750
and just hold onto it for
a couple of more years

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.580
until LeBron wins the
championship in Cleveland,

00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:39.920
brings it home.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:42.920
And then I'll see
what it's worth then.
