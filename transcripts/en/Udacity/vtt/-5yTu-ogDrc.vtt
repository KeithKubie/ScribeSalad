00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:05.034
according to the social readjustment scale, death of a close family member

00:00:05.034 --> 00:00:10.026
would have the rating of 63, vacation would have the rating of 13, retirement

00:00:10.026 --> 00:00:17.746
is given a rating of 45, marriage is given a rating of 50. When you begin or

00:00:17.746 --> 00:00:24.479
end school, that's given a rating of 26. The death of a close friend is given

00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:31.361
the rating 37, divorce is a 73, and that leaves pregnancy as 40 on this scale

00:00:31.361 --> 00:00:38.749
of stress. So, the key here is that we all interpret stress differently. But

00:00:38.749 --> 00:00:42.151
according to the social readjustment rating scale, this is how they access

00:00:42.151 --> 00:00:46.655
stressful life events. And don't forget the positive things such as marriage or

00:00:46.655 --> 00:00:49.154
retirement can really be stressful.
