00:00:02.460 --> 00:00:10.769
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: Hi. Good morning. My name
is Kevin Wang from 141.

00:00:10.769 --> 00:00:18.390
Thank you all for coming. You know, we have
lots of

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:26.010
chess players here. Also lots of chess players
in 141. Today

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:33.630
it's our honor to have Dr. James Magner here
to talk

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:36.489
about his new book. Also share his advice.
And

00:00:36.489 --> 00:00:41.670
Dr. Magner is a scientist, a doctor, husband,
father, investor, and

00:00:41.670 --> 00:00:43.230
a chess player. He went through college, medical
school,

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:46.350
married and raised a family. And still was
able to get in

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:47.350
some serious chess playing. His new book,
which you have

00:00:47.350 --> 00:00:52.660
now, and provide help to readers who want
to live rich and meaningful

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:59.739
lives who also want to win more chess games.
[laughter] Without

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:02.960
further ado, let's welcome James.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.640
&gt;&gt; Dr. Magner: Thank you very much. So I'm
really -- I'm really

00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.549
happy to be here. It's a real privilege for
me to be

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:18.670
here because I know how skilled and creative
people at

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.530
Google are. I had a problem. I was busy with
my career

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:28.450
and you know going to medical school and so
on. I wanted

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.890
to meet girls, okay? I wanted to do something
meaningful

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:38.350
with my career. And I wanted to, you know,
I was

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:41.320
ambitious. I wanted to get a good job that
had good pay

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.290
and benefits. I didn't want to be totally
materialistic,

00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:51.520
but I recognized I had to earn a living, pay
a mortgage,

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:54.560
buy shoes for children. And so, all of that
is important

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:57.780
to keep in mind. But I wanted to keep interests.
I'm an

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:04.189
amateur astronomer. I collect fossils. I was
in Boy Scouts so I had those interests. And

00:02:04.189 --> 00:02:07.280
I, even though I
was an adult, I wanted to keep some of those

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.650
interests.
And then, over the years, I accumulated lots

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:17.970
of stories,
because I raised two daughters, I had interesting,

00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:23.960
difficult patients. I had various crises as
we all do.

00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:28.360
And I saw that there was, in medicine sometimes
people get

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:33.150
burned out and sort of cynicism in medicine.
And I

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.190
wanted to share some of my stories because
sort of as a

00:02:38.190 --> 00:02:42.580
positive message for medical students and
trainees that

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.660
you have to keep your eye on many different
things but

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:48.030
enjoy your life and do something productive
and be a good

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:54.040
citizen and, you know, have fun. And how could
I share

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.230
some of those anecdotes and stories? Because
I'm not

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:02.421
Henry Kissinger and so nobody is going to
pay to publish

00:03:02.421 --> 00:03:06.860
my stories, which I thought were valuable.
In other

00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.330
words, I felt I had a message or interesting
and

00:03:10.330 --> 00:03:14.340
actually. Nobody wants to read a long, dull,
book so I

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:17.100
wanted to do something that was entertaining
and useful.

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.830
In other words anecdotes could be instructive
and

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:25.900
entertaining and useful. Who's going to do
it? Well, I

00:03:25.900 --> 00:03:29.450
was an amateur chess player. Now, I'm an average
player

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:33.760
that plays in tournaments. So of people that
pay 50

00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.760
dollars to sign up in a tournament, I'm sort
of average

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:45.390
in that -- so my rating is like 15/50, okay?
So and part

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:48.150
of my problem over the years is I never had
time to study

00:03:48.150 --> 00:03:51.431
chess, really. So I decided over the years
I would

00:03:51.431 --> 00:03:57.570
collect little traps and tricks I could use
occasionally to beat

00:03:57.570 --> 00:04:01.261
really strong players. And it was fun. Although
I would

00:04:01.261 --> 00:04:04.960
usually lose to strong players. [laughter]
To occasionally surprise

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:07.930
one of them and beat them. So I thought what
I'll do,

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:12.430
since I played for 40 years, that I would
collect some

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:15.810
of these games where I actually tricked somebody
that was

00:04:15.810 --> 00:04:22.120
hundreds of points better than me. It can
happen. And

00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.240
put those together. And then, interweave my,
the

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:28.820
things that I really wanted to publish, which
are my

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:33.979
anecdotes. And have a chess publisher publish
it and

00:04:33.979 --> 00:04:35.680
then that way I wouldn't have to pay. Because
if you

00:04:35.680 --> 00:04:39.850
publish your own book it's like 20,000 dollars.
Maybe

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:42.090
electronic publishing is cheaper now. But
I wanted

00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:45.970
actually a book. I'm my age if I'm going to
publish a

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:51.990
book, I want a book. So I thought, "how could
I get this

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:54.539
done?" So to make a long story short, I sent
out samples

00:04:54.539 --> 00:04:59.409
to three chess publishers, one of them in
New Haven, who is

00:04:59.409 --> 00:05:05.599
a prominent chess publisher. Sent me a response,
"it's an intriguing -- some intriguing material

00:05:05.599 --> 00:05:07.889
-- come
meet me on Saturday morning; we'll talk about

00:05:07.889 --> 00:05:12.889
it." So
that morning I put on my necktie. I had coffee

00:05:12.889 --> 00:05:15.770
with my
wife and she said, "Jim I just want to protect

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:21.129
your ego because
this is a chess publisher. He's going to tell

00:05:21.129 --> 00:05:23.400
you
you're an average player. You have a very

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:26.540
creative, like a
tricky style, so it's kind of, you have some

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:30.720
intriguing games. But you're kind of an average
player.

00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:35.630
But all this other crap has to come out. [laughter]
And so, I said,

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:37.470
"well, we'll see what happens." So I met with
the

00:05:37.470 --> 00:05:41.410
publisher and he said, "well, Jim you have
an intriguing

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:43.900
style. You have tricks and traps. You beat
some strong

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:48.840
players. But basically you're an average player.
You

00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.590
probably have too many games. Take some of
the games

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.259
out. [audience chuckles] But put in some more
of these stories, because

00:05:54.259 --> 00:05:59.279
those anecdotes are great, okay? [laughter]
So that's the kind of

00:05:59.279 --> 00:06:03.939
publisher I really needed to meet. So his
name is Hanon

00:06:03.939 --> 00:06:07.060
Russell. And he's published many chess books
over the

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:12.969
last 30 years in the United States. So he
committed the

00:06:12.969 --> 00:06:16.689
money. Actually, he gave me a 1-page contracted
saying

00:06:16.689 --> 00:06:19.740
he was going to get 90 percent, I'm going
to get 10

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:24.310
percent. So I said, "let me -- I played chess
for 40

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:28.210
years, I wrote up the games, I wrote up my
stories. You

00:06:28.210 --> 00:06:30.291
publish it and you get 90 percent and I get
10 percent."

00:06:30.291 --> 00:06:33.509
And he said yes. Because of course, he's putting
up the

00:06:33.509 --> 00:06:38.960
money -- he has to earn his money back. And
I said,

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.500
"sold." [laughter] Signed it. So that was
-- I mean,

00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.870
so I want to make clear at the very beginning
-- I'm not

00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:51.139
here to try to sell anything really or to,
I'm not

00:06:51.139 --> 00:06:54.139
doing this to make money. I feel I have a
valuable

00:06:54.139 --> 00:06:57.029
message especially more young medical trainees
or

00:06:57.029 --> 00:07:03.080
actually any bright college age person or
professional. I hope that

00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:06.840
you'll actually. You can skip the chess parts.
If

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:10.870
you'll actually look at it over the holidays,
it's

00:07:10.870 --> 00:07:13.680
entertaining and I think you'll take something
away from it.

00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:16.639
So I'm just going to read some excerpts if
that's the way

00:07:16.639 --> 00:07:21.340
you usually do this. And also, this is very
informal.

00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.400
So you are welcome to contact me later. I
work at

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:30.521
Genzyme down the street. I'm an endocrinologist.
But I

00:07:30.521 --> 00:07:33.249
mostly sit at a computer all day. You know
what that's

00:07:33.249 --> 00:07:40.660
like, doing clinical research documents. So
in the

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:44.150
introduction, I talk about the development
of expertise

00:07:44.150 --> 00:07:48.599
in an area such as skill playing chess. Is
that the result of

00:07:48.599 --> 00:07:52.930
innate talent or is that a skill even an average
person

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:57.060
can achieve if enough hours of study and practice
were

00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:00.439
applied? Intuitively many persons believe
that innate

00:08:00.439 --> 00:08:04.289
talent as well as practice are required. There's
a guy

00:08:04.289 --> 00:08:10.479
named Philip Ross who came up with a 10,000
hour rule, a

00:08:10.479 --> 00:08:13.860
hypothesis much discussed in recent years,
that states

00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:16.099
that a bright person who wants to have a skill
in some

00:08:16.099 --> 00:08:19.960
area need only study and practice that skill
for 10,000

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:24.310
hours to achieve a very high level of expertise.
Let me

00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:28.490
now do a calculation. Assuming a person has
a spouse and

00:08:28.490 --> 00:08:32.289
a family as well as a job and other responsibilities,
one

00:08:32.289 --> 00:08:35.150
might potentially only be able to study or
play chess for

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:39.070
one Saturday afternoon for four hours at most.
That

00:08:39.070 --> 00:08:43.340
would commit 2500 Saturdays or 48 years before
one would

00:08:43.340 --> 00:08:47.710
achieve expertise in chess if the 10,000 hour
rule is

00:08:47.710 --> 00:08:54.540
valid. And that can be a discouraging realization
although I thought it was probable, I suppose,

00:08:54.540 --> 00:08:58.100
that after
only 1,000 hours some people may be reasonably

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:03.750
good. So
other people have thought about this too.

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:07.350
Charles
Krauthammer who's sometimes on TV, a very

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:14.270
smart man. He
wrote a review -- a little article -- in the

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:18.750
New Republic
in July 1983 called "Joy and Madness at the

00:09:18.750 --> 00:09:22.240
Board: the romance of
chess". And he quoted at the beginning of

00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:28.200
his article HG
Wells. You have, let us say, a promising politician,

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:33.620
a
rising artist that you wish to destroy. Dagger

00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:40.290
or bomb
are archaic, clumsy, and unreliable. But teach

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:45.030
him,
inoculate him with chess, so that's the way

00:09:45.030 --> 00:09:49.540
to destroy
your enemy. For Wells, chess was not just

00:09:49.540 --> 00:09:53.590
an addiction,
its continuing popularity constituted a kind

00:09:53.590 --> 00:09:59.340
of heresy. Wells wrote, quote, "The
passion for playing chess is one of the most

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.780
unaccountable in the world. It slaps the theory
of

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:06.440
natural selection in the face. [laughter]
It is the most absorbing

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.381
of occupations, the least satisfying of desires.
It

00:10:10.381 --> 00:10:15.190
annihilates a man". So Krauthammer humorously
speculated

00:10:15.190 --> 00:10:19.440
that Well's ire had been formed at an impressionable
age

00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:22.640
when he left a rook hanging in an important
game and he

00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.340
postulated that Wells never quite recovered.
So could

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.090
be. So one of my themes in the book is that
you need to

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:35.570
have hobbies like chess, but don't get so
addicted or

00:10:35.570 --> 00:10:40.120
taken by whether it's swimmer or running or
whatever your

00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:43.440
hobby is. You do need to keep balance. You
have

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:48.390
families, you have children, you have careers,
you have

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:52.050
other important interests perhaps with your
church or

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.430
certain charities. And we -- Kevin and I -- when
we go

00:10:56.430 --> 00:11:00.850
to the chess tournaments, I think we see some
rather odd

00:11:00.850 --> 00:11:04.540
people there sometimes who have spent 40 hours
a week

00:11:04.540 --> 00:11:09.500
playing chess. And like they barely have enough
money to

00:11:09.500 --> 00:11:14.720
buy groceries,I think. And so, it's -- one
can take

00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:17.780
things a little bit too far. And also probably
the new

00:11:17.780 --> 00:11:21.610
addiction might be Texas Hold'em poker, which
I also enjoy

00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:24.420
playing, but I see some of these people at
poker

00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:31.260
tournaments who probably dig ditches for a
living and for them $100 to sit down and play

00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:34.350
in a poker tournament, that's a lot of money
for them.

00:11:34.350 --> 00:11:39.220
And they're not thinking clearly in terms
of the way

00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:49.420
they're investing their time. I did well in
school and

00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.620
it's important for the people still in college
who might

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:56.070
read this to have the priority to do well
in school. And

00:11:56.070 --> 00:11:59.430
I won a scholarship to come over to Woods
Hole, Massachusetts to do

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:06.820
biology studies for a summer in 1972. That
was the era of,

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:11.180
you know, a little wildness and free love
and all that

00:12:11.180 --> 00:12:15.010
stuff. I was just in college, at the summer
experience,

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:19.800
sort of a long way from home in Illinois.
I was a good

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.330
boy, okay? But it was a coming of age experience
for me

00:12:24.330 --> 00:12:29.060
that summer. And I'll read you one anecdote.
During the

00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.050
summer of 1972, after my junior year in college,
I was

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.100
awarded a small scholarship to live and study
in Woods Hole, Massachusetts. I

00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:39.110
was to take the summer biology course and
complete a

00:12:39.110 --> 00:12:43.300
well-defined research project in a few weeks.
if possible.

00:12:43.300 --> 00:12:45.890
I joined a group of a dozen bright students
from around

00:12:45.890 --> 00:12:49.180
the U.S.. We had a great time added both at
work and play.

00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:53.660
During the first week, Dr. Janish invited
the students to spend an informal evening

00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.930
at his home. We
had some lively discussions about biology,

00:12:57.930 --> 00:13:04.030
sciences and Woods Hole when at about 1030
p.m., one of the young ladies from California

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:09.300
stood up and
shouted, "let's go skinny dipping." Everyone

00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:13.230
immediately
agreed and we raced out the front door to

00:13:13.230 --> 00:13:17.620
the nearby beach.
Although I'll admit that this shy and studious

00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:22.030
boy from
Illinois, -- land of endless corn fields--,

00:13:22.030 --> 00:13:25.490
was trailing in the
rear and was quite bemused by this sudden

00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:29.840
turn of events.
And so, that was one of my first quite memorable

00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:33.760
experiences.
And of course, we did good science at Woods

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:39.950
Hole also. [laughter] In the book --
I've been interested in human evolution, in

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:43.440
genetics
for a number of years. I put some material

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:48.680
in the book
about that as well. And I talk about DNA and

00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.930
sort of
like you, probably most educated laypersons

00:13:52.930 --> 00:14:00.300
know. That
all of us share almost identical DNA sequences.

00:14:00.300 --> 00:14:02.770
Of
course the police can track down criminals

00:14:02.770 --> 00:14:08.500
by the
occasional differences in certain areas. But

00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:12.450
like on
page 31, I mention that, "if the long strings

00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:15.090
of the DNA
letter sequences from any two persons were

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:20.360
set side by
side and compared, about 999 out of every

00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.530
1,000 letters would be
exactly the same in the two sequences. Of

00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.020
the
approximately 3 billion letters in each long

00:14:28.020 --> 00:14:31.790
string, the
inheritable differences in each person thus

00:14:31.790 --> 00:14:38.970
would consist
of just 0.1 percent of the sequence. In contrast,

00:14:38.970 --> 00:14:43.480
chimpanzees are approximately 7 to 10 times
more genetically diverse.

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.510
Moreover, the genetic differences between
a chimpanzee

00:14:46.510 --> 00:14:50.100
and a human are 20 times greater than the
differences

00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:54.590
between two average humans even though the
overall DNA

00:14:54.590 --> 00:14:58.320
sequence of an average chimpanzee is about
98.5 percent

00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.890
identical to that of an average human. The
high

00:15:01.890 --> 00:15:05.710
similarity of the DNA sequences among individual
people

00:15:05.710 --> 00:15:08.860
is evidence that all humans descended from
a relatively

00:15:08.860 --> 00:15:12.610
small group of ancestors perhaps because many
thousands

00:15:12.610 --> 00:15:15.260
of years ago the human population went through
a

00:15:15.260 --> 00:15:19.430
so-called bottleneck because of famine or
disease or lack

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:22.670
of resources. The bottleneck concept would
be more

00:15:22.670 --> 00:15:25.980
believable if our ancestors were living in
a relatively

00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.300
small region so that a famine, for example,
could affect an entire

00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.470
location where the ancestors lived. Intriguingly
our direct

00:15:34.470 --> 00:15:37.410
ancestors possibly moved out of Africa about
50,000 to

00:15:37.410 --> 00:15:41.050
100,000 years ago after stopping for awhile
in the Middle

00:15:41.050 --> 00:15:44.741
East and then they spread over a wide area.
They

00:15:44.741 --> 00:15:47.420
followed in the footsteps of other hominids
who had

00:15:47.420 --> 00:15:51.740
exited Africa in prior waves of migration.
And these

00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:56.080
earlier human-like creatures who had migrated
out earlier

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:59.060
shared a common ancestor with us, but the
ones who had

00:15:59.060 --> 00:16:02.720
immigrated earlier from Africa were not, for
the most part,

00:16:02.720 --> 00:16:06.290
our direct ancestors. In fact, there may have
been a

00:16:06.290 --> 00:16:09.370
little breeding between these separate groups
under special

00:16:09.370 --> 00:16:12.080
circumstances. And then I mention in the next
paragraph

00:16:12.080 --> 00:16:17.450
an intriguing theory by Huff and all from
University of

00:16:17.450 --> 00:16:20.410
Utah. They looked at so-called mobile elements
in the

00:16:20.410 --> 00:16:24.700
DNA and they found that about a million years
ago there

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.060
were -- based on their mathematical calculations
-- there

00:16:27.060 --> 00:16:34.161
were only about 18,500 animals that were human.
So we

00:16:34.161 --> 00:16:38.060
came from a very, very limit -- small group.
And that's

00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:43.920
sort of an intriguing story. In medical school,
that was

00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:48.210
also a coming of life experience. And I only
played a

00:16:48.210 --> 00:16:51.821
little chess in medical school. I'd been an
Eagle Scout

00:16:51.821 --> 00:16:55.660
in my hometown of Quincy. So as part of my
scouting

00:16:55.660 --> 00:16:59.210
experience, I learned to shoot a small caliber
rifle.

00:16:59.210 --> 00:17:02.840
But I'd never seen a gunshot wound. Many patients
with

00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:05.189
knife and gunshot wounds were brought to the
emergency

00:17:05.189 --> 00:17:08.020
room at the University of Chicago where I
went to medical

00:17:08.020 --> 00:17:11.999
school. And one evening, as I was following
a surgical

00:17:11.999 --> 00:17:15.120
resident around on call, his beeper went off
and he was asked to

00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:18.259
come to the ER right away to see a young man
who had been

00:17:18.259 --> 00:17:23.059
shot. I road down the elevator with the resident
and I

00:17:23.059 --> 00:17:25.640
was rather uncomfortable. So I was still a
medical

00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.620
student then. Because I had no idea what this
was going

00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:32.570
to be like. The two of us were directed to
an

00:17:32.570 --> 00:17:35.999
examination room and I held my breath as we
stepped through the

00:17:35.999 --> 00:17:41.110
door. There on the exam table sat a 25-year-old
man

00:17:41.110 --> 00:17:45.280
looking more annoyed than traumatically injured.
He wore

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:49.450
a bright purple vest over a lime green shirt
and sported

00:17:49.450 --> 00:17:54.149
a large gray felt hat with a small orange
feather on one

00:17:54.149 --> 00:17:59.899
side. He looked up at us and pointed at his
left thigh.

00:17:59.899 --> 00:18:02.470
The nurses had removed his pants and had applied
pressure

00:18:02.470 --> 00:18:06.289
bandages where a small caliber bullet had
entered and

00:18:06.289 --> 00:18:10.260
also exited his thigh. We unwrapped the bandages
to

00:18:10.260 --> 00:18:13.309
examine the small tears in the skin where
the bullet had

00:18:13.309 --> 00:18:17.980
passed clean through. After a brief medical
history, the

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:21.020
resident showed me how he could tell the path
of the

00:18:21.020 --> 00:18:24.809
bullet had not hit the bone. The pulses in
the leg were

00:18:24.809 --> 00:18:28.580
normal and the neurologic examination of the
leg also was

00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:32.710
completely normal. As I watched with a suppressed
smile,

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:35.750
the resident expertly applied a band aid to
both the

00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:38.659
entrance and exit wounds, shook the man's
hand and

00:18:38.659 --> 00:18:41.830
pointed him to the checkout desk. So that
was the first

00:18:41.830 --> 00:18:47.100
gunshot wound I ever saw. Then I'll just quickly
add.

00:18:47.100 --> 00:18:50.451
Sadly, not all of my experiences with gunshot
wound

00:18:50.451 --> 00:18:54.230
patients were as lighthearted. By the time
of my fourth

00:18:54.230 --> 00:18:57.710
year, surgical rotation, I'd established myself
as a

00:18:57.710 --> 00:19:01.519
smart student who was very precise, well organized
and

00:19:01.519 --> 00:19:05.419
highly competent. But unfortunately in the
eyes of my

00:19:05.419 --> 00:19:11.610
surgeon supervisors, clearly inclined to internal
medicine instead of surgery. They brought

00:19:11.610 --> 00:19:14.529
me one evening
to the surgical intensive care unit where

00:19:14.529 --> 00:19:18.130
a middle-aged woman lay
intubated on a respirator with multiple IV

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:21.899
lines, a Foley
catheter, a chest tube etcetera, etcetera.

00:19:21.899 --> 00:19:26.690
She had been shot in the
chest and abdomen four times by her husband

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:30.539
and had been
stabilized in surgery that day. The surgeons

00:19:30.539 --> 00:19:33.929
told me to
watch her all the night, keep track of all

00:19:33.929 --> 00:19:37.499
the central
lines, IVs, medications, blood transfusions,

00:19:37.499 --> 00:19:40.480
urine flow,
chest tube output, vital signs, respiratory

00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:43.789
settings,
blood gases, etcetera. And give them a call

00:19:43.789 --> 00:19:48.620
if I had any serious
problems. I was thrilled -- so fourth year

00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:52.039
student -- I
was thrilled by this opportunity to manage

00:19:52.039 --> 00:19:55.419
a complicated
and very ill patient along with the skilled

00:19:55.419 --> 00:19:59.779
nursing staff
and characteristically and quite understandably

00:19:59.779 --> 00:20:02.499
the
surgeons were thrilled to leave these medical

00:20:02.499 --> 00:20:06.039
tasks to a
bright student so that they could get back

00:20:06.039 --> 00:20:08.889
to the
operating room. Different people are just

00:20:08.889 --> 00:20:14.059
naturally
inclined to different sorts of challenges.

00:20:14.059 --> 00:20:18.669
All went well
until midnight when a hospital security officer

00:20:18.669 --> 00:20:23.100
peeked
into the intensive care unit to see me. "Hey

00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:26.649
Doc. Got
to talk to you," he whispered. And although

00:20:26.649 --> 00:20:30.110
I was wearing
a white coat, I was not a doctor, just a fourth

00:20:30.110 --> 00:20:34.009
year
student. We just got a call that this lady's

00:20:34.009 --> 00:20:37.299
husband
found out she is still alive so he's grabbed

00:20:37.299 --> 00:20:41.259
his gun and
is on the way to the hospital to finish her

00:20:41.259 --> 00:20:46.490
off. "Oh", I
replied numbly while holding two clipboards

00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:50.850
and three
flowcharts. [clears throat] "Just wanted to

00:20:50.850 --> 00:20:55.410
let you know,Doc, so you can
be ready if the man comes in here." [laughter]He

00:20:55.410 --> 00:20:58.659
shrugged and then added,
"the chief asked me to sit down the hall for

00:20:58.659 --> 00:21:02.770
a couple of
hours so I'll be here." Not feeling much better

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.789
about the
security situation, I kept the IV's running,

00:21:06.789 --> 00:21:09.669
the blood
transfusing, the chest tube draining, the

00:21:09.669 --> 00:21:12.549
respirator
pumping, the urine flowing and the blood pressure

00:21:12.549 --> 00:21:17.330
stable
all night until I was relieved in the morning.

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.990
The angry
husband never showed up. So that's another

00:21:22.990 --> 00:21:29.009
story. We
also took care of indigent patients in Chicago.

00:21:29.009 --> 00:21:33.129
And some
of them were alcoholics, criminals, down and

00:21:33.129 --> 00:21:38.619
out people.
And they would lose weight, become malnourished

00:21:38.619 --> 00:21:43.200
and some
of them would get tuberculosis. So we took

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.470
care of them.
On one occasion, a young physician was visiting

00:21:46.470 --> 00:21:50.360
from
England and he walked -- we walked him around

00:21:50.360 --> 00:21:53.360
the ward.
While standing at the bedside, I presented

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:57.480
to him a case
of a man who was improving on anti-tuberculosis

00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:02.389
medications. The young doctor was incredulous
that we

00:22:02.389 --> 00:22:06.080
were still seeing cases of TB, commonly, in
the United

00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:10.110
States since during his training he had not
seen one case

00:22:10.110 --> 00:22:14.840
in England. I explained that our impoverished
urban

00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:18.250
areas still had malnourished or alcoholic
or other down

00:22:18.250 --> 00:22:23.330
and out persons with TB. With typical British
humor he

00:22:23.330 --> 00:22:31.529
responded adamantly, "not in our slums." So
it was

00:22:31.529 --> 00:22:34.850
interesting to go to medical school in an
urban area

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:38.100
dealing with all sorts of people, but still
not too much

00:22:38.100 --> 00:22:44.950
time for chess. But I was beginning to realize
a few

00:22:44.950 --> 00:22:49.049
basic principles about chess as I was playing
a few

00:22:49.049 --> 00:22:56.700
people. One needs to gain a a reasonable understanding
of the basic chess openings and focus on about

00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:00.570
a half
dozen openings for more careful study. You

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:04.730
can't learn
every opening. So with the limited time that

00:23:04.730 --> 00:23:09.920
we have in
our lives to do a hobby like chess, you need

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.279
to be
selective and focus on just certain parts

00:23:14.279 --> 00:23:18.130
of it. In
addition to just a few openings, you need

00:23:18.130 --> 00:23:23.440
to gain insight
into important chess techniques. The most

00:23:23.440 --> 00:23:26.029
important
techniques probably are practicing king and

00:23:26.029 --> 00:23:30.830
pawn endings,
typical mating nets of the way certain pieces

00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:34.490
come
together, let's say against the castled king.

00:23:34.490 --> 00:23:38.759
Proper use
of the rooks which even top experts make mistakes

00:23:38.759 --> 00:23:40.950
when
you're down to just a king and couple pawns

00:23:40.950 --> 00:23:45.940
and a rook on the
board. So there are definite sort of physiological

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:50.080
rules
the way those rooks and pawns interact and

00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:53.720
it's very,
if you know those, sometimes a good player

00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:57.529
will not be
optimally positioning those rooks and you

00:23:57.529 --> 00:24:01.399
can beat them.
You should keep a record of tournament games

00:24:01.399 --> 00:24:05.169
and study
those games. You can play over famous games

00:24:05.169 --> 00:24:09.049
in chess
history. That's always fun to do. You should

00:24:09.049 --> 00:24:11.249
get
adequate sleep and avoid alcohol the night

00:24:11.249 --> 00:24:15.129
before a
tournament. Learn some opening traps both

00:24:15.129 --> 00:24:17.980
for black and
white and be boldfaced enough to actually

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:23.110
try them during
important games. So I have 31 games in here.

00:24:23.110 --> 00:24:26.909
Many of
them I won by an opening trap. And it's embarrassing

00:24:26.909 --> 00:24:30.200
to
the opponent if you can beat them in 15 or

00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:32.929
20 moves.
Especially if they're a whole lot stronger

00:24:32.929 --> 00:24:38.040
than you are.
It's because they underestimated you. You

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.930
surprise them.
They weren't ready for it. You need to. We

00:24:41.930 --> 00:24:44.399
play with
clocks of course, so you manage your time

00:24:44.399 --> 00:24:48.140
well in the
games. Because, if you don't do that, you

00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.289
don't really have
time to properly think at the critical end

00:24:51.289 --> 00:24:56.119
stage of the
game. Have discipline and remain highly attentive

00:24:56.119 --> 00:24:59.119
during
games to watch for small errors or inaccuracies

00:24:59.119 --> 00:25:02.239
by
opponents. Consider carefully when it may

00:25:02.239 --> 00:25:05.419
be to your
advantage to trade off queens and other pieces

00:25:05.419 --> 00:25:08.320
to take
dangerous weapons out of your opponent's hands

00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:13.280
and so on.
And so, why try some of these -- I'm not reading

00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.419
them
all, but why try some of these trappy, tricky

00:25:16.419 --> 00:25:20.059
plays? It's
because against a very strong opponent you're

00:25:20.059 --> 00:25:23.559
going to
lose anyway. [laughter] So you might as well

00:25:23.559 --> 00:25:26.460
try something a little
bit unusual. If you're playing somebody your

00:25:26.460 --> 00:25:31.369
own
strength, you should probably be very disciplined

00:25:31.369 --> 00:25:34.210
and
play really the most correct way that you

00:25:34.210 --> 00:25:36.639
can. But if you're
playing somebody hundreds of points higher

00:25:36.639 --> 00:25:40.202
be a little
creative because you're probably going to

00:25:40.202 --> 00:25:44.230
lose the game
anyway. Accept the fact that you will lose

00:25:44.230 --> 00:25:47.440
to a strong
opponent in any case and you are trying a

00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.899
somewhat
desperate strategy to win the game. Keep in

00:25:50.899 --> 00:25:55.769
mind Teddy
Roosevelt's observation. Quote, "Far better

00:25:55.769 --> 00:25:59.250
it is" -- you can
almost see him saying this -- "far better

00:25:59.250 --> 00:26:03.710
it is to dare
mighty things, to win glorious triumphs even

00:26:03.710 --> 00:26:07.379
though
checkered by failure than to rank with those

00:26:07.379 --> 00:26:11.590
poor spirits
who neither enjoy nor suffer much because

00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.570
they live in
the gray twilight that knows neither victory

00:26:15.570 --> 00:26:22.450
nor defeat".
Well, I finish my medical school and then

00:26:22.450 --> 00:26:26.759
I had met a
girl. She was from Texas. So I decided to

00:26:26.759 --> 00:26:31.159
do my
internship and residency in San Antonio. So

00:26:31.159 --> 00:26:38.840
we loaded up
her car and drove to Texas. So on Page 48,

00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:42.549
I talk about
that little trip. Things were looking up.

00:26:42.549 --> 00:26:46.100
I was
finishing medical school in 1977. I was engaged

00:26:46.100 --> 00:26:49.169
to be
married that summer. I also had been accepted

00:26:49.169 --> 00:26:51.450
at my
first choice hospital for internship in internal

00:26:51.450 --> 00:26:56.649
medicine. The drive went well till we were
about 30

00:26:56.649 --> 00:27:00.119
miles outside Little Rock, Arkansas. We were
on the

00:27:00.119 --> 00:27:02.820
4-lane highway and the Charger started coughing
and

00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:05.769
losing power. So Glenda pulled it over to
the side of

00:27:05.769 --> 00:27:09.779
the highway. We sat stunned for a moment as
cars and

00:27:09.779 --> 00:27:13.809
trucks whizzed by, each one slightly rocking
our stalled

00:27:13.809 --> 00:27:18.679
car. It was still light although dusk was
coming. And

00:27:18.679 --> 00:27:22.279
there were pine trees as far as we could see.
We stood

00:27:22.279 --> 00:27:25.299
outside the car and I raised the hood. Of
course, this

00:27:25.299 --> 00:27:30.190
was before cell phones. 1977. For several
minutes, the

00:27:30.190 --> 00:27:34.470
cars sped by, but after a quarter hour, one
old small

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:38.149
station wagon passed us but slowed, pulled
to our side of

00:27:38.149 --> 00:27:42.259
the highway, then backed up 50 yards to reach
us where we

00:27:42.259 --> 00:27:47.200
were parked. A clean cut man in his 30s walked
back

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:52.379
toward us. "Out of gas?" he asked. "No, the
car just lost

00:27:52.379 --> 00:27:54.700
power," I replied, "so I guess we're going
to need a tow

00:27:54.700 --> 00:27:58.960
truck." We shook hands and I was certainly
glad he had

00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.860
stopped. He said to grab anything valuable
out of the

00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.720
car and then, and he would give us a ride
to the next

00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:06.220
exit where he thought there was a filling
station and

00:28:06.220 --> 00:28:09.580
someone could probably arrange for a tow from
there. He

00:28:09.580 --> 00:28:13.720
smiled then handed me a newspaper he carried
with him. A

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.609
pro-communist newspaper with a hammer and
sickle in the

00:28:16.609 --> 00:28:20.879
top corner. "I also want to give you this,"
he said

00:28:20.879 --> 00:28:24.210
earnestly, "and I really want you to read
it and think

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:29.919
about it." I was now more stunned than when
the car had

00:28:29.919 --> 00:28:34.629
died. I realized that I was in the woods in
Arkansas

00:28:34.629 --> 00:28:37.210
talking to someone who should be feeling a
little out of

00:28:37.210 --> 00:28:41.820
place in this county. But I took the newspaper,
thanked

00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:45.020
him, and when I reached into the Charger to
collect a

00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:48.470
small travel bag, I tossed the newspaper into
the

00:28:48.470 --> 00:28:53.580
backseat. The ride to the exit took less than
three

00:28:53.580 --> 00:28:55.869
minutes and we hopped out of the filling station
and

00:28:55.869 --> 00:29:00.520
waved good-bye and I really did appreciate
his help. The

00:29:00.520 --> 00:29:03.730
station owner said we were in luck since Merle
was just

00:29:03.730 --> 00:29:07.000
bringing the tow truck into the shop right
now and he

00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:10.049
would be happy to tow us into a place he knew
in Little

00:29:10.049 --> 00:29:14.220
Rock that could fix our Dodge. In a half hour,
a very

00:29:14.220 --> 00:29:18.379
large tow truck pulled in, driven by a very
muscular young

00:29:18.379 --> 00:29:22.600
man. I helped Glenda up the high step into
the front

00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:26.380
seat next to the driver and then I stepped
up, slid on to

00:29:26.380 --> 00:29:29.879
the seat, shut the door. Off we went to retrieve
our

00:29:29.879 --> 00:29:34.299
sick car. Merle told us to take any other
valuables out

00:29:34.299 --> 00:29:36.720
of the car since he would drop the car at
the dealership

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:40.380
then drop us at a nearby motel. This time
when I reached

00:29:40.380 --> 00:29:43.399
into the Charger, I had a couple of minutes
to stuff the

00:29:43.399 --> 00:29:46.759
communist newspaper into one of my small bags
out of

00:29:46.759 --> 00:29:51.159
sight. I didn't want that in the car where
the workmen

00:29:51.159 --> 00:29:54.659
might see it. Merle raised the front wheels
of the

00:29:54.659 --> 00:29:58.159
charger and hooked it up. We climbed back
into the front

00:29:58.159 --> 00:30:02.009
seat and off we went to Little Rock. It was
now dark.

00:30:02.009 --> 00:30:05.139
In a couple of minutes I realized we were
going about 85

00:30:05.139 --> 00:30:09.940
miles per hour. I looked back and yes our
car was still

00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:13.859
dragging along behind. Next I realized in
the dashboard

00:30:13.859 --> 00:30:17.020
in front of our driver was a large black pistol
without a

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:21.220
holster and next to that was a 3-inch stack
of bills

00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:25.409
secured with a couple of rubber bands. "I
guess you are

00:30:25.409 --> 00:30:28.950
ready for any trouble," I said in a loud voice
to be heard

00:30:28.950 --> 00:30:33.049
above the roar of the truck as I pointed at
the gun.

00:30:33.049 --> 00:30:37.149
"Yep", said Merle. "Okay if I put on the radio?
My

00:30:37.149 --> 00:30:41.310
favorite show is on now," he added. Not being
in an

00:30:41.310 --> 00:30:45.859
argumentative mood, I agreed and he clicked
the button.

00:30:45.859 --> 00:30:49.649
The church choir was just starting "Holy,
Holy, Holy" and

00:30:49.649 --> 00:30:53.230
Merle turned the volume up higher as the engine
roared.

00:30:53.230 --> 00:30:56.769
I think he also picked up the pace to 90 miles
an hour.

00:30:56.769 --> 00:31:00.769
Our car, remarkably, was still attached. The
next few

00:31:00.769 --> 00:31:03.609
minutes were quite memorable as we raced along
the

00:31:03.609 --> 00:31:07.519
highway in the dark swerving around slower
traffic, with

00:31:07.519 --> 00:31:11.720
the gospel choir on the radio at full blast.
Soon we

00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:14.090
were at the dealership where we dropped the
car by the

00:31:14.090 --> 00:31:17.600
front door. A few blocks away at the motel
we bid

00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:22.179
farewell to Merle with our sincere thanks
and a small tip

00:31:22.179 --> 00:31:25.179
since at that point we barely had any money
in our

00:31:25.179 --> 00:31:28.989
checking accounts. Merle did his job well
and he did it

00:31:28.989 --> 00:31:33.409
in style -- Arkansas style. The next afternoon,
we had a

00:31:33.409 --> 00:31:37.221
repaired car and an interesting story to tell.
So that

00:31:37.221 --> 00:31:44.340
was my adventure with Merle. I put in a chapter
about my

00:31:44.340 --> 00:31:49.179
first daughter. Having children is wonderful.
There can

00:31:49.179 --> 00:31:53.679
be surprises. So show of hands. Do some of
you have

00:31:53.679 --> 00:32:00.840
kids? So, okay great. So there's always surprises.
So

00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:05.369
I'll just read a little bit from Chapter 7.
Erin was

00:32:05.369 --> 00:32:08.070
born at the Bethesda Naval Hospital in Maryland
in

00:32:08.070 --> 00:32:13.320
January 1981. Glenda and I had joked. Remember
I said

00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.710
January. Glenda and I had joked somewhat nervously
about

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:20.249
what might happen if she were in labor just
before or

00:32:20.249 --> 00:32:25.629
during Super Bowl. But actually, all went
well that day.

00:32:25.629 --> 00:32:27.960
Glenda had to stay in the hospital an extra
day because

00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.690
of a low grade fever which gave me an opportunity
to

00:32:30.690 --> 00:32:33.559
speak again with the pediatrician who had
briefly

00:32:33.559 --> 00:32:37.190
examined our baby. I told him that I was a
bit of a nervous

00:32:37.190 --> 00:32:41.460
new father and I was not highly trained in
pediatrics so

00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:44.869
I asked him, please, to re-examine our little
girl one more time

00:32:44.869 --> 00:32:48.009
very carefully. That way I would know that
when I got

00:32:48.009 --> 00:32:52.009
her home if she was cranky or had some other
issue I

00:32:52.009 --> 00:32:55.519
would be more certain that the root cause
was not really

00:32:55.519 --> 00:33:00.509
a major problem. He laughed and agreed and
all was well.

00:33:00.509 --> 00:33:02.659
We brought our baby back to our apartment
on the third

00:33:02.659 --> 00:33:07.129
day after her birth but she didn't take her
breast-feedings very eagerly and she slept

00:33:07.129 --> 00:33:11.129
quietly most
of the time. Others commented how lucky we

00:33:11.129 --> 00:33:15.890
were to have
a quote good baby. When she was ten days old,

00:33:15.890 --> 00:33:19.100
I came home
from work and found Glenda crying because

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.859
the baby again
had seem to not take to breast-feedings very

00:33:21.859 --> 00:33:26.140
well and was
fussy and crying. Over the course of the evening,

00:33:26.140 --> 00:33:29.809
I took
a look at the baby more with a doctor's eye

00:33:29.809 --> 00:33:34.840
than a
father's eye but I knew little about babies.

00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:38.619
I was
certain that she had been very carefully examined

00:33:38.619 --> 00:33:43.500
twice
about a week ago by the pediatrician. But

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:46.470
by 10 p.m., I
noted that her respiratory rate had increased

00:33:46.470 --> 00:33:50.299
and she
started having what are called rib retractions.

00:33:50.299 --> 00:33:53.229
And
early physical sign of difficult breathing.

00:33:53.229 --> 00:33:57.249
I told
Glenda I might be overreacting but I thought

00:33:57.249 --> 00:34:00.419
there were
objective signs of a respiratory problem and

00:34:00.419 --> 00:34:05.230
I suggested
we take the baby to the emergency room. When

00:34:05.230 --> 00:34:08.210
we arrived
at the emergency room, the staff was responsible

00:34:08.210 --> 00:34:10.350
enough
to take a look at Erin within just a minute

00:34:10.350 --> 00:34:13.450
or two and
they immediately felt there was some sort

00:34:13.450 --> 00:34:16.780
of important
respiratory problem. During the next 60 minutes,

00:34:16.780 --> 00:34:19.530
her
respiratory problem worsened rapidly and Erin

00:34:19.530 --> 00:34:22.510
was
intubated and placed in the intensive care

00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:25.909
unit. The
chest x-rays showed fluid in the tissues of

00:34:25.909 --> 00:34:29.149
both lungs
that possibly was pneumonia and the heart

00:34:29.149 --> 00:34:32.710
was enlarged.
Erin's blood oxygen worsened during the night

00:34:32.710 --> 00:34:35.869
and she
suffered a cardiac arrest. But after a few

00:34:35.869 --> 00:34:39.109
minutes of
resuscitation, her heart was beating again

00:34:39.109 --> 00:34:42.629
and her
breathing continued to be supported by the

00:34:42.629 --> 00:34:46.810
machine.
Stunned, Glenda and I sat in the waiting area

00:34:46.810 --> 00:34:49.940
throughout
the night trying to remain supportive of each

00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:54.919
other. So
I won't go into more detail about all that

00:34:54.919 --> 00:34:58.500
just at the
moment. But Erin then had a horrendous course

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:03.920
but
survived. And required some heart surgeries

00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:09.030
and lots of
other things. Which make for a short but quite

00:35:09.030 --> 00:35:12.380
interesting series of anecdotes. And then,
I put in some

00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:18.180
photos including, of Erin as she graduated
from high

00:35:18.180 --> 00:35:21.140
school and later got married to her college
sweetheart.

00:35:21.140 --> 00:35:27.940
So it all turns out well. But those sorts
of surprises

00:35:27.940 --> 00:35:31.400
can overtake any family. And you need to be
prepared to

00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:37.039
deal with that. I had a younger daughter Carley
who was

00:35:37.039 --> 00:35:40.380
quite skilled and talented, loved to play
the piano and

00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:47.359
was quite good at it. And she, as a young
elementary

00:35:47.359 --> 00:35:50.040
student, she performed brilliantly several
complex

00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:53.099
classical pieces at her spring piano concert
so I was

00:35:53.099 --> 00:35:57.000
dismayed that during the following summer
months -- do she

00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000
was in elementary school--, she decided she
would not

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.450
practice the piano even one day. In September,
--so the

00:36:06.450 --> 00:36:09.830
summer had gone by -- I thought that I would
teach her a

00:36:09.830 --> 00:36:13.000
useful lesson about the importance of practice
and

00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:17.200
continued effort. I sat her down at a piano
and asked

00:36:17.200 --> 00:36:20.349
her to please play her classical pieces from
that prior

00:36:20.349 --> 00:36:26.329
spring concert. The smug look dropped from
my face when

00:36:26.329 --> 00:36:30.829
Carley effortlessly played them all nearly
perfectly from

00:36:30.829 --> 00:36:34.160
memory. So I'm not sure who learned the bigger
lesson

00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:39.080
that afternoon. Parents should observe carefully
and

00:36:39.080 --> 00:36:45.000
take to heart a real sense of wonder and awe
as their

00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.119
children grow and develop. Human beings are
truly

00:36:49.119 --> 00:36:54.780
amazing. Carley made transitions and so on.
And when

00:36:54.780 --> 00:36:58.400
she was about 16 years old, she joined a group
of high

00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.450
school students who were being trained by
the local

00:37:00.450 --> 00:37:04.890
police to go into a bar and order a drink.
If the

00:37:04.890 --> 00:37:09.160
student was not properly carded, and was actually
given a

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:12.799
drink, the police waiting outside planned
to move in and serve a

00:37:12.799 --> 00:37:19.900
citation. Although Carley was a fairly worldly
teenager, she actually did not have, at that

00:37:19.900 --> 00:37:24.790
time, any
experience ordering alcohol. The dozen or

00:37:24.790 --> 00:37:28.480
so students
were assembled for an informal training session

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.000
that
included a mock-up of a bar area with a policeman

00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:35.799
acting
as bartender so the students could practice

00:37:35.799 --> 00:37:39.700
what they
were supposed to say. The police instructor

00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:43.260
explained
that the bar would have hard liquor as well

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:47.619
as beer in
both bottles and draft. Carley was first at

00:37:47.619 --> 00:37:52.300
bat so she
somewhat self-consciously stepped up to the

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:57.839
mock
bartender, feigned a confident attitude, and

00:37:57.839 --> 00:38:01.600
in a loud
voice announced, "I'd like a bottle of draft

00:38:01.600 --> 00:38:06.510
beer,
please." [laughter] After a second of stunned

00:38:06.510 --> 00:38:09.960
silence, the
bartender and all of the police trainers roared

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.849
with
laughter. Blinking like a deer in the headlights

00:38:13.849 --> 00:38:16.720
and a
little red faced, Carley listened as they

00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.560
explained her
error. So that gives you some flavor of raising

00:38:21.560 --> 00:38:25.990
Carley.
When I was then a young faculty member in

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:30.960
Chicago, I had to
interview students who wanted to come and

00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:37.190
be interns and
trainees at our hospital. So I had different

00:38:37.190 --> 00:38:42.329
sorts of
interviews. Some were interviews for students

00:38:42.329 --> 00:38:45.520
who -- to
get more boots on the ground I would hire

00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:48.000
bright students
to come work in my research laboratory for

00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.339
the summer.
So I -- hospital paid for it so I was happy

00:38:53.339 --> 00:38:56.480
to hire them.
And they always made a contribution. It was

00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:01.960
fun to be
around bright young students. But there was

00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:08.510
an issue. I
had accepted a very bright young coed to join

00:39:08.510 --> 00:39:12.400
my lab for
a few weeks. But a month before her scheduled

00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:15.400
time, she
called me and explained sheepishly that she

00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:20.789
would have to
back out of the job. So this is her on the

00:39:20.789 --> 00:39:24.090
telephone.
She said, "I have just won an all expenses

00:39:24.090 --> 00:39:29.789
paid trip to
Switzerland for this summer." "Wow," I replied

00:39:29.789 --> 00:39:32.500
and I
expressed by sincere congratulations then

00:39:32.500 --> 00:39:38.051
I added just in
jest, "but if you stop to reconsider for a

00:39:38.051 --> 00:39:41.549
moment,
wouldn't you rather work in my lab in Chicago

00:39:41.549 --> 00:39:45.090
doing
fascinating biochemistry rather than traveling

00:39:45.090 --> 00:39:48.960
here and
there in Switzerland?" She was silent for

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:55.150
a moment. So
then I added, "and consider Chicago is actually

00:39:55.150 --> 00:40:01.431
exactly like
Switzerland only flatter". [laughter] Now

00:40:01.431 --> 00:40:07.289
realizing that I was just
teasing her we both had a good laugh together.

00:40:07.289 --> 00:40:08.880
In
addition to interviewing college students

00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:11.240
for summer
positions, I also interviewed individually

00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:15.849
each year about 20 medical
students who were applying to be interns in

00:40:15.849 --> 00:40:18.710
the
hospital's internal medicine training program.

00:40:18.710 --> 00:40:21.770
I really
enjoyed meeting these bright applicants and

00:40:21.770 --> 00:40:23.869
I was quite
interested to see what they were doing with

00:40:23.869 --> 00:40:27.529
their lives.
One of my particular points of interest was

00:40:27.529 --> 00:40:30.470
to analyze
the chronology of what they had listed on

00:40:30.470 --> 00:40:33.420
their
applications so I could understand what they

00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:36.860
had done
year by year since high school, a period of

00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.760
8 years for
these applicants. Sometimes a little probing

00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:44.051
would
disclose they had traveled in Europe for a

00:40:44.051 --> 00:40:49.180
year or worked
on an archaeological dig. During one interview

00:40:49.180 --> 00:40:52.980
with a
muscular young man, I was having difficulty

00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:56.550
understanding
what he had done for one 12-month period where

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:00.620
there
seemed to be a gap in his CV. He hemmed and

00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:04.260
hawed a bit
and I still had no clarity after a minute

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:11.150
or 2. "So just
tell me," I continued in a mildly stern tone.

00:41:11.150 --> 00:41:17.450
"Is that the
year that you were in jail?" His wide eyed

00:41:17.450 --> 00:41:23.400
expression
instantly told me --somewhat to my horror--

00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:27.839
that I must have
struck a nerve. But let me explain right now

00:41:27.839 --> 00:41:31.641
doctor he
blurted that it was not really my fault. We

00:41:31.641 --> 00:41:33.849
finished the
rest of the interview in a fairly routine

00:41:33.849 --> 00:41:36.810
manner but I'm
sure he walked out, wondered what amazing

00:41:36.810 --> 00:41:41.329
investigative techniques
had been employed by the hospital to discover

00:41:41.329 --> 00:41:45.380
his secret.
I'd only been joking, of course, when I mentioned

00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:52.060
jail. [clears throat] As
a young faculty member I had a research lab

00:41:52.060 --> 00:41:55.990
and I loved
my research and I loved publishing papers

00:41:55.990 --> 00:42:02.500
and so on, but
the grant process is very competitive and

00:42:02.500 --> 00:42:05.890
I got to the
point where I eventually just couldn't compete.

00:42:05.890 --> 00:42:09.680
I was a
pretty small operation. I did some good things

00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:13.220
working
on TSH and of course later, I came to work

00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:17.160
on Genzyme and
they make recombinant human TSH for thyroid

00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.430
cancer
patients. So I've had 30 years of experience

00:42:20.430 --> 00:42:23.460
working on
the biochemistry of TSH. So this was a really

00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.049
good fit
for me to move to Genzyme . But at the time,

00:42:27.049 --> 00:42:30.059
we were
under a lot of stress. And as we were unable

00:42:30.059 --> 00:42:34.869
to support
our research, find ways to do it, it was tough

00:42:34.869 --> 00:42:39.099
times in
academics. And it still is tough. I loved

00:42:39.099 --> 00:42:42.100
a joke that
circulated in our department at that time

00:42:42.100 --> 00:42:46.630
that seemed
quite apropos. There once was a remote monastery

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:50.220
of
monks whose goal was to pray three times a

00:42:50.220 --> 00:42:53.760
day for the
salvation of the world, help the poor a little

00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:56.550
if they
could, and teach young boys how to become

00:42:56.550 --> 00:43:00.230
monks. So this
was like a parallel situation to us in academics

00:43:00.230 --> 00:43:02.619
where we
weren't supposed to just see patients all

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:05.740
the time -- patients
patients patients -- but we were supposed

00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:09.510
to teach and do
research and other things just as the monks

00:43:09.510 --> 00:43:12.201
were supposed
to pray for the salvation of the world, help

00:43:12.201 --> 00:43:16.720
the poor,
teach young boys how to become monks. The

00:43:16.720 --> 00:43:20.290
monks took
pride in being very self-sufficient. So they

00:43:20.290 --> 00:43:23.060
tended
small gardens and eked out a living as best

00:43:23.060 --> 00:43:27.369
they could.
One day, a bright monk came to the superior

00:43:27.369 --> 00:43:30.289
with the idea
that if the monks sold some of the wine they

00:43:30.289 --> 00:43:33.329
made each
year, there would be more funds available

00:43:33.329 --> 00:43:37.840
to make life
more efficient for the community. Even the

00:43:37.840 --> 00:43:42.640
poor could be
helped a little more. The superior approved

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.220
the sale of
wine and over the next years, the monastery

00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:50.400
sold more and
more wine. Soon it became a booming business.

00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:54.680
But a new
superior became concerned as costs of business

00:43:54.680 --> 00:43:58.329
rose. And
more and more wine had to be sold to support

00:43:58.329 --> 00:44:01.770
the
infrastructure. The superior asked the monks

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:06.369
to pray
less each day, and teach less each day. And

00:44:06.369 --> 00:44:11.940
instead,
spend more time making wine. After a few more

00:44:11.940 --> 00:44:16.680
years, the
superior reached a crucial decision. In order

00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:20.680
to meet
the new quotas for the next year's wine deliveries,

00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:22.960
the
praying and the teaching would have to stop

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:27.070
completely. So
that was our joke at the University and then

00:44:27.070 --> 00:44:31.029
shortly
after that, I left the University and I joined

00:44:31.029 --> 00:44:36.369
as some
people said the dark side of the biotech industry

00:44:36.369 --> 00:44:40.609
where
we were trying to do clinical research to

00:44:40.609 --> 00:44:43.970
invent new
drugs to make money but also, of course, to

00:44:43.970 --> 00:44:48.130
help patients.
That sort of innovation is critical to have

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:56.230
new drugs
that will cure diseases. Okay. So we're coming

00:44:56.230 --> 00:45:03.270
to the
end. I put a chapter in about the importance

00:45:03.270 --> 00:45:08.030
of making
and saving money and investing. And it's not

00:45:08.030 --> 00:45:13.359
just to buy
the fancy cars. Having a little extra money

00:45:13.359 --> 00:45:18.940
in the bank
gives you the independence to go to the job

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.250
you want to
go to even if it's not the best-paying job

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:26.190
or to move to
the city that you want to move to even if

00:45:26.190 --> 00:45:30.430
it's not the
best-paying situation. It also allows you

00:45:30.430 --> 00:45:33.640
to tell your
boss, "that's a good idea but I actually see

00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:36.900
it this way
and so please consider looking at it this

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.210
way." Maybe
you don't have that issue at Google, but in

00:45:39.210 --> 00:45:43.180
many places
you do have that issue. And if you are not

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.800
just worried
every minute about what your job review is

00:45:46.800 --> 00:45:52.369
going to be
and so on it just gives you a little more

00:45:52.369 --> 00:45:56.579
independence in
terms of -- not that you're being insolent

00:45:56.579 --> 00:46:00.089
or a
troublemaker, but it just affects the way

00:46:00.089 --> 00:46:04.130
that you can
handle yourself in certain difficult situations.

00:46:04.130 --> 00:46:08.990
So the
the money is not the end. It's a tool. A very

00:46:08.990 --> 00:46:12.510
important
tool. And so, some people almost go the other

00:46:12.510 --> 00:46:16.289
direction
where they want to be completely non-materialistic

00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:20.039
and I'm
note going to save my money and so on but

00:46:20.039 --> 00:46:24.390
you have to
realize, as a responsible person in our culture,

00:46:24.390 --> 00:46:28.060
you have
to have savings and investments. And that

00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:33.960
gives you the
ability to be relatively independent of forces

00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:40.349
that are
trying to control you, okay? So I put -- of

00:46:40.349 --> 00:46:42.720
course, I've
counseled over the years many medical students

00:46:42.720 --> 00:46:45.289
and
trainees and they're worried about all the

00:46:45.289 --> 00:46:49.079
hard work.
They're worried about how I can make a living

00:46:49.079 --> 00:46:52.470
in the
future. What should I do? I have a girlfriend

00:46:52.470 --> 00:46:55.020
in San
Francisco. How is this going to work out with

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:58.430
my
training and so I would work with them. But

00:46:58.430 --> 00:47:00.490
one of the
key things I would always talk with them about

00:47:00.490 --> 00:47:07.090
was saving
and investing and trying to save money. And

00:47:07.090 --> 00:47:12.180
I loved the
auto biography of Benjamin Franklin. So let

00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:21.319
me just read
a little bit from Chapter 19 about that. So

00:47:21.319 --> 00:47:24.700
I've made
the widely known points earlier about saving

00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.220
and
investing sensibly. They're the true keys

00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:31.230
to
accumulating wealth. But there are also other

00:47:31.230 --> 00:47:34.519
important
tidbits to mention. One must study hard, work

00:47:34.519 --> 00:47:37.809
hard, and
make the proper connections so as to optimize

00:47:37.809 --> 00:47:40.890
one's
earning potential. An entertaining and very

00:47:40.890 --> 00:47:43.790
readable
account along those lines has been given to

00:47:43.790 --> 00:47:47.750
us by
Benjamin Franklin in his autobiography. Although

00:47:47.750 --> 00:47:51.000
this
selection might sound formidable, his autobiography

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.920
is
actually a slim paperback volume that can

00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:58.000
be purchased about 10
dollars new. He wrote the first part when

00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.770
he was -- and
then he was interrupted so he completed the

00:48:01.770 --> 00:48:05.650
last part in
old age. Actually many scholars believe the

00:48:05.650 --> 00:48:10.440
book was not
finished. The somewhat old fashioned language

00:48:10.440 --> 00:48:14.609
takes only
ten pagers or so to get used to and the authenticity

00:48:14.609 --> 00:48:19.190
is
well-worth this minor inconvenience. Frugality

00:48:19.190 --> 00:48:22.930
is but
one of many topics addressed. He was willing

00:48:22.930 --> 00:48:26.640
to leave
home, travel to many places, expertise at

00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.530
reading and
writing was vital, he was willing to serve

00:48:29.530 --> 00:48:33.440
on committees
and do other unpopular jobs of that kind since

00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:36.830
he actually then
could have a direct hand in shaping outcomes

00:48:36.830 --> 00:48:40.680
of important
relevant questions. Notable was Franklin's

00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.099
skill at
being in the right place so as to be the obvious

00:48:44.099 --> 00:48:48.230
choice
when some task had to be done for a fee such

00:48:48.230 --> 00:48:52.230
as printing
up paperwork for the legislature. His personal

00:48:52.230 --> 00:48:56.660
reflections
on trying to be a good person and his record-keeping

00:48:56.660 --> 00:49:01.069
of
sins are delightful accounts. Many educators

00:49:01.069 --> 00:49:04.000
would
assert this is one book that every American

00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.630
should read
or anyone of any nationality really and it

00:49:07.630 --> 00:49:10.559
could be read
in just a few days or during a couple of airplane

00:49:10.559 --> 00:49:20.450
rides. And so,
I list that book in an appendix that's on

00:49:20.450 --> 00:49:25.690
Page 173 of
what I would recommend at least for people

00:49:25.690 --> 00:49:30.970
interested in
science and medicine as key books that might

00:49:30.970 --> 00:49:33.640
be of
interest for let's say holiday reading or

00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:37.089
summer time
reading and they include the Double Helix

00:49:37.089 --> 00:49:45.980
by James
Watson. A great book is the Discoveries by

00:49:45.980 --> 00:49:50.140
Alan
Lightman. The Discovery of Insulin by Michael

00:49:50.140 --> 00:49:54.849
Bliss is a
good book. A collection of little funny anecdotes

00:49:54.849 --> 00:49:58.430
that are each
about a page long is Eurekas and Euphorias

00:49:58.430 --> 00:50:02.530
by Gratzer. That's a
great book especially for airplane reading

00:50:02.530 --> 00:50:08.500
because each anecdote is like a page,by famous
scientists, Tesla,

00:50:08.500 --> 00:50:15.420
Einstein. I like space and things. So I put
some books

00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:24.299
on about the great inner planetary missions,
sending robots out to other planets. Amir

00:50:24.299 --> 00:50:28.529
D. Aczel,
who I think is in New England, wrote a book

00:50:28.529 --> 00:50:33.650
called the
Mystery of the Aleph. There's a book at the

00:50:33.650 --> 00:50:39.210
end, When Bad Things
Happen to Good People, which I bought and

00:50:39.210 --> 00:50:43.550
read when my
first daughter was very, very sick. And of

00:50:43.550 --> 00:50:45.850
course was
having many bad things happen to her. So what

00:50:45.850 --> 00:50:51.200
does it
mean when bad things happen to good people?

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.160
And in
closing, I'm going to leave a little time

00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:58.430
for some
questions. I added a chapter that's only three

00:50:58.430 --> 00:51:03.940
pages.
But these are my closing thoughts. And of

00:51:03.940 --> 00:51:08.040
course, this
book was intended to be about chess, yes,

00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:12.500
and there are
lots of examples about chess games and strategies

00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:16.640
for
trying to trick and win some chess games.

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:20.760
But the book
was intended to be more about chess. I go

00:51:20.760 --> 00:51:24.960
on to say
anecdotes can be entertaining but also instructive

00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:28.559
and
helpful. My hope is that a thoughtful reader

00:51:28.559 --> 00:51:31.700
might glean
practical advice from my ramblings that will

00:51:31.700 --> 00:51:36.490
prove useful in other areas of life
. And I actually have another appendix

00:51:36.490 --> 00:51:39.809
where I give specific advice because I've
worked with

00:51:39.809 --> 00:51:42.950
medical students, trainees and of course,
two daughters

00:51:42.950 --> 00:51:46.839
and so I tell them to wear sunscreen, wear
a hat, take

00:51:46.839 --> 00:51:50.470
calcium and vitamin D every day. Money is
very

00:51:50.470 --> 00:51:53.859
important, but don't be overly materialistic.
Money is a

00:51:53.859 --> 00:51:59.190
tool, not an end and so on. So I put lots
of things that

00:51:59.190 --> 00:52:03.140
I hope people -- young people -- would see
value in some

00:52:03.140 --> 00:52:05.980
of those things just like for my recommended
books. You

00:52:05.980 --> 00:52:09.829
can't read all these books, but if you pick
three or four

00:52:09.829 --> 00:52:12.650
of them to look at. These are not my books.
They're

00:52:12.650 --> 00:52:17.200
books I recommend that I think would be of
real value to

00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.170
bright young people who are interested in
science or

00:52:20.170 --> 00:52:25.010
medicine. I talk about, you know, what does
it mean if

00:52:25.010 --> 00:52:28.990
we're faced with a world full of suffering
and which many

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:33.920
people claim, I mean, that there's no ultimate
meaning to

00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.430
any of this anyway. So what's the point of
all this?

00:52:37.430 --> 00:52:43.900
Why don't we just go out and get drunk? So
I quote Isaac

00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:48.769
Newton. And also one of my favorite authors
Loren Eiseley

00:52:48.769 --> 00:52:52.869
who probably if you pick one book off my list
to read and

00:52:52.869 --> 00:52:56.630
it's easy to read. It's not highly technical.
It's an

00:52:56.630 --> 00:53:01.730
old book a couple of decades ago. The Immense
Journey is

00:53:01.730 --> 00:53:10.089
a very easy book to read. So I guess the autobiography
of Benjamin Franklin and the Immense Journey

00:53:10.089 --> 00:53:14.270
by Loren
Eiseley. Are very thoughtfully written entertaining

00:53:14.270 --> 00:53:18.130
books. So Newton was a brilliant, creative,
a loner, a

00:53:18.130 --> 00:53:24.220
supremely hard worker who was willing to pursue
scientific calculations day and night without

00:53:24.220 --> 00:53:29.510
food or
sleep. But he also was concerned about ultimate

00:53:29.510 --> 00:53:35.290
understandings. And in his treatise Optics
published in

00:53:35.290 --> 00:53:40.450
1794 he criticized other scientists who were
trying to

00:53:40.450 --> 00:53:44.670
banish God, the first cause as he viewed it,
from a proper

00:53:44.670 --> 00:53:48.440
understanding of the world. Newton writes
"latter

00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:53.290
philosophers", meaning our current thinkers
now, "banish the

00:53:53.290 --> 00:53:57.381
consideration of a cause out of natural philosophy,"
he

00:53:57.381 --> 00:54:00.950
wrote. Feigning hypotheses for explaining
all things

00:54:00.950 --> 00:54:05.770
mechanically and referring all other causes
to metaphysics.

00:54:05.770 --> 00:54:08.809
But Newton viewed this purely mechanical approach
as

00:54:08.809 --> 00:54:12.829
flawed. Newton instead wanted to deduce causes
from

00:54:12.829 --> 00:54:16.570
effects till we come to the very first cause.
He was

00:54:16.570 --> 00:54:19.920
comfortable with gravity's mysterious action
at a

00:54:19.920 --> 00:54:22.039
distance, for example, and was content to
describe how

00:54:22.039 --> 00:54:28.269
gravity acted in mathematical detail while
admitting the precise mechanisms whereby gravity

00:54:28.269 --> 00:54:33.860
exerts its effects, remain completely unexplained.
Newton

00:54:33.860 --> 00:54:36.640
wanted not merely to unfold the mechanism
of the world

00:54:36.640 --> 00:54:42.140
but he also wanted to learn, "whence is it
that nature doth nothing in vain and whence

00:54:42.140 --> 00:54:47.789
arises all that order
order and beauty which we see in the world."

00:54:47.789 --> 00:54:49.609
And
then Eiseley, I'll just close on a couple

00:54:49.609 --> 00:54:56.079
quotes from him. Eiseley
who was a 20th century anthropologist and

00:54:56.079 --> 00:55:02.160
naturalist, echoes some of
Newton's longings for ultimate understanding.

00:55:02.160 --> 00:55:05.890
Eiseley
writes there's no logical reason for the existence

00:55:05.890 --> 00:55:10.501
of a
snow flake any more than for evolution. It

00:55:10.501 --> 00:55:14.349
is an
apparition from the final world which contains,

00:55:14.349 --> 00:55:18.509
if
anything contains, the explanation of men

00:55:18.509 --> 00:55:23.970
and cat fish and
green leaves. Eiseley was not enamored of

00:55:23.970 --> 00:55:28.390
organized
religion but his keen scientific mind also

00:55:28.390 --> 00:55:34.210
encompassed a
profound mystical sense. Quote, "Man is not

00:55:34.210 --> 00:55:39.549
as other creatures," he
observed. "Without the sense of the holy,

00:55:39.549 --> 00:55:44.370
without
compassion, his brain can become a gray stalking

00:55:44.370 --> 00:55:51.640
horror.
The divisor of Belsen". So I would like to

00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:54.819
close
now to entertain a couple of questions. I

00:55:54.819 --> 00:55:58.911
would
encourage you to, you know, take a copy. Share

00:55:58.911 --> 00:56:04.240
it with a
friend. Buy six more copies, you know, I make

00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:10.490
I think 59
cents for each copy that's sold. I've tried

00:56:10.490 --> 00:56:14.450
to write a
book under the guise of a chess book that

00:56:14.450 --> 00:56:19.579
also has, I
think, messages that really would be valuable

00:56:19.579 --> 00:56:23.779
to let's say
college age students or young trainees that

00:56:23.779 --> 00:56:27.119
deserve, even
if they don't like what I write, if they'll

00:56:27.119 --> 00:56:30.150
look at the
appendix and look at some of the books I recommend

00:56:30.150 --> 00:56:34.069
I
think there would be a lot of value here for

00:56:34.069 --> 00:56:37.590
a pretty
slim book. So let me close there. Thank you

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:41.609
again for
your attention. I'd be happy to answer any

00:56:41.609 --> 00:56:42.609
questions.

00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:42.969
[Applause]
