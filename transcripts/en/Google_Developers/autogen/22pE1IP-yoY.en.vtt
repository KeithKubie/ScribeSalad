here
it's almost as excited as this guy I

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:01.159
it's almost as excited as this guy I
 

00:01:01.159 --> 00:01:03.340
it's almost as excited as this guy I
don't know if I'm as excited because I

can't jump that high in the air but but
 

00:01:05.570 --> 00:01:08.620
can't jump that high in the air but but
as said dart 1.0 is out so that's great

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:08.630
as said dart 1.0 is out so that's great
 

00:01:08.630 --> 00:01:10.480
as said dart 1.0 is out so that's great
it means you've got a stable library to

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:10.490
it means you've got a stable library to
 

00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:12.940
it means you've got a stable library to
play with and we're gonna actually you

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:12.950
play with and we're gonna actually you
 

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:15.310
play with and we're gonna actually you
know show you the benefits right now so

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:15.320
know show you the benefits right now so
 

00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.810
know show you the benefits right now so
Brad is going to go into a demo of a

00:01:16.810 --> 00:01:16.820
Brad is going to go into a demo of a
 

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.030
Brad is going to go into a demo of a
very simple application that will go

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:19.040
very simple application that will go
 

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.200
very simple application that will go
through soup to nuts yeah thanks I'd say

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:23.210
through soup to nuts yeah thanks I'd say
 

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:24.820
through soup to nuts yeah thanks I'd say
and so I think one of the interesting

00:01:24.820 --> 00:01:24.830
and so I think one of the interesting
 

00:01:24.830 --> 00:01:27.430
and so I think one of the interesting
things to just add on about a dart 1.0

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:27.440
things to just add on about a dart 1.0
 

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:27.790
things to just add on about a dart 1.0
right

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:27.800
right
 

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.620
right
the language is stable the API stable

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:29.630
the language is stable the API stable
 

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:31.390
the language is stable the API stable
they're working on performance these are

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:31.400
they're working on performance these are
 

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.130
they're working on performance these are
all great things but a language is more

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:33.140
all great things but a language is more
 

00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:35.980
all great things but a language is more
than just the syntax you know as Seth

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
than just the syntax you know as Seth
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.830
than just the syntax you know as Seth
said it's an ecosystem so if you're

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:38.840
said it's an ecosystem so if you're
 

00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:40.090
said it's an ecosystem so if you're
gonna be developing in dart you want to

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:40.100
gonna be developing in dart you want to
 

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:41.530
gonna be developing in dart you want to
know what technologies are available

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:41.540
know what technologies are available
 

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.230
know what technologies are available
what tools what frameworks and so these

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:44.240
what tools what frameworks and so these
 

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:45.730
what tools what frameworks and so these
are the things we're gonna go to and to

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:45.740
are the things we're gonna go to and to
 

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.340
are the things we're gonna go to and to
do that we wanted to like like max had

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:48.350
do that we wanted to like like max had
 

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.170
do that we wanted to like like max had
build an app soup-to-nuts

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:50.180
build an app soup-to-nuts
 

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.840
build an app soup-to-nuts
and go through the code client server

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:52.850
and go through the code client server
 

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.410
and go through the code client server
database and so I'm just gonna click on

00:01:56.410 --> 00:01:56.420
database and so I'm just gonna click on
 

00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:00.219
database and so I'm just gonna click on
this so we'll jump out and prepare to be

00:02:00.219 --> 00:02:00.229
this so we'll jump out and prepare to be
 

00:02:00.229 --> 00:02:03.570
this so we'll jump out and prepare to be
amazed by an awesome URL shortener so

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.580
amazed by an awesome URL shortener so
 

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:05.830
amazed by an awesome URL shortener so
well pretty much just works as you would

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:05.840
well pretty much just works as you would
 

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.830
well pretty much just works as you would
expect if you I'm going to type in a URL

00:02:09.830 --> 00:02:09.840
expect if you I'm going to type in a URL
 

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.770
expect if you I'm going to type in a URL
and I'm gonna click shorten and it's

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:12.780
and I'm gonna click shorten and it's
 

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:14.240
and I'm gonna click shorten and it's
gonna shorten it and then I'm gonna

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:14.250
gonna shorten it and then I'm gonna
 

00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:17.570
gonna shorten it and then I'm gonna
click it and you know it it goes and of

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:17.580
click it and you know it it goes and of
 

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:19.070
click it and you know it it goes and of
course the ironic thing is the shortened

00:02:19.070 --> 00:02:19.080
course the ironic thing is the shortened
 

00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:21.199
course the ironic thing is the shortened
URL was actually I think longer than

00:02:21.199 --> 00:02:21.209
URL was actually I think longer than
 

00:02:21.209 --> 00:02:24.500
URL was actually I think longer than
google.com but that's you know yeah not

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:24.510
google.com but that's you know yeah not
 

00:02:24.510 --> 00:02:25.940
google.com but that's you know yeah not
a big deal if that's the worst thing

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:25.950
a big deal if that's the worst thing
 

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.470
a big deal if that's the worst thing
that happens the demo then I think we're

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:27.480
that happens the demo then I think we're
 

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:29.930
that happens the demo then I think we're
doing ok yeah and so you know just to

00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:29.940
doing ok yeah and so you know just to
 

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:31.729
doing ok yeah and so you know just to
describe how that we did a client-side

00:02:31.729 --> 00:02:31.739
describe how that we did a client-side
 

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:33.860
describe how that we did a client-side
app in dart we did the server-side code

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:33.870
app in dart we did the server-side code
 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:35.720
app in dart we did the server-side code
in dart and we're actually persisting

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:35.730
in dart and we're actually persisting
 

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.670
in dart and we're actually persisting
hashing the URLs and persisting those in

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:37.680
hashing the URLs and persisting those in
 

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.680
hashing the URLs and persisting those in
a Redis key value store so that when you

00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:39.690
a Redis key value store so that when you
 

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.020
a Redis key value store so that when you
visit the URL it's pulling the hash out

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:42.030
visit the URL it's pulling the hash out
 

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:45.470
visit the URL it's pulling the hash out
and sending you to the link all right so

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:45.480
and sending you to the link all right so
 

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.039
and sending you to the link all right so
let's jump back in and I kind of already

00:02:49.039 --> 00:02:49.049
let's jump back in and I kind of already
 

00:02:49.049 --> 00:02:50.570
let's jump back in and I kind of already
talked about that what we'll learn but

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:50.580
talked about that what we'll learn but
 

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:52.400
talked about that what we'll learn but
client server-side app we're going to

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:52.410
client server-side app we're going to
 

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:53.780
client server-side app we're going to
talk about testing we're going to talk

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:53.790
talk about testing we're going to talk
 

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.370
talk about testing we're going to talk
about a little bit about deploying sub

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:55.380
about a little bit about deploying sub
 

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:58.370
about a little bit about deploying sub
language features some tools a lot of

00:02:58.370 --> 00:02:58.380
language features some tools a lot of
 

00:02:58.380 --> 00:02:59.930
language features some tools a lot of
people here from a Java background so I

00:02:59.930 --> 00:02:59.940
people here from a Java background so I
 

00:02:59.940 --> 00:03:01.250
people here from a Java background so I
know you'll care about the tools things

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
know you'll care about the tools things
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:08.210
know you'll care about the tools things
like continuous integration etc

00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:08.220
 

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.120
so there's a couple of things you'll

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
so there's a couple of things you'll
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.220
so there's a couple of things you'll
notice that in on the client we're going

00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:13.230
notice that in on the client we're going
 

00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.280
notice that in on the client we're going
to start there and there's actually the

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:16.290
to start there and there's actually the
 

00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:18.350
to start there and there's actually the
way that you include dart into your web

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:18.360
way that you include dart into your web
 

00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:20.900
way that you include dart into your web
application is very similar to you know

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:20.910
application is very similar to you know
 

00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:22.940
application is very similar to you know
it's very familiar as to how you include

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:22.950
it's very familiar as to how you include
 

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.940
it's very familiar as to how you include
JavaScript so there's a script include

00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:25.950
JavaScript so there's a script include
 

00:03:25.950 --> 00:03:27.860
JavaScript so there's a script include
you see the type is actually application

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:27.870
you see the type is actually application
 

00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:32.570
you see the type is actually application
dart and what allows us to to use this

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:32.580
dart and what allows us to to use this
 

00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:35.090
dart and what allows us to to use this
in a in a browser that's outside of

in a in a browser that's outside of
dartium which seth went over in terms of

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:38.160
dartium which seth went over in terms of
 

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.420

two key files we've got the HTML file
 

00:03:57.780 --> 00:03:59.900
two key files we've got the HTML file
and then we've got your your dart script

you can do this if you're familiar with
 

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:57.890
you can do this if you're familiar with
jQuery it's you'll feel right at home

00:04:57.890 --> 00:04:57.900

dart uses a query selector so that

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:00.600
dart uses a query selector so that
 

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.360
dart uses a query selector so that
you're able to actually you know grab

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:02.370
you're able to actually you know grab
 

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:04.159
you're able to actually you know grab
what you need to and attach the event

00:05:04.159 --> 00:05:04.169

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:08.340
 

00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.790
all right so we've wired up the on-click

00:05:11.790 --> 00:05:11.800
all right so we've wired up the on-click
 

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:13.620
all right so we've wired up the on-click
this is just a quick look at the the

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:13.630
this is just a quick look at the the
 

00:05:13.630 --> 00:05:15.570
this is just a quick look at the the

00:05:15.580 --> 00:05:16.950
onclick function again if you've coded
in JavaScript this should look extremely

00:05:16.950 --> 00:05:16.960
in JavaScript this should look extremely
 

00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:20.210
in JavaScript this should look extremely
familiar we're creating the HTTP request

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:20.220
familiar we're creating the HTTP request
 

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.190
familiar we're creating the HTTP request
we have the onreadystatechange so when

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:23.200
we have the onreadystatechange so when
 

00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.390
we have the onreadystatechange so when
we send the request we can get a

we send the request we can get a
 

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.890
we send the request we can get a
response back of course there's some

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:25.900
response back of course there's some

we just didn't stuff it all into these

00:05:30.090 --> 00:05:30.100
we just didn't stuff it all into these
 

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:32.700
we just didn't stuff it all into these
slides and then when we get the response

00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:32.710
slides and then when we get the response
 

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:35.760

the form calling this show text method

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:37.780
the form calling this show text method
 

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.620
the form calling this show text method

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:40.630
method and then there's one thing I
 

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.970
method and then there's one thing I
wanted to cover because you guys are

00:05:41.970 --> 00:05:41.980
wanted to cover because you guys are
 

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:43.110
wanted to cover because you guys are
going through dart you're gonna see some

00:05:43.110 --> 00:05:43.120
going through dart you're gonna see some
 

00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:45.000
going through dart you're gonna see some
new syntax things and some people had

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.010
new syntax things and some people had
 

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.220
new syntax things and some people had
some questions like what's what's going

00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:47.230
some questions like what's what's going
 

00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:49.020
some questions like what's what's going
on with this thing right here this

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:49.030
on with this thing right here this
 

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.440
on with this thing right here this
underscore and really it's just the

00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:52.450
underscore and really it's just the
 

00:05:52.450 --> 00:05:54.660
underscore and really it's just the
listener is invoking this function on

00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:54.670
listener is invoking this function on
 

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.430
listener is invoking this function on
callback in it would typically be

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:56.440
callback in it would typically be
 

00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.060
callback in it would typically be
passing in event handler data and we're

00:06:00.060 --> 00:06:00.070
passing in event handler data and we're
 

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:01.650
passing in event handler data and we're
just gonna ignore it and so that's what

00:06:01.650 --> 00:06:01.660
just gonna ignore it and so that's what
 

00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:02.820
just gonna ignore it and so that's what
we're doing with that underscores we

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:02.830
we're doing with that underscores we
 

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:04.800
we're doing with that underscores we
just only care about it and so you'll

00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:04.810
just only care about it and so you'll
 

00:06:04.810 --> 00:06:06.600
just only care about it and so you'll
see that from time to time in dart code

00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:06.610
see that from time to time in dart code
 

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:08.760
see that from time to time in dart code
and maybe even further in this demo and

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:08.770
and maybe even further in this demo and
 

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:09.990
and maybe even further in this demo and
so as we see these types of things we'll

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.000
so as we see these types of things we'll
 

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:15.800
so as we see these types of things we'll
try to point out what they mean

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:15.810
 

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.230
so Seth mentioned this as well this is

00:06:19.230 --> 00:06:19.240
so Seth mentioned this as well this is
 

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:21.780
so Seth mentioned this as well this is
one of the really cool things that we

00:06:21.780 --> 00:06:21.790
one of the really cool things that we
 

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:24.030
one of the really cool things that we
found about dart was the syntactic sugar

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:24.040
found about dart was the syntactic sugar
 

00:06:24.040 --> 00:06:26.670
found about dart was the syntactic sugar
it takes a lot of the you know

00:06:26.670 --> 00:06:26.680
it takes a lot of the you know
 

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.650
it takes a lot of the you know
boilerplate stuff that you're used to

00:06:28.650 --> 00:06:28.660
boilerplate stuff that you're used to
 

00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.000
boilerplate stuff that you're used to
kind of putting together and having to

00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:30.010
kind of putting together and having to
 

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:31.770
kind of putting together and having to
piece together in other languages and

00:06:31.770 --> 00:06:31.780
piece together in other languages and
 

00:06:31.780 --> 00:06:34.500
piece together in other languages and
and boils it down so that you're not you

00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:34.510
and boils it down so that you're not you
 

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:36.030
and boils it down so that you're not you
know you're not using as much you're not

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:36.040
know you're not using as much you're not
 

00:06:36.040 --> 00:06:38.040
know you're not using as much you're not
thinking through as much and string

00:06:38.040 --> 00:06:38.050
thinking through as much and string
 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.409
thinking through as much and string
interpolation is is a great example of

00:06:40.409 --> 00:06:40.419
interpolation is is a great example of
 

00:06:40.419 --> 00:06:45.870
interpolation is is a great example of
this the thing that I found actually

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:45.880
this the thing that I found actually
 

00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:49.230
this the thing that I found actually
most you know fascinating was the

00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:49.240
most you know fascinating was the
 

00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.409
most you know fascinating was the
Cascades so Seth also covered that I'm

00:06:52.409 --> 00:06:52.419
Cascades so Seth also covered that I'm
 

00:06:52.419 --> 00:06:54.060
Cascades so Seth also covered that I'm
gonna gush a little bit more about this

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:54.070
gonna gush a little bit more about this
 

00:06:54.070 --> 00:06:57.030
gonna gush a little bit more about this
because it's this is where you know as

00:06:57.030 --> 00:06:57.040
because it's this is where you know as
 

00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.250
because it's this is where you know as
as developers you're gonna spend you

00:06:59.250 --> 00:06:59.260
as developers you're gonna spend you
 

00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.570
as developers you're gonna spend you
know 90 percent of your time is spent

00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:00.580
know 90 percent of your time is spent
 

00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:02.719
know 90 percent of your time is spent
maintaining stuff not writing it and

00:07:02.719 --> 00:07:02.729
maintaining stuff not writing it and
 

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:06.840
maintaining stuff not writing it and
anything that you write is inherently

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:06.850
anything that you write is inherently
 

00:07:06.850 --> 00:07:08.730
anything that you write is inherently
shared with other people you work on

00:07:08.730 --> 00:07:08.740
shared with other people you work on
 

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:11.250
shared with other people you work on
teams and even yourself right you know a

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:11.260
teams and even yourself right you know a
 

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:12.719
teams and even yourself right you know a
few months later after you write

00:07:12.719 --> 00:07:12.729
few months later after you write
 

00:07:12.729 --> 00:07:14.490
few months later after you write
something and go back to it you might

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:14.500
something and go back to it you might
 

00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.409
something and go back to it you might
not quite remember exactly what it did

00:07:16.409 --> 00:07:16.419
not quite remember exactly what it did
 

00:07:16.419 --> 00:07:19.140
not quite remember exactly what it did
so this is you know anything that you

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:19.150
so this is you know anything that you
 

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.850
so this is you know anything that you
can do with a language to make it more

00:07:20.850 --> 00:07:20.860
can do with a language to make it more
 

00:07:20.860 --> 00:07:23.250
can do with a language to make it more
readable make it more like prose it's a

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:23.260
readable make it more like prose it's a
 

00:07:23.260 --> 00:07:24.270
readable make it more like prose it's a
great thing

great thing
 

00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.520
great thing
you know programming is poetry you're

00:07:26.520 --> 00:07:26.530
you know programming is poetry you're
 

00:07:26.530 --> 00:07:29.129
you know programming is poetry you're
all writers and this is this makes your

00:07:29.129 --> 00:07:29.139
all writers and this is this makes your
 

00:07:29.139 --> 00:07:31.110
all writers and this is this makes your
job easier it's it's absolutely

fantastic and it really helps in
 

00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:35.520
fantastic and it really helps in
maintaining things you know in the

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:35.530
maintaining things you know in the
 

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:38.310
maintaining things you know in the
future so for this particular just to

00:07:38.310 --> 00:07:38.320
future so for this particular just to
 

00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.940
future so for this particular just to
explain what's going on in the code the

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:40.950
explain what's going on in the code the
 

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.270
explain what's going on in the code the
the URL short is you know the the at the

00:07:45.270 --> 00:07:45.280
the URL short is you know the the at the
 

00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:46.800
the URL short is you know the the at the
anchor tag that we're actually going to

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810
anchor tag that we're actually going to
 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:48.719
anchor tag that we're actually going to
update the attributes when the show text

00:07:48.719 --> 00:07:48.729
update the attributes when the show text
 

00:07:48.729 --> 00:07:52.680
update the attributes when the show text
function is is invoked and just like in

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:52.690
function is is invoked and just like in
 

00:07:52.690 --> 00:07:54.270
function is is invoked and just like in
the code that you saw before we're

00:07:54.270 --> 00:07:54.280
the code that you saw before we're
 

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.770
the code that you saw before we're
taking all of the things that we want to

00:07:55.770 --> 00:07:55.780
taking all of the things that we want to
 

00:07:55.780 --> 00:07:57.210
taking all of the things that we want to
change about it we want to put the new

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:57.220
change about it we want to put the new
 

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:59.250
change about it we want to put the new
you know href in there we want to change

00:07:59.250 --> 00:07:59.260
you know href in there we want to change
 

00:07:59.260 --> 00:08:01.290
you know href in there we want to change
its name so that you see what the actual

00:08:01.290 --> 00:08:01.300
its name so that you see what the actual
 

00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.290
its name so that you see what the actual
short hashed link is and we're doing it

00:08:04.290 --> 00:08:04.300
short hashed link is and we're doing it
 

00:08:04.300 --> 00:08:06.029
short hashed link is and we're doing it
with Cascades so it's very very easy to

00:08:06.029 --> 00:08:06.039
with Cascades so it's very very easy to
 

00:08:06.039 --> 00:08:10.260
with Cascades so it's very very easy to
read and maintain later alright so now

00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:10.270
read and maintain later alright so now
 

00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.200
read and maintain later alright so now
what I'd like to do is just jump back to

00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:13.210
what I'd like to do is just jump back to
 

00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.920
what I'd like to do is just jump back to
the demo who would have thought we can

00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:16.930
the demo who would have thought we can
 

00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:19.869
the demo who would have thought we can
actually demo more with this

00:08:19.869 --> 00:08:19.879
actually demo more with this
 

00:08:19.879 --> 00:08:24.129
actually demo more with this
let's go we're gonna go to yahoo.com and

00:08:24.129 --> 00:08:24.139
let's go we're gonna go to yahoo.com and
 

00:08:24.139 --> 00:08:27.619
let's go we're gonna go to yahoo.com and
we generated the hash and boom we didn't

00:08:27.619 --> 00:08:27.629
we generated the hash and boom we didn't
 

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:30.860
we generated the hash and boom we didn't
redirect so what happened what broke

00:08:30.860 --> 00:08:30.870
redirect so what happened what broke
 

00:08:30.870 --> 00:08:33.350
redirect so what happened what broke
and so let's jump back into the pitch

00:08:33.350 --> 00:08:33.360
and so let's jump back into the pitch
 

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:36.379
and so let's jump back into the pitch
and you know we can kind of further

00:08:36.379 --> 00:08:36.389
and you know we can kind of further
 

00:08:36.389 --> 00:08:38.360
and you know we can kind of further
analyze what happened here well we

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:38.370
analyze what happened here well we
 

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.430
analyze what happened here well we
didn't type the HTTP we just typed the

00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440
didn't type the HTTP we just typed the
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.889
didn't type the HTTP we just typed the
www and it turns out when the server

00:08:42.889 --> 00:08:42.899
www and it turns out when the server
 

00:08:42.899 --> 00:08:45.379
www and it turns out when the server
tried to do the redirect without the

00:08:45.379 --> 00:08:45.389
tried to do the redirect without the
 

00:08:45.389 --> 00:08:48.110
tried to do the redirect without the
HTTP it wasn't able to do so and those

00:08:48.110 --> 00:08:48.120
HTTP it wasn't able to do so and those
 

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:49.519
HTTP it wasn't able to do so and those
are kind of like the mundane details

00:08:49.519 --> 00:08:49.529
are kind of like the mundane details
 

00:08:49.529 --> 00:08:51.590
are kind of like the mundane details
that is developers sometimes we forget

00:08:51.590 --> 00:08:51.600
that is developers sometimes we forget
 

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.660
that is developers sometimes we forget
about and so we thought that was a nice

00:08:53.660 --> 00:08:53.670
about and so we thought that was a nice
 

00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:57.319
about and so we thought that was a nice
segue in to the next topic which is

00:08:57.319 --> 00:08:57.329
segue in to the next topic which is
 

00:08:57.329 --> 00:09:03.740
segue in to the next topic which is
gonna be unit tests so every time you

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:03.750
gonna be unit tests so every time you
 

00:09:03.750 --> 00:09:05.240
gonna be unit tests so every time you
kind of come across one of these things

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:05.250
kind of come across one of these things
 

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:06.949
kind of come across one of these things
that might not crop you know cross your

00:09:06.949 --> 00:09:06.959
that might not crop you know cross your
 

00:09:06.959 --> 00:09:08.269
that might not crop you know cross your
mind earlier when you develop something

00:09:08.269 --> 00:09:08.279
mind earlier when you develop something
 

00:09:08.279 --> 00:09:10.400
mind earlier when you develop something
every time you know somebody finds a bug

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:10.410
every time you know somebody finds a bug
 

00:09:10.410 --> 00:09:12.470
every time you know somebody finds a bug
you want to write that unit test so that

00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:12.480
you want to write that unit test so that
 

00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:14.389
you want to write that unit test so that
you make sure you have coverage going

00:09:14.389 --> 00:09:14.399
you make sure you have coverage going
 

00:09:14.399 --> 00:09:17.030
you make sure you have coverage going
forward this is starting from the client

it's a simple command to actually format
 

00:09:49.470 --> 00:09:51.889
it's a simple command to actually format
the results of the unit test and in a

00:09:51.889 --> 00:09:51.899
the results of the unit test and in a
 

00:09:51.899 --> 00:09:56.240
the results of the unit test and in a
nice way in the browser and finally the

00:09:56.240 --> 00:09:56.250
nice way in the browser and finally the
 

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:58.790
nice way in the browser and finally the
the meat of this is the test itself so

00:09:58.790 --> 00:09:58.800
the meat of this is the test itself so
 

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.769
the meat of this is the test itself so
you know what we said when you know

00:10:00.769 --> 00:10:00.779
you know what we said when you know
 

00:10:00.779 --> 00:10:02.509
you know what we said when you know
somebody came in with a bug report and

because we forgot the protocol we now

00:10:08.630 --> 00:10:08.640
because we forgot the protocol we now
 

00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.160
because we forgot the protocol we now
write a couple of tests to make sure

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:10.170
write a couple of tests to make sure
 

00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:11.689
write a couple of tests to make sure
that we have that coverage going forward

00:10:11.689 --> 00:10:11.699
that we have that coverage going forward
 

00:10:11.699 --> 00:10:13.790
that we have that coverage going forward
we check that it's a you know is valid

00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:13.800
we check that it's a you know is valid
 

00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.740
we check that it's a you know is valid
URL is working and that we get

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:15.750
URL is working and that we get
 

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.379
URL is working and that we get
everything you know stuff the protocol

00:10:18.379 --> 00:10:18.389
everything you know stuff the protocol
 

00:10:18.389 --> 00:10:23.420
everything you know stuff the protocol
and if people do not include that and so

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:23.430
and if people do not include that and so
 

00:10:23.430 --> 00:10:26.090
and if people do not include that and so
when you run the the test itself this is

00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:26.100
when you run the the test itself this is
 

00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:28.370
when you run the the test itself this is
the output that you get it shows you

00:10:28.370 --> 00:10:28.380
the output that you get it shows you
 

00:10:28.380 --> 00:10:30.139
the output that you get it shows you
that you know all your tests have passed

00:10:30.139 --> 00:10:30.149

one thing I love about this is that I

00:10:42.079 --> 00:10:42.089
one thing I love about this is that I
 

00:10:42.089 --> 00:10:44.420
one thing I love about this is that I
can run my tests directly against a real

00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:44.430
can run my tests directly against a real
 

00:10:44.430 --> 00:10:46.850

UI and so I think this is awesome that

00:10:55.249 --> 00:10:55.259
UI and so I think this is awesome that
 

00:10:55.259 --> 00:10:57.290

when I write my unit tests against my

00:10:57.290 --> 00:10:57.300
when I write my unit tests against my
 

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.449
when I write my unit tests against my
web page I could hit an actual real DOM

00:10:59.449 --> 00:10:59.459
web page I could hit an actual real DOM
 

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:01.220
web page I could hit an actual real DOM
and I don't have to you know write all

00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:01.230
and I don't have to you know write all
 

00:11:01.230 --> 00:11:04.730
and I don't have to you know write all
that extra boilerplate mocking code so

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:04.740
that extra boilerplate mocking code so
 

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:06.470
that extra boilerplate mocking code so
so like Brad said you know this is

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:06.480
so like Brad said you know this is
 

00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:08.629
so like Brad said you know this is
fantastic but there's and it's a really

00:11:08.629 --> 00:11:08.639
fantastic but there's and it's a really
 

00:11:08.639 --> 00:11:10.759
fantastic but there's and it's a really
great to see everything kind of included

00:11:10.759 --> 00:11:10.769
great to see everything kind of included
 

00:11:10.769 --> 00:11:13.730
great to see everything kind of included
in you know dartium and the dart editor

00:11:13.730 --> 00:11:13.740
in you know dartium and the dart editor
 

00:11:13.740 --> 00:11:16.220
in you know dartium and the dart editor
itself it's it's very nice workflow you

00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:16.230
itself it's it's very nice workflow you
 

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.660
itself it's it's very nice workflow you
don't have to jump to a lot of different

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:17.670
don't have to jump to a lot of different
 

00:11:17.670 --> 00:11:19.309
don't have to jump to a lot of different
places everything's contained but

00:11:19.309 --> 00:11:19.319
places everything's contained but
 

00:11:19.319 --> 00:11:20.569
places everything's contained but
there's gonna be points in time when you

00:11:20.569 --> 00:11:20.579
there's gonna be points in time when you
 

00:11:20.579 --> 00:11:22.670
there's gonna be points in time when you
want to do things you know you want to

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:22.680
want to do things you know you want to
 

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:23.780
want to do things you know you want to
script them out you want to do them

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:23.790
script them out you want to do them
 

00:11:23.790 --> 00:11:25.550
script them out you want to do them
faster you're not gonna do them you'll

00:11:25.550 --> 00:11:25.560
faster you're not gonna do them you'll
 

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.160
faster you're not gonna do them you'll
manually you know buy control running

00:11:28.160 --> 00:11:28.170
manually you know buy control running
 

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:30.470
manually you know buy control running
something and so that's what brings us

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:30.480
something and so that's what brings us
 

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:34.069
something and so that's what brings us
into the next topic which is headless

00:11:34.069 --> 00:11:34.079
into the next topic which is headless
 

00:11:34.079 --> 00:11:38.360

browser testing and this is really done

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:38.370
browser testing and this is really done
 

00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:41.150
browser testing and this is really done
you know dart provides a very nice

00:11:41.150 --> 00:11:41.160
you know dart provides a very nice
 

00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:45.559
you know dart provides a very nice
utility to take care of this it's a it's

00:11:45.559 --> 00:11:45.569
utility to take care of this it's a it's
 

00:11:45.569 --> 00:11:47.240
utility to take care of this it's a it's
a headless browser with full dom like

00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:47.250
a headless browser with full dom like
 

00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:48.829
a headless browser with full dom like

00:11:48.829 --> 00:11:48.839
brad said and it's faster than running
 

00:11:48.839 --> 00:11:51.650
brad said and it's faster than running
you know something like HTTP unit and

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:51.660
you know something like HTTP unit and
 

00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:54.710
you know something like HTTP unit and
selenium so anything that we can do with

00:11:54.710 --> 00:11:54.720
selenium so anything that we can do with
 

00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:57.050
selenium so anything that we can do with
a browser we can do in the headless

00:11:57.050 --> 00:11:57.060
a browser we can do in the headless
 

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:59.900
a browser we can do in the headless
browser so we use content shell which is

00:11:59.900 --> 00:11:59.910
browser so we use content shell which is
 

00:11:59.910 --> 00:12:02.120
browser so we use content shell which is
the tool itself and the way that we do

00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:02.130
the tool itself and the way that we do
 

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.189
the tool itself and the way that we do
this is we call this with an argument of

00:12:04.189 --> 00:12:04.199
this is we call this with an argument of
 

00:12:04.199 --> 00:12:06.170
this is we call this with an argument of
dump render tree and you'll see that the

00:12:06.170 --> 00:12:06.180
dump render tree and you'll see that the
 

00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:07.879
dump render tree and you'll see that the
file that it's pointing to is actually

00:12:07.879 --> 00:12:07.889
file that it's pointing to is actually
 

00:12:07.889 --> 00:12:09.499
file that it's pointing to is actually
the same you know that we invoke that

00:12:09.499 --> 00:12:09.509
the same you know that we invoke that
 

00:12:09.509 --> 00:12:11.030
the same you know that we invoke that
you saw on the previous slide with

00:12:11.030 --> 00:12:11.040
you saw on the previous slide with
 

00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.360
you saw on the previous slide with
within the browser itself and when we

00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:14.370
within the browser itself and when we
 

00:12:14.370 --> 00:12:16.819
within the browser itself and when we
call that we see that same content to

00:12:16.819 --> 00:12:16.829
call that we see that same content to
 

00:12:16.829 --> 00:12:19.309
call that we see that same content to
you know all our tests past so we're

00:12:19.309 --> 00:12:19.319
you know all our tests past so we're
 

00:12:19.319 --> 00:12:20.809
you know all our tests past so we're
good to go but it's happening you know

00:12:20.809 --> 00:12:20.819
good to go but it's happening you know
 

00:12:20.819 --> 00:12:22.730
good to go but it's happening you know
on the command line so it can be done

00:12:22.730 --> 00:12:22.740
on the command line so it can be done
 

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:25.370
on the command line so it can be done
much quicker and and built into our

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:25.380
much quicker and and built into our
 

00:12:25.380 --> 00:12:28.850
much quicker and and built into our
build steps later on

00:12:28.850 --> 00:12:28.860
 

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.640
would have been negative against like

00:12:31.640 --> 00:12:31.650
would have been negative against like
 

00:12:31.650 --> 00:12:34.310
would have been negative against like
let's say you had a faulty faulty

00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:34.320
let's say you had a faulty faulty
 

00:12:34.320 --> 00:12:35.730
let's say you had a faulty faulty
webpage

00:12:35.730 --> 00:12:35.740
webpage
 

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:39.480
webpage
so so you mean in terms of like you want

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:39.490
so so you mean in terms of like you want
 

00:12:39.490 --> 00:12:42.030
so so you mean in terms of like you want
to test like like errors like you expect

00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:42.040
to test like like errors like you expect
 

00:12:42.040 --> 00:12:49.830
to test like like errors like you expect
errors yeah so yeah I think do we have

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:49.840
errors yeah so yeah I think do we have
 

00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:51.240
errors yeah so yeah I think do we have
an example of that I don't think we have

00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:51.250
an example of that I don't think we have
 

00:12:51.250 --> 00:12:52.950
an example of that I don't think we have
I don't think we have an example of it

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:52.960
I don't think we have an example of it
 

00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.720
I don't think we have an example of it
but it's something that you you could do

00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:54.730
but it's something that you you could do
 

00:12:54.730 --> 00:12:55.680
but it's something that you you could do
it's just all depends on how you

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:55.690
it's just all depends on how you
 

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.790
it's just all depends on how you
structure your test so yeah we have the

00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800
structure your test so yeah we have the
 

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.470
structure your test so yeah we have the
things that there's there's more code

00:13:01.470 --> 00:13:01.480
things that there's there's more code
 

00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:02.670
things that there's there's more code
behind the scenes it's actually

00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:02.680
behind the scenes it's actually
 

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:04.170
behind the scenes it's actually
something that we didn't prepare for

00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:04.180
something that we didn't prepare for
 

00:13:04.180 --> 00:13:07.050
something that we didn't prepare for
this particular application but we can

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:07.060
this particular application but we can
 

00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:08.070
this particular application but we can
definitely add that into the github

00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:08.080
definitely add that into the github
 

00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.530
definitely add that into the github
projects and show it as an example

00:13:10.530 --> 00:13:10.540
projects and show it as an example
 

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:12.150
projects and show it as an example
that's something that you'd like to see

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:12.160
that's something that you'd like to see
 

00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.670
that's something that you'd like to see
yeah I'm sure there are plenty of

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:14.680
yeah I'm sure there are plenty of
 

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:16.350
yeah I'm sure there are plenty of
examples and maybe Seth can answer that

00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:16.360
examples and maybe Seth can answer that
 

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.730
examples and maybe Seth can answer that
one when we're when we're done you can

00:13:17.730 --> 00:13:17.740
one when we're when we're done you can
 

00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.530
one when we're when we're done you can
talk to that cuz I know some of the dart

00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:19.540
talk to that cuz I know some of the dart
 

00:13:19.540 --> 00:13:21.750
talk to that cuz I know some of the dart
team there they're running hundreds of

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:21.760
team there they're running hundreds of
 

00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:24.420
team there they're running hundreds of
these types of tests and analyzing out

00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:24.430
these types of tests and analyzing out
 

00:13:24.430 --> 00:13:25.680
these types of tests and analyzing out
to us so I'm sure they're doing those

00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:25.690
to us so I'm sure they're doing those
 

00:13:25.690 --> 00:13:27.750
to us so I'm sure they're doing those
types of tests but basically anything

00:13:27.750 --> 00:13:27.760
types of tests but basically anything
 

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:29.280
types of tests but basically anything
you can do from a dart unit test you

00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:29.290
you can do from a dart unit test you
 

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.600
you can do from a dart unit test you
you're running in the head in headless

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:30.610
you're running in the head in headless
 

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:31.650
you're running in the head in headless
mode so if you're familiar with like a

00:13:31.650 --> 00:13:31.660

phantom Jas or something like that it's

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:33.880
phantom Jas or something like that it's
 

00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.240
phantom Jas or something like that it's
it's that for Dart

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:36.250
it's that for Dart
 

00:13:36.250 --> 00:13:38.010
it's that for Dart
maybe a little more primitive but

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:38.020
maybe a little more primitive but
 

00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:42.060
maybe a little more primitive but
hopefully it'll evolve over time so now

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:42.070
hopefully it'll evolve over time so now
 

00:13:42.070 --> 00:13:43.580
hopefully it'll evolve over time so now

00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:24.070
there's tons of frameworks like this
 

00:14:24.070 --> 00:14:26.790
there's tons of frameworks like this
that make it really easy to deal with

00:14:26.790 --> 00:14:26.800
that make it really easy to deal with
 

00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:29.520
that make it really easy to deal with
with URL routing and stuff like that and

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:29.530
with URL routing and stuff like that and
 

00:14:29.530 --> 00:14:31.080
with URL routing and stuff like that and
so what we're doing here is we're

00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:31.090
so what we're doing here is we're
 

00:14:31.090 --> 00:14:34.170
so what we're doing here is we're
invoking start what you see is this this

00:14:34.170 --> 00:14:34.180
invoking start what you see is this this
 

00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:36.870
invoking start what you see is this this
public web that is we're pointing it to

00:14:36.870 --> 00:14:36.880
public web that is we're pointing it to
 

00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.640
public web that is we're pointing it to
the server where we're serving our

00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:38.650
the server where we're serving our
 

00:14:38.650 --> 00:14:40.560
the server where we're serving our
static content out of our CSS files our

00:14:40.560 --> 00:14:40.570

dart script
 

00:14:42.649 --> 00:14:44.619
dart script
and then this is where we're declaring

00:14:44.619 --> 00:14:44.629
and then this is where we're declaring
 

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:47.230
and then this is where we're declaring
that we want to handle this route so the

00:14:47.230 --> 00:14:47.240
that we want to handle this route so the
 

00:14:47.240 --> 00:14:48.609
that we want to handle this route so the
code whether you have the dot dot dot

00:14:48.609 --> 00:14:48.619
code whether you have the dot dot dot
 

00:14:48.619 --> 00:14:50.799
code whether you have the dot dot dot
that will get invoked any time we do a

00:14:50.799 --> 00:14:50.809
that will get invoked any time we do a
 

00:14:50.809 --> 00:14:52.600
that will get invoked any time we do a
post to that route which is of course

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:52.610
post to that route which is of course
 

00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.179
post to that route which is of course
important because we're gonna be posting

00:14:54.179 --> 00:14:54.189
important because we're gonna be posting
 

00:14:54.189 --> 00:14:57.400
important because we're gonna be posting
a URL to this route in order to get back

00:14:57.400 --> 00:14:57.410
a URL to this route in order to get back
 

00:14:57.410 --> 00:15:00.069
a URL to this route in order to get back
a hash and so let's kind of quickly look

00:15:00.069 --> 00:15:00.079
a hash and so let's kind of quickly look
 

00:15:00.079 --> 00:15:03.369
a hash and so let's kind of quickly look
at what we would fill this with should

00:15:03.369 --> 00:15:03.379
at what we would fill this with should
 

00:15:03.379 --> 00:15:05.889
at what we would fill this with should
be pretty straightforward we're getting

00:15:05.889 --> 00:15:05.899
be pretty straightforward we're getting
 

00:15:05.899 --> 00:15:08.379
be pretty straightforward we're getting
the URL from from the request we're

00:15:08.379 --> 00:15:08.389
the URL from from the request we're
 

00:15:08.389 --> 00:15:10.749
the URL from from the request we're
hashing it using a simple shop hatch

00:15:10.749 --> 00:15:10.759
hashing it using a simple shop hatch
 

00:15:10.759 --> 00:15:12.669
hashing it using a simple shop hatch
right built into the dart library

00:15:12.669 --> 00:15:12.679
right built into the dart library
 

00:15:12.679 --> 00:15:14.499
right built into the dart library
awesome dart has a standard library has

00:15:14.499 --> 00:15:14.509
awesome dart has a standard library has
 

00:15:14.509 --> 00:15:15.819
awesome dart has a standard library has
all this great stuff in it

00:15:15.819 --> 00:15:15.829
all this great stuff in it
 

00:15:15.829 --> 00:15:17.530
all this great stuff in it
so I didn't have to write a shot house

00:15:17.530 --> 00:15:17.540
so I didn't have to write a shot house
 

00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.030
so I didn't have to write a shot house
hashing algorithm or anything like that

00:15:19.030 --> 00:15:19.040
hashing algorithm or anything like that
 

00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:20.799
hashing algorithm or anything like that
I was able to just take it right out of

00:15:20.799 --> 00:15:20.809
I was able to just take it right out of
 

00:15:20.809 --> 00:15:23.769
I was able to just take it right out of
the library and then we're using a Redis

00:15:23.769 --> 00:15:23.779
the library and then we're using a Redis
 

00:15:23.779 --> 00:15:25.389
the library and then we're using a Redis
client obviously I don't show how you

00:15:25.389 --> 00:15:25.399
client obviously I don't show how you
 

00:15:25.399 --> 00:15:26.889
client obviously I don't show how you
started it up here I didn't that was

00:15:26.889 --> 00:15:26.899
started it up here I didn't that was
 

00:15:26.899 --> 00:15:28.840
started it up here I didn't that was
necessary but we're doing something

00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:28.850
necessary but we're doing something
 

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:30.400
necessary but we're doing something
simple we're setting the hash is the key

00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:30.410
simple we're setting the hash is the key
 

00:15:30.410 --> 00:15:33.730
simple we're setting the hash is the key
the URL is the value and of course this

00:15:33.730 --> 00:15:33.740
the URL is the value and of course this
 

00:15:33.740 --> 00:15:35.919
the URL is the value and of course this
is asynchronous and so I Seth mentioned

00:15:35.919 --> 00:15:35.929
is asynchronous and so I Seth mentioned
 

00:15:35.929 --> 00:15:37.509
is asynchronous and so I Seth mentioned
this is where futures come into play and

00:15:37.509 --> 00:15:37.519
this is where futures come into play and
 

00:15:37.519 --> 00:15:41.350
this is where futures come into play and
so we're saying when this is done we're

00:15:41.350 --> 00:15:41.360
so we're saying when this is done we're
 

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.720
so we're saying when this is done we're
gonna invoke this function here and

00:15:43.720 --> 00:15:43.730
gonna invoke this function here and
 

00:15:43.730 --> 00:15:46.389
gonna invoke this function here and
we're gonna say respond with the hash

00:15:46.389 --> 00:15:46.399
we're gonna say respond with the hash
 

00:15:46.399 --> 00:15:49.059
we're gonna say respond with the hash
and so I mean stuff kind of touched on

00:15:49.059 --> 00:15:49.069
and so I mean stuff kind of touched on
 

00:15:49.069 --> 00:15:50.829
and so I mean stuff kind of touched on
it but it's kind of nice to be able to

00:15:50.829 --> 00:15:50.839
it but it's kind of nice to be able to
 

00:15:50.839 --> 00:15:53.199
it but it's kind of nice to be able to
use this future syntax especially when

00:15:53.199 --> 00:15:53.209
use this future syntax especially when
 

00:15:53.209 --> 00:15:55.629
use this future syntax especially when
you get multiple of these vens you avoid

00:15:55.629 --> 00:15:55.639
you get multiple of these vens you avoid
 

00:15:55.639 --> 00:15:57.400
you get multiple of these vens you avoid
that callback health so we really like

00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:57.410
that callback health so we really like
 

00:15:57.410 --> 00:15:59.199
that callback health so we really like
that as we were programming and actually

00:15:59.199 --> 00:15:59.209
that as we were programming and actually
 

00:15:59.209 --> 00:16:00.910
that as we were programming and actually
this is a simplified version we have

00:16:00.910 --> 00:16:00.920
this is a simplified version we have
 

00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.160
this is a simplified version we have
like an over engineered like hashing one

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:03.170
like an over engineered like hashing one
 

00:16:03.170 --> 00:16:05.530
like an over engineered like hashing one
that uses much more than the actual

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:05.540
that uses much more than the actual
 

00:16:05.540 --> 00:16:11.199
that uses much more than the actual
github repo and then this is just you

00:16:11.199 --> 00:16:11.209
github repo and then this is just you
 

00:16:11.209 --> 00:16:13.780
github repo and then this is just you
know so we've persisted it to torretta

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:13.790
know so we've persisted it to torretta
 

00:16:13.790 --> 00:16:15.790
know so we've persisted it to torretta
so we persisted the hash and now we need

00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:15.800
so we persisted the hash and now we need
 

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.169
so we persisted the hash and now we need
the redirect function so when someone

00:16:17.169 --> 00:16:17.179
the redirect function so when someone
 

00:16:17.179 --> 00:16:21.970
the redirect function so when someone
visits the shortened URL we're gonna

00:16:21.970 --> 00:16:21.980
visits the shortened URL we're gonna
 

00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.989
visits the shortened URL we're gonna
look it up just simply with Redis get

00:16:25.989 --> 00:16:25.999
look it up just simply with Redis get
 

00:16:25.999 --> 00:16:27.669
look it up just simply with Redis get
we're gonna get the hash again this is

00:16:27.669 --> 00:16:27.679
we're gonna get the hash again this is
 

00:16:27.679 --> 00:16:29.829
we're gonna get the hash again this is
asynchronous so we're using a future

00:16:29.829 --> 00:16:29.839
asynchronous so we're using a future
 

00:16:29.839 --> 00:16:31.780
asynchronous so we're using a future
we're getting the value and we're

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:31.790
we're getting the value and we're
 

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:34.480
we're getting the value and we're
redirecting so again very very simple

00:16:34.480 --> 00:16:34.490
redirecting so again very very simple
 

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:40.860
redirecting so again very very simple
readable code in Dart we love it

00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:40.870
 

00:16:40.870 --> 00:16:43.829
all right so so just like we tested the

00:16:43.829 --> 00:16:43.839
all right so so just like we tested the
 

00:16:43.839 --> 00:16:46.320
all right so so just like we tested the
client we're gonna test the server as

00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:46.330
client we're gonna test the server as
 

00:16:46.330 --> 00:16:48.240
client we're gonna test the server as
well and what's great about running the

00:16:48.240 --> 00:16:48.250
well and what's great about running the
 

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:50.100
well and what's great about running the
same code on the server and the client

00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:50.110
same code on the server and the client
 

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.810
same code on the server and the client
is that things are gonna feel very

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:51.820
is that things are gonna feel very
 

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.680
is that things are gonna feel very
familiar so like we did before we're

00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:55.690
familiar so like we did before we're
 

00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.390
familiar so like we did before we're
gonna pull in the unit test library and

00:16:57.390 --> 00:16:57.400
gonna pull in the unit test library and
 

00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.340
gonna pull in the unit test library and
we're gonna do something a little bit

00:16:59.340 --> 00:16:59.350
we're gonna do something a little bit
 

00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:00.480
we're gonna do something a little bit
different because we're not going to be

00:17:00.480 --> 00:17:00.490
different because we're not going to be
 

00:17:00.490 --> 00:17:03.300
different because we're not going to be
testing you know the HTML we're actually

00:17:03.300 --> 00:17:03.310
testing you know the HTML we're actually
 

00:17:03.310 --> 00:17:04.770
testing you know the HTML we're actually
going to use the virtual machine in this

00:17:04.770 --> 00:17:04.780
going to use the virtual machine in this
 

00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:10.470
going to use the virtual machine in this
instance and to test that the you know

00:17:10.470 --> 00:17:10.480
instance and to test that the you know
 

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:12.630
instance and to test that the you know
the hash is working properly we first

00:17:12.630 --> 00:17:12.640
the hash is working properly we first
 

00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.370
the hash is working properly we first
check to see that it's just returning

00:17:14.370 --> 00:17:14.380
check to see that it's just returning
 

00:17:14.380 --> 00:17:15.960
check to see that it's just returning
something we just want to make sure that

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:15.970
something we just want to make sure that
 

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.510
something we just want to make sure that
it's not null and then we know what the

00:17:18.510 --> 00:17:18.520
it's not null and then we know what the
 

00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:21.120
it's not null and then we know what the
specific hash will be it's a simple hash

00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:21.130
specific hash will be it's a simple hash
 

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.870
specific hash will be it's a simple hash
so we're gonna test for that specific

00:17:23.870 --> 00:17:23.880
so we're gonna test for that specific
 

00:17:23.880 --> 00:17:29.190
so we're gonna test for that specific
hash and to run it all you do is in the

00:17:29.190 --> 00:17:29.200
hash and to run it all you do is in the
 

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.890
hash and to run it all you do is in the

know test files name is and you can see

00:17:34.110 --> 00:17:34.120
know test files name is and you can see
 

00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.060
know test files name is and you can see
you know whether it passes or fails and

00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.070
you know whether it passes or fails and
 

00:17:36.070 --> 00:17:42.780
you know whether it passes or fails and
in this case you know it passes all

00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:42.790
in this case you know it passes all
 

00:17:42.790 --> 00:17:45.240
in this case you know it passes all
right so set touch on this so we won't

00:17:45.240 --> 00:17:45.250
right so set touch on this so we won't
 

00:17:45.250 --> 00:17:46.350
right so set touch on this so we won't
really we don't have a lot to say about

00:17:46.350 --> 00:17:46.360
really we don't have a lot to say about
 

00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:48.230
really we don't have a lot to say about
it because it's so simple deployment

00:17:48.230 --> 00:17:48.240

virtual machine on the fly very simple

00:18:05.510 --> 00:18:05.520
virtual machine on the fly very simple
 

00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:08.850
virtual machine on the fly very simple
Heroku add-ons we add a Redis datastore

00:18:08.850 --> 00:18:08.860
Heroku add-ons we add a Redis datastore
 

00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:11.010
Heroku add-ons we add a Redis datastore
and you know within seconds we had a red

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:11.020
and you know within seconds we had a red
 

00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.750
and you know within seconds we had a red
ass database and then we just get push

00:18:12.750 --> 00:18:12.760
ass database and then we just get push
 

00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.930
ass database and then we just get push
and so it's a great way if you're just

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:15.940
and so it's a great way if you're just
 

00:18:15.940 --> 00:18:17.490
and so it's a great way if you're just
getting started with dart and you're

00:18:17.490 --> 00:18:17.500
getting started with dart and you're
 

00:18:17.500 --> 00:18:18.780
getting started with dart and you're
building a cool app and you want to show

00:18:18.780 --> 00:18:18.790
building a cool app and you want to show
 

00:18:18.790 --> 00:18:21.570
building a cool app and you want to show
it to people definitely try out Heroku

00:18:21.570 --> 00:18:21.580
it to people definitely try out Heroku
 

00:18:21.580 --> 00:18:24.630
it to people definitely try out Heroku
and if you google the dart build pack

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:24.640
and if you google the dart build pack
 

00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:26.970
and if you google the dart build pack
there's instructions for a little more

00:18:26.970 --> 00:18:26.980
there's instructions for a little more
 

00:18:26.980 --> 00:18:30.030
there's instructions for a little more
in-depth for getting us all working

00:18:30.030 --> 00:18:30.040
in-depth for getting us all working
 

00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:35.010
in-depth for getting us all working
all right so just a question to

00:18:35.010 --> 00:18:35.020
all right so just a question to
 

00:18:35.020 --> 00:18:35.610
all right so just a question to
everybody

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:35.620
everybody
 

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:37.500
everybody
does anybody know about how many you

00:18:37.500 --> 00:18:37.510
does anybody know about how many you
 

00:18:37.510 --> 00:18:39.870
does anybody know about how many you
know browser and OS combinations there

00:18:39.870 --> 00:18:39.880
know browser and OS combinations there
 

00:18:39.880 --> 00:18:43.890
know browser and OS combinations there
are out there a million that's that's I

00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:43.900
are out there a million that's that's I
 

00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.330
are out there a million that's that's I
think that's pretty close but another

00:18:45.330 --> 00:18:45.340
think that's pretty close but another
 

00:18:45.340 --> 00:18:48.990
think that's pretty close but another
guess here let's go with let's go with

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:49.000
guess here let's go with let's go with
 

00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:52.800
guess here let's go with let's go with
many many well as many permutations as

00:18:52.800 --> 00:18:52.810
many many well as many permutations as
 

00:18:52.810 --> 00:18:59.150
many many well as many permutations as
possible so there what's that

00:18:59.150 --> 00:18:59.160
possible so there what's that
 

00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.340
possible so there what's that
includes different versions too yeah

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:02.350
includes different versions too yeah
 

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.760
includes different versions too yeah
what so so you see this is quickly you

00:19:05.760 --> 00:19:05.770
what so so you see this is quickly you
 

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.220
what so so you see this is quickly you
know spiraling out of control there's at

00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:08.230
know spiraling out of control there's at
 

00:19:08.230 --> 00:19:10.770
know spiraling out of control there's at
least over 200 different combinations of

00:19:10.770 --> 00:19:10.780
least over 200 different combinations of
 

00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:13.470
least over 200 different combinations of
I'll say the modern one so not not every

00:19:13.470 --> 00:19:13.480
I'll say the modern one so not not every
 

00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:15.630
I'll say the modern one so not not every
single one I was just trying to get as

00:19:15.630 --> 00:19:15.640
single one I was just trying to get as
 

00:19:15.640 --> 00:19:27.260
single one I was just trying to get as
many you know numbers as I could but

00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:27.270
 

00:19:27.270 --> 00:19:30.930
yeah that's there there's some cutoff

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:30.940
yeah that's there there's some cutoff
 

00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:33.570
yeah that's there there's some cutoff
date so but for the modern ones let's

00:19:33.570 --> 00:19:33.580
date so but for the modern ones let's
 

00:19:33.580 --> 00:19:35.340
date so but for the modern ones let's
say that it's it's over 200 about

00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:35.350
say that it's it's over 200 about
 

00:19:35.350 --> 00:19:37.170
say that it's it's over 200 about
approximately the different combinations

00:19:37.170 --> 00:19:37.180
approximately the different combinations
 

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:39.180
approximately the different combinations
and so when we're when we're creating

00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:39.190
and so when we're when we're creating
 

00:19:39.190 --> 00:19:42.780
and so when we're when we're creating
you know web applications are all of us

00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:42.790
you know web applications are all of us
 

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:44.070
you know web applications are all of us
going out and testing all those

00:19:44.070 --> 00:19:44.080
going out and testing all those
 

00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:47.510
going out and testing all those
combinations you know ourselves manually

00:19:47.510 --> 00:19:47.520
combinations you know ourselves manually
 

00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:52.170
combinations you know ourselves manually
probably not so that brings us to our

00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:52.180
probably not so that brings us to our
 

00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:53.820
probably not so that brings us to our
next segment which is cross-browser

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:53.830
next segment which is cross-browser
 

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:58.680
next segment which is cross-browser
testing a selenium probably everybody's

00:19:58.680 --> 00:19:58.690
testing a selenium probably everybody's
 

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:00.540
testing a selenium probably everybody's
pretty familiar with you know selenium

00:20:00.540 --> 00:20:00.550
pretty familiar with you know selenium
 

00:20:00.550 --> 00:20:02.760
pretty familiar with you know selenium
IDE you can record tests within your

00:20:02.760 --> 00:20:02.770
IDE you can record tests within your
 

00:20:02.770 --> 00:20:05.550
IDE you can record tests within your
browser selenium server you run those

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:05.560
browser selenium server you run those
 

00:20:05.560 --> 00:20:08.310
browser selenium server you run those
tests we're actually you know darts got

00:20:08.310 --> 00:20:08.320
tests we're actually you know darts got
 

00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:10.440
tests we're actually you know darts got
capabilities where you can actually do

00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:10.450
capabilities where you can actually do
 

00:20:10.450 --> 00:20:12.360
capabilities where you can actually do
the scripting for the tests within dart

00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:12.370
the scripting for the tests within dart
 

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:15.360
the scripting for the tests within dart
so again you're keeping all of your code

00:20:15.360 --> 00:20:15.370
so again you're keeping all of your code
 

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:17.940
so again you're keeping all of your code
in in one place and using the same

00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:17.950
in in one place and using the same
 

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:21.990
in in one place and using the same
language and here it's we just picked

00:20:21.990 --> 00:20:22.000
language and here it's we just picked
 

00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:23.550
language and here it's we just picked
that one sample but basically we're

00:20:23.550 --> 00:20:23.560
that one sample but basically we're
 

00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:25.980
that one sample but basically we're
creating the webdriver here in selenium

00:20:25.980 --> 00:20:25.990
creating the webdriver here in selenium
 

00:20:25.990 --> 00:20:28.980
creating the webdriver here in selenium
and we're saying I want to test on an

00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:28.990
and we're saying I want to test on an
 

00:20:28.990 --> 00:20:31.740
and we're saying I want to test on an
Android Browser picture multiple

00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:31.750
Android Browser picture multiple
 

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:33.270
Android Browser picture multiple
iterations of this you know you've got

00:20:33.270 --> 00:20:33.280
iterations of this you know you've got
 

00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:36.840
iterations of this you know you've got
Firefox Chrome etc everything that you

00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:36.850
Firefox Chrome etc everything that you
 

00:20:36.850 --> 00:20:38.340
Firefox Chrome etc everything that you
could that you could stuff in you know

00:20:38.340 --> 00:20:38.350
could that you could stuff in you know
 

00:20:38.350 --> 00:20:41.350
could that you could stuff in you know
add as many as you need to

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:41.360
 

00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.960
and then the actual so that's that's

00:20:44.960 --> 00:20:44.970
and then the actual so that's that's
 

00:20:44.970 --> 00:20:49.460
and then the actual so that's that's
setting up the actual test itself is you

00:20:49.460 --> 00:20:49.470
setting up the actual test itself is you
 

00:20:49.470 --> 00:20:50.330
setting up the actual test itself is you
know what we're doing is we're basically

00:20:50.330 --> 00:20:50.340
know what we're doing is we're basically
 

00:20:50.340 --> 00:20:52.700
know what we're doing is we're basically
you know finding again you know we're

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:52.710
you know finding again you know we're
 

00:20:52.710 --> 00:20:55.430
you know finding again you know we're
finding an element we're doing something

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:55.440
finding an element we're doing something
 

00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:56.930
finding an element we're doing something
to that element and what's what's neat

00:20:56.930 --> 00:20:56.940
to that element and what's what's neat
 

00:20:56.940 --> 00:20:59.360
to that element and what's what's neat
is we're actually back to the future'

00:20:59.360 --> 00:20:59.370
is we're actually back to the future'
 

00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:00.830
is we're actually back to the future'
syntax that we saw earlier

00:21:00.830 --> 00:21:00.840
syntax that we saw earlier
 

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:04.010
syntax that we saw earlier
so again if this is a simplified version

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:04.020
so again if this is a simplified version
 

00:21:04.020 --> 00:21:05.960
so again if this is a simplified version
but we're basically nesting you know

00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:05.970
but we're basically nesting you know
 

00:21:05.970 --> 00:21:09.280
but we're basically nesting you know
we're able to stagger a whole lot of

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:09.290
we're able to stagger a whole lot of
 

00:21:09.290 --> 00:21:12.370
we're able to stagger a whole lot of
asynchronous calls to actually achieve

00:21:12.370 --> 00:21:12.380
asynchronous calls to actually achieve
 

00:21:12.380 --> 00:21:15.380
asynchronous calls to actually achieve
the the testing that we want and right

00:21:15.380 --> 00:21:15.390
the the testing that we want and right
 

00:21:15.390 --> 00:21:16.970
the the testing that we want and right
in the middle of everything it smack dab

00:21:16.970 --> 00:21:16.980
in the middle of everything it smack dab
 

00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:18.290
in the middle of everything it smack dab
in the middle of everything we can

00:21:18.290 --> 00:21:18.300
in the middle of everything we can
 

00:21:18.300 --> 00:21:20.360
in the middle of everything we can
actually you know throw in an

00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:20.370
actually you know throw in an
 

00:21:20.370 --> 00:21:22.640
actually you know throw in an
expectation so that's that's your test

00:21:22.640 --> 00:21:22.650
expectation so that's that's your test
 

00:21:22.650 --> 00:21:24.380
expectation so that's that's your test
right there so you you can you can have

00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:24.390
right there so you you can you can have
 

00:21:24.390 --> 00:21:26.120
right there so you you can you can have
multiple ones of these chained off of

00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:26.130
multiple ones of these chained off of
 

00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.000
multiple ones of these chained off of
each other and it's just it's just a

00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:29.010
each other and it's just it's just a
 

00:21:29.010 --> 00:21:30.920
each other and it's just it's just a
nice way to actually you know again

00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:30.930
nice way to actually you know again
 

00:21:30.930 --> 00:21:32.810
nice way to actually you know again
format that's put it in a very readable

00:21:32.810 --> 00:21:32.820
format that's put it in a very readable
 

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:35.150
format that's put it in a very readable
format and and execute a lot of

00:21:35.150 --> 00:21:35.160
format and and execute a lot of
 

00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.860
format and and execute a lot of
different different tests in a lot of

00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:36.870
different different tests in a lot of
 

00:21:36.870 --> 00:21:40.720
different different tests in a lot of
different expectations so yes selenium

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:40.730
different expectations so yes selenium
 

00:21:40.730 --> 00:21:45.200
different expectations so yes selenium
directly in dart is awesome so and you

00:21:45.200 --> 00:21:45.210
directly in dart is awesome so and you
 

00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.600
directly in dart is awesome so and you
know as Matt mentioned there's 200 plus

00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:47.610
know as Matt mentioned there's 200 plus
 

00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:49.820
know as Matt mentioned there's 200 plus
combinations and maybe some of you guys

00:21:49.820 --> 00:21:49.830
combinations and maybe some of you guys
 

00:21:49.830 --> 00:21:52.370
combinations and maybe some of you guys
have seen this it's called sauce labs I

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:52.380
have seen this it's called sauce labs I
 

00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:54.290
have seen this it's called sauce labs I
think is actually buy a bunch X Google

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:54.300
think is actually buy a bunch X Google
 

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:55.910
think is actually buy a bunch X Google
guys that ran their their internal

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:55.920
guys that ran their their internal
 

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:58.100
guys that ran their their internal
testing but it's a web service that

00:21:58.100 --> 00:21:58.110
testing but it's a web service that
 

00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:00.140
testing but it's a web service that
works with selenium that lets you test

00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:00.150
works with selenium that lets you test
 

00:22:00.150 --> 00:22:03.740
works with selenium that lets you test
like tons of different permutations so

00:22:03.740 --> 00:22:03.750
like tons of different permutations so
 

00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.450
like tons of different permutations so
once you have the selenium code working

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:05.460
once you have the selenium code working
 

00:22:05.460 --> 00:22:07.520
once you have the selenium code working
locally you just point it directly at

00:22:07.520 --> 00:22:07.530
locally you just point it directly at
 

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.650
locally you just point it directly at
the sauce lab servers and in parallel

00:22:09.650 --> 00:22:09.660
the sauce lab servers and in parallel
 

00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:11.600
the sauce lab servers and in parallel
they're gonna test against a bunch of

00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:11.610
they're gonna test against a bunch of
 

00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.210
they're gonna test against a bunch of
different browsers and so we actually

00:22:14.210 --> 00:22:14.220
different browsers and so we actually
 

00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:19.310
different browsers and so we actually
took the tests no no I have it here and

00:22:19.310 --> 00:22:19.320
took the tests no no I have it here and
 

00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:24.830
took the tests no no I have it here and
we ran it against Firefox and what's

00:22:24.830 --> 00:22:24.840
we ran it against Firefox and what's
 

00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.120
we ran it against Firefox and what's
pretty cool is when you're running it in

00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:26.130
pretty cool is when you're running it in
 

00:22:26.130 --> 00:22:28.130
pretty cool is when you're running it in
sauce labs they actually will record

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:28.140
sauce labs they actually will record
 

00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.230
sauce labs they actually will record
your in your entire set run your tests

00:22:30.230 --> 00:22:30.240
your in your entire set run your tests
 

00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.870
your in your entire set run your tests
show you the output any types of error

00:22:32.870 --> 00:22:32.880
show you the output any types of error
 

00:22:32.880 --> 00:22:37.070
show you the output any types of error
messages and it's really a boring video

00:22:37.070 --> 00:22:37.080
messages and it's really a boring video
 

00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.900
messages and it's really a boring video
it's just showing what we showed you

00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:38.910
it's just showing what we showed you
 

00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:40.940
it's just showing what we showed you
like two times already but you can see

00:22:40.940 --> 00:22:40.950
like two times already but you can see
 

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:42.830
like two times already but you can see
it's running it's running with the dart

00:22:42.830 --> 00:22:42.840
it's running it's running with the dart
 

00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:45.560
it's running it's running with the dart
library and it's running on the sauce

00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:45.570
library and it's running on the sauce

labs

00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:46.900
labs
 

00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:48.990
labs
you know engine and so this is something

00:22:48.990 --> 00:22:49.000
you know engine and so this is something
 

00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:50.610
you know engine and so this is something
that you can start using today to test

00:22:50.610 --> 00:22:50.620
that you can start using today to test
 

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:52.800
that you can start using today to test
in all these different permutations and

00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:52.810
in all these different permutations and
 

00:22:52.810 --> 00:22:56.610
in all these different permutations and
scenarios the other thing I wanted to

00:22:56.610 --> 00:22:56.620
scenarios the other thing I wanted to
 

00:22:56.620 --> 00:22:59.100
scenarios the other thing I wanted to
show just because it was so easy I

00:22:59.100 --> 00:22:59.110
show just because it was so easy I
 

00:22:59.110 --> 00:23:01.050
show just because it was so easy I
decided I wanted to test our app in

00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:01.060
decided I wanted to test our app in
 

00:23:01.060 --> 00:23:03.030
decided I wanted to test our app in
Android right why not I just had to

00:23:03.030 --> 00:23:03.040
Android right why not I just had to
 

00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:05.040
Android right why not I just had to
change like literally one one parameter

00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:05.050
change like literally one one parameter
 

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:07.020
change like literally one one parameter
and in sauce um I'm testing it in

00:23:07.020 --> 00:23:07.030
and in sauce um I'm testing it in
 

00:23:07.030 --> 00:23:10.170
and in sauce um I'm testing it in
Android and this actually ended up being

00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:10.180
Android and this actually ended up being
 

00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.790
Android and this actually ended up being
pretty fascinating and it kind of goes

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:11.800
pretty fascinating and it kind of goes
 

00:23:11.800 --> 00:23:14.370
pretty fascinating and it kind of goes
to Seth's earlier point is that we

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:14.380
to Seth's earlier point is that we
 

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.830
to Seth's earlier point is that we
should be testing everything on mobile

00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:16.840
should be testing everything on mobile
 

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:18.930
should be testing everything on mobile
and using the viewport and I think this

00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:18.940
and using the viewport and I think this
 

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.400
and using the viewport and I think this
will become very clear when I show you

00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:20.410
will become very clear when I show you
 

00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:21.840
will become very clear when I show you
what we found when we ran this on

00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:21.850
what we found when we ran this on
 

00:23:21.850 --> 00:23:23.790
what we found when we ran this on
Android so we're running on Android and

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:23.800
Android so we're running on Android and
 

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:24.660
Android so we're running on Android and
I'm not going to show the video I'll

00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:24.670
I'm not going to show the video I'll
 

00:23:24.670 --> 00:23:29.370
I'm not going to show the video I'll
just show some of the screenshots we

00:23:29.370 --> 00:23:29.380
just show some of the screenshots we
 

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:31.860
just show some of the screenshots we
instruct selenium to click on the field

00:23:31.860 --> 00:23:31.870
instruct selenium to click on the field
 

00:23:31.870 --> 00:23:33.570
instruct selenium to click on the field
and add the text and what does it

00:23:33.570 --> 00:23:33.580
and add the text and what does it
 

00:23:33.580 --> 00:23:36.060
and add the text and what does it
immediately do it zooms in all big and I

00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:36.070
immediately do it zooms in all big and I
 

00:23:36.070 --> 00:23:37.680
immediately do it zooms in all big and I
can't see any of the page now I can't

00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:37.690
can't see any of the page now I can't
 

00:23:37.690 --> 00:23:43.380
can't see any of the page now I can't
even see the button and selenium is able

00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:43.390
even see the button and selenium is able
 

00:23:43.390 --> 00:23:46.650
even see the button and selenium is able
to actually put in the the URL so that

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:46.660
to actually put in the the URL so that
 

00:23:46.660 --> 00:23:48.950
to actually put in the the URL so that
was scripted correctly but then we tell

00:23:48.950 --> 00:23:48.960
was scripted correctly but then we tell
 

00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.510
was scripted correctly but then we tell
selenium to click the button and

00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:51.520
selenium to click the button and
 

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:54.450
selenium to click the button and
selenium fails selenium says we can't

00:23:54.450 --> 00:23:54.460
selenium fails selenium says we can't
 

00:23:54.460 --> 00:23:56.940
selenium fails selenium says we can't
fix it to let me read this though this

00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:56.950
fix it to let me read this though this
 

00:23:56.950 --> 00:23:58.860
fix it to let me read this though this
web element is not visible and may not

00:23:58.860 --> 00:23:58.870
web element is not visible and may not
 

00:23:58.870 --> 00:24:00.390
web element is not visible and may not
be clicked and so that's actually kind

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:00.400
be clicked and so that's actually kind
 

00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:01.890
be clicked and so that's actually kind
of awesome because when I normally want

00:24:01.890 --> 00:24:01.900
of awesome because when I normally want
 

00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:03.180
of awesome because when I normally want
to using a tool like selenium I'm

00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:03.190
to using a tool like selenium I'm
 

00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:04.560
to using a tool like selenium I'm
thinking it's gonna find bugs like

00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:04.570
thinking it's gonna find bugs like
 

00:24:04.570 --> 00:24:06.390
thinking it's gonna find bugs like
glitches in code but this actually kind

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:06.400
glitches in code but this actually kind
 

00:24:06.400 --> 00:24:08.430
glitches in code but this actually kind
of felt like a UX error

00:24:08.430 --> 00:24:08.440
of felt like a UX error
 

00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:11.160
of felt like a UX error
so again just kind of a nice byproduct

00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:11.170
so again just kind of a nice byproduct
 

00:24:11.170 --> 00:24:13.530
so again just kind of a nice byproduct
of this is being able to test on mobile

00:24:13.530 --> 00:24:13.540
of this is being able to test on mobile
 

00:24:13.540 --> 00:24:15.510
of this is being able to test on mobile
see how your app looks so maybe you have

00:24:15.510 --> 00:24:15.520
see how your app looks so maybe you have
 

00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.130
see how your app looks so maybe you have
Android but you don't have iPhone or you

00:24:17.130 --> 00:24:17.140
Android but you don't have iPhone or you
 

00:24:17.140 --> 00:24:18.450
Android but you don't have iPhone or you
have iPhone but you don't have an iPad

00:24:18.450 --> 00:24:18.460
have iPhone but you don't have an iPad
 

00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:20.640
have iPhone but you don't have an iPad
this does all these permutations it's

00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:20.650
this does all these permutations it's
 

00:24:20.650 --> 00:24:24.480
this does all these permutations it's
free for open-source projects and there

00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:24.490
free for open-source projects and there
 

00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:26.130
free for open-source projects and there
are paid plans and it's probably cheaper

00:24:26.130 --> 00:24:26.140
are paid plans and it's probably cheaper
 

00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:27.740
are paid plans and it's probably cheaper
than hosting all the infrastructure

00:24:27.740 --> 00:24:27.750
than hosting all the infrastructure
 

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:30.330
than hosting all the infrastructure
yourself so definitely highly recommend

00:24:30.330 --> 00:24:30.340
yourself so definitely highly recommend
 

00:24:30.340 --> 00:24:32.960
yourself so definitely highly recommend
it I don't think we have a question oh

00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:32.970
it I don't think we have a question oh
 

00:24:32.970 --> 00:24:34.730
it I don't think we have a question oh
yes

00:24:34.730 --> 00:24:34.740
yes
 

00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:36.860
yes
with sauce labs I saw I was testing

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:36.870
with sauce labs I saw I was testing
 

00:24:36.870 --> 00:24:44.840
with sauce labs I saw I was testing
localhost yes so with the way scythe

00:24:44.840 --> 00:24:44.850
localhost yes so with the way scythe
 

00:24:44.850 --> 00:24:47.060
localhost yes so with the way scythe
Labs works is it actually is like a

00:24:47.060 --> 00:24:47.070
Labs works is it actually is like a
 

00:24:47.070 --> 00:24:49.220
Labs works is it actually is like a
bundled version of selenium that proxies

00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:49.230
bundled version of selenium that proxies
 

00:24:49.230 --> 00:24:51.200
bundled version of selenium that proxies
so what happens is you're actually

00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:51.210
so what happens is you're actually
 

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:53.180
so what happens is you're actually
almost exactly like what you are showing

00:24:53.180 --> 00:24:53.190
almost exactly like what you are showing
 

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.310
almost exactly like what you are showing
with the dev tools I'm running the app

00:24:55.310 --> 00:24:55.320
with the dev tools I'm running the app
 

00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:57.680
with the dev tools I'm running the app
locally and sauce labs is providing a

00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:57.690
locally and sauce labs is providing a
 

00:24:57.690 --> 00:24:59.330
locally and sauce labs is providing a
local server that's proxying all the

00:24:59.330 --> 00:24:59.340
local server that's proxying all the
 

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.549
local server that's proxying all the
traffic to their servers in their

00:25:01.549 --> 00:25:01.559
traffic to their servers in their
 

00:25:01.559 --> 00:25:03.590
traffic to their servers in their
environments so I'm very similar to what

00:25:03.590 --> 00:25:03.600
environments so I'm very similar to what
 

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:07.090
environments so I'm very similar to what
you demo was there another question

00:25:07.090 --> 00:25:07.100
you demo was there another question
 

00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:12.880
you demo was there another question
okay we're jumping back into the pitch

00:25:12.880 --> 00:25:12.890
okay we're jumping back into the pitch
 

00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:16.400
okay we're jumping back into the pitch
so the kind of last technology we wanted

00:25:16.400 --> 00:25:16.410
so the kind of last technology we wanted
 

00:25:16.410 --> 00:25:19.419
so the kind of last technology we wanted
to touch on was continuous integration

00:25:19.419 --> 00:25:19.429
to touch on was continuous integration
 

00:25:19.429 --> 00:25:22.040
to touch on was continuous integration
obviously we've built our app we're

00:25:22.040 --> 00:25:22.050
obviously we've built our app we're
 

00:25:22.050 --> 00:25:26.410
obviously we've built our app we're
running our tests be great to do that

00:25:26.410 --> 00:25:26.420
running our tests be great to do that
 

00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:28.580
running our tests be great to do that
automatically especially in a team

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:28.590
automatically especially in a team
 

00:25:28.590 --> 00:25:31.460
automatically especially in a team
setting you know if we have multiple

00:25:31.460 --> 00:25:31.470
setting you know if we have multiple
 

00:25:31.470 --> 00:25:35.870
setting you know if we have multiple
collaborators etc and so back in October

00:25:35.870 --> 00:25:35.880
collaborators etc and so back in October
 

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:40.820
collaborators etc and so back in October
of 2011 when dart launched my company

00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:40.830
of 2011 when dart launched my company
 

00:25:40.830 --> 00:25:43.310
of 2011 when dart launched my company
drone i/o started supporting dart as a

00:25:43.310 --> 00:25:43.320
drone i/o started supporting dart as a
 

00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:45.020
drone i/o started supporting dart as a
language for continuous integration and

00:25:45.020 --> 00:25:45.030
language for continuous integration and
 

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:47.240
language for continuous integration and
so a lot of the dart projects are doing

00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:47.250
so a lot of the dart projects are doing
 

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.850
so a lot of the dart projects are doing
continuous integration on drone i/o it

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:49.860
continuous integration on drone i/o it
 

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:51.710
continuous integration on drone i/o it
supports other languages as well so

00:25:51.710 --> 00:25:51.720
supports other languages as well so
 

00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:53.270
supports other languages as well so
that's what I wanted to show to you

00:25:53.270 --> 00:25:53.280
that's what I wanted to show to you
 

00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.020

pitch because I think the one thing we

00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:37.970
pitch because I think the one thing we
 

00:27:37.970 --> 00:27:40.500
pitch because I think the one thing we
want to show is how do we set up a build

00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:40.510
want to show is how do we set up a build
 

00:27:40.510 --> 00:27:42.520
want to show is how do we set up a build
is how do we instructed our build

00:27:42.520 --> 00:27:42.530
is how do we instructed our build
 

00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.800
is how do we instructed our build
commands how do we tell it to compile or

00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:44.810
commands how do we tell it to compile or
 

00:27:44.810 --> 00:27:47.020

this has some benefits in the sense that
you can build branches differently but

00:27:58.620 --> 00:27:58.630
you can build branches differently but

thing we're saying is the image we want
 

00:28:04.310 --> 00:28:06.340
thing we're saying is the image we want
to use a dart image the cool thing about

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:06.350
to use a dart image the cool thing about
 

00:28:06.350 --> 00:28:08.800
to use a dart image the cool thing about
drone is it runs all your builds inside

00:28:08.800 --> 00:28:08.810
drone is it runs all your builds inside
 

00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:10.420
drone is it runs all your builds inside
a virtual machine and it downloads those

learned today we we built an entire dart

00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:20.490
learned today we we built an entire dart
 

00:30:20.490 --> 00:30:22.609
learned today we we built an entire dart
application so client and server we saw

00:30:22.609 --> 00:30:22.619
application so client and server we saw
 

00:30:22.619 --> 00:30:24.289
application so client and server we saw
that this that you know the same codes

00:30:24.289 --> 00:30:24.299
that this that you know the same codes
 

00:30:24.299 --> 00:30:26.269
that this that you know the same codes
used on both client and server we

00:30:26.269 --> 00:30:26.279
used on both client and server we
 

00:30:26.279 --> 00:30:28.159
used on both client and server we
persisted something to a database so we

00:30:28.159 --> 00:30:28.169
persisted something to a database so we
 

00:30:28.169 --> 00:30:30.919
persisted something to a database so we
went round trip we tested things with

00:30:30.919 --> 00:30:30.929
went round trip we tested things with
 

00:30:30.929 --> 00:30:33.279
went round trip we tested things with
various testing tools we saw you know

00:30:33.279 --> 00:30:33.289
various testing tools we saw you know
 

00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:37.430
various testing tools we saw you know
whether it's through HTML or the command

00:30:37.430 --> 00:30:37.440
whether it's through HTML or the command
 

00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.320

line and we actually deployed it so we

00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:39.330
line and we actually deployed it so we
 

00:30:39.330 --> 00:30:41.299
line and we actually deployed it so we
deployed something and it was live it's

00:30:41.299 --> 00:30:41.309
deployed something and it was live it's
 

00:30:41.309 --> 00:30:44.210

out in the world there and as we were

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.220
out in the world there and as we were
 

00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:46.279
out in the world there and as we were
doing so we touched on a few of the

00:30:46.279 --> 00:30:46.289
doing so we touched on a few of the
 

00:30:46.289 --> 00:30:48.940
doing so we touched on a few of the
language features you know of dart and

00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:48.950
language features you know of dart and
 

00:30:48.950 --> 00:30:51.049
language features you know of dart and
you know cement some additional tools

00:30:51.049 --> 00:30:51.059
you know cement some additional tools
 

00:30:51.059 --> 00:30:52.310

again wrapping up with that continuous
integration and really showing how you

00:30:57.109 --> 00:30:57.119
integration and really showing how you
 

00:30:57.119 --> 00:30:58.700
integration and really showing how you
know that could really ease your

00:30:58.700 --> 00:30:58.710

Seth reinforce that fact yeah no we
don't have memory leaks so I was easy to

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:32.630
don't have memory leaks so I was easy to

answer no I won one distinction of
course I don't know what libraries using

00:33:38.260 --> 00:33:38.270
course I don't know what libraries using
 

00:33:38.270 --> 00:33:40.750
course I don't know what libraries using
etc but one thing that we take very

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:40.760
etc but one thing that we take very
 

00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:42.580
etc but one thing that we take very
seriously on the dart project is tool

00:33:42.580 --> 00:33:42.590
seriously on the dart project is tool
 

00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.940
seriously on the dart project is tool
ability and so we've been working on

00:33:45.940 --> 00:33:45.950
ability and so we've been working on
 

00:33:45.950 --> 00:33:48.850
ability and so we've been working on
this project called Observatory which is

00:33:48.850 --> 00:33:48.860
this project called Observatory which is
 

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:50.800
this project called Observatory which is
actually a polymer app you connect

00:33:50.800 --> 00:33:50.810
actually a polymer app you connect
 

00:33:50.810 --> 00:33:52.930
actually a polymer app you connect
directly to the virtual machine and you

00:33:52.930 --> 00:33:52.940
directly to the virtual machine and you
 

00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:55.390
directly to the virtual machine and you
get to inspect it in real time and we're

00:33:55.390 --> 00:33:55.400
get to inspect it in real time and we're
 

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:56.740
get to inspect it in real time and we're
adding more and more things to it things

00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:56.750
adding more and more things to it things

what's a heat profile going on right now
 

00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:03.640
what's a heat profile going on right now
what's a CPU profile going on right now

00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:03.650
what's a CPU profile going on right now
 

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.950
what's a CPU profile going on right now
so you know I don't I don't know and

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:05.960
so you know I don't I don't know and
 

00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:08.830
so you know I don't I don't know and
every time people have bugs but we hope

00:34:08.830 --> 00:34:08.840
every time people have bugs but we hope
 

00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:10.630
every time people have bugs but we hope
to give you the tools that go in and
