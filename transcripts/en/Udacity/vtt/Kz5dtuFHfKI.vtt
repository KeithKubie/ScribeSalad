00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:04.130
It turns out that any monomial that we encounter will be an example of a

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:08.207
polynomial. Monomials have one term, and are the products of constant

00:00:08.207 --> 00:00:12.796
coefficients and variables. Binomials are another type of polynomial. These

00:00:12.796 --> 00:00:17.597
contain exactly two terms. A trinomial is another example of a polynomial. This

00:00:17.597 --> 00:00:22.398
one has three terms. I've been throwing this word term around a lot. And a term

00:00:22.398 --> 00:00:26.879
is simply the product of numbers and variables. This is one term. This is one

00:00:26.879 --> 00:00:31.453
term. And this is one term. The same is true for these. When we have addition or

00:00:31.453 --> 00:00:36.033
subtraction between two terms, that's when we call it a binomial. And the same

00:00:36.033 --> 00:00:40.656
is true in this case. We call this a trinomial. You can remember these terms

00:00:40.656 --> 00:00:45.355
based on their prefix. Mono means one. Bi means two. And tri means three. That

00:00:45.355 --> 00:00:50.201
should be pretty familiar. A bicycle has two wheels. A triangle has three sides.

00:00:50.201 --> 00:00:54.439
Maybe you can think of some other words that start with these prefixes.
