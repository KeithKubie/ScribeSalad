In today's video,
we are revisiting our hydrophobic sand,

00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:03.320
In today's video,
we are revisiting our hydrophobic sand,

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:05.340
trying to make it even more
waterproof than before,

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:08.020
and using a variety
of bright vibrant colors.

00:00:08.020 --> 00:00:16.920
[Music]

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:19.380
A while back, we did a few
experiments trying to find a good way

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.860
to make magic sand or hydrophobic sand.

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.600
That's a sand that
you can pour into water,

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:27.580
but it repels the water, holding in
a sort of shield of air around itself,

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.560
so that when you pull the sand
back up out, it's dry sand,

00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:32.540
and pours all over the
same way dry sand would,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:34.980
rather than clumping together
the way wet sand does.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.140
We tested a silicone
waterproofing spray,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.120
Scotch Guard and NeverWet,

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:42.480
a two-part product that's really
just designed to repel water a lot.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.320
We got some pretty good
results with all of them,

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.620
with the most water repelling
results from the NeverWet.

00:00:47.620 --> 00:00:50.520
However, I've done a little bit
more experimentation since there

00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:53.580
and there are a couple issues that
I keep running into with the NeverWet.

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.560
First off, it's a two-part spray,

00:00:55.560 --> 00:00:58.480
and the first one really makes
the sand clumped together.

00:00:58.480 --> 00:01:00.840
It hardens into almost this solid shell,

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:02.300
and so after it dries,

00:01:02.300 --> 00:01:05.380
you have to break it back up
into the individual grains of sand.

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:08.500
It's hard to get a really
fine grain after you've done all that.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.680
Secondly, NeverWet seems to be
increasingly hard to find in stores.

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.640
There are three places I used
to know you can get it

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.100
that don't seem to carry it anymore.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.900
So I decided to go back and try
and see if we can get better

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.580
results with the other products.

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:22.920
So the goal today is
to make hydrophobic sand

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.660
that repels water just as well
as the NeverWet did

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:28.640
by using our silicone spray
rather than the NeverWet.

00:01:28.640 --> 00:01:32.100
I also went out and I found some
colored jars of sand at a craft store,

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.320
and they do come all the way full,
not half empty like they are here.

00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:37.090
But I had to do some experimentation,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.300
so that's why we're missing
some of the sand in these jars.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:41.480
To get started, all you really
need is some colored sand,

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:45.280
your waterproofing silicone spray,
a little cup and some aluminum foil.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.280
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:48.219
Using colored sand from craft Store,

00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.640
we're going to soak it
in waterproofing silicone,

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.680
let it dry,

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:54.320
and then add a second and
third layer of waterproofing

00:01:54.320 --> 00:01:56.620
just to make sure
it's extremely hydrophobic.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.320
To start, let's take some of our sand
and pour it into our small cup.

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:02.120
If you want to try and
make a lot of it once,

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:03.540
you can use the whole jar.

00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.620
If you only want a little bit,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:06.920
then just measure out
what you want to start with.

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.800
In my last trial, I tried spraying
on three layers of the silicone spray,

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:13.200
and it did work fairly well.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.420
We had some good
repelling of the water.

00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:17.360
We were able to get the sand
go down into the water,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.940
and come back up mostly dry.

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:21.140
But it wasn't quite
as good as I want,

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:24.960
and I now believe that the reason for
that is it wasn't completely coated.

00:02:25.160 --> 00:02:29.140
So when experimenting, I just found a
better way to coat the sand completely.

00:02:29.140 --> 00:02:32.860
So it makes sure that every
single grain is really slathered

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.020
and surrounded by the silicone spray.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:38.160
That's why we have it in a cup rather
than spread out on a cookie sheet,

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.120
the way we did before.

00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.480
With our sand in the cup,

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.880
the goal is to now spray in
so much of this silicone

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.820
that it actually gets our sand
kind of soaking wet in the spray.

00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:49.900
I'm going to do that outside
because I definitely don't want

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:51.380
to be breathing that in in here.

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:55.040
Let's also take a small piece
of aluminum foil about this size.

00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.460
It's not very important and what
we're actually going to use this for,

00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.620
we'll bend it a little bit in the middle and
we'll spray our silicone right onto the foil,

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:04.340
and let it drip and run down into the sand.

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:19.660
[Music]

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.840
At this point, our container is
soaked with the silicone spray.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.760
You can look at the bottom
of the container and see that

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.400
even the sand all the way down there
is completely covered in our silicone.

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:32.540
[Music]

00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:35.500
Now, that our sand is
completely soaked in our silicone,

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:39.520
what we want to do is let it dry,
laying out flat on a piece of foil.

00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:40.400
Here's a sheet of foil.

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:43.620
I like to turn the edges up
so that when our sand is dry,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.540
it's not so likely to just
slide or blow off the edge.

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:50.640
Now let's take our sand,
put it onto the foil and spread it out

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:52.060
about as thin as we can get it.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:04:03.520
[Music]

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:07.620
With the sand spread out,
now comes the slightly less exciting part.

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:11.320
You have to let it dry out and
I mean completely dry out.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:14.500
The silicone will get to a point
where it no longer is causing the sand

00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.440
to stick together.

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:18.160
And when that happens, it will act
like normal sand when you pick it up.

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:20.400
it'll just drop down
and be individual grains,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.880
not sticking together at all.

00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:24.600
If you leave it outside,
it can take 24 to 48 hours.

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:27.300
If it's sunny and warm,
it will definitely go faster.

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:29.400
As another option
for speeding things up,

00:04:29.410 --> 00:04:32.640
If you happen to have built
one of our Dehydrotron 5000

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.780
food dehydrators,

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:36.720
you can also use this to
help dry out your sand faster.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:39.120
I wouldn't recommend
using it at full heat,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.940
but on medium heat with the fan going,

00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:44.580
it will dry out much faster in this box
than even sitting outside in the sun.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.780
When I made the Dehydrotron 5000,

00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:50.060
there were a few people who
pointed out that I was risking my safety

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:53.440
by wiring the dimmer switch
to the white wire in the cord,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.740
rather than the black one.

00:04:54.740 --> 00:04:55.580
You are correct.

00:04:55.580 --> 00:04:58.860
It should be wired to the black
went and I have since rewired it,

00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:00.280
switching those together.

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.320
Soldering them together
and using heat shrink

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:03.620
rather than electrical tape.

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:06.220
Whichever method you use,
sunshine or dehydrator,

00:05:06.220 --> 00:05:07.200
to dry out your sand,

00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:09.560
once it's back to a dry crumbly state,

00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:13.900
it's time to apply two more layers
of the Silicon using the same methods.

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:16.840
Once again get our sand
completely soaked in the silicone,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:18.240
mix it up really well,

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.920
flatten it out and let it dry.

00:05:20.780 --> 00:05:23.280
After the third time soaking
the sand and letting it dry out,

00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.350
whether in the Sun or the dehydrator

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.680
your sand should now be ready
for testing and playing in the water.

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.620
I've gone ahead and made
batches of our hydrophobic sand

00:05:31.620 --> 00:05:34.680
in five different colors and I'm excited
to see how it looks under water.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:44.700
[Music]

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.180
Before we start using any of these 
hydrophobic sands under water,

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:49.550
I do want to take just
a quick look at the difference

00:05:49.550 --> 00:05:51.880
between the hydrophobic
sand that we've created,

00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:54.540
and the original untreated
sand that it starts as.

00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:56.000
Here's our untreated sand,

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.860
and here is the hydrophobic
sand that we've made.

00:05:58.860 --> 00:06:01.840
Now both of these
are dry and pretty powdery.

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:05.200
You can see that there are
little bits of differences.

00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:08.280
I would say that the color on
our treated hydrophobic sand

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:11.400
looks a tiny bit more vibrant
than our untreated sand.

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:14.960
It's not a big difference
but it's a slight change in color.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.140
Another difference is that the
hydrophobic sand actually just feels

00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:20.640
somewhat softer,

00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:24.720
which means that gathering up all of
the tens of thousands of individual grains

00:06:24.720 --> 00:06:26.220
covered in the silicone,

00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.580
something is actually changing to make
it feel just a little bit spongier almost.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.320
I know some people think that sand
is coarse and rough and irritating,

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.310
and it gets everywhere but the
hydrophobic sand is a little less

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:39.900
course and rough and irritating.

00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:48.340
[Music]

00:06:48.780 --> 00:06:49.960
All right, here as the first test,

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.460
I have a spoonful of
our red hydrophobic sand,

00:06:52.460 --> 00:06:54.280
I'm just going to dip that
down under the water,

00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:55.240
not even pour it,

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.980
which is dip it down
and then pull it back up.

00:06:57.980 --> 00:06:59.760
[Music]

00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:02.020
Look at that.
Still just powder on top.

00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:04.200
Let's pour some of those down
into the water and see what happens.

00:07:04.200 --> 00:08:18.610
[Music]

00:08:18.610 --> 00:08:20.600
Guys, this stuff is a ton of fun.

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.460
It really does a pretty good
job of being hydrophobic.

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:26.500
This sand has now been down in here
for like 15-20 minutes kind of thing,

00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:30.380
and when I pull it out,
it's still like dry powdery sand on top.

00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:33.360
Now eventually, this can get
water absorbed into it,

00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.740
and if that happens,
all you need to do is spread it out,

00:08:35.740 --> 00:08:36.680
let it dry again,

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:38.620
and it's back to being good as new.

00:08:38.640 --> 00:08:42.070
Although in our case, we've now got,
instead of five different colors of sand,

00:08:42.070 --> 00:08:44.620
we've got five colors
of sand all mixed together,

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.210
and you know if you
like that look, great!

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:51.160
Otherwise, you want to keep your
different colors separated in the water

00:08:51.160 --> 00:08:52.640
if you ever want them to stay separated.

00:08:52.640 --> 00:08:55.320
Once they're mixed,
there's no unmixing them.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.040
Although I think I saw an episode of that
old Batman, the Adam West Batman,

00:08:59.040 --> 00:09:02.440
he had a machine designed to
separate out different colors of powders.

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:05.140
If we can get one of those,
then this will be all settled.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.260
Colored sand and some
silicone waterproofing spray,

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:12.500
which is sold with shoes
in most department stores.

00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:15.540
It's just designed for spraying on
and then you make your shoes waterproof.

00:09:15.550 --> 00:09:18.320
But in this case we're doing
the same thing with sand,

00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:19.600
and it's pretty fun to play with.

00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:22.860
You can make some cool
like underwater sand castles and stuff,

00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:26.520
and it just forms these
weird little structures,

00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:29.440
and then stays dry when you pull
it out and it's just a powder again.

00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:30.540
So much fun.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.160
It is coarse and rough and irritating.

00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:35.140
Like drawing my arm off.

00:09:35.140 --> 00:09:38.300
It's just like under the paper towel
so it's like hitting my arm with sandpaper,

00:09:38.620 --> 00:09:39.920
Anakin was right!

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:42.680
Guys, that's not all,
we've got more for you see.

00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:45.750
That box up at the top will transport
you directly to our last video.

00:09:45.750 --> 00:09:47.680
And of course, you should
go check that out.

00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.580
The box of the bottom will
show you what YouTube thinks

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:50.700
