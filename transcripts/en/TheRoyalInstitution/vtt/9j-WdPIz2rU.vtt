00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.989
That looks like
a head for a giraffe.

00:00:01.989 --> 00:00:04.379
Looks like a rainbow wand.

00:00:04.379 --> 00:00:08.550
Looks like a king caterpillar
and the same on there.

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:11.581
Our brains are constantly trying to
make sense of the world around us.

00:00:11.581 --> 00:00:15.230
In this activity, you and your
kids will look for familiar shapes

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.360
in random patterns and learn about

00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:22.000
how our brains process
the things we see.

00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:41.240
Have you never been in the park
when you've looked up to the sky

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.920
and you've looked at the clouds
and you've seen funny shapes.

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:48.501
Can you imagine what kind
of shapes you will have seen in the clouds?

00:00:48.501 --> 00:00:49.501
A duck.
- Yup.

00:00:49.501 --> 00:00:53.170
I've definitely seen a duck
at some point. What other shapes?

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:56.520
Mouse.
- Possibly. Or an elephant?

00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.660
You’ve probably
looked up at the sky

00:00:58.660 --> 00:01:01.770
and spotted shapes
in the clouds before.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:05.000
Even though we know there
really isn’t a duck or a mouse,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.780
our brains are always
scanning for shapes and objects

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:10.410
that we recognise from everyday life.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:16.720
Talking about this familiar idea is
a really good way to get the activity going.

00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.490
Phoebe, look at all these paints.

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:30.440
I want you to choose one or two colours
and then we'll splat them on a paper.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:33.990
Fold the paper over and then see
if we can see any shapes. OK?

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:36.340
So try putting some on.

00:01:36.340 --> 00:01:46.520
And then we turn it over.

00:01:46.520 --> 00:01:50.480
Oh wow.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.851
What do you think?
Can you see anything there?

00:01:53.851 --> 00:01:57.320
Ooh yeah! That one
looks like a bit like a fish

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.240
and that one looks like a foot.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:04.200
Like a foot.
- With two little toes.

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:07.420
These patterns might remind you
of the classic ‘inkblot test’

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:10.829
that was once used to try and tell
things about people’s personalities

00:02:10.829 --> 00:02:13.159
according to what shapes they saw.

00:02:13.159 --> 00:02:16.319
Psychologists have
long-since stopped using this,

00:02:16.319 --> 00:02:21.540
so this experiment is not about trying
to infer anything about your child’s psyche.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:24.709
Instead it’s about raising
interesting ideas about

00:02:24.709 --> 00:02:28.650
why we find it so easy
to see shapes in random patterns,

00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:31.800
experimenting, and having fun.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.680
Ooh.
- Ooh.

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.919
Next time I think we should
put the blobs there

00:02:41.919 --> 00:02:44.859
and then fold it
over without mixing it up

00:02:44.859 --> 00:02:46.709
and see what shapes we get.

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.269
OK, let's do it.

00:02:48.269 --> 00:02:52.499
Encourage your children to think
of different ways to change the paintings.

00:02:52.499 --> 00:02:55.780
They could add more colours,
fold the paper in a different way,

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.349
or mix the colours together.

00:02:57.349 --> 00:03:01.409
And see what colour it makes
and also see what shape it makes.

00:03:01.409 --> 00:03:05.269
By doing this, they’re getting used to
changing different factors in an experiment,

00:03:05.269 --> 00:03:10.469
and it might get them thinking about
how they recognise objects in real life.

00:03:10.469 --> 00:03:16.749
That way looking it looked
like a potato with two ears.

00:03:16.749 --> 00:03:18.870
A potato with two ears!

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:22.480
We see shapes and objects in the
random patterns because our brains

00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:26.870
are so well designed to spot and
remember objects and animals in real life.

00:03:26.870 --> 00:03:32.040
It’s sort of a short-cut our brains
use to process the world quickly,

00:03:32.040 --> 00:03:38.870
but it can sometimes mean
we see things in unexpected places.

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.859
Did you find it easier to see
more shapes with all the colours

00:03:45.859 --> 00:03:49.129
or easier with just the one colour?

00:03:49.129 --> 00:03:51.049
Easier with loads of colours.

00:03:51.049 --> 00:03:54.879
Do you?
And why is that?

00:03:54.879 --> 00:03:57.299
Because I think it would
make a different shape.

00:03:57.299 --> 00:04:01.199
Encourage your children to think
about which shapes are easiest to see,

00:04:01.199 --> 00:04:05.139
what affects how easy it is,
and why this might be.

00:04:05.139 --> 00:04:08.969
Questions like these will get them
thinking more deeply about the activity,

00:04:08.969 --> 00:04:12.849
and may help them appreciate how our
brains make sense of the things we see.

00:04:12.849 --> 00:04:15.709
So do you think you're
seeing a butterfly in that shape

00:04:15.709 --> 00:04:19.500
because you know what a butterfly looks
like and that you like butterflies

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.950
and you think about butterflies?
- Yeah.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:27.060
Which ones do you think
have created the best shapes?

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:31.990
That one and the flower.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.650
You see a flower.
- Yeah.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:38.940
But when I look at it, I see
a person jumping up, didn't I?

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:42.360
So why do you think I can see a
person jumping up but you can see a flower?

00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:43.360
Because it's just like...

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:46.350
When the paintings are all dry,
try adding detail with a pen

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.340
to make the shapes
look even more life-like.

00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:52.890
And next time you’re in the park,
look up at the clouds

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.970
and see what shapes you can spot.

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.320
We've had a great time this afternoon
with all the paint and mess.

00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:00.280
If you'd like to try it for yourself,

00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.930
then you can go the Ri website
for more information

00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:04.720
