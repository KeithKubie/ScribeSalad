00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.120
 in this capture we will see in addition to 

00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.649
 details the concept of image contaut 

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:11.580
 so as we saw near 1 

00:00:07.649 --> 00:00:13.559
 previously an account also makes it a 

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:15.000
 sudden change in intensity or 

00:00:13.559 --> 00:00:18.029
 the color of adjacent pixels 

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.039
 locally in an image so that's it 

00:00:18.029 --> 00:00:21.240
 corresponds to pixels that was found 

00:00:20.039 --> 00:00:23.640
 in image rights where there are a lot of 

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:26.430
 variations in intensity or 

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:29.550
 color of the pixels there by 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:31.800
 example all these pixels here here they are 

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:35.910
 a place where there is enough variation 

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:38.879
 high intensity between the color of 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:41.640
 that wall here and then there the intensity of 

00:00:38.879 --> 00:00:43.350
 pixels for this table here so we got it 

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.730
 we will not tell you that moment 

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:46.710
 in a horrible act that would make the 

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:50.190
 account detection in the tale so 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:52.890
 would identify the pixels that are on a 

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:55.789
 account or like that between the wall and the 

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:59.640
 same thing if you have a shape with 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:01:01.980
 different faces like that here so we 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.140
 might rather want to have all 

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.060
 the pixels and all the time quoted 

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:07.350
 associated with this form simply 

00:01:06.060 --> 00:01:09.840
 ability to identify 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:11.189
 where are the imitation the different 

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:13.770
 faces or between different colors 

00:01:11.189 --> 00:01:15.750
 on the form in question so already 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:18.390
 Moreover, in this case we can quite 

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:21.720
 much better identify than this image there 

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.009
 here is a stapler so already 

00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:25.770
 just in the outlines there are a lot 

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:29.340
 useful information about compared to 

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:31.140
 the image that so the information that is 

00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:32.579
 reduced by not the original image but 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:33.840
 which could allow us to solve 

00:01:32.579 --> 00:01:37.790
 some vision tasks by 

00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.790
 computer without difficulty 

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.350
 what can cause outlines 

00:01:41.299 --> 00:01:44.960
 in an image 

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:46.460
 we distinguish four factors the first 

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.450
 it is when a change of depth 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:50.600
 in the picture 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:52.940
 so if we look here we have an account 

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:55.790
 or because that object is there 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.420
 closer to us in the scene 

00:01:55.790 --> 00:02:00.820
 visual that the background here that can 

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.030
 to be a change of orientation 

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:06.950
 of a surface then this tale shot here 

00:02:04.030 --> 00:02:09.530
 it exists because we have two facets 

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:13.510
 face here this phase if they have any 

00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:15.860
 different orientations in space 

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:19.310
 it can also be a change of 

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.590
 color so related to reflection 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:23.870
 finally a surface then we have some 

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:26.300
 outlines here for example and all along 

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:28.370
 of character because the character a 

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:31.790
 different color of the surface on the 

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:33.680
 cube here and it can be also 

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:35.810
 illumination changes so a 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:40.840
 shadow for example such as we have 

00:02:35.810 --> 00:02:43.790
 here will define an outline in the image 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:46.070
 it's the four changes the four 

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:50.720
 information that we will keep in 

00:02:46.070 --> 00:02:53.209
 doing extraction account we do not live 

00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.780
 in a previous example that with the 

00:02:53.209 --> 00:02:57.620
 calculating gradients from an image to 

00:02:56.780 --> 00:02:59.630
 each position 

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:03.049
 we could do an account detection 

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:05.299
 another simple by actually taking what 

00:03:03.049 --> 00:03:07.549
 corresponds is the name ucl and 

00:03:05.299 --> 00:03:09.850
 become gradients so 

00:03:07.549 --> 00:03:12.650
 actually if these first elements 

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:13.209
 of the keeper on the 12th or the inverted little 

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:15.799
 imported 

00:03:13.209 --> 00:03:17.120
 Well, the norm would be to take the bus 

00:03:15.799 --> 00:03:20.690
 and of the two elements then finally 

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:22.970
 do the square root for that would be 

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:24.950
 so the standard ucs lydian gradients 

00:03:22.970 --> 00:03:26.510
 and from this information there we 

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:30.650
 can do contour detections in 

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:33.440
 applying to the ground is what we did 

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:35.239
 here and we had managed quite 

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:39.140
 well identified the pixels are on the 

00:03:35.239 --> 00:03:40.970
 contours between the landreau there are two 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.450
 languages ​​is associated with our character 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:46.209
 and the background so the outline allowed 

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:49.590
 to finally identify changes 

00:03:46.209 --> 00:03:55.109
 intensity colors 

00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:55.109
 of reflection finally in my image 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:02.230
 and in more complex images or 

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:04.409
 more natural often the estimate of 

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:07.389
 variations will be made gross and 

00:04:04.409 --> 00:04:09.400
 actually we saw that the gradient 

00:04:07.389 --> 00:04:12.099
 of an aunt's image of ultimately estimated 

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.239
 the gradient of an image function that 

00:04:12.099 --> 00:04:14.829
 would give the value of the pixels to 

00:04:13.239 --> 00:04:17.440
 any position in an image 

00:04:14.829 --> 00:04:21.519
 and we approximate that by taking a 

00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.259
 delta which was equal to a final so to 

00:04:21.519 --> 00:04:25.330
 because of his orders a certain noise 

00:04:23.259 --> 00:04:26.949
 in the estimation of contours then that 

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:29.110
 may also be due to the fact that some 

00:04:26.949 --> 00:04:32.130
 just noises in the way that the picture has 

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:36.820
 been gained so let's take an example where 

00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:39.250
 we want to have the estimates of 

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:41.289
 gradient right on that line there in 

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.620
 this image that drew every year on 

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:45.190
 an orbit 

00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.169
 we have here 

00:04:45.190 --> 00:04:49.300
 the intensity of the pixels on this line 

00:04:47.169 --> 00:04:53.410
 there we will paste a density base 

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:55.180
 followed by a high intensity and at this 

00:04:53.410 --> 00:04:57.070
 moment are made the estimate of the 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:59.110
 vertical variation with a simple 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:02.320
 difference in pixels for example this 

00:04:59.110 --> 00:05:05.970
 what we see is that we have a place where 

00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:09.070
 a high variation that corresponds to do 

00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:13.180
 open right where there is a check by 

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:15.550
 against we had our high value of the 

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.690
 variation that is a bit lower than 

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.900
 the one for the real control but who 

00:05:16.690 --> 00:05:22.599
 still high and just from 6 

00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:24.340
 years is applied it may be 

00:05:22.599 --> 00:05:25.449
 not easy to choose a threshold such as 

00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.639
 in this case we're fine 

00:05:25.449 --> 00:05:29.080
 parisseaux of that to face we observe everything 

00:05:27.639 --> 00:05:31.509
 it's not really clear why 

00:05:29.080 --> 00:05:33.880
 would that correspond to open 

00:05:31.509 --> 00:05:36.070
 contours and this point here in fact this 

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:39.419
 would rather be a fake accounts to people 

00:05:36.070 --> 00:05:39.419
 how can we fix this problem 

00:05:39.509 --> 00:05:45.789
 one way of doing it is actually to 

00:05:42.759 --> 00:05:47.979
 smooth the result of the estimation of 

00:05:45.789 --> 00:05:49.750
 variations as we make the 

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:51.580
 best vertical versions what we 

00:05:49.750 --> 00:05:53.590
 is that we apply when we 

00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:56.320
 apply a correlation on this filter 

00:05:53.590 --> 00:05:57.969
 water here is what we could do 

00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:00.669
 it's once we'd applied 

00:05:57.969 --> 00:06:02.500
 this correlation there we prepare the continuation 

00:06:00.669 --> 00:06:02.889
 apply a filter that will smooth the 

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:04.900
 network 

00:06:02.889 --> 00:06:06.639
 and a filter that is often used 

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:08.919
 to do that it's the one called 

00:06:06.639 --> 00:06:11.740
 the Gaussian filter so see there a 

00:06:08.919 --> 00:06:13.449
 high value in the center then we will see a 

00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:15.569
 little weaker right next 

00:06:13.449 --> 00:06:17.529
 and even more to do a little further 

00:06:15.569 --> 00:06:20.229
 but in this case we chose a 

00:06:17.529 --> 00:06:22.449
 filter with a length of 5 

00:06:20.229 --> 00:06:28.779
 we could have chosen a filter more 

00:06:22.449 --> 00:06:31.509
 serious so also I will add that 

00:06:28.779 --> 00:06:32.800
 when we do the calculation of this smoothing 

00:06:31.509 --> 00:06:36.569
 the beyond in this case we will use 

00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:36.569
 what was called paperless 

00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:43.120
 gold the little gauthier the way we go 

00:06:41.590 --> 00:06:46.240
 the calculation is actually like that it's a 

00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:49.539
 example of file gossip it corresponds to 

00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:53.860
 take for value in the center of 

00:06:49.539 --> 00:06:55.029
 filters the exponential 2-0 in fact and 

00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:57.759
 for others then we will take 

00:06:55.029 --> 00:07:00.279
 the exponential puts distance to 

00:06:57.759 --> 00:07:01.990
 made between this position too and the 

00:07:00.279 --> 00:07:03.759
 meaning so for example if we are at 

00:07:01.990 --> 00:07:05.529
 to be a distance of 1 from the center here a 

00:07:03.759 --> 00:07:08.099
 distance of 200 we will take 

00:07:05.529 --> 00:07:10.719
 the experience y l2 - the distance squared 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:15.240
 and we will do that for all 

00:07:10.719 --> 00:07:18.310
 positions in the filter and finally 

00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:20.529
 we will divide by a constant that 

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:21.819
 that we find everywhere here it is in 

00:07:20.529 --> 00:07:23.589
 does a kind of constants of 

00:07:21.819 --> 00:07:26.860
 standardization so we have to take all 

00:07:23.589 --> 00:07:29.680
 the land numbers we have here equals 

00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.659
 add them up so that the filters him 

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:33.759
 his sleep all the entries in 

00:07:31.659 --> 00:07:37.139
 our filter at all places on 

00:07:33.759 --> 00:07:37.139
 would have a sum that will be equal to 1 

00:07:38.189 --> 00:07:44.919
 we can drink z as a species of 

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:46.960
 standardization constants we have here in 

00:07:44.919 --> 00:07:49.810
 does the general formula I was saying 

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:51.699
 that this is an example of filters so 

00:07:49.810 --> 00:07:53.500
 when you have to define the Gaussian movie 

00:07:51.699 --> 00:07:57.789
 we start by choosing what time it is going 

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.839
 have I decided to extend 5 

00:07:57.789 --> 00:08:01.509
 we could also define 

00:07:58.839 --> 00:08:02.860
 two-dimensional throat filters 

00:08:01.509 --> 00:08:05.770
 when this because I was doing a 

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:07.419
 estimate only on an axis on 

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:10.689
 the vertical axis I had infiltrating a 

00:08:07.419 --> 00:08:12.430
 only dimension and so we start a 

00:08:10.689 --> 00:08:14.709
 chose the size of the film chooses 

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:15.550
 also sigma settings that will 

00:08:14.709 --> 00:08:17.470
 determine 

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:19.570
 as for the smoothing parameters me 

00:08:17.470 --> 00:08:22.120
 determine how well we fit 

00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.900
 smooth so let's start plus the value of 

00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:25.420
 six months of strike 

00:08:22.900 --> 00:08:27.160
 the more we go to high school, that is to say that the 

00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:29.650
 calculated value a place in my 

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:32.830
 estimate your corresponding sons to the 

00:08:29.650 --> 00:08:34.930
 combination of several values ​​everywhere 

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:37.270
 in the filter so actually if I 

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:39.550
 take if I do there against correlation 

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:41.920
 to end up here at a given value 

00:08:39.550 --> 00:08:46.030
 I will actually have after the 

00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:48.100
 correlation 0.56 times the value a 

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:52.080
 given position in my picture or in 

00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:54.940
 my estimate of variations more 

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:58.240
 0.21 times the value that just next I 

00:08:54.940 --> 00:09:01.840
 meaning here the 0.21 times the value that 

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:05.200
 just down then plus 0.02 position 

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:06.670
 roux 0.02 possible so we see that after 

00:09:05.200 --> 00:09:09.130
 to have made this correlation there in fact 

00:09:06.670 --> 00:09:11.350
 we will have finally replaced the 

00:09:09.130 --> 00:09:15.010
 value a place given by a species 

00:09:11.350 --> 00:09:18.310
 weighted average of the values ​​around 

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:19.930
 of 1 pixel gives so that's why 

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.310
 we're going to say we're going to him it's actually 

00:09:19.930 --> 00:09:22.600
 because when we see the result 

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:24.550
 we will get a curve that will be 

00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:26.740
 much smoother and this cinema there 

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:29.290
 that's what will ultimately control at 

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:32.710
 how much higher is it the higher the 

00:09:29.290 --> 00:09:34.840
 value here your little one and worth to be 

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:39.040
 finally close to the values ​​we see 

00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:42.250
 here here so less than the value in the 

00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:46.690
 filter vary according to the distance 

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:47.770
 between a position and the meaning and the 

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.810
 reason why it's called the 

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:52.240
 goscinny filter what this formula is 

00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:54.250
 here recent morphine distribution 

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:56.830
 Gaussian statistics 

00:09:54.250 --> 00:10:00.010
 actually we have the experience of -1 

00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:02.800
 terms of distance squared / term 

00:10:00.010 --> 00:10:07.470
 variation of variant measures 

00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:11.740
 return to our example 

00:10:07.470 --> 00:10:15.210
 when six we apply a smoothing with 

00:10:11.740 --> 00:10:19.480
 a Gaussian filter to our estimate 

00:10:15.210 --> 00:10:22.150
 vertical variations here what we 

00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:23.680
 gets because also for a certain 

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:24.210
 movie is a curve much more 

00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:27.100
 smooth 

00:10:24.210 --> 00:10:28.620
 because for example the value here in 

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:30.150
 do it now 

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:34.440
 a kind of fighting means when 

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:36.150
 sorry the value here earlier this is a 

00:10:34.440 --> 00:10:37.170
 way of weighting the value that there 

00:10:36.150 --> 00:10:40.080
 had here 

00:10:37.170 --> 00:10:43.140
 but here also here also if 

00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:45.750
 also so instituted and because 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:48.000
 that for this place if in fact I had 

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:51.780
 a fairly high value but close to 

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.000
 very low values ​​the the species of 

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:56.400
 summit here was flattened in the 

00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:58.020
 variant here and we now have a 

00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:00.920
 higher value only at the place 

00:10:58.020 --> 00:11:02.870
 where we actually had an account at 

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:05.060
 pedestrians through smoothing 

00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:09.060
 the identification of accounts to become 

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:12.060
 more robust to noises that could 

00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:17.330
 exist in our previous calculation of 

00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:19.980
 vertical variations so that's a 

00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:23.370
 presentation of a very simple version 

00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.530
 detection contaut for example we do 

00:11:23.370 --> 00:11:28.110
 of estimating gradients to make 

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:30.660
 of estimation of control of the calculation of 

00:11:28.110 --> 00:11:32.280
 image turf generally the crooked 

00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:34.590
 which corresponds to taking the difference 

00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:37.380
 between just a pair of pixels 

00:11:34.590 --> 00:11:39.990
 neighbor little to be improved exist 

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:41.760
 filters so they'll be a little 

00:11:39.990 --> 00:11:43.530
 more robust in the calculation of 

00:11:41.760 --> 00:11:45.570
 gradients is among other things the filters 

00:11:43.530 --> 00:11:48.600
 of his beautiful who can be viewed 

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:50.520
 here the contour detection also 

00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:52.620
 rather than doing it with a simple 

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:55.350
 he has not been improved 

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:58.470
 among others the Cagnes filter and where 

00:11:55.350 --> 00:12:00.750
 the kenya of the detector that makes a 

00:11:58.470 --> 00:12:03.750
 estimation of the contours detection of 

00:12:00.750 --> 00:12:05.700
 contour improved once one has a 

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:07.230
 detection of contours son it's 

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:08.820
 possible to extract information 

00:12:07.230 --> 00:12:11.100
 even higher level for example a 

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:12.930
 detector of straight lines or 

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.580
 circles in the pictures rather than 

00:12:12.930 --> 00:12:16.200
 to have only one image where at 

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:18.360
 each fiction also is from a 

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:20.550
 account or not one could extract from his 

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:23.340
 the parametric forms finally 

00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:25.560
 straight death is well located this 

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:28.260
 in an image and it happened with this 

00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:30.270
 what is called the transformation of who 

00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:32.630
 can also be consulted in 

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:32.630
 Literature
