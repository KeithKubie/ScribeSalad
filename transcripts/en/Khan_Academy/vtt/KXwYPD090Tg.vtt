00:00:00.119 --> 00:00:02.035
- [Voiceover] Now that
we've read the passage,

00:00:02.035 --> 00:00:04.461
let's see if we can answer
some questions around it.

00:00:04.461 --> 00:00:06.128
So, question number one:

00:00:14.536 --> 00:00:15.145
So, we remember that,

00:00:15.145 --> 00:00:16.315
if I remember correctly,

00:00:16.315 --> 00:00:18.122
the passage started with Adelita.

00:00:18.122 --> 00:00:19.208
Adelita was his turtle,

00:00:19.208 --> 00:00:22.928
and this 9,000-mile journey
was across the Pacific Ocean

00:00:22.928 --> 00:00:26.810
from Mexico, from the West
coast of Mexico, to Japan,

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:28.645
so let's see what they're talking about.

00:00:33.815 --> 00:00:36.280
Well, she couldn't have used
the North Atlantic gyre.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:38.255
They do talk about that
later on in the passage

00:00:38.255 --> 00:00:39.962
as ways that turtles in the Atlantic

00:00:39.962 --> 00:00:41.907
navigate across the Atlantic,

00:00:41.907 --> 00:00:44.141
but Adelita, though, what
the passage started with,

00:00:44.141 --> 00:00:46.122
she was navigating across the Pacific,

00:00:46.122 --> 00:00:47.953
so she's not gonna be using the current

00:00:47.953 --> 00:00:49.982
of the North Atlantic gyre.

00:00:55.468 --> 00:00:57.613
Well, they definitely talk
about electromagnetic coils

00:00:57.613 --> 00:01:00.281
designed by Putman and
Lohmann in the passage,

00:01:00.281 --> 00:01:02.376
and these researches used those coils

00:01:02.376 --> 00:01:04.836
to test whether turtles

00:01:04.836 --> 00:01:06.723
respond to it,

00:01:06.723 --> 00:01:08.700
that it effects their sense of direction,

00:01:08.700 --> 00:01:12.328
but Adelita didn't use the cues
from electromagnetic coils.

00:01:12.328 --> 00:01:13.887
It's not like Putman and
Lohmann were on a boat

00:01:13.887 --> 00:01:15.333
for 9,000 miles with,

00:01:15.333 --> 00:01:17.826
kind of, electromagnetic
coils near Adelita

00:01:17.826 --> 00:01:19.556
and using that to tell Adelita

00:01:19.556 --> 00:01:22.489
how does she navigate
her 9,000 mile journey.

00:01:22.489 --> 00:01:24.547
It's not like she had
access to these things.

00:01:24.547 --> 00:01:26.035
She did it on her own.

00:01:30.393 --> 00:01:32.412
Well, yeah, well that's what
the whole passage is about.

00:01:32.412 --> 00:01:33.604
It kind of starts off with,

00:01:33.604 --> 00:01:35.891
isn't it amazing that
this turtle can navigate

00:01:35.891 --> 00:01:38.258
this 9,000 mile journey on its own

00:01:38.258 --> 00:01:40.492
without some type of a GPS device.

00:01:40.492 --> 00:01:43.118
And then it uses the research
of Putman and Lohmann

00:01:43.118 --> 00:01:44.673
to show that turtles are able to do this

00:01:44.673 --> 00:01:47.102
by using the inclination intensity

00:01:47.102 --> 00:01:49.018
of Earth's magnetic field,

00:01:49.018 --> 00:01:50.324
so that looks right.

00:01:50.324 --> 00:01:51.733
Now, let's look at the last choice.

00:01:54.699 --> 00:01:56.166
Well, once again, this is like choice B.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.018
Adelita did not have access to technology

00:01:59.018 --> 00:02:01.320
from the researcher or Lohmann,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.883
so this is...

00:02:02.883 --> 00:02:04.595
She was off by herself in the Pacific.

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:06.401
All right, number two.

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:12.984
So, once again, the answer
to the previous question

00:02:12.984 --> 00:02:15.677
is that turtles use the
inclination and intensity

00:02:15.677 --> 00:02:17.547
of Earth's magnetic field.

00:02:17.547 --> 00:02:20.248
So, what's the best evidence
for us to feel good about that?

00:02:20.248 --> 00:02:22.795
That turtles actually do use
the inclination and intensity

00:02:22.795 --> 00:02:24.236
of Earth's magnetic field

00:02:24.236 --> 00:02:26.252
to navigate across the Pacific,

00:02:26.252 --> 00:02:28.355
or to navigate across an ocean.

00:02:31.945 --> 00:02:34.048
Let's see, lines one through three.

00:02:35.062 --> 00:02:37.082
So this is line one right over here.

00:02:37.082 --> 00:02:38.270
They give us every fifth line.

00:02:46.551 --> 00:02:48.247
Yeah, this is what they started off with.

00:02:48.247 --> 00:02:49.149
It was an amazing statement.

00:02:49.149 --> 00:02:50.029
This was kind of

00:02:50.029 --> 00:02:51.620
starts to serve the problem to it.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:52.581
Like, isn't this amazing?

00:02:52.581 --> 00:02:53.489
But how does this happen?

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.436
But this doesn't give evidence or explain

00:02:55.436 --> 00:02:59.315
why or how they use the
inclination and intensity

00:03:00.055 --> 00:03:01.839
so let me scroll back.

00:03:02.166 --> 00:03:04.634
That doesn't give evidence
that they use the inclination

00:03:04.634 --> 00:03:06.614
and intensity of Earth's magnetic field,

00:03:06.614 --> 00:03:08.737
so I'm gonna cross that one out.

00:03:11.928 --> 00:03:15.104
Let's see, lines 30 to 32.

00:03:15.723 --> 00:03:19.542
Let's see, lines 30 to 32.

00:03:29.002 --> 00:03:31.366
Well, we later do use this,

00:03:31.366 --> 00:03:34.267
you know, Lohmann uses this technology

00:03:34.267 --> 00:03:35.613
that he's developed

00:03:35.613 --> 00:03:37.908
to test whether turtles respond

00:03:37.908 --> 00:03:40.123
but this sentence by itself
isn't providing evidence.

00:03:40.123 --> 00:03:41.556
It's just starting to say that hey Lohmann

00:03:41.556 --> 00:03:43.747
can mimic magnetic
fields at different parts

00:03:43.747 --> 00:03:44.769
of the Earth's surface,

00:03:44.769 --> 00:03:46.156
so I don't think that this is...

00:03:46.156 --> 00:03:47.581
I don't think this is evidence either.

00:03:47.581 --> 00:03:48.988
I'm sorry, I have to
kind of keep scrolling

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:50.678
back and forth like this.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.852
Let's see,

00:03:55.852 --> 00:03:58.517
53 to 55.

00:03:59.501 --> 00:04:01.308
53 to 55.

00:04:01.308 --> 00:04:03.230
So, let's see, that's
this right over here.

00:04:11.929 --> 00:04:13.300
Well, if we remember,
this is when they said,

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:14.084
"Look,

00:04:14.084 --> 00:04:15.892
"the turtles use the magnetic field

00:04:15.892 --> 00:04:17.850
"and they might also
use this other stuff."

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:20.861
"You know, the stars, the
position of the sea, sun and stars

00:04:20.861 --> 00:04:23.199
"might also help them," but
once again this isn't evidence

00:04:23.199 --> 00:04:27.455
for us believing that they
use Earth's magnetic field.

00:04:27.455 --> 00:04:30.206
These are just other
things that they might use.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:32.638
So, let me just cross that one out.

00:04:33.286 --> 00:04:36.077
So, deductive reasoning,
it's probably gonna be D,

00:04:36.077 --> 00:04:37.499
but let's check it out.

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.897
Line 64,

00:04:42.539 --> 00:04:45.711
64 to 67, starting with, "Neither,"

00:04:45.711 --> 00:04:47.499
so that's right near the end.

00:04:51.497 --> 00:04:52.516
And when they're saying, "neither,"

00:04:52.516 --> 00:04:55.346
they're talking about
different parts of the world

00:04:55.346 --> 00:04:57.862
have unique combinations
of these two variables,

00:04:57.862 --> 00:05:00.159
and those two variables are the intensity,

00:05:00.159 --> 00:05:02.614
the intensity of the magnetic field,

00:05:02.614 --> 00:05:04.902
and the angle of the magnetic field,

00:05:04.902 --> 00:05:07.288
so neither corresponds directly to either

00:05:07.288 --> 00:05:08.247
latitude or longitude.

00:05:08.247 --> 00:05:09.000
And when they're saying, "neither,"

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.830
they're saying neither the
intensity or the angle.

00:05:10.830 --> 00:05:13.712
But together, they provide
a magnetic signature

00:05:13.712 --> 00:05:15.998
that tells the turtle where it is.

00:05:16.396 --> 00:05:17.892
So, this is the closest that I would say

00:05:17.892 --> 00:05:19.753
to actually providing evidence

00:05:19.753 --> 00:05:22.413
that turtles, that the angle and intensity

00:05:22.413 --> 00:05:25.537
of a magnetic field can
provide a signature to turtles

00:05:25.537 --> 00:05:28.762
to tell them where they are.

00:05:29.085 --> 00:05:30.309
So I like that one.

00:05:30.309 --> 00:05:31.949
It's actually the best of all of these,

00:05:31.949 --> 00:05:34.101
so I would go with D.

00:05:39.467 --> 00:05:41.650
All right, let's check out line three.

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.932
Used in line three.

00:05:58.561 --> 00:06:00.432
So, he put a tag on this turtle

00:06:00.432 --> 00:06:02.093
and this was able to track it.

00:06:02.093 --> 00:06:03.137
So, let's see.

00:06:06.507 --> 00:06:08.290
Followed, not hunted.

00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:09.559
He's not trying to kill the turtles,

00:06:09.559 --> 00:06:11.138
or anything.

00:06:11.138 --> 00:06:13.970
It's not like he's
traveling over the turtle,

00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:15.318
and it's not like he's...

00:06:15.318 --> 00:06:16.596
He's not searching for the turtle.

00:06:16.596 --> 00:06:17.680
He actually knows where the turtle is

00:06:17.680 --> 00:06:19.870
because he has a satellite tag on it.

00:06:19.870 --> 00:06:21.493
So he followed the turtle.

00:06:30.214 --> 00:06:32.096
Well, they seem to validate each other.

00:06:32.096 --> 00:06:33.523
They were both working on magnetic fields

00:06:33.523 --> 00:06:34.834
and how magnetic fields

00:06:34.834 --> 00:06:37.413
can be used by turtles to navigate.

00:06:40.519 --> 00:06:42.456
No, that's not the case.

00:06:44.467 --> 00:06:46.689
So, this one seems interesting.

00:06:46.689 --> 00:06:48.581
I'm actually gonna go back to the passage

00:06:48.581 --> 00:06:50.747
to make sure that it was
Putman building on Lohmann

00:06:50.747 --> 00:06:52.779
versus Lohmann building on Putman.

00:06:55.771 --> 00:06:58.063
This could be interesting as well.

00:06:59.994 --> 00:07:01.607
It wasn't like, I mean,

00:07:01.607 --> 00:07:02.985
the passage said that Putman's research

00:07:02.985 --> 00:07:03.995
was wrong,

00:07:03.995 --> 00:07:05.738
so we can rule these two out,

00:07:05.738 --> 00:07:07.701
but let's revisit the
passage a little bit,

00:07:07.701 --> 00:07:09.519
just so that we can
make sure we understand

00:07:10.759 --> 00:07:12.132
the work.

00:07:12.132 --> 00:07:13.873
So, they told us,

00:07:13.873 --> 00:07:17.980
how did she, Adelita,
steer across two oceans

00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:19.660
to find her destination?

00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:21.443
It says Putnam has the answer.

00:07:35.266 --> 00:07:37.171
So Ken Lohmann is his advisor.

00:07:37.171 --> 00:07:38.458
He's his mentor.

00:07:38.458 --> 00:07:39.792
So, I'm starting to feel

00:07:39.792 --> 00:07:42.610
that he probably built on
the work of Ken Lohmann,

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.654
'cause Lohmann has been
studying the magnetic abilities

00:07:45.654 --> 00:07:48.163
of loggerheads for over 20 years!

00:07:48.821 --> 00:07:51.324
So, Putman is a junior researcher,

00:07:51.324 --> 00:07:52.327
so I think

00:07:52.327 --> 00:07:54.956
he's building on the work.

00:07:54.956 --> 00:07:57.946
He's building on the work of Lohmann.

00:07:57.946 --> 00:07:59.576
He works in Lohmann's lab.

00:07:59.576 --> 00:08:01.144
Lohmann's been doing this for 20 years.

00:08:08.274 --> 00:08:10.040
So, let's see where they do that.

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:11.341
Line 49.

00:08:11.672 --> 00:08:12.713
Reed.

00:08:13.171 --> 00:08:14.335
So, let's see.

00:08:25.894 --> 00:08:26.525
All right,

00:08:26.525 --> 00:08:27.629
so they're giving these other examples

00:08:27.629 --> 00:08:29.604
to say, "Hey, like, turtles
are not the only ones

00:08:29.604 --> 00:08:30.884
"that have this mysterious ability."

00:08:34.936 --> 00:08:36.813
No, that's not what they're trying to do.

00:08:40.512 --> 00:08:42.179
Yeah, this is feeling pretty good.

00:08:46.299 --> 00:08:47.278
No, they're not saying most animals,

00:08:47.278 --> 00:08:49.342
they're just saying there
are some other animal species

00:08:49.342 --> 00:08:50.784
that have this amazing ability,

00:08:50.784 --> 00:08:52.586
so they're not saying that most species.

00:08:52.586 --> 00:08:54.813
Let me just cross it out like this.

00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:00.656
No, they're not saying that the

00:09:00.656 --> 00:09:02.511
reed warbler or the sparrow,

00:09:02.511 --> 00:09:04.337
because they can travel long distance,

00:09:04.337 --> 00:09:06.662
are able to do this or
that or find more food.

00:09:06.662 --> 00:09:08.787
They're just saying, "Hey,
turtles are not the only one.

00:09:08.787 --> 00:09:10.464
"There's other species that also

00:09:10.464 --> 00:09:11.701
can do this."

00:09:11.701 --> 00:09:12.837
So, I'll cross that out.

00:09:12.837 --> 00:09:14.844
And I'd go with B.
