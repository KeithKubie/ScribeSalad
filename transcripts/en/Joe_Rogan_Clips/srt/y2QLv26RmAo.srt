1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:03,900
Pappy candy, which was actually
a fan. They did the Watergate,

2
00:00:03,930 --> 00:00:07,500
like they sat there and went deep like
all night, but he definitely a hunter,

3
00:00:07,501 --> 00:00:10,000
definitely shit on him. Oh, he
shit on him hard. That'd be cute.

4
00:00:10,030 --> 00:00:13,440
Shit back on him hard. The first night
they met was at the Nixon, um, at the,

5
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:15,300
at the um,
holiday inn in um,

6
00:00:15,390 --> 00:00:18,990
1968 in New Hampshire during
Nixon's come back campaign.

7
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:22,500
And Thompson walks in and Pat Kenny goes,

8
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:26,820
who's this damn guy with the damn ski
jacket walking through our Goddamn lobby

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:29,610
and tops. It's like, I have a press
pass, like I'm here to do this.

10
00:00:29,611 --> 00:00:31,530
And so they like have this big moment.

11
00:00:31,531 --> 00:00:34,180
And then later on that night
Thompson goes to a party with, um,

12
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:36,630
campaign people and with um,
uh,

13
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:40,320
[inaudible] and he brings a big
bottle of wild Turkey. And so we can,

14
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,170
as a young journalist at the time, he
worked at the Saint Louis Post dispatch,

15
00:00:43,171 --> 00:00:46,210
I think he'd gone to the
Columbia Journalism School
is working for Nixon as his

16
00:00:46,211 --> 00:00:50,220
being policy guy. He looks at Toms, he's
like, that's the fucking, the ski. Oh,

17
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:52,710
you got a bottle of what? Oh, if you
gotta follow the old crow, like no,

18
00:00:52,711 --> 00:00:53,370
we'll drink that.

19
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:55,620
And so they stayed up all night and
they talked about the Vietnam War.

20
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:59,880
And Thompson talked about how it just
figures us to be in a foreign war that's

21
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,330
unjust and it destroys our
democratic ideals to be doing that.

22
00:01:03,331 --> 00:01:06,750
And bitcoin was like containment, nuclear
war. We're trying to get out of it.

23
00:01:06,751 --> 00:01:09,660
And they listened to each other till dawn,
like that first night that they met.

24
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:14,260
Now. What was your idea behind
writing this book? Like what,

25
00:01:14,261 --> 00:01:17,100
what compelled you?
I think we've mistaken Thompson.

26
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,350
I think that we see them more
as like a Doonesbury character.

27
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:21,120
I think people who know
him really well don't.

28
00:01:21,121 --> 00:01:25,260
But I think that most people through
whatever cultural forces that we've had,

29
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:27,110
well the boys,

30
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:30,180
cause a lot of people don't know
the comparison what the Doonesbury.

31
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:33,310
So I think in the eighties or
seventies, eighties, nineties, um,

32
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:36,600
that cartoon Doonesbury by
Gary Trudeau, it became, um,

33
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:38,280
there was a character
on it called Uncle Duke.

34
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:40,200
And Uncle Duke was based
on Hunter Thompson.

35
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:43,230
And he was kind of an exaggerated
version of Hunter Thompson.

36
00:01:43,231 --> 00:01:46,070
He was a cartoonish version
of hunters Thompson.

37
00:01:46,071 --> 00:01:50,520
And I think Terry Gilliam did a
wonderful and kind of our tourist job on,

38
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:53,940
um, like a brilliant job on
fear and loathing in Las Vegas.

39
00:01:53,941 --> 00:01:56,800
But that's also an exaggerated
version of Hunter Thompson.

40
00:01:56,801 --> 00:02:01,050
And we forget today the amount of work
on Hunter Thompson did the effort he put

41
00:02:01,051 --> 00:02:01,261
out,

42
00:02:01,261 --> 00:02:04,710
we forget that he was a
straight journalist or he did
the freelance assignments.

43
00:02:04,711 --> 00:02:07,350
He wrote the straight articles for
years to make money for his family.

44
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,530
And it wasn't until he
had his breakthrough with
hell's angels that he could

45
00:02:10,531 --> 00:02:13,290
develop the style that
we identify with today.

46
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:17,490
And so it kills me that we identify him
more as a clown or like a, you know,

47
00:02:17,491 --> 00:02:21,660
more as a cartoonish figure as opposed
to a very serious political pinker,

48
00:02:21,730 --> 00:02:26,550
political activist and serious writer
who can give us insight into the fucking

49
00:02:26,551 --> 00:02:29,460
shit show we experience
every moment today. Well,

50
00:02:29,461 --> 00:02:32,760
I think the perception
of him is fairly nuanced.

51
00:02:32,850 --> 00:02:35,640
I don't think that everybody thinks
of them as a cartoon character,

52
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:38,220
although particularly
later on in this life,

53
00:02:39,150 --> 00:02:42,720
he was relegated to that because he
really didn't speak well, you know,

54
00:02:42,721 --> 00:02:47,640
later on in his life when he was just
the drugs taken over phone and the owl

55
00:02:47,670 --> 00:02:49,320
because his son writes about the alcohol.

56
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:53,490
One writes so beautifully about the toll.
Alcoholism took on a hunter s Thompson.

57
00:02:53,491 --> 00:02:57,000
We couldn't talk anymore. I mean,
when he was deep into his sixties,

58
00:02:57,060 --> 00:02:59,560
his heart bars,
those are just tired of that.

59
00:02:59,860 --> 00:03:01,900
It was so hard to even understand them.

60
00:03:02,110 --> 00:03:07,110
There's a awful piece that he did with
Conan O'brien where Conan went to a woody

61
00:03:07,691 --> 00:03:09,300
creek and shotguns,
uh,

62
00:03:09,400 --> 00:03:13,390
off the back porch with them and you
could barely understand a fucking word

63
00:03:13,391 --> 00:03:14,140
hunter saying.

64
00:03:14,140 --> 00:03:17,980
That's why I tried to end it with Nixon
leaving because it was really sad when

65
00:03:17,981 --> 00:03:20,950
Nixon resigned. A Hunter Thompson
was at the Connecticut Hilton,

66
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:24,070
which is a hotel right by the
White House. Any Liebowitz, um,

67
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:27,280
the photographer with rolling
stone was calling him and saying,

68
00:03:27,520 --> 00:03:30,790
we need to get to the White House.
Nixon is a leaving.

69
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:34,990
Like he's going to get on the helicopter
and Thompson just laid in the grass and

70
00:03:34,991 --> 00:03:37,870
he didn't go, you know,
and that was heartbreaking.

71
00:03:37,871 --> 00:03:40,330
And he didn't end up writing the
eight page spread that he needed to.

72
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:44,730
Instead it became any Liebowitz is
photography, which was a famous and um,

73
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:47,050
in retrospect,
like huge move for her career.

74
00:03:47,051 --> 00:03:51,220
But I think that that pain right there
of thinking that he'd spent 10 years,

75
00:03:51,221 --> 00:03:53,740
I mean, he hated Nixon since
the checkers speech, you know,

76
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:55,750
and Nixon was the VP for Eisenhower.

77
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,400
He hated Nixon since 1962 when
Nixon lost the, um, California, um,

78
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:04,840
uh, uh, governor I'm ship
and said, you and the press,

79
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:07,330
you been giving me the shaft for so long,

80
00:04:07,331 --> 00:04:09,640
like you won't have Dick
Nixon to kick around anymore.

81
00:04:09,910 --> 00:04:12,250
Like Thompson had seen that
Nixon was somebody who said,

82
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:17,210
I'm just the poor son of a butcher. I'm
just this like very hardworking, you know,

83
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:21,340
American that represents all
of us were be hind that like,

84
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:25,210
he was a politically, um, you know,

85
00:04:25,211 --> 00:04:29,170
ravenous monster who was anticommunist,
who would go to any extent to win.

86
00:04:29,470 --> 00:04:33,760
And Thompson saw that. And Thompson knew
that other people saw it. And in 1964,

87
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:36,040
the Barry Goldwater
convention in San Francisco,

88
00:04:36,440 --> 00:04:40,390
my favorite lead named arena of
all time, the cow palace, um,

89
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,850
Barry Goldwater was going to
speak to accept the nomination.

90
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:45,160
And what happened was,
and Nixon was introducing them,

91
00:04:45,220 --> 00:04:46,930
it was Nixon's way back
from the wilderness.

92
00:04:47,260 --> 00:04:50,260
Thompson was a few rows back cause the
first time Thompson I think was that

93
00:04:50,261 --> 00:04:53,680
close to see him live. And it makes, it's
like, you know, poor son of a butcher,

94
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:57,370
don't think about me, just think about
Barry Goldwater, Mr Conservative,

95
00:04:57,371 --> 00:04:59,470
he'll become Mr president.
And Thompson was like,

96
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:02,530
fuck everybody here knows he's lying.

97
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:06,190
But they think that that act of lying
is a skill and the way they used car

98
00:05:06,191 --> 00:05:09,430
salesman who lies but can make a lot
of money off it, right. Skillful,

99
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,850
the way that Trump by selling steaks to
people and then they go bankrupt and he

100
00:05:12,851 --> 00:05:13,540
gets rich.

101
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:17,230
That's an American skill and Thompson
sense that from the start with Nixon.

102
00:05:17,620 --> 00:05:21,100
And so I think he battled against
Nixon for a decade, for a lot of years.

103
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:23,620
And when Nixon left,
I think he felt spent.

104
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,090
And so I try not to focus on the later
I ended then in [inaudible] 74 because I

105
00:05:28,091 --> 00:05:32,530
think it's, he wrote some beautiful things
afterwards. He was still a gratefully,

106
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:36,160
you definitely had some moments where
he decided to not do the assignment that

107
00:05:36,161 --> 00:05:38,560
he was supposed to do.
And it was kind of sad.

108
00:05:38,890 --> 00:05:42,820
Like I'm the Ali foreman fight,
fucking floated in the pool,

109
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:45,050
float in the pool with a Nixon mask on,

110
00:05:45,070 --> 00:05:48,600
flew all the way to Africa and ms
one of the greatest sports moments.

111
00:05:48,610 --> 00:05:51,850
It was like game six of
'em, you know, um, you know,

112
00:05:51,851 --> 00:05:55,780
the Boston red sox versus the reds or
think Ali was something different to

113
00:05:55,781 --> 00:05:58,210
people than I think it's,
I

114
00:05:58,220 --> 00:06:00,410
don't think we have
someone like that today.

115
00:06:00,411 --> 00:06:04,850
So it's very difficult for
us to understand if people
today look at Ali and they

116
00:06:04,851 --> 00:06:09,560
go, oh, he was a heavyweight boxing
champion. He was way more than that.

117
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:10,570
He was,
uh,

118
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:15,680
a cultural figure that represented
the resistance to the Vietnam War and

119
00:06:15,860 --> 00:06:20,480
represented it with the biggest loss
that any public figure it ever shown.

120
00:06:20,630 --> 00:06:25,630
And willingly gave up three years of his
career in his prime from age 27 to 30,

121
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:30,410
from 1967 from the Cleveland
Big Cat Williams fight.

122
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:35,060
He didn't fight again for three years.
He didn't train,

123
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:37,500
he didn't do anything. They
kept him from his career. Why?

124
00:06:37,590 --> 00:06:40,520
When he was in his prime, when he
was the best heavyweight of all time.

125
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:46,180
And he spoke publicly and often and
in we was fucking hated all over the

126
00:06:46,701 --> 00:06:49,700
country, but he represented
something different. Like, uh,

127
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:53,390
my parents were hippies and
when I was a little kid,

128
00:06:53,600 --> 00:06:57,500
he lost to Leon Spinks and
the rematch was on television.

129
00:06:58,010 --> 00:07:03,010
My parents never watched TV and they
definitely never watched boxing and they,

130
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,100
they, they sat in front of that TV
to watch that. I remember thinking,

131
00:07:07,101 --> 00:07:10,880
I can't believe my parents want to watch
a boxing match. Like this is crazy.

132
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:12,920
And I was probably like,
I don't know,

133
00:07:12,921 --> 00:07:15,110
maybe eight or nine years
old or something at the time.

134
00:07:15,290 --> 00:07:16,250
And I just remember thinking,

135
00:07:16,251 --> 00:07:20,660
I can't believe my parents want to watch
a boxing match. And that's what really,

136
00:07:20,661 --> 00:07:25,661
when it sunk into me at a really early
age that this guy was not just this

137
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:30,740
heavyweight boxer. He was,
he was, uh, a cultural icon.

138
00:07:30,741 --> 00:07:35,030
He was a historical figure.
He meant he meant a lot into hunter.

139
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:36,920
He met a lot.
He meant something,

140
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:41,270
something much bigger
than just just a boxer.

141
00:07:41,271 --> 00:07:43,910
And so hunter thought he was
going to a death sentence.

142
00:07:44,210 --> 00:07:48,260
George Foreman had crushed Joe
Frazier. He crushed everybody. I mean,

143
00:07:48,261 --> 00:07:52,820
he was so powerful. George Foreman
to this day is one of the all time,

144
00:07:52,821 --> 00:07:55,910
scariest heavyweights of all
time with without a doubt. He,

145
00:07:56,140 --> 00:08:00,950
he could hit so fucking hard and
literally pick guys off their feet.

146
00:08:00,951 --> 00:08:05,900
He hit Joe Frazier and lifted him
off his feet with a punch. And uh,

147
00:08:06,260 --> 00:08:08,720
everybody was convinced that
that was going to happen to Ali,

148
00:08:08,721 --> 00:08:11,150
that Ali had been past its prime.
And look,

149
00:08:11,151 --> 00:08:14,090
just look at what George
Foreman had done to Joe Frazier.

150
00:08:14,091 --> 00:08:18,320
What is he going to do to Muhammad Ali
and Ali just rope a dope them until he

151
00:08:18,321 --> 00:08:20,840
got tired and then fucked him
up in front of the whole world.

152
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:21,980
That's one of the greatest

153
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:26,910
athletic moments. I mean we forget that
athletes, athletes like curt flood,

154
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,790
you know, they've, they risked who's that?

155
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:33,630
Curt flood was the American baseball
player who challenged the reserve clause

156
00:08:33,870 --> 00:08:38,250
cause it makes, while you weren't allowed
to, um, get free agency for another team.

157
00:08:38,251 --> 00:08:39,900
And curt flood was this
great player and he was like,

158
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,510
I'm going to sit out and I'm going to
wait. Athletes like Colin Kaepernick,

159
00:08:42,870 --> 00:08:43,800
they've sacrificed her career.

160
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:48,000
It's not the same with Muhammad Ali who
was like Babe Ruth and Barry bonds and

161
00:08:48,001 --> 00:08:52,080
like everybody combined at that one
moment. Right? But he was risking,

162
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:53,130
it's the opposite of Trump.

163
00:08:53,131 --> 00:08:57,780
Trump used his celebrity to become this
even more mangled version of himself and

164
00:08:57,781 --> 00:09:02,460
get more power while he used his celebrity
to speak for his virtue in his value

165
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:05,520
and his beliefs and set like Thomson
was really good at understanding what

166
00:09:05,521 --> 00:09:09,030
people sacrifice when people have
to give up the wager. You know,

167
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:12,420
between what that act will be, what
the results will be. They may be later.

168
00:09:12,421 --> 00:09:13,470
But he knew that.

169
00:09:13,471 --> 00:09:17,850
And so his respect for Ali for
giving up those years of his prime,

170
00:09:18,210 --> 00:09:19,620
you know, was, was enduring.

171
00:09:19,650 --> 00:09:23,850
He Keep Thompson came back from that
fight and he gave his son on one a boxing

172
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:27,990
gloves, um, that, um, or, or,
uh, at least boxing gloves. Wow.

173
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:30,300
Yeah.
It's a very,

174
00:09:30,301 --> 00:09:33,480
very unfortunate that he missed that fi
because it would have been fascinating

175
00:09:33,481 --> 00:09:34,800
to hear his take on it.
To me.

176
00:09:34,801 --> 00:09:38,130
I'm sure he would've been so moved
when he saw all the win, but it was in,

177
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:39,870
I mean that's a good point.
It was indicative of,

178
00:09:39,871 --> 00:09:44,010
I think the stress and the pressure that
the last decade of covering Nixon had

179
00:09:44,011 --> 00:09:47,250
taken out on him. Well, there's a
little bit of that, but let's be honest,

180
00:09:47,251 --> 00:09:49,260
he was also kind of a fuck up.
I mean,

181
00:09:49,261 --> 00:09:53,080
when he was writing for rolling stone
and they gave him that, that early facts.

182
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:57,120
Oh yeah. And he would fuck that thing up.
He would unplug it and plug it back in.

183
00:09:57,121 --> 00:10:00,090
He would do it. Just so he could go to
the bar and say, this thing doesn't work.

184
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:03,060
But that was the end. I think of
his arc where he was still on point.

185
00:10:03,061 --> 00:10:05,490
He was still playing the role of a
serious journalist and he would use that

186
00:10:05,491 --> 00:10:08,760
persona as a fuckup and there's
letters by yawn winter being like,

187
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:12,720
you cannot turn in your articles
three hours before we go to press.

188
00:10:12,780 --> 00:10:15,870
I know you made it.
This doesn't fucking work.

189
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:18,900
And so he was beginning to break down.
Then he was also,

190
00:10:18,901 --> 00:10:22,800
I think on the tail end of his decade
of being a journalist who had met every

191
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:26,310
deadline so that he could fucking feed
his family and he could afford how farm

192
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:27,060
like there were.

193
00:10:27,060 --> 00:10:32,060
There's moments where before he got the
contract for Hell's angels in 1965 he

194
00:10:32,701 --> 00:10:34,020
was ready to be like a longshoreman.

195
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:37,230
He was going and looking for work in
the mornings in San Francisco, you know,

196
00:10:37,231 --> 00:10:38,460
to try to support his family.

197
00:10:38,461 --> 00:10:41,850
He was willing to give up writing and
instead that article blew up and he,

198
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,540
all these beautiful letters
began to arrive at three
19 Parnassus where he lived

199
00:10:45,541 --> 00:10:49,140
at, um, at the top of the Haight
Ashbury and I'm San Francisco.

200
00:10:49,590 --> 00:10:52,050
And that opened up his chance
to continue being a writer,

201
00:10:52,051 --> 00:10:54,750
but money was the main motivating factor.

202
00:10:54,751 --> 00:10:57,690
And so I think once money like unfurled,

203
00:10:57,691 --> 00:11:01,740
once alcoholism I think took its toll
and once he couldn't walk around anymore

204
00:11:01,950 --> 00:11:05,310
addict political camp convention without
people just like grabbing his shoulder

205
00:11:05,311 --> 00:11:07,380
and saying, you're a hunter
Thompson, does that happen?

206
00:11:07,381 --> 00:11:09,180
I think things began to change.
Yeah.

207
00:11:09,181 --> 00:11:11,550
That's one of the things that he
talked about that I thought was really

208
00:11:11,551 --> 00:11:15,210
interesting that he became
a part of the story.

209
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:18,960
It wasn't just that he was covering
stories, he couldn't be anonymous anymore.

210
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:23,610
He was in many cases more famous than
the people that he was covering. Yeah.

211
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:26,910
You know, like when he would go
to meet Nixon, all Nick Nixon,

212
00:11:26,980 --> 00:11:30,120
secret service agents wanted to meet
him and they wanted to get an autograph

213
00:11:30,121 --> 00:11:33,710
from him and shake his hand and it
was just too weird. Everything I got.

214
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,320
And then there's the
alcoholism, alcoholism. Look it,

215
00:11:38,490 --> 00:11:42,000
it's a depressant. It wrecks you.
And if you read, you know, we,

216
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:46,380
me and Greg Fitzsimmons on
a podcast once read off, uh,

217
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:51,390
that one journalist who had a
detailed hunters daily routine.

218
00:11:51,810 --> 00:11:55,180
And so we, we read the routine
and they put a techno beat to it.

219
00:11:55,181 --> 00:11:58,840
It's fucking hilarious. That was
a bad, that's a set. Those are so,

220
00:11:58,841 --> 00:12:01,660
it's so funny because those
seem funny now, but they're,

221
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:06,130
they're kind of a death nail.
Like, I mean that, that daily
routine, um, that was, um,

222
00:12:06,280 --> 00:12:10,630
the, the biography hunter, it was in that
and it's just, it's heartbreaking. I mean,

223
00:12:10,631 --> 00:12:13,210
we've got to remember that the dedication
to fear and loathing in Las Vegas was

224
00:12:13,211 --> 00:12:16,320
he who makes a beast of
himself gets rid of pain man.

225
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,880
And I think the world was
painful for a Hunter Thompson.

226
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,240
It was people to see powerful
people abused the week, you know,

227
00:12:22,241 --> 00:12:25,540
and like take what they wanted brazenly
without being held accountable.

228
00:12:25,720 --> 00:12:28,690
I think it was hard to deal with shitty
editors who cut half your fucking essay

229
00:12:28,691 --> 00:12:29,980
on Nixon or half your story.

230
00:12:30,130 --> 00:12:32,830
It made it into something that had
nothing to do with the effort that you put

231
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:35,770
out. Yeah. I think it was hard
to pay your bills and you know,

232
00:12:35,771 --> 00:12:40,330
live the way that you wanted to live.
And I think a lot of that gets undermined.

233
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:43,810
I just want people to realize
how much effort he put out,

234
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:46,240
especially during those years
where he was like, all right,

235
00:12:46,270 --> 00:12:49,210
I want to be a great journalist.
I want to have a voice in our society.

236
00:12:49,450 --> 00:12:51,310
I want to participate in
our national conversation.

237
00:12:51,580 --> 00:12:55,480
My only path towards that is to work
harder than everybody else to be at places

238
00:12:55,481 --> 00:12:58,330
when things happen, when they matter.
And he's sacrificed a lot for that.

239
00:12:58,331 --> 00:13:01,630
But he was there and he's a voice in a
light that we can have in this moment. Um,

240
00:13:01,631 --> 00:13:03,550
which is another troubling
moment in American history.
