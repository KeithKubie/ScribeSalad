00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:05.260
Simplify xy to the
negative 2 power times 2x

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:09.270
squared over y squared
to the fourth power.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.440
So let's see what
we can do over here.

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:14.480
So let's think about this
part of our expression first.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:18.790
If I have x over y
to the n-th power,

00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:23.220
we know that this is the same
thing as x to the n-th over y

00:00:23.220 --> 00:00:24.360
to the n-th.

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.270
So let's apply that
right over here.

00:00:26.270 --> 00:00:29.380
So this expression, 2x squared
over y squared to the fourth,

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.870
this is going to be the
same thing as 2x squared

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:40.970
to the fourth power over y
squared to the fourth power.

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:42.960
And of course, we
still have our xy

00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:45.590
to the negative
2 power out here.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:47.420
And actually, let me
simplify that as well.

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:53.590
We know that if we have x
times y to the n-th power,

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:56.960
this is the same thing as taking
each of the powers of each

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.680
of the x and the y and
then taking the product.

00:00:59.680 --> 00:01:03.075
This is x to the n
times y to the n.

00:01:03.075 --> 00:01:04.660
And actually, if
you just expand--

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.800
if you multiply
xy times itself n

00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.720
times you'll see why
this actually works out

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.730
because you'll have x multiplied
by itself x times if you

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:16.260
rearrange the product and y
multiplied by itself n times.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:17.830
So if we use that
same property here,

00:01:17.830 --> 00:01:20.310
xy to the negative
2, that's going

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.560
to be the same exact thing
as x to the negative 2 times

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:27.780
y to the negative 2.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.180
Now what can we simplify?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.900
Well, we can use this property
again right over here.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:34.720
We have 2x squared raised
to the fourth power.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.150
So that's going to be
the same thing as 2

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:45.530
to the fourth power times x
squared to the fourth power.

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.320
And we can do it
in the denominator.

00:01:47.320 --> 00:01:49.410
y squared to the fourth
power-- actually,

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:51.868
we're going to use a different
property in the denominator.

00:01:51.868 --> 00:01:53.710
We just have y squared
to the fourth power.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.950
We know that if
we have x to the n

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.390
and then raise that
to the m-th power,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.750
this is the same thing
as x to the n times m.

00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:04.447
So y squared and
then raising that

00:02:04.447 --> 00:02:06.030
to the fourth power
that's going to be

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:09.270
equal to y to the
2 times 4 power,

00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:13.130
or y to the eighth power.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:16.620
And of course, out here we
have x to the negative 2 times

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:18.420
y to the negative 2.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.340
Now, let's think a little bit
about what x to the negative 2

00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:23.290
and y to the negative 2 mean.

00:02:23.290 --> 00:02:27.210
x to the negative 2 just
means 1 over x squared.

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:31.430
y to the negative 2 just
means 1 over y squared.

00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:32.960
So let's rewrite it like that.

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.170
So this is the same thing
as 1 over x squared times 1

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:40.250
over y squared.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:43.710
So we could just write that
as 1 over x squared y squared.

00:02:43.710 --> 00:02:45.897
That and that are
completely equivalent.

00:02:45.897 --> 00:02:47.230
So let's see what we can do now.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:49.522
So we have one last
thing we could-- well,

00:02:49.522 --> 00:02:50.730
we don't have one last thing.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.590
We have a few more
things to worry about.

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:54.750
We have x squared and
then we're raising that

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:55.730
to the fourth power.

00:02:55.730 --> 00:02:58.250
Once again, we can use
this property right here.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:02.100
This is going to be x
to the 2 times 4 power.

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:05.254
So this part right over here--
I'll do it in a new color.

00:03:05.254 --> 00:03:06.670
This part right
over here is going

00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.790
to simplify to x to the
eighth power 2 times 4.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.380
This part right over here is
going to 2 to the fourth power.

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:19.430
To the third is 8 so
2 to the fourth is 16.

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.420
So that is 16.

00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:23.820
And so our whole expression
has now simplified to--

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:25.272
and if we multiply
it times this,

00:03:25.272 --> 00:03:26.730
we multiply it
times 1 so I'm going

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:28.660
to multiply these two fractions.

00:03:28.660 --> 00:03:32.020
My numerator 16 times
x to the eighth.

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:38.140
And all of that over
I have x squared.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:44.217
And then I'm going to
have a y squared times a y

00:03:44.217 --> 00:03:44.800
to the eighth.

00:03:44.800 --> 00:03:46.780
What is y squared
times y to the eighth?

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:49.790
y squared times y to the eighth.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.120
We have the same base so
we can add the exponents.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:53.828
We're taking the
product so it's to going

00:03:53.828 --> 00:03:57.350
to be y to the 2 plus 8,
or y to the 10th power.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:03:59.310
So y squared times
y the eighth is

00:03:59.310 --> 00:04:02.790
going to be y to the 10th power.

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:03.950
And we're almost there.

00:04:03.950 --> 00:04:05.630
We have one more
thing we can simplify.

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.750
We have x to the
eighth over x squared.

00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:11.202
And we know-- I'll just write
the general property-- if we

00:04:11.202 --> 00:04:16.750
have x to the m over
x to the n, this

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:21.620
is equal to x to
the m minus n power.

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:25.450
So x to the eighth over x
squared, that over there

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:30.290
will simplify to x to
the 8 minus 2 power

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:33.310
or x to the sixth power.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:40.000
And so our whole expression has
now simplified to 16 times x

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:46.380
to the sixth all of that
over y to the 10th power.

00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.110
And we are done.
