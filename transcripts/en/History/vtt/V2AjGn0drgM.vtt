00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:06.210
DANNY: A few months back, we
were approached by the World

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:08.040
Series of Poker folks.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:11.380
They wanted us to build a
custom chop that captures

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:13.540
the vibe of being a champion.

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:16.710
We were given 100%
complete freedom on this

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.380
build to do what we want to do.

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.040
So this thing is gonna be cool.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.380
But it ain't gonna
be a billboard.

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:24.750
And Ryan, he's got
a wicked paint job

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.920
that he's wrapping around the
whole concept of a cool gas

00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:30.580
tank that Shannon found

00:00:30.580 --> 00:00:34.580
Poke Jack is back in the shop
here today to see his bike.

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:36.170
What's happening, Jack?

00:00:36.170 --> 00:00:38.750
Man, I am so
excited about today.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:40.830
And I can't wait for
him to check it out.

00:00:40.830 --> 00:00:42.250
I know he's going to dig it.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.250
So Jack, tell me about
the purpose for this bike.

00:00:45.250 --> 00:00:49.420
We wanted the person riding
this bike to feel like a World

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:50.830
Series of Poker champion.

00:00:50.830 --> 00:00:53.830
You jump on, and ride
off into the sunset.

00:00:53.830 --> 00:00:55.750
MAN: I guarantee you
something here, man.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:00:57.420
You're not going to want
to give this thing away.

00:00:57.420 --> 00:00:58.880
No.
No, you're not.

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.380
Well, I might just
have to keep it.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.880
[laughter]

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.460
I'm having a hard time
handing it over right now.

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:06.580
Jack, you ready
to see this bike?

00:01:06.580 --> 00:01:07.620
Oh, I'm excited.

00:01:07.620 --> 00:01:09.290
Let's see it.

00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:12.750
Shannon, come on, brother,
roll that beautiful bike out.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:14.460
[engine sounds]

00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:18.210
Oh, listen to it.

00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:22.120
Oh, my goodness.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:24.040
[laughs] Whoa!

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:29.460
Unbelievable.

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.250
DANNY: To build the
ultimate champion's chop,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:33.920
Shannon started with a six-down
and three-out frame paired

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:35.540
with a 21-over
Sugar Bear front end

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:38.250
to make sure this baby
handles like a dream.

00:01:38.250 --> 00:01:41.460
125-cubic-inch motor,
beautiful diamond gas tank,

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:44.420
and custom-fitted pipes has her
looking and sounding mean when

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.460
she's cruising down the road.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.120
But this baby doesn't
only ride great,

00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.170
she also looks like
nothing you've ever seen.

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.420
Ryan took this paint
job to the next level.

00:01:52.420 --> 00:01:54.790
He started off with sleek
black face highlighted

00:01:54.790 --> 00:01:58.790
with a bright red pin stripe and
added amazing poker-inspired 3D

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.120
graphics to that rear fender.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.670
And no champion's bike is
complete without the World

00:02:03.670 --> 00:02:06.960
Series of Poker chips subtly
hidden underneath the seat.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:09.000
Man, this bike is so beautiful.

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.920
I'm already jealous
of whoever wins it.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.960
Man, this bike looks amazing.

00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.670
I mean, I want to put
my hands all over it.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:21.250
Like, this thing-- this thing
just looks unbelievable--

00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:25.960
the raised diamonds on
the gas tank, the WSOP.

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.880
Look at this.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.290
Look at the bracelet.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.120
This is the champion's bike.

00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:32.880
Nice.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:38.040
Shannon, walk Jack through the
mechanical side of this bike.

00:02:38.040 --> 00:02:40.540
Well, the frame is
a six down, three up.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:43.620
What that means is the way
the frame is, it's taller.

00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:47.120
So those down tubes have been
stretched six inches longer.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:49.040
And when he says three
out, a backbone is

00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:50.830
stretched three inches forward.

00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:53.000
So that makes the bike
taller and longer,

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.380
puts that old frame
out there, which allows

00:02:55.380 --> 00:02:56.620
for that beautiful front end.

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:59.540
The gas tank, it's
a one of a kind.

00:02:59.540 --> 00:03:00.830
It's not just the paint.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:03.960
It's raised so you
can kind of feel.

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:06.120
Oh, yeah, that is slick.

00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:07.540
This thing is
practically carved.

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:09.040
We started with the gas tank.

00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.750
That was the first one
that we've come across.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:12.580
And it's got, you know,
all the raised diamonds.

00:03:12.580 --> 00:03:14.710
And transitioning
that to the fender--

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:16.920
oh, I can't just make a
fender look like that.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.540
Once all the primer
was down and all

00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:20.750
the graphics were
laid out in primer,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.380
then I had everything
Cosmichromed.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.750
Wow.

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.920
So the whole bike,
the tank and the fender

00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:27.210
and the oil tank,
all were chrome

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.710
before I even started painting.

00:03:28.710 --> 00:03:30.540
All of these things,
I mean, they've

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:32.210
literally been sculpted.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.580
SHANNON: All the old designs
wanted to be like jewelry.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.920
So everything was very subtle.

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:37.250
This is a masterpiece.

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:38.080
SHANNON: Thank you.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:39.040
That's the [inaudible].

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.750
Try it on.
Try it on.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:41.580
See how it fits.

00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:42.670
Oh.

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:44.040
I thought you would never ask.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:45.420
[laughter]

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:46.670
Yeah.

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:47.750
You can even ride
it with a suit on.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:49.250
A suit?

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.620
You know, I might be an
executive during the day.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.620
But when it comes to
riding a motorcycle,

00:03:53.620 --> 00:03:55.210
nobody needs a jacket, right?

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:57.040
I mean, you know, who
needs a jacket when you're

00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.290
gonna ride something like this?

00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.290
Now try it out.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:01.080
[engine sounds]

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.880
There you go.

00:04:10.210 --> 00:04:11.790
I don't know if we're
gonna be able to keep Jack

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.210
away from this bike
long enough for them

00:04:13.210 --> 00:04:14.790
to give this baby away.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.210
She just came out gorgeous, man.

00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:18.750
We were dealt a challenge.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.790
We stepped up.

00:04:19.790 --> 00:04:21.210
We went all in.

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:22.620
As far as I'm concerned,
we hit the jackpot.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.460
Whoever wins that
bike, they really

00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:28.040
are going to feel
like a champion

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:29.580
riding that thing around--
- Oh, yeah.

00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.620
--no doubt.
