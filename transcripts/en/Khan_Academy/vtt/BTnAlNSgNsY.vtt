00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.750
Let's say I have an
angle ABC, and it

00:00:03.750 --> 00:00:05.400
looks something like this.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:09.670
So its vertex is going
to be at B. Maybe

00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:14.890
A sits right over here, and
C sits right over there.

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:22.620
And then also let's say that we
have another angle called DBA.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:26.210
I want to have the vertex
once again at B. So let's

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:27.420
say it looks like this.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:33.200
So this right over here is our
point D. That is our point D.

00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:39.000
And let's say that we know
that the measure of angle DBA

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.010
is equal to 40 degrees.

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:43.050
So this angle right
over here, its measure

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:45.340
is equal to 40 degrees.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:50.160
And let's say that we know
that the measure of angle ABC

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.635
is equal to 50 degrees.

00:00:55.447 --> 00:00:57.530
So there's a bunch of
interesting things happening

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:58.060
here.

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.220
The first interesting thing
that you might realize

00:01:00.220 --> 00:01:03.360
is that both of these
angles share a side.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:06.230
If you view these as rays-- they
could be lines, line segments,

00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.210
or rays-- but if you
view them as rays,

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.320
they both share this ray BA.

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:13.380
And when you have
two angles like this

00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:16.900
that share the same side, these
are called adjacent angles.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:21.650
Because the word "adjacent"
literally means next to.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.910
These are adjacent.

00:01:23.910 --> 00:01:26.342
They are adjacent angles.

00:01:26.342 --> 00:01:27.800
Now there's something
else that you

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.380
might notice that's
interesting here.

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:32.770
We know that the measure
of angle DBA is 40 degrees

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:35.540
and the measure of
angle ABC is 50 degrees.

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:40.351
And you might be able to guess
what the measure of angle DBC

00:01:40.351 --> 00:01:40.850
is.

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.029
If we drew a
protractor over here--

00:01:46.029 --> 00:01:47.070
I'm not going to draw it.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:49.270
It will make my
drawing all messy.

00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:51.089
Well, maybe I'll
draw it really fast.

00:01:51.089 --> 00:01:52.880
So if you had a protractor
right over here,

00:01:52.880 --> 00:01:55.190
clearly this is opening
up to 50 degrees.

00:01:55.190 --> 00:01:57.290
And this is going
another 40 degrees.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:02:01.820
So if you wanted to say what
the measure of angle DBC is,

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:04.982
it would essentially be the sum
of 40 degrees and 50 degrees.

00:02:04.982 --> 00:02:06.440
And let me delete
all of this stuff

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:07.773
right here to keep things clean.

00:02:07.773 --> 00:02:13.260
So the measure of angle DBC
would be equal to 90 degrees.

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:16.010
And we already know that 90
degrees is a special angle.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:17.325
This is a right angle.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.810
There's also a word for
two angles whose sum add up

00:02:26.810 --> 00:02:30.860
to 90 degrees, and
that is complementary.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:38.900
So we can also say that
angles DBA and angles

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:40.900
ABC are complementary.

00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.490
And that is because their
measures add up to 90 degrees.

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:57.300
So the measure of angle DBA
plus the measure of angle ABC

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:00.410
is equal to 90 degrees.

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:03.300
They form a right angle
when you add them up.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.140
And just as another
point of terminology

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:09.710
that's kind of related
to right angles,

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.550
when a right angle is
formed, the two rays

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.936
that form the right angle
or the two lines that

00:03:14.936 --> 00:03:17.060
form that right angle or
the two line segments that

00:03:17.060 --> 00:03:19.570
form that right angle
are called perpendicular.

00:03:19.570 --> 00:03:23.420
So because we know that measure
of angle DBC is 90 degrees

00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.600
or that angle DBC is a
right angle, this tells us,

00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:36.130
we know that the
line segment DB is

00:03:36.130 --> 00:03:46.650
perpendicular to
line segment BC.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:53.790
Or we could even say ray BD
is-- instead of using the word

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:55.822
perpendicular, there's
sometimes this symbol

00:03:55.822 --> 00:03:58.030
right here, which really
just shows two perpendicular

00:03:58.030 --> 00:04:02.890
lines-- perpendicular to BC.

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.040
So all of these are
true statements here.

00:04:06.040 --> 00:04:08.000
And these come out of
the fact that the angle

00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:14.320
formed between DB and BC,
that is a 90-degree angle.

00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:17.970
Now, we have other words
when our two angles add up

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.110
to other things.

00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.740
So let's say, for example,
I have one angle over here.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.780
Let me put some letters
here so we can specify it.

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:37.470
So let's say this
is X, Y, and Z.

00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.470
And let's say that the
measure of angle XYZ

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:45.250
is equal to 60 degrees.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:48.920
And let's say that you
have another angle that

00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:49.650
looks like this.

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.824
And I'll call this,
let's say, maybe MNO.

00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.330
And let's say that the measure
of angle MNO is 120 degrees.

00:05:07.330 --> 00:05:10.160
So if you were to add the two
measures of these-- so let

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.280
me write this down.

00:05:11.280 --> 00:05:25.770
The measure of angle MNO plus
the measure of angle XYZ,

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.430
this is going to be equal to 120
degrees plus 60 degrees, which

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.930
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:05:32.930 --> 00:05:35.110
So if you add these
two things up,

00:05:35.110 --> 00:05:38.270
you essentially are able to go
all halfway around the circle.

00:05:38.270 --> 00:05:41.470
Or you could go throughout
the entire half circle

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.720
or semicircle for a protractor.

00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.260
And when you have two angles
that add up to 180 degrees,

00:05:47.260 --> 00:05:49.250
we call them supplementary.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.450
I know it's a little hard
to remember sometimes.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:52.960
90 degrees is complementary.

00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:54.670
They're just
complementing each other.

00:05:54.670 --> 00:05:56.750
And then if you add
up to 180 degrees,

00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.690
you have supplementary.

00:05:58.690 --> 00:06:00.315
You have supplementary angles.

00:06:03.630 --> 00:06:05.700
And if you have two
supplementary angles that

00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.850
are adjacent so that they
share a common side-- so let

00:06:08.850 --> 00:06:10.990
me draw that over here.

00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:13.760
So let's say you have one
angle that looks like this.

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:15.620
And that you have another angle.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:18.290
So let me put some
letters here again.

00:06:18.290 --> 00:06:19.890
And I'll start reusing letters.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:21.500
So let's say that this is ABC.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.820
And you have another angle
that looks like this.

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:36.570
I already used C.

00:06:36.570 --> 00:06:39.820
Once again, let's say
that this is 50 degrees.

00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:42.950
And let's say that this right
over here is 130 degrees.

00:06:42.950 --> 00:06:49.120
Clearly, angle DBA plus angle
ABC, if you add them together,

00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.560
you get 130 degrees plus 50
degrees, which is 180 degrees.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:53.930
So they are supplementary.

00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.320
So let me write that down.

00:06:55.320 --> 00:07:04.660
Angle DBA and angle
ABC are supplementary.

00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:07.990
They add up to 180 degrees.

00:07:07.990 --> 00:07:10.675
But they are also
adjacent angles.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.050
And because they're
supplementary

00:07:16.050 --> 00:07:19.340
and they're adjacent, if you
look at the broader angle,

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:22.170
the angle used from the sides
that they don't have in common.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:29.180
If you look at
angle DBC, this is

00:07:29.180 --> 00:07:31.330
going to be essentially
a straight line, which

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:37.560
we can call a straight angle.

00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.490
So I introduced you to
a bunch of words here.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:41.680
And now I think we have
all of the tools we

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:45.050
need to start doing
some interesting proofs.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:50.545
And just to review here,
we talked about any angles

00:07:50.545 --> 00:07:55.160
that add up to 90 degrees are
considered to be complementary.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.830
This is adding up to 90 degrees.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:08:00.160
If they happen to be adjacent,
then the two outside sides

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.390
will form a right angle.

00:08:03.390 --> 00:08:06.370
When you have a right angle,
the two sides of a right angle

00:08:06.370 --> 00:08:09.470
are considered to
be perpendicular.

00:08:09.470 --> 00:08:12.760
And then if you have two angles
that add up to 180 degrees,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:14.770
they're considered
supplementary.

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.690
And then if they
happen to be adjacent,

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:18.680
they will form a straight angle.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:21.440
Or another way, if you said,
if you have a straight angle

00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:24.910
and you have one of the
angles, the other angle

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:26.540
is going to be
supplementary to it.

00:08:26.540 --> 00:08:28.710
They're going to add
up to 180 degrees.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:30.710
So I'll leave you there.
