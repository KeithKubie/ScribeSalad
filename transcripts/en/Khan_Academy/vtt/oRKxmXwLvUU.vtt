00:00:00.527 --> 00:00:02.860
Now that we know a little bit
about vectors and scalars,

00:00:02.860 --> 00:00:06.365
let's try to apply what we
know about them for some pretty

00:00:06.365 --> 00:00:08.490
common problems you'd, one,
see in a physics class,

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:10.720
but they're also common problems
you'd see in everyday life,

00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:12.900
because you're trying to
figure out how far you've gone,

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:14.660
or how fast you're
going, or how long it

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.190
might take you to
get some place.

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.320
So first I have, if
Shantanu was able to travel

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:25.540
5 kilometers north in
1 hour in his car, what

00:00:25.540 --> 00:00:28.207
was his average velocity?

00:00:28.207 --> 00:00:29.790
So one, let's just
review a little bit

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:32.240
about what we know about
vectors and scalars.

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:35.350
So they're giving us that
he was able to travel

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.860
5 kilometers to the north.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:42.250
So they gave us a magnitude,
that's the 5 kilometers.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:45.530
That's the size of
how far he moved.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.340
And they also give a direction.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.410
So he moved a distance
of 5 kilometers.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.980
Distance is the scalar.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:55.710
But if you give the direction
too, you get the displacement.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.390
So this right here
is a vector quantity.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:01.100
He was displaced 5
kilometers to the north.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:03.350
And he did it in
1 hour in his car.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:06.050
What was his average velocity?

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:08.430
So velocity, and
there's many ways

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:11.060
that you might see it defined,
but velocity, once again,

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:12.690
is a vector quantity.

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:15.230
And the way that we
differentiate between vector

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.310
and scalar quantities
is we put little arrows

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:19.080
on top of vector quantities.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:21.557
Normally they are bolded,
if you can have a typeface,

00:01:21.557 --> 00:01:23.140
and they have an
arrow on top of them.

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.681
But this tells you
that not only do I

00:01:24.681 --> 00:01:26.760
care about the
value of this thing,

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.560
or I care about the
size of this thing,

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:30.014
I also care about its direction.

00:01:30.014 --> 00:01:30.930
That's what the arrow.

00:01:30.930 --> 00:01:32.680
The arrow isn't
necessarily its direction,

00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:35.870
it just tells you that
it is a vector quantity.

00:01:35.870 --> 00:01:41.670
So the velocity of something
is its change in position,

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:44.440
including the direction
of its change in position.

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.220
So you could say
its displacement,

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.910
and the letter for
displacement is

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:54.050
S. And that is a
vector quantity,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:55.850
so that is displacement.

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:58.040
And you might be
wondering, why don't they

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:00.850
use D for displacement?

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:04.050
That seems like a much
more natural first letter.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.980
And my best sense of that is,
once you start doing calculus,

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:10.039
you start using D for
something very different.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:11.680
You use it for the
derivative operator,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:14.140
and that's so that the
D's don't get confused.

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.460
And that's why we use
S for displacement.

00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:18.810
If someone has a better
explanation of that,

00:02:18.810 --> 00:02:21.920
feel free to comment
on this video,

00:02:21.920 --> 00:02:24.330
and then I'll add another
video explaining that better

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:25.670
explanation.

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:29.375
So velocity is your
displacement over time.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:36.040
If I wanted to write an
analogous thing for the scalar

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.650
quantities, I could
write that speed,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.250
and I'll write
out the word so we

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:43.150
don't get confused
with displacement.

00:02:43.150 --> 00:02:44.730
Or maybe I'll write "rate."

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:48.202
Rate is another way that
sometimes people write speed.

00:02:48.202 --> 00:02:50.660
So this is the vector version,
if you care about direction.

00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:52.170
If you don't care
about direction,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.240
you would have your rate.

00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.730
So this is rate, or speed,
is equal to the distance

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:06.370
that you travel over some time.

00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:08.910
So these two, you could
call them formulas, or you

00:03:08.910 --> 00:03:10.560
could call them
definitions, although I

00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.850
would think that they're
pretty intuitive for you.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.830
How fast something is
going, you say, how far

00:03:14.830 --> 00:03:16.937
did it go over some
period of time.

00:03:16.937 --> 00:03:18.770
These are essentially
saying the same thing.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:20.552
This is when you
care about direction,

00:03:20.552 --> 00:03:22.260
so you're dealing with
vector quantities.

00:03:22.260 --> 00:03:25.342
This is where you're not so
conscientious about direction.

00:03:25.342 --> 00:03:27.050
And so you use distance,
which is scalar,

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:28.940
and you use rate or
speed, which is scalar.

00:03:28.940 --> 00:03:31.834
Here you use displacement,
and you use velocity.

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.750
Now with that out of the
way, let's figure out

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:36.080
what his average velocity was.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:39.040
And this key word,
average, is interesting.

00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:41.670
Because it's possible that
his velocity was changing

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.500
over that whole time period.

00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.147
But for the sake of
simplicity, we're

00:03:45.147 --> 00:03:47.480
going to assume that it was
kind of a constant velocity.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.470
What we are calculating is going
to be his average velocity.

00:03:50.470 --> 00:03:52.053
But don't worry about
it, you can just

00:03:52.053 --> 00:03:54.930
assume that it wasn't changing
over that time period.

00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:59.250
So his velocity is,
his displacement

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:08.590
was 5 kilometers to the north--
I'll write just a big capital.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:12.680
Well, let me just write it
out, 5 kilometers north--

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.699
over the amount of
time it took him.

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:17.740
And let me make it clear.

00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:18.870
This is change in time.

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.250
This is also a change in time.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:27.290
Sometimes you'll just
see a t written there.

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:29.660
Sometimes you'll see
someone actually put

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:32.360
this little triangle,
the character delta,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.200
in front of it, which
explicitly means "change in."

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.030
It looks like a very fancy
mathematics when you see that,

00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:39.750
but a triangle in
front of something

00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:43.170
literally means "change in."

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.950
So this is change in time.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:48.240
So he goes 5 kilometers
north, and it took him 1 hour.

00:04:48.240 --> 00:04:51.130
So the change in
time was 1 hour.

00:04:51.130 --> 00:04:53.250
So let me write that over here.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.080
So over 1 hour.

00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:58.050
So this is equal
to, if you just look

00:04:58.050 --> 00:05:01.290
at the numerical
part of it, it is

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:07.910
5/1-- let me just write
it out, 5/1-- kilometers,

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:09.820
and you can treat the
units the same way

00:05:09.820 --> 00:05:11.700
you would treat the
quantities in a fraction.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:22.390
5/1 kilometers per hour,
and then to the north.

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:27.530
Or you could say this
is the same thing

00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:30.456
as 5 kilometers per hour north.

00:05:30.456 --> 00:05:39.590
So this is 5 kilometers
per hour to the north.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.164
So that's his average velocity,
5 kilometers per hour.

00:05:47.164 --> 00:05:49.580
And you have to be careful,
you have to say "to the north"

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.766
if you want velocity.

00:05:50.766 --> 00:05:52.640
If someone just said "5
kilometers per hour,"

00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:56.270
they're giving you a speed,
or rate, or a scalar quantity.

00:05:56.270 --> 00:05:59.839
You have to give the direction
for it to be a vector quantity.

00:05:59.839 --> 00:06:01.880
You could do the same
thing if someone just said,

00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:05.180
what was his average
speed over that time?

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:08.350
You could have said, well, his
average speed, or his rate,

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:10.520
would be the
distance he travels.

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:13.310
The distance, we don't care
about the direction now,

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:17.270
is 5 kilometers, and
he does it in 1 hour.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.180
His change in time is 1 hour.

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:28.120
So this is the same thing
as 5 kilometers per hour.

00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:31.110
So once again, we're only
giving the magnitude here.

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.720
This is a scalar quantity.

00:06:32.720 --> 00:06:36.100
If you want the vector, you
have to do the north as well.

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:38.830
Now, you might be saying,
hey, in the previous video,

00:06:38.830 --> 00:06:41.370
we talked about things in
terms of meters per second.

00:06:41.370 --> 00:06:44.220
Here, I give you kilometers,
or "kil-om-eters,"

00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:45.980
depending on how you
want to pronounce it,

00:06:45.980 --> 00:06:47.462
kilometers per hour.

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:49.420
What if someone wanted
it in meters per second,

00:06:49.420 --> 00:06:52.120
or what if I just wanted to
understand how many meters he

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.690
travels in a second?

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.260
And there, it just becomes
a unit conversion problem.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.320
And I figure it doesn't hurt
to work on that right now.

00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.360
So if we wanted to do
this to meters per second,

00:07:01.360 --> 00:07:02.850
how would we do it?

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:05.590
Well, the first step is to
think about how many meters we

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:07.330
are traveling in an hour.

00:07:07.330 --> 00:07:09.900
So let's take that 5
kilometers per hour,

00:07:09.900 --> 00:07:14.490
and we want to
convert it to meters.

00:07:14.490 --> 00:07:16.880
So I put meters
in the numerator,

00:07:16.880 --> 00:07:18.680
and I put kilometers
in the denominator.

00:07:18.680 --> 00:07:20.500
And the reason why I do that
is because the kilometers

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:22.333
are going to cancel out
with the kilometers.

00:07:22.333 --> 00:07:25.020
And how many meters are
there per kilometer?

00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:28.915
Well, there's 1,000 meters
for every 1 kilometer.

00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:35.990
And I set this up right here so
that the kilometers cancel out.

00:07:35.990 --> 00:07:37.870
So these two
characters cancel out.

00:07:37.870 --> 00:07:47.200
And if you multiply,
you get 5,000.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.460
So you have 5 times 1,000.

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:54.340
So let me write this-- I'll do
it in the same color-- 5 times

00:07:54.340 --> 00:07:55.205
1,000.

00:07:55.205 --> 00:07:56.580
So I just multiplied
the numbers.

00:07:56.580 --> 00:07:59.340
When you multiply something,
you can switch around the order.

00:07:59.340 --> 00:08:01.200
Multiplication is
commutative-- I always

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:03.470
have trouble pronouncing
that-- and associative.

00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:06.930
And then in the units, in the
numerator, you have meters,

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.800
and in the denominator,
you have hours.

00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.680
Meters per hour.

00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:23.010
And so this is equal to
5,000 meters per hour.

00:08:23.010 --> 00:08:25.300
And you might say,
hey, Sal, I know

00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.220
that 5 kilometers is the
same thing as 5,000 meters.

00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.880
I could do that in my head.

00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.320
And you probably could.

00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.780
But this canceling out
dimensions, or what's

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.770
often called
dimensional analysis,

00:08:35.770 --> 00:08:38.030
can get useful once you
start doing really, really

00:08:38.030 --> 00:08:41.039
complicated things with less
intuitive units than something

00:08:41.039 --> 00:08:41.720
like this.

00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:44.960
But you should always do an
intuitive gut check right here.

00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.180
You know that if you do
5 kilometers in an hour,

00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:48.800
that's a ton of meters.

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.830
So you should get
a larger number

00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:52.910
if you're talking
about meters per hour.

00:08:52.910 --> 00:08:54.770
And now when we want
to go to seconds,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.530
let's do an intuitive gut check.

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:59.540
If something is traveling a
certain amount in an hour,

00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.390
it should travel a much
smaller amount in a second,

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:06.450
or 1/3,600 of an hour, because
that's how many seconds there

00:09:06.450 --> 00:09:08.469
are in an hour.

00:09:08.469 --> 00:09:09.510
So that's your gut check.

00:09:09.510 --> 00:09:11.176
We should get a smaller
number than this

00:09:11.176 --> 00:09:13.130
when we want to say
meters per second.

00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:16.020
But let's actually do it with
the dimensional analysis.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:17.830
So we want to cancel
out the hours,

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:20.460
and we want to be left with
seconds in the denominator.

00:09:20.460 --> 00:09:22.790
So the best way to cancel
this hours in the denominator

00:09:22.790 --> 00:09:27.640
is by having hours
in the numerator.

00:09:27.640 --> 00:09:31.810
So you have hours per second.

00:09:31.810 --> 00:09:34.380
So how many hours
are there per second?

00:09:34.380 --> 00:09:36.260
Or another way to
think about it, 1 hour,

00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:39.670
think about the larger unit,
1 hour is how many seconds?

00:09:39.670 --> 00:09:47.100
Well, you have 60 seconds
per minute times 60 minutes

00:09:47.100 --> 00:09:51.730
per hour.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:56.090
The minutes cancel out.

00:09:56.090 --> 00:10:00.510
60 times 60 is 3,600
seconds per hour.

00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:09.310
So you could say this is 3,600
seconds for every 1 hour,

00:10:09.310 --> 00:10:16.307
or if you flip them, you would
get 1/3,600 hour per second,

00:10:16.307 --> 00:10:18.640
or hours per second, depending
on how you want to do it.

00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:25.130
So 1 hour is the same
thing as 3,600 seconds.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:28.000
And so now this hour
cancels out with that hour,

00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.870
and then you multiply,
or appropriately divide,

00:10:30.870 --> 00:10:32.390
the numbers right here.

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:43.800
And you get this is equal
to 5,000 over 3,600 meters

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:47.380
per-- all you have left in the
denominator here is second.

00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:50.590
Meters per second.

00:10:50.590 --> 00:10:53.930
And if we divide both the
numerator and the denominator--

00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.220
I could do this by hand, but
just because this video's

00:10:56.220 --> 00:10:57.750
already getting a
little bit long,

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:00.990
let me get my trusty
calculator out.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:05.470
I get my trusty calculator
out just for the sake of time.

00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:09.280
5,000 divided by 3,600, which
would be really the same thing

00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:13.410
as 50 divided by
36, that is 1.3--

00:11:13.410 --> 00:11:17.300
I'll just round it
over here-- 1.39.

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:33.440
So this is equal to
1.39 meters per second.

00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.459
So Shantanu was traveling
quite slow in his car.

00:11:35.459 --> 00:11:37.250
Well, we knew that just
by looking at this.

00:11:37.250 --> 00:11:39.570
5 kilometers per hour, that's
pretty much just letting

00:11:39.570 --> 00:11:44.480
the car roll pretty slowly.
