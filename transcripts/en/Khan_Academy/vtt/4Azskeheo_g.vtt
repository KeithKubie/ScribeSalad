00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:04.510
We've talked a good bit about
how the Chinese government is

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.560
printing yuan to buy a
foreign exchange to keep

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:09.932
the yuan devalued.

00:00:09.932 --> 00:00:11.390
But what I want to
do in this video

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:13.098
is actually look at
the data and show you

00:00:13.098 --> 00:00:15.160
that I wasn't making
all of that stuff up.

00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.520
So this is actually data from
the People's Bank of China.

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.800
This is directly
from their website.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.680
And right over here, this
is the 2010 money supply.

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.420
This is the 2009 money supply.

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:30.160
You can get any money supply,
any year that you want,

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:31.310
from their site.

00:00:31.310 --> 00:00:33.890
And what we could do is just
look at what happened over just

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:37.700
even 2010, or from a
same point in '09 to '10.

00:00:37.700 --> 00:00:41.240
Let me take November '09 to
November '10, and I'll look

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:43.790
at their M1 money supply.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.652
I'll look at their
M1 money supply.

00:00:47.652 --> 00:00:49.110
I'm going from
November to November

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:51.620
because we'll see some
of the other charts,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.960
we actually have data for there.

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:54.376
We don't have
December to December

00:00:54.376 --> 00:00:56.930
for some of the other charts
I'm going to use in this video.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.490
But it just gives
the general idea.

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:04.170
If you go from November of 2009,
the M1 money supply, now this

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:06.320
is in hundred million yuan.

00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.509
So there was a 212,493
hundred million yuan.

00:01:10.509 --> 00:01:12.300
And we'll try to convert
these into numbers

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:13.880
that make a little
bit more sense.

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.530
And then you fast forward
to November of 2010, the M1

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:22.839
is 259,420 hundred million yuan.

00:01:22.839 --> 00:01:24.380
So if we-- let's
get a calculator out

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.730
and actually make
some sense of that.

00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:34.310
So a year later, it's
at 259,420 and from that

00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:41.110
let's subtract what it
was before, 212,493.

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.170
So the difference is 46,927.

00:01:44.170 --> 00:01:46.390
Now this is in
hundred million yuan.

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:48.480
So if you wanted
it in million yuan,

00:01:48.480 --> 00:01:49.702
you want to multiply by 100.

00:01:49.702 --> 00:01:51.660
I think it's pronounced
"you-wen" or "you-won."

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:53.845
I'm not a Chinese
pronunciation expert.

00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:59.990
This is in millions of yuan.

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.470
And now if we wanted
it in billions

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:03.770
we can divide this by 1,000.

00:02:03.770 --> 00:02:06.080
So let's divide this by 1,000.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.020
So it's roughly
4.6, 4.7 trillion

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:13.080
yuan increase in
their M1 money supply

00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.530
from November, 2009
to November, 2010.

00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.350
Sort of a pretty
dramatic increase.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:21.560
And just so you could put
this in the scope of dollars

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.530
I'll use a rough approximation
for the current exchange

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:27.480
rate, 6.5 yuan per dollar.

00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:30.680
So let me just
divide that by 6.5

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:33.900
to get a rough approximation for
what that would be in dollars.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:36.890
And we get $721-- remember
this was in billions-- so we're

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.070
actually $722 billion expansion
in the M1 money supply of China

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:47.279
from November, 2009
to November, 2010.

00:02:47.279 --> 00:02:48.820
In the next video,
we're going to see

00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.250
how this compares to the actual
increase in foreign exchange,

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:54.827
or actually foreign assets.

00:02:54.827 --> 00:02:56.660
And we can see how much
of this was actually

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.122
just to go and go buy
things from other countries,

00:02:59.122 --> 00:03:01.330
or buy foreign exchange from
other current countries,

00:03:01.330 --> 00:03:06.380
and essentially to keep
the Chinese yuan devalued.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:10.808

the Khan Academy for CNBC.
