If you haven't seen the Hallelujah Flash Mob
yet, you've missed out. After one month, the

00:00:04.479 --> 00:00:11.479
video already has 26 million views. One girl
starts singing, people get confused, a guy

00:00:12.740 --> 00:00:19.740
joins in, and then BOOM, a host of secret
flash mob agents join in, and they handle

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:23.289
it pretty well.

00:00:23.289 --> 00:00:27.949
But is the Hallelujah Flash Mob the best flash
mob of all time?

00:00:27.949 --> 00:00:33.540
From Michael Jackson to Latvian Folk dancing,
all aboard the BOAT.

00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.180
First up, my favorite. Improv Everywhere had
80 people dressed in blue shirts and khakis

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:44.600
walk into Best Buy. The store's employees
got so scared...yeah...they called the police.

00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:49.760
Improv everywhere is also famous for Frozen
Grand Central, where 200 people just plain-old

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.780
stopped moving. They started moving eventually,
but if you'd rather split the difference,

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:59.240
the same group also has 225 people move in
slow motion at Home Depot.

00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.010
Impressive, right?

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:06.960
Well, here are 3,000 people freezing in Paris.
T-Mobile was behind this flash mob, one of

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.070
the best recorded and documented ever.

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:15.680
But who cares about cool angles and editing
when you can have a Lightsaber flash mob

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.930
instead?

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:23.520
This happened in Poland. Not much is going
on until a stand-off ensues, a finger-gun

00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:28.100
is pulled, everyone freaks out and starts
shooting, and people drop like flies.

00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:29.440
Not enough skin for you?

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.390
Well, here's an effort from Flip. It might
be all "over when the fat lady sings," but

00:01:34.390 --> 00:01:41.090
it all starts when the fat boy in a Speedo
dances.

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.159
If you wish these people would stop being
so vertical, I guess this Swedish dance troupe's

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:50.260
flash mob is more your style...A bunch of
people fall over Domino-style and then boogie

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.280
while lying on their backs.

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:56.670
Subtract the dancing and add a crazy guy with
a giant hammer and you've got this human Domino

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:57.549
chain.

00:01:57.549 --> 00:02:02.659
But now, here's a bus driver in Europe whose
transport company surprised him with a birthday

00:02:02.659 --> 00:02:08.220
flash mob. At first, a lone trumpeter makes
him go "Whaaa?" But then a woman starts singing

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:14.760
to him, more people join in, and once he starts
to get it, he drives right into a surprise

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.680
Bday party for himself.

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.290
I leave you today with some romance.

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:21.370
This guy organized an entire flash mob in
New York, so that when he proposed and she

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:25.920
said "yes," everyone would clap and then join
in with the dance explosion celebration.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:32.730
So, there you go. What's the best flash mob
of all time? Let me know what you think below,

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:36.760
and if you have an idea for a future flash
mob that you think would be even better, let

00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:39.410
me know what it would be, how it would work,
and why it would rule.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:46.410
And, as always guys, thanks for watching.
