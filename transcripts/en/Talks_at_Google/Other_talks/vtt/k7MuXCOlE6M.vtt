[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:13.494 --> 00:00:15.910
MICHAEL HARTL: Good afternoon,
and welcome to Google's Los

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:19.300
Angeles office in beautiful
Venice, California.

00:00:19.300 --> 00:00:22.880
Happy Tau Day, everyone.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:24.790
I'm Michael Hartl,
founder of Tau Day,

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:28.960
and author of "The
Tau Manifesto."

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:31.960
Today's talk is about
the circle constant.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.630
That is to say the
number that relates

00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:39.330
the circumference of the
circle to its linear dimension.

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:41.590
Now I'm being intentionally
ambiguous there

00:00:41.590 --> 00:00:44.200
when I say linear dimension,
because the traditional choice

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.380
for that dimension
is the diameter,

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.236
but that's not the only
choice, as we'll see.

00:00:50.236 --> 00:00:53.230
If you make this choice, you
can characterize the geometry

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.520
of the circle by dividing the
circumference by the diameter,

00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:00.360
yielding the traditional
circle constant, pi.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.650
pi was famously approximated
by Archimedes of Syracuse.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:12.460
In modern notation, C over D is
approximately equal to 3.14159,

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.119
and so on.

00:01:15.119 --> 00:01:16.660
But there's something
fishy about pi.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.580
pi writes the
circumference divided

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.860
by the diameter,
which gives primacy

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.350
to the width of the circle.

00:01:28.350 --> 00:01:31.110
But in fact, there are
infinitely many shapes

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.990
that have constant diameter.

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:37.190
There's one shape that
has constant radius.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.810
The circle is the set of all
points a particular distance

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.210
the radius away from the center.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:44.070
And this suggests
that possibility

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:47.190
that perhaps a more natural
choice for the circle constant

00:01:47.190 --> 00:01:51.520
is C over R. Quick calculation
shows the relationship

00:01:51.520 --> 00:01:53.447
between the two, pi
is equal to C over D,

00:01:53.447 --> 00:01:57.240
which is equal to C over 2r.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:58.720
And this factor of
2, as we'll see,

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.110
haunts us throughout science,
engineering, and mathematics.

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:07.520
Multiply 2 by 0.2 and you get
that T over r is equal to 2 pi.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.190
If you look back at the original
approximation by Archimedes,

00:02:10.190 --> 00:02:14.020
he actually calculated, or
bounds for both C over D and C

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:15.760
over r.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:21.370
In modern notation, C over
r is 6.28285 and so on.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:26.470
So in 2010, I proposed
a notation for T over r.

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:29.710
I proposed using the
Greek letter tau.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:31.910
And this was in an
effort to popularize

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.820
what I believe is the true
circle constant in opposition

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.120
to pi.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:40.010
So at this point, I would like
to acknowledge that we are up

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.706
against a powerful enemy.

00:02:43.706 --> 00:02:45.830
All of us have been exposed
to an enormous lifetime

00:02:45.830 --> 00:02:48.050
dose of pro pi propaganda.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:50.420
I mean, people write
books about pi.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.790
There are whole books about pi.

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:57.590
I mean, people write
books about pi.

00:02:57.590 --> 00:03:00.080
A few years ago, a
little internet startup

00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:02.420
called Google even
changed their logo

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:05.540
in honor of so-called
Pi Day, 3.14,

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:07.910
in the American way
of writing dates.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.030
In case you're wondering,
this was the final straw,

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:14.120
was the Google Doodle
on Pi Day in 2010.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.000
I thought all right,
enough is enough.

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.090
People form a real
emotional attachment to pi.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:21.020
They connect to it.

00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:24.260
They memorize hundreds, even
thousands, of it's digits.

00:03:24.260 --> 00:03:26.450
I mean, I know it
might seem crazy,

00:03:26.450 --> 00:03:29.514
even to memorize 50
decimal places of pi.

00:03:29.514 --> 00:03:30.680
Like who would even do that?

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:38.870
3.14159265358979
3238462643383279

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:50.747
50288419716939937510.

00:03:50.747 --> 00:03:52.080
It's a terrible, terrible thing.

00:03:54.810 --> 00:03:57.660
So even though we're up
against a powerful enemy,

00:03:57.660 --> 00:04:01.000
we do have a powerful ally.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.990
Because the truth
is on our side.

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:06.070
So let's take a look at
some common expressions

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.830
in mathematics and see if
we can see any patterns.

00:04:09.830 --> 00:04:11.460
So this is the
normal distribution,

00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.530
this is the density
for a bell curve.

00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:16.644
As you can see,
there's a 2pi there.

00:04:16.644 --> 00:04:18.060
The details here
aren't important,

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:19.680
just look at the patterns.

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.180
Fourier transform, important
in many areas of science

00:04:22.180 --> 00:04:26.140
in mathematics, so 2 pie there.

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:30.720
Cauchy's integral formula in
complex analysis, it's a 2 pi.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.470
Gauss-Bonnet formula in
differential geometry,

00:04:35.470 --> 00:04:41.465
the so-called nth roots
of unity, it's a 2 pi.

00:04:41.465 --> 00:04:42.820
This is one of my favorite sums.

00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:44.320
It's the sum of the
inverse squares,

00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.690
1, plus 1/4, plus 1/9,
plus 1/16, and so on.

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:49.240
In summation notation, we can
write that as the sum as n

00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:51.760
goes from n to infinity
of 1 over n squared.

00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:53.500
This actually has a
closed form solution.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:54.916
Anyone happen to know it?

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:56.620
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:04:56.620 --> 00:04:58.800
MICHAEL HARTL: Yeah, this
is pi squared over 6.

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.600
So that's a pi, right?

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:03.724
Well, it turns out that this
is true for the second power.

00:05:03.724 --> 00:05:05.140
It tested true for
a fourth power.

00:05:05.140 --> 00:05:07.917
There's a closed form solution,
pi to the fourth over 90,

00:05:07.917 --> 00:05:09.750
which might be that you
suspect that anytime

00:05:09.750 --> 00:05:12.150
there's an even exponent there
that there is a closed form

00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:12.510
solution.

00:05:12.510 --> 00:05:13.176
And that's true.

00:05:13.176 --> 00:05:15.810
It can be written in terms
of the Riemann zeta function.

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:16.860
Again, don't worry
about the details.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:18.276
I just like to
draw your attention

00:05:18.276 --> 00:05:21.230
to this factor of 2pi.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:24.006
So even in this case, where it
seems like pi's just by itself,

00:05:24.006 --> 00:05:25.630
in fact, there's a
missing factor of 2.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:31.350
So I'd like to explain some of
the origins of this project,

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.210
and it begins with a
mathematician named Bob Poulle.

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:39.030
In 2001, Bob Poulle published
an article called "Pi is Wrong"

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.780
in "The Mathematical
Intelligencer."

00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.670
Now of course, he didn't mean
that pi is literally wrong.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.850
It still has all the qualities
and characteristics ascribed

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:49.020
to it by mathematicians.

00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:52.860
It's irrational, and
indeed, transcendental.

00:05:52.860 --> 00:05:55.020
But the point of
"Pi is Wrong" is

00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:57.690
that pi is an unnatural choice,
because of this factor of 2

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.160
that we saw.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.680
And "Pi is Wrong"
introduces this idea of C

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:04.710
over r being one turn, because
as we'll see, it represents

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:07.090
one turn of the circle.

00:06:07.090 --> 00:06:10.060
And so, at this point, I'd
like to acknowledge that Bob is

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:11.310
actually here in the audience.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.680
He came out for this
talk, and to meet me,

00:06:13.680 --> 00:06:15.909
and other tau enthusiasts.

00:06:15.909 --> 00:06:17.700
So, if we could give
him just a brief round

00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:20.520
of applause for his work
in starting this thing.

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:27.310
So "Pi is Wrong" planted
the seed for what

00:06:27.310 --> 00:06:28.840
became "The Tau Manifesto."

00:06:28.840 --> 00:06:30.640
And I noticed that
people were citing it

00:06:30.640 --> 00:06:33.760
on places like Reddit and
Hacker News, the kinds of places

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:37.031
that computer, math, and science
geeks hang out on the internet.

00:06:37.031 --> 00:06:38.530
But it wasn't really
going anywhere.

00:06:38.530 --> 00:06:40.300
It hadn't turned into anything.

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.220
It hadn't turned
into a movement.

00:06:42.220 --> 00:06:46.060
So in 2010, I set out
to hack geek culture.

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:49.450
I thought I'm going to introduce
this notation, something that's

00:06:49.450 --> 00:06:52.270
immediately pronounceable,
that's easy to typeset,

00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:54.780
and it has kind of a
visual resemblance to pi.

00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:56.380
It looks like pi,
but missing a leg.

00:06:59.020 --> 00:07:01.930
It was also influenced
by the choice

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:04.860
of describing this as a turn.

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.880
The English word turn is
based on the Greek word

00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.963
tornos, which means lathe.

00:07:07.963 --> 00:07:10.130
And you can see
there is a factor,

00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:13.930
there's a tau right there at
the beginning of the word.

00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:18.130
So armed with this
idea, this new notation,

00:07:18.130 --> 00:07:21.700
tau equals 2pi numerically,
I realized that we also

00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.400
needed a focus for the
movement, something that

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.790
would bring everyone together.

00:07:25.790 --> 00:07:27.850
And so it's amazing
how long it took

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.070
me to figure out the
answer that was obviously

00:07:30.070 --> 00:07:33.400
correct, in retrospect, which
was to take pi Day, which

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:38.470
happens on 3:14, and
launch a new holiday,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.170
called Tau Day, on June 28.

00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:46.630
So on June 28, 2010, I launched
the original Tau Manifesto.

00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:48.880
And it immediately
struck a chord.

00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:51.250
So I took some
screenshots that day.

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:53.410
Someone tweeted
out, hooray for tau.

00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:57.280
This breathes new life
into my trigonometry.

00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.160
That sound, it's
my mind blowing.

00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:02.260
Childhood suspicions confirmed.

00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:03.940
The circle constant is broken.

00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.170
Switching to tau immediately.

00:08:07.170 --> 00:08:08.590
This guy really get into it.

00:08:08.590 --> 00:08:11.710
Do not circles deserve first
class quadratic recognition?

00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:16.220
Let us throw off the yoke
of ignorant pi oppression.

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:18.220
So I knew I was onto
something when the next day

00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.530
I got a bunch of
messages like this.

00:08:20.530 --> 00:08:24.160
Oh, no, I missed Tau Day.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.780
So over the course
of the next year,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:28.040
other people picked
it up and ran with it.

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:29.930
And so at that
point, I really knew

00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.419
that something was going on.

00:08:32.419 --> 00:08:34.660
So Michael Blake
composed an amazing piece

00:08:34.660 --> 00:08:35.909
called "What Tau Sounds Like."

00:08:35.909 --> 00:08:37.159
I had nothing to do with that.

00:08:37.159 --> 00:08:38.379
He just did that on his own.

00:08:38.379 --> 00:08:43.120
It's got over 600,000
views as of now on YouTube.

00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:47.390
On the first pi Day, after the
launch of "The Tau Manifesto,"

00:08:47.390 --> 00:08:49.630
the amazing Vi Hart
released a video.

00:08:49.630 --> 00:08:52.670
If you haven't seen her videos,
they're just incredible.

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:55.060
She made a video called
"Pi is Still Wrong."

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:57.040
And it's got over 2
and 1/2 million views

00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:00.730
on YouTube as of right now.

00:09:00.730 --> 00:09:03.760
Of course, I don't really
these days call it pi Day.

00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.295
I call it Half Tau Day.

00:09:05.295 --> 00:09:06.480
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:08.180
So this started to take off.

00:09:08.180 --> 00:09:09.910
And it started to
infiltrate geek culture

00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:11.230
in the way I hoped it might.

00:09:11.230 --> 00:09:13.690
So, for example, MIT
changed the time of day

00:09:13.690 --> 00:09:14.860
they announced admissions.

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:16.120
It used to be just on pi Day.

00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:17.700
Now it's on pi Day at Tau Time.

00:09:21.190 --> 00:09:24.370
Tau made it into the
iconic geek comic strip,

00:09:24.370 --> 00:09:29.430
"xkcd," with a pi versus tau
proposed compromise to the pi

00:09:29.430 --> 00:09:29.930
tau dispute.

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:33.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:36.580
Not to be outdone, another
iconic geek comic strip,

00:09:36.580 --> 00:09:38.080
"Saturday Morning
Breakfast Cereal,"

00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:41.350
or "SNBC," made this comic.

00:09:41.350 --> 00:09:42.850
The father says,
hey, little monkey,

00:09:42.850 --> 00:09:45.820
can you tell daddy how many
fingers is this many fingers?

00:09:45.820 --> 00:09:47.220
Two finger.

00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:50.327
Later, so my two-year-old
calculated that pi tau

00:09:50.327 --> 00:09:51.160
conversion constant.

00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:54.130
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:54.130 --> 00:09:55.670
It's made it into textbooks.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:58.240
There's a college trigonometry
textbook that uses tau.

00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.210
And I've gotten lots of
feedback from teachers

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:04.500
in high school and
other levels as well,

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.200
saying that they'd use
tau with great success.

00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:11.650
It's also made it into some
computer programming languages.

00:10:11.650 --> 00:10:14.260
Most recently, a little
niche language some of you

00:10:14.260 --> 00:10:18.280
may have heard of here
at Google called Python.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:24.742
So as of Python 3.6, for math,
import tau, and there we are.

00:10:24.742 --> 00:10:26.200
I'm sure many people
here also know

00:10:26.200 --> 00:10:30.110
that there's a calculator at
Google, if you drop pi into it,

00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:33.200
it'll evaluate it as
3.14159, and so on.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:37.500
But in fact, this isn't
pi, this is tau over 2.

00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:39.370
So I want to find out
who is responsible

00:10:39.370 --> 00:10:43.120
for this and by
that person a beer.

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.580
Speaking of which,
tau has also spread

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:49.960
to areas that aren't
strictly science and math.

00:10:49.960 --> 00:10:51.790
A couple of years ago,
Hawks Head Brewery

00:10:51.790 --> 00:10:54.010
in the UK and Crooked
State collaborated

00:10:54.010 --> 00:10:57.414
on a sour beer called
Key Lime pi on each side,

00:10:57.414 --> 00:10:59.330
but they said you know,
there are two of them,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:02.390
so we should call
it the Key Lime Tau.

00:11:02.390 --> 00:11:05.980
Any guesses what the alcohol
percentage in this beer is?

00:11:05.980 --> 00:11:10.750
That's right, 6.28%.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.590
But of course, you can't
take on an icon like pi

00:11:13.590 --> 00:11:18.120
without expecting some
conflict and resistance.

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.720
So there has been some pushback
on the choice of notation,

00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:23.517
to start with that,
the Greek letter, tau.

00:11:23.517 --> 00:11:25.350
And there are some
legitimate concerns here.

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.609
I'd like to mention a
couple of important figures

00:11:28.609 --> 00:11:30.900
who have emerged since the
original "Tau Manifesto" got

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:32.010
published.

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:34.860
One is a physicist in Europe,
named Peter Harremoes.

00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.350
And he reached out to Bob
Poulle around the same time

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:39.150
that I told Bob
that I was planning

00:11:39.150 --> 00:11:41.730
to publish "The Tau
Manifesto," proposing

00:11:41.730 --> 00:11:44.090
that we use tau for C over r.

00:11:44.090 --> 00:11:46.320
He was completely
independent of me.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:50.100
And I later found out
that Joseph Lindenberg

00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:55.380
wrote a math essay in 1990 or
so on mathematical constants.

00:11:55.380 --> 00:11:57.060
And it was obvious
to him that C over r

00:11:57.060 --> 00:11:58.589
was the right circle constant.

00:11:58.589 --> 00:11:59.880
But you needed a symbol for it.

00:11:59.880 --> 00:12:01.254
So at the time,
he was restricted

00:12:01.254 --> 00:12:03.305
to the Roman alphabet
and the Greek alphabet.

00:12:03.305 --> 00:12:04.180
So we looked through.

00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.050
He thought, well, which letter
feels most like a circle

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:08.634
consonant and has--

00:12:08.634 --> 00:12:10.050
minimizes the
number of conflicts.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:11.350
Which is the least bad choice?

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:13.076
And he came up with tau as well.

00:12:13.076 --> 00:12:14.700
In fact, Joseph now
maintains a website

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.890
called Tau Before It Was Cool.

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:18.870
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:20.400
But there are real conflicts.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.410
So for example, in
rotational mechanics,

00:12:22.410 --> 00:12:24.300
tau is used for torque.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:26.852
In relativity, it's
used for proper time.

00:12:26.852 --> 00:12:29.310
I found out after I published
the manifesto, that it's also

00:12:29.310 --> 00:12:31.560
used for the golden ratio,
1 plus the square root of 5

00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:33.270
over 2.

00:12:33.270 --> 00:12:35.220
Now this is the kind
of thing that, yes,

00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:35.880
there's some conflicts.

00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.171
There are only so many letters.

00:12:37.171 --> 00:12:39.850
But it's also something
that you can write around.

00:12:39.850 --> 00:12:42.039
So for example, one of
my favorite textbooks,

00:12:42.039 --> 00:12:43.830
"Introduction to
Electrodynamics," by David

00:12:43.830 --> 00:12:46.170
Griffiths, uses n for torque.

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:49.230
Not to route around a conflict,
just that's the letter he uses.

00:12:49.230 --> 00:12:52.350
For proper time, maybe you
could throw on a subscript.

00:12:52.350 --> 00:12:54.690
The golden ratio has a
standard alternate, that's

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.720
probably even more common.

00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:58.116
You can use the letter Phi.

00:12:58.116 --> 00:12:59.490
But it's also
interesting to note

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:01.740
that the use of tau
for the golden ratio

00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.230
shows that there is precedent
for using this letter

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.950
to represent a fundamental
mathematical constant.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:09.850
So even though there
are these conflicts,

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:11.840
and you can maybe
route around them,

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.470
I think a lot of scientists,
engineers, and mathematicians

00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:17.000
underestimate their ability
to handle ambiguous notation.

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.812
So I want to show you an example
drawn from quantum mechanics.

00:13:20.812 --> 00:13:22.270
Don't worry about
the details here.

00:13:22.270 --> 00:13:24.144
You can just look at
the high level patterns.

00:13:24.144 --> 00:13:26.469
This is A0, the Bohr radius.

00:13:26.469 --> 00:13:28.510
By the way, note that
that's the Bohr radius, not

00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:31.060
the Bohr diameter.

00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:33.760
And it's a combination
or fundamental constants,

00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:35.530
H bar squared over me squared.

00:13:35.530 --> 00:13:40.010
H bar is Planck's constant
divided by 2pi, that's right.

00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:43.240
m is the math on electron
and e is its charge.

00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:45.880
Now so this represents
roughly the radius

00:13:45.880 --> 00:13:49.680
of a hydrogen atom in its ground
state, its lowest energy state.

00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:52.180
And in order to analyze this
from the perspective of quantum

00:13:52.180 --> 00:13:55.780
mechanics, you introduce
what's called the wave function

00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:56.900
sine on.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:13:59.750
And that's proportional to
e to the minus r over A0.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:02.830
And so again, this just
describes the system

00:14:02.830 --> 00:14:03.850
mathematically.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:08.220
And what this says is that
it decays exponentially

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:13.037
with a length scale
set by the Bohr radius.

00:14:13.037 --> 00:14:14.620
If you've never seen
before, you might

00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:16.080
think I don't understand
what's going on here.

00:14:16.080 --> 00:14:18.370
If you've seen this before,
you're like I get it.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.410
But there's something
you haven't noticed,

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:22.800
which is the point.

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:27.077
This e and this e
are not the same e.

00:14:27.077 --> 00:14:28.910
The first one is the
charge on the electron,

00:14:28.910 --> 00:14:31.243
and the second one is the
exponential number at the base

00:14:31.243 --> 00:14:32.660
of natural logarithms.

00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.310
In fact if you
expand out this A0,

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:38.420
you get e to something
with e in it.

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.520
I guarantee if you said,
oh, let's use for e

00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:41.650
for a mathematical
constant, people

00:14:41.650 --> 00:14:42.530
would say oh, no,
you can't do that,

00:14:42.530 --> 00:14:44.863
because it's already used for
the charge on an electron.

00:14:44.863 --> 00:14:48.680
But in practice, nobody really
has any trouble with this.

00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:51.106
So that's all I'm going
to say about the notation.

00:14:51.106 --> 00:14:52.730
The rest of the talk
is about the math.

00:14:52.730 --> 00:14:55.730
And of course, there has
been some pushback on that.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:59.235
"The pi Manifesto"
appeared in 2011.

00:14:59.235 --> 00:15:01.110
There's a full rebuttal
to "The pi Manifesto"

00:15:01.110 --> 00:15:02.990
in an updated version of
"The Tau Manifesto," which

00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:03.560
you can check out.

00:15:03.560 --> 00:15:05.143
But the rest of this
talk, we're going

00:15:05.143 --> 00:15:08.870
to discuss the
mathematics behind tau.

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.190
And in order to do that, I want
to return to first principles

00:15:13.190 --> 00:15:18.330
by taking a fresh look
at circles and angles.

00:15:18.330 --> 00:15:20.970
You may recall from
high school trigonometry

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:23.940
these special angles
are written in degrees.

00:15:23.940 --> 00:15:28.520
So zero degrees, 30
degrees, 45, 60 degrees,

00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.895
90 degrees for a right
angle, and then 120,

00:15:30.895 --> 00:15:36.140
180, 270, and then back, 360.

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:38.630
But as you may know,
degrees are in fact

00:15:38.630 --> 00:15:40.730
not the preferred way
of measuring angles

00:15:40.730 --> 00:15:41.930
in mathematics.

00:15:41.930 --> 00:15:45.832
Instead, mathematicians prefer
to use a system called radians.

00:15:45.832 --> 00:15:47.540
So in radian angle
measure what you do is

00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.730
you observe that the
ratio of the arc length,

00:15:49.730 --> 00:15:53.660
s, to the radius,
is constant for all

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.240
those concentric circles.

00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:01.040
And so you can define an angle
theta as that ratio, s over r.

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:04.880
So I'm going to show what
those special angles look like.

00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:06.970
You recognize them in degrees.

00:16:06.970 --> 00:16:07.971
We'll come back to this.

00:16:07.971 --> 00:16:09.678
But I just want to
kind of shock you back

00:16:09.678 --> 00:16:10.940
into high school trigonometry.

00:16:10.940 --> 00:16:12.481
These are the angles
written in terms

00:16:12.481 --> 00:16:16.280
of pi, what I call pi radians.

00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:18.370
If you're like me,
you memorized these

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:20.610
in high school trigonometry.

00:16:20.610 --> 00:16:23.150
But if you think about what
these angles really are,

00:16:23.150 --> 00:16:24.740
what makes them
special, they're just

00:16:24.740 --> 00:16:27.120
particularly simple
fractions of a full circle.

00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:29.090
So for example,
the 30 degree angle

00:16:29.090 --> 00:16:31.580
here is a 12th of the circle.

00:16:31.580 --> 00:16:33.260
45 degrees is an 8th.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:37.550
A right angle is just a
quarter, here's a third.

00:16:37.550 --> 00:16:40.250
And finally, all the way
around the full circle.

00:16:42.910 --> 00:16:46.090
So that suggests
writing the arc length

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.357
in terms of the fraction
of the full circumference

00:16:48.357 --> 00:16:48.940
of the circle.

00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:51.780
So for a 30 degree angle
that fraction would be 1/12.

00:16:51.780 --> 00:16:55.830
For a right angle,
it's a 1/4, and so on.

00:16:55.830 --> 00:16:59.020
So if we can plug in to the
definition of radian angle

00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:02.220
measure, we can see that
theta is equal to s over r,

00:17:02.220 --> 00:17:04.359
but s is FC.

00:17:04.359 --> 00:17:06.024
So that's FC over r.

00:17:06.024 --> 00:17:09.790
And factor out that
fraction as the fraction

00:17:09.790 --> 00:17:14.058
times this dimension
was constant, C over r.

00:17:14.058 --> 00:17:15.349
But of course, that's just tau.

00:17:19.290 --> 00:17:21.000
So if you are a
believer in pi, I

00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:23.420
fear that the resulting
diagram of special angles

00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.670
will shake your faith
to its very core.

00:17:26.670 --> 00:17:32.080
Because this 1/12 of the way
around is just tau over 12.

00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:35.880
An 1/8 is tau over 8.

00:17:35.880 --> 00:17:39.930
And so on around the rest
of the circle, finally

00:17:39.930 --> 00:17:42.185
arriving back at one
turn equals 1 tau.

00:17:48.530 --> 00:17:50.420
So to me this is just
a one diagram proof

00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:52.710
the tau is the right
circle constant.

00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.520
There's no way around it.

00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.770
And if you compare it
to the diagram with pi,

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:58.580
you can see what's
going on here.

00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:00.340
What's happening
here is, for example,

00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.970
at a right angle, that's
a 2 pi divided by 4.

00:18:03.970 --> 00:18:07.420
But that cancels, the 2's
cancel and we get pi over 2.

00:18:07.420 --> 00:18:09.340
So we have a
quarter of something

00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.140
is equal to a half of pi.

00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:13.130
And that's really confusing.

00:18:13.130 --> 00:18:15.700
Indeed I think that this
confusing factor of 2

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.860
is probably part of the
reason why degrees are still

00:18:18.860 --> 00:18:20.890
the most common way of
talking about angles,

00:18:20.890 --> 00:18:23.350
that radians have
never really taken

00:18:23.350 --> 00:18:25.370
root outside of these
narrow contexts.

00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:27.320
And I think that's probably why.

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:31.190
So I think if you look at
this series of diagrams--

00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:34.840
I'm sorry, so conversely,
if we look at this here,

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:38.910
we see that tau to 4
is just a quarter turn.

00:18:38.910 --> 00:18:42.160
It has a transparent
geometric meaning.

00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.190
But it's also just
a number, right?

00:18:44.190 --> 00:18:47.870
6.28 divided by 4, 1.57.

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:50.500
So we get all of the
concrete benefits

00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:53.470
of radians, while still having
this transparent abstract

00:18:53.470 --> 00:18:54.500
meaning.

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:56.770
So I think if you look at
this series of diagrams

00:18:56.770 --> 00:19:00.430
through eye of a
beginner, you can

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:04.521
see that using pi instead of
tau is a pedagogical disaster.

00:19:04.521 --> 00:19:06.091
It's confusing, it's unnatural.

00:19:06.091 --> 00:19:07.090
This is why pi is wrong.

00:19:10.370 --> 00:19:12.740
At this point,
more mathematically

00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:15.530
sophisticated people are
scrambling through their heads,

00:19:15.530 --> 00:19:17.000
like what are some other things.

00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.054
Like, oh, yeah, oh, yeah,
what about Euler's identity.

00:19:20.054 --> 00:19:21.470
So if you've heard
of this before,

00:19:21.470 --> 00:19:23.300
you might already
have thought of it.

00:19:23.300 --> 00:19:26.460
And if you haven't, well, you're
about to get an introduction.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:28.190
So to talk about
Euler's identity,

00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:32.640
I want to discuss
the circle functions.

00:19:32.640 --> 00:19:36.740
So let's look at what's called a
unit circle, radius equals one.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:40.370
And there's a point here on
the circle with an angle theta

00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.290
from the horizontal.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:45.440
And there's an x-coordinate
and a y-coordinate.

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:49.490
And in terms of what they
call the circle functions,

00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:50.900
this is cosine and sine.

00:19:50.900 --> 00:19:52.860
I'm sure many of you
are familiar with this.

00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.272
So that point has
x-coordinate cosine theta,

00:19:55.272 --> 00:19:56.480
and y-coordinates sine theta.

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:03.150
Now Leonhard Euler proved
an important formula,

00:20:03.150 --> 00:20:07.530
an important theorem, based on
these circle functions relating

00:20:07.530 --> 00:20:11.114
complex exponentiation
to cosine and sine.

00:20:11.114 --> 00:20:13.530
Now Euler was one of the great
mathematicians of all time.

00:20:13.530 --> 00:20:16.890
And so you can bet
that if something

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:18.686
is called Euler's
formula, it must

00:20:18.686 --> 00:20:21.060
be pretty important, because
he proved a lot of formulas.

00:20:21.060 --> 00:20:22.100
So here it is.

00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.230
e to the I theta equals cosine
theta, plus I sine theta.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:27.180
So this relates
complex exponentiation

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.460
to the circle functions.

00:20:29.460 --> 00:20:34.410
And in order to get what I
believe deserves the name

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:37.290
and what captures the true
spirit of Euler's identity,

00:20:37.290 --> 00:20:39.570
we're going to
evaluate this formula

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:43.100
when theta is equal to the
circle constant, which is tau.

00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.227
So e to the i tau equals
cosine tau, plus i sine tau.

00:20:47.227 --> 00:20:48.810
We look at our unit
circle, when theta

00:20:48.810 --> 00:20:52.645
equals tau, all the way
around, cosine theta is 1--

00:20:52.645 --> 00:20:55.680
or cosine tau here is
1 and sine tau is 0.

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.740
So that gives us this equation.

00:20:57.740 --> 00:20:59.110
e to the i tau equals 1.

00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.950
And using the idea or the
name that mathematicians

00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.440
use for 1, when they
want it think of it,

00:21:07.440 --> 00:21:10.680
not just as a number,
but as the abstract idea,

00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.110
we can say that the complex
exponential of the circle

00:21:13.110 --> 00:21:15.600
constant is unity.

00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:19.650
So the fundamental relationship
between these constants.

00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.290
And indeed, there's a
geometric interpretation.

00:21:22.290 --> 00:21:24.780
If you look in the
complex plane and have

00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:26.940
the real part of the number,
of the complex number

00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:31.320
z on the x-axis and the
imaginary part on the y-axis,

00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:34.350
and then rotate it
through an angle theta,

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:38.430
that rotated point is the
same as multiplying by e

00:21:38.430 --> 00:21:39.120
to the i theta.

00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.010
So e to the I
theta geometrically

00:21:41.010 --> 00:21:43.050
corresponds to a rotation
by an angle theta

00:21:43.050 --> 00:21:45.029
in the complex plane.

00:21:45.029 --> 00:21:47.070
So that means we can
interpret this geometrically

00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:49.781
as a rotation by one turn as 1.

00:21:49.781 --> 00:21:51.780
So in other words, if you
rotate by a full turn,

00:21:51.780 --> 00:21:53.790
you just get back to
where you started.

00:21:53.790 --> 00:21:55.456
And that's the same
thing as multiplying

00:21:55.456 --> 00:21:58.030
by 1, which does nothing.

00:21:58.030 --> 00:21:59.499
So I submit that
this is at least

00:21:59.499 --> 00:22:01.290
a candidate for the
most beautiful equation

00:22:01.290 --> 00:22:03.040
in mathematics.

00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.830
Which brings me to
what I think is not

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.130
the most beautiful equation.

00:22:08.130 --> 00:22:14.550
Which is Euler's formula
evaluated when theta equals pi.

00:22:14.550 --> 00:22:18.050
So again, looking at our circle,
when theta equals halfway

00:22:18.050 --> 00:22:24.470
around the circle, cosine pi
is negative 1, sine pi is zero,

00:22:24.470 --> 00:22:29.090
and we get e to the i
pi equals negative 1.

00:22:29.090 --> 00:22:32.150
But there's something
fishy about this formula.

00:22:32.150 --> 00:22:33.840
What's going on with
this negative sign?

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:35.270
It's so ugly.

00:22:35.270 --> 00:22:37.670
In fact, this is almost
always rearranged immediately

00:22:37.670 --> 00:22:41.600
to form e to the i
pi plus 1 equals 0.

00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:44.180
At which point, the expositor
usually says something mystical

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:47.990
like, ooh, this formula
connects the five most

00:22:47.990 --> 00:22:50.810
important numbers in
mathematics, 0, 1, i, e,

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:52.974
and pi.

00:22:52.974 --> 00:22:54.890
But is this really the
most beautiful equation

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:55.755
in mathematics?

00:22:55.755 --> 00:22:56.630
I mean, I don't know.

00:22:56.630 --> 00:22:59.150
There's a negative sign,
and we had to rearrange it.

00:22:59.150 --> 00:23:00.360
What's really going on here?

00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:04.010
Well, we can find out by
rewriting the Euler's identity

00:23:04.010 --> 00:23:06.620
traditional form
in terms of tau.

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.350
It's e to the i tau over
2 equals negative 1.

00:23:09.350 --> 00:23:10.790
No rearrangement.

00:23:10.790 --> 00:23:12.270
What's going on here?

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:15.050
Well, what's going
on here is that it's

00:23:15.050 --> 00:23:18.087
a rotation by tau over 2.

00:23:18.087 --> 00:23:20.170
So here's a point in the
complex plane, a plus ib.

00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.450
X-coordinate a, y-coordinate
b, and if we rotate it

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:30.210
around half a turn,
we get this point,

00:23:30.210 --> 00:23:34.420
at negative a, and negative b.

00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:36.390
So that's just
negative a, minus ib.

00:23:36.390 --> 00:23:40.220
We factor out the negative 1 to
get negative 1 times a plus ib.

00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:43.370
But that's just
negative 1 times z.

00:23:43.370 --> 00:23:46.100
So in other words, what
this equation is telling

00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.740
us is that a rotation by half
a turn in the complex plane

00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:51.630
is the same as
multiplying by negative 1.

00:23:51.630 --> 00:23:53.300
So the original form
of Euler's identity

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:55.040
has a transparent
geometric meaning

00:23:55.040 --> 00:23:57.700
that's obscured when we
write it in terms of pi.

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:07.042
So I believe this really ought
to be called Euler's identify.

00:24:07.042 --> 00:24:09.500
People do have a tendency to
get all numerological about it

00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:10.070
though.

00:24:10.070 --> 00:24:12.830
And it's amazing how many people
complain that this formula

00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:14.260
relates only four numbers.

00:24:14.260 --> 00:24:16.760
So in this context, I would
like to note that e to the i tau

00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:18.645
equals 1 plus 0.

00:24:22.120 --> 00:24:24.800
So I assert that this
equation actually

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:28.400
does unite all of the most--

00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:30.840
the five most important numbers
in mathematics, 0, 1, i,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:31.575
e, and tau.

00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:43.050
So if you arrived here as a
pi believer, surely by now,

00:24:43.050 --> 00:24:45.920
you must be
questioning your faith.

00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.710
Is there no iconic
famous equation

00:24:48.710 --> 00:24:50.450
that has just a pi by itself?

00:24:50.450 --> 00:24:53.130
Can anyone think of one?

00:24:53.130 --> 00:24:57.052
What's a famous equation
that just has a Pi?

00:24:57.052 --> 00:24:58.010
AUDIENCE: pi r squared.

00:24:58.010 --> 00:24:59.260
MICHAEL HARTL: pi r squared?

00:24:59.260 --> 00:25:02.450
It's true, the
area of the circle.

00:25:02.450 --> 00:25:04.855
So that is just a pi by itself.

00:25:04.855 --> 00:25:08.840
So circular area would seem to
present a challenge to the tau

00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:10.390
world view.

00:25:10.390 --> 00:25:12.490
Should I be worried?

00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:13.540
I don't feel worried.

00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:19.540
So let's take a look
at circular area

00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:20.920
and see how it's related to tau.

00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:25.755
So here's the equation,
A equals pi r squared.

00:25:25.755 --> 00:25:28.580
It's a very famous,
iconic formula.

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.130
But there's [? something ?]
fishy about this formula.

00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.440
What's fishy about it?

00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:35.966
Why the sudden love
for the radius?

00:25:35.966 --> 00:25:37.840
I thought circles were
about their diameters.

00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:40.370
We're dividing out
by D. So we really

00:25:40.370 --> 00:25:42.680
should write this, in
order to be consistent,

00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:45.811
as A equals one quarter pi D
squared, which isn't nearly as

00:25:45.811 --> 00:25:46.310
pretty.

00:25:48.292 --> 00:25:50.750
All right, so let's figure out
what's really going on here.

00:25:50.750 --> 00:25:53.360
Let's look at this expression.

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:57.290
I want to draw your attention
here to the power of 2.

00:25:57.290 --> 00:25:59.510
That second power makes
this a particularly simple

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:01.410
quadratic form.

00:26:01.410 --> 00:26:04.280
The name mathematicians use
for this kind of expression.

00:26:04.280 --> 00:26:07.070
Now I want to show
you some examples

00:26:07.070 --> 00:26:09.350
of the kind of patterns
that quadratic forms follow.

00:26:09.350 --> 00:26:11.120
And for this, I'm going
to draw on my background

00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.078
of theoretical physics.

00:26:12.078 --> 00:26:13.220
I have a PhD from Cal Tech.

00:26:13.220 --> 00:26:14.900
And when I was a
graduate student,

00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:17.596
I taught the physics core
curriculum for five years.

00:26:17.596 --> 00:26:19.970
And I'd like to show you some
examples of quadratic forms

00:26:19.970 --> 00:26:22.010
that arise in the elementary
physics curriculum.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.260
It's not necessary to
understand all the details here.

00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:27.350
Just look for the
high level patterns.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:30.740
We're going to start with a
calculation for the distance

00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:33.270
an object falls in a
particular amount of time.

00:26:33.270 --> 00:26:37.820
So Galileo Galilei found
that the velocity of a

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.290
dropped object is proportional
to the time it's fallen.

00:26:40.290 --> 00:26:44.730
So if it falls twice as
long, it goes twice as fast.

00:26:44.730 --> 00:26:46.350
The constant of
proportionality is

00:26:46.350 --> 00:26:49.950
the gravitational acceleration
G. In this context,

00:26:49.950 --> 00:26:52.200
the velocity can be defined
as the time rate of change

00:26:52.200 --> 00:26:54.230
of the height, dy dt.

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:59.700
So we can find the distance
fallen by integrating V dt.

00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.500
Which is the integral of G
dt, with G as just a constant.

00:27:02.500 --> 00:27:03.300
We can pull it out.

00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.400
The integral of t
with t squared over 2.

00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.370
So y is equal to 1/2 Gt squared.

00:27:09.974 --> 00:27:11.640
We can also look at
the potential energy

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.950
in a spring, another
common thing that

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:16.020
shows up in the elementary
physics curriculum.

00:27:16.020 --> 00:27:19.590
Robert Hooke showed that the
force that a spring exerts

00:27:19.590 --> 00:27:21.930
to restored equilibrium
is proportional

00:27:21.930 --> 00:27:24.270
to the displacement
from equilibrium.

00:27:24.270 --> 00:27:26.910
And the cause of
proportionality is essentially

00:27:26.910 --> 00:27:29.100
a measure of the
stiffness of the spring,

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:32.490
is the spring constant k.

00:27:32.490 --> 00:27:34.740
And the potential energy
is equal to the work

00:27:34.740 --> 00:27:38.020
done by the spring force, as
you compress it or stretch it.

00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:40.360
U is equal to integral of Fdx.

00:27:40.360 --> 00:27:42.640
Integrate the force
over the distance.

00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:47.865
So you say U equals Fdx, and
Fdx equals integral from zero up

00:27:47.865 --> 00:27:50.640
to the final displacement
of kx dx, which

00:27:50.640 --> 00:27:52.200
is equal to 1/2 kx squared.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.960
And finally, I want to
show you the calculation

00:27:56.960 --> 00:27:59.459
for the kinetic energy, one of
the most important quantities

00:27:59.459 --> 00:28:01.010
in mechanics.

00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:03.170
Isaac Newton found
that the force

00:28:03.170 --> 00:28:06.800
is proportional to
the acceleration.

00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:09.780
The concept proportionality
is the inertial mass n.

00:28:09.780 --> 00:28:12.500
This is the most famous
expression of Newton's Second

00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:14.912
Law of Motion, f equals na.

00:28:14.912 --> 00:28:17.120
Now the kinetic energy is
equal to the amount of work

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:21.290
done accelerating a mass m
up to a final velocity of e.

00:28:21.290 --> 00:28:23.671
So that's the integral of the
force over the displacement

00:28:23.671 --> 00:28:24.170
again.

00:28:24.170 --> 00:28:26.450
So k is equal to
interval of Fdx,

00:28:26.450 --> 00:28:29.720
but the force is mass
times acceleration.

00:28:29.720 --> 00:28:34.282
Acceleration is the time rate
of change of velocity, n Dvt.

00:28:34.282 --> 00:28:35.990
Now Newton would be
unhappy at this point

00:28:35.990 --> 00:28:39.070
because we are using the
notation of his hated rival,

00:28:39.070 --> 00:28:40.544
Gottfried Wilhelm von Leibniz.

00:28:40.544 --> 00:28:42.710
But one of the great things
about Leibniz's notation

00:28:42.710 --> 00:28:45.376
is that you can manipulate these
little differentials, these Ds,

00:28:45.376 --> 00:28:46.890
as if they were fractions.

00:28:46.890 --> 00:28:52.820
So we can write Dv
Dt Dx as m Dx Dt Dv.

00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.560
We can just swap
the Dx and the Dv.

00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.850
But this here is
just the velocity.

00:28:56.850 --> 00:28:58.610
So this is the
integral from zero up

00:28:58.610 --> 00:29:04.070
to the final velocity of
m Dv, or 1/2 m Dv squared.

00:29:04.070 --> 00:29:08.730
So just to review, distance
fallen, potential energy

00:29:08.730 --> 00:29:12.581
in the spring, kinetic energy.

00:29:12.581 --> 00:29:14.830
You may by now have a sense
of foreboding as we return

00:29:14.830 --> 00:29:18.170
to the geometry of the circle.

00:29:18.170 --> 00:29:21.070
Let's calculate the
area of a circular disk.

00:29:21.070 --> 00:29:25.390
We can do that by breaking
the disk into rings of length

00:29:25.390 --> 00:29:28.870
equal to the circumference of
that radius and thickness equal

00:29:28.870 --> 00:29:31.570
to Dr. So the area
is circumference

00:29:31.570 --> 00:29:35.910
times the thickness
of that ring.

00:29:35.910 --> 00:29:39.330
Now the circumference is
proportional to the radius.

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:42.200
Constant proportionality is tau.

00:29:42.200 --> 00:29:44.220
You can calculate the
area of the circle

00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.500
by integrating
over all the rings.

00:29:46.500 --> 00:29:51.300
So a is equal to integral Da,
equals the integral of CDr,

00:29:51.300 --> 00:29:54.210
which is the integral from zero
up to the final radius of tau

00:29:54.210 --> 00:29:57.507
rDr, which is 1/2 tau r squared.

00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:05.400
Indeed, in the original proof
by Archimedes of Syracuse,

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:07.679
he showed not that the
area was pi r squared.

00:30:07.679 --> 00:30:09.720
Archimedes didn't have
modern algebraic notation.

00:30:09.720 --> 00:30:12.630
What Archimedes proved was
that the area of a circle

00:30:12.630 --> 00:30:15.390
is the same as the area of
a right triangle with height

00:30:15.390 --> 00:30:19.020
equal to the radius, and base
equal to the circumference.

00:30:19.020 --> 00:30:21.660
We can then apply the formula
for the area of a triangle,

00:30:21.660 --> 00:30:24.180
area equals 1/2
base times height,

00:30:24.180 --> 00:30:31.190
as a equals 1/2 bh, equals 1/2
Cr, equals 1/2 tau r squared.

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.380
There's simply no avoiding
that factor of a half.

00:30:37.454 --> 00:30:39.120
All right, I've been
doing this a while.

00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:41.700
So as you might imagine,
I've fielded a lot

00:30:41.700 --> 00:30:42.950
of questions over the years.

00:30:42.950 --> 00:30:45.120
So this is just a few of
the most frequently asked

00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:46.102
questions.

00:30:48.760 --> 00:30:50.980
One question people ask is
won't tau confuse students

00:30:50.980 --> 00:30:52.230
if they already know about pi.

00:30:52.230 --> 00:30:54.920
This is too complicated.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:30:58.270
So in this context, I'd like
to show you a tau testimonial.

00:30:58.270 --> 00:31:01.487
I'm sorry, surely I
mean a taustimonial.

00:31:01.487 --> 00:31:03.070
I'm not going to
read the whole thing.

00:31:03.070 --> 00:31:04.700
But I just want to give
you the background here.

00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:06.241
There was a student,
who at the time,

00:31:06.241 --> 00:31:08.950
was an undergraduate at
MIT, was trying to help

00:31:08.950 --> 00:31:10.540
his sister, who
was in high school,

00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:12.280
with an upcoming
trigonometry exam.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:14.120
And she was really struggling.

00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:17.020
So he was showing her
everything the standard way.

00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:19.600
And finally he said
no, no, screw this.

00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.490
I'm going to do this
the correct way,

00:31:21.490 --> 00:31:23.860
and he switched to using tau.

00:31:23.860 --> 00:31:27.610
And she grokked it,
using the term grok

00:31:27.610 --> 00:31:30.330
from Robert Heinlein's
"Stranger in a Strange Land"

00:31:30.330 --> 00:31:33.190
to indicate that she
really understood it.

00:31:33.190 --> 00:31:35.200
When the test came, her
strategy for the test

00:31:35.200 --> 00:31:37.480
was to do every problem
with the tau circle,

00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.040
and then to sweep
over it at the end

00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:41.014
and convert every tau to 2 pi.

00:31:41.014 --> 00:31:42.430
She was the first
one in her class

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:45.500
to finish the test with 100%.

00:31:45.500 --> 00:31:49.144
So in fact, tau is much
less confusing than pi.

00:31:49.144 --> 00:31:51.310
I also think it's worth
noting that the idea that pi

00:31:51.310 --> 00:31:52.790
might be wrong is interesting.

00:31:52.790 --> 00:31:54.340
So this is a way
of hooking people

00:31:54.340 --> 00:31:56.500
into having an
interest in a subject

00:31:56.500 --> 00:31:58.640
that some people might
consider a little dry.

00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:04.770
Another objection that
people raise is say well,

00:32:04.770 --> 00:32:05.970
isn't it too late to switch.

00:32:05.970 --> 00:32:07.678
They tell me, OK,
like, I kind of get it,

00:32:07.678 --> 00:32:10.466
but wouldn't we have to
rewrite all the textbooks.

00:32:10.466 --> 00:32:11.340
And the answer is no.

00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.040
We just saw that you can
make a change inferentially.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:16.890
You can always
substitute tau into pi

00:32:16.890 --> 00:32:18.630
for each other mechanically.

00:32:18.630 --> 00:32:24.400
So there's really no need to
make the change all at once.

00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.607
If you're trying to
redefine what pi means,

00:32:26.607 --> 00:32:27.690
then it would be hopeless.

00:32:27.690 --> 00:32:30.210
But this can be an
incremental change over time.

00:32:30.210 --> 00:32:34.620
And as we saw, there's already
a textbook that uses it.

00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:37.290
So the second to last
question is alarmingly common.

00:32:37.290 --> 00:32:40.020
And so I'll allow
Natalie Portman to ask it

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:41.820
on behalf of everyone else.

00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.680
Thank you, Natalie.

00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:51.270
No, I'm not a crazy person,
apart from my usual shirt,

00:32:51.270 --> 00:32:52.920
I'm practically
normal in every way.

00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:55.440
You'd never guess from
looking at me on any other day

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:59.130
that I'm anything other
than a normal person.

00:32:59.130 --> 00:33:00.860
You'd never guess
that I'm in fact

00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:03.135
a notorious mathematical
propagandist.

00:33:03.135 --> 00:33:05.760
But I think when people ask this
question what they really mean

00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:08.010
is that this isn't like
your full time thing, right?

00:33:08.010 --> 00:33:10.050
You're not like a full
time tau activist.

00:33:10.050 --> 00:33:11.654
No, I do other stuff.

00:33:11.654 --> 00:33:13.320
I'm actually the
author of a bestselling

00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.380
book on web development, called
the "Ruby on Rails Tutorial."

00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:18.750
There's an overlapping audience
for these two products,

00:33:18.750 --> 00:33:20.610
for "The Tau Manifesto"
and the "Rails Tutorial."

00:33:20.610 --> 00:33:22.200
So every once in a while
someone will tweet out,

00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.610
saying, oh, my god,
I just realized

00:33:23.610 --> 00:33:24.810
that the author of
"The Tau Manifesto"

00:33:24.810 --> 00:33:26.893
is the same as the author
of the "Rails Tutorial."

00:33:26.893 --> 00:33:27.780
Like what?

00:33:27.780 --> 00:33:30.290
They're slight different in
tone, as you might imagine.

00:33:30.290 --> 00:33:33.540
And this has now become part
of my current venture, which

00:33:33.540 --> 00:33:36.210
is an educational
products company, called

00:33:36.210 --> 00:33:38.610
Learn Enough to be Dangerous
at learnenough.com.

00:33:38.610 --> 00:33:40.440
So this is not my full time gig.

00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:43.500
I do other stuff.

00:33:43.500 --> 00:33:47.010
All right, the final
question, it's important.

00:33:47.010 --> 00:33:48.520
It seems lighthearted.

00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.900
But I really feel
like it captures

00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:55.440
something essential for any
sort of movement like this.

00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:57.840
But what about puns.

00:33:57.840 --> 00:33:58.730
Right pi is fun.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.490
It's like pi in
the sky, pi around,

00:34:00.490 --> 00:34:02.970
we have this tasty dessert.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:05.429
And this was actually one
of the things about tau

00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:07.470
that I was really pleased
about, when I realized,

00:34:07.470 --> 00:34:11.031
you know what, there's a lot of
potential here for making puns.

00:34:11.031 --> 00:34:13.530
And if you're going to try to
insert this into geek culture,

00:34:13.530 --> 00:34:15.400
that matters.

00:34:15.400 --> 00:34:19.989
So for example, we can
see here's the tau.

00:34:19.989 --> 00:34:20.820
We're all Tauists.

00:34:20.820 --> 00:34:22.320
So what I've done
here is I've taken

00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:25.290
the traditional symbol of
Tauism, the yin yang symbol,

00:34:25.290 --> 00:34:27.429
and rotated it.

00:34:27.429 --> 00:34:27.929
How far?

00:34:27.929 --> 00:34:32.219
I've rotated it a quarter
turn, or tau with four radians.

00:34:32.219 --> 00:34:33.060
So what is this?

00:34:33.060 --> 00:34:34.320
Is this pi?

00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:37.080
This is yang.

00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:39.783
This is only halfway around.

00:34:39.783 --> 00:34:41.699
We have to go all the
way around to understand

00:34:41.699 --> 00:34:44.360
the true nature of the tau.

00:34:44.360 --> 00:34:49.179
And so using pi instead of tau
is like having yang with yin.

00:34:49.179 --> 00:34:51.179
And we can relate this
to Euler's identity

00:34:51.179 --> 00:34:53.130
by noticing that e
to the i tau equals

00:34:53.130 --> 00:34:55.380
1 says be one with the tau.

00:34:57.940 --> 00:35:03.150
A rotation by one turn is 1
may sound like a tautology,

00:35:03.150 --> 00:35:05.070
but in fact, it is the
true nature of the tau.

00:35:07.890 --> 00:35:10.800
Finally, even as we contemplate
tau's mystical implications,

00:35:10.800 --> 00:35:15.180
we must remember that Tauism is
based on reason, not on faith.

00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:16.730
Tauists are never Pious.

00:35:22.530 --> 00:35:25.620
So I hope you'll join
me in celebrating

00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:27.840
the true circle
constant, C over r,

00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:31.890
and I hope you'll also
join me in calling it tau.

00:35:31.890 --> 00:35:34.110
I'd like to leave you
with some words of wisdom,

00:35:34.110 --> 00:35:38.400
some words that have a great
deep and personal meaning

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.340
to me, and I hope they'll have
a meaning for you as well.

00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:46.430
Those words are 6.

00:35:46.430 --> 00:35:59.980
2831853071795864769
2528676655900576839 4338502116.

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:00.790
Thank you.

00:36:00.790 --> 00:36:04.440
