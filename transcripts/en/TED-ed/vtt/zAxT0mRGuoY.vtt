00:00:14.715 --> 00:00:20.690
It may sound like a paradox, or some
cruel joke, but whatever it is, it's true.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:25.217
Beethoven, the composer of some of
the most celebrated music in history,

00:00:25.217 --> 00:00:29.631
spent most of his career going deaf.

00:00:29.631 --> 00:00:34.273
So how was he still able to create such
intricate and moving compositions?

00:00:34.273 --> 00:00:38.652
The answer lies in the patterns
hidden beneath the beautiful sounds.

00:00:38.652 --> 00:00:41.431
Let's take a look at the famous
"Moonlight Sonata,"

00:00:41.431 --> 00:00:45.772
which opens with a slow, steady stream
of notes grouped into triplets:

00:00:45.772 --> 00:00:54.571
One-and-a-two-and-a-three-and-a.

00:00:54.571 --> 00:00:56.733
But though they sound deceptively simple,

00:00:56.733 --> 00:01:00.101
each triplet contains an
elegant melodic structure,

00:01:00.101 --> 00:01:05.102
revealing the fascinating relationship
between music and math.

00:01:05.102 --> 00:01:06.194
Beethoven once said,

00:01:06.194 --> 00:01:11.092
"I always have a picture in my mind 
when composing and follow its lines."

00:01:11.092 --> 00:01:16.657
Similarly, we can picture a standard
piano octave consisting of thirteen keys,

00:01:16.657 --> 00:01:18.952
each separated by a half step.

00:01:18.952 --> 00:01:23.049
A standard major or minor scale uses
eight of these keys,

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:27.174
with five whole step intervals
and two half step ones.

00:01:27.174 --> 00:01:29.868
And the first half of measure 50,
for example,

00:01:29.868 --> 00:01:32.653
consists of three notes in D major,

00:01:32.653 --> 00:01:37.889
separated by intervals called thirds,
that skip over the next note in the scale.

00:01:37.889 --> 00:01:43.722
By stacking the scale's first, third 
and fifth notes, D, F-sharp and A,

00:01:43.722 --> 00:01:47.108
we get a harmonic pattern 
known as a triad.

00:01:47.108 --> 00:01:50.205
But these aren't just arbitrary
magic numbers.

00:01:50.205 --> 00:01:52.931
Rather, they represent 
the mathematical relationship

00:01:52.931 --> 00:01:58.357
between the pitch frequencies of different
notes which form a geometric series.

00:01:58.357 --> 00:02:01.869
If we begin with the note A3 at 220 hertz,

00:02:01.869 --> 00:02:04.396
the series can be expressed 
with this equation,

00:02:04.396 --> 00:02:07.904
where "n" corresponds to successive 
notes on the keyboard.

00:02:07.904 --> 00:02:14.443
The D major triplet from the Moonlight
Sonata uses "n" values five, nine, and twelve.

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:19.242
And by plugging these into the function,
we can graph the sine wave for each note,

00:02:19.242 --> 00:02:23.741
allowing us to see the patterns
that Beethoven could not hear.

00:02:23.741 --> 00:02:25.820
When all three of the 
sine waves are graphed,

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:32.686
they intersect at their starting point
of 0,0 and again at 0,0.042.

00:02:32.686 --> 00:02:36.659
Within this span, 
the D goes through two full cycles,

00:02:36.662 --> 00:02:40.820
F-sharp through two and a half,
and A goes through three.

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:45.811
This pattern is known as consonance,
which sounds naturally pleasant to our ears.

00:02:45.811 --> 00:02:50.291
But perhaps equally captivating is
Beethoven's use of dissonance.

00:02:50.291 --> 00:02:53.549
Take a look at measures 52 through 54,

00:02:53.549 --> 00:02:56.698
which feature triplets containing
the notes B and C.

00:02:56.698 --> 00:03:01.058
As their sine graphs show,
the waves are largely out of sync,

00:03:01.058 --> 00:03:03.321
matching up rarely, if at all.

00:03:03.321 --> 00:03:05.600
And it is by contrasting this dissonance

00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.554
with the consonance of the D major triad 
in the preceding measures

00:03:09.554 --> 00:03:14.545
that Beethoven adds the unquantifiable
elements of emotion and creativity

00:03:14.545 --> 00:03:16.760
to the certainty of mathematics,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:18.949
creating what Hector Berlioz described as

00:03:18.949 --> 00:03:23.712
"one of those poems that human language
does not know how to qualify."

00:03:23.712 --> 00:03:28.375
So although we can investigate the underlying
mathematical patterns of musical pieces,

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:31.885
it is yet to be discovered why
certain sequences of these patterns

00:03:31.885 --> 00:03:35.005
strike the hearts of listeners
in certain ways.

00:03:35.005 --> 00:03:36.767
And Beethoven's true genius lay

00:03:36.767 --> 00:03:40.431
not only in his ability to see
the patterns without hearing the music,

00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:42.660
but to feel their effect.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:44.129
As James Sylvester wrote,

00:03:44.129 --> 00:03:47.658
"May not music be described as the
mathematics of the sense,

00:03:47.658 --> 00:03:50.545
mathematics as music of the reason?"

00:03:50.545 --> 00:03:54.926
The musician feels mathematics. 
The mathematician thinks music.

00:03:54.926 --> 00:03:58.198
Music, the dream. 
Mathematics, the working life.
