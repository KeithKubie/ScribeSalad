you know in the history of our industry
 

00:00:01.469 --> 00:00:03.439
you know in the history of our industry
there have been some real major events

00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
there have been some real major events
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.210
there have been some real major events
that had transformed the industry and

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:05.220
that had transformed the industry and
 

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.730
that had transformed the industry and
had a huge impact in our lives the

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
had a huge impact in our lives the
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.259
had a huge impact in our lives the
invention of the integrated circuit

00:00:09.259 --> 00:00:09.269
invention of the integrated circuit
 

00:00:09.269 --> 00:00:11.390
invention of the integrated circuit
really opened up a huge number of

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:11.400
really opened up a huge number of
 

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.030
really opened up a huge number of
opportunities to do things that were

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.040
opportunities to do things that were
 

00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:16.790
opportunities to do things that were
unimaginable back then then the creation

00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:16.800
unimaginable back then then the creation
 

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.580
unimaginable back then then the creation
of the personal computer the PC that was

00:00:19.580 --> 00:00:19.590
of the personal computer the PC that was
 

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:23.330
of the personal computer the PC that was
a huge impact on our lives not only in

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:23.340
a huge impact on our lives not only in
 

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.279
a huge impact on our lives not only in
our own personal lives but in the way

00:00:25.279 --> 00:00:25.289
our own personal lives but in the way
 

00:00:25.289 --> 00:00:27.800
our own personal lives but in the way
industry conducted itself and how to use

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:27.810
industry conducted itself and how to use
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:29.839
industry conducted itself and how to use
computers to do the things that were

00:00:29.839 --> 00:00:29.849
computers to do the things that were
 

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:32.030
computers to do the things that were
important to them then the third thing

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:32.040
important to them then the third thing
 

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:34.430
important to them then the third thing
was the introduction of course of the

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:34.440
was the introduction of course of the
 

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.130
was the introduction of course of the
Internet I mean that internet with PCs

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:37.140
Internet I mean that internet with PCs

and integrated circuit you can see how

00:00:39.229 --> 00:00:39.239
and integrated circuit you can see how
 

00:00:39.239 --> 00:00:41.780
and integrated circuit you can see how
all that is building and and changing

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:41.790
all that is building and and changing
 

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:43.400
all that is building and and changing
the world I believe that the next step

00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:43.410
the world I believe that the next step
 

00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:45.049
the world I believe that the next step
is going to be what's called cognitive

00:00:45.049 --> 00:00:45.059
is going to be what's called cognitive
 

00:00:45.059 --> 00:00:47.479
is going to be what's called cognitive
computing because technology has changed

00:00:47.479 --> 00:00:47.489
computing because technology has changed
 

00:00:47.489 --> 00:00:49.520
computing because technology has changed
so much that we have not so much power

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:49.530
so much that we have not so much power
 

00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:52.040
so much that we have not so much power
in our computing capability and so much

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:52.050
in our computing capability and so much
 

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:54.830
in our computing capability and so much
memory that we can store that we're able

00:00:54.830 --> 00:00:54.840
memory that we can store that we're able
 

00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:56.240
memory that we can store that we're able
for the first time to actually create

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:56.250
for the first time to actually create
 

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.060
for the first time to actually create
products that begin to mimic how our

00:00:59.060 --> 00:00:59.070
products that begin to mimic how our
 

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.069
products that begin to mimic how our
brain works and what that means is that

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
brain works and what that means is that
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:04.039
brain works and what that means is that
the product can actually on a very

00:01:04.039 --> 00:01:04.049
the product can actually on a very
 

00:01:04.049 --> 00:01:06.980
the product can actually on a very
narrow particularly expertise could be

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:06.990
narrow particularly expertise could be
 

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:08.450
narrow particularly expertise could be
as narrow as let's say weather

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:08.460
as narrow as let's say weather
 

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:10.580

narrow that the product begins to learn
as it is used and in a way that means it

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:16.890
as it is used and in a way that means it
 

00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:19.130
as it is used and in a way that means it
has some cognitive capability so the

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
has some cognitive capability so the
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.830
has some cognitive capability so the
more you use it the better it becomes at

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
more you use it the better it becomes at
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:24.560
more you use it the better it becomes at
a particular function to the point where

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:24.570
a particular function to the point where
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:25.910
a particular function to the point where
it actually gets to a point where he

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:25.920
it actually gets to a point where he
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:28.219
it actually gets to a point where he
begins to actually ask questions of you

00:01:28.219 --> 00:01:28.229
begins to actually ask questions of you
 

00:01:28.229 --> 00:01:30.679
begins to actually ask questions of you
think of it as a child you know when a

00:01:30.679 --> 00:01:30.689
think of it as a child you know when a
 

00:01:30.689 --> 00:01:33.260
think of it as a child you know when a
child is born their brain is empty

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:33.270
child is born their brain is empty
 

00:01:33.270 --> 00:01:35.450
child is born their brain is empty
begins to get filled with stuff

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:35.460
begins to get filled with stuff
 

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:37.940
begins to get filled with stuff
hopefully mostly good but you know it

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:37.950
hopefully mostly good but you know it
 

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.039
hopefully mostly good but you know it
comes a point in time when the child

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
comes a point in time when the child
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:42.350
comes a point in time when the child
touches a hot plate and the mother says

00:01:42.350 --> 00:01:42.360
touches a hot plate and the mother says
 

00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:45.770
touches a hot plate and the mother says
hot then the child knows from then on

00:01:45.770 --> 00:01:45.780
hot then the child knows from then on
 

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.530
hot then the child knows from then on
every time somebody says hot he better

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:48.540
every time somebody says hot he better
 

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.780
every time somebody says hot he better
be careful because now his program in

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:50.790
be careful because now his program in
 

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:53.120
be careful because now his program in
his brain and he's learning it continues

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
his brain and he's learning it continues
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.560
his brain and he's learning it continues
to learn but there comes that time in

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:54.570
to learn but there comes that time in
 

00:01:54.570 --> 00:01:57.289
to learn but there comes that time in
the child's life that all of us that

00:01:57.289 --> 00:01:57.299
the child's life that all of us that
 

00:01:57.299 --> 00:02:00.950
the child's life that all of us that
have been parents either dread or look

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:00.960
have been parents either dread or look
 

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:02.569
have been parents either dread or look
forward to it when the child starts

00:02:02.569 --> 00:02:02.579
forward to it when the child starts
 

00:02:02.579 --> 00:02:04.969
forward to it when the child starts
asking why you know when you do

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
asking why you know when you do
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:07.850
asking why you know when you do
something you say why why what where the

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:07.860
something you say why why what where the
 

00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:10.609
something you say why why what where the
child soon is learning he now has enough

00:02:10.609 --> 00:02:10.619
child soon is learning he now has enough
 

00:02:10.619 --> 00:02:12.680
child soon is learning he now has enough
cognitive capability

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:12.690
cognitive capability
 

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:15.230
cognitive capability
understand enough of what's going on but

00:02:15.230 --> 00:02:15.240
understand enough of what's going on but
 

00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.020
understand enough of what's going on but
not enough so he'll ask why well in the

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:18.030
not enough so he'll ask why well in the
 

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.330
not enough so he'll ask why well in the
same way these circuits get to a point

00:02:20.330 --> 00:02:20.340
same way these circuits get to a point
 

00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.160
same way these circuits get to a point
where actually they begin to query back

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.170
where actually they begin to query back
 

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.200
where actually they begin to query back
and say I need more information give me

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:24.210
and say I need more information give me
 

00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:26.320
and say I need more information give me
more information tell me about this and

00:02:26.320 --> 00:02:26.330
more information tell me about this and
 

00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:28.670
more information tell me about this and
there are some experiments going today

00:02:28.670 --> 00:02:28.680
there are some experiments going today
 

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.670
there are some experiments going today
on healthcare in oil exploration in

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:31.680
on healthcare in oil exploration in
 

00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.110
on healthcare in oil exploration in
financial transactions where they

00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:33.120
financial transactions where they
 

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.330
financial transactions where they
actually begin to tap the power of

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:35.340
actually begin to tap the power of
 

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.580
actually begin to tap the power of
cognitive computing and I believe that

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:37.590
cognitive computing and I believe that
 

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:40.520
cognitive computing and I believe that
when that happens we're gonna enter an

00:02:40.520 --> 00:02:40.530
when that happens we're gonna enter an
 

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.390
when that happens we're gonna enter an
era that's unimaginable today and in

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:44.400
era that's unimaginable today and in
 

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.160
era that's unimaginable today and in
some ways it's kind of exciting to think

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:46.170
some ways it's kind of exciting to think
 

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:47.840
some ways it's kind of exciting to think
about the fact that we could surround it

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:47.850
about the fact that we could surround it
 

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.480
about the fact that we could surround it
by intelligence that helps us make our

00:02:50.480 --> 00:02:50.490
by intelligence that helps us make our
 

00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:52.370
by intelligence that helps us make our
lives better but it's also somewhat

00:02:52.370 --> 00:02:52.380
lives better but it's also somewhat
 

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.350
lives better but it's also somewhat
frightening and the fact that you're not

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:54.360
frightening and the fact that you're not
 

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.060
frightening and the fact that you're not
surrounded by intelligence that begins

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:56.070
surrounded by intelligence that begins
 

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:57.740
surrounded by intelligence that begins
to think they know more than you do and

00:02:57.740 --> 00:02:57.750
to think they know more than you do and
 

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.530
to think they know more than you do and
and but we're moving in that direction I

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:00.540
and but we're moving in that direction I
 

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.660
and but we're moving in that direction I
see it happening I think we're about 10

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:02.670
see it happening I think we're about 10
 

00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:04.760
see it happening I think we're about 10
years away from that being a real

00:03:04.760 --> 00:03:04.770
years away from that being a real
 

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.820
years away from that being a real
commercial reality however the work I've

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:07.830
commercial reality however the work I've
 

00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:09.800
commercial reality however the work I've
seen done in healthcare and oil

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:09.810
seen done in healthcare and oil

tells me that this thing is it's very

00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:15.150
tells me that this thing is it's very
 

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:17.960
tells me that this thing is it's very
real and I'll give you one small example

00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:17.970
real and I'll give you one small example
 

00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.930
real and I'll give you one small example
of how powerful it can be cannot

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:20.940
of how powerful it can be cannot

of how powerful it can be cannot
disclose the names of the companies but

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:22.320
disclose the names of the companies but
 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.010
disclose the names of the companies but
in one particular example is they've

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:25.020
in one particular example is they've
 

00:03:25.020 --> 00:03:27.110
in one particular example is they've
looked at the data on a particular

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.120
looked at the data on a particular
 

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:29.780
looked at the data on a particular
medicine that was used to you know to

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
medicine that was used to you know to
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.210
medicine that was used to you know to
treat patients and the way things have

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:32.220
treat patients and the way things have
 

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.130
treat patients and the way things have
been done up to now is you get a

00:03:34.130 --> 00:03:34.140
been done up to now is you get a
 

00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:36.500
been done up to now is you get a
medicine you get FDA approval and then

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:36.510
medicine you get FDA approval and then
 

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:38.510
medicine you get FDA approval and then
you put it out and then you collect data

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:38.520
you put it out and then you collect data
 

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:40.610
you put it out and then you collect data
and about 10 years later you say you

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:40.620
and about 10 years later you say you
 

00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.020
and about 10 years later you say you
know what we're gonna take the medicine

00:03:42.020 --> 00:03:42.030
know what we're gonna take the medicine
 

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:44.930
know what we're gonna take the medicine
off the market because it's causing some

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:44.940
off the market because it's causing some
 

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:48.530
off the market because it's causing some
major problem well they took an example

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
major problem well they took an example
 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.570
major problem well they took an example
like that and say let's pretend that we

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:50.580
like that and say let's pretend that we
 

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.940
like that and say let's pretend that we
had this cognitive capability back then

00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:52.950
had this cognitive capability back then
 

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:55.610
had this cognitive capability back then
and fitted the data that we had and see

00:03:55.610 --> 00:03:55.620
and fitted the data that we had and see
 

00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.490
and fitted the data that we had and see
what happens well this actually

00:03:57.490 --> 00:03:57.500
what happens well this actually
 

00:03:57.500 --> 00:04:00.580
what happens well this actually
cognitive machine was able to predict

00:04:00.580 --> 00:04:00.590
cognitive machine was able to predict
 

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.890
cognitive machine was able to predict
within a matter of weeks of the product

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:03.900
within a matter of weeks of the product
 

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:06.590
within a matter of weeks of the product
being on the market what took ten years

00:04:06.590 --> 00:04:06.600
being on the market what took ten years
 

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:10.540
being on the market what took ten years
of collecting data so you can see how

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:10.550
of collecting data so you can see how
 

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.470
of collecting data so you can see how
powerful something like that could be

00:04:12.470 --> 00:04:12.480
powerful something like that could be
 

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:14.479
powerful something like that could be
and what it does is because the

00:04:14.479 --> 00:04:14.489
and what it does is because the
 

00:04:14.489 --> 00:04:17.240
and what it does is because the
computing capabilities so fast and the

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
computing capabilities so fast and the
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.909
computing capabilities so fast and the
amount of memory so large in a very

00:04:19.909 --> 00:04:19.919
amount of memory so large in a very
 

00:04:19.919 --> 00:04:23.710
amount of memory so large in a very
narrow segment it can do what let's say

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:23.720
narrow segment it can do what let's say
 

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:26.330
narrow segment it can do what let's say
10,000 people would do if you could get

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:26.340
10,000 people would do if you could get
 

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:26.780
10,000 people would do if you could get
a multi

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:26.790
a multi
 

00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.140
a multi
to look at one problem and so it is I

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:30.150
to look at one problem and so it is I
 

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.650
to look at one problem and so it is I
see this to me as the next revolution in

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:33.660
see this to me as the next revolution in
 

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.690
see this to me as the next revolution in
technology and will impact everything

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:35.700
technology and will impact everything
 

00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:38.180
technology and will impact everything
that we do
