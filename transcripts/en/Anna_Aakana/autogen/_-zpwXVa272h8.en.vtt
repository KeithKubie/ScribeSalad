00:00:00.368 --> 00:00:02.775
We lose friends for a variety of reasons.

00:00:02.775 --> 00:00:03.674
People move.

00:00:03.674 --> 00:00:05.369
I don't want to move to New York.

00:00:05.369 --> 00:00:06.448
But...

00:00:06.448 --> 00:00:07.831
they just have better pizza.

00:00:07.831 --> 00:00:08.949
You get into fights.

00:00:08.949 --> 00:00:09.862
Dude!

00:00:09.862 --> 00:00:11.480
How many times do I have to tell you...

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:13.483
that Los Angeles has great pizza?!

00:00:13.483 --> 00:00:14.739
Life gets crazy.

00:00:14.739 --> 00:00:16.632
We could probably get together on...

00:00:16.632 --> 00:00:17.370
Thursday...

00:00:18.254 --> 00:00:19.269
of January...

00:00:20.330 --> 00:00:21.631
2017...

00:00:22.253 --> 00:00:23.449
No matter what the reason,

00:00:23.449 --> 00:00:25.392
we all know what it's like to lose a friend,

00:00:25.392 --> 00:00:27.043
and...it sucks.

00:00:27.043 --> 00:00:29.708
It's kinda like a breakup where you have this period

00:00:29.708 --> 00:00:31.800
of being...just sad.

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:32.983
And you wanna call them

00:00:32.983 --> 00:00:34.949
and you wanna know where it all went wrong...

00:00:34.949 --> 00:00:37.136
and you're mourning, and you're moping,

00:00:37.136 --> 00:00:38.877
until finally one day...

00:00:38.877 --> 00:00:41.418
you wish them well,
and you move on with your life.

00:00:41.418 --> 00:00:43.863
The first step is to self-reflect.

00:00:43.863 --> 00:00:47.132
And to try to find something that you learned
from the friendship.

00:00:47.132 --> 00:00:49.918
Because something about...mentally learning something

00:00:49.918 --> 00:00:53.801
from an experience makes it feel whole. and complete.

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.076
And, in essence, finished.

00:00:56.076 --> 00:01:01.072
Second, Don't let this experience deter you
from emotionally engaging from other people.

00:01:01.072 --> 00:01:04.012
Don't let one experience with someone

00:01:04.012 --> 00:01:07.575
completely change how you interact with other people.

00:01:07.575 --> 00:01:08.755
And finally,

00:01:08.755 --> 00:01:10.805
let yourself feel the feelings.

00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:13.331
There are so many times when our past comes up,

00:01:13.331 --> 00:01:14.892
and...we just want to push it away.

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:16.449
Or our first instinct is to be like,

00:01:16.449 --> 00:01:18.979
"Oh don't think about that! FUCK THAT!
FUCK. THAT."

00:01:18.979 --> 00:01:21.678
But, it's important to give yourself permission.

00:01:21.678 --> 00:01:23.269
So if you miss someone,

00:01:23.269 --> 00:01:25.708
let yourself just miss them.

00:01:25.708 --> 00:01:27.638
And, be like, "You know what, that's fine.

00:01:27.638 --> 00:01:30.178
I really miss that person, in this moment,

00:01:30.178 --> 00:01:31.861
but it's over for a reason."

00:01:31.861 --> 00:01:33.178
And let yourself sit with that

00:01:33.178 --> 00:01:34.709
for as long as you need to sit with that.

00:01:34.709 --> 00:01:36.979
Ultimately, we're all gonna lose a lot of friends
throughout our life.

00:01:36.979 --> 00:01:40.133
But we're also gonna gain a lot of friends
and a lot of experiences.

00:01:40.133 --> 00:01:43.136
So, it works out! Hey~

00:01:43.136 --> 00:01:44.449
Stay awesome, Gotham.

00:01:44.449 --> 00:01:45.224
Ha~!

00:01:45.224 --> 00:01:51.542
