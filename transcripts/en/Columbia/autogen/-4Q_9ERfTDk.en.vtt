not just the next day kind of way and so
we<00:04:03.640><c> talked</c><00:04:03.820><c> about</c><00:04:03.940><c> it</c><00:04:04.120><c> and</c><00:04:04.209><c> I</c><00:04:04.420><c> think</c><00:04:04.630><c> we</c><00:04:04.810><c> both</c>

00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:52.900 align:start position:0%

00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:53.710 align:start position:0%
started to actually create a animation
 

00:15:53.710 --> 00:15:57.330 align:start position:0%
started to actually create a animation

the slope of the mountain and then we
 

00:16:05.140 --> 00:16:08.580 align:start position:0%
the slope of the mountain and then we
mapped<00:16:05.770><c> that</c><00:16:06.040><c> to</c><00:16:06.370><c> our</c><00:16:06.790><c> 3d</c><00:16:07.420><c> model</c><00:16:07.780><c> you</c><00:16:08.350><c> can</c><00:16:08.440><c> sort</c>

00:16:08.580 --> 00:16:08.590 align:start position:0%
mapped that to our 3d model you can sort

00:16:10.380 --> 00:16:10.390 align:start position:0%
of see the stages of it here and then we
 

00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:11.700 align:start position:0%
of see the stages of it here and then we
started<00:16:10.450><c> to</c><00:16:10.780><c> kind</c><00:16:10.960><c> of</c><00:16:11.020><c> style</c><00:16:11.260><c> eyes</c><00:16:11.440><c> it</c><00:16:11.590><c> and</c>

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:11.710 align:start position:0%
started to kind of style eyes it and
 

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:15.090 align:start position:0%
started to kind of style eyes it and
simplify<00:16:12.130><c> it</c><00:16:12.190><c> so</c><00:16:12.430><c> that</c><00:16:12.610><c> it</c><00:16:13.530><c> became</c><00:16:14.530><c> something</c>

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:15.100 align:start position:0%
simplify it so that it became something
 

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.580 align:start position:0%
simplify it so that it became something
that<00:16:15.250><c> was</c><00:16:15.400><c> understandable</c><00:16:16.090><c> and</c><00:16:16.360><c> then</c><00:16:16.630><c> we</c><00:16:16.810><c> you</c>

00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:17.590 align:start position:0%
that was understandable and then we you
 

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:21.120 align:start position:0%
that was understandable and then we you

00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:41.990 align:start position:0%
questions in avalanche and then open it
 

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:46.480 align:start position:0%

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:49.460 align:start position:0%
there's an avalanche of questioners here
 

00:16:49.460 --> 00:16:52.630 align:start position:0%
there's an avalanche of questioners here
yes<00:16:50.420><c> please</c><00:16:50.660><c> go</c><00:16:50.720><c> ahead</c><00:16:51.020><c> hi</c><00:16:51.410><c> Jenny</c><00:16:51.890><c> again</c><00:16:52.310><c> and</c>

yeah of course everyone saw this when it
came<00:16:55.790><c> out</c><00:16:55.820><c> and</c><00:16:56.240><c> people</c><00:16:56.450><c> are</c><00:16:56.720><c> still</c><00:16:56.960><c> continue</c>

00:16:57.430 --> 00:16:57.440 align:start position:0%
came out and people are still continue
 

00:16:57.440 --> 00:16:59.500 align:start position:0%
came out and people are still continue
to<00:16:57.470><c> talk</c><00:16:57.740><c> about</c><00:16:57.920><c> it</c><00:16:58.190><c> simply</c><00:16:58.940><c> because</c><00:16:59.090><c> we</c>

00:16:59.500 --> 00:16:59.510 align:start position:0%
to talk about it simply because we
 

00:16:59.510 --> 00:17:01.960 align:start position:0%
to talk about it simply because we

00:17:01.960 --> 00:17:01.970 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it duplicated yet can you
 

00:17:01.970 --> 00:17:03.700 align:start position:0%
haven't seen it duplicated yet can you
talk<00:17:02.300><c> to</c><00:17:02.510><c> us</c><00:17:02.540><c> a</c><00:17:02.660><c> little</c><00:17:02.870><c> bit</c><00:17:03.170><c> about</c><00:17:03.410><c> maybe</c>

00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:03.710 align:start position:0%
talk to us a little bit about maybe
 

00:17:03.710 --> 00:17:06.640 align:start position:0%
talk to us a little bit about maybe

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:11.540 align:start position:0%
into making a project like this and why
 

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:13.780 align:start position:0%
into making a project like this and why
maybe<00:17:11.990><c> it</c><00:17:12.470><c> is</c><00:17:12.680><c> such</c><00:17:12.890><c> a</c><00:17:12.920><c> special</c><00:17:13.130><c> thing</c><00:17:13.430><c> right</c>

00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:13.790 align:start position:0%
maybe it is such a special thing right

was my question is like how does it
 

00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:53.510 align:start position:0%
was my question is like how does it

00:28:59.390 --> 00:28:59.400 align:start position:0%
I could see I'll go into a writing it
 

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.640 align:start position:0%
I could see I'll go into a writing it
you<00:28:59.580><c> know</c><00:28:59.700><c> maybe</c><00:29:00.059><c> it's</c><00:29:00.240><c> a</c><00:29:00.360><c> bunch</c><00:29:01.200><c> of</c><00:29:01.290><c> vignettes</c>
