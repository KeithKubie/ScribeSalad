00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:04.400
Grab your safety gear and sign the waiver,
because we’re exploring 5 insane science

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:06.740
stunts you won’t be learning at school.

00:00:09.009 --> 00:00:12.950
Normally we don’t think of metals as being
very dangerous. We use them all the time,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.350
but sodium metal is one that’s extremely
reactive. The second it touches water, it

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:21.640
starts ripping the water molecules apart and
releasing hydrogen gas, which you can see

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:26.970
is highly flammable, and in some cases, explosive.
The vigorous reaction is exothermic, and gets

00:00:26.970 --> 00:00:32.230
so hot, it’ll spontaneously burst into flames,
and can explode. Now, if a piece of wood is thrown

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:37.219
on top, the elemental sodium blasts back with
tremendous power, and sends the wood flying.

00:00:37.219 --> 00:00:41.390
Now the reaction also forms sodium hydroxide,
which is very caustic, and typically used

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:45.469
as a drain cleaner. But you might remember
from a previous video, we can tame that dangerous

00:00:45.469 --> 00:00:51.440
chemical with bacon grease, and make it into
a custom bar of shower soap.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.829
For this next experiment we need a plastic
soda bottle filled a third of the way with

00:00:54.829 --> 00:00:59.390
lukewarm water, and a little bit of liquid
nitrogen. Now if we pour a bit of the cryogenic

00:00:59.390 --> 00:01:04.260
fluid into the bottle and simply turn it upside
down, the bottle blasts off with tremendous

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:09.370
force. Now we’ve got a high risk, hand-held
rocket launcher. This works because the liquid

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:13.180
nitrogen floats on the water and the gas can
escape out the top. But when the bottle is

00:01:13.180 --> 00:01:17.900
turned over, the liquids trade places, and
the nitrogen is instantly vaporized, blasting

00:01:17.900 --> 00:01:22.160
water out the nozzle with incredible pressure.
These bottles can shoot hundreds of feet at

00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.330
high velocity, which apparently is enough
power to break clean through my kitchen window.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:29.640
There’s also a risk of these blowing up
in your hand, so why don’t we move on to

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:34.680
the next experiment while we’re still in
once piece.

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.680
Now one way to super-charge a halloween party
is with a spellbinding blast-o-lantern. Just

00:01:39.680 --> 00:01:43.670
pour a bit of calcium carbide into a small
plastic cup, then carefully set it inside

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:47.900
a pre-carved pumpkin. When all the pieces
of the pumpkin are back in place, simply pour

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:51.770
in a bit of water, and put the lid back on
top. The pumpkin will slowly fill up with

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.480
highly flammable acetylene gas. So as you
might be able to guess, we’re going to light

00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:00.150
that off with a fuse. Now when the spark hits
the gas, it blasts out, a sinister looking

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.820
face, with a startling amount of power. Your
guests will probably find this trick extremely

00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.750
amusing, because anytime you mix oxyacetylene
gas with a pumpkin, it’s bound to get a

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:12.720
very spirited reaction.

00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.690
With some simple engineering, you can turn
a junk microwave like this, into an electrical

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:21.690
metal melter, that will pump out a shocking
800 amps, of metal melting current. We just

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:26.060
need to break inside, to access the electronics,
then locate this awesome piece of equipment

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:31.800
.. a 1500 watt microwave oven transformer.
Now there are 2 coils on this beast. A primary

00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.200
and a secondary, and if we cut off the secondary
and replace it with 2 gauge insulated cable,

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:40.860
we’ve got ourselves an incredible device
that will melt metal in just a few seconds.

00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:44.550
When it gets turned on, it pumps out a staggering
amount of electrical current, which you can

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:49.130
see is enough to reduce a machine screw, to
a flowing river of molten metal. It’ll also

00:02:49.130 --> 00:02:53.910
weld sheet metal, melt neodymium magnets,
and heat steel until it’s glowing hot, just

00:02:53.910 --> 00:02:58.790
in case you’re in the mood for a little
amateur blacksmithing.

00:02:58.790 --> 00:03:02.460
For this last experiment we’re making pie,
but trust me, you don’t want to eat this

00:03:02.460 --> 00:03:06.470
one. We’ll need to take this recipe outside
and away from anything flammable, and get

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:11.460
started by mixing precise amounts of sugar
and potassium nitrate. This is a highly flammable

00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:14.920
mixture already, and the more we shake it,
the faster it’s going to react when we light

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.250
it later on. Now if we warm this powder on
medium-low heat, you can see the sugar begins

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.520
to caramelize and absorb the nitrate salts.
When it’s all melted and mixed together,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:27.130
it kind of looks like pumpkin pie filling,
so why don’t we try pouring it into a pie

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:30.840
crust, and letting it set for a few minutes.
If it weren’t for the fuse sticking out

00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:34.380
of the center, you’d think it was just a
regular pumpkin pie. But watch what happens

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:39.340
if we light it off. It bursts into a fountain
of flames and spews hot ash like a miniature

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:43.740
volcano. This gives a whole new meaning to
the term “Pie”-rotechnics, and this just

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:47.380
might be the first dessert, that burns it’s
own calories.

00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.709
Well there are 5 crazy science stunts you
probably won’t see in the classroom, and

00:03:50.709 --> 00:03:54.220
while I can’t recommend you actually try
these experiments, you know what would happen

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:58.569
if you did. That’s it for now. If you liked
these projects perhaps you’ll like some

00:03:58.569 --> 00:04:02.460
of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:05.060
Well, that was exciting.

00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:08.459
Hey guys, I hope you liked these demonstrations.
They are some of my favorites, probably because

00:04:08.459 --> 00:04:12.020
they’re a little bit dangerous, but that
keeps it real. And if you felt the power and

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:15.500
learned something new, then why don’t you
share this video on Facebook, and Twitter,

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:17.570
and reddit, because it really does help a
lot.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:21.810
Now there’s one thing I need you to do right
now. Click on this video that Alltime10s just

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:26.160
released on their channel. It’s showing
10 Crazy Experiments that Scientists Did To

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.010
Themselves. This is a video you need to see,
and if you don’t know who Alltime10s are

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:31.300
by now, you need to.

00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:35.510
They do some of the best top 10’s videos
on the internet. They have a super popular

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:39.910
YouTube channel, with almost 3,000,000 subscribers,
and as you might have guessed, this video

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:44.290
is in collaboration with theirs. So go check
them out, subscribe to them, and tell them

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.760
that Grant Thompson sent you.

00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.570
Now in the next couple of weeks I’m going
to show you how to make miniature rockets

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.700
that will launch off your desktop, so subscribe
right now, if you haven’t already, because

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.850
I’d really like to see you around in those
project videos.

00:04:55.850 --> 00:04:59.020
Are you still here? Go check out Alltime10s
