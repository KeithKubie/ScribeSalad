00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:02.680
Now even if humans have 99.9% sequence

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:05.660
identity with each other, we just saw that

00:00:05.660 --> 00:00:08.400
that still leaves 3 million letters that could

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.820
be different in the human genome. Now these

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.290
mutations or variations, would be considered alleles when

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:18.520
they affect a particular phenotype. Sometimes, these alleles

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.860
could result in different observable phenotypic traits such

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:25.350
as variations in skin pigmentation. However many genetic

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.650
variations result in little or no

00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:31.300
observable phenotypic variation. For example, can

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:33.830
you indicate the sequence mutation that

00:00:33.830 --> 00:00:37.000
represents the allele causing shortened bone growth?
