00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:03.490
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. History and today we are going to talk

00:00:03.490 --> 00:00:08.410
about one of the most important periods in
American history, the mid-to-late 1970s.

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:10.170
Stan why is there nothing on the chalkboard?

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:12.680
We can’t find a picture of Gerald Ford somewhere
around here?

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.730
Don’t worry Crash Course fans we got one.

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:16.330
Thanks for your support through Subbable.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.949
It paid for this 90 cent Gerald Ford photograph.

00:00:18.949 --> 00:00:22.679
These really are the years where everything
changed in the United States and amidst all

00:00:22.679 --> 00:00:25.169
that turmoil something wonderful was born.

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.169
Mr. Green?

00:00:26.169 --> 00:00:27.169
Mr. Green?

00:00:27.169 --> 00:00:28.380
Strong with the force, this episode is.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.070
No, me from the past, Yoda doesn’t show
up until Empire Strikes Back which came out

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:33.070
in 1980.

00:00:33.070 --> 00:00:34.790
I’m referring of course to the fact that
we were born!

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.070
It’s the beginning of the John Green era!

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:40.620
From here on out, almost everything we discuss
will have happened in my lifetime.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:44.980
Or as most Crash Course viewers refer to it,
“that century before I was born”.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:49.640
But it wasn’t just the birth of me and the
death of Elvis, the late 1970s were truly

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:57.960
a period of momentous change, and for most
Americans it sucked.

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:04.810
Intro
So how Americans reacted to those no good

00:01:04.810 --> 00:01:08.070
very bad years really has shaped the world
in which we find ourselves.

00:01:08.070 --> 00:01:10.790
The big story of the 1970s is economics.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.190
Twenty-five years of broad economic expansion
and prosperity came to a grinding halt in

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.550
the 1970s meaning the our party was over.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.680
And what did we get instead?

00:01:21.680 --> 00:01:23.540
Inflation and extremely slow growth.

00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:24.880
The worst hangover ever.

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.650
Just kidding, the worst hangover was The Depression.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:31.140
The 2nd worst hangover was the 2008 recession,
and then the 3rd worst hangover was Hangover

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.140
Part III.

00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:34.230
It was the 4th worst hangover in American
history.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.880
Narrowly beating out America’s 5th worst
hangover the Hangover Part II.

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.770
What happened to the American economy in the
1970s was the result both of long-term processes

00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:44.380
and unexpected shocks.

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:49.220
The long-term process was the gradual decline
of manufacturing in the U.S. in relation to

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:50.970
competing manufacturing in the rest of the
world.

00:01:50.970 --> 00:01:55.250
Part of this was due to American policy; after
World War II, you’ll remember that we promoted

00:01:55.250 --> 00:02:00.840
the economic growth of Japan, Germany, South
Korea and Taiwan, ignoring the tariffs that

00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.480
they set up to protect nascent industries,
and effectively subsidizing them by providing

00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:06.480
for their defense.

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.340
And not having to build nuclear arsenals of
their own really allowed them to invest in

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.670
their domestic economies.

00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:15.780
And then one day, a bunch of Toyotas and Mercedes
showed up, and you could drive them up to

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:20.040
like 40 thousand miles before they would break
down and we were like, “wait a second”.

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.370
In 1971, for the first time in the 20th century,
America experienced an export trade deficit,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:29.900
importing more goods than it exported, which
is the same problem that my aunt has with

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:30.900
QVC.

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:32.870
I mean, they hardly import anything from her.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:36.840
One reason for this deficit was because the
dollar was linked to gold, making it a strong

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.709
currency but also making American products
more expensive abroad.

00:02:40.709 --> 00:02:45.530
So Nixon took the U.S. off the gold standard,
hoping to make American goods cheaper overseas

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.260
and reduce imports, but that didn’t really
work.

00:02:48.260 --> 00:02:52.170
Because the U.S. was also competing against
cheaper labor costs, and cheaper raw materials,

00:02:52.170 --> 00:02:54.069
and more productive economies.

00:02:54.069 --> 00:02:58.890
And in many cases this growing global competition
put American firms that couldn’t compete

00:02:58.890 --> 00:02:59.890
out of business.

00:02:59.890 --> 00:03:01.680
This was especially true in manufacturing.

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:06.290
In 1960, 38% of Americans worked in manufacturing.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.640
In 1980, it was 28%.

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:10.750
Today, it’s nine.

00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:11.750
Not 9%, nine people.

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:13.380
Stan wants me to tell you that was a joke.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:14.900
It actually is 9%.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.920
Unionized workers were hit particularly hard.

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:22.010
In the 1940s and 1950s unions had won generous
concessions from corporate employers including

00:03:22.010 --> 00:03:27.200
paid vacation, and health benefits, and especially
pensions, which employers would agree to as

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.050
a kind of deferred compensation so that they
wouldn’t have to pay higher w ages to people

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.190
while they were working.

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.940
And this worked great, until people started
to retire.

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:39.870
So by 1970, competition led employers to either
eliminate high-paying manufacturing jobs,

00:03:39.870 --> 00:03:45.190
or else to increase automation, or to shift
workers to lower wage regions of the U.S.

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:46.190
or even overseas.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:47.190
The American South benefitted from this trend
because its anti-union stance was attractive

00:03:47.190 --> 00:03:48.190
to manufacturers.

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:49.190
But then, non-union industries that were already
in the South found that they had no way to

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:50.190
find new workers so the only way to survive
was to move production overseas.

00:03:50.190 --> 00:03:51.190
And also as industries moved production to
the Sunbelt that increased the political influence

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:52.190
of the region, and because the South and Southwest
are generally conservative politically, the

00:03:52.190 --> 00:03:53.190
nation’s politics continued to move to the
right.

00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:54.190
Meanwhile the northern industrial cities,
particularly the Rust Belt of the Midwest,

00:03:54.190 --> 00:03:55.190
were becoming the empty urban playgrounds
that we know and love today.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.170
Detroit and Chicago had lost half of their
manufacturing jobs by 1980 and smaller cities

00:03:58.170 --> 00:03:59.290
fared even worse.

00:03:59.290 --> 00:04:03.700
As industry moved away, they found their tax
bases dried up, and they were unable to provide

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:05.660
even basic services to their citizens.

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.260
I mean with the world of Wall Street fat cats
this is hard to imagine today, but in 1975

00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:11.780
New York City faced bankruptcy.

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:17.419
In addition to these long term structural
changes to the American economy and our demographics,

00:04:17.419 --> 00:04:21.449
the 1970s saw two oil shocks that sent the
economy into a tailspin.

00:04:21.449 --> 00:04:26.639
In 1973, in response to Western support of
Israel, Middle Eastern Arab states suspended

00:04:26.639 --> 00:04:30.230
oil exports to the U.S which led to the price
of oil quadrupling.

00:04:30.230 --> 00:04:35.350
This resulted in long lines for gasoline,
dramatically higher oil prices, and Americans

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:40.570
deciding to purchase smaller, more fuel efficient
cars, which is to say Japanese cars.

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:44.980
Also, prices of everything else went up because
oil is either used for the production of or

00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:47.780
transportation of just about everything.

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:51.280
I mean with 70’s inflation, this 90 cent
portrait of Gerald Ford would have cost at

00:04:51.280 --> 00:04:52.280
least $1.10.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:55.630
The paint that covers the green parts of not-America,
oil based.

00:04:55.630 --> 00:04:59.650
The plastic that comprises the DVD’s of
Crash Course World History, available now

00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:01.440
at DFTBA.com, oil based.

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.440
Those were a fantastic bargain and they would
have been way more expensive if the price

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.440
of oil was higher.

00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.900
And then, in 1979, a second oil shock hit
the United States after the Iranian revolution.

00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.320
Wait Stan, did we say 1979?

00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:13.199
We’ve got to put up a picture of Jimmy Carter.

00:05:13.199 --> 00:05:14.199
Bam!

00:05:14.199 --> 00:05:16.710
Sorry, Gerald Ford there’s a peanut farmer
in town.

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:22.850
So during the 1970s inflation soared to 10%
a year and economic growth slowed to 2.4%,

00:05:22.850 --> 00:05:25.750
resulting in what came to be known as stagflation.

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:30.600
Unemployment rose, and a new economic statistic
was born: the misery index, the combination

00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.720
of unemployment and inflation.

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.620
At the beginning of the decade it was 10.8,
by 1980 it had doubled.

00:05:36.620 --> 00:05:41.300
If you’re looking for the roots of America’s
contemporary economic inequality, the 1970s

00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:46.530
are a good milestone, since according to our
old friend Eric Foner, “beginning in 1973,

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.050
real wages essentially did not rise for twenty
years.”

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.720
[1]
Americans got to experience the joy of two

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:56.120
years of Gerald Ford before poor Jimmy Carter
had a chance to fail at improving the economy.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:00.240
The only president never to have been elected
even to the vice presidency, Gerald Ford was

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:04.850
so insignificant to American history that
we already replaced him on the chalkboard.

00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:09.060
One of Ford’s first acts was to pardon Nixon
making him immune from prosecution for obstruction

00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:10.060
of justice.

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:14.490
That very unpopular decision probably made
it impossible for Ford to win in 1976.

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:19.889
Coincidentally, WIN was the only memorable
domestic program that Ford proposed.

00:06:19.889 --> 00:06:25.400
It stood for Whip Inflation Now and it was
basically a plea for Americans to be better

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.530
shoppers, spend less, and wear WIN buttons.

00:06:27.530 --> 00:06:31.070
Thirty-five years later Charlie Sheen would
turn winning into an incredibly successful

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.110
social media campaign, but sadly at the time
there was no Twitter.

00:06:34.110 --> 00:06:40.229
Inflation did drop, but unemployment went
up, especially during the recession of 1974-75

00:06:40.229 --> 00:06:41.449
where it topped 9%.

00:06:41.449 --> 00:06:46.130
Now, Ford would have liked to cut taxes and
reduce government regulation, but the Democratic

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:47.290
Congress wouldn’t let him.

00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:50.990
So that’s Ford, probably best known today
as the first president to be satirized on

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:52.020
Saturday Night Live.

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:55.240
Then, in 1976, we got a new president: Jimmy
Carter.

00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:59.290
Now Jimmy Carter is generally considered by
historians to have been a failure as president.

00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.440
Although, he is often seen as a really good
ex-president.

00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.090
He tried to fight the inflation part of stagflation,
but to do it he acted in some rather un-New

00:07:08.090 --> 00:07:09.539
Deal Democrat ways.

00:07:09.539 --> 00:07:13.919
He cut government spending, deregulated the
trucking and airline industries, and he supported

00:07:13.919 --> 00:07:16.169
the Fed’s decision to raise interest rates.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.900
Oh, it’s time for the mystery document?

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:21.730
The rules here are simple...

00:07:21.730 --> 00:07:24.710
I read the mystery document, I guess the author,
and if I’m wrong I get shocked.

00:07:24.710 --> 00:07:26.110
Alright, let’s see what we’ve got today.

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.740
“I want to speak to you first tonight about
a subject even more serious than energy or

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:31.740
inflation.

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:34.389
I want to talk to you right now about a fundamental
threat to American democracy.

00:07:34.389 --> 00:07:37.350
I do not mean our political and civil liberties.

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:38.699
They will endure.

00:07:38.699 --> 00:07:42.960
And I do not refer to the outward strength
of America, a nation that is at peace tonight

00:07:42.960 --> 00:07:47.240
everywhere in the world, with unmatched economic
power and military might.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:50.569
The threat is nearly invisible in ordinary
ways.

00:07:50.569 --> 00:07:52.770
It is a crisis of confidence.

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:57.569
It is a crisis that strikes at the very heart
and soul and spirit of our national will.

00:07:57.569 --> 00:08:01.759
We can see this crisis in the growing doubt
about the meaning of our own lives and in

00:08:01.759 --> 00:08:04.349
the loss of a unity of purpose for our nation.

00:08:04.349 --> 00:08:08.740
The erosion of our confidence in the future
is threatening to destroy the social and political

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.440
fabric of America.”

00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:14.770
It’s Jimmy Carter’s “Crisis of Confidence”
speech, my favorite speech ever made that

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:17.660
also cost a president 20 points of approval
rating.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:21.940
So Carter says that Americans have lost their
ability to face the future and some of their

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.240
can-do spirit.

00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:27.470
The rest of the speech talks about how Americans’
values are out of whack, how Americans are

00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:30.780
wasteful, and need a new more vibrant approach
to the energy crisis.

00:08:30.780 --> 00:08:34.319
Let me tell you a lesson from history Jimmy
Carter, you don’t get reelected by telling

00:08:34.319 --> 00:08:36.240
Americans how to do more with less.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:40.930
You get reelected by telling Americans, “more,
more, always more, more for you.

00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:41.930
More.

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:42.930
More.

00:08:42.930 --> 00:08:43.930
More.

00:08:43.930 --> 00:08:44.930
I promise.”

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:46.029
The speech ultimately called for a renewal
of spirit, but all people remember is the

00:08:46.029 --> 00:08:50.230
part where Jimmy Carter was criticizing them,
and it’s gone down as a great example of

00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.589
Carter’s political ineptitude.

00:08:51.589 --> 00:08:55.649
Domestically, Carter paid lip-service to liberal
ideas like energy conservation, even installing

00:08:55.649 --> 00:09:00.529
solar panels on the White House, but his bigger
plan to solve the energy crises was investment

00:09:00.529 --> 00:09:01.529
in nuclear power.

00:09:01.529 --> 00:09:05.980
And nuclear power did grow, although never
to the extent we saw in certain European countries,

00:09:05.980 --> 00:09:10.910
partly because of the accident at Three Mile
Island in 1979 when radioactive vapor was

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:11.970
released into the air.

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:17.070
This of course spurred public fears of a nuclear
meltdown and drove a huge anti-nuclear energy

00:09:17.070 --> 00:09:18.070
movement.

00:09:18.070 --> 00:09:19.070
But some of Carter’s more conservative policies
did ultimately have an impact, like his support

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:20.070
for deregulation of the airlines.

00:09:20.070 --> 00:09:21.070
Before airline deregulation, prices were fixed,
so airlines had to compete by offering better

00:09:21.070 --> 00:09:22.070
service.

00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:23.070
Now, of course, flights are much cheaper and
also so much more miserable.

00:09:23.070 --> 00:09:24.070
In many ways, Carter was more important as
a foreign policy president, but as with his

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:25.070
energy initiatives, he’s mostly remembered
for his failures.

00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.079
Aiming to make Human Rights a cornerstone
of America’s foreign policy, Jimmy Carter

00:09:28.079 --> 00:09:33.001
tried to turn away from the Cold War framework
and focus instead on combatting 3rd world

00:09:33.001 --> 00:09:35.889
poverty and reducing the spread of nuclear
weapons.

00:09:35.889 --> 00:09:37.379
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:37.379 --> 00:09:41.850
Carter’s notable changes included cutting
off aid to Argentina during its “Dirty War”

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:46.519
and signing a treaty in 1978 that would transfer
the Panama Canal back to Panama.

00:09:46.519 --> 00:09:49.889
His greatest accomplishment was probably brokering
the Camp David Accords.

00:09:49.889 --> 00:09:54.420
This historic peace agreement between Egypt
and Israel has, as we all know, led to a lasting

00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.879
peace in the Middle East, just kidding, but
it has been a step in the right direction

00:09:57.879 --> 00:09:59.120
and one that’s lasted.

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:03.040
But the U.S. continued to support dictatorial
regimes in Guatemala, the Philippines and

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:04.040
South Korea.

00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:07.910
Carter’s most significant failure in terms
of supporting international bad guys, though,

00:10:07.910 --> 00:10:09.149
is the Shah of Iran.

00:10:09.149 --> 00:10:14.269
Iran had oil and was a major buyer of American
arms, but the Shah was really unpopular and

00:10:14.269 --> 00:10:17.720
our support of him fuelled anti-American sentiments
in Iran.

00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:22.939
Those boiled over in the 1979 Iranian Revolution,
especially after Carter allowed the Shah to

00:10:22.939 --> 00:10:26.890
get cancer treatments in America, which in
turn prompted the storming of the American

00:10:26.890 --> 00:10:30.470
embassy in Tehran and the capture of 53 American
hostages.

00:10:30.470 --> 00:10:35.879
The Iranian hostage crisis lasted 444 days
and although Carter’s secretary of state

00:10:35.879 --> 00:10:40.610
did negotiate their release, it didn’t happen
until the day Carter’s successor Ronald

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:41.619
Reagan was inaugurated.

00:10:41.619 --> 00:10:46.019
The inability to free the hostages and the
botched rescue attempt -- Affleck’s ARGO

00:10:46.019 --> 00:10:49.559
notwithstanding -- added to the impression
that Carter was weak.

00:10:49.559 --> 00:10:54.449
Events in the Middle East also increased Cold
War tensions especially after 1979, when the

00:10:54.449 --> 00:10:56.499
USSR invaded Afghanistan.

00:10:56.499 --> 00:11:00.439
Carter claimed that the invasion of Afghanistan
was the greatest threat to freedom since World

00:11:00.439 --> 00:11:05.139
War II and proclaimed the Carter Doctrine,
which was basically said that the U.S. would

00:11:05.139 --> 00:11:09.689
use force, if necessary, to protect its interests
in the Persian Gulf region.

00:11:09.689 --> 00:11:13.999
In direct response to the Soviets, the U.S.
put an embargo on grain shipments and organized

00:11:13.999 --> 00:11:16.680
the boycott of the 1980 Olympics in Moscow.

00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:18.499
Thanks for another dose of good news Thought
Bubble.

00:11:18.499 --> 00:11:23.440
So despite focusing on Carter, I’ll again
stress that the real story of the 1970s was

00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440
the economy.

00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:28.389
High inflation and high unemployment had monumental
effects in shaping America.

00:11:28.389 --> 00:11:30.879
And no president could have dealt with it
effectively.

00:11:30.879 --> 00:11:33.790
Not Carter, not Gerald Ford, not anyone.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:37.259
The truth is, history isn’t about individuals.

00:11:37.259 --> 00:11:41.680
Oil shocks and inevitable systemic changes
led to the poor economy and that weakened

00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.489
support for New Deal liberalism and increased
the appeal of conservative ideas like lower

00:11:46.489 --> 00:11:49.509
taxes, reduced regulation, and cuts in social
spending.

00:11:49.509 --> 00:11:53.740
All of which, for the record, started under
the Democrat Jimmy Carter, not the Republican

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:54.740
Ronald Reagan.

00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:59.430
More abstractly, the economic crisis of the
1970’s dealt a serious blow to the Keynesian

00:11:59.430 --> 00:12:03.749
consensus that Government action could actually
solve macro-economic problems.

00:12:03.749 --> 00:12:08.330
I mean according to the economic theory that
had prevailed for the previous 50 years, unemployment

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:12.999
and inflation were supposed to be inversely
proportional, the so-called Phillips Curve.

00:12:12.999 --> 00:12:17.199
When that relationship broke down and we had
both high inflation and high unemployment

00:12:17.199 --> 00:12:19.640
it undermined the entire idea of government
intervention.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.839
And that opened the door for a different way
of thinking about economics that emphasized

00:12:23.839 --> 00:12:27.100
the economy as an aggregate of individual
economic decisions.

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:30.769
Now that might sound like a small thing, but
whether you think of individual choices or

00:12:30.769 --> 00:12:36.350
governmental policies really make economies
work or not work turns out to be pretty freaking

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:37.350
important.

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:41.009
And this has come to really shape the contemporary
American political landscape especially when

00:12:41.009 --> 00:12:42.639
it comes to taxes.

00:12:42.639 --> 00:12:44.359
Which we’ll talk about more next week.
