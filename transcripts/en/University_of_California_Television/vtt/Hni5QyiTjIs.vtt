00:00:00.433 --> 00:00:02.674
(rushing wind)

00:00:02.674 --> 00:00:05.339
- [Narrator] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.922
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:11.111 --> 00:00:14.611
(upbeat electronic music)

00:00:44.133 --> 00:00:46.443
- And in turn my pleasure
to introduce the second

00:00:46.443 --> 00:00:50.241
of the Hitchcock lectures by
Professor Chikashi Toyoshima

00:00:50.241 --> 00:00:52.533
from the University of Tokyo.

00:00:52.533 --> 00:00:54.861
Toyoshima's group published
the first structure

00:00:54.861 --> 00:00:57.361
of the calcium ATPase in 2000.

00:00:58.617 --> 00:01:01.693
It's a large and unwieldy membrane protein

00:01:01.693 --> 00:01:04.081
and determining the first structures

00:01:04.081 --> 00:01:08.771
were both conceptional and
technical tour de force.

00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:11.990
His group has subsequently
determined structures of the pump

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:16.700
in many stages of the
handling of calcium and ATP.

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.542
And from those structures Toyoshima

00:01:18.542 --> 00:01:20.567
has been able to visualize,

00:01:20.567 --> 00:01:23.190
for the first time in any system,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:25.845
a process of active transport.

00:01:25.845 --> 00:01:27.711
That's what he showed
us briefly at the end

00:01:27.711 --> 00:01:29.452
of yesterday's lecture

00:01:29.452 --> 00:01:32.165
and will tell us about in depth today.

00:01:32.165 --> 00:01:34.220
Please join me in welcoming him.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.720
(crowd claps)

00:01:39.524 --> 00:01:44.149
- So today I'd like to tell
you about the calcium pump

00:01:44.149 --> 00:01:46.031
in much more detail.

00:01:46.031 --> 00:01:49.781
So, just for summarizing
yesterday's lecture,

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.546
so this is a kind of design constellation

00:01:56.546 --> 00:01:59.564
of the calcium ATPase calcium pump.

00:01:59.564 --> 00:02:01.939
So it's ATP powered pump,

00:02:01.939 --> 00:02:06.091
and it has a very high
efficiency of energy usage.

00:02:06.091 --> 00:02:08.408
And specific to calcium.

00:02:08.408 --> 00:02:11.780
So that means it must have mechanism

00:02:11.780 --> 00:02:14.999
for rejecting, for example, sodium ions.

00:02:14.999 --> 00:02:17.999
And it must have at least two gates,

00:02:19.853 --> 00:02:24.686
cytoplasmic and lumenal gates
in the transmembrane region.

00:02:28.023 --> 00:02:32.053
It must have a mechanism that correlates

00:02:32.053 --> 00:02:34.785
the chemical reaction that takes place

00:02:34.785 --> 00:02:36.468
in the cytoplasmic region

00:02:36.468 --> 00:02:40.042
to gating of the
transmembrane ion pathway.

00:02:40.042 --> 00:02:44.542
And I show you that the
chemical reaction occurs here.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:49.025
The actual binding site is located here.

00:02:49.025 --> 00:02:51.452
And the gating occurs here.

00:02:51.452 --> 00:02:52.635
And there.

00:02:52.635 --> 00:02:55.377
And there must be a mechanism to correlate

00:02:55.377 --> 00:03:00.294
that kind of small chemical
reaction to ion pathway gating.

00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:05.793
It's a very long distance in transmission.

00:03:07.332 --> 00:03:11.044
Intramolecular transmission is similar.

00:03:11.044 --> 00:03:14.098
It's about 50 angstroms away.

00:03:14.098 --> 00:03:18.265
I have to explain the
terminology of today's talk.

00:03:21.621 --> 00:03:25.954
Essentially, we say the
active transport is achieved

00:03:28.248 --> 00:03:31.248
by two confirmations of this enzyme.

00:03:34.231 --> 00:03:38.856
So the E1 form it has
high affinity to calcium.

00:03:38.856 --> 00:03:42.582
And E2 form, it has low
affinity to calcium.

00:03:42.582 --> 00:03:46.062
So, the basic idea is that you have to

00:03:46.062 --> 00:03:49.355
catch the calcium in the cytoplasm.

00:03:49.355 --> 00:03:53.105
And then it occlude
these bound calcium ions.

00:03:56.733 --> 00:03:59.400
And then open another gate here.

00:04:01.912 --> 00:04:03.973
It's called lumenal gate.

00:04:03.973 --> 00:04:07.223
And by changing the affinity to calcium

00:04:09.122 --> 00:04:13.039
to a very low affinity,
it release the calcium.

00:04:15.965 --> 00:04:19.548
So the basic idea is
the change of affinity

00:04:20.813 --> 00:04:22.600
of transmembrane binding site

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.131
from a high affinity to low affinity.

00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:26.464
Then release it,

00:04:27.789 --> 00:04:31.789
the enzyme sort of achieve
the active transport.

00:04:35.821 --> 00:04:40.238
During the reaction cycle,
the gamma phosphate of ATP

00:04:43.389 --> 00:04:46.889
actually transfers first to enzyme itself.

00:04:48.500 --> 00:04:51.167
So it is a phosphorylated state.

00:04:52.187 --> 00:04:57.020
To stand for phosphorylated
state we use the term P state.

00:05:01.932 --> 00:05:05.810
So E1P state means it has
high affinity to calcium

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:07.893
and it's phosphorylated.

00:05:10.389 --> 00:05:13.889
And when that happens, the phosphorylation

00:05:16.078 --> 00:05:18.172
also takes place in the two state,

00:05:18.172 --> 00:05:19.839
and please remember,

00:05:20.724 --> 00:05:24.141
only this state the lumenal gate is open.

00:05:25.763 --> 00:05:30.750
To sort of understand this
kind of mechanism in detail

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.993
we have to crystallize the structures.

00:05:33.993 --> 00:05:36.580
The key of the crystallization

00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:40.830
is you have to fix the
protein in one confirmation.

00:05:46.194 --> 00:05:49.001
So, in a way, you need inhibitors.

00:05:49.001 --> 00:05:52.225
And this case, the calcium
itself works as inhibitors.

00:05:52.225 --> 00:05:55.475
And here, we use the ATP analog AMPPCP.

00:05:58.698 --> 00:06:01.781
And that's the phosphorylation state.

00:06:03.167 --> 00:06:05.417
We have aluminium fluoride,

00:06:06.271 --> 00:06:07.467
magnesium fluoride,

00:06:07.467 --> 00:06:09.289
and beryl fluoride.

00:06:09.289 --> 00:06:14.206
So, its fluorine complex act
as a good phosphate in analog.

00:06:20.115 --> 00:06:23.698
That work was actually
done in this campus.

00:06:26.931 --> 00:06:29.014
So, to stabilize E2 form,

00:06:30.454 --> 00:06:33.818
so in this case, nothing
really stabilize it,

00:06:33.818 --> 00:06:38.401
in the native form, then I
have to add some inhibitors.

00:06:39.774 --> 00:06:42.343
The most famous one thapsigargin,

00:06:42.343 --> 00:06:43.785
or benzohydroquinone,

00:06:43.785 --> 00:06:47.493
or cycopiazonic acid, something like that.

00:06:47.493 --> 00:06:52.493
So far, we got these crystals
at relatively high resolution

00:06:52.904 --> 00:06:55.753
for the membrane proteins.

00:06:55.753 --> 00:06:59.086
The best one is 2.1 angstrom resolution.

00:07:00.691 --> 00:07:05.691
All of them (mumbles), I
can tell you the structures

00:07:06.754 --> 00:07:09.610
better than 3 angstrom resolution.

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.195
Another point I should make,

00:07:11.195 --> 00:07:15.112
is to make these crystals
I have to add a lipid

00:07:18.018 --> 00:07:20.685
to mimic the native environment.

00:07:21.871 --> 00:07:25.075
So the crystal actually like this.

00:07:25.075 --> 00:07:28.658
So it's stacks of
two-dimensional crystals.

00:07:29.910 --> 00:07:33.367
I showed this picture yesterday.

00:07:33.367 --> 00:07:37.065
So this is a electron microscopy picture

00:07:37.065 --> 00:07:40.482
of a cross-section of one of the crystal.

00:07:43.062 --> 00:07:47.729
In the magnified view you see
the little areas going up,

00:07:52.452 --> 00:07:55.702
going like this, and make sort of loops.

00:07:55.702 --> 00:08:00.035
And even this area, you see
a very funny lipid loops

00:08:02.191 --> 00:08:05.546
sticking out from the crystalline layers.

00:08:05.546 --> 00:08:10.379
So it is curious that we have
crystals in which the ATPase

00:08:13.866 --> 00:08:17.215
is in the lipid-like environment.

00:08:17.215 --> 00:08:19.715
So this is status of February.

00:08:20.641 --> 00:08:24.308
Before I started the
project I could imagine

00:08:25.233 --> 00:08:28.650
that we may be able to get eight crystals

00:08:30.043 --> 00:08:31.551
of different stages.

00:08:31.551 --> 00:08:36.551
And so far we have succeeded
in, how many, seven of them.

00:08:36.973 --> 00:08:40.973
We don't have this one
for E1P state structures.

00:08:46.202 --> 00:08:50.606
But we know that these
three are very much the same

00:08:50.606 --> 00:08:52.644
from limited proteolysis study.

00:08:52.644 --> 00:08:57.063
And we can say that there
is no big domain movement.

00:08:57.063 --> 00:09:01.211
So mostly I use this one
for representing this one.

00:09:01.211 --> 00:09:05.321
So this one is aluminium
fluoride bound form.

00:09:05.321 --> 00:09:08.700
So it's a transition state analog.

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:10.617
And ADP is still bound.

00:09:12.398 --> 00:09:15.815
And the most recent addition is this one.

00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.757
And I hope you remember

00:09:19.913 --> 00:09:24.320
that only in this state
the lumenal gate is open.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.987
And other state the
lumenal gate are closed.

00:09:29.531 --> 00:09:32.781
So from these seven crystal structures,

00:09:33.773 --> 00:09:37.273
by generating the intermediate structures,

00:09:38.194 --> 00:09:42.921
by simple interpolation, we
could make these kind of movies.

00:09:42.921 --> 00:09:46.963
So the calcium now get
into the binding site.

00:09:46.963 --> 00:09:50.714
And the ATP comes in, and
phosphorylation takes place.

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.417
And the calcium get out.

00:09:53.417 --> 00:09:55.009
That kind of things.

00:09:55.009 --> 00:09:57.237
Of course, it's too quick,

00:09:57.237 --> 00:10:00.260
and even I cannot explain you in time.

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:04.510
So I'd like to tell you
the mechanism step-by-step.

00:10:06.612 --> 00:10:10.529
And also, these kind of
movies not perfect one.

00:10:12.597 --> 00:10:15.043
Because we generate intermediate states

00:10:15.043 --> 00:10:17.118
by simple interpolation.

00:10:17.118 --> 00:10:20.687
Some funny things you can perhaps see.

00:10:20.687 --> 00:10:24.854
But from these we can
address important questions.

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:30.958
The movement we saw so
large and complicated.

00:10:30.958 --> 00:10:34.619
Why such large and complicated
movements are necessary?

00:10:34.619 --> 00:10:36.657
And what does ATP do?

00:10:36.657 --> 00:10:38.498
And what does phosphorylation do?

00:10:38.498 --> 00:10:41.748
We can address these kind of questions.

00:10:46.665 --> 00:10:51.007
This is sort of false
structure we got in year 2000.

00:10:51.007 --> 00:10:53.284
So this is a calcium bound form.

00:10:53.284 --> 00:10:55.617
And I showed this yesterday.

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.571
This is a transmembrane region.

00:11:00.571 --> 00:11:03.904
It consists of 10 transmembrane helices.

00:11:07.119 --> 00:11:09.493
If you look at the cytoplasmic regions,

00:11:09.493 --> 00:11:13.160
it consists of three
very separated domains.

00:11:14.490 --> 00:11:19.490
This one, at the center, it's
called phosphorylatioN-domain.

00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:21.558
So it's P-domain.

00:11:21.558 --> 00:11:24.419
And because these phosphorylation residue,

00:11:24.419 --> 00:11:27.588
in this case it's structure is aspartate.

00:11:27.588 --> 00:11:31.505
It's a kind of bacterial
type phosphorylations.

00:11:35.472 --> 00:11:37.554
This domain locates here.

00:11:37.554 --> 00:11:40.210
And N-domain is closed because

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.460
the adenine molecule of ATP binds here.

00:11:47.689 --> 00:11:51.789
And A-domain was sort
of very ambiguous domain

00:11:51.789 --> 00:11:56.789
at the beginning, but it turned
out to be a kind of actuator

00:11:58.323 --> 00:12:00.841
of a transmembrane gating mechanism.

00:12:00.841 --> 00:12:03.591
So I made perhaps correct naming.

00:12:05.643 --> 00:12:07.133
So this is A-domain.

00:12:07.133 --> 00:12:12.133
So calcium, as you see here,
it's located side-by-side,

00:12:12.224 --> 00:12:17.057
although we know that calcium
binding strictly sequential.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:21.925
Also, I'd like to stress that the A-domain

00:12:21.925 --> 00:12:24.155
has sort of three links.

00:12:24.155 --> 00:12:26.479
All of them look like flexible links

00:12:26.479 --> 00:12:28.896
to the transmembrane regions.

00:12:32.023 --> 00:12:34.035
Is it possible to write down?

00:12:34.035 --> 00:12:35.500
Perhaps not.

00:12:35.500 --> 00:12:38.663
Well, it's difficult to see perhaps.

00:12:38.663 --> 00:12:41.914
This is the cytoplasmic region.

00:12:41.914 --> 00:12:44.247
And this one is a N-domained

00:12:47.753 --> 00:12:49.524
nucleotide binding domain.

00:12:49.524 --> 00:12:52.864
And this center one is the
P-domain, the yellow one.

00:12:52.864 --> 00:12:55.066
And this blue one, you can't almost see.

00:12:55.066 --> 00:12:56.816
But it's a A-domains.

00:12:59.470 --> 00:13:03.244
Well I hope you see that the
yellow helix is very long.

00:13:03.244 --> 00:13:06.084
And starting from this lumenal end surface

00:13:06.084 --> 00:13:10.064
to very near the phosphorylation site,

00:13:10.064 --> 00:13:12.897
to the end of the P-domain I mean.

00:13:14.992 --> 00:13:19.595
Another thing I'd like to
stress is that they are linked

00:13:19.595 --> 00:13:22.678
by a very, look like, flexible links.

00:13:26.113 --> 00:13:29.780
But from you, perhaps,
you can't really see.

00:13:31.035 --> 00:13:33.504
I'm sorry about this.

00:13:33.504 --> 00:13:37.537
Okay, so let's go into a bit of detail.

00:13:37.537 --> 00:13:39.490
So this is a calcium binding site.

00:13:39.490 --> 00:13:43.364
And now you are looking
at the cytoplasmic side,

00:13:43.364 --> 00:13:45.888
approximately normal to the membrane.

00:13:45.888 --> 00:13:50.221
So this one, the spheres
represent the calcium ions.

00:13:53.237 --> 00:13:55.764
The two calcium ions, as I mentioned,

00:13:55.764 --> 00:13:58.205
are located side-by-side.

00:13:58.205 --> 00:14:02.906
And by looking at these
calcium, you perhaps realize

00:14:02.906 --> 00:14:05.602
that their environment
are quite different.

00:14:05.602 --> 00:14:07.483
The binding mode is different.

00:14:07.483 --> 00:14:11.233
The site one is made by
all side chain atoms,

00:14:15.407 --> 00:14:18.266
side chain oxygen atoms, like this one,

00:14:18.266 --> 00:14:19.099
this one,

00:14:19.099 --> 00:14:19.932
this one,

00:14:19.932 --> 00:14:20.765
this one,

00:14:20.765 --> 00:14:21.598
this one.

00:14:21.598 --> 00:14:23.389
And two water molecules.

00:14:23.389 --> 00:14:24.468
As I mentioned yesterday,

00:14:24.468 --> 00:14:27.619
that the calcium likes
seven coordinations.

00:14:27.619 --> 00:14:31.465
And certainly this case
the coordination is seven.

00:14:31.465 --> 00:14:34.382
So seven oxygen atoms make binding.

00:14:35.337 --> 00:14:37.341
And you look at the site two.

00:14:37.341 --> 00:14:39.376
It's completely different.

00:14:39.376 --> 00:14:43.626
The site two are formed by
main chain oxygen atoms.

00:14:47.039 --> 00:14:48.036
Like this one,

00:14:48.036 --> 00:14:48.959
that one,

00:14:48.959 --> 00:14:50.771
and that one.

00:14:50.771 --> 00:14:53.438
And the glutamate 309, this one,

00:14:55.726 --> 00:14:57.768
it has it's carboxyl group,

00:14:57.768 --> 00:15:02.518
so it has two oxygen atoms,
sort of capping this calcium.

00:15:05.471 --> 00:15:08.872
So the site two calcium
almost sitting on the end

00:15:08.872 --> 00:15:10.621
of a alpha helix.

00:15:10.621 --> 00:15:14.621
And this glutamate sort
of capping this calcium.

00:15:16.392 --> 00:15:21.173
If you are familiar with
the calcium binding protein,

00:15:21.173 --> 00:15:24.643
that's quite reminiscent of EF hand motif

00:15:24.643 --> 00:15:25.875
I mentioned yesterday.

00:15:25.875 --> 00:15:29.375
So the most frequent calcium binding motif

00:15:32.594 --> 00:15:35.278
found in soluble calcium binding proteins.

00:15:35.278 --> 00:15:37.728
But it's very much the same here.

00:15:37.728 --> 00:15:39.231
And also I would like to mention

00:15:39.231 --> 00:15:43.481
that only one amino acid
residue, it's termed D800,

00:15:45.499 --> 00:15:49.269
sort of bridging the two calcium ions.

00:15:49.269 --> 00:15:54.269
And from site mutagenesis studies
we know that this site one

00:15:54.566 --> 00:15:57.149
is a first calcium ion to bind.

00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.417
And then the second one bind.

00:16:01.969 --> 00:16:04.886
And that explains the cooperativity

00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:08.824
of calcium binding pretty well.

00:16:08.824 --> 00:16:11.491
Because when the calcium get in,

00:16:13.673 --> 00:16:16.703
perhaps site two is not properly formed,

00:16:16.703 --> 00:16:20.737
and so if it's properly formed
it must be trapped here,

00:16:20.737 --> 00:16:24.154
but it is presumably not properly formed,

00:16:26.936 --> 00:16:31.353
so the calcium can get
through this site to site one.

00:16:34.288 --> 00:16:38.205
Then this perhaps this
D800 positioned properly

00:16:39.218 --> 00:16:42.635
and allows the second calcium ion to bind

00:16:43.618 --> 00:16:45.736
with the high affinity.

00:16:45.736 --> 00:16:48.069
And the reason why this site

00:16:50.434 --> 00:16:52.828
is the first calcium ion binding site

00:16:52.828 --> 00:16:55.298
is explained like this.

00:16:55.298 --> 00:16:57.574
So if you remove, say,

00:16:57.574 --> 00:17:01.308
just one oxygen atom from
this one or that one,

00:17:01.308 --> 00:17:05.702
you completely lose the
calcium binding ability.

00:17:05.702 --> 00:17:09.696
But if you remove this one or that one,

00:17:09.696 --> 00:17:13.089
you still have 50% of
calcium binding ability.

00:17:13.089 --> 00:17:14.995
So the easiest explanation is that

00:17:14.995 --> 00:17:18.162
this is the first calcium ion to bind.

00:17:19.072 --> 00:17:21.897
Because if the first one cannot bind,

00:17:21.897 --> 00:17:24.381
the second one cannot bind either.

00:17:24.381 --> 00:17:27.831
But even you destroy this second one,

00:17:27.831 --> 00:17:30.025
the first one is still fine,

00:17:30.025 --> 00:17:33.358
if you have a 50% calcium affinity.

00:17:38.132 --> 00:17:39.211
The next one,

00:17:39.211 --> 00:17:43.544
I should look at the so-called
E1 to E2 equilibrium,

00:17:47.096 --> 00:17:51.346
or more rigorous, the E1
calcium to E2 equilibrium.

00:17:55.666 --> 00:17:57.749
For this, you add calcium

00:18:01.336 --> 00:18:05.534
or some curating reagent
to remove calcium.

00:18:05.534 --> 00:18:08.373
So this is a equilibrium process.

00:18:08.373 --> 00:18:11.061
No sort of energy other than

00:18:11.061 --> 00:18:14.205
the sum of energies in the (mumbles).

00:18:14.205 --> 00:18:17.955
But still you see such
a really big movement.

00:18:20.191 --> 00:18:21.256
And you can consider this as sort of

00:18:21.256 --> 00:18:23.839
a shortcut of active transport.

00:18:24.746 --> 00:18:28.329
So E1 calcium form is
a starting conditions

00:18:30.533 --> 00:18:34.327
and the E2 state you can consider that

00:18:34.327 --> 00:18:36.493
after the calcium binding.

00:18:36.493 --> 00:18:40.289
So there are several things clearly occur.

00:18:40.289 --> 00:18:43.848
One important thing is that this open,

00:18:43.848 --> 00:18:48.181
sort of headpiece, closes
in the absence of calcium.

00:18:49.951 --> 00:18:51.701
Also this long helix,

00:18:53.370 --> 00:18:54.620
this green one,

00:18:55.493 --> 00:18:58.092
it's called M5 helix as I mentioned,

00:18:58.092 --> 00:19:02.342
so this very long helix
sort of bows this direction

00:19:04.017 --> 00:19:06.443
in the absence of calcium.

00:19:06.443 --> 00:19:10.809
And the third thing I should
mention, that this movement,

00:19:10.809 --> 00:19:13.726
right, this cyan Helix is M4 helix.

00:19:14.994 --> 00:19:17.942
As I showed in this previous slide,

00:19:17.942 --> 00:19:21.359
that M4 helix forms a very important part

00:19:24.811 --> 00:19:27.469
of a calcium binding site.

00:19:27.469 --> 00:19:30.302
It uses a main chain oxygen atoms.

00:19:32.149 --> 00:19:37.078
So if it really moves, then
perhaps this calcium also moves.

00:19:37.078 --> 00:19:40.828
What we see here is that
this M4 helix moves.

00:19:43.618 --> 00:19:44.451
Like this.

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:53.228
I have to introduce this
numbering of the helices,

00:19:53.228 --> 00:19:57.508
because otherwise you can't
refer to the structure well.

00:19:57.508 --> 00:20:00.034
So the left hand side

00:20:00.034 --> 00:20:03.284
is the more simplified representations.

00:20:06.395 --> 00:20:10.145
I used cylinder instead
of ribbons or spirals

00:20:11.307 --> 00:20:14.592
to represent the alpha helices.

00:20:14.592 --> 00:20:19.592
What we see here is this M4
helix, M4L, it move like this.

00:20:20.069 --> 00:20:22.303
And it is easier to see the movement,

00:20:22.303 --> 00:20:24.087
perhaps, from the side.

00:20:24.087 --> 00:20:26.670
So M4 helix is here, like this.

00:20:29.745 --> 00:20:33.515
The calcium is located there,
in the calcium bound form,

00:20:33.515 --> 00:20:36.182
and must be released, like this.

00:20:37.493 --> 00:20:40.259
So for we see here is a kind
of piston-like movement.

00:20:40.259 --> 00:20:43.342
So it's really like mechanical pumps.

00:20:47.609 --> 00:20:49.526
I mentioned two things,

00:20:51.079 --> 00:20:54.496
big differences in the E1 to E2 movement.

00:20:57.055 --> 00:21:01.722
And so M5 bent rather larger
towards M1 is located here.

00:21:04.441 --> 00:21:06.717
So, it's bent like this.

00:21:06.717 --> 00:21:07.550
Right?

00:21:08.433 --> 00:21:10.109
Here you see this part.

00:21:10.109 --> 00:21:11.745
M5 sort of bends.

00:21:11.745 --> 00:21:12.838
Like this.

00:21:12.838 --> 00:21:16.742
And M3 and M4 move together
to the lumenal side

00:21:16.742 --> 00:21:18.992
by one turn of alpha helix.

00:21:20.369 --> 00:21:22.284
I did not mention this one,

00:21:22.284 --> 00:21:25.201
but M6 rotates by 90 degrees or so.

00:21:27.767 --> 00:21:30.154
By doing this, what we see here

00:21:30.154 --> 00:21:33.148
is the number of oxygen atoms

00:21:33.148 --> 00:21:37.912
that possibly contribute to
make calcium binding site.

00:21:37.912 --> 00:21:40.705
In the calcium bound form,

00:21:40.705 --> 00:21:45.040
five oxygen atoms from
amino acid side chains,

00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:48.132
and two water molecules form site one.

00:21:48.132 --> 00:21:53.041
And in the site two, four
side chain's oxygen atoms

00:21:53.041 --> 00:21:57.432
and three main chain
oxygen atoms form site two.

00:21:57.432 --> 00:22:01.932
As I mentioned, by the
mutagenesis experiment removing

00:22:03.122 --> 00:22:06.455
only one of this side chain oxygen atoms

00:22:07.438 --> 00:22:12.131
would completely destroy
the calcium binding ability.

00:22:12.131 --> 00:22:15.973
And, in this configuration, it certainly

00:22:15.973 --> 00:22:19.723
has only four oxygen
atom can make this site,

00:22:22.807 --> 00:22:26.742
if the number of water molecules the same.

00:22:26.742 --> 00:22:29.575
And that applies to site two also.

00:22:31.008 --> 00:22:35.425
So that nicely explains
lower affinity of this state.

00:22:37.753 --> 00:22:40.442
So the mechanism is here.

00:22:40.442 --> 00:22:43.740
As I mentioned, we need a catch state,

00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:44.852
occlude state,

00:22:44.852 --> 00:22:46.647
and release state.

00:22:46.647 --> 00:22:51.143
And this one is correspond
to E1 to calcium form.

00:22:51.143 --> 00:22:54.327
And this one correspond to the E2 form.

00:22:54.327 --> 00:22:58.494
And very old Tanford model
is something like this.

00:22:59.344 --> 00:23:02.844
So it perhaps requires a very small change

00:23:04.583 --> 00:23:06.170
of calcium coordination.

00:23:06.170 --> 00:23:11.170
(mumbles) Catch the calcium
some charge residues

00:23:11.441 --> 00:23:13.774
will be arranged so it makes

00:23:15.187 --> 00:23:18.431
a very nice coordination of calcium.

00:23:18.431 --> 00:23:19.890
For when it's released,

00:23:19.890 --> 00:23:23.404
perhaps it requires just a small change.

00:23:23.404 --> 00:23:25.737
So maybe this helix twisted,

00:23:27.817 --> 00:23:28.892
or inclined,

00:23:28.892 --> 00:23:32.642
so that the coordination
geometry become poor

00:23:34.001 --> 00:23:37.407
and will decrease the affinity.

00:23:37.407 --> 00:23:39.824
And it's not really the case.

00:23:40.722 --> 00:23:44.305
And this is my model,
I thought, initially.

00:23:45.182 --> 00:23:48.751
Because part of the helix actually broken.

00:23:48.751 --> 00:23:52.897
It may be possible to
sort of extend this part.

00:23:52.897 --> 00:23:56.652
And then the calcium
coordination will be worse,

00:23:56.652 --> 00:23:57.964
and will be released.

00:23:57.964 --> 00:24:01.509
But, in fact, we found it's not like this.

00:24:01.509 --> 00:24:05.676
It moves, like that, right,
like mechanical pumps.

00:24:08.425 --> 00:24:11.175
And so, let's see, how it's made.

00:24:13.216 --> 00:24:17.799
And the three things I
mentioned, how they are related.

00:24:20.596 --> 00:24:25.596
One of the key thing is this
M5 helix, it's a very long one,

00:24:26.461 --> 00:24:28.628
and so it bends like that.

00:24:29.890 --> 00:24:32.786
It is sort of integrated
into the P-domain,

00:24:32.786 --> 00:24:35.028
we are now looking at the P-domain here.

00:24:35.028 --> 00:24:39.376
So the phosphorylation
is this aspartate 351,

00:24:39.376 --> 00:24:41.022
is located here.

00:24:41.022 --> 00:24:44.772
This M5 helix, be a long
transmembrane helix,

00:24:45.731 --> 00:24:49.148
has a (mumbles) in here.

00:24:50.806 --> 00:24:52.831
And also M4 helix,

00:24:52.831 --> 00:24:56.121
that's the helix really
makes the site two,

00:24:56.121 --> 00:24:57.845
calcium binding site,

00:24:57.845 --> 00:25:00.678
it's sort of connected to M5 helix

00:25:03.045 --> 00:25:07.010
by forming this kind of sheet structures.

00:25:07.010 --> 00:25:09.605
So something happens here,

00:25:09.605 --> 00:25:14.503
will be transmitted to these
transmembrane helices easily.

00:25:14.503 --> 00:25:17.609
And also, something
happens somewhere there,

00:25:17.609 --> 00:25:22.168
will be transmitted to
phosphorylation site also.

00:25:22.168 --> 00:25:24.501
So, it's a mechanical links.

00:25:28.206 --> 00:25:30.984
This one compares to two states,

00:25:30.984 --> 00:25:34.420
and to calcium bound
form is always violet,

00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:37.087
and the E2 form is always green.

00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.849
Like this.

00:25:40.849 --> 00:25:42.956
By superimposing these two structure

00:25:42.956 --> 00:25:45.539
we see that M5 bends like that,

00:25:46.408 --> 00:25:49.991
and M4 moves together
and then the M4 kicks

00:25:51.184 --> 00:25:53.684
the M2 helix in the one state.

00:25:56.790 --> 00:25:58.722
So it's a violet ones.

00:25:58.722 --> 00:26:01.419
The M2 helix cannot stay there.

00:26:01.419 --> 00:26:03.618
So that has to move like this.

00:26:03.618 --> 00:26:06.035
And that also moves the M1 helix.

00:26:06.987 --> 00:26:11.084
So it's a kind of molecular
dominoes takes place here.

00:26:11.084 --> 00:26:14.034
So it's a very large
global confirmation change.

00:26:14.034 --> 00:26:17.684
But important thing is
what you really need

00:26:17.684 --> 00:26:21.267
is changing the curvature
of this M5 helix.

00:26:22.443 --> 00:26:26.605
And also, it is possible to
explain the downward movement

00:26:26.605 --> 00:26:31.605
of M4 helix by very simple
geometric causing and (mumbles).

00:26:31.811 --> 00:26:35.561
And M4 and M5 helix
integrated into P-domain.

00:26:37.683 --> 00:26:40.011
So if the M5 helix moves

00:26:40.011 --> 00:26:43.112
from this position to that position,

00:26:43.112 --> 00:26:45.836
then the P-domain inclines.

00:26:45.836 --> 00:26:48.102
That pushes the M4 helix.

00:26:48.102 --> 00:26:51.356
This is actually the
mechanism it really used.

00:26:51.356 --> 00:26:56.356
And I hope you remember that
the inclination of the P-domain

00:26:56.857 --> 00:26:59.524
will move the M4 helix downward.

00:27:01.355 --> 00:27:04.355
That is the key movement, really is.

00:27:06.539 --> 00:27:08.973
So the next thing is
one of the main events,

00:27:08.973 --> 00:27:10.306
the ATP binding.

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.068
Of course this is something wrong here,

00:27:16.068 --> 00:27:19.623
because this inner domain start to move

00:27:19.623 --> 00:27:21.873
to just catch the ATP here.

00:27:24.204 --> 00:27:28.954
In the real case, the ATP
binds much earlier in the step.

00:27:31.037 --> 00:27:34.092
That's sort of an artifact
of the interpolation.

00:27:34.092 --> 00:27:34.925
Anyway.

00:27:37.128 --> 00:27:40.357
I want to stress is that the three things.

00:27:40.357 --> 00:27:44.274
Here, the open headpiece
becomes compact again.

00:27:45.988 --> 00:27:50.405
And the second thing is that
this blue one, M1 helix,

00:27:52.477 --> 00:27:55.644
is sort of put upwards by ATP binding.

00:27:56.721 --> 00:28:00.446
And this part, the top
part, sort of bends.

00:28:00.446 --> 00:28:01.962
Like that.

00:28:01.962 --> 00:28:05.962
And it is easier to see
this movement from side.

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:09.843
So the binding of ATP,

00:28:13.520 --> 00:28:16.937
this blue ones, so-called M1 to M2 helix,

00:28:18.038 --> 00:28:20.375
brought up into the cytoplasm

00:28:20.375 --> 00:28:23.214
and form the kind of V-shaped structures.

00:28:23.214 --> 00:28:26.547
And this part, I call M1 dash, M1 prime,

00:28:27.611 --> 00:28:29.861
becomes a very short helix,

00:28:33.932 --> 00:28:37.849
it slides on the top of
the membrane's surface.

00:28:39.645 --> 00:28:43.561
And it's clearly facilitated
by the A-domain movement.

00:28:43.561 --> 00:28:47.293
And if you look at the A-domain like this,

00:28:47.293 --> 00:28:51.486
this is the A2 helix, sort
of rotates, like that.

00:28:51.486 --> 00:28:56.486
So the A-domain is actually
tilts by the ATP binding.

00:28:56.545 --> 00:28:57.378
Like this.

00:28:59.625 --> 00:29:01.895
I think on more thing I should stress

00:29:01.895 --> 00:29:04.478
that the movement of this link.

00:29:06.404 --> 00:29:10.702
By tilting of this A-domain
it pulls these things;

00:29:10.702 --> 00:29:12.452
M1, M2, and M3 links.

00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.239
So these flexible links

00:29:15.239 --> 00:29:18.395
are all pulled up and perhaps strained.

00:29:18.395 --> 00:29:21.895
So in the chemical reaction putting strain

00:29:23.325 --> 00:29:26.575
causes the reaction to go through fast.

00:29:29.024 --> 00:29:31.441
So this very similar maneuver

00:29:34.123 --> 00:29:37.873
is used for making the
reaction forward here.

00:29:40.097 --> 00:29:44.319
I did not mention that
just the carbon binding

00:29:44.319 --> 00:29:48.221
of calcium does not close
this cytoplasmic gate.

00:29:48.221 --> 00:29:52.388
And this site two calcium
is actually exchangeable

00:29:53.642 --> 00:29:56.892
with the calcium ions in the cytoplasm.

00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:01.420
This spheres represent the water molecules

00:30:03.069 --> 00:30:04.819
bound in the crystal.

00:30:05.856 --> 00:30:09.523
It means that the water
can reach this part,

00:30:11.006 --> 00:30:13.589
and also that means the calcium

00:30:15.551 --> 00:30:18.281
perhaps be able to come this point.

00:30:18.281 --> 00:30:21.826
So this is a wider view of this area.

00:30:21.826 --> 00:30:24.727
And you see two calcium ions here.

00:30:24.727 --> 00:30:29.041
And you see these red spheres
represent water molecules

00:30:29.041 --> 00:30:31.124
around this binding site.

00:30:32.054 --> 00:30:36.804
So this one is the glutamate
that's capping this calcium.

00:30:37.951 --> 00:30:42.618
So there is plenty of space
for the glutamate side chain

00:30:45.197 --> 00:30:48.148
to change it's confirmation.

00:30:48.148 --> 00:30:51.927
So it may change confirmation
this way to that way,

00:30:51.927 --> 00:30:54.140
then this calcium may be able

00:30:54.140 --> 00:30:59.088
to get out from here to there
and the new one comes in.

00:30:59.088 --> 00:31:02.995
So it means that the cytoplasmic gate

00:31:02.995 --> 00:31:05.802
is not really closed in this state.

00:31:05.802 --> 00:31:08.385
But here, we see in this state,

00:31:12.482 --> 00:31:16.732
this space is occupied by
another large side chain,

00:31:18.902 --> 00:31:21.431
a hydrophobic residues.

00:31:21.431 --> 00:31:25.175
Here you find leucines and leucines.

00:31:25.175 --> 00:31:30.043
And it has no space for
this glutamate side chain

00:31:30.043 --> 00:31:32.376
to change it's confirmation.

00:31:33.579 --> 00:31:36.963
And to do that the enzyme actually moves

00:31:36.963 --> 00:31:38.589
the whole helix here.

00:31:38.589 --> 00:31:43.172
Not just one residue, the
ATPase moves the whole helix.

00:31:45.034 --> 00:31:49.508
That's the one we saw
in the previous movies.

00:31:49.508 --> 00:31:53.341
So it's now clear that
calcium cannot get out.

00:31:55.373 --> 00:31:58.816
So this must be the
mechanism of occlusion.

00:31:58.816 --> 00:32:00.566
So the gate mechanism

00:32:01.457 --> 00:32:05.904
is the gate closure of
the cytoplasmic gate.

00:32:05.904 --> 00:32:10.654
This movement is certainly
facilitated by binding of ATP.

00:32:11.665 --> 00:32:16.498
Cause actually we used this
nonhydrolyzable analog of ATP.

00:32:18.006 --> 00:32:19.423
So-called AMPPCP.

00:32:21.025 --> 00:32:23.649
So usually oxygen must be here,

00:32:23.649 --> 00:32:26.816
but in this one it's carbon atom here.

00:32:28.302 --> 00:32:30.885
And it's located near the hinge

00:32:32.519 --> 00:32:35.230
between the the N-domain and the P-domain

00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:38.063
and cross-links these two domains.

00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.037
This is a more detailed view.

00:32:46.092 --> 00:32:48.342
The point here is that ATP,

00:32:52.167 --> 00:32:56.412
the adine ending binds to this green one,

00:32:56.412 --> 00:32:58.124
it's the N-domain,

00:32:58.124 --> 00:33:01.272
and the phosphate region
binds to P-domain.

00:33:01.272 --> 00:33:03.719
So it's a cross-link really.

00:33:03.719 --> 00:33:07.219
So if the ATP gamma phosphate transferred,

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.690
so this bond is cleaved,

00:33:12.234 --> 00:33:15.901
then there is perhaps
no need for the enzyme

00:33:18.192 --> 00:33:20.359
to keep this confirmation.

00:33:21.241 --> 00:33:24.074
So the enzyme it will be released.

00:33:25.959 --> 00:33:29.376
So, in a way, this ATP analog cross-links

00:33:32.816 --> 00:33:35.733
the P and the N-domains so that the

00:33:37.481 --> 00:33:39.564
(coughs)

00:33:45.558 --> 00:33:46.978
phosphorylate transfer

00:33:46.978 --> 00:33:48.578
can be able to take place.

00:33:48.578 --> 00:33:53.411
And also important is this
magnesium ion, metal ions here.

00:33:55.092 --> 00:33:57.425
Why important is shown here.

00:33:59.852 --> 00:34:04.770
This, again, is a difficult
picture, busy picture.

00:34:04.770 --> 00:34:09.770
Because the P-domain of the
two states are superimposed.

00:34:10.214 --> 00:34:14.122
E1 calcium form is shown always in violet.

00:34:14.122 --> 00:34:17.289
So this yellow one is the AMPPCP form.

00:34:18.736 --> 00:34:22.681
We see here is that the
binding of nucleotide

00:34:22.681 --> 00:34:25.264
and magnesium bends the domain.

00:34:28.096 --> 00:34:30.954
You see the orientation of this M4

00:34:30.954 --> 00:34:33.204
as a P6 helix and P7 helix.

00:34:34.344 --> 00:34:36.214
It bends like that.

00:34:36.214 --> 00:34:40.614
For it's important is A-domain
and P-domain interacts

00:34:40.614 --> 00:34:42.233
only this point!

00:34:42.233 --> 00:34:44.983
So one of the end of the A-domain

00:34:46.146 --> 00:34:48.990
is sitting almost on this helix.

00:34:48.990 --> 00:34:51.440
So it changes a bit, only slightly.

00:34:51.440 --> 00:34:54.028
Maybe 20 degrees or so.

00:34:54.028 --> 00:34:58.695
But because this change occurs
near this pivoting point,

00:35:01.064 --> 00:35:05.152
some change somewhere
here must be very large.

00:35:05.152 --> 00:35:07.402
And that's really the case.

00:35:10.263 --> 00:35:14.513
In the previous movie I
show that by binding of ATP

00:35:15.902 --> 00:35:17.992
the A-domain rotates like that.

00:35:17.992 --> 00:35:21.408
But the change here is very small.

00:35:21.408 --> 00:35:25.491
Just 20 degrees or so in
bending of the P-domain.

00:35:26.616 --> 00:35:30.129
That brings the A-domain so much.

00:35:30.129 --> 00:35:35.087
The angle is at 20 degrees
or something like that,

00:35:35.087 --> 00:35:37.534
but the movement is very large.

00:35:37.534 --> 00:35:40.155
It's large enough for bringing up

00:35:40.155 --> 00:35:42.905
this M2 and M5 helices like this.

00:35:48.674 --> 00:35:53.674
So the next step is a real main
event, the calcium release.

00:35:53.959 --> 00:35:58.209
And that happens here is
110 degrees or so rotation

00:35:59.111 --> 00:36:00.297
of the A-domain.

00:36:00.297 --> 00:36:03.832
This time it's horizontal rotations.

00:36:03.832 --> 00:36:06.999
See here the A2 helix moves like that.

00:36:09.794 --> 00:36:13.794
And what happens is that
rotation is transmitted

00:36:14.726 --> 00:36:19.059
to this V-shaped structure
formed by M1, M2 helices.

00:36:20.441 --> 00:36:23.524
And that this M1 helix sort of pushes

00:36:24.665 --> 00:36:26.665
this M4 helix like that.

00:36:28.895 --> 00:36:32.379
As I mentioned, that the key movement

00:36:32.379 --> 00:36:37.046
is the downward movement of
M4 and M3 helices like this.

00:36:39.261 --> 00:36:43.344
That we saw in the E1
calcium to E2 equilibriums.

00:36:44.471 --> 00:36:47.999
So what happens here is
that the A-domain rotates,

00:36:47.999 --> 00:36:51.323
it moves this V-shaped structure,

00:36:51.323 --> 00:36:54.240
and that moves this M1, M3 helices.

00:36:55.424 --> 00:36:57.007
And how it is done?

00:37:00.456 --> 00:37:04.359
So this is just a top
view of this rotation.

00:37:04.359 --> 00:37:07.995
So the start point here, E1P state.

00:37:07.995 --> 00:37:12.245
So you look at this cylinder
representing A2 helix.

00:37:13.534 --> 00:37:16.117
It's original position is here.

00:37:17.087 --> 00:37:21.587
And after it becomes E2P
state it comes this position.

00:37:24.215 --> 00:37:26.934
So very large alterations.

00:37:26.934 --> 00:37:29.934
And one more thing I should mention,

00:37:31.376 --> 00:37:34.376
in E1P state, both gates are closed.

00:37:35.548 --> 00:37:39.623
And this state, cytoplasmic gate is closed

00:37:39.623 --> 00:37:42.033
but lumenal gate is opened.

00:37:42.033 --> 00:37:45.783
And, this state, both
gates are closed again.

00:37:47.478 --> 00:37:49.506
So I mentioned this one.

00:37:49.506 --> 00:37:53.350
The lumenal gate is
closed in this E1P analog.

00:37:53.350 --> 00:37:56.267
And this one, it's barium fluoride,

00:37:58.358 --> 00:38:01.291
and E2-P ground state analogs.

00:38:01.291 --> 00:38:03.942
And this one, aluminum fluoride,

00:38:03.942 --> 00:38:05.929
and it's transition state analog.

00:38:05.929 --> 00:38:10.229
I show you some detail
in few minutes later.

00:38:10.229 --> 00:38:14.229
So by rotating this one,
0 degree to 90 degrees,

00:38:15.404 --> 00:38:19.376
what we see here is that
this V-shaped structure

00:38:19.376 --> 00:38:22.739
moves from this position to that positions

00:38:22.739 --> 00:38:26.239
and pushes this M3 and M4 helix like that.

00:38:29.289 --> 00:38:33.122
And that causes the
opening of a lumenal gate.

00:38:34.288 --> 00:38:38.538
And how this movement and
this movement are related

00:38:44.184 --> 00:38:46.351
is an important questions.

00:38:48.366 --> 00:38:51.545
Let's think about this kind of movement.

00:38:51.545 --> 00:38:53.630
And also is important

00:38:53.630 --> 00:38:56.362
is the actually shape of this P-domain.

00:38:56.362 --> 00:39:00.103
P-domain, you see it's ridge-like shape.

00:39:00.103 --> 00:39:02.538
Has a ridge-like shape, right?

00:39:02.538 --> 00:39:07.288
And the A-domain moving on
the top surface of this ridge.

00:39:10.413 --> 00:39:13.663
So what happens is in the E1P positions

00:39:15.617 --> 00:39:18.933
this A-domain is located here.

00:39:18.933 --> 00:39:22.183
And in the E2P form it come. like this.

00:39:24.866 --> 00:39:28.366
So if the P-domain is fixed, and M-domain,

00:39:29.762 --> 00:39:32.595
M1 helix for example, is moveable,

00:39:34.231 --> 00:39:37.576
then by moving this it simply lift

00:39:37.576 --> 00:39:39.743
the transmembrane helices.

00:39:41.755 --> 00:39:45.122
But if this transmembrane helices

00:39:45.122 --> 00:39:47.568
want to stay in the membrane

00:39:47.568 --> 00:39:50.985
and P-domain can change it's inclination.

00:39:51.934 --> 00:39:56.673
What happens is that the
P-domain comes this positions.

00:39:56.673 --> 00:40:00.256
Keeping this M1 helix
at the same position.

00:40:02.381 --> 00:40:07.131
And, for I mentioned, is in
the E1, E2, P, A2 equilibrium

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:12.150
the P-domain inclines
and pushes M4 downward.

00:40:13.671 --> 00:40:15.671
So that's the key event.

00:40:17.233 --> 00:40:20.946
And here, certainly we
see that kind of movement.

00:40:20.946 --> 00:40:24.113
And what causes such downward movement

00:40:27.614 --> 00:40:30.364
is that the M1 helix want to stay

00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.090
in the main transmembrane region.

00:40:36.713 --> 00:40:40.630
Maybe I go back to this
movie to see you again.

00:40:41.516 --> 00:40:45.766
Here you see these things,
green one the P-domains.

00:40:47.273 --> 00:40:51.190
You see it inclines to
move toward the membrane

00:40:53.052 --> 00:40:56.885
when the A-domain moves
in to this directions.

00:40:57.944 --> 00:41:02.611
So this is a mechanism that
opening of the lumenal gate.

00:41:08.895 --> 00:41:13.812
So A-domain rotates, it moves
this V-shaped structure also,

00:41:16.870 --> 00:41:19.472
(coughs)

00:41:19.472 --> 00:41:21.519
and at the same time,

00:41:21.519 --> 00:41:24.806
because this A-domain rotates like this

00:41:24.806 --> 00:41:28.223
and M1, M2 helices stays in the membrane,

00:41:29.080 --> 00:41:32.097
so it inclines the P-domain

00:41:32.097 --> 00:41:35.430
and that causes this M4 helix downwards.

00:41:37.003 --> 00:41:39.873
And pushes down the M4 helix.

00:41:39.873 --> 00:41:43.402
And that make (mumbles) lumenal gating.

00:41:43.402 --> 00:41:47.151
If you look at from the
side, that really happens.

00:41:47.151 --> 00:41:50.151
Cause the A-domain rotates this way,

00:41:52.069 --> 00:41:54.902
at the same time P-domain inclines

00:41:56.921 --> 00:42:00.110
because M1 or M2 helices stay there

00:42:00.110 --> 00:42:05.110
and the M5 helix certainly
allows that kind of inclinations.

00:42:06.408 --> 00:42:09.075
So that's the M5 helix designed.

00:42:13.583 --> 00:42:16.000
So this is just a open state.

00:42:18.263 --> 00:42:20.261
This is occluded stages.

00:42:20.261 --> 00:42:24.631
You can not have space to
water or calcium to get in.

00:42:24.631 --> 00:42:27.552
But here you see a rather large opening

00:42:27.552 --> 00:42:30.582
and calcium can get released

00:42:30.582 --> 00:42:32.082
through this gate.

00:42:33.423 --> 00:42:37.256
The second step, this
does from here to there.

00:42:41.148 --> 00:42:42.648
What happens here,

00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.433
you now compare this E2
barium fluoride structure

00:42:48.433 --> 00:42:51.183
to aluminium fluoride structures.

00:42:52.245 --> 00:42:55.578
What you see here is M2 helix unwinding.

00:42:57.631 --> 00:43:01.548
And M2 helix is continuous
helix in this state.

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:06.030
But here it's broken into two pieces.

00:43:09.616 --> 00:43:13.783
Because a helix is a very
long, winding structure,

00:43:17.990 --> 00:43:22.157
so it needs many residue
to span certain distance.

00:43:23.491 --> 00:43:26.530
But if you extend like this,

00:43:26.530 --> 00:43:30.377
it easily allows five
angstroms of downward movement.

00:43:30.377 --> 00:43:33.530
So that actually happen here.

00:43:33.530 --> 00:43:35.780
So you see that M1 position

00:43:37.278 --> 00:43:40.951
of this end of the V-shaped structure

00:43:40.951 --> 00:43:44.778
changes from this position
to that positions.

00:43:44.778 --> 00:43:48.572
And that causes a
downward movement M1 helix

00:43:48.572 --> 00:43:51.459
from this position to that positions.

00:43:51.459 --> 00:43:55.959
So it presses this M4 helix
to close the lumenal gate.

00:43:57.504 --> 00:44:02.499
So the mechanism here is that
the M2 helix has a switch.

00:44:02.499 --> 00:44:07.499
The helix to coil transition
(mumbles) occurs here.

00:44:08.459 --> 00:44:11.709
And that allows this V-shaped structure

00:44:14.074 --> 00:44:16.907
to go downward and close the gate.

00:44:18.592 --> 00:44:22.842
At the same time this
rotation does one more thing,

00:44:25.100 --> 00:44:27.589
or two more things actually.

00:44:27.589 --> 00:44:32.465
By doing this very large
rotation, what we now see

00:44:32.465 --> 00:44:36.132
is what happens around
phosphorylation site.

00:44:40.236 --> 00:44:43.403
This is a magnified view of this area.

00:44:47.911 --> 00:44:50.450
(coughs)

00:44:50.450 --> 00:44:53.117
By 110 degree rotation rotations

00:44:55.488 --> 00:44:56.516
the one loop,

00:44:56.516 --> 00:44:59.599
so-called TGES loop, I write in here,

00:45:00.511 --> 00:45:05.261
comes into this positions and
occupies where the ADP was.

00:45:07.519 --> 00:45:11.746
So it's clearly preventing
the rebinding of ADP,

00:45:11.746 --> 00:45:14.829
and for the ADP to be able to rebind,

00:45:17.617 --> 00:45:19.347
whole structure has to be moved.

00:45:19.347 --> 00:45:22.410
That must be a quite big movement.

00:45:22.410 --> 00:45:25.910
So the backward reaction here is prevented

00:45:27.861 --> 00:45:29.944
by physically bringing in

00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:38.788
and prevents the backward reaction.

00:45:38.788 --> 00:45:43.251
So that seems to be the way
this enzyme really works.

00:45:43.251 --> 00:45:48.251
There are two ways for enzyme
to facilitate the catalysis.

00:45:48.789 --> 00:45:53.622
One way is to, of course,
accelerate the forward reaction.

00:45:54.775 --> 00:45:59.775
The other possibility is to
prevent the backward reaction.

00:46:00.075 --> 00:46:02.575
And here we see several places

00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:07.843
that mechanism for preventing
backward reactions.

00:46:09.549 --> 00:46:13.882
Anyway, by going from this
position to that position

00:46:15.469 --> 00:46:18.386
also we see an electrostatic catch.

00:46:19.536 --> 00:46:21.661
And the P-domain and the A-domain

00:46:21.661 --> 00:46:24.715
forms interface in this region.

00:46:24.715 --> 00:46:27.867
We see a charge residues arginine,

00:46:27.867 --> 00:46:31.268
and on the other side it's aspartate

00:46:31.268 --> 00:46:35.359
and the other place is also this arginine,

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:38.541
and here it use main chain atom,

00:46:38.541 --> 00:46:41.374
but we see an electrostatic catch.

00:46:44.407 --> 00:46:48.240
So electrostatic is a
long-range interactions.

00:46:49.284 --> 00:46:52.602
It may be able to catch the A-domain

00:46:52.602 --> 00:46:56.852
moving in this direction,
and just stabilize there.

00:46:58.028 --> 00:47:01.469
So, many thing actually occur here.

00:47:01.469 --> 00:47:04.219
And this movement must be related

00:47:05.481 --> 00:47:08.398
to hydrolysis of aspartylphosphate.

00:47:11.299 --> 00:47:15.716
What I wanted to show is
that aspartate, where it is,

00:47:18.439 --> 00:47:19.272
near here.

00:47:21.685 --> 00:47:23.268
This is aspart 351,

00:47:24.222 --> 00:47:28.639
and forms a triangular things
pointing downwards here

00:47:29.823 --> 00:47:34.293
because this is a sort
of covalent bond form.

00:47:34.293 --> 00:47:37.876
The first oxygen atom
of phosphate is here.

00:47:41.696 --> 00:47:44.196
And this has a magnesium here.

00:47:47.332 --> 00:47:48.597
And this is a ground state.

00:47:48.597 --> 00:47:53.060
In the transition state the
movement must be very small

00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:55.435
because that's just the inversion

00:47:55.435 --> 00:47:57.081
of these triangular things.

00:47:57.081 --> 00:47:59.998
And in this transition state analog

00:48:02.433 --> 00:48:04.183
it's a planar things.

00:48:06.406 --> 00:48:10.239
You see here, it's a
planar phosphate analogs.

00:48:12.001 --> 00:48:13.753
So this is the transition state,

00:48:13.753 --> 00:48:18.064
and certainly we now see
these water molecules

00:48:18.064 --> 00:48:21.017
in the perfect position to attack

00:48:21.017 --> 00:48:23.434
the transition state analogs.

00:48:28.337 --> 00:48:31.087
And we also see a glutamate here.

00:48:33.926 --> 00:48:38.926
It's glutamate can work as
a general base and/or acid

00:48:40.859 --> 00:48:43.609
and activate this water molecule.

00:48:46.304 --> 00:48:51.304
And in this state this glutamate
is pointing sort of inward

00:48:51.373 --> 00:48:56.373
of this loop and can not make
this kind of interactions.

00:48:56.553 --> 00:49:00.273
So the things move in here is very small,

00:49:00.273 --> 00:49:04.752
but we now see a water
molecule comes in here.

00:49:04.752 --> 00:49:08.169
That force causes the change of movement,

00:49:11.155 --> 00:49:14.073
the change of this loop, it's a TGES loop.

00:49:14.073 --> 00:49:16.907
And TGES loop is one of
the signature sequence

00:49:16.907 --> 00:49:18.574
of a P-type ATPases.

00:49:19.452 --> 00:49:24.119
It's very important for
hydrolysis of aspartylphosphate.

00:49:25.519 --> 00:49:26.857
These Ys here,

00:49:26.857 --> 00:49:31.397
the glutamate (mumbles)
activates water molecules,

00:49:31.397 --> 00:49:35.480
and also stabilizes state
in these confirmations.

00:49:39.483 --> 00:49:42.400
So this is just a space fill model.

00:49:44.088 --> 00:49:48.421
And in the E2P ground state
it's completely occupied

00:49:49.389 --> 00:49:54.389
by protein and magnesium and
this case it's beryl fluoride

00:49:54.890 --> 00:49:55.723
on here.

00:49:56.730 --> 00:50:01.313
So no space for the water to
get in to make hydrolysis.

00:50:02.947 --> 00:50:07.114
So the transition state
we see this water molecule

00:50:11.826 --> 00:50:16.205
can attack this transition
state analogous phosphate

00:50:16.205 --> 00:50:19.955
just enough for just
one water molecule here.

00:50:21.693 --> 00:50:24.923
So, this is a rather small change,

00:50:24.923 --> 00:50:28.840
but it's really functionally
has a big meaning.

00:50:29.799 --> 00:50:32.466
And now I show you a animations.

00:50:34.252 --> 00:50:36.328
I hope you see it now a bit better.

00:50:36.328 --> 00:50:39.161
So this is of ground state of E2P.

00:50:40.807 --> 00:50:44.557
The tilt, squiggle,
means of transition state

00:50:45.870 --> 00:50:49.287
and dot P-I stands for the product state.

00:50:50.697 --> 00:50:53.981
And for is important
is in the ground state

00:50:53.981 --> 00:50:56.894
the triangular things point downwards,

00:50:56.894 --> 00:50:59.375
and transition states become planar,

00:50:59.375 --> 00:51:03.458
and then the production
state it's got like this.

00:51:04.911 --> 00:51:09.407
So we now see a chemical
reaction of aspartylphosphate

00:51:09.407 --> 00:51:12.574
in (mumbles) details.

00:51:13.615 --> 00:51:18.198
So the movement of water
molecule moves the TGES group,

00:51:20.262 --> 00:51:23.695
that causes the hydrolysis and also causes

00:51:23.695 --> 00:51:27.134
the movement of adenine farther.

00:51:27.134 --> 00:51:32.051
It correlates the hydrolysis
of aspartate to gating things.

00:51:38.453 --> 00:51:40.870
So this is E2 PT2 transition.

00:51:43.051 --> 00:51:47.322
So you see the gate is closed
by release of phosphate.

00:51:47.322 --> 00:51:49.655
So the summary is like this.

00:51:50.494 --> 00:51:53.083
The A-domain is the actuator
of the transmembrane gates.

00:51:53.083 --> 00:51:55.312
Its position and orientation

00:51:55.312 --> 00:51:57.196
are regulated by domain interface.

00:51:57.196 --> 00:52:00.279
And it's really the gating mechanism.

00:52:02.946 --> 00:52:05.343
And ATP, phosphate, magnesium, and calcium

00:52:05.343 --> 00:52:08.674
are main modifiers of the interface.

00:52:08.674 --> 00:52:10.523
But it doesn't tell you

00:52:10.523 --> 00:52:14.773
why such large and complicated
movements necessary.

00:52:15.857 --> 00:52:17.998
What does ATP do?

00:52:17.998 --> 00:52:20.276
It's relatively easy to understand.

00:52:20.276 --> 00:52:23.247
The ATP is a cleavable cross-linker

00:52:23.247 --> 00:52:25.914
that bridges the N and P-domain.

00:52:27.947 --> 00:52:30.535
It tilts the A-domain and places strain

00:52:30.535 --> 00:52:32.535
on the A-domain M3 link.

00:52:33.682 --> 00:52:35.665
I maybe forgot to mention that this

00:52:35.665 --> 00:52:39.603
is really the driving force
of the A-domain rotation.

00:52:39.603 --> 00:52:44.270
Because if you cut this link
by proteolysis no rotation,

00:52:45.758 --> 00:52:48.508
or no ATP hydrolysis takes place.

00:52:50.135 --> 00:52:54.945
But this seems to need
only the structure of ATP.

00:52:54.945 --> 00:52:58.598
And where the energy
of ATP hydrolysis goes?

00:52:58.598 --> 00:53:01.778
That's a quite interesting
and important question

00:53:01.778 --> 00:53:05.028
I give you as a subject to think about.

00:53:07.519 --> 00:53:09.173
And the reason why such large

00:53:09.173 --> 00:53:12.714
and complicated main movements
are necessary is here.

00:53:12.714 --> 00:53:16.813
So the answer is perhaps
ion pumps fluctuate so much

00:53:16.813 --> 00:53:21.722
by thermal energy yet you
have to utilize it effectively

00:53:21.722 --> 00:53:23.873
for transporting ions.

00:53:23.873 --> 00:53:25.887
To explain this to you

00:53:25.887 --> 00:53:30.058
I show you molecular dynamic simulations.

00:53:30.058 --> 00:53:32.292
And this is a real system.

00:53:32.292 --> 00:53:35.459
So the one calcium ATPase molecule put

00:53:36.485 --> 00:53:39.192
in the explicit lipid bi-layers,

00:53:39.192 --> 00:53:41.692
and water molecules, and salt.

00:53:43.095 --> 00:53:47.319
And this one is 150
millimolar potassium chloride.

00:53:47.319 --> 00:53:49.819
And the blue one is potassium,

00:53:51.715 --> 00:53:55.162
and the red ones is perhaps chloride.

00:53:55.162 --> 00:53:58.563
But you see even at 150 millimolar

00:53:58.563 --> 00:54:01.480
the number of ions is fairly small.

00:54:02.962 --> 00:54:07.784
So if it's a 10 millimolar
of even micromolar calcium,

00:54:07.784 --> 00:54:12.413
the chances for getting this
enzyme must be very small.

00:54:12.413 --> 00:54:14.413
But still, it functions.

00:54:15.614 --> 00:54:20.064
And the computation power we
have is something like this.

00:54:20.064 --> 00:54:22.944
And because this is a huge system,

00:54:22.944 --> 00:54:25.408
although I have a quite good ones,

00:54:25.408 --> 00:54:28.658
and I can make 5 parallel computations,

00:54:30.936 --> 00:54:34.186
I can simulate 0.4 nanoseconds per day.

00:54:36.848 --> 00:54:40.181
Well, you remember from yesterday's talk

00:54:41.091 --> 00:54:44.424
the calcium ATPase needs 30 milliseconds

00:54:45.368 --> 00:54:47.905
to go through one cycle.

00:54:47.905 --> 00:54:52.255
So if you divide that
number (laughs) by this one

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:55.506
you can't sort of imagine
that the calculation

00:54:55.506 --> 00:54:58.373
will be done within
your lifetime. (laughs)

00:54:58.373 --> 00:55:01.128
But still it gives you a very good insight

00:55:01.128 --> 00:55:03.033
on how it really works.

00:55:03.033 --> 00:55:05.736
So this is the 30 nanosecond simulations.

00:55:05.736 --> 00:55:09.736
And this tiny violet
spheres represent calciums.

00:55:10.722 --> 00:55:13.472
So you see so much movement here.

00:55:14.669 --> 00:55:18.316
Also these domains fluctuate so much.

00:55:18.316 --> 00:55:21.057
And in the next one I show you

00:55:21.057 --> 00:55:24.998
a magnified view of that
area, calcium binding region.

00:55:24.998 --> 00:55:27.831
You see it's very shaking so much.

00:55:28.843 --> 00:55:32.174
And these small, small red spheres

00:55:32.174 --> 00:55:33.866
represent water molecules

00:55:33.866 --> 00:55:37.783
that attack this site
two calcium continuously.

00:55:40.031 --> 00:55:43.127
Only this glutamate side chain prevent

00:55:43.127 --> 00:55:46.794
the water molecule will
attack this calcium.

00:55:49.191 --> 00:55:50.441
As I mentioned,

00:55:53.406 --> 00:55:56.751
in this state the cytoplasmic
gate is not really closed.

00:55:56.751 --> 00:56:00.821
So if this glutamate side
chain change it's confirmation,

00:56:00.821 --> 00:56:01.654
open,

00:56:02.805 --> 00:56:05.606
allows access of water
molecules to this one,

00:56:05.606 --> 00:56:08.939
perhaps whole system allows this calcium

00:56:11.342 --> 00:56:14.691
to pop out and new one to come in.

00:56:14.691 --> 00:56:17.593
So it's quite, perhaps easy to understand.

00:56:17.593 --> 00:56:20.722
So even though the simulation is limited

00:56:20.722 --> 00:56:25.139
you can get a quite good
insight how it really works.

00:56:25.982 --> 00:56:28.732
So this is a taking home message.

00:56:30.878 --> 00:56:35.211
Ion pumps work, oh, English
is wrong, but nevermind.

00:56:37.632 --> 00:56:40.402
Ion pumps work in the
thermally fluctuating world,

00:56:40.402 --> 00:56:42.877
yet they utilize thermal
energy effectively

00:56:42.877 --> 00:56:45.527
for transporting ions.

00:56:45.527 --> 00:56:48.992
And to do that I think it's
quite important to mention

00:56:48.992 --> 00:56:51.325
that they use flexible links

00:56:53.443 --> 00:56:56.764
between the A-domain and
these transmembrane helices.

00:56:56.764 --> 00:56:58.264
And pressed strain

00:56:59.455 --> 00:57:03.543
for driving the movement
to one directions.

00:57:03.543 --> 00:57:05.017
So if it's a flexible link

00:57:05.017 --> 00:57:07.821
perhaps you can not press this

00:57:07.821 --> 00:57:12.154
so that the reactions go
back to the previous state.

00:57:14.946 --> 00:57:18.113
So putting strain on the flexible link

00:57:20.678 --> 00:57:25.678
seems to be the way to prevent
the backward reaction also.

00:57:25.693 --> 00:57:27.991
And also perhaps cooperatively binding

00:57:27.991 --> 00:57:30.324
the nucleotide and magnesium

00:57:32.571 --> 00:57:35.571
also prevent the backward reactions.

00:57:36.840 --> 00:57:40.694
So for the important part it
use the helix-helix contact.

00:57:40.694 --> 00:57:44.065
But for driving to the one directions

00:57:44.065 --> 00:57:48.405
it seems to use the
strains on flexible links.

00:57:48.405 --> 00:57:51.072
So the nature uses same maneuver

00:57:53.709 --> 00:57:56.126
to make the reaction proceed.

00:57:58.194 --> 00:58:01.147
And in the simple chemical reactions

00:58:01.147 --> 00:58:05.356
if the molecule is distorted and strained

00:58:05.356 --> 00:58:09.904
then the chances for this
molecule to break is much higher.

00:58:09.904 --> 00:58:14.321
So it's similar thing is
used for different purposes.

00:58:15.250 --> 00:58:19.167
But in a way I think the
principle is the same.

00:58:20.413 --> 00:58:22.978
So I think I'd like to thank you

00:58:22.978 --> 00:58:26.011
for your attentions and stop here.

00:58:26.011 --> 00:58:31.011
