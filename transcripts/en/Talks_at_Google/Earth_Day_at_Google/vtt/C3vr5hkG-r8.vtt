00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:09.800
&gt;&gt;[Presenter named Boris] Welcome, everybody,
to another Authors at Google talk.

00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:16.080
Today, we have with us author Richard Martin,
whose new book just came out.

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:24.050
Let me actually-- [pause] This is the book,
SuperFuel: Thorium, the Green Energy Source

00:00:24.050 --> 00:00:27.210
for the Future.

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:35.060
We had several speakers at Google already
talk about thorium, but Richard is the author

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:41.050
who actually brought the whole thorium discussion
to the forefront here with his piece in the

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.050
Wired magazine.

00:00:42.050 --> 00:00:45.100
He's been a science writer for many years.

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:52.840
He's also an award-winning journalist and
he is the editorial director of Pike Research,

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:55.019
a leading clean energy firm.

00:00:55.019 --> 00:00:58.390
He lives in Boulder, Colorado, with his wife
and son.

00:00:58.390 --> 00:01:03.910
I just want to introduce to those of you who
haven't heard about thorium much.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:13.659
I think it's-- As you probably know, over
60% of our energy today comes from coal, gas,

00:01:13.659 --> 00:01:14.659
and petroleum.

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:17.530
This is causing a lot of issues.

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:20.520
You've all heard Al Gore's talks.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:25.170
I would like to plug in for those of you who
really think that there's still a debate going

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:32.690
on on CO2 or something to go and look back
at Inez Fung's talk on climate modeling, which

00:01:32.690 --> 00:01:39.100
is also available on Youtube, and which should
convince you that it's really serious stuff.

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:45.700
Thorium as the energy source is an important
gap-step if you're trying to deal with this

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.299
issue seriously.

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.479
Please welcome Richard Martin to share with
us.

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:52.939
[applause]

00:01:52.939 --> 00:02:01.180
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin] Thank you Boris, and thank
you to everyone for coming.

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:02.479
It's been interesting.

00:02:02.479 --> 00:02:07.320
The Wired story on thorium came out at the
end of 2009, so I've been reporting on this

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:11.090
for about 3 years.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:17.390
It's really been interesting to see this movement
that really started out with a committed band

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:24.300
of outsiders really grow to a worldwide wave
in which there are actual businesses raising

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:28.570
actual money and hopefully building and licensing
actual reactors.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:38.220
I am going to give you the final chapter of
the book today, and really start from the

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:44.370
60,000 foot view and zoom in and talk about
what needs to happen to actually make thorium

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:47.940
power reality.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:52.760
We're going to actually start with the Roman
Empire.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:03:01.370
[pause] In 416 AD, a Roman bureaucrat named
Rutilius Namatianus set out from the imperial

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.770
capital to his homeland of Gaul.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.590
He wrote a verse, a long poem, a verse account
of his journey, which was called De Reditu

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:12.950
Suo, which means "Of His Return."

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.120
It gives a very vivid portrait of the empire
in decline.

00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:22.610
It was several decades before the traditional
fall of the Roman Empire.

00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.150
The most remarkable thing about Rutilius'
return was that he traveled by boat.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:32.130
The reason that's remarkable, of course, is
that the Roman Empire was famed for its vast

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.380
network of roads that really connected most
of the known world.

00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:42.310
Here's what he said: "I have chosen the sea
since roads by land, if on the level, are

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.040
flooded by rivers, if on higher ground, are
beset with rocks.

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:52.120
Since Tuscany and since the Aurelian highway,
after suffering the outrages of Goths with

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:57.401
fire or sword can no longer control forest
with homestead or river with bridge, it's

00:03:57.401 --> 00:04:00.190
better to entrust my sails to the wayward
sea."

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:06.260
In other words, by the time of Rutilius' return,
the empire's decline was already inescapable.

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:13.500
Roads had decayed, aqueducts had collapsed,
cities lay in ruin, harbors had silted.

00:04:13.500 --> 00:04:16.030
So why did the Roman Empire fall?

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:21.160
Someone has counted up the number of theories
to explain the fall of Rome.

00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.050
They counted 210 theories, from poisoning
with wine goblets made of lead to moral decay

00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:32.849
to the hiring of mercenaries to replace the
traditional Roman legionaries.

00:04:32.849 --> 00:04:38.420
The one that really interests me here was
outlined by Joseph Tainter in a 1990 book

00:04:38.420 --> 00:04:41.370
called The Collapse of Complex Societies.

00:04:41.370 --> 00:04:47.380
[phone rings in background] It has to do with
what's called "energy return on investment."

00:04:47.380 --> 00:04:52.039
So put simply, the energy required to maintain
the Roman lifestyle, all those monuments,

00:04:52.039 --> 00:04:57.319
games and spectacles, feasts, and central
heated bathhouses, became more and more costly

00:04:57.319 --> 00:04:59.449
as centuries passed.

00:04:59.449 --> 00:05:04.830
Fertile cropland was depleted, and landscapes
were deforested.

00:05:04.830 --> 00:05:09.039
The empire had to import grain from farther
and farther afield.

00:05:09.039 --> 00:05:14.170
Even as the imperial infrastructure, roads,
bridges, aqueducts, grain mills, fortifications,

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:16.460
and so on, fell into disrepair.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:20.150
Remote borders became harder to defend.

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:26.090
The army, the source of Rome's might for a
millennium, went underfed and unmotivated.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.560
By the end, Rome was easy pickings for the
barbarian hoards.

00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:35.150
Here's-- Tainter actually in an interview--
The great problem Rome faced was when they

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.060
would have to incur very high cost just to
maintain the status quo.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:45.340
They had to invest very high amounts in solving
problems that didn't yield a positive return,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:48.860
but instead simply allowed them to maintain
what they already had.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:53.270
I would argue that that's a very succinct
description of the predicament we find ourselves

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:54.960
in today.

00:05:54.960 --> 00:06:00.680
Essentially, imperial Rome fell because it
failed to diversify its energy sources.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.659
Notably, an innovative technology existed
to do just that.

00:06:05.659 --> 00:06:10.060
Rome was the first civilization to develop
all the necessary components for the world's

00:06:10.060 --> 00:06:13.320
first steam engine, but it never built one
for practical use.

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:18.689
In the 1st century AD, a man named Hero of
Alexandria, who was a Greek living under Roman

00:06:18.689 --> 00:06:27.560
rule, described an aelophile, which was named
for Aeolus, the god of wind, which is now

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.189
considered the first device powered by steam.

00:06:31.189 --> 00:06:38.699
It was a water-filled cauldron, that's the
big container you see, heated by a fire, obviously,

00:06:38.699 --> 00:06:42.469
with a pair of tubes projecting upwards from
its lid.

00:06:42.469 --> 00:06:47.909
The tubes supported a metal sphere that spun
on its horizontal axis, with two nozzles or

00:06:47.909 --> 00:06:53.120
tip-jets protruding from it and bent in opposite
directions.

00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:56.270
Expelled through nozzles, steam generated
thrust that spun the ball.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.110
It was considered a marvel of ingenuity, but
something of a parlor trick.

00:07:00.110 --> 00:07:04.419
The Romans never thought to use steam to drive
machines to perform labor.

00:07:04.419 --> 00:07:10.310
Why should they, when slave labor was so cheap
and plentiful?

00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:11.770
Moving forward in time a bit.

00:07:11.770 --> 00:07:17.960
In a great book, The March of Folly, the historian
Barbara Tuchman catalogues a series of critical

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:22.850
turning points at which governments and societies,
trapped in the status quo despite mounting

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:29.590
contrary evidence, failed to leap imaginatively,
to take bold and visionary steps into the

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:33.199
future, and to change the course of events.

00:07:33.199 --> 00:07:38.629
Tuchman called it "pursuit of policy contrary
to self-interest."

00:07:38.629 --> 00:07:45.050
Some of the points that she described were
the start of World War I, Vietnam and the

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:46.180
US, etc.

00:07:46.180 --> 00:07:49.969
I mean the US in Vietnam, etc.

00:07:49.969 --> 00:07:54.620
Here's what Tuchman wrote: "Wooden-headedness
consists of assessing a situation in terms

00:07:54.620 --> 00:08:00.129
of preconceived, fixed notions while ignoring
or rejecting any contrary signs."

00:08:00.129 --> 00:08:05.279
That definition applies perfectly to our current
nuclear power industry, and, I would argue,

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:07.490
the whole power system.

00:08:07.490 --> 00:08:13.169
Ignoring the potential for thorium power in
the 1960s and 1970s, which is what we did,

00:08:13.169 --> 00:08:14.310
was short-sighted.

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.599
To do so now would be folly.

00:08:17.599 --> 00:08:22.949
Going back to Rome for a moment, in the 3rd
century AD, the emperor Diocletian staved

00:08:22.949 --> 00:08:28.060
off the fall of the empire for a few decades
by oppressing the peasantry, raising taxes

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:32.710
to crushing levels, expanding his stifling
bureaucracy, and building up the army through

00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:35.000
the employment of mercenaries.

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.500
Diocletian assessed the situation in terms
of his preconceptions, and it worked, for

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:45.540
a while, but it looks mighty foolish 17 centuries
later.

00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:49.070
Let's talk about nuclear power for a moment.

00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:53.190
Most of you will be familiar with what I'm
about to talk about.

00:08:53.190 --> 00:08:57.910
Nuclear power provides about 20% of electricity
in the US and about the same percentage worldwide.

00:08:57.910 --> 00:09:00.480
In France, it's much higher.

00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.200
It's about 80% in France.

00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:09.260
By many measures, the nuclear power industry
has been successful.

00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.940
Despite some very spectacular accidents, which
I'll talk about in a moment, it has a relatively

00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.500
clean safety record.

00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:21.090
Over the last 10 years, what's happened is
the nuclear power industry has gone through

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:25.940
what they call upbraiding, which basically
means running the reactors at higher power

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:31.090
levels than they were conventionally designed
for.

00:09:31.090 --> 00:09:37.040
They've relicensed existing power plants beyond
their original design life, which, to me,

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.310
doesn't sound like a recipe for sustained
prosperity.

00:09:43.310 --> 00:09:49.650
The other thing about nuclear power is that
it's stagnant in terms of innovation.

00:09:49.650 --> 00:09:57.260
The nuclear regulatory commission just licensed
the first new nuclear plant in the US in 34

00:09:57.260 --> 00:09:58.260
years.

00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:01.350
It's a two-reactor plant in Georgia.

00:10:01.350 --> 00:10:07.760
It's conventional light water uranium reactors,
which is basically 40 year old technology.

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:13.480
If you think about what happens here and at
your company, what's happened over those 4

00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:20.540
decades, it's as if we're all still using
Atari 800 computers from about 1980.

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:26.910
So the nuclear power industry has suffered
from a lack of innovation.

00:10:26.910 --> 00:10:30.841
The other thing that's happened is the people
who are running the nuclear power industry

00:10:30.841 --> 00:10:35.390
are the same people who brought you Three
Mile Island, because what happened was when

00:10:35.390 --> 00:10:40.200
the industry began to really stagnate in the
'80s, people didn't go into it.

00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:41.200
They started going elsewhere.

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.200
They went to Wall Street, they started going
to Silicon Valley, etc.

00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:49.160
So there's a doughnut hole in the middle in
terms of personnel in the industry.

00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:50.160
That's starting to change.

00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:55.820
A lot of young people are starting to go into
the industry again.

00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.690
Nuclear engineering departments are starting
to get full again.

00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:07.830
But something needs to change to really bring
the industry into the 21st century.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:11.830
I would argue that it's thorium.

00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:12.950
Just briefly on thorium.

00:11:12.950 --> 00:11:17.250
I'm going to assume that a lot of you have
heard of thorium power.

00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.290
As Boris mentioned, Kirk Sorensen has been
here.

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:25.280
He's one of the leaders of the thorium revival
in the US.

00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:29.560
Thorium is about 4 times as abundant as uranium.

00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.140
It's about as common as lead.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:37.850
I've heard it said that in India, which by
some measures has the largest resources of

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:42.950
thorium in the world, if you scoop up a handful
of sand on a beach in Mumbai, you've got enough

00:11:42.950 --> 00:11:47.000
thorium in your hand to power the city for
a year.

00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.810
That sounds apocryphal to me, but it does
give you a sense of how common it is and what

00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:55.900
a dense and efficient source of energy it
is.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:01.050
The other thing about thorium is that it's
fertile, it's not fissile.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:05.160
What I mean by that is you can't cram a bunch
of thorium into a small space and create a

00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.820
critical mass and start a spontaneous chain
reaction.

00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:10.890
You have to have an external source of neutrons.

00:12:10.890 --> 00:12:17.310
And what happens when you bombard thorium
with neutrons, it goes through a nuclear decay

00:12:17.310 --> 00:12:23.970
chain and eventually reaches actually an isotope
of uranium, which is U-233.

00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:30.590
The type of uranium that is consumed in nuclear
reactors is actually U-235, which is very

00:12:30.590 --> 00:12:32.030
rare in nature.

00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:39.680
So that's why you have to enrich natural uranium
up to a certain level of U-235 to create a

00:12:39.680 --> 00:12:43.190
substance you can use to run a reactor with.

00:12:43.190 --> 00:12:53.100
If you enrich uranium to about 3 to 5% or
maybe 7% U-235, you've got reactor-grade uranium.

00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:58.010
If you continue and enrich it to 20%, you've
got weapons-grade uranium.

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.940
So that's the drama, the dilemma we see unfolding
in Iran right now.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:07.290
If you have a civilian nuclear power industry
with centrifuges to enrich uranium, it's relatively

00:13:07.290 --> 00:13:09.980
easy to enrich it to weapons-grade.

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:12.530
You don't have to enrich thorium at all.

00:13:12.530 --> 00:13:14.410
You can use naturally occurring thorium.

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:20.530
You do need a small igniter fuel to bombard
the thorium, and it transmutes on its own

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:26.660
and becomes U-233, which is in many ways a
better source of energy than U-235.

00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:33.670
Finally, the nuclear waste issue, which, as
you know, we've totally failed to solve.

00:13:33.670 --> 00:13:39.860
The Obama Administration is in favor of new
nuclear power, but it has essentially killed

00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:42.060
the Yucca Mountain storage facility.

00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:46.840
Those are irreconcilable positions, and we
don't have a solution for nuclear waste right

00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840
now.

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:54.300
So if you use thorium in the right kind of
reactors, which I'm going to describe in a

00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:59.420
minute, they're called liquid fluoride thorium
reactors, not only do they produce much, much

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:06.560
less waste, which is much shorter-lived in
terms of the radiotoxicity, you can also consume

00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:12.800
or process existing waste from conventional
nuclear reactors and burn it down essentially

00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:17.040
into a form that's much easier to store and
much easier to deal with.

00:14:17.040 --> 00:14:23.970
I've had people argue against that, but the
fact is, the way to solve the nuclear waste

00:14:23.970 --> 00:14:31.340
problem is to build liquid fluoride thorium
reactors, which are known as LFTRs.

00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:42.440
There are several other advantages to using
thorium instead of uranium, one of which is

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:43.630
thorium is a distributed resource.

00:14:43.630 --> 00:14:46.660
There will never be a Saudi Arabia of thorium.

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:47.660
It's found everywhere.

00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.690
Everybody has a little, a lot of people have
a lot.

00:14:49.690 --> 00:14:54.861
The US has, the latest estimate, although
these estimates are often revised, is that

00:14:54.861 --> 00:15:00.260
the US has 440,000 tons of uranium resources
in the ground.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:05.780
The other thing is we've got a bunch that
has already been produced for the experiments

00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.389
that went on in the '60s.

00:15:07.389 --> 00:15:09.120
It's sitting in the desert in Nevada.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.950
It's enough to power the US for the next 100
years.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:19.690
The current plan on the part of the DOE is
to downblend that thorium with spent uranium

00:15:19.690 --> 00:15:23.000
fuel and bury it, essentially.

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:30.120
That gives you a sense of how crazy our policy
is right now on nuclear power.

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:34.840
Enacting the same policy that hasn't worked
to date only more forcefully is an accurate

00:15:34.840 --> 00:15:42.120
description of the nuclear industry's strategy,
its so-called "nuclear Renaissance."

00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:47.770
Energy policy is a toxic blend of wooden-headedness,
economic self-interest, scientific ignorance,

00:15:47.770 --> 00:15:50.200
theology, and technological inertia.

00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:56.590
In particular, the nuclear power industry
suffers from technological lock-in, which

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:01.040
I'm sure is a term that all of you are familiar
with: the tendency of established technologies

00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:06.670
to crowd other competing and possibly superior
systems out of the market.

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:11.070
The best known example, of course, is our
friend Microsoft.

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:16.510
Few people would suggest that Windows is the
ideal operating system for a personal computer,

00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:22.240
but Bill Gates is a brilliant and ruthless
businessman, and even today, Windows controls

00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:26.540
something like 90% of the PC market.

00:16:26.540 --> 00:16:32.260
The stagnation of nuclear power technology
has followed similar lines, and it was apparent

00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.500
a long time ago.

00:16:34.500 --> 00:16:40.310
Back in 1990, Robin Cowan, who is a professor
at the University of Strasbourg, wrote, "While

00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:45.070
an appropriate decision at the time, it now
seems that light water reactors" --in other

00:16:45.070 --> 00:16:50.470
words, conventional uranium-based reactors--
"may have been an unfortunate choice."

00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:54.970
One of the most interesting features of this
history is the belief held by many that light

00:16:54.970 --> 00:17:00.160
water is not the best technology, either economically
or technically.

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:04.799
I've talked to a lot of people in nuclear
establishment, as I call it, over the last

00:17:04.799 --> 00:17:06.640
few years.

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:12.340
Just about every one of them, at some point,
has uttered a version of what I think is a

00:17:12.340 --> 00:17:13.500
classic quote.

00:17:13.500 --> 00:17:18.909
This came from a guy named Paul Genoa, who's
a spokesman for the Nuclear Energy Institute,

00:17:18.909 --> 00:17:25.120
which is the DC based trade association, the
lobbying group for the nuclear power industry.

00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:30.080
He was interviewed by the Nashville Tennessean
newspaper in a story about thorium.

00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:31.470
Here's what he said.

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:38.330
He said, "You don't just walk away from the
established technology base, the reactor fleet

00:17:38.330 --> 00:17:45.120
that we have today, and try the new, shiny
toy, even if the new, shiny toy might work

00:17:45.120 --> 00:17:46.120
better."

00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:47.120
Think about that for a minute.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:49.509
Even if it works better.

00:17:49.509 --> 00:17:54.529
Let's talk about risk.

00:17:54.529 --> 00:18:00.630
In September of 2010, a natural gas pipeline
exploded in San Bruno, California, not far

00:18:00.630 --> 00:18:01.750
from here.

00:18:01.750 --> 00:18:04.080
It killed 8 people immediately.

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:06.700
35 houses were leveled.

00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:07.830
Dozens more were damaged.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:14.049
It created a crater, 167 feet long, 26 feet
wide, and 39 feet deep.

00:18:14.049 --> 00:18:18.409
It was like an asteroid the size of a refrigerator
had gouged the Earth.

00:18:18.409 --> 00:18:24.519
When's the last time you saw a headline about
the San Bruno natural gas explosion?

00:18:24.519 --> 00:18:28.029
Natural gas is considered a relatively clean
fuel, right?

00:18:28.029 --> 00:18:31.380
We have a bunch of it, and it's really cheap
right now.

00:18:31.380 --> 00:18:37.480
But that accident was one of a rash of industrial
accidents around fossil fuels that included

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:43.860
the 2006 Sago Mine disaster, which killed
12 people, the collapse of the Kingston Fossil

00:18:43.860 --> 00:18:49.919
Plant in Tennessee in 2008, which resulted
in the largest release of coal ash in US history,

00:18:49.919 --> 00:18:57.200
and the Upper Big Branch coal mine explosion,
which killed 29 miners in April of 2010.

00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.460
The most famous, though, was the April 2010
blast that brought down the Deepwater Horizon

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:08.249
offshore oil rig, killing 11 workers and spilling
206 million gallons of crude oil into the

00:19:08.249 --> 00:19:10.590
Gulf of Mexico.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.710
Other countries have not been immune.

00:19:12.710 --> 00:19:19.480
In July 2010, an oil pipeline exploded at
the Port of Dalian in northeast China, resulting

00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:22.500
in the worst oil spill in Chinese history.

00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:24.230
Now let's talk about Fukushima Dai-ichi.

00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:31.270
I'm going to preface this by saying I am not
dismissing the seriousness of that accident.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:36.910
But if you step back for a minute and think
about the nuclear accident at the Fukushima

00:19:36.910 --> 00:19:41.070
Dai-ichi plant, three people died.

00:19:41.070 --> 00:19:45.460
Two were workers trapped in the turbine hall
of reactor 4, which ironically was the only

00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:50.850
reactor that contained no fuel at the time
of the earthquake and tsunami.

00:19:50.850 --> 00:19:57.539
A third man died at Fukushima Dai-ichi, which
is Dai-ichi's sister plant nearby.

00:19:57.539 --> 00:20:02.690
Again, it will take many decades and billions
of dollars to clean up after the Fukushima

00:20:02.690 --> 00:20:04.740
nuclear accident.

00:20:04.740 --> 00:20:10.169
As you've seen in the headlines recently,
they're now seeing radioactive tuna show up

00:20:10.169 --> 00:20:13.820
off the coast of California, which is worrisome.

00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:18.961
The damage to the national psyche of Japan,
which is a country, of course, it's the only

00:20:18.961 --> 00:20:24.519
country that's had two cities destroyed by
nuclear bombs, and which really has worked

00:20:24.519 --> 00:20:30.520
since World War II to harness the power of
nuclear energy for good.

00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.080
The damage to the national psyche there has
been incalculable.

00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:39.580
And of course, Japan's last reactors have
either shut down or are in the process of

00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:40.580
shutting down.

00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:46.110
But in the context of the wider earthquake
and tsunami, which killed at least 18,000

00:20:46.110 --> 00:20:49.240
people, the nuclear accident was a footnote.

00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:53.299
In comparison with the series of fossil fuel
disasters that I've just described, it hardly

00:20:53.299 --> 00:20:55.539
rates mention.

00:20:55.539 --> 00:21:00.909
Arnold Gundersen is a former nuclear power
executive who served as an expert witness

00:21:00.909 --> 00:21:04.149
in the investigation of the Three Mile Island
accident.

00:21:04.149 --> 00:21:09.840
He's become a loud voice in opposition to
nuclear power.

00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:14.710
He called Fukushima the biggest industrial
catastrophe in the history of mankind.

00:21:14.710 --> 00:21:20.490
So my point is, that gives you an idea of
how distorted our views of nuclear power and

00:21:20.490 --> 00:21:25.809
radioactivity and nuclear accidents really
are.

00:21:25.809 --> 00:21:32.809
Fukushima also highlighted our inability to
accurately calculate risk.

00:21:32.809 --> 00:21:38.730
From its earliest days, the nuclear power
industry has faced a fundamental dichotomy

00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:40.809
around risk.

00:21:40.809 --> 00:21:45.119
The chances of a significant accident in any
single nuclear power plant are very, very

00:21:45.119 --> 00:21:53.619
low, but the theoretically possible consequences
of a runaway accident are almost unimaginable.

00:21:53.619 --> 00:21:59.419
My view is that risk aversion in the nuclear
power industry takes two forms: one is technological,

00:21:59.419 --> 00:22:00.700
one is financial.

00:22:00.700 --> 00:22:08.590
Apart from a relatively small group of scientists
and engineers who I profile in SuperFuel,

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:14.149
most nuclear technologies today are hemmed
in by an incrementalism that eliminates the

00:22:14.149 --> 00:22:17.240
possibility of bold and visionary leaps.

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.350
The Blue Ribbon Commission on America's nuclear
future, which was formed by the Obama Administration

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:30.279
soon after Barack Obama took office, has looked
at various pathways forward for nuclear power

00:22:30.279 --> 00:22:35.539
in the 21st century, including, on that list
is thorium reactors.

00:22:35.539 --> 00:22:39.789
But the chances of getting something licensed
in this country and getting financed and getting

00:22:39.789 --> 00:22:42.169
built are slim.

00:22:42.169 --> 00:22:47.249
Only the smallest and most predictable next
step is safe enough to pursue.

00:22:47.249 --> 00:22:50.490
The perception of danger is too high.

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:53.919
As a result, we're stuck with 1970s technology.

00:22:53.919 --> 00:23:00.240
It's like we're driving Ford Fairlanes that
have been suped up to run at higher rpms and

00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:01.869
have a new pair of whitewalls on them.

00:23:01.869 --> 00:23:05.460
That's our current reactor fleet.

00:23:05.460 --> 00:23:07.980
So here's the real risk, and Boris referred
to this.

00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:09.860
This is one of many charts.

00:23:09.860 --> 00:23:16.100
This basically is various predictions of the
rise in temperature through the end of the

00:23:16.100 --> 00:23:19.129
century in degrees Celsius.

00:23:19.129 --> 00:23:21.409
This is what scares me.

00:23:21.409 --> 00:23:26.640
If you look at the risk of a nuclear power
accident in general, from conventional nuclear

00:23:26.640 --> 00:23:32.950
power, much less from thorium reactors, which
are far safer, versus this risk that we're

00:23:32.950 --> 00:23:34.210
looking at.

00:23:34.210 --> 00:23:36.779
There's no comparison.

00:23:36.779 --> 00:23:40.960
We're hastening the onset of disasters, global
climate change, by continuing to burn fossil

00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.470
fuels.

00:23:42.470 --> 00:23:48.200
Just a word about natural gas: I just wrote
part of a cover package for Fortune magazine

00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:51.259
about the natural gas boom.

00:23:51.259 --> 00:23:52.690
That's a great thing for America.

00:23:52.690 --> 00:23:55.330
$2 natural gas is a great thing.

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:59.919
We're actually exporting natural gas from
the Gulf Coast to western Europe because even

00:23:59.919 --> 00:24:04.970
with the transport costs, which with natural
gas are pretty high, the price, once you get

00:24:04.970 --> 00:24:10.419
it to Brussels or wherever in Europe, it's
still much cheaper.

00:24:10.419 --> 00:24:11.480
That's not going to last.

00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:13.249
That price imbalance is not going to last.

00:24:13.249 --> 00:24:17.750
The natural gas industry is not yet-- the
market is not yet globalized like the oil

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.210
industry is.

00:24:19.210 --> 00:24:21.429
That's going to change.

00:24:21.429 --> 00:24:30.770
Being simply the low-cost provider of cheap
energy is not a pathway to sustain prosperity.

00:24:30.770 --> 00:24:36.080
If we continue on our current path, large
coastal cities could be underwater, millions

00:24:36.080 --> 00:24:40.850
of acres of agricultural land will have turned
to desert, severe drought will be widespread,

00:24:40.850 --> 00:24:45.149
resource wars fought over increasingly scarce
supplies of water and energy will become,

00:24:45.149 --> 00:24:46.360
and so on.

00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:48.690
But again, we have a perceptual problem.

00:24:48.690 --> 00:24:54.720
The prospect of global climate change is abstract
and distant to most Americans.

00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.020
There have been some polls recently that are
staggering.

00:24:59.020 --> 00:25:03.390
Only something like 35% of Americans consider
global climate change a real threat.

00:25:03.390 --> 00:25:08.110
They are a lot less terrifying than the tiny,
but real, risk of nuclear accident, which

00:25:08.110 --> 00:25:12.919
has been of course amply displayed at Chernobyl
and now at Fukushima.

00:25:12.919 --> 00:25:16.409
So we're not good at calculating risk.

00:25:16.409 --> 00:25:23.549
Our inability to calculate risk is multiplied
by what Nassim Nicholas Taleb, in his bestseller

00:25:23.549 --> 00:25:29.000
The Black Swan, called the "false belief that
our tools can measure uncertainty."

00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:35.779
Taleb goes on, "The application of sciences
of uncertainty to real-world problems has

00:25:35.779 --> 00:25:37.999
had ridiculous effects."

00:25:37.999 --> 00:25:42.639
Of course, he was referring mostly to the
financial markets, where the tendency to overlook

00:25:42.639 --> 00:25:48.379
outlying and unlikely possibilities, which
he terms "black swan events," help leads to

00:25:48.379 --> 00:25:51.530
the economic crash of 2008.

00:25:51.530 --> 00:25:55.159
Taleb argues that it's human nature, when
you're planning for the future, not to account

00:25:55.159 --> 00:26:02.100
for highly improbable yet catastrophic disruptions:
the explosion of the space shuttle Columbia,

00:26:02.100 --> 00:26:08.070
for instance, the assassination of JFK, or
the Fukushima tsunami, because our forecasting

00:26:08.070 --> 00:26:13.059
models are ruled by the bell curve of predictability.

00:26:13.059 --> 00:26:15.340
Nuclear power has the opposite problem.

00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:20.260
Nuclear power is one of the few areas of modern
life where the merest possibility of a black

00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:26.509
swan event, another Chernobyl or another Fukushima,
has trapped the entire industry in a net of

00:26:26.509 --> 00:26:29.519
anxiety and caution.

00:26:29.519 --> 00:26:33.690
Nuclear power, as I said, has a reverse black
swan problem.

00:26:33.690 --> 00:26:37.289
To me, it's similar to the so-called war on
terror.

00:26:37.289 --> 00:26:43.000
Since 2001, fears of another terror attack
have poisoned American life and cost America

00:26:43.000 --> 00:26:48.990
billions of dollars in ways both visible,
in terms of long lines at security at airports,

00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:56.720
for instance, and invisible, including the
difficulty of foreigners to come work for

00:26:56.720 --> 00:27:01.179
companies like Google because of visa issues.

00:27:01.179 --> 00:27:05.880
Despite the comparatively clean safety record
of the nuclear power industry, the potential

00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:09.749
of nuclear power, at least in the US, has
been stifled by risks that are almost too

00:27:09.749 --> 00:27:12.799
small to measure.

00:27:12.799 --> 00:27:15.379
There's obvious counterexamples in US history.

00:27:15.379 --> 00:27:20.269
Two of the most obvious are the Manhattan
Project and the Apollo program to land men

00:27:20.269 --> 00:27:22.789
on the moon.

00:27:22.789 --> 00:27:27.500
The similarities in those: both depended on
technologies that did not exist when the programs

00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:28.519
began.

00:27:28.519 --> 00:27:32.950
Both called forth entire new industries based
around those technologies, industries that

00:27:32.950 --> 00:27:40.109
had no obvious everyday benefits or profit
potential before they arose, and both involved

00:27:40.109 --> 00:27:45.369
high opportunity costs, in that they demanded
resources, financial and intellectual, that

00:27:45.369 --> 00:27:50.710
could have been devoted to other more easily
attainable objectives.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:55.009
And of course, I'm sure you're all-- The thought
bubble that is right now is the internet above

00:27:55.009 --> 00:27:56.009
your heads.

00:27:56.009 --> 00:27:57.799
A very similar situation.

00:27:57.799 --> 00:28:05.690
No one realized what would grow up when DARPA
first started connecting computers.

00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:06.980
So what's changed?

00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.879
Why are we incapable of summoning the will,
the confidence, and the unity to produce similar

00:28:11.879 --> 00:28:18.029
achievements against a threat that is every
bit as existential as World War II or the

00:28:18.029 --> 00:28:19.190
Cold War?

00:28:19.190 --> 00:28:22.289
The first and most obvious is the political
system.

00:28:22.289 --> 00:28:26.460
I probably don't need to tell any of you how
impossible it is to get the US Congress to

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:31.830
take action on any critical matter of long-term
national security and prosperity.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:34.820
The other change, however, is the financial
system.

00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:39.970
Current levels of government debt make a quote
"new Manhattan Project for energy" unquote

00:28:39.970 --> 00:28:40.970
impossible.

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:45.289
At the same time, the evolution of the private
sector financial system, particularly private

00:28:45.289 --> 00:28:49.780
equity in the stock market, favors quick returns
over long-term investment.

00:28:49.780 --> 00:28:53.539
Clear exit strategies over building new industries.

00:28:53.539 --> 00:28:57.869
Consumer focused technologies, mobile phones
and applications, social media, new forms

00:28:57.869 --> 00:29:01.929
of entertainment, over large and complex infrastructure
projects.

00:29:01.929 --> 00:29:07.409
And again, we've seen a pretty clear example
of that in what's happened with the Facebook

00:29:07.409 --> 00:29:09.629
IPO over the last several weeks.

00:29:09.629 --> 00:29:13.720
In other words, we can't do it because we've
never done it before, and even if we could

00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.429
do it, the public will never support it.

00:29:16.429 --> 00:29:20.100
But again, there's a counterexample.

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:27.129
The rebirth of the US auto industry, based
on 80 billion dollars in federal loans and

00:29:27.129 --> 00:29:32.749
investments, allowed GM and Chrysler to exit
bankruptcy and begin paying back the loans

00:29:32.749 --> 00:29:35.039
from the US Treasury by the end of 2009.

00:29:35.039 --> 00:29:40.820
In the first quarter of last year, both GM
and Chrysler, along with Ford, posted quarterly

00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:46.679
net profits and were achieving their first
sustained net sales gain since the 1980s.

00:29:46.679 --> 00:29:51.450
The automakers turnaround helped stabilize
the overall US economy and helped the manufacturing

00:29:51.450 --> 00:29:57.830
sector add almost a quarter million jobs between
the end of 2009 and mid 2011.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:30:03.049
This was industrial policy, although nobody
wants to call it that because that, for years,

00:30:03.049 --> 00:30:05.519
has been a term of contempt in Washington.

00:30:05.519 --> 00:30:07.470
And it worked.

00:30:07.470 --> 00:30:11.730
So what are the lessons for the energy industry
from the auto bailout?

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.000
First of all, there has to be a sense of crisis.

00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:19.030
Two major US automakers failing in the midst
of a global financial crisis constituted a

00:30:19.030 --> 00:30:20.710
crisis in most people's minds.

00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:26.130
But the majority of Americans I mentioned
earlier don't see the prospect of global warming

00:30:26.130 --> 00:30:27.619
as a crisis.

00:30:27.619 --> 00:30:33.419
Number two is that long-term social and national
economic goals, not just narrow shareholder

00:30:33.419 --> 00:30:37.309
value, must guide the transformation.

00:30:37.309 --> 00:30:41.889
Having a strong and competitive auto industry
is clearly seen as a key national interest.

00:30:41.889 --> 00:30:47.509
Having a strong competitive and innovative
energy industry is also a key national interest.

00:30:47.509 --> 00:30:52.639
New technology must be the basis of the transformation,
with a few notable exceptions.

00:30:52.639 --> 00:30:57.730
The nuclear power industry's plans for the
next generation of reactors can be summarized

00:30:57.730 --> 00:31:00.279
as the same, only more so.

00:31:00.279 --> 00:31:05.200
Any nationwide energy strategy should promote
and require the rapid development and deployment

00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.460
of new forms of nuclear power, especially
liquid-fueled thorium reactors.

00:31:10.460 --> 00:31:13.740
Government support is necessary, but must
be limited and conditional.

00:31:13.740 --> 00:31:19.919
The big auto makers wound up repaying the
billions invested in them by the US government,

00:31:19.919 --> 00:31:21.279
but that funding came at a price.

00:31:21.279 --> 00:31:27.179
They had to replace top executives and invest
in new technology, come up with new labor

00:31:27.179 --> 00:31:29.570
relations and new production systems.

00:31:29.570 --> 00:31:31.850
Everyone had to give up something.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:35.489
The transformation must draw on America's
innate competitive advantages.

00:31:35.489 --> 00:31:41.690
The US has the top engineering schools in
the world, a vibrant alternative energy investment

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:48.090
market, a pervasive though aging power grid,
and increasingly open and deregulated energy

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:49.090
markets.

00:31:49.090 --> 00:31:53.419
Also, large numbers of investors, scientists,
and entrepreneurs who view the energy crisis

00:31:53.419 --> 00:31:56.460
as the signal challenge of the 21st century.

00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.340
Plus, we invented thorium-fueled reactors.

00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:03.499
So how much would all this cost?

00:32:03.499 --> 00:32:08.019
These are a couple of graphs about trying
to figure out what the real cost of energy

00:32:08.019 --> 00:32:10.359
is.

00:32:10.359 --> 00:32:13.730
Nuclear power is in the middle of both these
graphs.

00:32:13.730 --> 00:32:21.259
There have been various attempts to calculate
the overall cost of electricity from a thorium-fueled

00:32:21.259 --> 00:32:23.139
nuclear plant.

00:32:23.139 --> 00:32:27.270
That depends on many factors that are pretty
hard to calculate right now, including the

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:33.070
cost of capital, length of time licensing
operating costs such as labor and overtime,

00:32:33.070 --> 00:32:35.340
operating efficiency, and so on.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:41.360
But various thorium supporters have calculated
that the overnight cost for a LFTR plant,

00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:46.720
the overnight costs are the costs to build
and start up a plant excluding interest and

00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:52.859
other collateral costs, and they came up with
a range of around $2200 per kilowatt of capacity,

00:32:52.859 --> 00:32:54.970
plus or minus 30% or so.

00:32:54.970 --> 00:32:59.970
So a 1 megawatt prototype plant would cost
2.2 million in overnight costs.

00:32:59.970 --> 00:33:05.860
And a commercial 1000 megawatt plant would
cost around 2.2 billion.

00:33:05.860 --> 00:33:11.389
Other estimators have come up with lower costs
around $1400 per kilowatt.

00:33:11.389 --> 00:33:16.629
I would argue that what we're going to see
is once LFTRs, liquid-fueled thorium reactors,

00:33:16.629 --> 00:33:21.989
start to be built, the cost of the technology
is going to come down fairly rapidly.

00:33:21.989 --> 00:33:26.639
But you have to factor in the social costs
as well.

00:33:26.639 --> 00:33:28.850
Liquid-fueled thorium reactors are carbon
free.

00:33:28.850 --> 00:33:32.370
Their contribution to nuclear proliferation
risk is essentially zero.

00:33:32.370 --> 00:33:39.649
They not only eliminate the cost of long-term
storage of new radioactive waste, but also

00:33:39.649 --> 00:33:45.129
can process existing waste from conventional
plants, making it very much easier to store.

00:33:45.129 --> 00:33:51.769
They'll jump start a new era of energy technology
innovation that will benefit companies in

00:33:51.769 --> 00:33:56.080
the nation in ways that are impossible to
quantify right now.

00:33:56.080 --> 00:34:00.340
Considering those benefits, there's no question
that thorium power offers the most economical

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:05.429
avenue to bring on line massive amounts of
new generating capacity without adding to

00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:08.460
current levels of carbon emissions.

00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:12.770
So how much do we need?

00:34:12.770 --> 00:34:18.619
In 2010, the US consumed about 3.8 million
gigawatt hours of electricity.

00:34:18.619 --> 00:34:23.679
Coal accounted for 44% of that, nuclear, as
I've said, for about 20%.

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:29.319
Total US electricity generating capacity is
about a thousand gigawatts.

00:34:29.319 --> 00:34:35.059
Under an optimistic scenario for renewable
energy production from wind, solar, biomass,

00:34:35.059 --> 00:34:40.899
geothermal, and so on, let's say that to reduce
carbon emissions enough to stave off catastrophic

00:34:40.899 --> 00:34:47.079
climate change, by 2050 we must increase the
portion of our electricity generated by power

00:34:47.079 --> 00:34:48.230
to half.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:54.809
One half of a thousand gigawatts is 500 gigawatts
or 500,000 megawatts of capacity.

00:34:54.809 --> 00:34:57.839
That's a lot.

00:34:57.839 --> 00:34:59.819
What are the goals?

00:34:59.819 --> 00:35:05.660
Electricity demand, of course, will grow in
the next four decades.

00:35:05.660 --> 00:35:12.650
Some people think as much as 50-60%, but I'm
being optimistic, so let's say that improved

00:35:12.650 --> 00:35:18.609
conservation technology and changing consumer
habits will limit the increase in demand.

00:35:18.609 --> 00:35:25.290
We must build enough new nuclear power plants
to generate 500 gigawatts, or 500,000 megawatts

00:35:25.290 --> 00:35:31.260
of clean, low cost power by 2050.

00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:40.660
That's the equivalent of about 500 1000 megawatt
nuclear plants, or, if we built smaller modular

00:35:40.660 --> 00:35:45.000
liquid-fueled thorium reactors that can be
mass produced in a factory, that would be

00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:50.290
about 2000 250 megawatt reactors.

00:35:50.290 --> 00:35:59.069
That means between 2050 and 2050, over 30
years, we need to build about 17 new nuclear

00:35:59.069 --> 00:36:00.500
plants a year.

00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:07.260
Let's be ambitious and call it 20 new thousand
megawatt thorium plants a year, or 80 250

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:11.270
megawatt LFTRs, for a total of 600 plants.

00:36:11.270 --> 00:36:13.260
That's a hugely ambitious goal.

00:36:13.260 --> 00:36:16.089
But again, how much will it really cost?

00:36:16.089 --> 00:36:20.130
One of the beauties of LFTRs is that they
can be mass produced.

00:36:20.130 --> 00:36:26.560
Small modular reactors can be built in 250
megawatt sizes and assembled into larger plants.

00:36:26.560 --> 00:36:32.010
By comparison, Boeing builds about one 200
million dollar jet a day.

00:36:32.010 --> 00:36:37.470
A modern airliner has many more moving parts
and greater overall complexity than a liquid-fueled

00:36:37.470 --> 00:36:39.780
thorium reactor.

00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:45.250
If we build, say, four plants for manufacturing
LFTRs, with each plant producing five reactors

00:36:45.250 --> 00:36:47.480
a year, that would just about do the trick.

00:36:47.480 --> 00:36:53.690
Think about the jobs and the spillover economic
benefits for the states in which those plants

00:36:53.690 --> 00:36:56.690
are located.

00:36:56.690 --> 00:37:01.310
Technology advances, again, will bring the
costs down rapidly after commercialization,

00:37:01.310 --> 00:37:03.630
potentially to the cost of a new jet.

00:37:03.630 --> 00:37:08.010
Let's call it one billion dollars per thousand
megawatt plant.

00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:16.771
Cost of building 600,000 megawatt LFTRs or
600,000 megawatt plants or 2400 250 megawatt

00:37:16.771 --> 00:37:19.960
machines would come to 600 billion.

00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:25.839
Add 15% for startup costs and financing, round
up, you've got 700 billion dollars.

00:37:25.839 --> 00:37:27.920
That's a lot of money.

00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:29.250
But let's put it in perspective.

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:34.500
In 2010, the budget for the US Department
of Defense was about 685 billion dollars,

00:37:34.500 --> 00:37:39.500
which, by the way, is almost as much as every
other country in the world combined spends

00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:41.569
on their military.

00:37:41.569 --> 00:37:50.099
In other words, for about what we spend in
one year on defense, we can build a thorium-based

00:37:50.099 --> 00:37:55.720
carbon free energy economy that can last a
millennium.

00:37:55.720 --> 00:38:02.420
Many people will, and frankly already have,
scoffed at this program, calling it unrealistic,

00:38:02.420 --> 00:38:04.700
too expensive, too risky.

00:38:04.700 --> 00:38:09.320
Again, we can't do it because we've never
done it before.

00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:13.339
But you have to consider the costs, direct
and indirect, of building any other type of

00:38:13.339 --> 00:38:17.799
thousand megawatt power plant, whether it's
coal, conventional nuclear, solar, natural

00:38:17.799 --> 00:38:23.790
gas, or of doing nothing and allowing climate
change to run rampant by mid century.

00:38:23.790 --> 00:38:28.359
Building a couple dozen LFTRs a year starts
to sound like a bargain.

00:38:28.359 --> 00:38:33.069
It's important to remember the obstacles to
creating a thorium power economy in the next

00:38:33.069 --> 00:38:38.280
40 years are not technological or economic,
they are political and commercial, Ultimately,

00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:41.680
the thorium revival is about the choices we
make as a society.

00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:46.520
If we don't do it, it will be because we chose
not to, not because it was impossible.

00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.069
Thanks very much.

00:38:50.069 --> 00:38:51.260
[applause]

00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:55.440
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin] So we have some time for
questions.

00:38:55.440 --> 00:38:57.520
&gt;&gt;[Boris] Yes, we have some time for questions.

00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.869
If you have a question, please raise your
hand.

00:38:59.869 --> 00:39:01.170
I'll give you the mike.

00:39:01.170 --> 00:39:06.829
&gt;&gt;[audience member #1] So Energy Secretary
Chu, and I believe somebody asked him about

00:39:06.829 --> 00:39:07.829
thorium plants.

00:39:07.829 --> 00:39:16.349
I think, if I recall correctly, his response
was that the technology wasn't there, like

00:39:16.349 --> 00:39:23.540
the liquid fluoride thorium salts are very
caustic and would just eat through the piping

00:39:23.540 --> 00:39:24.540
or whatever.

00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.750
What can you tell us about that?

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:31.220
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin] What I can tell you about
it is that we've already done it.

00:39:31.220 --> 00:39:37.140
What this presentation doesn't cover, but
is covered in three chapters in SuperFuel,

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:42.680
is that in the 1960s at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, we ran what was called the molten

00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:50.030
salt reactor experiment under Alvin Weinberg,
who was the director of Oak Ridge at the time.

00:39:50.030 --> 00:39:57.750
I've actually gone to Oak Ridge and I've looked
at Weinberg's papers, which,-- And then again,

00:39:57.750 --> 00:40:03.940
this will give you an idea of how we've neglected
our history around nuclear power.

00:40:03.940 --> 00:40:07.369
his papers are stored at the Oak Ridge Children's
Museum in a walk-in closet.

00:40:07.369 --> 00:40:13.660
You walk in and there's literally filing cabinets
stacked to the ceiling, and nobody has gone

00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:16.450
through them, catalogued them, indexed them.

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:22.789
Anyway, the molten salt reactor experiment
ran from about '59 to '73.

00:40:22.789 --> 00:40:24.010
It was successful.

00:40:24.010 --> 00:40:26.990
They actually did not run it on thorium.

00:40:26.990 --> 00:40:35.380
They ran it first on conventional uranium
U-235, and then they started introducing U-233.

00:40:35.380 --> 00:40:41.599
But they used molten salt liquid fluoride,
which is the substance that Secretary Chu

00:40:41.599 --> 00:40:44.510
was talking about.

00:40:44.510 --> 00:40:51.740
There was a report at the end of that experiment,
which basically said-- and it had a cover

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:57.910
letter in which the atomic energy commission
said, "Congratulations, your experiment was

00:40:57.910 --> 00:41:01.059
a tremendous success, and now we're shutting
it down."

00:41:01.059 --> 00:41:07.609
What happened was instead of pursuing liquid-fueled
thorium reactors, we pursued fast metal breeder

00:41:07.609 --> 00:41:08.970
reactors.

00:41:08.970 --> 00:41:12.789
That was the Clinch River Project, which some
of you may recall.

00:41:12.789 --> 00:41:18.049
I've actually been to the site that was supposed--
where the Clinch River Fast Breeder was supposed

00:41:18.049 --> 00:41:19.049
to be built.

00:41:19.049 --> 00:41:23.820
I hopped a fence and trespassed on federal
property, walked out to the river.

00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:25.060
It's an empty field.

00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:31.529
We poured 8 billion dollars down the rat hole
of fast breeder reactors, and we didn't turn

00:41:31.529 --> 00:41:32.529
a spade.

00:41:32.529 --> 00:41:38.400
So when people say it hasn't been proven,
well, again, there's lots of things that haven't

00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:43.590
been proven that we go ahead and build and
we figure it out on the way.

00:41:43.590 --> 00:41:45.599
Material science is an important component.

00:41:45.599 --> 00:41:49.549
The thing about LFTRs is they're going to
run not for 20 or 30 or 40 years, they're

00:41:49.549 --> 00:41:54.210
going to run for 100 years.

00:41:54.210 --> 00:42:00.910
One of the remaining technological hurdles
is to come up with the piping, essentially

00:42:00.910 --> 00:42:03.750
the plumbing, that will stand up for that
long.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:09.160
But to say that we haven't developed this
technology is just wrong.

00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:15.109
Just a side note on Secretary Chu, people
in the thorium movement have combed his public

00:42:15.109 --> 00:42:21.960
utterances looking for the word "thorium",
and the fact is he's in a constrained, politically

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:28.890
appointed post, so I'm not going to presume
to know what's really on his mind but I do

00:42:28.890 --> 00:42:36.220
know he's in favor of advanced nuclear and
I do know that thorium-- Everything else is

00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:40.170
an incremental step on what we've already
done, and it uses uranium.

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:44.359
Thorium power is the only truly innovative
form of nuclear power technology that's available

00:42:44.359 --> 00:42:48.090
to us today.

00:42:48.090 --> 00:42:54.050
Secretary Chu is in a position where he's
not about to outrage the entire existing nuclear

00:42:54.050 --> 00:42:57.680
power establishment by saying, "We need to
build thorium power reactors."

00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:04.760
So I find it hard to believe that he really
believes a statement like that that really

00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:11.050
ignores 
the history.

00:43:11.050 --> 00:43:12.109
[pause] Yes.

00:43:12.109 --> 00:43:13.109
[pause]

00:43:13.109 --> 00:43:18.779
&gt;&gt;[audience member #2] So you talk a little
about-- a fair amount about the US Congress

00:43:18.779 --> 00:43:21.000
and the inability to get stuff done.

00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:26.319
But what about China and other countries that
are maybe less constrained by history?

00:43:26.319 --> 00:43:30.170
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin] Thank you for asking.

00:43:30.170 --> 00:43:38.710
In 2010, I was the first reporter in the West
to break the story that China is pursuing

00:43:38.710 --> 00:43:41.359
a liquid-fueled thorium reactor.

00:43:41.359 --> 00:43:43.920
They have committed money to it.

00:43:43.920 --> 00:43:46.970
It's a state-sponsored program.

00:43:46.970 --> 00:43:48.569
So they're moving forward.

00:43:48.569 --> 00:43:55.170
India has a program that's actually been in
place for a few decades.

00:43:55.170 --> 00:44:00.869
They call it the "Three Stage Program" to
build dozens of new reactors and convert them

00:44:00.869 --> 00:44:06.359
over time in three stages, as you might guess,
to thorium reactors.

00:44:06.359 --> 00:44:09.579
But those are solid fuel reactors, and there's
a lot of problems with that.

00:44:09.579 --> 00:44:15.940
The basic thing about putting solid thorium
fuel into a more or less conventional reactor,

00:44:15.940 --> 00:44:18.890
I compare to putting biofuel in a Hummer.

00:44:18.890 --> 00:44:24.390
It might be a little bit better, but you don't
really capture the true advantages of thorium

00:44:24.390 --> 00:44:27.109
power.

00:44:27.109 --> 00:44:29.540
So India and China are moving forward.

00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:36.920
And one other answer to that question: I did
a story for Fortune last year on the rare

00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:38.760
earths market.

00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:43.790
Rare earths, as I'm sure everyone knows, are
the lanthanide elements, which are used in

00:44:43.790 --> 00:44:48.770
a variety of high tech applications, including
smartphone displays, including missile guidance

00:44:48.770 --> 00:44:53.829
systems, including electric vehicles.

00:44:53.829 --> 00:44:59.000
Unsurprisingly, the US used to be the world's
leading source of rare earths.

00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.880
Today, China controls 98% of that market.

00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:05.890
When you find rare earths, you almost always
find thorium.

00:45:05.890 --> 00:45:10.250
So there's these huge mines in western China
where they're producing rare earths, for export

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:16.230
mostly, and thorium is produced as a byproduct.

00:45:16.230 --> 00:45:20.369
Reports out of China are that they are stockpiling
that thorium.

00:45:20.369 --> 00:45:27.010
Meanwhile, a company called Molycorp is restarting
the Mountain Pass mine, which is on the border

00:45:27.010 --> 00:45:32.799
between California and Nevada, it's outside
Las Vegas, which once was the biggest rare

00:45:32.799 --> 00:45:34.440
earth mine in the world.

00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.349
They're putting a few billion dollars into
restarting production at Mountain Pass.

00:45:39.349 --> 00:45:43.180
I was there last fall, and I said, "What are
you going to do with the thorium?"

00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:46.940
They're going to treat it as radioactive waste
and bury it in concrete.

00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:51.089
The executive said, "If there were a market
for this stuff, we'd love to sell it.

00:45:51.089 --> 00:45:56.000
But there isn't, and regulations require us
to treat it as radioactive waste."

00:45:56.000 --> 00:46:02.230
So China is stockpiling the stuff and planning
on building LFTRs, and we are getting rid

00:46:02.230 --> 00:46:04.190
of it.

00:46:04.190 --> 00:46:05.549
That's what's happening.

00:46:05.549 --> 00:46:07.099
And just one more word on that.

00:46:07.099 --> 00:46:12.069
A lot of people in the thorium movement present
it as this apocalypse for the US.

00:46:12.069 --> 00:46:16.309
If we don't build thorium reactors and we
let China lead the way in this technology

00:46:16.309 --> 00:46:19.050
that we originally developed, we're never
going to catch up.

00:46:19.050 --> 00:46:21.529
It's going to be the Roman empire all over
again.

00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:25.299
I'm not quite that apocalyptic about it.

00:46:25.299 --> 00:46:30.360
There are many things that the US still produces
that other countries want to buy.

00:46:30.360 --> 00:46:37.309
But it is true that it would be crazy for
us to give up the technology that we developed

00:46:37.309 --> 00:46:41.380
back in the 1960s to another country.

00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:50.220
But the thing is, speaking as an internationalist,
it would be a great thing if China built thorium-based

00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:55.750
reactors instead of, for instance, coal plants,
because, if you want to do something about

00:46:55.750 --> 00:46:59.890
global warming, basically what-- the whole
rest of the world doesn't matter unless we

00:46:59.890 --> 00:47:02.299
control it in China.

00:47:02.299 --> 00:47:08.059
Speaking as a citizen of the globe, it would
be wonderful if China pursued this technology.

00:47:08.059 --> 00:47:10.160
[pause] Yes, sir.

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:11.160
[pause]

00:47:11.160 --> 00:47:18.049
&gt;&gt;[audience member #3] As you noted that basically,
the global warming and stuff like that is

00:47:18.049 --> 00:47:21.900
not going to convince the public, at least
in the near future.

00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:27.710
So why can't the alternative arguments, like
basically the limited resources of the fossil

00:47:27.710 --> 00:47:31.240
fuel or the rising cost of that can be used
instead?

00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:38.839
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin] Well, here's one problem
with the argument over limited resources of

00:47:38.839 --> 00:47:40.869
fossil fuels.

00:47:40.869 --> 00:47:45.740
Let's call it the "peak oil argument" for
short.

00:47:45.740 --> 00:47:47.130
We keep finding more.

00:47:47.130 --> 00:47:51.589
Specifically, we keep finding more natural
gas through hydraulic fracturing.

00:47:51.589 --> 00:47:54.630
And again, I'm not going to say that that's
a terrible thing.

00:47:54.630 --> 00:47:57.230
That's a good thing for the US.

00:47:57.230 --> 00:47:59.970
I'd rather build natural gas plants than coal
plants.

00:47:59.970 --> 00:48:05.680
There's a really interesting talk by Nathan
Myhrvold, former CTO of Microsoft, it's on

00:48:05.680 --> 00:48:08.790
Youtube now, in which he talked about the
natural gas boom.

00:48:08.790 --> 00:48:14.799
He said, "Look if you think that this is going
to A. provide quote energy independence unquote,

00:48:14.799 --> 00:48:21.720
which is an illusion anyway, and B. solve
global climate change, you're wrong."

00:48:21.720 --> 00:48:28.450
Natural gas, in combination with nuclear power,
I call it NP plus NG.

00:48:28.450 --> 00:48:33.079
If we can build natural gas plants and bring
thorium-based nuclear power online at the

00:48:33.079 --> 00:48:37.510
same time, that's a way out of the predicament.

00:48:37.510 --> 00:48:43.059
But to answer your question, the fact is,
I'm not sure what the argument is.

00:48:43.059 --> 00:48:49.890
Congress-- There have been several bipartisan
bills introduced in Congress to fund R&amp;D for

00:48:49.890 --> 00:48:53.130
thorium, and they've never gotten out of committee.

00:48:53.130 --> 00:49:00.390
There are friends of mine in the thorium movement
who are lobbying hard to get something done.

00:49:00.390 --> 00:49:05.470
Unfortunately, my view on that is that they're
going to grow old waiting for Congress to

00:49:05.470 --> 00:49:06.470
do something.

00:49:06.470 --> 00:49:14.790
I do think that, in combination with watching
China forge ahead in this technology and the

00:49:14.790 --> 00:49:22.980
prospect of losing another technology to the
booming economies of East Asia, combining

00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:28.930
that with the prospect of global climate change
does have a chance of convincing some of our

00:49:28.930 --> 00:49:33.720
political leaders and then even convincing
some of the public.

00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:39.130
Hopefully, the book and other efforts like
it will gradually educate the public.

00:49:39.130 --> 00:49:43.460
I think one of the things that have happened,
is what I talked about in the presentation,

00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:48.250
is overcoming this knee jerk response to nuclear
power.

00:49:48.250 --> 00:49:55.630
It's been interesting to watch the environmental
movement split as they realize the real danger

00:49:55.630 --> 00:50:03.670
is climate change, and we need to change our
automatic response to any form of nuclear

00:50:03.670 --> 00:50:04.799
power.

00:50:04.799 --> 00:50:07.240
You can just watch that split happening.

00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:12.380
So what is going to convince people and politicians?

00:50:12.380 --> 00:50:13.380
I'm not sure.

00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:20.430
But I do think this rising tide that I just
described has a chance of doing it.

00:50:20.430 --> 00:50:22.020
[pause] Yes.

00:50:22.020 --> 00:50:23.020
[pause]

00:50:23.020 --> 00:50:33.000
&gt;&gt;[audience member #4] I was wondering what
percent of the US's energy needs you envision

00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:34.000
thorium will satisfy.

00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:35.000
This is a two part question.

00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.869
Once that percent gets achieved, what do you
think the price of energy would be compared

00:50:40.869 --> 00:50:42.760
to what it is right now?

00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:47.390
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin] [clears throat] Let's talk
about price first.

00:50:47.390 --> 00:50:51.079
The thing about nuclear power is all the costs
are upfront.

00:50:51.079 --> 00:50:52.829
It's all cap ex.

00:50:52.829 --> 00:50:57.830
Once you've got it-- Even uranium right now
is cheap and plentiful, and there's plenty

00:50:57.830 --> 00:51:01.490
of people who, including me, who argue that's
not going to last.

00:51:01.490 --> 00:51:06.130
But once you've got a nuclear power plant,
it's very cheap to run.

00:51:06.130 --> 00:51:09.690
Somebody told me that the cost of fuel in
a nuclear power plant is less than what they

00:51:09.690 --> 00:51:12.089
pay the security guards.

00:51:12.089 --> 00:51:17.569
So the challenge is the upfront financing.

00:51:17.569 --> 00:51:22.180
This slide, I went back to this just to answer
the first part of that question, which is

00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:28.130
the program that I've outlined is to supply
half of our electricity capacity by 2050.

00:51:28.130 --> 00:51:32.210
In other words, about 500 gigawatts.

00:51:32.210 --> 00:51:33.210
That's huge.

00:51:33.210 --> 00:51:36.390
I don't want to underestimate that at all.

00:51:36.390 --> 00:51:42.180
Building 600 nuclear plants between 2020 and
2050 seems impossible.

00:51:42.180 --> 00:51:49.730
But again, if we can shift our thinking and
shift the process around building and deploying

00:51:49.730 --> 00:51:54.019
these plants, it's technologically achievable.

00:51:54.019 --> 00:52:01.220
So that's what I'm looking at: basically half
of our energy demand supplied by thorium-based

00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:03.130
nuclear power by 2050.

00:52:03.130 --> 00:52:09.510
And I just want to stress I am all in favor
of renewables, but they're just not going

00:52:09.510 --> 00:52:13.400
to do the trick in the next 30 to 50 years.

00:52:13.400 --> 00:52:18.570
The price of solar power is declining rapidly,
and that's a great thing, but it's still the

00:52:18.570 --> 00:52:25.779
percentage of pure renewable power right now
of our overall demand is in the low single

00:52:25.779 --> 00:52:30.910
digits, and it's not going to change significantly
in my lifetime, frankly.

00:52:30.910 --> 00:52:33.850
So we do need nuclear power.

00:52:33.850 --> 00:52:38.829
I believe that we can get to 50% by 2050.

00:52:38.829 --> 00:52:45.410
Again, the cost is high, but in perspective,
compared to what we spend on defense and what

00:52:45.410 --> 00:52:53.609
we would have to spend on other forms of power
generation, it's a bargain.

00:52:53.609 --> 00:52:57.589
[pause]
&gt;&gt;[Boris:]Well, thank you.

00:52:57.589 --> 00:52:58.589
&gt;&gt;[Richard Martin:]Thanks very much.

00:52:58.589 --> 00:52:59.589
Thanks for having me.

00:52:59.589 --> 00:52:59.720
[applause]
