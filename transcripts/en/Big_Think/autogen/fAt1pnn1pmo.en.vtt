I fear death, I think like everyone else.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:11.950
One of the things that the threats have done
is they have made me aware of how short life

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:18.789
is, and how trivial things can sometimes take
the pleasure away from life.

00:00:18.789 --> 00:00:21.509
And so to shrug those small things off.

00:00:21.509 --> 00:00:30.060
You know, the constant idea that life is short,
so paradoxically I've been leading a much,

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:37.050
I think more meaningful and better life after
the threats than before the threats when small

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:50.630
things would bother me, the weather, feeling
too cold, or not getting what I wanted.
