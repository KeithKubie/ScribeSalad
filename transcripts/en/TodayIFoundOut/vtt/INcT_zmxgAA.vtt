00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:17.790
Haley’s Comet 
and Mark Twain’s Prediction

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:22.359
In 1909, Samuel Clemens—known by his pen
name, Mark Twain—said,

00:00:22.359 --> 00:00:24.390
I came in with Halley’s Comet in 1835.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:28.200
It is coming again next year, and I expect
to go out with it.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.619
It will be the greatest disappointment of
my life if I don’t go out with Halley’s

00:00:32.619 --> 00:00:33.619
Comet.

00:00:33.619 --> 00:00:38.120
The Almighty has said, no doubt: ‘Now here
are these two unaccountable freaks; they came

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.950
in together, they must go out together.

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.250
Clemens was indeed born just after Halley’s
Comet appeared in 1835, and, true to his prediction,

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:50.620
he died of a heart attack one day after it
appeared at its brightest in 1910.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.090
While this association, combined with Clemens’
foretelling of his own death, is probably

00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:00.680
unique, Halley’s Comet has been the subject
of a string of predictions since 1705.

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:05.710
That was the year that Sir Edmond Halley first
realized that comets sighted in 1531, 1607,

00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:08.820
and 1682 were all the same comet.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:13.440
In his A Synopsis of the Astronomy of Comets,
Halley stated that the comets all appeared

00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:16.500
very similar in their orbit and various other
parameters.

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:21.920
From his conclusion, he calculated that it
would reappear in 1758.

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.790
Halley died before he was able to see his
prediction come true.

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:28.980
As reliable as ever, the comet appeared late
that year and reached perihelion—when it

00:01:28.980 --> 00:01:32.500
emerged from the far side of the Sun—in
1759.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:36.200
The comet was named “Halley’s Comet”
in honour of the man who had discovered its

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.200
pattern.

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.510
Because of its orbit, Halley’s Comet always
shows up around every 76 years, just as Halley

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:43.510
calculated.

00:01:43.510 --> 00:01:46.870
However, due to the gravitational pull of
the planets that it passes, it’s sometimes

00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:48.700
a year or two off the mark.

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:53.310
After the find, scientists began to calculate
when Halley’s Comet appeared in the past,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.870
while trying to account for the slight deviation.

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:59.710
The dates they came up with matched up with
a surprising number of recorded comet sightings

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:00.810
in history.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:05.270
The oldest commonly accepted date for the
first documented reference of Halley’s Comet

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:09.509
is 240 B.C., when it was sighted by Chinese
astronomers.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:14.730
The passing of the comet was recorded in Shih
Chi and Wen Hsien Thung Khao chronicles.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:19.269
However, it’s possible that it could be
the comet observed in Greece as far back as

00:02:19.269 --> 00:02:23.310
467 B.C., making it the earliest known recorded
sighting.

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:27.420
Back then, no one thought to keep track of
the time between comets to see if one might

00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.700
be recurring.

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:33.180
Comets were seen as isolated events and a
sort of herald of change or disaster.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:39.230
As Shakespeare wrote in Julius Caesar around
1600: “When beggars die there are no comets

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:43.469
seen; The heavens themselves blaze forth the
death of princes.”

00:02:43.469 --> 00:02:49.459
(Interestingly, Halley’s Comet would have
passed in Caesar’s lifetime around 87 B.C.—two

00:02:49.459 --> 00:02:53.319
years before his father died and Caesar became
the head of his family).

00:02:53.319 --> 00:02:56.310
The comet has, in fact, been at the centre
of a few historical events.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.540
For instance, William the Conqueror took the
comet as a good omen when it showed up just

00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:03.529
before the 1066 invasion of England.

00:03:03.529 --> 00:03:08.799
The comet was memorialized on the massive
Bayeux Tapestry which was made after the invasion.

00:03:08.799 --> 00:03:12.840
The tapestry shows people celebrating the
crowning of King Harold, terrified of the

00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.489
comet soaring above.

00:03:14.489 --> 00:03:19.019
Below King Harold is a fleet of ships, hinting
at the coming Norman Conquest.

00:03:19.019 --> 00:03:23.659
We can be fairly certain that the 1066 comet
was indeed Halley’s Comet because of one

00:03:23.659 --> 00:03:25.250
Eilmer of Malmesbury.

00:03:25.250 --> 00:03:31.819
Eilmer was a monk born around 980 AD who was
able to see the comet twice in his lifetime.

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:36.999
The first was in 989, and he had a feeling
it was a bad omen; soon after its appearance,

00:03:36.999 --> 00:03:39.319
his town was attacked by the Danes.

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:43.779
He lived to see the comet again in 1066 and
it appears that Eilmer, at least, saw the

00:03:43.779 --> 00:03:48.590
correlation between the 989 comet and the
1066 comet.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:52.049
However, others didn’t pick up on the pattern
until Halley in 1705.

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:54.760
Writing following the comet’s second appearance,
Eilmer said:

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.409
“You’ve come, have you?

00:03:56.409 --> 00:03:59.499
… You’ve come, you source of tears to
many mothers, you evil.

00:03:59.499 --> 00:04:00.730
I hate you!

00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.010
It is long since I saw you; but as I see you
now you are much more terrible, for I see

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.389
you brandishing the downfall of my country.

00:04:08.389 --> 00:04:10.180
I hate you!”

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:14.629
In 1222, the comet passed by Earth again,
heralding similar doom.

00:04:14.629 --> 00:04:17.250
This time, Genghis Khan started marching west.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.260
Apparently, he thought of the comet, which
was heading west the same as he did, as his

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:22.479
personal star.

00:04:22.479 --> 00:04:27.199
Of course, the invasion of Europe would leave
millions of people dead—not such a great

00:04:27.199 --> 00:04:28.860
omen for them.

00:04:28.860 --> 00:04:30.639
Fast forward back to 1910.

00:04:30.639 --> 00:04:35.340
The death of Clemens was, of course, a sad
event for the literary world, but the year

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:38.790
could be seen as an omen ushering in a new
age on Earth.

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:41.569
That year, the first photograph was taken
of Halley’s Comet, pictured in the show

00:04:41.569 --> 00:04:46.560
notes, and between that sighting and the next
in 1986, mankind would advance technologically

00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:51.590
in wondrous ways, far more rapidly than at
any other known time in our history.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:56.039
Of course, we also waged war among ourselves
at a baffling scale a couple times,and even

00:04:56.039 --> 00:05:00.090
came extremely close to possibly destroying
most of the life on Earth.

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:03.960
On the flip-side, around the same time we
were nearly destroying ourselves- illustrating

00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.210
the need for humans to spread out among the
heavens- we took our first steps away from

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.750
this giant space vessel known as Earth.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:16.770
Further, for one all too brief moment, humanity
was united in 1969 as we watched the first

00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.020
human step out onto the surface of the Moon.

00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:24.400
When Halley’s comet arrived again in 1986,
the first observation of the comet from space

00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400
was made.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:29.280
This turned out to be fortunate, because the
view from Earth was very disappointing.

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.680
In fact, according to a study published in
the Royal Astronomical Society of Canada Journal,

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:37.919
the 1986 view of the comet was the worst in
about 2,000 years.

00:05:37.919 --> 00:05:41.810
This was compounded by the fact that light
pollution made it impossible for many to see

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:43.159
it even with binoculars.

00:05:43.159 --> 00:05:47.280
However, the “Halley’s Armada,” as the
“fleet” of spaceships sent up to observe

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.639
the comet from space was called, was able
to snap good quality pictures of the comet,

00:05:51.639 --> 00:05:54.360
even capturing pictures of its nucleus.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.550
On the advances, NASA commented: “It was
inevitable that this most famous of all comets

00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:03.539
would receive unprecedented attention, but
the actual magnitude of the effort has surprised

00:06:03.539 --> 00:06:05.870
even most of those involved in it.”

00:06:05.870 --> 00:06:09.820
Unfortunately, NASA itself suffered a tragedy
in attempting to view Halley’s Comet from

00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:10.820
space.

00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.849
Part of the mission of the ill-fated Challenger
was to observe the comet, but of course it

00:06:14.849 --> 00:06:19.220
suffered a rocket malfunction and exploded
just minutes after take-off, killing everyone

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:20.220
on board.

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:24.810
The next time Halley’s Comet will swing
by Earth is in 2061, being at its brightest

00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.289
in July of that year.

00:06:26.289 --> 00:06:30.270
Thankfully, it is expected that it will be
much brighter than in 1986.

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:34.121
Perhaps by that time, if you’re still around,
you’ll be able to view it from, say, an

00:06:34.121 --> 00:06:35.740
orbiting resort or from the Moon.

00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:36.740
Who knows?

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:40.620
You may even be able to see it at a completely
different date from a colony on Mars or taking

00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:54.770
a ship out to meet it.
