00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm Dan Massey and I'm gonna
show you how I collected venom

00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:11.896
from scorpions for a research project.

00:00:12.406 --> 00:00:14.526
This process of collecting
venom is called milking.

00:00:14.946 --> 00:00:17.226
In this video, I'm milking scorpions in my home.

00:00:17.876 --> 00:00:21.256
What I have here is a Bark Scorpion
which until recently was found primarily

00:00:21.256 --> 00:00:22.396
in Arizona and Mexico.

00:00:22.826 --> 00:00:25.836
The Bark Scorpion's venom can
cause severe neurotoxic symptoms

00:00:26.146 --> 00:00:28.516
and in some cases, require hospitalization.

00:00:29.076 --> 00:00:32.426
The only way a scorpion can hurt you is
by stinging you with the tip of its tail,

00:00:32.426 --> 00:00:34.216
called the Telson and injecting venom.

00:00:34.706 --> 00:00:38.016
The scorpion's pincers are
quite weak so if I use forceps

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:40.296
to hold the scorpion by the
tail, it can't hurt me.

00:00:40.766 --> 00:00:44.766
In order to collect scorpion venom for my
study, I need the scorpion to express its venom.

00:00:44.956 --> 00:00:47.816
To do this, I administer a
low electrical stimulation.

00:00:48.406 --> 00:00:51.866
The electricity doesn't hurt the scorpion
but does make it express its venom.

00:00:52.476 --> 00:00:55.936
To administer the stimulation, I hold
the scorpion with a pair of forceps.

00:00:56.516 --> 00:01:00.016
The forceps have a positive
electrical lead attached to them.

00:01:00.016 --> 00:01:04.026
Another wire, a negative electrical
lead, is attached to this tea strainer.

00:01:04.616 --> 00:01:07.796
When I touch the scorpion to the tea
strainer, it completes the circuit

00:01:07.866 --> 00:01:10.666
and the scorpion receives a
low electrical stimulation.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:14.846
Right now, there's no stimulation applied
to the scorpion but when I touch it

00:01:14.846 --> 00:01:18.876
to the tea strainer, it completes
the circuit and expresses its venom.

00:01:18.876 --> 00:01:21.966
Since I do not wish to harm the
scorpion with increased electricity,

00:01:22.086 --> 00:01:29.206
agitating it also helps express venom.

00:01:29.616 --> 00:01:40.186
As the scorpion is stimulated, you can
see the tail pulsate and a tiny drop

00:01:40.186 --> 00:01:41.666
of venom expressed from the Telson.

00:01:42.286 --> 00:01:46.556
I have a capillary tube in my other hand so I
can collect the venom as it's being expressed.

00:01:48.686 --> 00:01:52.626
By the way, the forceps don't hurt the
scorpion, it's exoskeleton is very tough.

00:01:53.936 --> 00:01:56.866
A scorpion only releases a
tiny amount of venom at a time.

00:01:57.176 --> 00:02:00.416
It doesn't need to release more because
the venom works so well on its prey.

00:02:00.636 --> 00:02:05.386
You can see it takes a lot of patience
to milk scorpions and have it done

00:02:05.386 --> 00:02:07.246
in your home in an understanding family.

00:02:24.626 --> 00:02:34.206
I have more than 100 scorpions in my
home and my wife helped collect them all.

00:02:34.616 --> 00:02:37.186
We collected the scorpions from
the state part in New Mexico

00:02:37.186 --> 00:02:39.736
where the Bark scorpions
were previously undocumented.

00:02:40.536 --> 00:02:45.356
I wanted to obtain their venom so we could study
this new population of scorpions and compare it

00:02:45.356 --> 00:02:46.986
with populations of the same species.

00:02:47.686 --> 00:02:51.706
To do my research, I had to milk each
scorpion twice, three weeks apart.

00:02:52.086 --> 00:02:55.016
After being milked, the scorpion
needs around 2-3 weeks

00:02:55.016 --> 00:02:57.736
to regenerate its supply
of venom and a meal or two.

00:02:58.006 --> 00:03:00.636
It may only take a single
sting from a bark scorpion

00:03:00.636 --> 00:03:02.706
to cause neurotoxic symptoms in a human.

00:03:04.016 --> 00:03:07.726
To do research on scorpion venom,
you needed as much venom as possible

00:03:07.726 --> 00:03:09.666
to successfully perform experiments.

00:03:10.296 --> 00:03:13.756
That's why I had to milk more
than 100 scorpions more than once

00:03:14.036 --> 00:03:15.446
to get enough venom for the study.

00:03:17.036 --> 00:03:18.926
Here's another view of the
scorpion being milked.

00:03:19.606 --> 00:03:24.746
See how the tail pulses with the stimulation
and how only a tiny drop of venom comes out.

00:03:25.416 --> 00:03:27.566
And how I capture the venom
with a capillary tube.

00:03:27.986 --> 00:03:31.546
The most striking results of my
research were that the scorpions found

00:03:31.546 --> 00:03:34.506
in New Mexico were twice as
toxic as those from Arizona.

00:03:34.876 --> 00:03:39.736
And antivenom reverses the effects of
venom better in the New Mexico scorpions

00:03:39.736 --> 00:03:44.226
than in the Arizona scorpions even though
the two populations are the same species.

00:03:44.916 --> 00:03:49.716
In other words, it would only take about half
as much New Mexico scorpion venom compared

00:03:49.716 --> 00:03:52.656
to the Arizona scorpion venom
to create the same symptoms.

00:03:53.296 --> 00:03:58.586
Also, it would only require half as much
antivenom for the New Mexico scorpion compared

00:03:58.586 --> 00:04:00.806
to the Arizona scorpion to reverse the symptoms.

00:04:01.686 --> 00:04:04.626
These findings prove the need
for antivenom in New Mexico

00:04:04.626 --> 00:04:06.496
that might someday save a child's life.

00:04:06.766 --> 00:04:10.816
So now I'm interested in toxicology
and possibly venom research.

00:04:11.076 --> 00:04:15.406
The study showed an isolated population
of Bark scorpion being twice as potent

00:04:15.406 --> 00:04:20.926
as the large diverse population of the
same species and antivenom which seems

00:04:20.926 --> 00:04:25.136
to reverse the venom's effects
better even though it's more toxic.

00:04:25.136 --> 00:04:28.106
Why? Well, it's like everything in science.

00:04:28.236 --> 00:04:30.966
One answer leads to another question.

00:04:30.966 --> 00:04:31.946
But what can I say?

00:04:31.946 --> 00:04:39.026
I love science.
