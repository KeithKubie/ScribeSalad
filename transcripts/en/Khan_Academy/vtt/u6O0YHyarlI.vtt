00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.620
We're on problem number four,
and they give us a theorem.

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:08.240
It says a triangle has, at
most, one obtuse angle.

00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.240
Fair enough.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.850
Eduardo is proving the theorem
above by contradiction.

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.750
So the way you prove by a
contradiction, you're like,

00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:18.330
well what if this
weren't true.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.230
Let me prove that that
can't happen.

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:21.930
Well let's see what
he did anyway.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:26.480
He began by assuming, that in
triangle ABC, angle A and B

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:28.030
are both obtuse.

00:00:28.030 --> 00:00:32.520
Which theorem will Eduardo use
to reach a contradiction?

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.680
OK, let me draw this, what
Eduardo is trying to do.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.780
The way I'm drawing it is
actually very hard.

00:00:40.780 --> 00:00:42.610
So this is actually not
drawn at all to scale.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.010
So he's saying that angle A and
angle B are both obtuse.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.570
So this means that this angle
is greater than 90.

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:50.050
Let's say that's angle A.

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:51.290
And this is angle B.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:52.460
And it's also greater than 90.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.070
That's what obtuse means.

00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:58.510
Which theorem will Eduardo use
to reach a contradiction?

00:00:58.510 --> 00:01:01.420
Well, before even reading the
choices, think about it.

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:02.970
What do we know about
triangles?

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:07.580
That all of the angles add
up to 180 degrees, right?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.000
So if this is angle A, this is
angle B, and then let's call

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.460
this angle C.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:18.480
We know A plus B plus C
have to be equal to

00:01:18.480 --> 00:01:20.910
180 degrees, right?

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:29.240
Or another way to view it
is, C is equal to 180

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.100
minus A minus B.

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.750
Or another way you can think of
it, I'm just writing it a

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:34.470
bunch of different ways.

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:40.300
C is equal to 180 minus
A plus B, right?

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:42.110
Now, let me ask you
a question.

00:01:42.110 --> 00:01:46.400
If we assume from the get-go,
as Eduardo did, if we assume

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:50.920
that both A and B are greater
than 90 degrees, what's A plus

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:53.600
B going to be at least
greater than?

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.160
If this is greater than 90 and
that's greater than 90, then A

00:01:56.160 --> 00:01:59.010
plus B is going to be greater
than 90 plus 90.

00:01:59.010 --> 00:02:01.660
So this has to be greater
than 180.

00:02:01.660 --> 00:02:04.240
So if this is greater than 180,
and we're subtracting it

00:02:04.240 --> 00:02:10.690
from 180, so this essentially
says if angle A is greater

00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:15.340
than 90, and angle B is greater
than 90, than what we

00:02:15.340 --> 00:02:17.770
can deduce is, from this
statement right here.

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:20.310
From this equation right here.

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:22.370
If this and this is greater than
90 then this whole term

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:23.560
is greater than 180.

00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:26.760
So then the deduction would be
that C has to be less than

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:29.480
zero, and we can't have
negative angles.

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:34.910
So right there, that is
the contradiction.

00:02:34.910 --> 00:02:37.850
And then you would say, OK,
therefore you cannot have two

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.490
angles that are more than
90 degrees or two

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:42.490
angles that are obtuse.

00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.090
And that would be your proof
by contradiction.

00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:49.400
Let's see if what we did
can be phrased in

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.170
one of these choices.

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:53.010
If two angles of a triangle are
equal, the sides opposite

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.820
the angles are equal.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.380
No.

00:02:54.380 --> 00:03:01.410
If two supplementary angles
are equal, the angles each

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:02.410
measure 90.

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:05.290
Well, we didn't use that.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:07.020
The largest angle of a triangle
is opposite the

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.580
longest side.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:07.860
No.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.710
The sum of the measures of the
angles of a triangle is 180.

00:03:10.710 --> 00:03:13.370
That's the first thing we
wrote down right there.

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:15.720
So it's choice D.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:20.160
That's the theorem Eduardo used
to reach a contradiction.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:23.160
Next question.

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.410
Problem five.

00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:28.570
OK, this one.

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:36.210
OK, it's a big question.

00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:39.830
Let me see if I can copy and
paste the whole thing.

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:41.080
I've copied it.

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:45.520
All right.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.040
I think it all fits
in the window.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.960
Let's see, it says use
the proof to answer

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.110
the question below.

00:03:56.110 --> 00:04:02.860
So given that side AB is
congruent to side BC.

00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:05.810
So we could say that side
is equal to that side.

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:06.820
That's given.

00:04:06.820 --> 00:04:08.440
D is the midpoint of AC.

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:10.220
So that means D is equidistant
between AC.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:13.470
So that means that AD and
DC are equal length.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:14.720
Let me write that.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:27.225
Prove that triangle ABD is
congruent to to triangle CBD.

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.980
All right, and just so you know,
congruent triangles are

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.920
triangles that are the same in
every way, except they might

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:38.770
have been rotated.

00:04:38.770 --> 00:04:41.040
They could have been rotated
in some way.

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.480
If you had similar triangles,
then you could also have

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:44.520
different side measures.

00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:46.250
They're just kind of the same
shape, but they could be

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:50.120
expanded or contracted
in some way.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:53.390
If you're congruent, you have
similar triangles but they

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:54.980
also have the same
side lengths.

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:57.060
But even though they have the
same side lengths, they could

00:04:57.060 --> 00:04:57.900
be flipped over.

00:04:57.900 --> 00:04:59.440
Like, you can just
look at this one.

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.420
ABD looks like it's a
mirror image of DBC.

00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:07.610
So, just eyeballing it, it
already feels like they're

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:09.230
congruent triangles.

00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:11.920
Let's see how they go
about proving it.

00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:16.720
So statement one, AB
is congruent to BC,

00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:18.240
they give us that.

00:05:18.240 --> 00:05:19.740
D is the midpoint of AC.

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:22.070
That was given, fair enough.

00:05:22.070 --> 00:05:23.870
AD is congruent to CD.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:29.640
That's because D is the
midpoint of AC.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.060
We did that part right there,
definition of midpoint.

00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.420
Fair enough.

00:05:33.420 --> 00:05:37.790
BD is congruent to
BD, of course.

00:05:37.790 --> 00:05:40.300
Anything is congruent
to itself.

00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.990
So that just says the BD for
that triangle is the same

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:45.450
length as the BD for
this triangle.

00:05:45.450 --> 00:05:47.270
Fair enough, reflexive
property.

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:50.300
Fancy word for a very
simple idea.

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:54.870
And then finally, they
say triangle ABD is

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:57.270
congruent to CBD.

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:01.180
OK, well from the get-go, using
these statments, we've

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:02.640
already shown that they
have the same

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.050
exact three side measures.

00:06:05.050 --> 00:06:07.470
Both triangles have a
side of length BD.

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:10.960
Both triangles have a side
of length AD or DC.

00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.930
And both triangles have
a side of length BA.

00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:16.570
So all of their sides
are the same length.

00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:21.100
That's what we know after
the first three steps.

00:06:21.100 --> 00:06:24.670
So what reason can be used
to prove that the

00:06:24.670 --> 00:06:25.420
triangles are congruent?

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.230
Well we just said, these three
steps showed that all the

00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:29.650
sides are the same.

00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:32.060
So this SSS that you see.

00:06:32.060 --> 00:06:32.660
What reason?

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.463
That means side, side, side.

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:42.020
And that's just the argument
that you use in your geometry

00:06:42.020 --> 00:06:45.500
class to say that all
three sides of both

00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:47.910
triangles are congruent.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:50.340
This means that you have an
angle, an angle, and a side.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.570
This means that you have an
angle, and then the side

00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:54.010
between the two angles.

00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.360
And then the next angle that
all of those are congruent.

00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.130
And this says that one of the
sides and the angle, and the

00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:00.340
other side, that those
are congruent.

00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:01.530
We'll probably run
into those in the

00:07:01.530 --> 00:07:02.330
next couple of questions.

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:05.520
But anyway, this shows that
all three sides of both

00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:06.690
triangles are equal.

00:07:06.690 --> 00:07:12.630
And then so, we could say
by the side, side, side

00:07:12.630 --> 00:07:16.730
reasoning, I'm not that
good with terminology.

00:07:16.730 --> 00:07:19.230
By the side, side, side
reasoning, these are both

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:20.500
congruent triangles.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:23.820
And I said, that's one of the
ways of thinking about a

00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:25.540
congruent triangle, is that all
the sides are going to be

00:07:25.540 --> 00:07:28.150
the same length.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:29.400
Next question.

00:07:33.260 --> 00:07:34.510
All right.

00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.590
In the figure below, AB
is greater than BC.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:49.740
OK, so this side is greater
than that side.

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:52.830
Although the way they drew it,
they all look the same.

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.760
So let's see what we can do.

00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.250
If we assume that measure of
angle A is equal to measure of

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:19.030
angle C, it follows that
AB is equal to BC.

00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.510
AB is equal to BC.

00:08:22.510 --> 00:08:25.150
And I don't know if you've run
into this already, but you

00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.910
learned that if you have two
angles that are congruent, or

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.030
if the measures are the same.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:31.480
This is essentially saying
that angle A is

00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.950
congruent to angle C.

00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.230
They instead just wrote it as
that the measures of the

00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:36.690
angles are equal.

00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:38.570
That's what the definition of
congruence is, is that the

00:08:38.570 --> 00:08:40.539
measures of the angles
are equal.

00:08:40.539 --> 00:08:45.940
You could have written angle
A is congruent to angle C.

00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.440
But anyway, if you have two
angles that are equal, then

00:08:50.440 --> 00:08:52.670
the sides that are opposite
those angles are

00:08:52.670 --> 00:08:53.960
also going to be equal.

00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:55.750
So this side right here
is going to be

00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:57.010
equal to that side.

00:08:57.010 --> 00:08:57.980
And that's what they
wrote here.

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.830
It follows that AB
is equal to BC.

00:09:01.830 --> 00:09:03.160
Fair enough.

00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:07.180
Then they say this contradicts
the given statement that AB is

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:09.760
greater than BC.

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.880
Right, it says, it follows that
AB is equal to BC and it

00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:14.680
contradicts this statement.

00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:16.140
Where are they going
with this?

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:19.705
What conclusion can be drawn
from this contradiction?

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.100
Let's see, measure of
angle A is equal to

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:26.350
measure of angle B.

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:33.830
No, that's not the case.

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:34.900
I can think of an example.

00:09:34.900 --> 00:09:37.450
These can both be 30
degree angles.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:41.430
If these are both 30 degree
angles, add up to 60, then

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.840
this would have to be 120 for
them to all add up to 180.

00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:45.550
And it would completely
gel with

00:09:45.550 --> 00:09:46.490
everything else we've learned.

00:09:46.490 --> 00:09:48.280
So, A is definitely not right.

00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:51.560
That A does not have
to be equal to B.

00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:54.680
Measure of A does not equal
the measure of angle B.

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.670
Well, they could, right?

00:10:00.670 --> 00:10:03.770
All of these angles could
be 60 degrees.

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:06.380
We haven't said that B
definitely does not equal A.

00:10:06.380 --> 00:10:07.970
This could be 60, that
could be 60, and so

00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:08.790
could this be 60.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:12.530
And we'd be dealing with an
equilateral triangle.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.100
So I don't think that's
right either.

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:19.070
Measure of angle A is equal
to measure of angle C.

00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:27.560
I see what they're
saying here.

00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.330
Sorry, and this is my bad.

00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:32.350
They're saying, AB is definitely
greater than BC.

00:10:36.920 --> 00:10:41.800
Now, they said if we assume
that measure of angle A is

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.630
equal to measure of angle
C, it follows that

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:45.260
AB is equal to BC.

00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:47.550
They didn't say that this
is definitely true.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.520
They just said that if we assume
that this is true.

00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:53.990
But they didn't say this
is a definite case.

00:10:53.990 --> 00:10:55.710
And that's where the
contradiction came.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:58.690
Because if we assumed it,
then AB could not be

00:10:58.690 --> 00:11:00.540
greater than BC.

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.700
Because then AB would
equal BC.

00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:05.590
So now I see what
they're asking.

00:11:05.590 --> 00:11:07.040
So this is an assumption.

00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:09.070
This isn't actually
proven to be true.

00:11:09.070 --> 00:11:11.920
So this contradicts the given
statement that AB is

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.130
greater than BC.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:14.410
Right, that's true.

00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:17.640
What conclusion can be drawn
from this contradiction?

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:21.000
So we made the assumption that
the measure of angle A is

00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.290
equal to the measure
of angle C.

00:11:22.290 --> 00:11:24.740
That follows that these two
sides are equal, which

00:11:24.740 --> 00:11:26.840
contradicted the given
statement.

00:11:26.840 --> 00:11:29.790
Therefore, we know that the
measures of these two angles

00:11:29.790 --> 00:11:31.710
cannot be equal to each other.

00:11:31.710 --> 00:11:35.220
Because if they were, then we
would contradict the given

00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.310
assumption.

00:11:36.310 --> 00:11:39.440
So, we know from the
contradiction that the measure

00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:44.580
of angle A cannot equal the
measure of angle C.

00:11:44.580 --> 00:11:46.490
And we can't make that
assumption because it leads to

00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.390
a contradiction.

00:11:48.390 --> 00:11:52.620
So the correct answer is D.

00:11:52.620 --> 00:11:55.900
All right, I'll see you
in the next video.
