LAWRENCE CHANG:
Welcome to our session,

00:00:03.940 --> 00:00:06.120
The Future of Apps and Search.

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:08.822
My name is Lawrence Chang
and this is Jason Douglas.

00:00:08.822 --> 00:00:10.530
We are Google product
managers, and we're

00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:14.460
so happy that you guys
are joining us here today.

00:00:14.460 --> 00:00:16.530
So we have a lot to talk about.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:21.550
It all boils down to just
a couple simple things.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:24.280
How can you make
search-friendly apps

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:26.820
so that Google can help
drive installs and discovery

00:00:26.820 --> 00:00:29.060
of your applications,
as well as engagement

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:29.990
of your applications?

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:31.948
So I'm going to start
off by talking about what

00:00:31.948 --> 00:00:33.910
we think it is a
huge opportunity.

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:36.820
I'll talk about how you can get
app discovery through a Google

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.670
search, as well as how can
you engage users with your app

00:00:39.670 --> 00:00:42.710
through app indexing
in our new API.

00:00:42.710 --> 00:00:44.430
And then Jason's
going to come on stage

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.010
and talk a little bit more
about Knowledge Graph,

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:49.930
as well as our actions and
how that can help as well.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:53.360
So if this looks good to you,
make yourself comfortable,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.650
and stick around.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:57.810
So let's get started.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:00:59.850
Now the mobile app
ecosystem has really

00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:01.870
taken off for the
past few years.

00:01:01.870 --> 00:01:04.390
There's over one million apps
in the Google Play store,

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:06.500
and every year,
on average, users

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:09.790
are installing more and more
applications to their devices.

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.140
Now, as you all know,
it's getting harder

00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.340
for your applications
to be discovered

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:18.402
and to reengage users.

00:01:18.402 --> 00:01:20.610
We're seeing that people
are installing applications,

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:23.970
and then using them once,
and forgetting about them,

00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:25.720
and then not using them.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:29.010
So what can we do about that.?

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.300
Well, we think Google
search can help.

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:35.260
So let's take a quick
look at the web.

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.760
This year, the web
is on track to exceed

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:40.930
one billion unique host names.

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:42.290
One billion.

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.360
Now even at this scale,
search and search

00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:49.650
friendly websites
are working together

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:52.620
to already solve this
big problem of discovery

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:54.240
and engagement.

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:59.160
And we think we can do the
same thing for search and apps

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.640
that are search-friendly.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.940
And that's what's so
exciting to us about this.

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:05.075
It really feels like we're
just getting started.

00:02:05.075 --> 00:02:06.950
And there are so many
things we can build on,

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:08.840
that we've already
done with Web Search,

00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.910
and apply it to applications.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:14.880
So let's start with
that discovery.

00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:18.460
So I wanted to talk
about a scenario.

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:21.120
Last weekend, I was at the
California Academy of Sciences

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.160
with my family, and we went
to the Steinhart Aquarium.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.392
Got to see the
Philippine coral reef.

00:02:26.392 --> 00:02:27.475
We got to see some sharks.

00:02:27.475 --> 00:02:28.650
And so I thought,
hey, it might be

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:30.660
cool to install some
wallpaper on my phone.

00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:34.990
So imagine that I'm searching
for shark live wallpaper,

00:02:34.990 --> 00:02:40.820
and you'll see in Google Search
results, application results,

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.640
right there, all
clustered together.

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.510
So we started doing
this last December,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.750
clustering app search
results, and making

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:48.880
them more prominent in Google.

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:51.350
When you tap on any one
of these particular apps,

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:54.170
then you go to Play store,
and from here, very easy

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:56.520
to go ahead and install
the application.

00:02:56.520 --> 00:03:00.770
Now we initially launched
this just for US English only.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:03.070
And this year--
this week-- we're

00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:05.650
really happy to say
that this feature is

00:03:05.650 --> 00:03:06.940
now available globally.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.850
So whether you're searching
for applications in Japanese,

00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:15.080
in Spanish, in Russian,
or in other languages,

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:17.130
you're going to start
to see more application

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:20.120
results in Google Search.

00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:23.820
Now how can you make sure you
get your application actually

00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:26.890
shows up this cluster of
applications in Google.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:29.890
Well, let's talk a
little bit about that.

00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:32.440
So a lot depends
on your Play store

00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:33.630
page for your application.

00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:40.020
So this is where it might be
not intuitive to some of you.

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.330
So I asked Matt Cutts.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.830
So Matt Cutts is the our
head of Webspam at Google.

00:03:44.830 --> 00:03:47.150
So I said, what can
I tell you about how

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:49.780
to see if your content could
show up in a Google Search.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.967
He told me to tell
you three things.

00:03:51.967 --> 00:03:52.550
So here we go.

00:03:52.550 --> 00:03:56.300
The first thing, basic tips.

00:03:56.300 --> 00:04:00.560
Think about when a user is
looking for your application.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:03.889
What are the words that
they're typing on their screen?

00:04:03.889 --> 00:04:05.680
And just make sure that
some of those words

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:08.330
are in the description
for your application.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.200
So very intuitive things.

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.060
Now number two, make sure
that your app's Play store

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.150
page is well-linked.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:17.600
So as an example, if
you have a home page,

00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:19.571
if you have a website
for your application,

00:04:19.571 --> 00:04:21.029
and you have a home
page, just make

00:04:21.029 --> 00:04:26.010
sure you're linking to your
Play page from your website.

00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:31.190
Number three, don't
overdo number one.

00:04:31.190 --> 00:04:34.090
Don't stuff your description
with all kind of keywords

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:34.685
and so on.

00:04:34.685 --> 00:04:36.060
At the end of the
day, it's going

00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.070
to harm you more
than it'll help you.

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.860
But these are some
basic rules of thumb

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:43.430
you could follow to make
sure your app can show up.

00:04:46.290 --> 00:04:49.360
Now, we've been
working a lot on making

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.439
sure the right apps show
up at the right time.

00:04:51.439 --> 00:04:52.980
But in certain
situations we're still

00:04:52.980 --> 00:04:54.930
not triggering applications.

00:04:54.930 --> 00:04:56.320
And so here's an example.

00:04:56.320 --> 00:04:58.690
I actually have a
75-gallon marine aquarium.

00:04:58.690 --> 00:05:00.290
And after going
to the Cal Academy

00:05:00.290 --> 00:05:02.500
I realized, oh, my aquarium
is in terrible shape.

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.520
It's so dirty.

00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:06.100
Probably because I've been
spending so much time on Google

00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:07.760
I/O preparation.

00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.230
So I want to do some searches
on aquarium maintenance.

00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:13.230
And so if I do a query
in Google today, actually

00:05:13.230 --> 00:05:15.110
I don't see any app results.

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:18.076
But what you can do, is if
you go to the search tools

00:05:18.076 --> 00:05:20.534
and click on applications, then
you could refine your query

00:05:20.534 --> 00:05:22.960
in the same way that you refine
your queries for images, and so

00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:23.370
on.

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:24.540
And what you can do is,
you can refine your queries

00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.090
for applications,
and you'll actually

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.160
see application results there.

00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:31.217
And this also works
on desktop as well.

00:05:31.217 --> 00:05:32.800
So if you're on a
computer, and you're

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:35.050
searching for applications,
you can use Search Tools

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:38.280
and actually look for
applications that way as well.

00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.850
And we're spending
some time trying

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:42.950
to make sure we improve the
quality of the applications--

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.780
the ranking of
applications that show up.

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:47.150
And on desktop you also
have some additional tools

00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:50.640
that you can use to
filter the results.

00:05:50.640 --> 00:05:54.790
Now, we also are trying
to make it really easy,

00:05:54.790 --> 00:05:57.270
if users have a specific
application in mind

00:05:57.270 --> 00:06:00.097
that they want to find, to make
it easy for users to discover

00:06:00.097 --> 00:06:01.430
and to actually install the app.

00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.196
So if you search for,
Houzz Android app,

00:06:03.196 --> 00:06:05.070
the Houzz application
is a great application.

00:06:05.070 --> 00:06:07.260
All kinds of creative
ideas for home

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.540
renovations and decorations.

00:06:08.540 --> 00:06:12.119
And maybe I want to figure out
how other people have displayed

00:06:12.119 --> 00:06:13.410
their aquariums in their homes.

00:06:13.410 --> 00:06:15.790
And so I search for
that Houzz Android app,

00:06:15.790 --> 00:06:18.210
and now you'll see at the
very top of search results

00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.220
an answer card.

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:19.930
Pretty prominent.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:21.030
It says, here's the app.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:22.210
Go ahead and install
it from Google Play.

00:06:22.210 --> 00:06:24.730
It makes it very easy for you
to go ahead and install it

00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:26.500
from Google Play.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.170
So let's talk next
about app engagement.

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.910
Now app engagement, right
now, is mainly app indexing.

00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:35.880
How do you get deep links
to your applications

00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:37.380
from Google Search results.

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:45.400
And so let me show you a
demo of that right away.

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:51.140
So, a couple of weeks ago, I
saw some really interesting

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:54.750
headlines about sharks.

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:58.080
There is this super
predator of the ocean,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.970
and scientists basically had
tagged a great white shark,

00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.207
a nine-foot shark, off
the coast of Australia

00:07:03.207 --> 00:07:04.290
and they were studying it.

00:07:04.290 --> 00:07:05.600
They were tracking it .

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:09.420
And suddenly, one day, it look
like something had basically

00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:12.582
chased down the shark
and devoured it whole.

00:07:12.582 --> 00:07:14.040
So scientists are
somewhat baffled.

00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.640
Like, what could have happened?

00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.100
Is it a giant squid?

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.600
Who knows?

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.224
So for years, they weren't
sure what this-- what happened.

00:07:20.224 --> 00:07:21.765
So they dubbed it
the super predator.

00:07:21.765 --> 00:07:26.340
So let's do a search for
the super predator here.

00:07:26.340 --> 00:07:28.474
Do a query for the
super predator.

00:07:28.474 --> 00:07:29.140
And here you go.

00:07:29.140 --> 00:07:30.550
Here's my search results.

00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:32.930
Now, let's actually check
out the first result.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:35.720
It happens to be a website
from the Smithsonian channel.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.935
You click on this, and you
see that there's actually

00:07:38.935 --> 00:07:42.010
a show about the super predator,
"Hunt for the Super Predator."

00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.760
And you can find out some
more information about that.

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.050
Further down, you'll
see, oh look at that.

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:49.280
Here's an application result
for the Huffington Post.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:51.492
It's an application I have
installed on my phone.

00:07:51.492 --> 00:07:53.200
How do I know it's an
application result?

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.350
Well, look at the green
text below the title.

00:07:56.350 --> 00:07:59.040
We call this the visible
URL line actually.

00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.730
And so for websites,
you'll normally

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.170
see a URL there-- a web URL.

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.040
In this particular
case, we've replaced it

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.990
with the name of
the application.

00:08:06.990 --> 00:08:08.680
We've also added the app icon.

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.300
So this tells the user, look
if you click on this result,

00:08:11.300 --> 00:08:13.258
it's going to go directly
into the application.

00:08:13.258 --> 00:08:14.530
So let's do that.

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:16.330
So I tap on the link.

00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:18.926
And it deep links directly
into the Huffington Post app.

00:08:18.926 --> 00:08:20.800
And see, you could read
some more information

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.366
about this bizarre mystery of
what happened to the shark.

00:08:24.366 --> 00:08:25.380
And so on.

00:08:25.380 --> 00:08:28.530
Now, if you want to go
to the website instead,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:31.470
you can tap on the open
Huffington Post link here,

00:08:31.470 --> 00:08:33.780
and you would go to
the website instead.

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.970
And so here, we're actually
opening up the website.

00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:37.305
Oops, Let me do Always.

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.169
And there's the website.

00:08:41.169 --> 00:08:43.419
So it's possible, still, for
you to get to the website

00:08:43.419 --> 00:08:45.746
if you would like.

00:08:45.746 --> 00:08:46.245
Click here.

00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:53.360
Let me go back here.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:57.470
Now, conceptually it's a
very subtle visual change

00:08:57.470 --> 00:09:00.490
from our previous deep linking
UI, where the title link now

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:03.970
goes to the app, but
functionally it's

00:09:03.970 --> 00:09:04.970
pretty significant.

00:09:04.970 --> 00:09:07.240
Though a lot of users
tend to use that title

00:09:07.240 --> 00:09:08.500
link quite a bit.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:11.970
So we expect this will
drive much more engagement

00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:14.987
of your application
than our previous UI.

00:09:14.987 --> 00:09:17.320
As you scroll through the
results, you'll see, oh, look,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:18.590
there's web results.

00:09:18.590 --> 00:09:20.298
And oh, look, there's
another app result.

00:09:20.298 --> 00:09:22.690
And this one's for IMDB-- IMDB
app that I have installed.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:23.839
So I don't think any more.

00:09:23.839 --> 00:09:25.630
Like, do I want to
search for this in IMDB,

00:09:25.630 --> 00:09:26.940
do I search in the
Huffington Post app,

00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:28.220
you just search from Google.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:31.140
And very quickly we can jump
into two apps, three websites,

00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.440
all with the same query.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:35.990
So, it takes the
burden off the user,

00:09:35.990 --> 00:09:37.500
and it makes a
seamless experience

00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:39.051
between apps and the web.

00:09:39.051 --> 00:09:41.300
Now, the other thing I wanted
to point out about this,

00:09:41.300 --> 00:09:44.030
is that philosophically,
there's a big difference.

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.157
So for the first time,
we're treating apps

00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:47.740
that you have installed
on your device

00:09:47.740 --> 00:09:51.317
with the same level of
prominence as websites.

00:09:51.317 --> 00:09:52.900
So this, we think,
ultimately is going

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:55.100
to have a pretty
big impact on how

00:09:55.100 --> 00:10:00.330
we can drive engagement
of your applications.

00:10:00.330 --> 00:10:05.249
So what do you
need to do in order

00:10:05.249 --> 00:10:06.540
to participate in app indexing?

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:13.120
So far, we're very happy
to had the opportunity

00:10:13.120 --> 00:10:15.400
to work with a number of
early adopters for this.

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:18.320
We announced this
past December, working

00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.190
with a handful of developers.

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:22.925
And we want to thank them
for all their hard work

00:10:22.925 --> 00:10:24.270
and for working with us on this.

00:10:24.270 --> 00:10:26.794
It's helped to smooth
out the rough edges

00:10:26.794 --> 00:10:28.210
and give us the
ability to support

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.960
a wider variety of applications.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.830
Now we'd also like to
thank everyone else

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:33.556
for your patience, because
we know that some of you

00:10:33.556 --> 00:10:34.340
have been waiting for this.

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:35.631
There's been a lot of interest.

00:10:35.631 --> 00:10:37.130
So thank you for your patience.

00:10:37.130 --> 00:10:40.280
And we're so happy that we were
able to announce yesterday,

00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.220
at Google I/O, that now app
indexing is open to all Android

00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:45.310
developers globally.

00:10:45.310 --> 00:10:48.420
So if you follow
our guidelines--

00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:52.279
[APPLAUSE]

00:10:52.279 --> 00:10:53.820
If you follow our
guidelines, then we

00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:57.660
can get deep links to your
applications in our search

00:10:57.660 --> 00:10:58.720
results.

00:10:58.720 --> 00:11:01.270
So how do you do this?

00:11:01.270 --> 00:11:02.840
What are the steps
you need to take?

00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.500
How do you make your app
more search friendly?

00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.350
So let's talk a little
bit more about that.

00:11:06.350 --> 00:11:08.910
Three steps, basically.

00:11:08.910 --> 00:11:11.460
Three simple steps to get
started with app indexing.

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.240
The first one, your app needs
to support deep linking.

00:11:14.240 --> 00:11:16.230
Second, we ask
you to verify what

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:17.730
the official website
is of your app.

00:11:17.730 --> 00:11:19.146
And third, you
just basically need

00:11:19.146 --> 00:11:21.660
to specify, what are the
links that your app supports.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.020
So I will talk a little
bit about each of these.

00:11:24.020 --> 00:11:29.049
First, with deep linking, you
have a couple of options here.

00:11:29.049 --> 00:11:31.090
You can choose an HTTP
scheme or a custom scheme.

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:34.170
By HTTP scheme what we mean
is, if your app supports

00:11:34.170 --> 00:11:37.650
the same web URLs that
your website supports,

00:11:37.650 --> 00:11:40.150
that's what we mean
by HTTP scheme.

00:11:40.150 --> 00:11:42.420
If you want to create a
completely different scheme as

00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:43.670
well, you can do that as well.

00:11:43.670 --> 00:11:44.950
And we refer to that
as a custom scheme.

00:11:44.950 --> 00:11:46.366
So let's talk about
we need to do.

00:11:46.366 --> 00:11:49.040
First, your Android
manifest file.

00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:50.670
You need to update that.

00:11:50.670 --> 00:11:52.980
Now, you find the main
activity of your application,

00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.610
and you have to add
an intent filter.

00:11:55.610 --> 00:11:58.340
Now the intent filter needs
to have a couple of settings.

00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:02.150
You need to specify that
the action type is a view.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:03.900
And you need to specify
the categories are

00:12:03.900 --> 00:12:05.700
browsable and default.

00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.500
And you need to do that
for whatever scheme

00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:08.760
that you choose.

00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:11.150
Now, if you want
to use HTTP based--

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:14.080
like a web URL scheme,-- you
need to specify the data scheme

00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:15.520
as HTTP.

00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.030
And then your host as-- at
example.com in this case,--

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.830
your host would be
your web domain.

00:12:20.830 --> 00:12:22.669
And then whatever path
you have beyond that.

00:12:22.669 --> 00:12:24.460
Now if you want to
support a custom scheme,

00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:26.330
you specify the scheme.

00:12:26.330 --> 00:12:28.520
In this case it would
be example://gizmos,

00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.100
your scheme would be example,
and your host, in this case,

00:12:31.100 --> 00:12:32.550
would be gizmos.

00:12:32.550 --> 00:12:37.330
Now, as I mentioned
before, the intent filter

00:12:37.330 --> 00:12:39.039
is specified for a
particular activity.

00:12:39.039 --> 00:12:40.580
So whenever the
operating system sees

00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.220
that someone's clicking
on a link of these formats

00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:47.460
that you've just a specified,
it'll launch this activity.

00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.200
And so let's look
at that activity.

00:12:49.200 --> 00:12:51.851
If you don't add any code
there, then basically any

00:12:51.851 --> 00:12:53.600
link that you have
would launch-- anything

00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.690
that fits those patterns
will launch the activity.

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.984
But if you want to deep link
to something specifically,

00:12:57.984 --> 00:12:59.900
and you want your app
to do something special,

00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:01.980
then you need to add some code
to actually parse the intent

00:13:01.980 --> 00:13:02.896
to do the right thing.

00:13:02.896 --> 00:13:04.870
So here's just a
very simple example.

00:13:04.870 --> 00:13:07.500
You could basically get
the intent, get the data,

00:13:07.500 --> 00:13:10.080
parse it, create a new intent,
and start another activity.

00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:12.000
And you could do this to kind
of figure out where app goes.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.660
Developers do this
in other ways.

00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:16.770
Some developers create what they
consider a trampoline activity.

00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:19.110
So the intent comes
in, and they actually

00:13:19.110 --> 00:13:20.980
send it to the cloud,--
to the back end,--

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:23.335
figure out where they
want to send the content,

00:13:23.335 --> 00:13:25.460
and send a message back to
the app, and from there,

00:13:25.460 --> 00:13:26.190
have the app do the right thing.

00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.694
So a lot of this depends on
the architecture of your app

00:13:28.694 --> 00:13:29.860
and how you want to do this.

00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:31.490
And we won't go
into too much detail

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.720
beyond that at this
particular point in time.

00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.289
But that's what it takes to
support deep linking your app.

00:13:36.289 --> 00:13:38.080
And this is one of the
most important steps

00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:40.934
to make a search-friendly app.

00:13:40.934 --> 00:13:41.600
The second step.

00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:45.230
This step is what I think is
the easiest step of them all.

00:13:45.230 --> 00:13:47.000
And I think it's
the easiest thing

00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:51.374
that anyone has asked you to do,
I think, at all of Google I/O.

00:13:51.374 --> 00:13:53.040
And so, you could do
it now if you want.

00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.680
If you wanted to-- some
of your laptops out-- you

00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:56.000
could actually do this now.

00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:57.810
So what do you need to do?

00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:00.380
Just go to the Play
console when you sign in.

00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:02.401
And after you sign in,
go to the application

00:14:02.401 --> 00:14:04.150
that you want to sign
up for app indexing,

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:06.000
or participate in app indexing.

00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.390
And then you look for the
Services &amp; API section.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:11.700
On the Services &amp; API
section you scroll down,

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:14.150
you look for app indexing
from Google Search, and then

00:14:14.150 --> 00:14:17.310
the Verify Website button.

00:14:17.310 --> 00:14:19.380
All you do, you click the
Verify Website button,

00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.780
then you type in
the domain, and then

00:14:21.780 --> 00:14:23.340
if you have a
separate webmaster,

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:24.680
then you basically wait.

00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:28.280
If you're your own webmaster,
then you go to Webmaster Tools,

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.020
you sign into Webmaster Tools.

00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.900
You'll get a message
from the Google Play

00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:34.126
store asking you to
approve this request.

00:14:34.126 --> 00:14:35.500
All you do is
accept the request.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.215
And that's it.

00:14:36.215 --> 00:14:37.810
As simple as that.

00:14:37.810 --> 00:14:40.610
Now, what's kind
of neat about this

00:14:40.610 --> 00:14:44.990
is if you choose web URL
so as the linking scheme

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:47.300
for your app, based
out of HTTP, then we

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:49.107
can actually start
the indexing process.

00:14:49.107 --> 00:14:51.190
So this is a shortcut to
get the indexing started.

00:14:51.190 --> 00:14:52.170
Well, how does it work?

00:14:52.170 --> 00:14:53.860
We've indexed your website.

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:56.030
So we know the web URLs
that your website supports.

00:14:56.030 --> 00:14:58.760
So we basically take those links
and we start the app indexing

00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:00.510
process.

00:15:00.510 --> 00:15:03.094
And so this is a way
for you to get it going.

00:15:03.094 --> 00:15:05.010
So if anyone asks you,
have done app indexing,

00:15:05.010 --> 00:15:07.720
you can say yes, we've done it.

00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.170
But, you should still
follow up with step three.

00:15:11.170 --> 00:15:13.377
Step three regardless
of if you support HTTP,

00:15:13.377 --> 00:15:15.960
or if you support custom scheme,
we still recommend you do it.

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:17.440
And if your using
a custom scheme,

00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.440
this is something you
have to do to let us know,

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:21.369
what are the links
that your app supports.

00:15:21.369 --> 00:15:22.660
So you have a few options here.

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:24.280
I'm going to talk
about the first two.

00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.904
I'll talk about the
third one later on.

00:15:25.904 --> 00:15:28.130
You an add your links
to Website markup.

00:15:28.130 --> 00:15:30.700
You can add your link
to your site map.

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:33.400
So very quickly, it's
one line of code.

00:15:33.400 --> 00:15:36.766
And all the web pages that you
would want deep link to an app

00:15:36.766 --> 00:15:38.201
with.

00:15:38.201 --> 00:15:39.950
And so let's talk a
little bit about this.

00:15:39.950 --> 00:15:42.810
Now, on this line of code,
we ask you to specify link

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:44.100
rel="alternate" tag.

00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:46.054
And it's because
conceptually, it

00:15:46.054 --> 00:15:47.720
has the closest meaning
to what we want.

00:15:47.720 --> 00:15:50.260
It basically says, there's
another representation

00:15:50.260 --> 00:15:52.010
of this particular document.

00:15:52.010 --> 00:15:53.052
You're on a web page.

00:15:53.052 --> 00:15:54.760
There's another version
of this document,

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.734
and it happens to reside
at this next address.

00:15:57.734 --> 00:15:59.150
And so, the other
thing is it asks

00:15:59.150 --> 00:16:01.494
you to specify the address
in a single string.

00:16:01.494 --> 00:16:03.160
And this is important
to us because when

00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:04.659
you think about
the web, everything

00:16:04.659 --> 00:16:06.200
is linked with unique
single strings.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:08.285
So it's much easier
share things and so on.

00:16:08.285 --> 00:16:10.590
So we wanted the
unique single string.

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:13.800
And when you think about
linking and mobile,

00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:16.810
as you probably already
know, it's a bit of a mess.

00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:18.810
All the operating systems
do things differently.

00:16:18.810 --> 00:16:22.117
So if you want to create a
unique address to a document

00:16:22.117 --> 00:16:23.742
or page with an
application, you should

00:16:23.742 --> 00:16:25.155
have to start with
what is the operating

00:16:25.155 --> 00:16:26.321
system you're talking about.

00:16:26.321 --> 00:16:28.890
So in this case, we
specify Android app.

00:16:28.890 --> 00:16:30.654
Once you know it's
Android, well then,

00:16:30.654 --> 00:16:32.570
what's the unique
identifier for applications.

00:16:32.570 --> 00:16:33.664
It's the package ID.

00:16:33.664 --> 00:16:36.080
So you have to specify the
package ID for the application.

00:16:36.080 --> 00:16:37.840
And then, from here,
whatever scheme

00:16:37.840 --> 00:16:40.300
that you chose before, you
specify this scheme-- if it's

00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:44.290
HTTP or your custom scheme--
and then the subsequent path.

00:16:44.290 --> 00:16:45.950
Now we like this
format because we

00:16:45.950 --> 00:16:47.534
think it's very, very efficient.

00:16:47.534 --> 00:16:49.450
We're taking some steps
is to standardize this

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.116
through [INAUDIBLE] and Jason is
going to talk a little bit more

00:16:52.116 --> 00:16:53.120
about that later on.

00:16:53.120 --> 00:16:54.495
If you want to
use site maps, you

00:16:54.495 --> 00:16:57.470
can go and add a similar line,
basically, to your site maps.

00:16:57.470 --> 00:16:59.890
And then you can add it
to your existing site map

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:01.848
and you would update it
through Webmaster Tools

00:17:01.848 --> 00:17:02.980
just as you do today.

00:17:02.980 --> 00:17:05.089
So we've just talked
about the three steps

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.282
it takes, and at this
particular point in time,

00:17:07.282 --> 00:17:08.240
app indexing can start.

00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:11.182
Now, just like the
web, and web indexing,

00:17:11.182 --> 00:17:13.140
it's possible there are
errors within indexing.

00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.560
So, we've added
some tools-- we've

00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:16.143
created some tools--
to make it easier

00:17:16.143 --> 00:17:18.210
for you to diagnose these
errors and to fix them.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:19.460
So they're in Webmaster Tools.

00:17:19.460 --> 00:17:20.900
You sign into Webmaster Tools.

00:17:20.900 --> 00:17:24.021
You go to the website--
the web domain

00:17:24.021 --> 00:17:25.520
that you connected
through your app.

00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.344
I look for the
Crawl Error section.

00:17:27.344 --> 00:17:28.760
In the Crawl Error
section, you'll

00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:32.090
see a new tab, Android app.

00:17:32.090 --> 00:17:33.850
And right there, if
you go below that,

00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.470
you'll start to
see links to URLs

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:39.140
that are having some issues.

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:41.390
And what you could do is you
could tap on these links,

00:17:41.390 --> 00:17:42.931
and we'll actually
show you a pop up.

00:17:42.931 --> 00:17:45.150
We helped you try to
figure out what's going on.

00:17:45.150 --> 00:17:46.780
We explain what we
think the error is.

00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:48.280
And we give you
some recommendations

00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:51.060
for here's what we think
you can do to fix the error.

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:52.941
Now, a couple of things
I want to call out.

00:17:52.941 --> 00:17:54.940
Testing on mobile can be
tricky, especially when

00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:56.689
you're testing these
deep links and so on.

00:17:56.689 --> 00:17:58.860
So we've added a couple
of tools to make it easier

00:17:58.860 --> 00:18:00.693
for you to check these
things on your phone.

00:18:00.693 --> 00:18:03.070
You click on the app URI,
we'll show another pop-up.

00:18:03.070 --> 00:18:04.720
We'll give you a QR code.

00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:07.684
You can take any standard QR
code reader, scan the QR code.

00:18:07.684 --> 00:18:09.850
A web page will open up,
tap that link and that will

00:18:09.850 --> 00:18:12.530
let you just get
into the app directly

00:18:12.530 --> 00:18:15.380
for the URI of interest.

00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.930
Now after you've fixed--
the issues are [INAUDIBLE],

00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:21.240
you can mark as fixed, and that
gives us a queue that we should

00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:23.900
schedule and start
indexing again.

00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:25.830
And so these are the steps.

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:27.870
You've added deep links
to support your app,

00:18:27.870 --> 00:18:30.749
verified the website,
published app deep links,

00:18:30.749 --> 00:18:32.790
and, on an ongoing basis,
you should periodically

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:35.940
check if there's any
errors and so on.

00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:37.750
So let's talk about
the App Indexing API.

00:18:37.750 --> 00:18:38.520
This is new.

00:18:38.520 --> 00:18:41.035
We announced this
yesterday at the keynote.

00:18:41.035 --> 00:18:43.410
And there's a couple of main
benefits to the App Indexing

00:18:43.410 --> 00:18:43.910
API.

00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:47.730
First, the early adopters
that we talked to, some of you

00:18:47.730 --> 00:18:51.920
said to us, you know what,
it would be really nice

00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:55.260
if we can specify the
links to our application

00:18:55.260 --> 00:18:57.515
through the app itself.

00:18:57.515 --> 00:18:58.890
So we don't have
to use a website

00:18:58.890 --> 00:19:01.340
we don't have to use site maps.

00:19:01.340 --> 00:19:05.820
So the App Indexing
API lets you do that.

00:19:05.820 --> 00:19:08.120
Now secondly, there's
another benefit.

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.300
And this benefit
speaks to how you

00:19:11.300 --> 00:19:13.680
can get additional engagement
to your application.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:16.360
So let me show you a demo.

00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.970
So I want to show you-- We were
talking about the California

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:25.510
Academy of Sciences earlier,
and let me do a query for that,

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:29.300
and what you can see
here is on device

00:19:29.300 --> 00:19:33.560
suggestion, an auto-completion
for the Google Earth app.

00:19:33.560 --> 00:19:35.980
The Google Earth app has
implemented the new App

00:19:35.980 --> 00:19:37.490
Indexing API.

00:19:37.490 --> 00:19:40.100
And as I'm doing a query
in Google Search app,

00:19:40.100 --> 00:19:42.600
it offers an
auto-completion for this.

00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.257
And it shows it because
I've spent some time playing

00:19:45.257 --> 00:19:46.340
with the Google Earth app.

00:19:46.340 --> 00:19:48.740
This is something I've
seen before in the Google

00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.796
Search-- in the
Google Earth app.

00:19:50.796 --> 00:19:52.420
So now what happens
is, when I actually

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:55.720
tap on this deep link-- it's a
deep link-- to the Google Earth

00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:58.670
app and it goes directly to the
California Academy of Sciences

00:19:58.670 --> 00:20:00.112
tour that I had seen before.

00:20:00.112 --> 00:20:01.570
So as this is
playing I'll explain.

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.320
One of the cool things
about this building

00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:04.620
is they have a living roof.

00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:06.430
So when you look
at it from the top,

00:20:06.430 --> 00:20:07.950
it looks like it's this field.

00:20:07.950 --> 00:20:10.140
They took sod, they laid
it with all the sod.

00:20:10.140 --> 00:20:12.384
And then they took native
plants and planted it.

00:20:12.384 --> 00:20:14.050
And this has all kinds
of cool benefits.

00:20:14.050 --> 00:20:15.633
It keeps the building
cool, et cetera.

00:20:15.633 --> 00:20:18.540
So this is a neat feature
if actually go visit.

00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:20.440
You should go to the
roof and check it out.

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:22.356
And, of course, as you
actually dive in there,

00:20:22.356 --> 00:20:24.020
you'll see this isn't
an actual field.

00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:27.120
It's actually a
building, et cetera.

00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.270
Here's another example
of the App Indexing API.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.370
So now, if you're
going to go visit

00:20:32.370 --> 00:20:35.946
I would recommend checking
out Patxi's Chicago Pizza.

00:20:35.946 --> 00:20:38.070
My wife and I were from
the midwest, from Michigan,

00:20:38.070 --> 00:20:39.359
and we love our Chicago pizza.

00:20:39.359 --> 00:20:41.400
So if you're going to go,
you can check this out.

00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:43.080
Now, it's Zagat's app.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.690
I've been to this page
in the app before.

00:20:45.690 --> 00:20:49.029
And they've also implemented
the App Indexing API.

00:20:49.029 --> 00:20:51.320
And so as you can see, I did
a query for Patxi's Pizza,

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.830
it showed up as an on-device
auto-completion, tap on it,

00:20:53.830 --> 00:20:57.250
and deep link right back
into the application.

00:20:57.250 --> 00:20:59.724
And it's one of the--
even Zagat thinks--

00:20:59.724 --> 00:21:01.890
it's one of the best
restaurants near the California

00:21:01.890 --> 00:21:02.570
Academy of Sciences.

00:21:02.570 --> 00:21:05.069
So that's an opportunity-- it's
something you can check out.

00:21:11.050 --> 00:21:13.490
So, now Zagat is a
pretty good example,

00:21:13.490 --> 00:21:16.190
because they implement
app indexing already.

00:21:16.190 --> 00:21:19.430
So what that means is they
have deep links in our search

00:21:19.430 --> 00:21:21.630
results to the app.

00:21:21.630 --> 00:21:24.610
Now what the App Indexing
API lets them to do

00:21:24.610 --> 00:21:27.450
is to get additional
engagement by adding deep links

00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.457
to their app from
auto-completions.

00:21:30.457 --> 00:21:32.540
So it's an additional way
you can drive engagement

00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:34.331
for your application
through Google search.

00:21:34.331 --> 00:21:36.170
Now, the API is new.

00:21:36.170 --> 00:21:39.040
It's available in Google
Play Services 5.0.

00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:41.830
And the auto-completion
feature will

00:21:41.830 --> 00:21:45.840
be available in an upcoming
version of the Google Search

00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.600
app rolling out soon.

00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:53.200
So that was a recap of how
you can use Google, create

00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:56.050
a search-friendly application
to get additional discovery

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:58.070
from Google, get
engagement through app

00:21:58.070 --> 00:21:59.502
indexing and the
App Indexing API.

00:21:59.502 --> 00:22:01.460
And now Jason's going to
talk a little bit more

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.030
about some cool things to
do with Knowledge Graph.

00:22:06.149 --> 00:22:07.440
JASON DOUGLAS: Thanks Lawrence.

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:11.650
All right.

00:22:11.650 --> 00:22:15.410
So you've heard how Google can
surface deep links to your apps

00:22:15.410 --> 00:22:17.492
directly from search results.

00:22:17.492 --> 00:22:19.450
And this is made possible
because Google is now

00:22:19.450 --> 00:22:21.990
maintaining an index of the
deep links in your apps,

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:24.420
just as we've always maintained
an index of the deep links

00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:27.170
in your websites.

00:22:27.170 --> 00:22:29.750
But Google also has another
index, a special one

00:22:29.750 --> 00:22:32.160
for the people, places
and things in the world,

00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.560
and we call this index
the Knowledge Graph.

00:22:34.560 --> 00:22:36.720
And we use the Knowledge
Graph, and it's

00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.550
understanding of
the relationships

00:22:38.550 --> 00:22:40.950
between real world
entities, to power lots

00:22:40.950 --> 00:22:43.460
of great new features in search.

00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:45.610
So, for example,
the Knowledge Graph

00:22:45.610 --> 00:22:47.420
is what helps Google
answer a query,

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:51.520
like Imagine Dragons tour,
with not only the web results,

00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:53.160
but an answer card
that conveniently

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:56.610
summarizes the
events in the tour.

00:22:56.610 --> 00:23:00.380
So where do the details
of this tour come from?

00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:03.070
Well, they actually come
from the band's website.

00:23:03.070 --> 00:23:05.870
They added structured
data to their pages

00:23:05.870 --> 00:23:10.620
that actually tell Google what
the specific events in the tour

00:23:10.620 --> 00:23:13.780
are, so that those events can
then be added to the Imagine

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:16.420
Dragons entity in
the Knowledge Graph,

00:23:16.420 --> 00:23:22.080
and finally used as answers
to users' queries in search.

00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.520
If you look really
closely, you can

00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:28.800
see that the structured
data uses vocabulary

00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:31.570
from schema.org.

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:34.320
And this is useful because it
means that not only can Google

00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.940
understand it, but potentially
others can as well.

00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.370
Because schema.org is
a collaborative effort

00:23:39.370 --> 00:23:42.010
between many search engines,
and lots of other folks

00:23:42.010 --> 00:23:44.850
as well, to establish
a common way

00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:48.770
to describe things
with structured data.

00:23:48.770 --> 00:23:49.270
OK.

00:23:49.270 --> 00:23:49.880
That's great.

00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:52.310
But what does this
have to do with apps?

00:23:52.310 --> 00:23:55.440
Well, we've started
to add actions

00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:59.610
from apps to the
Knowledge Graph as well.

00:23:59.610 --> 00:24:02.510
And this is made possible by
combining the structured data

00:24:02.510 --> 00:24:05.130
approach I just
showed you with events

00:24:05.130 --> 00:24:06.730
with the new world
of app indexing

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:08.794
that Lawrence was telling
you about earlier.

00:24:08.794 --> 00:24:10.210
And we've started
this with music,

00:24:10.210 --> 00:24:12.520
and I'd like to
assure that you now.

00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.640
So let's see.

00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:37.280
Too many technical
things going on here.

00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:38.570
All right.

00:24:38.570 --> 00:24:40.760
So since we were talking
about them earlier,

00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:43.020
let's try Imagine Dragons.

00:24:46.686 --> 00:24:48.470
Get this out of the way.

00:24:48.470 --> 00:24:50.780
So while it was nice to
hear about their concert,

00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:53.700
it would actually be nice
to listen to them right now.

00:24:53.700 --> 00:24:54.295
Well I can.

00:24:54.295 --> 00:24:57.560
So you see here a list of the
music apps I have installed.

00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:59.830
And they can play
Imagine Dragons.

00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:02.084
So let's try Spotify.

00:25:02.084 --> 00:25:04.890
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:04.890 --> 00:25:06.050
So it's just that easy.

00:25:06.050 --> 00:25:08.460
A single tap, and it
starts playing my music.

00:25:12.860 --> 00:25:15.380
OK

00:25:15.380 --> 00:25:17.340
So going back--
now I actually have

00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:21.610
a lot of music apps installed,
so to see the full list

00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:23.214
I could expand it.

00:25:23.214 --> 00:25:25.255
And what's important here
is that Knowledge Graph

00:25:25.255 --> 00:25:27.800
will actually remember
whichever service I pick.

00:25:27.800 --> 00:25:31.030
So the next time it will
actually be first in the list.

00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:35.100
So let's try iHeart
Radio this time.

00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:47.640
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:25:47.640 --> 00:25:48.900
So it's super convenient.

00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:53.810
It's a really great way to
get quick access to my music.

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:55.900
But what if I want to
discover new music?

00:25:55.900 --> 00:25:58.439
So, for example, my
daughter is pretty young

00:25:58.439 --> 00:25:59.980
and she's just to
the age where she's

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.260
starting to learn
about pop music.

00:26:02.260 --> 00:26:04.260
And her friends have been
trying to convince her

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:08.075
that there's really only one
act that matters, Katy Perry.

00:26:12.890 --> 00:26:13.950
And so here she is.

00:26:13.950 --> 00:26:15.810
Now my daughter is
also the age where

00:26:15.810 --> 00:26:17.300
it's all about
videos on YouTube.

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:18.980
She watches them all the time.

00:26:18.980 --> 00:26:20.759
So I'm pretty sure
that's what she'd pick.

00:26:20.759 --> 00:26:23.050
But you notice that iHeart
Radio is actually now first,

00:26:23.050 --> 00:26:26.660
because that's what I
had picked the last time.

00:26:26.660 --> 00:26:28.660
But I also know for a
fact that she has probably

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:33.260
seen all of Katy Perry's videos
on YouTube, too many times

00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:36.030
for my taste.

00:26:36.030 --> 00:26:37.020
Oops.

00:26:37.020 --> 00:26:38.670
There we go.

00:26:38.670 --> 00:26:40.370
But she can also use
the Knowledge Graph

00:26:40.370 --> 00:26:42.200
to browse other
artists and see what

00:26:42.200 --> 00:26:44.140
other people have searched for.

00:26:44.140 --> 00:26:46.160
So for example-- again
she's pretty young

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.920
and probably doesn't
even remember

00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:52.190
when Lady Gaga was big,
and might be curious.

00:26:52.190 --> 00:26:54.230
But she can also
flip through, see

00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:55.880
lots of other related
artists of people

00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.210
who searched for Katy
Perry also search for,

00:26:58.210 --> 00:27:00.526
and for each one
of them quickly be

00:27:00.526 --> 00:27:02.025
able to get to their
YouTube videos.

00:27:05.370 --> 00:27:06.100
There you go.

00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:15.730
What'd I do with the clicker?

00:27:15.730 --> 00:27:16.430
Ah, there it is.

00:27:16.430 --> 00:27:16.930
OK.

00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.170
And there we go.

00:27:24.170 --> 00:27:27.220
So now I have instant
access to my music apps

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.610
whenever I search
for music artists,

00:27:29.610 --> 00:27:32.360
or browse for music
artists, on Google.

00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.410
So we launched music
actions last week

00:27:34.410 --> 00:27:36.010
with the following partners.

00:27:36.010 --> 00:27:37.440
And we'll be adding
more partners

00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:41.120
and more kinds of
actions over time.

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.460
So please stay tuned.

00:27:43.460 --> 00:27:45.020
In the meantime,
since many of you

00:27:45.020 --> 00:27:48.119
are developers, let's talk
about how this actually works.

00:27:48.119 --> 00:27:49.660
So the key thing
that we need to know

00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:53.430
is specifically which deep
link plays Imagine Dragons

00:27:53.430 --> 00:27:56.460
automatically in
Spotify, or iHeart Radio,

00:27:56.460 --> 00:27:59.970
or any other service.

00:27:59.970 --> 00:28:01.920
So the way a
service enables this

00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:05.270
is with structured data that
tells Google exactly that.

00:28:05.270 --> 00:28:07.690
What is the specific
deep link that

00:28:07.690 --> 00:28:10.220
enables the listen action
for the music group,

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.650
Imagine Dragons.

00:28:11.650 --> 00:28:14.410
And you can see that deep link
format uses the same as what

00:28:14.410 --> 00:28:16.882
you saw with Lawrence earlier.

00:28:16.882 --> 00:28:18.590
And in fact you can
sort of think of this

00:28:18.590 --> 00:28:20.548
as, this is the deep link
for that Shuffle Play

00:28:20.548 --> 00:28:23.190
button on the screen.

00:28:23.190 --> 00:28:25.700
This extra data is
necessary to tell Google

00:28:25.700 --> 00:28:29.310
exactly what that button
does, and what intent to fire,

00:28:29.310 --> 00:28:33.520
and what it accomplishes
for users, essentially.

00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:35.630
So how is it different
from that link tag?

00:28:35.630 --> 00:28:36.940
Well it's not, really.

00:28:36.940 --> 00:28:39.230
Like I said, it's
just an extension.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.610
The link tag format is
great if all you need to do

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:44.880
is connect a view
in your website

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:49.104
to a view in your app, which
is perfect for search results.

00:28:49.104 --> 00:28:50.770
But if what you're
trying to communicate

00:28:50.770 --> 00:28:53.330
is something a little bit more
sophisticated, like an action

00:28:53.330 --> 00:28:57.160
button, then this extra
data is very helpful.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:02.230
So that's the App Actions in
the Knowledge Graph, which

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:07.390
is made possible with the
new world of app indexing.

00:29:07.390 --> 00:29:09.500
So we talked about a
lot of features today.

00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:11.824
We've covered a lot of ground.

00:29:11.824 --> 00:29:13.240
But there's really
a common thread

00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:16.800
that runs among all of
it, which is that Google

00:29:16.800 --> 00:29:20.930
is a search engine
for apps, too.

00:29:20.930 --> 00:29:23.699
So this means that if users are
looking to discover new apps,

00:29:23.699 --> 00:29:25.115
they that can do
that with Google.

00:29:27.802 --> 00:29:29.260
If there's a search
result that can

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:31.550
be served by an
installed app, Google

00:29:31.550 --> 00:29:34.790
will take them directly to it.

00:29:34.790 --> 00:29:36.720
Or if they're just
trying to find something

00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:38.800
that they saw
recently in an app,

00:29:38.800 --> 00:29:40.175
they can see it in suggest.

00:29:43.070 --> 00:29:46.930
Or to help users accomplish
a task, actions from apps

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:49.155
can surface directly
in the Knowledge Graph.

00:29:52.010 --> 00:29:55.300
So to get started, as
Lawrence was describing,

00:29:55.300 --> 00:29:58.034
you go to the Play
store and sign up.

00:29:58.034 --> 00:29:59.450
And there's a lot
more information

00:29:59.450 --> 00:30:02.650
on
 developers.google.com/app-indexing.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:07.220
And there's also I/O byte videos
for both app indexing, as well

00:30:07.220 --> 00:30:13.250
as schema.org actions, and
even events in Knowledge Graph.

00:30:13.250 --> 00:30:19.720
And I guess there's also
a Q&amp;A session later today.

00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:20.718
Thank you.

00:30:20.718 --> 00:30:26.612
[APPLAUSE]

00:30:26.612 --> 00:30:28.320
LAWRENCE CHANG: I
think we can do it now.

00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:28.860
Right?

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:29.610
JASON DOUGLAS: Oh.

00:30:29.610 --> 00:30:31.340
There's also the booth.

00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:31.840
But, yes.

00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:32.010
We'll take questions now--

00:30:32.010 --> 00:30:33.450
LAWRENCE CHANG: We can
take questions now.

00:30:33.450 --> 00:30:34.830
JASON DOUGLAS: --if people are--

00:30:34.830 --> 00:30:35.746
LAWRENCE CHANG: Sorry.

00:30:35.746 --> 00:30:37.489
We'll do to the 10
minutes of questions.

00:30:37.489 --> 00:30:38.530
And there's Office Hours.

00:30:38.530 --> 00:30:39.220
JASON DOUGLAS: Office hours.

00:30:39.220 --> 00:30:40.053
That's what I meant.

00:30:40.053 --> 00:30:40.990
Not Q&amp;A. Q&amp;A is now.

00:30:40.990 --> 00:30:42.910
Office Hours are at 1:00.

00:30:42.910 --> 00:30:43.630
Is it?

00:30:43.630 --> 00:30:44.210
1:30.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:44.720
Sorry.

00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:46.710
LAWRENCE CHANG: So if
anyone has some questions,

00:30:46.710 --> 00:30:47.510
feel free to stick around.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:30:47.840
Sure.

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.673
Why don't you start?

00:30:48.673 --> 00:30:49.565
JASON DOUGLAS: Sure.

00:30:49.565 --> 00:30:50.940
AUDIENCE: My
question is, are you

00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:53.380
going to be opening
up the Music App

00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:55.610
actions to anyone
who wants to use it?

00:30:55.610 --> 00:31:00.939
And if not, how would one
become a partner to use those?

00:31:00.939 --> 00:31:03.480
JASON DOUGLAS: Well you can give
me your card after the show.

00:31:03.480 --> 00:31:06.700
At the moment, this is a
pilot with specific partners,

00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.529
but we will be expanding
over time as I said.

00:31:09.529 --> 00:31:10.195
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:31:10.195 --> 00:31:12.460
Maybe I'll find you
after the-- thanks.

00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:12.490
LAWRENCE CHANG: Hi.

00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:12.500
Yeah.

00:31:12.500 --> 00:31:13.080
Why don't we go over here.

00:31:13.080 --> 00:31:14.829
AUDIENCE: This looks
like a great solution

00:31:14.829 --> 00:31:18.400
for managing hundreds
of apps on devices.

00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.910
Are you integrated with
Android Wear at this point?

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:22.880
So you can do the app
discovery and deep links

00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:24.104
through Android Wear?

00:31:24.104 --> 00:31:25.020
And launch from there?

00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.450
Or Android Auto?

00:31:26.450 --> 00:31:29.070
The session we just came out of?

00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.820
JASON DOUGLAS: Well,
so any-- I think

00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:37.080
as you've seen in a lot of the
demos-- most of these platforms

00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:39.750
all use Google Search
in various ways.

00:31:39.750 --> 00:31:41.500
And Google Search
is Google Search.

00:31:41.500 --> 00:31:45.119
And this expands
across all of it.

00:31:45.119 --> 00:31:46.160
LAWRENCE CHANG: But yeah.

00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.550
We don't have a demo that.

00:31:48.550 --> 00:31:51.056
And it would make a
lot of sense for us

00:31:51.056 --> 00:31:53.790
to do something like that.

00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:56.360
AUDIENCE: On your config
file, I saw Music Group,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.870
and you said that you index
people, things, and places.

00:32:00.870 --> 00:32:03.319
Is there a canonical list
of groups that we can find?

00:32:03.319 --> 00:32:04.860
Obviously we can't
just make them up,

00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:06.693
because they have to
come from your indexes.

00:32:09.819 --> 00:32:12.360
JASON DOUGLAS: Well so there is
a canonical list in Knowledge

00:32:12.360 --> 00:32:15.700
Graph, but actually just saying
that was a listen action, even

00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:18.395
though it was a string
of Imagine Dragons.

00:32:18.395 --> 00:32:20.270
Google has a lot of
smarts and can figure out

00:32:20.270 --> 00:32:22.115
which Imagine Dragons
that you mean.

00:32:22.115 --> 00:32:22.990
Is that the question?

00:32:22.990 --> 00:32:24.910
AUDIENCE: No, no.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.330
your configuration
there, you said

00:32:26.330 --> 00:32:28.890
this is a type of Music Group.

00:32:28.890 --> 00:32:32.040
So I imagine there are a list
of all these different types

00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:32.650
of things.

00:32:32.650 --> 00:32:33.858
Maybe it's not a music group.

00:32:33.858 --> 00:32:35.690
Maybe it's a conference.

00:32:35.690 --> 00:32:38.060
Where is a conference
is an event.

00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.780
Where do I find that list?

00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.299
JASON DOUGLAS: schema.org.

00:32:41.299 --> 00:32:41.840
AUDIENCE: Oh.

00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:42.400
Perfect.

00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:42.900
Thank you.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:44.824
JASON DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:32:44.824 --> 00:32:45.820
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.850
Out of the four methods
that you showed,

00:32:47.850 --> 00:32:50.800
where apps can
interact with search.

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.730
So in your demos, most of
it was on the search bar,

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:57.610
does it actually work if
I search an app on Chrome,

00:32:57.610 --> 00:32:58.110
let's say?

00:32:58.110 --> 00:32:58.943
LAWRENCE CHANG: Yes.

00:32:58.943 --> 00:32:59.710
It does.

00:32:59.710 --> 00:33:01.560
AUDIENCE: All the
four methods work?

00:33:01.560 --> 00:33:05.030
LAWRENCE CHANG: So if you
go to search in Chrome.

00:33:05.030 --> 00:33:06.700
google.com in Chrome.

00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.850
You have to be signed in.

00:33:07.850 --> 00:33:09.308
If your signed in,
you will be also

00:33:09.308 --> 00:33:11.670
deep linked to applications
from there as well.

00:33:11.670 --> 00:33:14.640
AUDIENCE: And also
the app indexing?

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:15.500
LAWRENCE CHANG: Yes.

00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:16.000
Exactly.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.739
So when we index
your application--

00:33:17.739 --> 00:33:18.280
AUDIENCE: No.

00:33:18.280 --> 00:33:19.230
Not the app aren't indexing.

00:33:19.230 --> 00:33:19.730
Sorry.

00:33:19.730 --> 00:33:20.967
The Indexing API.

00:33:20.967 --> 00:33:22.050
The third method you said.

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:22.305
LAWRENCE CHANG: Oh.

00:33:22.305 --> 00:33:23.550
That one, right now, no.

00:33:23.550 --> 00:33:24.680
It's through the
Google Search app.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:26.350
You'd be searching through
the Google Search app

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.641
to get those [INAUDIBLE] there.

00:33:27.641 --> 00:33:29.860
AUDIENCE: OK thank you.

00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.470
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:33:30.470 --> 00:33:33.160
Romain from France.

00:33:33.160 --> 00:33:36.140
I was wondering, do
you plan to expand

00:33:36.140 --> 00:33:41.630
the deep linking integration
to iOS apps as well?

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:44.326
LAWRENCE CHANG: So today,
when you talked about some

00:33:44.326 --> 00:33:46.250
of the discovery features
earlier on, where

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:48.870
you can look in the
search tools for apps,

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:53.640
we already show iOS
applications there.

00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:56.670
And we're focused, naturally,
right now an Android,

00:33:56.670 --> 00:33:59.900
to make the best
experience we possibly can.

00:33:59.900 --> 00:34:02.970
But our Google users are on all
kinds of different platforms.

00:34:02.970 --> 00:34:04.641
And that's really
important to us.

00:34:04.641 --> 00:34:06.390
But right now, we don't
have anything else

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:08.510
to announce today.

00:34:08.510 --> 00:34:10.120
But it's something
we understand.

00:34:14.850 --> 00:34:16.710
AUDIENCE: So once
we do the search,

00:34:16.710 --> 00:34:20.150
you expect the app should
show the data immediately?

00:34:20.150 --> 00:34:21.263
That's one of the rules?

00:34:21.263 --> 00:34:22.179
LAWRENCE CHANG: Sorry.

00:34:22.179 --> 00:34:23.340
Ask the question one more time.

00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.239
AUDIENCE: If I do a search.

00:34:24.239 --> 00:34:25.745
If I am linking
it to an article,

00:34:25.745 --> 00:34:27.320
say, in my application.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.050
And I click that, so
lets say for IMDB.

00:34:30.050 --> 00:34:30.980
I search for a movie.

00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.563
I click on it.

00:34:31.563 --> 00:34:34.332
It opens the IMDB app
with the movie directly.

00:34:34.332 --> 00:34:36.040
Now all this is
possible, because there's

00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:39.670
an API for a
particular data value,

00:34:39.670 --> 00:34:41.870
like for the movie in
which I can [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:41.870 --> 00:34:44.250
LAWRENCE CHANG: Right now,
we're generating the snippit

00:34:44.250 --> 00:34:47.489
automatically for you
on search results.

00:34:47.489 --> 00:34:49.210
In the case of the
App Indexing API,

00:34:49.210 --> 00:34:50.600
where there's an
auto-completion,

00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:54.408
you do not specify
the title as metadata.

00:34:54.408 --> 00:34:54.949
AUDIENCE: No.

00:34:54.949 --> 00:34:57.750
But what if the data
needs to come as a bundle,

00:34:57.750 --> 00:35:00.020
and I don't have the
data with me immediately.

00:35:00.020 --> 00:35:02.190
Then can I give some
sort of user experience

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:04.130
in terms of saying that
the application needs

00:35:04.130 --> 00:35:05.350
to be downloaded first?

00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:08.514
Or that content needs
to be downloaded first?

00:35:08.514 --> 00:35:09.305
LAWRENCE CHANG: Oh.

00:35:09.305 --> 00:35:10.240
In the application?

00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:10.346
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:10.346 --> 00:35:11.350
In the application.

00:35:11.350 --> 00:35:14.430
So say I search for an article.

00:35:14.430 --> 00:35:15.870
Say the shark article.

00:35:15.870 --> 00:35:18.290
Now you showed the
Huffington Post thing.

00:35:18.290 --> 00:35:21.570
That is a single article which
just came out from a website.

00:35:21.570 --> 00:35:23.760
Or I pulled it from an
API and it displayed it

00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.100
on the Android device.

00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:27.380
But now, if it's
a magazine, it's

00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:29.180
multiple articles
that are [INAUDIBLE]

00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:30.320
into a single magazine.

00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.030
So I cannot just get
a single article.

00:35:32.030 --> 00:35:33.414
I need to--

00:35:33.414 --> 00:35:35.080
LAWRENCE CHANG: You
would need to create

00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.120
a separate deep link, probably
for, each of those articles.

00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:38.930
Right now.

00:35:38.930 --> 00:35:41.289
Then it would have to map,
basically, to your website.

00:35:41.289 --> 00:35:43.080
If your website is
doing something similar.

00:35:43.080 --> 00:35:45.395
AUDIENCE: But not every user
would have it immediately.

00:35:45.395 --> 00:35:46.770
They would still
need to download

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:49.330
that entire set of articles.

00:35:49.330 --> 00:35:51.080
LAWRENCE CHANG: If I
understand correctly,

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.977
I think, your app is going to
pull down the articles, right?

00:35:54.977 --> 00:35:55.560
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:35:55.560 --> 00:35:57.020
It's a bundle.

00:35:57.020 --> 00:35:58.860
It needs to pull down
the entire bundle.

00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:00.480
And then I deep
link each article.

00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:00.960
LAWRENCE CHANG: Yes.

00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:01.330
AUDIENCE: Right?

00:36:01.330 --> 00:36:01.690
LAWRENCE CHANG: Yes.

00:36:01.690 --> 00:36:03.065
AUDIENCE: But how
does the server

00:36:03.065 --> 00:36:06.454
know that this particular bundle
is downloaded for this user.

00:36:06.454 --> 00:36:08.370
LAWRENCE CHANG: I don't
think we need to know.

00:36:08.370 --> 00:36:10.703
All we need to know is that,
for us, all we need to know

00:36:10.703 --> 00:36:14.080
is that the user has
your application.

00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.360
Does that make sense?

00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:17.450
And then, if the user
has your application,

00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.350
and we've indexed the
content application,

00:36:19.350 --> 00:36:21.250
and we have indexed the
content in your web,

00:36:21.250 --> 00:36:23.870
and it's showing up in
Google Search results,

00:36:23.870 --> 00:36:26.540
then it's up to your app
to basically parse out.

00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:29.330
Once we send the user to
you, with the particular link

00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:31.570
that you told us,
it's up to you to have

00:36:31.570 --> 00:36:33.040
your app do the right thing.

00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:34.020
Does that make sense?

00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:35.395
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
but I think there

00:36:35.395 --> 00:36:37.100
are some certain
rules that have to be

00:36:37.100 --> 00:36:37.760
followed for the
app [INAUDIBLE].

00:36:37.760 --> 00:36:38.370
LAWRENCE CHANG: Sure.

00:36:38.370 --> 00:36:39.370
Let's take this offline.

00:36:39.370 --> 00:36:43.119
Lets talk after this, and we can
spend some more time on that.

00:36:43.119 --> 00:36:43.660
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:44.477
My name's Craig.

00:36:44.477 --> 00:36:46.560
This question might be a
little premature as well,

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:50.950
but I guess my question is,
given that, right now, the app

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.880
has to be installed,
do you guys have

00:36:52.880 --> 00:36:55.610
any plans to use this
for promoted placement?

00:36:55.610 --> 00:36:57.740
Or for suggesting
apps to install

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:00.804
that the user hasn't
installed yet?

00:37:00.804 --> 00:37:02.220
LAWRENCE CHANG:
Whell we do have--

00:37:02.220 --> 00:37:03.850
we can start with the
app discovery features

00:37:03.850 --> 00:37:05.000
that I talked about first.

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.666
So if you're searching
for applications,

00:37:06.666 --> 00:37:08.670
we'll surface cluster
results there.

00:37:08.670 --> 00:37:13.480
And we also have
ad formats as well.

00:37:13.480 --> 00:37:16.190
So our ads team
recently announced

00:37:16.190 --> 00:37:17.940
that they have a--
because you can imagine

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.410
the same thing would
make sense to deep link

00:37:20.410 --> 00:37:23.355
from an ad to an application,
the same way it makes sense

00:37:23.355 --> 00:37:25.480
to deep link from search
results to an application.

00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:28.120
And so that's also something
that-- they're out in beta

00:37:28.120 --> 00:37:28.940
right now.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:30.940
There's a mobile
engagement campaign ad

00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:34.286
format that you can go
search for it on AdWords,

00:37:34.286 --> 00:37:35.660
and they're looking
for sign ups.

00:37:35.660 --> 00:37:37.885
So that's another
possibility right now.

00:37:37.885 --> 00:37:38.510
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.130
Thank you.

00:37:39.130 --> 00:37:41.060
LAWRENCE CHANG: Sure.

00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.890
AUDIENCE: Hi my name is Lou.

00:37:42.890 --> 00:37:46.160
So if your app
requires authentication

00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:48.887
how does Googlebot crawl it?

00:37:48.887 --> 00:37:50.720
LAWRENCE CHANG: So,
that's a great question.

00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:52.330
Right now, we don't.

00:37:52.330 --> 00:37:54.275
But we have something
in the works--

00:37:54.275 --> 00:37:55.900
and this was actually
briefly mentioned

00:37:55.900 --> 00:37:59.524
in the keynote
yesterday-- and this

00:37:59.524 --> 00:38:01.190
is something we've
definitely looked at,

00:38:01.190 --> 00:38:04.469
because we understand that
in mobile, a lot more times

00:38:04.469 --> 00:38:06.260
the application developers
are asking users

00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:08.630
to sign in before
they can see anything.

00:38:08.630 --> 00:38:10.947
Whereas on the web,
it's a little less.

00:38:10.947 --> 00:38:12.030
So we definitely get that.

00:38:12.030 --> 00:38:13.988
And one of the things we
have rolling out soon,

00:38:13.988 --> 00:38:18.230
is if an application
supports Google+ Sign-In,

00:38:18.230 --> 00:38:21.289
then you don't have
to do anything else.

00:38:21.289 --> 00:38:23.080
And we'll talk a little
bit more about this

00:38:23.080 --> 00:38:24.962
in the coming months.

00:38:24.962 --> 00:38:26.670
But this was already
announced yesterday,

00:38:26.670 --> 00:38:29.090
so I think I can talk about it.

00:38:29.090 --> 00:38:30.851
So that would
solve that problem.

00:38:30.851 --> 00:38:32.850
So as long as your app
supports Google+ Sign-In.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:37.910
There is another
answer to that as well.

00:38:37.910 --> 00:38:40.415
Some developers have basically
changed the architecture

00:38:40.415 --> 00:38:41.620
of their app as well.

00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:43.604
And so, when you get a
deep link to your app,

00:38:43.604 --> 00:38:45.270
if the user hasn't
signed in, they still

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:48.420
expose a little bit of the
snippet of the content.

00:38:48.420 --> 00:38:50.040
And above that,
they'll ask the user

00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:51.170
to sign in at that
particular point in time.

00:38:51.170 --> 00:38:52.461
And that's another possibility.

00:38:52.461 --> 00:38:53.961
Of course, anyone
could do that now.

00:38:53.961 --> 00:38:55.835
AUDIENCE: Because I've
noticed that Googlebot

00:38:55.835 --> 00:38:58.210
has been crawling a lot
of my app in particular,

00:38:58.210 --> 00:39:00.680
and it's been puzzling
how they've been doing it.

00:39:03.330 --> 00:39:07.360
LAWRENCE CHANG: Well,
one of the things

00:39:07.360 --> 00:39:09.810
that happens that maybe
might be surprising,

00:39:09.810 --> 00:39:11.500
is that there is
things that you're

00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.680
app is doing-- a lot of things
are basically-- whatever

00:39:16.680 --> 00:39:19.590
resources that your app is
pulling from your servers.

00:39:19.590 --> 00:39:21.905
In order for us
to index your app,

00:39:21.905 --> 00:39:23.280
that all needs to
happen in order

00:39:23.280 --> 00:39:25.670
for us to see what's in the app.

00:39:25.670 --> 00:39:27.810
But sometimes it's
a little surprising,

00:39:27.810 --> 00:39:29.720
if you have [INAUDIBLE]
resources and so on.

00:39:29.720 --> 00:39:32.890
But it's not us doing
anything with that.

00:39:32.890 --> 00:39:35.060
It's literally, you
give us the links,

00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:36.490
and that's what we look at.

00:39:36.490 --> 00:39:38.060
We try to open that
link in your app.

00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:39.559
But if your app is
pulling resources

00:39:39.559 --> 00:39:41.660
from all kinds of
different APIs and so on,

00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:43.868
it has to happen in order
for us to see that content.

00:39:43.868 --> 00:39:46.250
But we're not doing anything.

00:39:46.250 --> 00:39:48.280
In terms of anything
else in the data,

00:39:48.280 --> 00:39:50.160
it's just getting
the data to your app.

00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:50.670
Does that make sense?

00:39:50.670 --> 00:39:51.295
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:39:51.295 --> 00:39:52.780
Thank you.

00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:55.560
AUDIENCE: I have the
same content on the web

00:39:55.560 --> 00:39:57.740
and on the app.

00:39:57.740 --> 00:40:01.380
For the deep linking I could use
the same URL for the website.

00:40:01.380 --> 00:40:04.442
I could use a new HTML URL
for the active linking.

00:40:04.442 --> 00:40:05.650
LAWRENCE CHANG: That's right.

00:40:05.650 --> 00:40:06.310
Yes.

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:09.180
AUDIENCE: Or I can
use the custom scheme.

00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.740
So what's the best practice
here, for the indexing?

00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:16.260
LAWRENCE CHANG: Well I
think we would recommend

00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:19.820
you can use-- I do the same
web URL-- the same HTTP URL

00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:22.900
scheme-- for both the
website and the application.

00:40:22.900 --> 00:40:25.066
AUDIENCE: So the
problem I can see

00:40:25.066 --> 00:40:27.790
here is that if you tap
on the website name,

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:29.770
then you would go to the
app directly already.

00:40:29.770 --> 00:40:32.460
So how does Google
distinguish that?

00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.910
Will I get two results on
the Google Search result?

00:40:34.910 --> 00:40:37.420
Or would I get just one?

00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:40.054
Because it's like
the exact same URL.

00:40:40.054 --> 00:40:41.470
LAWRENCE CHANG:
So right now, what

00:40:41.470 --> 00:40:42.928
would happen in
our search results,

00:40:42.928 --> 00:40:44.521
is if the user had
the app installed,

00:40:44.521 --> 00:40:46.520
then it would have been
next to the application.

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:49.140
Your title link would
go to the application.

00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.340
And then the link on the bottom,
would go to your website.

00:40:52.340 --> 00:40:54.220
But it would be the
same link that's true.

00:40:54.220 --> 00:40:56.250
But the difference
is, that link is

00:40:56.250 --> 00:40:59.671
the one that could be
used to go to the website.

00:40:59.671 --> 00:41:01.420
So the top link we're
specifying a package

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:03.500
ID, which is Android app.

00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.010
We're launching your app.

00:41:05.010 --> 00:41:06.590
So it's unambiguous.

00:41:06.590 --> 00:41:09.270
The link on the bottom,
the user can click on it

00:41:09.270 --> 00:41:12.300
and basically they'd
have to set a preference.

00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.470
If they have a browser,
in their browser

00:41:14.470 --> 00:41:16.230
they would have to specify I
want the browser to open this.

00:41:16.230 --> 00:41:17.660
And then it would just open
the browser all the time.

00:41:17.660 --> 00:41:17.730
Go to your web page.

00:41:17.730 --> 00:41:20.150
JASON DOUGLAS: It's also
based on whether the user has

00:41:20.150 --> 00:41:21.410
the app installed.

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:21.730
LAWRENCE CHANG: Yeah.

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:21.950
Right.

00:41:21.950 --> 00:41:23.210
If the user does not
have the app installed,

00:41:23.210 --> 00:41:24.930
it will just to go to website.

00:41:24.930 --> 00:41:26.165
Does that make sense?

00:41:26.165 --> 00:41:26.790
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:41:26.790 --> 00:41:27.936
Thank you.

00:41:27.936 --> 00:41:30.310
LAWRENCE CHANG: But you could
use custom schemes as well.

00:41:30.310 --> 00:41:31.990
And you can do that as well.

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:33.980
AUDIENCE: So do you mean
the best practice is

00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:35.389
using the custom scheme?

00:41:35.389 --> 00:41:36.180
LAWRENCE CHANG: No.

00:41:36.180 --> 00:41:36.680
No.

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:39.230
I mean the reason
why I would recommend

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:42.330
HTTP URL is for, it can help the
indexing process start sooner

00:41:42.330 --> 00:41:44.230
for you.

00:41:44.230 --> 00:41:48.500
So that's one of the reasons
why I'd recommend it.

00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:50.367
But we support both.

00:41:50.367 --> 00:41:52.200
So there are some
situations where you may--

00:41:52.200 --> 00:41:53.810
the other reason
actually-- is if you

00:41:53.810 --> 00:41:58.410
want linking across
Android, it's also easier

00:41:58.410 --> 00:42:00.040
to use HTTP schemes.

00:42:00.040 --> 00:42:01.850
If you want the link
to show up somewhere

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:04.141
else in another Android app,
and someone to click on it

00:42:04.141 --> 00:42:07.399
and go to your app, then HTTP
is better for that as well.

00:42:07.399 --> 00:42:07.940
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:10.820
Thank you.

00:42:10.820 --> 00:42:12.080
LAWRENCE CHANG: Here.

00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:12.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:42:12.800 --> 00:42:15.810
So the HTTP schemes allowed
in the manifest right now

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:19.330
don't really have
complicated Regex's.

00:42:19.330 --> 00:42:21.980
So we'll have something where
we allow deep linking to like

00:42:21.980 --> 00:42:24.520
/shop, but then the website
adds something at like

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.317
shops/policies that
we don't have yet.

00:42:27.317 --> 00:42:29.150
And we haven't found a
good way around that.

00:42:29.150 --> 00:42:30.700
I was wondering if
app indexing will

00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.120
have all those same problems?

00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:34.249
And can you recommend
any way around?

00:42:34.249 --> 00:42:36.790
LAWRENCE CHANG: Actually I think
we do have something for you

00:42:36.790 --> 00:42:37.290
there.

00:42:40.030 --> 00:42:42.627
We just published this in
our guidelines yesterday.

00:42:42.627 --> 00:42:44.460
You're going to be able
to specify some more

00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:48.510
details in a noindex XML file.

00:42:48.510 --> 00:42:49.797
And this is new.

00:42:49.797 --> 00:42:51.880
You can check out our
guidelines for more details.

00:42:51.880 --> 00:42:53.296
But in your Android
manifest file,

00:42:53.296 --> 00:42:57.610
you can specify a link to
an additional XML resource.

00:42:57.610 --> 00:42:59.810
In this resource file,
you could specify,

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.040
don't index these particular
patterns, these links.

00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.260
And it could be a much longer
list of patterns and so on.

00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:08.260
And I think you can get
as detailed as you want,

00:43:08.260 --> 00:43:08.761
effectively.

00:43:08.761 --> 00:43:10.259
And so that way,
when we look at it,

00:43:10.259 --> 00:43:12.230
we will know that the
app doesn't support this.

00:43:12.230 --> 00:43:13.410
So give that a try.

00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:14.720
AUDIENCE: That sounds perfect.

00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:16.177
What's that coming out with?

00:43:16.177 --> 00:43:17.260
LAWRENCE CHANG: I'm sorry?

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:18.634
AUDIENCE: When is
that available?

00:43:18.634 --> 00:43:20.481
LAWRENCE CHANG: It
should be available now.

00:43:20.481 --> 00:43:20.980
AUDIENCE: OK

00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:23.229
LAWRENCE CHANG: So go ahead
and look at our guidelines

00:43:23.229 --> 00:43:25.770
and, to be safe,
give us a few weeks.

00:43:25.770 --> 00:43:28.654
But this is part of what
we're announcing at I/O.

00:43:28.654 --> 00:43:29.320
AUDIENCE: Great.

00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:31.870
Thanks.

00:43:31.870 --> 00:43:32.800
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:35.970
I was wondering what you
guys make of the App Links

00:43:35.970 --> 00:43:38.590
open standard that Facebook
put out a little while ago,

00:43:38.590 --> 00:43:41.030
and if you're planning
to leverage that at all,

00:43:41.030 --> 00:43:43.570
or if it's just a
tangential project.

00:43:46.210 --> 00:43:48.990
LAWRENCE CHANG: So
I think right now,

00:43:48.990 --> 00:43:51.400
in terms of are we using
any of that and so on,

00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:55.660
we're not using any of the app
links, the schema or anything

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:56.170
like that.

00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:00.345
So we're focusing
a lot on the things

00:44:00.345 --> 00:44:02.700
that we've talked about today.

00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:04.741
Android already,
with Android intents,

00:44:04.741 --> 00:44:06.740
lets you do a lot of the
deep linking and so on.

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.406
And so anything that we're doing
to deep link to apps, actually,

00:44:09.406 --> 00:44:12.540
any of you could be
doing, also on Android.

00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.990
But with that, I think
we are working more

00:44:14.990 --> 00:44:18.550
with schema.org right now, from
a standardization perspective.

00:44:18.550 --> 00:44:20.500
So we are definitely
thinking that hey,

00:44:20.500 --> 00:44:22.999
we should be working with
more companies on this.

00:44:22.999 --> 00:44:24.790
But that's currently
the path we're taking.

00:44:27.104 --> 00:44:28.270
Anything else you would add?

00:44:28.270 --> 00:44:29.570
AUDIENCE: I guess,
specifically, in order

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:31.180
to do some sort
of cross platform

00:44:31.180 --> 00:44:33.375
like iOS deep linking, in
addition to Android deep

00:44:33.375 --> 00:44:36.055
linking, are you thinking about
doing anything like App Links?

00:44:36.055 --> 00:44:38.714
Or is that a different
tactic you're going to take.

00:44:41.099 --> 00:44:43.515
LAWRENCE CHANG: So I think
this goes back to iOS question.

00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:48.990
And I have, I think, the same
answer for the iOS question

00:44:48.990 --> 00:44:49.600
there.

00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:54.400
That we recognize that iOS
is an important platform.

00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.930
We recognize we have
users there as well.

00:44:56.930 --> 00:44:59.210
And App Links does propose
some solutions there.

00:44:59.210 --> 00:45:01.500
Is schema.org-- do we have
anything on schema.org yet?

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.450
For iOS?

00:45:03.450 --> 00:45:04.760
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:08.010
LAWRENCE CHANG: Do
we know-- schema.org

00:45:08.010 --> 00:45:11.107
it's Microsoft, Yahoo, Bing.

00:45:11.107 --> 00:45:11.940
JASON DOUGLAS: Yeah.

00:45:11.940 --> 00:45:16.110
In fact, Microsoft has
been using the schema.org

00:45:16.110 --> 00:45:19.010
schema for Windows deep linking.

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:19.510
So.

00:45:19.510 --> 00:45:20.000
We'll see.

00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:20.680
LAWRENCE CHANG: Does that
answer your questions?

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:20.882
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:45:20.882 --> 00:45:21.382
Thanks.

00:45:21.382 --> 00:45:24.470
LAWRENCE CHANG: But, in
general, we think yeah,

00:45:24.470 --> 00:45:27.234
we're focused a lot, right now,
on making a good experience

00:45:27.234 --> 00:45:29.150
from our search results
and search experience,

00:45:29.150 --> 00:45:32.240
but we're generally
happy, though,

00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.404
at the way the momentum
is going in the industry.

00:45:34.404 --> 00:45:35.820
Right I mean more
applications are

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.706
supporting deep
linking, which is great.

00:45:37.706 --> 00:45:39.330
That's one of the
most important things

00:45:39.330 --> 00:45:40.882
in creating a
search-friendly app.

00:45:40.882 --> 00:45:43.090
And to the extent that people
do that with app links,

00:45:43.090 --> 00:45:45.006
in general, that part
of it is quite positive.

00:45:45.006 --> 00:45:46.900
We think the momentum
industry is good.

00:45:50.190 --> 00:45:50.940
JASON DOUGLAS: OK.

00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:51.775
I think we're--

00:45:51.775 --> 00:45:53.150
AUDIENCE: I work
in gaming, and I

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:54.700
was wondering if
you guys have seen

00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:59.680
any good-use cases of deep
linking and app indexing

00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:02.590
with games, in particular?

00:46:02.590 --> 00:46:04.051
LAWRENCE CHANG: Yes.

00:46:04.051 --> 00:46:06.050
Yeah, I think there are
some really, really cool

00:46:06.050 --> 00:46:07.710
applications that
we can do for games.

00:46:07.710 --> 00:46:09.890
I'd love to talk to you
more about that afterwards.

00:46:09.890 --> 00:46:10.919
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:10.919 --> 00:46:11.710
LAWRENCE CHANG: OK?

00:46:14.207 --> 00:46:14.790
Anything else?

00:46:14.790 --> 00:46:15.400
Are we--

00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:17.730
JASON DOUGLAS: Yeah I
think we're in the red.

00:46:17.730 --> 00:46:20.130
LAWRENCE CHANG:
We're in the red.

00:46:20.130 --> 00:46:22.770
Are we OK?

00:46:22.770 --> 00:46:24.860
JASON DOUGLAS: Or is
there not a session next?

00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:25.196
LAWRENCE CHANG: Sorry.

00:46:25.196 --> 00:46:25.870
Go ahead.

00:46:25.870 --> 00:46:28.109
AUDIENCE: If the user
is in search mode,

00:46:28.109 --> 00:46:30.400
and they press on a deep
link, and it takes them inside

00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:31.140
of the app.

00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:33.830
Is the app switch becoming the
equivalent of the Back button

00:46:33.830 --> 00:46:35.380
for a web browser?

00:46:35.380 --> 00:46:38.279
How can we make that more simple
for them to go back and forth?

00:46:38.279 --> 00:46:39.820
Because a search
seems like they have

00:46:39.820 --> 00:46:41.555
to iterate and
change their query.

00:46:41.555 --> 00:46:43.682
JASON DOUGLAS: Didn't
they show some stuff

00:46:43.682 --> 00:46:44.765
about that in the Keynote?

00:46:44.765 --> 00:46:45.819
Or no?

00:46:45.819 --> 00:46:46.360
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:46:46.360 --> 00:46:47.650
LAWRENCE CHANG: Well, sorry.

00:46:47.650 --> 00:46:50.890
I think, in the
case that I showed,

00:46:50.890 --> 00:46:53.650
I went to Huffington
Post, hit the Back button,

00:46:53.650 --> 00:46:56.740
it should have gone back
to the search results.

00:46:56.740 --> 00:46:58.011
I think that--

00:46:58.011 --> 00:46:59.760
AUDIENCE: Are you guys
working on anything

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:03.330
to extract the action intent
to run that in the background

00:47:03.330 --> 00:47:05.320
inside of the Google
Search query results?

00:47:05.320 --> 00:47:07.157
So you could press
play on Spotify,

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:09.115
the Spotify will have
them play in the browser?

00:47:12.020 --> 00:47:13.770
JASON DOUGLAS: I'm not
sure I'm following.

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:14.360
Sorry.

00:47:14.360 --> 00:47:15.210
AUDIENCE: Like a
background intent.

00:47:15.210 --> 00:47:16.730
Like iOS was working
on extensions.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.355
So you can make a call
and have the Spotify app

00:47:19.355 --> 00:47:20.370
play in the background.

00:47:20.370 --> 00:47:22.120
Without having to
[INAUDIBLE] the browser.

00:47:22.120 --> 00:47:23.703
JASON DOUGLAS: All
of the action stuff

00:47:23.703 --> 00:47:26.100
is using the intent system,
so the various capabilities

00:47:26.100 --> 00:47:30.297
of the intent system might
be leveraged over time for--

00:47:30.297 --> 00:47:32.380
LAWRENCE CHANG: Right now,
we're opening your app.

00:47:35.250 --> 00:47:37.070
Maybe the last question.

00:47:37.070 --> 00:47:38.160
AUDIENCE: Real quick.

00:47:38.160 --> 00:47:43.420
Thinking about an app as equal
to a website, I wasn't clear.

00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.920
Would the search
result ever show an app

00:47:45.920 --> 00:47:48.690
that you haven't installed
yet on your device?

00:47:48.690 --> 00:47:53.029
Well, it does today,
actually, through--

00:47:53.029 --> 00:47:55.070
So if you search for
applications, we already do.

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:56.150
It's through your Play store.

00:47:56.150 --> 00:47:57.858
AUDIENCE: But not in
the organic results.

00:47:57.858 --> 00:47:59.450
Just in the app pack?

00:47:59.450 --> 00:48:03.257
LAWRENCE CHANG: Well, I
think about them as similar.

00:48:03.257 --> 00:48:05.090
They're organically
ranked, and they show up

00:48:05.090 --> 00:48:07.280
in our search results.

00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.520
So we do have that.

00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:12.210
So you can find
applications content there.

00:48:12.210 --> 00:48:15.530
But I will say, it's
still very early,

00:48:15.530 --> 00:48:17.102
and there's a lot
more we can do.

00:48:17.102 --> 00:48:18.560
So I think we could
potentially hit

00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.790
a lot more of these
interesting cases.

00:48:19.790 --> 00:48:21.915
Probably the ones maybe
that you're thinking about.

00:48:21.915 --> 00:48:24.289
JASON DOUGLAS: That's one of
the nice things about having

00:48:24.289 --> 00:48:26.340
the equivalence between
the website and the app.

00:48:26.340 --> 00:48:28.000
The user hopefully gets
the best experience,

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.070
whichever state they're in.

00:48:29.070 --> 00:48:31.278
AUDIENCE: What if you only
had an app and no website?

00:48:31.278 --> 00:48:32.670
Would that ever get indexed?

00:48:32.670 --> 00:48:34.480
LAWRENCE CHANG: So
right now, your app

00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:35.830
which show up if you have
a game, for instance.

00:48:35.830 --> 00:48:37.780
Like when you're
searching for Google,

00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:39.180
we'll surface your game.

00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:41.624
And then, I think the Google
Earth example is a good one.

00:48:41.624 --> 00:48:43.290
If you start using
the app indexing API,

00:48:43.290 --> 00:48:45.440
that's one way we can
start driving engagement

00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:47.740
of your application--
of your game.

00:48:47.740 --> 00:48:49.507
And Google Earth
doesn't have a website.

00:48:49.507 --> 00:48:50.132
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:48:50.132 --> 00:48:51.252
Thanks.

00:48:51.252 --> 00:48:53.710
JASON DOUGLAS: Well thank you
guys, so much, for your time.

00:48:53.710 --> 00:48:55.560
Appreciate it.
