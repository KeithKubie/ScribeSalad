thing cuz stuff goes in there I heard

00:03:23.270 --> 00:03:23.280
thing cuz stuff goes in there I heard
 

00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:24.469
thing cuz stuff goes in there I heard
his hand the prices I don't care how

00:03:24.469 --> 00:03:24.479
his hand the prices I don't care how
 

00:03:24.479 --> 00:03:26.180
his hand the prices I don't care how
long it takes it's gonna happen

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:26.190
long it takes it's gonna happen
 

00:03:26.190 --> 00:03:29.449
long it takes it's gonna happen
my theory now cuz uh because it brings

00:03:29.449 --> 00:03:29.459
my theory now cuz uh because it brings
 

00:03:29.459 --> 00:03:32.179
my theory now cuz uh because it brings
up a Turing first yes uh because

00:03:32.179 --> 00:03:32.189
up a Turing first yes uh because
 

00:03:32.189 --> 00:03:35.000
up a Turing first yes uh because
mcgucket brings up also it was in 1982

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:35.010
mcgucket brings up also it was in 1982
 

00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:37.490
mcgucket brings up also it was in 1982
and I think that's when the calendar was

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:37.500
and I think that's when the calendar was
 

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:40.569
and I think that's when the calendar was
and they kept saying thirty years ago uh

00:03:40.569 --> 00:03:40.579
and they kept saying thirty years ago uh
 

00:03:40.579 --> 00:03:43.159
and they kept saying thirty years ago uh
so again there's some sort of connection

00:03:43.159 --> 00:03:43.169
so again there's some sort of connection
 

00:03:43.169 --> 00:03:45.740
so again there's some sort of connection
there if I had to guess because he talks

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:45.750
there if I had to guess because he talks
 

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:49.729
there if I had to guess because he talks
about um you know like past girlfriends

00:03:49.729 --> 00:03:49.739

00:03:49.739 --> 00:03:51.289
about um you know like past girlfriends
stuff like that I had the calendar I

00:03:51.289 --> 00:03:51.299
stuff like that I had the calendar I
 

00:03:51.299 --> 00:03:52.759
stuff like that I had the calendar I
think there's even pictures of woman my

00:03:52.759 --> 00:03:52.769
think there's even pictures of woman my
 

00:03:52.769 --> 00:03:54.740
think there's even pictures of woman my
guess is that he lost somebody like in

years and all that stuff um so a couple
 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.469
years and all that stuff um so a couple
interesting things in the codes here I

00:04:09.469 --> 00:04:09.479
interesting things in the codes here I
 

00:04:09.479 --> 00:04:11.509

ringing some bells even down to watching
 

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:43.230
ringing some bells even down to watching
it on the TV

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.240
it on the TV
 

00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.530
it on the TV
uh and it just looked very very similar

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:46.540
uh and it just looked very very similar
 

00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:50.040
uh and it just looked very very similar
but um I think it's fine you know it's

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.050
but um I think it's fine you know it's
 

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.370
but um I think it's fine you know it's
still enough of its own thing and yeah I

00:05:53.370 --> 00:05:53.380
still enough of its own thing and yeah I
 

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:55.110
still enough of its own thing and yeah I
really like how they took sort of this

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.120
really like how they took sort of this
 

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:59.700
