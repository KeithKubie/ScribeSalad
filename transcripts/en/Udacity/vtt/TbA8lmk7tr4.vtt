00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:03.100
The program must have more than one bug. Let's find out what's wrong with the

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:06.870
syllable calculation. Before we go too far, let's make sure that text is

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.014
actually hello. I'll place the break point in the beginning of syllable

00:00:11.014 --> 00:00:14.693
calculation. I can't place it right here because the declaration of the method

00:00:14.693 --> 00:00:18.810
isn't really a line that you can run. Now, I'll run the program. It still

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:23.766
thinks it's running, so I'll just hit terminate and now I'll run it. Or keep

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:27.294
trying that same sentence, and it stopped and it looks like the text is right

00:00:27.294 --> 00:00:33.605
this time, it's hello. That's good. So, I'll keep stepping. Probably the most

00:00:33.605 --> 00:00:37.610
interesting part is when count gets incremented. So, let's try stepping it till

00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:42.911
that happens. Stepping, stepping, keep going, all right, we're getting closer,

00:00:42.911 --> 00:00:49.091
we're now inside this four, inside the if. We'll step to the next one. Alright,

00:00:49.091 --> 00:00:53.292
and now I'm at count. What is the value of letter right now? If you step until

00:00:53.292 --> 00:00:57.520
count is incremented, right here, what is the value of letter?
