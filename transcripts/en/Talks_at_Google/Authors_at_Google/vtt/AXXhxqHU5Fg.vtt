00:00:02.070 --> 00:00:14.459
&gt;&gt;Nidia: Good afternoon everyone. Welcome
to another Authors@Google talk. I am happy

00:00:14.459 --> 00:00:27.000
to introduce Les McKeown, author of 'Predictable
Success'. Les McKeown has launched and managed

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.029
over 40 businesses and is the co-founder of
an incubation company that helped hundreds

00:00:29.029 --> 00:00:30.769
of entrepreneurs launch businesses, employing
thousands worldwide. This book hit the market

00:00:30.769 --> 00:00:33.390
with a splash and is said to be an incredibly
useful blueprint for any leader who is looking

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:35.559
for sustainable growth. As per tradition,
we will have book signing and a 15 minute

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:38.320
Q &amp; A at the end. We're just waiting for a
book thing to set up. So, with that said,

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.320
let's welcome Les.
[applause]

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:53.590
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Thank you very much, Nidia.
I appreciate it. And thank you for, all of

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:59.399
you for giving some time to be here. I appreciate
it. I want to thank the various folks who

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:08.000
helped me get here. Not the least, Jenny Blake
in her absence, Nidia Landria, and Alyssa.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:17.640
I actually lived for a number of years from
1997 to about 2006 in Marin. So it's a little

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:24.430
bit frightening to realize that when I first
moved here, none of this existed. And now

00:01:24.430 --> 00:01:33.600
I, well, it all exists. It's pretty bewilderin'.
I don't come from these parts as you might

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:42.800
gather from my accent. I'm from Texas. [laughter]
[laughs] I'm from Belfast in Ireland. Belfast

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:48.790
is the part of Ireland that you come from.
You go to Dublin, right? And you come from

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:54.140
Belfast and I've come from Belfast. But I
moved out in 1997 like I said and my accent

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:59.340
has decided not to relocate. So I'm just talkin'
for a little bit for you to get accustomed

00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:07.649
to the cadences of my voice. The word that
you'll have most difficulty with is 'it'.

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:15.940
'It' is a number between seven and nine. [laughter]
But it's also part of a lot of words 'demonstrit',

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:20.900
'ingrati-it'. So if something isn't gelling,
it's because there's an 'it' in there somewhere

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:25.300
or other.
What I want to share with you today as Niddi

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:33.660
mentioned is essentially what's in my book
but I'm gonna prove that nobody needs to read

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.910
a book if you've got 45 minutes and the guy
who wrote it in the same room. [laughs] [laughter]

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:45.080
A lot of nodding going on. Because [clears
throat] I believe that I'm gonna be able to

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:51.910
communicate to you pretty comprehensively
more or less all that I've covered in there

00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:58.570
because of the fact that it's pretty much
instantly intuitive. I doubt very much if

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:03.450
I'm gonna share with you anything this afternoon
that any of you are gonna think, 'Oh my goodness.

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:08.150
I never knew any of that.' What's gonna happen
is I'm gonna share with you a bunch of stuff

00:03:08.150 --> 00:03:15.950
that you 'll recognize but almost certainly
you hadn't put a name to beforehand. And in

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:20.850
order to do that, I want to share with you
first of all a little bit of background about

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:26.260
myself. Not just because I like talking about
myself. But because I think it's important

00:03:26.260 --> 00:03:32.870
for you to understand where what I am about
to show you came from. Because given that

00:03:32.870 --> 00:03:37.600
I'm aware of the environment in which you
operate every day, what I'm about to say might

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.820
mean that all of you might leave the room
immediately at least mentally if not physically.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:49.560
There isn't a single thing I'm about to show
you that is subject to objective proof. I'm

00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:57.870
gonna show you what I have learned subjectively
over about 36 years or so doing what I do.

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:02.970
That doesn't mean that it doesn't have validity
obviously. But what it does mean is that you

00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.900
need to know the context from which it came
from in order to ascribe whatever validity

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:12.600
you might put to it.
I qualified in the UK originally. This is

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:16.699
something I tried to keep a secret but unfortunately
the people that published the book actually

00:04:16.699 --> 00:04:20.630
slapped it on the box. So I've had to start
to 'fess up to it again. I'm actually a CPA

00:04:20.630 --> 00:04:25.320
by training or a chartered accountant which
is the somewhat posh name we give ourselves

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:33.570
back in the UK. A CPS. And I qualified as
a CPA not because I had any interest in CPA-ing

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:39.200
in terms of doing the legacy work of accounts
and tax and so forth. It was because I had

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:49.100
a freakishly developed interest in business
as a kid. I, I, I can't explain it. It's just

00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:54.970
something weird that happened in my DNA at
some point. And I wanted to understand how

00:04:54.970 --> 00:04:58.460
businesses worked. And somebody gave me a
really good piece of advice which was, 'If

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:03.120
you understand the numbers, then 90% of everything
else will flow from there.' Now I'm gonna

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.850
show you in a moment or two why that's not
true but it was a good starting point. By

00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:14.370
the way, I hope you'll forgive me. I'm not
going to do any Power Point. Is that okay

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:19.260
with you? [audience chuckles] I'm not gonna
switch the lights off and flick at anything.

00:05:19.260 --> 00:05:24.930
I'm, I'm beta testing a brand new technology.
I have downloaded everything I know about

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:30.830
the topic into these four small output devices
[audience chuckles] and I'm amazingly able

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:35.870
to access randomly whatever part of whatever
I want to share with you at any point and

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:41.560
it'll appear here as opposed to doing some
linear display up on the screen. And what

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:48.890
I'll show you in a moment or two began to
evolve as the result of the work I did when

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:55.110
I was in practice. What I started to do pretty
early on was to advise people on launching

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:59.860
businesses which was a ridiculous thing to
do because I didn't know anything about launching

00:05:59.860 --> 00:06:06.050
businesses. But I happened to be working in
Northern Ireland at a time when there was

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:12.090
a, a very strong interest in launching indigenous
local businesses, largely because there was

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:16.560
such a high unemployment rate. There were
very few other options for other people. And

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.270
I was fascinated by this. So a number of people
were brave enough, dumb enough, something

00:06:22.270 --> 00:06:29.991
enough to allow me to take my financial understanding
and try to help them build a business that

00:06:29.991 --> 00:06:37.270
would succeed. Now of course you could pretty
quickly be able to work out what as an accountant,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:42.270
I was brainwashed, sorry trained, to understand
was the most important thing in a business.

00:06:42.270 --> 00:06:45.401
What do you reckon that might be?
&gt;&gt;male #1: Money.

00:06:45.401 --> 00:06:49.350
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Money, cash, profits. The numbers,
the green, the dollar. All that sort of stuff.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.460
Let's call it the finance. If the finance
was right, everything else would follow. And

00:06:53.460 --> 00:07:00.020
so I worked very, very hard at trying to help
people understand that if we could get their

00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:04.130
cash flow right, their balance sheet right,
their P and L account right, everything else

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:11.790
would follow. And that worked pretty well.
I got to be very good at what I do. I got

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:16.030
first place in the accounting exams that I
took. And to this day, just lookin' around

00:07:16.030 --> 00:07:20.010
the room, there may not be enough of you who
are old enough to remember this. But you may

00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.670
recall a couple of years ago, these printed
books came out. I think they were sort of

00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:28.600
laser printed with dots and if you twisted
them a certain way in a strange light and

00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:33.340
did weird things with your eyes, a dolphin
would leap out at you. Or a building would

00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:38.700
appear. These 3-D representations. Well that's
sort of what happens when I look at a set

00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:44.450
of financial statements. I can see the business.
It, it, it becomes a three dimensional thing.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:50.680
And that comes out of all of that work I did
helping launch businesses. Now to fast forward

00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.610
real quick by the time I was 35, I had on
my account or with other people launched 42

00:07:56.610 --> 00:08:00.770
businesses.
Nothing spectacular; a specialist publishing

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:06.000
company, a tool and die manufacturing company,
probably an entire industry that barely exists

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:12.639
these days. Excuse me. I owned, I bought and
operated the Master License for Pizza Hut

00:08:12.639 --> 00:08:18.919
in Ireland which was great fun trying to sell
flat Italian breads to Irish people. [audience

00:08:18.919 --> 00:08:23.850
chuckles] We had no destination restaurants
then. There was no, there was no McDonald's.

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:27.620
There was no Wendy's. There was no Burger
King. There was nothing. We were the first

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:33.690
thing that was a destination branded restaurant.
And to this day you can still go to the first

00:08:33.690 --> 00:08:36.310
Pizza Hut that I opened in a little town called
Carryduff.

00:08:36.310 --> 00:08:41.430
And it's the only Pizza Hut in the world so
far as I am aware that is allowed to manufacture

00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:45.839
and sell fries. The only way we could get
our compatriots to buy pizza was if they could

00:08:45.839 --> 00:08:50.880
get potato in some form along with it. And
in fact, many people at the start when we

00:08:50.880 --> 00:08:55.400
tried to spin the concept of choosing toppings,
wanted to know if chips as we call it was

00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:03.339
one of the toppings. So I had a lot of fun
with that and, but even as a dumb Irish guy

00:09:03.339 --> 00:09:10.720
which is my solid qualification, after you've
done something 40 something times with two

00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:16.589
really painful failures, you begin to see
some patterns, okay? And one of the patterns

00:09:16.589 --> 00:09:21.990
that I saw, in fact the most prominent pattern
that I saw was that a successful business

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:28.740
wasn't just about the numbers. It was about
the numbers, sure. It didn't, it did no harm

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:35.640
to get the business well financed, right?
But it was at least equally important that

00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.790
you got the right people. In other words,
you could throw as much money as you wanted

00:09:40.790 --> 00:09:48.020
at the wrong team and a bunch of idiots can
keep spending your money, right? And the first,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:52.420
stripping out the reference, the totally unnecessary
reference to idiots, we could go back to the

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:57.740
first dot com boom and see that that happened
a lot. A lot of money was thrown at businesses

00:09:57.740 --> 00:10:03.800
that spent it, went up in flames. There might
have been a perfectly good business idea underneath

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:09.290
that or not. You wouldn't know. On the other
hand, really good groups of people I discovered

00:10:09.290 --> 00:10:14.500
could launch highly successful businesses
with very little money. We call it 'bootstrapping''

00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:20.430
these days. But ideally you'd want them both
to be the same. You'd want good finance, good

00:10:20.430 --> 00:10:29.180
team. That seemed to me to be the best combination.
So at that time when I was about 36, 37, the

00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:34.540
UK government, which was then much more interventionist
in business, came along and asked me and one

00:10:34.540 --> 00:10:40.560
other guy if we would start teaching other
people how to launch businesses. Essentially

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:47.010
what, if you know of them at all, organizations
like Techstar or Y Combinator are doing except

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:52.260
we didn't have a tech only focus. We were
focused on anything that would launch a reasonable

00:10:52.260 --> 00:10:58.149
business. And the reason was simple. The UK
at that point was a branch economy of the

00:10:58.149 --> 00:11:05.490
U.S. by and large and South Korea. We had
GM, Ford, Hyundai, Daewoo, LG, Lucky Gold

00:11:05.490 --> 00:11:11.310
Star. All big employers in those days. But
if Ford took a cold that shut down a plant

00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:15.660
in Liverpool, then 20,000 people would be
out of work. So what the UK government did

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:21.170
was ask myself and this one other guy who
was also a serial entrepreneur would we help

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:25.840
other people launch businesses.
Fast forward another 10 years with 120 people

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:31.880
in a consulting group worldwide. We've launched
about 3,000 businesses off the runway. We're

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:37.940
doing this in, in 13 offices around the world.
And we're just watching these businesses take

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.100
off like fighter planes off a ,whatever that
ship thing is,I'm trying to imagine with this

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:46.720
gesture with my hand what's the name of the
ship that has fighter planes on it.

00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:48.529
&gt;&gt;male #2: Aircraft carrier.
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Aircraft carrier. That's it.

00:11:48.529 --> 00:11:53.580
Okay.
Tortured metaphors -- not good. So [clears

00:11:53.580 --> 00:12:00.090
throat] here's the weird thing. About two
to three years into this phase, this incubation

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:05.260
phase where we're helping people launch businesses,
what do you think might start to happen to

00:12:05.260 --> 00:12:08.010
some of those businesses?
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]

00:12:08.010 --> 00:12:15.140
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Some of them started to tank.
Correct. And this was not a pleasant experience

00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:21.710
for us and certainly it wasn't a pleasant
experience for them. In fact, our remuneration,

00:12:21.710 --> 00:12:26.720
the way we got paid, was largely focused on
job creation numbers. That's the reason why

00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.101
the government agencies were paying us to
help start these private businesses. And every

00:12:33.101 --> 00:12:38.230
time one of them closed, that was a net job
loss and they were trying to do a thing that

00:12:38.230 --> 00:12:43.320
I had to struggle very hard to get my head
around. They were trying to do a thing called

00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:49.110
'taking money back' which is not an idea that
an Irish person really carries around much

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:54.490
in their head. Every pine is a prisoner back
there. But we started to get call backs on

00:12:54.490 --> 00:13:00.190
what we were being paid. It was also, both
intellectually and professionally incredibly

00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:05.930
disheartening. Because we were working on
this twin track of having well financed businesses

00:13:05.930 --> 00:13:10.540
with really good teams. We were doing a lot
of hard work to put good quality teams together.

00:13:10.540 --> 00:13:17.910
[clears throat] And so I got personally obsessed
with trying to understand why these businesses,

00:13:17.910 --> 00:13:22.370
two to three years down the line, despite
fitting our template, were still failing.

00:13:22.370 --> 00:13:26.540
And this was setting aside those businesses
that had a perfectly understandable reason

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:30.900
to fail ;like the market got away from them
or technology changed immediately or they

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:36.240
had an economic headwind or whatever. These
were good businesses run by good business

00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.089
people, well financed and yet still a high
percentage of them,well, it wasn't a high

00:13:41.089 --> 00:13:44.970
percentage but it was a high enough percentage
were starting to fail to bother me. It was

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:49.880
at that point that I moved over to the US.
I sold my share in the, in the business. I

00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:56.050
wanted to focus on nothing but trying to understand
why second stage growth was such a problem

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:59.920
for these businesses. And we'd been doing
work, we had offices here in San Francisco

00:13:59.920 --> 00:14:04.690
and in Toronto and in Boston. I came over
here, took that work over, got a much bigger

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:11.380
area to play with and began to look at solely
trying to understand why this was happening.

00:14:11.380 --> 00:14:16.980
And pretty much,not right away, but six to
nine months at trying to work at this, it

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:22.170
became obvious to me intuitively that there
could only be one other variable. If we had

00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:27.269
the money right and we had good teams, the
only thing that could have changed was the

00:14:27.269 --> 00:14:31.620
structure, the environment within which those
teams were operating, and within which the

00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:37.260
funding was operating too. That something
must be shifting within the structure of the

00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:43.110
business. It also seemed to me likely that
although I was looking at this because I'd

00:14:43.110 --> 00:14:50.560
bumped my nose against this one specific point
of change, call it 'second stage growth',

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:56.209
whatever you want. It seemed to me highly
likely there were other flex points or pivot

00:14:56.209 --> 00:15:01.920
points, call it what you want. And I devoted
really all of the time from '97 through to

00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:07.240
about 2003 trying to get a handle on what
they were. I had this huge database of all

00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:10.510
the businesses that I'd worked with before
and helped launch and I had a lot of people

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:19.339
out here who helped me, at their time and
expense and energy, work at this. And also

00:15:19.339 --> 00:15:22.529
a lot of good people who had done a lot of
good research and work on it beforehand. And

00:15:22.529 --> 00:15:27.950
anyway, here's what I discovered over time.
Now what I'm gonna show you, I'm gonna talk

00:15:27.950 --> 00:15:34.870
about it and explain it in the context of
business and in the context of an organization

00:15:34.870 --> 00:15:40.120
overall. But what I discovered going through
is what I'm about to show you applies to any

00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:45.990
group of two or more people who are trying
to achieve common goals. I have shared this

00:15:45.990 --> 00:15:51.430
with marriage guidance counselors, two or
more people trying to achieve common goals.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:56.399
I've shared it with non-profits, with NGOs,
with divisions, departments, groups, teams,

00:15:56.399 --> 00:16:04.860
soccer leagues, mom and kids, yoga groups,
and Fortune 100 businesses, and mom and pop

00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:09.310
businesses. Any group of two or more people
trying to achieve common goals goes through

00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:14.149
the same seven stages and let me share them
with you.

00:16:14.149 --> 00:16:19.079
[pause]
[draws on board] Let me give this a slightly

00:16:19.079 --> 00:16:28.769
nicer rounded thing. What happens with all
businesses is that they go through seven stages,

00:16:28.769 --> 00:16:36.180
four of which indicated by these wiggly lines,
are clearly points of difficulty. And three

00:16:36.180 --> 00:16:43.680
of which indicated by these rather straighter
lines are theoretically smooth, more smooth

00:16:43.680 --> 00:16:50.420
running. In fact, one of the last difficult
areas is a trap, we'll see that, why that

00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:56.320
is in just a moment or two. But essentially
what happens is that every business, every

00:16:56.320 --> 00:17:03.220
organization, every group that's trying to
get started goes through initially a stage

00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:10.869
that I call 'early struggle'. Pretty self
evident that any organization would go through

00:17:10.869 --> 00:17:15.199
a stage of early struggle. In business terms,
what do you think the struggle is about? What's

00:17:15.199 --> 00:17:17.539
the struggle for? Yeah.
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]

00:17:17.539 --> 00:17:22.611
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: And not just any old customers.
Any particular types of customers do you think?

00:17:22.611 --> 00:17:25.509
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: What's that?

00:17:25.509 --> 00:17:27.549
&gt;&gt;male #2: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Might be.

00:17:27.549 --> 00:17:31.379
&gt;&gt;male #3: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: What's that? Sustainable. Right.

00:17:31.379 --> 00:17:35.279
No longer a point of getting customers that
are one off and dead. Like that's the, your

00:17:35.279 --> 00:17:39.470
uncle who started to sell life insurance story
because he was able to sell it to four people

00:17:39.470 --> 00:17:44.700
in his family but then couldn't sell squat
to anybody else so he didn't have sustainable

00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.109
customers. What else would you really like
these customers to be?

00:17:47.109 --> 00:17:50.549
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: That they pay and pay what?

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:55.409
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: More than you charged. You

00:17:55.409 --> 00:18:01.009
want them to be profitable. See if we can
get a sustainable customer base almost for

00:18:01.009 --> 00:18:06.590
anything if we're prepared to give up profitability.
And it's actually not that hard to get a profitable

00:18:06.590 --> 00:18:14.100
customer base if you don't need sustainability.
Really what this early struggle is all about,

00:18:14.100 --> 00:18:21.320
it's a, it's a race over time to do this.
[draws] Two sources of income. First one is

00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:28.520
our external source: funding, bankers, venture
capitol, selling everything you own, selling

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:36.609
everything your spouse owns, paying off the
divorce, getting Aunt Jenny's 401K. And you

00:18:36.609 --> 00:18:46.429
want to replace that from your profitable,
sustainable income from your profitable, sustainable

00:18:46.429 --> 00:18:52.259
market. [pause] [draws on board] So what this
early struggle about, is all about, is finding

00:18:52.259 --> 00:19:00.109
a profitable, sustainable market. That make
sense? Of course, what's the, what's the fuel

00:19:00.109 --> 00:19:06.739
in the tank at this point? What is it that
this business needs every day to be able to

00:19:06.739 --> 00:19:10.340
keep going along the time axis here? What
does this business need? What's its fuel?

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:16.512
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: It's cash. All right. This

00:19:16.512 --> 00:19:19.940
is all about do we have enough cash to get
through tomorrow and next week and the week

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:28.380
after until we find this profitable, sustainable
market? Now just as a little aside, what do

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:38.619
you think over-funding might do to this race
to find our profitable, sustainable market?

00:19:38.619 --> 00:19:42.059
You get a funky little startup, gets a whole
bunch. Somebody gets really excited about

00:19:42.059 --> 00:19:47.269
it and throws a few million at it and it only
needs 40,000. What do you think it might do

00:19:47.269 --> 00:19:54.070
to the absolute need to find that market?
Will it heighten it or dull it?

00:19:54.070 --> 00:19:57.519
&gt;&gt;male #4: Dull it.
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Sure. We didn't get any closer

00:19:57.519 --> 00:20:03.220
to finding a profitable sustainable market
today but we got new Aeron chairs. Yay. We

00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:11.830
built a new conference room. Yay. One of the
things that happens here is that most organizations,

00:20:11.830 --> 00:20:16.029
as a matter of interest by the way, do you
want to take a stab at the percentage businesses

00:20:16.029 --> 00:20:25.399
that get through early struggle? What do you
reckon? It's about one in five, about 20%.

00:20:25.399 --> 00:20:29.619
The IRS and other record keepers will tell
you that about two-thirds of all businesses

00:20:29.619 --> 00:20:34.159
fail in the first three to five years. But
from my ex-CPA days, what I can tell you is

00:20:34.159 --> 00:20:39.049
that it's a huge number of businesses never
even file with the IRS. They never put anything

00:20:39.049 --> 00:20:45.369
on paper. They, they come up and disappear
before that even happens. So there's a, a,

00:20:45.369 --> 00:20:51.739
really high, forgive me for using this phrase
but it's the way it is, there's a high infant

00:20:51.739 --> 00:21:00.100
death syndrome here. And 80% of all businesses
fail. And those that succeed do so largely

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.470
because they keep their eye on the prize,
yes sir.

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:04.262
&gt;&gt;male #5: Do you mind if I ask you a question?
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Not at all.

00:21:04.262 --> 00:21:13.642
&gt;&gt;male #5: So when you say they fail, is that
'cause they ran out of cash or they couldn't

00:21:13.642 --> 00:21:14.642
[inaudible]? [inaudible] what determined their
failure.

00:21:14.642 --> 00:21:16.889
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: They just don't get to this
point here. They never get the crossover and

00:21:16.889 --> 00:21:26.210
at some point, the source of external funding
just runs out. Yeah. And so we have about

00:21:26.210 --> 00:21:29.970
twenty percent of the businesses that get
through here and the ones that do are the

00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:34.941
ones who keep their eye on that prize. I do
a dumb thing with the businesses that I work

00:21:34.941 --> 00:21:40.340
with where I ask them to actually get a klaxon
or a horn or a bell or something and ring

00:21:40.340 --> 00:21:45.750
it every time something happened that gets
them closer to knowing what their profitable,

00:21:45.750 --> 00:21:51.860
sustainable market is and it's dumb but it
works. Keeps their eyes focused on that. Now

00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:58.119
for those businesses that get through this
early struggle stage, what I discovered is

00:21:58.119 --> 00:22:03.769
they hit this first stage of high growth.
I've given this a really technical term if

00:22:03.769 --> 00:22:11.979
you bear with me. I call this 'fun' 'cause
that's what it is. The fun stage. Why do you

00:22:11.979 --> 00:22:15.770
think it might be fun to be working for a
business that's made it through early struggle

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:22.169
and has survived? It's found its profitable,
sustainable market. Why do you think that

00:22:22.169 --> 00:22:24.890
might be fun?
&gt;&gt;male #6: Because the bad times are over.

00:22:24.890 --> 00:22:29.559
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Yeah. 'Cause it's not early
struggle. Right? This is like not banging

00:22:29.559 --> 00:22:35.480
your head on the wall any more. Oh we stopped
doing that. That's nice. It's great fun because

00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:40.279
it's not like this. At this point here, you've
got this thing in the back of your neck every

00:22:40.279 --> 00:22:46.609
day. Can I meet the payroll at the end of
the month? Can I meet our supplier expenses?

00:22:46.609 --> 00:22:51.070
Are they going to pay us in time to pay that?
Can I juggle this with that? And then some

00:22:51.070 --> 00:22:55.460
day somebody walks in and says, 'Hey. You
know what? We can meet payroll tomorrow.'

00:22:55.460 --> 00:23:00.049
I say, 'No. You've made a mistake. Go check.
There's something wrong with the bank figure.

00:23:00.049 --> 00:23:03.950
That can't be right.' 'No. We can meet payroll.'
And then the next month, you meet payroll

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.139
again. You're bewildered. Three, four months
later, you can actually start to take something

00:23:08.139 --> 00:23:14.309
for yourself. Before you know it, hey we've
got this profitable sustainable market. We've

00:23:14.309 --> 00:23:19.029
made it. We get through early struggle to
where the fun is. To hugely generalize, this

00:23:19.029 --> 00:23:23.830
is sort of three to five years but this is
a massive generalization. Now what happens

00:23:23.830 --> 00:23:30.279
in finance is that the business grows really
fast. Can you think of any obvious reasons

00:23:30.279 --> 00:23:35.290
why this small business might be able to post
double digit growth for a number of years?

00:23:35.290 --> 00:23:42.530
&gt;&gt;male #7: Starting from nothing?
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Starting from 0.001% of the

00:23:42.530 --> 00:23:48.639
market share All we've done is discover the
sustainable market. Now we're mining it and

00:23:48.639 --> 00:23:54.760
so we can get double digit, sometimes triple
digit growth for a period of time. And also

00:23:54.760 --> 00:23:59.099
everybody's so enthusiastic. Everybody's so
pumped up. Everybody's so excited. Everybody's

00:23:59.099 --> 00:24:04.330
so full of belief that you work for fun and
you're walkin' down one side of the street

00:24:04.330 --> 00:24:07.470
and somebody's who knows you is dumb enough
to wave at you from the other side of the

00:24:07.470 --> 00:24:11.529
street. You'll walk over and they'll end up
buyin' whatever you're selling 'cause you're

00:24:11.529 --> 00:24:17.350
enthusiastic and excited and the team is really
focused and we feel like there's a lot we

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:20.889
can do and we don' t have a lot of market
share to start with. So we can grow really

00:24:20.889 --> 00:24:25.600
fast. And this is when the myths, the legends
of the business gets built. This is when we're

00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:31.379
snatching victory out of the jaws of defeat
on like a weekly basis. This is where a customer

00:24:31.379 --> 00:24:37.289
asks for 'X' and we deliver 'two X'. Now we
might deliver it two minutes before it was

00:24:37.289 --> 00:24:43.809
due but we get it done. The customer orders
500 widgets in blue on Friday for delivery

00:24:43.809 --> 00:24:47.739
Monday. We get an e-mail over the weekend
saying, 'We're sorry. We made a mistake. We

00:24:47.739 --> 00:24:52.159
want it in pink.' What do we do? Everybody
gets on their hands and knees and repaints

00:24:52.159 --> 00:24:56.850
these widgets pink. And we get them out there
just about on time. But we're excited. We

00:24:56.850 --> 00:25:04.970
have another story to tell and we go have
a beer bust. It's fun. It's, make sense? Familiar

00:25:04.970 --> 00:25:09.119
with that stage? Now at this point, what's
happening is we've moved away from this emphasis

00:25:09.119 --> 00:25:14.269
on cash for the [clears throat],excuse me,for
the business and fun. What it's all about

00:25:14.269 --> 00:25:22.330
for most businesses is just sell, sell, sell.
It's actually about whatever the core thing

00:25:22.330 --> 00:25:29.600
is the business does. So this is a, if this
is a new hospital, it's about heal, heal,

00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:36.989
heal. [pause] [writes on board] It might be
about code, code, code. Whatever the thing

00:25:36.989 --> 00:25:42.929
that defines us, whatever it is that we do
for most commercial organizations is sell

00:25:42.929 --> 00:25:50.039
it, whatever the thing it is, we do it and
boy, do we do it. And we do it highly, in

00:25:50.039 --> 00:25:58.429
a highly flexible mode. We do it in a way
that's very responsive. It's cool and it's

00:25:58.429 --> 00:26:02.160
fun.
But then what happens is the organization

00:26:02.160 --> 00:26:13.480
hits a stage that's inherent and [pause] natural,
I'm gonna redraw this the way it should be.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:23.100
[pause] And a natural result of fun. The business
is growing fast. And what does that mean is

00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:29.929
likely to be happening to the business as
it grows? Is it getting simpler or less simple?

00:26:29.929 --> 00:26:31.509
What do you reckon?
&gt;&gt;male #8: Less simple.

00:26:31.509 --> 00:26:35.609
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: I'm lobbing some softballs
for the folks who had pizza. The business

00:26:35.609 --> 00:26:43.739
is getting more complex every step up here,
right? And what happens is that, sure as shooting,

00:26:43.739 --> 00:26:52.460
any business that's in fun and grows for awhile
will ultimately hit a stage that I call 'whitewater'.

00:26:52.460 --> 00:27:01.559
A whitewater is a point when the growing complexity
of the business begins to cause us to cause

00:27:01.559 --> 00:27:07.429
errors. We begin to drop the ball. We buy
the wrong product for this customer. We deliver

00:27:07.429 --> 00:27:16.190
this to the wrong place. We don't get the
repainting done from pink to blue. We completely

00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:21.139
screw up the installation of something. Now
of course what happens in the first instance

00:27:21.139 --> 00:27:26.580
is the founder owner group, because it's typically
still the founder owner here, just put it

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:30.759
down to chance. Nidia wasn't in the warehouse
that day. She's the one that does all our

00:27:30.759 --> 00:27:34.799
purchasing. She knows precisely how we do
all of this thing. When she comes back, it's

00:27:34.799 --> 00:27:41.279
fine. But six months later when we discover
that not only is it not just down to Nidia,

00:27:41.279 --> 00:27:46.080
that we actually have a systemic problem.
That the business doesn't have the systems

00:27:46.080 --> 00:27:55.330
and processes necessary to deliver consistent
quality in the face of complexity. What's

00:27:55.330 --> 00:28:01.899
happening here is we not only do but are identified
by our ability to deliver consistent quality

00:28:01.899 --> 00:28:08.129
in the face of simplicity. But here we're
having to learn what it truly means to scale

00:28:08.129 --> 00:28:14.409
the business and truly scaling a business
means delivering consistent quality in the

00:28:14.409 --> 00:28:21.350
face of complexity. Does that make sense?
It means we need something very, very simple,

00:28:21.350 --> 00:28:26.230
very straightforward which are systems and
processes. We gotta put some systems and processes

00:28:26.230 --> 00:28:32.309
in place. And the good news that I get to
give to people in my world is very often I

00:28:32.309 --> 00:28:37.190
go speak to founders/owners who think their
business is dying here. They think this is

00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:42.070
what's happening 'cause this just seems natural.
This is how a business should be. And when

00:28:42.070 --> 00:28:46.899
this whitewater starts to happen, they actually
think they're down here. But what I am able

00:28:46.899 --> 00:28:52.110
to help them with is that if we can put the
right systems and processes in place, we can

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:59.389
actually break through to the stage that I
call 'predictable success' which is like fun

00:28:59.389 --> 00:29:05.840
except you're in control. You can scale the
business indefinitely. You have the systems

00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:11.299
and processes to grow the business to whatever
size you want it to be. Now of course it should,the

00:29:11.299 --> 00:29:15.769
story should stop there and we should all
get our business there and keep it there.

00:29:15.769 --> 00:29:20.080
But the reality is that what happens and I'm
gonna deal with this in a second but really

00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:24.960
quick,but having done a thing that was a good
thing, we put some systems and processes in

00:29:24.960 --> 00:29:28.409
and it got us through whitewater, what do
you think typically we then do if we just

00:29:28.409 --> 00:29:30.570
did a good thing?
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]

00:29:30.570 --> 00:29:35.299
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: More of it or less of it? We
do more of it. And what happens with most

00:29:35.299 --> 00:29:41.659
organizations is we get to the point where
we over-systematize. We put too many systems

00:29:41.659 --> 00:29:47.250
and processes in place and the business begins
to get arthritic and it tilts forward into

00:29:47.250 --> 00:29:53.229
the first of the decline stages which I call
'treadmill'. And a business in treadmill is

00:29:53.229 --> 00:29:57.539
simply that. It is a business where form has
begun to become more important than function.

00:29:57.539 --> 00:30:03.859
Where face time is more important than delivering.
Where filling in checklists is more important

00:30:03.859 --> 00:30:08.419
than the point that the checklist was there
to achieve. Where we just start to go through

00:30:08.419 --> 00:30:18.979
the motions. We're not as committed to shipping,
to delivering, to precision. We've become

00:30:18.979 --> 00:30:26.889
too fixated with efficiency, with the way
in which things are done. And that's a natural

00:30:26.889 --> 00:30:34.619
point. Most organizations swing between here.
That's perfectly fine and high performing

00:30:34.619 --> 00:30:40.109
management teams keep that swing here. Less
well performing management teams allow it

00:30:40.109 --> 00:30:45.400
to go like this. But treadmill is pretty natural.
What's not natural, 'cause what can happen

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:50.380
here in treadmill is that you can recover,
you can recognize what's happened and pull

00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.450
off on the systems and processes and go back.
If you don't do that, however, the business

00:30:55.450 --> 00:31:02.070
falls into what I call 'the big rut'. And
what happens with the big rut, which though

00:31:02.070 --> 00:31:10.210
I've shown like this, actually looks more
like this, because we've technically grown

00:31:10.210 --> 00:31:15.179
a lot of legacy income, we typically have
a monopolistic or near monopolistic position

00:31:15.179 --> 00:31:20.349
by this stage, We're typically a relatively
big organization so we can hang on in the

00:31:20.349 --> 00:31:27.070
big rut for a long time. The difference between
the big rut and treadmill is that in the big

00:31:27.070 --> 00:31:32.539
rut, we've lost the power to self-diagnose.
In treadmill, we know we've over systematized

00:31:32.539 --> 00:31:41.470
and we want to fix it. In the big rut, we
like it that way. Ever been to the DMV? We

00:31:41.470 --> 00:31:47.820
like it that way. And you, the customer, are
getting in our way. I have an educational

00:31:47.820 --> 00:31:53.320
establishment as a client which has been in
the big rut for about 312 years. [audience

00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:59.799
laughs] Okay? The difference between treadmill
which is a natural orange blinking light and

00:31:59.799 --> 00:32:03.929
the big rut which essentially means your business
will die eventually is that in treadmill you

00:32:03.929 --> 00:32:08.899
can self-diagnose and in big rut, you can't.
And once you're in the big rut, it's only

00:32:08.899 --> 00:32:18.190
a question of time before the business hits
what I call 'death rattle'. [pause] And death

00:32:18.190 --> 00:32:24.270
rattle, that's it. Lights are out. The business
will go. There's no recovery from it. Sure

00:32:24.270 --> 00:32:27.839
somebody might come in and buy it all out
of receivership, take the name, take the brand

00:32:27.839 --> 00:32:31.849
and so forth but essentially, it's not gonna
go any further.

00:32:31.849 --> 00:32:37.089
Now what I'd like to finish off with before
taking some questions, and I'm sorry. I appreciate

00:32:37.089 --> 00:32:44.960
that I'm fire-hosing it here a little bit,
but I think it's worthwhile trying to show

00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:52.989
you the full model. What I'd like to share
with you in closing are the underlying key

00:32:52.989 --> 00:32:58.739
dynamics that cause this to happen. Remember
we talked about the financial structure, the

00:32:58.739 --> 00:33:05.899
people, and the underlying organizational
structure. What's essentially happening here

00:33:05.899 --> 00:33:13.129
is this. The management style of the business,
the way in which it is being managed, is essentially

00:33:13.129 --> 00:33:18.269
the key driver of this. Let's go right back
to the outset here in early struggle. What

00:33:18.269 --> 00:33:24.619
do you call the sort of idiot,sorry,person,who
sits at the kitchen table at three am with

00:33:24.619 --> 00:33:28.649
a perfectly good job and says, 'I can't stand
this. I'm gonna start up a new business.'

00:33:28.649 --> 00:33:32.070
What sort of words do we use to describe that
type of person?

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:36.230
&gt;&gt;male #9: Entrepreneurial.
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown. Entrepreneurial. What else?

00:33:36.230 --> 00:33:40.669
What else have they got, do you think?
&gt;&gt;male #10: [inaudible]

00:33:40.669 --> 00:33:41.752
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: What's that?
&gt;&gt;male #10: Passion

00:33:41.752 --> 00:33:45.979
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: They've got a lot of passion.
Yeah. Got a lot of passion. You need that

00:33:45.979 --> 00:33:50.519
passion and enthusiasm to get through early
struggle. Can you see if you don't have that

00:33:50.519 --> 00:33:55.249
with, with this knockout writ, you get knocked
down. You don't have that passion and enthusiasm,

00:33:55.249 --> 00:34:01.649
that vision, you're never gonna see it through.
The visionary,let's put a 'V' up here, the

00:34:01.649 --> 00:34:06.429
visionary is the person,it's the style that
gets the business up and going through early

00:34:06.429 --> 00:34:13.290
struggle. Do you think if you were a funder,if
somebody came to you who was solely a visionary

00:34:13.290 --> 00:34:18.520
and nothing else, would you give them the
money? If all they had was a vision and nothing

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.060
else, what's missing?
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]

00:34:21.060 --> 00:34:26.110
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Somebody's gotta do it, right?
Somebody's gotta do this stuff. So typically

00:34:26.110 --> 00:34:36.330
what happens here is that the visionary gets
the business idea, gets the notion, the concept

00:34:36.330 --> 00:34:41.399
but it's a 'V' and an 'O',an operator. The
person that makes the railroads run on time.

00:34:41.399 --> 00:34:46.180
It's a 'V' and an 'O'. It's a classic mom
and pop but it's also any start up model.

00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:49.441
A 'V' and an 'O' will get the business up
and going. Now it's that 'V' and 'O' that

00:34:49.441 --> 00:34:54.090
push the business through fun. The vision
gets the ideas. The visionary gets the ideas.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:57.800
The operator's out there making it happen.
They're very symbiotic. Can you see they work

00:34:57.800 --> 00:35:04.550
off each other? Visionary's very long term
focused. Operator's short term focused. Visionary's

00:35:04.550 --> 00:35:11.200
thinking things up. The operator is out there
getting it done. Operator is releasing endorphins

00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:17.430
by gettin' stuff done. What use would an operator
be without a visionary? If somebody came to

00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:20.800
you who was just an operator, really good
at getting things done, but had no vision,

00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:27.570
would you fund them? This is the perfect funding
team. Now sometimes it's two people. Sometimes

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:32.960
it's one person who's slightly schizophrenic.
Sometimes it's twelve people and they share

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:41.950
the various roles. Jeff Bezos, Amazon, big
'V', tells a great story about himself with

00:35:41.950 --> 00:35:47.120
his, I think the guy went on to become a Chief
Financial Officer for awhile but was essentially

00:35:47.120 --> 00:35:52.860
in my terms, his 'O'. And Jeff Bezos tells
the story about on their knees in the early

00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:56.070
days in his garage, literally packing books,
which is fascinating when you see those big

00:35:56.070 --> 00:36:02.110
pictures of the Amazon world. Bezos, the 'V'
says to his 'O', 'What do you think about

00:36:02.110 --> 00:36:07.490
this?' And the 'O' says, 'To be honest, we
can't keep going like this.' And Jeff says,

00:36:07.490 --> 00:36:10.869
'No. You're right. We need knee pads.'
[audience laughter]

00:36:10.869 --> 00:36:16.800
'No. Jeff. We need people, tables, chairs,
systems, processes. ' So the 'V' and the 'O'

00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:23.320
take the business up here but as it becomes
more and more complex, you'd think the 'V'

00:36:23.320 --> 00:36:28.410
and the 'O' mindset, this highly effective,
get it done, very flexible, turn on a dime,

00:36:28.410 --> 00:36:36.120
couple are good at putting systems and processes
in place? Nah. They just wanna do it. The

00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:40.060
need the endorphin rush each time.. Let's
get this thing done. And what happens classically

00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:46.540
in whitewater is that a third management style
comes on board and it gets emphasized or somebody

00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:53.340
gets hired in or it gets accentuated and that's
the processor management style. The 'V' and

00:36:53.340 --> 00:36:56.721
the 'O' realize intellectually that we need
to start bringing some systems and processes

00:36:56.721 --> 00:37:03.660
to bear. We really can't get through here
unless and until we've got some systems and

00:37:03.660 --> 00:37:06.990
processes in place but we don't want to do
it so we'll bring other people in and we'll

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:12.860
ask them and we'll heighten them, and we'll
give them a role and tell them to do it. Sounds

00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:23.160
perfect, right? The problem is this is a highly
unstable triad. See, the 'O' by this stage

00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:27.770
here up in fun, laid fun, when all this is
starting to happen, what do you think the

00:37:27.770 --> 00:37:31.370
'O' is spending all of his, who's fixing all
of these mistakes that are beginning to happen?

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:33.100
Is it the 'V' or the 'O'?
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]

00:37:33.100 --> 00:37:37.440
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: It's the 'O'. Of course it
is. The 'V' is having too many more bright

00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:43.400
ideas. So the 'O' has become a firefighter.
The 'O' is firefighting. The problem is, here's

00:37:43.400 --> 00:37:49.470
the arsonist. A lot of the firefighting is
happening because 'Vs' like to walk around

00:37:49.470 --> 00:37:56.130
with a book of matches. Whoosh. Let's open
an office in Mongolia. Whoosh.

00:37:56.130 --> 00:38:01.230
[audience laughs]
Let's invent time travel. Whoosh. [audience

00:38:01.230 --> 00:38:06.530
laughter] And the 'O' is the one that's having
to pull all of this together and fix stuff.

00:38:06.530 --> 00:38:11.010
So originally the 'O' thinks when systems
and processes get elevated, when a 'P' is

00:38:11.010 --> 00:38:17.450
brought in, the 'O' thinks, 'Oh thank goodness.
This is gonna calm everything down.' But who

00:38:17.450 --> 00:38:24.300
does the V think the systems and processes
are for? Let me ask it another way. Who do

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:30.560
they not think it's for? Everybody but themselves.
Because why do people start businesses? Because

00:38:30.560 --> 00:38:35.491
they want autonomy above all else. That's
the number one reason people start businesses.

00:38:35.491 --> 00:38:38.660
It's why the visionaries start businesses.
They want autonomy. And of course everything

00:38:38.660 --> 00:38:45.750
'P' does is like this to the 'V'. The 'V'
and the 'P' in the worse situation can be

00:38:45.750 --> 00:38:50.530
like oil and water. We don't have time to
go into it but it's a highly unstable arrangement.

00:38:50.530 --> 00:38:55.950
So what I've seen, and I'll close with this
in order to take your questions,what I've

00:38:55.950 --> 00:39:02.190
seen in organizations happen a lot is that
often this move into whitewater happens, there's

00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:06.021
an intellectual ascent on behalf of the 'V'
and the 'O' team that really brought the business

00:39:06.021 --> 00:39:12.280
to here. Remember highly effective, highly
flexible, highly fluid, love to do new things.

00:39:12.280 --> 00:39:15.981
They've got a lot of sweat equity together.
They've known each other for a long time.

00:39:15.981 --> 00:39:20.780
The 'P' element comes into the business and
then everything starts to slow down because

00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:26.190
we're starting to put systems and processes
in place. And often what happens is ultimately

00:39:26.190 --> 00:39:29.900
the 'V' and the 'O' feel that things have
even actually got worse. This isn't fixing

00:39:29.900 --> 00:39:33.870
the thing. We want to go back to the way it
was. Let's go back to, we start to talk about

00:39:33.870 --> 00:39:39.770
'back in the day'. We might even start to
talk about 'them' and 'us'. I am of 'V'. I

00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:45.050
am of 'P'. And what happens is that well,
let me ask you. If you think there's a fight

00:39:45.050 --> 00:39:53.600
between these three, who gets ostracized first?
'P'. No sweat equity. No history. And looks

00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.990
like they've caused the problem to get worse
And what I've seen many, many times is that

00:39:57.990 --> 00:40:04.120
organizations actually go in and out of fun
and whitewater, three, four, five times. They

00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:10.230
try this. The 'P' doesn't work out. They go
back down to fun. Grow again back into whitewater

00:40:10.230 --> 00:40:16.610
and back and forward. And what I've seen happen
in those organizations that get to predictable

00:40:16.610 --> 00:40:21.150
success is that although they wouldn't use
this terminology, these three managements

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:26.710
styles which are highly visceral management
styles get added to, get complimented by a

00:40:26.710 --> 00:40:32.370
learned management style. It's a style I call
a 'synergist'. It's not a great word but it's

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:37.710
the best one I can think of. And essentially
what a synergist management style is is a

00:40:37.710 --> 00:40:44.330
realization that we have to have systems and
processes for the long term but they've gotta

00:40:44.330 --> 00:40:50.960
work with the people in our organization and
with our culture. It's the synergist mindset

00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:56.550
that translates for these people that smooths
the way, that enables them to talk to each

00:40:56.550 --> 00:41:02.160
other. And it's that synergist mindset that
appear when we get all four of these working

00:41:02.160 --> 00:41:08.260
together that the organization can stay in
predictable success. And it's when one of

00:41:08.260 --> 00:41:14.740
those begins to feel under pressure and leaves,
or gets pushed down that the organization

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:19.360
comes unbalanced and will either fall backwards
into whitewater or forward into treadmill.

00:41:19.360 --> 00:41:26.610
I promise I'd stop at the 45 minute level
and take some questions. And I'm gonna do

00:41:26.610 --> 00:41:30.210
that. But I hope that's been helpful to you
and that it's been useful. Thanks. Questions?

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:35.770
&gt;&gt;Male Audience Member #11: [speaking with
an Irish accent] I have a couple of questions.

00:41:35.770 --> 00:41:41.080
May I say, one of the other action items,
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: I'm sorry. I don't understand

00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:42.080
a word you're saying. Could you say that again?
[audience laughter]

00:41:42.080 --> 00:41:43.220
&gt;&gt;male #11: A couple of items,there's currently
in Northern Ireland, you might be familiar

00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:50.480
with the health and social care monitoring
system . Medicine is an areas where there's

00:41:50.480 --> 00:41:52.710
a lot of process, unnecessarily so, a lot
of legal liability, et cetera. So you have

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:54.320
service organizations moving into that market
supplying services to government and all the

00:41:54.320 --> 00:42:12.210
other [inaudible] players in the market. How
does this vary by that kind of area because

00:42:12.210 --> 00:42:23.400
a lot of the process that's been put in place
is actually required and is very, very strict

00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:25.290
and it's using a lot of services people that
wouldn't necessarily be able to stand up and

00:42:25.290 --> 00:42:26.940
change the business.
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Yeah. A lot of health and education

00:42:26.940 --> 00:42:32.400
is right here. It's either in the big rut
or it's teetering towards it. Certainly in

00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:38.890
treadmill. And irrespective of the industry,
there are cultural problems that happen. Of

00:42:38.890 --> 00:42:42.990
course what then happens is people come up
with really bright ideas to change the face

00:42:42.990 --> 00:42:48.130
of a wide industry. Btu what they're doing
is they're starting here and they're trying

00:42:48.130 --> 00:42:53.540
to contract with an organization there. Now
so long as the organization there keeps throwing

00:42:53.540 --> 00:43:00.410
lots of money over here, that'll smooth the
thing out. But ultimately what happens is

00:43:00.410 --> 00:43:05.210
this doesn't take because they don't speak
the same vocabulary. The relationship breaks,

00:43:05.210 --> 00:43:09.610
the money flow stops, and these people get
[makes squeezing gesture]. Happens all the

00:43:09.610 --> 00:43:17.300
time. Working within, across a span that wide
is really tough. It's not, it's not, you can

00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:20.630
see organizations working from here to here,
but from here to here is really, really hard.

00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:28.960
There's a lot of, perfectly, there's a whole
industry of I wouldn't say bottom feeding

00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:33.440
firms but that's essentially what they do.
Organizations are quite happy to stay small

00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.940
and be flexible and just picking up little
contracts and make a lot of money. But not

00:43:36.940 --> 00:43:40.150
a lot of medium or long term satisfaction
in that because you're not really changing

00:43:40.150 --> 00:43:50.460
anything. Any other questions, folks? [pause]
Any comments or observations?

00:43:50.460 --> 00:44:13.300
&gt;&gt;Audience Member: [inaudible]
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: That's a really good question.

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:19.800
What I see happen a lot is that organizations
get up to here. When they start to hit treadmill

00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:25.830
and become over processed, it's the 'V' who's
the first one to dislike that. And what they'll

00:44:25.830 --> 00:44:30.520
often do is either they'll say, 'Screw it.
This isn't what I signed up for.' And they'll

00:44:30.520 --> 00:44:35.160
leave and go back to do something else. Or
they'll say, 'Screw it. I don't like the way

00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:38.620
this organization is.' And they'll just take
the business right back to here. Try to return

00:44:38.620 --> 00:44:44.530
to fun. One of the things that I thinks happened
real well in Apple and I don't, I can't prove

00:44:44.530 --> 00:44:49.121
this but I think we'll get the proof of it
in the next couple of years, is that the way

00:44:49.121 --> 00:44:56.501
to really lock in an organization to predictable
success is by institutionalizing the 'V' function

00:44:56.501 --> 00:45:03.020
and depersonalizing it, taking it away from
being the sole, being solely personified by

00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:08.780
one or more people. Now I think Steve Jobs'
done a very good job of in PR terms, putting

00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:12.900
himself out there as the highly obviously,
the big 'V' of Apple but I think what we'll

00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:19.210
discover is that in there, there are a lot
of V's right through the org chart. And that's

00:45:19.210 --> 00:45:23.970
really what locks a business in predictable
success for a very long time is when the 'V'

00:45:23.970 --> 00:45:28.990
role is depersonified. Sure you can continue
to have some 'V' figureheads. But if those

00:45:28.990 --> 00:45:33.010
people have really worked hard at pushing
it down through the organization. So you say

00:45:33.010 --> 00:45:36.650
'this group', 'that group', 'this product
area', 'this geographical area' have all got

00:45:36.650 --> 00:45:40.750
their own 'V', then that really helps lock
predictable success in.

00:45:40.750 --> 00:45:49.250
&gt;&gt;male #12: You mentioned Y-Combinator and
a bunch of [inaudible] and I was wondering

00:45:49.250 --> 00:45:56.370
what you think that says about [inaudible]
and what works and what doesn't in that [inaudible]?

00:45:56.370 --> 00:46:01.900
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: I think first of all that YComm
and Techstars are all doing a great, great

00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:10.450
job. I think anything that helps reduce this
figure is, is super. What I see happen a lot,

00:46:10.450 --> 00:46:16.610
let's set aside whether it's YComm or Techstar
or whatever, but just in tech funding in general,

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:21.880
is that if you blow up the early struggle
thing, you take this bit, just this bit here,

00:46:21.880 --> 00:46:28.290
in fact what happens is that a whole life
cycle happens inside that early struggle,

00:46:28.290 --> 00:46:35.260
that there are two separate things going on.
One is the early stage funding, cash out,

00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:41.970
get to this point here, struggle, issue and
then there's the meta level of what will be

00:46:41.970 --> 00:46:46.400
this business look like 15 years, 20 years,
30 years from now? And so what I see happen

00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:50.570
is that if you were to blow up that early
struggle stage, the business actually goes

00:46:50.570 --> 00:46:55.650
through its own mini-life cycle which is all
about getting the initial funding right, the

00:46:55.650 --> 00:47:02.130
equity right, getting the second stage, getting
my share out and then eventually we get to

00:47:02.130 --> 00:47:07.120
the point where, oh we've just got a normal
business. Let's get going. One of the things

00:47:07.120 --> 00:47:15.450
that can happen which is problematic is that
sometimes external VC money tries to make

00:47:15.450 --> 00:47:21.220
a little startup be this right from Day One.
So they put a Board together. They throw a

00:47:21.220 --> 00:47:27.410
bunch of money at it. They bring the 'P' in
very early on to manage the money. And the

00:47:27.410 --> 00:47:34.970
business can't take the weight of it and it's
the same reason internal fund groups often

00:47:34.970 --> 00:47:40.440
don't work is that sometimes a large organization
will try a little start up but will essentially

00:47:40.440 --> 00:47:44.010
want it to start operating in predictable
success immediately and it's put all these

00:47:44.010 --> 00:47:48.320
resources behind it. The business has got
to grow through these natural stages. This

00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:55.070
choreography of – 'V', 'V O', 'V O P', 'V
O P S' -- you can't skip that stuff and just

00:47:55.070 --> 00:47:57.770
germinate this perfect little business much
as everybody would like to.

00:47:57.770 --> 00:48:04.410
&gt;&gt;male #13: [inaudible] What do you think
are the most critical [inaudible] in that

00:48:04.410 --> 00:48:11.040
small paradigm? What do you think are the
most critical pitfalls that small companies

00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:14.360
[audience member sneezes] [inaudible] trying
to [inaudible].

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:20.580
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Not, not trying to find a long
term profitable sustainable market. Trying

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:26.030
to jigger the numbers to make it look like
something we can hang a valuation on is not

00:48:26.030 --> 00:48:31.960
finding a long term sustainable, profitable
market. Literally finding a, it's fun these

00:48:31.960 --> 00:48:36.781
days and popular to talk about pivots and
changing and shifting. All that is if you

00:48:36.781 --> 00:48:42.940
strip it down is finding a long term sustainable,
profitable market. Anything you do and a lot

00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:49.040
of people I talk to are just using vocabulary
to mystify something which should be very,

00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:53.490
very simple which is what's your product or
service and who's your long term sustainable

00:48:53.490 --> 00:48:57.310
market. And if you can't answer that, you've
gotta go out and answer that and no amount

00:48:57.310 --> 00:49:02.390
of , no prospectus that will get you another
round of funding is going to change the underlying

00:49:02.390 --> 00:49:06.730
dynamic. It may give you more time but you
still gotta find your long term, sustainable,

00:49:06.730 --> 00:49:07.730
profitable market.
&gt;&gt;male #14: [inaudible] What are some of the

00:49:07.730 --> 00:49:23.260
tactics that seem to be A) very successful
and B) be a waste of time to try to get back

00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.930
into the whitewater [inaudible]?
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Yeah and in treadmill there

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:31.990
are four, four key touch points. First is
you gotta look really hard at your hiring

00:49:31.990 --> 00:49:36.470
because in treadmill, hiring becomes an amplifier.
Essentially what's happening in treadmill

00:49:36.470 --> 00:49:42.770
is that the 'P' mindset is running first and
foremost. And so we start to hire people that

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:49.000
got a 'P' preponderance who will confirm,
conform with systems and processes. We hire

00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.580
people who are gonna deliver compliance as
opposed to delivering creativity. So you gotta

00:49:53.580 --> 00:49:58.840
look at your hiring and make sure. 'Cause
hiring is really the water coming into the

00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:03.370
lake. Right? It's the only thing that's gonna
refresh what's there. Secondly the way in

00:50:03.370 --> 00:50:08.450
which you conduct performance assessment.
Typically in treadmill, performance assessments

00:50:08.450 --> 00:50:16.490
begin to become risk and consequence focused.
'What did you not do?' 'What did you fail

00:50:16.490 --> 00:50:20.960
on?' And 'what were the consequences of that?'
as opposed to being focused on 'What did you

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.070
do really well? What did you succeed at? And
how can we bottle that in the organization?

00:50:25.070 --> 00:50:32.000
How can we push that out to wider parts of
the business?' And the two other things are

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.040
the training function. Classically in treadmill,
training has again begun to move towards a

00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:43.190
compliance base. It's begun to become a way
in which you insure that all the boxes are

00:50:43.190 --> 00:50:47.240
ticked and we're covered. Our people have
got, been touched at all these points and

00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:51.030
they know what they should know. And to turn
the training function into something that

00:50:51.030 --> 00:50:58.910
encourages creativity. All the good stuff
that you're doin'. That's three. And mentoring

00:50:58.910 --> 00:51:05.220
and coaching. One of the key things in treadmill
is you've gotta give people an opportunity

00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:10.820
to do things wrong. It's like a golfer whose
swing's gone bad. There's no point trying

00:51:10.820 --> 00:51:15.720
to get him to fix it on the back nine on Sunday.
You gotta get him off to the range and let

00:51:15.720 --> 00:51:20.400
him hit a hundred balls and keep trying stuff
until they get the groove back. And mentoring

00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:25.550
and coaching that takes people off line and
lets them make mistakes is very, very important.

00:51:25.550 --> 00:51:34.640
[pause]
&gt;&gt;male #15: Thank you for your talk. I wonder

00:51:34.640 --> 00:51:45.470
[clears throat] in terms of a stage [inaudible].
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Which stage were you askin'

00:51:45.470 --> 00:51:47.460
me about?
&gt;&gt;male #15: [inaudible]

00:51:47.460 --> 00:51:56.390
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: Tech companies tend to shorten
the left side here and lengthen the right

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:03.320
side. If they get to the right side. And it's
all about money. They get through here faster

00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.030
because they can often get access to more
funding at this size. I hear they can often

00:52:08.030 --> 00:52:13.890
build up more of a war chest than a non-tech
company and so they can slide quietly here

00:52:13.890 --> 00:52:18.250
for a lot longer. And I'm not gonna do it
with a camera here but it wouldn't take too

00:52:18.250 --> 00:52:21.870
hard, too long for us to think of a couple
of companies that started out as tech companies

00:52:21.870 --> 00:52:26.800
that got a massive war chest. And they may
well be certainly in treadmill if not working

00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:31.450
very hard to not have fallen into the big
rut. So accelerated down here and lengthened

00:52:31.450 --> 00:52:36.490
up on this side largely because of revenues,
profitabilities higher than in a manufacturing

00:52:36.490 --> 00:52:40.560
company typically. You can put an awful lot
of your cash away compared to a manufacturing

00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:42.810
company typically.
&gt;&gt;male #16: What about disruptive technologies

00:52:42.810 --> 00:52:47.900
[inaudible]. Cash cows [inaudible] strip that
profit away.

00:52:47.900 --> 00:53:02.720
&gt;&gt;Les McKeown: It may not be exactly the answer
to the question that you want but it sounds

00:53:02.720 --> 00:53:06.260
so good in my head. So I'll give it to you
anyway. I talk in the book about people I

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:11.840
call 'early struggle obsessives'. And early
struggle obsessives often in the tech side

00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:18.070
are people who actually don't have really
any interest even in this stage, they don't

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:22.080
wanna get into anything that's sort of like
a business but what they love to do is find

00:53:22.080 --> 00:53:26.260
a destructive technology and find a way to
monetize it. And then once they've done that,

00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:31.740
they wanna go back and do it again. And soon
I've a lot of friends in Boston who are working

00:53:31.740 --> 00:53:37.410
with three, four, five tech start ups because
it's finding the destructive technology where

00:53:37.410 --> 00:53:42.570
they get their buzz. And once they've done
it, the idea of us getting revenue from a

00:53:42.570 --> 00:53:48.760
customer base, ugh. Freaky. Right? Now what
can sometimes happen is you get that person

00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:54.310
who is more interested in the disruptive technology.
They do it themselves on to somebody who is

00:53:54.310 --> 00:53:58.900
more interested in the business and that can
either be a great success or it can be horrible

00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:04.440
to watch because the early struggle obsessive
is the one that's fixated about the disruptive

00:54:04.440 --> 00:54:09.410
technology can often just get self damaging.
They can begin, in business terms, cut themselves.

00:54:09.410 --> 00:54:13.861
They don't want success so they'll keep trying
to pull the business down. That can get really

00:54:13.861 --> 00:54:22.840
messy, really freaky. Time for one more? [pause]
We're done. Thank you very much indeed.

00:54:22.840 --> 00:54:23.510
[applause]
