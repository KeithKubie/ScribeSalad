00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.670
We know that three
points define a triangle.

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:05.650
So if I were to take
three random points here,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:09.540
so let's call that point
A, point B, and then

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.960
let's say this is point
C right over here.

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.620
If we say that these
three points are

00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:16.940
the vertices of a triangle,
they define a unique triangle.

00:00:16.940 --> 00:00:19.680
So this would be
triangle A-- try

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.486
to draw my lines as straight
as possible-- triangle ABC.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:28.230
Now we've also learned
in the last few videos

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:33.400
that triangle ABC has
a unique circumcenter.

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.700
And that is a point that is
equidistant to these three

00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:40.220
vertices, it equidistant
to these three points.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:42.950
So the way can we can find
it is we draw a perpendicular

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:45.940
bisector of each of
these sides and where

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:47.952
the three perpendicular
bisectors intersect--

00:00:47.952 --> 00:00:49.535
and we show that
they always intersect

00:00:49.535 --> 00:00:52.777
at a unique point-- that
is that circumcenter.

00:00:52.777 --> 00:00:54.610
And I'll do it really
quick right over here.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.620
So let's say that this
is the perpendicular

00:00:56.620 --> 00:01:01.400
bisector of that side, this
is the perpendicular bisector

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:07.610
of that side, and this is
the perpendicular bisector

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:08.780
of that side.

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:12.380
So these are all perpendicular,
this is perpendicular,

00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.820
and they each bisect the sides.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:20.540
B to this point is going to
be equal to this point to A. A

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:23.060
to this point is going
to be equal to that point

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:29.410
to C. C to this point is going
to be equal to that point to B.

00:01:29.410 --> 00:01:32.250
And this point right over here,
we've already talked about,

00:01:32.250 --> 00:01:35.420
we'll call that point O. We
call that the circumcenter.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.260
O is the circumcenter.

00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.310
This is all a little
bit of review.

00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.970
So if you have three points,
you have a unique triangle.

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:47.290
That unique triangle has a
unique circumcenter, which

00:01:47.290 --> 00:01:49.940
is equidistant to the three
points of the triangle,

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.090
three-- I should say the three
vertices of the triangle--

00:01:53.090 --> 00:01:55.850
and that distance
between the circumcenter

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.490
and the three points, the
three vertices, I should say.

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:02.160
So let me draw that
in a different color.

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:09.000
So this distance, OA, the
length of OA, the length of OC,

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.070
and the length of OB,
so OA is equal to OC

00:02:14.070 --> 00:02:17.050
is equal to OB, which
is the c circumradius.

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:24.040
And we've learned when we
first talked about circles,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:26.040
if you give me a
point, and if we

00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:27.830
find the locus of
all points that

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.599
are equidistant from that
point, then that is a circle.

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:34.140
And when I say a locus, all I
mean is, the set of all points.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.690
If you give me any
point right over here,

00:02:37.690 --> 00:02:41.000
so that's an arbitrary point,
and you also specify a radius,

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.100
and say what is the set of
all the points on this two

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:46.820
dimensional plane
that are equidistant,

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:48.990
that are that radius
away from the center?

00:02:48.990 --> 00:02:50.500
It uniquely defines a circle.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:53.530
That's how we defined a
circle right over here.

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.400
And similarly, if
you say, look, if you

00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.970
start with the
center at O, and you

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:01.460
say all of the points that are
the circumradius away from O,

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:03.720
it will uniquely
identify a circle.

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:07.320
And that circle will contain
the points A, B, and C

00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:11.250
because those are the
circumradius away from O.

00:03:11.250 --> 00:03:13.730
So they are included
in that set.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.290
So the circle would
look something

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:18.030
like-- let me draw it.

00:03:18.030 --> 00:03:20.250
It would look
something like this--

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:25.660
trying my best to draw
it, just like that.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:27.180
Everything we've
talked about, just

00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:29.920
now within the last few
minutes, is all review.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:31.020
We know all of this.

00:03:31.020 --> 00:03:33.810
But I went over it just
to kind of reinstate

00:03:33.810 --> 00:03:40.320
a pretty interesting idea, that
if you give me three points

00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.220
that defines a unique
triangle, and if you

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:47.840
have a unique triangle--
And let me make it clear.

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:52.170
This is three
non-collinear points,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:58.250
so three points not
on the same line.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.760
If you have three points that
are not on the same line,

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:02.850
that defines a unique triangle.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:12.480
For any unique triangle you
have a unique circumcenter

00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.642
and circumradius.

00:04:15.642 --> 00:04:17.850
I'll rewrite it, I don't
want to get lazy and confuse

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.860
you-- circumradius.

00:04:21.480 --> 00:04:23.180
And if you give me
any point in space,

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:26.940
any unique point, and a radius,
the set of all points that

00:04:26.940 --> 00:04:28.870
are exactly that
radius away from it,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:30.400
that defines a unique circle.

00:04:35.765 --> 00:04:37.390
So we went through
all of this business

00:04:37.390 --> 00:04:38.931
of talking about
the unique triangle,

00:04:38.931 --> 00:04:41.400
and the unique circumcenter,
and the unique radius,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.310
to really just show you that
if you give me any three

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:51.210
points that eventually, really,
just defines a unique circle.

00:04:51.210 --> 00:04:54.070
So just as you need three
points to define a triangle,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.890
you also need three
points to define a circle,

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.360
two points won't do it.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:02.980
And one way to think about it
is, if you give me two points,

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.615
there's an infinite
number of triangles

00:05:04.615 --> 00:05:06.390
that I construct with
those two points,

00:05:06.390 --> 00:05:08.264
because I could put the
third point anywhere.

00:05:08.264 --> 00:05:10.030
I could construct this triangle.

00:05:10.030 --> 00:05:11.590
I could construct
this triangle, I

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.320
could construct this triangle,
I can construct this triangle.

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:16.820
And all of these
triangles are going

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:19.470
to have different circumcenters
and different radiuses.

00:05:19.470 --> 00:05:22.680
And so they're going to
have different circles that

00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:24.870
circumscribe about
those triangles.

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.450
So this one-- so
for example, this

00:05:27.450 --> 00:05:29.830
would be one circle
that could go around,

00:05:29.830 --> 00:05:31.960
that could circumscribe
that triangle.

00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:34.660
You could have this
circle right over here.

00:05:34.660 --> 00:05:36.110
So you see clearly,
very clearly,

00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:38.330
that two points are not enough.

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:41.390
You need three points, three
points lead to a triangle,

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:43.150
lead to a unique circle.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:45.170
So that by itself
is kind of cool.

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:48.530
Now, another question is,
if I have just a circle,

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:55.230
and if it's circumscribed
about an arbitrary triangle,

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:59.345
is the center of that circle
necessarily the circumcenter?

00:05:59.345 --> 00:06:00.970
So let's think about
that a little bit,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:08.280
because there are some
non-intuitive cases here.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:13.100
So if I draw a circle
right over here,

00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.370
its center is right over there.

00:06:15.370 --> 00:06:17.840
And if I draw an
arbitrary triangle where

00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:21.760
all of the vertices of that
triangle are on this circle,

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:26.070
is this center necessarily the
circumcenter of that triangle?

00:06:26.070 --> 00:06:28.480
So let me draw a
crazy situation.

00:06:28.480 --> 00:06:30.800
So let me draw one where
this thing is clearly

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:33.130
outside of the
triangle, so that we

00:06:33.130 --> 00:06:35.370
could have a triangle
that looks like this.

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:38.264
And it's clearly all three
vertices sit on the circle.

00:06:38.264 --> 00:06:39.930
So you might at first
say, wait, there's

00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:41.530
no way this could
be the circumcenter,

00:06:41.530 --> 00:06:43.170
it's not even
inside the triangle.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:46.170
But remember, this
point right here

00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:48.704
is equidistant to every
point on the circle.

00:06:48.704 --> 00:06:50.370
I should say, every
point on this circle

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:53.950
is equidistant from this point,
they're all the radius away.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:58.050
And all three points of this
triangle are on the circle,

00:06:58.050 --> 00:07:00.750
so they are all exactly a radius
away from this point right

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:01.320
over here.

00:07:01.320 --> 00:07:04.040
So this distance right over
here is going to be a radius,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:06.900
this distance right over
here is going to be a radius,

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:10.690
and this distance right over
here is going to be a radius.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:14.170
Now, this point is clearly
equidistant from that point

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:15.620
and that point.

00:07:15.620 --> 00:07:17.330
We know that, it's
exactly R away

00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.527
from both of those
vertices of the triangle.

00:07:20.527 --> 00:07:22.110
So if it's equidistant--
and we proved

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.526
this in a previous
video-- if it's

00:07:23.526 --> 00:07:25.420
equidistant from
both of those points,

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.840
it must be on the
perpendicular bisector

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.620
of the segment that
joins those two points.

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:35.400
So this must be on the
perpendicular bisector--

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:38.630
so that's perpendicular
and it bisects

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:40.047
that segment right over there.

00:07:40.047 --> 00:07:42.380
But we can make the same
argument for this segment right

00:07:42.380 --> 00:07:46.560
over here, because this point
is R from the center-- we'll

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.670
call it O, I am tired of
just saying this point.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:52.890
Point O is equidistant
from-- let me label these,

00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:55.880
so let's call this A, B, C.

00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:59.310
So we already said point O
is equidistant from C and B,

00:07:59.310 --> 00:08:02.680
so it must be on the
perpendicular bisector of BC.

00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:05.340
And it's also
equidistant from A and B.

00:08:05.340 --> 00:08:08.390
It's R away from both, because
A and B both sit on the circle,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:10.750
they're both a radius
away from the center.

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.440
So it also must sit on the
perpendicular bisector of AB.

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:22.160
Let me draw it a little
bit neater, there you go.

00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:25.990
So it must also be on this
perpendicular bisector.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.350
And then finally, it also
is equidistant from A.

00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.790
It's for the same distance
from A is it is from C.

00:08:32.790 --> 00:08:35.760
Because those are both R away,
they both sit on the circle,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.010
so it must be on the
perpendicular bisector of AC

00:08:39.010 --> 00:08:41.980
as well.

00:08:41.980 --> 00:08:43.704
So AC is right over here.

00:08:43.704 --> 00:08:45.120
This is what the
interesting thing

00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:50.480
is, we're seeing that the
three perpendicular bisectors

00:08:50.480 --> 00:08:52.030
of the three sides
of this triangle,

00:08:52.030 --> 00:08:53.940
they do definitely
intersect, but they

00:08:53.940 --> 00:08:57.460
are intersecting at a point
outside of that triangle.

00:08:57.460 --> 00:09:00.210
And that point is the
center of the circle.

00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:06.080
So once again, the last idea is,
O is equidistant from A and C,

00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:09.230
so it must sit on the
perpendicular bisector of AC,

00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.680
which would look
something like this, which

00:09:11.680 --> 00:09:15.830
would look something like that.

00:09:15.830 --> 00:09:18.380
So once again, we see the three
perpendicular bisectors are

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:21.090
intersecting at a unique
point, and O really

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.580
is the circumcenter.

00:09:23.580 --> 00:09:26.535
So if you take any circle,
if you take a circle,

00:09:26.535 --> 00:09:28.950
and if you put any
triangle whose vertices

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:31.630
sit on the circle, the
center of that circle

00:09:31.630 --> 00:09:33.270
is its circumcenter.

00:09:33.270 --> 00:09:35.740
So we just drew
a situation where

00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:38.940
this is the circumcenter that
sits outside of the triangle

00:09:38.940 --> 00:09:39.820
proper.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:46.010
So point O is also going
to be the circumcenter

00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:48.160
of this triangle
right over here.

00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.090
And point O is also going
to be the circumcenter

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:54.710
of this triangle
right over here.

00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:57.030
It's going to sit on
all three perpendicular

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:59.390
bisectors of this, and
we know that because it's

00:09:59.390 --> 00:10:02.840
equidistant from all
three points of any

00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:06.480
of these triangles where the
vertices sit on the circle

00:10:06.480 --> 00:10:07.536
itself.
