00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:02.569
 (upbeat music)

00:00:03.936 --> 00:00:06.572 size:88% position:44%
  - Try to get it off of me.

00:00:06.605 --> 00:00:08.274
Get it off of me, what is this?

00:00:08.307 --> 00:00:10.243 size:84% position:42%
  This is not even
  my shampoo again.

 Hi, my name is Arturo Castro,

00:00:12.044 --> 00:00:14.347 line:0%
 I play Jamie, hello everybody.

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:15.848
 This is the bedbugs episode.

00:00:15.881 --> 00:00:17.583 align:start position:0%
  I've just been in a shower
  with all my clothes on.

00:00:17.616 --> 00:00:19.118
 - [Director] Alright,
 let's start the water,

00:00:19.151 --> 00:00:20.153 size:84% position:42%
  let's roll sound.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.087
- [Arturo] Whoo!

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.388
 Bring it baby!

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:26.159
 We have bedbugs! (screaming)

00:00:27.326 --> 00:00:29.896
- Directing Hannibal,
Arturo and Abby, to me,

00:00:29.929 --> 00:00:31.564 align:start size:88% position:13%
if I'm not in the
scene, it's so much fun,

00:00:31.597 --> 00:00:35.668 align:start size:88% position:13%
and it's just play, it's
just so fun and play.

00:00:35.701 --> 00:00:38.538 size:84% position:42%
  But being in the scene, I
  felt very self-conscious

00:00:38.571 --> 00:00:41.040
 because you can't even
 filter your thoughts.

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.910 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
 I felt like I was
 like "Totally dude.",

00:00:43.943 --> 00:00:45.478 line:0%
Okay, let me just do that again,

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:46.979 size:88% position:44% line:0%
  "Totally, dude.", Okay now
  have him like, turn to me.

00:00:47.012 --> 00:00:49.382 line:0%
 It's like you seem
 like a crazy person.

00:00:49.415 --> 00:00:50.650
Great.
- Cool.

00:00:50.683 --> 00:00:52.285
- Well, I wanted to do
one more, like smaller.

00:00:52.318 --> 00:00:53.953
 - Maybe we got them from Abby.

00:00:53.986 --> 00:00:55.655 align:start size:88% position:13%
- (gasps) Don't you dare
bring her into this!

00:00:55.688 --> 00:00:58.291 align:start position:0%
  - This is the first season
  I think you see them

00:00:58.324 --> 00:00:59.692 align:start position:0%
 actually get into an
 argument over the bed bugs.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:01.527 align:start position:0%
 - That was like an
 overnight, just him and me,

00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:02.895
 scene after scene after scene.

00:01:02.928 --> 00:01:06.099 align:start size:88% position:13%
I went nuts, I was like
a maniacal monster.

00:01:06.132 --> 00:01:08.234 align:start position:0%
 - But it was like the right,
 - The vibe.

00:01:08.267 --> 00:01:10.636 align:start position:0%
 - What are you a fucking dog?
 - Are you? I dunno.

00:01:10.669 --> 00:01:11.871
- A fucking rat?

00:01:11.904 --> 00:01:13.306
 - It's really exciting because

00:01:13.339 --> 00:01:14.907 size:88% position:44%
 even when they're fighting,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:17.009
 they're still fighting
 as really like family,

00:01:17.042 --> 00:01:18.478
 you know what I mean? (laughs)

00:01:18.511 --> 00:01:20.346 align:start position:0%
Until you mention Abby, and
then you get a slap in the face.

00:01:20.379 --> 00:01:22.415 size:88% position:44%
  I might have gone too far.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.951 align:start size:88% position:13%
Broad City was my first
big gig, you know.

00:01:24.984 --> 00:01:26.919
 And after that other
 stuff has come but,

00:01:26.952 --> 00:01:28.721 align:start size:88% position:13%
 I haven't found
 the sense of family

00:01:28.754 --> 00:01:31.023
 or sense of belonging like I
 do here, you know what I mean?

00:01:31.056 --> 00:01:33.993
 I don't know man, I feel like
 the luckiest man in the world.

00:01:34.026 --> 00:01:35.561 size:88% position:44%
 Just kill me now,
 just fucking do it.

00:01:35.594 --> 00:01:38.498
Just kill me, just kill me now.

00:01:38.531 --> 00:01:41.134
 (upbeat music)
