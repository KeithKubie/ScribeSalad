00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:03.010
Now that have a basic
understanding of what a ratio

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:06.130
is, let's see if we can tackle
some more advanced problems.

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:07.250
So, I have a classroom.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.960
It's got 55 students in it.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.580
55 students.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:18.970
And I also know that the ratio
of boys to girls, the ratio of

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:25.395
I'll write it this way,
boys to girls is 4:7.

00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.510
What I want to know is, how
many girls do I need to add.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:44.510
So, how many girls need to add,
or do I need to add, do I need

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:57.360
to add, for the ratio, for
the ratio to become 1:2.

00:00:57.360 --> 00:00:59.180
1:2.

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.210
And this is the ratio
of boys to girls.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:02.805
I'm not switching
the ratio on you.

00:01:02.805 --> 00:01:07.120
So, right now for every
4 boys, I have 7 girls.

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:09.480
I want to add some girls so
that the ratio becomes for

00:01:09.480 --> 00:01:11.540
every boy, I have 2 girls.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:12.880
So how can you do this?

00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:15.620
Well, just going back to the
basic ratio video, the first

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:18.140
thing we can do we, know the
total number of students.

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:19.720
And we know the ratio.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.490
So maybe it'll help us to
figure out the number of boys

00:01:22.490 --> 00:01:24.650
and girls we have right now.

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.200
So our current ratio is 4:7.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:33.660
So boys, boys, to girls,
right now is equal to 4:7.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:35.590
That means -- what
does that mean?

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.820
That means for every, if
you add up these two.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:52.000
For every 11 students there
are 4 boys and 7 girls.

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.945
There are 4 boys, 4
boys and 7 girls.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:03.380
That's what this
ratio tells us.

00:02:03.380 --> 00:02:08.170
You give me 11 students of
this -- you could split

00:02:08.170 --> 00:02:10.050
this classroom into
a bunch of groups.

00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:12.550
And for every group of 11,
you're going to have 4 boys

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:15.440
and 7 girls that's
all that tells me.

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.780
For every 11 students,
4 boys and 7 girls.

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.830
If you split them, every
group has the same number

00:02:20.830 --> 00:02:22.260
of boys and girls.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:25.680
Now, how many groups of
11 students there are?

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:27.510
So there are 55 students.

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:31.770
We have 55 students total.

00:02:31.770 --> 00:02:34.130
And we're breaking them
into groups of 11.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:36.120
And every group will
have the same number

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:37.660
of boys and of girls.

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:39.380
So we have 11 groups.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:46.540
Sorry, if we divide by
11 students per group.

00:02:46.540 --> 00:02:50.400
Students per group.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.780
So how many groups of 11
students do we have?

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:56.700
That means we have 5
groups of 11 students.

00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:04.250
5 groups of 11 students.

00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:06.010
And we've done this
drill before.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:08.920
Every group has 4 boys
and it has 7 girls.

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.600
So we have 5 groups.

00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:15.160
5 groups each of them has 4
boys, that means we have 5

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.460
times 4, which is
equal to 20 boys.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:24.700
And we have 5 times 7, we
have 5 groups, 5 times 7,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.390
each group has 7 girls.

00:03:26.390 --> 00:03:27.190
Of girls.

00:03:27.190 --> 00:03:30.740
So that's equal to 35 girls.

00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:31.840
And the numbers add up.

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:34.000
20 plus 35 is 55.

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:40.190
And 20 to 35, 20 to
35, is equal to 4:7.

00:03:40.190 --> 00:03:41.420
So it all works out.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:43.490
So that's what we
have right now.

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:45.710
Now, we're going to add to
girls to the classroom

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.475
to change the ratio.

00:03:47.475 --> 00:03:49.470
So let's do this.

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:53.910
So right now we have 20 boys.

00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.360
We have 20 boys.

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:56.850
And we have 35 girls.

00:03:56.850 --> 00:04:00.130
We just figure that out.

00:04:00.130 --> 00:04:02.590
And I'm going to add some
girls to the classroom.

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:05.760
So I'm going to add some girls
to the classroom And my new

00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:10.110
ratio, after I add these g
girls to the classroom, my new

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.360
ratio is going to be 1:2.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.830
1:2.

00:04:14.830 --> 00:04:17.050
So I have an equation
I have one unknown, I

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:18.150
can just solve for it.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.185
You can almost do this
one in your head.

00:04:20.185 --> 00:04:24.450
20 is to what, 1 is to
2 as 20 as to what?

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:28.240
You could say, oh, 20 is -- 1
is 1/2 of 20, 20 is 1/2 of 40.

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.740
So you could say, oh, it's 40.

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.400
So g would be equal to 5.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.620
That's how you would
solve it in your head.

00:04:32.620 --> 00:04:34.950
If you want to do it
algebraically, you

00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:36.250
could cross-multiply.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.280
So you get 35 plus g times 1.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:43.180
So you get 35 plus g is
equal to 2 times 20.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.270
Is equal to 40, which
is essentially what

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:45.950
we did in our head.

00:04:45.950 --> 00:04:48.360
We said, hey, this thing
has to be equal to forty.

00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.590
So, if you subtract 35
from both sides, you

00:04:50.590 --> 00:04:52.370
get g is equal to 5.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:55.960
So if you add 5 girls to your
classroom, you're going

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.540
to have 40 girls.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:01.100
So then you'd have 40 girls.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.110
And you have 20 boys.

00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.560
And your ratio is 20:40,
which is 2:4, which is

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.480
the same thing is 1:2.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:11.720
And we've done our problem.
