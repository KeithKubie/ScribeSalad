I love thinking about leveraging the

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:05.920
I love thinking about leveraging the
 

00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:07.730
I love thinking about leveraging the
laws of likability when giving feedback

00:00:07.730 --> 00:00:07.740
laws of likability when giving feedback
 

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.900
laws of likability when giving feedback
because feedback is only effective if

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:09.910
because feedback is only effective if
 

00:00:09.910 --> 00:00:12.930
because feedback is only effective if
somebody can receive it so you want to

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:12.940
somebody can receive it so you want to
 

00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:15.270
somebody can receive it so you want to
present feedback I say on a silver

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:15.280
present feedback I say on a silver
 

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:17.820
present feedback I say on a silver
platter and not on a garbage can lid you

00:00:17.820 --> 00:00:17.830
platter and not on a garbage can lid you
 

00:00:17.830 --> 00:00:19.050
platter and not on a garbage can lid you
have to remember it's not about your

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:19.060

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.050
communication style
 

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.710
communication style
it's about there's the best way to

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:22.720
it's about there's the best way to
 

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:24.750
it's about there's the best way to
develop your people is to flex to them

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:24.760

what they need
 

00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:31.050
what they need
that's a manager that's a leader that's

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.060
that's a manager that's a leader that's
 

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.229
that's a manager that's a leader that's
a coach so if there's somebody who

00:00:34.229 --> 00:00:34.239
a coach so if there's somebody who
 

00:00:34.239 --> 00:00:35.790
a coach so if there's somebody who
really likes direct feedback even if

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:35.800
really likes direct feedback even if
 

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:36.600
really likes direct feedback even if
it's something you're not comfortable

00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:36.610
it's something you're not comfortable
 

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:39.120
it's something you're not comfortable
with they will respect and be able to

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:39.130
with they will respect and be able to
 

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.220
with they will respect and be able to
take it in better if you can just get to

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.230
take it in better if you can just get to
 

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:43.380
take it in better if you can just get to
the point if you're somebody who's

00:00:43.380 --> 00:00:43.390
the point if you're somebody who's
 

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:45.000
the point if you're somebody who's
really direct and they need a little bit

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.010
really direct and they need a little bit
 

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:47.940
really direct and they need a little bit
more tact and diplomacy then you're not

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:47.950
more tact and diplomacy then you're not

going to need to massage your messaging

00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:50.620
going to need to massage your messaging
 

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:53.310
going to need to massage your messaging
so again it can be heard there's a

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:53.320
so again it can be heard there's a
 

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:55.650
so again it can be heard there's a
correlation between the speed at which

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:55.660
correlation between the speed at which
 

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:58.080
correlation between the speed at which
somebody receives that feedback and the

00:00:58.080 --> 00:00:58.090
somebody receives that feedback and the
 

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:00.090
somebody receives that feedback and the
importance that they place on it when

00:01:00.090 --> 00:01:00.100
importance that they place on it when
 

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:03.240
importance that they place on it when
you delay feedback you delay the value

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:03.250
you delay feedback you delay the value
 

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.269
you delay feedback you delay the value
you're placing on it so immediacy is

00:01:06.269 --> 00:01:06.279
you're placing on it so immediacy is
 

00:01:06.279 --> 00:01:09.209
you're placing on it so immediacy is
important now not in the exact moment

let them have a moment to breathe but
 

00:01:11.709 --> 00:01:13.980
let them have a moment to breathe but
don't wait more than a day if you can if

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:13.990
don't wait more than a day if you can if
 

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.109
don't wait more than a day if you can if
it's really crucial you you have that

weekly reading sometimes it will fade

00:01:18.959 --> 00:01:18.969
weekly reading sometimes it will fade
 

00:01:18.969 --> 00:01:20.399
weekly reading sometimes it will fade
from your memory by that point it

00:01:20.399 --> 00:01:20.409
from your memory by that point it
 

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:22.260
from your memory by that point it
becomes less important to you and to

00:01:22.260 --> 00:01:22.270
becomes less important to you and to

them so make sure you give that feedback
 

00:01:24.869 --> 00:01:29.219
them so make sure you give that feedback
quickly and specifically don't just say

00:01:29.219 --> 00:01:29.229
quickly and specifically don't just say
 

00:01:29.229 --> 00:01:32.519
quickly and specifically don't just say
oh I think it went well tell them why

something to keep growing from so if you

00:01:41.159 --> 00:01:41.169
something to keep growing from so if you
 

00:01:41.169 --> 00:01:42.749
something to keep growing from so if you
think about the most important law of

which is implying that you don't think
 

00:02:29.049 --> 00:02:32.520
which is implying that you don't think
that went well instead you ask how do

conversation is to get the information

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:43.480
conversation is to get the information
 

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.720
conversation is to get the information
from them it actually makes it easier on

00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:45.730
from them it actually makes it easier on
