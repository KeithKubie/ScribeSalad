00:00:00.834 --> 00:00:03.003
( intro music )

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.800
( radio signal )

00:00:35.734 --> 00:00:39.039
( ethereal music )

00:00:46.679 --> 00:00:50.183
( audience applause )

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:53.420
Linda: Ten years ago today,
the Cassini spacecraft

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.457 line:0%
flawlessly executed a
nail-biting 96 minute burn

00:00:58.457 --> 00:01:01.260 line:0%
to become the first
man-made object

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.863 line:0%
to go into orbit around Saturn.

00:01:03.863 --> 00:01:06.199
And Cassini carried with
it ESA's Huygens Probe,

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:09.669
which we later sent down
to the surface of Titan.

00:01:09.669 --> 00:01:12.304
And so we celebrate today

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.207
Cassini's ten-year anniversary,

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:16.709
and I'll share
with you just a few

00:01:16.709 --> 00:01:19.579
of the amazing findings
that we've made with Cassini.

00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:22.648
What we have here is one of my

00:01:22.648 --> 00:01:25.017
favorite pictures of
Saturn and the rings.

00:01:25.017 --> 00:01:27.686
It's a view that you
won't see from the Earth.

00:01:27.686 --> 00:01:31.124
Cassini is high above Saturn's
north pole looking down

00:01:31.124 --> 00:01:34.327
and the rings form a giant
bulls-eye around the planet.

00:01:34.327 --> 00:01:36.529
And you can actually
see Saturn's shadow

00:01:36.529 --> 00:01:38.431
going out across the rings.

00:01:38.431 --> 00:01:41.267
Up on the north pole, you see
a greenish six-sided area.

00:01:41.267 --> 00:01:43.335
We call this the hexagon.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:46.605
Very interesting and
intriguing kind of storm.

00:01:46.605 --> 00:01:48.474
Saturn is the
second-largest planet

00:01:48.474 --> 00:01:50.109
in our solar system.

00:01:50.109 --> 00:01:52.778
It only has pretty much
a hydrogen atmosphere,

00:01:52.778 --> 00:01:55.180
no solid surface underneath it.

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.482
And if you could build a bathtub

00:01:56.482 --> 00:01:58.318
big enough to hold Saturn,

00:01:58.318 --> 00:02:00.252
Saturn would float.

00:02:00.252 --> 00:02:03.289
So how big is Saturn really?

00:02:03.289 --> 00:02:06.492
Well if we put the Earth
and the moon to scale,

00:02:06.492 --> 00:02:10.329
next to Saturn, along with
the distance between them,

00:02:10.329 --> 00:02:12.532
we can see that
Saturn is indeed huge.

00:02:12.532 --> 00:02:17.403
In fact, it would take
764 Earths to fill up

00:02:17.403 --> 00:02:18.904
the volume of Saturn,

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:21.374
a giant planet, indeed.

00:02:21.374 --> 00:02:23.642
Well let's look a
little bit more closely

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.645
at that north polar hexagon.

00:02:25.645 --> 00:02:27.847
If you look at the
image on your left,

00:02:27.847 --> 00:02:30.182
you can see this greenish
area surrounded by

00:02:30.182 --> 00:02:32.718
a six-sided jet stream.

00:02:32.718 --> 00:02:35.755
Voyager, 30 years ago,
saw this jet stream

00:02:35.755 --> 00:02:39.358
with these six sides,
and it's still there today.

00:02:39.358 --> 00:02:41.227
It's a very interesting puzzle.

00:02:41.227 --> 00:02:44.063
Greenish in color,
that's its winter hemisphere.

00:02:44.063 --> 00:02:46.298
As the sun continues
to shine in the north,

00:02:46.298 --> 00:02:48.434
we'll see that greenish
color become more of

00:02:48.434 --> 00:02:51.336
the golden color we're used
to for Saturn's atmosphere.

00:02:51.336 --> 00:02:54.407
Tiny white clouds circle
inside the hexagon.

00:02:54.407 --> 00:02:57.009
And Cassini
discovered at the very

00:02:57.009 --> 00:03:00.379
center of the hexagon
a giant hurricane.

00:03:00.379 --> 00:03:02.414
That hurricane
would span half

00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:04.450
the continental United States.

00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.752
It would go from
Washington, D.C.

00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:10.757
to Tulsa, Oklahoma:
a giant storm.

00:03:10.757 --> 00:03:12.358
The sun is shining
from the right,

00:03:12.358 --> 00:03:14.627
and you can actually
see shadows from

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:17.997
the eyewall of that
giant hurricane.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:21.166
We study the hexagon and
the hurricane at Saturn

00:03:21.166 --> 00:03:23.002
to get a better understanding

00:03:23.002 --> 00:03:25.338
of the weather
here on the Earth.

00:03:26.338 --> 00:03:27.941
Let's move on to Saturn's rings.

00:03:27.941 --> 00:03:29.809
I actually started
working on rings

00:03:29.809 --> 00:03:31.410
in the Voyager days.

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:34.180
And so they hold a
special place in my heart.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:36.549
There's a lot of intricate
detailed structure

00:03:36.549 --> 00:03:38.217
inside of the rings.

00:03:38.217 --> 00:03:40.886
The rings are made up of
billions upon billions

00:03:40.886 --> 00:03:43.255
of icy particles orbiting Saturn

00:03:43.255 --> 00:03:45.257
in an intricate cosmic dance.

00:03:45.257 --> 00:03:47.025
And every once in a
while these particles

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:49.362
jostle and run into one another.

00:03:49.362 --> 00:03:51.564
The rings have
very simple names.

00:03:51.564 --> 00:03:54.434
As you go outward, you
can have, you can see

00:03:54.434 --> 00:03:57.269
you have the A ring
on your far right.

00:03:57.269 --> 00:03:59.905
Then there's a gap,
the very bright B ring,

00:03:59.905 --> 00:04:01.741
most of the particles are there.

00:04:01.741 --> 00:04:04.344
The particles range in
size from tiny marbles

00:04:04.344 --> 00:04:07.646
to giant mountain-sized
particles.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:09.849
That grayish ring is the C ring,

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:12.684
and then finally the
innermost ring, the D ring.

00:04:12.684 --> 00:04:14.120
And at the end of the mission,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.555
Cassini is gonna dive in
between Saturn's D ring

00:04:16.555 --> 00:04:18.591
and the top of the atmosphere

00:04:18.591 --> 00:04:21.294
for some remarkable
brand new science.

00:04:21.294 --> 00:04:23.128
You'll notice that
there's a black gap

00:04:23.128 --> 00:04:26.198
in between the A ring
and the B ring.

00:04:26.198 --> 00:04:28.200
That's the Cassini division,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:30.169
named after the
astronomer Cassini,

00:04:30.169 --> 00:04:32.939
who first discovered
it, and our mission

00:04:32.939 --> 00:04:35.674
is named in honor
of that astronomer.

00:04:35.674 --> 00:04:39.311
Well, Cassini had a rare
opportunity in 2009.

00:04:39.311 --> 00:04:41.380
We were actually able
to observe the rings

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:44.016
when the Sun was
edge on to them.

00:04:44.016 --> 00:04:46.452
And anything that
would cast a shadow

00:04:46.452 --> 00:04:47.953
would be visible and seen.

00:04:47.953 --> 00:04:50.990
So let's look at the
outer edge of the B ring

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:53.726
and see what
Cassini saw in 2009.

00:04:54.560 --> 00:04:56.229
Here's the outer
edge of the B ring,

00:04:56.229 --> 00:04:58.230
that bright ring with
all of those structures,

00:04:58.230 --> 00:05:00.299
the Cassini division on top.

00:05:00.299 --> 00:05:02.768
The Sun is shining
from the top down,

00:05:02.768 --> 00:05:05.805
and you can see all
sorts of shadows.

00:05:05.805 --> 00:05:09.809
Here are particles that are
one or two miles in size

00:05:09.809 --> 00:05:13.112
casting these long shadows
at the edge of the ring.

00:05:13.112 --> 00:05:16.582
And the ring itself is
only about 30 feet thick.

00:05:16.582 --> 00:05:18.951
A good analogy for how
we see these shadows.

00:05:18.951 --> 00:05:22.054
Imagine yourself riding
along on the space station.

00:05:22.054 --> 00:05:23.489
You look down on Egypt,

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.591
and you want to
find the pyramids.

00:05:25.591 --> 00:05:28.327
But if you look at noon,
you won't see any shadows,

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:30.797
and it'll be very
hard to pick them out.

00:05:30.797 --> 00:05:32.264
Now imagine that
you look for these

00:05:32.264 --> 00:05:33.599
same pyramids at sunset.

00:05:33.599 --> 00:05:36.068
And they'll be casting
these long shadows.

00:05:36.068 --> 00:05:38.137
And they'll be very easy to see

00:05:38.137 --> 00:05:39.838
on the desert in Egypt.

00:05:39.838 --> 00:05:42.641
And in the same way,
Cassini for the first time

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.010
could see that there were
big particles in the rings

00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:47.146
at the outer edge of the B ring.

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:49.115
These objects are
probably made of

00:05:49.115 --> 00:05:51.284
agglomerations
of ring particles.

00:05:51.284 --> 00:05:54.119
And the way these come
together and coalesce,

00:05:54.119 --> 00:05:55.988
give us information
about how the planets

00:05:55.988 --> 00:05:58.891
in our solar system
actually came together

00:05:58.891 --> 00:06:00.593
and formed as well.

00:06:01.627 --> 00:06:03.128
This is a view of
the largest moon

00:06:03.128 --> 00:06:04.630
in the Saturn system.

00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:06.332
This is giant Titan.

00:06:06.332 --> 00:06:08.501
It's 3,000 miles across,

00:06:08.501 --> 00:06:11.169
about the size of
the planet Mercury.

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:13.505
A Titan has a liquid water ocean

00:06:13.505 --> 00:06:16.709
underneath its icy
crust, and this is one

00:06:16.709 --> 00:06:20.613
possible place that
might harbor life.

00:06:20.613 --> 00:06:22.581
Titan has a thick
nitrogen atmosphere.

00:06:22.581 --> 00:06:23.915
It's about four times as dense

00:06:23.915 --> 00:06:25.718
as the atmosphere in this room.

00:06:25.718 --> 00:06:28.053
And the surface is a chilly

00:06:28.053 --> 00:06:31.023
minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit.

00:06:31.023 --> 00:06:32.924
There's also methane in
the atmosphere of Titan,

00:06:32.924 --> 00:06:35.061
and that methane at
the top is broken apart

00:06:35.061 --> 00:06:39.232
by sunlight, forms these
long smoggy hydrocarbons

00:06:39.232 --> 00:06:42.734
and gives Titan that sort
of golden-colored haze.

00:06:42.734 --> 00:06:45.004
And we can't really
see through the haze.

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:47.473
And it took ESA's
Huygens Probe

00:06:47.473 --> 00:06:49.908
to parachute down through
to the surface of Titan

00:06:49.908 --> 00:06:54.279
to give us our first
view of an amazing world.

00:06:54.279 --> 00:06:56.648
It turns out that methane
plays the same role

00:06:56.648 --> 00:06:59.317
on Titan that water
plays here on the Earth,

00:06:59.317 --> 00:07:00.987
with the same kind of weather.

00:07:00.987 --> 00:07:04.056
Only now you have
methane clouds.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:05.357
Methane rain.

00:07:05.357 --> 00:07:08.227
Methane flowing through
the river channels,

00:07:08.227 --> 00:07:10.963
and methane filling
the lakes and seas.

00:07:10.963 --> 00:07:13.432
In fact, if you look at
this image behind me,

00:07:13.432 --> 00:07:17.536
that topmost black smudge,
that's Ligeia Mare,

00:07:17.536 --> 00:07:19.739
the second-largest sea on Titan.

00:07:19.739 --> 00:07:23.242
And if we look up close
at that particular sea,

00:07:23.242 --> 00:07:26.178
here's the radar view
with the long wavelengths.

00:07:26.178 --> 00:07:28.747
You can penetrate
down through the haze.

00:07:28.747 --> 00:07:31.050
You can see the river
channels of methane

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.619
flowing into this
particular lake,

00:07:33.619 --> 00:07:37.656
and even tiny islands
in this particular sea.

00:07:37.656 --> 00:07:40.259
This, this sea Ligeia
Mare is about 50 percent

00:07:40.259 --> 00:07:42.828
bigger than Lake Superior
here on the Earth.

00:07:42.828 --> 00:07:45.397
And it's about 500 feet deep.

00:07:45.397 --> 00:07:47.766
That's something we
found out with Cassini.

00:07:47.766 --> 00:07:49.602
And if you take the
seas and you add up

00:07:49.602 --> 00:07:52.704
all the hydrocarbons that
are present in the seas,

00:07:52.704 --> 00:07:54.673
it turns out there's
about a hundred times

00:07:54.673 --> 00:07:56.876
more hydrocarbons
on Titan

00:07:56.876 --> 00:08:00.479
than all of the reservoirs
here on the Earth.

00:08:00.479 --> 00:08:03.182
It's just too bad
Titan's so far away,

00:08:03.182 --> 00:08:05.517
or our hydrocarbon
problems would be solved.

00:08:05.517 --> 00:08:07.286
( laughter )

00:08:07.286 --> 00:08:09.922
And the seas themselves
are very interesting,

00:08:09.922 --> 00:08:12.658
because you wonder,
with liquid methane,

00:08:12.658 --> 00:08:14.827
could a form of life
exist that would use

00:08:14.827 --> 00:08:18.097
liquid methane,
rather than water,

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:20.099
to form and move about.

00:08:20.099 --> 00:08:23.902
So very intriguing to
think about that for Titan.

00:08:23.902 --> 00:08:25.404
Now we move on to another world,

00:08:25.404 --> 00:08:27.406
another moon around Saturn.

00:08:27.406 --> 00:08:29.241
This is Enceladus.

00:08:29.241 --> 00:08:32.077
Enceladus is only
about 300 miles across.

00:08:32.077 --> 00:08:34.980
So 1/10th the size of Titan.

00:08:34.980 --> 00:08:37.983
And what you see here
is an icy white surface

00:08:37.983 --> 00:08:39.718
with very few craters.

00:08:39.718 --> 00:08:42.221
And the brightness and
the absence of craters

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:45.191
tell us that this is a
very, very young surface.

00:08:45.191 --> 00:08:47.059
And Cassini was
the first to see,

00:08:47.059 --> 00:08:48.527
at the south pole
you can see these

00:08:48.527 --> 00:08:51.129
bluish fractures down
here at the bottom.

00:08:51.129 --> 00:08:52.998
We nicknamed them tiger stripes.

00:08:52.998 --> 00:08:55.734
They kind of reminded
us of tiger stripes,

00:08:55.734 --> 00:08:58.203
and we were really
amazed to see what was

00:08:58.203 --> 00:09:02.241
coming out of these tiger
stripes on this tiny moon.

00:09:02.241 --> 00:09:04.343
I was amazed as everyone
else when we first

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:07.979
took a look and saw, and
this is in a backlit view,

00:09:07.979 --> 00:09:11.550
coming out of those
tiger stripes were jets.

00:09:11.550 --> 00:09:13.886
Jets of water
vapor and water ice

00:09:13.886 --> 00:09:16.222
with some other
compounds mixed in.

00:09:16.222 --> 00:09:18.758
We saw dozens and
dozens of these jets

00:09:18.758 --> 00:09:20.793
actively going off.

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:22.628
Some of the tiniest
particles escape

00:09:22.628 --> 00:09:24.629
and actually go
on to form a ring

00:09:24.629 --> 00:09:27.265
within Enceladus'
orbit, the E ring.

00:09:27.265 --> 00:09:28.800
So just so intriguing to see.

00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:31.503
In fact, Cassini
actually flew through

00:09:31.503 --> 00:09:34.773
those jets and sampled
their composition.

00:09:34.773 --> 00:09:37.777
And we found carbon
dioxide, we found ammonia,

00:09:37.777 --> 00:09:39.445
we found salts.

00:09:39.445 --> 00:09:41.213
We found the kinds
of ingredients

00:09:41.213 --> 00:09:43.582
that you'd need to
find to have life.

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:45.817
And it turns out there's
a liquid water ocean

00:09:45.817 --> 00:09:47.819
underneath Enceladus' south pole

00:09:47.819 --> 00:09:50.389
supplying these jets and vents.

00:09:50.389 --> 00:09:52.657
And in a sense we
have free samples.

00:09:52.657 --> 00:09:54.926
We just don't know if
there might be life

00:09:54.926 --> 00:09:57.195
inside of these free samples.

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:59.698
So we have two worlds:
Titan and Enceladus,

00:09:59.698 --> 00:10:03.101
that might possibly have life.

00:10:03.101 --> 00:10:05.971
And finally, another
iconic backlit image.

00:10:05.971 --> 00:10:07.940
This image was
taken when Cassini

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.341
was in Saturn's shadow.

00:10:09.341 --> 00:10:11.677
This doesn't happen very
often in the mission.

00:10:11.677 --> 00:10:14.113
When we took this
mosaic, that bluish ring

00:10:14.113 --> 00:10:16.449
around the outside,
that's the E ring

00:10:16.449 --> 00:10:19.618
created by tiny particles
coming from Enceladus.

00:10:19.618 --> 00:10:21.520
And if you look
at that white ring

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.188
completely around Saturn,

00:10:23.188 --> 00:10:25.824
sunlight is refracted
through the atmosphere.

00:10:25.824 --> 00:10:29.195
And that's every sunrise
and sunset on Saturn

00:10:29.195 --> 00:10:31.296
seen all at the same time.

00:10:31.296 --> 00:10:33.265
And there's actually
three other planets

00:10:33.265 --> 00:10:34.633
in this image.

00:10:34.633 --> 00:10:36.702
If you look at the
upper left there,

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:39.738
Mars and Venus, a little
bit difficult to see.

00:10:39.738 --> 00:10:42.975
And if you just look
here, right here,

00:10:42.975 --> 00:10:46.845
that tiny pale blue dot
is actually the Earth,

00:10:46.845 --> 00:10:48.747
actually the Earth and the moon.

00:10:48.747 --> 00:10:50.582
And when, in the 20
minutes we were taking

00:10:50.582 --> 00:10:52.985
those pictures of the
Earth and the moon,

00:10:52.985 --> 00:10:55.488
we actually asked
people, "Go outside.

00:10:55.488 --> 00:10:57.122
Wave at Saturn."

00:10:57.122 --> 00:10:59.257
( laughter )

00:10:59.257 --> 00:11:03.295
So your photons can
be captured by Cassini

00:11:03.295 --> 00:11:05.330
in these pictures of
the Earth and the moon.

00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.265
And while you're at
it, out there waving,

00:11:07.265 --> 00:11:09.835
in fact, how many people
here waved at Saturn

00:11:09.835 --> 00:11:11.703
on that particular day?

00:11:11.703 --> 00:11:12.905
Well that's great.

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:14.340
Yeah, my husband Tom
and I were out there

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:15.808
waving as well.

00:11:15.808 --> 00:11:17.876
And we asked people to take
pictures of themselves,

00:11:17.876 --> 00:11:20.546
selfies, and send
us those selfies.

00:11:20.546 --> 00:11:23.849
And we took all of those
selfies and we recreated

00:11:23.849 --> 00:11:26.251
this Saturn backlit mosaic.

00:11:26.251 --> 00:11:27.319
Here it is.

00:11:27.319 --> 00:11:28.586
( laughter )

00:11:28.586 --> 00:11:31.157
Made up of thousands of selfies.

00:11:31.157 --> 00:11:33.925
So we were really happy
to see all of the interest

00:11:33.925 --> 00:11:36.062
that the public had,
and we're very grateful

00:11:36.062 --> 00:11:38.664
to NASA for continuing to
fund extended missions.

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.098
It's been 10 years.

00:11:40.098 --> 00:11:41.533
We hope to have
another three years

00:11:41.533 --> 00:11:43.234
to our mission as well.

00:11:43.234 --> 00:11:45.537
And very recently we
had a naming contest.

00:11:45.537 --> 00:11:47.139
We asked people, you
know, we've got this

00:11:47.139 --> 00:11:50.175
exciting 22 orbits at
the end of our mission,

00:11:50.175 --> 00:11:53.111
help us name those orbits.

00:11:53.111 --> 00:11:55.280
And then we got 2,000
different entries,

00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:57.916
sorted through those,
and we came up with

00:11:57.916 --> 00:11:59.118
the winning entry.

00:11:59.118 --> 00:12:00.652
And I'm pleased to present

00:12:00.652 --> 00:12:02.755
for the very first time tonight,

00:12:02.755 --> 00:12:04.523
the winner of that
naming contest.

00:12:04.523 --> 00:12:07.659
Cassini Grand Finale.

00:12:07.659 --> 00:12:09.461
( laughter )

00:12:09.461 --> 00:12:11.664
So thank you so much
for your contributions.

00:12:11.664 --> 00:12:14.399
And that's the name of
the end of our mission.

00:12:14.399 --> 00:12:15.968
And I'm gonna be showing
you a short movie

00:12:15.968 --> 00:12:17.769
that'll show you
something about

00:12:17.769 --> 00:12:19.972
the science we'll be collecting
in the last three years,

00:12:19.972 --> 00:12:22.441
including a chance to
see what one of those

00:12:22.441 --> 00:12:25.744
orbits look like in
the Grand Finale.

00:12:25.744 --> 00:12:29.314
And with Cassini, we
had a rare opportunity

00:12:29.314 --> 00:12:30.883
and we seized it.

00:12:30.883 --> 00:12:33.519
Now sit back and
enjoy the movie.

00:12:36.755 --> 00:12:38.557
