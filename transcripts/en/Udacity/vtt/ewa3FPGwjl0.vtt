00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.480
Let's suppose that in a network we have three

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:06.820
hosts shown as squares at the edge of the

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:10.840
network that are connected by links with capacities as

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.170
shown. The two senders on the left can send

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.600
at rates of 10 megabits per second and 100

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:18.580
megabits per second, respectively. But the link to the

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:21.140
host on the right is only 1.5 megabits per

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:25.380
second. So these different hosts on the left are actually

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:29.620
competing for the same resources inside the network.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:32.100
So the sources are unaware of each other and

00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:35.110
also of the current state of whatever resource

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:37.380
they are trying to share. In this case How

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:40.310
much other traffic is on the network. This

00:00:40.310 --> 00:00:44.280
shows up as lost packets or long delays and

00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.240
can result in throughput that's less than the

00:00:46.240 --> 00:00:49.620
bottleneck link, something that's also known as congestion collapse.
