00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:04.230
Simplify n squared r
to the fifth n to

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:05.680
the negative seventh.

00:00:05.680 --> 00:00:09.040
Express your answer in
exponential form

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.260
with positive exponents.

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:13.120
Let me just rewrite what
they have up there.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:18.290
So we have n squared
r to the fifth n to

00:00:18.290 --> 00:00:19.540
the negative seventh.

00:00:19.540 --> 00:00:22.620
So the easiest way to simplify
this, I would say kind of just

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.330
while we were multiplying them,
group the common bases.

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:30.240
So we have two exponent
expressions with n as a base.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:33.360
We have n squared and we have
n to the negative seventh.

00:00:33.360 --> 00:00:36.230
So let me just rearrange this
multiplication right here.

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:40.500
I can rewrite this as n squared
n to the negative

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.940
seven and then we have
our r to the fifth.

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:46.930
And what's this going
to be equal to?

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.200
Well we have n squared times
n to the negative seven.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:52.650
We can add those
two exponents.

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.840
So this right here would
simplify to n

00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.300
to the 2 minus 7.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:01.600
2 minus 7 is negative 5.

00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:05.850
N to the negative 5,
r to the fifth.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:09.660
Now we've simplified this
about as much as we can.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:11.240
But, we're not done yet.

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.470
Because they said express your
answer in exponential form

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:16.240
with positive exponents.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.350
This is a negative
exponent here.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:20.610
This is not acceptable,
at least based on what

00:01:20.610 --> 00:01:22.680
they asked us to do.

00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.760
So we know that n to the
negative fifth is the same

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:29.510
thing as 1 over n
to the fifth.

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:31.720
So we can just rewrite
it the that way.

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:37.100
So this is the same thing
as 1 over n to the fifth

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:39.670
times r to the fifth.

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.210
Or we could say this is equal
to r to the fifth

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:47.600
over n to the fifth.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.200
And this is about as simple
as you can you can get.

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:52.100
If you wanted to do other things
here you could say that

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:57.110
this is equal to r over
n to the fifth.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:59.710
Since both of these are being
raised to the fifth power.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.130
But this is probably what
they want here.

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.120
We've simplified it and all of
the exponents are now positive

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.330
because we put the n
in the denominator.
