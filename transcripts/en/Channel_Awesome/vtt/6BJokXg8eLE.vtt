00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
This episode brought to you by Stardust:

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.500
Fans sharing video reactions to movies, TV, and trailers.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:46.540
Hello, I'm the Nostalgia Critic. I remember it so you don't have to.

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.980
Well, it's Christmas Eve, and that means meeting up with your friends and loved ones.

00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:53.720
And trying to stop them from killing each other.

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:57.220
Especially when your friends and loved ones are as polar opposite as they can get.

00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:00.440
Malcolm: Uncle Lies, Aunt Despair, can I have some water tonight?

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:02.580
Uncle Lies: Well, I suppose you've been good enough this year.

00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.160
Honey, why don't you share some of yours?

00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:05.960
Aunt Despair: Here you go.

00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.480
Chester A. Bum: Oh, now that's no way to treat a child!

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.660
Doe: Yeah, why don't you raise yours like we raised ours?

00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.700
Tamara: I'm pretty sure they did raise me before I got abandoned in the Balto review.

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:17.360
Aunt Despair: Mmm, no, that wasn't you.

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:18.220
Tamara: Pretty sure it was.

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.980
Uncle Lies: No, we remember the children we abandon.

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.720
Chester: Do you?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.720
Critic: Well, I don't know about you, but I sure am excited for our Christmas meal!

00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.080
Malcolm: Yeah, where is it? We've been waiting forever.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:29.700
Uncle Lies: Now, son, don't make us abandon you like we did her.

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.000
Doe: But you just said-

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.880
NC: The meal's taking a while because it's being specially delivered.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:38.500
Trust me, you'll only want an expert to deal with something so perfectly Christmasy.

00:01:38.500 --> 00:01:40.900
Chester: Well, as long as it's edible, I'm good.

00:01:41.380 --> 00:01:42.180
Doe: Honey!

00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:44.160
Chester: OK, it doesn't have to be edible.

00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:47.760
Aunt Despair: That explains why your kid looks like she ate chimney.

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.440
Tamara: It tasted like dying!

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:51.720
Doe: Well, at least we know where our kid is!

00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:53.100
Aunt Despair: What are you even talking a-

00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:53.940
Oh, now I get it.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.320
Uncle Lies: Hey, boy, stop eating that glue and save some for me!

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:58.080
Malcolm: I feel colors!

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.280
Chester: Parents of the year.

00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:00.880
Doe: He won't even share!

00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:02.440
Aunt Despair: You say something over there, Pubic Wig?

00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.660
NC: Hey, why don't we watch a movie?!

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:06.900
The perfect Christmas interaction where we don't have to have any interaction.

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.460
Aunt Despair: Home Alone 2? You couldn't even put on Home Alone 1?

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.700
Malcolm: Ooh, I love this movie.

00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.460
Uncle Lies: You do?

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:15.540
Tamara: Me, too!

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.700
Doe: I thought most people only like the first one.

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.760
NC: Exactly, they've seen it so many times, it's practically background noise.

00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:23.860
But everyone has interesting thoughts about Home Alone 2.

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.260
You see, when the original came out in 1990, it was huge.

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:35.260
It played at #1 for 12 weeks and turned a relatively unknown child actor, Macaulay Culkin, into a mega star.

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:38.380
So not surprisingly, 2 years later, a sequel came about,

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.040
giving everybody the same comedy they grew to love.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.240
And I do mean THE SAME COMEDY.

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:47.680
Many people were angered at how much repeating there was,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:52.180
reusing the same jokes, scenarios, even teaching the same lessons that was learned in the original!

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:56.720
Macaulay Culkin and director Chris Columbus even mock it in the first film's commentary.

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:00.240
Chris Coloumbus' Commentary: John, you said you could write this on the weekend. I wonder how long it took you to write the second one.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.080
It's like a little bit of cut-and-paste, and boom, you're done! Sequel! Bam!

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:10.120
NC: But much like Ghostbusters 2, people totally forgot they hated it because...

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:12.840
C'MON!

00:03:13.540 --> 00:03:18.340
Well, I'm here to see if there's any validity to that "C'MON!" and look at a movie that seems to divide many,

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.300
but at least can serve as a harmless distraction.

00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:24.240
Aunt Despair: I'm only watching this for Sharknado star John Heard.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:28.100
Chester: Give it a chance. This is the greatest movie I've ever seen in my life, and I don't say that often.

00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:29.180
Doe: It's true.

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:31.440
NC: Let's take a gander at Home Alone 2.

00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:40.360
We start off this roller coaster of variety with practically the same music against the same credits with the same exterior shot followed by the same interior shot.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:46.720
OK, I know you're trying to establish a style, but when you don't even need to move the tripods from your last shoot, you might wanna mix it up a bit.

00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:50.140
Hopefully, everyone's character traits are repeated, too.

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.940
Uncle Frank: Hey, easy on the fluids, pal.

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:54.900
Buzz: Now you can be a scag of a slightly darker shade of skin.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:58.860
Uncle Frank: You better not wreck my trip, you little sourpuss. Your dad's paying good money for it.

00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:03.340
Kevin: And you know what? If I had my own money, I'd go on my own vacation alone.

00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:08.060
NC: Yeah, OK, let's address what's arguably one of the biggest problems with the film:

00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.900
Macaulay Culkin's performance sucks.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:14.100
But it's not really his fault.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:19.980
He already played up the kid who has to act like an adult in the first film and he immediately became the biggest star in the world.

00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:23.800
And that's not exaggerating, he was everywhere for a while.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.760
That kind of attention, so quickly, so young, is gonna result in this kind of performance.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:31.480
The "I don't care I'm cool as shit now" performance.

00:04:31.580 --> 00:04:34.140
Kevin: He didn't mean what he said, he was just sucking up to you.

00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:38.360
At first, you look kinda scary, but when I think about it, it's not so bad.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:41.880
Without any of you guys, and I'd have the most fun in my whole life.

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.480
NC: It would happen to you, it would happen to me, it would happen to anyone.

00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.160
There's really no blame. It's just the situation.

00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:51.780
With that said, let's make fun of this like hell!

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000
Kate: Honey, are you packed yet?

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:53.800
Kevin: Yes.

00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:55.380
Talkboy: Yes.

00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:58.280
NC: I'm trying to see if I can literally phone in my performance.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.360
Kate: Did you see what Grandma Penelope sent you for the trip?

00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:00.340
Kate: Did you see what Grandma Penelope sent you for the trip?

00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.180
An inflatable clown to play with in the pool.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:03.620
Kevin: How exciting.

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:03.240
Kevin: How exciting.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.460
NC: I can't tell. Are you excited? It's eerily similar to all the times you "actually" are excited!
NC: I can't tell. Are you excited? It's eerily similar to all the times you "actually" are excited!

00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:08.160
NC: I can't tell. Are you excited? It's eerily similar to all the times you "actually" are excited!

00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:08.180
It's eerily similar to all the times you actually are excited!

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.660
Kevin: Merry Christmas, Kevin.

00:05:09.660 --> 00:05:12.140
This is the greatest accident of my life.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.060
How exciting.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.240
Why do we have to go to Florida? There's no Christmas trees in Florida.

00:05:16.240 --> 00:05:18.180
Kate: Kevin, what is it with you and Christmas trees?

00:05:18.180 --> 00:05:20.220
TV: Stay at the world renowned Plaza Hotel.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:23.340
NC: Yeah, most of this opening dialogue you can just replace with...

00:05:23.340 --> 00:05:25.600
"Why can't setup for second or third act payoff?"

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.740
"Bad joke to make it look like we're not setting up for the second or third act payoff."

00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.340
"Honey, did you setup for second or third act payoff?"

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:36.260
"Segue to other setup for second or third act payoff to make you forget about this setup for second or third payoff."

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.960
Speaking of which...

00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:41.960
Kevin has to grab his tie while his uncle sings in the shower and decides to record it.

00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:47.400
I do hope the dollar store microphone on that thing picks up the clearest audio both inside and outside the room.

00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:50.940
Frank: Get out of here, you nosy little pervert, or I'm going to slap you silly!

00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:54.800
NC: Ironically, Macaulay Culkin might be the only person from Hollywood not told that yet.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:59.260
He performs at a Christmas pageant with his brother Buzz, who proceeds to make fun of him.

00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:09.080
Oh, those easily amused pageant-goers.

00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.400
Look, the letter B!

00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:16.040
You're so ready to watch Home Alone 3!

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.860
Kevin finds out what Buzz is doing and punches him.

00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:22.540
But, because this is a Family Matters episode now it has to go more over the top.

00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:31.880
Urkel: Did I do that?

00:06:31.880 --> 00:06:37.560
NC: Funny enough,  this reveals that the only character in this sequel that strangely evolved is Buzz.

00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:43.760
I know that sounds strange, seeing how bullies are always the most underdeveloped characters, but he legitimately grows as a character.

00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:49.880
He's still a bully, but now he knows how to manipulate, his vocabulary shot up, and he seems wittier and funnier.

00:06:49.880 --> 00:06:52.520
Buzz: My prank was immature and ill timed.

00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:54.260
Merry Christmas, indeed.

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.260
What a troubled young man.

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.720
NC: The only downgrade is when he is mean, his wordage is a lot more...

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:00.640
um...

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:01.760
Disney Channel.

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:03.920
Buzz: Beat that, you little trout sniffer.

00:07:03.920 --> 00:07:06.920
NC: Ooh, trout sniffer, that's much more intimidating than...

00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.160
Buzz: [...] If you were growing on my ass!

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:16.380
NC: But hey, if you're not a fan of how the language in this one is more cleaned up than the last one, don't worry, there's plenty of more shit repeated from the first film.

00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:20.420
Kevin: If I had my own money I'd go on my own vacation, alone.

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:22.820
Kate: Well, you got your wish last year, maybe you'll get it again this year.

00:07:22.820 --> 00:07:26.300
NC (as Kate): It all depends on how lazy and rushed the writer is to get his paycheck.

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.760
Oh, you're in luck.

00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:30.060
Kate and Peter: WE DID IT AGAIN!

00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:31.080
AAAAH!

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:34.540
NC: You hear that, wall we're randomly screaming at? AAAUGH!

00:07:35.040 --> 00:07:40.000
Speed up the film, play William's Not-Cracker music again, rinse, repeat, water down.

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.400
This time, Kevin makes it,at least,as far as the airport with his family,

00:07:43.580 --> 00:07:46.240
but they get separated and Kevin gets on the wrong plane.

00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:48.000
Man: We have to close up here, they're ready to go.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.140
Woman: He dropped his boarding pass.

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.140
Kevin: This plane can't leave!

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.780
Man: Board him, but make sure he locates his family before you leave him.

00:07:53.780 --> 00:07:56.440
NC: Well, 9/11 hasn't happened yet, so go ahead!

00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:59.520
Aunt Calamity: I have some theories on why 9/11 really happened.

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.280
Doe: Really?

00:08:00.340 --> 00:08:00.840
Chester: Do tell.

00:08:00.843 --> 00:08:03.360
NC: Oh look, another possibly debatable funny scene!

00:08:03.540 --> 00:08:06.980
Yeah, watch this over and see if you snicker at something a little odd.

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.500
Kevin: Have you ever been to Florida?

00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:16.880
Man: [Speaking French]

00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:19.940
NC: Now don't get me wrong, this doesn't seem that funny.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:23.640
Whatever, he looks at the camera because a guy in a different language won't shut up.

00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:28.060
But realistically, it's the most nonsensical awkward moment.

00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:32.800
We know he's supposed to be looking at the audience, but in this situation, there is no audience.

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:35.900
So imagine you're talking to me and I suddenly just went...

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:43.880
That'd be super weird!

00:08:44.420 --> 00:08:47.700
And why is this guy still talking?  He knows Kevin doesn't speak French.

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:49.460
Does he think he made a friend?

00:08:49.460 --> 00:08:54.240
A friend who slowly shades you by looking at the airplane set with more space than any plane ever built?

00:08:54.560 --> 00:08:58.260
It's actually kind of hilarious, just not at all for the intended reasons.

00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:00.680
Kate: Aah, I just have that feeling.

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:03.940
Peter: We have everybody. There's nothing to worry about.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.840
Kate: Yeah, you're right. You're right. We're fine.

00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:12.460
(V/O): American Airlines: Losing Your Luggage AND Your Kids

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.900
NC: So Kevin, of course, ends up in New York and checks to see where he is.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:17.760
Kevin: What city is that over there?

00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:19.180
Woman: That city is New York, sir.

00:09:19.180 --> 00:09:21.600
Kevin: Yikes, I did it again.

00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.440
NC: Anyone else feel like Culkin's blank stare is trying to eat your soul?

00:09:31.700 --> 00:09:34.160
Macaulay Culkin: YOU TASTE LIKE INNOCENCE!

00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:37.900
NC: Let's do this shtick again.

00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.680
Kevin ("bummed"): My family's in Florida and I'm in New York.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:44.740
(...but not really) My family's in Florida-

00:09:44.740 --> 00:09:52.160
NC: Oh, c'mon, in the original he had to really think about it, dealing with the fact that his family was gone but then thinking about all the mean things they said to him!

00:09:52.260 --> 00:09:55.080
Here, it just looks like he suddenly thought of his residual check!

00:09:55.080 --> 00:09:57.720
Kevin: My family's in Florida and I'm in New York.

00:09:58.320 --> 00:09:59.100
[$Cha-ching$]

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:02.500
My family's in Florida-

00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:07.520
NC: Speaking of money, he uses all the cash in his dad's bag he accidentally took to see New York.

00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:09.500
He even checks out sites that are...

00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:10.400
um...

00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.160
uncomfortable to say the least.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:18.460
Aunt Despair: You see, it was all a conspiracy by the Satanists, which is why you can see the face in the smoke.

00:10:18.700 --> 00:10:20.460
NC: Hey, look, the Goodfeathers!

00:10:20.460 --> 00:10:25.960
Yup, Kevin passes by a truck the escaped convicts snuck into and their sequel material is much to be a-scared of.

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:27.980
Harry: Smell that?

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:29.540
Marv: Yeah

00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.080
Harry: You know what that is?

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.300
Marv: Fish.

00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.080
Harry: It's freedom.

00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:35.560
Marv: No, it's fish.

00:10:35.560 --> 00:10:40.600
NC: Sorry, Matthew Brodrick will master this routine six years later. There is no need in trying to top him.

00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:47.340
Harry: We get ourselves a couple of phony passports. And we hightail it to some foreign country

00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.120
Marv: Arizona?

00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:53.680
NC: Oh I do hope there's more secretary from Ghostbusters reboot material with him!

00:10:53.680 --> 00:11:01.020
Speaking of coincidence, they ALL happen to be in New York at the exact same time, but Kevin JUST misses them passing them in the street.

00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.020
causing Marv to bump into someone.

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:05.680
Marv: *speaking French*

00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:09.120
Harry: Serves you right! C'mon lets go!

00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.420
NC: Why did that anger him so much?

00:11:11.420 --> 00:11:16.040
This is a guy who breaks into God knows how many houses and almost commits child murder

00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:18.400
yet, speaking French to a woman was too far?

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.760
Imagine how he'd react to this guy

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:22.760
*speaking French*

00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.760
*gunshots*

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:29.560
NC: Kevin makes his way to the famous Plaza Hotel

00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.680
but, not before coming across a disturbing character?

00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.720
Kevin: SICK!

00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.400
NC: Why?

00:11:42.400 --> 00:11:46.300
I mean, okay this is obviously a retrend of the old man gimmick from the first one

00:11:46.300 --> 00:11:50.020
but, he had a creepy backstory and could at times look very scary.

00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:55.180
This is a Susan Boyle and Mrs. Doubtfire hybrid, she doesn't look the least bit frightening!

00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:57.740
I-Is it because she has birds? Is that it!?

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.500
Birds aren't scary; You're literally feeding them in a later scene!

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.520
If it were bats, it'd be scary. If it was insects,it'd be scary. If it was rats- anything but BIRDS!

00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:10.240
There's lierally a Mary Poppins song  about this scenario!

00:12:10.520 --> 00:12:13.880
It is famously charming and NOT THE LEAST BIT INTIMIDATING!

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.440
WHO KNOWS!? Maybe it was meant to be a horror film!

00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:21.260
He finally makes it to the hotel where he comes across a...

00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:22.540
ahem...

00:12:22.680 --> 00:12:24.680
'Interesting' cameo...
