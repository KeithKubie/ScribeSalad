00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:03.200
We're asked to
multiply 1.45 times 10

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.900
to the eighth times 9.2 times
10 to the negative 12th times

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.880
3.01 times 10 to
the negative fifth

00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:11.920
and express the product in
both decimal and scientific

00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:13.040
notation.

00:00:13.040 --> 00:00:19.760
So this is 1.45 times 10
to the eighth power times--

00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:22.374
and I could just write the
parentheses again like this,

00:00:22.374 --> 00:00:24.790
but I'm just going to write
it as another multiplication--

00:00:24.790 --> 00:00:29.970
times 9.2 times 10
to the negative 12th

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:37.620
and then times 3.01 times
10 to the negative fifth.

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:40.722
All this meant, when I wrote
these parentheses times next

00:00:40.722 --> 00:00:42.430
to each other, I'm
just going to multiply

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:44.010
this expression
times this expression

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.330
times this expression.

00:00:45.330 --> 00:00:47.590
And since everything is
involved multiplication,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:51.020
it actually doesn't matter
what order I multiply in.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:53.470
And so with that in mind,
I can swap the order here.

00:00:53.470 --> 00:00:57.390
This is going to be the
same thing as 1.45-- that's

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:09.530
that right there-- times
9.2 times 3.01 times

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:11.370
10 to the eighth--
let me do that

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:18.490
in that purple color-- times
10 to the eighth times 10

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:24.910
to the negative 12th power times
10 to the negative fifth power.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:30.750
And this is useful
because now I have

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:32.850
all of my powers of
10 right over here.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.720
I could put parentheses
around that.

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:38.460
And I have all my non-powers
of 10 right over there.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:39.730
And so I can simplify it.

00:01:39.730 --> 00:01:42.750
If I have the same base
10 right over here,

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:44.620
so I can add the exponents.

00:01:44.620 --> 00:01:52.320
This is going to be 10 to
the 8 minus 12 minus 5 power.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.160
And then all of this
on the left-hand side--

00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:02.187
let me get a calculator
out-- I have 1.45.

00:02:02.187 --> 00:02:04.520
You could do it by hand, but
this is a little bit faster

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:08.850
and less likely to make a
careless mistake-- times 9.2

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:17.620
times 3.01, which
is equal to 40.1534.

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:22.380
So this is equal to 40.1534.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.810
And of course, this is going
to be multiplied times 10

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:25.950
to this thing.

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:27.710
And so if we simplify
this exponent,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:33.630
you get 40.1534 times
10 to the 8 minus 12

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.520
is negative 4, minus
5 is negative 9.

00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:39.180
10 to the negative 9 power.

00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:41.470
Now you might be tempted
to say that this is already

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.150
in scientific notation because
I have some number here

00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:45.950
times some power of 10.

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:49.820
But this is not quite
official scientific notation.

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:51.530
And that's because
in order for it

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:55.700
to be in scientific notation,
this number right over here

00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.060
has to be greater than or
equal to 1 and less than 10.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:03.420
And this is, obviously,
not less than 10.

00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:05.860
Essentially, for it to be
in scientific notation,

00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:08.495
you want a non-zero
digit right over here.

00:03:08.495 --> 00:03:10.120
And then you want
your decimal and then

00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.850
the rest of everything else.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:15.710
So here-- and you want
a non-zero single digit

00:03:15.710 --> 00:03:16.210
over here.

00:03:16.210 --> 00:03:18.930
Here we obviously
have two digits.

00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:22.910
This is larger than 10-- or this
is greater than or equal to 10.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.280
You want this thing
to be less than 10

00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.959
and greater than or equal to 1.

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:30.000
So the best way to do that
is to write this thing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.260
right over here in
scientific notation.

00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:40.200
This is the same thing
as 4.01534 times 10.

00:03:40.200 --> 00:03:43.480
And one way to think about
it is to go from 40 to 4,

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:46.990
we have to move this
decimal over to the left.

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:49.400
Moving a decimal over to
the left to go from 40 to 4

00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:50.580
you're dividing by 10.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:53.470
So you have to multiply by
10 so it all equals out.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:55.539
Divide by 10 and
then multiply by 10.

00:03:55.539 --> 00:03:58.080
Or another way to write it, or
another way to think about it,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.820
is 4.0 and all this stuff times
10 is going to be 40.1534.

00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:06.260
And so you're going to have
4-- all of this times 10

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:11.120
to the first power, that's
the same thing as 10-- times

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:15.070
this thing-- times 10 to
the negative ninth power.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.640
And then once
again, powers of 10,

00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.890
so it's 10 to the first
times 10 to the negative 9

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:24.800
is going to be 10 to the
negative eighth power.

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:31.780
And we still have this 4.01534
times 10 to the negative 8.

00:04:31.780 --> 00:04:38.490
And now we have written
it in scientific notation.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:39.865
Now, they wanted
us to express it

00:04:39.865 --> 00:04:42.570
in both decimal and
scientific notation.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.150
And when they're asking us to
write it in decimal notation,

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:48.810
they essentially want us to
multiply this out, expand this

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:49.610
out.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:53.140
And so the way to think about
it-- write these digits out.

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.020
So I have 4, 0, 1, 5, 3, 4.

00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.900
And if I'm just
looking at this number,

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:02.420
I start with the
decimal right over here.

00:05:02.420 --> 00:05:08.360
Now, every time I divide by
10, or if I multiply by 10

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:12.520
to the negative 1, I'm moving
this over to the left one spot.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.290
So 10 to the negative
1-- if I multiply by 10

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:18.630
to the negative 1, that's the
same thing as dividing by 10.

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.440
And so I'm moving the
decimal over to the left one.

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:24.490
Here I'm multiplying by
10 to the negative 8.

00:05:24.490 --> 00:05:27.960
Or you could say I'm dividing
by 10 to the eighth power.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:30.901
So I'm going to want to move
the decimal to the left eight

00:05:30.901 --> 00:05:31.400
times.

00:05:41.749 --> 00:05:43.165
And one way to
remember it-- look,

00:05:43.165 --> 00:05:46.340
this is a very, very,
very, very small number.

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:48.860
If I multiply this, I
should get a smaller number.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.360
So I should be moving
the decimal to the left.

00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:53.510
If this was a
positive 8, then this

00:05:53.510 --> 00:05:55.440
would be a very large number.

00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:57.510
And so if I multiply
by a large power of 10,

00:05:57.510 --> 00:05:59.510
I'm going to be moving
the decimal to the right.

00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:02.790
So this whole thing
should evaluate

00:06:02.790 --> 00:06:06.960
to being smaller than 4.01534.

00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.010
So I move the decimal
eight times to the left.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.770
I move it one time to the left
to get it right over here.

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.890
And then the next seven times,
I'm just going to add 0's.

00:06:16.890 --> 00:06:22.710
So one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven 0's.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:25.510
And I'll put a 0 in front of
the decimal just to clarify it.

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:29.020
So now I notice, if you include
this digit right over here,

00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:30.910
I have a total of eight digits.

00:06:33.930 --> 00:06:36.835
I have seven 0's, and
this digit gives us eight.

00:06:36.835 --> 00:06:41.494
So again, one, two, three,
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:06:41.494 --> 00:06:42.910
The best way to
think about it is,

00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.630
I started with the
decimal right here.

00:06:44.630 --> 00:06:50.510
I moved once, twice, three,
four, five, six, seven,

00:06:50.510 --> 00:06:51.520
eight times.

00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.730
That's what multiplying times
10 to the negative 8 did for us.

00:06:54.730 --> 00:06:57.060
And I get this number
right over here.

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.560
And when you see a
number like this,

00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.720
you start to appreciate
why we rewrite things

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.920
in scientific notation.

00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:06.090
This is much easier to-- it
takes less space to write

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:09.020
and you immediately know
roughly how big this number is.

00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:10.810
This is much harder to write.

00:07:10.810 --> 00:07:12.420
You might even
forget a 0 when you

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:14.400
write it or you might add a 0.

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:17.410
And now the person has to sit
and count the 0's to figure out

00:07:17.410 --> 00:07:20.950
essentially how large--or get
a rough sense of how large this

00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:21.450
thing is.

00:07:21.450 --> 00:07:24.660
It's one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven 0's, and you

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.940
have this digit right here.

00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:27.440
That's what gets
us to that eight.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.250
But this is a much, much more
complicated-looking number

00:07:31.250 --> 00:07:34.076
than the one in
scientific notation.
