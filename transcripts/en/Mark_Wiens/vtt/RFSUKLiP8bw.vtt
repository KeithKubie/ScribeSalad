Hey everyone! It's Mark Wiens with migrationology.com in Singapore

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:07.960
Right now, I'm at the Tekka Centre which is a

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:13.680
wonderful food court hawker centre/shopping centre

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:21.660
of all things in Little India and it's one of the best places to come if you are looking for Indian food

00:00:25.240 --> 00:00:27.880
This is a very popular market and food centre

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.460
just immediately right off the Little India MRT Station

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:34.840
And it's right in Little India in Singapore

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.580
On the bottom floor, is a big food centre

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:40.960
Which is a giant food court open air food court

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:46.280
and while there are some Chinese food dishes stalls available

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.920
The majority of the stalls at this hawker centre are all Indian

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:54.920
and there's some Malay as well, but really I think it really focuses on the Indian Stalls

00:00:55.100 --> 00:01:01.240
So if you are looking for curry, if you are looking for prata, if you are looking for biryani rice

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:04.720
This is one of the ultimate places to come in Singapore

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:10.000
And then also on the other side, there is a fresh market where you can get all sorts of produce

00:01:10.060 --> 00:01:14.320
and then there are also a lot of shopping stalls where you can buy clothes

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:20.260
This is kind of an all in one Indian shopping centre and food court in the heart of Singapore

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.300
One of the things that i had to order was roti prata

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.460
and this is a prata i got it with an egg and onions on the inside

00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.320
He stretched out the dough and then added an egg and some onions into the middle

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.160
and then folded it into a little package and he fried it up fresh

00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:39.620
I'm gonna eat this right now because it is hot and fresh

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:41.360
and served with a curry sauce

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:49.540
Oh yes! All of the aroma! Oh that's really hot, okay we just break into that

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:56.120
Oh you can, wow that's even hot to touch, you can smell that aroma the onions and the egg in there

00:01:56.300 --> 00:01:58.540
Go for a quick dip in the curry sauce

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:15.340
Oh that's just awesomely good! The roti it is a little bit crispy on the edges, but most of the roti is just kind of sticky and doughy

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:23.720
and then the inside is filled with an egg as well as onions which are very fragrant and still a little bit crisp

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.180
and then yeah definitely taking it to the next level as that curry sauce

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:33.740
That's where a lot of flavor comes from and the curry sauce is not spicy, it's mild

00:02:34.260 --> 00:02:38.160
But it really goes well together with that plain roti

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.040
This makes a great breakfast, because it's kind of an all in one little meal

00:02:44.320 --> 00:02:46.880
And with your eggs inside there as well

00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:55.120
That's just simple and good!

00:02:56.760 --> 00:03:03.580
Another one of the stalls here at Tekka Centre that I was really looking forward to try was Allaudin's nasi biryani

00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:07.980
and they specialize in dum biryani and when you walk up to the front there,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:16.280
you can just smell the aroma of the spices, you can see the giant pots that they cook the rice and the chicken in

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:23.160
and so I ordered a plate and what he did was he really carefully dished out some rice onto the plate,

00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.080
just a couple scoops at first and then after that he topped it with a piece of chicken,

00:03:27.100 --> 00:03:31.860
and then after that he went back to the pot of rice and scooped on some more rice on top of that,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:35.700
so the chicken is sort of sandwiched between two layers of rice,

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.340
and then after that I had it, I got an egg on the side,

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:42.720
and then he served it with a side bowl of curry sauce

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:51.660
And so this is the complete dish, the rice is very orange and yellow colorful long strands of basmati rice

00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:57.180
There are onions in here, the aroma's fantastic! I also got it with an egg on the side,

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.500
and I'm just gonna try some of that rice first

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.800
Oh that rice has a beautiful fragrance to it,

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:16.560
I think I can taste some cardamom in there, maybe some cloves and definitely some cumin

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:20.800
The rice is a little bit of moist, it really depends on what type of biryani you have,

00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:25.380
sometimes it's more dry, other times this one is a little more on the moist side

00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:30.440
and also you can really taste those onions really fragrant onions in that rice as well,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:37.980
is that a chicken leg I believe? I can't even Oh! Look at how tender that chicken just slipped off!

00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:43.360
Oh look at that! And I better take a bite with just some of that sauce before I go into the curry sauce

00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:56.520
That chicken is so soft and tender! Sometimes when a chicken is really really soft,

00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:00.900
it tends to get mushy and sort of like starchy almost,

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:05.780
but somehow this chicken is ridiculouly soft, but it's not mushy at all,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:08.940
and it's just brilliant! Wow!

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:14.440
And then with that curry sauce, and then with that spiced fragrant rice,

00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:17.240
that is just simply a marvelous combination!

00:05:17.240 --> 00:05:19.240
Add some of that curry sauce to the egg,

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.220
Oh yeah! It's a chunky curry sauce, there are curry leaves in here and there is potatoes in here as well

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:37.280
Those curry leaves are brilliant!

00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.420
The curry sauce has a really nice fragrant from the curry leaves used in there,

00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:44.980
and I believe that there's also eggplant in that curry sauce,

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:50.840
which has been cooked for so long that it started to dissolve into the curry sauce,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.340
so it's almost kind of thickened by that eggplant

00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:07.060
That was a great plate of nasi biryani! And I'm still amazed that how the chicken was so soft,

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:10.340
but the texture remains really good and not mushy

00:06:10.340 --> 00:06:14.260
That was delicious! And really this entire Tekka Centre,

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:18.200
it's a wonderful wonderful place to come if you love Indian food,

00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:24.680
I notice mostly South Indian food, but really a broad spectrum of different dishes to order,

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:32.760
lots of stalls and when you walk around you can just smell the aroma of those spices within the humidity of the air of Singapore

00:06:32.760 --> 00:06:39.480
It's beautiful! I want to thank all of you who recommended the Tekka Centre to come for to eat,

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:44.480
this is a wonderful place and I appreciate you all recommending it
