Fifth Doctor:
"I'm the Doctor..."

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:13.300
You know his face...es

00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:15.140

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.780
First Doctor:
"My truth is in the stars."

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:21.180
Unless you're not from the United Kingdom.

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.020
Then you probably don't know any of those things.

00:00:23.020 --> 00:00:26.640
Now, relive over 30 years of classic sci-fi television

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.340

[MANIACAL CLOWN LAUGHTER]

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.340
Classic Doctor Who

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:42.000
Meet the Doctor.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.980
A Time Lord from the planet Gallifrey who travels through space-time in a machine called the TARDIS.

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.700
And if that's already too weird for you, tap out now.

00:00:49.700 --> 00:00:52.100
Because it's about to get a whole lot weirder.

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:54.820
Seventh Doctor:
"We're on the planet of the cheetah people, intelligent carnivores."

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.040
Journey through three decades of adventure

00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:57.920
as the show

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.400
-er, I mean, the Doctor-

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.960
keeps things fresh by regenerating into new bodies every few years.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:03.860
Like...

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.740
The crabby old man Doctor.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:07.100
First Doctor:
Hold that and shut up, will you?

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:09.160
The Beatle-haircut childlike Doctor.

00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:12.060
General:
"You've caused me a great deal of trouble!"

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:14.120
Second Doctor:
"Good! I'm very glad to hear it!"

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.580
The snake-tatted, kung-fu, Austin Powers Doctor.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:23.240
The "this is what most people think all of classic Doctor Who is" Doctor.

00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:25.340
Fourth Doctor:
"Have a jelly baby, and don't forget to brush your teeth."

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:27.280
The "he seems nice" Doctor.

00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.920
Fifth Doctor:
"It's absolutely splendid!"

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:31.440
The "kind of arrogant even for the Doctor" Doctor.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:32.740
SIxth Doctor:
"Ah..."

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.900
Sixth Doctor:
"A noble brow."

00:01:34.900 --> 00:01:37.660
The "almost-out-of-gas-coasting-on goodwill" Doctor.

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:39.320
Seventh Doctor:
"Yeti, Autons, Daleks."

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.700
Seventh Doctor:
"Cybermen and Silurians!"

00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.360
And the TV movie one-off George Lazenby Doctor.

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.480
Eighth Doctor:
WHO

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:46.080
Eighth Doctor:

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:48.800
Eighth Doctor:
I?!

00:01:49.360 --> 00:01:51.760
But no matter which Doctor is operating the TARDIS,

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.420
one thing remains constant:

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:57.140
He is either the most overrated or underrated Doctor of all time

00:01:57.140 --> 00:02:00.440
in either the most overrated or underrated era of the show.

00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.060
Okay, look.

00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:03.360
Getting Doctor Who fans to agree on who's the best Doctor

00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:05.640
is like trying to watch every episode of Doctor Who.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.060
It's pretty much impossible.

00:02:07.060 --> 00:02:08.740
So why even try?

00:02:09.140 --> 00:02:13.540
Watch as the Doctor and his companions take on some of the most iconic villains of all time.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:14.780
Like the Daleks.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:19.160
Black Dalek:
Exterminate him! Exterminate him! Exterminate him!

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:20.440

"Doctor."

00:02:23.340 --> 00:02:25.880
And the evil Time Lord, the Master.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:30.400
[INSANE LAUGHTER]

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:35.040
Then spend the other 90% of the show watching whatever villains the crew could throw together on a low budget.

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:35.840
Like...

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:37.260
Killer mannequins!

00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:38.660
Third Doctor:
"Look out! Auton!"

00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.500
The bubble wrap monster!

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.000

00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:03.360

The Inflatable Plastic Chair of Doom!

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:13.140
And some villains that it sounds like they're just making up on the spot.

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:15.180
Third Doctor:
"They're Dæmons from the planet Dæmos!"

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.860
Watch them face off in stories serialized across three, four, six, or even ten episodes

00:03:19.860 --> 00:03:21.880
jam-packed with enough plot to fill...

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:23.060
maybe two?

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.420
Dalek 1:
"We know the Thals are able to live on the surface."

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.420
Dalek 2:
"And that they must have got immunity."

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:31.740
Dalek 1:
"Perhaps it is a drug."

00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:34.460
Dalek 1:
"Is it failing them now?"

00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:35.600
Dalek 1:
"Why are these-"

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.700
Come on, Whovians.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:38.380
Even you have to admit, this show is very

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.360
deliberate

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:40.660
...ly drawn out.

00:03:42.470 --> 00:03:45.300
Witness the paradox that is classic Doctor Who.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.880
A show that's both timeless

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:48.400
and completely out of date.

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.600
First Doctor:
"What you need is a jolly good smacked bottom!"

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.840
Thrill as it seems to predict future phenomena like "The Matrix".

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.180
Fourth:
"Goth must have his own link with the Matrix!"

00:03:56.180 --> 00:03:57.180
The Borg.

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.620
Dalek:
RESISTANCE IS USELESS.

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.340
Cyberman:
This trial is futile.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:03.520
Stephen King.

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:05.480
First Doctor:
"I shall have to go to the Dark Tower."

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:06.220
And

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:06.920
"Bee Movie"?

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:10.780
Third Doctor:
"According to classical aerodynamics, it is impossible for a bumblebee to fly!"

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:13.920
While also being completely inappropriate for modern times.

00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.060
Henry Gordon Jago:
"For one thing, I could swear he was a Chinese."

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:19.160

"I feel no pain. The opium..."

00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:20.700

"Are they all Chinese?"

Jago:
"Gutter scrapings of Shanghai!"

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.360
Fourth Doctor:
"And one midget."

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:25.820
And that's just from the episode The Talons of Weng Chiang!

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.520
Li H'sen Chang:
"I understand we all look the same."

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.200
Wow.

00:04:30.420 --> 00:04:34.260
So if you like TV shows that you can easily kick back and watch on Netflix,

00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.620
then definitely DON'T start watching Doctor Who.

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:39.460
The Robot:
I am confused!

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.940
As this completionist nightmare will send you scrambling

00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:44.480
to find episodes that the BBC erased decades ago

00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:47.040
by hunting down dozens of DVD boxsets,

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:48.280
animated recreations,

00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:49.500
and audio plays

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.880
while you secretly pray that all of it just magically turns up like those episodes from Africa.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:57.980
But if you do somehow make it through all 26 series, specials, and TV movies,

00:04:57.980 --> 00:04:59.120
then answer me this:

00:04:59.120 --> 00:05:02.440
Why do Doctor Who fans get so angry every time people call him Doctor Who?

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.440
Fourth Doctor:
"I'm the Doctor! I keep telling you that!"

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:08.020
When that's what the SHOW called him for EIGHTEEN YEARS!

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.260
First Doctor:
"You don't understand."

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.500
First Doctor:
I knew you wouldn't! Never mind."

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.160
Dalek:
UNDER ATTACK!

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:50.780

"They're about to transfer their crystal to the Hecate

00:05:53.300 --> 00:05:55.700
"the more the thoughts will doubt you the more you must

Convince all flock that you are -doctor who refernece-"

and you're both nuts Ayutthaya, dr. Su turn around I'm content

00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.280

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:18.700
You found the inner conta- compartment containing three Daleks?!

00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.440
"The accumulation of evidence is

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.440
overwhelming"

00:06:25.240 --> 00:06:27.240
Sacrifice

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:56.400
Okay, okay, I'll do anything how this is the Big Finish audio place I watched k9 and company just make it stop

00:07:04.780 --> 00:07:08.040
So the sonic screwdriver that's basically just a fancy door opener, right

00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:13.620
Yep, that's what I thought

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:15.540
Now that you know the doctors history

00:07:15.540 --> 00:07:22.140

Hello, I'm the doctor. Would you like a jelly, baby?
