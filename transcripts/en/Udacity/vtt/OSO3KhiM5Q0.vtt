00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:03.020
So let's quickly review which properties I indexed.

00:00:04.460 --> 00:00:07.520
The name property's indexed. We're very likely going to

00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:10.830
want to search for conferences by name. The description

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.180
property is not indexed. We're not going to query

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:17.055
for the conferences by description. And it's actually fairly

00:00:17.055 --> 00:00:19.590
typical, that if a property is going to have possibly

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.420
a long text string as its value, that you're

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:26.310
not going to index it. And city is indexed.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.510
We're going to want to query the conferences by city.

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:31.600
For example, which conference is taking in place in Tokyo?

00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:35.720
Which ones in San Francisco? In our case, the start

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.320
date is not going to be indexed. It's not that unlikely

00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:42.040
that you might want to query conferences by start date.

00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:43.990
It's just that in our case, we're not going to do

00:00:43.990 --> 00:00:47.210
that. Now you could have figured out which properties are

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:51.380
indexed, by looking in the source code for conference. For example,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:56.030
we see that name is indexed. Description doesn't have

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:59.920
the @index annotation. So it's not indexed. And so

00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:02.010
on, for the rest of the fields. But an

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:04.769
easier way to check once you've actually created some conferences,

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.630
is just to look in the Data Store Viewer.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:10.190
And the Data Store Viewer shows you which properties are

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.990
not indexed, by this little unindexed annotation. You've probably

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.670
already seen this. And that just means that the property's

00:01:16.670 --> 00:01:19.740
not going to be indexed. You don't have to be Sherlock Holmes

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:22.350
to figure out that the converse is true. If you don't see

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:26.280
that @index mark here, then the property is going to be indexed. So

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.960
here we can tell that max attendees is going to be indexed. Now

00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:33.550
that we've got some conferences, we can go ahead and learn how

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:36.460
to query on them. And Magnusson's going to talk to you about the

00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:39.630
different types of queries. And then I'll talk you through how to

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:42.610
write the code to write the queries. See you in a minute.
