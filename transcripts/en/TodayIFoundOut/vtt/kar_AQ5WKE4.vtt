00:00:12.259 --> 00:00:17.910
Subject to the same rules of the road as other
drivers, with a few exceptions for emergencies,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.739
ambulances can be pulled over and ticketed
for speeding and other traffic violations,

00:00:22.739 --> 00:00:24.990
although it is exceedingly rare.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:29.279
Generally speaking, ambulance drivers should
observe all traffic laws and regulations;

00:00:29.279 --> 00:00:34.530
however, some of those laws are waived when
the ambulance needs to respond to an emergency

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:35.530
(sometimes called “Code 3”).

00:00:35.530 --> 00:00:39.079
Typical exceptions (which usually apply to
other emergency response vehicles like fire

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:43.559
trucks as well), include: (1) allowing the
vehicle to park or “stand” pretty much

00:00:43.559 --> 00:00:47.640
anywhere the driver puts it; (2) blowing red
lights and stop signs – after ensuring it’s

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:51.850
safe to do so (and slowing down); (3) driving
in the “wrong” lane or the “wrong”

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:57.370
way up a street or through an intersection;
and (4) exceeding the maximum speed limit.

00:00:57.370 --> 00:01:01.629
Depending on the jurisdiction, with the exception
concerning speed, some limit it to 10 miles

00:01:01.629 --> 00:01:06.640
per hour (mph) over the speed limit, others
15 mph, and still others leave it to the driver’s

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:11.409
discretion “so long as (s)he does not endanger
life or property.”

00:01:11.409 --> 00:01:15.981
In addition, again depending on the location,
many states and localities require that the

00:01:15.981 --> 00:01:20.750
vehicle “make use of visual signs,” i.e.
have its lights on and some may prefer the

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.460
siren to be blaring as well.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:27.290
However, even in places where the siren is
supposed to be on, medics may choose to turn

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.420
it off, since the sound may disturb some patients
(as one EMT said, it “makes the patient

00:01:32.420 --> 00:01:33.430
freak out.”)

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:38.450
Note that some of the exceptions to the basic
traffic laws have vague language, and the

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.910
interpretation depends on your perspective.

00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.531
According to one EMT whose crew was attempting
to reach a site expeditiously, the driver

00:01:45.531 --> 00:01:49.930
chose to “oppose traffic” (presumably
drive the wrong way down the street) for about

00:01:49.930 --> 00:01:56.220
300 feet, driving about 15 mph; obviously,
that driver made the judgment call that do

00:01:56.220 --> 00:01:58.110
so was safe.

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:02.300
Unfortunately for him, a police officer who
observed this made a different judgment call,

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:05.560
that it wasn’t, and pulled the ambulance
over; while she did not give the ambulance

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:09.599
driver a ticket, she did hold it at the location
well past the time for the call and, we can

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:13.670
only hope, another ambulance was dispatched
to the emergency.

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.940
Since ambulances are expected to behave as
other vehicles when not responding to an emergency,

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:24.819
if they are approached by an emergency responder,
like everyone else, they are expected to pull

00:02:24.819 --> 00:02:26.150
over too.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:31.180
In a 2009 incident in Oklahoma, an ambulance
that did not have its lights or sirens running

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:35.230
was pulled over by a state trooper after it
failed to give the trooper the right of way

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:37.209
when he was attempting to respond to a call.

00:02:37.209 --> 00:02:38.209
According to the trooper, the ambulance driver
also flipped him off, so the trooper pulled

00:02:38.209 --> 00:02:39.209
him over.

00:02:39.209 --> 00:02:41.659
It turned out that the ambulance was transporting
a patient, but was not running either the

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:44.319
lights or the siren in an effort to keep the
patient calm.

00:02:44.319 --> 00:02:48.680
So, as soon as the ambulance stopped, the
lead medic emerged from the ambulance to discuss

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:52.760
the situation with the trooper, but the latter
was too incensed to listen.

00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:57.269
An altercation ensued, which escalated to
the point where the trooper grabbed the medic

00:02:57.269 --> 00:02:58.480
by the neck.

00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:02.230
The incident was caught on camera (by the
patient’s family who were travelling behind

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:05.159
the ambulance), and the trooper was suspended.

00:03:05.159 --> 00:03:09.530
Historically, the medical community has held
to the belief that there is a “golden hour,”

00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:13.409
in which serious trauma patients who make
it to a hospital within 60 minutes of being

00:03:13.409 --> 00:03:17.639
injured are much more likely to survive, and
that the faster the patient makes it to the

00:03:17.639 --> 00:03:18.639
ER, generally, the better.

00:03:18.639 --> 00:03:19.750
For example, some say that Princess Diana,
who died in 1997, could have been saved had

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:20.750
the ambulance not taken 40 minutes to transport
her to the hospital (some say it could’ve

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:21.750
made the trip in 5 minutes, but took so long
due to French emergency procedures).

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.750
However, recent research is challenging the
assumptions behind “faster is better,”

00:03:22.750 --> 00:03:23.750
in regards to the “EMS interval.”

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:24.750
In a 2010 study published in the Annals of
Emergency Medicine, after looking into the

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:27.989
time it took over 3,000 trauma patients to
make it to the hospital and their outcomes,

00:03:27.989 --> 00:03:34.049
the study revealed that, extremely counter-intuitively,
“shorter intervals did not appear to improve

00:03:34.049 --> 00:03:35.049
survival.”

00:03:35.049 --> 00:03:38.719
However, according to the Chairman of the
London Ambulance Service, Sigurd Reinton,

00:03:38.719 --> 00:03:42.959
even a minor delay from things like speed
bumps kills numerous people every year by

00:03:42.959 --> 00:03:45.439
slowing emergency vehicles.

00:03:45.439 --> 00:03:49.239
This is a notion backed up by a study done
by Ronald Bowman in Boulder, Colorado that

00:03:49.239 --> 00:03:53.889
indicated that for every life saved by various
traffic slowing measures like speed bumps,

00:03:53.889 --> 00:03:58.439
an astounding 85 people die because of this
slowing effect on emergency vehicles, whether

00:03:58.439 --> 00:04:36.400
inherently, like in speed bumps, or by jamming
up traffic.
