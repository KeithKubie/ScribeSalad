00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:04.132
Looking to the left of the graph, just before we reach 0, it looks like we fall

00:00:04.132 --> 00:00:08.356
way below negative infinity, and just after x equals 0, the graph reappears way

00:00:08.356 --> 00:00:15.256
up high, and then comes back down for positive infinity. So, as we approach x

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:18.469
equals 0 from the left the graph falls low, but as we approach from the right,

00:00:18.469 --> 00:00:20.570
it rises way high.
