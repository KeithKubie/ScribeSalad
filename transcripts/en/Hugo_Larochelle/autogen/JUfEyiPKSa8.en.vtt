00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.339
 in this capsule we will see 

00:00:01.439 --> 00:00:06.450
 the algorithm the c3 so we saw up 

00:00:05.339 --> 00:00:08.460
 now that it was possible 

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:09.870
 to incorporate heuristics sound 

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.450
 general in the bach algorithm 

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:13.710
 tracking search on has three types of 

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:15.509
 risks and we have heuristics 

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.039
 sure were commenting on what we choose 

00:00:15.509 --> 00:00:19.830
 next barrier it was the method 

00:00:17.039 --> 00:00:22.230
 varna signed desert on comment this 

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:25.439
 we choose and how are we 

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:28.289
 actually orders the values ​​signed for 

00:00:25.439 --> 00:00:30.750
 the variable chooses so that was the 

00:00:28.289 --> 00:00:33.840
 orderly value method in our local 

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:35.340
 and we saw a difference algorithm 

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:37.380
 that is to say the flu that allows 

00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:39.540
 detect the assignments that are 

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.910
 conflictual and detect them in advance 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.510
 and which also helps to reduce 

00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:46.110
 domains of variants assigned for 

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:48.510
 speed up the search 

00:00:46.110 --> 00:00:50.309
 so what we want to see is actually 

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:54.649
 another inference algorithm that is going 

00:00:50.309 --> 00:00:57.930
 to be a little more powerful so 

00:00:54.649 --> 00:00:59.370
 the algorithm fore-checking they work 

00:00:57.930 --> 00:01:01.949
 still pretty well it's pretty 

00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:04.619
 simple is what we saw what they 

00:01:01.949 --> 00:01:07.380
 propagate information about 

00:01:04.619 --> 00:01:10.350
 constraints between variables signed 

00:01:07.380 --> 00:01:13.470
 to variables that are not yet at 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:16.530
 sign however it does not detect if there 

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:18.240
 is not currently conflict that we are going 

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:19.920
 create local conflicts between 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:21.780
 variables are not yet to sign that's 

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.640
 to say that every time we check is 

00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.670
 what it detects a conflict between a 

00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:28.560
 unassigned variable is a variable a 

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.530
 signed but not between the non variables 

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.900
 assigned germany we have an example here 

00:01:31.530 --> 00:01:36.170
 imagine that we do the research bac 

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:40.170
 jacking either one is here in our 

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:42.540
 note research and we have these areas there 

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:46.530
 that have been updated with 

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:48.210
 the jacking algorithm so currently 

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:50.460
 for rich who does not tell us to stop 

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:54.470
 research however we notice if we 

00:01:50.460 --> 00:01:59.189
 consider the pair of variables nts a 

00:01:54.470 --> 00:02:03.479
 so we have their domain justice had 

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:05.219
 between who is here and who are 

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:07.259
 variants correspond to states that 

00:02:05.219 --> 00:02:08.550
 share a border right here so 

00:02:07.259 --> 00:02:10.770
 they must not take the same value 

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:12.599
 however in their field we see that 

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:13.180
 the only values ​​that both 

00:02:12.599 --> 00:02:14.709
 variables 

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:16.989
 it's exactly the same value 

00:02:14.709 --> 00:02:18.189
 ie blue so at that moment it's 

00:02:16.989 --> 00:02:19.329
 in fact we could have stopped 

00:02:18.189 --> 00:02:21.430
 search right now because we know 

00:02:19.329 --> 00:02:25.060
 will never understand solve this problem 

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:27.129
 there by making other assignments of 

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:29.439
 variables of values ​​and in what we 

00:02:27.129 --> 00:02:31.930
 will see if an inference algorithm that 

00:02:29.439 --> 00:02:34.000
 will spread information about 

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:35.680
 constraints between non variables 

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.780
 assigned and that will allow precisely 

00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.189
 to check locally 6th not 

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:41.709
 conflicts between variables that have no 

00:02:39.189 --> 00:02:43.989
 still been assigned and so that's 

00:02:41.709 --> 00:02:45.040
 the algorithm to 6 3 6 that will do if 

00:02:43.989 --> 00:02:50.829
 was going to be we'll see in this 

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:54.930
 capsule then the ac3 algorithm is a 

00:02:50.829 --> 00:02:59.230
 algorithm that of horgues thus consists 

00:02:54.930 --> 00:03:01.030
 so this is a type one way to do 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:04.419
 the propagation constraints that is 

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:07.299
 rather simple the idea is to check 

00:03:04.419 --> 00:03:10.689
 compatibility between arches that's at 

00:03:07.299 --> 00:03:12.969
 say constraint relationships between 

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:14.709
 pardon the compatibility of contracts 

00:03:12.969 --> 00:03:16.599
 between two variables 

00:03:14.709 --> 00:03:18.400
 so I'm going to define what I want 

00:03:16.599 --> 00:03:21.909
 say by an arc that is compatible 

00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.889
 so if we have an arc x green y os x and y 

00:03:21.909 --> 00:03:25.359
 are variables going to say he's 

00:03:23.889 --> 00:03:28.900
 arc compatible anyone who is 

00:03:25.359 --> 00:03:32.799
 inconsistent if and only if for 

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:35.489
 each x value of the variable grown 

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:39.810
 there is at least one permitted value of 

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:42.400
 9 to allow y for the large variable y 

00:03:39.810 --> 00:03:44.620
 so that's the definition of an arc 

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.720
 which is compatible and in a slang 

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:47.799
 recoil rate system so what are we going 

00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:49.030
 to do with it is that every time 

00:03:47.799 --> 00:03:50.949
 we will make assignments 

00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:52.810
 we will change the areas of 

00:03:50.949 --> 00:03:55.120
 variables to make sure that all 

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:57.579
 against all the bows forgive all the 

00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:59.560
 arcs between two variables are combative 

00:03:57.579 --> 00:04:01.959
 so for all the variables we have 

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.970
 signed we will take all the arches 

00:04:01.959 --> 00:04:06.189
 so that means that are constrained 

00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:08.259
 as here in wa and mt 

00:04:06.189 --> 00:04:10.989
 we will make sure that the bow of w 

00:04:08.259 --> 00:04:12.669
 varieties and ntv w is compatible for 

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:16.470
 do that for all the constraints 

00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:18.540
 and specifically all of 

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:22.019
 father of variables that share a 

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:27.260
 constraint then an example here of an arc 

00:04:22.019 --> 00:04:29.520
 of the variable s is the variable nsw 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.650
 and the question is to know is this 

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.810
 that the arc in question is compatible 

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:36.870
 in that if it is compatible why 

00:04:33.810 --> 00:04:40.260
 for the only possible value of rsa that 

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:42.690
 is blue in fact we have a variable so 

00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:45.540
 this is the hic rexie pardon a value that 

00:04:42.690 --> 00:04:50.070
 correspond yz ci and who red in this 

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:52.290
 case that allows to assign is saab 

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:54.680
 so in other words it's gone 

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:58.490
 for me to assign blue saha 

00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:01.590
 since I could have assigned nsw to red 

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:02.880
 so because of that it's tahar kessi 

00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:06.230
 sisters veronique double life is 

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:12.390
 compatible I'm going to take off a bit of 

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:14.580
 clear let's look at another our bow so 

00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:17.669
 in that if the act of nsw would see his 

00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.950
 dance only if there are not compatible 

00:05:17.669 --> 00:05:23.490
 why because there is there is a 

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:26.460
 value x small ex so seven years that if 

00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:29.820
 it's the blue value for the variable 

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:33.930
 nsw which is such that there is none 

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:36.150
 no value of the variable is what 

00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:38.360
 allows to satisfy the constraint so 

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:41.880
 it's not possible for me to assinie 

00:05:38.360 --> 00:05:44.160
 nsw to blue and then assign n is not to 

00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.260
 one of its possible values 

00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.080
 the only possible value these blues then 

00:05:46.260 --> 00:05:52.500
 i can not see blue nsw and is healthy and 

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:54.570
 blue so arched not compatible then 

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.580
 what i'm doing in the ac3 algorithm 

00:05:54.570 --> 00:06:00.120
 know that I'm going to change the domain of 

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:01.710
 nsw for the art to become competitive 

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.910
 the way to do it is simply 

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:07.470
 remove blues from his domain from his 

00:06:05.910 --> 00:06:09.270
 permissible value area 

00:06:07.470 --> 00:06:12.090
 so if I do that because if the 

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:15.240
 just and the unfair red in like 

00:06:12.090 --> 00:06:17.790
 possible value of nsw and if I sign 

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.160
 nsw a red to assign is blue and 

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:22.970
 I will satisfy the constraint between 

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:25.680
 two so the arched made compatible 

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:28.270
 and I will continue like that they field 

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:31.330
 on all possible arcs 

00:06:28.270 --> 00:06:34.540
 variables not yet so remark 

00:06:31.330 --> 00:06:35.440
 however that before when I made the 

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.050
 comparison 

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:41.260
 ah yeah when i checked hes bow 

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:44.620
 so varane swg suppose the domain 

00:06:41.260 --> 00:06:46.990
 dns double nsw contained red and blue 

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.760
 because I just updated so 

00:06:46.990 --> 00:06:50.320
 to reduce the domain dns double life 

00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:52.420
 it's more the know w his domain 

00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:53.650
 that we just hold red then 

00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:55.840
 in the moss and troy booth I'm going 

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.970
 having to make sure to reconsider this art 

00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:01.900
 closed to them check because the 

00:06:57.970 --> 00:07:05.680
 domain of the variable sw laval towards 

00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.980
 which the bow points to change because 

00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:11.050
 that if we are lucky by changing the 

00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:14.170
 field of sw ans in the blue green a 

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:17.650
 do we still have that arc of s over nsw 

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:20.080
 is valid since red has stayed in 

00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:24.010
 the domain so that allows me to assign 

00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:24.970
 sandy by assigning nsw to left this 

00:07:24.010 --> 00:07:28.930
 means that the art that is still 

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:31.390
 competitive so the algorithm sit down 

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.550
 would continue to adhere on all 

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:37.330
 possible arcs suppose liberation 

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:40.630
 next two years and three we come to 

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:42.250
 this target arc in this case also the 

00:07:40.630 --> 00:07:44.230
 change in the domain we would do that 

00:07:42.250 --> 00:07:46.990
 would be to remove red since I can 

00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:49.000
 not to sign red vea because a 

00:07:46.990 --> 00:07:50.590
 mind can only be assigned to 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.790
 you because if we had a 

00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.630
 incompatibility then I'm going to remove 

00:07:51.790 --> 00:08:00.550
 red of the domain of the variable v by 

00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:02.950
 against I can keep green and blue 

00:08:00.550 --> 00:08:09.790
 since we reported this w to red 

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:11.890
 painted and signed vea to bhl and 

00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.750
 I'll continue like that so let's suppose 

00:08:11.890 --> 00:08:18.000
 that I now consider the arc of s to 

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:21.250
 vanves mt in that if I observe that 

00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.020
 I can not sign her anymore since 

00:08:21.250 --> 00:08:25.240
 there is no value dente that allows me 

00:08:23.020 --> 00:08:29.290
 to assign sandy the game should 

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:33.370
 remove from his field the blue value 

00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:35.080
 is there the ac3 algorithm would detect that 

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:38.320
 I have a domain that quickly makes it so 

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.900
 I detected a conflict and so my 

00:08:38.320 --> 00:08:42.700
 algae of inference will return this 

00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:44.350
 information-there will return a ball a 

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:46.360
 which means that you're going to say that a 

00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:47.860
 conflict that will happen 

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.750
 possibly that is impossible to 

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:52.500
 solve and so search for baxter 

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:55.990
 king sturge to stop there and back off 

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:59.320
 towards for example considering a 

00:08:55.990 --> 00:09:01.330
 new assignment of my variable here 

00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:05.700
 the sni rather than the age signare 

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:05.700
 could sign it to blue at red darcos 

00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:10.660
 so here's a slightly more formal way 

00:09:08.770 --> 00:09:13.210
 how does the algorithm work at these 

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:15.100
 three broke it's for arkoon 

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:18.100
 small right system is because 

00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:22.060
 exist different versions so we 

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.440
 is going to look at ac3 version then this 

00:09:22.060 --> 00:09:26.650
 that we do in rites to these three 

00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:29.320
 years starts by building a queue of 

00:09:26.650 --> 00:09:30.910
 all possible arches between pairs 

00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:34.720
 of variables that share a complete 

00:09:30.910 --> 00:09:38.350
 so I have to simplify if I have 

00:09:34.720 --> 00:09:40.900
 assumed that there is an arc function of the 

00:09:38.350 --> 00:09:45.100
 csp who takes my explain us 

00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:48.730
 return all the all the arcs between 

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:51.820
 but then sand variable I'm going 

00:09:48.730 --> 00:09:53.620
 interests on actually I'm not going 

00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:57.160
 only iterate on the arc queue but 

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:59.020
 I'm going ethereal until until 

00:09:57.160 --> 00:10:00.340
 what phil acts become fast so 

00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:01.889
 time so long that philippe is 

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:04.319
 not empty 

00:10:01.889 --> 00:10:06.720
 I will continue interest on what 

00:10:04.319 --> 00:10:08.459
 is contained by that he is at each 

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.160
 iteration what I do is that I 

00:10:08.459 --> 00:10:13.170
 take the first bow file element 

00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:18.989
 so in this case too an arc was 

00:10:13.170 --> 00:10:21.689
 offered my first variable xxi which 

00:10:18.989 --> 00:10:23.910
 point to the variable mj in my 

00:10:21.689 --> 00:10:25.109
 childhood ixic j it means that I have a 

00:10:23.910 --> 00:10:31.499
 arc xy 

00:10:25.109 --> 00:10:36.600
 around 6 am I'm disappointed I'll call the 

00:10:31.499 --> 00:10:38.609
 revised function for xy is required in 

00:10:36.600 --> 00:10:39.809
 also specifying the configuration of 

00:10:38.609 --> 00:10:42.449
 mons and inspire so it's the same 

00:10:39.809 --> 00:10:44.970
 function revise that we had seen in a 

00:10:42.449 --> 00:10:47.279
 previous capsule is it going to do 

00:10:44.970 --> 00:10:49.259
 this is precisely what is described before 

00:10:47.279 --> 00:10:50.819
 know I'll check for all 

00:10:49.259 --> 00:10:52.889
 values ​​of xxi è what exists a 

00:10:50.819 --> 00:10:54.720
 angie value that allows me to 

00:10:52.889 --> 00:10:57.209
 satisfy me constrained if it's not 

00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:59.689
 the case I remove this value from 

00:10:57.209 --> 00:11:01.470
 eksi domain the time I return 

00:10:59.689 --> 00:11:04.470
 information know what I changed 

00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:06.089
 the domain of eksi and I return the 

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:09.540
 new csp with domains 

00:11:06.089 --> 00:11:12.389
 possibly updated if domenech 

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:14.910
 if we changed and there as I had 

00:11:12.389 --> 00:11:17.339
 said beforehand I start with who is 

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:19.470
 what the xxi domain renders empty a 

00:11:17.339 --> 00:11:21.540
 little like in falling we do the same 

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:23.189
 something so obvious because if I 

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:25.199
 returns wrong said I return 

00:11:23.189 --> 00:11:28.319
 information know that there is a 

00:11:25.199 --> 00:11:29.610
 conflict that is detected and what will 

00:11:28.319 --> 00:11:32.179
 to do that bach tracking be I see 

00:11:29.610 --> 00:11:34.139
 do a jacques bac have to go back 

00:11:32.179 --> 00:11:37.230
 on the other hand if the domain is not yet 

00:11:34.139 --> 00:11:40.410
 empty what am I going to do in ac3 so 

00:11:37.230 --> 00:11:42.569
 a fore-checking I will continue in 

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:46.259
 improve nothing else to do by the 

00:11:42.569 --> 00:11:50.160
 continuation in consists here consists of six 

00:11:46.259 --> 00:11:53.309
 pardon to c3 for all 

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:57.119
 variables etc score who are neighbors 

00:11:53.309 --> 00:12:01.169
 of xxi so the set of variables that 

00:11:57.119 --> 00:12:02.309
 share a constraint with xxi for the 

00:12:01.169 --> 00:12:03.809
 we remember well here it's a 

00:12:02.309 --> 00:12:07.649
 variable for which the domain has 

00:12:03.809 --> 00:12:09.299
 changed six ex quo is a variable that 

00:12:07.649 --> 00:12:11.789
 is different from the variable etc if 

00:12:09.299 --> 00:12:13.529
 for which I have just made sure that 

00:12:11.789 --> 00:12:15.629
 arctic sea and j and k 

00:12:13.529 --> 00:12:16.800
 build but become compatible for 

00:12:15.629 --> 00:12:19.110
 other variables that share a 

00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.389
 constraint with etc if i'm going to add 

00:12:19.110 --> 00:12:28.009
 a bow 

00:12:20.389 --> 00:12:30.420
 I add an act x as to xy 

00:12:28.009 --> 00:12:33.629
 so adding the pair will educate 

00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:36.990
 Exquisite in my dark phil in this movie 

00:12:33.629 --> 00:12:42.059
 so I'm going to double-check the bow two ex 

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:43.620
 kovarik ci because ex body because 

00:12:42.059 --> 00:12:45.120
 the domain of xi has changed so that's 

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.550
 possible that now is late 

00:12:45.120 --> 00:12:49.470
 the dx kovac ci is no longer compatible 

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:52.379
 and that I have to reduce once again 

00:12:49.470 --> 00:12:55.740
 the domain of xk and that's a 

00:12:52.379 --> 00:12:59.189
 iteration of the c3 and I continue as 

00:12:55.740 --> 00:13:01.379
 that until the arc arch wire is 

00:12:59.189 --> 00:13:04.290
 made fast ie all the 

00:13:01.379 --> 00:13:05.189
 all the arches we are now 

00:13:04.290 --> 00:13:06.870
 compatible 

00:13:05.189 --> 00:13:11.639
 after reducing the areas of maize 

00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:13.559
 variable or the grid to stop if 

00:13:11.639 --> 00:13:18.000
 I detect a conflict ie if the 

00:13:13.559 --> 00:13:20.850
 domain of one for one of the arcs and xi 

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.529
 and xiie if the xxi domain has become 

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.449
 empty in this case I would go wrong 

00:13:22.529 --> 00:13:26.309
 then if not I would go back 

00:13:24.449 --> 00:13:27.930
 cabbage but I had managed to move on to 

00:13:26.309 --> 00:13:30.059
 through everything but bow and that was 

00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:34.050
 become compatible I will return with the 

00:13:30.059 --> 00:13:36.420
 new csp with the domains that have 

00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:38.069
 been simplified so that's 

00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:43.800
 the algorithm the pseudo that the algorithm 

00:13:38.069 --> 00:13:49.259
 ac3 some notes on the algorithm in 

00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:50.970
 so what can we do with 

00:13:49.259 --> 00:13:53.129
 the war is enough 3 that's either the most 

00:13:50.970 --> 00:13:56.670
 just once at the very beginning so that 

00:13:53.129 --> 00:13:59.100
 may be worth calling the 

00:13:56.670 --> 00:14:02.699
 grimace and three at the very beginning of 

00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:04.679
 the execution where we can do a little 

00:14:02.699 --> 00:14:07.019
 as a game we have written in the pure of 

00:14:04.679 --> 00:14:09.149
 bach jacking search code call it 

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:11.910
 after each new assignment 

00:14:09.149 --> 00:14:13.640
 of time to a variable so it's in 

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:15.260
 did what recommended the tooth 

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:17.180
 the algorithm is the pseudo conne that 

00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:17.960
 I specified in the capsules 

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.400
 former 

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:21.350
 but we could also rain at 

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:24.500
 early kingson bakker who before 

00:14:21.350 --> 00:14:27.260
 even to have done any even before 

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:29.660
 to have made a summons of a 

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:31.430
 variable value in terms of its 

00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:35.420
 complexity its complexity is going to be of in 

00:14:31.430 --> 00:14:37.700
 top of his times halls to 3 or 

00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:40.210
 stop the number of constraints and 

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:42.260
 it's the size of the domains so 

00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:44.480
 maybe a quick little explanation 

00:14:42.260 --> 00:14:48.440
 why do we get this to revise well 

00:14:44.480 --> 00:14:51.980
 his teeth high halls 2 

00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:55.580
 why because for each element 

00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:57.980
 of the variable domain etc if I have to 

00:14:55.580 --> 00:15:00.050
 do a check to know is this 

00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:04.100
 that I find a bar and a value there 

00:15:00.050 --> 00:15:06.650
 the variable grant y that allows me to 

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:08.870
 satisfy one on one for that I have 

00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:11.300
 so find a value y that is 

00:15:08.870 --> 00:15:13.760
 compatible with an x ​​value for my 

00:15:11.300 --> 00:15:17.120
 other variable and so I have to 

00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:18.530
 perish for every value of x i 

00:15:17.120 --> 00:15:19.010
 must is terrible for every value of 

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:21.680
 there 

00:15:19.010 --> 00:15:23.990
 so I have two loops on elements 

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:26.930
 so that gives me a complexity at dd at 

00:15:23.990 --> 00:15:29.930
 square provides support what must 

00:15:26.930 --> 00:15:32.330
 revise his apps by in c3 in these 

00:15:29.930 --> 00:15:38.270
 three games must alter on the arches 

00:15:32.330 --> 00:15:41.690
 we raised arch and so that's the number 

00:15:38.270 --> 00:15:43.850
 of arh that can be reinserted or 

00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:45.440
 times why at times but because 

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:50.150
 whenever a certain art is 

00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:54.650
 that we removed one or more one or more 

00:15:50.150 --> 00:15:56.930
 value of the variable of the first 

00:15:54.650 --> 00:16:00.410
 variable in my bow since 

00:15:56.930 --> 00:16:01.970
 values ​​in the domain of a variable 

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:05.810
 but I can not insert it more than high 

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:08.450
 de faith so that means that the number 

00:16:05.810 --> 00:16:12.320
 of reintegration in all these times 

00:16:08.450 --> 00:16:14.240
 opus 5 complexity oc times d and 

00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:15.440
 since the complexity of revising so 

00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.420
 it's the number of times I can 

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.670
 call revised then the complexity of 

00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:22.279
 revise cod squared I get a 

00:16:19.670 --> 00:16:24.199
 overall complexity of 

00:16:22.279 --> 00:16:27.199
 it's times oca times would have so 

00:16:24.199 --> 00:16:33.829
 cdo liver that so that's the 

00:16:27.199 --> 00:16:36.019
 complexity from 2 to 6 3 there is a 

00:16:33.829 --> 00:16:40.730
 error version in the hull father and to 

00:16:36.019 --> 00:16:42.019
 cdo square it's called ac 4 but it's 

00:16:40.730 --> 00:16:46.370
 finds that his three is on average 

00:16:42.019 --> 00:16:47.449
 more efficient so if you want more 

00:16:46.370 --> 00:16:50.120
 information I invite you to watch 

00:16:47.449 --> 00:16:51.920
 the literature on this subject there and 

00:16:50.120 --> 00:16:54.439
 I add and I would add to finish 

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:55.730
 which sense to look at my section 6.3 of 

00:16:54.439 --> 00:16:58.759
 book kings are upset that you 

00:16:55.730 --> 00:17:01.279
 go see that yo some problems of 

00:16:58.759 --> 00:17:03.649
 satisfaction of constraints or we have a 

00:17:01.279 --> 00:17:05.480
 particular structure on the 

00:17:03.649 --> 00:17:07.339
 constraints that is possible to exploit 

00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:11.150
 so some serious constraint by 

00:17:07.339 --> 00:17:13.699
 a structure 5 like a tree and that's 

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.589
 possible to exclude from exploiting the 

00:17:13.699 --> 00:17:17.059
 simplicity of the structure to have 

00:17:15.589 --> 00:17:19.669
 improvements that are sometimes 

00:17:17.059 --> 00:17:22.459
 exponential so improve the time of 

00:17:19.669 --> 00:17:23.750
 exponentially computes it for this type 

00:17:22.459 --> 00:17:25.309
 problem there is something that we 

00:17:23.750 --> 00:17:28.580
 will take a stake in the capsules here 

00:17:25.309 --> 00:17:31.580
 but you can learn more at 

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:34.419
 see section 6.5 of the book of 

00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:34.419
 return of the nordiques
