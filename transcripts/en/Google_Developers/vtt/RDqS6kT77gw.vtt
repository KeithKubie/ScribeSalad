00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:08.288
Paco has been working
on the Landing Page

00:00:08.288 --> 00:00:10.915
and thinks it's ready
to be tested on the Internet

00:00:10.915 --> 00:00:12.915
with the first version
of his application.

00:00:12.915 --> 00:00:14.816
In the first instance,
he needs to register it

00:00:14.816 --> 00:00:16.915
with Google App Engine,
which he will accomplish

00:00:16.915 --> 00:00:19.453
by following a very simple
guided procedure.

00:00:19.453 --> 00:00:22.024
Upon finishing,
he will be assigned the permits

00:00:22.024 --> 00:00:24.387
and his resources
on the platform.

00:00:24.387 --> 00:00:28.090
START NEW APPLICATION
CREATION WIZARD

00:00:29.222 --> 00:00:31.288
To start, Paco enters
appengine.google.com

00:00:31.288 --> 00:00:34.486
in his navigator,

00:00:34.486 --> 00:00:36.981
previously authorized
with his Google account,

00:00:36.981 --> 00:00:40.090
which will remain associated
as the owner of the application.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.222
For his first application,
Paco will only see the button

00:00:43.222 --> 00:00:46.453
saying "Create Application",
which he'll click on.

00:00:47.453 --> 00:00:50.915
ID AND APP NAME

00:00:52.156 --> 00:00:55.816
The next step is assigning
a unique identifier,

00:00:55.816 --> 00:00:58.024
which involves various details.

00:00:58.024 --> 00:01:00.387
It needs to coincide
with the value Paco registered

00:01:00.387 --> 00:01:03.222
in the Application field
of the app.yaml file

00:01:03.222 --> 00:01:06.255
from lesson 2,
where he made the Landing Page.

00:01:06.453 --> 00:01:09.156
As a result,
the root URL address

00:01:09.156 --> 00:01:12.387
assigned to his app
will have the following format:

00:01:12.387 --> 00:01:15.255
identificador.appspot.com.

00:01:15.255 --> 00:01:18.189
This address
is about a predetermined

00:01:18.189 --> 00:01:19.651
Google App Engine domain,

00:01:19.651 --> 00:01:22.024
and Paco will use it
to access the application,

00:01:22.024 --> 00:01:24.288
especially during
its development.

00:01:24.288 --> 00:01:26.552
Keep in mind
that this identifier

00:01:26.552 --> 00:01:29.552
needs to be available
and meet some requisites

00:01:29.552 --> 00:01:31.717
about the amount
and kind of characters,

00:01:31.717 --> 00:01:33.585
trademark, among others.

00:01:33.585 --> 00:01:37.024
The identifier
cannot be modified later.

00:01:37.024 --> 00:01:39.420
It cannot be used again either,

00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:42.057
not even after
deleting the application.

00:01:42.057 --> 00:01:44.222
This is due to that
the identifier functions

00:01:44.222 --> 00:01:47.849
as a key and remains associated
in various systems internally.

00:01:48.189 --> 00:01:50.783
The application
needs to have a name.

00:01:50.783 --> 00:01:53.453
Paco writes a short line,
concise and illustrative,

00:01:53.453 --> 00:01:55.123
with the name
of the application.

00:01:55.123 --> 00:01:57.156
This will be shown to the users,

00:01:57.156 --> 00:01:58.750
for example during verification.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.981
The name, unlike the identifier,

00:02:00.981 --> 00:02:02.882
can be changed later

00:02:02.882 --> 00:02:05.453
and is more flexible
when it comes to characters.

00:02:05.651 --> 00:02:08.717
Following the registration
application,

00:02:08.717 --> 00:02:10.519
the next field contains
the authorization options

00:02:10.519 --> 00:02:12.486
for the users
of Paco's application.

00:02:12.486 --> 00:02:14.486
The options are the following:

00:02:14.486 --> 00:02:17.156
Open to all users
with a Google account;

00:02:17.156 --> 00:02:19.189
Closed to a Google Apps domain;

00:02:19.189 --> 00:02:22.717
Open to all users
with an OpenID provider.

00:02:22.717 --> 00:02:25.090
As most users
already have a Google account,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:28.123
Paco selects the first option,

00:02:28.123 --> 00:02:30.453
Open to all Google accounts.

00:02:30.453 --> 00:02:32.816
In the next lesson,
we will take a look

00:02:32.816 --> 00:02:34.717
at the user service
where Paco will use

00:02:34.717 --> 00:02:38.156
this configuration
to control access in detail.

00:02:38.453 --> 00:02:40.519
Once the application
is finished,

00:02:40.519 --> 00:02:43.123
Paco clicks on the button
"Create Application"

00:02:43.123 --> 00:02:44.981
and will be sent
to the control board

00:02:44.981 --> 00:02:47.090
of his new application,
which is empty

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:48.387
and without data.

00:02:48.387 --> 00:02:50.585
From now on,
if Paco accesses

00:02:50.585 --> 00:02:53.552
the appengine.google.com
address again,

00:02:53.552 --> 00:02:56.387
he will see a list
with the identifier, name,

00:02:56.387 --> 00:02:59.453
storage scheme and the state
of his new application

00:02:59.453 --> 00:03:02.387
with the link to the remote
administration panel.

00:03:02.387 --> 00:03:05.321
Upon finishing this process,
the census application

00:03:05.321 --> 00:03:07.222
will have a designated address

00:03:07.222 --> 00:03:10.189
and assigned resources
for it use.

00:03:10.189 --> 00:03:13.222
Now Paco's ready
to publish his application

00:03:13.222 --> 00:03:15.420
on the Internet
with Google App Engine.

00:03:15.420 --> 00:03:17.618
Do you remember the identifier
and the authorization option

00:03:17.618 --> 00:03:19.453
selected during registration?

00:03:19.453 --> 00:03:22.618
Keep them in mind,
because you'll need them later.

00:03:22.618 --> 00:03:24.783
That's all.
Keep programming!

00:03:24.783 --> 00:03:27.948
KEEP PROGRAMMING!
