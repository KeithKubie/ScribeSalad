00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:04.340
I think you've been exposed to
the idea of a function at some

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:06.500
point in your mathematical
career.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.840
But what I want to do in this
video is explain it a little

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:11.550
bit more formerly than you might
be used to, and then

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:14.420
relate it to some of the
concepts of vectors and linear

00:00:14.420 --> 00:00:15.945
algebra that we've
seen so far.

00:00:19.585 --> 00:00:23.340
A function really is just a
relation between the members

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:25.590
of one set and the members
of the other set.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:34.070
So let's have some set x, and
for every member of that set x

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:37.740
I'm going to relate that member,
or associate that

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.075
member, with another
member of a set y.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:53.490
So if I imagine that is my set
x, and that this is my set y--

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:55.830
and y doesn't have to be
smaller, that's just the way I

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.110
drew it-- the function
is just a relation.

00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:03.290
That if I just take a member of
my set x, let's see that's

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:04.640
the member that I'm
taking, we're

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:06.640
visualizing it as a point.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.420
This function will say, OK you
gave me a member of x, then I

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:12.930
will give you a member
of y associated with

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.660
that member of x.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:18.470
So the function will say, you
give me that, then I will map

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:24.330
it to that member right there.

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.430
And that really just means
relating it to, or associating

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.200
with another member of y.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.780
And if you'd give me some other
point right here, I'll

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.000
relate it to another
member of y.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:43.240
I might even relate it to
the same member of y.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:46.220
And so this notation just says
this is a mapping from one set

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.940
x, and I'm speaking in
very general terms,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.990
to another set y.

00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:53.840
And so you're probably saying,
Hey Sal, this is very

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.260
abstract, how does this relate
to the functions that I've

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.320
seen in the past?

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.180
Well let me just write down a
function you've probably seen

00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:05.520
a lot in the past. You've
dealt with f of x

00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.330
is equal to x squared.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.520
How would we write this
in this notation?

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.260
Well this is a function,
assuming that it's kind of the

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:14.940
traditional way that
you see it.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:20.520
Let me just write with the f,
I was going to write it with

00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:22.880
the g of x, just so this doesn't
always have to be an

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.320
f, but I think you
get that idea.

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.400
In this case f is a mapping from
real numbers-- the real

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.810
numbers are everything that I
can put in here-- actually

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:35.720
this is part of the function
definition.

00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.050
I could constrain this to just
be integers, or just be even

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.160
numbers, or just be
even integers.

00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.790
But this is part of the function
definition, I'm

00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:48.000
defining the function to be a
mapping from real numbers.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.290
I'm saying you can put any real
number here, and it's

00:02:50.290 --> 00:02:56.860
going to map to real numbers.

00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:00.000
So in this case, if x is real
numbers, it's going to map to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.230
itself, which is completely
legitimate.

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:06.420
So if this is the real numbers--
and obviously the

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.660
real numbers would go off in
every direction forever-- but

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.790
if this for real numbers, this
function mapping is just

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:16.800
taking every point in
R and mapping it to

00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:17.690
another point in R.

00:03:17.690 --> 00:03:20.580
It's taking every point and
associating with it its

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:21.780
perfect square.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.240
And I want to make a very subtle
notation-- or at least

00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:26.880
in my mind the first time that
I got exposed to functions I

00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.680
was thinking, you give me an
x and I square it, and I'm

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:31.060
giving you the square of x.

00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:32.550
And that's true, you
are doing that.

00:03:32.550 --> 00:03:34.690
But at least the way my brain
worked, I kind of thought of

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:37.730
it as I was changing my
x into another number.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:39.770
And you can maybe view it that
way, and that might actually

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:41.150
be the best way to view it.

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:45.400
But the mathematical definition
I'm introducing

00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:55.190
here is more that I'm
associating x with x squared.

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:58.990
This is another function
notation of writing this exact

00:03:58.990 --> 00:03:59.630
same thing.

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:03.010
These two statements right here,
this statement and this

00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.530
statement are identical.

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:07.860
This statement you've probably
never seen before, but I like

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.160
it because it shows the mapping
or the association

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.660
more, while this association I
think that you're putting an x

00:04:16.660 --> 00:04:20.660
into a little meat grinder or
some machine that's going to

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:23.480
ground up the x or square the x,
or do whatever it needs to

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:24.410
do to the x.

00:04:24.410 --> 00:04:27.620
This notation to me implies
the actual mapping.

00:04:27.620 --> 00:04:30.070
You give me an x, and I'm going
to associate another

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:32.860
number in real numbers
called x squared.

00:04:32.860 --> 00:04:34.510
So it's going to be just
another point.

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:38.260
And just as a little bit of
terminology, and I think

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:42.910
you've seen this terminology
before, the set that you are

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.610
mapping from is called the
domain and it's part of the

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:47.660
function definition.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:51.620
I, as the function creator, have
to tell you that every

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:55.010
valid input here has to be
a set of real numbers.

00:04:55.010 --> 00:05:02.920
Now the set that I'm mapping
to is called the codomain.

00:05:08.620 --> 00:05:10.810
The obvious question that you're
probably asking is, hey

00:05:10.810 --> 00:05:15.660
Sal, when I learned all of this
function stuff in algebra

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.630
II or whenever you first learned
it, we never used this

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:19.880
codomain word.

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.100
We have this idea of range, I
learned the word range when I

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:28.840
was in 9th or 10th grade.

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:33.290
How does this codomain
relate to range?

00:05:33.290 --> 00:05:35.610
And it's a very subtle
notation.

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.670
So the codomain is a set that
you're mapping to, and in this

00:05:38.670 --> 00:05:42.035
example this is the codomain.

00:05:42.035 --> 00:05:44.390
In this example, the real
numbers are the

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:46.480
domain and the codomain.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:49.080
So the question is how does
the range relate to this?

00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.060
So the codomain is the
set that can be

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:53.640
possibly mapped to.

00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:55.530
You're not necessarily
mapping to every

00:05:55.530 --> 00:05:56.700
point in the codomain.

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.240
I'm just saying that this
function is generally mapping

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.150
from members of this
set to that set.

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:07.920
The range is the subset --
let me write it this way.

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:10.080
It could be equal
to the codomain.

00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:12.210
It's some subset.

00:06:12.210 --> 00:06:15.440
A set is a subset of itself,
every member of a set is also

00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.320
a member of itself, so it's
a subset of itself.

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:29.830
So range is a subset of the
codomain which the function

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:31.150
actually maps to.

00:06:43.585 --> 00:06:45.350
So let me give you an example.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:52.380
Let's say I define the function
g, and it is a

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:56.890
mapping from the set
of real numbers.

00:06:56.890 --> 00:07:03.450
Let me say it's a mapping
from R2 to R.

00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:06.270
So I'm essentially taking
2-tuples and I'm

00:07:06.270 --> 00:07:07.360
mapping it to R.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:11.650
And I will define g, I'll
write it a couple

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:13.670
of different ways.

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:19.170
So now I'm going to take g of
two values, I could say xy or

00:07:19.170 --> 00:07:20.380
I could say x1, x2.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:21.580
Let me do it that way.

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:32.870
g of x1, x2 is always
equal to 2.

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:38.680
It's a mapping from R2 to R,
but this always equals 2.

00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.050
And let me actually write the
other notation just because

00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:42.365
you probably haven't
seen this much.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:53.630
g maps any points x1 and
x2 to the point 2.

00:07:53.630 --> 00:07:55.670
This makes the mapping
a little bit clearer.

00:07:55.670 --> 00:07:59.183
But just to get the notation
right, what is our domain?

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.600
What's the real number?

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:05.760
That was part of my function
definition, I said we're

00:08:05.760 --> 00:08:09.980
mapping from R2, so
my domain is R2.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:14.760
Now what is my codomain?

00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:23.230
My codomain is the set that I'm
potentially mapping to,

00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:25.480
and is part of the function
definition.

00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:27.750
This by definition
is the codomain.

00:08:27.750 --> 00:08:30.030
So my codomain is R.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:33.190
Now what is the range
of my function?

00:08:36.390 --> 00:08:40.159
The range is the set of values
that the function

00:08:40.159 --> 00:08:41.770
actually maps to.

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:45.710
In this case, we always map to
the value 2, so the range is

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:47.480
actually just the value 2.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.650
And if we were to visualize
this-- R2 is actually-- I

00:08:50.650 --> 00:08:53.300
wouldn't draw it as a blurb, I
would draw it as the entire

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:57.130
Cartesian space, but I'm just
giving you an abstract notion.

00:08:57.130 --> 00:08:57.950
That's R2.

00:08:57.950 --> 00:09:00.270
If I really have to draw R, I'd
draw it as some type of a

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:01.840
number line.

00:09:01.840 --> 00:09:03.740
Actually let me do it that way
just for fun, you don't

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:05.260
normally see it written
that way.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.220
But I could just draw R like
that's R2, and I could just

00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:11.620
draw R as some straight line.

00:09:11.620 --> 00:09:14.350
So this is the set R.

00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:16.150
I could draw it like that
as well, but let's just

00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:17.270
say this is set R.

00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:23.780
And my function g essentially
maps any point over here to

00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.080
exactly the point 2.

00:09:27.080 --> 00:09:29.050
2 is just one little
point in R.

00:09:29.050 --> 00:09:36.200
My function g takes any point in
R2, any coordinate, this is

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.630
the point 3, minus 5,
whatever it is.

00:09:40.630 --> 00:09:43.080
It always maps it to
the point 2 in R.

00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:45.830
So if I think that point it
maps it to the point 2.

00:09:45.830 --> 00:09:48.720
That's what g always does.

00:09:48.720 --> 00:09:52.980
So g's codomain-- you could
say it's all of the real

00:09:52.980 --> 00:09:55.205
numbers, but it's range
is really just 2.

00:10:00.040 --> 00:10:02.690
Let me do another example that
might be interesting.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:12.920
If I just write h is a function
that goes from R2 to

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:18.610
R3, and I'll be a little
careful here, h

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:20.480
goes from R2 to R3.

00:10:20.480 --> 00:10:30.385
And I'll write here that h of
x1, x2 is equal to -- so now

00:10:30.385 --> 00:10:33.140
I'm mapping a higher dimension
space, so I'm going to say

00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:37.070
that that is going to be equal
to, let's say my first

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:43.400
coordinate or my first component
at R3 is x1 plus x2.

00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:47.440
Let's say my second coordinate
is x2 minus x1.

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:52.550
And let's say my third
coordinate is x2 times x1.

00:10:52.550 --> 00:11:00.150
Now what is my domain and my
range and my codomain?

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.140
So my domain by definition
is this right there.

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:08.230
My codomain by definition
is R3.

00:11:08.230 --> 00:11:11.870
And notice I'm going from a
space that has two dimensions

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:14.080
to a space it has three
dimensions, or three

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:14.590
components.

00:11:14.590 --> 00:11:18.070
But I can always associate some
point with x1, x2 with

00:11:18.070 --> 00:11:20.840
some point in my R3 there.

00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:25.840
A slightly trickier question
here is, what is the range?

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:30.410
Can I always associate every
point-- maybe this wasn't the

00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:32.940
best example because it's not
simple enough -- but can I

00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:42.190
associate every point in R3--
so this is my codomain, my

00:11:42.190 --> 00:11:47.870
domain was R2, and my function
goes from R2 to

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.690
R3, so that's h.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.410
And so my range, as you could
see, it's not like every

00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:59.710
coordinate you can express
in this way in some way.

00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:00.960
Let me give you an example.

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:07.110
I could put some x1's and x2's
here and figure it out.

00:12:07.110 --> 00:12:07.660
Let's do that.

00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:15.120
Let's take our h of-- let me use
my other notation-- let's

00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:19.070
say that I said h, and I wanted
to find the mapping

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:25.130
from the point in R2, let's
say the point 2 comma 3.

00:12:25.130 --> 00:12:28.780
And then my function tells me
that this will map to the

00:12:28.780 --> 00:12:31.880
point in R3.

00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.450
I add the two terms, the
2 plus 3, so it's 5.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:39.100
I'd find the difference between
x2 and x1-- so 3 minus

00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:43.150
2 is 1-- and then I multiply
the two, 6.

00:12:43.150 --> 00:12:46.370
So clearly this will be in
the range, this is a

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:48.250
member of the range.

00:12:54.350 --> 00:12:59.330
So for example the point 2, 3,
which might be right there,

00:12:59.330 --> 00:13:02.180
will be mapped to the three
dimensional point, it's kind

00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.520
of just drawn as a two
dimensional blurb right there,

00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.050
but I think you get the idea,
would be mapped to the three

00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:09.670
dimensional point 5, 1, 6.

00:13:09.670 --> 00:13:12.860
So this is definitely a
member of the range.

00:13:12.860 --> 00:13:22.260
Now my question to you, if I
have some point in R3, let's

00:13:22.260 --> 00:13:33.050
say that this is the
point 5, 1, 0.

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:36.200
Is this point a member
of the range?

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.790
It's definitely a member of
the codomain, it's in R3.

00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:40.110
It's definitely in
here, and this by

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:41.900
definition is the codomain.

00:13:41.900 --> 00:13:43.910
But is this in our range?

00:13:46.770 --> 00:13:50.570
5 has to be the sum of two
numbers, the 1 has to be the

00:13:50.570 --> 00:13:53.270
difference of two numbers, and
then the 0 would have to be

00:13:53.270 --> 00:13:55.350
the product of two numbers.

00:13:55.350 --> 00:13:57.790
And clearly we know 5 is the
sum, and 1 is the difference,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.240
we're dealing with 2 and 3, and
there's no way you can get

00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.750
the product of those numbers
to be equal to 0.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:08.520
So this guy is not
in the range.

00:14:08.520 --> 00:14:11.210
So the range would be the subset
of all of these points

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.660
in R3, so there'd be a ton of
points that aren't in the

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:17.250
range, and there'll be a smaller
subset of R3 that is

00:14:17.250 --> 00:14:18.140
in the range.

00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.970
Now I want to introduce you to
one more piece of terminology

00:14:22.970 --> 00:14:24.870
when it comes to functions.

00:14:24.870 --> 00:14:28.760
These functions up here, this
function that mapped from

00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.690
points in R2 to R, so
its codomain was R.

00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:36.390
This function up here is
probably the most common

00:14:36.390 --> 00:14:38.940
function you see in mathematics,
this is also

00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:40.980
mapping to R.

00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:44.560
These functions that map to R
are called scalar value or

00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:47.300
real value, depending on how
you want to think about it.

00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:51.230
But if they map to a one
dimensional space, we call

00:14:51.230 --> 00:14:54.290
them a scalar valued function,
or a real valued function.

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:05.000
Which is pretty much all of
the functions that you've

00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.270
probably dealt with up to this
point in your mathematical

00:15:08.270 --> 00:15:11.750
career, unless you've taken
some vector calculus.

00:15:11.750 --> 00:15:19.940
Now the functions that map to
spaces or subspaces that have

00:15:19.940 --> 00:15:23.440
more than one dimension-- so if
you map to R or any subset

00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.850
of R, you have a real valued
function, or a

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:27.190
scalar valued function.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:32.480
If you map to Rn, where n is
greater than 1, so if you map

00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:37.670
to R2, R3, R4, R100, you're
then dealing with a vector

00:15:37.670 --> 00:15:38.620
valued function.

00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:43.340
So this last function that I
defined over here, h is a

00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:50.270
vector valued function.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.260
Anyway I think you now have
at least the mathematical

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.870
notational tools to understand
what I'm going to do in the

00:15:56.870 --> 00:15:59.640
rest of this playlist, and
hopefully you found this

00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.740
reasonably useful.
