00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.990
&gt;&gt; 
So, introduce your company.

00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:11.475
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Okay.
&gt;&gt; And a brief overview of the application.

00:00:11.475 --> 00:00:15.110
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Okay. My name is David White. I'm
with FlightStats. We’re a data company.

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:21.119
We track about 150,000 airline flights a day
and report out on their status. We supervise

00:00:21.119 --> 00:00:28.590
airport delay information, weather and airline
information. We also supply data to Google.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:35.120
If you, if you type a flight number into the
Google Onebox or text the flight number to

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:41.370
Google SMS, you’ll get our data back and
response. We got enthusiastic about the Android

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:46.810
platform after supplying data to mobile developers
and some of the other popular platforms, and

00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:56.310
decided that we were doing our app for Android.
It was an interesting platform play for us.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:01:02.170
We were enthusiastic about the growth potential
and the growth potential worldwide as we supply

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:09.900
data for global flights. The development went
pretty well, surprisingly, quickly. The environment

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.570
was very similar to Java environment that
we develop our own apps in, and things went

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:22.380
pretty well.
&gt;&gt; So, can you tell us a little bit behind

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:27.140
your decision on the Android platform?
&gt;&gt; WHITE: As I mentioned, the development

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:33.940
environment looked friendly to us and familiar.
It was a good business decision we think,

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:40.880
even know the volume of sales on the Android
phones is low to date. We expect them really

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.530
tremendous growth in some key markets for
us. So, the technical decision was pretty

00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:52.680
easy. The business decision seemed a little
risky, given the early state of the Android

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.070
platform. But given the announcements at the
I/O about the number of phones going out this

00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.680
year, we’re pretty certain we made the right
decision.

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:08.280
&gt;&gt; Had there been any technical challenges
that you tried to deal with?

00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.850
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Nothing really major. I think most
of the decisions we had to make were really

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:18.240
about user experience and understanding what
was possible with the Android platform and

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:24.110
the tools that were provided. Some of the
challenges I think we'll be facing ahead have

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:31.880
to do with interoperability with other apps
and the [INDISTINCT] and things like that.

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:37.180
&gt;&gt; Are there any new features in Cupcake that
you’ve been able take advantage of?

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:41.930
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Yeah, we have a version we haven’t
made available yet because the T-Mobile Cupcake

00:02:41.930 --> 00:02:47.010
update, I guess, is not quite done yet. But
we were able to implement a widget for our

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:54.340
flight status application. So, it display
your safe flights on you home screen, and

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:59.250
with one touch you can update the status on
all your safe lights and quickly see how you’re

00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:08.780
doing, whether your flights on time or delayed.
&gt;&gt; Are there any tips or tricks that you’ve

00:03:08.780 --> 00:03:12.190
been able to do on the Android platform that
you haven’t able to do on other platforms?

00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:18.220
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Well, the widget was actually a
lot easier to implement than we thought. Google

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.879
encouraged to us to do that to help them to
show off the widget capability and the platform,

00:03:23.879 --> 00:03:28.879
and it turned out to be a pretty simple thing,
and we’re hoping that the users will really

00:03:28.879 --> 00:03:38.459
like it and take advantage of that.
&gt;&gt; What’s your favorite aspect of the Android

00:03:38.459 --> 00:03:41.760
platform?
&gt;&gt; WHITE: One thing that’s really appealing

00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:47.349
beyond the widget thing is that you can keep
multiple apps open on your phone. That’s

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:53.950
the limitation I run into as an iPhone user.
Android get your past and so we’re looking

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:01.330
forward to interoperability with other travel
apps, applications that might help guide you

00:04:01.330 --> 00:04:06.659
through other parts of your trip, might access
flight data and flight status from FlightStats

00:04:06.659 --> 00:04:12.950
for Android and present it to you through
their apps. So we’re looking forward to

00:04:12.950 --> 00:04:19.680
that, definitely.
&gt;&gt; All right. And other features in your apps

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:24.509
that's developed on top of Android that do
not exist on other platform?

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:31.340
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Well, so far, just the widget I
think. Otherwise, you’ll be seeing features

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:37.090
that you may have seen on iPhone travel apps
that use our data, but we’re definitely

00:04:37.090 --> 00:04:40.819
exploring the platform and looking for us
from other opportunities to really kind of

00:04:40.819 --> 00:04:47.119
plumb the depths of the Android platform.
&gt;&gt; Well, I want to thank you for time today.

00:04:47.119 --> 00:04:47.809
&gt;&gt; WHITE: Okay. Thank you.
&gt;&gt; Great show.
