&gt;&gt; Good morning!

00:04:16.396 --> 00:04:21.586
We are gathered this
morning in a wonderfully free

00:04:22.486 --> 00:04:26.436
and collaborative place of
study of work and living.

00:04:26.956 --> 00:04:33.146
We are diverse in our
field of study, our talents

and abilities, our ethnicities

00:04:36.686 --> 00:04:39.886
and the places that
we call home.

00:04:39.886 --> 00:04:43.336
In light of a respect for others
and with the acknowledgment

00:04:43.336 --> 00:04:47.226

to join me if you are able

00:04:47.796 --> 00:04:55.836

and the class of 2016.

00:04:55.936 --> 00:05:01.556
All mighty God, we gather today

University Class of 2016.

00:05:08.266 --> 00:05:11.416
We pause for a moment

through continual innovation
and education research,

00:06:06.856 --> 00:06:08.576
creativity and entrepreneurship.

00:06:11.886 --> 00:06:18.136
Continue to teach these
students and us as well to look

00:06:18.136 --> 00:06:22.016
with compassion on
others both near and far.

00:06:23.476 --> 00:06:27.716
Take away any arrogance or
hatred that may influence us.

00:06:29.296 --> 00:06:32.846
And give us grace and the
ability to love our neighbors

00:06:33.946 --> 00:06:36.106

all areas of life.

Bless these students as
they enter the next stages

00:06:41.556 --> 00:06:44.546
of their lives and seek to
reach their full potential.

00:06:45.806 --> 00:06:49.216
Be with them as they take steps
in the known and to the unknown.

00:06:50.336 --> 00:06:53.886
May all that they
do and the decisions

00:06:53.886 --> 00:06:55.986

00:06:56.706 --> 00:06:58.176

We send them forth to impact
society in transformative ways

00:07:04.446 --> 00:07:06.556
through their work, their
lives, and their partnerships.

00:07:08.126 --> 00:07:12.846
Bless also the rest of the
world that we may learn to love.

00:07:40.986 --> 00:07:45.186
Ladies and gentlemen,
OK you might

00:07:45.186 --> 00:07:46.626
as well sit down and relax.

00:07:48.406 --> 00:07:53.216
In behalf of the Board of
Trustees let me welcome you

00:07:53.346 --> 00:07:57.416
to the 119th commencement of
the Carnegie Mellon University.

00:07:58.706 --> 00:08:01.486
My name is Jim Rohr it's my
honored and pleasure to serve

00:08:01.486 --> 00:08:03.786
as the Carnegie Mellon
Board of Chairman Trustee--

00:08:03.786 --> 00:08:05.886
Chairman of the Carnegie
Mellon Board of Trustees

00:08:06.366 --> 00:08:08.086
and address you briefly to today

00:08:08.086 --> 00:08:10.366
in my first experience
as the chair.

00:08:10.366 --> 00:08:14.526
To all the students
graduating today, let me begin

00:08:14.526 --> 00:08:16.356
by congratulating you
and your achievement.

00:08:16.476 --> 00:08:20.456
This degree obviously
represents years of hard work

00:08:20.456 --> 00:08:22.886
and self discipline,
of discovery

00:08:22.886 --> 00:08:25.106
and different problem solving.

00:08:26.086 --> 00:08:29.426
There's no question that today
the Carnegie Mellon University

00:08:29.426 --> 00:08:33.526
degree is more important
and more representative

00:08:33.706 --> 00:08:39.156
and more inspiring than it
ever has been in the past.

00:08:39.216 --> 00:08:40.376
The combination of the arts

00:08:40.376 --> 00:08:43.096
and science is coming
together the way they are

00:08:43.096 --> 00:08:46.486
around the world is
recognize here on this campus.

00:08:47.596 --> 00:08:49.366
And also it's recognized

00:08:49.366 --> 00:08:51.436
that you have surpassed
the highest standard

00:08:51.436 --> 00:08:53.926
of accomplishment in
science, art and ideas

00:08:54.506 --> 00:08:56.716
and that you're ready to
use all of that knowledge

00:08:57.146 --> 00:08:58.216
for the rest of your lives.

00:08:59.036 --> 00:09:01.466
Congratulations to you
all, if we can have a round

00:09:01.466 --> 00:09:02.606
of applause for the graduates.

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:09.746
[ Applause ]

00:09:10.246 --> 00:09:12.316
Just o n a quick
personal note in addition

00:09:12.316 --> 00:09:16.976
to my own congratulations, a
few items about Carnegie Mellon,

00:09:16.976 --> 00:09:20.526
one is its known for hard
work and if you think

00:09:20.526 --> 00:09:23.706
about success there is no
success without hard work.

00:09:23.706 --> 00:09:27.446
I'm going to give you a
prediction today I have a 95%

00:09:27.476 --> 00:09:32.996
confidence level that each
of you will be successful

00:09:33.866 --> 00:09:35.036
and I really do believe that.

00:09:36.576 --> 00:09:40.066
But to the extent as to how
success you are, one there has

00:09:40.066 --> 00:09:43.296
to be some good fortune but
there is to be hard work,

00:09:43.876 --> 00:09:45.186
there's no question about that.

00:09:46.406 --> 00:09:50.116
There's has to be collaboration
because in teamwork,

00:09:50.116 --> 00:09:53.836
teams over the long run
defeat the individuals they're

00:09:53.836 --> 00:09:54.676
more successful.

00:09:54.676 --> 00:09:57.796
So teamwork is critically
important in the collaboration

00:09:57.796 --> 00:09:59.176
that you've learned
here on the campus

00:09:59.176 --> 00:10:02.306
at Carnegie Mellon will serve
you extraordinarily well,

00:10:02.796 --> 00:10:04.336
extraordinarily well
into the future.

00:10:05.566 --> 00:10:08.546
Thirdly values, there's
no question

00:10:08.546 --> 00:10:11.456
that if you live you values
you well be more successful

00:10:11.456 --> 00:10:12.236
in the long run.

00:10:13.046 --> 00:10:15.276
Stop and ask your
self from time to time

00:10:15.276 --> 00:10:18.556
if you're doing the right thing
a simple question like that.

00:10:19.426 --> 00:10:23.656
Don't forget integrity, don't
forget to respect others,

00:10:24.326 --> 00:10:26.896
you can't be a good teammate
if you have no integrity

00:10:27.646 --> 00:10:30.446
and you can't be a good teammate
if you don't respect the others.

00:10:31.406 --> 00:10:36.106
My last point would be
humility, it takes humility

00:10:36.106 --> 00:10:38.126
to be a good teammate
and remember

00:10:38.126 --> 00:10:40.716
that arrogance kills,
arrogance kills.

00:10:42.586 --> 00:10:48.406
What you think about
humility, none of you got

00:10:48.406 --> 00:10:51.836
to this graduation
point by yourselves all

00:10:51.836 --> 00:10:56.636
of you have friends, family
members, mentors, faculty,

00:10:56.936 --> 00:10:59.796
staff who take great pride in
what you've accomplish today.

00:11:00.496 --> 00:11:05.606
And it takes quite a team effort
to be able to achieve a diploma

00:11:05.606 --> 00:11:07.196
from an institutional
of this quality.

00:11:08.256 --> 00:11:10.756
You couldn't have done it
without them, so right now I'd

00:11:10.756 --> 00:11:13.756
like you to join me in thanking
those people who have led you

00:11:13.756 --> 00:11:16.666
and helped you to achieve
this wonderful accomplishment.

00:11:17.516 --> 00:11:24.646
[ Applause ]

00:11:25.146 --> 00:11:29.856
Now, with us today at our 119th
commencement are some faculty

00:11:29.856 --> 00:11:32.816
and students from Carnegie
Mellon other locations

00:11:32.816 --> 00:11:33.536
around the world.

00:11:34.256 --> 00:11:37.346
We're delighted to have
them here today as graduates

00:11:37.346 --> 00:11:39.656
of Carnegie Mellon
they are ambassadors

00:11:39.656 --> 00:11:40.966
of a distinctive university.

00:11:41.566 --> 00:11:44.996
It was here that all of
them gained solid grounding

00:11:44.996 --> 00:11:47.406
in their field of major
studies as all of you have.

00:11:47.876 --> 00:11:49.886
It was here that you
learned how to collaborate

00:11:49.936 --> 00:11:52.716
with people whose
backgrounds were very different

00:11:52.716 --> 00:11:53.246
from your own.

00:11:53.746 --> 00:11:55.906
And it was here that
you discover new ideas

00:11:56.336 --> 00:11:58.736
about the world and
aspects of your self.

00:11:59.296 --> 00:12:01.876
So with those of you around the
world that are joining us today,

00:12:02.296 --> 00:12:05.876
thank you for being here and
for those who are graduating,

00:12:05.976 --> 00:12:08.066
congratulations to you.

00:12:09.516 --> 00:12:12.636
Now, another group that's
here is the board of trustees.

00:12:12.886 --> 00:12:15.776
It's their job to uphold
the value of the university,

00:12:15.776 --> 00:12:19.566
to work with the administration,
to develop the aspirations

00:12:19.636 --> 00:12:21.576
for the university
and to make sure

00:12:21.576 --> 00:12:24.206
that there's a strategic
plan that it's being executed

00:12:24.206 --> 00:12:26.576
in order to fulfill
those aspirations.

00:12:27.446 --> 00:12:29.136
We have a number of
those trustees here

00:12:29.136 --> 00:12:30.386
in the platform this morning.

00:12:30.386 --> 00:12:31.446
I would like them, please

00:12:31.446 --> 00:12:33.376
if they could stand
and be recognized.

00:12:34.516 --> 00:12:43.456
[ Applause ]

00:12:43.956 --> 00:12:44.456
Thank you.

00:12:45.456 --> 00:12:47.796
Well this year, Carnegie
Mellon has added

00:12:47.836 --> 00:12:51.636
to its remarkable momentum to
the number of new initiatives

00:12:51.636 --> 00:12:54.636
and partnerships that are
contributing to its growth

00:12:54.636 --> 00:12:56.496
of knowledge, a growth of
knowledge in the world.

00:12:56.496 --> 00:12:59.396
We're moving forward
rapidly with distinctive

00:12:59.396 --> 00:13:03.286
and collaborative education,
ambitious research programs

00:13:03.286 --> 00:13:05.876
in areas ranging from
energy, data science,

00:13:06.316 --> 00:13:08.956
workings of the brain and
even the science of learning.

00:13:10.016 --> 00:13:14.076
A campus footprint is growing
with plans fully under way

00:13:14.496 --> 00:13:16.476
for spectacular new
spaces design

00:13:16.476 --> 00:13:18.676
to make CMU a standard center

00:13:18.676 --> 00:13:22.296
for the 21st century higher
education with emphasis

00:13:22.296 --> 00:13:25.596
on collaboration across
fields of expertise,

00:13:26.156 --> 00:13:28.256
creative problem
solving and innovation.

00:13:29.136 --> 00:13:30.466
Behind all of these growth

00:13:30.466 --> 00:13:32.816
and expansion is our
dynamic president

00:13:33.606 --> 00:13:36.266
who joined the university
in 2013

00:13:36.266 --> 00:13:37.976
from the National
Science Foundation

00:13:38.466 --> 00:13:40.756
and who is already had
a tremendous effect

00:13:40.906 --> 00:13:41.666
on the institution.

00:13:41.666 --> 00:13:45.556
It's my great privilege now to
introduce the ninth president

00:13:45.556 --> 00:13:48.386
of Carnegie Mellon
University Dr. Subra Suresh.

00:13:49.516 --> 00:13:56.816
[ Applause ]

00:13:57.316 --> 00:14:00.456
&gt;&gt; Thank you Jim,
good morning everyone.

00:14:02.526 --> 00:14:05.806
Congratulations to
all the graduates.

00:14:07.566 --> 00:14:11.086
Commencement is always a
very special day not just

00:14:11.086 --> 00:14:13.446
for the graduates, not just

00:14:13.446 --> 00:14:16.776
for the Carnegie Mellon
University community but also

00:14:16.776 --> 00:14:20.466
for family, friends,
faculty and staff.

00:14:21.836 --> 00:14:26.336
But more than anything else
it's a milestone for you

00:14:27.296 --> 00:14:29.046
to celebrate your
accomplishments.

00:14:30.366 --> 00:14:34.196
You worked very hard to get
here and you are all here--

00:14:34.256 --> 00:14:36.306
we all here to salute you.

00:14:38.046 --> 00:14:42.006
As you may know it's a
Carnegie Mellon tradition

00:14:42.786 --> 00:14:47.096
to entrust the conditions of
the weather for the commencement

00:14:47.096 --> 00:14:48.826
with the provost
of the university.

00:14:50.996 --> 00:14:55.096
And this academic year
we further expanded

00:14:55.096 --> 00:15:00.986
that responsibility for the
provost by unofficial resolution

00:15:00.986 --> 00:15:04.296
by the faculty senate that if
the provost doesn't deliver

00:15:04.296 --> 00:15:07.386
on the weather, we have the
right to dunk the provost.

00:15:08.516 --> 00:15:13.426
Of course, a small incentive
goes a long way as you can see.

00:15:13.686 --> 00:15:18.706
Let me start by expressing
my sincere appreciation

00:15:19.836 --> 00:15:22.506
to our Chair of the Board
of Trustees, Jim Rohr,

00:15:23.466 --> 00:15:26.696
for being an excellent
partner as Chairman

00:15:26.696 --> 00:15:28.946
of the Carnegie Mellon
University Board of Trustees.

00:15:30.266 --> 00:15:35.636
In a short time, just
starting July 1 of last year,

00:15:36.426 --> 00:15:38.946
Jim has brought the vision,
leadership and energy

00:15:38.946 --> 00:15:42.726
to Carnegie Mellon
that made him one

00:15:42.726 --> 00:15:47.976
of nation's greatest businessman
and a household name in the city

00:15:47.976 --> 00:15:49.186
of Pittsburgh and the region.

00:15:50.486 --> 00:15:53.256
This has helped the university
make immediate improvements

00:15:53.886 --> 00:15:56.726
while also laying a great
foundation for the future.

00:15:58.136 --> 00:16:02.196
On a personal note, it's been
my enormous honor and privilege

00:16:02.256 --> 00:16:06.266
to have the opportunity to serve
this great institution along

00:16:06.266 --> 00:16:07.036
with Jim Rohr.

00:16:08.736 --> 00:16:12.616
I would also like to recognize
three long serving dedicated

00:16:12.616 --> 00:16:17.286
leaders of Carnegie
Mellon, Michael Murphy,

00:16:18.426 --> 00:16:21.226
Cheryl Hays and Fred Gilman.

00:16:23.066 --> 00:16:29.576
Michael, who came to Carnegie
Mellon in 1982 is stepping

00:16:29.576 --> 00:16:31.956
down as vice president
for Campus Affairs

00:16:33.026 --> 00:16:36.286
but will remain affiliated
with teaching

00:16:36.286 --> 00:16:39.196
and education in
the Heinz College.

00:16:40.736 --> 00:16:43.316
Over a remarkable
quarter of century or more

00:16:43.316 --> 00:16:48.926
in senior leadership, Michael
Murphy has served as dean

00:16:48.926 --> 00:16:53.206
of students and for the last
seven years as vice president.

00:16:54.556 --> 00:16:59.266
He has brought dedication,
compassion, and deep integrity

00:16:59.976 --> 00:17:03.616
to all that he has done and
that legacy will benefit the

00:17:03.616 --> 00:17:05.906
university for years to come.

00:17:07.356 --> 00:17:11.896
He's also been a great
counselor and a friend to me.

00:17:13.026 --> 00:17:13.796
Thank you, Michael.

00:17:14.516 --> 00:17:22.396
[ Applause ]

00:17:22.896 --> 00:17:26.706
After 16 years of tireless
service to Carnegie Mellon,

00:17:28.096 --> 00:17:32.366
Cheryl Hays will step away from
her valued role as secretary

00:17:32.366 --> 00:17:36.186
to the board of the trustees
and as senior adviser

00:17:36.186 --> 00:17:39.816
to the president and will
retire at the end of June,

00:17:40.566 --> 00:17:41.416
the end of next month.

00:17:42.876 --> 00:17:45.416
Cheryl has been a huge
asset to Carnegie Mellon,

00:17:46.306 --> 00:17:49.136
helping to lead several
governance reviews of the board

00:17:49.996 --> 00:17:52.496
and streamlining and enhancing
the work of the board.

00:17:53.726 --> 00:17:58.096
She played an important role in
the preparation for and approval

00:17:58.296 --> 00:18:03.916
of CMU Qatar Campus more than 12
years ago, as well as the design

00:18:03.916 --> 00:18:05.956
and construction of
the Posner Center,

00:18:06.626 --> 00:18:09.156
the board's full--
first full-time home.

00:18:10.626 --> 00:18:14.756
On a personal note,
Cheryl played a key role

00:18:15.996 --> 00:18:19.216
in the presidential search
process that brought me

00:18:19.216 --> 00:18:24.356
to Carnegie Mellon University
and in helping me and my wife,

00:18:24.356 --> 00:18:27.976
Mary, to transition to
Carnegie Mellon University

00:18:27.976 --> 00:18:31.206
and to Pittsburgh from
Washington D.C. and Boston.

00:18:32.436 --> 00:18:35.456
Carnegie Mellon will miss
her care for the board

00:18:35.456 --> 00:18:37.996
and love for the university.

00:18:38.996 --> 00:18:39.946
Thank you, Cheryl.

00:18:40.516 --> 00:18:47.596
[ Applause ]

00:18:48.096 --> 00:18:51.446
And Fred Gilman, Dean
of the Mellon College

00:18:51.446 --> 00:18:54.276
of Science is stepping
down from the position

00:18:54.276 --> 00:18:57.316
which he has held since 2007.

00:18:58.566 --> 00:19:03.806
Fred has led the MCS faculty
in a comprehensive rethinking

00:19:03.806 --> 00:19:05.806
of undergraduate
science education,

00:19:06.676 --> 00:19:08.776
building on the college's
strong history

00:19:08.776 --> 00:19:12.276
of research and education.

00:19:12.276 --> 00:19:18.566
Once a successor is named very,
very soon, Fred will refocus

00:19:19.156 --> 00:19:22.436
on his research into
high energy theory

00:19:22.716 --> 00:19:24.766
on his education
responsibilities

00:19:24.766 --> 00:19:27.446
as the Buhl Professor
of Theoretical Physics.

00:19:28.616 --> 00:19:30.876
But always the Mellon
College proponent,

00:19:31.836 --> 00:19:36.196
he plans to continue helping the
college secure external support

00:19:36.196 --> 00:19:39.016
and, of course, internal
support.

00:19:39.566 --> 00:19:42.426
Fred has been a great
champion of the college

00:19:43.196 --> 00:19:44.616
and pillar of Carnegie Mellon.

00:19:46.136 --> 00:19:47.656
Thank you very much,
Fred Gilman.

00:19:48.516 --> 00:19:55.796
[ Applause ]

00:19:56.296 --> 00:19:59.136
I would now like to recognize
a number of alumni groups

00:19:59.136 --> 00:19:59.976
that are in attendance today.

00:20:01.406 --> 00:20:04.586
Not those of you who are about
to become alumni but those

00:20:04.586 --> 00:20:05.926
who are already alumni.

00:20:07.176 --> 00:20:15.966
The 2016 Alumni Award Honorees,
would you please stand first.

00:20:16.516 --> 00:20:24.176
[ Applause ]

00:20:24.676 --> 00:20:29.976
The Class of 1966 50th reunion
celebrants, please stand.

00:20:30.516 --> 00:20:41.726
[ Applause ]

00:20:42.226 --> 00:20:46.506
As you know, Carnegie Tech
became Carnegie Mellon in 1967,

00:20:46.746 --> 00:20:48.826
so it's a very special
reunion class.

00:20:50.226 --> 00:20:54.956
CMU volunteer leaders, who
welcomed the graduates and serve

00:20:54.956 --> 00:20:58.186
as alumni marshals for the
colleges, will you please stand.

00:20:59.596 --> 00:21:01.526
We know you are here
working very hard.

00:21:02.516 --> 00:21:07.516
[ Applause ]

00:21:08.016 --> 00:21:10.116
And of course, our
legacy families,

00:21:11.006 --> 00:21:14.446
we want to recognize
you as well.

00:21:14.646 --> 00:21:19.066
Carnegie Mellon is a beloved
tradition in so many families

00:21:19.066 --> 00:21:22.196
and we are always pleased to
see successive generations

00:21:22.196 --> 00:21:24.336
of family members
attending Carnegie Mellon.

00:21:25.426 --> 00:21:28.906
All CMU alumni here today
are specially designated

00:21:28.906 --> 00:21:32.266
by the blue stalls
they are wearing.

00:21:32.266 --> 00:21:36.196
We are happy to see so
many of you back home here.

00:21:36.456 --> 00:21:40.536
Would all CMU alumni in
attendance, please stand

00:21:40.536 --> 00:21:41.786
and be recognized now.

00:21:42.516 --> 00:21:54.696
[ Applause ]

00:21:55.196 --> 00:21:57.206
It's wonderful to have you here

00:21:57.206 --> 00:22:00.946
and I hope I our new graduates
today continue this tradition

00:22:00.946 --> 00:22:03.286
and return to commencement
in the future.

00:22:03.776 --> 00:22:09.156
One alumna, who was
certainly keen on returning

00:22:09.156 --> 00:22:13.576
to Carnegie Mellon is your
new Alumni Association Board

00:22:13.576 --> 00:22:19.346
President, Debbie Yu,
Dietrich College Class of 1989.

00:22:20.826 --> 00:22:25.046
Debbie joined the Alumni
Association Board in 2010,

00:22:25.496 --> 00:22:28.206
now co-chairs its
nominating committee

00:22:28.676 --> 00:22:31.706
and will begin her active
term as president in July.

00:22:33.056 --> 00:22:35.076
While she was earning
her bachelor's degree

00:22:35.076 --> 00:22:39.286
in technical writing at Carnegie
Mellon, she was a reporter

00:22:39.286 --> 00:22:42.466
for the "Tartan" and
was active in her pre--

00:22:42.466 --> 00:22:44.236
in the Pre-Law Society.

00:22:45.236 --> 00:22:49.026
Now a partner at the firm of
Gallagher Sharp in Cleveland,

00:22:49.716 --> 00:22:53.246
Ohio, Debbie has been
an active volunteer

00:22:53.246 --> 00:22:58.086
for the Northeast Ohio Alumni
network since 2007 having

00:22:58.086 --> 00:23:01.446
so previously as
network president.

00:23:01.896 --> 00:23:03.246
She also volunteers

00:23:03.246 --> 00:23:06.816
as a Carnegie Mellon admission
interviewer and is active

00:23:06.816 --> 00:23:09.826
in a number of professional
and community organizations.

00:23:10.906 --> 00:23:14.226
I'm sure she will be
a great representative

00:23:14.226 --> 00:23:16.526
for all of CMU alumni.

00:23:17.366 --> 00:23:19.886
I very much look forward
to working with Debbie

00:23:19.886 --> 00:23:21.016
in the next few years.

00:23:21.676 --> 00:23:24.686
Now, I would like to
invite her to the podium.

00:23:25.516 --> 00:23:31.236
[ Applause ]

00:23:31.736 --> 00:23:32.966
&gt;&gt; Thank you President Suresh.

00:23:33.776 --> 00:23:37.316
It is my honor to be here
today representing the Alumni

00:23:37.316 --> 00:23:42.586
Association in congratulating
you, the future community

00:23:42.586 --> 00:23:45.766
and industry leaders,
entrepreneurs,

00:23:45.866 --> 00:23:50.596
industry representatives,
engineers, writers,

00:23:50.796 --> 00:23:51.816
artists and the list goes on.

00:23:51.816 --> 00:23:53.796
More than feeling honored
though, I am excited.

00:23:54.236 --> 00:23:58.176
I'm of course excited for you
in reaching this milestone.

00:23:58.176 --> 00:24:01.596
I remember all too well the
hard work that it takes to get

00:24:01.596 --> 00:24:03.646
to this point and commend you.

00:24:04.626 --> 00:24:07.206
I am however, excited
for another reason,

00:24:07.476 --> 00:24:10.416
very soon you'll discover the
true strength of your education

00:24:10.416 --> 00:24:14.386
that you received here at
Carnegie Mellon and the power

00:24:14.386 --> 00:24:16.376
of being a Carnegie
Mellon alumni.

00:24:17.976 --> 00:24:20.556
Very soon you'll see
that the perseverance

00:24:20.556 --> 00:24:22.256
and intellectual curiosity

00:24:22.476 --> 00:24:26.956
that helped make you reached
this point will serve you well

00:24:26.956 --> 00:24:29.836
as you enter the next
phase of your career.

00:24:30.146 --> 00:24:34.856
As a Carnegie Mellon alumni,
doors will open for you

00:24:35.146 --> 00:24:36.676
and also you'll have
opportunities

00:24:36.676 --> 00:24:39.176
to grow professionally
and personally.

00:24:40.386 --> 00:24:42.926
That however, will come
with work on your part.

00:24:43.846 --> 00:24:46.146
To borrow a quote
from Andrew Carnegie,

00:24:46.766 --> 00:24:49.366
"Anything worth having
is worth working for."

00:24:50.526 --> 00:24:52.996
Therefore, it is important
that in order for you

00:24:52.996 --> 00:24:54.666
to harness the true potential

00:24:54.666 --> 00:24:57.606
of being a Carnegie Mellon
alum, that you work at it.

00:24:57.606 --> 00:25:01.356
So you need to stay
connected with the friends

00:25:01.356 --> 00:25:02.916
that you've made here
at Carnegie Mellon

00:25:03.256 --> 00:25:04.606
and help each other succeed.

00:25:05.696 --> 00:25:09.296
In addition to nurturing
that Carnegie Mellon network

00:25:09.346 --> 00:25:12.186
that they've already started,
you'll need to grow that network

00:25:12.406 --> 00:25:15.136
by attending alumni
events on campus,

00:25:15.136 --> 00:25:17.326
in your hometown and
around the world.

00:25:18.606 --> 00:25:20.366
So how do you find
these opportunities?

00:25:21.326 --> 00:25:23.846
You'll need to stay connected
with the Alumni Association

00:25:23.846 --> 00:25:27.636
by updating your contact
information in connecting

00:25:27.636 --> 00:25:30.176
with your regional
alumni chapter.

00:25:32.336 --> 00:25:35.936
And as you see, your Carnegie
Mellon Alumni network row,

00:25:36.116 --> 00:25:38.006
you'll see that you'll
benefit of being part

00:25:38.006 --> 00:25:40.696
of this exclusive
alumni community.

00:25:41.896 --> 00:25:43.566
Now, remember, you
also have a lot

00:25:43.566 --> 00:25:45.786
to offer the Carnegie
Mellon Alumni network.

00:25:46.746 --> 00:25:50.086
So, if your professor or dean
asks you to speak on a panel

00:25:50.086 --> 00:25:51.986
or to mentor a student,
say, yes.

00:25:53.076 --> 00:25:56.786
If you have a job or internship
opportunity at your company,

00:25:57.096 --> 00:26:00.046
help recruit Carnegie Mellon
students and graduates.

00:26:00.486 --> 00:26:03.726
If you're asked to interview
a student looking to apply

00:26:03.826 --> 00:26:07.766
to Carnegie Mellon or to
get involved in volunteer

00:26:07.766 --> 00:26:11.336
for the university and for
your regional network, do it.

00:26:12.156 --> 00:26:15.766
Not only will you find it
to be personally rewarding

00:26:15.766 --> 00:26:17.996
but you'll also be
playing an important role

00:26:18.256 --> 00:26:22.266
in maintaining our vibrant
alumni community, which will,

00:26:22.266 --> 00:26:26.116
in the long run, benefit you as
well as those who follow you.

00:26:26.116 --> 00:26:30.516
On behalf of the Carnegie Mellon
Alumni Association and Board,

00:26:30.986 --> 00:26:33.656
it is my pleasure
to congratulate you

00:26:34.026 --> 00:26:37.156
and to welcome you into the
Carnegie Mellon community

00:26:37.306 --> 00:26:40.956
of over 100,000 alumni
living around the globe.

00:26:41.446 --> 00:26:44.456
We're excited to see what
the future holds for you

00:26:44.576 --> 00:26:46.276
and wish you nothing
but the best.

00:26:46.566 --> 00:26:47.066

How do I look?

00:28:00.476 --> 00:28:02.556
[Laughs] All right, let's begin.

00:28:03.736 --> 00:28:05.736
My heart is in the work.

00:28:09.816 --> 00:28:13.286
Those words have followed us
throughout our college careers,

00:28:13.286 --> 00:28:13.926
haven't they?

00:28:14.796 --> 00:28:17.696
They were pressed into our
minds during orientation,

00:28:18.136 --> 00:28:21.426
spoken with passion and rigor
by university officials,

00:28:21.706 --> 00:28:24.766
upper classmen and
staff, as they promised us

00:28:24.926 --> 00:28:27.506
that we too would put
our hearts in the work.

00:28:28.116 --> 00:28:30.086
We would be Andrew Carnegie.

00:28:30.516 --> 00:28:34.826
When I was a high school
junior, those words inspired me.

00:28:35.556 --> 00:28:37.576
My favorite subject
in school was Latin

00:28:37.576 --> 00:28:40.326
and I thought I would
never drink in college.

00:28:42.356 --> 00:28:43.616
Oh, sorry it's raining guys.

00:28:43.746 --> 00:28:47.356
I walked through
Carnegie Mellon's campus

00:28:47.356 --> 00:28:50.806
and I saw myself here, in a
worlds of people passionate

00:28:50.806 --> 00:28:53.686
about their studies and
passionate about the future.

00:28:53.826 --> 00:28:59.846
When I was a freshmen, "My heart
is in the work," challenged me.

00:29:00.016 --> 00:29:02.806
I think it challenged
all of us, right?

00:29:02.806 --> 00:29:08.646
Challenged us to sign up for
the most student organizations

00:29:08.646 --> 00:29:10.216
at the activities fair.

00:29:10.216 --> 00:29:11.956
I don't know about you
but I think I'm still

00:29:11.956 --> 00:29:13.056
on the "Tartans" D-list.

00:29:14.736 --> 00:29:17.886
Challenged us to take on classes
we knew we probably shouldn't be

00:29:17.886 --> 00:29:20.766
taking as freshmen despite
our adviser's recommendations,

00:29:20.766 --> 00:29:25.086
and challenged us to step
out of our comfort zones.

00:29:25.916 --> 00:29:29.896
Sometimes, "My heart in the
work," translated to work hard,

00:29:29.896 --> 00:29:33.756
play hard, and each of us
interpreted that in our own way.

00:29:34.656 --> 00:29:36.876
Maybe it was going to
my first college party

00:29:37.246 --> 00:29:39.646
and seeing a guy breath
fire in front of me.

00:29:40.976 --> 00:29:44.196
Maybe it was my friend, who
called me at 6:30 in the morning

00:29:44.386 --> 00:29:46.556
from a walk home
down Morewood just

00:29:46.556 --> 00:29:47.946
to tell someone her secrets.

00:29:48.906 --> 00:29:51.256
Or maybe it was my
roommate, who started research

00:29:51.256 --> 00:29:53.896
with faculty her freshman
year and saw the path

00:29:54.266 --> 00:29:57.816
to her future laid out in
front of her bright and clear.

00:29:59.106 --> 00:30:02.356
As we progressed through
college though, "My heart is

00:30:02.356 --> 00:30:04.286
in the work" took
on a nasty meaning.

00:30:04.906 --> 00:30:07.846
It became a curse, a
pejorative, a joke.

00:30:08.636 --> 00:30:12.936
It became something we muttered
at 3 a.m. while struggling

00:30:12.976 --> 00:30:15.726
through our problem sets
or during long weekends

00:30:15.726 --> 00:30:18.076
in practice rooms
and acting studios.

00:30:19.296 --> 00:30:20.806
Were our hearts really
in the work

00:30:20.996 --> 00:30:24.296
as we planned another event,
we knew nobody would attend.

00:30:25.336 --> 00:30:28.166
And were our hearts in the
work at midnight on Sundays

00:30:28.166 --> 00:30:31.066
in Hunt library trying
to finish lab reports,

00:30:31.556 --> 00:30:33.606
gorging on snack
food and Red Bull.

00:30:34.226 --> 00:30:37.936
In the middle of
my sophomore year,

00:30:38.186 --> 00:30:41.626
I sat in my adviser's office
asking him for guidance

00:30:41.726 --> 00:30:42.926
about what to do that summer.

00:30:43.416 --> 00:30:45.326
I didn't know where to go.

00:30:45.566 --> 00:30:48.926
I felt like I should start
doing research because everyone

00:30:48.926 --> 00:30:50.836
in the chemistry
department does research

00:30:51.326 --> 00:30:53.846
and sophomore summer was
too late to start research

00:30:53.846 --> 00:30:55.396
and I wanted to take
more writing classes

00:30:55.396 --> 00:30:58.006
and I wouldn't have time for
research during the year,

00:30:58.006 --> 00:30:59.316
I just couldn't do at all.

00:30:59.526 --> 00:31:02.766
I grew frantic, panicked
and I was about to cry

00:31:03.536 --> 00:31:07.256
when he just calmly looked
at me and he said, "Sophie,

00:31:07.786 --> 00:31:09.806
over the past year,
it had seemed

00:31:09.806 --> 00:31:12.276
that chemistry has
excited you less and less

00:31:13.016 --> 00:31:14.906
and other things have
excited you more."

00:31:16.096 --> 00:31:19.726
And just like that, a whole
world opened up for me.

00:31:20.866 --> 00:31:24.216
The thing was I loved
putting my heart into work.

00:31:24.376 --> 00:31:26.226
I think we all did, right?

00:31:26.966 --> 00:31:29.646
I loved hearing my friends
tell me about their research

00:31:29.646 --> 00:31:31.766
and I love the moment
I understood what they

00:31:31.766 --> 00:31:32.406
were saying.

00:31:33.016 --> 00:31:36.706
I got the science,
yehey, science,

00:31:37.576 --> 00:31:39.686
but it meant something
special to them

00:31:39.686 --> 00:31:43.516
and it didn't mean
anything special to me.

00:31:43.816 --> 00:31:47.476
I had spent time
and energy and heart

00:31:47.476 --> 00:31:52.106
on a field I thought I could
settle into and settle for.

00:31:53.146 --> 00:31:57.586
But when it came down to it, I
realized it was stupid to settle

00:31:58.126 --> 00:31:59.266
when other people weren't.

00:31:59.676 --> 00:32:04.416
I realized the things that have
brought me the most satisfaction

00:32:04.416 --> 00:32:06.836
during my time here were
outside the classroom

00:32:06.896 --> 00:32:10.436
of my primary major and
I don't think I'm alone.

00:32:11.086 --> 00:32:13.096
It's not that my heart
wasn't in the work,

00:32:13.346 --> 00:32:15.336
it was just in other work.

00:32:16.206 --> 00:32:19.386
It was in other classes, in
another academic department

00:32:19.386 --> 00:32:21.606
that wasn't on the path
I imagined for myself

00:32:22.286 --> 00:32:24.916
but that made me feel like
I was doing something new,

00:32:25.116 --> 00:32:26.176
something meaningful.

00:32:27.256 --> 00:32:29.396
But, two majors weren't enough.

00:32:29.926 --> 00:32:32.296
Is enough ever enough
for CMU kids?

00:32:33.076 --> 00:32:37.576
I threw myself into planning
recruitment with my sorority,

00:32:37.576 --> 00:32:40.206
Alpha Chi Omega,
and I spent hours

00:32:40.206 --> 00:32:42.576
with the feminist club
watching with glee

00:32:42.576 --> 00:32:45.966
as I saw an entire lecture hall
filled with students taking time

00:32:45.966 --> 00:32:47.376
to hear about women's bodies.

00:32:48.456 --> 00:32:50.086
It was more than
just other work.

00:32:50.246 --> 00:32:54.826
I found love in late night
meetings with executive boards,

00:32:55.386 --> 00:32:57.986
performing weird skits with
the Chemistry Department

00:32:58.266 --> 00:32:59.166
and building a booth.

00:33:00.296 --> 00:33:03.736
Extracurriculars became
another academic program,

00:33:03.936 --> 00:33:06.726
another degree, another
world outside problem sets,

00:33:07.536 --> 00:33:11.026
a world of GroupMe text, Doodle
Polls and Google Calendar.

00:33:11.026 --> 00:33:13.916
Who among us doesn't
know these worlds?

00:33:15.496 --> 00:33:19.786
Whether we were RAs, TAs,
research team members,

00:33:20.016 --> 00:33:22.136
team captains or
chapter presidents,

00:33:22.786 --> 00:33:26.756
no one is leaving this campus
without having been a part

00:33:26.756 --> 00:33:31.196
of something outside the
work we set out to do.

00:33:31.446 --> 00:33:35.826
Why did these activities seem to
matter just as much if not more

00:33:35.826 --> 00:33:39.036
than another assignment to turn
in by the midnight deadline?

00:33:40.176 --> 00:33:41.626
Somewhere along the line,

00:33:41.966 --> 00:33:44.806
the people around us
became friends we connected

00:33:44.806 --> 00:33:49.386
with on a different level
than just getting things done.

00:33:49.586 --> 00:33:52.426
You've probably heard that
we're among the smartest,

00:33:52.426 --> 00:33:55.316
best educated, most
privileged people in the world.

00:33:56.166 --> 00:33:57.126
Well, duh.

00:33:57.296 --> 00:34:02.476
Despite the trials
and difficulties,

00:34:02.626 --> 00:34:05.906
each of us have faced
both inside and outside

00:34:06.046 --> 00:34:08.136
of this tiny, tiny campus.

00:34:08.766 --> 00:34:13.636
We are all incredibly lucky to
be above all else super smart.

00:34:14.876 --> 00:34:17.146
Come on, pat yourself
on the back smart asses.

00:34:17.146 --> 00:34:21.616
You know what that
means, don't you?

00:34:22.766 --> 00:34:24.646
We can't waste our brains.

00:34:25.956 --> 00:34:30.426
We have an obligation to
do things that matter.

00:34:31.246 --> 00:34:35.136
Carnegie Mellon has not been
an amazing experience just

00:34:35.326 --> 00:34:36.506
because of our classes.

00:34:37.216 --> 00:34:41.116
As we head out to careers,
to graduate programs,

00:34:41.116 --> 00:34:45.626
to our parent's coaches, we
must realize that sometimes,

00:34:45.976 --> 00:34:49.326
what made us happiest at
CMU wasn't the work itself,

00:34:50.196 --> 00:34:54.406
it was the heart put into things
and the care, it was the TAs

00:34:54.406 --> 00:34:58.716
who guided us through concepts
of mathematics and the friends

00:34:58.716 --> 00:35:01.036
who helped us solve problems
that would never end,

00:35:01.946 --> 00:35:05.706
the advisers and professors,
who guided us towards paths

00:35:05.706 --> 00:35:10.446
with meaning and purpose and
the times we became mentors,

00:35:10.756 --> 00:35:13.976
leaders and guides.

00:35:14.156 --> 00:35:16.786
"My heart is in the
work", doesn't tell us

00:35:16.846 --> 00:35:19.066
to mindlessly dedicate
our hearts

00:35:19.146 --> 00:35:21.156
to working for the sake of work.

00:35:22.016 --> 00:35:25.756
It's a promise to
bring heart into work,

00:35:26.786 --> 00:35:29.156
to do the things
we do with heart,

00:35:29.616 --> 00:35:32.456
with passion and with care.

00:35:33.046 --> 00:35:36.476
Now, I'm not saying each of
us should dedicate our lives

00:35:36.566 --> 00:35:38.476
to solving the world's
biggest problems,

00:35:39.296 --> 00:35:41.956
although like at least
one of us should do

00:35:41.956 --> 00:35:43.556
with the sustainable
energy crisis.

00:35:44.256 --> 00:35:46.866
Chemical engineers, maybe
material science, one of you,

00:35:47.716 --> 00:35:50.656
can one of you take of that.

00:35:51.296 --> 00:35:51.796
Thank you.

00:35:53.086 --> 00:35:56.926
But honestly most
of us are going

00:35:56.926 --> 00:36:00.616
to spend the next five
maybe 10 years doing stuff

00:36:00.616 --> 00:36:06.236
that isn't our dream job
and that's OK, it's normal.

00:36:06.516 --> 00:36:09.926
The things, I found myself,
able to put the most passion

00:36:09.926 --> 00:36:13.046
into during my time here
were outside the classroom.

00:36:13.526 --> 00:36:15.146
Maybe work will be
like that too.

00:36:16.136 --> 00:36:19.436
Maybe some of us will struggle
to find meaning in the nine

00:36:19.436 --> 00:36:26.296
to five, in tax forms and hour
long commutes but what I ask

00:36:26.296 --> 00:36:31.326
of all and what I
hope for my self is

00:36:31.326 --> 00:36:33.816
that we put our hearts
into a work.

00:36:34.026 --> 00:36:35.986
We know how to work hard,

00:36:36.566 --> 00:36:40.326
we've spent how many
years practicing it?

00:36:40.596 --> 00:36:44.106
Our more challenging work will
be to work with our hearts.

00:36:45.316 --> 00:36:50.746
To bring not only skill, talent
and intelligence but kindness,

00:36:51.336 --> 00:36:55.236
thoughts and love into
what we do everyday,

00:36:56.046 --> 00:36:59.466
into our work places,
communities and families.

00:37:00.276 --> 00:37:04.306
To treat the people outside
the Carnegie Mellon bubble

00:37:04.806 --> 00:37:07.416
with the same respects
and wide-eyed wonder

00:37:07.466 --> 00:37:08.866
as we treated each other.

00:37:10.336 --> 00:37:16.496
To view the world as
optimistically as we did here.

00:37:16.706 --> 00:37:19.536
While Andrew Carnegie is--
was a great business man,

00:37:19.796 --> 00:37:22.396
he is not remembered
for his business.

00:37:23.116 --> 00:37:26.566
He's remembered for his
philanthropy, Carnegie Hall,

00:37:26.566 --> 00:37:29.906
Carnegie Museums, the
Carnegie Libraries,

00:37:30.366 --> 00:37:31.936
Carnegie Mellon University.

00:37:31.936 --> 00:37:36.716
Andrew Carnegie spends his
entire life putting his hearts

00:37:36.716 --> 00:37:41.596
into work but his great sorrow
was to wait until the end

00:37:41.596 --> 00:37:46.736
of his career to put heart into
the arts, education, service,

00:37:47.396 --> 00:37:52.266
the good of the common man,
the things he cared about.

00:37:52.466 --> 00:37:56.436
Why shouldn't we in
spirits of innovation,

00:37:56.806 --> 00:37:58.726
improved upon his legacy.

00:37:59.636 --> 00:38:04.856
As we leave Class of 2016,
let's make, "My hearts is

00:38:04.856 --> 00:38:09.656
in the work," a promise to
bring our hearts into our work.

00:38:10.376 --> 00:38:10.876
Thank you.

00:38:11.516 --> 00:38:21.976
[ Applause ]

00:38:22.476 --> 00:38:23.306
&gt;&gt; Thank you Sophie.

00:38:24.326 --> 00:38:26.186
Now we come to the presentation

00:38:26.436 --> 00:38:30.556
of special doctors degrees
awarded to honor individuals

00:38:31.466 --> 00:38:34.576
who have had extraordinary
impact in areas

00:38:35.086 --> 00:38:40.306
that reflect Carnegie Mellon's
trends in the arts, sciences,

00:38:41.006 --> 00:38:43.666
scholarship and society.

00:38:44.946 --> 00:38:47.206
Recipients of these
honorary degrees have

00:38:47.206 --> 00:38:50.786
in common a notable
record of achievement

00:38:50.786 --> 00:38:52.326
in their chosen fields.

00:38:53.136 --> 00:38:57.076
And they've made in their
own domains substantial

00:38:57.076 --> 00:39:01.286
contributions to the advancement
of knowledge, the enrichment

00:39:01.286 --> 00:39:03.156
of the arts and culture,

00:39:03.826 --> 00:39:07.056
are to bettering the
well-being of humanity.

00:39:08.356 --> 00:39:12.986
Provost Farnam Jahanian
will present each candidate

00:39:12.986 --> 00:39:16.406
and sight the achievements
that merit this honor.

00:39:17.486 --> 00:39:20.216
Then all candidates will
together receive their degrees

travel the world and realize

00:52:23.076 --> 00:52:26.466
that other people have actually
made their way from the Norfolk,

00:52:26.466 --> 00:52:28.266
Portsmouth, Tidewater
area to other parts

00:52:28.266 --> 00:52:29.226
of the country as well.

00:52:29.276 --> 00:52:30.366
So, salute.

00:52:33.826 --> 00:52:35.386
Super thank you for
that introduction.

00:52:35.386 --> 00:52:38.596
I was reminded that
yesterday would have been my

00:52:38.596 --> 00:52:39.586
mother's birthday.

00:52:39.586 --> 00:52:41.336
She past away a few years ago,

00:52:41.766 --> 00:52:43.216
she would have love
that introduction.

00:52:43.746 --> 00:52:44.896
I have to say.

00:52:45.196 --> 00:52:48.736
Good morning to you all and I
think it is still good morning.

00:52:50.306 --> 00:52:50.806
Good morning!

00:52:51.176 --> 00:52:51.666
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously]
Good morning.

00:52:51.666 --> 00:52:52.756
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:52:53.256 --> 00:52:55.946
We gather this Sunday
morning to salute you.

00:52:55.946 --> 00:52:59.466
The Carnegie Mellon
University class of 2016,

00:52:59.726 --> 00:53:02.436
for staying the course,
overcoming challenges,

00:53:02.886 --> 00:53:04.286
setting aside failures,

00:53:04.676 --> 00:53:08.096
appropriately accepting
success and graduating.

00:53:09.556 --> 00:53:11.236
This is an awesome achievement

00:53:11.236 --> 00:53:12.876
and I'm honored to
share in a moment.

00:53:13.856 --> 00:53:17.246
In fact, I would like to thank
Subra Suresh, president of CMU

00:53:17.346 --> 00:53:19.606
and Provost Farnam
Jahanian and as well

00:53:19.606 --> 00:53:21.986
as the Carnegie Mellon
University Board of Trustees

00:53:21.986 --> 00:53:25.796
for this wonderful opportunity
to receive an honorary degree

00:53:26.316 --> 00:53:28.296
from this spectacular
institution.

00:53:29.496 --> 00:53:32.246
My personal relationship
with Carnegie Mellon began

00:53:32.246 --> 00:53:35.426
over three decades ago with
my good friend, Joe Trotter,

00:53:35.696 --> 00:53:38.526
Dr. Joe Trotter invited me
to speak about my research

00:53:39.166 --> 00:53:40.666
on African-American migrants.

00:53:41.516 --> 00:53:45.196
Inevitably that opportunity
yielded the privilege of serving

00:53:45.196 --> 00:53:48.956
on the CMU humanities and social
sciences college review panel.

00:53:49.526 --> 00:53:51.626
Chairing an external
review committee

00:53:51.626 --> 00:53:54.006
for the history department
and having the chance

00:53:54.126 --> 00:53:58.386
to assist Dr. Trotter in funding
and launching cause the center

00:53:58.386 --> 00:54:00.936
for African-American urban
studies and the economy,

00:54:01.546 --> 00:54:04.546
which has just recently
celebrated its 20th anniversary.

00:54:04.546 --> 00:54:07.906
Yes, that's great.

00:54:08.516 --> 00:54:11.506
[ Applause ]

00:54:12.006 --> 00:54:15.896
Now, I am both humble and
delighted to speak on behalf

00:54:16.006 --> 00:54:18.766
of this year's very diverse
and distinguished class

00:54:18.866 --> 00:54:20.346
of honorary degree recipients.

00:54:20.956 --> 00:54:23.776
A group that includes, as
you've heard an acclaimed stage

00:54:23.776 --> 00:54:27.266
of screen star who counts among
her accomplishments an Academy

00:54:27.266 --> 00:54:29.516
Award, a Golden Globe
and two Emmy's.

00:54:30.106 --> 00:54:32.796
A television icon and
Emmy Award winning writer

00:54:32.796 --> 00:54:36.486
and actress who's influenced the
lives of millions of children.

00:54:37.186 --> 00:54:42.966
A prolific innovator with over
1100 patterns world wide and one

00:54:42.966 --> 00:54:45.726
of the most successful venture
capitalist in the world.

00:54:46.246 --> 00:54:48.806
Graduates, make a
note to yourself,

00:54:49.726 --> 00:54:50.986
learn more about these folks.

00:54:53.526 --> 00:54:56.426
It is also an honor to be
standing here before a group

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:58.406
of students that
has been embedded

00:54:58.406 --> 00:55:01.086
by the vigorous academic
standards and requirements

00:55:01.086 --> 00:55:03.146
of one of the world's
finest universities.

00:55:03.916 --> 00:55:06.766
You have been given the Carnegie
Mellon stamp of approval.

00:55:06.766 --> 00:55:10.346
And with it comes
at a certain level

00:55:10.736 --> 00:55:13.506
of attainment and
responsibility.

00:55:14.306 --> 00:55:16.386
Now, many years ago,
as you've heard,

00:55:16.386 --> 00:55:19.606
I walked across a similar stage
at a small liberal arts college

00:55:19.606 --> 00:55:21.776
in Minnesota to accept
my diploma.

00:55:23.006 --> 00:55:25.646
Like many of you, I was
able to join the ranks

00:55:25.646 --> 00:55:28.656
of the newly educated because
someone believed in me.

00:55:29.496 --> 00:55:32.696
In my case, it was started
with my maternal grandmother.

00:55:33.346 --> 00:55:37.746
While her dream was deferred,
she strategized to ensure

00:55:37.746 --> 00:55:39.946
that my dream would
not be denied.

00:55:39.946 --> 00:55:42.746
It was the early 20th century

00:55:42.746 --> 00:55:45.516
and my grandmother
had saved money twice

00:55:46.596 --> 00:55:48.346
to attend Saint Augustine
College

00:55:48.346 --> 00:55:49.576
in Raleigh, North Carolina.

00:55:50.296 --> 00:55:53.606
Each time she did, her father
asked her for the money

00:55:53.786 --> 00:55:56.286
to save an older brother
from loosing his home.

00:55:57.116 --> 00:55:58.846
The sad truth is he lost

00:55:58.846 --> 00:56:00.636
that home during the
great depression.

00:56:01.326 --> 00:56:05.306
A domestic in the
segregated south for most

00:56:05.306 --> 00:56:09.276
of her working days, my
grandmother preserved her dream

00:56:09.276 --> 00:56:12.306
of being educated
by passing it along.

00:56:13.466 --> 00:56:16.796
When it came time for my--
her daughter, my mother,

00:56:17.156 --> 00:56:20.436
to graduate from high school,
my grandmother send her first

00:56:20.986 --> 00:56:23.776
to the Norfolk division
of Virginia State,

00:56:23.776 --> 00:56:25.426
today is Norfolk
State University.

00:56:26.336 --> 00:56:28.876
But my grandmother feared
the demands of living

00:56:28.876 --> 00:56:32.426
at home would distract my
mother from her studies.

00:56:32.426 --> 00:56:34.016
So, this God fearing,

00:56:34.016 --> 00:56:36.866
church going woman
played the daily number

00:56:37.856 --> 00:56:40.996
of what was it referred to back
then as a poor person's lottery.

00:56:42.346 --> 00:56:45.296
And she won.

00:56:45.876 --> 00:56:48.286
Even though my grandmother
could have used that money

00:56:48.286 --> 00:56:51.786
to ease the burdens of her
own life, she chose instead

00:56:51.786 --> 00:56:55.076
to send my mother to
Saint Agustin College,

00:56:55.636 --> 00:56:57.946
because she believed
just that fervently

00:56:58.316 --> 00:57:00.966
in the transformative
power of education.

00:57:02.416 --> 00:57:05.896
When I came along, the
only question I was allowed

00:57:05.896 --> 00:57:10.186
to entertain was, which
college will you attend?

00:57:10.696 --> 00:57:12.326
So, I stand before you today,

00:57:12.326 --> 00:57:14.526
because of my grandmother's
determination

00:57:14.866 --> 00:57:16.716
to pay a dream forward.

00:57:17.306 --> 00:57:20.006
My mother and I inherited
the belief

00:57:20.006 --> 00:57:22.716
that the educated
have a responsibility

00:57:22.716 --> 00:57:26.226
to pay back the faith
invested in them by working

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:29.066
to in some way, improve
the world.

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:32.386
Let's see, let's
see a show of hands,

00:57:32.506 --> 00:57:36.826
how many of you have family,
friends and teachers who back

00:57:37.106 --> 00:57:40.276
and supported you through your
higher education experience?

00:57:43.566 --> 00:57:44.066
Thank you.

00:57:44.196 --> 00:57:47.326
Please join me in recognizing
these special individuals

00:57:47.586 --> 00:57:49.936
with a ruckus round of applause.

00:57:50.516 --> 00:58:00.786
[ Applause ]

00:58:01.286 --> 00:58:02.106
Their job is done.

00:58:02.816 --> 00:58:06.286
And in fact, if you listen
closely, you'll hear some sighs

00:58:06.286 --> 00:58:08.576
of relief coming from
parents in the audience.

00:58:10.146 --> 00:58:13.466
Now, your job like mine
when I graduated is

00:58:13.466 --> 00:58:16.516
to never confuse the
attainment of an education

00:58:16.736 --> 00:58:18.726
with what it means
to be educated.

00:58:19.666 --> 00:58:21.906
Graduation marks
a moment in time

00:58:22.226 --> 00:58:25.156
when you have assembled
the necessary credits

00:58:25.156 --> 00:58:26.236
to earn a degree.

00:58:27.016 --> 00:58:29.976
But, being educated, being
educated requires you

00:58:29.976 --> 00:58:33.846
to deploy the discipline of
mind that comes with a pursuit

00:58:33.846 --> 00:58:36.926
of knowledge for the
betterment not only of yourself

00:58:36.926 --> 00:58:41.356
and your family, but
also, the greater society.

00:58:42.606 --> 00:58:45.996
I graduated in a
post-Vietnam era of gas lines,

00:58:46.316 --> 00:58:48.746
student protests and
racial desegregation.

00:58:49.576 --> 00:58:53.206
I knew what had been and what
was happening at the time.

00:58:53.786 --> 00:58:56.686
But, I had no idea
what to expect

00:58:56.686 --> 00:58:58.386
in the years and
decades to come.

00:58:59.416 --> 00:59:03.376
For example, in 1978,
it was nearly impossible

00:59:03.376 --> 00:59:05.516
to conceive of desktop
computers.

00:59:06.606 --> 00:59:09.626
Much less, a world so
completely integrated

00:59:09.626 --> 00:59:12.396
with powerful personal
computing ability

00:59:12.426 --> 00:59:13.656
that resides in the phone.

00:59:13.716 --> 00:59:17.576
Just think about that, it
hasn't been that long ago.

00:59:19.466 --> 00:59:21.906
Back then, when I
imagined a future,

00:59:22.216 --> 00:59:25.156
I pictured a world
akin to Jetson's.

00:59:25.806 --> 00:59:31.556
There are people in
this audience old enough

00:59:31.646 --> 00:59:34.396
to remember the Jetson's.

00:59:34.396 --> 00:59:35.606
A primetime animated series

00:59:35.606 --> 00:59:38.306
that predated the
Simpson's by almost 30 years.

00:59:39.126 --> 00:59:42.126
It's world was populated
with space age families,

00:59:42.406 --> 00:59:44.586
sassy robots and flying cars.

00:59:45.486 --> 00:59:47.696
Computers delivered
both instant meals

00:59:47.696 --> 00:59:52.006
and instantaneous medical
diagnosis and cures for diseases

00:59:52.006 --> 00:59:55.156
where it's just one individually
formulated pill away.

00:59:56.546 --> 00:59:57.836
Flash forward to today.

00:59:58.056 --> 01:00:02.726
And flying cars are still a
matter of fantasy, but we aren't

01:00:02.726 --> 01:00:05.416
that far away from a semi
autonomous automobile.

01:00:06.356 --> 01:00:09.296
Gene mapping is almost common
place in the development

01:00:09.336 --> 01:00:11.206
of customized treatment plans.

01:00:11.856 --> 01:00:14.846
Robotics is now offered
as part of the curriculum

01:00:14.936 --> 01:00:17.586
in many high schools
across the United States.

01:00:17.646 --> 01:00:20.326
And artificial intelligent
protocols

01:00:20.726 --> 01:00:24.796
such as IBM's Watson
regularly beat humans at games

01:00:24.796 --> 01:00:26.006
of knowledge and logic.

01:00:28.016 --> 01:00:30.186
It is said that at CMU,

01:00:30.186 --> 01:00:34.136
you do not imagine the
future, you create it.

01:00:34.796 --> 01:00:37.476
But it indulged me
for few seconds.

01:00:38.076 --> 01:00:41.156
Look at here, graduates,
look at here to 25 years

01:00:41.156 --> 01:00:43.226
from now, what do you see?

01:00:43.226 --> 01:00:49.476
Marriage, children, family,
maybe divorce and success.

01:00:52.846 --> 01:00:53.426
It's true.

01:00:54.516 --> 01:00:56.906
[ Laughter ]

01:00:57.406 --> 01:00:59.716
But, what about on
the technology front?

01:01:00.226 --> 01:01:03.606
Will it be that the discipline
of robotics is ushered

01:01:03.606 --> 01:01:06.856
in a new age of productivity
and profitability.

01:01:07.426 --> 01:01:10.296
A world where artificial
intelligence alters the make

01:01:10.296 --> 01:01:14.236
up of the work as well as the
composition of the workforce.

01:01:15.246 --> 01:01:19.436
Today, a single retailer can
employ nearly 100,000 people

01:01:19.436 --> 01:01:21.496
around the nation
to move products

01:01:21.526 --> 01:01:24.196
from regional sites
to consumer homes.

01:01:24.766 --> 01:01:26.576
That is sort of a speculation,

01:01:26.756 --> 01:01:29.756
the robots could replace
these workers in short order,

01:01:29.756 --> 01:01:32.786
not next year, but tomorrow.

01:01:33.926 --> 01:01:34.636
What happens then?

01:01:36.006 --> 01:01:38.106
Do we simply shrug
and acknowledge

01:01:38.106 --> 01:01:40.496
that progress always
comes at a price

01:01:41.606 --> 01:01:44.506
or do we examine
the broader social

01:01:44.746 --> 01:01:46.336
and economic implications.

01:01:47.676 --> 01:01:51.526
Graduates, many of you will
certainly be the architects

01:01:51.526 --> 01:01:53.466
of the next technological
revolution.

01:01:54.236 --> 01:01:56.886
But while you are developing
devices and programs

01:01:56.886 --> 01:02:00.146
that enhance deficiency and
perhaps even save lives,

01:02:00.506 --> 01:02:04.466
you must also simultaneously
challenge yourselves to solve

01:02:04.466 --> 01:02:08.066
for the impact of
these advancements.

01:02:08.066 --> 01:02:11.446
As our economy shifts away
from human base work--

01:02:11.446 --> 01:02:14.836
from a human base workforce
to machine driven labor,

01:02:15.246 --> 01:02:16.906
will you make accommodations

01:02:16.956 --> 01:02:20.406
for the newly technologically
disenfranchised?

01:02:21.736 --> 01:02:24.136
Undoubtedly, CMU
has prepared you

01:02:24.136 --> 01:02:27.776
to meet the exponentially
increasing technological demands

01:02:27.776 --> 01:02:29.966
of a growing global economy

01:02:30.146 --> 01:02:32.646
in a more environmentally
conscious manner.

01:02:32.996 --> 01:02:37.506
But, what additional tools
and insights might you need

01:02:37.506 --> 01:02:39.496
to be both successful
contributors

01:02:40.066 --> 01:02:41.866
and successful global citizens?

01:02:43.386 --> 01:02:46.966
Twenty five years from now
with the courses that you took

01:02:46.966 --> 01:02:49.416
in history, philosophy
and literature.

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:53.176
Your experimentation
with theater and the arts

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.996
or your inter-disciplinary
courses

01:02:55.996 --> 01:02:59.816
and study abroad proved
just as useful as the work

01:02:59.816 --> 01:03:01.876
that made you a student
of science,

01:03:02.326 --> 01:03:05.006
math and engineering or not.

01:03:06.056 --> 01:03:09.356
For those of you in the arts and
the humanities, will the value

01:03:09.356 --> 01:03:13.216
of your degree decrease in
a technology focused world

01:03:13.526 --> 01:03:16.636
or increase because
people with your background

01:03:16.636 --> 01:03:19.736
and training are
suddenly in short supply.

01:03:21.156 --> 01:03:25.446
It is critical that all of you
invasion yourselves as part

01:03:25.786 --> 01:03:30.336
of a creative society, which
produces creative solutions.

01:03:31.506 --> 01:03:34.016
Though historically, we
have looked to those coming

01:03:34.016 --> 01:03:35.666
out of the arts and humanities

01:03:35.666 --> 01:03:39.356
to help us transform what
we know and how we know it.

01:03:41.526 --> 01:03:43.376
Today, engineering, math

01:03:43.376 --> 01:03:45.976
and computer science
have truly evolved

01:03:45.976 --> 01:03:47.106
into creative disciplines.

01:03:48.016 --> 01:03:51.326
More people worldwide
are familiar with theory

01:03:51.326 --> 01:03:55.946
that any book, play or essay
written in the last 100 years.

01:03:57.126 --> 01:04:00.596
The engineers and technologies
at Apple have created something

01:04:00.596 --> 01:04:02.956
that it's infiltrated
our consciousness

01:04:02.956 --> 01:04:05.646
like few other works
of art ever have.

01:04:06.086 --> 01:04:08.296
And that's actually important
to think about and dwell on

01:04:08.366 --> 01:04:09.946
and think through
the implications.

01:04:11.016 --> 01:04:12.386
Yet, science, engineering

01:04:12.386 --> 01:04:17.016
and math alone are not
enough, case and point, 9/11.

01:04:18.116 --> 01:04:21.396
Despite the utilization of
very sophisticated machinery

01:04:21.396 --> 01:04:23.006
and highly skilled technicians,

01:04:23.406 --> 01:04:25.486
we failed to intercept
the terrorists,

01:04:25.576 --> 01:04:29.356
because 9/11 have more to do
with religion and ideology

01:04:30.636 --> 01:04:35.296
than with probes, drowns
and surveillance devices.

01:04:35.436 --> 01:04:38.886
Similarly, engineers
successfully build a well

01:04:38.886 --> 01:04:40.986
in the West African
village not to long ago

01:04:41.256 --> 01:04:45.376
to ensure a ready supply of
clean water, yet failed to take

01:04:45.376 --> 01:04:47.946
into consideration broader
culture implications.

01:04:48.496 --> 01:04:52.076
To their surprise, the women
who haul the water continue

01:04:52.076 --> 01:04:55.816
to walk all the way to the
river, despite the risk.

01:04:56.196 --> 01:04:58.946
When question by anthropologist,
the women explained

01:04:58.946 --> 01:05:03.086
that no one had asked them
where to build the well.

01:05:03.236 --> 01:05:06.566
You see, the hauling of the
water had a social function

01:05:06.926 --> 01:05:08.676
as well as the utilitarian one.

01:05:09.286 --> 01:05:12.516
The women use their time
to socialize and get away

01:05:12.516 --> 01:05:16.406
from their children
and the men folk.

01:05:17.036 --> 01:05:20.876
Both of these examples serve
as the powerful reminder

01:05:21.076 --> 01:05:24.996
that studying a multiplicity
of perspectives has real worth

01:05:24.996 --> 01:05:27.256
when we are trying to
solve real problems.

01:05:28.146 --> 01:05:31.276
Human interaction, as we
all well know is messy.

01:05:31.966 --> 01:05:34.306
It's not always scientifically
based

01:05:34.386 --> 01:05:37.516
or mathematically
predictable, nor is it linear.

01:05:38.536 --> 01:05:40.846
Sometimes, you simply
cannot get from point A

01:05:40.846 --> 01:05:43.466
to point B in a straight line.

01:05:45.096 --> 01:05:48.806
This is to suggest that the
world is complex and the issues

01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:50.576
that we face are indeed complex.

01:05:51.076 --> 01:05:53.636
And that it requires
that technologist consult

01:05:53.706 --> 01:05:56.996
with social scientist, that
humanist work with engineers

01:05:57.366 --> 01:06:00.396
and that scientist and art has
collaborate to solve problems

01:06:00.616 --> 01:06:02.086
and try new possibilities.

01:06:03.586 --> 01:06:07.636
Graduates, as we move forward
in life, and as you move forward

01:06:07.636 --> 01:06:11.666
in life, you must strive to be
in conversations across lines

01:06:11.756 --> 01:06:14.856
of difference, exchange
in insights and ideas

01:06:14.856 --> 01:06:18.896
and a profound and noble way
with people of different racial,

01:06:19.676 --> 01:06:22.056
academic and socio-economic
backgrounds.

01:06:22.826 --> 01:06:24.666
Luckily, today's technologies--

01:06:24.666 --> 01:06:29.206
it clips time and distance
making it possible for you

01:06:29.206 --> 01:06:31.346
to connect in real
time with people

01:06:31.346 --> 01:06:32.916
in different geographic zones

01:06:33.276 --> 01:06:35.826
across the United States
and around the world.

01:06:37.076 --> 01:06:40.186
You will also need to recognize
the importance of being embedded

01:06:40.186 --> 01:06:42.486
in community and
actively working

01:06:42.486 --> 01:06:44.966
to improve the American
form of democracy.

01:06:45.726 --> 01:06:48.836
That's not just about
voting, it's about the ways

01:06:48.836 --> 01:06:51.426
in which we think about
the opportunity for all.

01:06:52.296 --> 01:06:54.766
And actually, being able
to gather information

01:06:54.766 --> 01:06:57.986
across a broader spectrum
of media that will allow you

01:06:57.986 --> 01:07:00.456
to fashion your understanding
of the world.

01:07:01.356 --> 01:07:04.196
Or to put it bluntly, to be
able to tell the difference

01:07:04.196 --> 01:07:05.976
between garbage and
the real stuff.

01:07:06.436 --> 01:07:12.246
Now, if this election cycle is
a harbinger of things to come,

01:07:13.086 --> 01:07:14.776
successfully stored
in the garbage

01:07:14.776 --> 01:07:17.136
from the real stuff
will become the hallmark

01:07:17.416 --> 01:07:18.536
of an enlighten citizen.

01:07:18.846 --> 01:07:22.976
Yeah, we can think
about that for a second.

01:07:23.516 --> 01:07:26.486
[ Laughter and Applause ]

01:07:26.986 --> 01:07:29.796
And this would be true, whether
you are in Berlin, Beijing

01:07:29.796 --> 01:07:33.096
or Birmingham, you must
remember to ask why

01:07:33.616 --> 01:07:36.896
to research independently
to pursuit truth

01:07:37.286 --> 01:07:40.086
and to affirm your
commitment to honesty,

01:07:40.416 --> 01:07:42.456
integrity and the common good.

01:07:43.656 --> 01:07:49.016
Now, look to the future once
more, to your 25th reunion.

01:07:49.646 --> 01:07:51.536
This time, what do you see?

01:07:52.786 --> 01:07:53.606
More changes

01:07:53.606 --> 01:07:57.376
in the technological
landscape, greater diversity?

01:07:58.216 --> 01:08:00.556
How about improve connectedness?

01:08:01.016 --> 01:08:05.426
Hopefully, you see your future
selves as inextricably linked

01:08:05.426 --> 01:08:09.316
to America and the world,
both the opportunities

01:08:09.696 --> 01:08:13.176
and the challenges, because
you haven't shrunk from either.

01:08:14.326 --> 01:08:16.436
Keep looking.

01:08:16.646 --> 01:08:19.496
Are you a key player
in a creation of a new

01:08:19.496 --> 01:08:22.226
and technologically
responsible golden age?

01:08:23.176 --> 01:08:26.476
Are you balancing your desire
to create bigger, better,

01:08:26.476 --> 01:08:30.496
faster with the need to sustain
a healthy and vibrant economy

01:08:31.556 --> 01:08:33.436
in which all members
have a stake?

01:08:33.836 --> 01:08:37.506
More specifically,
are you the leader

01:08:38.086 --> 01:08:42.936
that Carnegie Mellon has
prepared you to become,

01:08:43.086 --> 01:08:48.056
or are you merely participating
in a creation of cool new stuff?

01:08:48.716 --> 01:08:52.696
I challenge you, I challenge
you, because you are the best

01:08:52.696 --> 01:08:54.876
and the brightest as you've
heard and you will hear,

01:08:54.876 --> 01:08:57.486
no doubt, many more times
over the course of this day

01:08:57.486 --> 01:08:58.376
and the next few days.

01:08:59.186 --> 01:09:02.276
So, graduates of 2016, stand up.

[ Applause ]

01:09:17.366 --> 01:09:19.456
And I would ask that
you repeat after me.

01:09:20.766 --> 01:09:24.516
We, the 2016 graduating
class of Carnegie Mellon.

01:09:36.006 --> 01:09:37.196
&gt;&gt; Will do the unimagined.

01:09:37.196 --> 01:09:40.166
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously]
Will do the unimagined.

01:09:40.166 --> 01:09:44.176
&gt;&gt; We will discover
the undiscoverable.

01:09:44.176 --> 01:09:46.666
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] We will
discover the undiscoverable.

01:09:46.716 --> 01:09:47.776
&gt;&gt; We will change the world--

01:09:47.936 --> 01:09:49.486
&gt;&gt; [Simultaneously] We
will change the world--

01:09:49.486 --> 01:09:50.296
&gt;&gt; -- responsibly.

-- responsibly.

&gt;&gt; Let's try that one more time.

01:09:53.666 --> 01:09:55.246
We will change the
world responsibly.

change the world responsibly.

01:10:09.536 --> 01:10:09.906
Thank you.

01:10:09.906 --> 01:10:11.856
You may sit down.

01:10:12.946 --> 01:10:15.656
If you remain faithful
to this moment in time,

01:10:16.346 --> 01:10:18.636
you will have done far
more than earn a degree.

01:10:19.386 --> 01:10:22.376
You will have used your
skills, talents and intellect

01:10:22.786 --> 01:10:23.816
for the benefit of all.

01:10:23.816 --> 01:10:28.096
I am confident that you
understand the significance

01:10:28.706 --> 01:10:31.336
and I am grateful to
have had this opportunity

01:10:31.336 --> 01:10:32.956
to see you off on your journey.

01:10:34.126 --> 01:10:35.816
I'm truly excited for you.

and I extend my sincerest
congratulations.

change the world responsibly.

Your own career has
been a reflection

of that same commitment.

to acknowledge the mark
they have made at CMU.

title of University Professor.

degrees by President Suresh.

01:26:56.256 --> 01:26:58.686
President Suresh.

01:26:59.756 --> 01:27:01.876
&gt;&gt; Thank you Provost Jahanian.

01:27:03.026 --> 01:27:05.916
By virtue of the authority
granted to me by the Board

01:27:05.916 --> 01:27:10.366
of Trustees, I hereby conferred
these degrees upon these

01:27:10.366 --> 01:27:16.426
candidates with all the
rights, honors, privileges

01:27:16.836 --> 01:27:19.786
and responsibilities
pertaining there to.

01:27:20.126 --> 01:27:23.846
I'm pleased to join
the deans and faculty

01:27:23.846 --> 01:27:27.106
of the entire university
in congratulating you.

01:27:27.106 --> 01:27:28.936
Congratulations.

Will all the new bachelors,
masters and doctoral graduates

01:27:44.226 --> 01:27:47.676
of Carnegie Mellon
University, please be seated.

01:27:48.216 --> 01:27:57.176
It was just last year that we
reached 100,000 living alumni

01:27:57.176 --> 01:27:59.946
of the university in
more than 100 countries,

01:28:01.526 --> 01:28:06.786
with this commencement ceremony,
with you graduating today,

01:28:07.406 --> 01:28:12.166
we begin CMU march toward
200,000 living alumni.

01:28:12.636 --> 01:28:16.686
When I called Earl Lewis

01:28:16.686 --> 01:28:20.526
to be our commencement speaker
this year, several months ago,

01:28:21.116 --> 01:28:22.926
he asked me what
should he talk about.

01:28:23.936 --> 01:28:24.866
I said he can talk

01:28:24.866 --> 01:28:26.796
about whatever he
choses to talk about.

01:28:27.396 --> 01:28:31.226
We never compared notes, I
had no idea until he started

01:28:31.226 --> 01:28:33.026
to speak what he was
going to talk about

01:28:33.616 --> 01:28:36.466
and he had no idea what
I'm going to say now.

01:28:39.696 --> 01:28:40.966
It's all good.

01:28:42.956 --> 01:28:46.236
It turns out that we are
approaching the same,

01:28:46.306 --> 01:28:48.496
same theme from very
different angle.

01:28:48.496 --> 01:28:52.856
Unannounced to each other, we
are focusing on a similar theme.

01:28:52.856 --> 01:29:00.846
Early this year, a group of CMU
faculty members and I traveled

01:29:00.846 --> 01:29:06.106
to Switzerland to attend the
World Economic Forum in Davos.

01:29:06.746 --> 01:29:11.866
For this meeting, which attracts
world leaders, technologists,

01:29:12.496 --> 01:29:17.676
industry leaders, policy
makers, writers, film makers,

01:29:18.006 --> 01:29:21.436
performers and the global media.

01:29:21.766 --> 01:29:24.366
The World Economic
Forum choose the theme,

01:29:25.006 --> 01:29:28.006
"The Fourth Industrial
Revolution."

01:29:28.776 --> 01:29:32.186
The first industrial
revolution which started

01:29:32.186 --> 01:29:36.896
in the late 18th century,
created mechanization,

01:29:38.266 --> 01:29:42.266
specifically according
to one perspective

01:29:42.266 --> 01:29:46.296
from the World Economic
Forum, it was the year 1784

01:29:46.296 --> 01:29:50.636
and the catalyst for this
revolution was steam,

01:29:51.596 --> 01:29:55.766
water and mechanical
production equipment.

01:29:56.476 --> 01:29:59.706
A major outcome of this
revolution was the emergence

01:29:59.706 --> 01:30:04.536
of industrialize cities
where some form of human

01:30:04.636 --> 01:30:07.976
or animal labor could be
replaced by mechanical labor.

01:30:10.046 --> 01:30:14.036
Each revolution created more
advance forms of manufacturing

01:30:14.556 --> 01:30:17.646
and altered the global
economy in unprecedented

01:30:17.646 --> 01:30:19.316
and irreversible ways.

01:30:20.156 --> 01:30:23.816
The second industrial
revolution which started

01:30:23.816 --> 01:30:28.096
in the late 19th Century
created mass production.

01:30:29.706 --> 01:30:35.686
The catalyst for this revolution
considered to have begun in 1870

01:30:36.916 --> 01:30:42.436
where the division of labor,
electricity and mass production.

01:30:43.796 --> 01:30:47.696
A major outcome of this
revolution was the emergence

01:30:47.696 --> 01:30:51.446
of industrialize regions
and economies of scale.

01:30:52.066 --> 01:30:56.926
The third industrial
revolution which started

01:30:56.926 --> 01:31:03.666
in the late 20th Century created
unprecedented automation.

01:31:03.666 --> 01:31:10.156
The catalyst for this revolution
considered to have begun in 1969

01:31:11.316 --> 01:31:14.376
where micro electronics
information

01:31:14.376 --> 01:31:18.606
and communication
technologies, the internet,

01:31:18.606 --> 01:31:20.876
robotics and automation.

01:31:22.446 --> 01:31:26.856
A major outcome of this
revolution was the emergence

01:31:26.856 --> 01:31:28.636
of global production networks

01:31:29.606 --> 01:31:32.786
and the input cost were
significantly altered.

01:31:32.926 --> 01:31:38.296
The fourth industrial
revolution which many leaders

01:31:38.296 --> 01:31:41.516
who were gathered at the world
economic forum focused on,

01:31:42.626 --> 01:31:46.876
is believe to be occurring
now in the early part

01:31:46.876 --> 01:31:50.916
of the 21st century,
although no one is quite sure

01:31:50.916 --> 01:31:53.776
when exactly it began.

01:31:54.996 --> 01:32:00.006
In my view what makes the fourth
industrial revolution unlike the

01:32:00.006 --> 01:32:05.346
previous three stems from
at least a few key factors.

01:32:05.956 --> 01:32:12.466
The speed of change, the role
of the individual citizen

01:32:12.466 --> 01:32:19.426
of the world whether he or
she is educated or uneducated,

01:32:19.426 --> 01:32:25.016
is rich or poor lives
in a developed country

01:32:25.386 --> 01:32:26.756
or a developing country.

01:32:27.836 --> 01:32:31.056
He or she can engage in
a two way communication

01:32:31.446 --> 01:32:35.586
at the cutting age of the
fourth industrial revolution

01:32:35.706 --> 01:32:37.306
at lightning speed.

01:32:38.196 --> 01:32:41.756
Individual empowerment, scale

01:32:41.756 --> 01:32:44.966
in which the individual
can do enormous good

01:32:45.656 --> 01:32:47.546
and equally enormous harm.

01:32:49.336 --> 01:32:54.106
The scope of change, the
impact of that scope of change

01:32:54.106 --> 01:33:00.676
on a global system intended
versus unintended consequences,

01:33:01.536 --> 01:33:05.216
known unknowns and
unknown unknowns.

01:33:06.826 --> 01:33:09.766
You are graduating at a
particularly exciting time

01:33:10.536 --> 01:33:12.406
where the convergence
of technologies

01:33:12.406 --> 01:33:13.696
and human interactions

01:33:13.966 --> 01:33:17.676
with those technologies is
creating new possibilities

01:33:17.676 --> 01:33:21.856
and new challenges, new
solutions to problems

01:33:21.856 --> 01:33:26.006
and new tracks that
create major new problems

01:33:26.516 --> 01:33:28.496
in many domains of
day to day life.

01:33:29.736 --> 01:33:34.496
On one hand the convergence
of the digital physical

01:33:34.496 --> 01:33:37.926
and biological worlds is
generating unprecedented

01:33:37.926 --> 01:33:41.076
questions and concerns
about how governments

01:33:41.076 --> 01:33:46.026
and individuals were address
such issues as employment,

01:33:46.026 --> 01:33:52.826
income levels, equality,
ethics, security, policy,

01:33:53.486 --> 01:33:59.836
confidentiality, social
justice, taxation, diplomacy,

01:34:00.206 --> 01:34:01.486
and global attractions.

01:34:01.486 --> 01:34:05.876
At the same time the
intersections of the real

01:34:05.876 --> 01:34:09.526
and virtual world on the
tag of war between natural

01:34:09.526 --> 01:34:13.646
and artificial intelligence of
creating interesting questions

01:34:13.646 --> 01:34:18.916
about the ways in which the
21st Century will unfold during

01:34:18.916 --> 01:34:19.876
your lifetime.

01:34:20.106 --> 01:34:27.536
In your careers, say 50 years
from now, Earl Lewis talked

01:34:27.536 --> 01:34:32.446
about the next 25 years, whether
we emerge as better human beings

01:34:32.946 --> 01:34:35.746
or not will critically depend

01:34:35.746 --> 01:34:38.576
on how you shape the fourth
industrial revolution.

01:34:39.476 --> 01:34:44.016
How you use or abuse the
tools at your disposal,

01:34:44.576 --> 01:34:47.306
intentionally or intentionally.

01:34:48.486 --> 01:34:51.126
Nobody is better prepared
to shape the world

01:34:51.126 --> 01:34:54.756
than today's graduates of
Carnegie Mellon University.

01:34:56.096 --> 01:35:01.126
CMU faculty, students and
staff played a pivotal role

01:35:01.126 --> 01:35:05.316
in their pioneering work that
enabled many of the technologies

01:35:05.316 --> 01:35:07.776
that are critical to the
fourth industrial revolution.

01:35:08.956 --> 01:35:13.396
Computers and computing,
robotics, mobile communications,

01:35:13.536 --> 01:35:16.026

science of learning,

01:35:16.386 --> 01:35:19.196
artificial intelligence,
human machine interactions,

01:35:19.706 --> 01:35:22.716
tools for cyber security
and the internet of things.

01:35:24.006 --> 01:35:28.346
CMU has purposely emphasized
to you during the course

01:35:28.386 --> 01:35:29.936
of your education here.

01:35:30.406 --> 01:35:34.216
The importance of connecting the
sciences engineering, business

01:35:34.216 --> 01:35:38.256
and technologies with human
creativity and the arts,

01:35:38.596 --> 01:35:45.026
humanities, social behavior and
decision sciences and policy.

01:35:45.166 --> 01:35:47.326
CMU's own Dr. Herbert Simon,

01:35:47.856 --> 01:35:53.046
Nobel Prize Winning pioneering
professor, said in 1971,

01:35:54.516 --> 01:35:58.996
"A wealth of information
creates a poverty of attention."

01:35:59.706 --> 01:36:03.526
To paraphrase it differently,

01:36:04.296 --> 01:36:08.776
a wealth of information can
create sometimes enormous

01:36:08.776 --> 01:36:13.036
confusion between what
Earl Lewis called,

01:36:13.036 --> 01:36:14.546
"Garbage and the real stuff."

01:36:16.006 --> 01:36:18.936
Nobody is better prepared
than you to use a wealth

01:36:18.936 --> 01:36:24.346
of information deliberately
using careful thought reflection

01:36:24.346 --> 01:36:27.746
and evidence to address
major societal problems.

01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:31.726
Our five honor degree
candidates are role models

01:36:31.726 --> 01:36:34.166
in their important
connection between technologies

01:36:34.166 --> 01:36:36.456
and the human condition
that will unfold

01:36:36.456 --> 01:36:38.036
in the coming years and decades.

01:36:38.746 --> 01:36:43.186
Holly Hunter and Sonia Manzano
used their beginnings at CMU

01:36:43.356 --> 01:36:45.846
to excel in the arts
and entertainment world.

01:36:45.896 --> 01:36:50.476
And Sonia skillfully combined
the entertainment and education

01:36:50.476 --> 01:36:52.026
to inspire a young minds.

01:36:53.176 --> 01:36:56.006
Paul Belanger is a
pioneering engineer whose work

01:36:56.006 --> 01:36:58.176
at the intersections
of Engineering, Science

01:36:58.176 --> 01:37:00.726
and Medicine shaped
new technologies.

01:37:02.316 --> 01:37:04.566
Our own alumnus Jim
Schwartz excels

01:37:04.566 --> 01:37:08.336
in creating new business
opportunities economic value

01:37:08.336 --> 01:37:11.786
and societal impact on a
global scale for those kinds

01:37:11.786 --> 01:37:13.816
of rapidly emerging
technologies.

01:37:15.326 --> 01:37:18.706
Earl Lewis with a
keen eye and knowledge

01:37:18.706 --> 01:37:22.406
of history use the past to
shape the present and future

01:37:22.406 --> 01:37:24.556
by applying his intellect
and energy

01:37:24.796 --> 01:37:26.776
to expand diversity in academia.

01:37:26.886 --> 01:37:30.456
To connect the digital
world with the humanities

01:37:30.806 --> 01:37:34.116
and through his leadership roles
in academia and non-profits

01:37:34.146 --> 01:37:39.406
as many have said and as I
have said before that some

01:37:39.406 --> 01:37:41.556
of the greatest technological
achievements

01:37:41.556 --> 01:37:45.806
of the 20th century have played
a major role in creating some

01:37:45.806 --> 01:37:48.656
of the toughest grand
challenges of the 21st century.

01:37:49.736 --> 01:37:53.996
As CMU graduates and global
citizens you have exceptional

01:37:53.996 --> 01:37:56.756
talent and unique cross
disciplinary perspectives

01:37:57.576 --> 01:38:00.876
that will enable you to face
and address these tough problems

01:38:01.456 --> 01:38:05.626
without creating new challenges
for the next revolution.

01:38:06.876 --> 01:38:11.776
My congratulations to you,
to your families and friends

01:38:12.586 --> 01:38:16.706
and my enormous gratitude
to you for sharing your time

01:38:16.706 --> 01:38:19.236
