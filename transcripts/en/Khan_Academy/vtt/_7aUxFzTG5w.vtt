00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:02.990
Let's say I have two
intersecting line segments.

00:00:02.990 --> 00:00:05.552
So let's call that segment AB.

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:12.610
And then I have segment CD.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:17.390
So that is C and that is D. And
they intersect right over here

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:21.440
at point E. And let's
say we know, we're given,

00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:25.170
that this angle right over here,
that the measure of angle--

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:28.370
That B is kind of, I don't know
why I wrote it so far away.

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:30.690
So let me make that
a little bit closer.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:33.740
Let me make that B
a little bit closer.

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.610
So let's say-- I'll
do that in yellow.

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:41.240
Let's say that we know that
the measure of this angle

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.950
right over here,
angle BED, let's

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:48.920
say that we know that
measure is 70 degrees.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.260
Given that information,
what I want to do,

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.300
based only on what
we know so far

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:55.760
and not using a protractor,
what I want to do

00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:58.420
is figure out what the other
angles in this picture are.

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.210
So what's the measure of angle
CEB, the measure of angle AEC,

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:06.410
and the measure of angle AED?

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:07.840
So the first thing
that you might

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.030
notice when you
look at this, I've

00:01:09.030 --> 00:01:10.863
already told you that
this is a line segment

00:01:10.863 --> 00:01:12.460
and that this is a line segment.

00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:24.460
You see that angle BED and
angle CEB are adjacent.

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.500
And we also see that if
you take the outer sides

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:33.980
of those angles, it
forms a straight angle.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:39.080
And we also see that angle
CED is a straight angle.

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.840
So we know that these two angles
must also be supplementary.

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.580
They're next to each other
and they form a straight angle

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:53.240
when you take their outer sides.

00:01:53.240 --> 00:02:02.230
So we know that angle BED and
angle CEB are supplementary,

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:04.970
which means they add up to,
or that their measures add up

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.380
to 180 degrees.

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.930
Supplementary angles.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.940
Which tells us that
the measure of angle

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.897
BED plus the measure
of angle CEB--

00:02:19.897 --> 00:02:21.230
and I keep writing measure here.

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.930
Sometimes you'll just
see people write,

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:28.520
angle BED plus angle CEB
is equal to 180 degrees.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.780
Now we already know the measure
of angle BED is 70 degrees.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.100
So we already know that
this thing right over here

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:36.630
is 70 degrees.

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:39.460
And so 70 degrees plus
the measure of angle CEB

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.620
is 180 degrees.

00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:43.180
You subtract 70 from
both sides, and we

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:50.730
get the measure of angle
CEB is equal to 110 degrees.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.180
I just subtracted 70
from both sides of that.

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:58.979
So we figured out that this
right over here is 110 degrees.

00:02:58.979 --> 00:03:00.020
Well, that's interesting.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:01.640
And I went through
more steps than you

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:03.020
would if you were doing
this problem quickly.

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:04.540
If you did this problem quickly
in your head, you'd say,

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.280
look this is 70 degrees,
this angle plus this angle

00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:10.910
would be 180 degrees, so
this has to be 110 degrees.

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:12.920
So now let's use the
same logic to figure out

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.790
what angle CEA is.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:19.170
So now we care about the
measure of angle CEA.

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.300
And we can use the exact same
logic that we used over here.

00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:31.210
Angle CEA and angle
CEB, they are adjacent.

00:03:31.210 --> 00:03:34.160
They form a straight angle,
if you look at their outsides,

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:35.939
so they must be supplementary.

00:03:35.939 --> 00:03:37.730
They form a straight
angle right over here.

00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.771
So they're supplementary.

00:03:38.771 --> 00:03:41.410
So they must add
up to 180 degrees.

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:45.030
So the measure of angle CEA
plus the measure of angle CEB,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:50.660
which is 110 degrees, must
be equal to 180 degrees.

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:53.330
So once again, subtract
110 from both sides.

00:03:53.330 --> 00:04:01.100
You get the measure of angle
CEA is equal to 70 degrees.

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.027
So this one right over
here is also 70 degrees.

00:04:04.027 --> 00:04:05.610
And what we'll learn
in the next video

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.210
is that this is no coincidence.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:11.890
These two angles, angle
CEA and angle BED,

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:14.912
sometimes they're called
opposite angles-- well,

00:04:14.912 --> 00:04:16.620
I have often called
them opposite angles,

00:04:16.620 --> 00:04:20.399
but the more correct term
for them is vertical angles.

00:04:20.399 --> 00:04:21.712
And we haven't proved it.

00:04:21.712 --> 00:04:23.170
We've just seen a
special case here

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.753
where these vertical
angles are equal.

00:04:24.753 --> 00:04:27.190
But it actually turns out that
vertical angles are always

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:27.820
equal.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:31.240
But we haven't proved it to
ourselves for the general case.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.276
But let me just
write down this word

00:04:33.276 --> 00:04:34.400
since it's a nice new word.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:44.130
So angle CEA and angle
BED are vertical.

00:04:46.762 --> 00:04:49.220
And you might say, wait, they
look like they're horizontal,

00:04:49.220 --> 00:04:50.000
they're next to each other.

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.150
And the vertical
really just means

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:52.649
that they're across
from each other,

00:04:52.649 --> 00:04:54.650
across an intersection
from each other.

00:04:54.650 --> 00:04:58.497
Angle CEB and angle
AED are also vertical.

00:04:58.497 --> 00:04:59.580
So let me write that down.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:08.839
Angle CEB and angle
AED are also vertical.

00:05:08.839 --> 00:05:10.880
And that might even make
a little bit more sense,

00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:13.870
because it literally is, one
is on top and one is on bottom.

00:05:13.870 --> 00:05:16.100
They're kind of vertically
opposite from each other.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.790
But these horizontally
opposite angles

00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.200
are also called vertical angles.

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.309
So now we have one angle left
to figure out, angle AED.

00:05:26.309 --> 00:05:27.850
And based on what
I already told you,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.400
vertical angles tend to be,
or they are always, equal.

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:33.990
But we haven't proven that to
ourselves yet so we can't just

00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:36.930
use that property to say
that this is 110 degrees.

00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:39.950
So what we're going to do
is use the exact same logic.

00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.240
CEA and AED are
clearly supplementary.

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:46.830
Their outsides form
a straight angle.

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:50.880
They're clearly
supplementary, so CEA and AED

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:53.160
must add up to 180 degrees.

00:05:53.160 --> 00:05:57.740
Or we could say the
measure of angle AED

00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:05.790
plus the measure of angle CEA
must be equal to 180 degrees.

00:06:05.790 --> 00:06:10.950
We know the measure
of CEA is 70 degrees.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.010
We know it is 70 degrees.

00:06:13.010 --> 00:06:15.080
So you subtract 70
from both sides.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:21.160
You get the measure of angle
AED is equal to 110 degrees.

00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:24.600
So we got the exact
result that we expected.

00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.720
So this angle right over
here is 110 degrees.

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:30.260
And so if you take any
of the adjacent angles

00:06:30.260 --> 00:06:33.070
that their outer sides
form a straight angle,

00:06:33.070 --> 00:06:34.200
you see they add up to 180.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.890
This one and that
one add up to 180.

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:37.461
This one and that
one add up to 180.

00:06:37.461 --> 00:06:38.960
This one and that
one add up to 180.

00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:41.000
And this one and that
one add up to 180.

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.960
If you go all the way
around the circle,

00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.140
you'll see that they
add up to 360 degrees.

00:06:45.140 --> 00:06:48.630
Because you literally are
going all the way around.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:52.710
So 70 plus 110 is
180, plus 70 is 250,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.366
plus 110 is 360 degrees.

00:06:56.366 --> 00:06:57.240
I'll leave you there.

00:06:57.240 --> 00:06:58.614
This is the first
time that we've

00:06:58.614 --> 00:07:01.600
kind of found some interesting
results using the tool

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:03.165
kit that we've built up so far.

00:07:03.165 --> 00:07:04.540
In the next video,
we'll actually

00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.742
prove to ourselves using pretty
much the exact same logic here,

00:07:07.742 --> 00:07:09.700
but we'll just do it with
generalized numbers--

00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:15.030
we won't use 70
degrees-- to prove

00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:18.720
that the measure of
vertical angles are equal.
