00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:05.900
In the last few videos, we saw
that if we had n points, each

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:07.660
of them have x and
y-coordinates.

00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:09.430
Let me draw n of those points.

00:00:09.430 --> 00:00:11.020
So let's call this point one.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.480
It has coordinates x1, y1.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.290
You have the second
point over here.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.950
It had coordinates x2, y2.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.110
And we keep putting points up
here and eventually we get to

00:00:25.110 --> 00:00:28.050
the nth point.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:31.790
That has coordinates xn, yn.

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:37.350
What we saw is that there is a
line that we can find that

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.465
minimizes the squared
distance.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:45.220
This line right here,
I'll call it y, is

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:49.240
equal to mx plus b.

00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:51.830
There's some line that minimizes
the square distance

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:52.450
to the points.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:55.710
And let me just review what
those squared distances are.

00:00:55.710 --> 00:00:57.690
Sometimes, it's called
the squared error.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.450
So this is the error between
the line and point one.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:02.450
So I'll call that error one.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:06.680
This is the error between
the line and point two.

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:08.520
We'll call this error two.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.990
This is the error between
the line and point n.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:16.920
So if you wanted the total
error, if you want the total

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.290
squared error-- this is actually
how we started off

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:21.880
this whole discussion-- the
total squared error between

00:01:21.880 --> 00:01:28.930
the points and the line, you
literally just take the y

00:01:28.930 --> 00:01:30.040
value each point.

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:32.380
So for example, you
would take y1.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:38.450
That's this value right over
here, you take y1 minus the y

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.050
value at this point
in the line.

00:01:40.050 --> 00:01:43.320
Well, that point in the line is,
essentially, the y value

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:46.700
you get when you substitute
x1 into this equation.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:48.620
So I'll just substitute
x1 into this equation.

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:53.630
So minus m x1 plus b.

00:01:53.630 --> 00:01:57.000
This right here, that is the
this y value right over here.

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.580
That is m x1 b.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.760
I don't want to my get my
graph too cluttered.

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:05.060
So I'll just delete
that there.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.960
That is error one right
over there.

00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:10.970
And we want the squared errors
between each of the

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:11.630
points of the line.

00:02:11.630 --> 00:02:12.880
So that's the first one.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:15.280
Then you do the same thing
for the second point.

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.840
And we started our discussion
this way.

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:24.550
y2 minus m x2 plus b squared,
all the way-- I'll do dot dot

00:02:24.550 --> 00:02:27.320
dot to show that there are a
bunch of these that we have to

00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.510
do until we get to the nth
point-- all the way to yn

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:35.870
minus m xn plus b squared.

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:41.460
And now that we actually know
how to find these m's and b's,

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.280
I showed you the formula.

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:46.050
And in fact, we've proved
the formula.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:47.470
We can find this line.

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:51.010
And if we want to say, well,
how much error is there?

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:52.000
We can then calculate it.

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.800
Because we now know the
m's and the b's.

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.430
So we can calculate it for
certain set of data.

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.460
Now, what I want to do is kind
of come up with a more

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:06.070
meaningful estimate of how good
this line is fitting the

00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.920
data points that we have. And to
do that, we're going to ask

00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:25.290
ourselves the question, what
percentage of the variation in

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:39.690
y is described by the
variation in x?

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:40.750
So let's think about this.

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:43.060
How much of the total variation
in y-- there's

00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:44.540
obviously variation in y.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:46.450
This y value is over here.

00:03:46.450 --> 00:03:47.820
This point's y value
is over here.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.430
There is clearly a bunch
of variation in the y.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:52.680
But how much of that is
essentially described by the

00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:53.450
variation in x?

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:56.750
Or described by the line?

00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:57.690
So let's think about that.

00:03:57.690 --> 00:03:59.510
First, let's think about what
the total variation is.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:04.500
How much of the total
variation in y?

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:06.620
So let's just figure out what
the total variation in y is.

00:04:09.550 --> 00:04:10.880
It's really just a tool
for measuring.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.035
When we think about variation,
and this is even true when we

00:04:17.035 --> 00:04:21.790
thought about variance, which
was the mean variation in y.

00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:24.280
If you think about the squared
distance from some central

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.660
tendency, and the best central
measure we can have of y is

00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.260
the arithmetic mean.

00:04:29.260 --> 00:04:33.120
So we could just say, the total
variation in y is just

00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.440
going to be the sum of the
distances of each of the y's.

00:04:38.440 --> 00:04:54.010
So you get y1 minus the mean
of all the y's squared.

00:04:54.010 --> 00:04:59.880
Plus y2 minus the mean of
all the y's squared.

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:01.850
Plus, and you just keep
going all the way

00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.730
to the nth y value.

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.030
To yn minus the mean of
all the y's squared.

00:05:07.030 --> 00:05:09.350
This gives you the total
variation in y.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.410
You can just take out
all the y values.

00:05:12.410 --> 00:05:13.240
Find their mean.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:14.480
It'll be some value, maybe it's

00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:15.730
right over here someplace.

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:21.680
And so you can even visualize it
the same way we visualized

00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:23.680
the squared error
from the line.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.650
So if you visualize it, you can
imagine a line that's y is

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:29.640
equal to the mean of y.

00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:31.180
Which would look
just like that.

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.080
And what we're measuring over
here, this error right over

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:36.960
here, is the square of this
distance right over here.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:40.850
Between this point vertically
and this line.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:44.430
The second one is going
to be this distance.

00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:45.770
Just right up to the line.

00:05:45.770 --> 00:05:48.620
And the nth one is going to be
the distance from there all

00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.970
the way to the line
right over there.

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:52.430
And there are these other
points in between.

00:05:52.430 --> 00:05:54.430
This is the total
variation in y.

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:55.240
Makes sense.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:06:03.410
If you divide this by n, you're
going to get what we

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:07.310
typically associate as the
variance of y, which is kind

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:08.760
of the average squared
distance.

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.370
Now, we have the total
squared distance.

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:15.615
So what we want to do is-- how
much of the total variation in

00:06:15.615 --> 00:06:19.240
y is described by the
variation in x?

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:20.410
So maybe we can think
of it this way.

00:06:20.410 --> 00:06:22.610
So our denominator, we want what
percentage of the total

00:06:22.610 --> 00:06:23.650
variation in y?

00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:25.030
Let me write it this way.

00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:27.820
Let me call this the squared
error from the average.

00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:35.450
Maybe I'll call this
the squared error

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:39.110
from the mean of y.

00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:41.560
And this is really the
total variation in y.

00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:45.030
So let's put that as
the denominator.

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:48.650
The total variation in y, which
is the squared error

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:53.640
from the mean of the y's.

00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:57.120
Now we want to what percentage
of this is described by the

00:06:57.120 --> 00:06:58.780
variation in x.

00:06:58.780 --> 00:07:01.670
Now, what is not described
by the variation in x?

00:07:01.670 --> 00:07:03.190
We want to how much is
described by the

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:03.880
variation in x.

00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:20.550
But what if we want how much of
the total variation is not

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:29.980
described by the regression
line?

00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:36.030
Well, we already have
a measure for that.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:38.410
We have the squared
error of the line.

00:07:38.410 --> 00:07:41.690
This tells us the square of the
distances from each point

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.550
to our line.

00:07:42.550 --> 00:07:44.450
So it is exactly this measure.

00:07:44.450 --> 00:07:47.480
It tells us how much of the
total variation is not

00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.680
described by the regression
line.

00:07:49.680 --> 00:07:52.160
So if you want to know what
percentage of the total

00:07:52.160 --> 00:08:00.350
variation is not described by
the regression line, it would

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.410
just be the squared error of the
line, because this is the

00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:08.400
total variation not described
by the regression line,

00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:10.790
divided by the total
variation.

00:08:10.790 --> 00:08:13.610
So let me make it clear.

00:08:13.610 --> 00:08:25.890
This, right over here, tells
us what percentage of the

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:34.659
total variation is not
described by the

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:35.909
variation in x.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.070
Or by the regression line.

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:52.040
So to answer our question, what
percentage is described

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:53.140
by the variation?

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:56.130
Well, the rest of it has
to be described by the

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:57.880
variation in x.

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:59.930
Because our question is what
percent of the total variation

00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:01.560
is described by the
variation in x.

00:09:01.560 --> 00:09:03.850
This is the percentage that
is not described.

00:09:03.850 --> 00:09:10.290
So if this number is 30%-- if
30% of the variation in y is

00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.970
not described by the line, then
the remainder will be

00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:15.210
described by the line.

00:09:15.210 --> 00:09:18.240
So we could essentially just
subtract this from 1.

00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:23.390
So if we take 1 minus the
squared error between our data

00:09:23.390 --> 00:09:29.930
points and the line over the
squared error between the y's

00:09:29.930 --> 00:09:38.120
and the mean y, this actually
tells us what percentage of

00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:46.185
total variation is described
by the line.

00:09:46.185 --> 00:09:49.240
You can either view it's
described by the line or by

00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.520
the variation in x.

00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:01.170
And this number right here, this
is called the coefficient

00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:02.420
of determination.

00:10:05.170 --> 00:10:08.120
It's just what statisticians
have decided to name it.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.290
And it's also called
R-squared.

00:10:19.290 --> 00:10:21.960
You might have even heard that
term when people talk about

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:22.770
regression.

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:24.250
Now let's think about it.

00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:33.260
If the squared error of the
line is really small

00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.340
what does that mean?

00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:38.310
It means that these
errors, right over

00:10:38.310 --> 00:10:41.580
here, are really small.

00:10:41.580 --> 00:10:43.850
Which means that the line
is a really good fit.

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.960
So let me write it over here.

00:10:51.960 --> 00:10:57.950
If the squared error of the
line is small, it tells us

00:10:57.950 --> 00:10:59.250
that the line is a good fit.

00:11:05.430 --> 00:11:06.910
Now, what would happen
over here?

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:09.920
Well, if this number is really
small, this is going to be a

00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:12.340
very small fraction over here.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:16.330
1 minus a very small fraction
is going to be a

00:11:16.330 --> 00:11:17.950
number close to 1.

00:11:17.950 --> 00:11:26.980
So then, our R-squared will be
close to 1, which tells us

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:30.640
that a lot of the variation
in y is described by the

00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:31.520
variation in x.

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:34.360
Which makes sense, because
the line is a good fit.

00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.780
You take the opposite case.

00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:43.210
If the squared error of the line
is huge, then that means

00:11:43.210 --> 00:11:46.420
there's a lot of error between
the data points and the line.

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:48.870
So if this number is huge, then
this number over here is

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:51.370
going to be huge.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:53.740
Or it's going to be a percentage
close to 1.

00:11:53.740 --> 00:11:56.410
And 1 minus that is going
to be close to 0.

00:11:56.410 --> 00:12:07.590
And so if the squared error of
the line is large, this whole

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:09.590
thing's going to
be close to 1.

00:12:09.590 --> 00:12:11.510
And if this whole thing is
close to 1, the whole

00:12:11.510 --> 00:12:13.416
coefficient of determination,
the whole R-squared, is going

00:12:13.416 --> 00:12:15.590
to be close to 0, which
makes sense.

00:12:20.600 --> 00:12:23.920
That tells us that very little
of the total variation in y is

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.680
described by the variation in
x, or described by the line.

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.630
Well, anyway, everything I've
been dealing with so far has

00:12:28.630 --> 00:12:29.980
been a little bit
in the abstract.

00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:32.900
In the next video, we'll
actually look at some data

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:35.480
samples and calculate their
regression line.

00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.310
And also calculate the
R-squared, and see how good of

00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.300
a fit it really is.
