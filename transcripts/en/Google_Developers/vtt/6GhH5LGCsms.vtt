00:00:03.375 --> 00:00:06.542
Webb Brown: We started DayZipping
in July of last year.

00:00:06.542 --> 00:00:10.125
And it was really born out of the idea
of I was an investment banker

00:00:10.125 --> 00:00:11.750
and I was working all the time.

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:14.375
And never really knew when I was gonna
have free time on the weekends

00:00:14.375 --> 00:00:16.458
or what city I was gonna be in.

00:00:16.458 --> 00:00:20.250
So it felt like it was really tough
to find stuff real-time

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.208
when I say I have four hours
on a Saturday to spent in Chicago,

00:00:24.208 --> 00:00:26.000
or San Francisco, 
or wherever I might be.

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.792
So, that led to the idea of DayZipping.

00:00:28.792 --> 00:00:31.833
And our site is still relatively small.

00:00:31.833 --> 00:00:33.542
It started in July of last year, 

00:00:33.542 --> 00:00:36.458
but right now we're at around
10, 000 uniques

00:00:36.458 --> 00:00:39.167
and a 100, 000 page views a month.

00:00:39.167 --> 00:00:40.917
Paul Godfrey: Most of our trips
are user-generated.

00:00:40.917 --> 00:00:43.333
And some of our users
had already provided us

00:00:43.333 --> 00:00:46.125
with a great set of trips for San Francisco.

00:00:46.125 --> 00:00:50.250
One thing I wanted to do here
specifically was go visit Alcatraz.

00:00:50.250 --> 00:00:52.792
And that was just a fantastic
write up on that,

00:00:52.792 --> 00:00:54.000
on DayZipping.

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.583
Another thing is hiking in Muir Woods.

00:00:56.583 --> 00:00:59.958
Those are two great trips that we've
been able to take while we're in town,

00:00:59.958 --> 00:01:01.833
thanks to our great users.

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:06.417
So we did a pretty thorough technology
review before we started development.

00:01:06.417 --> 00:01:09.958
We looked at Ruby, Python,
a couple different products.

00:01:09.958 --> 00:01:13.792
But the fundamental choice that
led us to use Google Web Toolkit

00:01:13.792 --> 00:01:16.250
was the performance benefits.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:19.625
Webb Brown: Our site scaled
really well because of using GWT.

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:22.292
Because we have so much
of our business logic

00:01:22.292 --> 00:01:25.167
and the actual code 
being run on the client machine,

00:01:25.167 --> 00:01:27.000
as opposed to our web server.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.917
What it allowed us to do
was iterate really quickly

00:01:29.917 --> 00:01:33.292
and build a lot of different features
and test a lot of different things

00:01:33.292 --> 00:01:37.250
and not spend a lot of time focusing
on optimization and performance.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:41.542
All the inherent benefits of using GWT
took care of that for us.

00:01:41.542 --> 00:01:42.542
So it's been great.

00:01:42.542 --> 00:01:46.583
It's let us build new features
and use stuff like Client Bundling

00:01:46.583 --> 00:01:49.583
and Perfect Caching
and still have a fast site.

00:01:49.583 --> 00:01:51.917
And for us, as a consumer
internet company

00:01:51.917 --> 00:01:54.875
where people are viewing photos
and viewing trips

00:01:54.875 --> 00:01:57.000
and really bouncing around pages a lot,

00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.167
that's probably the most
important factor for us.
