were basically using the equivalent of

00:01:00.349 --> 00:01:00.359
were basically using the equivalent of
 

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:04.310
were basically using the equivalent of
an 18-wheeler truck to move large pieces

00:01:04.310 --> 00:01:04.320
an 18-wheeler truck to move large pieces
 

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.890

that's what these international vehicles

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:15.150
that's what these international vehicles
 

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:16.969
that's what these international vehicles
are and what these commercial vehicles

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
are and what these commercial vehicles
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.130
are and what these commercial vehicles
are that we expect to demonstrate here

00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:19.140
are that we expect to demonstrate here
 

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:29.740
are that we expect to demonstrate here
in the next several months

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:29.750
 

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.929
these last two flights are essentially

00:01:32.929 --> 00:01:32.939
these last two flights are essentially
 

00:01:32.939 --> 00:01:36.020

pre positioning the final spares that we

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:36.030
pre positioning the final spares that we
 

00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:38.270
pre positioning the final spares that we
need to make sure that the vehicle will

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:38.280
need to make sure that the vehicle will
 

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:40.850
need to make sure that the vehicle will
operate safely until commercial

00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:40.860

we have an extremely capable platform

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
we have an extremely capable platform
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:49.490
we have an extremely capable platform
and our view is that we can turn that to

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:49.500
and our view is that we can turn that to
 

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.510
and our view is that we can turn that to
productive uses over the next decade
