letting people choose the sexual
 

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:22.230
letting people choose the sexual
orientation of their children assume

orientation of their children assume
that this will lead to more straight

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.010
that this will lead to more straight
 

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:26.009
that this will lead to more straight
children and fewer gay children I'm not

children and fewer gay children I'm not
 

00:00:26.019 --> 00:00:28.019
children and fewer gay children I'm not
at all convinced this is the case if a

at all convinced this is the case if a
 

00:00:28.029 --> 00:00:29.849
at all convinced this is the case if a
small percentage of people choose to

00:00:29.849 --> 00:00:29.859
small percentage of people choose to
 

00:00:29.859 --> 00:00:32.220
small percentage of people choose to
have straight children because they

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:32.230
have straight children because they
 

00:00:32.230 --> 00:00:34.049
have straight children because they
would otherwise be bigoted or they

00:00:34.049 --> 00:00:34.059
would otherwise be bigoted or they
 

00:00:34.059 --> 00:00:35.610
would otherwise be bigoted or they
otherwise were bigoted and don't want to

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:35.620
otherwise were bigoted and don't want to
 

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:37.770
otherwise were bigoted and don't want to
have gay children but a large percentage

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:37.780
have gay children but a large percentage
 

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:39.119
have gay children but a large percentage
of gay people choose to have gay

00:00:39.119 --> 00:00:39.129
of gay people choose to have gay
 

00:00:39.129 --> 00:00:41.340
of gay people choose to have gay
children and the average likelihood have

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:41.350
children and the average likelihood have
 

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:44.070
children and the average likelihood have
been randomly distorted child being gays

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:44.080
been randomly distorted child being gays
 

00:00:44.080 --> 00:00:45.869
been randomly distorted child being gays
somewhere between 2 and 10 percent on

somewhere between 2 and 10 percent on
the whole the number of gay people will

the whole the number of gay people will
actually increase rather than decrease

actually increase rather than decrease
 

00:00:49.239 --> 00:00:51.299
actually increase rather than decrease
so I think that's a red herring argument

00:00:51.299 --> 00:00:51.309

and Matt to me that suffering is far
 

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:13.800
and Matt to me that suffering is far
more concerning than the possibility

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810
more concerning than the possibility
 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:16.590

environmental component too we simply

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:18.900
environmental component too we simply
 

00:02:18.900 --> 00:02:19.550
environmental component too we simply
don't know yet

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:19.560
don't know yet
 

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.860
don't know yet
I do think over the course of time we

00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:21.870
I do think over the course of time we
 

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:23.180
I do think over the course of time we
will be able to unravel

00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:23.190
will be able to unravel
 

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.309
will be able to unravel
whatever the complex web of causes of

heterosexuality are and once we can do
 

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.170
heterosexuality are and once we can do
that then parents are gonna have to face

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:33.180
that then parents are gonna have to face
 

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:34.850
that then parents are gonna have to face
the choice and they should be able to

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:34.860
the choice and they should be able to
 

00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.470
the choice and they should be able to
make a choice what kinds of child they

00:02:36.470 --> 00:02:36.480
make a choice what kinds of child they
 

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:38.570

this country not many people would do
 

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:48.559
this country not many people would do
that and I think the only limitation on

00:02:48.559 --> 00:02:48.569
that and I think the only limitation on
 

00:02:48.569 --> 00:02:50.600
that and I think the only limitation on
that should be if there is a mass

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:50.610
that should be if there is a mass
 

00:02:50.610 --> 00:02:52.640
that should be if there is a mass
structural dislocation so I can

00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:52.650
structural dislocation so I can
 

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.559
structural dislocation so I can

parents to not might prevent parents for
making the choice because of the fear of

00:02:59.270 --> 00:02:59.280
making the choice because of the fear of
 

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.369
making the choice because of the fear of

cultural concerns should be allowed to
do this I would also add for what it's

00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:09.840
do this I would also add for what it's
 

00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:11.780
do this I would also add for what it's
worth that in cultures where there may

00:03:11.780 --> 00:03:11.790
worth that in cultures where there may
 

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:13.370
worth that in cultures where there may
be people who choose to have male
