1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,150
[inaudible]

2
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,380
joining me today as an activist and
advocate who cofounded the student led gun

3
00:00:08,381 --> 00:00:11,320
control advocacy group.
Never again MSD.

4
00:00:11,560 --> 00:00:15,910
He also helped organize the march for
our lives nationwide student protest

5
00:00:15,911 --> 00:00:18,970
earlier this year. Cameron Caskey
welcome to the Rubin report.

6
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:23,440
Thanks for having me. I'm really happy
that you're here for for many reasons.

7
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:24,580
Uh,

8
00:00:24,580 --> 00:00:28,900
mostly because you strike me suddenly
as someone that's trying to find some

9
00:00:28,901 --> 00:00:32,860
common ground these days and we're gonna
get into that in a whole bunch more.

10
00:00:32,861 --> 00:00:35,020
But uh,
of course I have to mention up top,

11
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:39,130
you are a survivor of the
parkland shooting in Florida. Um,

12
00:00:39,820 --> 00:00:44,080
before we go all into that and everything
that you've been through since,

13
00:00:44,470 --> 00:00:47,530
just tell me a little
bit about life before,

14
00:00:47,531 --> 00:00:52,330
cause I assume you have a life
before and now a new life.

15
00:00:52,910 --> 00:00:53,140
Yes.

16
00:00:53,140 --> 00:00:53,621
Well,
you know,

17
00:00:53,621 --> 00:00:58,540
I spent most of my life as your typical
little shitster who just said whatever

18
00:00:58,541 --> 00:00:59,980
you wanted to have a voice.

19
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:02,350
I was always still convinced that
I was right about everything,

20
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:06,190
whether that was nature and nurture
is kind of up to interpretation,

21
00:01:06,430 --> 00:01:11,430
but I really grew up just dead set
on the fact that I knew everything.

22
00:01:11,800 --> 00:01:16,300
Everything I said was right and I was a
genius. I learned the hard way recently,

23
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:19,780
little too recently that I'm not,
and that was a crazy awakening.

24
00:01:19,781 --> 00:01:23,020
Learning that you don't know everything
in the entire world is actually an

25
00:01:23,021 --> 00:01:24,310
interesting experience.

26
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:27,130
But one of the things that helped
me a lot was doing theater.

27
00:01:27,160 --> 00:01:30,220
I was a big theater kid
because I had this voice.

28
00:01:30,221 --> 00:01:32,800
I always wanted to express
myself. I was, uh, you know,

29
00:01:32,801 --> 00:01:36,400
I was flippantly loud all the time and do,
I didn't know what to do with it.

30
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:40,270
You know, I was knocking doors for
Obama when I was seven. Hmm. Wow. Yeah,

31
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:43,330
I was really interested in, you know,
being active with all that. I mean,

32
00:01:43,331 --> 00:01:46,960
I knew nothing. I thought that John
Mccain was running with Tina Fey,

33
00:01:46,961 --> 00:01:47,794
not Sarah Pailin,

34
00:01:48,160 --> 00:01:51,550
because I had really only seen the
news and I guess I got it mixed up.

35
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:55,570
I was seven. Yeah, I didn't expect
myself to be a policy expert,

36
00:01:55,900 --> 00:01:57,790
but you know, again, I,

37
00:01:57,940 --> 00:02:01,750
I think the point is I was
always really excited to,

38
00:02:01,751 --> 00:02:05,620
to speak and I, and I got involved
with drama and drama. Said, hey,

39
00:02:05,621 --> 00:02:07,390
you have a voice,
here's where to use it.

40
00:02:07,990 --> 00:02:09,850
And you learn a lot of lessons
from doing theater. Have you,

41
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:10,930
have you ever done anything

42
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:13,760
stay back at school?
Not In high school.

43
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:16,670
I did spend 12 years doing
standup comedy in New York City,

44
00:02:16,671 --> 00:02:18,550
which is a whole other nightmare.
But yeah,

45
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:19,910
I um,

46
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,480
I was wanting to do stand up and then I
tried it once when I was seven years old.

47
00:02:23,780 --> 00:02:28,370
I was on a cruise with my family and
there was a kind of adults only nightclub.

48
00:02:28,371 --> 00:02:31,670
It wasn't really, you are able
to get in if you were younger,

49
00:02:31,671 --> 00:02:33,530
but I was the only person
there under maybe 40.

50
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:35,450
And they had an open mic and I kept on,

51
00:02:35,540 --> 00:02:38,390
I kept on raising my hand to get
on and the host was saying, no,

52
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:41,990
what the hell is this kid doing?
And finally he just caved in and was like,

53
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:44,060
all right, let's let the
kid get up here. And,

54
00:02:44,061 --> 00:02:47,780
and I walk up there and I
drop a three minute routine.

55
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,970
I make a joke about my dad's penis. Uh,
which was an interesting experience.

56
00:02:52,971 --> 00:02:57,080
And the thing is, I did not
know that while I was sitting
alone in the front row,

57
00:02:57,081 --> 00:03:01,390
I snuck out of my room, my parents to
the club and I didn't see them. Wow.

58
00:03:01,391 --> 00:03:04,900
So I'm out. I'm out there, I'll say, I'll
send you the kit, the clip privately.

59
00:03:05,230 --> 00:03:09,090
I'm out there and I'm four foot three and,

60
00:03:09,091 --> 00:03:12,280
and everybody's drunk. So they think
I'm a riot. So I think I'm a riot.

61
00:03:12,281 --> 00:03:17,281
And I just kept going and going to the
point where the guy who was running the

62
00:03:17,891 --> 00:03:20,650
open mic was just looming behind
me waiting for me to be done.

63
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:23,920
But I guess he just didn't want to grab
the Mike from a small child without

64
00:03:23,921 --> 00:03:24,940
looking kind of weird.

65
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,190
Stand up is probably best done once at
seven years old and never again to hear

66
00:03:29,191 --> 00:03:30,250
exactly what you're doing.

67
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:33,790
Everybody's had their 15 minutes of fame
when they were seven on a cruise. Yeah.

68
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:36,910
All right. So, so you
were a theater kid. Um,

69
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,420
anything else we should know about?
Just like high school life,

70
00:03:40,421 --> 00:03:45,080
like high school life for sure. A kid
in 2017, 2018 like, what's it like? I'm,

71
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:48,340
I'm not that old, but I ain't
17 anymore. Well, you know, I,

72
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:51,610
high school was really fun for me.
I really enjoyed it on a social level.

73
00:03:51,611 --> 00:03:55,300
I was a shitty student on my
test scores were always good,

74
00:03:55,301 --> 00:03:57,610
but my grades were awful because
they never bothered to do homework.

75
00:03:57,611 --> 00:04:00,520
I thought I was too smart
and cool for that. But, um,

76
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,270
I liked high school a lot because I,

77
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:04,510
I never really subscribed
to one social circle.

78
00:04:04,511 --> 00:04:07,090
I kind of hung out with a lot of people,
you know,

79
00:04:07,091 --> 00:04:10,540
kids who were the stereotypical
popular you kids, you know,

80
00:04:10,541 --> 00:04:12,160
I was just the guy they
knew that was funny.

81
00:04:12,161 --> 00:04:15,940
I would hang out with them sometimes
kids who were that stereotypical nerds,

82
00:04:15,941 --> 00:04:17,950
we would talk about
movies and comic books,

83
00:04:17,951 --> 00:04:21,490
which I want to get into your
comic book collection. Um, and I,

84
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:23,530
I'd say that my core group
was the theater kids.

85
00:04:23,930 --> 00:04:26,430
I love my friends from drama and um,

86
00:04:27,190 --> 00:04:29,710
it's really fun having a
group of friends where you'll,

87
00:04:29,711 --> 00:04:32,560
you'll be hanging out in the weekend
shooting the Shit and then you'll get to

88
00:04:32,561 --> 00:04:37,300
school and either be falling in love with
each other and making out on stage or

89
00:04:37,420 --> 00:04:39,340
killing each other on stage.
You know,

90
00:04:39,341 --> 00:04:42,220
we just did fiddler on the roof and I
got to marry one of my best friends.

91
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:43,960
It was really fun.
I'm sure you're familiar.

92
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:48,910
Fiddler I am familiar with the
lyrics is a classic, so. All right,

93
00:04:48,911 --> 00:04:52,660
so it sounds like a pretty
normal childhood then so far,

94
00:04:53,050 --> 00:04:55,930
I don't think someone like me can
be traded by normal childhood,

95
00:04:56,170 --> 00:04:57,880
but it was a great childhood.
I'm very happy.

96
00:04:57,890 --> 00:05:01,330
My parents divorced when I was 10 and
I'm lucky enough to have four grade

97
00:05:01,331 --> 00:05:05,020
parents. You know, I've got two brothers
and a step sister. It's a great group.

98
00:05:05,070 --> 00:05:08,980
When I'd like to think that I'm a pretty
moral guy and when I'm the shittiest

99
00:05:08,981 --> 00:05:13,390
person in a family, it's a great family.
So you have a standup comic in you.

100
00:05:13,391 --> 00:05:16,180
I can see it. Hopefully it doesn't
come out anytime soon. All right.

101
00:05:16,181 --> 00:05:19,330
So now bring me to that
day shorter this year.

102
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:23,980
So on February 14th, there
was a, it was a regular day.

103
00:05:24,370 --> 00:05:27,340
It was actually a really nice day and
there was a period of time during the day

104
00:05:27,341 --> 00:05:30,700
that I always remember where I thought
that he's going a little too well. Hmm.

105
00:05:31,090 --> 00:05:33,580
I was sitting reading John Walsh's book,
uh,

106
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:37,120
tears of rage I believe if
you're familiar. I don't
remember the title exactly,

107
00:05:37,121 --> 00:05:39,330
but I was a big fan and um,

108
00:05:39,740 --> 00:05:43,610
and I was planning out a Valentine's Day
gift for a girl that I really liked. Uh,

109
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,390
she had, uh, she had an
endoscopy that day and she was,

110
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:49,870
she was on a lot of medicine and I was
going to give her cousins some gifts for

111
00:05:49,871 --> 00:05:52,390
her and have her bring it to her and I
made her a card that said I would have

112
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:56,070
brought you this myself, but I didn't
have the stomach for it dry. I printed a,

113
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:59,840
figured had a picture of her doctor
and put it in the card and everything.

114
00:06:00,290 --> 00:06:04,670
And then I'm, we're in rehearsal for a
musical. We were doing, he'll vikings,

115
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,600
which I'm sure nobody's ever heard
of. I don't know it. And uh, I was,

116
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:12,170
we had just finished up a song and I was
doing, and I realized, wait a second,

117
00:06:12,260 --> 00:06:15,260
I have to go pick up my brother because
that's still my Douglas school lets out

118
00:06:15,261 --> 00:06:15,831
at two 40,

119
00:06:15,831 --> 00:06:19,580
but the special needs kids are out at
two 10 so the parents can pick them up

120
00:06:19,581 --> 00:06:20,480
before the buses come.

121
00:06:21,290 --> 00:06:24,980
And my little brother has autism and
he's hanging out there with all of his

122
00:06:24,981 --> 00:06:27,140
friends and the Ese class.
And by the way,

123
00:06:27,141 --> 00:06:30,950
the autistics seen had Stoneman Douglas
is awesome. Those kids are the best.

124
00:06:31,870 --> 00:06:34,340
And um,
this is a school specialized in that.

125
00:06:34,341 --> 00:06:36,800
Is it like a magnet school
for kids with autism or no,

126
00:06:36,801 --> 00:06:38,780
but it has a great program
with great teachers.

127
00:06:39,170 --> 00:06:42,680
And I actually went back to Parklin this
weekend to see them off to homecoming.

128
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:47,090
And boy, let me tell you that squad as
wild I of them. And um, my little brother,

129
00:06:47,091 --> 00:06:51,400
I don't want to brag, is kind of
the ring leader over there. Um, and,

130
00:06:51,410 --> 00:06:55,280
and I went to go pick them up because on
days like that when my mom was at work,

131
00:06:55,281 --> 00:06:57,050
I would take him to drama
and he would just hang out.

132
00:06:57,051 --> 00:06:59,510
And he really loved it because all
the girls would give them attention.

133
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,490
And you know, he's, he's a bit
of a cocky little bastard. And,

134
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:07,910
um, I realized that it's
maybe to 20, let's say,

135
00:07:08,110 --> 00:07:10,850
and we're halfway through the song and
I say, I forgot to pick up, hold it.

136
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,820
So we finished the song and I asked my
teacher if I could go run and pick them

137
00:07:13,821 --> 00:07:15,230
up.
Of course she said yes,

138
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,430
and I'm picking up Holden and
suddenly there's a fire alarm. And I,

139
00:07:20,510 --> 00:07:23,660
and that was a little scary because we
were close to pick up and I was with the

140
00:07:23,661 --> 00:07:27,200
special needs kids. Some of them were in
wheelchairs, some of whom were not, were,

141
00:07:27,290 --> 00:07:29,180
you know,
a little physically disabled.

142
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:34,640
And we had to go to the parking lot where
the buses would come. And I said, oh no,

143
00:07:34,670 --> 00:07:35,503
what if this,

144
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,260
what if this is a real fire and I have
to sit out here and make sure that nobody

145
00:07:39,261 --> 00:07:41,870
gets hit by a bus. There were teachers
there of course, but you know,

146
00:07:42,350 --> 00:07:43,161
it's a public school.

147
00:07:43,161 --> 00:07:48,161
There maybe two teachers for 10 15
students who won't need a lot of help.

148
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,340
Sure.

149
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:52,790
So we're out there sitting in the parking
lot and were there were students out

150
00:07:52,791 --> 00:07:56,120
there from other classes nearby who
uh, cause again, this is a fire drill.

151
00:07:56,570 --> 00:08:00,380
There were students out there who
were with us and it was the Ese class.

152
00:08:00,381 --> 00:08:01,700
It was a couple of the nearby classes.

153
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:05,660
And one of the kids jokingly
said as a shooter, I said, Dude,

154
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:10,310
shut the fuck up. That's not cool because
how could that ever happen? Right.

155
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,560
And suddenly I see everybody running
back and side and the teacher says get

156
00:08:15,561 --> 00:08:19,280
inside, get inside. And I said,
oh, okay. It wasn't a real fire.

157
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:21,770
And they want to get all the kids
inside before the buses come.

158
00:08:22,820 --> 00:08:26,630
And then we're told to go in
a room and were told to hide,

159
00:08:26,631 --> 00:08:29,360
get away from the window and turn
the lights off. And I say, okay,

160
00:08:29,361 --> 00:08:32,630
something's going on.
And that experience was,

161
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:35,540
was an interesting one because I was in
the leadership room with a lot of the

162
00:08:35,541 --> 00:08:36,321
leadership students,

163
00:08:36,321 --> 00:08:40,940
which is a class that specializes
in leadership and they plan prom and

164
00:08:40,941 --> 00:08:42,770
everything sort of student government.

165
00:08:43,220 --> 00:08:46,700
And it was also the special needs kids
because it was the nearest room and some

166
00:08:46,701 --> 00:08:49,970
of the students being nonverbal.
Does that mean you can't make noise?

167
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:53,000
And some of the students
were yelling and wailing.

168
00:08:53,060 --> 00:08:56,160
Fortunately they had shadows and the
special needs teachers at Douglas are

169
00:08:56,161 --> 00:08:58,620
fantastic and we're able
to keep everybody calm,

170
00:08:58,621 --> 00:09:00,450
but we didn't know what was going on.

171
00:09:01,020 --> 00:09:04,950
And we were there for a couple hours
and slowly more details begin to emerge.

172
00:09:04,951 --> 00:09:09,810
And I assume you're hearing gunfire
and no, no. Douglas is a huge school.

173
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:14,160
And I wasn't. Now mind you, I thought
I heard gunfire, but when you're told,

174
00:09:14,161 --> 00:09:16,260
being told you're school is getting
shot up and you hear anything,

175
00:09:16,261 --> 00:09:19,980
you might think it's gunfire. Yeah,
but I'm sitting there holding,

176
00:09:19,981 --> 00:09:23,130
my little brother has no
idea what's going on and,

177
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:25,770
and slowly I realized,
okay,

178
00:09:26,280 --> 00:09:29,850
there's a shooting I heard and people
were whispering around the room.

179
00:09:29,851 --> 00:09:32,820
It was maybe 20 kids in the room,
people saying 50 people are dead,

180
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:37,230
two people are dead. One
person, his dad, Eh, eh.

181
00:09:37,350 --> 00:09:41,060
There were conflicting stories. I heard
conflicting stories of who was the chef,

182
00:09:41,130 --> 00:09:43,800
who the shooter was.
I heard five different names,

183
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,330
one of whom was somebody I knew.

184
00:09:45,570 --> 00:09:50,280
Somebody I knew would not pick up a
weapon to harm of butterfly because that's

185
00:09:50,281 --> 00:09:53,100
hysteria and that and that's
natural and I understand it.

186
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:58,140
Then I saw something that was a terrible
exhibit of humanity. If you ask me,

187
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:02,520
which was there was a snapchat video going
around that was that with the caption

188
00:10:02,521 --> 00:10:07,470
Yo with multiple owes my school getting
shot up and it was a video of a dead

189
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:11,000
teacher. Look, if you're going to film as,

190
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:14,490
as shooting from inside a room so you
can have evidence to show the police,

191
00:10:15,240 --> 00:10:18,840
good on you. If you're going to
fill my shooting in a room and say,

192
00:10:18,841 --> 00:10:21,840
Yo my school getting shot up and
send it to everybody, you know,

193
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:23,790
that's pretty awesome.
Yeah.

194
00:10:23,791 --> 00:10:27,480
And when you're sitting there in a room
not knowing what's going on and you see

195
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:30,870
videos of people you know
and love deceased and the,

196
00:10:30,871 --> 00:10:32,850
and the only video I saw was,
or somebody who had,

197
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:35,700
I had cared about for many years,
he was a mentor in my life.

198
00:10:36,540 --> 00:10:41,240
You start to realize that nothing is ever
going to be the same again. Yeah. Yeah.

199
00:10:41,530 --> 00:10:41,881
Wait,

200
00:10:41,881 --> 00:10:44,970
let's pause for one sec cause that we
shouldn't gloss over that part where the

201
00:10:44,971 --> 00:10:49,110
social media component of this is so
important because you guys all grew up on

202
00:10:49,111 --> 00:10:51,810
this and then you grow up hearing
about school shootings all the time.

203
00:10:52,200 --> 00:10:54,660
And I could see, I don't know who
this kid is. It doesn't matter.

204
00:10:54,661 --> 00:10:59,550
I'm sure I'm periods perfectly fine person
or he or she. But it's like, you know,

205
00:10:59,551 --> 00:11:01,920
doing that, it's like, it
just, it almost feels like,

206
00:11:01,921 --> 00:11:03,270
oh that's the normal thing to do.

207
00:11:03,271 --> 00:11:07,010
Like there's a shooting like
[inaudible] on snapchat, you know,

208
00:11:07,020 --> 00:11:08,510
several people I knew were
just treating it. Yeah.

209
00:11:08,530 --> 00:11:11,530
Like it was normal. I mean
not the shooting, but the
fact that there was a video.

210
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:16,690
And so I understand how some people
might like to not like, but you know,

211
00:11:16,691 --> 00:11:20,440
understand having to see that because
they need to understand what's going on.

212
00:11:20,710 --> 00:11:23,680
But I saw it and I said,
how could you do that?

213
00:11:24,460 --> 00:11:27,310
This is somebody who is deceased
and you're filming them to show,

214
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:28,780
to send it to all your friends.

215
00:11:29,020 --> 00:11:32,590
And that's a reflection of
the social media era we're in,

216
00:11:32,860 --> 00:11:35,530
where everything that's going on,
you got to show everyone.

217
00:11:35,700 --> 00:11:37,800
So for how long were you
actually in that room?

218
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:41,760
Not knowing if you were going to be okay,
not knowing what was happening.

219
00:11:41,910 --> 00:11:45,480
I think it was about two hours.
Um, I could look at interviews.

220
00:11:45,481 --> 00:11:48,700
I did days after and have a much
better gauge. I forget. Yeah.

221
00:11:48,750 --> 00:11:50,460
But I would call it around two hours.

222
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:53,380
And you know when the Swat
team broke the door down,

223
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,340
there was the big issue that there are
students who are developmentally disabled

224
00:11:57,341 --> 00:11:59,440
in here who might not be
able to put their hands up.

225
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:03,280
And fortunately one of the only good
things you'll see from Broward [inaudible]

226
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:07,450
handling of the shooting was the swat
team was very understanding and was very

227
00:12:07,451 --> 00:12:10,980
quick to help these students, which
was good. But when that glass broken,

228
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:14,110
the first thing that walked
into a room was a was a rifle.

229
00:12:15,280 --> 00:12:20,050
How are we supposed to know that?
That wasn't us taking our term but and I,

230
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,880
everybody was texting their parents.

231
00:12:22,330 --> 00:12:25,750
Everybody at the phone lines were kind
of jammed cause everybody in Parkland was

232
00:12:25,751 --> 00:12:28,960
making a call. I mean it was
Parkland. It was a city with,

233
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:30,580
I don't even know how many people,

234
00:12:30,581 --> 00:12:34,240
but it's small town where
there's one high school.

235
00:12:34,840 --> 00:12:35,673
Is there one high school?

236
00:12:36,500 --> 00:12:41,110
There's just around
one high school and we,

237
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:44,530
I mean nobody should be equipped
for this, but we weren't. Yeah.

238
00:12:44,740 --> 00:12:47,560
Had you guys been taught at all?
Like are they teaching in high school?

239
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:51,250
Like what to do if this actually
does happen. If a shooter sure.

240
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:54,010
Comes through school. We had the
discussion of having a code red drill.

241
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,370
We had had long discussions
about dealing with a shooter,

242
00:12:57,371 --> 00:12:59,560
but we had never participated
in and code red drill.

243
00:12:59,950 --> 00:13:03,480
I at least not while I was at school.
I used to skip school a lot. Yeah.

244
00:13:03,670 --> 00:13:06,580
Tell me a little bit more
about the makeup of Parkland.

245
00:13:06,590 --> 00:13:09,340
Cause you mentioned something interesting
that it's kind of like a little

246
00:13:09,341 --> 00:13:12,220
liberal [inaudible] Markland
at a pretty liberal area.

247
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:16,600
It's not homogeneous when it
comes to being liberal. You know,

248
00:13:16,601 --> 00:13:17,980
there's a lot of different perspectives,

249
00:13:17,981 --> 00:13:21,940
but the majority of people in Parkland
are pretty liberal and pretty classic

250
00:13:21,941 --> 00:13:23,680
liberal.
And um,

251
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:26,780
and that's why you'll see a lot of
the activism to come out of Stoneman.

252
00:13:26,790 --> 00:13:31,420
Douglas was less, you know,
let's, let's, I don't know,

253
00:13:31,690 --> 00:13:34,510
it was very gun control
related. Yeah. So let's, we'll,

254
00:13:34,511 --> 00:13:37,810
we'll get to that in a little bit because
obviously so much has happened in the

255
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:41,300
spotlight that has been put on
you guys and everything else and,

256
00:13:41,301 --> 00:13:43,990
and several of you have stepped into it.
And I think there's,

257
00:13:44,020 --> 00:13:46,300
there's probably good parts
of that in bad parts of that.

258
00:13:46,301 --> 00:13:49,840
I think that's probably why you're here
right now. Double edged sword. Yeah. Um,

259
00:13:49,870 --> 00:13:54,790
okay. So it ends now what are,
you know, they tell you all right.

260
00:13:54,791 --> 00:13:57,940
You can walk out of this room. I mean
sure. I can't imagine. So we ran,

261
00:13:58,390 --> 00:14:03,160
we ran with our hands up. We
sat outside for a bit. Um,

262
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:08,190
I was able to go on a city bus with my
little brother's class to the Marriott,

263
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,470
which is the hotel,
the only hotel in Parkland.

264
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:14,230
And so they weren't letting parents come.

265
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,510
No parents were coming to
pick us up at the hotel.

266
00:14:16,870 --> 00:14:19,180
But there were a lot of different
ways students got out of the school,

267
00:14:19,181 --> 00:14:23,450
a lot of different places. They
went, some kids I know just ran. Um,

268
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:27,640
which is understandable. Normally when
there's a mass shooting nearby you run.

269
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:29,553
And,
um,

270
00:14:29,920 --> 00:14:33,760
my brother and I were at the Marriott
Hotel and our father picked us up,

271
00:14:33,820 --> 00:14:36,850
took us over an hour to get home
because as I'm sure you can understand,

272
00:14:36,851 --> 00:14:39,520
the streets were very jammed.
I mean after the shooting,

273
00:14:39,521 --> 00:14:41,740
Parkland was a no man's land.
It,

274
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:45,160
this wasn't mad max anarchy where
everybody was wearing leather spikes,

275
00:14:45,730 --> 00:14:47,720
but it was a no man's land.
There was,

276
00:14:47,980 --> 00:14:52,980
it was as if time and space had been
the rules of physics and matter didn't

277
00:14:55,131 --> 00:14:59,990
really exist. It was
eerie. It was seven days,

278
00:14:59,991 --> 00:15:00,920
at least for me.

279
00:15:00,921 --> 00:15:05,921
That was when that period of really
surreal fear with existed that,

280
00:15:07,990 --> 00:15:12,860
that nothing felt real. And um,
then they can't, news was there,

281
00:15:12,861 --> 00:15:16,010
there wasn't the most we got was somebody
at the sunset and we'll talking about

282
00:15:16,011 --> 00:15:18,760
our production of fiddler
on the roof. The, um,

283
00:15:19,280 --> 00:15:23,510
did you in that period, and I'm sure it's
very hard to even remember it clearly.

284
00:15:23,950 --> 00:15:28,580
Did you have a real chance
to mourn, to figure out what
happened? Um, I don't know.

285
00:15:28,581 --> 00:15:31,460
You can maybe let me know how close
you were to maybe some of the students

286
00:15:31,850 --> 00:15:32,720
because it seems like,

287
00:15:32,721 --> 00:15:36,410
and I think this was part of the problem
with the way we deal with these things,

288
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:41,480
is that we go from the incident to
immediately a special on social media just

289
00:15:41,481 --> 00:15:43,220
attacking each other and
destroying each other.

290
00:15:43,460 --> 00:15:46,520
Then you guys all get thrust into
the spotlight and it's like, Whoa,

291
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:51,410
this would be hard on, on an adult,
you know, impossibly hard. Meanwhile,

292
00:15:51,411 --> 00:15:54,470
you have these kids who are now out
there talking about these things.

293
00:15:54,471 --> 00:15:55,790
These kids need to mourn.

294
00:15:56,060 --> 00:15:59,580
I mean need to figure out what's going
on with life and find some reality in

295
00:15:59,581 --> 00:16:01,070
decency.
So I,

296
00:16:01,280 --> 00:16:05,990
I think that there's really no formula
for recovering for from a mass shooting,

297
00:16:05,991 --> 00:16:08,030
especially when at a school,
I mean,

298
00:16:08,090 --> 00:16:11,360
enough of happened that they're
starting to develop a precedence,

299
00:16:11,361 --> 00:16:15,710
which is a horrible thing, but there's
really nowhere to look. You can,

300
00:16:16,280 --> 00:16:17,390
I could have hidden away,

301
00:16:17,391 --> 00:16:20,570
I could have locked myself in my room
for weeks and maybe that would have been

302
00:16:20,571 --> 00:16:24,440
the right thing to do. I could
have. I didn't know what to do.

303
00:16:24,590 --> 00:16:27,380
And my way of coping has
always been doing something.

304
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:31,720
I had dealt with some tragic loss
this past year and I had the,

305
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:34,910
there were some really dark things
that happened to people that I loved.

306
00:16:35,390 --> 00:16:37,880
And the way I always handled
them was by doing something.

307
00:16:37,881 --> 00:16:40,700
I never liked to have a
clear head because, well,

308
00:16:40,701 --> 00:16:43,040
I think it's important to process
your pain and deal with it.

309
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:47,840
I also think that the, if I, if something
like that happens and I do nothing,

310
00:16:48,290 --> 00:16:51,620
I'm never going to forget myself.
I had survivor guilt. Why?

311
00:16:51,621 --> 00:16:52,850
Why should I have left that day?

312
00:16:53,420 --> 00:16:57,260
There were 15 year old girls that
were murdered and I made it out.

313
00:16:57,410 --> 00:17:00,320
And if I could have pressed a
button to trade my life for theirs,

314
00:17:00,350 --> 00:17:04,070
it wouldn't have even been, hmm. Well
maybe I should say goodbye to people.

315
00:17:04,071 --> 00:17:05,180
Maybe I should think about this.
No,

316
00:17:05,181 --> 00:17:07,700
I would have broken my
finger pressing it too hard.

317
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,590
So what made me deserve life when
other people who did nothing wrong.

318
00:17:12,650 --> 00:17:16,490
If people more innocent, more kind
than I am, didn't get to make it out.

319
00:17:17,210 --> 00:17:19,900
And I realized while I'm alive and,

320
00:17:19,940 --> 00:17:23,990
and one of my mentors wasn't Scott Eagle
and one of the nicest guys I've ever

321
00:17:23,991 --> 00:17:28,190
met. He's the reason that I'm a snarky
little asshole. I developed that from him.

322
00:17:28,340 --> 00:17:29,173
Um,

323
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:33,200
he didn't make it out there and he's
somebody who changed young people's lives

324
00:17:33,201 --> 00:17:36,980
by making them better and making
them more proud of themselves. So,

325
00:17:36,981 --> 00:17:41,060
so what makes me, what has
me deserving of this? No,

326
00:17:41,150 --> 00:17:44,480
I'm not a very religious or
spiritual person, so I don't,

327
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:47,120
I didn't think there was some great
plan that got me out of school,

328
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:52,620
but I think that I had a responsibility
at a responsibility to do right by the

329
00:17:52,621 --> 00:17:55,590
people we lost and to do what I thought
would make the world a better place

330
00:17:55,591 --> 00:17:58,830
while they can't, because there
were marriages that didn't happen.

331
00:17:58,830 --> 00:18:01,280
There were people who
would have had children and

332
00:18:03,070 --> 00:18:06,600
the didn't get, I don't know,
it's a horrible thing to think.

333
00:18:06,601 --> 00:18:11,130
But at the end of the day, uh,
lives ended and I still had mine.

334
00:18:11,460 --> 00:18:15,690
So I said after the shooting when
I'm going to do is something,

335
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,520
and I, I was uh, you know,

336
00:18:17,521 --> 00:18:21,420
I've been a big liberal most of my life
and I s and I've always been an advocate

337
00:18:21,421 --> 00:18:22,254
for gun control.

338
00:18:22,410 --> 00:18:26,850
I was a big debater of other students
after the shooting in Las Vegas where I

339
00:18:26,851 --> 00:18:29,150
said nobody needs these were,

340
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:32,670
we're in a point in our society where
we're advanced enough that nobody needs an

341
00:18:32,671 --> 00:18:35,220
assault weapon to take care of themselves.
Look at the,

342
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:37,890
look at the way these guns are made.

343
00:18:37,891 --> 00:18:41,280
We can defend ourselves at handguns and
my father has multiple in the house.

344
00:18:41,281 --> 00:18:45,300
He's a reserve police officer. He was
Miami shores for awhile. I didn't,

345
00:18:45,370 --> 00:18:47,640
I instantly said the thing we can do here,

346
00:18:47,870 --> 00:18:50,970
let's stop folks like the shooter at
my school from getting these weapons

347
00:18:51,450 --> 00:18:55,090
because this is a 19 year old who
if he had spent five minutes with a

348
00:18:55,091 --> 00:18:58,920
psychologist would have been sent
to a therapist and not a gun store.

349
00:18:59,000 --> 00:19:03,260
Yeah. Okay. So let's, before
we get specifically to far
down the, the gun road here,

350
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:07,100
which obviously we're going to touch
on. Okay. You guys are trying to mourn,

351
00:19:07,610 --> 00:19:09,020
you know,
you're having survivor guilt,

352
00:19:09,021 --> 00:19:12,680
all of these things I'm sure just in your
family and your brother and everything

353
00:19:12,681 --> 00:19:17,060
else. Just, I can't even imagine then
the media because I think this is,

354
00:19:17,061 --> 00:19:21,050
we have to hit media stuff before we
get to the gun. The media then descend.

355
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:22,880
What was that like?
I mean,

356
00:19:22,881 --> 00:19:27,050
I assume everybody and their brother was
trying to reach out to all of you guys.

357
00:19:27,051 --> 00:19:31,100
They were putting you guys on TV. I
mean, I probably even that very day.

358
00:19:31,490 --> 00:19:35,450
Um, what was that like
for you guys or for you?

359
00:19:35,900 --> 00:19:38,530
I, you know, the whole, our
whole situation with the media,

360
00:19:38,531 --> 00:19:43,510
whether it be anything from CNN to Fox
News to Ellen was a double edged sword

361
00:19:44,020 --> 00:19:45,730
because on the one,
on the one hand,

362
00:19:46,100 --> 00:19:48,670
there are bodies that are
warm and right here on TV.

363
00:19:49,270 --> 00:19:52,540
And in retrospect I might have done
that differently. I'm not sure.

364
00:19:52,990 --> 00:19:57,130
On the other hand, I couldn't let
this be like Sandy Hook for example.

365
00:19:57,290 --> 00:20:01,510
I couldn't let this be people coming in
to film crying mothers talking about how

366
00:20:01,511 --> 00:20:06,010
bad these guns are and leave. I wanted
to get out there and say, no, okay, this,

367
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:09,880
how many of these do we need
before we do some that I don't,

368
00:20:09,881 --> 00:20:13,660
I didn't want people to see Parkland as
a place where everybody was crying and

369
00:20:13,661 --> 00:20:14,920
everybody was throwing a pity party.

370
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:18,460
I wanted to people to see Parkland as a
place where a terrible tragedy happened

371
00:20:18,700 --> 00:20:20,290
and this city is stood up and said,
no,

372
00:20:21,010 --> 00:20:23,860
we're not going to be like these other
places. We are going to be a catalyst.

373
00:20:24,040 --> 00:20:27,340
I mean, before, before
Stoneman Douglas, I would send,

374
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:31,180
I would hear the word sandy hook in a
room and everybody would get quiet and it

375
00:20:31,181 --> 00:20:34,780
would be weird. I couldn't have
that be Stoneman Douglas this place.

376
00:20:34,781 --> 00:20:38,170
That was my school. I loved my school.
I was a big school spirit fellow.

377
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:40,270
It was about to become a statistic.

378
00:20:40,271 --> 00:20:44,290
It was about to become that one dark
thing that somebody will make a joke about

379
00:20:44,590 --> 00:20:47,860
or somebody will say something
bad about or really anything.

380
00:20:48,370 --> 00:20:52,810
So I got out there and said, no. And
so many people got out there and said,

381
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:57,140
this cannot be another
example of everybody. Luton.

382
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,100
Everybody crying. Yeah.
We're not here to cry.

383
00:21:00,101 --> 00:21:02,350
We're here to tell you what we can
do to make this a better world.

384
00:21:02,470 --> 00:21:06,520
Were there people, I assume
parents, advisors, whoever,

385
00:21:06,521 --> 00:21:09,430
that were kind of guiding you
through the media part of this?

386
00:21:09,431 --> 00:21:13,790
Because there were so many strange moments
where it seemed like, okay, I said,

387
00:21:13,791 --> 00:21:16,780
do you right before, I don't want to
make this about any specific student,

388
00:21:16,781 --> 00:21:18,610
especially in, I don't want to
throw anyone out on the bus.

389
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:23,020
But when we'd see someone like David Hogg
who obviously is very public now, uh,

390
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,300
you know, saying things that
didn't quite seem right or,

391
00:21:27,301 --> 00:21:29,080
or talking about laws and all this stuff,

392
00:21:29,081 --> 00:21:34,081
like going from just surviving to
suddenly advocacy with almost no space in

393
00:21:35,231 --> 00:21:36,600
between. Uh, you know,

394
00:21:36,870 --> 00:21:36,961
well,

395
00:21:36,961 --> 00:21:40,320
I think the general idea is I think the
general idea of going right to advocacy,

396
00:21:40,321 --> 00:21:44,070
while it might not have been our best
call to immediately go to it was these

397
00:21:44,071 --> 00:21:47,080
cameras are only here for so long
and we couldn't have them leave.

398
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:49,800
There's that double edged
sword. Exactly. Yeah. So do we,

399
00:21:49,950 --> 00:21:54,180
do we wait our respectful time and then
go out and advocate or what people not

400
00:21:54,181 --> 00:21:58,590
care. And I think I stand by advocacy.

401
00:21:59,070 --> 00:22:02,940
I'm not sure. I think on a moral
level I might not, but on a,

402
00:22:03,210 --> 00:22:08,070
but generally I think that while everybody
was looking we had to say, let's,

403
00:22:08,130 --> 00:22:10,800
let's look at what we really
want to look at here. Yeah.

404
00:22:11,180 --> 00:22:14,220
These are like give these
families their space.

405
00:22:14,290 --> 00:22:17,630
Were, were any of you guys afraid that
you were being looked at as experts?

406
00:22:17,631 --> 00:22:21,740
Suddenly where as horrific as what
happened to you was it doesn't make you an

407
00:22:21,741 --> 00:22:24,650
expert either in law or in
guns or any of those things.

408
00:22:24,651 --> 00:22:28,400
Like you can very eloquently as you're
doing right now, tell me your story.

409
00:22:28,401 --> 00:22:31,340
Tell me what you think. All of those
things. But especially at the beginning,

410
00:22:31,341 --> 00:22:34,580
I'm sure you know way more now.
You don't know everything.

411
00:22:34,581 --> 00:22:35,570
Nobody knows everything.

412
00:22:35,571 --> 00:22:39,560
And they were throwing a bunch of 17 year
olds out there as if they were experts

413
00:22:39,561 --> 00:22:42,320
on all of these things. And I think
that also added to some of the,

414
00:22:42,890 --> 00:22:44,180
the tumbled around everything.

415
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:48,740
Well at the time it was awesome.
Yeah. I mean, I was an expert. I felt,

416
00:22:48,770 --> 00:22:52,340
I felt phenomenal. I was somebody
that everybody was looking to as if I,

417
00:22:52,940 --> 00:22:57,190
as if I knew everything. And as I said
before, that was what I wanted. Yeah. And,

418
00:22:57,260 --> 00:23:00,140
and it wasn't a good feeling.
I, I'll be honest with you,

419
00:23:00,141 --> 00:23:04,140
some things about it felt good and
most of it felt like a terrible,

420
00:23:04,270 --> 00:23:06,880
interesting. You just said it's
awesome and it wasn't a good feeling.

421
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:08,380
That's probably sums it up,
I guess.

422
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:12,620
Yeah,
it was awesome to me that I got to the,

423
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:16,780
I spent my whole life watching people
talk about laws and watching people talk

424
00:23:16,781 --> 00:23:20,770
about politics. And now I got to say
this and my word got to be respected,

425
00:23:20,771 --> 00:23:25,640
but every time I went out there I
thought there are people dead. And it's,

426
00:23:25,770 --> 00:23:29,680
it's just, it's a, it's a, it's
a moral qualm. Am I out here at,

427
00:23:29,740 --> 00:23:32,740
I'm doing this because I believe in it
and I'm doing this because I don't want

428
00:23:32,741 --> 00:23:37,330
the world to lose people again, nobody
deserves to be shot. Nobody at all.

429
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:42,790
Nobody who's a good person
deserves to be shot. So,

430
00:23:44,510 --> 00:23:47,630
so I, it was, it was difficult
for me because on the one hand,

431
00:23:47,631 --> 00:23:51,590
it was this amazing feeling of,
here's my voice.

432
00:23:51,710 --> 00:23:54,770
Everybody's listening.
Let me tell you what you all need to hear.

433
00:23:54,771 --> 00:23:58,250
And what everybody need to hear was we
need to pass gun laws. It's been enough.

434
00:23:58,740 --> 00:24:01,010
If people did nothing after Columbine,

435
00:24:01,011 --> 00:24:03,650
I would have understood because
that was supposed to be an anomaly.

436
00:24:03,770 --> 00:24:06,260
I'm sure you remembered.
That was of course a shocker.

437
00:24:06,261 --> 00:24:10,100
And then Stoneman Douglas happened and
it was more of an another, not a woe.

438
00:24:10,940 --> 00:24:15,680
So, so it felt, it felt great
that people were carrying,

439
00:24:16,010 --> 00:24:16,431
that was the,

440
00:24:16,431 --> 00:24:19,250
that was what I would say it was the
awesome part was that I was afraid

441
00:24:19,251 --> 00:24:20,084
everybody would,

442
00:24:20,300 --> 00:24:23,630
everybody in the country would
feel helpless and cry and be done.

443
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:26,750
But it was amazing to see
that the country was saying,

444
00:24:26,751 --> 00:24:29,960
maybe there's something we can do here,
maybe we can make some change.

445
00:24:30,890 --> 00:24:35,630
And the thing that was awful was I was,
I was going from news hits to,

446
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,190
to memorial services.

447
00:24:37,290 --> 00:24:40,490
Yeah. So you've had a sort of
interesting evolution about all this and,

448
00:24:40,610 --> 00:24:43,560
and it sort of leads to where we're going
to end, which is what you're doing now,

449
00:24:43,561 --> 00:24:48,120
which is pretty awesome. Um, so
all right, you're part of the,

450
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:49,890
now you're part of the media machine.

451
00:24:50,160 --> 00:24:52,530
You guys are trying to
figure out what can you do?

452
00:24:52,560 --> 00:24:56,190
I assume that's sort of how march for
our life started and if I'm not mistaken,

453
00:24:56,191 --> 00:24:57,020
it started doing here.

454
00:24:57,020 --> 00:24:59,470
That's right. Start it in
my bathroom. Yeah, I was um,

455
00:24:59,530 --> 00:25:02,770
I was coming out of the showers and
putting on my Ghostbusters Pj's,

456
00:25:02,771 --> 00:25:06,650
it was a slimer. It wasn't
old school. Ghostbusters. Yes,
of course. Of course. Right.

457
00:25:06,940 --> 00:25:10,510
I um, we could talk about the new
Ghostbusters maybe after this part.

458
00:25:11,320 --> 00:25:15,820
How much hate do you want to get online?
I look,

459
00:25:15,821 --> 00:25:18,130
I'll tell you this, everybody in
that cast is incredibly talented.

460
00:25:18,730 --> 00:25:20,200
I didn't like the movie very much,

461
00:25:20,201 --> 00:25:23,290
but there's really nobody who
is in it that I think was not,

462
00:25:23,770 --> 00:25:27,890
is not an incredibly funny person.
But anyway, I, I'm excited.

463
00:25:27,900 --> 00:25:30,910
One of my home and I got a lot
of my friends together. Some,

464
00:25:31,210 --> 00:25:36,210
I called everyone who I knew
was intelligent and well
spoken and was willing to

465
00:25:37,781 --> 00:25:41,770
put their time to grieve aside to
demand action because it's, you know,

466
00:25:41,800 --> 00:25:45,730
I felt like it was in some ways public
service because people are grieving and

467
00:25:45,731 --> 00:25:49,180
we're out here saying,
we're gonna put that aside as,

468
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:52,300
as much as I wanted to cry every day
and mind you, I really want to do.

469
00:25:52,300 --> 00:25:57,220
And I did a lot. I knew that I had to
put that aside. I had to do something.

470
00:25:57,520 --> 00:26:01,420
So I got everybody that I knew could
do something to mostly my drama friends

471
00:26:01,450 --> 00:26:04,660
cause I knew that they could speak and
we all got together at my house and said,

472
00:26:04,661 --> 00:26:07,150
well,
what do we do with this whole,

473
00:26:07,210 --> 00:26:11,590
this whole country people on both
sides or all morning together?

474
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:15,790
How can we get everybody on both sides
together to do something? Now mind you,

475
00:26:15,791 --> 00:26:19,890
that didn't happen. Getting people on
both sides didn't really happen. Yeah. Um,

476
00:26:19,960 --> 00:26:21,790
that can be a tough one.
It's,

477
00:26:21,791 --> 00:26:24,310
and it is a tough one and then
it will always be a tough one,

478
00:26:24,311 --> 00:26:29,290
but it's something that needs
to be done. And, and you know,

479
00:26:29,291 --> 00:26:32,620
from, from my home, we were
sleeping two hours a night.

480
00:26:32,890 --> 00:26:37,180
I would go entire days only eating one
protein bar, not even realizing we were.

481
00:26:37,180 --> 00:26:41,080
So it was such a tornado that we were all,

482
00:26:41,410 --> 00:26:44,130
we all kind of forgot what it
was like to a normal person.

483
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:48,390
So you come up with the idea
for March for our lives,

484
00:26:48,420 --> 00:26:51,060
now get us to that day.

485
00:26:51,090 --> 00:26:54,120
And what was it supposed to be?
What,

486
00:26:54,140 --> 00:26:58,140
what were the actual original intentions
beyond, let's not forget about this.

487
00:26:58,650 --> 00:27:03,650
Original intentions were let's get gun
control passed and I'm still a big,

488
00:27:03,810 --> 00:27:06,930
let's get gun control past guy.
And um,

489
00:27:07,770 --> 00:27:10,980
and that's what we wanted to do.
We want to say everybody out here saying,

490
00:27:10,981 --> 00:27:13,380
we should do this. Let's get
everyone together. Let's,

491
00:27:13,381 --> 00:27:17,610
let's get a big march
together where people say,

492
00:27:18,030 --> 00:27:19,920
I want,
I'm coming all the way out here.

493
00:27:20,400 --> 00:27:24,460
I'm standing out here
today to demand this. And,

494
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:28,610
and seeing everybody together
was amazing. I, um, you get it.

495
00:27:28,611 --> 00:27:31,050
Getting up on the stage and
seeing all those people,

496
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:36,070
I didn't care about the being in front
of him. I mean, I was a drama kid. Uh,

497
00:27:36,330 --> 00:27:39,120
I stood in front of people and
taught for the past five years,

498
00:27:39,480 --> 00:27:42,480
but I saw all those people and I said,
these people believe in something.

499
00:27:43,350 --> 00:27:46,380
These people come from different places.

500
00:27:46,381 --> 00:27:48,360
These people that are
all completely different,

501
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:51,900
but they're all together
cause they believe in one
thing. And that was magical.

502
00:27:51,930 --> 00:27:54,330
And I don't use the word magical
very often. I think it's Cliche,

503
00:27:54,570 --> 00:27:58,350
but that was magical. And it was,
it was, it was amazing to see.

504
00:27:58,800 --> 00:28:02,610
But from the beginning of
our ad advocacy to the march,

505
00:28:03,870 --> 00:28:04,650
it was,

506
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:09,330
it was a lot of personalities together
and we were able to make it through the

507
00:28:09,331 --> 00:28:13,380
pain we felt together. I mean,
so often people said, well,

508
00:28:13,381 --> 00:28:16,740
why are you guys at your
school got shot up a month ago.

509
00:28:16,741 --> 00:28:20,820
Your school got shot up three weeks ago.
Why are you smiling? And I said, well,

510
00:28:21,510 --> 00:28:23,610
I,
at least from my own personal perspective,

511
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:27,840
the teacher that I was dear friends with,
that I lost Scotland want me to cry.

512
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:31,800
Scott would want me to do something.

513
00:28:31,801 --> 00:28:35,460
Scott would want me to do what I believed
in. He wasn't a very political guy,

514
00:28:35,910 --> 00:28:39,180
he will, after the shooting, he probably
wouldn't have focused on any politics.

515
00:28:39,181 --> 00:28:42,480
He would have focused on getting everybody
at Douglas to feel better, to laugh,

516
00:28:42,481 --> 00:28:46,140
to smile. But if I believed in something
and I wanted to advocate for it,

517
00:28:46,141 --> 00:28:50,820
I knew that if he were here, he'd say,
well, go do it. So the time I spent,

518
00:28:50,900 --> 00:28:55,260
I was sitting at his memorial and
I was crying and I was in the dirt.

519
00:28:55,261 --> 00:28:58,770
I was all snotty. I, I tried to wipe
my face and my dirty hands and I,

520
00:28:58,950 --> 00:29:03,300
it was what many would consider the low
point in the movie when the person feels

521
00:29:03,301 --> 00:29:04,440
like they've lost everything.

522
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:09,600
And then I thought about it and if
Scott Yoda to behind me as a ghost,

523
00:29:09,601 --> 00:29:13,480
which he and I used to talk
about actually, and I used
to talk about Yoda in, um,

524
00:29:13,590 --> 00:29:17,880
if he ordered behind me and he would say,
Cameron,

525
00:29:18,150 --> 00:29:22,440
do something. You must, he used to talk
to me in your voice a lot and not go,

526
00:29:22,441 --> 00:29:25,460
we were going to go your Yoda impression
there, and it's not gonna happen. Um,

527
00:29:25,950 --> 00:29:29,150
somebody else had the
exclusive on that one? No.

528
00:29:29,370 --> 00:29:33,240
There were points where
Scott was my teacher in fifth
grade and he owed voice to

529
00:29:33,241 --> 00:29:36,530
me while I was asking him
a genuine question, which
frustrated me a lot button.

530
00:29:36,550 --> 00:29:39,780
It's for another time.
I could do a three hour interview on him,

531
00:29:40,170 --> 00:29:44,140
but he would have said, do something.
So, so when we were all smiling together,

532
00:29:44,141 --> 00:29:45,250
when we were all laughing together,

533
00:29:45,251 --> 00:29:48,790
it was because I knew that somebody
that I loved would've wanted me to,

534
00:29:49,030 --> 00:29:50,970
and we had each other.
That's the thing. If I were,

535
00:29:51,010 --> 00:29:53,800
if I was advocating for gun control alone,
it wouldn't have worked.

536
00:29:54,070 --> 00:29:55,870
Not only because I couldn't
have done it alone.

537
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:57,520
I'm not good enough to do it alone,

538
00:29:57,820 --> 00:30:02,080
but also because we were each
other's lifeline when I was, when,

539
00:30:02,140 --> 00:30:06,220
when everything seemed awful
and everything seemed like
the world was this dark,

540
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:10,670
terrible place. I had my friends
around me to say, we got,

541
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:14,380
we're here for you. We've got this
together. And I was, you know,

542
00:30:14,381 --> 00:30:18,250
some people shoulder, many people were my
shoulder. I'm more emotional than many.

543
00:30:18,251 --> 00:30:19,031
I'm a theater students.

544
00:30:19,031 --> 00:30:24,031
So more people had to help me that I need
to help them and beyond the emotional

545
00:30:25,001 --> 00:30:28,150
part and getting everybody together.
And as you said,

546
00:30:28,151 --> 00:30:29,980
you're still a gun control
advocate and all that.

547
00:30:30,010 --> 00:30:35,010
I sent that part of what happened around
March for our lives was you saw things

548
00:30:35,141 --> 00:30:39,970
getting bizarrely political or or more
than what perhaps you are you guys

549
00:30:39,971 --> 00:30:43,180
wanted. Is that fair to say?
I think what marsh fair lives

550
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,190
should have you see to political issue.
I think the way it should have come off,

551
00:30:48,220 --> 00:30:51,550
and I think this is what everybody I
worked with believes I know for a fact is

552
00:30:51,551 --> 00:30:54,730
that our kids would want to get shot.
That's what we are at the end of the day.

553
00:30:55,210 --> 00:30:57,550
We are kids who are out here
saying we don't want to die.

554
00:30:57,850 --> 00:31:01,030
And back then I thought that if you
didn't believe in my gun control beliefs,

555
00:31:01,031 --> 00:31:04,030
you didn't care if kids died.
I learned that that's not the case.

556
00:31:04,420 --> 00:31:09,100
But that's a pretty interesting evolution
for someone at 17 to have within,

557
00:31:09,440 --> 00:31:10,630
you know,
five or six months.

558
00:31:10,700 --> 00:31:13,390
I spoke to people who disagree with me
and I learned that they want the country

559
00:31:13,391 --> 00:31:17,800
to be a better place. You know, that we
might not agree on how we might think,

560
00:31:17,801 --> 00:31:22,770
I might think that their views
are horse shit, but every,

561
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:26,770
we all agree on basically 90% of
things and I'm sure there are plenty of

562
00:31:26,771 --> 00:31:29,650
political things you and I will
disagree on, but at the end of the day,

563
00:31:29,651 --> 00:31:33,250
Tom Mcfarland is one of the most gifted
Spiderman writers to agree on that.

564
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:36,610
Do you ever do anything with DC?
I'm more of a marvel guy,

565
00:31:36,611 --> 00:31:38,800
but I had a pretty good
Batman collection for awhile.

566
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:40,360
Nightwing is my favorite superhero.

567
00:31:40,400 --> 00:31:44,020
If you're familiar as you think
they think in comic books,

568
00:31:44,021 --> 00:31:46,930
they're very afraid to make real change
and Nightwing actually was able to make

569
00:31:46,931 --> 00:31:50,040
it through that. You know, if, uh,
if a Robin became his own superhero,

570
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:52,210
normally that would only be for
10 issues and then he'd go back.

571
00:31:52,211 --> 00:31:55,600
But now you actually made that jump.
I encourage you all to read

572
00:31:57,200 --> 00:31:59,320
going back and we can focus on McFarland,

573
00:31:59,321 --> 00:32:04,030
Spiderman from to 98 to three 35
that the idea of venom is brilliant.

574
00:32:04,031 --> 00:32:08,780
But I saw the movie trailer for the movie.
We'll talk about that off camera. Um,

575
00:32:09,040 --> 00:32:13,030
that sounds good. Tom Hardy's
gifted. So, so the way,

576
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:16,090
the way people should have seen us in
the way I failed really in the messaging

577
00:32:16,091 --> 00:32:17,500
because I was so deeply involved with it,

578
00:32:17,501 --> 00:32:22,501
was we just don't want to get killed and
quickly because of the perfect storm of

579
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:23,644
everything,

580
00:32:23,950 --> 00:32:27,940
it became left versus right and,

581
00:32:28,300 --> 00:32:30,070
and I don't think anybody
in my group wanted that.

582
00:32:30,070 --> 00:32:34,720
I don't think anybody in my group wants
that at all. But it's, in one way,

583
00:32:34,721 --> 00:32:36,730
the media is the media's portrayal.

584
00:32:36,731 --> 00:32:41,570
It's in one way my personal inability to
express it correctly. And another way,

585
00:32:41,571 --> 00:32:45,710
my arrogance, because I was pretty
arrogant. I mean that in a way,

586
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:48,920
I mean that from the bottom of my heart.
I mean everybody else.

587
00:32:48,921 --> 00:32:52,910
I worked with a march for our lives was a,
a kid who wanted to help the world,

588
00:32:53,300 --> 00:32:56,960
but I was a cocky little son of a bitch.
And that,

589
00:32:56,961 --> 00:33:01,880
and that translated a lot because I said
I'm right. That's the thing. I'm right.

590
00:33:02,570 --> 00:33:07,040
Everything I say about gun control is
completely right. So, so why? Why don't,

591
00:33:07,070 --> 00:33:10,670
why aren't you listening to me?
Because I'm obviously in the right here.

592
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:15,440
Everybody else, again, was, was
basically saying, I don't want to die.

593
00:33:15,470 --> 00:33:18,500
Here's how I think it could work.
But I said, I'm right politically.

594
00:33:18,590 --> 00:33:22,490
This is my political movement.
Listened to my politics.

595
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,250
That's my fault. And that's
okay. I'm blaming myself.

596
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:29,210
I was a kid who lost friends and I
thought that this is what we needed and I

597
00:33:29,211 --> 00:33:33,660
still do, but my, my big error, my what?

598
00:33:33,680 --> 00:33:38,180
What's the, what's the word from a tragic
year? That's their flaw. Hamartia. Hubris.

599
00:33:39,080 --> 00:33:43,130
Well, this is your Hubris,
I suppose. Yeah. That, let's
call it the Hebrew. So again,

600
00:33:43,131 --> 00:33:47,690
I didn't take AP Lang or AP lit.
I can tell you my favorite tragic heroes.

601
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,750
I love tragic heroes. But
my hubris was, and again,

602
00:33:50,751 --> 00:33:54,350
I could be interpreting this wrong,
I just thought I was right.

603
00:33:55,200 --> 00:33:58,550
I thought that anybody who didn't
agree with me because I was so right,

604
00:33:58,650 --> 00:34:03,260
we wanted kids to die. 1% of the, no,

605
00:34:03,350 --> 00:34:04,183
I wouldn't say that.

606
00:34:04,250 --> 00:34:07,400
My guess is that 3% of the country
doesn't care when kids die.

607
00:34:07,880 --> 00:34:11,960
3% just as not my kid or you know,
it's not where I am,

608
00:34:12,260 --> 00:34:15,530
but the rest of the country doesn't
want kids to die. And you know,

609
00:34:16,250 --> 00:34:17,210
I learned about that,

610
00:34:17,211 --> 00:34:21,560
that family in Texas where the mom and
the dad both carry weapons because they

611
00:34:21,561 --> 00:34:22,520
want to protect their family.

612
00:34:22,940 --> 00:34:27,940
I learned about the people in everywhere
who want to protect their families.

613
00:34:28,491 --> 00:34:31,940
I have guns in my house and while I
believe in an assault weapons ban,

614
00:34:31,941 --> 00:34:33,710
or at least much more restrictive laws,

615
00:34:34,250 --> 00:34:37,940
if you want to hurt my autistic brother
and I have a gun, you're in trouble.

616
00:34:38,660 --> 00:34:39,890
So when you see

617
00:34:40,040 --> 00:34:43,900
someone like David Hogg and
I'm only mentioning because
he's been so vocal on or

618
00:34:43,901 --> 00:34:46,040
you know, I tried to talk
about ideas and not people,

619
00:34:46,041 --> 00:34:49,730
but when you see someone like him tweeting
all of these things, but you know,

620
00:34:50,390 --> 00:34:54,770
I don't want to get an exact quote
crossed up here, but to the effect,

621
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,640
if you don't agree with me, you want
dead kids. Republicans want dead kids.

622
00:34:58,641 --> 00:35:01,460
Marco Rubio doesn't want to save anybody.

623
00:35:01,461 --> 00:35:06,461
While all of these things you now
realize that's just not the way to do it.

624
00:35:07,260 --> 00:35:09,920
That is not true and it's not.
It's not actually effective.

625
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:13,180
The reason I criticize myself and
not my friends, because I know David,

626
00:35:13,181 --> 00:35:16,840
David is a dear friend of mine.
I've known him for a couple of years,

627
00:35:16,841 --> 00:35:19,870
but I've only known him really well since
the shooting in a class with him once.

628
00:35:19,871 --> 00:35:24,310
He was nice guy. Everything David does,
and I know we're not talking specifics,

629
00:35:24,311 --> 00:35:27,640
but I'll just use David as an example
because much like everybody else in March

630
00:35:27,641 --> 00:35:29,500
for our lives,
everything David does,

631
00:35:29,501 --> 00:35:32,140
he does because he wants the
country to be a better place.

632
00:35:32,560 --> 00:35:35,800
He and I don't always see perfectly
eye to eye on what exactly to do,

633
00:35:36,040 --> 00:35:40,750
but every time I something he tweets
that I don't like and uh, I love,

634
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:45,000
I think about it and I say I've
spent hours of David, I've known him,

635
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:48,960
I know him so incredibly well
because we have this dark, tragic,

636
00:35:48,961 --> 00:35:52,410
terrible bond that was really created
after the worst case scenario.

637
00:35:52,890 --> 00:35:54,630
But when David says something
that I don't agree with,

638
00:35:54,631 --> 00:35:58,890
he's saying it because he doesn't
want another kid to die. So you know,

639
00:35:58,891 --> 00:36:02,760
messaging with everybody in the group
is occasionally not really in sync.

640
00:36:02,761 --> 00:36:05,130
We agree.
We disagree on things sometimes.

641
00:36:05,460 --> 00:36:10,460
But if I thought that people in March
for our lives like David or anyone was in

642
00:36:10,471 --> 00:36:11,670
this for the wrong reasons,

643
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:13,500
I would be [inaudible] I
would instantly call them out.

644
00:36:14,130 --> 00:36:15,660
I don't think that's the case.
Yeah.

645
00:36:15,750 --> 00:36:18,840
Unfortunately the road to hell is paved
with good intentions and I don't want to

646
00:36:19,230 --> 00:36:21,710
smirch his intentions.
I believe you.

647
00:36:21,960 --> 00:36:26,440
I believe you that his intentions are
pure. I, of course, I believe that David,

648
00:36:26,480 --> 00:36:29,100
David's a guy who cares so deeply
about the world around him,

649
00:36:29,101 --> 00:36:31,110
and we'll do whatever it takes
to make it a better place.

650
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:33,660
But it's funny that you say the road
to hell is paved with good intentions

651
00:36:33,900 --> 00:36:38,850
because our summer tour where we went
around and advocating for more voter

652
00:36:38,851 --> 00:36:42,090
registration and more accessible voting
around the country was called road to

653
00:36:42,091 --> 00:36:44,910
change.
And there was a counter protest,

654
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:48,930
or at one of our events that said more
like the road to hell. And I said, hey,

655
00:36:49,620 --> 00:36:50,490
that's not very nice.

656
00:36:51,020 --> 00:36:54,430
[inaudible].
