00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.310
GILBERT STRANG: OK.

00:00:01.310 --> 00:00:04.480
This video is about the
third of the great trio

00:00:04.480 --> 00:00:07.030
of partial
differential equations.

00:00:07.030 --> 00:00:09.130
Laplace's equation
was number one.

00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:11.990
That's called an
elliptic equation.

00:00:11.990 --> 00:00:14.310
The heat equation
was number two.

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:17.040
That's called a
parabolic equation.

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:19.340
Now we reach the wave equation.

00:00:19.340 --> 00:00:23.270
That's number three, and it's
called a hyperbolic equation.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.760
So somehow the three
equations remind us

00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:30.000
of ellipses, parabolas,
and hyperbolas.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.560
They have different
types of solutions.

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:36.960
Laplace's equation, you
solve it inside a circle

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.860
or inside some closed region.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:43.440
The heat equation and
the wave equation, time

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.920
enters, and you're
going forward in time.

00:00:47.920 --> 00:00:52.170
The heat equation is first
order in time, du dt.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:56.620
And the wave equation, the
full-scale wave equation,

00:00:56.620 --> 00:00:58.570
is second order in time.

00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:02.140
That stands for the second
derivative, d second u

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.480
dt squared.

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.360
And it matches the
second derivative

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.360
in space with a velocity
coefficient c squared.

00:01:14.300 --> 00:01:16.710
I'm in one-dimensional space.

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:19.810
If I were in three
dimensions, where we really

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:24.050
have sound waves and light
waves and all the most important

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:29.150
things in life, then there
would be a uxx and a uyy

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:35.010
and a uzz, second derivatives
in all the space directions.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:37.670
But that's good enough to do 1D.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.220
So what are the
differences, first of all,

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:43.220
between the heat equation
and wave equation?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:51.020
So I'll say heat
versus wave equations.

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:55.000
What are the sort of
biggest differences?

00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:05.550
The heat, the signal
travels infinitely fast.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.170
Under the wave
equation, the signal

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:22.210
travels with finite
velocity, and that velocity

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:30.910
is that number c with speed c.

00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:37.020
So fortunately, for sound
waves, the wave comes to us,

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:44.680
or when I'm speaking
to you, my voice

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.810
is traveling out
to the microphone

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.580
at the speed of
sound, the speed c.

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:57.620
And actually, another good
thing is after it gets there,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:01.080
it goes on, and it
goes by the point

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:08.060
and doesn't just stay there
messing up the future sounds.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:09.020
It travels.

00:03:09.020 --> 00:03:10.820
It dies out.

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:15.960
Whereas-- well, the heat.

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.660
So let me try to
give an example.

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:23.210
Suppose the initial condition
is a delta function.

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:32.060
So if u equals a delta
function, a point source,

00:03:32.060 --> 00:03:33.210
which is quite normal.

00:03:33.210 --> 00:03:38.090
A point source of heat,
something really hot,

00:03:38.090 --> 00:03:42.960
or a point source
of sound, my voice.

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.630
So it's that at t equals 0.

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:54.060
Then for the heat
equation, there's

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:58.600
a famous solution to
the heat equation.

00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:05.200
Remember, the heat equation
is du dt equal uxx,

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:07.615
first derivative in time.

00:04:07.615 --> 00:04:10.940
And the solution that starts
from the delta function?

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.350
Oh, do I know what it is?

00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:17.110
I think there's a 1 over--
there's a square root of 4

00:04:17.110 --> 00:04:19.269
pi t.

00:04:19.269 --> 00:04:23.496
There's an e to the
minus x squared over 4t.

00:04:23.496 --> 00:04:26.230
I think perhaps that's it.

00:04:26.230 --> 00:04:28.190
Perhaps that's it.

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:32.250
So what do I see from that?

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.670
I see big damping out.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:37.110
I see immediate travel.

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.080
As soon as time is just
a little beyond 0, then

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:45.860
for every x we get an answer,
but it's an extremely,

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:49.860
extremely small answer.
e to the minus x squared

00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.020
is tailing off to
0 incredibly fast.

00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:55.690
So that's a very small answer.

00:04:55.690 --> 00:04:59.770
Very little of the heat
immediately gets very,

00:04:59.770 --> 00:05:02.760
very quickly across the ocean.

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.510
But in theory, a
little bit does.

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.640
Whereas for the
wave equation, it

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:11.250
takes time to cross the ocean.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:12.370
We have a tsunami.

00:05:12.370 --> 00:05:13.420
We have a wave.

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.660
It gets there.

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:16.200
It reaches the other side.

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.830
And actually, at the--
it's very important.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:24.390
What is the speed of
that wave to tell people

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.380
about a tsunami that's
coming, and you can actually

00:05:27.380 --> 00:05:30.400
do it, which you couldn't
do for the heat equation.

00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:38.030
So for the wave
equation, what comes out

00:05:38.030 --> 00:05:40.530
of a delta function in 1D?

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:45.260
Well, a wave goes to the right,
and a wave goes to the left.

00:05:45.260 --> 00:05:46.510
That's what happens.

00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:51.210
And those waves are 1/2 of
a delta function each way.

00:05:51.210 --> 00:05:56.140
So the solution is 1/2
of a delta function

00:05:56.140 --> 00:05:56.920
that's traveling.

00:05:59.710 --> 00:06:03.930
I see that-- let me write
down the other half that's

00:06:03.930 --> 00:06:09.915
traveling the other
way-- delta at x plus ct.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.140
That's a cool solution.

00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:18.340
So that means the
sound in 1D, the sound,

00:06:18.340 --> 00:06:20.605
half of it takes
off in one direction

00:06:20.605 --> 00:06:23.070
and half in the other direction.

00:06:23.070 --> 00:06:29.620
And what happens in each
direction is a spike of sound.

00:06:29.620 --> 00:06:33.510
You don't hear anything,
then at a particular time,

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:36.530
depending on your
position x, there's

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:40.720
a particular time when
you get 0 in there,

00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.200
and you hear the signal.

00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:48.410
And then as soon as time goes
past that, it's past you.

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:54.100
So you get a big shock, and
it comes to you with speed c.

00:06:54.100 --> 00:06:58.470
If you look at that
expression x minus ct,

00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:03.636
it's telling you that
the speed of the wave

00:07:03.636 --> 00:07:07.862
in dx dt for the wave is c.

00:07:07.862 --> 00:07:08.830
OK.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:15.010
So that's a contrast for a very
particular initial condition--

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:21.550
a big wall of water, a
big noise, a big bang.

00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:23.530
OK.

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.230
I want to solve
the wave equation,

00:07:28.230 --> 00:07:31.960
study it further for
other initial conditions.

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.400
And of course, initial
condition's plural

00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:40.670
because the wave equation
is second order in time.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:52.420
So I'm given u at t equals
0 and all x and du dt.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.350
I'm given an
initial distribution

00:08:00.350 --> 00:08:05.390
of the wall of
water, shall we say,

00:08:05.390 --> 00:08:11.030
and its velocity,
the normal thing.

00:08:11.030 --> 00:08:12.850
When I have a
second-order equation,

00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:16.720
I'm given an initial condition
and an initial velocity.

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.810
And of course, because it's a
partial differential equation,

00:08:19.810 --> 00:08:23.190
I'm given those for every x.

00:08:23.190 --> 00:08:26.060
So we have functions
instead of just two numbers,

00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:29.340
and that's where a Fourier
series can come in.

00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:32.120
So we can solve that
by a Fourier series

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:37.380
if we're on a finite--
like a violin string.

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:39.919
You've plucked a
violin string that

00:08:39.919 --> 00:08:44.560
starts waves going back
and forth in the string.

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.340
They solve the wave equation.

00:08:46.340 --> 00:08:53.240
You hear music, great
music if it's a good sound.

00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:58.210
Or we could solve it on an
infinite line with no boundary,

00:08:58.210 --> 00:09:04.060
as in an essentially infinite
ocean or waves in space.

00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.990
Light waves in space are
solving the wave equation

00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.920
with no boundary,
as far as we know.

00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:13.550
OK.

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.420
So which shall I do?

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:20.770
I'll write the solution
down in free space,

00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:24.550
and then I'll write one
down for a violin string.

00:09:24.550 --> 00:09:33.300
So in space-- well, it's a
one-dimensional space here.

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:38.360
So this would be minus infinity
less than x less than infinity.

00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:43.330
Then what does the solution to
the wave equation look like?

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:52.470
It looks like some function
of plus some function

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.350
of x plus ct.

00:09:55.350 --> 00:10:00.840
Well, that's exactly the
form that we had here

00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:03.220
when they were delta functions.

00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.490
Here, in general, they don't
have to be delta functions.

00:10:07.490 --> 00:10:12.520
I chose that function f and
that function g so that at t

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:14.470
equals 0, I'm good.

00:10:14.470 --> 00:10:17.930
So at t equals 0--
so I set t equals 0.

00:10:17.930 --> 00:10:29.490
At t equals 0, u of 0 and x
would be f of x plus g of x.

00:10:29.490 --> 00:10:30.550
Good.

00:10:30.550 --> 00:10:35.280
But that's only one condition,
and I have f and g to find.

00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:42.480
So I would also use
du dt at the start.

00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:43.880
What's the time derivative?

00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:49.710
It's minus c f prime at x.

00:10:49.710 --> 00:10:59.810
And the time derivative of this
will be a plus c g prime at x.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:01.140
OK.

00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:02.590
No big deal.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.660
I'm given two functions.

00:11:04.660 --> 00:11:07.510
I've got two functions
to find in the answer,

00:11:07.510 --> 00:11:09.220
and I've got two equations.

00:11:09.220 --> 00:11:13.130
I could solve those for f
and g, and it gives a formula

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.020
called d'Alembert's formula,
named after the person who

00:11:17.020 --> 00:11:20.010
put this together.

00:11:20.010 --> 00:11:24.680
I'd rather go on to the
violin, to a finite string.

00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:25.180
OK.

00:11:25.180 --> 00:11:28.520
So now I have a
finite string, and I'm

00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:33.210
holding u equals 0 at the ends.

00:11:33.210 --> 00:11:34.310
OK.

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:38.170
And my solution will
still be functions that

00:11:38.170 --> 00:11:41.950
depend on x minus ct waves.

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.990
My solution will still be waves.

00:11:44.990 --> 00:11:46.840
The solution that I'm
going to write down

00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:49.940
comes from a very,
very important method

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:53.150
called separation of variables.

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:56.430
I want to separate x from t.

00:11:56.430 --> 00:12:00.580
I need to give you a full video
about separation of variables.

00:12:00.580 --> 00:12:04.300
That's the best tool we
have to get solutions

00:12:04.300 --> 00:12:06.560
to lots of equations.

00:12:06.560 --> 00:12:09.880
So let me just jump to the
form of the solution here.

00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:14.240
I'm imagining the violin
string is at rest.

00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:16.890
So it starts with--
I'm imagining,

00:12:16.890 --> 00:12:19.060
let's say in our
particular problem,

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.950
this is 0, the initial velocity.

00:12:21.950 --> 00:12:25.000
This is plucked.

00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.660
The starting position
is-- with your finger

00:12:29.660 --> 00:12:32.320
you've moved it off 0.

00:12:32.320 --> 00:12:34.300
OK.

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:38.420
What do the solutions
look like, u of t and x?

00:12:38.420 --> 00:12:39.890
OK.

00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:48.790
They will be a sum of neat,
special, convenient, separated

00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:53.430
solutions, with separated
meaning t separated from x.

00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:57.912
And I think we would
have cosine of nct.

00:13:00.990 --> 00:13:02.080
I'm going to have a sum.

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:08.110
Oh, we'll have a coefficient,
of course, a sub-- well, or b,

00:13:08.110 --> 00:13:09.690
or c, or even d.

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:13.800
How about d for a
new letter-- d sub n.

00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:17.320
And I think-- well,
let me finish here.

00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:20.320
I'm separating that from
I think it would probably

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:24.410
be the sine of nx.

00:13:24.410 --> 00:13:25.030
OK.

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:27.060
If we just look at
that for a little bit,

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.530
that's the point of this video.

00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:32.870
So this is x equals 0.

00:13:32.870 --> 00:13:35.880
This is, say, x equal pi.

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.120
That's for convenience.

00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.310
Suppose our violin
string has length pi,

00:13:42.310 --> 00:13:47.710
then, I think, that's what
the solution looks like.

00:13:47.710 --> 00:13:51.560
It starts from at t equals 0.

00:13:55.850 --> 00:13:58.490
At t equals 0, the cosine is 1.

00:13:58.490 --> 00:14:01.040
So at t equals 0, this
is an initial condition

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:02.400
that we have to match.

00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:09.000
This'll tell us the d's will
be the sum of dn sine nx.

00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.390
That tells us the d's.

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:27.260
And then we have our answer.

00:14:27.260 --> 00:14:29.570
So the initial
condition-- remember,

00:14:29.570 --> 00:14:30.650
it's starting at rest.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:33.190
So the initial velocity
is 0, and that's

00:14:33.190 --> 00:14:36.640
why I don't have any sine
t's because I'm starting

00:14:36.640 --> 00:14:38.580
with initial velocity 0.

00:14:38.580 --> 00:14:41.190
I only have cosines
in the t direction.

00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.690
But I only have sines
in the x direction

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:47.410
because the violin
string is being held down

00:14:47.410 --> 00:14:50.450
at the two ends, and
it's the sine function

00:14:50.450 --> 00:14:52.620
that matches that perfectly.

00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:57.700
So this is separation of
variables, t separated from x.

00:14:57.700 --> 00:15:01.170
And I really have to
do a proper explanation

00:15:01.170 --> 00:15:07.120
of that highly important method
of getting solutions like this.

00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:08.920
Thank you.
