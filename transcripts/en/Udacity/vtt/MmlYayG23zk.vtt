00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.840
So, file has a write method which writes to a file and we can pass in a string.

00:00:04.840 --> 00:00:09.171
So, that will write the line import this, to the file wim.py in the current

00:00:09.171 --> 00:00:13.230
directory. When we're done with the file, we should always remember to close it.

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:16.640
And the reason we want to close files is operating systems do lots of strange

00:00:16.640 --> 00:00:20.084
things with files to try to maintain them, to buffer them. The changes that we

00:00:20.084 --> 00:00:23.317
think we made with our program might not actually be there if we don't close it.

00:00:23.318 --> 00:00:26.850
It also might cause problems if there are open file handles left that weren't

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:30.912
closed when the program executed. So, we should close the file after we're done

00:00:30.912 --> 00:00:34.208
with it. So now we'll have a quiz to see if you can think about all the things

00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:38.205
that could possible go wrong with this code. The choices are, the call to open

00:00:38.205 --> 00:00:43.005
fails if the current directory is not writable, the call to write fails if the

00:00:43.005 --> 00:00:47.730
disk is full, a cosmic ray hits the processor at the wrong time, changing the

00:00:47.730 --> 00:00:52.305
string from import this to import thus, there's a power outage before the

00:00:52.305 --> 00:00:57.899
fout.close completes, leaving the file in a corrupted state. Check all of the

00:00:57.899 --> 00:00:59.733
ones that could possibly go wrong.
