00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.620
Identify the x and
y-intercepts of the line

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:06.880
y is equal to 3x minus 9.

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.150
Then graph the line.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.450
So the x-intercept,
I'll just abbreviate it

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:15.820
as x-int, that is where the
line intersects the x-axis.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:17.920
So where it
intersects the x-axis.

00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:20.830
Remember, this horizontal
axis is the x-axis.

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:22.919
So when something
intersects the x-axis,

00:00:22.919 --> 00:00:24.460
what do we know
about its coordinate?

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:28.325
Its x-value could be anything,
but we know it's y-value is 0.

00:00:28.325 --> 00:00:29.950
If we're intersecting,
if we're sitting

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.280
on the x-axis
someplace, that means

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.380
that we haven't moved
in the y-direction.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.100
That means that y is 0.

00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:39.610
So this means,
literally, that y is 0.

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:42.190
So we need to find
the x-value defined

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:45.400
by this relationship
when y is equal to 0.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.912
Similarly, when we talk
about the y-intercept,

00:00:47.912 --> 00:00:49.370
I'll do it down
here-- when we talk

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:52.126
about the y-intercept,
what does that mean?

00:00:52.126 --> 00:00:53.500
Well, y-intercept
means-- so this

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:56.160
is the y-axis right over
here running up and down.

00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:58.020
The y-intercept is
the point at which

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:01.239
the line intercepts the y-axis.

00:01:01.239 --> 00:01:02.030
So what's going on?

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:04.650
If we're at the
y-axis, our y-value

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:07.600
could be anything depending on
where we intersect the y-axis.

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.470
But we know that we haven't
moved to the right or the left.

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:14.470
We know that our x-value
is 0 at the y-intercept.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.400
So over here, our
x-value is going to be 0.

00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:19.140
And to find the
actual point, we just

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:21.760
have to find the
corresponding y-value defined

00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:24.440
by this relationship
or this equation.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:25.850
So let's do the first one first.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:28.010
The x-intercept is
when y is equal to 0.

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:31.130
So we set y is equal to 0,
and then we'll solve for x.

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:34.650
So we get 0 is
equal to 3x minus 9.

00:01:34.650 --> 00:01:37.630
We can add 9 to both
sides of this equation

00:01:37.630 --> 00:01:39.120
to isolate the x-term.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:42.000
So we get 9 is equal to 3x.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.460
These cancel out.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.410
We could divide both sides by 3.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:48.260
Divide both sides by 3.

00:01:48.260 --> 00:01:52.930
We get 3 is equal to
x or x is equal to 3.

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:56.925
So the point y is equal to 0, x
is equal to 3 is on this line.

00:01:56.925 --> 00:01:58.050
And let me put it in order.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.535
x-coordinate always goes first.

00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:02.260
So it's 3 comma 0.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:03.470
So this is the origin.

00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:06.440
1, 2, 3 is right over here.

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:08.900
That is 3 comma 0.

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.030
This right here is
the x-intercept.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:15.720
And remember, notice that
point lies on the x-axis,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:17.190
but the y-value is 0.

00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:18.414
We haven't moved up or down.

00:02:18.414 --> 00:02:20.080
When you think
x-intercept, you say, OK,

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:22.380
that means my y-value is 0.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.170
So I have to solve
for the x-value.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:26.660
Now we do the opposite
for the y-intercept.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:29.090
And the y-intercept, we're
sitting on this line,

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:30.380
x-value must be 0.

00:02:30.380 --> 00:02:34.100
So let's figure out what y is
equal to when x is equal to 0.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:37.110
So y is equal to-- I want
to do it in that pink color.

00:02:37.110 --> 00:02:42.060
y is equal to-- y is equal
to 3 times-- x is 0 now.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:44.620
3 times 0 minus 9.

00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:46.230
Well, 3 times 0 is just 0.

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:47.560
So 0 minus 9.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.520
Well that's, just
equal to negative 9.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:52.810
So we have the point
0 comma negative 9.

00:02:52.810 --> 00:02:57.870
So when x is 0, we
go down 9 for y.

00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:04.720
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:08.620
So right there is the
point 0 comma negative 9.

00:03:08.620 --> 00:03:10.740
Notice, it sits on the y-axis.

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.340
That's why it's the y-intercept.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.800
And the x-value is 0.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.480
We haven't moved to
the left or right.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.110
All you need is two
points for a line,

00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:18.290
so we're now ready to graph.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:20.350
We essentially just have
to connect the dots.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:22.430
So it's going to look
something like this.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:25.909
It's going to look
something-- our line.

00:03:25.909 --> 00:03:27.450
I don't have a good
line tool, so I'm

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:30.240
going to try my best
to draw it nicely--

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.860
is going to look
something like that.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:34.950
And you just keep going.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.040
You just keep going.

00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:37.870
You want to do a straight line.

00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:41.940
So it just keeps going on
and on and on like that.

00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:45.752
It just keeps going.

00:03:45.752 --> 00:03:47.960
And I could keep going all
the way in that direction,

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:50.293
and then-- but then my line
doesn't look as straight all

00:03:50.293 --> 00:03:50.835
of a sudden.

00:03:50.835 --> 00:03:52.210
I think you get
the general idea.

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.200
I can keep going like that,
and then keep going like that.

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.010
I don't have a nice
ruler to do it with.

00:03:56.010 --> 00:03:57.850
And we're done.
