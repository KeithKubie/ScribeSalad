00:00:00.561 --> 00:00:02.209
- [Voiceover] Consider the polynomials,

00:00:02.209 --> 00:00:04.832
P of X is equal to X to the
sixth minus X to the fifth

00:00:04.832 --> 00:00:07.201
minus X to the third
minus X squared minus X.

00:00:07.201 --> 00:00:09.431
And Q of X is equal to X to the fourth

00:00:09.431 --> 00:00:12.570
minus X to the third
minus X squared minus one.

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.728
Given that Z one, Z
two, Z three, and Z four

00:00:15.728 --> 00:00:18.955
are the roots of Q of X equals zero,

00:00:18.955 --> 00:00:21.278
find P of Z one plus P of Z two,

00:00:21.278 --> 00:00:25.039
plus P of Z three, plus P of Z four.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:26.131
So a good place to start,

00:00:26.131 --> 00:00:28.197
and you might have already realized this,

00:00:28.197 --> 00:00:32.237
that if these guys are the
roots of Q of X equals zero,

00:00:32.237 --> 00:00:34.933
that means that Q of Z one

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:37.923
is equal to Q of Z two,

00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:41.173
which is equal to Q of Z three,

00:00:41.173 --> 00:00:43.983
which is equal to Q of Z four,

00:00:43.983 --> 00:00:45.539
which is equal to zero.

00:00:45.539 --> 00:00:48.853
They're the roots, they are
solutions to this equation here.

00:00:48.853 --> 00:00:50.432
Now given that, and we want to evaluate

00:00:50.432 --> 00:00:53.033
P of Z one plus P of Z two,

00:00:53.033 --> 00:00:55.795
it seems like it would be useful if we can

00:00:55.795 --> 00:00:58.786
express P of X in terms of Q of X,

00:00:58.786 --> 00:01:01.108
because then when we evaluate these,

00:01:01.108 --> 00:01:03.741
the parts that would
be Q of Z one or Z two

00:01:03.741 --> 00:01:06.064
or whatever would evaluate to zero.

00:01:06.064 --> 00:01:07.899
So let's try to do that over there.

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:09.269
So the first thing I'm gonna try to do,

00:01:09.269 --> 00:01:11.637
I'm gonna try to express
these higher degree terms

00:01:11.637 --> 00:01:13.100
in terms of Q of X.

00:01:13.100 --> 00:01:16.072
And to do that, if I multiple
Q of X times X squared,

00:01:16.072 --> 00:01:18.208
this X to the fourth will
become an X to the sixth,

00:01:18.208 --> 00:01:20.321
this X to the third will
become an X to the fifth.

00:01:20.321 --> 00:01:21.784
It won't be exact, but we might be able to

00:01:21.784 --> 00:01:25.029
adjust a little bit to get
something right over here.

00:01:25.029 --> 00:01:26.143
So let's try to do that.

00:01:26.143 --> 00:01:28.629
So let's think a little bit about what,

00:01:28.629 --> 00:01:30.522
let's think about what X squared,

00:01:31.247 --> 00:01:34.615
X squared times Q of X
is going to look like.

00:01:34.615 --> 00:01:36.866
That's going to be X squared
times X to the fourth.

00:01:36.866 --> 00:01:40.790
That's X to the sixth,
minus X to the fifth,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.090
minus X to the fourth,

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:44.297
minus X squared.

00:01:44.297 --> 00:01:46.201
Just multiplied all of these terms

00:01:46.201 --> 00:01:48.616
times X squared.

00:01:48.616 --> 00:01:53.051
Now that isn't exactly what
we have up here for P of X.

00:01:53.051 --> 00:01:54.955
In order to get it exact,

00:01:54.955 --> 00:01:56.835
in order to get it exact,

00:01:56.835 --> 00:01:59.156
we need to, what are
we going to have to do?

00:01:59.156 --> 00:02:01.339
Let's see, we don't have
an X to the fourth up here,

00:02:01.339 --> 00:02:03.058
so we're gonna have to get
rid of this X to the fourth.

00:02:03.058 --> 00:02:05.417
So let's add X to the
fourth to both sides.

00:02:06.188 --> 00:02:10.159
So let's add X to the fourth
to both sides of this equation.

00:02:10.159 --> 00:02:12.050
So that would get rid
of an X to the fourth.

00:02:12.916 --> 00:02:14.565
And let's see, we have
no X to the third here,

00:02:14.565 --> 00:02:15.888
we do have an X to the third there,

00:02:15.888 --> 00:02:17.862
so let's subtract X to the third

00:02:17.862 --> 00:02:20.555
from both sides of this equation.

00:02:20.555 --> 00:02:22.807
So I'm gonna subtract X to the third

00:02:22.807 --> 00:02:25.036
from both sides of this equation.

00:02:25.036 --> 00:02:26.848
And then we do have a negative X squared,

00:02:26.848 --> 00:02:29.401
we do have a negative X squared over here.

00:02:29.401 --> 00:02:31.561
And then we have a negative X here.

00:02:31.561 --> 00:02:33.976
I don't see a negative X over here,

00:02:33.976 --> 00:02:36.484
so let's subtract a
negative X from both sides.

00:02:36.484 --> 00:02:37.482
So negative X.

00:02:37.482 --> 00:02:39.200
This is all for the left-hand side.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.785
And so we're left with

00:02:41.336 --> 00:02:43.276
the left-hand side of the equation we get

00:02:43.276 --> 00:02:45.913
X squared times Q of X,

00:02:46.731 --> 00:02:49.623
X squared times Q of X
plus X to the fourth,

00:02:50.301 --> 00:02:52.693
plus X to the fourth minus X to the third,

00:02:52.693 --> 00:02:54.992
minus X is equal to,

00:02:54.992 --> 00:02:55.874
what's this equal to?

00:02:55.874 --> 00:02:59.024
It's equal to X to the sixth.

00:02:59.024 --> 00:03:01.439
I didn't want to use that shade of purple,

00:03:01.439 --> 00:03:02.600
let me use the blue one.

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:05.171
It's equal to X to the sixth

00:03:05.171 --> 00:03:07.564
minus X to the fifth,

00:03:07.564 --> 00:03:09.398
these guys cancel out,

00:03:09.398 --> 00:03:11.697
minus X to the third,

00:03:11.697 --> 00:03:14.608
minus X to third minus X squared,

00:03:15.412 --> 00:03:16.642
minus X squared,

00:03:16.642 --> 00:03:19.094
and then you have a minus X there.

00:03:19.094 --> 00:03:19.976
Minus X.

00:03:19.976 --> 00:03:21.486
Which is exactly, this is,

00:03:21.486 --> 00:03:24.481
we were actually able to
completely construct P of X.

00:03:24.481 --> 00:03:26.825
This is equal to P of X.

00:03:26.825 --> 00:03:29.613
It's equal to all of this
business on the left-hand side.

00:03:29.613 --> 00:03:31.577
Now we could just stop
there, but it looks,

00:03:31.577 --> 00:03:33.482
this part right here,

00:03:33.482 --> 00:03:35.897
this part right here
looks tantalizingly close

00:03:35.897 --> 00:03:37.987
to Q of X as well.

00:03:37.987 --> 00:03:40.355
In fact it is, that part right there,

00:03:40.355 --> 00:03:43.861
using the exact same
process would be Q of X,

00:03:43.861 --> 00:03:46.031
just the green part, it's Q of X

00:03:46.031 --> 00:03:47.634
with these things gotten rid of.

00:03:47.634 --> 00:03:49.724
So we would have to add an X squared.

00:03:49.724 --> 00:03:51.937
So it's Q of X plus X squared,

00:03:52.939 --> 00:03:55.239
plus X squared plus one.

00:03:55.239 --> 00:03:56.563
Right? If you start with Q of X,

00:03:56.563 --> 00:03:57.956
you add an X squared, you add a one,

00:03:57.956 --> 00:03:58.931
these two will go away,

00:03:58.931 --> 00:04:02.158
you just have an X to the
fourth minus X to the third.

00:04:02.158 --> 00:04:04.643
So now we can rewrite P of X.

00:04:04.643 --> 00:04:07.545
We can rewrite P of X,
I'll do it right over here,

00:04:07.545 --> 00:04:11.663
P of X is equal to X squared times Q of X,

00:04:12.498 --> 00:04:14.830
it's equal to, no,
that's not the same blue.

00:04:15.579 --> 00:04:18.759
It's equal to X squared

00:04:18.759 --> 00:04:23.474
times Q of X plus this business,

00:04:24.292 --> 00:04:25.853
plus Q of X,

00:04:26.764 --> 00:04:29.899
plus X squared plus one.

00:04:29.899 --> 00:04:32.360
And then we have this last negative X,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:35.262
or last minus X right over there.

00:04:35.262 --> 00:04:38.118
Now, when we evaluate, if I say,

00:04:38.118 --> 00:04:40.022
if I say that R is a root.

00:04:40.022 --> 00:04:42.925
So if R is a root of Q.

00:04:42.925 --> 00:04:46.524
Or if I write Q of R is equal to zero,

00:04:46.524 --> 00:04:48.659
then what is P of R?

00:04:48.659 --> 00:04:52.351
P of R is going to be equal to X squared

00:04:52.351 --> 00:04:55.987
times Q of R plus Q of R,

00:04:56.828 --> 00:04:59.336
plus R squared, I'll switch these,

00:04:59.336 --> 00:05:01.101
minus R, plus one.

00:05:01.101 --> 00:05:02.656
So this is going to be zero, obviously.

00:05:02.656 --> 00:05:05.350
Q of R is zero, so this
whole term is zero.

00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:06.766
This whole term is zero.

00:05:06.766 --> 00:05:08.833
So P of R is going to be equal to

00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:12.641
R squared minus R, plus one.

00:05:12.641 --> 00:05:15.218
Now, obviously all of these guys are roots

00:05:15.218 --> 00:05:17.401
so we can use that same logic.

00:05:17.401 --> 00:05:19.188
We can use that same logic.

00:05:19.188 --> 00:05:22.889
We can say P of, let
me do a new color here.

00:05:23.568 --> 00:05:24.904
A new color is warranted.

00:05:25.769 --> 00:05:30.667
P of Z one is equal to Z one squared,

00:05:30.667 --> 00:05:34.197
minus Z one plus one.

00:05:34.197 --> 00:05:36.078
P of Z two,

00:05:36.078 --> 00:05:40.304
P of Z two is equal to Z two squared,

00:05:40.304 --> 00:05:42.485
minus Z two plus one.

00:05:42.485 --> 00:05:44.692
I could, I'll go all four.

00:05:44.692 --> 00:05:46.318
P of Z three.

00:05:46.318 --> 00:05:50.334
P of Z three is equal to Z three squared,

00:05:50.334 --> 00:05:52.958
minus Z three plus one.

00:05:52.958 --> 00:05:56.580
And then finally we have P of Z four.

00:05:56.580 --> 00:06:00.319
P of Z four, in that slightly
different shade of orange,

00:06:00.319 --> 00:06:04.963
is Z sub four squared
minus Z sub four plus one.

00:06:04.963 --> 00:06:06.124
Now remember our problem.

00:06:06.124 --> 00:06:07.842
We just want to find
the sum of these things.

00:06:07.842 --> 00:06:10.791
We just want to take the sum.

00:06:10.791 --> 00:06:13.947
So this sum is going to be
the sum of these expressions

00:06:13.947 --> 00:06:17.036
and you might be saying,
Sal, we still don't know

00:06:17.036 --> 00:06:18.127
what these sums are.

00:06:18.127 --> 00:06:20.705
I could sum all the ones,
I'll get a four there,

00:06:20.705 --> 00:06:22.772
but now I have to sum
all the roots of Q of X

00:06:22.772 --> 00:06:25.442
and I have to sum all the
squares of the roots of Q of X?

00:06:25.442 --> 00:06:27.578
And this is not a simple thing

00:06:27.578 --> 00:06:30.643
and frankly it's not taught
in most algebra classes

00:06:30.643 --> 00:06:31.641
or precalculus classes.

00:06:31.641 --> 00:06:33.777
This is a problem to
really separate the people

00:06:33.777 --> 00:06:37.701
who study kind of quirky
properties of polynomials

00:06:37.701 --> 00:06:38.956
from the people who don't study

00:06:38.956 --> 00:06:40.626
quirky properties of polynomials,

00:06:40.626 --> 00:06:42.113
but the last two videos I just recorded

00:06:42.113 --> 00:06:44.296
in the competition math playlist,

00:06:44.296 --> 00:06:46.222
and I actually added them to
the algebra playlist as well,

00:06:46.222 --> 00:06:48.893
tell you how to find the sum
of the roots of a polynomial

00:06:48.893 --> 00:06:51.934
or the sum of the squares of
the roots of a polynomial.

00:06:51.934 --> 00:06:53.885
So let's think about this a little bit.

00:06:53.885 --> 00:06:56.138
So let's add up all the ones, that's easy,

00:06:56.138 --> 00:06:57.949
we get four.

00:06:57.949 --> 00:07:00.457
Now, we're also gonna
have to add up all of,

00:07:00.457 --> 00:07:03.358
when you add up all of
these guys over here.

00:07:03.358 --> 00:07:04.427
Let me do this in a new color.

00:07:04.427 --> 00:07:07.933
When I add up all of these guys over here,

00:07:07.933 --> 00:07:11.695
it's going to be negative Z one plus Z two

00:07:11.695 --> 00:07:15.363
plus Z three plus Z four.

00:07:15.363 --> 00:07:18.010
Now, two videos ago, I think it was,

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.285
we show that the sum of
the roots of a polynomial,

00:07:20.285 --> 00:07:22.701
and this the sum of the roots of Q of X,

00:07:22.701 --> 00:07:25.742
that that is equal to the
negative of the coefficient

00:07:25.742 --> 00:07:28.319
on the second to highest degree term.

00:07:28.319 --> 00:07:30.409
Or, I should say that on the degree term

00:07:30.409 --> 00:07:32.174
that's one less than
the highest degree term.

00:07:32.174 --> 00:07:34.063
So if we go to Q of X,

00:07:34.063 --> 00:07:37.522
we go to Q of X, it's a
fourth degree polynomial.

00:07:37.522 --> 00:07:38.684
The sum of the roots,

00:07:38.684 --> 00:07:41.167
to find the sum of the roots we go

00:07:41.167 --> 00:07:42.329
one degree less than that,

00:07:42.329 --> 00:07:44.069
so we look for the third degree term,

00:07:44.069 --> 00:07:45.439
that's this over here.

00:07:45.439 --> 00:07:48.645
The coefficient on the
third degree term over here

00:07:48.645 --> 00:07:50.223
is negative one.

00:07:50.223 --> 00:07:51.965
It has a negative one coefficient,

00:07:51.965 --> 00:07:54.055
so the sum of the roots,

00:07:54.055 --> 00:07:55.146
the sum of the roots,

00:07:55.146 --> 00:07:56.511
this over here is going to be equal

00:07:56.511 --> 00:07:58.716
the negative of that coefficient.

00:07:58.716 --> 00:08:00.341
So negative negative one,

00:08:00.341 --> 00:08:02.617
so it's the negative of negative one,

00:08:02.617 --> 00:08:04.312
which is just plus one.

00:08:04.312 --> 00:08:06.239
And of course we have a
negative out front here,

00:08:06.239 --> 00:08:08.793
so this whole thing is going
to evaluate to negative one.

00:08:08.793 --> 00:08:13.437
So that whole business
evaluates to negative one.

00:08:13.437 --> 00:08:16.247
Now, we have to take
the sum of the squares,

00:08:16.247 --> 00:08:18.118
We have to do all of this over here.

00:08:19.190 --> 00:08:20.468
We have to do all of this over here.

00:08:20.468 --> 00:08:24.067
The sum of Z one squared
plus Z two squared

00:08:24.067 --> 00:08:28.339
plus Z three squared plus Z four squared.

00:08:28.339 --> 00:08:29.570
Now in the last video where I

00:08:29.570 --> 00:08:30.522
talk about the sum of the squares,

00:08:30.522 --> 00:08:32.101
I didn't prove it for
the fourth degree case.

00:08:32.101 --> 00:08:33.471
It's actually pretty
easy to extend it from

00:08:33.471 --> 00:08:35.607
the third degree case
that we did in that video

00:08:35.607 --> 00:08:37.302
to the fourth degree and it's little messy

00:08:37.302 --> 00:08:39.623
to do it generally do
the whole induction thing

00:08:39.623 --> 00:08:41.482
that I did with the straight up sum,

00:08:41.482 --> 00:08:42.726
not the sum of the squares.

00:08:43.405 --> 00:08:44.472
But hopefully you see,

00:08:44.472 --> 00:08:46.748
or at least you understood how to apply it

00:08:46.748 --> 00:08:48.792
and if you're interested,
you actually could extend it

00:08:48.792 --> 00:08:51.578
to the fourth power or to the nth power,

00:08:51.578 --> 00:08:55.246
but this is going to be
equal to the coefficient on,

00:08:55.246 --> 00:08:56.547
I should look at Q of X.

00:08:56.547 --> 00:09:00.401
The coefficient on the degree one less

00:09:00.401 --> 00:09:02.491
than the highest degree,
so it's going to be,

00:09:02.491 --> 00:09:03.790
so this is a negative one.

00:09:03.790 --> 00:09:07.599
So it's going to be equal
to negative one squared,

00:09:07.599 --> 00:09:11.198
negative one squared minus two times

00:09:11.198 --> 00:09:13.960
the coefficient on the degree below that.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:17.560
So minus two times the
coefficient over here.

00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:18.688
So over here,

00:09:19.436 --> 00:09:22.362
so we're looking, we
started at this degree,

00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:23.870
now we're going even one lower than that.

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:26.099
Two lower than the
degree of the polynomial.

00:09:26.099 --> 00:09:27.679
So we go to the X squared term.

00:09:27.679 --> 00:09:29.396
This coefficient is negative one.

00:09:29.396 --> 00:09:31.487
So minus two times negative one.

00:09:31.487 --> 00:09:33.584
This is equal to one,

00:09:34.343 --> 00:09:38.210
one plus two, which is equal to three.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.531
So this thing over here in green

00:09:40.531 --> 00:09:41.553
when you take the sum of the squares,

00:09:41.553 --> 00:09:43.667
it's equal to three.

00:09:43.667 --> 00:09:45.547
And so when you take the total sum

00:09:45.547 --> 00:09:49.888
of P evaluated at each of
those possibly complex numbers,

00:09:49.888 --> 00:09:54.008
we get three minus two
plus four is equal to six.

00:09:54.008 --> 00:09:55.257
And we're done.
