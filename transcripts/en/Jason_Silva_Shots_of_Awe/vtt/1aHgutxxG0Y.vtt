00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:18.690
So the question is, how
do you want to feel?

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.360
So I've become really
interested recently in this idea

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:24.110
of mediating experience.

00:00:24.110 --> 00:00:24.610
OK?

00:00:24.610 --> 00:00:27.720
Of directly engaging
the technical material

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.030
of subjectivity itself.

00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:32.750
Of employing
technologies of rhetoric,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.580
like language,
songs, storytelling,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.770
cinema to capture
and control attention

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.570
and thrust one's
subjectivity into a state

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:45.770
of deep immersion, absorption.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.390
A necessary precursor
for any kind

00:00:48.390 --> 00:00:52.350
of interpersonal persuasion
or transformation or education

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:55.620
to take place
within one's psyche.

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:58.140
Janet Murray and her book
"Hamlet on the Holodeck"

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.750
talks about the fact that,
as narrative beings, we

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:03.870
long to be immersed.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.280
We long to merge
with the narrative

00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:10.040
to obliterate all
sense of separation.

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:15.660
To be enveloped in the mediated
environment, the story world.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.270
We want to disappear and
come out on the other side.

00:01:19.270 --> 00:01:22.140
And she says, so
powerful is our desire

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:27.650
to be immersed that it's not
just that we suspend disbelief,

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:30.490
but that we actively
create belief.

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:33.580
Using our sophisticated
intelligence

00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.360
to reinforce our belief
in the story world

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:39.350
rather than to question it.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.420
We actively metabolize
belief and story.

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:46.950
Knowing this then, the
challenge for the artist,

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.130
as he constructs the
cultural technologies

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.600
of the 21st century and
our technological desire

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:56.180
to virtualize reality,
we should keep in mind

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.320
that we have this
immense opportunity

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.940
to artfully and
creatively construct

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:03.870
these subjective story worlds.

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:05.580
And thus the narratives
of the future

00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:07.440
have the potential to
literally transform

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:09.009
what it means to be human.

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:11.110
To employ landscapes of mind.

00:02:11.110 --> 00:02:15.380
And turn subjective
experience into a living,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:16.580
breathing painting.

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:20.180
A wake-walking lucid dream.

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:22.960
This is our opportunity.
