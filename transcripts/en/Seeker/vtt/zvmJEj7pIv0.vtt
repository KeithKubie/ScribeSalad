00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:04.930
Antiperspirant: it exists to make us smell
better, but a new study finds - the opposite

00:00:04.930 --> 00:00:10.049
is true. And it actually - makes us smell
worse!

00:00:10.049 --> 00:00:17.049
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews, and for most
of us - antiperspirant is as much a part of

00:00:18.350 --> 00:00:23.050
our daily routine, as brushing our teeth.
90% of Americans use some form of it every

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:27.230
single day - but what if it’s doing more
harm than good? Aside from all the potential

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:31.980
health side effects we hear about, could it
actually be making us smell WORSE? Well, according

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:36.140
to a new study published in the Archives of
Dermatological Research - that’s exactly

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:37.329
what it does.

00:00:37.329 --> 00:00:41.519
Before we get into this, let’s examine what
actually causes body odor. It all starts with

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:45.920
sweat. The sweat we secrete through our armpits,
contains lipids and amino acids - that get

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.850
broken down by bacteria, and that process
is what creates the distinctive body odor

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:51.620
smell.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:56.010
Deodorants contain antimicrobial agents that
kill off that bacteria, but they also contain

00:00:56.010 --> 00:01:01.170
chemicals that replace the bad odors with
good ones. Antiperspirants work the opposite

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:06.260
way, by physically plugging up our sweat glands
with aluminum-based compounds. So where deodorants

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:11.540
can only mask the smell, antiperspirants actually
prevent the sweat that causes it. Of course

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.720
most antiperspirants are also deodorants - so
as far as body odor goes, they’re effectively

00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:16.960
working double duty.

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:21.360
It seems too good to be true, and like most
things - it probably is. Messing with our

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.500
body’s natural composition of bacteria,
typically comes with side effects. So to test

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.370
how these products affect us, a team of researchers
at the University of Ghent in Belgium, asked

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:35.750
6 men and 2 women to stop using any kind of
deodorant and antiperspirant for an entire

00:01:35.750 --> 00:01:40.020
month. Specifically, 4 of the subjects stopped
using deodorant - and the other 4 stopped

00:01:40.020 --> 00:01:40.690
using antiperspirant.

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:45.700
As a control, they recruited another subject
who didn’t use either one regularly - and

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:49.290
asked them to start using deodorant for the
duration of the month.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:53.960
At several points, before, during, and after
the trial, researchers analyzed each subject’s

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.820
armpit bacteria - and found that switching
hygiene habits significantly altered the bacterial

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:04.560
communities of each and every person. Specifically,
they noticed one common trend among every

00:02:04.560 --> 00:02:09.239
subject: which is that antiperspirants led
to a clear increase of Actinobacteria.

00:02:09.239 --> 00:02:13.409
Actinobacteria is just one of many kinds of
bacteria living in the armpit, but it also

00:02:13.409 --> 00:02:17.879
happens to be the smelliest kind, and it’s
predominantly associated with BO. Meaning

00:02:17.879 --> 00:02:22.430
the very substance that’s supposed to prevent
body odor, is actually making us smell worse.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:24.629
Now, why on earth would something like this
happen?

00:02:24.629 --> 00:02:28.560
Well, the author of the study believes the
aluminum compounds in antiperspirant - are

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:33.310
killing off all of the good bacteria, and
allowing the bad, more smelly ones to dominate.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.999
Which explains why only antiperspirant is
to blame. By comparison, the study found that

00:02:37.999 --> 00:02:42.239
subjects who used deodorant - actually experienced
a decrease in Actinobacteria.

00:02:42.239 --> 00:02:46.719
So, what’s the take home message here? Should
we all just forgo antiperspirant, and start

00:02:46.719 --> 00:02:51.549
wearing deodorant instead? Well… yes and
no. In the long run, deodorant is probably

00:02:51.549 --> 00:02:56.079
better for you - but it still doesn’t address
the root cause of the issue, which is the

00:02:56.079 --> 00:03:00.879
bacteria that causes odors. All deodorant
does is mask them. So really, it’s the lesser

00:03:00.879 --> 00:03:04.060
of 2 evils. But there’s gotta be a better
solution out there, right?

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:09.430
Well, there is - and it’s exactly what the
author of this study is working on: armpit

00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:13.159
bacterial transplantation. It’s when you
take away the bad bacteria from someone with

00:03:13.159 --> 00:03:18.370
body odor - and replace it with the good bacteria
from a relative of that person, who doesn’t

00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:21.659
have body odor.
So far, they’ve tried it on over 15 people,

00:03:21.659 --> 00:03:25.669
and for most subjects - they say it brings
immediate improvement, that’s often times

00:03:25.669 --> 00:03:29.989
permanent. Obviously, a procedure like this
would be used for only the most extreme cases

00:03:29.989 --> 00:03:34.499
- but for now, it seems like a natural - and
more effective - alternative to deodorant

00:03:34.499 --> 00:03:37.349
and antiperspirant.
I’ll say this much - and it’s probably

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:42.529
TMI - but I stopped using antiperspirant regularly
a couple years ago - now I use it maybe 2,

00:03:42.529 --> 00:03:46.499
3 times a week - and I’ve actually noticed
that even though I sweat slightly less on

00:03:46.499 --> 00:03:51.840
the days I use it, I also smell more. So,
I’m not entirely convinced it’s really

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.029
done a whole lot to improve my life. That’s
just me though - I’m sure some of you out

00:03:55.029 --> 00:03:59.189
there do a lot more strenuous activities than
I, so maybe consult your significant other

00:03:59.189 --> 00:04:02.829
before you throw your deodorant in the trash.
It is a courtesy, after all.

Now to completely switch gears for a second,

00:04:04.799 --> 00:04:08.900
I wanna mention another show we have here
at Discovery, called TestTube - that’s hosted

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:14.459
by Trace and myself. It’s a daily show,
like Dnews - but geared towards current events.

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:18.419
Trace did an episode earlier this week on
why the US and China are investing so much

00:04:18.419 --> 00:04:22.770
money into Africa, and it’s a fascinating
angle on that whole discussion. So if you’re

00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:26.690
interested in learning more about that, just
head over to youtube.com/testtubenetwork - and

00:04:26.690 --> 00:04:29.120
you can watch all of our episodes in one neat
webpage.

00:04:29.120 --> 00:04:29.849
In the meantime, let us know in the comments
below, what you think of this study - and

00:04:29.849 --> 00:04:29.870
if you think you could survive without deodorant
or antiperspirant. Just try it for a week

00:04:29.870 --> 00:04:30.120
- you might be surprised! That’s it for
me, but thank you guys for watching!
