KNOX CITY GREYHOUNDS,

00:00:04.103 --> 00:00:06.906
IT'S TIME TO GET SERIOUS!

00:00:06.939 --> 00:00:09.442
THERE IS NOBODY BETTER!

00:00:09.475 --> 00:00:14.614
AND THERE IS NO OTHER HIGH
SCHOOL SIX-MAN FOOTBALL TEAM

00:00:14.647 --> 00:00:18.484
THAT IS HUNGRIER
THAN THESE GUYS!

00:00:18.517 --> 00:00:22.388
TYLYNNE EATON!

00:00:22.421 --> 00:00:25.558
HEATH HAM!

00:00:25.591 --> 00:00:30.663
JESUS RODRIGUEZ!

00:00:30.696 --> 00:00:33.032
PUT ON A HELMET!

00:00:33.065 --> 00:00:36.135
TIME TO GET PHYSICAL!

00:00:36.168 --> 00:00:41.040
IT'S TIME TO DOMINATE!

00:00:41.073 --> 00:00:43.609
[GROWLS]

00:00:43.642 --> 00:00:45.478
[SHOUTS INDISTINCTLY]

00:00:45.511 --> 00:00:47.480
WE ARE BY FAR

00:00:47.513 --> 00:00:54.353
THE ABSOLUTE NUMBER ONE BEST

00:00:54.386 --> 00:00:55.688
IN THE WORLD.

00:00:55.721 --> 00:00:57.123
IF HE LOOKS FAMILIAR,

00:00:57.156 --> 00:00:59.392
IT'S BECAUSE HE USED TO STAR
IN THAT SHOW<i> RUGRATS.</i>

00:00:59.425 --> 00:01:01.594
THAT'S CHAD, AND HE MAKES
MOTIVATIONAL VIDEOS

00:01:01.627 --> 00:01:04.130
TO FIRE UP HIS BELOVED
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL TEAM,

00:01:04.163 --> 00:01:05.698
THE KNOX CITY GREYHOUNDS,

00:01:05.731 --> 00:01:06.799
WHICH APPEARS TO BE

00:01:06.832 --> 00:01:09.368
IN A HIGH RADIATION AREA
OF TEXAS.

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:11.704
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL
IS A RELIGION IN TEXAS

00:01:11.737 --> 00:01:14.040
BECAUSE ANYTHING IS BETTER
THAN WATCHING TONY ROMO

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.509
[BLEEP] THE BED
SEASON AFTER SEASON.

00:01:16.542 --> 00:01:17.877
IF A HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAME

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.079
IS THE MOST INTERESTING THING
TO DO ON A FRIDAY NIGHT,

00:01:20.112 --> 00:01:22.515
YOU SHOULD BURN YOUR TOWN
TO THE GROUND.

00:01:22.548 --> 00:01:24.183
IT'S THE WORST VERSION
OF FOOTBALL.

00:01:24.216 --> 00:01:25.818
THE QUARTERBACKS
CAN'T THROW 10 YARDS,

00:01:25.851 --> 00:01:27.253
THE RUNNING BACKS ARE WHITE,

00:01:27.286 --> 00:01:28.754
AND THE ONLY ACTION
WORTH WATCHING

00:01:28.787 --> 00:01:30.890
IS HAPPENING
UNDERNEATH THE BLEACHERS.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.059
NO COUNTRY CARES MORE
ABOUT HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS

00:01:33.092 --> 00:01:34.327
THAN AMERICA.

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:35.995
THAT'S BECAUSE CARING
ABOUT OUR TEST SCORES

00:01:36.028 --> 00:01:37.730
WOULD BE A REAL DOWNER.

00:01:37.763 --> 00:01:39.165
I DIDN'T PLAY
HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL

00:01:39.198 --> 00:01:41.033
BECAUSE I DIDN'T HAVE
STUPID PARENTS.

00:01:41.066 --> 00:01:42.268
PRESIDENT OBAMA SAID

00:01:42.301 --> 00:01:44.403
HE WOULDN'T LET HIS CHILD
PLAY FOOTBALL,

00:01:44.436 --> 00:01:46.506
BUT IF THAT KID
HAD MICHELLE'S SHOULDERS,

00:01:46.539 --> 00:01:48.741
HE'D BE AN ABSOLUTE BEAST.

00:01:48.774 --> 00:01:50.109
THE TOOTH IS, I RESPECT

00:01:50.142 --> 00:01:53.012
CHAD'S DEEP, ALMOST UNNATURAL
LOVE OF THE GAME.

00:01:53.045 --> 00:01:55.681
THAT'S WHY I FLEW

[LAUGHS]

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.708 align:start size:47% position:53%
WELL, I AM NOW.

00:02:22.741 --> 00:02:24.744
- WHERE ARE YOU FROM, CHAD?
- I AM FROM KNOX CITY.

00:02:24.777 --> 00:02:26.746
- DID YOU GROW UP HERE?
- NO, I GREW UP IN HASKELL.

00:02:26.779 --> 00:02:28.047
- IN WHERE?
- HASKELL.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.782
- HASKELL.
- HASKELL, TEXAS.

00:02:29.815 --> 00:02:31.817
NOW EXPLAIN TO ME
THE DIFFERENCE

00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:34.053
BETWEEN 6-MAN
AND 11-MAN.

00:02:34.086 --> 00:02:35.788
SIX-MANS IS AT--

00:02:35.821 --> 00:02:39.425
IF YOU GET 45 POINTS
ON YOUR OPPONENT,

00:02:39.458 --> 00:02:40.426
THE GAME IS OVER.

00:02:40.459 --> 00:02:42.195 align:start size:75% position:25%
AND 11-MAN, YOU CAN GET,

00:02:42.228 --> 00:02:43.229 align:start size:66% position:34%

00:02:43.262 --> 00:02:44.397 align:start size:56% position:44%
IT DOESN'T MATTER.

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:45.765
DO THEY HAVE A FULL
CHEERLEADING SQUAD,

00:02:45.798 --> 00:02:47.300
OR IS IT A THREE-PERSON
CHEERLEADING SQUAD?

00:02:47.333 --> 00:02:48.768
- IT'S FULL.
- OKAY.

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:51.170
WHY DON'T YOU GIVE US ALL
A LITTLE HISTORY LESSON

00:02:51.203 --> 00:02:54.073
ABOUT KNOX CITY
AND THEIR RIVALRY GAME.

00:02:54.106 --> 00:02:56.842
THE THROCKMORTON GREYHOUNDS
AND KNOX CITY GREYHOUNDS

00:02:56.875 --> 00:02:58.144
ARE THE GREYHOUNDS.

00:02:58.177 --> 00:03:00.379
IT'S TWO DOGS, TWO BEASTS,

00:03:00.412 --> 00:03:02.348
GOING AGAINST EACH OTHER,

00:03:02.381 --> 00:03:06.586
AND IT IS PRIDE ON THE LINE
EVERY SINGLE TIME.

00:03:06.619 --> 00:03:08.287
AND KNOX CITY HAS GOTTEN CLOSE,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:12.191
BUT THEY'VE NEVER BEEN ABLE
TO BEAT THROCKMORTON.

00:03:12.224 --> 00:03:13.392
EVER.

00:03:13.425 --> 00:03:15.261
HOW MANY YEARS HAS THIS GAME
BEEN GOING ON?

00:03:15.294 --> 00:03:17.096
I'VE BEEN FOLLOWING IT
FOR THREE YEARS.

00:03:17.129 --> 00:03:18.664 align:end position:100%
IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR
A LOT LONGER THAN THAT.

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.700 align:start position:0%
SO IT'S BEEN GOING ON
LONGER THAN THREE YEARS.

00:03:20.733 --> 00:03:21.801 align:start size:75% position:25%
LONGER THAN THREE YEARS.

00:03:21.834 --> 00:03:23.035
SO TALK ABOUT
WHEN YOU STARTED MAKING

00:03:23.068 --> 00:03:24.604
THESE SHOUT-OUT VIDEOS.

00:03:24.637 --> 00:03:26.405
WHEN I MADE
THE SHOUT-OUT VIDEO,

00:03:26.438 --> 00:03:27.974 align:end position:100%
IT WAS A BIG, BIG,
BIG HIT.

00:03:28.007 --> 00:03:30.443
AND THE PLAYERS,
THEY LOVED IT.

00:03:30.476 --> 00:03:32.578
THEY WATCHED IT
SEVERAL, SEVERAL TIMES,

00:03:32.611 --> 00:03:35.214
AND THEY WERE MORE READY
THAN EVER THAT SEASON

00:03:35.247 --> 00:03:36.782
JUST BECAUSE OF THAT VIDEO.

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:39.385
SO YOU'RE SAYING THAT YOU HAD
A BIGGER INFLUENCE

00:03:39.418 --> 00:03:41.654
ON THE HIGH SCHOOL
FOOTBALL PROGRAM

00:03:41.687 --> 00:03:43.055
THAN PROBABLY THE COACHES.

00:03:43.088 --> 00:03:44.790
- FAIR?
- WELL, FAIR, YOU BET.

00:03:44.823 --> 00:03:47.360
HAS ANYBODY EVER DUMPED
GATORADE ON TOP OF YOU?

00:03:47.393 --> 00:03:50.396 align:start size:31% position:69%
NO, NEVER.

00:03:50.429 --> 00:03:51.530 align:start size:19% position:81%
NEVER.

00:03:51.563 --> 00:03:52.932
DID YOU PLAY ANY FOOTBALL?

00:03:52.965 --> 00:03:53.966
I NEARLY DID.

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:55.635
- YOU NEARLY DID.
- I NEARLY DID.

00:03:55.668 --> 00:03:57.570 align:end position:100%
AND THAT WASN'T
MY FAULT EITHER.

BECAUSE OF MY SHYNESS--

- YOU'RE SHY?
- I WAS SHY BACK THEN, YES.

00:04:11.917 --> 00:04:14.020
BUT I SUITED UP,

00:04:14.053 --> 00:04:16.088
AND THE COACH
TOOK ONE LOOK AT ME AND SAID,

00:04:16.121 --> 00:04:17.423
"NO,
YOU'RE NOT GONNA DO IT."

00:04:17.456 --> 00:04:19.091
- DID YOU GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL?
- NO.

00:04:19.124 --> 00:04:20.293

I'M TALKING ABOUT.

00:04:20.326 --> 00:04:21.594

EVER GO BACK TO THE SUPER BOWL?

00:04:37.643 --> 00:04:39.679

00:04:39.712 --> 00:04:43.582
