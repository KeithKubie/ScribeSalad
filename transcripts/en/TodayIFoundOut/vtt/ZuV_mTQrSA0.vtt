00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:16.800
In 1999, 37 year old Bill Morgan was a truck
driver living in a travel trailer in Australia.

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:21.800
That’s when disaster struck- while working,
he got in a pretty bad accident that he nonetheless

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:22.800
survived.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.740
However, medication he was given during his
recovery resulted in him having an extreme

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:30.661
allergic reaction that ultimately caused his
heart to stop.

00:00:30.661 --> 00:00:34.171
After being clinically dead for fourteen minutes,
they were able to get his heart going again.

00:00:34.171 --> 00:00:35.171
Sometimes with that span, the person may have
suffered brain damage and may even be essentially

00:00:35.171 --> 00:00:36.171
a vegetable, though there are many factors
involved as to whether that will be the case

00:00:36.171 --> 00:00:37.171
(more on this very soon in an upcoming article
from our resident writer who is also a paramedic).

00:00:37.171 --> 00:00:38.171
In Morgan’s case, it at first looked like
that might have happened.

00:00:38.171 --> 00:00:39.171
After they got his heart going again, he was
comatose and given how long he’d been clinically

00:00:39.171 --> 00:00:44.210
dead for, it was recommended twice that life
support be removed and he be allowed to die.

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:48.950
Nonetheless, after 12 days, he miraculously
came out of his coma and was, shockingly,

00:00:48.950 --> 00:00:53.680
completely fine, suffering no apparent brain
damage or other long term problems from the

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:54.680
event.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.490
Not being interested in driving truck anymore,
he then found a different job and- as near

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:03.210
death experiences are wont to do, it made
him reevaluate his life, including within

00:01:03.210 --> 00:01:07.030
a year making the decision to propose to Lisa
Wells, his long-time girlfriend.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:08.030
She accepted.

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:11.000
No doubt feeling pretty lucky not only to
be alive, but to have his girlfriend agree

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.899
to marry him, he bought a scratch lottery
ticket.

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:14.899
The result?

00:01:14.899 --> 00:01:23.140
He won a car worth about $17,000 Australian
(today about $23,903 US and $25,099 Australian).

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:26.540
Normally winning a car isn’t a big enough
story to get the media to pay attention to

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:30.710
you, but given that Morgan had recently been
clinically dead for 14 minutes, the local

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:33.100
Melbourne news decided to do a feature on
him.

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.810
In the process, they asked Morgan if he wouldn’t
mind buying another lotto ticket and then

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.549
scratching it off on camera for them, as a
sort of re-enactment of his winning scratch.

00:01:41.549 --> 00:01:42.889
He happily obliged.

00:01:42.889 --> 00:01:46.600
After scratching the ticket on camera, though,
he stopped, looked at the camera, and rather

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.810
than be excited and saying something like
“I just won a car” as part of the reenactment,

00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.409
he instead said “I just won $250,000.

00:01:53.409 --> 00:01:55.119
I’m not joking!”

00:01:55.119 --> 00:01:58.049
This was the jackpot for that particular scratch
lotto he was playing (today about $369,102

00:01:58.049 --> 00:01:59.049
Australian or $351,526 US ).

00:01:59.049 --> 00:02:03.240
Needless to say, the reporters on scene got
more than they bargained for during the reenactment,

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:06.700
as did Morgan, who immediately called his
fiancée to tell her the good news about his

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:24.689
win and that they would now be able to get
a house.
