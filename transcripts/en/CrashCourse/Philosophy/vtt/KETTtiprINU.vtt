00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:13.440
Let me tell you a story that is disturbing,
but true.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:19.980
In the year 2000, a 40 year old man was arrested for possessing child pornography, and molesting his 8 year old stepdaughter.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:28.060
The man had no previous history of pedophilia, and he said that he was baffled and dismayed by what appeared to be a sudden turn in his sexual behavior.

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.120
While he was awaiting his day in court, the
man began to complain of terrible headaches.

00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:38.540
A brain scan revealed a large tumor in his orbitofrontal cortex, the part of the brain known to control sexual impulse.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.900
The tumor was removed, and, it turned out,
so were his pedophilic impulses.

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:45.480
But about a year later, those impulses returned.

00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:48.000
Another scan revealed that the tumor had returned
as well.

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.660
So, a second surgery removed the tumor, and the pedophilic behavior diminished, this time for good.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:57.300
Now, here’s a question: Was that man’s
really horrible behavior a matter of free will?

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.600
Or was it determined – by what turned out
to be a medical condition?

00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:01.720
Or was it neither?

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:04.020
Could it even have been both?

00:01:04.020 --> 00:01:14.180
[Theme Music]

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:18.260
So far we’ve considered two metaphysical
positions regarding the freeness – or not

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.979
– of our actions: hard determinism and libertarian
free will.

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:26.360
If you’ve found both of them to be wanting,
well, compatibilism might just be for you.

00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:30.500
Compatibilists believe, somewhat like hard
determinists, that the universe operates with

00:01:30.509 --> 00:01:33.979
law-like order, and that the past determines
the future.

00:01:33.979 --> 00:01:37.659
But they also think there’s something different
about some human actions;

00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.660
that some of the actions we take really are
free.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:45.130
This view, known as soft determinism, says
that everything is actually determined,

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.980
but we can still call an action free when
the determination comes from within ourselves.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:54.540
It’s like the difference between someone being pushed off a diving board, as opposed to jumping.

00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:58.740
The result is the same – you end up in the water –
but it does look like the cause is different.

00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:03.120
In case 1, the cause is the pusher, while
in case 2, the cause is the jumper.

00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:08.540
Compatibilists say that in both cases, the action is determined – that is, it couldn’t not happen.

00:02:08.540 --> 00:02:15.940
But when the action of an agent is self-determined – or determined by causes internal to herself – the action should be considered free.

00:02:15.940 --> 00:02:19.400
This means that we might have moral responsibility
for our actions,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.000
since the determination for some of our acts
can come from us alone.

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.080
And this was something, you’ll recall, that
hard determinists seemed to have to give up.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:31.170
But, it’s unclear how meaningful moral responsibility
really is, in this view.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:36.960
After all, if we’re still determined, just by our own internal factors, then in what sense are we actually responsible?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.030
Which brings us back to the man with the brain
tumor.

00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:43.600
If a growth in your brain, which you have
no control over, causes you to have impulses

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:48.400
that you also have no control over – do
you act freely if you act on those urges?

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:54.420
Pedophilia-inducing brain tumors are, luckily, rare, but there are much more common cases that are similar.

00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:59.180
For example, should we hold people who suffer from severe mental illnesses responsible for their actions?

00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:02.860
After all, the causes of their actions are
internal to themselves.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:05.780
So a compatibilist might be inclined to say
that they’re free.

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:11.860
Yet it seems wrong to blame someone who’s in the grip of, say, hallucinations in the same way that we’d blame someone who’s not.

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.460
What about someone who becomes flirty after
a few drinks?

00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:17.450
Do we assign that behavior to the drinker,
or on the drinks?

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:21.980
The drinker’s actions are caused by factors
internal to themself – the alcohol, sure,

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.580
but also their body chemistry, how much they ate before drinking, and who knows how many other factors.

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:30.000
Last time, we learned about the Principle
of Alternate Possibilities, and the long-standing

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.660
belief that, in order for an action to be free, an agent has to have been able to do something other than what they’ve done.

00:03:35.660 --> 00:03:39.980
But contemporary American philosopher Harry
Frankfurt challenges this idea, by arguing

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:46.100
that an agent could, in some cases, be morally responsible for things he does, even when he couldn’t have done otherwise.

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:48.710
We call these situations Frankfurt Cases,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.510
which brings us to the Thought Bubble to explore
one in this week’s Flash Philosophy.

00:03:52.510 --> 00:03:56.520
Suppose there’s a fervent supporter of the
Democratic party, and he comes up with a crazy

00:03:56.530 --> 00:03:59.250
plan to make sure his party wins in the next
election.

00:03:59.250 --> 00:04:03.319
He decides to abduct voters and plant devices
in their brains –

00:04:03.319 --> 00:04:06.220
– something that, as far as I know, neither
party has tried yet!

00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:10.709
Now, these devices are designed to remain
dormant unless a voter is going to vote Republican,

00:04:10.709 --> 00:04:14.390
in which case it’ll activate, and compel
them to vote Democratic.

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:19.300
Now, suppose that you were one of the unlucky abductees, and you head to the polls with a device in your brain.

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:25.020
But, you’ve always been a lifelong Democrat, and device or no device, you have every intention of voting Democratic this time.

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:28.220
You enter the polling booth, vote a straight
Democratic ticket, and head home.

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:33.300
Since you never had any intention of doing anything other than voting Democratic, the device was never activated.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.689
However, if you had decided to vote Republican,
you would have been prevented from doing so.

00:04:37.689 --> 00:04:43.629
The Principle of Alternate Possibilities says you were not free in this case, because you couldn’t have done otherwise.

00:04:43.629 --> 00:04:47.520
Even if you’d tried to vote Republican you
would still have voted for Democrats.

00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:51.180
But, Frankfurt argues: You were still clearly
responsible for your vote.

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:56.020
You were responsible, because you did what you wanted to do, even though you could not have done otherwise.

00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:58.040
Thanks, Thought Bubble.
So what do you think?

00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:03.140
Not about the next election – I mean, can you be responsible without being able to do otherwise?

00:05:03.140 --> 00:05:06.020
If you wanted to watch Crash Course, and would’ve
watched it on your own,

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:10.600
but now it’s playing in class and you don’t actually have any choice, are you watching me freely?

00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:16.840
Frankfurt Cases play on an intuition that many of us share – the idea that you’re responsible for actions you’ve chosen.

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:20.919
And your choice needs to come from within
yourself, rather than from outside factors.

00:05:20.919 --> 00:05:25.090
But it’s unclear whether we can actually
separate internal factors from external ones.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:28.099
A group of friends pressuring you to get high
is an external factor,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:32.980
but your desire to conform, or maybe your desire not to care what others think of you, comes from within you.

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:34.080
Or does it?

00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:40.060
Isn’t your personality – and how you respond to different situations – shaped by your parents, and friends, and earlier experiences?

00:05:40.069 --> 00:05:44.169
Many think these kinds of examples reveal
deep problems with compatibilism.

00:05:44.169 --> 00:05:50.869
If we can’t separate internal and external causes, maybe the answer is to simply say that actions are “more or less free.”

00:05:50.869 --> 00:05:55.220
And how free they are depends on how many
internal factors are influencing us,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.160
and how many external, and how much control we really
have over what we do.

00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:03.120
This is the view taken by contemporary Canadian-American philosopher Patricia Churchland.

00:06:03.120 --> 00:06:10.200
Churchland points out that, as social animals, we can’t help but hold people accountable, and assign either praise or blame for their actions.

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:17.260
But it also makes sense to think about how much, or how little, someone is in control of their actions, when assigning praise or blame.

00:06:17.260 --> 00:06:21.280
After all, some actions are beyond our control,
like sneezing.

00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:24.840
So I won’t blame you for sneezing, because
you can’t really control that.

00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:30.620
But I definitely will blame you for sneezing on my lunch, because you do have control over where you sneeze.

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.160
Likewise, I might blame you less for rude behavior when you’ve been drinking, as opposed to when you’re sober,

00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.460
but I probably won’t let you completely off the hook, because, at least under normal circumstances, you had control over your decision to drink.

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:45.569
So, Churchland says, asking “Am I free?”
is really the wrong question.

00:06:45.569 --> 00:06:49.149
Instead, we should be asking, “How much
control do I have?”

00:06:49.149 --> 00:06:52.650
And the more control we have, the more responsibility
we also have.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:56.479
This view lets us keep what we know about
the deterministic nature of the universe,

00:06:56.479 --> 00:06:59.439
while also making sense of our subjective
feeling of freedom.

00:06:59.439 --> 00:07:02.659
So really, “feeling free” really just
means “having control”

00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:09.620
We know disturbances in the brain can undermine our control, from seizures and tics to the pedophilic impulses that developed in the brain tumor patient.

00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.740
But we also know that our brains can be trained to develop control over many aspects of our behavior.

00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.480
Like the way you used to just pee whenever your bladder was full, but now you’re able to control when and where you pee.

00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:21.140
Congratulations on that, by the way.

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:25.460
But this means that we can choose to develop stronger levels of control over many of our actions,

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:29.420
which is what we do when we work to break
a bad habit, or ingrain a good one.

00:07:29.420 --> 00:07:35.920
Now, libertarians will point out that being caused to do something by internal factors still keeps our actions from being truly free.

00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:41.920
These folks won’t be satisfied with Churchland’s answer, because it says that every one of our choices is still determined by something.

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.480
So we can’t ever make an undetermined choice.

00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:48.000
But today, whether determined or not, we talked
about compatibilism.

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.280
We considered whether our internally motivated actions can be understood as free in a deterministic world.

00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:55.300
We also talked about Frankfurt Cases.

00:07:55.300 --> 00:07:59.860
And we looked at Patricia Churchland’s rejection
of the free-or-not-free dichotomy and her

00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:03.240
focus on the amount of control we have over
our actions.

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:07.080
Next time we’re going to move into a new
unit, on the philosophy of language.
