community the question is simply what is
spin the speed is a quantum car of some

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:12.120
spin the speed is a quantum car of some
 

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:14.930
spin the speed is a quantum car of some
particle the electrons for example and

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
particle the electrons for example and
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.429
particle the electrons for example and
is predicted by quantum mechanics and if

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
is predicted by quantum mechanics and if

in physics can say that can imagine that

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:25.619
in physics can say that can imagine that
 

00:00:25.619 --> 00:00:31.070
in physics can say that can imagine that
the spin is related to some rotation of

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:31.080
the spin is related to some rotation of
 

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.709
the spin is related to some rotation of
the charge of the electron around some

00:00:33.709 --> 00:00:33.719
the charge of the electron around some
 

00:00:33.719 --> 00:00:39.709
the charge of the electron around some
axis and then to this orbital rotation

00:00:39.709 --> 00:00:39.719
axis and then to this orbital rotation
 

00:00:39.719 --> 00:00:45.110
axis and then to this orbital rotation
is associated a spin along the axis of

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:45.120
is associated a spin along the axis of
 

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:48.020
is associated a spin along the axis of
the rotation and also a magnetic moment

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:48.030
the rotation and also a magnetic moment
 

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:54.380
the rotation and also a magnetic moment
and the only difference that has to be

00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:54.390
and the only difference that has to be
 

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.250
and the only difference that has to be
understood is that this rotation must be

00:00:58.250 --> 00:00:58.260
understood is that this rotation must be
 

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.740
understood is that this rotation must be
quantify and throw also the orientation

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
quantify and throw also the orientation
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:06.019
quantify and throw also the orientation
of the spin in space is also quantified
