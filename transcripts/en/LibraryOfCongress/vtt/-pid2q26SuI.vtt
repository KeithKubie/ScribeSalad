00:00:00.040 --> 00:00:04.680
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.180
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:28.170
Welcome. Thank you for
joining us this evening

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.470
at the Library of Congress.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.770
My name is Nicholas Brown.

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:32.070
I'm a music specialist
and one of the producers

00:00:32.070 --> 00:00:34.170
of the Library's Concert Series.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:37.120
We're very pleased to have with
us tonight the Tallis Scholars

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.420
who don't need much
of an introduction

00:00:38.420 --> 00:00:40.180
because I'm sure we
all know how important

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:43.390
and significant their work has
been over the last several decades.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.730
And for you especially we have a
treat and that is their director

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.360
and founder, Peter Phillips,

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:51.790
who will be spending a few moments
preconcert with us here to talk

00:00:51.790 --> 00:00:55.400
about the work of the Tallis
Scholars, and we'll hopefully get

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:58.610
into some of their really
significant groundbreaking work

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:03.420
in the realm of recordings and also
developing their own record label,

00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:08.100
which is of course was very
novel back then, and now it seems

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:10.410
like everyone's copying you.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.850
So the basic format is we'll
spend some time chatting up here.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:16.930
I have some questions for
Peter and then we'll open it

00:01:16.930 --> 00:01:19.420
up to a Q and A towards the end.

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:22.890
And without further ado,
we will just jump into it.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.100
Peter, tonight is your debut
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.400
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: It is.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.700
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Which
is exciting for us

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.000
and hopefully exciting for you too.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.300
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:32.600
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: What has been
your experience of touring

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.690
in the United States over the
many tours that you've had?

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.300
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes,
well, this is our 68th tour

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.810
to North America but
basically to the US.

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.440
This is our 32nd concert in DC,
even though it's our first here.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:54.250
A lot of those were in the Foger
Shakespeare Library, actually.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:58.750
Quite a long time ago now.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:00.580
So I feel I know DC well.

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:02.830
But so the question
really, I suppose,

00:02:02.830 --> 00:02:04.400
is how have the audiences changed?

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:05.700
Is that --

00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:07.000
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Yes, sure.

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.300
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes.

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.600
I can't remember.

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:17.670
The first tour was in 1981 when
we were all very much younger.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.390
And I just don't remember
what the --

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.090 position:56%
I mean, there always seemed to be a
really enthusiastic response anyway,

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:29.720
that this music is much loved
here and treated with respect.

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.110
And that's always been the case.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.060
And I've been -- what
I've liked very much is

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.880
that I felt I had free range to
choose music that I wanted to do

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:42.670
and that you would like to
come and hear it basically.

00:02:42.670 --> 00:02:46.160
So I've experimented with
a lot of repertoire here,

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:50.410
whereas in other countries
I can't necessarily do that.

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:52.690
So thank you very much
for that opportunity,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.710
because one of the
delights for me is

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.970
that the Renaissance period is
actually a big period of music,

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:01.940
which a lot of people
don't know very well.

00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.850
And I've just really enjoyed
roaming through it, you know,

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:09.050
really without anyone
telling me not to or wish

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.700
that I was just doing the
Allegri Miserere in every concert

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.370
or I don't know whatever
-- you know.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:17.050
I mean, that does happen
in places but not here.

00:03:17.050 --> 00:03:18.760
So it's been great.

00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:20.060
It really has.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:23.050 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Have you seen the
demographics of the audiences change

00:03:23.050 --> 00:03:26.730
at all over the years,
maybe in specific cities?

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:32.940
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No, I
think when we -- I don't know.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.610
No, I think the average age
has remained very much the

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:37.910
same actually.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:41.290
I mean, children tend
not to come to this,

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:45.690
unless it's got a really
catchy Christmas title.

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.430
And then they're always
disappointed,

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.210
because we're not doing
what they expect.

00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:54.940 position:56%
So that's not really -- though I
have had children come up, you know,

00:03:54.940 --> 00:03:59.730
at the end, and they've sat there
silent for two hours, enthralled --

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.900
genuinely, I think, rather
than being told not to move.

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:11.860
Yes, I mean, but then I don't
know sort of up to sort of 30 --

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.640
not so many people, I think.

00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:16.580
But after that, I think -- I'd
say it's grouped in the 30s or 40,

00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.230
50 range probably and
has remained like that.

00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:22.630
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: In your current
and most recent tours of the US,

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:25.140
have you ended up in cities
that you had not performed

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:26.440
in before, or is it --

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:27.740
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: All the time.

00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.040
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh, really?

00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.340
How about on this tour?

00:04:30.340 --> 00:04:31.640
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well,

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.940
on this tour I've never
been to Harrisonburg.

00:04:32.940 --> 00:04:34.240
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Where is that?

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:35.600
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No idea.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.650
[ Laughter ]

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.200
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Sorry
for anyone from there.

00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.500
I'm from up north so --

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:45.750
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Every
tour there's somewhere.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:48.170
Laramie, Wyoming --
that's quite good.

00:04:48.170 --> 00:04:50.810
Yes. Makes you think.

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:53.070
Well, actually the problem with
Laramie, Wyoming is that it's

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:58.210 position:56%
so high up that we find it hard to
breathe properly when we're singing.

00:04:58.210 --> 00:05:02.360
Let alone conducting, certainly,
but [inaudible], anyway, I mean,

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.790
there are all -- lots of
different experiences, yeah.

00:05:05.790 --> 00:05:07.580
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Just
out of curiosity,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.850 position:56%
and this is going a bit far afield,
the different venues you perform in,

00:05:11.850 --> 00:05:14.150
in the UK and maybe
London specifically,

00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:18.020
what kinds of things do you
do differently to prepare

00:05:18.020 --> 00:05:19.750
for performances in
the different venues?

00:05:19.750 --> 00:05:24.670
For example, Wigmore Hall versus
Cadogan Hall versus Albert Hall,

00:05:24.670 --> 00:05:25.970
if you've had anything
there recently.

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:27.270
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: We have, yeah.

00:05:27.270 --> 00:05:30.660
Well, I mean, these are
vastly different venues.

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.100
And we really have to adapt
to a lot of different spaces.

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:38.110
And certainly the difference
between Cadogan Hall

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:41.170
and the Royal Albert Hall
-- I mean, you could --

00:05:41.170 --> 00:05:44.740
don't know how many Cadogan Halls
you can fit into the Albert Hall,

00:05:44.740 --> 00:05:46.990
but it must be sort of like 50.

00:05:46.990 --> 00:05:50.520
It's a sort of -- if you stand
on the stage there and you look

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.890
at the audience, they're
about half a mile away.

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.570
I mean, it's just incredible.

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.130
And there's nothing
you can do about it.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.680
I mean, you have to -- you can't --

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:01.770
if you over-sing, it's
not a good idea obviously.

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:06.020
If you panic, it's not a good idea.

00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.040
But I think just -- you
just do what you do.

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:11.610
There's nothing you can
do with the Albert Hall.

00:06:11.610 --> 00:06:15.200 position:56%
The audience have to get used to how
far away they are from the stage,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.990
that's basically what it is.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:20.700
Whereas in Cadogan Hall, the
danger is that it's going

00:06:20.700 --> 00:06:24.360
to be too loud for everybody.

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:27.090
So we have to sort
of tailor down a bit.

00:06:27.090 --> 00:06:29.430
But then there are those -- I
mean, there's also the difference

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.220
in acoustical properties.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:34.540
I mean, there are buildings like
cathedral buildings which tend

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:38.730 position:56%
to have quite a lot of reverberation
but it's sort of not localized.

00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:40.030
It's sort of all round.

00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:43.890
So in those buildings,
we can relax in the sense

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:46.920 position:56%
that that the building will probably
take the sound and round it.

00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:49.940
So it makes our lives
a little bit easier.

00:06:49.940 --> 00:06:51.830
But they also make our
lives more difficult

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:54.640
in that we can't hear
each other so well.

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.190
So the ensemble gets a bit
more difficult to control,

00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:01.560
and I have to be very, very
precise with where the beat is,

00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:04.720
because that's when
people get lost, basically.

00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.060
And then there are those buildings

00:07:06.060 --> 00:07:08.140
that are huge buildings
but totally dry.

00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:11.330
I mean, bone dry, you
know, there's nothing.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:13.860
The sound stops in your throat.

00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:15.370
Those are awful places.

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:19.320
But I mean, they can
be secular or sacred.

00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:22.190
In our experience, there's
not much difference.

00:07:22.190 --> 00:07:24.950
And people who say to us, "You
should always do this music

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:28.570
in a sacred space," I don't
agree with them, necessarily.

00:07:28.570 --> 00:07:31.060
I mean, there are fantastic
symphony halls built

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:34.850
to very modern specifications
of acoustical clarity --

00:07:34.850 --> 00:07:36.290
like the Birmingham Symphony Hall,

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:37.800
where we're singing
this time next week --

00:07:37.800 --> 00:07:40.940 position:56%
which are just fantastic to sing in.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:44.010
They're so encouraging
and beautifully laid

00:07:44.010 --> 00:07:47.510
out to the audience, so that
audience are comfortable too --

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:50.890
not always the case in cathedrals.

00:07:50.890 --> 00:07:52.190
I don't know.

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:53.490 position:56%
Everyone has their own take on that.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:07:54.790
Yeah.

00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:56.610
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Could you tell us
a bit about the founding of Gimell

00:07:56.610 --> 00:07:59.760
and also maybe what
some of your goals were

00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.060
and if those goals
have been achieved

00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:03.370
over the course of its longevity?

00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:05.450
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes, certainly
the goals have been achieved

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:10.190
in that we've been able to just
record what we wanted to record

00:08:10.190 --> 00:08:15.380
and to experiment with repertoire
in a way that a big record label

00:08:15.380 --> 00:08:18.090
in the old days would never
have allowed us to do.

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:22.470
They would -- there wasn't
enough famous stuff basically.

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:27.820
So we -- I mean, the first
record we ever made was for EMI,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:29.120
and that had the Allegri on it.

00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.260
Well, you can't record the Allegri
over and over and over again,

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.060
obviously, because it's
diminishing returns.

00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.560
But with Gimell we were able to --

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:44.140
we sold enough copies right from
the start to finance, experiment;

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:48.480
we could experiment, take
risks, explore new music.

00:08:48.480 --> 00:08:49.890
And so, yes.

00:08:49.890 --> 00:08:54.230
And it started in 1980,
because nobody else wanted it.

00:08:54.230 --> 00:08:58.070
So I mean, actually we
did that EMI record,

00:08:58.070 --> 00:08:59.690 position:56%
and it was a great success actually.

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.350
But that was it.

00:09:02.350 --> 00:09:05.540
And we came up with another
idea and, no, it was no good.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:09.980
They had to sell thousands and
thousands of copies every day.

00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.830 position:56%
And of course, what we've done is
sell thousands -- tens of thousands,

00:09:13.830 --> 00:09:16.330
hundreds of thousands copies
of some of those discs

00:09:16.330 --> 00:09:18.220
over a period of 30 years.

00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:21.230
But the record -- the big record
companies never had the tolerance

00:09:21.230 --> 00:09:23.210
for that.

00:09:23.210 --> 00:09:25.230
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: What kind
of medium were you using?

00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:28.590
Were you originally with CDs
or had you started with vinyl?

00:09:28.590 --> 00:09:29.890
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No,
we started with vinyl.

00:09:29.890 --> 00:09:32.320
And it was very difficult.

00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.840
This was in 1980 to
about 1984 when vinyl --

00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.730
everyone had got enough
vinyls in their lives

00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:43.570
and in their houses actually,
because they're very heavy.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:46.930
And those shelves of vinyls.

00:09:46.930 --> 00:09:50.860 position:56%
I heard of people's floors
collapsing under the weight of them.

00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:54.890
Anyway by about 1982,
everyone had had enough of it.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.230
And then we made our first digital
recording which wasn't for CD,

00:09:59.230 --> 00:10:03.460
but the digits were
available in '83.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.070
And then the first CDs became --

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:09.500
were invented in '84,
I think it was.

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.460
And we were very quick onto them,
because we saw the potential.

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:16.720
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: And now in this
climate of digital streaming

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:21.920
and download and that kind of
business, how are you handling

00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.230
that from a business perspective?

00:10:23.230 --> 00:10:24.530
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: It's disastrous.

00:10:24.530 --> 00:10:28.330
I mean, people are not
buying CDs anymore.

00:10:28.330 --> 00:10:33.790
And there's nothing to
replace the income from CDs.

00:10:33.790 --> 00:10:38.410
Downloading is okay,
but it's not nearly

00:10:38.410 --> 00:10:43.060
as good; and also it's dying off.

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.130 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: I saw today the UK
numbers for November had vinyl sales

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:51.610
above digital downloads for
the first time, which is wild.

00:10:51.610 --> 00:10:52.910
Yeah.

00:10:52.910 --> 00:10:54.210
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: That is wild.

00:10:54.210 --> 00:10:56.580
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: And it was like a
four-fold increase in vinyl sales

00:10:56.580 --> 00:11:00.060
from one year ago, on a monthly
basis, which is pretty interesting.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:01.710
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: There are a lot
of people out there who would love

00:11:01.710 --> 00:11:04.360
to think that vinyl is coming back.

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:05.910
Maybe you're one of those.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:07.210
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: No, no, no, no, no.

00:11:07.210 --> 00:11:08.950
I have enough already.

00:11:08.950 --> 00:11:12.240
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: But, well,
the immediate problem is

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:13.540
that CDs are not selling.

00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:18.180
And the substitute that's
killed the CD market off used

00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:21.170
to be okay and is now also falling.

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:23.350
But streaming is the thing.

00:11:23.350 --> 00:11:26.290
So -- and we get almost
no revenue from it.

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:28.400
It's really serious.

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.250
But we simply have to change
the business model, I suppose.

00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:33.770
I mean, we can't pay
the fees to the singers

00:11:33.770 --> 00:11:36.480
or go to the interesting places
we used to go to, to record in,

00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.780
because we haven't got the money.

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:41.010
So we've got to find the
money from some other way.

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:44.460
And the symphony orchestras
are doing it by financing

00:11:44.460 --> 00:11:49.600 position:56%
from concert revenue, so the whole
thing is wrapped into one promotion.

00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.090
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Do you handle
distribution internally

00:11:52.090 --> 00:11:54.210
within Gimell, or do you
work with partners for that?

00:11:54.210 --> 00:11:58.220
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No, we work
entirely with Hyperion actually.

00:11:58.220 --> 00:12:00.000 position:56%
And in this country, Harmonia Mundi.

00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:02.880
But they also have
gone -- basically gone.

00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:06.150
You know, those record
shops have gone,

00:12:06.150 --> 00:12:08.770
the distributors are cracking up.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:10.690
It's a terrible scene out there.

00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.990
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: It is.

00:12:11.990 --> 00:12:13.290
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: It's not
the end of the world, though,

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:16.200
because I notice every
group is making records.

00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:18.510
I mean, there are more
records than ever.

00:12:18.510 --> 00:12:24.910 position:56%
No one's buying them, but groups
are making lots and lots of records.

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:28.380
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: We have a nuclear
bunker filled with them, so,

00:12:28.380 --> 00:12:34.180
out in Virginia, at our National
Audio/Visual Conservation Center,

00:12:34.180 --> 00:12:35.560
which is pretty interesting.

00:12:35.560 --> 00:12:40.930 position:56%
And another thing that you've been
focusing on lately is the Foundation

00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.540
at Merton College, Oxford.

00:12:42.540 --> 00:12:43.840
Could you tell us a bit about that?

00:12:43.840 --> 00:12:45.140
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes.

00:12:45.140 --> 00:12:47.110
This is a wonderful idea.

00:12:47.110 --> 00:12:50.780
Merton College, Oxford is
the oldest college in Oxford

00:12:50.780 --> 00:12:52.360
or Cambridge in its foundation.

00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:54.510
It was founded in 1264.

00:12:54.510 --> 00:12:59.390
And before that, it was clearly
a group of students there --

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:00.930
scholars, whatever you
want to call them --

00:13:00.930 --> 00:13:02.370
living in this sort of community.

00:13:02.370 --> 00:13:05.540
But that happened in
Oxford and Cambridge.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:08.890
But mostly earliest in Oxford.

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:12.800
And the buildings that are there
for Merton are the early sort

00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:15.130
of -- what do you call it?

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.700
Communal buildings for a
properly founded college.

00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:20.290
The chapel was started in 1264.

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:22.340
And it was just a fantastic chapel.

00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:24.580
I mean, it's the size
of a small cathedral.

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.250
It's architecturally
completely unspoiled,

00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.180
and there was no choral foundation.

00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:33.330
The choral foundations in
Oxford and Cambridge came later.

00:13:33.330 --> 00:13:36.780
They all came in the
14th and 15th centuries.

00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:39.580
And we're talking about
the 13th here.

00:13:39.580 --> 00:13:41.660
So anyway, I said --
and wonderful sound.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.010
We'd been recording in
there for many years.

00:13:44.010 --> 00:13:47.850
I said to the warden, "Why is
there no choral foundation here?

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.470
It's just elementary."

00:13:49.470 --> 00:13:54.650 position:56%
And the warden said, "I don't know."

00:13:54.650 --> 00:13:55.950
So we worked on it.

00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:58.620
And we got the money together.

00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:01.090
One of your countrymen
helped us quite a bit.

00:14:01.090 --> 00:14:02.390
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh.

00:14:02.390 --> 00:14:03.700
Great. Wonderful.

00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:05.110
Had you been Director of Music

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.390
for a period already before
the establishment of the --

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.620
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No, I just
made records there for years.

00:14:09.620 --> 00:14:13.050
I mean, the history of that is that
we made records in Merton in the --

00:14:13.050 --> 00:14:15.860
when we started in the
'70s and early '80s.

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:17.830
We then got noisy or
-- I can't remember.

00:14:17.830 --> 00:14:20.110
We went to the countryside
when we could afford to.

00:14:20.110 --> 00:14:21.990
We went to a lovely church
in the middle of nowhere

00:14:21.990 --> 00:14:24.190
in Norfolk and made records there.

00:14:24.190 --> 00:14:25.590
That was lovely.

00:14:25.590 --> 00:14:29.350
Then we couldn't afford it
anymore, so we went back to Oxford.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:30.650
It's as simple as that.

00:14:30.650 --> 00:14:34.060
And it was while we were doing
the second spate of recordings

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:39.330
that I worked out this question
about a choral foundation.

00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:41.460
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Is it
a mixed voice choir?

00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.760
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes.

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:46.230
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: How do you approach
conducting the younger singers

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:49.140
versus your professional singers?

00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:50.640
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips:
Well, it's difficult.

00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.090
I find conducting inexperienced
singers quite difficult.

00:14:56.090 --> 00:14:58.940
Well, I think they find it quite
difficult to follow me actually.

00:14:58.940 --> 00:15:00.600
I don't have an orchestral beat.

00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:02.140
I've never conducted an orchestra.

00:15:02.140 --> 00:15:04.100
So you know that sort

00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:07.010
of more orchestral conductor,
all that kind of thing.

00:15:07.010 --> 00:15:10.010
It's not quite right for the music
I do with professional singers,

00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.300
which is polyphonic
music, as you know.

00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:16.410
And [inaudible], as you can see
from those scores right there.

00:15:16.410 --> 00:15:19.670
And so it's much more appropriate
to conduct it sort of sweeping

00:15:19.670 --> 00:15:22.800
through without doing
this heavy downbeat,

00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.120
which is what inexperienced
people need.

00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:29.220
They need to know where
the bar starts.

00:15:29.220 --> 00:15:30.520
Well, that's the problem.

00:15:30.520 --> 00:15:33.630
So I've had to sort
of work on that a bit.

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:38.410 position:56%
The other thing about Merton is that
the -- it's got tremendous acoustics

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:40.050
and the distances are quite wide.

00:15:40.050 --> 00:15:41.610
It's quite a wide chapel.

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.810
So I'm standing here, and
some of them are over there.

00:15:44.810 --> 00:15:49.650
And I have to sort of
-- that kind of thing.

00:15:49.650 --> 00:15:50.950
Yeah.

00:15:50.950 --> 00:15:52.250
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: You are in
the process of recording all

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:54.760
of the Josquin Masses, and
you've just released the sixth

00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:57.080
of nine recordings, and
the last one will be

00:15:57.080 --> 00:15:59.230
out in 2020, 2021, is that correct?

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:00.530 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: You're very good.

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.830
Yes. That's right.

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:04.250
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: I do work
in a library, after all.

00:16:04.250 --> 00:16:05.950
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: He's good.

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:07.960
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: I remember
them, though.

00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:11.680 position:56%
What has the experience been like
of recording all the Josquin Masses?

00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:12.980
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well, it's true.

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:15.240
There are 19 of them --
well, there are 18 of them

00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.600
with an optional 19th,
which probably isn't by him,

00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:19.900
but it's an interesting piece.

00:16:19.900 --> 00:16:23.090
And it makes up the last
record quite neatly.

00:16:23.090 --> 00:16:26.150
So we're going to do 19
masses in this series.

00:16:26.150 --> 00:16:30.030
And we've actually released
-- so it's nine discs:

00:16:30.030 --> 00:16:33.730
two masses to a disc
and one that has three.

00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.010
And so we're going to release --
we've released six of the nine.

00:16:38.010 --> 00:16:41.370
And we've recorded the next
two, and we've got the last one

00:16:41.370 --> 00:16:45.720
to do this month, right
at the end of the year.

00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:47.590
And then we have to edit them.

00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:51.220
And the thing about this
is Josquin died in 1521,

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:54.020
and I'm hoping this will
be really a big year

00:16:54.020 --> 00:16:57.960
for us all to celebrate him.

00:16:57.960 --> 00:17:04.250
And I want this set of discs
out by 2020 so that we can say

00:17:04.250 --> 00:17:07.730
that they're there already
right at the start of the year.

00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.890
And also plan a worldwide tour

00:17:11.890 --> 00:17:15.530
of all these masses
in different places.

00:17:15.530 --> 00:17:17.980
So I don't know, we're
probably go to Japan that year.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:19.280
They'll have two of them.

00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:23.370
We'll come here, you know,
twice at least, so do some here.

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:28.860
So we cover the whole 19 around the
world and we make a noise about it.

00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.510
We make a brochure and
all that kind of thing.

00:17:31.510 --> 00:17:33.080
And you know, it looks exciting.

00:17:33.080 --> 00:17:36.430
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Are there any
specific interpretational issues

00:17:36.430 --> 00:17:41.700
that you are focusing on as
you go through this cycle?

00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:43.810
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well, Josquin
is a very subtle composer,

00:17:43.810 --> 00:17:48.890
and he's not someone whose style
you can suddenly say that's

00:17:48.890 --> 00:17:50.770
definitely him.

00:17:50.770 --> 00:17:52.640
He's quite experimental.

00:17:52.640 --> 00:17:57.230
And that means it's difficult just
to say he should be done like this.

00:17:57.230 --> 00:18:02.460 position:56%
And I think that's underplaying him
anyway, to turn him into Palestrina,

00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:06.230
for example, who does have the same
style, more or less consistently,

00:18:06.230 --> 00:18:07.920
and there are merits in that.

00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:09.700
I love Palestrina's music.

00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:13.790
But Josquin is much more difficult
to -- just to say, "Okay, yep."

00:18:13.790 --> 00:18:17.160
So, and one -- and he poses
real technical problems.

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:20.980
This is one of his things --
he writes ranges of voice --

00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:23.780
voice ranges that go two octaves,

00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:28.690
and modern singers are not
trained to singing like that.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:35.620
A tenor, so called, has a specific
range when you're learning tenor.

00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:40.310
And these parts just
wander all over the place.

00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:44.080
And we rather like a balanced,

00:18:44.080 --> 00:18:46.790
blended sound, from
top to bottom, up.

00:18:46.790 --> 00:18:49.280
It's quite possible that
Josquin didn't expect anything

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.990
of the kind that we like.

00:18:51.990 --> 00:18:54.460
But I want to do it my way.

00:18:54.460 --> 00:18:57.470
And I'm not trying to impose -- I'm
not trying to take anything away

00:18:57.470 --> 00:18:59.940
from the music, but I'm
trying to impose a sound --

00:18:59.940 --> 00:19:02.780
trying to produce a sound
through it, if you like,

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:07.310
that we will collectively find
attractive and enable us to listen

00:19:07.310 --> 00:19:09.800
to the music with pleasure.

00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:13.890
What he heard in his
time, we will never know.

00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:17.780
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: For the
program this evening,

00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:23.170 position:56%
is there a specific thematic thread
or some kind of pacing consideration

00:19:23.170 --> 00:19:25.500 position:56%
that went into selecting the program

00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.380
and also the sequence
of the repertoire?

00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:29.700
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well,
this is a Christmas program.

00:19:29.700 --> 00:19:32.090
I'm always being asked to put
-- at this time of the year.

00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.610 position:56%
It's a bit of a challenge, actually.

00:19:33.610 --> 00:19:37.590
Because there isn't that much.

00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:41.680
The Christmas music is much
more sort of popular music.

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:47.090
Polyphony of the complicated
variety tended not

00:19:47.090 --> 00:19:48.510
to be written for cathedrals.

00:19:48.510 --> 00:19:52.090
It tended to be written
for courtly chapels,

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:54.980
much smaller buildings
than a huge cathedral.

00:19:54.980 --> 00:19:58.170
And so it gets rather
specialized and I --

00:19:58.170 --> 00:20:04.050
so what I do, I've resorted to
doing is finding appropriate texts

00:20:04.050 --> 00:20:06.680 position:56%
normally to do with the Virgin Mary.

00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:11.490
So there's the Salve, the
Ave Maria, the Magnificat,

00:20:11.490 --> 00:20:14.480
which is actually an Advent
text, but we're in Advent,

00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:17.750
because we always tour
in Advent, actually.

00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.750
This Christmas thing
starts quite early.

00:20:21.750 --> 00:20:23.140
You may have noticed.

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.860 position:56%
But Advent's rather a difficult --
I find Advent quite difficult to pin

00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:32.950
down conceptually, so -- but anyway
there are texts which go very well

00:20:32.950 --> 00:20:35.150
with Advent and the
Magnificat is one of them.

00:20:35.150 --> 00:20:37.240
So this evening, we're
singing a Magnificat.

00:20:37.240 --> 00:20:42.240
The Josquin Praeter Rerum
Seriem motet, which is the basis

00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:47.330
for the mass we're singing
is also a Christmas text --

00:20:47.330 --> 00:20:50.210
very mystical text, wonderful.

00:20:50.210 --> 00:20:52.880
So, but specifically Christmas.

00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:57.440
So it's not quite right
for Advent but, you know.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.640
You've got some --
in the second half,

00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.310 position:56%
you've got Hodie Christus Natus Est.

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.610
That's quite good.

00:21:04.610 --> 00:21:05.910
I mean, that's a giveaway.

00:21:05.910 --> 00:21:08.360
That's not -- yeah.

00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.530
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Is there anything
in particular in the comparison

00:21:11.530 --> 00:21:15.130 position:56%
of the two Salve Regina settings
that we should be listening out for?

00:21:15.130 --> 00:21:17.630
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well,
I have to tell you now --

00:21:17.630 --> 00:21:19.780
okay, here's a bit of a story.

00:21:19.780 --> 00:21:22.030
We're not singing the Salve
Regina by [inaudible].

00:21:22.030 --> 00:21:26.740
Can you recover from
your disappointment?

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:28.040
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Yes.

00:21:28.040 --> 00:21:29.340
Yes.

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:30.640
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips:
Thank you very much.

00:21:30.640 --> 00:21:32.530
Because it's just not
a very good piece.

00:21:32.530 --> 00:21:37.800
I'm sorry to put it like that,
but I take risks, you know,

00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:40.310
when I'm planning --
we've done an awful lot

00:21:40.310 --> 00:21:42.600 position:56%
of Christmas tours and I take risks.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:45.540
I say I love coming here in order
to experiment with repertoire,

00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:47.230
and that's absolutely true.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:48.640
And I don't know very
much about [inaudible].

00:21:48.640 --> 00:21:50.630
And I just thought, well,
there's a Salve Regina there.

00:21:50.630 --> 00:21:52.490
It looks really nice.

00:21:52.490 --> 00:21:56.660
And so I put it down
without ever having heard it.

00:21:56.660 --> 00:21:58.180
But I often do this.

00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:01.250
And these risks usually
come off really nicely.

00:22:01.250 --> 00:22:02.550
But not this time.

00:22:02.550 --> 00:22:03.850
I'm sorry.

00:22:03.850 --> 00:22:06.340
I mean, I could have saved it.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:10.540
It's too long, and it's not
very interesting, really.

00:22:10.540 --> 00:22:11.960
But I could have saved it.

00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.440
I think I could have saved it,
if there had been an edition

00:22:14.440 --> 00:22:16.490
of it which was reliable.

00:22:16.490 --> 00:22:20.040
But actually, the only edition
I could fine without going back

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.770
to the sources -- and I didn't
have time to do that -- is rubbish.

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:27.940
There are two moments which
you just can't sort out.

00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:30.160
I mean, we're quite
experienced amongst ourselves

00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:33.560
at rewriting these pieces of
music when they don't work

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.970
to our satisfaction, but this
time I just couldn't do it.

00:22:36.970 --> 00:22:38.840
And I just thought, no.

00:22:38.840 --> 00:22:41.690
No. Major mistake.

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:45.400
So we're going to sing a
setting of the Salve by Josquin.

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:47.940
So you know, I think
you've lucked out there.

00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:49.560
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wonderful.

00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.360
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: So
Josquin's going to replace that,

00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:53.880
and then the second piece
is by Hernando Franco,

00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.420
who's a Mexican composer.

00:22:57.420 --> 00:23:02.180 position:56%
Yeah. First-generation Renaissance
Mexican -- wonderful piece of music.

00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:03.620
That is really good.

00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.510
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Have you performed
his repertoire much before?

00:23:06.510 --> 00:23:08.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well, there isn't
-- I don't know very much about it.

00:23:08.570 --> 00:23:14.830
We've been to Mexico a few times
now, and we have been encouraged

00:23:14.830 --> 00:23:17.860
by the person who booked us
there to make a record of --

00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.510
to explore more about
Franco and Padilla,

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.710
who's the other great
Mexican composer.

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.150
We sing quite a lot
of Padilla, in fact.

00:23:25.150 --> 00:23:26.450
Not Franco.

00:23:26.450 --> 00:23:29.580
But I was really delighted
to find this man.

00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:31.500
But he's -- no, I hope so.

00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:34.170
You just got to, you know,
keep going long enough

00:23:34.170 --> 00:23:38.220 position:56%
to cover all these exciting things,
because there's all of Josquin to do

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.410
and then there's all that
English stuff and then there's,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:42.410
I don't know, the Portuguese.

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:44.040
There's so much to do.

00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.730
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Do you have
any specific recordings booked

00:23:45.730 --> 00:23:47.030
for after the Josquin?

00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:48.330
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No.

00:23:48.330 --> 00:23:50.000
There's a problem, a financial one.

00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:52.700
I mean, I just don't know
what's going to happen.

00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:56.380
We've got -- we put this money
aside to make the ninth disc.

00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:58.070
We can afford that.

00:23:58.070 --> 00:24:01.990
We then got to edit it, which costs
money and produce the, you know,

00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:03.920
the books, and if we're
going to do a proper CD,

00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.150
it's got to have a nice
booklet and all that.

00:24:07.150 --> 00:24:09.310
And then I just, I mean, as
things are going at the moment,

00:24:09.310 --> 00:24:12.160
I don't see how we're going to --
what we're going to do after that,

00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.710
in the format that we're
using at the moment.

00:24:14.710 --> 00:24:17.020
It's very disappointing.

00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:20.440 position:56%
I mean, what I would really -- okay,
well, I can answer the question.

00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:24.260
I mean, if I had the
money, I would do a record

00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:27.020
of the Eton Choirbook Repertoire.

00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:28.320
Does that mean anything to you?

00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:29.620
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Yes.

00:24:29.620 --> 00:24:30.920
Yeah.

00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:32.220
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yeah.

00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.210
The Eton Choirbook is a huge
manuscript that's very fortunately

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:38.430
-- it's not complete, but most of
it's there, in Eton College Chapel.

00:24:38.430 --> 00:24:41.750
It was composed for
that chapel in about --

00:24:41.750 --> 00:24:44.380
it would have wrapped up in 1502.

00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:48.780
The time that it was compiled
was about 1495 to 1502.

00:24:48.780 --> 00:24:50.420
And it contains a whole repertoire

00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.910
of extraordinary music --
very difficult to sing.

00:24:53.910 --> 00:24:56.030
Very few groups can
sing it, basically.

00:24:56.030 --> 00:25:01.680
So I would -- we hope we can, and
it would be great to have some

00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:03.900
of that stuff out of there.

00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.200
But it would cost.

00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:06.500
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Yeah.

00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.800
Do you have an American's
Friends group?

00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:09.100
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: No.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.400
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: You
might have members.

00:25:10.400 --> 00:25:15.020
Great. So I think we'll open it
up to questions, if that's okay.

00:25:15.020 --> 00:25:16.930
And if you have a question, just
stick your hand up in the air

00:25:16.930 --> 00:25:20.080
and my colleague Jay will bring
a microphone to you as we do want

00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:24.280
to record you for the
permanent archives.

00:25:25.890 --> 00:25:28.190
Select your wording accordingly.

00:25:29.990 --> 00:25:31.290
&gt;&gt; Thank you.

00:25:31.290 --> 00:25:35.170
I'm personally partial
to Josquin's motets.

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:42.090
Do you have any plans to, in a
more minor way, explore the motets

00:25:42.090 --> 00:25:47.380 position:56%
at the same time you're
celebrating the masses in 2020, '21?

00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:52.630 position:56%
I understand you don't have a
project to record all of the motets,

00:25:52.630 --> 00:25:54.440
but are you going to
be fitting in --

00:25:54.440 --> 00:25:59.150
helping people understand
his non-misa repertoire?

00:25:59.150 --> 00:26:00.890
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well,
yes, I hope so, very much.

00:26:00.890 --> 00:26:04.260
I mean, the thing about the
motets is they tend to be scored

00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.970
for more voices than the masses.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.660
One of the interesting
thing about the masses is

00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.830
that they're all scored
for four voices only.

00:26:10.830 --> 00:26:12.800
Whereas the bigger motets,
like the one you're going

00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:16.080
to hear this evening which is
in many ways the best of them.

00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.520 position:56%
This praeter rerum was -- this motet
that starts the concert tonight --

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.080
was incredibly influential
at the time.

00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:25.930
I'm sure you know it, if you're
a follower of the motets.

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.750
But it's got a sort of sonority
to it that's quite unique.

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:32.050
And a lot of the composers

00:26:32.050 --> 00:26:35.760
that follow Josquin
took it up as a model.

00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:37.390
Anyway, that doesn't
answer your question.

00:26:37.390 --> 00:26:41.060
I mean, we do this motet a lot,
and there are plenty of others,

00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:42.820
I've just put down
the Pater Noster --

00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.880
you know, the Lord's Prayer
-- for a concert next year.

00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.720
But there are many of them.

00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:50.840
Well, I just decided -- in fact,
the motets are more famous.

00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:56.250
What I've done all my career is try
to put forward really good pieces

00:26:56.250 --> 00:27:00.020
that nobody knew at the
time that we recorded them.

00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:04.530
And that's helped quite a number of
composers become fairly mainstream.

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:11.170
I could instance them,
but I -- anyway, yeah.

00:27:11.170 --> 00:27:17.750
So, but the motets are already
fairly well-established, so --

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:22.140
while not all of them, I agree,
and there are a lot of them,

00:27:22.140 --> 00:27:24.540 position:56%
I just had -- I can't do everything.

00:27:24.540 --> 00:27:28.770
So we decided we'd do
the masses, and oh,

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:30.590
I'd love to do some
motets with them.

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:35.460 position:56%
Josquin tended -- well, didn't base
his masses on any of his own motets.

00:27:35.460 --> 00:27:38.090
So we're not going to get
that little neat sandwich

00:27:38.090 --> 00:27:42.020
that you can get with some of
these composers, like Palestrina.

00:27:43.590 --> 00:27:47.940
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Next
question, in the back?

00:27:47.940 --> 00:27:50.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah, I know y'all
did the premier

00:27:50.550 --> 00:27:53.300
of Tavener's last piece,
the Requiem Fragments.

00:27:53.300 --> 00:27:54.600
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Oh, yes.

00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:55.900
&gt;&gt; Wonderful piece.

00:27:55.900 --> 00:27:58.770
Are there -- now that he's gone,
and y'all have had a long history

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:02.160
of performing his works, are there
other more contemporary composers

00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:06.010
that you're sort of trying to reach
for in the future, or that you say,

00:28:06.010 --> 00:28:08.360
"Well, my God, these guys --
people aren't really performing,

00:28:08.360 --> 00:28:11.490
and they really should
be performing"?

00:28:11.490 --> 00:28:12.790
Yeah, that sort of thing.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:14.200 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yeah, Nico Muhly.

00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:15.590
I don't know if you've
come across him.

00:28:15.590 --> 00:28:16.890
He's American.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:18.190
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Oh, yeah.

00:28:18.190 --> 00:28:19.490
We've commissioned him.

00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:20.790
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yeah.

00:28:20.790 --> 00:28:22.090
Hmm? Did you like the piece?

00:28:22.090 --> 00:28:23.390
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Yes.

00:28:23.390 --> 00:28:24.690
It was called Compare Notes,
and it was for Daniel Hope

00:28:24.690 --> 00:28:25.990
and Jeffrey Kahane, a violin piece.

00:28:25.990 --> 00:28:28.600
And then we got the
choir from Temple Church

00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:30.970
in London do his Magna Carta piece,

00:28:30.970 --> 00:28:34.540
when the Lincoln Cathedral
copy came here, two years ago.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:35.840
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Terrific.

00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:37.480
Well, there you go.

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:41.570
So the Lincoln Center commissioned
Nico Muhly to write us a set

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:45.980
of lamentations, which he did.

00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:48.750
And I think it's absolutely
fantastic.

00:28:48.750 --> 00:28:51.640
We've just been on
a tour of Australia,

00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:53.750
and we sang it every night.

00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:57.680
So we really know these
lamentations by Nico really well.

00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:00.950
And it goes -- it fits
very well with, you know,

00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:06.620 position:56%
the Renaissance settings; the Tallis
in particular we did alongside it.

00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:11.880
And it makes such as exciting -- if
the modern composers got it right,

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.420
as Avo Part does, the
music matches up so --

00:29:16.420 --> 00:29:19.570
if it could be made to match up,
in the way that Part does it,

00:29:19.570 --> 00:29:23.250
with Renaissance style, then we
have a fantastic half of a concert,

00:29:23.250 --> 00:29:25.460
where we can just make
these comparisons

00:29:25.460 --> 00:29:26.760
and I find them thrilling.

00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:29.170
And I think they've
gone down very well.

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:33.030
So I'm hoping Nico -- I think the
Lincoln Center are going to ask him

00:29:33.030 --> 00:29:36.390
to write a follow-up, so
I look forward to that.

00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:39.830
I mean, so the answer is
Arvo Part we sing a lot.

00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:41.650
But he's now, won't write anymore.

00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:44.930
He's 81. So I'm afraid that's that.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:47.760
And Tavener's dead,
and there's Nico.

00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:49.590
There's Eric Whitacre.

00:29:49.590 --> 00:29:50.890
He wrote us a piece.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:53.200
He was very, very good about that.

00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:54.650
I like that piece.

00:29:54.650 --> 00:29:58.530
He's very careful in the way he
wrote it, specifically for us.

00:29:58.530 --> 00:30:00.890
There's Gabriel Jackson
we've commissioned.

00:30:00.890 --> 00:30:04.900
Quite a few.

00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:06.200
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Great.

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:07.890
Next question?

00:30:07.890 --> 00:30:10.690
&gt;&gt; This is really a
question out of ignorance.

00:30:10.690 --> 00:30:15.980
But I wonder if over time --
say, the last 30 or 40 years --

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:20.220
research has revealed anything
that might have changed things

00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.950
in your performance practices?

00:30:22.950 --> 00:30:26.280
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips:
Well, that's -- yeah.

00:30:29.870 --> 00:30:36.240
If the scholars had been able to
find good evidence of how they sang

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.490
in those days, that would
be very interesting.

00:30:41.490 --> 00:30:45.470
Because then we would know
whether we were on the --

00:30:45.470 --> 00:30:50.250
the early instrument thing was,
the whole thing was that they --

00:30:50.250 --> 00:30:53.570
the instruments they found were
what the composer was writing for.

00:30:53.570 --> 00:30:55.740
So you're then able
to produce the sound

00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:59.450
that the composer actually wrote
for, in those early orchestras

00:30:59.450 --> 00:31:01.700
or whatever those instruments
were playing.

00:31:01.700 --> 00:31:03.000
So the instruments are there.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:05.820 position:56%
You can play them and get the sound.

00:31:05.820 --> 00:31:08.440
We can't do that with our thing.

00:31:08.440 --> 00:31:12.050
So I'm left, I mean, in a rather
fortunate but ambiguous position

00:31:12.050 --> 00:31:18.370
of guessing and trying to make the
music come alive for today, for us.

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:21.850
And the scholars can't
tell me that I'm wrong,

00:31:21.850 --> 00:31:24.560
but they certainly can't
tell me I'm right either.

00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:27.270
And then there's the question of --

00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.180
I mean, the scholarly arguments

00:31:30.180 --> 00:31:33.630
about speeds, pitch,
fixta [phonetic].

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:35.940
I don't know if this means anything
to you, but I mean, there --

00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:37.410
but these arguments never change.

00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:39.300
I mean, in the 40 years
I've been going,

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.820
I haven't heard -- I
mean, they had fads.

00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:43.760
You know, there were
fads of pronunciation.

00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:46.140
Latin was always --
suddenly about 30 years ago,

00:31:46.140 --> 00:31:48.030
Latin had to be pronounced
in the tradition

00:31:48.030 --> 00:31:49.670
that the composer came from.

00:31:49.670 --> 00:31:52.750
So we suddenly had German
Latin, French Latin.

00:31:52.750 --> 00:31:56.720
That lasted about -- really
inconveniently for about six years.

00:31:56.720 --> 00:31:58.020
Then it went away again.

00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:00.730
We could go back to our
very happily Italian Latin,

00:32:00.730 --> 00:32:03.890
which comes so much more
naturally and stop --

00:32:03.890 --> 00:32:06.350
so I mean, there are
fads, and there are fads

00:32:06.350 --> 00:32:07.650
of fickter [phonetic] as well.

00:32:07.650 --> 00:32:10.500
You can make it sound -- sort
of pre-Raphaelite, if you like,

00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:14.550
by not pushing any of
the cadence fickters.

00:32:14.550 --> 00:32:18.010
The pitch sing has come and gone
a bit, as you probably know.

00:32:18.010 --> 00:32:20.850
The English tend to transpose up.

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.600
But that's sort of gone
again now, so it's settling

00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.230
down back towards written
pitch again.

00:32:26.230 --> 00:32:32.370
They don't know, and they argue
with each other all the time.

00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.950
So that -- what I have
to do in a rehearsal --

00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:37.080
you know, I've got an hour
to sort this thing out

00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:40.550
and get a performance
going for a big public --

00:32:40.550 --> 00:32:42.530
I'm just not going to
have academics arguing

00:32:42.530 --> 00:32:44.860
about it, just there and then.

00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:46.160
I mean, you have to
make a decision --

00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.680
this is how it's going
to be tonight.

00:32:47.680 --> 00:32:51.160 position:56%
Maybe not for the next, but
tonight, it's going to be like this.

00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.040
And it's usually --
someone always disagrees.

00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.970
And the last thing we want is
critics writing in big newspapers

00:32:57.970 --> 00:33:00.130
who are academics, because
they always have something

00:33:00.130 --> 00:33:02.420
to disagree with.

00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:04.720
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:33:16.430 --> 00:33:20.530
&gt;&gt; I don't think I can paraphrase
your first question to Peter,

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:23.770
but I'm wondering if, Peter, you
could elaborate a little bit more

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:29.840
on audiences around the world
and where you can do sort

00:33:29.840 --> 00:33:34.990
of maybe less experimental
things and why that is --

00:33:34.990 --> 00:33:37.460
whether it's a tradition,
cultural --

00:33:37.460 --> 00:33:38.760
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yeah.

00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:40.060
&gt;&gt; Why?

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:41.360
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Well,

00:33:41.360 --> 00:33:44.920
in the Western Christian
world, it's one thing.

00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:47.950
At least the Latin is
something that they know --

00:33:47.950 --> 00:33:50.880
you know, the audience knows
existed, and they have a sort

00:33:50.880 --> 00:33:54.160
of sense of where the
music has come from,

00:33:54.160 --> 00:33:57.870
what the Ave Maria text might mean
to people, that kind of thing.

00:33:57.870 --> 00:34:02.260
But we've recently sung
a lot in China and Japan.

00:34:02.260 --> 00:34:04.620
And then you're dealing
with a very different setup.

00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:07.710
And very different between
those two countries, in fact.

00:34:07.710 --> 00:34:10.630
The Japanese are extremely
knowledgeable about this music

00:34:10.630 --> 00:34:13.330
and sing it themselves quite a lot.

00:34:13.330 --> 00:34:15.560
But they're not very adventurous.

00:34:15.560 --> 00:34:17.980
So when we go to Japan, we tend

00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.680
to sing the same pieces
over and over again.

00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:22.630
I can't experiment very much there.

00:34:22.630 --> 00:34:25.860
I can slip in the odd --

00:34:25.860 --> 00:34:29.920
sort of oddball piece
that gets by the censor

00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:32.700
but it's really -- I'll tell you.

00:34:32.700 --> 00:34:38.030
It's the Victoria Requiem,
Palestrina's Missa Papae Marcelli,

00:34:38.030 --> 00:34:42.390
Josquin's Missa Pange
Lingua, Tallis's Lamentations,

00:34:42.390 --> 00:34:45.330
the Allegri Miserere
in every concert.

00:34:45.330 --> 00:34:50.180
I'm not exaggerating too much.

00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:54.680
Now, in China, they have no
knowledge at all, and they put us

00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:58.350
on in these symphony halls, which
it's important to them to fill.

00:34:58.350 --> 00:35:02.690
So it really is extraordinary
business.

00:35:02.690 --> 00:35:05.810
I mean, they don't
know what to ask for,

00:35:05.810 --> 00:35:09.010
so I try to put together a program
which will -- and then they say,

00:35:09.010 --> 00:35:11.090
"Well, could we have Greensleeves?"

00:35:11.090 --> 00:35:14.360
So I say, "Yep.

00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.260
Yes. You can have Greensleeves.

00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.220
The rest of the concert will be
more like what we normally do.

00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.520
But I'm sure -- " and
then they can come up --

00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:28.790
the Koreans are very good at
coming up with local folk songs

00:35:28.790 --> 00:35:31.820
that have been arranged
for SATB a cappella.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:34.980
And we sing those as encores.

00:35:34.980 --> 00:35:37.510
And that's the way the
concerts are sold, really,

00:35:37.510 --> 00:35:41.940
that we'll do our own thing and
that's potentially interesting,

00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:45.670
but at the end, they'll get
something they really know.

00:35:45.670 --> 00:35:49.460
And one occasion -- it wasn't
Greensleeves -- what's that?

00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:50.760
Amazing Grace.

00:35:50.760 --> 00:35:53.410
Yes. The audience sang it with us.

00:35:53.410 --> 00:35:56.130
I had to conduct the audience.

00:35:56.130 --> 00:36:00.670
You know, having previously
just sung Tallis's Lamentations

00:36:00.670 --> 00:36:03.450
or something, we then --
the thing turned into much

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:05.430
like a communal activity.

00:36:05.430 --> 00:36:09.510
And they loved it, and so,
yeah, we've been invited back.

00:36:09.510 --> 00:36:12.240
[ Laughter ]

00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.930
It's extraordinary.

00:36:13.930 --> 00:36:18.840
That doesn't wholly answer
the question but I think, yes,

00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.570
in the Western world -- in Italy,
they like Palestrina very much and,

00:36:24.570 --> 00:36:25.870
I mean, that's fine by me.

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:27.170
There's so much to do.

00:36:27.170 --> 00:36:29.730
I can do anything within
some sort of guidelines.

00:36:29.730 --> 00:36:33.190
And very often we're asked to sing
in festivals which have a theme.

00:36:33.190 --> 00:36:37.810
The theme might be a city,
like Venice or Vienna.

00:36:37.810 --> 00:36:40.910
And then I love planning
those programs.

00:36:40.910 --> 00:36:42.880
And then I can get
away with experiments,

00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.180
because it fits the theme.

00:36:46.690 --> 00:36:47.990
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Great.

00:36:47.990 --> 00:36:49.290
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yeah.

00:36:49.290 --> 00:36:50.590
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: What's the
oddest city that's had a theme?

00:36:50.590 --> 00:36:54.420
I know that was a bizarre question.

00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:55.720
I'm sorry.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.470
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: I wish
I could think of one.

00:36:57.470 --> 00:37:02.010
I mean, sometimes they have -- you
know, these directors of festivals,

00:37:02.010 --> 00:37:04.160
they come up with ideas
that's is important --

00:37:04.160 --> 00:37:05.510
you know, it's their job,
I suppose, where they have

00:37:05.510 --> 00:37:10.690
to have not just a theme of a city,
but you know, the dance of death

00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:14.210
or just dance, actually is one.

00:37:14.210 --> 00:37:15.510
I mean, we've had that recently,

00:37:15.510 --> 00:37:18.410
and I can't think of
them all now, but --

00:37:18.410 --> 00:37:19.710
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Very good.

00:37:19.710 --> 00:37:21.220
Will you be around for signing CDs?

00:37:21.220 --> 00:37:22.520
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes, I will.

00:37:22.520 --> 00:37:23.820
Yeah. I'll definitely be there.

00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:25.460
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So there
will be CDs on sale,

00:37:25.460 --> 00:37:26.760
and is your book going
to be available?

00:37:26.760 --> 00:37:28.060
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yes,
my book is available.

00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.410
If you're -- I mean, I'll
just mention this now.

00:37:29.410 --> 00:37:32.020
I've written a book which
describes just these questions,

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:35.350
actually of what it's like to go
around the world singing this music

00:37:35.350 --> 00:37:38.650
and who we sing it to, and
it's quite an interesting --

00:37:38.650 --> 00:37:40.570
well, I find it an
interesting story, anyway.

00:37:40.570 --> 00:37:42.560
I'm very happy -- I'd
love to sign a book.

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.860
Yeah.

00:37:43.860 --> 00:37:45.160
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Wonderful.

00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.460
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Yeah.

00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:47.760
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: So we're going

00:37:47.760 --> 00:37:49.060
to give Peter a break
now before the concert.

00:37:49.060 --> 00:37:50.360
But thank you all for listening
so committedly and intently

00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:51.850 position:56%
and for asking some great questions.

00:37:51.850 --> 00:37:55.910
Thank you, Peter, for
exchanging some ideas with us,

00:37:55.910 --> 00:37:57.950
and we hope this has
been fun for you.

00:37:57.950 --> 00:37:59.250
And we'll look forward
to hearing you

00:37:59.250 --> 00:38:00.760
and seeing you conduct
in a few moments.

00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.060
&gt;&gt; Peter Phillips: Exactly.

00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:03.360
Thank you very much.

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.990
&gt;&gt; Nick Brown: Thank you.

00:38:04.990 --> 00:38:08.650
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
