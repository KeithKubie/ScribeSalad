00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:18.820
PROFESSOR: So ours was a
little different-- well,

00:00:18.820 --> 00:00:20.861
it was actually very
different from everyone else

00:00:20.861 --> 00:00:24.450
because ours is in 2D, and
everyone else's is in 3D.

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.710
So all we have basically
is a background,

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:28.210
and then you have a canvas.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:29.050
AUDIENCE: Oh,

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:32.950
PROFESSOR: And what you can do
is-- if I can find the mouse--

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:38.320
you can paint on
here, for example.

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:42.370
And then, if you click on
eraser and then go over that,

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:43.180
you can erase it.

00:00:47.104 --> 00:00:48.520
The main part of
this was supposed

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:50.200
to be that it's supposed
to be able to connect

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:51.070
with the Kinect.

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:55.570
And if you-- for example,
you use your right hand

00:00:55.570 --> 00:00:59.050
to move the mouse like
they did, and then

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:00.849
if your left hand
goes up, it clicks

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:02.140
and then it's supposed to draw.

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:05.050
But the Kinect. would just
not connect with the thing

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:06.220
at all, for some reason.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.230
So we couldn't-- it
wouldn't detect motion,

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.750
so we couldn't get it to work.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.620
But essentially what
it does is if you

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:19.000
were to see when it's just
painting, it's creating a dot,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:19.780
right?

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:23.200
So what it's basically doing
is every time you click,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.080
it creates a dot-- and then, if
you do it like a fluid motion,

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.910
it creates a bunch of dots.

00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:31.470
For example, if you were
to draw a lot, it's--

00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:34.330
yeah, you see the dots.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:36.720
Down here we were
going to do colors,

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:38.910
but we couldn't get that far.

00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:42.060
But that's the basic project.

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.017
We were going to have something
where you could change

00:01:46.017 --> 00:01:48.100
the canvas, and then you
can change the background

00:01:48.100 --> 00:01:50.170
so it looks like you're
painting at the beach,

00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:51.500
or something like that--

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.930
and so, aesthetically pleasing.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:57.930
But this is as far as
we could get for now.
