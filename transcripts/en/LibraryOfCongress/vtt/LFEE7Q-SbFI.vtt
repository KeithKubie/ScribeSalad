&gt;&gt; Hello everyone.

00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:03.410
This is Kathy McGuigan from
the Library of Congress.

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:08.320 position:61%
I want to thank you for joining us this
afternoon for our very special session

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:13.730
on "Artful Thinking" from
Project Zero and linking it

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:16.900 position:72%
to visual images from the Library of Congress.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:21.620
We have with us Susan Santoli.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:25.660 position:56%
She is the Director of the Secondary
Social Studies Education Program

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.270
at the University of South Alabama.

00:00:28.270 --> 00:00:31.570
She teaches social studies
methods for secondary undergraduate

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.520
and graduate social studies
majors, as well as undergraduate

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.250 position:61%
and graduate courses across all majors.

She is a recipient of the "Teaching with
Primary Sources" grant which focused on training

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.640
of all entry education and
secondary social studies students

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.850
to use primary sources from
the Library of Congress.

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:56.090 position:69%
She is co-editor of a book chapter on visual
literacy, and has numerous journal articles

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:59.900
and presentations on integrating
primary sources.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:06.310 position:59%
Our associate Professor, Paige Vitulli
is the Director for the graduate P

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:14.060
to 12 Art Education program at
the University of South Alabama.

00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:16.800
She teaches arts education
for the early childhood

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.680 position:69%

as well as the newly awarded summer SEAM grants.

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.730 position:72%
Paige also teaches instructional design online
classes for the college's graduate programs.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:41.950
Her passions include; family,
art, traveling, photography,

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:46.780 position:69%
technology, gardening, hyaking, and cooking.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:50.800 position:58%
So, I want to thank our presenter's
and I want to thank our participants.

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:56.660 position:73%
I know that my mic was hot just a few minutes
ago, and I want to thank you for your patience.

00:01:56.660 --> 00:01:58.930 position:64%
We have a great program lined up for you,

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:02.970
and I'm going to turn things
over to Susan and Paige.

00:02:02.970 --> 00:02:04.740
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much Kathleen.

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.860 position:64%
This is actually Susan talking right now.

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.610 position:66%
We are welcoming you from Mobile,
Alabama, and we're excited to be with you,

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:14.580 position:66%
and to see how many different grade levels

00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:19.640
and different geographic areas
our participants are coming from.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.450 position:73%
Tonight, we want to share some activities with
you based on the Library of Congress resources,

00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:29.130 position:58%
that you can use with artful thinking
strategies; observing and describing;

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:30.950
investigating and questioning;

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.100
exploring perspectives/points
of view; and making connections.

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:40.410 position:70%
Some will be activities that you can do very
quickly, and then expand should you have time

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:43.480
to do that, and others will take
a little bit longer to implement.

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.990 position:61%
We've been introduced to you, but we've
included a little more information here

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:51.360 position:63%
as well, as well as our email addresses.

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:56.970 position:70%
We feel like we're great collaborators, as we
bring different perspectives to activities.

00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:00.520
Paige looks at things from
an artistic perspective,

00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:02.770 position:64%
and I use a social scientist perspective.

00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.040 position:70%
So, we feel like we have a really good blend.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:13.960 position:75%
&gt;&gt; Hi. This is Paige Vitulli, and I'm so
excited to speak today, and to share these ideas

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:18.610
with you, and get feedback from all
of you all over the United States.

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:22.370
I want to start with just
thinking about visual literacy,

00:03:22.370 --> 00:03:27.460
and what visual literacy is,
especially what it includes.

00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:33.150 position:66%
Basically, I like to remember that when
we think about visual literacy strategies,

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:40.280 position:59%
I think about Bloom's Taxonomy, and it
includes all of the levels of blooms.

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:46.820 position:59%
And, visual literacy products include,
but are not limited to; photographs,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:50.510
illustrations, maps, diagrams, ads.

00:03:50.510 --> 00:03:54.330
The works of art can be two
dimensional and three dimensional.

00:03:54.330 --> 00:03:58.260 position:72%
They can be moving, and it can be still media.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:06.670 position:73%
And, a very visually literate learner will take
in to consideration things like the context,

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:12.060
the culture, ethics, aesthetics,
and technical components.

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.370 position:67%
&gt;&gt; I asked my pre-service teachers how many

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:18.750
of them could read music, and
several raised their hands.

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.840 position:73%
We discussed how the word read is used here,
and in other ways when we use the word reading.

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:26.280
Reading a knitting a pattern,
reading graphs, or charts,

00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:32.570 position:70%
and how reading in these cases doesn't mean
text, but it definitely refers to a literacy.

00:04:32.570 --> 00:04:37.600 position:67%
So, when asking our students to analyze
images, we have to guide them in developing

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.210
that visual literacy just like
we would in textual literacy.

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:50.810 position:64%
&gt;&gt; So, what we're going to share with you
today, the thoughts, the strategies come

00:04:50.810 --> 00:04:57.720 position:64%
from Project Zero, and we think about not
only in and through the arts just as our,

00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:02.660
the researched activities
that Project Zero advocate.

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:05.080 position:66%
There are many research initiatives there.

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.630
Multiple intelligences.

00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.420
Things that can be learned.

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.550
There's a good "at play" project.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:16.130 position:59%
There's learning as a consequence of
thinking, and making learning visible.

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:19.360
So, one thing to think about
that Project zero emphasizes is,

00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:20.860 position:58%
how do we know students are learning,

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:27.340 position:63%
and what types of learning is much
relevant to our many different students.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:30.440
Specifically, Susan and I
look at artful thinking.

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.910 position:56%
It's one of the several programs at
Project Zero, and what we're talking

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:40.880 position:59%
about today is all linked by the theme
at artful thinking, visible thinking.

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:48.170 position:69%
One of the several projects visible thinking
has us look at the artful thinking pallet

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:49.860 position:56%
with the many thinking dispositions.

00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:56.020 position:66%
We're going to share four of the six with
you, and talk about the different examples

00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:59.620 position:73%
that we use and activities that we use as well.

00:05:59.620 --> 00:06:04.910 position:73%
The goal of this artful thinking program is to
help the students develop thinking dispositions

00:06:04.910 --> 00:06:07.650 position:63%
that support, again thoughtful learning.

00:06:07.650 --> 00:06:13.600
So, let's move to the four that
we're going to talk about today.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.780
Observe and describe.

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:16.990
Question and investigate.

00:06:16.990 --> 00:06:18.960
Explore viewpoints.

00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:20.390
Compare and connect.

00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:26.790 position:64%
I want to note, too, that these visual
thinking dispositions are not necessarily

00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:30.090
in the hierarchy that they
look like in this list.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:33.730 position:64%
So, we're going to progress through these
in this order, but this does not need

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.880 position:67%
to be strictly followed in your activities.

00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.380 position:73%
The pallet is [inaudible] and it just as a
paint pallet, it provides you with many colors,

00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:49.620 position:75%
or in this case, thinking dispositions or
strategies that you can choose that are relevant

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:52.910 position:58%
to your goals and to your objectives.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:55.560 position:66%
Okay, we're going to start with observing.

00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:58.880 position:73%
So, as we think about observing, it is sensing.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.420 position:56%
And, we want to start with observing
and not using words right away.

00:07:04.420 --> 00:07:08.440 position:66%
The ability to observe without evaluating.

00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.660 position:61%
Using observation without evaluating is
a really effective way to communicate.

00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:18.900
So, we work to encourage our
students to experience sense.

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:24.200 position:63%
They can use their senses like seeing,
you can think about what you might hear,

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:31.320 position:67%
what you might smell, what you might taste,
but experience this without the filters,

00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:35.970 position:63%
and subjective perception is emphasized.

00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:43.140
The next part of observe
and describe is describing.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.740 position:64%
So, this is where you're going to use
your words to represent what you observe.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:55.000 position:66%
So, we can relate this to basic scientific
observation, making observations,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.920 position:66%
of course, is a core skill of scientist's.

00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.220
So, we receive the information,
again, through our senses.

00:08:02.220 --> 00:08:04.840 position:73%
When we think about the formal analysis of art,

00:08:04.840 --> 00:08:09.330
I ask my art students to
look at the elements of art.

00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:15.830 position:75%
So, when you describe, one thing to look for
which you're going to be doing in just a minute,

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:17.490 position:56%
is to look for those seven elements.

00:08:17.490 --> 00:08:18.520
Look at the lines.

00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:19.730
Look at the shapes.

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:25.720
Look at the forms, the space, the
color, the value, and the texture.

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.370 position:69%
Also, of course, look at the subject matter.

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:35.940 position:72%
You may see people, animals, landforms, things
that are man-made, things that are natural.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:43.840
Now, this is where we want
you to start observing.

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.970 position:58%
We have provided an image, and in
this image, take a minute to observe.

00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:56.830
Use your sense of sight, and
think about what you see.

00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:03.690 position:56%
We'd like for you to share your
thoughts and type your observations.

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:10.750 position:58%
So, you can start describing what you
see in this visual representation.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:12.560
Make note of the features.

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:14.100
Look at the subject matter.

00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.020
Look at the elements of art.

00:09:16.020 --> 00:09:18.860
I see smoke.

00:09:18.860 --> 00:09:22.270 position:56%
Paul sees that they're sharing food.

00:09:22.270 --> 00:09:25.620
&gt;&gt; Or, burning eyes, that's
a good one [laughter].

00:09:25.620 --> 00:09:26.950
&gt;&gt; Terry sees bread.

00:09:26.950 --> 00:09:30.290
Bridgett sees an ocean.

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:31.660
Great observations.

00:09:31.660 --> 00:09:32.900
Keep describing.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.190
Keep looking.

00:09:35.190 --> 00:09:38.440
The act of sharing, Jennifer's.

00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:41.030
Lee sees Native people sitting.

00:09:41.030 --> 00:09:46.320 position:72%
Oh, Paul indicates that some are well-dressed.

00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.220
Ada sees a man with a gun.

00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:52.900 position:70%
I like the Liam counted eight men, two women.

00:09:52.900 --> 00:09:56.900 position:69%
Oh, Paul's already getting to the questions.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:10:00.390 position:61%
Is there a Minister in the black, left?

00:10:00.390 --> 00:10:06.990 position:63%
One thing that I focused on when I asked
my students to observe and to describe

00:10:06.990 --> 00:10:12.310 position:58%
which is very difficult for us to do,
is to not jump to in [inaudible] yet,

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:19.150
to really just observe and describe
what you see in the picture.

00:10:19.150 --> 00:10:20.850
A man with a beard.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:21.740
Lots of hands.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:28.420 position:64%
So, I'm going to ask you to think about
some questions as you continue to observe

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:32.080 position:72%
and describe, and read each other's responses.

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:36.170 position:59%
Did you observe and describe features?

00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:39.500 position:66%
Did you observe and describe similarities?

00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:41.250
And, differences?

00:10:41.250 --> 00:10:45.580 position:75%
Did you observe and describe the subject matter?

00:10:45.580 --> 00:10:48.850 position:70%
Also, are you looking at the elements of art?

00:10:48.850 --> 00:10:52.820
Are you looking at the lines,
and the colors, and the shapes?

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.280 position:56%
I see Samantha is already looking at
a variety of colors in the clothing.

00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:03.520 position:56%
Of course, having an image that's
not online makes that easier to see.

00:11:03.520 --> 00:11:09.510 position:75%
These are just some of the questions that I just
posed as you were participating, and still are,

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.490 position:56%
in this first level of the activity.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:19.650 position:69%
&gt;&gt; I think it's very hard too, when you have
some background knowledge about an image not

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:24.650
to launch past describing and go
right in to deferring, inferring,

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:27.470
and so I think that that's a
difficult thing for us to do,

00:11:27.470 --> 00:11:29.690 position:64%
and sometimes for students to do as well.

00:11:29.690 --> 00:11:31.540
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:11:31.540 --> 00:11:37.040 position:61%
So, some variations of this activity as
you continue to observe and describe,

00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:38.980 position:56%
I'm having so much fun reading this.

00:11:38.980 --> 00:11:41.610
Sarah, I like your question;
Is she handing out pancakes?

00:11:41.610 --> 00:11:48.370 position:66%
But, some variations include; filtering or
focusing on a specific part of the image.

00:11:48.370 --> 00:11:53.290
So, very often Susan and
I will start with one part

00:11:53.290 --> 00:11:56.970 position:69%
of the image and not share the entire image.

00:11:56.970 --> 00:12:02.800 position:67%
And, for, especially for our young students
that makes it not so overwhelming to see

00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:06.760
so much visually, and they
can just focus on a part.

00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:10.870 position:58%
They can also look at the whole thing
and then we can focus on the parts.

00:12:10.870 --> 00:12:14.970
So, we can part to whole, or
whole to part with this strategy.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:19.860 position:56%
So, you can begin with that very
zoomed in part, and ask the learners

00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:29.450 position:75%
to visually describe what they see, and then
you can add more visual information to the task.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:36.020 position:70%
This elaboration game requires you to ask
one student to describe what they see in part

00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:39.860 position:69%
of the image, and then progress to the next.

00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:45.110 position:70%
Additionally, the game can help student's use
more sophisticated descriptive vocabulary,

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.020 position:61%
because they're building on each other.

00:12:47.020 --> 00:12:53.540 position:69%
The collaboration and the building on ideas
increases that community, and that teamwork,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:57.240 position:66%
and it models the power of a group effort.

00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.960 position:75%
&gt;&gt; I don't know why, but when I do this
activity I really like going from part to whole,

00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:08.880 position:64%
and reviewing a little bit at a time,
and then having the students actually add

00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:13.270
to their observations as we widen.

00:13:13.270 --> 00:13:17.650
&gt;&gt; These are some pictures from a
classroom, and this is another way

00:13:17.650 --> 00:13:22.760 position:69%
that I facilitate this strategy of observing
and describing in the art classroom.

00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:25.350
I use a set of laminated
posters that I've collected

00:13:25.350 --> 00:13:28.710 position:64%
over the years, and we use post-it notes.

00:13:28.710 --> 00:13:33.780
I equip my students with a
pen and a stack of post-its.

00:13:33.780 --> 00:13:40.750 position:66%
I display about 10 to 30 posters of
various works of art, sometimes on tables,

00:13:40.750 --> 00:13:45.360 position:72%
sometimes we display them on the walls, and
the students are instructed to think of a word

00:13:45.360 --> 00:13:49.210
or a phrase to describe and
stick to each poster.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:54.060
They must respond to each work
of art without duplication.

00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:57.000 position:66%
So, they cannot duplicate their own words,

00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.480
or the words of their classmates
that are already on the posters.

00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:03.720
They walk around, and they're
allowed to talk if they talk

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:07.600
about their perceptions and
descriptions of the artwork.

00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:12.990 position:67%
This always generates many conversations,
and initial reactions to a number of works,

00:14:12.990 --> 00:14:15.360 position:58%
usually which are new to my students.

00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:22.140 position:70%
It includes vocabulary, they share their
multiple perceptions, and their descriptions.

00:14:22.140 --> 00:14:27.710 position:56%
Susan and I have even done this at a
visual literacy workshop with people

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.790
from all over the world in Ireland.

00:14:30.790 --> 00:14:37.090 position:64%
And, these are just some more ideas about
the describe it, post-it activity that is

00:14:37.090 --> 00:14:44.160 position:63%
so successful with students and having
them look and just observe and describe.

00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:50.620 position:67%
As you'll see in artful thinking at Project
Zero, very similar activities like colors,

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:54.560
lines, shapes, and looking at the
elements of art are advocated.

00:14:54.560 --> 00:15:01.590 position:70%
Looking 10 by two process is a great process
where you at an image quietly for 30 seconds,

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.240
list 10 words or phrases, so you're
brainstorming, and then repeat.

00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:12.700 position:70%
We also want to think about how we can do
this using all the fabulous technology tools.

00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:16.890 position:75%
As I talk about voice thread and padlet briefly,

00:15:16.890 --> 00:15:23.700 position:64%
I'd love for you to add what technology
resources that you might use on the chat.

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.670 position:66%
Because, I know there's so many out there.

00:15:25.670 --> 00:15:28.250 position:69%
It's hard to keep up with all the new tools.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:32.580 position:56%
But, a variation is to use voice
thread which is one of my favorites.

00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:37.610 position:63%
It's an online tool to share images, and
participate in the thinking strategies.

00:15:37.610 --> 00:15:41.270
You use your voice, you can
use video, you can use text,

00:15:41.270 --> 00:15:45.730
and a community of people can
respond in multiple modes.

00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:49.560
Padlet is another way to create
and collaborate in the world.

00:15:49.560 --> 00:15:51.650
It's used Internationally.

00:15:51.650 --> 00:15:58.170 position:59%
It's user friendly, and intuitive, and
it works with sight, sound, and touch.

00:15:58.170 --> 00:16:02.800
It's simple, and it's linking
really enhances collaboration.

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:10.540 position:69%
So, please keep adding to the chat any other
resources that you think would be useful

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:12.530 position:56%
for us to use with these strategies.

00:16:12.530 --> 00:16:17.510 position:73%
Okay, we're going to move to the next strategy.

00:16:17.510 --> 00:16:24.820 position:75%
So, after the strategy of observe and describe,
we're going to move to question and investigate.

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:32.220 position:67%
As I think about questioning, the questions
that I pose are teacher constructed.

00:16:32.220 --> 00:16:37.170
But, I like to start with
student constructed questions.

00:16:37.170 --> 00:16:40.090 position:63%
So, just yesterday, I did this in class,

00:16:40.090 --> 00:16:44.900 position:70%
I shared with a student Salvador Dolly's
persistence of memory, and if you're familiar

00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.290
with that work of art, you
can just imagine what kind

00:16:48.290 --> 00:16:52.470 position:70%
of questions the students had for the artist.

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:58.170 position:72%
So, I shared that work and my initial question
which is a question that want them to come

00:16:58.170 --> 00:17:02.670
up with is; if the artist or the
photographer were in the room,

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:05.640
what questions would you ask him?

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:11.960 position:75%
Teacher constructed questions, of course, help
us to scaffold their understanding and learning.

00:17:11.960 --> 00:17:16.100 position:73%
Many times, the students, of course, don't
know what they don't know, and we want to guide

00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:18.030 position:66%
that with a teacher constructed questions.

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:22.920 position:69%
And, the investigate part of that is how you
going to find the answers to your questions?

00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:27.580
The student generated, and the
teacher generated questions.

00:17:27.580 --> 00:17:31.330 position:56%
So, we investigate or carry out a
systematic inquiry to discover that.

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:32.900
That is our research.

00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:40.600 position:66%
So, let's get back to our image, and let's
imagine that the artist is in the room.

00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:47.180
What questions would you ask the
artist about this visual image?

00:17:47.180 --> 00:17:50.740 position:67%
So, please type your questions on the chat.

00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.330 position:72%
And, I know that some of you have already done
that in the previous observe and describe.

00:17:56.330 --> 00:17:58.110
&gt;&gt; Oh, Sarah, we love wordle.

00:17:58.110 --> 00:17:59.860
That's a whole nother presentation.

00:17:59.860 --> 00:18:04.820
We love wordle for so many reasons,
and use it for so many things.

00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:05.790
&gt;&gt; I like Patty's question.

00:18:05.790 --> 00:18:08.530 position:63%
Why did you choose purple for the dress?

00:18:08.530 --> 00:18:10.440
Ah, good question for an artist.

00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:13.650 position:63%
Were you actually there to observe that?

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:16.030
Very good question.

00:18:16.030 --> 00:18:19.260 position:56%
Why are the Native Americans seated?

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:20.670
&gt;&gt; And, why was it created.

00:18:20.670 --> 00:18:22.880 position:64%
That's always an important thing as well.

00:18:22.880 --> 00:18:29.860 position:73%
In fact, each Fall I do some activities dealing
with Thanksgiving, and I ask the students

00:18:29.860 --> 00:18:36.850
to compare this to primary sources
or other artistic representations

00:18:36.850 --> 00:18:41.390 position:67%
of the First Thanksgiving, and we always
look at the date that something was created

00:18:41.390 --> 00:18:46.110
and try to discuss how that might
have influenced the content.

00:18:46.110 --> 00:18:47.920
I think it certainly does here.

00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:50.590
&gt;&gt; I think Karen's questions
is always important.

00:18:50.590 --> 00:18:53.770
When did you paint this, and
that's getting back in the date?

00:18:53.770 --> 00:18:56.850
Right. Oh, I like Clarissia's.

00:18:56.850 --> 00:19:00.690
Why is there no eye contact
between the people in the scene?

00:19:00.690 --> 00:19:04.620 position:73%
Interesting, if you look at the line of vision.

00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:11.680 position:67%
And, what I like about having the students
generate questions, it causes us to go back

00:19:11.680 --> 00:19:14.330 position:61%
and look at the image with more detail.

00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:19.240 position:58%
And, of course, you can do this using
the technology, using white boards,

00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:24.760 position:58%
using the post-it notes, high-tech or
low-tech, and everything in between.

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:30.740 position:73%
Great, keep adding those questions, because I
look forward to going back and reviewing those.

00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:36.780 position:58%
The third strategy that we're going
to consider is, exploring viewpoints.

00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:39.810
So, as we explore viewpoints,
of course this is going

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:43.190
to require some analysis,
some higher-level thinking.

00:19:43.190 --> 00:19:45.380
Asking, what, where, when, and why.

00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:50.160 position:70%
It's a great place to add more visual images.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:55.200 position:67%
This is where you can add more primary
documents that are related, more artifacts,

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:59.540 position:58%
and as you might imagine, giving some
background knowledge which we have,

00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:05.410 position:67%
there are multiple versions and images
depicting similar events, such as this one.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:09.950 position:73%
Different people have different viewpoints
based on their knowledge, or lack of knowledge,

00:20:09.950 --> 00:20:13.690
and based on their experiences,
and then, artistic vision,

00:20:13.690 --> 00:20:18.840 position:67%
and that's a whole lesson upon itself in my
book, but that's a great thing to consider

00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:21.980
as we explore multiple viewpoints.

00:20:21.980 --> 00:20:25.940 position:61%
So, once again, as you're looking at
this image we can revisit this painting

00:20:25.940 --> 00:20:27.890
and consider multiple viewpoints.

00:20:27.890 --> 00:20:34.540 position:75%
We could take on the role of each of the people,
and a fun activity is to add speech bubbles

00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:38.420
with statements above their heads
to get the conversations started.

00:20:38.420 --> 00:20:39.500
The student's love to do this.

00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:44.830 position:67%
I've done it with a class using the post-it
speech bubbles, and the students change

00:20:44.830 --> 00:20:50.690 position:73%
out the viewpoints and statements to illustrate
their varied perspectives and points of view,

00:20:50.690 --> 00:20:53.730 position:59%
and it's a very enlightening activity.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:59.070 position:61%
So, in quotation marks, as we're moving
on, if you want to have any viewpoints

00:20:59.070 --> 00:21:05.290 position:66%
that the different people in the
painting might have, feel free to do that.

00:21:05.290 --> 00:21:11.160 position:69%
And, this is going to bring me to our fourth
strategy which is compare and connect.

00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:17.130 position:70%
So, thinking about our image that you've been
considering, I want to talk about how I think

00:21:17.130 --> 00:21:23.270 position:67%
about reading and literacy education, and I
know that many connections of text to self,

00:21:23.270 --> 00:21:29.100 position:64%
text to image, and text to the world are
often used to enhance thinking about text

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:34.480
in many ways, and comprehension,
so I want to extend that to images.

00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:37.130
So, I advocate that we think
about image to self.

00:21:37.130 --> 00:21:39.910
How do you relate to this image?

00:21:39.910 --> 00:21:42.570
What are your similar experiences?

00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:43.690
Image to image.

00:21:43.690 --> 00:21:47.400
How did this compare to another
image you are familiar with?

00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:49.010
Or, one that we provide?

00:21:49.010 --> 00:21:51.260
And, image to world.

00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.650 position:59%
What, in this big world of ours would
you compare and connect this image to?

00:21:57.650 --> 00:22:04.380 position:73%
So, once again, as you're looking at the image
think about how you might relate to this image.

00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:11.510 position:66%
Is there anything in this image that feels
familiar, or you have some background

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:14.890 position:56%
that it brings up or reminds you of?

00:22:14.890 --> 00:22:19.770
And, someone asked if I could
state again about image to image.

00:22:19.770 --> 00:22:25.690
So, image to image would be how
does this compare to another image.

00:22:25.690 --> 00:22:32.060 position:59%
So, we would provide another image
that we can compare and contrast with.

00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:36.920 position:69%
And, image to world, of course, is
connecting this image to things in the world

00:22:36.920 --> 00:22:41.500 position:63%
that you could compare and connect with.

00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:46.740 position:63%
&gt;&gt; One thing that I do which is an image
to self-creation, is to ask my students

00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:52.090 position:64%
to either draw or tell me what they would
include in the picture of Thanksgiving.

00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:56.420
And, we actually do this before we
look at any images of Thanksgiving.

00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:00.140
Paige and I were talking about
this in relation to ourselves.

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.000
Paige is from a big Italian family,

00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:05.340
and so spaghetti is going to
be on the Thanksgiving table.

00:23:05.340 --> 00:23:09.170 position:61%
That is just part of their Thanksgiving
celebration which is not something

00:23:09.170 --> 00:23:12.340
that I might include, and
so there are little things,

00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:15.800 position:72%
and certainly big things that are differences.

00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:22.060
There are numerous primary sources
on the Library of Congress site.

00:23:22.060 --> 00:23:27.520 position:72%
The nice thing is that you have a whole
packet of a variety of resources in one place,

00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:32.600 position:59%
and there are also excellent teachers
guides if you need help in using them.

00:23:32.600 --> 00:23:38.280 position:58%
I go back to these again, and again
as I'm working on different projects.

00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:43.450 position:67%
&gt;&gt; And, of course the image that we've been
working with, the First Thanksgiving, 1621,

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:49.680 position:64%
came from the Library of Congress, and it
has many more artifacts, primary sources,

00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:57.820 position:70%
and images that you can have the students add
to their knowledge and compare and connect.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:24:03.420 position:58%
So, as you think about sharing visual
representations with your students,

00:24:03.420 --> 00:24:09.910 position:75%
some of the many strategies that you can use
that can help them see more deeply, like artist,

00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:15.430
like scientists is to observe and
describe, question and investigate,

00:24:15.430 --> 00:24:19.250 position:63%
explore viewpoints, compare and connect.

00:24:19.250 --> 00:24:25.110 position:61%
So, we are now going to - - Susan is
going to apply some of these strategies

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.560
and make some more connections
with some additional content.

00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:34.320
&gt;&gt; The following strategy is from
the compare and connect category,

00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:39.930 position:75%
and it's called "I used to think...now I think."

00:24:39.930 --> 00:24:45.070 position:61%
I used a photograph from the Library of
Congress collections for this activity.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:49.320
Now, whenever we start with any
image I always ask my students

00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:51.900 position:58%
to take time to observe and describe.

00:24:51.900 --> 00:24:57.270 position:69%
They may do this silently, or they may write
it down, but that's the starting point.

00:24:57.270 --> 00:25:03.110 position:67%
For my students with this exercise, and
for you I have three questions I'd like you

00:25:03.110 --> 00:25:07.820
to think about, but don't
post any answers right now.

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:09.490 position:66%
If you've already posted them that's fine.

00:25:09.490 --> 00:25:11.940 position:63%
Oh my gosh Patti, I cannot believe that.

00:25:11.940 --> 00:25:14.400
It's a small world, isn't it?

00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:18.910 position:67%
You're going to see these questions again
at the end of the activity and answer them.

00:25:18.910 --> 00:25:24.690 position:75%
My students would actually write these down, and
then they'd continue to revise as we went along.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:28.440
I could project the image, or
I could have individual copies.

00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:34.260 position:75%
I have a class that a plastic magnifying glasses
that I ordered from Organal Training Company,

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:39.290 position:56%
and I love to let the students use
those to really examine the details.

00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:44.260 position:59%
Okay, so in your mind then, have this
photograph and remember we're thinking

00:25:44.260 --> 00:25:49.330 position:63%
about what time period and what happened
before, and then what was she thinking.

00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:54.560 position:56%
And, so I used to think, but now you
have a little bit more information

00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:57.250
about this jailed woman.

00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:02.290
Does anything that you read
here cause you to reconsider any

00:26:02.290 --> 00:26:06.060 position:58%
of those answers that you had before?

00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:13.320 position:64%
Don't tell us what your answers were, but
type yes or no if you're reconsidering

00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:16.980 position:64%
or not reconsidering any of your answers.

00:26:16.980 --> 00:26:18.560
&gt;&gt; I'm so glad to see that.

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:19.920
&gt;&gt; I love seeing those objectives.

00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:24.860
If I had the whole class in
no's, then I'm really upset.

00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.950 position:66%
Alright, so we have a group of women here.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:35.170 position:75%
We can use the observe and describe technique in
having students describe what's going on here.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:37.520
What do they is going on here?

00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.610
What do they see happening?

00:26:38.610 --> 00:26:42.170 position:67%
Not inferring, but what they see happening.

00:26:42.170 --> 00:26:47.640
And, we learn that Mrs. Reed
was actually a member

00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.850 position:66%
of this group, The National Women's Party.

00:26:50.850 --> 00:26:56.930 position:56%
So, now I think, does anything in
the information above, in the image,

00:26:56.930 --> 00:27:00.560
cause you to reconsider any
of your previous answers?

00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:03.770
Well I'm starting to get the no's.

00:27:03.770 --> 00:27:05.270
I'm starting to get some no's.

00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:05.730
Okay.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.090
&gt;&gt; You might need more information.

00:27:07.090 --> 00:27:07.340
&gt;&gt; Alright.

00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:09.850
A little more information.

00:27:09.850 --> 00:27:12.190
We have a poster here.

00:27:12.190 --> 00:27:18.320
Now, would this cause you to
reconsider any of your answers?

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:21.300
And, we have another group here.

00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:27.660 position:69%
This is one where students may actually
need to describe what's going on, and again,

00:27:27.660 --> 00:27:32.980 position:59%
does anything in this photograph cause
you to reconsider any of your answers.

00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:38.850 position:61%
We have another group here, and again
an opportunity to revise your thinking.

00:27:38.850 --> 00:27:41.150 position:64%
Now, let me just add that you can shorten

00:27:41.150 --> 00:27:44.860
or lengthen this activity depending
on the time you have available.

00:27:44.860 --> 00:27:48.560
I wanted to actually include
several resources there

00:27:48.560 --> 00:27:51.230 position:73%
so that you could see the variety of resources.

00:27:51.230 --> 00:27:56.720
There's an excellent primary
source set of suffrage.

00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.350
Not all of the resources in this
exercise came from that set,

00:28:00.350 --> 00:28:03.250 position:69%
but there are some excellent resources here.

00:28:03.250 --> 00:28:06.150 position:66%
We have a different type of resource here.

00:28:06.150 --> 00:28:08.520 position:67%
We're viewing some substantial information.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:14.000
And again, an opportunity to
revise your original thinking.

00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:21.010 position:72%
Our last photograph here, a great one again to
have students describe before they reconsider.

00:28:21.010 --> 00:28:28.460 position:75%
And again, to think, is there anything here that
would cause me to reconsider any of my answers?

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:31.220 position:64%
So, now we're back to the original image.

00:28:31.220 --> 00:28:34.750 position:59%
So, let's look at our three questions.

00:28:34.750 --> 00:28:40.640 position:58%
See if you can kind of combine your
answers to the top three in one post.

00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.340 position:72%
What happened before the photograph was taken?

00:28:43.340 --> 00:28:44.320
Oh, I'm sorry.

00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:47.650
In what time period do you
think that picture was taken?

00:28:47.650 --> 00:28:49.500
What happened before it was taken?

00:28:49.500 --> 00:28:51.130
And, what is she thinking?

00:28:51.130 --> 00:28:53.200
We got lots of topic going on.

00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:54.420
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:54.980
Thank you [inaudible].

00:28:54.980 --> 00:29:03.110
&gt;&gt; I'm going to go ahead with
this as you all are talking.

00:29:03.110 --> 00:29:04.930
To think, okay.

00:29:04.930 --> 00:29:09.560 position:73%
No, I think, Clarissa, I think that's perfectly
okay to say, you know, I didn't even know

00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.600 position:69%
that this was a woman in the very beginning.

00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.730
No, that's perfectly fine.

00:29:15.730 --> 00:29:21.950 position:69%
Did you reconsider and revise any of your
answers, and if you did, to ask the students

00:29:21.950 --> 00:29:29.180 position:66%
or to ask you perhaps, what one piece of
information most influenced your revision?

00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.810 position:58%
And so, you know, to think about that
as well and have the students say,

00:29:32.810 --> 00:29:34.850 position:59%
this is when I really changed my mind.

00:29:34.850 --> 00:29:38.060
And, this is when I felt that
I was on the right track.

00:29:38.060 --> 00:29:44.650 position:72%
I thought that you might want to know a little
bit more about the subject of our photograph.

00:29:44.650 --> 00:29:49.430 position:61%
Since we're getting ready to come up on
an election, certainly, I, as a woman,

00:29:49.430 --> 00:29:54.280 position:61%
think of what many women went through
so that I might have the right to vote.

00:29:54.280 --> 00:30:00.470 position:70%
And, additionally I thought you might like
to see a picture of, what does this lady look

00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:07.060 position:63%
like when she was in jail, and then as a
younger woman in the second photograph.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:12.490
There's an additional thinking
routine in observing and describing

00:30:12.490 --> 00:30:17.060 position:66%
in artful thinking called, "the beginning,
middle, and end" that we love to use.

00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:22.630
If this image were the beginning of
story, what's going to happen next?

00:30:22.630 --> 00:30:26.460 position:58%
If it's the middle of a story, what
might have happened before and after?

00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:30.450
And, if it's the end of a
story, then what was the story?

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.350 position:75%
And, so that's a great technique to use as well.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:37.610 position:73%
&gt;&gt; Absolutely, and you can do that with so many
images, and really have your students think

00:30:37.610 --> 00:30:41.940
about that as well, and in
terms of a timeline too.

00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:43.400
Time flies when you're having fun.

00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:46.950 position:75%
Susan and I, we want to have time for questions,

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:49.920
but we're going to share
some additional resources

00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.920
that have been useful for
us for visual literacy.

00:30:54.920 --> 00:31:02.500 position:70%
Some of my favorites include; the Smithsonian
American Art Museum and the education links

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:09.260 position:63%
at that resource there are so many great
works of art and teacher resources,

00:31:09.260 --> 00:31:12.760 position:64%
and fabulous questions to ask about that.

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:19.700 position:58%
&gt;&gt; I wanted to just mention one thing
about the Alabama Archives site.

00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:28.420 position:72%
It has a remarkable collection of civil rights
resources, and I love "Read Like a Historian"

00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:32.960
because it engages students
and historical inquiry.

00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:37.620 position:70%
I love anything that's already set up for
teachers, and these all have great resources,

00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:43.340 position:61%
but then they also have great teacher's
guides and lesson plans already set up.

00:31:43.340 --> 00:31:47.740 position:56%
Of course, we love the Library of
Congress, that's why we're all here.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:52.070
National Archives and Records also
has a wonderful education site,

00:31:52.070 --> 00:31:54.090
as does the Smithsonian.

00:31:54.090 --> 00:31:56.710 position:58%
&gt;&gt; There are so many image resources.

00:31:56.710 --> 00:32:00.410
I can sit all day and look at
the Life Magazine resource.

00:32:00.410 --> 00:32:03.540 position:72%
I really encourage you to take a look at that.

00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.910 position:58%
There are images, clip art,
pictures, and image search galleries,

00:32:07.910 --> 00:32:11.500 position:63%
and Google has wonderful images as well.

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:15.420 position:73%
Of course, the Library of Congress Fine Prints.

00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:20.070 position:67%
This "Opinionated Art" [inaudible] Fine
Art Print collection, is a fabulous article

00:32:20.070 --> 00:32:25.030 position:70%
that I wanted to make note of, and I really
encourage our listeners to read this as well.

00:32:25.030 --> 00:32:32.810 position:69%
This is a list of additional resources for
primary sources that Susan really likes too.

00:32:32.810 --> 00:32:35.090 position:61%
I think you provided this for us Susan.

00:32:35.090 --> 00:32:39.680 position:69%
&gt;&gt; Yes. These are sources that I use with my
students in my Social Studies Methods course

00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:47.100 position:70%
to find primary sources, not necessarily
images, but other types of primary resources.

00:32:47.100 --> 00:32:51.190 position:70%
&gt;&gt; I love that Karen mentioned there's even
a Head Start version of "Teacher in America."

00:32:51.190 --> 00:32:54.320 position:72%
I have found that Karen, and that if fabulous.

00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:59.730 position:75%
One of my areas of expertise is early childhood,
and I encourage everyone to look that up

00:32:59.730 --> 00:33:01.470 position:59%
as well if that's an area you work in.

00:33:01.470 --> 00:33:05.730
These are just some more visual
literacy learner activities.

00:33:05.730 --> 00:33:10.620 position:64%
Just some starters on getting students to
describe, and to observe, and to connect,

00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.400
and interpret, and all of
the things we talked about.

00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:16.780
Things like writing a conversation
between characters,

00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:18.730 position:72%
imagining that an artist show has just opened.

00:33:18.730 --> 00:33:21.140
This will give you some more ideas

00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.110
for implementing these strategies
that we've been sharing today.

00:33:25.110 --> 00:33:31.440 position:66%
&gt;&gt; I always love asking students what they
smell, or hear when they look at an image,

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:37.090 position:66%
and at first, they look at me like I'm
crazy, and then they immediately start in,

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:41.740
and it's amazing the things
that they come up with.

00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:45.490
&gt;&gt; Lisa and Alissa have asked
about a handout page.

00:33:45.490 --> 00:33:53.080 position:75%
I believe all of this will be available to us
after this conference, but feel free to email us

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:57.290
and I don't mind sending
all the resources at all.

00:33:57.290 --> 00:33:58.080
&gt;&gt; Absolutely.

00:33:58.080 --> 00:33:58.890
We would love to.

00:33:58.890 --> 00:34:02.730
&gt;&gt; And, let us know that what
you're doing that's related

00:34:02.730 --> 00:34:06.370 position:69%
to visual literacy, and sharing these ideas.

00:34:06.370 --> 00:34:13.130 position:61%
Also, any additional resources that you
used that has enhanced your teaching,

00:34:13.130 --> 00:34:15.820
we would love to hear from you too.

00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.650 position:66%
&gt;&gt; Thank you so much for joining us today.

00:34:17.650 --> 00:34:19.880 position:63%
I wish we could have seen you in person.

00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.480 position:58%
It was, again, so fun to see so many
people from so many different places.
