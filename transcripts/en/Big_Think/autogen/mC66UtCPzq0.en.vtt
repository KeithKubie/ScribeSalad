from our leakage radiation our broadcast

from our leakage radiation our broadcast
television and radio you can tell some

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:09.650
television and radio you can tell some
 

00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:13.770
television and radio you can tell some
amazing things about the planet and the

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:13.780
amazing things about the planet and the
 

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.310
amazing things about the planet and the
technological species that occupy it you

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:18.320
technological species that occupy it you
 

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.140
technological species that occupy it you
can certainly get the length of our day

00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:20.150
can certainly get the length of our day
 

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.350
can certainly get the length of our day
you can get an estimate of the size of

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:23.360
you can get an estimate of the size of
 

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:28.599
you can get an estimate of the size of
the planet you can even deduce that we

00:00:28.599 --> 00:00:28.609
the planet you can even deduce that we
 

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:31.979
the planet you can even deduce that we
don't have any kind of global governance

00:00:31.979 --> 00:00:31.989
don't have any kind of global governance
 

00:00:31.989 --> 00:00:36.790
don't have any kind of global governance
that's because in every region of the

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:36.800
that's because in every region of the
 

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:41.469
that's because in every region of the
planet television stations and radio

00:00:41.469 --> 00:00:41.479
planet television stations and radio
 

00:00:41.479 --> 00:00:44.799
planet television stations and radio
stations are assigned frequencies that

00:00:44.799 --> 00:00:44.809
stations are assigned frequencies that
 

00:00:44.809 --> 00:00:47.939
stations are assigned frequencies that
are specific to the different

regions around the globe and those

00:00:54.009 --> 00:00:54.019
regions around the globe and those
 

00:00:54.019 --> 00:00:57.939
regions around the globe and those
frequencies are similar but not exactly

00:00:57.939 --> 00:00:57.949
frequencies are similar but not exactly
 

00:00:57.949 --> 00:01:01.299
frequencies are similar but not exactly
the same so if you were getting the

00:01:01.299 --> 00:01:01.309
the same so if you were getting the
 

00:01:01.309 --> 00:01:04.000
the same so if you were getting the
broadcast transmission leakage from this

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:04.010
broadcast transmission leakage from this
 

00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:07.990
broadcast transmission leakage from this
planet as our planet rotates and another

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.000
planet as our planet rotates and another
 

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:11.200
planet as our planet rotates and another
region comes into view on the horizon

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:11.210
region comes into view on the horizon
 

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:13.600
region comes into view on the horizon
you'd see that those transmission

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:13.610
you'd see that those transmission
 

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.570
you'd see that those transmission
frequencies shift a little and 24 hours

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:16.580
frequencies shift a little and 24 hours
 

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:18.520
frequencies shift a little and 24 hours
they're back to that same pattern and

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:18.530
they're back to that same pattern and
 

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:22.660
they're back to that same pattern and
you would probably deduce that the whole

00:01:22.660 --> 00:01:22.670
you would probably deduce that the whole
 

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:26.680
you would probably deduce that the whole
planet was not operating as a single

00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:26.690
planet was not operating as a single
 

00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:33.730
planet was not operating as a single
geopolitical unit so we talked a little

00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:33.740
geopolitical unit so we talked a little
 

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.730
geopolitical unit so we talked a little
about we and we often think about what's

00:01:36.730 --> 00:01:36.740
about we and we often think about what's
 

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.030
about we and we often think about what's
gonna happen if we detect a signal and

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:40.040
gonna happen if we detect a signal and
 

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.580
gonna happen if we detect a signal and
certainly the SETI Institute is part of

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:42.590
certainly the SETI Institute is part of
 

00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:45.100
certainly the SETI Institute is part of
a group of scientists who are working on

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:45.110
a group of scientists who are working on
 

00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:47.200
a group of scientists who are working on
the project who've said well you know if

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:47.210
the project who've said well you know if
 

00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:48.670
the project who've said well you know if
we detect a signal we're certainly going

00:01:48.670 --> 00:01:48.680
we detect a signal we're certainly going
 

00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:51.760
we detect a signal we're certainly going
to tell the world but we're not going to

00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:51.770
to tell the world but we're not going to
 

00:01:51.770 --> 00:01:55.149
to tell the world but we're not going to
transmit back until there's been some

00:01:55.149 --> 00:01:55.159

global consensus that we should and then

00:01:59.380 --> 00:01:59.390
global consensus that we should and then
 

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:01.600
global consensus that we should and then
you know we figure out who should speak

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:01.610
you know we figure out who should speak
 

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:04.000
you know we figure out who should speak
for Earth what should we say and that's

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:04.010
for Earth what should we say and that's
 

00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:08.020
for Earth what should we say and that's
all great really hard to understand how

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:08.030
all great really hard to understand how
 

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.360
all great really hard to understand how
we'll do it and at the same time if you

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.370
we'll do it and at the same time if you
 

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:15.680
we'll do it and at the same time if you
announce that you've detected a signal

00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:15.690
announce that you've detected a signal
 

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.500
announce that you've detected a signal
and you give the nature of the signal

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.510
and you give the nature of the signal
 

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.380
and you give the nature of the signal
you let other people know what you found

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:21.390
you let other people know what you found
 

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.100
you let other people know what you found
then it's human nature anyone who can

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:25.110
then it's human nature anyone who can
 

00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:26.930
then it's human nature anyone who can
have access to some kind of a

they're going to say whatever it is that
