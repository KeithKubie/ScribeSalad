00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to do your science
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.880 align:start position:0%
what's the best way to do your science
so<00:00:38.640><c> I</c><00:00:38.820><c> enjoy</c><00:00:39.420><c> writing</c><00:00:39.570><c> the</c><00:00:39.750><c> grants</c><00:00:40.140><c> and</c><00:00:40.350><c> I</c>

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:40.890 align:start position:0%
so I enjoy writing the grants and I
 

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.850 align:start position:0%
so I enjoy writing the grants and I
think<00:00:41.100><c> it's</c><00:00:41.219><c> important</c><00:00:42.440><c> but</c><00:00:43.440><c> at</c><00:00:43.590><c> the</c><00:00:43.649><c> same</c>

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:43.860 align:start position:0%
think it's important but at the same
 

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:45.440 align:start position:0%
think it's important but at the same
time<00:00:44.040><c> it's</c><00:00:44.489><c> definitely</c><00:00:44.879><c> difficult</c><00:00:45.030><c> for</c><00:00:45.360><c> a</c><00:00:45.390><c> lot</c>

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:45.450 align:start position:0%
time it's definitely difficult for a lot
 

00:00:45.450 --> 00:00:48.650 align:start position:0%
time it's definitely difficult for a lot
of<00:00:45.539><c> scientists</c><00:00:45.930><c> because</c><00:00:46.910><c> money</c><00:00:47.910><c> is</c><00:00:48.000><c> becoming</c>

00:00:48.650 --> 00:00:48.660 align:start position:0%
of scientists because money is becoming
 

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:50.569 align:start position:0%
of scientists because money is becoming
more<00:00:48.780><c> scarce</c><00:00:49.079><c> and</c><00:00:49.500><c> this</c><00:00:49.980><c> isn't</c><00:00:50.309><c> a</c><00:00:50.370><c> great</c><00:00:50.489><c> time</c>

00:00:50.569 --> 00:00:50.579 align:start position:0%
more scarce and this isn't a great time
 

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:53.119 align:start position:0%

for<00:00:51.090><c> the</c><00:00:51.660><c> national</c><00:00:52.050><c> budget</c><00:00:52.140><c> and</c><00:00:52.559><c> science</c><00:00:53.010><c> so</c>

00:00:53.119 --> 00:00:53.129 align:start position:0%
for the national budget and science so
 

00:00:53.129 --> 00:00:55.040 align:start position:0%
for the national budget and science so
that<00:00:53.309><c> that</c><00:00:53.489><c> makes</c><00:00:53.699><c> it</c><00:00:53.820><c> difficult</c><00:00:54.050><c> so</c>

00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:55.050 align:start position:0%
that that makes it difficult so
 

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.810 align:start position:0%
that that makes it difficult so
obviously<00:00:55.590><c> I</c><00:00:55.680><c> wouldn't</c><00:00:55.829><c> want</c><00:00:56.039><c> it</c><00:00:56.129><c> if</c><00:00:56.250><c> I</c><00:00:56.430><c> you</c>

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:01.890 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time but I see why
 

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.390 align:start position:0%
for a long period of time but I see why
it's<00:01:02.010><c> important</c><00:01:02.430><c> I</c><00:01:06.380><c> think</c><00:01:07.380><c> like</c><00:01:07.680><c> most</c><00:01:07.950><c> people</c>

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:08.400 align:start position:0%
