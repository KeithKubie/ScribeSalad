 Hello everyone, My name is Dale Yoo and I work as CEO and creator of games at Daeri Soft. 

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.748
 We were developing easy games 

00:00:13.750 --> 00:00:16.348
 Such as simplified games or puzzle games since 2008. 

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:20.298
 At present, our main game is Freestyle Baseball 2. 

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:26.368
 I gained the impetus to enter the gaming industry through my experience as a game graphics designer. 

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.198
 Everyone dreams of creating their own game. 

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.748
 So I entered strongly in the design of games using the retirement bonus. 

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.998
 Free style Baseball 1 brings together multiple players from around the world in real time. 

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.028
 I discovered that the real-time multiplayer functionality of the Google Play Games service allows 

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:49.648
 Both server functionality and player games with global users. 

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.348
 And gained very good experience while using these services. 

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:59.698
 It is clear that the real-time retention of players and players is closely related. 

00:00:59.700 --> 00:01:03.898
 Our game was released in September and featured in the World Games section. 

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:06.898
 The game was offered for sale in about 140 countries. 

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.178
 Our game was downloaded 130,000 times a day 

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.698
 And one million times a month. 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:15.998
 The figures were as follows. 

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.298
 15% in America, 

00:01:18.300 --> 00:01:19.898
 And 10% in Korea, 

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.398
 And 10% in Japan 

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:23.498
 And 8% in Taiwan. 

00:01:23.500 --> 00:01:27.048
 In terms of retention figures we got about 45% per day 

00:01:27.050 --> 00:01:30.448
 For Korea, Japan and Taiwan. 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:34.418
 In the case of America, the figure ranges from 35% to 40% per day. 

00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:39.498
 We also received a lot of help when we did the pre-test. 

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:42.298
 At first, we tried a symbol, 

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.598
 Downloads increased by 10 to 15%. 

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:51.798
 As I mentioned earlier, the ratio increased by 10% when we moved on to steps 2 and 3. 

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:57.698
 When we took the last step, the percentage increased significantly by 200 to 300%. 

00:01:57.700 --> 00:02:02.548
 This has led to our very positive situation, 

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.348
 Because the total number of downloads exceeded 130 thousand each day for global markets. 

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:10.168
 We have a plan to take advantage of Google's real-time API functionality 

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:15.468
 Players around the world can easily enjoy the game of Freestyle Sport World from Daeri Soft. 

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:20.348
 We will do our best to become a global company in the development of sports games.
