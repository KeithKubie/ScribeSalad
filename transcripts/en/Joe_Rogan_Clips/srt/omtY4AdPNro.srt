1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,670
And, uh, how many people's at 20,000.

2
00:00:02,900 --> 00:00:07,900
[inaudible] and Elton John held
the record before we broke it.

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:11,760
And the reason we broke it as we
were in a center stage in the middle,

4
00:00:11,761 --> 00:00:13,690
and there's only four of us
doing stand up. So it was,

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:18,260
there's nobody will ever have a smaller
stage. Wow. For that show there.

6
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:22,980
Right. How could they, and that was right
before we film blue collar. One two done.

7
00:00:23,010 --> 00:00:26,070
Josh Wolfe showed me a picture when
you opened up for Larry, the cable guy,

8
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:27,930
you will open up at some football arena.

9
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:32,070
He's on stage and he takes it like a
selfie out. Looking at the audience.

10
00:00:32,071 --> 00:00:35,370
It's the craziest thing you've ever
seen your life. See if you can find it.

11
00:00:35,730 --> 00:00:40,320
Josh Wolfe, uh, opening up for
Larry, the cable Guy Selfie.

12
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:43,380
It's fun. I don't even know if he put it
online. He showed it to me on his phone.

13
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:48,360
It's fucking bananas. There's
50,000 people there, you know,

14
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,510
50,000. But yeah, he was doing,
he was doing crazy, crazy,

15
00:00:51,511 --> 00:00:55,830
crazy numbers and say numbers and
didn't even talk about it. You know,

16
00:00:55,831 --> 00:00:58,890
there was a lot of people that are hating
on him. He couldn't be a nicer guy.

17
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:04,380
He's also a great pace, rhythm and
timing. One lander guys, you know,

18
00:01:04,770 --> 00:01:09,750
and uh, as good as a gets, I've seen him
just beat crowds to death. Funny Dude.

19
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,670
And uh, and gifted. And also it was done.

20
00:01:12,690 --> 00:01:14,790
It totally paid his dues.

21
00:01:14,791 --> 00:01:18,930
You know how many percent I met him in 92.

22
00:01:18,931 --> 00:01:22,910
I think you've known him
longer than I have shit. Look
at that fucking guy, right?

23
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,480
Yeah. I haven't played this
place. Look at that fucking crowd.

24
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:31,350
That's gotta be the guy that's gotta
be in Nebraska, right? So, right.

25
00:01:31,351 --> 00:01:35,520
Everybody's right. There's gotta be a
borrow state stadium in Lincoln, Nebraska.

26
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:38,640
That is one of the most insane
crowds I've ever seen in my life.

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,920
But it makes sense. He's got great
fucking timing, man. And I met him,

28
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,960
like I said,
in 92,

29
00:01:45,961 --> 00:01:50,961
I think at the comedy works in Montreal
when Jimbo used to run the joint and he

30
00:01:53,041 --> 00:01:56,510
was a great guy, man back then. Even
back then, he was a, I think he was a,

31
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:00,000
it was a radio personality in
Florida at the time, you know,

32
00:02:00,050 --> 00:02:04,080
he's just [inaudible] the cable guy was
a character he did in that and that he

33
00:02:04,081 --> 00:02:08,220
would bring into a show for one joke and
then it kind of just took over fucking

34
00:02:08,221 --> 00:02:12,240
crazy. And people don't know, like he's
Dan Whitney. He's like a regular person.

35
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,690
Regular. Yeah. But he's trapped. Right.

36
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:18,800
He is Larry the cable trap it a place
you'd like to be trapped, right? Oh yeah,

37
00:02:19,090 --> 00:02:21,390
yeah.
Making $30 million a year.

38
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:26,070
It's like this marvelous Mrs Maizel thing.
Except he's, that's who he actually is.

39
00:02:26,071 --> 00:02:29,190
I mean, he doesn't have to wear a fat
suit or anything crazy, but you know,

40
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:33,540
his dad was a preacher and a
pig farmer from Nebraska. Wow.

41
00:02:33,960 --> 00:02:35,730
And, uh, and so he does this,

42
00:02:36,010 --> 00:02:40,860
a great auctioneer boys where [inaudible]
has sold a little Danny Whitney from

43
00:02:40,861 --> 00:02:45,450
across the street. Wow. A
preacher in a pig farmer.

44
00:02:45,451 --> 00:02:46,380
Holy Shit.
