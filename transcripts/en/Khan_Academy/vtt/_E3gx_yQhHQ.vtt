00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.700
We're asked to solve
the quadratic equation,

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:07.620
negative 3x squared plus
10x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:09.560
And it's already written
in standard form.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:11.060
And there's many
ways to solve this.

00:00:11.060 --> 00:00:13.597
But in particular, all solve
it using the quadratic formula.

00:00:13.597 --> 00:00:14.680
So let me just rewrite it.

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:19.435
We have negative 3x squared
plus 10x minus 3 is equal to 0.

00:00:19.435 --> 00:00:20.810
And actually, I'll
solve it twice

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:22.720
using the quadratic
formula to show you

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:25.350
that as long as we manipulated
this in the valid way,

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:26.850
the quadratic
formula will give us

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:29.900
the exact same roots or
the exact same solutions

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:31.370
to this equation.

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:34.322
So in this form right over
here, what are our ABCs?

00:00:34.322 --> 00:00:36.780
Let's just remind ourselves
what the quadratic formula even

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:37.450
is actually.

00:00:37.450 --> 00:00:38.730
That's a good place to start.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:40.640
The quadratic formula
tells us that if we

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.170
have a quadratic
equation in the form ax

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:48.320
squared plus bx plus c is equal
to 0, so in standard form,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:52.360
then the roots of this are
x are equal to negative b

00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:55.630
plus or minus the
square root of b

00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.430
squared minus 4ac,
all of that over 2a.

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:05.239
And this is derived from
completing the square

00:01:05.239 --> 00:01:06.410
in a general way.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:09.914
So it's no magic here, and I've
derived it in other videos.

00:01:09.914 --> 00:01:11.330
But this is the
quadratic formula.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.910
This is actually giving
you two solutions,

00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:14.890
because you have the
positive square root here

00:01:14.890 --> 00:01:16.680
and the negative square root.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.750
So let's apply it here in the
case where-- in this case,

00:01:19.750 --> 00:01:26.890
a is equal to negative
3, b is equal to 10,

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.000
and c is equal to negative 3.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.240
So applying the quadratic
formula right here,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.526
we get our solutions to be
x is equal to negative b.

00:01:36.526 --> 00:01:37.530
b is 10.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:42.800
So negative b is negative 10
plus or minus the square root

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:44.690
of b squared.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:45.460
b is 10.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:50.650
So b squared is 100
minus 4 times a times c.

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:54.387
So minus 4 times negative
3 times negative 3.

00:01:54.387 --> 00:01:55.470
Let me just write it down.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:58.930
Minus 4 times negative
3 times negative 3.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:01.100
All of that's under
the radical sign.

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:02.860
And then all of that is over 2a.

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.540
So 2 times a is negative 6.

00:02:05.540 --> 00:02:07.660
So this is going to be
equal to negative 10

00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:14.710
plus or minus the square root
of 100 minus-- negative 3 times

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:16.080
negative 3 is positive 9.

00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:18.280
Positive 9 times
4 is positive 36.

00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.530
We have a minus sign out here.

00:02:19.530 --> 00:02:21.610
So minus 36.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.860
All of that over negative 6.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:27.310
This is equal to
100 minus 36 is 64.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.830
So negative 10 plus or
minus the square root of 64.

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.900
All of that over negative 6.

00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:35.939
The principal square
root of 64 is 8.

00:02:35.939 --> 00:02:38.230
But we're taking the positive
and negative square root.

00:02:38.230 --> 00:02:43.940
So this is negative 10 plus
or minus 8 over negative 6.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.620
So if we take the
positive version,

00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.210
we say x could be
equal to-- negative 10

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:52.560
plus 8 is negative
2 over negative 6.

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.570
So that was taking
the plus version.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:56.330
That's this right over here.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.940
And negative 2 over
negative 6 is equal to 1/3.

00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.840
If we take the
negative square root,

00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.610
negative 10 minus 8-- So let's
take negative 10 minus 8.

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:08.030
That would be x is equal
to-- negative 10 minus 8

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:10.070
is negative 18.

00:03:10.070 --> 00:03:13.490
And that's going to
be over negative 6.

00:03:13.490 --> 00:03:16.930
Negative 18 divided by
negative 6 is positive 3.

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:19.380
So the two roots for
this quadratic equation

00:03:19.380 --> 00:03:22.492
are positive 1/3 and positive 3.

00:03:22.492 --> 00:03:24.700
And I want to show you the
we'll get the same answer,

00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:25.740
even if we manipulate this.

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.280
Some people might
not like the fact

00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.120
that our first coefficient
here is a negative 3.

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.876
Maybe they want a positive 3.

00:03:31.876 --> 00:03:33.250
So to get rid of
that negative 3,

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:37.010
they can multiply both sides of
this equation times negative 1.

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:39.270
And then if you did
that, you would get 3x

00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:45.000
squared minus 10x plus 3 is
equal to 0 times negative 1,

00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.900
which is still equal to 0.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.990
So in this case, a is equal to
3, b is equal to negative 10,

00:03:51.990 --> 00:03:54.430
and c is equal to 3 again.

00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.400
And we could apply
the quadratic formula.

00:03:56.400 --> 00:04:00.560
We get x is equal to
negative b. b is negative 10.

00:04:00.560 --> 00:04:02.460
So negative negative
10 is positive

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.300
10, plus or minus
the square root

00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.950
of b squared, which is
negative 10 squared,

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:12.110
which is 100, minus
4 times a times c.

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.070
a times c is 9 times 4 is 36.

00:04:16.070 --> 00:04:17.980
So minus 36.

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:20.250
All of that over 2 times a.

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:21.990
All of that over 6.

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:28.030
So this is equal to 10 plus or
minus the square root of 64,

00:04:28.030 --> 00:04:30.660
or really that's
just going to be 8.

00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:32.210
All of that over 6.

00:04:32.210 --> 00:04:36.420
If we add 8 here, we get
10 plus 8 is 18 over 6.

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.310
We get x could be equal to 3.

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.300
Or if we take the negative
square root or the negative 8

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:43.100
here, 10 minus 8 is 2.

00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:46.280
2 over 6 is 1/3.

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:50.300
So once again, you get
the exact same solutions.
