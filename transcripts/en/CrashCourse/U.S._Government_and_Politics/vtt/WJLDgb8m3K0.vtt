00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:06.880
Hello, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government and Politics, and today we're going to begin our

00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:09.260
discussion of politics, rather than government.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.280
Aren't they the same thing, Stan? Aren't they the... They're not the same? Oh...

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.120
I know some of you are saying that we've been talking about politics all along,

00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:19.260
and in a sense, that's true. But for the rest of the series we'll be looking more closely at policies and

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:24.020
the factors that influence how they're made, rather than the institutions and structures that make them.

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.100
One way to think about this is that "government" describes the what, the who, and the how of policies.

00:00:28.100 --> 00:00:32.380
And "politics" describes the why. Don't ask me about the where or the when journalism students.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:36.460
Actually, just don't ask me anything. Because I won't hear you. This is a YouTube video.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:39.900
Another way that I like to think about politics is that following it is like following sports.

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.060
With any political event, whether an election, or a congressional vote, or a Supreme Court decision,

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:48.260
you can spend time analyzing and predicting what might happen and then, after the fact, you can

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.960
analyze why your prediction was correct, or way off base.

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:55.120
Just like what happens before and after a big game, or race, or whatever you choose to follow.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:59.200
This is getting very conceptual, and today we're going to focus on one particular aspect of politics that

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:02.640
looms large in America: Godzilla. No! Public opinion.

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:11.540
[Theme Music]

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.620
Public opinion can refer to a lot of things, but one useful definition is that it refers to

00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:20.300
"How a nation's population collectively views vital policy issues and evaluates political leaders."

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.260
Public opinion matters in America, especially because it's a democracy,

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:26.740
which classicists out there will know  comes from the Greek word "Demokratia",

00:01:26.740 --> 00:01:28.400
which means ruled by the people.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.480
It's not a drug for balding men? No, that's something else.

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:35.400
And anyone who's been forced to learn the Gettysburg Address knows, like Abraham Lincoln,

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:38.940
America's is a government "of the people, by the people, for the people."

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:42.520
So what the people think, especially about how the government should govern, matters.

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:45.100
But it also raises some important questions. Namely:

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.780
"How do the people express what they want?"

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.500
"How does or should the government respond to the people?"

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:53.480
And, the one we'll start with: "What if the people don't know what they want or are just plain ignorant?"

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:56.680
The framers of the Constitution were somewhat skeptical of the ability of the average

00:01:56.680 --> 00:02:01.140
American to understand and influence public policy, so they gave Americans direct influence

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.000
over only one part of the government: the House of Representatives.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.940
This view that the ignorant masses were not to be fully trusted with the hard work of governing won out

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:12.200
over the Anti-Federalist view that more popular participation was better, but is it justified?

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:16.760
Many people, including a lot of political scientists, say it's justified. Public issues are complicated,

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.920
and many people, most of the time, are either uninterested or confused by them.

00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:23.980
This isn't necessarily a bad thing, especially for those who see disengagement from politics as an example

00:02:23.980 --> 00:02:29.500
of "rational ignorance." Given the high cost of being informed, it makes good sense to stay less informed.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:32.880
And there have been a number of books that show us just how uniformed Americans can be.

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:37.240
The most notable was "The American Voter" in 1960, which showed us how little most Americans

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:41.340
knew, or cared, about politics, and suggested that people's opinions were so changeable and random,

00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:44.900
that the authors concluded that "most people don't have real opinions at all."

00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:47.020
Wow. I have no opinion about that.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:51.980
Oh, and if you're thinking: "Well that's fine, but in 1960 Americans had so much less information available to them."

00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.860
"They didn't even have color then. And everyone wore hats. Everyone wore hats then!"

00:02:55.860 --> 00:02:59.140
Today we have the Internet and 24 hour TV news, but here's a statistic:

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:03.940
In 1960, 47% of people were unable to name the member of the House who represented them.

00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:06.180
In 2010, it was 59%.

00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:09.880
On the other hand, there are political scientists who argue that looking at individual voters

00:03:09.880 --> 00:03:12.500
and their responses to questionnaires is the wrong way to go.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:18.200
For writers like Benjamin Page and Robert Shapiro, authors of "The Rational Public," the key is to look at collective opinion.

00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:21.660
If you take large numbers of Americans and aggregate their opinions you find that they are much

00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:25.480
more coherent and stable, and reflect reasonable judgements about politics and government.

00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.100
Next time you disagree with me and call me crazy, Stan, just aggregate my opinion.

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:30.900
You will find it doesn't vary so much.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:35.060
Closely related to this idea of large groups of people basically getting things right about politics

00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:40.060
is Condorcet's Jury Theorem, which demonstrated that while one juror had only a slightly better chance

00:03:40.060 --> 00:03:44.220
of determining a defendant's guilt or innocence than a coin flip, a larger group of jurrors

00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.260
would produce a majority that would be more likely than not to get the case right.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:50.600
James Surowiecki summed it up well in his book "The Wisdom of Crowds", arguing that

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:56.060
"Even if one voter does not have clear political views, a larger group, taken together, adds up to a rational public."

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:59.480
So assuming, that like Lincoln, we actually want public opinion to influence government,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:01.080
we need to take into account a few things.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.740
First, we should have a reasonably good idea that the people know what they want.

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.900
Second, the people should be able to communicate what they want to government officials.

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:10.820
And third, the government should pay attention to the public's desires and respond accordingly.

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:13.820
All three of these conditions can provide interesting problems of their own.

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:17.220
Even if you agree with the rational public idea, and assume that the population as a whole

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:21.300
does have coherent political views, the chances are good that what the public wants consists mostly

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:24.160
of generalities, and are difficult to turn into actual policies.

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.520
For example: after the 2008 financial crisis, there was a general anger with Wall Street banks,

00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:31.900
but different polls on the issue revealed no consensus about what to do about things like

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.580
executive compensation, or regulating complex financial transactions.

00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:39.780
It's difficult to say that the resulting Dodd-Frank Bill represented an expression of the popular will.

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:43.180
The public communicates what it wants in a number of ways. Most obviously: voting.

00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:47.100
But let's just say that people have other ways than election results of letting their voices be heard.

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.600
Or their punches. But don't do that. That was just...
that's a fake eagle. Don't worry about it.

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:57.420
Even though politicians often claim that winning an election gives them a "mandate to govern,"

00:04:57.420 --> 00:05:01.480
a quick look at the unpopularity of Obamacare suggests that an election win doesn't often

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:03.980
translate into solid support for a candidate's policies.

00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:09.180
Sometimes its lack of support is due to the fact that politicians don't exactly respond to public opinion.

00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:13.180
National campaigns spend around 1 billion a year on polling, but it doesn't mean that politicians do

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:16.780
exactly what the polling suggests, and they often deny that polls influence their decisions.

00:05:16.780 --> 00:05:20.360
Even as poll conscious a politician as President Clinton didn't always do exactly

00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:22.120
what the American people said they wanted.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:28.140
For example: in 1994 the public was solidly against a plan to bail out Mexico with a multi-billion dollar loan.

00:05:28.140 --> 00:05:30.960
But Clinton pushed through an executive order making the loan anyway,

00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.600
because his advisers said this was good economic policy.

00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.180
More often politicians use public opinion polling to shape their responses to issues,

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:39.340
rather than defining the issue for the politicians,

00:05:39.340 --> 00:05:42.860
the polls are used to help them craft a message that will be more acceptable to the public.

00:05:42.860 --> 00:05:46.340
And public opinion polling certainly has a role in setting the policy agenda by informing

00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:49.600
politicians of the issues that seem to matter to Americans in the first place.

00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.720
So, in addition to voting and election results,

00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:55.240
polling is also a way Americans can let politicians know what they want.

00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:57.980
For instance: whether or not they approve of the President's performance,

00:05:57.980 --> 00:06:01.540
or of specific policies, like whether the government should allow an oil pipeline to be built.

00:06:01.540 --> 00:06:05.880
Politicians, and especially journalists, rely on these polls, but before you go jumping on that bandwagon

00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.280
there are a few things you should know about public opinion polling.

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.260
And don't just go jumping on strange bandwagons.

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.380
Let's go to the Thought Bubble.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.460
The first thing you remember when you hear or read some polling data is that there are lots of

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:18.160
ways that polls can be wrong. So there are some questions you should ask before you accept the data.

00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:20.220
There are a lot of things that can skew the results of polls,

00:06:20.220 --> 00:06:22.500
some of which are obvious, and others which are more obscure.

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:24.220
The biggest questions to ask about a poll is

00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:26.440
"How many respondents were there and how were they chosen?"

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:30.240
It's impossible to get responses to any questions from all 320 million Americans,

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:32.380
so pollsters rely on statistical sampling.

00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:37.260
In order to get a reliable sample, the magic number for pollsters is somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500.

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.100
The smaller the number, the less reliable the results are likely to be.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.140
A poll that's based on a sample that's too small may suffer from a "sampling error".

00:06:43.140 --> 00:06:46.520
You can sometimes deduce the size of a poll sample from its margin of error.

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:49.020
A poll with a small sample will have a large margin of error.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.260
In general, for national public opinion polls the margin of error will be plus or minus three points.

00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:56.780
This means that if the poll says that 53% of people support "Policy X,"

00:06:56.780 --> 00:07:00.320
it's better to say that between 50 and 56% of respondents supported it.

00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:02.000
But that's just a little math. For fun!

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.560
Polling organizations like Harris, Pew, and Gallup also strive to make sure that the

00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:08.340
respondents are a representative sample, free from "selection bias."

00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.160
Selection bias occurs when the people polled are not a representative sample of the population.

00:07:12.160 --> 00:07:15.060
Say if they're disproportionately white, or rich, or Bronies.

00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.800
The classic example of a selection bias error was

00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:21.460
the 1936 Literary Digest poll that predicted Alf Landon would defeat F.D.R.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:25.740
It turns out that Literary Digest's readership were disproportionately wealthy and Republican.

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:29.880
Another more recent source of selection bias is that polls which rely on random digit dialing of

00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:33.840
land line phones tend to under count younger people, many of whom have only cell phones.

00:07:33.840 --> 00:07:36.500
Selection bias is a particular problem with online polls.

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:41.360
Anyone who takes an online poll has by definition logged into a website and is therefore not randomly selected.

00:07:41.360 --> 00:07:45.400
Although news organizations like to report their own polling, CNN, I'm looking at you...

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.340
you should take these poll numbers with a boulder of salt. Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:07:48.340 --> 00:07:51.640
In addition to demographic factors like age, ethnicity, race, and income level,

00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.020
all of which can influence polls, when the questions are asked matters a lot.

00:07:55.020 --> 00:07:56.740
Sometimes these two factors interact.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:00.720
A poll taken on a Friday evening is likely to include a lot fewer young people responding to it.

00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:04.180
Especially me, because every Friday night I like to go out and get my swerve on.

00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.220
Which implies that I don't go out, and I haven't gone out since 2003.

00:08:08.220 --> 00:08:12.380
More significant in terms of election polling is how close the poll was to the actual election.

00:08:12.380 --> 00:08:14.380
The closer the poll, the more accurate.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.380
Polls taken immediately after the election, called "exit polls," can be very unreliable.

00:08:18.380 --> 00:08:21.660
And polls taken a few days after the election have limited predictive value.

00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:25.320
In fact, just get over it. The elections over. Just stop polling.

00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:28.620
One of the most important ways that polls can skewed is through the questions themselves.

00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:31.380
Ambiguous or poorly worded questions can result in

00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:34.620
a failure to identify the true distribution of opinion in a target population.

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:41.060
Quick poll: do you not, not, not, not unlike Crash Course? Or me as a host? Let me know in the comments.

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:43.420
The way questions are framed can change the results of polls.

00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.460
For instance, respondents are much more favorable to policies that "promote free trade"

00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:49.860
than those which "destroy American jobs".

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.460
So I want to leave you with the question we started with:

00:08:51.460 --> 00:08:56.540
In an American democracy, how much should public opinion matter in terms of the way the country is actually governed?

00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:58.880
Has your answer changed now that you have more of a sense of how informed,

00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.800
or uninformed, Americans are about politics?

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:03.540
Did you even have an answer before?
Are you even listening?

00:09:03.540 --> 00:09:06.660
And if you think that politicians are right to respond to the public's desires,

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:09.900
are you convinced that our public leaders have a good sense of what Americans really want?

00:09:09.900 --> 00:09:13.180
I'd be interested to know if your own opinions on these questions change over time.

00:09:13.180 --> 00:09:17.400
But polling's expensive, so just let us know in the comments. Thanks for watching. See you next time.

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:21.340
Crash Course Government and Politics is produced in association with PBS Digital Studios.
