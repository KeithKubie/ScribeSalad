SPEAKER:  Hello.  

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:18.103
SPEAKER:  Hello, friends.  Hi, 
welcome boys and girls, ladies 

00:00:18.261 --> 00:00:22.125
and gentlemen.  Welcome to the 
grand opening at the young

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:35.745
 Readers Center.  We have 
excitement.  We have Batman in 

00:00:36.042 --> 00:00:42.783
the house.  We have Harry 
Potter.  This is an exciting 

00:00:42.902 --> 00:00:47.049
time.  We are live from the 
Library of Congress right in 

00:00:47.173 --> 00:00:51.477
Washington, D.C. in the 
Jefferson building in the young 

00:00:51.743 --> 00:00:53.016
Readers Center but but what but 
what is

00:00:53.017 --> 00:00:58.089
 so exciting is that we are here
 on a Saturday morning.  This is

00:00:58.090 --> 00:01:06.549
 the first time that the young 
Leaders Center in the Library of

00:01:07.064 --> 00:01:11.384
 Congress, we're going to have 
more people coming from the 

00:01:12.287 --> 00:01:18.020
phones ringing.  We have got a 
live author here a book.  We 

00:01:18.607 --> 00:01:26.902
have teenagers with their 
outfits on.  For the first time 

00:01:27.316 --> 00:01:32.239
ever that this young Leader 
Center has been open on 

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:35.741
Saturday.  We are also live 
streaming.  I think that's what 

00:01:36.111 --> 00:01:42.079
it's called.  Live streaming to 
four cities and we practice 

00:01:43.159 --> 00:01:48.720
saying hello to you guys in four
 cities.  

00:01:51.948 --> 00:01:56.362
Richmond, New York, Cambridge 
and South Carolina.  

00:01:56.363 --> 00:02:05.401
And the orange county library 
Chikawa branch in Orlando, 

00:02:05.402 --> 00:02:11.399
Florida.  And the Princeton 
Public Library in Princeton, New

00:02:12.363 --> 00:02:16.212
 Jersey.  Hey Princeton.  And 
last but certainly not least, 

00:02:16.335 --> 00:02:22.012
the St. Agnus Library Branch on 
Amsterdam Avenue in New York 

00:02:22.423 --> 00:02:28.246
City.  Yay.  All right.  Now, 
this was so exciting.  They had 

00:02:28.474 --> 00:02:32.158
to write down everything that 
I'm supposed to say.  So if you 

00:02:32.779 --> 00:02:39.462

are on YouTube, on YouTube, you 

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:49.266

Everybody got that?  
#CelebrateYoungReaders well.  

00:02:51.491 --> 00:02:55.572
Throughout the day, all day on 
Saturday, I mean this is 

00:02:55.885 --> 00:02:58.470
something on Saturday.  We are 
going to have all kinds of 

00:02:58.843 --> 00:03:02.066
things.  And some of you have 
already been doing things, 

00:03:03.183 --> 00:03:07.653
making book marks.  And we have 
got shoes that are lighting up. 

00:03:09.046 --> 00:03:11.046
Put your foot up.  I might have 
to take a nap nap after

00:03:13.786 --> 00:03:18.143
 this.  I know.  We might all 
have to take a nap.  We're going

00:03:18.324 --> 00:03:20.968
 to have snacks.  It's going to 
be good. 

00:03:20.969 --> 00:03:25.066
It's just good.  I mentioned 
though that to start us off we 

00:03:25.195 --> 00:03:32.274
have a special guest, an award 
winning author, Ms. Meg Medina. 

00:03:35.070 --> 00:03:38.376
[Applause].  And she is going to
 talk about her new book in 

00:03:38.499 --> 00:03:42.442
English and Spanish and she is 
going to take us in.  I'm going 

00:03:42.581 --> 00:03:46.368
to forward over to Ms. Meg.  
Take it away.  

00:03:46.369 --> 00:03:52.162
SPEAKER:  Well, good morning, 
everybody.  Buenos dias.  A 

00:03:52.707 --> 00:03:54.335
couple of things before we we 
start we start reading. 

00:03:54.336 --> 00:03:57.281
 Because we have to -- 
we're in the library, so we're 

00:03:57.417 --> 00:04:00.656
going to have a story time, all 
of us together.  But first I 

00:04:00.862 --> 00:04:04.578
want to say how exciting it is 
to be at the Library of Congress

00:04:04.877 --> 00:04:12.545
 in a room especially for young 
people with our brand new and 

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:15.830
wonderful Librarian of Congress

00:04:18.656 --> 00:04:25.471
 Dr. Carla Hayden.  Thank you 
for making the library a 

00:04:25.472 --> 00:04:28.688
welcoming place for everybody. 
SPEAKER:  Don't forget now, 

00:04:28.909 --> 00:04:32.062
those people in the back.  
SPEAKER:  All those adults back 

00:04:32.331 --> 00:04:36.549
there.  They are always a 
problem, the adults.  

00:04:36.550 --> 00:04:40.076
SPEAKER:  I want to give a shout
 out because some of you know my

00:04:41.184 --> 00:04:43.184
 work and I write for kids in

00:04:48.125 --> 00:04:52.746
 6 and 7 and I also write for 
kids that are 10, 11, 12, 13, 

00:04:52.935 --> 00:04:59.539
14, 15 and 16.  Just this month 
a book came out called "Flying 

00:04:59.540 --> 00:05:05.523
Lessons And Other Stories" and 
it's for kids in elementary.  

00:05:05.524 --> 00:05:09.594
It's a collection of stories 
written by kids from all 

00:05:09.595 --> 00:05:11.595
different backgrounds.  I have 
two special friends friends that

00:05:12.509 --> 00:05:17.282
 came to the library and they 
are all ready to tell you about 

00:05:17.283 --> 00:05:25.594
the book.  One is EllenEllen Owe
 who is back there.  

00:05:25.595 --> 00:05:28.197
Please make sure that you talk 
to Ms. 

00:05:32.425 --> 00:05:35.730
Ellen about the book and all 
other fascinating people.  

00:05:35.731 --> 00:05:40.042
Next to Ellen is my other good 
friend, Lamar 

00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:47.426
Jiles and he will be the editor 
of the next book in that series,

00:05:48.078 --> 00:05:50.078
 instead of middle grade 
stories, it's it's going

00:05:50.401 --> 00:05:55.695
 to be YA stories, meaning 
stories for teens.  So be on the

00:05:56.075 --> 00:06:05.135
 look out for "Flying Lessons 
And Other Stories" but we have 

00:06:05.376 --> 00:06:08.019
business to tend to this morning
 my friends.  Raise your hand if

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:11.383
 you have a grandma or grandpa? 

00:06:11.384 --> 00:06:17.576
Raise your hand if you have an 
abuela or abuelo.  Yes, I did 

00:06:17.743 --> 00:06:20.777
too.  And here is what I 
remember about that experience. 

00:06:21.318 --> 00:06:25.170
That when I was 5, do I have 
anybody who is 5 here -- do this

00:06:25.328 --> 00:06:30.969
 if you are 5?  Okay.  When I 
was 5, my abuela came to live 

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:36.611
with us.  My abuela and my tia, 
they came from Cuba and I hadn't

00:06:37.110 --> 00:06:41.918
 met them before.  And I was 
very worried about them.  So all

00:06:42.079 --> 00:06:46.862
 these years later when I grew 
up, I decided, you know what, 

00:06:47.059 --> 00:06:51.971
I'm going to write a story about
 a girl and her grandmother, her

00:06:52.252 --> 00:06:57.138
 abuela and they're going to 
have a very special problem that

00:06:57.464 --> 00:07:02.682
 my grandmother and I sort of 
had, and that's it, that abuela 

00:07:02.683 --> 00:07:06.338
spoke Spanish really well and 
really quickly and it sounded to

00:07:07.081 --> 00:07:12.204
 me like this, blah blah blah.  
And

00:07:15.742 --> 00:07:20.433
 I spoke English really well and
 really quickly and it sounded 

00:07:20.434 --> 00:07:22.801
to her like this, blah blah 
blah.  

00:07:22.802 --> 00:07:26.455
And when we met each other and 
we wanted to be friends, we were

00:07:26.609 --> 00:07:28.609
 like 

00:07:30.262 --> 00:07:33.146
uh-oh.  I wrote a book.  
Here is the deal with this book.

00:07:33.346 --> 00:07:38.469
Right now I speak Spanish and 
English.  So I'm going to read 

00:07:39.494 --> 00:07:42.823
the book both ways and on this 
screen you're going to have the 

00:07:43.014 --> 00:07:44.049
pictures and you're going to 
have the words in English.  And 

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.050
And in And in my

00:07:46.703 --> 00:07:53.428
 lap, I have the book in 
espanol.  So we're going to have

00:07:53.553 --> 00:07:57.706
 to be patient which is a really
 good quality when we're talking

00:07:57.846 --> 00:08:03.900
 about people who speak other 
languages.  So when I'm reading 

00:08:04.241 --> 00:08:08.549
in English, the folks who are 
live streaming, watching the 

00:08:08.880 --> 00:08:12.650
live stream, listening to this 
wanting to hear it in Spanish.  

00:08:13.009 --> 00:08:16.024
They're going to wait really 
patiently and when I finish 

00:08:16.169 --> 00:08:18.796
English and go to Spanish, 
you're going to wait really 

00:08:19.311 --> 00:08:21.538
patiently and look at the 
pictures drawn by my friend 

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:23.700
Angela 

00:08:45.367 --> 00:08:53.812
Dominguez. Dominguez.  Are you 
ready?  I need a person with a 

00:08:41.055 --> 00:08:43.055
long arm.  

00:08:47.161 --> 00:08:50.556
Gracias.  Thank you. 
So this will be a trick.  I 

00:08:50.681 --> 00:08:54.383
never done it this way.  

00:08:58.097 --> 00:09:02.829
Remember the word patience.  
What happened?  I hit the end, 

00:09:03.020 --> 00:09:06.863
I'm going backward.  Hold on, 
I'm going all of the way 

00:09:07.183 --> 00:09:11.603
backward, backward.  There we 

00:09:14.636 --> 00:09:19.764
go.  "Mango, Abuela and Me" by 
Meg Medina.  She comes to us in 

00:09:20.228 --> 00:09:26.991
winter, leaving behind her sunny
 house that rested between two 

00:09:27.522 --> 00:09:31.313
snakey rivers.  Her old place 
was too much for just one as 

00:09:31.699 --> 00:09:35.251
mommy tells me, as we make room 
in my dresser for her clothes 

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:44.285
and too far away for us to talk.
Abuela belongs with us now, but 

00:09:44.771 --> 00:09:52.091
I still feel shy when I meet 
this far away grandmother.  

00:09:52.092 --> 00:09:54.092
[Speaking

00:10:00.814 --> 00:10:03.388
 Spanish]. 

00:11:33.423 --> 00:12:22.396
 Flies it right next to mine.  
You get to know each other she 

00:10:48.583 --> 00:10:55.536
says.  When I show abuela my new
 book, she cannot see the 

00:10:55.537 --> 00:10:58.623
English words.  
We can watch the pictures.  But 

00:10:58.981 --> 00:11:03.432
just before we turn out the 
light, she pulls out two things 

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:07.198
tucked inside the satin pocket 
of her 

00:11:10.352 --> 00:11:15.645
suitcase, a feather.  
From a wild parrot that stood in

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:24.611
 her mango trees and a snapshot 
of a young man with papi's 

00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:26.750
smile.  Abuelo she she says

00:11:29.480 --> 00:11:36.381
 climbing into bed, snuggled 
with flowers and sugar in her 

00:11:36.382 --> 00:11:40.905
hair and sugar and cinnamon 
baking in her skin and then I 

00:11:40.906 --> 00:11:45.216
dream of a red bird circling the
 sky.  [Speaking

00:12:58.797 --> 00:13:00.127
Spanish].  The rest of the  
winter while winter while mami

00:13:00.128 --> 00:13:07.152
 and papi are at work, abuela 
waits for me to get home from 

00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:13.142
school.  We then bundle up in 
thick socks and sweaters to toss

00:13:13.486 --> 00:13:15.486
 bread to to the to the 

00:13:17.449 --> 00:13:23.485
sparrows.  Not good enough to 
tell abuela the things she 

00:13:23.842 --> 00:13:27.346
should know like how I am very 
good in art and I can run as 

00:13:28.474 --> 00:13:30.821
fast as the boys.  [Speaking

00:14:56.416 --> 00:15:48.190
Spanish].  And her English to 
tell me the stories about all I 

00:14:08.775 --> 00:14:13.868
want to know about abuela and 
the rivers that ran right 

00:14:14.674 --> 00:14:18.326
outside their door, with our 
mouths as empty as our bread 

00:14:18.509 --> 00:14:24.783
baskets, we walked back tomorrow
 and watched TV.  [Speaking 

00:15:10.103 --> 00:15:32.586
Spanish].  Abuela and I cannot 
understand each other I 

00:14:51.286 --> 00:14:56.418
whispered to mommy.  Oh, things 
will get matter mommy says.  

00:14:56.943 --> 00:14:59.760
Remember how it was with Kim?  
Kim is my very best friend

00:15:02.778 --> 00:15:08.046
 at school.  When she was new, 
our whole class had to help 

00:15:08.047 --> 00:15:13.169
teacher English words.  And now 
sometimes has to say, please be 

00:15:13.597 --> 00:15:23.193
quiet girls.  Others are 
working.  Sound familiar?  

00:15:23.194 --> 00:15:25.194
[Speaking Spanish]

00:16:53.344 --> 00:17:42.382
 after the next day, while 
abuela and I are making meat 

00:16:08.039 --> 00:16:10.902
pies for our snack, I pretend 
that I am Ms.

00:16:19.536 --> 00:16:27.717
to the ball.  Abuela says dough?
Masa?  And roles it flat.  Masa 

00:16:27.718 --> 00:16:29.718
I

00:16:30.791 --> 00:16:39.658
 say.  She drops in place.  
Carne, carne.  I say meat. 

00:16:45.895 --> 00:16:51.721
I'm going to skip in espanol 
because you get it.  And then I 

00:16:52.286 --> 00:16:53.990
remember the word cards we taped
 in our classroom to help Kim. 

00:16:53.991 --> 00:16:55.991
Kim.  
So

00:16:57.394 --> 00:16:59.599
 while abuela fries our

00:17:02.825 --> 00:17:06.944
 empanadas I put word cards 
until everything is covered.  

00:17:06.945 --> 00:17:14.577
Soon we are playing over here 
and say or around the house.  

00:17:14.578 --> 00:17:22.662
She still calls my pillow a 
pallow and says Edward and a 

00:17:23.954 --> 00:17:25.954
monster.  
[Speaking Spanish]

00:18:12.018 --> 00:18:17.779
 sorry, but the next day I 
cannot practice with abuela 

00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:23.281
after all.  Edmond has run out 
of his favorite seed.  So mommy 

00:18:23.282 --> 00:18:28.648
and I have to ride the bus 
downtown to get more.  Sometimes

00:18:28.788 --> 00:18:33.236
 there kittens in the pet shop 
window, but when we arrive, 

00:18:33.237 --> 00:18:36.603
something even better is behind 
the class.  [Speaking 

00:19:58.992 --> 00:20:48.253
Spanish].  Look I say, the 
window has become a jungle 

00:19:13.331 --> 00:19:19.990
filled with birds and right in 
the middle is a parrot at us 

00:19:20.179 --> 00:19:23.621
with black bead eyes.  I press 
my nose to the glass thinking of

00:19:23.779 --> 00:19:29.384
 the feather abuela gave me.  
Let's buy him I tell mommy.  But

00:19:29.521 --> 00:19:34.237
 you already have Edmond mommy 
says.  But I say no, it's not 

00:19:34.983 --> 00:19:40.806
for me.  It's for abuela.  Like 
the parrot that lived in the 

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:45.561
mango trees, he can keep her 
company while I'm in school.  

00:19:46.214 --> 00:19:48.214
[Speaking Spanish]. 

00:20:34.515 --> 00:20:36.515
 When we bring him home, to

00:20:39.211 --> 00:20:39.821
 abuela, she she  she says

00:20:39.822 --> 00:20:46.598
 oh, look a parrot.  And we 
named him mango because his 

00:20:46.767 --> 00:20:53.273
wings are green and orange and 
gold like the fruit.  During the

00:20:55.655 --> 00:21:02.002
 day, abuela teaches him kisses 
and bobs his head when she sings

00:21:04.092 --> 00:21:07.052
 to him.  Mango, abuela says 
opening the door when I get home

00:21:07.257 --> 00:21:13.300
 from school.  Good afternoon I 
say and give him a seed.  Mango 

00:21:13.914 --> 00:21:20.119
calls to me even before we open 
the cage.  Buenos tardes.  When 

00:21:20.246 --> 00:21:23.330
I open the door, he says good 
afternoon.  [Speaking

00:22:21.569 --> 00:22:23.950
 Spanish]. 
Abuela, Mango and I practice new

00:22:24.543 --> 00:22:30.260
 words every day in espanol and 
it's faster and faster and 

00:22:30.827 --> 00:22:35.733
abuela and Mango learn the days 
of the week, the coins, how do 

00:22:36.364 --> 00:22:38.364
they learn all

00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:42.110
 that

00:22:44.875 --> 00:22:51.772
 is asked what abuela can do.  
Give a piece of banana.  She 

00:22:51.773 --> 00:22:53.773
says -- 
[speaking Spanish]

00:24:22.903 --> 00:25:13.030
 beforelong, abuela asks me how 
to say harder things too so she 

00:23:37.042 --> 00:23:41.906
can talk to the neighbors that 
stop by.  

00:23:41.907 --> 00:23:48.916
Come today.  It is chilly today.
Can I get you some cookies and 

00:23:50.545 --> 00:23:52.545
lemonade?  Soon when

00:23:55.310 --> 00:24:00.133
 friends stop by to see Mango's 
latest tricks, they can 

00:24:00.134 --> 00:24:02.868
understand everything that 
abuela says.  

00:24:02.869 --> 00:24:04.869
[Speaking Spanish]. 

00:24:24.048 --> 00:24:34.848
 It is chilly today.  Can I get 
you some cookies It is chilly 

00:24:17.381 --> 00:24:20.305
today.  Can I get you some 
cookies and lemonade?  

00:24:20.306 --> 00:24:22.306
[Speaking Spanish]. 

00:24:28.008 --> 00:24:32.118
 But best of all, now when 
abuela and I are lying next to 

00:24:32.119 --> 00:24:38.044
each other in our beds, our 
mouths are full of things to 

00:24:38.320 --> 00:24:40.811
say.  I tell her about my

00:24:45.894 --> 00:24:51.781
 buendia and show her Mango and 
abuela reads my book only with 

00:24:51.782 --> 00:24:55.723
little help and she tells me 
stories about abuelo who can die

00:24:55.724 --> 00:24:56.088
 fromdie from riverdie from 
river stones

00:24:56.089 --> 00:25:01.329
 with a single breath.  I draw 
pictures for her.  She misses 

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:05.021
their old house she says, but 
now only a little bit.  

00:25:05.418 --> 00:25:07.418
[Speaking Spanish].

00:25:57.137 --> 00:26:04.457
Mango listens to us from his 
porch until my eyes grow heavy. 

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:09.161
I say abuela kisses me good 

00:26:13.139 --> 00:26:17.344
night mia.  Good night Mango 
calls and soon we fall asleep.  

00:26:17.634 --> 00:26:19.634
[Speaking

00:27:11.565 --> 00:27:23.112
 Spanish].  [Applause]..
SPEAKER:  Do you think it would 

00:27:03.751 --> 00:27:06.613
be nice for the library to have 
a Mango right here?  I like 

00:27:09.115 --> 00:27:15.224
Edmond.  I like Edmond on that 
wheel too, that poor little 

00:27:16.523 --> 00:27:18.486
gangster hamster.  Do you have 
any questions?  We have 

00:27:18.487 --> 00:27:21.046
questions from our friends all 
over the country.  So we're 

00:27:21.542 --> 00:27:25.948
going to start asking, anybody 
have a question?  Like was 

00:27:27.550 --> 00:27:31.089
Edmond really a hamster or a 

00:27:35.641 --> 00:27:38.280
ganggangster?  A gangster 
hamster. 

00:27:38.281 --> 00:27:42.969
SPEAKER:  If anybody has had a 
hamster, they know they are 

00:27:42.970 --> 00:27:47.010
gangsters.  They try to get out 
of the cage and steal the seeds 

00:27:47.533 --> 00:27:50.161
and stuff them in the cage.  
SPEAKER:  How about we start off

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:54.342
 with one of our friends tuning 
in today.  We will start off 

00:27:54.925 --> 00:27:59.010
with Colombia, South Carolina.  
We have Jayla asking Meg Medina,

00:27:59.438 --> 00:28:05.706
 was it hard to learn English 
and Spanish?  Spanish?   

00:27:56.836 --> 00:27:58.836
Spanish?  
SPEAKER: 

00:28:02.649 --> 00:28:10.483
 Hi, Jayla.  Thank you for 
asking that question.  It wasn't

00:28:10.484 --> 00:28:14.848
 for me because when I was 
little, my mother spoke to me at

00:28:14.966 --> 00:28:22.153
 home in Spanish.  And I spent 
all day in school speaking 

00:28:22.945 --> 00:28:27.681
English.  And so I learned from 
the time that I was very little,

00:28:27.887 --> 00:28:32.913
 that speaking two languages was
 just having more words.  And so

00:28:33.151 --> 00:28:38.178
 the only confusing part that 
happens still sometimes now, is 

00:28:38.619 --> 00:28:41.154
that there are some things that 
you can really say well in 

00:28:41.353 --> 00:28:44.578
English or really say well in 
Spanish, that doesn't have a 

00:28:45.101 --> 00:28:48.733
good translation in the other 
language.  Like for example, 

00:28:49.851 --> 00:28:54.635
I'll give you this one.  In 
Spanish, in Cuban in particular 

00:28:54.992 --> 00:29:02.772
if they say, boy that's crazy.  
They say -- [speaking Spanish] 

00:29:02.929 --> 00:29:08.937
-- which means that you throw 
the Mango really far.  Can you 

00:29:08.938 --> 00:29:15.873
imagine if I went around saying 
boy, you got to throw the Mango 

00:29:16.049 --> 00:29:21.967
a little far my friends.  I 
think my American friends would 

00:29:22.099 --> 00:29:25.969
say she is loco in the coco. 

00:29:41.250 --> 00:29:43.767
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Why do people 
get Mango?  

00:29:43.768 --> 00:29:47.452
SPEAKER:  Why do people get 
Mango in the story?  I think she

00:29:48.594 --> 00:29:51.943
 wanted to make her grandmother 
feel better about missing her 

00:29:52.130 --> 00:29:55.486
house.  Sometimes when we move 
to a new place we miss our old 

00:29:55.626 --> 00:29:58.752
place.  Raise your hand if you 
ever had to move from one place 

00:29:59.002 --> 00:30:03.201
to another.  Yeah.  That can be 
scary.  And you want to remember

00:30:03.333 --> 00:30:08.445
 the good things that the place 
that you came from.  So I think 

00:30:08.645 --> 00:30:10.645
Mango was a help er

00:30:13.778 --> 00:30:17.496
 to help them talk to each other
 but also a helper to make 

00:30:17.497 --> 00:30:21.857
abuela feel at home.  That's 
something that we can do when we

00:30:21.858 --> 00:30:25.839
 have new people come to our 
classrooms, new people come to 

00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:30.666
our neighborhoods, new people 
come to our family.  We want to 

00:30:30.667 --> 00:30:32.667
make them feel

00:30:38.654 --> 00:30:40.654
 loved and safe. 

00:30:46.673 --> 00:30:49.165
 We have a question from other 
one of our friends.  This friend

00:30:50.317 --> 00:30:55.257
 is named Emily, she is 9 and 
she has a question from orange 

00:30:56.131 --> 00:31:00.926
County Library System in Orlando
 Friday.  This is for Dr. 

00:31:03.111 --> 00:31:04.880
Hayden, what what does what does
 the

00:31:04.881 --> 00:31:09.614
 librarian do?  
[Laughter].  She is back folks. 

00:31:10.704 --> 00:31:17.151
SPEAKER:  Well, I'm so glad that
 you asked, Emily.  I was born 

00:31:17.152 --> 00:31:21.740
in Florida, Tallahassee, hey.  
And I know about moving.  And 

00:31:21.741 --> 00:31:24.901
what a librarian gets to do is 
have fun like today when you can

00:31:25.626 --> 00:31:30.656
 do things and show people what 
fun reading is, and meet authors

00:31:30.861 --> 00:31:37.116
 like Ms. Medina and you get to 
pick books for other people to 

00:31:37.558 --> 00:31:43.411
read and I get to have excuses 
to read.  It is one of the best 

00:31:45.767 --> 00:31:49.063
things you can do I think but 
being a librarian is all about 

00:31:49.274 --> 00:31:51.759
meeting and letting people find 
out about things and helping 

00:31:51.938 --> 00:31:57.115
them find out about things.  So 
it's a pretty cool job.

00:31:57.116 --> 00:32:00.373
SPEAKER:  Do you know if it I 
wasn't a writer and I also was 

00:32:00.374 --> 00:32:04.764
not a dancer in my next life, I 
would like to come back dancing,

00:32:07.167 --> 00:32:10.465
 I would love to be a librarian 
because my librarian, even now 

00:32:10.744 --> 00:32:13.459
-- maybe this happens to you, do
 you go to the library sometimes

00:32:13.662 --> 00:32:15.581
 and you don't know what to 
read?

00:32:15.582 --> 00:32:17.582
It I

00:32:18.829 --> 00:32:23.115
  go to the expert.  And I say 
what's new, what is good?  

00:32:23.116 --> 00:32:27.486
And they always give me the best
 advice and the other thing that

00:32:27.871 --> 00:32:32.555
 I love about librarians is that
 it's like they're opening a 

00:32:32.849 --> 00:32:37.548
magic door for me to walk 
through.  And experience the 

00:32:37.738 --> 00:32:40.814
story.  So I'm so glad that 
you're a librarian and there are

00:32:40.943 --> 00:32:44.682
 so many good librarians out 
there.  Thank you librarians.  

00:32:44.683 --> 00:32:46.683
[Applause]. 

00:33:04.712 --> 00:33:13.614
 of  
SPEAKER:  Librarians are wizards

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:04.358
 of words, like Harry Potter.  
It's just a joy.  We have more 

00:33:04.529 --> 00:33:05.901
questions. 
SPEAKER:  We have questions 

00:33:05.902 --> 00:33:09.649
streaming in today from Maddy, 6
 years old and she is in 

00:33:10.354 --> 00:33:16.264
Princeton.  Maddy says I read 
every day, do you?  

00:33:16.265 --> 00:33:18.265
SPEAKER:  Yes. 
SPEAKER:  I'm never not reading.

00:33:18.343 --> 00:33:22.872
I would love it, love it.  In 
fact, when I don't read, I don't

00:33:23.086 --> 00:33:26.084
 feel well.  Does that happen to
 you?  

00:33:26.085 --> 00:33:29.107
SPEAKER:  When I'm really really
 tired, I can tell I'm really 

00:33:29.454 --> 00:33:31.640
really tired because I can't 
read.  And that's when I know I 

00:33:31.858 --> 00:33:36.159
need to take that nap, I need to
 do something because I love to 

00:33:36.441 --> 00:33:41.133
read.  Well can I tell you one 
of my favorite places to read?  

00:33:41.134 --> 00:33:42.769
In bed.  
SPEAKER:  Me too. 

00:33:42.770 --> 00:33:45.782
SPEAKER:  It's the best thing.  
And sometimes I wake up and 

00:33:46.258 --> 00:33:51.001
there are books and magazines 
and stuff in the bed with me.  

00:33:51.300 --> 00:33:54.086
And it's so cool.  
SPEAKER:  You know, I had a 

00:33:55.374 --> 00:33:59.684
neighbor once, her name was Liz 
and she had three little kids 

00:33:59.685 --> 00:34:04.542
and one of her daughters, I 
remembered that young woman is 

00:34:04.822 --> 00:34:09.232
in her 20s now but as a little 
girl, she can only go to sleep 

00:34:09.345 --> 00:34:13.578
if her bed was filled with books
 and she read until the moments 

00:34:14.255 --> 00:34:18.054
her eyed dropped and she would 
wake up in the morning touching 

00:34:19.095 --> 00:34:23.203
those books. I think her name 
was Kate if I'm not mistaken.  I

00:34:23.204 --> 00:34:25.092
 will always remember that.  I  
I read in I read in 

00:34:25.093 --> 00:34:31.145
bed, too.  It's such a comfort. 
 I like going to sleep with my 

00:34:32.254 --> 00:34:32.746
imagination. 
SPEAKER:  Sometimes it's better 

00:34:32.747 --> 00:34:36.859
than a movie because the movie 
is in your head and you can make

00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:38.860
 up whatever you want.  So So 
it's

00:34:39.368 --> 00:34:44.387
 really kind of cool.  Another 
question?  Oh, right here. 

00:34:50.269 --> 00:34:52.269
 You can just stay stuff, too. 

00:35:02.848 --> 00:35:05.907
speak Spanish in the book?  
SPEAKER:  Why did she want to 

00:35:06.079 --> 00:35:09.531
learn to speak Spanish?  She 
wanted to be able to talk to her

00:35:13.369 --> 00:35:14.869
 grandma.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  I mean why did

00:35:14.870 --> 00:35:19.904
 you decide to do the book in 
Spanish?  

00:35:19.905 --> 00:35:24.110
SPEAKER:  Oh, my.  A question.  
SPEAKER:  That's right.  She got

00:35:24.599 --> 00:35:27.822
 the story.  
SPEAKER:  Thank you for that 

00:35:28.331 --> 00:35:30.331
clarification.  Well, thank you 
very much.  That's a really good

00:35:30.513 --> 00:35:35.785
 question.  And here is why.  
Because I think that there are a

00:35:36.248 --> 00:35:41.960
 lot of kids in the U.S. who 
speak English and Spanish and 

00:35:41.961 --> 00:35:47.206
lots of families where some of 
the people speak English and 

00:35:47.418 --> 00:35:51.656
some of the people speak Spanish
 and I like to give them books 

00:35:51.967 --> 00:35:55.136
where no matter what language 
they're most comfortable in, 

00:35:55.137 --> 00:35:59.965
they can come together around 
the story.  The hard part, when 

00:36:00.329 --> 00:36:02.181
I'm reading, is waiting.  Right?
It's hard to be patient.  And 

00:36:02.182 --> 00:36:04.182
And  And that's

00:36:05.223 --> 00:36:10.415
 true when we're reading books 
in true formats.  It's true when

00:36:10.416 --> 00:36:13.748
 someone is new to English and 
they're trying to talk to you 

00:36:13.749 --> 00:36:17.247
and you're listening really 
carefully and trying to be 

00:36:17.248 --> 00:36:20.250
patient.  But they're trying to 
tell you their story.  Even if 

00:36:20.251 --> 00:36:25.721
it's a sentence, that they want 
to tell you.  So it's, for me, I

00:36:26.713 --> 00:36:32.922
 like including everybody that I
 can in the story.  Good answer?

00:36:32.923 --> 00:36:36.531
  [Laughter].  
SPEAKER:  We have a question 

00:36:36.783 --> 00:36:39.184
over here.  
SPEAKER:  And we need more 

00:36:39.536 --> 00:36:42.095
stories in other languages, too.
SPEAKER:  Go ahead and ask your 

00:36:42.416 --> 00:36:44.416
question. 

00:36:50.130 --> 00:36:57.553
give it to the grandma?  
SPEAKER:  Say that question one 

00:36:57.990 --> 00:36:59.990
more time.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Why did they 

00:37:00.083 --> 00:37:03.820
give a hamster to the grandma?  
SPEAKER:  Why was there a ham

00:37:05.225 --> 00:37:10.386
hamster in the story?  Well I'm 
not doing well with interpreting

00:37:11.455 --> 00:37:13.455
 the questions.  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Why did she 

00:37:13.882 --> 00:37:16.948
give it to grandma?  
SPEAKER:  Well, she already had 

00:37:18.015 --> 00:37:23.380
Edmond.  She already owned him. 
Edmond was her pet.  So she 

00:37:23.507 --> 00:37:30.594
wanted to add Mango the parrot. 
She didn't add Edmond.  Edmond 

00:37:30.786 --> 00:37:33.362
was already hers.  Do you have a
 pet?  

00:37:33.363 --> 00:37:36.072
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Yeah.  
SPEAKER:  What do you have?  

00:37:36.803 --> 00:37:39.482
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  A dog.  
SPEAKER:  Me too.  What is your 

00:37:39.652 --> 00:37:42.852
dog's name?  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Onnix.  

00:37:42.853 --> 00:37:50.266
SPEAKER:  My dog's name is Hugo 
and he is a big black Shaggy 

00:37:50.655 --> 00:37:53.379
dog.  What does your dog look 
like?  

00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.769
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  He is black 
and he has light brown feet. 

00:37:57.944 --> 00:38:03.895
SPEAKER:  He must be beautiful 
and I like that name, Oxxin.  

00:38:04.147 --> 00:38:07.627
Any other questions?  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Well just like

00:38:07.825 --> 00:38:13.988
 her dog, her dog's name is 
Onnix and my dog's name is 

00:38:17.272 --> 00:38:20.564
Donnix.  
SPEAKER:  And we got one 

00:38:20.718 --> 00:38:22.718
question over 

00:38:23.869 --> 00:38:26.581
here?  
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Why did you 

00:38:26.776 --> 00:38:30.568
read two books?  
SPEAKER:  Why did I?  I think 

00:38:30.701 --> 00:38:35.270
because I can't not do it.  When
 I don't write, I don't feel 

00:38:35.271 --> 00:38:39.625
very well.  So I love to write 
stories.  When I was little, I 

00:38:40.857 --> 00:38:44.408
loved to hear stories.  And as 
an adult, I still like to hear 

00:38:44.561 --> 00:38:47.195
stories and I like to read 
stories but now I like to write 

00:38:47.424 --> 00:38:51.639
them also.  Do you like to write
 stories?  Yes.  So you know 

00:38:51.640 --> 00:38:56.874
what happens to people like you?
  You become people like me or 

00:38:56.875 --> 00:39:00.766
people like Dr. Hayden.  Book 
lovers.  

00:39:00.767 --> 00:39:03.546
We become librarians and 
authors.  If you like to draw 

00:39:04.526 --> 00:39:08.272
the pictures, we can become 
illustrators, the person who 

00:39:08.418 --> 00:39:15.111
draws in the story.  So there is
 lots of stuff for book-loving 

00:39:15.346 --> 00:39:22.409
people.  
SPEAKER:  Batman, yes?  

00:39:22.410 --> 00:39:24.757
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Why is grandma
 in the story?  

00:39:24.758 --> 00:39:26.758
SPEAKER:  Why did I write a  
story with story with a

00:39:27.708 --> 00:39:33.600
 grandma in it?  I like 
grandmas.  I think grandmas and 

00:39:33.601 --> 00:39:37.417
grandpas and aunts and uncles, I
 think family is really 

00:39:37.418 --> 00:39:43.759
important.  So I love to write 
stories where we get to see 

00:39:44.256 --> 00:39:48.367
people's families.  And there 
are all types of families too.  

00:39:48.368 --> 00:39:50.606
That's what I have learned.  
There are all kinds of families 

00:39:50.817 --> 00:39:54.530
and it doesn't matter.  And it's
 really cool to have all types 

00:39:54.531 --> 00:40:03.333
of people in the family.  I had 
a rabbit in the family. 

00:40:05.266 --> 00:40:06.996
 Everybody can be in the family.

00:40:06.997 --> 00:40:09.504
SPEAKER:  We have another 
question.  This is a question 

00:40:09.829 --> 00:40:18.931
from Zeekie who is 7 years old 
and in Orange County Public 

00:40:20.594 --> 00:40:21.853
System in Orlando Orlando  
Orlando Florida. 

00:40:21.854 --> 00:40:23.891
 How many books are in your 
library? 

00:40:23.892 --> 00:40:27.319
SPEAKER:  I know that one.  And 
there are -- think about this.  

00:40:27.577 --> 00:40:31.941
That's why we are so excited 
that you're going to be here 

00:40:31.942 --> 00:40:34.659
more and more and more.  32 
million books. 

00:40:37.723 --> 00:40:41.927
 Just books.  And there are -- I
 even -- it's so much to even 

00:40:41.928 --> 00:40:47.412
say how much.  100 million other
 things.  Comic books, games, 

00:40:47.413 --> 00:40:49.413
all types of

00:40:51.924 --> 00:40:56.250
 photos.  Everything.  That's a 
lot of stuff, isn't it?  

00:40:56.251 --> 00:40:58.544
SPEAKER:  Thank goodness you 
have it.  Because when I write 

00:40:59.029 --> 00:41:02.829
books, I come to the library to 
do research. So I came to this 

00:41:03.064 --> 00:41:05.734
library, the Library of 
Congress, when I was writing -- 

00:41:06.102 --> 00:41:11.320
I have a novel called "Burn Baby
 Burn" for teenagers and I came 

00:41:11.904 --> 00:41:14.340
right across the street and 
spent a lot of time doing 

00:41:14.532 --> 00:41:16.915
research here.  And the other 
thing that I don't know that 

00:41:17.310 --> 00:41:18.590
they can see, but maybe maybe 
they

00:41:18.591 --> 00:41:21.321
 can do a virtual tour on the 
website.  

00:41:21.322 --> 00:41:23.318
SPEAKER:  We are working on 
that. 

00:41:23.319 --> 00:41:25.319
SPEAKER:  To see how beautiful 
the Library of Congress is.  

00:41:25.595 --> 00:41:31.004
It's two buildings.  We're in 
the Jefferson building.  There 

00:41:31.153 --> 00:41:35.686
is the Madison building.  
SPEAKER:  There are three 

00:41:35.891 --> 00:41:38.226
buildings right around here.  
There is another one.  You got 

00:41:38.353 --> 00:41:41.376
to go to that one too.  
SPEAKER:  On the side.  Yeah, 

00:41:41.517 --> 00:41:47.672
there are three.  But I knew 
there were two.  The Jefferson 

00:41:48.264 --> 00:41:53.770
building, you just shouldn't 
miss it.  And you should go up 

00:41:54.089 --> 00:42:00.335
and just look at how beautiful a
 monument it is for books, and 

00:42:01.332 --> 00:42:05.365
knowing and thinking and 
learning.  And that really 

00:42:05.689 --> 00:42:07.248
matters.  
SPEAKER:  And the cool thing is 

00:42:07.249 --> 00:42:11.014
that it's your library.  This is
 everybody's

00:42:14.371 --> 00:42:18.341
 library.  So Florida and New 
Jersey and New York, this is 

00:42:18.342 --> 00:42:22.915
your library too.  And I am very
 glad you said you said about 

00:42:22.916 --> 00:42:26.632
the virtual tour, because very 
soon, you will be able to take a

00:42:26.781 --> 00:42:30.117
 tour of all three buildings.  
And there is even another one in

00:42:30.243 --> 00:42:35.121
 Virginia.  All three buildings 
you'll be able to look and it's 

00:42:35.769 --> 00:42:39.093
3D.  Wherever you are, you can 
tour the building.  

00:42:39.094 --> 00:42:42.541
SPEAKER:  Yeah.  
SPEAKER:  Great.  Now oh, look, 

00:42:42.674 --> 00:42:45.636
we must be having too much fun. 
Because now the adults want to 

00:42:45.831 --> 00:42:48.948
ask questions. 
SPEAKER:  They want to get in on

00:42:49.165 --> 00:42:55.533
 the action.  There you go.  He 
is going to ask a question.  

00:42:56.178 --> 00:42:58.464
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  What was 
President Jefferson's 

00:42:58.580 --> 00:43:01.069
involvement in establishing the 
library?  

00:43:01.070 --> 00:43:02.503
SPEAKER:  Wow, now you you can

00:43:02.504 --> 00:43:05.460
 tell that was an adult 
question.  

00:43:05.461 --> 00:43:06.710
[Laughter]. 
SPEAKER:  And I'm so glad it's 

00:43:06.711 --> 00:43:08.876
yours.  
SPEAKER:  And I happen to know 

00:43:10.035 --> 00:43:13.906
that one, too.  Because what 
this gentleman wanted to know is

00:43:14.433 --> 00:43:18.857
 why is this even called -- the 
building that we're in now is 

00:43:19.367 --> 00:43:24.748
the Thomas Jefferson building.  
And he says what was -- how was 

00:43:25.632 --> 00:43:30.146
Thomas Jefferson, he was the 
president a long time ago.  

00:43:30.147 --> 00:43:33.443
Very, very important president. 
Because he thought about a lot 

00:43:33.444 --> 00:43:36.040
of things when the country was 
getting started.  And one of the

00:43:36.441 --> 00:43:43.173
 things he says was, this is a 
new country.  It was 1796 way 

00:43:44.155 --> 00:43:47.328
back.  He said you know what a 
new country needs?  It needs a 

00:43:47.464 --> 00:43:54.534
library.  And he made sure that 
books from his library were 

00:43:54.995 --> 00:43:58.164
given to the country so we can 
have this wonderful thing now.  

00:43:58.289 --> 00:44:03.828
So thank you for asking that and
 thank you Thomas Jefferson.  We

00:44:03.829 --> 00:44:08.186
 have got another one.  
SPEAKER:  We do.  This one is 

00:44:08.322 --> 00:44:12.259
from New York.  
SPEAKER:  Other New York City.  

00:44:12.737 --> 00:44:15.290
Amsterdam Avenue. 
SPEAKER:  Queens, New York. 

00:44:15.291 --> 00:44:17.549
SPEAKER:  That's Jamaica, New 
York.  

00:44:17.550 --> 00:44:21.363
SPEAKER:  They actually want to 
know if you miss living in 

00:44:21.882 --> 00:44:24.595
Queens and the real question is,
 Jessica wants to know, is there

00:44:24.867 --> 00:44:29.451
 a difference between how you 
write chapter books and picture 

00:44:29.715 --> 00:44:31.683
books?  
SPEAKER:  Oh. 

00:44:31.684 --> 00:44:33.684
SPEAKER:  And I am from Queens. 

00:44:37.684 --> 00:44:39.766
 Flushing, Queens. 
SPEAKER:  Flushing. 

00:44:39.767 --> 00:44:41.767
SPEAKER:  Flushing, Queens is 
where I'mwhere I'm 

00:44:41.801 --> 00:44:44.664
from. There is a difference when
 you write every type of book.  

00:44:44.665 --> 00:44:46.665
You have to think about who is

00:44:48.712 --> 00:44:53.603
 reading the book and how long 
the book can be and how many 

00:44:53.604 --> 00:44:57.299
words that reader has to be able
 to unlock your story.

00:44:57.300 --> 00:45:02.786
Is somebody going to be reading 
the book with them or are they 

00:45:03.134 --> 00:45:06.577
going to be reading it by 
themselves?  There are all 

00:45:06.906 --> 00:45:09.979
things that I have to do with --
the

00:45:06.166 --> 00:45:08.166
the first
the first thing

00:45:09.343 --> 00:45:17.865
 I ask myself, what story do I 
want to tell?  

00:45:17.866 --> 00:45:21.776
The second thing is who am I 
telling it to?  And the third 

00:45:22.012 --> 00:45:25.627
thing is, what is the best way 
to tell that story to that 

00:45:25.628 --> 00:45:28.487
person?  So I have to match 
those three things up.  

00:45:28.488 --> 00:45:36.181
Sometimes I make a mistake and I
 try it in one one way one way 

00:45:24.995 --> 00:45:26.995
and

00:45:30.659 --> 00:45:35.870
 I go, no, no, it doesn't make 
sense this way.  It's much 

00:45:35.871 --> 00:45:40.931
better as a novel or as I 
picture book or whatever.  But 

00:45:40.932 --> 00:45:44.220
those three things, in some way,
 have to line up.  

00:45:44.221 --> 00:45:45.874
SPEAKER:  Wow, that takes a lot 
of thought. 

00:45:45.875 --> 00:45:48.872
SPEAKER:  It does.  It's a brain
 buster.  

00:45:48.873 --> 00:45:53.031
SPEAKER:  It looks so wonderful 
and everything.  Wait a minute, 

00:45:53.176 --> 00:45:57.642
is there a medal on that book?  
SPEAKER:  There is a medal on 

00:45:57.769 --> 00:46:00.043
that book, my friends. 
SPEAKER:  Can you tell us, 

00:46:00.755 --> 00:46:01.881
whenever you see this kind of of
  of medal

00:46:01.882 --> 00:46:07.674
 on a book, that means that it 
won a prize.  So can you tell us

00:46:08.105 --> 00:46:10.222
 about the prize?  
SPEAKER:  I can.  And I'm glad I

00:46:10.417 --> 00:46:12.761
 can tell you this with the 
question from New York.  Because

00:46:13.187 --> 00:46:22.358
 this book won a prize called 
the Fuda Honor Award.  An honor 

00:46:22.359 --> 00:46:25.818
for writing and illustration.  
And I was not the illustrator.  

00:46:25.819 --> 00:46:33.797
The illustrator is a wonderful 
woman named Angela Dominguez who

00:46:34.477 --> 00:46:36.477
 is a writer and illustrates her
 own  book. 

00:46:39.344 --> 00:46:48.728
 So find her stuff.  Was a 
librarian, the first Latina in 

00:46:49.402 --> 00:46:52.403
Harlem in the 20s.  
SPEAKER:  Yes, 1920. 

00:46:52.404 --> 00:46:55.313
SPEAKER:  Yeah.  And she looked 
out at her students and she 

00:46:55.712 --> 00:46:59.270
looked at them and looked at the
 kids who were in the pages of 

00:46:59.649 --> 00:47:05.767
the books in her library and she
 said, wait a minute, this 

00:47:06.074 --> 00:47:10.926
doesn't exactly match.  We need 
more stories and more books that

00:47:11.176 --> 00:47:17.753
 have all kinds of people in 
them.  So she dedicated her 

00:47:20.676 --> 00:47:21.656
whole life to diversifying,whole
 life to diversifying, to create

00:47:21.657 --> 00:47:25.945
 getting stories and books that 
reflect all people.

00:47:25.946 --> 00:47:32.985
And so when the book comes out 
every yearbooks publish, there 

00:47:34.501 --> 00:47:38.093
is a committee, and they read 
and read and read and they are 

00:47:38.630 --> 00:47:41.359
looking for books and celebrate 
Latino life and experience in 

00:47:41.471 --> 00:47:44.561
the United States.  And they 
pick a winner for illustration, 

00:47:44.562 --> 00:47:49.744
and they pick a winner for 
writing.  And I'm so proud that 

00:47:49.932 --> 00:47:54.709
this book got that last year, 
not this year, but last year.  

00:47:55.281 --> 00:47:59.107
So, thank you for asking 
SPEAKER:  And I remember when I 

00:47:59.108 --> 00:48:02.319
was 7 years old in Jamaica 
Queens and there was a little 

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:09.469
story front library right across
 from my school, P. S. 96 and I 

00:48:09.697 --> 00:48:18.036
ran in and a librarian gave me a
 book called "bright April".  I 

00:48:18.184 --> 00:48:22.936
loved that book so much.  I got 
library fines.  You know what

00:48:27.966 --> 00:48:31.811
 why I loved it?  There was a 
little girl who was 8 years old 

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:37.463
and looked just like me.  Brown 
pigtails and I looked in the 

00:48:37.674 --> 00:48:40.905
book and saw myself.  And I 
said, it must be pretty good if 

00:48:41.065 --> 00:48:45.658
I can see myself.  And it meant 
a lot to me to just have that.  

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:51.162
And I hugged that book and I 
hugged that book.  And I love 

00:48:51.321 --> 00:48:55.763
that book to this day.  I see 
myself in something that I love.

00:48:56.879 --> 00:49:01.045
SPEAKER:  I love that you are 
from Jamaica Queens.  I went to 

00:49:01.046 --> 00:49:06.738
P. S. 22. 
SPEAKER:  I went to P. S. 96.  

00:49:07.109 --> 00:49:09.466
In New York, means public 
school.  That means so much to 

00:49:10.515 --> 00:49:13.217
me.  I was already looking at 
books to find out about other 

00:49:13.503 --> 00:49:17.567
people and I loved books and I 
loved reading but I never saw 

00:49:17.870 --> 00:49:20.860
myself in a book.  It means a 
lot.  Any other questions?  

00:49:20.861 --> 00:49:25.628
SPEAKER:  The next question is 
going to be the last question. 

00:49:27.676 --> 00:49:31.316
SPEAKER:  Okay.  Two questions 
-- okay, three last questions. 

00:49:31.617 --> 00:49:39.334
SPEAKER:  Three super fast last 
questions.  questions.   

00:49:27.700 --> 00:49:29.700
questions.  
SPEAKER: 

00:49:33.943 --> 00:49:35.943
 Here is the first one right 
right here. 

00:49:39.794 --> 00:49:43.571
little, did you have to read and
 write a lot?  

00:49:43.572 --> 00:49:49.631
SPEAKER:  Yes.  To become an 
author, yes.  You really can be 

00:49:49.632 --> 00:49:52.299
anything.  It pays to read and 
write a lot.  And it's also 

00:49:52.557 --> 00:49:53.751
super fun.  So you you really 
you really don't

00:49:53.752 --> 00:49:58.220
 mind doing it.  But yes, you 
have to be a good reader.  

00:49:58.221 --> 00:50:05.109
SPEAKER:  And then we have 
another person -- a teenager.  

00:50:05.248 --> 00:50:07.248
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  All 

00:50:09.746 --> 00:50:14.883
right, so like I'm an artist.  
Yeah, and I consider writing to 

00:50:14.884 --> 00:50:20.474
be like an art.  So when I'm 
doing my thing, I make music and

00:50:20.606 --> 00:50:24.436
 paint and stuff.  So when I'm 
doing my stuff, I feel like it 

00:50:24.437 --> 00:50:26.437
comes best when I'm a 

00:50:29.338 --> 00:50:36.012
vessel and it pours out of me 
and it's spontaneous. 

00:50:36.013 --> 00:50:38.167
What is your method?  
SPEAKER:  I love that you have 

00:50:38.628 --> 00:50:42.272
all kinds of art at your 
disposal.  As an artist, there 

00:50:42.503 --> 00:50:47.734
is a whole time period where 
it's just coming out of you.  

00:50:47.844 --> 00:50:50.778
For me, it's where it will be a 
sentence that I write down 

00:50:51.139 --> 00:50:53.660
somewhere or a photograph that I
 see somewhere and I cut out and

00:50:53.661 --> 00:51:03.430
 I hold onto.  When I wrote the 
book "Ayesha Wants a Car" for

00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.780
 a long time, the sentence kept 
coming up tocoming up to 

00:51:09.275 --> 00:51:14.942
me.  Wants a car.  
Wants a car.  Did buy the first 

00:51:15.084 --> 00:51:17.308
family car.  And for some 
reason, the sentence kept 

00:51:17.978 --> 00:51:20.474
jamming in my head.  You 
probably have the same thing, a 

00:51:20.651 --> 00:51:23.257
phrase that you can't get rid of
 it then it becomes something.  

00:51:23.441 --> 00:51:26.277
The important thing is that you 
follow it.  

00:51:26.278 --> 00:51:28.795
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  Right.  
SPEAKER:  Just follow it.  But 

00:51:29.614 --> 00:51:33.522
thank you so much for your 
question.   

00:51:28.306 --> 00:51:30.306
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  It's 
AUDIENCE MEMBER:  It's great to 

00:51:31.902 --> 00:51:35.701
be here.  
SPEAKER:  Isn't this cool to 

00:51:36.022 --> 00:51:39.095
have create and write and all of
 that?  And we're going to have 

00:51:39.523 --> 00:51:45.122
more and more of this on 
Saturdays.  Let's give a hand 

00:51:45.498 --> 00:51:48.905
for Saturdays.  [Applause].  
Saturdays are good days.  And 

00:51:49.378 --> 00:51:52.191
it's a time when you can do 
things.  So we're going to 

00:51:52.648 --> 00:51:55.797
actually do something really 
fun.  We have one more question 

00:51:55.953 --> 00:52:02.451
from our friends and we're going
 to answer it before we go.  

00:52:02.722 --> 00:52:05.717
Because we have a special ribbon
 cutting.  We're going to cut 

00:52:05.718 --> 00:52:12.243
the ribbon to this room to say, 
it's open on Saturdays.  Come 

00:52:12.244 --> 00:52:15.535
and everything.  We have 
visitors that are this big.  We 

00:52:15.536 --> 00:52:18.761
have two teenagers from our 
advisory board.  We also want 

00:52:18.762 --> 00:52:22.109
you to know that we want you to 
come back and tell us, what 

00:52:22.110 --> 00:52:26.575
other things would you like to 
see in this childrens' center 

00:52:26.576 --> 00:52:29.476
and youth center.  We're going 
to be getting a lot of ideas 

00:52:29.477 --> 00:52:34.776
from people.  We hope that we 
can have more authors like Ms. 

00:52:36.516 --> 00:52:39.958
Medina to talk to you wherever 
you are on a regular basis.  

00:52:40.645 --> 00:52:45.309
That would be good.  We have one
 more question from?  

00:52:45.310 --> 00:52:50.634
SPEAKER:  Princeton. 
SPEAKER:  Princeton, New Jersey.

00:52:51.278 --> 00:52:54.989
SPEAKER:  9 years old.  What is 
your next book?  

00:52:54.990 --> 00:52:59.421
SPEAKER:  The next book, the 
main character lives in Florida 

00:53:00.188 --> 00:53:03.635
which her mother and father and 
grandmother and grandfather and 

00:53:04.117 --> 00:53:09.950
tia and two really pesky twins, 
Leo and Tomas and everybody is 

00:53:10.792 --> 00:53:17.131
just in her affairs.  And she is
 12.  And she is going to a new 

00:53:17.527 --> 00:53:20.344
school.  And at the same time 
she is noticing some things 

00:53:21.986 --> 00:53:27.209
changing with her friends, 
changing with her grandfather, 

00:53:27.399 --> 00:53:33.097
changing with herself.  That's 
as much as I got.  [Laughter].  

00:53:33.232 --> 00:53:34.948
Stay tuned. 
SPEAKER:  Stay tuned.  Thank you

00:53:34.949 --> 00:53:39.621
 Ms. Medina, we just can't thank
 you enough.  [Applause].  We're

00:53:40.395 --> 00:53:42.395
 going to cut the ribbon. 

00:53:46.331 --> 00:53:50.192
 And we are going to look -- I 
would like to have our two 

00:53:50.193 --> 00:53:52.548
helpers come up.  We have -- I 
mentioned we have an advisory 

00:53:52.549 --> 00:53:56.914
board here. 
And all of you are going to be 

00:53:57.100 --> 00:53:57.837
helping helping us. 

00:53:57.838 --> 00:54:01.791
 From the Richard Wright Public 
Charter School here in 

00:54:01.792 --> 00:54:07.940
Washington.  An 11th grader, 
Veronica 

00:54:11.483 --> 00:54:18.016
Payne and Edward Tolson.  
Everywhere you are, we're going 

00:54:18.017 --> 00:54:21.633
to need some help.  So who wants
 to help hold the ribbon?  Come 

00:54:21.758 --> 00:54:23.758
on. 

00:54:27.158 --> 00:54:30.784
 Hold the ribbon.  Okay.  We 
have got all of the cameras and 

00:54:30.785 --> 00:54:33.906
we're going to do this.  And 
then we're going to count down. 

00:54:34.430 --> 00:54:38.548
 Where are the big scissors?  
Have you ever seen scissors this

00:54:38.689 --> 00:54:43.068
 big?  Wow.  
These are big scissors.  Now we 

00:54:43.315 --> 00:54:48.117
got to be careful though.  You 
got to be careful anyway.  So 

00:54:48.258 --> 00:54:53.147
when you have super big 
scissors, okay, so we're going 

00:54:53.762 --> 00:55:00.119
to have someone help us.  You 
going to help?  Okay.  Now watch

00:55:01.331 --> 00:55:08.273

Count down everybody.  

00:55:08.274 --> 00:55:14.524
SPEAKER:  5, 4, 3, 2, 1.  Go.  
[Applause]. 

00:55:25.124 --> 00:55:27.124
11th graders are

00:55:29.399 --> 00:55:34.267
 going to say something.  You 
guys were really good at this 

00:55:34.268 --> 00:55:35.965
ribbon cutting. 
SPEAKER:  It's the scissors. 

00:55:35.966 --> 00:55:42.875
SPEAKER:  The scissors were 
good.  Who is going to speak 

00:55:43.025 --> 00:55:49.103
first?  Veronica is going to 
speak.  

00:55:49.104 --> 00:55:53.536
SPEAKER:  Good morning, 
everyone.  How are ya'll today? 

00:55:54.220 --> 00:56:00.047
Okay.  Well, my name is 
Veronica, I attend Richard 

00:56:00.933 --> 00:56:06.167
Wright Charter School and I'm 
part of the team building 

00:56:06.332 --> 00:56:10.289
program here at the Library of 
Congress.  [Applause].  First I 

00:56:10.667 --> 00:56:16.085
want to start off with how great
 I think this program is.  Ms. 

00:56:16.394 --> 00:56:19.628
Kathy and the other staff work 
really hard to make sure that we

00:56:19.629 --> 00:56:23.985
 are comfortable and engaged in 
the discussions we have at each 

00:56:24.784 --> 00:56:26.049
meeting.  If I wasn't already a 
book lover, I would spend the 

00:56:26.050 --> 00:56:28.050
the  the day

00:56:29.373 --> 00:56:33.955
 with Ms. Kathy because her love
 for books is inspiring.  

00:56:33.956 --> 00:56:37.872
Because of this program, I learn
 of new authors, read some 

00:56:37.873 --> 00:56:42.385
pretty amazing books and enjoy 
some good snacks.  I never left 

00:56:42.386 --> 00:56:46.069
our meetings without learning 
new things, whether it be about 

00:56:46.201 --> 00:56:51.722
books or other students in the 
program.  That's what I like 

00:56:52.374 --> 00:56:57.058
about the teen board program.  I
 am surrounded by people who may

00:56:57.304 --> 00:57:00.949
 not be familiar but enjoy books
 just as much as I do.  This 

00:57:01.299 --> 00:57:05.922
program is a place where young 
people can freely express 

00:57:05.923 --> 00:57:09.648
themselves, reading, writing and
 talking about books without 

00:57:09.876 --> 00:57:17.797
judgment.  That's why I'm 
thankful for the Teen Board 

00:57:19.679 --> 00:57:24.487
program and thankful for the 
experience and experience and 

00:57:18.804 --> 00:57:20.804
everything experience and 
everything that I

00:57:22.135 --> 00:57:25.943
 have learned from it.  
[Applause]. 

00:57:25.944 --> 00:57:30.691
SPEAKER:  Good morning everyone.
My name is Edward 

00:57:33.951 --> 00:57:40.687
Tolson.  I'm 15 years old.  The 
Teen Board is where I can 

00:57:40.688 --> 00:57:45.850
express myself through 
literature.  I have been a part 

00:57:45.851 --> 00:57:50.812
of the young Leaders Center that
 keeps getting better with the 

00:57:50.813 --> 00:57:53.434
books that are available.  My 
first question when I joined the

00:57:53.711 --> 00:57:59.168
 program was, was it going to be
 the average book club?  In the 

00:57:59.169 --> 00:58:01.521
Library of Congress, lots of old
 books are housed.  However, 

00:58:01.522 --> 00:58:07.504
that was not the case.  The 
young Readers Center is multi 

00:58:07.698 --> 00:58:11.353
dimensional.  We are exposed to 
new books every month and the 

00:58:11.354 --> 00:58:15.552
authors meet us and tell us how 
they started writing and we have

00:58:15.857 --> 00:58:21.356
 great snacks and wonderful 
books from various genres for 

00:58:21.357 --> 00:58:27.413
our reading pleasure.
I enjoy our monthly meetings 

00:58:27.715 --> 00:58:30.221
where we discuss our books and 
hear what other students read 

00:58:30.808 --> 00:58:33.443
and enjoying the environment and
 culture of the Young Leaders 

00:58:34.892 --> 00:58:40.621
Center.  It's a great program 
for young teenagers everywhere 

00:58:41.082 --> 00:58:44.635
for their minds and expanding 
their lives through reading.  

00:58:47.230 --> 00:58:49.060
[Applause].  
SPEAKER:  Now there is a reason 

00:58:49.061 --> 00:58:52.966
why we wanted you to hear about 
the teen advisory board and how 

00:58:53.473 --> 00:58:58.941
much fun that is.  The snacks, 
you will be getting some snacks 

00:58:59.156 --> 00:59:04.004
yourself.  And we think -- what 
do you think?  How about a kid 

00:59:04.183 --> 00:59:11.291
board?  Right.  The teens that 
have all the fun, we think the 

00:59:11.712 --> 00:59:15.042
kids should have some too.  So 
we want you to think about being

00:59:15.177 --> 00:59:20.018
 a part on the new kid board.  
Give yourself a hand.  I think 

00:59:20.177 --> 00:59:24.299
you all have good questions.  
And to celebrate that and 

00:59:24.449 --> 00:59:28.515
celebrate Ms. Medina being here 
and all of the good stuff.  

00:59:28.516 --> 00:59:31.032
We're really going to renovate 
and fix this stuff up.  We're 

00:59:31.538 --> 00:59:37.362
going to throw stuff around and 
make a mess.  [Applause].  Yeah,

00:59:37.535 --> 00:59:41.001
 we're just going to make a mess
 and have a good time.  Can 

00:59:41.160 --> 00:59:44.548
somebody tell us how we're going
 to do this?  We're just going 

00:59:44.549 --> 00:59:49.337
to -- you're going to show us?  
We're going to count down again 

00:59:50.135 --> 00:59:54.713
and thank you to all of our 
friends, in New Jersey, in New 

00:59:55.328 --> 00:59:59.965
York, on Amsterdam Avenue, 
Florida.  One more, South 

01:00:00.309 --> 01:00:02.270
Carolina.  Let's say goodbye to 
to  to everybody. 

01:00:05.632 --> 01:00:07.942
Whoa.  Thank you.  
We will see you soon and come 

01:00:08.168 --> 01:00:14.918
help us make a mess.  Come on.  
1, 2, 3.  Yay.  [Cheers and

01:00:18.222 --> 01:00:22.821
 applause].  Thank you.  Now, 
let's give some treats.
