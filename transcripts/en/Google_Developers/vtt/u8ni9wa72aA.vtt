SUZ HINTON: I'm Suz Hinton.

00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.060
I bring novelty
to existing ideas.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.790
And this is how I code.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.400
Right now I'm working on
a plant automation device

00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.770
just because I'm going on a
long vacation really soon,

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:12.030
and I care about my plants.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:14.415
And instead of the plants
just using the internet

00:00:14.415 --> 00:00:16.290
to communicate with each
other, they actually

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:18.780
use an audio data
protocol called Chirp.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.680
I'm laying out
like a custom PCV.

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.920
And it's going to be a
shield for a Raspberry Pi.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:24.990
At the moment I've
done the schematic.

00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:27.480
Now I just have to lay out all
the components on the board.

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.120
Try to implement
someone else's work.

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.390
The biggest growth
that I saw as a coder

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:39.218
was actually implementing
something from a spec.

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:41.010
One of my favorite
papers that I'm actually

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.010
trying to implement right
now is called Push Pull + +.

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.930
It's by Lipp, Wonka, and Muller.

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.780
And it's all about
trying to figure out

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.940
if you have a certain
amount of vertices,

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.760
how do you then grab one
face and extend it out

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:54.630
intelligently?

00:00:54.630 --> 00:00:56.960
And what is the
math around that?

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:57.640
I'm Suz Hinton.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:00:59.640
If you want to reach out
to me, you can actually

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:00.630
hit me up on Twitter.

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:04.280
