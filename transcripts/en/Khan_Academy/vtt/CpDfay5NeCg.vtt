00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.280
A function f of x
is plotted below.

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:05.560
Highlight an interval
where f prime

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:08.480
of x with the first derivative
of f with respect to x

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.250
is greater than 0.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:13.390
So if our derivative, f prime
of x, is greater than 0,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:16.230
that means that the slope of
the tangent line is positive.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.660
That means that
the function must

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.610
be increasing
whenever this is true.

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.320
So where is the
function increasing?

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.760
So over here we see
that as x increases,

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:28.450
our function is going to
smaller and smaller values.

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:31.580
So our function is
decreasing this entire place.

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:34.670
Then it's decreasing at
slower and slower rates

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.370
all the way to the
point right over here

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:39.919
where the slope of the
tangent line is flat.

00:00:39.919 --> 00:00:41.585
And then the function
starts increasing.

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:44.200
And it starts increasing at
faster and faster and faster

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:44.980
rates.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:48.417
So we could put this blue
area anywhere from here

00:00:48.417 --> 00:00:50.500
to anywhere in this region
here where the function

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:51.680
itself is increasing.

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.870
Notice, the function
could even be negative,

00:00:53.870 --> 00:00:55.190
but the function is increasing.

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:56.884
So even this would
be a valid place.

00:00:56.884 --> 00:00:58.050
That would be a valid place.

00:00:58.050 --> 00:01:01.960
Anywhere where the function's
rate of-- when x increases,

00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:04.280
the function is
actually getting larger.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:05.560
So let's check our answer.

00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:08.390
And let's do a
couple more of these.

00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:10.410
A function f of x
is plotted below.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.260
Highlight an interval where
f of x is greater than 0.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.304
So f of x should be sitting in
the first or second quadrant

00:01:16.304 --> 00:01:16.970
right over here.

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.410
It needs to be greater
than 0, and f prime

00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:21.550
of x is less than 0.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:24.140
So f prime of x
less than 0 means

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:26.270
that the function is decreasing.

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.290
The slope of the tangent
line is negative.

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:29.290
So let's think about it.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:32.010
The two areas where f
of x is greater than 0

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:34.820
are this interval
right over here

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:37.840
and this interval
right over here.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.990
But we also care about
the function decreasing.

00:01:40.990 --> 00:01:43.780
This won't be valid, because
the function is increasing here.

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.571
It's increasing at
slower and slower rates,

00:01:45.571 --> 00:01:46.480
but it is increasing.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.420
The function is going
up as x goes up.

00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:54.810
If we go over here, the function
is decreasing as x increases.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:56.750
So this seems to
meet our constraints.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:59.660
This area right over here
won't because the function

00:01:59.660 --> 00:02:01.680
is positive, but
it's also increasing.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:04.000
So here the derivative
is positive.

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.990
Here the derivative is positive.

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:08.199
Here the derivative is negative.

00:02:08.199 --> 00:02:10.180
So the function
itself is positive,

00:02:10.180 --> 00:02:13.070
but the slope of the
tangent line is negative.

00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:16.820
It's decreasing as x increases.

00:02:16.820 --> 00:02:19.600
Let's do one more.

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:21.050
The function f is plotted below.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:23.600
Highlight an interval where
f of x is greater than 0

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:24.970
and f prime of x is less than 0.

00:02:24.970 --> 00:02:27.820
So the same exact idea--
where are we positive

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.910
but our function is
actually decreasing?

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.320
So it's positive here,
but we can't pick that.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:34.660
It's positive here,
but we can't pick that.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:38.210
The function is decreasing here,
but the function isn't positive

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:38.710
there.

00:02:38.710 --> 00:02:41.210
The derivative is negative, but
the function isn't positive.

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:43.630
So that wouldn't make it.

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:48.240
So this is the only region
that we can throw it in.

00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:50.640
And we got it right again.
