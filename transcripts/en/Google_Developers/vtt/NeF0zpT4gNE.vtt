SUNDAR PICHAI:
Welcome to Google I/O.

00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.500
For someone like me, who
grew up without a phone,

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.340
I can distinctly remember how
gaining access to technology

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.290
can make a difference
in your lives.

00:00:15.290 --> 00:00:17.560
That's why we've been
so focused on bringing

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:21.070
digital skills to
communities around the world.

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:23.980
We've trained over
25 million people,

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:27.160
and we expect that number
to rise over 60 million

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.500
in the next five years.

00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:32.250
Health care is one of
the most important fields

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.010
AI is going to transform.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:37.060
We announced our work
on diabetic retinopathy

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.090
and we used deep learning
to help doctors diagnose it.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:42.760
We can predict
the five year risk

00:00:42.760 --> 00:00:45.970
of you having an adverse
cardiovascular event, heart

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:47.910
attack or strokes.

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:50.050
We have been working
with our partners

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:53.210
using de-identified
medical records.

00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:56.050
Turns out, if you go and
analyze over 100,000 data

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.110
points per patient, more
than any single doctor could

00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:03.520
analyze, we can actually
quantitatively predict

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:07.720
the chance of readmission
24 to 48 hours earlier

00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.950
than traditional methods.

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:11.890
It gives doctors
more time to act.

00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:16.840
We are bringing another feature
to G-mail: smart compose.

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:22.360
We use machine learning to
start suggesting phrases for you

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:24.040
as you type.

00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:28.450
All you need to do is to hit
Tab and keep order completing.

00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:31.690
Another product
is Google Photos.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:33.350
We are bringing a new feature.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.200
If you took a picture
of a document which

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:37.780
you want to save
for later, we can

00:01:37.780 --> 00:01:41.680
recognize, convert
the document to PDF

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.520
and make it much easier
for you to use later.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:47.860
Or if you happen to have a
very special memory, something

00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:51.970
in black and white, we can
recreate that moment in color

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:56.240
and make that moment even
more real and special.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:00.380
And we are adding, as
of today, six new voices

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:01.520
to the Google Assistant.

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:04.310
John Legend's voice will
be coming later this year

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.873
so that you can get
responses like this.

00:02:06.873 --> 00:02:08.539
JOHN LEGENDS: At 10
AM you have an event

00:02:08.539 --> 00:02:10.610
called Google I/O keynote.

00:02:10.610 --> 00:02:13.340
Then at 1:00 PM you
have margaritas.

00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:15.380
Have a wonderful day.

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.330
SUNDAR PICHAI: I'm looking
forward to 1:00 PM.

00:02:17.330 --> 00:02:18.860
SPEAKER 2: Today
the Assistant is

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.730
available on over
500 million devices.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:24.710
Now by the end of this
year the Assistant

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:29.265
will support 30 languages and
be available in 80 countries.

00:02:29.265 --> 00:02:30.890
But one step that
we've been working on

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:32.532
is something we
call Pretty Please.

00:02:32.532 --> 00:02:33.490
SPEAKER 3: Hey, Google.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:34.670
Talk to [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:37.446
SPEAKER 4: Daddy, you
forgot to say please.

00:02:37.446 --> 00:02:39.740
SPEAKER 5: Tell me
a story, please.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.540
ASSISTANT: Thanks
for asking so nicely.

00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:42.804
You're very polite.

00:02:42.804 --> 00:02:45.530
SPEAKER 6: I know.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:48.290
SPEAKER 2: So the Assistant
understands and responds

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:51.147
to positive conversation
with polite reinforcement.

00:02:51.147 --> 00:02:52.730
SPEAKER 7: Now
sometimes the Assistant

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:56.390
can actually be more helpful by
having a lower visual profile.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.250
So let's say I'm
heading home from work,

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:00.050
I have Google Maps
showing me the fastest

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:02.130
route during rush hour traffic.

00:03:02.130 --> 00:03:02.630
Hey, Google.

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:05.797
Send Nick my ETA and
play some hip hop.

00:03:05.797 --> 00:03:06.380
ASSISTANT: OK.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:08.120
Letting Nick know
you're 20 minutes away,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.615
and check out this hip hop
music station on YouTube.

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:11.990
SUNDAR PICHAI:
Let's say you want

00:03:11.990 --> 00:03:15.860
to ask Google to make
your haircut appointment.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:19.220
So what you're going to
hear is the Google Assistant

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:21.950
actually calling a
real salon to schedule

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:23.414
an appointment for you.

00:03:23.414 --> 00:03:25.070
[RINGING]

00:03:38.395 --> 00:03:40.930
That was a real
call you just heard.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:42.520
The amazing thing
is the Assistant

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:46.120
can actually understand the
nuances of conversation.

00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:50.150
We've been working on this
technology for many years.

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:52.180
It's called Google Duplex.

00:03:52.180 --> 00:03:54.340
It brings together
all our investments

00:03:54.340 --> 00:03:57.160
over the years in natural
language understanding,

00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:59.920
deep learning, text to speech.

00:03:59.920 --> 00:04:02.521
I'm really excited to
announce the new Google News.

00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:04.270
TRYSTAN UPSTILL: With
the new Google News,

00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:07.040
we set out to help
you do three things.

00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.790
First, keep up with the
news you care about.

00:04:09.790 --> 00:04:12.710
Second, understand
the full story.

00:04:12.710 --> 00:04:16.649
And finally, enjoy and
support the sources you love.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:20.620
Our AI constantly reads the
fire hose of the web for you.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:24.760
The millions of articles,
videos, podcasts and comments

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:27.880
being published every minute,
and assembles the key things

00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:29.560
you need to know.

00:04:29.560 --> 00:04:31.990
We're also excited to
introduce a new visual format

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:33.820
we call Newscasts.

00:04:33.820 --> 00:04:36.970
You're not going to see
these in any other news app.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:39.430
Newscast give me an easy
way to get the basics

00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:42.850
and decide where I want
to dive in more deeply.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:46.180
Full Coverage is an
invitation to learn more.

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:48.370
It gives a complete
picture of a story

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:49.870
in terms of how
it's being reported

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:53.890
from a variety of sources
and a variety of formats.

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.840
This is by far the most
powerful feature of the app.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:58.270
And here in the
Newstand section,

00:04:58.270 --> 00:05:01.980
it's easy to find and follow
the sources I already love

00:05:01.980 --> 00:05:04.210
and browse and
discover new ones.

00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.910
And if there's a publication
I want to subscribe to,

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:08.957
we make it dead simple.

00:05:08.957 --> 00:05:11.040
Because you're signed in
with your Google account,

00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:12.520
you're set.

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.490
We're rolling out on
Android, iOS and the web

00:05:15.490 --> 00:05:18.850
in 127 countries starting today.

00:05:18.850 --> 00:05:20.980
SPEAKER 8: Growth of Android
over the last 10 years

00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:23.500
has helped fuel the
shift in computing

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:26.085
from desktop to mobile.

00:05:26.085 --> 00:05:29.470
[INAUDIBLE] mention, AI is
going to profoundly change

00:05:29.470 --> 00:05:30.179
industries.

00:05:30.179 --> 00:05:31.720
And this brings me
to the new version

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:33.820
of Android we're working on.

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.250
Android P.

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:37.600
Adaptive battery uses
on-device machine

00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.640
learning to figure
out which apps

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.250
you'll use in the next few
hours and which you won't use

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:44.890
until later, if at all today.

00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:47.950
With Android P, we're going
to beyond simply predicting

00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:51.310
the next app to launch to
predicting the next action you

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.480
want to take.

00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:54.760
We call this
feature App Actions.

00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:57.610
What's happening here is that
the actions are being predicted

00:05:57.610 --> 00:05:59.960
based on my usage patterns.

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:01.870
The phone is adapting
to me and trying

00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:05.350
to help me get to my
next task more quickly.

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:08.020
Slices are a new
API for developers

00:06:08.020 --> 00:06:11.090
to define interactive
snippets of their app UI.

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.680
That can be surfaced in
different places in the OS.

00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:18.000
With ML Kit, you
get on-device APIs

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:21.250
to text recognition, face
detection, image labeling

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.020
and a lot more.

00:06:23.020 --> 00:06:25.720
And ML Kit also
supports the ability

00:06:25.720 --> 00:06:29.410
to tap into Google's cloud
based ML technologies.

00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.410
SPEAKER 9: Our team has heard
so many stories from people

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.770
who are trying to find the
right balance with technology.

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.750
One of the first
things we focused on

00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:40.840
was helping you
understand your habits.

00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:43.330
Android P will show you
a dashboard of how you're

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:45.430
spending time on your device.

00:06:45.430 --> 00:06:47.860
As you saw earlier, you
can see how much time you

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.810
spent in apps, how
many times you've

00:06:49.810 --> 00:06:52.900
unlocked your device today and
how many notifications you've

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:53.920
received.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.220
Android P lets you set
time limits on apps

00:06:57.220 --> 00:06:59.600
and will nudge you when
you're close to your limit

00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:01.780
that it's time to
do something else.

00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:03.760
If you turn your phone
over on the table,

00:07:03.760 --> 00:07:06.640
it automatically enters
do not disturb so you

00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:08.850
can focus on being present.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:12.316
No pings, vibrations,
or other distractions.

00:07:12.316 --> 00:07:13.690
You can tell the
Google Assistant

00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:15.490
what time you aim to go to bed.

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:17.350
And when that time
arrives it will switch on

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.720
do not disturb and
fade the screen

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:23.230
to grayscale, which is far
less stimulating for the brain

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:25.660
and can help you
set the phone down.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:31.310
Well, today we're
announcing Android P Beta.

00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:33.910
SPEAKER 10: Maps was
built to assist everyone.

00:07:33.910 --> 00:07:36.880
We've mapped over 220
countries and territories

00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.430
and put hundreds of millions
of businesses and places

00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:40.690
on the map.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:44.074
We're adding a new tab
to maps called For You.

00:07:44.074 --> 00:07:45.490
It's designed to
tell you what you

00:07:45.490 --> 00:07:48.250
need to know about the
neighborhoods you care about.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.160
New places that are
opening, what's trending now

00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.530
and personal recommendations.

00:07:53.530 --> 00:07:56.320
We've created a score
called Your Match

00:07:56.320 --> 00:07:59.770
to help you find more
places that you'll love.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:03.250
Your Match uses machine learning
to combine what Google knows

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.520
about hundreds and millions
of places with the information

00:08:06.520 --> 00:08:07.927
that I've added.

00:08:07.927 --> 00:08:09.760
SPEAKER 11: Let me paint
a familiar picture.

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.000
Your phone says, head
south on Market Street.

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.859
One problem: you have no
idea which way is south.

00:08:15.859 --> 00:08:17.400
So you look down at
the phone, you're

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:19.230
looking at that
blue dot on the map,

00:08:19.230 --> 00:08:20.980
and you're starting
to walk to see if it's

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.120
moving in the same direction.

00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:24.980
Our team's have been
working really hard

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:28.130
to combine the power of the
camera, the computer vision,

00:08:28.130 --> 00:08:32.630
with Street View and Maps to
re-imagine walking navigation.

00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.539
So here's how it could
look like in Google Maps.

00:08:35.539 --> 00:08:37.190
Notice that you
also see the map,

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.030
so that way you stay oriented.

00:08:39.030 --> 00:08:41.210
You can start to
see nearby places,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.169
so you see what's around you.

00:08:43.169 --> 00:08:45.770
Now with smart
text selection you

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.800
can now connect the words
you see with the answers

00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.300
and actions you need.

00:08:50.300 --> 00:08:55.370
So you can do things like copy
and paste from the real world

00:08:55.370 --> 00:08:57.347
directly into your phone.

00:08:57.347 --> 00:08:59.180
You're at your friend's
place, you check out

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.040
this trendy looking
lamp, and you

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.860
want to know things
that match that style.

00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.800
And now Lens can help you.

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:08.090
You open the camera
and you start

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:12.760
to see Lens surface proactively,
all the information instantly.

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:15.410
And it even anchors that
information to the things

00:09:15.410 --> 00:09:16.629
that you see.

00:09:16.629 --> 00:09:18.170
SPEAKER 12: Waymo
is the only company

00:09:18.170 --> 00:09:23.000
in the world with a fleet
of fully self-driving cars,

00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.210
with no one in the driver's
seat, on public roads.

00:09:26.210 --> 00:09:28.700
So Phoenix will
be the first stop

00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.280
for Waymo's driverless
transportation service, which

00:09:31.280 --> 00:09:33.190
is launching later this year.

00:09:33.190 --> 00:09:37.640
Soon everyone will be able
to call Waymo using our app

00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:39.680
and a fully
self-driving car will

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:42.530
pull up, with no one
in the driver's seat,

00:09:42.530 --> 00:09:44.197
to whisk them away
to their destination.

00:09:44.197 --> 00:09:46.363
SPEAKER 10: And I hope you
all find some inspiration

00:09:46.363 --> 00:09:48.350
in the next few days
to keep building

00:09:48.350 --> 00:09:50.560
good things for everyone.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.380
Thank you.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:53.200
SUNDAR PICHAI: This
came to my attention.

00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.550
We restored the natural laws
of physics, so all is well.

00:09:58.550 --> 00:10:00.850
We can get back to business.
