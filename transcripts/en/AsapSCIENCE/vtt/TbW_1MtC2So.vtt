00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:07.529
This, is the story of how your safety and future finances were robbed without you ever really noticing. Back in the 70s,

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:09.400
Everyone was like (peace),

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.660
but there was also the creation of an energy company called Exxon. They were obsessed with what we are still obsessed with now;

00:00:16.209 --> 00:00:23.999
innovation. So, the oil company Exxon, decided to invest in science. Scientists hired by Exxon, again Exxon's very own

00:00:24.519 --> 00:00:29.819
scientists, were the first to present a series of groundbreaking papers explaining that burning fossil fuels will

00:00:30.130 --> 00:00:34.020
influence the climate as the carbon dioxide released will cause a greenhouse effect

00:00:34.329 --> 00:00:40.289
Isn't it ironic, don't you think, that oil companies discovered climate change. This happened right in the early

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.719
1980s just as the price of oil was

00:00:42.790 --> 00:00:50.579
decreasing, so the higher-ups at Exxon chose to ignore the information and instead focus on growing the business. They did ask the scientists to keep

00:00:50.579 --> 00:00:51.910
looking into it.

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:59.189
In 1982, their own scientists again came back, this time with more thorough research saying "yep, it was worse than they thought."

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.489
Based on what Exxon was planning to do in regards to fossil fuel extraction

00:01:02.739 --> 00:01:09.539
would warm the climate, cause sea levels to rise, and increase deadly droughts. Humans will suffer effects, which will be indeed

00:01:09.939 --> 00:01:16.049
catastrophic so the scientists pitched a major reduction in fossil fuel combustion. An email from Lenny Bernstein, a

00:01:16.119 --> 00:01:18.299
former employee of Exxon wrote: "In the

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:23.519
1980's, Exxon needed to understand the potential for concerns about climate change to lead to

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:31.170
regulation of...potential projects. They were well ahead of the rest of the industry in this awareness." If Exxon wanted to be innovators so bad,

00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.100
maybe they would have taken this moment to

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:34.659
diversify the energy sector-

00:01:34.659 --> 00:01:41.699
invest in alternative energy sources, but instead they decided to lie. To you, to me, and to your mom. It is now the

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:49.619
1980s, and for the first time an internal memo is released at Exxon that says, they "need to start to emphasize the uncertainty of the

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.059
scientific data around climate change." They begin to start going against their very own

00:01:54.369 --> 00:02:01.169
science and plant the seed for what we now know as climate change denial. Here is part of an internal memo from Exxon at the

00:02:01.170 --> 00:02:03.170
time. "There is currently no unambiguous

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.729
scientific evidence that the earth is warming. If the earth is on a warming trend we're not likely to detect it before

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:12.839
1995." One of the most frustrating parts of this story is that Exxon

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.869
did believe their climate change science. Right at this time they started to build

00:02:17.150 --> 00:02:24.130
drilling platforms in the ocean a little bit higher up to deal with the rising sea levels they predicted. They also started to plan to

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:24.950
drill in the Arctic,

00:02:24.950 --> 00:02:31.030
because as they knew the sea ice in the Arctic was going to melt. In the late 80s, the effects of climate change began to

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:31.910
become apparent.

00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:37.419
Time magazine had a picture of the planet in shackles due to climate change on their cover, as the scientific

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:40.149
impact of burning fossil fuels became public knowledge.

00:02:40.490 --> 00:02:45.129
At the time, 80% of Americans claimed that climate change was an issue, and

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.859
accepted that it was caused by the burning of fossil fuels. It was also not a political issue. Here, is

00:02:50.959 --> 00:02:54.279
Republican President George Bush senior on the campaign trail in

00:02:54.770 --> 00:03:01.270
1988 after a year of severe heat waves killed thousands of Americans: "Don't say these problems are too big, that

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:09.639
it's impossible for an individual, or even a nation as great as ours to solve the problem of global warming,

00:03:10.370 --> 00:03:14.950
or the loss of forests, or the deterioration of our oceans.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:19.149
My response is simple; it can be done, and

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.410
we must do it.

00:03:21.410 --> 00:03:24.130
Let's not forget all that we've accomplished,

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.970
all that we've accomplished since America first

00:03:28.790 --> 00:03:30.790
concentrated its attention on

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:32.830
preserving the environment,

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.650
under a Republican administration,

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.509
back in 1970." This is the time when the oil companies started to get scared of that (evil

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:45.639
regulation from the government) so they started to really jack up their campaigns to increase

00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:52.540
climate change denial. They became inventive, they actually created the OP ad that we now sometimes see in newspapers, where it kind of looks like

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:57.279
an article but it's actually fully a paid advertisement. So this is one of the op ads that they paid for in the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:04:03.309
liberal New York Times. "One of the brighter hopes with the climate change debate has to be the benefits achieved

00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.169
through technology." Notice how they used the word "debate" and notice how they sort of make it seem like, oh

00:04:08.170 --> 00:04:12.489
climate change might be a good thing because we're gonna invent new things to cope. They secretly paid

00:04:12.799 --> 00:04:17.739
scientists to promote fake science. In an article called climate change: a degree of uncertainty,

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:21.190
the first line wrote: "The debate on climate change has been long,

00:04:21.620 --> 00:04:28.120
complex, and intense." This is of course not true, because according to their own science that there wasn't really a debate at all.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:34.209
Quite a short explanation that was really quite simple it's that, the burning of CO2 creates a greenhouse effect that warms the earth.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.960
In 1997 Lee Raymond, the CEO of Exxon at the time actually

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:38.990
decided that in the

00:04:38.990 --> 00:04:45.880
presentation he was going to say that, no in fact according to their science the earth was cooling. This was a full lie. Again he

00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:47.870
did this in a presentation in 1997,

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:55.720
more than 20 years after his own scientists first broke the fact that the greenhouse effect is real, and the name of his

00:04:55.910 --> 00:05:02.829
presentation, boldly a bold lie was, "Is the earth warming? Does burning fossil fuels cause global warming?"

00:05:03.169 --> 00:05:09.098
Lee Raymond sucks, because he also is the person who began to make climate change a political issue. Lee Raymond

00:05:09.169 --> 00:05:14.319
persuaded George Bush, the younger one, to go against his campaign promise and take carbon dioxide

00:05:14.539 --> 00:05:20.919
off the list of pollutants. These are one of the first times that we actually see climate change become a political issue, a side of

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:24.519
left or right, and at the time the Republican Party was under a lot of pressure

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:27.699
from these big oil companies, and they released this

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:35.470
Memo: "The scientific debate is closing [against us] but not yet closed. There is still a window of opportunity to challenge the science."

00:05:35.599 --> 00:05:42.099
Later in the memo it reads: "Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues around global warming are settled, their views about

00:05:42.199 --> 00:05:48.669
global warming will change accordingly. Therefore we need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a

00:05:48.949 --> 00:05:52.359
primary issue of debate". All of this hard work paid off. In

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:58.750
2017, around 90% of Americans did not know there was a scientific consensus on global warming.

00:05:59.479 --> 00:06:04.899
52% of Americans think the threat of climate change has been exaggerated. This lack of knowledge helped Rex Tillerson,

00:06:04.909 --> 00:06:05.409
who

00:06:05.409 --> 00:06:10.569
became the CEO of Exxon after it merged with Mobil to become Exxon Mobil, to sign a

00:06:10.970 --> 00:06:18.159
500 billion dollar deal to explore for oil in the rapidly thawing Russian Arctic. For this plan, he was awarded the

00:06:18.259 --> 00:06:25.839
Russian order of friendship. Global warming and climate change is caused by our immense burning of coal, gas, and oil for energy.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.939
This causes the carbon release to combine with oxygen in the atmosphere to produce CO2,

00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:36.219
carbon dioxide, which traps heat that would have been radiated back out into space.

00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:37.910
Due to this, the extra

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:44.029
heat trapped near earth is equivalent to the heat from four hundred thousand bombs the size of what was dropped on Hiroshima,

00:06:44.430 --> 00:06:47.870
being collected in our atmosphere every day. By

00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:50.989
2100, the rising sea levels will cost the world 14

00:06:51.150 --> 00:06:57.620
trillion dollars. 9 of the 10 deadliest heat waves in recorded human history have occurred since the year

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:05.810
2000. Since the 1970s, 60% of the world's wildlife has been killed. If we continue with our current greenhouse gas emissions, by

00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:14.270
2070 tropical regions that now get one day a year of oppressive humid heat will get between 100 to 250 days per year.

00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:19.520
100 million trees died in California in the past 10 years, and studies show that by

00:07:19.710 --> 00:07:25.850
2050, if temperatures rise the way they are predicted, a quarter of the earth will experience extreme droughts and desertification.

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:32.390
Stephen Hawking gave humanity a deadline of a century to leave earth, as it may be the only way to save ourselves.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.340
And who is going to be able to afford this? Maybe Lee Raymond, as his retirement package from

00:07:37.710 --> 00:07:45.000
ExxonMobil was a mere $400 000 000, for his impressive work of making money for the company at your expense.

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.790
Climate change is real. I was lied to,

00:07:47.790 --> 00:07:52.700
you were lied to, your parents were lied to. These oil companies did all of this because they were

00:07:52.770 --> 00:07:59.059
short-sighted. They wanted to make money for themselves, but we need to think about the future. We as young people are the ones who

00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:01.669
are left to kind of figure out this mess. It's not

00:08:01.890 --> 00:08:08.959
necessarily our fault, this is a huge injustice. All these lies and deceit that these companies did to the public consciousness are

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.119
unfair, but we have to figure out what we do now. In our next video we're gonna talk about hope.

00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:15.990
So, one thing is that a lot of people are

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:21.620
challenging and figuring out how the law should get involved with these companies. They should technically be sued for what they did.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:26.510
There's the green New Deal happening in America, What exactly is that what does that mean for such a large

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.479
economic power? And we're gonna highlight some of the amazing,

00:08:29.730 --> 00:08:34.219
innovative ways that science is now trying to figure out how to clean up this mess.

00:08:34.410 --> 00:08:39.799
Thank you so much for watching, you can subscribe to this channel we're gonna release the video in the next few weeks. We just

00:08:39.800 --> 00:08:45.229
wanted to make this video because we make our animated videos on Thursdays where we try and get people interested in science and

00:08:45.690 --> 00:08:49.280
understanding a critical thought and learning about how the world works around us, but there's

00:08:49.350 --> 00:08:54.509
Also these other things going on within the science community that we need to talk about and that's what this video was, so we hope

00:08:54.510 --> 00:09:01.080
that you like it. Follow me on Instagram and Twitter, smash out like button, hit that subscribe and we'll see you next week. Peace :)
