there's some things are just
 

00:16:10.010 --> 00:16:13.420 align:start position:0%
there's some things are just
straightforward<00:16:10.520><c> this</c><00:16:11.090><c> is</c><00:16:11.270><c> how</c><00:16:11.630><c> they</c><00:16:11.840><c> are</c><00:16:12.430><c> if</c>

00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:13.430 align:start position:0%
straightforward this is how they are if
 

00:16:13.430 --> 00:16:14.500 align:start position:0%
straightforward this is how they are if
you<00:16:13.580><c> don't</c><00:16:13.700><c> call</c><00:16:13.880><c> Walker</c><00:16:14.120><c> you</c><00:16:14.270><c> call</c><00:16:14.420><c> it</c>

00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:14.510 align:start position:0%
you don't call Walker you call it
 

00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:16.060 align:start position:0%
you don't call Walker you call it
something<00:16:14.750><c> else</c><00:16:14.810><c> this</c><00:16:15.080><c> is</c><00:16:15.110><c> still</c><00:16:15.500><c> how</c><00:16:15.680><c> it</c><00:16:15.860><c> is</c>

00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:16.070 align:start position:0%
something else this is still how it is
 

00:16:16.070 --> 00:16:19.000 align:start position:0%
something else this is still how it is
and<00:16:16.430><c> if</c><00:16:17.390><c> I</c><00:16:17.750><c> was</c><00:16:17.870><c> to</c><00:16:17.930><c> get</c><00:16:18.080><c> to</c><00:16:18.170><c> the</c><00:16:18.290><c> door</c><00:16:18.500><c> the</c><00:16:18.800><c> best</c>

00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:19.010 align:start position:0%
and if I was to get to the door the best
 

00:16:19.010 --> 00:16:20.650 align:start position:0%
and if I was to get to the door the best
way<00:16:19.130><c> to</c><00:16:19.160><c> do</c><00:16:19.370><c> it</c><00:16:19.520><c> seems</c><00:16:19.790><c> to</c><00:16:20.030><c> be</c><00:16:20.150><c> walking</c><00:16:20.390><c> you</c>

00:16:20.650 --> 00:16:20.660 align:start position:0%
way to do it seems to be walking you
 

00:16:20.660 --> 00:16:21.790 align:start position:0%
way to do it seems to be walking you
know<00:16:20.750><c> it's</c><00:16:20.870><c> like</c><00:16:20.990><c> there's</c><00:16:21.170><c> just</c><00:16:21.380><c> some</c><00:16:21.530><c> things</c>

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:21.800 align:start position:0%
know it's like there's just some things
 

00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:24.280 align:start position:0%
know it's like there's just some things
that<00:16:22.070><c> are</c><00:16:22.220><c> kind</c><00:16:22.880><c> of</c><00:16:22.970><c> nosey</c><00:16:23.690><c> like</c><00:16:23.840><c> cartwheels</c>

00:16:24.280 --> 00:16:24.290 align:start position:0%
that are kind of nosey like cartwheels
 

00:16:24.290 --> 00:16:28.080 align:start position:0%
that are kind of nosey like cartwheels
or<00:16:24.470><c> flips</c><00:16:24.770><c> that</c><00:16:25.430><c> would</c><00:16:25.580><c> be</c><00:16:25.700><c> on</c><00:16:25.880><c> us</c><00:16:26.120><c> but</c><00:16:26.690><c> still</c>

00:16:28.080 --> 00:16:28.090 align:start position:0%
or flips that would be on us but still
 

00:16:28.090 --> 00:16:31.900 align:start position:0%
or flips that would be on us but still
but<00:16:29.090><c> I</c><00:16:29.150><c> can't</c><00:16:29.480><c> do</c><00:16:29.600><c> that</c><00:16:29.750><c> yet</c><00:16:29.960><c> so</c><00:16:30.190><c> my</c><00:16:31.190><c> option</c><00:16:31.700><c> is</c>

00:16:31.900 --> 00:16:31.910 align:start position:0%
but I can't do that yet so my option is
 

00:16:31.910 --> 00:16:34.720 align:start position:0%
but I can't do that yet so my option is
walking<00:16:32.650><c> that</c><00:16:33.650><c> seems</c><00:16:33.950><c> to</c><00:16:34.070><c> be</c><00:16:34.160><c> the</c><00:16:34.280><c> best</c><00:16:34.490><c> option</c>

00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:34.730 align:start position:0%
walking that seems to be the best option
 

00:16:34.730 --> 00:16:36.880 align:start position:0%
walking that seems to be the best option
so<00:16:34.970><c> I</c><00:16:35.300><c> will</c><00:16:35.510><c> do</c><00:16:35.660><c> that</c><00:16:35.930><c> maybe</c><00:16:36.410><c> one</c><00:16:36.650><c> day</c><00:16:36.680><c> I'll</c>

00:16:36.880 --> 00:16:36.890 align:start position:0%
so I will do that maybe one day I'll
 

00:16:36.890 --> 00:16:39.040 align:start position:0%
so I will do that maybe one day I'll
learn<00:16:37.010><c> how</c><00:16:37.160><c> to</c><00:16:37.190><c> do</c><00:16:37.340><c> cart</c><00:16:37.640><c> wheels</c><00:16:38.300><c> and</c><00:16:38.630><c> stuff</c><00:16:38.780><c> to</c>

00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.050 align:start position:0%
learn how to do cart wheels and stuff to
 

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.900 align:start position:0%
learn how to do cart wheels and stuff to
the<00:16:39.230><c> door</c><00:16:39.440><c> but</c><00:16:40.010><c> I</c><00:16:40.040><c> don't</c><00:16:40.400><c> know</c><00:16:40.490><c> that</c><00:16:40.700><c> yet</c><00:16:40.880><c> so</c>

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:40.910 align:start position:0%
the door but I don't know that yet so
 

00:16:40.910 --> 00:16:42.580 align:start position:0%
the door but I don't know that yet so
I'm<00:16:41.240><c> going</c><00:16:41.540><c> to</c><00:16:41.570><c> walk</c><00:16:41.780><c> as</c><00:16:41.990><c> that</c><00:16:42.140><c> seems</c><00:16:42.320><c> to</c><00:16:42.500><c> be</c>

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:42.590 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk as that seems to be
 

00:16:42.590 --> 00:16:44.260 align:start position:0%
I'm going to walk as that seems to be
the<00:16:42.710><c> best</c><00:16:42.890><c> way</c><00:16:43.010><c> to</c><00:16:43.040><c> do</c><00:16:43.280><c> it</c><00:16:43.430><c> and</c><00:16:43.970><c> the</c><00:16:44.090><c> most</c>

00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:44.270 align:start position:0%
the best way to do it and the most
 

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.250 align:start position:0%
the best way to do it and the most
practical<00:16:44.660><c> um</c><00:16:45.110><c> and</c><00:16:45.950><c> that's</c><00:16:46.880><c> yeah</c><00:16:47.810><c> but</c><00:16:48.080><c> that's</c>

00:16:48.250 --> 00:16:48.260 align:start position:0%
practical um and that's yeah but that's
 

00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.970 align:start position:0%
practical um and that's yeah but that's
just<00:16:48.470><c> using</c><00:16:48.890><c> reason</c><00:16:49.280><c> so</c><00:16:50.000><c> it's</c><00:16:50.450><c> I</c><00:16:50.810><c> mean</c><00:16:51.770><c> I</c><00:16:51.860><c> know</c>
