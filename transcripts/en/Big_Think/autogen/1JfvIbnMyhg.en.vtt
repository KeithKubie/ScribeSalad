00:00:03.959 --> 00:00:08.920
It's important for us to know what's real
in the world and if we're going to be making

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:15.309
decisions about our own lives or about healthcare
policy, environmental policy, what to eat,

00:00:15.309 --> 00:00:19.590
what to do in terms of medications, we need
to know what reality is â€“ that way we're

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:22.199
not constantly smacking ourselves up against
it.

00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:26.810
It is true, certainly in politics, that it
can be very difficult to get people to agree

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:34.550
on basic facts, but I think it is possible
in some circumstances to basically turn to

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:40.420
scholars and experts in fields and ask them
to try to help adjudicate what is real and

00:00:40.420 --> 00:00:42.060
what is false.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:47.059
And increasingly, because of the polarization
within politics, there are more and more think

00:00:47.059 --> 00:00:51.269
tanks that are on both the right and the left
that are actually very serious about facts

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:58.070
because they're worried about this kind of
denigration into a situation where everybody

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:00.730
just believes what they want to believe.

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:02.100
I think we're about to see a big corrective.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:05.810
I mean the fact that you're even asking these
questions suggests to me that we're seeing

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:11.280
a corrective where people are interested in
trying to get closer to reality.

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:15.890
And I actually see that on the right as well,
within scholarship that is right of center,

00:01:15.890 --> 00:01:18.600
within foundations that are right of center.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:23.170
There certainly are some on both extremes
that are interested just yelling their idea,

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.560
whether or not it's real, there are various
people who come to mind, but there's more

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:33.880
and more interest in trying to do the corrective
and trying to understand what's serious and

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:34.880
real.

00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:40.219
We see this, for example, with conservatives
becoming very concerned around climate change.

00:01:40.219 --> 00:01:44.110
We see this I think on the left with regard
to people who have historically said patients

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:47.659
should have full autonomy, beginning to think
about well what does that mean when patients

00:01:47.659 --> 00:01:52.259
have false knowledge when, for example, they
think the measles vaccine is very dangerous

00:01:52.259 --> 00:01:55.039
when science suggests that it is not very
dangerous?

00:01:55.039 --> 00:02:02.789
When they think that doing placenta treatments
on their skin is somehow important and safe

00:02:02.789 --> 00:02:05.320
and scientific when it's really not.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:08.850
So I think that corrective is helping.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:10.940
How do we as individuals understand what is
true?

00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:12.320
It is really hard.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:18.340
There is so much noise and there is so many
things that look convincing that are not convincing.

00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:23.470
That's a relatively new thing in history to
have the level at which people are able to

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:31.080
produce things that look real and high level,
high quality, high scholarly levels that are

00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.660
not real is kind of terrifying.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:39.530
So there are fake journals that look real,
there are fake news stories, as we know, that

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:46.950
appear to be real and it becomes increasingly
difficult to understand what is real.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.290
For the average person, it's very hard to
know what to trust, but there are some trusted

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:57.060
places like, for example, Wikipedia, Snopes,
various places that do fact checking.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.590
There are various newspapers that do fact
checking as well, factcheck.org for example

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:03.140
is another place.

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:08.090
But then in order for those places to survive
it's really clear that people have to financially

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:14.540
support them so that people can do that work
and it's hard to convince people to support

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:20.510
nonpartisan fact checking work because people
have been taught to favor, with their clicks

00:03:20.510 --> 00:03:25.750
and their dollars and their like buttons,
to favor opinion that they agree with.

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:33.090
It's very rare for people comparatively to
forward actual articles compared to forwarding

00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:35.290
opinion pieces.

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:40.050
So what we see is that the kinds of things
that come under your nose because your friends

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:45.870
are sharing it or your colleagues are sharing
it is much more often opinion than facts.

00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.731
We don't have the idea that we should stick
a like on something that's just factual, forward

00:03:50.731 --> 00:03:53.110
it to a friend if it's simply factual.

00:03:53.110 --> 00:03:57.760
We want the opinion analysis of it that agrees
with our opinion of what the facts mean and

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.080
that's the thing we forward.

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:05.670
And I don't know how to solve that problem
other than to say if people with money don't

00:04:05.670 --> 00:04:10.360
start supporting fact-checking systems then
fact-checking systems will become increasingly

00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.360
rarer.

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.860
So the newspaper I run in East Lansing does
political fact checking.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:19.530
When the mailers come out for the latest local
campaign, whether that's for city council

00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:23.830
or for school board or for various tax proposals
we take the mailers and we do fact checking.

00:04:23.830 --> 00:04:28.810
This is not a novel concept, newspapers have
been doing this for years, but it's increasingly

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.950
unusual for mainstream newspapers to take
the time to do that kind of fact checking,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:34.940
especially on the candidates they're endorsing.

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.860
It's one reason we don't endorse candidates
at my newspaper because we believe very firmly

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:40.669
that that's not our job.

00:04:40.669 --> 00:04:44.699
Our job is not to tell people what to think,
our job is to bring forward what we know.

00:04:44.699 --> 00:04:48.610
And, in the past, newspapers had more of a
commitment to that, but that's not where the

00:04:48.610 --> 00:04:49.610
money is.

00:04:49.610 --> 00:04:54.389
When people subscribe to newspapers they do
it not for the information, they do it often

00:04:54.389 --> 00:04:59.430
because of the opinion pages, because of the
op-ed pages, because of the editorials.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:03.050
So newspapers are stuck in the position where
that's what they have to do in order to support

00:05:03.050 --> 00:05:04.330
the news side of the organization.
