BRADLEY KUHN: I'm Bradley Kuhn.

00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:04.110
I'm the president of the
Software Freedom Conservancy.

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:07.740
The Software Freedom Conservancy
is a nonprofit charity.

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:11.950
And our basic mission
is to do for open source

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.090
and free software projects
all the things that developers

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:18.490
don't like to do that are
very important for open source

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.780
and free software projects.

00:00:19.780 --> 00:00:23.610
So developers are very good
at writing great free software

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:24.860
and documentation.

00:00:24.860 --> 00:00:26.640
But they're often
not so great at

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.680
the organizational and
infrastructural and logistical

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:31.760
work that a nonprofit
can do for them.

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:33.840
So we take care of that
work so the volunteers

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:36.180
can keep writing
great free software.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:39.370
GSoC is really an amazing
program for the conservancy

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:43.100
because we're an aggregate
umbrella organization.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:46.190
So we have many different
open source and free software

00:00:46.190 --> 00:00:48.420
projects under our umbrella.

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:51.760
And many of those are
in GSoC every year.

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.580
It averages between 6%
and 12% of all of GSoC

00:00:55.580 --> 00:00:57.490
are Conservancy member projects.

00:00:57.490 --> 00:01:01.290
And in fact, we get many new
applicants who come into GSoC

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.830
and have a real interest
in joining Conservancy

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:07.550
because it's often the first
moment when they realize

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:09.380
they need
infrastructural services.

00:01:09.380 --> 00:01:11.190
And I'll explain what I mean.

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.120
Most people don't realize
that GSoC is probably

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:18.560
the largest annual philanthropic
program for open source

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.760
and free software
in existence today.

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:24.490
It gives away a tremendous
amount of revenue and resources

00:01:24.490 --> 00:01:27.420
to important open source
and free software projects.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.170
And it's often the first
moments that a project realizes

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.660
that there might be revenue
coming in-- donations

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.950
from Google, for example-- that
need to be handled by someone.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.750
And the best place,
in my view, to handle

00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:40.970
that is at a nonprofit
charity, which can then

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.710
put the resources to good use
to further advance the project.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:47.300
So in fact, every year we
get many new applicants

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:51.092
to Conservancy who have
joined the GSoC program

00:01:51.092 --> 00:01:53.550
and realized that it would be
just great if they could have

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:56.230
a nonprofit that could handle
the details of the logistics

00:01:56.230 --> 00:01:58.920
of coordinating with Google,
to receive the donations,

00:01:58.920 --> 00:02:01.980
and to get them to this mentor
summit conference and so forth.

00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:05.330
I think that the GSoC program
is incredibly well designed

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:06.500
right now.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:09.000
And one of the great things
that happens for my organization

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.730
through GSoC is it
basically identifies

00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:13.580
great new open source
and free software

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:16.796
projects that would make great
members for our organization.

00:02:16.796 --> 00:02:18.420
Many of our applicants,
as I mentioned,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:20.450
have come through
the GSoC program

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:22.070
and decided to apply to us.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:25.000
And this year we had eight
of our member projects

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.150
participating in GSoC.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:28.720
And my goal really is to
encourage more of our projects

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.780
to be engaged and to offer
our services to those

00:02:31.780 --> 00:02:33.020
who have discovered GSoC.

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.390
They might discover that
they also might find value

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.340
in being part of a
nonprofit charity

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:41.510
to do programs like
GSoC elsewhere as well.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:44.260
So if you run an open source
or free software project

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.840
and you don't have any sort
of organizational affiliation

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.970
yet-- normally, this is
how most projects exist.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.080
They're a ragtag
band of volunteers

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.970
trying to make
great, free software.

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.470
They should certainly a look
at Conservancy's website at

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.140
sfconservancy.org and look at
our applications' instructions.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.120
We're always welcoming
new applications

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:05.020
of projects that want to have
the benefits of being part

00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.739
of a nonprofit
organization but want

00:03:06.739 --> 00:03:08.530
to stay focused on what
they do best, which

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:10.930
is open source and free
software development.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.800
I believe we were in the
very first GSoC program.

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.360
I think we had one
or two projects.

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.210
I think our Inkscape
member project

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:20.850
was one of the first
in the very first GSoC.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.680
And every year we've
had more and more

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:25.610
of our projects in GSoC.

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:27.890
Amusingly, percentage
goes down because GSoC

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:29.430
keeps growing so big.

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:32.770
But we always have
at least seven

00:03:32.770 --> 00:03:35.194
or eight of our projects
in GSoC every year.

00:03:35.194 --> 00:03:37.110
I, myself, have not been
a mentor for a while.

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.940
I was a mentor back in 2006.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:42.520
But I sort of serve the role of
what I call a meadow org admin.

00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:45.500
So I coordinate with all the
org admins of our projects

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:46.750
who are in Conservancy.

00:03:46.750 --> 00:03:48.910
And I help them do all
those logistical things

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:51.160
I was talking about, like
getting their flights booked

00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.420
here to the conference, making
sure they get reimbursed,

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:57.630
making it easy for Google to
give money to the projects.

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:00.950
So we do a single invoice for
Google for all our projects.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:02.830
And the reason we do
that is because we

00:04:02.830 --> 00:04:05.570
want to make it easy for Google
to help us and make it easy

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.160
for them to process
helping out our projects.

00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:10.900
So we try to do our best to
make it very easy for Google

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:12.050
to help out projects.

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.675
Well, if you're a
developer, you should

00:04:13.675 --> 00:04:16.029
look at all the different
Conservancy projects that

00:04:16.029 --> 00:04:18.930
exist and think about
contributing to those.

00:04:18.930 --> 00:04:22.660
One of the great things
about the GSoC program

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:25.340
is that it brings together
the most diverse group

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:26.752
of free software projects.

00:04:26.752 --> 00:04:28.960
When I look at our organization,
the Software Freedom

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.730
Conservancy, we have so many
different member projects

00:04:31.730 --> 00:04:35.290
in so many different areas
of free software development.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.990
The mentor summit
is the place that I

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.970
can come to see all of
them, because they never

00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.950
go to the same conference except
for this one, because GSoC has

00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:44.470
done such a good job
at bringing together

00:04:44.470 --> 00:04:46.260
all these different
free software projects

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:48.320
and getting them to talk
to each other in ways

00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:51.170
that really no other
program today does.

00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.024
The Software Freedom Conservancy
is at sfconservancy.org.

00:04:54.024 --> 00:04:56.190
And there are links to all
our member projects there

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:58.090
and information on how
to join and volunteer

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.214
for the Software Freedom
Conservancy and our member

00:05:00.214 --> 00:05:01.450
projects.
