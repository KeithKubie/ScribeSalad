00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.890
Two important TLS concepts are the TLS
sessions and the TLS connection.

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:09.320
A TLS session is an association
between a client and

00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.480
a server that is created
by the Handshake Protocol.

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:15.970
It defines a set of
cryptographic parameters

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:20.100
that are used by a set of
connections within the session.

00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:24.099
So that we can avoid repeated
expensive negotiation of new

00:00:24.099 --> 00:00:27.369
security parameters for
each new connection.

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.016
A TLS connection is a transport layer
relationship between a client and

00:00:32.016 --> 00:00:32.720
a server.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:38.016
For example, a TLS connection can be
an email connection between a client and

00:00:38.016 --> 00:00:41.700
a server, or
it can be a set of such connections.

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:46.150
A TLS connection is transient, for
example if the client terminates

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:49.765
the email connection,
the TLS connection may terminate.

00:00:49.765 --> 00:00:54.892
Whereas TLS session is much
longer term because it is created

00:00:54.892 --> 00:00:59.840
by a Handshake Protocol rather than a a
transport layer service such as email,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.770
each TLS connection is
part of a TLS session.

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:07.070
Therefore, negotiation of
new security parameters for

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:08.750
each connection can be avoided.
