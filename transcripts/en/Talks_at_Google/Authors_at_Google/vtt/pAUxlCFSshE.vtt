MIKE BASICH: Thanks
for having me here.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.630
I'm really excited to be
here today to spend an hour

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:14.890
or so talking and share
my perspective, which

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:17.690
is my main sharing [INAUDIBLE]
what I want to do today

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.600
is share my perspective
of what I've

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:24.080
done with my life and
the level of risk.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:26.770
So much I've learned
through my childhood, which

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:28.510
I've lived kind of
a unique childhood

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:33.220
with epilepsy, which has been
kind of from five years old

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:35.320
till about 13.

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:37.690
And of course, one
of those unexpected

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:43.970
journeys that 20 years later I
realize the tools it gave me.

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:48.340
And why I say that is I gained
a different perspective.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:50.620
I owe this a lot to
my mom and my dad

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.020
for putting in front of
me different options.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.060
And those were things that more
were about exercising the mind,

00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:00.060
trying to fight
epilepsy, which is

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:01.900
a joining of both
sides of the brain

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.730
together, firing seizures.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:08.080
So in the beginning
of that journey,

00:01:08.080 --> 00:01:12.970
I did a lot of mental drawings,
little different doctors

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:17.800
of putting puzzles together,
trying to use a focus.

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:21.220
And what it came
down to was actually

00:01:21.220 --> 00:01:25.420
a food diet and snowboarding,
which I owe a lot

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:29.260
to my healing of epilepsy.

00:01:29.260 --> 00:01:34.120
This took about three years
of a certain kind of diet.

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.060
And snowboarding, I
kind of use that word

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:41.350
as a healing tool for me because
it was a big focus for me.

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:44.650
It's something I felt like
I was grounded in the world.

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:47.092
And this is in the mid '80s.

00:01:47.092 --> 00:01:49.300
And I don't know if you know
a lot about snowboarding

00:01:49.300 --> 00:01:53.360
in the '80s and into the '90s,
it was not a welcome sport.

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.780
And so that was
kind of, in a way,

00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:00.020
a perfect fit because I didn't
fit in any way in school.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:02.800
And so my journey
with all of this--

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.570
again, kind of what
I owe to my parents

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:08.330
is the OK of being different.

00:02:08.330 --> 00:02:10.509
And those things
is the things I've

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.980
learned 20 years later on
why my career in snowboarding

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:20.840
went the way it did and why I
did the things that I do now,

00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.000
which is a lot about
just feeling in action,

00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.550
doing things, seeing
where it goes,

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:32.110
what resonates inside
to self growth.

00:02:32.110 --> 00:02:35.140
And in snowboarding, it
kind of put me in a spot

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:37.780
where I kind of followed for
a while the World Tour, World

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:39.695
Cup, did the competition.

00:02:39.695 --> 00:02:42.460
We were all developing
the sport together,

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:45.520
so we kind of shaped
how things were run.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:49.210
But after about 20
years later I realized

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.330
I was kind of growing out
of the competition scene.

00:02:52.330 --> 00:02:54.970
And with my childhood
of just trying

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.390
to take on different
things different ways,

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.640
I saw a different
perspective in snowboarding

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:02.980
that wasn't developed yet.

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.720
I was photographed a
lot in snowboarding.

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:09.130
I had a lot of ideas at the same
time how to be photographed.

00:03:09.130 --> 00:03:12.010
Working with two different
minds to create an image

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:13.910
can be very
challenging sometimes,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:18.160
especially when you're the
one on risk with your life

00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:23.030
and feeling the power of passion
for what you're actually doing.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:27.700
And so I've slowly started to
develop these different parts

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.500
of cameras, joining.

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:33.220
I hired someone to do some
soldering for some wires

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:36.260
and I've started
taking self portraits.

00:03:36.260 --> 00:03:38.140
This is in the late '90s.

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:43.660
And I realized this was a huge
room, a space to figure out

00:03:43.660 --> 00:03:46.660
what else could come to.

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.260
And at the time my career, I
was getting at an age where

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:53.500
snowboarding didn't really want
to sponsor someone in their mid

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:59.050
20s to compete because the 19-,
15-year-old is going to beat me

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.070
out.

00:04:00.070 --> 00:04:02.590
So it was up to me, if I
wanted to stay in snowboarding,

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:07.160
to recreate myself, reinvent
who I was in the sport.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:11.230
And so the self-portrait
world became my focus

00:04:11.230 --> 00:04:15.070
and gave me a whole other
15 years as a career.

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:16.870
I'm 45 years old now.

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.589
I still have sponsors as a
snowboarding professional,

00:04:20.589 --> 00:04:25.240
and it's really
based on creativity.

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.020
And that space of
creativity has changed

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:32.110
over the 15 years I've
been doing self portraits,

00:04:32.110 --> 00:04:34.720
a lot because of technology
has come into the game

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:36.610
in different ways.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:40.000
Back in when I started, I had
about a 40-pound backpack.

00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:41.914
You'd have to hike
everything twice

00:04:41.914 --> 00:04:43.330
to get the shot
because you'd have

00:04:43.330 --> 00:04:48.112
to hike, set the camera up,
and then ride and go back

00:04:48.112 --> 00:04:48.820
into your camera.

00:04:48.820 --> 00:04:51.580
So one photo could take weeks.

00:04:51.580 --> 00:04:54.490
Now we have GoPro cameras,
different smaller cameras

00:04:54.490 --> 00:04:57.140
that you can do
something very quick.

00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:59.140
And when that
happened, I realized

00:04:59.140 --> 00:05:02.350
I want to keep progressing
with self portraits.

00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.300
And so I worked
with a paraglider.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:09.100
I bought a motorized
paraglider, and wanting

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.840
to capture something
that was storming up

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.180
in my mind of
different perspective.

00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.070
And it wasn't until
10 years later

00:05:15.070 --> 00:05:18.910
after that that I actually
got to do another image that

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:21.730
brought something
new to me, which

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.750
was kind of following
like a bird, which is now

00:05:25.750 --> 00:05:27.460
the drone world.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:29.530
And I wanted to
show a little bit

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:33.340
of a little one-minute
video of my first 10 years

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:35.600
of shooting self portraits.

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:37.780
And this is mostly--

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:43.780
well, this is all with a
ASLR, about a 15-pound camera.

00:05:43.780 --> 00:05:47.514
And enjoy this for a minute.

00:05:47.514 --> 00:05:48.180
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.400
- Winter we've had for the
nine years I lived there,

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.768
so a lot of fun.

00:05:52.768 --> 00:05:54.643
But after the winter,
I was kind of like, ah,

00:05:54.643 --> 00:05:58.240
I want to really capture what
I'm seeing in snowboarding,

00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.530
what I'm feeling.

00:05:59.530 --> 00:06:02.087
So I went and spent
$600 on remotes.

00:06:02.087 --> 00:06:03.670
I didn't know a lot
about photography,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:07.660
but I had this first
photo I wanted to capture.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.080
Took me actually about
five weeks to do it.

00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:14.320
I ended up failing and
trying it again, really

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.970
wanting to capture what
snowboarding was to me on film

00:06:18.970 --> 00:06:21.190
and think I could
actually share it

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:26.020
with my family and the industry.

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:28.589
That's how I started
taking self portraits.

00:06:28.589 --> 00:06:32.082
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:08:28.540 --> 00:08:29.990
- The helicopter drop--

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:32.090
it was a couple of
year project of where

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:36.559
I wanted to really capture a
photo that looked impossible.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:39.049
The whole idea was
to shoot the shot

00:08:39.049 --> 00:08:43.049
and not have the
helicopter in the frame.

00:08:43.049 --> 00:08:45.380
And so it needed to
be big and Alaska

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:47.420
was the best spot to do it.

00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:50.400
I drove all the way up there
pretty much just to do that.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:53.210
So once I left the helicopter,
I realized I'm never

00:08:53.210 --> 00:08:54.950
going to experience this again.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:57.440
It's like that in
between a flying squirrel

00:08:57.440 --> 00:09:00.890
and a drop in a cliff.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.160
But after a couple of people
saw the photo afterwards,

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:08.687
I started to realize
maybe snowboarding

00:09:08.687 --> 00:09:10.895
isn't ready for this or it's
not really snowboarding.

00:09:10.895 --> 00:09:15.110
I'm on a snowboard,
but it was more

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:16.670
on the artistic
side of just wanting

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:20.890
to create something
different, unique.

00:09:20.890 --> 00:09:23.150
And so that's how it got shaped.

00:09:23.150 --> 00:09:25.800
It turned out great.

00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:26.637
I was stoked.

00:09:26.637 --> 00:09:28.970
Unfortunately, no one really
ran it the way I wanted to,

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:31.827
but oh, well.

00:09:31.827 --> 00:09:32.660
I got it on my wall.

00:09:35.498 --> 00:09:38.340
[END PLAYBACK]

00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.450
MIKE BASICH: So that's the first
10 years of my self portrait

00:09:42.450 --> 00:09:43.530
career.

00:09:43.530 --> 00:09:46.050
And one of the biggest things
I wanted to share about it

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.880
as well as the challenge to
make a company invest in me.

00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.400
It's a never ending story.

00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:57.780
Even after 15 years of
shooting self portraits,

00:09:57.780 --> 00:10:01.380
I came to one of my sponsors
a time, which was GoPro,

00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:04.200
and said, I got an
idea I want to do.

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:07.560
I want to ride with adrenaline
and release it halfway

00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:09.270
down the mountain.

00:10:09.270 --> 00:10:12.845
And it took me six
months to convince them.

00:10:12.845 --> 00:10:14.220
I didn't actually
convince them I

00:10:14.220 --> 00:10:15.930
forced them, in
a way, which I've

00:10:15.930 --> 00:10:20.730
learned to use the media how to
leak stuff out and put people

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.880
in the spot that they feel
like they should invest.

00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:27.930
And this was one of them,
which was pretty interesting.

00:10:27.930 --> 00:10:28.750
It worked out.

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.010
They actually made a worldwide
TV commercial out of it.

00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:35.910
But again, it's one of the
hard things as an individual

00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:40.364
to come to a huge company
and say, this is my idea.

00:10:40.364 --> 00:10:42.030
I don't know how it's
going to turn out,

00:10:42.030 --> 00:10:44.980
but just can you believe in me?

00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.520
And that's been probably
the hardest thing

00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:52.110
to pave the way in snowboarding
for a 45-year-old athlete

00:10:52.110 --> 00:10:55.590
to continue in the industry.

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:59.980
And the level risk is kind
of what I mentioned earlier,

00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.810
which a lot of the reason
why this worked was I

00:11:03.810 --> 00:11:06.360
was kind of the only one
who was willing to risk

00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.200
$5,000 in camera
equipment in the air.

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.600
I had the athletic
ability to ride,

00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:16.320
but it was also really about
two things coming together

00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:18.610
that no one else
was willing to do.

00:11:18.610 --> 00:11:22.170
And I would lean on that
a lot because that's

00:11:22.170 --> 00:11:24.960
kind of how I see a lot
of things happen my life.

00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:29.040
Even today my lifestyle, living
off the grid, which I do,

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:32.190
is a collision of what
I can have access to

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.920
and what I personally
want to do with my life.

00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.780
So there's the TV
commercial I wanted

00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:42.070
to show you as well, this
releasing moment of a camera,

00:11:42.070 --> 00:11:45.300
which is one of the reasons
I bought that motorized

00:11:45.300 --> 00:11:46.170
paraglider.

00:11:46.170 --> 00:11:49.680
I wanted to capture
this moving out

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:51.880
of the perspective of the body.

00:11:51.880 --> 00:11:57.480
And so here we are a
good 12 years later on,

00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:59.410
making that actually
a reality for me,

00:11:59.410 --> 00:12:01.260
which has been very fun.

00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.001
Here it is on YouTube.

00:12:04.001 --> 00:12:04.667

00:12:36.990 --> 00:12:41.470
- Wherever the home is,
you can't get homesick.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:42.928
It's really that simple.

[END PLAYBACK]

00:12:52.320 --> 00:12:53.550
MIKE BASICH: So that
was another project

00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:55.230
that took a lot
of fighting to do,

00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:57.630
which I don't know if
it's interesting at all,

00:12:57.630 --> 00:13:00.000
but it was a very
big moment for me

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.090
in my photography
and content world.

00:13:03.090 --> 00:13:05.940
It's kind of what my
job is these days.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:09.150
I come up creative
ideas, try to figure out

00:13:09.150 --> 00:13:12.000
how to do something new
and supply it to a company

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.470
to market it or create new
devices that kind of fit

00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:18.850
that idea better.

00:13:18.850 --> 00:13:22.020
And there's one other one that
I think I'd like to show you,

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:25.200
that I think you would
actually have seen it here

00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:31.500
because what I've been told this
device GoPro and Google brought

00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:34.800
to market a few
years after this.

00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:36.210
So please share your thoughts.

00:13:36.210 --> 00:13:37.164

00:13:37.164 --> 00:13:38.595
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:13:42.873 --> 00:13:44.655
- At any moment
when you're riding,

00:13:44.655 --> 00:13:49.350
you can just freeze the moment
and move around anywhere

00:13:49.350 --> 00:13:50.460
you want to go.

00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.150
Continue, stop.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:55.770
The objects of these cameras
mounted the way I did

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:59.910
was just giving you the
freedom to edit at any angle.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:02.320
Built some plywood,
little handle.

00:14:02.320 --> 00:14:07.090
I got 13 cameras, which once
you get them all recording,

00:14:07.090 --> 00:14:10.376
there is no way to register
them all, which the way

00:14:10.376 --> 00:14:14.590
I did it was pretty old school,
just to build the time card.

00:14:14.590 --> 00:14:17.180
And this one is round.

00:14:17.180 --> 00:14:19.345
Once you get it
going, recording,

00:14:19.345 --> 00:14:23.550
move it at the same time,
that's your registration point.

00:14:23.550 --> 00:14:27.660
Same time, so you can go two
minutes and three seconds

00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:32.010
on each shot and find the
same moment and move around,

00:14:32.010 --> 00:14:35.440
and then continue with
one going a certain way.

00:14:35.440 --> 00:14:37.330
Stop, go around.

00:14:37.330 --> 00:14:41.940
and just to share more
of the 360-degree feeling

00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.990
you get when you're
snowboarding or doing anything.

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:48.070
Just the eyes are
such a beautiful tool

00:14:48.070 --> 00:14:50.177
to receive stuff.

00:14:50.177 --> 00:14:50.760
[END PLAYBACK]

00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.260
MIKE BASICH: So
that's kind of where

00:14:52.260 --> 00:14:55.410
I'm standing with my career
as far as a photographer

00:14:55.410 --> 00:14:57.390
and an athlete.

00:14:57.390 --> 00:15:02.310
And I've recently have
brought in my lifetime passion

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.220
of working with my
hands, woodworking,

00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:09.600
and trying to value life.

00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:11.190
That's one of the
main things I'm

00:15:11.190 --> 00:15:14.190
trying to learn how to do
every day by getting my hands

00:15:14.190 --> 00:15:18.930
dirty, kind of trying to
learn the things that I

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:22.710
use in my life and
try to do it myself.

00:15:22.710 --> 00:15:24.770
So I've chosen to
live off the grid.

00:15:24.770 --> 00:15:27.030
I live in a
300-square-foot cabin

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:32.280
on 40 acres off about three
miles off any power grid.

00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:36.720
And I've been learning
the way of raising

00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:41.580
my consciousness on how I move
in the world and what I use.

00:15:41.580 --> 00:15:45.030
And I wanted to share a
different perspective that

00:15:45.030 --> 00:15:47.490
isn't exactly pretty.

00:15:47.490 --> 00:15:51.030
The more I know,
the harder it gets.

00:15:51.030 --> 00:15:57.720
And I know you guys are here
a lot to supply information.

00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:03.530
And it's interesting
to strive to know more,

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.910
to want to have a closer
connection to the world of what

00:16:05.910 --> 00:16:07.360
happens.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:11.400
And that's my continuous goal.

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.670
And I'm kind of wanting also
to have a conversation with you

00:16:14.670 --> 00:16:19.550
all on how to manage, how
to balance information

00:16:19.550 --> 00:16:23.785
because I've gone in
waves of having too much,

00:16:23.785 --> 00:16:25.410
not knowing how to
do with it because I

00:16:25.410 --> 00:16:29.250
feel responsible for
what I'm learning.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:32.160
And that's something
that I've tried

00:16:32.160 --> 00:16:33.840
to figure out how to teach.

00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:40.290
I've taught at some
schools, and the best

00:16:40.290 --> 00:16:43.530
I can know to do with
all this information

00:16:43.530 --> 00:16:46.800
is to do it in action.

00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.200
And then once you put
something into action,

00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:52.680
you have another feeling
that can overtake

00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:55.020
the mind of just information.

00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:58.500
And that has to do a lot
with the heart, whatever

00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.910
it's resonated in you.

00:16:59.910 --> 00:17:03.540
Not everything does
that I do, so I

00:17:03.540 --> 00:17:05.640
don't have a strong
connection with it

00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:07.589
and I'll move on to
something that is.

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.430
And what I've
learned why that is,

00:17:11.430 --> 00:17:14.790
at least from my perspective,
is that we're all

00:17:14.790 --> 00:17:17.760
born with something first.

00:17:17.760 --> 00:17:21.270
The first organ that's
formed is the heart.

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:22.670
That's kind of what takes place.

00:17:22.670 --> 00:17:24.990
It's our main seed.

00:17:24.990 --> 00:17:27.329
And that was the
one thing that I

00:17:27.329 --> 00:17:32.010
keep going back to for all my
answers that I can't answer.

00:17:32.010 --> 00:17:35.010
And that's the one
thing somewhere

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.690
in me is knowing
what to do with it

00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:45.870
and back to resonating by
doing something in action.

00:17:45.870 --> 00:17:50.670
And I'd love to talk to you
all about what resonates.

00:17:50.670 --> 00:17:52.250
I know snowboarding has for me.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:56.120
Living off the grid, being
closer to the indigenous

00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:59.090
needs of what we
need to live life.

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:02.300
I don't expect myself or
everyone to do everything

00:18:02.300 --> 00:18:05.090
that we need to do because
that's the beauty of working

00:18:05.090 --> 00:18:06.970
together to do something.

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:12.410
And I mean that in a way where
I've learned to hike my water

00:18:12.410 --> 00:18:15.374
miles just to brush my teeth.

00:18:15.374 --> 00:18:16.790
And then you can
imagine if you do

00:18:16.790 --> 00:18:19.010
that, you have some
sort of exhilaration

00:18:19.010 --> 00:18:21.680
like you just ran a marathon
and all you have to do

00:18:21.680 --> 00:18:25.100
is brush your
teeth to feel that.

00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.630
And that is simply being more
connected with what we do,

00:18:29.630 --> 00:18:32.570
what we use.

00:18:32.570 --> 00:18:37.100
And again, it's not
the same for everybody.

00:18:37.100 --> 00:18:39.840
It's really what
resonates in the heart

00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:41.780
because that's kind
of, really, that's

00:18:41.780 --> 00:18:44.110
all we have to lean back on.

00:18:44.110 --> 00:18:46.010
At least that's my perspective.

00:18:46.010 --> 00:18:49.280
And so I wanted to
show another video

00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.310
of my other part
of my life outside

00:18:51.310 --> 00:18:54.500
of the snowboard
career, of where

00:18:54.500 --> 00:18:59.150
my heart resonates the most
and what that looks like over--

00:18:59.150 --> 00:19:01.760
it's been about 15 years now
putting that more and more

00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:03.258
to action.

00:19:03.258 --> 00:19:07.090
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:19:07.090 --> 00:19:09.880
- It wasn't till I
was 33 that I finally

00:19:09.880 --> 00:19:12.160
felt it was time to
bring this childhood

00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:17.110
dream to life of building my
own house my own two hands.

00:19:17.110 --> 00:19:20.920
Came across these beautiful
40 acres in Donner summit.

00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:24.340
When I first saw
it, I was like, this

00:19:24.340 --> 00:19:26.660
is the beginning of my dream.

00:19:26.660 --> 00:19:27.460
It's buried.

00:19:27.460 --> 00:19:29.750
Which that winter was a
huge winter in the snow.

00:19:29.750 --> 00:19:33.140
I got to experience
a place with a teepee

00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.010
and get a feeling for the area.

00:19:36.010 --> 00:19:39.170
Finishing my winter off
in Alaska, I was like,

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:42.100
what kind of shape
does this house

00:19:42.100 --> 00:19:45.190
that I'm going to build, this
dream, what kind of shape

00:19:45.190 --> 00:19:47.320
does it have?

00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:50.740
And with most things,
you've got to really let

00:19:50.740 --> 00:19:54.400
go of all your ideas,
close your eyes,

00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:58.470
and like, what's
this really about?

00:19:58.470 --> 00:20:03.925
And I started to realize
it was about me, my heart.

00:20:03.925 --> 00:20:09.850
And it was like, where does
this experience of feeling

00:20:09.850 --> 00:20:10.930
most alive--

00:20:10.930 --> 00:20:13.600
where does this live?

00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:17.470
I started to realize this was
standing on a mountain peak.

00:20:17.470 --> 00:20:19.820
This is where, in
the past 33 years,

00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:23.870
this is where I've
felt most alive.

00:20:23.870 --> 00:20:27.220
I started looking at all these
photos and I'm like, wow.

00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.500
There's a shape to this feeling,
standing on a mountain peak

00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.060
and reaching out to the world.

00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.370
This is the start of
an idea, off a feeling.

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.360
And I think everyone
can relate this feeling.

00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:41.720
It's just where you're high
on life and feel most alive.

00:20:41.720 --> 00:20:44.210
Like, everyone has
that certain structure,

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:48.450
just reaching out as well,
keeping your feet grounded.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:52.205
And from there on, it just
started to take shape.

00:20:52.205 --> 00:20:56.710
I'm like, oh, I've
got to draw this down.

00:20:56.710 --> 00:20:59.650
And soon as I knew
it, I was experiencing

00:20:59.650 --> 00:21:03.310
something that's been
experienced for hundreds

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:04.780
and hundreds of years.

00:21:04.780 --> 00:21:09.280
You see this drawing of a star
connecting to all your dots

00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:10.990
on your body.

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:12.615
And if you connect
them the other way,

00:21:12.615 --> 00:21:15.520
it becomes a pentagon.

00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.930
So I think if you
go off of instinct

00:21:18.930 --> 00:21:21.300
or you go off the
golden ratio, you're

00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:23.550
going to end up
with the same thing.

00:21:23.550 --> 00:21:25.650
Of course, you have to
really let go and listen

00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:30.160
to that heartbeat.

00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:34.130
Go where, where does that
heartbeat feel most alive?

00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.490
For me it was staying
on the mountain, where

00:21:37.490 --> 00:21:40.910
I realized that's what I want
my house to be because that's

00:21:40.910 --> 00:21:42.538
where I felt most alive.

00:21:42.538 --> 00:21:45.526
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:45.000
- The great thing about taking
on a project in this way

00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:48.640
is that everything naturally
happens afterwards.

00:22:48.640 --> 00:22:52.070
Where your feet are is where
the front door should be.

00:22:52.070 --> 00:22:55.980
Where your arm's reaching out
is where your window should be.

00:22:55.980 --> 00:22:59.250
The hardest part has been
dealing with the weather,

00:22:59.250 --> 00:23:01.420
mixing cement in the snow.

00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:04.530
But it's really what I
wanted is to put myself

00:23:04.530 --> 00:23:08.220
in a place I got back to
the basics of simple living.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.960
Living off the grid
has been something

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.330
that's always wanted to do.

00:23:12.330 --> 00:23:14.880
And looking around with what
I had to work with was I

00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:16.280
had a lot of rocks.

00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:18.390
That's what really
survived up here.

00:23:18.390 --> 00:23:21.780
And so my house became
built out of rock.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:23.370
I had no idea it's
going to take me

00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.190
four years to build
my house, but it

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.460
was one of those
projects and again, it's

00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:33.060
the way for me to find
out and express who I was.

00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.090
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:24:04.018 --> 00:24:05.006
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.360
MIKE BASICH: So
that was my project

00:24:10.360 --> 00:24:13.310
of finding my
place in the world.

00:24:13.310 --> 00:24:17.410
And what I've learned, which
the biggest part I learned

00:24:17.410 --> 00:24:20.290
about that project was time.

00:24:20.290 --> 00:24:22.200
Imagine being by
yourself in the woods.

00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:26.210
You work with time,
especially when it's snowing.

00:24:26.210 --> 00:24:29.740
And I realized that's
a lot to do with motion

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.510
and back onto the golden ratio.

00:24:31.510 --> 00:24:33.880
I don't know if a lot about
the golden ratio, but it's

00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:37.279
the basics of quantum
physics, how we all built--

00:24:37.279 --> 00:24:39.070
everything else is kind
of built under that

00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:45.490
unless you go outside of that
equation, which we all do.

00:24:45.490 --> 00:24:47.920
But what I truly--
back to the heart

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.210
has a natural instinct that
is based on the golden ratio,

00:24:52.210 --> 00:24:55.577
that I feel like is a great
balance to find out the stuff

00:24:55.577 --> 00:24:57.160
I'm struggling with,
as I was sharing.

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.680
Like sometimes there's too much.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:01.480
Sometimes there's too little.

00:25:01.480 --> 00:25:05.260
And those are kind
of, I think, has a lot

00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.680
to do with being too much in the
past, too much in the future,

00:25:09.680 --> 00:25:11.450
or too much in the present.

00:25:11.450 --> 00:25:14.740
And so what I've learned,
back into the golden ratio,

00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:16.840
is to find things in thirds.

00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:19.960
You have the past,
present, and the future.

00:25:19.960 --> 00:25:21.760
The future we don't know.

00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.010
We have a way of
shaping that together.

00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:28.210
The past has already happened,
so we know what has been.

00:25:28.210 --> 00:25:32.560
And the present is of
right now, the simpleness

00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.470
of doing something that will
no longer be this moment.

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:43.500
We can record it, pass it
on, which becomes the past.

00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:47.550
And so that is a way that I've
learned to stay in balance,

00:25:47.550 --> 00:25:54.830
to stay in health, and to
continue to trust the instinct.

00:25:54.830 --> 00:25:59.550
Because as I get older,
I have more layers.

00:25:59.550 --> 00:26:01.840
I have more
experiences, more things

00:26:01.840 --> 00:26:04.270
to fight through
to figure out what

00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.690
is actually happening in here.

00:26:06.690 --> 00:26:08.440
And every time I talk
to someone that they

00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:13.090
don't know what they're doing
or what to do, I relied--

00:26:13.090 --> 00:26:17.230
go back to your childhood
when you had less layers.

00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:18.500
It's much more clear.

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:20.790
It's much more simple.

00:26:20.790 --> 00:26:24.490
And it's most of
the time very true.

00:26:24.490 --> 00:26:27.130
Whatever you were
dreaming as a child,

00:26:27.130 --> 00:26:30.520
there's something in there
that is wanting to do that.

00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:37.930
And that's my perspective today
I'm wanting to bring to you.

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.850
Don't forget about
the child in you

00:26:39.850 --> 00:26:42.230
because it is very important.

00:26:42.230 --> 00:26:44.620
It has an important
message and something

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:47.200
very important to share.

00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.687
Thank you for having me today.

00:26:49.687 --> 00:26:52.082
[APPLAUSE]

00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.490
And if anyone has any questions
about anything, please--

00:27:03.490 --> 00:27:04.020
I'm here.

00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:06.620
And I brought some books
of my self-portrait career

00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:11.012
as well that has some
other images in it that

00:27:11.012 --> 00:27:12.920
have a uniqueness to it.

00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:13.700
Yes?

00:27:13.700 --> 00:27:21.234
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] house, do
you have other people around?

00:27:21.234 --> 00:27:26.670
Or don't you miss connection
with your friends?

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:28.970
I mean, you probably have a
connection with, let's say,

00:27:28.970 --> 00:27:29.600
nature.

00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:35.180
But I would miss the
daily contact with people.

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.950
MIKE BASICH: Yeah,
it's different.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:41.840
I have a different
connection with people now.

00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.760
I have, in a way, the
same amount of people

00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:48.210
visiting me that I did
when I was in the suburbs.

00:27:48.210 --> 00:27:52.760
I lived in a huge house before
this and people are seemed

00:27:52.760 --> 00:27:55.370
always excited to do
something a little unique,

00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:57.800
and so I get people
wanting to do something

00:27:57.800 --> 00:28:01.550
off the beaten trail, snowshoe
up or mountain bike up.

00:28:01.550 --> 00:28:05.820
And it becomes more
unique of a connection,

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:09.380
which I've found some of the
space because it's very quiet.

00:28:09.380 --> 00:28:12.470
It's very holding of
the space together.

00:28:12.470 --> 00:28:16.169
And a lot of times, what they
experienced to get to the place

00:28:16.169 --> 00:28:17.960
woken them up in a
certain way that they're

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.567
ready for a certain experience
of conversation or sharing.

00:28:20.567 --> 00:28:22.400
AUDIENCE: I just wanted
to ask, what are you

00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.230
trying in the next
10 years or 20 years?

00:28:24.230 --> 00:28:26.780
Do you find people in
snowboarding and photographing

00:28:26.780 --> 00:28:28.910
yourself or photographing
other riders?

00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:31.580
Or what do you see [INAUDIBLE]?

00:28:31.580 --> 00:28:33.240
MIKE BASICH: It's
a great question.

00:28:33.240 --> 00:28:37.610
I truly don't have the
true answer to that.

00:28:37.610 --> 00:28:39.710
I do love photography.

00:28:39.710 --> 00:28:44.570
I think, in a way, it will be a
combination of more my building

00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:49.940
world and sharing that
maybe with younger crowds.

00:28:49.940 --> 00:28:54.060
I'm about to be a father and
so my excitement to share

00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:59.060
is accelerating as a day goes
by to get ready for that.

00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:02.240
And however may be--

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:04.090
content's a great way
to share information.

00:29:04.090 --> 00:29:08.150
But I I've learned
giving talks is

00:29:08.150 --> 00:29:11.060
something I enjoy and
seem to have a closer

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:14.090
connection of
understanding how to talk

00:29:14.090 --> 00:29:16.310
to some someone
versus making a video.

00:29:16.310 --> 00:29:18.500
So I'd say more talks like this.

00:29:22.484 --> 00:29:25.780
AUDIENCE: So living off the
grid and living in the woods

00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:29.170
as such, you might have
encountered certain situations

00:29:29.170 --> 00:29:31.970
where the things
are very extreme,

00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.480
in terms of nature or
wildlife or anything.

00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:37.240
Any interesting
experience that you had?

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.740
Like, where you
felt you've not been

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:40.705
prepared for what
you were encountering

00:29:40.705 --> 00:29:43.202
at that time [INAUDIBLE]?

00:29:43.202 --> 00:29:43.910
MIKE BASICH: Yes.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:47.720
Many things I realized
I wasn't prepared.

00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:53.150
I live off the grid enough where
I can hike back to civilization

00:29:53.150 --> 00:29:54.750
within a day.

00:29:54.750 --> 00:30:00.330
And so that's my security of
not doing something right.

00:30:00.330 --> 00:30:04.310
But I I've learned a lot about
how to shop because everything

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:06.200
I do I have to get rid of--

00:30:06.200 --> 00:30:09.500
my trash, human waste.

00:30:09.500 --> 00:30:12.680
Everything you have to
deal with, carry water.

00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:15.290
Water freezing is
a huge task where

00:30:15.290 --> 00:30:17.360
I'm at because there's
a lot of rocks.

00:30:17.360 --> 00:30:21.530
I can't bury water below
freezing very easily.

00:30:21.530 --> 00:30:24.170
When I do, it's very
limited water amount.

00:30:24.170 --> 00:30:26.390
And so I've become
great appreciation

00:30:26.390 --> 00:30:30.560
in water and working
with the temperatures.

00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:32.840
I welded a lot, and
that was actually

00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.300
like a saver of welding
to keep my hands warm

00:30:35.300 --> 00:30:36.620
while I was out in the snow.

00:30:36.620 --> 00:30:39.500
AUDIENCE: You've also
mentioned at some point risk,

00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.790
taking it and handling it.

00:30:40.790 --> 00:30:43.580
I would like-- you've obviously
done lots of things that

00:30:43.580 --> 00:30:46.040
for most of us feel very risky.

00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:50.270
How have you balanced taking
risks and, well, living to be

00:30:50.270 --> 00:30:52.520
here, giving this talk today?

00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:56.300
MIKE BASICH: The level of risk
I've managed with what I know

00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.880
and also what I don't know.

00:30:58.880 --> 00:31:01.310
I don't have all the
equations figured out

00:31:01.310 --> 00:31:03.300
before something happens.

00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:08.570
And so that's a level of
risk what I'm willing to do,

00:31:08.570 --> 00:31:11.050
the one I'm willing to take.

00:31:11.050 --> 00:31:14.780
A lot of them, I try not to do
where my life is threatened.

00:31:14.780 --> 00:31:18.350
But snowboarding has taught me
how to perform under pressure

00:31:18.350 --> 00:31:19.495
because life's on the line.

00:31:19.495 --> 00:31:22.670
You screw up, you can get
seriously hurt or die.

00:31:22.670 --> 00:31:26.300
And to do that at a
multifunction of shooting

00:31:26.300 --> 00:31:29.330
remotes at the same
time, I've developed

00:31:29.330 --> 00:31:31.460
awareness of different things.

00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:34.490
So if I'm building my cabin
out in the woods on a ladder,

00:31:34.490 --> 00:31:36.650
I can feel the space.

00:31:36.650 --> 00:31:42.200
I feel a lot better and
I can manage my ability

00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:43.470
what I'm doing.

00:31:43.470 --> 00:31:46.880
The level of risk
that I enjoy taking

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:49.910
is being vulnerable,
criss-crossing

00:31:49.910 --> 00:31:52.430
the threshold of discomfort.

00:31:52.430 --> 00:31:56.360
And I do that with
athletic ability,

00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:00.200
but I like also doing that in a
way of just taking on something

00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:01.220
I don't know.

00:32:01.220 --> 00:32:02.730
And I did that my whole life.

00:32:02.730 --> 00:32:05.660
That's how I learned how
to do things in the world.

00:32:05.660 --> 00:32:07.450
I never went to college.

00:32:07.450 --> 00:32:10.069
I own a snowboard
outerwear company in Japan.

00:32:10.069 --> 00:32:12.110
I've dealt with all my
contracts in snowboarding,

00:32:12.110 --> 00:32:13.520
never had an agent.

00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:17.420
And so I've just taken on
things where the level of risk

00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:20.570
feels high, but I'm
willing to fail.

00:32:20.570 --> 00:32:24.230
And that's one of my key
understandings on risk.

00:32:24.230 --> 00:32:27.770
If you're willing to
fail, you can always

00:32:27.770 --> 00:32:31.700
gain something from it because
I've failed many times.

00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:32.940
I always do.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:35.270
It's something that
I'm expected to do.

00:32:35.270 --> 00:32:38.160
And people forget
that, I realize,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.830
especially when I
get someone coming

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:41.670
wanting to build a tiny home.

00:32:41.670 --> 00:32:44.160
They have these prints
of, like, all these plans

00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.221
they've been planning
out for years

00:32:46.221 --> 00:32:47.720
and they've never
picked up a hammer

00:32:47.720 --> 00:32:51.200
yet because they're scared
something's going to go wrong.

00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.500
And I try to encourage
people the level of risk,

00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.280
of it being known as failure.

00:32:58.280 --> 00:33:00.670
It's kind of like,
give it a shot.

00:33:00.670 --> 00:33:03.260
If you need to do
it on a small level,

00:33:03.260 --> 00:33:06.470
do that, and just learn
from the failing process

00:33:06.470 --> 00:33:08.332
because those have the answers.

00:33:08.332 --> 00:33:10.790
And it's not going to be an
answer that you're looking for.

00:33:10.790 --> 00:33:13.420
It's going to be something
that you're not expecting.

00:33:13.420 --> 00:33:15.211
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
ask you of the moment

00:33:15.211 --> 00:33:16.937
when you jump up to
the helicopter, what

00:33:16.937 --> 00:33:18.770
do you think that
[INAUDIBLE] more concerned

00:33:18.770 --> 00:33:19.970
about the jump itself?

00:33:19.970 --> 00:33:21.360
Or maybe about the picture?

00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:22.870
Or [INAUDIBLE]?

00:33:25.644 --> 00:33:27.310
MIKE BASICH: That
photo, the helicopter,

00:33:27.310 --> 00:33:29.570
was a unique one for me.

00:33:29.570 --> 00:33:32.620
My biggest issue at the
moment before I jumped

00:33:32.620 --> 00:33:36.280
was a down pressure of the
blades of the helicopter.

00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.580
So I actually got going
faster than gravity.

00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:42.370
I could barely lift my
board off this skid.

00:33:42.370 --> 00:33:44.080
I just kind of slid off.

00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:47.570
And around that time, I totally
forgot about the remote,

00:33:47.570 --> 00:33:49.840
that I was shooting photos.

00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:52.570
And there's a
certain process when

00:33:52.570 --> 00:33:55.420
that's happened because
when I grab my snowboard,

00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:58.730
the other hand naturally
wants to do the same.

00:33:58.730 --> 00:34:00.720
And so I had no idea
if I took the photo.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:02.790
This is back in the
slide film days,

00:34:02.790 --> 00:34:06.649
so I just knew the camera
took the whole roll.

00:34:06.649 --> 00:34:08.440
And I was lucky enough
to get a photo of it

00:34:08.440 --> 00:34:11.139
because I put
myself in a position

00:34:11.139 --> 00:34:13.420
where I didn't want the
pressure from other film

00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:14.590
and photographers.

00:34:14.590 --> 00:34:17.620
So I was the only one
there taking a photo.

00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:22.760
And it became larger than
I thought it would be.

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:25.810
But in the perspective of
being on the top looking down,

00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:29.440
it was something I felt. I
waited while until I felt

00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:32.920
that zone like clarity, like
this is what we want to do

00:34:32.920 --> 00:34:33.736
and I see it.

00:34:33.736 --> 00:34:34.610
It's going to happen.

00:34:34.610 --> 00:34:35.464
And here I go.

00:34:35.464 --> 00:34:36.880
AUDIENCE: So in a
way, you've been

00:34:36.880 --> 00:34:40.449
a pioneer of marrying
the sport and photography

00:34:40.449 --> 00:34:43.070
that you did when you started.

00:34:43.070 --> 00:34:46.270
So you've seen as far as some
sort of unexplored territory

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:49.050
that not a lot of
riders are looking into.

00:34:49.050 --> 00:34:51.580
Like, in a way,
you are 25 or 30,

00:34:51.580 --> 00:34:54.230
right, when you starting doing
this personal photography?

00:34:54.230 --> 00:34:57.550
What is the creative,
unexplored territory today

00:34:57.550 --> 00:35:00.910
that you would have done
if you had to be completely

00:35:00.910 --> 00:35:03.130
creative [INAUDIBLE]?

00:35:03.130 --> 00:35:04.630
MIKE BASICH: I think
the key element

00:35:04.630 --> 00:35:07.810
to that is knowing less.

00:35:07.810 --> 00:35:11.390
I was able to shoot
cameras in a way

00:35:11.390 --> 00:35:13.780
because I didn't know
anything about them.

00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.790
And so I kind of twisted
the rules a little bit

00:35:16.790 --> 00:35:19.690
because I wasn't taught.

00:35:19.690 --> 00:35:22.790
I just kind of took
it in a raw space.

00:35:22.790 --> 00:35:27.725
And so I think it's important
to learn about things.

00:35:27.725 --> 00:35:30.350
And what I've learned, if you're
going to learn about something

00:35:30.350 --> 00:35:32.410
and want to be in a
new space with it,

00:35:32.410 --> 00:35:35.980
creative-wise and
innovative-wise,

00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:38.680
is to go back to
that discomfort,

00:35:38.680 --> 00:35:41.230
crossing the threshold,
letting go of everything

00:35:41.230 --> 00:35:45.220
you know, and just kind
of like take a risk

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.020
on putting something
together that

00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:49.270
has a lot to do with
timing and where

00:35:49.270 --> 00:35:51.400
technology is at the moment.

00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:55.450
Because what's happened with me
is technology met some ideas.

00:35:55.450 --> 00:35:58.610
Some took 10 years,
some took weeks.

00:35:58.610 --> 00:36:01.240
But they all kind of
were a moment in time

00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.400
that wasn't together yet.

00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:05.260
And I look outside
of snowboarding

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:10.090
a lot, outside of photography a
lot, at different technologies.

00:36:10.090 --> 00:36:12.910
The drone world-- soon as
I saw something happen,

00:36:12.910 --> 00:36:16.430
I realized I don't need
a paraglider anymore.

00:36:16.430 --> 00:36:20.290
I don't know how a camera's
going to mount on a drone yet,

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:24.100
because they're too heavy,
but four or five years later,

00:36:24.100 --> 00:36:26.060
it finally happened.

00:36:26.060 --> 00:36:27.790
And so that's kind
of in a simple way

00:36:27.790 --> 00:36:30.490
of a different equation
from different industries

00:36:30.490 --> 00:36:33.420
coming together to do
something together.

00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:35.890
SPEAKER 1: I guess I have a
few more questions as well.

00:36:35.890 --> 00:36:37.829
One of the questions
is where Google--

00:36:37.829 --> 00:36:38.620
I work for YouTube.

00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:40.990
I'm an engineer on YouTube.

00:36:40.990 --> 00:36:45.850
What's going on with your
YouTube channel right now?

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:47.440
MIKE BASICH: Not much.

00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:50.950
I, for some reason,
don't spend a lot of time

00:36:50.950 --> 00:36:52.720
on my YouTube channel.

00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:56.140
I don't know if it's because
I'm unfamiliar with it.

00:36:56.140 --> 00:37:00.460
I probably blame some of that
on the edits that come out.

00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.860
I've handed over the
footage to someone else

00:37:02.860 --> 00:37:06.820
and they keep their edits
on their YouTube channels.

00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:11.020
And so that's kind
of what I've learned

00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:12.430
a little bit in my photography.

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:14.380
I've sat down and
edited my own things,

00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:18.010
but I have more coverage, more
marketability if I hand it

00:37:18.010 --> 00:37:21.760
over to somebody and they can
do something else with it.

00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:24.640
And so I don't have a lot of
control over all the videos

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:27.130
to put on my
YouTube is one part.

00:37:27.130 --> 00:37:30.147
SPEAKER 1: Do you edit all
of your own content as well?

00:37:30.147 --> 00:37:31.480
MIKE BASICH: I do on some level.

00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:37.080
I used to do it a lot, but
it's the quality, everything--

00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:38.360
I'm on the road so much.

00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:41.290
I can only do so
much with my laptop.

00:37:41.290 --> 00:37:44.320
Everything else is too
much for me to handle,

00:37:44.320 --> 00:37:46.240
so I usually just
hand things off

00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:47.923
because I'm bouncing
around a lot.

00:37:47.923 --> 00:37:48.770
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:37:48.770 --> 00:37:52.120
That's the easy way to do it.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:55.217
What awesome technologies
are you kind of looking for,

00:37:55.217 --> 00:37:56.800
that you've seen in
the news or you've

00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:58.591
seen other companies
working on that you're

00:37:58.591 --> 00:38:02.090
really excited about that
might influence your work?

00:38:02.090 --> 00:38:08.400
MIKE BASICH: Oh, I'm not
totally pinpointed on,

00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.260
like, the circle camera.

00:38:10.260 --> 00:38:15.090
I've seen that get invaded
into a little ball now.

00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.949
So I'm kind of curious on
where that perspective goes.

00:38:18.949 --> 00:38:21.240
Sometimes I worry that it's
getting farther and farther

00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:24.130
away from us
learning how to feel

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:28.170
the experience, that there's a
bigger gap in the actual action

00:38:28.170 --> 00:38:30.910
part of the self doing it.

00:38:30.910 --> 00:38:35.610
And so that's one thing that
when you look at a screen,

00:38:35.610 --> 00:38:37.719
I get a little worried if
the kids watching this,

00:38:37.719 --> 00:38:39.510
that they're going to
actually go and do it

00:38:39.510 --> 00:38:40.895
or if that's just enough.

00:38:40.895 --> 00:38:41.520
SPEAKER 1: Yeah

00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:42.686
MIKE BASICH: Because we're--

00:38:42.686 --> 00:38:45.390
technology-wise, it's
becoming more and more real,

00:38:45.390 --> 00:38:47.220
like that you're actually there.

00:38:47.220 --> 00:38:48.470
And that's making.

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:52.110
I think, the younger
generation just--

00:38:52.110 --> 00:38:53.820
that's cool, that's it.

00:38:53.820 --> 00:38:56.020
They don't have the
desire to go do it.

00:38:56.020 --> 00:38:59.060
So I'm hoping somewhere
in the mix of technology

00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:02.040
in days to come,
that it'll bring

00:39:02.040 --> 00:39:06.490
us into a more of a
feeling it ourselves.

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:10.930
SPEAKER 1: Do you kind of look
at VR as an extension of that?

00:39:10.930 --> 00:39:14.510
So it'll make kids
passive and accepting of,

00:39:14.510 --> 00:39:17.470
oh, I did it in VR, so I don't
need to do it in real life.

00:39:17.470 --> 00:39:20.100
MIKE BASICH: I-- no.

00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:21.990
I don't.

00:39:21.990 --> 00:39:26.160
What I do see it doing is being
a teaching-- if somebody wants

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.350
to learn how to do
a trick, I think

00:39:28.350 --> 00:39:30.210
it could help them
visualize what

00:39:30.210 --> 00:39:32.090
it is to do a double backflip.

00:39:32.090 --> 00:39:34.170
So they get to see something.

00:39:34.170 --> 00:39:37.290
But the simpleness of just,
say, snowboarding, just

00:39:37.290 --> 00:39:41.020
going down a hill, I
think, does the opposite.

00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.130
It brings a person farther
away from doing a sport.

00:39:44.130 --> 00:39:49.590
And I've learned-- my niece
actually has scoliosis

00:39:49.590 --> 00:39:53.070
and she's doing some
major exercises that

00:39:53.070 --> 00:39:54.360
are very painful.

00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.270
And the VR has
actually been very pain

00:39:57.270 --> 00:40:01.530
relieving because it makes your
mind disconnect from your body

00:40:01.530 --> 00:40:04.440
on some level because you're
in this other world, of course.

00:40:04.440 --> 00:40:06.650
That's kind of the idea.

00:40:06.650 --> 00:40:10.080
So I see a huge
outlet for people

00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:13.530
to be released from
struggles or just

00:40:13.530 --> 00:40:17.250
taking a break from life or
gain through a certain exercise

00:40:17.250 --> 00:40:19.925
and getting progressive with.

00:40:19.925 --> 00:40:21.300
SPEAKER 1: So what
happens if you

00:40:21.300 --> 00:40:24.920
were to use VR when you're
living off the grid?

00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.820
MIKE BASICH: Oh, I
had someone come out

00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:30.600
and we filmed the full VR video.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:33.030
And for me, it's a
little-- it's hard

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.940
because I'm there all the
time, then I watch something

00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:37.539
and it's different.

00:40:37.539 --> 00:40:40.080
You feel like you didn't get to
tell the whole story that you

00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:41.110
wanted to tell.

00:40:41.110 --> 00:40:43.290
And this has happened
in my whole career.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:46.440
People take their own stories
on when they see a certain image

00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:48.240
or video.

00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:55.710
And the VR, I think, is it's
a three dimension, gives you

00:40:55.710 --> 00:40:59.310
something back to
losing yourself,

00:40:59.310 --> 00:41:00.810
which I think is a plus.

00:41:00.810 --> 00:41:03.060
But too much, I wonder.

00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.570
Like, it's less
being in the world.

00:41:06.570 --> 00:41:09.120
In some ways, we're
creating a world.

00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.000
So I kind of--

00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:11.570
I don't know.

00:41:11.570 --> 00:41:14.310
I challenge you on
where we're going

00:41:14.310 --> 00:41:16.710
to go with that
because in some ways,

00:41:16.710 --> 00:41:19.770
we're all responsible
for what happens.

00:41:19.770 --> 00:41:23.500
Each generation is
born into groundwork.

00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.830
And so the next
generation is going

00:41:25.830 --> 00:41:30.270
to think VR is just the
standard, which it probably

00:41:30.270 --> 00:41:32.370
will become a standard.

00:41:32.370 --> 00:41:35.370
But no one's really, as
generation comes on, they never

00:41:35.370 --> 00:41:38.450
ask, could we do it different?

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:41.520
They're just kind of
like, it's already set.

00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.800
Progress with it,
but maybe there's

00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:46.400
a moment where someone
should have said, no.

00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.900
If you're going to
do this, you need

00:41:47.900 --> 00:41:49.691
to at least go outside
and stick your hands

00:41:49.691 --> 00:41:51.179
in the dirt for five minutes.

00:41:51.179 --> 00:41:52.470
Just remember that you're here.

00:41:52.470 --> 00:41:54.840
SPEAKER 1: Switching gears,
I wanted to ask about this.

00:41:54.840 --> 00:41:57.100
So you didn't go
over this at all,

00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:59.060
but you build your
own ski lift, right?

00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.710
Like, on your property, out
in the middle of nowhere,

00:42:01.710 --> 00:42:03.280
with your hands.

00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:05.200
Can you talk a little
bit about that?

00:42:05.200 --> 00:42:06.570
MIKE BASICH: Yeah.

00:42:06.570 --> 00:42:12.200
That pushed my
engineering ability a lot.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:15.270
Yeah I came across this
old chairlift from Sweden.

00:42:15.270 --> 00:42:16.260
It was in pieces.

00:42:16.260 --> 00:42:19.020
And I had a tow rope for
years at my property,

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:21.540
so I was like, oh, this is
perfect, to get off the ground

00:42:21.540 --> 00:42:23.690
and bury anything.

00:42:23.690 --> 00:42:28.350
And it wasn't so
much of something

00:42:28.350 --> 00:42:32.880
I had a long-term goal of,
but I love progressing.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.100
My mind is always busy so
I'm trying to find a place

00:42:35.100 --> 00:42:37.140
to put it to action.

00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.500
So this was something that
got me an understanding of how

00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:44.220
the engineering of physics
work because I am not

00:42:44.220 --> 00:42:45.450
very good at schooling.

00:42:45.450 --> 00:42:49.020
I'm just great on
hand and back to I

00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:53.410
was willing to take the risk of
whatever this was going to be.

00:42:53.410 --> 00:42:54.690
And I learned a lot.

00:42:54.690 --> 00:42:59.520
It's fascinating, engineering
of what happens on a chairlift.

00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:04.039
300 pounds becomes 12,000
pounds within seconds.

00:43:04.039 --> 00:43:05.580
SPEAKER 1: But you
were never worried

00:43:05.580 --> 00:43:08.164
that you were going to fall off
or it was going to break or--

00:43:08.164 --> 00:43:09.080
MIKE BASICH: Oh, yeah.

00:43:09.080 --> 00:43:09.746
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:43:09.746 --> 00:43:11.790
MIKE BASICH: Yeah.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:14.730
SPEAKER 1: I guess the drop
was less than the 30 meters

00:43:14.730 --> 00:43:15.720
from the helicopter.

00:43:15.720 --> 00:43:18.095
MIKE BASICH: Yeah, it was
rocks, so it's a little harder.

00:43:18.095 --> 00:43:21.510
But I had a bunch
of friends help out.

00:43:21.510 --> 00:43:24.157
And some never came
back, some stuck

00:43:24.157 --> 00:43:25.240
through the whole process.

00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:26.820
Took about eight months.

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.100
And I didn't have
any fancy equipment,

00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:33.930
so a lot of cowboy just putting
ropes up the trees with winches

00:43:33.930 --> 00:43:37.380
because we lifted six towers.

00:43:37.380 --> 00:43:40.620
And drawing a straight line
in mid air up the mountain

00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:43.692
is pretty challenging to
figure out how to do that.

00:43:43.692 --> 00:43:44.400
SPEAKER 1: Right.

00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.830
MIKE BASICH: So it was fun
working with old school

00:43:46.830 --> 00:43:50.490
equipment and
figuring that all out.

00:43:50.490 --> 00:43:53.080
SPEAKER 1: I'm kind of curious
about your shopping habits.

00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.960
This is weird
question, but so you

00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:57.930
said you think a lot
about what you're

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:01.560
going to buy before you bring
it back home because there's

00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:05.100
effort involved in both
bringing it there and taking

00:44:05.100 --> 00:44:06.411
the rubbish away.

00:44:06.411 --> 00:44:07.410
MIKE BASICH: Yeah, yeah.

00:44:07.410 --> 00:44:08.820
I've learned paper--

00:44:08.820 --> 00:44:12.330
I have fire as my hot
water heating source.

00:44:12.330 --> 00:44:15.230
So anything I could
burn, I burn it.

00:44:15.230 --> 00:44:18.880
I've learned the amount of
fuel to recycle certain things,

00:44:18.880 --> 00:44:20.430
it's better just to burn it.

00:44:20.430 --> 00:44:23.250
So I don't burn everything.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:27.900
There's some things I come back
and recycle when I can in town,

00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:31.700
but it's a lot
[INAUDIBLE] due to weight.

00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.770
Sometimes I'm hiking,
the whole hike up I

00:44:34.770 --> 00:44:37.194
have a snowmobile or a snowcat.

00:44:37.194 --> 00:44:38.610
Depending on the
snow conditions I

00:44:38.610 --> 00:44:41.220
can drive a snowcat to my door.

00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:43.400
I mean, it takes a half hour.

00:44:43.400 --> 00:44:46.140
But if I don't have that
option, which the weather always

00:44:46.140 --> 00:44:48.330
kind of predicts whether
I can do that or not.

00:44:48.330 --> 00:44:51.615
So I try just to plan like,
kind of like you're camping

00:44:51.615 --> 00:44:55.840
in some form, efficient, smart.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:59.610
Don't over-shop
for wasting stuff.

00:44:59.610 --> 00:45:01.950
SPEAKER 1: So sustainability
is a big aspect

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.040
of most of your shopping trips.

00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040
MIKE BASICH: Yeah, yeah.

00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:06.966
And it's also
vegetables last longer

00:45:06.966 --> 00:45:08.340
and meat in certain
temperatures.

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:13.120
I'm like, OK, I'm a vegetarian
for the next four months.

00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:14.370
Yeah, so I try to move around.

00:45:14.370 --> 00:45:17.220
And I travel a
lot, so I'm moving.

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.860
I'm trying to be OK
with the traveling, too.

00:45:19.860 --> 00:45:22.290
It's like back to knowing more.

00:45:22.290 --> 00:45:25.490
It's hard to figure out
where to place yourself.

00:45:25.490 --> 00:45:31.350
I'm learning as we go and trying
to be with you all with that.

00:45:31.350 --> 00:45:33.570
SPEAKER 1: That's cool.

00:45:33.570 --> 00:45:37.670
If anybody else those
questions, always feel free.

00:45:37.670 --> 00:45:39.840
SPEAKER 2: We have
questions on the Dory.

00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:41.440
SPEAKER 1: Oh, there's a Dory.

00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:43.690
SPEAKER 2: Is there
any possible shot

00:45:43.690 --> 00:45:47.525
that was actually
impossible and was given up.

00:45:47.525 --> 00:45:49.850
If so, any plans
to get that sooner

00:45:49.850 --> 00:45:52.094
with better technology now?

00:45:52.094 --> 00:45:53.760
MIKE BASICH: Oh, to
do something better.

00:45:59.250 --> 00:46:02.760
I must say my brain
has slowed down

00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.960
after so many years of
taking self portraits.

00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:10.620
But there's Follow Cam.

00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.040
I love working with
pilots for drone pilots.

00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:17.590
And one of the fascinating
parts about drones--

00:46:17.590 --> 00:46:21.180
is I guess it's not exactly
about the photography part,

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:26.640
but I can put on VR goggles and
I can watch the drone go down

00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:28.920
my line, say, in Alaska
because a lot of time,

00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.830
you can't see what you're
going down, it's so steep.

00:46:31.830 --> 00:46:33.510
And there might
be three chutes--

00:46:33.510 --> 00:46:36.680
two of them cliff out, the other
one you're supposed to go down.

00:46:36.680 --> 00:46:39.310
But it all looks different
when you get to the top.

00:46:39.310 --> 00:46:42.780
And so I feel like that
would advance photography

00:46:42.780 --> 00:46:45.960
and the athlete because
they're more confident,

00:46:45.960 --> 00:46:48.150
they can perform
better, and you'll

00:46:48.150 --> 00:46:51.840
end up with something
more technical as a shot,

00:46:51.840 --> 00:46:55.360
which can bring more beauty
or new space to work with.

00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:58.980
SPEAKER 1: So not only advances
to take the shot, but just

00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:01.570
your ability to go
down the mountain.

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:02.530
MIKE BASICH: Yeah.

00:47:02.530 --> 00:47:03.030
Yeah.

00:47:03.030 --> 00:47:06.330
I mean, I would love to be able
to make a drone go away from me

00:47:06.330 --> 00:47:09.120
and come back as I'm
moving down the mountain,

00:47:09.120 --> 00:47:11.910
if I can be that
close to something.

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:13.770
So far, I just know
one pilot that's

00:47:13.770 --> 00:47:16.230
willing to do it with me.

00:47:16.230 --> 00:47:19.860
But it's the part of
that's kind of what happens

00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.240
when you're snowboarding.

00:47:21.240 --> 00:47:23.490
You're very in your
space, but then you're

00:47:23.490 --> 00:47:27.040
also going back to looking
100 feet ahead of you.

00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:29.700
So your mind's going in and out
of your body in some ways, just

00:47:29.700 --> 00:47:31.380
to be aware.

00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:33.780
And so if you can make a
camera do that, that's--

00:47:33.780 --> 00:47:36.090
I feel that would be
another space to work with.

00:47:36.090 --> 00:47:37.964
SPEAKER 1: What was your
most terrifying line

00:47:37.964 --> 00:47:39.260
that you've ran?

00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:45.240
MIKE BASICH: There's one,
actually, it was a remote

00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:48.060
and the hill slid.

00:47:48.060 --> 00:47:51.030
And I remember being on
top of a double cliff.

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:52.490
And I went off the first cliff.

00:47:52.490 --> 00:47:55.080
It was in an avalanche
and I couldn't see,

00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:56.990
but I remember
halfway in the air,

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.400
like, if I stay
in this position,

00:47:59.400 --> 00:48:01.240
I'm going to land on
my back on the rock.

00:48:01.240 --> 00:48:03.300
That was my most odds.

00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:06.000
And last second,
I rotated as much

00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.010
as I could and I hit
my hip on the rock

00:48:08.010 --> 00:48:10.590
instead of directly in the back.

00:48:10.590 --> 00:48:11.880
Put me out for months.

00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:15.640
But that was kind of
my scariest moment,

00:48:15.640 --> 00:48:19.670
like the moment of thinking
that something's going

00:48:19.670 --> 00:48:21.295
to happen to me permanently.

00:48:21.295 --> 00:48:26.430
The heaviness got a quick
response or the best I could.

00:48:26.430 --> 00:48:29.359
SPEAKER 1: Spider sense.

00:48:29.359 --> 00:48:30.900
Do we have anything
else on the Dory?

00:48:30.900 --> 00:48:32.460
Sorry.

00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:33.990
SPEAKER 2: Yeah.

00:48:33.990 --> 00:48:35.816
One more, actually.

00:48:35.816 --> 00:48:38.360
Also from [INAUDIBLE],,
you have a big fan here.

00:48:40.890 --> 00:48:44.280
What do you think about
those full-time Instagram

00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.340
snowboarders?

00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:46.540
Here's an example--

00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:50.852
Jerome [INAUDIBLE] Snowboarding.

00:48:50.852 --> 00:48:52.560
There's a YouTube
link, but I don't think

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:54.620
we can play it in the--

00:48:54.620 --> 00:48:56.820
so it's basically,
what do you think

00:48:56.820 --> 00:48:59.834
about those full-time
Instagram snowboarders?

00:48:59.834 --> 00:49:00.750
MIKE BASICH: I think--

00:49:00.750 --> 00:49:01.660
SPEAKER 2: I have more details.

00:49:01.660 --> 00:49:02.660
MIKE BASICH: Yeah, yeah.

00:49:02.660 --> 00:49:05.130
Well, I'll grab
onto some ideas here

00:49:05.130 --> 00:49:07.680
of what I've learned
in snowboarding,

00:49:07.680 --> 00:49:11.310
say, on the athlete side is
snowboarding progressed so much

00:49:11.310 --> 00:49:14.340
with what people are doing in
competitions and in the latest

00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:18.660
videos that it's so much that
the consumer actually doesn't

00:49:18.660 --> 00:49:20.410
want to be the person anymore.

00:49:20.410 --> 00:49:21.880
It looks too hard.

00:49:21.880 --> 00:49:24.460
It looks out of reach.

00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:28.620
And so what I've learned
sharing more of a lifestyle,

00:49:28.620 --> 00:49:29.570
whatever that is.

00:49:29.570 --> 00:49:32.310
Mine's off the grid.

00:49:32.310 --> 00:49:34.440
People feel more
connected. it just feels

00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:37.080
more real backyard feeling.

00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.930
And so I feel like
there's a more marketing

00:49:39.930 --> 00:49:41.500
tool within that.

00:49:41.500 --> 00:49:45.040
And in snowboarding, it
hasn't always been there.

00:49:45.040 --> 00:49:47.250
It's been actually very
challenging to beat

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:51.780
the 18-year-old out of the
seat to be in the market seat.

00:49:51.780 --> 00:49:54.540
But I feel like that's actually
what's naturally happening now,

00:49:54.540 --> 00:49:56.610
just people are--

00:49:56.610 --> 00:49:58.980
they watch the Olympics
and it's cool to watch.

00:49:58.980 --> 00:50:00.220
It's awesome.

00:50:00.220 --> 00:50:02.670
But a lot of people like, no.

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:03.820
I just want to go have fun.

00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:05.916
And that's kind of
the basics of why

00:50:05.916 --> 00:50:07.290
a lot of us got
into snowboarding

00:50:07.290 --> 00:50:09.500
was just for pure fun.

00:50:09.500 --> 00:50:13.650
And there's the competitive
side and it's progressed a lot,

00:50:13.650 --> 00:50:15.900
but the heart of
just pure fun is,

00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:18.750
I think, the main
seat of snowboarding.

00:50:18.750 --> 00:50:19.770
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:50:19.770 --> 00:50:21.880
I agree with that.

00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:24.150
We're going to hear
the music soon.

00:50:24.150 --> 00:50:27.540
So anyways, I want to thank you
for coming and talking with us

00:50:27.540 --> 00:50:28.090
today.

00:50:28.090 --> 00:50:31.570
It's been awesome to hear
your life and experiences.

00:50:31.570 --> 00:50:33.021
MIKE BASICH: Thanks
for having me.

00:50:33.021 --> 00:50:34.020
Thank you for your time.

00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:34.620
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:50:34.620 --> 00:50:35.453
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:35.453 --> 00:50:37.970
[APPLAUSE]
