00:00:00.789 --> 00:00:03.070
&gt;&gt;Winnie Lam: Hello everyone, thank you so
much for coming.

00:00:03.070 --> 00:00:09.190
I'm Winnie Lam and it is my absolute pleasure
to welcome our speakers today, Jenny Ross

00:00:09.190 --> 00:00:15.080
and Kassie Siegel who is at the back there
with a big polar bear [laughs].

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:17.330
So let me introduce our speakers.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.670
Jenny Ross is an award winning photographer.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:26.880
She has won many, many photography awards
specializing in wildlife and conservation.

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:32.329
Her most recent award is the World Press Photo
Award which is kinda like the Oscars for photo

00:00:32.329 --> 00:00:34.820
journalism, so it was a really big deal.

00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:41.020
Her photographs have been exhibited at the
local California Academy of Sciences and at

00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:44.640
the Smithsonian National Museum of Natural
History.

00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.410
Our former President, Bill Clinton, also has
her photographs in his private collection,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:52.020
so that's really cool.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:58.050
Kassie Siegel is the director of the Climate
Law Institute at the Center for Biological

00:00:58.050 --> 00:00:59.510
Diversity.

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:04.489
She sought to protect the polar bear by listing
it as an endangered species under the Endangered

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:06.330
Species Act.

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:14.040
Prior to her becoming a lawyer at the Berkeley
Law School she was leading trips in Alaska

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:15.810
for Natural History.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:20.909
So without further ado let's give a very warm
welcome to our guests today, Jenny Ross and

00:01:20.909 --> 00:01:22.570
Kassie Siegel.

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:23.950
[applause]

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:33.890
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: Hi everybody, I appreciate your
being here today.

00:01:33.890 --> 00:01:39.770
It's really a pleasure and an honor to have
the opportunity to speak with you and to share

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:41.479
some of my photographs with you.

00:01:41.479 --> 00:01:47.700
Kassie and I are going to try to cover quite
a bit of ground in a short amount of time

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:54.700
today, so if you have questions as we go along
please do try to remember your questions and

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.659
then when we're finished we'll try to answer
them for you.

00:01:58.659 --> 00:02:03.479
So have any of you ever seen a wild polar
bear in its natural habitat?

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:05.790
Oh a couple people.

00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:07.990
Fantastic, excellent.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:14.290
Well I hope that the rest of you do get that
opportunity someday, it's truly an amazing

00:02:14.290 --> 00:02:18.170
experience.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:25.359
About 12 years ago I saw and photographed
polar bears for the first time in the wild

00:02:25.359 --> 00:02:33.129
and of course I was absolutely captivated
by how magnificent looking they are, but I

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:41.489
was also fascinated by how they managed to
live seemingly comfortably in such an extreme

00:02:41.489 --> 00:02:46.499
and really totally alien world of ice.

00:02:46.499 --> 00:02:55.419
Their ability to thrive in one of the harshest
environments on earth is truly awe inspiring.

00:02:55.419 --> 00:03:02.699
So at this point I've spent literally thousands
of hours in the Arctic in various regions

00:03:02.699 --> 00:03:10.279
and I've photographed polar bears throughout
the Arctic in all five of the Arctic countries.

00:03:10.279 --> 00:03:20.260
In addition I've had the privilege of working
with and, so I've also had the privilege of

00:03:20.260 --> 00:03:28.249
working with and learning from many of the
world's foremost experts on polar bear biology

00:03:28.249 --> 00:03:37.349
as well as experts on a variety of other subjects
relating to the Arctic and to climate change.

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:43.700
So in addition to talking a bit about photography
with you I'd like share some of the knowledge

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:51.959
that I've gained over the years particularly
regarding polar bear biology, ecology, and

00:03:51.959 --> 00:03:53.060
behavior.

00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.099
In addition I'd like to discuss some issues
that I feel are extremely important, really

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:06.870
crucial actually, concerning the impacts of
climate change in the Arctic.

00:04:06.870 --> 00:04:13.469
But first I'd like to tell you some things
about my photography of polar bears.

00:04:13.469 --> 00:04:22.970
For me understanding the science relating
to these truly marvelous animals has not diminished

00:04:22.970 --> 00:04:30.600
in the least that feeling of being completely
awe struck that I had when I first photographed

00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:32.540
a wild polar bear.

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:39.250
In fact, on the contrary, the more I've learned
about polar bears the more fascinating and

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.110
awe inspiring they've actually become for
me.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:49.270
So in my photography of polar bears I'm not
just trying to capture beautiful images of

00:04:49.270 --> 00:04:56.040
beautiful animals, certainly of course I am
trying to achieve that goal, but I'm really

00:04:56.040 --> 00:04:59.750
trying to do more than that, much more than
that.

00:04:59.750 --> 00:05:08.330
In my images I'm trying to explain the many
things about these remarkable animals that

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:17.900
make them exceptional and endlessly intriguing
and worthy of our respect and our admiration

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:23.680
and of course worthy of our protection as
well.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:32.210
In addition I want my photographs to communicate
that every bear is a unique individual just

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:35.090
like every one of us.

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:43.030
Human beings have a rather unfortunate tendency
to think of animals essentially as objects

00:05:43.030 --> 00:05:50.950
and as fungible, a bear is a bear is a bear,
rather than as unique individuals.

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:59.250
But the reality is that every polar bear has
his or her own unique life history and experiences

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.310
and distinctive personality.

00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:09.020
So I want people to understand what makes
them tick, how they live their lives on a

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:18.920
day to day basis, and how they manage to not
only survive but to thrive in what is truly

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:23.240
one of the most incredibly harsh places on
the planet.

00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.520
[pause]

00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:32.300
I also feel that it's essential to communicate
in a way that the average non-scientist will

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:41.310
really understand clearly and appreciate at
a gut level that polar bears are truly threatened

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:48.810
fundamentally by disappearing Arctic sea ice
as the result of rising temperatures and that

00:06:48.810 --> 00:06:51.810
the situation is getting worse.

00:06:51.810 --> 00:06:52.810
[pause]

00:06:52.810 --> 00:07:01.950
I believe that photography can be a very powerful
tool for educating people about issues as

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:09.750
to which they would otherwise have no frame
of reference, and they can also be a very

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:18.889
effective tool for inspiring people to have
both an intellectual and an emotional connection

00:07:18.889 --> 00:07:26.840
to a subject matter which motivates them to
care about the issues involved.

00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:35.780
So my ongoing long term project called Life
On Thin Ice focuses on using photography combined

00:07:35.780 --> 00:07:43.680
with science to communicate with the public
and with policy makers about climate change

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:53.700
in the Arctic, about Arctic science issues,
to explain what's happening, and to explain

00:07:53.700 --> 00:07:58.340
really why it's crucially important.

00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:07.010
So what exactly is happening in the Arctic
and just as importantly why should it really

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.490
make a difference to you?

00:08:10.490 --> 00:08:17.770
Well to put the matter simply the Arctic really
is ground zero for climate change and it's

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:28.140
undergoing a rapid, dramatic, and frankly
ominous transformation that has very serious

00:08:28.140 --> 00:08:32.560
implications for our entire planet.

00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:39.229
And in briefly explaining that to you today
I'm gonna focus specifically on polar bears

00:08:39.229 --> 00:08:46.360
because they truly are the proverbial canaries
in the coal mine with regard to climate change.

00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:54.519
So I'd like to start by discussing some key
misconceptions regarding polar bears because

00:08:54.519 --> 00:09:01.350
there are several that are very prevalent
and I think that they cause most people to

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:09.069
believe incorrectly that rising Arctic temperatures
and the disappearance of Arctic sea ice are

00:09:09.069 --> 00:09:18.600
really not a huge problem for polar bears,
when in reality those issues actually endanger

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:23.639
the continued existence of polar bears.

00:09:23.639 --> 00:09:31.970
So misconception number one: polar bears exist
in a single, large population and all of the

00:09:31.970 --> 00:09:37.930
bears essentially wander throughout the entire
Circumpolar Arctic.

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:45.740
Well this incorrect notion tends to lead people
to believe mistakenly that as the Arctic sea

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:53.670
ice melts and disappears in one area polar
bears can simply move to another area where

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:57.040
there's more sea ice.

00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.600
Before I explain why that's incorrect I wanna
pause just for a moment and make sure we're

00:10:01.600 --> 00:10:08.350
all on the same wave length regarding what
portion of the globe we're talking about.

00:10:08.350 --> 00:10:15.220
Take a look at this map and [chuckles] I apologize
it's not a Google Earth map, it certainly

00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:17.970
should be [chuckle].

00:10:17.970 --> 00:10:24.540
So the map shows the entire Northern Hemisphere
region surrounding the North Pole, and the

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:32.709
dotted circle you see there is the Arctic
Circle at approximately 66 degrees north.

00:10:32.709 --> 00:10:43.189
So the Arctic is typically defined as the
region north of the Arctic Circle, all around

00:10:43.189 --> 00:10:45.019
the North Pole.

00:10:45.019 --> 00:10:52.459
So regarding that first misconception about
polar bears, the scientific reality is that

00:10:52.459 --> 00:10:58.439
polar bears do not live in a single population
with all of the bears just sort of wandering

00:10:58.439 --> 00:11:04.070
throughout that entire Circumpolar Arctic
region.

00:11:04.070 --> 00:11:11.240
Instead scientists have determined that there
are actually 19 separate sub populations of

00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:18.899
polar bears in the Arctic, and each of these
19 regions represents an area where the circumscribed

00:11:18.899 --> 00:11:28.709
home ranges of numerous individual bears overlap
and are concentrated within a discreet geographic

00:11:28.709 --> 00:11:30.300
region.

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:37.459
And essentially for the most part the bears
in each of these separate regions remain in

00:11:37.459 --> 00:11:42.440
each of these separate regions throughout
their entire lives.

00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:51.680
In addition, the bears have very specific
habitat preferences within each of those 19

00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:52.680
areas.

00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:59.440
The range of polar bears is limited to places
where the ocean is covered with ice or nearly

00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.959
covered with ice for most of the year.

00:12:02.959 --> 00:12:08.380
And the regions where polar bears strongly
prefer to spend as much time as they possibly

00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:16.040
can are the areas where the sea ice is over
the shallow continental shelf.

00:12:16.040 --> 00:12:24.179
So on this map those shallow continental shelf
regions are designated in white and you can

00:12:24.179 --> 00:12:29.829
see that's a subset of that Circumpolar Arctic
region.

00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:36.490
So these areas designated in white are the
places where there are the highest concentrations

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:44.339
of polar bear, and that's because those are
the places where the shallow ocean has the

00:12:44.339 --> 00:12:52.749
highest degree of biological productivity,
basically where there's a complex, dense web

00:12:52.749 --> 00:12:56.129
of life in the sea.

00:12:56.129 --> 00:13:02.959
So simply put, these are the areas where polar
bears can find the highest concentrations

00:13:02.959 --> 00:13:11.410
of their prey and they can use the ice to
travel on the ocean and to hunt successfully.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:13.339
[pause]

00:13:13.339 --> 00:13:21.529
So misconception number two is that polar
bears are omnivores just like brown bears.

00:13:21.529 --> 00:13:32.899
Well the reality is that brown bears are indeed
omnivores but polar bears are obligate carnivores.

00:13:32.899 --> 00:13:38.750
This misconception tends to lead people to
believe that as the Arctic sea ice melts and

00:13:38.750 --> 00:13:45.619
disappears polar bears can simply shift from
living out on the sea ice to living on land,

00:13:45.619 --> 00:13:47.040
no problem.

00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:49.480
But that's not correct.

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:56.769
Brown bears eat a wide variety of terrestrial
foods; they eat berries and various types

00:13:56.769 --> 00:14:03.720
of vegetation, they eat insects, ground squirrels,
and of course they eat fish.

00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.199
But the diet of polar bears is completely
different and it must be completely different.

00:14:10.199 --> 00:14:18.059
It is essential for polar bears to eat a very
high fat diet consisting of blubbery marine

00:14:18.059 --> 00:14:19.769
mammals.

00:14:19.769 --> 00:14:27.649
All polar bears in all regions of the Arctic
prey on ice dependent Arctic seals.

00:14:27.649 --> 00:14:35.290
In some areas some polar bears occasionally
eat other types of big, fat marine mammals,

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:44.879
for example, walruses if an appropriate opportunity
arises, but for the most part the bottom line

00:14:44.879 --> 00:14:48.040
is that polar bears eat seals.

00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:55.360
They actually have the capacity to digest
and assimilate 97 percent of the fat that

00:14:55.360 --> 00:14:58.779
they eat which is quite remarkable.

00:14:58.779 --> 00:15:04.269
And they must have that very high fat diet.

00:15:04.269 --> 00:15:06.739
[pause]

00:15:06.739 --> 00:15:12.839
Misconception number three: as the Arctic
sea ice melts and shrinks it becomes easier

00:15:12.839 --> 00:15:19.260
for polar bears to hunt seals because they
catch their prey in the water.

00:15:19.260 --> 00:15:22.730
Well this is absolutely false.

00:15:22.730 --> 00:15:30.350
With extraordinarily rare exceptions polar
bears cannot catch their prey in the water;

00:15:30.350 --> 00:15:37.309
seals are much too quick and far too agile
when they're swimming and they can very easily

00:15:37.309 --> 00:15:40.639
evade a swimming polar bear.

00:15:40.639 --> 00:15:44.529
So how do polar bears catch seals then?

00:15:44.529 --> 00:15:51.839
Well they use a variety of very interesting
hunting techniques and unfortunately I don't

00:15:51.839 --> 00:15:56.829
have the time to tell you about those today
but you're welcome to ask me questions about

00:15:56.829 --> 00:15:58.910
that issue later.

00:15:58.910 --> 00:16:06.339
But the bottom line, the crucial issue is
that all polar bear hunting techniques rely

00:16:06.339 --> 00:16:12.009
in one way or another on the existence of
sea ice.

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:18.519
And in case you haven't spotted where the
polar bear is in this photograph he's right

00:16:18.519 --> 00:16:25.040
there in the lower right hand portion of the
frame and he's using the sea ice as camouflage

00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:29.860
as he tries to get close to a distant seal
that's lying on the ice.

00:16:29.860 --> 00:16:39.199
So regardless of the specific technique used,
polar bears absolutely must utilize sea ice

00:16:39.199 --> 00:16:43.369
in some manner in order to hunt successfully.

00:16:43.369 --> 00:16:49.939
So in an ice free ocean polar bears simply
cannot catch seals.

00:16:49.939 --> 00:16:57.069
They need the sea ice to travel long distances
and to find their prey and they need the ice

00:16:57.069 --> 00:17:05.400
to get close to seals in order to stalk them
effectively and they need the ice to actually

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.030
catch seals.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:14.040
Furthermore they need a sea ice platform in
order to feed on their prey.

00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.540
Remember they're out literally in the middle
of the ocean, they need to have that sea ice

00:17:18.540 --> 00:17:20.700
platform.

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:22.870
[pause]

00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:28.840
Misconception number four: polar bears are
good swimmers so shrinking ice cover really

00:17:28.840 --> 00:17:34.410
is not a problem for them because they can
easily travel from one area that does not

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:41.190
have ice to another area that does have ice
by swimming.

00:17:41.190 --> 00:17:47.930
Well it is true that polar bears are excellent
swimmers, they can very easily swim from one

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:54.760
ice floe to another in regions where the ice
is broken and separated by narrow channels

00:17:54.760 --> 00:17:59.000
of water such as you see here in this photograph.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:05.390
But even though polar bears can swim very
well they cannot swim indefinitely and they

00:18:05.390 --> 00:18:11.330
can have very serious problems when trying
to swim very long distances.

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:20.620
They can succumb to exhaustion and hypothermia
and they can easily drown in rough seas.

00:18:20.620 --> 00:18:28.660
In fact in regions where polar bears have
been forced recently to swim very far in rough

00:18:28.660 --> 00:18:36.300
seas because they're trying to reach that
shrinking sea ice, scientists have already

00:18:36.300 --> 00:18:43.950
documents a number of instances in which polar
bears have in fact drowned.

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:50.330
In addition it's even more difficult for cubs
to swim long distances than it is for adult

00:18:50.330 --> 00:18:51.630
bears.

00:18:51.630 --> 00:18:57.300
Cubs have substantially less body fat than
adults and that of course means they're much

00:18:57.300 --> 00:19:04.670
less well insulated so of course they get
cold much more easily and they can easily

00:19:04.670 --> 00:19:10.460
be incapacitated by hypothermia and drown.

00:19:10.460 --> 00:19:18.760
Also having less body fat means that cubs
are less buoyant so it requires a lot more

00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:25.690
energy for them to swim and they have a harder
time keeping their heads above the water,

00:19:25.690 --> 00:19:30.840
and of course that's particularly true when
the ocean is rough.

00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.530
[pause]

00:19:32.530 --> 00:19:40.600
So the crucial issue to keep in mind is that
polar bears have evolved over many tens of

00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:49.640
thousands of years to be uniquely well adapted
physically, physiologically, and behaviorally

00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:57.020
for a very specialized, extremely narrow ecological
niche in the Arctic.

00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:05.700
In fact they are so perfectly adapted to the
specific extreme conditions in the Arctic

00:20:05.700 --> 00:20:13.120
that they actually require sea ice for every
essential aspect of their lives including

00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:23.250
traveling, hunting, feeding, resting, finding
mates, and breeding.

00:20:23.250 --> 00:20:29.610
So what is happening to the Arctic sea ice
that polar bears and other Arctic animals

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:36.890
depend on that they actually must have in
order to survive?

00:20:36.890 --> 00:20:42.890
Well to put the situation bluntly it's melting
and it's disappearing.

00:20:42.890 --> 00:20:48.780
And before I explain that issue in a bit more
detail, just as a preliminary matter, I wanna

00:20:48.780 --> 00:20:54.650
be sure that you understand a couple of basic
things about Arctic sea ice.

00:20:54.650 --> 00:21:01.630
There's an annual cycle during which the Arctic
sea ice naturally grows to some extent and

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.370
then shrinks to some degree.

00:21:04.370 --> 00:21:11.180
So each year the Arctic sea ice reaches its
annual maximum extent in the late winter in

00:21:11.180 --> 00:21:18.720
approximately early March and then after the
summer melt season each year the Arctic sea

00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:26.980
ice reaches its annual minimum extent in the
fall in approximately mid-September.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:33.650
And the most important issue to keep in mind
concerning Arctic sea ice and climate change

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:41.890
is that bright ice cover on the Arctic Ocean
reflects most of the sun's radiation, whereas

00:21:41.890 --> 00:21:47.250
dark, open ocean absorbs most of the sun's
energy.

00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:53.671
So as the bright, reflective ice cover on
the ocean shrinks and more of the dark, open

00:21:53.671 --> 00:22:02.300
ocean is exposed, the sea in that region absorbs
far more of the sun's energy, the water temperature

00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:10.360
and the air temperature in that region increase,
and the remaining ice melts more and more

00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.800
quickly.

00:22:11.800 --> 00:22:17.580
And by the way the same principle applies
to disappearing snow cover and ice on dark

00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:20.250
land as well.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:25.980
So what exactly has been happening in the
Arctic to cause the sea ice to shrink?

00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:33.550
Well most crucially the concentrations of
heat trapping greenhouse gases in our atmosphere

00:22:33.550 --> 00:22:39.720
have dramatically increased and that has led
to rising temperatures.

00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:47.100
The global average temperature has been rising
since the Industrial Revolution in the 19th

00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:54.480
century, but during the last several decades
it has risen at a particularly significant

00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:55.720
rate.

00:22:55.720 --> 00:23:03.130
But importantly temperatures in the Arctic
have risen even faster than that; they've

00:23:03.130 --> 00:23:10.550
been rising at least twice as fast overall
as temperatures around the globe, the global

00:23:10.550 --> 00:23:16.580
average temperature, and in many parts of
the Arctic recently the temperatures have

00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:20.370
been rising even more dramatically than that.

00:23:20.370 --> 00:23:25.630
Take a look at this NASA color coded map and
I wanna direct your attention specifically

00:23:25.630 --> 00:23:34.570
to the upper portion of the map where there's
that huge swath of red all across the Arctic.

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:44.440
So this map shows the temperature anomalies
for all 2011 in relation to the period 1951

00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:52.560
to 1980 and as you can see in most of the
Arctic throughout 2011 temperatures were three

00:23:52.560 --> 00:24:00.260
to four and a half degrees Celsius higher
than they were just a few decades ago; that's

00:24:00.260 --> 00:24:09.380
about five and a half to eight degrees Fahrenheit
hotter in 2011, a very significant rise in

00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:11.040
temperature.

00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:17.760
So during the past few decades as a result
we have lost immense quantities of Arctic

00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.370
sea ice; there is no legitimate debate about
that fact.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:28.860
Scientific data show without a doubt that
Arctic sea ice is unquestionably shrinking

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:33.240
in both extent and in thickness.

00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:41.090
When the sea ice reached its annual minimum
extent in September of 2011 that extent was

00:24:41.090 --> 00:24:48.400
two point four three million square kilometers
smaller than the average extent that existed

00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:59.740
from 1979 through 2000, and two point four
three million square kilometers is about 935,000

00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:03.860
square miles; that's a lot of ice lost.

00:25:03.860 --> 00:25:05.310
[clears throat]

00:25:05.310 --> 00:25:12.370
In addition, the thickness of Arctic sea ice
is decreasing even more dramatically and of

00:25:12.370 --> 00:25:18.620
course the thinner the ice the most vulnerable
to further melting it becomes.

00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:25.520
The Arctic sea ice has shriveled so much in
thickness that the total volume of sea ice

00:25:25.520 --> 00:25:33.770
still remaining at the end of the melt season
in September of 2011 was nearly 70 percent

00:25:33.770 --> 00:25:40.600
less than the average volume of sea ice that
existed from 1979 to 2000.

00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.310
[pause]

00:25:42.310 --> 00:25:49.600
It's really difficult to emphasize strongly
enough how significant the recent changes

00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:52.570
in the Arctic really are.

00:25:52.570 --> 00:26:01.240
During the last 30 years as Arctic temperatures
have risen dramatically approximately 12,000

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:08.760
cubic kilometers of Arctic sea ice has completely
disappeared.

00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:14.330
Let me try to give you a sense of how much
ice that really is: imagine that the ice is

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:23.860
in a vast sheet and that sheet has a uniform
thickness of three feet; so 12,000 cubic kilometers

00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:32.860
of ice is enough ice to completely cover all
of these countries with three feet thick ice:

00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:40.380
the entire United States including Alaska
and Hawaii, Mexico, England, Ireland, France,

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:46.700
Italy, and Germany and there would still be
enough ice left over to cover New Jersey two

00:26:46.700 --> 00:26:51.700
more times with ice three feet thick.

00:26:51.700 --> 00:26:58.630
That is an enormous volume of ice and it has
completely disappeared.

00:26:58.630 --> 00:27:00.250
[pause]

00:27:00.250 --> 00:27:06.600
So what's the bottom line for the future of
Arctic sea ice and for polar bears?

00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:13.320
Well Dr. Mark Serreze who is the Director
of the U.S. National Snow and Ice Data Center

00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:20.010
recently expressed the situation this way
and I'm quoting: "It's quite conceivable that

00:27:20.010 --> 00:27:24.240
the tipping point we talk about has already
been reached.

00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:27.430
The Arctic summer sea ice is in a death spiral."

00:27:27.430 --> 00:27:30.200
[pause]

00:27:30.200 --> 00:27:37.880
Unless major action is taken very quickly
to decrease our emissions of heat trapping

00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:47.690
greenhouse gas into the atmosphere and to
slow the pace of atmospheric warming, many

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:54.030
scientists who specialize in studying Arctic
sea ice believe that there will be essentially

00:27:54.030 --> 00:28:02.340
no summer sea ice remaining within 20 years
and it's possible that most of the ice will

00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:10.560
be gone long before that, possibly as quickly
as sometime in the next 10 years.

00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:11.810
[pause[

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:13.410
Take a look at this graph for a moment.

00:28:13.410 --> 00:28:19.380
[clears throat] A number of Arctic sea ice
experts have recently determined that the

00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:26.850
data relating to Arctic sea ice volume actually
reveal an exponential decline rather than

00:28:26.850 --> 00:28:28.710
a linear decline.

00:28:28.710 --> 00:28:37.800
So as you can see if this trend continues
we may be headed for an ice free Arctic ocean

00:28:37.800 --> 00:28:43.260
in the summer within only a matter of a few
years.

00:28:43.260 --> 00:28:46.710
So what about polar bears?

00:28:46.710 --> 00:28:54.730
Well sadly as I've explained polar bears are
truly dependent on sea ice for every essential

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:56.810
aspect of their lives.

00:28:56.810 --> 00:29:04.100
If there is no sea ice they simply cannot
survive over the long term.

00:29:04.100 --> 00:29:11.180
And because of the loss of sea ice that has
already occurred due to rising temperatures

00:29:11.180 --> 00:29:18.180
already, polar bears are already in trouble
in various regions.

00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:24.140
In many parts of the Arctic the amount of
time that polar bears can be out on the Arctic

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:32.710
sea ice hunting seals is decreasing significantly
already basically because the ice in the area

00:29:32.710 --> 00:29:36.140
where they live is disappearing.

00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:42.820
So many of those bears are being forced to
spend increasingly lengthy period of time

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:51.610
stranded on land and without sea ice, without
the ability to hunt for seals, those polar

00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:55.990
bears stranded on land are food deprived.

00:29:55.990 --> 00:30:03.890
Now some of those hungry bears may occasionally
nibble on some vegetation which is basically

00:30:03.890 --> 00:30:10.200
like one of us nibbling on a few potato chips
and trying to survive on that.

00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:17.960
Some of the bears stranded on land may wander
into inhabited areas unfortunately and get

00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:24.080
into trouble by searching for food too close
to people, definitely not a good situation

00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:26.290
at all.

00:30:26.290 --> 00:30:33.030
And some of them may even become so desperately
hungry that they endanger their safety searing

00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:37.940
for alternative foods, like this dare devil
polar bear.

00:30:37.940 --> 00:30:44.280
I photographed this sub-adult, male polar
bear in Novaya Zemlya in the Russian higher

00:30:44.280 --> 00:30:52.100
Arctic and he was stranded on land, food deprived
because the sea ice had disappeared throughout

00:30:52.100 --> 00:31:00.430
the entire region and he was trying unsuccessfully
to eat sea bird eggs on this nearly sheer

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:02.470
cliff.

00:31:02.470 --> 00:31:10.500
So I was there bobbing up and down in a Zodiac
trying to stabilize my 100 to 400mm lens and

00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.750
get some pictures of this incredible site,
and my heart was literally pounding in my

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:22.380
throat because I was so worried that this
crazy bear was gonna fall off that cliff.

00:31:22.380 --> 00:31:30.240
Thankfully he didn't, but he truly risked
his life climbing on the cliff.

00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:35.890
And I think he burned more calories doing
that than he would have gained even if he

00:31:35.890 --> 00:31:40.720
had been able to eat some of those sea bird
eggs.

00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:47.321
As I explained earlier the simple reality
is that polar bears need to eat a very high

00:31:47.321 --> 00:31:49.830
fat diet.

00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:55.820
Alternative foods simply cannot sustain them
over the long term.

00:31:55.820 --> 00:32:01.950
And recently scientists have been documented
incidents involving polar infanticide and

00:32:01.950 --> 00:32:09.220
cannibalism; situations where an adult male
polar bear has killed a younger bear specifically

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.059
for food.

00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:17.770
Now these tragic occurrences appear to be
rare, but scientists believe that they may

00:32:17.770 --> 00:32:26.440
become more common as sea ice increasingly
disappears and it becomes increasingly difficult

00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:30.490
for polar bears to hunt for seals.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:39.430
So as a result of being stranded on land for
increasingly lengthy periods of time and suffering

00:32:39.430 --> 00:32:48.180
chronic nutritional stress, in some areas
polar bears are declining in physical condition,

00:32:48.180 --> 00:32:55.760
fewer cubs are being born because of the deteriorating
condition of adult female polar bears, survival

00:32:55.760 --> 00:33:03.360
rates are being affected in some areas, and
the size of some populations of polar bears

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:06.720
is already declining.

00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:14.720
At this point polar bear scientists have determined
that 8 of the 19 polar bear populations in

00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:23.370
the world are already declining and all polar
bears in all regions of the Arctic will ultimately

00:33:23.370 --> 00:33:31.580
be endangered by loss of their sea ice habitat
if current temperature trends continue.

00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:42.410
But it's also very important to keep in mind
that the consequences of this dramatic transformation

00:33:42.410 --> 00:33:48.700
that's taking place in the Arctic are not
just a problem for polar bears.

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:54.150
Rising temperatures in the Arctic are affecting
entire ecosystems.

00:33:54.150 --> 00:34:00.950
In addition, very importantly what most people
don't realize is that the Arctic plays a very

00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:09.639
important role, an essential role, in regulating
our entire planet's climate system.

00:34:09.639 --> 00:34:17.240
So the impacts of a rapidly warming Arctic
will ultimately affect every living thing

00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:24.290
on earth either directly or indirectly, including
people.

00:34:24.290 --> 00:34:30.830
If rising greenhouse gas emissions and rising
temperatures continue to the point that the

00:34:30.830 --> 00:34:39.629
Arctic becomes uninhabitable by polar bears
we will have completely transformed the climate

00:34:39.629 --> 00:34:45.159
of the entire planet in a very extreme manner.

00:34:45.159 --> 00:34:51.520
In fact that climate transformation will be
so extreme that there will be truly devastating

00:34:51.520 --> 00:35:00.270
consequences all across the globe for every
ecosystem and every population of people.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:08.540
So fundamentally these magnificent animals
really are the charismatic canaries in the

00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:10.560
coal mine.

00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:18.240
Their plight is a clear warning to us that
we must galvanize ourselves into action to

00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:25.240
address climate change not only to protect
polar bears and other Arctic animals and not

00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:32.580
only to protect countless other species in
ecosystems all across the globe, but ultimately

00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:37.650
also to protect ourselves.

00:35:37.650 --> 00:35:43.260
So I'm going to leave you with that very sobering
thought and turn this over to Kassie.

00:35:43.260 --> 00:35:45.450
Again, thank you very much for being here.

00:35:45.450 --> 00:35:51.070
I really appreciate your interest and your
attention and after Kassie's finished I'd

00:35:51.070 --> 00:35:55.090
be very happy to answer whatever questions
you have.

00:35:55.090 --> 00:35:56.960
Thanks a lot.

00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.650
[applause]

00:35:58.650 --> 00:36:06.261
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: Thank you Jenny and a million
thanks to Winnie for setting this up and to

00:36:06.261 --> 00:36:09.580
Google for hosting and for all of you for
coming.

00:36:09.580 --> 00:36:14.120
It's really nice to be part of this conversation
today and great to actually see Jenny's presentation;

00:36:14.120 --> 00:36:18.180
I haven't seen her give a talk in a number
of years, so that was really wonderful, thank

00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:19.180
you Jenny.

00:36:19.180 --> 00:36:24.390
We brought me along to talk about the solutions
and the good news because of course there

00:36:24.390 --> 00:36:26.970
are things we can do for polar bears.

00:36:26.970 --> 00:36:33.670
The two biggies to do for an endangered species
like this: number one remove other threats

00:36:33.670 --> 00:36:38.820
that are stressing them in addition to climate
warming to give them a better chance of making

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:44.190
it; and number two, of course, deep, rapid,
and sustained greenhouse gas reductions.

00:36:44.190 --> 00:36:50.260
And the good news is that we do actually have
the laws on the books today that require both

00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:55.850
those things and so I'd like to very briefly
just do two things: tell the very condensed

00:36:55.850 --> 00:37:00.690
story of getting Endangered Species Act listing
for the polar bear, and then saying a few

00:37:00.690 --> 00:37:05.250
words about where we're going, where we're
headed next and additional things we need

00:37:05.250 --> 00:37:06.590
to do.

00:37:06.590 --> 00:37:11.520
There's a couple of great things about the
Endangered Species Act: it is the world's

00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:19.800
strongest law for the protection of imperiled
species and it specifically allows any person

00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:24.740
to petition to have a species added to the
list of threatened and endangered species,

00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:30.200
provides mandatory timelines for the government
to respond and if they don't you can sue them,

00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:35.770
and requires all of the decisions that the
government make be made only on the basis

00:37:35.770 --> 00:37:38.470
of the best available science.

00:37:38.470 --> 00:37:44.670
So we petitioned to list polar bears because
of global warming back in February of 2005,

00:37:44.670 --> 00:37:49.030
actually on the day that the Kyoto Protocol
entered into force without the participation

00:37:49.030 --> 00:37:50.800
of the United States.

00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:57.760
During the Bush Administration of course the
Bush Administration was not eager to list

00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.960
the polar bear and the other species, was
opposed to this kind of regulation, but because

00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:09.640
of these three aspects of the law we were
able to push this petition forward to listing.

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:14.810
The first strategy the government took was
to just ignore the petition; we sued them;

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:19.740
had to sue them twice; won both times and
got mandatory deadlines from the court by

00:38:19.740 --> 00:38:21.970
which they had to act.

00:38:21.970 --> 00:38:26.760
At that time one of the things we thought
we might have to do was litigate the science

00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.210
of global warming if the Administration decided
not to list the bear which we thought was

00:38:31.210 --> 00:38:39.190
a real possibility; they didn't wanna do it
but we thought we could win in court.

00:38:39.190 --> 00:38:43.740
The fact that they tried to ignore it, we
had to sue a couple times, helped us also

00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:48.740
get media coverage of that, increase a little
bit awareness of the polar bears' plight which

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:51.160
is an important thing.

00:38:51.160 --> 00:38:56.580
Unlike any other species that I've ever work
on there was great suspense, a lot of public

00:38:56.580 --> 00:39:02.270
involvement, over three-quarters of a million
people wrote in saying, "Please protect the

00:39:02.270 --> 00:39:03.610
bear, we want you to do this."

00:39:03.610 --> 00:39:06.740
The eyes of the world were truly on the Administration.

00:39:06.740 --> 00:39:11.840
Right up until the day that they had to make
the decision based on the court order we didn't

00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.120
know what the decision was going to be and
in fact later in litigation that's still going

00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:22.330
on we found a memo from the head of the U.S.
Fish and Wildlife Service, which is the wildlife

00:39:22.330 --> 00:39:27.200
management agency, he said, "The Assistant
Secretary of the Interior called me," so the

00:39:27.200 --> 00:39:31.740
Secretary of the Interior is the final decision
maker and said, "The Secretary is not gonna

00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.280
list the polar bear."

00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:38.030
This was just about a week before the final
decision and I said, "Well alright that's

00:39:38.030 --> 00:39:42.810
his decision to make, but I shouldn't be at
the press conference because I can't support

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:45.450
that decision, I think the bear should be
listed."

00:39:45.450 --> 00:39:50.300
Somewhere in that week, this was at the very
highest levels of the Administration, the

00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.450
decision changed and the Bush Administration
did list the bear.

00:39:52.450 --> 00:39:56.100
I think that's because they didn't wanna litigate
the science of climate change.

00:39:56.100 --> 00:40:00.570
So they listed the bear and this brings some
really strong legal protections: things like

00:40:00.570 --> 00:40:05.790
the designation of critical habitat, those
are the areas essential for their survival

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:13.220
and recovery of the bear, and vast areas of
the Arctic Ocean and near shore areas in Alaska

00:40:13.220 --> 00:40:16.080
have now been designated as critical habitat.

00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:20.580
The oil industry in the State of Alaska and
others are suing over that trying to get it

00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:25.290
undesignated and so we're defending it but
that is a big protection.

00:40:25.290 --> 00:40:29.430
They have to prepare a recovery plan and they
are doing that now and we hope for the first

00:40:29.430 --> 00:40:35.910
time this recovery plan will set out the specific
greenhouse gas reductions that are needed

00:40:35.910 --> 00:40:39.130
in order to protect the Arctic sea ice and
protect the bear.

00:40:39.130 --> 00:40:47.520
There's also something that requires, all
federal agencies are gonna carry out or approve

00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:52.150
an action that might impact the bears to consult
with the Wildlife Management Agency, the U.S.

00:40:52.150 --> 00:40:56.130
Fish and Wildlife Service, on the impact of
their action.

00:40:56.130 --> 00:40:59.550
This has been a very successful program.

00:40:59.550 --> 00:41:04.260
Most species once they're added to the list
have not gone extinct; only two species ever

00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:09.320
have become extinct after being listed; very,
very successful.

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:14.270
Global warming of course though poses a new
and overwhelming threat and people often ask,

00:41:14.270 --> 00:41:15.720
"Well what's the point really?

00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.800
The Endangered Species Act can't do anything
about greenhouse gases."

00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:25.960
Actually it can; this consultation provision
is one of the areas where we want to see that

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:27.310
happen.

00:41:27.310 --> 00:41:33.200
Wildlife management agencies look at ways
to reduce pesticides that harm frogs, mercury

00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:37.680
that harms fish, dams that harm salmon, etcetera.

00:41:37.680 --> 00:41:41.450
Both the Bush Administration and the Obama
Administration have taken the position that

00:41:41.450 --> 00:41:46.560
greenhouse gases are somehow exempt from this
portion of the law.

00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.430
And we're not arguing that the Endangered
Species Act is a complete solution to global

00:41:50.430 --> 00:41:52.870
warming, of course it's not.

00:41:52.870 --> 00:41:57.160
It's not even the leading domestic law for
greenhouse reductions, that's actually the

00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.490
Clean Air Act.

00:41:58.490 --> 00:42:04.290
But I think it's a really important point
because for some reason it is a powerful argument

00:42:04.290 --> 00:42:10.109
that any given tool is not the best tool or
the right tool for reducing greenhouse emissions.

00:42:10.109 --> 00:42:14.060
So for example, opponents will argue, "We
shouldn't be using the Endangered Species

00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.190
Act, that's not suited, that was not the intent
of the Endangered Species Act for greenhouse

00:42:18.190 --> 00:42:20.920
emissions, let's use the Clean Air Act."

00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:23.800
But then when we get to the Clean Air Act
they say, "No the Clean Air Act is not the

00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:27.990
right tool, let's use a market based cap and
trade program."

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:34.690
But then when we get to having cap and trade
legislation introduced in Congress that legislation

00:42:34.690 --> 00:42:35.690
is killed.

00:42:35.690 --> 00:42:40.520
So there's a lot of debate over what is the
right tool and I think that the urgency of

00:42:40.520 --> 00:42:47.810
the situation clearly requires that we be
using all tools in the box, not arguing about

00:42:47.810 --> 00:42:51.180
which one is the best while doing nothing
at all.

00:42:51.180 --> 00:42:55.590
The Bush Administration exempted greenhouse
emissions from the reach of the Endangered

00:42:55.590 --> 00:42:58.650
Species Act; we've been in litigation over
that.

00:42:58.650 --> 00:43:03.080
We did win on that part of the case and that
part of the decision has been sent back to

00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:08.280
the Obama Administration for reconsideration
and there will be a public comment period

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:11.250
opening up on that next month.

00:43:11.250 --> 00:43:16.480
And we hope that we will have the same level
of involvement in that in having folks say,

00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:23.290
"Hey, we really shouldn't exempt the number
one threat to the species from the law."

00:43:23.290 --> 00:43:28.170
The other piece of the good news is that we
have the strongest domestic environmental

00:43:28.170 --> 00:43:29.340
laws in the world.

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:34.270
The Clean Air Act is actually all set up and
ready to go to reduce emissions from all sectors

00:43:34.270 --> 00:43:39.450
of the economy, has been a very successful
law, it is political barriers that we are

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.980
facing.

00:43:40.980 --> 00:43:45.700
We have widespread non-implementation and
under implementation of our existing laws

00:43:45.700 --> 00:43:51.230
for political reasons not for legal reasons,
I think not for technological reasons.

00:43:51.230 --> 00:43:57.160
We have so much low hanging fruit we need
deep and sustained emissions reductions, but

00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:02.320
through energy efficiency, through existing
technology, and through speeding the development

00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:08.030
and deployment of new technology we really
can, we really can solve this problem, we

00:44:08.030 --> 00:44:13.190
really do have the legal framework, but we
have to get beyond the political barriers.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:16.690
That requires involvement from everyone.

00:44:16.690 --> 00:44:22.940
I truly don't think that the polar bear would
have been listed as a threatened species had

00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:30.160
it not been for involvement, so my plea to
you is to get involved in this in pushing

00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:34.290
for action on the climate crisis in whatever
way is most appealing to you.

00:44:34.290 --> 00:44:38.520
If you would like to get involved through
the Center I would not be any kind of activist

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.280
without my clipboards and so I do have them
here.

00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:44.820
They're in the back of the room on that table.

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:50.270
Please do, we have a general sign up sheet,
we have a petition to the EPA which is headlined

00:44:50.270 --> 00:44:55.990
by Dr. Jim Hansen, leading scientist at NASA,
Bill McKibben and others asking the EPA to

00:44:55.990 --> 00:45:02.430
use the Clean Air Act to reduce greenhouse
gases back to below 350 parts per million;

00:45:02.430 --> 00:45:07.230
various other materials, please do take them
they're heavy, we don't produce a lot of paper

00:45:07.230 --> 00:45:12.520
but I brought quite a lot today and I will
stop there and I look forward to the discussion.

00:45:12.520 --> 00:45:13.520
Thanks so much everybody.

00:45:13.520 --> 00:45:14.520
[applause]

00:45:14.520 --> 00:45:15.520
Do you wanna come up?

00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:18.390
&gt;&gt;male #1: Regarding the Endangered Species
Act and that protection you'd shown a picture

00:45:18.390 --> 00:45:20.140
that there's many, many countries in certain
polar regions and so this is only covering

00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:32.690
a tiny fraction it seems, the U.S. portion,
so regarding protection for the bear and its

00:45:32.690 --> 00:45:55.880
habitat in is it Russia or Canada would seem
to be far more greater in terms of the space

00:45:55.880 --> 00:45:57.927
that the polar bear lives, what's going on
in those regions and does it really matter

00:45:57.927 --> 00:45:58.927
then if the U.S. has all this great protection
and 90 percent of the terrain not protected?

00:45:58.927 --> 00:45:59.927
This seem pretty much a Quixotic effort, chasing
windmills.

00:45:59.927 --> 00:46:00.970
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: The bear is actually listed
everywhere.

00:46:00.970 --> 00:46:05.410
You can list the worldwide species which is
what happened.

00:46:05.410 --> 00:46:12.160
Of course only people subject to the jurisdiction
of the U.S. have their behavior curtailed

00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.570
by the Endangered Species Act.

00:46:13.570 --> 00:46:24.880
The Critical Habitat Designation is actually
only the U.S. land area.

00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:30.940
Canada actually has two-thirds of the world's
polar bears and the big conservation issue

00:46:30.940 --> 00:46:36.190
in Canada beyond global warming and oil spill
is over hunting.

00:46:36.190 --> 00:46:39.860
Unfortunately Canada's the only country in
the world that still allows a trophy hunt

00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:48.750
of polar bears and unfortunately even though
hunting was addressed fairly well by the 1973

00:46:48.750 --> 00:46:54.990
Polar Bear Treaty, in 1994 the U.S. Marine
Mammal Protection Act was amended to once

00:46:54.990 --> 00:46:59.600
again allow the import of trophy hunted polar
bear carcasses into the U.S.

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:03.500
Since that time hunting levels went way, way
up again.

00:47:03.500 --> 00:47:09.590
One of the ramifications of the listing under
the ESA was that you can no longer import

00:47:09.590 --> 00:47:13.380
trophy hunted polar bears from Canada into
the U.S.

00:47:13.380 --> 00:47:18.160
So I think that that hasn't entirely solved
the problem, there's other ways we are trying

00:47:18.160 --> 00:47:19.160
to go about that.

00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.570
In Canada there is certainly a big international
market for polar bear parts but there has

00:47:24.570 --> 00:47:30.350
been some benefit internationally and can
be a lot of benefits.

00:47:30.350 --> 00:47:31.369
[pause]

00:47:31.369 --> 00:47:34.450
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: Yes.

00:47:34.450 --> 00:47:43.969
&gt;&gt;male #2: Could you elaborate on the ramifications
for the rest of the world if all of the the

00:47:43.969 --> 00:47:44.969
Arctic ice were to disappear?

00:47:44.969 --> 00:47:45.969
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: I'm sorry.

00:47:45.969 --> 00:47:46.969
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: Yeah I'm sorry I didn't hear
the first part.

00:47:46.969 --> 00:47:47.969
If all the Arctic ice were to disappear --

00:47:47.969 --> 00:47:50.882
&gt;&gt;male #2: what would be the implications
for the rest of the world?

00:47:50.882 --> 00:47:51.882
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: Oh, great question.

00:47:51.882 --> 00:47:52.882
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: Yes, yes, yes.

00:47:52.882 --> 00:47:56.510
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: [chuckles] Great question,
I think we were both condensing today.

00:47:56.510 --> 00:47:57.510
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: Yes.

00:47:57.510 --> 00:48:01.190
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: It just so happens [chuckles]
that the things we need to do to save the

00:48:01.190 --> 00:48:07.840
Arctic ice, I mean the polar bear is worth
saving for itself as a magnificent animal,

00:48:07.840 --> 00:48:11.890
but it just so happens that the things we
need to do to save the Arctic sea ice are

00:48:11.890 --> 00:48:14.750
the things we need to do to save the rest
of the world as well.

00:48:14.750 --> 00:48:18.410
And I'm sure everybody knows, I mean climate
change is here now.

00:48:18.410 --> 00:48:23.580
If you live in Bangladesh or you live in the
Sub-Saharan in Africa or you live in the Inuit

00:48:23.580 --> 00:48:28.369
community up in the Arctic, I mean rapid climate
change is happening now.

00:48:28.369 --> 00:48:32.320
And one of the things I find so exciting about
working on the polar bear is we don't save

00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:39.770
the bear without saving the Arctic ice pack
has huge ramifications for the global climate

00:48:39.770 --> 00:48:40.770
system.

00:48:40.770 --> 00:48:45.700
The Arctic ice pack as Jenny alluded to acts
as the air conditioner for the planet and

00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:49.190
when the ice melts it's like unplugging that
air conditioner.

00:48:49.190 --> 00:48:54.960
The reflectivity is one of the feedbacks in
the Arctic; release of methane as the permafrost

00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:57.390
thaws, another feedback.

00:48:57.390 --> 00:49:02.980
If we don't act soon enough to slow these
feedbacks we're looking at impacts like 20

00:49:02.980 --> 00:49:05.800
feet of more of sea level rise around the
world.

00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:10.780
So it's not that I don't think the polar bear
is important in itself, I do of course I'm

00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:16.800
a biodiversity activist, but it's entirely
connected, saving the Arctic is entirely connected

00:49:16.800 --> 00:49:20.500
to solving all the other problems around the
world as well.

00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:27.390
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: And to just give you a few specific
examples: sea level rise, as Kassie mentioned,

00:49:27.390 --> 00:49:34.849
now that's not from the Arctic sea ice melting
'cause that's ice that's floating on ocean;

00:49:34.849 --> 00:49:41.690
we'll get approximately 23, 24 feet of sea
level rise from the melting of the Greenland

00:49:41.690 --> 00:49:46.800
ice cap and that doesn't even include Antarctica.

00:49:46.800 --> 00:49:55.670
If we lose all of that land ice we're looking
at sea level rise in the range of 230 feet;

00:49:55.670 --> 00:49:59.570
entire countries will be under water.

00:49:59.570 --> 00:50:06.430
And long before that, major cities, major
coastal cities, will be flooded.

00:50:06.430 --> 00:50:11.840
Imagine permanent flooding throughout downtown
Manhattan.

00:50:11.840 --> 00:50:18.670
Apart from flooding there is going to be an
increased incident of very severe storms of

00:50:18.670 --> 00:50:27.580
various kinds, chronic severe droughts, shortages
of fresh water, shortages of food related

00:50:27.580 --> 00:50:34.460
to the failure of agriculture because huge
regions that are now productive land are gonna

00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:42.270
be transformed into essentially desiccated
deserts, wide spread extinction of species,

00:50:42.270 --> 00:50:48.160
ocean acidification because the oceans absorb
a lot of that carbon dioxide from the air

00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:56.170
and that causes the water to acidify and as
the water becomes more acid that destroys

00:50:56.170 --> 00:51:02.110
the ability of many creatures to function
at all and some of them that build shells

00:51:02.110 --> 00:51:08.200
can't build their shells anymore and that's
gonna disrupt the entire ocean food chain.

00:51:08.200 --> 00:51:15.560
So if we wipe out a lot of the marine food
chain, I don't know what the percentage is,

00:51:15.560 --> 00:51:23.280
I think it's like 80 to 85 percent of people
on our planet rely on protein from the oceans

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:24.359
for their food.

00:51:24.359 --> 00:51:29.230
So you can see that one thing leads to another
leads to another leads to another and as I

00:51:29.230 --> 00:51:35.790
said the implications are staggering; they
will affect literally every living thing on

00:51:35.790 --> 00:51:40.501
earth including every population of people
all around the globe.

00:51:40.501 --> 00:51:41.501
[pause]

00:51:41.501 --> 00:51:42.501
&gt;&gt;male #3: So sort of on a slightly different
topic but can you describe how you take these

00:51:42.501 --> 00:51:43.501
wonderful pictures --

00:51:43.501 --> 00:51:44.501
[laughter]

00:51:44.501 --> 00:51:53.200
how you find yourself on the Zodiac, fight
off the polar bears so they don't eat you.

00:51:53.200 --> 00:52:04.430
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: [laughs] Well there's a lot
of variation in what is involved depending

00:52:04.430 --> 00:52:08.869
on the specific location and specific circumstances.

00:52:08.869 --> 00:52:16.420
For some of those photographs I was in a Zodiac
down at polar bear level; in some situations

00:52:16.420 --> 00:52:23.470
I'm on the ground on the ice, sometimes in
a vehicle, sometimes in a larger boat, just

00:52:23.470 --> 00:52:29.350
totally depends on the specific location and
the circumstances.

00:52:29.350 --> 00:52:37.119
But as far as having to fight off polar bears
is concerned, yes of course they are carnivores

00:52:37.119 --> 00:52:42.240
but they would much rather eat a seal than
a person.

00:52:42.240 --> 00:52:45.660
So I've never been in a situation where I
felt threatened.

00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:53.260
Of course I'm very careful but it's not as
if polar bears are out looking for people

00:52:53.260 --> 00:52:54.260
to eat.

00:52:54.260 --> 00:53:03.960
&gt;&gt;male #4: Well you had a lot of pictures
of young cubs, I imagine you got close to

00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:04.960
one of those [unintelligible].

00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:05.960
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: Sure.

00:53:05.960 --> 00:53:07.970
You have to again be very, very careful.

00:53:07.970 --> 00:53:16.990
It's important to understand behavior, not
only to be able to take photographs that communicate

00:53:16.990 --> 00:53:22.880
interesting and useful things to people, but
also so that you can behave appropriately

00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:25.180
in proximity to bears.

00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:31.790
So because every bear is an individual they
don't all react the same way, they have different

00:53:31.790 --> 00:53:39.240
levels of tolerance for people being in proximity
and you have to be sensitive to that.

00:53:39.240 --> 00:53:43.410
Reading them is essential.

00:53:43.410 --> 00:53:50.030
And I never put myself into a situation where
I'm close and I have no exit strategy.

00:53:50.030 --> 00:53:57.220
So in a lot of those photographs of mothers
and cubs it appears that I'm very, very close

00:53:57.220 --> 00:54:02.760
but I'm in the Zodiac and they're at the edge
of the sea ice so I have the ability to back

00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:04.840
off if I need to.

00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:08.980
And I'm also most of the time, not all the
time, but much of the time I'm using a very

00:54:08.980 --> 00:54:14.550
long lens so I'm not quite as close as it
appears that I am.

00:54:14.550 --> 00:54:15.550
[pause]

00:54:15.550 --> 00:54:23.760
&gt;&gt;male #5: What' the strategy for [unintelligible]
countries outside of America [unintelligible]

00:54:23.760 --> 00:54:30.090
&gt;&gt;Kassie Siegel: Well I'm sorry to say that
the U.S. has long been a laggard and that

00:54:30.090 --> 00:54:35.240
the rest of the world is actually doing a
lot more, most of the rest of the world is

00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.650
doing a lot more than the U.S.

00:54:36.650 --> 00:54:42.430
So the main forum for that is the U.N. Framework
Convention on Climate Change, international

00:54:42.430 --> 00:54:45.100
climate talks.

00:54:45.100 --> 00:54:51.071
In 1992 the whole world agreed to take the
actions necessary to avoid dangerous climate

00:54:51.071 --> 00:54:56.030
change, the U.S. Senate ratified that agreement,
also in there is the notion of common but

00:54:56.030 --> 00:55:01.119
differentiated responsibilities, that is the
rich developed countries of the world caused

00:55:01.119 --> 00:55:05.099
the problem, they will take the lead in solving
the problem.

00:55:05.099 --> 00:55:10.660
We signed that, we ratified it, the first
binding, concrete agreement to reduce emissions

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:13.050
was in 1997 the Kyoto Protocol.

00:55:13.050 --> 00:55:17.890
When the Clinton Administration negotiated
that treaty they actually got a lot of concessions

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:22.880
from the rest of the world in terms of making
the emissions reduction smaller and how those

00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:28.270
reductions would be achieved, but after signing
the agreement in Kyoto the U.S. Senate, it

00:55:28.270 --> 00:55:32.900
was never submitted to the U.S. Senate for
ratification because the U.S. Senate voted

00:55:32.900 --> 00:55:38.640
95 to 0 in a non-binding resolution that the
U.S. shouldn't do anything unless the rest

00:55:38.640 --> 00:55:41.380
of the world also took on binding targets.

00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:47.460
Kyoto Protocol has binding, mandatory reductions
from the developed countries of the world,

00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:52.349
while the developing countries would take
other actions as they try to reduce their

00:55:52.349 --> 00:55:55.470
emissions' intensity while they continue to
develop.

00:55:55.470 --> 00:56:01.730
I'm sorry to say that since '97 things have
continued to devolve, be happy to talk about

00:56:01.730 --> 00:56:10.220
it more after the talk if you'd like, but
it is just, the U.S. has been blocking progress

00:56:10.220 --> 00:56:15.020
at those talks and a lot of the rest of the
world is going on and doing more without the

00:56:15.020 --> 00:56:16.020
U.S.

00:56:16.020 --> 00:56:21.060
But we need to change things domestically
here and I think that's the number one thing

00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.420
that will jump start international progress.

00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.000
And I think we should wrap it up 'cause we're
a little over time.

00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:28.870
So thank you so much everyone for coming.

00:56:28.870 --> 00:56:29.870
&gt;&gt;Jenny Ross: Thanks very much.

00:56:29.870 --> 00:56:29.871
[applause]
