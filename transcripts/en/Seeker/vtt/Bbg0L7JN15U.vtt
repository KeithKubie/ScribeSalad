00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.880
You may not be wearing an insulated wetsuit
like Pacific swimmer Ben Lecomte,

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:11.420
but part of the outfit you’re wearing right now is
going to come in contact with the ocean

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.600
eventually.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:24.740
The new invisible threat that they're discovering
is that microfiber from all our clothes

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.120
ends up in the ocean, and now they're finding
already that it's being ingested by animals.

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:33.820
Does it pass through or does it end up in
their flesh, and then we end up eating it?

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.540
These are the questions Dimitri Deheyn and
his team at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.500
are exploring, as they work with The Swim expedition
to investigate the strange little strings

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:46.260
known as microfibers.

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:52.740
Unfortunately, the fish will probably have
microfibers in its gut.

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.020
So do I, and so do you.

00:00:55.020 --> 00:01:01.440
It is estimated that every single person would
have about three to five million microfibers

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.920
going through their body on a given day.

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.320
Shed by synthetic materials like polyester,
spandex, and nylon, microfibers are so abundant

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:15.320
that the filters once designed to catch them
clogged so dramatically that companies removed

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:17.600
them from washing machines altogether.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.100
Today, these particles flush freely into waterways
with every spin cycle.

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:27.760
Microfibers are about five microns in size
or smaller,

00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:31.000
about 20 times smaller than the diameter of your hair.

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.720
Microfibers are so small that they are
 able to adsorb contaminants;

00:01:34.720 --> 00:01:39.240
and those contaminants may be many times more concentrated than in the surrounding water.

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:47.060
Microfibers are tinier and carry more charge
than microplastics, meaning they may be circulated

00:01:47.060 --> 00:01:51.880
more quickly throughout global water and air
currents, and soak up more toxins or microorganisms

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:52.720
along the way.

00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:58.219
They are so small that they are like little
needles that can poke a cell.

00:01:58.219 --> 00:02:02.890
These microfibers have been found in places
as remote as the North Pole.

00:02:02.890 --> 00:02:07.840
There are now increasing reports of microfibers
from Europe, from the United States of course

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.140
from South America

00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.480
and of course from Asia.

00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:13.140
They are found in bottled water.

00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:17.140
They are found in water fountains 
and anything that links to water,

00:02:17.140 --> 00:02:20.820
beer, wine, any kind of
 liquid might contain some

00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:22.600
microfiber, to some extent.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.960
Those microfibers can go inside the cells
of the digestive tract, and from there,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:29.480
can they pass on into other tissues?

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:32.000
Can it affect asthma?

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.330
Irritation from the respiratory passages?

00:02:35.330 --> 00:02:36.640
Or anything else?

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.360
With the help of the Seeker crew, Dimitri
and his team are collecting samples of ocean

00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:47.300
water and fish flesh to see if they can unravel
the mystery of microfibers’ impact.

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:53.480
In terms of knowing what we breathe, what
we eat, and what we drink,

00:02:53.480 --> 00:03:00.580
it is important that we have a heat map of where microfibers are mainly concentrated.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:05.420
We expect that every single big city would
kind of have an area around it that would

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.640
be rich in microfibers, associated 
with where sewage

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:13.980
is discharged, but we don't really know what's
truly offshore, far away from that.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:36.330
We don't just try and catch fish to eat.

00:03:36.330 --> 00:03:42.320
We also are collecting samples from their
flesh, which we send back to be dissolved

00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:44.540
and to see if there's microfiber in there.

00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:49.620
To count the fibers in the samples from the
boat, the team uses a blacklight,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:52.260
because microfibers are fluorescent.

00:03:52.270 --> 00:03:54.320
Many things in the ocean could fluoresce.

00:03:54.320 --> 00:04:00.700
We have some sort of a program that can teach
the computer to recognize

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.860
what microfibers are based on their shape, based on their length, and based on the combination

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:07.700
of spectral characteristics.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:13.600
The technology analyzes the images using face
recognition software.

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:20.880
So once microfibers can be mapped, Dimitri's
team tests how these synthetic particulates

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:25.880
could actually impact our health, by using
light production from species as a potential clue.

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:31.160
Organisms in the ocean that produce light, 
when they don’t feel good, they produce less light.

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:34.740
That's a brittle star, tiny, tiny one.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:38.540
Evolutionary speaking, these animals are very
close to you and I.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:45.320
Its light production is directly correlated
to the health of the nervous system.

00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:51.700
So if the light does not follow a certain
pattern, we can assess neurotoxicity.

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:57.200
It's good to use them as a proxy to what we
could have as an impact for our own nervous system.

00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:14.520
My vision for the future is positive.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.020
We will start to learn from nature.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:24.100
And that's the concept of biomimicry: what can we learn
from nature to be the best integrated in nature?

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:31.760
Companies are already focusing on biomimicry
aspects of microfibers in clothing

00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:37.420
so that whatever we will generate will be fully reintegrated into the environment.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:39.620
We live in nature.

00:05:39.620 --> 00:05:40.740
We are part of nature.

00:05:40.740 --> 00:05:43.439
We are part of a closed system.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.669
We have water flowing through us and food
flowing through us, and whatever pollution

00:05:47.669 --> 00:05:50.760
we put out there, that will be flowing through
us as well.

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:51.760
Eventually.
