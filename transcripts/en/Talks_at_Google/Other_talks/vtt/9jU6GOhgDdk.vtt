BOB: Thanks for
coming, everybody.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.620
Virginia Heffernan has
written for "The New York

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.110
Times," for "Slate,"
for "Wired,"

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:14.310
for "Harper's," "Yahoo News."

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:16.639
We won't hold that
against her, though.

00:00:16.639 --> 00:00:18.680
I actually read the whole
thing over the weekend,

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.220
and that's saying something,
because I don't always

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.250
read these books.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:25.350
But it's a really good read and
I encourage you all to buy it.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:27.870
We have a lot of people
talk about, oh, the internet

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:30.080
is changing everything,
and you're probably

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:31.480
as tired of it as I am.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.960
But this isn't really like that.

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:36.820
This has made me think about
things like why pictures are

00:00:36.820 --> 00:00:39.600
taken over the internet--
because even though I was here

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.730
the whole time, it didn't
kind of surprise me--

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.530
and also why
telephone calls were

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:52.750
really good in the old days,
and now they kind of suck.

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:55.510
But what Virginia's going to
talk about today especially

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:59.190
is YouTube, in fact
reading from her chapter.

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.266
So please welcome
Virginia Heffernan.

00:01:02.266 --> 00:01:07.570
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:07.570 --> 00:01:10.930
VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN:
Thank you very much, Bob.

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.720
This is like really is
like being at Angkor Wat.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:16.620
I've never been to
Angkor Wat, but I have it

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.170
in my head, in the same
place in my heart and brain,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.600
as the Googleplex.

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:25.240
So I live up to it.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.080
Live up to it.

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.230
I usually just talk, but
because you're Google,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.900
I thought it would be
interesting to talk

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:37.090
a little bit about
my fascination

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:40.580
with YouTube before
the Google acquisition.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.510
"So cast your minds back
to January 25th, 2006,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:47.390
when a mysterious
image showed up

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.510
on YouTube, the video
sharing site that

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:51.660
was then only three months old.

00:01:51.660 --> 00:01:55.020
A sinewy figure in a
swimming pool blue t-shirt,

00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.650
his eyes obscured by
a beige baseball cap,

00:01:57.650 --> 00:01:59.330
was playing guitar.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:02:01.720
Sun poured through
a window behind him.

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.720
He played in a yellow haze.

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:07.240
The video was called
simply "Guitar."

00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:11.430
A handmade title card gave the
performer's name as Funtwo.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.920
The piece Funtwo played
with mounting dexterity

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.855
was an exceedingly
difficult rock arrangement

00:02:15.855 --> 00:02:18.720
of "Pachelbel's
Canon," the composition

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:22.550
known from the turn of the
century for solemn chord

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.810
progressions and
overexposure at weddings.

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.140
But this arrangement,
attributed on another slide

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.580
to someone called Jerry C.,
was anything but plodding.

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.780
It required high-level mastery
of a singularly demanding

00:02:34.780 --> 00:02:37.320
maneuver called sweep picking.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.160
Over and over the
guitarist's left hand

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.600
articulated strings with
barely perceptible movements,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.750
sounding and muting notes
almost simultaneously

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.300
and playing complete
arpeggios with a single stroke

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:49.680
of his right hand.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.800
The video was
thrilling to watch.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.990
Almost instantly I was hooked.

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.330
I hadn't yet seen
selfies of any kind,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:00.190
hand-held or selfie
stick-enabled,

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.000
nor had I seen video
on Skype or Facetime.

00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.780
So I wasn't accustomed
to this intensely focused

00:03:05.780 --> 00:03:08.980
exhibitionism, the pleasingly
distorted self-portraits

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:12.040
and moving pixels, often of
family and intimate friends,

00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:13.870
that now flood our screens.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.730
Funtwo's own selfie video
was curious, masturbatory,

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.320
David Hockney colors
plus chiaroscuro.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.930
The effect was not wholesome.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.960
The video lacked the creamy
resolution, crystalline audio,

00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:28.850
and voluptuous
effects associated

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.880
with professionalism, and with
even the average MTV entry.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:34.710
Amateur.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:35.490
Homemade.

00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:36.240
Flawed.

00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:38.960
Not so much mesmerizing
as provocative.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.440
The critic Harold Bloom
wrote that "to behold

00:03:41.440 --> 00:03:42.910
is a tragic posture.

00:03:42.910 --> 00:03:45.600
To observe is an ethical one."

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.060
Funtwo required near
clinical observation.

00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:52.700
You didn't behold this video
as you might a Hollywood movie.

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:55.670
Enraptured by the spectacle,
you inclined toward it

00:03:55.670 --> 00:03:58.050
and you studied it
like a scientist.

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:01.270
You peered as at scrambled
porn on a high and forbidden

00:04:01.270 --> 00:04:03.180
channel.

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.970
As soon as I leaned forward, I
had reached for Tolkien's ring,

00:04:06.970 --> 00:04:08.980
or tasted some
life-altering drug,

00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:12.400
or crossed a magical line,
and there was no going back.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.950
Just as Nabokov forces us to
take Humbert Humbert's language

00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:18.600
into our very mouths in the
opening of his great novel

00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:23.280
of child rape, Lolita,
the tip of the tongue

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.310
taking a trip of three
steps down the palate

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:29.760
to tap at three on the teeth.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.190
This video seemed to implicate
anyone who watched it.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:35.782
I played guitar
again, then again.

00:04:35.782 --> 00:04:38.240
A small miracle was quietly
happening in those first months

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:39.170
on the site.

00:04:39.170 --> 00:04:41.210
The bonafide pornography
that was widely

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:43.510
expected to drive out
all other video genres,

00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:47.200
as a predator plant strangles
diverse flora and unbalances

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.730
ecosystems, never showed up.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.150
Without actual porn, the
subtle voyeurism of guitar

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:55.590
stood a chance of becoming
a hit with viewers.

00:04:55.590 --> 00:04:57.460
And hit it was.

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.260
By the end of its
first week on YouTube,

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:01.830
the video had already been
viewed one million times.

00:05:01.830 --> 00:05:05.870
By 2016 its various versions
had drawn more than 10 million

00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.230
views, and for years
it was regularly

00:05:08.230 --> 00:05:10.200
listed among the
most seen snippets

00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:13.190
of online video in the
history of the World Wide Web.

00:05:13.190 --> 00:05:16.710
We are now used to numbers
like-- 10 million views you

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.070
probably didn't even look up.

00:05:18.070 --> 00:05:20.710
But I was reviewing
television at "The New York

00:05:20.710 --> 00:05:23.960
Times" at the time, and
no one could get a view.

00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:26.180
The people that had
made "30 Something"

00:05:26.180 --> 00:05:30.430
put up a new show on
NBC, and you know,

00:05:30.430 --> 00:05:32.575
they got 15 million
viewers the first night,

00:05:32.575 --> 00:05:34.390
and this is on the networks.

00:05:34.390 --> 00:05:36.730
So I was reviewing television,
and I saw this video,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.950
and it was like--
Marshall Hereskovitz, who

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:45.674
made "30 Something,"
said, where is everybody?

00:05:45.674 --> 00:05:47.590
Where are these viewers
I've been looking for?

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:51.070
When I went to YouTube,
I realized, they're here.

00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:52.970
I know where they are.

00:05:52.970 --> 00:05:54.560
Working as a critic
and a columnist

00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:56.270
for "The New York
Times," I'd acquired

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.110
some unusual new habits
since YouTube launched.

00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.590
Guitar only threw the
problem into relief.

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.940
As network television
contracted,

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.060
the media business folded
dozens of magazines,

00:06:07.060 --> 00:06:08.630
and YouTube was
acquired by Google

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:11.090
for $1.65 billion
dollars-- again,

00:06:11.090 --> 00:06:14.910
sounds like a small number now--
with other one billion-plus

00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:18.220
tech acquisitions and giant
IPOs in the offing-- I found

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.230
myself mystified by how
much time I spent away

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:23.810
from the tattered armchair
tokens of my youth--

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:28.430
books, magazines, newspapers,
the broadcast networks,

00:06:28.430 --> 00:06:32.104
and the ever-present
murmur of NPR.

00:06:32.104 --> 00:06:34.020
While there was still
achievement and pleasure

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:37.240
in the old media, it was clear,
too, that the dogs had barked.

00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:39.540
The great caravan that brings
knowledge and ideas that

00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:42.559
shore up human
enterprises had moved on.

00:06:42.559 --> 00:06:44.850
I renewed my subscriptions
to "Vogue" and "The New York

00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:47.540
Review of Books" until
I didn't anymore.

00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.930
Back issues piled up
on my coffee table

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:52.250
and then became part of
recycling, landfills,

00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:53.710
and compost.

00:06:53.710 --> 00:06:56.990
They weren't culture,
they were carbon,

00:06:56.990 --> 00:06:59.430
part of the problem gumming
up the environmental works.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.710
The same thing
happened to the novels

00:07:01.710 --> 00:07:03.860
that I ordered in
hard copy from Amazon.

00:07:03.860 --> 00:07:05.390
The spell that had
been cast over me

00:07:05.390 --> 00:07:08.110
by inked letters on
white pulp was broken,

00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:10.320
or more accurately, a
new spell had been cast

00:07:10.320 --> 00:07:12.730
on a separate part of my brain.

00:07:12.730 --> 00:07:16.260
The deeper I ventured into the
civilization I found online,

00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:19.700
the more I realized I'd need
more new models of courage

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:22.950
and imagination to contend with
the trippy, slanted, infinite

00:07:22.950 --> 00:07:25.430
dreamland of the
rapidly evolving web.

00:07:25.430 --> 00:07:27.620
Funtwo became my hero.

00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:31.060
The velocity, intricacy, and
exactness of his performance

00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:35.840
modeled the rhythms and mental
requirements of the web itself.

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:38.910
Funtwo's guitar video speaks
to me now, a decade later,

00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:40.725
just as a chalice of
certain dimensions

00:07:40.725 --> 00:07:42.350
tells us something
about the people who

00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:44.227
inhabited a lost world.

00:07:44.227 --> 00:07:46.310
From a chalice we know how
big were the hands that

00:07:46.310 --> 00:07:49.290
were meant to hold it, how much
liquid people liked and could

00:07:49.290 --> 00:07:53.880
consume, what kind of liquid,
cold or hot, basic or acidic,

00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:56.290
they considered potable,
what type of surface

00:07:56.290 --> 00:07:58.540
their cups might sit on.

00:07:58.540 --> 00:08:01.730
The dozens of hours that I
spent feeding my obsession

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:06.030
with guitar were not
wasted, or not entirely,

00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.030
or so I told myself.

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:09.880
That video was, in
fact, as Funtwo--

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:12.350
who was born Jeong-Hyun Lim
--told me when I finally

00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:14.920
met him, it was intended
to be instructional,

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:18.560
an early contribution to the
now encyclopedic how to category

00:08:18.560 --> 00:08:21.060
on YouTube, which I
would later consult

00:08:21.060 --> 00:08:23.720
to learn umbilical care
for my infant daughter

00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:25.890
as well as how to shield
an iPad from scratches

00:08:25.890 --> 00:08:28.040
and how to make progress
in a Wii game called

00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:30.500
LEGO City Undercover.

00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.520
That's not cheating.

00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:34.210
That was learning
how to make progress.

00:08:34.210 --> 00:08:36.919
For me, the video contained
a powerful suggestion

00:08:36.919 --> 00:08:38.586
of the kind of person
I'd have to become

00:08:38.586 --> 00:08:41.127
if I was to keep a clear head
in the new medium that had come

00:08:41.127 --> 00:08:42.280
to dominate my mental life.

00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.939
And I was not alone.

00:08:43.939 --> 00:08:45.980
The internet was pervading
the lives of all of us

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.360
who were growing into
this newly transmogrified

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:52.540
social and aesthetic space, from
my neighbors and colleagues,

00:08:52.540 --> 00:08:55.540
friends and children, to
musicians in Taiwan and Seoul

00:08:55.540 --> 00:09:00.780
and all the 1.4 billion
active users of Facebook.

00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:03.040
In the Funtwo days, well
before the efflorescence

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:07.860
of elegant services like Spotify
for music, Reddit for ideas--

00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:10.610
every time I say that
someone's like, elegant?

00:09:10.610 --> 00:09:11.570
Ideas?

00:09:11.570 --> 00:09:15.160
But anyway, Reddit for ideas,
Pinterest for collages,

00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:17.880
and Instagram for photographs,
before Steve Jobs's death,

00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.270
and even before the iPhone, the
socialization mobilification

00:09:21.270 --> 00:09:23.410
of everything, then
the move to wearables,

00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:27.380
so-called internet of things, 3D
printing and virtual reality--

00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:29.970
right then the web asserted
itself as its own culture,

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:34.450
right at the dawn of Web 2.0,
when newly expansive broadband

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.950
permitted the
dissemination of video

00:09:35.950 --> 00:09:37.720
and the rise of
social networking,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:40.510
the internet became something
more than a reformulation

00:09:40.510 --> 00:09:42.150
of the offline world.

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:44.660
With cries variously
of agony and triumph,

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.830
we had to stop pretending that
email was a handy alternative

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.510
to telephones or post.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.740
Fluid and never ending
electronic exchanges

00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:54.220
made the word communication
seem inadequate.

00:09:54.220 --> 00:09:56.580
Similarly, newspapers on
the web could no longer

00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:00.410
be considered mere
adaptations of newsprint.

00:10:00.410 --> 00:10:02.420
1992 flashback.

00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.830
This is an actual trauma
that I still can't

00:10:04.830 --> 00:10:06.830
believe I included in the book.

00:10:06.830 --> 00:10:08.540
A traumatic moment
in early adulthood

00:10:08.540 --> 00:10:11.370
came just as I was having
doubts about my first choice

00:10:11.370 --> 00:10:12.920
of career, academia.

00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:15.690
I had started a PhD program
in English in 1991 just

00:10:15.690 --> 00:10:17.680
after graduating from
college, but though I

00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.420
was supposed to be
refining my skills

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:22.440
at rigorous academic
prose, the grubbier work

00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.750
of Greil Marcus-- I understand
he just spoke here--

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:27.740
whose book "Lipstick
Traces" took seriously

00:10:27.740 --> 00:10:30.660
pop culture and a pop idiom
captured my attention.

00:10:30.660 --> 00:10:33.700
I also would try to
copy Camilla Paglia's

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:36.250
outlandish
observations about art,

00:10:36.250 --> 00:10:39.990
though they were considered
suspect in university settings.

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.090
One day my highly
traditionalist father--

00:10:42.090 --> 00:10:45.420
he's a college professor--
nailed me for this.

00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:49.820
He has a very
mid-Atlantic accent,

00:10:49.820 --> 00:10:54.060
like right squarely between
New York and London.

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:56.740
Virginia, your prose
can be a touch glib,

00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.770
or rather meretricious.

00:10:59.770 --> 00:11:01.530
What's meretricious, Dad?

00:11:01.530 --> 00:11:04.560
Oh, Virginia, come on,
meretrix, from your Latin,

00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:06.119
like a prostitute.

00:11:06.119 --> 00:11:07.450
Oh.

00:11:07.450 --> 00:11:10.770
Did you get nothing
out of Latin camp?

00:11:10.770 --> 00:11:15.060
My father called
me a prostitute.

00:11:15.060 --> 00:11:16.830
This is not an easy
dialogue to recall,

00:11:16.830 --> 00:11:18.816
but the eccentricities
of the early '90s

00:11:18.816 --> 00:11:20.190
are a useful
reference point when

00:11:20.190 --> 00:11:22.370
taking the measure of
the internet's influence.

00:11:22.370 --> 00:11:24.290
These were the days
before the web.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:26.480
The Mount Vesuvius
of digitization

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:28.500
was faintly rambling,
but most of us

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.020
were determined to
block out the noise.

00:11:31.020 --> 00:11:33.150
Sure, there was email,
but texting and tweeting

00:11:33.150 --> 00:11:37.500
had not yet made glibness-- my
kind of glibness-- compulsory.

00:11:37.500 --> 00:11:40.070
The meretrix, by other
names, had not yet

00:11:40.070 --> 00:11:42.690
become an Instagram paragon.

00:11:42.690 --> 00:11:45.900
Mandarin and emoji had not
yet left Latin in the dust

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.560
as second languages of choice.

00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:50.600
These were exciting
times, filled

00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:52.390
with these transitional
technologies,

00:11:52.390 --> 00:11:54.440
desktop published
zines and other forms

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:55.870
that presaged blogs.

00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:59.700
But cultural loyalists were
still hoping to hold on.

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:02.110
Today holding on is impossible.

00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:04.460
The tectonic shift has happened.

00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:06.130
"The New York Times"
daily newspaper

00:12:06.130 --> 00:12:10.050
and the company's news apps
are starkly disparate entities.

00:12:10.050 --> 00:12:12.920
Uber is something other than
a municipal taxi service.

00:12:12.920 --> 00:12:15.840
Airbnb is not another
kind of hotel.

00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:18.690
E-commerce at eBay,
Amazon, Etsy is not

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.590
analogous to catalog shopping.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:23.800
It has its own rules,
conventions, implications,

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:25.660
pace, and pricing.

00:12:25.660 --> 00:12:27.460
Between analog and
digital are more than

00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:29.280
differences in degree.

00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.960
Between them is a
difference in kind.

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.140
Like all new
technologies, the internet

00:12:35.140 --> 00:12:37.770
appears to represent the
world more faithfully

00:12:37.770 --> 00:12:40.370
than technologies
that preceded it.

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.460
And the internet is an
extraordinarily seductive

00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:45.150
representation of the world.

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.700
We've never seen a
work of art like it.

00:12:47.700 --> 00:12:49.752
That is the book's
central contention,

00:12:49.752 --> 00:12:51.960
that the internet is a
massive and collaborative work

00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.440
of realist art.

00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:56.240
And moreover, it's so
beguiling a realist showpiece,

00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:59.500
and so readily confused with
reality, that books about it

00:12:59.500 --> 00:13:02.920
call themselves books about
business, politics, or science,

00:13:02.920 --> 00:13:05.980
the reigning bywords
for reality itself.

00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.360
That is a mistake.

00:13:07.360 --> 00:13:08.980
Digital forms are
best illuminated

00:13:08.980 --> 00:13:10.710
by cultural
criticism, which uses

00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:13.010
the tools of art
and literary theory

00:13:13.010 --> 00:13:15.730
to make sense of the
internet's glorious illusion,

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:18.240
that the internet is life.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:20.470
Because of course the
internet is not life.

00:13:20.470 --> 00:13:23.860
It's a highly artificial regime
with tight rules and rituals

00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:26.940
that organize its text,
music, and images.

00:13:26.940 --> 00:13:29.360
That's why the internet
becomes more deeply meaningful

00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:31.770
and moved when read
as an aesthetic object

00:13:31.770 --> 00:13:36.130
than lived or reported on as
firsthand human experience.

00:13:36.130 --> 00:13:38.650
The human experience is art.

00:13:38.650 --> 00:13:41.310
That human experience is art,
where art is considered closer

00:13:41.310 --> 00:13:43.400
to a game than to a deception.

00:13:43.400 --> 00:13:46.150
Our proxies in this
game are our avatars,

00:13:46.150 --> 00:13:48.370
the sum total of all
the profile pictures,

00:13:48.370 --> 00:13:51.210
message board communiques,
Snapchat videos,

00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.250
and all other artifacts
of text, image, and sound

00:13:54.250 --> 00:13:57.720
that we add to the internet and
attach to our various handles.

00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.470
The game itself in
artwork is without doubt

00:14:00.470 --> 00:14:03.320
what video gamers call a
massively multiplayer online

00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:05.170
role-playing game.

00:14:05.170 --> 00:14:08.410
It's funny, because I'm having
to cut things out so that I

00:14:08.410 --> 00:14:11.910
don't over explain to
all of you-- I mean,

00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:14.500
you know what a massively
multiplayer online role-playing

00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:16.420
game is, but sometimes
people don't.

00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:21.220
So I'll save you my very labored
explanation of what they are.

00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.170
Digital life in its current
extremely visual, social,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:28.150
portable, and global incarnation
rewards certain values,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.780
and they're not the ones
many of us grew up with.

00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.240
Engagement, emotional
expression, liberalism,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:35.690
tolerance, self-knowledge,
irony-- these values

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:38.090
of the '70s lost a
great deal of urgency

00:14:38.090 --> 00:14:41.200
at the turn of the millennium.

00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:43.000
So I felt that I
was trying to learn

00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.430
a certain new set of
values, a new aesthetic,

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:50.924
and a new politics-- a new way
of being, a new modus vivendi.

00:14:50.924 --> 00:14:52.340
And while I was
trying to learn, I

00:14:52.340 --> 00:14:54.390
practiced the
finger work required

00:14:54.390 --> 00:14:58.180
by my laptop, my BlackBerry,
and eventually my iPhone.

00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:00.950
And what writers workers,
teachers, parents, students,

00:15:00.950 --> 00:15:03.270
artists, and
companies all appeared

00:15:03.270 --> 00:15:05.370
to be trying to learn,
too, these new skills

00:15:05.370 --> 00:15:09.830
and interpretive methods, many
of which didn't have names yet.

00:15:09.830 --> 00:15:14.000
Just as one example,
when the Funtwo video

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:17.500
and some other videos from
YouTube and other early video

00:15:17.500 --> 00:15:20.930
sites came over my desk, I
was writing about television

00:15:20.930 --> 00:15:24.460
at the "Times," and as I said,
I thought, oh, maybe this

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.190
is something interesting
that I could write about.

00:15:27.190 --> 00:15:30.120
My more senior
colleague in TV got

00:15:30.120 --> 00:15:32.660
to write about "The Sopranos"
premiere and "Six Feet Under"

00:15:32.660 --> 00:15:33.760
finale.

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.340
And so I was sort of writing a
lot about reality television.

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:40.250
And so I was looking for
a way to make my name,

00:15:40.250 --> 00:15:42.780
write something exciting
about something new.

00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:46.452
So I saw this online
video and I thought,

00:15:46.452 --> 00:15:47.660
you know what would be great?

00:15:47.660 --> 00:15:50.180
"The Times" could
host all this--

00:15:50.180 --> 00:15:51.660
I called it internet television.

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:54.664
I still have a folder on my
desk for internet television,

00:15:54.664 --> 00:15:56.080
because I was a
television critic,

00:15:56.080 --> 00:15:58.040
so I wanted to persuade
everyone that I could now write

00:15:58.040 --> 00:15:59.123
about internet television.

00:15:59.123 --> 00:16:01.140
It would be like cable.

00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:03.550
So I had this idea
that "The Times"

00:16:03.550 --> 00:16:06.700
would host a video a day,
all the video that would ever

00:16:06.700 --> 00:16:07.710
appear on the internet.

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:09.600
We would host it on
our site, and then

00:16:09.600 --> 00:16:11.800
I would write a capsule
review of each one,

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:13.774
and it would just
be this daily thing,

00:16:13.774 --> 00:16:15.440
because I thought
that we would probably

00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.210
see about one video a
day on the internet.

00:16:19.210 --> 00:16:22.450
You guys know the
numbers that you do.

00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:28.150
So after dusting off hundreds
and then thousands of videos

00:16:28.150 --> 00:16:30.600
on YouTube-- this is another
thing I think about YouTube--

00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:34.890
you know, art forms like color
field painting or punk music

00:16:34.890 --> 00:16:37.310
usually start in one place,
and they have names attached

00:16:37.310 --> 00:16:38.660
and they grow outward.

00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:41.450
YouTube, it was like
discovering a lost civilization.

00:16:41.450 --> 00:16:45.620
I mean, I should talk
again to Hurley and Chen

00:16:45.620 --> 00:16:48.810
about this-- I know the
first one that was up there,

00:16:48.810 --> 00:16:51.040
but I don't know
at what point they

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.620
started to get
close to the numbers

00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:55.290
that YouTube has
now for uploading.

00:16:55.290 --> 00:16:57.765
I mean, it seemed as
though there was never

00:16:57.765 --> 00:16:59.890
a time that there weren't
at least a million videos

00:16:59.890 --> 00:17:04.430
on that site, that you weren't
looking at three one day.

00:17:04.430 --> 00:17:08.550
And so it was like dusting off
these hundreds and thousands

00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:10.770
of videos and seeing
the civilization

00:17:10.770 --> 00:17:13.050
that they composed.

00:17:13.050 --> 00:17:16.579
Online video isn't a new
art form, like punk music.

00:17:16.579 --> 00:17:18.890
Instead, the art of the
internet and its rules

00:17:18.890 --> 00:17:22.040
came into view all at
once and fully formed.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.650
All over the world amateurs
had apparently spent the years

00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.780
since the birth of camcorders in
1982 and digital video in 1986

00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:32.130
shooting, producing,
collecting, and transferring

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:36.530
home movies, video art, pet
and baby videos, surveillance

00:17:36.530 --> 00:17:41.890
videos, including some that
showed police, interpersonal,

00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:46.380
and corporate misdeeds, music
performances, ads, trailers,

00:17:46.380 --> 00:17:48.430
sermons, lectures,
comedy sketches, theater

00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:51.150
scenes, pornography, magic
tricks, athletic stunts,

00:17:51.150 --> 00:17:55.640
pranks, medical anomalies,
virtual tours, news broadcasts.

00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.000
All of these were just waiting
around needing an audience.

00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.450
Now by 2016, more than
100 hours of video

00:18:02.450 --> 00:18:05.140
are uploaded every
minute to YouTube,

00:18:05.140 --> 00:18:09.080
hours that come with a dizzying
range of styles, themes,

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:10.490
and provenances.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:12.310
Many of them had
clearly been produced

00:18:12.310 --> 00:18:14.860
well before the possibility
of online broadcasting ever

00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:20.300
existed, the 1950 coronation of
Queen Elizabeth, for example.

00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.960
The first videos
mounted to YouTube

00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:23.850
included a scene of
civil disobedience

00:18:23.850 --> 00:18:27.040
shot in a bus in Singapore, a
monologue by a Best Buy clerk,

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:31.930
and fully 14 short movies of
mammals playing with shoelaces.

00:18:31.930 --> 00:18:33.970
Every single one of them
zinged around the web

00:18:33.970 --> 00:18:36.530
and collectively attracted
far more passionate responses

00:18:36.530 --> 00:18:39.730
than the multimillion
dollar slates of new network

00:18:39.730 --> 00:18:42.790
television that I
regularly reviewed.

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:46.820
The internet favors, speed,
accuracy, wit, prolificacy--

00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:49.470
someone just corrected my
pronunciation-- prolificacy,

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:50.540
and versatility.

00:18:50.540 --> 00:18:54.710
But it also favors integrity,
mindfulness, and wise action.

00:18:54.710 --> 00:18:56.720
For however alien in
appearance, the internet

00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:59.110
is a cultural object
visually on a continuum

00:18:59.110 --> 00:19:01.840
with the cultural
artifacts that preceded it.

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:03.740
It's not a break with history.

00:19:03.740 --> 00:19:04.770
Neither is it progress.

00:19:04.770 --> 00:19:08.260
It's just what
happened to be next.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:10.510
The internet's responsiveness
to critical tools,

00:19:10.510 --> 00:19:13.720
the kind used by English
majors, historians, bloggers,

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:15.790
readers of every
stripe, including

00:19:15.790 --> 00:19:19.370
rogues like commenters,
trolls, and kneejerk tweeters,

00:19:19.370 --> 00:19:24.360
has been elucidated in the
stuff that I've studied,

00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:28.596
Baroque audiovisual projects by
composers and sound designers.

00:19:28.596 --> 00:19:29.970
The hallmarks of
internet culture

00:19:29.970 --> 00:19:33.710
come through in experiments like
Netflix and Amazon Originals,

00:19:33.710 --> 00:19:35.770
arguments and reports
serialized on Twitter,

00:19:35.770 --> 00:19:39.920
podcasts like NPR's "Serial,"
and the new media franchises

00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.282
of reality TV heroines.

00:19:46.450 --> 00:19:49.040
Anyone can witness this from
the front row, the emergence

00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:52.235
of a new hierarchy of values at
Wikipedia, Facebook, Twitter,

00:19:52.235 --> 00:19:57.320
G-- here, Instagram, Spotify,
Snapchat, Skype, and so on.

00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.530
But companies rise and fall
on the strength and value

00:19:59.530 --> 00:20:03.300
to advertisers of what we at
Yahoo News-- where I covered

00:20:03.300 --> 00:20:06.080
digital politics during
the 2012 election--

00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:08.630
we used to optimistically
mystically their assets--

00:20:08.630 --> 00:20:11.270
visual, auditory, or textual.

00:20:11.270 --> 00:20:13.130
At least they
weren't liabilities

00:20:13.130 --> 00:20:14.500
while I was making them.

00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.400
These assets are nearly
always ironic, cartoonish,

00:20:17.400 --> 00:20:19.710
or dramatic extensions
of established and even

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.270
ancient art forms, aphoristic
poetry suitable for Twitter,

00:20:23.270 --> 00:20:26.929
painterly images for Instagram,
polemics, essays, and reports

00:20:26.929 --> 00:20:27.470
for Facebook.

00:20:30.240 --> 00:20:33.029
The web represents a
grand emotional, sensory,

00:20:33.029 --> 00:20:34.570
and intellectual
adventure for anyone

00:20:34.570 --> 00:20:36.500
willing to explore it actively.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:39.920
Alarmist tracks that warn about
how the web endangers culture

00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:42.270
or coarsens civilization
miss the point

00:20:42.270 --> 00:20:44.680
that the same was said,
in turn, about theater,

00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:48.530
lyric poetry, the novel,
film, and television.

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:51.820
Having written about television
for such a long time,

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:54.579
I got really used to
writing about something

00:20:54.579 --> 00:20:56.370
that was treated as an
art at "The New York

00:20:56.370 --> 00:20:58.960
Times" on the culture pages--
so I sat next to someone that

00:20:58.960 --> 00:21:03.820
wrote about opera, music,
museum shows, books--

00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.470
but treated as a
public health hazard

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:07.350
in the rest of the newspaper.

00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:11.730
So this is not uncommon,
and in some ways,

00:21:11.730 --> 00:21:15.910
I like that what we do, what
we immerse ourselves in, is

00:21:15.910 --> 00:21:19.900
considered, in some ways,
like a neurotixin or disease,

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:23.290
that we're addicted to it.

00:21:23.290 --> 00:21:24.680
Things that make
you feel truant,

00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:27.013
like you're doing something
that you shouldn't be doing,

00:21:27.013 --> 00:21:30.220
that tends to be-- as Bob
and I were discussing--

00:21:30.220 --> 00:21:32.760
those vulgar art forms
tend to be thriving.

00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:34.350
You know that an
art form, I think,

00:21:34.350 --> 00:21:37.740
is in trouble when there are
suddenly MFA programs in it.

00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:41.970
So it'll be time to sell
Instagram, short sell

00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:44.940
Instagram, when there's
suddenly an MFA program

00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:46.170
on the art of the selfie.

00:21:48.890 --> 00:21:51.360
The internet is the
great masterpiece

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.030
of human civilization.

00:21:53.030 --> 00:21:56.020
As an artifact it challenges
the pyramid, the aqueduct,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:59.210
the highway, the novel, the
newspaper, the nation state,

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:03.190
the Magna Carta, Easter
Island, Stonehenge.

00:22:03.190 --> 00:22:05.200
Anyone want to argue?

00:22:05.200 --> 00:22:08.250
Agriculture, the feature film,
the automobile, the telephone,

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:10.760
the Chanel suit, the airplane,
the pencil, the book,

00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.890
the printing press, the
radio, the realist painting,

00:22:13.890 --> 00:22:17.480
the abstract painting, the birth
control pill, the elevator,

00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:19.550
and cooked meat.

00:22:19.550 --> 00:22:23.150
As an idea, it
rivals monotheism.

00:22:23.150 --> 00:22:24.770
Just as in Nietzsche's
scheme, man

00:22:24.770 --> 00:22:26.490
created science,
which in turn killed

00:22:26.490 --> 00:22:30.150
god, analog culture--
that's books, clocks, film,

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.510
industrial machines,
the compasses and timers

00:22:32.510 --> 00:22:34.040
of scientific method.

00:22:34.040 --> 00:22:35.890
Those things created
digital culture,

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:39.380
and now digital culture
has superseded them.

00:22:39.380 --> 00:22:41.980
It was quick, that
supersession, and now it's over.

00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.220
But where are we?

00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:46.640
Magic is a word Apple
vigorously embraced,

00:22:46.640 --> 00:22:49.860
and it's a term of
art from engineers.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.330
I don't want to
summarize because I

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:54.420
know I'm in company that is
probably above my head on this,

00:22:54.420 --> 00:22:57.620
but as I understand it, a
program is magic to the extent

00:22:57.620 --> 00:23:01.460
that it makes what would be
very complicated processes

00:23:01.460 --> 00:23:03.360
seem easy.

00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:05.780
And the word loss
in the title comes

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:09.920
from the problem of
lossy compression,

00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:14.410
so that the MP3 form of
representing a musical signal

00:23:14.410 --> 00:23:18.020
tends to compress that signal,
to thin it out somehow.

00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:19.320
And it loses something.

00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.940
What that thing is, is what I
want to take the measure of.

00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:25.340
So in digitization,
digitization is lossy.

00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:27.110
This civilization is lossy.

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:29.380
Its effort to represent
and reproduce what

00:23:29.380 --> 00:23:32.620
went before it loses something.

00:23:32.620 --> 00:23:38.350
And that's what the loss part
of the book attempts to size up.

00:23:38.350 --> 00:23:40.690
35 years ago, when I
first discovered it,

00:23:40.690 --> 00:23:42.870
the internet wasn't
easy to find.

00:23:42.870 --> 00:23:46.580
It wasn't a user friendly retail
franchise as the web is now.

00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:50.470
It was a nervous back office
full of furtive clerics.

00:23:50.470 --> 00:23:52.030
You stumbled in.

00:23:52.030 --> 00:23:54.570
While computer hardware
and software of the 1970s

00:23:54.570 --> 00:23:56.404
were the work of
sophisticated engineers

00:23:56.404 --> 00:23:58.570
who pressed computers into
the service of everything

00:23:58.570 --> 00:24:01.970
from music to word processing,
architecture and film making,

00:24:01.970 --> 00:24:03.850
the slow and awkward
networks in those days

00:24:03.850 --> 00:24:05.760
had limited application.

00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:08.650
These were the so-called Eve
networks, inspired largely

00:24:08.650 --> 00:24:12.170
by ARPANET, the landmark-- I was
going to tell you what that is,

00:24:12.170 --> 00:24:13.123
but I think you know.

00:24:13.123 --> 00:24:15.170
Logically, the internet
in its early days

00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:18.110
was kind of a diversion for
Cold War intelligence types

00:24:18.110 --> 00:24:19.920
and academics.

00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:21.920
But it was possible
to stumble into it,

00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.560
and I know because
at nine years old,

00:24:23.560 --> 00:24:25.870
I was one of the
stumbling years.

00:24:25.870 --> 00:24:28.610
Excalibur was an early
social networking technology

00:24:28.610 --> 00:24:30.270
developed at Dartmouth College.

00:24:30.270 --> 00:24:32.630
It was the heyday of
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:38.020
It was 1979, and in that day,
the vaguely King Arthur theme

00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:42.050
appealed to both hackers
and tweens like me.

00:24:42.050 --> 00:24:46.040
Now Excalibur's real purpose
was to facilitate communication

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:48.550
among several academic and
scientific institutions

00:24:48.550 --> 00:24:50.970
that shared Dartmouth
mainframe computer.

00:24:50.970 --> 00:24:53.990
It was one of those
big, heaving rhinos

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:59.120
that, in a cage of bulletproof
plexiglass, sighed and rattled.

00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:01.280
Every day a few
hundred people dialed

00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.590
into that mainframe for an alien
signal like [SCREECHING SOUND].

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:08.897
I loved that sound.

00:25:08.897 --> 00:25:10.980
I mean, when I first heard
that sound, I was like,

00:25:10.980 --> 00:25:13.300
that's all the information
in the world just coming

00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.210
in to my life.

00:25:16.210 --> 00:25:18.810
We would fit our receivers
into these acoustic couplers

00:25:18.810 --> 00:25:20.880
like people into kayaks.

00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.000
As a townie pre-teen, I
hacked in with the help

00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.880
of some shaggy, kind
Dartmouth students

00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.870
who called themselves sysprogs.

00:25:26.870 --> 00:25:30.030
In those days, Dartmouth sysprog
sounded tantalizing to me,

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:34.006
the way lead singer sounded
to some of my classmates.

00:25:34.006 --> 00:25:35.880
John Kemeny, then the
president of Dartmouth,

00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.890
had co-written the computer
language BASIC in 1964,

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:41.490
inspiring a generation of
student programmers who got

00:25:41.490 --> 00:25:43.340
called Kemeny's kids.

00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:47.250
They built this extraordinary
Dartmouth timesharing system.

00:25:47.250 --> 00:25:49.390
Most of them are out here now.

00:25:49.390 --> 00:25:51.810
The sysprogs of the
1970s and early '80s

00:25:51.810 --> 00:25:55.440
also tended this mainframe as
it shook and rattled in its cage

00:25:55.440 --> 00:25:58.540
on the edge of Dartmouth's
colonial campus.

00:25:58.540 --> 00:26:01.240
So with some friends, I found
my way to their computer center.

00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.760
Our trick was to
tell our parents

00:26:02.760 --> 00:26:06.620
that there was no way we
would be able to work for NASA

00:26:06.620 --> 00:26:08.567
unless we hung out
with these guys all day

00:26:08.567 --> 00:26:09.900
and played Dungeons and Dragons.

00:26:09.900 --> 00:26:16.660
It was a pretty good little
scam we had going on.

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.560
It's 10 years after
the moon landing,

00:26:18.560 --> 00:26:21.220
so anything that you
could tell your parents

00:26:21.220 --> 00:26:25.730
to help you get to the moon,
they were happy to oblige.

00:26:25.730 --> 00:26:28.930
With some friends, I found
my way to the computer center

00:26:28.930 --> 00:26:31.140
to talk about BASIC.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:35.150
Kemeny had taught rudimentary
BASIC at the local Yankee

00:26:35.150 --> 00:26:37.600
school children, presumably
to win the freedom

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:42.620
to pursue his non-Yankee plan
for ARPANET on the Connecticut.

00:26:42.620 --> 00:26:44.300
To mollify our
parents, we told them

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.440
we were going to work for NASA.

00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.610
But the little girls of 10 and
11 who stormed Excalibur never

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.050
made tech history.

00:26:51.050 --> 00:26:52.450
That worked for us at the time.

00:26:52.450 --> 00:26:55.100
All the better to enter the
shadowy world of Excalibur,

00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.680
and especially an
addictive live chat feature

00:26:57.680 --> 00:27:00.520
called Conference XYZ,
without being noticed.

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:03.960
Conference XYZ amplified
Excalibur's fantasy element.

00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:07.270
Each convocation had levels
and a self-anointed master

00:27:07.270 --> 00:27:09.690
who could banish
chatters he disliked.

00:27:09.690 --> 00:27:11.720
So if you signed on
early in the morning,

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:13.550
you'd have to get a code.

00:27:13.550 --> 00:27:17.150
It went off at night,
like TV, but you would try

00:27:17.150 --> 00:27:18.580
to get up early and sign early.

00:27:18.580 --> 00:27:21.900
And you needed the code of
the day to be able to sign on.

00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:24.770
So we'd have to call each
other and tell each other that.

00:27:24.770 --> 00:27:26.760
And the sysprogs would set that.

00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:29.540
So if you got on first and you
were the master-- oh my gosh,

00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:30.800
you've been there.

00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:33.410
Did I see you on Excalibur?

00:27:33.410 --> 00:27:35.690
I was Athena.

00:27:35.690 --> 00:27:37.000
I was nine.

00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.310
So you would sign
on, and then you

00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:44.987
could just banish
anyone you didn't

00:27:44.987 --> 00:27:46.070
like if they were talking.

00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:48.278
I mean, I would be fun to
do this on Twitter someday,

00:27:48.278 --> 00:27:51.240
because people would
talk in public space

00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:53.100
and just reply all.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:56.520
And if they swore, and
you would always say back

00:27:56.520 --> 00:27:58.590
to that-- there was a
macro for keep it clean,

00:27:58.590 --> 00:28:02.050
folks, for some reason,
keep it clean, folks.

00:28:02.050 --> 00:28:04.810
But also, these guys at the
Merchant Marines Academy

00:28:04.810 --> 00:28:06.280
would write in all caps.

00:28:06.280 --> 00:28:08.665
And for some reason that meant
that they were ideologues.

00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:10.290
Even if they were
saying normal things,

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:15.002
just writing in all caps was
a way to get yourself killed.

00:28:15.002 --> 00:28:16.960
But then sometimes one
of the Merchant Marines,

00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.824
one of the caps people,
would be the master.

00:28:18.824 --> 00:28:20.490
He would have gotten
the code, and you'd

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.850
be like, oh, it's going to be
such a bad day, because he's

00:28:25.850 --> 00:28:29.140
going to hush all
the people we like.

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:32.504
You know, I went on because
I was nine, 10, 11, 12.

00:28:32.504 --> 00:28:34.420
I just couldn't get heard
at the dinner table,

00:28:34.420 --> 00:28:37.740
and I had some very interesting
ideas about Reaganomics

00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.700
that I wanted to share with
anyone who would listen.

00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:46.850
And you know, I don't think
it's unlike how lots of us

00:28:46.850 --> 00:28:47.960
come to the internet now.

00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:52.110
You feel too young or too
old or too fat or too black

00:28:52.110 --> 00:28:53.550
or whatever for a social life.

00:28:53.550 --> 00:28:59.550
And so if you're uncomfortable
in physical space-- you know,

00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.760
I wasn't athletic, and
I was a good writer.

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.770
So I could be a superstar.

00:29:03.770 --> 00:29:05.360
I could be Athena.

00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:11.414
And it was extraordinary
how fast this thing grew.

00:29:11.414 --> 00:29:13.830
There was an article in "The
Atlantic" maybe 10 years ago.

00:29:13.830 --> 00:29:16.020
But it said that
every time they find

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.890
bones of primitive
people, primitive man,

00:29:18.890 --> 00:29:23.390
nearby those bones are the bones
of a domesticated wolf, a dog,

00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:27.987
that there's never been humans
without dogs really nearby.

00:29:27.987 --> 00:29:29.570
And one of the
contentions of the book

00:29:29.570 --> 00:29:32.090
is, there's never been
engineering without culture

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:32.820
right next to it.

00:29:32.820 --> 00:29:35.820
So there's never been a time
that people were creating

00:29:35.820 --> 00:29:39.850
the internet that they weren't
also posing as Apollo, Athena,

00:29:39.850 --> 00:29:43.734
or whatever, to chat with
each other about end runs,

00:29:43.734 --> 00:29:45.650
but ultimately about
anything, about what they

00:29:45.650 --> 00:29:46.750
were having for lunch.

00:29:46.750 --> 00:29:50.790
So I bypassed the part where
I could have learned to code.

00:29:50.790 --> 00:29:52.280
And the four other
people that were

00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:55.330
interested in John
Kemeny's talk-- all boys--

00:29:55.330 --> 00:29:57.160
didn't moon for the sysprogs.

00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.280
They went off and
actually learned something

00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.040
and probably work for NASA now.

00:30:01.040 --> 00:30:05.690
But yeah, so this is
a book-length effort

00:30:05.690 --> 00:30:10.110
to justify my decision to be
Athena, and not learn Fortran

00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:12.560
or whatever.

00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:17.940
In any case, the culture
that we were creating-- well,

00:30:17.940 --> 00:30:20.329
by the time I turned
13, I was confident

00:30:20.329 --> 00:30:22.120
the way I would later
be confident that I'd

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.020
seen every single video online.

00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:29.380
I was confident that I knew
every single person online.

00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:35.020
I just was like, Apollo,
Bumblebee, me, it was a list.

00:30:35.020 --> 00:30:36.802
I had 100 of us in my head.

00:30:36.802 --> 00:30:39.260
My parents couldn't have guessed
that I was meeting anyone.

00:30:39.260 --> 00:30:42.270
They just saw me sitting hour
after hour at a computer.

00:30:42.270 --> 00:30:45.630
The computer was Zenith
Z-19, a dumb terminal.

00:30:45.630 --> 00:30:47.200
It was like a
ChromeBook in the sense

00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:49.670
that without the mainframe,
there was nothing in it.

00:30:49.670 --> 00:30:51.910
Just had to dial into it.

00:30:51.910 --> 00:30:55.470
And I just would
stare at that thing.

00:30:55.470 --> 00:30:57.440
You guys can remember
it from "War Games."

00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.120
It's like these green
phosphor letters in the front,

00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:04.840
and then this just deep yonder,
just dark space behind it.

00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:08.520
And I just would peer into
that space and just wonder what

00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:09.620
was out there.

00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.410
People were saying things in the
foreground about Reaganomics,

00:31:12.410 --> 00:31:15.410
about Dungeons and Dragons,
about Led Zeppelin-- huge topic

00:31:15.410 --> 00:31:19.360
of conversation on
Conference XYZ-- runes.

00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:22.520
And I would just
try to speculate,

00:31:22.520 --> 00:31:23.840
how are they getting in here?

00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:27.960
What in that squeal crash
sound is bringing all this

00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.150
into my life?

00:31:29.150 --> 00:31:31.380
And there was a huge
amount of projection.

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:34.660
I see it in my kids when they
look at a Minecraft screen.

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:37.010
It's like practically
illegible to me.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.910
It just seems so abstract.

00:31:38.910 --> 00:31:41.342
And yet when I hear
them talk to each other,

00:31:41.342 --> 00:31:43.300
they say-- there are not
enough of these videos

00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:45.800
on YouTube, by the way, of kids
playing Minecraft and talking

00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:46.150
about it.

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:48.441
But you know, they're looking
at something-- just looks

00:31:48.441 --> 00:31:52.470
like this kind of beigey,
greenie, ochre blur--

00:31:52.470 --> 00:31:54.890
and saying to each
other, like, we're

00:31:54.890 --> 00:31:58.300
going to need a tribunal
because you killed my sheep.

00:31:58.300 --> 00:32:00.050
That's actually a real thing.

00:32:00.050 --> 00:32:02.830
And I mean, they might as
well be looking at a brick,

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:05.990
to me, for as much
sense as it makes.

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:08.330
And I was having this
incredibly emotional experience

00:32:08.330 --> 00:32:10.930
in essentially looking
at this dark screen

00:32:10.930 --> 00:32:14.040
and really coming of age.

00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:19.350
I got off because I
finally met someone.

00:32:19.350 --> 00:32:22.240
His screen name was
John G, so he had

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.480
a kind of normal screen name.

00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:27.730
And I told him that
I was 14, and he

00:32:27.730 --> 00:32:28.970
was 18, Dartmouth student.

00:32:28.970 --> 00:32:31.220
And he asked me to go
to a bonfire with him

00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:32.855
and play with light
sticks or whatever.

00:32:32.855 --> 00:32:34.480
So I went on my first
date with someone

00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:35.420
that I had met on there.

00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:37.630
And I was really excited,
and I told my real friends

00:32:37.630 --> 00:32:40.046
the next day that I had been
out with this 18-year-old guy

00:32:40.046 --> 00:32:41.680
and I was really excited.

00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:43.570
And it's kind of
like, maybe, when

00:32:43.570 --> 00:32:45.500
you meet someone on
Bumble now, or Tinder

00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.145
or whatever, that you
don't want the question,

00:32:49.145 --> 00:32:50.020
how did you meet him?

00:32:50.020 --> 00:32:52.460
You just want to delay
that for a little bit.

00:32:52.460 --> 00:32:55.750
But anyway, Hallie Davis asked
me, how did you meet him?

00:32:55.750 --> 00:32:58.410
And I was like, just
this game that I play.

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:00.350
And she was like, is
that on the computer?

00:33:00.350 --> 00:33:05.290
And I said yes, and
she said, desperado.

00:33:05.290 --> 00:33:08.780
And suddenly, I was like, I will
never look at a computer again.

00:33:08.780 --> 00:33:09.360
And I didn't.

00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:12.220
I closed it down.

00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:13.800
The story of early
computer networks

00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.930
has most often been told as a
technology and business story.

00:33:16.930 --> 00:33:18.990
But like the internet
today, Conference XYZ

00:33:18.990 --> 00:33:24.500
was not an engineering
experiment as much

00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.010
as an immersive experience.

00:33:26.010 --> 00:33:27.860
What mesmerized me
and its other users

00:33:27.860 --> 00:33:31.050
were its cadences and
its vocabulary, its vibe.

00:33:31.050 --> 00:33:33.570
On some level, while we
were seeking connection

00:33:33.570 --> 00:33:36.360
and community, we were also
helping to build a culture,

00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:40.130
and today I see that
culture writ large online.

00:33:40.130 --> 00:33:44.160
All the same little
cultural flourishes, like

00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.630
are you going to write in
all lower case, or all caps,

00:33:46.630 --> 00:33:52.550
or mixed cases, or use little
hyphens instead of em dashes,

00:33:52.550 --> 00:33:57.880
or make Reply All errors.

00:33:57.880 --> 00:34:00.000
I just remember it was
like this rite of passage

00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:03.270
that you were going to mess up
with RA, Reply All sometime,

00:34:03.270 --> 00:34:07.870
instead of replying right to the
person, and get hazed for it,

00:34:07.870 --> 00:34:09.920
and learn.

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.090
Conference XYZ pretty
much folded in 1986.

00:34:13.090 --> 00:34:16.389
For years I half-repressed
thoughts of Excalibur.

00:34:16.389 --> 00:34:18.480
It would come back
to me in fragments,

00:34:18.480 --> 00:34:21.810
the odd jargon we evolved, the
hot feeling of being watched,

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.340
the invective, the
jokes, the speed.

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:26.199
The highly collaborative
project had

00:34:26.199 --> 00:34:28.310
been a spontaneous
creation of a scene

00:34:28.310 --> 00:34:30.940
and a modus vivendi,
an entire culture.

00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.909
Had we really done all that,
and was it really gone?

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:36.540
It was not gone.

00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.380
What I thought was the end of a
short detour from regular life

00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.380
was actually the beginning of
the biggest cultural phenomenon

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:44.270
of our lifetime.

00:34:44.270 --> 00:34:47.650
If it's fair to say
anything changed everything,

00:34:47.650 --> 00:34:49.560
it's fair to say so
about the internet.

00:34:49.560 --> 00:34:51.790
At stake in this cultural
transformation are the way

00:34:51.790 --> 00:34:55.782
we live, think, love, talk,
and fight across the globe.

00:34:55.782 --> 00:34:57.490
The internet is
entrenched, and it's time

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.490
to understand it not as
a curiosity or an entry

00:35:00.490 --> 00:35:02.530
in the annals of
technology or business,

00:35:02.530 --> 00:35:05.270
but an integral part of our
humanity, the latest and most

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:09.680
powerful extension NS expression
of the project of being human.

00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.122
Thanks.

00:35:11.122 --> 00:35:16.769
[APPLAUSE]

00:35:16.769 --> 00:35:17.310
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:35:17.310 --> 00:35:18.480
Thanks so much for coming.

00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:19.610
VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN: Thanks.

00:35:19.610 --> 00:35:22.500
AUDIENCE: I'm particularly
interested in why people

00:35:22.500 --> 00:35:24.630
will take the time
to post on YouTube

00:35:24.630 --> 00:35:26.330
and build up their
audiences, especially

00:35:26.330 --> 00:35:29.240
as it relates to
sharing expertise,

00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:32.810
especially if that expertise
isn't socially credentialized.

00:35:32.810 --> 00:35:36.980
So to them, the expertise
is like how to use Snapchat

00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:40.360
or how to clear the
cache on your device.

00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:42.270
And so I'm curious
what you think

00:35:42.270 --> 00:35:47.640
are the elements of a successful
atmosphere that encourages

00:35:47.640 --> 00:35:49.020
that type of behavior.

00:35:49.020 --> 00:35:50.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:35:50.070 --> 00:35:53.850
I couldn't tell that-- I thought
that Funtwo, Jeong-Hyun Lim's

00:35:53.850 --> 00:35:57.080
video, when I first saw the
guitar video-- do people

00:35:57.080 --> 00:36:00.050
know what I'm talking
about, that video?

00:36:00.050 --> 00:36:00.550
Wow.

00:36:00.550 --> 00:36:01.050
All right.

00:36:01.050 --> 00:36:03.310
Well, in that place
where all the conference

00:36:03.310 --> 00:36:05.260
rooms are named
after viral videos,

00:36:05.260 --> 00:36:07.310
forget about Coke and Mentos.

00:36:07.310 --> 00:36:11.910
They were talking about
guitar, lower case G.

00:36:11.910 --> 00:36:13.600
I thought that
was a music video.

00:36:13.600 --> 00:36:16.040
I read it as a music
video when I first saw it.

00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:18.420
And when I finally
tracked him down

00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:22.970
through Naver, this Korean
social networking site,

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:24.290
I actually saw him in person.

00:36:24.290 --> 00:36:26.880
He's a missionary, and
he came to New York

00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:30.060
and played that
piece in Astor Place,

00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:32.620
with his cap pulled in
hopes of being recognized.

00:36:32.620 --> 00:36:35.355
And a couple people were
like, that's that kid.

00:36:35.355 --> 00:36:37.480
And he played with the
Red Hot Chili Peppers.

00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:39.750
He had kind of a career.

00:36:39.750 --> 00:36:42.580
So he explained to me that
it was a how to video.

00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:45.120
And it was a how to video,
and this is astounding.

00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.820
So downstairs in
his living room,

00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:49.140
he would practice
violin and piano,

00:36:49.140 --> 00:36:51.140
which he was expected to do.

00:36:51.140 --> 00:36:53.220
But upstairs in
his room, he wanted

00:36:53.220 --> 00:36:56.350
to do this kind of shred
guitar that was in a Baroque--

00:36:56.350 --> 00:36:58.420
but that's Pachelbel's
Canon piece.

00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:01.450
So it was like
Baroque chamber music

00:37:01.450 --> 00:37:03.810
that he had been doing
downstairs, but then upstairs

00:37:03.810 --> 00:37:05.700
with headphones
into this webcam.

00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:08.600
So he became-- there's a
Japanese term, hikikomori.

00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:12.730
It's [? charisma hiki. ?]
It's a famous shut-in.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:14.550
So a person that
doesn't leave their room

00:37:14.550 --> 00:37:16.480
but becomes famous
on the internet.

00:37:16.480 --> 00:37:18.779
And so he was sort of that.

00:37:18.779 --> 00:37:20.320
He had all these
followers and people

00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:23.790
that were interested in
his version of this thing.

00:37:23.790 --> 00:37:26.250
But he's extremely
shy, and a lot

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.750
of virtuoso guitarists
who hide behind makeup

00:37:28.750 --> 00:37:31.110
or hair or a bucket--
there's bucket head.

00:37:31.110 --> 00:37:33.590
And he pulls his
cap over his face

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:35.115
almost entirely while he plays.

00:37:35.115 --> 00:37:36.240
So you can see his fingers.

00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.406
So when I talked to him I
said, why did you do that?

00:37:38.406 --> 00:37:43.570
And he said, I wanted to show
people my way of playing,

00:37:43.570 --> 00:37:45.570
and I also wanted
feedback on it.

00:37:45.570 --> 00:37:48.350
The reason that chamber music
existed in the first place--

00:37:48.350 --> 00:37:49.940
chambers, so that
you don't just hear

00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:52.100
the music recorded,
because the hope is you'll

00:37:52.100 --> 00:37:53.390
be able to do it, too.

00:37:53.390 --> 00:37:56.300
So you want to come up close
and see the instruments

00:37:56.300 --> 00:37:58.200
and see how people
are doing, how they're

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.754
playing the harpsichord so
you might be able to reproduce

00:38:00.754 --> 00:38:01.420
the finger work.

00:38:01.420 --> 00:38:03.690
And you can't do
that at a distance

00:38:03.690 --> 00:38:06.710
if you're seeing it on stage
at the Beacon or whatever.

00:38:06.710 --> 00:38:10.870
So in a weird way,
he brought back--

00:38:10.870 --> 00:38:13.907
something that complicated,
that he brought back

00:38:13.907 --> 00:38:15.490
this way of getting
really close to it

00:38:15.490 --> 00:38:18.000
and looking at it
with this video.

00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:21.040
But he also pulled his cap down
because he only wanted people

00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:22.660
to hear the music.

00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:24.640
And he also believes
he's very ugly

00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:28.380
and just didn't want to be seen.

00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:30.670
I was so used to reading it
through an American lens,

00:38:30.670 --> 00:38:33.100
I was sure this
was a bid for fame,

00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:34.950
like he was a kid that
made a video in hopes

00:38:34.950 --> 00:38:36.090
of getting a record deal.

00:38:36.090 --> 00:38:39.100
And while we were in New York,
a couple of record labels

00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.600
wanted to meet with
him, and he just

00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.558
didn't want to meet with
them, because for him,

00:38:42.558 --> 00:38:45.710
the whole thing is
feedback, like what

00:38:45.710 --> 00:38:47.510
do you think I did wrong?

00:38:47.510 --> 00:38:49.220
He would skim the
comments, and they

00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:51.150
were like, this guy's
better than Hendrix.

00:38:51.150 --> 00:38:52.550
This is the greatest
thing I've ever seen.

00:38:52.550 --> 00:38:53.470
I think it's a hoax.

00:38:53.470 --> 00:38:55.300
The sound's not synced.

00:38:55.300 --> 00:38:58.140
You know how the first ones
are usually like, holy shit,

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.016
and then later they're
like, this is a fake.

00:39:00.016 --> 00:39:02.140
It's always like that, like
you could just be like,

00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.830
[NON-SPEECH].

00:39:03.830 --> 00:39:09.470
So he ignored those and
then just paid attention to,

00:39:09.470 --> 00:39:11.150
he has a weird way
of moving his pinky,

00:39:11.150 --> 00:39:13.470
or the vibrato's
wrong or whatever,

00:39:13.470 --> 00:39:16.120
and just try to improve
his performance.

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.780
But then also, he wanted to
show people what he had done

00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:21.857
and see if they would do it
back, because he was also--

00:39:21.857 --> 00:39:23.940
I know it's going a little
far in this one thing--

00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.960
but since it was
such an early entry

00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.840
and it wasn't labeled
as a how to video,

00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:31.540
I feel like-- I
just used YouTube

00:39:31.540 --> 00:39:35.070
to find out how to fold this
tent, really hard pop up tent.

00:39:35.070 --> 00:39:37.970
And you know, none
of them are pros.

00:39:37.970 --> 00:39:38.770
It's not short.

00:39:38.770 --> 00:39:40.150
It's not clear when they do it.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:41.679
So I have to watch
a ton of them.

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:43.470
But so they're doing
something, as you say,

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:46.520
other than just showing
their expertise.

00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:48.390
And I think that's
what he was doing, too,

00:39:48.390 --> 00:39:50.462
being vulnerable
about his mistakes,

00:39:50.462 --> 00:39:52.420
but also wanting to show,
look at the direction

00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.920
I took this in for this
kind of back and forth.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.930
The last thing I'll
say is, in the US,

00:39:57.930 --> 00:39:59.147
this bothered him a lot.

00:39:59.147 --> 00:40:00.980
It was kind of like the
heyday of Green Day,

00:40:00.980 --> 00:40:03.271
or at least he thought that
everyone here was listening

00:40:03.271 --> 00:40:04.740
to Green Day, and in Europe.

00:40:04.740 --> 00:40:07.850
And he was like, we're
so good at guitar.

00:40:07.850 --> 00:40:09.640
Why do you all listen
so much to people

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.860
who are so bad at the guitar?

00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:15.760
And to find people that
wanted to be really, really

00:40:15.760 --> 00:40:17.610
good at this particular
kind of music,

00:40:17.610 --> 00:40:23.050
he needed to communicate with
midwestern Americans and people

00:40:23.050 --> 00:40:25.260
from northern England,
because they were apparently

00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.620
the only people interested
in playing this really

00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:30.380
complicated guitar music.

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:33.800
And they didn't have a
tablature language in common.

00:40:33.800 --> 00:40:36.090
So when they first saw
online video-- and that's

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:38.250
why they were such early
adaptors-- they were like,

00:40:38.250 --> 00:40:42.480
oh, finally, this is a way to
talk about music without taps.

00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.970
And so all that went into it.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:48.230
So when I saw these tent
people, some of them

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.460
are trying to create a brand
a little, bit you know?

00:40:50.460 --> 00:40:53.490
And they're like, one of
them is like Sexy Camper

00:40:53.490 --> 00:40:56.050
or Urban Camper or something,
where she's just like,

00:40:56.050 --> 00:40:57.860
I hate getting dirty,
but I go camping.

00:40:57.860 --> 00:41:00.780
And you have to wade
through her persona

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:04.950
to be like, how do I
get this tent down?

00:41:04.950 --> 00:41:06.530
And then there's
another person that,

00:41:06.530 --> 00:41:09.040
like Funtwo, doesn't like his
head in the picture, you know?

00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.350
But he's pretty good.

00:41:10.350 --> 00:41:13.080
But you know, some people
trying to do selfies,

00:41:13.080 --> 00:41:15.630
it's really hard to see it.

00:41:15.630 --> 00:41:18.090
But I piece them together.

00:41:18.090 --> 00:41:23.270
And also people have such mixed
motives for being on YouTube.

00:41:23.270 --> 00:41:25.410
I think some of
that is that tension

00:41:25.410 --> 00:41:26.570
that I love in that video.

00:41:26.570 --> 00:41:28.450
I mean, I'm assigning
you to watch

00:41:28.450 --> 00:41:30.130
the video because it's so good.

00:41:30.130 --> 00:41:32.502
But it's the level of
shyness from here up.

00:41:32.502 --> 00:41:33.960
It's like
[? charisma hiki. ?] It's

00:41:33.960 --> 00:41:36.640
like shyness, shut-in,
don't see me, I'm ugly,

00:41:36.640 --> 00:41:39.670
and then this incredible
virtuosity down here.

00:41:39.670 --> 00:41:42.310
You know, anyone before YouTube
or before online video who's

00:41:42.310 --> 00:41:44.830
going to pick up a guitar
and play for a room of people

00:41:44.830 --> 00:41:47.810
has to have chutzpah
and arrogance.

00:41:47.810 --> 00:41:51.150
And I think the first
discovery that he just

00:41:51.150 --> 00:41:53.020
could be really damn
good at this piece

00:41:53.020 --> 00:41:56.230
and play for people was
sort of a revelation.

00:41:56.230 --> 00:42:00.200
And I think Sexy Camper has
done that too, a little bit.

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:02.200
She's like, I wear makeup
while I go camping,

00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:03.750
and I want some points for that.

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:08.900
Yeah, I watch a lot of
haul videos, you know,

00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.310
videos of people who've
just been shopping,

00:42:11.310 --> 00:42:13.840
and then they just--you
guys know haul videos?

00:42:13.840 --> 00:42:14.340
Oh, yeah.

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.465
Then they just take out
clothes and they just like,

00:42:16.465 --> 00:42:19.240
I got this top, I
got these socks.

00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:20.480
They're going to be great.

00:42:20.480 --> 00:42:21.749
I got this.

00:42:21.749 --> 00:42:22.540
Just go on forever.

00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:24.860
But I mean the thing is,
why are we even speculating?

00:42:24.860 --> 00:42:26.570
There's Twitch.

00:42:26.570 --> 00:42:29.640
People just like to watch
weird things, you know?

00:42:29.640 --> 00:42:31.960
And I mean, I had hung
around the networks,

00:42:31.960 --> 00:42:33.820
and they were guessing,
what do people want?

00:42:33.820 --> 00:42:36.910
Like is the "Friends"
model stale?

00:42:36.910 --> 00:42:39.120
If we make two of
the friends obese,

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:40.440
will that be interesting?

00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:41.960
And then online,
they're like, how

00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.290
about guitar videos and haul.

00:42:43.290 --> 00:42:45.980
And racking up the views.

00:42:45.980 --> 00:42:48.540
So I don't know, I hope
that sort of addresses

00:42:48.540 --> 00:42:49.652
your question.

00:42:49.652 --> 00:42:51.110
BOB: By the way,
I'm going to sneak

00:42:51.110 --> 00:42:52.250
in one before this gentleman.

00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:54.000
A lot of people,
including some Googlers,

00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.130
are really embarrassed
about YouTube commenters.

00:42:56.130 --> 00:42:58.380
I think you have a different
point of view, don't you?

00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.320
VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN: I do.

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.830
I mean, YouTube
commenters are where

00:43:00.830 --> 00:43:02.996
the rubber hits the road
for the id of the internet.

00:43:02.996 --> 00:43:05.760
And you either love
them or you hate them.

00:43:05.760 --> 00:43:07.380
I love them.

00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:10.000
I mean, I just--
polyglot, I mean, just

00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.770
with enormous
allowances for the fact

00:43:11.770 --> 00:43:14.980
that so many people are in
their second and third language,

00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:18.620
and are not practiced
in reasoned dialogue

00:43:18.620 --> 00:43:20.860
and exchange of views.

00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:24.990
I do a little bit in here with
comments on a Beyonce video,

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:27.070
and they're incredibly powerful.

00:43:27.070 --> 00:43:29.210
I mean, if you like the
arc of a YouTube comment

00:43:29.210 --> 00:43:31.880
section, the holy shit,
this is fraud thing,

00:43:31.880 --> 00:43:34.380
or just, this is a
Betty Page video,

00:43:34.380 --> 00:43:35.460
you need to look at this.

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:38.180
People just, deep dives into it.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:39.090
I don't understand.

00:43:39.090 --> 00:43:40.920
Everyone hates YouTube
comment sections,

00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.620
and yet people write YouTube
comments all the time.

00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:48.380
So I'm not buying this, because
there are so many YouTube

00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:49.089
comments.

00:43:49.089 --> 00:43:51.630
Oh my gosh, if Google decides
to shut down comments like they

00:43:51.630 --> 00:43:52.220
keep doing.

00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:55.460
I mean, this is not a
nanny state world here.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.190
We can be subjected
to-- I mean, what,

00:43:58.190 --> 00:44:00.960
there's like white nationalism,
and there's people swearing.

00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:04.022
But there's a lot
more than that, too.

00:44:04.022 --> 00:44:05.980
There were muggers in
New York City in the '70s

00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:07.730
and it was still a
great time to be there.

00:44:11.460 --> 00:44:12.940
AUDIENCE: No problem.

00:44:12.940 --> 00:44:15.620
Thanks for coming
to give the talk.

00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:20.900
So I think for a lot
of us who, I would say,

00:44:20.900 --> 00:44:25.070
before Google was our first
experience of the internet.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:26.850
And you were talking
about Excalibur

00:44:26.850 --> 00:44:32.500
and having this kind of-- it
was kind of like a private club,

00:44:32.500 --> 00:44:34.780
almost, and you get
in, and you're like,

00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:39.390
oh, I'm the only person who has
internet access in my block.

00:44:39.390 --> 00:44:44.920
And you're like, the number
of people I'm talking to I

00:44:44.920 --> 00:44:47.270
can count on two hands,
that sort of thing.

00:44:47.270 --> 00:44:53.500
And now in 2016, people
coming on the internet

00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:59.560
for the first time,
it's much more public,

00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:04.470
and it's much more
about-- people

00:45:04.470 --> 00:45:09.020
use the phrase sharing
culture, that sort of thing.

00:45:09.020 --> 00:45:14.330
How much do you think that's
changed the, definitely

00:45:14.330 --> 00:45:17.010
like the performativeness
of being on the internet,

00:45:17.010 --> 00:45:20.680
but just our culture on
the internet in general?

00:45:20.680 --> 00:45:22.250
VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN: Yeah.

00:45:22.250 --> 00:45:27.780
I think that the culture
works in this very--

00:45:27.780 --> 00:45:31.990
to put this very schematically,
a dialectical way.

00:45:31.990 --> 00:45:35.350
So there's pushback on that.

00:45:35.350 --> 00:45:38.170
So Facebook has us register
name, rank, and serial number.

00:45:38.170 --> 00:45:40.020
I'm not Athena anymore.

00:45:40.020 --> 00:45:42.440
My face is connected
to my children.

00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:45.970
I'm beholden to and
responsible to a whole bunch

00:45:45.970 --> 00:45:49.730
of images and words
that keep me in bounds.

00:45:49.730 --> 00:45:52.560
I mean, Facebook
is for me, at 46,

00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.270
a wonderful retirement
community that

00:45:54.270 --> 00:45:59.110
is blessedly free of any
of you lively young people.

00:45:59.110 --> 00:46:01.710
And we get to talk
about, like, we're

00:46:01.710 --> 00:46:03.339
Democrats and
Republicans, and we

00:46:03.339 --> 00:46:04.588
have reasonable conversations.

00:46:07.310 --> 00:46:09.520
And then Twitter, where I
also spend a lot of time,

00:46:09.520 --> 00:46:11.740
is obviously a different idiom.

00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:13.120
There's more bots.

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:14.870
You can make up names.

00:46:14.870 --> 00:46:18.130
And that has more of the
rough and ready world

00:46:18.130 --> 00:46:21.400
that I remember, or that I
like in YouTube comments.

00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.520
But the carving out
of those small spaces

00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:26.340
so that you can have
that experience again

00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:31.750
is what I see as the pushback
against the Facebook monolith.

00:46:31.750 --> 00:46:36.140
So secret Facebook
groups have been amazing.

00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:39.640
I just saw one, this
gay one for Hillary

00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:42.200
that's called Hillary is
Madonna, where they just

00:46:42.200 --> 00:46:44.490
spend a lot of time talking
about how hot she is

00:46:44.490 --> 00:46:47.630
and how great all
her outfits are.

00:46:47.630 --> 00:46:51.790
And I'm on a bunch for
Hillary and a bunch

00:46:51.790 --> 00:46:55.510
for people in my demographics,
some of them my neighbors.

00:46:55.510 --> 00:46:59.580
And it's just like 15 of us, and
it might as well be Excalibur.

00:46:59.580 --> 00:47:01.700
I mean, we're just on
there all the time.

00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:02.440
It's in depth.

00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.070
We know each other.

00:47:04.070 --> 00:47:05.280
It's invite only.

00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:10.220
And I was just talking
to this aspiring rapper.

00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:11.940
And I was like, I
mean, you probably

00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.350
have something for music.

00:47:13.350 --> 00:47:16.150
And he was like, actually,
I have one for couponers.

00:47:16.150 --> 00:47:18.140
He belongs to this
board for couponers

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:21.160
which has 50,000
members, and they

00:47:21.160 --> 00:47:22.730
share information on couponing.

00:47:22.730 --> 00:47:25.170
And he gets so many
deals that I was like, I

00:47:25.170 --> 00:47:28.400
need to look into couponing.

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:34.850
But I get a lot of this
understanding of the internet,

00:47:34.850 --> 00:47:36.890
and in this book,
from urban theory,

00:47:36.890 --> 00:47:40.760
so the tension between a
Robert Moses highway builder

00:47:40.760 --> 00:47:44.760
builds big tower blocks,
and then Jane Jacobs,

00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:47.500
who admired the '50s way
that you cobbled together

00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:51.167
a little neighborhood with
tenements and little bodegas

00:47:51.167 --> 00:47:53.750
and places to sell things, and
ways that things kind of worked

00:47:53.750 --> 00:47:54.700
themselves out.

00:47:54.700 --> 00:47:58.020
And there are still
so many hybrid spaces

00:47:58.020 --> 00:48:00.440
like that on the internet.

00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.710
I met this woman in
Montana not long ago

00:48:02.710 --> 00:48:04.340
who said she doesn't
use the internet.

00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:06.215
She doesn't like social
networking, Facebook,

00:48:06.215 --> 00:48:07.580
it's too public.

00:48:07.580 --> 00:48:09.330
But she's had one
use for it, which

00:48:09.330 --> 00:48:13.730
is that she's been a member
of a total Web 1.0 message

00:48:13.730 --> 00:48:17.280
board for people who
suffer from fibromyalgia.

00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.660
And she's been using it
for 18 years or something,

00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:22.940
and she said, I'm finally
meeting my best friend.

00:48:22.940 --> 00:48:24.880
She's coming from New
York, my best friend,

00:48:24.880 --> 00:48:26.120
and I have never met her.

00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.384
I've been talking to her for
18 years about our sickness,

00:48:29.384 --> 00:48:30.550
and she's coming to meet me.

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:32.690
And I said I thought
it sounds like you

00:48:32.690 --> 00:48:34.670
use the internet in
a really good way.

00:48:34.670 --> 00:48:38.250
You know, that's
like a power player.

00:48:38.250 --> 00:48:42.300
And I've been surprised at how
many nooks and crannies are

00:48:42.300 --> 00:48:46.780
thriving in a kind of pushback.

00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:47.840
It's hard to codify it.

00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.280
It's hard to make money on it.

00:48:49.280 --> 00:48:51.402
You know, it's like
the haul videos.

00:48:51.402 --> 00:48:53.110
Those are the times
when like the culture

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:57.210
delights you, because you just
have no idea where it's going.

00:48:57.210 --> 00:49:00.250
Prison Talk is a huge board
for incarcerated people

00:49:00.250 --> 00:49:01.830
and the people who love them.

00:49:01.830 --> 00:49:06.080
You don't need to report on
the nationwide penal colony.

00:49:06.080 --> 00:49:07.350
Just hang out on that board.

00:49:07.350 --> 00:49:11.710
It's amazing how the texture
of prison life-- I mean,

00:49:11.710 --> 00:49:15.930
just the fragment of the board
devoted to poetry by prisoners

00:49:15.930 --> 00:49:18.590
in various prisons is
itself extraordinary,

00:49:18.590 --> 00:49:23.360
and something no one
would have predicted.

00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:25.210
It's an, I think,
15-year-old board

00:49:25.210 --> 00:49:28.860
started by a felon
who's out now,

00:49:28.860 --> 00:49:33.660
and he advocates for internet
access and prison reform.

00:49:33.660 --> 00:49:38.500
And it was amazing to
get that glimpse of that.

00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:41.220
So I just think that the
culture maintains itself

00:49:41.220 --> 00:49:43.620
in a really beautiful way.

00:49:43.620 --> 00:49:45.880
So once we have
one fear-- I just

00:49:45.880 --> 00:49:49.370
was hearing that it's
possible that people

00:49:49.370 --> 00:49:51.750
don't want connected homes.

00:49:51.750 --> 00:49:53.630
And I just gave a
talk on Bloomberg TV

00:49:53.630 --> 00:49:55.470
about connected cars.

00:49:55.470 --> 00:49:58.000
And Millennials
say that they know

00:49:58.000 --> 00:49:59.460
cars are all going
to be connected

00:49:59.460 --> 00:50:01.230
and they expect them
to be connected.

00:50:01.230 --> 00:50:05.500
But just because we expect
it as this horrible matrix

00:50:05.500 --> 00:50:08.360
inevitability doesn't
mean it will happen.

00:50:08.360 --> 00:50:09.940
The culture will
surprise us again,

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:11.773
and people will push
back on it, and they'll

00:50:11.773 --> 00:50:14.040
create maker
culture and foodism,

00:50:14.040 --> 00:50:17.980
undigitizable experiences
that have risen

00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:22.410
in tandem with the web,
people going to dark internet

00:50:22.410 --> 00:50:25.510
or taking tech sabbaths
or whatever, but even

00:50:25.510 --> 00:50:28.690
more strenuously, or
reviving vinyl or live music,

00:50:28.690 --> 00:50:30.970
or even seeing each other live.

00:50:30.970 --> 00:50:33.997
I mean, one of the first
promises at IBM was like,

00:50:33.997 --> 00:50:36.330
oh, this is so great, we never
have to go into an office

00:50:36.330 --> 00:50:36.830
again.

00:50:36.830 --> 00:50:38.960
We'll be teleconferencing
all the time.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.050
That's the last thing
anyone wants to do now.

00:50:41.050 --> 00:50:43.970
You want to look at
someone's crazy capillaries

00:50:43.970 --> 00:50:46.870
and-- did you hear
about this guy?

00:50:46.870 --> 00:50:49.780
He's not at Facebook.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:51.890
It sort of sounds
urban myth-y, but he

00:50:51.890 --> 00:50:53.840
had an addiction to Facebook.

00:50:53.840 --> 00:50:55.462
That's what he
thought, and he really

00:50:55.462 --> 00:50:56.670
wanted to jump off his phone.

00:50:56.670 --> 00:50:58.740
So he started doing
an LSD breakfast.

00:50:58.740 --> 00:50:59.890
Is this well-known?

00:50:59.890 --> 00:51:00.640
OK.

00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:01.450
Oh yeah, you know.

00:51:01.450 --> 00:51:05.470
So a tiny microdose of some
hallucinogen in the morning.

00:51:05.470 --> 00:51:08.690
And he discovered-- he
lost interest in his phone

00:51:08.690 --> 00:51:12.050
because the faces of people on
the bus became so compelling.

00:51:12.050 --> 00:51:15.490
And you know, faces are
really a lot more interesting

00:51:15.490 --> 00:51:16.850
than our screens.

00:51:16.850 --> 00:51:19.140
We look at that same
little few square inches,

00:51:19.140 --> 00:51:21.710
and then just look at a person.

00:51:21.710 --> 00:51:24.910
Steve Jobs said that
he wanted screens

00:51:24.910 --> 00:51:28.420
to be oleophobic, like no
oil could stick to them.

00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:31.820
And Johnny Ive hates humans.

00:51:31.820 --> 00:51:33.890
He just thinks we're
disgusting, basically,

00:51:33.890 --> 00:51:39.200
and doesn't want us to get
our sticky gross human selves

00:51:39.200 --> 00:51:41.100
on screens.

00:51:41.100 --> 00:51:43.880
But our sticky
gross human selves

00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:45.670
are really beautiful
and fascinating.

00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:47.129
You don't need the LSD.

00:51:47.129 --> 00:51:49.170
AUDIENCE: You were reading
this out of your book,

00:51:49.170 --> 00:51:50.850
and so now I can
actually quote it back.

00:51:50.850 --> 00:51:55.490
But you say digital forms
are best illuminated

00:51:55.490 --> 00:51:58.410
by cultural criticism, and
it shows the internet's

00:51:58.410 --> 00:52:00.610
glorious illusion that
the internet is life,

00:52:00.610 --> 00:52:03.560
because, of course, the
internet is not life.

00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:04.750
It's an artificial regime.

00:52:04.750 --> 00:52:06.900
And I'm wondering, do
you really mean that?

00:52:06.900 --> 00:52:09.400
I mean, it sounds like even
from the rest of your questions,

00:52:09.400 --> 00:52:11.070
you're like, art
is a part of life.

00:52:11.070 --> 00:52:13.590
And everything that's
happening online

00:52:13.590 --> 00:52:15.890
is real just as much as
everything that's happening

00:52:15.890 --> 00:52:18.969
face to face, just
different, right?

00:52:18.969 --> 00:52:21.260
And so I'm wondering if you
could say a little bit more

00:52:21.260 --> 00:52:24.820
about what your thoughts are on,
this is real or this is fake,

00:52:24.820 --> 00:52:27.419
it's made up, it's online,
it's not real life.

00:52:27.419 --> 00:52:29.460
VIRGINIA HEFFERNAN: This
may sound like a copout.

00:52:29.460 --> 00:52:30.560
I love that question.

00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.810
This may sound like a copout.

00:52:31.810 --> 00:52:33.640
Marshall McLuhan
said at one point

00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:37.210
that electronic circuitry
is orientalizing the west

00:52:37.210 --> 00:52:39.380
and collapsing
binary distinctions.

00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:42.550
And certainly the one
between, is this deception

00:52:42.550 --> 00:52:45.690
or is it true, would
be one of those

00:52:45.690 --> 00:52:49.360
that I feel like the internet
has pushed on really hard.

00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:53.270
So I say illusion, but the
kind of illusion that I mean

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:57.580
is the illusion of a game
where we have these proxies.

00:52:57.580 --> 00:53:00.390
Like when I was playing
Dungeons and Dragons,

00:53:00.390 --> 00:53:03.830
there used to be this fear,
this dread fear among adults

00:53:03.830 --> 00:53:06.130
that we might start
actually thinking

00:53:06.130 --> 00:53:10.530
we were high priestesses
and clerics, and snap,

00:53:10.530 --> 00:53:12.500
and go into the Dungeons
and Dragons world.

00:53:12.500 --> 00:53:14.770
And there was even a novel
about it, and you know,

00:53:14.770 --> 00:53:16.800
it was right around the corner.

00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:19.144
But I didn't think I was
a high priestess any more

00:53:19.144 --> 00:53:20.560
than when you're
playing Monopoly,

00:53:20.560 --> 00:53:23.490
you think you are a shoe.

00:53:23.490 --> 00:53:26.240
I really wanted to
win at Monopoly.

00:53:26.240 --> 00:53:29.800
I really put a lot of investment
in getting Broadway and getting

00:53:29.800 --> 00:53:33.180
Park Place getting building
houses on them, and you know,

00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:34.040
I'm the shoe.

00:53:34.040 --> 00:53:35.520
I've got this much money.

00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:38.070
But I knew that I didn't
have that much money,

00:53:38.070 --> 00:53:42.340
and it wasn't hard for me
to draw that distinction.

00:53:42.340 --> 00:53:44.700
The same way that when you
willingly suspend disbelief

00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.990
to read a novel, you both know
that the things are happening,

00:53:47.990 --> 00:53:49.150
and they're not happening.

00:53:49.150 --> 00:53:51.410
It's no fun if you
don't invest in them.

00:53:51.410 --> 00:53:55.360
It's no fun if you don't
care about the characters.

00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.090
But to over invest in the
illusion-- and by the way,

00:54:00.090 --> 00:54:02.540
there have always been fears
that people would turn Don

00:54:02.540 --> 00:54:06.290
Quixote and believe the
things in novels, too,

00:54:06.290 --> 00:54:09.010
and start to be like the readers
of Dickens-- who were like,

00:54:09.010 --> 00:54:12.690
little Joe died, we need to
petition to bring him back

00:54:12.690 --> 00:54:17.190
to life--were in misery, where
you believe the characters are

00:54:17.190 --> 00:54:18.560
real.

00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:20.110
But that's not all of us.

00:54:20.110 --> 00:54:24.110
Most of us can live
in that understanding

00:54:24.110 --> 00:54:25.180
that this is an illusion.

00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:26.160
It's not real life.

00:54:26.160 --> 00:54:28.050
And it's pleasurable
to commit ourselves

00:54:28.050 --> 00:54:31.620
to it-- sometimes
painful-- but sometimes I

00:54:31.620 --> 00:54:34.120
think my Twitter handle
takes sniper fire for me,

00:54:34.120 --> 00:54:36.820
keeps my soul safer.

00:54:36.820 --> 00:54:41.180
It's better, because all
those-- this picture of me?

00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:46.790
This one made on a computer,
with very few elements taken

00:54:46.790 --> 00:54:49.150
from my flesh and blood person?

00:54:49.150 --> 00:54:52.070
She does a lot of work
for me out in the world.

00:54:52.070 --> 00:54:54.700
Just like, you go deal
with these people.

00:54:54.700 --> 00:54:56.980
I'm going to sit home.

00:54:56.980 --> 00:54:58.420
Anyway, thank you so much.

00:54:58.420 --> 00:55:00.440
This was really fun.
