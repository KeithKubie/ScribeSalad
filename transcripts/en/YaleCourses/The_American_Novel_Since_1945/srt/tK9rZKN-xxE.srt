1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:05,910
Today, uh, is novel Pitch Day.
Uh, does everyone have a ballot?

2
00:00:06,150 --> 00:00:09,630
If you don't have a ballot there,
some down here

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,400
we have a wonderful list of six novels
all brought to you by students from this

4
00:00:16,561 --> 00:00:21,240
class.
I'll tell you,

5
00:00:21,241 --> 00:00:25,680
my dream is that one day someone
will pitch their own novel.

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,300
That's my dream. And I yell,
this could happen. Yes.

7
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:31,213
Thank you.

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:36,650
[inaudible] okay,

9
00:00:38,851 --> 00:00:41,720
we ready?
Yup.

10
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:47,090
Ballot [inaudible] without [inaudible]

11
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:54,540
further ado, if everybody
is ready, everybody ready?

12
00:00:57,030 --> 00:00:57,301
Now,

13
00:00:57,301 --> 00:01:02,301
each of these students has been
given five minutes only to make their

14
00:01:02,761 --> 00:01:06,480
presentation. And uh, at the end of it,

15
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:10,440
you will rank your top three choices.
One for your first choice,

16
00:01:10,441 --> 00:01:14,970
two for your second choice. Three,
the tfs will take your ballots,

17
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:16,050
they will leave the room.

18
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:20,520
I will begin to lecture on housekeeping.

19
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:22,980
And when they've added it all up,

20
00:01:22,981 --> 00:01:26,670
which should go pretty fast because
there are nine of them and they,

21
00:01:26,730 --> 00:01:28,860
they're very good at adding.
Um,

22
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:33,570
you have to know that to get
into the PHD programs here, uh,

23
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:35,880
there's a little arithmetic test.
Um,

24
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:41,130
they will add it all up and then I will
announce at the end of end of the class

25
00:01:41,160 --> 00:01:44,730
which book it will be. So,
uh, without further ado,

26
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,250
Emma bearish will come and talk.

27
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:53,390
Trust [inaudible] to use this training.

28
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,900
Yes, you can. Oh yes. Use this microphone
please. So that the camera can hear you.

29
00:02:00,380 --> 00:02:01,600
Okay.
Hi Camera.

30
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:04,120
Uh,
well thank you professor.

31
00:02:04,121 --> 00:02:08,860
Hunger for diamond a bearish and I'm
pitching Giovanni's room by James Baldwin.

32
00:02:09,340 --> 00:02:12,250
Uh, so what is Baldwin like? Well,

33
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,930
Baldwin is one of the Great 20th Century
American Authors and he has some really

34
00:02:16,931 --> 00:02:21,160
unique insights into human interaction
and a shrewd sensitivity and to the

35
00:02:21,161 --> 00:02:23,740
internal lives of his characters.
Um,

36
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:27,820
his background kind of shines through
his prose. He's the son of a preacher,

37
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:32,380
so his words have this like really
strong sort of grandness to them.

38
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,300
And there's a really, really a unique
resonance to everything he writes.

39
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:40,420
Anyway,
show Baldwin in my opinion,

40
00:02:40,780 --> 00:02:43,960
isn't read as often as she as often,
excuse me,

41
00:02:43,961 --> 00:02:46,870
as he should and academic settings.
So whew.

42
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:52,500
So I chose this book because I wanted to
use this opportunity to read Baldwin at

43
00:02:53,201 --> 00:02:57,010
Yale. And nifty little
fact about Giovanni's room.

44
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,230
It's about 150 pages and yeah.
Yeah. And it's eminently readable.

45
00:03:02,260 --> 00:03:05,830
So that's a, that's a big plus
at the end of the semester.

46
00:03:05,831 --> 00:03:09,580
But also I didn't just choose
Giovanni's room because it's short.

47
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,900
I chose it because it fits
seamlessly with our syllabus.

48
00:03:13,901 --> 00:03:16,360
So what's Giovanni's room about?
Well,

49
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,040
Giovanni's room is the story of David
a 20 something man who flees America to

50
00:03:21,041 --> 00:03:25,930
Paris in hopes of finding himself. Milan,
Paris, David Fine's, a fiance, hello.

51
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:31,000
And in her absence, another
lover, Giovanni on man.

52
00:03:31,660 --> 00:03:35,440
So the novel spirals around David's
reverie on one particular evening,

53
00:03:35,441 --> 00:03:40,000
the evening of Giovanni's execution.
I don't want to ruin anymore of the book,

54
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:44,050
so I'll let you wonder what
offense Giovanni has committed.

55
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:47,680
Now Giovanni's room fits with
the notion of the identity plot,

56
00:03:47,710 --> 00:03:50,380
which professor Hungerford was
discussing a lot last week.

57
00:03:50,710 --> 00:03:54,430
But here the identity problem
is founded in sexuality.

58
00:03:54,730 --> 00:03:58,700
A fascinating issue, which the literature
we've studied so far has yet to,

59
00:03:58,730 --> 00:04:03,370
to explore. Uh, so Giovanni's room
complicates the identity plot further,

60
00:04:03,820 --> 00:04:08,800
but you have on these were Giovanni's
room also explores national identity.

61
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:13,720
It is an American novel of x
patriotism, an American in Paris. Um,

62
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:15,310
so without further ado,

63
00:04:15,311 --> 00:04:20,311
I want to read a passage in which David
realizes his alienation from America and

64
00:04:20,771 --> 00:04:21,770
from Americanists.

65
00:04:21,771 --> 00:04:26,771
So here he is walking into the American
post office in Paris to pick up his

66
00:04:27,371 --> 00:04:28,204
mail,

67
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:32,530
yet walking into the American Express
office when harshly bright mid summer

68
00:04:32,540 --> 00:04:33,373
afternoon,

69
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:38,530
I was forced to admit that this active
so disquietingly cheerful hordes struck

70
00:04:38,531 --> 00:04:43,120
the eye at once as a unit at home,
I could have distinguished patterns,

71
00:04:43,121 --> 00:04:46,480
habits, accents of speech
with no effort, whatever.

72
00:04:46,510 --> 00:04:48,610
Now everybody sounded,

73
00:04:48,611 --> 00:04:53,320
unless I listened hard as though he
had just arrived from Nebraska at home,

74
00:04:53,321 --> 00:04:56,170
I could have seen the clothes they
were wearing. But here I only saw bags,

75
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:00,820
camera's belts, and hats all clearly
from the same department store at home.

76
00:05:00,820 --> 00:05:05,370
I would've had some sense
of the individual womanhood.
If the woman I faced here,

77
00:05:05,380 --> 00:05:07,030
the most ferociously accomplished,

78
00:05:07,031 --> 00:05:11,830
seem to be involved in some ice
cold or Sun dried travesty of sex.

79
00:05:11,831 --> 00:05:14,860
And even grandmothers seemed to
have had no traffic with the flesh.

80
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:18,970
And what distinguished the men was
that they seemed incapable of age.

81
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:20,350
They smelled of soap,

82
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:24,760
which seemed indeed to be
their preservative against
the dangers and exigencies

83
00:05:24,761 --> 00:05:27,760
of any more intimate odor.
The boy,

84
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:30,820
he had been shown somehow
unsoiled untouched,

85
00:05:30,821 --> 00:05:35,821
unchanged through the eyes of the man
of 60 booking passage with his smiling

86
00:05:35,921 --> 00:05:40,420
wife to Rome. His wife might've been
his mother forcing more ointment,

87
00:05:40,450 --> 00:05:43,960
oatmeal down his throat and ruin might've
been the movie she had promised to

88
00:05:43,961 --> 00:05:47,530
allow him to see. Yet I also
suspected that what I was seeing was,

89
00:05:47,531 --> 00:05:52,390
but a part of the truth and perhaps not
even the most important part beneath

90
00:05:52,391 --> 00:05:54,220
these faces,
these clothes accents,

91
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:59,221
rudeness is was power and sorrow
both admitted on realize the power of

92
00:06:00,141 --> 00:06:03,890
inventors, the sorrow of
the disconnected. Okay.

93
00:06:06,640 --> 00:06:11,060
All right. Here you see that
miserable sense of separation,

94
00:06:11,061 --> 00:06:14,930
that confusion, that
hopelessness, that Baldwin crafts,

95
00:06:15,140 --> 00:06:16,790
that loss of identity,

96
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:20,120
and perhaps you can begin to see the
beauty and the might of his language,

97
00:06:20,121 --> 00:06:23,390
which molds such a powerful story of love,

98
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:27,110
of loss and most importantly
of self. Okay, thank you.

99
00:06:27,540 --> 00:06:32,540
[inaudible] Kelsey,

100
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:36,493
where are you?

101
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:45,650
Are you ready for that? Just
a second. Hello, I'm Kelsey.

102
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:50,020
See and the book that I'm pitching is
one flew over the cuckoo's nest by Ken

103
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:50,710
Keasy.
Um,

104
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,000
it is about an a set in an insane asylum
and the narrator is a six foot seven

105
00:06:55,001 --> 00:06:57,790
schizophrenia deaf mute Indian
chief named chief Brondon,

106
00:06:58,210 --> 00:07:03,210
whose life is turned upside down by a
brutal and hedonistic man named Randall

107
00:07:03,250 --> 00:07:08,140
McMurphy. And, um, Ken Qc, who I need
to talk about a little bit, well,

108
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:11,650
it's sort of a rock star.
He was to the hippie generation.

109
00:07:11,651 --> 00:07:14,140
What Jack Kerouac was to the
beat generation. He was the,

110
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:18,010
as most pro outmost outspoken
proponent of LSD. Um,

111
00:07:18,011 --> 00:07:21,730
he and his merry pranksters went on
the road and their magic bus, um,

112
00:07:22,030 --> 00:07:23,760
touting it across the nation.
Um,

113
00:07:23,830 --> 00:07:27,720
one road trip that he took in 1964 with
Neal Cassady the same Neal Cassady who

114
00:07:27,721 --> 00:07:31,030
dean Moriarty was crafted
after, um, was, um,

115
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:34,450
written down in a book by Tom Wolf
called the electric koolaid acid trip.

116
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:37,950
So he has that sort of in common
with Jack Kerouac. And, um,

117
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,370
I'd like to play a little clip that I
have from a BBC interview with Casey about

118
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:43,810
Lsd effects on his writing.

119
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:48,943
Hmm.

120
00:07:50,500 --> 00:07:52,900
Oh, just some background in front
of just some background information.

121
00:07:52,901 --> 00:07:54,490
While he was writing one
flew over the cuckoo's nest.

122
00:07:54,491 --> 00:07:56,050
He was working in a mental institution.

123
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:01,810
He should were your answers at the
hospital inspiring to write a novel?

124
00:08:02,140 --> 00:08:03,730
One flew over the cuckoo's nest.

125
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:07,210
He claims the drugs and
it's just creativity.

126
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,710
I would've have not been able
to write that well without LSD.

127
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:20,330
[inaudible] because
right from rise to fame,

128
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:25,120
how did they ask every time
shortcut?

129
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:30,360
Should I lighten [inaudible] for those
of us who were like to go on the better

130
00:08:32,291 --> 00:08:36,560
realities and
prescribed,

131
00:08:37,480 --> 00:08:40,990
let's say, okay, the door's
been open this to the open. It

132
00:08:42,540 --> 00:08:43,373
okay

133
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:51,030
for that cheesy opens the door that Qsi
opens in one flew over the cuckoo's nest

134
00:08:51,041 --> 00:08:53,680
reveals the inner workings
of an insane asylum. Um,

135
00:08:53,740 --> 00:08:57,000
this of course draws attention to
the one most obvious and also most

136
00:08:57,001 --> 00:08:59,520
complicating theme of the
book. That of madness. Um,

137
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:03,050
we've touched on the theme of madness
before with Lolita and with, um,

138
00:09:03,090 --> 00:09:03,811
Franny and Zooey,

139
00:09:03,811 --> 00:09:06,900
but I don't think we've addressed it as
explicitly as we would with this book.

140
00:09:07,140 --> 00:09:10,050
I'm,
the book is set in an insane asylum.

141
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,650
There is no way to avoid
insanity. Um, at first glance,

142
00:09:13,651 --> 00:09:16,410
that might seem like a very
straight forward assertion. However,

143
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:19,770
the very sense of omnipresent madness and
the book is the one that I think ropes

144
00:09:19,771 --> 00:09:23,730
this book very neatly into the argument
of Professor Hungerford Syllabus. Um,

145
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:26,610
I think it's an intensification of
most of the things we studied so far.

146
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,350
For example,
the identity plot.

147
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:32,610
I think it's a very unique manifestation
of the identity plot because the people

148
00:09:32,611 --> 00:09:36,330
in the insane asylum are perhaps one of
the most isolated groups that you could

149
00:09:36,331 --> 00:09:39,540
possibly be, be a part of their
isolated by their own neuroses,

150
00:09:39,541 --> 00:09:40,750
the tyranny of the nurses and,

151
00:09:40,751 --> 00:09:44,160
and barricade of concrete
plexiglass and barbed wire. Um,

152
00:09:44,850 --> 00:09:48,570
I think if you imagine any attempt to
find yourself within the confines of a

153
00:09:48,571 --> 00:09:52,650
sanatorium, you can sort of
see how interesting a story
would be crafted on that.

154
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,550
Um,

155
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:56,880
another theme that we've talked about
is the relationship between language and

156
00:09:56,881 --> 00:09:57,481
experience.

157
00:09:57,481 --> 00:10:01,140
We talked about that with John Barth
and I think that's really important

158
00:10:01,141 --> 00:10:03,630
question to focus on when you're reading
a book like this because you have to

159
00:10:03,631 --> 00:10:04,800
think to yourself as you're reading,

160
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:08,430
how does an author accurately
capture the experience of insanity?

161
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:09,451
And more importantly,

162
00:10:09,451 --> 00:10:13,680
how can we as readers trust a narrator
that self diagnosed as insane? Um,

163
00:10:13,890 --> 00:10:17,550
and in that same vein, what is truth
and how does one portrayed truth?

164
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:19,770
I like to read a passage from the book.

165
00:10:19,771 --> 00:10:24,210
This is at the very beginning when we're
first introduced to the chief and he

166
00:10:24,211 --> 00:10:29,211
decides that he is going to begin telling
about all this about the hospital and

167
00:10:29,641 --> 00:10:32,010
her and the guys and about being Murphy.

168
00:10:32,580 --> 00:10:35,670
I've been silent so long now it's going
to roar out of me like flood waters.

169
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,430
And you think the guy telling this
is ranting and raving, my God,

170
00:10:38,431 --> 00:10:40,350
you think this is too horrible
to have really happened?

171
00:10:40,860 --> 00:10:43,080
This is too awful to be the truth,
but please,

172
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:46,950
it's still hard for me to have a clear
mind thinking on it. But it's the truth,

173
00:10:47,370 --> 00:10:48,570
even if it didn't happen.

174
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:52,890
So I think you can see to the confusion
that can arise from having an insane

175
00:10:52,891 --> 00:10:54,150
narrator.
Um,

176
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:58,170
one of the most enticing aspects
of this book is that it is funny,

177
00:10:58,290 --> 00:11:01,050
they're extremely hilarious
aspects of this book.

178
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,350
I don't know if any of you who've seen
the movie or at least that famous clip of

179
00:11:04,351 --> 00:11:06,510
Jack Nicholson laughing like a maniac.
Um,

180
00:11:06,780 --> 00:11:10,470
the movie in general doesn't do the book
justice at all whatsoever, of course.

181
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,550
But, um, I think that one moment is
quintessentially kit keasy and he used it.

182
00:11:14,551 --> 00:11:17,950
Humor, humor is his most powerful
tool in conveying his deepest,

183
00:11:17,970 --> 00:11:20,040
serious messages in this book.
Um,

184
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:24,210
one thing that I want to point out is
there's this really fascinating thing that

185
00:11:24,211 --> 00:11:27,000
happens over the course of this book,
and it's this,

186
00:11:27,210 --> 00:11:32,100
there's an x that frames the plot and
that x one arm is the chief's ascension

187
00:11:32,101 --> 00:11:36,510
from insanity. And the other
arm is remaking McMurphy's
descension into insanity.

188
00:11:36,511 --> 00:11:37,740
I think if we choose this book,

189
00:11:37,980 --> 00:11:40,620
one of the most challenging aspects of
our analysis of it will be defined where

190
00:11:40,621 --> 00:11:44,670
the two slopes of those
intersect. Um, just to wrap up,

191
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:47,640
I think that this book is absolutely
phenomenal and it's completely engrossing.

192
00:11:47,820 --> 00:11:50,250
My own introduction to
it was completely random.

193
00:11:50,490 --> 00:11:53,010
It was one of the books that my roommate
happened to throw into her suitcase

194
00:11:53,020 --> 00:11:55,510
before she came to Yale. And I read
it at the beginning of the year.

195
00:11:55,720 --> 00:11:58,960
I took it with me and my grandparents
over weekend and I didn't sleep the entire

196
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,690
weekend cause I was reading it. And,
um, I think if you choose this book,

197
00:12:01,691 --> 00:12:04,600
each and every one of you will be equally
as enthralled. So I hope you pick it.

198
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:10,110
[inaudible]

199
00:12:23,080 --> 00:12:23,913
hi,

200
00:12:25,570 --> 00:12:29,080
I'm pitching a Joan Didion's
play it as it lays. Um,

201
00:12:29,560 --> 00:12:31,180
Joan Didion is in my mind,

202
00:12:31,210 --> 00:12:35,110
one of the greatest intellectuals of
the second half of the 20th century.

203
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:37,240
She is perhaps best
known for her journalism,

204
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,690
particularly her collection of essays,
slouching towards Bethlehem,

205
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:45,490
which I believe came out in 1968 in
which she Cooley confronts and sensibly

206
00:12:45,491 --> 00:12:49,060
analyzes the confusing cultural
climate of the late 1960s.

207
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:53,740
What do you think is most
report remarkable about her
reporting is the lack of

208
00:12:53,741 --> 00:12:57,310
naivete with which this literally tiny
woman. I don't know if any of you seen,

209
00:12:57,770 --> 00:13:00,310
and I'm sure many of you seen,
I've seen a picture of her. She's,

210
00:13:00,790 --> 00:13:05,790
she's just remarkably small
[inaudible] so she is,

211
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:08,890
she's clear eyed but not unsympathetic,

212
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:12,460
innocent but detached and above all
candidate in her assessment of her country

213
00:13:12,461 --> 00:13:14,020
and her time.
Um,

214
00:13:14,080 --> 00:13:17,560
the voice that she develops in slouching
towards Bethlehem serves her very well

215
00:13:17,561 --> 00:13:19,840
and play it as it lays.
She's able here to,

216
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:23,080
to draw the same sort of precise
portraits that you relied upon in her

217
00:13:23,081 --> 00:13:27,850
nonfiction. There's lots of the novel
that is positively, undeniably seductive.

218
00:13:28,300 --> 00:13:31,620
The plot revolves around a sort
of marginal actress Mariah Yf,

219
00:13:31,621 --> 00:13:33,340
who's divorced from our director,
husband,

220
00:13:33,670 --> 00:13:37,270
and who drifts aimlessly through the
Hollywood party scene of the late 1960s

221
00:13:37,271 --> 00:13:40,870
waiting for something to touch her,
impact her emotionally and morally.

222
00:13:41,230 --> 00:13:44,920
She's both damaged and as a result,
utterly unreachable tragedies.

223
00:13:44,921 --> 00:13:49,450
And there are many major and minor
that sort of float blithely by slip,

224
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:52,390
slip off her or appear to.
It was a novel,

225
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:55,270
very much about a woman who
accepts everything, feels nothing,

226
00:13:55,300 --> 00:13:59,230
and finally resigned herself
to the inevitable. The
inevitable is in many cases,

227
00:13:59,231 --> 00:14:01,360
trivial fates dealt out
at cocktail parties.

228
00:14:01,900 --> 00:14:05,530
It is told in several voices Mariah's
and three of her closest friends.

229
00:14:05,590 --> 00:14:10,030
And each character is haunted by an
ineffable loss of meaning and consequences

230
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:15,190
that they either ignore or are ignorant
of willfully or otherwise. In many ways,

231
00:14:15,191 --> 00:14:17,410
these lives,
these characters lives are,

232
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:21,970
are coming or drifting apart and their
lack of awareness of this fact becomes

233
00:14:21,971 --> 00:14:24,070
through Didion's, uh, pros our own.

234
00:14:24,400 --> 00:14:28,780
So that's the shock of the final scenes
is both powerful and hopelessly hollow.

235
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,490
And I don't mean that in a negative sense.

236
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:35,880
I mean that we feel that consequences
perhaps or are unimportant,

237
00:14:37,451 --> 00:14:41,290
that there's, there's something larger
at work. Um, so play it as it lays,

238
00:14:41,291 --> 00:14:44,470
I think fits very nicely into the
syllabus because it provides a beautiful

239
00:14:44,471 --> 00:14:48,910
contrast to the crying of lot 49 and
that it depicts the disintegration of

240
00:14:48,911 --> 00:14:52,910
southern California and specifically
La and a much less manic but no trial,

241
00:14:52,940 --> 00:14:57,940
no less troubling way Didion's language
and it's flat plain tone minimums mimics

242
00:14:58,611 --> 00:15:02,840
the flat plain Los Angeles of her
narrative as pensions convoluted,

243
00:15:02,870 --> 00:15:07,400
elusive language does his perplexing and
intricate portrait of the city. Also,

244
00:15:07,401 --> 00:15:11,810
as with housekeeping, the loss of self
is imagined as a dispersal though.

245
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:13,490
When did he in this dispersal is a cold,

246
00:15:13,520 --> 00:15:18,520
defensive and ultimately
empty one slouching towards
Bethlehem because the quote

247
00:15:18,771 --> 00:15:21,230
from Yates that includes the phrase,
the center will not hold.

248
00:15:21,231 --> 00:15:23,990
This is become very emblematic
of that era. Mariah,

249
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:28,160
who in the first few pages declares that
nothing applies to her is perhaps one

250
00:15:28,161 --> 00:15:32,030
of the most poignant examples of the
personal consequences of the loosening,

251
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:36,410
the loss of cultural restrictions
in the 1960s a time when in fact,

252
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:39,710
none of the old rules applied
to her or anyone else did.

253
00:15:39,711 --> 00:15:44,120
Ian Proposes that the consequences of
this freedom might be more than any single

254
00:15:44,121 --> 00:15:49,100
individual can cope with. Um,
that in fact, if nothing applies,

255
00:15:49,130 --> 00:15:52,720
the individual center, no
lessons. Societies cannot hold it.

256
00:15:52,721 --> 00:15:55,370
His account of the 60s that
appears perhaps elsewhere,

257
00:15:55,371 --> 00:15:59,900
but was I think divine defined
by Didion. Um, in this novel. Uh,

258
00:16:00,010 --> 00:16:03,560
and I want to read a very brief
paths from the beginning. Um,

259
00:16:05,840 --> 00:16:07,580
uh,
here we go.

260
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:11,600
I am what I am to look for
reasons is beside the point,

261
00:16:11,930 --> 00:16:15,230
but because the pursuit of reasons
is their business. Here she is,

262
00:16:15,290 --> 00:16:19,430
I believe at this point institutionalized.
Uh, they asked me questions. Mariah,

263
00:16:19,490 --> 00:16:23,750
yes or no. I see a cock in this
ink blot. Mariah, yes or no.

264
00:16:23,810 --> 00:16:26,840
A large number of people are
guilty of bad sexual conduct.

265
00:16:27,140 --> 00:16:30,590
I believe my sins are on pardonable.
I have been disappointed in love.

266
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:35,030
How could I answer? How could
it apply? Nothing applies.

267
00:16:35,090 --> 00:16:39,260
I print with the magnet, magnetized
Ibm Pencil, what does apply?

268
00:16:39,261 --> 00:16:42,350
They ask later as if the
word nothing were ambiguous,

269
00:16:42,410 --> 00:16:45,690
open to interpretation of
questionable fragment of an,

270
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:47,660
of an Icelandic room.

271
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:52,160
There are only certain facts I say try
and again to be an agreeable player of

272
00:16:52,161 --> 00:16:56,960
the game. Certain facts,
certain things that happened,
they will misread the facts,

273
00:16:57,020 --> 00:17:00,380
invent connections, we'll
extrapolate reasons where none exist.

274
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:04,520
But I told you that is their business
here and I think it would be,

275
00:17:05,270 --> 00:17:08,660
I think it would be wonderful to end
the semester with a strong female voice

276
00:17:08,900 --> 00:17:12,050
that historically amusing,
courageous and especially cold.

277
00:17:12,051 --> 00:17:14,270
And I don't mean cold in
the in the negative sense,

278
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:19,600
just that she approaches things in a
sort of detached way that allows you to

279
00:17:20,481 --> 00:17:25,040
observe these characters but not attach
yourselves to them in a way that,

280
00:17:25,490 --> 00:17:29,030
uh, the promotes is sort
of self identification, uh,

281
00:17:29,270 --> 00:17:32,600
that makes it difficult for
you to judge their actions. Um,

282
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:36,560
perhaps most important. It's also
fairly short, just over 200 pages fast,

283
00:17:36,561 --> 00:17:39,920
captivating read. Um, this
is sort of stupid analogy,

284
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:44,270
but I imagine it's sort of like getting
on a highway in La, not during rush hour,

285
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:49,130
but sort of a heading. Which way are
you going? Maybe east towards the hills.

286
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:50,430
Um,
and

287
00:17:50,460 --> 00:17:54,630
you get to your exit sort of before
you realize it. Um, so that's my pitch.

288
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,583
Thank you.

289
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,600
[inaudible]

290
00:18:06,840 --> 00:18:08,060
hi,
my name is will,

291
00:18:10,010 --> 00:18:14,760
I'm pitching Jesus's son by Denis
Johnson. Um, I'm actually gonna start,

292
00:18:14,761 --> 00:18:16,650
but without introducing it at all.

293
00:18:16,651 --> 00:18:20,070
I'm just going to play a clip from the
movie that was made of the book and then

294
00:18:20,071 --> 00:18:20,930
I'm going to talk about

295
00:18:23,330 --> 00:18:27,230
that was a clip from the movie version
of Jesus son. Um, and this is the book,

296
00:18:27,710 --> 00:18:31,550
it's by Dennis Johnson, who has been in
the news a lot lately because he wrote,

297
00:18:31,580 --> 00:18:35,780
um, tree of smoke, which won the
national book award in 2007. Um,

298
00:18:36,410 --> 00:18:40,940
and this, this book is kind of the book
that established him as like a serious,

299
00:18:40,970 --> 00:18:44,570
great author. Um, and I,
I think it's wonderful.

300
00:18:44,571 --> 00:18:47,140
It's a collection of stories.
Um,

301
00:18:47,240 --> 00:18:50,150
and they're all kind of
about the same character. Um,

302
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,340
one of the characters
you saw in there and uh,

303
00:18:52,370 --> 00:18:55,700
the kind of the same group of characters
runs through all the different stories.

304
00:18:55,930 --> 00:18:57,920
Um, and so it's kind of
novelistic in that way.

305
00:18:57,921 --> 00:19:02,900
Kind of like I'm lost in the
fun house, the book we read. Um,

306
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,500
I guess, uh, the,

307
00:19:06,680 --> 00:19:09,500
as you might or might not have been able
to tell from the clip the book kind of

308
00:19:09,501 --> 00:19:14,380
deals with a drug addiction and the main
character is addicted to heroin. Um,

309
00:19:14,990 --> 00:19:19,430
but I really think the book kind
of transcends that drug genre. Um,

310
00:19:19,460 --> 00:19:23,870
I really, uh, don't, I'm not a
huge fan of drug books myself,

311
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:28,310
but I think this,
but I think this book is really,

312
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:33,080
really beautiful and powerful and
devastating and really hilarious,

313
00:19:33,081 --> 00:19:37,570
really funny at times. Um, I
guess what else? It's short, uh,

314
00:19:37,670 --> 00:19:40,480
like everyone else has been saying,
but this book really is short. Uh,

315
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,720
[inaudible]

316
00:19:43,910 --> 00:19:47,290
it's a, it's only 160 pages and there
really aren't very many words then.

317
00:19:48,960 --> 00:19:53,740
Um, cause it's quite, it's
quite small as you can see. Um,

318
00:19:55,990 --> 00:20:00,460
uh, and, and I really, I find this book,

319
00:20:00,910 --> 00:20:05,170
um, I mean, I don't know how much I
want to describe it, but it's the main,

320
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:10,000
it takes place mostly in Iowa and kind
of just travels around kind of like daily

321
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,030
things. That one, one of
the stories, they, uh,

322
00:20:13,031 --> 00:20:17,080
the main character and his friend decided
to rip scrap metal from a house and

323
00:20:17,081 --> 00:20:20,790
sell it, uh, to make a little money
so they can get drunk that night. Um,

324
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:24,910
and just different kinds of adventures
that they get. One and it's really, um,

325
00:20:24,911 --> 00:20:27,370
and then, uh, the book
kind of ends in a mercy,

326
00:20:27,371 --> 00:20:31,540
makes us kind of pilgrimage to
Arizona. Um, it's really beautiful.

327
00:20:31,570 --> 00:20:33,850
I guess I'll just read
you a quick passage.

328
00:20:34,590 --> 00:20:37,920
That's all right.
Um,

329
00:20:38,930 --> 00:20:42,590
we bumped softly down a hill toward an
open field that seemed to be a military

330
00:20:42,591 --> 00:20:47,000
graveyard filled with rows and rows of
austere identical markers over soldiers.

331
00:20:48,190 --> 00:20:52,330
I'd never before come across the cemetery
on the farther side of the field,

332
00:20:52,331 --> 00:20:53,800
just beyond the curtains of snow.

333
00:20:53,801 --> 00:20:57,580
The Sky was torn away and the angels
were descending out of a brilliant blue

334
00:20:57,581 --> 00:21:01,270
summer. They're huge faces streaked
with light and full of pity.

335
00:21:01,690 --> 00:21:05,770
The sight of them cut through my heart
and down the knuckles of my spine and if

336
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:09,130
there been anything in my bowels,
I would have messed my pants from fear.

337
00:21:09,850 --> 00:21:13,960
Georgie opened his arms and cried out.
It's the drive and man the drive in.

338
00:21:14,020 --> 00:21:15,640
I wasn't sure what these words meant.

339
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:20,530
They're showing movies in a fucking
blizzard. George screamed. I see.

340
00:21:20,620 --> 00:21:22,420
I thought it was something else.
I said.

341
00:21:23,110 --> 00:21:28,030
We walked carefully down there and climbed
through the busted fence and stood in

342
00:21:28,031 --> 00:21:32,050
the very back. The speakers, which
I had mistaken for grave markers,

343
00:21:32,051 --> 00:21:36,130
muttered in unison. Then there was tinkly
music of which I could barely knew,

344
00:21:36,220 --> 00:21:37,960
very nearly make out the tune.

345
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:42,760
Famous movie stars Rode Bicycles beside
a river laughing out of their gigantic,

346
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:46,150
lovely mouth's.
If anybody had ever come to see this show,

347
00:21:46,151 --> 00:21:47,890
they'd have left when the weather started.

348
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:52,450
Not One car remains not even a broken
down one from last week or one left here

349
00:21:52,451 --> 00:21:56,770
because it was out of gas and a couple
of minutes in the middle of a whirling

350
00:21:56,771 --> 00:22:00,190
square dance. The screen turn
black, the cinematic summer ended,

351
00:22:00,191 --> 00:22:04,540
the snow went dark. There was
nothing but my breath. Um,

352
00:22:05,380 --> 00:22:08,920
so I guess that gives you enough of
an idea of it. Um, I think it's great.

353
00:22:08,921 --> 00:22:11,250
I think you should vote for it.
It's quick reads,

354
00:22:11,260 --> 00:22:14,720
really riveting and enthralling and uh,

355
00:22:14,950 --> 00:22:18,130
I find it really incredible book.
So Jesus son

356
00:22:18,630 --> 00:22:23,630
[inaudible].

357
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,150
Hi, I'm Eli. Um, uh,

358
00:22:34,151 --> 00:22:37,990
the book I wanted to pitch was everything
is illuminated by Jonathan Safran for

359
00:22:38,350 --> 00:22:39,310
um,
and uh,

360
00:22:39,311 --> 00:22:42,130
the main reason I want to pitch it of
course was professor Hungerford said that

361
00:22:42,610 --> 00:22:45,740
she's waiting for one of us to
pitch a their own book. And, um,

362
00:22:45,850 --> 00:22:47,500
contrary to conventional wisdom.

363
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:51,290
This is actually my own book you see now,

364
00:22:51,310 --> 00:22:53,140
but setting side authorship issues.

365
00:22:53,940 --> 00:22:56,470
The other thing is you just had to
introduce the seed of doubt and then the

366
00:22:56,471 --> 00:23:00,100
rumors percolate. So this is, um, I, uh,

367
00:23:00,130 --> 00:23:03,520
I love books that had outrageous
characters actually hearing some of these

368
00:23:03,521 --> 00:23:05,650
pitches. I was like, Oh, maybe I
should vote for some other boats,

369
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:08,020
but I want to tell you
that. But, um, this book,

370
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:12,400
but this book does have
outrageous characters, which
is really cool. Um, and, uh,

371
00:23:12,460 --> 00:23:14,170
also I just thought the pitch,

372
00:23:14,171 --> 00:23:16,930
I would just kind of describe some
of the characters and you'd be like,

373
00:23:16,931 --> 00:23:19,870
those characters are indeed outrageous.
There you go. I will vote for this book.

374
00:23:20,680 --> 00:23:22,780
So the book kind of takes
place in two different worlds.

375
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:25,270
One is the world of track and broad,
um,

376
00:23:25,300 --> 00:23:28,700
which is a small shtetl
in the 18th century. Um,

377
00:23:28,760 --> 00:23:32,980
and also Jonathan Safran for his ancestral
home and the other world is kind of

378
00:23:33,010 --> 00:23:35,460
modern day Ukraine. Um, and it, it,

379
00:23:35,461 --> 00:23:38,470
it features Jonathan Safran
Foer on a quest as I'm,

380
00:23:38,471 --> 00:23:39,640
I don't know if you Jews out there,

381
00:23:39,641 --> 00:23:42,110
I'm sure at some point I had
done this as I have, you know,

382
00:23:42,130 --> 00:23:45,440
been drawn to like Slovakia,
Ukraine to find the ancestral home.

383
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:50,050
And that's what Jonathan said before
is doing this book. So I'm in the, uh,

384
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:53,480
kind of modern day world. Um, there
are a number of really cool characters.

385
00:23:53,481 --> 00:23:54,530
The main one is the hero,

386
00:23:54,531 --> 00:23:58,820
Jonathan Safran for who is also referred
to as the quote spoiled you and the

387
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:01,790
quote. And Genius to, um, the, uh,

388
00:24:01,791 --> 00:24:05,090
other characters is humble
translator Alexander Shove,

389
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:10,130
who learned English exclusively through
the use of a thesaurus. Um, and who, uh,

390
00:24:10,730 --> 00:24:14,000
which produces some outrageous results
and who works for the family business

391
00:24:14,001 --> 00:24:17,660
heritage touring, which is he,
his description of it is a quote.

392
00:24:17,810 --> 00:24:21,390
It's for Jewish people like the hero who
have cravings to leave the unknowable

393
00:24:21,420 --> 00:24:24,650
country America and visit humble
towns in Poland and Ukraine.

394
00:24:24,950 --> 00:24:27,440
I will be truthful again and
mentioned that before this voyage,

395
00:24:27,590 --> 00:24:30,710
I have the opinion that Jewish people
were having shit between their brains.

396
00:24:31,040 --> 00:24:34,820
That is because all I knew of Jewish
people was that they paid father very much

397
00:24:34,821 --> 00:24:39,630
currency in order to make vacations
from America to Ukraine if we forgot.

398
00:24:40,070 --> 00:24:44,720
And then there's also a Alex's
dog, Sammy Davis, Jr Jr,

399
00:24:44,870 --> 00:24:49,010
which is, um, heritage Turing's
coat officious seeing I bitch.

400
00:24:50,170 --> 00:24:53,420
Um, so, and that's one road. And then in
the other world, the world of the Shtetl,

401
00:24:53,421 --> 00:24:57,680
we have a well regarded rabbi who
speaks exclusively in capitals.

402
00:24:58,010 --> 00:24:59,900
We have a broad,
a brilliant girl,

403
00:24:59,901 --> 00:25:04,901
and a magic emerges magically from a
river has adopted by the disgrace user.

404
00:25:05,270 --> 00:25:08,090
Yankel Yankel d we have two synagogues,

405
00:25:08,091 --> 00:25:11,240
the congregation of the slouchers
and the congregation of the upright.

406
00:25:11,720 --> 00:25:16,490
We have villagers including the deceased
philosopher pin class t who in his only

407
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:20,720
notable paper to the dust from man you
came. And two man, you shall return,

408
00:25:20,960 --> 00:25:24,890
argues that it would be possible in
theory for life in art to be reversed.

409
00:25:25,190 --> 00:25:28,640
We have the good gefilte fish
monger bits, little bits. We'll are,

410
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:33,200
we have the mad squire and village
rapists. Sophia out. Can we have Harry v,

411
00:25:33,201 --> 00:25:36,950
the [inaudible] master logician and
resident pervert who had been working for

412
00:25:36,951 --> 00:25:39,680
many years on his magnum opus,
the host of hoists,

413
00:25:39,800 --> 00:25:44,060
which he promised contain the tightest
of tight logical proofs that God

414
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:47,450
indiscriminately loves the
indiscriminant lover. Um,

415
00:25:48,140 --> 00:25:52,340
I don't know how many of us that
will pardon here, but anyhow,

416
00:25:52,440 --> 00:25:54,050
so besides these outrageous characters,

417
00:25:54,060 --> 00:25:57,190
I do think that the book fits well
with the themes of the course. Um,

418
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:00,650
it deals with identity, um,
language and experience,

419
00:26:00,770 --> 00:26:05,330
problems of narration and remembrance.
Um, as a, the New York Times Book Review,

420
00:26:06,350 --> 00:26:10,100
I guess you can say lauded the book I'm
quoting, not since a clockwork orange,

421
00:26:10,101 --> 00:26:14,180
has the English language
been simultaneously mauled
and energized with such

422
00:26:14,181 --> 00:26:17,690
brilliance and such Breo.
Um, so going with that,

423
00:26:17,691 --> 00:26:21,110
I thought I'd read as people have been
inclined to do a passage from the book,

424
00:26:21,290 --> 00:26:22,840
I'm going to take a little risk here.
Um,

425
00:26:23,240 --> 00:26:26,410
I've been reading the book with
a Russian accent in my head. Um,

426
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:29,630
so I figured I would just,
you know, I would be okay.

427
00:26:30,650 --> 00:26:32,870
I figured that would have
the added benefit of like,

428
00:26:32,871 --> 00:26:36,200
you're not gonna like be like, you
know, if you don't vote for this book,

429
00:26:36,201 --> 00:26:39,320
then I'll just be the kid who made a
fool of himself and red with a Russian

430
00:26:39,321 --> 00:26:43,260
accent in front of everybody.
So I know you don't want to do that to me

431
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:49,800
unless, yeah. Okay. So here we go.

432
00:26:50,460 --> 00:26:53,400
This is Alex kind of introducing
himself at the beginning of the book.

433
00:26:54,360 --> 00:26:57,450
I did Negroes,
particularly Michael Jackson,

434
00:26:58,110 --> 00:27:02,160
I did to disseminate very much, couldn't
see at famous nightclubs in Odessa.

435
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:04,540
Lamborghini Countach is excellent.

436
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:08,970
And so our cappuccinos and many girls
want to be carnal with me and many good

437
00:27:08,971 --> 00:27:12,570
arrangements,
not withstanding the inebriated kangaroo,

438
00:27:12,750 --> 00:27:15,540
the Gorky tickle and the
unyielding zookeeper.

439
00:27:16,350 --> 00:27:19,050
If you want to know why so
many girls want to be with me,

440
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:21,090
it is because I am very premium person.

441
00:27:21,091 --> 00:27:25,410
There'll be with I am humbly and also
severely funny and these are winning

442
00:27:25,411 --> 00:27:27,540
things.
But nonetheless,

443
00:27:27,541 --> 00:27:31,710
I know many people with Diego rapid cars
and famous disco techs that are so many,

444
00:27:31,711 --> 00:27:36,080
her pro who performed the Sputnik bosom
deleons which is always terminated with

445
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:40,320
slimy on their face that they cannot tell
you them on all my hands that are even

446
00:27:40,321 --> 00:27:45,300
many people named Alex 30 in my house
alone. That is why I was so effervescent.

447
00:27:45,301 --> 00:27:50,301
The goto lots and translate for Jonathan
Safran Foer it would be an ordinary.

448
00:27:50,730 --> 00:27:52,730
So that is said in a full,

449
00:27:52,970 --> 00:27:57,970
proudly made [inaudible]

450
00:28:03,450 --> 00:28:06,670
well, uh, it's really unfortunate
to have to go after that.

451
00:28:08,120 --> 00:28:12,540
But uh, hi, my name is Roger. I'm
presenting for Amenas section. Um,

452
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:14,860
and we're uh, doing Dave
Edgars. What is the,

453
00:28:14,861 --> 00:28:19,520
what you can't see the one because
it's 20% off plug. Plug. Um, and, uh,

454
00:28:19,570 --> 00:28:24,130
I guess rather than a trip to sound the
book myself, I'll use a, not the authors,

455
00:28:24,131 --> 00:28:28,540
but the person about whom the book is
written, his own words. Uh, what is the,

456
00:28:28,541 --> 00:28:31,900
what is the soulful account of my life
from the time I was separated from my

457
00:28:31,901 --> 00:28:35,890
family in Mario by if I
mispronounced that I'm so sorry. Um,

458
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:39,250
to the 13 years I spent an
Ethiopian and Kenyan refugee camps.

459
00:28:39,340 --> 00:28:42,730
Do you mind counter with vibrant western
cultures beginning in Atlanta to the

460
00:28:42,731 --> 00:28:46,570
generosity and challenges that
I encountered elsewhere? Um,

461
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:49,090
so just add a little bit to that.
What is the,

462
00:28:49,091 --> 00:28:53,990
what is it is a story of a Sudanese
refugee in the United States. Um,

463
00:28:54,070 --> 00:28:55,720
and in the course of telling it,

464
00:28:55,721 --> 00:29:00,070
he weeps and accounts from his life
back in Africa to stories. I'm here,

465
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:03,130
the United States and
everything in between. Um,

466
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:07,060
as for reasons why you should want
to vote for it or read it. Um,

467
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,180
I think the first thing, which
many of us in the section, um,

468
00:29:10,240 --> 00:29:12,760
realize how the book is just
that it's really engaging.

469
00:29:12,940 --> 00:29:14,770
It's written in a way
that's, um, I get like,

470
00:29:14,771 --> 00:29:17,710
I would say kind of refreshing
compared to some of the other more, uh,

471
00:29:17,920 --> 00:29:21,590
how to put it on complex, uh,
authors that we've read, um,

472
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:24,400
in that it's just really accessible and,
you know,

473
00:29:24,401 --> 00:29:27,790
really just an easy read that that's,
that's, that's deeply human. I mean,

474
00:29:27,791 --> 00:29:30,280
you feel like you're having a
conversation with the guy. Um,

475
00:29:30,310 --> 00:29:33,470
and even though the guys actually
having a conversation with David Edgars,

476
00:29:33,471 --> 00:29:37,180
so maybe that's why you get that
impression. But, um, at any rate, uh,

477
00:29:37,240 --> 00:29:42,220
it's also a book which manages to,
um, address really, really serious,

478
00:29:42,250 --> 00:29:47,020
um, can kind of, you know, current
issues such as civil war, uh, Chan aside,

479
00:29:47,160 --> 00:29:49,000
um,
alienation in American society,

480
00:29:49,210 --> 00:29:52,810
but do so in a way that simultaneously
really poignant and inspiring,

481
00:29:52,811 --> 00:29:54,070
but also actually funny.

482
00:29:54,071 --> 00:29:57,280
Like it's not a book that you're
going to read and be depressed by,

483
00:29:57,430 --> 00:30:00,400
even though you will come from it.
Having really felt that you're, you're,

484
00:30:00,401 --> 00:30:02,960
you're dealing with really
significant material, which, um,

485
00:30:03,130 --> 00:30:06,010
I thought is really cool and
we thought was really cool. Um,

486
00:30:06,280 --> 00:30:08,980
it's also just going on the
whole like contemporary thing.

487
00:30:09,100 --> 00:30:13,330
It's written by one of the
best contemporary authors
out there. Uh, he's, uh,

488
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:16,630
he was nominated for a Pulitzer prize,
or here's a Pulitzer prize finalist,

489
00:30:16,631 --> 00:30:20,470
I think last year in 2007. I'm not sure,
um, if I got that wrong and some of,

490
00:30:20,471 --> 00:30:24,730
here's the big Eggers fan. I'm terribly
sorry. Um, but, uh, yeah, he's great.

491
00:30:24,731 --> 00:30:29,440
And intercourse where we went, you know,
doing from 1945 to the present. Um,

492
00:30:29,470 --> 00:30:34,180
I think it's good to have to have a
really strong, really contemporary author,

493
00:30:34,330 --> 00:30:39,130
um, represented. So that's another cool
thing. Um, another thing which I think is,

494
00:30:39,180 --> 00:30:41,760
which would be really cool I'm reading
this book, is that it's not an act,

495
00:30:41,830 --> 00:30:43,720
it's not your standard
academic book at all. I mean,

496
00:30:43,721 --> 00:30:47,320
you're not gonna find this book
on any syllabus, but I mean,

497
00:30:47,321 --> 00:30:50,610
it's still really merits,
um, like being read in,

498
00:30:50,611 --> 00:30:52,960
in that sort of context because of the,
you know,

499
00:30:52,961 --> 00:30:55,420
the depth of the material is being
covered because of the way it's written.

500
00:30:55,421 --> 00:30:56,920
It's really,
there's some beautiful descriptions.

501
00:30:56,921 --> 00:31:00,130
There's beautiful language and Wealthfront
and for any other reason that you'd

502
00:31:00,131 --> 00:31:02,860
want to read a book in the class, it can
serve that function. And yet, you know,

503
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:06,220
you'd probably be more like to hear about
it in a coffee shop or in a restaurant.

504
00:31:06,490 --> 00:31:09,730
Um, so I mean, I think that's a,
that's a pretty cool opportunity,

505
00:31:09,880 --> 00:31:13,270
which this would give us, um, as far
as like tying into the course matters.

506
00:31:13,390 --> 00:31:17,590
This book is a great, great study
and I think, I would think, um, uh,

507
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:21,400
an unprecedented study as far as that
identity plot goes for our class because,

508
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:23,670
um, as a black African, I'm,

509
00:31:23,710 --> 00:31:28,540
the protagonist is identified not by his
ethnicity in the United States, but by,

510
00:31:28,600 --> 00:31:33,180
but by his race. Um, and as it's
shown in a, in a really very, uh,

511
00:31:33,450 --> 00:31:36,260
you know, interesting, I guess
a scene in the, in the Vat,

512
00:31:36,270 --> 00:31:39,880
the very meaning of the book where he's
being robbed by, by black man who, uh,

513
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:43,420
who says to him, Oh, well we're brothers
because your f on because you're African.

514
00:31:43,420 --> 00:31:47,010
And at the same time to ride's only refers
to as African and actually mislabeled.

515
00:31:47,040 --> 00:31:49,120
And as Nigerian when he's Sudanese.
Um,

516
00:31:49,121 --> 00:31:53,350
so it really offers some
really interesting perspective
into issues of, of race,

517
00:31:53,351 --> 00:31:56,670
issues of ethnicity, um, and just, uh,

518
00:31:56,710 --> 00:32:01,360
just a totally new look at American
society, um, from, uh, yeah, uh,

519
00:32:01,361 --> 00:32:04,660
perspective that we're not really
used to. Um, I guess, yeah,

520
00:32:04,690 --> 00:32:06,550
that basically covers
that as far as some other,

521
00:32:06,551 --> 00:32:08,020
maybe a little bit sillier things.

522
00:32:08,080 --> 00:32:11,620
This is a great date book for those of
you who are either are dating or are

523
00:32:11,740 --> 00:32:13,760
looking to be dating. If
the PR, I mean visits,

524
00:32:13,790 --> 00:32:16,630
it's a book that people are
reading all of the time. Um,

525
00:32:16,780 --> 00:32:18,280
and even if they aren't reading,
then you know,

526
00:32:18,281 --> 00:32:21,700
you can really wow them with just your
knowledge of contemporary contemporary

527
00:32:21,701 --> 00:32:25,180
literature and to say nothing of your
concern for the people who are struggling

528
00:32:25,181 --> 00:32:29,830
in America and abroad. So I'm really
that, that's a big plug. And um,

529
00:32:30,130 --> 00:32:32,170
it's also one of, it's
one, a bunch of awards.

530
00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:35,470
It was a finalist for at least one of
finals towards a final finalist for the

531
00:32:35,471 --> 00:32:39,830
national book critics Circle Award for
fiction, which I think is good. Um,

532
00:32:39,860 --> 00:32:42,800
and the guy from Barnes and noble would
not let me leave the counter because he

533
00:32:42,801 --> 00:32:47,060
liked it so much and he's a good judge.
So, um, those are some really good plugs.

534
00:32:47,061 --> 00:32:48,680
But as far as weakness,

535
00:32:48,681 --> 00:32:51,230
you might notice it's a little bit
bigger than some of the other books that

536
00:32:51,231 --> 00:32:55,940
we've read. But I promise you that
that's okay if you fly through the pages.

537
00:32:56,210 --> 00:32:58,010
And just to give you a
sense of why you do that.

538
00:32:58,190 --> 00:33:00,380
I'll read 'em to you a
section from the book.

539
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,820
It's actually the last
paragraph of the book, but this,

540
00:33:04,880 --> 00:33:08,210
it's not like one of those sports I like.
And then your mother died. No, it's um,

541
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:08,840
this is,

542
00:33:08,840 --> 00:33:12,140
it actually really I think is very fitting
to read now because it's kind of his

543
00:33:12,141 --> 00:33:14,090
plug for why you should read his book,

544
00:33:14,180 --> 00:33:18,620
or at least it's a description of why
he tells his story. So here we go. Um,

545
00:33:19,280 --> 00:33:23,000
whatever I do, however I find a way
to live, I will tell these stories.

546
00:33:23,240 --> 00:33:26,330
I've spoken to every person I've
encountered these last difficult days.

547
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,930
And every person who is an entered this
club during these awful morning hours

548
00:33:29,990 --> 00:33:32,390
because to do anything else would
be something less than human.

549
00:33:32,720 --> 00:33:36,080
I speak to these people and I speak
to you because I cannot help it.

550
00:33:36,380 --> 00:33:40,370
It gives me strength, almost unbelievable
strength to know that you are there.

551
00:33:40,760 --> 00:33:44,060
I covet your eyes, your ears,
the collapsible space between us.

552
00:33:44,270 --> 00:33:47,780
How blessed are we to have each other.
I'm alive and you are alive,

553
00:33:47,840 --> 00:33:51,920
so we must fill the air with our
words. I will feel today, tomorrow,

554
00:33:51,950 --> 00:33:54,470
everyday until I am taken back to God.

555
00:33:54,950 --> 00:33:58,190
I will tell these stories to people who
will listen and to people who don't want

556
00:33:58,191 --> 00:34:02,000
to listen to people who seek me out
and to those who run all the while,

557
00:34:02,001 --> 00:34:05,450
I will know that you are there.
How can I pretend that you do not exist?

558
00:34:05,630 --> 00:34:10,370
It would be almost as impossible as you
pretending that I do not exist. Thanks.

559
00:34:11,150 --> 00:34:16,150
[inaudible].

560
00:34:17,810 --> 00:34:22,190
Okay. Vote. If this were
really a high tech classroom,

561
00:34:22,191 --> 00:34:26,540
we'd have a little console
for you and you'd be voting
online, but we don't. Okay,

562
00:34:26,541 --> 00:34:29,630
so okay.
Anyone need a ballot?

563
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:31,123
Thank you.

564
00:34:34,040 --> 00:34:38,930
Okay. Rank them. One, two, three.
Ta's get to vote to yes you do.

565
00:34:41,200 --> 00:34:42,033
Okay.

566
00:34:57,110 --> 00:35:00,710
And when you're finished, pass them to
the isles. Can I borrow your pencil?

567
00:35:00,850 --> 00:35:01,683
Okay,
sure.

568
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:07,010
I'm voting to

569
00:35:10,520 --> 00:35:15,520
[inaudible].

570
00:35:44,490 --> 00:35:45,750
Okay.
Everybody voted

571
00:35:47,490 --> 00:35:47,881
okay?

572
00:35:47,881 --> 00:35:52,881
Tfs everybody done fasten fasten over.

573
00:35:56,890 --> 00:35:57,723
Okay.

574
00:35:58,290 --> 00:35:59,700
We will see them in a moment.

575
00:36:03,070 --> 00:36:07,030
Well, let me say, uh, it, it's
a tough act to follow you guys.

576
00:36:07,031 --> 00:36:11,330
So congratulations to all the
people who pitched books. Um,

577
00:36:11,380 --> 00:36:16,380
although I have to say I'm a little
hurt at the implied criticism long,

578
00:36:18,250 --> 00:36:20,950
long, hard, hard board.

579
00:36:22,240 --> 00:36:24,940
I don't recognize my own syllabus.
Maybe the long,

580
00:36:24,941 --> 00:36:28,780
but I'm not the heart of
the boring. Um, so, uh,

581
00:36:29,050 --> 00:36:33,640
we will see what that next book will be.
Now I have exactly five minutes.

582
00:36:35,260 --> 00:36:36,460
So,
um,

583
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,560
what do you think I want to do is just
say something very quick about um,

584
00:36:41,650 --> 00:36:43,060
loss in this book.

585
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:49,450
I put this quote up on the board need
can blossom into all the compensation it

586
00:36:49,451 --> 00:36:50,284
requires.

587
00:36:50,320 --> 00:36:55,320
That little blurb I
think encapsulates this.

588
00:36:55,331 --> 00:36:58,090
Novels,
meditation on loss.

589
00:36:59,890 --> 00:37:04,660
I asked you last time to think
about where Ruth's voice comes from,

590
00:37:04,690 --> 00:37:07,030
what situation we can imagine.

591
00:37:07,270 --> 00:37:10,900
And there are bunch of different theories
that critics have put forward about

592
00:37:11,380 --> 00:37:14,830
where Ruth is in from where
we hear her voice coming.

593
00:37:15,460 --> 00:37:19,570
One is that she's dead and she's speaking
to us from the afterlife that she

594
00:37:19,571 --> 00:37:24,430
really somehow did die in the lake that
day that she fell off the bridge or

595
00:37:24,550 --> 00:37:29,550
somehow the bridge is a metaphor for her
passage into death or that this is an

596
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:35,881
adult Ruth living who knows where or
just as a transient who has written this

597
00:37:38,380 --> 00:37:40,990
account or who speaks to us somehow.

598
00:37:42,610 --> 00:37:47,610
I think that quotation from
Maryland Robinson that I
gave you at the end of last

599
00:37:48,221 --> 00:37:53,221
lecture about how she aims to speak in
the voice of the consciousness of the

600
00:37:55,271 --> 00:37:56,080
person,

601
00:37:56,080 --> 00:38:01,080
not necessarily the words that they
would use if they were to write their own

602
00:38:01,091 --> 00:38:01,924
account,

603
00:38:02,620 --> 00:38:07,620
suggest that what she's getting at
doesn't require that kind of historical

604
00:38:09,880 --> 00:38:12,160
explanation to account for it.

605
00:38:12,430 --> 00:38:17,430
That she doesn't want us to have to think
of Ruth's speaking from a particular

606
00:38:18,401 --> 00:38:19,234
place,

607
00:38:19,720 --> 00:38:24,720
which is also a way to
say that Ruth is gone.

608
00:38:26,680 --> 00:38:30,670
Somehow Ruth is absent from us.

609
00:38:32,020 --> 00:38:37,020
And this relates to my point last time
about identity is imagined as voice Ruth,

610
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,430
the historical Ruth,
the character Ruth, uh,

611
00:38:42,431 --> 00:38:47,431
Ruth that we could situate in any concrete
position in the world has vanished

612
00:38:49,840 --> 00:38:54,430
from the frame of this novel.
What we're left with is her voice.

613
00:38:55,510 --> 00:39:00,510
The logic here is that vanishing
makes the voice totally present,

614
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:06,990
that full human presence is
in the voice somehow inherent.

615
00:39:10,570 --> 00:39:15,570
That's why there are all these meditations
on what would happen if various

616
00:39:17,231 --> 00:39:20,560
people either did disappear
or didn't disappear.

617
00:39:20,770 --> 00:39:25,770
So when Ruth meditates on what it
would be like for her to leave Sylvie,

618
00:39:27,310 --> 00:39:28,510
she says,

619
00:39:29,260 --> 00:39:34,260
I did not want to grow gigantic
and multiple to Sylvie.

620
00:39:35,290 --> 00:39:38,110
Her senses that by leaving Sylvie,

621
00:39:38,920 --> 00:39:43,920
her absence would become enormous and she
herself in a kind of negative presence

622
00:39:46,540 --> 00:39:49,060
would become larger than she is.

623
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:53,110
And this is how Ruth feels about
her own mother's disappearance,

624
00:39:54,070 --> 00:39:56,560
that when her mother disappeared,

625
00:39:57,430 --> 00:40:02,290
what she got in return was
the compensation of memory.

626
00:40:02,350 --> 00:40:05,620
Sharp, specific, evocative,

627
00:40:05,680 --> 00:40:08,830
mysterious ever present memory.

628
00:40:09,550 --> 00:40:13,570
And the visual metaphor for this
kind of memory is of course the lake.

629
00:40:14,590 --> 00:40:19,590
The lake is imagined to
contain hole and under Cade,

630
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:23,320
all the objects of the past
that have been lost in it.

631
00:40:24,610 --> 00:40:29,610
So memories imagined in the same terms
so that you could always bring them up to

632
00:40:31,121 --> 00:40:33,460
the surface and there they would be whole.

633
00:40:34,990 --> 00:40:39,990
So the resurrection imagined if you run
the film backward of the train slipping

634
00:40:40,601 --> 00:40:43,390
into the lake,
I read that passage last time.

635
00:40:43,570 --> 00:40:48,550
The kind of resurrection
imagined is the way memory works.

636
00:40:48,730 --> 00:40:53,050
But more specifically,
it's the way the language of memory works.

637
00:40:53,980 --> 00:40:58,540
And I want to read, um, my
own, uh, favorite passage.

638
00:40:58,660 --> 00:41:02,680
Uh,
this is at the very end of the novel.

639
00:41:02,710 --> 00:41:07,710
And I want you to think as I read it
about the difference between this passage

640
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,660
and the one I read from
bluest eye about Pichola,

641
00:41:13,690 --> 00:41:18,690
that passage of negativity about her being
a kind of blank or a negative against

642
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:23,170
which all other virtues could
be present in the world.

643
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:28,200
So think about that as I read this
bottom of two 17 since we are dead,

644
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:33,440
the house would be hers now hers Lucile,

645
00:41:34,760 --> 00:41:39,740
perhaps she's in the kitchen snuggling
pretty daughters in her lap and perhaps

646
00:41:39,741 --> 00:41:44,150
now and then they look at the black window
to find out what their mothers seems

647
00:41:44,151 --> 00:41:48,080
to see there and they see
their own faces and a face.

648
00:41:48,081 --> 00:41:53,081
So like their mothers so wrapped and
full of tender watching that only Lucile

649
00:41:53,540 --> 00:41:58,040
could think of the face was mine.
If Lucille is there,

650
00:41:58,041 --> 00:42:03,041
Sylvia and I have stood outside her
window a thousand times and we have thrown

651
00:42:03,261 --> 00:42:07,820
the side door open when she was upstairs
changing beds and we have brought in

652
00:42:07,821 --> 00:42:12,821
leaves and flung the curtains and tip
the bud vase and somehow left the house

653
00:42:12,861 --> 00:42:17,861
again before she could run downstairs
leaving behind us a strong smell of lake

654
00:42:18,201 --> 00:42:22,190
water. She would sign and
think they never change.

655
00:42:23,240 --> 00:42:28,240
Or Imagine Lucille in Boston at a table
in a restaurant waiting for a friend.

656
00:42:29,150 --> 00:42:34,150
She is tastefully dressed wearing say
a tweed suit with an amber scarf at the

657
00:42:34,821 --> 00:42:39,020
throat to draw attention to
the red in her darkening hair.

658
00:42:39,470 --> 00:42:44,120
Her water glass has left two thirds of
a ring on the table and she works at

659
00:42:44,121 --> 00:42:46,580
completing the circle with her thumbnail.

660
00:42:47,330 --> 00:42:52,330
Sylvie and I do not flounce in through
the door smoothing the skirts of are

661
00:42:52,581 --> 00:42:57,290
oversized coats and combing
our hair back with our fingers.

662
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,800
We do not sit down at the table next to
hers and empty our pockets in a small

663
00:43:03,771 --> 00:43:08,771
damp peep in the middle of the table
and sort out the gum wrappers and ticket

664
00:43:09,081 --> 00:43:14,081
stubs and add up the coins and dollar
bills and laugh and add them again.

665
00:43:15,530 --> 00:43:18,320
My mother likewise is not there.

666
00:43:18,380 --> 00:43:23,000
And my grandmother in her house slippers
with her pig tail wagging and my

667
00:43:23,001 --> 00:43:27,050
grandfather with his hair
combed flat against his brow,

668
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:30,650
does not examine the menu
with studious interest.

669
00:43:31,130 --> 00:43:35,090
We are nowhere in Boston,
however,

670
00:43:35,091 --> 00:43:36,710
Lucille may look,

671
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:41,270
she will never find us
there or any trace or sign.

672
00:43:41,810 --> 00:43:46,810
We pause nowhere in Boston even to admire
a store window and the perimeters of

673
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:50,240
our wandering are nowhere.

674
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:56,030
No one watching this woman smear her
initials in the steam on her water glass

675
00:43:56,031 --> 00:44:00,590
with her first finger or slip cellophane
packets of oyster crackers into her

676
00:44:00,591 --> 00:44:05,591
handbag for the seagulls could know how
her thoughts are thronged by our absence

677
00:44:07,010 --> 00:44:11,030
or know how she does not watch,
does not listen,

678
00:44:11,510 --> 00:44:14,090
does not wait,
does not hope.

679
00:44:14,510 --> 00:44:17,540
And always for me and Sylvie.

680
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:25,200
So you see in that incredibly
lyrical evo cation of absence,

681
00:44:26,210 --> 00:44:31,210
how the very absence calls
forth this lyric voice,

682
00:44:33,300 --> 00:44:38,300
the structure is exactly the same as the
one that Morrison uses to describe what

683
00:44:38,311 --> 00:44:43,311
Pichola is to Claudia and Frieda
and the rest of their community.

684
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:49,640
It's a way in which absence calls forth
the living essence of other people.

685
00:44:52,350 --> 00:44:56,970
But here what's called forth is a
sort of living essence of imagination,

686
00:44:57,300 --> 00:44:59,130
a living essence of voice.

687
00:45:00,270 --> 00:45:05,270
So that Sylvie and Ruth's absence for
Lucille becomes the very presence that

688
00:45:09,211 --> 00:45:10,500
they have to her.

689
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:15,390
There's a passage earlier
in the novel where

690
00:45:17,790 --> 00:45:19,290
she describes

691
00:45:22,140 --> 00:45:27,140
the condition of the body that matches
up with this understanding of absence.

692
00:45:28,410 --> 00:45:33,300
She's outside in the orchard.
This is on two oh three,

693
00:45:38,010 --> 00:45:40,170
imagining, uh, the hair,

694
00:45:40,230 --> 00:45:45,160
the story of a young girl in a
lighted house that she sees her.

695
00:45:45,161 --> 00:45:48,390
Ha, uh, let's see. It would be that
kind of story of very melancholy story.

696
00:45:48,600 --> 00:45:49,141
Her hair,

697
00:45:49,141 --> 00:45:53,760
which was as black as the sky and so long
that it swept after her a wind in the

698
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:55,260
grass,
her fingers,

699
00:45:55,410 --> 00:46:00,000
which were sky black and so fine and
slender that they were only cold touch,

700
00:46:00,001 --> 00:46:02,130
like drops of rain.
Her step,

701
00:46:02,280 --> 00:46:06,480
which was so silent that
people were surprised when
they even thought they heard

702
00:46:06,481 --> 00:46:07,110
it.

703
00:46:07,110 --> 00:46:12,110
She would be transformed by the gross
light into a mortal child and when she

704
00:46:13,831 --> 00:46:17,610
stood at the bright window,
she would find that the world was gone.

705
00:46:18,330 --> 00:46:22,920
The orchard was gone. Her mother
and grandmother and aunts were gone.

706
00:46:23,220 --> 00:46:26,550
Like Noah's wife on the
10th or 15th night of rain,

707
00:46:26,700 --> 00:46:31,260
she would stand in the window and realize
that the world was really lost and

708
00:46:31,261 --> 00:46:33,630
those outside would scarcely know her.

709
00:46:33,810 --> 00:46:38,810
So sadly was she changed before she
had been flashed in air and clothed in

710
00:46:40,231 --> 00:46:45,231
nakedness and mantled in Cla in cold and
her very bones were only slender things

711
00:46:45,991 --> 00:46:50,040
like shafts of ice. She had haunted
the orchard out of preference,

712
00:46:50,190 --> 00:46:54,960
but she could walk into the lake without
ripple or displacement and sail up the

713
00:46:54,961 --> 00:46:59,250
air invisibly as heat
and now lost to her kind.

714
00:46:59,251 --> 00:47:04,251
She would almost forget them and she
would feed course food to her course flesh

715
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:07,290
and be almost satisfied.

716
00:47:07,470 --> 00:47:12,470
And then Ruth meditates
on her transformation in
that time in the orchard.

717
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:17,520
If I had stayed there, I might have
discovered other things. For example,

718
00:47:17,850 --> 00:47:22,850
I was hungry enough to begin to learn
that hunger has its pleasures and I was

719
00:47:23,521 --> 00:47:27,570
happily at ease in the dark and in general
I could feel that I was breaking the

720
00:47:27,571 --> 00:47:31,510
tethers of need. One one, what I would,

721
00:47:31,660 --> 00:47:34,300
I would call this an anorexic aesthetic.

722
00:47:36,370 --> 00:47:41,370
It's an aesthetic of starving the self
into invisibility so that the voice can

723
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,730
become present.
So in this scene,

724
00:47:45,790 --> 00:47:50,790
when she imagines the girl inside
the house eating all that outside,

725
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:53,860
the houses lost,

726
00:47:54,280 --> 00:47:58,150
all she can see when she looks out
her window is her own reflection.

727
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:01,630
But outside the house

728
00:48:03,160 --> 00:48:07,870
she is starved into a kind of ethereal,

729
00:48:07,871 --> 00:48:09,100
full presence.

730
00:48:10,180 --> 00:48:12,970
So the logic of absence,

731
00:48:13,090 --> 00:48:16,600
to bring it back round to this question
of identity and the identity of the

732
00:48:16,601 --> 00:48:17,320
voice,

733
00:48:17,320 --> 00:48:22,320
the logic of absence starves away the
person so that this fullness can appear,

734
00:48:25,810 --> 00:48:30,810
and I think this is the dark side of a
novel that so many people initially read

735
00:48:34,780 --> 00:48:36,820
as a feminist novel,

736
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:41,590
a novel celebrating the strength
and the independence of women.

737
00:48:42,550 --> 00:48:47,550
It turns to an aesthetic that has
a kind of purchase in our culture.

738
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:54,390
That sense of anorexia blends into the
spiritual fullness of imagining memory as

739
00:48:58,991 --> 00:49:00,970
this beautiful,
lyrical presence.

740
00:49:01,960 --> 00:49:05,560
I think this is the complexity of
this novel. This is the tension.

741
00:49:05,830 --> 00:49:07,810
It's also in many ways it's beauty.

742
00:49:08,770 --> 00:49:11,710
So now I believe we have an answer.

743
00:49:14,500 --> 00:49:19,090
Jonathan Safran Foer that
will be our novel. Eli,

744
00:49:19,510 --> 00:49:20,530
congratulations.

745
00:49:20,531 --> 00:49:25,531
[inaudible].

746
00:49:26,260 --> 00:49:28,390
Thank you very much.
Have a wonderful break.
