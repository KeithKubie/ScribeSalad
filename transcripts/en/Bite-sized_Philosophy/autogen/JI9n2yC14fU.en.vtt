annoyed about that and I thought right
 

00:03:33.260 --> 00:03:35.440 align:start position:0%
annoyed about that and I thought right
that's<00:03:33.860><c> what</c><00:03:34.130><c> you</c><00:03:34.310><c> do</c><00:03:34.550><c> you</c><00:03:34.790><c> just</c><00:03:34.820><c> opened</c><00:03:35.420><c> your</c>

00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:35.450 align:start position:0%
that's what you do you just opened your
 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.000 align:start position:0%
that's what you do you just opened your
hands<00:03:35.960><c> well</c><00:03:36.170><c> she</c><00:03:36.350><c> didn't</c><00:03:36.530><c> know</c><00:03:36.620><c> that</c><00:03:36.800><c> either</c>

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:37.010 align:start position:0%
hands well she didn't know that either
 

00:03:37.010 --> 00:03:38.800 align:start position:0%
hands well she didn't know that either
so<00:03:37.340><c> she</c><00:03:37.820><c> hadn't</c><00:03:38.030><c> been</c><00:03:38.060><c> played</c><00:03:38.360><c> with</c><00:03:38.570><c> enough</c>

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:38.810 align:start position:0%
so she hadn't been played with enough
 

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:43.480 align:start position:0%
so she hadn't been played with enough
when<00:03:38.990><c> she</c><00:03:39.110><c> was</c><00:03:39.230><c> a</c><00:03:39.260><c> little</c><00:03:39.350><c> rat</c><00:03:39.710><c> and</c><00:03:40.310><c> so</c><00:03:42.490><c> anyways</c>

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:43.490 align:start position:0%
when she was a little rat and so anyways
 

00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:47.290 align:start position:0%
when she was a little rat and so anyways
uh<00:03:44.590><c> anyway</c><00:03:45.590><c> so</c><00:03:45.650><c> you</c><00:03:46.250><c> let</c><00:03:46.430><c> the</c><00:03:46.580><c> rap</c><00:03:46.760><c> the</c><00:03:46.790><c> little</c>

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:47.300 align:start position:0%
uh anyway so you let the rap the little
 

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.790 align:start position:0%
uh anyway so you let the rap the little
rats<00:03:47.450><c> go</c><00:03:47.660><c> out</c><00:03:47.810><c> there</c><00:03:48.050><c> right</c><00:03:48.230><c> and</c><00:03:48.410><c> so</c><00:03:48.560><c> let's</c>

00:03:48.790 --> 00:03:48.800 align:start position:0%
rats go out there right and so let's
 

00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:50.080 align:start position:0%
rats go out there right and so let's
imagine<00:03:48.920><c> one</c><00:03:49.370><c> of</c><00:03:49.490><c> them</c><00:03:49.580><c> is</c><00:03:49.700><c> ten</c><00:03:49.910><c> percent</c>

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:50.090 align:start position:0%
imagine one of them is ten percent
 

00:03:50.090 --> 00:03:52.570 align:start position:0%
imagine one of them is ten percent
bigger<00:03:50.420><c> than</c><00:03:50.540><c> other</c><00:03:50.870><c> and</c><00:03:51.140><c> so</c><00:03:51.710><c> that</c><00:03:52.160><c> the</c><00:03:52.400><c> ten</c>

00:03:52.570 --> 00:03:52.580 align:start position:0%
bigger than other and so that the ten
 

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:55.030 align:start position:0%
bigger than other and so that the ten
percent<00:03:52.760><c> bigger</c><00:03:53.180><c> rat</c><00:03:53.450><c> wins</c><00:03:53.750><c> because</c><00:03:54.740><c> ten</c>

00:03:55.030 --> 00:03:55.040 align:start position:0%
percent bigger rat wins because ten
 

00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:57.220 align:start position:0%
percent bigger rat wins because ten
percent<00:03:55.400><c> is</c><00:03:55.520><c> enough</c><00:03:55.640><c> in</c><00:03:56.060><c> rat</c><00:03:56.240><c> way</c><00:03:56.450><c> to</c><00:03:56.510><c> ensure</c>

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.230 align:start position:0%
percent is enough in rat way to ensure
 

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:58.570 align:start position:0%
percent is enough in rat way to ensure
that<00:03:57.260><c> you're</c><00:03:57.560><c> going</c><00:03:57.650><c> to</c><00:03:57.740><c> be</c><00:03:57.890><c> the</c><00:03:58.040><c> Pinner</c>

00:03:58.570 --> 00:03:58.580 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be the Pinner
 

00:03:58.580 --> 00:04:01.570 align:start position:0%
that you're going to be the Pinner
rather<00:03:58.940><c> than</c><00:03:59.210><c> the</c><00:03:59.330><c> penny</c><00:03:59.540><c> okay</c><00:04:00.350><c> so</c><00:04:00.590><c> so</c><00:04:01.400><c> that's</c>

00:04:01.570 --> 00:04:01.580 align:start position:0%
rather than the penny okay so so that's
 

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:03.280 align:start position:0%
