00:00:01.895 --> 00:00:03.145
NICK JANKEL: Great to be here.

00:00:03.145 --> 00:00:06.180
I'm very privileged to
share some ideas with you.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.100
I'm going to give you the top
slice of about 20 years work

00:00:10.100 --> 00:00:13.290
as a committed
philosopher, thinker.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.840
And I spent 16 years
as an entrepreneur.

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.450
I started my first company
when I was 24 in London

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:20.390
after reading "The
Cluetrain Manifesto,"

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:22.930
and realizing that all
markets are conversations,

00:00:22.930 --> 00:00:24.740
they're not full of consumers.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.710
And that created a whole
wave of innovation for me.

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:32.540
This is part talk,
part experience,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:36.370
and it's based around the
book I've just published,

00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:41.030
which you've got a copy
of, which is great.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.830
And it's about how to have
and sustain breakthroughs

00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:47.250
in yourself, your life, but
also in your enterprise.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.370
And hopefully,
inspiring you to look

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.670
at how to break through
problems in the world,

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:54.310
really connecting my
change as an individual

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:57.461
with the changes we want to
see out there in the world.

00:00:57.461 --> 00:00:59.710
I'll give you bit more about
my life and my background

00:00:59.710 --> 00:01:01.210
as we go along.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:03.920
But as you're
Googlers, super smart,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:08.350
I'm going to give you a
little question, a challenge.

00:01:08.350 --> 00:01:14.305
So put your hand up when you
have solved this anagram.

00:01:26.171 --> 00:01:26.920
Come on, Googlers.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:34.190
OK, we've got one.

00:01:38.164 --> 00:01:39.740
A couple more.

00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:41.820
Another one.

00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:42.320
All right.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:44.482
Do you want to share it with us?

00:01:44.482 --> 00:01:45.190
AUDIENCE: Cubism?

00:01:45.190 --> 00:01:46.220
NICK JANKEL: Cubism.

00:01:46.220 --> 00:01:48.340
Right.

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:51.537
About 30 people, not
many got it, right?

00:01:51.537 --> 00:01:53.870
Actually, you're actually one
of the highest percentages

00:01:53.870 --> 00:01:56.340
I've ever seen in a group.

00:01:56.340 --> 00:02:00.240
Usually 1%, 2% of the group get,
OK, in a short period of time.

00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.740
Whose brain, whose mind
was saying, over and over,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:04.894
"Be music, be music"?

00:02:04.894 --> 00:02:06.060
All right, put your hand up.

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.910
Let me know.

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:07.780
Right.

00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:09.800
That gives you a glimpse
of the challenges

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.740
we face as human beings
about how to break through.

00:02:12.740 --> 00:02:14.660
Because our mind likes
to hold on to what

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:19.430
we can see now, rather than take
the risk to go and embrace what

00:02:19.430 --> 00:02:20.475
might be.

00:02:20.475 --> 00:02:23.710
And we'll come back to that
theme as we go throughout.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.700
A little background about me.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.564
Started my career in
medicine, studying medicine,

00:02:28.564 --> 00:02:29.730
wanted to be a psychiatrist.

00:02:29.730 --> 00:02:32.280
And then flipped into
philosophy of science.

00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:34.630
Long story, I won't
give it to you now.

00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:36.214
I came out of
philosophy of science

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:39.600
with a good grounding in
social theory, human sciences,

00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.070
and natural sciences.

00:02:41.070 --> 00:02:43.470
And naturally, I go into
advertising, working

00:02:43.470 --> 00:02:45.910
for a very large ad agency,
working with PlayStation,

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:48.350
mainly, my first big client,
when they were very young.

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.060
And we helped grow them.

00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:53.200
As I said, 1999, I read
"The Cluetrain Manifesto."

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.700
I saw the digital
wave and was like,

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:57.199
I've got to get up on this wave,
because ad agencies are not

00:02:57.199 --> 00:02:58.150
on it at all.

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:02.620
Started up a tech-friendly
startup accelerator

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.800
mixed with marketing,
brand consultancy.

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.910
We then pivoted when
that industry dried up.

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:10.715
We pivoted in 2001 to
become an innovation agency,

00:03:10.715 --> 00:03:13.340
working with many of the largest
companies in the world on very

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:16.570
big projects to develop
7, 10 year products

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:18.550
services, et cetera.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:20.640
For reasons I will give
you a bit later on,

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.242
I then got into
social innovation more

00:03:22.242 --> 00:03:24.075
than commercial innovation,
although the two

00:03:24.075 --> 00:03:26.094
have become really
nicely connected

00:03:26.094 --> 00:03:27.510
at the moment,
which is beautiful,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:30.890
as more companies realize they
want to solve big problems, not

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:34.270
just small little
widget problems.

00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:38.410
And I realized over 15
years of doing this work,

00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.790
that leadership, empowerment,
individual psychology

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:46.339
and being, is actually the most
important thing in innovation.

00:03:46.339 --> 00:03:48.130
So I ended up getting
into leadership work.

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:50.380
I did a lot of leadership
work with large companies.

00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:53.280
And then have finally
come into myself

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.660
as a wisdom teacher,
which is a very posh term.

00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:56.570
I didn't really hear about
it until a few years ago.

00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:58.445
I was like, yes, that
sounds like something I

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:01.440
do-- teaching people how
to thrive in the world.

00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.000
Which as you can see,
kind of came full circle

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.220
to my first initial desire to be
psychiatrist when I was 15, 16.

00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:11.180
It's been a long
journey, not an easy one.

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:14.950
And I'll share a few
insights from my journey.

00:04:14.950 --> 00:04:17.550
So what connects all
my work-- so I work

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:19.200
with very large organizations.

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.190
I've worked with Number 10,
I've worked with the European

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.310
Commission, and then
working with individuals

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:26.537
on their own life.

00:04:26.537 --> 00:04:28.870
What connects them, is my
understanding of breakthrough,

00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:31.860
which I have recently coined
the term "Breakthrough

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.722
Biodynamics," and hopefully
you understand why,

00:04:34.722 --> 00:04:36.930
by the end of this talk,
why it's biodynamics and not

00:04:36.930 --> 00:04:39.090
just dynamics.

00:04:39.090 --> 00:04:40.650
So that's what holds
it all together.

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:44.640
I run three different
parts of that, if you,

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:47.350
like three strands, three
flavors of ice cream.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.370
The first, as myself
as a teacher, author,

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:53.880
and I did a couple of TV shows
as a present, more in the way.

00:04:53.880 --> 00:04:55.675
I run this innovation,
Conscious Innovation

00:04:55.675 --> 00:04:57.470
and Leadership Consultancy.

00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:00.580
And recently, about a year
ago, set up a new media

00:05:00.580 --> 00:05:04.120
company, kind of like the vice
magazine of positive wisdom

00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:04.790
content.

00:05:04.790 --> 00:05:06.206
That's the kind
of idea behind it.

00:05:06.206 --> 00:05:06.750
So big idea.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:08.279
Biggest idea I've ever had.

00:05:08.279 --> 00:05:10.570
So check that out if you're
interested in wisdom, world

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:13.100
change, and well-being content.

00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:16.820
And if anyone wants offer
their awesome Google ninjutsu,

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:18.940
I would love to hear.

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.300
Because creating a digital
content company in this world

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.800
is quite a trip.

00:05:24.800 --> 00:05:26.240
So, over to you.

00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:29.840
If you could break through
anything today in the next hour

00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:32.550
of your lives--
anything at all--

00:05:32.550 --> 00:05:34.000
have a think what it would be.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.060
Don't tell anyone.

00:05:35.060 --> 00:05:37.350
This is not a sharing session.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:39.792
Just have a think--
what would it be?

00:05:39.792 --> 00:05:41.500
It could be personal,
it could be career,

00:05:41.500 --> 00:05:44.300
it could be a work thing, it
could be a business problem

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.022
that you're tasked to face.

00:05:47.022 --> 00:05:49.230
Another way of asking that
question is, where are you

00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.880
feeling stuck or
stressed-- something

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:56.579
you can't quite seem to work
out how to get through it?

00:05:56.579 --> 00:05:58.370
Or, another way of
asking the same question

00:05:58.370 --> 00:05:59.750
is, where can you
see an opportunity,

00:05:59.750 --> 00:06:02.095
but you haven't worked out
how to seize the opportunity?

00:06:04.620 --> 00:06:06.620
Just have a think of
what that would be.

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.350
Go live.

00:06:08.350 --> 00:06:11.520
Don't do the dress
rehearsal of life.

00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:13.060
Let's take it down right now.

00:06:13.060 --> 00:06:14.720
So have that in
your mind as we go

00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.960
through the rest of
this conversation.

00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.330
So what is a breakthrough?

00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:20.309
It's a big word.

00:06:20.309 --> 00:06:22.100
People use the word
"disruptive innovation"

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.710
as one way of calling
it a breakthrough.

00:06:24.710 --> 00:06:27.200
"Epiphany" would be a
personal version of that.

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.090
So just a few examples
to get us in the mood.

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:34.400
So here's a painting, a sort
of Zenith of western realist

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.730
painting.

00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:36.730
Happens to be about war.

00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:38.820
And then this guy
came along and said,

00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:43.871
well, what if we did a
painting about war like that?

00:06:43.871 --> 00:06:45.370
And what's interesting
to me is, you

00:06:45.370 --> 00:06:47.740
could spend your whole life
getting better and better

00:06:47.740 --> 00:06:52.640
at painting a
realistic image of war,

00:06:52.640 --> 00:06:55.010
and never come up with that.

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:57.970
It's not a better
painting, to most people,

00:06:57.970 --> 00:06:59.786
certainly at the time.

00:06:59.786 --> 00:07:01.910
But this is one that's
famous, the other one isn't.

00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:03.990
This is one that's
worth gazillions,

00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:05.345
the other one isn't.

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:06.720
So it's something
to think about.

00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:10.350
In its time, as many
breakthrough creators find,

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.680
they're not appreciated
as much as they are when

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.246
life and the world moves on.

00:07:14.246 --> 00:07:16.120
And we'll come on to
why that is in a minute.

00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:17.286
Here's another breakthrough.

00:07:17.286 --> 00:07:21.170
This is Newton's cradle, basic
understanding of how physics

00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:23.430
works, Newtonian mechanics.

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:26.780
Everyone familiar with
Newtonian mechanics, vaguely?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:29.780
Basically, if you hit one
ball to another, it moves.

00:07:29.780 --> 00:07:32.501
And then this came
along-- quantum theory.

00:07:32.501 --> 00:07:34.750
Schrodinger's cat, et cetera,
Heisenberg's Uncertainty

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.640
Principle, which has now
shifted fundamentally on how

00:07:37.640 --> 00:07:39.550
everything in the world works.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:41.860
I'm sure some of you
in quantum computing,

00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.720
quantum biology, which is
fascinating stuff going

00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:45.690
on there.

00:07:45.690 --> 00:07:47.877
This kind of stuff is
happening all over the world.

00:07:47.877 --> 00:07:50.000
It was a total breakthrough.

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.070
And even now, when
the scientists come up

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:54.010
with new ideas,
a bit of research

00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:57.010
came out two years ago,
that out of 24 Nobel Prize

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.820
winners for science, all 24
had had their papers rejected

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:03.320
by scientific journals
for the discoveries

00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:06.360
that they later went on
to win the Nobel Prize.

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:10.150
That's the highest echelon of
breakthrough-- the resistance

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.030
from the existing
world to what you're

00:08:12.030 --> 00:08:14.065
trying to bring into, right?

00:08:14.065 --> 00:08:15.440
And the resistance
from yourself,

00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:16.830
which we'll come on to.

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:17.960
Anyone know what this is?

00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:22.680
Anyone know?

00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:23.530
Anyone know?

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:24.900
AUDIENCE: A video recorder?

00:08:24.900 --> 00:08:28.660
NICK JANKEL: The first
ever digital camera.

00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:29.510
I know.

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:31.950
A kind of ghetto-blasted
looking camera.

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:32.679
Invented by?

00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:36.559
Kodak.

00:08:36.559 --> 00:08:37.990
This guy.

00:08:37.990 --> 00:08:41.049
This says it already-- "My
prototype was big as a toaster.

00:08:41.049 --> 00:08:42.630
The technical people loved it.

00:08:42.630 --> 00:08:44.430
But it was film-less
photography.

00:08:44.430 --> 00:08:46.580
So management's reaction
was, that's cute.

00:08:46.580 --> 00:08:49.040
But don't tell anyone about it."

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:51.690
Why is that?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:52.190
Why?

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:53.529
AUDIENCE: They sell film.

00:08:53.529 --> 00:08:54.320
NICK JANKEL: Right.

00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:55.464
This model-- it's film.

00:08:55.464 --> 00:08:56.130
What about film?

00:08:56.130 --> 00:09:00.270
Who's printed a photo
out in the last year?

00:09:00.270 --> 00:09:02.985
Who's printed out more than 100?

00:09:02.985 --> 00:09:03.875
Hmm.

00:09:03.875 --> 00:09:06.030
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:06.030 --> 00:09:07.930
NICK JANKEL: Seeing a
collage, a big collage.

00:09:07.930 --> 00:09:08.830
So one person.

00:09:08.830 --> 00:09:12.560
You can't run a multinational
Fortune 50 company

00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:15.820
based upon one person using
film to any great degree.

00:09:15.820 --> 00:09:17.220
Right?

00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.710
These guys came along, and
many others, and totally

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:22.580
broke through the
industry of imagery.

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.880
Because they understood where
value lies in the emerging

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.610
future, not the past.

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:31.900
And they weren't
held back by being

00:09:31.900 --> 00:09:33.650
in digital-- in
film photography,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:36.520
in the film business, rather
than the image business.

00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:40.490
Instagram is in the
image-sharing business.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:43.070
Kodak was in the
printing business.

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.945
Very different thing.

00:09:43.945 --> 00:09:47.320
But what's fascinating to me
is, Kodak had all the MBAs, all

00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:49.630
the resources, all the
money, the cash part, access

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.090
to the city, access to
Wall Street, consultants,

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:58.100
ad agencies, and these
guys had nothing.

00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:01.790
So it's become very clear to
me that power in the present,

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.290
does not always
lead to breakthrough

00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:05.896
innovation in the future.

00:10:05.896 --> 00:10:08.020
And of course, we're standing
in a company that has

00:10:08.020 --> 00:10:10.520
massive power in the present.

00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:12.270
It is an interesting
conversation to have,

00:10:12.270 --> 00:10:15.094
because if I'd done this
talk at Kodak 20 years ago,

00:10:15.094 --> 00:10:16.510
people would be,
what do you mean?

00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:17.551
We're the market leaders.

00:10:17.551 --> 00:10:18.935
We have been for 50 years.

00:10:18.935 --> 00:10:21.410
It's fascinating.

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.140
Another example of this, Hilton,
the world's largest hotel

00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.130
group.

00:10:25.130 --> 00:10:27.390
Airbnb.

00:10:27.390 --> 00:10:30.136
Could have been started
by Hilton, easily.

00:10:30.136 --> 00:10:33.289
And look at this, though,
look at the market cap.

00:10:33.289 --> 00:10:34.330
This is a few months ago.

00:10:34.330 --> 00:10:37.270
It's actually now
even closer to Hilton.

00:10:37.270 --> 00:10:42.690
But what really interests me
is this-- 300,000 employees,

00:10:42.690 --> 00:10:45.280
versus 600 employees.

00:10:45.280 --> 00:10:48.200
And nothing stopped
Hilton creating Airbnb.

00:10:48.200 --> 00:10:48.700
Nothing.

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:50.741
There was no one with a
gun to their head saying,

00:10:50.741 --> 00:10:55.670
no way can you do
a sharing business.

00:10:55.670 --> 00:10:57.420
So why is this happening?

00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:00.130
Why are breakthroughs not
coming from companies with all

00:11:00.130 --> 00:11:02.710
these smarts and all the money?

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:04.965
And then how does this
play out in the real world

00:11:04.965 --> 00:11:06.200
of people and human beings?

00:11:06.200 --> 00:11:08.020
Well, you can imagine
going to prison

00:11:08.020 --> 00:11:10.500
has been quite a
challenging experience.

00:11:10.500 --> 00:11:13.800
This guy, famously,
was there for 27 years

00:11:13.800 --> 00:11:15.274
and said this about it.

00:11:15.274 --> 00:11:16.940
If I had not been in
prison, I would not

00:11:16.940 --> 00:11:19.450
have been able to achieve the
most difficult task in life,

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:21.687
and that is changing yourself.

00:11:21.687 --> 00:11:23.270
And he said very
clearly, he would not

00:11:23.270 --> 00:11:26.190
have been able to lead
South Africa to peace,

00:11:26.190 --> 00:11:27.700
unless he'd been in prison.

00:11:27.700 --> 00:11:29.770
He broke through a
problem and turned it

00:11:29.770 --> 00:11:31.790
into an opportunity,
a possibility.

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:37.442
Inside him-- not
immediately, but over time.

00:11:37.442 --> 00:11:39.275
So the bottom line is,
change is relentless.

00:11:39.275 --> 00:11:40.340
We know that.

00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.330
It's happening all the time.

00:11:42.330 --> 00:11:44.530
But you either fit the
world as it changes,

00:11:44.530 --> 00:11:45.580
or you no longer fit.

00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:49.090
You have a mismatch
between you and the world.

00:11:49.090 --> 00:11:53.450
And that's where things fail--
when there's a mismatch.

00:11:53.450 --> 00:11:57.370
So by understanding how
breakthroughs occur,

00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.840
you and me and other
people who understand

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:04.480
that anatomy can turn any
problem into possibility at

00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.080
will.

00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:05.913
And that's what I'm about.

00:12:05.913 --> 00:12:08.371
I'm in the business of helping
and empowering and inspiring

00:12:08.371 --> 00:12:10.120
guiding people to
be able to take

00:12:10.120 --> 00:12:14.220
any problem-- from
their loved one dying,

00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:17.120
to an addiction you've
got, to a business

00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:20.650
that's failing or starting the
beginning to fade away-- brand,

00:12:20.650 --> 00:12:23.730
in a problem, or whatever--
and understanding

00:12:23.730 --> 00:12:27.240
what you have to do to
be part of the future,

00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.829
and not fail because
you're stuck in the past.

00:12:29.829 --> 00:12:30.620
That's my business.

00:12:30.620 --> 00:12:32.036
So I'm hoping by
the end of today,

00:12:32.036 --> 00:12:34.620
you'll have a bit more
insight into that.

00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.630
So the bottom line
about creativity

00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:38.840
is it's not quite
what we think it is.

00:12:38.840 --> 00:12:39.590
So there's a myth.

00:12:39.590 --> 00:12:42.660
There's a myth that
creativity is linear.

00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.630
What I mean by linear is,
you start with a solution--

00:12:45.630 --> 00:12:47.640
I'm sorry, a problem.

00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:50.691
And it's a low, kind
of level of disorder.

00:12:50.691 --> 00:12:51.940
There's something a bit wrong.

00:12:51.940 --> 00:12:53.110
It's not quite good enough.

00:12:53.110 --> 00:12:56.920
You're surviving, it's not
quite where you want to be.

00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:59.010
And you walk along
a nice linear line,

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:01.440
making it better,
bit by bit by bit.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:03.142
And out comes a solution.

00:13:03.142 --> 00:13:04.350
What does that remind you of?

00:13:06.940 --> 00:13:08.179
A machine.

00:13:08.179 --> 00:13:09.220
That's how machines work.

00:13:09.220 --> 00:13:12.470
You put your foot on the
gas pedal of the car,

00:13:12.470 --> 00:13:14.370
and there is a
linear relationship

00:13:14.370 --> 00:13:20.300
between how much you
push, and how fast you go.

00:13:20.300 --> 00:13:21.680
But in life, that's
not the case.

00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.510
You can work really
hard at a problem.

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:26.480
You can go to
therapy for 10 years,

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.640
and still not have broken
through the problem,

00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:32.640
because breakthrough is
non-linear, because we

00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:36.330
are organisms, not algorithms.

00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.840
We are fundamentally wet,
hot, biological creatures.

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.380
And in fact, if you
go into the brain,

00:13:45.380 --> 00:13:48.020
something astonishing happens
when people being creative.

00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:50.145
So this is actually research
only a couple of years

00:13:50.145 --> 00:13:51.260
old, 18 months old.

00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:53.970
They put rappers
into fMRI scanners

00:13:53.970 --> 00:13:57.040
and asked them to
do different things.

00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:00.954
Group A-- read lyrics
you've already created.

00:14:00.954 --> 00:14:02.220
Right?

00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:03.790
Go through the motions.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:06.700
Being present, being cool,
delivering, performing.

00:14:06.700 --> 00:14:08.130
But you've created the lyrics.

00:14:08.130 --> 00:14:10.710
Or free-style.

00:14:10.710 --> 00:14:13.660
And the fascinating
thing is, in the brain

00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:16.602
of the people,
rappers, free-styling,

00:14:16.602 --> 00:14:18.060
the area of the
brain that we think

00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:22.439
is where all our
brilliant human reason

00:14:22.439 --> 00:14:24.230
comes from, the prefrontal
cortex the thing

00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:26.313
that's the biggest in
humans-- this whole bit here

00:14:26.313 --> 00:14:29.010
which makes us so clever, right?

00:14:29.010 --> 00:14:31.870
The kind of Greek idea of the
reason being this big shining

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:35.990
light of truth becomes
less active when

00:14:35.990 --> 00:14:39.720
you are spontaneously creating.

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:42.500
You have less control,
not more control.

00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:45.150
Less prefrontal
arousal a defocusing,

00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.620
not a focusing on the task
at hand, a defocusing away

00:14:48.620 --> 00:14:50.800
from the problem.

00:14:50.800 --> 00:14:55.140
The hub structures that keep
the brain all nicely regulated,

00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.580
if you like, start to
disintegrate, which again,

00:14:57.580 --> 00:15:00.160
recent research from Imperial,
the same thing happens

00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.700
when people take psychedelics,
the hub structures start

00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:05.020
to disintegrate,
more creativity.

00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:06.570
And the brain starts
cycling really

00:15:06.570 --> 00:15:09.920
fast between active,
passive, active, passive.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:14.080
In other words, you are
less smart-- technically,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:16.150
traditionally,
conventionally, smart--

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:20.400
when you're creating
than when you're not.

00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:23.140
It's a big thing to
remember in a world

00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:30.240
where we are usually awarded for
being clever in a linear way.

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:36.340
Pushing the sales 3%
more, pushing the brand,

00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:39.050
measures, 10% more,
whatever that is.

00:15:39.050 --> 00:15:40.690
Right?

00:15:40.690 --> 00:15:43.260
So what you realize is
that creativity is not

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:47.190
a straight line, it's
actually a curve.

00:15:47.190 --> 00:15:48.520
It's a J-shaped curve.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:53.480
You start with the
problem, then you go down

00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:56.740
and you start having beginnings
of ideas that may or may not

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.050
work.

00:15:58.050 --> 00:16:01.770
And then eventually, you
get a solution at the top.

00:16:01.770 --> 00:16:04.210
And the solution is
usually a lot better

00:16:04.210 --> 00:16:05.660
than the problem was.

00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:07.510
But you don't get there
until you go down.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:08.830
So I want to unpack
this for you now,

00:16:08.830 --> 00:16:10.110
because this is one of the
most important things I've ever

00:16:10.110 --> 00:16:11.710
learned in my life.

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:13.400
Just bear in mind,
I've run probably

00:16:13.400 --> 00:16:18.290
150 to 200 world-class
innovation projects designed

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:21.200
brief, specifically to come
up with big new business model

00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.077
ideas, usually.

00:16:23.077 --> 00:16:25.160
And this is always the
process, and there's always

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.290
a period here, where the client
says, so what's the solution?

00:16:28.290 --> 00:16:30.050
I go, I don't know.

00:16:30.050 --> 00:16:30.690
No one knows.

00:16:30.690 --> 00:16:32.660
If we knew, it
would be creativity.

00:16:32.660 --> 00:16:36.450
We just do the thing
we already knew.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:40.350
And companies don't like
this, for obvious reasons.

00:16:40.350 --> 00:16:41.610
People don't like it, either.

00:16:41.610 --> 00:16:43.620
And we'll come on to
more about why that is.

00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.770
So what happens is,
as the world changes,

00:16:45.770 --> 00:16:51.020
we notice a mismatch between
us or enterprise in the world.

00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:54.470
So you might have noticed a
mismatch recently in Apple

00:16:54.470 --> 00:16:55.356
and the world, OK?

00:16:55.356 --> 00:16:57.230
There are things Apple
are doing that are not

00:16:57.230 --> 00:16:59.320
matching where the world is.

00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.820
They spent 20 years being
ahead of where the world is,

00:17:02.820 --> 00:17:05.660
and now I sense they're
starting to come behind

00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:09.130
where the world is in
various different areas.

00:17:09.130 --> 00:17:10.329
I can sense it.

00:17:10.329 --> 00:17:12.650
I'm sure many people do.

00:17:12.650 --> 00:17:14.630
So when you switch
on, you consciously

00:17:14.630 --> 00:17:18.099
decide to go into that
state to spontaneity,

00:17:18.099 --> 00:17:21.670
where the brain is less
controlled than it was before,

00:17:21.670 --> 00:17:23.020
which increases your creativity.

00:17:23.020 --> 00:17:25.329
And that can be done
over a few series

00:17:25.329 --> 00:17:29.010
of workshops or meditations or
coaching sessions, whatever.

00:17:29.010 --> 00:17:30.701
Then you have your breakthrough.

00:17:30.701 --> 00:17:32.200
Then you come up
with lots of ideas,

00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:34.580
usually driven by purpose,
which is a big idea

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:36.330
and it's really
important to understand

00:17:36.330 --> 00:17:39.350
what your purpose is, what
this organization's purpose is.

00:17:39.350 --> 00:17:41.730
Then you start to rewire
yourself over time.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.912
It takes a long
time, it's not easy.

00:17:43.912 --> 00:17:45.370
This is just one
part of the thing.

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:47.172
The breakthrough
is the easy bit.

00:17:47.172 --> 00:17:49.630
Building it into your business,
building it into your life,

00:17:49.630 --> 00:17:52.550
is where things get
really challenging.

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.100
And then you get the
results you are looking for.

00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.590
Has anyone actually
recognized this experience

00:17:57.590 --> 00:18:01.680
in a transformation they've ever
had in their life in any area?

00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:04.415
That things got
difficult first-- maybe

00:18:04.415 --> 00:18:07.720
you had burnout, stress,
worried, you freaked out,

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.870
you left your job,
the project collapsed.

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:13.020
And then something came
out and you followed it,

00:18:13.020 --> 00:18:16.824
and then you build something
new over long period of time.

00:18:16.824 --> 00:18:17.990
And finally you got the win.

00:18:20.417 --> 00:18:22.000
And that's what this
win is here, what

00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:23.291
I call the thrive differential.

00:18:23.291 --> 00:18:25.510
The ability-- the amount
you're willing to go down

00:18:25.510 --> 00:18:27.230
to get the up.

00:18:27.230 --> 00:18:29.740
I believe that will predict
the quality of your life

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:30.730
in the future.

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:33.280
How much you're willing
to lose control, to let

00:18:33.280 --> 00:18:35.400
go, to get that.

00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:38.141
Because the other option
is, you notice the mismatch,

00:18:38.141 --> 00:18:40.640
you don't do anything about it,
you try and stay in control,

00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:42.850
you try to keep your shit
together and stuff down.

00:18:42.850 --> 00:18:44.710
I'm not going to change.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:46.320
I don't care that
my world's moving on

00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.819
and my relationship
are failing, I'm

00:18:47.819 --> 00:18:51.270
just going to hunker down and
hope it all changes around me.

00:18:51.270 --> 00:18:54.031
They have to change, not me.

00:18:54.031 --> 00:18:55.030
Stuck in a comfort zone.

00:18:55.030 --> 00:18:56.930
The world moves on.

00:18:56.930 --> 00:18:57.874
You become irrelevant.

00:18:57.874 --> 00:18:59.290
The enterprise
becomes irrelevant.

00:18:59.290 --> 00:19:01.430
And you enter a
breakdown, ultimately.

00:19:01.430 --> 00:19:03.180
Which can look like
something spectacular,

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:05.055
like mine, when I burnt
out and couldn't even

00:19:05.055 --> 00:19:06.160
go to work for a year.

00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:09.750
Or, it can look like a
slow decay of a business

00:19:09.750 --> 00:19:12.970
and gets bought by someone else.

00:19:12.970 --> 00:19:14.580
Various ways of doing.

00:19:14.580 --> 00:19:16.107
So here's the
individual version,

00:19:16.107 --> 00:19:17.940
which is what's in the
book, these 10 steps.

00:19:17.940 --> 00:19:20.090
Each chapter in the
book is one step.

00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:21.980
And this is my one
example for me.

00:19:21.980 --> 00:19:23.020
I had this burnout.

00:19:23.020 --> 00:19:24.290
Big problem.

00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:25.150
But I went into it.

00:19:25.150 --> 00:19:26.816
I was like, why is
this happening to me?

00:19:26.816 --> 00:19:29.040
Why I have some kind of
low-level clinical depression

00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:34.150
stress, up and down mood
swings, since I was 14, 15?

00:19:34.150 --> 00:19:35.982
Went into it.

00:19:35.982 --> 00:19:37.940
I realized a couple of
really important things.

00:19:37.940 --> 00:19:39.570
I was running a great company.

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:40.750
I had 50 staff.

00:19:40.750 --> 00:19:42.790
I was multimillion paper.

00:19:42.790 --> 00:19:45.820
I had gold cards of every
description, black cards.

00:19:45.820 --> 00:19:47.117
Whatever's going on.

00:19:47.117 --> 00:19:48.700
But it was built
around something that

00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:49.850
wasn't that wasn't my purpose.

00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:51.516
It was built around
my ego and my desire

00:19:51.516 --> 00:19:52.760
to be rich and famous.

00:19:52.760 --> 00:19:54.750
And it just wasn't
working for me.

00:19:54.750 --> 00:19:57.690
But more than that, I realized
I was building a business

00:19:57.690 --> 00:20:02.510
around using my talents
and transformation to find

00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:07.030
the part of you as consumers
where you are feeling

00:20:07.030 --> 00:20:12.010
a little weak, a little
unsure, flick it, and say

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:17.240
if you buy this product we just
invented, you'll be all right.

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:19.710
And it kind of moment
of huge discovery,

00:20:19.710 --> 00:20:23.070
I realized that I had to
flip that, and use my skills

00:20:23.070 --> 00:20:25.610
and transformation in
creativity and breakthrough

00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.674
to persuade everyone that
by going inside and dealing

00:20:28.674 --> 00:20:30.840
with yourself, you will
realize that you are already

00:20:30.840 --> 00:20:32.300
absolutely enough.

00:20:32.300 --> 00:20:35.010
And with that abundance
of creativity,

00:20:35.010 --> 00:20:38.630
you can go about making
the world a better place.

00:20:38.630 --> 00:20:40.970
Because people who are
living in stress and in fear

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:43.700
tend not to be able to go out
and solve their communities'

00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:45.320
problems.

00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:47.600
The two things are interrelated.

00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.865
So I realized I had a broken
heart with my own career.

00:20:49.865 --> 00:20:51.990
I'd built a company that
was breaking my own heart.

00:20:51.990 --> 00:20:54.380
I wanted to be a psychiatrist,
and I'm now doing

00:20:54.380 --> 00:20:55.500
marketing and advertising.

00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:57.590
I mean, it's like a total flip.

00:20:57.590 --> 00:20:59.186
So I unwound the whole thing.

00:20:59.186 --> 00:21:00.560
I exited my own
company, which is

00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.990
kind of crazy-- without
the money, by the way.

00:21:04.990 --> 00:21:09.850
Much to the chagrin out of
my accountant and my family.

00:21:09.850 --> 00:21:10.850
They thought I was nuts.

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:12.850
Bear in mind, I'd already
left a medical career.

00:21:12.850 --> 00:21:16.720
a high-flying medical
career at Cambridge, at UCL.

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:18.780
So there's this Jewish
family, first child

00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.721
to go into university,
and they're like, oh,

00:21:21.721 --> 00:21:24.220
but you left med-- but then you
got this business thing, OK.

00:21:24.220 --> 00:21:25.070
Now what are you doing?

00:21:25.070 --> 00:21:26.861
You're 30 years old,
and now you don't even

00:21:26.861 --> 00:21:29.780
have the business you
just built. Right?

00:21:29.780 --> 00:21:33.030
That's the reality of
when you change things.

00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:35.100
And then I have
now worked out how

00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.670
to build two businesses
around my purpose.

00:21:37.670 --> 00:21:40.225
But I'm no longer in
the official world's way

00:21:40.225 --> 00:21:41.100
of looking at things.

00:21:41.100 --> 00:21:42.980
My business is no
longer worth anything

00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:45.760
like my first business was.

00:21:45.760 --> 00:21:50.050
But I'm thriving, at the
edge of my life in all areas.

00:21:50.050 --> 00:21:51.690
And that is priceless.

00:21:51.690 --> 00:21:54.826
And here's the version
we use for companies.

00:21:54.826 --> 00:21:56.200
Here's a very
clever tool that we

00:21:56.200 --> 00:21:58.304
use to break through
corporate problems.

00:21:58.304 --> 00:22:00.220
And here's the version
we use in storytelling,

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:02.550
which is another area
where this comes out.

00:22:05.420 --> 00:22:09.570
So I have now begun to find
this J-curve everywhere.

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:12.119
And I'm actually developing
another book on this topic,

00:22:12.119 --> 00:22:12.910
about this J-curve.

00:22:12.910 --> 00:22:13.240
What is it?

00:22:13.240 --> 00:22:15.190
Because I've found it
in chemical reactions,

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:16.770
learning curves,
narrative structure.

00:22:16.770 --> 00:22:20.290
All Hollywood scripts
follow this J-curve.

00:22:20.290 --> 00:22:23.544
Not usually Danish outre movies.

00:22:23.544 --> 00:22:25.585
They sort of come down
here, and come round there

00:22:25.585 --> 00:22:27.740
and leave you going, I
don't know where I am.

00:22:27.740 --> 00:22:28.615
A couple investment.

00:22:28.615 --> 00:22:30.030
You invest in a company.

00:22:30.030 --> 00:22:31.770
It loses money.

00:22:31.770 --> 00:22:34.180
Hopefully it starts to
make money and come out,

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:36.680
but it's a big risk, as we
know from the VC industry.

00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:39.640
Scientific revolutions,
if anyone read any Kuhn,

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:40.830
follow the same thing.

00:22:40.830 --> 00:22:42.880
Political change,
if you're Egypt,

00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:45.700
you're in democracy-- you're
not in democracy with Mubarak.

00:22:45.700 --> 00:22:48.760
You want to be a stable
democracy like America,

00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:50.609
but it's not going
to be linear, guys.

00:22:50.609 --> 00:22:52.150
You're going to have
to disintegrate.

00:22:52.150 --> 00:22:53.524
And that's what's
happening here.

00:22:53.524 --> 00:22:59.170
But people don't realize that
this can be lead, this change.

00:22:59.170 --> 00:23:01.650
But if you assume is
linear, and you're not

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:06.670
ready to help a country
disintegrate elegantly,

00:23:06.670 --> 00:23:09.552
without violence and pain
and suffering, you have what

00:23:09.552 --> 00:23:11.260
happens in Egypt now,
which is going back

00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.890
up the left-hand side again.

00:23:12.890 --> 00:23:14.750
Because it's like,
we'll if we're here,

00:23:14.750 --> 00:23:17.440
we know what that is, and it's
a long road to build this,

00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:19.280
and no one's helping us.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.170
Let's just go back there.

00:23:21.170 --> 00:23:25.050
Millions of people's lives
are changed because of this.

00:23:25.050 --> 00:23:28.195
So, long story short, creativity
is in your DNA right now.

00:23:28.195 --> 00:23:30.320
Who thinks of themselves
as a very creative person?

00:23:32.940 --> 00:23:35.780
You're in marketing and sales,
so I imagine more than usual.

00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:38.240
But still, two or three people
have put their hands up.

00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:42.130
Believe me, every gene in your
body is fundamentally creative.

00:23:42.130 --> 00:23:44.302
Every bit of research I've
read in the last 10 years

00:23:44.302 --> 00:23:45.760
has basically said
we all are wired

00:23:45.760 --> 00:23:49.320
for creativity, collaboration,
compassion, curiosity,

00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:50.962
and caring.

00:23:50.962 --> 00:23:52.420
Monkeys do it, two
year olds do it,

00:23:52.420 --> 00:23:57.280
but somehow, something
happens, and we're

00:23:57.280 --> 00:23:59.780
less creative and collaborative
than we are when we're kids.

00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.650
I've got a three
and six year old

00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:02.816
and they just want to do
everything together, create

00:24:02.816 --> 00:24:04.999
everything, change everything.

00:24:04.999 --> 00:24:06.790
So why do so many of
us find it challenging

00:24:06.790 --> 00:24:08.164
to break through
our challenges--

00:24:08.164 --> 00:24:10.010
whether that's losing
weight, whether that's

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:12.070
stopping drinking
wine during the week,

00:24:12.070 --> 00:24:16.430
whether that's leaving a career
and starting your own startup--

00:24:16.430 --> 00:24:19.940
why do we find it so
hard to breakthrough?

00:24:19.940 --> 00:24:21.950
This is the reason.

00:24:21.950 --> 00:24:24.720
We are fundamentally
irrational creature.

00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.360
We are not Dr. Spocks.

00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:28.730
And there's definitely a
mean in the tech industry

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:30.910
that thinks we are,
because algorithms

00:24:30.910 --> 00:24:32.270
are fundamentally rational.

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:35.880
But people are not.

00:24:35.880 --> 00:24:39.080
All our thoughts and behaviors
a driven by our emotions.

00:24:42.460 --> 00:24:43.940
And here's the
rub, they're often

00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:46.040
the emotions of a
five-year-old that's

00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:49.930
still trying to survive and
protect itself from stuff--

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.950
disappointments, frustrations.

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:56.400
Have you ever
reacted to your lover

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.620
in a way you know you used
to do when you were a kid?

00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.909
Anyone's who's married, I
believe you need to realize,

00:25:02.909 --> 00:25:03.950
that's what you're doing.

00:25:07.102 --> 00:25:08.810
It's because you're
hanging onto emotions

00:25:08.810 --> 00:25:10.480
that are no longer
really serving you,

00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:13.980
but they're stuck
inside your biology.

00:25:13.980 --> 00:25:17.550
They're literally wired
in after 20 or 30 or 40

00:25:17.550 --> 00:25:19.990
years of reacting the same way.

00:25:19.990 --> 00:25:22.990
And that's what conflict
is-- two people acting

00:25:22.990 --> 00:25:27.060
like the emotions of a five- or
seven- or 12- or 15-year-old.

00:25:27.060 --> 00:25:30.330
Stephen Pinker, great
thinker-- "Emotions

00:25:30.330 --> 00:25:32.900
are mechanism that set
the brain's highest goals.

00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:36.110
They probably evolved because
they were hard to fake."

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:39.560
So you can't-- so if you're
like, hungry emotion--

00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:40.730
need to eat.

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:41.740
Great.

00:25:41.740 --> 00:25:43.190
You can't think through.

00:25:43.190 --> 00:25:44.000
You need to think that through.

00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:44.500
Eat.

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:46.260
Survive.

00:25:46.260 --> 00:25:48.270
Make babies.

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:53.380
Because our emotions drive us
to the three F's-- feed, forage,

00:25:53.380 --> 00:25:56.350
and fornicate.

00:25:56.350 --> 00:25:57.360
Right?

00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.610
And then we saw having habits.

00:25:58.610 --> 00:26:01.150
Well those berries
killed my uncle.

00:26:01.150 --> 00:26:03.081
Don't want to have
those berries.

00:26:03.081 --> 00:26:03.580
Brilliant.

00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:04.910
I've learn something brilliant.

00:26:04.910 --> 00:26:05.817
Wonderful.

00:26:05.817 --> 00:26:07.400
But then, presented
with a strawberry,

00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:12.410
I may never taste the juiciness
and delight of a strawberry.

00:26:12.410 --> 00:26:15.170
And then when we're scared, we
do one of these three things.

00:26:15.170 --> 00:26:18.210
We fight, we flight,
or we freeze, when

00:26:18.210 --> 00:26:19.905
it's really bad-- play dead.

00:26:19.905 --> 00:26:23.520
Hope whatever it is goes away.

00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:25.950
Who can recognize
themselves as predominantly,

00:26:25.950 --> 00:26:28.210
when they're reactive, when
they're angry a fighter?

00:26:28.210 --> 00:26:29.830
Put your hands up.

00:26:29.830 --> 00:26:31.470
You get angry.

00:26:31.470 --> 00:26:34.220
And who recognizes themselves
as a shutdown, don't talk to me,

00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:36.620
I'm out, close the
door, I'm not going

00:26:36.620 --> 00:26:40.010
to talk to you for five
days because you upset me?

00:26:40.010 --> 00:26:42.320
Call them innies and outies--
fighters and flighters--

00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.060
and everyone has
one or the other.

00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.530
But we all have access to
all of these things, all

00:26:47.530 --> 00:26:49.880
driven by emotions.

00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:52.650
So we are wired
to do both things,

00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:55.860
but we're conditioned to
not start creating things.

00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.740
We would rather be
efficient and predictable

00:26:58.740 --> 00:27:05.210
and hope we survive, than
take risk and possibly thrive.

00:27:05.210 --> 00:27:09.045
That is the nature of the
conditioned society we live.

00:27:09.045 --> 00:27:10.420
And when I mean
conditioned, mean

00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:13.940
neuro-conditioning,
repeated ways of behaving.

00:27:13.940 --> 00:27:16.560
When at school, you show
someone an amazing creative idea

00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.850
and they were like, pfft.

00:27:17.850 --> 00:27:21.180
And you were like, ah,
don't to try that again.

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:23.664
That hurt.

00:27:23.664 --> 00:27:24.640
Right?

00:27:24.640 --> 00:27:27.010
And that's the
basic rub of this.

00:27:27.010 --> 00:27:27.639
of this works.

00:27:27.639 --> 00:27:29.055
This switching on,
which I'm going

00:27:29.055 --> 00:27:31.730
to experience in a
minute, is a choice,

00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:35.517
to work out how to hack and
master this emotional system--

00:27:35.517 --> 00:27:37.350
not just in our biology,
but in our culture,

00:27:37.350 --> 00:27:40.080
organizational culture, which
is a kind of manifestation

00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:44.859
of our individual emotions,
and our social systems.

00:27:44.859 --> 00:27:46.525
That's the basic rub
of all breakthrough

00:27:46.525 --> 00:27:48.650
is we have learn how to
hack and master this.

00:27:48.650 --> 00:27:50.900
The good news is,
this is actually

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:53.890
from an article quoted
in "Scientific American"

00:27:53.890 --> 00:27:55.330
last month.

00:27:55.330 --> 00:27:57.870
"People who learn to adjust
and adapt their biology

00:27:57.870 --> 00:27:59.640
live longer, are
happier, wealthier,

00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.060
better at relationships,
more popular and trusted,

00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:05.260
and less likely to be
addicted or arrested."

00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:07.640
That's what comes from doing
the work of understanding

00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:08.665
your biology.

00:28:08.665 --> 00:28:12.700
It's an amazing system that
can be selfish and shut down,

00:28:12.700 --> 00:28:14.500
or it can be creative
and collaborative.

00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:15.390
Your choice.

00:28:15.390 --> 00:28:19.079
In every moment, your
choice-- no one else's.

00:28:19.079 --> 00:28:20.370
So how do we hack this biology?

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:23.320
Well giving you that
shortened summary diagram

00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:25.050
is probably not going to help.

00:28:25.050 --> 00:28:28.190
So here's one I
prepared earlier.

00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:34.300
I use this with CEOs
and street kids.

00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.300
Summary of everything
that goes on every moment

00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:37.970
of every human being's life.

00:28:37.970 --> 00:28:39.870
Hands-- behaviors, habit.

00:28:39.870 --> 00:28:41.660
Head-- beliefs, thinking.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:43.930
Being-- emotions, the heart.

00:28:43.930 --> 00:28:47.740
Every moment in your life,
you have a hands, head, heart

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:49.360
experience.

00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:51.900
And these max up
in organizations

00:28:51.900 --> 00:28:55.740
to processing systems, ideas,
models, plans, and culture,

00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:58.500
purpose, brand down here.

00:28:58.500 --> 00:29:01.340
Now, most CEOs know that
this is what guides the ship.

00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:07.630
Purpose is the top
three focus of CEOs,

00:29:07.630 --> 00:29:10.690
according to IBM's world survey.

00:29:10.690 --> 00:29:12.610
Big talk.

00:29:12.610 --> 00:29:16.040
So, reacting to life.

00:29:16.040 --> 00:29:17.370
It's kind of what's going on.

00:29:17.370 --> 00:29:21.210
Change triggers fear or,
if someone's in your face,

00:29:21.210 --> 00:29:25.340
triggers trauma, sense of lack,
disappointment, frustration.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.130
The stress response
cascades down

00:29:27.130 --> 00:29:28.472
with adrenaline and cortisol.

00:29:28.472 --> 00:29:30.680
Cortisol kills us, by the
way, if it's too much of it

00:29:30.680 --> 00:29:32.615
over time,
inflammation and stuff.

00:29:32.615 --> 00:29:34.940
You get tunnel
vision, tunnel memory.

00:29:34.940 --> 00:29:36.440
You can only remember
the time where

00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:38.780
you made a total fool of
yourself speaking in public.

00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:42.830
You can't remember the five
times you had a great response.

00:29:42.830 --> 00:29:45.250
And you can't think openly.

00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:46.227
Your mind is like this.

00:29:46.227 --> 00:29:47.810
Who's been in a
workshop where they've

00:29:47.810 --> 00:29:50.870
seen someone go into that
place, and they're in stress,

00:29:50.870 --> 00:29:52.905
they're in tunnel
vision, tunnel memory?

00:29:52.905 --> 00:29:54.280
There's no point,
there's nothing

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:57.080
you can do right now with them,
until you calm them down out

00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:58.350
of stress.

00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:00.520
You then react with
predictable habits,

00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.290
still in the basal ganglia,
ready for being really easy,

00:30:03.290 --> 00:30:06.080
efficient way of
dealing with the world.

00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.100
You can turn off new ideas,
you turn off you people.

00:30:09.100 --> 00:30:12.700
You then-- this is the kicker--
you then rationalize it

00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:16.880
with amazing justifications
that make you seem right.

00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:19.320
And we know there's nothing
that human beings like

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:25.214
more than being right--
usually-- switched off.

00:30:25.214 --> 00:30:26.880
And the senior, the
more senior you get,

00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:30.760
usually, the more
right you like to be.

00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:35.700
Plus, the total doozy is,
your neural plasticity

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.230
lessens as you get old.

00:30:38.230 --> 00:30:42.490
Who runs all
companies in the main?

00:30:42.490 --> 00:30:43.810
Old people.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:44.800
Not yours so much.

00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:49.702
Most of the companies are run by
people over 50 over 60 over 70.

00:30:49.702 --> 00:30:50.660
Have got a lot to lose.

00:30:50.660 --> 00:30:53.076
The experiences things called
stress-- this is by the way,

00:30:53.076 --> 00:30:55.180
we call stress.

00:30:55.180 --> 00:30:57.010
And the research is shocking.

00:30:57.010 --> 00:31:01.410
Stress is over
50% of millennials

00:31:01.410 --> 00:31:03.850
say they've been kept awake
at night in the last month

00:31:03.850 --> 00:31:05.500
by stress.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:08.660
Depression is now the number
one burden on global health.

00:31:08.660 --> 00:31:09.220
Number one.

00:31:09.220 --> 00:31:12.420
Bigger than obesity
and cancer, according

00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:14.110
to World Health Organization.

00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:18.190
And suicide kills more
men between 15 and 25

00:31:18.190 --> 00:31:20.540
in America than anything else.

00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:23.280
More than road
traffic accidents.

00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:26.200
Someone said to me recently,
a scientists, stress

00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.810
is the Black Plague
of the 21st century.

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.370
It's killing us all.

00:31:31.370 --> 00:31:34.092
It's important stuff.

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:34.800
So let's go live.

00:31:34.800 --> 00:31:36.409
I'm going to give
out a little tool.

00:31:36.409 --> 00:31:38.700
If you can pass them out,
Micheal, that would be great.

00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:40.890
So what we're going to do
is, remember that problem you

00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:41.670
wanted to breakthrough?

00:31:41.670 --> 00:31:43.670
If you can just put some
at the end of each row,

00:31:43.670 --> 00:31:44.910
people can pass it down.

00:31:44.910 --> 00:31:48.230
On the left-hand
side of your card,

00:31:48.230 --> 00:31:51.820
I want you to write
down how you behave

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:55.280
around this problem--
your hands, how

00:31:55.280 --> 00:31:58.250
you think about this
problem, and how

00:31:58.250 --> 00:32:00.110
you feel about this problem.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:01.850
OK?

00:32:01.850 --> 00:32:03.640
So just a minute on this.

00:32:03.640 --> 00:32:06.050
So on the left-hand
side of your card,

00:32:06.050 --> 00:32:10.390
on the side that's got the
mixing desk-- I'm a DJ,

00:32:10.390 --> 00:32:15.202
so I like musical metaphors.

00:32:15.202 --> 00:32:16.410
Right, on the left-hand side.

00:32:16.410 --> 00:32:17.400
Have you got pens?

00:32:17.400 --> 00:32:19.320
Here's a few here.

00:32:19.320 --> 00:32:22.700
Write down where your
behaviors are-- just

00:32:22.700 --> 00:32:26.360
one behavior-- how you
think about the problem,

00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.320
and how you feel about
the problem-- usually.

00:32:30.320 --> 00:32:30.829
Here we go.

00:32:30.829 --> 00:32:31.370
You're great.

00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.280
Here's a whole smorgasbord.

00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:37.780
Look at the resources here
we've got in our hands.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:38.280
OK.

00:32:40.810 --> 00:32:45.530
How you feel about the
problem-- irritated,

00:32:45.530 --> 00:32:46.920
frustrated, scared, whatever.

00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:48.045
No one's going to see this.

00:32:48.045 --> 00:32:49.380
This is yours.

00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:49.880
OK?

00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:52.130
So that hold back.

00:32:52.130 --> 00:32:55.820
You're only kidding
yourself of the experience.

00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.161
How you think about the problem,
and what you dear usually

00:33:00.161 --> 00:33:00.910
with this problem.

00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.540
Pen?

00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:11.760
Yeah, use a big one there.

00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.259
Great.

00:33:15.280 --> 00:33:18.000
Try and be as
accurate as you can.

00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.410
The more awareness you have
over your biological patterns

00:33:23.410 --> 00:33:25.690
and habits, the more you
can break through them.

00:33:25.690 --> 00:33:27.398
It's very hard to
break through something

00:33:27.398 --> 00:33:31.410
you can't see or are not aware
of, slash, probably impossible.

00:33:38.680 --> 00:33:40.149
And then at the
bottom of the card,

00:33:40.149 --> 00:33:41.815
you'll see a little
box called triggers.

00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:48.140
Write down what's the
trigger that triggers you

00:33:48.140 --> 00:33:50.430
into this way of being.

00:33:50.430 --> 00:33:53.830
Someone not listening to you,
an email coming in at 10:00 at

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.266
night pissing you off,
someone saying you've

00:33:56.266 --> 00:33:57.890
got to go and do a
talk at a conference

00:33:57.890 --> 00:33:59.180
that you don't
really want to go to.

00:33:59.180 --> 00:33:59.720
Whatever.

00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:01.180
What's the trigger?

00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:02.537
What is the trigger?

00:34:02.537 --> 00:34:03.953
And there's probably
many, but see

00:34:03.953 --> 00:34:07.150
if you can identify one which
gets you into this place.

00:34:24.659 --> 00:34:27.650
There's no right or
wrong here, by the way.

00:34:27.650 --> 00:34:29.560
It's just what you
notice about yourself.

00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:35.370
So keep musing on that.

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:46.980
Try and get one for each
dial, let's call them a dial.

00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:07.660
All right.

00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.126
So here's the choice
you have right now.

00:35:11.126 --> 00:35:12.500
Obviously there's
a different way

00:35:12.500 --> 00:35:16.310
about being in this
situation, and the choice

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:20.770
you have is to be right,
or to be creative.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:23.660
But you can't be both.

00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:25.440
You can be right, if
that's the right way

00:35:25.440 --> 00:35:27.864
to be, given the
situation you're in.

00:35:27.864 --> 00:35:29.530
That's the right
business model to have,

00:35:29.530 --> 00:35:32.370
that's the right
project to be running.

00:35:32.370 --> 00:35:36.470
Or, you can entertain
the thought--

00:35:36.470 --> 00:35:40.470
which might scare you-- for
how you have it right now isn't

00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:44.300
the most appropriate
way, the most fitted way

00:35:44.300 --> 00:35:48.720
to be given the nature
of the world around you.

00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:53.430
So that's-- an example would
be, you're in your late 20s,

00:35:53.430 --> 00:35:56.360
and you realize you keep having
six month relationships that go

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.770
really intense and then
it kind of fizzled out.

00:35:59.770 --> 00:36:03.966
Yours could be two years long--
whatever it is for you, right?

00:36:03.966 --> 00:36:06.090
And you're like, ah, I kind
of have a pattern here.

00:36:06.090 --> 00:36:08.054
And then you have
a choice-- do I

00:36:08.054 --> 00:36:09.790
want to keep on
having these, which

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.780
seem to be fine in my 20s,
but then you get to your 30s,

00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.369
and heaven forbid, like
me, in your early 40s,

00:36:15.369 --> 00:36:17.410
and you realize that all
your friends are happily

00:36:17.410 --> 00:36:18.868
married-- or some
of them, anyway--

00:36:18.868 --> 00:36:20.594
and you don't want
dating anymore.

00:36:20.594 --> 00:36:22.510
You don't want to be
having those big, intense

00:36:22.510 --> 00:36:23.520
relationships.

00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:25.490
But you're still
using the patterns

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:28.820
that you have been
using for 15 years.

00:36:28.820 --> 00:36:30.790
And then you have a choice.

00:36:30.790 --> 00:36:32.360
Do I want to be
right about this,

00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:35.140
that all men are
untrustworthy, all will women

00:36:35.140 --> 00:36:38.622
are nuts, usually are
the two that come out.

00:36:38.622 --> 00:36:40.080
Or do I want to
break through this,

00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:41.496
because I actually
want something.

00:36:41.496 --> 00:36:43.860
I want to be higher
up that J-curve.

00:36:43.860 --> 00:36:49.410
Here's one of the best named
professors in business, Sydney

00:36:49.410 --> 00:36:52.830
Finkelstein, who did a
research project that

00:36:52.830 --> 00:36:55.035
came out in a book, "Why
Smart Executives Fail."

00:36:55.035 --> 00:36:56.660
Remember we talked
about the smart guys

00:36:56.660 --> 00:36:58.620
at Kodak, the smart
people at Hilton.

00:36:58.620 --> 00:37:00.290
They're not stupid.

00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:03.170
Failures are caused by--
he did research with,

00:37:03.170 --> 00:37:05.650
I think over 50 companies,
maybe more-- failures

00:37:05.650 --> 00:37:08.710
are caused by flawed executive
mindsets that throw off

00:37:08.710 --> 00:37:12.320
a company's
perception of reality,

00:37:12.320 --> 00:37:15.260
and delusional attitudes that
keep this inaccurate reality

00:37:15.260 --> 00:37:17.620
in place.

00:37:17.620 --> 00:37:19.280
We can summarize
that by being right.

00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.150
I did a talk, a
workshop, recently,

00:37:24.150 --> 00:37:27.680
with a very large company
in Silicon Valley.

00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.340
And we went through all the chat
about breakthrough innovation,

00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.798
it's not going to
be easy, it's not

00:37:31.798 --> 00:37:33.370
going to be pretty
a lot of the time.

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:35.250
But we're going to get
out some big stuff.

00:37:35.250 --> 00:37:38.410
And the most senior guy who ran
the business unit-- top five

00:37:38.410 --> 00:37:41.010
in the company-- came
into the workshop

00:37:41.010 --> 00:37:44.431
and was right about everything.

00:37:44.431 --> 00:37:44.930
All that.

00:37:44.930 --> 00:37:47.420
You could see the lights
on in the senior execs--

00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:49.070
it was SVPs I was working with.

00:37:49.070 --> 00:37:50.510
The lights on--
here we are, I've

00:37:50.510 --> 00:37:52.176
been thinking about
this for five years,

00:37:52.176 --> 00:37:55.000
and now getting finally
to transform something.

00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:57.420
We had like 15
potentially massive ideas

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.870
coming out, very early stage.

00:37:59.870 --> 00:38:00.920
The light just went out.

00:38:00.920 --> 00:38:04.810
And like, ah, I can't bring
this creativity to this place.

00:38:04.810 --> 00:38:08.120
I can't bring my full self,
my full passion to this place.

00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:09.960
Heartbreaking for me to see.

00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:14.610
So while assumption is
the mother all mistakes,

00:38:14.610 --> 00:38:16.381
insight is the mother
of all magnificence.

00:38:16.381 --> 00:38:18.506
And as people who work in
marketing, you know that.

00:38:18.506 --> 00:38:22.060
Without insight, you haven't got
a product that's going to work

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.082
or a campaign that's
going to work.

00:38:24.082 --> 00:38:28.900
And often people masquerade
flawed thinking as insight.

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.150
But we all have assumptions.

00:38:30.150 --> 00:38:33.660
This is my son
cooking in a soup.

00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:35.166
We were chopping all the veg.

00:38:35.166 --> 00:38:37.540
And I turned around to go to
the fridge to get something,

00:38:37.540 --> 00:38:39.660
and I came back and he'd
put all the peelings

00:38:39.660 --> 00:38:41.450
of the veg in the soup.

00:38:41.450 --> 00:38:45.060
And what do you think I said?

00:38:45.060 --> 00:38:47.110
No!

00:38:47.110 --> 00:38:48.992
That's not how you make soup.

00:38:48.992 --> 00:38:50.700
And being someone who
teaches this stuff,

00:38:50.700 --> 00:38:52.074
I was like, hold
on a minute, I'm

00:38:52.074 --> 00:38:56.090
doing the "that's not how we do
things around here" sentence.

00:38:56.090 --> 00:38:58.140
And lo and behold, that
evening, I found a recipe

00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:00.345
for vegetable peel soup.

00:39:00.345 --> 00:39:01.720
But think how many
times you shut

00:39:01.720 --> 00:39:04.720
yourself down and
other people down,

00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:07.160
because you know the right
way to do things around here.

00:39:09.870 --> 00:39:12.530
The right way to do a brief,
the right way to do marketing,

00:39:12.530 --> 00:39:17.979
the right way to
create an algorithm.

00:39:17.979 --> 00:39:19.270
Management's about being right.

00:39:19.270 --> 00:39:21.915
Management was born,
mainly in the '30s, '20s,

00:39:21.915 --> 00:39:25.220
'30s, professional management.

00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:29.520
Alfred Sloan, CEO of GM,
Sloan School of Management,

00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:32.310
you may have heard of,
who basically realized

00:39:32.310 --> 00:39:33.860
that to create
efficiency, we need

00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.440
people to do the same
thing, the right thing,

00:39:35.440 --> 00:39:36.648
over and over and over again.

00:39:36.648 --> 00:39:38.780
I don't want you to be
creative, you workers.

00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:43.402
Just stamp the metal in this
way, exactly in this way,

00:39:43.402 --> 00:39:44.360
and we'll be efficient.

00:39:46.982 --> 00:39:48.690
But we live in an age
of constant change,

00:39:48.690 --> 00:39:50.850
when no one has the
right also very long.

00:39:50.850 --> 00:39:53.840
No one-- not even Google's
algorithm has the right answer

00:39:53.840 --> 00:39:57.510
forever, I predict.

00:39:57.510 --> 00:39:59.670
So the question is, can
you break through yourself

00:39:59.670 --> 00:40:04.220
at your most successful moments,
like I did with my business,

00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:05.900
when I left my own
business at the peak.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:07.600
We'd just done six
or seven years.

00:40:07.600 --> 00:40:10.140
I was just getting people
to call us, rather than us

00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:11.890
calling them, which
in a consultant's life

00:40:11.890 --> 00:40:13.574
is like the holy grail.

00:40:13.574 --> 00:40:14.490
Like, we're in demand.

00:40:14.490 --> 00:40:16.740
We don't have to go and
do new business anymore.

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:18.600
How awesome is that?

00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.780
And I left, because I
knew it wasn't right.

00:40:21.780 --> 00:40:24.890
So let's go live again.

00:40:24.890 --> 00:40:29.190
And we're going to switch
it on and shift, you

00:40:29.190 --> 00:40:31.727
from the left-hand side
to the right-hand side.

00:40:31.727 --> 00:40:33.102
And the way to do
this is, is you

00:40:33.102 --> 00:40:35.390
know about emotions
driving the whole ship.

00:40:35.390 --> 00:40:38.754
We can't start with behaviors,
we have to start with emotions.

00:40:38.754 --> 00:40:40.420
You say to yourself
over and over again,

00:40:40.420 --> 00:40:42.770
I'm going to not eat
the cookies anymore.

00:40:42.770 --> 00:40:47.324
And that night, the ice
scream comes out the freezer.

00:40:47.324 --> 00:40:48.740
Or, I'm not going
to drink anymore

00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:52.210
and then you're at festival--
oh gone on, then, have a pint.

00:40:52.210 --> 00:40:54.310
Familiar feeling, anyone?

00:40:54.310 --> 00:40:56.480
You have to get down
to the emotional level.

00:40:56.480 --> 00:40:58.270
So we're going to
reconnect the heart,

00:40:58.270 --> 00:41:00.410
then you can start with
rewiring the brain,

00:41:00.410 --> 00:41:03.270
and then you can get busy in
the world re-mixing the world.

00:41:03.270 --> 00:41:06.120
So if you entertain
this notion--

00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:08.730
we're getting a little
mindfulness exercise.

00:41:08.730 --> 00:41:12.040
Put everything down,
including cards.

00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.290
You don't need them right now.

00:41:13.290 --> 00:41:15.498
You can write down what you
come up with in a minute.

00:41:15.498 --> 00:41:18.700
It's kind of visualization,
rather than a pure meditation.

00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.460
Let's try and get some
ideas out for you.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.430
So assume a position of
some kind of dignity,

00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.420
whatever that means to you.

00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:28.100
No judgment.

00:41:33.400 --> 00:41:38.180
And just take a couple of
breaths, just to be here now.

00:41:42.381 --> 00:41:43.630
Notice the sounds in the room.

00:41:47.350 --> 00:41:50.630
Let them come to you.

00:41:50.630 --> 00:41:53.880
Notice any physical
feelings in your body.

00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:57.090
And then bring this problem
that you want to break through,

00:41:57.090 --> 00:41:59.680
the juicer, it can be a
new one, not even the one

00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:01.170
you've been working on.

00:42:01.170 --> 00:42:02.926
Like if you broke
through this, your life

00:42:02.926 --> 00:42:04.417
would never be the same again.

00:42:04.417 --> 00:42:06.250
Bring that problem into
your mind right now.

00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:13.470
Just notice what you want
to do with it with hands,

00:42:13.470 --> 00:42:15.020
this meaty, juicy problem.

00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:21.278
And then what you say about it.

00:42:21.278 --> 00:42:25.530
And there's usually, those
sayings, usually come down to,

00:42:25.530 --> 00:42:27.462
you're wrong, or
the world's wrong.

00:42:27.462 --> 00:42:29.170
I'm wrong, something
about me, or there's

00:42:29.170 --> 00:42:30.461
something wrong with the world.

00:42:33.030 --> 00:42:35.520
And then, feel the
emotional stuff.

00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:37.900
Feel where you're gut's at,
feel where your lungs are at,

00:42:37.900 --> 00:42:40.860
feel your heart rate.

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:43.190
Feel whether you want
to breathe big, open,

00:42:43.190 --> 00:42:45.320
or kind of short and tense.

00:42:49.450 --> 00:42:53.830
So as you have probably
in your biology right now,

00:42:53.830 --> 00:42:56.320
conscious and
aware of it, I want

00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:00.750
you to imagine all the
human beings right now

00:43:00.750 --> 00:43:03.580
in the world who are dealing
with gnarly problems, problems

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:09.486
many of them probably more grave
or challenging than our own.

00:43:09.486 --> 00:43:14.940
And think about how many
people coming into the world--

00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.530
whether they've been abused
or refugees or all the people,

00:43:19.530 --> 00:43:22.030
suicidal at some
point, but they've

00:43:22.030 --> 00:43:25.650
managed to find a
way to come back

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:30.790
with creativity and
compassion, with leadership.

00:43:30.790 --> 00:43:34.800
Imagine how many millions of
people there are, like us.

00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:37.310
And imagine how
many millions have

00:43:37.310 --> 00:43:42.150
been able to do this since
the beginning of time--

00:43:42.150 --> 00:43:48.080
to bring something more
back, to expand their heart,

00:43:48.080 --> 00:43:50.530
and to bring more love
and passion and compassion

00:43:50.530 --> 00:43:55.390
and caring with their children,
other people's children.

00:43:55.390 --> 00:44:01.330
We all have access to that
power, to make a difference.

00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:09.020
Just feel them now in
you, and you in them.

00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:12.870
And now notice how your heart
feels about your challenge.

00:44:19.175 --> 00:44:24.190
And now what you say
about it, and the ideas

00:44:24.190 --> 00:44:26.530
that come to mind, why
it might be happening,

00:44:26.530 --> 00:44:30.300
what you can do-- any insight
how to breakthrough it.

00:44:30.300 --> 00:44:32.520
If I was like this.

00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:37.340
If I shifted my thinking
a little bit to here.

00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:39.810
If I got into the world
of the other people

00:44:39.810 --> 00:44:42.610
who I'm dealing with, maybe
they're thinking this.

00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.030
And then notice what your hands
want to do with this problem,

00:44:51.030 --> 00:44:58.748
this challenge, which is
an added [INAUDIBLE] bonus

00:44:58.748 --> 00:45:03.290
to anchor this feeling
somehow into your being.

00:45:03.290 --> 00:45:05.800
So a common way is to
hold your fist tight.

00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:12.510
Or stand a certain way, sit a
certain way, think of a color

00:45:12.510 --> 00:45:13.820
or place.

00:45:13.820 --> 00:45:18.600
Just a positive anchor that you
can go back to and bring back

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:24.287
this feeling of openness,
fluidity, flexibility,

00:45:24.287 --> 00:45:24.870
collaboration.

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.110
When you're ready, just open
your eyes, coming back here now

00:45:32.110 --> 00:45:34.300
in this room, in this moment.

00:45:38.722 --> 00:45:40.180
Before I move on,
would anyone like

00:45:40.180 --> 00:45:43.390
to share how their hands
felt before and after?

00:45:43.390 --> 00:45:47.520
It's usually the most clear way.

00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:48.630
Anyone?

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.057
No need to.

00:45:51.057 --> 00:45:52.515
Anyone feel they
were sort of going

00:45:52.515 --> 00:45:55.580
to push the problem away and
then realize actually, they

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:59.860
could work with it and more
open, more open-handed.

00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.100
Any insights come out?

00:46:03.752 --> 00:46:05.540
You're going to
Keep it to yourself.

00:46:05.540 --> 00:46:06.400
Go on, then.

00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:09.120
We're not in America now, Nick.

00:46:09.120 --> 00:46:11.053
Americans are like,
I want to share it.

00:46:13.720 --> 00:46:16.214
So, what we basically
coming to, and I'm

00:46:16.214 --> 00:46:19.220
going to close up in a second
so you can ask some questions.

00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:21.270
The dharma, if you
like, the teaching,

00:46:21.270 --> 00:46:24.935
the truth of
breakthrough, is you've

00:46:24.935 --> 00:46:28.789
got to release the old
before you get the new.

00:46:28.789 --> 00:46:30.080
Release the old business model.

00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:32.540
Entertain the idea that
your algorithm will not

00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.480
be there forever.

00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:36.770
Or that your project,
or that your way

00:46:36.770 --> 00:46:40.010
of being in relationships,
or with your health,

00:46:40.010 --> 00:46:41.175
or whatever it is.

00:46:41.175 --> 00:46:43.555
You've got to release it
before you can receive it.

00:46:43.555 --> 00:46:46.250
There's no room otherwise.

00:46:46.250 --> 00:46:50.410
If you go to Ikea and you buy
a whole new kitchen suite,

00:46:50.410 --> 00:46:53.265
and you come back to
your flat and there's

00:46:53.265 --> 00:46:55.624
the old kitchen there,
what are you going to do?

00:46:55.624 --> 00:46:57.414
Like, oh!

00:46:57.414 --> 00:46:59.559
Can't get it in.

00:46:59.559 --> 00:47:01.600
So you've got to be able
to exist without kitchen

00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:02.360
for a couple of days.

00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:03.401
It's really inconvenient.

00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:08.340
You've got to excavate
the assumptions

00:47:08.340 --> 00:47:10.400
that your business
or your project

00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.785
is holding before
you can innovate.

00:47:12.785 --> 00:47:15.160
And the more you're willing
to let go of the assumptions,

00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.730
the assumption is, everyone
wants to have printed photos.

00:47:20.730 --> 00:47:24.350
People value printed photos.

00:47:24.350 --> 00:47:26.949
Let go of that to see
what they actually do.

00:47:26.949 --> 00:47:28.740
And you've got to break
it down in some way

00:47:28.740 --> 00:47:29.781
before you break through.

00:47:29.781 --> 00:47:31.420
Because the bottom
line is, everything

00:47:31.420 --> 00:47:33.430
will have to go into
break down before you

00:47:33.430 --> 00:47:34.537
can have a breakthrough.

00:47:34.537 --> 00:47:36.370
The question is whether
that breakdown feels

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:40.390
like a disaster-- burnout,
depression, blah, blah, blah,

00:47:40.390 --> 00:47:44.680
or whether you guide it as you
lead yourself to breakthrough.

00:47:44.680 --> 00:47:46.150
And it can be
elegant and graceful

00:47:46.150 --> 00:47:50.010
and take a day
rather than 10 years.

00:47:50.010 --> 00:47:51.490
I know this the hard way.

00:47:51.490 --> 00:47:53.460
I spent six years
in psychotherapy,

00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:55.066
couldn't break
through my challenges.

00:47:55.066 --> 00:47:56.940
And that's why I went
on the 10 year journey.

00:47:56.940 --> 00:48:00.100
This book took me 10 years
to write, by the way.

00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.610
Because I wanted to know that
the science and the wisdom

00:48:03.610 --> 00:48:07.230
could integrate and that
I was on the right path.

00:48:09.860 --> 00:48:13.540
Most famous and successful
film of all time-- series--

00:48:13.540 --> 00:48:16.810
and what's the basic
teaching "Lord of the Rings"?

00:48:16.810 --> 00:48:18.410
Is it to go and get a fortune?

00:48:20.940 --> 00:48:22.970
What is the whole thing about?

00:48:22.970 --> 00:48:26.320
Collaboration to
get rid of the ring.

00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:28.850
We don't want the ring--
the ring of power,

00:48:28.850 --> 00:48:32.120
the ring of rightness,
the ring of control.

00:48:32.120 --> 00:48:34.717
Because the world will only work
when we get rid of the ring.

00:48:34.717 --> 00:48:36.300
Because as soon as
you have the power,

00:48:36.300 --> 00:48:37.716
you start becoming
a bit like him.

00:48:42.230 --> 00:48:44.775
So the bottom line
is, the more you

00:48:44.775 --> 00:48:47.070
can anticipate a
mismatch between yourself

00:48:47.070 --> 00:48:49.460
and the environment--
feeling stressed,

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.325
drinking more than you used to,
relationships are not working,

00:48:53.325 --> 00:48:56.720
can't connect with
the kids, whatever--

00:48:56.720 --> 00:48:59.390
the more you can notice
that there's a mismatch,

00:48:59.390 --> 00:49:03.090
something's not fitting, the
more you could break through.

00:49:03.090 --> 00:49:06.460
Consciously look at releasing
your own beliefs and habits

00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.865
before you break down and
proactively ride this curve.

00:49:09.865 --> 00:49:12.240
Because you're all on a curve
in every hour of your life.

00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:15.340
Most people just
don't know it yet.

00:49:15.340 --> 00:49:16.470
So talk about hacks.

00:49:16.470 --> 00:49:18.062
This is about
hacking your biology.

00:49:18.062 --> 00:49:19.520
You've got the
capacity to do this.

00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.445
Every human being has.

00:49:20.445 --> 00:49:22.180
There's nothing
you need more than

00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:23.600
what you've got inside you.

00:49:23.600 --> 00:49:24.690
But I want no shortcuts.

00:49:24.690 --> 00:49:26.520
This is not the-- I'm not the
kind of guy who sells you,

00:49:26.520 --> 00:49:29.220
come to me and there's a five
minute fix and everything's

00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.800
going to be brilliant.

00:49:30.800 --> 00:49:32.530
The breakthroughs
can happen quickly,

00:49:32.530 --> 00:49:35.930
but sustaining the breakthroughs
when everyone around you

00:49:35.930 --> 00:49:37.830
is like going, no,
but you love drinking.

00:49:37.830 --> 00:49:39.230
Oh, but you're the
person who's the-- you're

00:49:39.230 --> 00:49:40.590
the big director of all of us.

00:49:40.590 --> 00:49:41.090
Come on.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:42.770
Let's go out.

00:49:42.770 --> 00:49:44.970
Or you come back from a
conference and you're like,

00:49:44.970 --> 00:49:46.386
we've got to do a
project in this.

00:49:46.386 --> 00:49:48.840
And everyone's like that
is rubbish, ridiculous.

00:49:48.840 --> 00:49:50.490
Never going to happen.

00:49:50.490 --> 00:49:52.774
That's where the work is.

00:49:52.774 --> 00:49:54.690
Because to embody and
embed your breakthroughs

00:49:54.690 --> 00:49:56.140
is really the rewiring.

00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:59.380
And it could take months,
if not years-- honestly--

00:49:59.380 --> 00:50:00.950
to really rewire yourself.

00:50:00.950 --> 00:50:04.834
But it can happen in
any area of your life.

00:50:04.834 --> 00:50:06.875
So on the back of your
card, there are few things

00:50:06.875 --> 00:50:08.460
that I've developed
to make this--

00:50:08.460 --> 00:50:10.850
I don't do coaching
anymore one-on-one, or very

00:50:10.850 --> 00:50:14.430
rarely and usually only
with social entrepreneurs.

00:50:14.430 --> 00:50:17.690
I've spent seven years
developing a DIY coaching kit.

00:50:17.690 --> 00:50:18.780
It's peer-to-peer.

00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:20.830
It's like the
Airbnb of coaching.

00:50:20.830 --> 00:50:22.550
You coach your friend
or a colleague,

00:50:22.550 --> 00:50:26.680
10 sessions of coaching,
for like 100th of the price.

00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.900
21 day video challenge, just
launching that at the moment.

00:50:29.900 --> 00:50:32.340
21 of those sort of
little exercises,

00:50:32.340 --> 00:50:33.924
visualizations,
seven minutes a day.

00:50:33.924 --> 00:50:36.340
And if any of you are interested
in building a new project

00:50:36.340 --> 00:50:40.380
or enterprise, we are about to
start a 12 month program using

00:50:40.380 --> 00:50:42.380
all those integration
tools I use with companies

00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:44.640
to individuals to
develop projects

00:50:44.640 --> 00:50:48.950
or careers around their purpose,
and what a purposes is for you.

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:52.460
And of course, I do teamwork,
and organizational stuff,

00:50:52.460 --> 00:50:54.070
if anyone's interested in that.

00:50:54.070 --> 00:50:58.480
So summary quote, it's
in the start of my book.

00:50:58.480 --> 00:51:01.510
A thinker called
Charles Dubois who

00:51:01.510 --> 00:51:03.510
wrote, "The important
thing is this,

00:51:03.510 --> 00:51:06.620
to be ready in every
moment to sacrifice who we

00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:09.516
are for who we could become."

00:51:09.516 --> 00:51:12.920
And I will add, no matter
how freaking scary it is.

00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:17.150
So that's me.

00:51:17.150 --> 00:51:20.220
A little bit of a
sample of my wares.

00:51:20.220 --> 00:51:23.930
Please do reach out to me over
the months and years, whatever.

00:51:23.930 --> 00:51:24.871
Stay involved.

00:51:24.871 --> 00:51:26.370
Michael, do you
want to hand around?

00:51:26.370 --> 00:51:27.850
There's a sign up
sheet if you want

00:51:27.850 --> 00:51:35.280
to get on my very secure and
confidential privacy blah,

00:51:35.280 --> 00:51:36.305
blah, blah, email list.

00:51:36.305 --> 00:51:38.180
I think we've time for
a couple of questions.

00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.090
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we
have time for questions,

00:51:39.090 --> 00:51:40.890
if anybody has any.

00:51:40.890 --> 00:51:43.030
NICK JANKEL: I like
provocative challenges most.

00:51:43.030 --> 00:51:44.988
But if you've got a
question, that's also good.

00:51:47.510 --> 00:51:48.308
Yeah.

00:51:48.308 --> 00:51:51.640
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] your
thoughts on picking up habits.

00:51:51.640 --> 00:51:53.600
So we've good habit
of daily life.

00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.470
They give us the basic idea
of [INAUDIBLE] who you are.

00:51:57.470 --> 00:51:59.970
And this creativity bit where
you are reassessing everything

00:51:59.970 --> 00:52:01.434
[INAUDIBLE] from scratch.

00:52:01.434 --> 00:52:02.225
NICK JANKEL: Right.

00:52:02.225 --> 00:52:03.087
AUDIENCE: And how that balances
in with your will power.

00:52:03.087 --> 00:52:03.878
NICK JANKEL: Right.

00:52:03.878 --> 00:52:05.886
AUDIENCE: So if
you have a habit,

00:52:05.886 --> 00:52:08.330
you're not using will
power. [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:08.330 --> 00:52:10.120
NICK JANKEL: Great question.

00:52:10.120 --> 00:52:13.284
So, that's one of the great
challenges of life, right?

00:52:13.284 --> 00:52:15.450
Is the J-curve is going
down is only one bit, right?

00:52:15.450 --> 00:52:18.300
Then you're going to come up and
build new habits and use habits

00:52:18.300 --> 00:52:18.930
well.

00:52:18.930 --> 00:52:21.240
If you were thinking
consciously about everything

00:52:21.240 --> 00:52:22.246
you did, you'd be exhausted
and you wouldn't be

00:52:22.246 --> 00:52:23.537
able to function and you'd die.

00:52:23.537 --> 00:52:26.730
And that's why we
are the way we are.

00:52:26.730 --> 00:52:29.600
So what I talk about in my
book a lot, and in my work,

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.572
in general is creative tension.

00:52:31.572 --> 00:52:33.780
And in fact, this is something
I was going to put up.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:38.030
This is the stoics,
the Greek philosophers,

00:52:38.030 --> 00:52:39.110
talked about sage.

00:52:39.110 --> 00:52:40.750
That was their highest ideal.

00:52:40.750 --> 00:52:44.700
Or the Taoist call it, the
Zhenren, the perfect man.

00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:46.590
And what they have
in common is, they

00:52:46.590 --> 00:52:49.730
are the people who manage
to integrate these two

00:52:49.730 --> 00:52:51.350
different elements.

00:52:51.350 --> 00:52:54.720
The-- what you might call
the active, getting-shit-done

00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:58.080
person with more
relaxed, mindful,

00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:01.870
I reflect and deliberate
and let go person.

00:53:01.870 --> 00:53:03.959
And so my work is really
about-- the thing is,

00:53:03.959 --> 00:53:05.500
we're usually better
about doing one.

00:53:05.500 --> 00:53:07.350
Most people in
this industry world

00:53:07.350 --> 00:53:09.475
and whatever getting-shit-done
stuff because that's

00:53:09.475 --> 00:53:12.190
what's gets the moola, right?

00:53:12.190 --> 00:53:15.370
So I focus move my work
on help building people

00:53:15.370 --> 00:53:17.310
to be able to let go
and to be mindful.

00:53:17.310 --> 00:53:19.060
Actually, more heartful
more than mindful,

00:53:19.060 --> 00:53:20.476
because you've got
into the heart,

00:53:20.476 --> 00:53:23.040
otherwise it's just all up here.

00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:29.064
So it's about learning how to
be able to go back and forth.

00:53:29.064 --> 00:53:30.230
Anyone heard of [INAUDIBLE]?

00:53:30.230 --> 00:53:32.950
A great, one of the earliest
Greek philosophers ever.

00:53:32.950 --> 00:53:34.490
He always got some fragments.

00:53:34.490 --> 00:53:37.500
And one of his
biggest thoughts is,

00:53:37.500 --> 00:53:39.900
that people think
these opposites,

00:53:39.900 --> 00:53:43.320
but actually, the string pulled
across like a guitar string,

00:53:43.320 --> 00:53:46.590
or he calls a lyre, because
that's what they had.

00:53:46.590 --> 00:53:48.970
And that's our life, is
this creative tension

00:53:48.970 --> 00:53:52.560
between we want to do stuff--
I'm an entrepreneur, right?

00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:55.210
I exist, I survive
because I get stuff

00:53:55.210 --> 00:53:58.030
done-- more than other people
quicker, hopefully smart,

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:00.000
hopefully better,
but not always.

00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:02.470
But my two kids are relying
on me getting stuff done,

00:54:02.470 --> 00:54:04.540
not just sitting there
in a monastery going,

00:54:04.540 --> 00:54:06.375
om, isn't life beautiful, right?

00:54:06.375 --> 00:54:09.040
But at the same time, if
I'm only getting shit done,

00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:11.380
I'm not reflecting, I'm
not discerning my purpose,

00:54:11.380 --> 00:54:14.200
I'm not noticing where I'm
no longer happy doing things,

00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.890
or things aren't right for me.

00:54:15.890 --> 00:54:17.640
And that's when I start
enter into stress.

00:54:17.640 --> 00:54:20.280
I wouldn't know it probably for
six months, a year, two years.

00:54:20.280 --> 00:54:23.340
I'll be like, wow, I'm drinking
wine every night again.

00:54:23.340 --> 00:54:24.200
Hmm.

00:54:24.200 --> 00:54:26.980
Something's probably
there, right?

00:54:26.980 --> 00:54:28.292
So that's the work, right?

00:54:28.292 --> 00:54:30.500
The work of this work is
being able to be able to go,

00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:31.083
you know what?

00:54:31.083 --> 00:54:32.760
This is now a
creative brainstorm,

00:54:32.760 --> 00:54:34.850
breakthrough workshop.

00:54:34.850 --> 00:54:37.790
Permission for two days
to think any thought.

00:54:37.790 --> 00:54:39.824
No thought is right,
no thought is wrong.

00:54:39.824 --> 00:54:41.740
We're going to get through
all our assumptions

00:54:41.740 --> 00:54:45.400
and actually get to the very
basic bottom of this industry.

00:54:45.400 --> 00:54:48.850
But in this workshop, it's
a get stuff done workshop.

00:54:48.850 --> 00:54:52.320
Now you can still
question and hold up

00:54:52.320 --> 00:54:54.394
some thoughts and
whatever about it,

00:54:54.394 --> 00:54:56.310
but we're not really
here to question anymore.

00:54:56.310 --> 00:54:58.464
We'll come back to that again.

00:54:58.464 --> 00:54:59.880
And be able to do
that in yourself

00:54:59.880 --> 00:55:03.030
in moments-- in and out,
in and out, in and out--

00:55:03.030 --> 00:55:06.630
is where the great is--
Eudaimonia, thriving.

00:55:06.630 --> 00:55:09.860
Being able to flip between
active and passive.

00:55:09.860 --> 00:55:12.740
Habits, building the
habits, and then being

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.050
spontaneous able to
go, you know what,

00:55:15.050 --> 00:55:17.090
let's not go on this
holiday today, let's

00:55:17.090 --> 00:55:18.600
go camping instead.

00:55:18.600 --> 00:55:20.400
And your kids are like, yeah!

00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.500
Because you felt it.

00:55:22.500 --> 00:55:24.540
Has anyone seen
the film, "Selma"?

00:55:24.540 --> 00:55:26.984
"Selma," about
Martin Luther King?

00:55:26.984 --> 00:55:28.900
So the whole thing was
about the confrontation

00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:34.250
between the Southern police and
whatever, and then the people

00:55:34.250 --> 00:55:36.200
who were the civil
rights movement.

00:55:36.200 --> 00:55:38.290
It's where the whole
thing changed in America.

00:55:38.290 --> 00:55:42.380
And so Martin Luther King has
been walking on this bridge.

00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.740
They'd been shot at and
beaten up and whatever.

00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:48.520
And he puts a call out to
other people around the country

00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:49.020
to come.

00:55:49.020 --> 00:55:51.110
So they all come to Selma.

00:55:51.110 --> 00:55:53.710
A few weeks after this,
Lyndon Baines, LBJ,

00:55:53.710 --> 00:55:55.420
created the Civil Rights Act.

00:55:55.420 --> 00:55:57.390
So this is the turning point.

00:55:57.390 --> 00:56:01.940
And they're all about to
go confront the police.

00:56:01.940 --> 00:56:06.060
And instead, he pulls
them all them all down,

00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.190
taps into his
intuition and goes, no.

00:56:08.190 --> 00:56:10.580
And asks everyone to go.

00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:13.080
And the next scene
in the film is a guy

00:56:13.080 --> 00:56:15.510
going, but everyone parade.

00:56:15.510 --> 00:56:18.540
He goes, he tapped
into his intuition.

00:56:18.540 --> 00:56:21.110
He let go of the
plan in order to do

00:56:21.110 --> 00:56:23.595
was he realized was
right in that moment.

00:56:23.595 --> 00:56:25.470
And the higher up you
get in an organization,

00:56:25.470 --> 00:56:27.053
the more you have
to trust that thing.

00:56:27.053 --> 00:56:30.480
Because there's no public
data for the future.

00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:32.830
And I call it intuition,
but you know, people call it

00:56:32.830 --> 00:56:35.190
different things.

00:56:35.190 --> 00:56:36.650
One more question?

00:56:36.650 --> 00:56:37.400
One more question?

00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:38.882
I'll be here for half an
hour, if anyone wants to.

00:56:38.882 --> 00:56:40.358
MALE SPEAKER: Yeah, we're
going to go for lunch.

00:56:40.358 --> 00:56:42.860
If anyone wants to come for
lunch, let's leave at 1:30.

00:56:42.860 --> 00:56:44.110
So, thank you very much, Nick.

00:56:44.110 --> 00:56:45.610
NICK JANKEL: Thank
you very much.
