00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.160
Yeah market segmentation
is probably at the very,

00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:06.620
very center of a go to market
strategy that's successful.

00:00:06.620 --> 00:00:09.620
So first let's talk about
what is a market segment.

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:14.030
So a market segment is a group of
people that have two things in common.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:15.250
One is a used case.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:18.590
They have a common set of needs that
they would be fulfilling through

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:20.860
a product like yours or someone elses.

00:00:20.860 --> 00:00:24.730
And secondly, and this is the one
people miss, they talk to each other.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:28.290
So a segment is actually a unit of
conversation and therefore, and

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:32.479
the reason why that's so important is
if you can get your marketing message

00:00:32.479 --> 00:00:36.350
circulating inside a segment,
the segment will circulate it for you.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:38.350
No entrepreneur can afford to go out and

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.400
pay to address every prospect
that they want to sell to.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.060
You have to have your
community selling for you.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:49.230
But that means you have to be able to
model the boundaries of that community

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:53.230
and be able to aim your marketing
communications activities in

00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:58.850
a way that that community embraces them
and it resonates inside that community.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:02.020
So just to make that
point crystal clear.

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.780
When yo talk about your product,
your saying things that apply to many

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.450
communities, that will not
resonate inside a community.

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:13.350
When you talk about the specific needs
of that community in the language that

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:17.650
community talks to itself about even
when your not talking about you

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:19.480
now your going to resonate
with that community.

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.510
So this market segmentation
in that sense.

00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.790
Is a communications vehicle to make sure
you talk the talk of the customer so

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.730
they can then walk the walk
with you going forward.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:30.940
That's idea number one.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.830
The second thing about market
segmentation and this is kind of a fun

00:01:35.830 --> 00:01:37.730
experience you have if you've
been marketing for awhile.

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:40.950
Fun if you like learning with pain.

00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:44.150
So, the idea is whenever
you think about a segment,

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:49.530
people usually draw a circle they say,
okay so we're targeting this segment.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:53.430
And then inevitably somebody comes along
and says, what about this customer who's

00:01:53.430 --> 00:01:57.290
right at the edge of the circle and
almost inside but not quite.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.210
And then well you,
well okay we'll bring them in too.

00:01:59.210 --> 00:02:01.750
And then well, we'll bring these
people in here, and then we'll bring.

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.250
And pretty soon there's just no
integrity in the process at all.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:09.229
So what we've learned about segments
is you cannot define a segment

00:02:09.229 --> 00:02:10.389
by its boundary.

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:12.890
because wherever you draw a line
there'll be somebody just on the other

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:17.310
side of that line who's pretty
darn close to the segment, right.

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:20.950
So what you do instead is you define
segments by their center points.

00:02:20.950 --> 00:02:23.200
This is where they get this
idea called the poster child.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.150
The poster child is
the perfect exemplar, the ideal

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:32.430
representation of the target customer
with the compelling reason to buy.

00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:37.030
And that person, and often you create
something they call a persona,

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:41.210
which would be the embodiment
of that target customer, and

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:45.380
then you aim all of your marketing
communications at that one person

00:02:45.380 --> 00:02:48.760
because they resonate with
all the people around them.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:52.110
And furthermore you get your engineering
and you name, aim all of your

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:56.600
engineering at solving the use case
exactly the way that customer would like

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.640
it solved, and again that engineering
will resonate with people around, and so

00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:07.250
therefore you can act on the world
in units of used cases and

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:08.800
word of mouth groups.

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.670
And so segmentation is designed to
allow you to leverage engineering

00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.490
to the point where
the world is on your side.

00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:18.770
As soon as you go outside the use
case and as soon as you go outside

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:21.880
the conversation group the world
is no longer working with you.

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:25.260
They may not be working against you,
but they're not working with you.

00:03:25.260 --> 00:03:27.030
And as an entrepreneur,
at the beginning,

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:30.340
you desperately need
the world to work with you.

00:03:30.340 --> 00:03:32.880
Eventually, if you become
a global standard,

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.180
then you don't need conversation groups.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.440
Google does not need a conversation
group, it is a global standard.

00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.180
But most of us are not Google, and
so particularly at the beginning.

00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.040
And even at the beginning,

00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.740
Google was not Google, so how do you
get started with those early groups?
