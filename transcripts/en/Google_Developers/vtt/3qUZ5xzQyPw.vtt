DON DODGE: Hi, I'm Don Dodge
and this is Google Root Access.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.030
Today my guest is
Misha Leybovich.

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:15.320
He's president and
CEO of Meograph.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:15.820
Welcome.

00:00:15.820 --> 00:00:16.540
MISHA LEYBOVICH: Thanks!

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:17.010
Good to be here.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:18.640
DON DODGE: So tell
me about Meograph.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:19.390
What is it?

00:00:19.390 --> 00:00:20.150
What does it do?

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:23.380
MISHA LEYBOVICH: So we're a
multimedia creation platform.

00:00:23.380 --> 00:00:27.470
Makes it easy to combine video,
audio, images, text, links,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.530
music, other interactive.

00:00:29.530 --> 00:00:31.990
Very simple interface
and compelling output

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:36.150
that's kind of like multimedia
stories, mixes, and mashups.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.340
And that's what we've had live
on our site for about a year.

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.180
Where people come,
they create content,

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.930
then they share it
via social networks

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:46.080
or embed it other places.

00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.905
What we're moving
towards now, and what

00:00:47.905 --> 00:00:49.980
we're going to
talk about here, is

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:53.360
we're now licensing that
creation platform itself

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.660
to other companies so they
can embed it in their site

00:00:56.660 --> 00:01:00.630
as a native branded experience
with all the enterprise

00:01:00.630 --> 00:01:01.740
features around it.

00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:06.710
And engage their customers and
creating user generated content

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.860
about their brands, their
products, and their services.

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:12.420
DON DODGE: So let's
talk business models.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:15.449
You started with
the a B to C model.

00:01:15.449 --> 00:01:16.240
Tell us about that.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:16.880
How did that work?

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:18.340
MISHA LEYBOVICH:
Well at first, I

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:20.400
was just trying to
solve my own problem.

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.220
That I had done a lot of
traveling after college.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:25.380
I had been to about 70
countries in the seven years

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:26.080
after college.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.500
And had a lot of cool
media, love telling stories,

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:35.770
but I have no multimedia
creation skills.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:37.770
Don't know how to use
Final Cut Pro or Photoshop

00:01:37.770 --> 00:01:40.000
or Premiere or anything.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.900
So I just want a way to
create richer content

00:01:42.900 --> 00:01:45.395
myself to tell cool
stories online.

00:01:45.395 --> 00:01:47.270
In a way that I felt it
was native to the way

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:48.742
with all these different media.

00:01:48.742 --> 00:01:50.450
So we put it out there
just because, hey,

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:53.210
if I like doing it, other
people might like doing it too,

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:55.740
and let's see what happens.

00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.670
So it has been great.

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:59.560
We've grown very fast.

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:04.940
We have tens of thousands
of regular users.

00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.520
Yesterday, we had over
half a million page views.

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:09.880
So we're doing well.

00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:13.630
But as we really started
to think about it,

00:02:13.630 --> 00:02:17.420
like where does the business
actually exists there?

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:22.260
We started to realize, gosh,
it's difficult to actually

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:26.030
build a business
off of storytelling,

00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:29.230
a consumer
ad-supported business.

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:32.190
Because for that, you
need tens or hundreds

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:37.570
of millions users that use
you weekly, if not daily.

00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.940
And storytelling
is something that

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.660
is valuable and important
but not frequent.

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:46.270
Maybe a couple times of year.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.740
So that sort of model
wasn't going to work for us.

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:55.710
So we start to think
about more B to B. Offer

00:02:55.710 --> 00:02:58.830
this for other businesses
to create content themselves

00:02:58.830 --> 00:03:01.700
about their brands.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.060
And there we found
that our product,

00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:07.840
while interesting and
different, the end result of it

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.550
was not differentiated enough
from them just going and hiring

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:17.170
a video crew to do something
custom, exactly as they need.

00:03:17.170 --> 00:03:19.980
Hard to build a
business that way.

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:24.500
But as we started talking
to these businesses

00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:26.700
and we're talking
the marketers, we

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.830
said look, you want
your customers,

00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:31.350
your audience, to
create content.

00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:34.570
You want them to be engaged, you
would buzz around your brand.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:36.900
Why don't you get them to
use our product, it's totally

00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:40.360
consumer grade and super
easy, to create content

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:43.120
about your business.

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:48.300
And the feedback we kept getting
was we like your product and we

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.430
like our customers
taking this action,

00:03:51.430 --> 00:03:53.057
but how is it going to work?

00:03:53.057 --> 00:03:54.640
We're going to send
them to your site,

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:57.290
and they're going to create
an account on Meograph,

00:03:57.290 --> 00:03:57.931
create content.

00:03:57.931 --> 00:04:00.180
Spend all the time, by the
way, and all the engagement

00:04:00.180 --> 00:04:02.910
on your site rather than
ours, grab the embed code,

00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.650
if they know what that is,
come back and paste it.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:07.150
Ta da!

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.960
It's a lot of steps.

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.730
And so we started
thinking about well

00:04:11.730 --> 00:04:14.130
if we could provide
this on your site

00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:18.660
as a branded native experience,
is that interesting?

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.779
And there we started to really
get very positive feedback

00:04:21.779 --> 00:04:22.460
from companies.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:26.430
DON DODGE: So the product
solves a complexity problem

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:31.690
and makes it easier for mere
mortals to create nice content.

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:34.130
So you found a problem
and you solved it,

00:04:34.130 --> 00:04:38.000
but in applying a
revenue model to it,

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.340
consumers weren't
willing to pay,

00:04:41.340 --> 00:04:46.260
businesses had alternatives
it wasn't that differentiated.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:49.340
So B2C didn't work,
B2B didn't work,

00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:54.830
and now you're doing B2B2c
where the business' media

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:57.260
companies are your
customers, and they're

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.390
the ones that are
pay, and the consumers

00:04:59.390 --> 00:05:00.855
are using it and
creating content.

00:05:00.855 --> 00:05:01.813
MISHA LEYBOVICH: Right.

00:05:01.813 --> 00:05:02.670
That's exactly it.

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.165
It's very difficult.

00:05:05.165 --> 00:05:08.030
It's difficult to get a
consumer's time and creativity

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:09.380
in the first place.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.450
To get their money as well,
is nye impossible to the scale

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.280
of building a
really big business.

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.030
DON DODGE: So let's
talk about the pivots.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.250
So you pivoted now three times.

00:05:21.250 --> 00:05:22.830
Typically when you
pivot, you think,

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:25.210
well if I only
added more features,

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.640
or if I could make
it easier to use,

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:31.030
or if I tried different
marketing it would work.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:34.830
So making those
pivot decisions, how

00:05:34.830 --> 00:05:37.710
did you get through that to
decide, no I've got to change?

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.730
MISHA LEYBOVICH: You just got
to be honest with yourself

00:05:41.730 --> 00:05:46.150
about what your product is, what
it's good at and what it's not,

00:05:46.150 --> 00:05:50.880
and ultimately what
real business value

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:52.460
you're providing to someone.

00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:55.044
Because someone is going
to write you a check.

00:05:55.044 --> 00:05:56.460
If it's a
consumer-based business,

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.690
its advertisers writing a check.

00:05:57.690 --> 00:05:59.148
But someone is
writing you a check.

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.930
We just had to really think
about what does our product do

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:09.912
and what real problem
does it solve for someone

00:06:09.912 --> 00:06:10.870
that can write a check.

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:16.810
This sounds like a silly thing,
like it should be obvious.

00:06:16.810 --> 00:06:20.150
But before this, I was
at McKinsey &amp; Company,

00:06:20.150 --> 00:06:22.750
a big business consulting
firm for two years.

00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:27.850
Did a lot of business problems,
and you would think that that

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:32.040
would be self apparent, but
I think a lot of the culture

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:36.890
around early-stage
entrepreneurship right now is,

00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.560
like Paul Graham says, "Build
something people want. "

00:06:39.560 --> 00:06:42.180
And that's important.

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:43.170
That's a baseline.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.700
That's table stakes.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.210
But it's not sufficient.

00:06:47.210 --> 00:06:50.200
You have to build
something that people want

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.850
and that someone will pay for.

00:06:52.850 --> 00:06:55.110
Someone will write a
check at some point.

00:06:55.110 --> 00:06:58.430
And so we just had to
be honest with ourselves

00:06:58.430 --> 00:07:03.710
as we went along this journey as
to what value are we providing

00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:07.680
for someone, how can we
help them get promoted

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:10.970
or not get fired, whoever it
is that's writing the check,

00:07:10.970 --> 00:07:13.010
and how do we give
them the things

00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.275
that they need where they can
prove the value around it?

00:07:16.275 --> 00:07:17.150
DON DODGE: Awesome!

00:07:17.150 --> 00:07:21.640
So where these true pivots where
you stopped doing something

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.470
and started doing
it a different way,

00:07:23.470 --> 00:07:28.830
or today do you still have a B2C
direct-to-consumer component,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.465
a direct-to-business component,
and now this new model?

00:07:31.465 --> 00:07:33.780
MISHA LEYBOVICH: It's
really been an evolution.

00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:36.714
If you come to our site, you
can still create content there

00:07:36.714 --> 00:07:37.880
and then embed it elsewhere.

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.610
And that's great for us,
it's a great publicity.

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:43.230
People buzz about the product.

00:07:43.230 --> 00:07:43.850
And we learn.

00:07:43.850 --> 00:07:47.870
We learn from hearing
user feedback about it.

00:07:47.870 --> 00:07:50.050
Businesses still use it.

00:07:50.050 --> 00:07:52.750
Major news orgs still just
use us, embed us in their page

00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:56.080
to tell multimedia stories
and businesses do too.

00:07:56.080 --> 00:08:01.110
And so now our new build
is all these enterprise

00:08:01.110 --> 00:08:03.560
features around to
the creation product.

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.170
So when you embed
it in your site now,

00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:09.010
you have the moderation, the
analytics, the customization,

00:08:09.010 --> 00:08:11.380
the ability to embed it
with one line of code

00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:14.960
so it's not complex to do.

00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:18.190
It's all on top of
the core product.

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:22.730
And it all still stays true
to the original mission

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:27.660
of just wanting to make
it easy for mere mortals

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.950
to create rich content and
express themselves and tell

00:08:31.950 --> 00:08:34.450
stories about things
that they care about.

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:37.220
And now we're allowing
people to do that

00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:39.760
but really providing
value to the people who

00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:43.904
are willing to pay and benefit
when that thing happens.

00:08:43.904 --> 00:08:47.090
DON DODGE: So you solved
the customer problem

00:08:47.090 --> 00:08:49.920
or the complexity
problem fairly early on,

00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:52.040
but the real journey
was figuring out

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:54.030
what is the revenue
model and business

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:56.574
model that can make this
into this a business.

00:08:56.574 --> 00:08:57.490
MISHA LEYBOVICH: Sure.

00:08:57.490 --> 00:08:59.280
And to be honest,
sometimes you just

00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.690
got to wonder in the
desert for a little bit

00:09:01.690 --> 00:09:03.230
until you figure it out.

00:09:03.230 --> 00:09:06.510
I don't think that we would have
stumbled across this problem

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:07.540
that marketers have.

00:09:07.540 --> 00:09:09.819
They're thinking about the
rise of content marketing,

00:09:09.819 --> 00:09:11.610
they're thinking about
more user engagement

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:15.330
and two-way relationships
with their customer base.

00:09:15.330 --> 00:09:18.330
I didn't know all
that when we started.

00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.450
Nor would we have had a
consumer grade end-product

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:24.320
that was good enough for them.

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:27.680
So it's OK to wander
for a little bit

00:09:27.680 --> 00:09:32.670
and figure it out, but at some
point not too long after that,

00:09:32.670 --> 00:09:35.710
you have to think about
what really, really

00:09:35.710 --> 00:09:37.492
what does the
business come down to?

00:09:37.492 --> 00:09:42.180
DON DODGE: So the lesson
then for founders and viewers

00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:47.840
is keep trying different revenue
models and business models.

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:50.440
Sometimes you have the
technical problems solved,

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.165
it's how do you
make it a business.

00:09:52.165 --> 00:09:53.123
MISHA LEYBOVICH: Right.

00:09:53.123 --> 00:09:55.530
And if you don't have
it figured out to start,

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.650
don't use it as an excuse
to not get started.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.777
Get going, try something,
put it out there,

00:09:59.777 --> 00:10:01.610
and get some validation
that at least you've

00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:03.420
built something
that people want.

00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:06.250
But don't have your
business strategy

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.140
rely on a hope and a prayer that
you catch lightning in a bottle

00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:16.320
and that it becomes an overnight
part of the cultural Zeitgeist.

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.120
If it is, then great.

00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.190
But it's good to
really think about

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.129
where can you provide business
value around whatever it

00:10:23.129 --> 00:10:23.920
is you're building.

00:10:23.920 --> 00:10:25.394
DON DODGE: Great advice.

00:10:25.394 --> 00:10:26.310
Well thank you, Misha.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:27.290
Thank you for joining us.

00:10:27.290 --> 00:10:28.190
MISHA LEYBOVICH: Thank you.

00:10:28.190 --> 00:10:30.231
DON DODGE: I'd like to
remind our viewers that we

00:10:30.231 --> 00:10:32.590
have a $2000 credit
for Google Cloud.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:36.050
So if you're developing
applications in the cloud,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:39.700
try out the Google Cloud and
get a $2000 credit for doing it.

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:43.650
The way to sign up for it
will be right on your screen.

00:10:43.650 --> 00:10:47.140
Thank you for joining us
