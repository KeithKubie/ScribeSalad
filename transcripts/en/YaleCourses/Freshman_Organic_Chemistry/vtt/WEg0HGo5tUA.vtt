WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:07.230
Okay.
So what's coming for the next exam?
Well,
we've been looking at Adams,

2
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.090
uh,
and at the idea of orbitals for many electron atoms,

3
00:00:12.091 --> 00:00:13.950
which we showed last time is wrong.

4
00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:17.700
So today we want to recover from the orbital approximation.

5
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.210
Okay?
Then we're going to look at molecules.

6
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.810
And first we're going to look at them in a very unconventional way from the

7
00:00:24.811 --> 00:00:28.130
point of view of plump molecules as plum puddings,

8
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:32.850
what's called the United Adam limit to apply what we know from atoms to

9
00:00:32.851 --> 00:00:35.460
molecules.
But then we're gonna look at a very,

10
00:00:35.461 --> 00:00:40.461
very different way of looking at it to try to understand bonds in terms of what

11
00:00:40.651 --> 00:00:43.230
are called linear combinations.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:48.500
That means weighted sums of molecular orbitals of atomic orbitals to make

13
00:00:48.601 --> 00:00:49.710
molecular orbitals.

14
00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.890
But we're gonna try understanding bonds and then these terms that don't mean

15
00:00:55.231 --> 00:00:59.040
much to you now,
but will mean a lot later on.
Energy match and overlap.

16
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:04.050
And then,
uh,
we're going to get to reality.
All this stuff is theory,

17
00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:08.730
but we're going to look at something real at x h three molecules with different

18
00:01:08.731 --> 00:01:12.270
items for x at their structure and that at their dynamics.

19
00:01:12.271 --> 00:01:15.030
And how that ties in with our understanding of bonding.

20
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:20.790
And then we'll go on to reactivity,
which is of course the main,
uh,
goal.

21
00:01:21.210 --> 00:01:21.810
Uh,

22
00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:26.810
we talk about homos and Lumos and you'll see what those are and how to recognize

23
00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:29.490
functional groups in their reactivity.

24
00:01:29.491 --> 00:01:31.590
And that's the real prize is to be able to,

25
00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:35.250
you've been memorizing functional groups for this previous exam.

26
00:01:35.251 --> 00:01:39.120
But what I want you to be able to do is look at a molecule and recognize when it

27
00:01:39.121 --> 00:01:40.350
has a functional group,

28
00:01:40.620 --> 00:01:43.440
even if you've never seen it before and how it might react,

29
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:44.610
what it would react with.

30
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.930
And then we're going to see how organic chemistry really developed the real

31
00:01:48.931 --> 00:01:53.490
thing,
how it developed from the time of Lavoie Ca.
Uh,

32
00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:57.660
okay.
So that's what we're going to do.
And here's where we were last time.

33
00:01:57.661 --> 00:02:01.620
We were wondering,
when it comes to a two electron wave function,

34
00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.780
might it be possible to write it as a product of one electron wave functions?

35
00:02:06.781 --> 00:02:09.870
Because we know how to write one electron wave functions.
We've got that table.

36
00:02:09.871 --> 00:02:12.840
We can write the real thing,
at least for an Adam.
Uh,

37
00:02:12.841 --> 00:02:14.760
so if it were possible to write the,

38
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:20.210
the a six variable two electron wave function as a product of one electron wave

39
00:02:20.221 --> 00:02:20.970
functions,

40
00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:25.620
that would be a fantastic simplification and all we'd have to do is square and

41
00:02:25.621 --> 00:02:27.330
we'd get the joint probability.

42
00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:31.110
Not really that you care very much about the joint probability.

43
00:02:31.111 --> 00:02:35.610
I suspect you haven't stayed up late nights worrying about joint probability.

44
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.020
But anyhow,
if you want to handle things with more than one electron,

45
00:02:40.021 --> 00:02:41.970
you have to have it to electron wave function.

46
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.940
And if we could do it from one electron wave functions,

47
00:02:44.941 --> 00:02:47.790
then we're really in a good position.

48
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:53.540
But we ended the last quarter of the first quarter of the semester on a downer.

49
00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.900
The idea that there's no way electrons can be independent,

50
00:02:57.901 --> 00:03:02.740
they repel one another.
So orbitals are fundamentally wrong.
Okay,

51
00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:08.340
so forget that and here's our paradise.

52
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.140
It's gone.
Okay.

53
00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:16.600
But are there tricks that would allow us to salvage or bottles to use them even

54
00:03:16.601 --> 00:03:19.900
though we know they're wrong?
Okay,
well the first,

55
00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:23.110
the simple minded trick is z effective.

56
00:03:23.770 --> 00:03:28.770
We talked about how you could scale the one electron wave functions that at

57
00:03:29.441 --> 00:03:32.160
atomic orbitals for nuclear charge,
if you take,

58
00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:33.640
if you increase the nuclear charge,

59
00:03:33.641 --> 00:03:37.270
they contract and we saw what is different properties are proportional to.

60
00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.320
So if you have other electrons in the atom,

61
00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.100
it could be that they could be sort of approximated as if they were just

62
00:03:48.341 --> 00:03:51.250
reducing the nuclear charge,
right?

63
00:03:51.251 --> 00:03:54.610
There's a certain repulsion as well as an attraction taking place if there are

64
00:03:54.611 --> 00:03:58.600
other electrons there,
but maybe we can just reduce the attraction,

65
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:01.010
right?
And,
and uh,

66
00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.990
things will be sort of at least correct it in the right direction,
right?

67
00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:10.320
So pretend that the other electrons or some fraction of them are concentrated at

68
00:04:10.721 --> 00:04:14.350
the nucleus.
So from the point of view of an electron,
you're thinking about,

69
00:04:14.351 --> 00:04:17.350
they just reduce the nuclear charge and that's a problem.

70
00:04:17.351 --> 00:04:21.310
We know how to handle what happens if you change the nuclear charge.
Okay.

71
00:04:21.910 --> 00:04:25.660
So might there be an effective nuclear charge that we could use?

72
00:04:25.661 --> 00:04:30.160
So we pretend the other electrons just reduce the nuclear charge for the

73
00:04:30.161 --> 00:04:32.470
electron.
We're interested in the orbital,

74
00:04:32.471 --> 00:04:34.750
the one electron wave function that we want to find.

75
00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:38.830
So we're going to just try to find a one electron wave function in a many

76
00:04:38.831 --> 00:04:41.380
electron problem,
okay?

77
00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:46.060
And this is what we know that one s looks like that and row scales with z.

78
00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:49.060
So if I just reduce z a little bit,

79
00:04:49.090 --> 00:04:53.110
maybe I get something at least is corrected in the right direction.
Okay?

80
00:04:53.111 --> 00:04:55.090
Now these guys,

81
00:04:55.091 --> 00:05:00.091
Clemente and Ramondetta who worked at IBM in the early days when IBM was the

82
00:05:00.461 --> 00:05:02.320
only place that had,
uh,

83
00:05:02.350 --> 00:05:06.340
computers that were as powerful as your laptop or almost as powerful as your

84
00:05:06.341 --> 00:05:07.174
laptop,

85
00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.440
they did things like this where they did good quality calculations better than

86
00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:13.030
than,
than this.

87
00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:18.010
And then tried to match the wave functions they got by adjusting Z.

88
00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:22.210
So they looked like the wave functions that you get with better approximations,

89
00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.080
right?
So they've got a best fit to better calculation.
So they,

90
00:05:26.081 --> 00:05:28.840
they found that helium,
which has two electrons,

91
00:05:28.841 --> 00:05:31.510
so it has a nuclear charge of Tuesday equals two.

92
00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:37.360
You get electrons distributed more or less,
right?

93
00:05:37.690 --> 00:05:42.690
If you pretend that the nuclear charge is 1.69 instead of two.

94
00:05:43.660 --> 00:05:48.280
Okay.
So each electron sort of what's called screens,

95
00:05:48.610 --> 00:05:52.090
the nucleus that the electron from the nucleus.
Right.

96
00:05:53.140 --> 00:05:54.290
Okay.
Uh,

97
00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:58.970
now in the case of which has z equals six,

98
00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.070
you can also use the effective,
but it's different depending,

99
00:06:03.090 --> 00:06:06.650
depending on which electron you're talking about.
Why would that be?

100
00:06:06.651 --> 00:06:11.651
So why would it be that you'd use a different screening constant or a different

101
00:06:12.321 --> 00:06:17.321
effective z if you're talking about the one s orbital than if you're talking

102
00:06:17.511 --> 00:06:21.800
about the two s orbital say,
why would,
why would it be different?

103
00:06:21.801 --> 00:06:24.170
How much you want to reduce the nuclear charge?
Sherwin.

104
00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:31.300
Yeah,
the electrons that are outside you don't care about.

105
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:34.810
It's the electrons that are between you and the nucleus that are screening you

106
00:06:34.811 --> 00:06:39.550
from the nucleus.
Right?
So a one s is already really close to the nucleus.

107
00:06:39.551 --> 00:06:43.240
There's very little other electron density that's inside it,
right?

108
00:06:43.241 --> 00:06:45.970
That's why and helium,
it wasn't screened very much,

109
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:50.560
but in the case of of carbon,
that one s electrons,

110
00:06:50.561 --> 00:06:53.290
which are way down near the near the nucleus,

111
00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.720
have an effective charge that's almost six 5.67 but the two s have 3.22 right.

112
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:05.490
The one s electrons are all down inside and making the,

113
00:07:05.730 --> 00:07:10.390
the nuclear charge appear small.
Right.
And to a certain extent the other,

114
00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.660
the two P electrons are also inside to a certain extent,

115
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:17.290
but not as much inside as the one s is.

116
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:22.440
So 3.22 and the z effective for two P is different than for two s it's 3.14 what

117
00:07:24.161 --> 00:07:25.900
do you notice about those two numbers?

118
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:29.560
You might think they'd be more or less the same and they are more or less the

119
00:07:29.561 --> 00:07:33.910
same,
but two s is slightly less screened.

120
00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:37.570
It sees more of the nucleus than the two P does.

121
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:39.993
Okay.

122
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:45.720
So it looks like two s gets more down inside than two p does.

123
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:47.980
Does that surprise you

124
00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.313
<v 1>Russell?</v>

125
00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:59.120
<v 0>Yeah.
The dumbbell doesn't have anything at the nucleus.
Right.</v>

126
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.710
It's got a node at the nucleus.

127
00:08:00.890 --> 00:08:05.180
Whereas two s has that first little core down in the stuff that's inside.

128
00:08:05.181 --> 00:08:08.840
It's first spherical node is down quite close to the nucleus.

129
00:08:09.140 --> 00:08:10.370
Now we could look at that.

130
00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:14.780
There's what two s looks like and here's the probability distribution that we

131
00:08:14.781 --> 00:08:19.100
talked about.
R squared times the functions,
the radio function squared.

132
00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:22.190
So this stuff that's in here is inside.

133
00:08:22.191 --> 00:08:24.680
If we compare it with the two p orbital,

134
00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:28.040
you'll see that this part is way down inside.

135
00:08:28.041 --> 00:08:32.750
It's not being screened by the two plx trons.
Right.
In fact,

136
00:08:32.751 --> 00:08:37.520
we could also look at the one s this is how the one s is distributed,
right?

137
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:42.170
So the one s will,
we'll screen this,
sorry.
And of course it's screens.

138
00:08:42.171 --> 00:08:46.220
This part of the,
of the two s and it screens this are the two p.

139
00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:50.510
But it's not really trivial to look at this and figure out which one would be

140
00:08:50.511 --> 00:08:51.410
more screened.

141
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:57.010
The two s or the two p because this part is further in than this part,

142
00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:01.140
but this part is way down inside.

143
00:09:01.410 --> 00:09:04.800
So it's a balancing act as though as to exactly which one would be bigger.

144
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:07.110
And they're not very different.
But as it turned out,

145
00:09:07.111 --> 00:09:09.810
according to Clemente and Ramon Day,
in their calculations,

146
00:09:10.040 --> 00:09:14.370
that the z effective that you should use for two s is a little bit bigger than

147
00:09:14.371 --> 00:09:15.990
the one you should use for two P.
Kevin,

148
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:18.130
<v 1>why are there two peaks sent to us?</v>

149
00:09:20.190 --> 00:09:23.580
<v 0>Because there's a radio node member two minus row.</v>

150
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.070
The function is two minus row.

151
00:09:26.071 --> 00:09:31.071
So at here's a zero to a zero when the distance is two two minus two is zero.

152
00:09:32.581 --> 00:09:36.210
There's a node there,
okay?
And it's been squared.

153
00:09:36.211 --> 00:09:39.510
Of course it's the wave function changes signed,
but here we square it.

154
00:09:40.710 --> 00:09:45.410
Any other questions about this?
Okay,

155
00:09:45.411 --> 00:09:47.510
now let's look at sodium.

156
00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:52.310
So sodium has a nuclear charge of 11 and you won't be surprised to see that z

157
00:09:52.311 --> 00:09:57.110
effective for the one s electrons of sodium is 10.63 almost 11.

158
00:09:57.111 --> 00:09:58.280
They're very little screened.

159
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:03.790
A two s a 6.57 a two P is 6.8 but three s is only two and a half,

160
00:10:05.930 --> 00:10:10.520
right?
Because it's further out still.
So they're more electrons inside.
Uh,

161
00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:14.900
hiding the nucleus.
Everybody got the idea of what's going on here.

162
00:10:15.230 --> 00:10:18.320
You notice one thing sort of funny here,
do you notice what

163
00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:23.850
<v 1>John Hot</v>

164
00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:27.270
<v 0>turns around this time?
It's vice versa,
right?</v>

165
00:10:27.271 --> 00:10:29.400
So it's a balancing act and who knows?

166
00:10:29.401 --> 00:10:31.770
And there's nothing fundamental about this.

167
00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:35.820
This was just adjusted by Clemente and Ramon Day in order to get shapes that

168
00:10:35.821 --> 00:10:38.520
look pretty much like better quality shapes.

169
00:10:40.620 --> 00:10:42.900
Okay?
Uh,

170
00:10:44.490 --> 00:10:48.750
so it's very subtle thing,
but this is very crude,

171
00:10:49.410 --> 00:10:53.220
right?
Nobody argues that it's that it's the last word.
Uh,

172
00:10:53.221 --> 00:10:56.970
so isn't there a better way to do it?
And there is a better way to do it,

173
00:10:57.350 --> 00:11:01.770
to get back to orbitals even for many electron problems.

174
00:11:01.771 --> 00:11:06.120
And that's called self consistent field or SCF.

175
00:11:06.990 --> 00:11:11.990
And it's a recipe for calculating orbitals for calculating better orbitals than

176
00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:15.930
you would get with an effective z.

177
00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:21.860
So first you go through all the electrons in an atom or a molecule and you find

178
00:11:24.060 --> 00:11:26.670
an approximate form of the orbitals.
For example,

179
00:11:26.671 --> 00:11:30.780
you could use the effective to get something that's sort of approximate.
Okay?

180
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.410
So you have approximate wave functions,
square them,

181
00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:39.450
you have approximate distributions for all the electrons.
Now with z effective,

182
00:11:39.451 --> 00:11:43.230
what we were pretending was that a certain fraction of the other electrons are

183
00:11:43.231 --> 00:11:47.790
on the nucleus and the rest of them we forget.
That's pretty crude.

184
00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:49.140
Okay.

185
00:11:49.140 --> 00:11:52.830
Now what we're going to do is pretend we know at least approximately how the

186
00:11:52.831 --> 00:11:57.280
other are distributed in the cloud.
The other electrons,

187
00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:02.170
we're interested in one electron and orbital right now.

188
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:05.650
How will knowing how the other electrons are distributed,

189
00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:10.540
help us find the orbital.
We're interested in the one electron wave function.

190
00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:13.840
What do you need in order to solve a quantum mechanical problem?

191
00:12:13.841 --> 00:12:18.040
You need the mass of the electron.
That's easy.
What else do you need?

192
00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:21.730
The potential law,
what its energy is,

193
00:12:21.731 --> 00:12:23.620
it's potential energy at different positions,

194
00:12:23.830 --> 00:12:27.580
but if you know where the nucleus is or nuclei,
right,

195
00:12:27.910 --> 00:12:31.930
and you know the cloud of the other electrons and assume they're just static

196
00:12:31.931 --> 00:12:36.520
clouds,
then you connect.
It's laborious.
You need a computer to do it,

197
00:12:36.850 --> 00:12:40.840
but you can calculate the potential that the electron you're interested in would

198
00:12:40.841 --> 00:12:42.160
have at different positions.

199
00:12:42.161 --> 00:12:45.730
If there were this fixed cloud of other electrons and the nuclei.

200
00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:47.350
So you have the potential law,

201
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:50.470
which means you can find your one electron orbital.

202
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:52.203
<v 1>Okay,</v>

203
00:12:52.560 --> 00:12:54.470
<v 0>did everybody see this?
The strategy here?</v>

204
00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:57.620
So we're going to do it one electron at the time.
So we,

205
00:12:57.740 --> 00:12:59.900
we fix all the other electrons,

206
00:13:00.770 --> 00:13:05.770
all but one from some crummy estimate like the z effective or something like

207
00:13:05.871 --> 00:13:10.130
that.
Calculate the potential for,
for the one electron we're interested in.

208
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:15.460
And then we get use that potential to calculate an orbital for that one

209
00:13:15.891 --> 00:13:19.340
electron.
That's better than if we had used as the effective,
right?

210
00:13:19.341 --> 00:13:22.070
Because it's not just putting a certain fraction of the other electrons at the

211
00:13:22.071 --> 00:13:23.780
nucleus,
it's treating them as a cloud.

212
00:13:25.270 --> 00:13:26.103
<v 1>Okay,</v>

213
00:13:26.740 --> 00:13:31.740
<v 0>so now we have a much better guests for that one electron than we would have had</v>

214
00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:37.300
earlier with z effective or whatever type of gas.
What do you do next?

215
00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:45.030
Any other work?
One of the time you,
you,

216
00:13:45.031 --> 00:13:49.590
you now know how that one is distributed in the cloud,
much better,
right?
So,

217
00:13:49.591 --> 00:13:53.730
and you take all the others but one fix them and their approximate clouds.

218
00:13:53.731 --> 00:13:57.300
Now you calculate the potential for the second electron and do that.

219
00:13:57.301 --> 00:13:58.920
Do that trick.
Okay,

220
00:13:58.921 --> 00:14:03.030
so we've repeat steps two and three to improve the orbital for another electron.

221
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:04.380
Then what do we do?

222
00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:09.330
<v 1>Well,
what would you do at this point?</v>

223
00:14:10.940 --> 00:14:14.570
<v 0>Well,
yeah,
it'll change shape.
That second electron will have a better shape now,</v>

224
00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.110
so you've got that.
You've got a good shape for the first electron.

225
00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.980
Now you've got an improved shape for the second electron.
What do you do?

226
00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:24.610
<v 1>Or the first</v>

227
00:14:25.110 --> 00:14:27.390
<v 0>are,
you know if there's a threat,
if there are three electrons,</v>

228
00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:33.840
you do the third one and then the fourth,
fifth,

229
00:14:33.841 --> 00:14:38.070
sixth until you get through all the electrons and then start over.

230
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:40.770
So you improve all the orbitals one by one,

231
00:14:41.700 --> 00:14:46.560
and then you cycle back to improve the first one again,
go through them all.

232
00:14:46.620 --> 00:14:50.750
Then what do you do?
Start again.

233
00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:52.010
Then what do you

234
00:14:52.010 --> 00:14:55.730
<v 1>do?
This is why it's good to have a computer,
right?
Then what are you doing?</v>

235
00:14:56.840 --> 00:15:00.440
When do you stop?
They'll stop.

236
00:15:01.050 --> 00:15:01.801
<v 0>At least you know,</v>

237
00:15:01.801 --> 00:15:05.040
it'll be like Arab and meets Goldie locks where it's out in the eight decimal

238
00:15:05.041 --> 00:15:06.450
place.
That things are changing.

239
00:15:06.451 --> 00:15:09.150
So then you know you've got in this closest as reasonable to go.

240
00:15:09.450 --> 00:15:11.970
So you stop and what do you call it when you,

241
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.780
<v 1>when you get to that sitch situation,
when you stop,</v>

242
00:15:15.710 --> 00:15:17.720
the system is self consistent,

243
00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:22.600
<v 0>right?
That's why it's a self consistent field.
Okay?</v>

244
00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:26.380
So you quit when the orbital steps shapes stop changing.

245
00:15:26.650 --> 00:15:30.880
So now you have the right wave functions,
right?

246
00:15:30.881 --> 00:15:35.710
The right orbitals.
So now we've got the real thing right or wrong.

247
00:15:37.740 --> 00:15:42.690
<v 1>What could be wrong?
We've got itself consistent.
Where is the,</v>

248
00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:46.710
where's the weakness in the assumption on which we'd been doing this?
Kevin,

249
00:15:51.270 --> 00:15:55.260
I'm assuming what you're saying,
take the position.
You're assuming that

250
00:15:55.330 --> 00:15:59.650
<v 0>all those other electrons,
except the one you're working on are fixed in clouds,</v>

251
00:15:59.830 --> 00:16:04.780
but they're not fixed,
right?
The electrons can move around.

252
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:08.500
So depending on where your electron happens to be,

253
00:16:09.220 --> 00:16:11.740
those other electrons may change their shape

254
00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:15.730
at any given instant.
Okay?

255
00:16:15.731 --> 00:16:19.210
It's still wrong because real electrons are not fixed in clouds.

256
00:16:19.211 --> 00:16:24.150
They keep out of each other's way by correlating their motion right there.

257
00:16:24.151 --> 00:16:26.680
Don't move independently so that this one is a cloud.

258
00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:29.470
And this one moves around and nothing happens as this one moves.

259
00:16:29.471 --> 00:16:33.310
When it gets near this place,
this one gets away.
Okay?

260
00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:37.090
So they keep out of other ways by correlating their motion.

261
00:16:37.540 --> 00:16:41.590
So the true energy must be lower,

262
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:46.450
more favorable than you calculate by self-consistent field because the orbitals

263
00:16:46.451 --> 00:16:48.940
are able to get away from where you think they should be.

264
00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.690
Is everybody clear on why that the limit goes in that direction?

265
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:57.550
Why the true energy is lower?
Because the,
the electrons are smarter than you are.

266
00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.650
They know to get out of each other's way or at least the new pretended.

267
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.940
Okay?
So what do you do?

268
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:12.420
You hide the residual error so that people won't embarrass you by saying,

269
00:17:13.421 --> 00:17:15.910
what the heck were you thinking?
Right?

270
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:19.660
You say that when you go to the heart tree foc limit,

271
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.410
which is a fancy name named after two people that stopped thought of doing this

272
00:17:23.411 --> 00:17:27.190
self-consistent field thing or thought of a method for doing it,
right?

273
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.450
When you get to the heart tree foc limit,
that's self-consistent field,

274
00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:36.160
but it's going to be an,
there's going to be an error because of correlation.

275
00:17:36.370 --> 00:17:40.020
So you give it a fancy name.
So people will think,
ah,

276
00:17:40.130 --> 00:17:44.320
that that's what in the heck is that?
They must really know a lot,
right?

277
00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:48.460
So what do you call the error?
You call it error.

278
00:17:49.830 --> 00:17:54.810
No Way.
Sophie,
do you know what you call it?
Correlation,
correlation.

279
00:17:54.811 --> 00:17:59.160
Energy,
right?
There is no such thing as correlation energy.

280
00:17:59.161 --> 00:18:00.780
That's not a fundamental energy.

281
00:18:01.020 --> 00:18:04.890
It's not like cool ohms law or gravity or something like that,
right?

282
00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:09.180
It's just the error you make when you do self consistent field that the true

283
00:18:09.181 --> 00:18:12.750
energy is lower.
Now,
if you want to measure correlation energy,

284
00:18:12.751 --> 00:18:13.860
what do you have to know?

285
00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:20.370
You got to know the true energy so that you know how bad your estimate is,

286
00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:21.360
right?

287
00:18:21.360 --> 00:18:25.740
And where do you get the correct energy or the true electron density that you

288
00:18:25.741 --> 00:18:26.640
have an error in.

289
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.800
You get it from experiment or you get it from some whopping calculation that's

290
00:18:34.531 --> 00:18:38.070
not as simple as SCF.
Okay?
For example,

291
00:18:38.071 --> 00:18:40.860
there's a thing called configuration interaction,

292
00:18:40.861 --> 00:18:43.500
which we won't know anything about and don't need to write,

293
00:18:44.070 --> 00:18:48.420
but it's a much more complicated calculation that takes into account the fact

294
00:18:48.421 --> 00:18:50.370
that electrons keep out of each other's way.

295
00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.900
Or there's another one called density functional theory,

296
00:18:54.901 --> 00:18:58.260
which is also an approximate.
They're all approximations.

297
00:18:58.261 --> 00:19:00.060
You can't solve the real equation,

298
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:04.320
but these are better approximations than just self-consistent field.

299
00:19:05.310 --> 00:19:05.700
Okay.

300
00:19:05.700 --> 00:19:10.320
But they're hard to think about because they involve so much manipulation that

301
00:19:10.321 --> 00:19:14.850
it's hard to reason about them.
Self-Consistent field is easier to understand,

302
00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:19.320
right?
So if we're really lucky though,

303
00:19:19.770 --> 00:19:23.790
correlation energy might be negligible.
It might be so small,

304
00:19:23.791 --> 00:19:28.020
we don't care about it.
In which case we're golden.
For practical purposes,

305
00:19:28.021 --> 00:19:32.430
we use orbitals self-consistent field orbitals treat things as if they were

306
00:19:32.431 --> 00:19:37.110
independent electrons.
Okay.
And then we're,
then we're in business.

307
00:19:37.590 --> 00:19:38.190
Okay?

308
00:19:38.190 --> 00:19:43.140
So we should think about the magnitude of energies and whether we care about

309
00:19:43.141 --> 00:19:47.280
correlation energy,
this error that is in orbital theory.

310
00:19:47.400 --> 00:19:49.770
What do I mean by saying orbital theory?

311
00:19:52.230 --> 00:19:56.430
What's an orbital,
uh,
one electron wave function?

312
00:19:56.431 --> 00:20:00.120
But we're trying to understand many electron problems.
Can we,

313
00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.150
and the analyze many electronic problems as sums of one electrons as sums of

314
00:20:06.661 --> 00:20:10.110
things that come from orbitals is the whole equal to the sum of the parts,

315
00:20:10.111 --> 00:20:14.310
the parts being orbitals.
We know that orbitals have to be fundamentally wrong,

316
00:20:14.550 --> 00:20:18.870
but if the error is,
if the correlation energy is really small,
we don't care.

317
00:20:18.871 --> 00:20:23.660
So should we care about the error in orbital theory?
So here's a,
here are a,

318
00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:27.660
is a scale of logarithmic scale of the energy changes that happen.

319
00:20:27.661 --> 00:20:32.610
When did that occur?
When things happen,
and how big are these energy changes?

320
00:20:32.611 --> 00:20:33.780
Let's start at the beginning.

321
00:20:33.990 --> 00:20:37.560
So we take a bunch of neutrons and protons and bring them together to make a

322
00:20:37.561 --> 00:20:40.380
nucleus and energy comes out right.

323
00:20:40.710 --> 00:20:45.710
And the amount of energy that that is given off when a c 12 nucleus is formed is

324
00:20:46.201 --> 00:20:50.200
two times 10 to the ninth kilocalories per mole.
How do I know?

325
00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:51.910
Because I look at the mass,

326
00:20:51.911 --> 00:20:56.860
the rest mass of the Proton and the neutron and I look at the mass of see 12 and

327
00:20:56.861 --> 00:21:00.040
mass was lost when it came together,
right?

328
00:21:00.041 --> 00:21:05.041
And the amount of mass last e equals MC squared is 0.1 atomic mass units,

329
00:21:06.461 --> 00:21:09.160
which is two times 10 to the ninth kilocalories per mole.

330
00:21:09.430 --> 00:21:12.460
So that's a lot of energy.
Okay.
Now,

331
00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:17.740
so we've got c plus six,
now we're going to put two electrons on it,

332
00:21:17.741 --> 00:21:20.980
the one s electrons of carbon,
right?
Bingo.

333
00:21:21.430 --> 00:21:26.430
And that gives us two times 10 to the fourth kilocalories per mole given off

334
00:21:26.921 --> 00:21:31.030
when that happens.
Okay.
Now that is our old familiar friend.

335
00:21:31.060 --> 00:21:34.120
What do you notice about the ratio or these energies

336
00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.570
tend to the fifth,
right?

337
00:21:37.750 --> 00:21:41.470
So it's 10 to the fifth smaller like the ratio of my hair to the width of the

338
00:21:41.471 --> 00:21:44.860
room,
right?
So much,
much smaller,
uh,

339
00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.150
energy involved in putting electrons onto the end of the one s shell of carbon

340
00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:52.390
than in putting the carbon nucleus together.
Okay?

341
00:21:53.050 --> 00:21:57.310
Then we're going to put the vet four valence electrons onto carbon,
right?

342
00:21:57.311 --> 00:21:58.600
The two s and two p.

343
00:21:59.110 --> 00:22:03.310
And with that we get another three times 10 to the third.

344
00:22:03.311 --> 00:22:08.050
So it's an order of magnitude less that one s electrons are bound much more

345
00:22:08.051 --> 00:22:12.220
strongly than the two s and two p.
And you know that from this scaling,
right?

346
00:22:12.221 --> 00:22:16.090
Z squared over,
over,
uh,
over end squared.

347
00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:21.760
Okay?
Cause you could use z effective to guess how the one S is,

348
00:22:21.761 --> 00:22:25.330
they're affecting the energies that the nuclear charge for the two s's.

349
00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.980
So you could lower the nuclear charge from six to four because they're already

350
00:22:29.981 --> 00:22:34.270
two electrons way down in there.
And then you have that end squared as well.

351
00:22:34.330 --> 00:22:37.300
So you could scale the energy and find that it's an order of magnitude less.

352
00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.630
Okay.
So then what are we going to do next?
Now that we have,

353
00:22:43.631 --> 00:22:48.580
Adam's
going to put them together to make bonds.
Okay,

354
00:22:48.670 --> 00:22:51.940
so we make four single bonds from carbon,

355
00:22:52.090 --> 00:22:55.180
but there to other carbons.
So for this one,
carbon,

356
00:22:55.181 --> 00:22:57.490
we should count only half of each energy,
right?

357
00:22:57.491 --> 00:23:01.750
Because half of it will assign to the other carbon.
So half of four single bonds,

358
00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:05.740
a single bond is order of magnitude 100 kilocalories per mole.

359
00:23:06.070 --> 00:23:08.440
So that's about 200 kilocalories per mole.

360
00:23:08.441 --> 00:23:13.180
So another order of magnitude down the energy and making bonds.
Okay.

361
00:23:13.390 --> 00:23:16.210
And then we can have non bonded contacts.

362
00:23:16.211 --> 00:23:20.890
Now there are different kinds of non bonded interactions between molecules and,

363
00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:24.820
but typically they're in the rain to be worth talking about there in the range

364
00:23:24.821 --> 00:23:27.400
of one to 20 kilocalories per mole.

365
00:23:27.430 --> 00:23:30.520
So another order of magnitude down or more.

366
00:23:32.250 --> 00:23:32.951
Uh,
okay.

367
00:23:32.951 --> 00:23:37.951
And the weakest of all the weakest bond known or interaction known attractive

368
00:23:38.201 --> 00:23:42.940
interaction is between two helium atoms.
It turns out that two helium atoms,

369
00:23:42.941 --> 00:23:45.890
although they don't form a bond,
are attractive.
You know,

370
00:23:45.891 --> 00:23:48.860
things that long distance or attractive and then they become repulsive.

371
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:53.270
So the minimum energy distance is 52 on strums,

372
00:23:53.900 --> 00:23:57.530
right?
30 some times as long as a normal bond.

373
00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:00.590
And the depth of that,
well,
how energy,

374
00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:05.620
how favorable is that energy is two times 10 to the minus sixth kilocalories per

375
00:24:06.141 --> 00:24:07.340
mole.
So that's nothing.

376
00:24:07.820 --> 00:24:12.820
But all these things we're looking at down below here are all based on cool ohms

377
00:24:13.311 --> 00:24:15.950
law.
The first one was not right.

378
00:24:15.951 --> 00:24:19.220
The nuclear binding energy is not cool ohms law,

379
00:24:19.221 --> 00:24:21.380
but all these others are cool ohms law.

380
00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.680
But they're all 10 to the fifth,

381
00:24:24.710 --> 00:24:29.710
up to 10 to the 15th times weaker than what goes on in the nucleus.

382
00:24:31.370 --> 00:24:36.370
And that means if you made any error at all in the energy of the nucleus,

383
00:24:38.930 --> 00:24:43.280
it would completely wipe out anything that had to do with cool ohms energy.

384
00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:46.910
Right?
How's it so much bigger?

385
00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.360
So an infinitesimal error in nuclear energy or change in nuclear energy during

386
00:24:53.121 --> 00:24:57.050
our reaction would completely wipe out everything that we're talking about.

387
00:24:57.830 --> 00:24:58.220
Right?

388
00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:03.220
So this sounds like we would really worry about it except so a a 0.01% change in

389
00:25:04.191 --> 00:25:07.700
nuclear energy would overwhelm everything.
Cool.
Ambig right?

390
00:25:08.030 --> 00:25:12.830
But fortunately nuclear energy doesn't care about chemistry.

391
00:25:12.890 --> 00:25:15.680
If you change from one arrangement of atoms to another,

392
00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:20.240
the nuclear energy doesn't change at all.
Right?

393
00:25:20.630 --> 00:25:21.980
So why is that good?

394
00:25:24.110 --> 00:25:24.580
<v 2>Okay.</v>

395
00:25:24.580 --> 00:25:26.230
<v 0>You can just cancel it out.</v>

396
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:31.150
Starting material and products of any reaction have exactly the same nuclear

397
00:25:31.151 --> 00:25:33.460
energy.
So if you're not a physicist,

398
00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:37.450
you can just forget nuclear energy even though it's so enormous.

399
00:25:38.550 --> 00:25:42.940
Okay.
Is that clear?
So forget nuclear energy.
We don't have to worry about it.

400
00:25:43.150 --> 00:25:47.320
All we have to worry about are these Coolum things now.
Uh,

401
00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:49.990
so black that out.
Okay.

402
00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.080
Now here's how big correlation energy is.

403
00:25:53.081 --> 00:25:56.260
It depends on what problem you're dealing with,
how big the molecule is,

404
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.540
what kind of items there are in the molecule.

405
00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:02.200
The error you make an SCF is different for different cases,

406
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.400
but for the kind of cases were interested in normal organic molecules.

407
00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:11.620
It's of the order of a hundred kilocalories per mole.
Now that's an error.

408
00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:17.660
Do you care about that error?
How big is that?

409
00:26:17.661 --> 00:26:21.520
The error in in nuclear energy and air or would have been enormous and

410
00:26:21.521 --> 00:26:24.400
completely wiped anything out.
Is this enormous?

411
00:26:25.940 --> 00:26:29.060
Do we care about an error of 100 kilocalories per mole?

412
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:32.643
<v 2>Dewey,</v>

413
00:26:33.490 --> 00:26:36.870
<v 0>would you care about a era of another?
Uh,</v>

414
00:26:39.730 --> 00:26:40.630
Devin?
What?
Nobody you saying?

415
00:26:41.050 --> 00:26:43.650
Would you care if you made an error of a hundred kilocalories?
Mole?

416
00:26:43.680 --> 00:26:46.080
How big is that in the scale of things we're talking about?

417
00:26:48.930 --> 00:26:52.730
Does this seem big compared to what?
That's the question.

418
00:26:55.050 --> 00:26:59.700
What are we interested in?
Bonds?
How big is it compared to bonds?

419
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.990
It's as big as a bond.
A bond is a hundred kilocalories per mole.

420
00:27:04.230 --> 00:27:07.920
That means that that we're designing.
That's disaster,
right?

421
00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:12.600
Unless what?
The nuclear would've been a disaster too.

422
00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:17.970
Why isn't it errors and nuclear energy or not a disaster?
Why?

423
00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:25.320
Because they don't change the starting material on their product have the same.

424
00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.420
So the same thing would be true here.

425
00:27:27.570 --> 00:27:32.130
If correlation energy didn't change from one arrangement of atoms to another

426
00:27:32.131 --> 00:27:33.720
arrangement of the same atoms,

427
00:27:34.170 --> 00:27:38.490
then it would just cancel out and he wouldn't care.
Everybody got that idea?

428
00:27:40.590 --> 00:27:45.270
Okay,
so the correlation energy is about equal to the magnitude of a bond.

429
00:27:45.630 --> 00:27:49.290
But how big are changes in correlation energy when you change?

430
00:27:49.291 --> 00:27:51.570
The arrangement of atoms will change,

431
00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:56.660
tend to be about 10 to 15% as big as bond energy or 10 to 15% as big as,

432
00:27:58.410 --> 00:28:02.340
as,
uh,
as correlation energy.
So correlation energy does change.

433
00:28:02.341 --> 00:28:06.300
You make different errors for different arrangements of the same Adams,

434
00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:11.070
but those errors are about 10 to 15% as big as a bond.
Now,

435
00:28:11.071 --> 00:28:13.410
do you care about correlation?

436
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:16.170
You don't care as much.

437
00:28:16.260 --> 00:28:20.810
So you'll get a proximate ideas if you don't care within.
If,
if you,

438
00:28:20.840 --> 00:28:25.650
if you're satisfied with getting about 80% of the right answer,
right,

439
00:28:25.950 --> 00:28:28.770
then you don't care,
okay?

440
00:28:30.030 --> 00:28:35.010
So that implies that orbital theory is fine as long as what you're interested in

441
00:28:35.011 --> 00:28:39.480
is answering qualitative rather than find quantitative questions.

442
00:28:40.050 --> 00:28:43.020
Okay?
So if you want to get numbers really right,

443
00:28:43.021 --> 00:28:45.960
and the magnitude of the number really makes a difference to you,

444
00:28:45.961 --> 00:28:50.700
a few percent change,
then you have to do something better than use orbitals.

445
00:28:51.150 --> 00:28:51.983
Okay?

446
00:28:51.990 --> 00:28:56.490
But if you just want to understand why bonds work than orbitals are fine.

447
00:28:57.540 --> 00:29:01.350
Okay?
Because the correlation changes in correlation energy aren't that big.

448
00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:06.390
So,
but for these properties,

449
00:29:06.391 --> 00:29:09.990
for non bonded contacts,
especially for helium,
helium,

450
00:29:10.440 --> 00:29:13.290
it's the correlation is the only game in town.

451
00:29:13.291 --> 00:29:16.200
Often that's what holds helium atoms together.

452
00:29:16.380 --> 00:29:21.060
Helium atoms are nuclei positively charged,
electrons negatively charged.

453
00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:25.710
So nucleus or repels nucleus,
electrons repel electrons.

454
00:29:25.860 --> 00:29:30.360
Nucleus attracts electrons.
Nucleus attracts electrons,
right?

455
00:29:30.630 --> 00:29:34.440
They at first at 53 on strums or 52 Austrians,
far apart,

456
00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:36.750
those essentially cancel,
right?

457
00:29:36.990 --> 00:29:41.990
But the motion of the electron around this nucleus correlates with the motion of

458
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:48.700
the electron around this nucleus.
They tend to be in phase with one another.

459
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:53.380
So at any given time,
you have plus,
minus,
plus minus,

460
00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.600
and they attract one another.

461
00:29:56.530 --> 00:30:01.530
So that precisely what holds helium to helium is correlation.

462
00:30:02.230 --> 00:30:06.700
So if what you're interested in is bonding,
then use orbitals fine.

463
00:30:07.450 --> 00:30:10.690
But if you're interested in non bonded interactions,

464
00:30:10.960 --> 00:30:15.730
then correlation can be a big problem.
Okay.
But we're talking about bonds now,

465
00:30:15.731 --> 00:30:19.030
not correlation.
Okay?

466
00:30:19.031 --> 00:30:23.440
So orbitals can't be true.
That's clear because electrons influence one another.

467
00:30:23.710 --> 00:30:26.830
They repel one another.
If you have more,
if you have just one electron,

468
00:30:26.831 --> 00:30:29.440
fine more electron orbitals can't be true.

469
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:34.680
But still we'll use them to understand bonding and structure and energy and

470
00:30:35.741 --> 00:30:36.551
reactivity.

471
00:30:36.551 --> 00:30:41.551
And we know that we won't get precise values will be off by by one to 10

472
00:30:42.461 --> 00:30:47.230
kilocalories per mole,
but we'll get insight.
That's very useful.

473
00:30:48.220 --> 00:30:52.060
Okay.
Now what gives atomic orbitals their shape.

474
00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:54.070
<v 2>Okay.</v>

475
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:58.210
<v 0>Why does this uh,
particular orbital have a node?</v>

476
00:30:58.870 --> 00:30:59.703
For example?

477
00:31:00.670 --> 00:31:04.480
We know coolamons law tends to attract the electrons to the nucleus.

478
00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.670
Why does it have a node and spread out?

479
00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.633
<v 2>Yeah,</v>

480
00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:15.010
<v 0>because of kinetic energy,
right?
This curvature of wave functions.</v>

481
00:31:15.011 --> 00:31:18.490
It's required to solve Schrodinger.
So its kinetic energy that gives,

482
00:31:18.491 --> 00:31:21.910
gives them their shape.
Or if you double the nuclear charge,

483
00:31:22.210 --> 00:31:26.740
the thing gets half as big.
That's cool.
Ohms law,
sucking it in,

484
00:31:27.340 --> 00:31:29.980
right?
So the potential energy scales,

485
00:31:30.370 --> 00:31:34.360
the radius through the formula for row.
We've seen that,

486
00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:37.540
but the kinetic energy is what creates nodes.

487
00:31:37.870 --> 00:31:42.870
So the two s has that spherical node or this orbital here has a conical to two

488
00:31:45.311 --> 00:31:48.580
cones and a spherical node.
It's the four d orbital.

489
00:31:48.910 --> 00:31:51.970
So kinetic energy is what creates the shapes.

490
00:31:52.510 --> 00:31:55.240
The charge just scales things in and out.

491
00:31:57.980 --> 00:31:59.750
Now if we use orbitals,

492
00:32:00.770 --> 00:32:04.670
how should we calculate the total electron density?
Well,

493
00:32:04.671 --> 00:32:07.130
we have two one electron wave functions.

494
00:32:07.131 --> 00:32:10.430
We know that the density of electron one at this position,

495
00:32:10.431 --> 00:32:12.200
by squaring its way function,

496
00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:16.670
we know the density of electron to at that position by squaring it's wave

497
00:32:16.671 --> 00:32:20.810
function.
How do we get the total electron density at that same position?

498
00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.410
How would you get it?
You know how much of electron one is there?

499
00:32:25.411 --> 00:32:30.270
It's probability density,
you know,
to how do you get the total Ilana?

500
00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.693
<v 2>Yeah.</v>

501
00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:37.830
<v 0>If you know how much of electron one is there and you know how much of electron</v>

502
00:32:37.831 --> 00:32:42.440
to is there,
how much of a total,
like how much total electron density is there,

503
00:32:42.441 --> 00:32:47.000
how would you get it?
Can't hear very well.
Yeah.

504
00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:50.510
Adam together,
the whole is the sum of its parts.
Okay,

505
00:32:50.511 --> 00:32:55.310
so the total density is the sum of those two squared wave functions.
The Stripe.

506
00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:59.090
But notice it's a sum.
It's not a product.

507
00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:01.640
This is not a question of joint probability.

508
00:33:01.641 --> 00:33:06.380
It's not what's the probability that electron one and electron to are there at

509
00:33:06.381 --> 00:33:08.600
the same time?
That's not the question.

510
00:33:09.050 --> 00:33:12.500
The question is what's the total probability of finding any electron in there?

511
00:33:13.070 --> 00:33:17.570
Okay,
so it's a sum.
It's not,
it's not a product.
Okay.

512
00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:21.530
Now we had this question you looked at before,
how lumpy is the nitrogen atom?

513
00:33:21.770 --> 00:33:26.240
This picture is taken from a recent organic text and they had fancy graphic

514
00:33:26.241 --> 00:33:30.260
program or artist or something that drew something.
It looks very realistic.

515
00:33:30.710 --> 00:33:30.981
Right?

516
00:33:30.981 --> 00:33:34.430
But we can check it cause we know the formulas and if we want to get the total

517
00:33:34.431 --> 00:33:35.600
electron density,

518
00:33:35.780 --> 00:33:40.640
we add the electron density of the electron that's in the px and the one that's

519
00:33:40.641 --> 00:33:42.790
in the p y and the one that's Pz orbital.

520
00:33:42.791 --> 00:33:46.370
So we square them and we get this and we sum it up to get the total electron

521
00:33:46.371 --> 00:33:47.120
density.

522
00:33:47.120 --> 00:33:51.770
And it's some constant times x squared plus y squared plus z squared times e to

523
00:33:51.771 --> 00:33:56.480
the minus row after we squared.
Right.
Uh,
and what,

524
00:33:56.510 --> 00:34:00.650
how can you simplify that?
What's x squared plus y squared plus c squared?

525
00:34:01.760 --> 00:34:04.430
It's r squared.
Okay.

526
00:34:04.790 --> 00:34:09.740
So how does it depend on theta?
How does it depend on fee?

527
00:34:09.860 --> 00:34:14.540
Elizabeth?
Does it depend?
What does it look like?
It's a sphere.

528
00:34:14.750 --> 00:34:18.590
It's a ball.
It doesn't look like this thing.
So it's spherical.

529
00:34:18.591 --> 00:34:21.740
So forget for all the elegance of that picture.
Forget it.

530
00:34:21.950 --> 00:34:25.880
They're not showing you the truth.
Okay.

531
00:34:25.881 --> 00:34:29.990
Or this problem we had before of looking at the cross section of the CN triple

532
00:34:29.991 --> 00:34:33.470
bond where we sliced it and turned it and thought it might look like a

533
00:34:33.471 --> 00:34:37.130
cloverleaf or maybe buy some kind of a diamond shape or something.

534
00:34:37.131 --> 00:34:39.230
But in fact it's round.
Why?

535
00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.040
Because two p x squared plus two p y squared,

536
00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:45.980
it depends on x squared plus y squared,

537
00:34:45.981 --> 00:34:50.620
which is r squared in two dimensions,
right?
So it's cylindrical doesn't,

538
00:34:50.660 --> 00:34:53.990
doesn't depend on the angle around the bond axis.

539
00:34:55.940 --> 00:34:59.810
Okay?
So this is what we've seen and we've seen a three dimensional reality.

540
00:34:59.811 --> 00:35:03.010
Hydrogen like Adams,
we talked about hybridization.
Uh,

541
00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:05.420
we saw the orbitals are fundamentally wrong,

542
00:35:05.421 --> 00:35:10.421
but that we can recover from the orbital prop approximation and use it if we,

543
00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:14.060
uh,
for example with self-consistent field,

544
00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:17.630
as long as we're not interested in getting the very finest energy,

545
00:35:17.631 --> 00:35:20.720
but our can be satisfied with approximation.

546
00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:24.290
Now we're going to move on to something more interesting,
which is molecules.

547
00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:27.320
We're going to look first at plum pudding,
molecular orbitals,

548
00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.480
and then understanding bonds and overlap and energy match.

549
00:35:32.481 --> 00:35:37.040
Now,
there are lots of different ways of looking at the electron distribution you

550
00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:38.071
this story,

551
00:35:38.071 --> 00:35:43.071
presumably about different blind men doing experiments on an elephant and

552
00:35:43.321 --> 00:35:44.850
getting completely different ideas.

553
00:35:44.851 --> 00:35:47.520
The same is true of the electrons in a molecule.

554
00:35:47.820 --> 00:35:52.080
So here's the electron density in a hydrogen molecule.
It's calculated,

555
00:35:52.260 --> 00:35:55.710
but there are ways to get that kind of information experimentally as well.

556
00:35:56.040 --> 00:36:00.360
So you know how contours work this a lot more dense near the,
the,
uh,

557
00:36:00.690 --> 00:36:05.300
origin near the,
near the nuclei.
So,
uh,

558
00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:09.660
which contour do we want to look at in order to understand it?
Well,

559
00:36:09.661 --> 00:36:14.430
we can choose our contour and we get different pictures,
different understanding,

560
00:36:14.431 --> 00:36:18.240
depending on which contour we choose.
For example,

561
00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:23.340
we could choose way down very high electron density,
right?

562
00:36:23.640 --> 00:36:28.350
And then we see just the set of two Adams.
It just looks like two atoms,

563
00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:32.400
right?
We don't see the fact that it's a molecule.
Where have we done this before,

564
00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:37.443
<v 2>Andrew?</v>

565
00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:45.850
<v 0>Pardon me?
Not Different density.
Yeah,</v>

566
00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:50.170
total electronic.
We looked at total electron density.
It just looked like Adams.

567
00:36:50.171 --> 00:36:53.440
We had to do the difference in order to see that it was not just Adams,

568
00:36:53.441 --> 00:36:56.590
it was essentially just Adams.
So if you look at high density,

569
00:36:56.591 --> 00:36:59.470
you see just a set of Adam's,
nope,
no excitement there.

570
00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:04.150
So that's the molecule as a set of Adam's just to set of Adams.

571
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:05.740
Okay.

572
00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:10.570
Or we could take a somewhat lower electron density contour and we'd see that the

573
00:37:10.571 --> 00:37:12.280
atoms are a little bit distorted.

574
00:37:12.490 --> 00:37:15.580
Or we could do a difference map is shy says in order to see that they're a

575
00:37:15.581 --> 00:37:20.080
little bit distorted because of bonding distorts the shape of the atoms a little

576
00:37:20.081 --> 00:37:24.580
bit.
But another,
but first,
and this is what we're going to look at shortly,

577
00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:30.000
but first I want to get some insight by looking at the very lowest electron

578
00:37:31.061 --> 00:37:31.460
dense.

579
00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:36.460
So that would be molecules formed from a set of Adam's rather than as a set of

580
00:37:36.851 --> 00:37:39.160
Adam's right there.
Little changes because of the bonds.

581
00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:42.190
But how about if we look way out there now,

582
00:37:42.191 --> 00:37:45.940
if you don't look a really close,
it looks spherical.

583
00:37:45.941 --> 00:37:49.120
It looks just like an Adam or almost like an Adam.

584
00:37:49.121 --> 00:37:50.380
And if you want to even further out,

585
00:37:50.381 --> 00:37:55.000
it would get spherical for all you could tell.
Okay,
so that would be,

586
00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:59.170
that's the molecule looking like an Adam with whatever number of electrons the

587
00:37:59.171 --> 00:38:00.130
molecule has.

588
00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:06.640
So that's the molecule as one Adam.
The only difference is that the nucleus,

589
00:38:06.641 --> 00:38:08.380
which for an Adam would be in the middle,

590
00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:11.770
has been split to give two nuclei,

591
00:38:12.220 --> 00:38:17.110
which of course distorts the shape of the electrons a little bit if you move the

592
00:38:17.170 --> 00:38:19.210
cut the nucleus into and split it out.

593
00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:24.400
So we want to look at a few molecules from this point of view as single Adams

594
00:38:24.401 --> 00:38:26.200
because we know about Adam's now,

595
00:38:26.500 --> 00:38:30.250
but distorted by the fact that the nuclei has been split apart.

596
00:38:30.850 --> 00:38:35.850
So this is nuclei embedded in a cloud of now what gave those electrons,

597
00:38:37.811 --> 00:38:42.811
they're shape the shape of the cloud in which this thing is embedded.

598
00:38:43.030 --> 00:38:47.470
What gave them their shape?
We just talked about this short time ago.

599
00:38:47.950 --> 00:38:49.720
What gives orbitals they're shaped data

600
00:38:51.490 --> 00:38:56.230
to be as far apart as possible.
That's potential energy,
right?

601
00:38:56.410 --> 00:38:59.800
But that's not what gives,
that's not what creates nodes,
right?

602
00:38:59.801 --> 00:39:01.450
That just causes things to spread out.

603
00:39:01.630 --> 00:39:05.190
What gives them their characteristic shape of nodes?
Planar nodes,

604
00:39:05.191 --> 00:39:06.700
spherical nodes,
and so on,
Elizabeth,

605
00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:11.890
it's the kinetic energy and the same kinetic energy considerations will apply in

606
00:39:11.891 --> 00:39:13.720
a molecule as in anatomy.

607
00:39:13.721 --> 00:39:16.540
It's always curvature of the wave function divided by the wave function.

608
00:39:16.990 --> 00:39:17.823
So there,

609
00:39:17.890 --> 00:39:22.890
so the electrons are dispersed by electron repulsion and noted given nodes by

610
00:39:24.071 --> 00:39:24.940
the kinetic energy.

611
00:39:24.941 --> 00:39:29.200
And the kinetic energy also causes them to spread out as we've seen before.

612
00:39:30.520 --> 00:39:35.350
Okay.
But you see them that although Thompson was wrong about the Adam,

613
00:39:35.351 --> 00:39:40.351
it wasn't a plum pudding of Nuclei embedded in a cloud of positive charge.

614
00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:43.570
But a molecule is a plum pudding.

615
00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:48.630
It's nuclei embedded in a cloud of negative charge.

616
00:39:49.150 --> 00:39:54.150
But that cloud of negative charge is given its form by kinetic energy,

617
00:39:54.281 --> 00:39:57.610
largely also potential energy as you say.

618
00:39:58.330 --> 00:40:02.530
So it's backwards from what Thompson thought.
But his idea,
it wasn't a silly one.

619
00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:06.430
It just happened to be wrong for Adams.

620
00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:11.200
So here's a piece of plum pudding in which you know is like fruit cake.

621
00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:15.850
So how do the plums distort the pudding,

622
00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:21.670
right?
We know that.
We know what what Adams would look like now,

623
00:40:22.150 --> 00:40:22.750
right?

624
00:40:22.750 --> 00:40:26.830
But if you split the nucleus into several nuclei and move them around as the

625
00:40:26.831 --> 00:40:30.370
plums in the pudding,
they'll change the shape of the electrons.
How?

626
00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:33.940
That's what we want to look at today.
Okay.

627
00:40:33.941 --> 00:40:38.770
So first we're going to look at methane and ammonia and we want to understand

628
00:40:38.771 --> 00:40:41.320
them visually.
Why do they have the,

629
00:40:41.380 --> 00:40:45.280
why do the orbitals in these molecules have the shapes?
They do?

630
00:40:45.970 --> 00:40:49.510
Okay,
so there are four pairs of Valence electrons.

631
00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:52.180
There are also two core electrons,

632
00:40:52.181 --> 00:40:55.000
one s electrons on carbon and on nitrogen.

633
00:40:55.840 --> 00:41:00.550
So we want to compare the molecular orbitals to the atomic orbitals of Neon,

634
00:41:00.670 --> 00:41:05.670
which has the same number of electrons for electron pairs within equals two in

635
00:41:06.071 --> 00:41:08.770
the neon atoms.
So there's the same number of electrons is neon.

636
00:41:09.010 --> 00:41:13.020
So they should add a big distance.
If you look at very low contours,

637
00:41:13.030 --> 00:41:16.540
it should look like a neon Adam.
But what does it look like as you get closer?

638
00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:21.610
Okay,
so here's a one s orbital of the Neon Adam,
right?

639
00:41:21.910 --> 00:41:24.130
And here's the one s orbital of methane.

640
00:41:24.430 --> 00:41:27.730
It's that net that shown the red net.
Everybody see it?

641
00:41:28.750 --> 00:41:32.860
And here's the contour level that we're drawing is where the,

642
00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:35.510
we know which level are we choosing.

643
00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.580
We're choosing 0.01 electrons per cubic [inaudible] is the level we've chosen to

644
00:41:40.581 --> 00:41:44.870
draw of the onion,
right?
And here it is for nitrogen.

645
00:41:44.871 --> 00:41:48.740
The blue when there is is the lowest molecular orbital,

646
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:54.350
but they're just little spheres right there,
like the one s of of uh,

647
00:41:55.070 --> 00:41:59.300
uh,
of,
of a neon.
Okay.

648
00:41:59.301 --> 00:42:04.301
So the core orbitals are like the one s of the carbon or nitrogen atom there are

649
00:42:05.151 --> 00:42:06.170
tightly held.

650
00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:10.730
They aren't distorted very much because the nuclei have split apart,

651
00:42:11.270 --> 00:42:15.170
right?
And they're boring.
So forget them.

652
00:42:15.171 --> 00:42:16.790
We won't talk about them anymore.

653
00:42:18.350 --> 00:42:22.040
We'll focus on the valence orbital swear.
The bonding action will occur.

654
00:42:23.300 --> 00:42:27.890
Now they're eight valence electrons.
That means to them orbital.

655
00:42:28.220 --> 00:42:31.510
So there'll be four molecular orbitals that have electron,

656
00:42:31.511 --> 00:42:36.350
send them in methane and they,
they are arranged in energy this way.
There are,

657
00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:39.710
there's a lowest energy and then there are three that have exactly the same

658
00:42:39.711 --> 00:42:41.180
energy.
Do you remember what those are?

659
00:42:41.181 --> 00:42:46.100
What we call those when several orbitals have the same energy degenerate.
Okay?

660
00:42:46.740 --> 00:42:50.750
So there are three degenerate molecular orbitals for ch four that have exactly

661
00:42:50.751 --> 00:42:53.990
the same energy.
In the case of ammonia,
it's a little different.

662
00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:58.940
There's one lowest one and then there are,
uh,
there are three,

663
00:42:58.941 --> 00:43:00.830
but one of them is higher than the other two.

664
00:43:00.831 --> 00:43:03.440
They're only to degenerate ones there,
incidentally.

665
00:43:03.590 --> 00:43:07.700
What does that remind you have to have one that's a little bit lower and then

666
00:43:07.701 --> 00:43:10.310
three that are the same energy.
Have you ever seen that before?

667
00:43:15.290 --> 00:43:19.670
Ah,
two s and two P,
right?
There's one,
two s and three two peas in an atom,

668
00:43:20.630 --> 00:43:24.560
right here is a molecule and there's one that's lower and then three that are

669
00:43:24.561 --> 00:43:25.790
equivalent.
Okay?

670
00:43:25.791 --> 00:43:29.600
Now there's the lowest one and it's a two s orbital.

671
00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:34.790
It's the analog,
it's the night the,
the neons two s orbital.

672
00:43:34.880 --> 00:43:39.880
That's been distorted by taking four protons out of the nucleus and pulling them

673
00:43:41.181 --> 00:43:44.270
out to be where the hydrogens are.
Okay?

674
00:43:44.660 --> 00:43:49.280
So you can see how this has been distorted by distorting the electron cloud into

675
00:43:49.281 --> 00:43:52.730
the direction where the protons had been pulled out.
You see that,

676
00:43:54.230 --> 00:43:58.010
okay,
now you don't see that you have to remove the ball there.

677
00:43:58.011 --> 00:44:02.090
That's the carbon or the nitrogen to see that little spherical node.

678
00:44:02.091 --> 00:44:05.870
It's way down near the origin that made it a two s orbital,
right?

679
00:44:05.871 --> 00:44:09.590
That's the spherical node and it doesn't look like a sphere because of the

680
00:44:09.591 --> 00:44:14.060
algorithm the computer uses to draw this connecting dots with straight lines,

681
00:44:14.480 --> 00:44:16.310
right?
But it is more or less spherical,

682
00:44:16.311 --> 00:44:19.940
a little bit distorted by the fact that you've pulled these things out.
Okay?

683
00:44:19.941 --> 00:44:23.300
Now what do these molecular,
these are molecular orbitals,

684
00:44:23.720 --> 00:44:28.010
but that you see is a two p x orbital.
That's been a little bit distorted,

685
00:44:29.210 --> 00:44:34.080
right?
Notice that,
that the difference between the ch four in the Nh three,

686
00:44:34.081 --> 00:44:38.640
there was a proton that went up and ch four,
right?
Which pulled the,

687
00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.090
which can come up,
pull them up.
But if you didn't have that,

688
00:44:42.150 --> 00:44:45.090
it didn't go up as high,
right?
But then it's essentially,

689
00:44:45.091 --> 00:44:50.091
this is the two px orbital of the molecule distorted from the Adam by pulling

690
00:44:50.281 --> 00:44:54.270
protons out of the nucleus.
Okay?
Or that one.
What's that one?

691
00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.080
It's two P y.
But you have to rotate it to see it.

692
00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.620
If we rotate it 90 degrees here,
you can see that it's two p.

693
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:06.600
Why orbital and again the the ch four is distorted that the top because two

694
00:45:06.601 --> 00:45:11.130
protons came out and stretched it out.
Same thing in nitrogen.

695
00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:16.260
Now we go to the,
to the third of these two P orbitals,

696
00:45:16.350 --> 00:45:20.310
which is different in nitrogen for the nitrogen case.
Higher an energy.

697
00:45:20.311 --> 00:45:21.144
There they are.

698
00:45:21.270 --> 00:45:26.270
Why is that orbital higher in energy than the others in nitrogen?

699
00:45:26.491 --> 00:45:27.720
Why isn't it so good?

700
00:45:28.560 --> 00:45:33.360
Because you have electrons up in that red region that don't have a proton there.

701
00:45:33.540 --> 00:45:38.540
It's not being stabilized here that the electron density that went up is,

702
00:45:39.070 --> 00:45:43.560
is around a proton.
They're the top lobe of the p orbital,

703
00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.130
right?
Doesn't have a proton stabilizing it,
so it's,
it's,

704
00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.080
it's higher in energy and turns out to be more reactive.
What do you call it?

705
00:45:55.410 --> 00:45:57.270
That's the unshared pair.

706
00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.580
The high energy reactive electrons are the ones that don't have a proton

707
00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:02.760
stabilizing up there.

708
00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.280
Now there are also vacant orbitals,
right?
Remember it?

709
00:46:08.310 --> 00:46:10.080
You can have any number of orbitals.

710
00:46:11.070 --> 00:46:15.570
We're looking at the ones that you can make from the two s and two p.

711
00:46:15.780 --> 00:46:19.960
But we have to add that we have,
uh,
we have,
uh,

712
00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:24.330
a number of,
of,
uh,
of atomic orbitals that we can use.

713
00:46:24.331 --> 00:46:26.040
We're looking at the lowest set,

714
00:46:26.041 --> 00:46:31.041
the ones that come just from one s orbitals of hydrogen and two s and two p

715
00:46:31.261 --> 00:46:36.150
orbitals of carbon or nitrogen.
But there are eight such orbitals,

716
00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.010
four two s and three two p's on the central atom for,

717
00:46:41.011 --> 00:46:43.920
on the hydrogen for ch four.

718
00:46:44.310 --> 00:46:48.900
So there'll be a number of other combinations you can make from mixing those,

719
00:46:49.590 --> 00:46:52.980
uh,
which won't have electrons to go in.
And,
but let's look at them.

720
00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:58.220
So here are the next four orbitals made from the valence level orbitals of the

721
00:46:58.351 --> 00:46:59.670
Adams involved.

722
00:47:00.030 --> 00:47:03.870
So what you see on ch four that this is the three s orbital.

723
00:47:03.871 --> 00:47:07.310
It has a radial node,
right?
There's our,
pardon me,
yeah.

724
00:47:07.350 --> 00:47:10.680
Radio or spherical node here that surrounds here.

725
00:47:10.681 --> 00:47:14.400
So it's red sign inside blue sign outside.

726
00:47:14.610 --> 00:47:17.520
The same thing is true on the,
of the Nh three,

727
00:47:17.730 --> 00:47:21.150
but you have to rotate in order to see it.
Uh,

728
00:47:21.330 --> 00:47:25.920
that's the lowest vacant,
the lowest unoccupied molecular orbital.

729
00:47:26.250 --> 00:47:29.160
And if we,
uh,
if we rotate it here,

730
00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.220
you can see the inner part and bear in mind that there are two spherical nodes.

731
00:47:35.561 --> 00:47:39.670
There's one that's really tiny that's inside anything we can see here.

732
00:47:41.470 --> 00:47:43.840
Okay?
Then there's this orbital,

733
00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:48.340
which is the three d x squared minus y squared looked at from a funny angle

734
00:47:48.341 --> 00:47:49.840
where it's not very clear what it is,

735
00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:53.080
but if we rotate all of these by 90 degrees,

736
00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:57.820
you can see that it's like that,
that uh,

737
00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:02.440
that cross or whatever you call it,
of the three d x squared minus y squared.

738
00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.980
But why doesn't it look just like that?
Why are they distorted?

739
00:48:06.730 --> 00:48:10.660
Why does it have this funny u shape here instead of this lobe,

740
00:48:10.661 --> 00:48:15.430
this lobe here and here?
The lobes moved up there.
Why

741
00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:20.980
Angela?
Pardon me?
That's where the protons pulled them.

742
00:48:21.130 --> 00:48:22.270
The potential energy,

743
00:48:22.480 --> 00:48:27.130
but the fundamental shape before it got distorted by the potential energy of

744
00:48:27.131 --> 00:48:31.570
where the protons are.
The fundamental shape was from the kinetic energy.

745
00:48:31.571 --> 00:48:34.060
It was like the three d x squared minus y squared.

746
00:48:34.300 --> 00:48:36.640
Or how about this one there you can see,

747
00:48:36.641 --> 00:48:41.440
but it's clearer still if we rotate it that again,
it's that,
uh,
that,

748
00:48:41.441 --> 00:48:43.180
uh,
x shape thing,

749
00:48:43.210 --> 00:48:48.210
but the ones on top of been pulled out by the protons or this one,

750
00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:51.100
that's the one that has a doughnut around the middle,

751
00:48:51.760 --> 00:48:56.460
but the donut has been pulled down by,
by the three hydrogens,
uh,
that,

752
00:48:56.650 --> 00:49:00.470
that aren't on the exit on the z axis or here.

753
00:49:00.730 --> 00:49:04.480
There it is rotated.
Okay.
Now,
um,

754
00:49:05.320 --> 00:49:06.440
I hoped to get let,

755
00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.400
let's just start FAA and methanol and then we can get to a better,

756
00:49:09.430 --> 00:49:13.420
more interesting things in it next time.
It has a lot more pairs of electrons,

757
00:49:13.421 --> 00:49:18.340
ethane,
and Methadone.
So we can compare those ammos to the Aos of Argon,

758
00:49:18.380 --> 00:49:21.640
which has the same number of electron pairs.
Uh,

759
00:49:22.180 --> 00:49:25.030
actually I should quit now and let you get to your next appointment.
