00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:04.900
We often look up to stars and feel at peace,
but stars are actually insanely turbulent

00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:06.720
and chaotic celestial things.

00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.039
And we use that chaos to learn more about
how our universe works.

00:00:10.039 --> 00:00:12.539
We’ve seen stars eat other stars,

00:00:12.539 --> 00:00:14.259
witnessed stellar flares,

00:00:14.259 --> 00:00:16.930
and white dwarves on the verge of a supernova.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:22.300
BUT... we haven't fully grasped what’s actually
going on inside the core of a star.

00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.180
Observing the interior of a star is pretty
much impossible at the moment…

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:30.070
so, scientists are looking at a phenomenon
happening on the surface of stars to better

00:00:30.070 --> 00:00:34.250
understand their internal structure: starquakes.

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:38.610
Similar to earthquakes here on our planet,
starquakes are tremors or waves that occur

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:41.960
on neutron stars and other massive bodies.

00:00:41.960 --> 00:00:44.040
Most stars are balls of plasma, but

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:49.621
neutron stars are super dense so they have
a crust -- neutron star crusts are 10 billion

00:00:49.621 --> 00:00:55.640
times stronger than steel.

00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:59.930
So when a star rotates quickly, the crust
is under pressure from gravity and that fast

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:02.340
rotation, causing it to bulge out.

00:01:02.340 --> 00:01:07.630
If the structure keeps twisting, it can rip
the crust open, and that creates a starquake.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:12.870
The resulting release of energy is vast beyond
our wildest imaginations.

00:01:12.870 --> 00:01:16.370
Starquakes are a reminder that space is violent
and metal as hell.

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:21.070
The biggest starquake ever detected was from
a magnetar -- which is such a bad ass name.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:25.780
They’re a class of neutron star with the
most intense magnetic fields in the entire

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:26.780
universe.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220
One starquake on a magnetar released more
energy in a tenth of a second than our sun

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:34.100
does in 150,000 years.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.310
That’s a metric [bleep] ton of energy.

00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:41.010
If the explosion had been within 10 light
years of us, experts say Earth could have

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:43.000
suffered a mass extinction.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.120
Phew.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:48.590
Another cool thing, those starquakes emit
frequencies that were detected by the Kepler

00:01:48.590 --> 00:01:57.990
Space Telescope and scientists interpreted
them for our ears.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:02.110
The reason astronomers looked into this, is
because some cosmologists believed stars were

00:02:02.110 --> 00:02:05.300
just out there… not really organized.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.980
Starquakes were used to prove otherwise.

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.450
In a recent paper, An international team of
astronomers studied starquakes from 48 red

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.020
giants in two ancient star clusters.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:19.110
And by measuring the waves from these starquakes,
they found 70% of the stars had spins that

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.870
were aligned with one another.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:26.950
It proved asteroseismology can be a successful
tool to understand the conditions of stars,

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.730
and discredited these theories that stars
were randomly oriented.

00:02:30.730 --> 00:02:34.870
Studying the vibrations from stars is very
similar to what seismologists do to understand

00:02:34.870 --> 00:02:36.260
the core of our own planet.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.260
For example, if you want to study the Earth’s
interior, we can’t just drill a hole into

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:44.010
the center and find out what’s going on.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.200
Same thing goes with stars.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:48.650
We can’t go in and grab a piece of a star’s
center and study it.

00:02:48.650 --> 00:02:51.570
But, the waves created by those quakes can
be measured.

00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.920
And by measuring the oscillations coming to
and from the center of the star, we can understand

00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.319
it's physical conditions, the size of its
center, and more about its origin story.

00:03:00.319 --> 00:03:05.599
It’s pretty wild that we can use the internal
hum of stars that are light years away to

00:03:05.599 --> 00:03:08.819
figure out how our universe formed billions
of years ago!

00:03:08.819 --> 00:03:11.129
More research is happily needed!

00:03:11.129 --> 00:03:15.900
So next time you look up to the stars, remember
you've actually got front row seats to a celestial

00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:19.310
Magnetar concert.

00:03:19.310 --> 00:03:22.150
By the way, did you know that stars are also
related?

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:26.099
Scientists found the family tree of our sun
and it turns out, it's got siblings.

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:27.659
Check out the fam here.

00:03:27.659 --> 00:03:28.659
