STEVEN HALL: The first
problem is right here.

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:21.310
I'm going to give you
a chance to practice

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:24.730
doing a proportional
derivative controller.

00:00:24.730 --> 00:00:27.580
And I've actually written
the specifications directly

00:00:27.580 --> 00:00:30.740
in terms of phase margin
and crossover frequency.

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.439
So you can either
imagine that that's

00:00:32.439 --> 00:00:34.960
the way the
specifications are given

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:38.560
or that we started with a
rise time and peak overshoot

00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:40.090
and derived these.

00:00:40.090 --> 00:00:43.540
So your goal is to
design a k of s that

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.450
meets these specifications.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:50.020
So if everyone could please,
form up in groups of two

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:51.830
around the room as usual.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:54.400
I'm Steve Hall,
I'm the instructor

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:58.600
of 1606, which is Principles
of Automatic Control.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:01.660
It's a junior level
classical control

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:04.629
class, which I've been
teaching for about six years.

00:01:04.629 --> 00:01:08.230
So recitations in 1606 are
a little different than most

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:10.090
recitations at MIT.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:12.610
In most recitations,
the instructor

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:18.040
would present a series
of problems maybe related

00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.030
to the homework, just
to give examples of how

00:01:22.030 --> 00:01:23.620
the problem should be worked.

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:27.270
Sometimes they might have
students try some themselves.

00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:29.290
In my recitations,
it's much more active.

00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:35.540
Students are always standing
up, we work at the board,

00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.120
usually in groups of two.

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:41.500
So there might be
10 groups of two

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.900
spread around the
room, each group of two

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:45.260
working at a board.

00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:50.140
A blackboard, a whiteboard,
could be a poster board.

00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:53.280
They're working
problems and the TA

00:01:53.280 --> 00:01:56.830
and I are walking around
and helping when we can,

00:01:56.830 --> 00:01:58.690
answering questions
when students

00:01:58.690 --> 00:02:01.030
have them, and
generally just coaching,

00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:03.790
trying to help the students
understand what they're doing

00:02:03.790 --> 00:02:04.780
and solve the problems.

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:06.670
It really is a
chance for students

00:02:06.670 --> 00:02:10.139
to understand what they know
and what they don't know

00:02:10.139 --> 00:02:13.117
and to exercise the skills that
they've learned in the class.

00:02:13.117 --> 00:02:14.950
And if they have problems
with those skills,

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.840
it's a chance for me to
help them learn them better.
