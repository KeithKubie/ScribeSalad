00:00:02.402 --> 00:00:05.405
- FUR SURE.

00:00:05.439 --> 00:00:08.141
- HO-HO!
LOOKIN' STRAIGHT GRIZZLY.

00:00:08.175 --> 00:00:10.010
- BITCH BETTER HAVE MY HONEY!

00:00:10.043 --> 00:00:12.546
- OH. OOH. BEAR PUNS.
I LIKE THOSE.

00:00:12.579 --> 00:00:14.414
- DUDE, I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SPENT YOUR ENTIRE PAYCHECK

00:00:14.448 --> 00:00:16.016
ON THAT JACKET.

00:00:16.049 --> 00:00:17.584
- WELL, I DIDN'T SPEND
MY ENTIRE PAYCHECK.

00:00:17.618 --> 00:00:19.853
I MADE $350 AND CARL GAVE ME
A DEAL ON THE COAT.

00:00:19.887 --> 00:00:21.989
$345.
- THAT'S GOOD.

00:00:22.022 --> 00:00:24.558
THAT'S A GOOD DEAL.
- SO YOU SAVED FIVE BUCKS.

00:00:24.591 --> 00:00:25.893
WAY TO GO.

00:00:25.926 --> 00:00:27.094
- WELL, I INVESTED MY SAVINGS

00:00:27.127 --> 00:00:29.429
IN A LITTLE BOTTLE OF IPECAC.

00:00:29.463 --> 00:00:31.064
IT'S THE STUFF
THAT MAKES YOU BARF.

00:00:31.098 --> 00:00:32.599
- SMART MOVE.

00:00:32.633 --> 00:00:34.168
- BASICALLY
A GET-OUT-OF-WORK-FREE PASS.

00:00:34.201 --> 00:00:35.769
- YEAH, IT MAKES YOU BARF,
DUDE.

00:00:35.802 --> 00:00:37.337
'CAUSE NOTHING MAKES ME BARF.
IT'S WEIRD.

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.605
I'VE GOT A STOMACH OF STEEL.

00:00:38.639 --> 00:00:40.607
- ADAM, SCIENTISTS
DEVELOPED THAT.

00:00:40.641 --> 00:00:42.342
IT WOULD MAKE YOU VOMIT.

00:00:42.376 --> 00:00:44.378
- BECAUSE SCIENTISTS MADE THIS.
- YEAH.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.879
- WHO BELIEVES
IN SCIENTISTS, DUDE?

00:00:45.913 --> 00:00:48.882
LET ME GIVE THIS
A LITTLE TESTEROO.

00:00:48.916 --> 00:00:50.617
HMM. THAT'S WEIRD.

00:00:50.651 --> 00:00:52.686
DEFINITELY DON'T FEEL
LIKE BARFING RIGHT NOW.

00:00:52.719 --> 00:00:54.421
OH, WAIT. UGH!
NO, I'M BARFING.

00:00:54.454 --> 00:00:56.857
UGH! I'M BARFING RIGHT NOW.
I'M NOT BARFING.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:58.292
- OKAY.
- WAIT I'M BARFING.

00:00:58.325 --> 00:00:59.927
UGH! I'M BARFING.

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:02.095
THOSE SCIENTISTS BETTER CHECK
THEIR HYPOTENUSES, DUDE.

00:01:02.129 --> 00:01:03.096 line:0%
 
OH, GOD.
