00:00:00.982 --> 00:00:01.940
(whooshing)

00:00:01.940 --> 00:00:04.860
- [Announcer] This program
is a presentation of UCTV

00:00:04.860 --> 00:00:07.983
for educational and
noncommercial use only.

00:00:10.901 --> 00:00:13.484
(upbeat music)

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:44.550
- Welcome, everyone.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:45.790
My name is Harry Scheiber.

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:47.720
I have the honor of being the chair

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.520
of the Jefferson Lectures Committee.

00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.036
We nominate speakers and
help to organize visits

00:00:58.036 --> 00:01:02.180
for this series which has
brought very distinguished people

00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:07.167
over the years and is our
campus's leading annual lecture

00:01:07.167 --> 00:01:09.440
in the social sciences.

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:11.980
These lectures were established in 1944

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:13.987
by a generous endowment
from Elizabeth Bonesteel

00:01:13.987 --> 00:01:17.210
and her husband, Cutler Bonesteel,

00:01:17.210 --> 00:01:21.810
a prominent San Francisco
couple who love this university

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:24.960
and wanted to provide
opportunities for the tradition,

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:28.290
the legacy of Thomas Jefferson

00:01:29.170 --> 00:01:33.130
and to have distinguished
scholars and politicians

00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:36.100
and journalists and other public figures

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.990
come to Berkeley to explore
the matter of the values

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.793
that are inherent in or that
challenge American democracy.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:47.680
The details of our speaker's
career are in the program

00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:51.210
and I don't want to take
more time than is needed,

00:01:51.210 --> 00:01:54.550
so I will just say a few
words about his reputation

00:01:54.550 --> 00:01:56.093
and his contributions.

00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:01.243
Roger Daniels, more than any
other individual at the time,

00:02:03.114 --> 00:02:06.925
took the history of Japanese
American internments

00:02:06.925 --> 00:02:08.490
in World War II

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.180
and explored them from
a scholarly standpoint

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.490
and with a candor and a devotion

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:21.490
and an ardor, passion,
that has been undiminished

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.990
for the nearly 50 years since then.

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:29.550
He's done other writings on
immigration history generally

00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:30.780
and on American history generally

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.640
and he's had a tremendous
influence as a mentor

00:02:33.640 --> 00:02:34.640
of graduate students,

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.720
as a mentor to younger scholars,

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.230
and as a colleague of people
of his own generation,

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.750
I include myself,

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:46.750
who have written, in my case
co-written, in that field

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:49.020
and who still have to look to him

00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:52.750
for authoritative judgments
on the issues of that

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.050
extraordinary episode, let
us hope it's extraordinary,

00:02:57.050 --> 00:02:59.363
episode in American history.

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:02.080
It's a very special pleasure

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:06.770
to welcome our speaker, the 19 ...

00:03:06.770 --> 00:03:08.413
I'm sorry, the 2010 ...

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:10.690
I'm an historian.

00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.542
(audience laughing)

00:03:12.542 --> 00:03:17.397
The 2010 Jefferson lecturer,
Professor Roger Daniels,

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.780
the Charles Phelps Taft Professor Emeritus

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:22.449
from the University of Cincinnati.

00:03:22.449 --> 00:03:25.616
(audience applauding)

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:28.993
- Thank you, Harry.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.433
What you're going to hear
is largely an oft told tale,

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:39.700
but it is a tale modified by being

00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.653
in post 9-11 America.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:49.693
What you see depends on where you stand.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.840
First it is in order to provide a reminder

00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:56.480
of what happened to Japanese Americans

00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:00.050
after the United States
was attacked by Japan

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.840
in December 1941

00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.230
and her allies Germany and Italy

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:07.813
declared war on the United States.

00:04:08.985 --> 00:04:12.130
There were more than a million nationals

00:04:12.130 --> 00:04:15.583
of the three main axis powers
living in the United States,

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.500
Hawaii and Alaska.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.600
Nearly 700,000 Italians

00:04:22.600 --> 00:04:25.220
and more than 300,000 Germans

00:04:25.220 --> 00:04:27.904
had chosen not to be naturalized,

00:04:27.904 --> 00:04:32.500
and about 90,000 foreign
born Japanese who,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:37.500
like most other Asians, were
ineligible for naturalization

00:04:38.020 --> 00:04:41.670
all became alien enemies.

00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:45.580
Those who were 14 years of age and upward

00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.483
were liable to internment.

00:04:48.378 --> 00:04:52.300
Clearly the government had no prewar plans

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.290
for mass incarceration

00:04:54.290 --> 00:04:59.000
nor any intention of rounding
up most alien enemies.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:02.860
Federal authorities eventually interned

00:05:04.477 --> 00:05:07.120
some 11,000 enemy aliens,

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.993
and the phrase Japanese American
internment is a misnomer.

00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:16.840
Internment can only be done to aliens,

00:05:16.840 --> 00:05:17.993
not to citizens.

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:23.540
Incarceration or some such
term is what has to be used

00:05:23.540 --> 00:05:25.210
if you want to be accurate

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.903
with the mass of Japanese Americans.

00:05:30.939 --> 00:05:34.410
Federal authorities eventually interned

00:05:34.410 --> 00:05:37.620
about 11,000 enemy aliens,

00:05:37.620 --> 00:05:40.090
about 1% of the total.

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:45.090
They took some 8,000
Japanese, 2,300 Germans,

00:05:45.150 --> 00:05:47.080
and a few hundred Italians.

00:05:47.080 --> 00:05:51.510
Although most proved no
threat to the United States,

00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.620
their confinement conformed to the statute

00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:00.620
and each was entitled to
a hearing without counsel

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:03.890
after imprisonment,

00:06:03.890 --> 00:06:07.480
and as a result of those
hearings some were released.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.230
In other words there was a
hint of due process in this.

00:06:11.130 --> 00:06:14.860
Internment of 8,000 Japanese
men and a few women,

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:19.390
one in 11 of the foreign
born ethnic population,

00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.640
included many community leaders

00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:26.380
and most Buddhist priests,
language school teachers,

00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:28.710
and was orderly and generally governed

00:06:28.710 --> 00:06:32.330
by the rules set forth
in the Geneva Convention.

00:06:32.330 --> 00:06:37.330
Initially federal authorities
carefully distinguished

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:40.310
between aliens and citizens,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.300
but as far as most
Americans were concerned

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:48.300
the 275,000 Americans
who looked like the enemy

00:06:49.385 --> 00:06:50.893
were the enemy,

00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:54.290
something reiterated by journalists,

00:06:54.290 --> 00:06:56.820
radio commentators and politicians.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:01.820
Some two-thirds of the 275,000
were birth right citizens.

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:04.950
The majority of Japanese Americans,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:09.610
some 150,000 lived in
the territory of Hawaii

00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:13.140
and were so vital to its functioning

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:15.760
as the focal point of the Pacific War

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:18.850
that a real military necessity required

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:22.470
that almost all of them,
regardless of citizenship,

00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:24.550
be left at liberty.

00:07:24.550 --> 00:07:28.590
Their wartime story will
not otherwise concern us

00:07:28.590 --> 00:07:32.910
this afternoon, although
it needs to be better known

00:07:32.910 --> 00:07:35.080
and for those of you who are interested,

00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:39.010
Harry Scheiber and Jane Scheiber
are telling part of that

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:42.160
story in a forthcoming work.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.640
Our chief concern is the 125,000 Japanese

00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.430
in the 48 states and Alaska.

00:07:49.430 --> 00:07:52.290
90,000 of them lived in California

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:56.020
with most of the rest in
coastal Washington and Oregon.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:58.370
They and the very few in Alaska

00:07:58.370 --> 00:08:00.470
and a small part of Arizona

00:08:00.470 --> 00:08:04.000
were eventually subjected
to mass incarceration.

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.220
The few thousand who
had lived in or fled to

00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:09.170
the rest of the United States

00:08:09.170 --> 00:08:11.630
lived throughout the rest of the war

00:08:11.630 --> 00:08:13.883
in a kind of nervous liberty.

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.800
But the West Coast Japanese Americans,

00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:22.630
men, women, children, and infants,

00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.680
were exiled from their
homes in the spring of 1942

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:29.810
in what we have learned
to call ethnic cleansing,

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:34.250
were temporarily warehoused
in unsanitary fairgrounds,

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:37.570
race tracks, and livestock
pavilions close to their homes

00:08:37.570 --> 00:08:40.140
for months before being shipped off

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:45.140
to 10 ramshackle purpose
built concentration camps

00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:47.520
in late summer or fall.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:50.350
These were in desolate
places where few people

00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:56.520
have ever lived before or since.

00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.260
This exodus has been
authoritatively described

00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:04.260
as caused by racism, war hysteria,

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:07.220
and a failure of political leadership.

00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:12.220
Factors, I must say, that
are still active and viral

00:09:12.760 --> 00:09:14.810
in our political life.

00:09:14.810 --> 00:09:16.570
But history is made by men and women

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.680
and we need to understand
who caused this disaster

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:21.193
of democracy and why.

00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:26.113
The perpetrator in chief was
Franklin Delano Roosevelt.

00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.830
On February 11th, Secretary
of War Henry L. Stimson,

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:33.930
who the night before,

00:09:33.930 --> 00:09:38.190
in other words the night
of February 10, 1942,

00:09:38.190 --> 00:09:41.467
had written in his diary the following.

00:09:41.467 --> 00:09:43.247
"The racial characteristics

00:09:43.247 --> 00:09:46.157
"of the second generation Japanese

00:09:46.157 --> 00:09:49.677
"are such that we cannot
understand or trust

00:09:49.677 --> 00:09:53.017
"even the citizen Japanese.

00:09:53.017 --> 00:09:56.817
"This latter is the fact,
but I am afraid it will make

00:09:56.817 --> 00:10:00.831
"a tremendous hole in
our constitutional system

00:10:00.831 --> 00:10:02.247
"to apply it."

00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.696
He telephoned Roosevelt to make that hole

00:10:08.696 --> 00:10:12.980
and asked for authority to
remove the Japanese Americans

00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:14.580
from the West Coast.

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:16.770
He reported to his key subordinate,

00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:19.360
Assistant Secretary of War John J. McCloy,

00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.930
that the president had
given him carte blanche

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:26.930
in dealing with the
Japanese on the West Coast,

00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:31.477
adding only, "Be as
reasonable as you can."

00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:38.383
Eight days later, February 19, 1942,

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.570
the real date of infamy
for constitutional liberty,

00:10:45.570 --> 00:10:50.570
the president signed
Executive Order number 9066,

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.230
which had been written
in the War Department

00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:55.630
to give the Army absolute power

00:10:55.630 --> 00:10:58.040
over the West Coast Japanese Americans,

00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:01.500
although neither they nor any other group

00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:03.400
is named in the order.

00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:05.453
Why did Roosevelt sign it?

00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.970
There is no definitive
answer to that question.

00:11:08.970 --> 00:11:12.830
The president never once
discussed his decision publicly,

00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.740
or as far as we know in private.

00:11:15.740 --> 00:11:18.170
It seems to me that his perception

00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:26.050
of political realities
and political advantage

00:11:26.050 --> 00:11:28.700
at a time when the war
was going very badly

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:30.470
for the United States,

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:34.570
and his greatest domestic
concern was national unity,

00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:39.570
was that such an action was expedient.

00:11:40.030 --> 00:11:43.540
A great clamor raised about the
dangers of Japanese American

00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:47.940
sabotage by journalists,
radio commentators,

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:50.500
politicians and professional patriots

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.500
had made it seem to be
the expedient thing to do

00:11:54.500 --> 00:11:58.070
and Roosevelt's reaction responded to it.

00:11:58.070 --> 00:12:01.700
No major act of his wartime presidency

00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:05.480
received greater approval from the public.

00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.200
Soon thereafter he was willing
to ameliorate his decision

00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.150
in certain ways.

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:13.350
When encouraged by educators,

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:15.360
including the president
of this university,

00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:16.990
Robert Gordon Sproul,

00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:19.560
as well as by some of his own aides,

00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.050
Roosevelt ordered in the spring of 1942

00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:26.437
that incarcerated students
might be released to attend

00:12:26.437 --> 00:12:30.020
colleges and universities
away from the West Coast,

00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.670
and in 1943, as part of
restoring the right of Nisei

00:12:34.670 --> 00:12:36.280
to enlist in the Army,

00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:39.887
he said that, "Americanism
is a matter of the mind

00:12:39.887 --> 00:12:41.407
"and of the heart.

00:12:41.407 --> 00:12:44.677
"Americanism is not and never was

00:12:44.677 --> 00:12:47.737
"a matter of race and ancestry."

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:54.570
Many young Nisei in
camp did in fact enlist.

00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:59.517
Others asked, "If that is the case,

00:12:59.517 --> 00:13:01.887
"why are we in concentration camps?"

00:13:02.800 --> 00:13:05.870
A year later the president
restored another right,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:07.800
the right to be drafted.

00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:11.080
Most of those called up for the draft

00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.984
while in concentration camps obeyed,

00:13:13.984 --> 00:13:17.290
but a significant minority resisted,

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:20.763
although they could neither flee nor hide.

00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:24.560
There is no time today
to go into the conditions

00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:25.683
of camp life.

00:13:26.530 --> 00:13:29.590
Except for the camp of Tule
Lake which became a place

00:13:29.590 --> 00:13:32.070
where the government sent troublemakers,

00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.960
the treatment was generally humane.

00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:38.420
The American concentration
camps were not death camps,

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:42.100
but on several occasions
incarcerated Japanese American

00:13:42.100 --> 00:13:45.810
protesters confronted
armed American soldiers,

00:13:45.810 --> 00:13:47.850
and as would happen later at Kent State

00:13:47.850 --> 00:13:49.620
and at some black colleges,

00:13:49.620 --> 00:13:52.740
some protesters were shot and killed.

00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:55.750
In one instance in an isolated portion

00:13:55.750 --> 00:13:59.310
of the Utah concentration
camp known as Topaz,

00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:04.070
a soldier in a guard tower shot
and killed an aged prisoner

00:14:04.070 --> 00:14:06.150
and went unpunished,

00:14:06.150 --> 00:14:08.880
although the available forensic evidence

00:14:10.035 --> 00:14:13.323
justifies an indictment for murder.

00:14:14.520 --> 00:14:18.450
Government lawyers had
feared that the courts might

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:22.860
interfere with incarcerating
civilians by military means

00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:26.128
without a declaration of martial law,

00:14:26.128 --> 00:14:30.440
but alas, their fears were unwarranted.

00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.220
The courts in wartime almost
always give the government

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:37.630
great latitude in questions
that claim to affect

00:14:37.630 --> 00:14:39.430
national security,

00:14:39.430 --> 00:14:43.723
and the Roosevelt court, he
had put each man in his seat,

00:14:44.629 --> 00:14:47.520
was no exception.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:52.520
Four Nisei in their 20s who
did not know one another

00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:56.420
and had little institutional
or community support

00:14:56.420 --> 00:15:00.650
and much opposition from Japanese
American community leaders

00:15:00.650 --> 00:15:03.400
nonviolently resisted
the government's efforts

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:06.530
to incarcerate them
and instituted lawsuits

00:15:06.530 --> 00:15:08.850
that reached the Supreme Court,

00:15:08.850 --> 00:15:11.810
which in the Japanese American cases

00:15:11.810 --> 00:15:16.150
rendered three terrible
decisions in June 1943

00:15:16.150 --> 00:15:18.580
and December 1944,

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:21.960
effectively ratifying
Roosevelt's decisions

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.490
and the actions of
Congress to implement them

00:15:25.490 --> 00:15:29.770
as a constitutional
exercise of the war power.

00:15:29.770 --> 00:15:31.663
In the first case, Hirabayashi,

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:38.222
the court said that, "Imposing a curfew

00:15:38.222 --> 00:15:42.587
"only on persons of Japanese ancestry,

00:15:42.587 --> 00:15:45.867
"even if they were citizens
of the United States,

00:15:45.867 --> 00:15:47.430
"was permissible."

00:15:47.430 --> 00:15:50.607
In the second case,
Korematsu, it said that,

00:15:50.607 --> 00:15:52.567
"A citizen of Japanese ancestry

00:15:52.567 --> 00:15:56.677
"who failed to report for
certain exile and incarceration

00:15:56.677 --> 00:15:58.857
"when ordered to do so by a general

00:15:58.857 --> 00:16:00.570
"could be punished."

00:16:00.570 --> 00:16:02.450
In the third case, Endo,

00:16:02.450 --> 00:16:05.950
ruled that a loyal
citizen could not be held

00:16:05.950 --> 00:16:09.150
but only reference the
war relocation authority

00:16:09.150 --> 00:16:12.220
rather than the president who created it

00:16:12.220 --> 00:16:14.863
or the Congress who
appropriated money for it.

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:18.940
The Endo decision did have the effect

00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:23.290
of forcing the government to
cancel the longstanding orders

00:16:23.290 --> 00:16:26.510
that prevented most
citizen Japanese Americans

00:16:26.510 --> 00:16:28.940
from returning to their West Coast homes,

00:16:28.940 --> 00:16:31.940
even after they had been
released from camps.

00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.378
Apparently two justices had
tipped off the White House

00:16:35.378 --> 00:16:39.710
and/or the Army as to what Endo would hold

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:41.940
and the government
announced the cancellation

00:16:41.940 --> 00:16:45.240
of those orders, keeping
people off the West Coast,

00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:48.590
the day before the decision
was announced by the court.

00:16:48.590 --> 00:16:52.210
It was very much what Justice
Brandeis might have called

00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:54.130
a dirty business.

00:16:54.130 --> 00:16:58.260
The court's December 1944 decisions

00:16:58.260 --> 00:17:00.870
did speed up the closing of the camps

00:17:00.870 --> 00:17:03.070
which were in progress.

00:17:03.070 --> 00:17:05.250
Many of those who have
written about the wartime

00:17:05.250 --> 00:17:08.500
Japanese Americans comment appropriately

00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:10.410
on their resilience,

00:17:10.410 --> 00:17:12.723
often comparing them to bamboo,

00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:18.020
but such celebrations all
too often ignore the fact

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:21.286
that many were so traumatized
by their experience

00:17:21.286 --> 00:17:25.700
and fearful of what life
outside camp might hold for them

00:17:25.700 --> 00:17:28.552
that they literally had to be evicted

00:17:28.552 --> 00:17:32.230
so the camps could be shut down.

00:17:32.230 --> 00:17:36.600
In postwar Los Angeles and
elsewhere on the West Coast,

00:17:36.600 --> 00:17:39.370
where most returning Japanese began to

00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:41.690
reestablish themselves economically

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:44.240
without significant government help,

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.750
there were more Japanese,
mostly elderly aliens,

00:17:47.750 --> 00:17:51.410
on relief than there
had been in the depths

00:17:51.410 --> 00:17:52.610
of the Great Depression.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:56.880
The government did little
to ease their passage.

00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:00.720
The WRA, the War Relocation Authority,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.920
furnished camp leavers
with train or bus tickets

00:18:03.920 --> 00:18:06.670
and $25 a head.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:10.410
In July 1946, President Harry S. Truman

00:18:10.410 --> 00:18:13.950
had a ceremony staged on the
ellipse behind the White House

00:18:13.950 --> 00:18:18.370
for elements of the Nisei
442nd regimental combat team.

00:18:18.370 --> 00:18:22.800
He gave the combat team,
a much decorated unit,

00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:26.227
its seventh distinguished unit citation

00:18:26.227 --> 00:18:30.327
and remarked that, and
I quote the president,

00:18:30.327 --> 00:18:32.647
"You fought not only the enemy,

00:18:32.647 --> 00:18:35.627
"but you fought prejudice
and you have won."

00:18:36.710 --> 00:18:40.157
Truman in his 1948 civil
rights message noted that

00:18:40.157 --> 00:18:44.270
100,000 Japanese Americans
were evacuated from their homes

00:18:44.270 --> 00:18:49.220
in the Pacific states solely
because of their racial origin

00:18:49.220 --> 00:18:52.727
and, I quote, "Suffered
property and business losses

00:18:52.727 --> 00:18:55.567
"as a result of this forced evacuation

00:18:55.567 --> 00:18:57.910
"through no fault of their own."

00:18:57.910 --> 00:19:01.260
At his urging, Congress
enacted the Japanese American

00:19:01.260 --> 00:19:05.810
Claims Act, appropriating
$38 million to settle claims

00:19:05.810 --> 00:19:08.433
that eventually totaled $131 million.

00:19:09.430 --> 00:19:12.783
Congress refused in
1948 to make a judgment

00:19:12.783 --> 00:19:15.940
about the 1942 decision.

00:19:15.940 --> 00:19:19.217
As the Senate committee
on the judiciary put it,

00:19:19.217 --> 00:19:21.867
"The question of whether the evacuation

00:19:21.867 --> 00:19:25.507
"of the Japanese people from
the West Coast was justified

00:19:25.507 --> 00:19:29.090
"is now moot," end of quotation.

00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:32.510
The Justice Department
in a 17 year process

00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:36.130
litigated and adjudicated
claims aggressively.

00:19:36.130 --> 00:19:39.670
One case file that I examined
of a Japanese American

00:19:39.670 --> 00:19:44.340
who had lost his farm in
Kent on Seattle's east side

00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:48.520
because he could not meet
his mortgage payments

00:19:48.520 --> 00:19:49.683
while in camp.

00:19:52.430 --> 00:19:55.410
The file showed that he
had received only half

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:58.680
of the reduced settlement
agreement he had signed.

00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:01.040
When he complained, the Justice Department

00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:02.460
explained it to him.

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:04.980
Washington was a community property state

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:08.230
and since his Caucasian
wife did not have to

00:20:08.230 --> 00:20:09.760
accompany him to camp,

00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:14.760
he, really they, could be
compensated only for his half

00:20:15.310 --> 00:20:19.633
of the loss, not for her half of the loss.

00:20:21.380 --> 00:20:25.720
In September 1950, after the
beginning of the undeclared

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:29.340
Korean War, Congress
passed over Truman's veto

00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.340
the Internal Security Act of 1950,

00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:35.493
an extreme example of
legislative hysteria.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.970
A part of it known as the
Emergency Detention Act of 1950

00:20:40.970 --> 00:20:44.340
introduced and supported
by democratic liberals

00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:48.720
including Hubert H. Humphrey
and Herbert H. Lehman

00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:51.710
was explicitly modeled
on the procedure used

00:20:51.710 --> 00:20:54.600
to incarcerate Japanese Americans.

00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:57.850
Because, as its sponsors
repeatedly pointed out,

00:20:57.850 --> 00:21:01.000
the procedure had been
approved by the Supreme Court.

00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:02.150
Must be all right then.

00:21:03.210 --> 00:21:05.350
The purpose of the statute is described

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:07.570
in section 101 paragraph 14.

00:21:07.570 --> 00:21:09.120
I'm gonna read some legal language

00:21:09.120 --> 00:21:10.130
and you got to listen carefully

00:21:10.130 --> 00:21:12.357
because this is unbelievable.

00:21:12.357 --> 00:21:14.770
"The detention of persons

00:21:17.047 --> 00:21:22.047
"who there is reasonable
grounds to believe

00:21:22.207 --> 00:21:25.297
"will commit," future tense,

00:21:25.297 --> 00:21:28.617
"or conspire with others
to commit espionage

00:21:28.617 --> 00:21:32.097
"is in a time of internal
security emergency

00:21:32.097 --> 00:21:34.737
"essential to the common defense

00:21:34.737 --> 00:21:38.127
"and the safety of the
security of the United States,

00:21:38.127 --> 00:21:40.607
"the people and the constitution
of the United States

00:21:40.607 --> 00:21:45.227
"do declare that the
president," this is section 103,

00:21:45.227 --> 00:21:47.317
"acting through the Attorney General

00:21:47.317 --> 00:21:52.317
"is hereby authorized to
apprehend and by order detain

00:21:52.647 --> 00:21:55.410
"each person as to whom there is,"

00:21:55.410 --> 00:21:57.267
and again this wonderful language,

00:21:57.267 --> 00:22:01.947
"reasonable grounds to believe
will probably engage in

00:22:01.947 --> 00:22:05.287
"or probably will conspire to engage in

00:22:05.287 --> 00:22:09.997
"acts of espionage or sabotage."

00:22:09.997 --> 00:22:12.080
It did not say what would happen

00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.593
if they just dreamed of them.

00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.430
This is the method of Executive Order 9066

00:22:19.430 --> 00:22:21.410
with the Attorney General substituted

00:22:21.410 --> 00:22:23.240
for the Secretary of War,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:27.390
and ideological enemies
substituted for ethnic ones.

00:22:27.390 --> 00:22:32.390
It remained unused as a kind
of sleeper law on the books

00:22:35.300 --> 00:22:38.140
for some 20 years.

00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:41.320
The only part of the
law that required action

00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.310
was a provision providing
that standby facilities

00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:48.540
be prepared and making the
tie to Japanese American

00:22:48.540 --> 00:22:50.870
incarceration a little clearer,

00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:53.730
the facility at Tule Lake was designated

00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:56.523
as one of the standby detention camps.

00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.010
After massive numbers
of Chinese volunteers

00:23:01.010 --> 00:23:04.300
entered the Korean conflict in late 1950,

00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:07.420
many Chinese Americans
feared that they might become

00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:10.260
the target of government reprisals,

00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:13.240
and there was heightened activity

00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.730
by the Immigration and
Naturalization Service

00:23:15.730 --> 00:23:18.160
against Chinese Americans
who were perceived

00:23:18.160 --> 00:23:19.433
to be Communists,

00:23:20.470 --> 00:23:24.210
including a confession
program which offered amnesty

00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:27.740
to persons who had entered
the United States illegally

00:23:27.740 --> 00:23:29.900
as so called paper sons

00:23:29.900 --> 00:23:34.630
if they would inform on
relatives, real and fictive,

00:23:34.630 --> 00:23:36.200
who were radicals.

00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:38.670
At the same time the Justice
and State Departments

00:23:38.670 --> 00:23:41.580
tried to prevent Chinese nationals

00:23:41.580 --> 00:23:44.220
who had received scientific
or technical training

00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.600
in American college and universities

00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:48.268
from returning to China,

00:23:48.268 --> 00:23:50.863
although they would let
them return to Taiwan.

00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.717
Further emphasizing the
ending of ethnic exclusion

00:23:58.717 --> 00:24:02.540
was dropping the ethnic
bars to naturalization,

00:24:02.540 --> 00:24:07.540
begun with the repeal of the
Chinese Exclusion Acts in 1943

00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:11.280
and continued piecemeal until 1952

00:24:12.470 --> 00:24:15.870
when the otherwise reactionary
McCarran-Walter Act

00:24:15.870 --> 00:24:18.500
made naturalization colorblind

00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:22.570
while increasing ideological
barriers to immigration

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:26.330
and even prohibiting visits,
including academic visits,

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:29.863
to the United States by persons
believed to be Communists.

00:24:31.070 --> 00:24:35.940
The long overdue admission
of Hawaii in 1959

00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.830
changed the political
dynamics for Japanese

00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:40.740
and other Asian Americans.

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:43.780
The House of Representatives
had voted to admit Hawaii

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:48.440
in 1947, 1950, and 1953,

00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:50.220
but southern democrats in the Senate

00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:51.853
had blocked it each time.

00:24:52.768 --> 00:24:57.470
Ernest Gruening, the new dealer
who oversaw the territories

00:24:57.470 --> 00:24:59.060
and island possessions

00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.880
remembered that after
several Japanese Americans

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:06.620
had testified during statehood
hearings in Hawaii in 1937,

00:25:07.730 --> 00:25:11.257
Mississippi's John E. Rankin
turned to him and said,

00:25:11.257 --> 00:25:14.717
"My god, if we give them folks statehood

00:25:14.717 --> 00:25:17.427
"we're likely to have
a senator named Moto."

00:25:22.173 --> 00:25:25.770
In fact from its first
post statehood election,

00:25:25.770 --> 00:25:28.060
Hawaii has sent a steady progression

00:25:29.223 --> 00:25:31.860
of Asian Americans to Congress

00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:35.400
beginning with Hiram
Leong Fong in the Senate

00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:38.140
and Daniel Ken Inouye in the House.

00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.320
It is difficult to overstate
the positive effect

00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.320
that this representation has
had on the changing roles

00:25:46.570 --> 00:25:50.650
of Japanese and Asian
Americans in American life.

00:25:50.650 --> 00:25:53.470
Now that we have reached what
is roughly the halfway point

00:25:53.470 --> 00:25:57.450
in our story, it seems appropriate to ask

00:25:57.450 --> 00:26:00.350
where, in what the Library of Congress

00:26:00.350 --> 00:26:03.190
delights in calling the American memory

00:26:03.190 --> 00:26:08.190
were the wartime experiences
of 120,000 Japanese Americans

00:26:08.220 --> 00:26:11.530
nearly a quarter of a century
after all of the camps

00:26:11.530 --> 00:26:13.853
which held them had been closed down.

00:26:14.710 --> 00:26:18.572
One cannot say that their
experience was secret or unknown.

00:26:18.572 --> 00:26:22.350
It had been described in
daily wartime newspapers

00:26:22.350 --> 00:26:24.080
and there had been books and articles

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.320
by scholars and journalists,

00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:30.400
but there was simply no
place in the victory culture

00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:33.310
which dominated the
postwar quarter century

00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.973
for what could be called
an American war crime.

00:26:39.180 --> 00:26:43.120
Particularly one that
claimed 120,000 victims.

00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.140
Many of those victims themselves

00:26:45.140 --> 00:26:47.330
wanted to hear no more about it

00:26:47.330 --> 00:26:49.609
and many of the younger Nisei and Sansei

00:26:49.609 --> 00:26:52.070
literally knew nothing about it,

00:26:52.070 --> 00:26:54.763
including some who had
been born in the camps.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.100
College students learn precious little

00:26:58.100 --> 00:27:01.223
about what happened to Japanese
Americans in that time.

00:27:02.620 --> 00:27:07.110
The year I began my graduate
study at UCLA, 1957,

00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.560
not one of the several historians
teaching survey courses

00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:13.993
in American history even
mentioned it in lectures,

00:27:15.410 --> 00:27:19.490
and the most extensive
standard textbook treatment

00:27:19.490 --> 00:27:22.420
in a book whose lead author was the iconic

00:27:22.420 --> 00:27:24.720
Columbia historian Richard Hofstadter,

00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:27.510
who gave this lecture in 1966,

00:27:27.510 --> 00:27:31.427
allotted it just one long
sentence which I'm gonna read.

00:27:31.427 --> 00:27:36.007
"Since almost no one doubted
the necessity for the war,

00:27:36.007 --> 00:27:39.097
"there was much less
intolerance than there had been

00:27:39.097 --> 00:27:41.227
"in white World War II,

00:27:41.227 --> 00:27:43.827
"although large numbers
of Japanese Americans

00:27:43.827 --> 00:27:47.777
"were put into internment
camps under circumstances

00:27:47.777 --> 00:27:52.240
"that many Americans were later
to judge unfair or worse."

00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:54.670
End of quotation.

00:27:54.670 --> 00:27:57.870
Many college texts of those
years said nothing at all

00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:04.880
about the Japanese
American wartime or ideal,

00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:07.090
and I am not aware of any mention of it

00:28:07.090 --> 00:28:10.633
in a secondary textbook before 1965.

00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:14.400
For most of the rest of the afternoon

00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.970
I'm gonna try and trace and explain

00:28:16.970 --> 00:28:20.210
how the World War II mass incarceration,

00:28:20.210 --> 00:28:23.980
so little noted in that
first quarter century

00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:28.290
following the war, was restored
to the American memory.

00:28:28.290 --> 00:28:32.490
Two distinct narratives of
this restoration have emerged.

00:28:32.490 --> 00:28:37.480
One celebrates the eventual
vindication of a betrayed people

00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:40.310
and is the kind of stories
that audiences like to hear,

00:28:40.310 --> 00:28:41.850
and I'll tell it,

00:28:41.850 --> 00:28:45.572
while the other makes the incarceration

00:28:45.572 --> 00:28:49.297
an increasingly
influential reference point

00:28:49.297 --> 00:28:52.790
for those concerned with the
expansion of the American

00:28:52.790 --> 00:28:57.230
security state and the
corresponding shrinkage

00:28:57.230 --> 00:28:58.883
of individual rights.

00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:04.423
Thus the tale becomes both
triumphal and cautionary.

00:29:05.790 --> 00:29:08.073
The focus of the story also changes.

00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:13.810
Before 1970, Japanese Americans
were largely portrayed

00:29:13.810 --> 00:29:17.180
as the objects of history.

00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:21.340
After that time they
regularly appear as actors

00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:23.353
affecting their own destinies.

00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:28.890
By the beginning of the 1970s,

00:29:28.890 --> 00:29:32.090
a growing sense of Asian
American community consciousness

00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:33.063
was developing.

00:29:34.050 --> 00:29:37.000
Nowhere stronger than in San Francisco,

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:40.400
where the engineer historian Him Mark Lai

00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:43.270
and the community activist Edison Uno

00:29:43.270 --> 00:29:46.690
and others created the
first college courses

00:29:46.690 --> 00:29:48.460
in Asian American history

00:29:48.460 --> 00:29:50.890
at San Francisco State College.

00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:55.700
Courses long shunned by more
prestigious universities.

00:29:55.700 --> 00:29:58.250
Uno, one of the first to propose

00:29:58.250 --> 00:30:00.810
what became known as redress,

00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.924
was instrumental in a campaign

00:30:02.924 --> 00:30:06.620
aided by the Hawaiian
Congressional Delegation

00:30:06.620 --> 00:30:10.360
to repeal the Emergency
Detention Act of 1950,

00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.860
the act whose terms I read earlier,

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.655
and Assistant Attorney General

00:30:16.655 --> 00:30:21.655
told the Senate judiciary
committee that the unfounded fears

00:30:21.842 --> 00:30:25.560
of many Americans, that the
act might be used to apprehend

00:30:25.560 --> 00:30:29.440
and detain citizens who
hold unpopular beliefs,

00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:32.294
and that the repeal of this legislation

00:30:32.294 --> 00:30:35.180
will allay such fears.

00:30:35.180 --> 00:30:38.590
This benefit outweighs
any potential advantage

00:30:38.590 --> 00:30:40.740
which the act may provide.

00:30:40.740 --> 00:30:43.840
The repeal, which was passed
by lopsided majorities

00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.640
in both houses in September 1971

00:30:47.604 --> 00:30:50.313
and signed by the President Nixon,

00:30:51.897 --> 00:30:55.240
was called the Non-Detention Act,

00:30:55.240 --> 00:30:57.197
contained the following sentence.

00:30:57.197 --> 00:31:00.277
"No citizen shall be imprisoned
or otherwise detained

00:31:00.277 --> 00:31:01.447
"by the United States

00:31:01.447 --> 00:31:04.650
"except pursuant to an act of Congress."

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:08.653
It was made nugatory by
the 2001 Patriot Act.

00:31:09.870 --> 00:31:11.230
President Gerald R. Ford,

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:13.960
in a move that surprised contemporaries,

00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:17.690
chose the 34th anniversary of
Roosevelt's executive order

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.410
to repeal it with a
bicentennial proclamation

00:31:21.410 --> 00:31:25.000
which observed that an
honest reckoning of history

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:28.777
had to acknowledge our national mistakes.

00:31:28.777 --> 00:31:31.888
"We now know," the president said,

00:31:31.888 --> 00:31:34.547
"what we should have known then.

00:31:34.547 --> 00:31:37.667
"Not only was that evacuation wrong,"

00:31:38.630 --> 00:31:42.377
first time an American
president had said that,

00:31:42.377 --> 00:31:47.180
"but Japanese American were
and are loyal Americans."

00:31:47.180 --> 00:31:51.160
Ford's proclamation, little
notice in the National Press,

00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.840
had a paradoxical effect

00:31:52.840 --> 00:31:55.570
within the Japanese American community.

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:58.380
Conservative community leaders
who were resisting efforts

00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.150
by mostly younger activists

00:32:00.150 --> 00:32:03.170
who were calling for a formal apology

00:32:03.170 --> 00:32:05.910
and some kind of monetary compensation

00:32:05.910 --> 00:32:10.880
could now argue that Ford's
action was such an apology

00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:14.660
and that attempts to get
monetary compensation

00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:15.893
were unrealistic.

00:32:16.910 --> 00:32:19.920
The activists of course drew
particular encouragement

00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.460
from the action by a generally
conservative president.

00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:25.840
The Redress Movement
was eventually embraced

00:32:25.840 --> 00:32:28.120
by most Japanese Americans.

00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:33.120
The stunning, unprecedented,
and highly improbable result,

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:37.748
Harry Katano called it
the impossible dream,

00:32:37.748 --> 00:32:40.887
that the activists eventually
gained from Congress

00:32:40.887 --> 00:32:44.420
and a president went on until 1988

00:32:44.420 --> 00:32:49.420
and was not fully consummated
until February 1999.

00:32:50.850 --> 00:32:53.560
The struggle within the
Japanese American community

00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:55.260
was acute and complex,

00:32:55.260 --> 00:32:58.250
and I'm not gonna go into all the details.

00:32:58.250 --> 00:33:03.250
Initially only a minority
favored a campaign for redress.

00:33:03.420 --> 00:33:07.730
The yet as unpersuaded majority
was not so much opposed

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:10.974
on principle, although
such opposition did exist,

00:33:10.974 --> 00:33:15.340
but it was rather a matter of misbelief

00:33:15.340 --> 00:33:18.880
as to the possibility of a good result.

00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.920
After two failed attempts

00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:23.470
the activists succeeded
in getting the endorsement

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:26.020
of the ethnic group's major organization,

00:33:26.020 --> 00:33:29.910
the Japanese American
Citizens League, JCL,

00:33:29.910 --> 00:33:32.330
at its 1978 convention.

00:33:32.330 --> 00:33:35.519
Its chief goals were a
formal apology from Congress

00:33:35.519 --> 00:33:40.519
and individual payments
to victims of $25,000,

00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.410
thereby setting an upper
limit on what individuals

00:33:44.410 --> 00:33:46.570
could even hope to receive.

00:33:46.570 --> 00:33:48.860
Only then did the JCL committee

00:33:48.860 --> 00:33:51.490
appointed to direct the Redress Campaign

00:33:51.490 --> 00:33:53.990
meet with the Japanese
American members of Congress

00:33:53.990 --> 00:33:55.860
to plan strategy.

00:33:55.860 --> 00:33:58.180
It received a rude awakening.

00:33:58.180 --> 00:34:01.560
The elected officials, with
Senator Inouye taking the lead,

00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:04.210
said that no bill calling for compensation

00:34:04.210 --> 00:34:06.134
could possibly pass,

00:34:06.134 --> 00:34:09.470
but promised to support a bill
calling for the appointment

00:34:09.470 --> 00:34:12.650
of a presidential
commission to investigate

00:34:12.650 --> 00:34:14.920
what happened in 1942

00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.163
and recommend any remedies
that it found appropriate.

00:34:20.690 --> 00:34:22.393
This upset an awful lot of people.

00:34:23.670 --> 00:34:27.330
The committee was forced to
accept the commission's approach

00:34:27.330 --> 00:34:29.600
and the bill sponsored by Inouye,

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:33.120
with more than a majority
of the Senate as cosponsors,

00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:35.620
easily passed Congress in the closing days

00:34:35.620 --> 00:34:37.320
of the Carter administration,

00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:40.470
under whose aegis the
commission was appointed.

00:34:40.470 --> 00:34:43.880
The misnamed committee
on the wartime relocation

00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:45.780
and interment of civilians

00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:50.650
was a blue ribbon group
whose most effective members

00:34:50.650 --> 00:34:55.220
were former Supreme Court
Justice Arthur J. Goldberg

00:34:55.220 --> 00:34:58.610
and Philadelphia Judge William Marutani,

00:34:58.610 --> 00:35:00.680
the only Nisei on the panel

00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:03.950
who had been incarcerated
briefly in camp at Tule Lake

00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:06.530
before being released to go to college.

00:35:06.530 --> 00:35:10.200
It took testimony from
more than 750 witnesses

00:35:10.200 --> 00:35:13.480
during 20 days of hearings in the Capitol

00:35:13.480 --> 00:35:15.030
and cities across the country,

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:16.733
particularly on the West Coast.

00:35:18.110 --> 00:35:22.430
Although one erudite but
insensitive staff attorney

00:35:22.430 --> 00:35:26.398
described the hearings as,
"Irrelevant freak shows,"

00:35:26.398 --> 00:35:30.120
they were an important rite of passage,

00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.750
as hundreds of former camp inmates

00:35:32.750 --> 00:35:36.850
narrating their captivity
after four decades of silence,

00:35:36.850 --> 00:35:41.580
often punctured by tears,
shouts, and curses,

00:35:41.580 --> 00:35:45.220
and otherwise behaving in
ways the Japanese Americans

00:35:45.220 --> 00:35:47.720
rarely behaved in public.

00:35:47.720 --> 00:35:51.970
A few years later they
surprised not only themselves

00:35:53.790 --> 00:35:56.363
and their children and
their grandchildren.

00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.713
A few years later a
Nisei woman speaking to

00:35:59.713 --> 00:36:03.450
a Nisei Week audience
at the 50th anniversary

00:36:03.450 --> 00:36:08.450
of her wartime acceptance at
a small Missouri Bible college

00:36:08.730 --> 00:36:13.730
out of camp said that, "I
never said anything to anybody

00:36:15.387 --> 00:36:18.427
"before speaking at a commission hearing.

00:36:18.427 --> 00:36:21.167
"That loosened my tongue

00:36:21.167 --> 00:36:22.877
"and I have been talking about it,

00:36:22.877 --> 00:36:26.360
"what it was like in camp, ever since."

00:36:26.360 --> 00:36:29.410
The CWRIC published its unanimous report

00:36:29.410 --> 00:36:33.480
titled Personal Justice
Denied in February 1983.

00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.050
It was a rude and branch condemnation

00:36:37.197 --> 00:36:40.460
of what the government had
done to Japanese Americans

00:36:40.460 --> 00:36:44.787
which concluded that, I'm
gonna read a long paragraph,

00:36:44.787 --> 00:36:48.327
"Executive Order 9066 was not justified

00:36:48.327 --> 00:36:50.207
"by military necessity,

00:36:50.207 --> 00:36:52.517
"and the decisions that followed from it,

00:36:52.517 --> 00:36:56.267
"detention, ending detention,
and ending exclusion

00:36:56.267 --> 00:36:59.717
"were not driven by analysis
of military conditions.

00:36:59.717 --> 00:37:03.277
"A grave injustice was
done to American citizens

00:37:03.277 --> 00:37:06.387
"and resident aliens of Japanese ancestry,

00:37:06.387 --> 00:37:08.427
"who without individual review

00:37:08.427 --> 00:37:10.957
"or any probative evidence against them

00:37:10.957 --> 00:37:14.907
"were excluded, removed, and
detained by the United States

00:37:14.907 --> 00:37:15.993
"during World War II.

00:37:17.127 --> 00:37:20.567
"The report was issued
without recommendations,

00:37:20.567 --> 00:37:22.360
"which were delayed until June."

00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.623
That was in February.

00:37:25.610 --> 00:37:29.250
One commissioner, sitting Republican

00:37:29.250 --> 00:37:31.910
Californian Congressman Daniel Lee Lungren

00:37:31.910 --> 00:37:33.780
dissented from the recommendation

00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:36.460
of a monetary award to individuals.

00:37:36.460 --> 00:37:39.370
The other eight commissioners
agreed that each survivor

00:37:39.370 --> 00:37:44.370
should receive a one time
compensatory payment of $20,000.

00:37:45.010 --> 00:37:47.600
Other recommendations
were for a formal apology

00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.010
from the Congress,

00:37:49.010 --> 00:37:51.550
a presidential pardon for
all who were convicted

00:37:51.550 --> 00:37:56.400
of violating edicts of the
Western Defense Command,

00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:59.150
and that the Justice
Department review all federal

00:37:59.150 --> 00:38:02.293
convictions of ethnic
Japanese during the war,

00:38:02.293 --> 00:38:04.910
congressional instructions to all agencies

00:38:04.910 --> 00:38:07.840
to be liberal in restoring
any rights or benefits

00:38:07.840 --> 00:38:09.870
Japanese American might have lost

00:38:09.870 --> 00:38:13.530
because or stemming from
their wartime mistreatment,

00:38:13.530 --> 00:38:17.311
and finally that Congress
fund an educational foundation

00:38:17.311 --> 00:38:20.380
to educate Americans about
what their government

00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:23.273
had inflicted on Japanese
Americans during the war.

00:38:24.300 --> 00:38:28.360
The bill that enacted the
commission's recommendations,

00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:30.543
the Civil Liberties Act of 1988,

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:34.703
was given the number HR442,

00:38:35.720 --> 00:38:37.620
the designation of the Nisei unit

00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:40.510
which fought so well in Italy and France.

00:38:40.510 --> 00:38:43.290
Meanwhile in November 1983,

00:38:43.290 --> 00:38:47.000
five months after the
commission's recommendations,

00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.960
a federal district judge in San Francisco

00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:53.620
voided Fred Korematsu's
original conviction,

00:38:53.620 --> 00:38:56.268
which had been upheld by the Supreme Court

00:38:56.268 --> 00:39:00.190
in the most potent of the three wartime

00:39:00.190 --> 00:39:02.550
Japanese American decisions.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:06.680
This highly unusual,
perhaps unique situation

00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:08.580
had come about because Peter Irons,

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.840
a political scientist and attorney,

00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.760
had in the course of researching a book

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:14.490
about the Justice Department,

00:39:14.490 --> 00:39:16.870
found evidence of blatant misconduct,

00:39:16.870 --> 00:39:18.910
deliberate suppression of evidence,

00:39:18.910 --> 00:39:22.800
in the preparation of
the government's brief

00:39:24.200 --> 00:39:28.513
presented to the court in 1943 and 1944.

00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.870
Irons and a group of
largely Sansei attorneys

00:39:32.870 --> 00:39:36.790
all working pro bono were able to reopen

00:39:36.790 --> 00:39:41.790
not only Korematsu's
case in San Francisco,

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:44.515
but Hirabayashi's case in Seattle

00:39:44.515 --> 00:39:49.515
and a second curfew case involving
Minoru Yasui in Portland.

00:39:49.670 --> 00:39:52.860
Only Korematsu's case
need concern us here,

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:54.710
although all the cases are important.

00:39:55.590 --> 00:39:57.450
The attorneys applied successfully

00:39:57.450 --> 00:40:00.020
for a writ of coram nobis,

00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:02.860
the Latin means "the error before us,"

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:04.980
which had been used by
the way by Alger Hiss

00:40:04.980 --> 00:40:07.770
in his unsuccessful
attempt to get his 1950

00:40:07.770 --> 00:40:10.950
perjury conviction overturned.

00:40:10.950 --> 00:40:13.640
After considerable delay
the Justice Department

00:40:13.640 --> 00:40:15.320
moved to vacate the conviction.

00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:17.416
In other words they were willing to say,

00:40:17.416 --> 00:40:20.670
"Okay, vacate the conviction."

00:40:20.670 --> 00:40:25.670
But refused to admit previous
government misconduct.

00:40:26.740 --> 00:40:31.740
The district judge Marilyn
Hall Patel, a Carter appointee,

00:40:31.930 --> 00:40:34.950
ruled the government's
motion out of order,

00:40:34.950 --> 00:40:38.490
accepted Korematsu's petition coram nobis,

00:40:38.490 --> 00:40:40.790
voided the original indictment,

00:40:40.790 --> 00:40:44.070
and reversed Korematsu's
original conviction.

00:40:44.070 --> 00:40:46.693
In her opinion, she warned that,

00:40:49.985 --> 00:40:52.467
this was in 1983,

00:40:52.467 --> 00:40:55.363
"Korematsu stands as a constant caution

00:40:55.363 --> 00:41:00.030
"that in times of war or
declared military necessity

00:41:02.557 --> 00:41:05.987
"our institutions must be vigilant,

00:41:05.987 --> 00:41:07.907
"that the government must not be used

00:41:07.907 --> 00:41:11.310
"to protect government
activities from close scrutiny

00:41:12.447 --> 00:41:14.410
"and accountability."

00:41:14.410 --> 00:41:17.191
The successful attorneys
were delighted by the victory

00:41:17.191 --> 00:41:20.970
but were disappointed that the
government failed to appeal,

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:25.090
as they had hoped that the
case might be again heard

00:41:25.090 --> 00:41:28.550
by the Supreme Court and reversed there.

00:41:28.550 --> 00:41:31.860
In addition, their victory
was one more argument

00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:34.983
for the Redress Bill in Congress.

00:41:35.930 --> 00:41:38.108
Reagan's Justice Department,

00:41:38.108 --> 00:41:43.108
opposing the bill, told a
congressional committee,

00:41:43.427 --> 00:41:48.277
"It may be the commission is correct

00:41:48.277 --> 00:41:49.967
"in concluding that the assumptions

00:41:49.967 --> 00:41:53.200
"on which the exclusion and
detention programs were based

00:41:54.077 --> 00:41:55.427
"were erroneous,

00:41:55.427 --> 00:42:00.057
"but some of its conclusions are wrong.

00:42:00.057 --> 00:42:02.597
"These matters are best left to historical

00:42:02.597 --> 00:42:07.107
"and scholarly analysis rather
than debated by Congress."

00:42:08.550 --> 00:42:11.860
The legislative process
was painfully slow.

00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:15.400
A divided Congress, Republican
control of the Senate,

00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:17.490
Democratic control of the House,

00:42:17.490 --> 00:42:20.020
the hostility of the administration

00:42:20.020 --> 00:42:23.830
and the constant budget
crises of the 1980s

00:42:23.830 --> 00:42:26.710
meant that final passage
came more than five years

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:29.110
after the commission
issued its recommendations.

00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:33.420
HR442 initially passed the Senate

00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:36.920
by a comfortable 69 to 27 margin,

00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:41.537
but similar House approval
by a vote of 243 to 141

00:42:41.537 --> 00:42:44.840
was close enough to suggest
that a presidential veto

00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:46.290
would be upheld,

00:42:46.290 --> 00:42:49.663
and all the signs were
that Reagan would veto it.

00:42:50.670 --> 00:42:54.340
But on the day that the
conference committee report

00:42:54.340 --> 00:42:56.870
adjusting minor differences
between the House

00:42:56.870 --> 00:42:59.934
and the Senate versions
was to be voted on,

00:42:59.934 --> 00:43:01.880
the president sent a letter

00:43:01.880 --> 00:43:04.150
to the Democratic Speaker of the House

00:43:04.150 --> 00:43:07.420
endorsing the bill and urging its passage,

00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.727
and I quote him, "To end a sad
chapter in American history

00:43:11.727 --> 00:43:14.977
"in a way that reaffirms
America's commitment

00:43:14.977 --> 00:43:19.590
"to the preservation of
liberty and justice for all."

00:43:19.590 --> 00:43:21.180
At the bill's signing ceremony

00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:25.577
the president read from a
December 1945 newspaper clipping

00:43:25.577 --> 00:43:29.140
describing General Joseph
W. Stilwell's award

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.680
of a posthumous
Distinguished Service Cross

00:43:32.760 --> 00:43:37.760
to the sister of Staff
Sergeant Kazuo Masuda

00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:42.670
of the 442nd at her farm home
in Orange County, California.

00:43:42.670 --> 00:43:45.320
Ignoring what General Stilwell had said,

00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:48.143
the president still
reading from the clipping,

00:43:48.143 --> 00:43:51.557
"Described how the motion picture actress

00:43:51.557 --> 00:43:54.185
"Louise Allbritton, a Texas girl,

00:43:54.185 --> 00:43:57.037
"told how a Texas battalion had been saved

00:43:57.037 --> 00:43:58.453
"by the 442nd.

00:43:59.327 --> 00:44:02.417
"Other show business
personalities paid tributes.

00:44:02.417 --> 00:44:05.097
"Robert Young, Will Rogers Jr.,

00:44:05.097 --> 00:44:08.017
"and one young actor," and
this is still quoting Reagan,

00:44:08.017 --> 00:44:12.387
"one young actor said, 'Blood
that has soaked into the sands

00:44:12.387 --> 00:44:15.057
"'of the beach is all of one color.

00:44:15.057 --> 00:44:17.537
"'America stands unique in the world.

00:44:17.537 --> 00:44:20.037
"'The only country not founded on race

00:44:20.037 --> 00:44:23.460
"'but on a way, an ideal.'"

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.180
The name of that young actor,

00:44:25.180 --> 00:44:27.803
I hope I pronounce this
right, was Ronald Reagan.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:31.680
Unlike many of Reagan's anecdotes,

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.803
this one was largely true.

00:44:33.803 --> 00:44:35.430
(audience laughs)

00:44:35.430 --> 00:44:39.210
The young actor of course was 34 year old

00:44:39.210 --> 00:44:41.260
Air Force Captain Reagan,

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:44.838
completing his three
years of military service

00:44:44.838 --> 00:44:46.670
for which he never left home

00:44:46.670 --> 00:44:48.270
because it was all in Hollywood.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:52.870
Stilwell was doing what he was doing

00:44:52.870 --> 00:44:55.420
in response to orders from Truman

00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.110
after he had been alerted
by Eleanor Roosevelt

00:44:59.110 --> 00:45:03.211
about the abuse returning
Japanese Americans were receiving

00:45:03.211 --> 00:45:06.402
after returning to the West Coast.

00:45:06.402 --> 00:45:10.830
Reagan's lines were written by military

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:12.463
public relations writers.

00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:16.890
Despite the low comedy of the ceremony,

00:45:16.890 --> 00:45:20.523
something important had been
done and something unique.

00:45:21.830 --> 00:45:25.390
A victorious nation acknowledged
that it had done wrong

00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:28.610
and paid a significant price for it.

00:45:28.610 --> 00:45:32.670
Eventually some 82,000
persons received payments

00:45:32.670 --> 00:45:35.120
totalling $1.6 billion,

00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:39.610
and in an echo effect in the
days after Reagan's signing

00:45:39.610 --> 00:45:42.278
the Canadian government
concluded negotiations

00:45:42.278 --> 00:45:46.747
with a Japanese Canadian
organization for similar payments,

00:45:46.747 --> 00:45:50.810
$21,000 to a much
smaller number of victims

00:45:50.810 --> 00:45:54.070
of its parallel wartime policies.

00:45:54.070 --> 00:45:55.770
While human rights advocates had hoped

00:45:55.770 --> 00:45:58.300
that the principles and
meaningful monetary redress

00:45:58.300 --> 00:46:01.800
for wartime actions against
the nation's own citizens

00:46:01.800 --> 00:46:04.017
would be adopted elsewhere,

00:46:04.017 --> 00:46:07.913
it has had no tangible effect
outside of North America.

00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.300
An important intangible change

00:46:11.300 --> 00:46:14.420
was that the wartime
exile and incarceration,

00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:17.330
all but forgotten in the postwar decades,

00:46:17.330 --> 00:46:21.223
was firmly implanted
in the American memory.

00:46:23.534 --> 00:46:26.820
This was demonstrated
with striking clarity

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.810
in the aftermath of what we
have learned to call 9-11.

00:46:30.810 --> 00:46:32.750
In the days following the destruction

00:46:32.750 --> 00:46:37.220
of the World Trade Center
and its more than 3,000 dead,

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.930
and throughout the nine years
since that horrific event,

00:46:40.930 --> 00:46:44.540
countless persons have
raised the haunting specter

00:46:45.810 --> 00:46:50.810
of Arab or Middle Eastern
or now more often Muslims

00:46:52.070 --> 00:46:54.657
becoming the 21st century's equivalent

00:46:54.657 --> 00:46:57.270
of Japanese Americans.

00:46:57.270 --> 00:47:01.819
Historical analogies are
always tricky propositions,

00:47:01.819 --> 00:47:06.819
particularly when one is dealing
with a contemporary event.

00:47:08.290 --> 00:47:13.060
Current history is after all
a contradiction in terms.

00:47:13.060 --> 00:47:15.690
Nevertheless there are
striking similarities

00:47:15.690 --> 00:47:19.800
as well as differences
between the events of 1941-45

00:47:21.770 --> 00:47:24.030
and those of our current decade.

00:47:24.030 --> 00:47:28.030
In both periods, race prejudices

00:47:28.030 --> 00:47:31.300
augmented by religious
prejudice in our time

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:34.706
and war hysteria were
abundantly prevalent,

00:47:34.706 --> 00:47:38.870
but at the highest levels
of recent government

00:47:38.870 --> 00:47:41.820
there were repeated warnings
not to make assumptions

00:47:41.820 --> 00:47:46.820
about guilt based on race,
ethnicity, or religion,

00:47:49.970 --> 00:47:52.980
and there was an almost total restriction

00:47:52.980 --> 00:47:56.333
of prohibitive actions,
of punitive actions,

00:47:58.410 --> 00:48:00.630
to non-citizens.

00:48:00.630 --> 00:48:02.530
But when it came to treatment of prisoners

00:48:02.530 --> 00:48:05.610
we must remember that
while the World War II

00:48:05.610 --> 00:48:08.420
Afrika Korps veterans brought to America

00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:10.940
later described their
places of confinement

00:48:10.940 --> 00:48:15.900
as goldene kafig, a golden cage.

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:18.930
No such praise will
come from the survivors

00:48:18.930 --> 00:48:23.668
of Guantanamo or its
populist version Abu Gharib.

00:48:23.668 --> 00:48:27.660
While in the aftermath of
Roosevelt's 1942 order,

00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:30.550
there was almost no public criticism

00:48:30.550 --> 00:48:34.290
of the extreme measures taken
against Japanese Americans,

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:37.130
so many public figures
and others made reference

00:48:37.130 --> 00:48:41.330
to the Japanese American
experience after 9-11

00:48:41.330 --> 00:48:44.140
that it seems obvious that
it increased awareness

00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:46.950
of what had happened in 1942

00:48:46.950 --> 00:48:49.630
was a factor in the
heightened sensibilities

00:48:49.630 --> 00:48:54.150
about violations of civil rights in 2001,

00:48:54.150 --> 00:48:57.630
and no one should imagine
that what has happened

00:48:57.630 --> 00:49:00.980
in the last nine years
is on the same scale

00:49:00.980 --> 00:49:03.133
as what happened in 1942.

00:49:04.980 --> 00:49:08.100
Some critics have insisted
that even to mention

00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:12.153
both eras in the same breath
is inappropriate and worse.

00:49:14.600 --> 00:49:17.930
Those optimists assure us

00:49:20.201 --> 00:49:23.330
that a mass incarceration
of American citizens

00:49:23.330 --> 00:49:25.880
in concentration camps will not recur

00:49:27.230 --> 00:49:30.190
and point to the relative mildness

00:49:30.190 --> 00:49:33.290
of the governmental reaction after 9-11

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:34.733
as evidence of that.

00:49:36.200 --> 00:49:39.800
But reflection on our past suggests

00:49:39.800 --> 00:49:41.823
we ought not to be so sanguine.

00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:45.680
We must remember that it
was not just the disaster

00:49:45.680 --> 00:49:46.763
at Pearl Harbor,

00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:51.250
but the subsequent sequence
of Japanese triumphs

00:49:51.250 --> 00:49:54.450
that triggered Executive Order 9066

00:49:54.450 --> 00:49:57.980
74 days after Pearl Harbor.

00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:02.630
Shouldn't we ask if terrorist
attacks on American soil

00:50:02.630 --> 00:50:05.490
had continued after September 11th,

00:50:05.490 --> 00:50:08.330
would the current government reaction

00:50:08.330 --> 00:50:10.530
have been so moderate?

00:50:10.530 --> 00:50:14.240
And were there to be a
recurrence of such a tax,

00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:17.730
would there not be those in
our security establishment

00:50:17.730 --> 00:50:21.600
who would argue that the
moderation after 9-11

00:50:21.600 --> 00:50:26.105
was a contributing factor
in the renewed assaults?

00:50:26.105 --> 00:50:27.109
Thank you.

00:50:27.109 --> 00:50:30.109
(audience clapping)

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:37.990
- [Man] In February 1941 I was a teenager

00:50:37.990 --> 00:50:40.170
and I can remember very clearly

00:50:41.010 --> 00:50:45.360
that we were told that there
were Japanese submarines

00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:47.950
off the California coast,

00:50:47.950 --> 00:50:49.758
God knows how many,

00:50:49.758 --> 00:50:54.470
and that there have been
signals back and forth

00:50:54.470 --> 00:50:58.320
from the land to the subs,
from the subs to the land,

00:50:58.320 --> 00:51:03.320
and of course this was,

00:51:03.362 --> 00:51:05.400
we talked about the national hysteria,

00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:08.110
this was sort of the basis of it.

00:51:08.110 --> 00:51:10.920
I was wondering what can you tell us

00:51:10.920 --> 00:51:13.413
that the West Coast military command,

00:51:14.260 --> 00:51:17.290
what did they tell Washington
about the situation

00:51:17.290 --> 00:51:19.081
at that time?

00:51:19.081 --> 00:51:23.243
Were they part of this canard
about the Japanese subs?

00:51:24.110 --> 00:51:28.750
Did they tell Washington
we needed to do this?

00:51:28.750 --> 00:51:30.550
Did they tell them we should not do it?

00:51:30.550 --> 00:51:31.693
What can you tell us?

00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:37.293
- Well, first of all
there were two submarines,

00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:41.700
one of which popped up off Santa Barbara

00:51:41.700 --> 00:51:45.113
and fired several shots
at some oil tankers ...

00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:52.490
At some oil tanks on the
hillside and missed them.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:55.380
The commander of that sub, by
the way unlike most commanders

00:51:55.380 --> 00:51:59.422
of Japanese submarines, survived the war

00:51:59.422 --> 00:52:03.490
and was interrogated by American officials

00:52:03.490 --> 00:52:05.530
and he said that he was terrified,

00:52:05.530 --> 00:52:08.720
that he was sure that
the entire American Navy

00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:10.240
was gonna pounce on him immediately,

00:52:10.240 --> 00:52:14.980
but actually there were no warships at sea

00:52:14.980 --> 00:52:17.920
within hundreds of miles of where he was.

00:52:17.920 --> 00:52:22.673
There's no evidence whatsoever of signals.

00:52:24.026 --> 00:52:26.970
Washington was told in the report

00:52:27.944 --> 00:52:30.090
from the Western Defense Command

00:52:31.610 --> 00:52:34.470
of Lieutenant General John L. DeWitt,

00:52:34.470 --> 00:52:36.770
again who I haven't
mentioned in this lecture,

00:52:38.310 --> 00:52:40.160
that there were all kinds of signals,

00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:42.980
radio signals and others,

00:52:42.980 --> 00:52:45.980
and that has been proved
to be a total canard.

00:52:45.980 --> 00:52:48.050
That was a lie.

00:52:48.050 --> 00:52:49.313
There was hysteria.

00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:56.030
The Army quickly understood
that the Japanese,

00:52:56.030 --> 00:52:59.130
that the Great Los Angeles Air Raid

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:01.060
was started when one gun

00:53:04.040 --> 00:53:07.020
near Santa Monica fired
at a weather balloon

00:53:07.020 --> 00:53:08.930
thinking that it was a Japanese plane,

00:53:08.930 --> 00:53:10.850
and then antiaircraft guns all over.

00:53:10.850 --> 00:53:12.080
It was the middle of the night.

00:53:12.080 --> 00:53:16.430
Antiaircraft guns fired hundreds of rounds

00:53:17.490 --> 00:53:19.640
and insurance companies
knew because there was

00:53:19.640 --> 00:53:23.050
great damage to automobiles
parked on the streets

00:53:23.050 --> 00:53:26.060
of Los Angeles when some
of the shrapnel comes down

00:53:26.060 --> 00:53:27.770
because you send one of those
things up and it explodes

00:53:27.770 --> 00:53:30.223
and comes down to Earth.

00:53:31.390 --> 00:53:36.390
There was not one single
documented instance

00:53:36.940 --> 00:53:39.700
of espionage or sabotage,

00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.656
and to anticipate a question

00:53:42.656 --> 00:53:47.656
about the governor of California
who was at that time ...

00:53:48.650 --> 00:53:50.990
I think he really wants me
to talk about Earl Warren

00:53:50.990 --> 00:53:53.338
who was the governor of
California at that time.

00:53:53.338 --> 00:53:57.876
It was bad enough but wasn't
as bad as his attorney general

00:53:57.876 --> 00:54:02.876
Earl Warren, who at a meeting
of law enforcement officials

00:54:05.050 --> 00:54:10.050
said accurately, "There
hasn't been one single case

00:54:10.387 --> 00:54:12.767
"of espionage and sabotage.

00:54:12.767 --> 00:54:15.207
"That's what makes it so dangerous.

00:54:15.207 --> 00:54:18.230
"There's a conspiracy to lull us to sleep

00:54:19.728 --> 00:54:23.370
"and our time will come,
we don't know when."

00:54:23.370 --> 00:54:25.720
So that's why it was necessary.

00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:27.270
In other words the same kind of

00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:34.670
paranoia we saw in the
Emergency Detention Act

00:54:34.670 --> 00:54:36.870
and we've seen in the Patriot Act

00:54:36.870 --> 00:54:38.570
and all sorts of other activities.

00:54:40.470 --> 00:54:43.570
- [Woman] Hi, I was just wondering
whether Eleanor Roosevelt

00:54:43.570 --> 00:54:46.740
made any comments about
this in her papers?

00:54:46.740 --> 00:54:49.420
Did she argue with FDR?

00:54:49.420 --> 00:54:50.460
Was there --

00:54:50.460 --> 00:54:51.840
- No evidence of that.

00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:53.130
She accepted it.

00:54:53.130 --> 00:54:55.453
She thought it was unfortunate,

00:54:57.293 --> 00:55:00.353
and everybody was very well
traumatized in Washington.

00:55:02.447 --> 00:55:04.190
It was made worse when
a Supreme Court justice

00:55:04.190 --> 00:55:07.340
came back from Hawaii
with the false reports

00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.970
that they had been sabotaged there

00:55:08.970 --> 00:55:11.630
and that's what caused everything wrong.

00:55:11.630 --> 00:55:13.590
She did go fairly early on

00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:17.903
to visit one of the concentration camps,

00:55:17.903 --> 00:55:22.000
and wrote a few letters for individuals

00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:25.740
who were recommended to her
to help them get out of camps,

00:55:25.740 --> 00:55:27.650
but there's no evidence.

00:55:27.650 --> 00:55:28.483
We don't know.

00:55:31.560 --> 00:55:34.320
We don't know what she
may have said privately

00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.790
to her husband,

00:55:35.790 --> 00:55:39.460
but she never claimed
to have been against it,

00:55:39.460 --> 00:55:41.233
and in some of the ...

00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.010
In the introduction to a book

00:55:45.190 --> 00:55:47.520
called Beauty Beyond Barbed Wire

00:55:47.520 --> 00:55:50.240
published shortly after the war,

00:55:50.240 --> 00:55:53.830
she described it as an
unfortunate unavoidable necessity.

00:55:53.830 --> 00:55:56.208
That's not a quotation.

00:55:56.208 --> 00:55:58.423
That's a description of what she said.

00:56:00.673 --> 00:56:02.800
There's a widely held myth

00:56:02.800 --> 00:56:04.910
in the Japanese American community

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:06.740
that Eleanor Roosevelt was their champion,

00:56:06.740 --> 00:56:07.890
and it's just not true.

00:56:10.010 --> 00:56:12.880
But she did go to

00:56:15.390 --> 00:56:16.223
one of the camps.

00:56:16.223 --> 00:56:19.510
She did say things like, "I'm
sorry that you're all here."

00:56:19.510 --> 00:56:22.840
I think she was very sympathetic
and she was very, very good

00:56:22.840 --> 00:56:25.663
at projecting empathy,

00:56:27.384 --> 00:56:30.110
but that's where it ended.

00:56:30.110 --> 00:56:34.112
- I think that this
concludes our formal session.

00:56:34.112 --> 00:56:36.240
I know there are always
more questions at the end

00:56:36.240 --> 00:56:39.610
but we do have to end these events.

00:56:39.610 --> 00:56:42.677
I can't say enough, Roger,

00:56:42.677 --> 00:56:46.740
how much we appreciate our
and Judith Daniels, your wife,

00:56:46.740 --> 00:56:49.552
an awesome historian, coming to Berkeley

00:56:49.552 --> 00:56:50.500
and sharing this day with us.

00:56:50.500 --> 00:56:52.480
I should also add that Professor Daniels

00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.067
has been very generous with his time

00:56:55.067 --> 00:56:57.780
and meeting with students and faculty

00:56:57.780 --> 00:56:59.610
during his visit to our campus,

00:56:59.610 --> 00:57:02.900
so it's in a sense the model
of Jefferson lecture visit

00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.580
for us on the faculty who organize this.

00:57:06.580 --> 00:57:09.610
I want to remind you
that we have a reception

00:57:09.610 --> 00:57:14.450
planned in the back and you
are all very welcome to join.

00:57:14.450 --> 00:57:16.550
I think that Professor
Daniels will be here

00:57:16.550 --> 00:57:19.740
for at least a few
minutes to join with you.

00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:21.212
Thank you very much.

00:57:21.212 --> 00:57:24.379
(audience applauding)

00:57:26.754 --> 00:57:29.837
(lighthearted music)
