00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:03.290
You should have a good start
with Youdask A Task 2.0, but

00:00:03.290 --> 00:00:05.390
there's still quite a ways to go.

00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:08.820
And since we know you love lists,
here's another list.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.140
A list of requirements to help you keep
track of when needs to be done for

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:12.650
this project.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:17.190
We also want to remind you that in
addition to getting your code to work,

00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:20.120
don't forget to submit your reflections
describing the new features

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:23.314
of your choice that you
added to Youdask A Task 2.0
