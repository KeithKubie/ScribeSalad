00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:02.650
 My name is Tamzin. 

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:05.080
 Partner development manager in the UK and Northern Europe 

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:08.500
 I started working on mobile content since 2001. 

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.210
 I want to say that this industry is booming. 

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:13.700
 I am very excited 

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.110
 I am really happy. 

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:18.150
 See the Android ecosystem we built 

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:20.014
 Can let all partners 

00:00:20.014 --> 00:00:21.055
 Discover huge potential business opportunities from it 

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:29.520
 I think everyone has heard a lot about monetization and improvement today. 

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.870
 Obviously, profitability is not just about pricing strategies. 

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.830
 Today, everyone listened to Ellie and Michael. 

00:00:35.830 --> 00:00:38.070
 Sharing some practical tips about quality as the cornerstone of success 

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:42.010
 Tips for design 

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.740
 Also about using beta testing 

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.890
 And the secrets of platform tools such as staged release 

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:49.850
 Some of you may have participated in Matteo's interactive skills lectures. 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:54.000
 That lecture was really exciting. 

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.780
 Mainly introduce how to understand your users 

00:00:57.780 --> 00:01:02.080
 Thereby increasing engagement, retention, and understanding life cycle value 

00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:05.910
 Let's take a look 

00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:08.720
 Let’s first take a look at the current emerging business opportunities. 

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.900
 I know we talked about this earlier today. 

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:13.960
 Mark introduced you to the welcome speech. 

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:16.374
 Android platform can not ignore the development momentum 

00:01:16.374 --> 00:01:17.790
 And what I want to convey here is 

00:01:17.790 --> 00:01:21.530
 There are huge profit opportunities here. 

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.940
 And there are more and more payment methods that people can use. 

00:01:27.914 --> 00:01:29.330
 We mentioned this before. 

00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.490
 However, it is important to emphasize that the carrier issuing gift cards and local payment methods such as PayPal. 

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.612
 Can develop new target audiences for everyone 

00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.930
 In fact, I have seen such an example with my own eyes. 

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.390
 When we launched a new payment method in New Zealand 

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.960
 Really attracted a new batch of users 

00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:46.780
 And increased sales 

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.090
 This means we are indeed in New Zealand 

00:01:49.090 --> 00:01:54.490
 Found a new sales target audience for you 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:55.560
 They will buy content 

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.520
 So far, we have witnessed great success 

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.400
 Several key figures can reflect this 

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.430
 We opened up the domestic market in Germany 

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:04.530
 After we launched a new local payment method 

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:08.490
 The number of buyers has achieved 70% year-on-year growth 

00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:10.370
 Still want to share with you 

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:14.100
 Google Play’s monetization 

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:17.630
 Our main international sales 

00:02:17.630 --> 00:02:19.520
 Achieved 38% year-on-year growth 

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.380
 In this growing global market 

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:25.283
 How do you price your high-quality apps? 

00:02:25.283 --> 00:02:28.000
 Please note that I especially emphasize "high quality" because you have listened to various practical suggestions today. 

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.392
 And I believe that you will put these suggestions into action. 

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.260
 The global market is ready for your product 

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:40.160
 You have built the application and improved the application design. 

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:43.070
 And are using various platform features 

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.180
 Then, pricing for globalization is very important 

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.000
 One of my respectable colleagues, Yoshi 

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.060
 He is now debugging the microphone somewhere 

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.264
 After I finish speaking, he will discuss with you about the topic of entering the global market. 

00:02:51.264 --> 00:02:52.680
 He will give you a detailed introduction 

00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:55.130
 Other elements related to this aspect 

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:57.830
 However, I want to talk about it first. 

00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.640
 Several key points about setting and managing prices 

00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:03.580
 You might say, Tamzin, these are common sense. 

00:03:03.580 --> 00:03:05.040
 Although some of them are indeed common sense 

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.460
 But the developers who actually put these into practice are few 

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:08.100
 Less incredible 

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:10.540
 So today I want to quickly explain these key points. 

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:13.310
 If everyone thinks it is too boring, I can stop and return to my seat. 

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:16.780
 These key points include the pattern matching the market 

00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:18.770
 Consider purchasing power parity 

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:22.320
 That is, the price that consumers can afford and the local price preference. 

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.400
 As Purnima mentioned before 

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:28.490
 0.99 pricing model is not successful in Japan. This involves audience segmentation. 

00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:32.030
 You need to check your pricing strategy regularly 

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:35.720
 The first is to match the model to the market. 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:37.380
 We know that there are multiple user charging models on Google Play. 

00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:41.560
 Including free, free value added, paid, subscribed, etc. 

00:03:42.839 --> 00:03:44.380
 Therefore, it is important to ensure the pricing model 

00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.560
 With the target country 

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:50.690
 Cultural and economic factors 

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:52.030
 This is very important 

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:53.600
 If in the country you're targeting 

00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:56.450
 Prepaid is an absolute mainstream spending habit 

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:58.520
 Then the popularity of credit cards may be very low. 

00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:01.490
 At this point, you may want to consider using a payment model that is more focused on the transaction. 

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:03.260
 Such as in-app billing or payment, etc. 

00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:07.310
 And take into account the user on the phone 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.709
 The frequency of recharging may not be very high 

00:04:08.709 --> 00:04:11.250
 Of course, your pricing model should 

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.390
 Support the value proposition of your content 

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.850
 For example, if you offer a subscription service 

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:17.290
 Then make sure the content or features are updated regularly 

00:04:17.290 --> 00:04:19.570
 Or let the user have reason every day 

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:21.779
 Come back to get more value 

00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:28.400
 Has anyone heard that we have lowered the minimum price in India? 

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.930
 Please raise your hand 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:31.850
 well 

00:04:31.850 --> 00:04:35.290
 Does anyone really lower the price and enter the Indian market? 

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:36.800
 awesome 

00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:38.550
 I really want to send you a fruit basket. 

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.580
 This is the case, we have recently lowered 

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:44.260
 Lower limit for developers in the Google Play India Edition store 

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:47.490
 From 50 rupees to 10 rupees 

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.160
 Now let me explain the background of doing this. 

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.780
 I can see that a can of Coke is about 10 rupees in India. 

00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:54.460
 But the price in the US is $1. 

00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:57.070
 That's right, that's it. 

00:04:57.070 --> 00:05:00.990
 But actually we all know 

00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:05.022
 If you press yesterday’s exchange rate, $1 is equivalent to 66 rupees. 

00:05:05.022 --> 00:05:06.480
 That is 

00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:11.117
 The price of a can of cola in India is 10 rupees in the United States and the price is 66 rupees. 

00:05:11.117 --> 00:05:12.950
 From this example we can easily see 

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.690
 Coca-Cola is actually based on the purchasing power of the market. 

00:05:17.690 --> 00:05:19.820
 That is, purchasing power parity to determine the price 

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:21.810
 Well, this example tells us 

00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.140
 Although there is a market exchange rate 

00:05:24.140 --> 00:05:26.490
 But there is always a price that is flexible according to the consumer’s price. 

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:28.920
 Can bring you more conversions 

00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:32.890
 Just four weeks after we lowered the minimum price 

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.640
 We saw some results 

00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.849
 220 developers targeting India 

00:05:38.849 --> 00:05:40.140
 Adjusted the price of 560 products 

00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:43.550
 So, this gentleman, you are one of the 220 developers. 

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:47.470
 In the end, these developers’ revenues increased by 800%. 

00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:48.965
 The effect is very good 

00:05:48.965 --> 00:05:50.840
 In addition, it is worth mentioning that 

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.850
 Is your company in India or in the UK? 

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:55.390
 Oh, in the UK 

00:05:55.390 --> 00:05:59.700
 That's right, 75% of the 220 developers are not in India. 

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:02.490
 But it has adjusted the price for the Indian market, including you 

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:07.840
 It can be seen that this is a highly international market. We are very happy to see this situation. 

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.840
 I especially want to share with you the practice of Nova. 

00:06:09.840 --> 00:06:13.390
 Nova's product is a browser launcher 

00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:17.380
 Its original price is $4.99 

00:06:17.380 --> 00:06:21.260
 Equivalent to around 325 rupees 

00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.050
 That is the price of 32 cans of cola 

00:06:24.050 --> 00:06:26.010
 They use this promotion 

00:06:26.010 --> 00:06:30.040
 Adjusted the price, I remember it is 15 rupees 

00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:32.030
 On this chart we can see the effect of the adjustment 

00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:37.990
 Order volume increased by 136% and revenue increased by 27% 

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.420
 The effect is proven again, and the developer is happy too. 

00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:43.190
 Yes, this offer is still going on, if you are interested 

00:06:43.190 --> 00:06:45.690
 And hope to enter India, it is recommended to seize this opportunity 

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:51.380
 We know many of our top partners 

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.180
 All of them carry out price tests on their own 

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:00.720
 Recently, an excellent learning app 

00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:03.170
 Made some ABCD tests in the US and Russia 

00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:05.420
 They found 

00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.420
 After testing four different price points for the US 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:11.130
 The best price is 23% lower than the original price 

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:14.310
 But the conversion rate has increased by 95%. 

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:18.350
 ARPU increased by 52% 

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:22.430
 The test results for Russia are similar, the price needs to be lowered by 12%. 

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:24.510
 Everyone can see the relevant statistics on the screen. 

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:27.330
 It is important to note that there is no need to apply their results. 

00:07:27.330 --> 00:07:30.760
 Because your content is unique 

00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.140
 You also have your own target market 

00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:36.070
 But if you want to find a way 

00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:38.386
 Test different prices for the target market 

00:07:38.386 --> 00:07:40.010
 I can use this method to find the best price. 

00:07:40.010 --> 00:07:43.540
 To help you increase your conversion rate and get more 

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:50.250
 The following questions to be discussed are mentioned earlier. 

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:54.490
 I am from Australia, not New Zealand. 

00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:56.310
 Something makes me very upset 

00:07:56.310 --> 00:07:59.410
 I am going to the Play Store to find an app. 

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:00.220
 Finally found the favorite application 

00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:01.170
 not bad 

00:08:01.170 --> 00:08:04.665
 At this point the system shows that I need to pay 1.16 or 3.74 US dollars. 

00:08:04.665 --> 00:08:06.140
 I feel, oh 

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:09.840
 I feel that developers don't care about this user. 

00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:11.440
 We introduced before 

00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.650
 In Japan, people like integers, such as 700 yen. 

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:18.090
 Do not like 701 yen 

00:08:18.090 --> 00:08:20.350
 So in the developer console 

00:08:20.350 --> 00:08:24.180
 We allow the price of in-app SKUs to be customized by country 

00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:29.000
 Paid price or subscription price 

00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:31.360
 The most intimate thing is that after you set the price 

00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:33.355
 We will convert the price to local currency 

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.729
 This way, when the user sees the optimized price 

00:08:37.729 --> 00:08:39.270
 And when it comes to their valuable products 

00:08:39.270 --> 00:08:42.319
 If they like the content, they are more likely to buy 

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:50.110
 Has anyone attended the interactive skills lectures of Matteo? 

00:08:50.110 --> 00:08:50.850
 very good! 

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:53.840
 It seems that everyone is familiar with this. 

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:55.340
 But I have to talk about this topic again. 

00:08:55.340 --> 00:08:57.380
 Because the degree of interaction is very important 

00:08:57.380 --> 00:09:02.160
 As we all know, no two users are the same. 

00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:04.630
 So you better know who your customers are. 

00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:07.734
 Their behavioral characteristics are what they will pay for what they buy. 

00:09:07.734 --> 00:09:10.150
 With this information in place, you can develop different strategies. 

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.410
 Helping users during their shopping 

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:15.910
 Matteo talks a lot about Google Analytics. 

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.830
 In fact, all analysis tools are important 

00:09:17.830 --> 00:09:19.370
 In fact, if you have a way 

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:22.170
 Segment customers 

00:09:22.170 --> 00:09:25.205
 Find out who will spend money on shopping and who will not spend money on shopping 

00:09:25.205 --> 00:09:27.170
 Who is happy to interact and who are not willing to participate in the interaction 

00:09:27.170 --> 00:09:29.360
 Then offer them different products or services 

00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:30.840
 It will be a great success. There are so many examples. 

00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.660
 For example, Wish uses this method. 

00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:38.560
 Some of you have not heard of Matteo’s speech. Therefore, I will give a general introduction here. 

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.810
 Wish took some steps to increase conversion rate 

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.030
 Mainly to provide different product combinations 

00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:46.675
 Provide cheaper products for less interactive users 

00:09:46.675 --> 00:09:48.550
 Offer more expensive products to users with higher levels of interaction 

00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.430
 Is anyone here selling products to Russia? 

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:55.150
 There are some 

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:57.470
 Then you may be familiar with this picture. 

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.905
 However, a best practice to mention at the end of any pricing method is 

00:10:00.905 --> 00:10:03.280
 Check pricing regularly, this is fundamental 

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:07.700
 For example, if a developer 

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:11.564
 No adjustments were made within one year after the price was set on February 1, 2014 

00:10:11.564 --> 00:10:13.230
 Then he will find his total income in Russia. 

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:16.911
 Almost half cut because the exchange rate has changed 

00:10:16.911 --> 00:10:19.410
 Therefore, we recommend that you regularly check to see if pricing is reasonable. 

00:10:19.410 --> 00:10:22.770
 For example, is your pricing appropriate compared to your competitors? 

00:10:22.770 --> 00:10:26.310
 After the exchange rate changes, is your pricing appropriate? 

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:29.190
 These are all the best practices I want to introduce. 

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.080
 I am speaking a bit slower. Now I have to go to the next topic. 

00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.320
 This theme is 

00:10:34.320 --> 00:10:34.930
 No two users are the same 

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:37.110
 They have different price sensitivities 

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.500
 Have different needs 

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.410
 When you enter the global market 

00:10:40.410 --> 00:10:42.250
 How to deal with this situation? 

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:44.050
 So next I will talk about AdMob 

00:10:44.050 --> 00:10:46.340
 Then I will introduce you a little more. 

00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.381
 Our latest updates on subscriptions 

00:10:50.556 --> 00:10:52.440
 Remote control, give a little force 

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.960
 Is anyone using AdMob here? 

00:10:54.960 --> 00:10:57.030
 If not used, I will not be disappointed. 

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:57.967
 well! Great! 

00:10:57.967 --> 00:10:59.800
 I will introduce AdMob first, which is convenient for the audience who have never used it. 

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.630
 AdMob is our industry-leading advertising and mediation platform 

00:11:02.630 --> 00:11:06.510
 In the past two years, it has helped more than 650,000 developers 

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.780
 Earned more than $1 billion in revenue 

00:11:09.780 --> 00:11:11.860
 Everyone can see here 

00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.270
 All aspects of growth are amazing 

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:15.840
 These numbers reflect some of AdMob's situation. 

00:11:15.840 --> 00:11:18.200
 But actually it reflects the situation of the entire ecosystem. 

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:20.130
 As can be seen from these figures 

00:11:20.130 --> 00:11:22.410
 Advertising is a very important way to profit 

00:11:22.410 --> 00:11:24.140
 And growing every year 

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:25.880
 In fact, Gartner had predicted 

00:11:25.880 --> 00:11:30.050
 This is Gartner's chart by 2017, and the number of app downloads will be close to 270 billion. 

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.860
 They think that most apps download 

00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.320
 Will use free, paid or free value-added models 

00:11:35.320 --> 00:11:37.730
 Development of freemium model 

00:11:37.730 --> 00:11:40.937
 No doubt means the development of mobile advertising 

00:11:40.937 --> 00:11:42.520
 We have discussed 

00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:45.380
 Due to discrepancies between disposable income and culture 

00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:46.920
 Consumers in different markets have different behaviors 

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.110
 But we think that developers should not be allowed 

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.610
 Only monetize with in-app ads 

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:55.360
 Or can only monetize with ads 

00:11:55.360 --> 00:12:00.970
 However, we have not provided this option to developers. 

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.490
 Until we launched AdMob 

00:12:02.490 --> 00:12:05.420
 AdMob is designed to help you find 

00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:07.570
 Appropriate profit model 

00:12:07.570 --> 00:12:10.420
 It provides a lot of opportunities to process information 

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:14.150
 Watch your apps, users, and advertisers 

00:12:14.150 --> 00:12:16.880
 Then provide them with the right experience 

00:12:16.880 --> 00:12:23.600
 In a nutshell, this means you can make settings in your app. 

00:12:23.600 --> 00:12:27.810
 In this way, we judge users who like to consume 

00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:30.630
 Will see in-app purchase ads in your products 

00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:32.860
 And those of us who don’t like spending 

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.230
 Only see AdMob ads or third-party ads of your choice 

00:12:37.230 --> 00:12:39.990
 We try to help you monetize all users in this way. 

00:12:39.990 --> 00:12:41.872
 Not only rely on users who like to spend 

00:12:41.872 --> 00:12:42.830
 Not limited to users who don’t like spending 

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.560
 This is another tool in the audience building tool AdMob. 

00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.560
 Use this tool to gain insight 

00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.450
 And create more granular audience segments. 

00:12:56.450 --> 00:12:58.010
 Thereby offering them different products/services 

00:12:58.010 --> 00:13:01.050
 Let's say if you have some users who are happy to spend money on your products. 

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.790
 Then you may not want to show ads to them at all. 

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.610
 The AdMob platform will let you do this. 

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:11.550
 So in-app purchases and advertising are two great ways to monetize. 

00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.090
 But there is another way to make money. 

00:13:13.090 --> 00:13:16.730
 Does anyone here like to continue to earn income? 

00:13:16.730 --> 00:13:17.580
 very good! 

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:20.460
 So, let me introduce you to the subscription. 

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:24.990
 Ask another question, who has a Netflix account? 

00:13:24.990 --> 00:13:26.040
 awesome 

00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.917
 Who is using the mobile phone package? 

00:13:28.917 --> 00:13:30.500
 Everyone can see 

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:33.280
 Subscribing to this mode has proven that users are used to it and like this model very much. 

00:13:33.904 --> 00:13:36.320
 From the user's point of view, this mode makes people very comfortable 

00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:37.140
 Because there is no unplanned cost 

00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:38.710
 After user registration 

00:13:38.710 --> 00:13:41.810
 You can continue to enjoy the content for free 

00:13:41.810 --> 00:13:44.820
 In addition, users can build trust in the brand. 

00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:46.500
 For developers 

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.700
 Continuous income will make you more confident about cash flow 

00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.420
 And help estimate the investment on Android 

00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:54.870
 Do you know? 

00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.560
 Subscription is the fastest growing business model on Play 

00:13:57.560 --> 00:13:58.920
 It can be seen from the statistics here. 

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:01.660
 2013 to 2014 

00:14:01.660 --> 00:14:05.670
 Subscription model has increased by 2.5 times 

00:14:05.670 --> 00:14:07.681
 We think this is because of two factors 

00:14:07.681 --> 00:14:09.930
 The first factor is 

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:10.950
 People are getting used to paying for apps and content 

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.462
 The second factor is the top developer 

00:14:13.462 --> 00:14:15.920
 For example, everyone here, constantly improving 

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:17.440
 The quality of the apps you launch in the Play Store 

00:14:17.440 --> 00:14:20.647
 So thank you very much 

00:14:20.647 --> 00:14:22.230
 I have timed out 

00:14:22.230 --> 00:14:25.090
 So I will introduce a few cases, the first one is Busuu 

00:14:25.090 --> 00:14:28.930
 This is a very good partner for us. 

00:14:28.930 --> 00:14:31.120
 Last year, they were on their Android apps. 

00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:32.210
 Put a lot of money 

00:14:32.210 --> 00:14:35.390
 Their focus has always been on improving the user's ability to get started. 

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:38.280
 The purpose is to attract users to sign up for subscription services. 

00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:41.260
 They completely modified their designs 

00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:44.490
 Enable users to actually see 

00:14:44.490 --> 00:14:45.850
 Value that can be obtained after registration 

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:47.330
 Many of them are free 

00:14:47.330 --> 00:14:51.690
 Ending is a call to action 

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:54.580
 In addition, I have to say that the New York Times is awesome. 

00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:56.700
 They used to use the paywall mechanism 

00:14:56.700 --> 00:14:58.080
 Now transitioning to the Google Play billing platform 

00:14:58.080 --> 00:14:59.950
 The time they need to register the user 

00:14:59.950 --> 00:15:03.330
 Reduced from two minutes to only three seconds 

00:15:03.330 --> 00:15:06.600
 The reason why registration speed is so fast is because 

00:15:06.600 --> 00:15:08.750
 All logged in users 

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:12.920
 There is already a payment method in the Play Store. 

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:15.120
 Thanks to the simplification of this 

00:15:15.120 --> 00:15:18.490
 Subscription conversion rate increased by 125% 

00:15:18.490 --> 00:15:19.970
 so 

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:22.380
 You can use a lot of features to build a successful subscription business 

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:25.680
 The grace period mechanism we provide is very useful to allow users who have run out of time to recharge their time. 

00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:27.980
 Because the user may be using a prepaid top payment method 

00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:30.970
 Carrier billing function may be a problem for a while 

00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:33.350
 Or the user did not pay their credit card bill 

00:15:34.590 --> 00:15:37.170
 In general, the grace period gives users a chance 

00:15:37.170 --> 00:15:40.200
 Let them resolve payment issues without unsubscribing 

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:42.350
 This is not only beneficial to the user, but also beneficial to you. 

00:15:42.350 --> 00:15:44.150
 Because this will reduce the customer churn rate 

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:48.020
 To reward customers who provide practical feedback 

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:49.520
 Quality customer credit is a very effective mechanism 

00:15:49.520 --> 00:15:51.930
 And upgrading and downgrading is another 

00:15:51.930 --> 00:15:57.020
 A means to help users easily complete a purchase or ARPU journey 

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.520
 The next slide 

00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:00.000
 I am most eager to share with you today. 

00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.690
 But what excites me even more is 

00:16:01.690 --> 00:16:03.540
 starting from tomorrow 

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:06.296
 We will launch a quarterly and semi-annual subscription period. 

00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:15.720
 This allows you to achieve many different goals in the past 

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:17.920
 The first is to use psychological principles to price 

00:16:17.920 --> 00:16:20.756
 You can adjust the pricing method of the product 

00:16:20.756 --> 00:16:22.380
 Subscribe for six months compared to one quarter 

00:16:22.380 --> 00:16:25.790
 The former is more attractive to users 

00:16:25.790 --> 00:16:28.250
 Again, we hope that this way 

00:16:28.250 --> 00:16:33.110
 Give you more flexibility in terms of monetization 

00:16:33.110 --> 00:16:34.660
 Thank you very much! 

00:16:34.660 --> 00:16:35.710
 I am overtime, I am very sorry. 

00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:38.560
 But I still have to summarize 

00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:40.065
 First, Google Play is a growing market. 

00:16:40.065 --> 00:16:42.530
 I think we have said it many times today. 

00:16:42.530 --> 00:16:45.100
 Pricing is a booster for profit 

00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:48.630
 But quality is one of the key factors we have to consider. 

00:16:48.630 --> 00:16:52.640
 Follow some best practices and you can succeed 

00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.700
 Please think about the subscription model you can use now. 

00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:56.530
 thank you all 

00:16:56.530 --> 00:16:57.730
 [applause] 

00:16:57.730 --> 00:17:04.980
