00:00:02.604 --> 00:00:03.840
BRADY HARAN: A pretend
conversation.

00:00:03.840 --> 00:00:05.585
Like, you know when you watch
TV and the weather presenter

00:00:05.585 --> 00:00:07.810
and the news presenter have
that fake chat at the end?

00:00:07.810 --> 00:00:08.615
JAMES GRIME: Oh, OK.

00:00:08.615 --> 00:00:09.590
[INAUDIBLE].

00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:10.490
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, OK.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.390
Interesting.

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:12.890
That's an interesting
equation you were

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:14.534
telling me about earlier.

00:00:14.534 --> 00:00:15.350
JAMES GRIME: It was?

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.235
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:00:16.235 --> 00:00:17.160
Hello, everyone.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:18.130
The camera's there.

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:19.290
We mustn't look at ourselves.

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:20.920
Hello, everyone.

00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:25.010
I'm Brady from "Numberphile",
and this is Dr. James Grime.

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:26.320
JAMES GRIME: Hello.

00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.130
BRADY HARAN: James is in loads
of "Numberphile" videos.

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.680
He's the most frequent guest.

00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:32.920
JAMES GRIME: Can't
get rid of me.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.250
BRADY HARAN: Can't
get rid of you.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:34.190
JAMES GRIME: Bad penny.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:36.070
BRADY HARAN: One of our most
popular guests as well.

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:38.280
And I know a lot of people
were really interested

00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:39.210
to hear from him.

00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:43.370
We've been filming upstairs at
"Numberphile" HQ, making about

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:44.820
five or six videos, we did?

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:46.010
JAMES GRIME: Yes,
I think we did.

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.060
BRADY HARAN: About five or six
videos that we've recorded,

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.550
which will be appearing on
"Numberphile" in the weeks and

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:51.290
months to come.

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:55.270
But while James was here, as I
told many of you yesterday, I

00:00:55.270 --> 00:00:58.200
thought I would take advantage
of the fact he was here on

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.140
Valentine's Day.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.910
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, isn't it a
bit odd that we're spending

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:04.390
Valentine's Day together?

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:07.150
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, it was an
unfortunate scheduling.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:08.520
It was the only day
you were free.

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:09.850
JAMES GRIME: What do you
mean unfortunate?

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.950
And what do you mean it's
the only day I'm free?

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:13.210
BRADY HARAN: That wasn't
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:13.210 --> 00:01:14.630
JAMES GRIME: This is
going downhill.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:16.760
BRADY HARAN: Let's stop
that altogether.

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.930
Let's talk to James about the
things you want to talk about.

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:22.810
A bunch of people posted
questions yesterday.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.410
So I'm going to ask a few of
them, so those people have a

00:01:25.410 --> 00:01:27.580
chance to be involved, in
case they're not here.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:29.830
And obviously you can post
questions yourselves now.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:31.855
We'll be following it, and I'll
try and get some of them

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:33.530
to James as well.

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.740
The first thing I thought we
should deal with is, I know a

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:39.170
lot of people may be aware--
some people may not be aware--

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:41.030
that James has his own
YouTube channel.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:42.290
He's been doing this
far longer than

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:43.920
"Numberphile" has existed.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.460
It's called singingbanana.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:46.830
JAMES GRIME: Course it is.

00:01:46.830 --> 00:01:48.300
BRADY HARAN: I don't want to
talk about it too much,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:50.640
because I would rather you all
watched my channels than

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:51.480
James' channel.

00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:54.120
But a lot of you asked
about it, so I'm not

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.920
going to ignore it.

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.510
And it's full of excellent
stuff.

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.760
There were three things that
came up most frequently.

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:02.470
The first thing people want to
know is why your channel's

00:02:02.470 --> 00:02:04.190
called singingbanana.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:07.160
And then can you also tell us a
bit about the future of it?

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:09.470
Because obviously, with all your
commitments, it's a bit

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.039
more sporadic in
its uploading.

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.070
What's happening with it?

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:13.500
What's the status of it?

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:16.920
And lastly, a lot of people have
asked, as you do that and

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:20.165
I do my things on YouTube, how
did we come to meet via?

00:02:20.165 --> 00:02:21.720
And so can you tell
people about it?

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.590
I mean, I know the answer to
that question, but if you can

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:25.820
tell people those
three things.

00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:26.090
JAMES GRIME: OK.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.200
So I do have my own YouTube
channel, singingbanana.

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:29.900
Of course it is.

00:02:29.900 --> 00:02:31.526
Why wouldn't it be called
singingbanana?

00:02:31.526 --> 00:02:35.750
No, singingbanana is my online
name, and it has been since I

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:37.300
was, like, 17.

00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.070
So--

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.690
oh, by the way, if you search
singingbanana, if you find

00:02:40.690 --> 00:02:43.520
another singingbanana online,
don't harass them, because it

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:44.270
might not be me.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.580
I know there's some other people
who have decided those

00:02:46.580 --> 00:02:49.300
two words together
would be fun.

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.510
But it's my online name.

00:02:50.510 --> 00:02:54.360
So my channel wasn't meant to
be anything more than my

00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:56.370
personal YouTube channel.

00:02:56.370 --> 00:02:59.935
So that's why it's called
singingbanana.

00:02:59.935 --> 00:03:02.700
I've been doing it for five
years now, in March.

00:03:02.700 --> 00:03:05.050
It will be my fifth year,
measuring from

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.670
my first maths video.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:09.340
What were the other questions
I was asked?

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.740
BRADY HARAN: You were asked
about your future for it.

00:03:11.740 --> 00:03:12.820
What's the situation
about that?

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.520
Because you obviously have a
lot of things on the go.

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:16.410
JAMES GRIME: So I do it
in my spare time.

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:20.360
I don't want people thinking
that I do this for a living.

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:22.110
So the YouTube stuff--

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:22.860
BRADY HARAN: As opposed to me.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.830
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, exactly.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:24.960
Exactly right.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.080
So my YouTube stuff is
in my free time.

00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:33.230
And the more I do public talks
and the more traveling I do,

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:38.340
and the more "Numberphile" I do,
unfortunately it affects

00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:41.360
my singingbanana schedule,
which is a shame.

00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:42.820
And I don't like that either.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:46.980
And I want to do as many
as I can, as I can.

00:03:46.980 --> 00:03:47.735
What was the other question?

00:03:47.735 --> 00:03:48.550
There was one other.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:49.940
BRADY HARAN: How you
were doing that.

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:50.150
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:03:50.150 --> 00:03:51.660
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, how did you
come to be involved with

00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:52.200
"Numberphile"?

00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:54.710
JAMES GRIME: Well, I know, in
the first case, I was a fan of

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:56.610
periodic videos.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.740
So I saw what you were doing for
chemistry, and I wanted to

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.610
do something like
that for maths.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:05.950
I tried to sort of do it
on singingbanana, in

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.970
my own small way.

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:11.930
And if you go back to an old
singingbanana video, there's

00:04:11.930 --> 00:04:13.910
even on where I recommend
channels.

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:17.649
And I recommend "Periodic
Videos." And I actually say,

00:04:17.649 --> 00:04:20.860
Brady's doing for chemistry what
I want to do for maths.

00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:23.150
So that's actually there.

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.500
And so--

00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:25.150
BRADY HARAN: Now I'm doing
for maths what you

00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:25.860
want to do for maths.

00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:26.350
JAMES GRIME: Right.

00:04:26.350 --> 00:04:26.980
BRADY HARAN: With you.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:27.640
JAMES GRIME: Well,
yeah, exactly.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:29.020
This is brilliant.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.520
And I was a big fan of your
"Bibledex" channel as well,

00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:37.650
which was about each book of
the Bible, because that's

00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:39.030
something I don't know about.

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:41.885
Chemistry, physics,
I kind of know.

00:04:41.885 --> 00:04:43.580
And that's something
that I didn't know

00:04:43.580 --> 00:04:44.990
anything about at all.

00:04:44.990 --> 00:04:47.350
So I was fascinated
by those videos,

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:50.120
like an ordinary viewer.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.390
And I sent you a couple of nice
messages, I think, saying

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.460
I'm loving this channel.

00:04:53.460 --> 00:04:54.270
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.215
JAMES GRIME: And if you ever
think of doing maths,

00:04:56.215 --> 00:04:58.110
ask me about it.

00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:01.100
And so that opportunity
came up, and you did.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:01.540
BRADY HARAN: I did.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.880
JAMES GRIME: You asked
me about it.

00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:03.890
BRADY HARAN: I did.

00:05:03.890 --> 00:05:05.180
We went to the pub, didn't we?

00:05:05.180 --> 00:05:06.580
And I said, I'm gonna
do a maths channel.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.130
What do you think?

00:05:07.130 --> 00:05:09.810
And you were on board.

00:05:09.810 --> 00:05:10.800
Worst thing you ever did.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:11.516
You can't get rid of me now.

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:13.350
JAMES GRIME: No, or the
other way around.

00:05:13.350 --> 00:05:14.690
BRADY HARAN: Well, no.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.730
We're very glad to have
you in our videos.

00:05:16.730 --> 00:05:17.810
A few other questions.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.320
There are loads coming
in, so we'll try and

00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:20.390
get to some of those.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:23.665
Someone asked, are we both
redheads, or is there strange

00:05:23.665 --> 00:05:24.210
lighting in the room?

00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:26.440
JAMES GRIME: Look, this
is not ginger.

00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.160
This is brown.

00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:28.980
Look at my eyebrow.

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:32.960
This is brown with blonde parts
in it, that it just

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.910
comes out a little big rusty.

00:05:34.910 --> 00:05:35.910
Yeah, it's--

00:05:35.910 --> 00:05:37.540
BRADY HARAN: Someone else
has asked where

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.250
your accent is from.

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.590
JAMES GRIME: My accent is
Nottingham, because I'm from

00:05:41.590 --> 00:05:42.700
Nottingham originally.

00:05:42.700 --> 00:05:45.050
BRADY HARAN: [INAUDIBLE], for
those who don't know, I'm

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:45.890
based in Nottingham.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:47.790
That's where I work
on "Numberphile".

00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:49.580
James actually lives
in Cambridge now.

00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:50.050
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:51.630
BRADY HARAN: But you are in
Nottingham today [INAUDIBLE].

00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:54.225
JAMES GRIME: I am born
and bred Nottingham.

00:05:54.225 --> 00:05:58.230
And I left when I was 17.

00:05:58.230 --> 00:05:59.260
But I am.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:00.365
This is a midlands accent.

00:06:00.365 --> 00:06:05.270
It's a fairly neutral accent,
maybe on the slightly northern

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:06.450
side of things.

00:06:06.450 --> 00:06:08.110
BRADY HARAN: And if anyone's
really confused, because I

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:10.750
said I live in Nottingham, I am
from Australia originally.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:12.780
I don't have a Nottingham
accent.

00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:14.860
We had quite a few questions.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.870
People asked a lot about
your background.

00:06:16.870 --> 00:06:19.600
But in particular, quite a few
people have asked about what

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:21.220
you did for your PhD.

00:06:21.220 --> 00:06:22.380
You obviously have a PhD.

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.480
Can you tell us a little bit
about your research, what your

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:25.730
hardcore math was?

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.950
JAMES GRIME: Right.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:30.370
So my PhD, if I start off in
broad terms, it was about

00:06:30.370 --> 00:06:32.040
something called group theory.

00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:35.020
Group theory is part of maths,
which is about symmetry.

00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:36.470
So it's the maths of symmetry.

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:40.460
So if you imagine a square, like
that, and if I rotate the

00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:43.260
square a quarter-turn, you
get a square again.

00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.990
So that's like ordinary
symmetry.

00:06:45.990 --> 00:06:49.820
If you flipped the square,
you get a square again.

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.700
If I rotate the square four
quarter-turns, I get back to

00:06:53.700 --> 00:06:55.380
where I started, so
things like that.

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:57.750
That's the symmetry
of a square.

00:06:57.750 --> 00:07:02.130
But mathematically speaking,
symmetry covers a lot of sins.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.700
Symmetry means, there's
something we care about that

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.400
we want to stay the same.

00:07:06.400 --> 00:07:07.700
So it might be a shape.

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:11.140
It might be volume or
length or angle.

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:12.510
There's something we
care about that we

00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:13.390
want to stay the same.

00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:14.505
That's group theory.

00:07:14.505 --> 00:07:17.190
And my PhD was about
group theory.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:20.610
And it was about turning groups,
which is an abstract

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:24.580
thing, into matrices, which
is a concrete thing.

00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:27.600
And it's about making a bridge
between those worlds.

00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.240
There you go.

00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:28.860
That's a start.

00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:30.625
That's the start of my PhD.

00:07:30.625 --> 00:07:33.620
And we could go much
deeper than that.

00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.940
BRADY HARAN: Well, we might come
back to it depending on

00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:37.080
what everyone asks about.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:38.400
I'll ask you a couple
other things from

00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:40.890
yesterday, and loads of--

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:42.435
what were your favorite
school subjects?

00:07:42.435 --> 00:07:44.340
Were you into mathematics
at school?

00:07:44.340 --> 00:07:47.490
JAMES GRIME: So at school,
I tell you what,

00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:48.810
when I did my A-levels--

00:07:48.810 --> 00:07:52.600
so that's when you do, 17 to
18 years old, you start to

00:07:52.600 --> 00:07:56.210
pick A-levels in the UK.

00:07:56.210 --> 00:08:00.080
I picked maths, physics,
and chemistry.

00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:03.590
Now, maths and physics I picked
because I'm lazy.

00:08:03.590 --> 00:08:07.780
Those are the subjects that
were easiest for me to do.

00:08:07.780 --> 00:08:09.530
Actually, I wasn't
gonna do maths.

00:08:09.530 --> 00:08:11.720
My maths teacher
made me do it.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:12.965
He said, you are doing maths.

00:08:12.965 --> 00:08:14.050
I said, I don't want
to do maths.

00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:16.230
He said, you are doing maths.

00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:20.260
So I picked maths, physics,
chemistry.

00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:23.280
Chemistry was the one I found
hardest but fascinating.

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:26.350
I was absolutely fascinated
with chemistry.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.510
90% of my time was spent
trying to keep up with

00:08:29.510 --> 00:08:32.559
chemistry, because it was the
one I found hardest to do.

00:08:32.559 --> 00:08:35.000
And then 10% of my time was
doing maths and physics,

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.950
because it came naturally
to me.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:40.390
So the answer is, I'm
slightly lazy.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.140
I picked the subject that came
most naturally to me.

00:08:44.140 --> 00:08:45.680
But then I continued to do it.

00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:50.030
And at university, that's when
I really started to see the

00:08:50.030 --> 00:08:53.220
beauty of mathematics, because
real mathematics that I care

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:55.390
about is about proof.

00:08:55.390 --> 00:08:57.610
And that's what you get
to do at university.

00:08:57.610 --> 00:09:00.640
That's when you start to be
really creative about

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.100
mathematics.

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.160
That's why I continue
to do it.

00:09:04.160 --> 00:09:05.540
It's the proof.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:06.795
Proof is [INAUDIBLE].

00:09:06.795 --> 00:09:08.460
BRADY HARAN: Well, funny you
should say that, because a

00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.620
question that's just come in
recently is, what mathematical

00:09:12.620 --> 00:09:15.610
proof is most surprising
to you, or maybe just

00:09:15.610 --> 00:09:15.990
interesting?

00:09:15.990 --> 00:09:19.890
Can you talk about a proof that
is worth talking about?

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:22.960
We did a video about a proof
today, didn't we?

00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:24.360
But maybe we can keep
that one a secret.

00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:26.540
JAMES GRIME: OK, so I'm
gonna have to keep up

00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:28.030
with the site then.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:29.420
What mathematical proof?

00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:32.410
There are some things that
are counter-intuitive.

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.250
And so those are fascinating,
the ones

00:09:34.250 --> 00:09:35.370
that you don't expect.

00:09:35.370 --> 00:09:39.870
Now, those are fascinating
because those are peculiar.

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.800
Maths is intuitive.

00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:43.590
And I want people to
understand that.

00:09:43.590 --> 00:09:45.410
Maths is an intuitive subject.

00:09:45.410 --> 00:09:48.000
What you believe to be
true, more often than

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.495
not, actually is true.

00:09:49.495 --> 00:09:51.340
And that's how maths work.

00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:55.530
Mathematicians are not just
working through the steps.

00:09:55.530 --> 00:09:57.030
They are actually
making creative

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:58.915
leaps, creative jumps.

00:09:58.915 --> 00:10:00.340
This is how it should work.

00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:02.640
This is how it should
be, so now I have to

00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:04.680
prove that it is.

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:08.570
So you're using your intuition
to guide you.

00:10:08.570 --> 00:10:13.160
So the majority of maths is
intuitive in that sense.

00:10:13.160 --> 00:10:16.520
So when you get the
counter-intuitive ones, that's

00:10:16.520 --> 00:10:19.190
why mathematicians like
talking about them.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:21.650
I don't want to give people
the wrong idea that that's

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:22.930
what maths is.

00:10:22.930 --> 00:10:27.190
But then you get problems like
the Monty Hall problem, which

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:30.255
is a game show where you
have three doors.

00:10:30.255 --> 00:10:33.710
You have to pick the car, and
then the game show host

00:10:33.710 --> 00:10:34.480
reveals one of the doors.

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.770
You've got two doors left.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:39.930
And if you change your mind,
you're twice as likely to win.

00:10:39.930 --> 00:10:42.720
And that's very

00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:44.900
counter-intuitive, very bizarre.

00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:48.310
And then you can prove
that that is true.

00:10:48.310 --> 00:10:50.670
Mathematicians like to talk
about those strange ones.

00:10:50.670 --> 00:10:52.400
BRADY HARAN: I do want to do
that for "Numberphile", but

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.520
it's one of those things
that's been

00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.820
done so many times.

00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:57.220
I want to do it in a new way,
and I haven't decided how

00:10:57.220 --> 00:10:57.660
we're gonna do it yet.

00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.140
JAMES GRIME: It's famous, and
it's famous for a reason,

00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:01.310
because it's good.

00:11:01.310 --> 00:11:03.030
And you actually learn
something.

00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:04.148
When you start to see the proof,
you actually learn

00:11:04.148 --> 00:11:05.398
something from that.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.540
BRADY HARAN: You talked before
about A-levels in school.

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:12.040
Someone's asked here what grades
you got in A-levels.

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.210
Where were your high
school maths like?

00:11:14.210 --> 00:11:16.495
JAMES GRIME: Well, you know
what it's going to be.

00:11:16.495 --> 00:11:17.825
You know it's gonna be A's.

00:11:17.825 --> 00:11:20.250
Yes, I got A's at A-level.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.680
In my day-- where's my pipe?

00:11:22.680 --> 00:11:25.325
In my day, we didn't have
A-stars or A-levels, so I had

00:11:25.325 --> 00:11:26.880
A's for A-levels.

00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.690
BRADY HARAN: OK, and
a few people have

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:29.680
asked about your IQ.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:32.010
Have you ever had an IQ test?

00:11:32.010 --> 00:11:33.085
JAMES GRIME: I have, yes.

00:11:33.085 --> 00:11:34.340
BRADY HARAN: What'd you get?

00:11:34.340 --> 00:11:36.486
What's your number?

00:11:36.486 --> 00:11:40.230
JAMES GRIME: So IQ, OK,
I will do this.

00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.950
However, IQ is not a good
measure of intelligence.

00:11:43.950 --> 00:11:44.610
And I'm--

00:11:44.610 --> 00:11:45.100
BRADY HARAN: Oh, you bombed.

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:45.690
Yeah, you bombed out.

00:11:45.690 --> 00:11:47.760
JAMES GRIME: I'm not
a big fan of it.

00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.260
My IQ, when I was 16, when
I had it tested, was 155.

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:53.860
BRADY HARAN: That's really
high, isn't it?

00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.175
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:11:54.175 --> 00:11:56.740
It would put me in the
top something, yes.

00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:57.820
BRADY HARAN: 155.

00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.130
JAMES GRIME: And I don't care,
because I'm still an idiot.

00:12:01.130 --> 00:12:04.320
BRADY HARAN: If my IQ was 155,
I'd have it tattooed on my

00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:05.780
forehead, but anyway.

00:12:05.780 --> 00:12:07.470
JAMES GRIME: I never want
to mention that again.

00:12:07.470 --> 00:12:09.480
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:11.880
I'll ask you a few random ones,
just because I like

00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:12.460
questions like this.

00:12:12.460 --> 00:12:12.730
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, go on.

00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:14.700
BRADY HARAN: Someone asked,
do you have a favorite

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.250
mathematical symbol?

00:12:16.250 --> 00:12:18.220
And is there a mathematical
symbol you'd like to change

00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:18.790
for some reason?

00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:20.910
I don't know what the reason
would be, but maybe because

00:12:20.910 --> 00:12:23.250
it's hard to wrote, or it's
a pain in the backside

00:12:23.250 --> 00:12:25.450
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:25.450 --> 00:12:28.400
JAMES GRIME: OK, infinity's
a cool symbol.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:31.030
I mean, I might just
leave it at that.

00:12:31.030 --> 00:12:35.200
And it has an implication
of going forever, like a

00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:35.740
[INAUDIBLE].

00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:42.080
So there's an intuitive sense
of what it means.

00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:43.480
It's a well-chosen symbol.

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:45.570
I like that one.

00:12:45.570 --> 00:12:48.240
Ones I don't like?

00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:51.050
Because, in mathematics, we use
Greek letters a lot, lots

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:53.710
of Greek letters that
I can't write--

00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:57.200
all the Greek viewers now will
mock me, but there are some

00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:59.750
Greek letters I just don't
know how to write them.

00:12:59.750 --> 00:13:01.280
BRADY HARAN: On "Sixty Symbols,"
we have a lot of

00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:03.260
Greek letters come up, and
that's a real pain, trying to

00:13:03.260 --> 00:13:04.470
find them and work with them.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:05.540
So I feel your pain.

00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:07.950
JAMES GRIME: I apologize
to Greek viewers.

00:13:07.950 --> 00:13:08.930
BRADY HARAN: Wow.

00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:10.240
And you've got a 155 IQ.

00:13:10.240 --> 00:13:12.890
So if you can't do them, what
chance do the rest of us got?

00:13:12.890 --> 00:13:15.690
Is there a practical use
for Graham's number?

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.510
JAMES GRIME: Oh, right.

00:13:16.510 --> 00:13:23.350
So Graham's number, this famous
massively number, it

00:13:23.350 --> 00:13:25.080
came out of a practical
problem.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:27.360
It was a mathematical
problem, but it did

00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.680
come out of a problem.

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:32.490
So I guess it is born
of a problem.

00:13:32.490 --> 00:13:35.800
And the problem was about
taking a graph.

00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:38.150
A graph is a network
of dots and lines

00:13:38.150 --> 00:13:39.750
that you join together.

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.430
You take a graph, and how many
ways can you color a graph?

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:48.450
And it was born out of
a problem like that.

00:13:48.450 --> 00:13:52.580
And networks and graphs have
very practical uses, in things

00:13:52.580 --> 00:13:56.720
like on the internet and how
you join things together,

00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.260
networks together.

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:02.900
So I guess it does have a
practical use, very much so.

00:14:02.900 --> 00:14:04.480
BRADY HARAN: It's not like some
guy just made up this

00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:06.430
crazy number and then said,
now what can I use it for?

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:08.280
JAMES GRIME: Exactly right,
exactly right.

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.340
I mean, of course you could do
that by just adding one,

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.110
adding two.

00:14:11.110 --> 00:14:11.595
Yeah.

00:14:11.595 --> 00:14:15.480
No, it's famous because
it has a real use.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:18.720
And at that point, it was the
biggest number that had ever

00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:23.580
been used in a genuine
mathematical proof.

00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:25.120
BRADY HARAN: At this point,
because I'm gonna have a quick

00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:27.570
read of some of the questions,
and because it is Valentine's

00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.300
Day, you brought something
along with you.

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:33.240
We have made a video about these
numbers in this before,

00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:34.050
featuring James.

00:14:34.050 --> 00:14:36.450
It was one of our earlier
videos, so go and have a look.

00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.010
And I'll put it in the video
description later.

00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:39.510
But these are really nice.

00:14:39.510 --> 00:14:40.710
Maybe you should show these.

00:14:40.710 --> 00:14:41.970
Hold them up to the camera,
and you have

00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:42.780
a chat about them.

00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:46.350
JAMES GRIME: OK, so what I've
got here, these are my

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:48.110
amicable number.

00:14:48.110 --> 00:14:49.350
Can you see that?

00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:51.460
Let's see if I can get
that to focus.

00:14:51.460 --> 00:14:52.005
There we go.

00:14:52.005 --> 00:14:55.730
These are my amicable number
broken-heart chains.

00:14:55.730 --> 00:14:58.370
So that's 220 on that one.

00:14:58.370 --> 00:14:59.540
Can we get a focus?

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.310
284 on that one.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:08.540
And so the factors of 220 add
up to 284, while the factors

00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.280
of 284 add up to 220.

00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:14.680
So they come as a pair.

00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:20.170
And in the past, these would
symbolize mutual friendship,

00:15:20.170 --> 00:15:22.960
perfect harmony, and love.

00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:29.450
And so for Valentine's Day,
they are really sweet.

00:15:29.450 --> 00:15:30.605
It's a kind of a nerdy thing.

00:15:30.605 --> 00:15:33.085
But it's a really sweet thing.

00:15:33.085 --> 00:15:38.370
So we had these made, 220 and
284 key rings that join up.

00:15:38.370 --> 00:15:41.610
So you can keep one and give
the other half to your true

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:44.670
love, I guess.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.535
BRADY HARAN: Can one
obtain these?

00:15:47.535 --> 00:15:48.660
JAMES GRIME: Shall I, shall I?

00:15:48.660 --> 00:15:50.940
Yes, you can obtain these.

00:15:50.940 --> 00:15:52.410
BRADY HARAN: I have no
commercial interest in this

00:15:52.410 --> 00:15:52.980
whatsoever.

00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.785
But if people would want to
know if they can get them.

00:15:54.785 --> 00:15:56.120
JAMES GRIME: And I'm
shy doing it.

00:15:56.120 --> 00:16:00.860
But Matt Parker and myself--
now, Matt Parker is another

00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:02.700
"Numberphile" speaker.

00:16:02.700 --> 00:16:05.960
Matt Parker and myself, we're
friends in real life as well.

00:16:05.960 --> 00:16:10.820
So we set up a little company,
little business thing, where

00:16:10.820 --> 00:16:14.460
we were sending these "Amicable
Number" key rings,

00:16:14.460 --> 00:16:16.770
and other things as well, a
couple of maths things that we

00:16:16.770 --> 00:16:19.260
came up with that we thought
would be fun and other nerdy

00:16:19.260 --> 00:16:20.830
people might like.

00:16:20.830 --> 00:16:23.270
And it's called Maths Gear.

00:16:23.270 --> 00:16:25.050
If I hold this up,
there you go.

00:16:25.050 --> 00:16:26.120
BRADY HARAN: You brought that
just because that's

00:16:26.120 --> 00:16:26.550
what that was in.

00:16:26.550 --> 00:16:27.190
You didn't bring it to--

00:16:27.190 --> 00:16:29.170
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, that's
the packaging.

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:32.240
So Math Gear and
mathsgear.com.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:35.000
And yeah, we sell little bits.

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.160
We're not trying to--

00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:36.390
BRADY HARAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:16:36.390 --> 00:16:38.120
JAMES GRIME: We're not trying
to be rich by this.

00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.990
BRADY HARAN: If we were trying
to sell those for Valentine's

00:16:39.990 --> 00:16:41.800
Day, this is probably the worst
possible time to do it,

00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:43.910
because it's too late.

00:16:43.910 --> 00:16:47.070
You've got a year to get in your
hearts for next year's

00:16:47.070 --> 00:16:47.520
Valentine's Day.

00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:50.640
How's that for poorly
timed advertising?

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:51.305
Cool.

00:16:51.305 --> 00:16:54.110
We got loads of questions
coming in.

00:16:54.110 --> 00:16:57.180
What do you enjoy doing apart
from mathematics?

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.380
JAMES GRIME: OK, so my hobbies,
These days, of course

00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.590
I spend so much time traveling
and giving talks, it's

00:17:03.590 --> 00:17:06.740
difficult to do my
hobbies now.

00:17:06.740 --> 00:17:10.000
If you follow my Twitter, I
often talk about films and

00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.520
things, because I'm just
sitting around in train

00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:14.319
stations watching films.

00:17:14.319 --> 00:17:17.020
So I'm a big film fan.

00:17:17.020 --> 00:17:18.210
I used to do a lot of dancing.

00:17:18.210 --> 00:17:22.902
I used to do ballroom dancing,
jive dancing, so I can dance a

00:17:22.902 --> 00:17:23.400
little bit.

00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:23.790
I used to do that.

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:26.510
But it's difficult to
do it these days.

00:17:26.510 --> 00:17:28.150
And juggling is my big hobby.

00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:29.470
I'm a juggler.

00:17:29.470 --> 00:17:35.440
So I juggle clubs and balls
and knives and fire

00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.313
and rings and uni--

00:17:37.313 --> 00:17:39.170
I ride a unicycle.

00:17:39.170 --> 00:17:41.905
And it's one of my things.

00:17:41.905 --> 00:17:43.420
BRADY HARAN: Fair enough.

00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.530
Obviously someone knew that,
because one of the questions I

00:17:46.530 --> 00:17:50.450
was asked to ask you was, is
there a theoretical limit to

00:17:50.450 --> 00:17:52.810
the maximum number of balls
one can juggle?

00:17:52.810 --> 00:17:54.830
So they obviously knew you were
a juggler, or that's an

00:17:54.830 --> 00:17:56.440
amazing coincidence.

00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.760
JAMES GRIME: So theoretical
limit, there should be really

00:17:58.760 --> 00:18:03.500
no theoretical limit if, say,
we had a program of a stick

00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.530
man juggling balls.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:08.450
And his hands can be
as fast as light.

00:18:08.450 --> 00:18:10.350
And I think there are
programs like that.

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:12.880
And so there'd be no theoretical
limit, because

00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.490
he'd throw them higher.

00:18:14.490 --> 00:18:16.370
But there is a physical limit.

00:18:16.370 --> 00:18:20.780
So the record for juggling
balls, I think it's 13.

00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:23.050
It might be 11.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:25.590
Clubs, then, is a little
bit lower.

00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:27.910
So that would be 11,
or maybe it's nine.

00:18:27.910 --> 00:18:29.900
BRADY HARAN: I thought it might
be higher than that.

00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.460
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, clubs, I
think, so it's a little bit--

00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:32.540
BRADY HARAN: But the balls, I
thought, might be higher.

00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:33.870
JAMES GRIME: Oh, yeah,
you thought the

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.720
balls might up higher.

00:18:35.720 --> 00:18:37.970
Yeah, I think it might be 13.

00:18:37.970 --> 00:18:39.370
I could be wrong about that.

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:43.590
But it's not as high as you
think it would be, because of

00:18:43.590 --> 00:18:45.870
the physical problem of it.

00:18:45.870 --> 00:18:49.120
And then, as a friend
of mine said--

00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:52.310
I have to credit my friend here,
a friend of mine called

00:18:52.310 --> 00:18:53.240
Colin Wright.

00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.410
He's a mathematician and
a juggler as well.

00:18:55.410 --> 00:18:58.360
And he says that the world
record for juggling chainsaws

00:18:58.360 --> 00:19:04.120
is three, because, yeah, given
chainsaws, you're gonna juggle

00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:05.684
three of them.

00:19:05.684 --> 00:19:06.600
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:19:06.600 --> 00:19:09.980
While we're quickly doing a few
personal things about you,

00:19:09.980 --> 00:19:13.130
because people obviously have
an interest, I was asked to

00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:15.620
ask you your favorite song.

00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:20.170
JAMES GRIME: Favorite song is
"I Want You Back" by the

00:19:20.170 --> 00:19:21.405
Jackson Five.

00:19:21.405 --> 00:19:23.610
I'm a little bit camp.

00:19:23.610 --> 00:19:25.420
Sometimes I'm a little
bit camp.

00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:26.570
BRADY HARAN: You said
it, you said it.

00:19:26.570 --> 00:19:27.245
JAMES GRIME: Sometimes I am.

00:19:27.245 --> 00:19:29.890
BRADY HARAN: Do you have
a favorite shape?

00:19:29.890 --> 00:19:32.600
JAMES GRIME: Favorite shape.

00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:34.510
Not really, not really.

00:19:34.510 --> 00:19:37.720
For the sake of an answer,
let's say the circle.

00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.620
Because it's the limit,
isn't it, of your

00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:42.445
triangles and your squares?

00:19:42.445 --> 00:19:47.380
BRADY HARAN: Do you have a
favorite "Doctor Who" alien?

00:19:47.380 --> 00:19:48.860
I'm not asking these
questions.

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:52.090
This is you guys.

00:19:52.090 --> 00:19:57.060
JAMES GRIME: I can tell you that
my students used to call

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.600
me The Master.

00:19:58.600 --> 00:20:02.120
And The Master is Doctor
Who's enemy.

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.100
The Master is a time lord in
"Doctor Who." And he's Doctor

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.400
Who's enemy.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:09.300
And they used to call me The
Master because when my hair is

00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:12.740
short and I'm wearing my black
suit, as I like to wear a

00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:16.280
black suit, I look like-- or
they thought I look like--

00:20:16.280 --> 00:20:20.780
John Simm from "Doctor Who,"
who plays The Master.

00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:25.130
So when I discovered that they
were doing this, I was quite

00:20:25.130 --> 00:20:26.510
amused by that.

00:20:26.510 --> 00:20:29.620
And I came in the next lecture,
and I tested my

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:31.490
microphone by tapping it--

00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:33.996
[RAPS ON TABLE]

00:20:33.996 --> 00:20:35.420
JAMES GRIME: And the "Doctor
Who" fans will

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:36.270
know what that means.

00:20:36.270 --> 00:20:37.800
I got someone to squeal.

00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:41.710
I got a squeal from
my students.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:42.465
Tick.

00:20:42.465 --> 00:20:44.500
BRADY HARAN: And you got a
completely blank look from me.

00:20:44.500 --> 00:20:45.920
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, you don't
know [INAUDIBLE].

00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:46.990
BRADY HARAN: I don't know what
you're talking about.

00:20:46.990 --> 00:20:49.440
Do you have a favorite
mathematician?

00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.940
JAMES GRIME: A favorite
mathematician?

00:20:50.940 --> 00:20:53.640
OK, all right.

00:20:53.640 --> 00:20:56.880
On my office wall, there are
three photographs of

00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:59.210
mathematicians.

00:20:59.210 --> 00:21:02.700
There's a picture of a man
called Alfred Young, who was

00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:05.730
the father of what I study
in particular.

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:06.910
And many people won't
have heard of him.

00:21:06.910 --> 00:21:10.280
He lived about 100 years ago.

00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:12.230
There's a picture
of Tom Lehrer.

00:21:12.230 --> 00:21:15.810
Tom Lehrer was a mathematician
and a satirist in

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:17.670
the 1960s, a comedian.

00:21:17.670 --> 00:21:20.010
He used to do satirical songs.

00:21:20.010 --> 00:21:21.830
And I love him.

00:21:21.830 --> 00:21:22.390
I think he's great.

00:21:22.390 --> 00:21:26.340
The fact that he's a
mathematician is just a bonus.

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:26.980
He's brilliant.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.100
And I've got a picture of
him, because I love him.

00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:31.920
And the third picture is a
picture of Johnny Ball.

00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:37.320
And Johnny Ball was a-- he
had a TV show about maths

00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:38.870
when I was a kid.

00:21:38.870 --> 00:21:42.510
So he was enthusiastic, and he
was a maths communicator.

00:21:42.510 --> 00:21:46.130
And he loved maths, and he
jumped up and down, and he

00:21:46.130 --> 00:21:47.880
wanted to show you maths.

00:21:47.880 --> 00:21:54.780
And he inspired me to continue
to do maths and show an

00:21:54.780 --> 00:21:59.340
interest in maths when I would
not have had exposure to that

00:21:59.340 --> 00:22:01.730
sort of thing before.

00:22:01.730 --> 00:22:06.100
And you may be able to see that
he's my inspiration and

00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.740
why I do what I do now.

00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:11.990
And you may even be
able to see that.

00:22:11.990 --> 00:22:15.100
BRADY HARAN: So many people have
asked to see you juggle

00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:16.690
that we're going to
have to do it.

00:22:16.690 --> 00:22:19.010
I've only got some cricket
balls and baseballs here.

00:22:19.010 --> 00:22:19.820
So what do you want?

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:20.810
Two baseballs and
a cricket ball?

00:22:20.810 --> 00:22:22.060
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, sure.

00:22:24.415 --> 00:22:25.840
Have to keep them low as well.

00:22:25.840 --> 00:22:27.053
BRADY HARAN: You will.

00:22:27.053 --> 00:22:27.526
There you go.

00:22:27.526 --> 00:22:29.700
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.320
Right.

00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:32.300
So I'll get my excuses in now.

00:22:32.300 --> 00:22:34.550
BRADY HARAN: If you do
it, I will do it.

00:22:34.550 --> 00:22:37.540
JAMES GRIME: Oh,
can you do it?

00:22:37.540 --> 00:22:38.850
So that's your simple stuff.

00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:39.835
But you know, you can go--

00:22:39.835 --> 00:22:40.490
BRADY HARAN: Oh yeah.

00:22:40.490 --> 00:22:41.360
JAMES GRIME: And stuff
like that.

00:22:41.360 --> 00:22:42.610
[INAUDIBLE].

00:22:44.450 --> 00:22:44.770
You're up.

00:22:44.770 --> 00:22:45.940
Get off to it.

00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:48.050
BRADY HARAN: I'm impressed.

00:22:48.050 --> 00:22:49.410
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:49.410 --> 00:22:49.875
There you go.

00:22:49.875 --> 00:22:51.349
BRADY HARAN: All right,
here I go.

00:22:54.632 --> 00:22:55.570
JAMES GRIME: Hey.

00:22:55.570 --> 00:22:56.140
BRADY HARAN: There we go.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:57.695
You want to see one
on the outside?

00:22:57.695 --> 00:22:58.940
JAMES GRIME: Whoa, whoa.

00:22:58.940 --> 00:23:00.840
Yeah, I'm nervous when
you throw the

00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.400
cricket ball in my direction.

00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.810
BRADY HARAN: It's completely
under control.

00:23:04.810 --> 00:23:06.920
We'll have to get you doing some
more of your elaborate

00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:07.610
juggling for a video.

00:23:07.610 --> 00:23:08.800
We'll find an excuse sometime.

00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.488
JAMES GRIME: We'll
see about that.

00:23:10.488 --> 00:23:13.096
BRADY HARAN: Let's get
back in our position

00:23:13.096 --> 00:23:14.610
after that little interlude.

00:23:14.610 --> 00:23:16.050
Favorite number?

00:23:16.050 --> 00:23:16.550
JAMES GRIME: Favorite number.

00:23:16.550 --> 00:23:19.600
Of course everyone asks your
favorite number, and I don't

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:21.500
really have a favorite number.

00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:23.020
BRADY HARAN: What if I said,
choose a number or I will

00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:23.835
throw this cricket
ball at you?

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:28.320
JAMES GRIME: OK, in that case,
I will choose the number one.

00:23:28.320 --> 00:23:31.620
Where would we be without
the number one?

00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:32.150
BRADY HARAN: Fair enough.

00:23:32.150 --> 00:23:33.690
The next question was, do you
have a favorite number

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.280
between 1 and 100?

00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:36.675
So you've also covered
that, so well done.

00:23:36.675 --> 00:23:36.866
JAMES GRIME: Tick.

00:23:36.866 --> 00:23:39.621
BRADY HARAN: I'll cross
that off the list.

00:23:39.621 --> 00:23:42.060
Do you want to quickly
just tell people what

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:42.920
your current job is?

00:23:42.920 --> 00:23:45.090
A lot of people will have seen
me made a "Numberphile" video

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:49.180
with you in which you were
showcasing the Enigma machine.

00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:51.520
And that is a big part of your
job as well, your real job.

00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:53.100
So maybe you want to tell people
what your real-life job

00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:53.750
is these days.

00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:54.480
I'll get you to come in.

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.866
JAMES GRIME: Yeah,
a bit closer.

00:23:55.866 --> 00:23:56.330
BRADY HARAN: Go ahead.

00:23:56.330 --> 00:23:58.040
JAMES GRIME: So my real job.

00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:03.080
So my day job is, I travel the
UK and I travel the world, and

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:05.510
I give public talks
about maths.

00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:09.490
And I'm trying to inspire, I'm
trying to motivate people.

00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:13.250
And I might talk to children,
and I might talk to adults.

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.060
And it might be in schools,
and it might be in

00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:15.820
universities.

00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:18.070
It might be in festivals.

00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.870
Enigma is the one I like
to talk about most.

00:24:21.870 --> 00:24:26.030
So we have that machine
on loan to us.

00:24:26.030 --> 00:24:29.900
And it's one of the most
inspiring and fascinating and

00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:33.320
brilliant stories that
I love to tell.

00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.690
And that's the majority
of my time.

00:24:35.690 --> 00:24:38.770
I do that a lot.

00:24:38.770 --> 00:24:40.750
BRADY HARAN: You have am Enigma
machine that's been

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.485
lent to you or to the--

00:24:42.485 --> 00:24:44.645
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, the
machine I show off

00:24:44.645 --> 00:24:46.080
belongs to Simon Singh.

00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:50.340
And Simon Singh is an author
of popular science books.

00:24:50.340 --> 00:24:54.420
And he lent it to Cambridge
University, who lent it, in

00:24:54.420 --> 00:24:57.160
turn, to me so that I can
show it off and tell

00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.390
people about it.

00:24:59.390 --> 00:25:00.480
BRADY HARAN: Do you
like games?

00:25:00.480 --> 00:25:01.940
Do you play games?

00:25:01.940 --> 00:25:02.980
JAMES GRIME: I'm guessing
you mean, like,

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.930
online computer games.

00:25:04.930 --> 00:25:06.259
BRADY HARAN: I don't know.

00:25:06.259 --> 00:25:07.590
Let's open it to everything.

00:25:07.590 --> 00:25:10.260
First of all, do you play
computer games?

00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:14.605
JAMES GRIME: Computer games, I
play occasionally something.

00:25:14.605 --> 00:25:16.370
I'm a casual gamer.

00:25:16.370 --> 00:25:19.446
I play the 10 minutes of games,
so, like, your "Angry

00:25:19.446 --> 00:25:24.170
Birds." And I've got an Atari
that you plug into your TV.

00:25:24.170 --> 00:25:25.350
And I play "Space Invaders."

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:27.185
BRADY HARAN: A proper
old-school Atari?

00:25:27.185 --> 00:25:28.700
JAMES GRIME: Well, it's
one of those, they

00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:29.840
put it inside a joystick.

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:31.560
So you plug it straight
to the TV.

00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:31.890
BRADY HARAN: Cool.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:35.890
JAMES GRIME: And it's got "Super
Mario" on it and "Space

00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:39.190
Invaders" and "Galaga." I like
"Galaga." I'm a demon on

00:25:39.190 --> 00:25:40.730
"Galaga." You can't beat
me at "Galaga."

00:25:40.730 --> 00:25:43.802
BRADY HARAN: And do
you play any--

00:25:43.802 --> 00:25:45.950
what I call them,
real-life games?

00:25:45.950 --> 00:25:47.610
JAMES GRIME: Real-life games.

00:25:47.610 --> 00:25:48.400
Real-life games.

00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:49.845
BRADY HARAN: I don't know
what you call those.

00:25:49.845 --> 00:25:50.495
I don't know.

00:25:50.495 --> 00:25:50.790
JAMES GRIME: What?

00:25:50.790 --> 00:25:51.985
What are you saying, tag?

00:25:51.985 --> 00:25:53.360
BRADY HARAN: Non-electrical
games?

00:25:53.360 --> 00:25:54.430
Do you play--

00:25:54.430 --> 00:25:56.120
you know what I'm asking.

00:25:56.120 --> 00:25:57.370
Answer the question.

00:25:59.750 --> 00:26:02.950
JAMES GRIME: Oh, like,
"Monopoly." There we go.

00:26:02.950 --> 00:26:04.530
That's all I can think
of board games.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:06.120
Oh, role-playing games,
things like that.

00:26:06.120 --> 00:26:08.380
OK, so I'm not really
in that world.

00:26:08.380 --> 00:26:10.250
So I guess not.

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.050
Role-playing, board games, I
have friends that do that.

00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:14.990
I'm not really into it.

00:26:14.990 --> 00:26:16.800
BRADY HARAN: Any sports
or anything you like?

00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.680
JAMES GRIME: Any sports?

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:18.952
Nah.

00:26:18.952 --> 00:26:20.630
BRADY HARAN: There's a
game you told me you

00:26:20.630 --> 00:26:22.010
play all the time.

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:23.380
JAMES GRIME: If you
count, yeah.

00:26:23.380 --> 00:26:26.690
I play sport if you count bar
billiards as a sport.

00:26:26.690 --> 00:26:27.950
BRADY HARAN: You're obsessed
with bar billiards.

00:26:27.950 --> 00:26:29.050
You always talk to
me about it.

00:26:29.050 --> 00:26:29.970
JAMES GRIME: I am obsessed.

00:26:29.970 --> 00:26:30.920
BRADY HARAN: You want to
make a video about it.

00:26:30.920 --> 00:26:31.270
JAMES GRIME: I do.

00:26:31.270 --> 00:26:33.425
I would love to make a video
about bar billiards.

00:26:33.425 --> 00:26:35.440
Bar billiards is an
awesome game.

00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:35.802
BRADY HARAN: What is
bar billiards, for

00:26:35.802 --> 00:26:36.010
those who don't know?

00:26:36.010 --> 00:26:39.760
JAMES GRIME: Bar billiards, so
billiards, you know, so you've

00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.560
got cues and a table
and billiard balls.

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.540
And so snooker is a sort of
billiards game, and pool.

00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:50.820
But bar billiards is, you
got a couple of balls.

00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.185
You have to get them
into the holes.

00:26:52.185 --> 00:26:53.390
The holes are in the table.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:54.990
They're not pockets
at the sides.

00:26:54.990 --> 00:26:55.540
They're in the table.

00:26:55.540 --> 00:26:56.600
You get points.

00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:59.160
So you score as many
points as you can.

00:26:59.160 --> 00:27:01.240
And you have to score
as many points as

00:27:01.240 --> 00:27:02.950
you can in 30 minutes.

00:27:02.950 --> 00:27:04.005
And it's awesome.

00:27:04.005 --> 00:27:05.700
It's brilliant.

00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:08.570
BRADY HARAN: People have asked
if you play chess, and if you

00:27:08.570 --> 00:27:10.935
have a preference for
chess or draughts.

00:27:10.935 --> 00:27:12.610
JAMES GRIME: Oh, I guess
chess, really.

00:27:12.610 --> 00:27:14.900
But I do play chess.

00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:16.713
Not that brilliant at it.

00:27:16.713 --> 00:27:18.420
I used to play chess
with my dad a lot.

00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:19.950
It was a nice thing
we used to do.

00:27:19.950 --> 00:27:23.180
We used to have a chess board
in the living room.

00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:25.670
And we had a counter that
was white on one side,

00:27:25.670 --> 00:27:26.820
black on the other.

00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:29.260
So you'd play a move
and then walk away.

00:27:29.260 --> 00:27:33.850
Then the next, we'd come in
and go, oh, I see, oh, OK.

00:27:33.850 --> 00:27:35.590
We rigged it up.

00:27:35.590 --> 00:27:37.780
I really enjoyed doing that.

00:27:37.780 --> 00:27:40.280
BRADY HARAN: People have asked
whether or not you read the

00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.420
comments and the chats and
things underneath videos.

00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:45.080
You're obviously in lots
of video, your own and

00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:45.820
"Numberphile".

00:27:45.820 --> 00:27:47.370
Do you read comments?

00:27:47.370 --> 00:27:50.990
JAMES GRIME: I read all the
comments on my own channel,

00:27:50.990 --> 00:27:53.520
the comments and the
messages I get.

00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:55.895
And I'm not always able
to answer them all.

00:27:55.895 --> 00:27:58.520
Even if I did, I mean, I
just don't have time

00:27:58.520 --> 00:27:59.100
to answer them all.

00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:00.300
I'm sorry.

00:28:00.300 --> 00:28:04.795
And then on the "Numberphile"
ones, I check, yes.

00:28:04.795 --> 00:28:07.060
So yes.

00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:09.390
I was considering denying
it, because it kind of

00:28:09.390 --> 00:28:10.290
makes me less cool.

00:28:10.290 --> 00:28:10.910
But no, I check.

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:12.970
I don't check them
obsessively.

00:28:17.398 --> 00:28:20.510
Yeah, what are you pointing
out, Brady?

00:28:20.510 --> 00:28:23.870
BRADY HARAN: There is someone
commenting, using your face

00:28:23.870 --> 00:28:25.680
and the name James
Grime on YouTube.

00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:27.550
And we should point out,
that is not James.

00:28:27.550 --> 00:28:28.900
That is just some--

00:28:28.900 --> 00:28:30.940
well, I won't use unsuitable
words.

00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:31.750
But that's someone who is--

00:28:31.750 --> 00:28:32.610
JAMES GRIME: It's not me.

00:28:32.610 --> 00:28:33.500
BRADY HARAN: --who is
being creative.

00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.540
And that's not James.

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:38.307
And I personally don't think
people should be doing that.

00:28:38.307 --> 00:28:38.990
But who am I?

00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:41.020
I'm just some guy,
so there you go.

00:28:41.020 --> 00:28:43.720
Someone asked a question a bit
earlier that I did like.

00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:48.430
And that is, when your life is
so much mathematics, do you

00:28:48.430 --> 00:28:52.260
find yourself just doing,
without even meaning to, like,

00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:56.090
counting the number of times you
chewed that sandwich, and

00:28:56.090 --> 00:28:59.380
looking at a shape or a house
and thinking about dimensions

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.780
and equations?

00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.200
JAMES GRIME: No, not really.

00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.790
I mean, we talked about
those-- vampires and

00:29:06.790 --> 00:29:08.586
arithmomania and things like
that, and counting

00:29:08.586 --> 00:29:09.260
the number of steps.

00:29:09.260 --> 00:29:10.185
And that's a real condition.

00:29:10.185 --> 00:29:11.880
There are people who do that.

00:29:11.880 --> 00:29:16.580
I don't think mathematicians, as
a rule, have arithmomania.

00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.700
I certainly do not.

00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:21.720
But maybe you're asking, maybe
in broader terms, do I look at

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.320
the world and see
it as equations

00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:25.670
and things like that?

00:29:25.670 --> 00:29:30.260
And do you know, no,
I probably do not.

00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:31.960
BRADY HARAN: I mean, I'm not
going so much for the personal

00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:34.650
questions, because you know,
away from "Numberphile",

00:29:34.650 --> 00:29:37.910
you're your own man, but I do
have to ask, what pajamas do

00:29:37.910 --> 00:29:40.850
you wear to bed?

00:29:40.850 --> 00:29:42.300
JAMES GRIME: OK.

00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.910
BRADY HARAN: Just because I
didn't expect that question.

00:29:43.910 --> 00:29:46.610
Most of the questions
I can expect, but--

00:29:46.610 --> 00:29:47.390
JAMES GRIME: Oh, right.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.640
OK, well, I guess--

00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.770
I'm considering lying.

00:29:52.770 --> 00:29:53.880
But I'll just tell you
the real answer.

00:29:53.880 --> 00:29:54.990
Shall I?

00:29:54.990 --> 00:29:56.460
BRADY HARAN: Because they're,
like, Spider-Man or something.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.830
That would be so cool.

00:29:57.830 --> 00:29:58.180
JAMES GRIME: No.

00:29:58.180 --> 00:30:02.650
I just wear the t-shirt that
I'm wearing during the day.

00:30:02.650 --> 00:30:03.460
And then--

00:30:03.460 --> 00:30:04.600
BRADY HARAN: I've never
seen you in a t-shirt.

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:05.630
You're always wearing a shirt.

00:30:05.630 --> 00:30:05.860
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:06.910
BRADY HARAN: Oh yeah, OK.

00:30:06.910 --> 00:30:08.766
Fair enough.

00:30:08.766 --> 00:30:12.400
A lot of people have asked, do
you have a preference for base

00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:15.720
12, base 16, or decimal?

00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.390
JAMES GRIME: Base 12,
base 16, or decimal?

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:20.430
Do you know what?

00:30:20.430 --> 00:30:23.200
Preference, I'm quite convinced

00:30:23.200 --> 00:30:26.950
by the base 12 people.

00:30:26.950 --> 00:30:28.770
I like their arguments.

00:30:28.770 --> 00:30:31.230
They're not grand--

00:30:31.230 --> 00:30:34.223
you know, it doesn't change
mathematics in a grand way or

00:30:34.223 --> 00:30:35.830
in a fundamental way.

00:30:35.830 --> 00:30:41.920
But the day-to-day use of it, I
do actually agree with them.

00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:44.300
I wish we did have base 12.

00:30:44.300 --> 00:30:49.270
Time would still be the same,
but weights and measures

00:30:49.270 --> 00:30:51.105
should go back to
being base 12.

00:30:51.105 --> 00:30:52.990
And it'd be brilliant.

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.810
BRADY HARAN: If you're
quite new to

00:30:53.810 --> 00:30:55.805
"Numberphile", we did a--

00:30:55.805 --> 00:30:55.880
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, we did.

00:30:55.880 --> 00:30:58.970
BRADY HARAN: --base 12 video
with James, talking about the

00:30:58.970 --> 00:31:00.870
pros and cons of
using base 12.

00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:02.810
And again, well worth
a look after this.

00:31:02.810 --> 00:31:04.040
And I'll put a link in the
video subscription.

00:31:04.040 --> 00:31:05.100
JAMES GRIME: Sure.

00:31:05.100 --> 00:31:08.040
Because I like them, I'm going
to give those guys a plug.

00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:10.640
That was the-- was
it [INAUDIBLE]

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:11.915
society of America?

00:31:11.915 --> 00:31:13.970
And they have a Twitter
account as well.

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:15.670
Now you have to watch
them on Twitter.

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:19.850
And every day, they give you
a little base 12 fact.

00:31:19.850 --> 00:31:21.840
And I really enjoy those.

00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:23.100
BRADY HARAN: Well, they do one
every day, don't they?

00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:23.800
JAMES GRIME: Yeah,
pretty much.

00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:24.320
BRADY HARAN: They should
do one every,

00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:26.600
like, 12th day or something.

00:31:26.600 --> 00:31:27.630
JAMES GRIME: Every 12 hours?

00:31:27.630 --> 00:31:29.270
BRADY HARAN: Oh yeah, that's
a better idea.

00:31:29.270 --> 00:31:30.410
Yeah.

00:31:30.410 --> 00:31:33.760
OK, do you have a favorite
branch of mathematics?

00:31:33.760 --> 00:31:36.450
And maybe you could quickly
run through it, because I

00:31:36.450 --> 00:31:37.310
think it's really interesting.

00:31:37.310 --> 00:31:40.220
And it's not something we've
talked about in "Numberphile".

00:31:40.220 --> 00:31:45.130
How is mathematics broken into
groups at that academic level?

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:47.990
Like, in chemistry, we have
organic and inorganic, and

00:31:47.990 --> 00:31:49.110
physical and things like that.

00:31:49.110 --> 00:31:50.680
How do you break maths up?

00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:52.150
And then what do you like?

00:31:52.150 --> 00:31:52.960
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:56.400
So maths is broken up in the
same way as chemistry is.

00:31:56.400 --> 00:31:59.020
So maths is broken up into--

00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.780
well, we've got pure maths.

00:32:00.780 --> 00:32:01.540
Let's start with pure maths.

00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:02.270
And that's what I do.

00:32:02.270 --> 00:32:04.790
I'm a pure mathematician,
pure maths.

00:32:04.790 --> 00:32:08.230
And then that's broken up into
algebra and analysis.

00:32:08.230 --> 00:32:10.110
Now, I do algebra.

00:32:10.110 --> 00:32:12.960
And from my point, I think
algebra is about looking at

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:13.960
the big picture.

00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:18.130
It's about large mathematical
objects, whereas analysis is

00:32:18.130 --> 00:32:19.500
about the details.

00:32:19.500 --> 00:32:21.480
So it looks at the real number,
and it looks at those

00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.550
in details.

00:32:22.550 --> 00:32:25.920
And I'm more about algebra
than analysis.

00:32:25.920 --> 00:32:30.050
There's statistics, which I'm
a big fan of statistics,

00:32:30.050 --> 00:32:32.150
probability statistics.

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:35.430
And then there's mathematical
physics, and things of that

00:32:35.430 --> 00:32:40.530
nature, which I don't really
do mathematical physics.

00:32:40.530 --> 00:32:44.480
BRADY HARAN: OK, I'm
cool with that.

00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.480
There's been a bit asked.

00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:47.550
And you probably are a good
person to ask about this,

00:32:47.550 --> 00:32:50.800
because you spend so
much time going to

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.630
schools and meeting students.

00:32:52.630 --> 00:32:56.080
And we've done a few videos-- on
"Sixty Symbols," I think it

00:32:56.080 --> 00:33:00.680
was, that I did some videos,
about education and how

00:33:00.680 --> 00:33:04.770
mathematics has this reputation
that sort of

00:33:04.770 --> 00:33:06.910
permeates society,
of maths is hard.

00:33:06.910 --> 00:33:08.380
It's almost a joke, isn't it?

00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:10.420
That, oh no, I've got maths,
maths is hard?

00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:12.100
And it puts people off.

00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:14.240
There's a real stigma
attached to it.

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:18.310
What do you think about the
state of maths education and

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:22.230
the reputation of mathematics
at that level of people who

00:33:22.230 --> 00:33:24.130
are just kind of at crucial
parts of their lives.

00:33:24.130 --> 00:33:24.680
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:33:24.680 --> 00:33:29.272
So this idea about maths is
hard, that's certainly a

00:33:29.272 --> 00:33:31.150
cultural problem.

00:33:31.150 --> 00:33:34.740
So it's not true in other places
and in other countries.

00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.817
And things like, you know, it's
a boys' subjects or it's

00:33:36.817 --> 00:33:40.200
a girls' subject, this
is a cultural thing.

00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:43.040
And there's absolutely
no reason for that.

00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:45.540
But there is that reputation.

00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:47.740
I don't want to speak
out of turn.

00:33:47.740 --> 00:33:49.320
I'm not a maths teacher.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:50.605
I'm not a teacher.

00:33:50.605 --> 00:33:53.490
I don't want to speak
for those.

00:33:53.490 --> 00:33:55.840
I am what I am.

00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:59.410
I'm an academic who, sometimes
I work with children.

00:33:59.410 --> 00:34:01.795
And I enjoy doing so.

00:34:01.795 --> 00:34:04.290
So I don't want to speak
out of turn.

00:34:04.290 --> 00:34:08.909
But there are things that can
be done, and I know there a

00:34:08.909 --> 00:34:12.980
lot of people who care about
maths education, who know that

00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:14.290
there are things that
can be done.

00:34:14.290 --> 00:34:16.570
They know what could be
done, and they are

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:18.790
trying to do that.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:23.320
And in a small part, I'm trying
to do that, too, by

00:34:23.320 --> 00:34:26.940
showing how maths can
be inspiration

00:34:26.940 --> 00:34:29.190
and motivate people.

00:34:29.190 --> 00:34:32.320
I have my part as well.

00:34:32.320 --> 00:34:35.229
But there are better people who
understand the problems

00:34:35.229 --> 00:34:37.530
better than I do.

00:34:37.530 --> 00:34:41.236
And I don't want to
speak out of turn.

00:34:41.236 --> 00:34:43.659
BRADY HARAN: A few quick ones.

00:34:43.659 --> 00:34:44.909
Pi or tau?

00:34:47.139 --> 00:34:50.030
JAMES GRIME: Do you know what?

00:34:50.030 --> 00:34:52.785
"Numberphile" has slightly
convinced me, because before

00:34:52.785 --> 00:34:58.780
your "Numberphile" pi and tau
one, the one with Professor

00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.400
Moriarty in it--

00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.360
BRADY HARAN: Yes,
Phil Moriarty.

00:35:00.360 --> 00:35:02.022
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:35:02.022 --> 00:35:04.960
I was gonna say, I
was thinking pi.

00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:05.790
Pi's fine.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:09.270
I mean, there is absolutely no
reason to change to tau.

00:35:11.920 --> 00:35:14.610
It makes sense as it is.

00:35:14.610 --> 00:35:18.740
And Professor Moriarty said one
thing that convinced me.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:23.410
It was, tau is a full turn, and
then you get a quarter of

00:35:23.410 --> 00:35:26.950
a turn, a half-turn, three
fourths of a turn.

00:35:26.950 --> 00:35:29.230
Tau is a turn that--

00:35:29.230 --> 00:35:31.560
yeah, that convinced me-- for
the first time, really.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:35.020
I was pretty ambivalent
about it.

00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:37.350
But we'll give that to
Professor Moriarty.

00:35:37.350 --> 00:35:39.125
BRADY HARAN: What a great
advertisement for the video.

00:35:39.125 --> 00:35:40.960
I hope you'll all go and
watch it afterwards.

00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:41.740
And I'll put the link below.

00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:44.220
And Professor Moriarty would
be over the moon with your

00:35:44.220 --> 00:35:44.720
endorsement.

00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.370
How many digits can
you recite pi to?

00:35:46.370 --> 00:35:47.850
I'm not putting you
on the spot.

00:35:47.850 --> 00:35:48.580
Someone just--

00:35:48.580 --> 00:35:51.960
JAMES GRIME: Oh, to the
calculator length, I guess.

00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:57.010
3.141592654.

00:35:57.010 --> 00:35:57.647
Something like that.

00:35:57.647 --> 00:35:58.210
BRADY HARAN: Oh, I don't know.

00:35:58.210 --> 00:35:58.955
I don't know, so [INAUDIBLE].

00:35:58.955 --> 00:35:59.880
JAMES GRIME: Something
along those lines.

00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:00.990
BRADY HARAN: I'm sure we'll hear
about it if you got any

00:36:00.990 --> 00:36:02.320
of those wrong.

00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:04.040
Favorite food?

00:36:04.040 --> 00:36:04.820
JAMES GRIME: Favorite food?

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:06.070
I like Chinese.

00:36:06.070 --> 00:36:07.590
BRADY HARAN: Oh yeah,
I like Chinese.

00:36:07.590 --> 00:36:10.230
There's a really good Chinese
on the corner.

00:36:10.230 --> 00:36:11.070
JAMES GRIME: Yeah?

00:36:11.070 --> 00:36:11.490
BRADY HARAN: There is.

00:36:11.490 --> 00:36:13.040
Oh, but you're going back to
Cambridge, aren't you?

00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:16.160
But if you want to stay for a
Chinese with-- you know, we'll

00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:16.920
sort you out.

00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:18.255
It's up to you.

00:36:18.255 --> 00:36:20.980
Favorite color?

00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:23.010
JAMES GRIME: Nothing in
particular, nothing.

00:36:23.010 --> 00:36:23.400
Yellow.

00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:25.000
I like yellow.

00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:25.930
BRADY HARAN: Why?

00:36:25.930 --> 00:36:28.680
JAMES GRIME: It's a bright,
colorful color.

00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:31.650
And I like the bright.

00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.490
I have a short attention
span, and I like

00:36:33.490 --> 00:36:34.490
bright shiny things.

00:36:34.490 --> 00:36:36.300
Yellow, sunshine, yes.

00:36:36.300 --> 00:36:38.690
BRADY HARAN: OK.

00:36:38.690 --> 00:36:40.710
Can you solve a Rubik's Cube?

00:36:40.710 --> 00:36:40.930
JAMES GRIME: Yes.

00:36:40.930 --> 00:36:42.420
BRADY HARAN: And how quickly?

00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:43.880
JAMES GRIME: Yes, but badly.

00:36:43.880 --> 00:36:44.580
BRADY HARAN: You know,
I've got one.

00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:46.700
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, I can
solve one in about four

00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:47.640
minutes, I'm afraid.

00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:48.650
I'm not clever.

00:36:48.650 --> 00:36:50.850
BRADY HARAN: We're not gonna
make you do it on the spot.

00:36:50.850 --> 00:36:51.206
JAMES GRIME: No, no.

00:36:51.206 --> 00:36:52.960
I know the beginner's method.

00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.130
And it takes me a long time.

00:36:55.130 --> 00:36:59.920
But I learned to solve the
Rubik's Cube not as a kid.

00:36:59.920 --> 00:37:05.220
I learned to solve it because
I use it as a prop, as a

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:07.160
visual aid to teach group
theory, which

00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:09.320
is my area of maths.

00:37:09.320 --> 00:37:13.960
And the Rubik's Cube is an
application of group theory.

00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:17.100
So I'm learned it as a prop.

00:37:17.100 --> 00:37:19.651
And I'm not very good at it.

00:37:19.651 --> 00:37:22.022
BRADY HARAN: This is an
interesting question.

00:37:22.022 --> 00:37:23.710
Answer carefully.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:25.200
Favorite YouTube?

00:37:25.200 --> 00:37:26.880
What YouTube channels
do you watch?

00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:27.170
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:37:27.170 --> 00:37:27.640
BRADY HARAN: That's interesting

00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.550
to hear about, yeah.

00:37:29.550 --> 00:37:31.090
JAMES GRIME: Do you want me to
do the science ones or the

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.150
non-science ones?

00:37:33.150 --> 00:37:34.920
BRADY HARAN: Go.

00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:36.295
The question just says,
favorite YouTuber.

00:37:36.295 --> 00:37:38.030
So you go ahead.

00:37:38.030 --> 00:37:39.140
JAMES GRIME: All right,
let's see.

00:37:39.140 --> 00:37:42.225
So Brady aside then.

00:37:42.225 --> 00:37:43.960
BRADY HARAN: No, no, no.

00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:45.100
No, no, no.

00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:46.230
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE]

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:46.920
videos.

00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.320
BRADY HARAN: You can just say
all my channels as one and

00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:48.742
forget about it.

00:37:48.742 --> 00:37:49.506
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:37:49.506 --> 00:37:53.320
And "Bibledex" and things
that I loved.

00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:54.730
The maths channels--

00:37:54.730 --> 00:37:56.600
and I hope they'll like this.

00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:00.340
Of course we know Vihart
is a brilliant channel.

00:38:00.340 --> 00:38:00.820
BRADY HARAN: Yes.

00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:03.395
JAMES GRIME: And then there's
things like Khan Academy.

00:38:03.395 --> 00:38:05.150
A couple of my favorites
that are less

00:38:05.150 --> 00:38:07.830
well-known is Ty Yann.

00:38:07.830 --> 00:38:10.660
He's a maths teacher
in Seoul, in Korea.

00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.810
And he does mathematical
prisms and things.

00:38:12.810 --> 00:38:16.870
Ty Yann, T-Y Y-A-N-N, Ty Yann.

00:38:16.870 --> 00:38:19.760
And then Dr. James Stan--

00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:20.920
Tanton, sorry.

00:38:20.920 --> 00:38:23.180
I always get his S mixed up.

00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:28.040
Dr. James Tanton, I think he
lives in Australia now.

00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.980
And he has some fascinating,
brilliant videos.

00:38:31.980 --> 00:38:33.640
I love him.

00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:36.730
And people will be less
aware of him.

00:38:36.730 --> 00:38:41.090
And then if you talk about
non-science and maths, I have

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.340
lots of favorite ones, some of
them that are less well-known.

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:45.480
BRADY HARAN: We're about
to run [INAUDIBLE]

00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.885
JAMES GRIME: I'm gonna say
hello to my friends.

00:38:47.885 --> 00:38:48.230
BRADY HARAN: Hang on.

00:38:48.230 --> 00:38:49.130
I've got a power cable.

00:38:49.130 --> 00:38:51.330
We're about to run
out of power.

00:38:51.330 --> 00:38:52.500
JAMES GRIME: I've been
talking too much.

00:38:52.500 --> 00:38:53.450
BRADY HARAN: No, no, no.

00:38:53.450 --> 00:38:54.230
Do you know what?

00:38:54.230 --> 00:38:54.920
It was my fault.

00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:56.290
When we started, I said
oh, I must make sure I

00:38:56.290 --> 00:38:57.830
plug the power in.

00:38:57.830 --> 00:38:58.570
And then I didn't.

00:38:58.570 --> 00:38:59.500
We just got the [INAUDIBLE].

00:38:59.500 --> 00:39:01.420
JAMES GRIME: All right,
we'll change angle.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.300
BRADY HARAN: This is putting
a little bit

00:39:02.300 --> 00:39:03.010
more prominence on--

00:39:03.010 --> 00:39:03.560
JAMES GRIME: Hello.

00:39:03.560 --> 00:39:04.980
BRADY HARAN: --me.

00:39:04.980 --> 00:39:05.510
Yeah.

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:07.090
JAMES GRIME: A couple
of friends I want to

00:39:07.090 --> 00:39:08.280
say hello to at You--

00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:11.460
I am a YouTuber, so
I do have friends.

00:39:11.460 --> 00:39:14.470
Mismag822, the magician,
hello.

00:39:14.470 --> 00:39:16.590
Ericsurf6, hello.

00:39:16.590 --> 00:39:20.000
And other favorite
channels I have--

00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:21.605
CommunityChannel, Natalie.

00:39:21.605 --> 00:39:23.160
Nat, right?

00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.090
I am absolutely in
love with Nat.

00:39:26.090 --> 00:39:27.370
OK.

00:39:27.370 --> 00:39:28.520
BRADY HARAN: Well, now
you brought it up.

00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:29.185
I wasn't gonna bring it up.

00:39:29.185 --> 00:39:30.505
But you say you're in
love with someone.

00:39:30.505 --> 00:39:34.210
There have been loads of
questions about your

00:39:34.210 --> 00:39:36.210
availability or otherwise.

00:39:36.210 --> 00:39:37.890
I'm just saying, there's been
loads of questions.

00:39:37.890 --> 00:39:39.290
You can say what you want.

00:39:39.290 --> 00:39:40.300
JAMES GRIME: Are they offers?

00:39:40.300 --> 00:39:42.180
Or are they just questions?

00:39:42.180 --> 00:39:44.460
BRADY HARAN: I wouldn't
say they'd be offers.

00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.560
I don't know if it's just a kind
of a curiosity with other

00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:50.010
intent or not.

00:39:50.010 --> 00:39:52.220
But I'm just saying, there's
been lots of questions.

00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.250
And I'm not saying anything.

00:39:54.250 --> 00:39:55.776
JAMES GRIME: Well,
then I'll just--

00:39:55.776 --> 00:39:56.900
yeah, here I am.

00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:58.300
This is me.

00:39:58.300 --> 00:40:00.090
BRADY HARAN: Have you ever
been to the Eiffel Tower?

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:02.190
I guess that they're asking
that because of the Eiffel

00:40:02.190 --> 00:40:02.950
Tower picture behind.

00:40:02.950 --> 00:40:04.420
This is actually my
office, of course.

00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:05.060
So that would have
nothing to do--

00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.770
JAMES GRIME: So yeah, you
should ask Brady that.

00:40:06.770 --> 00:40:08.045
And I haven't been to
the Eiffel Tower.

00:40:08.045 --> 00:40:09.346
BRADY HARAN: You've never been
to the Eiffel Tower?

00:40:09.346 --> 00:40:13.030
JAMES GRIME: No, I haven't
been to Paris.

00:40:13.030 --> 00:40:14.880
Look at this case.

00:40:14.880 --> 00:40:15.220
BRADY HARAN: It's very close.

00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:16.100
JAMES GRIME: Look at his face.

00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:17.670
BRADY HARAN: It's very
close to here.

00:40:17.670 --> 00:40:18.875
I mean, I grew up in Australia
and I went

00:40:18.875 --> 00:40:22.110
to the Eiffel Tower.

00:40:22.110 --> 00:40:24.360
Well, that's a good question
to ask you next then.

00:40:24.360 --> 00:40:25.410
Favorite country to visit?

00:40:25.410 --> 00:40:27.040
Because obviously you have
been to other countries.

00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:27.810
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:40:27.810 --> 00:40:29.330
BRADY HARAN: Even if you haven't
been to France, which

00:40:29.330 --> 00:40:32.350
is like a stone's throw away.

00:40:32.350 --> 00:40:33.330
JAMES GRIME: Favorite country.

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:38.500
Two of my favorite countries,
I like Austria, and I like

00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.750
Scandinavia, Sweden, Denmark.

00:40:40.750 --> 00:40:43.730
I lived in Denmark for
about eight months.

00:40:43.730 --> 00:40:44.790
BRADY HARAN: I didn't
know that.

00:40:44.790 --> 00:40:46.020
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:40:46.020 --> 00:40:47.270
[INAUDIBLE].

00:40:50.910 --> 00:40:52.600
That's for the Danish viewers.

00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:54.080
BRADY HARAN: Same from me.

00:40:54.080 --> 00:40:55.020
A lot of people, actually--

00:40:55.020 --> 00:40:57.050
I know these
what's-your-favorite things

00:40:57.050 --> 00:40:58.220
are a little bit boring.

00:40:58.220 --> 00:41:01.320
But we get asked them a lot, so
I should ask them, I guess.

00:41:01.320 --> 00:41:04.270
A lot of people have asked about
your favorite TV show.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:06.700
JAMES GRIME: Ooh, favorite
TV show.

00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.920
BRADY HARAN: And they've also
asked what you think about

00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.810
some TV shows that involve
numbers, like things like

00:41:11.810 --> 00:41:12.230
"Numb3rs."

00:41:12.230 --> 00:41:14.750
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, like
"Numb3rs." I've actually got

00:41:14.750 --> 00:41:15.900
"Numb3rs" on DVD.

00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:18.400
I've got the box set, because
I travel a lot.

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.070
So I get box sets and
I watch a lot of

00:41:21.070 --> 00:41:22.730
programs as I'm traveling.

00:41:22.730 --> 00:41:25.810
And I've got "Numb3rs."
I've actually seen the

00:41:25.810 --> 00:41:26.980
first couple of series.

00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:30.140
I'm told the first couple of
series is the best, and it

00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:31.040
goes downhill.

00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:33.505
So I've got that to
look forward to.

00:41:33.505 --> 00:41:35.530
And I liked what they did.

00:41:35.530 --> 00:41:40.300
So they were showing
mathematicians not as these

00:41:40.300 --> 00:41:43.510
people who can't communicate,
who are anti-social, and all

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:47.360
those horrible cliches
for mathematicians.

00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:51.360
They were showing a
mathematician who was

00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:55.135
brilliant and perfectly
sociable, and how his maths

00:41:55.135 --> 00:41:57.140
could help--

00:41:57.140 --> 00:41:58.920
in the shows-- help
them solve crimes.

00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:00.700
And the maths was good maths.

00:42:00.700 --> 00:42:02.260
It's all genuine maths.

00:42:02.260 --> 00:42:06.750
And it had mathematicians help
them come up with ideas and

00:42:06.750 --> 00:42:08.665
check it's good.

00:42:08.665 --> 00:42:10.640
BRADY HARAN: So it's got a
bit of a thumbs up then?

00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:12.910
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, I like
"Numb3rs." Well, what I've

00:42:12.910 --> 00:42:15.860
seen so far.

00:42:15.860 --> 00:42:17.845
BRADY HARAN: If I can
interrupt slightly.

00:42:17.845 --> 00:42:18.910
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:42:18.910 --> 00:42:22.460
BRADY HARAN: Someone has asked,
while I'm with you,

00:42:22.460 --> 00:42:26.370
possibly having a Chinese and
not with Mrs. "Numberphile" on

00:42:26.370 --> 00:42:27.810
Valentine's Day--

00:42:27.810 --> 00:42:29.070
and this is a fair point.

00:42:29.070 --> 00:42:31.700
And you have mentioned some of
your favorite YouTubers, so

00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.140
this is a chance for me
to get a message out.

00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:37.530
If you would like to subscribe
to a channel and make Mrs.

00:42:37.530 --> 00:42:41.840
"Numberphile" very happy,
subscribe to Kylie Caravan.

00:42:41.840 --> 00:42:46.100
Kylie, K-Y-L-I-E, Caravan,
C-A-R-A--

00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:47.976
you know how to spell
"caravan."

00:42:47.976 --> 00:42:51.060
Go and subscribe to her, and
then there'll be this big--

00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.560
it's a brand-new channel.

00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.055
And I'm helping the video,
so it's got that touch

00:42:56.055 --> 00:42:57.890
of class about it.

00:42:57.890 --> 00:43:00.370
But if there's a sudden spike
in subscribers on there

00:43:00.370 --> 00:43:04.250
because of all you guys, that
will be Valentine's present

00:43:04.250 --> 00:43:04.870
taken care of.

00:43:04.870 --> 00:43:06.160
Kylie Caravan.

00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:08.780
Getting back to the man.

00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:12.290
By the way, James has been
ridiculously sick for the last

00:43:12.290 --> 00:43:12.920
week and a half.

00:43:12.920 --> 00:43:15.330
That's the reason he wasn't
able to take part in our--

00:43:15.330 --> 00:43:16.140
JAMES GRIME: This is a
good point to cough.

00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:16.640
BRADY HARAN: --biggest prime--

00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:16.780
OK.

00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:17.850
JAMES GRIME: [COUGHS]

00:43:17.850 --> 00:43:19.255
BRADY HARAN: That's why he
didn't take part in our

00:43:19.255 --> 00:43:20.040
biggest prime number video.

00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.420
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:43:20.420 --> 00:43:21.152
I was really annoyed.

00:43:21.152 --> 00:43:23.820
BRADY HARAN: And it's amazing
that he's even come here today

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:25.060
to help out [INAUDIBLE].

00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:27.360
You've been really struggling
during filming, and this is--

00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.240
obviously the web cam has just
brought you to life.

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.960
So kudos to you for
doing this.

00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:34.240
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, that's
Dr. Theater, isn't it?

00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:35.510
But I was ill.

00:43:35.510 --> 00:43:37.460
And I was really disappointed
not to be in the prime number

00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:40.201
video last week, because
I really did want

00:43:40.201 --> 00:43:41.284
to be in that one.

00:43:41.284 --> 00:43:42.320
BRADY HARAN: Oh, I like that.

00:43:42.320 --> 00:43:44.516
Do you prefer even
or odd numbers?

00:43:44.516 --> 00:43:45.965
JAMES GRIME: That's
a good question.

00:43:48.831 --> 00:43:50.540
Even the fact that I said
that was a good

00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:53.060
question is a bit nerdy.

00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.560
Do you know what?

00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.365
Off instinct, even numbers.

00:43:56.365 --> 00:43:58.315
What does that say about me?

00:43:58.315 --> 00:44:00.310
BRADY HARAN: You like
even numbers.

00:44:00.310 --> 00:44:02.200
JAMES GRIME: I like order.

00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.540
That's what it says about
me, isn't it?

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:04.970
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, I probably
would've thought you'd say

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:06.660
even, because your favorite
color was yellow.

00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:09.030
You're more the kind of the
happy, nice-- you're not an

00:44:09.030 --> 00:44:11.230
edgy odd-number kind of guy.

00:44:11.230 --> 00:44:12.820
JAMES GRIME: Off-kilter
sort of person, no.

00:44:12.820 --> 00:44:14.620
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.700
Someone has asked, do you
have your own channel?

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.960
For those who didn't see the
very start, and for those who

00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:21.040
don't already watch James' other
channel, it's called

00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:22.410
singingbanana.

00:44:22.410 --> 00:44:24.920
And he's been doing that for
about five years now.

00:44:24.920 --> 00:44:26.560
And it's an ex--

00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:30.440
watch my videos first, but if
you want to see James' own

00:44:30.440 --> 00:44:32.435
channel and him doing a few of
his own things, you can go on

00:44:32.435 --> 00:44:33.100
to singingbanana.

00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:34.490
JAMES GRIME: It's home-made.

00:44:34.490 --> 00:44:36.290
BRADY HARAN: As long as you've
also subscribed to Kylie

00:44:36.290 --> 00:44:38.740
Caravan, of course, because
it's Valentine's Day.

00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:40.710
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, reduce your
expectations, because it's a

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.330
home-made channel.

00:44:42.330 --> 00:44:44.625
BRADY HARAN: Yours is more,
yeah-- it's more, yeah

00:44:44.625 --> 00:44:44.910
[INAUDIBLE].

00:44:44.910 --> 00:44:46.700
JAMES GRIME: And it's
like, old-school

00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:49.605
YouTube, I like to think.

00:44:49.605 --> 00:44:51.160
I'm just a YouTuber.

00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.480
I am one of you.

00:44:55.840 --> 00:44:57.130
BRADY HARAN: There's another
question that's come up a

00:44:57.130 --> 00:44:57.760
couple of times.

00:44:57.760 --> 00:44:59.830
And it's a question for you, but
it's also maybe the birth

00:44:59.830 --> 00:45:02.300
of a future video I've been
thinking about anyway, and

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:04.100
I've been waning to talk
to people about anyway.

00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:09.190
Some people have asked what math
or mathematics jokes or

00:45:09.190 --> 00:45:11.330
one-liners and that you
like and don't like.

00:45:11.330 --> 00:45:12.925
And I know you love
corny jokes.

00:45:12.925 --> 00:45:16.680
But I was thinking we should do
a mathematics joke video.

00:45:16.680 --> 00:45:18.940
So if you've got any maths jokes
that you like or don't

00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:20.260
like, put them in
the description.

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:21.080
JAMES GRIME: Send
them to Brady.

00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:22.200
BRADY HARAN: Put them
in the description.

00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:23.965
JAMES GRIME: He loves them.

00:45:23.965 --> 00:45:25.960
BRADY HARAN: No, but I think
they'd make a good video.

00:45:25.960 --> 00:45:28.670
But I know you like
a corny joke.

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.670
And you must know a few.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:32.580
Are there any?

00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.212
JAMES GRIME: Take epsilon
less than zero.

00:45:35.212 --> 00:45:37.370
There you go, that's one for
the math [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:37.370 --> 00:45:38.630
BRADY HARAN: What did you say?

00:45:38.630 --> 00:45:41.310
JAMES GRIME: Take epsilon
less than zero.

00:45:41.310 --> 00:45:43.300
That is killing.

00:45:43.300 --> 00:45:48.100
In all the maths departments
across the world, that is

00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:48.970
slaying them.

00:45:48.970 --> 00:45:50.370
BRADY HARAN: Really, really?

00:45:50.370 --> 00:45:51.270
JAMES GRIME: They
are loving that.

00:45:51.270 --> 00:45:52.880
That is going down a storm.

00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:54.300
BRADY HARAN: Let's have
a look at the current.

00:45:54.300 --> 00:45:56.530
James, are you really
singingbanana?

00:45:56.530 --> 00:45:56.910
Is that--

00:45:56.910 --> 00:45:58.540
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:45:58.540 --> 00:45:58.880
BRADY HARAN: [INAUDIBLE].

00:45:58.880 --> 00:45:59.500
JAMES GRIME: Well, yeah.

00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:00.645
I am the singingbanana
channel.

00:46:00.645 --> 00:46:01.770
I am singingbanana.

00:46:01.770 --> 00:46:05.500
You see a comment by
singingbanana, that's me.

00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:07.110
I'm not a singing
banana myself.

00:46:07.110 --> 00:46:08.840
I'm just his agent.

00:46:08.840 --> 00:46:11.030
BRADY HARAN: Why do
mathematicians always confuse

00:46:11.030 --> 00:46:12.240
Halloween and Christmas?

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:13.060
Is that a maths joke?

00:46:13.060 --> 00:46:19.018
JAMES GRIME: Yes, because
Oct31 equals Dec25.

00:46:19.018 --> 00:46:20.670
BRADY HARAN: That's good.

00:46:20.670 --> 00:46:21.750
That's the kind of
stuff I like.

00:46:21.750 --> 00:46:23.690
JAMES GRIME: That's the level
you're working at.

00:46:23.690 --> 00:46:25.030
BRADY HARAN: That's actually
good, thought.

00:46:25.030 --> 00:46:28.700
I also don't mind the, you know,
because seven ate nine

00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:29.320
type jokes.

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:30.870
I like those corny ones, too.

00:46:30.870 --> 00:46:32.720
But that I quite liked.

00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:40.330
Do you watch Dara O'Brien's
"School of Hard Sums?" Which

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.050
I've never seen.

00:46:41.050 --> 00:46:42.300
JAMES GRIME: Yeah, I've seen
a couple of those shows.

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:43.050
I've not seen them all.

00:46:43.050 --> 00:46:44.150
I've seen a couple
of those shows.

00:46:44.150 --> 00:46:46.895
Dara O Briain is a comedian
in the UK.

00:46:46.895 --> 00:46:48.680
He's Irish and South.

00:46:48.680 --> 00:46:52.060
And he actually did a maths
degree in [INAUDIBLE]

00:46:52.060 --> 00:46:53.230
mathematical physics.

00:46:53.230 --> 00:46:55.290
So he's from a mathematical
background.

00:46:55.290 --> 00:47:00.190
He's got a TV show in the UK
called "School of Hard Sums."

00:47:00.190 --> 00:47:02.260
It's mixing maths with comedy.

00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:05.550
It's also with Marcus du Sautoy,
who's a mathematician.

00:47:05.550 --> 00:47:07.340
He's great as well.

00:47:07.340 --> 00:47:09.970
I've actually helped them out,
a couple of weeks ago.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:11.600
They wanted to do something
about Enigma

00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.130
machines and codes.

00:47:13.130 --> 00:47:15.230
So I went down and
helped them out.

00:47:15.230 --> 00:47:16.480
I'm not on tele.

00:47:16.480 --> 00:47:18.140
They didn't want me on tele.

00:47:18.140 --> 00:47:21.035
They didn't want
this on the TV.

00:47:21.035 --> 00:47:21.840
BRADY HARAN: No.

00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:24.660
I phoned them up and actually
sabotaged you, because I'm

00:47:24.660 --> 00:47:26.415
trying to get you on an
exclusivity deal for

00:47:26.415 --> 00:47:27.562
"Numberphile".

00:47:27.562 --> 00:47:30.310
JAMES GRIME: I'll shake
my fist at you.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.010
But I did help them out.

00:47:32.010 --> 00:47:35.700
The Enigma machine, when that
is aired-- and I don't know

00:47:35.700 --> 00:47:36.450
when that's gonna be.

00:47:36.450 --> 00:47:40.050
The Enigma machine is the one I
look after, which belongs to

00:47:40.050 --> 00:47:40.900
Simon Singh.

00:47:40.900 --> 00:47:44.986
And the stuff that Marcus says
is the kind of stuff that I

00:47:44.986 --> 00:47:46.560
fed him as well.

00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:49.572
So hello to Marcus and Dara.

00:47:49.572 --> 00:47:51.440
BRADY HARAN: I don't think
they watch "Numberphile",

00:47:51.440 --> 00:47:52.130
personally.

00:47:52.130 --> 00:47:53.480
JAMES GRIME: You might
be surprised.

00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:54.080
BRADY HARAN: Really?

00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:56.090
I know their producers
do, to steal ideas.

00:47:56.090 --> 00:47:57.610
But I don't think their--

00:47:57.610 --> 00:47:58.870
JAMES GRIME: You may
be surprised.

00:47:58.870 --> 00:48:01.920
Yeah, their producers do.

00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.676
Marcus said, get James
in because he

00:48:04.676 --> 00:48:05.910
has an Enigma machine.

00:48:05.910 --> 00:48:07.660
And the producer contacted me.

00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:09.040
They said, hello.

00:48:09.040 --> 00:48:11.340
Marcus told us to say hello.

00:48:11.340 --> 00:48:12.410
And she knew who I was.

00:48:12.410 --> 00:48:14.565
I said, I do this thing
called "Numberphile".

00:48:14.565 --> 00:48:16.110
And she watches.

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:20.670
She didn't quite connect my
name to me, but yeah, she

00:48:20.670 --> 00:48:20.950
watches too.

00:48:20.950 --> 00:48:22.140
So hi.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.380
BRADY HARAN: A question.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:25.090
Just because this has been
asked so many times, I

00:48:25.090 --> 00:48:25.880
probably should ask it.

00:48:25.880 --> 00:48:29.670
A lot of people wanna know
if you play "Minecraft."

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:31.200
JAMES GRIME: I think
I've heard of it.

00:48:31.200 --> 00:48:35.020
So obviously I don't play
"Minecraft." Sorry, I don't.

00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:35.770
BRADY HARAN: It's all right.

00:48:35.770 --> 00:48:37.630
We're all friends here.

00:48:37.630 --> 00:48:39.090
Someone says-- this is
a good question.

00:48:39.090 --> 00:48:41.390
Are you creative?

00:48:41.390 --> 00:48:43.465
JAMES GRIME: Right, I see.

00:48:43.465 --> 00:48:44.040
Do you know what?

00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:47.955
That's kind of leading me down
a road where there's a speech

00:48:47.955 --> 00:48:50.850
down this road, about maths
being creative.

00:48:50.850 --> 00:48:51.930
BRADY HARAN: Go on then.

00:48:51.930 --> 00:48:52.240
JAMES GRIME: No.

00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:53.480
Maybe I'll just [INAUDIBLE].

00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.080
Maybe I'll make it simple
and just say--

00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:55.940
BRADY HARAN: Yeah, go on.

00:48:55.940 --> 00:48:57.290
JAMES GRIME: From my point
of view, maths

00:48:57.290 --> 00:48:58.826
is a creative subject.

00:48:58.826 --> 00:49:02.270
I mean, creating new
mathematics, mathematics

00:49:02.270 --> 00:49:06.330
that's never been done before,
original, new mathematics, is

00:49:06.330 --> 00:49:07.850
a creative process.

00:49:07.850 --> 00:49:09.650
You don't do that
by just being a

00:49:09.650 --> 00:49:11.830
robot, by being a machine.

00:49:11.830 --> 00:49:13.300
I truly believe that.

00:49:13.300 --> 00:49:16.960
And that's something I want
to show people as well.

00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.490
BRADY HARAN: Tell
me about how a

00:49:18.490 --> 00:49:20.640
mathematician is creative then.

00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:20.780
JAMES GRIME: Right.

00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.380
So when I discover something,
yeah, I

00:49:22.380 --> 00:49:23.460
discover something new.

00:49:23.460 --> 00:49:26.880
So let's say I want to
prove something.

00:49:26.880 --> 00:49:30.380
First of all, I have to come
up with a conjecture.

00:49:30.380 --> 00:49:32.170
And that's a leap
of intuition.

00:49:32.170 --> 00:49:33.225
BRADY HARAN: Is that
like a hypothesis?

00:49:33.225 --> 00:49:34.900
JAMES GRIME: Yes, a hypothesis,
exactly.

00:49:34.900 --> 00:49:36.350
So that's a leap of intuition.

00:49:36.350 --> 00:49:38.170
That's somewhere I
want to get to.

00:49:38.170 --> 00:49:40.850
And that's a creative,
intuitive thing.

00:49:40.850 --> 00:49:45.690
But then to prove it, I'm
assuming that other people

00:49:45.690 --> 00:49:47.580
have not yet been able
to solve it.

00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:49.870
So you're solving problems
that other

00:49:49.870 --> 00:49:51.745
people could not solve.

00:49:51.745 --> 00:49:53.480
And that's amazing.

00:49:53.480 --> 00:49:54.020
That's brilliant.

00:49:54.020 --> 00:49:57.320
And to solve it, you might take
something from over here,

00:49:57.320 --> 00:50:00.070
you take an idea from over
there, and then you put these

00:50:00.070 --> 00:50:01.360
things together.

00:50:01.360 --> 00:50:04.080
You put them together in a new
way, in a way that's never

00:50:04.080 --> 00:50:05.090
been done before.

00:50:05.090 --> 00:50:07.030
And you create something.

00:50:07.030 --> 00:50:10.670
You create something new,
something that's never been

00:50:10.670 --> 00:50:12.340
done before.

00:50:12.340 --> 00:50:12.940
BRADY HARAN: Cool.

00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:13.280
JAMES GRIME: Yeah.

00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:14.660
And then that's true forever.

00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:17.202
And that's one of the amazing
things about it as well.

00:50:17.202 --> 00:50:19.400
BRADY HARAN: Someone wants to
know how long this stream is

00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:20.200
going to be.

00:50:20.200 --> 00:50:22.240
They could watch it all day.

00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:23.170
JAMES GRIME: That's
up to you, Brady.

00:50:23.170 --> 00:50:24.870
BRADY HARAN: Well,
I don't know.

00:50:24.870 --> 00:50:26.020
You do have a train to catch.

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.170
JAMES GRIME: I do
have a train.

00:50:26.170 --> 00:50:27.210
BRADY HARAN: Unless
you're gonna stay

00:50:27.210 --> 00:50:28.230
around for that Chinese.

00:50:28.230 --> 00:50:30.240
But we won't be able to go
for too much longer.

00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:31.250
JAMES GRIME: No, not too
much longer, maybe

00:50:31.250 --> 00:50:32.000
five minutes longer.

00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:33.386
BRADY HARAN: Yeah.

00:50:33.386 --> 00:50:36.140
Let's have a look.

00:50:36.140 --> 00:50:38.890
Do you prefer hot
or cold weather?

00:50:38.890 --> 00:50:39.760
JAMES GRIME: Cold weather.

00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.740
There you go.

00:50:40.740 --> 00:50:42.000
BRADY HARAN: I prefer
cold weather, too.

00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:43.110
JAMES GRIME: There's a
surprise; I had an

00:50:43.110 --> 00:50:43.570
answer for that one.

00:50:43.570 --> 00:50:44.820
Cold weather.

00:50:46.970 --> 00:50:48.940
BRADY HARAN: Do you
like sushi?

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:50.640
JAMES GRIME: I don't think
I've ever tried it.

00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:51.526
I'm sorry.

00:50:51.526 --> 00:50:53.335
BRADY HARAN: You've
never had sushi?

00:50:53.335 --> 00:50:54.050
JAMES GRIME: Don't
think I have.

00:50:54.050 --> 00:50:55.390
BRADY HARAN: You've never had
sushi, and you've never been

00:50:55.390 --> 00:50:56.390
to the Eiffel Tower.

00:50:56.390 --> 00:50:58.640
JAMES GRIME: I've never
had sushi at the

00:50:58.640 --> 00:50:59.460
Eiffel Tower either.

00:50:59.460 --> 00:51:00.462
BRADY HARAN: That's what
you should, though.

00:51:00.462 --> 00:51:01.712
That would be awesome.

00:51:03.830 --> 00:51:06.570
Is there going to be
a Grime conjecture?

00:51:06.570 --> 00:51:07.530
JAMES GRIME: Grime conjecture.

00:51:07.530 --> 00:51:09.160
There's a Grime corollary.

00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:11.150
BRADY HARAN: Is that another
Grime, or is that yours?

00:51:11.150 --> 00:51:11.550
JAMES GRIME: No, that's me.

00:51:11.550 --> 00:51:14.000
BRADY HARAN: What's
the Grime corr--

00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:16.530
what is it?

00:51:16.530 --> 00:51:17.870
JAMES GRIME: It's only
a little bit of fun.

00:51:17.870 --> 00:51:19.120
It's only a little thing.

00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:21.840
But there was a episode of
"Futurama" where they were

00:51:21.840 --> 00:51:23.550
swapping brains.

00:51:23.550 --> 00:51:24.540
Have you seen it?

00:51:24.540 --> 00:51:25.220
BRADY HARAN: I haven't, no.

00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:26.580
JAMES GRIME: All right, so they
had this brain-swapping

00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:29.530
machine, so they could swap
brains, swap minds.

00:51:29.530 --> 00:51:30.380
But they couldn't
swap them back.

00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:32.340
Once they're swapped, couldn't
be swapped back.

00:51:32.340 --> 00:51:32.860
BRADY HARAN: One-time deal.

00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.910
JAMES GRIME: So they were
all swapping brains.

00:51:35.910 --> 00:51:37.696
And they were all mixed up.

00:51:37.696 --> 00:51:39.940
And they go, oh, no, how
are we going to get

00:51:39.940 --> 00:51:41.210
back to where we were?

00:51:41.210 --> 00:51:43.592
Because you can't just
reverse the steps.

00:51:43.592 --> 00:51:44.810
And so--

00:51:44.810 --> 00:51:45.870
and this is brilliant.

00:51:45.870 --> 00:51:48.270
The guy who wrote the
episode was a maths

00:51:48.270 --> 00:51:50.490
graduate himself, Keeler.

00:51:50.490 --> 00:51:51.770
He was called Keeler.

00:51:51.770 --> 00:51:57.900
And he actually wrote a theorem
so that you could do

00:51:57.900 --> 00:51:58.965
this in general.

00:51:58.965 --> 00:52:00.880
And it's in the episode.

00:52:00.880 --> 00:52:05.430
Someone shot on a blackboard
in the cartoon how to

00:52:05.430 --> 00:52:07.360
do it in real life.

00:52:07.360 --> 00:52:09.340
And I made a little-- and
it's true, and it works.

00:52:09.340 --> 00:52:11.010
And I made a little conjecture
about it.

00:52:11.010 --> 00:52:15.290
Well, in that example that was
in "Futurama," you could have

00:52:15.290 --> 00:52:19.210
actually done it
in fewer moves.

00:52:19.210 --> 00:52:20.620
BRADY HARAN: It sounds like
a "Numberphile" video.

00:52:20.620 --> 00:52:22.590
JAMES GRIME: It's a
little fun thing.

00:52:22.590 --> 00:52:23.290
BRADY HARAN: That sounds
like it could be a

00:52:23.290 --> 00:52:24.680
"Numberphile" video.

00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.360
Tell you what, we better
things wrap things.

00:52:26.360 --> 00:52:27.210
JAMES GRIME: All right.

00:52:27.210 --> 00:52:31.400
BRADY HARAN: But we'll read
through all the comments and

00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:32.870
things that you've
written later on.

00:52:32.870 --> 00:52:35.070
And I'll certainly go
in and have a chat

00:52:35.070 --> 00:52:35.940
when I get the chance.

00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.650
It's not always easy to reply to
comments in these different

00:52:38.650 --> 00:52:39.350
comment sections.

00:52:39.350 --> 00:52:40.990
But I think we'll find
a way to do it.

00:52:40.990 --> 00:52:43.290
And James may or may
not as well.

00:52:43.290 --> 00:52:46.110
His username is singingbanana.

00:52:46.110 --> 00:52:51.030
And don't forget this, this
other idiot, who's using

00:52:51.030 --> 00:52:53.370
James' picture and calling
himself James Grime and

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:54.130
writing here.

00:52:54.130 --> 00:52:58.440
And if you see him, do
whatever you can.

00:52:58.440 --> 00:52:59.130
What do you call it?

00:52:59.130 --> 00:53:00.795
Flame him, or thumb him down.

00:53:00.795 --> 00:53:01.640
JAMES GRIME: Thumbs down.

00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.210
BRADY HARAN: Make sure everyone
knows that that guy

00:53:03.210 --> 00:53:05.260
is a bit of an impostor.

00:53:05.260 --> 00:53:06.210
Yeah, I don't know.

00:53:06.210 --> 00:53:08.378
JAMES GRIME: Hang on, don't
set the angry mob on him.

00:53:08.378 --> 00:53:09.740
BRADY HARAN: No, no, no.

00:53:09.740 --> 00:53:10.270
Yeah, sorry.

00:53:10.270 --> 00:53:11.680
Don't be angry.

00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:14.690
But don't let other people think
it's James, because--

00:53:14.690 --> 00:53:15.590
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:15.590 --> 00:53:16.330
BRADY HARAN: Because it's not.

00:53:16.330 --> 00:53:18.590
James is singingbanana,
as you know.

00:53:18.590 --> 00:53:21.660
And don't forget to subscribe
to Kylie Caravan and make my

00:53:21.660 --> 00:53:25.120
Valentine's Day much easier.

00:53:25.120 --> 00:53:25.840
Thank you.

00:53:25.840 --> 00:53:26.820
JAMES GRIME: Glad to help.

00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.170
BRADY HARAN: Thank you, James,
for coming along.

00:53:30.170 --> 00:53:33.830
And as I said, we filmed a bunch
of "Numberphile" videos

00:53:33.830 --> 00:53:34.410
earlier as well.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:36.190
So you're gonna be seeing
plenty of James.

00:53:36.190 --> 00:53:38.225
Even though I'm not going to be
seeing much of James over

00:53:38.225 --> 00:53:39.140
the next month or two--

00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.110
JAMES GRIME: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:40.110 --> 00:53:41.920
BRADY HARAN: --you will
still be seeing him on

00:53:41.920 --> 00:53:42.890
"Numberphile".

00:53:42.890 --> 00:53:44.390
I'm not seeing him
because he's just

00:53:44.390 --> 00:53:45.580
really busy with work.

00:53:45.580 --> 00:53:47.740
But we'll catch him again in
the middle of the year.

00:53:47.740 --> 00:53:50.040
But you will keep seeing
him on "Numberphile".

00:53:50.040 --> 00:53:52.490
And it was good fun.

00:53:52.490 --> 00:53:53.980
I actually really enj--
did you enjoy it?

00:53:53.980 --> 00:53:54.880
JAMES GRIME: Yeah,
it was good fun.

00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:58.430
You know, I'm my own favorite
subject, so I could have done

00:53:58.430 --> 00:54:00.660
that till the cows come home.

00:54:00.660 --> 00:54:02.770
But I think now's a good
time to wrap it up.

00:54:02.770 --> 00:54:03.140
BRADY HARAN: Cool.

00:54:03.140 --> 00:54:06.090
And we'll hope to more of these
kind of things, both

00:54:06.090 --> 00:54:08.400
with James and with others,
and with multiple people,

00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.110
because it's good fun.

00:54:10.110 --> 00:54:11.960
It's really good fun talking
to you guys in real time.

00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:13.130
So cheers, everyone.

00:54:13.130 --> 00:54:13.660
JAMES GRIME: Thanks
for watching.

00:54:13.660 --> 00:54:14.910
BRADY HARAN: See you later.
