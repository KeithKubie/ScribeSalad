00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:04.100
So we now know that there are
two ways that a company can

00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:05.440
raise capital.

00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:10.120
It can do it by borrowing
money, which is debt.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.970
Or by selling shares of
itself, or essentially

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:15.230
allowing other people to become
partial owners of it,

00:00:15.230 --> 00:00:17.330
and that is equity.

00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:20.620
And these directly translate
into securities, that you're

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.930
probably familiar with, but
maybe you didn't have a more

00:00:23.930 --> 00:00:25.940
exact idea of what they are.

00:00:25.940 --> 00:00:27.725
You know what equity securities
are, and just so

00:00:27.725 --> 00:00:28.730
you know, what is a security?

00:00:28.730 --> 00:00:30.630
A security is essentially
something that can be bought

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.610
and sold that has some type of
claim on something, or some

00:00:33.610 --> 00:00:35.270
type of economic value.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:39.750
So a security in the equity
world is a stock.

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.250
And a security in the debt
world is a bond.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:45.110
Let me explain it.

00:00:45.110 --> 00:00:48.310
So let me just draw the
balance sheet for the

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:49.785
fictional company.

00:00:49.785 --> 00:00:52.890
It was pointed out to me that
socks.com actually is not a

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:53.620
fictional company.

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:55.700
That someone is indeed
selling socks online.

00:00:59.020 --> 00:01:01.630
Which, by the way, I think
is a great idea.

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.430
So let's see, I have my
assets right here.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.615
These are the assets
of the company.

00:01:07.615 --> 00:01:11.790
But that's not what we're
worried about right now.

00:01:11.790 --> 00:01:16.170
And let me draw the equity
of the company.

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:19.190
This is maybe shares
that they sold.

00:01:19.190 --> 00:01:22.220
So let's say that they
have-- that there

00:01:22.220 --> 00:01:26.410
are 10 million shares.

00:01:26.410 --> 00:01:30.450
And then we have the debt, the
debt of the company, or the

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:31.070
liabilities.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:34.000
There are other liabilities
other than debt, per se, but

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.380
that's all we'll worry
about right now.

00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:36.080
This is the debt.

00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.330
I'll do it in brown.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:40.600
We have the debt.

00:01:43.420 --> 00:01:45.550
And maybe the assets-- let me
just think of a good round

00:01:45.550 --> 00:01:49.490
number-- the assets are
$10 million in assets.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:55.440
And let's say our debt
is $6 million.

00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:58.560
And then what's left over for
the equity-- and the way you

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.870
have to view it is OK, if I
have $10 million and I owe

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:04.700
people $6 million, what's left
for the owners of the company?

00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:05.840
Well, the owners of
the company will

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:09.220
have $4 million left.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:13.220
And it will be split amongst
the owners of the company.

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.000
And there's 10 million
individual shares.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.830
So every person who has one of
those stock certificates will

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.850
own one ten-millionth of this
$4 million, or essentially,

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.590
$0.40 a share, or something.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:26.680
So anyway, this is-- and I think
you're familiar with

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:31.030
this already-- this is
essentially stock.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:32.870
When we say 10 million
shares, that's 10

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.550
million shares of stock.

00:02:34.550 --> 00:02:38.640
I could just draw 10 million
stock certificates.

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.960
And, I guess, whatever
the ticker symbol is.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.650
And there could be 10
million of those.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.980
Now debt is interesting.

00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.620
There's a lot of ways you can
raise debt, and actually

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:49.530
there's a lot of ways you
could raise equity, it

00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:51.540
actually doesn't have
to be with selling.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.950
Well, for the most part
you are selling stock.

00:02:53.950 --> 00:02:55.640
You could maybe think of some
other way, and we'll talk

00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.230
about other forms of
equity, preferred

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:58.250
stock and all of that.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:02:59.700
But in the simplest level,
you're really

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:01.100
always selling stock.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.330
Debt's a little different.

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:05.320
Debt could be just in the
form of a bank loan.

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:09.990
So this could be a bank loan,
where you literally go to the

00:03:09.990 --> 00:03:13.620
bank and say hey, I need $6
million, and they say OK, here

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:16.400
you go, and we'll give it to you
for this interest. And you

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:19.000
have to pay back the money,
above and beyond the interest,

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.070
over this time schedule.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.320
So it's not too different
than maybe a mortgage.

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:25.050
Or they might say OK, you pay
the interest for five years,

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.900
and at the end of the five years
you also have to pay the

00:03:28.900 --> 00:03:29.780
principal amount.

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:31.030
So you have to pay the
whole $6 million.

00:03:31.030 --> 00:03:32.750
Or you maybe have to come
up with a new loan or

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:33.270
something like that.

00:03:33.270 --> 00:03:34.710
So that would just
be a bank loan.

00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.440
There's other things that are
revolving lines of credit,

00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.960
which is kind of like a
company's credit card to some

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:44.170
degree, that it doesn't
have to use it.

00:03:44.170 --> 00:03:47.120
But if it does, that's kind of
debt the company takes on.

00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:49.950
But kind of the one that people
always talk about, I

00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.120
guess in the same phrase,
is bonds.

00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:58.190
So bonds are-- essentially you
are borrowing from the public

00:03:58.190 --> 00:03:58.890
markets again.

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.440
You are borrowing from
a bunch of people.

00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:04.340
So what you do is you have,
let's say, the $6 million.

00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:09.380
And it could be divided into--
you could divide this into

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:12.560
6,000 bond certificates.

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.390
So this could be 6,000 bond
certificates-- let me see, and

00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.060
six million divided by 6,000,
that's a thousand, right?

00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:26.450
So it's going to be 6,000
times $1,000 bond

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.700
certificates.

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:34.140
And let's visualize what a bond

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:35.960
certificate could look like.

00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.280
So that could be a
bond certificate.

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:40.340
And its face value, and
sometimes they'll call it the

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:42.300
par value, or the
stated value.

00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:48.270
It'll say-- let's call it
bond from Company XYZ.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.060
And it's face value is $1,000.

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.490
So it's essentially-- this is
an IOU from Company XYZ.

00:04:55.490 --> 00:04:58.530
If I were to hold one of these,
if I had one of these

00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:01.640
sitting on my desk right now,
that tells me that Company XYZ

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:06.150
is going to pay me $1,000
at some future date.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:08.210
And that future date
is at maturity.

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:17.700
So it's going to pay
$1,000 at maturity.

00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.260
And you say oh, well, Sal,
that's all good, but what

00:05:20.260 --> 00:05:21.970
about the interest in between?

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:24.820
And there's two ways to
think about this.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:27.820
Maybe they're going to pay me
$1000 in the future, but I

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:30.150
only had to give them
$500, right?

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.730
So, if you think about it,
there's automatically interest

00:05:32.730 --> 00:05:33.800
accruing in that.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:38.700
If I gave them $500 and then
five years later they pay me

00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:40.990
$1000, they are essentially
paying interest, right?

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.020
They're paying me more back
than I gave to them.

00:05:43.020 --> 00:05:45.560
And in future videos we'll
actually do the math of how to

00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:47.200
figure out that type
of interest.

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:49.450
In that situation, where they're
not kind of paying me

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:52.770
interest as they go, this would
be viewed as a zero

00:05:52.770 --> 00:05:54.180
coupon bond.

00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.660
And I know I'm throwing out a
lot of terminology, but it'll

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:57.810
all make sense to you
to in a second.

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:00.910
So zero coupon essentially
means they're not paying

00:06:00.910 --> 00:06:04.240
interest until they pay
off the whole loan.

00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.930
And then they might kind of--
the interest will be implicit

00:06:06.930 --> 00:06:08.455
in the whole value amount.

00:06:08.455 --> 00:06:10.470
And I kind of jumped the
gun a little bit.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:14.150
But coupon is essentially a
regular payment on the bond

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.140
that the company makes, in this
case XYZ will make, that

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:19.320
is essentially-- you can almost
view it as a kind of

00:06:19.320 --> 00:06:19.740
interest.

00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:21.940
But if you really had to figure
out the interest that

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.910
you're getting on the bond,
you'd actually have to

00:06:23.910 --> 00:06:26.680
figure-- and I'll do maybe
a whole playlist on bond

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:28.780
mathematics-- you would have to
figure out-- It's based on

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.830
the coupon, what you gave them,
and then what they're

00:06:31.830 --> 00:06:33.460
going to pay you, and when
they're going to do it.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:35.190
So it's a little bit more
complicated than just saying,

00:06:35.190 --> 00:06:38.970
oh, look at that, they're giving
a 6% coupon, which

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:42.210
essentially means twice a year
they're going to give me 3% of

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:44.000
the value of my bond.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.940
So just as the big
picture, both of

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.820
these things are traded.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:51.110
This is a stock, it's
traded on exchange.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.060
You're probably familiar that.

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:52.730
If you go to Yahoo!

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.380
Finance, you type in the ticker
symbol and you get the

00:06:55.380 --> 00:06:56.840
price for that day.

00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.270
Bonds are also traded.

00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:01.470
Unfortunately, it's not as easy
to get a quote on a bond.

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:02.720
Usually you have to
have a Bloomberg

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.950
terminal of some type.

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:04.980
You can't get it on Yahoo!

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:08.370
Finance, and I think that's
by design, by bond traders

00:07:08.370 --> 00:07:12.570
because they probably don't like
the transparency there.

00:07:12.570 --> 00:07:14.790
But it is just like a stock.

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:15.630
It is a security.

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:16.550
It is traded.

00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:18.050
There is a price.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.910
But then there's a very
fundamental difference in what

00:07:20.910 --> 00:07:23.050
the holder of the
bond is doing.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:27.950
In a bond, you essentially-- if
I'm holding a $1,000 bond,

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:29.590
that means that I've
lent some amount of

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:30.440
money to the company.

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.380
And it'll be in this
part of it.

00:07:32.380 --> 00:07:34.830
And as long as a company doesn't
go bankrupt, they'll

00:07:34.830 --> 00:07:37.460
pay me some interest and
pay me my money back.

00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:40.890
When I own a stock in the
company, I own a share of the

00:07:40.890 --> 00:07:43.270
equity, as opposed to a share of
the debt, which is the case

00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:44.550
with the bond.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.180
When I own a share of the
equity, the company's not

00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:49.050
promising to pay
back anything.

00:07:49.050 --> 00:07:52.450
It's just saying look, you are
a part owner of this company,

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:54.780
and anything that any of the
owners get, you'll get.

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:56.390
So if this company becomes
worth a lot.

00:07:56.390 --> 00:08:00.700
If we start dividending out
things to the shareholders,

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:01.570
then you'll get that.

00:08:01.570 --> 00:08:04.800
If the company gets sold by
someone and pays x dollars per

00:08:04.800 --> 00:08:06.270
share for it, you'll
get that money.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.050
And if the company
goes bankrupt,

00:08:08.050 --> 00:08:09.860
you'll also go bankrupt.

00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:11.490
So that actually leads to an
interesting question, if the

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:15.250
company goes bankrupt--
actually, let's do the

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:15.940
example right now.

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.250
Let's say the company
goes bankrupt.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:21.670
And I'll do a more in-depth
example of this.

00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:23.670
The question is, let's say the
company goes bankrupt.

00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:26.570
And people decide that it's not
operational anymore, that

00:08:26.570 --> 00:08:27.660
it just can't do business.

00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.590
Because there's actually two
types of bankruptcy.

00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:33.980
There's one where you say, oh,
the business is good, and just

00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:36.220
can't pay off it's debts.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:38.580
So we have to somehow
restructure this side of it.

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:40.700
And then the other type of
bankruptcy is liquidation,

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.740
where they say, you know what?

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:43.110
This business doesn't
even make sense

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:44.220
to operate any more.

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.430
Let's just sell off
all of the assets.

00:08:46.430 --> 00:08:48.560
So the question that I'll leave
you with in this video

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.000
is, what happens in a situation
where you enter

00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.690
bankruptcy?

00:08:51.690 --> 00:08:53.880
People want to liquidate
the assets.

00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:56.190
And let's say when you liquidate
the assets, there's

00:08:56.190 --> 00:08:59.720
only $8 million of assets.

00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:02.650
So, the question is, who do you
think is going to eat that

00:09:02.650 --> 00:09:03.590
$2 million.

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:06.470
Is it going to be the
debtholders, or the

00:09:06.470 --> 00:09:07.090
stockholders?

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:09.250
Who is going to lose their money
first, or you can almost

00:09:09.250 --> 00:09:12.630
say, who is more senior when it
comes to actually getting

00:09:12.630 --> 00:09:13.260
their money back?

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.290
And I'll leave you with that,
maybe to the next video, or a

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:18.360
future video that I'll
do on bankruptcy.

00:09:18.360 --> 00:09:19.610
See you in the next video.
