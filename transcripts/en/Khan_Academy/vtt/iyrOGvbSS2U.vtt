00:00:00.399 --> 00:00:03.884
Male voiceover: You might be wondering
why the exchange would be willing

00:00:03.884 --> 00:00:06.811
to take on the counter party
risk for people trained,

00:00:06.811 --> 00:00:11.599
exchanging these kinds of
standardized Futures Contract.

00:00:11.599 --> 00:00:14.006
The first reason is that
the exchange actually stands

00:00:14.006 --> 00:00:16.073
to make a lot of money.

00:00:16.073 --> 00:00:17.934
What he can do is tell these people

00:00:17.934 --> 00:00:19.935
who wanna buy apples in the future,

00:00:19.935 --> 00:00:24.994
he could say for example, "Hey, you
can enter into a Futures Contract

00:00:24.994 --> 00:00:28.438
" with a settlement price
of 22 cents per pound."

00:00:28.485 --> 00:00:31.263
So that's what they're going to
have to come to the table with.

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:35.604
That is 22 cents per pound
and he could tell the people

00:00:35.604 --> 00:00:37.068
who are gonna deliver the apples

00:00:37.068 --> 00:00:39.469
that when you deliver the apples,

00:00:39.469 --> 00:00:44.067
the settlement price
is 20 cents per pound.

00:00:44.067 --> 00:00:46.669
Essentially, when the settlement occurs,

00:00:46.669 --> 00:00:52.285
he's going to be able
to make a 2 cent profit.

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.273
Let me review that again.

00:00:54.273 --> 00:00:57.645
If he only has to pay these guys
20 cents a pound for the apples,

00:00:57.645 --> 00:01:01.879
and these guys are paying 22
cents a pound for the apples,

00:01:01.879 --> 00:01:04.263
maybe I should make this
arrow go in this direction

00:01:04.263 --> 00:01:06.074
because this is the flow
of the actual money.

00:01:06.074 --> 00:01:08.405
If these guys are going to
pay 22 cents for the apples

00:01:08.405 --> 00:01:10.019
and then as the exchange,

00:01:10.034 --> 00:01:12.346
this guy only has to give
20 cents to the farmers,

00:01:12.346 --> 00:01:14.343
he's going to make 2 cents profit.

00:01:14.343 --> 00:01:18.935
On Futures Contracts, on
1,000 pounds of apples

00:01:18.935 --> 00:01:21.813
that's going to be $20 for
each of those contracts.

00:01:21.813 --> 00:01:29.899
That's going to be $20 per contract

00:01:29.899 --> 00:01:31.607
and he's going to be
doing this night and day,

00:01:31.607 --> 00:01:33.408
trading with all of the different farmers

00:01:33.408 --> 00:01:34.891
and all of the different customers

00:01:34.891 --> 00:01:37.060
and even some speculators
who might wanna do this.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.378
So maybe if the spread, if we

00:01:39.378 --> 00:01:41.634
kind of can maintain this 2 cents spread,

00:01:41.634 --> 00:01:44.343
he'll keep making $20 every time one

00:01:44.343 --> 00:01:47.007
of these Futures Contracts exchange hands.

00:01:47.007 --> 00:01:49.240
Now, the other way that he's
going to protect himself

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.682
against losses is he's going to make each

00:01:51.682 --> 00:01:55.817
of these parties set
aside some money in case,

00:01:55.817 --> 00:01:59.784
the Futures Contract
price moves against them

00:01:59.784 --> 00:02:03.389
and this money that they have
to set aside is called Margin

00:02:03.389 --> 00:02:06.455
and I'll explain this in more
detail in the future video

00:02:06.455 --> 00:02:10.601
but what it essentially
is, is the amount of money

00:02:10.601 --> 00:02:16.456
that this guy or the largest
amount that this guy thinks

00:02:16.456 --> 00:02:18.855
that the Futures price might move by,

00:02:18.855 --> 00:02:21.866
the contract price might
move by any given day

00:02:21.866 --> 00:02:23.341
and so, he has a cushion.

00:02:23.341 --> 00:02:26.854
He can actually use the
margin as kind of insurance

00:02:26.854 --> 00:02:29.410
so he can make sure that
on the settlement date,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:30.132
both parties

00:02:30.762 --> 00:02:33.008
will kind of be able to

00:02:33.593 --> 00:02:35.218
meet their obligations.

00:02:35.218 --> 00:02:36.989
I'll go into more detail
with that on the next video

00:02:36.989 --> 23:59:59.999
on exactly how margin works.
