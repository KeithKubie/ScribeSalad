00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:04.790
You’re probably too young to remember, but
at one point, almost all the Earth’s landmass

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:09.110
was clumped into one gigantic supercontinent
called Pangea.

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:12.520
Land was like you and your friends from high
school: one tightly knit bunch.

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:17.280
But then you graduate, people move away, you
lose touch, and suddenly it’s 250 million

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.570
years later and the world’s all spread out
and everyone but you is getting married.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.359
Sorry, got lost in the metaphors.

00:00:24.359 --> 00:00:28.760
But the thing is, those forces that pulled
the Earth’s land in all directions are still

00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.910
here today, so what will the earth look like
in another 250 million years?

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.130
That is a very long way off so no one can
say for sure, but we can make educated guesses

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:40.080
based on what’s happening right now.

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:42.829
See the Earth’s surface isn’t set in stone.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.090
The crust and upper part of the molten mantle,
together called the lithosphere, are broken

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:51.280
up into several tectonic plates that fit together
like puzzle pieces.

00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:55.450
These plates glide around on the Earth’s
molten interior, creating mountains and volcanoes

00:00:55.450 --> 00:00:59.739
where they collide, new crust where they separate,
and earthquakes where they slide past each

00:00:59.739 --> 00:01:00.739
other.

00:01:00.739 --> 00:01:05.299
The plates only move centimeters each year,
but sometimes dramatic events happen suddenly.

00:01:05.299 --> 00:01:08.670
Like the giant crack that just opened up in
Africa.

00:01:08.670 --> 00:01:12.100
In March of 2018 a huge crack appeared in
Kenya.

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:16.310
There are a few possible explanations, like
heavy rain or underground water washing away

00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:17.310
sediment.

00:01:17.310 --> 00:01:20.060
But it’s also possible that Africa is splitting
in two.

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:24.569
The same forces that cause the plates to move
can also break them apart, and right now it

00:01:24.569 --> 00:01:29.590
looks like the African plate is breaking up
into unequal parts: the Somali and Nubian

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:30.799
plates.

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:35.119
Africa isn’t the only continent making a
break for it, Australia is on the move too.

00:01:35.119 --> 00:01:39.590
In fact the entire country is moving north
so quickly that it could throw GPS systems

00:01:39.590 --> 00:01:41.210
off in just a few years.

00:01:41.210 --> 00:01:45.700
If you take what we see happening now, you
can run the clock forward a bit and extrapolate

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.109
what is likely to happen.

00:01:47.109 --> 00:01:52.909
There’s no guarantees though, since things
move slow and steady right up until they don’t,

00:01:52.909 --> 00:01:55.909
and some unforeseen catastrophe changes everything.

00:01:55.909 --> 00:02:01.020
Anything past 50 million years in the future
is really speculative, but it’s fun, so

00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:02.090
let’s speculate!

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:06.109
Projections from Chris Scotese, a professor
from Northwestern University, have North and

00:02:06.109 --> 00:02:08.929
South America splitting up within the next
30 million years when Panama breaks away from

00:02:08.929 --> 00:02:09.929
Colombia.

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:13.469
This is of course due to man’s hubris when
we dug the Panama canal.

00:02:13.469 --> 00:02:18.180
Kidding, the same forces that slid Panama
into the place it is today will snap it off

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:20.620
of South America again sometime in the future.

00:02:20.620 --> 00:02:23.390
I guess Teddy Roosevelt could have just waited
a while

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:28.290
Down under will get a little less down and
under as Australia makes a bee line for Asia.

00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:31.989
According to Scotese’s estimates it will
smack into China, getting all up in it’s

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:35.290
business and fusing together within 65 million
years.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.430
Meanwhile the northern edge of Africa will
have joined up with the southern edge of Europe,

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:41.659
completely eliminating the mediterranean sea.

00:02:41.659 --> 00:02:45.269
So don’t buy beachfront property in Italy,
it’ll be worthless.

00:02:45.269 --> 00:02:49.410
Around 100 million years from now the Pacific
ocean will start getting bigger as the americas

00:02:49.410 --> 00:02:53.159
drift towards europe, but not before Alaska
nicks a piece of Russia.

00:02:53.159 --> 00:02:57.079
And while all this is happening Antarctica
will start drifting into the Indian ocean

00:02:57.079 --> 00:02:58.939
to see what the party’s all about.

00:02:58.939 --> 00:03:02.989
It will join Brazil and Madagascar at the
southern tip of Africa while Newfoundland

00:03:02.989 --> 00:03:04.970
smooshes into the Ivory Coast.

00:03:04.970 --> 00:03:10.650
In 250 million years, we could be looking
at a new supercontinent, Pangea Proxima.

00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:15.180
Of course this is one possibility, another
one is North America crosses the arctic ocean

00:03:15.180 --> 00:03:19.260
to snuggle up to Russia, forming another supercontinent
dubbed Amasia.

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:20.590
It’ll amaze-ya.

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:26.299
It’s kind of poetic that the whole gang
could get back together again.

00:03:26.299 --> 00:03:30.109
Of course, in all likelihood it’ll just
break up again and the cycle will continue

00:03:30.109 --> 00:03:34.409
until the earth’s molten interior cools
or something else causes tectonic activity

00:03:34.409 --> 00:03:35.469
to stop.

00:03:35.469 --> 00:03:38.939
But that’s way in the future, for now just
enjoy the ride.

00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:41.120
Especially you, Australia, hang on tight.

00:03:41.180 --> 00:03:45.660
Tectonic plates move between 2 and 7 centimeters
each year, which is about the same speed your

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:48.420
fingernails and hair grows, respectively.

00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:51.460
Thanks for tuning in, and come back for more videos from Seeker.
