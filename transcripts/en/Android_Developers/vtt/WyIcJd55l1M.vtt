[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:04.272 --> 00:00:05.480
ADAM CARPENTER: Hi everybody.

00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:07.960
My name's Adam Carpenter and
I lead the developer growth

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.180
consulting initiative
at Google Play.

00:00:10.180 --> 00:00:12.110
For anyone who's not
familiar with it,

00:00:12.110 --> 00:00:15.400
what growth consulting does
is take all the data and all

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:18.130
the insights that we have
here at Google, blends them

00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:21.130
with my own team's
expertise from industry,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.430
and we leverage that to
help identify opportunities

00:00:24.430 --> 00:00:27.130
in each of your games
and apps businesses.

00:00:27.130 --> 00:00:29.290
It's an incredibly
rewarding role

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:31.540
because it allows me to
provide a lot of guidance

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:34.540
and a lot of insights that
can help you identify what's

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:36.750
the lowest hanging fruit
in your businesses,

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:38.710
and where's the biggest
opportunity for growth

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:40.270
and improvement.

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:42.730
Additionally, I also work
closely with our product

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.830
and engineering
teams to both provide

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.690
guidance about what
kind of messaging

00:00:46.690 --> 00:00:49.360
we're sharing that resonates
best with developers,

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.520
as well as provides
a lot of feedback

00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:54.490
based on what developers
are telling us they need

00:00:54.490 --> 00:00:57.430
or would provide the
best business advantages.

00:00:57.430 --> 00:00:59.560
And today, I'm lucky
to be joined on stage

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:01.180
with three of our experts.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:04.060
Corina, who's one of the lead
engineers on our console team's

00:01:04.060 --> 00:01:08.170
benchmarking project, Fergus,
who's one of the primary PMs

00:01:08.170 --> 00:01:10.480
responsible for
benchmarking in vitals,

00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:13.230
and Tom who's been instrumental
with our core metrics

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:15.160
opportunities.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:18.100
Over the next 30 minutes or so,
I'm going to talk about some

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:20.440
of the frameworks that I'd
like to leverage when I think

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.840
about business growth and
understanding game and app

00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:26.388
performance, and
additionally, my colleagues

00:01:26.388 --> 00:01:28.180
are going to share some
of the new features

00:01:28.180 --> 00:01:30.640
in tooling that we
implement in the console

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:33.350
that you'll be able to leverage
to understand how your game

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:36.510
or app is performing,
understand what good looks like,

00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:39.010
and understand where you could
potentially optimize and grow

00:01:39.010 --> 00:01:40.612
your businesses.

00:01:40.612 --> 00:01:42.070
All of us are very,
very passionate

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:44.028
about business growth,
and it's really exciting

00:01:44.028 --> 00:01:46.420
to be here today.

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:48.850
When I think about
ecosystems, it's

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:52.540
an exceptionally broad concept,
because at the highest level,

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:55.720
you have this concept of games,
you have this concept of apps,

00:01:55.720 --> 00:01:57.580
and they're so vastly different.

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.530
And even when you begin to look
at what apps are themselves,

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:02.320
we have a whole
host of categories,

00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:04.760
we have genres
within categories.

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:07.530
And if you think about apps
like New York Times, Snap,

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.230
[INAUDIBLE],, Waze,
CNN, each of them

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:14.110
is fundamentally different
in terms of how they operate.

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:17.560
The value that they provide
to users, the types of metrics

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:19.900
that they look at, and
potentially even the north

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:22.120
stars that they aim for.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.010
But despite all of
those differences,

00:02:24.010 --> 00:02:26.770
there are commonalities
across all of them.

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.050
The low level,
fundamental metrics

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:32.590
that each app looks at,
that's a commonality that we

00:02:32.590 --> 00:02:33.910
can actually understand.

00:02:33.910 --> 00:02:36.070
We can see here at
Google, and therefore it

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.200
enables us to actually
build tooling around

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.230
that to provide better
opportunity identification

00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.600
and guidance to your
fellow developers,

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:45.790
so that you're better
equipped to understand

00:02:45.790 --> 00:02:48.400
how you're performing.

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.570
And so whenever I think
about business growth,

00:02:50.570 --> 00:02:52.870
especially when I'm working
with a new developer,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.290
I always like to construct
a hierarchical model, which

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.390
looks at what does
the developers top

00:02:58.390 --> 00:03:00.940
level goal, and what
are all the KPIs,

00:03:00.940 --> 00:03:03.307
or all the metrics
that feed up into it?

00:03:03.307 --> 00:03:05.140
It's a little bit of
an engineering mindset,

00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.110
and for me, it comes from
being a chemical engineer.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:09.640
The way I think
about engineering,

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:12.010
it's, take a problem,
break it down

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:15.130
into all of its core components,
understand how all of them

00:03:15.130 --> 00:03:18.170
work, understand how
all of them interrelate

00:03:18.170 --> 00:03:19.760
and, by gaining
that understanding,

00:03:19.760 --> 00:03:22.500
you can build it back
up to a full solution.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:26.770
And so the key opportunity
to optimize your business,

00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:29.380
no matter how complex
it is, is understanding

00:03:29.380 --> 00:03:33.650
how all of these components and
all these facets fit together.

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.650
And so in terms
of consultations,

00:03:35.650 --> 00:03:37.240
being able to look
at this allows

00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:39.160
me to better
understand the business

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.310
and be able to support its
growth and continued success

00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:43.750
over time.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:46.612
And to give you a
concrete example of this,

00:03:46.612 --> 00:03:48.820
I'll talk about something
that I think is universally

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:50.710
applicable to
everybody in this room,

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.600
and it's thinking
about the audience

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.360
of your game or your app.

00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.380
And in the context of
this discussion, what

00:03:56.380 --> 00:03:58.840
I mean by audience, I'm
really talking about all

00:03:58.840 --> 00:04:02.200
of the Android users around the
entire globe who have your game

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.070
or your app installed.

00:04:04.070 --> 00:04:05.620
And if you think
about that audience,

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:08.510
you can start to break it apart
into two different sections.

00:04:08.510 --> 00:04:10.630
The first being
your active users.

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.400
Whether your most
meaningful unit of time

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.220
is daily, weekly,
or monthly, who

00:04:15.220 --> 00:04:18.140
are those users that are
coming back at that frequency?

00:04:18.140 --> 00:04:19.990
And on the opposite
side, then you

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:22.420
have all of those users who've
churned out of your app.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.430
They haven't been active
in the recent past,

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:26.920
but they do still have it
installed on their device,

00:04:26.920 --> 00:04:30.400
so they do make up
your audience portion.

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:33.100
And then each of these, you
can decompose even further.

00:04:33.100 --> 00:04:34.918
Your active users,
this is largely

00:04:34.918 --> 00:04:37.210
the new users who are coming
into your app or your game

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.710
for the very first time each
day, or the returning users,

00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:42.310
your regular users
who are coming back

00:04:42.310 --> 00:04:43.702
on a frequent basis.

00:04:43.702 --> 00:04:45.160
And on the flip
side, when we think

00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:47.740
about those churned users,
it's really important

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:51.670
to understand what's potentially
driving them out of the game.

00:04:51.670 --> 00:04:53.790
What kind of technical
performance issues

00:04:53.790 --> 00:04:56.260
are maybe causing a
poor user experience,

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:59.470
causing them to leave the app?

00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:01.780
What our team has been
doing is working really

00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:04.560
hard to uncover a lot
of these insights,

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.140
expose them into the
console to enable you all

00:05:07.140 --> 00:05:09.110
to make better
business decisions,

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:11.820
and to tell us a lot more about
what we're actually building,

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:14.040
and what you'll be
able to get access to.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:16.007
I'd like to welcome Tom to talk.

00:05:16.007 --> 00:05:17.090
TOM GRINSTED: Thanks Adam.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:21.975
[APPLAUSE]

00:05:21.975 --> 00:05:23.330
Good afternoon, everyone.

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:25.450
As said, my name is Tom,
I'm a product manager.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:27.850
I specialize in core
metrics, so these

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.570
are really, really fundamental,
foundational metrics

00:05:31.570 --> 00:05:33.310
of your app and game businesses.

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:35.710
These are things like
installs and uninstalls, user

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:37.780
acquisition, and user churn.

00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:41.840
Now Adam, I just love
how your brain works.

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.150
I love this kind of model.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:44.650
I used to be an app
developer and we

00:05:44.650 --> 00:05:46.570
used to use these to
really understand how we

00:05:46.570 --> 00:05:48.340
could optimize our businesses.

00:05:48.340 --> 00:05:52.060
But any model like this is
only as useful as the data

00:05:52.060 --> 00:05:55.000
that you plug into it, because
it's a great way of thinking,

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.960
but to make it work for you,
you need fantastic metrics.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.990
Now when I look at this, I can
already see parts of the model

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:04.660
that frankly, the Play
Console right now is not

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.880
great at giving you data for.

00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.070
Returning users, for instance.

00:06:09.070 --> 00:06:12.240
Today, you can't get returning
user data in the console,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:13.670
and that's a problem.

00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.930
It's a problem because the app
ecosystem has evolved and moved

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:17.770
on.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:21.040
When we look at global data,
we see that, on average,

00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.610
between 20% and
25% of all installs

00:06:24.610 --> 00:06:26.650
are returning installers.

00:06:26.650 --> 00:06:28.870
These are people who have
installed you before,

00:06:28.870 --> 00:06:32.230
uninstalled, and decided
to give you a second go.

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:33.410
That's an average as well.

00:06:33.410 --> 00:06:34.990
So for some of you,
that percentage

00:06:34.990 --> 00:06:37.090
is going to be
much, much higher.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.580
If you want to understand
your active users

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:41.080
and how you acquire
users, you need

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.740
to understand these
kind of metrics.

00:06:43.740 --> 00:06:46.860
That's why teams in London have
been working for the last two

00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:50.130
years to redefine and
completely redevelop

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.940
some of our base metrics.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:54.540
And we've been doing it
so we can get all of you

00:06:54.540 --> 00:06:57.580
the information you need
to make better decisions.

00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.450
I want to explain how
we've approached it.

00:07:00.450 --> 00:07:04.560
Deep down, we aim to make our
new metrics understandable,

00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:08.260
predictable, more
granular, and more useful.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.950
And they all start
with one of two things.

00:07:10.950 --> 00:07:14.070
Do you really want to
measure users, people,

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:18.000
and by users at the moment we
mean signed in Google users

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:20.550
to Play, so one of
the most useful system

00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:22.170
identifiers on the web.

00:07:22.170 --> 00:07:25.740
Or are you looking for
devices, like Android IDs?

00:07:25.740 --> 00:07:27.570
That's the beginning
of our new metrics,

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:30.990
but it's nowhere near the end,
because the next thing we want

00:07:30.990 --> 00:07:33.030
to enable you to do
is to decide if you

00:07:33.030 --> 00:07:34.980
want to find out
if you've acquired

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.080
or lost a user or device.

00:07:37.080 --> 00:07:40.100
Have they installed you or
have they uninstalled you?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.762
But then after that we want
to give you more information.

00:07:42.762 --> 00:07:44.220
So with our new
metrics set, you'll

00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.970
be able to choose
whether you're measuring

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:51.070
literally every person, only new
users, or only returning users.

00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.630
You'll also be able to decide
what you're actually counting.

00:07:54.630 --> 00:07:57.210
Are you counting
uniques, individual users

00:07:57.210 --> 00:07:58.980
and individual devices?

00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:01.650
Or are you counting events,
every time something

00:08:01.650 --> 00:08:04.890
happens, so every time a
device is acquired or not?

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.110
Or are you counting
actives, who actually

00:08:07.110 --> 00:08:09.670
has you installed right now?

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:11.700
And then lastly,
we want to make it

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.100
much easier, especially
for the business decision

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:17.520
makers amongst you, to be able
to aggregate this data in ways

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:19.553
that match your
business cadence.

00:08:19.553 --> 00:08:20.970
So our new metrics
are going to be

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:23.460
available from
hourly up to calendar

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:25.290
quarterly granularities.

00:08:25.290 --> 00:08:27.210
And if you're selecting
uniques, we're

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:30.310
going to deed you over
those times as well.

00:08:30.310 --> 00:08:32.429
This is giving you
a level of insight

00:08:32.429 --> 00:08:34.770
into what people are doing,
how they're acquiring you,

00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:37.437
and if they're churning out that
we've not been able to give you

00:08:37.437 --> 00:08:39.630
before, but one that you
absolutely need and we

00:08:39.630 --> 00:08:42.150
understand that.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:44.760
All of these are going to be
available across the dimensions

00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:47.850
that we already provide,
so by device, by country,

00:08:47.850 --> 00:08:50.860
by app version, and also by
a couple of new ones as well.

00:08:50.860 --> 00:08:53.760
My favorite is install method,
because Play can report

00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:56.023
on things that
sometimes others can't.

00:08:56.023 --> 00:08:58.440
So we're going to start telling
you which of your installs

00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.670
are pre-installed,
organically came through Play,

00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:05.950
were via peer to peer, or other
acquisition methods as well.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.730
So, if you imagine that one
day your VP comes up to you

00:09:08.730 --> 00:09:12.840
and she asks how many times you
uninstalled on a specific day,

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.640
you can easily
answer that question

00:09:14.640 --> 00:09:16.350
by configuring your metrics.

00:09:16.350 --> 00:09:18.150
You can look at how
many devices you

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:21.310
lost on a day, and
your major events.

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:23.520
But similarly, let us
imagine that she asked,

00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:25.810
how many users did you
win back last month?

00:09:25.810 --> 00:09:27.810
Something that we've never
been able to give you

00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:29.210
insight on before.

00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:31.410
Well with the new metric
sets you can predictably

00:09:31.410 --> 00:09:32.850
answer that as well.

00:09:32.850 --> 00:09:36.630
So you can select, well,
I'm interested in returning

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:39.820
users acquired, unique
for the last month.

00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:41.700
This is how simple
and how clear we want

00:09:41.700 --> 00:09:43.650
to make these complex metrics.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.050
And it's also worth
saying that all of these

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:50.560
subscribe to very stringent
user privacy as well.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:52.560
So we're doing this within
the bounds of Android

00:09:52.560 --> 00:09:55.320
strong privacy models.

00:09:55.320 --> 00:09:58.440
Now we've taken the way to
think about these metrics

00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:02.170
and we've instituted it
directly into the stats page.

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:04.860
This is one of the most powerful
metrics page on the console.

00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.740
So, just like today, you'll
be able to select up to two

00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:09.870
metrics that you can compare.

00:10:09.870 --> 00:10:11.940
But then, we
instituted the model

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.375
that I just spoke you through.

00:10:13.375 --> 00:10:15.750
So you'll be able to select
whether you're looking at new

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:18.407
or returning users or devices.

00:10:18.407 --> 00:10:20.240
You'll also be able to
choose whether you're

00:10:20.240 --> 00:10:24.143
measuring events or uniques.

00:10:24.143 --> 00:10:26.310
Similarly, you'll be able
to choose the granularity,

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:30.810
[INAUDIBLE] over, and you'll
be able to apply new metrics

00:10:30.810 --> 00:10:32.640
calculations.

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:35.760
You'll be able to look at
just the parental data,

00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:38.240
the cumulative data from
the beginning of time,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:40.290
or 30 day rolling averages
to really help you

00:10:40.290 --> 00:10:43.140
remove noise and spot trends.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.150
Now these metrics
can be complex.

00:10:45.150 --> 00:10:47.040
We hope they're
really, really helpful,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.260
but after you found the
one that you really want,

00:10:49.260 --> 00:10:51.052
and one that you want
to come back to again

00:10:51.052 --> 00:10:52.950
and again and again,
we want to make it easy

00:10:52.950 --> 00:10:54.700
for you to use that.

00:10:54.700 --> 00:10:57.810
So the stats page is also going
to have suggestive reports,

00:10:57.810 --> 00:11:00.060
and saved reports as well.

00:11:00.060 --> 00:11:02.375
These allow you to
quickly jump to the things

00:11:02.375 --> 00:11:03.750
that you're looking
for, and even

00:11:03.750 --> 00:11:06.030
name them in a way
that's sensible to you.

00:11:06.030 --> 00:11:09.085
As you can see, I quite
like using my emojis.

00:11:09.085 --> 00:11:11.460
Now, we've been working on
this for ages, and all of them

00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.630
are going to be launched over
the next couple of months.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:16.730
ADAM CARPENTER: So this
type of data can really

00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:20.020
or power the type of insights
that I was talking about.

00:11:20.020 --> 00:11:22.980
And a lot of the developers
we've been testing it with

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:25.490
have been really excited
about what it's enabled.

00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:27.210
And like Francesco
from [INAUDIBLE]

00:11:27.210 --> 00:11:31.650
it's really amazing to see how
developers can take advantage

00:11:31.650 --> 00:11:33.090
of the types of
information we're

00:11:33.090 --> 00:11:35.730
able to present in the console.

00:11:35.730 --> 00:11:37.470
But it's one of these
things that like--

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.930
more data is good,
but data by itself

00:11:39.930 --> 00:11:42.000
isn't necessarily as meaningful.

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.690
What developers really need as
business leaders and decision

00:11:44.690 --> 00:11:47.990
makers is data in context,
which is really information,

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:51.560
because information can
actually empower leaders to make

00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.630
meaningful business
decisions that will actually

00:11:53.630 --> 00:11:55.392
result in a positive impact.

00:11:55.392 --> 00:11:57.350
TOM GRINSTED: Right, no,
I completely get that.

00:11:57.350 --> 00:11:59.350
The data is the beginning
of your understanding,

00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:00.440
but it's not the end.

00:12:00.440 --> 00:12:01.815
One of the things
that we've done

00:12:01.815 --> 00:12:05.000
is talk to a lot of developers
about common modes of analysis

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.010
that you also do with
Play data, and we're

00:12:07.010 --> 00:12:09.020
baking some of those
analyses directly

00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.650
into the product as well.

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:12.950
So if we scroll down
the new statistics page,

00:12:12.950 --> 00:12:15.200
you can find my favorite
chart on the console

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:18.140
at the moment, the brand
new change analysis chart.

00:12:18.140 --> 00:12:20.360
What this does is
takes the dimension

00:12:20.360 --> 00:12:22.040
you've selected
for your metrics,

00:12:22.040 --> 00:12:25.120
the beginning of your period,
and the end of your period,

00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.840
and nets the difference.

00:12:26.840 --> 00:12:29.090
Basically, it's a
really quick, easy way

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.490
to see which were the biggest
movers over a period of time.

00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:34.700
So in this example,
which countries change

00:12:34.700 --> 00:12:36.815
most with my active users.

00:12:36.815 --> 00:12:38.690
It's a really quick,
simple way to understand

00:12:38.690 --> 00:12:40.608
what the data is
trying to tell you,

00:12:40.608 --> 00:12:42.650
and what the data tells
you is really telling you

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:44.900
what Android users are
trying to tell you,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:48.475
which is how they acquire and
how they churn out of your app.

00:12:48.475 --> 00:12:49.850
ADAM CARPENTER:
And this is great

00:12:49.850 --> 00:12:52.017
because this is something
that you all, if inclined,

00:12:52.017 --> 00:12:54.050
could work into the type
of hierarchical model

00:12:54.050 --> 00:12:55.860
that I was discussing before.

00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:57.680
And it's important to
actually really see,

00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:00.650
how can you leverage the value
that Google provides to better

00:13:00.650 --> 00:13:02.020
understand your business?

00:13:02.020 --> 00:13:04.850
But to be a bit blunt,
Tom, it's one thing

00:13:04.850 --> 00:13:07.670
to see your own performance,
but this is only half the story

00:13:07.670 --> 00:13:10.280
because, while developers can
benchmark against themselves

00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:12.260
and try to guess at
how you're doing,

00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:14.000
maybe relative to your
own mallet tricks,

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:15.470
maybe relative one
of your other apps,

00:13:15.470 --> 00:13:17.928
it would be much more powerful
if developers could actually

00:13:17.928 --> 00:13:20.200
see how they compared
against their top peers.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:21.992
TOM GRINSTED: Right,
I completely get that,

00:13:21.992 --> 00:13:24.350
and thanks for being blunt.

00:13:24.350 --> 00:13:26.460
Your data is always
useful to you.

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:29.420
But context is even more
useful, because context

00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:31.760
helps you understand
what your data looks

00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.500
like compared to a
much, much broader

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.430
ecosystem of information.

00:13:35.430 --> 00:13:38.030
Now this leads us on
to what I think is

00:13:38.030 --> 00:13:40.318
an amazing, fantastic product.

00:13:40.318 --> 00:13:42.110
I could talk about it
for ages, but I'm not

00:13:42.110 --> 00:13:44.390
the best person to do
so, because Corina here

00:13:44.390 --> 00:13:45.950
has been leading
our teams working

00:13:45.950 --> 00:13:47.520
on ecosystem benchmarks.

00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:49.990
So I'd like to hand over to
her to tell you all about it.

00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:54.800
[APPLAUSE]

00:13:54.800 --> 00:13:56.060
CORINA GRIGORAS: Thanks Tom.

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:57.120
Hi everyone.

00:13:57.120 --> 00:14:00.230
I'm Corina and I'm an
engineer on the Play Console.

00:14:00.230 --> 00:14:02.780
So I'll tell you about
some of the great insights

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.460
you can get from benchmarks.

00:14:05.460 --> 00:14:08.360
Now, as Adam and Tom
mentioned, imagine

00:14:08.360 --> 00:14:11.030
you're trying to assess
how your app is doing.

00:14:11.030 --> 00:14:13.850
So go into Play Console,
and you look, for instance,

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:17.360
at your user acquisition
and your user loss.

00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:21.410
If this is what you see, what
do these graphs tell you?

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:24.210
Well, your user
acquisition is going up,

00:14:24.210 --> 00:14:25.340
so that's good, right?

00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:27.350
That means you're doing well.

00:14:27.350 --> 00:14:29.970
But your user loss
is also going up.

00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:31.470
So what does that mean?

00:14:31.470 --> 00:14:33.620
Maybe that's not so good,
because you'd ideally

00:14:33.620 --> 00:14:36.980
want to retain users
and not lose them.

00:14:36.980 --> 00:14:40.250
This is where benchmarks can
be very useful, because they

00:14:40.250 --> 00:14:42.800
can add context to
these numbers and help

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:45.350
you evaluate these trends.

00:14:45.350 --> 00:14:47.360
Now let's look at
your performance

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:50.780
if we compare it
next to a benchmark.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:53.930
In this case, you can see that
your acquisition is not only

00:14:53.930 --> 00:14:56.930
doing well, it's actually
doing really well,

00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.180
because your acquisition
is going upwards,

00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:02.150
even though the benchmark
is going downwards.

00:15:02.150 --> 00:15:04.820
This means you're doing
much better in this area.

00:15:04.820 --> 00:15:07.460
So it's a good reason for
you to celebrate and probably

00:15:07.460 --> 00:15:10.910
not invest or focus too much.

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:14.750
And for user loss, you also
see a positive sign this time,

00:15:14.750 --> 00:15:17.160
because even though
it is going upwards,

00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:20.880
It's doing so at a slower
rate than the benchmark.

00:15:20.880 --> 00:15:23.150
And this is where I find
that benchmarks can give you

00:15:23.150 --> 00:15:25.370
really interesting insights.

00:15:25.370 --> 00:15:27.620
What this probably
means is that there

00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:30.800
is limited opportunity in
the market in this area,

00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:32.600
because the trend
that you see, it's

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:34.440
common to the wider market.

00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.090
And it's not something
that is specific to Europe.

00:15:38.090 --> 00:15:40.180
So in this example,
you can see how

00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:43.090
benchmarks help you get an
overall positive picture

00:15:43.090 --> 00:15:45.590
of your performance.

00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:48.070
But now, imagine that
your performance is still

00:15:48.070 --> 00:15:50.740
exactly the same, and
the benchmark instead

00:15:50.740 --> 00:15:53.390
look like this.

00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.620
In this case, your
acquisition is going upwards,

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:59.870
but it's doing so at a slower
rate than the benchmark.

00:15:59.870 --> 00:16:03.310
Now the difference might
be pretty tiny today,

00:16:03.310 --> 00:16:07.170
but if this trend continues,
that difference will increase.

00:16:07.170 --> 00:16:09.490
So you probably want
to monitor this area

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:13.030
and start thinking about
how you can address it.

00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:16.960
And this time, your user loss
is actually not doing that well,

00:16:16.960 --> 00:16:19.540
because your user
loss is going upwards,

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:23.170
but the benchmark is going
downwards in this area.

00:16:23.170 --> 00:16:26.260
This shows that there's a
big opportunity here for you,

00:16:26.260 --> 00:16:29.110
and a lot of headroom
for improvement.

00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.120
And this is exactly what
benchmarks highlight

00:16:31.120 --> 00:16:35.320
in these examples, the areas
with opportunity in the market,

00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:37.910
and how large these
opportunities are.

00:16:37.910 --> 00:16:40.600
So it can hopefully help
you prioritize the things

00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.410
you want to focus on next.

00:16:43.410 --> 00:16:46.450
But there's one
challenge in benchmarks.

00:16:46.450 --> 00:16:49.900
Comparing absolute numbers
of acquisition and loss

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:54.350
might not always be the right
or the best thing to do.

00:16:54.350 --> 00:16:56.690
To address this
issue, we're also

00:16:56.690 --> 00:16:59.750
working on calculating
change rates.

00:16:59.750 --> 00:17:01.430
Change rates are
relative differences

00:17:01.430 --> 00:17:04.950
of a metric from one
period to the next.

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:08.690
We will calculate this on all
of the metric configurations

00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:11.250
that Tom mentioned earlier.

00:17:11.250 --> 00:17:14.990
And we will also add benchmarks
to all of these change rates.

00:17:14.990 --> 00:17:17.569
And hopefully, with
all these additions,

00:17:17.569 --> 00:17:20.750
we'll be able to give you better
context on how your app grows

00:17:20.750 --> 00:17:24.020
over time, but also a
meaningful comparison that you

00:17:24.020 --> 00:17:27.550
can use to assess that growth.

00:17:27.550 --> 00:17:29.340
So when all this is
available, here's

00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:32.220
an example of the kind
of insight and analysis

00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:35.490
you'll be able to get
from the Play Console.

00:17:35.490 --> 00:17:38.370
For instance, you'll be able
to compare how quickly you're

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:41.490
acquiring users, or
you'll be able to check

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:44.280
if your uninstall rates
are abnormally high,

00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.460
or even compare how your
growth performs versus

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.650
the benchmark in
specific countries

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:50.817
or in some specific devices.

00:17:50.817 --> 00:17:52.733
ADAM CARPENTER: So
benchmarks are really cool,

00:17:52.733 --> 00:17:54.990
but they're only as valuable
as a set of peers you

00:17:54.990 --> 00:17:56.690
have to compare yourself with.

00:17:56.690 --> 00:17:58.650
It's a little bit like
garbage in, garbage out.

00:17:58.650 --> 00:18:00.420
What are we doing
to give developers

00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:01.483
more actionable insights?

00:18:01.483 --> 00:18:03.400
CORINA GRIGORAS: I think
that's a great point,

00:18:03.400 --> 00:18:05.760
and that's where I personally
find benchmarks really

00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.340
exciting, because
what we have done

00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:11.010
is used all the understanding
and the metadata

00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.580
that Play has about the apps
and games that we published,

00:18:14.580 --> 00:18:16.710
and with all of this,
we have automatically

00:18:16.710 --> 00:18:19.590
generated curated peer sets.

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:21.390
These are essentially
sets of apps

00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:23.610
that have very
similar functionality,

00:18:23.610 --> 00:18:25.140
and you can use
one of these sets

00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:28.140
to compare your
performance against.

00:18:28.140 --> 00:18:30.450
And we even recommend
the set that we

00:18:30.450 --> 00:18:32.820
think are most suitable
for your app or game

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:35.030
to be compared with.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:37.740
We will compute benchmarks
for all of these peer sets,

00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:40.770
and we will do so with very
strong privacy protection

00:18:40.770 --> 00:18:44.760
so no individual app
or game metrics will

00:18:44.760 --> 00:18:47.460
be able to be reverse engineered
from the benchmark value

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:49.740
that we show in the console.

00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:53.970
And we'll have a total of over
150 peer sets, and these range

00:18:53.970 --> 00:18:57.570
very much, from racing
games to wallpaper apps,

00:18:57.570 --> 00:19:00.240
or from social apps
to streaming media.

00:19:00.240 --> 00:19:02.700
So you'll be able to
compare your growth

00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:06.060
to a benchmark performance
computed on a very wide range

00:19:06.060 --> 00:19:08.565
of these curated peer sets.

00:19:08.565 --> 00:19:10.440
ADAM CARPENTER: And so
this is kind of great,

00:19:10.440 --> 00:19:12.398
and what we found is that
the developers who've

00:19:12.398 --> 00:19:14.790
been able to access this
early on or get hints

00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:17.460
about and provide feedback
are already seeing ways

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.950
that they can use this
to power decision making,

00:19:19.950 --> 00:19:22.290
to be able to run
better experiments,

00:19:22.290 --> 00:19:25.505
and it feels like, as valuable
as this is what you're talking

00:19:25.505 --> 00:19:26.880
about, it'd also
be really useful

00:19:26.880 --> 00:19:30.528
if we were to integrate it
back into some of the reporting

00:19:30.528 --> 00:19:32.070
that we already
have, the acquisition

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:34.300
report we launched last year.

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:36.390
CORINA GRIGORAS: Yeah,
that's an excellent point,

00:19:36.390 --> 00:19:38.460
and that's exactly
what we intend to do.

00:19:38.460 --> 00:19:41.190
We intend to bring curated
peer sets to the acquisition

00:19:41.190 --> 00:19:42.480
reports.

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.250
Now, what acquisition
reports show

00:19:44.250 --> 00:19:47.010
you today is a
benchmark that's only

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:50.320
computed on a peer set that
represents the same place

00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:53.443
or category as your app or game.

00:19:53.443 --> 00:19:55.860
And this is good when you're
looking for that broad market

00:19:55.860 --> 00:19:59.340
comparison, but it might be a
bit limiting if you're looking

00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.980
for a more specific comparison.

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:05.060
One example that we
hear a lot from you devs

00:20:05.060 --> 00:20:07.910
is around the maps and
navigation category.

00:20:07.910 --> 00:20:11.460
This navigation contains
navigation apps, taxi and ride

00:20:11.460 --> 00:20:15.120
sharing apps, train timetable
apps, public transportation

00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.630
apps, and so on.

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:20.410
And as you can see, these
vary widely in functionality.

00:20:20.410 --> 00:20:22.620
Now if you're in this
category and are looking

00:20:22.620 --> 00:20:24.900
to compare with
your competitors,

00:20:24.900 --> 00:20:29.130
you probably want to dig a bit
deeper than the category level.

00:20:29.130 --> 00:20:31.400
With curated peer
sets, we have created

00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:34.020
a hierarchical structure,
so they will easily

00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:36.930
allow you to switch between
the broad market comparison

00:20:36.930 --> 00:20:39.540
and the more specific one.

00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:42.600
And what's even more exciting
is, whenever it's possible,

00:20:42.600 --> 00:20:45.277
we're going to let you narrow
this down even further.

00:20:45.277 --> 00:20:46.860
But Fergus is going
to be talking more

00:20:46.860 --> 00:20:48.450
about this in a few minutes.

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:50.158
ADAM CARPENTER: This
is really very cool.

00:20:50.158 --> 00:20:52.075
When can the developers
get their hands on it?

00:20:52.075 --> 00:20:53.866
CORINA GRIGORAS: All
this will be available

00:20:53.866 --> 00:20:55.982
soon in the console, in
the next month or two.

00:20:55.982 --> 00:20:57.440
So stay tuned for
our announcement.

00:20:57.440 --> 00:21:03.580
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:04.830
ADAM CARPENTER: Thanks Corina.

00:21:04.830 --> 00:21:07.207
These are insights that
are really, really powerful

00:21:07.207 --> 00:21:09.540
and something I'm really
excited to see being pushed out

00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:11.880
into the console because,
while my team does

00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.220
work that I really,
really enjoy, there's only

00:21:14.220 --> 00:21:15.750
a small number of
us, and everything

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.042
we can do in the console,
it's available and accessible

00:21:18.042 --> 00:21:20.310
to everybody in this
room and every developer

00:21:20.310 --> 00:21:21.640
around the world.

00:21:21.640 --> 00:21:23.880
And I really love how
all of these insights,

00:21:23.880 --> 00:21:25.410
especially once
you can benchmark

00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:27.390
your app against
the basket of peers,

00:21:27.390 --> 00:21:29.760
it's going to really
contextualize your performance

00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.670
and seriously help you
understand what good actually

00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:33.650
looks like.

00:21:33.650 --> 00:21:35.263
And what I'm hoping
is that you guys

00:21:35.263 --> 00:21:36.930
are going to be able
to get to the point

00:21:36.930 --> 00:21:40.140
where you can develop really
actionable insights based

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:42.900
on what you're able to see,
and really be much more

00:21:42.900 --> 00:21:45.480
informed about what
good looks like

00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:47.830
and what your performance is.

00:21:47.830 --> 00:21:49.980
And so, if you think back
about this mall that I'm

00:21:49.980 --> 00:21:52.680
talking about, the addressable
audience, and the data that Tom

00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.720
was talking about,
it should really

00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:58.410
help you actually understand
user acquisition, user loss,

00:21:58.410 --> 00:22:01.633
who's active on any given
day, who's actually returning.

00:22:01.633 --> 00:22:03.300
And one of the neat
things is that these

00:22:03.300 --> 00:22:05.550
are all free benefits you
get from publishing on Play.

00:22:05.550 --> 00:22:07.530
And it's one of those
things that is exciting

00:22:07.530 --> 00:22:09.572
to me, working at Google,
is that we can actually

00:22:09.572 --> 00:22:10.922
expose a lot of this to you.

00:22:10.922 --> 00:22:13.380
But if you think about this
model that we're talking about,

00:22:13.380 --> 00:22:16.440
primarily we've been focusing
on that left side of the tree,

00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:18.665
and the right side
is equally important,

00:22:18.665 --> 00:22:20.040
in some ways even
more important,

00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:23.930
because negative performance,
poor user experiences,

00:22:23.930 --> 00:22:26.112
all of these can drive
users out of the game.

00:22:26.112 --> 00:22:27.570
And if you're an
app or a game that

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:29.070
does paid user
acquisition, you've

00:22:29.070 --> 00:22:30.987
already spent a lot of
money to get the mints.

00:22:30.987 --> 00:22:33.580
The last thing you want to
do is actually lose them.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:36.160
And so, I think to understand
a lot of that side of the tree,

00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:38.580
you're going to want much
more control about who

00:22:38.580 --> 00:22:40.838
your competitors are,
who's in the peer set,

00:22:40.838 --> 00:22:42.630
and I need to get Fergus
to talk about some

00:22:42.630 --> 00:22:44.430
of the really neat things we're
doing to give you a much more

00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.950
intelligent view of your
vitals, and how you're

00:22:46.950 --> 00:22:48.601
comparing to competitors.

00:22:51.133 --> 00:22:53.050
FERGUS HURLEY: Well Adam,
as the app ecosystem

00:22:53.050 --> 00:22:54.730
has become more and
more competitive,

00:22:54.730 --> 00:22:57.370
your app's technical performance
has actually become one

00:22:57.370 --> 00:22:59.880
of its most important features.

00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:01.710
When we look at the
Google Play reviews,

00:23:01.710 --> 00:23:04.320
we can see that app
tech on performance

00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:06.990
has a direct impact
on your ratings.

00:23:06.990 --> 00:23:09.720
Here you can see that
42% of the reviews

00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:14.170
are talking about bugs
and stability alone.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.830
And that's why we built Android
vitals into the Play Console.

00:23:17.830 --> 00:23:21.580
Android Vitals provides you
over 10 engineering performance

00:23:21.580 --> 00:23:23.770
metrics, so you can
be able to understand

00:23:23.770 --> 00:23:28.420
how your app is performing
across five performance areas.

00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.872
Now, I was the founding product
manager of Android vitals,

00:23:30.872 --> 00:23:32.830
and as part of that, I
worked with many experts

00:23:32.830 --> 00:23:35.963
across Google to invent
these new metrics.

00:23:35.963 --> 00:23:37.630
One of the things we
struggled with when

00:23:37.630 --> 00:23:40.090
we gave these metrics to
our early access partners

00:23:40.090 --> 00:23:41.800
for that program
was that they didn't

00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.350
know whether this
metric was good or bad,

00:23:44.350 --> 00:23:46.990
and that's why, when we first
launched Android vitals two

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:51.200
years ago, we introduced it with
the concept of bad behaviors.

00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.640
This is where we flagged
the bottom 25% of apps

00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.300
as having a bad behavior.

00:23:56.300 --> 00:24:00.510
So you knew if you had to
improve your performance.

00:24:00.510 --> 00:24:03.480
Last year, at Google I/O,
we went one step further

00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:05.680
and we introduced
category benchmarks,

00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:08.310
so you were able to understand
what percentage of apps

00:24:08.310 --> 00:24:10.920
in every category
you were better than,

00:24:10.920 --> 00:24:12.360
and so you could
be able to invest

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:18.210
your resources in the areas that
you needed to improve the most.

00:24:18.210 --> 00:24:19.710
App categories are
pretty important,

00:24:19.710 --> 00:24:22.433
and there are major differences
between app categories,

00:24:22.433 --> 00:24:24.600
as you can see here as an
example of slow cold start

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:26.240
times.

00:24:26.240 --> 00:24:28.850
However, as Corina
mentioned, app categories

00:24:28.850 --> 00:24:30.860
are oftentimes too
broad, and that's

00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:36.060
why we're really excited
to have curated peer sets.

00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.580
Now, we want to go
one step further.

00:24:38.580 --> 00:24:40.710
Hands up here, who
has ever wanted

00:24:40.710 --> 00:24:43.080
to be able to compare
their technical performance

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:46.270
with their direct competitors?

00:24:46.270 --> 00:24:48.910
OK, good stuff, that's very
much everyone for everyone

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.820
who's on the videos.

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:55.660
We're extremely excited, and I
am personally extremely proud,

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:58.330
to be able to announce
today, developer

00:24:58.330 --> 00:25:00.830
selected peer benchmarks.

00:25:00.830 --> 00:25:03.700
This enables you to be able to
select your direct competitors

00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.440
that you want to be able to
compare your performance with.

00:25:06.440 --> 00:25:10.810
And when you do that, you
can be able to then see

00:25:10.810 --> 00:25:14.290
the peer median for that metric
that you're looking at it would

00:25:14.290 --> 00:25:16.900
in vitals, and what is
the difference between you

00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.920
and that peer median.

00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:24.470
Now the initial peer set
is recommended for you.

00:25:24.470 --> 00:25:26.200
And this is based
on many signals.

00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:28.420
One is the Play
Store similar apps

00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.670
that you see on your
Play Store listing,

00:25:30.670 --> 00:25:32.680
but you can go in and
edit the peer set.

00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.170
We have a list of other
recommended apps for your peer

00:25:35.170 --> 00:25:36.050
set.

00:25:36.050 --> 00:25:38.470
You can also be able
to search for an app

00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:42.510
by name, keyword, or
even the package name,

00:25:42.510 --> 00:25:44.610
and then you can be able
to create the peer set.

00:25:44.610 --> 00:25:46.470
Now, for vitals, there
are some restrictions

00:25:46.470 --> 00:25:49.490
to how you create the peer set.

00:25:49.490 --> 00:25:54.450
You have to have between 8
and 12 apps in the peer set.

00:25:54.450 --> 00:25:57.060
Second is, you can only make
three changes per month,

00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.010
but this still enables you to
be able to update your peer

00:25:59.010 --> 00:26:00.802
set often enough where
there are new market

00:26:00.802 --> 00:26:04.440
entrants, and previous
competitors, you can remove,

00:26:04.440 --> 00:26:07.480
that you can see as
no longer competitors.

00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:12.100
You can also only select one
app from any other developer

00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:14.830
account, and no apps from
your own developer account.

00:26:18.357 --> 00:26:19.940
We've been extremely
thoughtful in how

00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.190
we've designed this
feature, because we value

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:25.580
your privacy and your data.

00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:29.170
If you really want, you can
opt out of this program.

00:26:29.170 --> 00:26:30.890
And if there's an
opt out functionality

00:26:30.890 --> 00:26:35.030
within the Preferences
section of the console.

00:26:35.030 --> 00:26:37.180
I would point out a
few things here though.

00:26:37.180 --> 00:26:40.750
One is that your vitals
data can be measured,

00:26:40.750 --> 00:26:42.490
oftentimes in a test lab.

00:26:42.490 --> 00:26:44.950
And the most advanced
developers who have the budget

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:46.420
already do that today.

00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:50.230
So we believe that this feature
creates more easy access

00:26:50.230 --> 00:26:53.620
for all developers to be able to
understand the core performance

00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.570
metrics that they
care about the most

00:26:55.570 --> 00:26:59.330
from that part of the
ecosystem that matters to them.

00:26:59.330 --> 00:27:03.580
Second is that your data is
combined with a set of at least

00:27:03.580 --> 00:27:06.190
seven other apps, and only
the median of that peer set

00:27:06.190 --> 00:27:08.850
is shown.

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.600
Finally, this feature is
only available to people

00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:16.390
who have vital data and are
above the privacy threshold.

00:27:16.390 --> 00:27:18.880
This feature is now
available, starting today,

00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.720
for the performance areas in
vitals of battery, rendering,

00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:25.540
startup time, and stability.

00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:30.970
And, for the newest area of
the vitals performance product,

00:27:30.970 --> 00:27:32.072
app size.

00:27:32.072 --> 00:27:33.780
If you want to learn
more about app size,

00:27:33.780 --> 00:27:35.488
there's a session
tomorrow just dedicated

00:27:35.488 --> 00:27:39.860
to that product at 8:30
AM tomorrow at stage two.

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:44.765
So, early risers, you
got your opportunity.

00:27:44.765 --> 00:27:46.640
We've had a few developers
using this product

00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:49.490
over the past couple of weeks,
and they've really enjoyed it.

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:52.430
And we have a quote here
from the game loft team,

00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:54.980
where they've been able to
prioritize their engineering

00:27:54.980 --> 00:27:58.060
advancements because
they're now able to select

00:27:58.060 --> 00:28:01.747
the specific apps that match
their particular requirements.

00:28:01.747 --> 00:28:04.080
ADAM CARPENTER: And this is
really cool because my role,

00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:06.038
I work with a lot of
[? FEXOs, ?] non-technical

00:28:06.038 --> 00:28:08.120
ones, chief marketing
officers, chief product

00:28:08.120 --> 00:28:09.590
officers, and a
lot of them don't

00:28:09.590 --> 00:28:11.180
have the background
or the experience

00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.013
to be able to understand
a lot of the really

00:28:13.013 --> 00:28:14.060
technical nuances.

00:28:14.060 --> 00:28:15.560
What I think is
really valuable here

00:28:15.560 --> 00:28:17.030
is that business
leaders are going

00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:18.655
to be able to leverage
this information

00:28:18.655 --> 00:28:21.140
to make very important form
decisions without needing

00:28:21.140 --> 00:28:22.170
to be an engineer.

00:28:22.170 --> 00:28:24.750
And so that's really, really
powerful and really exciting.

00:28:24.750 --> 00:28:26.750
But when I think about
public data like ratings,

00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:28.125
are we going to
do anything there

00:28:28.125 --> 00:28:29.745
to actually let
developers see it?

00:28:29.745 --> 00:28:31.870
FERGUS HURLEY: Adam, you
might have a future career

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.242
as a fortuneteller, because you
can predict the future here.

00:28:35.242 --> 00:28:38.440
That was meant as a joke.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.585
OK, so for vitals,
we have some rules.

00:28:42.585 --> 00:28:43.960
But for ratings,
because the data

00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.750
is public and available
to all users when

00:28:46.750 --> 00:28:50.260
they go to the Play Store, we
have very little restrictions

00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:50.980
here.

00:28:50.980 --> 00:28:55.240
You can be able to go in and
select between 1 and 12 apps

00:28:55.240 --> 00:28:58.120
and be able to see, for
each individual app, what

00:28:58.120 --> 00:29:01.760
their rating is, how that
compares with your rating,

00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:03.940
and how it compares to
the median of the peer set

00:29:03.940 --> 00:29:04.967
you create.

00:29:04.967 --> 00:29:07.300
And then you can be able to
update this peer set that as

00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:08.050
often as you want.

00:29:11.855 --> 00:29:14.230
As Corina mentioned, it's
really important to understand,

00:29:14.230 --> 00:29:16.870
when you're looking at
the trend of your data,

00:29:16.870 --> 00:29:19.640
how you're performing
relative to the benchmark.

00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:22.120
So for both vitals
and for ratings,

00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.450
we'll show you the peer set
median plotted over time,

00:29:25.450 --> 00:29:28.130
along with your data.

00:29:28.130 --> 00:29:29.840
For ratings, you'll
be able to switch

00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:32.360
between your daily rating
and your lifetime rating.

00:29:36.010 --> 00:29:37.630
Over the past couple
of years, we've

00:29:37.630 --> 00:29:39.723
received a lot of
feedback from developers

00:29:39.723 --> 00:29:41.140
that the Google
Play rating that's

00:29:41.140 --> 00:29:43.997
shown to users on
the store has issues.

00:29:43.997 --> 00:29:46.330
One of the primary ones is
that if you had a bad release

00:29:46.330 --> 00:29:49.150
a few years ago, you're still
suffering from that today,

00:29:49.150 --> 00:29:51.380
because it is based on
your lifetime rating.

00:29:51.380 --> 00:29:55.750
So we're really excited to make
available a new Google Play

00:29:55.750 --> 00:29:57.040
rating.

00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.010
This is shown to you today in
your rating section of the Play

00:30:00.010 --> 00:30:01.830
Console.

00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:04.560
However, it will not be
shown to users on the store

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:06.460
until August of this year.

00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:08.400
So you have plenty
of time to start

00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:11.150
working on improving your rating
and responding to your user

00:30:11.150 --> 00:30:13.650
reviews to try and improve your
rating between now and then.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:21.470
If you go to the ratings details
page for any of the breakdowns

00:30:21.470 --> 00:30:24.620
that we have across country,
language, Android version,

00:30:24.620 --> 00:30:28.070
et cetera, you can see
how your rating compares

00:30:28.070 --> 00:30:32.418
with each of the breakdowns
that are there across the peer

00:30:32.418 --> 00:30:33.960
set that you create,
and that you can

00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.140
update as often as you want.

00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:37.890
ADAM CARPENTER: So
this is really helpful,

00:30:37.890 --> 00:30:39.090
and I think it's
actually going to provide

00:30:39.090 --> 00:30:40.650
a lot of intelligence
to developers

00:30:40.650 --> 00:30:43.020
about even where to prioritize
user acquisition, which

00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:45.150
countries are strong,
which countries are not.

00:30:45.150 --> 00:30:47.868
What kind of guidance and advice
do you have for everybody here?

00:30:47.868 --> 00:30:50.160
FERGUS HURLEY: Yeah, so I
think the top piece of advice

00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.270
here is just to
use this feature.

00:30:52.270 --> 00:30:54.750
Oftentimes, a lot of
people within companies

00:30:54.750 --> 00:30:56.550
don't have access
to the Play Console.

00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:59.100
So I encourage you to make
sure that the people who

00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:01.140
would get benefit
from this product,

00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:03.900
to get them access
to the Play Console

00:31:03.900 --> 00:31:06.900
and share the data as broadly as
possible with your colleagues,

00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:09.600
so you know where you can
improve and make better data

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.600
driven decisions.

00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.640
Now in terms of how to
select your peer set,

00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:16.760
I'd recommend picking apps
that you aspire to be like,

00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.010
and updating it when
the market changes.

00:31:22.940 --> 00:31:25.660
ADAM CARPENTER: And so, all
these benchmarks and everything

00:31:25.660 --> 00:31:28.810
are really powerful, really
insightful, really something

00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:31.960
that I hope can provide
a lot of actionability

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:34.660
for you as you look at your
game or your app's performance

00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:36.132
relative to your competitors.

00:31:36.132 --> 00:31:37.840
And I'm really hopeful
that you guys will

00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:40.660
be able to set targets
for future releases,

00:31:40.660 --> 00:31:42.970
to be able to aspire
to make improvements,

00:31:42.970 --> 00:31:45.672
and how you can actually
grow your business.

00:31:45.672 --> 00:31:47.380
And, when I really
think about everything

00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:50.470
we've been talking about today,
this hierarchical model, how

00:31:50.470 --> 00:31:52.780
everything feeds together,
and all of the features

00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:55.570
that we're adding to the
console, I really get inspired,

00:31:55.570 --> 00:31:57.340
and I really get
excited, because things

00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.130
like refreshing the
core metrics, that's

00:31:59.130 --> 00:32:01.720
going to be significantly more
meaningful and significantly

00:32:01.720 --> 00:32:04.120
more insightful than any of
the information we have there

00:32:04.120 --> 00:32:05.120
today.

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:07.000
Additionally, just
being able to cut users

00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.100
based on whether they're
new or they're returning,

00:32:09.100 --> 00:32:11.770
it's going to help you kind
of decompose your active users

00:32:11.770 --> 00:32:14.830
and get a sense for, how is
it growing and shrinking,

00:32:14.830 --> 00:32:17.020
and just fundamentally how
is that audience changing

00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.200
over time.

00:32:18.200 --> 00:32:20.500
Additionally, those
change analysis charts

00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:23.470
that Corina was talking about,
that's especially important

00:32:23.470 --> 00:32:25.833
because, as she mentioned,
normalized metrics,

00:32:25.833 --> 00:32:27.250
they're really the
fundamental way

00:32:27.250 --> 00:32:29.110
that she should be
evaluating her business.

00:32:29.110 --> 00:32:33.790
Absolute numbers, revenue, DAU,
those are the vanity metrics

00:32:33.790 --> 00:32:35.820
and they tend to be
lacking indicators.

00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:37.660
Normalized metrics
are more often

00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:39.740
going to be leading
indicators that provide you

00:32:39.740 --> 00:32:43.030
with solid science about how
your app or game is trending

00:32:43.030 --> 00:32:45.700
prior to it impacting
your daily active users

00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:47.650
or impacting your revenue.

00:32:47.650 --> 00:32:49.510
And so, as I think
about all of this

00:32:49.510 --> 00:32:53.290
and how it fits together, user
perceptions of quality, vitals,

00:32:53.290 --> 00:32:56.350
benchmarks, it's going to
give all of you in the room,

00:32:56.350 --> 00:32:58.000
everybody out
there in the world,

00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.160
significantly more
intelligent insights

00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.140
into just, what is
the user experience

00:33:02.140 --> 00:33:04.900
like, how are they
enjoying your app or game,

00:33:04.900 --> 00:33:06.880
and where are the biggest
opportunities for you

00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:08.300
to actually grow?

00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:10.270
Especially in light
of the benchmarks

00:33:10.270 --> 00:33:12.040
that we're actually
adding to the console,

00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.623
because now you're going to have
a real good understanding of,

00:33:14.623 --> 00:33:15.665
what does good look like?

00:33:15.665 --> 00:33:17.748
And that was always what
I had a problem with when

00:33:17.748 --> 00:33:19.000
I was on the developer side.

00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:20.350
What's good?

00:33:20.350 --> 00:33:21.850
Because as much as
I knew everything

00:33:21.850 --> 00:33:23.440
I could possibly
know about my app,

00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.388
I had no idea of the
competitive landscape.

00:33:25.388 --> 00:33:27.430
And so this is where we're
adding to the console,

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:30.040
to expose those competitive
insights to yourselves,

00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:33.760
and enable you to optimize and
grow your business over time.

00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:35.812
And so thank you all very
much for coming today.

00:33:35.812 --> 00:33:37.270
Hope you all got
a lot out of this,

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:38.770
and I hope you really
get a lot of value

00:33:38.770 --> 00:33:40.570
out of actually working
with the console.

00:33:40.570 --> 00:33:41.403
Thank you very much.

00:33:41.403 --> 00:33:43.650
