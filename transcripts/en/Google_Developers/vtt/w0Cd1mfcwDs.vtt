Jessica Stanton: We do free online invitation,
guest list, party management for everyone.

00:00:13.792 --> 00:00:17.833
The reasons that people generally seem
to use our system over anything else

00:00:17.833 --> 00:00:20.958
is the personalization
and the long-standing name.

00:00:20.958 --> 00:00:23.042
It's like people will say "Kleenex,"
not "facial tissue."

00:00:23.042 --> 00:00:26.042
They'll say "Evite,"
not "some invitation online."

00:00:26.042 --> 00:00:29.458
And there are certain systems out
there that seem to be more of a--

00:00:29.458 --> 00:00:30.083
like a push.

00:00:30.083 --> 00:00:33.250
Like, "This is what I'm doing" 
as opposed to a "Hey best friends.

00:00:33.250 --> 00:00:35.333
I'd like you to come to
my housewarming party."

00:00:35.333 --> 00:00:38.375
And a lot of people that use it prefer
the designs that we have

00:00:38.375 --> 00:00:41.583
or the customization with that
or inserting their child's picture in,

00:00:41.583 --> 00:00:44.500
so that it makes it
especially special for them.

00:00:44.500 --> 00:00:49.583
It's a nice medium between just an email
and sending out a paper invitation.

00:00:52.875 --> 00:00:56.250
The things that made App Engine
especially desirable for us

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:59.667
are the auto-scaling
and a lot of the monitoring systems.

00:00:59.667 --> 00:01:00.958
A lot of the things that are built-in 

00:01:00.958 --> 00:01:04.667
that would be a little bit more difficult
for us to just build on our own

00:01:04.667 --> 00:01:07.333
because the team itself
is maybe five developers.

00:01:07.333 --> 00:01:10.625
So such an all-inclusive package
has been very useful.

00:01:10.625 --> 00:01:12.667
And it's been very good to us.

00:01:12.667 --> 00:01:16.333
So it seems to me that the opportunities
that App Engine has afforded to us

00:01:16.333 --> 00:01:19.542
is more time to do what we need to do

00:01:19.542 --> 00:01:22.125
to just get things done 
and to get new features out

00:01:22.125 --> 00:01:27.958
and not have to worry
so much about load

00:01:27.958 --> 00:01:32.750
- and things going down because we take
on 16 to 18 million unique users a month.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.583
So it's really nice to see like
instances spin up and come down

00:01:35.583 --> 00:01:37.917
and we never had to touch anything.

00:01:37.917 --> 00:01:40.875
It's just such a great product
that I'm sure more pieces of it

00:01:40.875 --> 00:01:42.625
will be moving on very soon.
