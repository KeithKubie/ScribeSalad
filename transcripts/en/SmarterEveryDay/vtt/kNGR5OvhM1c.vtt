00:00:00.960 --> 00:00:04.880
*Intro music*

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:08.360
Hey. It's Disney World, and it's magic hours

00:00:08.360 --> 00:00:10.980
which means nobody is here so we get to ride everything

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.260
But we've always had this fear of Space Mountain

00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:15.800
that if you put your arms up you'll get 'em chopped off

00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:18.520
so we got this trick we do, show 'em man

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:21.900
This is what we do, because at Space Mountain,

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:24.400
there's absolutely no way you can get your arms chopped off

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.480
if you do "little arms," we call it

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.100
Let's be honest: this is why you go to Disney World, right here

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:37.420
We're the last ones to ride space mountain tonight

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:43.000
*Recording over PA*: Remain seated, and keep your hands, arms, feet and legs inside the rocket

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.100
And watch your children

00:00:44.100 --> 00:00:45.780
You're clear for launch!

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:54.260
Girl 1: Wahoo!
Girl 2: Yay!

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:55.340
Destin: Awesome!

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.320
*Screaming*

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.980
*Screaming*

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:43.520
Destin: Well done

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:48.480
Destin: Nice

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.160
Hey, it's me, Destin, and I met some really cool workers at Space Mountain

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.800
And they're gonna tell you something you didn't know, so you can get Smarter Every Day

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:59.920
Destin: Tell me something about Space Mountain

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:02.480
Emily: It's 27 miles an hour (both sides) on the track

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:06.580
Lesly: Contrary to popular belief, "A side" and "B side" are Alpha and Omega

00:02:06.580 --> 00:02:07.800
They are the same

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:10.800
Destin: Space Mountain is the same - it's symmetric

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.720
I didn't know that. Do you know something else?

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:15.080
Katie: Sure. There is no Rocket #13

00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:16.440
Destin: There's no Rocket #13?

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.380
Katie: We have one through twelve, and then sixteen to thirty-one

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.960
Destin: That's awesome! Does anybody else know anything?

00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.340
Emily: Your hands will not get chopped off if you go like this-

00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.220
*Interrupting* Lesly: Yes! You can put your hands in the air!

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:27.700
Emily: You can put your hands in the air

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:30.460
Destin: I have been scared ALL WEEK about putting my hands up

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:32.800
And they said they won't get chopped off

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.740
Lesly: But don't put 'em up in the tunnel

00:02:34.740 --> 00:02:36.360
Wait until you get out of the tunnel-

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.280
*Interrupting* Destin: You have to be out of the tunnel. 'Cause we can touch the tunnel

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:38.860
Alright

00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:39.360
*Laughs*

00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.820
Chelsea: Only attraction with no hidden Mickeys

00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:42.200
Destin: No hidden Mickeys?

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:43.380
Chelsea: No hidden Mickeys

00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:46.620
It was also built in 1975 and has been the same track since 1975

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.260
Destin: Really?

00:02:47.260 --> 00:02:50.420
Chelsea: It's completely designed by Walt Disney and took 10 years to build

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:51.920
Destin: That's awesome

00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:53.240
*Group applauds*
*Repeating* Destin: That's awesome

00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:54.460
Destin: Thanks guys. Have a great one.

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:56.440
Staff: You're welcome. Have a great weekend!
Staff: Bye

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.620
*Flamboyant* You are getting smarter every day

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.700
Destin: Dude, there's people everywhere scared of getting their arms chopped off

00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:06.320
What's up with that? Look at these people!

00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.520
*Music*

00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.220
*Distorted lyrics*: Smarter

00:03:11.220 --> 00:03:13.540
*Distorted lyrics*: Every

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.220
*Distorted lyrics*: Day
