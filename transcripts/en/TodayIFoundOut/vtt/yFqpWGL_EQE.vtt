00:00:03.110 --> 00:00:18.449
If you go and look up a photo of a boxer from
the 19th century, it’s almost certain that

00:00:18.449 --> 00:00:23.130
the individual will be standing like the gentlemen
pictured right.

00:00:23.130 --> 00:00:27.550
While it may look a little silly to modern
fans of the sport, this was actually a very

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:32.340
effective fighting stance for those wishing
to win a 19th century boxing match.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:37.070
For anyone unfamiliar, the reason this old
timey, once ubiquitous, “fisticuffs stance”

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:43.329
is so mocked or derided by fans of the sport
today is for the glaring weaknesses inherent

00:00:43.329 --> 00:00:49.550
to it, namely that the boxer stands with their
hands low and their chin up- a great way to

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:51.590
get your head pummeled.

00:00:51.590 --> 00:00:55.760
While it’s certainly true that a person
utilising the fisticuffs stance would be in

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:00.160
trouble in a modern day boxing match, a modern
boxer would likely be in just as much trouble

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:05.339
sparring off against a pugilistic champ from
the golden age of boxing, if they boxed by

00:01:05.339 --> 00:01:06.710
the rules of the period.

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:11.080
As for why, most pertinent here is the fact
that neither boxer would be wearing gloves

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.660
in such a classic match.

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:17.049
As paradoxical as it’s going to sound, boxing
without gloves is actually widely considered

00:01:17.049 --> 00:01:21.970
to be safer than boxing with them, among other
reasons because bare knuckle boxers rarely

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.350
punched one another in the head with full
force, so the risk of brain injury or knockout

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:27.580
was dramatically lower.

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:32.270
You see, lacking protective hand gear, punching
someone in the head with every ounce of your

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:38.140
physical might is a great way to very seriously
injury your hands, particularly when done

00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.140
repeatedly.

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:42.060
Combine this with the fact that many 19th
century boxers sometimes competed multiple

00:01:42.060 --> 00:01:46.680
times per week and that there were no time
limits for many old timey bouts (one match

00:01:46.680 --> 00:01:52.920
in 1893 even went 111 rounds, see Bonus Facts
below), and you begin to see why protecting

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.409
the head wasn’t as much of a concern as
it is today.

00:01:56.409 --> 00:02:01.260
While blows to the head did happen, particularly
if a clean shot to the cheek could be had,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.479
the head tended not to be the focus.

00:02:03.479 --> 00:02:08.860
(This aversion to headshots is believed to
be one of the reasons so many old timey pugilists

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:14.870
were able to compete so frequently and keep
boxing for upwards of three decades in some

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.250
cases, all the while maintaining their mental
faculties well into old age.)

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:22.300
So that explains why the stance doesn’t
have the hands more directly protecting the

00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:29.510
head like today, but why the specific hand
position of left arm out and right arm tucked?

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:34.240
Among other benefits, this is partially linked
to another, often overlooked rule of early

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:35.340
boxing bouts.

00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:40.290
Prior to the Queensbury rules officially introduced
in the 1860s and proliferating from there,

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:44.940
the rules of specific prize fights between
pugilists varied, but invariably allowed grappling.

00:02:44.940 --> 00:02:50.090
As an example of how things were before more
civilised competitions, in 1713, Sir Thomas

00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:54.970
Parkyns described a typical boxing match as
including eye-gouging, choking, punching,

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:58.080
head-butting and other such street fighting
tactics.

00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.950
This all changed when Jack Broughton developed
the first set of formalized rules for boxing

00:03:02.950 --> 00:03:04.569
in 1743.

00:03:04.569 --> 00:03:08.800
The impetus for these rules came, in part,
from Broughton’s defeat of George Stevenson,

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.530
who suffered severe injuries and died a few
days after the pair’s fight.

00:03:12.530 --> 00:03:16.920
Saddened by the death of his competitor, Broughton
wrote the “Broughton Rules” to minimize

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:21.349
the harsher aspects of the sport, like forbidding
striking below the belt, not allowing hitting

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:26.180
a competitor when he was down and giving him
30 seconds to recover and continue the fight,

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.720
lest he be declared the loser.

00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:32.159
However, one thing Broughton’s rules did
allow was the aforementioned grappling.

00:03:32.159 --> 00:03:36.629
tn_mcgovern1902As a result, the boxing stance
of the era emphasized keeping distance between

00:03:36.629 --> 00:03:40.010
yourself and your opponent, usually with both
arms outstretched.

00:03:40.010 --> 00:03:44.569
Later, thanks to an individual we’ll talk
about shortly, it switched to just keeping

00:03:44.569 --> 00:03:46.690
your left hand outstretched.

00:03:46.690 --> 00:03:50.239
This not only made for a potential minor offensive
weapon your opponent had to worry about if

00:03:50.239 --> 00:03:54.220
they tried to come in close, but also was
great for teasing out and defending against

00:03:54.220 --> 00:03:56.770
jabs and glancing blows from a distance.

00:03:56.770 --> 00:04:01.769
The tucked right (dominant for most) hand
being held close helped defend against counter

00:04:01.769 --> 00:04:05.310
hooks and body blows when your opponent managed
to get past your left arm.

00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:09.569
And, of course, the arm was cocked and ready
to deliver more powerful blows.

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:13.800
Keeping both arms tucked would simply allow
your opponent too easy grappling access to

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.940
your main trunk.

00:04:14.940 --> 00:04:17.959
As for how this stance became popularised,
this appears to be in large part thanks to

00:04:17.959 --> 00:04:21.769
an 18th century prize fighter called Daniel
Mendoza.

00:04:21.769 --> 00:04:25.969
Before Mendoza, boxing matches tended to consist
of two men more or less beating on each other

00:04:25.969 --> 00:04:29.039
in any way possible until one of them couldn’t
get up anymore.

00:04:29.039 --> 00:04:34.189
These matches were more of a show of manliness
and brute strength than the subtle art that

00:04:34.189 --> 00:04:35.389
would soon develop.

00:04:35.389 --> 00:04:39.479
Investing too much effort in defending yourself
or even taking the complete “coward’s”

00:04:39.479 --> 00:04:43.439
way out and attempting to full on duck and
dodge regularly wasn’t something the fighters

00:04:43.439 --> 00:04:44.439
really did.

00:04:44.439 --> 00:04:48.919
That’s not to say they put no thought into
defence- as mentioned, keeping two arms outstretched

00:04:48.919 --> 00:04:54.080
was a classic stance of the period- it’s
just that Mendoza took it to a whole new level.

00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:59.389
daniel_mendozaHis style developed out of necessity,
Mendoza stood at only 5 ft. 7 in.

00:04:59.389 --> 00:05:06.120
(1.7 m) and about 160 pounds (73 kg) in a
time when boxing was invariably dominated

00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:08.580
by the biggest and strongest men.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:14.400
But thanks to his “scientific” approach
to boxing, Mendoza in turn dominated opponents

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:19.680
with relentlessly sneaky offence combined
with heavy emphasis on not just blocking blows,

00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:25.139
but slip and dodging them as well- essentially
he floated like a butterfly and stung like

00:05:25.139 --> 00:05:27.439
a bee before it was cool.

00:05:27.439 --> 00:05:32.789
While many accused him of being a coward for
fighting this way, the results spoke for themselves;

00:05:32.789 --> 00:05:37.110
the little man, despite being much smaller
than most of his opponents, became the Heavyweight

00:05:37.110 --> 00:05:42.990
Champion of England from 1792 to 1795- a true
to life David vs. Goliath personification,

00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.669
making Mendoza exceptionally popular with
the masses.

00:05:46.669 --> 00:05:49.339
Mendoza was only finally defeated owing to
his hair.

00:05:49.339 --> 00:05:53.669
In a match against John Jackson who was a
full 4 inches taller and over 40 pounds heavier

00:05:53.669 --> 00:05:58.680
than Mendoza, Jackson managed to grab Mendoza
by the hair and then proceeded to, ironically

00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.509
enough, continually punch him in the face
with his free hand while the other kept a

00:06:02.509 --> 00:06:05.889
firm grip on the hair, ultimately knocking
Mendoza out.

00:06:05.889 --> 00:06:11.169
Nevertheless, Mendoza’s famed career culminated
in him quite literally writing the book on

00:06:11.169 --> 00:06:12.929
“scientific” boxing technique.

00:06:12.929 --> 00:06:18.060
Published in 1792, The Art of Boxing touts
the benefits of counter punching and a solid

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:19.060
defence:

00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:25.029
It must be an invariable rule to stop or parry
your adversary’s right with your left, and

00:06:25.029 --> 00:06:30.270
his left with your right; and both in striking
and parrying, always keep your stomach guarded,

00:06:30.270 --> 00:06:33.250
by barring it with your right or left fore-arm.

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.889
jackThis is advice it would seem most every
notable boxer after Mendoza’s time took

00:06:37.889 --> 00:06:42.190
to heart, as most boxers pictured after his
reign invariably were shown holding one hand

00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:45.039
protectively close to their body and the other
outstretched.

00:06:45.039 --> 00:06:49.960
Prior to this, as previously mentioned, champions
such as Jack Broughton were idealised in drawings

00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:54.659
holding both hands away from the body, leaving
the abdomen somewhat exposed.

00:06:54.659 --> 00:06:57.690
With the introduction of gloves in actual
matches thanks largely to the Queensberry

00:06:57.690 --> 00:07:02.659
rules (before this gloves were mostly just
used in training), boxing forms evolved, with

00:07:02.659 --> 00:07:06.369
the emphasis of the modern stance being protecting
the head from the gloved fist.

00:07:06.369 --> 00:07:11.429
Old traditions die hard, however, and for
a period in the early 20th century, despite

00:07:11.429 --> 00:07:16.610
that bare knuckled bouts had been phased out,
boxers continued to pose like old timey prize

00:07:16.610 --> 00:07:21.210
fighters for publicity stills, even though
they now fought using a different style.

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:28.499
The longest known boxing fight in history
took place in New Orleans on Apr. 6, 1893,

00:07:28.499 --> 00:07:30.699
between Andy Bowen and Jack Burke.

00:07:30.699 --> 00:07:35.699
The fight was for the lightweight world title
and lasted 111 rounds!

00:07:35.699 --> 00:07:40.469
After seven hours of brutal fighting, when
the bell sounded for the 111th round, both

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:45.020
fighters – dazed and exhausted- refused
to come out of their corners and the referee

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.110
ruled the bout as a no contest.

00:07:47.110 --> 00:07:55.479
So yes, after 111 rounds of using their bodies
as punching bags, the contest ended in a tie.

00:07:55.479 --> 00:07:59.449
Jack Marles, a London dentist, introduced
the first mouth guard for boxers in 1902.

00:07:59.449 --> 00:08:03.500
At first, the safety measure to protect a
fighter’s teeth and mouth was used only

00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.500
in training sessions.

00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:08.809
It wasn’t until 1913 that the first boxer
wore one in an official fight.

00:08:08.809 --> 00:08:13.669
It didn’t take long for mouthpieces to catch
on among boxing to reduce injuries to the

00:08:13.669 --> 00:08:16.649
teeth and mouth.

00:08:16.649 --> 00:08:22.199
In the 1999 film “The Hurricane,” starring
Denzel Washington, the 1964 world championship

00:08:22.199 --> 00:08:27.180
bout between Rubin Carter and the former world
middleweight champion, Joey Giardello, is

00:08:27.180 --> 00:08:32.140
portrayed such that Carter clearly won, but
the racist judges ruled that Giardello won

00:08:32.140 --> 00:08:33.990
the match, becoming the world champion.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.479
However, the truth was that Giardello, a member
of both the International Boxing Hall of Fame

00:08:38.479 --> 00:08:43.089
and World Boxing Hall of Fame, dominated that
fight and won fair and square.

00:08:43.089 --> 00:08:47.029
In a CNN interview shortly after the film’s
release, Carter himself discussed this and

00:08:47.029 --> 00:08:51.470
confirmed that Giardello was the rightful
victor of the match, despite what was shown

00:08:51.470 --> 00:08:52.470
in the movie.

00:08:52.470 --> 00:08:55.839
This creative liberty taken by the film makers
resulted in Giardello suing them.

00:08:55.839 --> 00:09:20.630
They ultimately settled out-of-court with
Giardello for an undisclosed sum.
