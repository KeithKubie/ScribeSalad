00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.550
&gt;&gt; Well, my view poverty elimination and poverty
eradication, the

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:10.950
highest multiplier that you get in there that
would change the context

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:15.289
of poverty, and by that you can only achieve
through the infrastructure

00:00:15.289 --> 00:00:21.080
particularly, on educational opportunities.
Educational opportunities make a quantum change

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:25.689
in not only being able
to win the war on poverty, but to make sure

00:00:25.689 --> 00:00:29.519
that people who have gone
out of poverty, do not go back into poverty.

00:00:29.519 --> 00:00:34.010
It's the biggest insurance of insuring that
the change from poverty to

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:36.500
normal life is sustainable one.
