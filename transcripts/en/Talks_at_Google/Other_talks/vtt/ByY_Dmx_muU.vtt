00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:13.680
My English is not so good but I’m gonna
explain...

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.450
This was 26th May, just 10 days or a week
ago.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:26.720
I made this performance all by myself,

00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:30.040
and I was collaborating with a violinist

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:31.920
he’s playing now.

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:38.079
He’s from Berliner Philharmonie and he composed
this music for me

00:00:38.079 --> 00:00:42.830
but I think he was very inspired by Japan
and Asia

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.920
so he made this music, and then

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.860
this is my shadow, I’m behind.

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:53.640
And then this picture I took in Tokyo somewhere
in April.

00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.790
So I was doing this behind

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:57.250
with this music

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:04.540
and this was the world premier of the performance
in Osaka.

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.399
And I also did this performance in Berlin,
Germany

00:01:09.399 --> 00:01:11.479
in Berliner Philharmonie, officially.

00:01:11.479 --> 00:01:21.270
This is like winter, but my imagination was
like Japanese birds in snow.

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:22.990
That was my image.

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:24.990
The costume I also created.

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.710
I designed and made it.

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:36.740
So this is kind of like I was doing bird but
also like bird.

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:42.190
I’m dancing with ballet shoes, which is
not point shoes.

00:01:42.190 --> 00:01:59.650
Point shoes is one where I stand on the point.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:30.939
This is the second act already.

00:02:30.939 --> 00:02:34.230
The first act I was trying to do visually

00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:38.220
like using projectors, photos and dance.

00:02:38.220 --> 00:02:46.939
This is like the section that has jazz and
tango with high heels.

00:02:46.939 --> 00:02:50.900
And I'm a classic ballet dance, but now I'm
trying to do everything

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:55.989
now I know how to do everything.

00:02:55.989 --> 00:02:59.249
Also the company I was dancing with in Germany

00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.680
I had to do everything, like contemporary,
classic.

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:09.090
And my mom's a pianist, so she's playing.

00:03:09.090 --> 00:03:10.769
I was born with a musical family.

00:03:10.769 --> 00:03:16.919
My father is a clarinetist, my mother is a
pianist.

00:03:16.919 --> 00:03:22.239
And if I had a sponsor and big budget I wanted
to use big mirrors

00:03:22.239 --> 00:03:24.719
and also hanging on top

00:03:24.719 --> 00:03:28.480
but I couldn't manage it, that's all I could
do.

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:31.379
Because I did it all by myself for this one.

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:41.199
I had limited budget and possibility, and
also technology.

00:03:41.199 --> 00:03:43.230
And this is my father.

00:03:43.230 --> 00:03:48.659
This performance was kind of a thank you to
my parents too.

00:03:48.659 --> 00:03:52.049
Because I left Japan 23 years ago

00:03:52.049 --> 00:03:58.419
and I've been living 23 years by myself without
my parents

00:03:58.419 --> 00:03:59.419
and I don't see them so often

00:03:59.419 --> 00:04:02.249
so I invited them to play with me

00:04:02.249 --> 00:04:11.069
This is me also with the wig.

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:46.550
It's a little bit of a joke.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:05:10.130
This is Bach, one of the most famous classical
composers.

00:05:10.130 --> 00:05:13.790
I was trying to make something out of Bach,
it's very difficult.

00:05:13.790 --> 00:05:17.810
I also did a collaboration with a cellist,
David Geringas.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.520
He's also very famous.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.970
But Bach is very, very challenging.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:35.590
This is not the final one, because every day
I hear music and some new idea comes up.

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:37.500
And...

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.260
This isn't final but I had to do something
on the 26th so I did this.

00:05:42.260 --> 00:05:47.240
But I had more ideas which I couldn't do.

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:50.150
I wanted to dance on top of the air

00:05:50.150 --> 00:05:54.530
and have something like hanging or something,
but...

00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:55.730
I didn't have the possibility.

00:05:55.730 --> 00:06:04.930
So I was just dancing to this.

00:06:04.930 --> 00:06:08.040
And this is like...

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:15.030
This is music from Thai meditation.

00:06:15.030 --> 00:06:30.100
I was trying to do like...

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:40.480
This was kind of like I lost hope.

00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:43.080
For dancing, and life, and everything in the
beginning.

00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.110
And I found the point shoes.

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:48.820
Which was my dream when...

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:53.070
I remember that time.

00:06:53.070 --> 00:07:00.530
I tried to...

00:07:00.530 --> 00:07:03.020
dance.

00:07:03.020 --> 00:07:05.830
This was my...

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:10.920
I don't know if people understood or not.

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:14.010
So this performance I made 3 parts.

00:07:14.010 --> 00:07:15.300
First is visual, like Japanese, a little Asian.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.300
Second part was jazz, tap, tango

00:07:16.300 --> 00:07:19.400
and third, this is the classic part.

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:37.540
And the last one I danced to Swan, which is
my roots.

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:52.420
So I will tell my... this is the swan.

00:07:52.420 --> 00:07:58.410
But in the ballet world it's called the dying
swan.

00:07:58.410 --> 00:07:59.410
Swan's dying.

00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:10.590
One of the very famous solos for females.

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:18.850
Which...

00:08:18.850 --> 00:08:52.041
So this was a week ago...

00:08:52.041 --> 00:09:05.439
that I made it, but...

00:09:05.439 --> 00:09:10.339
I studied ballet in Moscow at Bolshoi Ballet.

00:09:10.339 --> 00:09:15.730
It was like '91 when I first went there.

00:09:15.730 --> 00:09:22.420
At that time it was still like the Soviet
Union, between, you know, the changing period.

00:09:22.420 --> 00:09:29.079
I saw everything, like bombing, a car going
and all this.

00:09:29.079 --> 00:09:32.139
There was no food.

00:09:32.139 --> 00:09:36.630
And shooting all over.

00:09:36.630 --> 00:09:41.040
And drunk pupils laying down in the street.

00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:45.170
And I was 13 when I first went there.

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:49.860
And when I was 15 I... yeah, that was high
school.

00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.529
I left Japan alone.

00:09:51.529 --> 00:09:58.490
At that time, of course I was just talking
with, Google was 19 years, like you know....

00:09:58.490 --> 00:09:59.490
Yeah?

00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:02.509
So it was like '93 when I first left.

00:10:02.509 --> 00:10:05.040
Of course no internet, no cell phone.

00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:08.300
I only had the possibility to write a letter.

00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.759
But it was too cold in the dormitory, so there
was no heating.

00:10:12.759 --> 00:10:15.800
No food, and I was thinking...

00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:19.899
But it must be like this to do something like,
you know...

00:10:19.899 --> 00:10:22.410
That I want to be a ballerina and know how
to do this.

00:10:22.410 --> 00:10:23.709
That was my start.

00:10:23.709 --> 00:10:28.839
So I was writing letters every week sending
to my mother.

00:10:28.839 --> 00:10:33.220
And 2 months later I get letters from my mom.

00:10:33.220 --> 00:10:39.589
Like every week I get some story from 2 months
ago.

00:10:39.589 --> 00:10:41.980
When Gorbachev, if you remember Gorbachev,

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:45.339
when he went out and Yeltsin came

00:10:45.339 --> 00:10:51.369
I couldn't go out of my dormitory, I was 2
months almost kidnapped

00:10:51.369 --> 00:10:54.350
so I couldn't write a letter

00:10:54.350 --> 00:11:01.600
and my mother was thinking, "Maybe I can't
see my daughter again" because...

00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.439
Anyway, that was my start.

00:11:05.439 --> 00:11:07.259
Doing ballet.

00:11:07.259 --> 00:11:08.259
Just ballet.

00:11:08.259 --> 00:11:10.670
It was very strict.

00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.689
After graduating Bolshoi I went to...

00:11:14.689 --> 00:11:20.439
No, actually I was dancing in Moscow stiil,
but I thought,

00:11:20.439 --> 00:11:25.720
it's too difficult because I got only $80
a month for salary.

00:11:25.720 --> 00:11:28.050
It's like nothing.

00:11:28.050 --> 00:11:32.420
But at that time the real estate business
was starting in Russia.

00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:37.139
So I had to pay like $200 a month to rent
a room

00:11:37.139 --> 00:11:43.330
Everybody had like free apartments and stuff
like that, but I didn't so I had to pay.

00:11:43.330 --> 00:11:50.649
So I was thinking I get like $80 and I pay
$200 for my apartment.

00:11:50.649 --> 00:12:00.019
I can't continue because I didn't wanna get
help from my parents.

00:12:00.019 --> 00:12:04.519
I didn't want that, so...

00:12:04.519 --> 00:12:08.399
So I was thinking to do an audition tour.

00:12:08.399 --> 00:12:12.279
But first I wanted to compete in an international
competition in Paris

00:12:12.279 --> 00:12:15.420
and I went to Paris alone.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.269
And then I just opened my eyes!

00:12:19.269 --> 00:12:20.399
Wow, it's beautiful!

00:12:20.399 --> 00:12:23.759
The food is delicious!

00:12:23.759 --> 00:12:25.160
What is this?

00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.740
So beautiful, everything.

00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:30.160
So I was thinking maybe I have to leave Russia.

00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.129
It's too much for me.

00:12:33.129 --> 00:12:40.429
I was thinking I had to do it, but maybe there's
another world...

00:12:40.429 --> 00:12:43.889
So I started touring.

00:12:43.889 --> 00:12:46.490
My audition tour.

00:12:46.490 --> 00:12:49.629
Now it's very easy.

00:12:49.629 --> 00:12:52.910
I search a company and there's so much information.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.589
Applications you send in seconds.

00:12:55.589 --> 00:12:59.119
Photos, resume, finish.

00:12:59.119 --> 00:13:01.429
But I had to search by magazines.

00:13:01.429 --> 00:13:05.029
Telephone number, calling, no answer.

00:13:05.029 --> 00:13:06.810
Sending photos takes one week.

00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:08.779
Get it or not, you don't know.

00:13:08.779 --> 00:13:09.860
So that was that time.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.870
So anyway, I had to go.

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:14.939
So I bought one-way ticket to Berlin.

00:13:14.939 --> 00:13:16.420
Why Berlin?I don't know.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:18.589
It was the cheapest I could find.

00:13:18.589 --> 00:13:19.899
So I went to Berlin.

00:13:19.899 --> 00:13:26.420
Starting I went to a company, that I danced
with 10 years later,

00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:30.670
but the director was not there, so I couldn't
audition.

00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:31.749
That was my first audition.

00:13:31.749 --> 00:13:34.309
So I was like, "Wow, OK!"

00:13:34.309 --> 00:13:37.660
So I searched the next day...

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:39.540
Munich audition.

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:40.870
I decided to go.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:43.920
I bought a train ticket and went to Munich.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:45.769
That was a cool audition.

00:13:45.769 --> 00:13:48.029
10 year old kids auditioning.

00:13:48.029 --> 00:13:52.309
So that was my second audition.

00:13:52.309 --> 00:13:56.910
It's very difficult to get a job.

00:13:56.910 --> 00:14:01.720
It's still difficult, but I had a dream to
be a ballerina,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:05.459
so I want to do everything by myself.

00:14:05.459 --> 00:14:13.230
So I went all over the place and saving money,
so I was taking night trains

00:14:13.230 --> 00:14:18.540
going all around Switzerland, ended up in
London.

00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:19.540
England.

00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:21.860
I went to Dover over in the ferry.

00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:25.180
So I came back 3 weeks later

00:14:25.180 --> 00:14:30.300
My company I was dancing with in Moscow, I
told them 3 days

00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.610
I wouldn't come for 3 days.

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:36.550
So 3 weeks later I came back, and I was OK.

00:14:36.550 --> 00:14:40.509
Moscow and the company, I'm very thankful.

00:14:40.509 --> 00:14:47.550
Of course, I was not fired.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:51.160
But the next year I went to Germany.

00:14:51.160 --> 00:14:53.740
That tour I got two contracts.

00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.019
That auditioning tour.

00:14:56.019 --> 00:14:59.480
So I went to Germany, but that was...

00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:02.999
But that was not what I want to do, it was
too contemporary.

00:15:02.999 --> 00:15:10.160
Now I do everything like this, but I was studying
in Russia and it was pure classic.

00:15:10.160 --> 00:15:11.160
Only classic.

00:15:11.160 --> 00:15:16.230
I was thinking ballet it just point shoes,
Swan Lake and that's it.

00:15:16.230 --> 00:15:18.189
In Germany it's very advanced.

00:15:18.189 --> 00:15:22.050
But you have to dance barefoot or naked or
with projector.

00:15:22.050 --> 00:15:24.800
I was like, "Wow!"

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.809
I couldn't enjoy that.

00:15:26.809 --> 00:15:30.339
It was too new for me.

00:15:30.339 --> 00:15:36.759
I was also kind of homesick, because in Germany
the pupils work, finish, go home, and that's

00:15:36.759 --> 00:15:37.759
it.

00:15:37.759 --> 00:15:44.079
And Russia of course it's money, no money,
whatever, but the pupils are always together.

00:15:44.079 --> 00:15:45.749
Helping each other.

00:15:45.749 --> 00:15:47.209
At that time especially.

00:15:47.209 --> 00:15:49.250
It was very warm.

00:15:49.250 --> 00:15:54.329
I didn't have money or anything, but I was
very happy always.

00:15:54.329 --> 00:15:55.689
And I was very warm.

00:15:55.689 --> 00:15:58.869
I think that was the art power.

00:15:58.869 --> 00:16:01.999
And in Germany of course I got monthly pay

00:16:01.999 --> 00:16:05.160
But I was thinking "Why am I doing this?"

00:16:05.160 --> 00:16:09.449
Because I was not happy, and after work I
go home alone.

00:16:09.449 --> 00:16:10.571
And doing nothing.

00:16:10.571 --> 00:16:18.369
So I started thinking maybe I have to find
the next step.

00:16:18.369 --> 00:16:20.990
This is not my place.

00:16:20.990 --> 00:16:24.649
So I went to do a competition in America

00:16:24.649 --> 00:16:30.709
because I learned it's faster to go to competition
and meet everybody

00:16:30.709 --> 00:16:35.230
than going one place, the next place...

00:16:35.230 --> 00:16:39.779
So I went to the competition...

00:16:39.779 --> 00:16:41.779
not...

00:16:41.779 --> 00:16:45.420
thinking about getting something, but meeting
pupils there, getting contacts, and maybe

00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:51.220
get a new idea or possibility.

00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.699
So that competition had one director and he
gave me a contract.

00:16:55.699 --> 00:16:57.600
I didn't get any prize.

00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.730
I was a finalist.

00:16:58.730 --> 00:17:01.920
But I got an offer from America.

00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:06.309
So I was thinking for 2 days, calling my mom
asking "What do you think?"

00:17:06.309 --> 00:17:08.170
"Shall I try or not?"

00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:10.250
And my mom and my father

00:17:10.250 --> 00:17:12.670
"I don't know!

00:17:12.670 --> 00:17:13.690
You know better!"

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:14.950
"So you decide!"

00:17:14.950 --> 00:17:16.660
That was my parents.

00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:24.970
So one day I think, if I don't try at this
moment, maybe I'll never have the chance again.

00:17:24.970 --> 00:17:34.580
Because if I go to the audition in America
and don't get it, so I was thinking,

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.580
OK, I'll try.

00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:37.470
So I went back to Germany

00:17:37.470 --> 00:17:40.730
got everything, send the suitcase

00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:46.750
and in 2 months I was in America.

00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:48.540
Indianapolis.

00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:58.170
So I danced in Indianapolis, and the next
year my big dream was dancing Swan Lake full

00:17:58.170 --> 00:17:59.170
rank.

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:04.980
Odette and Odile, there's two swans, white
and black.

00:18:04.980 --> 00:18:08.990
That was one of my dreams.

00:18:08.990 --> 00:18:13.410
But the Indianapolis dance company was only
25 dancers.

00:18:13.410 --> 00:18:15.640
It was not possible.

00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:20.090
So I went to audition and got a contract in
Cleveland San Jose Ballet

00:18:20.090 --> 00:18:22.690
where I could dance Swan Lake.

00:18:22.690 --> 00:18:24.360
I invited my parents

00:18:24.360 --> 00:18:30.830
to say thank you, and that was a very touching
moment for me.

00:18:30.830 --> 00:18:33.560
But the company went bankrupt the next year

00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:40.610
American ballet company was almost...

00:18:40.610 --> 00:18:49.700
The budget was by sponsors.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.590
Something didn't go well and that's it.

00:18:53.590 --> 00:18:54.590
Very dangerous.

00:18:54.590 --> 00:18:59.680
Germany is the government supporting it.

00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.060
But it went bankrupt so I had to find a new
job.

00:19:03.060 --> 00:19:05.770
So I went to San Jose California for one year.

00:19:05.770 --> 00:19:08.590
And after Boston for two years.

00:19:08.590 --> 00:19:09.780
And then when I was at Boston

00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:15.570
September 11th happened.

00:19:15.570 --> 00:19:20.570
11 pupils got fired a week later.

00:19:20.570 --> 00:19:27.160
It was very, very dangerous moment for everybody.

00:19:27.160 --> 00:19:28.820
Dangerous means no activity.

00:19:28.820 --> 00:19:32.350
The people didn't go out.

00:19:32.350 --> 00:19:33.350
Just stayed at home.

00:19:33.350 --> 00:19:42.820
Our business, the show business, if there's
no audience the show doesn't go on.

00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:50.420
So I was thinking this is also...

00:19:50.420 --> 00:19:52.810
Pupils only talk about money.

00:19:52.810 --> 00:19:55.880
And I'm not dancing for money only.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:59.510
And I was thinking maybe I have to leave America.

00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:04.700
And I was thinking my first audition I couldn't
do was in Berlin.

00:20:04.700 --> 00:20:06.540
Maybe I have to go back to Berlin.

00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:10.121
Because at that time of course you don't know
but

00:20:10.121 --> 00:20:14.630
there was a world wide star dancer.

00:20:14.630 --> 00:20:15.710
Very famous.

00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:18.630
He was going to take over Berlin ballet.

00:20:18.630 --> 00:20:22.230
As one big company.

00:20:22.230 --> 00:20:25.590
Berlin had three companies.

00:20:25.590 --> 00:20:30.290
Staatsoper, Deutsche Oper and Komische Oper
because

00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.691
of the wall.

00:20:33.691 --> 00:20:35.450
West Berlin and East Berlin.

00:20:35.450 --> 00:20:36.500
It was separated.

00:20:36.500 --> 00:20:42.910
They had like three companies but tried to
make it one big company.

00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:44.630
It was 2004.

00:20:44.630 --> 00:20:48.650
They did a very big audition worldwide.

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:55.070
So I went there because I thought maybe I
have to do this audition and finish my career.

00:20:55.070 --> 00:21:02.840
Because I couldn't do it when I was 19.

00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840
Then I was 25.

00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:07.890
But then he gave me a contract in Berlin.

00:21:07.890 --> 00:21:10.021
So I think...

00:21:10.021 --> 00:21:15.310
It was 2004 and I was starting dancing 10
years with the Berlin Staatsballett.

00:21:15.310 --> 00:21:19.050
Which is very stable, because every month
I get paid

00:21:19.050 --> 00:21:22.570
No matter if I'm sick or injured

00:21:22.570 --> 00:21:26.860
and it was a very nice time

00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:31.670
I liked my after work time.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.320
That's why I now do collaborations.

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:41.600
I went to Philharmony opera and met lots of
interesting artists, painters and...

00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:42.600
Architects.

00:21:42.600 --> 00:21:48.020
Like, how to say...

00:21:48.020 --> 00:21:51.750
Technicians.

00:21:51.750 --> 00:21:55.290
But like projector techniques.

00:21:55.290 --> 00:21:59.510
So I was collaborating with very interesting
technical pupils.

00:21:59.510 --> 00:22:03.420
Did a performance in a swimming pool.

00:22:03.420 --> 00:22:08.990
Or stations or churches.

00:22:08.990 --> 00:22:12.410
And very important thing as an artist

00:22:12.410 --> 00:22:23.400
there's no limit, or no end, because I have
like new ideas every day.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:29.610
And I want to try these till the end of my
career.

00:22:29.610 --> 00:22:34.690
I think for classic ballet dancers this is
the end.

00:22:34.690 --> 00:22:37.861
Maybe at 40 years old you can still dance
but it's very difficult.

00:22:37.861 --> 00:22:43.130
But if you collaborate with someone, or music,

00:22:43.130 --> 00:22:46.250
I think I can continue more.

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:53.360
But I'm also doing lots of things for young
talent.

00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:00.720
Organizing workshops in Berlin, Europe.

00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.120
Now next month I'm going to America

00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:08.970
Boston and New York, taking 28 students.

00:23:08.970 --> 00:23:14.170
And August Bolshoi Ballet where I started.

00:23:14.170 --> 00:23:17.840
So this is my kind of roots.

00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:20.800
As a ballerina

00:23:20.800 --> 00:23:29.110
we start at like 10am because we had about
10 performances a month.

00:23:29.110 --> 00:23:33.930
A hundred performance a year.

00:23:33.930 --> 00:23:35.460
In Berlin.

00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:37.130
But in Russia we had more.

00:23:37.130 --> 00:23:38.740
Maybe 200 performances.

00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:39.740
Every day different.

00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:43.820
Swan Lake, Nutcracker, Sleeping Beauty, every
day different.

00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:48.760
In the morning we start with on and a half
hour training

00:23:48.760 --> 00:23:56.150
Taking bar, doing some movements, bending,
stretching and doing this.

00:23:56.150 --> 00:24:00.970
And after one and a half hours we do maybe
like 6 hours rehearsal.

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.070
In Germany it's very strict, we have 7 hours
working time

00:24:05.070 --> 00:24:09.430
and if you go over they have to pay overtime.

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.010
It's the seven hours but dancing.

00:24:11.010 --> 00:24:12.690
Our job is dancing.

00:24:12.690 --> 00:24:17.780
So 7 hours dancing, or doing like 4 hours
rehearsal, little break, and then performance

00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:21.860
and next day the same.

00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:28.680
It's very hard, but if you get used to it,
it's normal.

00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:38.400
What do I have left to talk about.

00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:47.090
Everyone always asks what I'm eating mostly.

00:24:47.090 --> 00:24:50.540
But I think as dancers we

00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.950
Maybe mens eat lunch

00:24:52.950 --> 00:24:57.110
but we continue because we have only like
half an hour break

00:24:57.110 --> 00:25:02.130
and we can't eat so much, because we eat a
lot and can't dance again.

00:25:02.130 --> 00:25:04.650
You'll get a stomach ache.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:11.610
So we have breakfast and like coffee or Coke,
caffeine and sugar.

00:25:11.610 --> 00:25:16.350
Keep going till like 5 or 6pm

00:25:16.350 --> 00:25:18.821
and if we have a performance we eat a little
something

00:25:18.821 --> 00:25:24.710
to get energy, and then we eat a lot after
the performance.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:25.990
Very unhealthy.

00:25:25.990 --> 00:25:31.310
10 or 11pm is our dinner time.

00:25:31.310 --> 00:25:35.090
This is our food schedule, so to say.

00:25:35.090 --> 00:25:42.800
Another thing is the point shoes for the ballerina.

00:25:42.800 --> 00:25:44.600
It's very painful in the beginning

00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:47.970
but when you get used to it you don't feel
pain.

00:25:47.970 --> 00:25:49.970
It's painful but normal.

00:25:49.970 --> 00:26:00.130
Then I have very big bunions so I can't really
wear high heels.

00:26:00.130 --> 00:26:04.140
But you have to do with point shoes.

00:26:04.140 --> 00:26:07.720
And men are always behind supporting the women.

00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:09.740
You have to do like...

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:18.010
Gym, because you carry women which is like
50-55kg

00:26:18.010 --> 00:26:21.000
It's a very unusual profession.

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.480
But on stage...

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:28.880
To make one stage, 2 hours, we practice maybe
like 2 months.

00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:33.350
And you have to do the same thing every day,
one and a half hours.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:36.470
Every day the same things, like hanging, and
this, and stretch

00:26:36.470 --> 00:26:38.760
and then starting rehearsal.

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:41.440
Rehearsal is like easiest..

00:26:41.440 --> 00:26:46.300
No, the performance is the easiest part.

00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.620
And you smile and dance and go back and then
you die.

00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:54.150
This is our job.

00:26:54.150 --> 00:27:00.950
But I think these are the last moments for
doing live performance.

00:27:00.950 --> 00:27:08.330
Also like Berline Philharmony, if you go and
see it live you get goosebumps

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:15.550
but now they're doing internet business which
I think is good and bad.

00:27:15.550 --> 00:27:20.270
Because you don't get the same effect, the
same feeling as seeing it live

00:27:20.270 --> 00:27:21.620
Live is live.

00:27:21.620 --> 00:27:22.960
But I'm thinking also like now

00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:29.530
there are too many visual possibility.

00:27:29.530 --> 00:27:33.810
You get YouTube you can watch everything.

00:27:33.810 --> 00:27:38.840
Night, morning, and afternoon.

00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:51.090
This is very good, but I'm thinking live performance
business maybe in 50 years will disappear.

00:27:51.090 --> 00:28:01.340
But I want to continue of course to try to
make new things.
