00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, DC.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.910
&gt;&gt; Stephanie Marcus: Welcome,
this is the final lecture

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:28.770
of our 2017 NASA Goddard series

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:32.280
and we already have eight
planned for next year,

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:34.190
which will be our 12th year.

00:00:34.190 --> 00:00:35.620
We don't have the date set yet,

00:00:35.620 --> 00:00:39.520
but we've got some exciting
things on the horizon.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:45.680
But today I want to welcome you
and I'm glad that you didn't go

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:52.000
to the Zumba party you came
here to expand your minds.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.510
I'm Stephanie Marcus from
the Science, Technology

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:56.440
and Business Division

00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:00.520
and I guess I already
said what I wanted to say.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:03.720
Anyway, I was thinking
back to how

00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:07.050
when I was a little kid we used
to drive around in December

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:09.970
and see all the holiday
light displays.

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:14.840
And a lot of this was before
NASA was even created,

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:18.600
but I never imagined that I'd
be standing next to a scientist

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.360
who can see all of the holiday
lights or any surges in lighting

00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:25.920
across the globe from
space, so it's really --

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.740
we've come an awful long way.

00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:33.180
Today our speaker is
Miguel Roman and he was born

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:37.090
in Puerto Rico, he's
from a very large family,

00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.820
and his uncle was an
electrical engineer there

00:01:39.820 --> 00:01:42.310
and that inspired him
to do that instead

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:45.180
of whatever else he might
be able to do on the island.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:50.200
But when he was still in college
he got a fellowship to NASA

00:01:50.200 --> 00:01:53.150
and was assigned to
an earth scientist

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:56.020
and was absolutely hooked
on science and NASA.

00:01:56.020 --> 00:02:01.840
So, he's ended up there in 2009,
before that he went to Cornell

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.610
and got a master's in systems
engineering and then a PhD

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:09.460
at Boston University
in remote sensing.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.990
His team some of them are
here today, so that's great

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.500
to have a support group.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:19.720
And he will be telling
us how they go

00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:22.520
about creating these
maps, you've got a map

00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:25.080
out there that's hot off the
press, I guess he picked them

00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.130
up Monday so it's
the latest images.

00:02:29.130 --> 00:02:32.020
And he will tell
us how they do that

00:02:32.020 --> 00:02:36.680
and I think it's not all holiday
things because there are a lot

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.960
of places where the lights
have dimmed or gone out due

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.550
to poverty, war and
hurricanes recently.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.780
So, please help me welcome
Miguel Roman to the Library.

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.370
Thank you.

00:02:53.370 --> 00:02:57.630
&gt;&gt; Dr. Miguel Roman: The work
that we do at NASA as defined

00:02:57.630 --> 00:03:00.500
in the National Space
Act Agreement is

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.320
to explore the earth and
understand the earth as a system

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.860
and that provides NASA
with a lot of flexibility

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:10.620
to understand a lot of
different components

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.850
that gives us a wholistic view
of the earth from the space.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:18.680
And the idea here is that we
want to use space as a mean

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.780
to understand all these
different components, the land,

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:24.090
the ocean, the atmosphere,
the ice,

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:28.520
and how we as humans are
also making an impact

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.920
and human activity
is [inaudible] an art

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.810
of the earth's system.

00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.950
The challenge with our system
science is that we always try

00:03:36.950 --> 00:03:40.590
to find what happens when
a small disturbance in any

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.880
of these subsystems can affect
the entire planet as a whole.

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.560
Think of it for instance
what happens

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.760
if you know we release
too much CO2

00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:51.870
in the atmosphere the
planet begins to heat,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:53.720
the ocean becomes acidic.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.810
You know these are questions
that are really difficult

00:03:56.810 --> 00:04:01.000
to answer with just a few
measurements here and there.

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.910
NASA for the last 45
years or so we've tried

00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.370
to tackle the problem of
earth's system understanding

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:15.610
by doing the following, which
is we launch satellites.

00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:20.010
We use these engineering
marbles,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:24.800
these 5,000-pound school
bus-sized satellites

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:29.050
and in them we carry
these instruments and each

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.610
of these instruments have a
purpose, they have a mission

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:34.600
to understand the
different components.

00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.310
One of them could measure
the earth's radiation budget,

00:04:37.310 --> 00:04:39.930
the other one could
measure aerosols,

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:44.280
the other one could
measure images

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.200
which you can then
directly relate

00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:50.070
to some activity patterns
taking place at the surface.

00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:55.010
Our emphasis is to use the
unique vantage point of space

00:04:55.010 --> 00:04:59.160
to understand how the
earth is changing.

00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:02.900
This image is known
as the blue marble,

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:05.630
today is the 45th anniversary

00:05:05.630 --> 00:05:09.790
from the time the Apollo 17
astronaut took this picture

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:13.030
14,000 miles away on their
way to going to the moon,

00:05:13.030 --> 00:05:18.350
December 8, 1970
something, sorry.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:23.380
I can't do that math,
there you go 70.

00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:28.630
And so, how do you become
an [inaudible] scientist,

00:05:28.630 --> 00:05:31.510
it's not like you know
you grow up in Puerto Rico

00:05:31.510 --> 00:05:32.810
and you're saying [inaudible],

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.100
I want to be an [inaudible]
scientist, no it's not.

00:05:38.100 --> 00:05:42.130
Well to answer that question I
need to take you on a quick tour

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:45.840
over the land where I grew
up, which is Puerto Rico.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.720
As Steph was saying, I coming
from a very, very large family.

00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:55.060
This is a picture from our
grandparents' 50th anniversary

00:05:55.060 --> 00:05:59.580
back in 1988, the family has
grown exponentially since then.

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:04.470
Now we have 21 cousins
and most of them and a lot

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:08.160
of extended family they
all live in Puerto Rico.

00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.870
And here we used to go on
trips, we don't have Six Flags

00:06:11.870 --> 00:06:15.360
or Disney in Puerto Rico was
have the Arecibo Observatory,

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.370
we could go out cruising
around La Parguera here.

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.960
This is my here right me

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:24.190
and this is my brother
Jonathan who's now a doctor,

00:06:24.190 --> 00:06:28.770
he's an internist in
Bayamon and that's my mom.

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.740
And another thing that
you're always being told is

00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.100
to appreciate nature because
really about all we have

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.300
on the island and it's free,
it's just like the Library

00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:41.600
of Congress it's free.

00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.400
And that you also
need to respect nature

00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:48.050
because nature has a
way to correct itself

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:50.600
and from the maladies of man.

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.790
This is La Parguera and
you can see the docks here,

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:56.400
this is where my mom is
standing right there.

00:06:56.400 --> 00:07:02.870
And this is La Parguera
after Maria just 60 days ago.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.870
And I'm going to be talking
about Maria later in my talk,

00:07:05.870 --> 00:07:09.230
but I just wanted to give
you a sense of what drove me

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:13.580
to announce that which is that
you know when you witness change

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:18.870
and it impacts your communities
that's quite a telling story.

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:22.130
This is Puerto Rican astronaut
Joe Acaba who's currently

00:07:22.130 --> 00:07:23.720
already in the International
Space Station

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:26.180
and took this image
of Puerto Rico,

00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.260
although it's a little bright
here you can start seeing a lot

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.290
of the defoliation particularly
around flooded areas,

00:07:32.290 --> 00:07:36.290
all the rivers, all
those areas in brown.

00:07:36.290 --> 00:07:40.740
Another thing that we
are really well-known

00:07:40.740 --> 00:07:44.110
in Puerto Rico is our
hot blood, our music,

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:50.190
the fact that we see ourselves
as a community not in terms

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:53.600
of material aspects, but
we see ourselves as part

00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:56.760
of a larger culture that
contributes a lot to the world

00:07:56.760 --> 00:07:58.490
in many different ways.

00:07:58.490 --> 00:08:02.430
And that includes things
like music, our food,

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:05.150
the way we celebrate Christmas.

00:08:05.150 --> 00:08:09.940
We celebrate Christmas like the
longest Christmas in duration.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:12.890
Folks here finish up their
holidays on January 1st I was

00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:16.550
like what, but where's
the Three Kings festival

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:19.860
and the Octavitas, and the San
Sebastian festival that we go

00:08:19.860 --> 00:08:21.160
through up to January 20,

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:24.430
the lights remain
on until January 20.

00:08:24.430 --> 00:08:27.300
And what I try to
impress upon you is

00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:32.070
that all these things
really matter in terms

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:34.650
of understanding how humanity
interacts with the environment

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.450
around us because every time we
do this we're consuming energy.

00:08:39.450 --> 00:08:45.380
And so, that kind
of lead to my trying

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:49.490
to really tackle what are the
biggest challenges that we have

00:08:49.490 --> 00:08:53.420
at NASA in the scope of
understanding humanity's role

00:08:53.420 --> 00:08:57.100
in the earth's system
and that started with,

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.200
I'm very data oriented
and you'll see

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:02.510
that very clearly in my slides.

00:09:02.510 --> 00:09:06.170
But the idea of tackling the
massive amount of information,

00:09:06.170 --> 00:09:09.170
this may sound familiar
and volumes of information

00:09:09.170 --> 00:09:13.580
that we got and try to make
sense of it that's the challenge

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:15.450
that we are going through today.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.890
And so, every time there's
an opportunity for us to talk

00:09:18.890 --> 00:09:20.750
and say look, at least
here's a snapshot

00:09:20.750 --> 00:09:24.120
of what we've learned I
think that's important.

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.450
And so, I went to take
you back 45 years ago

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.360
of what we have done.

00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:32.720
This is an image of
Las Vegas in 1972

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.880
when the first land imaging
satellite was launched by NASA.

00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:42.770
And for 45 years we've been
collecting images every 16 days

00:09:42.770 --> 00:09:46.170
over the entire world
and its land system.

00:09:46.170 --> 00:09:49.590
I want you to notice the
variation in water in Lake Mead

00:09:49.590 --> 00:09:52.480
because as a city
becomes more intense

00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:56.530
and more urbanized you need more
water, you need more resources,

00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:02.780
you are replacing the natural
ecosystem with urban buildup.

00:10:02.780 --> 00:10:07.170
And you can definitely see the
effects that humanity has had

00:10:07.170 --> 00:10:11.020
by just looking at these
long-term measurements

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:12.990
from space.

00:10:12.990 --> 00:10:15.440
And that's one of the values
of earth system science

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:18.270
from the vantage view of space
is just that you collect data

00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.700
for very long periods of
time that is as valuable

00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:25.380
as having an ice score and
understanding past warming

00:10:25.380 --> 00:10:30.690
because it gives you a really
good picture of what's going on.

00:10:30.690 --> 00:10:32.290
Humanity's footprint

00:10:32.290 --> 00:10:35.940
in the earth's system can also
be seen in the atmosphere.

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.870
This is an image composite
of the concentration

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.300
of nitrogen dioxide that's taken

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.840
from the ozone mapping
instrument, an instrument

00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:49.810
that is well-known for
helping us track the reduction

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:53.100
of ozone depletion
in the South Pole.

00:10:53.100 --> 00:10:56.870
We've managed through the mantra
protocol to reduce the ozone,

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.500
meaning that humans can actually
alter the earth for the benefit

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.590
of future generations.

00:11:02.590 --> 00:11:04.460
This is a different type
of gas, this is an ozone,

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:09.250
this is nitrogen dioxide is
a short-lived gas which means

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:12.400
that it quickly combines with
other molecules like water

00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:15.880
to form acid rain, to form
the kind of pollutants

00:11:15.880 --> 00:11:18.160
that impact air quality
and result

00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:20.620
in large cases of
childhood asthma.

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.780
EPA has a full monitoring
program and on [inaudible]

00:11:23.780 --> 00:11:26.570
and all different
types of molecules.

00:11:26.570 --> 00:11:27.870
And what you'll see here is

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.520
that the concentration really
trails the weekly pattern

00:11:31.520 --> 00:11:35.630
that humans take in terms
of routines within the city.

00:11:35.630 --> 00:11:38.350
You can see that by Sunday
when everybody's at church

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:41.630
and they're at Wegman's you know
having brunch with their kids

00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:43.030
because you don't
want to have breakfast

00:11:43.030 --> 00:11:46.190
and you just go to
Wegman's, sorry.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:50.090
You see that the
concentration goes down and now

00:11:50.090 --> 00:11:55.990
if you did om a weekly basis and
on a recurring basis you begin

00:11:55.990 --> 00:11:59.580
to see patterns in the data that
can give you some information

00:11:59.580 --> 00:12:03.320
about the extent of
contamination, but also how

00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:04.990
that contamination
has directly led

00:12:04.990 --> 00:12:09.400
to an actual pattern
of energy use.

00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:11.190
As you'll see, this
is the introduction

00:12:11.190 --> 00:12:15.480
to what we call the black marble
and the posters that you'll find

00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.330
at the front these are the first
ever, this is the first release

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:22.490
of those posters and
[inaudible] one of them here.

00:12:22.490 --> 00:12:26.640
And you might have seen
these posters already,

00:12:26.640 --> 00:12:29.130
we've been generating
them on an annual basis

00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.290
for almost 20 years now.

00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:34.840
The importance -- what I'm
going to do now is I'm going

00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:37.810
to quickly go through how
we actually extract and map

00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.500
of annual nightlights.

00:12:39.500 --> 00:12:43.110
So, you get a sense of not just
the massive amount of data,

00:12:43.110 --> 00:12:45.950
but have a context of
what you're seeing here,

00:12:45.950 --> 00:12:48.520
what does it means that I
see a bright pixel here,

00:12:48.520 --> 00:12:50.970
is that my house,
is that a city.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:52.270
Well let's go through
that quickly.

00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.280
This is the city of
example in Barcelona

00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:59.760
and as you can see here
the entire area is bright.

00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.030
And if you can catch at least
one little [inaudible] pixel,

00:13:04.030 --> 00:13:06.540
then really in terms of
size what we're talking

00:13:06.540 --> 00:13:10.790
about is a 700-square
meter area,

00:13:10.790 --> 00:13:13.650
so it's roughly a three
block by three block area,

00:13:13.650 --> 00:13:16.880
every pixel that you
see is about that size.

00:13:16.880 --> 00:13:21.930
That doesn't mean that we can't
detect a small light emission

00:13:21.930 --> 00:13:25.280
within that area, in fact
we've conducted experiments

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.650
in Puerto Rico and we've
used flashlights like these

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:32.310
and we go all the way to
a very dark spot here,

00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:35.790
this is the [inaudible]
farmland site in Cabo Rojo

00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:39.750
and we brighten up this
[inaudible] wit 12,000 lumens

00:13:39.750 --> 00:13:44.350
of light and we can
see it from space.

00:13:44.350 --> 00:13:46.520
So, it means that you
have this what we call

00:13:46.520 --> 00:13:48.550
in geography the support,

00:13:48.550 --> 00:13:52.280
but inside that support there is
a target and we can detect it,

00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.910
just the same way we can
detect fires from space.

00:13:54.910 --> 00:13:57.270
It doesn't mean that I know
the location of a fire I know

00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:00.190
that the fire is inside
that 1-kilometer area.

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:05.050
The holy grail remote-sensing,
the study of satellite images

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:10.380
from space is to be able to
detect the location of that lamp

00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:13.210
and the intensity of
that energy output,

00:14:13.210 --> 00:14:15.480
that's really the
technical hurdle.

00:14:15.480 --> 00:14:21.360
And it's quite a hurdle because
the data that we get directly

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.610
from the satellite is
not a pretty picture,

00:14:23.610 --> 00:14:24.910
you just don't turn on a camera

00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:27.120
and you get lights
directly there are a lot

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.350
of things happening
in that image.

00:14:29.350 --> 00:14:33.730
This is an actual scan from the
visible imaging radiometer suite

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.730
VIIRS which has this
nighttime instrument known

00:14:36.730 --> 00:14:38.390
as the day-night band.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:43.210
And the image is 3,000
kilometers along the scan

00:14:43.210 --> 00:14:48.870
direction and this image is a
granule of roughly 5 minutes.

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.520
And this is of course
an image of India

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.160
and you can see the
border between India

00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:57.410
and Pakistan right here.

00:14:57.410 --> 00:14:59.380
And roughly about 2.2%

00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.310
of the earth's landmass
is classified as urban.

00:15:02.310 --> 00:15:05.950
That means is that we have using
land sat remember the image

00:15:05.950 --> 00:15:09.060
of Las Vegas, if you count
the number of buildings

00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:14.080
and infrastructure about roughly
only 2% of the total landmass,

00:15:14.080 --> 00:15:18.350
all deserts, you
know trees is urban.

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:21.230
But this is not urbanization
this is energy

00:15:21.230 --> 00:15:25.130
and it's showing you settlements
outside of urban areas just

00:15:25.130 --> 00:15:28.420
so you know not everybody
lives inside a building

00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.470
in this planet, some people
live in rural settlements,

00:15:31.470 --> 00:15:34.820
some people live in internally
displaced settlements.

00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:37.720
And the value of the black
marble as it allows you

00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:42.030
to really measure human
presence not directly related

00:15:42.030 --> 00:15:45.140
to infrastructure, but
related to humanity.

00:15:46.260 --> 00:15:51.070
So, if you take an image like
this, which is one single tile

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:58.700
of one orbit and you combine
5,000 plus orbits you collect

00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:01.960
enough data to create the
black marble on an annual basis

00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.440
and that's roughly 42 terabytes.

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:07.150
If you were doing this
back in the 70's you'd have

00:16:07.150 --> 00:16:10.030
to have the entire
holdings in the Library

00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:13.410
of Congress times four
just to make this map,

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.880
that's how much data
we're talking about.

00:16:15.880 --> 00:16:21.000
And the challenge doesn't stop
there, the NASA program wants

00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.450
to use these measurements
on a daily basis

00:16:24.450 --> 00:16:27.870
and at very fine resolution,
that's the challenge.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.750
So how do we go about
doing that?

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:33.400
Well we need to contend with
all the issues surrounding the

00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.320
collection of images at
night and that's a fact

00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:40.180
that there are many, many,
many different other sources

00:16:40.180 --> 00:16:42.560
of light emissions that
also impact our ability

00:16:42.560 --> 00:16:45.570
to estimate lights
coming from cities.

00:16:45.570 --> 00:16:47.860
And if you're an atmospheric
scientist or you want

00:16:47.860 --> 00:16:51.450
to study the [inaudible] this
is really, really awesome

00:16:51.450 --> 00:16:52.880
because now this is a new source

00:16:52.880 --> 00:16:54.980
so that you can detect
the aurora,

00:16:54.980 --> 00:16:59.090
you can measure concentration
of particles like nightglow.

00:16:59.090 --> 00:17:02.500
But if you're a scientist just
studying human settlements all

00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.550
this is noise.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:07.910
And so, I'm going to go
through a few of these.

00:17:07.910 --> 00:17:10.230
The biggest source
of contamination

00:17:10.230 --> 00:17:12.660
in nighttime data is the moon.

00:17:12.660 --> 00:17:16.130
You can see here that
the moon can reflect

00:17:16.130 --> 00:17:18.990
from the earth's surface and
the surface is very variable

00:17:18.990 --> 00:17:23.460
like in this case desert is very
stable, so it stays very stable.

00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:27.330
You can constrain the amount
of light coming from the moon

00:17:27.330 --> 00:17:29.980
versus light coming
from cities very easily.

00:17:29.980 --> 00:17:33.990
But as soon as you go to another
place like here, this is,

00:17:33.990 --> 00:17:37.140
you know, this is vegetation
around the [inaudible]

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:40.170
of Africa that is changing.

00:17:40.170 --> 00:17:42.300
So, there are many
dynamics, there's a confluence

00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.060
of issues associated with
estimating nightlights

00:17:46.060 --> 00:17:50.370
from space being that we have
multiple emission sources,

00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.940
we have the moon and we have
other sources as I'll show you.

00:17:53.940 --> 00:17:57.990
We have snow, snow is
very bright and if you go,

00:17:57.990 --> 00:18:00.980
like if you look at cities
like Toronto or Montreal

00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.450
and Quebec it looks as
bigger as New York City,

00:18:04.450 --> 00:18:09.390
but it's not really, the extent
is not real it's just a physical

00:18:09.390 --> 00:18:11.960
property known as snow
multiple scattering.

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.340
And by the way, I'm putting all
these books here describing the

00:18:15.340 --> 00:18:19.470
principles behind how we map all
these different characteristics

00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.490
from space.

00:18:21.490 --> 00:18:24.470
And it's very important for us
to characterize snow because 25%

00:18:24.470 --> 00:18:26.300
of human settlements
exhibit some kind

00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:27.950
of snowfall throughout the year.

00:18:27.950 --> 00:18:30.730
And so, if you really
want to get a clean map

00:18:30.730 --> 00:18:34.460
on a daily basis you've
got to measure the snow.

00:18:34.460 --> 00:18:36.790
You also have to measure this
thing known as the atmosphere

00:18:36.790 --> 00:18:39.790
which is in the middle
between you and the city.

00:18:39.790 --> 00:18:42.390
And especially if the atmosphere
becomes disturbed as a result

00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.360
of natural variations
like fires.

00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:49.640
So, these are fires taking
place in Siberia as measured

00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:51.210
from the mode sensor
on [inaudible]

00:18:51.210 --> 00:18:55.340
and you can see them
in here red dots.

00:18:55.340 --> 00:18:56.640
And then here fires at night,

00:18:56.640 --> 00:18:58.970
it's almost like we
have an x-ray vision.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:02.760
And we can actually see
the burn scar of the fires.

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.000
And of course, fires are in
places where people live,

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:06.660
so you have to also
separate fires

00:19:06.660 --> 00:19:10.010
between cities and other areas.

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.810
Here's another emission
source, airglow and Aurora.

00:19:13.810 --> 00:19:16.110
Let's see if this one works.

00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:11.930
The last issue I want to
talk about is vegetation.

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:15.520
If you study cities you have
to study vegetation not only

00:22:15.520 --> 00:22:20.710
because lights have to
penetrate vegetation in order

00:22:20.710 --> 00:22:24.490
to be detected, but also
vegetation is important.

00:22:24.490 --> 00:22:27.580
It helps mediate ecosystem
services and function

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.710
and unless you're like you known
hanging out with [inaudible]

00:22:30.710 --> 00:22:34.640
on the First Moon of Endor
most human settlements are

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.180
in the ground.

00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.760
And so, we have to
develop models

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:43.470
that describe how light passes
through a forest canopy.

00:22:43.470 --> 00:22:46.880
In other words, it's important
to study urban infrastructure,

00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:50.470
but you also have to study
forest urban structure.

00:22:50.470 --> 00:22:53.910
All right, so you
do all these things

00:22:53.910 --> 00:22:57.670
and the takeaway being you have

00:22:57.670 --> 00:23:00.140
to combine all these
measurements,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:02.950
it's not enough just to take
nighttime images you need

00:23:02.950 --> 00:23:05.940
to understand what's
going on during daytime

00:23:05.940 --> 00:23:07.970
so that you can characterize
the vegetation,

00:23:07.970 --> 00:23:10.470
[inaudible] of activity,
etcetera.

00:23:10.470 --> 00:23:12.880
And you can do things like
this, you see the raw image,

00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:16.500
this is Paris at night and
this is a French countryside,

00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:17.900
you can detect where
the clouds are,

00:23:17.900 --> 00:23:21.190
where the aerosol is,
where the snow is.

00:23:21.190 --> 00:23:22.690
This is the alps,
this is [inaudible],

00:23:22.690 --> 00:23:27.030
this is how many
reflections we are to expect.

00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:29.080
And these areas in
green here are areas

00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:31.390
where we're seeing foliage

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:33.780
and there's [inaudible]
below the foliage.

00:23:33.780 --> 00:23:37.000
And what happens is
basically if you don't correct

00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:39.310
for this the entire French
countryside disappears during

00:23:39.310 --> 00:23:40.610
the summer.

00:23:40.610 --> 00:23:41.910
And I know part of that is

00:23:41.910 --> 00:23:44.260
because French people take
longer vacations than Americans,

00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:47.980
but it's also because
there's vegetation structures

00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:49.490
that you need to account for.

00:23:49.490 --> 00:23:54.910
All right, so here's the final
image and so there you go.

00:23:54.910 --> 00:23:59.450
From a daytime image raw to
a daytime black marble image.

00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:00.750
So, the [inaudible] you see

00:24:00.750 --> 00:24:04.810
in the front are
annual, this is daytime.

00:24:04.810 --> 00:24:07.130
Now I can show you all
the lights from space

00:24:07.130 --> 00:24:10.780
because now we can, we
break through that issue.

00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:15.450
And so, here's an
image of the DC area

00:24:15.450 --> 00:24:18.120
and now we have these daily
images we can start slicing them

00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:20.130
by season.

00:24:20.130 --> 00:24:22.060
And what you see here
is a seasonal change

00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:23.360
in nighttime light,
so that means

00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:25.810
that we're comparing
the amount of lighting

00:24:25.810 --> 00:24:28.510
that we see during the
holiday period relative

00:24:28.510 --> 00:24:31.080
to the rest of the year.

00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:34.180
Anywhere you see green you're
seeing an increasing lighting

00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:36.970
of roughly 20 to 30%.

00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:41.650
Notice that the entire
area around congress is red

00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:42.950
because they're out of session,

00:24:42.950 --> 00:24:45.350
you know hopefully they pass
their tax plan before Christmas,

00:24:45.350 --> 00:24:47.840
they'll also be able
to go back [inaudible].

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:51.060
But notice that pretty
much all of Fairfax County

00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.750
or Arlington County, all
Howard County in green.

00:24:54.750 --> 00:24:58.980
And everywhere you see
green there you see increase

00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:01.420
from the lights from space.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.880
And so, and I hope that
I've impressed upon you

00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.640
and I know it became a little
you known technical at the front

00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:09.170
that I showed you that
lamp in Puerto Rico,

00:25:09.170 --> 00:25:12.770
but I hope that you believe me
that if we can detect a lamp

00:25:12.770 --> 00:25:15.930
like that that we can
detect Christmas lights.

00:25:15.930 --> 00:25:18.130
But the question is
what does it mean.

00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:21.770
Here's Baltimore area
you'll notice that unlike DC

00:25:21.770 --> 00:25:25.350
which has a much more
commercial and federal workforce

00:25:25.350 --> 00:25:29.690
that disappears during a holiday
you know we have a lot more

00:25:29.690 --> 00:25:34.610
green inside the densely
populated residential areas.

00:25:34.610 --> 00:25:37.040
There's also an issue of space,

00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:41.410
if in the suburbs
people have larger areas

00:25:41.410 --> 00:25:42.710
to provision lights, whereas

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.200
in the more densely popular
areas the amount of light

00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:47.140
that you can put is just so much

00:25:47.140 --> 00:25:49.370
because there's not
enough space.

00:25:49.370 --> 00:25:53.300
And so, the reason why
this is important it's

00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:55.340
because of the topic of energy.

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:59.510
These measurements are allowing
us to map cities not just

00:25:59.510 --> 00:26:02.200
as a function of their
size, their density,

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:05.890
but as a function
of energy behaviors.

00:26:05.890 --> 00:26:08.310
Behaviors that are
driven by a status,

00:26:08.310 --> 00:26:14.130
behaviors that are driven
by the values of a culture,

00:26:14.130 --> 00:26:16.870
we can see culture from space.

00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:19.430
And in the case of the United
States we can see Christmas

00:26:19.430 --> 00:26:23.620
lights everywhere, meaning that
whether you're rich or poor,

00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:26.010
religious or not everybody
celebrates the holidays.

00:26:26.010 --> 00:26:30.630
And what we know is that
the process is short-term

00:26:30.630 --> 00:26:33.510
and it's shifted,
meaning that people leave,

00:26:33.510 --> 00:26:37.610
people leave their offices
and they go and stay

00:26:37.610 --> 00:26:39.880
in their homes with
their families.

00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.040
So, there's an energy increase,

00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.950
but it's also shifts
in location.

00:26:44.950 --> 00:26:49.330
And when we did research
across other cultures we found

00:26:49.330 --> 00:26:52.180
that the energy signature
is very different

00:26:52.180 --> 00:26:53.480
from that at Christmas.

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.500
Like if we go here to
this is the Middle East,

00:26:57.500 --> 00:27:02.290
this is near Mecca and I'm going
to concentrate on this rock

00:27:02.290 --> 00:27:04.370
from here, you can see here.

00:27:04.370 --> 00:27:08.750
And again, we can measure
small pixels on a daily basis

00:27:08.750 --> 00:27:11.010
so you can get images
like these.

00:27:11.010 --> 00:27:13.950
So, this is raw data
monthly and daily products

00:27:13.950 --> 00:27:15.930
and they're all following
a similar trend,

00:27:15.930 --> 00:27:19.290
but notice the reoccurring
pattern of the holiday.

00:27:19.290 --> 00:27:20.590
And of course, the holiday

00:27:20.590 --> 00:27:24.060
that we're seeing here is not
Christmas but it's the Hajj.

00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:25.730
This is Mount Arafat

00:27:25.730 --> 00:27:29.690
and in Mount Arafat Muslims
come together roughly about,

00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:35.950
up to 10 million pilgrims
come and pray in Mount Arafat

00:27:35.950 --> 00:27:39.240
and they stay here in these
camps, this is known as the city

00:27:39.240 --> 00:27:43.070
of air-conditioned tents,
this is the city of Mina.

00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:47.190
And every one of these tents
has an air-conditioned unit

00:27:47.190 --> 00:27:51.900
that is not your grandpa's way
of doing you know the Hajj,

00:27:51.900 --> 00:27:54.830
this is the new way
of doing the Hajjaj.

00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:58.280
Hag. . And we also the
same effect during Ramadan,

00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.810
but remember the change in
energy use is different,

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:04.640
people are not moving during
these periods, they are staying

00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:05.940
where they are and
they're moving

00:28:05.940 --> 00:28:08.410
and they're shifting all
their energy use at night.

00:28:08.410 --> 00:28:11.590
And that's a different
sociocultural construct

00:28:11.590 --> 00:28:15.010
because what we've learned
is that there's a portion

00:28:15.010 --> 00:28:18.120
of the energy that
humans use that is related

00:28:18.120 --> 00:28:20.630
to individual behavior
and decision-making.

00:28:20.630 --> 00:28:23.920
What kind of car do you
drive, how big your house is,

00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:25.690
you know what you
define as comfort,

00:28:25.690 --> 00:28:30.310
is it a 2000 square foot
house or is it 4,000,

00:28:30.310 --> 00:28:32.660
but there's also a portion
of the energy that we use

00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:35.510
that is related to the
energy required to live

00:28:35.510 --> 00:28:38.470
within a certain
cultural context.

00:28:38.470 --> 00:28:41.320
When and how much people
use energy is dictated

00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:43.680
by the society in which we live

00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:45.730
and the routines
of that society.

00:28:45.730 --> 00:28:48.440
And this is really
important in the context

00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:50.690
of global energy policy
because there's a lot of savings

00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:55.040
that we can gain not just by
looking at individual incentives

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:57.450
like how much tax I'm
going to put on carbon

00:28:57.450 --> 00:29:00.510
or you know how much I'm
going to tax for an SUV,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:04.710
but looking at community
wide energy use.

00:29:04.710 --> 00:29:08.530
All right, so this is another
study where we conducted,

00:29:08.530 --> 00:29:11.760
where we looked at
the clustering

00:29:11.760 --> 00:29:15.780
of different voting districts
in Egypt during Ramadan.

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:18.460
And as you can see here,
this is before Ramadan,

00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.980
during Ramadan it peaks
during the [inaudible],

00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:23.780
the end of Ramadan
and again goes down.

00:29:23.780 --> 00:29:25.730
The difference between
these three groupings is

00:29:25.730 --> 00:29:27.600
that these are rich people,

00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.510
these are moderate you
know income people,

00:29:30.510 --> 00:29:33.350
and then these are
poor districts.

00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.600
So even within the same religion
energy is being used differently

00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:41.890
because some people have more
access to energy and services,

00:29:41.890 --> 00:29:43.750
this is an issue of inequality.

00:29:43.750 --> 00:29:47.400
This is also an issue of
religious backing because folks

00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:50.610
that are rich also
tend to be less pious,

00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:55.790
you know they don't follow
the full teachings of Islam.

00:29:55.790 --> 00:29:59.400
But what is common
across all of them is

00:29:59.400 --> 00:30:02.880
that everybody celebrates,
everybody must and is obligated

00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:04.950
to celebrate during
the [inaudible].,

00:30:04.950 --> 00:30:08.480
So, this is showing us
that we're really looking

00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:11.000
at cultural boundaries even
within the same culture.

00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:18.230
So that pretty well goes into
the holiday light feature

00:30:18.230 --> 00:30:20.600
and the last, thig
was two years ago.

00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.610
The last two years we've
been exploring other methods

00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:25.300
in which we can use
these measurements

00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.320
to also study humanity in new
ways, especially in the context

00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:31.540
of the United Nations
agenda of 2030

00:30:31.540 --> 00:30:33.350
for sustainable development
goals.

00:30:33.350 --> 00:30:36.190
And I'm going to go through
three different examples

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:39.770
where we are using these
measurements to assess some

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.270
of these sustainable development
goals, as we know them SDGs.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:47.650
So, this is goal seven, which is
to ensure access to affordable,

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:50.000
reliable, sustainable and
modern energy for all,

00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:55.600
which is bring electricity to
Africa, that's what it means.

00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:56.970
And what it means is also

00:30:56.970 --> 00:31:01.990
that by bringing electricity
we're also helping address some

00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:04.910
of the issues that we have
in terms of air quality,

00:31:04.910 --> 00:31:07.820
in terms of energy access
for children who can't study

00:31:07.820 --> 00:31:11.030
at night because they don't
have access to electricity,

00:31:11.030 --> 00:31:17.090
but especially on how we examine
routines for shifting energies

00:31:17.090 --> 00:31:18.390
to a more sustainable fashion.

00:31:18.390 --> 00:31:20.650
Because the way cooking is done

00:31:20.650 --> 00:31:24.830
in Africa really often times
relies on really dirty sources

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:30.810
of fuel like wood and carbon
and dung and you know byproducts

00:31:30.810 --> 00:31:32.710
from farmland and of course

00:31:32.710 --> 00:31:34.650
that causes [inaudible]
quality issues.

00:31:34.650 --> 00:31:39.580
And so, the point of the
goals is to be able to tackle

00:31:39.580 --> 00:31:43.430
and trace progress along
a number of indicators

00:31:43.430 --> 00:31:46.060
and in this case
looking at night lights

00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:48.990
to address how that
is being done.

00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:52.580
And so, here's the other issue
with energy is also we're trying

00:31:52.580 --> 00:31:55.240
to figure out how to
electrify an entire continent

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:57.400
and we haven't yet to
decide what's the proper mix

00:31:57.400 --> 00:32:01.410
between a centralized electrical
grid where power is coming

00:32:01.410 --> 00:32:05.500
in from a large turbine
and into small sectors.

00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.630
But in the case of
Africa powering

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.570
that last mile is really
hard and you really have

00:32:10.570 --> 00:32:14.350
to be off the grid and
use distributed systems.

00:32:14.350 --> 00:32:17.160
And so, here's an example of
how we can do, this is the city

00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:20.850
of Korhogo in Ivory
Coast and you can see

00:32:20.850 --> 00:32:23.360
that on a daily basis
we know the exact timing

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.210
of where the electrification
took place.

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:28.690
And we compare these with
records from the World Bank

00:32:28.690 --> 00:32:31.920
and the energy ministries
and we managed

00:32:31.920 --> 00:32:34.860
to find objectively
whether the programs

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.070
that are electrifying these
communities are working.

00:32:37.070 --> 00:32:40.980
If you're spending $400 million
a year on electrification most

00:32:40.980 --> 00:32:43.430
of it hopefully will
go to address the needs

00:32:43.430 --> 00:32:45.930
of these communities, some
of them will be wasted.

00:32:45.930 --> 00:32:49.990
And it's going to be in the
interest of everybody to ensure

00:32:49.990 --> 00:32:54.130
that we can effectively
assess progress.

00:32:54.130 --> 00:32:57.700
The same goes with what
happens when you're not looking

00:32:57.700 --> 00:33:00.330
at sustainability, but
also looking at resilience.

00:33:00.330 --> 00:33:02.990
Building a power
system that lasts

00:33:02.990 --> 00:33:05.550
through extreme weather
events and that's the case

00:33:05.550 --> 00:33:09.310
of Puerto Rico where we've
had, we've released maps

00:33:09.310 --> 00:33:14.410
that also show us the impacts
immediately following Maria.

00:33:14.410 --> 00:33:17.700
So, these are maps that we
released and we've been working

00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:20.910
with FEMA, the Army National
Guard and the Coast Guard,

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:25.330
we show the aftermath of Maria
and you'll see the slider coming

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:33.350
in now and this was
immediately three days after.

00:33:33.350 --> 00:33:37.040
And because we have these
long-term measurements we can't,

00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:38.540
we don't stop just at three days

00:33:38.540 --> 00:33:45.320
after we can keep looking
further and further

00:33:45.320 --> 00:33:50.570
into time 13 days
after, 17 days after.

00:33:50.570 --> 00:33:53.080
And because we're looking
at lighting we're looking

00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:55.400
at a different metric compared
to what is being reported

00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.430
by the government, which is
total power amount that's coming

00:33:59.430 --> 00:34:01.910
in from the transmission lines,

00:34:01.910 --> 00:34:03.330
which does not give
you any information

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:06.130
about who actually has
electricity right now.

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:10.130
And so, what we've been able to
do is to study outdoor lighting

00:34:10.130 --> 00:34:13.170
versus the percent number
of houses with electricity

00:34:13.170 --> 00:34:16.600
which again, it's only
the count of total amount

00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:18.780
of megawatt hours that
are being produced,

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:22.330
whether they are making it back
to the endpoint we don't know.

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:24.260
And what we argue
is that the residual

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.910
between these tell
you those folks

00:34:25.910 --> 00:34:28.390
who have diesel powered
generated

00:34:28.390 --> 00:34:31.950
because they're off the grid
and so you can start looking

00:34:31.950 --> 00:34:35.050
at energy access in a much
more broader wholistic way,

00:34:35.050 --> 00:34:36.620
not just looking at one system,

00:34:36.620 --> 00:34:39.910
but looking at the
entire system as a whole.

00:34:39.910 --> 00:34:43.140
The other thing that we also
can trace is inequality,

00:34:43.140 --> 00:34:46.580
especially in the context
of the modernization

00:34:46.580 --> 00:34:48.970
of the energy sector globally.

00:34:48.970 --> 00:34:52.360
Even after let's say like we
decide to spend $1 trillion

00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:55.790
in solar panels tomorrow we're
still going to have issues

00:34:55.790 --> 00:34:58.960
because we still have a path
dependence of communities

00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:04.340
which for ages, for generations
have only done this, mined coal

00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:06.710
and you don't have to go to
China you can just go two hours

00:35:06.710 --> 00:35:09.340
from here and you know
what I'm talking about.

00:35:09.340 --> 00:35:11.370
And the issue there
is that what happens

00:35:11.370 --> 00:35:12.780
when there's a policy enacted

00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.980
to lay off 1.2 million
Chinese workers in the district

00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:19.140
of Shenmu, well this
is what happens.

00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:22.020
It looks like a disaster, it
looks just like Puerto Rico.

00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.330
And there wasn't a disaster,

00:35:23.330 --> 00:35:26.110
the disaster really
is an economic trend

00:35:26.110 --> 00:35:29.110
of the urbanization
associated with a sector

00:35:29.110 --> 00:35:31.770
that has been wiped
out from the map.

00:35:31.770 --> 00:35:35.120
And humanity has gone
through these upswings many,

00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:37.010
many different times.

00:35:37.010 --> 00:35:40.550
We didn't you know evolve from
the Stone Age because we ran

00:35:40.550 --> 00:35:43.150
out of rocks we evolved
because --

00:35:43.150 --> 00:35:47.040
I know, it's because
we evolved from coal

00:35:47.040 --> 00:35:50.370
to more modernized means.

00:35:50.370 --> 00:35:53.040
So, we have to see this
as a positive but also,

00:35:53.040 --> 00:35:58.690
we need to see the energy
policy in a community context

00:35:58.690 --> 00:36:01.770
because there's people who
are being impacted as a result

00:36:01.770 --> 00:36:05.930
of these changes
in modernization.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:09.140
And finally, the other
thing I want to talk

00:36:09.140 --> 00:36:13.150
about is what happens you get
1.2 million coalminers showing

00:36:13.150 --> 00:36:17.390
up in all your cities looking
for jobs, that's what's going

00:36:17.390 --> 00:36:20.870
to happen, massive
migration of workers.

00:36:20.870 --> 00:36:22.710
And there is one place
where that happens

00:36:22.710 --> 00:36:24.810
and then suddenly
you get [inaudible],

00:36:24.810 --> 00:36:27.530
which in disaster
reduction we call, you know,

00:36:27.530 --> 00:36:29.650
you want to prevent
regional instability

00:36:29.650 --> 00:36:34.260
because that is going to
affect the central cities

00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:35.760
that drive the economy
of the country.

00:36:35.760 --> 00:36:37.060
And if there's one place

00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.390
where that has already
happened it's Syria.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:43.100
The issue of Syria has a lot,

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.380
I mean it's a very complicated
story, but the main issue

00:36:46.380 --> 00:36:51.890
that we see is that when the
energy sector when bust in 2008

00:36:51.890 --> 00:36:54.670
and all the fields, all
the winter wheat fields

00:36:54.670 --> 00:36:59.760
that were dependent on water
and pumps started to crash,

00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.210
you started seeing all these
farmers coming into the cities

00:37:02.210 --> 00:37:08.110
and that just created the right
recipe for ISIS to take over.

00:37:08.110 --> 00:37:13.150
And so, here's another,
we have video that we did

00:37:13.150 --> 00:37:15.970
with our colleagues at the BBC.

00:37:17.510 --> 00:38:09.510
[ Music ]

00:38:09.510 --> 00:38:36.500
[ Foreign Language ]

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:44.300
I'll show you a snapshot of
this one district in Aleppo

00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:50.280
and this is how it looks.

00:38:50.280 --> 00:38:52.840
And I've shown this to
economists and it's like you're

00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:54.700
like monitoring the
EKG of a city,

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:56.780
that's really what you're
doing you're monitoring,

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.910
I mean the buildings are
still there and destroyed.

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.550
But if the people aren't
there the next question is

00:39:01.550 --> 00:39:04.860
where are they going and
when are they coming back.

00:39:04.860 --> 00:39:08.870
And I can tell you where some
of them are going, they're going

00:39:08.870 --> 00:39:11.820
around different countries
and they're setting up shops

00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:14.400
in all these internally
displaced settlements.

00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:18.450
This is the largest
settlement in Jordan,

00:39:18.450 --> 00:39:24.960
the Zaatari Refugee Camp and
as you can see right in 2012,

00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:27.190
you know this town of
20,000 people needed

00:39:27.190 --> 00:39:30.720
to accommodate 200,000 refugees.

00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:36.450
And these are really tough
camps, there's no electricity

00:39:36.450 --> 00:39:40.170
and it's just tents,
thousands of them.

00:39:40.170 --> 00:39:41.750
And we can see that in the data

00:39:41.750 --> 00:39:46.130
because all these swings are
related to weather patterns

00:39:46.130 --> 00:39:48.730
where there's flooding,
constant flooding taking place

00:39:48.730 --> 00:39:50.640
and the relief workers
have a hard time bringing

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:51.940
in more people because they have

00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.500
to you know clean
up and bring back.

00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:58.050
The United Arab Emirates
contributed a new camp just 40

00:39:58.050 --> 00:40:01.130
kilometers away it's
called the Emirati camp

00:40:01.130 --> 00:40:03.890
and you can see these
are in containers,

00:40:03.890 --> 00:40:07.220
but they can only
accommodate up to 5,000 people.

00:40:07.220 --> 00:40:11.270
This is how it looks
from Google Earth.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:15.920
And of course, people are
coming back, this is the town

00:40:15.920 --> 00:40:20.710
of Jarabulus which was
taken over by El Shabab

00:40:20.710 --> 00:40:24.580
and the free Syrian
army was backed

00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:28.800
by the Turkish government
to take over in 2016.

00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:32.670
And this is what happens
when 20,000 people come back,

00:40:32.670 --> 00:40:38.160
so you can see this is the
Euphrates, so it's a pretty --

00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.740
it's right in the
corner where [inaudible],

00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:44.150
an area where ISIS cannot
really stay for a long time.

00:40:44.150 --> 00:40:48.160
All right, so this
is where we are

00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:53.710
with the black marble right now,
we have a massive amount of data

00:40:53.710 --> 00:40:55.740
and it's giving us
really rich information

00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:58.240
about the human condition.

00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:03.210
And it's helping us define our
communities not just as places

00:41:03.210 --> 00:41:06.920
that you put on a
map, but as a process.

00:41:06.920 --> 00:41:09.530
And it's allowing us
to study the confluence

00:41:09.530 --> 00:41:13.150
of the many different
challenges that humanity faces.

00:41:13.150 --> 00:41:16.130
When you look at climate change
it's not just about climate it's

00:41:16.130 --> 00:41:19.810
about urbanization, urban
development, it's about energy.

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:25.960
And to be able to ensure that
every community has a chance

00:41:25.960 --> 00:41:29.560
to improve their cities
in one way or another,

00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:33.810
no city in this country is
sustainable, is resilient,

00:41:33.810 --> 00:41:35.820
is equitable and safe.

00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:38.210
They may be three out of
four, they may be three,

00:41:38.210 --> 00:41:41.790
Vancouver is very pretty, but
it's still not sustainable

00:41:41.790 --> 00:41:43.650
because a lot of the materials
that they bring they bring

00:41:43.650 --> 00:41:46.950
from China, so they need
to account for materials

00:41:46.950 --> 00:41:48.700
and everything like that.

00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:51.980

00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.250
Well we don't save
lives, if I wanted to do

that I would be joining the army
[inaudible] in Puerto Rico now.

00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:01.890

with the data and the tools

00:42:01.890 --> 00:42:05.040
that they need in order
to tackle these problems,

00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:09.290
in order to push the
technology in a way

00:42:09.290 --> 00:42:10.900
that we can really turn this

00:42:10.900 --> 00:42:13.610
into societal benefit
for everyone.

Yeah, go ahead [inaudible].

00:42:38.500 --> 00:42:41.270
&gt;&gt; All right, so now that
you have the data created

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:43.440
or you're creating this
data who do you see

00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:47.730
as being the major
consumers of this data?

00:42:47.730 --> 00:42:50.260
&gt;&gt; Dr. Miguel Roman:
There are three consumers

00:42:50.260 --> 00:42:53.690
that we're targeting and we're
already collaborating with.

00:42:53.690 --> 00:42:58.000
One of them are economists and
demographers who are trying

00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:02.880
to study, who are trying to come
up with economics statistics

00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.520
in areas where there's
absolutely no data.

00:43:05.520 --> 00:43:09.330
Think, I mean we have so
much data on like labor rates

00:43:09.330 --> 00:43:10.840
and everything in the US

00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.790
that adding lights it
doesn't add more value,

00:43:12.790 --> 00:43:14.900
it doesn't improve
your statistics.

00:43:14.900 --> 00:43:18.560
But when you go into a place
like Ivory Coast, you know,

00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.830
having this information
really adds value in terms

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:22.730
of understanding trends,

00:43:22.730 --> 00:43:25.270
understanding demographic
changes, and doing it

00:43:25.270 --> 00:43:27.190
in a way that's new
not like doing

00:43:27.190 --> 00:43:30.510
like a census map every 10
years, but monitoring humanity

00:43:30.510 --> 00:43:32.840
in real time using social media

00:43:32.840 --> 00:43:35.130
and using a combination
of datasets.

00:43:35.130 --> 00:43:37.870
The second area is
disaster response,

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:40.400
FEMA already is obsessed
with this data.

00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:43.910
And they see it as a new
changing game technology nothing

00:43:43.910 --> 00:43:46.560
that they are using
operationally yet, but they want

00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.660
to get this in a more mature way

00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.980
so that they can get
measurements from anywhere

00:43:50.980 --> 00:43:53.250
in the United States, anywhere
in the world within three hours,

00:43:53.250 --> 00:43:55.220
so that's a separate community.

00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:58.910
And the third community of
course is the energy community.

00:43:58.910 --> 00:44:04.280
We want to be able to trust
and verify any efforts

00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:07.850
to restore power let's say
in Puerto Rico and to be able

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:10.140
to say wall there's
only three, you know,

00:44:10.140 --> 00:44:13.300
75% of people should have
power, so it should [inaudible],

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.390
so there's half actually.

00:44:15.390 --> 00:44:17.470
And to be able to
provide an objective means

00:44:17.470 --> 00:44:19.740
to track progress is
also very powerful.

00:44:19.740 --> 00:44:21.740
So those are the
three main ones.

00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.680
&gt;&gt; My question was if
you could please speak

00:44:27.410 --> 00:44:33.290
to your team how big it is and
the different kind of areas

00:44:33.290 --> 00:44:35.790

example on your team?

to my team, [inaudible] can you,

that's our team,
it's him and me.

does all the advertising

00:44:44.650 --> 00:44:47.100
and he's the mastermind behind
the black marble he does all

00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.400
the coding.

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.130
And there's Jessica [inaudible]
who's our coordinator

00:44:50.130 --> 00:44:51.430
for disaster.

00:44:51.430 --> 00:44:54.270
So, we also engage with all
different parts of members

00:44:54.270 --> 00:44:57.060
of the headquarters program
across different missions

00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.760
and we're hopefully
recruiting a new programmer,

00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:02.180
that's it that's our team.

00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:05.870
We have to do the science,
the data crunching,

00:45:05.870 --> 00:45:08.240
and we need to tell you a
story of why it matters.

00:45:08.240 --> 00:45:13.660
And we're lean and mean at NASA
because it's very competitive.

00:45:13.660 --> 00:45:16.410
All right, any other questions?

00:45:21.230 --> 00:45:29.830
&gt;&gt; Will this data
ever get compared

00:45:29.830 --> 00:45:33.040
with you know the other searches
for setting intelligent life?

00:45:33.040 --> 00:45:38.060
What you see in terms of
lights here ever be analyzed

00:45:38.060 --> 00:45:39.360
in a way that might be used?

00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:40.660
&gt;&gt; Dr. Miguel Roman: So, to
analyze let's say there's a --

00:45:40.660 --> 00:45:43.290
let's ponder if there's
going to be like a UFO

00:45:43.290 --> 00:45:46.950
and it's just going around
at night, can we detect that?

00:45:46.950 --> 00:45:48.900
Probably not because if
it's moving too fast,

00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:50.620
we actually had an
inactivation [inaudible] to see,

00:45:50.620 --> 00:45:53.020
to answer the question,
can you capture MH370,

00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.630
the Malaysian airliner
that was lost and was found

00:45:55.630 --> 00:45:58.260
in [inaudible] and
we were like honing

00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:01.450
over the entire Indian Ocean
trying to find the smallest area

00:46:01.450 --> 00:46:03.840
and we found a tiny little spot
it was like this must be it.

00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:06.120
But then our colleagues
have now confirmed

00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.110
that it was the condensation
of the trail of a meteor,

00:46:08.110 --> 00:46:10.720
I was like oh okay well at least
we can see a meteor that's fun.

00:46:10.720 --> 00:46:14.390
We can also see other satellites
going through because we're

00:46:14.390 --> 00:46:16.890
up at 833 kilometers, so once

00:46:16.890 --> 00:46:20.280
in a while there's a satellite
going behind us, on top of us

00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:21.940
and we're seeing a
satellite and it's like get

00:46:21.940 --> 00:46:24.350
out of the way I'm
measuring the earth.

00:46:24.350 --> 00:46:26.520
So, we can see things moving,

00:46:26.520 --> 00:46:29.220
well if that's alien
life I don't know.

00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:33.820
But yeah, we -- it was,
this sensor was not designed

00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:35.330
to measure holiday
lights from space,

00:46:35.330 --> 00:46:38.040
it's just that American
engineering is that good

00:46:38.040 --> 00:46:41.340
that we managed to get
that much sensitivity.

00:46:41.340 --> 00:46:42.960
But the program didn't
design this

00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:46.660
to do this you know that's how
NASA works it's like whoops,

00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.280
oh yeah you can measure
[inaudible] okay cool.

00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.660
But it's really, this is
a [inaudible] instrument

00:46:51.660 --> 00:46:55.280
that was designed to measure
extreme weather events in Alaska

00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.110
because we have geosynchronous
satellites and Alaska's right

00:46:59.110 --> 00:47:01.570
in the corner and they
don't have really good maps,

00:47:01.570 --> 00:47:04.830
so we came up with this night
vision map so that we can look

00:47:04.830 --> 00:47:08.680
at you know sea ice and
all these other aspects.

00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:11.010
And by accident NASA is also
having fun with the data

00:47:11.010 --> 00:47:13.840
and doing all this science,
but that's how it works.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:54.350
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:47:54.350 --> 00:47:58.770
So, if you see a lightning
strike we basically say we

00:47:58.770 --> 00:48:00.990
couldn't see anything that day

00:48:00.990 --> 00:48:03.570
because a lightning strike would
saturate that image to the point

00:48:03.570 --> 00:48:05.160
that it cannot be corrected.

00:48:05.160 --> 00:48:09.240
However, if it's aerosol we
can can use radiated transfer

00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:12.050
techniques, we can study,
looked at book of aerosols

00:48:12.050 --> 00:48:15.090
and study how much light
interacts with aerosols

00:48:15.090 --> 00:48:18.340
and we can really pin down the
uncertainty and the error there.

00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:19.970
If it's clouds probably
we're going

00:48:19.970 --> 00:48:22.140
to say we didn't detect
anything that day.

00:48:22.140 --> 00:48:23.560
And so, what we do is we go back

00:48:23.560 --> 00:48:26.370
to the clearest best data
possible and we report

00:48:26.370 --> 00:48:29.930
as this is not today, but
this is what we got yesterday.

00:48:29.930 --> 00:48:32.710
If that works for you
know for you that's fine.

00:48:32.710 --> 00:48:34.010
But if you're detecting
[inaudible] you want

00:48:34.010 --> 00:48:37.080
to have a clear shot, but that's
really hard over the Caribbean

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.380
where there's so many clouds.

00:48:38.380 --> 00:48:40.620
So, you have to really
build your confidence

00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.040
and that's the uniqueness of
having a polar orbiting sensor

00:48:43.040 --> 00:48:46.210
where you're visiting
Puerto Rico every night

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:51.190
and you can really build a large
record over time to really ramp

00:48:51.190 --> 00:48:53.000
down the uncertainties.

00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.930
So, depending on the
phenomenon sometimes we give up

00:48:56.930 --> 00:49:00.770
and sometimes we say actually
we can, let's use these models

00:49:00.770 --> 00:49:03.590
to then describe what is
actually being seen that's only

00:49:03.590 --> 00:49:05.390
human driven.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:12.040
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:49:12.040 --> 00:49:13.730
Yes.

00:49:13.730 --> 00:49:16.110
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:49:16.110 --> 00:49:21.770
Yes, roughly 40 to 60% of
light will actually pass

00:49:21.770 --> 00:49:23.920
through aerosols
depending on the sphericity

00:49:23.920 --> 00:49:26.340
and the size distribution
of that aerosol.

00:49:26.340 --> 00:49:29.580
It could be dust from the
Sahara, it could be fire

00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:33.010
and smoke and because we
have daytime measurements

00:49:33.010 --> 00:49:36.970
that really accurately measure
those particles we make some

00:49:36.970 --> 00:49:38.970
assumptions of what happens
between the day and night,

00:49:38.970 --> 00:49:41.020
about the photochemistry
because everything is changing

00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:43.040
at night when the sun is out.

00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:45.180
And [inaudible] and
I have built models

00:49:45.180 --> 00:49:49.010
to really constrain
the errors there.

00:49:49.010 --> 00:49:51.310
It's a big problem and
we're really starting

00:49:51.310 --> 00:49:53.790
to really explore aerosol
retrievals at night,

00:49:53.790 --> 00:49:56.440
so yeah that's for like
the next generation.

00:49:56.440 --> 00:49:58.470
&gt;&gt; Does the Department of
Defense have any interest

00:49:58.470 --> 00:50:04.250
in looking at say North
Korea [inaudible]?

00:50:04.250 --> 00:50:05.550
&gt;&gt; Dr. Miguel Roman:
The Department

00:50:05.550 --> 00:50:07.730
of Defense likely has
an even much broader

00:50:07.730 --> 00:50:09.940
and more refined
measurement than these

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:13.480
where they can even get an
even finer resolution directly.

00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:18.720
I think the Air Force and
Weather Agency also has a lot

00:50:18.720 --> 00:50:21.220
of interest because this
phenomenon where you have

00:50:21.220 --> 00:50:24.610
to secure an accurate
forecast when troops are going

00:50:24.610 --> 00:50:26.400
through oceans and everything.

00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.380
So yeah there -- and in fact
the first-generation nighttime

00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:35.310
sensor was from the DOD, so
this is a DOD heritage sensor.

00:50:35.310 --> 00:50:38.520
And I think you had one more.

00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:40.920
&gt;&gt; In terms of energy
consumption,

00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:47.680
will there come a time when
the increasing use of LEDs

00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:50.320
or other much more
energy efficient sources

00:50:50.320 --> 00:50:55.800
of light impact on how you
have to deal with this data

00:50:55.800 --> 00:50:58.780
and you know in the near future
is that like [inaudible]?

00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:01.220
&gt;&gt; Dr. Miguel Roman: So, there's
two issues with LEDs and one

00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:06.740
of them is that the eyes of the
sensor that measures the earth

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:11.000
at night they can't see blue and
LEDs have a lot of blue on them.

00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:12.860
You may not see it,
but they combine a lot

00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:15.270
of blue [inaudible] because
then you'll saturate.

00:51:15.270 --> 00:51:18.460
And so, if you look
at the wavelength

00:51:18.460 --> 00:51:24.380
in the [inaudible] spectrum
blue is high at 480 nanometers,

00:51:24.380 --> 00:51:28.310
this sensor's shortest
wavelength is 500

00:51:28.310 --> 00:51:31.640
which is green, meaning
that we can't detect LEDs.

00:51:31.640 --> 00:51:35.400
But LEDs also have a lot of
information in the green,

00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:38.280
in the red, but most -- there's
a huge [inaudible] in the blue

00:51:38.280 --> 00:51:39.580
that we cannot detect.

00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.320
So, meaning that
from year-to-year

00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:45.590
if someone switches lights using
this sensor we cannot detect an

00:51:45.590 --> 00:51:46.910
LED change.

00:51:46.910 --> 00:51:50.110
What we can detect
is improved methods

00:51:50.110 --> 00:51:51.820
for abatement of
light pollution.

00:51:51.820 --> 00:51:55.870
So, if you use a full cutoff
light instead of putting

00:51:55.870 --> 00:51:59.740
like contaminating the night
sky which you know messes

00:51:59.740 --> 00:52:03.590
up all the astronomy and
messes up like bird habitats,

00:52:03.590 --> 00:52:05.410
then we can detect that change

00:52:05.410 --> 00:52:07.550
because now you're concentrating
the light to the surface

00:52:07.550 --> 00:52:09.790
and so you're going to
see a downward trend.

00:52:09.790 --> 00:52:13.250
But unless you give me $200
million and I put another sensor

00:52:13.250 --> 00:52:14.880
in the international
space station,

00:52:14.880 --> 00:52:18.490
which we could do we
can't detect the LEDs,

00:52:18.490 --> 00:52:20.950
it's a really small signal.

00:52:24.510 --> 00:52:44.060
[ Inaudible Comment ]

00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:50.890
In fact, yes in fact, if you
use the only and the records

00:52:50.890 --> 00:52:56.280
from the early 1990's
we're already seeing

00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:59.790
which is good news that
an overall negative trend

00:52:59.790 --> 00:53:03.370
in short-lived gases
across the United States,

00:53:03.370 --> 00:53:06.120
especially in California a lot
of smog has finally started

00:53:06.120 --> 00:53:09.060
to ramp down, but it's also
an issue of mountain metrology

00:53:09.060 --> 00:53:11.510
and all these other
issues associated with it.

00:53:11.510 --> 00:53:15.100
And so yeah, we can
detect long-term trends

00:53:15.100 --> 00:53:18.900
and as we add more
instruments that measure ozone,

00:53:18.900 --> 00:53:23.650
that measure plumes we can also
start characterizing aerosols

00:53:23.650 --> 00:53:25.060
for very long periods of time.

00:53:25.060 --> 00:53:30.290
The value that nighttime images
provide in that context is

00:53:30.290 --> 00:53:32.740
that we can measure
optical properties at night,

00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:34.410
which no other sensor can do.

00:53:34.410 --> 00:53:38.580
And oftentimes you just rely on
the thermal data to detect fires

00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:42.480
and clouds, but finally we can
also detect optical properties

00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:45.700
and that means that we can
build a more complete record

00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:47.130
because oftentimes
you get clouds

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:48.930
and then suddenly you need
to look at the interaction

00:53:48.930 --> 00:53:52.100
between clouds and aerosols
and that becomes difficult.

00:53:52.100 --> 00:53:56.990
And so, and this is very
early work that's started

00:53:56.990 --> 00:53:59.090
at NASA [inaudible].

00:53:59.090 --> 00:54:01.320
And usually you need
like a 30, 40-year record

00:54:01.320 --> 00:54:04.090
to really start seeing a trend
and this is just five years,

00:54:04.090 --> 00:54:05.390
so I'll make that clear.

00:54:05.390 --> 00:54:08.540
But you can start seeing
a lot of typologies,

00:54:08.540 --> 00:54:11.750
you start seeing cities
grow and everything.

00:54:11.750 --> 00:54:13.480
All right.
