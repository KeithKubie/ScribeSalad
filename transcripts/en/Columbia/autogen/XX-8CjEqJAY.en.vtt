00:00:55.610 --> 00:01:01.670
now let's just do it okay this aluminum

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:01.680
now let's just do it okay this aluminum
 

00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.619
now let's just do it okay this aluminum
strip is the specimen that's going to

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
strip is the specimen that's going to
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.390

have some strain gauges mounted to it

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:05.400
have some strain gauges mounted to it
 

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.580
have some strain gauges mounted to it
and you'll notice there's a hole on one

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:07.590
and you'll notice there's a hole on one
 

00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:10.580
and you'll notice there's a hole on one
side that's to hang away from the other

00:01:10.580 --> 00:01:10.590
side that's to hang away from the other
 

00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:13.039
side that's to hang away from the other
side will get clamped to a tabletop with

00:01:13.039 --> 00:01:13.049
side will get clamped to a tabletop with
 

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:16.429
side will get clamped to a tabletop with
a c-clamp sort of right here so we would

00:01:16.429 --> 00:01:16.439
a c-clamp sort of right here so we would
 

00:01:16.439 --> 00:01:18.140
a c-clamp sort of right here so we would
like to mount the strain gauges

00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:18.150
like to mount the strain gauges
 

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:20.570
like to mount the strain gauges
somewhere around here and there's going

00:01:20.570 --> 00:01:20.580
somewhere around here and there's going
 

00:01:20.580 --> 00:01:23.030
somewhere around here and there's going
to be one mounted on one side and one

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:23.040
to be one mounted on one side and one
 

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:27.070
to be one mounted on one side and one
on the other side so I will just sort of

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:27.080
on the other side so I will just sort of
 

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.200
on the other side so I will just sort of
very roughly mark out the area somewhere

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:30.210
very roughly mark out the area somewhere
 

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.450
very roughly mark out the area somewhere
in that area is going to be where we put

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:32.460
in that area is going to be where we put
 

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:43.020
in that area is going to be where we put
the strain gauge

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:43.030
 

00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:46.080
run continuous yeah you have plans right

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:46.090
run continuous yeah you have plans right
 

00:01:46.090 --> 00:01:48.719
run continuous yeah you have plans right

out ok the first procedure as has

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.490
out ok the first procedure as has
 

00:01:54.490 --> 00:01:57.600
out ok the first procedure as has
pointed out in this manual which has

00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:57.610
pointed out in this manual which has
 

00:01:57.610 --> 00:02:02.940
pointed out in this manual which has
been scanned in put on Whitney these are

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:02.950
been scanned in put on Whitney these are
 

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.350
been scanned in put on Whitney these are
the instructions on how to mount the

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:04.360
the instructions on how to mount the
 

00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:06.270
the instructions on how to mount the
strain gauges the first thing you need

00:02:06.270 --> 00:02:06.280
strain gauges the first thing you need
 

00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:11.610
strain gauges the first thing you need
to do is decrease the sample now we're

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:11.620
to do is decrease the sample now we're
 

00:02:11.620 --> 00:02:14.670
to do is decrease the sample now we're
using isopropyl alcohol as our degreaser

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
using isopropyl alcohol as our degreaser
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.610
using isopropyl alcohol as our degreaser
because it's a very safe chemical to

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:17.620
because it's a very safe chemical to
 

00:02:17.620 --> 00:02:20.580
because it's a very safe chemical to
work with acetone might work better but

00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:20.590
work with acetone might work better but
 

00:02:20.590 --> 00:02:23.310
work with acetone might work better but
we have found that the alcohol works

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.320
we have found that the alcohol works
 

00:02:23.320 --> 00:02:32.230
we have found that the alcohol works
fine

00:02:32.230 --> 00:02:32.240
 

00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:34.600
it's important to keep the material

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610
it's important to keep the material
 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:41.440
it's important to keep the material
extremely clean so once you clean it off

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.450
extremely clean so once you clean it off
 

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:43.750
extremely clean so once you clean it off
don't touch it with your fingers your

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
don't touch it with your fingers your
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.420
don't touch it with your fingers your
fingers will leave residual grease

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:46.430
fingers will leave residual grease
 

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:49.930
fingers will leave residual grease
behind and that could play a little

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:49.940
behind and that could play a little
 

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.760
behind and that could play a little
riegelwood havoc on the strain gauge

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:51.770
riegelwood havoc on the strain gauge

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:04.280
the next process is to use the NFF

00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:04.290
the next process is to use the NFF

conditioner a which is in the jar that
 

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.750
conditioner a which is in the jar that
has the red the red top and we are going

00:03:11.750 --> 00:03:11.760
has the red the red top and we are going
 

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:14.809
has the red the red top and we are going
to surface a braid so I'm just putting a

00:03:14.809 --> 00:03:14.819
to surface a braid so I'm just putting a
 

00:03:14.819 --> 00:03:17.809
to surface a braid so I'm just putting a
drop or two of the Empress condition hey

00:03:17.809 --> 00:03:17.819
drop or two of the Empress condition hey
 

00:03:17.819 --> 00:03:20.449
drop or two of the Empress condition hey
onto the sample and then with a little

00:03:20.449 --> 00:03:20.459
onto the sample and then with a little
 

00:03:20.459 --> 00:03:23.690
onto the sample and then with a little
bit of this sandpaper you're just going

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:23.700
bit of this sandpaper you're just going
 

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:27.949
bit of this sandpaper you're just going
to rough up the surface and this again

00:03:27.949 --> 00:03:27.959
to rough up the surface and this again
 

00:03:27.959 --> 00:03:32.520
to rough up the surface and this again
is all due to solve for

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:32.530
is all due to solve for
 

00:03:32.530 --> 00:03:35.050
is all due to solve for
better adhesion of the strain gauge

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.060

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:53.790
after you have rated it a bit sure you

00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:53.800
after you have rated it a bit sure you
 

00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:59.820
after you have rated it a bit sure you
wipe the surface clean and they also

00:03:59.820 --> 00:03:59.830
wipe the surface clean and they also
 

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:03.330
wipe the surface clean and they also
tell you to not don't wipe it twice with

everything as soon as you can
 

00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:15.110
everything as soon as you can
now we're going to just lay out the area

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
now we're going to just lay out the area
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.240
now we're going to just lay out the area
of where we want the strain gauge

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
of where we want the strain gauge
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:22.039

mounted now since a c-clamp will go here

00:04:22.039 --> 00:04:22.049
mounted now since a c-clamp will go here
 

00:04:22.049 --> 00:04:25.340
mounted now since a c-clamp will go here
I'm going to mount it somewhat up here I

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:25.350
I'm going to mount it somewhat up here I
 

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.060
I'm going to mount it somewhat up here I
want it right in the center if possible

00:04:28.060 --> 00:04:28.070
want it right in the center if possible
 

00:04:28.070 --> 00:04:32.600
want it right in the center if possible
so here the sample is exactly an inch so

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:32.610
so here the sample is exactly an inch so
 

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:36.260
so here the sample is exactly an inch so
I'm going to lay out the small pencil

00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:36.270
I'm going to lay out the small pencil
 

00:04:36.270 --> 00:04:40.430
I'm going to lay out the small pencil
line at the half inch mark

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:40.440
line at the half inch mark
 

00:04:40.440 --> 00:04:46.340
line at the half inch mark
and where I put it in terms of from the

have enough room to clamp it so i will

00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:51.410
have enough room to clamp it so i will
 

00:04:51.410 --> 00:04:55.190
have enough room to clamp it so i will
somewhat arbitrarily just gonna just put

00:04:55.190 --> 00:04:55.200
somewhat arbitrarily just gonna just put
 

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:59.090
somewhat arbitrarily just gonna just put
it somewhere around here

00:04:59.090 --> 00:04:59.100
 

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:03.330
after we market instructions ask you to

with these cotton swabs and again this

00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:10.060
with these cotton swabs and again this
 

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:13.830
with these cotton swabs and again this
is just to get any residue out of the

is just to get any residue out of the
 

00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:36.850
is just to get any residue out of the
area where we're going to mount the gage

00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:36.860
 

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:41.060
so after we have mounted or after we

00:05:41.060 --> 00:05:41.070
so after we have mounted or after we
 

00:05:41.070 --> 00:05:44.860
so after we have mounted or after we
have used the N prep conditioner a

00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:44.870
have used the N prep conditioner a
 

00:05:44.870 --> 00:05:48.020
have used the N prep conditioner a
thanks the entire surface now needs to

00:05:48.020 --> 00:05:48.030
thanks the entire surface now needs to
 

00:05:48.030 --> 00:05:50.660
thanks the entire surface now needs to
be neutralized using the M prep

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:50.670
be neutralized using the M prep

00:05:59.070 --> 00:06:03.940
top and again we'll just drip a few
drops and

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:03.950
 

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:19.559
we'll get those up with the Primus Mars

00:06:19.559 --> 00:06:19.569
 

00:06:19.569 --> 00:06:30.499

00:06:30.499 --> 00:06:30.509
 

00:06:30.509 --> 00:06:33.899
ok here are in here is a package of

00:06:33.899 --> 00:06:33.909
ok here are in here is a package of
 

00:06:33.909 --> 00:06:36.809

strain gauges some of them have been

00:06:39.269 --> 00:06:39.279
strain gauges some of them have been
 

00:06:39.279 --> 00:06:41.459
strain gauges some of them have been
used previously so I should also mention

00:06:41.459 --> 00:06:41.469
used previously so I should also mention
 

00:06:41.469 --> 00:06:43.469
used previously so I should also mention
the back of the this is somewhat

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:43.479
the back of the this is somewhat
 

00:06:43.479 --> 00:06:45.509
the back of the this is somewhat
important on the back of the strain

00:06:45.509 --> 00:06:45.519
important on the back of the strain
 

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:48.869
important on the back of the strain
gauge envelope are some important

00:06:48.869 --> 00:06:48.879
gauge envelope are some important
 

00:06:48.879 --> 00:06:52.709

has a 2.1 gauge factor and that will
 

00:06:58.389 --> 00:07:02.489
has a 2.1 gauge factor and that will
play into setting up the instrumentation

00:07:02.489 --> 00:07:02.499
play into setting up the instrumentation
 

00:07:02.499 --> 00:07:05.549
play into setting up the instrumentation
and getting the correct reading so nope

00:07:05.549 --> 00:07:05.559
and getting the correct reading so nope

your gauge factor now these as you could

00:07:11.399 --> 00:07:11.409
your gauge factor now these as you could
 

00:07:11.409 --> 00:07:14.699
your gauge factor now these as you could
imagine these strain gauges are made in

00:07:14.699 --> 00:07:14.709
imagine these strain gauges are made in
 

00:07:14.709 --> 00:07:16.829
imagine these strain gauges are made in
a very clean environment and they must

00:07:16.829 --> 00:07:16.839
a very clean environment and they must
 

00:07:16.839 --> 00:07:20.100
a very clean environment and they must
be kept very clean and uncontaminated so

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:20.110
be kept very clean and uncontaminated so
 

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:21.989
be kept very clean and uncontaminated so
they're really sealed in this packet

00:07:21.989 --> 00:07:21.999
they're really sealed in this packet
 

00:07:21.999 --> 00:07:27.479
they're really sealed in this packet
each one is in a little plastic folded

00:07:27.479 --> 00:07:27.489
each one is in a little plastic folded
 

00:07:27.489 --> 00:07:31.290
each one is in a little plastic folded
up a pizza plastic and whenever you're

00:07:31.290 --> 00:07:31.300
up a pizza plastic and whenever you're
 

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:34.259
up a pizza plastic and whenever you're
working with these you should pretend

00:07:34.259 --> 00:07:34.269
working with these you should pretend
 

00:07:34.269 --> 00:07:36.480
working with these you should pretend
you're a surgeon working in a very clean

00:07:36.480 --> 00:07:36.490
you're a surgeon working in a very clean
 

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:41.820
you're a surgeon working in a very clean
environment now I'm going to spread this

00:07:41.820 --> 00:07:41.830
 

00:07:41.830 --> 00:07:49.190
open

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:49.200
 

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.500
I want to point out because i have seen

00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:51.510
I want to point out because i have seen
 

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:54.170
I want to point out because i have seen
students do this even though it might

00:07:54.170 --> 00:07:54.180
students do this even though it might
 

00:07:54.180 --> 00:07:57.260
students do this even though it might
seem a little weird but there there's a

00:07:57.260 --> 00:07:57.270
seem a little weird but there there's a
 

00:07:57.270 --> 00:07:59.510
seem a little weird but there there's a
front side on a back side to the strain

00:07:59.510 --> 00:07:59.520
front side on a back side to the strain
 

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:03.439

gauge

00:08:03.439 --> 00:08:03.449
 

00:08:03.449 --> 00:08:09.629
lift it out with this these tweezers

00:08:09.629 --> 00:08:09.639
 

00:08:09.639 --> 00:08:16.279
these are delicate little devices but so

00:08:16.279 --> 00:08:16.289
 

00:08:16.289 --> 00:08:18.959
this is a strain gauge the back of the

00:08:18.959 --> 00:08:18.969
this is a strain gauge the back of the
 

00:08:18.969 --> 00:08:22.429
this is a strain gauge the back of the
strain gauge is very dull looking and

00:08:22.429 --> 00:08:22.439
strain gauge is very dull looking and
 

00:08:22.439 --> 00:08:25.200
strain gauge is very dull looking and
it's this side that we're going to mount

00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:25.210
it's this side that we're going to mount
 

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:27.450
it's this side that we're going to mount
on to the sample I've seen students glue

00:08:27.450 --> 00:08:27.460
on to the sample I've seen students glue
 

00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.339
on to the sample I've seen students glue
these on backwards and then you can't

00:08:29.339 --> 00:08:29.349
these on backwards and then you can't
 

00:08:29.349 --> 00:08:30.929
these on backwards and then you can't
solder to them because you see there's

00:08:30.929 --> 00:08:30.939
solder to them because you see there's
 

00:08:30.939 --> 00:08:33.060
solder to them because you see there's
two nice little tabs to solder wires

00:08:33.060 --> 00:08:33.070
two nice little tabs to solder wires
 

00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.850
two nice little tabs to solder wires
onto but if you mount it upside down not

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:35.860
onto but if you mount it upside down not
 

00:08:35.860 --> 00:08:40.050
onto but if you mount it upside down not
going to be able to do it now I'm

00:08:40.050 --> 00:08:40.060
going to be able to do it now I'm
 

00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:42.449
going to be able to do it now I'm
putting it back in the little plastic

00:08:42.449 --> 00:08:42.459
putting it back in the little plastic
 

00:08:42.459 --> 00:08:46.650
putting it back in the little plastic
that it came with and I'm going to pull

00:08:46.650 --> 00:08:46.660
that it came with and I'm going to pull
 

00:08:46.660 --> 00:08:50.699
that it came with and I'm going to pull
some of this tape okay so I have the

00:08:50.699 --> 00:08:50.709
some of this tape okay so I have the
 

00:08:50.709 --> 00:08:53.850
some of this tape okay so I have the
tape on here still and I'm now going to

00:08:53.850 --> 00:08:53.860
tape on here still and I'm now going to
 

00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.170
tape on here still and I'm now going to
peel the tape back and as I peel the

00:08:58.170 --> 00:08:58.180
peel the tape back and as I peel the
 

00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:00.389
peel the tape back and as I peel the
tape back see if we can capture this

00:09:00.389 --> 00:09:00.399
tape back see if we can capture this
 

00:09:00.399 --> 00:09:03.210
tape back see if we can capture this
with the camera the strain gauge is

00:09:03.210 --> 00:09:03.220
with the camera the strain gauge is
 

00:09:03.220 --> 00:09:05.160
with the camera the strain gauge is
going to come with it which is exactly

00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:05.170
going to come with it which is exactly
 

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:11.150
going to come with it which is exactly
what you want to happen and

00:09:11.150 --> 00:09:11.160
 

00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.240
and see if I can just uncurl this do not

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.250
and see if I can just uncurl this do not
 

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:15.920
and see if I can just uncurl this do not
touch the back side of the strain gauge

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:15.930
touch the back side of the strain gauge
 

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:18.800
touch the back side of the strain gauge
because it has an absolutely christine

00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:18.810
because it has an absolutely christine
 

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:21.619
because it has an absolutely christine
clean surface and we want to keep it as

00:09:21.619 --> 00:09:21.629
clean surface and we want to keep it as
 

00:09:21.629 --> 00:09:23.509
clean surface and we want to keep it as
clean as we can we definitely don't do

00:09:23.509 --> 00:09:23.519
clean as we can we definitely don't do
 

00:09:23.519 --> 00:09:25.639
clean as we can we definitely don't do
not want any dust or any particulate

00:09:25.639 --> 00:09:25.649
not want any dust or any particulate
 

00:09:25.649 --> 00:09:27.280
not want any dust or any particulate
matter to get behind the strain gauge

00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:27.290
matter to get behind the strain gauge
 

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.840

I'm now going to place the strain gauge

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:29.850
I'm now going to place the strain gauge
 

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.749
I'm now going to place the strain gauge
where I want it to be mounted I can

00:09:32.749 --> 00:09:32.759
where I want it to be mounted I can
 

00:09:32.759 --> 00:09:36.230
where I want it to be mounted I can
still see my pencil line and try to

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:36.240
still see my pencil line and try to
 

00:09:36.240 --> 00:09:38.509
still see my pencil line and try to
mount the strain gauge as straight as

00:09:38.509 --> 00:09:38.519
mount the strain gauge as straight as
 

00:09:38.519 --> 00:09:44.769
mount the strain gauge as straight as
you can on to the sample okay now maybe

00:09:44.769 --> 00:09:44.779
you can on to the sample okay now maybe
 

00:09:44.779 --> 00:09:47.480
you can on to the sample okay now maybe
see if I can bring this a little closer

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:47.490
see if I can bring this a little closer
 

00:09:47.490 --> 00:09:50.030
see if I can bring this a little closer
to the camera so that's basically what

00:09:50.030 --> 00:09:50.040
to the camera so that's basically what
 

00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:58.380
to the camera so that's basically what
you want to do now

00:09:58.380 --> 00:09:58.390
 

00:09:58.390 --> 00:10:03.630
the next thing to do is to make sure the

00:10:03.630 --> 00:10:03.640
the next thing to do is to make sure the
 

00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.640
the next thing to do is to make sure the
upper part of the tape is really well

00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:05.650
upper part of the tape is really well
 

00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:08.670
upper part of the tape is really well
adhered to the sample and what we're

00:10:08.670 --> 00:10:08.680
adhered to the sample and what we're
 

00:10:08.680 --> 00:10:11.130
adhered to the sample and what we're
going to do next is we're going to peel

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:11.140
going to do next is we're going to peel
 

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:17.250
going to do next is we're going to peel
back the sample peel back the tape and

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.260
back the sample peel back the tape and
 

00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.800
back the sample peel back the tape and
we're exposing the strain gauge again

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:21.810
we're exposing the strain gauge again
 

00:10:21.810 --> 00:10:25.740
we're exposing the strain gauge again
again do not touch it do not put any

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.750
again do not touch it do not put any
 

00:10:25.750 --> 00:10:29.340
again do not touch it do not put any
dust or particles near it now the next

00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:29.350
dust or particles near it now the next
 

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.020
dust or particles near it now the next
thing we're going to do is we're taking

00:10:31.020 --> 00:10:31.030
thing we're going to do is we're taking
 

00:10:31.030 --> 00:10:36.180
thing we're going to do is we're taking
out the M bond 200 strain gauge glue now

00:10:36.180 --> 00:10:36.190
out the M bond 200 strain gauge glue now
 

00:10:36.190 --> 00:10:38.520
out the M bond 200 strain gauge glue now
a lot of the glues have expiration dates

00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:38.530
a lot of the glues have expiration dates
 

00:10:38.530 --> 00:10:43.440
a lot of the glues have expiration dates
on them these dates are sort of ballpark

00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:43.450
on them these dates are sort of ballpark
 

00:10:43.450 --> 00:10:46.830
on them these dates are sort of ballpark
dates if you're doing serious testing

00:10:46.830 --> 00:10:46.840
dates if you're doing serious testing
 

00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:49.350
dates if you're doing serious testing
for an outside agency and you have to

00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:49.360
for an outside agency and you have to
 

00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:51.900
for an outside agency and you have to
swear by the results then it would be

00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:51.910
swear by the results then it would be
 

00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:54.030
swear by the results then it would be
inappropriate to use this after the

00:10:54.030 --> 00:10:54.040
inappropriate to use this after the
 

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.940
inappropriate to use this after the
expiration date but for our purposes in

00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:56.950
expiration date but for our purposes in
 

00:10:56.950 --> 00:10:59.940
expiration date but for our purposes in
the lab if it's expired by a little bit

00:10:59.940 --> 00:10:59.950
the lab if it's expired by a little bit
 

00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:02.460
the lab if it's expired by a little bit
it's not that important just as long as

00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:02.470
it's not that important just as long as
 

00:11:02.470 --> 00:11:04.740
it's not that important just as long as
the stuff still works really now there

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:04.750
the stuff still works really now there
 

00:11:04.750 --> 00:11:06.900
the stuff still works really now there
are two bottles in here one is a

00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:06.910
are two bottles in here one is a
 

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:11.370
are two bottles in here one is a
catalyst this super cool bluish liquid

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:11.380
catalyst this super cool bluish liquid
 

00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:13.890
catalyst this super cool bluish liquid
and this other bottle contains what

00:11:13.890 --> 00:11:13.900
and this other bottle contains what
 

00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:17.580
and this other bottle contains what
basically is crazy glue okay it's a CA

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:17.590
basically is crazy glue okay it's a CA
 

00:11:17.590 --> 00:11:22.230
basically is crazy glue okay it's a CA
cement so what we have to do next is we

00:11:22.230 --> 00:11:22.240
cement so what we have to do next is we
 

00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:24.660
cement so what we have to do next is we
take the catalyst out and you're

00:11:24.660 --> 00:11:24.670
take the catalyst out and you're
 

00:11:24.670 --> 00:11:29.030
take the catalyst out and you're
supposed to rush it like 20 times

00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:29.040
supposed to rush it like 20 times
 

00:11:29.040 --> 00:11:33.350
supposed to rush it like 20 times
on the rim of the jar to basically make

00:11:33.350 --> 00:11:33.360
on the rim of the jar to basically make
 

00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.480
on the rim of the jar to basically make
sure there's virtually no cattle is left

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:35.490
sure there's virtually no cattle is left
 

00:11:35.490 --> 00:11:38.180
sure there's virtually no cattle is left
on the brush just a little bit and then

00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:38.190
on the brush just a little bit and then
 

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:40.999
on the brush just a little bit and then
I'm going to come over here and I'm

00:11:40.999 --> 00:11:41.009
I'm going to come over here and I'm
 

00:11:41.009 --> 00:11:46.420
I'm going to come over here and I'm
going to

00:11:46.420 --> 00:11:46.430
 

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.010
it's really just remnants of the

00:11:48.010 --> 00:11:48.020
it's really just remnants of the
 

00:11:48.020 --> 00:11:49.680
it's really just remnants of the
catalyst left

00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:49.690
catalyst left
 

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:53.520

I'm going to just make sure little

00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:53.530
I'm going to just make sure little
 

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:55.470
I'm going to just make sure little
catalyst is applied to the back side of

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:55.480
catalyst is applied to the back side of
 

00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:58.440
catalyst is applied to the back side of
that strain gauge and then they tell you

00:11:58.440 --> 00:11:58.450
that strain gauge and then they tell you
 

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.980
that strain gauge and then they tell you
to wait I believe a minute and then we

00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:01.990
to wait I believe a minute and then we
 

00:12:01.990 --> 00:12:12.600
to wait I believe a minute and then we
will apply the m bond 200 okay now once

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:12.610
will apply the m bond 200 okay now once
 

00:12:12.610 --> 00:12:14.850
will apply the m bond 200 okay now once
this glue has sufficiently dried which

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:14.860
this glue has sufficiently dried which
 

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:16.380
this glue has sufficiently dried which
is probably about two or three minutes

00:12:16.380 --> 00:12:16.390
is probably about two or three minutes
 

00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.160
is probably about two or three minutes
if if all goes well when we peel off

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.170
if if all goes well when we peel off
 

00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:22.770
if if all goes well when we peel off
this tape the strain gauge will be glued

00:12:22.770 --> 00:12:22.780
this tape the strain gauge will be glued
 

00:12:22.780 --> 00:12:25.590
this tape the strain gauge will be glued
down I recommend keeping the tape upping

00:12:25.590 --> 00:12:25.600
down I recommend keeping the tape upping
 

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.540
down I recommend keeping the tape upping
like peel off the tape the way I'm doing

00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:27.550
like peel off the tape the way I'm doing
 

00:12:27.550 --> 00:12:30.180
like peel off the tape the way I'm doing
it rather than pull it up I think it's

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:30.190
it rather than pull it up I think it's
 

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:32.760
it rather than pull it up I think it's
more likely to keep the strain gauge in

00:12:32.760 --> 00:12:32.770
more likely to keep the strain gauge in
 

00:12:32.770 --> 00:12:37.650
more likely to keep the strain gauge in
its place and I have seen these for

00:12:37.650 --> 00:12:37.660
its place and I have seen these for
 

00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:39.960
its place and I have seen these for
reasons I do not know i have seen the

00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:39.970
reasons I do not know i have seen the
 

00:12:39.970 --> 00:12:42.360
reasons I do not know i have seen the
strain gauges fail to adhere to the

00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:42.370
strain gauges fail to adhere to the
 

00:12:42.370 --> 00:12:45.060
strain gauges fail to adhere to the
material so if in fact when you peel off

00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:45.070
material so if in fact when you peel off
 

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.340
material so if in fact when you peel off
the tape the strain gauge comes with it

00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:47.350
the tape the strain gauge comes with it
 

00:12:47.350 --> 00:12:49.110
the tape the strain gauge comes with it
then you just have to start completely

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:49.120
then you just have to start completely
 

00:12:49.120 --> 00:12:51.120
then you just have to start completely
from scratch the strain gauge is no good

00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:51.130
from scratch the strain gauge is no good
 

00:12:51.130 --> 00:12:53.280
from scratch the strain gauge is no good
you have to throw it out and just I

00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:53.290
you have to throw it out and just I
 

00:12:53.290 --> 00:12:55.680
you have to throw it out and just I
can't really tell you why sometimes it

00:12:55.680 --> 00:12:55.690
can't really tell you why sometimes it
 

00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:57.530
can't really tell you why sometimes it
happens but it does sometimes happen

00:12:57.530 --> 00:12:57.540
happens but it does sometimes happen
 

00:12:57.540 --> 00:13:01.080
happens but it does sometimes happen
okay now the next thing for us to do is

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:01.090
okay now the next thing for us to do is
 

00:13:01.090 --> 00:13:03.930
okay now the next thing for us to do is
to solder two wires to these two little

00:13:03.930 --> 00:13:03.940
to solder two wires to these two little
 

00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:07.560
to solder two wires to these two little
pads here now it's always a good

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:07.570
pads here now it's always a good
 

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.690
pads here now it's always a good
practice because as I mentioned the

00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:09.700
practice because as I mentioned the
 

00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.110
practice because as I mentioned the
strain gauges are very delicate we're

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:13.120
strain gauges are very delicate we're
 

00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.580
strain gauges are very delicate we're
going to just cover up

00:13:15.580 --> 00:13:15.590
going to just cover up
 

00:13:15.590 --> 00:13:18.280
going to just cover up
like surgery cover everything except

00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:18.290
like surgery cover everything except
 

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:20.950
like surgery cover everything except
what we're working on and we're just

00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:20.960
what we're working on and we're just
 

00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.500
what we're working on and we're just
keeping the two islands there exposed

00:13:23.500 --> 00:13:23.510
keeping the two islands there exposed
 

00:13:23.510 --> 00:13:28.420
keeping the two islands there exposed
for soldering okay so now this is our

00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:28.430
for soldering okay so now this is our
 

00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.610
for soldering okay so now this is our
soldering iron out to do the strain

00:13:30.610 --> 00:13:30.620
soldering iron out to do the strain
 

00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:32.740
soldering iron out to do the strain
gauge soldering you really do have to

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:32.750
gauge soldering you really do have to
 

00:13:32.750 --> 00:13:35.110
gauge soldering you really do have to
have a good tip on the soldering iron

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:35.120
have a good tip on the soldering iron
 

00:13:35.120 --> 00:13:38.200
have a good tip on the soldering iron
otherwise it will be ruined so this tip

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:38.210
otherwise it will be ruined so this tip
 

00:13:38.210 --> 00:13:40.030
otherwise it will be ruined so this tip
is in fairly good condition there is a

00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:40.040
is in fairly good condition there is a
 

00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:43.270
is in fairly good condition there is a
wet sponge at the bottom of the base of

00:13:43.270 --> 00:13:43.280
wet sponge at the bottom of the base of
 

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.980
wet sponge at the bottom of the base of
the soldering station which you can use

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:44.990
the soldering station which you can use
 

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:47.830
the soldering station which you can use
to clear it clean the tip we also have

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:47.840
to clear it clean the tip we also have
 

00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.580
to clear it clean the tip we also have
one of these tip cleaning trays which

00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:51.590
one of these tip cleaning trays which
 

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:53.950
one of these tip cleaning trays which
you can dip the tip in make sure the tip

00:13:53.950 --> 00:13:53.960
you can dip the tip in make sure the tip
 

00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:56.470
you can dip the tip in make sure the tip
is shiny when you do this next operation

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:56.480
is shiny when you do this next operation
 

00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:00.280
is shiny when you do this next operation
now these strain gauges if you leave the

00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:00.290
now these strain gauges if you leave the
 

00:14:00.290 --> 00:14:02.440
now these strain gauges if you leave the
soldering iron on the strain gauge too

00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:02.450
soldering iron on the strain gauge too
 

00:14:02.450 --> 00:14:04.540
soldering iron on the strain gauge too
long you'll melt it and ruin it so this

00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:04.550
long you'll melt it and ruin it so this
 

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:07.690
long you'll melt it and ruin it so this
operation has to be done quickly I am my

00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:07.700
operation has to be done quickly I am my
 

00:14:07.700 --> 00:14:09.850
operation has to be done quickly I am my
object here is to create two little

00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:09.860
object here is to create two little
 

00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:12.250
object here is to create two little
balls of solder on on the middle of each

00:14:12.250 --> 00:14:12.260
balls of solder on on the middle of each
 

00:14:12.260 --> 00:14:15.430
balls of solder on on the middle of each
one of these lands now you must you must

00:14:15.430 --> 00:14:15.440
one of these lands now you must you must
 

00:14:15.440 --> 00:14:17.920
one of these lands now you must you must
put the soldering iron to the island

00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:17.930
put the soldering iron to the island
 

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.900
put the soldering iron to the island
first and then bring in the solder but

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:19.910
first and then bring in the solder but
 

00:14:19.910 --> 00:14:22.150
first and then bring in the solder but
don't leave it too long otherwise you're

00:14:22.150 --> 00:14:22.160
don't leave it too long otherwise you're
 

00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.010
don't leave it too long otherwise you're
going to melt the strain gauge so you

00:14:24.010 --> 00:14:24.020
going to melt the strain gauge so you
 

00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:29.910
going to melt the strain gauge so you
kind of have to do this quickly but

00:14:29.910 --> 00:14:29.920
 

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.009
I'm bouncing it up and down just because

00:14:32.009 --> 00:14:32.019
I'm bouncing it up and down just because
 

00:14:32.019 --> 00:14:33.720
I'm bouncing it up and down just because
I don't want to keep it on there for too

00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:33.730
I don't want to keep it on there for too
 

00:14:33.730 --> 00:14:36.060
I don't want to keep it on there for too
long and hopefully if you get lucky what

00:14:36.060 --> 00:14:36.070
long and hopefully if you get lucky what
 

00:14:36.070 --> 00:14:39.920
long and hopefully if you get lucky what
just happened to me will happen to you a

00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:39.930
just happened to me will happen to you a
 

00:14:39.930 --> 00:14:42.750
just happened to me will happen to you a
little ball of solder just a perfect

00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:42.760
little ball of solder just a perfect
 

00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:45.420
little ball of solder just a perfect
little ball of solder will be left on

00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:45.430
little ball of solder will be left on
 

00:14:45.430 --> 00:14:49.230
little ball of solder will be left on
that island and make sure the two balls

00:14:49.230 --> 00:14:49.240
that island and make sure the two balls
 

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:50.879
that island and make sure the two balls
don't touch each other because you can't

00:14:50.879 --> 00:14:50.889
don't touch each other because you can't
 

00:14:50.889 --> 00:15:00.249
don't touch each other because you can't
short this out okay

00:15:00.249 --> 00:15:00.259
 

00:15:00.259 --> 00:15:02.169
the next thing we're going to do is

00:15:02.169 --> 00:15:02.179
the next thing we're going to do is
 

00:15:02.179 --> 00:15:04.299
the next thing we're going to do is
we're going to take the wire that you

00:15:04.299 --> 00:15:04.309
we're going to take the wire that you
 

00:15:04.309 --> 00:15:07.960
we're going to take the wire that you
were given and we're going to strip it a

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:07.970
were given and we're going to strip it a
 

00:15:07.970 --> 00:15:13.809
were given and we're going to strip it a
little bit using the stripper here to

00:15:13.809 --> 00:15:13.819
little bit using the stripper here to
 

00:15:13.819 --> 00:15:17.199
little bit using the stripper here to
just take off a very small amount of the

00:15:17.199 --> 00:15:17.209
just take off a very small amount of the
 

00:15:17.209 --> 00:15:25.650
just take off a very small amount of the
wire okay and

00:15:25.650 --> 00:15:25.660
 

00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:28.540
this is what I've done here this is what

00:15:28.540 --> 00:15:28.550
this is what I've done here this is what
 

00:15:28.550 --> 00:15:30.610
this is what I've done here this is what
it looks like now and I'm going to now

00:15:30.610 --> 00:15:30.620
it looks like now and I'm going to now
 

00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:33.370
it looks like now and I'm going to now
apply solder to the ends of these wires

00:15:33.370 --> 00:15:33.380
apply solder to the ends of these wires
 

00:15:33.380 --> 00:15:36.400
apply solder to the ends of these wires
now first I'm twisting them around this

00:15:36.400 --> 00:15:36.410
now first I'm twisting them around this
 

00:15:36.410 --> 00:15:38.140
now first I'm twisting them around this
is stranded wire so it's nice and

00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:38.150
is stranded wire so it's nice and
 

00:15:38.150 --> 00:15:46.950
is stranded wire so it's nice and
flexible it's very easy to work with

00:15:46.950 --> 00:15:46.960
 

00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:50.220
those are the wires twisted and now i'm

00:15:50.220 --> 00:15:50.230
those are the wires twisted and now i'm
 

00:15:50.230 --> 00:15:53.490
those are the wires twisted and now i'm
going to apply solder to them okay so

00:15:53.490 --> 00:15:53.500
going to apply solder to them okay so
 

00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:55.500
going to apply solder to them okay so
we've taken out one of these little

00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:55.510
we've taken out one of these little
 

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.530
we've taken out one of these little
devices called a third hand tool and i

00:15:58.530 --> 00:15:58.540
devices called a third hand tool and i
 

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:01.710
devices called a third hand tool and i
just clipped the wire in there's just so

00:16:01.710 --> 00:16:01.720
just clipped the wire in there's just so
 

00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:05.790
just clipped the wire in there's just so
I can't in the end of this wire so I'm

00:16:05.790 --> 00:16:05.800
I can't in the end of this wire so I'm
 

00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:07.620
I can't in the end of this wire so I'm
going to hold the soldering iron

00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:07.630
going to hold the soldering iron
 

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.590
going to hold the soldering iron
underneath the wire and just touch it

00:16:10.590 --> 00:16:10.600
underneath the wire and just touch it
 

00:16:10.600 --> 00:16:13.350
underneath the wire and just touch it
with solder and kind of stroke it on the

00:16:13.350 --> 00:16:13.360
with solder and kind of stroke it on the
 

00:16:13.360 --> 00:16:16.200
with solder and kind of stroke it on the
top and bottom and I'm going to do it on

00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:16.210
top and bottom and I'm going to do it on
 

00:16:16.210 --> 00:16:25.759
top and bottom and I'm going to do it on
this one as well

00:16:25.759 --> 00:16:25.769
 

00:16:25.769 --> 00:16:28.850
now it may be subtle there is solder

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860
now it may be subtle there is solder
 

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:31.040
now it may be subtle there is solder
that actually flow capillary action

00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:31.050
that actually flow capillary action
 

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.710
that actually flow capillary action
between the the small strands of wire

00:16:33.710 --> 00:16:33.720
between the the small strands of wire
 

00:16:33.720 --> 00:16:37.429
between the the small strands of wire
brain solder in and now it's pretty much

00:16:37.429 --> 00:16:37.439
brain solder in and now it's pretty much
 

00:16:37.439 --> 00:16:39.439

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:47.660
 

00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:53.230
i would say i would say something like

00:16:53.230 --> 00:16:53.240
i would say i would say something like
 

00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:57.000
i would say i would say something like
an eighth of an inch of wire maybe less

00:16:57.000 --> 00:16:57.010
an eighth of an inch of wire maybe less
 

00:16:57.010 --> 00:16:59.920
an eighth of an inch of wire maybe less
showing and now we will attempt to

00:16:59.920 --> 00:16:59.930
showing and now we will attempt to
 

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:05.350
showing and now we will attempt to
solder it onto the strain gauge okay so

00:17:05.350 --> 00:17:05.360
solder it onto the strain gauge okay so
 

00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.520
solder it onto the strain gauge okay so
if your eyesight isn't as good as as it

00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:09.530
if your eyesight isn't as good as as it
 

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:12.370
if your eyesight isn't as good as as it
should be you might want to try wearing

00:17:12.370 --> 00:17:12.380
should be you might want to try wearing
 

00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:15.910

these magnifying goggles it really does

00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:15.920
these magnifying goggles it really does
 

00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:19.120
these magnifying goggles it really does
make this job a lot easier so I'm

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:19.130
make this job a lot easier so I'm
 

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:20.830
make this job a lot easier so I'm
putting them on because my eyes have

00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:20.840
putting them on because my eyes have
 

00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:23.440
putting them on because my eyes have
really not gotten bad over the years and

00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:23.450
really not gotten bad over the years and
 

00:17:23.450 --> 00:17:28.360
really not gotten bad over the years and
now if if you're successful at soldering

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:28.370
now if if you're successful at soldering
 

00:17:28.370 --> 00:17:30.640
now if if you're successful at soldering
this properly we are not going to use

00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:30.650
this properly we are not going to use
 

00:17:30.650 --> 00:17:33.220
this properly we are not going to use
any more solder this is now a reflow

00:17:33.220 --> 00:17:33.230
any more solder this is now a reflow
 

00:17:33.230 --> 00:17:35.350
any more solder this is now a reflow
technique so we're just going to take

00:17:35.350 --> 00:17:35.360
technique so we're just going to take
 

00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:37.420
technique so we're just going to take
the soldering iron make sure it's clean

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:44.240
 

00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:47.430
if everything goes according to plan I

00:17:47.430 --> 00:17:47.440
if everything goes according to plan I
 

00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:50.290
if everything goes according to plan I
shouldn't have to do anything but really

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:50.300
shouldn't have to do anything but really
 

00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:56.140
shouldn't have to do anything but really
touch the wire but maybe i will just so

00:17:56.140 --> 00:17:56.150
touch the wire but maybe i will just so
 

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:58.260
touch the wire but maybe i will just so
this is this little orange wire again a

00:17:58.260 --> 00:17:58.270
this is this little orange wire again a
 

00:17:58.270 --> 00:18:00.730
this is this little orange wire again a
soldering iron has to be really clean

00:18:00.730 --> 00:18:00.740
soldering iron has to be really clean
 

00:18:00.740 --> 00:18:04.030

and you should get everything to me melt

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:17.330
 

00:18:17.330 --> 00:18:21.000
once you get one wire on there you can

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:21.010
once you get one wire on there you can
 

00:18:21.010 --> 00:18:28.290
once you get one wire on there you can
play the same game with the other wire

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:28.300
 

00:18:28.300 --> 00:18:31.990
now I'm looking at it through my

00:18:31.990 --> 00:18:32.000
now I'm looking at it through my
 

00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:34.180
now I'm looking at it through my
magnifying glasses they look it looks

00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:34.190
magnifying glasses they look it looks
 

00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.550
magnifying glasses they look it looks
like a really good joint I'm not sure

00:18:36.550 --> 00:18:36.560
like a really good joint I'm not sure
 

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.370
like a really good joint I'm not sure
how well it came out on here that looks

00:18:39.370 --> 00:18:39.380
how well it came out on here that looks
 

00:18:39.380 --> 00:18:42.790
how well it came out on here that looks
pretty nice now to completely check this

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:42.800
pretty nice now to completely check this
 

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:45.430
pretty nice now to completely check this
out we're going to take our multimeter

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:45.440
out we're going to take our multimeter
 

00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:47.860
out we're going to take our multimeter
and we will measure the resistance this

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:47.870
and we will measure the resistance this
 

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:51.550
and we will measure the resistance this

of resistance so let's see what it

00:19:08.110 --> 00:19:08.120
of resistance so let's see what it
 

00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.740
of resistance so let's see what it
measures so we are now going to just

00:19:11.740 --> 00:19:11.750
measures so we are now going to just
 

00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.330
measures so we are now going to just
make sure we got a good solder

00:19:13.330 --> 00:19:13.340
make sure we got a good solder
 

00:19:13.340 --> 00:19:16.240
make sure we got a good solder
connection on our strain gauges so here

00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:16.250
connection on our strain gauges so here
 

00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.490
connection on our strain gauges so here
are the ends of the strain gauge wire I

00:19:18.490 --> 00:19:18.500
are the ends of the strain gauge wire I
 

00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:22.090
are the ends of the strain gauge wire I
am going to put the multimeter in ohms

00:19:22.090 --> 00:19:22.100
am going to put the multimeter in ohms
 

00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:24.820
am going to put the multimeter in ohms
and I'm going to touch it with I'm

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:24.830
and I'm going to touch it with I'm
 

00:19:24.830 --> 00:19:27.130
and I'm going to touch it with I'm
holding it with my fingers and there is

00:19:27.130 --> 00:19:27.140
holding it with my fingers and there is
 

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:31.660
holding it with my fingers and there is
the reading of 120 120 point 8 ohms that

00:19:31.660 --> 00:19:31.670
the reading of 120 120 point 8 ohms that
 

00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:34.290
the reading of 120 120 point 8 ohms that
looks great and make sure we didn't just

00:19:34.290 --> 00:19:34.300
looks great and make sure we didn't just
 

00:19:34.300 --> 00:19:37.690
looks great and make sure we didn't just
short it to the piece itself so measure

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:37.700
short it to the piece itself so measure
 

00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:40.840
short it to the piece itself so measure
the resistance from let's say one wire

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:40.850
the resistance from let's say one wire
 

00:19:40.850 --> 00:19:43.360
the resistance from let's say one wire
to the part and it measures open

00:19:43.360 --> 00:19:43.370
to the part and it measures open
 

00:19:43.370 --> 00:19:45.430
to the part and it measures open
circuited and we'll just play the same

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:45.440
circuited and we'll just play the same
 

00:19:45.440 --> 00:19:47.170
circuited and we'll just play the same
game with the other wire and this is

00:19:47.170 --> 00:19:47.180
game with the other wire and this is
 

00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:48.850
game with the other wire and this is
just to make sure that none of the wires

00:19:48.850 --> 00:19:48.860
just to make sure that none of the wires
 

00:19:48.860 --> 00:19:51.430
just to make sure that none of the wires
are touching the specimen so everything

00:19:51.430 --> 00:19:51.440
are touching the specimen so everything
 

00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:54.730
are touching the specimen so everything
looks good remember when holding leads

00:19:54.730 --> 00:19:54.740
looks good remember when holding leads
 

00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.730
looks good remember when holding leads
to an ohmmeter like I'm doing right here

00:19:57.730 --> 00:19:57.740
to an ohmmeter like I'm doing right here
 

00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:00.640
to an ohmmeter like I'm doing right here
I'm actually measuring the resistance of

00:20:00.640 --> 00:20:00.650
I'm actually measuring the resistance of
 

00:20:00.650 --> 00:20:01.980
I'm actually measuring the resistance of
my body

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:01.990
my body
 

00:20:01.990 --> 00:20:05.730
my body
with the strain gauge but since my body

00:20:05.730 --> 00:20:05.740
with the strain gauge but since my body
 

00:20:05.740 --> 00:20:07.799
with the strain gauge but since my body
is mega ohms and the strain gauge is

00:20:07.799 --> 00:20:07.809
is mega ohms and the strain gauge is
 

00:20:07.809 --> 00:20:09.690
is mega ohms and the strain gauge is
only 120 ohms it's not really going to

00:20:09.690 --> 00:20:09.700
only 120 ohms it's not really going to
 

00:20:09.700 --> 00:20:11.970
only 120 ohms it's not really going to
matter that much okay that's how it's

00:20:11.970 --> 00:20:11.980
matter that much okay that's how it's
 

00:20:11.980 --> 00:20:15.120
matter that much okay that's how it's
done good luck
