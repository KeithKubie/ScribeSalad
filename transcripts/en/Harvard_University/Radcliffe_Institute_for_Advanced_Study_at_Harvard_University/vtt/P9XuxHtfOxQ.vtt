00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:06.260
- One of the things
I'm hoping to learn is,

00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.970
are their actual solutions that
can be found in some of the new

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:15.300
philosophy, the new poetry, and
the new novels called cli-fi?

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.620
Cli-fi mean, simply,
climate fiction.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:23.240
It actually is a vast array
of different kinds of literary

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.020
products, everything from
memoirs that have some kind

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:31.160
of emphasis on climate change,
so not necessarily fictive,

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.770
maybe fictive elements
as all memoir has,

00:00:33.770 --> 00:00:38.050
to novels to youth
fictions-- oh,

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:42.230
there's a great YA series
of fictions out there that,

00:00:42.230 --> 00:00:45.440
in various respects,
touch on climate change--

00:00:45.440 --> 00:00:46.820
to film.

00:00:46.820 --> 00:00:49.760
So climate fiction is a
very broad multimedia,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.170
multigenre project that
many artists and filmmakers

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.900
and authors have been
pursuing in an attempt

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:59.780
to tell the story
of climate change.

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.790
My own feeling is
that cli-fi could

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.200
be a much more capacious term.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.660
I don't really
understand the distancing

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:07.190
that some authors take from it.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:08.930
But I'm respectful of it.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:11.120
Other terms that have
come into being beside it

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.760
include Anthropocene
fiction, looking

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.440
at the moment of
the Anthropocene

00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.120
when we really see
ourselves driving

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.800
global climate, global
geology, and taking reflection

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:25.130
on that in fictional forms.

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.840
Solar punk is another
movement that's

00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.540
a relatively young movement
that's very positive

00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.560
and has a lot of focus on
technological solutions

00:01:33.560 --> 00:01:34.970
at the local level.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:37.760
I associate that with
youth maker culture,

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:41.450
looking at kind of local
solutions, local energy grids,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:45.170
ways of creating
autonomous functioning

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:50.660
systems if the larger structures
of society break down.

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:56.400
Climate fiction to me is
about loving the world,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.890
about not being afraid to
continue to love the world,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:03.310
even in a moment
of mass extinction.

00:02:03.310 --> 00:02:08.039
And it's also about
salvaging ourselves

00:02:08.039 --> 00:02:13.350
as a species, by which I mean
remaking ourselves in a way

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:22.040
that I hope means a more sound,
sustainable, and just future.
