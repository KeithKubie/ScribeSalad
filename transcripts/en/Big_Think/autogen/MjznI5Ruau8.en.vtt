well the first the first thing I
 

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.760
well the first the first thing I
remember wanting to be was a

remember wanting to be was a
 

00:00:09.770 --> 00:00:14.680
remember wanting to be was a
middleweight boxer and that was because

00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:14.690
middleweight boxer and that was because
 

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.890

I used to punch my older brother and he

00:00:17.890 --> 00:00:17.900
I used to punch my older brother and he
 

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:18.910

middleweight champion that was my first
 

00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:26.950
middleweight champion that was my first
ambition after that I drifted to science

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:26.960
ambition after that I drifted to science
 

00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:28.300
ambition after that I drifted to science
I think because my father was a chemist

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:28.310
I think because my father was a chemist
 

00:00:28.310 --> 00:00:30.849

respect for sort of the social utility
 

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:39.970

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:39.980
of the mind and in that period which was
 

00:00:39.980 --> 00:00:42.790

early 50s people were very optimistic

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:46.070
early 50s people were very optimistic
 

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.700
early 50s people were very optimistic
about the impact of technology on

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:47.710
about the impact of technology on

was generally considered to be one of
 

00:00:55.789 --> 00:00:58.180
was generally considered to be one of
suffering and so my parents certainly

00:00:58.180 --> 00:00:58.190
suffering and so my parents certainly
 

00:00:58.190 --> 00:01:01.180
suffering and so my parents certainly
didn't wish that on me and those were my

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:01.190
didn't wish that on me and those were my
 

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:03.250
didn't wish that on me and those were my
two choices it was either science for

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:03.260
two choices it was either science for
 

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.200
two choices it was either science for
the Arts we didn't have any why my

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:08.210
the Arts we didn't have any why my

the Arts we didn't have any why my
grandfather was a tailor so anything

00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:12.110
grandfather was a tailor so anything
 

00:01:12.110 --> 00:01:13.870
grandfather was a tailor so anything
involving the hands was out of question

00:01:13.870 --> 00:01:13.880
involving the hands was out of question
 

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.940
involving the hands was out of question
and when had to live the life of the

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:15.950
and when had to live the life of the
 

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.230
and when had to live the life of the
mind and there were really these two

00:01:17.230 --> 00:01:17.240
mind and there were really these two
 

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:24.010
mind and there were really these two
paths I chose science but toyed with

00:01:24.010 --> 00:01:24.020
paths I chose science but toyed with
 

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:26.080
paths I chose science but toyed with
writing when I was in high school and

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:26.090
writing when I was in high school and
 

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:29.200
writing when I was in high school and
college ultimately settling on

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.210
college ultimately settling on
 

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:31.660
college ultimately settling on
mathematics which I really enormously

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:31.670
mathematics which I really enormously
 

00:01:31.670 --> 00:01:35.980
mathematics which I really enormously
enjoyed and actually began to develop a

00:01:35.980 --> 00:01:35.990
enjoyed and actually began to develop a
 

00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.499
enjoyed and actually began to develop a
disdain for science because you know

00:01:38.499 --> 00:01:38.509
disdain for science because you know
 

00:01:38.509 --> 00:01:41.139
disdain for science because you know
science depended on the empirical world

00:01:41.139 --> 00:01:41.149
science depended on the empirical world
 

00:01:41.149 --> 00:01:44.889
science depended on the empirical world
as a source for the imagination words in

00:01:44.889 --> 00:01:44.899
as a source for the imagination words in
 

00:01:44.899 --> 00:01:46.450
as a source for the imagination words in
mathematics you didn't have to depend on

00:01:46.450 --> 00:01:46.460
mathematics you didn't have to depend on
 

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.399
mathematics you didn't have to depend on
on the empirical world so to me I

00:01:48.399 --> 00:01:48.409
on the empirical world so to me I
 

00:01:48.409 --> 00:01:50.020
on the empirical world so to me I
thought mathematics was really the

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:50.030
thought mathematics was really the
 

00:01:50.030 --> 00:01:53.380
thought mathematics was really the
highest enterprise of the mind but I

00:01:53.380 --> 00:01:53.390
highest enterprise of the mind but I
 

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:56.350
highest enterprise of the mind but I
wasn't good enough at it and it was

00:01:56.350 --> 00:01:56.360
wasn't good enough at it and it was
 

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.630
wasn't good enough at it and it was
taking me out of contact with humans so

00:01:58.630 --> 00:01:58.640
taking me out of contact with humans so
 

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.819
taking me out of contact with humans so
I decided I had to do socially useful so

00:02:00.819 --> 00:02:00.829
I decided I had to do socially useful so
 

00:02:00.829 --> 00:02:03.580
I decided I had to do socially useful so
I went into medicine and that was a

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:03.590
I went into medicine and that was a
 

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:07.120
I went into medicine and that was a
disaster I really couldn't deal with the

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:07.130
disaster I really couldn't deal with the
 

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:10.120
disaster I really couldn't deal with the
uncertainty of medicine so I started

00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:10.130
uncertainty of medicine so I started
 

00:02:10.130 --> 00:02:13.000
uncertainty of medicine so I started
doing research instead and that's how I

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:13.010
doing research instead and that's how I
 

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.770
doing research instead and that's how I
ended up being

00:02:14.770 --> 00:02:14.780
ended up being
 

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.490
ended up being
a biologist and molecular biologist so I

00:02:18.490 --> 00:02:18.500
a biologist and molecular biologist so I
 

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:21.570
a biologist and molecular biologist so I
didn't finish medical school I went into

00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:21.580
didn't finish medical school I went into
 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:26.170
didn't finish medical school I went into
microbial research instead and came back

00:02:26.170 --> 00:02:26.180
microbial research instead and came back
 

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.380
microbial research instead and came back
much later in my in my life to utilize

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.390
much later in my in my life to utilize
 

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:32.620
much later in my in my life to utilize
mathematics but in my case it was

00:02:32.620 --> 00:02:32.630
mathematics but in my case it was
 

00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.120
mathematics but in my case it was
entirely the influence of my parents

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
entirely the influence of my parents
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.920
entirely the influence of my parents

00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:38.930
they had admiration for the life of the
 

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:40.890
they had admiration for the life of the

mind and they didn't have admiration
 

00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:43.900
mind and they didn't have admiration
really for anything else I mean I guess

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:43.910
really for anything else I mean I guess
 

00:02:43.910 --> 00:02:45.160

crossed broke down cultural barriers so

00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:52.550
crossed broke down cultural barriers so
 

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:56.220
crossed broke down cultural barriers so
they had some admiration for people that

they had some admiration for people that

struck down political archetypes of
 

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:06.610
struck down political archetypes of
social archetypes but mainly they felt

social archetypes but mainly they felt

that their kids should be active with
 

00:03:08.330 --> 00:03:10.600
that their kids should be active with
their minds and do things that they if

behind us it didn't occur to me that you
actually had to imbue this I thought it

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:30.980
actually had to imbue this I thought it

artist and neither of my children had
 

00:03:40.519 --> 00:03:43.449
artist and neither of my children had
any interest in science and I realized

any interest in science and I realized
 

00:03:43.459 --> 00:03:46.509
any interest in science and I realized
that when it was too late so I miss that

00:03:46.509 --> 00:03:46.519
that when it was too late so I miss that
