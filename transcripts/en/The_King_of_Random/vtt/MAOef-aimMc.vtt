00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
Hey guys for this video I brought you out to Hawaii because

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:03.960
apparently I'm on vacation.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:06.340
So while we're here, I teamed up with a company called LifeVantage

00:00:06.340 --> 00:00:08.440
to tell you about a new product they just developed

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:10.660
and to share with you my ten favorite life hacks for

00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:11.800
when you're down at the beach.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.120
Let's jump right in.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.260
When you pull up to the beach it's not alway convenient

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:18.720
to take your car keys with you, but you wont find lockers

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:20.720
at the beach and you can't take your keys with you in the ocean

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.240
either, so what do you do?

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.400
Try looping a long sturdy blade of grass through your keychain, tying

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:26.540
it off to form a ring.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:29.020
Then press the loop into one of the top treads of

00:00:29.020 --> 00:00:30.660
your tire, holding it in place with a small pebble.

00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:33.980
Flip the keys back so they dangle behind the tire

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:36.380
and they'll be out of sight, out of mind, and off the ground as well.

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.320
So they won't get exposed to moisture if it rains while you are gone.

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:43.100
Now if you are in a hurry and don't have the time or patience

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:45.160
to jury-rig a hook, you could simply toss your keys

00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:47.160
behind one of your tires instead.

00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:48.780
I've been using this trick for years,

00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:52.260
and as long as you do it discreetly, no one will have any idea your keys are even back there.

00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:56.200
So go have fun! Play without the worry of losing or destroying your keys at the beach.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:01:00.260
because when you come back, you should find they're stashed exactly where you left them.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:03.440
The next time you want to go snorkeling

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:06.400
but don't have a safe place for your phone, keys, and cash,

00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:09.360
you can use a clean baby diaper to stash all your valuables instead.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:11.980
Use the sticky tabs to hold the bundle together,

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:15.760
and to the untrained eye, it's just a used diaper that nobody wants to touch.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.740
By the way, if you set it down next to your towel and flip-flops,

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:21.140
it'll be a lot less likely to get thrown away by accident.

00:01:22.780 --> 00:01:24.360
Now if you want to go one step further,

00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:28.760
try opening a pack of chocolate spread and rubbing some along the inside flap of the diaper.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.760
This will make your decoy diaper look authentically used

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.460
and should be enough to discourage any would-be beach thieves

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:35.820
from finding your stuff.

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:38.940
Have you ever stopped to unravel a poopy diaper lying at the beach?

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:41.320
Of course you haven't! And nobody else will either.

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.140
To prove this point, I left mine exposed and unattended for over an hour,

00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:48.400
and when I came back, everything was exactly the way it was when I left it.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.740
When you're bodysurfing, splashing in the waves, or out for a little swim,

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.640
you may suddenly notice that your ears don't feel normal anymore.

00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.940
The feeling of water trapped in your ears is uncomfortable, and makes it difficult to hear.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.040
Point the affected ear to the ground and jump up and down with a few sharp jolts.

00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.220
You should hear the water tension break and clear out almost instantly.

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:09.840
The key here is in the sudden jolts at the end.

00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:14.180
Do the same thing with the other ear, and you should feel cleared up and back to normal as easy as that.

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:18.240
Now some people suggest that blowing up a balloon will have the exact same effect.

00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.800
So I gave that method a try as well,

00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:21.580
but without any success at all.

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.360
It is a nice idea, but I don't think it actually works.

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:28.120
When you're out snorkeling or diving to the bottom of the ocean,

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:32.080
you're going to see some really amazing things, but your ears are going to start hurting like crazy as well.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.960
This is because the air in your head is being compressed.

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:38.060
Plug your nose, and gently blow into it as you do.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:41.920
This will force air into your eustachian tubes and help equalize the pressure

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.820
so you can dive down even further without pain, and without causing any damage.

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.180
Walking around barefoot on a sandy beach is very relaxing,

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.100
but you're quickly going to find the bottoms of your feet

00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:55.220
get caked in a very fine sand that nothing seems to remove

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:56.320
and that's frustrating.

00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:57.700
Here's what you do.

00:02:57.700 --> 00:03:00.360
Load up a rag with a pile of baby powder right in the center.

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:02.940
Then use string or rubber bands to tie it into a ball

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:06.220
and you've just created a super sand remover that will seem to work miracles.

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:08.280
Tap it to your skin and it releases

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.120
moisture-absorbing powder and prevents any new sand from sticking in its place.

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.840
So, when it's time to head back to the car,

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:16.980
just sit down, brush off your feet a bit, and give your skin a little rub.

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:19.660
Like magic, the grains of sand all slide off with ease

00:03:19.660 --> 00:03:22.760
leaving your feet feeling silky, smooth, and sand-free.

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:26.900
This also works on arms, legs, and even the tops of your sandals as well

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.500
so, no more problems with sticky, irritating, and stubborn sand.

00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:34.360
You can avoid getting water and sand in your phone

00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.720
by dropping it into a clear plastic sandwich bag and sealing it up airtight.

00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:40.460
This beefs up your phone's resistance to the elements

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:44.320
but still allows you to text, watch videos, and even make phone calls as well.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.540
If you open a small gap in one of the corners of your sandwich bag and suck the air out,

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.660
it will create a vacuum seal around your phone that can act as an improvised water-proof case.

00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:55.540
Zip up the seal airtight again,

00:03:55.540 --> 00:03:57.660
and you've got a make-shift underwater video camera

00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:59.840
that you can use to check out the open ocean around you

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.760
but do it at your own risk.

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:05.040
Nothing's worse than being sick when you're on vacation,

00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.420
so before you actually get sick,

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:09.380
try adding a pinch of salt and baking soda to a cup of water

00:04:09.380 --> 00:04:10.720
to give your sinuses a rinse.

00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:13.000
Pour the mixture into one of your nostrils,

00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.420
and it will fill up your sinuses completely

00:04:14.420 --> 00:04:17.200
to the point where it starts flowing freely out the other side.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.680
It looks and feels incredibly bizarre,

00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:21.900
but it helps wash away pollen, bacteria,

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:23.980
and any other irritants festering up inside

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.340
before they become a problem.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:28.280
It is a real technique and it really does work,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.880
and it just might help with the quality of your next vacation.

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:33.800
Some experts suggest that by lowering your stress levels,

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:35.920
you actually have a better chance of living a longer, happier life,

00:04:36.420 --> 00:04:38.180
and the people at LifeVantage agree.

00:04:38.180 --> 00:04:40.660
LifeVantage is a company that some people say

00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:42.260
is at the forefront of nutrigenomics,

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:46.040
and apparently they're successfully bio-hacking the aging process as well.

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:48.780
Their new line of Protandim synergizers

00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.980
are designed to improve health on a cellular level

00:04:50.980 --> 00:04:53.060
and help redefine the aging of our cells.

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:55.880
The Protandim nrf2 synergizer

00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.360
is LifeVantage's original nutrigenomic breakthrough

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.520
designed to fight oxidative stress which is the

00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.120
main biochemical effect of aging on our cells.

00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:05.740
And their Protandim NRF1 synergizer

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:08.160
prevents the decline of mitochondria in the cells,

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.300
which helps reduce the second biochemical effect of aging as well.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.580
When these two products are taken together,

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:16.100
they provide a viable way to reduce cellular stress

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.040
which could lead to a longer, healthier life

00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:20.960
resulting in more time you could be spending at the beach.

00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.380
So there you have it, guys!

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:23.720
