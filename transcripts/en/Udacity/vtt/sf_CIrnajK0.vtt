00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.450
Well let's see,
let's look at the point -3, 6.

00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:04.726
1, 2, 3.

00:00:04.726 --> 00:00:06.548
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.

00:00:06.548 --> 00:00:12.990
This would be -3 on the x-axis and
6 on the y.

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:15.440
And only this blue
graph goes through it.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.400
We can see this also goes through
the point 0, 0, the origin.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.250
Or it comes pretty close,
that was my drawing mistake.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.632
And it goes through the point 3, -6.

00:00:23.632 --> 00:00:26.430
So it looks like that's
gotta be the correct answer.
