00:00:00.373 --> 00:00:04.296
- [Voiceover] What we have
here is a picture graph,

00:00:04.296 --> 00:00:08.162
and the reason why it's
called a picture graph is

00:00:08.162 --> 00:00:12.701
because it uses pictures
to give us information.

00:00:12.701 --> 00:00:16.597
In this case, it uses
the picture of a mouse

00:00:16.597 --> 00:00:19.237
and it tells us that one of
these little mouse pictures

00:00:19.237 --> 00:00:22.881
means one mouse, it equals one mouse.

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:25.396
So what is this picture graph telling us?

00:00:25.396 --> 00:00:28.864
Well, the title says "Mice on Farm,"

00:00:28.864 --> 00:00:30.451
so this tells us how many mice are

00:00:30.451 --> 00:00:32.993
in the different places in a farm,

00:00:32.993 --> 00:00:34.549
and you can see here the different places

00:00:34.549 --> 00:00:36.175
where we might find mice.

00:00:36.175 --> 00:00:39.481
We could find mice in
the house, in the barn,

00:00:39.481 --> 00:00:42.865
in the pasture, or the corral.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.427
And then these, I guess
you could say these stacks

00:00:45.427 --> 00:00:47.226
of these mouse pictures tell us

00:00:47.226 --> 00:00:50.784
how many mice there are
in each of those places.

00:00:50.784 --> 00:00:52.810
So, for example, in the house, we see,

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:54.946
well this, this they tell
us, that's one mouse,

00:00:54.946 --> 00:00:59.291
this is one plus one plus
one plus one, or four mice.

00:00:59.291 --> 00:01:03.190
Four mice in the house.

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.033
That's four right over
there, write that over there.

00:01:07.125 --> 00:01:08.297
Four mice in the house.

00:01:08.297 --> 00:01:09.821
How many in the barn?

00:01:10.575 --> 00:01:15.360
Well, same idea, one, two,
let me use a different color,

00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.394
one, two, three, four, five, six,

00:01:19.394 --> 00:01:24.394
so there are six mice,
six mice, in the barn.

00:01:24.983 --> 00:01:26.315
So there's six mice in the barn,

00:01:26.315 --> 00:01:27.626
let me just write that down.

00:01:27.626 --> 00:01:31.729
So six mice in the barn,
what about the pasture?

00:01:31.729 --> 00:01:33.558
Well, we see that
there's three mice there,

00:01:33.558 --> 00:01:36.212
that's 'cause each of these
pictures is one mouse.

00:01:36.212 --> 00:01:38.074
The person who made the
picture graph could've made

00:01:38.074 --> 00:01:40.542
each of those pictures a
different number of mice,

00:01:40.542 --> 00:01:42.269
but here each one is one mouse,

00:01:42.269 --> 00:01:45.013
so there's three in the pasture.

00:01:45.013 --> 00:01:46.862
Three in the pasture.

00:01:46.862 --> 00:01:49.772
And then, finally, move over a little bit,

00:01:49.772 --> 00:01:53.902
and then finally there
are two in the corral.

00:01:53.902 --> 00:01:56.022
Two in the corral.

00:01:56.022 --> 00:01:56.730
So if someone asked you,

00:01:56.730 --> 00:01:59.792
"How many total mice
are there on this farm?"

00:01:59.792 --> 00:02:01.832
Well, you would add all of these up.

00:02:01.832 --> 00:02:05.857
You would say four plus six is 10,

00:02:05.857 --> 00:02:10.679
plus three is 13, plus 2 is 15.

00:02:10.693 --> 00:02:13.629
15 total mice on the farm.

00:02:13.629 --> 00:02:17.974
So once again, picture graph,
just a way to show data,

00:02:17.974 --> 00:02:19.251
to show information.

00:02:19.251 --> 00:02:24.251
This tells us how many mice
are in each part of the farm.

00:02:24.268 --> 00:02:25.183
If someone said, "How
many mice in the barn?"

00:02:25.183 --> 00:02:27.575
you say, okay, well, you
know, there's six mice.

00:02:27.575 --> 00:02:28.643
If someone says, "How many mice are

00:02:28.643 --> 00:02:32.016
"in the pasture and the corral combined?"

00:02:32.016 --> 00:02:33.563
Well, that's gonna be
the three in the pasture

00:02:33.563 --> 00:02:36.061
plus the two in the corral, or five.

00:02:36.061 --> 00:02:37.721
They said, "How many
mice in the whole farm?"

00:02:37.721 --> 00:02:40.723
and if these are all the
places where the mice could be,

00:02:40.723 --> 00:02:43.075
well, it's gonna be the four
plus six plus three plus two,

00:02:43.075 --> 00:02:45.948
or 15, and we're done.
