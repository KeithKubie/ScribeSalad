&gt;&gt; Nafiza: Technology, I technically
use it from the moment I wake up,

00:00:10.896 --> 00:00:13.046
because my cell phone
is my alarm clock.

00:00:15.256 --> 00:00:19.606
Like my iPod is in my pocket
while I walk to school.

00:00:20.276 --> 00:00:24.536
Oh, and I have to check
Facebook when I get home.

00:00:25.006 --> 00:00:30.346
My favorite games are like
racing games and fighting games.

00:00:31.126 --> 00:00:36.766
I spend a lot of time on Dance
Dance Revolution, which is awesome.

00:00:38.166 --> 00:00:42.426
And this is my avatar as
she typically will look.

00:00:42.896 --> 00:00:45.816
And I think initially, when
everyone goes into Second Life,

00:00:45.816 --> 00:00:49.516
they try to make their
avatar look like themselves,

00:00:49.516 --> 00:00:54.316
like especially facial features
wise, but I like the ocean very much.

00:00:54.316 --> 00:00:58.026
I thought I'd have a very
oceanic kind of eye color,

00:00:58.376 --> 00:01:00.136
so I thought that was
a good way, you know,

00:01:00.456 --> 00:01:02.696
to have my eye representative of me.

00:01:03.156 --> 00:01:04.536
&gt;&gt;Nafiza has been amazing.

00:01:04.776 --> 00:01:08.036
I met Nafiza two years ago when she
joined our virtual video project,

00:01:08.236 --> 00:01:10.636
which is a program which the
youth make animated movies

00:01:10.636 --> 00:01:11.506
about global issues.

00:01:11.506 --> 00:01:15.866
&gt;&gt;Video: He's wearing a Dalai
Lama necklace, you're suspended!

00:01:16.856 --> 00:01:19.826
&gt;&gt;Barry: So for example, one project
might mean that they build something

00:01:19.996 --> 00:01:22.816
in Second Life, but then
they'll photograph it and move it

00:01:22.816 --> 00:01:27.066
up to Flickr and then bring it from
Flickr into a digital comic program,

00:01:27.766 --> 00:01:33.436
output that as a PDF, and then put
it up in a blog entry on the blog.

00:01:34.056 --> 00:01:37.576
So the virtual becomes the
central place for gathering

00:01:37.806 --> 00:01:39.636
and to organize what
they're learning,

00:01:39.816 --> 00:01:42.466
but it's all about interconnecting
all these different mediums together

00:01:42.466 --> 00:01:44.406
as part of a seamless
educational experience.

00:01:44.856 --> 00:01:49.456
&gt;&gt;Student: Currently I'm working on
getting the movie down to one minute,

00:01:49.456 --> 00:01:50.996
trying to put the scenes
together, 'cause there's a--

00:01:51.316 --> 00:01:53.356
&gt;&gt;Tabitha: Now the exciting part
about their film making of that,

00:01:53.356 --> 00:01:54.876
they're not using real life cameras.

00:01:55.036 --> 00:01:57.016
They're using everything virtual.

00:01:57.166 --> 00:01:58.306
So they're using Second Life,

00:01:58.686 --> 00:02:01.296
which is a virtual community,
as a platform to learn.

00:02:01.666 --> 00:02:04.676
They're learning about computers
and all the software embedded

00:02:04.676 --> 00:02:06.696
and they're learning to
work with each other.

00:02:06.696 --> 00:02:10.846
&gt;&gt;Nafiza: -- and after he notices
that he can't get equal access

00:02:10.846 --> 00:02:13.936
to education in China, he
decides to leave with his mother--

00:02:14.386 --> 00:02:17.566
&gt;&gt;The virtual video project
we're doing is injustices

00:02:17.566 --> 00:02:19.236
in the educational system.

00:02:19.236 --> 00:02:23.446
And we divided them into the
United States, Brazil and Tibet.

00:02:24.396 --> 00:02:30.216
So each individual group is going to
focus on capturing a one minute film

00:02:30.216 --> 00:02:34.116
on the struggle one child
has when they're trying

00:02:34.196 --> 00:02:35.766
to attain higher education.

00:02:36.056 --> 00:02:38.006
&gt;&gt;Video: At this rate, we can't
afford to keep you in school,

00:02:38.006 --> 00:02:40.706
The tuition is already too
expensive for us Tibetans.

00:02:41.526 --> 00:02:42.976
&gt;&gt;Video: It's just not fair.

00:02:43.056 --> 00:02:47.286
&gt;&gt;Nafiza: I am helping a lot of
the students with little things

00:02:47.316 --> 00:02:48.726
like how do you turn the camera,

00:02:48.726 --> 00:02:51.176
how do you edit this,
how do you cut this?

00:02:51.536 --> 00:02:56.246
So I have taken on a more
leadership role than I did last year

00:02:56.246 --> 00:02:59.566
when I was also a student learning.

00:02:59.566 --> 00:03:01.046
&gt;&gt;Barry: Every year,
something new is coming out,

00:03:01.446 --> 00:03:03.476
and then something new is replacing
something else, and they grow

00:03:03.476 --> 00:03:05.676
and they expand and they reconnect,
That's gonna keep happening

00:03:05.676 --> 00:03:08.306
over their lives, and what we
need youth to be able to do

00:03:08.306 --> 00:03:11.426
to be digitally literate, is
to be able to not just know how

00:03:11.426 --> 00:03:13.336
to use the tools that are
currently in their lives,

00:03:13.626 --> 00:03:15.856
but how they can take advantage of
the latest tools when they come out,

00:03:16.066 --> 00:03:18.916
teach themselves and figure out how
to apply them for their education

00:03:18.916 --> 00:03:20.266
or for being civically engaged.

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:23.936
&gt;&gt;Nafiza: There's just so many topics
and world issues going on out there,

00:03:23.936 --> 00:03:25.686
it's hard to choose one--

00:03:25.686 --> 00:03:29.836
&gt;&gt;Last year I was judging the Games
for Change contest, and through that,

00:03:29.836 --> 00:03:32.036
I got to know about a
lot of different games,

00:03:32.036 --> 00:03:36.046
like Karma Tycoon.com
and Darfur is Dying,

00:03:36.046 --> 00:03:39.006
And they're basically games
based on the different struggles

00:03:39.006 --> 00:03:41.646
that are going on, and you
know, what's going on in Darfur,

00:03:41.646 --> 00:03:44.856
it's a very complicated issue,
it's not just ethnicity, it's also,

00:03:44.856 --> 00:03:49.036
you know, border issues, so it's
a really good way to, you know,

00:03:49.036 --> 00:03:53.416
introduce little kids to the topic
and give them a touch of reality.

00:03:54.176 --> 00:03:55.446
Let's see.

00:03:55.446 --> 00:03:57.466
&gt;&gt;Barry: Nafiza very quickly
became one of the young people

00:03:57.466 --> 00:03:59.906
in the program that people
look to for advice and support,

00:03:59.996 --> 00:04:03.926
We're able to see her confidence
of her ability, to use the program

00:04:03.926 --> 00:04:05.776
as a space for her to
not just do great things

00:04:05.996 --> 00:04:08.776
by making an amazing movie that's
been seen by over 10,000 people,

00:04:08.776 --> 00:04:11.786
but take up a role amongst her
peers and within the society

00:04:11.786 --> 00:04:13.126
where she can see herself
as a leader.

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:17.296
&gt;&gt;Nafiza: My iPod is like my entire
life, especially in the summer,

00:04:17.566 --> 00:04:20.426
and whenever it dies
it's like, recharge,

00:04:20.666 --> 00:04:25.076
listen to it while it's charging,
unplug, walk around, do something,

00:04:25.076 --> 00:04:29.146
listen to the iPod, But, you know,
I have to start relying on something

00:04:29.146 --> 00:04:31.766
that has better battery life, Yeah.

00:04:38.416 --> 00:04:40.556
