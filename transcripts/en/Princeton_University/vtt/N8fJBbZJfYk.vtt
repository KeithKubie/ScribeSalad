00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.750
DEREK LIDOW: Creativity,
innovation, and design

00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:10.650
teaches students
how to be creative

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.990
and how to apply that to solve
major real world problems.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:18.760
University tends
to focus students

00:00:18.760 --> 00:00:22.890
on convergent thinking, how to
come up with the best answer.

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:24.750
And so, students
don't get a chance

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:27.390
to practice divergent
thinking, coming up

00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:30.710
with all sorts of
possible solutions.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:33.280
That's what this class
is really good at.

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:34.060
MICHAEL IBERKLEID: As
soon as you walk in,

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:35.590
it's a room with a
bunch of possibilities

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.340
and a bunch of things
to play around with,

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.330
including your seating.


00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.860
You can sit in a cushion,
you can sit on the floor,

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:41.580
in a metal chair.


00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:44.090
So it's just like a place
where you can just come and do

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.910
whatever you want and
let your ideas flow.

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:47.450
YOLANDA YEH: Creativity
usually isn't

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.950
something you think
you can learn.

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:52.320
And so this class is
unique in that it gives you

00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.730
the tools and the
opportunities to practice it.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.310
DEREK LIDOW: The
final design project,

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.570
which is a wicked
design project,

00:00:59.570 --> 00:01:02.450
is mitigating high-risk
drinking on campus,

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.880
which is an gnarly
problem that's

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.830
been around for
hundreds of years.

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.300
And students, when they come
up with really good solutions,

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:11.310
they will have
tremendous confidence

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.680
that they can solve any
of the real world problems

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:14.970
that they come up against.


00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:17.240
TYLER HOPF: The final project,
solving binge drinking

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:21.960
on campus is the ultimate
first step to then after class.

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:25.170
Solving a real world problem,
or addressing it, at least,

00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:28.430
and really doing what they can
to change someone's behavior.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:31.510
So it's about designing
a policy, a campaign,

00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:32.700
a series of products.


00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:36.260
Really an entire project around
improving people's lives.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.380
MICHAEL IBERKLEID: I think
the guests were actually

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:39.380
the best part the class.


00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.160
Having people who worked for
gaming companies like Blizzard,

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.320
to the head of IDO, to
people who are very involved

00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:47.270
in the university,
just gave us a lot

00:01:47.270 --> 00:01:49.850
of different points of view in
terms of the different problems

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:52.140
we were addressing and how
to address those problems.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.270
And really, it's those
things that you can't really

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:55.020
read from a book.


00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.560
YOLANDA YEH: Essentially, what
we did was to build a website.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:01.530
And the idea is that people
can anonymously share and read

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:03.400
the stories from their
community to better

00:02:03.400 --> 00:02:06.900
learn about what the environment
here is actually like,

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:11.290
and to also be able to ask
questions and learn facts

00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:13.110
in a very organic
way on the site.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.390
MICHAEL IBERKLEID: Breaking
that mold of how to think

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:16.810
or what you're
actually learning.

00:02:16.810 --> 00:02:19.230
First of all, I thought, how
can you learn to be creative?

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.970
But it's the
structure behind it.

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:22.550
That's what we really
learned and what

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:25.010
I feel like really I'll take
out of this class the most.

00:02:25.010 --> 00:02:26.640
YOLANDA YEH: A lot
what I'm taking away

00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:29.710
is being really
creatively conscious.

00:02:29.710 --> 00:02:33.550
Thinking about applying
creativity to different places,

00:02:33.550 --> 00:02:35.880
and also the specific
techniques we

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:39.420
use to develop empathy
for your users,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:44.490
or to act on your feedback,
and just specific techniques

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:48.430
to jog your thinking,
brainstorming, and all that.
