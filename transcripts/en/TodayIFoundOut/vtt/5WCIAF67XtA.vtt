00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.780
The Real Life George Bailey

00:00:01.780 --> 00:00:05.170
The Real Life “George Bailey” Who Founded
Bank of Italy, which Would Become Bank of

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:08.520
America
The man was A.P. Giannini who was said to

00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.200
be who Frank Capra modeled the character of
George Bailey as well as the bank president

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:17.490
in Capra’s 1932 movie, American Madness,
after.

00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:22.410
At the age of 14, Giannini left school and
began working with his step father, Lorenzo

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:25.640
Scatena, in the produce industry as a produce
broker.

00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:29.820
By the time he was 31, he was able to sell
much of his interest in this company to his

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:32.180
employees and had planned to retire.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:36.879
However, one year later, he was asked to join
the Columbus Savings &amp; Loan Society, which

00:00:36.879 --> 00:00:40.059
was a small bank in North Beach, California.

00:00:40.059 --> 00:00:44.589
Once he joined up, he found that almost nobody
at the Savings &amp; Loan, nor other banks, were

00:00:44.589 --> 00:00:48.350
willing to give loans to anyone but the rich
or those owning businesses.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:53.379
At first, Giannini attempted to convince the
other directors at the Savings &amp; Loan to start

00:00:53.379 --> 00:00:58.829
lending to working class citizens, to give
them home and auto loans, among other things.

00:00:58.829 --> 00:01:03.139
He felt that working class citizens, though
lacking in assets to guarantee the loan against,

00:01:03.139 --> 00:01:06.610
were generally honest and would pay back their
loans when they could.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:11.220
Further, by loaning them money, it would allow
working class citizens to better themselves

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.280
in ways they would not have been able to do
without the money lent to them, such as being

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.450
able to buy a home or to start a new business.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:23.100
He was never able to convince the other directors
to begin lending to the working class.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:26.510
Not to be dissuaded, he then set out to start
his own bank.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:31.600
With $150,000 raised from various friends
and family, Giannini founded the Bank of Italy

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.170
in 1904, which would be a bank specializing
in loaning money to the common man.

00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:41.390
The first Bank of Italy branch was in a converted
saloon across the street from the Savings

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:43.560
&amp; Loan he had formerly been a member of.

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:48.510
The assistant teller at the Bank of Italy
was the former bartender of that very saloon.

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:52.950
He then went about educating the working class
on what a bank does and how one could help

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:53.950
them.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:01:58.560
Also, because working class individuals typically
worked very long hours, Giannini’s bank

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.450
stayed open until around 10pm every night.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.659
At the time, banks traditionally closed around
3pm.

00:02:04.659 --> 00:02:09.440
Most importantly, he also made a practice
of not offering loans based on how much money

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.239
or equity a person had, but based primarily
on how he judged their character.

00:02:14.239 --> 00:02:20.459
Within a year, Bank of Italy had over $700,000
in deposits from these working class individuals,

00:02:20.459 --> 00:02:24.810
which is somewhere around $15-$20 million
today.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:30.239
Two years after the Bank of Italy was founded,
the great San Francisco earthquake of 1906

00:02:30.239 --> 00:02:37.849
occurred, which was a 7.7-8.25 earthquake
that resulted in 80% of the city being destroyed,

00:02:37.849 --> 00:02:45.950
over 3,000 deaths, and around 200,000-300,000
of the city’s 410,000 population left homeless,

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.829
because of the earthquake and subsequent fires.

00:02:48.829 --> 00:02:54.120
The Bank of Italy managed to be the only bank
able to open back up directly after the earthquake,

00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:57.069
despite the fact that the bank building itself
was unusable.

00:02:57.069 --> 00:03:01.402
Directly after the earthquake happened in
the very early hours of the morning, Giannini

00:03:01.402 --> 00:03:06.359
went and sifted through the rubble of his
building and gathered $2 million into a garbage

00:03:06.359 --> 00:03:11.700
man’s wagon, owned by Giobatta Cepollina
whose son would go on to work for Bank of

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:16.900
America because of a promise made by Giannini
to Cepollina in exchange for use of his wagon.

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:21.849
(Cepollina’s son was able to retire from
Bank of American at 41.)

00:03:21.849 --> 00:03:26.060
After gathering the money, Giannini then took
it outside of town, covered in garbage to

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.129
protect it.

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.640
Next, he headed out to the docks and setup
a temporary bank with two barrels and a piece

00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:33.080
of wood as his desk.

00:03:33.080 --> 00:03:37.799
He then began taking deposits and giving loans
to help not only businesses, but also the

00:03:37.799 --> 00:03:41.969
working class, so that they’d have the money
they needed to rebuild their homes and their

00:03:41.969 --> 00:03:42.969
lives.

00:03:42.969 --> 00:03:47.090
At that time, none of the other banks had
re-opened and most did not do so for several

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:51.480
weeks, so few who kept their money in banks
had access to it and many others had lost

00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:53.670
everything in fires.

00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:57.889
Giannini also immediately sent two ships to
Washington and Oregon to acquire large amounts

00:03:57.889 --> 00:04:02.579
of lumber to try to work around the inevitable
materials shortage that he foresaw.

00:04:02.579 --> 00:04:08.379
That lumber comprised most of the lumber available
in the early stages of rebuilding San Francisco.

00:04:08.379 --> 00:04:12.680
Because so many had lost everything, including
identification papers, Giannini gave these

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:16.519
people loans based on nothing but a signature
and a handshake.

00:04:16.519 --> 00:04:20.321
He supposedly never tired of mentioning to
other bank big-wigs that wouldn’t loan to

00:04:20.321 --> 00:04:25.710
the common man that every single loan he made
that way to so many working class individuals

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:28.020
was ultimately repaid in full.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:32.980
During his time with Bank of Italy and eventually
Bank of America, as it became, he instituted

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:37.240
a variety of practices that are standard among
nearly all banks today.

00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:42.120
He also was a key figure in making California
what it is today, including: being an integral

00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.760
part of the California wine industry getting
started; providing numerous loans to various

00:04:46.760 --> 00:04:51.350
entities in Hollywood in its early days, by
starting the motion-picture loan division,

00:04:51.350 --> 00:04:56.120
which provided loans to many budding Hollywood
groups and individuals including funding Walt

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.270
Disney’s Snow White, when it had gone $2
million over budget; and funded the United

00:05:01.270 --> 00:05:05.810
Artists, which was founded by Charlie Chaplin,
Douglas Fairbanks, and D.W.

00:05:05.810 --> 00:05:06.810
Griffith.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:11.440
He also loaned money to the founders of HP,
William Hewlett and David Packard, to start

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:12.440
their business.

00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:16.120
More significantly, he had his bank purchase
the necessary bonds to fund the construction

00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:17.510
of the Golden Gate Bridge.

00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:22.270
And, of course, the aforementioned integral
role in financing much of the rebuilding of

00:05:22.270 --> 00:05:26.900
San Francisco directly after the earthquake
of 1906, among other things.

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:31.640
By 1930, Giannini had retired once again and
this time moved to Europe.

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.470
However, his successor began running the bank
like traditional banks of the day, only lending

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:39.310
to the wealthy and well established businesses.

00:05:39.310 --> 00:05:43.750
Because of this, Giannini came back to the
United States and rallied various employees

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:48.670
and depositors to him, with them buying shares
in the bank until they owned the controlling

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.670
interest.

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:54.350
He eventually accumulated enough shares owned
by working class citizens, who backed him,

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:58.630
to allow him to regain control of the bank,
at which point, he returned it to its former

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:00.810
ways of lending to the “little man”.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.170
He did not retire again.

00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:08.200
Much like the fictitious George Bailey, Giannini
kept little for himself through all this.

00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:12.440
Despite that fact that the bank he started
was worth billions at the time of his death,

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.160
Giannini’s entire estate was valued at only
$500,000 when he died at the age of 79 in

00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.160
1949.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:23.860
He avoided acquiring great wealth as he felt
it would cause him to lose touch with the

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:24.950
working class.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:28.780
For much of his career, he refused pay for
his work and when the board attempted to give

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.510
him $1.5 million as a bonus one year, he gave
it all away to the University of California

00:06:34.510 --> 00:06:37.840
stating “Money itch is a bad thing.

00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.470
I never had that trouble.”

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:43.330
Bonus Facts:
• After the earthquake, it was reported

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.390
that only 375 people had died as a result
of the quake and the destruction was largely

00:06:48.390 --> 00:06:52.880
downplayed by the media, due to the government
feeling that if the true numbers and level

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:57.720
of destruction was reported, the city might
struggle to re-build, with most of its citizens

00:06:57.720 --> 00:06:59.070
moving away.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:04.170
This actually happened to a certain extent,
with many in San Francisco moving to Los Angeles.

00:07:04.170 --> 00:07:10.690
This resulted in the end of San Francisco
as the dominate city in California.

00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:13.950
• Interestingly, many of the fires after
the earthquake were started by firefighters

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:15.730
and citizens on purpose.

00:07:15.730 --> 00:07:20.140
The firefighters were attempting to use dynamite
to demolish buildings to create firebreaks,

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:24.660
but were untrained to do so and generally
just started more fires as a result of their

00:07:24.660 --> 00:07:25.660
efforts.

00:07:25.660 --> 00:07:30.480
It’s estimated that these fires resulted
in about 50% of the fire damage to the city.

00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.410
Further, most insurance policies at the time
did not cover earthquake damage, but did cover

00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:40.350
fire damage, so many citizens saw to it that
their homes damaged by the earthquake burned

00:07:40.350 --> 00:07:42.510
down.

00:07:42.510 --> 00:07:48.940
• In 2010, Bank of America was forced to
pay $137.7 million after they were accused

00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:53.980
by the federal government of defrauding schools,
hospitals, and various state and local government

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.030
organizations by illegal investment practices.

00:07:57.030 --> 00:08:12.870
Presumably, Giannini is rolling in his grave
right about now.
