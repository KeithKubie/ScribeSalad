JULIE WISKIRCHEN: Hello,
everybody.

00:00:01.260 --> 00:00:02.870
I'm Julie Wiskirchen from the

00:00:02.870 --> 00:00:04.970
Authors@Google team in Los Angeles.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.460
And today, we're excited to
welcome Brant Cooper and

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:10.250
Patrick Vlaskovits.

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.780
And they're going to be
discussing their new book,

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.900
"The Lean Entrepreneur."

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.870
Brant Cooper travels the world
speaking to entrepreneurs and

00:00:16.870 --> 00:00:19.210
consulting and advising
startups.

00:00:19.210 --> 00:00:23.620
His clients include Qualcomm,
MOGL, HubKick, MotherKnows,

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:27.510
i.TV, Lean Startup Machine,
Discovr, and many others.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.340
He has over 20 years experience
in IT and a long

00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:33.570
track record of bringing high
tech products to market.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:35.020
Patrick Vlaskovits is an

00:00:35.020 --> 00:00:37.800
entrepreneur, mentor, and author.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.410
He's founded two startups,
serves as CMO at Drumbi, and

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:43.480
co-wrote "The Entrepreneur's
Guide to Customer

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:44.350
Development--

00:00:44.350 --> 00:00:47.450
A Cheat Sheet to The Four
Steps to the Epiphany."

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:49.540
Patrick has spoken at tech
conferences nationally and

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:53.050
internationally and serves as a
mentor for the 500 Startups

00:00:53.050 --> 00:00:54.820
and for The Lean Startup
Machine.

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:57.380
So please join me in welcoming
Brant and Patrick.

00:00:57.380 --> 00:01:00.880
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:03.142
BRANT COOPER: Thanks
for having us here.

00:01:03.142 --> 00:01:04.370
It's great to be here.

00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.120
We want to make this really
super interactive.

00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:09.760
We've got a presentation around
the challenges of doing

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:12.180
lean startup type stuff inside
of large successful

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.430
organizations.

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:17.670
So I'm not sure we've been
to a large successful

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.280
organization that's also
traditionally very innovative

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.970
like Google.

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.450
So we'd love to actually have a
discussion about some of the

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.150
things that you're seeing inside
of Google-- what's

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:29.510
working, what's maybe
not working.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:33.460
Here's our book.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.760
You all get a copy, I believe.

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:37.580
So what's sort of the backdrop
of this stuff?

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:38.880
Do you want to kick this off?

00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:43.350
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Sure, so the
fundamental premise behind

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:45.750
the book, and why we think the
book is important and timely

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.640
right now, is that there is
a fundamental shift change

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.090
happening in our economy,
and probably globally.

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.550
You've probably heard the
expression by Marc Andreessen,

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.270
the venture capitalist--
software is eating the world.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:04.280
We buy into this or subscribe to
this vision and this idea.

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.480
And what this means is
big things, right?

00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:10.970
So I actually think we're
in this sort of perma

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:13.780
non-economic recovery.

00:02:13.780 --> 00:02:16.900
We're seeing technological
unemployment, big problems,

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:18.640
the middle class is being
hollowed out.

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:21.420
Personally, I don't think either
side of the political

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.790
aisle knows what's
really going on.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.300
It is a big problem, right?

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.100
We're all feeling that
traditional economic solutions

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:31.300
don't seem to be working.

00:02:31.300 --> 00:02:33.660
And this is the state
of the economy.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:35.230
This is one reason why you're
seeing this explosion of

00:02:35.230 --> 00:02:38.100
startups, right?

00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:40.400
You didn't see articles about
startups in the "Wall Street

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.140
Journal" every day.

00:02:41.140 --> 00:02:43.682
And the other day my wife asked
me, has the "Wall Street

00:02:43.682 --> 00:02:45.740
Journal" always been writing
about startups?

00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:46.560
Five years ago, they weren't.

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:47.650
Yeah, once in a while
they'd mention it,

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:48.860
et cetera, et cetera.

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:53.560
But now, this explosion of
startups is sort of a response

00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.350
to this really screwed
up economy that we

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.520
happen to be in.

00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:58.560
BRANT COOPER: And it's
global as well.

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:02.440
So we're lucky enough to travel
the world and talk to

00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:05.760
people that are graduating from
schools in Kuala Lumpur,

00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.630
Malaysia, and Ireland,
and Spain.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:11.500
And all of these people are
assuming that what they're

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:13.890
going to do is start
a business.

00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:15.320
And maybe it's because
it's the only

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:17.120
opportunity that they have.

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:18.340
But that's one side
of the equation.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:22.920
There's also, as you all know,
it's the global connectivity,

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.370
the fact that we're holding
computers in our pockets.

00:03:25.370 --> 00:03:27.710
It's crowdsourcing,
it's crowdfunding.

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:32.070
It's the idea that we buy books
from software companies,

00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.090
we buy movies from software
companies.

00:03:34.090 --> 00:03:41.100
We do shopping exclusively
related to software companies.

00:03:41.100 --> 00:03:43.960
All existing product companies
also have software throughout

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:44.700
their company, right?

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:46.780
So this is the software
eating the world.

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:50.700
It's interesting if you talk
to hardware people.

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:54.380
They're saying that we're at the
same stage as open source

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:57.020
software-- we're in the same
stage in open source hardware

00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.820
as we were in the late '70s
around the time of the Apple I

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:02.160
or the Apple II.

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.000
And if you think about the
amount of change that went on

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.140
in the software in the last
25, 30 years, it's pretty

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:10.370
amazing to think about what the
next decade might bring in

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:12.440
terms of open source hardware.

00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:19.769
Has anybody seen the photo
booths in Japan?

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:21.959
Traditionally, you'd go to
a carnival or whatever,

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:24.560
amusement park, and you've got
the photo booths, and you go

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:25.340
in there with your friends.

00:04:25.340 --> 00:04:27.370
And you're all being all goofy
and making funny expressions.

00:04:27.370 --> 00:04:30.110
And you get a strip of
film out, right?

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:34.590
In Japan, you get 3D printed
figurines with

00:04:34.590 --> 00:04:35.840
your face on it.

00:04:37.916 --> 00:04:43.300
There's a shoe executive at
a Forward Conference says,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:46.075
within two years, you'll be able
to print out your shoes.

00:04:46.075 --> 00:04:51.766
So you'll just be downloading a
shoe style and print it out.

00:04:51.766 --> 00:04:54.630
A movie executive says, oh, well
you guys now are going to

00:04:54.630 --> 00:04:59.370
figure out what software
piracy's all about.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:00.850
It's actually kind of an
interesting idea, right?

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.700
The joke is on the movie
industry, if you ask me

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:04.580
though, because they haven't
figured out what their

00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.490
business model is.

00:05:06.490 --> 00:05:09.300
So anyway, massive amounts
of change--

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.810
wow, is this thing--
there we go.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:14.120
So all sorts of volatility,
uncertainty,

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.730
opportunity, right?

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.090
So massive changes in the world
happening-- structural

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:20.500
changes, people wondering what
they're going to be doing,

00:05:20.500 --> 00:05:22.510
people graduating from college
wondering what jobs they're

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:24.760
going to have.

00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.750
We believe that this is the
right opportunity for being

00:05:29.750 --> 00:05:33.950
fast, agile, and being close
to your customer.

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.700
We think we're moving away
from an economy that's

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:42.710
concentrating on purely wealth
creation and going towards

00:05:42.710 --> 00:05:43.990
value creation.

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:46.810
And so that the winners are
the people that understand

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:51.640
their customers deeply.

00:05:51.640 --> 00:05:57.665
So why don't you give the
Scott Summit example.

00:05:57.665 --> 00:06:00.070
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Sure, so in
the book, there's actually

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.365
a few case studies, more
than two dozen.

00:06:02.365 --> 00:06:05.460
And one of most interesting we
thought was the case study of

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.635
a guy named Scott Summit.

00:06:06.635 --> 00:06:10.215
Scott's an industrial designer,
and he's been doing

00:06:10.215 --> 00:06:13.180
some pretty innovative stuff
in terms of 3D printing for

00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:14.430
prostheses.

00:06:14.430 --> 00:06:17.660
So people come, usually amputees
missing a limb,

00:06:17.660 --> 00:06:21.810
usually a lower limb, and they
go to Scott to get new

00:06:21.810 --> 00:06:22.640
prosthetics.

00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:26.190
And traditionally, what a person
in this situation would

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:29.770
do is they would go and get a
mass manufactured limb, often

00:06:29.770 --> 00:06:32.840
made in Asia, sort of a
rudimentary simple pipe-type

00:06:32.840 --> 00:06:33.790
device, right?

00:06:33.790 --> 00:06:35.460
And they fasten it on.

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:38.050
And then they make sure to put
their jeans over the device,

00:06:38.050 --> 00:06:40.220
over the prosthetic, and
go on with their lives.

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:42.740
BRANT COOPER: They actually will
stuff socks down in there

00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.700
to actually simulate the
shape of a calf.

00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.930
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: So what's
interesting about what Scott's

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:51.820
done, he's done, as I said
earlier, technological

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.940
innovation where he actually
uses 3D scanning technology to

00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:59.060
actually scan the good leg,
then invert it and build a

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:01.020
digital model of the
missing limb.

00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:04.080
And then use 3D printing
technology to print what he

00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:08.220
calls a fairing that mimics the
shape and feel and weight

00:07:08.220 --> 00:07:10.750
of the real missing limb.

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:12.430
And this is actually fascinating
not only because

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:16.810
the technology is sort of the
stuff of magic and science,

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:20.420
but because the actual business
model innovation

00:07:20.420 --> 00:07:24.350
where people now choose these
prosthetic limbs based on who

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:25.420
they are and their
personality.

00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:28.790
So if you're into, let's say,
motorcycles, you may get this

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:31.120
prosthetic limb, and it
may have chrome on it.

00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:33.500
If you're into tattoos, you
may get your tattoo

00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.590
replicated on there.

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:36.890
And what happens is, people's
behavior actually changes.

00:07:36.890 --> 00:07:42.070
They no longer hide
their limbs.

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:43.090
They actually show them off.

00:07:43.090 --> 00:07:47.230
They actually buy dresses
to match the prosthetic.

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:50.190
And this is sort of what we
think is paragon of this new

00:07:50.190 --> 00:07:52.490
value creation economy that
we're seeing emerge out of

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.660
this volatility is someone--

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:56.630
entrepreneurs or large
businesses--

00:07:56.630 --> 00:07:59.450
who really deeply understand
their customers on a very

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:02.460
deep, emotional, perhaps even
psychic level about the

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:05.950
customer's needs, and then
innovate both technologically

00:08:05.950 --> 00:08:08.050
as well as in the actual
business model.

00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.380
BRANT COOPER: So again, the
lean startup for the win--

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:16.630
fast, agile, tenacious, being
close to your customer,

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:20.120
continuously creating
new value.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.340
So how do we do this?

00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:24.980
The backdrop of this is what we
talk about in the book as

00:08:24.980 --> 00:08:26.100
the innovation spectrum.

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.510
So if you've read Clayton
Christensen's "Innovator's

00:08:28.510 --> 00:08:32.250
Dilemma," he uses the term
destructive technology on one

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:36.159
side, sustaining technology
on the other.

00:08:36.159 --> 00:08:38.100
We believe this is
a continuum.

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.390
All companies live on
here somewhere.

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:42.289
PATRICK VLASKOVITS:
So like Brant

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.660
said, this is a continuum.

00:08:44.660 --> 00:08:46.860
And there are distinct shades
of gray, but we're going to

00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.480
contrast this with two
extreme poles.

00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:52.330
So over here on the side, we
have sustaining innovation.

00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:56.930
This is a car manufacturer,
automobile manufacturer coming

00:08:56.930 --> 00:08:58.620
out with a new body
style, right?

00:08:58.620 --> 00:08:59.670
So I have a 4Runner.

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:01.220
I think it's a 2006.

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:03.180
This is the 2008 4Runner--

00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:03.910
incrementally better.

00:09:03.910 --> 00:09:05.570
On some, it's got
a bigger engine.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.350
It's more fuel efficient.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:08.820
Perhaps it's lighter, right?

00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:11.770
Or this is Gillette razors
coming out-- you've got 19

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:12.810
blades on your razor.

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.380
This year, it's got 27--

00:09:14.380 --> 00:09:16.820
some incremental improvement.

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.910
What happens over here is,
generally speaking, the

00:09:20.910 --> 00:09:23.220
problem's well understood, the
market's well understood, the

00:09:23.220 --> 00:09:25.650
customers are well understood,
the sales and marketing

00:09:25.650 --> 00:09:27.320
channels are well understood,
right?

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:29.520
Here, you have execution risk.

00:09:29.520 --> 00:09:32.400
And here what we would say in
the way we look at the world,

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.790
traditional business methods
are sufficient, right?

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:36.620
So you can go and write
a business plan--

00:09:36.620 --> 00:09:39.560
I'm going to now produce
a razor blade that has

00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:40.690
35 blades on it.

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.000
And I'm going to sell to guys
like Reggie over here.

00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:43.760
I know where they live.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.620
I know how much money
they make.

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:49.400
I know why they like my razor
versus the Schick razor.

00:09:49.400 --> 00:09:51.330
And you can go and execute
on that thing.

00:09:51.330 --> 00:09:54.890
That's how we describe
sustaining innovation.

00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:58.100
BRANT COOPER: So disruptive
innovation then is completely

00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.690
turning a market
on its head, or

00:09:59.690 --> 00:10:00.940
creating a brand new market.

00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:04.740
Market's not understood.

00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:05.800
It's not known--

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:08.110
problem unknown, solution
unknown.

00:10:08.110 --> 00:10:09.020
New technology--

00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.780
how do we apply it?

00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:13.230
You go and you to talk
to your customers.

00:10:13.230 --> 00:10:15.970
They actually don't
understand.

00:10:15.970 --> 00:10:18.260
You can't believe what
they're going to say.

00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:19.700
Over on this side, you
ask your customers,

00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.660
would you buy this?

00:10:21.660 --> 00:10:24.150
You cannot take their
answer to the bank.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:28.730
Traditional business methods do
not work so well over here.

00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.050
So Clayton Christensen, in
"Innovator's Dilemma," uses

00:10:31.050 --> 00:10:34.710
hard drives as an example,
so tons of data

00:10:34.710 --> 00:10:36.320
on hard drive companies.

00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:40.160
Back in the '90s, five and a
quarter inch drives held 10

00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.890
megabytes of data.

00:10:41.890 --> 00:10:44.450
Companies would do
real innovation--

00:10:44.450 --> 00:10:47.820
new materials, processes,
double the capacity, 20

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.270
megabyte hard drive.

00:10:49.270 --> 00:10:51.040
Sustaining innovation.

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:54.190
Go out to your IT manager that
bought your 10 megabyte hard

00:10:54.190 --> 00:10:58.080
drive, and you say, hey, you
want to double the capacity

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:00.360
here, same cost, maybe even
a little bit less?

00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:02.241
Do you want it?

00:11:02.241 --> 00:11:05.260
IT manager goes, yeah, of
course, that's awesome.

00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:07.166
Great, when can I have it?

00:11:07.166 --> 00:11:08.760
Oh, you'd pay $150?

00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:12.610
Oh yeah, no problem,
got the budget.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:15.870
You can actually build
great return on

00:11:15.870 --> 00:11:17.010
investment cases here.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:18.200
You know the market.

00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:18.805
You know the customers.

00:11:18.805 --> 00:11:20.580
You know how much they'll pay.

00:11:20.580 --> 00:11:23.280
You can predict the success of
that company or that product

00:11:23.280 --> 00:11:23.810
fairly well.

00:11:23.810 --> 00:11:26.010
You've got competition.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:27.610
You're fighting your
competition there?

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:31.600
Patrick likes to say over on
this side, you die because

00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.840
your competitors have stabbed
you in the back, and they're

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:36.600
dancing on your grave.

00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.790
Over here--

00:11:37.790 --> 00:11:39.430
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: You're out
in the wilderness, die alone,

00:11:39.430 --> 00:11:44.740
you starve to death, and nobody
even knew you existed.

00:11:44.740 --> 00:11:46.120
BRANT COOPER: This
is traditionally

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.940
where startups live.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:51.050
And your big businesses
do your sustaining

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.280
innovation very well.

00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.330
Over on the startup side, you're
a new company and you

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:57.385
produce a three and
a half inch drive.

00:11:57.385 --> 00:11:59.550
It holds 20 megabytes of data.

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:02.850
You go bring that same IT to
that same IT guy, that three

00:12:02.850 --> 00:12:05.380
and a half inch drive, he thinks
it's a paperweight.

00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:07.240
Has no idea what it's for.

00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:10.590
Has no use for it.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.800
So big businesses do
the sustaining

00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.970
innovation very well.

00:12:14.970 --> 00:12:16.770
It's not a pejorative.

00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:18.090
This is where market share is.

00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:19.810
It's where margins are.

00:12:19.810 --> 00:12:22.136
It's where the large
market is.

00:12:22.136 --> 00:12:24.150
This disruptive side
is all brand new.

00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.990
You don't know if there's
a market there yet.

00:12:26.990 --> 00:12:31.340
Most startups exist somewhere
in between.

00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.310
Most startups really aren't
all the way over on the

00:12:33.310 --> 00:12:34.000
disruptive side.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:36.060
They're somewhere in between.

00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:39.150
But the point really is that
the practices that you use

00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:42.670
when you're experimenting or
you're interacting with your

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:47.770
customers differ based upon
where you are on the spectrum.

00:12:47.770 --> 00:12:49.770
Over here, you can't believe
what the customers say.

00:12:49.770 --> 00:12:52.280
Over there, eh, if you're really
over on the sustaining

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:53.030
side, you can understand.

00:12:53.030 --> 00:12:55.260
You can believe what they say.

00:12:55.260 --> 00:12:58.140
Over here, you're optimized
for learning.

00:12:58.140 --> 00:13:00.330
On that side, you're optimized
for execution.

00:13:00.330 --> 00:13:04.230
You've already learned how to
figure out products, features,

00:13:04.230 --> 00:13:07.130
marketing, sales.

00:13:07.130 --> 00:13:08.890
So there's actually some
things to think

00:13:08.890 --> 00:13:09.660
about there, right?

00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:13.410
I mean, in terms of human
resources, for example, over

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.370
here, you need people that are
willing to wear, like to wear

00:13:17.370 --> 00:13:19.610
many hats, tend to like chaos.

00:13:19.610 --> 00:13:24.830
Over on this side, they like
order-- in box and out box.

00:13:24.830 --> 00:13:27.670
So we'll dive into that
a little bit more.

00:13:27.670 --> 00:13:28.930
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: One thing
to note too is, I actually

00:13:28.930 --> 00:13:30.540
have a theory on this
disruptive side.

00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:33.730
If you're doing something really
disruptive, my theory

00:13:33.730 --> 00:13:35.720
is that your sales and marketing
channels, you have

00:13:35.720 --> 00:13:37.830
to actually innovate
on those, too.

00:13:37.830 --> 00:13:40.080
So if you're doing something
fundamentally disruptive, and

00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:42.380
you're taking best practices--

00:13:42.380 --> 00:13:44.840
best practices are on
this side, right?

00:13:44.840 --> 00:13:45.720
Best practices is sort of

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:47.450
execution-oriented risk, right?

00:13:47.450 --> 00:13:49.340
But if you're doing something
crazy disruptive--

00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:51.750
maybe like Google Glass,
for the example--

00:13:51.750 --> 00:13:55.120
if you actually follow
sustaining innovation type

00:13:55.120 --> 00:13:56.790
sales and marketing channels,
you're probably

00:13:56.790 --> 00:13:58.236
not going to win.

00:13:58.236 --> 00:13:59.960
BRANT COOPER: So how do you
disrupt inside of a large,

00:13:59.960 --> 00:14:01.170
successful organization?

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:05.050
So this is the innovator's
dilemma.

00:14:05.050 --> 00:14:07.410
Inside of most large
businesses,

00:14:07.410 --> 00:14:09.430
innovation is a buzzword.

00:14:09.430 --> 00:14:12.210
You can find it right
on their About page.

00:14:12.210 --> 00:14:15.660
We are the most innovative
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:14:15.660 --> 00:14:18.910
You see it in their
advertisements, right?

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:22.800
The sustaining innovation
SUV that

00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:24.840
Patrick was talking about--

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.370
I can't remember
what car it is.

00:14:26.370 --> 00:14:29.640
It might be actually Mercedes
where the patents are flying

00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:30.340
off of the car.

00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.920
And this is the sign of their
innovation is how many patents

00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:34.060
that they have.

00:14:34.060 --> 00:14:37.370
And it's all on a vehicle that
is sort of marginally improved

00:14:37.370 --> 00:14:39.670
from the year before.

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:42.140
So big business talks
about innovation.

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:43.950
But most big businesses, when
they're talking about

00:14:43.950 --> 00:14:47.380
innovation, they're talking
about sustaining innovation.

00:14:47.380 --> 00:14:49.190
They're talking about
incrementally improving

00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:52.830
products, product lines, inside
of a known market.

00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:56.590
And there's good
reason for it.

00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:58.360
Again, margins are good,
market's are known.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:01.990
So you can actually measure what
you think the return is

00:15:01.990 --> 00:15:04.060
going to be on your endeavors.

00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:08.260
So if you own the purse strings
inside of a large

00:15:08.260 --> 00:15:13.090
organization and somebody comes
to you and says, hey,

00:15:13.090 --> 00:15:16.200
I've got this great idea, here's
the market we're going

00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:18.600
to sell to, here's what our
profit margin is, I think that

00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:20.310
we should be able to get
this sort of return

00:15:20.310 --> 00:15:21.880
within a couple years.

00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.930
Versus the crazy startup guy
who goes, oh, I got this

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:31.100
really wacky idea, but he has
no idea what the market is,

00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:32.880
whether he could sell to it.

00:15:32.880 --> 00:15:35.240
If you're in charge of your
business unit, if you've got

00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:38.310
the purse strings, which one
are you going to invest in?

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:41.530
Clearly, you're going to invest
rationally in the

00:15:41.530 --> 00:15:42.430
existing market.

00:15:42.430 --> 00:15:46.380
So that is the innovator's
dilemma.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:49.880
Two questions that kill
disruptive innovation--

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:53.790
what's my ROI, and when
am I going to see it?

00:15:53.790 --> 00:15:57.050
The only way you can answer that
question is to look at

00:15:57.050 --> 00:15:58.860
existing markets.

00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:01.750
So you're pulled over to
the sustaining side.

00:16:01.750 --> 00:16:04.120
And we see this all across the
world when we're going and

00:16:04.120 --> 00:16:05.620
talking to intrapreneurs--

00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.210
entrepreneurs inside of these
large businesses.

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:10.790
They've actually been charged
with going out and doing quote

00:16:10.790 --> 00:16:13.960
unquote "real innovation." And
yet, they come back, and their

00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:15.940
business managers say, OK,
well what's the return on

00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.370
investment?

00:16:18.370 --> 00:16:21.890
It's the equivalent of writing
a business plan, which nobody

00:16:21.890 --> 00:16:23.820
does in startups
anymore, right?

00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:26.880
So back to that spectrum--

00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.130
sustaining side, you can write
a business plan that's

00:16:29.130 --> 00:16:31.050
believable.

00:16:31.050 --> 00:16:33.520
Disruptive side--

00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:37.030
business plans are just pulled
out of thin air, right?

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:40.060
Over on the sustaining side,
if you have your requisite

00:16:40.060 --> 00:16:44.880
hockey stick revenues, it's
based on real data.

00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:46.590
On the disruptive side--

00:16:46.590 --> 00:16:48.020
completely made up.

00:16:48.020 --> 00:16:50.140
It's like an inverse mullet.

00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:52.620
Just draw it so it's business
in the front,

00:16:52.620 --> 00:16:56.140
party in the back.

00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.445
So we see this all over--
when is the ROI?

00:17:02.086 --> 00:17:04.950
For traditional corporates,
when we're doing this in a

00:17:04.950 --> 00:17:07.589
workshop, this is actually where
Patrick and I have to

00:17:07.589 --> 00:17:11.540
pause, because on the opposite
side of the room, there'll be

00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:15.630
a PM and her boss.

00:17:15.630 --> 00:17:17.329
And they'll just sort of lean
across, and they'll start

00:17:17.329 --> 00:17:21.180
talking to each other about the
mistake they made in terms

00:17:21.180 --> 00:17:25.230
of these questions
being asked.

00:17:25.230 --> 00:17:28.069
So how do we get beyond that?

00:17:28.069 --> 00:17:31.690
Here are some of the typical
approaches to innovation.

00:17:31.690 --> 00:17:35.830
You go hire Big Four, Big Five,
however many consulting

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:37.120
firms are left of
the big guys.

00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:39.230
You go hire those guys,
and they talk about--

00:17:39.230 --> 00:17:40.990
they come and they do rally.

00:17:40.990 --> 00:17:43.930
Instead of Patrick and I
standing up here, it'll be a

00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:47.390
management guru and will just
fire you up and inspire you to

00:17:47.390 --> 00:17:51.670
go and be innovative, go be
internal visionaries.

00:17:51.670 --> 00:17:53.030
Patrick and I's version
of that is

00:17:53.030 --> 00:17:55.020
the myth of the visionary.

00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:58.880
The other thing big businesses
do is they create these labs.

00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:02.050
And they have these brilliant
people working in these labs

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:04.520
tinkering with new technology.

00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:07.110
And yet, that technology never
sees the light of day.

00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:10.330
Usually, it's because somebody
goes waltzing through there

00:18:10.330 --> 00:18:13.650
and goes, oh yeah, that one's
good, meh, that's not so good.

00:18:13.650 --> 00:18:15.060
Sort of this pick a
winner strategy.

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:16.850
And they take this technology,
and they throw it over the

00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:18.730
transom to the core business.

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:22.460
And then they sort of wonder
why that product fails.

00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.620
It doesn't work.

00:18:24.620 --> 00:18:28.520
So then there's the management
team that sits around.

00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:29.750
I've sat on this
management team

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:32.260
before in smaller companies.

00:18:32.260 --> 00:18:35.760
And again, you sort of go, oh,
we're going to give $250,000

00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:37.370
to this group, and nobody
else gets any.

00:18:37.370 --> 00:18:41.460
They make this one big bet
on an internal startup.

00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:46.360
And like most startups,
it's likely to fail.

00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.710
And so there's their one shot,
and they go, oh god, this

00:18:48.710 --> 00:18:51.120
stuff doesn't work.

00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.635
Other ones try to turn core
business into a startup.

00:18:54.635 --> 00:18:58.650
And that's a great way to
kill your core business.

00:18:58.650 --> 00:19:01.030
And then finally, there's the
build a startup inside the

00:19:01.030 --> 00:19:02.990
core business.

00:19:02.990 --> 00:19:06.640
And so what we see here,
there's some benefits.

00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:09.000
You get entrepreneurial spirit,
this culture of

00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:16.600
experimentation, optimized for
learning, lots of chaos, Nerf

00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.310
guns, super cool, right?

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:22.320
If you try to do this inside
of a large enterprise, then

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:25.180
you've got some problems.

00:19:25.180 --> 00:19:27.190
Large businesses got
large because they

00:19:27.190 --> 00:19:29.460
learned how to execute.

00:19:29.460 --> 00:19:33.700
If you kill that because you
want to be startup-y, you're

00:19:33.700 --> 00:19:36.410
killing where all your
money's coming from.

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.350
You can't just take a large
organization and

00:19:38.350 --> 00:19:39.600
turn it into a startup.

00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:43.960
You have brand issues.

00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:48.480
You have legal issues,
regulatory issues, often.

00:19:48.480 --> 00:19:51.240
You've got marketing people that
know how to market to a

00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:52.850
particular segment.

00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:57.570
You've got sales people that
need to earn their commissions

00:19:57.570 --> 00:20:00.420
by selling their core
business products.

00:20:00.420 --> 00:20:04.630
You start giving them these
startup products, and it

00:20:04.630 --> 00:20:06.130
creates all sorts of
inefficiencies.

00:20:06.130 --> 00:20:08.610
Nobody's smarter than sales
guys how to optimize their

00:20:08.610 --> 00:20:09.240
commission, right?

00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:11.710
So they start bundling their
products together, bundling

00:20:11.710 --> 00:20:13.260
the new stuff with
the old stuff--

00:20:13.260 --> 00:20:17.800
anything they can do in order
to earn their money.

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:22.050
We were talking to a big company
that actually does

00:20:22.050 --> 00:20:23.800
some of this stuff
pretty well.

00:20:23.800 --> 00:20:26.960
And an internal startup would
reach a certain level, and

00:20:26.960 --> 00:20:30.390
they would throw their core
business support into the

00:20:30.390 --> 00:20:31.090
startup world.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.730
And suddenly, their whole
support organization gets

00:20:33.730 --> 00:20:36.120
sucked into problems
that are emerging

00:20:36.120 --> 00:20:39.170
with this new product.

00:20:39.170 --> 00:20:41.620
So it's not just that the
startup has to be protected

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:42.560
from the big business.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:43.800
The big business actually
has to be

00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:45.980
protected from the startup.

00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:49.500
So what we try to work with some
of these companies is,

00:20:49.500 --> 00:20:52.700
how do you build this lean
startup mentality inside of a

00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:54.110
large business?

00:20:54.110 --> 00:20:57.450
You run multiple experiments,
not a pick a winner strategy.

00:20:57.450 --> 00:21:02.900
You use validated learning to
measure the progress of these

00:21:02.900 --> 00:21:07.250
companies instead
of just revenue.

00:21:07.250 --> 00:21:11.460
We found that this one company,
in particular,

00:21:11.460 --> 00:21:14.870
struggled with the whole
persevere or pivot.

00:21:14.870 --> 00:21:17.280
And I thought it was
really interesting.

00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:23.870
He said, management needs to
actually urge these internal

00:21:23.870 --> 00:21:25.430
startups not to pivot.

00:21:25.430 --> 00:21:27.600
They want to pivot too early.

00:21:27.600 --> 00:21:29.560
The moment there's any trouble,
they want to pivot.

00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.940
And actually, if you can flip
the motivations around so that

00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:36.370
the management is actually
telling them to persevere,

00:21:36.370 --> 00:21:38.740
that they saw bigger
wins that way.

00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:41.130
But you have these different
stages inside of these

00:21:41.130 --> 00:21:43.840
internal startups that are,
again, measured by validated

00:21:43.840 --> 00:21:46.370
learning, not revenue, so
things like number of

00:21:46.370 --> 00:21:51.100
passionate users, viral

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:54.420
coefficient, if that's important.

00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.650
You start learning what the
lifetime value is, cost of

00:21:56.650 --> 00:21:57.380
acquisition.

00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:00.050
You're testing marketing
channels, testing innovation

00:22:00.050 --> 00:22:01.820
of the marketing channels.

00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:04.010
Then you have these stage two
internal startups where they

00:22:04.010 --> 00:22:06.330
have to prove out their
business model.

00:22:06.330 --> 00:22:08.300
What other market segments
can we go after?

00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:09.930
Is it scalable?

00:22:09.930 --> 00:22:13.650
And now you can start
looking at revenue.

00:22:13.650 --> 00:22:18.360
But again, it's really about
the sustainability of this

00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:20.250
startup and whether
it's scalable.

00:22:20.250 --> 00:22:22.570
And you do all of these things,
which can take years

00:22:22.570 --> 00:22:26.650
before you start migrating these
internal startups into

00:22:26.650 --> 00:22:28.130
the core business.

00:22:28.130 --> 00:22:29.306
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Actually,
since we're at Google, we

00:22:29.306 --> 00:22:32.910
should also talk about what I
think-- how Google, at least

00:22:32.910 --> 00:22:34.775
up to now, sort of solves
this problem.

00:22:34.775 --> 00:22:36.140
What I think happens here--

00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:41.280
I'm not a Googler, so I don't
have any inner knowledge.

00:22:41.280 --> 00:22:45.730
But what I think happens at
Google, actually, is that,

00:22:45.730 --> 00:22:47.750
basically, these internal
experiments leave in the form

00:22:47.750 --> 00:22:49.550
of folks leaving to start doing
their own startups, and

00:22:49.550 --> 00:22:51.990
then they get acquired, right?

00:22:51.990 --> 00:22:54.970
So when you get acquired, that's
your bonus for doing

00:22:54.970 --> 00:22:57.670
something innovative, right?

00:22:57.670 --> 00:22:59.030
If that works for Google,
that's fine.

00:22:59.030 --> 00:23:01.080
I don't think that
works for a bunch

00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:02.940
of other large companies.

00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:04.350
Because actually, I think what
you can actually start doing

00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:06.800
is start spawning competitors
very quickly.

00:23:06.800 --> 00:23:10.490
So part of this message is
about how to create these

00:23:10.490 --> 00:23:12.680
internal experiments, internal
startups, is to keep the

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:15.380
innovators in house, keep them
happy, and make sure to

00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:16.840
incentivize them
the right way.

00:23:16.840 --> 00:23:19.060
BRANT COOPER: Or even figuring
out what the application of

00:23:19.060 --> 00:23:19.950
the technology is.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:22.620
If it's just technology that's
being developed, then what is

00:23:22.620 --> 00:23:25.000
the right product out
of that technology?

00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.370
And the way the startup world
figures that out is actually

00:23:28.370 --> 00:23:32.380
going and validating that
there's a product there.

00:23:32.380 --> 00:23:34.700
Whereas if you just have
a lab's approach, they

00:23:34.700 --> 00:23:36.450
typically--

00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:40.670
in my experience, either the
technology never leaves the

00:23:40.670 --> 00:23:43.210
lab, or if it leaves the lab,
it goes straight from lab to

00:23:43.210 --> 00:23:44.950
core business.

00:23:44.950 --> 00:23:46.950
And so somebody's actually
walking through the lab.

00:23:46.950 --> 00:23:49.690
And based upon their own
visionary status, their

00:23:49.690 --> 00:23:52.500
ability to predict
the future--

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:55.310
so it ends up that the managers
then are going, oh, I

00:23:55.310 --> 00:23:56.850
know how to pick winners.

00:23:56.850 --> 00:23:59.330
I'm the highest paid person in
the room, so I'm going to pick

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:01.470
which technology is a winner.

00:24:01.470 --> 00:24:04.610
And then, I pluck it out, put
some money behind it, and go

00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:07.320
throw it to the core business
without actually ever

00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.390
validating whether there's a
market for that technology or

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:14.210
a market for that particular
application of technology.

00:24:14.210 --> 00:24:15.550
Who's the right customer?

00:24:15.550 --> 00:24:17.630
Who's their early adopter?

00:24:17.630 --> 00:24:19.510
How do I market and how do
I sell to those people?

00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:23.380
So that's my experience with the
traditional lab approach.

00:24:23.380 --> 00:24:24.870
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: One pattern
we see quite often is,

00:24:24.870 --> 00:24:27.680
when it gets kicked out of the
lab too early and it gets

00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:29.200
kicked over to the sales folks,
like Brant mentioned

00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:32.430
earlier, the sales folks
go, what is this?

00:24:32.430 --> 00:24:32.995
I'm not sure.

00:24:32.995 --> 00:24:34.220
Do my customers care?

00:24:34.220 --> 00:24:37.640
They're focused on meeting their
target, making sales,

00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:40.020
being the economic engine
of the organization.

00:24:40.020 --> 00:24:43.570
And you've actually given them
another task now, right?

00:24:43.570 --> 00:24:46.060
The difference between selling
something and discovering how

00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.830
to sell something is
not trivial, right?

00:24:49.830 --> 00:24:51.910
Does everyone know what
I'm talk about here?

00:24:51.910 --> 00:24:54.670
There's a fundamental discovery
function that

00:24:54.670 --> 00:24:58.770
happens on the disruptive side
and the execution on the

00:24:58.770 --> 00:24:59.680
sustaining side.

00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:03.770
And we see this over and over
again where great technology

00:25:03.770 --> 00:25:09.980
shoots out of the lab, lands in
the saleswoman's lap, and

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:12.330
she's, again, tasked with
making sales, making

00:25:12.330 --> 00:25:13.780
commissions, not discovering.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.630
And then she'll do things like
bundle it with other products,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:17.230
et cetera, et cetera,
et cetera--

00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:18.790
anything to sort of get
it off the radar.

00:25:18.790 --> 00:25:21.360
And then ultimately, the
product ends up dying.

00:25:21.360 --> 00:25:24.912
AUDIENCE: So does that mean we
can have a lab, but we need to

00:25:24.912 --> 00:25:27.560
have a separate execute
strategy for the lab?

00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:31.040
BRANT COOPER: Right, so
organizations that have labs--

00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:34.050
so we sort of have a three-stage
framework, which

00:25:34.050 --> 00:25:39.210
is internal startup that's
proving customer passion.

00:25:39.210 --> 00:25:41.300
Second stage is proving
the business model.

00:25:41.300 --> 00:25:43.620
Third stage is the
core business.

00:25:43.620 --> 00:25:46.180
Where there's labs, I just think
it's a fourth stage.

00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.190
And that would be sort of stage
zero, which is the lab

00:25:49.190 --> 00:25:51.330
is coming up with
new technology.

00:25:51.330 --> 00:25:55.050
And then you need to find
somebody that wants to take

00:25:55.050 --> 00:25:57.800
that idea and turn it into
an internal startup.

00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:00.590
So you'd go from stage zero
to stage one then.

00:26:00.590 --> 00:26:02.570
So there's nothing wrong
with the labs.

00:26:02.570 --> 00:26:05.900
The problem has been
traditionally what we do with

00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:08.650
the technology that's
inside the labs.

00:26:08.650 --> 00:26:11.110
And super huge companies--

00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.870
Xerox PARC, HP--

00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:17.490
these are companies that had
brilliant technology that

00:26:17.490 --> 00:26:19.570
never saw the light of day.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.130
And really, my belief is--

00:26:22.130 --> 00:26:26.870
I did a startup in the late '90s
that actually crashed at

00:26:26.870 --> 00:26:30.650
the dot com crash, where we
took HP technology out of

00:26:30.650 --> 00:26:32.890
their lab, and we were bringing
it to market.

00:26:32.890 --> 00:26:33.880
And this is what
we would hear.

00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:35.380
We did this tour of HP labs.

00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:38.650
And there's scientists and these
brilliant engineers.

00:26:38.650 --> 00:26:41.580
And they would sit there and go,
yeah, this kind of sucks.

00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:44.160
None of our stuff ever sees
the light of day.

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.850
There was no method of getting
that stuff out.

00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:49.040
So on the flip side--

00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.310
protecting the core business
from the startup--

00:26:51.310 --> 00:26:53.480
you need a set of ground
rules, right?

00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:58.190
So sales and marketing are not
given these startup products.

00:26:58.190 --> 00:27:00.790
Legal comes up with
ground rules.

00:27:00.790 --> 00:27:02.400
So if you're a startup and
you want to do this

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:06.150
experimentation and you follow
these ground rules, then you

00:27:06.150 --> 00:27:08.540
don't have to go to legal
to get approval.

00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:10.850
This is huge, because the whole
idea in the startup

00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:14.590
world is doing experimentation
fast.

00:27:14.590 --> 00:27:18.220
So we've run across
these companies.

00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:19.730
7-Eleven is a great example.

00:27:19.730 --> 00:27:21.640
They actually brought
us in for lean

00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:23.850
startup stuff, 7-Eleven.

00:27:23.850 --> 00:27:26.670
They have an internal structure
responsible for

00:27:26.670 --> 00:27:27.590
experimentation.

00:27:27.590 --> 00:27:30.050
But it took five months to
get the results for one

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:31.220
experiment.

00:27:31.220 --> 00:27:34.980
So imagine you're somebody
inside this large

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:35.580
organization.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:37.860
You want to do something new,
you come up with an

00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:39.960
experiment, give it to
this organization.

00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.390
Five months later, you
get the result.

00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:44.700
Like most results of
experiments, that first

00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:46.280
iteration was a failure.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:47.850
You're all like, eh,
I'm done with this.

00:27:47.850 --> 00:27:48.870
I'm going back to my job.

00:27:48.870 --> 00:27:51.040
You get five months
to get an answer.

00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.000
So the whole point here is to
be able to put together

00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:56.340
processes that allow you
to move quickly.

00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.720
And one of those are, here's
the legal ground rules.

00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.810
Here's the web terms of
service template.

00:28:01.810 --> 00:28:05.290
If you use this, you don't
have to contact us.

00:28:05.290 --> 00:28:07.180
There's all sorts of other
issues, though.

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:13.370
So I mentioned that startups
seem really super sexy.

00:28:13.370 --> 00:28:16.300
So even if you're this
process-oriented person, you

00:28:16.300 --> 00:28:18.730
go, oh, I'm going to go jump
into this startup.

00:28:18.730 --> 00:28:20.290
That actually might
cause a problem.

00:28:20.290 --> 00:28:22.865
So there's some HR issues that
need to be thought of.

00:28:22.865 --> 00:28:24.600
I don't know if HR is
the right place for

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.190
them to come out of.

00:28:26.190 --> 00:28:27.660
But it's important to

00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:29.570
understand, who are the resources?

00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:33.870
If you're in the chaos side, you
want people that thrive in

00:28:33.870 --> 00:28:37.980
that sort of atmosphere versus
the people that thrive on the

00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:41.660
execution side, on the
process-oriented side.

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:46.420
So support staff on core
products only--

00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:48.720
how do you interact with
existing customers?

00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:51.460
So this is a big issue for
a lot of big companies.

00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.730
They don't want their startups
running experiments on their

00:28:53.730 --> 00:28:56.310
millions of customers, right?

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:58.830
So how do you take a sliver of
those customers and run some

00:28:58.830 --> 00:29:00.412
experiments?

00:29:00.412 --> 00:29:02.055
Do you threaten the brand?

00:29:02.055 --> 00:29:05.650
You go and you run an
experiment, and you're

00:29:05.650 --> 00:29:08.550
throwing out in classic minimum
viable product.

00:29:08.550 --> 00:29:11.560
You throw out some
crappy product.

00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.310
It didn't quite reach viable.

00:29:14.310 --> 00:29:16.220
You want that associated
with your brand?

00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:17.130
Maybe not.

00:29:17.130 --> 00:29:20.520
So you create a lab's brand, or
a fake brand, and really do

00:29:20.520 --> 00:29:24.570
this experimentation under
this fake brand.

00:29:24.570 --> 00:29:28.340
So there's all sorts of ways
that, if it's thought through,

00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.290
the core business can actually
be protected from the startup.

00:29:31.290 --> 00:29:32.170
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: And this
is something I think Google

00:29:32.170 --> 00:29:33.370
has historically done
very well, right?

00:29:33.370 --> 00:29:38.700
Google Labs has certainly had
a few really interesting

00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.760
experimental products, right?

00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:45.890
BRANT COOPER: So assuming one
buys all into this, and we're

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:49.370
going to build lean startups
inside of an organization, I'd

00:29:49.370 --> 00:29:52.620
like to take a quick step back
and sort of give the

00:29:52.620 --> 00:29:55.980
background on how our take
is on how this lean

00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:58.050
startup stuff evolved.

00:29:58.050 --> 00:30:00.670
So hopefully by now, we
all know that lean

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.145
does not mean cheap.

00:30:02.145 --> 00:30:03.860
It doesn't mean small.

00:30:03.860 --> 00:30:07.800
It doesn't mean don't spend
money or don't raise money.

00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:10.310
Lean comes from lean
manufacturing, which describes

00:30:10.310 --> 00:30:15.240
the way Toyota was building
cars in Japan in the '50s.

00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:19.580
So lean is all about the
elimination of waste, right?

00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.820
So in the manufacturing sense,
you had a known product, known

00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:25.510
problem, known solution.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:30.770
I'm building a car, maybe a
minivan for a soccer mom.

00:30:30.770 --> 00:30:34.230
And so I have what's called
value add activities.

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:37.880
I'm actually assembling
the car.

00:30:37.880 --> 00:30:40.090
And then I have not value add
activities, which might be,

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:42.580
I'm forklifting parts
from one side of the

00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.290
warehouse to the other.

00:30:44.290 --> 00:30:46.420
It doesn't actually contribute
to the value

00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:48.690
that's being created.

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:52.590
So in lean manufacturing, what
you try to do is make as

00:30:52.590 --> 00:30:55.200
efficient as possible the
value add activities and

00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.990
eliminate as many of
the non-value add

00:30:57.990 --> 00:30:59.490
activities as possible.

00:30:59.490 --> 00:31:02.370
Some are necessary, but you
try to eliminate them.

00:31:02.370 --> 00:31:06.050
So in lean manufacturing, there
are these concepts of

00:31:06.050 --> 00:31:10.060
flow and pull, and basically
that's starting

00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.200
with customer demand.

00:31:11.200 --> 00:31:16.800
You only built parts and product
as the downstream

00:31:16.800 --> 00:31:20.670
process demanded the part from
you or the process from you.

00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.680
So it created this one piece
flow, so each car was actually

00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:30.730
made in whole before the next,
all based upon demand, OK?

00:31:30.730 --> 00:31:37.670
So that started eliminating
things like space required for

00:31:37.670 --> 00:31:39.670
parts, for inventory.

00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:44.080
Because you only made
what was demanded.

00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:46.150
So that was a way that they
could then start eliminating

00:31:46.150 --> 00:31:47.625
some of these non-value
add activities.

00:31:50.410 --> 00:31:55.640
So in a lean startup, the
difference is, you don't

00:31:55.640 --> 00:31:57.910
actually know the value
that you're creating.

00:31:57.910 --> 00:31:59.740
And you don't know for whom.

00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:02.130
So you think you know, right?

00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:06.230
You have a business plan that
has documented all that you

00:32:06.230 --> 00:32:09.120
think that you know.

00:32:09.120 --> 00:32:11.560
But until the transaction
actually happens in the

00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.470
marketplace, you don't truly
know, not until somebody has

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:19.220
paid you some sort of
currency for the

00:32:19.220 --> 00:32:21.450
value that you're creating.

00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:23.130
Now I know, right?

00:32:23.130 --> 00:32:27.140
At least I'm starting
to begin to know.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.090
So it sort of begs the question
though, if you don't

00:32:29.090 --> 00:32:30.900
know the value that you're
creating, and you don't know

00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:33.350
for whom, how do you know
what activities

00:32:33.350 --> 00:32:34.650
are wasteful or not?

00:32:34.650 --> 00:32:36.940
How do you know how to eliminate
non-value add

00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:38.260
activities?

00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.910
So Eric Reese talks about
validating learning.

00:32:41.910 --> 00:32:43.360
So if you're not learning--

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:45.820
if you're in a state
of unknown--

00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:47.660
if you're not learning,
you're wasting.

00:32:51.050 --> 00:32:53.980
And so the lean startup would
try to use a set of principles

00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:58.190
that allow us to learn,
continuously learn.

00:32:58.190 --> 00:33:00.280
Now, it's important to
understand that once you

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:03.270
learn, then you execute,
right?

00:33:03.270 --> 00:33:06.790
So this is the path from
sustaining innovation, or from

00:33:06.790 --> 00:33:09.000
disruptive innovation
to sustaining.

00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:11.380
You start out in a
state of unknown.

00:33:11.380 --> 00:33:13.460
You're running experiments,
interacting with your

00:33:13.460 --> 00:33:15.670
customers in a particular
way in order to

00:33:15.670 --> 00:33:17.870
learn, in order to know.

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:21.990
And as you know, you execute
while continuing to learn

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:23.240
what's still unknown.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:31.860
So people sort of get this stuck
in their head that they

00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:35.740
always need to be creating
minimum viable products.

00:33:35.740 --> 00:33:39.390
Well actually, once you've
learned what's viable, and

00:33:39.390 --> 00:33:41.440
that there's a market
segment, now you've

00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.840
got to start executing.

00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:45.960
We're not always in MVP mode.

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:50.770
We're in MVP mode in order to
learn upon what to execute.

00:33:50.770 --> 00:33:53.110
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: And in fact,
when we were talking

00:33:53.110 --> 00:33:57.730
about the innovation spectrum,
if you're doing an MVP on the

00:33:57.730 --> 00:33:59.305
sustaining side, you're
doing it wrong, right?

00:33:59.305 --> 00:34:01.820
The context is there, the
market is there, the

00:34:01.820 --> 00:34:02.410
customer's there.

00:34:02.410 --> 00:34:03.185
All the things are known.

00:34:03.185 --> 00:34:05.470
You don't want an MVP, you
actually want a whole product

00:34:05.470 --> 00:34:07.450
over there, right?

00:34:07.450 --> 00:34:09.270
So we've sometimes run into
stuff like, oh, I'm doing the

00:34:09.270 --> 00:34:13.380
MVP, and basically, they're
ripping off some known

00:34:13.380 --> 00:34:14.570
product, right?

00:34:14.570 --> 00:34:16.080
MVPs aren't helpful.

00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:18.050
MVPs are helpful as experiments
on the disruptive

00:34:18.050 --> 00:34:18.719
side, right?

00:34:18.719 --> 00:34:21.750
They're trying to actually
derive knowledge out of this

00:34:21.750 --> 00:34:23.710
sort of unknown chaotic space.

00:34:23.710 --> 00:34:26.130
BRANT COOPER: So the way we
help some startups, some

00:34:26.130 --> 00:34:30.300
organizations large and small,
think through the learning

00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.630
process is what we
call the value

00:34:33.630 --> 00:34:34.949
stream discovery exercise.

00:34:34.949 --> 00:34:37.960
So again, the value stream
is comprised of all the

00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:41.850
activities that a business goes
through in order to make

00:34:41.850 --> 00:34:43.800
a customer first aware,
all the way to

00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:45.430
delivering the value.

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:49.360
And anything in between is the
discovery of the value.

00:34:49.360 --> 00:34:54.670
So we have this model where we
look at seven states that a

00:34:54.670 --> 00:34:57.740
customer goes through, emotional
states from a

00:34:57.740 --> 00:35:01.160
buyer's perspective, from a
customer's perspective, the

00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.950
states that they go through.

00:35:02.950 --> 00:35:05.510
And then, what we look at are,
what are the four things we

00:35:05.510 --> 00:35:07.640
can look at through
each state?

00:35:07.640 --> 00:35:10.130
What does the company do to
get the customer to this

00:35:10.130 --> 00:35:11.530
particular state?

00:35:11.530 --> 00:35:13.160
What is the impact
on the customers?

00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.340
So why do they believe they
are in this state?

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.460
Why are they feeling this way?

00:35:17.460 --> 00:35:20.110
What action do I take
as a customer when I

00:35:20.110 --> 00:35:22.350
achieve this state?

00:35:22.350 --> 00:35:25.700
And how do I measure
that action?

00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:28.030
And if one can discover that for
their whole product, then

00:35:28.030 --> 00:35:31.320
what you've got is your growth
engine, minimum viable

00:35:31.320 --> 00:35:35.140
product, this magic moment of
conversion where somebody is

00:35:35.140 --> 00:35:39.365
willing to pay or maybe sign up,
the marketing funnel, and

00:35:39.365 --> 00:35:41.420
then your acquisition
channels.

00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:45.320
So you have a set of hypotheses
that cover what we

00:35:45.320 --> 00:35:47.360
call the startup model.

00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:51.310
So like Steve Blank likes to
say, startup is not a small

00:35:51.310 --> 00:35:53.110
version of a big company.

00:35:53.110 --> 00:35:55.570
So I like to say, well, a
startup doesn't need a

00:35:55.570 --> 00:35:56.430
business model then.

00:35:56.430 --> 00:35:59.380
A startup needs a
startup model.

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:00.650
And these are the
five components

00:36:00.650 --> 00:36:02.530
of the startup model.

00:36:02.530 --> 00:36:07.080
We've got a set of assumptions
now from aware to passionate.

00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:10.700
And now we can go and try to
validate these and iterate on

00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:13.650
them until we discover
each step.

00:36:13.650 --> 00:36:17.950
When you're actually doing it
in practice, you start with

00:36:17.950 --> 00:36:21.460
hopeful, satisfied,
and passionate.

00:36:21.460 --> 00:36:25.550
So you may go out and get
tranches of users and test

00:36:25.550 --> 00:36:30.330
your marketing as you get
tranches of users in order to

00:36:30.330 --> 00:36:32.380
validate that you're actually
building something that

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:36.790
somebody wants, something
somebody needs or desires.

00:36:36.790 --> 00:36:40.140
But you're not optimizing your
conversion, or your funnel, or

00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:44.950
your acquisition until after
you've nailed passion.

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:46.470
So marketing--

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:47.900
your funnel, your
acquisition--

00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:50.680
marketing is not about
creating buzz.

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.640
Marketing is amplifying
the buzz that

00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.890
your product creates.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.320
So people should already be
wanting to share your product.

00:37:00.320 --> 00:37:02.390
They should be putting new
people into the top of your

00:37:02.390 --> 00:37:04.790
funnel without spending
a dime on marketing.

00:37:04.790 --> 00:37:06.160
That's when you know
you're ready to

00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.540
start hitting the pedal.

00:37:10.390 --> 00:37:13.080
So what we're hypothesizing
here-- what's the minimum

00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.280
functionality that we need
to fulfill the promise?

00:37:16.280 --> 00:37:20.390
So what is the promise you're
making to a customer segment,

00:37:20.390 --> 00:37:24.170
fulfilling that minimally,
iterating on it until you have

00:37:24.170 --> 00:37:26.530
what we consider a level of
satisfaction, which is a

00:37:26.530 --> 00:37:28.480
hypothesis that you make.

00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:33.740
A satisfied customer clicks on
features A, B, and C four

00:37:33.740 --> 00:37:34.770
times a week.

00:37:34.770 --> 00:37:37.930
That's a satisfied customer,
a hypothesis.

00:37:37.930 --> 00:37:40.080
Measure that.

00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:43.140
If you're not achieving it,
either you need to iterate on

00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.040
the product, look at a different
market segment, or

00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:48.840
change your hypothesis.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:51.630
You're iterating on that until
you nail the satisfaction.

00:37:51.630 --> 00:37:53.490
And then, what's the
difference between

00:37:53.490 --> 00:37:55.610
satisfaction and passion?

00:37:55.610 --> 00:37:56.860
So this is the money question.

00:37:59.830 --> 00:38:03.082
And what's interesting is that
it can be outside the product.

00:38:03.082 --> 00:38:06.040
Yep, you might be able to nail
the user experience--

00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:08.670
the user experience is so
awesome that people are

00:38:08.670 --> 00:38:09.840
passionate--

00:38:09.840 --> 00:38:11.650
but it could be something
that's outside of it.

00:38:11.650 --> 00:38:16.170
It could be, as Patrick
mentioned, that you've

00:38:16.170 --> 00:38:18.660
innovated inside of the
marketing that creates

00:38:18.660 --> 00:38:20.560
people's passion.

00:38:20.560 --> 00:38:23.830
So HubSpot is a great example.

00:38:23.830 --> 00:38:26.660
The people that share their
content the most are not

00:38:26.660 --> 00:38:28.700
paying customers.

00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.510
Their marketing itself
creates value.

00:38:32.510 --> 00:38:35.760
And so they have this huge
constituency of people that

00:38:35.760 --> 00:38:39.780
love HubSpot, even though they
can't afford the product.

00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:42.450
Yet they're using the free
tools, they're sharing the

00:38:42.450 --> 00:38:46.340
blogs, they're sharing the
e-books, and expanding the

00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.640
market reach out to people that
actually can afford it.

00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:52.090
Big brands are doing
this, right?

00:38:52.090 --> 00:38:57.100
So brands that go green, or
brands that change their

00:38:57.100 --> 00:39:01.250
packaging to make their
packaging more accessible, or

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:06.160
donating money to charities,
these are all ways that big

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.890
brands are trying to pull you in
to become passionate about

00:39:10.890 --> 00:39:12.990
their particular brand.

00:39:12.990 --> 00:39:15.030
Other ways it's separate.

00:39:15.030 --> 00:39:19.370
I have this little survey
project that I'm doing.

00:39:19.370 --> 00:39:23.990
And my customers are probably
only passionate about my

00:39:23.990 --> 00:39:26.195
product when their business
succeeds.

00:39:26.195 --> 00:39:30.060
Yet I can only help them so much
with my product, right?

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:32.700
They have to be a good
business person, too.

00:39:32.700 --> 00:39:35.780
So what might I do to
induce passion?

00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:37.260
Well, I might try to teach
them to become

00:39:37.260 --> 00:39:38.350
better business people.

00:39:38.350 --> 00:39:40.530
HubSpot actually does
this as well.

00:39:40.530 --> 00:39:42.790
So if I can get them to grow
their business, then they'll

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:46.030
equate their success
with my product.

00:39:46.030 --> 00:39:48.270
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: So in our
workshops, one of the examples

00:39:48.270 --> 00:39:51.590
we like to use is--

00:39:51.590 --> 00:39:53.530
I don't have it in my pocket
right now-- the American

00:39:53.530 --> 00:39:55.030
Express Platinum Card
I actually have.

00:39:55.030 --> 00:39:57.220
And I swear to god we're not
sponsored by American Express,

00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:59.080
even though we should be.

00:39:59.080 --> 00:39:59.900
BRANT COOPER: Here you go.

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:00.800
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Oh, that's
the card right there.

00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:03.740
So that card right there,
functionally, it's a credit

00:40:03.740 --> 00:40:05.390
card like any other, right?

00:40:05.390 --> 00:40:09.850
You swipe at the store, I get
the item, and then later on, I

00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:12.040
pay my bill like it's
a credit card.

00:40:12.040 --> 00:40:14.380
There are tens of thousands,
hundreds of thousands of

00:40:14.380 --> 00:40:15.933
credit cards probably available
in the United

00:40:15.933 --> 00:40:16.740
States, right?

00:40:16.740 --> 00:40:19.710
Yet I love that card.

00:40:19.710 --> 00:40:20.470
Why do I love that card?

00:40:20.470 --> 00:40:22.400
Why do I use that card
exclusively when I travel?

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:28.170
The reason why is, they've
induced passion in me, because

00:40:28.170 --> 00:40:30.210
it goes far beyond the
functionality of the product.

00:40:30.210 --> 00:40:31.980
And this is something we talk
about in the book is, what am

00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:33.700
I really hiring that
product to do?

00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.850
What am I really hiring that
credit card to do?

00:40:36.850 --> 00:40:44.950
I'm actually hiring it to solve
my vanity and security.

00:40:44.950 --> 00:40:46.770
Because the reason I use that
credit card is it gets me into

00:40:46.770 --> 00:40:48.830
airport lounges for free.

00:40:48.830 --> 00:40:49.895
It makes me feel awesome.

00:40:49.895 --> 00:40:51.055
That's what it does.

00:40:51.055 --> 00:40:54.680
That credit card makes
me feel amazing.

00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:56.240
It sounds sort of
goofy, right?

00:40:56.240 --> 00:40:59.660
But that's exactly how you
get passionate users.

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:03.930
Functionally, it's a credit
card just like any other

00:41:03.930 --> 00:41:04.585
credit card.

00:41:04.585 --> 00:41:05.940
I'm going to belabor
this point.

00:41:05.940 --> 00:41:09.300
But it makes you feel awesome,
so I can go to almost any

00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:09.880
airport lounge.

00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:12.240
And Brant and I do a lot of
traveling and speaking and

00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.230
consulting.

00:41:13.230 --> 00:41:15.305
And guess who gets to go,
walk in, flash his

00:41:15.305 --> 00:41:16.215
card, and sit down?

00:41:16.215 --> 00:41:17.750
It makes me feel awesome.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:19.270
So what am I hiring
that product for?

00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:20.950
I'm hiring it because apparently
I'm vain and

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:25.400
insecure and I need a--

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:25.670
BRANT COOPER: Affirmation.

00:41:25.670 --> 00:41:26.360
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Affirmation,
thank you.

00:41:26.360 --> 00:41:27.870
I need affirmation of my--

00:41:30.450 --> 00:41:31.630
BRANT COOPER: And how did you
learn about this card?

00:41:31.630 --> 00:41:32.800
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: So how
did I learn about it?

00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.010
Actually, you told me.

00:41:33.010 --> 00:41:35.865
BRANT COOPER: Right, so I must
be vain and insecure as well.

00:41:35.865 --> 00:41:37.470
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Exactly.

00:41:37.470 --> 00:41:41.160
The point is, this passion
stuff, it always goes much

00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:42.590
deeper than pure
functionality.

00:41:42.590 --> 00:41:44.380
Often, we talk to very
passionate founders.

00:41:44.380 --> 00:41:47.650
And they're like, I built this
great product, does X, Y, Z.

00:41:47.650 --> 00:41:49.290
And they're sort of stuck
at satisfied.

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.930
Oh, yeah, it does it.

00:41:50.930 --> 00:41:52.630
So it's sort of like the
sandwich I had yesterday.

00:41:52.630 --> 00:41:55.950
I had a sandwich, fine sandwich,
satisfied my hunger.

00:41:55.950 --> 00:41:58.020
I got up and went
back to work.

00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.710
Did I tell anyone about how
great the sandwich was?

00:41:59.710 --> 00:42:02.800
No, it didn't meet this
really deep--

00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:04.840
BRANT COOPER: You know, the
other great example I like to

00:42:04.840 --> 00:42:08.660
differentiate is when we
went to Vancouver.

00:42:08.660 --> 00:42:13.010
We're going and buying breakfast
before our talk.

00:42:13.010 --> 00:42:16.280
And I chose the most
expensive thing.

00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.210
It's just a little hole in
the wall breakfast place.

00:42:18.210 --> 00:42:19.720
I chose the most expensive--

00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.310
eggs, bacon, all this.

00:42:22.310 --> 00:42:24.460
And it came with a small coffee,
which I thought was

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:25.860
really pretty odd.

00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:27.430
And I'm all like, yeah,
can you just make

00:42:27.430 --> 00:42:28.590
that a large coffee?

00:42:28.590 --> 00:42:31.050
They were like, no.

00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:32.010
I'm like, what?

00:42:32.010 --> 00:42:33.310
Just make it a large coffee.

00:42:33.310 --> 00:42:35.340
Oh, well we can substitute
this.

00:42:35.340 --> 00:42:38.100
It'll cost you an extra $1.95
and blah, blah, blah.

00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.310
And I'm all like, wow.

00:42:40.310 --> 00:42:42.710
So I did it, bought
it, sat down.

00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:44.690
It was OK.

00:42:44.690 --> 00:42:47.215
And Patrick and I were
talking about this.

00:42:47.215 --> 00:42:50.400
This is maybe the downside
of doing what we do.

00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.430
We look at everything
through this lens.

00:42:52.430 --> 00:42:57.010
But anyway, Patrick then told a
story of the evening before.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:58.400
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Yeah,
so we were at this

00:42:58.400 --> 00:42:59.670
conference in Vancouver.

00:42:59.670 --> 00:43:02.100
I'd actually gone to this
restaurant across the way.

00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.495
I sat down by myself.

00:43:03.495 --> 00:43:07.670
I was waiting for Brant to
arrive, or my wife to arrive.

00:43:07.670 --> 00:43:09.650
Had dinner, ordered some
food, and then

00:43:09.650 --> 00:43:11.490
I felt like a lemonade.

00:43:11.490 --> 00:43:13.200
I'm like, hey, I don't see
lemonade on the menu.

00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:13.980
Can I have a lemonade?

00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.010
The waiter was like, we don't
have it on the menu, but I'll

00:43:16.010 --> 00:43:18.750
make one just for you, right?

00:43:18.750 --> 00:43:20.140
Guess who felt awesome?

00:43:20.140 --> 00:43:22.570
This guy right here.

00:43:22.570 --> 00:43:24.700
Guess who told everyone
about that restaurant?

00:43:24.700 --> 00:43:26.280
By the way, it's called
Cardero's.

00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:28.430
It's right on the pier
near Vancouver,

00:43:28.430 --> 00:43:29.065
right near the Westin.

00:43:29.065 --> 00:43:30.340
BRANT COOPER: And The breakfast
place that you

00:43:30.340 --> 00:43:31.490
should avoid is right
across the street.

00:43:31.490 --> 00:43:32.860
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: But so the
interesting thing actually--

00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:33.920
real quick, let me go next.

00:43:33.920 --> 00:43:35.980
But this stuff we're talking
about with the passion stuff,

00:43:35.980 --> 00:43:37.920
I actually think some of the
best entrepreneurs in the

00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.260
world, they think about
this stuff.

00:43:39.260 --> 00:43:41.740
And they go way deeper than
functionality, right?

00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.420
So the other day I was driving
home from Santa Barbara.

00:43:44.420 --> 00:43:48.710
We were on the PCH in Malibu,
and we were stuck in traffic.

00:43:48.710 --> 00:43:50.810
And we were right next to Nobu,
which is a very high-end

00:43:50.810 --> 00:43:53.130
sushi chain, if you guys
are familiar with it.

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.180
And I was looking at Nobu.

00:43:54.180 --> 00:43:55.660
I'm trying to figure
out, what are they

00:43:55.660 --> 00:43:57.140
really selling, right?

00:43:57.140 --> 00:44:00.560
I mean, superficially, they're
selling sushi, really good

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.805
sushi, theoretically.

00:44:01.805 --> 00:44:02.640
But what are they
really selling?

00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:04.500
And then I noticed, there's
two Ferraris.

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.780
And then, two guys who looked
like they owned the Ferraris

00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:06.960
were sitting there talking.

00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.250
I'm like, oh, I get it.

00:44:08.250 --> 00:44:11.320
What they're really selling is,
if you're a high net worth

00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.300
individual, here's where you
meet other high net worth

00:44:13.300 --> 00:44:15.210
individuals, right?

00:44:15.210 --> 00:44:17.130
That's what probably makes--
not only is it sushi grade,

00:44:17.130 --> 00:44:19.260
but you see a birds
of a feather flock

00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:20.290
together sort of thing.

00:44:20.290 --> 00:44:21.600
BRANT COOPER: Did you
go eat there?

00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:23.075
PATRICK VLASKOVITS:
No, I did not.

00:44:23.075 --> 00:44:25.730
But the point is, this
passionate--

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.160
I like to think of myself
as a decent marketer.

00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.060
And if you can imbue this,
figure out this passionate

00:44:31.060 --> 00:44:33.780
part of the startup model, I
think you get really powerful

00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.800
dividends on that.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:40.160
Something most people I
think don't quite get.

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.770
BRANT COOPER: So we like to
look at this lean startup

00:44:41.770 --> 00:44:44.020
stuff through the lenses
of understanding

00:44:44.020 --> 00:44:45.640
your customer deeply--

00:44:45.640 --> 00:44:48.520
how you interact with them,
how you run purpose built

00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:52.310
experiments to test the
viability of your ideas, and

00:44:52.310 --> 00:44:54.290
of course, measuring
the right data.

00:44:54.290 --> 00:44:57.490
I'm guessing Google does
data pretty well.

00:44:57.490 --> 00:44:59.700
So one of our most favorite
examples is AppFog.

00:44:59.700 --> 00:45:02.840
Has anybody heard of AppFog?

00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:07.020
So they're up in Portland.

00:45:07.020 --> 00:45:12.620
So Lucas Carlson, the CEO, the
founder, is kind of a classic

00:45:12.620 --> 00:45:15.670
hacker type, hangs out
on Hacker News.

00:45:15.670 --> 00:45:18.000
He's always got several
projects going.

00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:21.880
Never hit his home run though,
and he really wanted to.

00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.420
He didn't want to just
be this hacker guy.

00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:28.110
He actually wanted to build
a scalable business.

00:45:28.110 --> 00:45:32.630
And he's a PHP programmer.

00:45:32.630 --> 00:45:35.800
And a bunch of people were
chatting on Hacker News about

00:45:35.800 --> 00:45:37.610
the need for these cloud
services, sort of

00:45:37.610 --> 00:45:40.130
the Heroku for PHP.

00:45:40.130 --> 00:45:44.390
Cloud services already existed
for Ruby, another development

00:45:44.390 --> 00:45:47.470
language, and that was Heroku.

00:45:47.470 --> 00:45:49.310
So people were talking on Hacker
News about the need for

00:45:49.310 --> 00:45:52.340
these sorts of services
for PHP.

00:45:52.340 --> 00:45:55.190
And Lucas says, OK, I'm
going to do it.

00:45:55.190 --> 00:45:56.840
So it's late Friday night.

00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.720
He's getting ready to start
coding like he always does,

00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:01.445
just going to dive in.

00:46:01.445 --> 00:46:02.400
It was kind of late.

00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.270
His wife says, come to bed.

00:46:04.270 --> 00:46:06.491
Work on that tomorrow.

00:46:06.491 --> 00:46:07.980
And Lucas goes, all right.

00:46:07.980 --> 00:46:13.390
So he puts up a classic Tim
Ferris-esque landing page, a

00:46:13.390 --> 00:46:15.070
one page website.

00:46:15.070 --> 00:46:16.610
Puts his messaging
positioning--

00:46:16.610 --> 00:46:18.610
hey, you want to join
my beta program?

00:46:18.610 --> 00:46:21.010
Click here.

00:46:21.010 --> 00:46:24.652
Posts that on Hacker News
and goes to bed.

00:46:24.652 --> 00:46:27.270
He wakes up the next day--

00:46:27.270 --> 00:46:29.545
800 people signed up.

00:46:29.545 --> 00:46:34.240
He's all like, wow, I got
something here maybe.

00:46:34.240 --> 00:46:37.720
But I just promised these people
to enter a beta program

00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.930
that doesn't exist.

00:46:39.930 --> 00:46:42.370
So he starts coding, coding,
coding, coding.

00:46:42.370 --> 00:46:44.380
A week goes by--

00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:45.070
coding, coding.

00:46:45.070 --> 00:46:48.840
Two weeks go by, a month goes
by, and he's all like, if I

00:46:48.840 --> 00:46:53.400
continue down this path building
this rock-solid cloud

00:46:53.400 --> 00:46:57.490
services platform, it's going
to take six months, a year.

00:46:57.490 --> 00:46:59.940
By this time, he's got 4,000
people signed up

00:46:59.940 --> 00:47:01.770
for his beta program--

00:47:01.770 --> 00:47:04.670
4,000.

00:47:04.670 --> 00:47:06.930
So if it takes me a year,
what's going to happen?

00:47:06.930 --> 00:47:08.290
I'm going to lose all
of these people.

00:47:10.840 --> 00:47:14.990
So he decides to run what we
call a high hurdle experiment.

00:47:14.990 --> 00:47:17.290
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: So this
was actually sort

00:47:17.290 --> 00:47:19.560
of a stroke of genius.

00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:22.130
He knew he couldn't support
all 4,000 people.

00:47:22.130 --> 00:47:23.840
The product certainly
wasn't ready for it.

00:47:23.840 --> 00:47:25.680
He didn't have time for it.

00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:28.090
So what he needed to do is
actually surface who his early

00:47:28.090 --> 00:47:30.320
adopters were, right?

00:47:30.320 --> 00:47:32.260
And so typically what happens
in this case-- most startups

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.390
just open the gate and say,
we're open for business.

00:47:35.390 --> 00:47:37.630
Come on in.

00:47:37.630 --> 00:47:42.210
The stroke of genius was that
Lucas actually made them

00:47:42.210 --> 00:47:43.990
surface themselves
by showing pay.

00:47:43.990 --> 00:47:46.610
They actually had to trade
in some sort of currency.

00:47:46.610 --> 00:47:47.610
And it wasn't money.

00:47:47.610 --> 00:47:48.800
It was actually time.

00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:53.440
So he developed a survey, an
open-ended, multi-question

00:47:53.440 --> 00:47:57.267
survey with open text fields,
minimum 1,000 words, et

00:47:57.267 --> 00:47:58.560
cetera, et cetera.

00:47:58.560 --> 00:48:00.710
What's the meaning of life,
what's your favorite color?

00:48:00.710 --> 00:48:03.470
Super open-ended stuff
that took you 45

00:48:03.470 --> 00:48:06.320
minutes to get through.

00:48:06.320 --> 00:48:08.645
So this wasn't a typical online
marketing thing where

00:48:08.645 --> 00:48:10.770
it's like three questions, don't
ask them for their email

00:48:10.770 --> 00:48:13.430
address, radio buttons and just
hit Submit, just where

00:48:13.430 --> 00:48:17.320
you get high conversion rates,
but not very much fidelity or

00:48:17.320 --> 00:48:19.210
detail on the data.

00:48:19.210 --> 00:48:22.176
This is, if you want
access to AppFog--

00:48:22.176 --> 00:48:23.140
BRANT COOPER: Jump through
this hoop.

00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:24.570
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: --jump
through these hoops and these

00:48:24.570 --> 00:48:25.940
four more hoops, right?

00:48:25.940 --> 00:48:29.380
Because he wanted to whittle
down this group of 4,000 to a

00:48:29.380 --> 00:48:32.650
few dozen, right?

00:48:32.650 --> 00:48:37.460
What happened, cutting a long
story short, 50% of the people

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.230
converted on that survey,
to 2,000 people.

00:48:41.230 --> 00:48:43.770
He actually then read
all 2,000 responses.

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:46.880
He also did some--

00:48:46.880 --> 00:48:47.560
BRANT COOPER: Data mining.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.730
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: --data
mining as well.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:50.630
Turned out, the three things
that he thought were most

00:48:50.630 --> 00:48:52.040
important were not.

00:48:52.040 --> 00:48:54.840
Long story short, he's seeing
exponential black swan-like

00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:55.350
type growth.

00:48:55.350 --> 00:48:57.320
He's doing really great, ended
up raising something like $10

00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:59.840
million last year.

00:48:59.840 --> 00:49:01.760
They're growing steadily.

00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:04.030
The point is really, though,
what he needed to do right--

00:49:04.030 --> 00:49:05.465
he did a lot of things right--
but he surfaced.

00:49:05.465 --> 00:49:09.820
He actually made these early
adopters pay for

00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.640
the product, right?

00:49:10.640 --> 00:49:13.130
So people who aren't going to
pay with their time aren't

00:49:13.130 --> 00:49:16.440
probably going to be good
early adopters for this.

00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:17.960
BRANT COOPER: So I love also
that he did market

00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.300
segmentation really there.

00:49:19.300 --> 00:49:21.900
The fact is, he knew where
his market hung out.

00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.410
He was one of them, but he
didn't just listen to himself.

00:49:24.410 --> 00:49:26.650
He went out, and there was all
these people on Hacker News.

00:49:26.650 --> 00:49:30.080
So that was actually
good marketing.

00:49:30.080 --> 00:49:32.390
He didn't necessarily just
believe-- a lot of startups,

00:49:32.390 --> 00:49:34.635
oh, I got thousands of email
addresses, and they go, oh

00:49:34.635 --> 00:49:36.100
yeah, I'm good to go.

00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:38.410
A bunch of people gave me
their email address.

00:49:38.410 --> 00:49:39.540
But he didn't believe that.

00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:42.010
He doubled down and really made
these people prove that

00:49:42.010 --> 00:49:44.240
they actually wanted
his product.

00:49:44.240 --> 00:49:45.970
And then what he built
was a classic

00:49:45.970 --> 00:49:46.955
minimum viable product.

00:49:46.955 --> 00:49:49.260
He actually, instead of building
the rock solid

00:49:49.260 --> 00:49:53.470
platform based on the data
that he gathered--

00:49:53.470 --> 00:49:55.200
just three or four features.

00:49:55.200 --> 00:49:57.860
Imagine three or four features
on the user interface.

00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:00.810
What is the minimum I need to do
to fulfill the promise I've

00:50:00.810 --> 00:50:03.270
made to these people?

00:50:03.270 --> 00:50:05.310
Put that on the user interface,
and then just build

00:50:05.310 --> 00:50:08.880
the back end for those three or
four features, and launch.

00:50:08.880 --> 00:50:12.500
It's funny, I was telling this
story at my coffee meet up

00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:13.330
down in San Diego.

00:50:13.330 --> 00:50:15.100
And three or four of the people
in the coffee meet up

00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:16.000
went, oh, I remember that.

00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:17.270
I was on that.

00:50:17.270 --> 00:50:19.410
God, that product sucked.

00:50:19.410 --> 00:50:21.580
And it was like, yeah,
but did you use it?

00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:24.060
Oh yeah, it was the only
thing available, right?

00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:27.190
So it gave him the platform, it
gave him the start of where

00:50:27.190 --> 00:50:29.240
to iterate on.

00:50:29.240 --> 00:50:31.670
What was his launching point?

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:34.340
What is this minimum
viable product?

00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:35.900
And that's what he
built a whole

00:50:35.900 --> 00:50:36.860
scalable company around--

00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:39.770
a fascinating story.

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:41.360
Good, well that's what
we got for you.

00:50:41.360 --> 00:50:45.599
So we'd love to hear more about

00:50:45.599 --> 00:50:46.976
what's going on at Google.

00:50:50.650 --> 00:50:53.920
BRANT COOPER: So anybody have
some good stories here, or

00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:58.190
issues that Google's facing,
or what you guys do well?

00:50:58.190 --> 00:51:00.060
Yeah.

00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:01.060
AUDIENCE: Question--

00:51:01.060 --> 00:51:05.483
how do you guys really think
about [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:05.483 --> 00:51:09.740
setting up tests around--

00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:11.370
BRANT COOPER: Like for
internal processes?

00:51:11.370 --> 00:51:16.150
AUDIENCE: Internal processes
or teams, and just--

00:51:16.150 --> 00:51:17.760
BRANT COOPER: Yeah, well it's
an interesting question.

00:51:17.760 --> 00:51:22.880
Yeah, well I think that you're
almost talking what I'm

00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.680
calling the stage two.

00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.290
If they graduate from stage two
and a particular product

00:51:27.290 --> 00:51:30.490
has proved its business model,
instead of turning that over

00:51:30.490 --> 00:51:34.090
to a core business, you just let
it continue to function.

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:38.240
Let it grow organically into
a core business of its own.

00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.790
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: I think what
you're saying is, I think

00:51:39.790 --> 00:51:41.710
that the way that problem gets
solved in the startup world--

00:51:41.710 --> 00:51:43.250
I don't know about the
large org world--

00:51:43.250 --> 00:51:45.340
you have cross-functional teams
that sort of naturally

00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.590
mutate to the right response
to the market.

00:51:48.590 --> 00:51:50.260
Does that make sense?

00:51:50.260 --> 00:51:51.790
And actually, we talk about
cross-functional teams.

00:51:51.790 --> 00:51:54.810
I think with the way that
product management and product

00:51:54.810 --> 00:51:56.390
development is changing,
because of this sort of

00:51:56.390 --> 00:52:00.000
hyper-connected software economy
we're living in, I

00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:02.370
think you're going to see what
you're talking about.

00:52:02.370 --> 00:52:04.780
Instead of these functional
lines of business-- like,

00:52:04.780 --> 00:52:06.230
marketing, hand it over
to sales, and

00:52:06.230 --> 00:52:07.670
you have these siloed--

00:52:07.670 --> 00:52:10.990
I think you're going to see, in
some cases, more of these

00:52:10.990 --> 00:52:14.170
cross-functional teams that
basically mutate to the proper

00:52:14.170 --> 00:52:14.770
market response.

00:52:14.770 --> 00:52:17.150
Does that make sense?

00:52:17.150 --> 00:52:17.390
No.

00:52:17.390 --> 00:52:18.280
AUDIENCE: Kind of--

00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:20.637
I mean, you're always going
to have front-line sales

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.593
[INAUDIBLE], right?

00:52:22.593 --> 00:52:25.820
A large company like this will
always have [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:25.820 --> 00:52:27.104
most of our money.

00:52:27.104 --> 00:52:30.270
You're always going to have--

00:52:30.270 --> 00:52:31.780
BRANT COOPER: Doing a completely
different selling

00:52:31.780 --> 00:52:34.777
model versus what the core
business is doing.

00:52:34.777 --> 00:52:36.660
AUDIENCE: Exactly.

00:52:36.660 --> 00:52:38.740
BRANT COOPER: Yeah, I don't
think I actually can come up

00:52:38.740 --> 00:52:39.140
with examples.

00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:40.390
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:52:42.253 --> 00:52:45.211
one guy who's like a quarterback
[INAUDIBLE]

00:52:45.211 --> 00:52:49.160
product specialist
[INAUDIBLE].

00:52:49.160 --> 00:52:52.490
BRANT COOPER: I've seen it
around market segments.

00:52:52.490 --> 00:52:57.120
Intuit's acquisition of Mint was
really going way outside

00:52:57.120 --> 00:53:00.080
of their comfort zone, because
they had no ability to market

00:53:00.080 --> 00:53:02.930
and attract that particular
constituency.

00:53:02.930 --> 00:53:07.150
But also, they did already
have online sales.

00:53:07.150 --> 00:53:08.250
So it's not like
they completely

00:53:08.250 --> 00:53:09.510
changed their sales model.

00:53:12.420 --> 00:53:14.160
So yeah, I'm not sure.

00:53:14.160 --> 00:53:21.180
I think that there's a natural
growth where organizations

00:53:21.180 --> 00:53:22.310
start online.

00:53:22.310 --> 00:53:26.020
And then they evolved to field
sales, or vice versa, so that

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:28.160
they're covering different
channels.

00:53:28.160 --> 00:53:30.370
But I think it's driven by
market segments more than it

00:53:30.370 --> 00:53:35.380
is by concentrating on specific
selling models.

00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.841
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:53:36.841 --> 00:53:39.010
BRANT COOPER: Right, so your
market segment is actually--

00:53:39.010 --> 00:53:40.870
this is one of our problems,
actually, with some of the

00:53:40.870 --> 00:53:43.540
business model canvas stuff is
that it presumes that you're

00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:48.320
making decisions about your
market segmentation and your

00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.760
sales channels and your
marketing and your partners

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.480
sort of independently.

00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:54.550
And actually, your market
segment drives all of that

00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:55.610
stuff, right?

00:53:55.610 --> 00:53:58.240
So if you choose a particular
market segment, they expect to

00:53:58.240 --> 00:53:59.535
buy in a particular way.

00:53:59.535 --> 00:54:03.400
And so if you chose field
sales and you're doing a

00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:05.520
segment that expects online
sales, then you've got a

00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.960
fundamental mismatch.

00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:09.394
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: The esoteric
analog idea I like to

00:54:09.394 --> 00:54:11.650
use is, you're playing
a game of

00:54:11.650 --> 00:54:13.290
simultaneous equations, right?

00:54:13.290 --> 00:54:17.120
Your market segment channels
your product, right?

00:54:17.120 --> 00:54:19.510
Those are all independent
variables that you actually

00:54:19.510 --> 00:54:22.340
have to solve for at the same
time, simultaneously.

00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:24.830
And if you do that
right, you have a

00:54:24.830 --> 00:54:26.260
scalable business, right?

00:54:26.260 --> 00:54:29.030
And if you double down-- let's
say you hold one constant,

00:54:29.030 --> 00:54:33.530
then you have to make sure
the others fit, right?

00:54:33.530 --> 00:54:36.170
And so what you're saying is,
you should let the sales

00:54:36.170 --> 00:54:37.515
channel flip.

00:54:37.515 --> 00:54:39.540
You should be able to flip
that variable and let the

00:54:39.540 --> 00:54:41.510
others solve for that, right?

00:54:41.510 --> 00:54:43.350
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:54:43.350 --> 00:54:45.205
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: How to
change the sales model?

00:54:45.205 --> 00:54:46.780
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:48.310
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: You know,
some of the most interesting

00:54:48.310 --> 00:54:52.160
people that do some of this
stuff are the mercenary

00:54:52.160 --> 00:54:56.100
affiliate marketers and direct
marketer staff, the guys that

00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:58.470
actually buy a lot of--

00:54:58.470 --> 00:55:00.080
they have big PPC spends.

00:55:00.080 --> 00:55:01.690
Those guys are pretty aggressive
in experimentation.

00:55:01.690 --> 00:55:03.350
They almost don't care what
they sell as long

00:55:03.350 --> 00:55:05.250
as they make money.

00:55:05.250 --> 00:55:07.080
I have friends in that space.

00:55:07.080 --> 00:55:12.740
And they often are very open to
experimenting in terms of

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:14.800
sales models, often because
their concern is their sale

00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.085
spend, right?

00:55:16.085 --> 00:55:17.890
That's sort of the driving
concern for those people.

00:55:17.890 --> 00:55:19.520
But I've seen those people
do sort of small-scale

00:55:19.520 --> 00:55:21.000
experiments.

00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.090
Those are generally not
very large businesses.

00:55:24.090 --> 00:55:25.730
BRANT COOPER: I think most of
the examples I can think of

00:55:25.730 --> 00:55:27.890
off the top of my head come
from acquisition.

00:55:27.890 --> 00:55:30.470
And so they're acquiring
somebody that has a different

00:55:30.470 --> 00:55:31.420
sales model.

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:35.700
And the question then becomes,
do they try to suck it in, or

00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:40.420
do they let it go, let it
continue to just be what made

00:55:40.420 --> 00:55:43.220
that company successful and why
they wanted to acquire it?

00:55:43.220 --> 00:55:46.060
But I can't think of, off the
top of my head, a large

00:55:46.060 --> 00:55:49.130
organization that's running
experiments around changing a

00:55:49.130 --> 00:55:51.050
sales model.

00:55:51.050 --> 00:55:52.440
But I don't see why--

00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.700
I think part of the lean startup
stuff gets stuck

00:55:56.700 --> 00:55:59.950
inside of engineering
departments.

00:55:59.950 --> 00:56:04.340
And there's just really no
reason why it can't be started

00:56:04.340 --> 00:56:07.150
over in marketing
or sales or PM.

00:56:07.150 --> 00:56:11.170
I think it's really the concept
of allowing people to

00:56:11.170 --> 00:56:14.200
take a percentage of their time
and do whatever they want

00:56:14.200 --> 00:56:16.970
should be across the board,
all functions.

00:56:16.970 --> 00:56:21.050
And then having individuals
like that--

00:56:21.050 --> 00:56:23.505
the ability to go out
and run their own

00:56:23.505 --> 00:56:25.740
experiments like that.

00:56:25.740 --> 00:56:30.310
Yeah, so it depends on
what the product is.

00:56:30.310 --> 00:56:31.790
So the stage one--

00:56:31.790 --> 00:56:33.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:35.710 --> 00:56:37.020
BRANT COOPER: Right, so it's
all based upon your

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:37.880
hypotheses.

00:56:37.880 --> 00:56:40.190
So everything you're doing
is just starting with a

00:56:40.190 --> 00:56:40.930
hypothesis.

00:56:40.930 --> 00:56:46.070
If I do X, customers will do
Y, or a Y percentage of

00:56:46.070 --> 00:56:49.120
customers will do Z.

00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:50.411
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: So if the
experiment fails, that you

00:56:50.411 --> 00:56:52.040
know why it failed, right?

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:54.315
If you don't know why it failed,
it's like, oh, that

00:56:54.315 --> 00:56:59.090
didn't work, you'd much prefer,
oh, that didn't work

00:56:59.090 --> 00:57:00.690
because it turns out
my customers

00:57:00.690 --> 00:57:02.100
don't like blue lollipops.

00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.335
It turns out they actually
hate them because it

00:57:03.335 --> 00:57:03.930
reminds them of--

00:57:03.930 --> 00:57:05.660
I don't know what, right?

00:57:05.660 --> 00:57:06.660
That's actually-- you've
learned something.

00:57:06.660 --> 00:57:09.190
And then, you can actually
build up this body of

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:10.530
knowledge and theoretically
pivot to

00:57:10.530 --> 00:57:11.950
something that works, right?

00:57:11.950 --> 00:57:14.030
But it's actually an interesting
question, because

00:57:14.030 --> 00:57:15.610
one of the large companies we
work with, they have these

00:57:15.610 --> 00:57:16.290
intrapreneurs--

00:57:16.290 --> 00:57:17.080
we've talked about that.

00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.560
You can actually go through a
cycle of learning tremendous

00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:24.620
amounts, and the actual
project fails.

00:57:24.620 --> 00:57:27.360
And right now, the structures
and processes are set up like,

00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:30.015
oh, your projects failed, ergo
you've not performed well.

00:57:30.015 --> 00:57:34.650
But they've actually created a
body of knowledge around this.

00:57:34.650 --> 00:57:37.210
And that actually has
created value.

00:57:37.210 --> 00:57:40.960
BRANT COOPER: That's really
where the true meaning of the

00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:44.330
word "pivot" comes from is, if
that thing fails, yet there's

00:57:44.330 --> 00:57:46.410
learning in there that actually
forms the basis of a

00:57:46.410 --> 00:57:47.580
new project.

00:57:47.580 --> 00:57:52.520
But again, if you're making a
promise to somebody, what's

00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:57.710
the minimum functionality that's
going to fulfill that

00:57:57.710 --> 00:58:00.440
promise becomes your minimum
viable product.

00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:02.860
Then you should be able to
create a hypothesis that says,

00:58:02.860 --> 00:58:04.970
this is what people are going
to do will indicate

00:58:04.970 --> 00:58:07.250
satisfaction.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:12.090
And so in the different various
startup stages, the

00:58:12.090 --> 00:58:16.500
validating learning that you're
using could be number

00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:17.970
of customers that
have indicated

00:58:17.970 --> 00:58:18.920
that they're passion.

00:58:18.920 --> 00:58:23.120
I'm seeing a viral coefficient
of 0.7.

00:58:23.120 --> 00:58:27.780
I've got 1,000 customers
within this

00:58:27.780 --> 00:58:32.060
specific market segment.

00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:35.550
So it's measuring user passion,
and then it's

00:58:35.550 --> 00:58:38.910
measuring the number of users
based upon what you think you

00:58:38.910 --> 00:58:40.200
should be seeing.

00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.320
And then it starts getting into,
well, how much does it

00:58:42.320 --> 00:58:44.020
cost for me to acquire them?

00:58:44.020 --> 00:58:46.960
And what's the lifetime value?

00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:49.760
And can I shrink the sales
cycle that increases the

00:58:49.760 --> 00:58:54.110
velocity of customer passion?

00:58:54.110 --> 00:58:57.390
And so these are the things
that you want to--

00:58:57.390 --> 00:59:00.040
and this stuff only really works
when you have buy-in

00:59:00.040 --> 00:59:00.610
from the top.

00:59:00.610 --> 00:59:03.200
Because there are all of these
metrics that you have to prove

00:59:03.200 --> 00:59:05.050
before profitability.

00:59:05.050 --> 00:59:08.910
But the moment you measure
profitability first, then

00:59:08.910 --> 00:59:10.500
that's almost a guarantee
of failure.

00:59:10.500 --> 00:59:17.210
Because it's less popular than a
black swan that somebody can

00:59:17.210 --> 00:59:20.500
stumble across some new
disruptive that starts

00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:21.930
producing money quickly.

00:59:21.930 --> 00:59:26.590
So does that answer at all what
you're trying to get at?

00:59:26.590 --> 00:59:28.240
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: It's always
contextual, right?

00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:34.360
So let's say I had a community
site with user-generated

00:59:34.360 --> 00:59:36.510
content, right?

00:59:36.510 --> 00:59:38.790
An appropriate metric might be
time spent on site, or balance

00:59:38.790 --> 00:59:41.270
rate, or what have you.

00:59:41.270 --> 00:59:45.970
Because I could say, hey Brant,
looks like I had 10,000

00:59:45.970 --> 00:59:48.750
visitors, and on average they
spent 25 minutes per day.

00:59:48.750 --> 00:59:49.690
I know that's pretty good.

00:59:49.690 --> 00:59:50.290
Something's happening.

00:59:50.290 --> 00:59:52.060
I haven't made any money
on these guys yet.

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.590
But the fact anyone is spending
25 minutes on my

00:59:54.590 --> 00:59:57.350
site, that's actually
nontrivial.

00:59:57.350 --> 01:00:00.795
Let's dig in further, right?

01:00:00.795 --> 01:00:01.725
BRANT COOPER: Yep.

01:00:01.725 --> 01:00:04.050
AUDIENCE: Hi Patrick, Brant,
thanks for being here.

01:00:04.050 --> 01:00:05.890
BRANT COOPER: You're welcome.

01:00:05.890 --> 01:00:09.500
AUDIENCE: So the question I have
is around selecting the

01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:10.458
market segment.

01:00:10.458 --> 01:00:14.325
So say I have an MVP, I did
whatever serving thing

01:00:14.325 --> 01:00:16.300
[INAUDIBLE].

01:00:16.300 --> 01:00:17.240
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: What's your

01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.570
objective in terms of that?

01:00:19.570 --> 01:00:23.230
AUDIENCE: So I can go deeper and
find more of those people.

01:00:23.230 --> 01:00:24.800
BRANT COOPER: So yeah, we didn't
really touch on market

01:00:24.800 --> 01:00:25.440
segments at all.

01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:28.570
But basically, the first thing
we usually talk about is that

01:00:28.570 --> 01:00:31.920
market segment's defined by
people that share the same

01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.890
problem or passion.

01:00:32.890 --> 01:00:34.260
So it's not demographics.

01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:37.180
It's not, I'm going after
a particular vertical or

01:00:37.180 --> 01:00:38.380
firmographics.

01:00:38.380 --> 01:00:41.090
People who share the same pain
or passion and speak the same

01:00:41.090 --> 01:00:43.920
language, which means that they
would refer to each other

01:00:43.920 --> 01:00:45.660
for solutions.

01:00:45.660 --> 01:00:47.600
So if you're going out there
and you're running these

01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:51.080
purposeful experiments to test
these different market

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:55.210
segments, then we talk about in
the book just a simple back

01:00:55.210 --> 01:00:57.870
of the napkin approach of
using a segment matrix.

01:00:57.870 --> 01:01:02.640
So you can list your different
market segments based on rows.

01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:04.850
And then, your columns are
different ways to evaluate

01:01:04.850 --> 01:01:09.820
those market segments-- could be
depth of pain, how easy are

01:01:09.820 --> 01:01:13.310
they to reach in terms of
marketing, do they have budget

01:01:13.310 --> 01:01:17.650
if that's necessary, how easy is
it to build an MVP for this

01:01:17.650 --> 01:01:22.170
particular market segment, or
even, what are your particular

01:01:22.170 --> 01:01:24.250
personal values or
corporate values?

01:01:24.250 --> 01:01:25.850
Here's a market segment that's
important to us.

01:01:25.850 --> 01:01:28.970
Here's one, eh, it's not
that important to us.

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:32.350
Rank them all high, medium, and
low inside of this matrix,

01:01:32.350 --> 01:01:38.040
go out and validate that your
estimations are about right.

01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:41.280
Usually one or two market
segments sort of rises to the

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.700
top as ones that, based on your
own evaluation, look like

01:01:45.700 --> 01:01:48.460
they would be the right market
segments to go after.

01:01:48.460 --> 01:01:51.790
Sometimes I counsel you might
do like a 70-20-10 approach.

01:01:51.790 --> 01:01:56.830
Put 70% of your resources into
the top segment, 20% into a

01:01:56.830 --> 01:02:00.020
second segment, let the
rest be opportunistic.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:02.820
Go out and try to validate
whether this is going to be a

01:02:02.820 --> 01:02:03.395
winning segment.

01:02:03.395 --> 01:02:05.440
And if not, you've got the
second one that's sort of

01:02:05.440 --> 01:02:07.770
already in motion.

01:02:07.770 --> 01:02:10.660
And you've got the 10%
opportunistic that you can

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.160
raise up to being the
second one again.

01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:13.706
So that might be one approach.

01:02:13.706 --> 01:02:14.780
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: In the book,
we talk about the jobs

01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:16.560
to be done model, which
is something--

01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:16.970
AUDIENCE: The what?

01:02:16.970 --> 01:02:20.930
PATRICK VLASKOVITS: Jobs to be
done model of segmentation.

01:02:20.930 --> 01:02:23.273
Clayton Christensen and his
colleagues developed that.

01:02:23.273 --> 01:02:26.140
And it's, what are you hiring
the product for?

01:02:26.140 --> 01:02:29.790
So the classic example is, as a
customer, if I buy a quarter

01:02:29.790 --> 01:02:32.486
inch drill bit, what am I
really buying, right?

01:02:32.486 --> 01:02:34.450
I'm buying a quarter
inch hole, right?

01:02:34.450 --> 01:02:36.330
And so you look at segmentation

01:02:36.330 --> 01:02:36.870
through that model.

01:02:36.870 --> 01:02:38.670
What's the problem that
you're solving?

01:02:38.670 --> 01:02:41.680
And that is actually
very insightful.

01:02:41.680 --> 01:02:43.954
We talk about that
in the book, too.

01:02:43.954 --> 01:02:44.910
Well, thank you.

01:02:44.910 --> 01:02:45.810
Thanks for having us.

01:02:45.810 --> 01:02:46.110
BRANT COOPER: Thank you.

01:02:46.110 --> 01:02:49.503
[APPLAUSE]
