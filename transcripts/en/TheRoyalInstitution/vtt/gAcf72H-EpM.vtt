00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.240
Now in looking at what
actually keeps airplanes up,

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:09.280
we can just look at
the shape of the wing,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.720
which is a cross-section
of an aircraft wing,

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:16.820
and think of the air passing
over the wing rather than

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:18.832
the wing passing
through the air.

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:20.040
The results will be the same.

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:21.748
And, in fact, in wind
tunnels, of course,

00:00:21.748 --> 00:00:24.390
the wing is held stationary,
the air is blown past it.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.620
So if you get that
picture to begin with,

00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:29.310
you'll see that the air
has to divide some of it

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.189
over the top and some
of it underneath.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:35.040
And the air that
goes through the top

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.680
produces certain
effects in combination

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.630
with the air that
goes underneath that

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.690
does, in fact, affect
the lift and produces

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:44.190
the upward force of the wing.

00:00:44.190 --> 00:00:46.650
Now to explain that we have
first a little experiment

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:49.610
that we will show you
called Venturi tube.

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:52.920
And if I come around
and turn the machine on,

00:00:53.160 --> 00:00:54.920
you can see what happens.

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:57.200
This is water flow not air.

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.500
But the arrangement and the
results will be similar.

00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:05.160
Now we have a tube here, which
is shaped in a particular way.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.790
It's not the same
section everywhere.

00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.390
There's a narrow
throat at that point.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:13.530
And there is a wide
section at the inlet

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:15.210
and a wide section at the outlet.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:17.640
In fact, the water is
now flowing through it.

00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:19.680
The valve, I think, is open.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:21.400
And you can see
from these tubes--

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:25.380
which are attached to holes
at the top of the main stream tube

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.680
that the pressure, in fact, is
different in different sections

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.790
of the tube.

00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.610
Where the tube is
narrow the water

00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:35.160
must be going faster
because the water is

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:36.930
virtually incompressible.

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:39.540
So here is fast flowing
water at the neck

00:01:39.540 --> 00:01:42.654
and slow flowing water at
the two ends of the tube.

00:01:42.654 --> 00:01:44.070
And the difference
in the pressure

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.350
is shown by the
level of liquids,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.900
which you can see in the tubes.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.100
Here, the pressure is low.

00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:52.160
It's not holding up much
liquid.

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:54.060
And here the pressure is higher.

00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:56.670
So we would conclude
from that the

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:00.150
faster that the liquid goes
then the less the pressure.

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:02.550
And in fact, it
is that basic idea

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:05.640
that keeps the airplane
up as we looked

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.200
at the wing a few minutes ago.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:10.590
The mathematical
form of the result

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.480
is shown on the
slide there, which

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:18.000
relates the velocity
of the flow, which

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.730
is u, to the pressure.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.590
In the relationship
of that kind,

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:24.330
it's called Bernoulli's law.

00:02:24.330 --> 00:02:27.080
And it says that if
the pressure goes up...

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:29.110
Let me say that again.

00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:31.830
If the velocity goes up, then
the pressure will go down

00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:33.120
and conversely.

00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:35.850
So where the water or
the air is flowing faster

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:37.470
that will be the lower pressure.

00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:41.910
And in fact, that effect
is what keeps the wing up.

00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:43.860
When the air divides
over the wing,

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.300
it has to travel rather
faster on the top section

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.637
than it does underneath.

00:02:47.637 --> 00:02:49.470
And the difference
between the two pressures

00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:51.530
provides the lift.
