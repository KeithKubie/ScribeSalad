00:00:03.439 --> 00:00:03.449
fun science fun science fun science is a
 

00:00:03.449 --> 00:00:05.360
fun science fun science fun science is a
science of fun yeah today I'd like to

00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:05.370
science of fun yeah today I'd like to
 

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:10.390
science of fun yeah today I'd like to
tell you some cool things about light ah

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:10.400
tell you some cool things about light ah
 

00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:12.530
tell you some cool things about light ah
now as I'm sure you're aware the speed

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
now as I'm sure you're aware the speed
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:16.220
now as I'm sure you're aware the speed
of light is 299,792,458 meters per

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
of light is 299,792,458 meters per
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.429
of light is 299,792,458 meters per
second which is pretty bloomin fast to

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:19.439
second which is pretty bloomin fast to
 

00:00:19.439 --> 00:00:20.810
second which is pretty bloomin fast to
give you an idea as to how fast that

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:20.820
give you an idea as to how fast that
 

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:22.070
give you an idea as to how fast that
actually is it would take a beam of

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:22.080
actually is it would take a beam of
 

00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:24.529
actually is it would take a beam of
light 1.25 five seconds to travel from

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:24.539
light 1.25 five seconds to travel from
 

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:26.300
light 1.25 five seconds to travel from
the earth to the moon the speed of sound

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:26.310
the earth to the moon the speed of sound
 

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:28.550
the earth to the moon the speed of sound
is only 340 meters per second which is

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:28.560
is only 340 meters per second which is
 

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.919
is only 340 meters per second which is
still pretty fast even though thanks to

00:00:30.919 --> 00:00:30.929
still pretty fast even though thanks to
 

00:00:30.929 --> 00:00:32.870
still pretty fast even though thanks to
science humans have managed to go faster

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:32.880
science humans have managed to go faster
 

00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:34.069
science humans have managed to go faster
than that but if you want to go faster

00:00:34.069 --> 00:00:34.079
than that but if you want to go faster
 

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.620
than that but if you want to go faster
than light then sorry you can't it's not

00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:36.630
than light then sorry you can't it's not
 

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.090
than light then sorry you can't it's not
possible it's theoretically possible

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
possible it's theoretically possible
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:39.680
possible it's theoretically possible
that we could one day travel very very

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:39.690
that we could one day travel very very
 

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:42.170
that we could one day travel very very
nearly almost as fast as light but to go

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
nearly almost as fast as light but to go
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:44.840
nearly almost as fast as light but to go
faster than that's no sorry now before I

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:44.850
faster than that's no sorry now before I
 

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:45.740
faster than that's no sorry now before I
can tell you about all of the really

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:45.750
can tell you about all of the really
 

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:47.029
can tell you about all of the really
cool stuff that comes with light in the

00:00:47.029 --> 00:00:47.039
cool stuff that comes with light in the
 

00:00:47.039 --> 00:00:48.049
cool stuff that comes with light in the
speed of light I have to tell you about

00:00:48.049 --> 00:00:48.059
speed of light I have to tell you about
 

00:00:48.059 --> 00:00:49.459
speed of light I have to tell you about
this other thing called the Doppler

00:00:49.459 --> 00:00:49.469
this other thing called the Doppler
 

00:00:49.469 --> 00:00:51.350
this other thing called the Doppler
effect which is still really interesting

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
effect which is still really interesting
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:52.610
effect which is still really interesting
so you know don't leave just yet the

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:52.620
so you know don't leave just yet the
 

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:53.840
so you know don't leave just yet the
Doppler effect is the change that you

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:53.850
Doppler effect is the change that you
 

00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:55.549
Doppler effect is the change that you
notice in the frequency of a wave when

00:00:55.549 --> 00:00:55.559
notice in the frequency of a wave when
 

00:00:55.559 --> 00:00:56.990
notice in the frequency of a wave when
the source of that wave is moving

00:00:56.990 --> 00:00:57.000
the source of that wave is moving
 

00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.299
the source of that wave is moving
relative to you for example imagine that

00:00:59.299 --> 00:00:59.309
relative to you for example imagine that
 

00:00:59.309 --> 00:01:00.740
relative to you for example imagine that
you're sitting by a canal enjoying the

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:00.750
you're sitting by a canal enjoying the
 

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:04.759
you're sitting by a canal enjoying the
lovely British weather when suddenly I

00:01:04.759 --> 00:01:04.769
lovely British weather when suddenly I
 

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.679
lovely British weather when suddenly I
appear next to you screaming like a

00:01:06.679 --> 00:01:06.689
appear next to you screaming like a
 

00:01:06.689 --> 00:01:09.109
appear next to you screaming like a
lunatic from your perspective it's just

00:01:09.109 --> 00:01:09.119
lunatic from your perspective it's just
 

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.280
lunatic from your perspective it's just
really really weird

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:10.290
really really weird
 

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:12.020
really really weird
however if theoretically I wasn't

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:12.030
however if theoretically I wasn't
 

00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:13.190
however if theoretically I wasn't
standing next to you but was running

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
standing next to you but was running
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:15.560
standing next to you but was running
past you at 80 miles an hour still

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
past you at 80 miles an hour still
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:17.179
past you at 80 miles an hour still
screaming just as I was before as I

00:01:17.179 --> 00:01:17.189
screaming just as I was before as I
 

00:01:17.189 --> 00:01:18.530
screaming just as I was before as I
approach you the pitch of my screen

00:01:18.530 --> 00:01:18.540
approach you the pitch of my screen
 

00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:21.330
approach you the pitch of my screen
would be higher

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.340
 
 

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.370
 
and then as I pass and run away from you

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:23.380
and then as I pass and run away from you
 

00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:25.380
and then as I pass and run away from you
the pitch of my scream would drop even

00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:25.390
the pitch of my scream would drop even
 

00:01:25.390 --> 00:01:26.940
the pitch of my scream would drop even
though from my perspective I'm screaming

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:26.950
though from my perspective I'm screaming
 

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:28.770
though from my perspective I'm screaming
at exactly the same pitch as I was when

00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:28.780
at exactly the same pitch as I was when
 

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:29.849
at exactly the same pitch as I was when
I was standing still

00:01:29.849 --> 00:01:29.859
I was standing still
 

00:01:29.859 --> 00:01:32.099
I was standing still
the reason this shift in pitch happens

00:01:32.099 --> 00:01:32.109
the reason this shift in pitch happens
 

00:01:32.109 --> 00:01:33.510
the reason this shift in pitch happens
is because when I'm sitting still and

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:33.520
is because when I'm sitting still and
 

00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:37.709
is because when I'm sitting still and
screaming ah the sound waves are

00:01:37.709 --> 00:01:37.719
screaming ah the sound waves are
 

00:01:37.719 --> 00:01:39.690
screaming ah the sound waves are
emitting from my mouth uniformly but

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:39.700
emitting from my mouth uniformly but
 

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.069
emitting from my mouth uniformly but
when I start moving the sound waves in

00:01:41.069 --> 00:01:41.079
when I start moving the sound waves in
 

00:01:41.079 --> 00:01:42.719
when I start moving the sound waves in
front of me gets squished up and the

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729
front of me gets squished up and the
 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:44.309
front of me gets squished up and the
sound waves behind me get stretched out

00:01:44.309 --> 00:01:44.319
sound waves behind me get stretched out
 

00:01:44.319 --> 00:01:45.899
sound waves behind me get stretched out
and it's this change in the frequency

00:01:45.899 --> 00:01:45.909
and it's this change in the frequency
 

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:48.240
and it's this change in the frequency
that causes the change in pitch as I

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:48.250
that causes the change in pitch as I
 

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.730
that causes the change in pitch as I
pass and that is what the Doppler effect

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:50.740
pass and that is what the Doppler effect
 

00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:55.169
pass and that is what the Doppler effect
is the reason the Doppler effect is

00:01:55.169 --> 00:01:55.179
is the reason the Doppler effect is
 

00:01:55.179 --> 00:01:56.550
is the reason the Doppler effect is
important is because it doesn't just

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:56.560
important is because it doesn't just
 

00:01:56.560 --> 00:01:59.130
important is because it doesn't just
apply to sound but it also applies to

00:01:59.130 --> 00:01:59.140
apply to sound but it also applies to
 

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:02.160
apply to sound but it also applies to
light but you didn't see that one coming

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:02.170
light but you didn't see that one coming
 

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:04.199
light but you didn't see that one coming
kiss it's not a video about light or

00:02:04.199 --> 00:02:04.209
kiss it's not a video about light or
 

00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:06.359
kiss it's not a video about light or
anything like that is it oh so just as

00:02:06.359 --> 00:02:06.369
anything like that is it oh so just as
 

00:02:06.369 --> 00:02:07.709
anything like that is it oh so just as
when something is moving and emitting

00:02:07.709 --> 00:02:07.719
when something is moving and emitting
 

00:02:07.719 --> 00:02:09.089
when something is moving and emitting
sound you can hear a difference in the

00:02:09.089 --> 00:02:09.099
sound you can hear a difference in the
 

00:02:09.099 --> 00:02:10.559
sound you can hear a difference in the
pitch of that sound when something is

00:02:10.559 --> 00:02:10.569
pitch of that sound when something is
 

00:02:10.569 --> 00:02:13.020
pitch of that sound when something is
moving and emitting or reflecting light

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:13.030
moving and emitting or reflecting light
 

00:02:13.030 --> 00:02:15.509
moving and emitting or reflecting light
you can see a difference in the color of

00:02:15.509 --> 00:02:15.519
you can see a difference in the color of
 

00:02:15.519 --> 00:02:17.430
you can see a difference in the color of
that light for example imagine that

00:02:17.430 --> 00:02:17.440
that light for example imagine that
 

00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:18.960
that light for example imagine that
we're in exactly the same running canal

00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:18.970
we're in exactly the same running canal
 

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:20.400
we're in exactly the same running canal
situation as before it's at this time

00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:20.410
situation as before it's at this time
 

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:22.770
situation as before it's at this time
I'm not screaming like a lunatic and

00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:22.780
I'm not screaming like a lunatic and
 

00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:24.270
I'm not screaming like a lunatic and
instead of running at 80 miles an hour

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:24.280
instead of running at 80 miles an hour
 

00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:27.660
instead of running at 80 miles an hour
I'm running very very merely almost the

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:27.670
I'm running very very merely almost the
 

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:28.620
I'm running very very merely almost the
speed of light

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:28.630
speed of light
 

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:31.979
speed of light
what would you say well you probably

00:02:31.979 --> 00:02:31.989
what would you say well you probably
 

00:02:31.989 --> 00:02:33.569
what would you say well you probably
wouldn't see anything at all because as

00:02:33.569 --> 00:02:33.579
wouldn't see anything at all because as
 

00:02:33.579 --> 00:02:35.250
wouldn't see anything at all because as
you'll remember the speed of light is

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:35.260
you'll remember the speed of light is
 

00:02:35.260 --> 00:02:37.170
you'll remember the speed of light is
very very very fast and I'd be gone

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:37.180
very very very fast and I'd be gone
 

00:02:37.180 --> 00:02:38.729
very very very fast and I'd be gone
before you even knew I was there but

00:02:38.729 --> 00:02:38.739
before you even knew I was there but
 

00:02:38.739 --> 00:02:40.920
before you even knew I was there but
let's pretend that you had a magic

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:40.930
let's pretend that you had a magic
 

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:42.449
let's pretend that you had a magic
iPhone app that would let you take

00:02:42.449 --> 00:02:42.459
iPhone app that would let you take
 

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.160
iPhone app that would let you take
pictures of me traveling very nearly at

00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:44.170
pictures of me traveling very nearly at
 

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:45.539
pictures of me traveling very nearly at
the speed of light what would you see

00:02:45.539 --> 00:02:45.549
the speed of light what would you see
 

00:02:45.549 --> 00:02:46.920
the speed of light what would you see
well when I'm ready towards you the

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:46.930
well when I'm ready towards you the
 

00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.509
well when I'm ready towards you the
light in front of me gets squished and

00:02:48.509 --> 00:02:48.519
light in front of me gets squished and
 

00:02:48.519 --> 00:02:50.580
light in front of me gets squished and
the frequency of that light gets shifted

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:50.590
the frequency of that light gets shifted
 

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.319
the frequency of that light gets shifted
to the blue end of the visible light

00:02:52.319 --> 00:02:52.329
to the blue end of the visible light
 

00:02:52.329 --> 00:02:55.470
to the blue end of the visible light
spectrum and so I appear blue and then

00:02:55.470 --> 00:02:55.480
spectrum and so I appear blue and then
 

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.819
spectrum and so I appear blue and then
as you see me running away from you the

00:02:56.819 --> 00:02:56.829
as you see me running away from you the
 

00:02:56.829 --> 00:02:58.379
as you see me running away from you the
same thing happens in Reverse the light

00:02:58.379 --> 00:02:58.389
same thing happens in Reverse the light
 

00:02:58.389 --> 00:03:00.000
same thing happens in Reverse the light
behind me get stretched out shifts to

00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:00.010
behind me get stretched out shifts to
 

00:03:00.010 --> 00:03:01.650
