00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:40.440 align:start position:0%
would have made it better now I wouldn't
 

00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.930 align:start position:0%
would have made it better now I wouldn't

00:08:41.930 --> 00:08:41.940 align:start position:0%
save the movie no that's why I was
 

00:08:41.940 --> 00:08:43.520 align:start position:0%
save the movie no that's why I was
saying<00:08:42.120><c> what</c><00:08:42.300><c> it</c><00:08:42.390><c> would</c><00:08:42.719><c> it</c><00:08:42.810><c> have</c><00:08:42.930><c> saved</c><00:08:43.200><c> now</c><00:08:43.500><c> I</c>

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:43.530 align:start position:0%
saying what it would it have saved now I
 

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:44.690 align:start position:0%
saying what it would it have saved now I
wouldn't<00:08:43.860><c> have</c><00:08:43.950><c> saved</c><00:08:44.130><c> it</c><00:08:44.370><c> but</c><00:08:44.430><c> I</c><00:08:44.520><c> mean</c><00:08:44.670><c> I</c>

00:08:44.690 --> 00:08:44.700 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have saved it but I mean I
 

00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:46.230 align:start position:0%
wouldn't have saved it but I mean I
think<00:08:44.910><c> it</c><00:08:45.150><c> would</c><00:08:45.270><c> have</c><00:08:45.360><c> been</c><00:08:45.450><c> better</c><00:08:45.660><c> and</c>

00:08:46.230 --> 00:08:46.240 align:start position:0%
think it would have been better and
 

00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:47.790 align:start position:0%
think it would have been better and
I<00:08:46.300><c> think</c><00:08:46.899><c> would</c><00:08:46.959><c> have</c><00:08:47.050><c> been</c><00:08:47.170><c> a</c><00:08:47.200><c> little</c><00:08:47.470><c> less</c>

00:08:47.790 --> 00:08:47.800 align:start position:0%
I think would have been a little less
 

00:08:47.800 --> 00:08:51.060 align:start position:0%
I think would have been a little less
