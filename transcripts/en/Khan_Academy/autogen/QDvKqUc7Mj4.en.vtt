00:00:00.518 --> 00:00:02.528
 We need to move the orange dot 

00:00:02.528 --> 00:00:06.967
 to the number equal to 5 by 1/3. 

00:00:06.967 --> 00:00:08.775
 One way to think about it, 

00:00:08.775 --> 00:00:11.825
 is that we need 5 times to move 1/3. 

00:00:11.825 --> 00:00:14.033
 Let's do it once, 

00:00:14.033 --> 00:00:15.488
 this will be 1/3, 

00:00:15.488 --> 00:00:17.520
 we do it a second time, we get 2/3, 

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.213
 the third time and we get 3/3, 

00:00:20.213 --> 00:00:23.000
 fourth time and we get 4/3, 

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.529
 fifth time and we get 5/3. 

00:00:25.529 --> 00:00:30.608
 5 per 1/3 will be equal to 5/3. 

00:00:30.608 --> 00:00:32.651
 Or you can say 5 per 1/3, 

00:00:32.651 --> 00:00:34.933
 which is equal to 5/3, 

00:00:34.933 --> 00:00:36.776
 I hope that makes sense. 

00:00:36.776 --> 00:00:39.509
 Let's do a few other examples. 

00:00:39.509 --> 00:00:41.224
 Let's say we have to find, 

00:00:41.224 --> 00:00:43.261
 to see, we need to move the orange dot 

00:00:43.261 --> 00:00:47.274
 of the number equal to 2 by 4/3. 

00:00:47.274 --> 00:00:52.244
 Okay, once 4/3 will take us to 4/3, 

00:00:52.244 --> 00:00:54.583
 once again 4/3, 

00:00:54.583 --> 00:00:56.120
 we will add 4/3 to this, 

00:00:56.120 --> 00:00:58.520
 we will move another 4/3 to the right. 

00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:02.848
 4/3 plus 4/3 will give us 8/3. 

00:01:02.848 --> 00:01:06.210
 8/3, it's hard to move it, 8/3. 

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:09.318
 1 in 4/3 is 4/3, 

00:01:09.318 --> 00:01:12.615
 and 2 in 4/3 is 8/3. 

00:01:12.615 --> 00:01:15.600
 Note that this is the same as 2 in 4, 

00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:18.953
 which is 8, on 3, 8/3. 

00:01:18.953 --> 00:01:21.184
 Let's do another example. 

00:01:21.184 --> 00:01:23.189
 We have to move the orange dot to the number, 

00:01:23.189 --> 00:01:26.296
 which is equal to 3 by 3/2. 

00:01:26.296 --> 00:01:29.443
 This will be 0/2, it's just 0, 

00:01:29.443 --> 00:01:31.992
 you can do this by 3/2. 

00:01:31.992 --> 00:01:35.933
 1 by 3/2, this will take us to 3/2. 

00:01:35.933 --> 00:01:38.743
 2 by 3/2, we add another 3/2, 

00:01:38.743 --> 00:01:41.170
 and we get 6/2. 

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.797
 Then 3 by 3/2, 

00:01:42.797 --> 00:01:44.371
 add another 3/2, 

00:01:44.371 --> 00:01:48.813
 we get 9/2 and we're ready.
