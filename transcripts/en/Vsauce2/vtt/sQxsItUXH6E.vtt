00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:05.200
Researchers in Australia have created flexible
material with nanoscale glass structures that

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:06.410
can manipulate light.

00:00:06.410 --> 00:00:11.580
A potential precursor to smart contact lenses
that display information.

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:16.679
And RetroSense Therapeutics will inject viruses
loaded with the DNA of light-sensitive algae

00:00:16.679 --> 00:00:21.840
into the eye of a legally blind person in
the hopes of restoring their sight, in black

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:23.160
and white.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:24.160
Vsauce!

00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:27.810
Kevin here - this is Mind Blow.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:33.580
This may be the most human-like robot hand
ever made.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.500
Researchers from the University of Washington
created the anthropomorphic robot hand by

00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:42.719
laser-scanning the bones of a human hand and
3D printing artificial replicas.

00:00:42.719 --> 00:00:45.710
And finally connecting them with artificial
finger joints.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:50.190
It’s controlled by 10 servos that act as
muscles with cable that replicates the carpal

00:00:50.190 --> 00:00:51.190
tunnel.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:55.370
And the hope is that someday this system could
be used as a scaffold for the growth of grafted

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:59.000
cells to regenerate human hands.

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:03.790
Tiny quartz discs could store data for billions
of years.

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:08.660
First detailed in 2011, it stores data via
laser-etched nanostructures which can be read

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:13.090
by passing light through the crystal and having
an automated microscope algorithm translate

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:14.280
the light changes.

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:18.930
The U.K. researchers now have a working prototype
and the next step is to speed up the write

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:24.640
time as well as the read time of the discs
that can store 360 terabytes, can withstand

00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:31.040
temperatures up to 1,000 degrees and have
a room temperature lifespan of 13.8 Billion

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:32.040
years.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.140
To free up traffic, Switzerland is considering
a special tunnel for automated delivery trucks.

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:41.510
A three-lane tunnel, located 50 (164 feet)
meters underground would allow passage for

00:01:41.510 --> 00:01:43.630
the electric delivery vehicles.

00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:47.930
The idea is to completely eliminate big trucks
in urban areas and replace them with much

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.920
smaller trucks that do the basic point A to
point B delivery.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.550
But first some private financing needs to
foot the $3.4 billion dollar bill and if that

00:01:56.550 --> 00:01:59.380
does happen - the earliest it would open is
2030.

00:01:59.380 --> 00:02:04.610
Here’s an artist’s rendering of the first
successfully-analyzed atmosphere of a super-Earth.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.070
A super-Earth is a planet outside of our solar
system with a mass higher than Earths but

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.290
much lower than gas giants like Neptune.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:17.350
Researchers from the University College London
recently analyzed 55 Cancri e’s atmosphere

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:20.680
and discovered it consists mainly of helium
and hydrogen.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.290
And due to orbiting so close to its sun its
at least 2,000 degrees (3,632 f) there.

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:29.600
Tectonic Technologies is developing pressure-sensing
mats for virtual reality.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:34.500
They use hundreds of small force plates - with
measured data sent to a computer that translates

00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.350
real-time reactions in the game.

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:40.290
They’ve used it to simulate flying, bending,
shifting weight and stepping.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:43.780
And they hope to start selling these by the
end of 2016.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.390
Scientists from the National Institute of
Polar Research revived Antarctic tardigrades

00:02:48.390 --> 00:02:51.120
frozen for over 30 years.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:56.310
Taken from frozen moss in 1983 and stored
at minus 20 degrees C, the samples were recently

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.340
defrosted.

00:02:57.340 --> 00:03:02.080
The tardigrades essentially woke up from suspended
animation, ate some algae - and went on to

00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:04.080
successfully reproduce.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:05.400
So yeah.

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.100
In the spirit of using robots to augment human
ability - researchers at Georgia Tech created

00:03:10.100 --> 00:03:11.380
a three armed drummer.

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:16.390
The smart arm responds not only to gestures
but also the music it hears.

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:20.640
So for example, if the drummer moves to play
the high hat - the smart arm adjusts to play

00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:21.910
the ride cymbal.

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:27.960
The drummer scenario used as a proof of concept
because it's reliant upon precise, timed movements

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:32.790
but this idea could be eventually implemented
on doctors, mechanics, or technicians who

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.320
could use an extra hand.

00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.920
The next steps are to link the movements to
directly to the user’s brain.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:43.560
I featured a soft wearable robotic glove in
Mind Blow #96 developed at Harvard but this

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:48.740
new Exo-Glove from Seoul National University
is more compact and more comfortable.

00:03:48.740 --> 00:03:54.020
The flexible, waterproof polymer soft robot
is tendon driven using actuators and allows

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:58.080
grasping of various objects for people with
hand disabilities.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:03.610
Finally, HydroMorph is a water-shaping device
for display and interaction.

00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:07.690
Potential applications include the water purposefully
avoiding your hands if the temperature is

00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:11.970
too hot, or showing you different shapes to
indicate the weather or if the water is safe

00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:12.970
to drink.

00:04:12.970 --> 00:04:15.600
Honestly, I’m showing you this just because
I think it looks cool.

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:26.950
I’m gonna leave you with a full-scale spacecraft
drop test - and as always - thanks for watching.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:52.400
New ways of living and new thinking have laid
the foundation for most of what is good in

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:53.400
life today.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.970
With the promise of more tomorrow.

00:04:57.970 --> 00:05:04.190
As distant families have become neighbors,
and as people have constantly widened their

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:36.830
viewpoints, while multiplying the number of
their contacts, more desires have developed,

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.930
to be satisfied.
