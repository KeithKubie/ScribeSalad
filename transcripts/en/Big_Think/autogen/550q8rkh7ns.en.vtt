so Oscar you asked the question what are

00:00:12.850 --> 00:00:12.860
so Oscar you asked the question what are
 

00:00:12.860 --> 00:00:14.619
so Oscar you asked the question what are
some of the easiest ways that you can

00:00:14.619 --> 00:00:14.629
some of the easiest ways that you can
 

00:00:14.629 --> 00:00:16.660
some of the easiest ways that you can
prove that the earth is round because

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:16.670
prove that the earth is round because
 

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:17.950
prove that the earth is round because
apparently this is something that we're

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:17.960
apparently this is something that we're
 

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:20.740
apparently this is something that we're
debating I have no idea why that's a

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:20.750
debating I have no idea why that's a
 

00:00:20.750 --> 00:00:22.420
debating I have no idea why that's a
hard thing for me to even start talking

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:22.430
hard thing for me to even start talking
 

00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:24.940
hard thing for me to even start talking
about because there are so many proofs

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:24.950
about because there are so many proofs
 

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.340
about because there are so many proofs
that the earth is round it's difficult

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:27.350
that the earth is round it's difficult
 

00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:30.160
that the earth is round it's difficult
to know where to start and it's not okay

00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:30.170
to know where to start and it's not okay
 

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:32.770
to know where to start and it's not okay
to think that the earth is flat this is

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:32.780
to think that the earth is flat this is
 

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:36.040
to think that the earth is flat this is
not a viable argument I have friends who

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:36.050
not a viable argument I have friends who
 

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:37.119
not a viable argument I have friends who
have been on the International Space

00:00:37.119 --> 00:00:37.129
have been on the International Space
 

00:00:37.129 --> 00:00:38.979

Station they have orbited the earth once

00:00:38.979 --> 00:00:38.989
Station they have orbited the earth once
 

00:00:38.989 --> 00:00:41.229

every 90 minutes you know I have had

00:00:41.229 --> 00:00:41.239
every 90 minutes you know I have had
 

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.389
every 90 minutes you know I have had
personal experience with people that

00:00:43.389 --> 00:00:43.399
personal experience with people that
 

00:00:43.399 --> 00:00:45.400
personal experience with people that
have been up in space and can see with

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:45.410
have been up in space and can see with
 

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:47.200
have been up in space and can see with
their own eyes that the earth is round

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210
their own eyes that the earth is round
 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.090
their own eyes that the earth is round
and of course we've taken all of these

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:49.100
and of course we've taken all of these
 

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:51.400
and of course we've taken all of these
amazing pictures from space that they're

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:51.410
amazing pictures from space that they're
 

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:52.840
amazing pictures from space that they're
so beautiful all those pictures of the

00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:52.850
so beautiful all those pictures of the
 

00:00:52.850 --> 00:00:55.600
so beautiful all those pictures of the
earth so I don't really know what's

00:00:55.600 --> 00:00:55.610
earth so I don't really know what's
 

00:00:55.610 --> 00:00:57.310
earth so I don't really know what's
going on right now with this earth is

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:57.320
going on right now with this earth is
 

00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.040
going on right now with this earth is
flat thing but I will tell you that this

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:00.050
flat thing but I will tell you that this
 

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:01.479
flat thing but I will tell you that this
is one of the things I really enjoyed

00:01:01.479 --> 00:01:01.489
is one of the things I really enjoyed
 

00:01:01.489 --> 00:01:03.580
is one of the things I really enjoyed
teaching my own astronomy class about

00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:03.590
teaching my own astronomy class about
 

00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.490

because there are proofs all around you

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:06.500
because there are proofs all around you
 

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.830
because there are proofs all around you
is not difficult to know that the earth

00:01:08.830 --> 00:01:08.840
is not difficult to know that the earth
 

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.140
is not difficult to know that the earth
is round in fact people have known this

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:11.150
is round in fact people have known this
 

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:14.680
is round in fact people have known this
for way more than 2,000 years the

00:01:14.680 --> 00:01:14.690
for way more than 2,000 years the
 

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:16.180
for way more than 2,000 years the
ancient Greeks actually had a number of

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:16.190
ancient Greeks actually had a number of
 

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.940
ancient Greeks actually had a number of
really elegant wonderful proofs that the

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:18.950
really elegant wonderful proofs that the
 

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:20.950
really elegant wonderful proofs that the
earth was a sphere so let's start from

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:20.960
earth was a sphere so let's start from
 

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:22.149
earth was a sphere so let's start from
the simple to the slightly more

00:01:22.149 --> 00:01:22.159
the simple to the slightly more
 

00:01:22.159 --> 00:01:24.399
the simple to the slightly more
complicated one of the things you can

00:01:24.399 --> 00:01:24.409
complicated one of the things you can
 

00:01:24.409 --> 00:01:25.750
complicated one of the things you can
see yourself with a pair of binoculars

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:25.760
see yourself with a pair of binoculars
 

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:29.289
see yourself with a pair of binoculars
is if you actually go out to a lake and

00:01:29.289 --> 00:01:29.299
is if you actually go out to a lake and
 

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:32.500
is if you actually go out to a lake and
there are boats on that lake the farther

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:32.510
there are boats on that lake the farther
 

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:35.200
there are boats on that lake the farther
away a boat is the more the bottom of

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:35.210
away a boat is the more the bottom of
 

00:01:35.210 --> 00:01:36.760
away a boat is the more the bottom of
the boat will disappear and you'll

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:36.770
the boat will disappear and you'll
 

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.469
the boat will disappear and you'll
basically just see the mast of the boat

00:01:38.469 --> 00:01:38.479
basically just see the mast of the boat
 

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:40.630
basically just see the mast of the boat
and as a boat goes farther and farther

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:40.640
and as a boat goes farther and farther
 

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:42.940
and as a boat goes farther and farther
away the last thing you will see is the

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:42.950
away the last thing you will see is the
 

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:45.460
away the last thing you will see is the
very top of the mast of that boat and

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:45.470
very top of the mast of that boat and
 

00:01:45.470 --> 00:01:46.899
very top of the mast of that boat and
that's because the boat is actually

00:01:46.899 --> 00:01:46.909
that's because the boat is actually
 

00:01:46.909 --> 00:01:49.870
that's because the boat is actually
going over the horizon that's curved and

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:49.880
going over the horizon that's curved and
 

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.120
going over the horizon that's curved and
that means that as it goes farther and

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:52.130
that means that as it goes farther and
 

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:54.219
that means that as it goes farther and
farther away you see less and less of

00:01:54.219 --> 00:01:54.229
farther away you see less and less of
 

00:01:54.229 --> 00:01:56.170
farther away you see less and less of
the bottom of it and more of the top of

00:01:56.170 --> 00:01:56.180
the bottom of it and more of the top of
 

00:01:56.180 --> 00:01:58.810
the bottom of it and more of the top of
that you can see that with binoculars by

00:01:58.810 --> 00:01:58.820
that you can see that with binoculars by
 

00:01:58.820 --> 00:02:01.240
that you can see that with binoculars by
an ocean by a lake it's really easy that

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:01.250
an ocean by a lake it's really easy that
 

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:03.219
an ocean by a lake it's really easy that
wouldn't happen if the earth were flat

00:02:03.219 --> 00:02:03.229
wouldn't happen if the earth were flat
 

00:02:03.229 --> 00:02:05.170
wouldn't happen if the earth were flat
you would simply see the boat getting

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:05.180
you would simply see the boat getting
 

00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:06.969
you would simply see the boat getting
smaller and smaller and smaller as it

00:02:06.969 --> 00:02:06.979
smaller and smaller and smaller as it
 

00:02:06.979 --> 00:02:08.679
smaller and smaller and smaller as it
went farther away but you'd be able to

00:02:08.679 --> 00:02:08.689
went farther away but you'd be able to
 

00:02:08.689 --> 00:02:10.389
went farther away but you'd be able to
see the whole thing with the same

00:02:10.389 --> 00:02:10.399
see the whole thing with the same
 

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.449
see the whole thing with the same
proportions now another way that you can

00:02:13.449 --> 00:02:13.459
proportions now another way that you can
 

00:02:13.459 --> 00:02:16.659
proportions now another way that you can
tell that we're on a sphere is to think

00:02:16.659 --> 00:02:16.669
tell that we're on a sphere is to think
 

00:02:16.669 --> 00:02:19.300
tell that we're on a sphere is to think
about how there's something called the

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:19.310
about how there's something called the
 

00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.000
about how there's something called the

places near the equator of the earth

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:23.480
places near the equator of the earth
 

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.809
places near the equator of the earth
where sometimes the Sun is overhead in

00:02:25.809 --> 00:02:25.819
where sometimes the Sun is overhead in
 

00:02:25.819 --> 00:02:28.390
where sometimes the Sun is overhead in
the sky and this was actually something

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:28.400
the sky and this was actually something
 

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.970
the sky and this was actually something
that the Greeks used not only to prove

00:02:30.970 --> 00:02:30.980
that the Greeks used not only to prove
 

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:33.670
that the Greeks used not only to prove
that the earth was around about 2,000

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:33.680
that the earth was around about 2,000
 

00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.040
that the earth was around about 2,000
years ago but they actually measured the

00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.050
years ago but they actually measured the
 

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.110
years ago but they actually measured the
circumference of the earth accurate to

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:38.120
circumference of the earth accurate to
 

00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.030
circumference of the earth accurate to
within just a couple percent two

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:40.040
within just a couple percent two
 

00:02:40.040 --> 00:02:41.949
within just a couple percent two
thousand years ago we've known that the

00:02:41.949 --> 00:02:41.959
thousand years ago we've known that the
 

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:43.930
thousand years ago we've known that the
earth was round there was a really

00:02:43.930 --> 00:02:43.940
earth was round there was a really
 

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:45.400
earth was round there was a really

Aristophanes and Aristophanes noticed

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380
Aristophanes and Aristophanes noticed
 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:51.070
Aristophanes and Aristophanes noticed
that there was a town called Sian and on

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.080
that there was a town called Sian and on
 

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.949
that there was a town called Sian and on
a certain date the Sun would actually

00:02:53.949 --> 00:02:53.959
a certain date the Sun would actually
 

00:02:53.959 --> 00:02:56.080
a certain date the Sun would actually
shine straight down to the bottom of a

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:56.090
shine straight down to the bottom of a
 

00:02:56.090 --> 00:02:58.479
shine straight down to the bottom of a
well that meant the Sun was directly

00:02:58.479 --> 00:02:58.489
well that meant the Sun was directly
 

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:00.580
well that meant the Sun was directly
overhead you could look down a well and

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:00.590
overhead you could look down a well and
 

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:03.460
overhead you could look down a well and
see the sun shining back at you and on

00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:03.470
see the sun shining back at you and on
 

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:06.280
see the sun shining back at you and on
the very same date farther away in the

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:06.290
the very same date farther away in the
 

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:08.259
the very same date farther away in the
city of Alexandria that didn't happen

00:03:08.259 --> 00:03:08.269
city of Alexandria that didn't happen
 

00:03:08.269 --> 00:03:10.720
city of Alexandria that didn't happen
the Sun was not directly overhead it was

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:10.730
the Sun was not directly overhead it was
 

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.720
the Sun was not directly overhead it was
a slight angle and all the Aristophanes

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:13.730
a slight angle and all the Aristophanes
 

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:16.059
a slight angle and all the Aristophanes
did was he measured the difference in

00:03:16.059 --> 00:03:16.069
did was he measured the difference in
 

00:03:16.069 --> 00:03:18.580
did was he measured the difference in
the angle of the Sun it was straight

00:03:18.580 --> 00:03:18.590
the angle of the Sun it was straight
 

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.729
the angle of the Sun it was straight
overhead and Syene in Alexandria it was

00:03:21.729 --> 00:03:21.739
overhead and Syene in Alexandria it was
 

00:03:21.739 --> 00:03:24.460
overhead and Syene in Alexandria it was
a little bit less than overhead and he

00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:24.470
a little bit less than overhead and he
 

00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:27.039
a little bit less than overhead and he
rationed that that change in angle from

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:27.049
rationed that that change in angle from
 

00:03:27.049 --> 00:03:29.319
rationed that that change in angle from
one city to another was probably

00:03:29.319 --> 00:03:29.329
one city to another was probably
 

00:03:29.329 --> 00:03:31.120
one city to another was probably
indicative of us being on a curved

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:31.130
indicative of us being on a curved
 

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.580
indicative of us being on a curved
surface and you could make all kinds of

00:03:33.580 --> 00:03:33.590
surface and you could make all kinds of
 

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.259
surface and you could make all kinds of
measurements even between those two

00:03:35.259 --> 00:03:35.269
measurements even between those two
 

00:03:35.269 --> 00:03:37.090
measurements even between those two
cities and see that the angles were

00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:37.100
cities and see that the angles were
 

00:03:37.100 --> 00:03:38.500
cities and see that the angles were
different the Sun was at a different

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:38.510
different the Sun was at a different
 

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.380
different the Sun was at a different
place in the sky using this he actually

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:41.390
place in the sky using this he actually
 

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:43.000
place in the sky using this he actually
measured the circumference of the earth

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:43.010
measured the circumference of the earth
 

00:03:43.010 --> 00:03:44.289
measured the circumference of the earth
and he got it right

00:03:44.289 --> 00:03:44.299
and he got it right
 

00:03:44.299 --> 00:03:46.870
and he got it right
2,000 years ago so another really simple

00:03:46.870 --> 00:03:46.880
2,000 years ago so another really simple
 

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.300
2,000 years ago so another really simple
proof is that on any given date at

00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:49.310
proof is that on any given date at
 

00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:51.099
proof is that on any given date at
different cities and different places

00:03:51.099 --> 00:03:51.109
different cities and different places
 

00:03:51.109 --> 00:03:53.020
different cities and different places
around the world the Sun is at different

00:03:53.020 --> 00:03:53.030
around the world the Sun is at different
 

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:55.090
around the world the Sun is at different
angles in the sky that wouldn't happen

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100
angles in the sky that wouldn't happen
 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.699
angles in the sky that wouldn't happen
if the earth wasn't round then there are

00:03:57.699 --> 00:03:57.709
if the earth wasn't round then there are
 

00:03:57.709 --> 00:03:58.960
if the earth wasn't round then there are
some other proofs that are a little more

00:03:58.960 --> 00:03:58.970
some other proofs that are a little more
 

00:03:58.970 --> 00:04:00.099
some other proofs that are a little more
obscure but they're actually really

00:04:00.099 --> 00:04:00.109
obscure but they're actually really
 

00:04:00.109 --> 00:04:02.560
obscure but they're actually really
lovely and one is to observe what

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:02.570
lovely and one is to observe what
 

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:05.530
lovely and one is to observe what
happens during a lunar eclipse now a

00:04:05.530 --> 00:04:05.540
happens during a lunar eclipse now a
 

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.620
happens during a lunar eclipse now a
lunar eclipse happens when the earth

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:07.630
lunar eclipse happens when the earth
 

00:04:07.630 --> 00:04:10.479
lunar eclipse happens when the earth
casts a shadow on the moon the moon

00:04:10.479 --> 00:04:10.489
casts a shadow on the moon the moon
 

00:04:10.489 --> 00:04:12.220
casts a shadow on the moon the moon
actually goes dark in fact if you've

00:04:12.220 --> 00:04:12.230
actually goes dark in fact if you've
 

00:04:12.230 --> 00:04:13.870
actually goes dark in fact if you've
seen one you can actually see the earth

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:13.880
seen one you can actually see the earth
 

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:16.360
seen one you can actually see the earth
shadow go across the moon and when the

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:16.370
shadow go across the moon and when the
 

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:17.890
shadow go across the moon and when the
moon is entirely in the Earth's shadow

00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:17.900
moon is entirely in the Earth's shadow
 

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:19.659
moon is entirely in the Earth's shadow
the moon looks kind of dark and even

00:04:19.659 --> 00:04:19.669
the moon looks kind of dark and even
 

00:04:19.669 --> 00:04:21.310
the moon looks kind of dark and even
kind of red colored it's really really

00:04:21.310 --> 00:04:21.320
kind of red colored it's really really
 

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.849
kind of red colored it's really really
beautiful

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859
beautiful
 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.370
beautiful
what's happening in that case is that

00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:24.380
what's happening in that case is that
 

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.200
what's happening in that case is that
the Sun is on one side of the earth

00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:26.210
the Sun is on one side of the earth
 

00:04:26.210 --> 00:04:28.330
the Sun is on one side of the earth
there this in the middle and it's

00:04:28.330 --> 00:04:28.340
there this in the middle and it's
 

00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:30.399
there this in the middle and it's
casting a shadow the earth is casting a

00:04:30.399 --> 00:04:30.409
casting a shadow the earth is casting a
 

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:32.320
casting a shadow the earth is casting a
shadow on the moon and

00:04:32.320 --> 00:04:32.330
shadow on the moon and
 

00:04:32.330 --> 00:04:34.119
shadow on the moon and
as the shadow moves across the moon

00:04:34.119 --> 00:04:34.129
as the shadow moves across the moon
 

00:04:34.129 --> 00:04:36.580
as the shadow moves across the moon
you'll notice that the shadow is curved

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:36.590
you'll notice that the shadow is curved
 

00:04:36.590 --> 00:04:38.920
you'll notice that the shadow is curved
it's round so something like the Sun

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:38.930
it's round so something like the Sun
 

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:40.719
it's round so something like the Sun
that's bigger than the earth and is able

00:04:40.719 --> 00:04:40.729
that's bigger than the earth and is able
 

00:04:40.729 --> 00:04:42.279
that's bigger than the earth and is able
to cast a shadow of the earth on the

00:04:42.279 --> 00:04:42.289
to cast a shadow of the earth on the
 

00:04:42.289 --> 00:04:44.230
to cast a shadow of the earth on the
moon can actually show you the shape of

00:04:44.230 --> 00:04:44.240
moon can actually show you the shape of
 

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:46.540
moon can actually show you the shape of
the earth a high you might say but could

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:46.550
the earth a high you might say but could
 

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:49.089
the earth a high you might say but could
the earth be a disc could it be flat but

00:04:49.089 --> 00:04:49.099
the earth be a disc could it be flat but
 

00:04:49.099 --> 00:04:50.890
the earth be a disc could it be flat but
it's actually still shaped like a disc

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:50.900
it's actually still shaped like a disc
 

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.959
it's actually still shaped like a disc
not like a sphere there was a Greek

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:52.969
not like a sphere there was a Greek
 

00:04:52.969 --> 00:04:55.179
not like a sphere there was a Greek
scientist called Aristarchus and what he

00:04:55.179 --> 00:04:55.189
scientist called Aristarchus and what he
 

00:04:55.189 --> 00:04:57.189
scientist called Aristarchus and what he
noticed was that you can get a lunar

00:04:57.189 --> 00:04:57.199
noticed was that you can get a lunar
 

00:04:57.199 --> 00:04:59.350
noticed was that you can get a lunar
eclipse at many different angles where

00:04:59.350 --> 00:04:59.360
eclipse at many different angles where
 

00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.450
eclipse at many different angles where
the Sun is sometimes the shadow goes

00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:01.460
the Sun is sometimes the shadow goes
 

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:03.760
the Sun is sometimes the shadow goes
straight across the moon sometimes it

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:03.770
straight across the moon sometimes it
 

00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:05.230
straight across the moon sometimes it
just kind of glances the moon just a

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:05.240
just kind of glances the moon just a
 

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:06.850
just kind of glances the moon just a
little bit as in shadow just on the top

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:06.860
little bit as in shadow just on the top
 

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.309

the Sun is casting a shadow
you always get a perfectly curved shadow

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:16.190
you always get a perfectly curved shadow
 

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.909
you always get a perfectly curved shadow
the only shape that can cast a shadow

00:05:18.909 --> 00:05:18.919
the only shape that can cast a shadow
 

00:05:18.919 --> 00:05:22.089
the only shape that can cast a shadow
that's curved from any direction you put

00:05:22.089 --> 00:05:22.099
that's curved from any direction you put
 

00:05:22.099 --> 00:05:25.450
that's curved from any direction you put
the light is a sphere so people have

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:25.460
the light is a sphere so people have
 

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:27.519
the light is a sphere so people have
known that the earth is spherical for

00:05:27.519 --> 00:05:27.529
known that the earth is spherical for
 

00:05:27.529 --> 00:05:30.610
known that the earth is spherical for
thousands of years it's not okay to say

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:30.620
thousands of years it's not okay to say
 

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:32.980
thousands of years it's not okay to say
that the earth is flat this is some sort

00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:32.990
that the earth is flat this is some sort
 

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:35.230
that the earth is flat this is some sort
of strange denial I don't know where it

00:05:35.230 --> 00:05:35.240
of strange denial I don't know where it
 

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:37.180
of strange denial I don't know where it
comes from and it's something where I

00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:37.190
comes from and it's something where I
 

00:05:37.190 --> 00:05:39.430
comes from and it's something where I
keep getting this question we really

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:39.440
keep getting this question we really
 

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:40.990
keep getting this question we really
need to put this question to bed because

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:41.000
need to put this question to bed because
 

00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.550
need to put this question to bed because
we've known the earth as a sphere for a

we've known the earth as a sphere for a
 

00:05:42.560 --> 00:05:45.999
we've known the earth as a sphere for a
long time there there's some even

00:05:45.999 --> 00:05:46.009
long time there there's some even
 

00:05:46.009 --> 00:05:48.100
long time there there's some even
well-meaning people that have kind of

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:48.110
well-meaning people that have kind of
 

00:05:48.110 --> 00:05:49.450
well-meaning people that have kind of
you know they say well I don't really

00:05:49.450 --> 00:05:49.460
you know they say well I don't really
 

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:51.249
you know they say well I don't really
believe the earth is flat but I'm not

00:05:51.249 --> 00:05:51.259
believe the earth is flat but I'm not
 

00:05:51.259 --> 00:05:52.570
believe the earth is flat but I'm not
really sure at what to think about it

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:52.580
really sure at what to think about it
 

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:54.040
really sure at what to think about it
and they've asked me some interesting

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:54.050
and they've asked me some interesting
 

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:57.100
and they've asked me some interesting
questions like you know they've heard

00:05:57.100 --> 00:05:57.110
questions like you know they've heard
 

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:59.170
questions like you know they've heard
that the that space is very hot you know

00:05:59.170 --> 00:05:59.180
that the that space is very hot you know
 

00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.329
that the that space is very hot you know
that when you when you go up above the

00:06:01.329 --> 00:06:01.339
that when you when you go up above the
 

00:06:01.339 --> 00:06:02.950
that when you when you go up above the
atmosphere the temperature space is

00:06:02.950 --> 00:06:02.960
atmosphere the temperature space is
 

00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.439
atmosphere the temperature space is
millions of degrees which is true the

millions of degrees which is true the
 

00:06:05.449 --> 00:06:08.110
millions of degrees which is true the
the problem is there's basically no air

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:08.120
the problem is there's basically no air
 

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:10.029
the problem is there's basically no air
at all so I mean I mean the the gas

00:06:10.029 --> 00:06:10.039
at all so I mean I mean the the gas
 

00:06:10.039 --> 00:06:11.409
at all so I mean I mean the the gas
right around the earth is actually

00:06:11.409 --> 00:06:11.419
right around the earth is actually

right around the earth is actually
millions of degrees hot that's actually

millions of degrees hot that's actually
 

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:15.279
millions of degrees hot that's actually
true but there's almost none of it it's

00:06:15.279 --> 00:06:15.289
true but there's almost none of it it's
 

00:06:15.289 --> 00:06:17.350
true but there's almost none of it it's
almost nothing like one single proton

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:17.360
almost nothing like one single proton

temperature like in the air it's not the
 

00:06:23.569 --> 00:06:26.649
