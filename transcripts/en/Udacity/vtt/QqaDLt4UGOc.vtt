00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:02.234
Recall from an earlier lesson that one

00:00:02.234 --> 00:00:04.970
of the internet's fundamental design tenants is packet

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.910
switching. In a packet switch network, resources are

00:00:08.910 --> 00:00:12.340
not reserved and packets are self containment. Every

00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:15.370
packet has a destination IP address, and each

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:18.810
packet travels independently to the destination host. In

00:00:18.810 --> 00:00:21.010
a packet switch network, a link may be

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:25.140
shared by multiple senders at any given time,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.210
using statistical multiplexing as we learned in previous

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:31.690
lessons. Well packet switch networks have their advantages, in

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:35.430
particular it makes it easy to achieve high utilization

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.960
on a shared link, packet switch networks also have

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:41.620
the drawback that A large number of senders can

00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:44.580
overload a network resource, such as a node or

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.640
a link. Note that circuit switch networks like the

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:50.410
phone network do not have this problem because every

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:55.840
connection effectively has allocated, dedicated resources.

00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.530
For that particular connection until it

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:02.380
is terminated. So this problem that an attacker who sends allot of traffic

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.519
might exhaust resources is unique to

00:01:05.519 --> 00:01:08.600
a packet switched network environment. So packet

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.220
switched networks are extremely vulnerable to

00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:15.740
resource exhaustion attacks. Resource exhaustion Attacks a

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:19.530
basic component of security known as availability.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:21.320
Let's take a look at other component of

00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:24.920
security as well. In addition to Availability, we

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:27.740
would like the network to provide Confidentiality. For

00:01:27.740 --> 00:01:32.080
example, if you're performing a sensitive banking transaction

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:35.050
or having a private conversation. With a friend.

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.740
You'd like the Internet to provide some level

00:01:36.740 --> 00:01:40.640
of confidentiality. Another component of security is Authenticity.

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:43.600
Authenticity ensures the identity of the origin of

00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.050
a piece of information. So, for example, if you're

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:49.770
reading a particular news article, you really may want

00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.980
to know that the article came From the New

00:01:51.980 --> 00:01:55.150
York Times website. As oppose to, from some other

00:01:55.150 --> 00:01:58.030
place on the internet. Similarly, you might want to

00:01:58.030 --> 00:02:01.120
know that, that information wasn't modified in flight. That

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:06.020
property is called Integrity. Which prevents unauthorized changes to

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:11.300
information as it traverses the network Now a security threat is

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:16.220
anything that might potentially cause a violation of one of these

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:21.330
properties. An attack, on the other hand, is an action that results

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:23.490
in the violation of one of these security

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:25.610
properties. So the difference between a threat and an

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.030
attack, is simply the difference between a violation

00:02:28.030 --> 00:02:31.560
that could potentially occur. Versus an action that actually

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:36.230
results in a violation. let's look at a couple example attacks on

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.780
different components of security. let's start

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.000
by looking at an attack on Confidentiality.
