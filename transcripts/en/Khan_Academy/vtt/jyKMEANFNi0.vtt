00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:08.550
The 4 in the number
5,634 is blank times

00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.912
blank than the 4 in
the number 12,749.

00:00:13.912 --> 00:00:15.620
So let's think about
what they're saying.

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:19.250
So the 4 in the number 5,634,
that's literally in the ones

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.750
place.

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:22.250
It literally just represents 4.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:27.900
Now, the 4 in the number 12,749,
that 4 is in the tens place.

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.220
It represents 40.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:40.290
So this 4, it's a 10 times
smaller value than this 4.

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:41.490
Or this 4, I should say.

00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:43.920
This 4 right over
here represents 4,

00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:46.850
while this represents 40.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:56.030
So it is 10 times smaller
than the 4 in 12,749.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:01:01.010
4 by itself is 10
times smaller than 40.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.536
Make sure I got
the right answer.

00:01:02.536 --> 00:01:03.410
Let's do another one.

00:01:08.410 --> 00:01:16.000
In the number 3,779,264,
how many times less

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.740
is the value of the second 7
than the value of the first 7?

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.320
How many times less is
the value of the second 7

00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:25.570
than the value of the first 7?

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.650
So the second 7 right over here,
that's in the ten thousands

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:30.150
place.

00:01:30.150 --> 00:01:36.190
It literally represents 70,000,
7 ten thousands, or 70,000,

00:01:36.190 --> 00:01:41.100
while this represents 700
thousands, or 700,000.

00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:48.520
So the second 7 is 1/10
the value of the first 7.

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:50.790
Or another way of thinking,
it's 10 times less.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:54.460
This is 70,000, and
this is 700,000.

00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:59.190
So the value of the
second 7 is 10 times less

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:02.190
than the value of the first 7.

00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:03.210
Let's do one more.

00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:04.430
This is fun.

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.610
Fill in the following
blanks to complete

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:12.310
the relationships
between 25,430 and 2,543.

00:02:12.310 --> 00:02:22.380
All right, so 25,430 is 10
times larger than 2,543.

00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:24.640
Literally, you take this,
you multiply it by 10,

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.540
you're going to get 25,430.

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.210
The digits in
25,430 are one place

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:38.140
to the blank of the digits
in the number 2,543.

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:39.300
Well, let's think about it.

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:41.450
Here you have a 2 in
the thousands place.

00:02:41.450 --> 00:02:44.490
Here you have a 2 in
the ten thousands place.

00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:47.250
Here you have a 5 in
the hundreds place.

00:02:47.250 --> 00:02:49.420
Here you have a 5 in
the thousands place.

00:02:49.420 --> 00:02:50.650
And we could keep going.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:54.370
But what we see is a
corresponding digit.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:59.290
In 25,430, they're one place
to the left of the digits

00:02:59.290 --> 00:03:00.950
right over here.

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.545
Now, finally, we're
going to take 25,430

00:03:03.545 --> 00:03:07.260
and divide it by 2,543.

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:10.740
Well, we already know that the
first number is 10 times larger

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.960
than this number
right over here.

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:18.100
So literally, if you divide the
smaller number into the larger

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:20.330
one, you're going to get 10.

00:03:20.330 --> 00:03:22.860
This right over here is
10 times larger than this.

00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:27.620
So that was the first part of
the question, and we are done.
