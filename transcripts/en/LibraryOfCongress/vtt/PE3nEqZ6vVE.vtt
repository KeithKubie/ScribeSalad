00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:03.000
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:19.090 --> 00:00:21.860
&gt;&gt; Nancie Atwell: By now
educators have a lot of research

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:23.160
that shows us the benefits

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.150
of voluminous self-selected
book reading.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:29.050
What we know is that independent
readers score the highest

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:31.590
on standardized tests
of reading ability.

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.890
Kids who read extensively

00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:35.690
for pleasure develop
larger vocabularies,

00:00:35.690 --> 00:00:38.940
they write more effectively,
they spell more accurately,

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:41.380
they perform better
in math and science.

00:00:41.380 --> 00:00:42.680
They demonstrate
greater knowledge

00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:44.550
of history and geography.

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.890
It also turns that children's
pleasure reading is important

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:50.350
not just for educational
attainment

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:52.170
but also for social mobility.

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:55.340
A recent study shows that
a childhood that's rich

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:59.330
with self-selected books can
help even our most challenged

00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.190
kids increase cognitive
development

00:01:02.190 --> 00:01:06.210
and overcome social
inequalities.

00:01:06.210 --> 00:01:10.980
As adults, book readers vote
more often, we volunteer more,

00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.420
we demonstrate greater empathy.

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:16.790
Yale tells us we
even live longer.

00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:20.920
Yet independent book reading
is a low priority activity

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:22.720
in U.S. classrooms.

00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:24.020
Most of the good work

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.490
that people have
described today working

00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:29.520
with children is
happening through tutorials.

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.020
In our classrooms
especially in the U.S.,

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.700
commercial reading programs
have a stranglehold.

00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:37.960
At the secondary level kids
are reading whole class novels

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:39.370
or textbooks.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.300
And these activities are
squeezing independent reading

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:44.040
out of the school day.

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:47.880
When kids are allowed to choose
their own books teachers attach

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.370
conditions that strip
meaningful pleasurable reading

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:54.700
of meaning and pleasure.

00:01:54.700 --> 00:02:00.380
Quizzes, book reports, projects,
endless dioramas, collages,

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:02.130
character dress up days,

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:05.550
assignments to write a new
chapter or summarize the book

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.610
in 10 words, or four
emojis, or a meme.

00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:12.430
The Center for Teaching
and Learning is a K

00:02:12.430 --> 00:02:14.500
to 8 demonstration school.

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:19.280
Our role is to innovate and then
to pass along best practices.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.250
Our faculty has learned
to trust in two things --

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:27.190
the power of stories and
the power of kid's humanity.

00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:31.370
Since 1990 we've been working
to demystify the process

00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:34.010
of learning to read
with an approach we call

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.960
reading workshop.

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.170
In reading workshop kids
choose their own books.

00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.080
They read everyday at
school and at home.

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:46.460
And they soar as readers in
terms of accuracy, stamina,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.270
habits, and a love
of literature.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:51.230
The annual average for our 5th

00:02:51.230 --> 00:02:53.960
through 8th graders
is at least 40 books.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:56.860
In the primary grades
where picture books rule,

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:59.310
kids read hundreds
of titles every year.

00:02:59.310 --> 00:03:03.690
Our kids recommend the best
of the best of those stories

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:05.810
on our school website.

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:07.260
Lots and lots of teachers,

00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.350
three or four thousand visits
a week look at that website

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:15.690
to find out what to do to enrich
their classroom libraries.

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:18.730
The reading workshop
teachers at our school invite

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:20.570
and sustain book reading

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:23.710
by making book reading
the central activity

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:25.470
of the reading curriculum.

00:03:25.470 --> 00:03:28.670
Supported by appropriate
research based instruction.

00:03:28.670 --> 00:03:31.930
That means there's time everyday
in school for kids to curl

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.890
up with great stories they
chose and to confer quietly

00:03:35.890 --> 00:03:39.370
with their teachers about
what and how they're reading.

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:43.360
The teachers curate big
updated classroom libraries

00:03:43.360 --> 00:03:45.100
of compelling books.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:49.010
They and their students
recommend titles to one another

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:50.820
in book talks to the class

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:54.390
and they establish special
bookshelves in their classrooms

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.520
where kids can display
their favorite titles.

00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:00.330
Teachers give kids ways to keep
track of the books they've read

00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:03.210
but also the books they
might want to read some day.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:06.690
And they conduct brief pertinent
lessons to the whole group

00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:09.270
about authors and
illustrators, about genres,

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:11.880
about literary elements,
about the strategies

00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.490
that good readers use.

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:18.690
Our school provides colorful
handmade book bags to every kid

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.570
so they can more easily
fulfill our baseline K

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:25.300
to 8 homework assignment and
that's to read or to be read

00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.780
to for at least a half
an hour every night.

00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:31.230
We send home a newsletter to
parents about how they can help

00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:33.490
and each June we
send our kids home

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:36.200
with supermarket
carrier bags stuffed

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.920
with books they've borrowed
because we know that many

00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:42.580
of our kids live in
virtual book deserts.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:45.840
Because of the phenomenon,
also known as summer slide,

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.860
when kids who don't read
in the summer lose as much

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:52.830
as three months of
measured reading ability.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:57.000
Again, our job at CTL is to
teach children and teachers.

00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.460
The faculty writes books.

00:04:59.460 --> 00:05:02.570
Scholastic has generously
given a free copy

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:03.870
to all of you here today.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.220
It's in the materials room.

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:08.290
This is our latest,
"The Reading Zone".

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:10.190
It's the place our
kids say they go

00:05:10.190 --> 00:05:13.010
when they're lost
in a good book.

00:05:13.010 --> 00:05:15.090
We invite other teachers
into our classrooms.

00:05:15.090 --> 00:05:17.280
We give speeches
and presentations.

00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:22.470
All of this to promote the power
of authentic reading in school.

00:05:22.470 --> 00:05:25.590
Book reading -- book
reading makes readers.

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.780
Literacy blooms in
a reading workshop

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:31.400
because kids have easy access
to books they want to read,

00:05:31.400 --> 00:05:34.150
time to get lost in them,
and also opportunities

00:05:34.150 --> 00:05:38.460
to discover what reading
is good for here and now

00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:41.090
and in their literate
lives to come.

00:05:41.090 --> 00:05:45.170
CTL is grateful to the Library
of Congress and David Rubenstein

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:46.530
for this acknowledgement.

00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:48.060
In anticipation of the award,

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:50.760
I know my colleagues
are busily thinking

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:54.910
which books they want order next
for their classroom libraries.

00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:58.090
Classroom libraries
bring the world

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:00.550
to our rural Maine students.

00:06:00.550 --> 00:06:03.100
They make them smart
about everything.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:06.700
When they grow up and
leave Maine, they recognize

00:06:06.700 --> 00:06:10.220
and embrace the wide world
they encounter out there

00:06:10.220 --> 00:06:12.420
because they all
ready know the world.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:15.850
It's already lodged in the
chambers of their imagination

00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:17.970
because of all of
those thousands

00:06:17.970 --> 00:06:21.200
of lines of black print.

00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:23.280
Thank you.

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:25.540
[ Applause ]

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:29.420
&gt;&gt; This has been a presentation
of the Library of Congress.
