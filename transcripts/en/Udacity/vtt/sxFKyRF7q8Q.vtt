00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
We have 2 ways of finding this out.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We can either run the whole thing with this input

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
or we can also go through it and figure out what's going on.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
The interesting thing about this input

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
is that it mixes double quotes and single quotes.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I am going to use the green color

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
for section where tag mode on,

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and I'm going to use the pink color

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
for sections where quote is on.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
So initially, we are in tag mode.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
It starts precisely here, and it goes up to the place where we find the quote.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
While we are processing the quote, quote mode is also turned on.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
But now we see the second quote in here, and quote mode ends.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We are still in tag mode.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Now we see another quote, you see where the problem is.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We don't discriminate between double and single quotes,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and therefore, a string that starts with a

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
double quote can also end in a single quote.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
See, here again we are in tag mode,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.000
but now we also start quote mode.

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.000
And now as we are at the greater than sign that is the end of the tag,

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.000
we are still in quote mode,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000
and therefore, tag mode does not end.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
And sense we stay in quote mode until the very end,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
all of this is considered to be part of the tag,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000
and therefore, the answer is the result is the empty string.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.000
This is the correct result.
