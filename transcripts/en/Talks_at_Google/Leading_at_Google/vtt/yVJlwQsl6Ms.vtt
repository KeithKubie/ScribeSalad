&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: So today we have a special
guest.

00:00:03.249 --> 00:00:08.410
He is a successful entrepreneur, a family
man, and a graduate of the Stanford School

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.410
of Business.

00:00:09.410 --> 00:00:14.790
He has counseled companies such as Dell, Apple,
and Microsoft and is currently on the board

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:19.560
of directors for Kayak.com and also the awesome
Habitat for Humanity.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.990
In his current position he's raised over 400
million in private funding.

00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:28.560
But at the end of the day still has time for
himself, friends, and family and to make a

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:30.410
fresh margarita when he gets home.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.230
Please welcome Brian Sharples of HomeAway.

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:34.360
[applause]

00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:35.489
[cheers]

00:00:35.489 --> 00:00:37.750
&gt;&gt;Brian: Hi.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:42.269
Thanks for having me.

00:00:42.269 --> 00:00:43.269
Really cool space.

00:00:43.269 --> 00:00:44.789
I can't wait to tour it.

00:00:44.789 --> 00:00:45.789
Very jealous.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:46.789
But it's great to be here.

00:00:46.789 --> 00:00:49.350
Google is actually a major partner of ours.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.269
Susan Wojcicki is on our board of directors,
now.

00:00:52.269 --> 00:00:56.329
And Google Ventures is an investor in our
company.

00:00:56.329 --> 00:00:58.920
And so I know a fair amount about Google.

00:00:58.920 --> 00:00:59.940
We've worked with them a lot.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.289
You guys work for an amazing company.

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:06.090
It's obviously the most entrepreneurial big
company in the world and certainly the most

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:08.060
successful tech company of all time.

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.280
Facebook might argue that.

00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.390
But I still give it to Google.

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:12.390
For sure.

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:15.260
And so I'm not really sure what I can tell
you that Google doesn't teach you.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.880
'Cause you guys are in such a great environment.

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:19.880
But I'll try.

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:21.670
I really appreciate being here.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:23.350
I've been an entrepreneur most of my life.

00:01:23.350 --> 00:01:28.720
And so I'm gonna talk very quickly about some
lessons learned along the way.

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:33.159
I'm told that you guys have a long weekend
and so many of you wanna scoot out of here

00:01:33.159 --> 00:01:34.320
as quick as you can.

00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:36.490
So I'll be relatively brief.

00:01:36.490 --> 00:01:40.810
And you know, for those of you who wanna hang
around and ask questions, I'll certainly stay

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:41.810
as long as need be.

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.649
But we're gonna start by rolling a little
piece of old video.

00:01:44.649 --> 00:01:45.649

00:01:45.649 --> 00:01:53.570
&gt;&gt;Male announcer: First in the Bay Area.

00:01:53.570 --> 00:02:01.590
This is The 10' O'clock News on Channel 2.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:02.590
The number one prime time newscast in the
country

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:04.110
&gt;&gt;Elaine Corral: If you're thinking about
buying a car, but can't afford a new one,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.939
this might be your lucky weekend.

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.270
Final preparations are underway at San Francisco
Candlestick Park tonight for the grand opening

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:13.360
of what's called the International Used Auto
Expo.

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:17.420
&gt;&gt;Male Reporter #1: It's playing host to what's
being billed as the world's largest used car

00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:18.420
sale.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:25.880
&gt;&gt;Male Reporter #2: it's being transformed
into the world's largest used car showroom.

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:48.790
&gt;&gt;Male Salesman: We got deals.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:03:02.540
We got everything.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:20.870
We got foreign cars.

00:03:20.870 --> 00:03:39.210
We got domestic cars.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:57.540
We got it all.

00:03:57.540 --> 00:04:06.700
Great prices.

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:39.780
I'm Crazy Brian and I'm doin' this for a living.

&gt;&gt;Male on phone: I think it's happening.

00:04:51.220 --> 00:04:57.310
&gt;&gt;Male Reporter #3: Meteorologists are at
a loss to explain what is causing this weather.

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:59.790
&gt;&gt;Male Reporter #4: A twister in Los Angeles.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.430

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:05.700
&gt;&gt;Male Salesman: People selling cars.

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.220
People are buying cars.

00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.350
People seem happy.

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.870
It's a sunny day.

00:05:09.870 --> 00:05:13.520
The wind has stayed under 30 mile per hour
today.

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520
It's a lovely wind, I mean it actually feels
good.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:15.520
&gt;&gt;Reporter: [inaudible]

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520
&gt;&gt;Male Salesman: Things are much better.

00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:17.520
No tents fell down.

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:18.520
Nobody's been killed.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:19.520
We haven't had a major fire.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:20.520
&gt;&gt;Female Reporter: [inaudible]

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.520
&gt;&gt;Male Salesman: The earth has not shaken
once.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:22.520
So there are lots of things happening.

00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.520
&gt;&gt;Reporter: [inaudible]

00:05:23.520 --> 00:05:24.520
[rock music]

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.520
&gt;&gt;Brian: Year ago.

00:05:25.520 --> 00:05:26.520
That's when most of you were, I don't know,
in kindergarten or something.

00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:27.520
That's how I am.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.520
But.

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:29.520
That was the first, I had done some other
business.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.520
Stupid business stuff before.

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:31.520
But that was the first time I'd ever taken,
ventured, a million dollars.

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.520
That I lost in a matter of three hours.

00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:33.520
It was a big idea.

00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520
Like HomeAway.

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:35.520
But the used car market was all screwed up.

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520
I was buyin' a car at the time.

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520
And had to drive all over San Francisco.

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:38.520
I was like "God, it's such a pain in the ass.

00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520
These people.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.520
Everybody's sellin', everybody's buyin'.

00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:41.520
Just get 'em together all at one place.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:42.520
And we'll do it all over the country.

00:05:42.520 --> 00:05:43.520
Multiple times a year.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:44.520
So people don't have to go through this."

00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:45.520
Right?

00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:46.520
And built this huge thing.

00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.520
And brought in, built the world's biggest
car store on site.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:48.520
Mile long test track.

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:49.520
All this kinda stuff.

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:50.520
So we had like 20 bands playing for this thing.

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520
And it actually, all on Day 1 after about
three hours of opening, a freak storm came

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:52.520
in with about 75 mile an hour winds and just
completely leveled the place.

00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:53.520
We had a--, I remember we had this big finance
operation we built.

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:54.520
'Cause we were actually making a lot of our
money financing cars in this particular deal.

00:05:54.520 --> 00:05:55.520
And we had this giant tent that was about
50 computers at the time it was just like.

00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.520
Big fat IBM PCs and all that.

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520
Just all that completely destroyed in San
Francisco Bay.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520
And there I was with my first deal.

00:05:58.520 --> 00:05:59.520
I knew I had lost everything at the end of
that.

00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:00.520
But the next day we actually put a team of
about 500 people, including I think we grabbed

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:03.060
like the University of San Francisco football
team and worked all night trying to put it

00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:04.060
back together.

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:09.050
But by the second day it was pretty clear
we weren't going to recoup the money.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:11.630
So that was my sorta first deal.

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:13.780
And here I am now, 20 something years later.

00:06:13.780 --> 00:06:19.139
And I'm fortunate enough to have a really
nice success under my belt with HomeAway.

00:06:19.139 --> 00:06:23.639
Which isn't really the success of Google but
it's been a really great ride.

00:06:23.639 --> 00:06:30.410
And the thing I wanna talk about I guess the
most is, how that experience really led to

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.410
HomeAway being successful today.

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:37.850
I was being interviewed yesterday at my home
by Entrepreneur Magazine.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.120
And they asked me this question.

00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.480
Which was, you know "If you had to do it all
again, based on what you know now, what would

00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:46.480
you do differently?"

00:06:46.480 --> 00:06:49.640
And my response to them was "I wouldn't do
anything differently.

00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:50.770
I love everything that happened."

00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:56.440
'Cause the reality is that failing is, in
my opinion, and the thing I've learned, is

00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:58.600
probably the biggest key to success.

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:03.440
I love people who have tried big things and
failed.

00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:07.830
And, you guys, live in a company environment
where you're allowed to take pretty big risks.

00:07:07.830 --> 00:07:09.650
And I know Google is OK with failure.

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:12.310
And that's a really, really important thing.

00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.990
And so as I've, if you wanna click the slide.

00:07:14.990 --> 00:07:18.350
I think the first, when you're a young entrepreneur.

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:21.630
And nobody's probably looking at Google well,
how many people really don't wanna work here

00:07:21.630 --> 00:07:24.290
but wanna start your own company some day.

00:07:24.290 --> 00:07:25.290
Yeah.

00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:26.290
See.

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:27.290
Everybody does.

00:07:27.290 --> 00:07:28.290
Right?

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:29.290
So you probably already have an idea.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:30.290
And there are lots of great ideas out there.

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.790
I get ideas all the time.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:37.650
But the thing that I think I learned very
early on from that venture is that the, ideas

00:07:37.650 --> 00:07:38.650
are important.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.680
And you need to have good ideas.

00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:42.260
But execution is way more important.

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.730
Clicking to the next slide.

00:07:43.730 --> 00:07:44.830
Than ideas.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:47.470
That execution is everything in business.

00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:54.250
And most of what I've learned through the
failures I've had are to focus very very heavily

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.250
on execution.

00:07:55.250 --> 00:07:57.330
And if you click to the next slide.

00:07:57.330 --> 00:08:02.410
Execution, I think, has a lot to do with not
just kind of optimism.

00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:08.199
And being all entrepreneurs wanna think that
they're business is gonna be a huge success.

00:08:08.199 --> 00:08:09.199
You've got an idea.

00:08:09.199 --> 00:08:10.199
It's gonna be great.

00:08:10.199 --> 00:08:12.479
They're always forward thinking, forward leaning.

00:08:12.479 --> 00:08:13.479
And I'm like that too.

00:08:13.479 --> 00:08:15.479
I'm like the eternal optimist.

00:08:15.479 --> 00:08:18.990
But at that age, all I could think about was
what would go right.

00:08:18.990 --> 00:08:21.760
And everybody who comes to you with a business
plan, that's all they ever talk about.

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:22.990
Is what's gonna go right.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:25.520
And the projections are always super rosy.

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:30.800
But over the years when you sort of mature
at doing this stuff and fail a few times,

00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:35.070
you learn that probably the most important
thing to focus on is not what's gonna go right.

00:08:35.070 --> 00:08:37.259
But what could go wrong.

00:08:37.259 --> 00:08:40.319
And you know, it's like being a little kid.

00:08:40.319 --> 00:08:43.530
You touch the fire on the stove and you're
never gonna do it again.

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:48.069
When negative things happen, it causes this
reaction in you where you're just gonna work

00:08:48.069 --> 00:08:50.589
so hard in your life to make sure it never
happens again.

00:08:50.589 --> 00:08:53.170
Which is why I love, again, when I hire people
I always ask them.

00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:54.980
"Tell me about something you failed at.

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.259
And what did you learn from that?" and people
who haven't had those failures don't have

00:08:59.259 --> 00:09:02.950
those muscles that they flex to be cautious
about things.

00:09:02.950 --> 00:09:07.880
So HomeAway was a company that we knew there
was a big opportunity.

00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:09.529
Here's this vacation rental market.

00:09:09.529 --> 00:09:10.529
Nobody touched it.

00:09:10.529 --> 00:09:12.119
It's a worldwide market.

00:09:12.119 --> 00:09:13.779
It's out there for the picking.

00:09:13.779 --> 00:09:19.009
The companies that were in that business were
all relatively small and underfunded.

00:09:19.009 --> 00:09:22.920
But at the same time even though we couldn't
find a big competitor, when we started building

00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:24.399
the company, we said "Look.

00:09:24.399 --> 00:09:25.399
OK.

00:09:25.399 --> 00:09:26.399
We know we can do this.

00:09:26.399 --> 00:09:27.949
We know we can do a better job.

00:09:27.949 --> 00:09:31.089
But let's really think through all the things
that can go wrong here."

00:09:31.089 --> 00:09:34.600
And one of the biggest things that entrepreneurs
don't think through is, they'll look out in

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600
the marketplace and say "Ah.

00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:36.600
I've got this great idea.

00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:38.029
And nobody else has this product.

00:09:38.029 --> 00:09:39.029
See?

00:09:39.029 --> 00:09:40.029
It's fantastic.

00:09:40.029 --> 00:09:41.029
Nobody else has this.

00:09:41.029 --> 00:09:42.029
Nobody's doing this."

00:09:42.029 --> 00:09:43.029
Well, that's an irrelevant question.

00:09:43.029 --> 00:09:48.100
The question is, if you're successful doing
it, who's gonna now come in and do it.

00:09:48.100 --> 00:09:49.100
Right?

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:53.579
I mean, and most people don't think that way
but you have to role play and scenario plan

00:09:53.579 --> 00:09:54.839
for those kinds of things.

00:09:54.839 --> 00:09:59.350
And so in the case of HomeAway for example,
we knew, and of course the world is really

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:00.350
changed now.

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:05.690
You come up with a hot idea and there are
people cloning it left and right as fast as

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:06.690
possible.

00:10:06.690 --> 00:10:10.180
And so one of the things you have to do in
today's environment, is if you've got a great

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.360
idea, part of being paranoid is, a.

00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:14.360
staying somewhat quiet.

00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.760
A lot of people like to talk about what they're
doing.

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.760
A little too early.

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:22.689
With HomeAway, even though we were really
successful from the first days, we didn't

00:10:22.689 --> 00:10:25.279
really say much about the business for the
first three or four years.

00:10:25.279 --> 00:10:29.449
And our investors would say "Why aren't you
out there in the press doing this and that?"

00:10:29.449 --> 00:10:30.899
And we're like, "Well, because we're not in
Germany yet.

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.199
We're not in France yet.

00:10:32.199 --> 00:10:33.199
We.

00:10:33.199 --> 00:10:34.199
Shhh.

00:10:34.199 --> 00:10:35.199
This is a really good business.

00:10:35.199 --> 00:10:36.199
We don't wanna tell anybody about it."

00:10:36.199 --> 00:10:37.639
And that was sort of part of our paranoia.

00:10:37.639 --> 00:10:42.510
Part of our paranoia was we knew that we were
in a marketplace business.

00:10:42.510 --> 00:10:44.730
Much like Google is.

00:10:44.730 --> 00:10:49.339
If you're searching for stuff, you're gonna
go the place where the most relevant results

00:10:49.339 --> 00:10:50.339
are.

00:10:50.339 --> 00:10:52.980
And where there's relevant results you're
gonna be served by having the most people

00:10:52.980 --> 00:10:55.559
using that service and making them better.

00:10:55.559 --> 00:10:56.790
And so HomeAway is the same thing.

00:10:56.790 --> 00:11:01.540
We knew that controlling supply, controlling
demand, being the biggest in our business

00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:04.259
was gonna be our key core competitive advantage.

00:11:04.259 --> 00:11:07.809
So we had to get as big as we could as fast
as we could.

00:11:07.809 --> 00:11:11.779
You know, conventional wisdom when you're
an entrepreneur starting out is "I wanna retain

00:11:11.779 --> 00:11:13.980
as much of the company as I can for myself.

00:11:13.980 --> 00:11:16.420
I don't wanna bring in too many investors.

00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:17.420
Or sell stock."

00:11:17.420 --> 00:11:20.339
Well this was one where I said, you know what
it's either gonna work or it's not.

00:11:20.339 --> 00:11:21.339
And if it's gonna work.

00:11:21.339 --> 00:11:24.120
And we have to assume that Expedia is gonna
come into the business.

00:11:24.120 --> 00:11:26.480
There was a time when we thought Google was
gonna come into the business.

00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:29.940
I don't believe that anymore for a number
of reasons.

00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.639
You know, Trip Advisor was gonna come to the
business.

00:11:32.639 --> 00:11:34.930
So let's just assume that's gonna happen.

00:11:34.930 --> 00:11:35.930
And run really fast.

00:11:35.930 --> 00:11:38.620
And run really fast for us meant, we don't
even have time to build it.

00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:41.269
We'll build it and we'll build a platform
called HomeAway.

00:11:41.269 --> 00:11:43.220
But there's already a leader in Germany, let's
go buy 'em.

00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:45.179
. There's already a leader in France, let's
go buy 'em.

00:11:45.179 --> 00:11:46.320
. So we ran around the world.

00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:49.690
The day we opened the company, we bought five
companies in the first day.

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:55.490
But that takes a ton of money, which takes
away from equity for me and everybody else

00:11:55.490 --> 00:11:56.779
who was starting the company.

00:11:56.779 --> 00:12:00.050
But that was irrelevant to us because again,
it was about managing risk.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:03.110
I will give up equity, to manage that risk.

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:04.600
Somebody said we raised 400 million.

00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:12.600
I mean, when we did our, I guess it was our
third venture round in 2008, 250 million.

00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.519
I mean it was the biggest venture round for
a tech company in nine years.

00:12:17.519 --> 00:12:18.989
And we gave up, well, how could we do it?

00:12:18.989 --> 00:12:24.550
But we did it because again, we were sort
of paranoid about making sure we were the

00:12:24.550 --> 00:12:25.550
biggest.

00:12:25.550 --> 00:12:27.300
You know, we were gonna get there first.

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:33.389
I think the other thing that we did in a very
disciplined way as a team was also that very

00:12:33.389 --> 00:12:36.350
paranoid, just managing our money and managing
our costs.

00:12:36.350 --> 00:12:38.060
'Cause that's the other thing that gets a
lot of people in trouble.

00:12:38.060 --> 00:12:41.610
I look at this auto expo business that I was
putting together.

00:12:41.610 --> 00:12:42.671
There was a ton of risks in that.

00:12:42.671 --> 00:12:46.660
That I didn't really fully appreciate and
understand.

00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:47.670
One of them was obviously the weather.

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:49.509
I should have gone out and bought insurance
for the weather.

00:12:49.509 --> 00:12:52.950
Now I had done a little bit of research, and
the wind had actually never gotten over 70

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:53.980
miles an hour.

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:55.329
On that day in San Francisco.

00:12:55.329 --> 00:12:56.749
But sure enough it did.

00:12:56.749 --> 00:12:59.399
I probably could have done some things to
protect myself.

00:12:59.399 --> 00:13:01.759
So if you go to the next slide.

00:13:01.759 --> 00:13:07.239
I think probably the biggest word that comes
to mind in terms of my learnings about how

00:13:07.239 --> 00:13:10.920
to manage risk is curiosity.

00:13:10.920 --> 00:13:15.450
Is that you, again, it's such a, people have
such a tendency to focus on all the things

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:16.450
that go right.

00:13:16.450 --> 00:13:18.040
But you have to be really curious about the
things that can go wrong.

00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:25.739
And I love when entrepreneurs come to me with
business plans and they're curious, even,

00:13:25.739 --> 00:13:27.600
about all the things that can go wrong.

00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:32.139
I hate seeing somebody who's just all about
the positive.

00:13:32.139 --> 00:13:33.139
All about the positive.

00:13:33.139 --> 00:13:36.470
You have to be intellectually honest that
you don't know everything.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:38.529
So curiosity means doing your research.

00:13:38.529 --> 00:13:40.670
In fact, I remember with HomeAway in the beginning.

00:13:40.670 --> 00:13:45.440
Carl and I founded the business, we had a
very different about how HomeAway would work.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:47.139
And I don't know how much you guys know our
business.

00:13:47.139 --> 00:13:48.360
It's actually a pretty simple business.

00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:50.339
It's like a classified marketplace.

00:13:50.339 --> 00:13:53.170
The biggest site in the world is a company
called VRBO.

00:13:53.170 --> 00:13:55.089
VRBO's a very basic looking site.

00:13:55.089 --> 00:13:58.670
In fact, it's funny, when I first started
getting into business, I remember starting

00:13:58.670 --> 00:13:59.670
to do my research.

00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:04.639
And there was VRBO and I looked at that site
and I said "No. that can't be working.

00:14:04.639 --> 00:14:05.769
That thing's awful."

00:14:05.769 --> 00:14:07.930
And I spent four months going down another
path.

00:14:07.930 --> 00:14:13.360
A path of "Ah, we're gonna build this big
integrated online booking system for the vacation

00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:14.360
rental industry."

00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.920
And then ultimately, we got really curious.

00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:19.230
And we came back to VRBO and said "Wait a
second.

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:20.230
Let's count.

00:14:20.230 --> 00:14:21.279
There's this many listings.

00:14:21.279 --> 00:14:22.410
They're charging this much money.

00:14:22.410 --> 00:14:23.410
Right?

00:14:23.410 --> 00:14:24.509
So that's a pretty good business."

00:14:24.509 --> 00:14:27.249
So let's call up their customers and call
up their owners.

00:14:27.249 --> 00:14:28.970
And our owners loved them.

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:30.879
When we called the travelers, the travelers
loved them.

00:14:30.879 --> 00:14:32.470
I hated the site.

00:14:32.470 --> 00:14:33.470
I've gotta be honest.

00:14:33.470 --> 00:14:34.470
I couldn't use it.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.470
But it didn't matter.

00:14:35.470 --> 00:14:36.470
We did enough research.

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.999
We were curious enough to turn over all the
different rocks.

00:14:38.999 --> 00:14:44.269
And ultimately we picked a model that everyone
even who was backing us said "Really, that's

00:14:44.269 --> 00:14:46.739
kind of a simple, just classified marketplace?"

00:14:46.739 --> 00:14:49.339
Well that was the model that was right in
the industry.

00:14:49.339 --> 00:14:50.839
It didn't necessarily feel right to us.

00:14:50.839 --> 00:14:52.509
But that's what the research told us.

00:14:52.509 --> 00:14:54.800
And that's what our curiosity told us.

00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:57.220
So, being curious is super important.

00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:02.250
And then I think, the last big thing is, it's
hard to be curious if you aren't humble.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.439
Which is the next word I'll put up there too.

00:15:05.439 --> 00:15:13.490
Which is you can't, I think, you know, people
and teams are so important to businesses.

00:15:13.490 --> 00:15:16.470
Probably one of my biggest learnings, I think
the other, if you go back to Auto Expo.

00:15:16.470 --> 00:15:18.579
I was doing it all myself.

00:15:18.579 --> 00:15:24.149
I grabbed a bunch of friends and people I
know to help me put the thing together.

00:15:24.149 --> 00:15:28.899
The operations crew that put the event together
was the, were the guys who produced Grateful

00:15:28.899 --> 00:15:29.899
Dead concerts.

00:15:29.899 --> 00:15:31.109
'Cause I was a deadhead at the time.

00:15:31.109 --> 00:15:33.019
And knew some of these guys.

00:15:33.019 --> 00:15:35.439
You know I was "Come on, just do this thing."

00:15:35.439 --> 00:15:39.889
And you know, as you get older and more seasoned
what you start to realize is, you can't do

00:15:39.889 --> 00:15:40.889
everything.

00:15:40.889 --> 00:15:41.889
You don't have every skill.

00:15:41.889 --> 00:15:45.489
I've got, on a spectrum of 10 things that
you need to do well to run a good business,

00:15:45.489 --> 00:15:49.850
I maybe have one or two of those 10 things.

00:15:49.850 --> 00:15:51.940
And so you learn to be humble about that.

00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.009
Appreciate the things you're good at.

00:15:53.009 --> 00:15:54.769
Appreciate the things you're not good at.

00:15:54.769 --> 00:15:55.769
If you're gonna start a business.

00:15:55.769 --> 00:15:57.149
Starting business is about a team.

00:15:57.149 --> 00:15:59.929
And a team really isn't necessarily about
friendship.

00:15:59.929 --> 00:16:02.430
A team should be about complimentary skills.

00:16:02.430 --> 00:16:07.069
And about bringing on people who can help
mitigate the risk that you're not good at.

00:16:07.069 --> 00:16:08.239
I hate legal stuff.

00:16:08.239 --> 00:16:09.689
Because it's minutia for me.

00:16:09.689 --> 00:16:12.009
I can't deal with that sorta stuff.

00:16:12.009 --> 00:16:14.519
I hate the details of accounting.

00:16:14.519 --> 00:16:16.089
And I'm not very good at offsets.

00:16:16.089 --> 00:16:17.110
I'm not a programmer.

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:18.119
I'm not a developer.

00:16:18.119 --> 00:16:19.160
I can't do those things.

00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:24.490
And so again, with HomeAway, after all those
kinda years of doing things.

00:16:24.490 --> 00:16:25.490
Some worked.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:26.490
A little bit.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:29.410
Some, this is actually my second public company.

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:30.899
Some failed.

00:16:30.899 --> 00:16:33.300
You really start to think hard about building
that team.

00:16:33.300 --> 00:16:37.299
And I think the other right thing we did with
HomeAway is we brought in extraordinary people.

00:16:37.299 --> 00:16:42.250
It's really the thing I admire the most about,
I was at Google Zeitgeist earlier this year.

00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:50.369
And I got to meet Sergey and his focus on
people and how you guys hire, and just how

00:16:50.369 --> 00:16:51.369
important that is, is dead on.

00:16:51.369 --> 00:16:52.699
Congratulations that you all made the filter.

00:16:52.699 --> 00:16:53.920
I don't think I would.

00:16:53.920 --> 00:16:54.920
Oh, ha-ha-ha, Justin did.

00:16:54.920 --> 00:16:56.560
He used to work for us.

00:16:56.560 --> 00:16:57.790
But somehow he got.

00:16:57.790 --> 00:16:58.790
[laughter]

00:16:58.790 --> 00:17:01.860
Somehow he's, he, slipped the rope.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:02.860
[laughter]

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:08.449
But the whole, [laughs] but the whole people
aspect seriously is very important and I think

00:17:08.449 --> 00:17:14.270
if you're ever going to go out and raise money
and try to start a business, I guarantee you

00:17:14.270 --> 00:17:17.510
that you will do better if you're humble than
if you're cocky.

00:17:17.510 --> 00:17:24.500
Even when we were doing that 250 million dollar
round, and we closed it actually on the lowest

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.500
day in the market.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:26.819
In the last nine years.

00:17:26.819 --> 00:17:33.659
It was right in the financial crisis and it
was when everything literally burst.

00:17:33.659 --> 00:17:37.620
And we ended up closing that deal at a very
high price.

00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:40.770
The price that we had negotiated six months
prior.

00:17:40.770 --> 00:17:42.121
I held my ground on it.

00:17:42.121 --> 00:17:45.612
And I remember after that decision was made
and it got funded.

00:17:45.612 --> 00:17:49.940
And there was one very big, TCV put in 175
million of that money.

00:17:49.940 --> 00:17:53.580
And we all went to a bar afterwards to have
a beer.

00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:59.090
And I, now that the thing was closed, I said,
I was talking to the partners and I said "Man,

00:17:59.090 --> 00:18:03.540
why didn't you guys just really put the screws
down?

00:18:03.540 --> 00:18:07.080
And tell us that we gotta do it at half the
price or whatever?"

00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:08.080
He said "You know."

00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:12.370
He said "Brian, I gotta tell you, you're the
first guy who's come into this office in 10

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:16.289
years who we've asked, how good is your product
on a scale of one to 10?"

00:18:16.289 --> 00:18:18.730
And you said "I think it's a three."

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:20.840
And he said "We've just never heard that before.

00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.070
We loved it."

00:18:22.070 --> 00:18:23.760
People love to hear that stuff.

00:18:23.760 --> 00:18:25.169
That you're humble about it.

00:18:25.169 --> 00:18:26.500
You can get better.

00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:28.350
So word of advice.

00:18:28.350 --> 00:18:33.880
I'd be certainly more inclined to invest if
you do that.

00:18:33.880 --> 00:18:35.890
And then I really already talked about this.

00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:37.000
The people and the partners.

00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:38.690
And the importance of all that.

00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:45.639
And just again, I think HomeAway's been a
dream deal for me because I get to work with

00:18:45.639 --> 00:18:47.179
board members I chose.

00:18:47.179 --> 00:18:48.179
And the management team I chose.

00:18:48.179 --> 00:18:49.789
And lots of people I chose.

00:18:49.789 --> 00:18:53.929
You know Tiff right here is now a very senior
person in our market organization.

00:18:53.929 --> 00:18:55.539
Used to be the nanny for my kids.

00:18:55.539 --> 00:18:56.539
10 years ago.

00:18:56.539 --> 00:18:57.539
[laughter]

00:18:57.539 --> 00:19:02.399
I mean, it's a real, you know, you get, surround
yourself with really terrific people and terrific

00:19:02.399 --> 00:19:03.399
things are gonna happen.

00:19:03.399 --> 00:19:09.390
So that's really just sort of the formal talk
and I'd be happy to, it wasn't that formal,

00:19:09.390 --> 00:19:12.670
to take any questions you guys might have.

00:19:12.670 --> 00:19:13.670
Right.

00:19:13.670 --> 00:19:16.770
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [inaudible] We'll take
some from the Dory.

00:19:16.770 --> 00:19:18.440
So I have one from Jeremy.

00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.970
How did you and other founders accelerate
the growth and profitability of HomeAway?

00:19:22.970 --> 00:19:27.620
Was it by transforming the "how" of what you
did, and not just "what"?

00:19:27.620 --> 00:19:32.620
&gt;&gt;Brian: You know, our company is going through
phases.

00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:34.600
And it's still very much an unwritten book.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:40.309
And when people try to pat us on the back
for the success of the company, I don't really

00:19:40.309 --> 00:19:41.730
like to claim victory yet.

00:19:41.730 --> 00:19:45.730
'Cause I think we're in pretty early stages
with the business.

00:19:45.730 --> 00:19:50.160
Early on, we, I think what we did is we recognized
that there was a good market out there.

00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:51.160
And we consolidated it.

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.940
And we did it a lot by acquisition.

00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:59.380
And we built a technology platform that would
allow us to integrate those acquisitions together.

00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:00.809
But that was so much work.

00:20:00.809 --> 00:20:01.809
To just do that.

00:20:01.809 --> 00:20:06.690
Just to set up an international business that
quickly and run around the world doing it.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:12.019
That we frankly haven't had historically a
lot of time to focus on the how to make it

00:20:12.019 --> 00:20:13.019
better.

00:20:13.019 --> 00:20:14.250
That's where we are now.

00:20:14.250 --> 00:20:18.690
So we've gotten ourselves in a market position
where we're clearly the leader in the business.

00:20:18.690 --> 00:20:23.230
And I'm still of the same opinion when people
say what's the quality of your product or

00:20:23.230 --> 00:20:24.230
your experience?

00:20:24.230 --> 00:20:25.230
On a scale of one to 10.

00:20:25.230 --> 00:20:28.060
Well, it was probably three a couple years
ago when we were raising that money.

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.059
I think we're up to a five or a six.

00:20:30.059 --> 00:20:34.250
But we're, you know, but you should be for
a business like us, market leader, you should

00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:35.250
be a nine.

00:20:35.250 --> 00:20:36.250
Somewhere in that range.

00:20:36.250 --> 00:20:38.409
So that's really something we're just going
to work on now.

00:20:38.409 --> 00:20:41.570
How to make the experience as good as it can
be.

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:43.039
We've set a pretty high bar for that.

00:20:43.039 --> 00:20:48.260
Which is that it should be as easy to find,
compare, and book a vacation rental as it

00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.279
is to get a hotel room.

00:20:49.279 --> 00:20:51.000
And you know how it is to get a hotel room,
right?

00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:53.799
You just dial up Expedia, every hotel in the
world is on there.

00:20:53.799 --> 00:20:54.799
This one's available, this one's open.

00:20:54.799 --> 00:20:55.799
Boom.

00:20:55.799 --> 00:20:56.950
Put it on my credit card and I'm done.

00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:59.720
You cannot do that in our business today.

00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:03.009
And that is the direction we're moving in,
and we're pretty excited about it.

00:21:03.009 --> 00:21:05.289
But it's gonna take us probably three to five
years to get there.

00:21:05.289 --> 00:21:06.309
From now.

00:21:06.309 --> 00:21:09.340
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: I have another question.

00:21:09.340 --> 00:21:12.639
A little, it's, I've seen 89 Dead shows.

00:21:12.639 --> 00:21:14.019
How many have you seen?

00:21:14.019 --> 00:21:15.019
[laughter]

00:21:15.019 --> 00:21:16.019
Where was your first show?

00:21:16.019 --> 00:21:17.019
&gt;&gt;Brian: Wow.

00:21:17.019 --> 00:21:20.019
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: And it also says, my first
show was November 4th, 1985 in the Centrum

00:21:20.019 --> 00:21:21.269
in Worcester, Massachusetts.

00:21:21.269 --> 00:21:23.570
&gt;&gt;Brian: That's pretty cool.

00:21:23.570 --> 00:21:25.409
I've probably seen, not that many.

00:21:25.409 --> 00:21:27.870
I don't know, I've probably seen like 17,
18.

00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:28.870
Most of them in California.

00:21:28.870 --> 00:21:30.940
Most in places like the Greek Theater.

00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.070
There actually used to be a really nice outdoor
amphitheater at Stanford which I don't think

00:21:36.070 --> 00:21:38.429
they use anymore.

00:21:38.429 --> 00:21:40.330
I've seen them in Red Rocks.

00:21:40.330 --> 00:21:42.289
I've seen them in Maine.

00:21:42.289 --> 00:21:43.390
All over the place.

00:21:43.390 --> 00:21:45.080
I grew up in New England.

00:21:45.080 --> 00:21:46.080
Went to Stanford.

00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:48.399
So really in those two spots.

00:21:48.399 --> 00:21:49.399
But, 89, that's impressive.

00:21:49.399 --> 00:21:50.399
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [inaudible]

00:21:50.399 --> 00:21:53.350
&gt;&gt;Brian: Ask them back, how old are they and

00:21:53.350 --> 00:21:54.980
[laughter]

00:21:54.980 --> 00:21:55.980
And can they

00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:56.980
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Is Brad in here?

00:21:56.980 --> 00:21:57.980
Brad?

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:59.280
&gt;&gt;Brian: And can they still function intelligently
and walk?

00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:00.280
[laughter]

00:22:00.280 --> 00:22:02.880
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Brad?

00:22:02.880 --> 00:22:03.880
Brad?

00:22:03.880 --> 00:22:05.450
I have another one.

00:22:05.450 --> 00:22:07.549
Will you share with us your fresh margarita
recipe?

00:22:07.549 --> 00:22:09.990
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yes, I would be happy to.

00:22:09.990 --> 00:22:13.310
I have the same thing every single day when
I get home.

00:22:13.310 --> 00:22:15.179
It's actually the joy of my day.

00:22:15.179 --> 00:22:16.179
So.

00:22:16.179 --> 00:22:18.840
If you get a pen for this get it out.

00:22:18.840 --> 00:22:21.990
So you have to first you need Don Julio Silver.

00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.840
So well, highball glass.

00:22:23.840 --> 00:22:25.460
Fill it with ice.

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:27.620
Then Don Julio Silver, one shot.

00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:28.730
Cointreau, one shot.

00:22:28.730 --> 00:22:29.730
No substitute.

00:22:29.730 --> 00:22:33.580
None of this like Patron Orange or Grand Marnier
or anything.

00:22:33.580 --> 00:22:34.799
It has to be Cointreau.

00:22:34.799 --> 00:22:36.200
One shot exactly.

00:22:36.200 --> 00:22:38.740
They you need three key limes.

00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:42.440
You know the difference between key limes
and a regular lime?

00:22:42.440 --> 00:22:43.440
Key limes are the little guys.

00:22:43.440 --> 00:22:44.440
And you have the big ones.

00:22:44.440 --> 00:22:45.440
So you need three key limes.

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:46.440
Cut 'em in half.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:47.440
Squeeze 'em in, totally.

00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:51.130
And take a fourth one, cut that in half and
just drop those little two halves in.

00:22:51.130 --> 00:22:54.750
And then an orange, cut it in half, squeeze
half an orange in.

00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:55.780
Shake it all up.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.230
I'm tellin' ya, you'll have one every day.

00:22:58.230 --> 00:22:59.230
[laughter]

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:09.549
&gt;&gt;female Presenter: Anybody have any questions
in the audience?

00:23:09.549 --> 00:23:10.549
You wanna ask?

00:23:10.549 --> 00:23:11.549
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yes.

00:23:11.549 --> 00:23:12.549
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: [inaudible] over here.

00:23:12.549 --> 00:23:13.549
&gt;&gt;male #1: You read a lot about business ventures
now and a lot of investors like to see customers

00:23:13.549 --> 00:23:14.549
before they invest.

00:23:14.549 --> 00:23:18.700
It sounds like you guys did a lot of your
funding before you actually started the business.

00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:19.700
Or before day one.

00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.550
How did you go about that and what ideas do
you have in that realm?

00:23:23.550 --> 00:23:24.550
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yeah.

00:23:24.550 --> 00:23:30.840
I mean, we, you know, we were sort of fortunate
in that just as individuals starting the business

00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:32.690
we weren't super financially constrained.

00:23:32.690 --> 00:23:34.880
'Cause we'd done some stuff before.

00:23:34.880 --> 00:23:38.470
And I had just sold a public company.

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:39.889
And was taking some time off.

00:23:39.889 --> 00:23:44.159
And then Carl Shepherd who co-founded with
me used to be the CEO of Hoovers and then

00:23:44.159 --> 00:23:48.110
they got sold to DNB and I don't think he
was even planning to go to work again.

00:23:48.110 --> 00:23:50.490
But when we decided to do the business.

00:23:50.490 --> 00:23:54.250
Actually Austin Ventures committed 50 million
to HomeAway.

00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:55.679
No business plan, just one sentence.

00:23:55.679 --> 00:23:59.690
Which is "We're going to build the world's
largest market for vacation rentals."

00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:01.440
And they said "How?"

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:03.840
And we said "We don't know, but we're gonna
go find out."

00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:05.590
But they committed the money beforehand.

00:24:05.590 --> 00:24:11.809
And so we spent, I would say, four to five
months.

00:24:11.809 --> 00:24:15.909
Our initial mission was, "Let's kind of search
the web.

00:24:15.909 --> 00:24:17.070
Search our contacts.

00:24:17.070 --> 00:24:21.730
Find anybody we can who knows anything about
the business.

00:24:21.730 --> 00:24:22.990
Owners.

00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:24.730
Property managers.

00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:27.179
People who tried to get in the business before
and failed."

00:24:27.179 --> 00:24:31.509
So one of the stories that kept coming up
when we were researching this, is that Expedia,

00:24:31.509 --> 00:24:33.100
Expedia had already tried this.

00:24:33.100 --> 00:24:35.039
They had already tried this and they'd completely
failed.

00:24:35.039 --> 00:24:39.700
And it turned out that there was a company
back in 1999 called Vacation Spot.

00:24:39.700 --> 00:24:43.230
It was started by a guy named Steve Murch.

00:24:43.230 --> 00:24:44.929
And Vacation Spot was VRBO.

00:24:44.929 --> 00:24:46.320
It was HomeAway.

00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:48.540
And this was a venture backed business.

00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.840
And these guys got up to, very quickly, about
a million dollars in revenue.

00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840
And Expedia came in.

00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:57.260
The guy who was running Expedia at the time
was a guy named Rich Barton who went on to

00:24:57.260 --> 00:24:59.340
found Zillow and some other things.

00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.950
And Rich bought the company for 75 million
dollars.

00:25:01.950 --> 00:25:04.759
Which back then was a huge deal.

00:25:04.759 --> 00:25:06.309
Was 75 times revenue.

00:25:06.309 --> 00:25:09.500
It was like one of these spectacular bubble
kinda deals.

00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.760
Anyway, a year later, company's completely
out of business.

00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:13.760
Gone.

00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:15.059
And so everybody kept telling this story.

00:25:15.059 --> 00:25:17.059
So I didn't know Barton.

00:25:17.059 --> 00:25:18.129
So through venture capitalists, whatever.

00:25:18.129 --> 00:25:19.379
I said "We gotta go see Barton.

00:25:19.379 --> 00:25:21.450
I gotta figure out what the hell happened."

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:23.300
And so Barton agreed to meet with us.

00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.300
He's in Seattle.

00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:25.300
I flew out to Seattle.

00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:26.300
Sat down with them.

00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:31.259
He was kind enough to actually bring in Murch
and the other guys who had that company.

00:25:31.259 --> 00:25:33.000
And we said "Alright.

00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:36.820
So you guys already tried what we're about
to try.

00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:38.309
What the heck happened to the business?"

00:25:38.309 --> 00:25:42.390
And this was how, when I was talking earlier,
they said "Well, you know, Vacation Spot,

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:43.679
it was a great company.

00:25:43.679 --> 00:25:44.710
It was a subscription business.

00:25:44.710 --> 00:25:47.860
It was a very simple classified market place."

00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:49.799
And Rich says "You know, we bought it.

00:25:49.799 --> 00:25:51.639
And we're Expedia.

00:25:51.639 --> 00:25:53.080
We charge a percentage of revenue.

00:25:53.080 --> 00:25:55.110
So we basically said to all customers.

00:25:55.110 --> 00:25:56.409
'Forget the subscription.

00:25:56.409 --> 00:25:57.409
That's now free.

00:25:57.409 --> 00:25:59.669
You're just gonna pay us 15 percent of bookings.'

00:25:59.669 --> 00:26:00.950
Thing went out of business.

00:26:00.950 --> 00:26:01.970
Everybody left."

00:26:01.970 --> 00:26:04.389
But that was exactly what Carl and I were
gonna do at the time.

00:26:04.389 --> 00:26:07.289
And so it was again, just by networking around.

00:26:07.289 --> 00:26:10.129
We're just gonna go talk to everybody we possibly
can.

00:26:10.129 --> 00:26:15.149
And then during that process of talking to
everybody we ended up meeting the Europeans

00:26:15.149 --> 00:26:17.539
who had the strongest business models.

00:26:17.539 --> 00:26:19.370
People in Brazil who have the strongest business
models.

00:26:19.370 --> 00:26:21.570
And they all had the same thing in common.

00:26:21.570 --> 00:26:22.799
They're all the same.

00:26:22.799 --> 00:26:24.230
There are two things in common.

00:26:24.230 --> 00:26:25.880
They kept them all really simple.

00:26:25.880 --> 00:26:27.460
Classified, subscription based.

00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.840
And they really understood the power of Google.

00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:30.929
Those were the two things.

00:26:30.929 --> 00:26:32.250
They really understood the power of Google.

00:26:32.250 --> 00:26:35.060
So they were all so focused on SEO.

00:26:35.060 --> 00:26:37.250
And so good at SEO.

00:26:37.250 --> 00:26:41.000
We now, over time, have had to really diversify
our sources of traffic.

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:42.770
But that was the winning formula back then.

00:26:42.770 --> 00:26:50.240
And so again I would just say, if you're starting
a company, you can't, people will see you.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.399
Just call people.

00:26:51.399 --> 00:26:53.340
Tell 'em you're doing research.

00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:54.659
Whatever it is.

00:26:54.659 --> 00:26:59.929
And if you can find, like we did, a company
that actually tried it and failed, that's

00:26:59.929 --> 00:27:00.929
like the Holy Grail.

00:27:00.929 --> 00:27:03.850
'Cause then you know, 'cause either you're
gonna figure out it's not doable 'cause they

00:27:03.850 --> 00:27:05.519
really tried everything.

00:27:05.519 --> 00:27:10.070
Or you're gonna figure out like we did, see
they just messed with the formula, and they

00:27:10.070 --> 00:27:11.960
shouldn't have messed with the formula.

00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.149
&gt;&gt;male #2: I just had a quick question.

00:27:14.149 --> 00:27:16.659
It seems like most of your background is in
California.

00:27:16.659 --> 00:27:18.690
And I was wondering how you got to Austin?

00:27:18.690 --> 00:27:22.840
&gt;&gt;Brian: I got to Austin because after business
school I had a ton of debt.

00:27:22.840 --> 00:27:25.919
And I went to work for Bain and Company, which
is a consulting company.

00:27:25.919 --> 00:27:28.870
And I was in their San Francisco office.

00:27:28.870 --> 00:27:32.740
And my, I had two clients in the short time
I was there.

00:27:32.740 --> 00:27:34.919
One was Baxter Travenol in Chicago.

00:27:34.919 --> 00:27:37.210
And the other was Dell Computer, before they
were even public.

00:27:37.210 --> 00:27:41.490
Dell was the smallest company that Bain had
ever taken on.

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:44.059
We actually did an equity for work deal with
them.

00:27:44.059 --> 00:27:47.230
And I was the head of that team.

00:27:47.230 --> 00:27:52.090
So I would, every Sunday night, I would fly
down to Austin, Texas and I would go to the

00:27:52.090 --> 00:27:55.280
arboretum and sit at the Friday's at a particular
spot in the bar.

00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.809
The guy wouldn't even have to say anything.

00:27:56.809 --> 00:27:58.950
He'd give me a beer and a thing of fried clams.

00:27:58.950 --> 00:27:59.950
So gross.

00:27:59.950 --> 00:28:00.950
They don't even have that anymore.

00:28:00.950 --> 00:28:01.950
[laughter] But I'd sit.

00:28:01.950 --> 00:28:03.340
And then I would stay Monday, Tuesday.

00:28:03.340 --> 00:28:04.340
And then fly up to Chicago.

00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:05.340
Then back to Travenol.

00:28:05.340 --> 00:28:07.139
Couple days go back to San Francisco.

00:28:07.139 --> 00:28:10.529
And in the process I got to know a lot of
people from Dell.

00:28:10.529 --> 00:28:12.639
I'd go out on the lake, go water skiing.

00:28:12.639 --> 00:28:13.639
This kinda thing.

00:28:13.639 --> 00:28:15.470
And ultimately I just got sorta hooked on
Austin.

00:28:15.470 --> 00:28:17.549
And came down a few years later.

00:28:17.549 --> 00:28:20.639
So I've been here now more than I've been
anywhere.

00:28:20.639 --> 00:28:22.029
Over 20 years.

00:28:22.029 --> 00:28:25.460
&gt;&gt;male #3: I have an answer to one of your
questions.

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:26.460
And then a quick question.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:29.850
So the answer to your question is, Brad Askins
is the Deadhead.

00:28:29.850 --> 00:28:30.850
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yeah.

00:28:30.850 --> 00:28:32.450
&gt;&gt;male #3: who asked the original question.

00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:34.740
He's on our SketchUp team.

00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:36.170
And he wanted to mention that he was on two
tours.

00:28:36.170 --> 00:28:38.840
And to your question of how he's feeling.

00:28:38.840 --> 00:28:40.409
He said he's still seeing trails.

00:28:40.409 --> 00:28:41.409
[laughter]

00:28:41.409 --> 00:28:42.409
&gt;&gt;Brian: Good.

00:28:42.409 --> 00:28:43.409
Excellent.

00:28:43.409 --> 00:28:47.649
&gt;&gt;male #3: My question is, you mention that
there's probably 10 skills that it takes to

00:28:47.649 --> 00:28:50.250
make a successful business and you hold one
or two of those.

00:28:50.250 --> 00:28:51.250
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yeah.

00:28:51.250 --> 00:28:52.860
&gt;&gt;male #3: What would you say those skills
are for you?

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:57.870
&gt;&gt;Brian: Oh, for me it's, actually I think
there was a word behind this so I didn't click

00:28:57.870 --> 00:28:58.870
one more I'm sorry.

00:28:58.870 --> 00:29:00.620
I put it together like five minutes before
I came here.

00:29:00.620 --> 00:29:01.820
So the next word is "passion."

00:29:01.820 --> 00:29:07.830
One of 'em is, despite the fact that I counsel
people to be humble, you do have to be super

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:08.950
passionate about something.

00:29:08.950 --> 00:29:12.500
So I do get passionate about things that I
wanna do.

00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:13.690
So a, I've got a soul.

00:29:13.690 --> 00:29:18.489
Second is, I think I'm a very good communicator
when I'm passionate.

00:29:18.489 --> 00:29:23.960
Which means that I'm able to get other people
really excited about what I'm excited about.

00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.129
'Cause it does take a village.

00:29:25.129 --> 00:29:30.679
And if you can't get other people excited
about it, it's really hard to be successful

00:29:30.679 --> 00:29:31.860
with something.

00:29:31.860 --> 00:29:36.629
So, which sort of all adds up in a weird way
to maybe being a good salesman.

00:29:36.629 --> 00:29:37.629
Sort of.

00:29:37.629 --> 00:29:39.510
Not that I've ever gone out and sort of been
a salesman.

00:29:39.510 --> 00:29:42.179
But that's sort of what being a CEO is, right?

00:29:42.179 --> 00:29:44.590
You're trying to get everybody going along
with your ideas.

00:29:44.590 --> 00:29:46.220
When you're going out to acquire these companies.

00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:48.840
All these business you acquire, these people
are making tons of money.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:50.509
They don't want to sell their businesses.

00:29:50.509 --> 00:29:51.509
They had no interest.

00:29:51.509 --> 00:29:56.669
But I had to sell them on the fact, that if
they did not sell it to us, there was a wave

00:29:56.669 --> 00:29:58.169
that would swamp them at some point.

00:29:58.169 --> 00:29:59.620
Four to five years down the road.

00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.999
'Cause we were gonna go buy everybody else.

00:30:01.999 --> 00:30:03.669
And there was going to be a global system.

00:30:03.669 --> 00:30:06.559
And if they weren't part of that global system.

00:30:06.559 --> 00:30:08.570
But you know, I'm just the outsider just saying
this.

00:30:08.570 --> 00:30:10.610
You know, I didn't have anything at the time.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:11.610
[laughter]

00:30:11.610 --> 00:30:18.210
So that is, that's my sort of, biggest skill.

00:30:18.210 --> 00:30:19.919
Right?

00:30:19.919 --> 00:30:21.480
I'm creative.

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:22.799
I paint, play guitar, stuff like that.

00:30:22.799 --> 00:30:24.880
I have an analytical side to me, thankfully.

00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:29.340
So I can you know, do spread sheets, but I
don't have a whole lot of patience for it.

00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:31.779
You know, accounting, legal, process, other
things.

00:30:31.779 --> 00:30:36.610
As we get bigger I get more annoyed with all
the bureaucracy.

00:30:36.610 --> 00:30:39.809
And I'm sure it exists here at Google too.

00:30:39.809 --> 00:30:43.270
So I don't know if that answers your question.

00:30:43.270 --> 00:30:44.929
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:30:44.929 --> 00:30:45.929
I have two questions actually.

00:30:45.929 --> 00:30:51.499
The first is, I, we just learned that, I mean
you guys are based here in Austin.

00:30:51.499 --> 00:30:54.289
Great choice on a location by the way.

00:30:54.289 --> 00:30:57.980
But I know that you guys are kind of all over
the world.

00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:58.980
&gt;&gt;Brian: And we are hiring.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:30:59.980
&gt;&gt;female #1: what's that?

00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:00.980
&gt;&gt;Brian: We are hiring.

00:31:00.980 --> 00:31:01.980
[laughter]

00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:03.490
&gt;&gt;female #1: that was gonna be my next question.

00:31:03.490 --> 00:31:05.340
I'm just kidding.

00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.710
But you do have locations around the world.

00:31:08.710 --> 00:31:12.669
In fact, my best friend's wife works for your
office in Brazil.

00:31:12.669 --> 00:31:13.669
&gt;&gt;Brian: Ah.

00:31:13.669 --> 00:31:14.669
Cool.

00:31:14.669 --> 00:31:15.669
Wow.

00:31:15.669 --> 00:31:16.669
&gt;&gt;female #1: Or one of your partners in Brazil.

00:31:16.669 --> 00:31:20.690
So my question is, how did you decide to expand?

00:31:20.690 --> 00:31:24.409
What was that critical point where you thought,
OK, we need to be in more countries.

00:31:24.409 --> 00:31:31.820
And how did you avoid, hopefully avoid, falling
into the trap of expanding too quickly?

00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:33.009
And spreading yourself thin?

00:31:33.009 --> 00:31:35.220
I've worked for a company that did that.

00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:36.220
So.

00:31:36.220 --> 00:31:37.220
He did too.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:38.220
[laughs]

00:31:38.220 --> 00:31:43.980
&gt;&gt;Brian: So the decision to expand internationally
was just a pretty natural fit with the business.

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.600
So we're in the travel business.

00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:51.399
I mean, just think, for example, if you went
to Expedia and you're about to go to Madrid

00:31:51.399 --> 00:31:56.120
and you type in Madrid looking for a hotel
and it says "Sorry, we don't do Madrid."

00:31:56.120 --> 00:31:57.670
You're like "That's kinda weird.

00:31:57.670 --> 00:31:58.670
You're Expedia.

00:31:58.670 --> 00:32:00.240
You should do Madrid."

00:32:00.240 --> 00:32:02.070
So it's a worldwide business.

00:32:02.070 --> 00:32:07.269
And by definition, we have to cover most of
the major vacation spots around the world.

00:32:07.269 --> 00:32:10.059
So expanding to places like Europe makes a
lot of sense.

00:32:10.059 --> 00:32:11.059
South America.

00:32:11.059 --> 00:32:12.059
Etcetera.

00:32:12.059 --> 00:32:13.059
We're still not in Asia.

00:32:13.059 --> 00:32:14.640
We have lots of places to go.

00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:21.500
And so the first day that we opened our doors,
we acquired both companies in the US and Europe.

00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:22.540
Right from day one.

00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:25.330
Now, the challenge in terms of how you manage
all that's pretty big.

00:32:25.330 --> 00:32:27.961
'Cause you gotta have the right cultural fit
and everything else.

00:32:27.961 --> 00:32:30.740
And one of the things we worked really hard
on is communications.

00:32:30.740 --> 00:32:32.610
We were, another Austin company here called
Life Size.

00:32:32.610 --> 00:32:39.320
A friend of mine here that started was a pioneer
in high definition video conferencing.

00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.669
And for you know, small startup company, you
don't usually invest in that stuff.

00:32:43.669 --> 00:32:44.669
But we invested in it from day one.

00:32:44.669 --> 00:32:45.669
We put in an office.

00:32:45.669 --> 00:32:46.929
We put in big 60 inch monitors.

00:32:46.929 --> 00:32:49.179
We've got a high definition video conferencing.

00:32:49.179 --> 00:32:53.279
Because it's just so important for people
to communicate and touch base.

00:32:53.279 --> 00:32:58.499
We're also pretty diligent about making sure
that the companies we acquire, English is

00:32:58.499 --> 00:33:02.780
the primary, not the primary, but the founders
of those companies speak really good English.

00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.470
If they don't, they don't make sense to be
there.

00:33:04.470 --> 00:33:08.149
If the staff doesn't speak English, we send
in English teachers.

00:33:08.149 --> 00:33:10.869
Just because we need to have that communication.

00:33:10.869 --> 00:33:12.450
Now in terms of expanding.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:13.770
You're absolutely right.

00:33:13.770 --> 00:33:19.350
We have been, at times, I felt like we've
been on the borderline because one of the

00:33:19.350 --> 00:33:23.679
things that's happened to us when you buy
multiple companies in multiple languages,

00:33:23.679 --> 00:33:26.559
they come with multiple platforms in multiple
languages.

00:33:26.559 --> 00:33:29.899
All those different platforms add complexity
and cost.

00:33:29.899 --> 00:33:32.230
We had about 14 different platforms in the
business.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:33.580
We're now down to four.

00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:37.409
We're about to be down to three hopefully
in a couple of months, we have a goal in a

00:33:37.409 --> 00:33:40.169
year of being down finally to one platform.

00:33:40.169 --> 00:33:42.730
That almost broke us, just from a technology
perspective.

00:33:42.730 --> 00:33:43.869
From a people perspective.

00:33:43.869 --> 00:33:47.360
From a now that we're public, from a stocks
compliance perspective.

00:33:47.360 --> 00:33:51.389
Think about all these platforms and you've
gotta manage all the security holes and risks

00:33:51.389 --> 00:33:53.160
and finance stuff and everything else.

00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:56.630
And so for that reason, we're not in eastern
Europe.

00:33:56.630 --> 00:33:57.750
We're not in Africa.

00:33:57.750 --> 00:33:58.870
We're not in Asia.

00:33:58.870 --> 00:34:01.100
We're not in China, we're not in Japan.

00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:03.330
So we've had to meter it a bit.

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:09.170
And we, this past year, we haven't made any
acquisitions in the last 12 months and the

00:34:09.170 --> 00:34:13.580
reason we didn't is 'cause we were taking
the company public and that was just another

00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:14.980
big sorta strain on the whole thing.

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:20.910
So we have, it's funny, part of our public
story, we're a little bit unique.

00:34:20.910 --> 00:34:24.900
You know you got people out now, whether it's'
Facebook coming out.

00:34:24.900 --> 00:34:26.030
People like Pandora.

00:34:26.030 --> 00:34:27.030
LinkedIn.

00:34:27.030 --> 00:34:28.030
Others.

00:34:28.030 --> 00:34:32.000
Who are really in the business right now of
spending as much money as they can to get

00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.280
as much topline growth as they can.

00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:37.280
And we've taken a very different approach
with the market, and have been rewarded with

00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:38.850
a pretty good multiple, which is.

00:34:38.850 --> 00:34:40.880
We're a little bit different.

00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:42.570
We're the disciplined guys.

00:34:42.570 --> 00:34:48.340
So we're gonna deliver really steady 30 percent
growth in this business.

00:34:48.340 --> 00:34:49.980
And we're gonna make money.

00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.450
And we're not gonna dump everything.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:54.770
We can't, sure we could grow the business
faster if we put everything into growth.

00:34:54.770 --> 00:34:56.750
If we opened offices all over the world.

00:34:56.750 --> 00:34:59.500
And there are a lot of internet companies
that do that.

00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:00.760
That's just not our thing.

00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:01.850
We just work.

00:35:01.850 --> 00:35:04.920
Again it comes back to that little video in
the beginning.

00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:10.750
I got my finger burned and so I operate in
a much more risk averse environment.

00:35:10.750 --> 00:35:12.940
But there's a group of investors who love
that.

00:35:12.940 --> 00:35:15.820
And especially today, that's what they wanna
hear.

00:35:15.820 --> 00:35:17.660
So that's the guys we cater to.

00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.430
There are other people who want growth at
all costs.

00:35:19.430 --> 00:35:25.130
And you know they go invest in people like
Pandora, I guess.

00:35:25.130 --> 00:35:26.130
Yeah.

00:35:26.130 --> 00:35:31.660
&gt;&gt;female #2: Sorry if you, if you answered
this earlier, apologizing in advance.

00:35:31.660 --> 00:35:38.990
But, so when you guys were first starting
out, what was your biggest challenge in creating

00:35:38.990 --> 00:35:40.980
a following for HomeAway.

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:41.980
When you were brand new?

00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:46.770
What kind of tools did you use to gather users
and subscribers?

00:35:46.770 --> 00:35:52.240
&gt;&gt;Brian: Most of the early days of this company
was being really good at SEO.

00:35:52.240 --> 00:35:54.860
I mean we've got Google to thank.

00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:57.170
Clearly for a big chunk of our traffic.

00:35:57.170 --> 00:35:59.500
And that was sort of the first couple years.

00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:04.310
Then we found religion with paying you guys
lots of money on top of that to goose it.

00:36:04.310 --> 00:36:05.310
[audience chatter]

00:36:05.310 --> 00:36:06.420
So we paid for that.

00:36:06.420 --> 00:36:17.710
Then we got religion around recommendations
and not, and I'll talk about social in a minute,

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.910
around really sort of milking our customer
base.

00:36:19.910 --> 00:36:24.110
So we got very sophisticated about email marketing,
for example.

00:36:24.110 --> 00:36:28.660
So you got millions of people coming in, how
do you make sure that they come back every

00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:29.660
year?

00:36:29.660 --> 00:36:32.910
I, every time you inquire about a house on
HomeAway we know a lot about you.

00:36:32.910 --> 00:36:34.210
We know what you like.

00:36:34.210 --> 00:36:35.340
We know when you wanna travel.

00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.340
And things like that.

00:36:36.340 --> 00:36:41.740
So we've a very sophisticated, now, email
program to really keep that flywheel going.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:45.270
Three years ago I decided that wasn't enough
and it was time for us to start building our

00:36:45.270 --> 00:36:46.270
brand.

00:36:46.270 --> 00:36:50.220
And so we did, three years ago, start doing
brand marketing.

00:36:50.220 --> 00:36:56.440
We're still not big enough to do a huge amount
of it but we started in a big way.

00:36:56.440 --> 00:36:58.590
We started with the Super Bowl three years
ago.

00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:02.260
We brought back the Griswolds from 'Vacation'
fame.

00:37:02.260 --> 00:37:06.920
In fact, we just opened a new office at Penn
Field on South Congress.

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:13.130
Where the Truckster has now its final resting
place in a big garage inside of the office.

00:37:13.130 --> 00:37:14.520
And that was sort of a kickoff.

00:37:14.520 --> 00:37:16.360
And a year later we did something really stupid.

00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:19.790
We did an ad where a baby got thrown against
a window.

00:37:19.790 --> 00:37:22.480
And I had to apologize to the world and we
pulled that ad.

00:37:22.480 --> 00:37:23.480
[laughter]

00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:26.870
But then we got so much publicity from doing
that that it wound up being as good as the

00:37:26.870 --> 00:37:27.870
Griswolds.

00:37:27.870 --> 00:37:32.520
And then this year, we finally decided to
get out of the Super Bowl game and start getting

00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:34.470
into the consistency game.

00:37:34.470 --> 00:37:35.470
Right?

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:40.960
And to develop a message that was timeless
and that we could go with for a long time.

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:47.830
That we could run and build over campaign
seasons as opposed to one event like the Super

00:37:47.830 --> 00:37:48.830
Bowl.

00:37:48.830 --> 00:37:49.830
And it's something I'm really excited about.

00:37:49.830 --> 00:37:51.120
I don't know if you've seen it yet.

00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:52.120
But it's something.

00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:54.440
Our new tag-line for the company is "Let's
stay together."

00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:58.380
'Cause we're all about families and friends
getting together in houses.

00:37:58.380 --> 00:38:04.430
And the famous Al Green song "Let's stay together"
that Obama was singing just a few months ago,

00:38:04.430 --> 00:38:05.970
has now been licensed to us.

00:38:05.970 --> 00:38:07.870
So we use that music in the song.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:12.580
In fact, on April the 26th we are bringing
Al Green to town.

00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:14.210
He's gonna play down at ACL.

00:38:14.210 --> 00:38:17.350
So any Al Green fans who wanna come to that
show.

00:38:17.350 --> 00:38:19.000
It's the first time he's played in two years.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.620
First time he's ever played in Austin.

00:38:21.620 --> 00:38:24.730
So that's now how we do it.

00:38:24.730 --> 00:38:29.120
As far as social is concerned, we're spending
a lot of time on social as well.

00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:32.320
But we haven't really found the magic bullet
on social.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.110
One thing I'll tell you guys that you should
take great comfort in is that we have been

00:38:36.110 --> 00:38:44.040
working very hard to replicate the ROI we
get from advertising on Google, by advertising

00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.040
on Facebook.

00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:48.980
And we have a very sophisticated crew of people
that come out of eBay that's testing this

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:49.980
stuff.

00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:50.980
Every day and all the time.

00:38:50.980 --> 00:38:58.490
As of about a year ago, I reported to my board
that we had gotten the cost of Facebook advertising

00:38:58.490 --> 00:39:04.640
down to 300 times the cost of advertising
on Google.

00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:10.510
About a year later, with a lot of work, we've
gotten down to Facebook being about 50 times

00:39:10.510 --> 00:39:13.450
the cost of advertising on Google.

00:39:13.450 --> 00:39:16.930
And so you can feel pretty secure that at
least for a business like HomeAway, we have

00:39:16.930 --> 00:39:20.320
not yet found.

00:39:20.320 --> 00:39:27.840
People go on social platforms like Facebook
to do other things than look at advertisements.

00:39:27.840 --> 00:39:33.480
And for us when you have a product where somebody
is only maybe twice a year, going out.

00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:34.480
Right?

00:39:34.480 --> 00:39:36.570
You take a couple of vacations a year.

00:39:36.570 --> 00:39:40.190
And you may have a two or three day planning
window for each of those vacations.

00:39:40.190 --> 00:39:42.480
So six days a year.

00:39:42.480 --> 00:39:46.650
I can't hit, we can't, the 50 to one numbers
actually make sense.

00:39:46.650 --> 00:39:51.380
Because just randomly, it's hard to sort of
hit those people exactly where in their process.

00:39:51.380 --> 00:39:54.930
But with Google of course they go to them
and type in "vacation", "vacation rental",

00:39:54.930 --> 00:39:56.140
"looking for a place in Maui."

00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.140
Whatever it is.

00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.020
And we can hit them really efficiently.

00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:01.200
So social still hasn't been a big thing for
us.

00:40:01.200 --> 00:40:05.120
Although we continue to do a lot of work in
that area and maybe someday it will.

00:40:05.120 --> 00:40:08.340
Maybe Google+ is the answer for us.

00:40:08.340 --> 00:40:10.180
&gt;&gt;male #4: Hi Brian.

00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:11.950
First of all lemme just say it's great to
have you here.

00:40:11.950 --> 00:40:13.440
Actually my group works directly with you
guys.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:14.440
&gt;&gt;Brian: Oh, neat.

00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:16.480
&gt;&gt;male #4: Through Stephen Goldberg.

00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:17.480
&gt;&gt;Brian: Uh-huh.

00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:19.100
&gt;&gt;male #4: I'm formerly with DoubleClick.

00:40:19.100 --> 00:40:21.150
So my question to you is very simple actually.

00:40:21.150 --> 00:40:24.020
How has the mortgage crisis hurt or helped
HomeAway?

00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:30.600
&gt;&gt;Brian: I think it's hurt and helped and
they've offset each other.

00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:35.930
So if you look at new listings that come into
our business.

00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:41.710
And you know they come in at a rate of 30,000,
40,000 listings a quarter that get added to

00:40:41.710 --> 00:40:44.000
the pool.

00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:48.760
Going back three, four years ago, a huge percentage
of those were new.

00:40:48.760 --> 00:40:50.270
So, not actually new units.

00:40:50.270 --> 00:40:51.740
But new buyers in the market.

00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.880
So the vacation market prior to the mortgage
crisis was very hot.

00:40:56.880 --> 00:41:02.730
So people were using cheap debt to buy second
homes and you know it's just as it turns out.

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:06.360
And so then developers were building new homes
and about 25 to 30 percent of those people

00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.540
would just rent them out to help pay those
bills.

00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:11.860
So that tap shut off.

00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.031
In fact the numbers, this is how dramatic
they were.

00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:20.950
There were about one point two million vacation
homes being sold a year.

00:41:20.950 --> 00:41:24.340
Up until 2008.

00:41:24.340 --> 00:41:26.350
That number is now about 400,000 a year.

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:27.870
So it's that bad.

00:41:27.870 --> 00:41:34.780
Now the flip side is, that because expenses
have gotten higher for people and part of

00:41:34.780 --> 00:41:38.260
the mortgage crisis was remember, people's
interest rates adjusting and all that kinda

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:39.260
stuff.

00:41:39.260 --> 00:41:42.560
They were paying nothing and now they actually
have to pay interest.

00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:46.210
People who have existing homes have been more
inclined to rent them out.

00:41:46.210 --> 00:41:48.280
'Cause they need the money.

00:41:48.280 --> 00:41:50.020
And that install base is actually pretty big.

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.540
In the US, in Europe, there's about 20 million
people who own vacation homes.

00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.510
And remember today, in a HomeAway, well, we're
not just in the US and Europe, it's the majority

00:41:57.510 --> 00:41:58.510
of our listings.

00:41:58.510 --> 00:42:04.800
We have 650,000 homes right now, but there's
20 million of them out there.

00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:10.280
And if you go back four or five years ago
when we would survey it, about 25 percent

00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:13.080
of the second home owners in the US and Europe
rented.

00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.370
That number is closer to 30, 31 percent today.

00:42:16.370 --> 00:42:18.400
So it's just been trending up year after year.

00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:21.860
And the two just have kind of offset each
other.

00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.630
And the bottom line is we haven't really seen
a huge impact in our trajectory because of

00:42:25.630 --> 00:42:26.630
it.

00:42:26.630 --> 00:42:28.030
&gt;&gt;male #5: Brian.

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:30.880
Thank you for coming today.

00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:33.000
Earlier you mentioned that you went to business
school.

00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:37.480
And I've read a lot of literature that argues
that business school may or may not be the

00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:38.730
best fit for entrepreneurs.

00:42:38.730 --> 00:42:40.140
Maybe they should just jump in.

00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:44.630
Could you maybe speak a little bit about that
and your thoughts on how business school did

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:45.650
or did not help you?

00:42:45.650 --> 00:42:48.680
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yeah, you know I've thought at times
about writing a book.

00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.790
And somebody once did.

00:42:49.790 --> 00:42:54.590
"What they never taught me at Harvard Business
School" or something like that.

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.521
Harvey MacKay or whoever wrote that book.

00:42:56.521 --> 00:42:59.760
I feel that way a lot.

00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.500
That business school was highly academic and
when you get out in the real world, most of

00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.670
what I've learned I feel like I've learned
sort of pure trial by fire.

00:43:09.670 --> 00:43:15.160
And I can't really go back and say "God, if
it weren't for this class, I never would have

00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:16.160
been successful."

00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:20.090
So that part of it I'd say is true.

00:43:20.090 --> 00:43:23.000
The flip side is, I was lucky enough to get
into Stanford Business School.

00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:27.300
And Stanford Business School, as is Harvard
Business School.

00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:33.220
And maybe there are a few others as well,
comes not just with education but with some

00:43:33.220 --> 00:43:35.180
pretty damn good connections.

00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:38.180
So if you look at my board for example.

00:43:38.180 --> 00:43:43.350
Jeff Brody with Redpoint was one of my buddies
at business school.

00:43:43.350 --> 00:43:46.750
Became one of the biggest venture capitalists
in Silicon Valley, him along with Geoff Yang

00:43:46.750 --> 00:43:49.790
and John Walecka and his partners, who also
went to Stanford Business School.

00:43:49.790 --> 00:43:51.580
The guys are all old friends of mine, he's
on my board.

00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:53.950
John Moragne from Trident is one of our early
investors.

00:43:53.950 --> 00:43:57.300
He's on our board, from Stanford Business
School, was one of my friends at business

00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.300
school.

00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:01.840
Not that I couldn't have gotten financing
without those guys.

00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:07.270
But because of those relationships I gotta
tell ya, it's a lot easier, there's a lot

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.560
more trust.

00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:10.660
I get to work with friends.

00:44:10.660 --> 00:44:11.660
You know?

00:44:11.660 --> 00:44:12.660
That I know.

00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:17.980
And so there's a net work there at least out
in California that being here in Austin it

00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:22.050
would be pretty hard to be tapped into if
I hadn't gone there.

00:44:22.050 --> 00:44:26.480
So I donate money to the school and I thank
them every day.

00:44:26.480 --> 00:44:31.970
But it's not necessarily because what I learned
in the classroom was the part that I'm applying

00:44:31.970 --> 00:44:34.270
in my life at this point.

00:44:34.270 --> 00:44:35.800
If that makes sense.

00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:37.720
&gt;&gt;male #6: Brian, thank you.

00:44:37.720 --> 00:44:41.980
I've talked to a lot of people that have been
employed by HomeAway and they all say that

00:44:41.980 --> 00:44:44.800
their hiring process was very unique.

00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:48.790
And they felt like they were hired as the
individual rather than filling a specific

00:44:48.790 --> 00:44:49.790
position.

00:44:49.790 --> 00:44:56.890
And that you take a real pride in people that
you work for, finding, I guess, new opportunities

00:44:56.890 --> 00:44:58.370
for them inside your organization.

00:44:58.370 --> 00:45:02.670
Can you speak to the benefit of hiring for
individuals rather than filling positions?

00:45:02.670 --> 00:45:03.670
&gt;&gt;Brian: yeah.

00:45:03.670 --> 00:45:05.400
I mean, I've heard anyway.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.050
Nobody does that better than Google.

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.440
So my guess is we're pretty similar in that
regard.

00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:13.100
Except that I'm not sure that we give people
brain teasers or math tests or stuff like

00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:14.100
that.

00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:17.370
[laughter] But it, no, fit is the most important
thing for us.

00:45:17.370 --> 00:45:22.540
We really do have a really do have a really
good group of friendly people who like to

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:23.720
work together.

00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:28.670
And we stress for everybody that the fit has
to be right like the number one thing I can't

00:45:28.670 --> 00:45:29.670
stand is ego.

00:45:29.670 --> 00:45:30.670
As I talked about.

00:45:30.670 --> 00:45:33.090
We like humble people who don't have big egos.

00:45:33.090 --> 00:45:37.460
And so that is as important to us as somebody's
background.

00:45:37.460 --> 00:45:40.640
And I think it's for exactly the reason you
say.

00:45:40.640 --> 00:45:46.200
When you're a company that's growing fast,
the positions are just gonna kind a change

00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200
constantly.

00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:49.535
I mean you're constantly having to evolve
and move people to different places.

00:45:49.535 --> 00:45:54.810
And so what you hire people fore in the initial
job ends up being pretty irrelevant in a growth

00:45:54.810 --> 00:45:55.810
company.

00:45:55.810 --> 00:45:58.480
And so you look for the term people use are
"good athletes."

00:45:58.480 --> 00:46:02.640
You're looking for good athletes as opposed
to somebody who's really good at a specific

00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:03.640
thing.

00:46:03.640 --> 00:46:08.730
I don't know if we have any magic formula
and do it any better than anyone else.

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.830
I don't think we necessarily people on you
have to ask these kinds of questions.

00:46:11.830 --> 00:46:18.370
I think we just hire the kinds of people who
instinctively know that we wanna continue

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:21.510
to hire against our culture.

00:46:21.510 --> 00:46:24.704
And it seems to have worked out pretty well.

00:46:24.704 --> 00:46:26.130
&gt;&gt;female #3: I have one final question.

00:46:26.130 --> 00:46:29.980
What is one of the craziest listings you've
seen on your HomeAway.

00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:32.890
&gt;&gt;Brian: I don't know.

00:46:32.890 --> 00:46:36.280
Eileen you may know better than me.

00:46:36.280 --> 00:46:37.280
Craziest listing.

00:46:37.280 --> 00:46:39.360
People have listed some pretty

00:46:39.360 --> 00:46:41.120
[audience question off mic]

00:46:41.120 --> 00:46:43.720
Oh, that's the best!

00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:44.720
[laughter]

00:46:44.720 --> 00:46:45.720
That's the best.

00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.161
So VRBO, actually we bought it.

00:46:47.161 --> 00:46:48.460
It was a very religious company actually.

00:46:48.460 --> 00:46:54.560
It was like, it was founded by a guy who was
part of this church.

00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:57.310
And almost everyone in the company when we
bought it was part of this church.

00:46:57.310 --> 00:46:59.830
And it's a pretty conservative deal you know.

00:46:59.830 --> 00:47:01.720
They don't drink, they don't.

00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:08.440
And so they, people sometimes when they submit
photos will put photos of themselves in bikinis

00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.710
on the beach.

00:47:09.710 --> 00:47:10.930
And they even, bikini, no way.

00:47:10.930 --> 00:47:12.520
They would just edit that stuff out.

00:47:12.520 --> 00:47:16.220
Well people started, then we bought the company,
people started to do really tricky things.

00:47:16.220 --> 00:47:18.590
I'm, people like to see themselves naked online
I guess.

00:47:18.590 --> 00:47:22.900
Where they do things like, there'd be a room,
and there'd be a mirror in it.

00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:27.120
And you'd see in the mirror them sort of naked
in the background.

00:47:27.120 --> 00:47:28.630
[laughter]

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:32.360
So those are the funniest things that happen.

00:47:32.360 --> 00:47:37.290
And they, and when it happens, I hate to say
it, it does get passed around.

00:47:37.290 --> 00:47:38.290
[laughter]

00:47:38.290 --> 00:47:39.290
So.

00:47:39.290 --> 00:47:40.290
Makes our day.

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.290
[laughter]

00:47:41.290 --> 00:47:42.290
[presenter off mic]

00:47:42.290 --> 00:47:47.350
&gt;&gt;male #6: You mentioned that you're involved
in maybe investing or part of startups.

00:47:47.350 --> 00:47:49.010
Are you actively looking for startups?

00:47:49.010 --> 00:47:50.710
And which ones are you already a part of?

00:47:50.710 --> 00:47:52.750
And maybe can you expound on that a little
bit?

00:47:52.750 --> 00:47:58.940
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yeah, I mean my time is not, I don't
have a lot of free time.

00:47:58.940 --> 00:48:00.210
At the moment.

00:48:00.210 --> 00:48:02.590
To put a lot into stuff.

00:48:02.590 --> 00:48:08.930
So, but I have a sweet spot for people who
like to do entrepreneurial things.

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:13.860
And I love to take their phone calls and I
love to help them.

00:48:13.860 --> 00:48:14.860
I speak a lot to entrepreneurs.

00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:19.580
And if there are business plans out there
that I get excited about, then I do put money

00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.580
into things.

00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:26.010
And there's a combination of several small
private things that people are working on

00:48:26.010 --> 00:48:28.310
and don't necessarily want to disclose yet.

00:48:28.310 --> 00:48:31.610
And then I look for in Austin things to get
involved with that I think are pretty hot.

00:48:31.610 --> 00:48:32.610
There's a deal here in town.

00:48:32.610 --> 00:48:34.810
I mentioned I was on the board of Kayak.

00:48:34.810 --> 00:48:39.710
I'm also on the board of a company called
WhaleShark Media here in town you may have

00:48:39.710 --> 00:48:40.710
heard of.

00:48:40.710 --> 00:48:43.400
And WhaleShark, it's kind of, I would call
it a quasi HomeAway spinout.

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.240
'Cause it was started by two guys, Cotter
Cunningham and Justin Halloran.

00:48:47.240 --> 00:48:53.860
Justin was one of our senior guys who came
out of eBay and decided to go do WhaleShark

00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:56.100
'cause it was a good opportunity for him.

00:48:56.100 --> 00:48:57.730
And so I invested with that company.

00:48:57.730 --> 00:48:58.930
I'm working with that company.

00:48:58.930 --> 00:49:02.830
I think it's a very hot company that's gonna
be a huge success and very excited about it.

00:49:02.830 --> 00:49:04.790
And Google Ventures is investing in that company
as well.

00:49:04.790 --> 00:49:09.060
They, because of our relationship, they came
in and it's been wonderful.

00:49:09.060 --> 00:49:13.800
So yeah, if you've got something cool, I'd
love to hear about it.

00:49:13.800 --> 00:49:18.620
&gt;&gt;Female Presenter: Well, I want to everybody
for showing up today, and we wanna give you

00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:20.292
a Google Awesome t-shirt on behalf of Google
Talks.

00:49:20.292 --> 00:49:21.292
[applause]

00:49:21.292 --> 00:49:22.292
&gt;&gt;Brian: Yay!

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.292
I was actually jealous.

00:49:23.292 --> 00:49:25.040
There's so many people wearing Google stuff.

00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.240
People are never wearing HomeAway stuff.

00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.770
We don't give out enough, I guess.

00:49:28.770 --> 00:49:29.770
[laughter]

00:49:29.770 --> 00:49:30.770
&gt;&gt;Brian: Anyway, thank you, that's wonderful.

00:49:30.770 --> 00:49:31.770
I appreciate it.

00:49:31.770 --> 00:49:32.770
Oh!

00:49:32.770 --> 00:49:33.770
I spoke.

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:34.770
Y'all.

00:49:34.770 --> 00:49:35.770
Pretty hip.

00:49:35.770 --> 00:49:36.770
Cool.

00:49:36.770 --> 00:49:36.771
Thanks.
