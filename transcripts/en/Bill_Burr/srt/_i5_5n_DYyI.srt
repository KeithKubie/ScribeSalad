1
00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,450
Yeah.

2
00:00:01,450 --> 00:00:03,100
Hey, what's going on? It's bill bird.

3
00:00:03,101 --> 00:00:07,660
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, June 6th,

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:10,990
2016 this is like the fifth fucking time
I've tried to start this thing because,

5
00:00:11,320 --> 00:00:15,280
uh, I dunno, I just had an aborted
landing. Well, I didn't have one.

6
00:00:15,370 --> 00:00:18,270
The pilot had one and a, I was
riding in the back and, you know,

7
00:00:18,380 --> 00:00:21,250
what are you going to do? What
we landed safely, you know,

8
00:00:21,610 --> 00:00:25,300
some airplane didn't clear the runway.
That was my fifth one that I've had.

9
00:00:25,360 --> 00:00:30,100
I've had five aborted landings and
that was my second one at lax. Um,

10
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:33,520
first one was vehicle on a runway
and this next one, a guy didn't,

11
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,010
a plane was still on the runway. It
didn't clear it or whatever, but uh,

12
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:41,560
it was a little less scary. Now
that I've flown a little bit,

13
00:00:42,040 --> 00:00:44,110
you know, not a lot, but
a little bit, but, uh,

14
00:00:44,290 --> 00:00:46,810
you're still in the back and you
can't see what's going on. So that's,

15
00:00:47,020 --> 00:00:50,830
that's always nice. Um, all right.

16
00:00:50,831 --> 00:00:54,070
So people have been asking
me, they've been emailing me,

17
00:00:54,340 --> 00:00:57,300
they'd been twittering me,
they'd been Facebooking me. Um,

18
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:01,540

Around SCIATICA. It's still acting up.

51
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:07,300
I'm going to every fucking witch
doctor out here at this point.

52
00:03:07,301 --> 00:03:09,010
I don't give a shit. You know,

53
00:03:09,011 --> 00:03:12,490
some woman was talking to me was saying
how she got Sciatica when she was

54
00:03:12,491 --> 00:03:16,060
pregnant and it was just like, he
called me fat and she, she laughed.

55
00:03:16,061 --> 00:03:19,180
She's like, no, she goes, I
just, I just got it. And uh,

56
00:03:19,210 --> 00:03:21,520
she went someplace and she goes,

57
00:03:21,521 --> 00:03:25,540
they just kinda lightly
just with on my backside.

58
00:03:25,990 --> 00:03:27,490
I thought they were really
gonna need in there.

59
00:03:27,491 --> 00:03:29,130
They just kinda lightly wants like what?

60
00:03:29,131 --> 00:03:32,020
That nobody's fucking putting
leaves on my butt cheeks.

61
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:36,700
I'm going to go to everybody
else first before that. Um,

62
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:40,690
but I gotta tell you like
something happens with the
air pressure when I'm on a

63
00:03:40,691 --> 00:03:44,880
plane, the back of my leg, it feels
like my hamstrings gonna snap. Uh,

64
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:49,980
so I got to keep standing up doing my
Vietnamese gambler fucking squat and um,

65
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:53,710
I dunno. I'm trying to
stretch out the PSOAS muscle.

66
00:03:53,711 --> 00:03:57,220
I'm doing everything I can to try to
keep this thing at bay cause I don't

67
00:03:57,221 --> 00:04:00,490
fucking have the time to take care of it.

68
00:04:00,520 --> 00:04:02,800
I just don't have to
fucking busy here with, uh,

69
00:04:03,220 --> 00:04:06,430
writing this filthy wonderful cartoon,
which I'm having a great time doing.

70
00:04:06,431 --> 00:04:11,110
I bopped episode six this week. People
up to episode six writing as far,

71
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:15,730
far as that aspect of it. I literally
signed to fucking Raymond. All right,

72
00:04:15,731 --> 00:04:20,410
let me take you through my trip here.
All right. I had some fucking guy,

73
00:04:21,310 --> 00:04:24,630
he was like in his early sixties give
me this fucking look like he was gonna

74
00:04:24,640 --> 00:04:28,480
Punch me in the face to the point
I had to say something to him.

75
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,890
And I know you guys are
thinking like, Bill,

76
00:04:29,891 --> 00:04:34,210
what the fuck you're talking shit to a
guy 63 well I'm going to be 48 this week.

77
00:04:34,211 --> 00:04:38,260
So you know when I was 15 he
was 30 so it's not that bad.

78
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,850
We're pretty close, right?
When I was 10 he was 25 right.

79
00:04:42,851 --> 00:04:43,481
But you know,

80
00:04:43,481 --> 00:04:46,600
you think he wouldn't have picked on
me back then is what happened. Right?

81
00:04:47,590 --> 00:04:52,030
So I went down, go around
in the airport, right?

82
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,470
I got bumped up the business.
So I get to go first.

83
00:04:56,471 --> 00:04:58,250
I get to go into the lounge, right?

84
00:04:58,260 --> 00:05:01,090
I get to go in and fucking pour
myself some cornflakes or whatever.

85
00:05:01,091 --> 00:05:05,700
So I go into the lounge and there's this
fucking guy, right. He just, I dunno,

86
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:09,460
I just, I got on the elevator and he was
there and he was kind of in my space,

87
00:05:10,300 --> 00:05:12,490
but he was a little
oblivious or whatever. Right.

88
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,270
Fucking horseshoe level
bald and he dies the sides,

89
00:05:16,271 --> 00:05:18,100
which is always hysterical
to me. Like, dude,

90
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:22,570
what the why you still dying that you
think that makes you look younger? Um,

91
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:26,140
so anyways, it's like five in the
fucking was before five in the morning.

92
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:27,760
Cause that's what time my
flight is. And you know,

93
00:05:27,761 --> 00:05:31,060
I go up to the lounge and I set my
shit down. He goes his other way.

94
00:05:31,061 --> 00:05:32,470
I'm not even thinking about this guy.

95
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:37,500
And then I'm walking over to where
the cereal is and so is he all right?

96
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,770
Like two planes about to land,
you know, on the same runway.

97
00:05:41,771 --> 00:05:45,310
I'm in front of them, I have priority.
So I walk over there and then he,

98
00:05:46,120 --> 00:05:49,210
I feel him standing way
close to close to me.

99
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:54,790
And when I finished, you know, I
just did a couple of turns, you know,

100
00:05:54,791 --> 00:05:57,190
the fucking Ciro thing.
Couple turns of the KNOB,

101
00:05:57,710 --> 00:06:00,230
it goes into the bowl and
then I pour some milk in it.

102
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:04,610
It probably took me less than 15 seconds
to do that. And when I turned around,

103
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:06,380
cause I just felt him, I would
have turned the other way.

104
00:06:06,381 --> 00:06:10,280
But I felt him on my left shoulder turn
and looked at him and he was glaring at

105
00:06:10,281 --> 00:06:14,900
me showing me all of his bottom
teeth. You know, he's like,

106
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:17,270
Eh, except he wasn't making that noise.

107
00:06:17,271 --> 00:06:19,660
But you know the face
you make when you eh,

108
00:06:19,700 --> 00:06:23,810
that's what he was looking
at me just glaring at me.

109
00:06:25,670 --> 00:06:27,080
So what the fuck did I say to them?

110
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:28,030
Okay.

111
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:32,040
I just looked down, I was like, I
am. I said, are you, I go, you are,

112
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:34,810
you are right. That's why
I said, are you all right?

113
00:06:36,370 --> 00:06:37,660
And then he didn't say anything.

114
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,763
Yeah.

115
00:06:39,210 --> 00:06:43,470
And then I felt bad like, oh man was,
was he like one of those old guys?

116
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,960
Remember I did that bit.
The old man face was that,

117
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:47,700
is that the beginning of the old man face?

118
00:06:47,701 --> 00:06:51,720
You start glaring at first and
then you gradually get more scared.

119
00:06:51,750 --> 00:06:53,870
I have no idea. Right. Um,

120
00:06:55,640 --> 00:06:57,630
it's like those old people
know they're going to hell.

121
00:06:58,260 --> 00:07:00,060
They're thinking back on their
life and they're trying to think,

122
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:02,430
do they have enough time to
say enough hair, Hail Mary's?

123
00:07:03,150 --> 00:07:04,620
And they just realized
they can't. They're like,

124
00:07:05,730 --> 00:07:08,730
they probably saw ghosts and saw those
creepy things coming up from hell.

125
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,590
So anyways, he didn't say anything.

126
00:07:10,591 --> 00:07:14,910
So I walk away and I'm thinking that
feeling bad. Like, aw man, I, I,

127
00:07:16,110 --> 00:07:18,180
I, uh, you know, I just
fucking yelled at that old,

128
00:07:18,210 --> 00:07:21,810
I didn't yell at the old guy, but
I kind of gave him shit, you know,

129
00:07:21,811 --> 00:07:26,700
so I felt bad then went over to sit down
and then he gets his fucking cereal and

130
00:07:26,780 --> 00:07:29,940
at this point, you know, I'm like, I'm
like fucking 20 yards away from this guy,

131
00:07:30,180 --> 00:07:33,510
sit down and he fucking turns around
and as he's walking over to his wife,

132
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:36,990
he looks at me and goes, hey
man, shakes his fucking head up.

133
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:38,340
She was glaring at me.

134
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:40,410
Okay.

135
00:07:40,410 --> 00:07:45,060
So later I go to get up to get a fucking
apple and I knew where he was going to

136
00:07:45,061 --> 00:07:47,890
be looking at him. And I
looked right over at him and I,

137
00:07:47,891 --> 00:07:50,050
I can't remember what the fuck I did.
And then I was like, really, Bill,

138
00:07:50,051 --> 00:07:52,980
are you really doing this? Neither
one of these is going to fight.

139
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:57,600
You're both too fucking old to fight.
And that's how my trip started.

140
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:03,860
So I should have known that it was
going to be a weird travel experience.

141
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:09,300
Um, ended up getting into a Syracuse.
That's what I was going the first night.

142
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,050
And we played this minor
league hockey arena and, uh,

143
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:18,060
I didn't know at the time until I
got there. They actually, uh, filmed,

144
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:22,050
um, that's where they filmed slapshot a
lot of it when they did all this stuff,

145
00:08:22,051 --> 00:08:22,201
you know,

146
00:08:22,201 --> 00:08:25,470
I'm listening to the fucking song when
they were on the ice and everything,

147
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:28,020
so that was cooly shit. Um,

148
00:08:28,950 --> 00:08:32,430
the next night we did another one of those
small hockey arenas and then that one

149
00:08:32,431 --> 00:08:35,970
they told me that was the place
Elvis was supposed to perform at.

150
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:40,800
Um, but he died the day before.
That was his next concert.

151
00:08:41,460 --> 00:08:44,490
And so they still have all these Elvis
tickets and they actually gave me this

152
00:08:44,491 --> 00:08:49,491
little frame thing of a couple
of Elvis tickets and then a,

153
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:53,310
the date that I played there
was really fucking cool. Um,

154
00:08:55,420 --> 00:08:58,790
what the fuck did I go after that?
Oh, then I went down to ball.

155
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,180
I was driving from Portland back
to fucking Albany. Who's kidding?

156
00:09:02,181 --> 00:09:04,980
Who I wasn't fucking
[inaudible] was riding.

157
00:09:05,010 --> 00:09:08,850
We were in this SUV and I was laying
down in the back seat because my fucking

158
00:09:08,851 --> 00:09:13,730
leg was killing me. Um, it's shit's
really starting to scare me, man.

159
00:09:13,750 --> 00:09:15,450
Like how fucking long is this gonna take?

160
00:09:15,451 --> 00:09:17,520
I've been dealing with
this shit since February.

161
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:21,780
Every time I start to turn the corner,
I got to get on a plane again. So

162
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:27,360
people always stare at me too. When I
stand up on the plane, I squat down.

163
00:09:27,361 --> 00:09:29,400
I don't even give a fuck.
And they just looking at me.

164
00:09:29,640 --> 00:09:31,860
I told you in the last time this
guy asked me if I was praying.

165
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,710
So, um, anyways, in the
final show last night was,

166
00:09:40,711 --> 00:09:43,650
was in Albany, but I actually,
when we drove from Portland,

167
00:09:44,430 --> 00:09:47,760
which so many memories came back
when we went over that bridge,

168
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:50,710
when we went over this bridge and, uh,

169
00:09:51,420 --> 00:09:55,470
we go from New Hampshire to Maine
and I remember I used to fucking,

170
00:09:55,620 --> 00:09:58,650
one of my first girlfriends used
to live over there. Brandon,

171
00:09:58,651 --> 00:10:00,060
the other side of that,
well, she didn't live there.

172
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:02,220
She lived down in the Boston area,
but she had like family up there.

173
00:10:02,221 --> 00:10:04,920
I remember going up on over that
bridge. I always think of that shit.

174
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:08,580
I always think about the ticket that I
got on the fucking turnpike up there,

175
00:10:08,940 --> 00:10:13,380
driving my piece of shit truck back.
Um, the comedy connection up there,

176
00:10:13,381 --> 00:10:17,190
all of that shit. And,
um, I gotta tell you, man,

177
00:10:17,191 --> 00:10:21,360
just living out here in la, lay all
people in New York for Mont New Hampshire,

178
00:10:21,450 --> 00:10:22,890
in Western mass in Maine.

179
00:10:22,890 --> 00:10:27,890
I hope they realize how fucking lucky
they are to live where it rains and

180
00:10:28,290 --> 00:10:31,920
there's all that lush land. I'm
so fucking jealous of that shit.

181
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,720
Like when I came back, um, we would,

182
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,270
when we would drive in from
Portland to, uh, Albany,

183
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:42,510
I actually went down to the Boston area
to visit some family and friends and

184
00:10:42,511 --> 00:10:47,120
stop off and one of my favorite
pizza places and uh, I,

185
00:10:47,590 --> 00:10:52,350
we can't ended up coming down route
one in them fucking memories that were

186
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:53,250
coming back.

187
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,650
There was this strip club up there that
was the hilltop steakhouse would say now

188
00:10:58,651 --> 00:10:59,970
completely knocked down.

189
00:11:00,210 --> 00:11:04,140
I hope that signed cause it's
still up that giant fucking cactus.

190
00:11:04,350 --> 00:11:08,610
I hope somehow like
that thing is protected.

191
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:11,430
You know what I mean?
You know, it's funny.

192
00:11:11,490 --> 00:11:15,330
That's like one of those dumb things
they'll sell on fucking Ebay for like 1

193
00:11:15,330 --> 00:11:18,630
million bucks and it'll say like 15
people are watching this, you know,

194
00:11:18,750 --> 00:11:20,790
do you know like, like back
in the day how they used to,

195
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,840
they used to catch people with
warrants. They would just have a,

196
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,970
like during like a fight or something,
they would just advertise a, hey,

197
00:11:29,971 --> 00:11:32,100
you're the, you're the
20th person to order this.

198
00:11:32,400 --> 00:11:34,470
Come down here and claim your free gift.

199
00:11:35,070 --> 00:11:37,800
And they'd call these people up and they
would all go down and claim the gifts

200
00:11:37,801 --> 00:11:40,560
and then I'll be all these people standing
around down there and then the cops

201
00:11:40,561 --> 00:11:43,950
would just walk in and they'd
fucking arrest everybody. Um,

202
00:11:44,310 --> 00:11:47,550
they should fucking do that with,
with dumb shit like that on Ebay.

203
00:11:47,551 --> 00:11:50,610
Like the giant, the
hilltop steakhouse, right?

204
00:11:50,880 --> 00:11:54,520
There's 15 people watching it.
Those 15 people should immediately

205
00:11:54,520 --> 00:11:56,710
be audited. Who would have,

206
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,240
who do Fox got 1 million bucks to
blow on a giant lit up cat. I mean,

207
00:12:01,241 --> 00:12:06,140
everybody wants it. Well, not everybody.
I'd love to have that fucking thing.

208
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:09,530
You know, get yourself to spread
out in the middle of nowhere.

209
00:12:09,531 --> 00:12:13,370
You have a giant lit up cactus.
Your friends come over, right?

210
00:12:13,371 --> 00:12:16,760
Just to make a right at
the giant cactus. You know,

211
00:12:16,761 --> 00:12:20,480
you get a nickname out of it. Oh,
cactus Chris, he's fucking crazy.

212
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:22,473
Um,

213
00:12:22,700 --> 00:12:24,680
but nobody has the money to do that shit.

214
00:12:24,840 --> 00:12:29,130
Right? Like I went on Ebay,
right? And I was, uh, I don't,

215
00:12:29,131 --> 00:12:32,490
what the fuck I was looking, I was
trying to, you know, kill the flight now.

216
00:12:32,491 --> 00:12:37,110
Now you can, you know, go online. So I
was just looking up random shit like, uh,

217
00:12:37,530 --> 00:12:40,410
humidors even though I've gotten
cigars mostly out of my life,

218
00:12:40,411 --> 00:12:42,690
I was just looking him up cause I
think they're fucking cool. Right.

219
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:44,431
Well I know what I was doing,

220
00:12:44,431 --> 00:12:47,910
I was looking at cigar aficionado
and they had all these, you know,

221
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:50,400
cool places where you can smoke a cigar.

222
00:12:50,530 --> 00:12:53,340
They let you know in different cities
like places to smoke and shit. Right?

223
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:58,680
Like I already find a cool place in
London, um, possibly to smoke. We'll see.

224
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,090
And uh, that is if I smoked there, I
don't know, we'll figure it out anyways.

225
00:13:03,720 --> 00:13:07,380
Uh, and that just got me thinking about
cigar smoking and all that type of shit.

226
00:13:07,380 --> 00:13:11,040
So I went on Ebay and a lot of the shit
that comes along with cigar smoke and

227
00:13:11,041 --> 00:13:12,810
it's pretty fucking cool.
A lot of the lighters,

228
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,170
a lot of the ash trays in the humidors
and I like looking at that stuff,

229
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:19,470
especially if they're vintage or
old. So I look up vintage humidor.

230
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:23,430
I'm sure it's still there. And
this, this does this fucking,

231
00:13:24,630 --> 00:13:27,870
I think it's sitting bull.
It's this bust of sitting bull.

232
00:13:29,140 --> 00:13:31,740
All right. That's what
the fucking humidor is.

233
00:13:31,741 --> 00:13:35,490
It's a bust of sitting bull and
what's really fucking, you know,

234
00:13:35,491 --> 00:13:40,110
weird is to to, you know,
put your cigars in it.

235
00:13:40,170 --> 00:13:43,680
You basically take off the scalp, which
I thought was a little fucking tacky,

236
00:13:43,681 --> 00:13:48,360
but granted it's old. That
was considered a Mike.

237
00:13:48,361 --> 00:13:51,690
Totally fine back in the
day. Right? Um, so anyways,

238
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:54,990
this fucking thing is going for
a million and a half dollars

239
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:59,170
and it has, it says like
there's like 20 people watching.

240
00:13:59,190 --> 00:14:03,570
I'm looking it up right
now. ebay.com. All right.

241
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,540
Okay. Vintage you mid door. Boom.

242
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:13,200
All right. What do you got?
What do you got? Oh fuck.

243
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:15,510
Where the hell is it coming? Oh
there it is. Right there sitting

244
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:20,550
both cigar store, Indian statue,
Antique American folk art,

245
00:14:20,850 --> 00:14:23,790
vintage tobacco. You know
what's funny from the side?

246
00:14:23,791 --> 00:14:27,390
It actually looks cool from
straight on. It just looks like,

247
00:14:28,420 --> 00:14:28,810
okay.

248
00:14:28,810 --> 00:14:32,310
I Dunno. It's kind of looking off vague.
He kind of looks sad and then they,

249
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:34,570
I don't understand why.

250
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:35,870
Okay.

251
00:14:35,870 --> 00:14:37,640
This thing is a million and a half bucks.

252
00:14:37,641 --> 00:14:42,641
This 61 people watching this 61 people
have a million and a half dollars to

253
00:14:44,091 --> 00:14:48,450
spend on a fucking humidor. I Dunno.

254
00:14:48,510 --> 00:14:50,370
Like that's the type of shit right there.

255
00:14:50,371 --> 00:14:54,080
Like if I was dodging and taxes and
all that type of shit, you know,

256
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:58,870
go out and do this on the Internet.
Right. I Dunno. That's like whenever you,

257
00:14:58,950 --> 00:15:02,050
you, we have watch shows, make
them car auctions. You know,

258
00:15:02,110 --> 00:15:04,730
when somebody spends 500
grand on a fucking Mustang,

259
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,200
I mean, you're either, you're either
evading taxes or you're a wife beater,

260
00:15:12,260 --> 00:15:14,120
one or the other. Okay.

261
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,720
You're either cheating the fucking system
or your wife is scared to death is of

262
00:15:18,860 --> 00:15:20,600
you that she, she'll
let you fucking do that.

263
00:15:20,601 --> 00:15:25,130
Blow a million and a half bucks
on a humidor looking at Ani

264
00:15:26,650 --> 00:15:29,810
and a great setting. Paul, look
at the top of his head, comes off

265
00:15:31,670 --> 00:15:36,080
like after a fucking autopsy. Um, anyways,

266
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,870
so I can't remember the hell
I was talking about here. Oh.

267
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:43,090
So we end up having to just having
this great anytime I work with furry,

268
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:46,760
we have a great fucking time. Um, when
we were up in Portland after the show,

269
00:15:46,761 --> 00:15:51,620
we had a great time working the, the
uh, the Elvis venue there and um,

270
00:15:52,640 --> 00:15:57,500
we ended up going up to
this bar afterwards and game
three of the Stanley Cup

271
00:15:57,501 --> 00:16:02,000
finals and uh, the UFC
fights were both on it.

272
00:16:02,001 --> 00:16:06,620
Jesus Christ, Dan fucking Anderson.
Do you guys see that knockout?

273
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,590
That was like some Bourne identity shit.

274
00:16:09,890 --> 00:16:14,210
He threw a kick when passed the guy and
then fucking threw an elbow like he was

275
00:16:14,211 --> 00:16:18,180
training in a phone booth. I've
never seen anything like that in run.

276
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:23,230
Long time ago I saw a few FC
fighter basically throw a left hook,

277
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:27,860
but he did it with his knee. He
fucking got rocked in their head.

278
00:16:27,890 --> 00:16:31,690
I think it was that guy that used to
call the little bottle a little ball of

279
00:16:31,691 --> 00:16:35,180
hate. The hell is his name. One of my
favorite fighters back then. Right.

280
00:16:35,181 --> 00:16:36,920
He had hair dyed,

281
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:42,400
like bright red fire engine red and he
got rocked and he started to go down and

282
00:16:43,761 --> 00:16:46,280
the other guy was so
excited to jump on him,

283
00:16:46,590 --> 00:16:49,640
started hitting him that he kind of just
went in with his hands down a little

284
00:16:49,641 --> 00:16:53,720
bit and the fucking guy was
able to regroup and he just,

285
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:57,350
I can't explain it. He threw it.
He need the guy in their head,

286
00:16:57,351 --> 00:17:00,260
but he like came from the
side. He threw a hook.

287
00:17:01,070 --> 00:17:04,580
This fucking guy went down,
gave him the old right there.

288
00:17:04,581 --> 00:17:08,210
Fred with the left knee, Dan
Anderson, the same fucking thing.

289
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:10,820
This guy was just,

290
00:17:10,820 --> 00:17:14,420
he was getting punched in the head
repeatedly and everybody in the bars got,

291
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:17,660
oh right. And I'm yelling
and I actually for once,

292
00:17:18,290 --> 00:17:21,070
cause I don't know shit about fighting.
I go, he's fucking eating those punches.

293
00:17:21,200 --> 00:17:23,630
I'll look at them. And
uh, then next, you know,

294
00:17:23,631 --> 00:17:25,430
he kicks the guy in the fucking head.

295
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,540
He kicked him in the head and then
somehow he was like parallel to the guy's

296
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,830
head and he gave me all that
fucking there with the elbow.

297
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,120
And the guy just went
down. That was it over.

298
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:39,350
And then the coolest thing ever was his
family was there, you know, tell me,

299
00:17:39,351 --> 00:17:42,620
you don't have the coolest dad ever.
Guy Goes shirtless in the ring,

300
00:17:42,800 --> 00:17:46,160
eats fucking 12 punches to the head
and then knocked the other guy out.

301
00:17:46,780 --> 00:17:49,290
You know, you know, it's funny, he
was in better shape than his kids.

302
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,510
He's a 45 year old guy. You
should have the dad bod.

303
00:17:54,810 --> 00:17:58,440
He's up there shredded. His
kids are coming up, you know,

304
00:17:58,441 --> 00:18:01,440
he's making him look soft. Not saying
they were soft. I'm just saying.

305
00:18:01,441 --> 00:18:03,720
Usually by the time you're
45, you have three, four kids.

306
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:05,790
You just got that 600 yard stare.

307
00:18:05,791 --> 00:18:09,360
Like you don't give a fuck if you're
eating a twinkie or a fucking tube sock.

308
00:18:09,361 --> 00:18:13,410
You know, and this guys up there just
was shredded. So once again, once again,

309
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:13,960
UFC

310
00:18:13,960 --> 00:18:18,280
completely worth the fucking
money. Um, the pay to get in.

311
00:18:18,281 --> 00:18:20,320
I missed all the other
fee. Oh No, I saw the uh,

312
00:18:20,321 --> 00:18:23,950
the championship one with a guy there
that I've been watching ever since he was

313
00:18:23,951 --> 00:18:28,330
on, um, the ultimate fighter. The guy
from Manchester, England. Uh, fuck.

314
00:18:28,331 --> 00:18:32,920
I gotta get his name here.
God dammit. Um, I, you know,

315
00:18:32,921 --> 00:18:35,560
I realized when he won, I had been
saying his last name wrong forever.

316
00:18:36,130 --> 00:18:39,370
UFC Champ Manchester.

317
00:18:40,750 --> 00:18:45,340
Here we go. What's his name? Michael
Bisbing. I was, I was Biz Bain.

318
00:18:46,210 --> 00:18:50,080
Michael Bisman. He fucking won.
That was another great one. Um,

319
00:18:51,460 --> 00:18:52,750
what a night. And then as we end,

320
00:18:52,810 --> 00:18:56,510
as we're watching that
simultaneously they watch and uh,

321
00:18:56,650 --> 00:18:58,630
well I guess I was probably the
only one really watching it,

322
00:18:58,631 --> 00:18:59,770
but I was watching the uh,

323
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:04,630
Penguins San Jose and I'm looking
at this shit going like, holy fuck,

324
00:19:05,800 --> 00:19:10,210
it's two to one that carrying the play
and all of a sudden they get a high

325
00:19:10,211 --> 00:19:12,130
stick. I think it was a
four minute power play.

326
00:19:12,131 --> 00:19:15,610
They seem like they were on the power
play for fucking ever long story short

327
00:19:15,611 --> 00:19:19,690
through up to two to one in
the game. And it was like

328
00:19:20,500 --> 00:19:23,680
they killed off like all, all
fucking 20 minutes of this penalty.

329
00:19:23,681 --> 00:19:27,310
It seems like a 20 minute penalty.
Right? They killed his fucking thing off.

330
00:19:27,370 --> 00:19:29,170
There's like two seconds left.

331
00:19:29,680 --> 00:19:32,560
And all I'm thinking in my head
is if they kill off this penalty,

332
00:19:32,790 --> 00:19:34,990
they're going to win this game
and they're going to win the cup.

333
00:19:35,020 --> 00:19:40,020
This is the fucking series and it's
over three to score out of nowhere.

334
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:42,280
I Dunno,

335
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:46,460
I dunno if it was tipped or whatever
after San Jose's goalie made this one of

336
00:19:46,461 --> 00:19:50,420
the sickest, he fucking like saved it
with like the inside of his forearm,

337
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,090
you know, a few minutes earlier
then did any let that one go in

338
00:19:55,290 --> 00:19:59,160
little bit of a floater and now
it's two games to one. Right.

339
00:20:00,210 --> 00:20:02,520
And I don't give a fuck either
way. My team's out of it.

340
00:20:02,940 --> 00:20:05,040
And then my surrogate
team is also a lot of it.

341
00:20:05,310 --> 00:20:08,340
All I know is that means that there's
going to be at least one more game of

342
00:20:08,341 --> 00:20:09,174
hockey.

343
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:13,470
Right. As far as, rather than just
going for games, that'll go five. Right.

344
00:20:13,650 --> 00:20:18,120
So we at least got two more games,
which is good for me because, uh, when,

345
00:20:18,810 --> 00:20:21,480
when the NHL and the NBA seasons end,

346
00:20:21,510 --> 00:20:25,230
I have like a sort of sports panic attack
because they haven't watched it been

347
00:20:25,231 --> 00:20:28,230
watching baseball. I don't know what
the fuck's going on in baseball,

348
00:20:28,231 --> 00:20:31,800
but all I know it's like the middle
of the season. You know Dahlia,

349
00:20:31,830 --> 00:20:32,960
here's the rubber game. Yes.

350
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:37,690
Wow. All out Sadie. He going to see that
slat or a lot this afternoon. You know,

351
00:20:37,780 --> 00:20:38,680
after you just went from,

352
00:20:38,680 --> 00:20:42,520
from like watching people win
championships and playing at that level.

353
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:46,690
Um, that's why the NFL is
the shit as far as like,

354
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:51,490
it actually compete with October baseball
because you figured that the middle of

355
00:20:51,490 --> 00:20:54,970
the NFL season would be
boring. Like most, most sports,

356
00:20:55,870 --> 00:20:58,810
the middle of this season is boring
when you play in like 80 to 162 gangs.

357
00:20:58,811 --> 00:21:03,010
But NFL only plays 16 games.
Every game means so fucking much,

358
00:21:03,790 --> 00:21:05,210
you know? Um,

359
00:21:06,070 --> 00:21:06,440
yeah.

360
00:21:06,440 --> 00:21:11,390
Plus Tom Brady ought to be coming back
from his nice rest, a nice rest, relaxed,

361
00:21:11,420 --> 00:21:15,620
pissed off. Tom Brady coming back
to light she up again. You know,

362
00:21:15,770 --> 00:21:20,410
you guys can look under the rocks and
try to figure out what he's doing some

363
00:21:20,410 --> 00:21:24,710
day, some day you will admit
that he fucking was, you know,

364
00:21:24,810 --> 00:21:29,210
the guy was just a shit. Um,
and then the saddest thing,

365
00:21:29,211 --> 00:21:34,190
obviously the weekend was a, was
the death of Muhammad Ali. Man,

366
00:21:34,220 --> 00:21:38,240
that guy, if you've never
watched when we were kings,

367
00:21:39,820 --> 00:21:40,653
um,

368
00:21:40,890 --> 00:21:43,620
I used to watch it. I used to own that
thing and I used to, I wore it out.

369
00:21:43,680 --> 00:21:45,960
I had an a VHS then he
had on a DVD. I just,

370
00:21:45,961 --> 00:21:49,530
I've watched it so many
fucking times. I just, um,

371
00:21:51,850 --> 00:21:53,230
I don't even know how to
put the guy into words.

372
00:21:53,260 --> 00:21:55,270
It was literally like one out
of, I watched it, I was like,

373
00:21:55,271 --> 00:21:58,890
I have not done shit with my life.
The guy was unbelievable. And when I,

374
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,340
I tweeted, you know, greatest of all
time, greatest athlete, ambassador,

375
00:22:03,341 --> 00:22:07,300
human being of all time and all these,
you know, Twitter cons, come on bill.

376
00:22:07,301 --> 00:22:11,980
He just, he hit things in a ring.
It's like, no, he didn't, he didn't,

377
00:22:11,981 --> 00:22:16,210
he did so much stuff beyond
that. Like, you know,

378
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,920
it says how great mom and I, Lee was

379
00:22:18,760 --> 00:22:18,880
okay.

380
00:22:18,880 --> 00:22:21,220
Like when I said greatest
human ever, I said, really?

381
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:25,870
They're like better than Gandhi.
And it's like, exactly. Exactly.

382
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:27,430
Okay.

383
00:22:27,430 --> 00:22:31,570
If I said fucking Tom Brady,
you know, greatest devil,

384
00:22:31,920 --> 00:22:33,220
you just going to bring
up other quarterbacks.

385
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:37,390
You had to bring up fucking
Gandhi. This is a goddamn athlete.

386
00:22:38,650 --> 00:22:40,060
That's a good comparison.

387
00:22:40,450 --> 00:22:44,980
Cause he was doing Gandhi shit outside
of the ring and he could knock out

388
00:22:44,981 --> 00:22:48,880
anybody in the world. The guy could
hold court in the poorest of the poor,

389
00:22:49,030 --> 00:22:52,240
right up to the White House. When
he walked in, he lit up the room,

390
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:56,710
everybody shut up and you never
forgot it. And uh, and on top of that,

391
00:22:56,740 --> 00:23:00,700
he was one of the greatest fighters
of all time, if not the greatest,

392
00:23:01,960 --> 00:23:02,840
um, [inaudible]

393
00:23:03,550 --> 00:23:06,230
and I got so much out of when
I used to watch that, you know,

394
00:23:06,231 --> 00:23:07,820
when he was talking all that shit,

395
00:23:09,130 --> 00:23:09,963
um,

396
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:13,230
it was like he was almost, as much
as he was talking shit, he was like,

397
00:23:13,350 --> 00:23:14,550
it was like self help.

398
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,120
It's not the way it's done today
where today it's just all like,

399
00:23:18,660 --> 00:23:20,970
it's all perverted. You
know what I mean? It's like,

400
00:23:21,240 --> 00:23:23,850
you know what's going to happen
if you say the crazy shit,

401
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:25,830
you know that you're hype in the fight,

402
00:23:26,190 --> 00:23:27,990
you know that you're going
to get a sneaker deal.

403
00:23:27,991 --> 00:23:29,100
You know all this money's coming.

404
00:23:29,101 --> 00:23:31,230
I'm not saying that he didn't
know that on some level,

405
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:35,200
but the shit that that guy went through,

406
00:23:36,870 --> 00:23:37,703
um,

407
00:23:38,020 --> 00:23:39,100
if you watch some of those early,

408
00:23:39,101 --> 00:23:40,360
especially the ones that
are in black and white,

409
00:23:40,361 --> 00:23:43,300
the fucking white reporters are so
God damn racist. It's like ridiculous.

410
00:23:43,301 --> 00:23:44,000
I remember he,

411
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,720
he just going and going and going and
this reporter's just white guys getting

412
00:23:47,721 --> 00:23:50,960
fucking mad. He just hates
his confidence. This guy,

413
00:23:50,961 --> 00:23:54,500
like if this guy could've got sent into
the future, he'd be a hater on Twitter.

414
00:23:54,501 --> 00:23:57,170
So he finally just goes, do,
do you ever stop talking?

415
00:23:57,890 --> 00:23:59,660
And Ali said something like, now,

416
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:02,210
cause I'm knocking out all
bumps and if you keep talking,

417
00:24:02,211 --> 00:24:05,810
I'm knocking you out too. And
he just, it was the greatest.

418
00:24:05,811 --> 00:24:10,550
He just fucking pissed the guy off and
he knew what the guy was doing and he was

419
00:24:10,551 --> 00:24:11,870
able to navigate all that.

420
00:24:11,871 --> 00:24:15,260
I know everybody says all the terrible
shit that he did to Joe Frazier,

421
00:24:15,261 --> 00:24:17,690
but nobody gets out of this
life without some bad shit.

422
00:24:18,230 --> 00:24:21,760
Everybody's done some bad shit.
You know what I mean? But, um,

423
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:28,030
I dunno man, he still had a good
run though, 70, 74 years. Um,

424
00:24:28,060 --> 00:24:31,420
I used to watch them when I was a
kid. Man, that's how fucking old I am.

425
00:24:31,690 --> 00:24:32,870
That's what's freaking me out now.

426
00:24:32,910 --> 00:24:37,270
It was all these people that were like
in their twenties and thirties when I was

427
00:24:37,271 --> 00:24:41,200
a kid are now dying of like fucking
old age and shit. David Bowie,

428
00:24:41,650 --> 00:24:42,483
Muhammad Ali,

429
00:24:44,350 --> 00:24:47,680
that's fucking freaking me
out. You know what I mean?

430
00:24:47,980 --> 00:24:49,990
Maybe that's why that guy at the, uh,

431
00:24:50,890 --> 00:24:55,210
at the little cereal thing in the
fucking at the airport was giving me that

432
00:24:55,211 --> 00:24:58,270
look. Cause he knows
he's going. So you know,

433
00:24:58,271 --> 00:25:02,520
everybody he knew is
probably all dead right.

434
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:08,010
And He's thinking Alan got so much
time left to get cereal. You know,

435
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:13,040
I was also thinking the fact
that he felt so fucking like he,

436
00:25:13,070 --> 00:25:16,360
the little like the complete lack of
patients that he had and I don't have

437
00:25:16,361 --> 00:25:17,194
patients,

438
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:20,290
the fact that that he couldn't wait
two seconds for me to get some fucking

439
00:25:21,040 --> 00:25:23,530
cheerio's I was also thinking like
that's probably why he's in this lounge.

440
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:29,320
This guy just fucking take it doesn't
take no for an answer. He's a lunatic.

441
00:25:30,460 --> 00:25:31,420
Um, I don't know.

442
00:25:31,421 --> 00:25:33,820
That's kind of fucking depressing
shit that'd be talking about death.

443
00:25:34,040 --> 00:25:34,841
Cause I gotta tell you though, man,

444
00:25:34,841 --> 00:25:38,530
like the amount of fucking people that
have died in the last God damn year,

445
00:25:39,310 --> 00:25:44,080
that I am old enough to have been a
teenager and seeing them in their fucking

446
00:25:44,081 --> 00:25:48,460
prime. Um, how about that print shit? Huh?

447
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:53,140
A person lost to the opiates and
stuff. I just can't put my like,

448
00:25:53,160 --> 00:25:53,993
I can't believe it,

449
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:58,990
but the fact that they actually come at
him and they come at fame and celebrity

450
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,400
and all that type of shit.

451
00:26:00,910 --> 00:26:04,240
Like people are fucking dying.

452
00:26:04,570 --> 00:26:07,620
Regular people are dying because of
their drug. However the fuck you say,

453
00:26:07,630 --> 00:26:10,240
fentanyl or whatever the
hell it is, they get it.

454
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:12,070
Then the prescription runs out,

455
00:26:12,100 --> 00:26:14,530
they're addicted to opiates
and then they get on heroin.

456
00:26:15,070 --> 00:26:19,060
And the fact that they don't talk about
the pharmaceutical companies at all is

457
00:26:19,061 --> 00:26:24,061
because that's like 150 fucking zillion
dollar business and they give money to

458
00:26:24,641 --> 00:26:26,860
the politicians and the advertise on TV.

459
00:26:27,130 --> 00:26:32,130
So they make like prints
out to be like this.

460
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:37,750
Um, this famous guy that P, you know,

461
00:26:38,050 --> 00:26:41,380
nobody could say no to. I
mean, I might be wrong in this,

462
00:26:41,381 --> 00:26:46,200
but I know he had at least one hip if
not two. And if you ever watched the guy,

463
00:26:46,201 --> 00:26:49,110
the guy never took a show off. He
was all over the fucking stage.

464
00:26:49,140 --> 00:26:54,140
I imagine he was in pain and that's
how that shit started was basically him

465
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:58,890
pouring his heart out on
stage, giving everybody 100%.

466
00:26:59,070 --> 00:27:02,310
He wore out his fucking hips. What's
this? James Brown did the same thing.

467
00:27:02,311 --> 00:27:05,070
He had to get new hips. Um,

468
00:27:05,100 --> 00:27:07,530
fortunately by the time
prince got the operation,

469
00:27:07,531 --> 00:27:11,230
hopefully they were further
along and, uh, but I,

470
00:27:11,231 --> 00:27:15,270
I imagine he still had all kinds of pain.
And then I, I that's, that's my guess,

471
00:27:15,271 --> 00:27:18,150
but for the fact that people
came at him, some people,

472
00:27:18,151 --> 00:27:22,380
the way that they came at him was, uh,
I don't know, considering the shows and,

473
00:27:22,670 --> 00:27:26,240
and the music that he left us. I
thought it was really fucking, ah,

474
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,690
it's a little below the
belt though. When you say I,

475
00:27:28,730 --> 00:27:32,100
I think that's a little below the belt.
Have you guys seen this youtube video?

476
00:27:32,101 --> 00:27:35,310
My name is John Dacre. You
gotta Watch this thing.

477
00:27:35,340 --> 00:27:39,450
I apologize cause it's going to be in
your fucking head for the rest of time.

478
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:43,680
I'll, I'll, I'll post the, um, the video,

479
00:27:45,210 --> 00:27:48,930
um, to, um, my, my Twitter
account. He's singing,

480
00:27:49,050 --> 00:27:51,710
he's singing a moray and he
can't remember how to say

481
00:27:55,140 --> 00:27:55,973
[inaudible].

482
00:28:02,820 --> 00:28:03,840
Those will ring

483
00:28:06,260 --> 00:28:09,000
the bell more rarely.

484
00:28:10,010 --> 00:28:14,420
I can't stop watching this
guy, this guy, I swear to God,

485
00:28:14,660 --> 00:28:19,040
I think it's his first TV
Gig. Somebody was sick.

486
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,370
I think they said at the beginning, this
guy fills in and if you look at him,

487
00:28:22,371 --> 00:28:24,830
he's literally having an
outer body experience.

488
00:28:25,160 --> 00:28:28,490
So it's so funny to me because I can
relate to this person because the first

489
00:28:28,491 --> 00:28:31,550
time I did stand up I felt
like I was watching myself.

490
00:28:31,880 --> 00:28:36,440
I've fucked everything up and this
guy, just the way he says his name,

491
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,280
it's almost the just, he says like,

492
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:42,920
my name is John Dacre.

493
00:28:43,750 --> 00:28:44,583
Okay.

494
00:28:44,620 --> 00:28:45,453
Yeah.

495
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:49,890
It's like, it's like he was outsets.

496
00:28:49,900 --> 00:28:53,490
I think that might be my favorite part
of the video is the when this fucking

497
00:28:53,491 --> 00:28:58,080
guy, just the way he says his own name,
he didn't say, my name's John Dacre.

498
00:28:58,350 --> 00:29:03,300
He goes, my name's John Dagger.
I did it right the first time.

499
00:29:03,330 --> 00:29:06,450
I just fucked it up. Hey, you got to
hear this. You hear this fucking guy.

500
00:29:07,710 --> 00:29:11,940
He says he's singing all these
Jesus songs. Hang on, hang on.

501
00:29:14,530 --> 00:29:15,363
Okay.

502
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:18,550
My name is John Dacre.

503
00:29:20,910 --> 00:29:21,743
Okay.

504
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:23,730
That's the funniest shit ever.

505
00:29:26,280 --> 00:29:30,390
My name's John Taker. It's
like he's watching his life,

506
00:29:30,600 --> 00:29:31,890
like he already died

507
00:29:33,570 --> 00:29:37,820
and then he came back
and he just got to like,

508
00:29:37,821 --> 00:29:41,630
he first time you ever realized my
name. My name is John Dager. Yeah. Okay.

509
00:29:42,070 --> 00:29:43,180
That's my fucking name.

510
00:29:43,181 --> 00:29:46,150
And this is my life and I'm on TV
and I'm going to sing this song.

511
00:29:47,780 --> 00:29:49,080
This is what I did with
my life. And these,

512
00:29:49,090 --> 00:29:51,320
you look at the guy fucking poor bastard.

513
00:29:53,430 --> 00:29:54,263
Um, anyways,

514
00:29:54,620 --> 00:29:56,060
it's d a k. E. R.

515
00:29:56,180 --> 00:29:58,820
If you're just listening now and you
want to fucking watch it at work,

516
00:29:59,300 --> 00:30:01,850
um Oh my God. Listen to
him sing ally Lou. Yeah.

517
00:30:05,110 --> 00:30:05,943
Oh Man.

518
00:30:16,360 --> 00:30:17,193
[inaudible]

519
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,860
okay. A debit for the grace of God.

520
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,980
This fucking guy would be the
most interesting interview

521
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:31,910
ever. Just like [inaudible].

522
00:30:32,230 --> 00:30:34,640
He's one of the most fascinating
people I've ever seen. Like what?

523
00:30:34,710 --> 00:30:37,680
What is going on in between
those fucking ears right now?

524
00:30:38,020 --> 00:30:41,890
[inaudible] if they could, if you could
make a show about his fucking thoughts,

525
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:44,860
you know, all these fucking
movies. Oh, it's, yeah. You know,

526
00:30:44,861 --> 00:30:47,140
they show the movie, but
it's done in reverse.

527
00:30:47,141 --> 00:30:49,630
And then they tried to
fucking flip you out. Nothing.

528
00:30:50,200 --> 00:30:54,100
Nothing pink Floyd could ever fucking
write can match what's going on in this

529
00:30:54,101 --> 00:30:57,520
guy's head. Highly recommended.
All right, let's read 'em.

530
00:30:58,720 --> 00:31:02,940
Let's read some a little bit.
A average size in the, um,

531
00:31:03,010 --> 00:31:06,880
bells will ring. Ring a Ding.
A ding. That's a Maurer.

532
00:31:08,390 --> 00:31:12,550
Um, what the fuck is the God
damn, my name is John Taker.

533
00:31:13,270 --> 00:31:17,000
All right. Oh, Mian d SMI, yon Ds.

534
00:31:17,030 --> 00:31:18,740
No more sweaty taint.

535
00:31:20,380 --> 00:31:22,190
[inaudible] me on d says so dry.

536
00:31:22,191 --> 00:31:26,870
You're gonna Faint and fall into
a puddle Dick fucking first.

537
00:31:26,871 --> 00:31:29,750
But don't fucking worry. Your
underwear will absorb it.

538
00:31:30,230 --> 00:31:34,610
Just like one of those pamper commercials.
Throw it in to the ocean. Oh yeah.

539
00:31:34,690 --> 00:31:37,880
And kill a bunch of fucking dolphins.
All right. Mandy's everybody,

540
00:31:38,930 --> 00:31:41,450
whether you're wearing a suit or sweats,

541
00:31:41,810 --> 00:31:44,930
you spend almost 24 hours
a day in your underwear,

542
00:31:45,290 --> 00:31:48,590
but instead of making a statement like
Superman's tights under his everyday

543
00:31:48,591 --> 00:31:49,760
clothes, your pro,

544
00:31:49,820 --> 00:31:54,170
your underwear is probably boring
beyond his is here to change that.

545
00:31:55,670 --> 00:31:59,710
Uh, every pair of Mandy's is made
from sustainably sourced modal,

546
00:31:59,740 --> 00:32:01,940
modal [inaudible]. I'm going
to keep saying this and t,

547
00:32:01,941 --> 00:32:04,310
tell me which one to accent,

548
00:32:05,230 --> 00:32:10,180
right? It's like a one syllable
word like bike, you know,

549
00:32:10,181 --> 00:32:14,080
bicycle. It's on the sick.
Right? Or is it on the bike?

550
00:32:14,820 --> 00:32:15,780
Oh, fucking know. Anyways,

551
00:32:16,110 --> 00:32:19,320
every pair of Mandy's is made
from sustainably source mortal.

552
00:32:19,770 --> 00:32:22,020
Oh, I heard woo.

553
00:32:22,290 --> 00:32:25,120
Oh, fabric. That's twice as soft
as cotton. I'll tell you right now,

554
00:32:25,630 --> 00:32:28,840
John Draker didn't have on me on
this. Even if he did not even modal,

555
00:32:28,841 --> 00:32:31,900
could fucking absorb the sweat
pouring down his fucking balls.

556
00:32:34,510 --> 00:32:38,160
Nothing can describe the fit the fields
of me undies feel feeling me on this.

557
00:32:38,161 --> 00:32:40,010
I don't want you to try him on.

558
00:32:40,490 --> 00:32:45,420
Yo understand while they are called the
world's most comfortable underwear, uh,

559
00:32:45,560 --> 00:32:46,390
please, if somebody,

560
00:32:46,390 --> 00:32:50,540
the Illuminati probably has boxes made
out of an endangered species, right?

561
00:32:51,380 --> 00:32:56,330
Baby Seal fucking briefs. And if you
don't love your first pair of me on these,

562
00:32:56,360 --> 00:32:58,280
they're free. No questions asked me.

563
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:02,510
And he says dozens of styles and limited
edition prints to help you make a

564
00:33:02,511 --> 00:33:05,450
statement with your underwear.
Some freaks going to collect those,

565
00:33:05,750 --> 00:33:07,340
whether anyone sees them or not.

566
00:33:07,341 --> 00:33:11,120
Remember Superman I'm shipping
is free in the U S and Canada.

567
00:33:11,420 --> 00:33:14,240
And you can save up to $8 a
pair with me undies. What the,

568
00:33:14,480 --> 00:33:16,220
meet the me on these subscription plan.

these other way. All right. Legal Zoom.

critical. When you own a business.

597
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:05,240

00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:20,570

602
00:35:21,380 --> 00:35:25,580
There's more to running your business
than getting static supplier and customer

603
00:35:25,581 --> 00:35:28,970
contracts come with the territory
and if you need to hire help,

604
00:35:29,150 --> 00:35:33,470
each state has its own employment
laws. What a pain in the ass there.

605
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,740
Don't spend valuable time researching
the laws and reading print.

606
00:35:37,770 --> 00:35:39,840
Let legal zoom handle that part.

607
00:35:39,870 --> 00:35:44,870

independent attorneys licensed
in 48 states who know your

608
00:35:45,271 --> 00:35:47,040
local laws and regulations.

for your day to day questions.

610
00:35:50,190 --> 00:35:54,600

hour since legal zoom is in a law firm.

611
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:58,500
Instead, you pay a low monthly fee and
know exactly what you're getting upfront.

612
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:03,600
So go to legalzoom.com today and spend

team of lawyers, I don't know,

618
00:36:23,580 --> 00:36:25,980
fucking zigzagging all over
the track. They're all right.

your mailing and shipping that way for

621
00:36:35,191 --> 00:36:39,600
so long, but think about all the
hassles, man. Dropping what you're doing,

622
00:36:39,601 --> 00:36:42,090
driving there, finding parking, parking,

623
00:36:42,240 --> 00:36:46,470

place by some Weirdo with dyed hair,

All
right,

639
00:37:38,850 --> 00:37:43,110
got it out of the fucking way. Here
we go. Let's get back to the podcast.

640
00:37:44,230 --> 00:37:47,610
Um, all right, let's read some
of the letters for this week.

641
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:51,120
We're going to lead some of the rent.
Oh, before, before I do though, the uh,

642
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:55,950
Jesus Christ, poor Jason
Law head man after game one.

643
00:37:56,670 --> 00:38:00,570
He's a Cleveland Guy after game
one and I can't even say game on.

644
00:38:00,571 --> 00:38:04,260
After the first fucking quarter,
this guy was sending me texts.

645
00:38:04,261 --> 00:38:06,660
He had his like his head in the
oven. I'm like, Jesus Christ, Dude.

646
00:38:06,661 --> 00:38:09,450
Nobody fucking throws in
the towel the way you did.

647
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:11,850
I remember back to back years,

648
00:38:11,851 --> 00:38:16,851
I think in 84 the Lakers came out and
blew out the Celtics in game one and we

649
00:38:17,041 --> 00:38:21,540
came back and beat him and then the very
next year we blew them out and game one

650
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:25,530
one by like 1520 fucking points. And
then the Lakers won. So I was like,

651
00:38:25,531 --> 00:38:29,070
for fuck sakes. The Bruins
were down out to the Vancouver.

652
00:38:29,071 --> 00:38:31,320
We ended up winning for the
next five and we raised,

653
00:38:31,321 --> 00:38:35,380
we fucking hoisted up the cup.
Stop being such a negative Nelly.

654
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:40,660
And then after the game too, when
they lost by like fucking 30 or 35,

655
00:38:40,990 --> 00:38:45,190
I wrote back to him, I maybe
you've got a point. Yeah.

656
00:38:46,750 --> 00:38:51,310
Um, I never say this after two games,
but this series is fucking over.

657
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:56,500
It's over man. Just go, go down. If you
live in Oakland, just go fucking find a,

658
00:38:56,860 --> 00:39:01,380
uh, you know, find a good spot for the
championship parade. This, this is a,

659
00:39:01,990 --> 00:39:05,410
I don't know, maybe they go back
to Cleveland and then, you know,

660
00:39:05,560 --> 00:39:08,100
all the positivity from
their fans seeps into,

661
00:39:10,330 --> 00:39:13,720
I'm kidding. Um, here's a
question I got. If you guys,

662
00:39:13,721 --> 00:39:17,410
I didn't get why Trump got into
so much fucking trouble. You know,

663
00:39:18,730 --> 00:39:20,800
I, we, you know what I
know, cause he's a dope,

664
00:39:20,801 --> 00:39:23,860
but like this stuff that they were
saying that he said something racist,

665
00:39:23,861 --> 00:39:28,720
right about the uh, the judge
Mexican American judge, right?

666
00:39:28,750 --> 00:39:31,690
Something about the fucking
wall. This is what I like to do.

667
00:39:31,750 --> 00:39:33,250
And on a hot button issue like this,

668
00:39:33,251 --> 00:39:35,980
I just gonna Wade right in with
barely ever even knowing the facts.

669
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:40,810
It says Donald Trump's attacks
on the judge, uh, are racist.

670
00:39:40,811 --> 00:39:45,370
He's quite literally saying the judge
can't do his job because of his ethnicity.

671
00:39:45,580 --> 00:39:48,730
This is the definition of racism. I guess.

672
00:39:48,731 --> 00:39:53,230
He was doing some debate going on about
that wall that he wants to build and

673
00:39:53,231 --> 00:39:56,080
this judge who's Mexican
American was going to rule on it.

674
00:39:56,410 --> 00:39:59,830
And I think Trump said that he didn't
want him to because he was Mexican.

675
00:39:59,831 --> 00:40:03,550
He was going to be biased. So
everybody said that that was racist.

676
00:40:03,970 --> 00:40:08,830
So here's my question. As a Joe 12 pack,

677
00:40:09,910 --> 00:40:13,330
I'm not Joe six pack Joe 12 pack. Um,

678
00:40:15,010 --> 00:40:19,750
basically what he did there is far as
I could tell is how they picked juries.

679
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:23,710
Isn't that how they always pick
a jury? You know what I mean?

680
00:40:23,711 --> 00:40:28,630
Like if you go down for jury duty and
the defendant is black as a white dude,

681
00:40:28,631 --> 00:40:31,940
yet the, I'm not, I'm not going to
get picked for this jury or the, the,

682
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:36,910
the defending defendant, uh,
attorney doesn't want me on there.

683
00:40:37,690 --> 00:40:41,440
Right? Isn't that how they picked the
whole old jets? How they always do it?

684
00:40:42,250 --> 00:40:44,320
If it's a domestic violence case,

685
00:40:44,470 --> 00:40:49,360
let's try to get as many women
there as possible. You know,

686
00:40:50,410 --> 00:40:54,760
I think they hide it by go because I
think that they can understand women also

687
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:57,010
now they're hoping to
win the fucking case.

688
00:40:57,070 --> 00:41:02,070
So what they do is they stack the deck
with enough people of the same ilk as the

689
00:41:03,281 --> 00:41:06,700
defendant right now. Don't they
do that? Yeah. My nuts here,

690
00:41:07,960 --> 00:41:09,880
I believe that that's what they do. So

691
00:41:11,490 --> 00:41:16,440
I thought it was kind of ironic that they
within the court system that if Trump

692
00:41:16,441 --> 00:41:17,460
is saying that,

693
00:41:18,180 --> 00:41:22,770
it's like Trump's picking his Gerry to
try to get the fucking wall and what he

694
00:41:22,771 --> 00:41:27,771
wants is he wants a bunch of fucking
white people who like a white guy goes,

695
00:41:28,441 --> 00:41:33,000
oh, we'll [inaudible] you. You, you,
you watch how great it's going to be.

696
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:38,650
He wants the mouth breathing
morons that like him on his jury.

697
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,900
That's all he was saying as
far as I could tell. Right.

698
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:44,350
Not saying the guy's not racist,
but I thought that that one,

699
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:46,210
they were stretching
the bounds a little bit.

700
00:41:46,690 --> 00:41:50,470
Now I'm just asking a fucking question
before you fucking edit this thing and

701
00:41:50,471 --> 00:41:53,080
make me look like the next Hitler.
But I was watching that story.

702
00:41:53,081 --> 00:41:55,870
I was just going like, yeah,
that's kind of how courts work.

703
00:41:56,920 --> 00:41:59,170
It's kind of exactly how it works.

704
00:42:01,390 --> 00:42:04,240
And not to mention when
the OJ verdict came in,

705
00:42:04,390 --> 00:42:08,410
white people like what the fuck and
black people were freaking out having a

706
00:42:08,411 --> 00:42:11,050
parade. That's why they do it. Right?

707
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:15,820
Everybody watches it and you put yourself
in the position of whatever's there.

708
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:20,950
I watched the OJ trial, I'm fucking,
I got my throat slashed. Right?

709
00:42:20,980 --> 00:42:25,750
Black people watch it and they go, yeah,
I got off. That's how I look at it.

710
00:42:25,751 --> 00:42:27,880
I Dunno. And I don't
think that's wrong either.

711
00:42:29,320 --> 00:42:33,920
It's like watching sports except
it's people's freedom. Um, Eddie.

712
00:42:36,150 --> 00:42:39,850
Alright. Scandinavia. Hey
Billy Burger balls. Uh,

713
00:42:39,851 --> 00:42:42,400
is it true that you're not
going to come to Scandinavia?

714
00:42:42,790 --> 00:42:47,590
Me and my lady are huge fans and was
really hoping for you to come to Sweden

715
00:42:47,591 --> 00:42:48,850
this summer. Slash. Fall.

716
00:42:49,150 --> 00:42:52,840
I just need to know if I need to book
some plane tickets to the Netherlands,

717
00:42:53,140 --> 00:42:56,890
then this is going to cost me like
one grand for us to see your shit.

718
00:42:57,220 --> 00:42:59,050
But I'll bet it's worth it. A,

719
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:03,070
but I just need to know if you're planning
to come to Scandinavia some point in

720
00:43:03,071 --> 00:43:03,521
the future.

721
00:43:03,521 --> 00:43:07,270
Otherwise love your shit and looking
forward to F is for family season to,

722
00:43:07,480 --> 00:43:08,930
well thank you very much. Um,

723
00:43:10,330 --> 00:43:15,330
F is for family season two is the reason
why on this trip I'm not going to a

724
00:43:16,890 --> 00:43:21,090
Scandinavia. So like
there's like three chunks.

725
00:43:22,050 --> 00:43:26,790
Okay. There's the my pasty
people, which is coming in first.

726
00:43:27,630 --> 00:43:29,070
You know, just like the jury

727
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:30,570
does this mean I'm a, I'm a,

728
00:43:30,571 --> 00:43:34,450
I'm a racist the way I'm touring
against other white people. Um, no,

729
00:43:34,470 --> 00:43:35,480
it's just how it worked up.

730
00:43:35,670 --> 00:43:39,470
And then I probably would do the
Scandinavian thing next and then

731
00:43:39,560 --> 00:43:43,490
hopefully eastern Europe. That's
what I am hoping to do. Um,

732
00:43:44,850 --> 00:43:47,870
the show takes up way more time than
I thought it would, but like they,

733
00:43:47,871 --> 00:43:52,310
I had a list of 29 cities that wanted
to bring me over there and I could have

734
00:43:52,311 --> 00:43:57,260
gone on a month long
fucking crazy ass tour. Um,

735
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:01,310
uh, broken it up into two. But I
think the way my workload is now,

736
00:44:01,311 --> 00:44:05,330
I have to break it into three, but like
I am absolutely coming back there again.

737
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:09,830
It's a beautiful country.
Um, I love it. You know,

738
00:44:10,390 --> 00:44:13,970
the fuck doesn't want to go that I've
been in like two or three times and uh,

739
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:17,260
I'll definitely come back.
I just don't know when, um,

740
00:44:17,330 --> 00:44:22,130
I can't promise you as to when, but I am
definitely going to come back and, uh,

741
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:26,300
I don't know. Other than that, I
don't have any more information.

742
00:44:26,301 --> 00:44:29,090
So save you money, dude.
Don't blow a grant.

743
00:44:29,750 --> 00:44:32,100
Don't blow grant coming to see
me with Shit and Dick Jokes.

744
00:44:32,480 --> 00:44:35,910
I'll, I'll, I'll come your way. All
right. Don't worry about it. Okay.

745
00:44:36,240 --> 00:44:39,990
Ex men billboard. Hey billion. Um,

746
00:44:40,020 --> 00:44:44,310
this is fucking nerd shit. A nerd
shit. So please bear with me.

747
00:44:44,700 --> 00:44:48,150
There's a new x man
movie and Rose McGowan,

748
00:44:48,180 --> 00:44:53,040
the chick who used to date Marilyn Manson
has their tits in an uproar over this

749
00:44:53,041 --> 00:44:57,480
billboard because between
mystique a woman and apocalypse,

750
00:44:57,560 --> 00:45:01,470
that dude, if you don't want to click
on the link from some Weirdo, you don't,

751
00:45:01,980 --> 00:45:03,450
don't know a no problem.

752
00:45:03,451 --> 00:45:08,430
Just to picture just picture of blue
dude holding up a naked blue woman by the

753
00:45:08,431 --> 00:45:13,050
throat to the point or feet aren't
on the ground. Context. Apocalypse.

754
00:45:13,051 --> 00:45:16,590
The dude is a bad ass villain
in the movie and Mystique.

755
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:21,180
The woman is the leading lady and
Badass heroin in the movie. Um,

756
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:25,500
here's the problem. Rose McGowan says,
this is promoting violence against women,

757
00:45:25,830 --> 00:45:27,930
which I feel is horse shit. Here's why.

758
00:45:28,200 --> 00:45:32,640
If it was Hugh Jackman Slash Wolverine
being choked out and held up,

759
00:45:32,850 --> 00:45:33,690
no problem.

760
00:45:33,900 --> 00:45:37,620
The point of the post is to show how
dangerous slash how much of a threat the

761
00:45:37,980 --> 00:45:41,160
villain, how much of a threat the villain
is. It's not a political statement.

762
00:45:41,730 --> 00:45:43,620
Here's my issue with this though.

763
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:48,480
How does this studio slash movie maker
when Suppose Wolverine was the leading

764
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:51,180
hero? It was a one,

765
00:45:51,210 --> 00:45:56,210
women would be con women
would be complaining that
it's always a man as the hero

766
00:45:56,910 --> 00:46:00,930
and women are more like backup
or support roles. I mean,

767
00:46:01,260 --> 00:46:05,430
Ms Mystique is bad ass. She's
leading the fight against this guy.

768
00:46:05,431 --> 00:46:09,660
To me that's empowering to women.
Uh, she is in a sex symbol.

769
00:46:09,690 --> 00:46:13,020
In the movie though, Jennifer Lawrence,
who plays her is really attractive.

770
00:46:13,021 --> 00:46:14,490
She's just strong and a leader.

771
00:46:15,090 --> 00:46:19,860
All I can think is that they
wanted her standing all,

772
00:46:20,350 --> 00:46:24,060
all I can think is that they want her
standing on the neck of the villain.

773
00:46:24,390 --> 00:46:27,630
But this, but that's fucking
stupid. For promotional posters.

774
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:33,570
You couldn't have her be the villain
and holding up a man hero because that

775
00:46:33,571 --> 00:46:37,950
would be some kind of anti woman. All
women are evil campaign instead. Right.

776
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:38,873
Where you lost me here,

777
00:46:39,210 --> 00:46:44,160
you couldn't have her be the villain
and holding up a man hero. Oh,

778
00:46:44,161 --> 00:46:44,981
I see. If she, if,

779
00:46:44,981 --> 00:46:49,440
if the female character was evil and
there was holding up the guy character,

780
00:46:50,160 --> 00:46:52,500
they couldn't do that because
then they would be saying, oh,

781
00:46:52,550 --> 00:46:56,280
if we antique be considered
anti-women all women are evil. Um,

782
00:46:56,281 --> 00:47:00,930
I guess what bothers me is that it just
seems like there's no way to please any

783
00:47:00,931 --> 00:47:05,910
non white male. Lately, uh, women wanted
a strong female hero that got one,

784
00:47:06,120 --> 00:47:08,580
but she's in danger of the villain. A man,

785
00:47:08,700 --> 00:47:12,810
somehow that equals violence on women
when it's really just about violence in

786
00:47:12,811 --> 00:47:15,570
general or war or conflict
or whatever. I mean,

787
00:47:15,571 --> 00:47:18,750
the dude isn't slapping her
for over cooking his steak.

788
00:47:21,420 --> 00:47:24,000
He's trying to conquer the
world. She's trying to stop,

789
00:47:24,030 --> 00:47:28,080
stop him and he's choking her ass.
How, how is that a gender issue?

790
00:47:29,830 --> 00:47:34,420
Um, all right. Uh, let me see. Let me
see. If I can find the picture this year,

791
00:47:35,830 --> 00:47:37,930
I did look at it, uh,

792
00:47:39,330 --> 00:47:43,510
[inaudible] library. No, that's not
the f I always click on the wrong one.

793
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:45,053
Okay.

794
00:47:45,500 --> 00:47:48,500
Yeah. I actually, you know, when I
heard it, I thought it was bull shit,

795
00:47:48,501 --> 00:47:52,130
but then I saw the poster,
the, the movie clip that I saw.

796
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:56,410
I don't see your feet
dangling off of it. Um, I,

797
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:59,780
I see why they did that. I understand
why that they did it that way.

798
00:48:00,830 --> 00:48:02,080
What happens is when you're writing,

799
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:05,360
what I'm learning is when you're writing
something you're so fucking focused on

800
00:48:05,361 --> 00:48:10,361
is the story tracking from point a to
point B to point c and we land this thing

801
00:48:10,941 --> 00:48:13,870
without crashing into
the fucking ocean. Um,

802
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:18,620
that they wouldn't think that anybody,
you know, might have a problem with that.

803
00:48:19,700 --> 00:48:21,320
Um, I understand, I understand. I,

804
00:48:21,321 --> 00:48:24,020
this is actually one of those ones I
get why they don't want to see that,

805
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:27,800
but in defensive view, if, how about this?

806
00:48:27,801 --> 00:48:32,240
If the guy character, the, the fucking
Apollo Guy, whatever his fucking name is,

807
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:36,740
was a apocalypse, such dumb names,

808
00:48:36,741 --> 00:48:40,970
apocalypse mystique, this
all sound like bad cologne.

809
00:48:42,120 --> 00:48:42,953
Um,

810
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,123
okay.

811
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,360
Um, anyways, if, if
apocalypse was holding a,

812
00:48:50,361 --> 00:48:53,120
the Wolverine Hugh Jackman
by the throat, now,

813
00:48:53,121 --> 00:48:57,020
would that be promoting
male on male violence?

814
00:48:57,021 --> 00:49:00,410
Would that be more a barroom
brawls because of that?

815
00:49:01,520 --> 00:49:06,080
I honestly don't think
it promotes violence.

816
00:49:06,081 --> 00:49:07,340
I think, um,

817
00:49:08,510 --> 00:49:13,510
like the levels stupid that you'd have
to be to look at apocalypse holding up,

818
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:19,970
pulled in a woman by her
throat and to say like, oh,

819
00:49:19,971 --> 00:49:22,640
I guess it's okay to hit women. Now
I'm going to start hitting women.

820
00:49:22,790 --> 00:49:26,180
If you were that fucking stupid,
by the time you got to you,

821
00:49:26,181 --> 00:49:27,740
unless she was riding
in the car, let's see,

822
00:49:27,880 --> 00:49:31,220
you're driving home and now you're going
to fucking choker because you saw this

823
00:49:31,250 --> 00:49:35,460
apocalypse guy choking a fucking, um,

824
00:49:36,350 --> 00:49:38,330
mystique, right?

825
00:49:38,870 --> 00:49:42,650
You'd also see another thousand signs
on the way home and next thing you know,

826
00:49:42,651 --> 00:49:46,010
I dunno, you'd be in a car
dealership buying something or, uh,

827
00:49:46,040 --> 00:49:49,760
getting a fucking McDonald's sandwich.
I think you would forget you with that.

828
00:49:49,761 --> 00:49:53,420
Like, if your brain was
like that, uh, influenced,

829
00:49:53,870 --> 00:49:58,640
but having said that, I looking at
the, um, the poster and I don't,

830
00:49:58,760 --> 00:50:01,640
I understand why they would just
like, you know, that's not the, uh,

831
00:50:01,660 --> 00:50:06,260
greatest image. You could have
another image up there. Yeah.

832
00:50:06,261 --> 00:50:09,110
I don't have a problem with them changing
it, but I definitely understand your,

833
00:50:09,530 --> 00:50:14,410
um, your points on that thing. But,
uh, you know, I don't, I don't,

834
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:19,470
I don't fucking know. It's, it's
just the time that we're living in.

835
00:50:19,500 --> 00:50:22,470
Everybody gets offended.
Everybody doesn't get offended.

836
00:50:22,471 --> 00:50:27,000
A small group of people gets
offended. And, um, the news covers,

837
00:50:27,980 --> 00:50:31,340
you know, because what are they
gonna talk about the fucking,

838
00:50:31,460 --> 00:50:36,080
now the drug companies in a roundabout
way killed prince, you know,

839
00:50:36,410 --> 00:50:39,200
I mean, what are they
gonna talk about it again?

840
00:50:39,201 --> 00:50:42,920
Talk about fracking and people
than fucking up the water supply.

841
00:50:43,100 --> 00:50:46,130
Then there's too much money involved
in that. Okay. But you know,

842
00:50:46,131 --> 00:50:50,360
if you've got a group of fucking soccer
moms upset about a fucking blue woman

843
00:50:50,361 --> 00:50:54,650
getting held up by a guy who appears to
be made out of stone, I'm in a movie,

844
00:50:54,920 --> 00:50:57,050
you know, that's gonna make
it. It's gonna make it,

845
00:50:57,051 --> 00:50:59,690
you do a Caitlin Jenner joke
in a fucking strip mall. Yeah,

846
00:50:59,691 --> 00:51:03,830
that's going to get on the fucking
news. But real shit that matters. Nah,

847
00:51:03,860 --> 00:51:07,790
that's not gonna happen. You know,
that's not going to fall. Why? Why now?

848
00:51:09,170 --> 00:51:10,003
Why would you do that?

849
00:51:10,010 --> 00:51:13,340
That's just another one of
those backburner stories
that they just stick on the

850
00:51:13,341 --> 00:51:16,910
front burner all the fucking time.
Like they, I mean, I'm not saying like,

851
00:51:16,911 --> 00:51:20,360
you know, violence against women isn't
a major issue, but I'm just saying like,

852
00:51:20,361 --> 00:51:23,240
people aren't as simplistic as that.

853
00:51:23,241 --> 00:51:25,520
Like they don't fucking
look at something and like,

854
00:51:27,280 --> 00:51:28,113
um,

855
00:51:28,730 --> 00:51:29,720
I dunno as a kid,

856
00:51:29,721 --> 00:51:32,240
like the amount of violence that
I watched when I was growing up,

857
00:51:33,890 --> 00:51:37,610
you know what I mean? All the
fucking shows that I've watched,

858
00:51:37,611 --> 00:51:41,060
I've yet to chase somebody down an
alley, pull them off a fence, chain link,

859
00:51:41,061 --> 00:51:44,840
fence, beat them up. Or even
slide over the hood of a car.

860
00:51:44,870 --> 00:51:47,090
I saw all those images
when I was growing up.

861
00:51:47,330 --> 00:51:49,850
I used to pretend and play
war and all that shit.

862
00:51:49,851 --> 00:51:53,270
I never fucking killed anybody. I've never
hit a woman. I never did any of that.

863
00:51:53,271 --> 00:51:54,560
I think what, you know, what it is,

864
00:51:54,620 --> 00:51:59,090
is what really makes you do shit like
that is his horrific fucking parents.

865
00:52:00,560 --> 00:52:03,110
I think that that's what it is. And
now they're trying to blame the signs,

866
00:52:03,140 --> 00:52:06,320
the sign that's going to be up for all
of fucking two weeks when this movie's

867
00:52:06,321 --> 00:52:06,650
out,

868
00:52:06,650 --> 00:52:10,490
as opposed to your dad and mom and their
relationship that you grow up for the

869
00:52:10,491 --> 00:52:14,240
first 18 years of your life.
Fucking watch it. But you know,

870
00:52:14,270 --> 00:52:18,170
you can't blame those people because
those people buy things on the channel.

871
00:52:19,040 --> 00:52:19,641
You know what I mean?

872
00:52:19,641 --> 00:52:22,910
So you always give them a pass and then
you rub their balls and you call them

873
00:52:22,911 --> 00:52:27,290
Joe six back in fucking, uh,
the true heroes. You know,

874
00:52:27,320 --> 00:52:30,170
they're always rubbing their balls like
they give a fuck about them. They don't,

875
00:52:30,171 --> 00:52:31,730
they just want their money.
You know what I mean?

876
00:52:31,910 --> 00:52:36,860
That's why corporations act like all of
these non crisis is our absolute crisis

877
00:52:37,190 --> 00:52:40,370
crisis disease, because they
don't want to lose a fucking dime.

878
00:52:40,940 --> 00:52:44,900
So if anybody bitches, anybody mounds,
anybody complains, they fucking cave in.

879
00:52:45,320 --> 00:52:49,130
And then a lot of these groups are
aware of that. And when they get to a,

880
00:52:49,340 --> 00:52:52,560
to get a corporation to
cave, it gives them like it,

881
00:52:52,730 --> 00:52:55,900
it's almost like a video game.
It gives them more life and a,

882
00:52:56,100 --> 00:53:00,650
they're taken more seriously. So it's
a giant, it's a giant fucking game.

883
00:53:01,690 --> 00:53:02,990
You know, at the end
of the day it's, it's,

884
00:53:02,991 --> 00:53:06,020
it's two people that
don't fucking exist. But

885
00:53:06,770 --> 00:53:07,603
um,

886
00:53:08,240 --> 00:53:10,820
I dunno, there's something,
there's a look on her face.

887
00:53:10,821 --> 00:53:12,170
She doesn't look bad ass there.

888
00:53:12,860 --> 00:53:14,930
It makes me feel bad for
her and I want to help her.

889
00:53:15,800 --> 00:53:18,800
So maybe what they should have done,

890
00:53:18,950 --> 00:53:23,810
she should've had a more fucking Rhonda
Rousey look on her face and maybe it was

891
00:53:23,811 --> 00:53:26,310
pulling backs on his
fucking, are those cornrows?

892
00:53:26,310 --> 00:53:29,160
What the fuck does he have?
Or is that wavy hair? I can't,

893
00:53:29,220 --> 00:53:33,510
I don't know what this guy made
out of his fucking claymation hair.

894
00:53:33,540 --> 00:53:35,040
She should have. She
should be like, you know,

895
00:53:35,041 --> 00:53:38,970
maybe gouge in his eyes a little
bit. I don't know. I was kidding who.

896
00:53:38,971 --> 00:53:40,000
They'd still fucking complain.

897
00:53:41,570 --> 00:53:42,403
Um,

898
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:47,750
if you really want to get them going,
just have that picture right there.

899
00:53:47,751 --> 00:53:48,860
That image. Nah,

900
00:53:48,870 --> 00:53:53,180
I'm not going to tell you to do that
because there's no sense of humor anymore.

901
00:53:53,181 --> 00:53:56,330
I was gonna I was going to say that maybe
you could take that image and say like

902
00:53:56,330 --> 00:53:59,620
, um, no, don't built down it's,

903
00:53:59,950 --> 00:54:03,370
it's don't ask me in a show. I'll tell
you what I was going to say. All right.

904
00:54:03,640 --> 00:54:06,520
Hey, Billy dope, Philly, the fucking dope.

905
00:54:07,220 --> 00:54:11,440
Can't can women forget Mr.
Nice Guy Persona. Uh, Hey,

906
00:54:11,500 --> 00:54:15,580
I'm really having a difficult reading
today. All right, big fan from Lithuania.

907
00:54:15,640 --> 00:54:19,300
That's another one on the list that I
gotta get to. Uh, you're a great comedian.

908
00:54:19,301 --> 00:54:22,600
It would be great if he ever decided to
do your stand up here in the Baltics.

909
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:25,270
Um, that will happen at
some point in my career.

910
00:54:25,630 --> 00:54:28,390
Hopefully sooner rather than
later. All right. The guy says,

911
00:54:28,391 --> 00:54:33,130
I got at this dilemma. Can a woman
forget your past as a nice guy?

912
00:54:33,970 --> 00:54:38,970
One of my former classmates is coming
back to my hometown on summer vacation for

913
00:54:39,311 --> 00:54:44,230
a few weeks and let's say I'd like to
get intimate with her while she's here.

914
00:54:44,470 --> 00:54:47,080
Now the thing is, when
we were still in school,

915
00:54:47,320 --> 00:54:50,470
I had a mad crush on this
girl for years. However,

916
00:54:50,530 --> 00:54:53,890
Shit didn't work out because I
didn't know how the life works,

917
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:59,650
how the females work. And also I
was a little bitch, Mister Nice guy.

918
00:55:01,350 --> 00:55:02,000
Uh,

919
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:04,690
I beat my younger self. That
was possible. All right.

920
00:55:05,010 --> 00:55:09,890
[inaudible] you're doing some good therapy
here. Uh, but for over the years, uh,

921
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:13,040
but over the years that I've
spent in our capital city city,

922
00:55:13,041 --> 00:55:17,320
I can safely say that my view and
attitude towards females and masculinity,

923
00:55:17,510 --> 00:55:20,720
Lee masculinity has changed
significantly. What do you think?

924
00:55:20,721 --> 00:55:25,430
Can a woman brush off the image of a nice
guy or are you forever marked with the

925
00:55:25,431 --> 00:55:29,180
certain character traits in her eyes? Um,

926
00:55:30,290 --> 00:55:32,720
yeah, I think you're,
you're kind of fucked.

927
00:55:34,460 --> 00:55:35,510
Just put it this way.

928
00:55:35,540 --> 00:55:40,540
Like take like the actor that played
like Urkel or something like that.

929
00:55:42,590 --> 00:55:45,440
It's like you're typecast, you know,

930
00:55:46,760 --> 00:55:50,780
and Urkel could literally become an
army fucking ranger and then leave the

931
00:55:50,781 --> 00:55:54,860
military. And when he went to
go do a fucking action movie,

932
00:55:55,160 --> 00:55:58,700
they allow fucking article.
Give me a fucking break. Right.

933
00:55:58,850 --> 00:56:03,230
It's just the problem is
what you got to do. Look,

934
00:56:03,260 --> 00:56:05,570
you always got to take you
go, he's gotta take it.

935
00:56:05,990 --> 00:56:10,150
Bet what you're going to have to
do when you get up there. He says,

936
00:56:10,170 --> 00:56:14,570
you're going to have to crowd the
plate. No Kid, which I would just be,

937
00:56:15,050 --> 00:56:20,050
you're gonna have to be significantly
different to raise any sort of intrigue in

938
00:56:20,661 --> 00:56:24,910
her. You know what I mean? Cause
probably just wants to meet up with you,

939
00:56:25,240 --> 00:56:27,820
you know, have a couple of
ciders or whatever that,

940
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:29,860
whatever those drinks women have,

941
00:56:29,861 --> 00:56:31,810
when they know that they're not
going to fuck you. You know,

942
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:34,930
one of those fucking, I
want to feel warm. You know,

943
00:56:34,931 --> 00:56:37,930
they have that stupid sweater that covers
their hands too and they drink it with

944
00:56:37,931 --> 00:56:41,500
both hands out of a Mug, you know?
And it's just fucking over, right.

945
00:56:41,830 --> 00:56:44,610
They're like, you know, hitting more
on the waiter than the, I don't,

946
00:56:44,611 --> 00:56:47,380
I mean listen to you. You're
going to have to lie. I Dunno.

947
00:56:48,940 --> 00:56:49,990
I don't know what you gotta do.

948
00:56:50,020 --> 00:56:52,840
Go Buy yourself a Raiders of
the lost Ark Leather jacket.

949
00:56:52,990 --> 00:56:56,950
You got to try to come in and act
like you've been fucking doing this.

950
00:56:56,960 --> 00:56:57,793
This is the thing.

951
00:56:58,750 --> 00:57:03,610
This is what's gonna fuck you is you
want this woman to bad. All right?

952
00:57:04,210 --> 00:57:08,500
You got to not give a fuck.
Don't be, don't be a deck.

953
00:57:08,501 --> 00:57:10,930
But just go in there and just,
hey, what's going on? What?

954
00:57:10,931 --> 00:57:15,670
Even up to now and then talk up some
of the shit you're doing. You know?

955
00:57:16,360 --> 00:57:19,510
I don't know. Look at your phone out
his bride. She's driving me crazy.

956
00:57:19,511 --> 00:57:22,390
I got the ladies all over me. I
don't know. I don't know dude.

957
00:57:22,480 --> 00:57:25,750
I don't know what to tell you on
this one. Once you're typecast,

958
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,690
it's fucking over, dude. You got
to go behind the camera here.

959
00:57:30,350 --> 00:57:33,100
You got to start directing or some shit
cause I don't know what to tell you.

960
00:57:33,430 --> 00:57:38,080
Your, um, this is what I would
do. Just know this going into it,

961
00:57:38,290 --> 00:57:42,550
you're fucked. All right. So there's
no pressure. Who gives a shit?

962
00:57:43,810 --> 00:57:46,270
And uh, I don't know. Make her
laugh and just tell her, you know,

963
00:57:46,271 --> 00:57:48,250
I always had a crush on you,
but I used to be a bitch,

964
00:57:48,251 --> 00:57:51,940
but I'm not a bitch anymore. So
what do you say? What do you say?

965
00:57:51,941 --> 00:57:56,080
You come over here and uh, jump on my
fucking enough. He can't go that way,

966
00:57:56,081 --> 00:58:00,610
but I, yeah, I would, I'm man, man,

967
00:58:00,611 --> 00:58:04,510
that's a tough one. That's a tough
one. I, I, you know, maybe that's it.

968
00:58:04,511 --> 00:58:08,290
Just trash your former self. Yeah. Used
to be. It used to be a pitch, you know,

969
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:10,660
I don't know how to do
it, dude. You know what?

970
00:58:10,790 --> 00:58:13,750
You'd get stumped me
somewhere in there, I think.

971
00:58:13,751 --> 00:58:18,520
I think the whole not giving a fuck and
then trashing your former self and then

972
00:58:18,521 --> 00:58:21,820
just telling her that you had a crush
on her. Who knows? Dude, maybe. Uh,

973
00:58:22,990 --> 00:58:27,600
I dunno. There's a chance. Maybe
she likes you back then or, I dunno.

974
00:58:27,610 --> 00:58:31,650
Women got that thing though, Dude. Once
you're the fucking friend, it, you're,

975
00:58:31,930 --> 00:58:36,130
you're, you're, it's over.
Dude. So you're fucking, um,

976
00:58:37,210 --> 00:58:40,330
oh, the lovely Nia Nia.
You know, we need you,

977
00:58:42,580 --> 00:58:47,100
me and this guy from Lithuania. I'll
tell you really quickly, grab up,

978
00:58:47,180 --> 00:58:51,970
grab one of those chords.
All right. Jesus. All right.

979
00:58:52,000 --> 00:58:56,020
As you're plugging in, I'll tell you
this guy basically in Lithuania, he, uh,

980
00:58:56,950 --> 00:59:01,550
he used to be a bitch when it
used to be Mr. Nice guy. So he,

981
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,780
he didn't get any of any of the nice,
nicest Tracy Morgan would say. Right.

982
00:59:05,500 --> 00:59:08,020
So he, um,

983
00:59:09,940 --> 00:59:11,770
whatever he had a crush on
this chicken she got put in.

984
00:59:11,771 --> 00:59:13,360
The friend zone is Chris Rock would say,

985
00:59:13,390 --> 00:59:17,050
I'm just going to quote every
black comedian here and um,

986
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:22,220
you plugged in. There we go. And

987
00:59:22,220 --> 00:59:26,090
you're putting the windscreen on eh,

988
00:59:26,320 --> 00:59:31,320
really loud and annoying to the
listeners. There we go. The lovely Nia.

989
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:35,370
Everybody. Hi. Yeah. So basically
he had a crush on this girl.

990
00:59:35,371 --> 00:59:36,181
He was a nice guy.

991
00:59:36,181 --> 00:59:39,150
He got put in the friend zone and
now she's coming back to town.

992
00:59:39,420 --> 00:59:43,740
He's now lived in the city. He understands
the male female dynamic better.

993
00:59:44,100 --> 00:59:48,900
Okay. And, um, the way he's wearing this,
he's been doing all right for himself,

994
00:59:49,500 --> 00:59:51,590
but he still wants to
bang this woman. He's, he,

995
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:56,600
his question is once you're in the
friend zone like that [inaudible] okay.

996
00:59:57,861 --> 01:00:02,130
Is it possible to get out of it?
Absolutely. It is. Oh Wow. Okay.

997
01:00:02,280 --> 01:00:04,210
Cause I was going like, I don't
know, I was saying to you like, type,

998
01:00:04,340 --> 01:00:07,080
you're like Urkel and now you want
to be the star of an action movie,

999
01:00:07,200 --> 01:00:11,160
you know? But yeah, no, I
think you can, but it's all,

1000
01:00:11,161 --> 01:00:13,290
it's all predicated on your behavior.

1001
01:00:13,530 --> 01:00:15,240
Like you don't want gotta
all of a sudden start at

1002
01:00:15,320 --> 01:00:18,010
do you like an aloof, a
jerk or anything like that.

1003
01:00:18,011 --> 01:00:21,880
So I told them by a rate as a lost
dark waste link, leather jacket,

1004
01:00:22,280 --> 01:00:25,460
maybe get it hat and a whip. Oh yeah.

1005
01:00:26,690 --> 01:00:29,250
Is that bad? Uh, I just,

1006
01:00:29,290 --> 01:00:33,820
I think maybe you're a little
less available perhaps.

1007
01:00:34,180 --> 01:00:38,980
You know, you know, it can be a thing
where she'll come to town and be like,

1008
01:00:38,981 --> 01:00:41,620
oh my God, I guess let's go here and
Dah, Dah, Dah, and I want to do this.

1009
01:00:41,621 --> 01:00:44,020
And then, you know. Oh yeah,
yeah, definitely. Well, we'll,

1010
01:00:44,021 --> 01:00:45,400
we'll let me know when
you're around. Yeah.

1011
01:00:45,401 --> 01:00:49,550
Maybe we can grab a drink or
something. Gave a cash and um,

1012
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:54,010
don't go in there like, so I've
been fucking a lot of broads. Yeah.

1013
01:00:54,130 --> 01:00:56,510
It's not like that,

1014
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:01,170
but just as she's talking about her
life, you talk about your life. Yeah.

1015
01:01:01,171 --> 01:01:01,830
I've been seeing

1016
01:01:01,830 --> 01:01:04,130
girls here and there. I don't
know nothing too serious,

1017
01:01:04,131 --> 01:01:07,160
but I've been having my fun. But
anyway, what's going on with you?

1018
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:09,200
You look good like that. Like

1019
01:01:10,030 --> 01:01:14,710
Nia, Bam. That was good.
Oh, were you, were you,

1020
01:01:14,800 --> 01:01:18,400
were you enjoying that just then that
little ah, interact. I am joining the,

1021
01:01:18,401 --> 01:01:22,960
the the advice. Yeah, that was good.
That was usually, I was stammering.

1022
01:01:22,961 --> 01:01:26,830
I was like, uh, maybe I have
to just fuck it. I said,

1023
01:01:26,831 --> 01:01:29,060
your best thing you got going
is, you know you've got no shot,

1024
01:01:29,061 --> 01:01:32,890
so just don't give a fuck it,
just go in there and just be like,

1025
01:01:33,100 --> 01:01:34,200
I sold shoes.

1026
01:01:34,700 --> 01:01:39,140
You have to not get, you can't go
into it with expectations of anything.

1027
01:01:39,810 --> 01:01:43,160
Yeah. I think you just be normal.

1028
01:01:43,161 --> 01:01:45,110
Be a friend like you have been,

1029
01:01:45,111 --> 01:01:49,110
but I think I have a friend who
often gets friends zoned it,

1030
01:01:49,111 --> 01:01:54,111
and I'm always telling him that he needs
to make himself less available because

1031
01:01:54,530 --> 01:01:56,210
he always makes himself available

1032
01:01:56,270 --> 01:02:00,830
psychologically to women when the less
available as I have a theory and I know

1033
01:02:00,930 --> 01:02:03,220
it'll be considered sexist,
so I'll listen to you. Or just

1034
01:02:03,480 --> 01:02:05,990
the same with men and women.
If you're less available,

1035
01:02:05,991 --> 01:02:10,730
like the PE people want you more.
And I think that's just how life is.

1036
01:02:10,760 --> 01:02:14,660
People like the hunt. I think
men like the hunt a little more.

1037
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:16,640
So I think you should
remember like the hunt

1038
01:02:17,350 --> 01:02:20,400
really. If someone's like a pain, be
like, oh hey. And I'd be like, yeah,

1039
01:02:20,660 --> 01:02:23,190
I'm not a hunter. I
have four of it. Gather.

1040
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:31,110
No, I was just more like, I hate,

1041
01:02:31,340 --> 01:02:35,100
hated when women played hard to get. It
was so funny. It just, it got so boring,

1042
01:02:35,101 --> 01:02:39,510
so fucking fast. I was just like, Hey,
I can fucking, I'll just go rub one out

1043
01:02:41,120 --> 01:02:44,190
and then I'll go watch a game and then
you know something. Then I act. It's,

1044
01:02:44,670 --> 01:02:48,000
you're not worth the fucking
trouble. Right. You know what I mean?

1045
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:50,760
I just always found that like, um,

1046
01:02:51,600 --> 01:02:54,090
cause I remember when I would just start
to walk away and let these girls would

1047
01:02:54,091 --> 01:02:57,900
be like, no, you're supposed to blah,
blah, blah, blah, blah. I was like, oh,

1048
01:02:57,901 --> 01:02:58,261
I didn't,

1049
01:02:58,261 --> 01:03:02,340
I didn't get the script to where my in
like some fucking awful play right now.

1050
01:03:02,490 --> 01:03:03,323
Right.

1051
01:03:04,890 --> 01:03:07,710
I walked away from a lot by my number
could have been so much higher.

1052
01:03:09,090 --> 01:03:12,690
I should've chased. I didn't chase, I
just tapped out. I'd be like, ah, yeah.

1053
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,940
You know, if you don't want
to, I understand. You know,

1054
01:03:15,030 --> 01:03:18,840
I wouldn't fuck me either.
Oh, all right. Oh No,

1055
01:03:18,841 --> 01:03:23,190
don't say that about yourself.
People like you. All right.

1056
01:03:23,910 --> 01:03:28,650
A bill dill pickle. Um, I love a
good sandwich. My question to you is,

1057
01:03:28,890 --> 01:03:32,190
if you are a sandwich, what
type of sandwich would you be?

1058
01:03:32,191 --> 01:03:33,660
I think you already answered this one.

1059
01:03:35,110 --> 01:03:38,490
If you could eat only one sandwich for
the rest of your life, what would you be?

1060
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:43,440
All right, Nia. Remind the listeners
what kind of sandwich you think I am.

1061
01:03:45,060 --> 01:03:48,390
I once compared you to a
grilled cheese sandwich.

1062
01:03:48,780 --> 01:03:52,200
But the thing about it said you were
about as exotic is a grilled cheese

1063
01:03:52,201 --> 01:03:56,610
sandwich. I was talking about
that. If, if I ever went to prison,

1064
01:03:56,760 --> 01:04:01,020
yes. The fact that I was a red head
on for the first time in my life,

1065
01:04:01,021 --> 01:04:02,830
I might be considered exotic. Yeah.

1066
01:04:03,030 --> 01:04:06,030
And I thought you were
grossly overestimating.

1067
01:04:06,090 --> 01:04:10,890
I was joking about the fact that quickly
I would be sexually assaulted in there.

1068
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:14,160
And you had to remind me
that I'm a plain Jane.

1069
01:04:14,850 --> 01:04:17,660
There wasn't even tomatoes on that
fucking grilled cheese sandwich.

1070
01:04:17,790 --> 01:04:20,040
You think what? The hair? I
would got something. Fuck.

1071
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,830
Alright, so sandwich. Would you
like to eat for the rest of the,

1072
01:04:25,831 --> 01:04:27,750
I know the sandwich that I could.

1073
01:04:27,890 --> 01:04:31,880
This sounded like this question
came out of cosmo. He went to Tham,

1074
01:04:31,881 --> 01:04:33,400
which were kind of thing.
Which would you be,

1075
01:04:33,450 --> 01:04:36,660
and if you could only eat one
sandwich for the rest of your life,

1076
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:37,740
what would it be?

1077
01:04:37,950 --> 01:04:40,620
We would never ask each other what
kind of sandwich we'd want to be.

1078
01:04:41,330 --> 01:04:44,910
Maybe like what kind of dress are
you? A classic little black dress.

1079
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:50,470
The cocktail dress. Oh,
for the Oscars like that.

1080
01:04:51,260 --> 01:04:53,110
But what about for the bigger girls? Well,

1081
01:04:53,370 --> 01:04:55,950
for the bigger girls where
they see the bigger girls,

1082
01:04:56,280 --> 01:05:01,260
or you were car cover with Spaghetti
straps stop. Why didn't they call?

1083
01:05:01,261 --> 01:05:03,990
They're just feeding your fucking egos.
Like you're all these PR. Oh yeah.

1084
01:05:04,110 --> 01:05:08,850
When I want, I get what they're doing.
They're trying to sell magazines anyway.

1085
01:05:08,851 --> 01:05:11,730
What kind of sandwich
would you be? Velveeta.

1086
01:05:13,350 --> 01:05:15,780
If I was a pair of pants,
I'd be clam diggers.

1087
01:05:19,630 --> 01:05:23,980
I saw like four or five guys
wearing those fucking things. Oh,

1088
01:05:23,981 --> 01:05:26,620
this weekend? Yeah. Like those guys.

1089
01:05:26,621 --> 01:05:29,650
We have the Hitler youth haircuts and
then they just walk around with the cubes

1090
01:05:29,651 --> 01:05:32,860
up the fucking airport.

1091
01:05:34,420 --> 01:05:36,040
It's the funniest thing ever.

1092
01:05:36,520 --> 01:05:40,030
I don't know why it's not so CIF sackful
just pointed their legs and start

1093
01:05:40,031 --> 01:05:43,900
laughing. It's just me. All right.
I love a good sandwich too. Okay.

1094
01:05:45,460 --> 01:05:48,640
Um, oh. And I be, uh, I don't
know. My freckles and all that.

1095
01:05:48,720 --> 01:05:49,900
I'd probably be a lobster roll.

1096
01:05:51,920 --> 01:05:54,960
Lobster or crab roll? No,

1097
01:05:55,120 --> 01:05:57,670
you're looking all fucking
white with red blotches

1098
01:06:00,520 --> 01:06:04,450
in a day old bun. That'd be my
sciatic nerve problem. I'm a mess.

1099
01:06:05,240 --> 01:06:06,940
It's too like there are
certain white people,

1100
01:06:06,941 --> 01:06:10,810
they definitely take on the hue of a
boiled lobster when they had to my son.

1101
01:06:11,200 --> 01:06:14,340
And that would be me. Um, if you, okay.

1102
01:06:14,690 --> 01:06:18,670
Turkey sandwich cause you like Turkey
sandwiches. Yeah. But that's not me.

1103
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,450
You're not no Turkey sandwich. You know,

1104
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:25,180
people get excited and happy when Turkey
comes around. You know what I mean?

1105
01:06:25,260 --> 01:06:27,230
I think you're a Turkey sandwich
cause you're like, what?

1106
01:06:27,270 --> 01:06:31,300
You don't ever say that again? I think
you're a Turkey citizen. You're reliable.

1107
01:06:31,301 --> 01:06:34,630
You're satisfied. And when I
talk I make it go to sleep.

1108
01:06:35,840 --> 01:06:39,640
When consumed, I make you sleepy. All
right. If you could only eat one sandwich,

1109
01:06:39,970 --> 01:06:42,460
Nia, for the rest of your
life, what would it be?

1110
01:06:42,461 --> 01:06:46,240
This feels like a lifetime movie. Is a
Philly cheese day considered a sandwich?

1111
01:06:46,930 --> 01:06:49,450
Cause you know, that's my all
time favorite of all time.

1112
01:06:49,480 --> 01:06:53,980
Well I mean it's not
considered breakfast. No,

1113
01:06:53,981 --> 01:06:57,290
it's considered a cereal. All right.
So yeah, I feel like a cheese stick.

1114
01:06:57,850 --> 01:07:00,370
I don't remember. Yeah,
hero is a sandwich. Right?

1115
01:07:00,700 --> 01:07:05,530
Or whatever the fuck they call a
hero sandwich. So yeah. One Sandwich.

1116
01:07:05,540 --> 01:07:10,410
Rest of my life, I'd eat a peanut butter
sandwich with butter. PBB and Jay.

1117
01:07:10,680 --> 01:07:13,030
Yeah, that's what I would have with
a glass of fucking milk weight.

1118
01:07:13,180 --> 01:07:16,540
You'd have jelly on it though. What
do you know? I don't wanna get fat.

1119
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,710
You put Jelly on your fucking with
you. If I could have one once,

1120
01:07:20,900 --> 01:07:24,040
just one for the rest of my fucking
life. I don't have to eat it every day.

1121
01:07:25,430 --> 01:07:27,220
Well, no, not every day,

1122
01:07:27,221 --> 01:07:30,550
but the only sandwich when you're
in the mood for a sandwich,

1123
01:07:30,551 --> 01:07:32,500
you can only eat this particular sandwich.

1124
01:07:35,290 --> 01:07:38,800
I Dunno. An Italian sub.
You like Italian sandwiches.

1125
01:07:39,030 --> 01:07:41,710
Then they put the oil all over and
it feels like the bread sweaty.

1126
01:07:42,130 --> 01:07:43,450
You don't always have to get the oil.

1127
01:07:46,720 --> 01:07:49,240
I don't know what I'd have. I don't, I
don't know what I would fucking have.

1128
01:07:49,270 --> 01:07:52,570
It is just to my not, I guess if
I wouldn't die of a heart attack,

1129
01:07:53,170 --> 01:07:57,100
I'd have a roast beef sandwich.
Here you go. There you go, Bill.

1130
01:07:57,101 --> 01:08:01,760
You're exciting. All right,
lady likes the belly. Uh,

1131
01:08:02,410 --> 01:08:04,390
Billy, you bastard, love the podcast.

1132
01:08:06,250 --> 01:08:10,030
It's just funny you passed
it. Love the podcast mate. Um,

1133
01:08:10,090 --> 01:08:13,060
have been following your
shenanigans for nearly eight years,

1134
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:14,980
hustling for tickets when
you get here to London.

1135
01:08:15,720 --> 01:08:19,850
I got my birthday on the 3rd of August
and we'll be cruising through to your gig

1136
01:08:20,180 --> 01:08:21,013
on the fifth.

1137
01:08:21,610 --> 01:08:25,730
Caught you a couple of years ago and
gave you a cigar after the show with the

1138
01:08:25,731 --> 01:08:30,110
roundhouse in Camden. Who knows, maybe
you smoked it. Of course I did. Okay,

1139
01:08:30,111 --> 01:08:35,060
so help me with this kind of weird
dilemma of mine. Here's the deal. I'm six,

1140
01:08:35,061 --> 01:08:37,580
two, six, three. On a good day, if
he's feeling good about himself,

1141
01:08:37,581 --> 01:08:40,430
he stands up straight and
I'm fairly trim. However,

1142
01:08:40,431 --> 01:08:44,300
due to my love of cake pie and
all the things donut I've packed,

1143
01:08:44,780 --> 01:08:49,580
I've packed on a mass in one
specific area. My belly. Oh God.

1144
01:08:49,581 --> 01:08:53,380
That's the classic European
fucking body, you know? Yeah.

1145
01:08:53,450 --> 01:08:57,710
They got those seventh grader arms and
then they just got the fucking fish and

1146
01:08:57,711 --> 01:09:00,830
chips belly. Like they're
generally a thinner people,

1147
01:09:00,890 --> 01:09:03,580
but they like their pubs
and they like, yeah,

1148
01:09:04,130 --> 01:09:06,140
thin or cause I think their
food is higher quality,

1149
01:09:06,141 --> 01:09:09,530
but they just don't go to the gym over
there. They walk around a lot though.

1150
01:09:09,780 --> 01:09:13,340
All right. My brother loves it. Um,

1151
01:09:13,370 --> 01:09:17,960
they've nicknamed me big belly
Bigsby a callback to Chappelle's,

1152
01:09:17,961 --> 01:09:20,120
Clayton Bigsby and I've become used to,

1153
01:09:20,900 --> 01:09:24,170
used to giving it a good old
fashioned slap from time to time.

1154
01:09:24,440 --> 01:09:26,540
My lady loves it too. She rubs it,

1155
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:31,490
wants to fill up with her rabbit food,
a, she's Vegan, whatever, et Cetera,

1156
01:09:31,491 --> 01:09:34,280
et cetera. It's a mind fuck subverts.

1157
01:09:34,281 --> 01:09:38,660
The whole guy's got to have a pack
vibe. You're losing me here anyways,

1158
01:09:38,661 --> 01:09:43,661
I'm gonna keep on going Michelangelo on
this bitch and getting into shape at the

1159
01:09:44,601 --> 01:09:48,980
risk of losing the fail safe laughter
of the day. What do you think?

1160
01:09:49,400 --> 01:09:49,971
Yeah, dude,

1161
01:09:49,971 --> 01:09:53,600
you don't want to be the fat guy who
slaps his belly like a fucking walrus

1162
01:09:53,601 --> 01:09:54,470
looking for a mate.

1163
01:09:54,580 --> 01:09:56,560
And if you don't get it under control,

1164
01:09:56,561 --> 01:09:59,380
it's going to get bigger and bigger and
it's going to be bad for your health.

1165
01:09:59,381 --> 01:10:03,010
So trust me, your girlfriend
might love the belly right now,

1166
01:10:03,011 --> 01:10:05,500
but she's going to really
love that six back.

1167
01:10:06,420 --> 01:10:07,830
Oh, really? What if she's insecure?

1168
01:10:07,920 --> 01:10:09,870
She's worried that he's going
to go out and fucking start,

1169
01:10:10,490 --> 01:10:11,790
do the full Monty someplace,

1170
01:10:12,070 --> 01:10:13,900
both work and get the six back together.

1171
01:10:13,901 --> 01:10:17,560
Although she might already have it since
she's a Vegan and obviously [inaudible]

1172
01:10:17,980 --> 01:10:22,270
happens and to keep what couples could
never work out. I don't like, yeah,

1173
01:10:22,271 --> 01:10:27,160
I'm not into it. But remember when we
tried to work out and I was just yelling,

1174
01:10:27,161 --> 01:10:30,980
you push it out, you know? No,

1175
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:34,120
we never worked out together like
that. We would go to the gym together.

1176
01:10:34,130 --> 01:10:37,210
Then we separate your thing. And I
would always, do we go do a party?

1177
01:10:37,211 --> 01:10:40,300
What do we do? We go in different
graphs. Words. Yeah. Yeah.

1178
01:10:40,420 --> 01:10:43,120
I came here to have a
good time. Not to be,

1179
01:10:43,590 --> 01:10:47,260
got to be with the person I live with.
[inaudible] I came here. I live with you.

1180
01:10:47,261 --> 01:10:48,900
I don't need to hang out
with you at this part.

1181
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,710
So what's going on with you in this
new environment? Um, all right.

1182
01:10:53,711 --> 01:10:56,110
I got to know your girlfriend's
gonna love the six bag,

1183
01:10:56,111 --> 01:11:00,280
so keep at it and like to keep a belly
just so people can slap it around so you

1184
01:11:00,281 --> 01:11:03,280
can be that guy at the party after
a while. Yeah, that's pathetic.

1185
01:11:03,820 --> 01:11:08,680
It's better to get shredded and
be, you know, real Michelangelo.

1186
01:11:09,940 --> 01:11:13,290
Yeah. And then you get to walk around
being a Dick, being aloof, you know,

1187
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:14,800
you just, every time people talk to you,

1188
01:11:14,810 --> 01:11:17,550
you pretend you're looking at something
down the street with your fucking

1189
01:11:17,551 --> 01:11:21,410
eyebrows up. Sorry man. I just
gotta keep on moving. You know,

1190
01:11:22,230 --> 01:11:26,430
I'm like a shark. Did you
talk about that poster?

1191
01:11:27,680 --> 01:11:30,270
Ah, yeah. Yeah, I missed it. Yeah.

1192
01:11:30,271 --> 01:11:33,580
The guy actually brought up a bunch
of great points, which is, oh,

1193
01:11:33,600 --> 01:11:38,370
I don't know if you want to go
back and read it. Um, I can't,

1194
01:11:38,371 --> 01:11:42,540
I don't remember. He was just saying
like, well no and 50 was like, Whoa,

1195
01:11:42,570 --> 01:11:45,600
here's one that I made it. If
he was holding up Hugh Jackman,

1196
01:11:45,870 --> 01:11:49,470
would that increase the chances
of guys fighting other guys?

1197
01:11:50,910 --> 01:11:55,410
I don't think it's about like increasing
like influencing people to do what?

1198
01:11:55,530 --> 01:11:59,190
It's just like, it's just not against.
It isn't a great look. I actually,

1199
01:11:59,191 --> 01:12:00,600
I don't think that it's a good poster,

1200
01:12:00,900 --> 01:12:05,420
but I would say that I don't think it
promotes violence against women. I don't,

1201
01:12:05,910 --> 01:12:07,170
I wouldn't think so either.

1202
01:12:07,230 --> 01:12:10,860
But although I'm not trying to speak
for blue women though. That's right.

1203
01:12:11,720 --> 01:12:13,560
They can speak for
themselves. No, I don't know.

1204
01:12:13,590 --> 01:12:18,510
I saw that poster and I first of
all couldn't tell it was a woman,

1205
01:12:18,840 --> 01:12:22,290
but if I was like well versed in
that whole thing, I would be like,

1206
01:12:22,320 --> 01:12:26,670
oh that's such and such character.
Uh, yeah, I don't, I dunno.

1207
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:30,230
But I think it's probably best
that they, they're all in the,

1208
01:12:30,240 --> 01:12:31,950
all the different poster I was saying.

1209
01:12:31,951 --> 01:12:36,330
They're all named after like
discontinued. Um, colognes. I'm like,

1210
01:12:36,331 --> 01:12:40,740
what mystique apocalypse just sounds like.

1211
01:12:41,100 --> 01:12:44,760
It's like whoever came up with Zima than
tried to get into Cologne and it all

1212
01:12:44,761 --> 01:12:47,430
fucking bombed. Right. Listen,

1213
01:12:47,440 --> 01:12:51,810
I unfortunately got to stop the podcast
cause I got to go to work. Boom,

1214
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:56,880
boom Boba [inaudible]. All right.
Thank you guys for listening.

1215
01:12:56,910 --> 01:13:00,990
And, um, I'll let you guys
know about those Presales, um,

1216
01:13:01,050 --> 01:13:04,050
for the upcoming dates in Ireland and, uh,

1217
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:06,840
thank you to everybody that's
been buying tickets in Scotland,

1218
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,910
in Amsterdam and London, and a second
show in London, Nini. That's so great.

1219
01:13:11,911 --> 01:13:15,930
Yeah. But I found this a Gaba where
I can fucking smoke a stick after.

1220
01:13:16,020 --> 01:13:19,830
I love that nice big picture
of fucking, I don't know,

1221
01:13:19,831 --> 01:13:24,700
Winston Churchill or some shit would
be wonderful. Right? I don't know, Nan,

1222
01:13:25,720 --> 01:13:29,580
we have, I don't ever say we never
shout out. Is that Winston Churchill?

1223
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,550
It's already made. All right.
With Winston Churchill in front,

1224
01:13:32,850 --> 01:13:36,450
I think ace is high. I believe that
was all right. Go fuck yourselves.

1225
01:13:36,480 --> 01:13:38,070
I'll check in on your Thursday.
