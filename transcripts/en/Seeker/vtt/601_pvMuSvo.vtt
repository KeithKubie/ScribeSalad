00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:05.310
Human memory is unreliable enough as it is,
but researchers interested in better understanding

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:10.230
how and where our memories are stored are
developing new ways to manipulate them.

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:15.010
The search for memory “engrams,” a collection
of identifiable neurons that physically represent

00:00:15.010 --> 00:00:18.640
a memory, has occupied scientists for over
a hundred years.

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:22.910
Turns out, memory is a complex process that
involves several brain areas.

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:27.619
We know that when your brain makes a memory,
physical changes and a strengthening of connections

00:00:27.619 --> 00:00:31.390
between neurons “encode” the information
so you can remember it.

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:35.610
The complete network of these neuronal changes
is what we now identify as an “engram”

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:36.800
or memory.

00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.840
Once scientists learned how and where memory
was stored they wanted to know if they could

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:41.860
manipulate it.

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:46.350
So, good news for your memory of that painful
breakup, teams of researchers have demonstrated

00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:50.390
that emotionally important memories can actually
be removed in mice.

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:55.580
It’s not full “Sunshine of the Spotless
Mind” for mice, but we’re getting there.

00:00:55.580 --> 00:01:00.061
In one study researchers eliminated a set
of cells in part of the brain’s emotional

00:01:00.061 --> 00:01:05.369
processing center, the amygdala, and were
able to ERASE a specific fear-associated memory

00:01:05.369 --> 00:01:07.329
of receiving an electric shock.

00:01:07.329 --> 00:01:11.650
In other studies, scientists were able to
use optogenetics to “implant” a memory

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:13.820
of pain and fear into mice.

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:18.280
By activating an engram of one place when
the mouse was actually in another.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.859
First, they created a memory of “safety”
by placing a genetically modified mouse in

00:01:22.859 --> 00:01:25.920
a new cage and letting it enjoy its experience.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:30.170
Then they placed the mouse in another cage
and delivered foot shocks that they did not

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:34.869
enjoy, while stimulating neurons that formed
the memory of the ‘safe’ cage at the same

00:01:34.869 --> 00:01:36.210
time.

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:41.350
When the mouse was returned to the “safe”
cage, they exhibited a classic freezing response,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:43.530
which is a mouse’s way of showing fear.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.749
This told researchers that as they intended,
the painful memory of the shock was now incorrectly

00:01:48.749 --> 00:01:51.429
associated with the previously safe place...

00:01:51.429 --> 00:01:52.429
Freaky.

00:01:52.429 --> 00:01:56.369
New results from experiments with human subjects
who already had electrodes implanted in their

00:01:56.369 --> 00:02:00.920
brains as a treatment for epilepsy, showed
that tracking learning efficiency through

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.159
brain wave monitoring by a machine learning
algorithm and pairing poor learning predictions

00:02:04.159 --> 00:02:07.279
with direct electrical stimulation of the
lateral temporal cortex, improved memory and

00:02:07.279 --> 00:02:10.259
recall .
Meaning, the right kind of stimulation could

00:02:10.259 --> 00:02:13.120
help us remember certain things we would otherwise
have forgotten.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.920
Which, could come in handy the next time we
need to cram for an exam.

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:22.250
Maybe in the future our ability to manipulate
memory will help us remember important information

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:27.060
and help us forget painful experiences - like
those associated with PTSD.

00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.120
But the results of these experiments also
calls into question how we know what we know.

00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:36.930
We use memories all the time to navigate life
and make predictions of future outcomes.

00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.950
The idea that memories are not immutable,
shakes our understanding of our subjective

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:42.950
experience.

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:45.780
I mean, who will we trust in the future if
not ourselves?

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:50.629
47% of the general population surveyed in
a published study believed that “once you

00:02:50.629 --> 00:02:54.620
have experienced an event and formed a memory
of it, that memory does not change” after

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:57.110
watching this video, do you agree?

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.180

Trace’s video, here, to find out whether

00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:02.829
typing or handwriting is better for your memory!
