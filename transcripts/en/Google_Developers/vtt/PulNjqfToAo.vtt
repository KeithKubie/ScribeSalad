00:00:08.230 --> 00:00:10.760
A couple of days ago, I received
this email from

00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:11.790
Google Analytics.

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:15.610
It's an intelligence alert
notifying me that the page

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:19.070
loading time for mobile visitors
to my site has an

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:20.670
unusual spike.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:23.350
And this is a feature of Google
Analytics, that I don't

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:24.700
think many people know about.

00:00:24.700 --> 00:00:27.240
And, in fact, you can use
it to monitor your web

00:00:27.240 --> 00:00:29.950
performance metrics, which
is really cool.

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:32.759
So I figured I'd give you
guys a quick overview.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.230
So, first of all, let's start
at the beginning.

00:00:35.230 --> 00:00:37.240
That's always a good
place to start.

00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:38.530
We're looking at Google
Analytics, so

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:39.350
we just logged in.

00:00:39.350 --> 00:00:41.050
This is your regular report.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:43.220
This is specific to my site,
so this is [INAUDIBLE]

00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:44.090
dot com.

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:47.040
So let's find intelligence
reports.

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:50.460
For that, you need to click into
home, and you have this

00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.460
section here called Intelligence
Events, so let's

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:56.790
go to that overview, and what
you'll see here is that Google

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:59.760
Analytics creates a number of
automatic alerts for things

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.400
like number of page views, of
visits, bounce rates, and a

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:05.900
few other things.

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.060
You can see that there are some
alerts that are firing

00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.530
here already.

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:13.630
But the real power of this
functionality here is that you

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:16.370
can actually customize
it to any metric

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.480
within Google Analytics.

00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.640
And as you may know, Google
Analytics tracks web

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.460
performance metrics through
navigation timing, which means

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:27.440
that we can also set up alerts
and get notifications for

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:31.230
things like page loading times,
response times, DNS,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:32.490
and many other things.

00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:35.170
So in fact, that's exactly
what I did.

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:36.990
That's why I got that alert.

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:40.130
So I have a couple of custom
alerts set up in my account.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:41.590
One is called--

00:01:41.590 --> 00:01:44.470
One is specifically tracking
mobile and the other one is

00:01:44.470 --> 00:01:48.170
just a generic page loading
time difference.

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.070
So these are actual alerts that
have fired over the past

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:52.690
couple of days.

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:54.270
So let's take a look
at one of them.

00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:57.790
We have this PLT, stands for
page load time, so I'm going

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.860
to click on the details
section for

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:01.530
this guy right here.

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:05.160
And what you can see here
is the actual alert.

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.430
So this graph here shows you
the average page load time.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:12.370
It's across all of my visitors
for all of my pages, and on

00:02:12.370 --> 00:02:16.850
November 23, there's little kind
of bump right here, and

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.660
this actually triggered
an alert.

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:21.900
And the best part about Google
Analytics is not that it just

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.520
detected that there's this
little bump here, but it

00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.220
actually tries to infer as to
what are the contributors to

00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:29.680
this bump right here.

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:33.500
And what it figured out was that
the major contributors

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:37.480
are likely from India,
from city of Chennai.

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:42.650
And, in fact, it's looking at
the metrics for those segments

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:45.310
and it's saying, look, on
average, same day in the

00:02:45.310 --> 00:02:49.460
previous week, the page load
time was about 10 seconds, for

00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:51.350
whatever reason it's
30 seconds.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.470
That's not good.

00:02:53.470 --> 00:02:56.820
For this specific city, the
page load time spiked from

00:02:56.820 --> 00:02:58.870
seven to 90 seconds.

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:01.000
That's terrible.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.930
Something is terribly
wrong there.

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:06.410
So not only that, but you can
also click on these things

00:03:06.410 --> 00:03:10.375
right here, it will reload the
graph and show you the page

00:03:10.375 --> 00:03:12.160
load time for this
specific segment.

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:14.925
So now we're looking at India,
and as you can see the page

00:03:14.925 --> 00:03:19.050
load time is semi-reasonable,
six, seven seconds, but ever

00:03:19.050 --> 00:03:23.170
once in a while we get these
spikes, 25 seconds, 25, and in

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.770
this case, 32 seconds.

00:03:24.770 --> 00:03:28.760
So there's something systematic
going wrong here,

00:03:28.760 --> 00:03:30.210
and I don't know exactly
what it is.

00:03:30.210 --> 00:03:31.690
I need to track it down.

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.940
We can also drill into the
specific cities and look at

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:35.830
the same graph.

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:39.510
And, in fact, you can see that
this is a second occurrence of

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:40.490
the same event.

00:03:40.490 --> 00:03:42.990
So this happened earlier and
I didn't catch this.

00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:47.560
So this is where having an alert
is very, very useful.

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.910
First, you'll know
that something

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:51.020
anomalous has happened.

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:54.070
I wouldn't have detected this
otherwise, and two, it can

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.140
actually help you figure
out what is the

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.170
cause of the problem.

00:03:58.170 --> 00:04:01.490
So with that, let's actually
take a look at how you would

00:04:01.490 --> 00:04:04.450
go about setting up one of
these custom alerts.

00:04:04.450 --> 00:04:07.440
So let's close that,
and we can go into

00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:09.280
manage custom alerts.

00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:12.180
Create an alert.

00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:18.630
And let's create an alert, I
don't know, let's track Japan.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.370
Actually, you know what?

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:30.030
We're going to look
at all traffic,

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.972
we're looking for country.

00:04:31.972 --> 00:04:34.200
So we're going to look at
country and territory, matches

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.600
exactly, Japan.

00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.080
That's what we want.

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:42.510
And so here we're defining what
segment of the traffic

00:04:42.510 --> 00:04:45.200
that we want this alert
to apply to.

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:47.900
Then we need to specify the
actual metric, which is going

00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.030
to be used to track the alert.

00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:53.870
So in this case, we actually
have a number of navigation

00:04:53.870 --> 00:04:55.830
time metrics that we're tracking
Google Analytics.

00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:59.740
So we can look at things like
response time, so this is your

00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:00.660
server response.

00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:03.250
So, for whatever reason, if your
server starts responding

00:05:03.250 --> 00:05:06.340
slowly to specific visitors,
you can flag that here.

00:05:06.340 --> 00:05:11.770
I'm going to look at
page load time.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:15.140
So this is the average page load
time, and I'm going to

00:05:15.140 --> 00:05:20.530
trigger this if it increases
by more than,

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:23.190
let's say, 30% on--

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:26.250
you can do on a previous day,
previous year, or previous

00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.440
week, so in my earlier alert, I
just used the previous week,

00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:32.200
but let's create this
one right here.

00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:34.000
So that's it.

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.270
We can save the alert and
Google Analytics will

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:40.960
automatically monitor
and notify you.

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.675
And you can apply this against
multiple profiles, here I'm

00:05:43.675 --> 00:05:46.050
just specifying one site.

00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:49.700
You can specify the period as
well, so this is for how far

00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.060
back should the alerts look at
to detect these anomalies?

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:56.420
So it should be a day, a week,
or perhaps, even a month.

00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:59.320
So that's a very quick
introduction, but there's

00:05:59.320 --> 00:06:00.740
actually much, much more.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:06.640
And to understand the power of
what this gives you, you

00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:09.870
really have to familiarize
yourself with advanced

00:06:09.870 --> 00:06:12.050
segments of Google Analytics.

00:06:12.050 --> 00:06:15.230
So let's cancel out of this, and
let's head back into our

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:17.810
standard reports.

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:23.810
And let's actually look at the
site speed reports, which is

00:06:23.810 --> 00:06:26.390
using navigation timing
to track all

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:27.820
the performance data.

00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:29.445
So here's our little
spike that we

00:06:29.445 --> 00:06:31.600
were looking at earlier.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:36.270
And let's say, we want to
compare this against desktop

00:06:36.270 --> 00:06:37.770
or maybe mobile traffic.

00:06:37.770 --> 00:06:39.910
So you can click on bad segments
and Google Analytics

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:42.370
gives you, by default,
a number of segments.

00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:48.370
So mobile is one, and I can
compare this to, let's say,

00:06:48.370 --> 00:06:51.400
all visits.

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:53.900
Let's hit Apply.

00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:57.100
And it will provide us with two
segments, so now you can

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:02.720
see that the orange line here is
the all visits and the blue

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:04.050
line is the mobile traffic.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:05.880
So mobile's doing pretty well.

00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:10.460
There's two spikes, but then
look at this, the desktop or

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.770
the averages for all of my
visits are fine, but mobile

00:07:13.770 --> 00:07:15.170
specifically, is
what's spiking.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:18.500
So this already gives me a way
to figure out, is it mobile

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:21.290
visitors or somebody else that's
contributing to this

00:07:21.290 --> 00:07:22.600
spike right here.

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:31.520
But that's kind of cool, but
the real power in the story

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.000
here is the fact they can define
your own segments.

00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:36.930
So let's do exactly that.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:42.020
We'll create a new segment,
and we can, once again, we

00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:44.710
have access to all the Google
Analytics variables, so we can

00:07:44.710 --> 00:07:45.960
say continents.

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:52.810
Let's look at Asia.

00:07:52.810 --> 00:07:59.950
We can add an or statement so we
can look at Asia or Europe.

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.540
Let's add another one,
so continent again.

00:08:07.260 --> 00:08:11.760
Let's see, or let's do North
America perhaps.

00:08:19.320 --> 00:08:20.290
Not coming up right now.

00:08:20.290 --> 00:08:24.280
Well, you can define multiple
continents or any multiple

00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:28.060
metrics, and you can also end,
so there's an or statement and

00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:29.090
an end statement.

00:08:29.090 --> 00:08:33.330
So we can filter down the
specific segment that we're

00:08:33.330 --> 00:08:33.789
looking for.

00:08:33.789 --> 00:08:37.860
So let's add an end
statement in here.

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:40.789
So you can look at the
hundreds of different

00:08:40.789 --> 00:08:43.690
variables that are in here, and
you have access both to

00:08:43.690 --> 00:08:45.670
the dimensions and individual
metrics.

00:08:45.670 --> 00:08:48.160
So there's things like if you
have defined goals or revenue

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.180
conversions, you can actually
track that here.

00:08:50.180 --> 00:08:52.465
So you can say, look, I'm
concerned about visitors that

00:08:52.465 --> 00:08:55.740
come from Asia that are
purchasing stuff on my site.

00:08:55.740 --> 00:08:59.810
But you also have all of the
page loading time metrics and

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:00.940
all the rest.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.000
So lots and lots of
flexibility here.

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.660
And the cool part is once you
define the segment, so I'll

00:09:08.660 --> 00:09:11.520
show you a couple of segments
that I defined previously.

00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:18.350
For example, I have visitors
from Japan that are coming on

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:20.035
a desktop browser.

00:09:23.060 --> 00:09:29.000
And if I apply that,
that's what we're

00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:29.970
looking at are here.

00:09:29.970 --> 00:09:33.080
Now, now that we've defined the
segment, we can actually

00:09:33.080 --> 00:09:38.100
head back into Home,
Intelligence Events, and when

00:09:38.100 --> 00:09:43.670
we're defining a new custom
alert, now you

00:09:43.670 --> 00:09:45.210
can use this segment.

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:48.210
So instead of just saying all
traffic, you have this tab

00:09:48.210 --> 00:09:49.510
here called custom segments.

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:53.985
You can open this up, and you
have all of the segments that

00:09:53.985 --> 00:09:54.870
you defined previously.

00:09:54.870 --> 00:09:57.550
So, for example, visitors
from San Francisco

00:09:57.550 --> 00:09:58.720
coming on mobile phone.

00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.880
That's something that I've
defined specifically for my

00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.070
site, but you could have created
a different segment,

00:10:03.070 --> 00:10:07.850
which is related to registered
users that have purchased

00:10:07.850 --> 00:10:11.610
something on your site in the
last 30 days, for example.

00:10:11.610 --> 00:10:17.210
And that you want an alert if
one of those users' page load

00:10:17.210 --> 00:10:23.660
time is greater than 10 seconds,
and that's it.

00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.160
You save this alert, and you
would get, if something bad

00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:30.270
happens, you would get
an alert like this.

00:10:30.270 --> 00:10:32.260
You can go into Google Analytics
and figure out

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.070
what's going on, which
is pretty awesome.
