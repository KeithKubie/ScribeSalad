00:00:00.084 --> 00:00:01.500
SPEAKER: In this
video, we'll walk

00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:03.870
through how to provide
your users the ability

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:07.230
to upgrade their subscriptions
and what that process looks

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.090
like behind the scenes.

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:11.310
If the user is trying
to access a feature that

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:13.920
requires a more
expensive subscription,

00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.840
you'll want to have a
way for them to upgrade

00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.510
their current subscription.

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:22.500
When your app starts, call Start
Connection in the Google Play

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.390
Billing Library.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.190
Once the connection
is complete, you

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.890
will also need to call
Query Purchases in order

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:30.960
to handle existing purchases.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.870
Make sure to override
on purchases updated

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:36.720
in order to handle any future
purchases that complete

00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.670
while your app is open.

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:42.240
Each of your subscription
products has a unique SKU.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.400
To change from one
product to another,

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:46.950
you just need the SKU for
the existing subscription

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:51.120
product and the SKU for the
new subscription product.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:53.460
To perform an upgrade,
launch the Purchase

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:55.740
Flow with the Google
Play Billing Library

00:00:55.740 --> 00:00:59.070
using the parameter set old SKU.

00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:01.500
Replace the old SKU
with the upgrade SKU

00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:05.040
by using the billing flow
params builder set old SKU

00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.750
and set SKU.

00:01:07.750 --> 00:01:11.110
Enter the new upgraded
SKU in the set SKU field,

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.780
and Google Play will take
care of any additional payment

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:14.920
needed.

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.950
It's important to note that you
can set the proration mode here

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:18.860
as well.

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:21.800
Check the documentation
for more information.

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:24.100
Google Play will send
you a new purchase token

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.800
through the Billing Library,
and that purchase token

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.780
will follow the
same steps outlined

00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:31.690
in our video Understanding
Purchase Flow.

00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:35.140
Your app registers the new
token with your back end servers

00:01:35.140 --> 00:01:39.190
and sends it to the Google Play
Developer API for verification.

00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:41.080
But there is one
important difference here

00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:43.900
from first-time
subscription purchases.

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:46.540
This time, Google
Play Developer API

00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.752
will return a linked
purchase token field

00:01:48.752 --> 00:01:49.960
in the subscription response.

00:01:52.590 --> 00:01:55.490
Be sure to invalidate the
token provided in the linked

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:59.120
purchase token to make sure
that the old token is not used

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:02.360
to get access to your services.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:05.870
Your server will store
this updated information

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:08.210
and let the app know the
user's subscription has

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.120
been successfully upgraded.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.880
You can follow the same
process to provide your users

00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.310
with a subscription
downgrade option, which

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:19.100
you could make available in the
settings section of your app.

00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.690
