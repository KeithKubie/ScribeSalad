00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:02.149
so let me first tell you what a braid is

00:00:02.149 --> 00:00:02.159
so let me first tell you what a braid is
 

00:00:02.159 --> 00:00:04.880
so let me first tell you what a braid is
imagine that you have like two wooden

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:04.890
imagine that you have like two wooden
 

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.309
imagine that you have like two wooden
planks and then there are some strings

00:00:07.309 --> 00:00:07.319
planks and then there are some strings
 

00:00:07.319 --> 00:00:11.180
planks and then there are some strings
attached in a neat row to the first

00:00:11.180 --> 00:00:11.190
attached in a neat row to the first
 

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:13.669
attached in a neat row to the first
wooden plank and then they are all

00:00:13.669 --> 00:00:13.679
wooden plank and then they are all
 

00:00:13.679 --> 00:00:17.150
wooden plank and then they are all
tangled up but then when they arrive to

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:17.160
tangled up but then when they arrive to
 

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.769
tangled up but then when they arrive to
the top they are again in a neat

00:00:20.769 --> 00:00:20.779
the top they are again in a neat
 

00:00:20.779 --> 00:00:23.599
the top they are again in a neat
straight line where they started so like

00:00:23.599 --> 00:00:23.609
straight line where they started so like
 

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:26.420
straight line where they started so like
one goes to one two goes to two yes so

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
one goes to one two goes to two yes so
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.339
one goes to one two goes to two yes so
that's called a pure braid and when we

00:00:28.339 --> 00:00:28.349
that's called a pure braid and when we
 

00:00:28.349 --> 00:00:30.050
that's called a pure braid and when we
talk about pure braids today it doesn't

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:30.060
talk about pure braids today it doesn't
 

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:32.569
talk about pure braids today it doesn't
hugely matter you can also consider ones

00:00:32.569 --> 00:00:32.579
hugely matter you can also consider ones
 

00:00:32.579 --> 00:00:34.220
hugely matter you can also consider ones
that that crisscross an end that's

00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:34.230
that that crisscross an end that's
 

00:00:34.230 --> 00:00:35.959
that that crisscross an end that's
somewhere else but let me try to draw

00:00:35.959 --> 00:00:35.969
somewhere else but let me try to draw
 

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.670
somewhere else but let me try to draw
and that actually goes back to where it

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.680
and that actually goes back to where it
 

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:38.299
and that actually goes back to where it
started from

00:00:38.299 --> 00:00:38.309
started from
 

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:41.060
started from
it goes from bottom to the top in

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:41.070
it goes from bottom to the top in
 

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.819
it goes from bottom to the top in
between you have some tangled mess so

00:00:43.819 --> 00:00:43.829
between you have some tangled mess so
 

00:00:43.829 --> 00:00:45.229
between you have some tangled mess so
when you have some big tangled mess

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:45.239
when you have some big tangled mess
 

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.299
when you have some big tangled mess
what's your what's the first question

00:00:47.299 --> 00:00:47.309
what's your what's the first question
 

00:00:47.309 --> 00:00:48.290
what's your what's the first question
that comes to mind

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:48.300
that comes to mind
 

00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:50.420
that comes to mind
how would you untangle it how would you

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:50.430
how would you untangle it how would you
 

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:53.750
how would you untangle it how would you
untangle it or can you even untangle it

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:53.760
untangle it or can you even untangle it
 

00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.970
untangle it or can you even untangle it
so sometimes you have a big tangled mess

00:00:55.970 --> 00:00:55.980
so sometimes you have a big tangled mess
 

00:00:55.980 --> 00:00:58.849
so sometimes you have a big tangled mess
and it's entirely possible to untangle

00:00:58.849 --> 00:00:58.859
and it's entirely possible to untangle
 

00:00:58.859 --> 00:01:00.680
and it's entirely possible to untangle
it what does it mean to untangle it it

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:00.690
it what does it mean to untangle it it
 

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:04.460
it what does it mean to untangle it it
means to make it into this braid this is

00:01:04.460 --> 00:01:04.470
means to make it into this braid this is
 

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.469
means to make it into this braid this is
like the non brain so how do you

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
like the non brain so how do you
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:08.780
like the non brain so how do you
untangle something so imagine that the

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
untangle something so imagine that the
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:11.270
untangle something so imagine that the
strands are say made of rubber they are

00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:11.280
strands are say made of rubber they are
 

00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:13.609
strands are say made of rubber they are
stretchy you can move them around as

00:01:13.609 --> 00:01:13.619
stretchy you can move them around as
 

00:01:13.619 --> 00:01:15.800
stretchy you can move them around as
much as you want you can stretch as much

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:15.810
much as you want you can stretch as much
 

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:18.170
much as you want you can stretch as much
as you want but you cannot cut them once

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:18.180
as you want but you cannot cut them once
 

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:20.960
as you want but you cannot cut them once
you cut them the game is ruined so the

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:20.970
you cut them the game is ruined so the
 

00:01:20.970 --> 00:01:22.429
you cut them the game is ruined so the
question is if you see a tangled mess

00:01:22.429 --> 00:01:22.439
question is if you see a tangled mess
 

00:01:22.439 --> 00:01:25.219
question is if you see a tangled mess
like this can you make it into a and

00:01:25.219 --> 00:01:25.229
like this can you make it into a and
 

00:01:25.229 --> 00:01:27.350
like this can you make it into a and
untangle this has some practical

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:27.360
untangle this has some practical
 

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:29.270
untangle this has some practical
applications for example if you made

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:29.280
applications for example if you made
 

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:32.060
applications for example if you made
this I do a year ago I had long hair and

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
this I do a year ago I had long hair and
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:35.330
this I do a year ago I had long hair and
when you braid long hair oh maybe I can

00:01:35.330 --> 00:01:35.340
when you braid long hair oh maybe I can
 

00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.830
when you braid long hair oh maybe I can
show you on just this little bit so the

00:01:39.830 --> 00:01:39.840
show you on just this little bit so the
 

00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.109
show you on just this little bit so the
standard thing you do is you divide it

00:01:42.109 --> 00:01:42.119
standard thing you do is you divide it
 

00:01:42.119 --> 00:01:45.410
standard thing you do is you divide it
into three parts this will make me look

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:45.420
into three parts this will make me look
 

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:49.460
into three parts this will make me look
rather silly and then you do this braid

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:49.470
rather silly and then you do this braid
 

00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:51.620
rather silly and then you do this braid
one goes over it the middle one and then

00:01:51.620 --> 00:01:51.630
one goes over it the middle one and then
 

00:01:51.630 --> 00:01:53.990
one goes over it the middle one and then
the other goes over but became the

00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:54.000
the other goes over but became the
 

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.480
the other goes over but became the
middle one and you just continue doing

00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:56.490
middle one and you just continue doing
 

00:01:56.490 --> 00:02:02.780
middle one and you just continue doing
this until you reach the end of your

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:02.790
this until you reach the end of your
 

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.389
this until you reach the end of your
hair and then you put an elastic on it

00:02:05.389 --> 00:02:05.399
hair and then you put an elastic on it
 

00:02:05.399 --> 00:02:08.630
hair and then you put an elastic on it
now it's not two wooden planks but at

00:02:08.630 --> 00:02:08.640
now it's not two wooden planks but at
 

00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:11.180
now it's not two wooden planks but at
the top it's attached to your head and

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
the top it's attached to your head and
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.210
the top it's attached to your head and
at the bottom it's fastened

00:02:13.210 --> 00:02:13.220
at the bottom it's fastened
 

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:15.550
at the bottom it's fastened
an elastic so the top and bottom are

00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:15.560
an elastic so the top and bottom are
 

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:18.310
an elastic so the top and bottom are
kind of fixed the same as in the picture

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:18.320
kind of fixed the same as in the picture
 

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.470
kind of fixed the same as in the picture
that I just showed you and the good

00:02:20.470 --> 00:02:20.480
that I just showed you and the good
 

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.180
that I just showed you and the good
thing about that parade is that it

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.190
thing about that parade is that it
 

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:24.490
thing about that parade is that it
cannot be untangled because if it could

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:24.500
cannot be untangled because if it could
 

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:26.350
cannot be untangled because if it could
be untangled then as you move your head

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:26.360
be untangled then as you move your head
 

00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:27.700
be untangled then as you move your head
around it probably would become

00:02:27.700 --> 00:02:27.710
around it probably would become
 

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:29.560
around it probably would become
untangled and the one that I just drew

00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:29.570
untangled and the one that I just drew
 

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.170
untangled and the one that I just drew
probably cannot be untangled for example

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:32.180
probably cannot be untangled for example
 

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.940
probably cannot be untangled for example
if you look at just the first and the

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:33.950
if you look at just the first and the
 

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:37.000
if you look at just the first and the
last string you can see that those are

00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:37.010
last string you can see that those are
 

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:42.040
last string you can see that those are
like this they they are kind of wrapped

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:42.050
like this they they are kind of wrapped
 

00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:44.110
like this they they are kind of wrapped
around each other in a way that you

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:44.120
around each other in a way that you
 

00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.370
around each other in a way that you
can't imagine untangling so why is it

00:02:48.370 --> 00:02:48.380
can't imagine untangling so why is it
 

00:02:48.380 --> 00:02:50.620
can't imagine untangling so why is it
that some rates cannot be undone when

00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:50.630
that some rates cannot be undone when
 

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:53.080
that some rates cannot be undone when
you move the strands around move the

00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:53.090
you move the strands around move the
 

00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:55.240
you move the strands around move the
strings around what's the problem that

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:55.250
strings around what's the problem that
 

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:57.910
strings around what's the problem that
you might run into it's the two strands

00:02:57.910 --> 00:02:57.920
you might run into it's the two strands
 

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.040
you might run into it's the two strands
catch on each other and you can't move

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:00.050
catch on each other and you can't move
 

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:01.720
catch on each other and you can't move
them past each other without breaking

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:01.730
them past each other without breaking
 

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:03.610
them past each other without breaking
them so that's the main reason that some

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:03.620
them so that's the main reason that some
 

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:05.530
them so that's the main reason that some
braids cannot be undone if the strands

00:03:05.530 --> 00:03:05.540
braids cannot be undone if the strands
 

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:06.880
braids cannot be undone if the strands
would just go through each other

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:06.890
would just go through each other
 

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.780
would just go through each other
magically it ghosts then any braids

00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:10.790
magically it ghosts then any braids
 

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:13.020
magically it ghosts then any braids
could be undone this is in

00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:13.030
could be undone this is in
 

00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.070
could be undone this is in
three-dimensional space that we all know

00:03:15.070 --> 00:03:15.080
three-dimensional space that we all know
 

00:03:15.080 --> 00:03:16.480
three-dimensional space that we all know
very well because we live in it I'm

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:16.490
very well because we live in it I'm
 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:20.979
very well because we live in it I'm
claiming that if you think of braids in

00:03:20.979 --> 00:03:20.989
claiming that if you think of braids in
 

00:03:20.989 --> 00:03:23.680
claiming that if you think of braids in
four dimensional space then they become

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:23.690
four dimensional space then they become
 

00:03:23.690 --> 00:03:26.050
four dimensional space then they become
completely uninteresting the main reason

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.060
completely uninteresting the main reason
 

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:27.940
completely uninteresting the main reason
is that if you have two strands in four

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950
is that if you have two strands in four
 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.160
is that if you have two strands in four
dimensional space they can basically go

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:30.170
dimensional space they can basically go
 

00:03:30.170 --> 00:03:32.380
dimensional space they can basically go
through each other like ghosts so why is

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:32.390
through each other like ghosts so why is
 

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.930
through each other like ghosts so why is
that let me try to give you an analogy

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:34.940
that let me try to give you an analogy
 

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:38.350
that let me try to give you an analogy
first so there's a little ant that lives

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:38.360
first so there's a little ant that lives
 

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:41.050
first so there's a little ant that lives
in the plane so this ant is

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:41.060
in the plane so this ant is
 

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.020
in the plane so this ant is
two-dimensional all it ever knew was

00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:44.030
two-dimensional all it ever knew was
 

00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:46.930
two-dimensional all it ever knew was
this two-dimensional plane that it lives

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:46.940
this two-dimensional plane that it lives
 

00:03:46.940 --> 00:03:49.570
this two-dimensional plane that it lives
in and this two-dimensional plane has a

00:03:49.570 --> 00:03:49.580
in and this two-dimensional plane has a
 

00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:52.600
in and this two-dimensional plane has a
wall the wall is one dimensional it's

00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:52.610
wall the wall is one dimensional it's
 

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:55.390
wall the wall is one dimensional it's
just a line in the plane so this little

00:03:55.390 --> 00:03:55.400
just a line in the plane so this little
 

00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:58.090
just a line in the plane so this little
ant can't go through the wall and we'll

00:03:58.090 --> 00:03:58.100
ant can't go through the wall and we'll
 

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:00.400
ant can't go through the wall and we'll
never know what's on the other side of

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:00.410
never know what's on the other side of
 

00:04:00.410 --> 00:04:02.890
never know what's on the other side of
the wall it just hits a red line it just

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:02.900
the wall it just hits a red line it just
 

00:04:02.900 --> 00:04:04.750
the wall it just hits a red line it just
hits a red line and it can't go through

00:04:04.750 --> 00:04:04.760
hits a red line and it can't go through
 

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:09.040
hits a red line and it can't go through
it what happens if one day a miracle

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:09.050
it what happens if one day a miracle
 

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.800
it what happens if one day a miracle
happens and all of a sudden the world of

00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:11.810
happens and all of a sudden the world of
 

00:04:11.810 --> 00:04:15.340
happens and all of a sudden the world of
this end becomes 3-dimensional so all of

00:04:15.340 --> 00:04:15.350
this end becomes 3-dimensional so all of
 

00:04:15.350 --> 00:04:18.670
this end becomes 3-dimensional so all of
a sudden there's height that day the end

00:04:18.670 --> 00:04:18.680
a sudden there's height that day the end
 

00:04:18.680 --> 00:04:20.740
a sudden there's height that day the end
could just go up to the line and say

00:04:20.740 --> 00:04:20.750
could just go up to the line and say
 

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:23.380
could just go up to the line and say
wait but this line has no height at all

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:23.390
wait but this line has no height at all
 

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:26.080
wait but this line has no height at all
so I can just jump over it and discover

00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:26.090
so I can just jump over it and discover
 

00:04:26.090 --> 00:04:26.420
so I can just jump over it and discover
the

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:26.430
the
 

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:29.300
the
their side so that's how if you add a

00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:29.310
their side so that's how if you add a
 

00:04:29.310 --> 00:04:34.070
their side so that's how if you add a
dimension things that were uncrossable

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:34.080
dimension things that were uncrossable
 

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.980
dimension things that were uncrossable
before are suddenly crossable because

00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:36.990
before are suddenly crossable because
 

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:38.930
before are suddenly crossable because
you can use the extra dimension to cross

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:38.940
you can use the extra dimension to cross
 

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.900
you can use the extra dimension to cross
them is that assuming that when we kick

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:41.910
them is that assuming that when we kick
 

00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.120
them is that assuming that when we kick
up to the fourth dimension our hair

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:44.130
up to the fourth dimension our hair
 

00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.980
up to the fourth dimension our hair
doesn't take on an extra dimension with

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:45.990
doesn't take on an extra dimension with
 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:47.810
doesn't take on an extra dimension with
it exactly yes

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:47.820
it exactly yes
 

00:04:47.820 --> 00:04:52.310
it exactly yes
exactly so this wall that the end that

00:04:52.310 --> 00:04:52.320
exactly so this wall that the end that
 

00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.980
exactly so this wall that the end that
that has kept the end on one side of its

00:04:54.980 --> 00:04:54.990
that has kept the end on one side of its
 

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:57.800
that has kept the end on one side of its
plane for its entire life when you add

00:04:57.800 --> 00:04:57.810
plane for its entire life when you add
 

00:04:57.810 --> 00:04:59.689
plane for its entire life when you add
it an extra dimension the wall didn't

00:04:59.689 --> 00:04:59.699
it an extra dimension the wall didn't
 

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:01.760
it an extra dimension the wall didn't
suddenly become infinitely high in

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:01.770
suddenly become infinitely high in
 

00:05:01.770 --> 00:05:03.170
suddenly become infinitely high in
two-dimensional so that's a very good

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:03.180
two-dimensional so that's a very good
 

00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.540
two-dimensional so that's a very good
point so let me try to show you why this

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:05.550
point so let me try to show you why this
 

00:05:05.550 --> 00:05:07.730
point so let me try to show you why this
end picture is relevant to the braids

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:07.740
end picture is relevant to the braids
 

00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.300
end picture is relevant to the braids
and the fourth dimension so you have a

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:11.310
and the fourth dimension so you have a
 

00:05:11.310 --> 00:05:13.580
and the fourth dimension so you have a
braid in three dimensions and you can't

00:05:13.580 --> 00:05:13.590
braid in three dimensions and you can't
 

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:16.850
braid in three dimensions and you can't
untangle it because somewhere you have

00:05:16.850 --> 00:05:16.860
untangle it because somewhere you have
 

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:19.040
untangle it because somewhere you have
two strands that you want to move past

00:05:19.040 --> 00:05:19.050
two strands that you want to move past
 

00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.290
two strands that you want to move past
each other and you can so this is one

00:05:21.290 --> 00:05:21.300
each other and you can so this is one
 

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:27.680
each other and you can so this is one
strand and behind it there's another

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:27.690
strand and behind it there's another
 

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:31.969
strand and behind it there's another
strand and you want to move it past what

00:05:31.969 --> 00:05:31.979
strand and you want to move it past what
 

00:05:31.979 --> 00:05:34.790
strand and you want to move it past what
you can't because it gets stuck on this

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:34.800
you can't because it gets stuck on this
 

00:05:34.800 --> 00:05:36.860
you can't because it gets stuck on this
strand that's in front of it yeah so

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:36.870
strand that's in front of it yeah so
 

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.010
strand that's in front of it yeah so
what you want to do is to move this but

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:40.020
what you want to do is to move this but
 

00:05:40.020 --> 00:05:40.899
what you want to do is to move this but
it's not working

00:05:40.899 --> 00:05:40.909
it's not working
 

00:05:40.909 --> 00:05:44.990
it's not working
imagine the plane in which this front

00:05:44.990 --> 00:05:45.000
imagine the plane in which this front
 

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.969
imagine the plane in which this front
strand lives and this strand behind that

00:05:49.969 --> 00:05:49.979
strand lives and this strand behind that
 

00:05:49.979 --> 00:05:52.250
strand lives and this strand behind that
you're trying to move past will only

00:05:52.250 --> 00:05:52.260
you're trying to move past will only
 

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.710
you're trying to move past will only
intersect that plane in one point right

00:05:54.710 --> 00:05:54.720
intersect that plane in one point right
 

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.960
intersect that plane in one point right
so that point will basically be the end

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:56.970
so that point will basically be the end
 

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:59.390
so that point will basically be the end
so if you're just thinking of the

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
so if you're just thinking of the
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.399
so if you're just thinking of the
picture that you can see in this one

00:06:01.399 --> 00:06:01.409
picture that you can see in this one
 

00:06:01.409 --> 00:06:04.010
picture that you can see in this one
plane then you have the end which is

00:06:04.010 --> 00:06:04.020
plane then you have the end which is
 

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.040
plane then you have the end which is
where the strand behind intersects the

00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:07.050
where the strand behind intersects the
 

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:09.680
where the strand behind intersects the
plane and you have this other strand

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:09.690
plane and you have this other strand
 

00:06:09.690 --> 00:06:11.300
plane and you have this other strand
which lives in the plane and that's the

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:11.310
which lives in the plane and that's the
 

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:14.480
which lives in the plane and that's the
wall and then when I try to move this

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:14.490
wall and then when I try to move this
 

00:06:14.490 --> 00:06:16.939
wall and then when I try to move this
strand behind and get stuck on this

00:06:16.939 --> 00:06:16.949
strand behind and get stuck on this
 

00:06:16.949 --> 00:06:19.490
strand behind and get stuck on this
trend that's basically the end running

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:19.500
trend that's basically the end running
 

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.050
trend that's basically the end running
up against the wall that becomes the

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.060
up against the wall that becomes the
 

00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.790
up against the wall that becomes the
hitting point of the two strands that

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:22.800
hitting point of the two strands that
 

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:25.550
hitting point of the two strands that
becomes the hitting point but if I add

00:06:25.550 --> 00:06:25.560
becomes the hitting point but if I add
 

00:06:25.560 --> 00:06:27.529
becomes the hitting point but if I add
an extra dimension now this is hard to

00:06:27.529 --> 00:06:27.539
an extra dimension now this is hard to
 

00:06:27.539 --> 00:06:30.170
an extra dimension now this is hard to
imagine because I mean the the braid is

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:30.180
imagine because I mean the the braid is
 

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.450
imagine because I mean the the braid is
already in three-dimensional space so

00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:32.460
already in three-dimensional space so
 

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:35.810
already in three-dimensional space so
then I have an extra fourth dimension

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:35.820
then I have an extra fourth dimension
 

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.399
then I have an extra fourth dimension
you can imagine that extra fourth

00:06:37.399 --> 00:06:37.409
you can imagine that extra fourth
 

00:06:37.409 --> 00:06:40.010
you can imagine that extra fourth
dimension by imagining that this

00:06:40.010 --> 00:06:40.020
dimension by imagining that this
 

00:06:40.020 --> 00:06:42.170
dimension by imagining that this
playing all of a sudden becomes a

00:06:42.170 --> 00:06:42.180
playing all of a sudden becomes a
 

00:06:42.180 --> 00:06:44.839
playing all of a sudden becomes a
three-dimensional space okay so if I add

00:06:44.839 --> 00:06:44.849
three-dimensional space okay so if I add
 

00:06:44.849 --> 00:06:46.520
three-dimensional space okay so if I add
an extra dimension to the whole picture

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:46.530
an extra dimension to the whole picture
 

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.469
an extra dimension to the whole picture
then there will be an extra dimension

00:06:48.469 --> 00:06:48.479
then there will be an extra dimension
 

00:06:48.479 --> 00:06:51.649
then there will be an extra dimension
added to this plane so in this new space

00:06:51.649 --> 00:06:51.659
added to this plane so in this new space
 

00:06:51.659 --> 00:06:54.890
added to this plane so in this new space
the bottom braid can simply jump over

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:54.900
the bottom braid can simply jump over
 

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:58.029
the bottom braid can simply jump over
the other strand in the extra dimension

00:06:58.029 --> 00:06:58.039
the other strand in the extra dimension
 

00:06:58.039 --> 00:07:00.980
the other strand in the extra dimension
so not in the three dimensions that it

00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:00.990
so not in the three dimensions that it
 

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:03.439
so not in the three dimensions that it
lived in before but when you add the

00:07:03.439 --> 00:07:03.449
lived in before but when you add the
 

00:07:03.449 --> 00:07:06.589
lived in before but when you add the
extra dimension it can jump over could

00:07:06.589 --> 00:07:06.599
extra dimension it can jump over could
 

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:08.089
extra dimension it can jump over could
you still braid your hair if you were a

00:07:08.089 --> 00:07:08.099
you still braid your hair if you were a
 

00:07:08.099 --> 00:07:10.219
you still braid your hair if you were a
four dimensional being and your hair

00:07:10.219 --> 00:07:10.229
four dimensional being and your hair
 

00:07:10.229 --> 00:07:11.659
four dimensional being and your hair
have a new property that still made

00:07:11.659 --> 00:07:11.669
have a new property that still made
 

00:07:11.669 --> 00:07:15.469
have a new property that still made
upgradable well it depends so if I

00:07:15.469 --> 00:07:15.479
upgradable well it depends so if I
 

00:07:15.479 --> 00:07:18.830
upgradable well it depends so if I
stayed the same but I was placed in four

00:07:18.830 --> 00:07:18.840
stayed the same but I was placed in four
 

00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:22.159
stayed the same but I was placed in four
dimensions then no for the reason that I

00:07:22.159 --> 00:07:22.169
dimensions then no for the reason that I
 

00:07:22.169 --> 00:07:24.439
dimensions then no for the reason that I
just told you because each strand of my

00:07:24.439 --> 00:07:24.449
just told you because each strand of my
 

00:07:24.449 --> 00:07:26.629
just told you because each strand of my
hair is basically one dimensional your D

00:07:26.629 --> 00:07:26.639
hair is basically one dimensional your D
 

00:07:26.639 --> 00:07:28.070
hair is basically one dimensional your D
and I would probably all fall apart as

00:07:28.070 --> 00:07:28.080
and I would probably all fall apart as
 

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:34.279
and I would probably all fall apart as
well but if when I was placed in four

00:07:34.279 --> 00:07:34.289
well but if when I was placed in four
 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:36.980
well but if when I was placed in four
dimensions I myself became four

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:36.990
dimensions I myself became four
 

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:39.320
dimensions I myself became four
dimensional and my strands of hair

00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:39.330
dimensional and my strands of hair
 

00:07:39.330 --> 00:07:42.649
dimensional and my strands of hair
became two-dimensional then I could so I

00:07:42.649 --> 00:07:42.659
became two-dimensional then I could so I
 

00:07:42.659 --> 00:07:45.469
became two-dimensional then I could so I
said braids in four dimensions aren't

00:07:45.469 --> 00:07:45.479
said braids in four dimensions aren't
 

00:07:45.479 --> 00:07:47.629
said braids in four dimensions aren't
interesting and now I will show you why

00:07:47.629 --> 00:07:47.639
interesting and now I will show you why
 

00:07:47.639 --> 00:07:49.370
interesting and now I will show you why
they are

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:49.380
they are
 

00:07:49.380 --> 00:07:52.580

the key is that it's not enough to braid

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:52.590
the key is that it's not enough to braid
 

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.190
the key is that it's not enough to braid
strings I just showed you that if you're

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:55.200
strings I just showed you that if you're
 

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:56.990
strings I just showed you that if you're
braiding strings that can always be

00:07:56.990 --> 00:07:57.000
braiding strings that can always be
 

00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.270
braiding strings that can always be
undone in the fourth dimension so I have

00:07:59.270 --> 00:07:59.280
undone in the fourth dimension so I have
 

00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.070
undone in the fourth dimension so I have
to show you what to braid instead you

00:08:01.070 --> 00:08:01.080
to show you what to braid instead you
 

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.930
to show you what to braid instead you
can braid something besides strings to

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:02.940
can braid something besides strings to
 

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:04.730
can braid something besides strings to
show you that first I like to show you a

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:04.740
show you that first I like to show you a
 

00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.090
show you that first I like to show you a
different way to see just regular braids

00:08:08.090 --> 00:08:08.100
different way to see just regular braids
 

00:08:08.100 --> 00:08:10.400
different way to see just regular braids
in three dimensions and since we were

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:10.410
in three dimensions and since we were
 

00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:13.310
in three dimensions and since we were
talking about ends so you have some ends

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:13.320
talking about ends so you have some ends
 

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:16.160
talking about ends so you have some ends
and I'm making a movie in which the ends

00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:16.170
and I'm making a movie in which the ends
 

00:08:16.170 --> 00:08:18.230
and I'm making a movie in which the ends
start out in a neat straight line and

00:08:18.230 --> 00:08:18.240
start out in a neat straight line and
 

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.280
start out in a neat straight line and
then they crawl around and eventually

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:22.290
then they crawl around and eventually
 

00:08:22.290 --> 00:08:25.070
then they crawl around and eventually
they get back to the neat straight line

00:08:25.070 --> 00:08:25.080
they get back to the neat straight line
 

00:08:25.080 --> 00:08:27.710
they get back to the neat straight line
I will film them doing this and then

00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:27.720
I will film them doing this and then
 

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:29.690
I will film them doing this and then
there will be a whole bunch of frames I

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:29.700
there will be a whole bunch of frames I
 

00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:32.600
there will be a whole bunch of frames I
could imagine just stacking the frames

00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:32.610
could imagine just stacking the frames
 

00:08:32.610 --> 00:08:36.560
could imagine just stacking the frames
in the first frame I have the four ends

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:36.570
in the first frame I have the four ends
 

00:08:36.570 --> 00:08:39.140
in the first frame I have the four ends
in a straight line and then in the

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:39.150
in a straight line and then in the
 

00:08:39.150 --> 00:08:42.020
in a straight line and then in the
second frame they will have moved

00:08:42.020 --> 00:08:42.030
second frame they will have moved
 

00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:45.230
second frame they will have moved
slightly in the third frame they will

00:08:45.230 --> 00:08:45.240
slightly in the third frame they will
 

00:08:45.240 --> 00:08:47.600
slightly in the third frame they will
have moved again and then so on and so

00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:47.610
have moved again and then so on and so
 

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.360
have moved again and then so on and so
forth until I get to the last frame in

00:08:50.360 --> 00:08:50.370
forth until I get to the last frame in
 

00:08:50.370 --> 00:08:54.080
forth until I get to the last frame in
which they are again in a straight line

00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:54.090
which they are again in a straight line
 

00:08:54.090 --> 00:08:58.700

and in between if I trace all the ways
 

00:08:58.710 --> 00:09:02.120
and in between if I trace all the ways
that they had moved what we got there is

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:02.130
that they had moved what we got there is
 

00:09:02.130 --> 00:09:04.670
that they had moved what we got there is
a braid okay so if I make a movie of

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:04.680
a braid okay so if I make a movie of
 

00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:08.300
a braid okay so if I make a movie of
ants crawling on a plane then that's the

00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:08.310
ants crawling on a plane then that's the
 

00:09:08.310 --> 00:09:11.480
ants crawling on a plane then that's the
same as having a braid in 3d just by

00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:11.490
same as having a braid in 3d just by
 

00:09:11.490 --> 00:09:14.240
same as having a braid in 3d just by
stacking all the movie frames on top of

00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:14.250
stacking all the movie frames on top of
 

00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:16.760
stacking all the movie frames on top of
each other so what does my previous

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:16.770
each other so what does my previous
 

00:09:16.770 --> 00:09:19.910
each other so what does my previous
statement mean in this context so my

00:09:19.910 --> 00:09:19.920
statement mean in this context so my
 

00:09:19.920 --> 00:09:22.220
statement mean in this context so my
previous statement is that braids in

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:22.230
previous statement is that braids in
 

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.410
previous statement is that braids in
four dimensions are uninteresting what

00:09:24.410 --> 00:09:24.420
four dimensions are uninteresting what
 

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:26.270
four dimensions are uninteresting what
would be braids in four dimensions well

00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:26.280
would be braids in four dimensions well
 

00:09:26.280 --> 00:09:30.040
would be braids in four dimensions well
it would be like flies flying around in

00:09:30.040 --> 00:09:30.050
it would be like flies flying around in
 

00:09:30.050 --> 00:09:32.510
it would be like flies flying around in
three-dimensional space and then I make

00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:32.520
three-dimensional space and then I make
 

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:36.020
three-dimensional space and then I make
a movie of the flies flying around and I

00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:36.030
a movie of the flies flying around and I
 

00:09:36.030 --> 00:09:37.970
a movie of the flies flying around and I
stack them on top of each other so the

00:09:37.970 --> 00:09:37.980
stack them on top of each other so the
 

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:40.820
stack them on top of each other so the
fourth dimension is the time and the

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:40.830
fourth dimension is the time and the
 

00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.420
fourth dimension is the time and the
frames of the movie each frame is a

00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:43.430
frames of the movie each frame is a
 

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:45.320
frames of the movie each frame is a
three-dimensional thing because they are

00:09:45.320 --> 00:09:45.330
three-dimensional thing because they are
 

00:09:45.330 --> 00:09:48.530
three-dimensional thing because they are
flying in space so what I get is graded

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:48.540
flying in space so what I get is graded
 

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:51.110
flying in space so what I get is graded
strings and four dimensions so that is

00:09:51.110 --> 00:09:51.120
strings and four dimensions so that is
 

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:53.030
strings and four dimensions so that is
still uninteresting to a mathematician

00:09:53.030 --> 00:09:53.040
still uninteresting to a mathematician
 

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.920
still uninteresting to a mathematician
for the same reason why it's

00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:54.930
for the same reason why it's
 

00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:57.410
for the same reason why it's
uninteresting to you because it wouldn't

00:09:57.410 --> 00:09:57.420
uninteresting to you because it wouldn't
 

00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.090
uninteresting to you because it wouldn't
fold your hand it wouldn't hold your

fold your hand it wouldn't hold your

hair together it can always be undone so

00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:01.590
hair together it can always be undone so
 

00:10:01.590 --> 00:10:02.800
hair together it can always be undone so
there's no very

there's no very
 

00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:04.180
there's no very
interesting analysis that can be done

00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:04.190
interesting analysis that can be done
 

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.490
interesting analysis that can be done
the only point I want to get out of it

00:10:06.490 --> 00:10:06.500
the only point I want to get out of it
 

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:08.830
the only point I want to get out of it
is that you can think of this

00:10:08.830 --> 00:10:08.840
is that you can think of this
 

00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:11.019
is that you can think of this
uninteresting object as a movie about

00:10:11.019 --> 00:10:11.029
uninteresting object as a movie about
 

00:10:11.029 --> 00:10:13.450
uninteresting object as a movie about
Flash and now I can tell you what the

00:10:13.450 --> 00:10:13.460
Flash and now I can tell you what the
 

00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:15.580
Flash and now I can tell you what the
interesting object is instead of making

00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:15.590
interesting object is instead of making
 

00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:18.100
interesting object is instead of making
a movie about flies you could make a

00:10:18.100 --> 00:10:18.110
a movie about flies you could make a
 

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:20.769
a movie about flies you could make a
movie about other things moving around

00:10:20.769 --> 00:10:20.779
movie about other things moving around
 

00:10:20.779 --> 00:10:24.160
movie about other things moving around
in three-dimensional space the one that

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:24.170
in three-dimensional space the one that
 

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:27.190
in three-dimensional space the one that
I actually think about in my research is

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:27.200
I actually think about in my research is
 

00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:29.800
I actually think about in my research is
rings flying around in three-dimensional

00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:29.810
rings flying around in three-dimensional
 

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:31.810
rings flying around in three-dimensional
space so if you have some rings they

00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:31.820
space so if you have some rings they
 

00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:35.050
space so if you have some rings they
start out in a straight line and then

00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:35.060
start out in a straight line and then
 

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:39.310
start out in a straight line and then
they can fly around in three-dimensional

00:10:39.310 --> 00:10:39.320
they can fly around in three-dimensional
 

00:10:39.320 --> 00:10:42.640
they can fly around in three-dimensional
space and eventually get back to the

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:42.650
space and eventually get back to the
 

00:10:42.650 --> 00:10:44.800
space and eventually get back to the
same position if I make a movie about

00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:44.810
same position if I make a movie about
 

00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:46.750
same position if I make a movie about
this and take all these

00:10:46.750 --> 00:10:46.760
this and take all these
 

00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:48.970
this and take all these
three-dimensional movies frames and

00:10:48.970 --> 00:10:48.980
three-dimensional movies frames and
 

00:10:48.980 --> 00:10:51.040
three-dimensional movies frames and
stack them on top of each other in four

00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:51.050
stack them on top of each other in four
 

00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.380
stack them on top of each other in four
dimensions I get something like a braid

00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:53.390
dimensions I get something like a braid
 

00:10:53.390 --> 00:10:56.110
dimensions I get something like a braid
so your breathing tubes as opposed to

00:10:56.110 --> 00:10:56.120
so your breathing tubes as opposed to
 

00:10:56.120 --> 00:10:59.590
so your breathing tubes as opposed to
rings tubes are two-dimensional so

00:10:59.590 --> 00:10:59.600
rings tubes are two-dimensional so
 

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.360
rings tubes are two-dimensional so
you're braiding two-dimensional things

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:01.370
you're braiding two-dimensional things
 

00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:04.360
you're braiding two-dimensional things
in four-dimensional space so wire rings

00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:04.370
in four-dimensional space so wire rings
 

00:11:04.370 --> 00:11:06.280
in four-dimensional space so wire rings
more interesting than flies I have some

00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:06.290
more interesting than flies I have some
 

00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.400
more interesting than flies I have some
slightly mangled rings here so if they

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:09.410
slightly mangled rings here so if they
 

00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:13.360
slightly mangled rings here so if they
just fly around not interacting ever

00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:13.370
just fly around not interacting ever
 

00:11:13.370 --> 00:11:15.640
just fly around not interacting ever
they are exactly like flies on the air

00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:15.650
they are exactly like flies on the air
 

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:19.450
they are exactly like flies on the air
boring but since they are rings they

00:11:19.450 --> 00:11:19.460
boring but since they are rings they
 

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:21.820
boring but since they are rings they
have a hole inside something they can do

00:11:21.820 --> 00:11:21.830
have a hole inside something they can do
 

00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:25.090
have a hole inside something they can do
is fly right through each other and

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:25.100
is fly right through each other and
 

00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:26.670
is fly right through each other and
flying through each other that's

00:11:26.670 --> 00:11:26.680
flying through each other that's
 

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:29.440
flying through each other that's
fundamentally different from just being

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:29.450
fundamentally different from just being
 

00:11:29.450 --> 00:11:31.780
fundamentally different from just being
flies and that's what makes these

00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:31.790
flies and that's what makes these
 

00:11:31.790 --> 00:11:34.810
flies and that's what makes these
braided tubes something interesting as

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:34.820
braided tubes something interesting as
 

00:11:34.820 --> 00:11:39.280
braided tubes something interesting as
opposed to just braided strings which in

00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:39.290
opposed to just braided strings which in
 

00:11:39.290 --> 00:11:41.440
opposed to just braided strings which in
four dimensions are uninteresting so

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:41.450
four dimensions are uninteresting so
 

00:11:41.450 --> 00:11:43.810
four dimensions are uninteresting so
they are allowed to expand and and get

00:11:43.810 --> 00:11:43.820
they are allowed to expand and and get
 

00:11:43.820 --> 00:11:46.120
they are allowed to expand and and get
smaller and bigger as they need to

00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:46.130
smaller and bigger as they need to
 

00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:47.860
smaller and bigger as they need to
further purpose of flying through each

00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:47.870
further purpose of flying through each
 

00:11:47.870 --> 00:11:49.720
further purpose of flying through each

they create the analogous kind of

they create the analogous kind of
tangled mess kind of things that you can

00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:55.100
tangled mess kind of things that you can
 

00:11:55.100 --> 00:11:57.070
tangled mess kind of things that you can
move past each other right within a

00:11:57.070 --> 00:11:57.080
move past each other right within a
 

00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:59.079
move past each other right within a
braid yeah it's a tube going through

00:11:59.079 --> 00:11:59.089
braid yeah it's a tube going through
 

00:11:59.089 --> 00:12:00.970
braid yeah it's a tube going through
another tube which would be impossible

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:00.980
another tube which would be impossible
 

00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:04.000
another tube which would be impossible
in three dimensions for a tube to go

00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:04.010
in three dimensions for a tube to go
 

00:12:04.010 --> 00:12:05.350
in three dimensions for a tube to go
through another tube without

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:05.360
through another tube without
 

00:12:05.360 --> 00:12:07.449
through another tube without
intersecting it but in four dimensions

00:12:07.449 --> 00:12:07.459
intersecting it but in four dimensions
 

00:12:07.459 --> 00:12:10.030
intersecting it but in four dimensions
it's possible and it catches the same

00:12:10.030 --> 00:12:10.040
it's possible and it catches the same
 

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:12.280
it's possible and it catches the same
way that strings would catch on each

00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:12.290
way that strings would catch on each
 

00:12:12.290 --> 00:12:15.280
way that strings would catch on each
other in three dimensions can I only go

00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:15.290
other in three dimensions can I only go
 

00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:16.060
other in three dimensions can I only go
completely

00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:16.070
completely
 

00:12:16.070 --> 00:12:18.280
completely
we inside each other or can they overlap

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:18.290
we inside each other or can they overlap
 

00:12:18.290 --> 00:12:21.670
we inside each other or can they overlap
like no they can't intersect so they are

00:12:21.670 --> 00:12:21.680
like no they can't intersect so they are
 

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:24.189
like no they can't intersect so they are
still you know there you can think of

00:12:24.189 --> 00:12:24.199
still you know there you can think of
 

00:12:24.199 --> 00:12:27.579
still you know there you can think of
them as physical objects physical object

00:12:27.579 --> 00:12:27.589
them as physical objects physical object
 

00:12:27.589 --> 00:12:29.620
them as physical objects physical object
they are not phantom rings the material

00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:29.630
they are not phantom rings the material
 

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:31.540
they are not phantom rings the material
doesn't go through each other it's just

00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:31.550
doesn't go through each other it's just
 

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:34.569
doesn't go through each other it's just
the Rings flying through the hole inside

00:12:34.569 --> 00:12:34.579
the Rings flying through the hole inside
 

00:12:34.579 --> 00:12:38.769
the Rings flying through the hole inside
the other ring this you can generalize

00:12:38.769 --> 00:12:38.779
the other ring this you can generalize
 

00:12:38.779 --> 00:12:41.860
the other ring this you can generalize
to any dimensions so in three dimensions

00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:41.870
to any dimensions so in three dimensions
 

00:12:41.870 --> 00:12:45.490
to any dimensions so in three dimensions
you can braid one-dimensional string

00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:45.500
you can braid one-dimensional string
 

00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.290
you can braid one-dimensional string
with a one-dimensional string one

00:12:47.290 --> 00:12:47.300
with a one-dimensional string one
 

00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:49.480
with a one-dimensional string one
dimensions with one dimensions one plus

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:49.490
dimensions with one dimensions one plus
 

00:12:49.490 --> 00:12:51.819
dimensions with one dimensions one plus
one equals two which is three minus one

00:12:51.819 --> 00:12:51.829
one equals two which is three minus one
 

00:12:51.829 --> 00:12:54.900
one equals two which is three minus one
in four dimensions you can braid a

00:12:54.900 --> 00:12:54.910
in four dimensions you can braid a
 

00:12:54.910 --> 00:12:56.559
in four dimensions you can braid a
one-dimensional with a two-dimensional

00:12:56.559 --> 00:12:56.569
one-dimensional with a two-dimensional
 

00:12:56.569 --> 00:12:59.790
one-dimensional with a two-dimensional
so that's the fly when you take the

00:12:59.790 --> 00:12:59.800
so that's the fly when you take the
 

00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:02.470
so that's the fly when you take the
trajectory in time that is the ring when

00:13:02.470 --> 00:13:02.480
trajectory in time that is the ring when
 

00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:04.420
trajectory in time that is the ring when
you take the trajectory in time that's

00:13:04.420 --> 00:13:04.430
you take the trajectory in time that's
 

00:13:04.430 --> 00:13:07.710
you take the trajectory in time that's
three and three equals four minus one

00:13:07.710 --> 00:13:07.720
three and three equals four minus one
 

00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:11.350
three and three equals four minus one
you can also braid a two-dimensional

00:13:11.350 --> 00:13:11.360
you can also braid a two-dimensional
 

00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:12.939
you can also braid a two-dimensional
with a two-dimensional which is four

00:13:12.939 --> 00:13:12.949
with a two-dimensional which is four
 

00:13:12.949 --> 00:13:16.780
with a two-dimensional which is four
which is bigger than four minus one and

00:13:16.780 --> 00:13:16.790
which is bigger than four minus one and
 

00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:19.809
which is bigger than four minus one and
similarly in five dimensions you

00:13:19.809 --> 00:13:19.819
similarly in five dimensions you
 

00:13:19.819 --> 00:13:21.460
similarly in five dimensions you
couldn't breathe a one-dimensional with

00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:21.470
couldn't breathe a one-dimensional with
 

00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:24.009
couldn't breathe a one-dimensional with
a one-dimensional or a one-dimensional

00:13:24.009 --> 00:13:24.019
a one-dimensional or a one-dimensional
 

00:13:24.019 --> 00:13:26.079
a one-dimensional or a one-dimensional
with a two-dimensional but you could you

00:13:26.079 --> 00:13:26.089
with a two-dimensional but you could you
 

00:13:26.089 --> 00:13:29.079
with a two-dimensional but you could you
could do two with two or three with

00:13:29.079 --> 00:13:29.089
could do two with two or three with
 

00:13:29.089 --> 00:13:31.180
could do two with two or three with
three as long as dimensions of your two

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:31.190
three as long as dimensions of your two
 

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:34.569
three as long as dimensions of your two
strings add up to at least the dimension

00:13:34.569 --> 00:13:34.579
strings add up to at least the dimension
 

00:13:34.579 --> 00:13:38.170
strings add up to at least the dimension
of the containing space minus one then

00:13:38.170 --> 00:13:38.180
of the containing space minus one then
 

00:13:38.180 --> 00:13:42.280
of the containing space minus one then
you can break them together but in my

00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:42.290
you can break them together but in my
 

00:13:42.290 --> 00:13:44.980
you can break them together but in my
research I mostly think about one in two

00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:44.990
research I mostly think about one in two
 

00:13:44.990 --> 00:13:48.100
research I mostly think about one in two
dimensional things braided or tangled in

00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:48.110
dimensional things braided or tangled in
 

00:13:48.110 --> 00:13:51.069
dimensional things braided or tangled in
four dimensional space or the simplest

00:13:51.069 --> 00:13:51.079
four dimensional space or the simplest
 

00:13:51.079 --> 00:13:53.889
four dimensional space or the simplest
thing of one dimensional things braided

00:13:53.889 --> 00:13:53.899
thing of one dimensional things braided
 

00:13:53.899 --> 00:13:56.019
thing of one dimensional things braided
or tangled in three-dimensional space

00:13:56.019 --> 00:13:56.029
or tangled in three-dimensional space
 

00:13:56.029 --> 00:14:00.579
or tangled in three-dimensional space
and the relationships between them

00:14:00.579 --> 00:14:00.589
 

00:14:00.589 --> 00:14:04.009
so my favorite way of visualizing it is

00:14:04.009 --> 00:14:04.019
so my favorite way of visualizing it is
 

00:14:04.019 --> 00:14:07.069
so my favorite way of visualizing it is
is to think of it in terms of movies in

00:14:07.069 --> 00:14:07.079
is to think of it in terms of movies in
 

00:14:07.079 --> 00:14:10.220
is to think of it in terms of movies in
three dimensions and that is actually a

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:10.230
three dimensions and that is actually a
 

00:14:10.230 --> 00:14:14.060
three dimensions and that is actually a
little bit restrictive because visualize

00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:14.070
little bit restrictive because visualize
 

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:16.810
little bit restrictive because visualize
the fourth dimension is time and time

00:14:16.810 --> 00:14:16.820
the fourth dimension is time and time
 

00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:20.600
the fourth dimension is time and time
only moves forward
