00:00:00.290 --> 00:00:01.552
- [Instructor] We are now going to study

00:00:01.552 --> 00:00:04.385
the magical republic of Fitlandia,

00:00:06.519 --> 00:00:09.117
and as we often do in economics,

00:00:09.117 --> 00:00:10.869
we're going to assume that Fitlandia,

00:00:10.869 --> 00:00:13.026
which of course does not
exist in the real world,

00:00:13.026 --> 00:00:15.468
is a very simple country.

00:00:15.468 --> 00:00:17.622
It helps us create a model for it.

00:00:17.622 --> 00:00:20.745
Let's say that Fitlandia is
capable of producing two goods.

00:00:20.745 --> 00:00:23.917
It can either produce dumbbells.

00:00:23.917 --> 00:00:26.482
That's my best picture of a
dumbbell right over there,

00:00:26.482 --> 00:00:29.461
or it can produce protein bars.

00:00:29.461 --> 00:00:33.294
So this right over here,
that is a protein bar

00:00:34.541 --> 00:00:36.986
or some combination of the two.

00:00:36.986 --> 00:00:41.324
So we can draw Fitlandia's
production possibilities curve.

00:00:41.324 --> 00:00:43.356
So let me write this, PPC,

00:00:43.356 --> 00:00:46.366
production possibilities
curve for Fitlandia.

00:00:46.366 --> 00:00:47.543
Sometimes this will be referred

00:00:47.543 --> 00:00:51.042
to as a production possibility frontier,

00:00:51.042 --> 00:00:53.196
and so let me draw two axes.

00:00:53.196 --> 00:00:57.302
One for dumbbells and
one for protein bars.

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:59.833
So the vertical axis right over there,

00:00:59.833 --> 00:01:04.107
and then the horizontal
axis right over here,

00:01:04.107 --> 00:01:06.587
and we're going to assume
that everything we do,

00:01:06.587 --> 00:01:09.754
this is in thousands of tons per year,

00:01:15.422 --> 00:01:19.589
and so in the vertical axis,
we have one, two, three,

00:01:22.478 --> 00:01:26.471
four, and five, and the horizontal axis,

00:01:26.471 --> 00:01:30.013
one thousand tons per year,
two thousand tons per year,

00:01:30.013 --> 00:01:33.842
three thousand tons per year,
four thousand tons per year,

00:01:33.842 --> 00:01:36.376
and five thousand tons per year,

00:01:36.376 --> 00:01:40.245
and let's put dumbbells
in the vertical axis.

00:01:40.245 --> 00:01:42.883
Dumbbells right over here,

00:01:42.883 --> 00:01:47.689
and let's put our protein
bars in the horizontal axis,

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:49.399
and let's say we know that,

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:52.538
we're maybe the economics
minister for Fitlandia,

00:01:52.538 --> 00:01:55.144
or the secretary of commerce,
or something like that,

00:01:55.144 --> 00:01:58.889
and we know that if we put all
of our energy into dumbbells

00:01:58.889 --> 00:02:01.653
and optimally allocated our resources,

00:02:01.653 --> 00:02:04.139
we could produce five, actually,

00:02:04.139 --> 00:02:04.972
let's say we could produce

00:02:04.972 --> 00:02:08.472
four thousand tons of dumbbells in a year.

00:02:09.676 --> 00:02:11.588
We also know that well,

00:02:11.588 --> 00:02:14.194
if we wanted to produce some protein bars,

00:02:14.194 --> 00:02:15.746
we're going to have to
give up our production

00:02:15.746 --> 00:02:19.618
of some dumbbells, and so the
more protein bars we produce,

00:02:19.618 --> 00:02:24.096
we're going to produce
fewer and fewer dumbbells,

00:02:24.096 --> 00:02:26.490
and so we're going to sit on this curve

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:28.889
if we're producing as
efficiently as possible

00:02:28.889 --> 00:02:30.394
given the resources we have,

00:02:30.394 --> 00:02:33.439
and if we put all of our
resources into protein bars,

00:02:33.439 --> 00:02:35.845
we could produce three thousand tons

00:02:35.845 --> 00:02:37.916
of protein bars per year.

00:02:37.916 --> 00:02:38.749
So this right over here

00:02:38.749 --> 00:02:41.409
is our production possibilities curve.

00:02:41.409 --> 00:02:44.576
If my country is operating efficiently

00:02:45.834 --> 00:02:47.957
and all the resources are being used.

00:02:47.957 --> 00:02:48.790
When I talk about resources,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.701
I'm talking about people's
time; so my labor.

00:02:51.701 --> 00:02:55.118
I'm talking about the factories
are being fully utilized,

00:02:55.118 --> 00:02:56.865
the land, the material.

00:02:56.865 --> 00:02:58.490
Then I would sit someplace

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.562
on this production possibilities curve.

00:03:00.562 --> 00:03:01.538
Sometimes it's referred to as

00:03:01.538 --> 00:03:05.119
a productions possibility frontier

00:03:05.119 --> 00:03:09.645
because you can't go beyond
this unless something changes.

00:03:09.645 --> 00:03:12.206
We're gonna talk in a second
about why they change.

00:03:12.206 --> 00:03:14.249
So if you sit on this curve,

00:03:14.249 --> 00:03:16.849
if you sit someplace on this curve,

00:03:16.849 --> 00:03:19.085
and the country might choose
to sit at different points

00:03:19.085 --> 00:03:21.835
on this curve, this is efficient.

00:03:23.076 --> 00:03:26.164
Efficient use of the resources,

00:03:26.164 --> 00:03:28.287
and it's kind of a theoretical efficiency.

00:03:28.287 --> 00:03:31.696
In practice, almost no country can,

00:03:31.696 --> 00:03:34.828
or really no country can fully
utilize all of its resources

00:03:34.828 --> 00:03:37.024
where all of it's people are working

00:03:37.024 --> 00:03:39.382
absolutely all of the time,

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:42.099
and so in reality a
country might actually sit

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:45.763
a little bit below it's
production possibilities curve.

00:03:45.763 --> 00:03:47.958
So someplace behind it.

00:03:47.958 --> 00:03:50.238
Now what would happen, let's
say a country right over here,

00:03:50.238 --> 00:03:53.000
and this is a real, let's just
take the theoretical country

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.807
that somehow is able to
operate super-efficiently,

00:03:55.807 --> 00:03:58.618
and it's sitting on it's
productions possibility curve,

00:03:58.618 --> 00:04:00.771
or it's production possibility frontier,

00:04:00.771 --> 00:04:04.802
and let's say it were to enter
into some type of recession,

00:04:04.802 --> 00:04:07.169
where all of a sudden
some of it's population

00:04:07.169 --> 00:04:10.306
isn't able to work, so the labor pool

00:04:10.306 --> 00:04:11.648
isn't being fully utilized,

00:04:11.648 --> 00:04:14.692
what would happen to it's production?

00:04:14.692 --> 00:04:18.859
Well, it's production would
then go off the curve,

00:04:20.834 --> 00:04:24.123
and it would go to down and to the left,

00:04:24.123 --> 00:04:26.559
and so it might end up right over here.

00:04:26.559 --> 00:04:29.892
So here maybe we have some unemployment.

00:04:31.319 --> 00:04:33.637
Unemployment right over here,

00:04:33.637 --> 00:04:37.493
and so this is an
inefficient use of resources.

00:04:37.493 --> 00:04:42.288
Maybe Fitlandia gets into a
war with some other country,

00:04:42.288 --> 00:04:45.295
and that other country destroys some

00:04:45.295 --> 00:04:48.556
of their productive capability;
some of the factories,

00:04:48.556 --> 00:04:50.796
or maybe some of the people of Fitlandia

00:04:50.796 --> 00:04:53.154
decide to move someplace else.

00:04:53.154 --> 00:04:54.699
Well the what would happen?

00:04:54.699 --> 00:04:57.463
Well then your production
possibilities frontier

00:04:57.463 --> 00:04:59.170
would actually contract.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:01.000
If you have fewer factories,

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.793
or if you have a smaller population,

00:05:02.793 --> 00:05:05.395
or maybe you lose some
territory to another country,

00:05:05.395 --> 00:05:08.118
then you have fewer resources
with which to produce,

00:05:08.118 --> 00:05:10.398
and so you could end up in a scenario

00:05:10.398 --> 00:05:12.520
where your production
possibilities frontier

00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.687
contracts to something,
contracts to maybe something

00:05:17.978 --> 00:05:20.779
like this, and so this movement

00:05:20.779 --> 00:05:22.730
of the production possibilities curve,

00:05:22.730 --> 00:05:26.897
this would happen if you
have contracting resources,

00:05:31.016 --> 00:05:33.003
and likewise, most countries of course

00:05:33.003 --> 00:05:34.257
don't want to be in this situation;

00:05:34.257 --> 00:05:36.732
most countries want economic growth.

00:05:36.732 --> 00:05:40.351
An economic growth is when
you have expanding resources.

00:05:40.351 --> 00:05:42.059
So how can we get beyond this

00:05:42.059 --> 00:05:43.528
production possibilities frontier;

00:05:43.528 --> 00:05:46.536
maybe construct one that is further out?

00:05:46.536 --> 00:05:49.297
Let's say we want to get a
production possibilities frontier

00:05:49.297 --> 00:05:51.880
that looks something like this,

00:05:52.991 --> 00:05:53.824
and it doesn't have to increase

00:05:53.824 --> 00:05:55.826
both of the good proportionately.

00:05:55.826 --> 00:05:58.393
Maybe we want to get to a
production possibilities frontier

00:05:58.393 --> 00:05:59.448
that looks something like that?

00:05:59.448 --> 00:06:00.544
How could we get there?

00:06:00.544 --> 00:06:02.544
Well, there's a couple of mechanisms.

00:06:02.544 --> 00:06:05.461
One is you could have more capital.

00:06:06.615 --> 00:06:08.163
More capital.

00:06:08.163 --> 00:06:08.996
What do we mean by capital?

00:06:08.996 --> 00:06:12.140
Well, maybe we invest in
creating more factories

00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:13.559
or getting more technology.

00:06:13.559 --> 00:06:16.567
So computer-aided
things, robots, whatever,

00:06:16.567 --> 00:06:18.260
so that we could produce more

00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.760
either protein bars or dumbbells per year.

00:06:23.430 --> 00:06:27.241
Another possibility is
we have more population.

00:06:27.241 --> 00:06:30.046
More especially working population.

00:06:30.046 --> 00:06:31.842
More population.

00:06:31.842 --> 00:06:34.780
So the big takeaways here.

00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:36.401
The production possibilities curve

00:06:36.401 --> 00:06:39.409
or production possibilities
frontier for a country

00:06:39.409 --> 00:06:43.524
are the combinations of
goods that it can produce

00:06:43.524 --> 00:06:45.519
in a certain amount of time

00:06:45.519 --> 00:06:48.811
if it's using all of it's
resources completely efficiently.

00:06:48.811 --> 00:06:51.290
If it gets into some type of a recession

00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.610
or doesn't used it's
resources efficiently,

00:06:53.610 --> 00:06:56.502
then you're going to
have a production point;

00:06:56.502 --> 00:06:58.619
some kind of combination
of producing goods

00:06:58.619 --> 00:07:00.981
that sits under or behind

00:07:00.981 --> 00:07:02.857
your production possibilities frontier;

00:07:02.857 --> 00:07:05.137
maybe there, or there, or there,

00:07:05.137 --> 00:07:07.173
and maybe as you come out of
a recession you might get,

00:07:07.173 --> 00:07:10.834
again, closer to your production
possibilities frontier.

00:07:10.834 --> 00:07:14.865
Now, there's also ways you
can shift the entire frontier.

00:07:14.865 --> 00:07:17.796
The entire frontier, or the
production possibilities curve,

00:07:17.796 --> 00:07:20.768
can contract is you have
contracting resources,

00:07:20.768 --> 00:07:25.327
favorites that are bombed in
a war, net outward migration,

00:07:25.327 --> 00:07:28.830
or your production possibilities
frontier can expand.

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:30.253
If you have more population,

00:07:30.253 --> 00:07:33.221
more people who could be there
to work to produce goods,

00:07:33.221 --> 00:07:35.738
more capital, more factories, more land,

00:07:35.738 --> 00:07:39.150
more material with which to produce goods,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:42.368
and so you can imagine most
countries want to do this,

00:07:42.368 --> 00:07:43.953
and this notion of expanding

00:07:43.953 --> 00:07:46.262
your production possibilities frontier,

00:07:46.262 --> 00:07:49.929
this is what we refer
to as economic growth.
