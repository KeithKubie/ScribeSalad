00:00:00.199 --> 00:00:04.180
Hi, I’m Emily Graslie, and welcome to season
two of Crash Course Big History.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:08.019
In the first 10 episodes of Big History, we
followed the history of the Universe from

00:00:08.019 --> 00:00:09.730
the Big Bang into the Deep Future.

00:00:09.730 --> 00:00:12.820
The theme of this season is “Why Does This
Matter?”

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:18.210
As fascinating as the tale of 13.8 billion
years is – from the vast cosmos to ancient

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:22.460
life on Earth – one has to wonder why learning
about this history is relevant to our own

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:24.420
fleeting lives in this world.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.930
You don’t exactly need to know about the
Big Bang to fill out your tax returns.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:33.600
But the reason we learn big history is the
same reason we learn any history at all.

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.020
History matures us, seasons our attitudes,
and enriches our perspectives.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:42.650
If we read enough human history, going back
thousands of years, we live a thousand lives.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:45.620
If we don’t read history, we live only one.

00:00:45.620 --> 00:00:47.690
Let’s take that thought one step further.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:52.350
Never mind the past 5,000 years of written
history, or even the past 250,000 years that

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.880
human beings have existed on the planet.

00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:59.300
By traversing the crash and thunder of the
cosmos, to the tooth and claw of the evolutionary

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.230
epic, we are transported across billions of
years.

00:01:02.230 --> 00:01:06.299
In a world that has learned so much about
the cosmos, and a humanity that grows ever

00:01:06.299 --> 00:01:10.979
more closely interwoven in the 21st century,
it pays to know the history of the Universe

00:01:10.979 --> 00:01:16.200
and our planet as well as we know, say, the
past 200 years of our national histories.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:20.700
Learn about Big History, and hopefully the
world around you will appear as one long continuum

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:25.869
to which you belong, indivisible and unbroken
since the Big Bang, with an underlying pattern

00:01:25.869 --> 00:01:27.490
that unites it all.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.880
Human to human, and humanity to the Universe.

00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:37.109
It is a great leap forward into a wider world.

00:01:37.109 --> 00:01:43.770
INTRO
In the Big Bang episode of Crash Course Big

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:47.889
History, we learned about how our view of
the Universe evolved in the early 20th century,

00:01:47.889 --> 00:01:51.899
leading into how our view of the Universe
continues to evolve with every fascinating

00:01:51.899 --> 00:01:53.509
theory and new discovery.

00:01:53.509 --> 00:01:58.130
One such theory is cosmic inflation, a theory
about what happened a split second after the

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:59.130
Big Bang.

00:01:59.130 --> 00:02:03.490
It was originally devised in the 1980s by
Alan Guth, to explain why the early Universe

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.549
was so smooth and stable.

00:02:05.549 --> 00:02:11.260
At approximately 10 to the power of negative
35 to negative 32 seconds, the Universe expanded

00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:16.010
rapidly from being about the size of a quantum
particle, to the size of a grapefruit.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:18.129
This is stupendously fast.

00:02:18.129 --> 00:02:22.180
Even though the Universe is expanding fast
today, it’s still way slower than it was.

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.540
If a grapefruit-sized universe expanded at
the same speed as during cosmic inflation,

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:31.590
in another split second, it would be the size
of our current Universe, about 93 billion

00:02:31.590 --> 00:02:32.840
light years across.

00:02:32.840 --> 00:02:36.489
If the early Universe had expanded at its
slower, present day rate, gravity would have

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:40.280
been too strong and sucked more clumps of
matter and energy together, and the Universe

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:41.560
would not be as evenly distributed.

00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:46.480
There would be huge inequalities, enormous
heavy chunks of energy that are billions of

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:47.480
light years across.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.030
But the Universe expanded so fast during cosmic
inflation that it was smoothed out, with no

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:54.680
huge chunks of matter and energy anywhere.

00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:59.520
Instead we see a largely homogenous Universe
with just a smattering of tiny unequal wrinkles

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:00.560
that created stars.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.090
And that’s another reason why cosmic inflation
was so important.

00:03:04.090 --> 00:03:08.719
When the Universe was still very, very small,
at the quantum scale, tiny fluctuations were

00:03:08.719 --> 00:03:10.819
popping in and out of existence.

00:03:10.819 --> 00:03:14.239
These tiny blips of energy usually don’t
affect the physics of the larger world.

00:03:14.239 --> 00:03:18.420
But, during inflation, they were suddenly
clear when the Universe became big, causing

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:21.109
slight inequalities in matter and energy.

00:03:21.109 --> 00:03:24.580
These wrinkles created all the complexity
that was to follow.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.690
Without these unequal distributions of energy,
there wouldn’t have been enough energy for

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:32.500
stars to burn, for supernovae to explode,
for planets to form, for life to exist, and

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:33.900
for us to be here.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:37.709
We are the children of those tiny wrinkles,
and the events that happened during cosmic

00:03:37.709 --> 00:03:41.980
inflation were the bedrock of the next 13.8
billion years.

00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:46.129
Know this part of the story, and you know
where you came from, in the most extreme sense

00:03:46.129 --> 00:03:47.129
of the phrase.

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:50.989
A second theory holds that cosmic inflation
may imply something curious about our Universe

00:03:50.989 --> 00:03:55.900
that has become known as the eternal inflation
hypothesis, originally developed by Paul Steinhardt.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.510
Let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:04:01.200
According to eternal inflation,
the cosmic inflation that happened in a tiny,

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:06.150
tiny sliver of a second may still be going
on, for billions and billions of years, elsewhere

00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:07.150
in the Universe.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:11.790
Our cosmic bubble, which is 93 billion light
years across, is no longer in a state of eternal

00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:12.930
inflation.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:17.200
The Universe continues to expand, and even
accelerate in that expansion, but not quite

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:19.000
at the breakneck speed of inflation.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:23.970
The eternal inflation hypothesis implies that,
within the sea of eternal inflation, new bubbles

00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:25.910
are popping up all the time.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.830
Other universes in a multiverse!

00:04:27.830 --> 00:04:30.720
Our fundamental laws of physics formed during
inflation.

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:34.140
It is highly conceivable that other sets of
fundamental laws would govern these other

00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:38.060
universes, and these laws and rules would
be completely foreign to our own.

00:04:38.060 --> 00:04:42.220
And there is a staggering number of possible
sets of physical laws, about 10 to the power

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:43.220
of 500.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.340
That’s a 1 with 500 zeros.

00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:50.000
And that’s not the number of other universes
in a multiverse, but the possible set of rules

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.470
on which an almost infinite number of universes
could operate.

00:04:53.470 --> 00:04:57.570
Even when the cosmic bubbles that come into
existence in that vast inflationary sea operate

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:00.500
on the same rules, they can have completely
different outcomes.

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.780
It’s possible the outcomes are similar,
but slightly different to ours.

00:05:03.780 --> 00:05:04.780
1.

00:05:04.780 --> 00:05:08.280
A universe out there may exist where you watch
this video approximately 30 seconds later.

00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:09.280
2.

00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.140
Or a universe out there may exist where I
was never born.

00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.140
3.

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:15.810
A universe may exist where everything is made
out of diamonds or pizza or something completely

00:05:15.810 --> 00:05:17.030
different from atoms.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:18.030
4.

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:21.220
And many universes would exist without any
stars or forms of complexity at all.

00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:23.680
Dead universes, where… everything is dead.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.700
Thanks Thought Bubble.

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:28.940
So, from here, physicists have postulated
that the behaviour of Universes may operate

00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:34.140
under some form of “natural selection”
like species do in nature - but for the cosmos.

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:38.400
By some variable or another, some universes
make it into existence, and some do not.

00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:44.400
Or, more mind-bogglingly, that certain universes
give rise to forms of extremely complex, intelligent,

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:48.850
and powerful life that over time gain the
ability to create and shape new universes,

00:05:48.850 --> 00:05:51.340
in a form of cosmic artificial selection.

00:05:51.340 --> 00:05:54.160
Sort of like how we breed different kinds
of dogs or pigeons.

00:05:54.160 --> 00:05:57.990
All of this is truly “out there” but that’s
how our view of the Universe continues to

00:05:57.990 --> 00:05:58.990
evolve.

00:05:58.990 --> 00:06:03.720
The Big Bang theory might have seemed preposterous
to most scientists 150 years ago.

00:06:03.720 --> 00:06:07.630
Give us another 1000 years of scientific advancement,
and who knows what our picture of the Universe

00:06:07.630 --> 00:06:08.630
may look like.

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:13.431
As it is, eternal inflation implies that our
cosmic bubble, already a massive 93 billion

00:06:13.431 --> 00:06:18.050
light years across, may actually be a very
tiny bubble indeed, in a giant cosmic ocean

00:06:18.050 --> 00:06:21.370
known as the multiverse that is just teeming
with other bubbles.

00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:25.130
As furiously as scientists are working at
unravelling the beginnings of our Universe,

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.280
it has remained a very curious question about
how the Universe will “end” -- whatever

00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:32.310
end means when you’re talking about something
infinite.

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.960
For a long time, the most intuitive and prevailing
theory was the Big Bounce.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:40.370
That is, the expansion of the Universe continues
to be slowed down by the force of gravity.

00:06:40.370 --> 00:06:45.650
Eventually, many billions upon billions of
years from now, the Universe begins to contract.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:50.060
Gravity sucks everything, all matter, all
energy, back into the singularity from which

00:06:50.060 --> 00:06:51.060
it sprang.

00:06:51.060 --> 00:06:52.060
The immense pressure that forms that singularity
forces everything out again in yet another

00:06:52.060 --> 00:06:53.060
Big Bang.

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.060
And the whole cycle begins anew.

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.060
Expanding, contracting, over and over and
over.

00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.060
Hence the name: Big Bounce.

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:57.060
And it makes logical sense, right?

00:06:57.060 --> 00:06:58.060
After all, what goes up, must come down.

00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.060
And there is another appeal to the theory.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:00.060
That of birth, death, and rebirth.

00:07:00.060 --> 00:07:02.200
A circle of life, not just for nature and
the characters of the Lion King, but one for

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:03.680
the entire Universe.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:08.030
This is by far the most cheerful and pleasing
scenario for the end of the Universe.

00:07:08.030 --> 00:07:11.120
And, alas, now the least likely one.

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.340
The Big Bounce presumes that eventually the
expansion of the Universe will slow down.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:17.770
But, we now know it’s not slowing down.

00:07:17.770 --> 00:07:18.930
It’s accelerating.

00:07:18.930 --> 00:07:22.800
There are many hypotheses about why, one of
the most prominent being the influence of

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:24.530
the mysterious force of dark energy.

00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:26.920
So, there are two more likely scenarios.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:28.380
The first is the Big Rip.

00:07:28.380 --> 00:07:32.870
If the expansion of the Universe continues
to accelerate at an insanely fast rate, then

00:07:32.870 --> 00:07:36.080
the distances between things would become
virtually infinite.

00:07:36.080 --> 00:07:39.800
This means the forces that hold the Universe
together would be destroyed.

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:43.900
The gravity that holds the stars in the galaxy
together would be too weak and the Milky Way

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.050
would fly apart.

00:07:45.050 --> 00:07:47.510
The planets would be ripped away from the
Sun.

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:51.350
Eventually the strong and weak nuclear forces
that hold together atoms would be shorn apart

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.350
as well.

00:07:52.350 --> 00:07:55.050
The scariest part of this scenario is how
soon it could happen.

00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:59.930
Even within 10 or 20 billion years, which
implies the Universe is roughly middle-aged.

00:07:59.930 --> 00:08:04.000
The final scenario, and currently the most
likely, is one that we covered in episode

00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.820
10 of season one of Crash Course Big History:
Heat Death or the Big Freeze.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:12.640
In this scenario, the Universe continues to
expand for trillions upon trillions of years

00:08:12.640 --> 00:08:15.760
till all forms of complexity exhaust themselves
and break down.

00:08:15.760 --> 00:08:16.760
Stars flicker out, matter dissolves back into
energy, and the Universe becomes an evenly

00:08:16.760 --> 00:08:17.760
distributed weak ball of energy.

00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:18.760
The inequalities in energy created during
inflation finally disappear.

00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.200
While not the most cheerful end to our story,
it is decidedly less violent than the Big

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:21.200
Rip.

00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:24.490
And it gives complexity in the Universe a
great deal more time to exist - on the scale

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:26.580
of trillions of years.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:30.450
Time and more research will tell whether the
Big Rip or the Big Freeze is more likely.

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:34.450
Keep your eye on the experts as they continue
to update you on the Universe’s most terrifying

00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:35.750
weather forecast.

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:39.820
Cloudy with a chance of absolute zero, or
windy with a possibility of a vicious atom

00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:41.150
shredding later in the afternoon?

00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:46.422
Finally, a last theory asks if the Universe
is even real, or is it a simulation that our

00:08:46.422 --> 00:08:48.020
minds are inhabiting?

00:08:48.020 --> 00:08:52.460
This is actually the subject of some very
interesting speculations by scientists and

00:08:52.460 --> 00:08:54.020
philosophers, like Nick Bostrom.

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.620
Just think about how far video games have
come since the 1980s.

00:08:57.620 --> 00:09:00.460
Extend that rate of progress another 500 years.

00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.740
A simulated Universe isn’t so fanciful on
that scale.

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:06.880
According to Bostrom, one of the following
statements must be true:

00:09:06.880 --> 00:09:09.390
* Either such total simulations are impossible
to create.

00:09:09.390 --> 00:09:13.900
* Or, it is possible to create them but such
an advanced society would put that computational

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.070
power to better use.

00:09:15.070 --> 00:09:19.680
* Or, they are possible to create, advanced
societies do create them, and as a result

00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:23.870
there is a high likelihood we are currently
living in a simulation rather than a base

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:24.870
reality.

00:09:24.870 --> 00:09:25.870
Why?

00:09:25.870 --> 00:09:29.960
Because, as Elon Musk puts it, given the rapid
rate of technological advancements in virtual

00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.820
reality, if we are one day going to create
those simulations anyway, the odds of us existing

00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.980
in the base reality that produces them really
low.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:41.360
But does a simulation reflect the outside
Universe that created it?

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.550
Or is the simulation a made-up, sort of fantasy
reality?

00:09:44.550 --> 00:09:49.320
If it is the latter it would explain why physical
laws only make sense to a certain point and

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.620
why, when we get down to the scale of quantum
physics, things seem so much more unpredictable.

00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:57.960
In a way, the pixels “blur” when we look
that closely at the screen.

00:09:57.960 --> 00:10:02.010
However this may just be a convenient explanation
to otherwise much more puzzling questions

00:10:02.010 --> 00:10:03.580
about quantum physics.

00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:05.790
It is, perhaps, a bit too convenient.

00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:07.590
But intriguing all the same.

00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:10.880
In the 21st century, science has advanced
by leaps and bounds.

00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.830
Humanity meanwhile is becoming more interdependent
and in need of a common story.

00:10:14.830 --> 00:10:18.610
Our evolving view of the Universe continues
to form the bedrock of that story, and as

00:10:18.610 --> 00:10:22.590
that view changes, so too will the view of
ourselves as a part of the grand unfolding

00:10:22.590 --> 00:10:26.010
tale of 13.8 billion years.

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:50.760
Thanks for watching, see you next time.
