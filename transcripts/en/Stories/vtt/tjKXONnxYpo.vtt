DAVID LITT: I'll never
forget the first speech

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:07.410
I wrote for the president where
it was a speech he delivered

00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:08.309
in Puerto Rico.

00:00:08.309 --> 00:00:09.892
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: Buenos tardes.

00:00:09.892 --> 00:00:10.870
[CROWD CHEERS]

00:00:10.870 --> 00:00:13.660
DAVID LITT: I remember thinking
how totally bizarre that was.

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:16.076
As a speechwriter, you're
always recognizing that it's not

00:00:16.076 --> 00:00:17.370
really my idea, right?

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:20.960
It's inspired by President
Obama, but just the fact

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.640
that you can sit
down and be part

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:25.610
of that is totally surreal.

00:00:25.610 --> 00:00:27.507
And it never stops
being surreal.

00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:33.090
LAURA LING: You were
just 24 years old when

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.510
you started at the White House.

00:00:34.510 --> 00:00:35.784
How did that come about?

00:00:35.784 --> 00:00:37.950
DAVID LITT: I did not mean
to become a speechwriter.

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.370
I didn't really mean to go in to
politics or anything like that.

00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:44.390
I was on a plane and we had
just begun our initial descent

00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:47.910
and I was sort of channel
surfing on the free airplane

00:00:47.910 --> 00:00:48.840
cable.

00:00:48.840 --> 00:00:51.710
I saw this candidate
who I had heard of

00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:53.790
but didn't know a lot
about named Barack Obama.

00:00:53.790 --> 00:00:57.735
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: They said-- they

00:00:57.735 --> 00:00:59.760
said this day would never come.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.465
[CROWD CHEERS]

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:03.340
DAVID LITT: By the time
that speech was over,

00:01:03.340 --> 00:01:04.298
I was like, never mind.

00:01:04.298 --> 00:01:06.410
Whatever he's doing-- I
want to be a part of that.

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.392
I was totally awestruck.

00:01:08.392 --> 00:01:10.100
It was really one of
those moments where,

00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:11.600
like, by the time
we hit the tarmac,

00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:13.260
I was on a totally
different life path.

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:16.360
And that doesn't happen a lot,
but it was a heck of a speech.

00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:17.860
PRESIDENT BARACK
OBAMA: You did this

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:24.330
because you believed so deeply
in the most American of ideas--

00:01:24.330 --> 00:01:27.600
that in the face
of impossible odds,

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.332
people who love this
country can change it.

00:01:31.332 --> 00:01:33.457
[CROWD APPLAUDS]

00:01:33.457 --> 00:01:36.040
LAURA LING: What are some of the
biggest challenges in helping

00:01:36.040 --> 00:01:39.647
to craft a speech for the most
powerful person on the planet?

00:01:39.647 --> 00:01:41.980
DAVID LITT: You have to realize
how high the stakes are.

00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:44.780
We would write speeches
knowing that there

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:47.300
are people whose full-time
job is to pick apart

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:49.070
every single word
the president says

00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:51.420
and sometimes just to take
things out of context.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:54.480
And that can be
incredibly intimidating.

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.050
LAURA LING: How do you
even get started working

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:58.640
on a speech for the president?

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.350
What's your process?

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:03.630
DAVID LITT: If I really didn't
know what I wanted to write,

00:02:03.630 --> 00:02:05.216
I would try saying it instead.

00:02:05.216 --> 00:02:06.590
Speeches aren't
meant to be read.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.810
They're meant to be heard.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.639
And so if I felt
like I could start

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:14.560
to finish make that argument
in my own words just talking

00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:17.300
to myself, then I could go back
and begin to shape it in a way

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.260
where it would make
sense for the president.

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:21.509
LAURA LING: What have been
your sources of inspiration

00:02:21.509 --> 00:02:23.470
when you're going
through this process?

00:02:23.470 --> 00:02:24.886
DAVID LITT: Sometimes
what I would

00:02:24.886 --> 00:02:28.010
do is I would go on YouTube and
pull up that video of that Iowa

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.470
speech from 2008 and hit play.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:34.070
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: They
said this day would never come.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.970
[AUDIENCE CHEERS]

00:02:34.970 --> 00:02:36.580
DAVID LITT:
Rewatching those words

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:39.530
and feeling that
sense of both power

00:02:39.530 --> 00:02:41.880
and responsibility
keeps you going

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:45.060
when you wonder whether it's
all making a difference.

00:02:45.060 --> 00:02:47.280
I worked on the Obama
campaign in 2008

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.017
and all of my
volunteers, when I left,

00:02:49.017 --> 00:02:50.475
they took one of
those hope posters

00:02:50.475 --> 00:02:51.864
and on the back
in cardboard they

00:02:51.864 --> 00:02:53.030
all just signed their names.

00:02:53.030 --> 00:02:55.260
And so I had a sort
of face the other way

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:56.994
where the hope side
was against the wall

00:02:56.994 --> 00:02:58.410
so that I could
see all the names.

00:02:58.410 --> 00:03:01.970
It was just this reminder
that what I was doing

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.330
was not just about my job.

00:03:04.330 --> 00:03:06.100
It was not just even
about the president.

00:03:06.100 --> 00:03:08.600
It was about people
in places like the one

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.820
where I had worked.

00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:12.150
For me, really,
all of my rituals

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:15.610
are about trying to recapture
that feeling I had in 2008,

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:18.944
to put you back in that mindset
when you're 21, 22 years old

00:03:18.944 --> 00:03:21.110
and you're absolutely sure
you can change the world,

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:23.026
and you're pretty sure
you can do it tomorrow.

00:03:26.414 --> 00:03:28.580
LAURA LING: You've worked
on a number of White House

00:03:28.580 --> 00:03:30.200
correspondent dinner
speeches which

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.570
are known for highlighting
the president's humor.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.840
How has comedy
been a tool for you

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.372
in terms of getting a
political message out?

00:03:41.372 --> 00:03:43.330
DAVID LITT: Well, one of
the interesting things

00:03:43.330 --> 00:03:45.420
over the last eight
years is getting

00:03:45.420 --> 00:03:48.700
people's attention has become
harder and harder and harder.

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.410
I wrote some speeches on climate
change that I'm very proud of,

00:03:51.410 --> 00:03:53.120
but they didn't have
a huge audience.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:56.490
We did something with
Luther, the anger translator,

00:03:56.490 --> 00:03:59.140
and President Obama got really
upset over climate change

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:02.620
deniers in Congress, and
that had 40 million views

00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:03.440
on Facebook.

00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.930
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Rising
seas, more violent storms--

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:08.583
LUTHER: You got
mosquitoes, sweaty people

00:04:08.583 --> 00:04:10.552
on the train stinking it up.

00:04:10.552 --> 00:04:11.260
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:04:11.260 --> 00:04:12.384
It's just nasty.

00:04:12.384 --> 00:04:13.800
DAVID LITT: Something
that's funny

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:16.010
just gets people
to pay attention.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:17.519
It gets people engaged.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:19.811
LAURA LING: President Obama
has amazing comedic timing.

00:04:19.811 --> 00:04:20.935
DAVID LITT: He really does.

00:04:20.935 --> 00:04:23.297
The president can hold a pause
for just the right amount

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.130
of time that there's a
little bit of tension

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:26.560
and then cut it
was a punch line.

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:28.810
PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Being
president is never easy.

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:32.500
I still have to fix a
broken immigration system,

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:36.580
issue veto threats,
negotiate with Iran,

00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:38.860
all while finding time
to pray five times a day.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:42.264
[AUDIENCE LAUGHS]

00:04:42.764 --> 00:04:43.740
Which is strenuous.

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.490
DAVID LITT: Then there's
also just moments

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:52.060
when you write
something, whether it's

00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:55.864
a joke or a more serious line
of argument that breaks through

00:04:55.864 --> 00:04:58.280
in some way and becomes part
of this national conversation

00:04:58.280 --> 00:04:59.530
around an issue.

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:02.670
And a lot of the time,
that's a team effort,

00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.101
but to be one part of that
team-- it's a special thing.

00:05:06.101 --> 00:05:07.600
LAURA LING: What
have you loved most

00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:10.840
about working with the
president, President Obama?

00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.980
DAVID LITT: Well, I think there
is-- there's just something

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.370
extraordinary about
working for somebody who

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:18.760
is such a good writer,
such a good speaker,

00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.170
and has the ability to
just walk into a room

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.230
and create memories that
everybody else is going

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:24.810
to remember for a lifetime.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:28.430
And so you get to be part of all
of these life-changing moments

00:05:28.430 --> 00:05:29.980
in little ways and big ways.

00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:33.670
And that is-- when I walk into
a room, that doesn't happen.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:37.210
So that was nice to get to
play a small part in that.

00:05:41.256 --> 00:05:43.130
LAURA LING: How do
Hillary Clinton and Donald

00:05:43.130 --> 00:05:46.190
Trump differ when it comes
to giving political speeches?

00:05:46.190 --> 00:05:49.350
Be sure to watch this episode
of Seeker Daily to learn more.

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:52.120
Clinton is trying to reach
out to younger voters who

00:05:52.120 --> 00:05:54.650
may not be familiar
with the Clinton legacy.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.560
And this may take a
little extra effort

00:05:56.560 --> 00:05:58.310
than it would take
Trump, who already

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.640
has an established
television presence.

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:03.300
DAVID LITT: I think for somebody
who is by her own admission

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:07.680
not a natural performer, she is
trying to get better and better

00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:09.542
and focus attention
where it needs to be.

00:06:09.542 --> 00:06:11.500
