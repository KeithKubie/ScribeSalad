I HAVEN'T FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU,
[ BLEEP ].

00:00:19.752 --> 00:00:22.088 align:start position:0% line:91%

I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN ABOUT YOU.

00:00:22.121 --> 00:00:25.758 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT YOU THE

00:00:25.791 --> 00:00:26.759 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHOLE TIME!

00:00:26.792 --> 00:00:29.162 align:start position:0% line:91%

00:00:36.669 --> 00:00:38.037 align:start position:0% line:91%
LEAST 48 WOMEN WHO HAVE ACCUSED
COSBY.

00:00:38.070 --> 00:00:41.441 align:start position:0% line:91%
(IMITATING COSBY)
AND IT IS FULL OF THINGS ABOUT

00:00:41.474 --> 00:00:45.812 line:91%
THE INAPPROPRIATE, THE BLAH,
BLAH, THE BIZZAH BAZZAHS, THE

00:00:45.845 --> 00:00:48.714 align:start position:0% line:91%
RAPING AND THE TOUCHING AND THE

00:00:48.747 --> 00:00:52.618 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE THE

00:00:52.651 --> 00:00:56.189 line:85%
QUAALUDES, THE LAWYER ASKED HIM.

00:00:56.222 --> 00:00:59.959 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE SAYS I USED THEM.

00:00:59.992 --> 00:01:01.060 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE SAID, FOR WHAT?

00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.162 size:84% position:42% line:91%
COSBY SAID, THE SAME AS YOU
WOULD, SAY, HAVE A DRINK.

00:01:03.195 --> 00:01:05.098 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: NO, NO NO!

00:01:05.131 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start position:0% line:85%
IT'S NOT THE SAME.

00:01:07.533 --> 00:01:11.437 line:91%
"LET'S HAVE A DRINK" ISN'T A FUN
WAY TO TELL SOMEONE YOU'RE GOING

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:12.071 align:start position:0% line:85%
TO RUFI THEM.

00:01:12.104 --> 00:01:15.174 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
JUST LIKE "LET'S

00:01:15.207 --> 00:01:17.610 align:start position:0% line:91%
HANG OUT" ISN'T A CUTESY WAY OF
SAYING YOU'RE ORGANIZING A

00:01:17.643 --> 00:01:18.911 align:start position:0% line:85%
LYNCHING.

00:01:18.944 --> 00:01:20.480 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
NOT THE SAME.

00:01:20.513 --> 00:01:23.349 align:start position:0% line:91%
(IMITATING COSBY)
OKAY, SO WHAT WAS ANOTHER "COSBY

00:01:23.382 --> 00:01:25.284 align:start position:0% line:91%

THING?

00:01:25.317 --> 00:01:27.420 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; SHE MEETS ME BACKSTAGE.

00:01:27.453 --> 00:01:29.255 align:start position:0% line:85%
I GIVE HER QUAALUDES.

00:01:29.288 --> 00:01:30.890 align:start position:0% line:85%
WE THEN HAD SEX.

00:01:30.923 --> 00:01:33.359 size:88% position:44% line:91%
THE LAWYER SAYS SHE SAID SHE
BELIEVES SHE WAS NOT IN THE

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.394 align:start position:0% line:91%
POSITION TO CONSENT TO
INTERCOURSE AFTER YOU GAVE HER

00:01:35.427 --> 00:01:36.829 align:start position:0% line:85%
THE DRUG.

00:01:36.862 --> 00:01:38.464 line:85%
DO YOU BELIEVE THAT IS CORRECT?

00:01:38.497 --> 00:01:40.833 size:88% position:44% line:85%
I DON'T KNOW, COSBY REPLIED.

00:01:40.866 --> 00:01:41.734 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: YES, YOU DO!

00:01:41.767 --> 00:01:44.770 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
YOU GAVE HER A DRUG AND THEN HAD

00:01:44.803 --> 00:01:46.372 align:start position:0% line:85%
SEX WITH HER!

00:01:46.405 --> 00:01:49.008 line:85%
YOU KNEW SHE COULDN'T CONSENT!

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:52.178 line:91%
LOOK, I ONLY KNOW THREE THINGS
IN LIFE TO BE TRUE: BABY CORN

00:01:52.211 --> 00:01:52.945 align:start position:0% line:85%
SHOULD NOT BE A THING.

00:01:52.978 --> 00:01:56.382 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT?

00:01:56.415 --> 00:01:59.886 align:start position:0% line:91%
THE WORD "MOIST" SHOULD NEVER BE
USED EXCEPT NEXT TO THE WORD

00:01:59.919 --> 00:02:00.420 align:start position:0% line:85%
TOWELETTE.

00:02:00.453 --> 00:02:02.255 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
ALL RIGHT?

00:02:02.288 --> 00:02:05.791 align:start position:0% line:85%
TRUE?

00:02:05.824 --> 00:02:07.527 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND BILL COSBY KNEW WHAT HE WAS
DOING.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:11.364 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
HE KNEW IT.

00:02:11.397 --> 00:02:13.166 line:85%
YOU CAN'T DO THAT AND NOT KNOW.

00:02:13.199 --> 00:02:14.534 align:start position:0% line:91%
(APPLAUSE)
ALL RIGHT?

00:02:14.567 --> 00:02:16.836 align:start position:0% line:91%
(IMITATING COSBY)
OKAY, LET'S KEEP THIS GOING!

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:19.605 align:start position:0% line:91%
WHAT ELSE CRAZIEST THING IT I

00:02:19.638 --> 00:02:22.141 align:start position:0% line:91%

ASKING ABOUT HER FATHER WHO DIED
OF CANCER.

00:02:26.078 --> 00:02:27.013 align:start position:0% line:85%
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:28.581 line:85%
YES, HE SAID, I REMEMBER THAT.

00:02:28.614 --> 00:02:29.282 size:75% position:38% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: OH, [ BLEEP ]!

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:30.683 align:start position:0% line:85%
NO, NO, NO.

(LAUGHTER)
PLEASE DON'T TELL ME YOU'RE

00:02:33.552 --> 00:02:37.990 line:91%
GOING TO USE THIS CANCER THING
AS A WAY TO GET HER INTO BED.

00:02:38.023 --> 00:02:39.692 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; DID YOU ASK HER THOSE
QUESTIONS BECAUSE YOU WANTED TO

00:02:39.725 --> 00:02:41.093 align:start position:0% line:85%
HAVE SEX WITH HER?

00:02:41.126 --> 00:02:43.729 size:88% position:44% line:85%
YES, I DID, BILL COSBY SAID.

[ AUDIENCE OHs ]
&gt;&gt; Larry: YOU USED HER DEAD

00:02:48.334 --> 00:02:51.671 align:start position:0% line:91%
FATHER TO HAVE SEX WITH HER --
LITERALLY HER GHOST DAD!

00:02:51.704 --> 00:02:55.208 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
I MEAN --

00:02:55.241 --> 00:02:59.712 align:start position:0% line:91%
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)
OKAY.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:02.548 align:start position:0% line:85%
WHAT ELSE?

00:03:02.581 --> 00:03:05.718 line:91%
&gt;&gt; HE ALSO ADMITS IN THIS THAT
HE NEVER WENT THE ENTIRE WAY

00:03:05.751 --> 00:03:08.254 align:start position:0% line:85%
WITH WOMEN.

00:03:08.287 --> 00:03:10.223 align:start position:0% line:91%
THAT HE BELIEVES SEXUAL
INTERCOURSE WAS CONCERNING

00:03:10.256 --> 00:03:11.824 align:start position:0% line:91%
BECAUSE SOMEBODY COULD FALL IN
LOVE WITH HIM.

00:03:11.857 --> 00:03:12.691 align:start position:0% line:85%
HE DIDN'T WANT THAT.

00:03:12.725 --> 00:03:17.363 align:start position:0% line:91%
(LAUGHTER)
&gt;&gt; Larry: SO LET ME BREAK THIS

00:03:17.396 --> 00:03:19.599 align:start position:0% line:85%

00:03:44.623 --> 00:03:46.125 align:start position:0% line:91%
SO WHAT ELSE DID THE COZ BRAG
ABOUT?

00:03:46.158 --> 00:03:49.729 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; COSBY CLAIMED HE AND HIS
ACCUSER WERE "PLAYING SEX, WERE

00:03:50.629 --> 00:03:51.464 align:start position:0% line:85%
&gt;&gt; Larry: PETTING?!

(LAUGHTER)
THAT'S GROSS.

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:56.736 align:start position:0% line:91%
I MEAN,
THIS ISN'T A FIELD OF CUTE

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.603 align:start position:0% line:85%
LITTLE PUPPIES, BILL.

00:04:05.577 --> 00:04:06.678 align:start position:0% line:85%
YOU DESERVE A BREAK.

00:04:06.712 --> 00:04:07.813 align:start position:0% line:91%

BACK TO THE BILE.

00:04:25.364 --> 00:04:27.133 align:start position:0% line:91%
IF THIS DEPOSITION PROVED
ANYTHING, IT'S THAT COSBY HAS

00:04:27.166 --> 00:04:28.901 line:85%
ABSOLUTELY NO SELF-AWARENESS.

00:04:28.934 --> 00:04:31.570 align:start position:0% line:91%
&gt;&gt; I THINK I'M A PRETTY DECENT

HOLD ON!

00:04:46.185 --> 00:04:49.088 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND WHAT DO YOU MEAN YOU ARE A
DECENT READER OF EMOTIONS?

00:04:49.121 --> 00:04:50.723 align:start position:0% line:91%
FIRST OF ALL, THERE IS NOTHING

ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

00:04:51.623 --> 00:04:52.524 align:start position:0% line:85%
ALL RIGHT?

00:04:52.558 --> 00:04:54.727 align:start position:0% line:91%
AND SECONDLY,
KNOCKED-OUT-AND-SNORING IS NOT

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:55.895 align:start position:0% line:85%
AN EMOTION.
