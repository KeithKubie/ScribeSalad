[ Laughter ]

00:00:12.130 --> 00:00:13.830
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I've
been asked to remind you

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.670
to please turn off
your cellphones.

00:00:16.670 --> 00:00:20.730
Also, to announce that Louise
Penny will be signing books

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:23.250
after our conversation.

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:27.140
And we -- and she will be taking
questions from the audience.

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:28.840
So, we'll try to
squeeze everything in.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.140
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Sure.

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.440
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: My
name is Maureen Corrigan.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:34.340
I'm the book credit
for NPR's Fresh Air --

[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:38.010

[ Cheers and applause ]

00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:46.340
-- as well as a regular
mystery reviewer

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:48.320
for the Washington Post.

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:49.620
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.470
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I have
been attending and participating

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.650
in the National Book Festival
for the last 18 years.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:58.580
During that time, I've had
the pleasure and privilege

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:03.520
of interviewing so many
authors whose work I admire.

00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.010
But I have to tell you, Louise
Penny is in a class by herself.

00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:09.310
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:09.310 --> 00:01:11.110

00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:15.040
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.120
&gt;&gt; As soon as I heard that
Louise was going to be here

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:20.390
at the National Book
Festival, I emailed Maria Rana

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.450
who runs this whole
amazing event and I said,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:25.010
"You must let me
interview Louise Penny -- "

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:26.800
[ Laughter ]

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.220
"-- or else, right?"

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:32.430
[ Laughter ]

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:37.550
I think I share with many of you
really almost a sense of awe.

00:01:37.550 --> 00:01:41.070
I don't know how to
characterize your mysteries.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:46.190
I read them and -- well, when
I reviewed "Glass Houses" --

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.250
which is the mystery
we're talking about today

00:01:49.250 --> 00:01:51.340
which has just come
out in paperback --

00:01:51.340 --> 00:01:53.550
when I reviewed it a
year ago when it came

00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:55.980
out in hardcover, I said this.

00:01:55.980 --> 00:02:00.010
I'm going to quote myself
in The Washington Post.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:01.310
[ Laughter ]

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:02.610
This was my first two sentences.

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:03.910
"Every August for
the past few years,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:07.280
I've read the latest Armand
Gamache detective novel

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.940
by Louise Penny and every August

00:02:09.940 --> 00:02:12.990
for the past few
years I've been ruined

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.010
for reading all other books -- "

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:20.010
"-- until the spell of
Gamache dissipates a bit."

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.310
[ Laughter ]

00:02:21.310 --> 00:02:24.790
And I know that many of
you feel that way too.

00:02:24.790 --> 00:02:26.090
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:27.390
[ Applause ]

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.690
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:30.850
Louise Penny's mysteries
are like no others.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.800
They're fiercely moral.

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:34.100
They're witty.

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:35.400
They're a bit profane.

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.700
They --

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.000
[ Laughter ]

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.250
-- include moments of cruelty,
of poetry, of eccentricity

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.930
and ultimately I think they
celebrate the saving grace

00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:48.070
of community.

00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:52.250
This -- "Glass Houses" is what?

00:02:52.250 --> 00:02:53.650
Your 13th book?

00:02:53.650 --> 00:02:54.950
Do I have that right?

00:02:54.950 --> 00:02:56.250
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: It is.

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:57.550
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Good.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:02:58.850
I've got two books up here.

00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:02.570
A word about that in a second,
but it's your 13th book.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:08.050
Louise's books debut
reliably as the number one

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.850
on the bestseller list
as soon as they're out.

00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:13.680
Among your many, many,

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.240
many other awards
you've won the Agatha

00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:18.950
for Best Mystery
Novel five times,

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:22.160
the Anthony for Best
Mystery five times.

00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:23.460
I'll stop there.

00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:24.760

to welcome you.

I can't begin to tell
you what an honor it is.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.860
I was just saying
that I'm not sure

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:48.160
that the email had
even completely landed

00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.460
in my inbox before
I was saying yes.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:52.060
&gt;&gt; I don't even know
that I was invited.

00:03:52.060 --> 00:03:53.360
But I said yes --

00:03:53.360 --> 00:03:54.660
[ Laughter ]

00:03:54.660 --> 00:03:55.960
-- and here I am.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.260
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Well, I want to start

00:03:57.260 --> 00:03:58.560
at the beginning --
beginning of the 13 plus one.

00:03:58.560 --> 00:03:59.860
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Right.

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:01.160
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I know
that you came to mysteries --

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.650
to writing books
-- a bit belatedly.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:04.950
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Right.

00:04:04.950 --> 00:04:06.340
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
You were in your forties

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:07.950
at the time you began writing.

00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.250
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
Which now from the age

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:10.550
of 60 looks not that late.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:12.400
[ Laughter ]

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:14.010
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I hear you.

00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:15.800
[ Laughter ]

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.410
Why the mystery form?

00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:18.710
Why was that the form you chose?

00:04:18.710 --> 00:04:20.010
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: That's a
really interesting question.

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:25.260
I started out -- I was going
to write the best book ever.

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:29.010
It was going to be a work
of transcendent genius.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.310
[ Laughter ]

00:04:30.310 --> 00:04:32.990
It was going to be historical,
fiction-based on something

00:04:32.990 --> 00:04:34.670
that actually happened.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.760
And it was as I said,
going to be genius,

00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.790
so that my mother
would be amazed,

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:43.640
and my former colleagues
would be jealous --

00:04:45.010 --> 00:04:46.310
[ Laughter ]

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:47.610
-- so that the professors

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:48.910
that thought I was a
dunderhead would have

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:50.210
to rethink the whole thing.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:51.510
[ Laughter ]

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:56.420
And I just got myself just
so stressed about having

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:59.810
to write the perfect book
that I ended up suffering

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:03.160
from writer's block for five
years -- five years, you know.

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.010
Three would've been enough --

00:05:05.010 --> 00:05:06.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:06.310 --> 00:05:08.650
-- but five!

00:05:08.650 --> 00:05:12.250
Got to the stage, Maureen
where Michael -- my husband --

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:15.010
was afraid to ask me
how the book was going.

00:05:15.010 --> 00:05:16.310
[ Laughter ]

00:05:16.310 --> 00:05:17.610
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yes.

00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:18.910
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: It was like
when I turned 35 and I hadn't --

00:05:18.910 --> 00:05:20.210
I was single and my
mother stopped asking me --

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:21.510
[ Laughter ]

00:05:21.510 --> 00:05:28.890
-- you know, "Have you
met any nice men lately?"

00:05:28.890 --> 00:05:30.190
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.490
[ Laughter ]

00:05:31.490 --> 00:05:32.790
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: "Have you
met any women you like?"

00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:34.090
[ Laughter ]

00:05:34.090 --> 00:05:35.390
Any farm animals you're
finding attractive?

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:36.690
[ Laughter ]

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.990
She stopped asking every day
and Michael got to that stage

00:05:37.990 --> 00:05:39.290
where he stopped asking,
"How's the book going, dear?"

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.590
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yes.

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:41.890
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: So, then I -- a
couple of things had to happen.

00:05:41.890 --> 00:05:47.600
As a journalist, I discovered
that in covering stories --

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.200
often tragedies, of course --
that while they might appear

00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.730
to happen out of the
blue in fact, they don't.

00:05:53.730 --> 00:05:56.710
It is a cascade of smaller
events often overlooked

00:05:56.710 --> 00:06:00.290
that culminate in the
one catastrophic event.

00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:03.390
But if you remove any
single small event --

00:06:03.390 --> 00:06:04.710
if you turn left
instead of right,

00:06:04.710 --> 00:06:08.470
if you put on pink instead of
red, any often-trivial thing --

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:11.120
the major thing wouldn't
have happened and the same

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.420
with great things in my life.

00:06:12.420 --> 00:06:17.310
And I look back on how did I
get to be sitting here today.

00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:20.540
And still, life came
because of a series

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.630
of really quite apparently
small things.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.980
But one of them was I
had one of the "aha!"

00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:30.180
moments sitting on the
sort of side of my bed.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:34.010
Michael used to call
me a horizontalist --

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.310
[ Laughter ]

00:06:35.310 --> 00:06:36.610
-- because I would spend
most of my life trying

00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:37.910
to get horizontal somewhere --

00:06:37.910 --> 00:06:39.210
[ Laughter ]

00:06:39.210 --> 00:06:41.460
-- the sofa, in a bathtub,
and my favorite place is lying

00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:44.020
on the bed reading
-- and still is.

00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.320
And I was preparing to do

00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.920
that when I looked
on the bedside table.

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.540
And there piled high
with all sorts of books,

00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.900
but very well represented
was crime fiction.

00:06:54.900 --> 00:06:59.060
And I had one of those moments
of just complete clarity.

00:06:59.060 --> 00:07:05.200
I thought, "I need to finally
write a book just for myself --

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.820
a book I would read, a book
that is written with joy,

00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.340
with gratitude, just for me."

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.640
And it would be crime fiction

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.680
because I love reading
crime fiction.

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.480
And so, that's where
that came from.

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:21.980
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I
think it's interesting.

00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:25.370
In your list of people who
you say, you wanted to impress

00:07:25.370 --> 00:07:27.100
with the first novel --

00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:29.190
those professors who didn't
think you were good enough.

00:07:29.190 --> 00:07:30.490
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: No.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:31.790
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:07:31.790 --> 00:07:33.090
And the Academy does
still turn its nose

00:07:33.090 --> 00:07:34.390
down a bit at crime fiction.

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:35.690
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Oh.

00:07:35.690 --> 00:07:36.990
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
I can tell you

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:38.290
because I teach a
course at Georgetown --

00:07:38.290 --> 00:07:39.590
[ Laughter ]

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:41.230
-- on detective fiction.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:43.830
And every once in a while,
my colleagues will say, "Oh,

00:07:43.830 --> 00:07:45.130
that must be fun", you know.

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:46.430
[ Laughter ]

00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:47.730
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Right, yeah.

00:07:47.730 --> 00:07:49.030
"One day you'll be good
enough to teach real -- "

00:07:49.030 --> 00:07:50.330
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:51.630
Yeah. Yeah.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:52.930

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:54.230
[ Laughter ]

00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:55.530
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But --

00:07:55.530 --> 00:07:56.830
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yeah.

00:07:56.830 --> 00:07:58.130
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But --

00:07:58.130 --> 00:07:59.430
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yeah.

00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:00.730
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But no,
honestly it drives me crazy.

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:02.030
But you, like Raymond
Chandler started late.

00:08:02.030 --> 00:08:03.330
Raymond Chandler was
in his fifties --

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.630
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Was he?

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:05.930
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: -- when
he published "The Big Sleep".

00:08:05.930 --> 00:08:07.230
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I
didn't know that.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:08.530
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
And I think of you

00:08:08.530 --> 00:08:09.830
and Raymond Chandler
together because of that

00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:11.130
and because also, Chandler said
he wanted to do something more

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:12.430
with the mystery form.

00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:13.730
I think of you as
doing something more

00:08:13.730 --> 00:08:15.310
with the mystery form.

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:16.610
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:17.910
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And I --

00:08:17.910 --> 00:08:20.700
one of the things I think
you do, is you make mysteries

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:23.760
into spiritual investigations.

00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:26.720
You're thinking about
the problem of evil

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.590
and why it exists in the world,
why it exists in people's souls.

00:08:32.590 --> 00:08:34.150
Am I reading too much into you?

00:08:34.150 --> 00:08:35.450
I mean, I don't --

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:36.750
[ Laughter ]

00:08:36.750 --> 00:08:38.050
I don't think I am, but.

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:39.350
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
No, that's -- and --

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:42.130
but it's a very difficult
issue for me to talk about

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:43.830
or question to answer.

00:08:43.830 --> 00:08:45.250
And I -- thank you for saying

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.750
that I'm doing something
new with the genre.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:49.050
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:51.280
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I -- and I'm
very proud to be a crime writer.

00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:56.800
But I also -- when I
started writing "Still Life",

00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.120
I didn't know that
there were rules at all.

00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:04.010
So, I just -- as I
said, I just wrote --

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:05.310
[ Coughing ]

00:09:05.310 --> 00:09:06.610
-- you know, without intending
to break any of the rules.

00:09:06.610 --> 00:09:08.640
And one of the things I kind
of like about "Still Life" --

00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.790
and in fact, I think I like
about the whole series --

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:15.940
is that they adhere
to the rules while

00:09:15.940 --> 00:09:19.570
at the same time I'm helping
sort of transcend the rules.

00:09:19.570 --> 00:09:24.440
But they are like
neocrime fiction -- new --

00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:25.740
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:09:25.740 --> 00:09:27.040
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: --
moving it forward.

00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.830
Making it both crime
fiction in the classic sense,

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:34.080
but also blurring the
lines with other --

00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.160
with literary fiction,
and poetry, and --

00:09:36.160 --> 00:09:37.460
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:09:37.460 --> 00:09:38.760
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
-- other things.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:40.060
[ Coughing ]

00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:41.360
So, that's sort of
how I came to it.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:42.660
Now I've forgotten
what the question was.

00:09:42.660 --> 00:09:43.960
[ Laughter ]

00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:45.260
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Well, I was posing --

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:46.560
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
It's a spirituality.

00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:47.860
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: --

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.160
this big, academic
reading of your books.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:50.460
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: No,
just spiritually, yes.

00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:51.760
That's --

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:53.060
[ Laughter ]

00:09:53.060 --> 00:09:54.360
-- so true.

00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:55.660
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:56.960
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:09:56.960 --> 00:09:58.260
[ Laughter ]

00:09:58.260 --> 00:09:59.560
[ Coughing ]

00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:00.860
There's --

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:03.830
I read a lot of poetry as you
can probably tell from the books

00:10:03.830 --> 00:10:06.810
and I use quite a
lot of poetry in it.

00:10:06.810 --> 00:10:11.630
But one of my favorites
is Oden and Oden's eulogy

00:10:11.630 --> 00:10:14.100
to Yates clearly
after Yates died.

00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:20.550
And one of the first lines
is, "Mad Ireland hurt him

00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:24.730
in the poetry" which is just
a brilliant line and it's --

00:10:24.730 --> 00:10:27.110
in that line, you understand
everything you need to know

00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.960
about Ireland, about
poetry, and about Yates.

00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.260
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:10:31.260 --> 00:10:33.100
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And I think
I connected with that line

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:36.010
because I had to be hurt
into writing as well.

00:10:36.010 --> 00:10:40.220
And I think out of that pain,
I tried to write all my life.

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.720
But I was raised with a lot of
-- quite a bit of affluence.

00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:48.370
I was very, very
fortunate in my upbringing.

00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:51.290
I was never particularly hurt

00:10:51.290 --> 00:10:55.010
and I was fairly
self-absorbed and callous.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.310
[ Coughing ]

00:10:56.310 --> 00:10:58.350
And so, a lot of what I
was writing was out of ego.

00:10:58.350 --> 00:11:00.420
I wanted to have accolades.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.230
I wanted to sit in front
of a room like this.

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:05.410
This would've absolutely
blown my 12-year-old mind.

00:11:05.410 --> 00:11:07.800
[ Laughter ]

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:14.080
But it was right in from that
ego place and I really had

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:15.590
to be hurt into writing.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.580
I had to be really humbled.

00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:21.360
I had to know a lot of grief,

00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.360
and a lot of sorrow,
and a lot of loss.

00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:25.260
I had to come --

00:11:25.260 --> 00:11:28.750
I'm a recovering alcoholic
and I had to bottom.

00:11:28.750 --> 00:11:33.890
And I had to come to
and through despair.

00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:36.040
I had to know what it felt
like to stand in the middle

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.460
of my living room
and want to die.

00:11:38.460 --> 00:11:40.020
And the only reason
I didn't die --

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:42.970
and I'm a huge advocate
of gun control which isn't

00:11:42.970 --> 00:11:45.410
that difficult being
a Canadian frankly.

00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.800
[ Laughter ]

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.670
It's hard to find
a gun in Canada.

00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.180
Because I know had there
been a gun in the house,

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.900
I wouldn't be here today.

00:11:55.900 --> 00:11:59.370
So, that sort of thing you
reach a fork in the road

00:11:59.370 --> 00:12:04.060
where you either die,
or become embittered,

00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:06.910
or you find something
bigger than yourself.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:08.330
And I think that's
what the books are

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:11.490
about -- that you find hope.

00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:16.570
You understand what it
is to find a community,

00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.840
and a sense of belonging,
and a sense of purpose.

00:12:18.840 --> 00:12:20.890
And that's what the
books are about and I --

00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:24.380
from my point of view, they
are spiritual journeys.

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:29.090
But I'm hoping for those
people who don't want a God,

00:12:29.090 --> 00:12:32.220
or need a God, or have a God
-- which is just fine with me.

00:12:32.220 --> 00:12:34.020
I have no need to
prosthetize [assumed spelling]

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:39.010
that they are also
humanist journeys as well.

00:12:39.010 --> 00:12:40.310
[ Coughing ]

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:41.630
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Let me just
say that the way you just spoke

00:12:41.630 --> 00:12:46.290
about your books is the reason
why so many of us love them --

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:49.110
the genuineness,
the openness that --

00:12:49.110 --> 00:12:53.360
the way you share the
pain as well as so much

00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.320
about being human that
comes through in the books.

00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.690
And I was always
struck by that letter.

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:00.360
I forget which mystery it was

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.290
that you wrote a letter
prefacing the mystery talking

00:13:03.290 --> 00:13:05.620
about your books
as your children.

00:13:05.620 --> 00:13:08.940
And I think so many of us
feel how much they matter

00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:10.460
to you and to us.

00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:11.760
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: They do.

00:13:11.760 --> 00:13:13.060
I have no children.

00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:15.690
And so, this is -- if I
have a legacy, it's this.

00:13:15.690 --> 00:13:16.990
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:13:16.990 --> 00:13:18.290
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And
so, I poor everything.

00:13:18.290 --> 00:13:19.590
I create one thing in a year.

00:13:19.590 --> 00:13:20.890
One thing.

00:13:20.890 --> 00:13:22.190
One thing.

00:13:22.190 --> 00:13:23.490
[ Laughter ]

00:13:23.490 --> 00:13:26.120
It better be worth my time.

00:13:26.120 --> 00:13:28.450
And it sure as hell
better be worth your time,

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:31.530
and your money, and your effort.

00:13:31.530 --> 00:13:34.630
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Well,
the person in the novels

00:13:34.630 --> 00:13:38.890
who leads us through these
journeys is Armand Gamache

00:13:38.890 --> 00:13:43.160
and I know -- when I read
him, I -- well, first of all,

00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:45.010
I think many of us in the room
are half in love with him.

00:13:45.010 --> 00:13:46.890
[ Laughter ]

00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:51.250
And I know that you modeled him
on your late husband, Michael.

00:13:51.250 --> 00:13:52.550
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:13:52.550 --> 00:13:53.850
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: You've
said that in many interviews.

00:13:53.850 --> 00:13:58.850
But I also always think he
must've been difficult to create

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:01.170
because he's not eccentric.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:04.710
I think it's so much easier to
create that kind of detective

00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:06.640
who has all of those oddities --

00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.940
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
The expectations.

00:14:07.940 --> 00:14:09.240
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah,
and doesn't, you know --

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:10.540
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yeah.

00:14:10.540 --> 00:14:11.840
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: --
interact with the world well.

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.490
He's in the center
of a community.

00:14:13.490 --> 00:14:14.790
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Right.

00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.090
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
And I'd like you

00:14:16.090 --> 00:14:17.390
to talk a little bit
about creating him.

00:14:17.390 --> 00:14:18.690
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Well, that
was -- every decision I made,

00:14:18.690 --> 00:14:21.490
Maureen was because I didn't
actually think that the book --

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.800
I wanted it to be published
and I wanted it to be a series.

00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.570
But I really -- I knew the
chances were very small

00:14:28.570 --> 00:14:30.280
that it actually
would be published --

00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:32.610
"Still Life" and grow to --

00:14:32.610 --> 00:14:33.910
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:14:33.910 --> 00:14:35.210
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
-- into a series.

00:14:35.210 --> 00:14:36.760
So, every decision I made
was selfish because I thought

00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:40.040
that was going to be the
only reward I would get.

00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:42.140
So, when it came to
creating Gamache,

00:14:42.140 --> 00:14:46.050
I had heard that
Agatha Christie --

00:14:46.050 --> 00:14:48.950
who I love and I still read --

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.360
but that she grew
weary of Poirot.

00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.010
I think one of the reasons
she grew weary of Poirot --

00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:56.310
[ Laughter ]

00:14:56.310 --> 00:14:57.610
-- was that he didn't change.

00:14:57.610 --> 00:14:59.140
He didn't evolve.

00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.950
He was essentially the
same person in 1919

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.730
when she started the first
book as he was when she died

00:15:05.730 --> 00:15:09.650
and when he died in the 1960's.

00:15:09.650 --> 00:15:13.820
So, I really wanted someone
who would grow and evolve.

00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:17.810
But mostly, I just
wanted someone

00:15:17.810 --> 00:15:20.220
who I wouldn't grow tired of.

00:15:20.220 --> 00:15:21.750
And I thought, "Now
how do I do that?

00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:23.590
How do I mitigate against that?"

00:15:23.590 --> 00:15:26.520
And I thought, "Really,
the only way to do it is

00:15:26.520 --> 00:15:30.010
to create a character
I would marry."

00:15:30.010 --> 00:15:31.310
[ Laughter ]

00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:33.550
And so, that's what I did
and I sure didn't want

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:35.490
to marry an alcoholic.

00:15:35.490 --> 00:15:37.370
I didn't want to marry
someone who's embittered.

00:15:37.370 --> 00:15:39.520
I didn't want to
marry an adulterer.

00:15:39.520 --> 00:15:42.940
I wanted to marry someone whose
company I would always enjoy,

00:15:42.940 --> 00:15:44.550
and who I would find
fascinating,

00:15:44.550 --> 00:15:47.900
and a decent human being,
and a good human being.

00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:50.010
And also, as I said, who's --

00:15:50.010 --> 00:15:51.310
[ Sneezing ]

00:15:51.310 --> 00:15:54.140
-- because probably the only
enjoyment I would get would be

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.440
the writing of the books.

00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.740
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.730
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: So,
every day I go down.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:01.320
I -- and I'm in this company.

00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:04.600
And I loved writing
"Still Life".

00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:09.230
And then, thank God, you know,
13 books later oddly enough --

00:16:09.230 --> 00:16:10.530
I don't know if you've
noticed it,

00:16:10.530 --> 00:16:14.010
but he does not seem
to be aging --

00:16:18.310 --> 00:16:19.610
It's a miracle.

00:16:19.610 --> 00:16:20.910
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: It's --

00:16:20.910 --> 00:16:22.210
[ Laughter ]

00:16:22.210 --> 00:16:23.510
It's great and you've just
reassured us that he's not going

00:16:23.510 --> 00:16:25.270
to be thrown over the
Reichenbach Falls or gotten --

00:16:26.570 --> 00:16:27.870
No. No. No.

00:16:27.870 --> 00:16:29.170

00:16:30.470 --> 00:16:31.770
No, I don't know.

00:16:31.770 --> 00:16:33.070
I don't know why -- why do --

00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:34.370
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:16:34.370 --> 00:16:35.670
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Why
do writers do that?

00:16:35.670 --> 00:16:36.970
I mean, I can see growing tired.

00:16:36.970 --> 00:16:38.270
I mean, I would -- I've
not grown tired yet of any

00:16:38.270 --> 00:16:41.040
of my characters, but I
could see maybe it happening.

00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.340
But why do you have
to make it --

00:16:42.340 --> 00:16:43.640
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:44.940

00:16:44.940 --> 00:16:46.240

write a sequel where --

[ Laughter ]

00:17:03.110 --> 00:17:05.020
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Let's talk
for a bit about "Glass Houses"

00:17:05.020 --> 00:17:07.230
which has just come
out in paperback.

00:17:07.230 --> 00:17:11.230
If you haven't read it, of
course you're in for a treat.

00:17:11.230 --> 00:17:18.500
The opening situation is that
it's Halloween in Three Pines

00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:22.860
and we have this mysterious
figure cloaked head to toe

00:17:22.860 --> 00:17:28.070
in black masked comes
into the village

00:17:28.070 --> 00:17:30.210
and everyone begins
talking about,

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:34.320
"Why is this very unsettling
figure that looks like something

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:39.150
out of Edgar Allan Poe -- why
is this figure standing there?"

00:17:39.150 --> 00:17:43.900
It turns out that the figure
is something called a Cobrador.

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:45.200
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:46.570

centuries old figure from Spain.

you talk a bit about that?

&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I --

00:17:50.470 --> 00:17:52.140
do you want me to talk about how
I found out about the Cobrador?

00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.440
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yes,

00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.740
because how on earth did
you stumble across it?

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.040

That's a good question.

Michael's best friend --

00:18:02.540 --> 00:18:03.840
Michael went to Cambridge

00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:08.730
and his best friend
there became the editor

of the Financial
Times in Madrid.

00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:15.450
And he came to visit us once and
we were sitting around chatting.

00:18:15.450 --> 00:18:16.750
And he said, "You know,

00:18:16.750 --> 00:18:18.050
you've probably never
heard of this thing.

00:18:18.050 --> 00:18:22.430
But every now and then I'm
walking through Barcelona

00:18:22.430 --> 00:18:25.350
and I'll run into this figure."

00:18:25.350 --> 00:18:28.010
He's not actually the way
I describe him, but --

00:18:28.010 --> 00:18:29.310
[ Laughter ]

00:18:29.310 --> 00:18:32.080
-- a Cobrador is
a debt collector.

00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:35.770
And what he is, he's all dressed
very formally with a top hat,

00:18:35.770 --> 00:18:39.120
and tails, and carrying
a briefcase.

00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.970
And he stands out in
front of someone's home.

00:18:41.970 --> 00:18:44.250
And when they come
out, he follows them

00:18:44.250 --> 00:18:45.550
at a respectful distance --

00:18:45.550 --> 00:18:47.640
never speaks, never
engages them.

00:18:47.640 --> 00:18:50.980
Follows them to work, stands
outside of the office building.

00:18:50.980 --> 00:18:53.860
When the guy goes for lunch,
follows him for lunch,

00:18:53.860 --> 00:18:59.080
stands outside the
restaurant just silent staring.

00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.120
And everybody knows
what a Cobrador is.

00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:02.420
It's a debt collector.

this person has not paid --

[ Coughing ]

00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:07.660

00:19:07.660 --> 00:19:08.960
[ Sigh ]

00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:10.260
And the idea is the
power of shame.

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:11.560
They are humiliating this
person into paying a debt.

00:19:11.560 --> 00:19:12.860
[ Coughing ]

00:19:12.860 --> 00:19:18.750
The Cobrador that shows up in
Three Pines, once they figure

00:19:18.750 --> 00:19:20.590
out who this figure
is who's standing

00:19:20.590 --> 00:19:26.810
on the village green just
staring is a much older version

00:19:26.810 --> 00:19:29.240
of the modern Cobrador.

00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.540
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:19:30.540 --> 00:19:34.170
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And this
version is a conscience

00:19:34.170 --> 00:19:35.470
and the debt that he's come

00:19:35.470 --> 00:19:39.910
to collect is a moral
debt, not a financial one.

00:19:39.910 --> 00:19:43.990
And it's -- what I found
fascinating is that every person

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:48.440
in Three Pines is suddenly
afraid that he's there for them

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:53.020
because we all have a moral
debt that has been unpaid.

00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:54.320

It's terrifying.

[ Laughter ]

00:19:55.620 --> 00:19:56.920

found it kind of terrifying too.

&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.520
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: There's
a scene in the book --

00:19:59.520 --> 00:20:00.820
and I know many of you
have probably read it.

00:20:00.820 --> 00:20:02.120
There's a scene in the book
where they're all sitting around

00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.990
and they confess what
that moral debt is --

00:20:04.990 --> 00:20:06.290
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:07.590
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: --
that they all have.

00:20:07.590 --> 00:20:09.540
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Yeah, it's terrifying.

00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:13.430
You're bringing back a
crime from the past that has

00:20:13.430 --> 00:20:16.440
to be solved which
so many mysteries do.

00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.480
It's part of the
form that, you know,

00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:21.720
something from the past
doesn't let go and comes back.

00:20:21.720 --> 00:20:23.020
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:20:23.020 --> 00:20:24.320
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: But I --

00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:25.880
what you also do so
beautifully is you open --

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:28.960
you seem to use your
mysteries as social criticism

00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:31.000
as well -- social commentary.

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:36.290
And there's usually a plot
that comments on society today.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:40.410
In this book, it's something
about the opioid crisis.

00:20:40.410 --> 00:20:41.710
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Right.

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:43.370
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: And I
think that that's, you know,

00:20:43.370 --> 00:20:45.450
that's a particular
strength of mysteries --

00:20:45.450 --> 00:20:47.560
yours and so many
other mysteries --

00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.170
that they can do that.

00:20:49.170 --> 00:20:52.920
They can act as our modern
form of social fiction.

00:20:52.920 --> 00:20:56.830
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I think the
mystery form in any form --

00:20:56.830 --> 00:20:58.470
even cozies -- is
just such an --

00:20:58.470 --> 00:21:02.150
it's such a malleable
and powerful form.

00:21:02.150 --> 00:21:05.300
What batter way to investigate
the human condition --

00:21:05.300 --> 00:21:06.600
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:08.670
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- than
when some crime has happened

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.970
or about to happen?

00:21:09.970 --> 00:21:12.780
And yes, in this case it's
the opioid epidemic --

00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.080
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:17.380
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- and
Gamache having to face,

00:21:17.380 --> 00:21:19.840
and spar with his
own conscience.

00:21:19.840 --> 00:21:24.060
And one of the themes of
my books is inspired often

00:21:24.060 --> 00:21:26.310
by a bit of poetry or a quote.

00:21:26.310 --> 00:21:28.880
And in this particular book,
the quote is from Gandhi.

00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.030
And I'm just trying to --

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:33.190
I probably won't get
it absolutely right,

00:21:33.190 --> 00:21:37.330
but Gandhi said that, "There is
a higher Court than the Court

00:21:37.330 --> 00:21:40.600
of Law and that's the
court of the conscience

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.420
which supersedes
all other courts."

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.720
Which sounds good --

00:21:45.720 --> 00:21:47.020
[ Coughing ]

00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:52.320
-- because Gandhi
said it after all

00:21:52.320 --> 00:22:00.010
and who's going to
fight with Gandhi?

00:22:00.010 --> 00:22:01.310
[ Laughter ]

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:05.040
Until you start thinking like,

00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:11.050
"In Gandhi's hands,
that's not too bad.

00:22:11.050 --> 00:22:15.200
But how many vile acts
have been committed

00:22:15.200 --> 00:22:17.790
in the name of the conscience?"

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.090
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:22:19.090 --> 00:22:20.390
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And in this
case, Gamache is struggling

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:22.410
with his own conscience
of having to do --

00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.630
when you're faced with such a
monster like the opioid epidemic

00:22:26.630 --> 00:22:27.930
and those who traffic in it.

00:22:27.930 --> 00:22:29.960
Do you have to do something
monstrous to fight it?

00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.220
And Gamache is struggling
with that.

00:22:32.220 --> 00:22:35.710
And among the things he thinks
about was Churchill having

00:22:35.710 --> 00:22:39.640
to turn a blind eye knowing the
Coventry was going to be bombed,

00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:42.700
and having to allow it to be
bombed, and all those deaths,

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:48.430
and all that destruction because
he knew that if he didn't,

00:22:48.430 --> 00:22:51.230
the Germans would know they'd
broken the code and he needed

00:22:51.230 --> 00:22:53.300
that to be kept secret.

00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.080
So, he sat there that night and
allowed Coventry to be bombed.

00:22:58.080 --> 00:23:01.570
And the others -- the
Conquistadors landing

00:23:01.570 --> 00:23:05.830
and burning the ships, so that
you can't go back and that --

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:07.130
that becomes elite
motif [assumed spelling]

00:23:07.130 --> 00:23:08.990
through the book of
burning your ships.

00:23:08.990 --> 00:23:10.460
Burning your ships
you can't go back.

00:23:10.460 --> 00:23:14.640
Do something for which
there is no return.

00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:19.950
And that's what Gamache who
was a good man and a moral man.

00:23:19.950 --> 00:23:23.090
And he -- people he
trusts and believes

00:23:23.090 --> 00:23:24.510
in him both are begging
him not to do it.

00:23:24.510 --> 00:23:27.070
And he just -- he's
struggling with himself.

00:23:27.070 --> 00:23:29.030
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: You're
talking about these larger

00:23:29.030 --> 00:23:30.330
than life incidents
and decisions.

00:23:30.330 --> 00:23:31.730
And I want to carry that
forward to ask you a question

00:23:31.730 --> 00:23:33.030
about the structure of this book

00:23:33.030 --> 00:23:34.330
and so many others
of your mysteries.

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:35.630
By my count, you've had at least
four apocalyptic endings --

00:23:35.630 --> 00:23:36.930

the most useless question.

no, a Maureen question.

00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:52.530
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: How do you?

00:23:52.530 --> 00:23:56.050
I can't imagine how you work
yourself up just technically

00:23:56.050 --> 00:24:01.380
as a writer to the plot
exploding the way it does

00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:02.680
at the end here.

00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:05.730
The tension is such
that as a reader,

00:24:05.730 --> 00:24:07.370
I'm not just saying this.

00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:08.670
I know that I'm not breathing.

00:24:08.670 --> 00:24:10.010
I'm not doing my yoga
breathing as I'm reading --

00:24:10.010 --> 00:24:11.310
[ Laughter ]

00:24:11.310 --> 00:24:13.150
-- as I'm reading it.

00:24:13.150 --> 00:24:17.480
Do you have a sense of
the ending when you start

00:24:17.480 --> 00:24:20.200
or does the story
lead you along?

00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:21.500
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I sometimes do.

00:24:21.500 --> 00:24:23.860
Sometimes it's something and I'm
being completely honest with you

00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:25.230
because it -- this is --

00:24:25.230 --> 00:24:29.600
it sounds so be known
[assumed spelling].

00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:31.350
Sometimes early on even before,

00:24:31.350 --> 00:24:33.840
I started writing
I'll see something.

00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:37.470
And in this case, I mean,
it's so embarrassing.

00:24:37.470 --> 00:24:39.100
I know you won't tell anyone.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.190
[ Laughter ]

00:24:41.190 --> 00:24:46.860
But I had a vision of
Gamache running through --

00:24:46.860 --> 00:24:49.000
I guess I was walking the dog
or something through the forest

00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:50.300
and running through
the forest --

00:24:50.300 --> 00:24:51.600
[ Coughing ]

00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.990
-- you know, between the
trees and in the sunshine.

00:24:53.990 --> 00:24:55.950
Just running like hell-bent.

00:24:55.950 --> 00:24:57.660
Hell-bent, you know.

00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:59.300
He's not a young man running.

00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.740
I thought, "Now what, you
know, what's that about?

00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.400
What would he -- what
would make him do that?

00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:08.740
What's he running toward and
who's he running after with

00:25:08.740 --> 00:25:12.100
such determination that
he would, you know,

00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:14.040
he's going to -- you
could see that he's going

00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.340
to catch up with whatever.

00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.760
It's going to kill
him to try to do it."

00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.860
So, that -- and that's one of
the things that spurs me on.

00:25:21.860 --> 00:25:24.420
So, I don't know the
exact ending necessarily

00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:25.720
or that it would be --

00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:27.020
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:25:27.020 --> 00:25:28.320
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: --
necessarily apocalyptic.

00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:29.620
I have to say that one
of the challenges --

00:25:29.620 --> 00:25:30.920
I mean, there were
many challenges

00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.220
in this book structurally.

00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:36.580
But one of the challenges when
there is an ending like that --

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.880
like there was in "How
the Light Gets In"

00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:42.050
for instance was another one --

00:25:42.050 --> 00:25:43.570
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:25:43.570 --> 00:25:46.170
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- is
to make it believable

00:25:46.170 --> 00:25:47.850
because it's so important to me.

00:25:47.850 --> 00:25:53.140
These aren't, you know,
Mission Impossible type things

00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:56.280
where they're always blowing
up things, and running around,

00:25:56.280 --> 00:25:59.140
and falling on the ground, and
having fistfights, and stuff.

00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.860
These are -- I hope --
characters that we can believe

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:05.040
in and that we identify with.

00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.830
And so, to have Gamache,
and [inaudible],

00:26:07.830 --> 00:26:10.780
and the others be doing
this even though the sort

00:26:10.780 --> 00:26:13.770
of payoff is it's not
completely unbelievable --

00:26:13.770 --> 00:26:15.070
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:26:15.070 --> 00:26:16.370
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
-- that they would.

00:26:16.370 --> 00:26:20.010
But you have to not be reading
it and go, "Oh, for God's sake!"

00:26:20.010 --> 00:26:21.310
[ Laughter ]

00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:23.780
You have to be with
them, and understand

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.480
where this is coming from,
and that they themselves --

00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.340
I mean, there's a scene
in this where Gamache is

00:26:28.340 --> 00:26:32.770
in the bistro -- without
going into too much detail.

00:26:32.770 --> 00:26:35.510
This is before the
alien invasion.

00:26:35.510 --> 00:26:41.530
[ Laughter ]

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:44.300
Gamache is just sitting
in the bistro with --

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:48.770
Ann Marie is there, and Ruth is
there, and so are the bad guys.

00:26:48.770 --> 00:26:50.330
They're at another table.

00:26:50.330 --> 00:26:53.110
And Gamache knows they're
there, but nobody else knows

00:26:53.110 --> 00:26:55.740
who they are and
what's about to happen.

00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.940
And so, that's -- those are the
quiet moments that for me are

00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:00.740
in many ways more apocalyptic

00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:02.260
than the running
through of the woods.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:04.280
This is that, "Oh my God!"

00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:05.580
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:06.880

"What's going to happen?"

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.730
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Yeah, it's wonderful.

00:27:08.730 --> 00:27:11.520
I've been told we just have
15 minutes left and I --

00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:12.820
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: No!

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:14.310
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yes,
and I want to leave time

00:27:14.310 --> 00:27:15.610
for audience questions.

00:27:15.610 --> 00:27:16.910
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.210
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: So,
I want to ask you this.

00:27:18.210 --> 00:27:22.600
I read your New York Times
interview a few weeks ago --

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.900
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:27:23.900 --> 00:27:25.200

"Buy the Book" interview --

00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.800
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
-- where you said --

00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.100
and I wanted to try to
quote you correctly, but --

00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:33.500
because you say it better than
I would if I just summarized it.

00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.130
You said that you realize
that all your books circle

00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:38.780
around the same thing --

00:27:38.780 --> 00:27:43.930
our yearning to belong,
our quest for home.

00:27:43.930 --> 00:27:49.710
Would you talk about that?

00:27:49.710 --> 00:27:55.510
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I've -- I
-- my friend, I guess not.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:28:02.290

It's a big one.

00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:05.010
It's --

00:28:05.010 --> 00:28:06.310
[ Laughter ]

00:28:06.310 --> 00:28:09.280
It's Homeric [assumed spelling].

00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:12.030
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I've
searched -- I've --

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.880
growing up I was very
lonely and I was never --

00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:16.790
I was always self-excluded.

00:28:16.790 --> 00:28:18.090
And so, the only idea

00:28:18.090 --> 00:28:20.930
of belonging was a
yearning that I always had.

00:28:20.930 --> 00:28:24.520
I always felt like I was
just outside the ring

00:28:24.520 --> 00:28:27.980
of the campfire, you know,
in the darkness, in the cold,

00:28:27.980 --> 00:28:30.630
and seeing everyone
there, and wanting to go

00:28:30.630 --> 00:28:33.770
and join the circle, but
afraid they wouldn't let me in.

00:28:33.770 --> 00:28:35.070
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:28:35.070 --> 00:28:36.800
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And
so, for me, that --

00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:38.950
and then, later in
life to find it --

00:28:38.950 --> 00:28:41.660
to find it in my little
village in the eastern townships

00:28:41.660 --> 00:28:44.250
where Michael and I moved,
to find love with Michael,

00:28:44.250 --> 00:28:46.840
to find belonging
in a 12-step group,

00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.550
to be given a second chance.

00:28:49.550 --> 00:28:54.340
And then, to find home, and
to know how precious that is,

00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.550
and how it changes your life,
and how it gives you courage

00:28:57.550 --> 00:28:59.380
to do things that you
may not normally do

00:28:59.380 --> 00:29:01.690
because you can always go
home, and lick your wounds,

00:29:01.690 --> 00:29:03.360
and people will put
their arms around you,

00:29:03.360 --> 00:29:04.660
and say, "You know what?

00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:05.960
It's okay.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.260
It's okay.

00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:08.560
And you'll be okay
and it'll get better."

00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.060
And mean it and not
run away from you.

00:29:10.060 --> 00:29:12.830
And so, that's what
"Three Pines" is about.

00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:14.580
"Three Pines" is
about belonging.

00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:17.390
It's about people who
accept you no matter what.

00:29:17.390 --> 00:29:18.970
I mean, they accept Ruth.

00:29:18.970 --> 00:29:20.270

00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:05.600
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Good for you!

00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.900
Yes.

00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:08.200
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: -- vision
of a house that's terrifying

00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:13.890
because it's been drained of
what makes a house a home.

00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.190
So, you'll love it.

00:30:15.190 --> 00:30:16.570
[ Laughter ]

00:30:16.570 --> 00:30:19.010
I'm not giving my copy away.

00:30:19.010 --> 00:30:20.310
[ Laughter ]

00:30:20.310 --> 00:30:21.610
Thank you, Louise Penny.

00:30:21.610 --> 00:30:22.910
It has been --

00:30:22.910 --> 00:30:24.210
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Oh, thank
you, Maureen Corrigan.

00:30:24.210 --> 00:30:25.510
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
-- such a pleasure.

00:30:25.510 --> 00:30:26.810
Yes.

00:30:26.810 --> 00:30:28.110
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Just the best,
most intelligent reviewer.

00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.410
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Thank you.

00:30:29.410 --> 00:30:30.710
[ Applause ]

00:30:30.710 --> 00:30:32.270
Thank you so much.

00:30:32.270 --> 00:30:33.570
Thank you.

00:30:33.570 --> 00:30:35.520
[ Applause ]

00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:36.820
Thank you.

00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.260
And we've got time for some
questions -- 10 minutes.

00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.560
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Good.

00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:40.860
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
So, if you would come

00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.160
up to the microphones.

00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:43.460
[ Laughter ]

00:30:43.460 --> 00:30:45.670
Oh, and can I just suggest
too because I know that all

00:30:45.670 --> 00:30:48.350
of the books are so interrelated
now and I know that some

00:30:48.350 --> 00:30:50.200
of you haven't read
all of the books.

00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:51.500
And we're going to
lock the doors

00:30:51.500 --> 00:30:55.010
and not let you out
till you have.

00:30:55.010 --> 00:30:56.310
[ Laughter ]

00:30:56.310 --> 00:30:58.860
But if you could try not
to have any spoilers,

00:30:58.860 --> 00:31:00.160
that would be good.

00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:02.450
And I don't simply
mean who murdered whom,

00:31:02.450 --> 00:31:05.600
but character development
as well is --

00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.510
so, I think if you just praise
me that would probably --

00:31:10.510 --> 00:31:15.100
[ Laughter ]

00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.060
I think that would
be the safest.

00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:19.110
[ Laughter ]

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:22.190
&gt;&gt; Audience: Well, I'll start
by saying I love all your books.

00:31:22.190 --> 00:31:23.490
They're fabulous.

00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:28.180
As somebody who was born
and raised in Montreal,

00:31:28.180 --> 00:31:31.520
but have lived -- I've lived
here for a number of years too.

00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:33.150
I was just wondering.

00:31:33.150 --> 00:31:37.910
This is probably an easy
question -- no spoilers.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:44.010
Is there any town in Eastern
Townships like Three Pines?

00:31:44.010 --> 00:31:45.310
[ Laughter ]

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:46.610
Are other places
I've come across --

00:31:46.610 --> 00:31:48.350
for example -- are they real?

00:31:48.350 --> 00:31:53.090
For example, the Gilbertine
[assumed spelling] Monastery

00:31:53.090 --> 00:31:57.250
in [inaudible] Something
-- is that real?

00:31:57.250 --> 00:31:58.550
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
Oh, [inaudible].

00:31:58.550 --> 00:31:59.850
&gt;&gt; Audience: [Inaudible]?

00:31:59.850 --> 00:32:01.150
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:32:01.150 --> 00:32:02.450
&gt;&gt; Audience: I couldn't
remember.

00:32:02.450 --> 00:32:05.800
Are these real places?

00:32:05.800 --> 00:32:09.010
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: No.

00:32:09.010 --> 00:32:10.310
[ Laughter ]

00:32:10.310 --> 00:32:11.610
But, you know, one regret --

00:32:11.610 --> 00:32:13.780
one thing I think I did wrong
was I'm glad I created Three

00:32:13.780 --> 00:32:16.470
Pines as an almost
mythical place.

00:32:16.470 --> 00:32:21.360
It certainly doesn't
exist except I talk

00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:23.610
about this a little bit at
the end of one of the books --

00:32:23.610 --> 00:32:24.910
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

00:32:24.910 --> 00:32:26.210
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- that Three
Pines -- and I genuine --

00:32:26.210 --> 00:32:27.510
I mean this sincerely.

00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:31.030
I think of Three Pines
as a state of mind --

00:32:31.030 --> 00:32:33.870
that when I choose
to be kind instead

00:32:33.870 --> 00:32:38.080
of making the cutting remark,
when I search out goodness

00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:44.540
and when I'm decent, then
I live in Three Pines

00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:46.010
which means I can -- I carry it

00:32:46.010 --> 00:32:48.450
with me wherever I
go and so do you.

00:32:48.450 --> 00:32:50.430
And I know when I'm
beyond the pale --

00:32:50.430 --> 00:32:52.660
when I've done something
unpleasant.

00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:56.660
But there are -- what I hope
I've captured is the sense

00:32:56.660 --> 00:33:00.220
of these villages that
I live in and around.

00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.820
Like Nolton, Quebec is
where I actually live

00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.480
and it's quite like Three Pines.

00:33:04.480 --> 00:33:09.840
Much bigger, but it is like
-- but like Three Pines, so.

00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:11.140
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank you.

00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:13.230
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:33:13.230 --> 00:33:14.970
&gt;&gt; Audience: Louise,
thank you so much

00:33:14.970 --> 00:33:17.460
for creating a place
I just want to revisit

00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:18.950
over and over again --

00:33:18.950 --> 00:33:20.250
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:33:20.250 --> 00:33:21.550
&gt;&gt; Audience: -- and
the inspiration

00:33:21.550 --> 00:33:25.270
that I feel particularly
from Gamache.

00:33:25.270 --> 00:33:27.430
And my question is I've noticed

00:33:27.430 --> 00:33:31.680
in I think almost all the
books I've read so far,

00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:36.690
Gamache repeats something that
he says his mentor taught him --

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:42.970
four things that you need
if you want to be wise.

00:33:42.970 --> 00:33:45.430
The four things are,
"I'm sorry."

00:33:45.430 --> 00:33:47.250
"I was wrong."

00:33:47.250 --> 00:33:49.080
"I don't know."

00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:50.610
"I need help."

00:33:50.610 --> 00:33:51.910
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yes.

00:33:51.910 --> 00:33:53.210
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank
you so much for that

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:54.510
and where did it come from?

00:33:54.510 --> 00:33:55.810
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Where
did it come from?

00:33:55.810 --> 00:33:57.110
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah?

00:33:57.110 --> 00:33:58.410
[ Laughter ]

00:33:58.410 --> 00:33:59.710
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And than
you for remembering all four.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:01.010
I always -- almost always
remember three and then I --

00:34:01.010 --> 00:34:02.310
[ Laughter ]

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:03.610
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

00:34:03.610 --> 00:34:04.910
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: So, thank
you for saying it yourself.

00:34:04.910 --> 00:34:06.210
I thought, "Oh my gosh!

00:34:06.210 --> 00:34:07.510
I can't remember what they are."

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:08.810
[ Laughter ]

00:34:08.810 --> 00:34:13.150
Oddly enough, the first time I
met Michael he was chairing a

00:34:13.150 --> 00:34:16.200
meeting and he as -- and you
normally open a meeting with --

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:17.500
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yeah.

00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:18.800
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- reading
of the minutes, and blah,

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.100
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:34:20.100 --> 00:34:21.400
And he was -- he said, you know,

00:34:21.400 --> 00:34:23.150
"I'm going to start off
this meeting by talking

00:34:23.150 --> 00:34:25.880
about the four statements
that lead to wisdom."

00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:27.180
Audience: Ah!

00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:28.480
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And he paused
and he looked at everybody.

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:29.780
I said, "Oh, for God's sake!"

00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.200
And he just -- he said
those four things, paused,

00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:38.150
and then went on with
the rest of the meeting.

00:34:38.150 --> 00:34:40.010
And I thought, "Now there
is an extraordinary man."

00:34:40.010 --> 00:34:41.310
[ Laughter ]

00:34:41.310 --> 00:34:42.910
Audience: Ah, wonderful story.

00:34:42.910 --> 00:34:44.580
Thank you.

00:34:44.580 --> 00:34:46.110
Thank you so much.

00:34:46.110 --> 00:34:48.070
I started your books
last October.

00:34:48.070 --> 00:34:50.010
I finished them about
six weeks ago.

00:34:50.010 --> 00:34:51.460
[ Laughter ]

00:34:51.460 --> 00:34:55.480
I've brought a ton of friends
to Three Pines with me.

00:34:55.480 --> 00:34:57.890
We're having a Three
Pines party in December.

00:34:57.890 --> 00:35:00.010
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Oh beautiful!

00:35:00.010 --> 00:35:01.310
[ Laughter ]

00:35:01.310 --> 00:35:02.610
Audience: I'm so excited.

00:35:02.610 --> 00:35:03.910
When you wrote "Still
Life", how much did you know

00:35:03.910 --> 00:35:05.210
about these characters?

00:35:05.210 --> 00:35:06.630
With no spoilers!

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.930
Louise Penny: Right.

00:35:07.930 --> 00:35:09.670
How much did I know
about the characters

00:35:09.670 --> 00:35:11.910
when I started "Still Life"?

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:17.440
I certainly didn't know how
they were going to evolve.

00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:18.740
&gt;&gt; Audience: Okay.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.290
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: And that
I really -- I enjoy that --

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.250
and trying to leave
that relatively organic,

00:35:23.250 --> 00:35:31.380
and just in some ways
allowing them to take the path.

00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.840
Some guidance necessary,
but no it's --

00:35:33.840 --> 00:35:36.820
I didn't know where
they would go.

00:35:36.820 --> 00:35:38.220
I sort of thought of it.

00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:39.520
I knew it was going
to be a series

00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:40.820
and I wanted them to evolve.

00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:42.120
So, I sort of thought
of "Still Life"

00:35:42.120 --> 00:35:45.210
as the first cocktail
party where you go in

00:35:45.210 --> 00:35:46.510
and you meet a bunch of people.

00:35:46.510 --> 00:35:48.290
You think, "I think
they could be friends".

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:50.190
But you don't know a
great deal about them.

00:35:50.190 --> 00:35:51.780
You just know that
you like them.

00:35:51.780 --> 00:35:55.010
And then, the second book
is maybe that first lunch.

00:35:55.010 --> 00:35:56.310
[ Laughter ]

00:35:56.310 --> 00:35:59.630
And then, the third book, "Well,
let's have dinner together."

00:35:59.630 --> 00:36:00.930
And so, there's --

00:36:00.930 --> 00:36:02.230
[ Laughter ]

00:36:02.230 --> 00:36:03.530
-- there is an exposition
that happens --

00:36:03.530 --> 00:36:04.830
an evolution of intimacy.

00:36:04.830 --> 00:36:06.130
&gt;&gt; Audience: Well,
thank you very much.

00:36:06.130 --> 00:36:07.430
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:36:07.430 --> 00:36:08.980
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank you
so much for your books.

00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:10.730
I also grew up in Montreal

00:36:10.730 --> 00:36:12.570
and have been going
back more, and more.

00:36:12.570 --> 00:36:15.950
And I've been translating
a Yiddish poet who comes

00:36:15.950 --> 00:36:17.710
from [inaudible],
but lived in Montreal

00:36:17.710 --> 00:36:19.790
for a long time, Rachel Korn.

00:36:19.790 --> 00:36:24.890
And often, in her poems again
and again, Three Pines come up.

00:36:24.890 --> 00:36:26.190
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Really?

00:36:26.190 --> 00:36:30.470
&gt;&gt; Audience: They act as
guardians for her childhood home

00:36:30.470 --> 00:36:32.980
which she sort of mythologizes.

00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.960
So, when I read your books and
I read her poems it's like,

00:36:35.960 --> 00:36:40.740
"What is this with the, you
know, these Three Pine image?"

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:45.410
But my other question
is I go back again

00:36:45.410 --> 00:36:47.090
and again to Montreal.

00:36:47.090 --> 00:36:51.260
And I'm bilingual and
how do you navigate that?

00:36:51.260 --> 00:36:55.330
You have these characters with
names like Jean Luc and Gamache,

00:36:55.330 --> 00:36:57.740
but we're clearly
in English Canada.

00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:01.070
How does that -- how do
you think that through?

00:37:01.070 --> 00:37:05.220
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Well, I want to
give the sense of the bilingual

00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.520
and bicultural nature --

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:07.820
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Right.

00:37:07.820 --> 00:37:10.160
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- because I
think that's really rich and --

00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.460
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:12.760
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- rich ground.

00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.400
The question is ow much --

00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:17.210
for me anyway is how much
French to throw in --

00:37:17.210 --> 00:37:18.510
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:37:18.510 --> 00:37:19.810
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- so
that I get the sense of it

00:37:19.810 --> 00:37:22.410
because clearly, I don't --
I mean, I'm assuming you know

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.450
that when Gamache,
and Jean [inaudible],

00:37:24.450 --> 00:37:27.010
and Isabel [assumed spelling]
are together they're probably

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:28.310
talking French --

00:37:28.310 --> 00:37:29.610
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: Yeah.

00:37:29.610 --> 00:37:30.910
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: -- even though
I'm writing it in English

00:37:30.910 --> 00:37:35.010
because you would not be here if
I was writing the whole thing --

00:37:35.010 --> 00:37:36.310
[ Laughter ]

00:37:36.310 --> 00:37:37.610
-- in French.

00:37:37.610 --> 00:37:38.910
But that's what, you know, I
throw in a "wee", or [French],

00:37:38.910 --> 00:37:40.210
or [French], or something.

00:37:40.210 --> 00:37:41.510
And, you know, every now
and then I'll get an email

00:37:41.510 --> 00:37:43.240
from someone saying, "I
don't understand what these

00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.540
words mean.

00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:45.840
It's really annoying.

00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:47.140
[ Laughter ]

00:37:47.140 --> 00:37:48.710
Surely, you can figure it out.

00:37:48.710 --> 00:37:50.010
When -- when I was --

00:37:50.010 --> 00:37:51.310
[ Laughter ]

00:37:51.310 --> 00:37:53.900
When I was first writing
"Still Life" and there's a --

00:37:53.900 --> 00:37:57.010
I talk about a tuque -- a tuque.

00:37:57.010 --> 00:37:59.420
I didn't realize that
tuques are very Canadian

00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.220
and in fact, Quebec.

00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.350
And I would get -- I got an
email from my English editor

00:38:05.350 --> 00:38:08.230
in Britain -- in London
who said, "What's a tuque?"

00:38:08.230 --> 00:38:12.670
And I thought again, it's
like minus a gazillion out.

00:38:12.670 --> 00:38:15.060
They're putting something
on their head.

00:38:15.060 --> 00:38:17.100
[ Laughter ]

00:38:17.100 --> 00:38:18.400
"It's a refrigerator."

00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.010
Of course, what do you think
a tuque could possibly be?

00:38:20.010 --> 00:38:21.480
[ Laughter ]

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:22.780
So --

00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.230
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
We have time I'm afraid

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:27.600
for one more question.

00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.900
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny:
Oh, I'm so sorry --

00:38:28.900 --> 00:38:30.200
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan: I'm sorry.

00:38:30.200 --> 00:38:31.500
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: --
for answering two.

00:38:31.500 --> 00:38:34.010
&gt;&gt; Audience: I'll try to
make it a good one then.

00:38:34.010 --> 00:38:35.310
[ Laughter ]

00:38:35.310 --> 00:38:40.010
I'd like to ask you a little
bit about Ruth [inaudible].

00:38:40.010 --> 00:38:41.310
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:42.610
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Yeah.

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:43.910
[ Cheers and applause ]

00:38:43.910 --> 00:38:45.210
Every time I read one of
her poems, I am brought

00:38:45.210 --> 00:38:46.550
out for a moment thinking how
wonderful an example it is

00:38:46.550 --> 00:38:50.030
of a different voice than the
-- what else I am reading.

00:38:50.030 --> 00:38:53.350
It stands out as really
being a character to life.

00:38:53.350 --> 00:38:57.030
It's not just the author's
voice -- though obviously it is.

00:38:57.030 --> 00:38:58.470
So much so that I
even wonder sometimes

00:38:58.470 --> 00:39:00.360
if you got the poem
somewhere else.

00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:01.660
And I --

00:39:01.660 --> 00:39:02.960
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: I did.

00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.260
&gt;&gt; Audience: That's what
I would like to know --

00:39:04.260 --> 00:39:05.560
how do you find those poems

00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.860
and to what degree
has your writing --

00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:08.160
do you make it up right
there or do you have a list

00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:10.010
of Ruth poems somewhere else --

00:39:10.010 --> 00:39:11.310
[ Laughter ]

00:39:11.310 --> 00:39:13.420
-- somewhere else that
you come up with and stick

00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:14.730
in when you need them?

00:39:14.730 --> 00:39:16.030
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Well, I do.

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:18.420
When I write I have cookbooks
and poetry books beside me.

00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.930
And most of the Ruth [inaudible]
poems come from Margaret Atwood

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:25.860
from her "Morning in
the Burned House".

00:39:25.860 --> 00:39:27.440
Terrible! Oh my God!

00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:28.740
What a title!

00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.060
But it's a great,
slim volume of poetry.

00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.470
Just it's fabulous poems.

00:39:33.470 --> 00:39:35.690
So, when I'm writing -- and
I'm writing the next book

00:39:35.690 --> 00:39:36.990
now actually.

00:39:36.990 --> 00:39:39.040
And I was writing it this
morning in the hotel room

00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.810
and I'm thinking,
"God, this is --

00:39:40.810 --> 00:39:46.600
would be a great place for that
particular part of that poetry."

00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:50.490
So, that's -- Ruth is someone
who, you know, we all have a --

00:39:50.490 --> 00:39:52.970
[ Coughing ]

00:39:52.970 --> 00:39:55.970
-- our thankfully a
public face, right?

00:39:55.970 --> 00:39:59.260
In which we know that we say
polite things to each other

00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:01.060
and we keep our more --

00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:05.010
[ Laughter ]

00:40:05.010 --> 00:40:06.310
[ Coughing ]

00:40:06.310 --> 00:40:07.610
-- hideous thoughts
inside, you know.

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:08.910
"Yes, this is gorgeous
on me", you know.

00:40:08.910 --> 00:40:10.210
But God knows what
you're really thinking.

00:40:10.210 --> 00:40:11.510
[ Laughter ]

00:40:11.510 --> 00:40:12.810
And so, thank God we
have a public face.

00:40:12.810 --> 00:40:14.580
But Ruth was born inside out.

00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:15.880
&gt;&gt; Audience: I know.

00:40:15.880 --> 00:40:17.180
[ Laughter ]

00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:19.680
The challenge is not
making her a caricature.

00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.980
&gt;&gt; Audience: Yes.

00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:23.300
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: So, I really
appreciate that you all see her

00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:26.570
as a woman in full
and not as a --

00:40:26.570 --> 00:40:28.950
just a crotchety
old you know what.

00:40:28.950 --> 00:40:30.540
So, thank you for that.

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:31.840
That means a lot to me.

00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:33.210
&gt;&gt; Audience: Thank you.

00:40:33.210 --> 00:40:35.010
&gt;&gt; Maureen Corrigan:
Thank you, Louise Penny.

00:40:35.010 --> 00:40:36.640
[ Applause ]

00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:37.940
&gt;&gt; Louise Penny: Thank you.

00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.240
Thank you all.

00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:40.540
Thank you so much.

00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:41.840
Thank you.
