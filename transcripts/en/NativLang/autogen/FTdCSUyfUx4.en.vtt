brief note on translating into logic I
 

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:29.290
brief note on translating into logic I
realized that I never took the time to

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.300
realized that I never took the time to
 

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.970

process now it's a good time to slow the

00:00:34.389 --> 00:00:34.399
process now it's a good time to slow the
 

00:00:34.399 --> 00:00:35.950
process now it's a good time to slow the
pace down a bit and work through how to

00:00:35.950 --> 00:00:35.960
pace down a bit and work through how to
 

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.139
pace down a bit and work through how to
parse ordinary language in logical

00:00:38.139 --> 00:00:38.149
parse ordinary language in logical
 

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:40.239
parse ordinary language in logical
language then translate that logical

00:00:40.239 --> 00:00:40.249
language then translate that logical
 

00:00:40.249 --> 00:00:43.810
language then translate that logical
language into symbolic logic first make

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:43.820
language into symbolic logic first make
 

00:00:43.820 --> 00:00:45.220
language into symbolic logic first make
sure you understand the logic of the

00:00:45.220 --> 00:00:45.230
sure you understand the logic of the
 

00:00:45.230 --> 00:00:47.200
sure you understand the logic of the
sentence you're analyzing if your

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:47.210
sentence you're analyzing if your
 

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:49.360

break it down you're actually saying

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:51.260
break it down you're actually saying
 

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:53.079
break it down you're actually saying
that English is tough in that English is

then break the translation in stages

00:01:00.849 --> 00:01:00.859
then break the translation in stages
 

00:01:00.859 --> 00:01:03.340
then break the translation in stages
first reword the sentence and logical

clearly start putting the sentence into
 

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:13.749
clearly start putting the sentence into
logic figure out how many variables you

00:01:13.749 --> 00:01:13.759
logic figure out how many variables you
 

00:01:13.759 --> 00:01:16.149
logic figure out how many variables you
have and where to use them for all X if

00:01:16.149 --> 00:01:16.159
have and where to use them for all X if
 

00:01:16.159 --> 00:01:18.550
have and where to use them for all X if
X is English then X is tough and X is

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:18.560
X is English then X is tough and X is
 

00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:21.100

are also members of the set of dairy
 

00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:12.150
are also members of the set of dairy
products so the two sets intersect each

00:03:12.150 --> 00:03:12.160
products so the two sets intersect each
 

00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:12.599

products that's the intersection of the
 

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.580
products that's the intersection of the
two sets you can also speak of the union

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:20.590
two sets you can also speak of the union
 

00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.890
two sets you can also speak of the union
of the two sets this is the same concept

00:03:22.890 --> 00:03:22.900

includes every member of both sets let's

00:03:31.379 --> 00:03:31.389
includes every member of both sets let's
 

00:03:31.389 --> 00:03:33.089

aren't simply sets sets may have subsets

00:03:35.789 --> 00:03:35.799
aren't simply sets sets may have subsets
 

00:03:35.799 --> 00:03:38.520
aren't simply sets sets may have subsets
so ice cream ingredients are a subset of

00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:38.530
so ice cream ingredients are a subset of
 

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:41.400
so ice cream ingredients are a subset of
foods but what we really mean by this is

00:03:41.400 --> 00:03:41.410
foods but what we really mean by this is
 

00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.440
foods but what we really mean by this is
that ice cream ingredients and foods are

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:43.450
that ice cream ingredients and foods are
 

00:03:43.450 --> 00:03:45.300
that ice cream ingredients and foods are
two different sets so it's even more

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:45.310
two different sets so it's even more
 

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:47.190
two different sets so it's even more
