00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
One more concept that we're going to need is the idea of power.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is a word you've heard a lot like force or energy, but now, let's put a real definition to it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Power measures how quickly work can be done!

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
And what I mean by that is, let's say if two people and there's a pile of rocks.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
Let's say, this first person is more powerful than the second person.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Even though, if you give them bought a sufficient amount of time,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
they can move all these rocks up to, let's say, this basket here.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:28.000
If person 1 is more powerful, they'll do it faster.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:34.000
And so the equation for power is work divided by how long it takes to do that work, we call it Î”t.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000
Let's say this first person can lift one of these rocks,

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:43.000
one of these 2 kg rock, a height of 15 m in 30 secs, what is their power?

00:00:43.000 --> 99:59:59.000
The units of a power are watts. Watt is just another term for joules per second. Enter your answer here.
