00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:04.320
So here's a thought, right.

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:09.030
Communication is an
attempt at a transgression.

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.870
It's an attempt at
crossing over and entering

00:00:13.870 --> 00:00:17.120
the mind of the other,
or rather bringing

00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:19.790
the other into one's own mind.

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:22.400
Communication is an
attempt at a kind

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:27.870
of intersubjective
coherence, right.

00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:32.390
It's a means to achieve
a shared mutuality,

00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:37.570
to enter an intersubjective
space together.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:41.690
And I think that language is
one way to tell each other what

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:43.260
we mean, so to speak.

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:46.590
But when language
becomes visual,

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.619
right, then we can
show you what we mean.

00:00:48.619 --> 00:00:50.410
And one of the things
that Terence McKenna,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:52.300
the psychedelic
philosopher, talks about

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:54.470
is that virtual
reality technologies

00:00:54.470 --> 00:00:56.560
allow us to turn
our minds inside out

00:00:56.560 --> 00:01:02.040
in the very same ways that cave
paintings, early art, pottery,

00:01:02.040 --> 00:01:07.020
poetry allows us to turn our
interior world into something

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:09.330
that can be visibly beheld.

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:14.640
Language can be seen; I
can show you what I mean.

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:17.110
In new technological
paint brushes,

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:20.590
magic mirrors, electronic
devices, camera lenses,

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.050
like this, further
extend this capacity

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.130
to objectify our inner
world, to take the inside

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:30.060
and make it the outside.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:33.190
To show you what I mean
I can record this video,

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:35.230
I can play it for you,
and I can be over here

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.990
with you, beside myself,
showing you what I mean.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:45.100
And ultimately the desire
of the two of achieving this

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:48.870
is then to feel close to
the other person, to bond,

00:01:48.870 --> 00:01:53.970
to be able to share that
hinting recognition,

00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:58.180
to have that cosmic wink,
to know that we are both

00:01:58.180 --> 00:02:01.290
experiencing the same
thing at the same time

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.060
and you feel less alone and
you feel recognition again,

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.419
to say that again, and
it's a powerful thing,

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:11.540
right, to show each
other what we mean.

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:15.440
And I think that's the future
of communication technology,

00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:17.160
to further extend
this capacity, ,

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:21.326
this linguistic desire to
meld the minds together.
