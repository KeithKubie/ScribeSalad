00:00:01.676 --> 00:00:04.426
So today we're having a statewide training

00:00:04.546 --> 00:00:07.416
for guide dog puppy raisers for
the entire state of Arizona.

00:00:07.776 --> 00:00:12.466
We have five or six puppy raising
clubs in the state, and our Tucson club

00:00:12.516 --> 00:00:14.836
which is called Paws for
the Cause is hosting this.

00:00:15.186 --> 00:00:19.276
We do this about once a year, and
we have trainers for guide dogs come

00:00:19.696 --> 00:00:24.036
and help us puppy raisers learn and fine
tune our skills for raising our puppies.

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:29.276
The University has been really
supportive in a lot of students in helping

00:00:29.276 --> 00:00:33.106
to raise guide dog puppies, and my
professors are always really understanding.

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:39.146
Actually, Juan's been visiting our neuroscience
honors society club meetings and so all

00:00:39.146 --> 00:00:41.656
of the members recognize him
and love him and welcome him

00:00:41.656 --> 00:00:44.506
and they also really help in his socialization.

00:00:45.296 --> 00:00:49.766
Well in addition to our statewide training
today, the puppy truck has come from Guide Dogs,

00:00:49.896 --> 00:00:54.756
and this is a specially equipped van that
delivers puppies to new puppy raisers,

00:00:55.306 --> 00:01:01.436
and also our recall, so dogs that have
been with our puppy raisers for the past 12

00:01:01.636 --> 00:01:04.206
to 15 months are now going back to guide dogs

00:01:04.326 --> 00:01:07.296
to start their formal training
to become a working guide.

00:01:08.686 --> 00:01:13.556
It's kind of bittersweet, like
you know this day is coming,

00:01:13.816 --> 00:01:19.516
you know they're not your dog forever, but it's
kind of bittersweet that I'm not going home

00:01:19.566 --> 00:01:21.446
with the same dog I came with today.

00:01:23.466 --> 00:01:28.856
I love working with the dogs, but I love
knowing that the dog I've raised is going to go

00:01:28.856 --> 00:01:30.716
on to potentially change someone's life.

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:36.166
The first dog we raised was matched
with a young man that was 21 years old,

00:01:36.166 --> 00:01:41.176
and after he got a guide, he was able to move
out of his parent's home and live independently.

00:01:42.406 --> 00:01:45.986
So that's what makes it worthwhile
when you have to say goodbye.

00:01:47.486 --> 00:01:56.970
