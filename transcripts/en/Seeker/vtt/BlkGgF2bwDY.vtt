00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.190
DR. SAPNA PARIKH: Prescription
painkillers work really well.

00:00:03.190 --> 00:00:05.880
In fact, drugs like
oxycodone and hydrocodone

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:08.940
are actually the best when it
comes to medications for pain.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:10.110
But here's the problem.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.870
They make people feel great,
so naturally they want more.

00:00:12.870 --> 00:00:15.690
And also, they don't
just block pain signals.

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:18.150
They impact other parts
of your body, too.

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:21.056
The best painkilling
drugs are called opioids.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:22.680
Kind of a funny-sounding
word, but they

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:24.840
come from the opium in plants.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.520
Morphine and
codeine, for example,

00:00:26.520 --> 00:00:29.310
are naturally-occurring opiates,
but there are synthetics,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:30.300
as well.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:31.860
Opium comes from poppies.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:32.952
Think of The Wizard of Oz.

00:00:32.952 --> 00:00:34.410
Remember that scene
where they have

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:36.570
to run through a field
of bright red poppies

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.860
to get to Emerald City?

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.930
But Toto passes out,
and Dorothy's all,

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:41.310
like, I'm sleepy!

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:44.730
All these opioids work directly
on neurons in your brain.

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:47.520
They latch on to what are
called opioid receptors--

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:49.740
makes sense-- and
there are four types--

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:54.330
the mu, kappa, delta,
and the OFQ/N receptor.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.180
The mu receptor is the one
that most opioid prescription

00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:58.770
painkillers work on.

00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:00.870
It's that mu-receptor
activation that

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:03.510
blocks the perception
of pain and also causes

00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:04.830
the feelings of euphoria.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:07.980
Honestly, the mechanism of
action isn't fully understood.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.920
But when it comes to pain,
it's believed that opioids bind

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:14.820
to the receptor and block an
enzyme called adenylyl cyclase.

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.800
That makes the neuron
less likely to fire

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:19.290
and also affects the
release of neurotransmitters

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.130
like dopamine and GABA, which
impact how you perceive pain.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.210
But here's the catch--

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.790
the mu receptors aren't
just in the brain.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:29.010
These opioid receptors
are also on nerves

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:31.656
throughout the central and
peripheral nervous system.

00:01:31.656 --> 00:01:33.030
And that's why
these opioid drugs

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.420
cause a range of effects,
things like nausea, dry mouth,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.900
pinpoint pupils, itching,
even cough suppression.

00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.870
That's why there's codeine
in really strong cough syrup.

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:45.240
Because these painkillers,
they don't kill pain.

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:47.700
They activate
receptors everywhere.

00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.010
For example, the mu
receptors are also

00:01:50.010 --> 00:01:52.140
on nerves in the
digestive tract.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.910
Opioids slow things
down, but when

00:01:53.910 --> 00:01:57.120
it comes to the digestive tract,
you want to keep things moving.

00:01:57.120 --> 00:02:01.320
Opioids cause opioid-induced
constipation, or OIC,

00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:02.770
and it's a huge problem.

00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:04.890
In fact, after surgery,
doctors usually

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:08.093
prescribe painkillers and stool
softeners at the same time,

00:02:08.093 --> 00:02:09.509
because you're
going to need them.

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.967
But you don't want to take
these painkillers for too long--

00:02:11.967 --> 00:02:13.870
not just because
of constipation,

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:15.540
but because opioids
may literally

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:17.040
change the brain itself.

00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:19.290
Using opioids for a
long period of time

00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:21.900
causes neuroplastic
changes, or changes

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:24.810
in the brain connections
and pathways, in animals.

00:02:24.810 --> 00:02:27.330
And a couple of small studies
in humans found that taking

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:30.510
morphine every day for a month
reduces the amount of grey

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:32.750
matter in multiple
parts of the brain.

00:02:32.750 --> 00:02:35.700
Grey matter contains the
main bodies of neurons.

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.800
And physically changing
the brain is one thing,

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.990
but these painkillers can
also affect brain behavior.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.130
Another example-- normally your
body makes its own painkilling

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:46.020
compounds to soothe itself.

00:02:46.020 --> 00:02:47.940
You might know
them as endorphins.

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:51.350
Well, endorphins bind to
those same opioid receptors.

00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:53.100
Over time prescription
painkillers

00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:55.620
may stop the body from
making endorphins,

00:02:55.620 --> 00:02:59.010
because they keep these opioid
receptors constantly activated.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.080
So the body downregulates
the production

00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:04.530
of its own endorphins and you
may end up needing opioid drugs

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.300
just to be, well, "normal."

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:08.280
And these are just a
few examples of the ways

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.210
that opioids affect not just
the brain, but also the body.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:14.880
These painkillers are pretty
fascinating drugs that really

00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:16.590
work when it comes to pain.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:19.980
But now scientists are trying to
create more targeted drugs that

00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.270
don't hit receptors
all over the body, that

00:03:22.270 --> 00:03:25.640
don't have all the side effects,
and that don't cause addiction.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:28.080
We're not quite there yet,
but wouldn't that be great?
