00:00:06.690 --> 00:00:08.320
-Thank you so much, July.

00:00:08.320 --> 00:00:11.980
It is just such a treat to
get an introduction from Judy.

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.920
I've been waiting
all year for that.

00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.090
A note of gratitude
and recognition

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.430
for the Wampanoag,
Massachusetts, and area tribes

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:24.290
on whose land I'm
operating this talk.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.620
And of course, I'm deeply
grateful to Radcliffe, to Judy,

00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:33.030
to Sharon, Rebecca, Mervi--
[? quitos ?] to Mervi

00:00:33.030 --> 00:00:36.780
if she's here-- and everyone who
makes this amazing fellowship

00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:38.890
possible.

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:42.850
My research partner,
Kaipo, is here, Mira,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:46.430
and Christina, who've
truly been equals

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:48.720
as we delve into
historical research

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:52.960
and complex ethical
and cultural questions,

00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:57.580
and who've been a delight
to spend a year with.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:02.160
And a huge mahalo to
my fellow Fellows.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:05.280
Just every week I'm
dazzled, I'm inspired,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.870
and the world just keeps
enlarging and looking

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:10.890
completely new to me.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:13.010
Now I see the world,
and I see algorithms.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.656
I never saw algorithms before.

00:01:15.656 --> 00:01:16.920
Hydrogels.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:19.870
There's hydrogels in the world.

00:01:19.870 --> 00:01:21.600
And that's just
been such a treat,

00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.420
and it's been a year of
incredible learning and growth,

00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:26.910
so thank you so much.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:29.985
And finally, I want to
thank my dad for flying out.

00:01:29.985 --> 00:01:30.495
He's here.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:41.490
There is a Hawaiian idea
that we carry our ancestors

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:46.320
on our shoulders, and it's
not just me who's here.

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:52.830
It's my entire family and my
people, and that means a lot.

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:55.180
And my dad's physically
present, so that's a delight.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.680
I'm going to start this talk by
giving you a Hawaiian word that

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.710
will offer a sense of
structure and added

00:02:03.710 --> 00:02:06.690
meaning to the lecture
as well as branding

00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:10.889
the perspective of my work.

00:02:10.889 --> 00:02:14.390
That word is mo'olelo, and
it's up here on the slide.

00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.150
And it encompasses a lot of
meanings-- story, history,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:24.170
tradition, legend, a
yarn, a chronicle, a myth,

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:29.940
public record, private journal,
and a succession of a talk.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:34.150
So it holds a lot
in just one word.

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:37.790
It's rare I get to
give my writing context

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:41.330
and invite people into the
research and histories that

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.030
ground my creative work, so
this opportunity to engage

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:47.710
the multiple
meanings of mo'olelo,

00:02:47.710 --> 00:02:53.300
multiple disciplines, multiple
sources, is a real treat.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:57.190
Mo'olelo has, in its structure,
two other important words

00:02:57.190 --> 00:02:59.170
that matter to today's talk.

00:02:59.170 --> 00:03:02.780
There's mo', which means
succession, and can

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:05.590
refer to a geological line.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:10.615
And then olelo, which means
language, speech, an utterance,

00:03:10.615 --> 00:03:11.490
an oral presentation.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.040
This is the cover
of my first book,

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.860
which was published by
an imprint of Random

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.650
House in 2013.

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:24.740
The project I'm working on now
is titled To Weave with Water,

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.030
and it's a
multi-generational novel.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:31.480
It toggles between the early
20th and 21st centuries,

00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.070
and it's inspired by real
events that occur between 1903

00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:40.150
and then 2007 and 2008.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.330
Not only am I
weaving time periods,

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:45.100
but I'm also weaving
character perspectives.

00:03:45.100 --> 00:03:46.930
And there are four
central characters

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.200
whose interiority the
reader experiences, and I'll

00:03:50.200 --> 00:03:55.270
be reading from three of
those characters today.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:57.580
To ground this
talk, it make sense

00:03:57.580 --> 00:04:00.460
to start by looking at Hawaii.

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:02.820
It's an archipelago,
and when you're there,

00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.620
you're the farthest from
any continental land

00:04:05.620 --> 00:04:07.230
mass you can be.

00:04:07.230 --> 00:04:10.130
If you have flown
in to Honolulu,

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:13.630
to the capital, or Waikiki,
you've been on Oahu.

00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:15.980
If you've seen the
volcano, you've

00:04:15.980 --> 00:04:20.029
been on the island of
Hawaii, or big island.

00:04:20.029 --> 00:04:24.420
And if you're in the
world of my novel,

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:30.360
you're here on Maui,
especially this eastern side

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:33.250
of the island.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:36.970
I could tell you a lot about the
origins of the Hawaiian people.

00:04:36.970 --> 00:04:41.400
I can lecture on Austronesian
Migration Theory, or seafaring,

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:44.690
or the contemporary
revival of seafaring,

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:48.400
but I'm going to focus
on one origin story,

00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:53.360
and that's how Kanaka Maoli,
native Hawaiians-- that's

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.510
how they come into being,
and also their relationship

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:58.970
with kalo or taro.

00:04:58.970 --> 00:05:03.090
Taro, as probably most
of you know, is a tuber.

00:05:03.090 --> 00:05:06.090
It often has little-- it
can be purplish and have

00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.200
little things coming out of it.

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.720
We'll see a picture in a moment.

00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.970
It's an origin for
the Hawaiian people

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:19.170
and it also serves as an
origin story for my novel.

00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:21.965
He Kumulipo is a
genealogical account

00:05:21.965 --> 00:05:26.190
of the origins of
the Kanaka Maoli.

00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:31.070
One version of it, Wakea, Sky
Father, and Papahanaumoku,

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:34.000
Earth Mother, who,
in this cosmology,

00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:36.400
are both siblings
and spouses, are

00:05:36.400 --> 00:05:39.290
the parents of the
islands of Hawaii, Maui,

00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:40.630
and, later, Kauai.

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.160
And with different
partners, they'll

00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:45.650
actually birth the
other islands, as well.

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:49.010
They also give birth to a
daughter, Ho'ohokukalani,

00:05:49.010 --> 00:05:51.470
to generate stars in the sky.

00:05:54.820 --> 00:05:58.530
Wakea desires Ho'ohokukalani,
and, with her,

00:05:58.530 --> 00:06:03.100
produces Haloa-naka,
quivering long stock.

00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:07.510
But Haloa-naka is an
unformed fetus, a stillbirth,

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:12.730
and they grieve the loss of this
first child and they bury him.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:14.990
And from this place
where they bury

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:18.470
him sprouts the
first taro plant.

00:06:18.470 --> 00:06:22.540
The second child they have is
named Haloa, after his eldest

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:26.430
brother, and he's the
first Hawaiian Ali'i Nui

00:06:26.430 --> 00:06:31.420
and becomes the ancestor
of all the Hawaiian people.

00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.910
One of things that's so
moving to me in this narrative

00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.370
is that, from a moment of
profound grief and loss--

00:06:38.370 --> 00:06:42.410
the loss of a child--
something new, and sustainable,

00:06:42.410 --> 00:06:45.885
and really quite beautiful is
created for future generations.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.740
Now, there are multiple cultural
and historical metaphors

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:56.130
that arise from this
story, and I wrote up

00:06:56.130 --> 00:06:58.690
there recommended reading--
Lilikala's Native Land

00:06:58.690 --> 00:07:00.480
and Foreign Desires,
which delves

00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.110
into a number of
these metaphors.

00:07:03.110 --> 00:07:08.050
But the two I'm going to ask
you to remember for this talk

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:12.500
are, 1, the Kanaka Maoli
have a familial relationship

00:07:12.500 --> 00:07:13.660
to the land.

00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:17.210
And as family, we're asked
to malama 'aina, care

00:07:17.210 --> 00:07:18.820
for the land.

00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:24.140
And then 2, that Haloa, the
taro, is our older brother.

00:07:24.140 --> 00:07:28.910
And so we're also asked to care
for kalo-- taro-- and the lo'i,

00:07:28.910 --> 00:07:33.406
the taro patches
where the taro grows.

00:07:33.406 --> 00:07:35.030
Now, you might be
thinking, this sounds

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.520
like a really cool
cosmology, but what does

00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.540
it have to do with right now?

00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:43.140
The answer's a lot, still.

00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.020
The narrative about
Haloa-naka and Haloa

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.470
shapes our decisions, our
ethics and morals, our culture

00:07:49.470 --> 00:07:50.950
and tradition.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.000
And you see I've actually
used contemporary photos here

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.960
to illustrate just how
alive the taro and taro

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:02.460
farming is on the islands.

00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.010
Here are lo'i in Ke'anae
on the east side of Maui.

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:09.630
And here are taro.

00:08:09.630 --> 00:08:11.470
They're ready to clean and cook.

00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.130
And then here, Uncle Vince
Dodge is poi pounding.

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:18.640
He's pounding the
taro on a ku'i ai,

00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:22.600
a poi board that's made of
wood, with a po'haku ku'i ai,

00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:24.660
a stone for pounding.

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.230
And when you add water
to the pounded taro,

00:08:27.230 --> 00:08:28.390
that's when you get poi.

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:30.230
And that's the staple
of the Hawaiian diet.

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:37.239
OK, so we're going to hold
this present tense history,

00:08:37.239 --> 00:08:40.799
as I like to call
it, in one hand here,

00:08:40.799 --> 00:08:44.395
and we're going to travel back
in time to the 19th century.

00:08:47.100 --> 00:08:50.870
In 1819, the American
Board of Commissioners

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.840
for Foreign Missions,
the ABCFM, sends,

00:08:53.840 --> 00:08:56.470
out of Boston, its
first missionaries

00:08:56.470 --> 00:09:00.800
to the Hawaiian Islands, and
they arrive in March of 1820.

00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:05.330
So there's a really strong
tie between Boston and Hawaii.

00:09:05.330 --> 00:09:06.950
One of the strong
ties is actually

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:12.040
that Hawaii's water law is
based on Boston's water law.

00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.210
Fun facts also might matter
later-- just letting you know.

00:09:17.210 --> 00:09:19.410
Lahainaluna Seminary
is founded--

00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:20.970
a number of seminaries
are founded,

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:23.770
but Lahainaluna is the first.

00:09:23.770 --> 00:09:27.330
It considers itself the oldest
school west of the Rockies,

00:09:27.330 --> 00:09:29.220
founded in 1831.

00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.370
It's also my dad's alma mater.

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:34.600
And it houses the
first printing press

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:38.730
where the first Hawaiian
language newspaper is printed.

00:09:38.730 --> 00:09:42.130
By mid-century, Hawaii is one
of the most literate nations

00:09:42.130 --> 00:09:43.350
in the world.

00:09:43.350 --> 00:09:46.770
Some scholars think it was
the most literate nation

00:09:46.770 --> 00:09:49.630
in the world.

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:51.810
Now, the children
and grandchildren

00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:54.650
of the first missionaries
established sugar cane

00:09:54.650 --> 00:09:57.600
plantations, and
these are names that

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.240
might be familiar because they
have family ties on the East

00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.690
Coast, as well.

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:05.540
Alexander and Baldwin, Gay and
Robinson, Castle and Cooke,

00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:07.766
and of course Dole.

00:10:07.766 --> 00:10:10.580
And a lot of these
early plantations

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.590
now are huge corporations.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:16.410
The missionary families forced
the Hawaiian monarchy's hand.

00:10:16.410 --> 00:10:19.020
They pressed for the
privatization of land,

00:10:19.020 --> 00:10:23.140
and then they come to control
a large portion of it.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:25.850
Hawaiians are the first
plantation workers,

00:10:25.850 --> 00:10:29.170
but as their population
is decimated by disease,

00:10:29.170 --> 00:10:32.270
the plantation owners
begin to import workers.

00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:38.590
So in 1852, the Chinese arrived,
followed soon after by Japanese

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.050
and Portuguese.

00:10:40.050 --> 00:10:43.550
And then, in the
early 20th century,

00:10:43.550 --> 00:10:47.000
Okinawans, Koreans, Puerto
Ricans, and Filipinos

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.690
will follow.

00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:53.110
A strict plantation
hierarchy is maintained.

00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.770
So for example,
Portuguese workers,

00:10:55.770 --> 00:10:59.200
who are European in origin,
but have slightly darker

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:01.070
skin than the
American Missionary

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:03.640
descendants-- they're
allowed to be foremen.

00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:05.600
So they're above
the Asian settlers,

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.950
but they're below the
descendant owners.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.750
Pay scale, where
people live, what jobs

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:19.400
they're allowed to have--
all this is based on race.

00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:24.430
In 1893, these wealthy American
plantation owners stage a coup,

00:11:24.430 --> 00:11:27.150
and they overthrow
the Hawaiian monarchy.

00:11:27.150 --> 00:11:30.870
They imprisoned Queen
Liliuokalani in Iolani Palace.

00:11:30.870 --> 00:11:34.710
Grover Cleveland, US President
at the time, condemns the coup,

00:11:34.710 --> 00:11:37.680
but soon William McKinley
steps into office.

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:41.500
He negotiates a treaty with
the new Republic of Hawaii,

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:45.790
which is under Sanford B.
Dole, to use the Naval base

00:11:45.790 --> 00:11:51.380
at Pearl Harbor, as the Spanish
American War is looming.

00:11:51.380 --> 00:11:53.980
Annexation is fought
very strongly.

00:11:53.980 --> 00:11:57.940
98% of the Hawaiian
population, along with a number

00:11:57.940 --> 00:12:02.680
of Asian settlers, sign
anti-annexation petitions.

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:04.830
And this is an example
of one on the screen.

00:12:04.830 --> 00:12:11.320
And I found my family's
names on these, as well.

00:12:11.320 --> 00:12:15.630
But in 1898, US Congress
annexes the Hawaiian Islands.

00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.630
And it's in this moment
that my novel begins.

00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.190
It begins in 1903.

00:12:25.190 --> 00:12:27.440
A young Hawaiian
woman named [? Mele ?]

00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:30.315
has been schooled at the
Mauna'olu Female Seminary

00:12:30.315 --> 00:12:31.580
on Maui.

00:12:31.580 --> 00:12:35.490
It's a real place, though
she is a fictional character.

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:40.390
She's inspired by young women
like these pictured here.

00:12:40.390 --> 00:12:45.030
These photos are from a
female seminary in Honolulu.

00:12:45.030 --> 00:12:47.420
And much like these
young women, she

00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.760
is caught between worlds--
the Hawaiian culture

00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:54.430
and knowledge and language
of her early years,

00:12:54.430 --> 00:12:58.195
and the missionary education
of her preteen and adolescence.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.170
As the novel opens, she's 16,
one of the eldest at Mauna'olu,

00:13:06.170 --> 00:13:07.925
where she was sent
10 years prior,

00:13:07.925 --> 00:13:10.620
the year of the
overthrow, to be educated

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.110
in English, mathematics,
American history,

00:13:13.110 --> 00:13:15.070
and the domestic arts.

00:13:15.070 --> 00:13:19.310
But she's already 16, so
she's aging out of the school.

00:13:19.310 --> 00:13:21.620
And so she's faced
with a choice to either

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:26.560
return to her father and
the rural east side of Maui,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:29.620
or take a position
as a domestic servant

00:13:29.620 --> 00:13:31.855
for an American
plantation family.

00:13:37.660 --> 00:13:40.150
"Even if they were
born into poverty,

00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:43.790
Mele thinks, Mauna'olu
makes them rich.

00:13:43.790 --> 00:13:46.250
The taste for
oranges they develop.

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:50.530
The delight in fine lace,
which they learn to make.

00:13:50.530 --> 00:13:53.660
The hand-me-down scraps
of summer wool and velvet

00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:58.600
they used to fashion a collar,
are sew cuffs on a blouse.

00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.080
After years at school,
how can they ever

00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:04.140
return to the ways
of their parents?

00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:07.640
They no more wish to dip
their fingers in the poi bowl

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:12.320
than they desire to live
in a grass-thatched hale.

00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:16.170
When Mele last visited
her family years ago,

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:19.300
she found their living
quarters unseemingly,

00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:22.300
their closeness claustrophobic.

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:27.680
Bodies and skin, sticky with
salt. The breath, hot and damp,

00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.500
pressed against her
until, at last, she

00:14:30.500 --> 00:14:34.990
found respite in a corner far
from her father and grandmother

00:14:34.990 --> 00:14:38.050
and siblings.

00:14:38.050 --> 00:14:40.920
Mele remembers her first
night at Mauna'olu.

00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:42.890
How she peered
beneath her mattress

00:14:42.890 --> 00:14:45.510
to see the ropes
on which it rested,

00:14:45.510 --> 00:14:49.970
because she had never before
slept elevated from the ground.

00:14:49.970 --> 00:14:54.740
And how she poked at the pillow
to watch it exhale a feather.

00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:00.440
She felt herself singular then,
special, chosen, the child

00:15:00.440 --> 00:15:03.720
given to missionary schooling.

00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:06.840
That first morning, awaking
in her elevated bed,

00:15:06.840 --> 00:15:10.330
she had been dressed by one
of the graduates, a girl named

00:15:10.330 --> 00:15:14.640
Luka, who was the same
age then as Mele is now,

00:15:14.640 --> 00:15:19.070
and who gave her a blue
calico sash for her dress.

00:15:19.070 --> 00:15:21.960
Later, when the water
pumps failed, as they often

00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:25.050
did and still do, Luka
was asked to search

00:15:25.050 --> 00:15:29.460
for the buckets lost in the
cistern beneath the school.

00:15:29.460 --> 00:15:32.860
Mele held her breath
while the brave older girl

00:15:32.860 --> 00:15:34.810
descended into darkness.

00:15:34.810 --> 00:15:37.520
A splash, then silence.

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:40.500
One of the teachers pressed
Mele's face to her skirt

00:15:40.500 --> 00:15:44.320
as if she understood
Mele's fear.

00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:47.700
When Luka finally reemerged,
she had the expression

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.010
of a newborn.

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:51.660
Face squeeze tight
against the light,

00:15:51.660 --> 00:15:56.550
hands curled into fists, a
bucket hung from each forearm,

00:15:56.550 --> 00:15:58.950
and one from her left ankle.

00:15:58.950 --> 00:16:02.460
She had found three, not
just the missing two.

00:16:02.460 --> 00:16:05.760
Her dress clung to her sturdy
body, the nascent curves

00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.070
of womanhood beginning to show.

00:16:08.070 --> 00:16:09.880
How she was laughing.

00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.970
That's what Mele remembers most.

00:16:11.970 --> 00:16:13.530
Luka's open mouth.

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.090
Her white teeth,
straight and strong.

00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.930
The promise that here,
at Mauna'olu, everything

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:23.190
could always be made right.

00:16:23.190 --> 00:16:25.060
The girls followed Luka.

00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:28.320
Crowded into the doorway of
the kitchen, their curling

00:16:28.320 --> 00:16:31.220
laughter rising
upward, their fingers

00:16:31.220 --> 00:16:33.930
tugging at the
dress encasing her.

00:16:33.930 --> 00:16:37.620
Wet fabric peeled
from brown skin.

00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:41.350
Luka ran up the stairs in
just an underskirt and slip,

00:16:41.350 --> 00:16:44.740
and Headmistress gathered the
sopping clothing abandoned

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:49.010
on the kitchen floor, proclaimed
she would wash and dry it

00:16:49.010 --> 00:16:50.460
herself.

00:16:50.460 --> 00:16:52.830
'Such a brave girl,'
she told the others.

00:16:52.830 --> 00:16:57.120
'Such a good example
for all of you.'

00:16:57.120 --> 00:16:59.650
Now, years later,
Mele is the one

00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:02.520
who owns these
duties, who manages

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:05.359
the steaming basins
in the wash house,

00:17:05.359 --> 00:17:09.170
and goes searching for lost
buckets in the cistern.

00:17:09.170 --> 00:17:12.960
Mele, who's been chosen
to uphold tradition.

00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.390
If she leaves, who will
climb down the wooden ladder

00:17:16.390 --> 00:17:18.849
into the gaping
mouth of the earth?

00:17:18.849 --> 00:17:23.569
Who will pose above the water,
dress hems soaking in the cold?

00:17:23.569 --> 00:17:26.270
Who will know how
deep a breath to take?

00:17:26.270 --> 00:17:30.670
How to dive into darkness,
to swim with feet kicking,

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:34.190
descending farther and farther?

00:17:34.190 --> 00:17:36.850
In the cistern,
everything is black.

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:40.050
No up or down, no right or left.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:44.680
A girl who doesn't know better
might panic, drown even.

00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.850
Only Mele knows that when
you cannot figure which way

00:17:47.850 --> 00:17:49.970
to turn, hold still.

00:17:49.970 --> 00:17:53.760
Let the air in your
lungs carry you upward.

00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:58.630
If only every decision were this
easy, she thinks, this natural.

00:17:58.630 --> 00:18:04.000
Hold still and your body
will tell you what to do.

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:06.640
At the same time
that Mele is debating

00:18:06.640 --> 00:18:10.120
whether to return
home or not, East Maui

00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:14.390
is experiencing an influx
of Japanese workers

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:18.470
who've been hired to
construct the Ko'olau Ditch.

00:18:18.470 --> 00:18:22.590
Built between 1903 and
1904, the Ko'olau Ditch

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:25.830
extends the East Maui
Irrigation System

00:18:25.830 --> 00:18:29.760
deep into the rainy,
windward side of the island."

00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:34.990
And to give you a sense--
all these ditches were built

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:38.110
in the late 1800s,
and what they're doing

00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:40.620
is they're drawing water
from the windward side that

00:18:40.620 --> 00:18:43.920
gets a lot of rain into the
dry Central Valley, where

00:18:43.920 --> 00:18:45.920
sugar cane is grown.

00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:50.230
And they need the water not
only the water the cane fields,

00:18:50.230 --> 00:18:52.150
but also to mill it.

00:18:52.150 --> 00:18:55.640
And this line here
is the Ko'olau Ditch.

00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.810
Its construction was overseen by
Michael Maurice O'Shaughnessy,

00:19:03.810 --> 00:19:07.980
and he's the engineer who will,
upon his return from Hawaii,

00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:11.250
design the Hetch-Hetchy
project that brings water

00:19:11.250 --> 00:19:12.480
to the city of San Francisco.

00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:16.650
So this is really where
he makes his name.

00:19:16.650 --> 00:19:19.580
The Ko'olau Ditch is one of
the great feats of engineering,

00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:22.670
and there's tons of papers
about it from this time

00:19:22.670 --> 00:19:24.760
and in, actually,
like the next 50

00:19:24.760 --> 00:19:27.870
years that follow-- this
project and another project he

00:19:27.870 --> 00:19:30.930
did on Kauai.

00:19:30.930 --> 00:19:34.910
You have a sense, I think,
of the danger and the majesty

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:39.810
of this side of the island when
you look at this waterfall.

00:19:39.810 --> 00:19:41.580
The waterfalls are huge.

00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:45.410
Haleakala, the
mountain, is very steep.

00:19:45.410 --> 00:19:48.830
And on the east side of
Maui, the valleys and peaks

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.330
fold so tightly it's like
looking at an accordion.

00:19:54.550 --> 00:19:58.370
What you probably can't see is
that, up here on this bridge,

00:19:58.370 --> 00:20:02.630
which is going to connect
two tunnel mouths,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:08.260
are the tunnel men who
are building these tunnels

00:20:08.260 --> 00:20:10.800
and ditches and siphons--
this whole water

00:20:10.800 --> 00:20:13.370
system-- to draw this water
to the Central Valley.

00:20:17.590 --> 00:20:21.300
The tunnel men are almost
exclusively Japanese.

00:20:21.300 --> 00:20:25.560
There are a few Hawaiian crews,
and there's Portuguese luna.

00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:28.690
According to O'Shaughnessy,
the Japanese men

00:20:28.690 --> 00:20:31.000
are stronger than
the Chinese, more

00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.430
reliable than the
Hawaiians, and cheaper

00:20:33.430 --> 00:20:36.750
to pay than everybody else.

00:20:36.750 --> 00:20:40.440
And it's because of the lowest
in the plantation hierarchy.

00:20:40.440 --> 00:20:44.100
Tunnel mouths are exploded using
[? vigorate ?] powder, which

00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.280
they ship from San Francisco.

00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.770
They pack that into boreholes
with a fuse, and they light it.

00:20:50.770 --> 00:20:54.250
And they hope they
get away in time.

00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:56.810
The [? vigorate ?]
is highly explosive.

00:20:56.810 --> 00:21:00.800
Once they've opened up the
mouth, they then hand drill.

00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.360
And I mentioned up, I
think-- these tunnels

00:21:05.360 --> 00:21:15.800
can be 2,000-- the longest
one is 2,700 feet long.

00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:17.010
The shortest is 300.

00:21:17.010 --> 00:21:20.080
They average 1,000 feet.

00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:22.380
So they're really long.

00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:23.660
And that's really hard earth.

00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:31.570
[? Joji, ?] another fictional
character, is one such tunnel

00:21:31.570 --> 00:21:32.620
man.

00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:35.050
He's in charge of the
[? vigorate ?] powder, used

00:21:35.050 --> 00:21:37.690
to explode the entrances.

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:40.220
Just before the excerpt
I'm about to read,

00:21:40.220 --> 00:21:43.990
Joji's two closest friends
have died in an accident.

00:21:43.990 --> 00:21:46.740
A retaining wall has
collapsed and the tunnel

00:21:46.740 --> 00:21:49.390
they were working on flooded.

00:21:49.390 --> 00:21:53.920
"Joji and his protege,
Shota, survived the flood,

00:21:53.920 --> 00:21:57.080
but they witnessed
their friends drowning."

00:21:57.080 --> 00:22:01.600
One other character appears
here-- the okolehao man.

00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:04.280
Okolehao is the
Hawaiian word for swipe,

00:22:04.280 --> 00:22:10.740
so liquor made from, in this
case, ti root-- the ti plant.

00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:15.060
And the men call him Hao,
which is Chinese for good.

00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:17.630
So Hao is a Hawaiian
man who brews swipe,

00:22:17.630 --> 00:22:20.620
and he sells it in these
Japanese workers' camps.

00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:29.260
"The first time Joji buys drink,
Shota asks to come with him.

00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:30.880
They share a bottle.

00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:34.400
At the far edge of camp,
away from the luna's tents,

00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:37.290
they sit on bales of hay
meant for the donkeys who

00:22:37.290 --> 00:22:39.600
are tied up nearby.

00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:43.230
Some of the men draw a circle
in the dirt and throw dice.

00:22:43.230 --> 00:22:46.550
Others retire to a
quiet game of cards.

00:22:46.550 --> 00:22:51.500
But Joji and Shota stay with
Hao to listen to him talk.

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.780
He's a good storyteller-- not
just funny tales, but others.

00:22:55.780 --> 00:22:58.610
An avid fisherman,
once he caught a shark

00:22:58.610 --> 00:23:02.520
and thought he was Maui
himself pulling up new land.

00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:05.640
The island fought, its
body reflecting the sun

00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:08.580
in one moment, and
in the next, becoming

00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:11.020
a shadow beneath the water.

00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:15.620
But when Hao glimpsed a dorsal
fin, he realized what he had.

00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:17.980
'I cut the line,' he admits.

00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:20.150
'Sometimes you
have no fight left,

00:23:20.150 --> 00:23:22.580
but sometimes you
just respect the fight

00:23:22.580 --> 00:23:25.700
of another more than your own."

00:23:25.700 --> 00:23:29.610
Later, near the early
morning, Shota speaks.

00:23:29.610 --> 00:23:34.130
'Our friends are dead,' he
says, then goes silent again.

00:23:34.130 --> 00:23:35.590
His eyes are unfocused.

00:23:35.590 --> 00:23:39.240
His lips hang open,
their wet saliva

00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:42.350
gathering in the soft center.

00:23:42.350 --> 00:23:46.510
Hao does not make a joke,
does not reply with a story.

00:23:46.510 --> 00:23:48.420
'Tell me,' he says.

00:23:48.420 --> 00:23:52.390
And he listens as Shota
describes the cave, the water,

00:23:52.390 --> 00:23:54.680
the hours of waiting.

00:23:54.680 --> 00:23:57.880
Joji notices that Shota does
not mention the body that

00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:59.720
floated beneath them.

00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:04.820
They have not spoken of it with
anyone, not even each other.

00:24:04.820 --> 00:24:07.670
Shota is crying, and
Joji, embarrassed,

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:09.240
does not know what to do.

00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.080
But Hao understands.

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.970
He tucks his hand beneath
Shota's good arm, lifts him up.

00:24:14.970 --> 00:24:18.200
'Let's walk you to
the bunk house.'

00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:20.540
Joji returns with
increasing frequency,

00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.520
but Shota refuses
to go back to Hao.

00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:28.560
'That drink hurts going down
and coming back up,' Shota says.

00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:33.280
He adds, 'remember, Susuma and
Habiki did not like this man,

00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:35.510
or his drink.'

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:37.210
Joji does not listen.

00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.460
After all, the drink is
what allows him to sleep.

00:24:40.460 --> 00:24:43.020
At the end of a
shift, the okolehao

00:24:43.020 --> 00:24:46.130
loosens the shoulders,
the legs, the mind.

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:51.170
Joji feels warm, easy, as if
swimming in a summertime pond.

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.470
Later, his mouth
is that of a fish.

00:24:53.470 --> 00:24:55.300
Map, map, map.

00:24:55.300 --> 00:25:00.580
He cannot control it as
it opens, closes, opens.

00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.060
Swipe in the morning comes next
to keep the headache at bay,

00:25:04.060 --> 00:25:08.830
to moisten his wooden tongue,
to steady his shaking hands.

00:25:08.830 --> 00:25:11.760
He can never be second-day
drunk if he is always

00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:14.540
on the first day of drinking.

00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:16.750
And anyway, he
needs to stay sharp

00:25:16.750 --> 00:25:19.170
if he is to help
with the next tunnel.

00:25:19.170 --> 00:25:21.550
The boreholes must be
drilled into the rock,

00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.130
the [? vigorate ?] powder
measured and packed

00:25:24.130 --> 00:25:27.690
with accuracy, the fuse
given enough length.

00:25:27.690 --> 00:25:30.220
And then he must
have dependable hands

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:34.680
to light the cord,
nimble feet to walk away.

00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.990
Here, there are few
curves in the mountainside

00:25:36.990 --> 00:25:39.230
to hide behind, so
the diggers build

00:25:39.230 --> 00:25:41.980
a trench fronted by a berm.

00:25:41.980 --> 00:25:45.470
Once, Joji trips over it,
lands in someone's arms

00:25:45.470 --> 00:25:48.160
as the [? vigorate ?]
powder blows.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.110
That night, he
crafts his retelling

00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:53.020
as if his story were frivolity.

00:25:53.020 --> 00:25:55.340
'The booming that
followed, I never know

00:25:55.340 --> 00:25:58.390
if it's the explosion
or my headache.'

00:25:58.390 --> 00:25:59.960
Hao laughs at that.

00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:02.410
The other men, too.

00:26:02.410 --> 00:26:04.970
Joji asks Hao what
it feels like to him

00:26:04.970 --> 00:26:07.750
when the tunnels
are blasted open.

00:26:07.750 --> 00:26:09.825
'Down in the native
village, what do they say

00:26:09.825 --> 00:26:14.080
of what's being done
to their mountainside?'

00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:17.295
'The boom comes as a feeling
in the feet,' Hao says.

00:26:17.295 --> 00:26:19.470
'A trembling at the knees.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:21.700
It comes as a
weakness in the earth,

00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:25.180
then up the length of the body.'

00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:28.260
'How you know that not the
hangover?' someone calls out,

00:26:28.260 --> 00:26:29.260
and Hao laughs.

00:26:29.260 --> 00:26:31.450
'I never know.'

00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.600
The nights are
all like this one.

00:26:33.600 --> 00:26:36.130
The campfire burning
low, so the men's faces

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.900
are lost, only their
knuckles showing,

00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.040
highlighted as they grip their
glass bottles or metal cups.

00:26:43.040 --> 00:26:48.400
He thinks, each man is lost
in a cave of his own digging.

00:26:48.400 --> 00:26:49.790
Shota's shoulder is healing.

00:26:49.790 --> 00:26:52.640
He is already back at
work on the road crew,

00:26:52.640 --> 00:26:55.690
using his good arm
to help lay rock.

00:26:55.690 --> 00:26:57.820
Joji finds ways to
avoid him now that they

00:26:57.820 --> 00:27:00.900
are in different crews,
but he misses the boy,

00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:04.780
even as he is ashamed
when Shota spies him.

00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.280
One morning, Shota catches him
on the road between shifts.

00:27:08.280 --> 00:27:11.030
'Sansei," Shota calls
out, the old nickname

00:27:11.030 --> 00:27:13.130
rising like a reproach.

00:27:13.130 --> 00:27:17.750
'You look sick.' The boy's
country Chugokuan accent

00:27:17.750 --> 00:27:21.200
reminds Joji of how he is
surrounded by bumpkins.

00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.900
What does Shota know
of illness or grief?

00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:29.640
'Feeling fine," Joji presses
on, but Shota chases after him.

00:27:29.640 --> 00:27:33.230
'Sansei, you cannot keep
on with the okolehao.'

00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.180
'I'm not keeping on.'

00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:39.650
'But you are.' The boy is at his
elbow, clinging like seaweed.

00:27:39.650 --> 00:27:41.580
He shakes him off.

00:27:41.580 --> 00:27:45.400
'I just want my friend
back,' the boy murmurs.

00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:46.680
Joji turns.

00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:48.750
Shota's left arm is
still on a sling,

00:27:48.750 --> 00:27:50.900
but the other has
grown muscular.

00:27:50.900 --> 00:27:54.990
His neck has new veins,
a taut line of strength.

00:27:54.990 --> 00:27:57.670
The boy has been
keeping his hair short.

00:27:57.670 --> 00:28:00.830
Who has been cutting it
for him, if not Joji?

00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:03.750
And he looks older,
handsome even.

00:28:03.750 --> 00:28:06.770
His expression is
one of deep sadness.

00:28:06.770 --> 00:28:08.970
'No more,' he says.

00:28:08.970 --> 00:28:10.260
Shota is not begging.

00:28:10.260 --> 00:28:11.370
Not even asking.

00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:14.020
He is willing it to be so.

00:28:14.020 --> 00:28:15.090
'No more.

00:28:15.090 --> 00:28:17.010
None.'

00:28:17.010 --> 00:28:20.140
Joji stumbles away from
him toward the tunnel,

00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:23.440
toward another day of
digging through darkness.

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:25.630
The whirring noise
of the handrails

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:28.040
drowns the ringing in the ears.

00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:29.760
More, he thinks.

00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:30.710
More swipe.

00:28:30.710 --> 00:28:31.830
More stories.

00:28:31.830 --> 00:28:33.090
More laughter.

00:28:33.090 --> 00:28:34.517
More Hao.

00:28:34.517 --> 00:28:35.100
More okolehao.

00:28:37.930 --> 00:28:40.610
The next night, Joji
invites Hao to share

00:28:40.610 --> 00:28:42.970
his dinner-- some rice and ume.

00:28:42.970 --> 00:28:45.680
And the night after that,
Hao bring sweet potato paste,

00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:48.300
made rich with coconut milk.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.090
They eat together, a
flat rock their table.

00:28:51.090 --> 00:28:53.810
Above them, the stars
are crystalline.

00:28:53.810 --> 00:28:57.770
A rare night like this
has beauty, brightness.

00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:01.700
Joji remembers one such in
Yokohama, how the moon glinted

00:29:01.700 --> 00:29:04.270
off the ocean, and
his father pointed

00:29:04.270 --> 00:29:08.580
to the outline of a Dutch
trading ship in the distance.

00:29:08.580 --> 00:29:11.210
Joji has never told
anyone about this moment.

00:29:11.210 --> 00:29:12.450
The thrill of it.

00:29:12.450 --> 00:29:16.130
The possibility of that
single clipper, its sails

00:29:16.130 --> 00:29:19.150
set ablaze by the aquatic moon.

00:29:19.150 --> 00:29:20.840
Hao listens.

00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:23.080
He speaks of his own life, too.

00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.280
His one living child
in seminary school.

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:29.580
He has lost a baby girl, the
youngest, to bubonic plague,

00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:32.120
and two sons to scarlet fever.

00:29:32.120 --> 00:29:35.210
His wife was sent
to the leper colony.

00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:37.110
Illness is a specter
in his life--

00:29:37.110 --> 00:29:41.820
a malevolent spirit he and
his people cannot shake.

00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:44.400
Yet he finds delight
in the water,

00:29:44.400 --> 00:29:48.840
in the streams that run from
the mountains to the ocean.

00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:53.900
'I grow my kalo with that water,
my sweet potatoes,' Hao says.

00:29:53.900 --> 00:29:56.440
'I bathe my mother
with that water.'

00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:00.490
'Bathe her?' Joji repeats,
and then immediately is sorry.

00:30:00.490 --> 00:30:04.060
Hao's features squeeze
the center of his face.

00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.360
'She is ill, but the
water makes her happy.

00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:11.100
On a good day, she can sit in
the stream, splash herself.

00:30:11.100 --> 00:30:14.350
On the bad days, I
wipe her in our hale.

00:30:14.350 --> 00:30:15.590
I feed her.

00:30:15.590 --> 00:30:17.300
She is like an infant.

00:30:17.300 --> 00:30:21.460
She suckles my finger
when I dip it in poi.'

00:30:21.460 --> 00:30:26.330
Joji cannot imagine caring
for a grown human in this way.

00:30:26.330 --> 00:30:30.480
'I feel alone,' Hao admits,
his words heavy. 'I am alone.

00:30:30.480 --> 00:30:33.020
My daughter refuses to return.

00:30:33.020 --> 00:30:34.690
She thinks I want money.

00:30:34.690 --> 00:30:35.580
I have a business.

00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:37.240
Why would I want money?

00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.690
I want her here with me.

00:30:38.690 --> 00:30:41.850
I want her with her family.'

00:30:41.850 --> 00:30:44.340
Joji nods as if he understands.

00:30:44.340 --> 00:30:46.130
He feels sorry for
Hao, and that makes

00:30:46.130 --> 00:30:48.310
him feel sorry for himself.

00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:51.470
He is without family,
without company.

00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:54.200
Sosume and Habiki are dead.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.990
The self-pity sweetens
his drink somehow.

00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:01.490
Shoto arrives hance the
edge of the campfire.

00:31:01.490 --> 00:31:03.940
'Tell them,' Joji calls to him.

00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:06.580
'Tell them how we saw
Sosume and Habiki.

00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.600
Tell them how we saw
the body at the end.'

00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.860
Shota shakes his head, refuses.

00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:13.660
Joji feels angry.

00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:15.670
Why will the boy not tell Hao?

00:31:15.670 --> 00:31:18.180
Why will he not
tell all of them?

00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.820
Joji wants everyone to
know what he's endured.

00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:23.660
Shota is speaking,
but he's not saying

00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.650
what Joji wants him to say.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.950
Joji stands, stumbles
toward the boy.

00:31:27.950 --> 00:31:29.860
Hao is on his feet, too.

00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:32.940
Shota is telling
him, 'be quiet, now.'

00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:35.840
'Get away from me,
you,' Joji yells.

00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:39.600
He kicks dirt at the fire, but
his words are meant for Shota.

00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:40.500
'Get away.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:41.690
You're insincere.

00:31:41.690 --> 00:31:43.570
You're a boy who
doesn't understand.

00:31:43.570 --> 00:31:48.090
You have no virtues.'

00:31:48.090 --> 00:31:50.130
He awakes much later.

00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:52.820
His body is hot and
shivering at once.

00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:55.240
His sweat has an animal scent.

00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:59.200
He wants to bathe, to leap into
a deep, cold pool of water,

00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.980
but he's still drunk.

00:32:00.980 --> 00:32:04.490
And he knows if he
stands, he'll fall over.

00:32:04.490 --> 00:32:06.930
He remembers Shota
saying to keep quiet.

00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:08.520
Not to speak.

00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:12.660
And he understands now why
the boy kept hushing him.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:15.720
Gaman, the quiet endurance
that has marked him

00:32:15.720 --> 00:32:18.580
as someone worthy of respect.

00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:21.806
After last night, no longer so.

00:32:21.806 --> 00:32:27.140
The hair at his neck
clings damply to his skin.

00:32:27.140 --> 00:32:29.120
A few hours later
he awakes again,

00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.890
this time with a sick
sensation in his stomach.

00:32:31.890 --> 00:32:34.680
He is sick from the words
of the night before.

00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:37.550
He insulted Shota when
the boy was only trying

00:32:37.550 --> 00:32:41.440
to help him keep his dignity.

00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:45.470
Joji drags himself
upright, exits the tent.

00:32:45.470 --> 00:32:47.080
At the end of his
row is a washbasin

00:32:47.080 --> 00:32:49.050
where he splashes his face.

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:52.830
He decides, as pennance, to
go without drink for the day.

00:32:52.830 --> 00:32:55.360
He will make it up
to Shota in that way.

00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:58.570
He will suffer through the
shaking hands and pounding head

00:32:58.570 --> 00:33:01.900
and rasping cough,
unsoothed by the swipe,

00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:04.130
and all this will
make him virtuous,

00:33:04.130 --> 00:33:05.960
worthy of forgiveness.

00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.080
He will go to the boarding
house in the evening

00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.690
and find Shota and
apologize, and the boy

00:33:10.690 --> 00:33:15.680
will see he has been clean
all day, and forgive him.

00:33:15.680 --> 00:33:17.780
On the walk to the
tunnel, he keeps his hands

00:33:17.780 --> 00:33:21.500
in his pocket to
quell the shaking.

00:33:21.500 --> 00:33:24.410
Today, they need the backside
of tunnel 11 blasted,

00:33:24.410 --> 00:33:26.560
so he prepares the powder.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.080
He is slow and careful as ever,
but his hands are unsteady.

00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:33.730
Twice he drops a portion
of the [? vigorate ?]

00:33:33.730 --> 00:33:37.500
has to gather the red earth
on which it fell, toss it

00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:39.460
over the side of the cliff.

00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:43.260
Diluted, it will not
accidentally explode.

00:33:43.260 --> 00:33:44.890
He's sweating again.

00:33:44.890 --> 00:33:48.130
His shirt damp, his
armpits squeaky.

00:33:48.130 --> 00:33:52.120
He lights the fuse at last
and turns to walk away,

00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.190
his tread careful.

00:33:54.190 --> 00:33:56.770
He stumbles, feet
mismanaged by the brain,

00:33:56.770 --> 00:33:59.710
and plunges forward,
catches himself.

00:33:59.710 --> 00:34:03.410
He has to pause to sort
his legs, his torso.

00:34:03.410 --> 00:34:07.560
The luna, voice soft and
cautious because of the powder,

00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:12.969
hisses, 'come, Jo, come.' The
urgency and fear in his voice

00:34:12.969 --> 00:34:15.100
is palpable.

00:34:15.100 --> 00:34:18.800
Joji pushes himself to the
berm, one foot after the next.

00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:20.420
He wonders if his
shoes are untied,

00:34:20.420 --> 00:34:22.920
if he has time to retie them.

00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:23.560
He pauses.

00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:25.495
The luna's face is pale.

00:34:25.495 --> 00:34:28.639
The man ducks
behind the hillock.

00:34:28.639 --> 00:34:30.889
Joji clamors over
into the trench.

00:34:30.889 --> 00:34:34.139
And then the boom, the
raining of rocks-- how they

00:34:34.139 --> 00:34:36.510
make that scattering noise.

00:34:36.510 --> 00:34:39.710
He looks up at plant roots
overturned, bristling

00:34:39.710 --> 00:34:41.639
from the bank of earth.

00:34:41.639 --> 00:34:44.400
He stands again,
legs steadier now.

00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.830
Mind, too.

00:34:45.830 --> 00:34:47.989
He climbs back over the berm.

00:34:47.989 --> 00:34:51.429
He moves quickly, wants
to be the first there.

00:34:51.429 --> 00:34:55.050
Not his usual calm,
his usual patience.

00:34:55.050 --> 00:34:59.230
He knows the sound was different
this time-- shallower, shorter.

00:34:59.230 --> 00:35:02.850
He wonders if they've
hit another lava tube.

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.790
He will apologize to Shota
after this shift ends.

00:35:05.790 --> 00:35:08.740
He went too far last
night, spoke to freely.

00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:11.570
The okolehao brings
that out of him.

00:35:11.570 --> 00:35:13.680
He'll take a night or
two off from the swipe,

00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:16.400
return to it with
greater control.

00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:21.380
He steps forward to study the
rock, its angle of sheering.

00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:24.400
Far to his right
is a trail of cord.

00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:27.710
His mind is slow to
respond to what it means--

00:35:27.710 --> 00:35:30.420
the borehole unexploded.

00:35:30.420 --> 00:35:34.610
He reaches his hand forward as
if he could re-pack the powder.

00:35:34.610 --> 00:35:46.560
His fingers graze the rock,
and then the world convulses."

00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:50.610
And now we jump 100
years in the future.

00:35:54.450 --> 00:36:00.000
By the late 20th century,
Alexander N. Baldwin, or ANB,

00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.670
the last sugar cane
plantation on Maui,

00:36:02.670 --> 00:36:05.860
and soon to be the last
in all the islands,

00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.730
through their subsidiary,
East Maui Irrigation, EMI,

00:36:09.730 --> 00:36:16.540
has diverted over 100 East Maui
streams collected on 33,000

00:36:16.540 --> 00:36:19.220
acres of conservation lands.

00:36:19.220 --> 00:36:21.940
And they use this water to
irrigate their sugar cane

00:36:21.940 --> 00:36:27.300
fields, which is managed by
another ANB subsidiary, HCNS,

00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:30.200
Hawaiian Commercial and Sugar.

00:36:30.200 --> 00:36:34.810
In the mid-1990s, a group
of East Maui taro farmers,

00:36:34.810 --> 00:36:39.115
gatherers, and fishers, form a
group called Na Moku Aupuni O

00:36:39.115 --> 00:36:41.810
Ko'olau Hui.

00:36:41.810 --> 00:36:43.590
It's a community
organization that,

00:36:43.590 --> 00:36:45.850
with the native
Hawaiian legal core,

00:36:45.850 --> 00:36:50.160
sues ANB and EMI for their
constitutional rights

00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.770
to access water and
pursue Hawaiian traditions

00:36:53.770 --> 00:36:58.260
and customs dependent
on free-flowing streams.

00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:03.240
The Ko'olau Ditch is the
center of that lawsuit.

00:37:03.240 --> 00:37:06.952
Here's a view of the
East Maui town, Ke'anae.

00:37:06.952 --> 00:37:10.050
I took this photo, and
I'm standing on the road.

00:37:10.050 --> 00:37:15.060
And not far behind me is one
of the Ko'olau Ditch intakes.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.440
You can see here
the lo'i, the taro

00:37:17.440 --> 00:37:21.180
patches-- one being farmed here.

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:27.160
You can also see where they've
had to let their lo'i go,

00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:29.455
and just be grown
over with grass

00:37:29.455 --> 00:37:34.370
because they don't have
the water to plant them.

00:37:34.370 --> 00:37:37.360
This very real
lawsuit is actually

00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:41.180
what first drew me to the
subject matter of my novel.

00:37:41.180 --> 00:37:43.810
Later, I did this
historical research.

00:37:43.810 --> 00:37:46.640
So the bulk of this talk
came much later, actually.

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:50.480
But first and foremost
were these taro farmers.

00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.530
Now, all my writing
circles around questions.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:55.420
I don't write because
I know something.

00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:56.950
I write because
I'm really trying

00:37:56.950 --> 00:37:59.290
to understand it, and
especially understand

00:37:59.290 --> 00:38:03.630
it personally and emotionally
as well intellectually.

00:38:03.630 --> 00:38:07.750
So this lawsuit, which is about
water rights and native rights,

00:38:07.750 --> 00:38:11.470
has, for me, a very
deep, human component.

00:38:11.470 --> 00:38:15.170
Several of the lead plaintiffs
grew up with my dad and uncle

00:38:15.170 --> 00:38:17.920
and were classmates
with my dad and uncle.

00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:22.170
When the lawsuit starts,
they're in their 50s.

00:38:22.170 --> 00:38:23.960
They're not young guys.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:26.240
They're starting to
complain about the arthritis

00:38:26.240 --> 00:38:28.670
in their knees and they're
feeling a little creaky.

00:38:28.670 --> 00:38:32.320
Maybe they're losing some hair.

00:38:32.320 --> 00:38:36.180
And they don't fit the image
of people who are radical,

00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.350
but what they do is radical.

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.610
At this point, in the
late 90s, early 2000s,

00:38:42.610 --> 00:38:45.870
ANB is the single
largest employer on Maui.

00:38:45.870 --> 00:38:47.760
They own Matson
Shipping Lines, which

00:38:47.760 --> 00:38:51.550
is how Hawaii gets its food,
its clothing, its building

00:38:51.550 --> 00:38:53.390
materials, it's everything.

00:38:53.390 --> 00:38:56.190
They have connections in
every level of the government,

00:38:56.190 --> 00:38:59.520
and a close connection
to the governor herself.

00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.890
So when these Hawaiians
stand up to all that,

00:39:02.890 --> 00:39:06.490
their litigation
challenges and reorients

00:39:06.490 --> 00:39:09.710
not only the present moment,
but an entire history

00:39:09.710 --> 00:39:10.865
of plantation colonialism.

00:39:14.710 --> 00:39:17.380
There are definitely other
Hawaiians and community groups

00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:22.730
doing amazing work in the same
period, and earlier, and since,

00:39:22.730 --> 00:39:27.490
but this group is moving to me
because their narrative is also

00:39:27.490 --> 00:39:30.290
tied to the Haloa narrative.

00:39:30.290 --> 00:39:32.480
Remember, they're taro farmers.

00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:36.890
So they're taking from a
moment of grief and loss--

00:39:36.890 --> 00:39:39.600
for more than a century
of grief and loss--

00:39:39.600 --> 00:39:42.950
and creating something
new and sustainable

00:39:42.950 --> 00:39:45.360
for future generations.

00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:48.260
So in this final
excerpt, I'm going

00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:52.860
to focus on the fictional
character Henry.

00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:55.610
he's retired when
this excerpt begins.

00:39:55.610 --> 00:39:59.310
He grows kalo in a town on
the eastern side of Maui

00:39:59.310 --> 00:40:02.510
that might look much like this.

00:40:02.510 --> 00:40:04.930
And he's involved in
a lawsuit inspired

00:40:04.930 --> 00:40:08.470
by the one I just described.

00:40:08.470 --> 00:40:11.460
To orient you,
Ellen is his wife.

00:40:11.460 --> 00:40:13.700
His daughter is Kolea.

00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.590
And he had a son, too,
whose name was Pue'o,

00:40:17.590 --> 00:40:21.060
and who disappeared 10
years prior to this excerpt.

00:40:21.060 --> 00:40:23.130
His body's never
been found, but it's

00:40:23.130 --> 00:40:26.370
thought he died cliff or
bridge jumping somewhere

00:40:26.370 --> 00:40:27.990
along the Irrigation System.

00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.320
"The baby tries, Henry thinks.

00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:39.320
He sees her bare arms, the
tight muscles of them, the way

00:40:39.320 --> 00:40:42.140
her shoulder muscles
gleam in the sun.

00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:44.760
She's working hard in the lo'i.

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:49.760
When she bends over, her back
stooped, her eyes squinting,

00:40:49.760 --> 00:40:52.050
she reminds him
of his grandmother

00:40:52.050 --> 00:40:56.410
who, at the end of her life,
watched him like a coiled eel

00:40:56.410 --> 00:40:58.340
in her bed.

00:40:58.340 --> 00:41:00.510
Funny how he connects
the old woman

00:41:00.510 --> 00:41:05.660
to his daughter who is still
young and open to the world.

00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:08.820
'Time for eat,' he
calls out to Kolea.

00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:12.390
She waves to let him know she
heard, but she doesn't stop.

00:41:12.390 --> 00:41:15.840
She has a way of holding off
simple pleasures in the name

00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.750
of completing a task.

00:41:17.750 --> 00:41:21.700
She is fierce in this respect,
a harder worker than anyone

00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.840
he knows, himself included.

00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:28.740
From the dried grass ground,
she lifts each oha and murmurs

00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.860
to it.

00:41:29.860 --> 00:41:33.970
He has never asked her
what she says to the corm,

00:41:33.970 --> 00:41:36.860
has never wanted her
to feel embarrassed,

00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:40.640
to stop speaking to the
taro the way she does.

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.430
He is convinced the
kalo hears her, listens,

00:41:44.430 --> 00:41:48.490
wants to survive to
hear her voice again.

00:41:48.490 --> 00:41:51.070
Henry slips his knife
beneath the skin of a mango

00:41:51.070 --> 00:41:54.320
and cuts a spiral around the
fruit until the exterior comes

00:41:54.320 --> 00:41:56.570
off in a single coil.

00:41:56.570 --> 00:41:58.460
Then he cuts himself
a slice, chews

00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:01.490
it, the flesh
sweet and unctuous,

00:42:01.490 --> 00:42:03.950
the juice on his hands.

00:42:03.950 --> 00:42:07.800
Watching Kolea, he feels
the old worry rise,

00:42:07.800 --> 00:42:10.740
a tide slow and predictable.

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:13.320
He still can't, after
all these years,

00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:15.640
stop himself from worrying.

00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:17.970
Ellen doesn't
worry like he does.

00:42:17.970 --> 00:42:21.160
Ellen understands, now
that Kolea is a woman,

00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:24.180
how to relate to her as such.

00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:26.220
The two of them--
those two women

00:42:26.220 --> 00:42:29.570
circling each
other in his house.

00:42:29.570 --> 00:42:33.840
But here, in the lo'i, Kolea
is both woman and child,

00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:36.590
and when the sun shimmers
in the noonday sky,

00:42:36.590 --> 00:42:40.260
he thinks he sees his little
girl splashing in the water,

00:42:40.260 --> 00:42:42.160
planting her first kalo.

00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:44.470
Taking his hand when
the police told them

00:42:44.470 --> 00:42:48.280
they have to stop the
search for Pue'o's body,

00:42:48.280 --> 00:42:50.660
Henry remembers
those days acutely,

00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:56.050
even when he struggles to recall
most recently passed hours.

00:42:56.050 --> 00:42:59.320
He worries that Kolea will
step on an old mango pit

00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.680
and cut her foot.

00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:03.450
And he worries she will
slice her hand with a knife.

00:43:03.450 --> 00:43:05.820
He worries when she
drives to see friends

00:43:05.820 --> 00:43:08.470
after a beer with him
that she'll go too fast

00:43:08.470 --> 00:43:10.890
and miss one of the curves.

00:43:10.890 --> 00:43:14.115
He worries she'll meet the wrong
kind of man, one who is cruel,

00:43:14.115 --> 00:43:17.010
or an addict, or a Playboy.

00:43:17.010 --> 00:43:20.100
Or that she'll meet the right
kind of man and then what will

00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:20.600
he say?

00:43:24.990 --> 00:43:28.010
He worries she will say she
made other plans for dinner,

00:43:28.010 --> 00:43:30.260
and he worries that
she'll stay but declined

00:43:30.260 --> 00:43:32.550
to watch the Raiders game.

00:43:32.550 --> 00:43:36.390
Together, these big and
small fears weigh on him,

00:43:36.390 --> 00:43:39.800
and he tamps down the worries
by calling out to her again,

00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:45.110
'Hey, time for [? pao." ?]
He waits for her to respond.

00:43:45.110 --> 00:43:47.890
Is he always waiting
to hear her voice?

00:43:47.890 --> 00:43:50.620
Is that what makes him a
father, that he is always

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.470
waiting for his children
to come back to him?

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:57.550
Her reply is lost in
the heat of the earth.

00:43:57.550 --> 00:43:59.050
Lost to the mountain above them.

00:43:59.050 --> 00:44:00.920
Lost in the water between them.

00:44:00.920 --> 00:44:05.570
And this is his greatest
fear, that he will lose her.

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:09.300
Then she's outside of the lo'i,
rinsing her arms and legs,

00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:12.360
her hands rubbing against each
other to wipe away the earth.

00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:18.240
She's beside him, reaching
for a mango slice."

00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:23.910
And finally, in this very brief
section that ends this chapter,

00:44:23.910 --> 00:44:27.970
Henry spends some time
recalling the maps he studied

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:30.360
after his son's disappearance.

00:44:30.360 --> 00:44:32.890
And he became so
adept at reading them

00:44:32.890 --> 00:44:35.050
that his friends,
who are at this point

00:44:35.050 --> 00:44:38.430
about to launch the lawsuit,
ask that he kind of become

00:44:38.430 --> 00:44:43.220
the expert on watersheds
and the EMI system.

00:44:43.220 --> 00:44:48.930
And so he kind of begins to see
himself as this expert of maps.

00:44:48.930 --> 00:44:51.720
So this closing
meditation from Henry

00:44:51.720 --> 00:44:53.840
is where I'll end my mo'olelo.

00:44:53.840 --> 00:44:56.840
And I hope it also
brings new meaning

00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:58.970
to the first story I told you.

00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:03.470
"The maps.

00:45:03.470 --> 00:45:05.390
That was how it all started.

00:45:05.390 --> 00:45:08.340
In the years that followed,
as he and his friends

00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.530
gathered their research, when
they were finally assigned

00:45:11.530 --> 00:45:15.360
a lawyer, and filed the
lawsuit against the plantation;

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:18.110
as they fought for
return of the water

00:45:18.110 --> 00:45:21.550
that had been taken from
them 100 years prior;

00:45:21.550 --> 00:45:24.590
as their kids left
adolescence for adulthood,

00:45:24.590 --> 00:45:27.640
and then left their homes
to make homes of their own;

00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:30.840
as their belly grew and their
hairlines shrunk, and those

00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:34.970
muscled shoulders became
smaller, or even-hunched;

00:45:34.970 --> 00:45:37.860
as they cut down to part
time or, in Henry's case,

00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:41.120
retired completely; as they
passed their businesses

00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.760
onto their children,
or, for Jean,

00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:46.390
as they struggled to make their
children understand that what

00:45:46.390 --> 00:45:48.740
they did they did for them,

00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:51.780
they became the
faces of the lawsuit.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.010
Some newspapers lampooned them.

00:45:54.010 --> 00:45:56.240
Others celebrated their cause.

00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.972
They attended
community meetings.

00:45:57.972 --> 00:45:59.430
They watched the
water commissioner

00:45:59.430 --> 00:46:01.320
be replaced four times.

00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:03.780
They were accused of
being water terrorists.

00:46:03.780 --> 00:46:07.820
They were lauded as
cultural saviors.

00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:10.820
That night, in bed
beside Ellen, Henry

00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:15.760
dreamed in mapped landscapes,
his imagination unfurling

00:46:15.760 --> 00:46:20.780
on a grid, organized by
neatly delineated quadrants.

00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:25.320
And when he awoke, age lending
a dull resistance to sleep,

00:46:25.320 --> 00:46:30.570
then the contours of his wife's
body resembled watersheds.

00:46:30.570 --> 00:46:32.970
Even in their lovemaking,
he'd sometimes

00:46:32.970 --> 00:46:37.260
look down at her breasts, still
firm after all these years,

00:46:37.260 --> 00:46:39.990
but heavier than they
had been in her youth,

00:46:39.990 --> 00:46:42.490
and determine how
a drop of sweat

00:46:42.490 --> 00:46:45.240
might belong to one
valley or another,

00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:49.680
depending on the
angle of decline.

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.200
He lost himself in
those maps, just

00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.930
as his son had been
lost to him somewhere

00:46:54.930 --> 00:46:57.390
in the folds of this island.

00:46:57.390 --> 00:47:02.410
And Ellen, too, was soon seduced
by the ascents and descents,

00:47:02.410 --> 00:47:05.390
the swerving lines,
the possibility

00:47:05.390 --> 00:47:08.840
that one of these times,
when they unfurled the map,

00:47:08.840 --> 00:47:12.130
they would understand
where their son had gone."

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:13.980
Thank you.
