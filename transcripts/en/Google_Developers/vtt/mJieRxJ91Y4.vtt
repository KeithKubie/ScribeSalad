00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:06.790
Welcome back to Google
Developers Weekly

00:00:06.790 --> 00:00:11.280
for January 21, 2014, our first
weekly wrap-up for the year.

00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:13.150
I'm Louis Gray, and
this our highlight reel

00:00:13.150 --> 00:00:15.400
of what's happening in the
world of Google Developers,

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.060
on the set and off.

00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.020
Team Chrome started
2014 off with a bang,

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.770
launching a great new
course on mobile web

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:23.410
development with Udacity.

00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:26.100
Instructors Chris Wilson, Sean
Bennett, and Peter Lubbers

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.730
join Udacity CEO Sebastian
Thrun in a special GDL event,

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.660
kicking off the course
to help you transform

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.220
your traditional
desktop focus web

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.280
apps into fast, effective,
mobile experiences.

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:40.490
You can sign up at
udacity.com/course/cs256.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.780
In fact, the course
is so fast paced,

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.810
the first study group
has already taken place.

00:00:44.810 --> 00:00:45.700
Good news, though.

00:00:45.700 --> 00:00:48.530
We recorded it and you
can catch up on GDL.

00:00:48.530 --> 00:00:50.400
The instructors took
Q&amp;A and offered help

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.640
on the course material.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:54.610
The world has gone mobile, and
it's time your software did.

00:00:54.610 --> 00:00:56.970
Last March, Google introduced
Blink, a new rendering

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:58.740
engine for the Chromium project.

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:01.440
Paul Irish hosted Eric Seidel,
an engineer working on Blink,

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.974
to bring us up to date.

00:01:02.974 --> 00:01:04.599
Eric covered
architectural improvements

00:01:04.599 --> 00:01:06.690
Chrome is making to the
Blink code base, focus

00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:08.860
on performance, and
some audacious ideas.

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:11.430
If you love the web,
you'll love this update.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.910
And a lot has happened in
the world of Enterprise Maps.

00:01:13.910 --> 00:01:15.990
Dylan Thomas joined
us in the GDL studio

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.860
to tell us what's new,
including Google Maps Engine API

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:22.070
updates, image referencing,
and symbology improvements,

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:24.265
as well as an update
to the Places API auto

00:01:24.265 --> 00:01:28.740
complete, and a brand new
Enterprise Maps app on Android.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:30.375
The YouTube developers
team brought us

00:01:30.375 --> 00:01:32.400
a pair of videos in
the last week or so.

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:34.470
After all, when
you think about it,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.300
videos are pretty
much what they do.

00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:38.390
First, Paris startup
Stupeflix joined

00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:40.550
us to talk about
their platform, which

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:43.450
makes it easy for people and
developers to create videos.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:45.686
They recently launched
Replay, allowing users

00:01:45.686 --> 00:01:47.560
to bring their photos
and recordings together

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:50.400
as a single video from
their phone or tablet.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:52.837
Then, from New
York, Jeff Posnick

00:01:52.837 --> 00:01:54.420
followed up with a
helpful talk on how

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:56.740
you can migrate from the
YouTube data API version

00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.995
two to version three, walking
us through the process using

00:01:59.995 --> 00:02:02.260
the Google Developers console.

00:02:02.260 --> 00:02:05.920
And with the new year, Google
Developers Academy is back.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.930
Google Developers
expert Caesar Anton

00:02:07.930 --> 00:02:10.460
launched a five
part series on GDL,

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.200
focusing on Google
Drive for Mexico City.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.070
[SPEAKING SPANISH]

00:02:17.070 --> 00:02:19.160
And from Berlin,
Martin Gorner hosted

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:21.850
Jerome Mouton,
CTO of SnapEngage,

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:23.940
the company behind
live chat capabilities

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:25.350
for thousands of sites.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:28.120
Jerome and Martin talk about
how SnapEngage has leveraged App

00:02:28.120 --> 00:02:31.360
Engine, and how the companies
optimize cloud platform cost

00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.180
through massive growth.

00:02:33.180 --> 00:02:35.670
Nasir Khan invited
Brian Lee of Orbitz

00:02:35.670 --> 00:02:37.400
to demonstrate how
the company integrated

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:40.470
with Google Wallet and
the Instant Buy API,

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:42.410
taking us through a
live demo of the app

00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.220
and speeding up purchases.

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:47.460
And as usual, the Android
team has a small handful

00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:48.720
of DevBytes for us.

00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:51.070
Check out Daniel Pham's
weekly summary on the Android

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.630
Developers YouTube
channel, or at

00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:58.886
developers.google.com/live/android
 for the latest on mobile.

00:02:58.886 --> 00:03:00.760
And have you ever been
running a web app only

00:03:00.760 --> 00:03:03.140
to encounter a slow patch,
and you didn't know why?

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:05.040
Wouldn't you love to
have a profiler running

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.510
that can tell you
what's going on?

00:03:06.510 --> 00:03:07.560
Now you can.

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:11.120
The latest Chrome Canary
introduces a sampling profiler

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:12.760
that you can turn
on once and then

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.540
forget about it
until you need it.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.040
Profile all the things.

00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.860
And Google Compute
Engine already

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:21.930
provides a reliable way
to run Apache Hadoop.

00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:25.050
Now we've added the Google Cloud
Storage connector for Hadoop

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.190
to make it easier to use
Hadoop on Cloud platform.

00:03:28.190 --> 00:03:29.770
To find out if
this is for you, we

00:03:29.770 --> 00:03:32.290
have a nice Hadoop
tutorial you can try.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:36.320
Check it out at
developers.google.com/hadoop.

00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:38.730
And to make sure you never
miss a thing from the world

00:03:38.730 --> 00:03:42.410

to Google Developers on YouTube

00:03:42.410 --> 00:03:46.580
