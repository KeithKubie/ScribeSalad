gelled there's a lack of an ideology we

01:11:01.820 --> 01:11:01.830
gelled there's a lack of an ideology we

were guided by monsters principles the
 

01:11:03.690 --> 01:11:05.540
were guided by monsters principles the
majority of us were guided by marxist

01:11:05.540 --> 01:11:05.550
majority of us were guided by marxist
 

01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:08.900
majority of us were guided by marxist
ideology so we had an ideology to work

01:11:08.900 --> 01:11:08.910
ideology so we had an ideology to work
 

01:11:08.910 --> 01:11:11.240

with there are multiple ideologies now

01:11:11.240 --> 01:11:11.250
with there are multiple ideologies now
 

01:11:11.250 --> 01:11:15.050
with there are multiple ideologies now
and they were very confusing social

01:11:15.050 --> 01:11:15.060
and they were very confusing social
 

01:11:15.060 --> 01:11:16.580
and they were very confusing social
movements have been debunked in some

01:11:16.580 --> 01:11:16.590
movements have been debunked in some
 

01:11:16.590 --> 01:11:18.979
movements have been debunked in some
ways and in many ways they've been

01:11:18.979 --> 01:11:18.989
ways and in many ways they've been
 

01:11:18.989 --> 01:11:20.390
ways and in many ways they've been
disparaged like you didn't do anything

01:11:20.390 --> 01:11:20.400
disparaged like you didn't do anything
 

01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:21.979
disparaged like you didn't do anything
what did you do you didn't do anything

01:11:21.979 --> 01:11:21.989
what did you do you didn't do anything
 

01:11:21.989 --> 01:11:23.840
what did you do you didn't do anything
the reality is that the majority of

01:11:23.840 --> 01:11:23.850
the reality is that the majority of
 

01:11:23.850 --> 01:11:25.160
the reality is that the majority of
people in this room would be here if it

01:11:25.160 --> 01:11:25.170
people in this room would be here if it
 

01:11:25.170 --> 01:11:26.150
people in this room would be here if it
hadn't been for all over social

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:26.160
hadn't been for all over social
 

01:11:26.160 --> 01:11:30.110
hadn't been for all over social
movements so you know we have to think

01:11:30.110 --> 01:11:30.120
movements so you know we have to think
 

01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.460
movements so you know we have to think
about the fact that we're in a really

01:11:31.460 --> 01:11:31.470
about the fact that we're in a really
 

01:11:31.470 --> 01:11:33.860
about the fact that we're in a really
different time so you start small to

01:11:33.860 --> 01:11:33.870
different time so you start small to
 

01:11:33.870 --> 01:11:36.290
different time so you start small to
build big that's what you have to do you

01:11:36.290 --> 01:11:36.300
build big that's what you have to do you
 

01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:38.210
build big that's what you have to do you
have to start small you work with people

01:11:38.210 --> 01:11:38.220
have to start small you work with people
 

01:11:38.220 --> 01:11:40.610
have to start small you work with people
who have similar interests and then you

01:11:40.610 --> 01:11:40.620
who have similar interests and then you
 

01:11:40.620 --> 01:11:42.740
who have similar interests and then you
start to build from there and you create

01:11:42.740 --> 01:11:42.750
start to build from there and you create
 

01:11:42.750 --> 01:11:44.810
start to build from there and you create
these little pockets I want to say that

01:11:44.810 --> 01:11:44.820
these little pockets I want to say that
 

01:11:44.820 --> 01:11:46.070
these little pockets I want to say that
even though gentrification may be

01:11:46.070 --> 01:11:46.080
even though gentrification may be
 

01:11:46.080 --> 01:11:48.830
even though gentrification may be
happening never underestimate people's

01:11:48.830 --> 01:11:48.840
happening never underestimate people's
 

01:11:48.840 --> 01:11:52.040
happening never underestimate people's
resistance to the decimation of their

01:11:52.040 --> 01:11:52.050
resistance to the decimation of their
 

01:11:52.050 --> 01:11:53.660
resistance to the decimation of their
culture and I think we look to the

01:11:53.660 --> 01:11:53.670
culture and I think we look to the
 

01:11:53.670 --> 01:11:56.240
culture and I think we look to the
Native Americans for that survival

01:11:56.240 --> 01:11:56.250
Native Americans for that survival
 

01:11:56.250 --> 01:11:58.100
Native Americans for that survival
everything else is going to be gone but

01:11:58.100 --> 01:11:58.110
everything else is going to be gone but
 

01:11:58.110 --> 01:11:59.750
everything else is going to be gone but
we're going to survive and we're going

01:11:59.750 --> 01:11:59.760
we're going to survive and we're going
 

01:11:59.760 --> 01:12:01.160
we're going to survive and we're going
to hold on to it

01:12:01.160 --> 01:12:01.170
to hold on to it
 

01:12:01.170 --> 01:12:05.070
to hold on to it
so I think there are pockets of extreme

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:05.080
so I think there are pockets of extreme
 

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.760
so I think there are pockets of extreme
pockets and um washington heights of

01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:07.770
pockets and um washington heights of
 

01:12:07.770 --> 01:12:10.500
pockets and um washington heights of
dominican culture absolutely it's being

01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:10.510
dominican culture absolutely it's being
 

01:12:10.510 --> 01:12:12.419
dominican culture absolutely it's being
manifested every single day when people

01:12:12.419 --> 01:12:12.429
manifested every single day when people
 

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:13.800
manifested every single day when people
visit each other that's Dominican

01:12:13.800 --> 01:12:13.810
visit each other that's Dominican
 

01:12:13.810 --> 01:12:16.530
visit each other that's Dominican
culture happening right then in there so

01:12:16.530 --> 01:12:16.540
culture happening right then in there so
 

01:12:16.540 --> 01:12:18.660
culture happening right then in there so
I think we have to think about the ways

01:12:18.660 --> 01:12:18.670
I think we have to think about the ways
 

01:12:18.670 --> 01:12:21.720
I think we have to think about the ways
that we define culture and we define

01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:21.730
that we define culture and we define
 

01:12:21.730 --> 01:12:23.490
that we define culture and we define
resistance because resistance is

01:12:23.490 --> 01:12:23.500
resistance because resistance is
 

01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:26.100
resistance because resistance is
incredibly complicated and people have

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:26.110
incredibly complicated and people have
 

01:12:26.110 --> 01:12:30.060
incredibly complicated and people have
an infinite array of resources that they

01:12:30.060 --> 01:12:30.070
an infinite array of resources that they
 

01:12:30.070 --> 01:12:32.640
an infinite array of resources that they
utilize when they want to resist and it

01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:32.650
utilize when they want to resist and it
 

01:12:32.650 --> 01:12:34.830
utilize when they want to resist and it
can be passive-aggressive and it's not

01:12:34.830 --> 01:12:34.840
can be passive-aggressive and it's not
 

01:12:34.840 --> 01:12:37.350
can be passive-aggressive and it's not
usually confrontational but there's

01:12:37.350 --> 01:12:37.360
usually confrontational but there's
 

01:12:37.360 --> 01:12:39.090
usually confrontational but there's
resistance going on and we need to be

01:12:39.090 --> 01:12:39.100
resistance going on and we need to be
 

01:12:39.100 --> 01:12:40.379
resistance going on and we need to be
