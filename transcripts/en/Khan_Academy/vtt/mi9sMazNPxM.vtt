00:00:00.609 --> 00:00:02.950
- [Narrator] As we've talked
about in multiple videos,

00:00:02.950 --> 00:00:05.366
some of the earliest
civilizations we have found

00:00:05.366 --> 00:00:07.315
have been around river valleys,

00:00:07.315 --> 00:00:09.407
and that is no coincidence
because some of the first

00:00:09.407 --> 00:00:11.973
agriculture emerged around river valleys

00:00:11.973 --> 00:00:14.690
and the agriculture supported
higher population densities

00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:17.155
and more sedentary populations,

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:19.758
and allowed for more specialization.

00:00:19.758 --> 00:00:21.770
And we have talked about several of these,

00:00:21.770 --> 00:00:25.437
the ancient Egyptians
around the Nile River,

00:00:26.536 --> 00:00:30.004
the ancient Mesopotamians
around the Tigris and Euphrates.

00:00:30.004 --> 00:00:33.889
And now we're gonna talk
about the ancient civilization

00:00:33.889 --> 00:00:35.762
around the Indus River.

00:00:35.762 --> 00:00:39.115
The Indus River runs mostly
in modern-day Pakistan,

00:00:39.115 --> 00:00:43.160
and that's why it's called
the Indus Valley civilization.

00:00:43.160 --> 00:00:45.327
Indus Valley Civilization.

00:00:48.883 --> 00:00:50.657
It's also sometimes referred to

00:00:50.657 --> 00:00:52.324
as the Harappan civilization,

00:00:52.324 --> 00:00:54.893
which was the first site
where they found evidence

00:00:54.893 --> 00:00:58.807
of this fairly extensive civilization.

00:00:58.807 --> 00:01:02.825
Now to get ourselves acquainted in time,

00:01:02.825 --> 00:01:06.325
this shows when archaeologists, historians

00:01:07.266 --> 00:01:11.433
consider to be the main part
of the Harappan civilization.

00:01:12.508 --> 00:01:15.747
There's evidence that
people had basic villages,

00:01:15.747 --> 00:01:17.672
civilizations, agriculture here,

00:01:17.672 --> 00:01:19.755
as far back as 7,000 BCE,

00:01:21.294 --> 00:01:23.657
and that's just based on
the evidence we have today,

00:01:23.657 --> 00:01:26.245
but when people refer to the
Indus Valley civilization

00:01:26.245 --> 00:01:30.632
in particular, they're usually
staring around 3300 BCE

00:01:30.632 --> 00:01:33.844
and in orange right over here,
this is the early period,

00:01:33.844 --> 00:01:37.802
or you could say the early
Indus Valley civilization.

00:01:37.802 --> 00:01:41.106
Now some of the biggest
structures and pieces

00:01:41.106 --> 00:01:43.276
of technology that have been discovered

00:01:43.276 --> 00:01:45.211
have been right over here,
which is often referred to

00:01:45.211 --> 00:01:49.378
as the mature period for the
Indus Valley civilization,

00:01:50.312 --> 00:01:51.837
and then it goes into decline.

00:01:51.837 --> 00:01:53.779
We'll talk about why it
might have gone into decline,

00:01:53.779 --> 00:01:55.509
although we're not really sure,

00:01:55.509 --> 00:01:57.974
and this is called the late.

00:01:57.974 --> 00:02:00.063
Now to put it in context
relative to these other

00:02:00.063 --> 00:02:03.485
civilizations, remember
the ancient Sumerians were

00:02:03.485 --> 00:02:06.811
starting to be quite, I guess
you could say civilized,

00:02:06.811 --> 00:02:08.706
by about this period.

00:02:08.706 --> 00:02:10.773
You start having a lot of intermingling

00:02:10.773 --> 00:02:13.232
between the Acadians and the Sumerians

00:02:13.232 --> 00:02:16.650
as you get into the late third millennium.

00:02:16.650 --> 00:02:19.978
That's when you have the
empire of Sargon the Great,

00:02:19.978 --> 00:02:21.412
the Acadian Empire.

00:02:21.412 --> 00:02:23.622
As you get to the end
of this mature period

00:02:23.622 --> 00:02:26.301
right over here, this is
close to or around the time

00:02:26.301 --> 00:02:28.998
of Hammurabi, the Babylonian Empire,

00:02:28.998 --> 00:02:32.985
and in Egypt, if you
go back to around 2500,

00:02:32.985 --> 00:02:35.525
around this time, that's
when the pyramids were built

00:02:35.525 --> 00:02:37.694
and you have the Egyptian Kings,

00:02:37.694 --> 00:02:41.774
these god-kings that were
ruling for most of this period

00:02:41.774 --> 00:02:44.685
right over here and as we'll
see, there was actually,

00:02:44.685 --> 00:02:47.020
we believe, a good bit
of cultural interchange

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.963
between the significant civilizations.

00:02:49.963 --> 00:02:53.461
Now just to appreciate how
extensive this Indus Valley

00:02:53.461 --> 00:02:57.044
civilization was, I
will show you this map.

00:02:58.334 --> 00:03:00.955
And this map, it's
zoomed in of that region

00:03:00.955 --> 00:03:03.267
around the Indus Valley
that I just showed you.

00:03:03.267 --> 00:03:05.541
This is a map of most of Pakistan here,

00:03:05.541 --> 00:03:08.778
and these red squares are
places where they have found

00:03:08.778 --> 00:03:10.574
evidence of the civilization.

00:03:10.574 --> 00:03:14.708
The first place was
Harappa, right over here,

00:03:14.708 --> 00:03:17.289
the Punjab region of Pakistan.

00:03:17.289 --> 00:03:20.183
And that's why it's called
the Harappan civilization.

00:03:20.183 --> 00:03:25.091
But as you can see, it's much
more than just around Harappa.

00:03:25.091 --> 00:03:28.364
The largest site is at Mohenjo-Daro,

00:03:28.364 --> 00:03:31.052
right over here in the
Sindh region of Pakistan

00:03:31.052 --> 00:03:33.629
and it's believed that
as many as 40,000 people

00:03:33.629 --> 00:03:36.256
lived in that city that
we now, or that site,

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:39.415
that we now call Mohenjo-Daro.

00:03:39.415 --> 00:03:43.171
And so far, we have discovered
over 1,000 sites in this area

00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:46.869
and we believe that as
many as five million people

00:03:46.869 --> 00:03:49.622
might have been part of the civilization.

00:03:49.622 --> 00:03:52.657
Now the reason why we
think it is a civilization

00:03:52.657 --> 00:03:55.127
and now, and let me actually
keep scrolling around

00:03:55.127 --> 00:03:56.922
so you appreciate the extent of it.

00:03:56.922 --> 00:04:00.285
There's sites in mainly, many
in Pakistan that you see here.

00:04:00.285 --> 00:04:03.952
There's also quite a
few in modern-day India

00:04:06.436 --> 00:04:08.804
right over here, so it's
an extensive network

00:04:08.804 --> 00:04:11.801
of these sites and the
reason why we think it's

00:04:11.801 --> 00:04:15.132
one civilization, or at
least a connected culture,

00:04:15.132 --> 00:04:17.659
is that you find a lot of standardization.

00:04:17.659 --> 00:04:20.843
You find standardization in
their weights and measures.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:22.717
In fact, they have a unit
of measurement that's

00:04:22.717 --> 00:04:25.889
as small as 1.6 millimeters,
and the reason why that's

00:04:25.889 --> 00:04:28.171
important is you wouldn't
create a unit of measurement

00:04:28.171 --> 00:04:31.694
of 1.6 millimeters unless you
knew how to use something,

00:04:31.694 --> 00:04:35.015
unless you know how to
make things that precise.

00:04:35.015 --> 00:04:37.566
And one of the things that
they made that precise

00:04:37.566 --> 00:04:39.427
are things like their structures.

00:04:39.427 --> 00:04:42.424
They had these standard
bricks and this brick size

00:04:42.424 --> 00:04:44.665
and many of these symbols that they used

00:04:44.665 --> 00:04:47.258
were found throughout these sites.

00:04:47.258 --> 00:04:49.564
Which said we don't know
whether they were controlled

00:04:49.564 --> 00:04:52.291
by one ruler or one emperor,
but there was definitely

00:04:52.291 --> 00:04:55.218
a lot of cultural interchange

00:04:55.218 --> 00:04:57.394
to the point that they were
using the same size bricks,

00:04:57.394 --> 00:04:59.116
they were using the same symbols,

00:04:59.116 --> 00:05:01.916
they were using the same
units of measurement.

00:05:01.916 --> 00:05:03.549
And also, as you can imagine,

00:05:03.549 --> 00:05:05.974
having a unit of measurement that precise,

00:05:05.974 --> 00:05:09.959
that small implies that
they were great builders.

00:05:09.959 --> 00:05:13.331
And the evidence we find
today says yes, they were.

00:05:13.331 --> 00:05:16.221
This is a picture of
the site at Mohenjo-Daro

00:05:16.221 --> 00:05:18.331
in modern-day Sindh Pakistan,

00:05:18.331 --> 00:05:20.986
and you can see how
tight this brick work is,

00:05:20.986 --> 00:05:23.901
even by modern standards
this is quite good.

00:05:23.901 --> 00:05:26.198
You'd need to think of how
many things we would build

00:05:26.198 --> 00:05:29.125
would last 5,000 years in this good,

00:05:29.125 --> 00:05:31.647
being exposed to the environments.

00:05:31.647 --> 00:05:33.134
They think this was a public bath.

00:05:33.134 --> 00:05:34.959
You see a citadel in the background.

00:05:34.959 --> 00:05:36.805
We've discovered defensive structures.

00:05:36.805 --> 00:05:39.339
Perhaps most impressively, there is,

00:05:39.339 --> 00:05:43.218
or most impressive,
there's sewage systems.

00:05:43.218 --> 00:05:45.455
They think houses had wells, water.

00:05:45.455 --> 00:05:48.154
So this was a technologically
advanced civilization

00:05:48.154 --> 00:05:49.573
especially for that time.

00:05:49.573 --> 00:05:52.423
In many ways, more advanced
than the other civilizations,

00:05:52.423 --> 00:05:55.095
the contemporary civilizations
that we had talked about.

00:05:55.095 --> 00:05:59.576
Here are some examples of their
sculpture or of their art.

00:05:59.576 --> 00:06:02.719
This is, this one right
over here is a picture,

00:06:02.719 --> 00:06:05.475
it's called Dancing Girl,
but she's not dancing,

00:06:05.475 --> 00:06:07.187
but they think that
might be her profession.

00:06:07.187 --> 00:06:09.711
It's all speculation by
archaeologists today.

00:06:09.711 --> 00:06:13.087
This they believe is called Priest-King,

00:06:13.087 --> 00:06:15.040
once again, it's all speculation.

00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:18.432
This is an example of the
types of seals they made.

00:06:18.432 --> 00:06:19.806
This is their jewelry, once again,

00:06:19.806 --> 00:06:21.710
this is quite intricate jewelry,

00:06:21.710 --> 00:06:24.235
and this jewelry was
not just discovered in

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:27.245
archaeological digs in
these various sites.

00:06:27.245 --> 00:06:30.828
There's evidence of
their jewelry as far as

00:06:33.131 --> 00:06:35.680
Mesopotamia in digs there.

00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:39.067
And they believe that there
was actually a very active

00:06:39.067 --> 00:06:42.496
maritime trade network
between these areas.

00:06:42.496 --> 00:06:45.304
There's jewelry discovered
in these Indus Valley

00:06:45.304 --> 00:06:47.571
civilizations that were based on shells

00:06:47.571 --> 00:06:50.461
from the Arabian peninsula.

00:06:50.461 --> 00:06:52.394
They have materials from China,

00:06:52.394 --> 00:06:54.415
so there's materials from
other parts of India,

00:06:54.415 --> 00:06:58.222
so once again, a very very
extensive trade network.

00:06:58.222 --> 00:07:02.725
These civilizations would
have known about them.

00:07:02.725 --> 00:07:05.453
But as we said, they were extremely,

00:07:05.453 --> 00:07:08.143
they seemed somewhat organized.

00:07:08.143 --> 00:07:10.678
Even though we can't read their writing,

00:07:10.678 --> 00:07:13.720
in fact I have some examples
of their writing here.

00:07:13.720 --> 00:07:16.026
And you might notice, so this is examples

00:07:16.026 --> 00:07:19.007
of their writing and
you might notice there,

00:07:19.007 --> 00:07:22.056
this is turned into a
somewhat infamous symbol now,

00:07:22.056 --> 00:07:24.515
because of the Nazis, this is a swastika.

00:07:24.515 --> 00:07:27.512
But the swastika was one
of the symbols they used,

00:07:27.512 --> 00:07:29.358
it's a symbol in Hinduism,

00:07:29.358 --> 00:07:32.301
it's considered a symbol of good luck.

00:07:32.301 --> 00:07:35.322
It's something that the
Nazis kind of usurped

00:07:35.322 --> 00:07:37.770
and turned it into a very negative thing,

00:07:37.770 --> 00:07:40.336
but it does show this connection between

00:07:40.336 --> 00:07:42.871
that Indus Valley or that
Harappan civilization

00:07:42.871 --> 00:07:45.570
and modern cultures that are in India and

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:47.377
things like the Hindu religion.

00:07:47.377 --> 00:07:49.064
Although once again, we do not know a ton

00:07:49.064 --> 00:07:52.439
about their religion because
their language hasn't

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:56.829
survived and we cannot
decipher their actual writing.

00:07:56.829 --> 00:08:00.390
But because of their
organization and the consistency,

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:02.983
or relative consistency
amongst these different sites

00:08:02.983 --> 00:08:04.106
that are so far flung,

00:08:04.106 --> 00:08:06.760
this is a large distance
even on modern day terms,

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.327
but especially if we're
talking about four or five

00:08:09.327 --> 00:08:10.994
thousand years ago.

00:08:10.994 --> 00:08:12.930
Because of that, we think that, okay,

00:08:12.930 --> 00:08:15.435
there must have been at
least decent government

00:08:15.435 --> 00:08:18.329
administration or organization
at a city-state level,

00:08:18.329 --> 00:08:20.520
although we're unsure
whether there was a connected

00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:23.220
empire, whether you had an
organization beyond that

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.021
or they all just decided to
take each other's standards

00:08:26.021 --> 00:08:30.104
and symbols and brick
sizes and things like that.

00:08:31.447 --> 00:08:35.530
Now, one of the key
mysteries of the Indus Valley

00:08:36.887 --> 00:08:39.384
civilization is why did it end?

00:08:39.384 --> 00:08:43.217
It seemed to be this
thriving civilization,

00:08:43.217 --> 00:08:45.705
perhaps the most extensive one.

00:08:45.705 --> 00:08:48.007
In other videos, I talk about right now,

00:08:48.007 --> 00:08:50.145
the oldest wheel was
discovered in Mesopotamia,

00:08:50.145 --> 00:08:52.152
but some people think that
the wheel might have been

00:08:52.152 --> 00:08:55.448
used even earlier in the
Indus Valley civilization.

00:08:55.448 --> 00:08:58.967
I talk about this period,
as early as 3300 BCE,

00:08:58.967 --> 00:09:02.789
but there's evidence that the civilization

00:09:02.789 --> 00:09:04.423
started much earlier.

00:09:04.423 --> 00:09:07.404
In the site right over here in Mehrgarh,

00:09:07.404 --> 00:09:09.300
right over here in Pakistan.

00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:12.265
They think that humans
were having simple villages

00:09:12.265 --> 00:09:14.022
and agriculture as early, there's evidence

00:09:14.022 --> 00:09:15.884
as early as 7000 BCE

00:09:15.884 --> 00:09:18.555
and that site was discovered just in 1974.

00:09:18.555 --> 00:09:20.495
We might discover things that take us

00:09:20.495 --> 00:09:22.061
even further into the past,

00:09:22.061 --> 00:09:24.812
and when you have a
civilization that was around for

00:09:24.812 --> 00:09:27.463
so long, if there were people
there as early as 7000 BCE,

00:09:27.463 --> 00:09:30.282
we're talking about it was
there for thousands of years,

00:09:30.282 --> 00:09:32.402
but all of a sudden, it starts to decline.

00:09:32.402 --> 00:09:35.292
There's evidence of less
and less trade going on,

00:09:35.292 --> 00:09:38.232
less and less sophistication,
and then it ends.

00:09:38.232 --> 00:09:40.474
And it's one of the mysteries of history,

00:09:40.474 --> 00:09:42.106
of archaeology today.

00:09:42.106 --> 00:09:45.143
Why did this Indus
Valley civilization end?

00:09:45.143 --> 00:09:47.264
Some of the older
theories were it was maybe

00:09:47.264 --> 00:09:50.044
it was a foreign invasion,
maybe some of the ancestors

00:09:50.044 --> 00:09:52.175
of the modern Indians invaded,

00:09:52.175 --> 00:09:54.347
or maybe they assimilated it somehow.

00:09:54.347 --> 00:09:57.587
More current theories don't
think that was the case.

00:09:57.587 --> 00:09:59.716
They think it might be some
form of climate change,

00:09:59.716 --> 00:10:01.934
that some of the
important rivers dried up,

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.727
made the agriculture much harder.

00:10:03.727 --> 00:10:05.791
Some people think it might
have been a natural disaster,

00:10:05.791 --> 00:10:07.669
it might have been a flood of some kind.

00:10:07.669 --> 00:10:09.006
But we just don't know.

00:10:09.006 --> 00:10:10.815
Or the people, for some
reason, decided to leave,

00:10:10.815 --> 00:10:14.323
die, migrate to maybe
other parts of the region.

00:10:14.323 --> 00:10:17.726
But needless to say, it was
a significant civilization,

00:10:17.726 --> 00:10:19.668
and we're just scratching the surface

00:10:19.668 --> 00:10:21.653
of what we know about it.

00:10:21.653 --> 00:10:23.572
We know a lot and we
know it was impressive,

00:10:23.572 --> 00:10:25.515
even though we can't read their script

00:10:25.515 --> 00:10:27.687
and we don't know as
much about it as we know

00:10:27.687 --> 00:10:30.306
about ancient Mesopotamia
and the ancient Egyptians,

00:10:30.306 --> 00:10:32.991
but signs are that as more time passes,

00:10:32.991 --> 00:10:36.688
we'll realize that it was
more and more sophisticated

00:10:36.688 --> 00:10:40.855
and impressive than maybe
we even appreciate today.
