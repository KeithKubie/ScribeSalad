00:00:00.348 --> 00:00:01.335
- [Instructor] The central figure

00:00:01.335 --> 00:00:04.136
in Christianity is, clearly, Jesus,

00:00:04.136 --> 00:00:05.837
but it's important to note that

00:00:05.837 --> 00:00:09.335
he does not establish the
religion all by himself.

00:00:09.335 --> 00:00:12.448
In fact, at the time if his crucifixion,

00:00:12.448 --> 00:00:14.487
and, according to Christian beliefs,

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:16.406
resurrection and ascension,

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:20.573
the number of followers he has
numbers in the low hundreds.

00:00:21.687 --> 00:00:25.498
The actual work of spreading and creating

00:00:25.498 --> 00:00:28.571
the church falls on his disciples,

00:00:28.571 --> 00:00:33.157
and, particular, the ones that
are referred to as apostles.

00:00:33.157 --> 00:00:35.395
When we looked at the Gospels,

00:00:35.395 --> 00:00:37.768
which are the life and
teachings of Jesus Christ,

00:00:37.768 --> 00:00:39.608
the first four books of the New Testament,

00:00:39.608 --> 00:00:41.320
Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John,

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:44.230
we talk about the 12 disciples,

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.979
those primary followers of Jesus.

00:00:46.979 --> 00:00:50.880
They're often referred to
as the 12 Apostles, as well,

00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:53.214
because according to Christian beliefs,

00:00:53.214 --> 00:00:57.193
between the resurrection
and the ascension of Jesus,

00:00:57.193 --> 00:01:00.294
he tells the apostles,
look, go spread the word.

00:01:00.294 --> 00:01:03.742
Apostle comes from Greek for
the one who spreads the word.

00:01:03.742 --> 00:01:06.715
These were the first
Christian missionaries.

00:01:06.715 --> 00:01:11.332
Now, first amongst these apostles
is often considered Peter.

00:01:11.332 --> 00:01:13.919
This is Peter, right over here.

00:01:13.919 --> 00:01:15.668
He is mentioned in the Gospels.

00:01:15.668 --> 00:01:19.807
He is beside Jesus at the
time of the Transfiguration.

00:01:19.807 --> 00:01:23.255
Amongst Roman Catholics, he
is viewed as the first Pope,

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:25.057
and he is really the head of

00:01:25.057 --> 00:01:27.568
the church of the Christian followers,

00:01:27.568 --> 00:01:29.590
and they're not even called
Christians at this point,

00:01:29.590 --> 00:01:32.090
in Jerusalem, right over here.

00:01:33.717 --> 00:01:35.067
But we're gonna talk about another

00:01:35.067 --> 00:01:37.493
significant apostle, as well,

00:01:37.493 --> 00:01:40.160
in this video, and that is Paul.

00:01:41.043 --> 00:01:43.713
As we'll see, Paul is not mentioned in

00:01:43.713 --> 00:01:45.705
the first four books of the Bible,

00:01:45.705 --> 00:01:48.593
he wasn't a contemporary of Jesus,

00:01:48.593 --> 00:01:52.318
or, at least, he didn't
know Jesus during his life.

00:01:52.318 --> 00:01:54.101
He did live at the same time,

00:01:54.101 --> 00:01:55.780
and you can see it on this timeline

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:59.947
where Jesus is born slightly
before the Common Era,

00:02:01.266 --> 00:02:03.718
I start at year one, because
there isn't a year zero,

00:02:03.718 --> 00:02:05.554
and you can see that Peter is born,

00:02:05.554 --> 00:02:07.689
historians believe, around 1 AD,

00:02:07.689 --> 00:02:10.568
and Paul would have been
born shortly after that.

00:02:10.568 --> 00:02:12.357
What's interesting about Paul is,

00:02:12.357 --> 00:02:17.066
Paul starts his life as a
very conservative Pharisee.

00:02:17.066 --> 00:02:21.155
He starts his life
persecuting Christian people,

00:02:21.155 --> 00:02:24.457
and then he has a fairly dramatic switch.

00:02:24.457 --> 00:02:26.374
You'll often hear Paul,

00:02:27.729 --> 00:02:32.018
or you might also hear the
name Saul, or Paul of Tarsus,

00:02:32.018 --> 00:02:34.441
these are all referring
to the same person.

00:02:34.441 --> 00:02:38.254
Tarsus is right over here, in
modern day Southern Turkey.

00:02:38.254 --> 00:02:40.119
Paul, as I mentioned, he grows up

00:02:40.119 --> 00:02:41.857
in a conservative Jewish family,

00:02:41.857 --> 00:02:43.918
but he also has Roman citizenship.

00:02:43.918 --> 00:02:45.932
That's why he has this Roman name, Paul,

00:02:45.932 --> 00:02:47.767
and he has his Hebrew name, Saul.

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:50.082
He's educated in Jerusalem.

00:02:50.082 --> 00:02:53.354
He doesn't enter into
the story until we get

00:02:53.354 --> 00:02:55.455
to the fifth book of the New Testament,

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.781
the Acts of the Apostles.

00:02:57.781 --> 00:03:00.056
The Acts of the Apostles
talks a lot about Peter,

00:03:00.056 --> 00:03:02.995
how he spreads the church,
how he is persecuted,

00:03:02.995 --> 00:03:05.745
how he performs various miracles,

00:03:07.327 --> 00:03:11.204
but it also is where we
get introduced to Paul.

00:03:11.204 --> 00:03:12.753
When we first see him, as I mentioned,

00:03:12.753 --> 00:03:14.891
he is persecuting Christians.

00:03:14.891 --> 00:03:19.629
As this Church of Jerusalem
starts to get established,

00:03:19.629 --> 00:03:23.129
Peter puts a fellow by the name of Stephen

00:03:24.180 --> 00:03:27.557
in charge of distributing alms to widows

00:03:27.557 --> 00:03:29.857
that are coming to them.

00:03:29.857 --> 00:03:31.642
Stephen, and this is a narrative

00:03:31.642 --> 00:03:33.594
that you'll hear often
in the New Testament,

00:03:33.594 --> 00:03:36.243
he starts to get on the nerves

00:03:36.243 --> 00:03:38.282
of the religious establishment,

00:03:38.282 --> 00:03:39.820
the Jewish religious establishment,

00:03:39.820 --> 00:03:42.044
who think that he's a blasphemer,

00:03:42.044 --> 00:03:43.691
that his beliefs are threatening them,

00:03:43.691 --> 00:03:46.557
and so there's this
famous trial, once again,

00:03:46.557 --> 00:03:49.881
with the Sanhedrin, and
the trial of Stephen.

00:03:49.881 --> 00:03:53.567
Here I have an account
for him, of that trial,

00:03:53.567 --> 00:03:58.278
or near the end of that
trial, from the book of Acts,

00:03:58.278 --> 00:04:01.291
and during that trial Stephen goes into

00:04:01.291 --> 00:04:04.139
this long account of what
the teachings of Jesus are,

00:04:04.139 --> 00:04:05.917
and how they're justified by

00:04:05.917 --> 00:04:08.001
what is mentioned in the Old Testament.

00:04:08.001 --> 00:04:11.203
He actually does a fairly
long account of it.

00:04:11.203 --> 00:04:13.703
He also is fairly rebellious.

00:04:13.703 --> 00:04:16.602
He says, look, you, the establishment,

00:04:16.602 --> 00:04:20.952
what prophet have you
not persecuted before?

00:04:20.952 --> 00:04:22.766
This really angers them, and so

00:04:22.766 --> 00:04:24.203
we read from the book of Acts,

00:04:24.203 --> 00:04:26.829
they all rushed at him,
dragged him out of the city,

00:04:26.829 --> 00:04:28.778
and began to stone him.

00:04:28.778 --> 00:04:30.577
Meanwhile, the witnesses lay their coats

00:04:30.577 --> 00:04:33.863
at the feet of a young man named Saul,

00:04:33.863 --> 00:04:38.253
and we see him right over here,
depicted in this painting.

00:04:38.253 --> 00:04:41.338
Saul approved of their killing him.

00:04:41.338 --> 00:04:43.983
On that day, a great persecution

00:04:43.983 --> 00:04:47.045
broke out against the church in Jerusalem.

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:49.171
All except the apostles were scattered

00:04:49.171 --> 00:04:51.930
throughout Judea and Samaria.

00:04:51.930 --> 00:04:55.596
Godly men buried Stephen
and mourned deeply for him.

00:04:55.596 --> 00:04:58.346
But Saul began to destroy the church.

00:04:58.346 --> 00:05:00.355
Going from house to house,

00:05:00.355 --> 00:05:04.706
he dragged off both men and
women and put them in prison.

00:05:04.706 --> 00:05:08.548
He is a pretty fervent
persecutor of Christians.

00:05:08.548 --> 00:05:10.298
It goes even further.

00:05:11.861 --> 00:05:15.381
Then, we read, we go on to
read in the book of Acts,

00:05:15.381 --> 00:05:18.218
Meanwhile, Saul was still breathing out

00:05:18.218 --> 00:05:20.880
murderous threats against
the Lord's disciples.

00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:23.409
He went to the high priest and asked him

00:05:23.409 --> 00:05:26.184
for letters to the synagogues in Damascus,

00:05:26.184 --> 00:05:29.756
so that if he found any there
who belonged to the Way,

00:05:29.756 --> 00:05:31.757
whether men or women, he might take them

00:05:31.757 --> 00:05:33.234
as prisoners to Jerusalem.

00:05:33.234 --> 00:05:35.632
As he neared Damascus on his journey,

00:05:35.632 --> 00:05:36.909
so this is going to be interesting thing.

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.133
He's so fervent, he
goes to the high priest,

00:05:39.133 --> 00:05:41.785
and says, I wanna persecute

00:05:41.785 --> 00:05:43.610
these Christians wherever they are.

00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:45.006
I wanna go to Damascus,

00:05:45.006 --> 00:05:46.647
and see if I can persecute them there.

00:05:46.647 --> 00:05:48.607
As he neared Damascus on his journey,

00:05:48.607 --> 00:05:51.882
suddenly a light from
heaven flashed around him.

00:05:51.882 --> 00:05:55.157
He fell to the ground and
heard a voice say to him,

00:05:55.157 --> 00:05:58.660
"Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?"

00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:03.583
This is an image of that,
this narrative in the Bible.

00:06:03.583 --> 00:06:05.419
"Who are you, Lord?", Saul asked.

00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:09.247
"I am Jesus, whom you are
persecuting," he replied.

00:06:09.247 --> 00:06:11.333
"Now get up and go into the city,"

00:06:11.333 --> 00:06:12.421
the city being Damascus,

00:06:12.421 --> 00:06:14.920
"and you will be told what you must do."

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:17.420
Paul is blinded by this event.

00:06:18.270 --> 00:06:19.598
He's blind for three days.

00:06:19.598 --> 00:06:20.534
He goes to Damascus,

00:06:20.534 --> 00:06:23.951
and he is healed by a follower of Christ.

00:06:25.797 --> 00:06:28.820
At that moment, he completely does a 180.

00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:29.807
He goes from being one of

00:06:29.807 --> 00:06:31.581
the chief persecutors of the Christians,

00:06:31.581 --> 00:06:34.306
to being one of the chief believers,

00:06:34.306 --> 00:06:38.594
and he starts to aggressively
spread the faith.

00:06:38.594 --> 00:06:42.177
So that brings us, so
let's go to this map,

00:06:43.183 --> 00:06:46.516
because what's significant about Paul is

00:06:47.378 --> 00:06:49.446
Peter was, you can really view him

00:06:49.446 --> 00:06:53.584
as the first head of the
church, especially after Jesus,

00:06:53.584 --> 00:06:56.481
but he primarily viewed it as something

00:06:56.481 --> 00:06:58.354
to spread amongst the Jewish people.

00:06:58.354 --> 00:06:59.569
There are events, for example,

00:06:59.569 --> 00:07:00.755
in Acts where he does realize,

00:07:00.755 --> 00:07:02.729
hey, maybe I should be,

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.791
the word of Jesus should go
beyond the Jewish people.

00:07:05.791 --> 00:07:07.075
It should go to the non-Jews,

00:07:07.075 --> 00:07:09.317
who are referred to as Gentiles.

00:07:09.317 --> 00:07:11.505
But Paul, and you can see on the map here,

00:07:11.505 --> 00:07:14.525
he has this revelation,
I guess you could say,

00:07:14.525 --> 00:07:16.980
as he's approaching Damascus.

00:07:16.980 --> 00:07:19.147
He goes back to Jerusalem,

00:07:20.267 --> 00:07:24.017
and he tries to convince
the other followers,

00:07:24.929 --> 00:07:26.355
and you can imagine
they're quite skeptical

00:07:26.355 --> 00:07:29.892
of this person who is shortly
before persecuting them.

00:07:29.892 --> 00:07:31.667
But he eventually convinces them,

00:07:31.667 --> 00:07:34.402
and he goes on multiple
missionary journeys,

00:07:34.402 --> 00:07:35.879
spreading the faith.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:38.767
His center of operations is at Antioch,

00:07:38.767 --> 00:07:39.902
and he's a significant figure

00:07:39.902 --> 00:07:42.451
who helps build the church at Antioch.

00:07:42.451 --> 00:07:44.863
What's interesting about
the Church of Antioch,

00:07:44.863 --> 00:07:47.062
it ends up being a very
significant church,

00:07:47.062 --> 00:07:51.229
is that at Antioch, the
Christians, or the Christian faith,

00:07:52.162 --> 00:07:54.277
is not just spread to the Jewish people,

00:07:54.277 --> 00:07:57.277
they're spread to the
non-Jews, to the Gentiles.

00:07:57.277 --> 00:07:59.124
It's actually at the Church of Antioch

00:07:59.124 --> 00:08:00.612
that the followers of Jesus Christ,

00:08:00.612 --> 00:08:02.447
according to Biblical accounts,

00:08:02.447 --> 00:08:06.101
were first referred to as Christians.

00:08:06.101 --> 00:08:09.122
What you see on this map, here,

00:08:09.122 --> 00:08:13.038
are the various missionary
journeys that Paul,

00:08:13.038 --> 00:08:15.186
who is a Roman citizen, was able,

00:08:15.186 --> 00:08:17.276
or Saul, depending on
which name you want to use,

00:08:17.276 --> 00:08:21.443
was able to do through, especially
the Eastern Roman Empire.

00:08:22.638 --> 00:08:25.055
In that mid 40s here, let me,

00:08:26.110 --> 00:08:28.686
in the mid 40s, right over here,

00:08:28.686 --> 00:08:31.610
he does a missionary journey.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:33.674
Once again, Antioch is his base,

00:08:33.674 --> 00:08:36.848
he goes to Cyprus, and southern, mid,

00:08:36.848 --> 00:08:39.711
what we would call Turkey today.

00:08:39.711 --> 00:08:43.561
In the early 50s, he goes
on this fairly long journey

00:08:43.561 --> 00:08:46.224
through modern day Turkey,

00:08:46.224 --> 00:08:49.638
through Macedonia, through Greece.

00:08:49.638 --> 00:08:53.524
As he's doing this, he's spreading
the word of Jesus Christ.

00:08:53.524 --> 00:08:55.451
He's starting to help establish churches

00:08:55.451 --> 00:08:57.199
in these significant places,

00:08:57.199 --> 00:08:59.438
Philippi, Thessalonica, Corinth,

00:08:59.438 --> 00:09:01.100
all of these various places.

00:09:01.100 --> 00:09:04.448
You see his third journey, here,

00:09:04.448 --> 00:09:08.615
very similar in path in
yellow to the second journey.

00:09:09.472 --> 00:09:12.198
He does that in the late 50s CE.

00:09:12.198 --> 00:09:16.389
Once again, he's constantly
establishing these churches.

00:09:16.389 --> 00:09:18.761
The important thing to realize about Paul,

00:09:18.761 --> 00:09:20.514
it's a controversy.

00:09:20.514 --> 00:09:23.561
To what degree should
the teachings of Jesus

00:09:23.561 --> 00:09:27.186
be spread to the Gentiles,
to the non-Jewish people?

00:09:27.186 --> 00:09:29.198
There are these famous debates,

00:09:29.198 --> 00:09:32.900
and Paul's view is, no, we
should not force the Gentiles

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:35.686
to do everything that the Jews have to do,

00:09:35.686 --> 00:09:39.699
the circumcision, the Jewish dietary laws.

00:09:39.699 --> 00:09:44.546
You could imagine, this doubly
angers the church leaders.

00:09:44.546 --> 00:09:48.287
Not only is he spreading
the word of Jesus,

00:09:48.287 --> 00:09:50.714
that has annoyed them to no end,

00:09:50.714 --> 00:09:53.326
but he also wants to
spread it to the Gentiles,

00:09:53.326 --> 00:09:55.064
but he doesn't think that the Gentiles

00:09:55.064 --> 00:09:56.853
need to perform all of the things

00:09:56.853 --> 00:09:59.516
that the Jewish leaders
believe are dictated

00:09:59.516 --> 00:10:03.016
by the laws of Moses, by the Jewish faith.

00:10:05.238 --> 00:10:06.989
And circumcision is
actually a major debate.

00:10:06.989 --> 00:10:10.466
Circumcision, the dietary
habits, et cetera, et cetera.

00:10:10.466 --> 00:10:11.928
Eventually, he goes back

00:10:11.928 --> 00:10:15.491
to Jerusalem to face this leadership,

00:10:15.491 --> 00:10:18.241
and now this is in the early 60s,

00:10:19.202 --> 00:10:23.335
and they, once again,
they put him on trial.

00:10:23.335 --> 00:10:25.276
As a Jewish citizen, he says, hey,

00:10:25.276 --> 00:10:26.926
I have a right to see the Emperor.

00:10:26.926 --> 00:10:29.589
He is taken to Rome, and along the way

00:10:29.589 --> 00:10:32.275
they get caught in a storm,

00:10:32.275 --> 00:10:34.752
but eventually he makes his way to Rome,

00:10:34.752 --> 00:10:37.038
where he is held prisoner.

00:10:37.038 --> 00:10:41.205
It is believed that both Peter
and Paul were killed by Nero.

00:10:42.637 --> 00:10:44.389
We talk in previous videos,

00:10:44.389 --> 00:10:47.238
the fire in 64 CE in Rome that

00:10:47.238 --> 00:10:48.902
destroys a large chunk of the city.

00:10:48.902 --> 00:10:51.500
Some people think Nero
actually set the fire

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:54.576
to clear some land so that
he could build his palace.

00:10:54.576 --> 00:10:57.751
He famously blames the fire on Christians.

00:10:57.751 --> 00:11:01.013
There's a large purge of
Christians that occur after that.

00:11:01.013 --> 00:11:04.013
A lot of accounts say that
Peter was crucified by Nero.

00:11:04.013 --> 00:11:06.012
He requests, according to these accounts,

00:11:06.012 --> 00:11:07.775
to be crucified upside down,

00:11:07.775 --> 00:11:09.023
because he doesn't deserve to get

00:11:09.023 --> 00:11:11.625
the same crucifixion as Jesus,

00:11:11.625 --> 00:11:14.825
and Paul, some accounts
say, that he was beheaded.

00:11:14.825 --> 00:11:16.323
Once again, they're dying in these

00:11:16.323 --> 00:11:20.198
Christian purges that Nero is performing.

00:11:20.198 --> 00:11:24.378
You can see it right over here,
if those accounts are true.

00:11:24.378 --> 00:11:25.526
Now it's really interesting,

00:11:25.526 --> 00:11:26.817
I already talked about Paul

00:11:26.817 --> 00:11:29.367
being this missionary to the Gentiles.

00:11:29.367 --> 00:11:31.493
He is the one, especially
at the Church of Antioch,

00:11:31.493 --> 00:11:35.541
where Christianity starts to
really separate from Judaism,

00:11:35.541 --> 00:11:37.929
starts to become a
faith in it's own right.

00:11:37.929 --> 00:11:39.417
That was even further accelerated

00:11:39.417 --> 00:11:41.865
in a few years after their death,

00:11:41.865 --> 00:11:44.380
or it might have been roughly
coincident with their death,

00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:45.802
depending on when their deaths were.

00:11:45.802 --> 00:11:49.552
From 66 to 70, you have
the Jewish rebellion,

00:11:52.616 --> 00:11:55.227
sometimes called the
First Roman-Jewish War,

00:11:55.227 --> 00:11:58.627
and it ends with the
Roman Empire destroying

00:11:58.627 --> 00:12:01.478
the temple at Jerusalem, the
center of the Jewish faith.

00:12:01.478 --> 00:12:02.967
The second temple of Jerusalem,

00:12:02.967 --> 00:12:07.404
the one that was rebuilt,
partially, by Cyrus the Great.

00:12:07.404 --> 00:12:10.517
So this causes the Jewish
people to have to leave,

00:12:10.517 --> 00:12:14.684
and they no longer have
this center of their people.

00:12:15.591 --> 00:12:17.541
You have the Jewish diaspora that

00:12:17.541 --> 00:12:19.217
gets spread throughout the Roman Empire,

00:12:19.217 --> 00:12:23.129
and other empires, like
the Parthians in Persia.

00:12:23.129 --> 00:12:26.931
They really, there's a famous
battle in 73 of Masada,

00:12:26.931 --> 00:12:29.914
this mountain fortress, where the Romans,

00:12:29.914 --> 00:12:31.978
essentially, well, it's a mass suicide,

00:12:31.978 --> 00:12:34.405
but it's this bloody extermination of

00:12:34.405 --> 00:12:37.866
the Jewish people in and around Jerusalem,

00:12:37.866 --> 00:12:39.143
so they are spread.

00:12:39.143 --> 00:12:41.204
That's, obviously, a significant series

00:12:41.204 --> 00:12:43.026
of events for the Jewish people,

00:12:43.026 --> 00:12:45.416
but it's also significant
for Christianity,

00:12:45.416 --> 00:12:49.043
because Jerusalem was a
center of the Christian faith.

00:12:49.043 --> 00:12:51.753
Now the Christian followers
are going to be spread around,

00:12:51.753 --> 00:12:55.212
and many of these other places
that Paul spread the Gospel,

00:12:55.212 --> 00:12:58.229
becomes centers of Christianity.

00:12:58.229 --> 00:13:01.844
Now to emphasize the importance
of Paul to Christianity,

00:13:01.844 --> 00:13:05.580
this is a listing of
the books of the Bible.

00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:07.002
Jesus, his life and teachings,

00:13:07.002 --> 00:13:10.182
is primarily coming from
the Gospels, right here.

00:13:10.182 --> 00:13:11.655
Most of what I told you in this video,

00:13:11.655 --> 00:13:15.105
this is excerpts from the fifth
book of the New Testament,

00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:17.229
Acts of the Apostles.

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:21.431
Then, most modern orderings of the Bible,

00:13:21.431 --> 00:13:23.381
the next several, or many books,

00:13:23.381 --> 00:13:24.815
are called epistles, or letters.

00:13:24.815 --> 00:13:27.259
They're primarily the epistles of Paul,

00:13:27.259 --> 00:13:29.672
letters that he wrote to his
followers in different places.

00:13:29.672 --> 00:13:31.382
You can see most of these names,

00:13:31.382 --> 00:13:35.034
these are cities that you see
where Paul was a missionary.

00:13:35.034 --> 00:13:36.957
Corinthians, Corinth is right here,

00:13:36.957 --> 00:13:39.384
these are letters that Paul is
sending to the church there.

00:13:39.384 --> 00:13:40.534
Galatians, you see Galatia

00:13:40.534 --> 00:13:42.947
right over here in
central modern day Turkey.

00:13:42.947 --> 00:13:44.997
Ephesians in Ephesus,

00:13:44.997 --> 00:13:47.860
Philippians in Philippi, right over here,

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:49.507
Colossians in Colossae,

00:13:49.507 --> 00:13:53.424
Thessalonians in
Thessalonica, right over here.

00:13:54.332 --> 00:13:56.447
This is a major chunk of the Bible

00:13:56.447 --> 00:13:58.933
that is either written by Paul,

00:13:58.933 --> 00:14:01.472
or some people think
it was written by Paul,

00:14:01.472 --> 00:14:03.558
or is ascribed to Paul.

00:14:03.558 --> 00:14:05.783
What I have here in this deeper orange,

00:14:05.783 --> 00:14:07.520
these are the books that historians

00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:09.922
think were actually written by Paul.

00:14:09.922 --> 00:14:12.059
This lighter orange,
there are some debate,

00:14:12.059 --> 00:14:13.547
and the yellow ones are the ones

00:14:13.547 --> 00:14:16.721
where people think it probably
wasn't written by Paul.

00:14:16.721 --> 00:14:17.632
As you can imagine, this is

00:14:17.632 --> 00:14:20.259
a significant chunk of the New Testament

00:14:20.259 --> 00:14:24.645
that was actually written
or ascribed to Paul.

00:14:24.645 --> 00:14:27.072
He was really the significant missionary

00:14:27.072 --> 00:14:31.239
that created the Christian
faith beyond the Jewish people.
