Speaker 1:          00:00:00       [inaudible]

Speaker 2:          00:00:05       alright. Ladles and jellies spoons. We are alive on www.youtube.com/rubin report. All right. And there's a lot to do here and we've only got an hour today because I've had a completely bananas day. I feel like my days are getting more and more. I like to say bonkers, but I've gone with bananas. I said Banana sometimes to, uh, my days are getting crazier and crazier these days. Um, I've already taped three shows today and I was up at the crack of dawn and I did a 45 minute a radio interview. I had about two minute breaks in between everything. And here we are. We're going live. The second I'm done here, there's already a car waiting for me outside. I'm heading over to, uh, to do Tucker Carlson tonight and then, excuse me. Then I hear that that a, that Trump fell has given a big speech. I guess I'll have to tweet that thing.

Speaker 2:          00:00:51       So it's going to be one of those days. It's all good. Uh, what I wanted to do is, as you guys know, I am departing Patrion Sam Harris has already left Patrion uh, Jordan Peterson will be joining me on January 15th. We will be deleting our patrion accounts. This is all because of their treatment of Carl Benjamin Sargon of a cod. I'm sure most of you are well aware of that whole situation, so I don't want to repeat the whole thing. Uh, suffice to say that every now and again in life I think you have to just take a stand when it's not easy to do so and maybe not popular to do so. And maybe puts yourself at some risk. And I just think this is the right one for us to take. A patrion has been amazing to us. We've been on there for about two and a half years.

Speaker 2:          00:01:30       You guys know all the stuff about youtube demonetization and how hard it is to, to make a living as a, as a youtube creator. A patron has been awesome for us. I built a business, I bought a house, I hired employees. Everything that we've done basically in the last two and a half years has been because of Patrion. Uh, but we are deleting it. It's time. It's time to stand up. Jordan and I are working on a platform that I think can be a solution to this. There are many layers of problems that we're going to have to deal with a, but we're thinking them all through about payments and crypto and the terms of service and the whole thing. You've heard me talk about all of that before. So what we're doing today, I'm only gonna do two more. One today and one on the 15th on January 15th.

Speaker 2:          00:02:12       Uh, two more live streams, uh, doing a little fundraising because we're getting everybody off Patrion and we're trying to get people over to Dave rubin.com/donate. That removes some of the middleman we can. We can control everything. It doesn't solve all of the technological or monetization problems yet, but get everybody to over to our website and, and off of Patrion and stand up to the man, so to speak. Uh, so we're doing a little fundraising. So here's the deal. Anyone that donates@daverubin.com slash donate for the next hour while I am live. Anyone who donates $5 or above, however you do it over there, I'm going to give you a live shout out. So I've got an iPad here and my guys will be typing out names. You will get alive. Shout out if you do $5 or above. If you do $25 or above, you're going to get the Rubin report tee shirt.

Speaker 2:          00:02:58       Now this select member tee shirt, this was the t shirt that we were given to our patrons who were at the high level that we're at the tee shirt level. So we've got about a hundred of these left. They will never be printed again because we're not on patrion anymore, so select no longer exists. So these are the last ones. They are a limited edition collector's item. Ladies and Gentlemen, I'm wearing one of them right now. Maybe I'll have to give away the one right on my back. We we shall see. So that's $25 or above monthly. And you're going to get a tee shirt. If you go to $50 or above, uh, during this live stream for the next hour, I'm going to take the official Ruben report mug and what am I going to do to it? I'm going to sign it. I'm going to show you how, I'm going to sign it right here.

Speaker 2:          00:03:39       I'm going to sign it for Ya. And you could get that mug. So whoever does the first 50 and dollars Mug, uh, the first $50 person monthly at a time's up, Dave Ruben. Dot. Constellation donate. You can get this mug that I just signed right now. There you go. Okay. Putting that down. So we've got tee shirts, we've got mugs and basically you guys are funding our ability to keep this thing totally independent. We have had, as I've said, we have had offers from networks. There's all sorts of advertisers that want to jump on board, all sorts of stuff. So none of this is Crimea river and I'm not sitting here woe is me or anything like there is plenty of opportunity. I love doing what we've done the way we've done it, remained independent. I am, I am beholden only to you guys. And there's a certain beauty in that because I genuinely have, I can't say, I have no idea.

Speaker 2:          00:04:22       I have almost no idea what most of you think about anything. So it's like I couldn't really sell out one way or another or any other way because I get emails, people that are conservatives, I get liberal emails. I get some angry emails from progressive's. I get a lot emails from Libertarians. I mean all of this, but I don't even know exactly what my, my, uh, patrons in the past and people who are currently supporting us things. So I can just do what I think is right, which is what I've tried to consistently do. And just what I'll consistently try to do. So, okay, if you go to Dave rubin.com/donate $5 and above, uh, I'm going to give you a shout out, 25 bucks and above monthly you're getting the Rubin report, tee shirt and $50 or above monthly. You're getting assigned mug right now.

Speaker 2:          00:04:59       And you're getting the t shirt and I'll just keep talking to you guys. Oh, by the way, tomorrow I will be at the Ontario Improv, not Ontario, Canada. I'm sorry to those of you in Canada. A lot of people were very confused last time. Uh, it's Ontario, California, which is, I think it's about an hour away. Uh, southern California. Um, I will be there tomorrow night doing standup. I do about an hour set and then I will be bringing Bret Weinstein, a professor in exile, Bret Weinstein, formerly of evergreen state. And you guys, I'm sure all know his story. He'll join me for a sit down afterwards and it's just like a fun night. It's not normal standup like you've ever seen before. I mess around with the crowd a lot. We got people screaming, I giveaway stuff. We do a live Q and a. It's like, it's like just a free for all.

Speaker 2:          00:05:44       I think you'll, I think you'll really dig it. Um, so check that out. And uh, Oh and on, uh, January, Twitter 30th, I will be at the Irvine Improv in Irvine, California, Orange County. And I will have an IDW guests with not saying who that is just yet. Okay. We've got a couple shout outs to Jared and Andy, welcome aboard. Thanks guys. And Garrett, you were the first one that I saw. So Garret is getting this mug. Let's make sure we put this mug aside. That was a person when I signed and Brad, welcome aboard. You also are getting a mug which I'm going to sign for you right now. Thank you guys. You are a supporting our ability to do what we're doing. So as I said, I'm only gonna do one more of these and then I won't, uh, you know, promoter, whenever you're going to call this fundraiser drive, whatever it is, I won't do it throughout the year.

Speaker 2:          00:06:29       I, you know, once a year I think we'll do it going forward like one day where we're like, all right, we're trying to raise some funds to do this or that. The next one that I'll do and then it'll, we'll be done for all of 2019 will be on January 15th. We're going to do one of these. I'll do a little giveaway and some fun stuff and all that. And then I'm going to take my computer. We have to figure out how this is exactly going to work. Logistically. I will turn it around and I'm going to press delete on Patrion right in front of you guys. So you will watch me delete patrion right then and there we will get rid of that thing. Um, it's no hard feelings, any of those guys in a weird way. It's like you want to run your business that way.

Speaker 2:          00:07:03       I'm not going to have the government jump in and tell you what to do, but I just don't want to be part of, of what they're doing anymore. So we're going to do that on January 15th, Jordan and I also should have some updates on things. Hopefully somewhat soon. Things are moving. Trust me, things are moving. Just takes a little time to get things done. All right, so, uh, let me jump into some questions. We're also take some questions on super chat. I see a whole bunch of you guys jumping in on that. So, uh, from Patriot and I got a question from Patriot about patrion. Do you have any idea how much of a financial hit patrion itself has taken because of the exodus of you, Jordan, Sam, etc. So I don't know, I mean I could extrapolate if I was to look at, you know, sort of the amount of money that I know we were making per month.

Speaker 2:          00:07:43       I have a general sense of what Jordan was making per month. I have a sort of sense but less so of what Sam was making per month. And let's say a couple other people, patriotic gets, you know, like 5% of each of us per month plus some other fees and things. Let's say it's 10% total. I'm, I'm actually not totally sure. Um, it's, it's a nice amount of money. Um, but considering as far as I know, Patrion got something like $450 million dollars in VC funding in the last couple of years. It's a small amount. So I don't think this is about while it is hurting them in the pocket. Right. And it's like they want to make as much money as possible. I think us taking the stand is more important. So look, if patrion crumbled after this, that's not really my goal here. But like if it started a chain reaction of people inside there that suddenly we're into free speech and don't like all of this d platforming and are afraid of the way the line is moving to exclude people.

Speaker 2:          00:08:32       I would be okay with that. But this is more about us just doing what we think is right. But by the way, look, people like Bret Weinstein, who I just mentioned, people I call them, I already, I mean, people that I love and admire are staying on Patrion for now. And maybe there's an argument to be said that if you stay and fight, that could be more effective. But I also liked the idea of, okay, some people say stay, some people go, some people write articles about it. Um, some people talk about it on social media, et Cetera, et cetera. There were more than, there's more than one way to skin a cat, so to speak. So, uh, I think we're all going to hit it from different angles and see what happened. But I do think that there is a, a technological and business solution to this and that's where I'm going to put a lot of my energies, although it's pretty bizarre.

Speaker 2:          00:09:11       I gotta I gotta show it around here, which is a job unto itself, a tour. We just got an offer last night to do a live Reuben reports for all of April taken me across America. I'll be in, uh, Australia with Jordan for most of February. I'm writing this book. We're probably going to head back out on the road in May and June with Jordan in Europe. So there's a lot of cooking and now I guess I'm a tech guy as well. Uh, so, you know, we'll see what happens. Shout outs to Jeffrey to gunner and to Richard and a Mug for Jared. You're getting a mug. Thank you very much guys. Really appreciate it. You guys are helping us do this thing and uh, I hope, I hope it's, look, if you care about these ideas, then I guess it is worth it to you. Let's see, a good luck on your endeavor of creating a new platform.

Speaker 2:          00:09:53       Thank you very much. Uh, make a blockchain based payment service. I can help hit me up. So I'm talking to a lot of people based on a well just, I'm getting a lot of recommendations. Let me say first about doing a lot of this through blockchain and taking more blockchain payments. So first off, just on the blockchain front, we are taking payments right now for uh, we're taking bitcoin payments@daverubin.com slash donate. Um, and we've been doing pretty nicely on there and you know, it goes up and it goes down and it's just sort of something to, to have. Um, I think there were more options. We're, we're looking into light coin, we're looking into a theory and we're looking into ripple and a couple of the others, we're looking into some blockchain based video stuff. I mean we're, we're just scaling through all of this.

Speaker 2:          00:10:35       And I see when I do these videos now I'm apparently a gajillion people that are watching these things because then people start slicing and dicing every word I said. Reuben said this about that and he said this thing about that thing. And the other thing about that, it's like, guys, we're just trying to work this thing through. You know what I mean? It's a weird thing cause I have noticed that the amount of hate that I'm getting these days has really ramped up and I don't really care. It's like I mute or I blocked these people. I'll give you just going to endlessly throw hate at me. Like I don't care for you. Really. It's like if I was walking down the street and somebody was like, Hey Ruben, go fuck yourself. It's not like I'd walk across the street and be like, oh, should we talk about that?

Speaker 2:          00:11:06       No. So I'm not going to do it online either. Um, but it's funny cause it's like I have so much good stuff happening and show is going great, like touring and all this good stuff. Um, and yet that isn't really what is the marker of success in a weird way. I see all these people writing about me and doing videos about me lying about me constantly. I'm like, Oh, if I'm somebody that they're doing that stuff about, I must really be a threat to these people. I guess I am successful. So that's the, that's actually a pretty good, all right. Shout outs to Christopher, Joel, David and Nicky and Alexander. You're getting a mug. Here we go. You've been signed Alexander. Thank you very much. Okay. Uh, good luck sticking it to the man. I closed all patriots support. I appreciate it. Are you coming to New York City anytime soon?

Speaker 2:          00:11:49       So we just got this offer for live Reuben reports as I said, uh, in a, in April, basically the entire month. Um, which will be pretty cool to be doing the show in front of it would be theater audiences, usually about a thousand people. One of the shows is in New York. I haven't signed on to the deal yet. I got it late last night and I haven't had a chance to fully dive into it, but that could potentially be in April. Um, let's see. Just change my $5 to 25 bucks monthly. Send me a medium. Been funding for a few years and got off the patriarch train before near. Good luck. I appreciate it. And uh, when you, when you submit via paypal or, or your credit card, we have your email and then we can figure out the sizes. So that's how we do that. Greetings from Argentina. I love what you're doing.

Speaker 2:          00:12:30       Uh, and what Jordan's doing. My question is have you too considered coming to South America? So I don't know why the, the Jordan toward didn't make it to South America. I'm not sure. It's on the docket for what we're thinking about in May and June. I'll, I'll ask on that. I'm actually not sure. Um, okay. Shout out to Steve and to Maureen. Thank you guys. Appreciate it. Um, thoughts on Coinbase economically, D platforming, Gab. So yeah, I heard about this and what's weird I guess, and again, I, I don't know everything about Crypto, but I know that Coinbase is one of the places I have a coin base account actually. Uh, Coinbase is one of the exchanges where you can buy and sell crypto. Apparently they booted Gab, but not only do they boot Gab, if I'm understanding this correctly, they booted the private account of the CEO of Gab, uh, Andrew something or other, I think his name is.

Speaker 2:          00:13:19       This strikes me as, as particularly odd, like unless they're doing something illegal, but this is, this is becoming increasingly the problem. We're going to slowly watch all sorts of maybe kind of potentially shady people. And I'm not even saying that this guy is a be pinned off and we're all going to think, oh, if I don't say anything, I'll be okay. I don't say anything. I'll be okay. But that's how it comes for everybody because nobody stands up. So I'm very proud to stand up, uh, with Jordan and, and see if we can figure this thing out. Um, so I'm not happy when I see any of these d platforming issues. Uh, I had lunch with Eric Weinstein yesterday and one of the things that we were talking about was that maybe what the Internet needs, and this is an interesting play on my, my small government believes, is that, look, I don't want the government telling these companies to know, uh, to telling them what they can do, right?

Speaker 2:          00:14:08       You all know that. Okay, but maybe what we need on the Internet is a public space. So in other words, if everything's private online right now, as it basically is, you've got all these roads going in every which direction everyone can be on any of these platforms. The platforms can get rid of anybody that they want, but there's no public space. And maybe what we need is a public space that is based, let's say it was made in the United States. The United States create some sort of public space online that stands by the principles of free speech and the first amendment. And beyond that, as long as you aren't doing anything doing anything that is illegal in the United States, you can do whatever you want. So think about it as like just a public park, right? So like if you're at a cafe next to the park, a crazy person can't walk in and start screaming like they're allowed to kick them out.

Speaker 2:          00:14:54       And that's what the private company could do. If they don't want the person there, they can kick them out. But that at least we would have a public space and public platform for people to be able to do whatever they want. That is based in American laws and, and the free speech principles that, that we all love. I think there's some way that Pi could actually sort of be for public funding being for something like that. That would actually be interesting because in a weird way, if we only have private things online and then nothing's really private and I think that that's what's happening right now. So there's something there I need to think it through a little bit more. Um, let's see. Dave, is there one particular rule out of Jordan's book that helped you the most? What are, that's a good question. Um, man, well I tell you, I've, you know, I've obviously heard Jordan lecture about the book, you know, a hundred some odd times. And you know, some nights I've, I've said this before, but some nights he does all the hill, you know, lecture for an hour and a half, about all 12 rules. He'll hit all 12 some nights. He picks three rules and he focuses on them some nights. He does one rule, some nights he does no rules and he talks about what someone else that's on his mind. Um, you know, I think

Speaker 3:          00:16:02       God,

Speaker 2:          00:16:04       is there one that's affected me more than the others?

Speaker 2:          00:16:10       Well I, it's Cliche to say the one about telling the truth. Right? Cause like you should try to tell the truth as much as you can. I'm always trying to tell the truth as much as they can. So I don't think it's that, um, you know, the one about petting a cat. If you see a cat pet a cat, now I'm allergic to cats. I don't like cats. Don't pet cats in my estimation. But he said, you can swap any animal for that. I'm a dog guy, but in effect, what he's saying there is just stop and smell the roses, right? Just you know when things are going well and you're in the thick of it, like don't get so lost that you don't remember to enjoy it. And when things are going bad that there's still some goodness out there kind of and start, try to pause and remember those things.

Speaker 2:          00:16:43       So for me right now, my life is moving very fast. I have very little time to come up and breathe. My, I tried to take a vacation around Christmas, the whole Patrion on thing happened and I didn't get a vacation. Like I haven't had a lot of slow down time, but try to take those little brief moments when there's a little bit of quiet or a little bit of something. Uh, I played my nine year old nephew and NBA Two k on playstation four online the other day. Like just try to do some things to whether it's petting a cat or petting the dog or whatever it is to enjoy a little of this, the craziness. All right. Shout outs to bud, Rudy and Theresa. David, you are getting a mug. Thank you very much. There you go. David to David and Joe, you're getting a mug.

Speaker 2:          00:17:25       Oh, I signed all these. Here we go. Got Another one down here. Thank you guys for the support. It is really appreciated, uh, on super chat. I found out about you via Collin. Good luck on everything. Thanks. So you're talking about column Moriarity every uh, obviously I love Collin. Uh, he's a great guy. He's been through the outrage machine and the mob and he has survived Collins doing his podcasts, sacred symbols with, uh, with Chris Ragan who you guys may know, who's also been on the show. Um, and Collin staying on Patrion on. And as I said, in no way do I judge him for it. And in certain respects I think having some of us on there and off their offers, the best form of attack, maybe having some of the guys stay on there still allows for them to fight from within. And maybe who knows, maybe, you know, between some of us go in and it's almost saying that the Patriot people, Jack Conti and Jacqueline Heart, the head of trust and safety, there'll be like, you know, maybe we should alter the terms of service a little bit.

Speaker 2:          00:18:20       Not that I would trust them, uh, because obviously conti came in here in lied directly to my face when he said that, you know, you're not going to be kicked off over speech, but you know, it's just another way of dealing with things. Everyone, everyone does things a little bit differently. You know, unfortunately the way the online conversation is, it's like everyone wants to behave, force everyone to behave the exact same way. And if you do anything even a little bit different, you're the enemy. And it's just like, I don't think that way and I'm not gonna live that way. Uh, thanks to Alexander, to Douglas and to David. Um, let's see, uh, church, I'm Dave. If Sargon had used actual slurs against someone and not just use a slur to quote someone's language back at them and Patrion had banned them, would you still have left? That's a really good, interesting philosophical question. So, okay, so the way for those of you that don't know the wake Sargon was using the n word in this specific video that was not on Patrion and not even on his youtube channel was he was basically using the language of the all right against them. He wasn't using the n word as a pejorative. So your question is a good one. If he had used the n word in a, in a racially offensive way, would would this have resonated with us the way that it did?

Speaker 2:          00:19:32       I don't know exactly. I don't. I, well, I certainly wouldn't want to defend him the way that I'm defending him right now. Like let's say, let's think about it. If it was a friend of yours, right? Let's say you found out that a friend of yours was truly a racist, was running around calling people the n word and it didn't like people because of their skin color or whatever that entails. Like would you really want to defend them? The answer's probably no. You might want, you might want to find out more about them and be like, is this part of the person I knew and whatever that is, but would, would we have all, I guess your question really is, would we have seen this as the opportunity to take a stand now if they, if he had been using the n word as a pejorative and in a racially offensive way against specific people, then it would have made this a little more of a messy situation where, where patriot, it would have more easily been able to say, you're not on Etsy.

Speaker 2:          00:20:23       That would have not been on platform also. Um, it would've made it messier. I think that's the best I can say short of being in the exact situation. It would have made it messier. Um, I'm for, I'm for all people to be able to say whatever words they want. I'm not afraid of words. You can call it. People call me all sorts of things. You'd call me a faggot or whatever you want to call me. I will survive. I really will. It's crazy. Someone says a word to me and I don't crumble. It's, it's incredible. Um, but at the end of the day, the, I still believe that these companies can do what they want. What is the solution? Well, now I'm coming around to this idea that a, there's a technological solution, that sort of decentralized solution, but it's not just that, it's also the fact that maybe we need these public spaces.

Speaker 2:          00:21:04       So we're at an interesting spot to be in. If you come from a classical liberal or libertarian position where you don't want the government doing things that aren't within its purview, that you might go, well, wait a minute. This is actually a good use of government. This is a good use of government dollars to be. We are going to create spaces, online platforms that allow people to be involved in conversations that allow people to be able to post video, to interact. All of those things, uh, that are public spaces that the only, there isn't a 27 page terms of service that you've got to look at with your lawyer that nobody has before you clicked accept that the only rules that you will have to abide by are the rules that you have to abide by as a citizen, which are the rules of the constitution and your local laws and things of that nature.

Speaker 2:          00:21:49       There's something to that and I want to think about it a little bit more. A reminder guys, if you go to Dave rubin.com/donate if you donate five bucks or above a, I'm going to give you a live shoutout 25 bucks or above. You're getting one of the last remaining monthly. By the way, 25 bucks or about monthly, you're getting one of the last remaining Rubin report, select tee shirts, which will never be produced again and for $50 or more. I will sign them up for you right now and you get the t shirt. So there you go. All right. Um, here have some money since I'm no longer on Patrion. Thank you very much. That was from super chat. Um, okay. Curious how you'll decide who will be allowed to join the new platform. Keep it open. Verse limit extremists. This is one of the many things that we're discussing right now.

Speaker 2:          00:22:33       We are discussing all of this stuff. Look, if we open it up to everybody, well then you know what happens. You're going to get all of the truly bad actors. They're real racist and white supremacists and Isis and all of the real bad guys that everyone agrees are the bad guys, you know, like that, that are probably up to criminal activity and all sorts of stuff. Now as long as they're not doing something specifically illegal, I think there's an argument to be made that they can be on there and express their right to express themselves. That may not be the platform that we are going to build here. We're really trying to figure this out like that. I'm not leading that answer in any weird way, like we're all having a sort of internal debate about that. Do we want to do something? Maybe the way the Internet is the, the nature of the, the future of the Internet is that not everything should be so big and everybody should be able to get on there and fight with everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:23:21       That may be, it should be invite only or a sort of white listed things, something like that. So we're figuring out all of these things. I think you guys know me, my general position on this is I want as little gatekeeping as possible. I would rather have as many voices as possible. I would rather have for all the people that have been banned on Twitter, it's like I'd rather have all those people back and if you don't like them, you mute them or you block them or you just ignore them. Um, but this subjective way that they do it is crazy. So it's like, so it's like Sargon is also banned on Twitter or Milo was banned on Twitter or Alex Jones and his band on Twitter. Okay fine. Twitter can do what it wants. But at the same time say Farrakhan is on Twitter, he said some he called Jews, termites and what a Twitter do.

Speaker 2:          00:24:02       They took away his blue check, but they left him on there. So it's like you can stay on our platform but we're not going to tell people who you are. No, no, no. I guess that's something or uh, you know, Hamas is on there, so you know, like really awful groups are on there. But we select basically if you're on, if you're more on the right, the groups that get booted. So it's this selective enforcement and this, this never ending a morphous terms of service that seems to always hit people on the right and not people on the left. Look, if you're on the left right now, anyone watching this or anyone watching the test me right now, anyone watching this, go on Twitter and call whoever you want, a white supremacist, you will not be banned. It's extremely damaging to call someone a white supremacist.

Speaker 2:          00:24:40       And, and it's, and it's usually slander. Um, but you can do it and there's no repercussions for it. Now go on and call someone the n word. Now I'm not saying do that. I'm not saying do that, but you get my point here is that we've got a selected way. We enforce these things. These companies can selectively enforce if they so choose. But maybe we need an option outside of these companies. And that's what I'm saying about that. Uh, shout out to Ryan and to Jord. You're getting a Mug, brother. Thank you very much. Welcome aboard the future of the Internet. Um, okay. Um, let's see. Uh, would you talk to Peter Schiff privately about if and how to incorporate crypto or a different payment system other than cryptos? He's, uh, he's brilliant. He's been on Joe Rogan's show a few times. I think we've traded some emails over the years and for some reason it didn't work out.

Speaker 2:          00:25:31       I'm not opposed to doing it. Um, and I am exploring all sorts of other financial options here. We're trying to figure it out. That's, that's what we're doing there. Uh, get bitcoin, Jesus on the show. I don't know who that is, but seems like an interesting guy. Uh, keep up the good work. Okay. Um, what, what donated 25 on the website? Need an extra large shirt. Loved the content if they hate you, you're doing good. Yeah, I'm definitely coming around to that one. It's like, all right, you guys are going to spend all day, like, can you imagine somebody like waking up and it's like, why did Ruben do aren't alive stream? What did he do? It's like, oh my God, get a life. But that's more than anything else. It's just like, what are you doing with your life? Um, okay. What are we doing here guys?

Speaker 2:          00:26:12       I'm giving away mugs $50 and above monthly at Ruben [inaudible] dot com. I'm going to sign it for you or a Dave ruben.com/donate 25 bucks or above. You're going to get a tee shirt. Uh, we're going to send it out to you. That's monthly and five bucks or above. Uh, I'm giving shout outs to anyone that jumps in. I am at the [inaudible]. Uh, I'm at the Ontario Improv tomorrow and with Bret Weinstein and I am at the Irvine Improv on January 30th within IDW member. Tbd. All right. Keep the questions flying in. Guys. A shout out to Joshua. Thank you very much. Welcome aboard. Uh, this is on super chat. Shout out to CBD, American Shaman of San Antonio. Are you a or are they selling CBD legally in Texas right now? Well, I guess CBD can be sold. This is where I'm always a little confused about the CBD situation. Um, but I haven't, you know, I have a friend who heard her shoulder and she's been using medicinal CBD, but, but out of cannabis.

Speaker 2:          00:27:09       And I think maybe if it's in Texas, you're getting them out of hemp. Um, I totally crossing this thing up. Uh, but anyway, it had a really bad shoulder. She had been used as in medicinal CBD. It seems to be working. So there you go. There's a little CBD, something for you. Keep up the good work. Another one of those. Okay. I will. Um, oh, here's a whole bunch more. I didn't scroll properly. Um, which crazy lefty would you most like to most like to interview and I'd love among, all right, well you can get a mug if you donate a over a day, ruby.com/donate which crazy lefty. Let's remove the word crazy for a second. There are plenty of lefties I would love to sit down with. Obviously, I'd love to sit down with Bernie and Elizabeth Warren and certainly Alexandria Cortez. Um, I would love to sit, you know, I offer it up to the celebrity types all the time.

Speaker 2:          00:27:50       So like a rob rider or a Judd Apatow or Sarah Silverman or Chelsea handler. I'll talk to any of these people. Look as long as you don't attack me personally or, or other people that I know personally. Like if you're, if your basic, um, behavior is decent and we can agree on what a conversation is, I'll talk to you. But if you're going to attack people, if you're gonna lie about people and all those things, I just don't want to do it. It's just not a game I want to be. I want to play, go play that game with somebody else. Um, okay. Where are we? Um, I love that hyperspace painting behind your couch. Keep it up. Oh yeah. If you saw the, uh, was, did I do both of those in there? I think I did both of the conversations with Jordan. That's in my, uh, in my living room.

Speaker 2:          00:28:31       It's a huge five foot by six foot, uh, hand painting of hyperspace. So Millennium Falcon going into hyperspace. That was done by Caitlin, Janet, by the way. I think her website is Kaitlyn rose, janet.com. She also did the painting that's behind me right now. The painting that's over there and a whole bunch of other stuff in my house. She's really phenomenal, versatile actress, actress. She's probably an actress to, uh, artists who can do almost anything. Let's see. Um, what are your thoughts? Uh, wait, have you heard of, have you heard the beauty and the Beta podcast where a caller mentioned is making an alternative to Patriot and he mentions you by name? It might be a good idea to get in contact with them. I haven't heard it. I did that podcast once. That's a Matt Christiansen, um, who's been a huge ally in this, in this Patrion, uh, fiasco.

Speaker 2:          00:29:18       Um, but I haven't heard of that one specifically, but I can't tell you that I've had a bajillion people just reach out to me. Here's a, you know, people are just coming up with ideas too, which is also cool. And it also shows you that this thing is going to be solved by human ingenuity, not by the government or not by just like the same old people. Like I don't think it's going to be the same old tech people that solve this, right? Like I actually think it's going to be new people that are doing it. And I wish I had time to respond to everybody that's reaching out to me and all that other stuff. Uh, shout outs, if you donate it, Dave rubin.com/donate a. Okay. And there's a shout out for Brooke. I made that. What happened quick. Okay, let's see. Uh, this is from superchat.

Speaker 2:          00:29:58       Coinbase is problematic, but you can still buy crypto on their platform and then move it to another wallet before sending it. Sending to support to Gab. Crypto is still the best option for censorship resistance. Uh, I also sent you $10 in Bitcoin. Well, thank you for that. Um, yeah, so from what I understand, if I'm really grasping this all property, you could properly, you could still forget putting gab aside for a second. Um, just the principle would be that you could still use Coinbase because you can use it as your wallet and then you can put your crypto at wherever else you want to put it. I got one of these, it's called the ledger. And that's where like a physical device that I have where I'm now keeping, uh, the crypto. So we're truly were truly just trying to figure this out alongside of you guys.

Speaker 2:          00:30:38       A mug for Zachary, you're getting a Mug, Zachary. Here you go. Oh, and somebody told me, but please confirm this before I, uh, before I ruin this way, somebody told me that. So if you put these in the, in the washing machine, sometimes the signature is going to be written. Even though I'm using, I'm using extreme fade resistant sharpie. Um, but it could wash off in the, in the dishwasher. Somebody told me that if you bake them up, but I can someone confirm this for me. If you bake the Mug, that the signature, uh, will stay in there. So I guess we will see about that. Um, the meaning of life is to give life meaning therefore isn't the key to life giving big love to you and Jordan. That's very profound. The meaning of life is to live it deleted as I said it.

Speaker 2:          00:31:26       All right, there you go. Um, let's see. Yo Dave, crazy idea. Invite Joe Rogan on the show. He always does the interviewing. So I think it would be cool to have him as the subject. Plus I think you guys would get along for the most part. Well I've been on Joe Rogan's show three times. I was on there the last time was uh, maybe may or June or so. I had just blown it, flown in from Atlanta that morning. I think that was may. Um, I love Joe. He knows he's welcome anytime the guy is beyond, beyond, beyond busy. He doesn't do that many shows. He did do. Ben Shapiro is a Sunday special, which I gave him a little shit for, uh, because he hadn't done my show yet. Uh, but I'm sure at some point it will be here. So Joe, if you're watching, cause I'm sure you're just sitting around watching these.

Speaker 2:          00:32:07       Uh, please, you're welcome on my show anytime. He knows he's on welcome. Anytime a shoutout to Othman. Thank you very much. A patron and canceling my Patriot on account. Now. You were the only person I was contributing to a, so thank you very much. We'll start up on your website a very soon. Um, another one on Patrion. I set up a recurring contribution directly on your website and I'm going to cancel my account with patron. Thank you for making me aware and leading the way from my small act of standing up to intolerance and oppression. Thank you very much. Uh, another one on Patrion. I just now canceled my pledge to the Rubin report from my Patriot on account. Okay. Did somebody already get the old coffee table? Oh yeah. So I mentioned in the live stream the other day that we've got our, you know, this is our new set, so we've got our old set, which are the old chairs.

Speaker 2:          00:32:48       We've got to have the old guest chairs, we've got the old coffee table, we've got the old, a lot of the old trinkets and things that are around here. Some of the old artwork. I thought maybe if people make us like some really great offers on that stuff, as long as we're raising funds right now, people could do that. So we did get a couple of offers. They were, they were kind of low, like it just wasn't worth parting with them at that level. Um, so yeah, if you want to make a great offer, you could just email us contact@rubenreport.com. Um, as I said, we've got to have the guest chairs. I'm not getting rid of my red chair cause I still use that when we do the three ways in here. Um, but we got the coffee table and a couple of other things so you can check that out.

Speaker 2:          00:33:25       Um, we'll your old shows be accessible somewhere. I'm behind in my recent retirement was going to afford me time to catch up. That's from patrion. I think what you're referring to is that you watched the show in the Patriot and feed. So to be clear, 100% of our content, especially if you're watching this right now, um, you're watching this via youtube. The video might be in the Patriot on fee, but this is all on youtube. 100% of our content will remain free. It will always be free. I am not putting content behind a paywall. The only thing we've ever done behind a pay wall as a couple like behind the scenes things or I ask our guests an extra question or something like that. We've never put any interviews behind a paywall. I am not gonna do that. I'm not starting a separate show behind a pay wall or anything along those lines.

Speaker 2:          00:34:05       As long as we can afford to produce the show as we're doing it and hopefully expand a bit and keep doing everything we're doing and I can keep working on other projects, which can also help fund all this. Um, you will, you will be able to see everything we've ever done. So right now if you're watching this person that asked me that question, every video that we have ever posted anywhere, it's all on youtube right now. Every interview we've ever done so you can catch it there. Uh, shout outs to Tony, Charles and Gary. I appreciate it. Thank you. Um, oh, I get this one a lot. What are some books that changed your life? Loved the show and everything you do, Dave. So I, I'll give the two books that I most give and then I'm going to start coming up with a newer answer for this on my bed right now on my nightstand right now, I keep a copy of on liberty by John Stuart Mill.

Speaker 2:          00:34:44       You can read it in a day. It's, it's that thick and it's just a wonderful explanation of the individual and what liberty and freedom are. And it's a great explainer of sort of classical liberalism as I see it. And then the other book that I would recommend, which I should have on set, um, but I don't cause all the books that we have on set actually are our books of former guests. And I wish I could've interviewed this guy, but he died about maybe 15 years ago. No, he died. I know the year he died. He died I think in [inaudible] 97 so, wow. 21 years ago, if I'm not mistaken. Carl Sagan, who was the incredible scientists who did a cosmos, the book and the, and the television show. His last book was called billions and billions. Uh, he actually died before it finished. And then his wife Andrea and who's also a professor at Cornell, she had to finish it for them.

Speaker 2:          00:35:31       And it was just sort of a broad explanation. It was a, it was a little bit easier to read than some of his other books, which were a technical, although he was an incredible explainer of science. Um, it's a broad sort of explainer about the way the world is and the way he sees it and when he sort of sees the future looking like, and it really just like sparked so much of the things that I care about. I mean a shout out to Steven and a Mug for Tom. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it. There you go, Tom. Um, let's see. Uh, why do you think crypto would help be specific? It's not a silver bullet. If you can't convert tender into crypto, it's useless. Too many hoops to jump. I'm not totally sure I understand the question. If you can't convert tender into crypto, it's useless.

Speaker 2:          00:36:16       But you can right now you can buy crypto using tender. So am I am I am not understanding the question? Maybe I'm not understanding the question. If you want to clarify the question a little bit more. Um, okay. Let's see. Um, Dave, you should consider inviting the author Robert Greene on the show. He's in California would be a great fit. I'm actually not totally sure. I who I, who that is. So if you want to write a little bit more, I will check it out. Um, okay. Let's see. Here's a second emphatic load for getting in touch with Peter Schiff. A crypto currency backed by gold. His thing is the most promising political solution in my view. All right, noted. I will, uh, let's, let's put Peter Schiff on the list. Guys. If he's not on there already, he must be on there already. Um, okay. How long do we got here?

Speaker 2:          00:37:00       What time is it? Three 37. I've got 23 minutes left guys. Uh, this is, I promise you this is the second to last fundraiser of the year. Even though we're in the first week of the year, or when we're in a week of the day of the year, a week and a day of the year, we're going to do one more of these. On January 15th I'm going to take my computer, I'm going to walk over to the camera right over there and you're going to watch me delete patron. You know, I shouldn't tell you something about what's going on with Patrion right now. So, um, so you know, I've done obviously a bunch of videos about leaving. I have sent emails to my email list about leaving. I have, we posted on Patrion that we're leaving. I've put it on Instagram. I mean, wherever you can put it, I put it. Um, but right now, despite all of that, we still have about 2000 people that are paying monthly on Patrion.

Speaker 2:          00:37:44       And I think if I'm not mistaken or last I checked the day or so ago, there was still about $14,000 a month of paying people on Patriot, meaning that if I didn't cancel patrion they would all be charged again on February 1st. So it's sort of interesting because it's like people buy into something and then you may not pay attention to the day to day. You may have unsigned for, uh, uh, an email list, let's say. And if you're not paying attention on Twitter and you don't check youtube for a couple of weeks or this or that or the other thing, it's like you may not even know. So it's such a weird thing. It's like, I'm going to say goodbye to this money. That in effect is like free money, but obviously I don't think it would be right to say I'm leaving and then not leave just to collect on that. So we're obviously not going to do that, but it'll be an interesting thing to see how much, how many people and how much is left in the account when I do this, a week from today.

Speaker 2:          00:38:28       Uh, that would be a, that would be interesting. Let's see. Um, shout out Henrik. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. Uh, all right, 20 minutes left guys. Dave rubin.com/donate get yourself a mug. Get yourself a Reuben select tee shirt. They're right here. I'm wearing one right now. I'm wearing a medium, by the way, if that gives you any perspective on sizing, they're quite comfortable. It's not like one of those crappy tee shirts. You know those crappy tee shirts you put on them? They feel like cardboard. It is not that. It feels nice. I think you'll like it. Uh, my dad often, where's the t shirt? When he's wandering around town and people say item, I want to take selfies with my dad. That's very weird. But people wanted to do it. Okay. Let's see what's going on here. Um, I got get bitcoin. Jesus is on the show.

Speaker 2:          00:39:12       I did that one already. Uh, when you inviting Matt Christiansen Christiansen on the show, so that was mentioned already about Matt. Yeah, we'll do it at some point. I think he lives in like Montana or Wyoming or something. Um, I don't know how often he gets out to la. You know, we can do these things by Skype, but I'm really trying not to do them unless it's either like a s a really big guest or somebody that's international that really just can't make it here. But if it's someone in the states that's mobile or whatever, I'd much rather do it in person. Um, also right now, just Fyi, um, we're booked out all through January. We've got a good Julian shows, we're taping a ton of stuff. Um, so really cool stuff. Oh, and tomorrow we taped this already. I've got an interview, uh, with behavioral scientists, Jeffrey Miller, who is a really, really site psychological behavioral scientists.

Speaker 2:          00:39:56       Jeffrey Miller. Really, really interesting guy. It was, it was one of my favorite interviews I've done in awhile and I think we've been on a nice, a nice run here. So that'll be a part one of that be up tomorrow. Um, let's see. I'll donate a hundred bucks if you answer these questions. Do you think you will shave your beard soon? The answer is no. I do love the beard and people love the beard. Everyone that I meet everywhere I go, they want to touch the beard. They love the beard. So I'm not going to shave the beard anytime soon. Although when I got the beard, which was not last August, but the August before when I did my thing off the grid and I just grew and grew it and grew it, and then I trimmed it a little bit before I came back on camera.

Speaker 2:          00:40:29       I thought I was going to maybe have it for like a month or so, but then everyone loved it and I really like it. So I'm going to keep the beard. And also, do you like Jordan Peterson better with a beard or without a beard? I liked him better with a beard. I like them better with the beard. I think there's something about, you know, his, there's something about his persona that a beard fits it, like his grain beard. Um, you know, he, he's, he's sort of the older wise professor. Um, he's, he's mentoring or helping a lot of people, um, you know, get their shit together and get their lives together. There's something that fits with a guy in a beard. Right? Like if this was a movie, like he's the older professor with a beard that's like teaching people some stuff. It seems like he would have a beard that's like a Harry Potter or star wars thing.

Speaker 2:          00:41:10       He would have a beard. Uh, when are you coming to Brazil? No plans at the moment. Yeah. As I said, I don't know why we're not doing much in South America. Um, on the Jordan tour. I'll, I'll look into that a little bit more. I'm actually not sure. Shout outs to George, to nick and to Matt. You guys sound like you could be a boy band and a, and a mug for Dennis. Welcome aboard, Dennis. There you go. That's a fine signature right there. You got it, Dennis. There you go. Um, okay. What else is going on here? So, wait, what else can I tell you? There's been so many things happening at once. It's like, it's hard to keep my head on straight in the midst of all of this. Um, oh, you know, I got a question for you guys actually, because you guys often give me some good advice on some things.

Speaker 2:          00:41:52       So I've, uh, I've shown her on video a couple of times, but my dog, Emma, she's 14 years old. I love, love, love this dog. Uh, I got her when she was two years old. She's actually from New Orleans, from Hurricane Katrina. And when the dog's got split up after the hurricane, they were sent all over the country and I assume all over the world actually. They actually found Emma in a box. Uh, and she had given birth during the hurricane and she was nursing three puppies and she was deathly sick because they're drinking all sorts of oils and in the water and all sorts of chemicals and grow stuff that's in the water. Though the puppies were actually healthy. She was really sick. Uh, the animals got sent all over the place. She had a collar with no tags, so they didn't know what her name was.

Speaker 2:          00:42:34       So she's actually had three names in life because when she was in New Orleans, she had a name. We don't know what that was. Then we got her at the humane society of New York, um, which is a great little non kill shelter. It's, it's not associated as far as I know with the Ma, the uh, national humane society. It's just the one in New York City. It's on 57th street between first and second, I think. And we got her there and they had named her Paisley and then when we got her, we named her, Emma and I had had her the first day I'm walking her, I got her walking her first day in central park and this woman comes up to me and says, is that Paisley from the humane society? I said, yeah. She said, this is her son Bernard. And they went crazy. They sniff, bought like only a mother and son could.

Speaker 2:          00:43:17       And you know, there was at, we used to get Bernard and Emma together often. Anyway, Bernard ended up moving to North Carolina. But how bizarre. Like they went all over the country and Bernard and Emma both ended up on the upper west anyway and it was about 14. Right now. She is the greatest, happiest one, most wonderful dog. We get people in, all my guests come into my home because my studio is here. People that don't like dogs end up absolutely loving her. Uh, but at 14, she's, she's not a a young pup anymore. And I've noticed that she's a little stiff in mostly in the back hips lately. So I'm thinking that maybe she has a little bit of arthritis or something. So I'm looking at all sorts of, um, uh, supplements and things that we can give her. And I know that they want you to take, it's a little counterintuitive.

Speaker 2:          00:43:55       You'd think you'd want them to rest more if they're in pain, but they actually tell you that an older dog should be walked more if they have arthritis cause that keeps them loose. Um, we can give them clues, glucosamine and Chondroitin. Try saying that three times fast and a whole bunch of other stuff in massages, heat pads. But if any of you have any great ideas on that, I would love to hear them, so please let me know. Um, okay. Uh, shout out to Pamela. Thank you very much and a Mug for Mike. Thank you very much guys. Appreciate it. You're keeping the Rubin report totally independent. I should mention actually what that means when I say we're completely independent. We are 100% independent period. I am the boss. The buck stops with me. That might be good. That might be bad. I think it's pretty good.

Speaker 2:          00:44:36       Um, but we, we treat all our, all of our employees great. You know, we take care of 100% of health insurance. We give Nice bonuses. I try to let everybody be as, as free as they can be, as long as they're doing their job and we get that respect back. We, we've got a great little operation here that I'm super proud of. And when I say we're independent, we have no, it's my production company. We run it as we see fit. The chances I'm ever going to fire myself. Pretty slim, I guess anything could happen. Um, but we're free to do what we think is right, which is why when I'm getting these offers from these networks, it's like it would take something crazy and I'm not even using this as a negotiating tool. It's like it would take something crazy for me to have a boss and not be in a studio in my home and all of the things like we really did this thing right somehow and knock on wood, we can keep doing it.

Speaker 2:          00:45:20       A shout out to sh to Chaz and a shout out to Louis. Um, and just a reminder, we've got about 15 minutes left that one week from today on January 15th we will be doing a live stream. You will watch me delete Patriana alive. I'm going to bring my computer right up to that camera right there and we're going to do it live a patriot and really proud of you Dave. There aren't many willing people willing to stick their necks out the way you and Mr. Peterson or doing 2019 is going to be an exciting year to say the least. We will definitely be switching contributions over Dave rubin.com/donate all the best. Thank you very much. Um, someone else on Patrion it's not so much that we are not paying attention to the day to day. I am hoping that Patrion figures this out. What they did for independent voices was nothing short of amazing and I'd hoped to be a creator myself.

Speaker 2:          00:46:04       The they're the only game in town sort of, and I want them to come to their senses and rethink their casual disregard for free speech. That's totally legit. And that's why I said for my friends that are staying on Patrion, I get it for someone like, like right now, like the idea that let's say Colin for example, column Moriarty who's obviously been on the show and it's a good buddy of mine, for those of you that are canceling patron patrion because of me, the idea that some of you might fund Collin as well and now he's not going to get that. That obviously it doesn't make me happy in any way. It actually upsets me, but I think everyone just has to do what they think is right. Like at the end, it's on you and you have to decide what to do look like.

Speaker 2:          00:46:42       I suppose there's probably some people that'll stay on there for Colin and then donate separately for me. You know, it's everyone, everyone or screw both of us want or whatever you think is right there. There you go. Shout outs to Lucille, to Robert and to Dimitri. Thank you guys. Um, beautiful story about Emma. Dave also IX to explain my last comment. Robert Green is the author of 48 laws of power. You'd really love his stuff. Uh, let's get the book. Can somebody write that down? We'll, we'll get the book. There we go and see what happens there. Keep it up. Dave, please donate my tee shirt. Um, I don't know if you're saying you're donating a tee shirt to us or something else, but thank you. Um, I've spent a thousand plus hours building a Patriana alternative with anticensorship features in the past year. What would be the best way to get in touch and present it to you guys?

Speaker 2:          00:47:28       So getting all sorts of offers like this and it's a little hard to track like who's legit, who isn't. I've had some phone calls where people that I think have been really interesting and some kind of go nowhere. Uh, contact@rubenreport.com is the best way to do it. My guys kind of go through it and the, and the most important ones get to me. And then if, if you're, if you're really onto something here, I hope so. And then we, you know, we do a zoom or a Skype or take a call and go from there. A super chat. I appreciate your willingness to stand up. Thank you very much. Um, super chat. The government slash payment processors can stop you using crypto if they really want to, especially the ones with transparency built in like bitcoin. So this, I need to learn more about this.

Speaker 2:          00:48:07       I fully admit that. Like, I don't fully understand how the government, if you were doing all the transactions were on Crypto, were crypto based, how would the government be tracking that? And I guess they could track if they had the specific, um, bitcoin number or the wallet number, Wallet Address, they could track what's going in there. I need to learn a little bit more about this. Guys, I'm, you're watching me do some of this stuff on the fly. Like that's just the truth. Uh, shout out to David. There you go. Um, oh, you know, speaking of doing some stuff on the fly, something funny happened the other day, so I did this live stream just like this. And you know, I'm taking questions right. And you guys can see these questions are just flying in, right? And my guys color code them sometimes if they think something's like particularly important for me to get to or, or that I need to read it quicker or whatever it is.

Speaker 2:          00:48:52       Right. Um, and so the other day I took, I don't know, I took 50 questions. I have no idea. And I'm just reading them on the fly. I'm, they're not censoring them. And then someone asked me something about Brazil and I said one little thing about how I need to know about and I need to know more. And then all of these people started writing. All these articles are doing these videos about how I'm backing a dictator in Brazil and I'm a fascist. And the rest of it, it's like, man, like Bill Kristol, formerly of the weekly standard, which just folded, he retweeted somebody saying something about me. And it's like, what are you people talking about? I said, one sentence in a two hour live stream, you're taking it totally out of context. And I admitted I need to know more about the topic. Like this sort of desire to destroy everybody.

Speaker 2:          00:49:34       It's like, it's going to destroy you guys. It ain't going to destroy me. It's going to destroy you guys. And deservingly. So, um, let's see. Um, Dave, is the new platform going to be 100% geared towards free speech or is it going to be an echo chamber? I promise you it is not going to be an echo chamber. As I've said, we're trying to figure out what the parameters around that mean. Is this an absolute place for everyone? I mean, I can be very clear. I don't want people doing criminal activity. I don't want child porn on there. I don't want terrorist activity on there. So an absolute free speech space within the content confines of the law. My goal is yes, but we have to figure out exactly what that, what that means and we're working on it. Uh, all right guys, we've got 10 minutes left.

Speaker 2:          00:50:18       So Dave rubin.com/donate you guys are the lifeblood of the show. You've already shown up for me here today as you have last time. I promise you we're only doing one more. Are these this entire year we're knocking them out by January 15th we will not do any sort of fundraising for the rest of the year. We're doing well. We've, we've obviously, we took a huge hit on Patrion and I'm, I'm now forcing it and, but we're making up a nice amount of it on our own website. Dave rubin.com/donate I'm, it's a short stop gap measure of getting rid of the Middle Guy. If you donate 50 in the next 10 minutes, I'm going to sign the Ruben Report Mug for Ya. If you donate 25 monthly in the next 10 minutes, I'm going to send you this tee shirt. And if it's you 50, you get the t shirt too. Okay, let's see. Um, find a chiropractor.

Speaker 2:          00:50:59       It saved my boy's life. Oh, I think you're talking about your dog. All right. Yeah. Oh, find a dog. Find a dog chiropractor. It saved my boy's life. Yeah. Um, yeah, I read that there are actual dog chiropractor, so I may take her to one of those. We'll see about that. Um, Dr Jon Bergmann studies on reversing arthritis may help you with Emma. As a side note, Dr. Joseph Dispenza is a great guest choice. So I'll look and I'll look into both of those. Can you guys write those down? Uh, thank you guys for that. I really appreciate it. Um, let's see. I'm a conservative and I just bought a Mug, but I wanted to give the Mug to a liberal teacher of mine because your show gave us common ground. Could you sign it for her? That's awesome. I can email you the info. Yes, I'd be happy to do that.

Speaker 2:          00:51:40       Helen, we'll keep an eye out. So email us, contact that Ruben, report.com remind us about this and I will sign it directly to her and you can give it to her. That's what it's all about. That's what it's all about. People don't hate each other for the most part. Like there are good liberals, there are good conservatives. There are even good progressive's I think their ideas are all terrible, basically. Right? Like you guys know that. I don't, that doesn't mean I think they're all terrible people are, are, are, are many of them I think confused sort of logically and, and um, and morally at, at a certain level. Uh, yes, I think so, but I don't think they're inherently bad people. Do I think that they think that they're doing the right thing. Yes. I think those things are the wrong things, but that's why we got to care about facts.

Speaker 2:          00:52:22       So it's like when, when AOC the other day she said this thing about, you know, too many people get hung up on on facts and making sure everything's exactly right as opposed to what's morally right. What, that's a pretty dangerous thing to say because we all have different morals. One of the topics we've spent in the last year talking about most, here's where to morals come from and the difference where, you know, Sam Harris says morals can come from facts that you, that are sort of right in front of you and we can figure out what we can derive value and meaning from. Fact. Some people Ben say and and Jordan would say that comes from a Judeo Christian ethic. It doesn't matter what the answer is, but the point is we believe different things or moral, but I don't want politicians who were on a moral crusade. I want politicians who look at the government, they go, this should be as least intrusive as possible and we're going to get out of the way and we're going to let people live freely.

Speaker 2:          00:53:12       And that's going to be a little messy and it's going to be, not everyone's going to get whatever they want, but we're not gonna keep taking from everybody to give to some and we're not gonna. Um, just, we're not going to be involved in every facet of everyone's life. Most bad things that have happened in the course of time have been done by government and we have to really remember that. Okay. Shout out to Elisa. There you go. Um, all right guys, we got six minutes left. Give me some good questions to end up strong on.

Speaker 4:          00:53:38       Uh, best

Speaker 2:          00:53:40       of luck, Dave and other best of luck. We got a whole bunch of best deluxe. Um, okay. Do you like many are chasm in Libertarian, political philosophy, a nightwatchman state or mini are chasm many or chasm I guess is a model of a state whose, who only functions, who's only functions are to provide citizens with the military. The police, the courts, thus protecting them from aggression, theft, breach of contract and fraud and enforcing property laws. I mean, that's not that far from what an ideal libertarian state would be. So I would need to know what do you mean, how is that different than what just a basic libertarian state would be? I mean, I'm for, I'm for and as much as possible, the states, each individual state deciding what it wants to do. If it wants to tax high or tax low, and that may be, that's going to either bring in business or lose business.

Speaker 2:          00:54:31       I'm for states deciding whether they want marijuana to be legal or not and maybe that's going to bring people in and help the economy or maybe it's going to force certain people to leave, um, for states deciding how much tax money they want to take to put into education versus whether they want to, uh, put it into funding a baseball stadium or whatever else. I want that experiment, that incredibly beautiful American experiment of testing this and that and seeing what works and seeing where people move and where they stay away from. Uh, and where freedom prospers and where people can make the most out of their lives and in what laws cause people to leave. That that experiment is awesome to me. And I'm for anything that would lead to more of that. So what you just laid out there for me is pretty congruent with most of the things that I believe.

Speaker 2:          00:55:12       Um, but I, I would need to know a little bit more. Um, let's see. Super Chat. Yossi being a patrion being a patron isn't enough. What am I buying here? I don't know that you're buying anything, but it has been nice getting to know you a little bit. That, that is actually one of the things. One of the things is that I've been able to meet a lot of these patron, uh, people and I've had dinner with some people and when I was on the road with Jordan, I would get coffee with people and chat with people. There's something cool happening here. There's something cool. All right, we've got four minutes left people. These are your last chances right now during this live stream to get the mug or the t shirt. I'm going to sign mugs. How many more here? I've got four in this box right now.

Speaker 2:          00:55:47       Can we get rid of all these four? I got a of your box right here, but I've got four remaining. And you know what, if you do it for these last four, cause we got four minutes left. I got four mugs for these law. Anyone else that gets on until we shut down in four minutes? I'll actually put your name on it too. There you go. Uh, rude. Uh, Dave Rubin, [inaudible] dot com slash donate 50 bucks monthly. You're going to get the mug. I'm going to put your name on it and you're going to get the t shirt and you're going to feel good about yourself. We should be selling totes. Okay. Uh, all right, Tanner and Eric, I'm writing your name. There you go. Tanner and Eric, I don't know if you guys were signing up before I did it, but Tanner, you're getting a mug. Tanner, I even put an exclamation point after your name. That's exciting. And Eric with a c. K the rare c. K. Eric. All right, very good. Eric, you're getting a mug. Eric.

Speaker 2:          00:56:41       Eric, you got a comma I gave. I gave the other guy a, uh, an exclamation point. Brandon. Thank you very much. All right guys, getting rid of these last couple of mugs right here. Dave ruby.com/donate. We've got three minutes left. I talked a lot today. I mean, try to imagine. I did. I did two full on interviews. Then I did a half hour interview. Then I did, I started the morning at 7:00 AM with a radio station and, um, Altoona, Pennsylvania, I think, which actually was totally fun. Um, let's see why. Oh, this is a great question. Why is the Reuben, we're based out of California if that state's economic and political climate is as bad as conservatives say. Is it exaggeration now? Um, well, I don't think it's as bad. So first off, the taxes here are in sane. They're absolutely insane. Now, I do have a business here, so I'm able to write off a lot of stuff, right?

Speaker 2:          00:57:26       So if we buy a whole bunch of bugs, um, we were able to write that off as a business expense, obviously. Uh, there's some other things that we're able to write off that, you know, business expenses when we buy equipment and computers and things of that nature. Um, so that helps a little bit on the tax front. Um, why is it here? I mean the main reason it's here is that in La specifically is um, that will a, I moved to La, it'll be six years in February and when I moved to La, um, it was sort of at the beginning of all of this and I was just trying to get a gig that I thought was cool and whatever. I hadn't really, um, sort of figured all this stuff out. What I would say now is a, I mean first off, so cow la, the weather is great.

Speaker 2:          00:58:06       Like it is 80 and sunny almost every day. The worst day in cal is like the best day almost everywhere else instead of San Diego. But you're going to pay for that because a lot of people want to live here obviously. But, but that's not eight, although I do enjoy the weather for sure. The, the real thing that keeps me here right now is that, um, there really is a nice thing growing in Los Angeles, a nice sort of center, right? Classical, liberal, Libertarian, conservative thing. Rowing right here in la. I mean, look, Ben Shapiro's here, Peter Teal just moved down here. A Dennis Prager is here. Um, but then there's other people that aren't, don't necessarily fit into that. Sam Harris is here. I mean there's, there's a lot of people in the Los Angeles area, you know, because the thing is that as politics, as politics collide more with media, right?

Speaker 2:          00:58:50       And his politics becomes more invested in what's going on with the digital world and youtube and all that. Well now and La is the home of entertainment and now politics is kind of becoming entertainment. Now. That may be terrible for the longterm health of the country, but it's something that's happening right now. So I think this, the, the whole gestalt of that, I would say is the reason that I'm here just stalled. Good word, by the way. I'm all right guys. We got one minute left. How many more mugs am I going to get rid of? Uh, we will be doing another one of these on January 15th when I will be, uh, shutting down Patrion on live right here. Uh, it's Dave Ruby. Com slash donate. And uh, here's what we'll do just in case you were about to sign on right now because it is four o'clock and I got to go, I think the Tucker guys waiting for me outside.

Speaker 2:          00:59:29       Uh, anyone that donates in the next 10 minutes till four 10. We're going to shut the stream in a sec, but if you don't eat in the next 10 minutes, uh, we'll, and you get the mug. I'm going to put your name on the Mug itself anyway, we'll do another one of these next week. We got Jeffrey Miller on tomorrow. Um, we've got another bunch of cool shows coming up over the rest of the month. Then I hit Australia for most of February with Jordan. Uh, then I'm back here in March and we're, we're already, we're like overbooked already, but we'll leave some room in case some interesting things pop up. Then I may take the Ruben report on the road for April. I got to look at that deal and see where we're at on that. Then Jordan, I may hit the road again or it sounds like we are a for May and June back to Europe and uh, yeah, let's just keep going.

Speaker 2:          01:00:10       Right. Why not when he got better to do so. Uh, thank you guys. Thank you everybody that just donated. You guys are the lifeblood of this thing. You're keeping it going. Uh, we're, we're going to be okay. Like if we don't get any more donations, we are going to be okay. But the more we get, we can keep growing and expanding and all that stuff. But, but truly, when I, when I said we were leaving Patrion I did not know what was going to happen. Like I didn't know if we said, okay, well people go to our website. Like I didn't know if we were gonna wake up and it was going to be like 15 people went there and we got a couple hundred bucks. I'm like, I've got to lay off. People are like, figure out something else to do. Um, but you guys have shown up.

Speaker 2:          01:00:42       You really have. It's, it's, it's incredible. It's humbling. It's awesome. You make me want to be a better man. I am looking forward to seeing some of you guys tomorrow night at the Ontario Improv in so cal with Bret Weinstein. January 30th at the Irvine Improv. January 29th. I'm at cal state. Uh, ah, I'm blank. And where am I? Cal State somewhere? Um, yeah, I mean, I think I'm at cal state. Uh, the, uh, the College Republicans are inviting me. I would've been glad to talk to the College Democrats, but they, they never invite me anywhere. Um, and uh, all right, that's it. Catch me on Tucker. I think I'll be on at eight 45 eastern, which is about five or 15 minutes before this Trump guy has given a talk about the wall. So, all right, I'll see you guys around. Thanks a lot.
