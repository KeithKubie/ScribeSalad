00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:04.690
&gt;&gt; Male Presenter: So we're very thrilled
to welcome Michael Nielsen today. He's a legend

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:07.890
in
computer science and one of the pioneers in

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:13.169
quantum computing. In fact, he
co-wrote the standard text on it. And this

00:00:13.169 --> 00:00:16.880
document was actually listed in
Google scholars -- one of the top-ten most

00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.821
cited physics books of all time which
is a pretty weighty distinction. And so, right

00:00:23.821 --> 00:00:28.130
now Michael lives in Toronto
where he focuses his craft on writing. And

00:00:28.130 --> 00:00:33.329
so, today he's going to speak to us
on his latest book which is entitled "Reinventing

00:00:33.329 --> 00:00:37.980
Discovery -- The New Era of Networked
Science. This book delves further into themes

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.329
that he first explored in his book, "The Future
of

00:00:41.329 --> 00:00:44.829
Science." And so, we'll have some time for
questions and answers at the end and without

00:00:44.829 --> 00:00:48.079
further ado, please join me in welcoming Michael
to Google. Thanks.

00:00:48.079 --> 00:00:49.079
[Applause]

00:00:49.079 --> 00:00:57.289
&gt;&gt; Michael: Thank you so much. Thank you all
for being here today. I was actually at a

00:00:57.289 --> 00:01:01.899
event at the Library of Congress couple years
ago. So I was on, 'Michael Nielsen',

00:01:01.899 --> 00:01:06.150
and there was also 'Mike Nelson' on the panel
which caused quite some confusion

00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:12.390
when audience members were directing questions
to us. So my talk today is about

00:01:12.390 --> 00:01:18.390
open science which sits in roughly the same
relationship to science -- basic

00:01:18.390 --> 00:01:23.140
scientific research. Mostly Academic research
I'll be talking about. As open source software

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:28.070
does to the
commercial software world. And so, what I

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:32.570
want to explore is the extent to which
open source principles or style principles

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:36.930
can be applied to the practice of
basic scientific research. So I'm going to

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:41.750
start off with an example where this
has been done successfully. So the example

00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:47.450
starts with this man -- Timothy
Gowers. Gowers is a mathematician. He's actually

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.390
one of the world's leading mathematicians.
He's, amongst other things, the recipient

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:55.230
of the Fields medal, which is often called
the Nobel Prize, or compared to the Nobel

00:01:55.230 --> 00:02:01.720
Prize in mathematics. Gowers, in
addition to being a Nobel, Fields winning

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:07.350
mathematician, is also a blogger. It's
not that uncommon actually amongst leading

00:02:07.350 --> 00:02:11.500
mathematicians. Of the 42 living Fields medalists,
four of

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:16.630
them have started blogs. So that's about one
in ten. I don't know how

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:20.850
that compares to the general population, but
it's pretty good. Anyway, in

00:02:20.850 --> 00:02:27.950
January of 2009, Gowers wrote this very interesting
post entitled "Is massive collaborative mathematics

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:35.200
possible?" And what he was proposing to do
in this post was to use his blog as a medium

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:40.610
to attack a difficult unsolved mathematical
problem, a problem which he said he would

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:47.790
like too solve. Completely in the open
using his blog as a way of posting his partial

00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.970
progress and his ideas. And
what's more, he issued an open invitation

00:02:52.970 --> 00:02:57.120
inviting anybody in the world who thought
that they had an idea they'd like to contribute

00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:02.940
to post that idea in the comment section of
the blog. He called

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:08.280
this experiment the Polymath Project. Well,
the Polymath Project actually got

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:13.242
to quite a slow start. In the first seven
or eight hours after he opened up his

00:03:13.242 --> 00:03:19.220
blog up for comments not a single person wrote
in with any suggestions. But then a

00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:23.560
mathematician at the University of British
Colombia person named Jozsef Solymosi posted

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:26.099
a suggestion. Basically it's a variation of,
a

00:03:26.099 --> 00:03:29.970
simplified variation of problem which he was
suggesting. Might be a bit easier

00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:34.940
to attack. And then 15 minutes after that,
high school teacher in fact from

00:03:34.940 --> 00:03:41.069
Arizona named Jason Dyer wrote a short suggestion.
And just three minutes after

00:03:41.069 --> 00:03:46.880
that, Terence Tao also a Fields medalist.
He's a mathematician at UCLA, posted a suggestion.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:49.990
And so,
things were really off and running at this

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:55.570
point. Over the next 37 days, in fact 27 different
people would post 800

00:03:55.570 --> 00:04:03.489
substantive mathematical comments containing
170,000 words. That's a lot of

00:04:03.489 --> 00:04:08.540
mathematics done very quickly. It was hard
actually -- I was following along. I

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:13.099
didn't contribute substantively, but I was
following along quite closely. And

00:04:13.099 --> 00:04:17.940
it was difficult simply to find the time to
just read all the contributions. It

00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:22.780
was really going remarkably quickly. You see
people propose an idea in a very

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.270
half-baked form and then very often it would
be rapidly developed sometimes by

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:30.840
other people. Sometimes it would be discarded
but other times it would be

00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:36.190
incorporated into the canon of knowledge.
Gowers described his process as being

00:04:36.190 --> 00:04:42.630
to normal research as driving is to pushing
a car. And at the end of the 37

00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:48.120
days, he used his blog to announce that the
problem had most probably been solved.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:51.840
In fact, it's like a generalization of the
original problem which they were

00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:55.160
attacking. They still had to go to back and
check that they hadn't make any

00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:00.160
silly mistakes that everything did indeed
check out ultimately and they wrote

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:04.460
two papers based on it. It took two months
more to do the clean up work, but

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:09.410
the back of the problem had, in fact, been
solved at this point. Now, of course, the

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:13.150
reason I'm talking about this Polymath Project
is not particularly because of

00:05:13.150 --> 00:05:17.630
the particular mathematical problem. It's
not important because it solved the

00:05:17.630 --> 00:05:22.380
particular mathematical problem. It's rather
important because of what it

00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:27.919
suggests. It suggests that we can use some
of these sorts of tools as cognitive

00:05:27.919 --> 00:05:34.900
tools to speed up the solution not of simple
everyday problems but actually of

00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:40.070
problems which challenge some of the smartest
people in the world. That's really

00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:45.160
exciting. These are problems right at the
limit of human intellectual ability.

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:50.760
And not just one particular problem -- but
perhaps broadly across many different

00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:55.220
fields. Now, of course, there are a tremendous
number of similarities and

00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:02.740
differences to the open source software world.
I'm going to talk not so much

00:06:02.740 --> 00:06:05.370
about the similarities. I'm going to talk
a little bit about some of the

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:07.761
differences today. In particular, I'm going
to talk about some of the

00:06:07.761 --> 00:06:13.729
challenges and the reasons why this kind of
approach is not more broadly adopted

00:06:13.729 --> 00:06:18.130
within science at present. And my focus today
is certainly going to be very

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:22.259
much on basic science. That's the tradition
I came out of. I was an academic

00:06:22.259 --> 00:06:27.729
for 13 years. So that's where my focus will
be. I realize it's a little bit

00:06:27.729 --> 00:06:33.272
different than Google's focus. But you come
on this journey with me. So I want

00:06:33.272 --> 00:06:38.160
to talk about a second example right now partially
to illustrate this idea that

00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:43.211
it's a really broad acceleration to be expected.
So I'm going to talk about an

00:06:43.211 --> 00:06:49.290
example from a completely different part of
science. I'll start again with a

00:06:49.290 --> 00:06:54.711
story involving a single person. It's this
woman Nita Umashankar. In 2003 when

00:06:54.711 --> 00:07:03.460
she was 23, she had just finished up her undergraduate
education at the University of Arizona in

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.229
Tucson. She went to work for a a year
for a year where she worked for a not-for-profit

00:07:08.229 --> 00:07:13.020
organization to help young Indian
women escape from prostitution. Depending

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:14.960
on whose estimates you believe, there are
anywhere between

00:07:14.960 --> 00:07:20.370
several hundred thousand and several million
women involved in prostitution in India. But

00:07:20.370 --> 00:07:25.419
what she found was really tremendously
frustrating. What she found was a lot of these

00:07:25.419 --> 00:07:32.430
young women don't have skills to
hold down a job outside prostitution. So she

00:07:32.430 --> 00:07:35.449
went back to the United States
at the end of the year. And after thinking

00:07:35.449 --> 00:07:39.070
about the problem, she decided to start a
new organization

00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:43.100
called the ASSET India Foundation that would
address what she believed was the

00:07:43.100 --> 00:07:48.770
core problem by opening technology training
centers in India and providing these

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:52.060
young women with training in technology then
helping them find placement with

00:07:52.060 --> 00:07:59.210
some of India's bit technology companies.
Well, it's seven years later now and they've

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:02.430
opened
training centers in 5 large Indian cities.

00:08:02.430 --> 00:08:06.270
And they claim that hundreds of young women
have completed

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:12.690
their programs and been found placement. Which
is great. What they'd like to do, of course,

00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:16.560
is to expand. In particular, they'd like to
expand into some of India's smaller

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:22.540
cities. And this poses many challenges one
of which is some of the smaller

00:08:22.540 --> 00:08:27.590
cities don't have the reliable electricity
which they need to run their

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:32.770
technology training centers. So they've considered
all sorts of ways around

00:08:32.770 --> 00:08:36.800
this. Obviously this causes all sorts of of
potential problems for them. One of

00:08:36.800 --> 00:08:41.510
the things they focused on was wireless routers
to access the Internet. So they

00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:49.040
experimented with available, commercial, off-the-shelf,
wireless routers. Excuse me -- available,

00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:54.980
commercial, solar-
powered, wireless routers. And they found

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:59.770
what was available was not suitable for
their local needs. And the way they addressed

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:03.630
this problem -- have been
addressing this problem -- is quite interesting.

00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.560
They went to a company
on the other side of the world, just outside

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:11.080
of Boston in Waltham named Innocentive. Innocentive
is actually a online marketplace for

00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:17.520
scientific problems. It's a bit like Ebay
or CraigsList but instead of posting a description

00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:22.300
of your furniture or car
or whatever you can post a description of

00:09:22.300 --> 00:09:29.550
a scientific problem that you would like
solved together with a prize for the solution.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.330
Typical kind of an organization
that posts an incentive would be somebody

00:09:33.330 --> 00:09:36.730
like Eli Lilly for example. It's
actually a spin-off of Eli Lilly. But many

00:09:36.730 --> 00:09:40.731
other similar organizations make use of it.
This

00:09:40.731 --> 00:09:46.310
is probably their best, most famous challenge.
It's a few years old now. It's to find

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:51.980
a biomarker for ALS. They had a $1 million
prize. It's actually a bit unusual; that's

00:09:51.980 --> 00:09:57.130
a very large prize. More
typical prize is 10,000 dollars, 30,000 dollars,

00:09:57.130 --> 00:10:04.750
50,000 dollars. That kind of
scale. Anyway. What ASSET did was, together

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:11.130
with the Rockefeller Foundation,
they put up a 20,000 dollar prize for an Innocentive

00:10:11.130 --> 00:10:15.000
challenge to design a low cost, reliable,
solar-powered,

00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.981
wireless router that could be made with parts
that were easily accessible to the people

00:10:19.981 --> 00:10:24.269
in India.
So Innocentive broadcast this out to their

00:10:24.269 --> 00:10:27.940
network. Solvers around the world.
They claim they have a couple hundred thousand

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:33.080
people in their network. Who knows
how many of those are actually active. The

00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:38.990
number who actually downloaded the
challenge was 400. What I say downloaded the

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:41.170
challenge, I don't mean looked at the abstract
or whatever.

00:10:41.170 --> 00:10:45.490
That's certainly a larger number. This is
the detailed description with all the

00:10:45.490 --> 00:10:49.000
IP provisions and a whole bunch of stuff like
that. So this indicates some

00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:55.330
reasonably serious level of interest. 27 of
those people submitted solutions.

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.940
And the winner was a software engineer from
Texas named Zacary Brown. So he

00:10:59.940 --> 00:11:07.550
did a few interesting hobbies or talents.
One was that he was certainly -- as

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:12.100
part of his day job -- an expert in Linux
and other sorts of open source software and

00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:17.209
low cost software. But
perhaps more relevant was that at home in

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:23.300
his spare time as a hobby he built
homemade wireless radio networks. And he was

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.260
working towards a goal of making contact
with every country in the world. That was

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:32.880
probably number one. The second
interesting talent that he had was--. Well,

00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:38.430
he told me in e-mail, actually, when he
was growing up, he'd be watching television

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:45.390
one day and he'd seen solar panels
being installed at the Carter White House.

00:11:45.390 --> 00:11:48.730
And he'd asked his parents what they
were. And he was enthralled -- that was his

00:11:48.730 --> 00:11:54.760
word -- to discover you could take
sunlight and convert it into electricity.

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:58.519
So as an adult, he was working on
converting his entire home office including

00:11:58.519 --> 00:12:04.899
his wireless radio networks to solar power.
So if there was one person in the world that

00:12:04.899 --> 00:12:10.040
you wanted to get working on this
problem for ASSET, he would certainly be on

00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.769
your short list at least I think.
And all Innocentive did was provided a way

00:12:14.769 --> 00:12:20.160
of making that connection. So in some
sense, what's going on or what's in common

00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:25.040
between the Polymath Project and
this ASSET Innocentive story is in some sense

00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.100
we already had with the human race
if you want to look really broadly -- already

00:12:29.100 --> 00:12:35.470
had all the expertise to solve
challenging and important problem. And what

00:12:35.470 --> 00:12:39.020
the two, these online tools did
is they provided a way of activating that

00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.020
latent expertise.

00:12:40.020 --> 00:12:45.399
It was all are there. It was almost trivial.
They activated it. In other

00:12:45.399 --> 00:12:49.350
words, they connected the right expert to
the right problem at the right time.

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:53.610
And that's very obviously true in this story
I told you about Innocentive . It's

00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:59.300
also true in the Polymath Project. But if
you actually read through the

00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:03.650
archives of the Polymath Project . You see
an interesting dynamic. Somebody

00:13:03.650 --> 00:13:07.430
says, "Oh, here's my half-baked suggestion
and they can't go any further." And

00:13:07.430 --> 00:13:09.950
somebody else says, "Oh, that makes me think
of." And somebody else says, "That

00:13:09.950 --> 00:13:14.870
makes me think of." Etc. etc. etc. That's
exactly the kind of thing that goes

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.730
on any good creative conversation. But what's
interesting about it to some

00:13:19.730 --> 00:13:25.120
extent is that it's just done at a much larger
scale, right? And that's

00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:29.730
valuable, because it means that you can bring
in more expertise from more people

00:13:29.730 --> 00:13:32.700
from all over the world. In fact, these were
people who would have had a hard

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:38.709
time getting together all in one room. In
some sense what was going on was

00:13:38.709 --> 00:13:43.579
restructuring of expert attention or a redirecting
of it. Instead of Zacary

00:13:43.579 --> 00:13:47.320
Brown or the Polymath sitting at home doing
whatever it is they would

00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:52.209
ordinarily do, working on their wireless radio
network, they were able to use their expertise

00:13:52.209 --> 00:13:56.260
in much higher leverage ways.
So it's kind of an interesting broad general

00:13:56.260 --> 00:14:00.990
question here which is how can we design
tools to allocate expert attention optimally?

00:14:00.990 --> 00:14:05.779
I'm not going to say very much
about this, but there's a few interesting

00:14:05.779 --> 00:14:10.089
remarks. One is a technical problem,
which is how to allocate attention where people

00:14:10.089 --> 00:14:14.220
have maximal comparative
advantage. So that they're working on the

00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:19.649
right things. In addition to that
very challenging technical problem, there's

00:14:19.649 --> 00:14:23.490
also an incentive problem. Which is
even if you can direct their attention in

00:14:23.490 --> 00:14:27.730
that way, if you have the technical
tools. There's the question of are they actually

00:14:27.730 --> 00:14:31.389
going to want to do it? So
you want to align their individual incentives

00:14:31.389 --> 00:14:38.100
with this optimal allocation. And
at some level, you can look at lots of different

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.490
tools. Certainly you can look
at Polymath and Innocentive. You can look

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:45.019
at lots of other things. I think about things
like GitHub, particularly the issue tracker

00:14:45.019 --> 00:14:49.200
on GitHub, IRC channels for open source software
projects.

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.810
And many other things like this. Are
all partial attempts to solve this problem

00:14:54.810 --> 00:14:58.530
where you can all view them through
that kind of lens. And I think it's interesting

00:14:58.530 --> 00:15:01.769
to view them through that kind
of lens. So I'm going to switch away from

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:07.200
this topic. It's something I talk
about more in my book. But I don't have time

00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:12.079
to talk about today. I do think
it's an interesting general way of thinking

00:15:12.079 --> 00:15:16.829
-- treating expert attention in
diverse types of expertise as a scarce resource,

00:15:16.829 --> 00:15:20.360
as though you have a resource
allocation problem. Something I'll actually

00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.180
just mention this. Something I've often
wondered. You're really talking about designing

00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:30.230
markets here and whether or not
there are connections to ideas which have

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:36.519
been developed around things like Ad
Words and whatnot over the last many years.

00:15:36.519 --> 00:15:37.730
I don't know the answer to that question,
but

00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.750
I'd be interested in people's comments. Okay,
new topic or slight

00:15:41.750 --> 00:15:46.769
change of topic. What I want to talk about
is why scientists have been so

00:15:46.769 --> 00:15:50.431
inhibited in adopting many of these tools.
And they certainly have been, if you

00:15:50.431 --> 00:15:54.889
look broadly across the sciences. So I'm going
to tell the story of a few

00:15:54.889 --> 00:15:59.040
failures of ideas that in my opinion should
have succeeded. Certainly more than

00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:03.730
they have. So the first one is a site called
the Qwiki . This was started by

00:16:03.730 --> 00:16:10.170
a grad student in Cal Tech name John Stockton
in 2005. It stands for Quantum Wiki. It was

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:15.720
a attempt to start a research level type Wikipedia
for the quantum computing

00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.399
community. So his idea was to recruit people
essentially to write almost a

00:16:20.399 --> 00:16:24.820
super textbook for the field. It would be
very rapidly updated with the

00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:29.570
information about the latest discoveries in
the field. Discussions about the big open

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:35.620
problems. People's speculation about how those
problems and so on. Good idea.

00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:40.949
I happen to be present at the workshop where
it was announced at Cal Tech in 2005. It was

00:16:40.949 --> 00:16:45.110
very interesting to chat with people at that
workshop. Some of them were

00:16:45.110 --> 00:16:48.529
extremely skeptical. "this is a total waste
of time. Why would you ever want to

00:16:48.529 --> 00:16:53.399
do that." Actually, quite a lot of large fraction
of people were very friendly to the idea and

00:16:53.399 --> 00:16:56.959
extremely excited
"You could have conversations. Oh, you could

00:16:56.959 --> 00:16:59.519
use it to do this. You could use it to do
that. You could share

00:16:59.519 --> 00:17:04.100
experimental protocols." Etc. etc. etc. . You'd
have these 5-minute

00:17:04.100 --> 00:17:08.749
conversation. And then say, "so what are you
planning to do?" "oh, no no no –

00:17:08.749 --> 00:17:13.059
I don't have time to contribute. But, jeez,
I hope someone else will take the

00:17:13.059 --> 00:17:18.380
time to implement these brilliant ideas."
And of course, if enough people think

00:17:18.380 --> 00:17:23.309
that way, it was inevitable that ultimately
it would fail. I should say by the

00:17:23.309 --> 00:17:26.970
way, I've picked this example partially because
Mr. Stockton did a lot of things

00:17:26.970 --> 00:17:34.529
very right. Did not fail because he messed
up. He seeded it with lots of very

00:17:34.529 --> 00:17:39.289
good material. He certainly tried to twist
various people's arms so that they

00:17:39.289 --> 00:17:43.859
would contribute material. He did a reasonable
job of marketing it and so on.

00:17:43.859 --> 00:17:48.019
It did not fail just because he messed up.
And you can repeat this story across

00:17:48.019 --> 00:17:53.840
many many similar science wikis. They often
contain lots of great content

00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:57.929
contributed -- it's always contributed by
just one person or maybe one person

00:17:57.929 --> 00:18:02.991
with one or two buddies. You know, that's
a very typical kind of scenario. You

00:18:02.991 --> 00:18:09.080
look at the Knot Atlas kind of similar. String
Theory Wiki. And there's actually similar

00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.960
stories. I should say actually when I say
they failed, I'm just talking about in terms

00:18:11.960 --> 00:18:15.389
of recruiting a large
number of contributors to collaboratively

00:18:15.389 --> 00:18:19.179
build this. They're actually often big
successes in terms of lots of people want

00:18:19.179 --> 00:18:24.870
to access these sites. The download
statistics are often pretty impressive. But

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.350
yeah, lots of people want to read the
content. They just don't want to contribute

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:33.720
anything. Okay. So similar sort
of idea. Just picked a couple at random. Scientific

00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.360
wikis and scientific
social networks. This is kind of the Facebook

00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:43.210
for scientists idea. The notion or idea being
to connect scientists to other scientists

00:18:43.210 --> 00:18:48.499
with complementary
interests so they can share code, share data,

00:18:48.499 --> 00:18:54.359
share ideas and so on. And there's
been a lot of money bought into developing

00:18:54.359 --> 00:18:58.909
these. I don't know maybe several
dozen of them. I just randomly picked a few.

00:18:58.909 --> 00:19:03.539
And you create a account on such
a site. You log in. And typically what you

00:19:03.539 --> 00:19:08.379
find, at least what I found, is
they're often virtual ghost towns. There's

00:19:08.379 --> 00:19:13.489
just nobody there as far as I can
tell. And again, it's not because it's a bad

00:19:13.489 --> 00:19:17.509
idea, a priori. Often they've been
well done, well executed, but people don't

00:19:17.509 --> 00:19:29.060
want to use them. Okay. So let me
just get a drink. What's going on here? As

00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:32.220
I said, that's just two of many
examples. I'm going to move away from the

00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.739
slides for a second here. So what's
going on is kind of obvious. But it bears

00:19:37.739 --> 00:19:44.390
being spelling out. Particularly if
you're a young scientist, although there's

00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.610
variations on this that's true for
all scientists. Particularly if you're a young

00:19:47.610 --> 00:19:53.989
scientist, you want to get a job
doing what you love. And you know what that

00:19:53.989 --> 00:19:59.659
entails. It entails working 60, 70,
80 hours a week working towards the kind of

00:19:59.659 --> 00:20:03.020
things that are going to get you
such a job. And this does not entail making

00:20:03.020 --> 00:20:06.820
contributions to the Qwiki
. If you have to trade off spending two or

00:20:06.820 --> 00:20:12.370
three hundred hours writing one or
two really mediocre scientific papers that

00:20:12.370 --> 00:20:16.389
nobody's ever going to read versus
spending the same time making a long slew

00:20:16.389 --> 00:20:22.350
of brilliant contributions to the Qwiki
or scientific social network, you know, whatever.

00:20:22.350 --> 00:20:27.820
Like, there's no comparison from the point
of view of your tenure committee or of the

00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:33.729
grant agency. Clearly you should
spend your time on that mediocre scientific

00:20:33.729 --> 00:20:39.149
paper. So, you know, that's the
straightforward career calculus there. And

00:20:39.149 --> 00:20:46.970
it is certainly the case that, if
you -- you know, even if you believe wholeheartedly

00:20:46.970 --> 00:20:50.849
in the power of something
like the Qwiki If you believe that's the best

00:20:50.849 --> 00:20:57.049
invention since sliced bread,
it's still a very hard thing to ask to spend

00:20:57.049 --> 00:21:01.729
a whole lot of time on it. It's
kind of tantamount to career suicide. So that's

00:21:01.729 --> 00:21:07.349
a really strong incentive for
people to stay away from things like this.

00:21:07.349 --> 00:21:11.960
I'm talking about what are the
reward structures. What types of contribution

00:21:11.960 --> 00:21:16.049
are going to be rewarded? Is it
simply writing papers and getting grants?

00:21:16.049 --> 00:21:20.789
Or will the scientific community
value other types of contribution as well.

00:21:20.789 --> 00:21:26.299
So what are the incentives there for?
What are the rewards there for? So I'm going

00:21:26.299 --> 00:21:29.169
to talk a little bit about
changing the culture so people start taking

00:21:29.169 --> 00:21:33.539
seriously the idea of using some of
these tools so they're incentivized and rewarded.

00:21:33.539 --> 00:21:38.940
But first I want to address a
little side issue. You might say how does

00:21:38.940 --> 00:21:41.820
something like Innocentive or the Polymath
Project

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:46.570
fit into this story? Well, actually it fits
in just right. If you look at

00:21:46.570 --> 00:21:50.229
something like the Polymath Project, yes,
it's certainly an unconventional

00:21:50.229 --> 00:21:55.169
means which is being used, but at the end
of the day, they've written scientific papers.

00:21:55.169 --> 00:22:00.269
That's the output. So it's an unconventional
means to a conventional end. So

00:22:00.269 --> 00:22:04.799
in that sense it's a conservative project.
When you contrast it with something

00:22:04.799 --> 00:22:11.009
like the quickie Qwiki, it's not building
towards a paper in any sense. You are simply

00:22:11.009 --> 00:22:17.549
contributing to it for its own sake. And Innocentive,
there's an even more

00:22:17.549 --> 00:22:24.320
basic motivation. You're looking for a cash
prize. Really direct version. Okay.

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:28.250
So I want to talk about two cases where in
fact the culture has changed in

00:22:28.250 --> 00:22:34.710
really significant ways. So the first example
concerns the Human Genome Project.

00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:40.399
So, actually does anybody here have a background
doing sort of genetics

00:22:40.399 --> 00:22:45.570
sequencing? So, you're familiar with the Bermuda
principles, that kind of thing? The Bermuda

00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:52.429
Principles? It's kind of ancient
history at some level now. If you go back

00:22:52.429 --> 00:22:57.049
to the early 1990s, it becomes very
clear -- or it's very clear certainly to people

00:22:57.049 --> 00:23:03.950
doing genome sequencing that the
human genome is going to be sequenced sooner

00:23:03.950 --> 00:23:08.779
rather than later. It's just a
matter of time at this point. But if you look

00:23:08.779 --> 00:23:12.509
at online databases like GenBank
where you can up load the data. There's a

00:23:12.509 --> 00:23:15.979
real question about why would a
scientist actually choose to up load their

00:23:15.979 --> 00:23:19.599
data to such a database? At some
level it's kind of like contributing to a

00:23:19.599 --> 00:23:25.229
site like Qwiki. It's not something, necessarily,
at this point in time that your tenure committee

00:23:25.229 --> 00:23:31.600
is going to care. It's not a
paper. You're simply helping your competitors.

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.149
This is very clear to
everybody who's involved that there's not

00:23:37.149 --> 00:23:41.539
a whole lot of incentive to do this
data sharing. But nonetheless, it's clearly

00:23:41.539 --> 00:23:44.730
in the community's best collective
interest -- certainly in humanity's collective

00:23:44.730 --> 00:23:49.919
interest. There's a meeting in
Bermuda in 1996 convened by the Welcome Trust.

00:23:49.919 --> 00:23:54.519
And amongst the people present
were the leaders of the Human Genome Project.

00:23:54.519 --> 00:23:56.529
Craig Venter, who would later lead the private
effort to

00:23:56.529 --> 00:23:59.960
sequence the genome, was present. Representatives
from the

00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:05.750
Welcome Trust were there and representatives
from the US NIH were there. So

00:24:05.750 --> 00:24:10.789
they sat and talked about this problem for
several days. Basically what people

00:24:10.789 --> 00:24:17.710
were willing to agree was that yes, they wanted
people to share the data, but they

00:24:17.710 --> 00:24:21.969
weren't willing to unilaterally go first and
themselves and do it. So they wrote

00:24:21.969 --> 00:24:26.509
what are now called the Bermuda Principles.
Which they basically stated two

00:24:26.509 --> 00:24:31.039
things. One was if you took more than a thousand
pairs of data, that that data should be

00:24:31.039 --> 00:24:35.909
up loaded to GenBank or a similar site within
24 hours. And second, that the

00:24:35.909 --> 00:24:40.919
data would be put into the public domain.
And it wasn't just an empty agreement.

00:24:40.919 --> 00:24:44.940
What happened was actually the representatives
from the NIH and the Welcome Trust went back

00:24:44.940 --> 00:24:47.759
to
the grant agencies and within 12 months they

00:24:47.759 --> 00:24:52.629
were baked into policy at the grant
agencies. Which meant if you wanted to get

00:24:52.629 --> 00:24:56.919
money to work on this, you needed to
agree to abide by the Bermuda Principles.

00:24:56.919 --> 00:25:02.799
So it's a great way of providing a
collective change in the behavior of that

00:25:02.799 --> 00:25:05.700
community. There's actually a lot more that's
happened

00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:11.330
since then to ensure that human genetic data
is broadly shared. There have been several

00:25:11.330 --> 00:25:15.570
follow up policies from
several major grant agencies. Another notable

00:25:15.570 --> 00:25:20.049
thing that happened was in April
of 2000, Clinton and Blair issued a joint

00:25:20.049 --> 00:25:24.679
statement essentially praising the
Bermuda Principles. They don't actually name

00:25:24.679 --> 00:25:28.409
them but they describe them
broadly urging every single country in the

00:25:28.409 --> 00:25:33.769
world adopt similar principles. this is a
nice story but of course human genetic data

00:25:33.769 --> 00:25:38.429
is this tiny fraction of all human scientific
knowledge. Even if

00:25:38.429 --> 00:25:44.330
you just look at other types of genetic data,
the situation is much more patchy. A biologist

00:25:44.330 --> 00:25:50.399
of my acquaintance who's
done a lot of open source work. He approached

00:25:50.399 --> 00:25:55.710
me after a talk and his comment
was that he'd been sitting on a genome for

00:25:55.710 --> 00:26:01.779
an entire species for more than a
year. So that's a whole species of life whose

00:26:01.779 --> 00:26:06.659
genome is undergoing bit rot on
his hard disk somewhere purely because his

00:26:06.659 --> 00:26:12.509
collaborators haven't gotten around
to running the appropriate analyses. And of

00:26:12.509 --> 00:26:16.810
course, there's lots more knowledge
of that kind broadly across science. When

00:26:16.810 --> 00:26:23.070
I give talks, sometimes I will ask at
the start, "How many people -- to scientists

00:26:23.070 --> 00:26:26.950
-- how many people systemically
share their data." Not how many people will

00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:31.279
respond to an e-mail request to
share scientific data or whatnot. But how

00:26:31.279 --> 00:26:36.739
many people systemically share it.
And except in a couple of fields, invariably

00:26:36.739 --> 00:26:40.320
two or three people in the audience
will raise their hands or sometimes none.

00:26:40.320 --> 00:26:48.279
So very small fraction. And more
broadly, in most parts of science, not just

00:26:48.279 --> 00:26:53.190
data, but also co-chairing of the
situation is all over the map but it's not

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:56.899
particularly good. And then there's
a whole lot of other knowledge. All sorts

00:26:56.899 --> 00:27:02.629
of tacit knowledge. People's half-
baked ideas, questions and the observations

00:27:02.629 --> 00:27:05.779
that are either raw input. Oftentimes the
most

00:27:05.779 --> 00:27:11.239
important raw input in scientific papers remain
locked up inside people's heads in laboratories

00:27:11.239 --> 00:27:14.830
And are not actually being shared broadly
where they can be used by other people

00:27:14.830 --> 00:27:20.360
and built on in the manner that we saw in
the case of PolyMath Project. So I told

00:27:20.360 --> 00:27:24.960
you I described two stories of a cultural
shift towards a more open scientific

00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:28.729
culture. The second story is much bigger than
the human genome project. But I

00:27:28.729 --> 00:27:36.580
have to go back all the way to the dawn of
modern science. So I go back to 1609.

00:27:36.580 --> 00:27:43.610
It's December. Galileo has built his first
astronomical telescope. Seven months

00:27:43.610 --> 00:27:47.700
pass. For whatever reason he doesn't look
at Saturn during that time, as far as we know.

00:27:47.700 --> 00:27:53.210
But on the morning of July 25,
1610. He points his telescope at Saturn for

00:27:53.210 --> 00:27:59.379
the first time. And what he's
expecting to see is a little disk; that's

00:27:59.379 --> 00:28:03.049
what he's seen when he's looked at other planets.
But what he sees isn't a little disk. It's

00:28:03.049 --> 00:28:09.279
a little disk and it's
got two noticeable bumps on either side. And

00:28:09.279 --> 00:28:15.320
what he's seeing is of course the
first hint of the rings of Saturn. His telescope

00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:20.029
actually doesn't -- it's not quite good
enough to resolve the rings. That would have

00:28:20.029 --> 00:28:22.820
to wait till Christiaan Huygans some years
later.

00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:27.190
But he knows straight away this is a monumental
discovery. It's kind of hard to

00:28:27.190 --> 00:28:32.099
think, at this point, how can that be a big
discovery? But, of course, our

00:28:32.099 --> 00:28:37.159
knowledge of the heavens had barely changed
since prehistoric times at this

00:28:37.159 --> 00:28:43.620
point. So it really was a big thing to have
learned. Does he announce this to the world?

00:28:43.620 --> 00:28:47.269
No.
What he does is, he writes down a description

00:28:47.269 --> 00:28:52.960
of the discovery in his notes.
And then, he scrambles the letters into an

00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:58.489
anagram. And he mails that anagram
off to four of his astronomer colleagues.

00:28:58.489 --> 00:29:03.759
Straight away within a day, including Keplar,
as one of the people.

00:29:03.759 --> 00:29:09.239
And what he's ensuring is that if Keplar later
makes the same discovery, Galileo

00:29:09.239 --> 00:29:14.639
can later reveal the anagram and claim the
credit. But in the meantime, he

00:29:14.639 --> 00:29:20.499
hasn't disclosed anything at all. And of course,
it's not just that Galileo was

00:29:20.499 --> 00:29:25.380
a bad guy or whatnot, but this was common
at the time. Leonardo did it.

00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:31.789
Galileo did it. Huygens did it. Newton did
it. Robert Hooke revealed Hooke's Law in this

00:29:31.789 --> 00:29:38.289
way, which you may remember from high school.
There was no incentive at the time to share

00:29:38.289 --> 00:29:43.539
information. And so, people kept it
secret as long as they could. Or the incentives

00:29:43.539 --> 00:29:46.589
were certainly much less clear
than they are today. At least today it's in

00:29:46.589 --> 00:29:51.389
your best interest to publish a
paper. So the standard kind of scientist way

00:29:51.389 --> 00:29:57.700
of solved that in 1665 with the
invention of the scientific paper. But actually

00:29:57.700 --> 00:30:00.559
the story is much more
complicated than that. In fact, the editors

00:30:00.559 --> 00:30:04.759
of the first scientific journals
had tremendous difficulty in convincing people

00:30:04.759 --> 00:30:12.820
to reveal information. It took many
decades. So here's -- this is a -- basically

00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:18.979
Marie Boas Hall she was the biographer of
Henry Oldenburg who was the first editor of

00:30:18.979 --> 00:30:22.320
the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal
Society. She describes how Oldenburg would

00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:25.100
"beg for information,"
sometimes writing simultaneously to two competing

00:30:25.100 --> 00:30:28.389
scientists on the grounds that it would be
"best to tell A what B was doing and vice

00:30:28.389 --> 00:30:33.289
versa, in the hope of stimulating both men
(it was men at the time) to more work and

00:30:33.289 --> 00:30:38.460
more openness". She had these nice examples.
Two people working on essentially the same

00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.239
problem and Oldenburg would kind of
bounce letters backwards and forwards sort

00:30:43.239 --> 00:30:49.450
of insinuating that the other one was ahead
of where they really were at in the hopes

00:30:49.450 --> 00:30:52.080
this person would then feel that they had
to say, "oh, I

00:30:52.080 --> 00:31:00.709
can do that too." Kind of, he would then publish
distillations of these correspondences

00:31:00.709 --> 00:31:07.479
in the Philosophical Transactions. Funny kind
of a way to be doing science.

00:31:07.479 --> 00:31:11.222
Another similar quote. This is Elizabeth Eisenstein
one of the scholars of the

00:31:11.222 --> 00:31:16.369
printing press. She's talking about late 1600's.
So exactly the same time

00:31:16.369 --> 00:31:20.119
period. She's talking about "Exploitation
of the mass medium [books] was more

00:31:20.119 --> 00:31:24.070
common among pseudoscientists and quacks than
among Latin-writing professional

00:31:24.070 --> 00:31:28.490
scientists, who often withheld their work
from the press." Well, this is 220

00:31:28.490 --> 00:31:33.489
years after Gutenberg, right? It's not next
week or next year or even

00:31:33.489 --> 00:31:38.969
next decade. In fact, it's not even next century.
It's 220 years. It's the

00:31:38.969 --> 00:31:44.960
time gap that separates us from the French
Revolution. And it really did take a

00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:49.399
major transition over many decades. So this
is an interesting question. What

00:31:49.399 --> 00:31:54.450
caused the transition? Well, the immediate
thing you can say is that what caused

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:59.969
the transition was somehow establishing a
link between publication in journals

00:31:59.969 --> 00:32:04.830
and career success. The link that academics
today take completely for granted

00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:10.380
as though it's somehow holy writ. It was a
social process that went on there.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:15.349
But this begs the question, you know, what
actually really caused it? What

00:32:15.349 --> 00:32:20.610
underlay this transition? How was that link
established? First of all I should

00:32:20.610 --> 00:32:24.139
say that the transition did take certainly
decades. Arguably longer than a

00:32:24.139 --> 00:32:30.529
century. It's sometimes called the open science
revolution. So to boil down –

00:32:30.529 --> 00:32:34.009
it's a very nice paper that's been written
by Paul David at Stanford about how

00:32:34.009 --> 00:32:39.470
this happened. To boil his 120-page paper
down to two words it's patron

00:32:39.470 --> 00:32:43.989
pressure. So to explain what I mean by that,
let me give you an example of

00:32:43.989 --> 00:32:48.451
patron pressure more or less in action. This
is my example, not David's, but I

00:32:48.451 --> 00:32:54.989
think it illustrates his point very well.
The rings of Saturn was not Galileo's

00:32:54.989 --> 00:33:00.851
first big discovery. Arguably it was the four
Galilean moons of Jupiter which I

00:33:00.851 --> 00:33:06.631
think was made in January of 1610. So what
happened? Well, you know, Galileo

00:33:06.631 --> 00:33:11.549
sees these moons. And actually he published
that discovery pretty quickly. Not

00:33:11.549 --> 00:33:19.019
at all similar to the story of Saturn, right?
He published a pamphlet. But

00:33:19.019 --> 00:33:23.049
before he established the pamphlet, first
of all he contacted several

00:33:23.049 --> 00:33:28.409
potentially rich patrons including the Medici
family and said, "I will name

00:33:28.409 --> 00:33:36.719
these moons after you publicly if you agree
to become my patrons." So here's

00:33:36.719 --> 00:33:42.299
Galileo's announcement. Notice anything about
what gets the most -- possibly

00:33:42.299 --> 00:33:49.429
there's two things. The title, "Sidereus Nuncius"
which apparently stands for "starry messenger".

00:33:49.429 --> 00:33:53.899
Galileo's own name is considerably smaller
than

00:33:53.899 --> 00:33:57.749
this announcement of the Medician moons. It's
too bad for Medici that we now

00:33:57.749 --> 00:34:05.039
call them the Galilean moons. They kind of
lost out there. But the point is that the

00:34:05.039 --> 00:34:11.950
funders have different incentives. In particular,
the funders have much more

00:34:11.950 --> 00:34:17.070
incentive for openness than the scientists
do. Medici want to -- they wanted the

00:34:17.070 --> 00:34:25.549
kudos that went with having this known for
them. And David's contention and I think

00:34:25.549 --> 00:34:29.960
he's basically correct is that in fact it
was this fact -- this pressure from

00:34:29.960 --> 00:34:35.010
the patrons -- that ultimately caused this
transition to the more open system

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:39.620
that we do have today. Now it's interesting
to think back to my genome story –

00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:44.310
the Bermuda Principle story. There's actually
a really strong parallel. The

00:34:44.310 --> 00:34:47.859
genome is open in part not because of patron
pressure, but funder pressure in

00:34:47.859 --> 00:34:53.299
part, essentially the same thing. It's not
just funder pressure. The scientists involved

00:34:53.299 --> 00:34:57.289
certainly work
together. But the ultimate governance mechanism

00:34:57.289 --> 00:35:01.069
was the fact that these people
had a lot of money and the ability to withhold

00:35:01.069 --> 00:35:06.210
it if people weren't willing to
share data in the greater good. So I would

00:35:06.210 --> 00:35:11.540
say certainly today that the grant
agencies, the NSF, NIH, and other large grant

00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:14.960
agencies, there's a lot of potential
for them to work towards a lot stronger open

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:22.089
data policies, than they currently have.
It's not just the human genome data they have

00:35:22.089 --> 00:35:26.071
policies for; they have a number of data types.
But there's a real

00:35:26.071 --> 00:35:31.359
possibility to greatly broaden those policies
and also to encourage people to

00:35:31.359 --> 00:35:36.150
share data much earlier in the discovery process.
In a similar kind of a

00:35:36.150 --> 00:35:40.150
fashion of course there's a lot of valuable
scientific information tied up in

00:35:40.150 --> 00:35:45.110
code which is siting on hard disks inside
laboratories and grant agencies could

00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:49.890
potentially work towards open code policies
particularly for critical parts of

00:35:49.890 --> 00:35:55.590
analyses. Anything critical to the analysis.
Another thing which grant agencies

00:35:55.590 --> 00:36:00.060
could do today potentially is they could start
to legitimize tools simply by

00:36:00.060 --> 00:36:06.240
encouraging scientists to submit nonstandard
evidence of impact. For example writing a

00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.630
job
description -- actually I'm switching from

00:36:07.630 --> 00:36:11.530
grant agencies to an academic. If you
write job applications and you just add one

00:36:11.530 --> 00:36:15.570
line that encourages people to submit
nonstandard evidence of impact bits. That

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:21.700
will have a tremendous amount of impact. So
that, you

00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:25.740
know, switching back to the grant agencies
again. It should be possible to use

00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:32.380
contributions to sites like Qwiki or uploads
to github as evidence of impact. I

00:36:32.380 --> 00:36:35.920
would go so far as to say I certainly believe
that in fact publicly funded

00:36:35.920 --> 00:36:41.359
science should really be open science. Now,
there's a lot of caveats to this

00:36:41.359 --> 00:36:45.309
statement. Just a couple. There certainly
need to be exceptions for

00:36:45.309 --> 00:36:50.029
confidential and proprietary knowledge. But
as a broad, general sense, we could

00:36:50.029 --> 00:36:54.440
certainly work towards a world in which publicly
funded science is open science.

00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:02.140
You know, there's a tremendous amount of room
there for people to move. And

00:37:02.140 --> 00:37:05.980
we're only moving very slowly in that direction.
The reason I wrote this book

00:37:05.980 --> 00:37:12.119
is at least in part to make open science a
public issue. And that I believe

00:37:12.119 --> 00:37:16.150
will serve two ends. One is to help encourage
the scientific community

00:37:16.150 --> 00:37:20.240
internally to have a serious discussion about
what types of contributions it

00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:23.740
values. Why is it the case that uploading
scientific data to online

00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:29.040
database is something, in most fields, not
presently seen as part of people's job. That

00:37:29.040 --> 00:37:32.300
kind of
question. But at the same time it's also possible

00:37:32.300 --> 00:37:35.619
to have a public discussion
of what type of scientific culture we want

00:37:35.619 --> 00:37:40.140
to support by public money. At the end of
the day, the public is paying by definition

00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:45.549
for publicly funded science, so they
should have some sort of impact. Just a couple

00:37:45.549 --> 00:37:52.510
of remarks about my own personal
experience and what sorts of things I found

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:57.940
useful to do as a working scientist.
These are -- they're all very small steps

00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:03.460
I should say, but I feel like these
are things which many people could do. I certainly

00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:09.039
have made a point through my
career -- it's maybe not so unusual as a physicist

00:38:09.039 --> 00:38:13.660
to make sure that my papers
are freely available online. So about 80 percent

00:38:13.660 --> 00:38:18.849
or so of my scientific output
is available freely online in some form or

00:38:18.849 --> 00:38:23.770
another. A little bit more
adventurously -- I've certainly explored using

00:38:23.770 --> 00:38:30.310
my blog as a way of conducting
not just sort of science outreach or high-level

00:38:30.310 --> 00:38:35.430
discussions but in some cases
very detailed technical discussions at sort

00:38:35.430 --> 00:38:41.041
of a research level entirely in the
open. With mixed success. I mean, something

00:38:41.041 --> 00:38:48.619
that continues to amaze me –
several posts -- a very technical level -- things

00:38:48.619 --> 00:38:52.880
like this series of posts on
the Fermionic and the Jordan Wigner Transform

00:38:52.880 --> 00:38:56.510
which have tens of thousands of downloads.
I'm not quite

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:01.420
sure who's reading it, but there's apparently
a market somewhat to my surprise.

00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:06.160
A little bit less successfully or something
I recently started doing that hasn't

00:39:06.160 --> 00:39:10.650
been all that successful is uploading sometimes
-- so for example, this is the

00:39:10.650 --> 00:39:17.500
version of this series of posts which I've
up loaded to git hub so people could

00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:21.970
potentially contribute polar requests and
[inaudible]. And so on. There's been a bit

00:39:21.970 --> 00:39:25.420
of interest but
not a huge amount of doing that at this point.

00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:33.740
I'm also involved in a very
minor way with Polymath Project hosting the

00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:42.220
Polymath Wiki. We're probably in
some sense my largest single open research

00:39:42.220 --> 00:39:45.790
project -- it's not exactly open
science -- was in fact construction of my

00:39:45.790 --> 00:39:54.580
book over a period of four years. So
using GitHub to bookmark all of my -- all

00:39:54.580 --> 00:40:02.410
of the research which I did for it.
Which is then piped through to friend feed.

00:40:02.410 --> 00:40:08.740
Which enables discussion around
that. And so, if you look in the background

00:40:08.740 --> 00:40:12.190
to my book, there's actually
thousands of discussions with hundreds of

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:19.950
people there all done in a sort of
super lightweight sort of a way. Totally transformed

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:25.289
my experience certainly of
writing. It was very useful. And parts of

00:40:25.289 --> 00:40:29.339
the book were also written in the
open in so far as my publisher was willing

00:40:29.339 --> 00:40:35.609
and able to allow that. Looking much
more broadly at some of the organizations

00:40:35.609 --> 00:40:39.869
which are involved in doing open
science work, one organization which has done

00:40:39.869 --> 00:40:45.529
really tremendous work and is
almost unknown is the Alliance for Taxpayer

00:40:45.529 --> 00:40:49.609
Access. So this is an organization
which has done a lot of work lobbying, particularly

00:40:49.609 --> 00:40:54.710
in the United States for
open access policies and open data policies.

00:40:54.710 --> 00:40:58.230
At the moment they're trying to
get the Federal Public Research Act passed.

00:40:58.230 --> 00:41:03.650
What this will mean -- if you receive
funding to do scientific research from a U.S.

00:41:03.650 --> 00:41:07.820
agency with a budget of more than
100 million dollars a year then within 12

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:13.859
months of publishing your results it will
need to be openly available online. If that

00:41:13.859 --> 00:41:18.619
act is passed, that will be a big
deal. The Alliance For Taxpayer Access played

00:41:18.619 --> 00:41:24.369
a major role in lobbying for a
precursor policy, the NIH open access policy

00:41:24.369 --> 00:41:26.880
which does the same thing for NIH funded research.
So

00:41:26.880 --> 00:41:30.259
over the next few years. In fact, in Google
search results, when you search for

00:41:30.259 --> 00:41:34.710
biomedical things, you'll start to see a lot
more papers. And that's really an

00:41:34.710 --> 00:41:38.619
outcome of lobbying done by them and other
organizations. So I think that's a

00:41:38.619 --> 00:41:42.559
tremendous thing. Creative Commons which many
of you will know but not

00:41:42.559 --> 00:41:46.980
necessarily for their scientific work have
also done similarly lobbying work.

00:41:46.980 --> 00:41:51.820
And they've also worked in particular with
a number of companies to urge them to

00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:57.089
share pretty competitive data and have had
some major releases and done a lot of good

00:41:57.089 --> 00:42:00.300
work. And there are dozens of other companies
and organizations; I just

00:42:00.300 --> 00:42:07.940
mentioned a few here,. in case people are
interested. And I'm very happy to

00:42:07.940 --> 00:42:13.890
chat afterwards in more detail. Just one final
note. Something I would love to

00:42:13.890 --> 00:42:17.890
see, which is something which I think Google
could reasonably easily do is in

00:42:17.890 --> 00:42:22.140
fact if Google scholar -- it's just an idea.
I don't know how feasible it is.

00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:27.360
So many decisions are made in terms of hiring
-- you know, I've sat in hiring

00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:31.119
meetings where people have sat in meetings
searching through Google scholar for

00:42:31.119 --> 00:42:36.900
people's citation records and so on. There
are some non-traditional forms of

00:42:36.900 --> 00:42:43.980
contribution which show up in scholar results.
I guess within physics,

00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:50.069
Preprints tends to be the one that does show
up in Google scholar results. But

00:42:50.069 --> 00:42:54.339
there's the potential I think to start to
include more non-traditional forms of

00:42:54.339 --> 00:43:00.009
contribution. I've seen a few blog posts show
up in Google scholar results. It

00:43:00.009 --> 00:43:04.519
certainly would be more interesting if that
was done more systemically and

00:43:04.519 --> 00:43:07.529
potentially start a conversation within the
scientific community about how

00:43:07.529 --> 00:43:12.730
seriously those kinds of contributions should
be taken. Anyway, it's just a

00:43:12.730 --> 00:43:16.549
suggestion. I'd certainly be happy to chat
about it more and thank you all very

00:43:16.549 --> 00:43:18.849
much for your attention.

00:43:18.849 --> 00:43:19.569
[Applause]
