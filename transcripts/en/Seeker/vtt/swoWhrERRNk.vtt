00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.740
This was one of those episodes where we've
wanted to talk about it for a long time, and

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:06.230
people are surprised we've never covered it
before.

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:08.000
So, welcome to the future.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:15.400
Let's explain abortion.

00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:21.269
A new study in PlosOne says 99% of women who
received induced abortions believed it was

00:00:21.269 --> 00:00:23.630
the right decision, even years later.

00:00:23.630 --> 00:00:27.550
But even with the near-constant prattle on
the subject of abortions in the United States,

00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:31.640
many people are completely unaware of what
the procedure entails.

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:32.970
Well, no longer.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:37.020
Firstly, the term abortion, is actually an
umbrella term for a number of different medical

00:00:37.020 --> 00:00:41.230
procedures resulting in the termination of
a pregnancy in the first 28 weeks.

00:00:41.230 --> 00:00:45.030
Therapeutic abortion is when a pregnancy is
terminated to save the life of the mother,

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:49.090
and elective abortion is when someone chooses
to terminate for another reason.

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:51.150
Abortions can happen naturally too!

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.910
These 'spontaneous abortions' are commonly
called a miscarriage.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:58.670
There are two categories of abortion, Medical
(or Clinical) and Surgical.

00:00:58.670 --> 00:01:02.950
Medical uses a drug to terminate the pregnancy,
and surgical involves physically clearing

00:01:02.950 --> 00:01:03.950
the uterus.

00:01:03.950 --> 00:01:09.040
The most common type of abortion in the US
is the surgical procedure Suction Curettage.

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:12.750
It's commonly used in the first 12 weeks of
pregnancy (the first trimester).

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:17.440
It involves numbing and dilating the cervix,
the opening into the uterus, and inserting

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.260
a pencil-sized plastic tube.

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:23.470
The tube is attached to a suction device,
and once in place, the fetus (or embyro if

00:01:23.470 --> 00:01:27.720
it's earlier than 8 weeks), placenta and other
uterine contents are evacuated.

00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.820
Occasionally, the doctor must brush the inside
wall of the uterus to ensure it's clear; the

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:35.159
whole procedure takes 10 to 15 minutes and
is 100 percent effective.

00:01:35.159 --> 00:01:40.500
Afterward, many doctors prescribe painkillers,
as they'll experience pain similar to menstrual

00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:41.500
cramping.

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:47.049
After 16 weeks (and up to viability) a different
procedure is done called D&amp;E or dilation and

00:01:47.049 --> 00:01:48.049
evacuation.

00:01:48.049 --> 00:01:51.560
It's different because the cervix must be
dilated slightly wider to accommodate the

00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:52.630
larger mass.

00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:56.470
As this is the second trimester, the fetus
ranges from six to twelve inches, depending

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.330
on the number of weeks pregnant.

00:01:58.330 --> 00:02:02.350
Once the cervix is dilated, the doctor uses
forceps and a light suction device to remove

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.020
the fetus, placental tissue and uterine contents.

00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:09.019
A study in the American Journal of Obstetrics
and Gynecology found more than 90 percent

00:02:09.019 --> 00:02:13.260
of women who have had surgical abortions would
recommend it to a friend, but 40 percent of

00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:17.400
patients would opt for a medical abortion
if a future procedure was required.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.471
Medical abortions are non-invasive and use
drugs like mifepristone and misoprostol, to

00:02:21.471 --> 00:02:24.670
block the activity of progesterone in the
human body.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:29.319
Without progesterone, the lining of the uterus
thins until the cells inside are evacuated

00:02:29.319 --> 00:02:31.739
naturally, similar to a natural miscarriage.

00:02:31.739 --> 00:02:35.650
Bleeding usually occurs for a week and a half
to a month after taking the drugs, and it's

00:02:35.650 --> 00:02:37.519
97 percent effective.

00:02:37.519 --> 00:02:42.319
Medical abortions are simple procedures, but
are only used in the first 49 days of a pregnancy.

00:02:42.319 --> 00:02:46.029
The drug is also used to induce labor, and
as an emergency contraceptive.

00:02:46.029 --> 00:02:51.739
In 1973 the United States Supreme Court ruled,
in a landmark decision, women's choice of

00:02:51.739 --> 00:02:55.760
abortion falls under the right of privacy
under the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution.

00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.609
If the fetus can live outside the womb, even
with medical assistance, however, then it

00:02:59.609 --> 00:03:04.580
is considered viable and elective abortion
is not usually protected under the law.

00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:09.940
Viability ranges from pregnancy to pregnancy,
but is usually from 22 to 24 weeks into a

00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:10.940
pregnancy.

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.359
These abortion procedures don't involve body
parts, surgery or the horrible pictures pro-life

00:03:14.359 --> 00:03:16.180
activists put on their signs.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:20.550
The American College of Obstetricians and
Gynecologists point out abortions have few

00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.069
side effects or risks for the women.

00:03:23.069 --> 00:03:27.129
Medical abortions will sometimes not be complete,
and will require a follow-up visit, but there's

00:03:27.129 --> 00:03:31.819
no increased risk for breast cancers, or future
pregnancy complications; and no change in

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:32.819
fertility.

00:03:32.819 --> 00:03:36.540
Interestingly, "For women with an unplanned
pregnancy, there is no difference in risk

00:03:36.540 --> 00:03:41.109
of depression or other mental health problems
between those who have an abortion and those

00:03:41.109 --> 00:03:42.519
who have the baby."

00:03:42.519 --> 00:03:47.981
The first recorded abortion was in 1550 BCE,
and was recorded on the Ebers Papyrus, medical

00:03:47.981 --> 00:03:50.579
scrolls used by ancient Egyptians.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.510
Ancient Chinese have documentation of it as
well, and the Christian Church even allowed

00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:58.579
elective abortions until the mother could
feel the fetus moving which is called the

00:03:58.579 --> 00:04:01.709
quickening; though that changed in the 18th
and 19th centuries.

00:04:01.709 --> 00:04:05.409
Making these procedures illegal doesn't halt
them being performed either.

00:04:05.409 --> 00:04:09.870
In Nigeria, where elective abortion is illegal,
fully half as many abortions are performed

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:15.159
as in the US with a much lower population,
but 60 percent of those are done by untrained

00:04:15.159 --> 00:04:19.859
non-physicians, risking the life and health
of the women seeking the procedures.

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:25.640
In the end, the study from PLOSone also found
as time goes by, any positive and negative

00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:31.409
feelings around the procedure fade, though
again, 99 percent are happy with their decision..

00:04:31.409 --> 00:04:36.000
Over time, all memories lose their sharp edge,
and it's no different with something as contentious

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.289
as induced abortion.

00:04:37.289 --> 00:04:39.260
You're going to comment, maybe you have already.

00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:42.160
I hope you watched this whole video, and I
hope you learned something.

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.460
I'll be down in the comments for a while,
so let me know what you think and thank you

00:04:45.460 --> 00:04:48.939
so much for watching DNews.
