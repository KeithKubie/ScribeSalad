00:00:00.559 --> 00:00:05.300
Our own clumsiness can feel like one of the most shameful things about us.

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:07.600
On returning a carton to the fridge,

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:12.399
we trip and spill orange juice down our whole front. It goes into our shoes, too.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:16.060
Even the inside lining of the soles are soaked in orange pulp.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:23.020
It's a good ten minutes and a few towels before we've changed out of all our clothes - even our underwear - and cleaned ourselves up.

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.100
We feel three and a half years old.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:29.200
When are we gonna grow up into the adults we supposedly are?

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:35.100
If only this were the only such incident, but clumsiness may stalk us everywhere.

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:40.450
A month ago we badly bruised our knee against a door, then we spilled blueberries over the kitchen floor,

00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.330
and recently we went around for a whole day not noticing

00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:45.380
there was a piece of lettuce coating one of our teeth.

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.950
We're furious with, and ashamed of ourselves.

00:00:49.100 --> 00:00:53.259
Our clumsiness violates our self-image as competent grownups.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.429
There's a Yiddish word that artfully evokes the extent of our stupidity.

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:03.639
The clumsy person is in Yiddish a klutz, a dunderhead, a blockhead, a fool

00:01:03.979 --> 00:01:10.089
It's the inner klutz who makes us drop plates, who walks into doors and who didn't remember to do up its flies.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:18.000
It's normal to hate our klutz and with a grim face to try to deny it's even really there inside us.

00:01:18.100 --> 00:01:24.069
Instead, we strive to hold on to our dignity and when we can presume that the klutz has gone away for good.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:27.489
When we do meet with it, it's always with some horror,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:33.729
agitation and humiliation - we thought we'd left the Klutz behind, somewhere in childhood.

00:01:33.799 --> 00:01:40.779
But no, it's still here, getting us to drop our phone in the toilet bowl and forget an important person's name at a party.

00:01:41.330 --> 00:01:47.769
But there would be another less explored option: to make friends with our inner Klutz

00:01:48.229 --> 00:01:53.259
Not to keep denying that it really exists, but to face up to it head-on, in good time.

00:01:53.479 --> 00:01:58.149
We should accept without rancor or fury that we simply are at one level

00:01:58.340 --> 00:02:03.400
Klutzes who knock things over, spill drinks and make fools of ourselves in small and large ways.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:11.500
This is only a humiliation if we insist that the only way to be acceptable is to exhibit constant competence.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:18.200
Once we accept that we are klutzes through and through, one more spilled drink won't need to discomfort us much further.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:24.839
What particularly humiliates us at moments of clumsiness is the impression that we're all alone with our ineptness.

00:02:25.270 --> 00:02:28.650
We wouldn't mind being clumsy if everyone was clumsy, too.

00:02:28.810 --> 00:02:34.590
But they don't seem to be. We appear to have been singled out as the greatest klutzes we've ever met!

00:02:35.140 --> 00:02:36.360
Far from it.

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:43.529
We simply don't see the clumsiness of other people as we do our own, because it happens in private and is

00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:46.050
carefully edited out of public life.

00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:55.000
It's not surprising that in comedy shows there is such a widespread appetite for watching people fall off their bikes or walk into lampposts.

00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:59.400
We feel so relieved by evidence that clumsiness is not ours alone.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:05.730
It may look as if we're mocking but really we're delighted to have found people as absurd as we are.

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:13.559
The comedy show invites us to see our own clumsiness as part of a collective foolishness, not a private tragedy.

00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:18.899
We can also see that our own clumsiness is not what sets us apart from others,

00:03:19.030 --> 00:03:22.830
but actually what we share in secret with everyone

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:32.000
We can accommodate our idiocy more sweetly inside ourselves by trusting at last that it is entirely normal and universal

00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:36.000
to be clumsy, that it's a factor to be understood and forgiven in ourselves

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:40.000
because it should be understood and forgiven in everyone.

00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:42.370
The next time we spill something down our front,

00:03:42.370 --> 00:03:45.000
we shouldn't feel a hot prickly rage.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:50.399
We should greet our inner klutz like an old familiar friend with a warm,

00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:53.100
tolerant smile of recognition.

00:03:54.790 --> 00:04:00.809
