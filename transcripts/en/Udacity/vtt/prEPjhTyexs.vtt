00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Let's test our knowledge of using shifting

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
to fill out the parse table: the chart.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Let's say that this is our grammar:

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
P reduces to or can be rewritten as:

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
open parenthesis P, closed parenthesis.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
or P can just disappear.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Sometimes we write the epsilon and sometimes we don't--whatever we'd prefer.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
So chart state[0] includes the following parse states:

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
(P goes to: here's right where I am, open P, close)

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
or (P goes to: here's where I am and then there's nothing more),

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
both coming from state[0].

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.000
What I'd like you to tell me is:

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
What are we going to put in chart[1] if the input is ( )

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.000
because of shifting?

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.000
What's shifting going to add to our parsing chart?

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.000
In this multiple choice quiz--actually, there's only 1 right answer.

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Which one is it?
