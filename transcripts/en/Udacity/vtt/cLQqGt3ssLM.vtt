00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:04.970
I feel that no aspect of MU2
is more interesting, and

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:08.840
potentially more impactful to
the management of chronic disease,

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:14.120
than the requirement that more than
5% of all unique patients seen

00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:19.680
by an eligible provider during
each reporting period either View,

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.870
Download or Transmit to a third party
their digital health information.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:31.360
This is referred to as VDT, and
ONC has related specific guidance,

00:00:31.360 --> 00:00:35.500
as shown here, as to what electronic
patient summaries should be

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:39.660
made available to patients
under various care scenarios.

00:00:39.660 --> 00:00:43.210
The first one listed here
is Transitions of Care.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:47.410
This is, for example, when a patient
goes from a hospital to a nursing home

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:51.140
or back to their home from
either of those facilities.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:55.190
Errors often occur at transition
points because information is not

00:00:55.190 --> 00:00:58.730
passed on completely and accurately.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:02.170
In lesson five,
we'll look in detail at the electronic

00:01:02.170 --> 00:01:05.990
clinical summary specified
at transitions of care.

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:09.530
But you may wonder why providers
are measuring activities

00:01:09.530 --> 00:01:12.040
usually done by their patients.

00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:15.945
Research shows that patients are far
more likely to embrace electronic

00:01:15.945 --> 00:01:19.830
self-care tools if their provider
encourages them to do it.

00:01:19.830 --> 00:01:22.750
And even provide some
help in getting there.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.290
As a result of VDT, many more
provider practices will be offering

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:32.540
encouragement and even the needed
tools integrated with their EHR.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:36.100
We'll return to this and
to VDT in lesson seven,

00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:39.130
when we discuss these
patient facing tools.

00:01:39.130 --> 00:01:40.800
Later, you'll also obtain and

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.990
use Marla's clinical
summary in some activities.

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:50.040
Which of the following is a key new
goal of Stage 2 of Meaningful Use?
