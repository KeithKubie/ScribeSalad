00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:02.467
NARRATOR: Obama needs
just two Republican

00:00:02.467 --> 00:00:06.467
senators to defy their party.

00:00:06.467 --> 00:00:09.500
He turns to the veteran leader
of the Senate Democrats.

00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:14.533
None of the Republicans who
wanted to do something to help

00:00:14.533 --> 00:00:16.133
wanted to be the 60th vote.

00:00:16.133 --> 00:00:19.066
So I had to get 61
votes on everything.

00:00:19.066 --> 00:00:20.834
And it was very hard.

00:00:20.834 --> 00:00:23.967
The only ones I had any
hope of getting-- Specter

00:00:23.967 --> 00:00:26.500
from Pennsylvania,
and then I had

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:29.700
the two senators from Maine.

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:31.700
NARRATOR: Maine
Senator Susan Collins,

00:00:31.700 --> 00:00:34.533
a Republican Reid
identifies as vulnerable,

00:00:34.533 --> 00:00:36.967
is invited to the Oval Office.

00:00:36.967 --> 00:00:38.867
SUSAN COLLINS (VOICEOVER):
I was shocked when I walked

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:42.567
in expecting to see
the economic advisers,

00:00:42.567 --> 00:00:47.367
other staff taking
notes, and instead, it

00:00:47.367 --> 00:00:50.700
was just the President and me.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:53.133
I told him I thought
the package was too big.

00:00:53.133 --> 00:00:56.600
He told me that his economists
were telling him that a smaller

00:00:56.600 --> 00:00:59.600
package would not do
the trick and would not

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:01.767
boost the economy sufficiently.

00:01:05.066 --> 00:01:06.633
NARRATOR: Senator
Collins agrees to meet

00:01:06.633 --> 00:01:09.567
behind closed doors with a
group of 17 other senators.

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:15.533
When senators from
both parties meet

00:01:15.533 --> 00:01:20.834
outside the control of the
leadership, it's called a gang.

00:01:20.834 --> 00:01:24.767
This gang of 18 came together
with the primary focus

00:01:24.767 --> 00:01:31.567
of wanting to reduce the cost
by at least $100 billion.

00:01:31.567 --> 00:01:34.400
NARRATOR: Obama reluctantly
agrees to the cuts

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.233
because it looks as though
this will buy him the votes

00:01:36.233 --> 00:01:37.133
he needs.

00:01:39.333 --> 00:01:41.166
But the Republican
leadership leans

00:01:41.166 --> 00:01:45.533
hard on Republican
members of the gang of 18.

00:01:45.533 --> 00:01:47.633
SUSAN COLLINS (VOICEOVER):
Although we had a number

00:01:47.633 --> 00:01:52.567
of Republicans who joined those
first few meetings, gradually,

00:01:52.567 --> 00:01:55.300
the numbers diminished greatly.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:59.467
I didn't know if we
could get this done.

00:01:59.467 --> 00:02:00.767
And I told the President that.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:04.934
I had to wait till
his helicopter landed

00:02:04.934 --> 00:02:06.433
to give him the
bad news, saying,

00:02:06.433 --> 00:02:10.200
I'm not sure I
can get this done.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:12.900
I received this phone
call from Harry Reid

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300
to come over to his office.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:20.500
And I really debated
whether or not to go.

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:25.200
I went into the room, and
the room was already filled

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:27.300
with Democratic leadership.

00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:33.200
NARRATOR: Collins from Maine
objects to a $16 billion

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:35.800
program for school construction.

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.300
I knew that that would create
huge opposition on my side

00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:43.133
of the aisle, because
we'd be redefining

00:02:43.133 --> 00:02:44.700
the federal role in education.

00:02:44.700 --> 00:02:47.400
And then the conversation
kind of shifted

00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:49.533
over to health clinics.

00:02:49.533 --> 00:02:52.600
And there was a suggestion
made that we could take some

00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:54.967
of those resources and
put them into constructing

00:02:54.967 --> 00:02:58.500
community health clinics,
even in the state of Maine.

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:03.400
And she lit up and showed
some real interest.

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.967
On this vote, the yeas are 61.

00:03:06.967 --> 00:03:09.133
The nays are 36.

00:03:09.133 --> 00:03:12.000
3/5 of the senators
duly chosen and sworn

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.233
having voted in the affirmative,
the motion is agreed to.
