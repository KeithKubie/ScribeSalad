that an early stage that I might not
 

00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:16.379
that an early stage that I might not
become a very good doctor but was

00:04:16.379 --> 00:04:16.389
become a very good doctor but was
 

00:04:16.389 --> 00:04:19.199

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:16.030
from basic science progress in chemistry
 

00:05:16.030 --> 00:05:18.000
from basic science progress in chemistry
and biology would be much slower and

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:18.010
and biology would be much slower and
 

00:05:18.010 --> 00:05:23.550
and biology would be much slower and
might even come to a standstill thank
