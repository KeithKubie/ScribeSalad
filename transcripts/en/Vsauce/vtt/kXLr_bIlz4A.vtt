00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.819
This website lets you create a custom
message that takes up the entire page.

00:00:04.819 --> 00:00:08.840
You can then share the custom URL with
friends to say something loudly

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.200
bigly, but for more things you can do online

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:15.730
now, guys, this is DONG.
The Sound Walk

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.850
is like Guitar Hero meets a
side-scrolling platform

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:22.650
meets darkness. You have to press the
right keys to the beat of the music to

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.109
overcome obstacles.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:31.050
URL shorteners are useful, but I prefer URL

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:35.969
elongators, like this one. Enter a
short, easy to remember URL and

00:00:35.969 --> 00:00:37.190
convert it into something

00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:41.870
awesome like this.
TheHumanSuitcase recommended

00:00:41.870 --> 00:00:45.430
Test Pilot, an excellent game where you
have to design your vehicle,

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:48.600
its propulsion and even its controls.
Now,

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.980
every time your puny little craft fails,
be sure to tab on over to the Sad

00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:53.739
Trombone,

00:00:53.739 --> 00:00:58.320
where with 1-click you can feel like a loser.

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.140
If you prefer
Christopher Walken's favorite noise,

00:01:03.149 --> 00:01:05.749
use MoreCowbell.dj

00:01:05.749 --> 00:01:08.780
to have cowbells 
automatically added to any MP3 you

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.990
upload. Now, I have yet to be totally
impressed by it, but I believe in what stands for.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.720
Dragonborn3 calmed me down
with Procatinator.com.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.060
Endless giant loops of cats

00:01:22.060 --> 00:01:25.530
with fun music. And Superbanito sent me
a colour matching

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:29.520
game, where you have to find the right color
and eventually move onto tasks

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:35.280
like locating complementary colours.
In Gravity Duck you have to switch

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:38.810
gravity's direction to stay safe.

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.470
And doing poses like these allow album
artwork to extend in the real life,

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:46.850
you can check them out at SleeveFace.com.

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:50.910
Symon is an eery point-and-clicking, where you
explore your own dreams

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.210
and try to understand their
"doesn't quite make sense"

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:58.080
logic. And if you prefer everything,
Howard Hallis

00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:04.340
has drawn it. Jensmalm showed me a
210 square foot picture of everything.

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:08.509
It took years to draw and contains
thousands of characters, celebrities,

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:09.070
memes.

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:12.459
It's got every single Pokemon and,
although Howard doesn't want to be

00:02:12.459 --> 00:02:13.819
famous for this reason,

00:02:13.819 --> 00:02:17.560
because he drew Waldo into it, it has become the

00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.320
largest "Where's Waldo?" image ever made by a man.

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.860
Oh and here is something.
MoanMyIP

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:28.180
displays your device's Internet Protocol address

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:31.519
while girls sensually moan it.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:40.160
Now, if you want weird stuff, Overthemoon206 sent me this playlist of

00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:40.810
ilogically

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:45.209
awesome comedy and art. It's not scientific
or educational or anything, but it contains a

00:02:45.209 --> 00:02:47.190
lot of cool channel 101 stuff

00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.310
and more. And finally, Kevin showed me
OverAnalyzers yesterday, which I

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:53.400
promptly watched

00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:57.200
all of. A bunch of brilliant researchers sent around
trying to figure out things like,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:00.410
"where did the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles
get the money they

00:03:00.410 --> 00:03:04.620
used to buy pizza?" or
"how could Batman and Robin have gotten dressed

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:08.530
while sliding down a fireman's pole?"
Well, I've got a playlist of their episodes in the

00:03:08.530 --> 00:03:09.730
description, where links to

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:11.730
everything can be found.

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:12.650
And as always,

00:03:12.650 --> 00:03:14.030
thanks for watching.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.650
One more thing. If you're tired of your
boring, simple

00:03:21.650 --> 00:03:25.040
email address, why not go to this site?
For free,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.020
you can set up a new email address with
what is most likely the longest

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:32.180
possible address?
For instance, I made

00:03:32.180 --> 00:03:35.440
this one. Seriously.
