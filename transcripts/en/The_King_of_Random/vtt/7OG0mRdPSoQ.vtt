00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.918
In today's video,

00:00:00.918 --> 00:00:03.200
we're going to be playing
with sulfur hexafluoride,

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.140
and see if it can be used to put out
1,000 burning candles at once.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:16.900
[Music]

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:18.200
Hey guys, I'm Nate.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.220
And I'm Calli.

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.280
This stuff is weird.

00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.220
Oh no.

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:28.180
This is as high as I can make
my voice go right now.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:30.740
In his video, Nick Uhas
tried to put out

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:32.458
three hundred candles
with sulfur hexafluoride.

00:00:32.458 --> 00:00:34.040
We're going to try a thousand.

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:35.157
Sulfur hexafluoride is

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.300
a really dense gas
that doesn't burn,

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:38.112
and so, you can use it

00:00:38.112 --> 00:00:40.615
to actually extinguished things
that are burning.

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:43.900
We currently have this tub
full of sulfur hexafluoride.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.240
As demonstrated by this balloon,

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.000
which is just full
of normal breath air,

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:50.940
which is now floating
on the sulfur hexafluoride.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:51.940
Sulfur hexafluoride is

00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:54.960
between five and six
times more dense than air,

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:56.220
so balloons will float on it,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.260
and it should stay in this box.

00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:00.040
We're going to play around
with it for a little bit,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.650
and then we're going to see
if we can take what Nick did,

00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:03.812
and scale it up a lot,

00:01:03.812 --> 00:01:06.436
and put out a thousand
tea light candles at once.

00:01:06.436 --> 00:01:07.737
Here's the basic idea.

00:01:07.737 --> 00:01:10.749
Sulfur hexafluoride is a heavy
gas that displaces oxygen,

00:01:10.749 --> 00:01:12.020
and doesn't burn.

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.440
So we think if we
fill this container,

00:01:13.449 --> 00:01:15.050
we might be able to pour it out,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:18.340
and put out 1,000 burning
candles all at once.

00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.340
Now, this stuff is most famously
known as deep breath gas,

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.849
because when you breathe it in,

00:01:23.849 --> 00:01:25.648
because it's so
much heavier than air,

00:01:25.648 --> 00:01:27.183
it does make the sound coming

00:01:27.183 --> 00:01:29.120
from your vocal chords
sound much deeper.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:31.500
I've no idea what
you're talking about.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.720
It can be
a pretty drastic change.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:36.580
This isn't a helium balloon.

00:01:36.583 --> 00:01:37.505
In normal air,

00:01:37.505 --> 00:01:40.800
it just falls to the ground
or the table like normal.

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:43.900
Gets you a
little bit lightheaded,

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:44.900
kind of like helium.

00:01:44.900 --> 00:01:47.150
It displaces air,
including air in your lungs.

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.838
It's so much heavier
than normal air,

00:01:48.838 --> 00:01:49.888
it won't push it out.

00:01:49.888 --> 00:01:51.060
So you really have to breathe

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:53.040
in and out a lot to get
it out of your body.

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:54.900
Otherwise, you're just going
to start getting lightheaded.

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.100
So yeah, balloon just falls
to the desk normally,

00:01:57.100 --> 00:01:58.987
other than the fact that it's
like got static electricity,

00:01:58.987 --> 00:02:00.450
and sticking to my hand
a little bit.

00:02:00.450 --> 00:02:03.260
But once you really
let go of it, it falls.

00:02:03.260 --> 00:02:04.900
But you let go of it
in the sulfur hexafluoride,

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:07.160
it's floating on the gas there.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:11.160
This little foil scoop here,

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.660
and currently, it's
just full of normal air.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:14.940
Doesn't do anything to a candle.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:18.000
But carefully scoop
up some completely

00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.080
invisible sulfur hexafluoride...

00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:24.540
Puts it out immediately.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:42.020
[Music]

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.500
That took nothing.

00:02:43.500 --> 00:02:44.760
That worked great.

00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.080
Oh, this is gonna be amazing.

00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:52.560
[Music]

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.000
I mean, we do have
several flamethrowers,

00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:56.740
which hopefully will make it

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.338
so it doesn't take so
long to light them all,

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.560
when we're ready to do
the actual burn.

00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.300
I've got my hair down,

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.320
so I'll let Nate
handle the lighting.

00:03:05.660 --> 00:03:07.000
And now, worry about organizing.

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:33.880
[Music]

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.600
Guys, we've now got
one thousand candles

00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:37.460
on the workbench.

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:38.750
I actually didn't think
it was going to fit,

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:39.568
but they did.

00:03:39.568 --> 00:03:41.280
&gt;&gt; We've got--
&gt;&gt; Should add more.

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:43.487
We've got 28 candles
going this direction,

00:03:43.487 --> 00:03:45.740
and we've got 35 going here.

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:46.820
That's the complete rows,

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:49.780
and then in our 36th row,
we've got another 20.

00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:51.420
So we've got 980 in the grid,

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:54.740
plus 20 more,
it's a thousand total candles.

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:55.880
So before we light them,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:57.500
what we're going to do
is add a barrier.

00:03:57.500 --> 00:03:58.340
We're going to take
some foam core,

00:03:58.342 --> 00:03:59.513
and just tape it to the sides

00:03:59.513 --> 00:04:02.200
of the workbench so it goes up
above the level of the candles,

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:02.754
and that way,

00:04:02.754 --> 00:04:04.636
any sulfur hexafluoride
pouring down won't just

00:04:04.636 --> 00:04:05.673
like run off the table.

00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:07.340
It should stay contained,

00:04:07.340 --> 00:04:09.105
make sure everything gets put
out the way it should.

00:04:09.105 --> 00:04:11.734

to get these two t-shirts

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.220

[Music]

00:04:44.560 --> 00:04:46.240
I think it's time to start
lighting some candles.

00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:47.450
It's gonna take a while.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.940
We can do it.

00:04:47.940 --> 00:05:26.080
[Music]

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.500
You just stay on the--

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:28.820
Ah, there's so many going out.

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:29.320
It's okay.

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.820
It's okay.

00:05:29.860 --> 00:05:31.060
I'm light--
I'm gonna keep lighting.

00:05:31.063 --> 00:05:32.005
You start pouring.

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:33.000
Try the blow torch.

00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:33.800
Oh my gosh.

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.900
It's like a furnace
putting my arm over it.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.950
Just trying to light
the ones in the middle.

00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:40.760
There's, there's like more out
than lit now.

00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:43.620
Go, go, go!

00:05:48.740 --> 00:05:49.880
You're blowing these out.

00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.480
You're actually just
blowing them out.

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:52.960
We don't have a back-up plan.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:56.460
This was the backup plan.

00:05:56.460 --> 00:05:57.860
Let's just pour it on.

00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:00.920
3, 2, 1.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.160
[Music]

00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:10.740
All right, a couple things
have gone wrong here.

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:12.400
Oh my gosh, I can't breathe.

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:15.340
Well, it didn't go
the way we planned,

00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.860
but there's more few more things
that we can try

00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:19.080
that should make it pretty cool.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.580
There was a lot of heat coming
off of those candles.

00:06:21.587 --> 00:06:22.785
Enough that the candles

00:06:22.785 --> 00:06:25.520
in the middle just
completely liquefied,

00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:28.680
and when that happened, a lot of
the wicks started to curl over,

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:30.740
and they actually
got submerged in the wax,

00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:31.580
and stop burning.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:33.380
Doesn't matter how many times
you try and pull those out,

00:06:33.389 --> 00:06:35.148
there's enough heat
radiating off of this

00:06:35.148 --> 00:06:37.120
that we could fix
it all fast enough.

00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.135
And combine the wicks
being partially submerged,

00:06:39.135 --> 00:06:41.165
even like that,
they may be able to burn.

00:06:41.165 --> 00:06:43.880
Like this one here
is fairly exposed.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.220
So I might be able to light
that wick right now,

00:06:46.220 --> 00:06:47.550
and maybe it will stay burning,

00:06:47.550 --> 00:06:48.850
but we had so much

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:51.580
like of a draft
from that many candles

00:06:51.580 --> 00:06:52.940
that there wasn't,

00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.760
you know, all of the air
was just getting disturbed,

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.300
and so nothing
was staying still,

00:06:56.300 --> 00:06:58.960
and so we just had so many
that wouldn't stay lit.

00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.440
So we did for the sulfur
hexafluoride on probably 600

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:03.000
of them still burning?

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.040
But we want a thousand.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:06.160
So as I said,
the problem is

00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.240
that the wicks were getting
submerged in the liquid wax.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:10.779
So what we're doing now
is just going to cut

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.720
some little strips
of paper towel,

00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.720
and dip those into the candles,

00:07:14.720 --> 00:07:16.000
and have them sticking
out over the edge

00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.600
so they can't be submerged,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.980
and then we'll
try lighting that,

00:07:19.780 --> 00:07:23.380
and paper towels should work
to wick the wax up pretty well,

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:24.840
and hopefully, keep
everything burning.

00:07:24.842 --> 00:08:06.160
[Music]

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.640
Okay, we-- We lit
the table on fire.

00:08:09.700 --> 00:08:12.940
So now, this is a matter
of we really need this to work.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:14.540
3, 2, 1.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:21.100
[Music]

00:08:21.140 --> 00:08:22.180
It's really close!

00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:24.000
And now, go outside.

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:24.500
Outside!

00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:25.080
Outside!

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:27.640
It worked,

00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.780
except I'm worried
about my co-workers.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.132
Come on.

00:08:32.380 --> 00:08:35.080
We got most of the candles lit,

00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:37.640
and the ones that went out,
we actually took pieces

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:38.820
of paper towel
like Nate was saying.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:41.620
We dipped them
into the melted wax,

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.800
and we are able to relight them.

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.200
So for any gaps
that you might have seen,

00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.260
we had two or three weeks going
in other candles

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.040
to make sure we
still had a thousand lit,

00:08:49.050 --> 00:08:50.850
and then the table lit on fire.

00:08:50.850 --> 00:08:52.740
So it actually worked out,

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:54.815
and now, we're just
airing out the room.

00:08:54.820 --> 00:08:58.100
We'll be able to see
the results in a minute.

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.460
It's very smoky.

00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:09.160
[Music]

00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:10.280
This is actually amazing.

00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:11.960
But you can actually see areas

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.560
where we had a lot
of overheating problems,

00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.480
and we set the table on fire.

00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:16.300
Yeah.

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.000
Yeah, there was a lot of heat.

00:09:19.660 --> 00:09:20.580
Yeah, the--

00:09:20.580 --> 00:09:21.380
We did--

00:09:21.380 --> 00:09:23.120
I would say you
just avoid doing that.

00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:25.460
Yeah, maybe stick
of the 300 tea lights.

00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:28.200
Three hundred and space
them out quite a bit more.

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:29.400
It was really fun.

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.080
We actually managed
to get it to work.

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:32.480
Most of the sulfur hexafluoride

00:09:32.480 --> 00:09:34.280
did blow out most
of the candles,

00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:35.400
which was really cool.

00:09:36.480 --> 00:09:38.460
But then the smoke
alarms went off.

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:39.160
Yeah.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.680
Thanks for the idea, Nick.

00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.240
Guys, today is
the last day of our sale.
