00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
The vital ingredient for stiffness is that the model includes to vary different time scales.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
That's not the case for this spacecraft and that's not the case for the 1D harmonic oscillator.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000
But with the cloth simulation, we do have to vary different time scales.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Imagine this cloth to be composed of tons of tiny, tiny springs.

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is actually how cloth simulation is being done.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
If you push the cloth in this direction, you're working against the stiff spring,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
meaning you're working on a very small time scale.

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000
If you push the cloth up, you're rotating that spring, meaning you're working on a slow time scale.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
This is a very annoying problem for the simulation of pieces of clothing,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000
in video games, and for special effects in movies.

00:00:48.000 --> 09:59:59.000
You do not want to use time steps of microseconds for something that seems so simple.
