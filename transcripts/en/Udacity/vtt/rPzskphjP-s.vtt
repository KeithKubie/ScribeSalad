00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.850
Alright, lets see how you did and fill out the

00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.870
concept map together. Lets start here in the center, personal

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:08.490
genetics. The decision to know is personal. And you must

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:12.460
provide consent. We talk more about the idea of consent and

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:16.090
the social implications of personal genetic information in lesson 12.

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:18.970
Now if we want to learn more about our personal genetics. The

00:00:18.970 --> 00:00:22.420
23andMe process starts with a DNA sample obtained from our

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.300
saliva. And we can learn more about DNA, we learned about

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:31.010
the basics in Lesson 2. Now, the DNA sample and saliva is sent to the lab for

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:33.530
DNA extraction. And then there's a step of

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:38.690
DNA amplification. After amplification the sample will be hybridized

00:00:38.690 --> 00:00:40.490
on a chip and the important part is

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.930
this is not sequencing, right, we learn that this

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:46.340
is not sequencing he genome. We're actually screening for

00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:50.410
1 million different SNV's or Single Nuclear type Variance.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:54.010
And they're named individually by their rsID

00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:56.710
and together all these SNV's can represent

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.518
different alleles. And we learn more about

00:00:59.518 --> 00:01:03.780
alleles, in lesson 6 in particular. But,

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:05.670
once we have this information then were

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:08.720
ready for Data Assembly and Analysis. Our

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.090
results will include information about traits, and

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.500
ancestry. We talked at length about traits

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.280
in lesson one, and a bit more in lesson five. The

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.690
types of traits we can learn about include monogenic traits, which

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.750
we'll learn more about in lesson eight, complex traits, which we'll

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:27.780
learn more about in lesson nine, and even particular traits that

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:31.030
have to do with interactions with drugs. Which we'll learn more

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:34.270
about in lesson 10. Now the information we learn about our

00:01:34.270 --> 00:01:38.210
ancestry tracks our maternal line, our paternal line and even family

00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:40.970
relationships which we'll learn a bit more about in lesson 11.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.390
And we actually use a calculation called IBD,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.390
or Identity By Descent, to determine some of

00:01:46.390 --> 00:01:50.105
these family relationships. Together, combining information about our

00:01:50.105 --> 00:01:52.500
ancestry and traits, we get a look at our

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.940
family traits. Which track individual genes. Shared by

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.940
various relatives. And we learned a lot about genes

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:03.720
in lessons three and four. I hope you

00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.300
have a new appreciation for how all the information

00:02:06.300 --> 00:02:09.680
we learned about so far is connected. And how it connects

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:12.860
into the information that we're going to learn in the remaining lessons.
