00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.320
Multiply negative 4x squared
by the whole expression

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:07.780
3x squared plus 25x minus 7.

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:10.016
So if you multiply anything
times a whole expression,

00:00:10.016 --> 00:00:11.890
you really just use the
distributive property

00:00:11.890 --> 00:00:14.440
to multiply each term
of the expression

00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:16.131
by the negative 4x squared.

00:00:16.131 --> 00:00:17.630
So we're going to
have to distribute

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:22.400
this negative 4x squared over
every term in the expression.

00:00:22.400 --> 00:00:24.530
So first, we could
start with negative 4x

00:00:24.530 --> 00:00:26.715
squared times 3x squared.

00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:27.590
So we can write that.

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:32.990
We're going to have negative
4x squared times 3x squared.

00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:38.320
And to that, we're going to add
negative 4x squared times 25x.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.440
And to that, we're going
to add negative 4x squared

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.465
times negative 7.

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:53.890
So let's just simplify
this a little bit.

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:56.306
Now, we can obviously
swap the order.

00:00:56.306 --> 00:00:57.930
We're just multiplying
negative 4 times

00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:59.469
x squared times 3
times x squared.

00:00:59.469 --> 00:01:01.010
And actually, I'll
do out every step.

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:03.140
Eventually, you can do
some of this in your head.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:07.430
This is the exact same thing
as negative 4 times 3 times

00:01:07.430 --> 00:01:11.147
x squared times x squared.

00:01:11.147 --> 00:01:12.230
And what is that equal to?

00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.820
Well, negative 4 times
3 is negative 12.

00:01:15.820 --> 00:01:18.180
And x squared times x
squared-- same base.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:19.430
We're taking the product.

00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:21.740
That's going to be
x to the fourth.

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.930
So this right here is
negative 12x to the fourth.

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:28.340
Now let's think about
this term over here.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:30.540
This is the same thing
as-- and of course,

00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:32.880
we have this plus out here.

00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.230
And then this part right
here is the exact same thing

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:44.120
as 25 times negative 4
times x squared times x.

00:01:44.120 --> 00:01:46.150
So let's just multiply
the numbers out here.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:47.520
These were the coefficients.

00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:50.447
25 times negative
4 is negative 100.

00:01:50.447 --> 00:01:52.280
So it'll plus negative
100, or we could just

00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:54.820
say it's minus 100.

00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:56.610
And then we have
x squared times x,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.770
or x squared times x
to the first power.

00:01:59.770 --> 00:02:02.070
Same base-- we can
add the exponents.

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:03.690
2 plus 1 is 3.

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:08.020
So this is negative
100x to the third power.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.320
And then let's look at
this last term over here.

00:02:10.320 --> 00:02:11.871
We have negative 4x squared.

00:02:11.871 --> 00:02:13.370
So this is going
to be plus-- that's

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.030
this plus right over here.

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:17.790
We have negative 4.

00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:20.390
We can multiply that
times negative 7.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.730
And then multiply
that times x squared.

00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.240
I'm just changing the order
in which we multiply it.

00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.130
So negative 4 times
negative 7 is positive 28.

00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:35.010
And then I'm going to multiply
that times the x squared.

00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:37.450
There's no simplification
to do, no like terms.

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.200
These are different powers of x.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.876
So we are done.
