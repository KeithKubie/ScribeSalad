Olivia Wu: I don't need to say a whole lot
about Rick. You know about him.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:14.480
Many a James Bear Awards -- Chef of the Year,
Restaurant of the Year, Humanitarian of the

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:20.780
Year -- so many, so many awards.
But I do want to say that "Fiesta at Rick's"

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:32.220
has been for five weeks on the New York Times
bestseller list.

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.320
And so, this is the seventh book. And what
season in the?

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:35.590
Rick Bayless: Seven too.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:38.550
Olivia Wu: Seventh season in, in Mexico: "One
Plate at a Time". So,so welcome. Why don't

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.210
you start by saying what this book is about
and why did you, why did you write it?

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:46.430
Rick Bayless: Well, thanks first of all to
everybody that's here. It's a real pleasure

00:00:46.430 --> 00:00:53.239
to be here. My head is sort of swimming because
I just got a tour of part of the Google campus.

00:00:53.239 --> 00:00:59.550
And so, I'm, I'm still sort of in awe of all
this really cool stuff and the espresso machines

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:04.610
on every floor and all of that sort of stuff.
It's like I feel like a kid in a candy store

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.170
as I was going -- "Oh! There's that. And then,
they've got that!" So you guys are lucky to

00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:10.420
work in a place like this.

00:01:10.420 --> 00:01:15.420
The laundry -- that really surprised me. [laughter]
I wasn't quite sure what to think about the

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:20.409
laundry, but I, I thought, "Maybe now we need
to do that at our restaurant and have the

00:01:20.409 --> 00:01:24.560
laundry so that everybody can bring their
laundry and do it while they're at work."

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.719
I don't know. We have to think about that
one.

00:01:26.719 --> 00:01:31.719
The â€“ I -- You guys have more space than
we have in downtown Chicago.

00:01:31.719 --> 00:01:40.969
I love learning about food anywhere in the
world, but when I got to Mexico as a teenager,

00:01:40.969 --> 00:01:48.299
I just totally fell in love. And in fact,
I went there at 14, and I found that, that

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:53.770
it, it felt like my home -- like I was going
home -- not like I was going to some strange

00:01:53.770 --> 00:01:55.229
and exotic place.

00:01:55.229 --> 00:02:02.999
And I, and what I so loved about Mexico was
the dynamism of the culture. Now, if you've

00:02:02.999 --> 00:02:09.950
only been to, to Cancun, then you probably
haven't seen this side of the culture.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:16.670
There's a certain dynamism in Cancun, but
it is actually more about the American guests

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:20.870
that are there rather than what that culture
has to offer.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:27.930
It's a, it's a culture that really values
 -- not only food in general, but food together

00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:32.900
as groups.
And because they follow the liturgical calendar,

00:02:32.900 --> 00:02:37.480
there's all these different things that they're
celebrating at different times. And what I

00:02:37.480 --> 00:02:43.970
loved when I was living in Mexico later in
my twenties was that every season brought

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:50.130
some new special dish that was celebrated
as part of one of these big fiestas -- they

00:02:50.130 --> 00:02:54.520
may be town fiestas, they may be people's
birthdays, they may be something to do with

00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:01.430
the church calendar -- but in any case, they
were something that was sparked by some great

00:03:01.430 --> 00:03:05.900
food that usually was very seasonal, very
local.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:11.790
And I grew up in the barbecue business -- the
barbecue world in Oklahoma City. And one of

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.810
the things that I, I was taught by my father
growing up was that we were the, the holders

00:03:19.810 --> 00:03:25.400
of this incredible tradition in our area.
Because if you thought -- when I was growing

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:31.400
up -- about food that was "our" food in Oklahoma
City -- people's minds always went to barbecue.

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:36.920
And because barbecue restaurants always have
catering arms, because there are, there's

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:43.600
a need for people to celebrate their local
special occasions with barbecue.

00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:45.390
So I grew up doing all of that stuff.

00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:51.819
Then, I got to Mexico and I, I realize I knew
nothing about regionality.

00:03:51.819 --> 00:03:56.560
Because we had our sort of special barbecue
in Oklahoma -- and it was different than Texas

00:03:56.560 --> 00:04:01.950
and it was different than Kansas -- but, in
Mexico, I could drive, I could travel five

00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:08.130
miles, and the people would have a whole different
roster of dishes that they associated as their

00:04:08.130 --> 00:04:11.069
special stuff.
And I remember one time when I was living

00:04:11.069 --> 00:04:15.400
in Mexico and I was looking for these little
empanadas in a town in northern Mexico -- and

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.560
I had read that they make them for special
festival at a, at a certain time of year -- so

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.590
I went there, and nobody had them.
And nobody said anything.

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:26.050
They said, "No, no -- we don't have those.
No, no, no, no."

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:28.960
And people were just brushing me off right
and left.

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:33.279
And I finally, I finally found somebody that
I could really talk to about it.

00:04:33.279 --> 00:04:35.749
And she goes, "No, you're asking in the wrong
town.

00:04:35.749 --> 00:04:39.650
That's like three kilometers down the road.
That's where they make that."

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:45.180
And I realized at that moment how proud people
were to have created a certain thing and really

00:04:45.180 --> 00:04:49.409
identify with it.
And then, to share it with people -- to share

00:04:49.409 --> 00:04:53.759
it as part of a big celebration.
So I grew up in a family that did a lot of

00:04:53.759 --> 00:04:56.860
catering and had a lot of parties and that
sort of stuff.

00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:01.449
I got to Mexico, and it was like what I had
grown up with on steroids.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:09.110
And I, I, I just felt so comfortable in a,
in a culture that could celebrate -- and that

00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.240
they understood the role of food in that celebration.
The celebration wasn't about the food, but

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:21.740
the food played an integral role in the, in,
in the kick-off of the celebration.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:26.680
And then, they have this thing in Mexico after
the food is done and everybody's sittin' around

00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:32.849
tables -- they have this thing that they call
"sobremesa" -- which means, just literally

00:05:32.849 --> 00:05:37.529
translated is, "over the table," because you're
sharing things over the table with people.

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:40.430
And that can go on for hours and hours and
hours.

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:46.809
And it all came from the fact that the people
came around the table together, they had this

00:05:46.809 --> 00:05:52.229
food that sparked the whole thing, and then,
it turned into the real party -- which was

00:05:52.229 --> 00:05:55.539
the sharing between people, and I just love
that.

00:05:55.539 --> 00:06:00.680
Not only could I relate to it from my growing
up, but I could, I could understand it from

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:07.509
an even bigger and broader perspective.
So I've done a lot of research -- pardon me

00:06:07.509 --> 00:06:12.949
[sneezing] -- I've done a lot of research
in Mexico studying the regional foods, sort

00:06:12.949 --> 00:06:17.629
of breaking it down into its bits and pieces,
translating that into something that people

00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:24.089
in the United States can understand, sort
of in its, in its 'building block' bits so

00:06:24.089 --> 00:06:31.339
that all of us here can go home and we can
make food that has an authentic flavor.

00:06:31.339 --> 00:06:37.710
And so, I've tried to be the translator between
the traditional foods of Mexico and the American

00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:40.379
kitchen.
And I've done that many -- in different ways.

00:06:40.379 --> 00:06:45.779
My first book was a book that was sort of
a snapshot of regional cooking in Mexico back

00:06:45.779 --> 00:06:50.620
in the 80s 'cause that's when I lived in Mexico.
And I went -- I spent five years writing that

00:06:50.620 --> 00:06:53.370
book.
And I traveled to every single state in the

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.740
Mexican republic.
I cooked with local cooks. I went to every

00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.469
market.
I have books and books of catalogs of what

00:06:59.469 --> 00:07:03.819
was in all of the market stalls, what people
were cooking in the street, street stalls

00:07:03.819 --> 00:07:09.979
and -- for special occasions and all of that.
I really did that work -- well, I was in graduate

00:07:09.979 --> 00:07:13.779
school in anthropology and linguistics and
I learned how to study culture.

00:07:13.779 --> 00:07:16.900
And I just applied that to my love for Mexican
food.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:22.499
And that first book was really very carefully
researched from that perspective.

00:07:22.499 --> 00:07:27.089
Then, I did a bunch of other books focusing
on different aspects of Mexican cooking.

00:07:27.089 --> 00:07:31.970
And then, all of a sudden I got to this place
where after sort of 25 years of writing about

00:07:31.970 --> 00:07:37.490
Mexican food and cooking this food every day,
I decided that what I wanted to do was to

00:07:37.490 --> 00:07:45.379
share with everybody the, the way that I approach
this food from this deep knowledge -- that

00:07:45.379 --> 00:07:50.199
the way I approach this food when I've got
to get dinner on the table in 30 minutes.

00:07:50.199 --> 00:07:56.050
And it wasn't like I was trying to do Mexican
Fast or Mexican Light or anything like that.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:00.580
I was just showing you like what I learned
from the Mexican grandmas that gotta turn

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:04.409
out food for a big family every day.
And they know all these shortcuts, and they

00:08:04.409 --> 00:08:07.509
can make this food quickly.
So I, I did a whole book that I just call

00:08:07.509 --> 00:08:10.749
"Mexican Every Day."
And it's all simple food -- all made from

00:08:10.749 --> 00:08:16.509
fresh ingredients -- no sense of like, "Oh,
well, if you buy this already-prepared thing,

00:08:16.509 --> 00:08:19.619
then it'll take some time off."
But no, it's all just like you go to the grocery

00:08:19.619 --> 00:08:22.629
store.
I chose to only work with ingredients that

00:08:22.629 --> 00:08:27.149
you could get at any well-stocked grocery
store.

00:08:27.149 --> 00:08:32.339
My, my rule of thumb was, "If I could make
it in 30 minutes, then it was something that

00:08:32.339 --> 00:08:39.190
would be good for, for the book."
And I wanted to be able to just offer simple,

00:08:39.190 --> 00:08:46.460
fresh stuff that mostly could become a whole
meal, like maybe dress some grains and have

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:48.120
a salad to go with them.
But, then you've got your meal, okay?

00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:52.100
And 'cause that's kind of the way I cook a
lot of times when I'm cookin' for my family

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:53.820
at home.
And I just thought, "I wanna get something

00:08:53.820 --> 00:08:58.240
fresh and delicious on the table, and it's
got to all sort of be cooked in one pot so

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.930
that I don't have a lot of pots to clean up
afterwards."

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:06.640
So I did that, and it was super-successful.
And, and so, I got to thinking after that,

00:09:06.640 --> 00:09:13.010
"Well, where do I want to go next with it?"
And in the intro to "Mexican Every Day", I

00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:18.550
talked about my philosophy for eating and
living, because I think it's all part of the

00:09:18.550 --> 00:09:24.060
same thing -- and one of the places that we
really get off track I think in our society

00:09:24.060 --> 00:09:29.490
is that we try to compartmentalize everything
so that we've got the food and diet over here,

00:09:29.490 --> 00:09:33.300
we've got the exercise over there, and we've
got the socializing over -- it's all sort

00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:36.760
of the same thing.
It's all about sort of how do you live your

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.260
life?
And in the intro to "Mexican Every Day", I

00:09:40.260 --> 00:09:43.330
wanted to just focus on that.
I wanted to say sort of, "These are the way

00:09:43.330 --> 00:09:47.840
that I integrate things in, in my life on
an everyday basis."

00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.180
I eat simply during the week.
And what I learned in Mexico is that, on the

00:09:51.180 --> 00:09:55.800
weekends, it's the fiesta.
And you, you eat stuff you would never eat

00:09:55.800 --> 00:09:58.830
during the week.
And you put more time in it.

00:09:58.830 --> 00:10:03.720
And you sit around the table all afternoon.
And you enjoy the people that you care about.

00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:11.510
And every weekend is a, a, a fiesta day, basically.
There's some time on, in that weekend where

00:10:11.510 --> 00:10:15.430
you bring people together.
And there's always some kind of special food

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:18.680
that's made for that.
Maybe it takes a little more time to make.

00:10:18.680 --> 00:10:23.830
Maybe it requires an ingredient that either
costs extra money or is harder to find.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:27.480
But you just think about it during the week
and you kind of get it together and you bring

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:32.590
the people around and the food sparks it and
then the good times ensue.

00:10:32.590 --> 00:10:37.160
And so, after I had, I had talked about that
in the introduction to "Mexican Every Day",

00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:41.470
I, I decided that what I really need to do
is write the book for that.

00:10:41.470 --> 00:10:46.780
So, "Fiesta at Rick's" is really that book.
It's the stuff that I do when I bring people

00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:50.640
together.
And I decided to call it -- not "Mexican Fiesta,"

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.350
 -- but "Fiesta at Rick's", because I love
to have people over.

00:10:54.350 --> 00:11:03.040
And even though I'm in the restaurant business
and I am hosting thousands of people every

00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:07.680
week through our restaurant that are celebrating
all different kinds of things, that's not

00:11:07.680 --> 00:11:12.910
my fiesta. That's their fiesta.
And I feel honored to be able to create a

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:17.690
place where people can have their fiestas.
But on the weekends, I want to have mine.

00:11:17.690 --> 00:11:22.930
And so, I have people over almost every weekend,
sometimes casual, sometimes more elaborate

00:11:22.930 --> 00:11:27.010
or involved.
But I wanted to share the kinds of things

00:11:27.010 --> 00:11:30.930
that I like to do when I have people over
 -- when I'm puttin' a little bit more thought

00:11:30.930 --> 00:11:34.440
in it, I have a little bit more time to get
stuff on the table.

00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.590
And maybe I have more time to search out those
special ingredients that could go into it.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:47.390
So I decided that I would divide this new
book into chapters that are sort of not-your-normal

00:11:47.390 --> 00:11:51.500
cookbook chapters, but more of the kinds of
ways I think of parties.

00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:57.220
So, sometimes, somebody'll be comin' through
town, and I'll say to them, "Oh, just come

00:11:57.220 --> 00:12:00.670
over for a drink," you know?
So I gotta have some food to set out. It's

00:12:00.670 --> 00:12:03.500
because it's just like I want to put something
out â€“ so there's a whole chapter in there

00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:07.740
on guacamoles and little snack stuff and great
drinks.

00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:11.130
And that sort of is a party.
I mean that can be a party just in and of

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:14.200
itself.
Then, there's another chapter that I like

00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:19.910
to focus on in the summer time a lot of times,
because it's such a big deal to do seafood

00:12:19.910 --> 00:12:24.580
cocktails and ceviches and stuff like that.
I think they should never be buried.

00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:28.910
And especially in our country, they should
never be buried as like part of a meal unless

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:34.800
you're just really pullin' out all the stops.
But, you focus a whole party around those

00:12:34.800 --> 00:12:37.970
things.
I have a chapter of that kind of stuff.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:42.850
And then, there's this thing that the Mexican
street vendors do that I just love and hardly

00:12:42.850 --> 00:12:46.410
anybody does it in the United States.
They make all these different dishes -- some

00:12:46.410 --> 00:12:51.540
cold and some warm -- and they all are sort
of chopped up stuff that is mixed together

00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:56.220
 -- maybe simmered together.
And then, you say, "I'd like a little of that

00:12:56.220 --> 00:12:58.570
and little of that and a little of that."
And they put down a corn tortilla, and they

00:12:58.570 --> 00:13:02.510
put some of it on there and they hand it to
you -- just like tapas in Spain, only they're

00:13:02.510 --> 00:13:07.610
using bread for the tapas in Spain, but in
Mexico, they use a corn tortilla.

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:12.110
And there's this amazing place in the Condesa
section of Mexico City.

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:18.740
I did a show there on the last season of the
show that -- oh, we went to -- it's called

00:13:18.740 --> 00:13:22.930
"Tacos Hola!"
And, they have about 25 different things in

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:27.010
these earthenware cazuelas.
And the guys -- the taqueros -- the guys that

00:13:27.010 --> 00:13:31.960
are making the little tacos -- stand behind
these 25 earthenware things, and they just

00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:36.610
give you one or two tacos out of whatever
you choose from all the cold stuff to the

00:13:36.610 --> 00:13:39.070
warm stuff.
And they do it with great flourish.

00:13:39.070 --> 00:13:44.780
And it's totally fabulous to go and experience
what they call "tacos de cazuela" -- "cazuela"

00:13:44.780 --> 00:13:48.970
referring to the pot that, that they serve
all that stuff in.

00:13:48.970 --> 00:13:52.520
So, I wanted to do that kind of thing.
So I did a whole chapter of that, because

00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:56.560
I think it's great party food.
Then, of course, a lot of us like to grill

00:13:56.560 --> 00:13:59.390
when you're gonna have people over.
I love to grill when I have people over.

00:13:59.390 --> 00:14:03.810
But the one thing that I, I think we miss
a lot in the United States is that we think

00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:07.050
of the grill as just quick and fast.
It's like you marinate something and you put

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:11.170
it on the grill and you're done.
But, there's some really cool stuff that you

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:14.890
can do with your grill as a kind of braising
device.

00:14:14.890 --> 00:14:20.260
So, I love to sear the meat, and then put
it into some kind of pot that I can just push

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:25.280
off to the side of the grill and put some
other ingredients in there, some liquidy ingredients

00:14:25.280 --> 00:14:30.350
in there and let things braise there and it
picks up the smokiness of the fire and you've

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:34.310
got the sear of the meat that was grilled
originally, but you can use cuts that have

00:14:34.310 --> 00:14:39.080
to simmer and stuff.
So that's the -- that whole thing is, is captured

00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:44.190
in my grilling section of this book.
And then, the sweets that I did are all inspired

00:14:44.190 --> 00:14:48.650
by sweets that you get from street vendors,
because, to me, those are really fun party

00:14:48.650 --> 00:14:53.230
kinds of things -- everything from how to
make your own homemade popsicles, to all different

00:14:53.230 --> 00:14:56.940
kinds of ice creams, and simple cakes and
stuff that the street vendors â€“ and candies

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:02.450
that the street vendors do.
So that's in a very, very long answer to your

00:15:02.450 --> 00:15:06.210
very short question, what this book is really
all about.

00:15:06.210 --> 00:15:13.430
But now I'm kind of sketched out for you the
sort of how those last two books kind of go

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:18.770
together and how this last book was really
born out of what I fell in love with in Mexico

00:15:18.770 --> 00:15:21.820
and that was sharing food with people around
the table.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.900
Olivia Wu: And, and it's true. The Fiestas
at Rick's are wonderful.

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.580
Rick Bayless: We've shared a lot of them through
the years.

00:15:28.580 --> 00:15:33.670
Olivia Wu: We've shared a lot of them, yeah.
So I love what you -- the word you chose -- "translator"

00:15:33.670 --> 00:15:37.290
 â€“ 'cause I feel that's what I'm, I'm doing.
And I remember a conversation we had maybe

00:15:37.290 --> 00:15:44.450
15 years ago where you felt â€“ you said to
me you felt your role was to be an ambassador

00:15:44.450 --> 00:15:51.060
of Mexican culture. Not easy.
I mean, when you opened Frontier in Topolobampo,

00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:57.990
most people in Chicago when they wanted Mexican
food, they wanted their burrito, they wanted,

00:15:57.990 --> 00:16:06.610
wanted their tacos carne asada with the pile
of meat that almost loses the, the, the tortilla

00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:11.590
in them.
You know, ethnic Mexican food was supposed

00:16:11.590 --> 00:16:13.040
to be cheap.

00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:14.320
Rick Bayless: It still is.

00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:16.230
Olivia Wu: It still is. Everything people
already know.

00:16:16.230 --> 00:16:19.650
And maybe kind of a not-so-clean restaurant.
How, how did you fight that?

00:16:19.650 --> 00:16:26.520
We had conversations back then about that.
I'm, I'm sure you don't have that now, but,

00:16:26.520 --> 00:16:28.870
talk a little about that.

00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:32.810
Rick Bayless: Well, the way I -- I wouldn't
say that I "fought" it, 'cause I'm not much

00:16:32.810 --> 00:16:38.180
of a fighter, but I try to seduce people with
flavor, number one.

00:16:38.180 --> 00:16:42.470
Because once you taste our food and you realize
that I really learned how to make it. I didn't

00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:46.550
just go on a 2-week trip to Mexico and said,
"Oh, this is fun. I'm gonna come back and

00:16:46.550 --> 00:16:48.880
open a restaurant."
But I really, really learned it.

00:16:48.880 --> 00:16:51.920
Like I said, through my first book, I spent
five years writing it.

00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:56.920
And it was after all of that that we opened
Frontera back in 1987.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:17:04.120
The â€“ I've always said that you, you always
seduce people with flavor first and foremost

00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.939
 -- that, once they've taken a bite of even
something that they think they're not gonna

00:17:07.939 --> 00:17:14.100
like, that if you've made it well, then -- and
I always consider that my challenge as a chef

00:17:14.100 --> 00:17:17.199
is â€“ it's that I gotta make it really good
so that they'll go, "Gosh..."

00:17:17.199 --> 00:17:21.260
This is the common thing -- and all the waiters
will tell you this in our restaurant that

00:17:21.260 --> 00:17:24.720
people go, "I don't like Mexican food, but
I really love this."

00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.920
And we all laugh about it, because what they're
eating is really well-prepared Mexican food.

00:17:28.920 --> 00:17:32.360
But when they say they're not liking Mexican
food, probably what they're referring to is

00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:36.850
that Mexican food that I call "Mexican-American
food," because it was really developed in

00:17:36.850 --> 00:17:39.840
the United States.
Of course, you guys probably all know this,

00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:46.690
but almost all of the things that we talk
about as "Mexican," -- things like nachos,

00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:51.930
burritos, fajitas, chimichangas -- all that
sort of stuff was all developed in the United

00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:54.740
States.
And they don't even recognize that stuff in

00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:59.070
Mexico if you -- they've heard about it now,
but they call it "American food," which I

00:17:59.070 --> 00:18:03.391
think is totally hilarious, 'cause you can
go to places now and find ballpark nachos,

00:18:03.391 --> 00:18:06.940
you know with the Number 10 can in the warmer
and they got the pump on the top of it?

00:18:06.940 --> 00:18:11.340
And they buy these really, really crappy tortilla
chips and pump it out.

00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:15.920
You know that sort of gooey, orangish-yellow
stuff?

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:19.490
And they call that "American food," which
I think is pretty hilarious, because that's

00:18:19.490 --> 00:18:23.990
our, that's our export to Mexico is ballpark
nachos. [laughter]

00:18:23.990 --> 00:18:28.810
But it's the -- when people are usually talking
about Mexican food, that's what they're talking

00:18:28.810 --> 00:18:32.790
about either loving or not loving, one or
the other.

00:18:32.790 --> 00:18:40.059
And I found that by just offering them what
sounded like really good food would usually

00:18:40.059 --> 00:18:43.230
make them sort of come, come over into my
camp.

00:18:43.230 --> 00:18:49.060
And then, I did a second thing, and that was
that I told stories around all the food.

00:18:49.060 --> 00:18:54.350
And, of course, I've been able to do that
for a long time now through my books.

00:18:54.350 --> 00:18:59.460
And when we decided to go back and do more
TV shows -- I had done some TV work early

00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:03.870
in my career even before we opened our restaurant.
And then, I decided I really wanted to come

00:19:03.870 --> 00:19:06.580
back to it after we'd been open for about
10 years or so.

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:12.811
But I said, "I don't wanna just stand in a
studio kitchen and tell people what it's like.

00:19:12.811 --> 00:19:16.260
I want to show 'em what it's like."
So I wanted to make sure that half of every

00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:21.890
show could be shot in Mexico on location.
Then, in my sort of translator role, I could

00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:26.020
bring them back to my home kitchen, and that's
where I shoot all the cooking stuff.

00:19:26.020 --> 00:19:30.330
And I could just show you how to make something
that was what I just showed you where it came

00:19:30.330 --> 00:19:33.280
from.
Again, being that, that translator to show

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:36.300
you, "You actually can do this.
It was made by a street vendor in Mexico,

00:19:36.300 --> 00:19:39.230
but if you're gonna do it in your house, this
is what it's going to look like, and I'll

00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.700
step you through each one of the, the bits
of it."

00:19:42.700 --> 00:19:49.020
But, from my perspective, it was, it was never
too hard to, to really get people to come

00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:53.220
to our restaurant and to enjoy our restaurant
 -- number one, because I think I did a really

00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:59.110
good job of training myself to be a good cook,
and secondly, because I put a story around

00:19:59.110 --> 00:20:04.040
everything that just brought it to life.
And to me, the stories are what captivate

00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:08.410
people, because it gives them something to,
to really key into.

00:20:08.410 --> 00:20:13.240
You're not just eating a taco.
You're eating taco that is like the way they

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.310
make it -- the street vendors make it on the
wharf in Vera Cruz.

00:20:16.310 --> 00:20:24.640
And when you see them do that, and they sear
that red chili cured pork in a, on a hot,

00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.420
rolled, steel griddle.
And then, they make this amazing salsa out

00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:34.380
of raw tomatillos that they blend with a little
bit of cilantro and green chili.

00:20:34.380 --> 00:20:38.910
And then, they throw in a little piece of
avocado to kind of make it a little bit creamy.

00:20:38.910 --> 00:20:42.710
And then, they spoon that over that seared...
Suddenly, when you're telling the stories

00:20:42.710 --> 00:20:47.179
like that, then everybody's mouth is watering.
And you could serve them -- I guess -- sauteed

00:20:47.179 --> 00:20:51.300
dog food, but they'd think it was the best
thing that they have ever eaten, because you've

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:54.680
gotten their mouths watering for the whole,
the whole thing.

00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:56.030
Olivia Wu: Story is everything.

00:20:56.030 --> 00:20:57.380
Rick Bayless: Story is everything.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:07.059
Olivia Wu: And, and, and a recipe is really
just a very distilled shorthand for, for saying

00:21:07.059 --> 00:21:12.929
how to make something that has a whole culture
and story behind it.

00:21:12.929 --> 00:21:17.520
I'm, I'm a musician.
You're kind of a musician too, but to me,

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:22.500
I tell people, "When you're looking at a recipe,
it's looking like printed notes on, on a page

00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.241
for music.
There's no music there.

00:21:24.241 --> 00:21:25.990
There's no flavor when you write a recipe."

00:21:25.990 --> 00:21:31.830
Rick Bayless: And I'm gonna steal this from
another author, very famous chef who gave

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.990
a recipe to a person in the restaurant.
Then, they came back, and they said, "Well,

00:21:35.990 --> 00:21:40.140
mine didn't taste like yours."
And he said, "I gave you the recipe. I didn't

00:21:40.140 --> 00:21:44.890
teach you how to cook."
And there is that, that relationship. A recipe

00:21:44.890 --> 00:21:52.850
is like notes on a, on a page.
And you can hand the same sheet music to 50

00:21:52.850 --> 00:21:55.400
different musicians -- and they're all gonna
play it differently.

00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:59.980
They're all gonna interpret it differently.
And in the hands of a musician that's not

00:21:59.980 --> 00:22:03.500
very well trained, then it's not gonna sound
very good.

00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.340
And then, you move up the ladder. And it's
the same thing with the recipe.

00:22:06.340 --> 00:22:11.690
It's just your, your framework, your, your
basic structure of what to put together.

00:22:11.690 --> 00:22:17.210
And that's why -- I've always tried to be
really clear in writing a recipe.

00:22:17.210 --> 00:22:24.250
I don't want it to be too, too simple.
I want to give you as much information as

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:31.880
I think that you can use or need to use.
But, I also can't stand there and walk you

00:22:31.880 --> 00:22:34.740
through everything.
And a lot of times I do teach cooking classes

00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:40.590
 -- as you have -- for many years.
And you, you end up watching people cook your

00:22:40.590 --> 00:22:45.140
food, and you realize how you can interpret
words in many different ways.

00:22:45.140 --> 00:22:46.140
Olivia Wu: Many ways.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:50.910
Rick Bayless: And when it says "medium heat"
 -- to some people -- I've been with -- I

00:22:50.910 --> 00:22:56.860
used to teach a lot at the Culinary Institute
of America up at Greystone and a lot of professional

00:22:56.860 --> 00:23:00.630
chefs, for them, medium heat means "as high
as you can get it."

00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.940
And then, I would get some people who were
very timid cooks who were just starting out

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:08.200
that would be in the class.
And for them, medium heat was hardly on.

00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:12.309
So, I know when you're interpreting these
things -- and some people will say to me -- it's

00:23:12.309 --> 00:23:15.429
like, "Well, it took me a lot longer to cook
that than what you wrote there."

00:23:15.429 --> 00:23:19.270
And it's like, "Well, it's probably because
your interpretation of "medium heat" is different

00:23:19.270 --> 00:23:20.270
than mine.

00:23:20.270 --> 00:23:25.071
Olivia Wu: Yeah. It's, it's, it's the cooking.
It is the story behind, and it's the, it's

00:23:25.071 --> 00:23:28.600
the taste of the authentic food.
So I, I have to ask the question everybody's

00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:29.680
going to ask anyway.

00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.030
Rick Bayless: What is that?

00:23:31.030 --> 00:23:32.630
Olivia Wu: Top Chef Master.

00:23:32.630 --> 00:23:38.210
Rick Bayless: [laughing] It was the big elephant
in the room, was it not?

00:23:38.210 --> 00:23:44.660
Olivia Wu: So, so I remember coming for a
special birthday party in -- to Chicago, and

00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:50.179
it was the, the dinner the night before and
you sat down and you said, "I hope it's okay

00:23:50.179 --> 00:23:53.059
for me to say this. It's one of the hardest
thing I've ever done."

00:23:53.059 --> 00:23:59.330
And you were just finished doing it.
So, so tell, tell how you and Hubert and Michael

00:23:59.330 --> 00:24:05.950
Chiarello laid down the ground rules, how
you made it a more civilized reality show.

00:24:05.950 --> 00:24:10.370
How -- and then, and then what transpired?
Short story. [laughing]

00:24:10.370 --> 00:24:14.650
Rick Bayless: Ooh -- gosh. That's like -- there's
juicy stuff in that one.

00:24:14.650 --> 00:24:21.840
Okay. So, the interesting thing was they had
a hard time getting any chefs of note to say

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.110
"yes" to doing it.
Because, as you know, that every one of those

00:24:25.110 --> 00:24:29.679
reality shows, they can throw you under the
bus really easy just by the way that they

00:24:29.679 --> 00:24:33.309
edit things.
And they, they -- their tape -- we were shooting

00:24:33.309 --> 00:24:36.860
14 cameras almost all the time.
So I mean, there's just like stuff they're

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.660
getting everywhere.
And they said, "Okay, you have to trust us

00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:45.700
on this.
We recognize that you guys have great reputations.

00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:49.250
That's the reason that you're here.
That's the reason we want you here, and we're

00:24:49.250 --> 00:24:53.720
gonna be gentle with you guys."
I mean, if you give us something -- which

00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.140
I think we all realize that Michael Chiarello
gave them a bunch of stuff -- [laughter] -- especially

00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:02.010
toward the end. And that they just didn't
edit that out.

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:05.950
Because he delivered it to them on a silver
platter more than once.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:10.070
And so, they use that stuff.
But if you didn't give it to them, they wouldn't

00:25:10.070 --> 00:25:14.960
just take snippets of stuff and put it together
to make it seem like that you were not the

00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:17.980
person that you are.
And so, I really appreciated that.

00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:23.190
And it really was about cooking.
And it really was about people who were at

00:25:23.190 --> 00:25:31.160
the top of their profession showing you how
they got there, but in the craziest challenges.

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.520
I mean, it was the hardest thing I've ever
done in my life, because you never -- well,

00:25:35.520 --> 00:25:39.170
like, every reality show, they, they wore
you out.

00:25:39.170 --> 00:25:43.040
That's the whole idea is that they just keep
you going all day long. There's never -- it's

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:45.100
shot all at one time; there's never a day
off.

00:25:45.100 --> 00:25:49.060
And you're just dead, because they usually
get back to your hotel and at like -- well,

00:25:49.060 --> 00:25:53.650
you didn't have to live together, thank goodness.
Well, we got back to our hotel between 11

00:25:53.650 --> 00:25:56.860
and 12 every night.
Our call was usually 6:00 or 6:30 the next

00:25:56.860 --> 00:25:58.700
morning.
So you never had a full night's sleep.

00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:02.030
You almost never got a full meal.
Sometimes you're just stuffin' stuff in your

00:26:02.030 --> 00:26:04.430
mouth.
The kitchen was always at a hundred degrees.

00:26:04.430 --> 00:26:08.020
So you were always working in these really,
really hot conditions.

00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:10.900
And then, they would always start and stop
and start and stop.

00:26:10.900 --> 00:26:13.630
They'd say, "Okay, now we're going to do the
challenge -- no, we're not going to do the

00:26:13.630 --> 00:26:15.370
challenge -- okay, move over here. We're gonna
move you."

00:26:15.370 --> 00:26:19.520
So you're always constantly in flux, which
is another way that they kind of wear you

00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:23.720
down in all of that stuff.
And then, of course, you know about the reality

00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:27.880
shows -- there's always an open bar.
There's always an open bar.

00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.950
There's always booze everywhere you turn,
okay?

00:26:30.950 --> 00:26:36.810
So you are just open to drink as much as you
want and make as big a fool as you -- out

00:26:36.810 --> 00:26:42.080
of yourself as you possibly can.
But the thing is, with the chefs that they

00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:47.250
got for the first season of "Top Chef Masters"
 -- we're, we're all smart enough not to make

00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.280
fools out of ourselves.
We knew how much that we had to lose, so who

00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.690
wants to lose?
So they kept doing this thing.

00:26:52.690 --> 00:26:56.760
Oh, you know, when we would stand in front
of those judges and they would tell us what

00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:59.610
they thought of our, our dishes, we would
go back and forth with them.

00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:04.670
That took never less than two hours we had
to stand on our feet in one spot.

00:27:04.670 --> 00:27:09.549
And oftentimes, it would go toward three hours.
And then, we would have to go back into that

00:27:09.549 --> 00:27:13.450
kitchen, we'd sit around that table -- and
you notice that every time when we went back

00:27:13.450 --> 00:27:18.559
into that table, they had it loaded with booze.
Because they wanted us to sit there and just

00:27:18.559 --> 00:27:22.660
drink ourselves silly, because that was always
an hour -- an hour and a half -- while the

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.669
judges deliberated.
And then, we would have to go back and stand

00:27:25.669 --> 00:27:29.110
in front of them.
And then, they really wanted us to be sort

00:27:29.110 --> 00:27:32.720
of loose, can you say.
So we would sit down at that table, and no

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.169
one would drink.
And then, the producers'd come over and go,

00:27:35.169 --> 00:27:38.140
"How about a beer?
How about a --" You know, it's like "How about

00:27:38.140 --> 00:27:40.070
some wine? We'll open it for you. We'll pour
it."

00:27:40.070 --> 00:27:41.919
"No" -- it's like, "No, I'm fine. No, I'm
fine."

00:27:41.919 --> 00:27:45.260
We'd all sit there and go, "Oh, what are we
going to do with these guys, because they

00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:49.081
won't give us what we. we wanted."
But then they began to get into it and go,

00:27:49.081 --> 00:27:52.919
"There's nobody's doing any backbiting.
Everybody's helping each other."

00:27:52.919 --> 00:27:58.180
It's like, "This is not a typical reality
show," which actually, I think turned out

00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.340
to be its term in the end.
Because it was -- it really was -- you were

00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:04.220
seeing people at the top of their profession
and how they got there.

00:28:04.220 --> 00:28:09.440
And what kind of dishes we created.
Now, I have been a judge on regular "Top Chef".

00:28:09.440 --> 00:28:13.049
And there's -- those young people have nothing
to lose.

00:28:13.049 --> 00:28:14.140
They're just out there trying to make a name
for themselves.

00:28:14.140 --> 00:28:18.060
And some of them are good cooks, and some
of them aren't good cooks.

00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:22.710
But a lot of the food, because it's done under
such duress, a lot of the food's not very

00:28:22.710 --> 00:28:26.740
well seasoned; it's not very good.
It might look good, and you might say, "Oh,

00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:30.799
it would be wonderful to be a judge on Top
Chef," -- not really. [laughter]

00:28:30.799 --> 00:28:34.690
No. I think maybe you'd like to do takeout
or something like that.

00:28:34.690 --> 00:28:37.640
Because sometimes it's just not very good
what they produce.

00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:40.270
And, in, in our case, sometimes it wasn't
as great either.

00:28:40.270 --> 00:28:45.799
But I think what you saw was people who have
cooked for so many years that knew the shortcuts

00:28:45.799 --> 00:28:50.700
through things that we could actually put
quite delicious dishes together under -- I

00:28:50.700 --> 00:28:54.150
mean, if they knew it was going to take you
an hour to make a dish, they'd give you half

00:28:54.150 --> 00:28:57.150
an hour.
So you really, really had to work quickly,

00:28:57.150 --> 00:29:01.669
but also smart.
Like the very first -- the first quick-fire

00:29:01.669 --> 00:29:05.630
challenge that I did?
And I didn't realize how fast 30 minutes was

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.260
gonna go.
And I was like -- I looked up at the clock

00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:12.890
on the wall, and it said "19," and I didn't
know whether that was "19 minutes to go" or

00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:17.150
"19 minutes into the 30-minute thing."
And I yelled at the producer, and I said,

00:29:17.150 --> 00:29:20.910
"Is that 19 minutes to go?" She said, "No."
[laughing]

00:29:20.910 --> 00:29:23.910
And I was like, "Whoa! I got 11 minutes to
finish this dish."

00:29:23.910 --> 00:29:28.410
And I didn't even have it on the stove yet.
And so, I'm like -- I'm thinkin' about what

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:32.990
I can do, and I remember -- the geeky guy
that I am -- that I watched one of these training

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.929
videos that came with my Vitamix blender.
And there was like -- yeah, I am. I am one

00:29:37.929 --> 00:29:42.660
of those geeky guys, so.
I went to â€“ I, I thought, "There was somebody

00:29:42.660 --> 00:29:48.110
on that video that just turned the blender
up high, and the friction that the blades

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:53.690
caused actually brought it to a simmer." [laughter]
So I'm thinking, "That's my only hope in this

00:29:53.690 --> 00:29:55.580
thing."
And I had all these ingredients in this blender

00:29:55.580 --> 00:29:58.160
jar.
And so, I just turned it on. It made incredible

00:29:58.160 --> 00:30:01.480
racket.
But there I am just praying that it's going

00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:03.740
to get hot in the blender.
And you know what?

00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:07.059
That training video was right, and I did really
well. [laughter]

00:30:07.059 --> 00:30:11.650
But I realized about five minutes into that
there were so many ways that I could look

00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:16.490
like such a fool on that show, which I think
is one of the reasons it was such a really,

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:18.410
really hard thing for me to do.

00:30:18.410 --> 00:30:24.420
Olivia Wu: But, but you were the one who said,
"Nothing negative -- we're not gonna go into

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:31.260
negatives and backbiting.
A winners' purse. Or all of our purses will

00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:34.230
go to charity."
You were the one who --

00:30:34.230 --> 00:30:36.340
Rick Bayless: No, they were. They said that
from the very beginning.

00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:40.900
So, "You are, you are playing for charity."
And you weren't really playing for your reputation.

00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:47.610
I mean we always laugh, because when we would
walk away from the judge's table, you know

00:30:47.610 --> 00:30:51.120
how they always say on regular Top Chef, "Pack
your knives and go home?"

00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:56.240
So we would always say, "Pack your knives
and go back to your extremely successful life."

00:30:56.240 --> 00:30:58.410
[laughter]
Because that was what -- as we were walking

00:30:58.410 --> 00:31:01.799
out â€“ because it's like, all those chefs
are really successful chefs.

00:31:01.799 --> 00:31:05.140
So, they're "Pack your knives."
Yes, "and go back and do what you do really

00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:09.151
good and you've become really famous for."
So, it, it was that kind of a thing.

00:31:09.151 --> 00:31:14.450
And nobody was taking it terribly seriously.
Everybody had to lose at some point along,

00:31:14.450 --> 00:31:17.820
along the line there.
But it was really -- I have to say, working

00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:22.240
with those chefs -- they're amazing.
That was the coolest thing about the whole,

00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:27.500
the whole thing was cooking right beside all
those chefs for all those days.

00:31:27.500 --> 00:31:32.530
And when we went back to start with the semifinals
thing, and the first thing they ask us to

00:31:32.530 --> 00:31:38.100
do was to make a dish that you consider to
be like a perfect expression of your cooking,

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:42.340
a signature dish, whatever it might be.
And they allowed us â€“ they, they told us

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:47.070
ahead of time that they, that they would have
the ingredients for us there, so it didn't

00:31:47.070 --> 00:31:49.600
seem like a challenge at all.
We couldn't figure out what was going on.

00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:52.640
And then, they said, "We'll give you two-and-a-half
hours to do it."

00:31:52.640 --> 00:31:55.010
It's like "two and a half?" So, it was just
glorious.

00:31:55.010 --> 00:31:58.460
Two-and-a-half hours -- we were chatting,
we were watching each other cook, we were

00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:01.860
learning things from each other.
And then, they said, "Okay, now.

00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:05.850
Plate it, and sit down at the table and share
it with all the other chefs."

00:32:05.850 --> 00:32:09.419
And so, one by one, we finished all our dishes
and we shared it.

00:32:09.419 --> 00:32:12.921
And it's like, "Wow! This is cool. We're really
enjoying it."

00:32:12.921 --> 00:32:15.870
It was the most glorious moment of the whole
thing for me.

00:32:15.870 --> 00:32:19.120
And then, they got us up from the table, and
they said, "Okay, now.

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.510
You're gonna have to make another one of the
chef's dishes.

00:32:22.510 --> 00:32:25.789
And it was like -- and then, we all swallowed
very hard.

00:32:25.789 --> 00:32:29.950
Because we had been patting each other on
the back, "Wow! How do you get this flavor?

00:32:29.950 --> 00:32:35.370
This is so beautiful. This is so incredible."
And then, we were asked to, to create that,

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:39.970
not ever having done that before.
And so, it turned from the most glorious moment

00:32:39.970 --> 00:32:45.260
to the scariest moment in the world.
Because nobody knew what to do.

00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.360
And we were all talking, and it's like, "Are
we supposed to do an homage to the dish?

00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:50.799
Are we supposed to do the dish the way we
would do it?

00:32:50.799 --> 00:32:54.480
Are we supposed to change it?
Are we supposed to say, 'Well, my version

00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:58.261
would actually be better.'" [laughter]
That would be a slap in the face of the other

00:32:58.261 --> 00:32:59.840
chef.
And we didn't know how to do it.

00:32:59.840 --> 00:33:02.890
And that was really â€“ that was the hard
part of the thing is to decide how you were

00:33:02.890 --> 00:33:03.890
gonna do it.

00:33:03.890 --> 00:33:04.890
Olivia Wu: And you didâ€¦

00:33:04.890 --> 00:33:09.980
Rick Bayless: I chose to do an homage completely
to what Michael Chiarello had done with some

00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:13.600
cuello -- and I cooked in a straight Italian
style.

00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:17.000
I mean, not as good as Michael Chiarello,
but I've cooked a bunch of Italian food in

00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.160
my life.
And I thought, "I think I can, I can get it

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:23.070
fairly close."
And everybody was really good about helping

00:33:23.070 --> 00:33:27.440
the other chef to kind of know some of the
tricks, but then they were on their own, because

00:33:27.440 --> 00:33:30.442
once you start cooking, man -- you start cookin'.
[chuckles] There's never any time.

00:33:30.442 --> 00:33:33.740
And then, we only had an hour-and-a-half to
recreate their dish.

00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.830
And so, they had given us two-and-a-half to
do our own and an hour-and-a-half to do somebody

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:38.830
else's.

00:33:38.830 --> 00:33:45.309
Olivia Wu: So celebrity chefs â€“ and all
of a sudden in our culture in about 20 years,

00:33:45.309 --> 00:33:47.809
chefs have, have risen to --

00:33:47.809 --> 00:33:49.970
Rick Bayless: -- we've come out of the kitchen.

00:33:49.970 --> 00:33:54.101
Olivia Wu: We've come out of the kitchen.
What should celebrity chefs be doing that,

00:33:54.101 --> 00:34:01.429
that really helps the cause of good food in
America -- healthy food in America -- or maybe

00:34:01.429 --> 00:34:07.340
that's my agenda.
But what else, now that you have this platform,

00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:09.679
what should be done -- what would you like
seen done?

00:34:09.679 --> 00:34:14.030
Rick Bayless: The, the one thing that I always
think that we as chefs have the opportunity

00:34:14.030 --> 00:34:20.970
to do â€“ and, and I cooked the last state
dinner at the White House. And do you know

00:34:20.970 --> 00:34:25.820
that, up until this administration, the chef
has never been introduced at the White House

00:34:25.820 --> 00:34:29.490
at one of these things, okay?
They don't even acknowledge that a chef exists,

00:34:29.490 --> 00:34:32.360
that the food comes from the kitchen, and
there it is.

00:34:32.360 --> 00:34:40.160
And when Cris Comerford was put into the position
of White House chef -- first of all, it was

00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:45.560
the first woman to be there. Suddenly people
were thinking about chefs as like, contributing

00:34:45.560 --> 00:34:48.530
something.
And that, actually, there's not only food

00:34:48.530 --> 00:34:53.599
at the White House, but the administration
actually has some things to say about food

00:34:53.599 --> 00:34:56.260
in our country.
And so suddenly, we were starting to think

00:34:56.260 --> 00:35:01.340
about the administration in relationship to
food, not just in big agriculture.

00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:06.640
So it's -- we were putting something that
we can relate to more as human beings in the

00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:10.980
spotlight at the White House.
And now that they have done for the first

00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:16.160
time -- invited chefs to cook at the White
House for these big events like that -- they're

00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:21.920
introducing, not the invited chef first, but
the chef of the White House first, then the

00:35:21.920 --> 00:35:26.620
pastry chef of the White House, then the invited
chef because those first two people are the

00:35:26.620 --> 00:35:31.290
ones that actually make that event happen.
We just are there to make our food and get

00:35:31.290 --> 00:35:34.349
the flavors right and all that.
They produce the event, because they know

00:35:34.349 --> 00:35:37.680
how to do it.
And there's so much protocol.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:40.050
And they have to, they have to know that protocol
and do it.

00:35:40.050 --> 00:35:47.200
But I think that -- what I experienced there
at the White House being introduced by Mrs.

00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:53.210
Obama to all the people that had come to the
state dinner and the President of Mexico and

00:35:53.210 --> 00:36:00.290
his wife, it gives us the opportunity to talk
about things that are important to us.

00:36:00.290 --> 00:36:03.270
And every chef has different things that are
important to them.

00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:09.790
My -- I'm really interested in food as an
expression of culture and food as a way of

00:36:09.790 --> 00:36:12.690
bringing people together.
That's really important to me.

00:36:12.690 --> 00:36:17.010
So I have a platform where I can talk about
that now.

00:36:17.010 --> 00:36:20.990
Twenty-five years ago it would be really hard
to have done anything like that.

00:36:20.990 --> 00:36:25.700
Twenty-five years ago, if people were clamoring
to be known, they were usually clamoring to

00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:32.140
be known as having the most exotic food or
the most expensive food or the most elaborate

00:36:32.140 --> 00:36:35.680
food.
Well, we have really gone past that now.

00:36:35.680 --> 00:36:44.590
And many chefs choose to use their platform
as a way of connecting people at home with

00:36:44.590 --> 00:36:48.840
people producing the food.
So like, we have a fabulous farmer's market

00:36:48.840 --> 00:36:53.690
 -- our big, big farmer's market in Chicago
 -- that's Green City Market.

00:36:53.690 --> 00:37:00.910
And we -- I'm on the board of that market.
And we are a 501c3, because we have a huge

00:37:00.910 --> 00:37:04.170
educational component.
Every week, one or two chefs is out there

00:37:04.170 --> 00:37:06.990
teaching people how to work with the farmer's
produce.

00:37:06.990 --> 00:37:13.930
So we're connecting the, the everyday cooks
with the farm -- farmers and their produce

00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:19.270
and helping them to understand how to use
more of it in their everyday cooking.

00:37:19.270 --> 00:37:25.000
Then, there's other chefs that tend to go
more toward the political end of things using

00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:32.160
their platform to say, to say things as, as
important as working with school lunch programs,

00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:35.100
as working with farm bills -- all of those
things.

00:37:35.100 --> 00:37:39.960
They're all really important.
I'm just thankful that, as a professional

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:46.800
cook, I have the opportunity to get people's
ear, and to talk about things that are really

00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.460
meaningful.
Now, the one thing that I think you find with

00:37:49.460 --> 00:37:58.609
most chefs -- perhaps not Gordon Ramsay, but
many chefs -- is that they're incredibly passionate

00:37:58.609 --> 00:38:03.560
people.
They believe very strongly in things that

00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:09.980
root you to the earth.
And to have the opportunity for those passionate

00:38:09.980 --> 00:38:17.020
individuals with such great convictions to
be able to talk to people I think is just

00:38:17.020 --> 00:38:21.050
an incredible gift, 'cause we haven't had
that so much in the past.

00:38:21.050 --> 00:38:26.640
People that have talked about food have either
been sort of big producers of food or -- and

00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:31.630
their big advertising budgets, or on the flip
side, it was people that wrote cookbooks that

00:38:31.630 --> 00:38:35.431
were home cooks.
And they didn't understand sort of that, that

00:38:35.431 --> 00:38:40.830
way of tying from -- all the way from the
farm to the table -- which, as professional

00:38:40.830 --> 00:38:42.800
chefs now, we do all the time.

00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:48.470
Olivia Wu: I know we both feel we love to
make food, make it authentically, and translate

00:38:48.470 --> 00:38:54.450
it, and, and serve people.
But I think you also feel as I do that it's

00:38:54.450 --> 00:38:59.940
very important for people to own their own
food, to be connected and grounded.

00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.951
And food is one of the -- the major way to,
to do it.

00:39:02.951 --> 00:39:07.840
I mean, we, we want people to know how to
cook, how to cook from scratch, how to own

00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:13.180
their own health.
And I know you were a founding member of Chef's

00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.180
Collaborative.

00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.440
Rick Bayless: Chef's Collaborative -- working
on â€“ working with chefs primarily.

00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:21.619
Just it's an organization that just works
with chefs to train them in how to work, connect

00:39:21.619 --> 00:39:26.300
to their local growers, how to take that message
from the local growers through their restaurant

00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:30.619
kitchens all the way to the guests that come
into their restaurants and to be a support

00:39:30.619 --> 00:39:33.590
 -- an educational support basically -- for
the chef community.

00:39:33.590 --> 00:39:43.119
And now, we said this -- I was at this ideation
conference one time with, with the chefs -- or,

00:39:43.119 --> 00:39:46.830
it was more like a board meeting with the
Chef's Collaborative board.

00:39:46.830 --> 00:39:52.190
And we were talking about like, "What would,
what would have to happen for this organization

00:39:52.190 --> 00:39:57.630
to become obsolete?" And you know, we're moving
toward it at a pretty fast rate, and I'm really

00:39:57.630 --> 00:40:02.780
happy about that.
If you go to any restaurant in Chicago worth

00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:10.160
its salt, you'll see the farm names, you'll
see where the, where the inspiration for the

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.320
dishes are coming from, something incredibly
seasonal.

00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:20.800
This year, there are so many restaurants that
are hosting dinners at farms, and they like

00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:25.720
rent a school bus or whatever.
They take the guests for that dinner -- their

00:40:25.720 --> 00:40:30.520
restaurant guests for that dinner out to the
farm. They set up tables out there.

00:40:30.520 --> 00:40:32.790
They finish or they cook the food whatever
it might be.

00:40:32.790 --> 00:40:38.800
They always get local microbrews or craft
beers or something like that that's also very

00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.130
much of our place.
And they have these amazing meals.

00:40:42.130 --> 00:40:44.910
There's so many of them, I can't even keep
up with them.

00:40:44.910 --> 00:40:49.810
I think at last count, there was probably
45 of those kind of just "dinners on a farm"

00:40:49.810 --> 00:40:52.869
from local restaurants.
And you just, you just laugh and think, "You

00:40:52.869 --> 00:40:55.630
know, even five years ago, nobody even talked
about doing anything like that."

00:40:55.630 --> 00:41:01.859
But now if I won't go into a restaurant and
see all these names of all the farms on there,

00:41:01.859 --> 00:41:04.270
I just -- I don't even know what to make of
it.

00:41:04.270 --> 00:41:07.770
I think, "Are they just buying frozen food
and just heating it up for us?" Because if

00:41:07.770 --> 00:41:10.859
you're gonna work with the farmers, you're
probably going to say something about it on

00:41:10.859 --> 00:41:13.260
your menu.
So I'm really, really happy about it.

00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:18.130
Olivia Wu: And ideally, that means it's inspiring
the diners to go to their farmer's market

00:41:18.130 --> 00:41:19.160
and, and buy food and cook it for themselves
occasionally.

00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.200
Rick Bayless: Absolutely. Absolutely.

00:41:20.200 --> 00:41:23.000
Olivia Wu: Occasionally. Yeah. I'm gonna let
you at him.

00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:33.080
Rick Bayless: Okay, but before that, I have
to tell you a story about Olivia, okay?

00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.080
Olivia Wu: Wait, we didn't agree to this.

00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.810
Rick Bayless: [laughing] Olivia is just -- she
likes to throw parties too, okay?

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:44.210
And Olivia has had a -- this beautiful Chinese
New Year thing forever and ever and ever.

00:41:44.210 --> 00:41:51.550
I always look so forward to it.
But one of those years, my mother was in town

00:41:51.550 --> 00:41:54.270
visiting.
And Liv says, "Just bring her on out."

00:41:54.270 --> 00:41:59.720
And, of course, if you hang around chefs very
much, you know that we have like real motley

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.480
groups of friends that kind of come together
and we all just sort of accept each other

00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:07.010
and it's really fun.
And as I said, it's like a passionate group

00:42:07.010 --> 00:42:11.910
of people.
And so, we're at her house â€“ north -- one

00:42:11.910 --> 00:42:15.920
of the northern suburbs of Chicago -- and
we're havin' just this -- starting to have

00:42:15.920 --> 00:42:21.060
all this amazing things.
Of course, when we arrive at the given moment,

00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:24.550
Olivia's not usually quite ready for us to
be there at that time.

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:29.430
So we are all trying to help her out in the
kitchen and doing all this crazy stuff.

00:42:29.430 --> 00:42:35.940
And at one moment during the -- most of the
things â€“ the meals that we would have, things

00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:41.330
would sort of just spin out of control. And
my favorite memory ever -- ever, ever -- of

00:42:41.330 --> 00:42:48.760
having one of these parties at Olivia's house
is -- was that we were all singing camp songs

00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.820
at one point -- like children's camp songs.

00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:51.820
Olivia Wu: Chinese New Year.

00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:55.710
Rick Bayless: And all of a sudden, and all
of a sudden, we're not paying any attention,

00:42:55.710 --> 00:43:01.430
but we haven't finished our food yet.
All of a sudden, I notice that her dog is

00:43:01.430 --> 00:43:06.480
eating out of my plate right next to it, and
my mother is sitting across from me looking

00:43:06.480 --> 00:43:10.140
at this thing with great horror.
And I think my mother is never gonna come

00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:15.900
back and visit me and my friends again.
But it was the most glorious moment that I've

00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.870
ever had at any party.
And I always think about that -- singing camp

00:43:19.870 --> 00:43:23.820
songs and watching the dog eat my food off
of my plate. [laughter]

00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:32.240
Olivia Wu: Okay, Barney. Kudos to Barney.
So yes -- any questions, please come to the

00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:36.470
mic if you have a question for Rick.

00:43:36.470 --> 00:43:37.470
[pause]

00:43:37.470 --> 00:43:38.470
Cynthia.

00:43:38.470 --> 00:43:40.540
Cynthia: This is really just a sort of simple
question.

00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:43.260
Well, two simple questions.
First is, when are you going to open a restaurant

00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:51.360
in San Francisco?
And the second one is, where are you eating

00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.360
tonight?

00:43:52.360 --> 00:43:53.360
Rick Bayless: Oh, I'm eating at Manresa tonight.
And I'm really excited about that. I've never

00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:57.470
been there.
And I've read so much about it and I'm very

00:43:57.470 --> 00:44:01.770
excited, because I share a lot of the same
philosophies with the chef there and so I'm

00:44:01.770 --> 00:44:02.770
really excited to see it.

00:44:02.770 --> 00:44:03.970
Olivia Wu: And we're going to the farm beforehand.

00:44:03.970 --> 00:44:06.580
Rick Bayless: And we're going to the farm
beforehand, so that's gonna be really cool.

00:44:06.580 --> 00:44:08.060
So we'll see where the food comes from.

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.150
Olivia Wu: Yeah, the dedicated farmer, biodynamic
farmer for David Kinch.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:11.880
Rick Bayless: So that's, that's going to be
super-cool.

00:44:11.880 --> 00:44:16.020
And when am I gonna open a restaurant in San
Francisco?

00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:19.460
Olivia Wu: I'd like to know too.

00:44:19.460 --> 00:44:20.460
&gt;&gt; [laughter]

00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:25.070
Rick Bayless: Well, I don't -- you probably
shouldn't hold your breath.

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:29.430
I, I don't tend to be a person that proliferates
easily.

00:44:29.430 --> 00:44:34.520
So, you know, we opened Frontera Grill in
1987.

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:39.030
And then, our second restaurant, we opened
next door to it in 1989.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:42.810
It took us all the way until last year to
take the next store front over.

00:44:42.810 --> 00:44:47.720
I said, "At this glacial movement, we will
all be all the way out to Lincoln Park in

00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:54.950
about middle of the next century."
But we do tend to kind of go slowly through

00:44:54.950 --> 00:44:57.810
things.
But if somebody from San Francisco said, "I

00:44:57.810 --> 00:45:01.670
want to collaborate with you on something,"
I might think about that. So, pass the word

00:45:01.670 --> 00:45:10.150
around to all your friends. Another question
 -- now, when I was at the Google campus in

00:45:10.150 --> 00:45:15.310
Chicago -- much, much, much smaller than this
one -- they were all sitting there posting

00:45:15.310 --> 00:45:20.260
their questions online and voting them up.
Now, I come here, and I don't know quite what

00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.510
to do with this live question and answer session.

00:45:22.510 --> 00:45:23.510
&gt;&gt; [Laughter]

00:45:23.510 --> 00:45:27.560
Male Questioner: Hi. How's it going?
I was wondering how you like to see the restaurant

00:45:27.560 --> 00:45:32.970
industry evolve in the next ten years.
I used to work as a cook at a kitchen in New

00:45:32.970 --> 00:45:35.590
York.
And I thought it was really hard to strike

00:45:35.590 --> 00:45:40.740
a good balance between life and work and health
insurance and was wondering if you have any

00:45:40.740 --> 00:45:41.740
thoughts on that.

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.349
Rick Bayless: Well, yes. I do.
Our restaurants have never been open more

00:45:45.349 --> 00:45:50.150
than five days a week since we started, and
that's one of the ways that you do that.

00:45:50.150 --> 00:45:57.270
I, I feel like that -- you know, we have,
we have never spent less of our income on

00:45:57.270 --> 00:46:03.589
food than at this point in, in our history.
And, I think that sort of says -- because

00:46:03.589 --> 00:46:08.420
we'll spend money on what we value.
Now, in San Francisco, my experience over

00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:12.180
the last several days is that there's a lot
of people are out there that are willing to

00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:16.030
spend a greater portion of their income because
they value the food.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:22.109
And I'm really, really happy to see that.
We have turned the tide that people say, "Good

00:46:22.109 --> 00:46:26.400
food is elitist food."
Because that's still out there really easily.

00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:33.540
Even one of the top commentators on, on National
Public Radio about three weeks ago said something

00:46:33.540 --> 00:46:38.750
about the Dupont Circle Farmers Market being
"the overpriced place for the rich people

00:46:38.750 --> 00:46:45.920
to" -- when he used "overpriced" to refer
to the beautiful produce at that market, I

00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:50.990
was a little taken aback, because actually
what they're charging for that is probably

00:46:50.990 --> 00:46:56.230
the right amount to charge for it.
And it's probably the accurate reflection

00:46:56.230 --> 00:46:59.760
of what it takes to make that beautiful food.
So people have to kind of come along with

00:46:59.760 --> 00:47:04.820
us.
But I do think that, with the success of -- and

00:47:04.820 --> 00:47:09.640
the platform of a lot of great chefs that
are willing -- like our restaurant â€“ to,

00:47:09.640 --> 00:47:15.990
to work with the local sources and to pay
the right amount of money for it, and then,

00:47:15.990 --> 00:47:19.830
to treat the staff in a way that you're not
workin' 80 hours a week.

00:47:19.830 --> 00:47:25.201
And most of our staff, nobody really is there
for more than 45 hours a week, which means

00:47:25.201 --> 00:47:29.510
that -- and I always, when I interview people,
I always want to ask what they do outside

00:47:29.510 --> 00:47:33.690
the kitchen, because if they're only just
a kitchen person, they're not gonna bring

00:47:33.690 --> 00:47:37.680
much to us.
They're not gonna say, "Oh, yeah. I was out

00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:41.950
doing" -- whatever hobby that they do -- "and
it just occurred to me," because that -- as

00:47:41.950 --> 00:47:46.190
you guys know -- you get really creative when
you suddenly do something completely different,

00:47:46.190 --> 00:47:50.300
and you figure things out.
And so, I think it's really important to have

00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:53.251
a balance.
And I always think back to sort of the way

00:47:53.251 --> 00:47:59.510
that a lot of, of the European kitchens are
run where they're not -- they work long days,

00:47:59.510 --> 00:48:03.140
but they don't work seven days a week.
And then, they get a lot more time off.

00:48:03.140 --> 00:48:09.760
I think all of that's really important.
And as the value of food goes up in our culture,

00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.960
I think we'll see a lot of the things that
you're talking about and that you reacted

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:17.050
to.
It's like, "Yeah, I can't stand it."

00:48:17.050 --> 00:48:21.430
When we opened up our restaurant 23 years
ago, I said, "I'm in this for life, and I

00:48:21.430 --> 00:48:25.030
want a balanced life."
I want to be able to do something that I can

00:48:25.030 --> 00:48:28.780
be excited to go to every day, not find it
a chore.

00:48:28.780 --> 00:48:31.880
And the only way we could do that was to be
open for five days a week.

00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:37.060
Olivia Wu: Well, and so enlightened of you.
I mean, from the getgo, you established â€“ there's

00:48:37.060 --> 00:48:43.859
profit-sharing in your restaurant.
Rick and Deann and Lanie take the staff to

00:48:43.859 --> 00:48:48.730
Mexico every year.
Part of the staff -- not all 130 of them.

00:48:48.730 --> 00:48:53.869
And, and trips to Japan. I mean, there are
rewards.

00:48:53.869 --> 00:48:56.460
You know the families of every worker in there,
actually.

00:48:56.460 --> 00:49:01.480
Rick Bayless: Yeah, we have -- I can't tell
you right out the exact number, but there's

00:49:01.480 --> 00:49:05.359
six or eight people that have been on our
staff for over 20 years.

00:49:05.359 --> 00:49:09.970
And we have -- 60 percent of our staff has
been there for over six years.

00:49:09.970 --> 00:49:11.960
Olivia Wu: It's so against the industry average.

00:49:11.960 --> 00:49:16.119
Rick Bayless: So not -- but it's because I
think we offer kind of balanced place to work

00:49:16.119 --> 00:49:19.480
and you don't have to feel like you have to
work 80 hours a week and stuff like that.

00:49:19.480 --> 00:49:23.121
It's hard work, but a lot of people like that
kind of work.

00:49:23.121 --> 00:49:25.820
I love the physicality of it.
And I was headed down an academic path and

00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:31.839
I was in graduate school and all of a sudden,
I realized, "I could never do this for very

00:49:31.839 --> 00:49:33.740
long."
I mean, like a lot of people get into the

00:49:33.740 --> 00:49:35.900
kitchen, they go, "I could never do this for
my whole life."

00:49:35.900 --> 00:49:38.180
I had to go back to the kitchen, because I
couldn't do a desk job for the rest of my

00:49:38.180 --> 00:49:40.829
life.
And I knew that.

00:49:40.829 --> 00:49:47.190
And all of a sudden my friends were all graduating
and getting these assistant professor jobs

00:49:47.190 --> 00:49:51.670
in places I didn't want to live, sitting in
desks that I didn't want to have to be my

00:49:51.670 --> 00:49:54.650
life.
And so, I realized that what I need to do

00:49:54.650 --> 00:49:58.900
is take my love for -- and the knowledge I
had gained in all of my studies -- and apply

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:07.920
that to the, to the thing I loved, which was
Mexico and its food.

00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:10.510
Q I got your book. I think "Mexican Every
Day."

00:50:10.510 --> 00:50:11.510
Rick Bayless: Yes.

00:50:11.510 --> 00:50:12.510
Q One of the first two books.
And I just want to say it's fantastic.

00:50:12.510 --> 00:50:13.510
Rick Bayless: How nice. Thank you.

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:20.240
Q My question is, I had a, I had a boss once
who was Japanese -- from Japan -- and working

00:50:20.240 --> 00:50:22.250
with me.
And we would go to sushi, and I one day asked

00:50:22.250 --> 00:50:26.520
him, "What's the thing that you see when you
go to sushi restaurants -- that you see Americans

00:50:26.520 --> 00:50:30.630
or foreigners do -- that you just can't understand
and you think takes away from the food?" And

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:35.050
he had an answer.
It was, "drinking diet coke with sushi and,

00:50:35.050 --> 00:50:40.880
and filling the, the soy sauce cup up to the
brim."

00:50:40.880 --> 00:50:45.500
It was painful to see.
What would you say about Mexican food that

00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:46.500
you think that Americans do -- other people
do -- that you think that either detracts

00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:51.960
from the food or I guess could make it better
for Americans, but -- that sort of might make

00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:54.170
you or Mexicans sort of skin kind of crawl?

00:50:54.170 --> 00:50:57.380
Rick Bayless: Well, it's really interesting
because the first thing that comes to my mind

00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:02.020
when you ask the question is dairy products.
Because it's all about melted.

00:51:02.020 --> 00:51:07.230
People say that to me all the time, "Oh, I
love Mexican cheese â€“ food -- food -- I

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:09.339
love all that melted cheese." [laughter]
Well, you know they have almost no melted

00:51:09.339 --> 00:51:13.980
cheese in the food in Mexico.
So, that is -- they use a dried cheese that's

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:17.660
more like a Romano or Parmesan and they put
a little sprinkling of that over, but it's

00:51:17.660 --> 00:51:21.290
just that flavor punch.
So the dairy products, meaning a lot of sour

00:51:21.290 --> 00:51:27.800
cream and, and melted cheese -- whenever I
see that, I think immediately it's an Americanized

00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:31.260
kind of dish.
There's that one dish that was developed in

00:51:31.260 --> 00:51:36.330
the 50s in Mexico City called "enchiladas
suizas," which is a creamy sauce and then

00:51:36.330 --> 00:51:40.800
there's melted cheese over the enchiladas.
And that was developed, interestingly enough,

00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:46.380
by a person in Mexico City but working at
a place that was owned by Americans.

00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:50.520
Now, this guy had immigrated there and he
sort of settled in Mexico City.

00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:56.280
But you can almost see the relationship between
that one dish with the melted cheese and,

00:51:56.280 --> 00:51:59.710
and the relationship to the American side
of things.

00:51:59.710 --> 00:52:06.030
But, that, that's it.
And the whole idea of drinking margaritas.

00:52:06.030 --> 00:52:08.940
I mean, you know, also margaritas were probably
developed in Mexico.

00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:12.790
There's not an exact story.
But they were probably developed in Mexico

00:52:12.790 --> 00:52:17.520
for Americans that wouldn't drink tequila
the way that Mexico drinks tequila.

00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:22.750
And only recently have margaritas taken off
in Mexico -- only recently.

00:52:22.750 --> 00:52:26.550
And that came because a lot of the Mexicans
went to the resort towns, which are really

00:52:26.550 --> 00:52:30.369
catering to Americans, and they learned to
drink margaritas there.

00:52:30.369 --> 00:52:33.810
And then, they came back and asked their restaurants
or whatever where they lived to make margaritas

00:52:33.810 --> 00:52:36.080
for them.
But drinking margaritas through a meal or

00:52:36.080 --> 00:52:37.800
something like that seems a kind of odd thing
to me.

00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:47.960
It sort of echoes the diet coke with sushi.

00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.230
&gt;&gt; [pause]

00:52:49.230 --> 00:52:54.170
Q I first want to preface this by thanking
you for your contributions to the world of

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:58.410
food and the things that you do outside of
just the shows and the books, but your contributions

00:52:58.410 --> 00:53:05.370
to charity and things like that is just amazing.
And I have to say that -- from watching the

00:53:05.370 --> 00:53:08.460
PBS program -- my wife loves your backyard.

00:53:08.460 --> 00:53:10.790
Rick Bayless: [laughing] I love it too.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.300
Q Every time she sees it, she just, "Okay,
we have to have that backyard." [laughter]

00:53:14.300 --> 00:53:17.920
Rick Bayless: You could do it a lot easier
here than I can do it in Chicago. [laughing]

00:53:17.920 --> 00:53:21.539
Q We see all the stuff you're growing, and
I'm thinking -- because I grew up in Michigan

00:53:21.539 --> 00:53:23.359
 -- "How does he grow all that in Chicago?"

00:53:23.359 --> 00:53:27.740
Rick Bayless: I have a small greenhouse, okay?
So that's my concession, because I can't -- a

00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.599
lot of the tropicals and stuff like that,
we have to cut them way back and put them

00:53:31.599 --> 00:53:34.630
in the greenhouse for the winter.
But then oh that glorious day when we get

00:53:34.630 --> 00:53:39.570
to empty the greenhouse and let things start
growing again. And aw, I love it.

00:53:39.570 --> 00:53:43.911
Q My question's completely silly.
It's related to the Top Chef Masters.

00:53:43.911 --> 00:53:49.550
Do you know how to use a microwave?
When Hubert did not know how to use a microwave,

00:53:49.550 --> 00:53:54.700
we were just -- that's just -- it was -- the
reason I mention this is because, again, my

00:53:54.700 --> 00:54:00.490
wife who doesn't cook at all couldn't even
conceive of someone who was so trained and

00:54:00.490 --> 00:54:04.211
just -- it wasn't part of their lexicon to
use a microwave in their everyday life.

00:54:04.211 --> 00:54:09.770
Rick Bayless: Right. The answer to the question
is -- will become obvious when you think about

00:54:09.770 --> 00:54:14.880
a restaurant kitchen.
If you put a microwave in a restaurant kitchen,

00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:20.220
it gets abused all the time.
Because a customer sends something back and

00:54:20.220 --> 00:54:23.170
it's not hot enough.
Where does it go? Into the microwave.

00:54:23.170 --> 00:54:27.460
Well, as you all know, most food doesn't really
like the microwave very much.

00:54:27.460 --> 00:54:31.410
And so, you just wreck food by throwing it
in a microwave.

00:54:31.410 --> 00:54:38.210
So any very self-respecting restaurant will
not have a microwave in the kitchen because

00:54:38.210 --> 00:54:41.870
of the potential abuse.
If they have one, they will have one only

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:47.920
in the pastry station and they use it there
for melting butter or melting chocolate, because

00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.150
it's a good device for doing that.
So that's the only place that you will see

00:54:51.150 --> 00:54:55.130
it.
We have no microwaves anywhere near our restaurant

00:54:55.130 --> 00:54:58.490
kitchen.
But we have a test kitchen above where we

00:54:58.490 --> 00:55:02.420
have a microwave because, occasionally, we'll
test things for books and stuff like that

00:55:02.420 --> 00:55:05.510
in a microwave.
And so, we need to have one for that.

00:55:05.510 --> 00:55:09.549
But I think, if it weren't for that -- if
it weren't for the test kitchen microwave

00:55:09.549 --> 00:55:16.560
 -- I would probably have been in Hubert's
 -- Hubert is not a techno geek at all.

00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:20.910
It's really hilarious, because I had to show
him how to use a pressure cooker on one of

00:55:20.910 --> 00:55:23.420
the things.
But remember, this is the guy that got into

00:55:23.420 --> 00:55:26.859
the shower in the dorm room and rinsed his
pasta off, okay?

00:55:26.859 --> 00:55:31.420
Now, that does not -- [laughter] -- that is
one of those moments that you kind of -- you

00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:36.400
go, "Really? You're going to..." I don't know.
There's nothing wrong with it.

00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:41.500
It's just the whole idea does not make me
want to eat that pasta, okay?

00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:44.732
Olivia Wu: So we're at zero. Thank you so
much.

00:55:44.732 --> 00:55:45.732
Rick Bayless: Thank you all. Thank you very
much.

00:55:45.732 --> 00:55:46.020
&gt;&gt; [Applause]
