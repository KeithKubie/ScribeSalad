[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.290
- Hello, good afternoon.

00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:12.460
So welcome to this event, to a
poetry reading and discussion

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.540
with Major Jackson under
the title of Urban Renewal.

00:00:17.540 --> 00:00:21.260
So apart from its own
worth as a wonderful event,

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:24.910
it's also related to
Radcliffe's urbanism theme

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:27.670
for this entire academic year.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.700
Which we've explored
in all kinds of ways--

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.040
one was a big public lecture
by Garth Risk Hallberg,

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.560
who wrote City on
Fire, a debut novel

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.140
about New York in the 1970s.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.800
And we have a very
large public conference

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.150
that's been a long
time in the planning,

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:47.120
coming up on April 28th.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:50.030
It's called Intersections--
Understanding Urbanism

00:00:50.030 --> 00:00:52.070
in the Global Age.

00:00:52.070 --> 00:00:55.410
And it's three panels
and a keynote speaker,

00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.850
and it should be very
lively and interesting.

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.750
But on to the matter at hand.

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.480
I am especially
pleased to welcome

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.160
Major Jackson, because we were
Radcliffe Fellows together

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:09.210
almost 10 years ago.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.090
So it's nice to meet
again at Radcliffe.

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:16.940
Major Jackson is the author
of four collections of poetry.

00:01:16.940 --> 00:01:20.880
The most recent one is
Roll Deep from 2015.

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:24.280
He's the winner of the
Cave Canem Poetry Prize

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:26.800
and a finalist for the
National Book Critics Circle

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:28.660
Award in Poetry.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:30.810
He's published his
poems and essays

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:34.210
in many different venues,
including The American Poetry

00:01:34.210 --> 00:01:38.330
Review, The Boston Review,
The New Yorker, Poetry,

00:01:38.330 --> 00:01:41.940
Tin House, and other
literary publications.

00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:44.200
He's also won a
very large number

00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:45.890
of important fellowships--

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:50.060
a Guggenheim Fellowship, a
Pushcart Prize, a Whiting

00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:52.690
Writer's Award,
and also he's been

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.090
honored by a Pew
Fellowship in the Arts,

00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.907
and the Witter Bynner
Foundation in conjunction

00:01:57.907 --> 00:01:59.115
with the Library of Congress.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:05.040
He lives in Vermont in
South Burlington, where

00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.759
he is the Richard A. Dennis
University Distinguished

00:02:08.759 --> 00:02:11.680
Professor at the
University of Vermont.

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.090
He serves as the Poetry
Editor at the Harvard Review.

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:17.960
And he has also done
writer-in-residence stints

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:20.310
at University of
Massachusetts in Lowell

00:02:20.310 --> 00:02:21.870
and at Baruch College.

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.160
So I'm really delighted
to welcome Major Jackson.

00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.334
And I hope you'll join me
right now in welcoming him.

00:02:29.334 --> 00:02:29.834
[INAUDIBLE]

00:02:29.834 --> 00:02:38.260
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:38.260 --> 00:02:41.400
- Good afternoon,
late afternoon.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:44.780
This is somewhat of a
homecoming of sorts.

00:02:44.780 --> 00:02:47.740
It's such a pleasure
to be back on the yard,

00:02:47.740 --> 00:02:49.710
the Radcliffe yard.

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:54.540
And it's also daunting,
because I'm reading poems.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:57.560
And I know some of you
have heard these before.

00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:00.800
So I'm going to read
some new poems as well.

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.010
And I want to thank Julie and
Radcliffe and Sean and Becky

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.510
for getting me here.

00:03:08.510 --> 00:03:13.900
As you can hear, I'm also
lacking some vocal cords

00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:16.020
from late night coughing.

00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:21.980
But I'll speak up
loud and hopefully

00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:26.810
gravitate towards this
theme of urban renewal.

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:29.100
When Sean asked for
a title, I should

00:03:29.100 --> 00:03:32.880
have just said poetry reading.

00:03:32.880 --> 00:03:35.810
Now I have to frame my
reading around this theme.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:37.455
And I'm not sure--

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:43.370
I'm not sure how close
I'll get to that.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:48.020
Well, I'm going to start
off with a new poem that's

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:49.160
not in any collection.

00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:55.020
It appeared in The
Virginia Quarterly Review.

00:03:55.020 --> 00:04:00.460
It's called "The Flaneur Tends
a Well-Liked Summer Cocktail."

00:04:00.460 --> 00:04:04.060
"curbside on an Arp-like table.

00:04:04.060 --> 00:04:08.530
He's alone of course, in the
arts district as it were,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:12.410
legs folded, swaying a
foot so that his body seems

00:04:12.410 --> 00:04:17.370
to summon some deep immensity
from all that surrounds--

00:04:17.370 --> 00:04:23.100
dusk shadows inching near a
late-thirtyish couple debating

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:27.640
the post-galactic abyss
of sex with strangers,

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.700
tourists ambling by
only to disappear

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:33.770
into the street's gloomy mouth,

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:37.300
a young Italian woman
bending to retrieve a

00:04:37.300 --> 00:04:42.660
dropped MetroCard, its black
magnetic strip facing up,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:46.000
a lone speckled
brown pigeon breaking

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.250
from a flock of rock
doves, then landing

00:04:49.250 --> 00:04:52.420
near a crushed
fast-food wrapper newly

00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:57.140
tossed by a bike messenger,
the man chortling

00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:00.590
after a sip of
flaxen-colored beer,

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:03.620
remembering that, in
the Gospel of John

00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:07.460
the body and glory converge
linked to incarnation

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:13.590
and so, perhaps, we manifest
each other, a tiny shower

00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.130
of sparks erupting from
the knife sharpener's truck

00:05:17.130 --> 00:05:22.080
who daily leans a
blade into stone,

00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:25.950
a cloudscape reflected in the
rear windshield of a halted

00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:31.480
taxi where inside a trans
woman applies auburn lipstick,

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:34.350
the warlike insignia
on the lapel jacket

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:38.710
of a white-gloved doorman
who opening a glass door

00:05:38.710 --> 00:05:42.020
gets a whiff of a
dowager's thick perfume

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:47.750
and recalls baling timothy
hay as a boy in Albania,

00:05:47.750 --> 00:05:51.240
the woman distractedly
watching a mother debate

00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:54.130
Robert Colescott's
lurid appropriations

00:05:54.130 --> 00:05:57.430
of modernist art
over nicoise salad,

00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:00.330
suddenly frees her left
breast from its cup

00:06:00.330 --> 00:06:03.820
where awaits the blossoming
mouth of an infant wildly

00:06:03.820 --> 00:06:09.420
reaching for a galaxy of
milk behind her dark areola,

00:06:09.420 --> 00:06:15.020
the sharp coughs of a student
carrying a yoga mat, the day's

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.720
last light edging
high-rises on the west side

00:06:18.720 --> 00:06:22.830
so that they seem rimmed by
fire just when the man says,

00:06:22.830 --> 00:06:23.530
And yet,

00:06:23.530 --> 00:06:26.040
immense the wages
we pay boarding

00:06:26.040 --> 00:06:27.640
the great carousel of flesh."

00:06:30.355 --> 00:06:31.325
[APPLAUSE]

00:06:31.325 --> 00:06:35.690
- [INAUDIBLE]

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:36.950
- It happens.

00:06:41.750 --> 00:06:45.250
Thank you.

00:06:45.250 --> 00:06:49.700
So what I was saying
was, to some extent,

00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:55.200
I think the work of the poet
has been to kind of tease

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.230
out among the great morass
of details of our lives,

00:06:59.230 --> 00:07:01.890
very simply to
notice and observe.

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:07.570
And I think that when I
first started writing poetry,

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:13.130
it was very much centered
around my experiences

00:07:13.130 --> 00:07:14.510
growing up in Philadelphia.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:19.060
And so on maybe
much to my chagrin,

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.000
but it definitely
set up this challenge

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:23.660
of me writing about the city.

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:28.770
And I instantly was
tagged this urban poet,

00:07:28.770 --> 00:07:30.880
which felt confining
in a lot of ways.

00:07:30.880 --> 00:07:35.290
And maybe even more confining
when one critic compared me

00:07:35.290 --> 00:07:36.460
to Langston Hughes.

00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.680
He died 40 years ago, like--

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:43.180
anyway.

00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:43.679
Right

00:07:43.679 --> 00:07:46.220
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:46.220 --> 00:07:48.680
Here is the very
first "Urban Renewal."

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.020
I guess I gave Sean that title.

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:56.440
Because "Urban Renewal"
is a series of poems

00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:01.530
that appeared in my first
book and second book,

00:08:01.530 --> 00:08:04.770
not in my third, but
in my fourth book.

00:08:04.770 --> 00:08:11.290
And I very much
have been somewhat--

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:14.240
I find myself growing
inside this poem that

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.210
is actually growing.

00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.760
My concerns are not the
concerns of when I first

00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:26.220
started in graduate
school 20 years ago.

00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:31.140
But there seems to be
the consistency of form

00:08:31.140 --> 00:08:37.289
that allows this to be a kind
of stone that I chip away at.

00:08:37.289 --> 00:08:41.700
In my first book there
are 12 "Urban Renewals,"

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:48.590
and over the past 20
years, I'm up to almost 50.

00:08:48.590 --> 00:08:51.700
My aim when I first
started writing it

00:08:51.700 --> 00:08:53.290
was to write a whole book.

00:08:53.290 --> 00:08:59.630
This was going to be my first
book, the ambitions of youth.

00:08:59.630 --> 00:09:04.627
It was going to be 120
"Urban Renewals," 200,

00:09:04.627 --> 00:09:05.710
it was going to be a tome.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:09.590
It was going to this kind of
bildungsroman coming of age

00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:12.210
about my life.

00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:13.046
Yeah.

00:09:13.046 --> 00:09:14.790
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:14.790 --> 00:09:16.880
It requires great discipline.

00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.760
Here's the very first one.

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.000
"Night museum."

00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.290
"By lamplight my steady
hand brushes a canvas--

00:09:26.290 --> 00:09:29.730
faint arcs of swallows
flapping over rooftops

00:09:29.730 --> 00:09:34.240
swiftly fly into view,
and a radiant backdrop

00:09:34.240 --> 00:09:38.210
of veined lilac dwindling
to a dazzling cerise

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.060
evokes that lost
summer dusk I watched

00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:44.380
a mother straddle
a stoop of brushes,

00:09:44.380 --> 00:09:47.820
combs, a jar of ROYAL CROWN.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:52.270
She was fingering rows dark as
alleys on a young girl's head

00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.450
cocked to one side
like a Modigliani

00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.390
I pledged my life right then
to braiding her lines to mine,

00:10:01.390 --> 00:10:05.710
to anointing streets I love
with all my mind's wit.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:10.450
The boy in me perched on the
curb of this page calls back

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:15.730
between blue-sky Popsicle licks
that festive night the whole

00:10:15.730 --> 00:10:18.900
block set out on
rooftops, in doorways,

00:10:18.900 --> 00:10:21.270
on the hoods of cars--

00:10:21.270 --> 00:10:25.960
a speaker blared Stevie above
Bullock's CORNER STORE awash

00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.360
in fluorescence as the
buoyant shouts of children

00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:32.910
sugared a wall of hide-and-seek.

00:10:32.910 --> 00:10:35.400
Because some patron,
fearing she's

00:10:35.400 --> 00:10:38.450
stumbled into the
wrong part of town,

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:42.450
will likely clutch her
purse and quicken pace,

00:10:42.450 --> 00:10:45.800
I funnel all the
light spreading across

00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:50.110
that young girl's lustrous
head with hopes we lift out

00:10:50.110 --> 00:10:54.040
downturned eyes,
stroll more leisurely,

00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.310
pour over these sights.

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:04.320
You are almost invisible
in all this plain decay.

00:11:04.320 --> 00:11:08.800
Children's laughter echoing
an arcs of hydrant water-spray

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.480
knots the heart--

00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:13.550
those black bathers
like Cezannes

00:11:13.550 --> 00:11:16.530
could soon petrify to silence.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:21.050
A chorus of power lines
hums a melancholic hymn,

00:11:21.050 --> 00:11:25.330
tenements' aching pyrrhics,
doorways and row-homes

00:11:25.330 --> 00:11:28.340
crumbling to gutted relics--

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.330
this one exposing
a nude staircase,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:34.810
that one a second-floor
ceiling where

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:37.820
swings a lightbulb
like your chipped soul

00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.230
suspended from a
thread of nerves.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.210
You have never
imagined a paradise,

00:11:44.210 --> 00:11:46.960
nor made a country
of your ghetto,

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:51.470
only suffered the casket a
vessel for the human shadow,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:55.460
feared, longing for
other stones to worship.

00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:00.070
The sun dreams the crowns
of trees behind skyscrapers.

00:12:00.070 --> 00:12:03.600
Here the heart is its own
light; a pigeon's gurgle

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:04.910
sings the earth.

00:12:04.910 --> 00:12:09.430
The eyes of the dead
to float around us--

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:14.720
muraled Polaroids, street-corner
billboards whose slogans

00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:16.810
read, 'Aching humans.

00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:27.360
Prosperous gardens.'"

00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:34.100
With both Hoops and
Roll Deep, I open up

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:38.570
with a long, somewhat long
poem, not really long poem,

00:12:38.570 --> 00:12:45.940
but a medium-sized poem
that has a narrative.

00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:48.140
In this particular
narrative, and I

00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:50.870
should say that a
lot of the poems that

00:12:50.870 --> 00:12:55.550
are kind of story-based poems,
there's a lot of embellishment

00:12:55.550 --> 00:12:58.710
and then there's
always something in it

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:00.590
that's at the core
of the experience

00:13:00.590 --> 00:13:02.840
that I'm trying to get at.

00:13:02.840 --> 00:13:08.040
But this is definitely
based on true story.

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.660
Not all of it is true, though.

00:13:10.660 --> 00:13:14.870
It's about that two weeks
I worked at McDonald's.

00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:16.850
"Selling Out."

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:21.430
"Off from a double at
McDonald's, no autumnal pinata,

00:13:21.430 --> 00:13:23.610
no dying leaves
crumbling to bits

00:13:23.610 --> 00:13:27.520
of colored paper on the
sidewalks only yesterday,

00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:31.190
just each breath
bursting to explosive fog

00:13:31.190 --> 00:13:35.360
in a dead-end alley near
Fifth, where on my knees

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:39.540
my fingers laced on my head
and the square barrel prodding

00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:43.920
a temple, I thought of
me in the afterlife.

00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:47.180
Moments ago, Chris
Wilder and I jogged down

00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.580
Girard lost in the
promise of two girls who

00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.530
winked past pitch
lanes of burgers

00:13:53.530 --> 00:13:58.750
and squared chips of fish, at us
reigning over grills and vats.

00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:02.010
Moments ago, a barrage
of beepers and timers

00:14:02.010 --> 00:14:04.730
smeared the lengths
of our chests,

00:14:04.730 --> 00:14:09.190
a swarm of hard-hatted day
workers coded in white dust,

00:14:09.190 --> 00:14:13.500
mothers on relief, the minimum
wage poor from the fast-food

00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:17.400
joints lining Broad
Street inched us closer

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:20.150
in the check cashing
line towards the window

00:14:20.150 --> 00:14:25.650
of our dreams, all of anxious to
enact the power of our riches.

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.810
Me in the afterlife,
what did it matter?

00:14:28.810 --> 00:14:32.330
Chris and I still in
our polyester uniforms

00:14:32.330 --> 00:14:35.230
caked with day-old
batter, setting out

00:14:35.230 --> 00:14:37.670
for evening of passion marks?

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:42.320
We wore Gazelles, matching
sheepskins, the ushanka miles

00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:43.680
from Leningrad.

00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:46.230
Chris said, let's cop some blow.

00:14:46.230 --> 00:14:50.710
Despite my schoolboy jitters,
a loose spread of dealers

00:14:50.710 --> 00:14:52.300
preserved corners.

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.650
Then a kid large
for the chrome Huffy

00:14:54.650 --> 00:14:58.190
he pedaled, said he
had the white stuff,

00:14:58.190 --> 00:15:01.760
and led us to an alley
fronted by an iron gate

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:06.000
on a gentrified street
edging Northern Liberties.

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.490
I turned to tell Chris how the
night air dissolved like soil,

00:15:10.490 --> 00:15:15.550
how jangling keys made my neck
itch, how maybe this wasn't so

00:15:15.550 --> 00:15:20.290
good an idea, when the
cold opening of gun barrel

00:15:20.290 --> 00:15:23.280
still poked my head
and Chris's eyes

00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:27.240
widened like two water
spills before he bound away

00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:31.340
to a future of headphones
and release parties.

00:15:31.340 --> 00:15:32.270
Me?

00:15:32.270 --> 00:15:34.000
The afterlife?

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.680
Had I ever welcomed back
the old neighborhood?

00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:41.390
Might a longing, persistent
as the seedcorn maggot,

00:15:41.390 --> 00:15:43.050
tunnel through me?

00:15:43.050 --> 00:15:46.930
All I know, a single dog
barked his own vapor,

00:15:46.930 --> 00:15:50.770
and emptiness echoed through
blasted shells of row homes

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.040
rising above.

00:15:52.040 --> 00:15:55.580
And I heard deliverance in
the bare branches fingering

00:15:55.580 --> 00:15:59.690
a series of power lines and
silhouette to the moon's

00:15:59.690 --> 00:16:03.740
hushed excursion across the
batter fields of our lives

00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:08.420
that endless night of
ricocheting fear and shame.

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:12.720
No one survives, no one
unclasps his few strands

00:16:12.720 --> 00:16:15.590
of gold chains or
hums Amazing Grace

00:16:15.590 --> 00:16:18.870
or pours all his
measly bills and coins

00:16:18.870 --> 00:16:23.040
into the trembling free hand
of his brother and survives.

00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:27.690
No one is forced face down
and weights 40 minutes to rise

00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:31.980
and begin again his march
pass the ice-crusted dirt,

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:35.770
without friendship, who barely
knew why the cry of the earth

00:16:35.770 --> 00:16:40.120
set him running even from
the season's string of lights

00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:43.260
flashing its pathetic
shot at cheer--

00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.440
to arrive here where the
page is blank, an afterlife."

00:16:52.550 --> 00:16:58.390
So many of those poems in
the first book really do--

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.650
I really can't see you, so--

00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:08.990
there you are-- they very much
had to do with what I felt

00:17:08.990 --> 00:17:13.470
as though was a kind of--

00:17:13.470 --> 00:17:14.579
I say billboard.

00:17:14.579 --> 00:17:17.910
But I guess what
I want to say is

00:17:17.910 --> 00:17:21.980
that, I felt like my poems
which dealt with my youth,

00:17:21.980 --> 00:17:25.160
was writing against
some of what I felt

00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:29.060
was some of the kind
of cliched narratives

00:17:29.060 --> 00:17:31.730
around black men
and black bodies.

00:17:31.730 --> 00:17:35.750
And what I wanted my poems to
do is give texture to that,

00:17:35.750 --> 00:17:39.070
to create some sort,
at least in my poems,

00:17:39.070 --> 00:17:42.960
a kind of an
interiority that we can

00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.530
think about when we
come across nightly news

00:17:45.530 --> 00:17:51.250
or when we come across
movies that tout and glorify

00:17:51.250 --> 00:17:54.980
a certain image and
a certain lifestyle.

00:17:54.980 --> 00:17:57.110
So that's what occupied me.

00:17:57.110 --> 00:17:59.470
And then, of course, you
grow up, you read books.

00:17:59.470 --> 00:18:02.960
You get all literary,
and then that passion

00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:07.830
starts to kind of turn
in other directions.

00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:10.620
But what I will say
is that I'm still

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:14.460
haunted by some of the
real life stories of people

00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:18.210
that I grew up
with, and inspired.

00:18:18.210 --> 00:18:21.300
So Roll Deep was
kind of a way for me

00:18:21.300 --> 00:18:25.160
to return to some of the poems
that I had written and put

00:18:25.160 --> 00:18:29.940
aside, or to write new poems.

00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.070
And there was also
part of the reason

00:18:32.070 --> 00:18:39.330
why I also put those poems aside
is because many of my friends

00:18:39.330 --> 00:18:45.590
who write and are very
conscious about race work

00:18:45.590 --> 00:18:48.790
as it relates to
art work, often will

00:18:48.790 --> 00:18:55.350
get into conversations
around representing,

00:18:55.350 --> 00:18:56.640
how poems represented.

00:18:56.640 --> 00:19:00.940
Which felt at that time,
now that I think about it,

00:19:00.940 --> 00:19:04.870
felt like the pressure that
the early poets of the Harlem

00:19:04.870 --> 00:19:08.440
Renaissance had
to face when they

00:19:08.440 --> 00:19:10.310
went to write
about folk culture,

00:19:10.310 --> 00:19:14.450
or write, as Langston
Hughes did, write poems

00:19:14.450 --> 00:19:17.660
based on a blues aesthetic.

00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:21.000
And a lot of what we're
talking about, to some extent,

00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:31.250
is the politics of
both art and race,

00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:36.380
but also thinking
about not wanting

00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:42.480
to focus too much for
fear that people turn some

00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:45.520
of the narratives into
emblematic narratives

00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:48.780
of all black people.

00:19:48.780 --> 00:19:52.440
So there's a certain
kind of politics

00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:55.870
that I did want to engage
in by writing these.

00:19:55.870 --> 00:20:01.930
So that was one of the
challenges I want to say,

00:20:01.930 --> 00:20:05.410
what we call
respectability politics.

00:20:05.410 --> 00:20:06.570
I'll use that phrase.

00:20:06.570 --> 00:20:09.680
That was popular
there for a minute.

00:20:09.680 --> 00:20:12.340
Yeah, so my friends would
talk about other poets

00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:16.950
performing Blackness or how
the dominant culture sees

00:20:16.950 --> 00:20:18.660
Blackness.

00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:20.614
And so I put those poems aside.

00:20:20.614 --> 00:20:22.530
Even though they're
there, even though they're

00:20:22.530 --> 00:20:24.250
based on real people.

00:20:24.250 --> 00:20:27.000
I decided I did not
want to engage in that.

00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.890
But here is a poem.

00:20:28.890 --> 00:20:33.630
I'm happy I've pushed that,
leapt over that hurdle.

00:20:33.630 --> 00:20:35.850
Here is a poem called
"Mighty Pawns," which

00:20:35.850 --> 00:20:39.480
is based on a group of,
at least the portrait,

00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:44.040
is based on some young men that
I grew up with in Philadelphia

00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.830
who played chess.

00:20:45.830 --> 00:20:49.070
But to encounter them on the
street, you wouldn't think--

00:20:49.070 --> 00:20:53.040
most of you would not
think they had the capacity

00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.950
to engage in such
a difficult art.

00:20:54.950 --> 00:20:59.000
And yet they were
grandmaster chess players who

00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:01.215
lived in this very poor
neighborhood in Philadelphia

00:21:01.215 --> 00:21:04.790
and they traveled, they
traveled the world.

00:21:04.790 --> 00:21:08.010
And I don't know where
any of them are today.

00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:11.600
But they had a great math
teacher who taught them.

00:21:11.600 --> 00:21:14.850
He's named in here.

00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:17.410
And Hollywood made
a movie about them,

00:21:17.410 --> 00:21:20.020
if you're interested
in looking it up.

00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:24.230
They were called
The Bad Bishops,

00:21:24.230 --> 00:21:26.480
that was the name of the team.

00:21:26.480 --> 00:21:29.880
But the movie is
called "Mighty Pawns"

00:21:29.880 --> 00:21:31.250
if you want to look at it.

00:21:31.250 --> 00:21:34.170
It's a bad '80s film, B rated.

00:21:34.170 --> 00:21:37.710
But has some historical valence.

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:39.460
"Mighty Pawns."

00:21:39.460 --> 00:21:41.630
"If I told you
Earl, the toughest

00:21:41.630 --> 00:21:44.600
kid on my block in
North Philadelphia,

00:21:44.600 --> 00:21:49.620
could beat any man or woman
in ten moves playing white,

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:53.040
or that he traveled to
Yugoslavia to frustrate

00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.100
the bearded masters at the
Belgrade Chess Association,

00:21:57.100 --> 00:22:00.270
you'd think I was
given to hyperbole,

00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:02.500
and if, at
dinnertime, I took you

00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:05.640
into the faint light
of his Section 8 home,

00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:12.030
wreaking of onions, liver, and
gravy, his six little brothers

00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:14.690
fighting on a broken
love-seat for room

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:18.870
in front of a cracked flat
screen, one whose diaper sags,

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:23.070
it's a wonder it hasn't fallen
to his ankles, the walls

00:22:23.070 --> 00:22:27.880
behind doors exposing sheet
rock the perfect O of a handle,

00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:30.950
and the slats of stairs
missing where Baby-boy

00:22:30.950 --> 00:22:35.210
gets stuck trying to ascend
to a dominion foreign to you

00:22:35.210 --> 00:22:38.870
and me with its loud
timbales and drums blasting

00:22:38.870 --> 00:22:43.870
down, blasting down from the
closed room of his cousin

00:22:43.870 --> 00:22:47.790
whose mother stands on a corner
on the other side of town

00:22:47.790 --> 00:22:51.690
all times of day and night,
except when her relief

00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:54.800
check arrives at the
beginning of the month,

00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:58.310
you'd get a better
picture of Earl's ferocity

00:22:58.310 --> 00:23:02.440
after class on the board
in Mr. Sherman's class,

00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.780
but not necessarily
when he stands

00:23:04.780 --> 00:23:10.330
near you at a downtown bus-stop
in a jacket a size too small,

00:23:10.330 --> 00:23:12.580
hunching his shoulders
around his ears,

00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:16.160
as you imagine the checkered
squares of his poverty

00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:21.240
and anger, and pray he does
not return his precise gaze too

00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:23.800
long in your
direction for fear he

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.850
blames you and proceeds
to take your Queen."

00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:37.320
So that poem is
what I realized when

00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:41.270
I wrote it was in the
process of attempting

00:23:41.270 --> 00:23:45.930
to dignified lives that
in the public imagination

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:48.840
did not have a certain
kind of richness,

00:23:48.840 --> 00:23:52.480
I felt like I realized
some of what I was doing

00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:58.860
was creating portraits of
people that I grew up with.

00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:06.390
And all the attendant
kind of challenges

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:09.270
that arise from that.

00:24:09.270 --> 00:24:14.950
Some of the-- remember I said
not everything that I write

00:24:14.950 --> 00:24:16.400
is true?

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.520
Just remember that.

00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:21.520
"Blunts."

00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:23.790
"The first time I
got high, I stood

00:24:23.790 --> 00:24:26.750
in a circle of boys
at 23rd and Ridge

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:30.140
tucked inside a doorway
that smelled of urine.

00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:31.300
It was March.

00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.210
The cold rains all
but blurred our sight

00:24:34.210 --> 00:24:36.950
as we feigned
sophistication, passing

00:24:36.950 --> 00:24:40.350
a bullet-shaped bottle
of malt. Johnny Cash

00:24:40.350 --> 00:24:42.880
had a love for
transcendental numbers

00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:47.190
and explained between puffs
resembling little gasps of air,

00:24:47.190 --> 00:24:51.210
the link to all creation
was the mathematician.

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:55.370
Malik, the smartest of the
crew, counterargued and cited

00:24:55.370 --> 00:24:59.780
the holy life or prayer as a
gateway to the Islamic faith

00:24:59.780 --> 00:25:02.410
that was, for all
intents, the true path

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.700
for the righteous black man.

00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.790
No one disputed.

00:25:05.790 --> 00:25:10.210
Malik cocked his head, pinched
the joint and pulled so hard,

00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:15.010
we imagined his lips crazy
glued into stiff O's.

00:25:15.010 --> 00:25:17.700
It was long agreed that
Lefty would inherit

00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:21.430
his father's used car
business, thus destined

00:25:21.430 --> 00:25:23.470
for a life of wrecks.

00:25:23.470 --> 00:25:27.880
Then, amid a fit of coughing,
I broke the silence.

00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.030
I want to be a poet.

00:25:30.030 --> 00:25:31.890
It was nearing dinnertime.

00:25:31.890 --> 00:25:33.470
Jesus lived here.

00:25:33.470 --> 00:25:35.930
His sister was yelling
at their siblings

00:25:35.930 --> 00:25:38.790
over the evening
news and game shows.

00:25:38.790 --> 00:25:41.670
The stench of hot
dogs and sauerkraut

00:25:41.670 --> 00:25:43.670
drifted down the dank hallway.

00:25:43.670 --> 00:25:47.090
A pre-spring wind flapped
the plastic covering

00:25:47.090 --> 00:25:51.040
of a junkman's shopping cart,
as Eddie Hardwick licked left

00:25:51.040 --> 00:25:55.360
to right the thin strip of glue
at the edge of a rolling paper,

00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:59.450
then uttered, 'so, you
want the tongue of God?'

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:03.290
I bent double in the blade of
smoke and looked up for help.

00:26:03.290 --> 00:26:04.650
It was too late.

00:26:04.650 --> 00:26:05.650
We were tragically hip."

00:26:11.390 --> 00:26:21.380
So you grow up, you
have adult experiences.

00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:24.480
And you write about
that hopefully.

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:32.880
Or you move to Vermont,
and you go, oh, I didn't

00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:36.130
think I was a nature poet.

00:26:36.130 --> 00:26:38.660
But this landscape is
doing something to me.

00:26:41.530 --> 00:26:49.020
This is a poem that--

00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:50.470
it's more associative.

00:26:50.470 --> 00:26:55.000
I realize so much of my style
was changing over the years

00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:01.020
when I unburdened myself trying
to write a certain kind of way

00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:02.800
and experiment.

00:27:02.800 --> 00:27:10.930
And I guess for me, there's
so much of writing poetry

00:27:10.930 --> 00:27:12.520
that I enjoy.

00:27:12.520 --> 00:27:16.780
I enjoy collaging images.

00:27:16.780 --> 00:27:19.500
I enjoy making sounds.

00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:22.370
I enjoy attempting,
at least, to create

00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:27.600
some sort of authentic utterance
that strikes your ear, even

00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:33.190
though it may not on
the surface offer up

00:27:33.190 --> 00:27:37.400
in the way of literal
cognitive meaning,

00:27:37.400 --> 00:27:41.590
my hope is that the words
are felt in the body.

00:27:41.590 --> 00:27:46.540
So that was a kind of very
deliberate choice of mine.

00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:49.880
Some of my friends thought I
was going for the anarchist's

00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:53.650
effect, the toss meaning
out the window altogether,

00:27:53.650 --> 00:27:55.940
but that's not true.

00:27:55.940 --> 00:27:57.700
"Enchanters of
Addison County," which

00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:03.280
is just South of where I live
in Burlington in Chittenden

00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:03.950
County.

00:28:03.950 --> 00:28:07.460
They say all of Vermont,
there's more cows than people,

00:28:07.460 --> 00:28:11.890
but definitely in Addison
County, that is true.

00:28:11.890 --> 00:28:14.220
"Enchanters of Addison County."

00:28:14.220 --> 00:28:17.770
"We were more than
gestural, close-listening,

00:28:17.770 --> 00:28:21.250
the scent of manure writing
its waft on the leaves

00:28:21.250 --> 00:28:23.820
off Route 22A.

00:28:23.820 --> 00:28:27.350
By nightfall, our
gaze flecked like loon

00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:31.890
cries, but no one was up
for turnips nor other roots,

00:28:31.890 --> 00:28:34.900
not least of which the clergy.

00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:38.280
Romanticism has its
detractors, which

00:28:38.280 --> 00:28:42.110
is why we lined the road
with tea-lit luminaries

00:28:42.110 --> 00:28:43.430
and fresh-cut lemons.

00:28:43.430 --> 00:28:48.860
We called it making magic, then
stormed the corners and porches

00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:51.710
of General Stores,
kissing whenever

00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.370
cars idled at four
way stop signs

00:28:55.370 --> 00:28:59.570
or sought Grade A maple
syrup in tin containers

00:28:59.570 --> 00:29:03.690
with painted scenes of
horse-drawn farmers plowing

00:29:03.690 --> 00:29:05.900
through snow.

00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:09.790
The silhouetted, rusted farm
equipment gave us the laidback

00:29:09.790 --> 00:29:14.320
heaven we so often wished,
and fireflies bequeathed earth

00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:20.130
stars, such blink and
blank and bunk-a-bunk-bunk.

00:29:20.130 --> 00:29:22.560
And of course we
wondered if we existed,

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.560
and also too, the
cows in the ancient

00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.080
pastures, and the white milk
inside our heads like church

00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:34.410
spires and ice cream cones,
even after all that cha-cha-cha,

00:29:34.410 --> 00:29:38.080
we still came out of swimming
holes shivering our hearts out.

00:29:43.980 --> 00:29:44.980
Here's an "Ode to Mt.

00:29:44.980 --> 00:29:46.243
Philo."

00:29:46.243 --> 00:29:49.550
I won't read that.

00:29:49.550 --> 00:29:54.980
These two graduate students
today talked to me about a poem

00:29:54.980 --> 00:29:58.490
that I'd written that's
published online as part

00:29:58.490 --> 00:29:59.870
of the "Urban Renewal" series.

00:29:59.870 --> 00:30:03.560
It's called "Urban
Renewal Number

00:30:03.560 --> 00:30:06.310
28," subtitled "Vermont."

00:30:06.310 --> 00:30:10.610
I want to read this and
dedicate it to them.

00:30:10.610 --> 00:30:12.790
Because I often
don't read this poem,

00:30:12.790 --> 00:30:17.110
but they had some great insight.

00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:21.130
I have a rhododendron bush
just outside my office window

00:30:21.130 --> 00:30:22.080
where I write.

00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:27.200
And a very heavy
winter just turned.

00:30:27.200 --> 00:30:30.380
I'm not sure if you've
seen it, but the leaves

00:30:30.380 --> 00:30:34.180
will wilt into these
tight brown curls.

00:30:34.180 --> 00:30:41.440
And for many years that
bush was doing fine.

00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:45.290
And then I kept waiting for
either those leaves to drop

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:52.110
and new blooms come up,
and nothing happened.

00:30:52.110 --> 00:30:57.160
So I'm sitting
there, and I think

00:30:57.160 --> 00:31:05.940
I start associating very quickly
that image of those wilted

00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:07.330
leaves.

00:31:07.330 --> 00:31:10.130
And as we talked
about in class, I

00:31:10.130 --> 00:31:14.670
think so much of the
artist's imagination

00:31:14.670 --> 00:31:20.700
is about almost
doing a very swift,

00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.700
some would say time
travel, but really

00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:26.420
is what Bly calls leaps,
these leaps of images

00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:32.650
came to me in this poem, was an
attempt to capture that moment.

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:35.550
"Number 28, Vermont."

00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:38.600
"Outside my window,
a brutal winter

00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.830
burn has curled rhododendron
leaves to clusters

00:31:41.830 --> 00:31:44.710
of tight brown wilts.

00:31:44.710 --> 00:31:49.160
Tobacco-colored, they hang
where white lilacs and pink

00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:54.180
azaleas blush to spring's
myth of resurrection.

00:31:54.180 --> 00:31:58.840
A maple sapling sprouts erect
amidst a snarling tangle

00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:02.960
of bare branches as I wait
for the droops to uncoil.

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:05.450
Why this hopefulness?

00:32:05.450 --> 00:32:09.280
Soft tinted postcards
of sagging corpses

00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:13.630
lynched by mobs in Elk's Arch,
Pritchard, Springfield, Waco,

00:32:13.630 --> 00:32:18.310
Texas, mix and crossfade
my sight in broad daylight

00:32:18.310 --> 00:32:23.570
like scenes from America's
PowerPoint show of perversity.

00:32:23.570 --> 00:32:28.900
At Duke, an undergrad tweets
an obscene noose to friends,

00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:34.860
seen by millions to 'come
and hang out with us.'

00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:38.600
Spooked while driving
in Virginia, a friend

00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:42.330
once swore the roadside
litter in oaks and pines

00:32:42.330 --> 00:32:46.310
flapping white plastic
bags were coded messages

00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:50.060
marking a new race war.

00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:55.850
Whiteness is never having to
question the history of trees.

00:32:55.850 --> 00:32:59.040
When I search this morning
"How to Revive a Dying

00:32:59.040 --> 00:33:02.810
Rhododendron," YouTube
recommends the speeches

00:33:02.810 --> 00:33:07.140
of Reverend Louis Farrakhan,
Holiday's "Black Bodies

00:33:07.140 --> 00:33:08.090
Swinging."

00:33:12.440 --> 00:33:19.600
So more of a Vermont poem.

00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:29.071
My son plays soccer and
lacrosse, and he's OK.

00:33:29.071 --> 00:33:31.010
He's pretty good.

00:33:31.010 --> 00:33:34.490
But it means you
got to go to games.

00:33:34.490 --> 00:33:38.510
[LAUGHTER]

00:33:38.510 --> 00:33:40.910
And on this one
particular autumn

00:33:40.910 --> 00:33:47.695
day, I was really enjoying
the change of seasons.

00:33:50.650 --> 00:33:53.060
I thought by-- and this is
also from the "Urban Renewal"

00:33:53.060 --> 00:33:55.260
series, but it's not
in any of the books.

00:33:55.260 --> 00:33:59.260
"I thought by now my
reverence would have waned.

00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.980
Matured to the temperate
silence of the bookish

00:34:02.980 --> 00:34:06.420
or revealed how blase
I've grown with age.

00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.330
But the unrestrained joy I fill
when the black skein of geese

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.219
voyage like a
dropstring from God,

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.630
slowly shifting and soaring.

00:34:16.630 --> 00:34:19.139
When the decayed
apples of an orchard

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:23.850
amass beneath its trees,
like Eve's first party.

00:34:23.850 --> 00:34:28.100
When driving in the road,
Vanna Whites its crops of corn

00:34:28.100 --> 00:34:32.210
whose stalks will soon give
way to a harvester's blade

00:34:32.210 --> 00:34:35.750
and turn the land to
a man's unruly face.

00:34:35.750 --> 00:34:39.929
Makes me believe I'll never
sooth the pagan in me,

00:34:39.929 --> 00:34:43.389
nor exhibit the
propriety of the polite.

00:34:43.389 --> 00:34:45.850
After a few whiskeys,
I'm loud this time

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:49.889
of year, unseemly as
a Chevron of hulking.

00:34:49.889 --> 00:34:53.540
I'm fire in the leaves,
obstreporous as a drunk New

00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:55.190
England farmer.

00:34:55.190 --> 00:34:58.380
I see fear in the
eyes of his children.

00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:00.970
They walk home from
school and evening

00:35:00.970 --> 00:35:04.260
falls like an advancing
trickle of bats,

00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:08.140
the sky pungent as
bounty and chimney smoke.

00:35:08.140 --> 00:35:11.710
I read the scowl beneath
the smiles of parents

00:35:11.710 --> 00:35:13.960
at my son's soccer game.

00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:17.970
Their agitation, which is
the figure the yellow leaves

00:35:17.970 --> 00:35:21.668
make of a quaking Aspen."

00:35:21.668 --> 00:35:26.476
[PAPERS RUSTLING]

00:35:26.476 --> 00:35:26.975
OK.

00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:37.680
Just a few more, and
thank you for being here.

00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:38.960
Did I do that already?

00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:39.920
Every poet does that.

00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.910
Thank you for coming.

00:35:40.910 --> 00:35:45.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:48.790
This is "My Children's
Inheritance."

"A fancy for high
green hills by a sea.

00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.000
Baggy spaces in the day.

00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.890
A knack for gunpowder
thinking, a library humming

00:36:01.890 --> 00:36:05.640
like a swarm of
gnats, the intrigue

00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:09.300
of a woman with a
pitch perfect mind,

00:36:09.300 --> 00:36:13.910
blinking eyes whose silence
is ancient and naked,

00:36:13.910 --> 00:36:18.570
a grave that is not a grave but
a ruin to visit in middle age."

00:36:21.121 --> 00:36:22.620
I laughed at that
when I wrote that.

00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.078
I was like my
children, they're not

00:36:24.078 --> 00:36:27.030
going to visit my
grave like when I die.

00:36:27.030 --> 00:36:31.680
It's like later when they're
going through their own crises.

00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:33.770
They're going to come
through the grave,

00:36:33.770 --> 00:36:35.290
but it will be ruined.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:40.780
"A grave that is not a grave but
a ruin to visit in middle age.

00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:43.720
A chifforobe of half
empty cologne bottles

00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:46.450
in various colors
and dried flowers

00:36:46.450 --> 00:36:49.720
more dignified in
death, both evidence

00:36:49.720 --> 00:36:53.140
that I once cherished
bouquets and timelessness.

00:36:56.150 --> 00:37:02.250
Bullet casings, a bowl
of sea shells, fine pens.

00:37:02.250 --> 00:37:06.970
One, the Aurora Diamante with
its two-toned rhodium plating

00:37:06.970 --> 00:37:11.980
that glitters when my right
hand rages towards heaven.

00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:17.920
A love of big plates of
pasta, Argentinian folk music,

00:37:17.920 --> 00:37:21.410
African rainforest and the
speeches of Lincoln that

00:37:21.410 --> 00:37:26.510
missed the pages of my
books more than my doorways,

00:37:26.510 --> 00:37:28.970
a habit for dancing
when beats drop

00:37:28.970 --> 00:37:32.740
like existential stones, a
disregard for the enemies

00:37:32.740 --> 00:37:37.540
of linnets and macaws, fears
that match the hawk haunted

00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:41.030
buttes out west, a hard
desire for justice,

00:37:41.030 --> 00:37:43.580
the habit of lip-biting
when trouble nears,

00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:47.870
the way my mouth opens like
a flower, my quiver of arrows

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:52.170
that outweighs the world,
leaving the animals to bear

00:37:52.170 --> 00:37:53.660
witness.

00:37:53.660 --> 00:37:59.080
Memories of laughter that was
bread and water, stylus hats,

00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:02.930
wasted time travel, the
consequences of mistakes

00:38:02.930 --> 00:38:08.610
and second thoughts gone to the
future, collection of radios,

00:38:08.610 --> 00:38:12.410
stacks of vinyl, the
limitations of secrets,

00:38:12.410 --> 00:38:16.070
long nights that
cascaded like waterfalls,

00:38:16.070 --> 00:38:19.370
my madness, granular
and complex,

00:38:19.370 --> 00:38:21.120
sealed like a foot fall.

00:38:23.960 --> 00:38:29.890
My son and me at the bar in
Otto's near Fifth Avenue,

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:32.550
both off from work,
the heavy foot

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:37.100
traffic of silhouetted
commuters hastening home outside

00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:41.070
and us here, two drinks in.

00:38:41.070 --> 00:38:45.270
The conversation has just
ramped up, and he wants to know

00:38:45.270 --> 00:38:49.880
why I did it, how could I
have betrayed our family?

00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:54.620
The bartender is in night
school, we learn for law,

00:38:54.620 --> 00:38:59.840
but meanwhile, he can name all
the great vineyards in Sonoma

00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:02.720
and how many laborers
work the field

00:39:02.720 --> 00:39:06.610
and how many at the crush pad
last planting season, which

00:39:06.610 --> 00:39:10.530
incidentally he said, gave us
some of the best varietals,

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:13.260
he's told, in years.

00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:16.030
But it's all really
just a racket

00:39:16.030 --> 00:39:20.760
though, like anything
else in life, he says.

00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:27.560
I want to tell my son about the
great poems I've taught today.

00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:31.650
Yet careful to avoid the
sad lives of the poets.

00:39:31.650 --> 00:39:34.230
But he has long been
exhausted of lines

00:39:34.230 --> 00:39:38.760
I recited to him since a
child, my eyes carrying

00:39:38.760 --> 00:39:41.550
the exuberance of art.

00:39:41.550 --> 00:39:44.260
And so would only
agitate and call up

00:39:44.260 --> 00:39:47.960
his condemnation of my
friends as phonies parading

00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:50.500
their pseudointelligence.

00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:55.690
Instead, I reach for is hand
across the varnished oak top.

00:39:55.690 --> 00:40:00.500
I was dying I say, living
a country of lives.

00:40:00.500 --> 00:40:02.940
To which he shakes his head.

00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:08.330
I swirl my glass, looking down
avidly, churning the air so as

00:40:08.330 --> 00:40:13.200
to deliver oxygen and open up
the wine, wishing to release

00:40:13.200 --> 00:40:16.670
its veiled bouquet."

00:40:16.670 --> 00:40:19.650
I'm going to end with two poems.

00:40:19.650 --> 00:40:22.580
This is called "You Reader."

00:40:22.580 --> 00:40:34.540
And it was fun writing this
poem because, again, I often go

00:40:34.540 --> 00:40:38.790
for a particular sound.

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:41.030
"You Reader."

00:40:41.030 --> 00:40:44.760
"So often I dream of the
secrets of satellites

00:40:44.760 --> 00:40:48.900
and so often I want the moose
to step from the shadows

00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:53.940
and reveal his transgressions,
and so often I come to her body

00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:56.210
as though she were
Lookout Mountain.

00:40:56.210 --> 00:41:00.030
But give me a farmer's market
to park my [? martyred ?] mass

00:41:00.030 --> 00:41:02.340
and I will name
all the dirt roads

00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:07.730
that dead end at the cubist
sculpture called my infinity.

00:41:07.730 --> 00:41:12.180
For I no longer light bonfires
in the city of adulterers

00:41:12.180 --> 00:41:15.360
and no longer smudge
the cheeks of debutantes

00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.460
currently floating across
the high fruit of night.

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.640
And yes, I know
there is only one

00:41:22.640 --> 00:41:27.260
notable death in any small town,
and that is the pig farmer.

00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:31.080
But listen, at all times
the proud rivers mourn

00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.140
my absence, especially when
like a full moon, you reader,

00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:40.330
hidden behind a spray of
night blooming serious, drift

00:41:40.330 --> 00:41:45.030
in and out of scattered clouds,
above lighthouses producing

00:41:45.030 --> 00:41:49.290
there artificial calm just
to sweep a chalk of light

00:41:49.290 --> 00:41:50.460
over distant waters."

00:41:53.730 --> 00:41:57.350
And my last poem is
called "On Disappearing."

00:42:03.670 --> 00:42:06.610
"On Disappearing."

00:42:06.610 --> 00:42:09.560
"I have not disappeared.

00:42:09.560 --> 00:42:12.470
The boulevard is
full of my steps.

00:42:12.470 --> 00:42:15.180
The sky is full of my thinking.

00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:18.690
And archbishop
prays for my soul,

00:42:18.690 --> 00:42:24.400
even then he was busy
waving at a congregation.

00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:28.160
The ticking clocks in
Vermont sway back and forth,

00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:32.800
as those sweeping up my eyes
and my tattoos and my metaphors

00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:37.790
and what comes up are the great
paragraphs of dust, which also

00:42:37.790 --> 00:42:41.680
carry motes of my existence.

00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:43.810
I have not disappeared.

00:42:43.810 --> 00:42:46.470
My wife quivers inside a kiss.

00:42:46.470 --> 00:42:51.100
My pulse was given to her
many times in many countries.

00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:54.230
The chunks of bread
we dip in olive oil

00:42:54.230 --> 00:42:59.820
is communion with our ancestors,
who also have not disappeared.

00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:04.140
Their delicate songs
I wear on my eyelids.

00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:06.920
Their smiles have
given me freedom, which

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:11.120
is a crater I keep falling in.

00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:13.940
When I bite into the two
halves of an orange, whose

00:43:13.940 --> 00:43:17.780
cross section resembles my
lungs, a delta of juices

00:43:17.780 --> 00:43:21.050
burst down my chin and
like magic, makes me

00:43:21.050 --> 00:43:24.460
appear to those who
think I've disappeared.

00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:26.990
It's too bad war
makes people disappear

00:43:26.990 --> 00:43:31.570
like chess pieces, that prisons
term prisoners into movie

00:43:31.570 --> 00:43:34.360
endings.

00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.370
When I fade into the
mountains on a forest trail,

00:43:38.370 --> 00:43:40.810
I still have not disappeared.

00:43:40.810 --> 00:43:44.440
Even though it's green
facade turns my arms and legs

00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:46.520
into branches of oak.

00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:50.100
It is then I belong to
a southerly wind, which

00:43:50.100 --> 00:43:53.860
by now you have mistaken
as me nodding back

00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:58.460
and forth like a Hasid in prayer
or a mother who's just lost

00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.320
her son to gunfire in Detroit.

00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.560
I have not disappeared.

00:44:03.560 --> 00:44:07.970
In my children, I see my
bulging face pressing further

00:44:07.970 --> 00:44:10.240
into the mysteries.

00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:15.850
In a library in Tucson, on
the plane above Buenos Aires,

00:44:15.850 --> 00:44:19.660
on a field where nearby
burns a controlled fire,

00:44:19.660 --> 00:44:24.150
I'm held by a professor, a
General, and a photographer.

00:44:24.150 --> 00:44:26.460
One burns a finely
wrapped cigar,

00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:29.570
then sniffs the scented
pages of my books,

00:44:29.570 --> 00:44:32.960
scouring for the bitter
smell of control.

00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:37.240
I hold him in my
mind like a chalice.

00:44:37.240 --> 00:44:39.300
I have not disappeared.

00:44:39.300 --> 00:44:42.440
I swish the amber hue
of lager on my tongue

00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.690
and ponder the drilling rigs
in the Gulf of Alaska and all

00:44:46.690 --> 00:44:50.240
the oil-painted plovers.

00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.780
When we talk about
limits, we disappear.

00:44:53.780 --> 00:44:58.510
In Jasper, Texas you can
disappear on a strip of gravel.

00:44:58.510 --> 00:45:00.750
I'm a life in secret language.

00:45:00.750 --> 00:45:03.700
Termites toil over
a grave and my mind

00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:06.470
is a routine of yesterdays.

00:45:06.470 --> 00:45:08.410
At a glance from
across the room,

00:45:08.410 --> 00:45:12.360
I wear September on my
face, which is eternal,

00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:16.220
and does not disappear even
if you close your eyes once

00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:19.685
and for all simultaneously
like two coffins."

00:45:19.685 --> 00:45:23.473
[APPLAUSE]

00:45:35.698 --> 00:45:39.630
You're going to
have to make a tea.

00:45:39.630 --> 00:45:43.870
- OK, so I'll get us started
with a few questions,

00:45:43.870 --> 00:45:46.330
and then we'll let
you ask questions.

00:45:46.330 --> 00:45:49.770
So I won't take
up too much time.

00:45:49.770 --> 00:45:53.200
So thank you very
much for that reading.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:55.270
It was wonderful.

00:45:55.270 --> 00:46:01.590
I wanted to ask, so urban
renewal is a series of poems,

00:46:01.590 --> 00:46:07.300
but it extends across three
of your four books of poetry.

00:46:07.300 --> 00:46:11.810
And then you also referred to
one that was published online,

00:46:11.810 --> 00:46:15.110
and you also read us some
poems that were clearly--

00:46:15.110 --> 00:46:17.570
that were set in
Vermont that were part

00:46:17.570 --> 00:46:19.400
of the "Urban Renewal" series.

00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:22.850
So several questions
come to mind.

00:46:22.850 --> 00:46:27.410
One is, when did you realize
you were writing a series?

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:31.130
And how do you
feel about the fact

00:46:31.130 --> 00:46:35.230
that your series is
dispersed and not kind of

00:46:35.230 --> 00:46:38.820
collected and presented as such?

00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:44.830
- Well, that youthful dream
of that tome of a book

00:46:44.830 --> 00:46:47.470
is still deep inside me.

00:46:47.470 --> 00:46:48.970
I still want them
to come together.

00:46:48.970 --> 00:46:51.980
And my hope is that I'll
write enough of them

00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:55.060
that even the ones
that are dispersed

00:46:55.060 --> 00:46:58.960
will find a home all together.

00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:01.850
What I wanted to read
were the poems of travel

00:47:01.850 --> 00:47:08.220
that also are written in
this particular form, poems

00:47:08.220 --> 00:47:17.550
that take place in Italy, in
Kenya, Greece, Spain, Jamaica.

00:47:17.550 --> 00:47:22.030
And what I'm realizing
is that it's not so much

00:47:22.030 --> 00:47:25.600
a poem of place
as it is me trying

00:47:25.600 --> 00:47:29.770
to inhabit different
landscapes and grow

00:47:29.770 --> 00:47:32.660
inside this particular form.

00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:34.550
If you look at them
on the page, they're

00:47:34.550 --> 00:47:36.685
all kinds of single
blocks of text.

00:47:39.210 --> 00:47:42.350
And there's a formalism
that either you hear

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.260
or you don't hear.

00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:48.330
And there's alternating
rhymes and internal rhyme

00:47:48.330 --> 00:47:51.030
and these kind of
long, lush sentences

00:47:51.030 --> 00:47:57.410
that accrete, hopefully
empowerment through images.

00:47:57.410 --> 00:48:02.410
So I have been consistent
in that regard.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:07.130
It's just that the lens has
widened to include my life not

00:48:07.130 --> 00:48:08.180
just in Philadelphia.

00:48:08.180 --> 00:48:12.350
So this poem is
growing along with me.

00:48:12.350 --> 00:48:16.210
- And the term renewal,
"Urban Renewal."

00:48:16.210 --> 00:48:23.270
- Even back then I read just
a little bit about Richard

00:48:23.270 --> 00:48:31.000
Nixon's Urban Policy to
rebuild cities post the riots,

00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.470
post-1960s, 1970s.

00:48:34.470 --> 00:48:39.150
And knew even then when I
first started that I wanted

00:48:39.150 --> 00:48:40.650
to appropriate that term.

00:48:40.650 --> 00:48:44.090
Because so much of
what I wanted to get at

00:48:44.090 --> 00:48:49.840
is that my young life was
enriched by the presence of art

00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:51.830
in my life and people.

00:48:51.830 --> 00:48:54.900
And so the renewal--

00:48:54.900 --> 00:48:58.140
it's supposed to signify
on that social policy,

00:48:58.140 --> 00:49:00.740
but it's more if you like
look at the poems and some

00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.290
of the themes that come
through, many of them

00:49:03.290 --> 00:49:08.670
kind of narrate my encounters
with people in my neighborhood

00:49:08.670 --> 00:49:12.530
or works of art, music.

00:49:12.530 --> 00:49:18.665
The musician Sun Ra lived two
or three blocks away from me

00:49:18.665 --> 00:49:21.040
in Germantown.

00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:24.260
I visited-- I've said
this in other views,

00:49:24.260 --> 00:49:28.390
but I grew up in the
Philadelphia Museum of Art.

00:49:28.390 --> 00:49:32.490
So "Urban Renewal" was, again,
to get at certain narratives

00:49:32.490 --> 00:49:35.200
that you wouldn't
know if you relied

00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.952
on popular culture
or the evening news.

00:49:39.952 --> 00:49:42.110
- Yeah, that makes sense.

00:49:42.110 --> 00:49:46.960
I also wanted to ask
you about the flaneur.

00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:47.760
- Ah, yes.

00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:49.150
- Because you mentioned it.

00:49:49.150 --> 00:49:52.190
This famous concept
introduced in the 19th century

00:49:52.190 --> 00:49:54.970
by Charles Baudelaire, the poet.

00:49:54.970 --> 00:49:58.900
And the flaneur is a
stroller, an urban stroller,

00:49:58.900 --> 00:50:01.460
probably a bourgeois
subject with a lot

00:50:01.460 --> 00:50:05.860
of time on his hands,
and probably a he.

00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:10.910
And it's kind of a way
of taking in the scene,

00:50:10.910 --> 00:50:15.020
but also kind of being a
master of it, I suppose.

00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:19.590
So yours was alone
in an Arts District,

00:50:19.590 --> 00:50:22.470
sitting at a table
and drinking beer.

00:50:22.470 --> 00:50:24.990
And so I just, I
mean I just would

00:50:24.990 --> 00:50:28.320
like to ask how you think
the persona of the flaneur,

00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:31.400
that's so kind of
charged for us.

00:50:31.400 --> 00:50:33.500
- Yes, it is.

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.500
- How it works in your poetry.

00:50:35.500 --> 00:50:39.240
- Well, you're absolutely
right to talk about or allude

00:50:39.240 --> 00:50:41.930
to class and
privilege, but again, I

00:50:41.930 --> 00:50:50.227
think what I take away from
that figure is the imperative

00:50:50.227 --> 00:50:55.150
to enter into what
is being seen.

00:50:55.150 --> 00:51:00.940
And what I was trying to say
earlier, I think writers,

00:51:00.940 --> 00:51:04.050
I won't say poets, although
we're the superior [? form-- ?]

00:51:04.050 --> 00:51:08.970
everyone knows we're superior
at this than anyone else.

00:51:08.970 --> 00:51:13.980
But poets, particularly
I think the best of us,

00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:18.890
going back to Russian
formalism, they

00:51:18.890 --> 00:51:21.870
defamiliarize what
is seen around us.

00:51:21.870 --> 00:51:27.860
And I think part of what
I've long been trying to do

00:51:27.860 --> 00:51:32.170
is kind of tease
out what strikes me

00:51:32.170 --> 00:51:38.210
as not terribly
remarkable on the surface,

00:51:38.210 --> 00:51:40.660
but to kind of delve
a little bit further.

00:51:40.660 --> 00:51:44.840
And I really do think
it's what we often

00:51:44.840 --> 00:51:47.170
say is contextualization.

00:51:47.170 --> 00:51:53.390
And so the guy who's delivering
a package in New York

00:51:53.390 --> 00:51:58.180
City, where that poem
took place actually,

00:51:58.180 --> 00:52:02.000
who's eating at the same
time he's navigating traffic,

00:52:02.000 --> 00:52:05.090
and tosses his wrapper.

00:52:05.090 --> 00:52:07.430
You know, that's a
detail that could quickly

00:52:07.430 --> 00:52:16.490
go by, but if you think about
that bird, the series of images

00:52:16.490 --> 00:52:17.580
that came to me.

00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:19.280
Sometimes, and I
wonder if there's

00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:21.290
writers in the room
that feel this way,

00:52:21.290 --> 00:52:24.050
it can be overwhelming,
the kind of flood.

00:52:24.050 --> 00:52:28.990
And so there's some
part of the flaneur that

00:52:28.990 --> 00:52:33.100
is almost compulsory, I think.

00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:37.282
The strolling part, however, I
wish I could do more of that.

00:52:37.282 --> 00:52:39.240
- You can sit and have
a beer, right, and still

00:52:39.240 --> 00:52:42.492
consider yourself a flaneur.

00:52:42.492 --> 00:52:43.950
- It's more of an
emblematic figure

00:52:43.950 --> 00:52:48.820
than an actual
theoretical figure for me.

00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:50.780
- Yeah, that makes sense.

00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:53.120
So I'll ask one more
question, and then we'll

00:52:53.120 --> 00:52:56.400
open it up to the floor.

00:52:56.400 --> 00:53:03.380
The question I wanted
to ask was what

00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:07.260
for you personally is the
connection between the urban

00:53:07.260 --> 00:53:11.790
and poetry, specifically?

00:53:11.790 --> 00:53:14.470
- I knew you were
going to ask that.

00:53:14.470 --> 00:53:17.774
I almost wrote an
answer down because--

00:53:17.774 --> 00:53:20.130
- How could I not?

00:53:20.130 --> 00:53:26.380
- I recently have been
acquainting my youngest son

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:28.710
with the Harlem Renaissance.

00:53:28.710 --> 00:53:34.880
And I was thinking about the
migration of African Americans

00:53:34.880 --> 00:53:39.420
who brought with
them to the North

00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:44.200
a whole set of values,
but also a culture.

00:53:44.200 --> 00:53:52.210
And how wonderful that
particular moment was captured

00:53:52.210 --> 00:53:55.510
in the literature specifically.

00:53:58.840 --> 00:54:03.670
I think during that
particular period,

00:54:03.670 --> 00:54:06.550
I'm thinking about
how a life gets

00:54:06.550 --> 00:54:09.540
recorded and almost archived.

00:54:09.540 --> 00:54:14.380
And so I see the poet as kind
of archiving rich experiences

00:54:14.380 --> 00:54:18.540
in our lives, just to kind of
go back to that a little bit.

00:54:18.540 --> 00:54:24.340
Also, if I think about
poetry, I was saying this

00:54:24.340 --> 00:54:28.530
to some students
today, I can hear--

00:54:28.530 --> 00:54:36.470
believe it or not, I can hear
1920s in the poetry of Elliott.

00:54:36.470 --> 00:54:42.310
I can hear the rhythm
of that particular age.

00:54:42.310 --> 00:54:48.780
And I think finding the rhythmic
equivalents and language

00:54:48.780 --> 00:54:54.910
to a particular age, such
that it enters our body,

00:54:54.910 --> 00:54:59.930
particularly in urban spaces
when so much of it is--

00:54:59.930 --> 00:55:04.400
my house in Vermont
is totally very chill.

00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:09.160
And I get here, and
it's like hop in a taxi.

00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:10.660
Go get to where you're going.

00:55:10.660 --> 00:55:11.430
Jump out.

00:55:11.430 --> 00:55:12.740
Someone's rushing in.

00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:13.540
Get your coffee.

00:55:13.540 --> 00:55:15.170
Someone's in line behind you.

00:55:15.170 --> 00:55:17.490
Someone's in front of you.

00:55:17.490 --> 00:55:23.290
So I think that art helps
to slow us down in a way,

00:55:23.290 --> 00:55:27.590
while it's recording, I think
while the poet is recording.

00:55:27.590 --> 00:55:29.600
There's something
about the pacing

00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.480
of a poem that forces you
to acclimate to its rhythms.

00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:43.510
And that holds true, too,
for rural areas as well.

00:55:43.510 --> 00:55:47.170
I think part of, if you listen
to country music and blues,

00:55:47.170 --> 00:55:50.890
bluegrass, you can hear the
kind of languidness of time

00:55:50.890 --> 00:55:53.210
that exists in rural spaces.

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:58.560
So I think poems record
on many different levels.

00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:00.710
- Thank you.

00:56:00.710 --> 00:56:04.830
All right, so I'm sure that
some of you have questions

00:56:04.830 --> 00:56:06.660
that you'd like to
ask Major Jackson.

00:56:06.660 --> 00:56:10.180
And maybe I'll just
let you recognize

00:56:10.180 --> 00:56:12.650
people who have their hands up.

00:56:12.650 --> 00:56:15.810
Be sure to maybe stand
up and ask your question

00:56:15.810 --> 00:56:18.790
with some volume.

00:56:18.790 --> 00:56:20.468
Yeah.

00:56:20.468 --> 00:56:26.069
- [INAUDIBLE] And I am
fascinated by two things that

00:56:26.069 --> 00:56:26.777
happened tonight.

00:56:26.777 --> 00:56:29.840
I had a conversation
with someone from India,

00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:32.430
and my thing is,
I have the sense

00:56:32.430 --> 00:56:34.930
that my spiritual
home is in India,

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:36.360
even though I'm not from there.

00:56:36.360 --> 00:56:38.520
I've never been to India
or anything like that.

00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:42.300
But you have mentioned
twice Argentina.

00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:44.646
Flying over Buenos Aires,
my friend is from Argentina,

00:56:44.646 --> 00:56:46.270
and we were thinking
about [INAUDIBLE].

00:56:46.270 --> 00:56:49.700
And flying over Buenos
Aires and [INAUDIBLE] of

00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:53.790
recorded music from Argentina
as part of [INAUDIBLE] legacy.

00:56:53.790 --> 00:56:55.966
What's up with that?

00:56:55.966 --> 00:56:57.780
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:00.770
- What's up with
me and Argentina?

00:57:00.770 --> 00:57:04.260
I have this belief that if
you put the energy in poems,

00:57:04.260 --> 00:57:05.400
it will happen.

00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.970
So I'm trying to get there.

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:12.220
Let's talk.

00:57:15.470 --> 00:57:20.530
Well, South American
culture, I mean,

00:57:20.530 --> 00:57:22.140
where there's
Peruvian culture, I'm

00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:27.170
really fascinated, interested
in the presence of,

00:57:27.170 --> 00:57:30.840
and the lasting cultural
legacy of Africa there.

00:57:30.840 --> 00:57:34.190
And so if I do go
there, it would probably

00:57:34.190 --> 00:57:35.970
be more research.

00:57:35.970 --> 00:57:37.450
But I love the culture.

00:57:37.450 --> 00:57:38.950
And I love the food.

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:43.880
And a friend of mine, I was
very jealous of a friend of mine

00:57:43.880 --> 00:57:48.330
who got to spend three
or four years there.

00:57:48.330 --> 00:57:52.230
And there's a very
vibrant art scene as well.

00:57:52.230 --> 00:57:57.700
So I think-- and the music,
I mentioned the folk music,

00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:00.750
particularly, has been
really important to me.

00:58:00.750 --> 00:58:04.600
I don't listen to too much music
when I write, but when I do,

00:58:04.600 --> 00:58:08.186
that's among the music
that's in rotation.

00:58:08.186 --> 00:58:08.686
Yeah.

00:58:13.606 --> 00:58:14.590
Hello, sir.

00:58:14.590 --> 00:58:17.560
Yes?

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:21.380
- I'm interested in your
relationship to the political.

00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:27.310
Specifically, how do political
pressures from your communities

00:58:27.310 --> 00:58:34.740
and also internal pressures
that you place upon yourself

00:58:34.740 --> 00:58:38.260
affect your relationship
with a blank page?

00:58:38.260 --> 00:58:40.650
Meaning how-- it
seems like you have

00:58:40.650 --> 00:58:47.060
this very distilled, defined
relationship with your lens.

00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.540
Could you expound on that?

00:58:53.320 --> 00:58:56.480
- What I was speaking earlier
about respectability politics.

00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:04.960
I think that at some point
became a kind of a lock

00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.810
on my imagination.

00:59:06.810 --> 00:59:08.630
And it became very important.

00:59:08.630 --> 00:59:11.750
That was the only pressure,
let me just say, that I felt.

00:59:11.750 --> 00:59:21.820
Because my mentors were very
literally both black and white

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:26.070
people who came from
progressive communities.

00:59:26.070 --> 00:59:31.005
In my life there
was a Jesuit priest

00:59:31.005 --> 00:59:37.110
who worked with Dan
Berrigan and his brother.

00:59:37.110 --> 00:59:44.060
There were activists from
the '60s and '70s, teachers,

00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:47.550
writers, who were mentors.

00:59:47.550 --> 00:59:51.730
And so I inherited this
continuum I would say,

00:59:51.730 --> 00:59:57.020
of consciousness around
art that was functional,

00:59:57.020 --> 01:00:00.870
art that made a difference,
art that protested.

01:00:00.870 --> 01:00:02.670
And then at some point,
and I don't know,

01:00:02.670 --> 01:00:07.330
I can't figure out when
necessarily, there's

01:00:07.330 --> 01:00:12.230
a certain demand that
you have for you art

01:00:12.230 --> 01:00:17.860
to be art, to elevate to the
realm of art and not sloganary.

01:00:17.860 --> 01:00:21.530
However, that's not
me at all announcing

01:00:21.530 --> 01:00:24.950
myself as apolitical.

01:00:24.950 --> 01:00:27.870
And in fact, I
firmly believe it's

01:00:27.870 --> 01:00:33.760
the mark of an artist's or
writer's maturation when they

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:37.530
realize that their
writing should

01:00:37.530 --> 01:00:42.460
be beholden and responsible
to us as a larger

01:00:42.460 --> 01:00:47.980
community of human beings who
are trying to navigate shifts

01:00:47.980 --> 01:00:53.030
in regimes, political
regimes, and decency.

01:00:53.030 --> 01:00:56.570
And I want to add to
that particular decency.

01:00:56.570 --> 01:00:59.710
The thing is I want it
to be on my own terms.

01:00:59.710 --> 01:01:02.110
I don't want it to
be programmatic.

01:01:02.110 --> 01:01:04.660
And I want it to be artful.

01:01:04.660 --> 01:01:09.720
So I think there's been some
tremendous, wonderful poems

01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:14.920
that have been written that
protest conditions here

01:01:14.920 --> 01:01:18.750
in America and my
great regret is

01:01:18.750 --> 01:01:21.150
that we do not
celebrate and teach

01:01:21.150 --> 01:01:26.240
that tradition in this country.

01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:30.700
And it's not just protest
poems or Vietnam War poems.

01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:33.270
There are forms that are
far more quiet than that

01:01:33.270 --> 01:01:38.540
but have great political
valence and resonance.

01:01:38.540 --> 01:01:40.240
That should be an
award that we give,

01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:44.090
much like the Poetry
Foundation gives an award to,

01:01:44.090 --> 01:01:49.460
I think it's the Mark Twain
Award for humorous poetry.

01:01:49.460 --> 01:01:52.130
I think we need to come
up with an award that

01:01:52.130 --> 01:01:57.280
announces the political
dimensions of our work.

01:01:57.280 --> 01:02:01.810
Anyway, how does it
impact my relationship

01:02:01.810 --> 01:02:03.580
to the page and my art?

01:02:03.580 --> 01:02:05.290
I think it's a
wonderful challenge.

01:02:05.290 --> 01:02:09.260
I think it forces me to--

01:02:09.260 --> 01:02:12.460
I said it was a chain or
a lock on my imagination.

01:02:12.460 --> 01:02:15.810
But I'd like the challenge
of writing something

01:02:15.810 --> 01:02:22.300
that will hopefully
have an impact

01:02:22.300 --> 01:02:29.020
and that furthers the cause
of social, political justice.

01:02:29.020 --> 01:02:32.030
Sometimes there's been
several poems of mine

01:02:32.030 --> 01:02:34.880
that someone has
brought up to me

01:02:34.880 --> 01:02:37.510
and said, hey, this one guy
was like, oh, your poem,

01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:40.770
"How to Listen."

01:02:40.770 --> 01:02:41.610
I go, you're a poet?

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.250
He goes, no, no, but
I really like it.

01:02:43.250 --> 01:02:46.220
I open this group
meeting that I have

01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:52.070
for men that batter their wives
with your poem "How to Listen."

01:02:52.070 --> 01:02:56.470
And I'm like, if you
told me to write a poem

01:02:56.470 --> 01:02:58.490
about a group of guys who--

01:02:58.490 --> 01:03:00.020
I probably would have frozen up.

01:03:00.020 --> 01:03:05.670
But who knows how poems
exist and find their readers

01:03:05.670 --> 01:03:08.830
in the world, and
how people are going

01:03:08.830 --> 01:03:14.340
to take it in and hold it close
and use it and pass it on?

01:03:14.340 --> 01:03:16.380
That's a mystery to me.

01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:20.640
But I think it's just enough
to pay close attention

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:23.640
to language, the
demands of form,

01:03:23.640 --> 01:03:26.440
the desire to make a new sound.

01:03:26.440 --> 01:03:27.435
Those are all noble.

01:03:31.275 --> 01:03:31.775
Hello.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:35.390
- Thank you.

01:03:35.390 --> 01:03:36.850
How long had you
lived in Vermont

01:03:36.850 --> 01:03:40.350
before you found
Vermont-based imagery creeping

01:03:40.350 --> 01:03:41.240
into your poetry?

01:03:41.240 --> 01:03:43.250
And maybe you could talk
a little bit about--

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:45.720
- Yeah, I resisted
it for awhile.

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:48.010
I resisted writing
about ice fishing.

01:03:51.370 --> 01:03:54.260
There's moose signs everywhere.

01:03:54.260 --> 01:03:55.520
I haven't seen one yet.

01:03:55.520 --> 01:03:56.520
I've read about them.

01:04:00.220 --> 01:04:07.370
It took me about
close to 12 years

01:04:07.370 --> 01:04:10.680
to finally decide
that OK, I'm going

01:04:10.680 --> 01:04:13.790
to write about this place.

01:04:13.790 --> 01:04:15.690
It's startling, beautiful.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:19.670
I drove cross country to Oregon
to go to graduate school.

01:04:19.670 --> 01:04:22.800
And I camped along the
way with a girlfriend

01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.220
who wasn't so keen on camping.

01:04:25.220 --> 01:04:29.220
So we had to go into these
motels and hotels occasionally.

01:04:29.220 --> 01:04:35.610
But what happened for me was
this very deep appreciation

01:04:35.610 --> 01:04:39.130
for landscapes and
varieties of landscapes

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:42.760
and really how stunningly
beautiful this country is.

01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.770
But when I got to
the Cascade Mountains

01:04:44.770 --> 01:04:48.900
and northwest and hit the
coast, the Pacific coast,

01:04:48.900 --> 01:04:50.810
something inside me just broke.

01:04:50.810 --> 01:04:56.340
And so I realized that I was
gravitating towards landscapes

01:04:56.340 --> 01:04:57.830
of this particular sort.

01:04:57.830 --> 01:05:02.580
Everyone will tell you,
African-Americans make up

01:05:02.580 --> 01:05:05.830
less than 0.1% of Vermont.

01:05:05.830 --> 01:05:07.790
And we joke that we
all know each other.

01:05:07.790 --> 01:05:10.630
And if someone leaves,
even temporarily,

01:05:10.630 --> 01:05:15.620
half the population decreases.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:18.550
Fortunately for me, though,
I travel quite a bit.

01:05:18.550 --> 01:05:22.700
And I still have family up
and down the east coast.

01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:27.670
So I never really felt
firmly in Vermont,

01:05:27.670 --> 01:05:29.780
because I was traveling so much.

01:05:29.780 --> 01:05:35.140
But a couple years ago
I decided that this

01:05:35.140 --> 01:05:37.980
will be home for awhile, I
might as well contribute.

01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:39.700
There was a great
number of writers

01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:45.325
who have come through there,
Ashberry and Ron Padgett

01:05:45.325 --> 01:05:49.540
is a great poet who
has come through there.

01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:54.480
And Vermont has no shortage
of writers and poets,

01:05:54.480 --> 01:05:55.930
a great tradition of writing.

01:05:55.930 --> 01:05:59.030
So I'm reading a lot
of Grace Paley now,

01:05:59.030 --> 01:06:01.664
who wrote about
Thetford, Vermont.

01:06:01.664 --> 01:06:03.330
Everyone knows she
wrote about New York,

01:06:03.330 --> 01:06:05.570
but she lives in Thetford.

01:06:05.570 --> 01:06:09.727
Galway Kinnell,
wonderful tradition.

01:06:14.697 --> 01:06:15.691
- Microphone?

01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:20.080
- Hi.

01:06:20.080 --> 01:06:20.860
- Hi.

01:06:20.860 --> 01:06:27.550
- I was getting in a dreamy
state listening to your color

01:06:27.550 --> 01:06:33.780
that you're bringing into
your poetry, particularly just

01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:38.020
descriptive aspects
which becomes almost

01:06:38.020 --> 01:06:42.200
painterly in some aspects.

01:06:42.200 --> 01:06:46.880
But I wonder-- maybe in
connection to the Philadelphia

01:06:46.880 --> 01:06:55.360
Museum of Art-- how you escaped
the really decimating aspect

01:06:55.360 --> 01:07:01.110
of urban renewal in Philadelphia
during the '60s and '70s,

01:07:01.110 --> 01:07:07.590
which largely attributed to the
destruction of the inner city.

01:07:07.590 --> 01:07:11.400
Basically, the whites moved
out into suburban areas.

01:07:11.400 --> 01:07:13.670
And that was not uncommon
in American cities.

01:07:13.670 --> 01:07:22.130
And it left a
certain income, which

01:07:22.130 --> 01:07:26.980
was the middle class white
income, which somewhat

01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:30.710
sustained the city from
completely breaking down

01:07:30.710 --> 01:07:35.470
into pockets of really,
really extreme poverty.

01:07:39.360 --> 01:07:43.170
Which didn't have any money,
unless it was supported

01:07:43.170 --> 01:07:49.710
by, say, antipoverty
program, which

01:07:49.710 --> 01:07:54.290
was actually a way of
keeping you in poverty.

01:07:54.290 --> 01:08:00.360
So can you contrast that
to moving to Vermont,

01:08:00.360 --> 01:08:09.120
which is sort of an antithesis
to that kind of environment.

01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:12.860
And maybe draw it
from your poetry

01:08:12.860 --> 01:08:18.740
from the standpoint of your
museum experiences as a kid.

01:08:24.990 --> 01:08:27.025
Well, I would never
use the word escape.

01:08:30.450 --> 01:08:33.200
People have used that
word in the past.

01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:36.870
And I understand, from the
outside, what it looks like.

01:08:39.439 --> 01:08:46.600
I was going to use some visuals
tonight to get at that contrast

01:08:46.600 --> 01:08:49.609
that you're talking about.

01:08:49.609 --> 01:08:53.010
But I'll say this.

01:08:53.010 --> 01:08:59.024
It was such a rich experience
growing up where I grew up.

01:09:05.109 --> 01:09:09.069
The people around me
had great dimensions.

01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:19.460
Evenings were full of
fun and music and play.

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:22.140
And then crack cocaine came.

01:09:22.140 --> 01:09:29.290
And that was the bomb
that had people compromise

01:09:29.290 --> 01:09:34.779
long held values
that sustained them

01:09:34.779 --> 01:09:37.779
for a long time and
their communities.

01:09:40.830 --> 01:09:43.939
I had like a lot of people who--

01:09:43.939 --> 01:09:46.229
if you read Richard
Rodriguez and others,

01:09:46.229 --> 01:09:51.290
there's someone who mentored
you or took a special interest

01:09:51.290 --> 01:09:55.070
in you, someone who
said, apply here.

01:09:55.070 --> 01:10:06.210
I was assistant Nancy pushed
a summer math camp at--

01:10:06.210 --> 01:10:07.956
not Exeter, what's
the other one?

01:10:07.956 --> 01:10:08.455
Andover.

01:10:11.350 --> 01:10:17.780
My mom was like, no, I
don't know no Andover.

01:10:17.780 --> 01:10:18.730
Right?

01:10:18.730 --> 01:10:20.870
It was people like that.

01:10:20.870 --> 01:10:24.900
And I wouldn't say escape
as much as I was fortunate.

01:10:24.900 --> 01:10:27.700
My therapist asked
the same question.

01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.790
How did you escape?

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:31.560
No, I was quite fortunate.

01:10:31.560 --> 01:10:38.300
And I had interests
that kind of made

01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:41.440
me stand out a little bit--

01:10:41.440 --> 01:10:43.305
books.

01:10:43.305 --> 01:10:44.180
I shouldn't say that.

01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:45.861
That's wrong.

01:10:45.861 --> 01:10:47.460
I had friends who read.

01:10:47.460 --> 01:10:50.040
And there was a group
of us, group of kids.

01:10:53.880 --> 01:10:56.030
To some extent, you're
right to ask that question.

01:10:56.030 --> 01:10:58.180
I very much appreciate it.

01:10:58.180 --> 01:11:01.450
One of things that I'm
taking up now as a project

01:11:01.450 --> 01:11:06.320
is the amount of rural
poverty in New England.

01:11:06.320 --> 01:11:10.020
And I want to do a photo
exhibit and write poems.

01:11:10.020 --> 01:11:12.520
I want to take the
photos and write poems.

01:11:12.520 --> 01:11:16.900
I think the label that--

01:11:16.900 --> 01:11:19.480
and this is part of reason
why I started writing--

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.830
I wanted to dignify
the lives of people

01:11:21.830 --> 01:11:25.700
that we kind of write
off in urban areas

01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:27.400
because they're poor.

01:11:27.400 --> 01:11:30.410
And one of the things
that this election showed

01:11:30.410 --> 01:11:37.990
us is that we have to challenge
those particular terms

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:44.750
because the level of poverty
in rural environments

01:11:44.750 --> 01:11:50.600
outstrips some of what we
are accustomed to seeing

01:11:50.600 --> 01:11:53.590
on the screen.

01:11:53.590 --> 01:12:00.990
It's profound to find yourself
in certain places, whoa.

01:12:00.990 --> 01:12:04.500
And then you really realize
that the narrative here isn't

01:12:04.500 --> 01:12:07.960
about race or who's a racist.

01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:11.510
It really boils
down to who has it

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:16.460
and who doesn't have
it, very simply that.

01:12:16.460 --> 01:12:19.260
I've traveled quite
a bit over the years,

01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:23.280
and I've seen that
dynamic in Kenya.

01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:26.100
I've seen it in
parts of Paris, who

01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.582
has it, who doesn't have it.

01:12:28.582 --> 01:12:30.040
There's certain
parts of Paris that

01:12:30.040 --> 01:12:32.290
look like where I grew up
right around the corner.

01:12:32.290 --> 01:12:38.070
The crazy thing is a young
lady that I recently met,

01:12:38.070 --> 01:12:39.990
she teaches art at
Temple University.

01:12:39.990 --> 01:12:42.050
So you go oh, where do you live?

01:12:42.050 --> 01:12:43.185
26 and Thompson.

01:12:43.185 --> 01:12:47.710
I was like, you would
have been robbed,

01:12:47.710 --> 01:12:49.080
like what are you doing?

01:12:49.080 --> 01:12:50.834
The area's so gentrified now.

01:12:50.834 --> 01:12:53.000
I haven't been to my old
neighborhood in many years.

01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:59.430
But what you're talking
about, white flight

01:12:59.430 --> 01:13:05.520
and social policies
definitely had an impact.

01:13:05.520 --> 01:13:10.280
But I think Tally's
Corner or any other study

01:13:10.280 --> 01:13:15.970
you want to point to, they
don't give the rich narrative

01:13:15.970 --> 01:13:20.390
that I feel like poems
and stories can give us.

01:13:26.390 --> 01:13:27.034
Hey, y'all.

01:13:27.034 --> 01:13:27.950
Thank you for coming--

01:13:27.950 --> 01:13:28.550
- Wait, wait, wait,

01:13:28.550 --> 01:13:29.050
- No?

01:13:29.050 --> 01:13:30.687
There's one more?

01:13:30.687 --> 01:13:33.270
- I was just going to ask since
you brought up Tally's Corner.

01:13:33.270 --> 01:13:35.600
There's this like great
Ralph Ellison quote about him

01:13:35.600 --> 01:13:37.910
not seeing Harlem
in the sociology

01:13:37.910 --> 01:13:39.160
that he was reading about it.

01:13:39.160 --> 01:13:41.390
And as a sort of
urban sociologist,

01:13:41.390 --> 01:13:44.890
I'm curious if you can sort
of impart any advice on how

01:13:44.890 --> 01:13:48.600
to sort of describe in ways that
feel authentic, urban places,

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:50.440
beyond the form of poetry.

01:13:50.440 --> 01:13:54.440
- Yeah, so repeat
that last part again.

01:13:54.440 --> 01:13:56.606
So what's the core
of the question?

01:13:56.606 --> 01:14:00.570
- How to describe-- what you
want to call authentic or rich

01:14:00.570 --> 01:14:03.270
urban places beyond
the form of poetry.

01:14:03.270 --> 01:14:08.170
- That's where I feel like I
often push my students away

01:14:08.170 --> 01:14:13.350
from cliched thinking
and to kind of cultivate

01:14:13.350 --> 01:14:16.870
a restlessness with words.

01:14:16.870 --> 01:14:20.160
And that's where I
feel like figuration

01:14:20.160 --> 01:14:23.440
starts to create great
nuance and maybe gets

01:14:23.440 --> 01:14:26.370
to a greater precision.

01:14:26.370 --> 01:14:33.220
I wrote an essay about the fact
that white people don't write

01:14:33.220 --> 01:14:35.050
about race in this country.

01:14:35.050 --> 01:14:38.230
Now we do because some
things have happened.

01:14:38.230 --> 01:14:42.800
But at that time the poems
that I looked at, for example,

01:14:42.800 --> 01:14:46.910
the popular term for white
poets writing about race

01:14:46.910 --> 01:14:50.040
was always big and black.

01:14:50.040 --> 01:14:53.196
It's amazing, I
couldn't believe it.

01:14:53.196 --> 01:14:54.570
Every time I opened
a poem it was

01:14:54.570 --> 01:14:57.576
like why do we have to put
those two words together?

01:14:57.576 --> 01:14:59.340
Are there no black dwarves?

01:14:59.340 --> 01:15:03.850
No one that you're not like
afraid of, that's not scary?

01:15:03.850 --> 01:15:04.400
Right?

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:08.090
But that's the
inherited language.

01:15:08.090 --> 01:15:11.300
Or the young men
who wear clothes

01:15:11.300 --> 01:15:15.360
that's not tight-fitting also.

01:15:15.360 --> 01:15:19.970
How do you describe that in a
way that isn't about your fear?

01:15:19.970 --> 01:15:21.680
You know what I'm saying?

01:15:21.680 --> 01:15:24.560
So I think finding
the language really

01:15:24.560 --> 01:15:31.380
has to come from some genuine
space that is generous

01:15:31.380 --> 01:15:34.530
and that is humane.

01:15:34.530 --> 01:15:37.410
I think I hate to
say it, but I think

01:15:37.410 --> 01:15:39.750
journalists are very lazy.

01:15:39.750 --> 01:15:42.060
And they help to
contribute, unfortunately.

01:15:48.430 --> 01:15:50.490
- Well if I'm not
mistaken, I think

01:15:50.490 --> 01:15:54.350
there's a small reception
just outside the room.

01:15:54.350 --> 01:15:58.520
So if you want to speak
directly with Major Jackson,

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.185
then that's where you can
do it for a little while,

01:16:01.185 --> 01:16:01.810
if he holds up.

01:16:01.810 --> 01:16:03.820
- Yeah, I'm doing good.

01:16:03.820 --> 01:16:05.120
- Thank you very, very much.

01:16:05.120 --> 01:16:05.620
- Thank you.

01:16:05.620 --> 01:16:08.970
