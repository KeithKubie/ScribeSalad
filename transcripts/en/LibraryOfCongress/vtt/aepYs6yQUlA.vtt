&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:24.340
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: Hello.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:27.530 position:56%
I'm Gail Shirazi of the Israel
Judaica section here at the Library.

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:30.920
Welcome to LC and to
our program today

00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:34.790
on the Judische Kulturbund Project.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:37.010
Excuse my pronunciation.

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:41.300
And I'm going to just briefly
talk about some upcoming programs.

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:46.010
Our next one is on the 17th of
November here in the [inaudible],

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:48.400
and it's award winning
Israeli author

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.130
and illustrator, Alona Frankel.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:52.790
You may know her from
Once Upon a Potty.

00:00:52.790 --> 00:00:57.200
But she's also done
her memoirs called --

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:01.570 position:56%
she's written a book called Girl, My
Childhood and the Second World War.

00:01:01.570 --> 00:01:04.380
She was a hidden child
at a very young age.

00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:09.110
And these events, the series of
three events that I'm having are

00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.350
in commemoration of Kristallnacht,
the Night of the Broken Glass

00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.280
that happened November
9 and 10, 1938.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.960
Today's event is cosponsored by
the Motion Picture Broadcasting

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:26.450
and Recorded Sound
Division, European Division

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:29.520
and the Hebrew language table
here at the Library of Congress

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.650
in cooperation with the
[inaudible] Institute

00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:36.500
and the [inaudible] Chair Forum
at George Washington University.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.010
I would like to thank all the
participating organizations.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.970
I would also like to thank Audrey
Fisher in the Public Affairs Office

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:46.950
and Galina Keverovsky [assumed
spelling] at the IJ section.

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:49.850
And of course, our
presenters and formers.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:54.480
Project Director, Gail
Prensky, and the performers,

00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:58.680
soprano Sarah Baumgarten,
and our pianist,

00:01:58.680 --> 00:02:01.970
Patrick O'Donnell right there.

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.080
Sarah was actually Patrick's
student at the Peabody Institute

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:10.660
of Johns Hopkins University,
and both are education directors

00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.120
and music collaborators
of the project.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.160
The enthusiasm and passion
commitment of those involved

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:22.260
in the project was just amazing.

00:02:22.260 --> 00:02:28.040 position:56%
Gail Prensky's energy and leadership
has moved the project forward

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.890
to promote arts even in the
face of tierney and adversity.

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:35.550
And I like the quote
from her website.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.970
Power of music, resiliency

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.970
of the human spirit,
and the will to survive.

00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:45.610
It gives me great personal
and professional pleasure

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:51.540
to introduce Gail Prensky who
will introduce Sarah and Patrick.

00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:55.410 position:56%
Thank you for giving of your talents
and your time for this event.

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:59.550
And we'll have a period of
Q and A following the event.

00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:01.510
Thank you.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.500
[ Applause ]

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:13.130
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: It
is such a pleasure

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.750
to be here and thank you, Gail.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.970 position:56%
She's been a champion of the project
and really, really worked hard

00:03:19.970 --> 00:03:23.750
to bring us here and I also
want to thank the people

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.400
from the IT Department and
the Webcasting Department

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.240
to make sure all of
this works for us,

00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:33.880
so I can't blame technology
if I goof up for sure.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:37.690 position:56%
And a special hello to everyone
that's watching this on the webcast,

00:03:37.690 --> 00:03:42.940
the artists and scholars and
friends all over the world.

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:45.170
Before I start the presentation

00:03:45.170 --> 00:03:49.420
about the Judische Kulturband
Project, I just wanted to explain

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:53.230
that today is a special
format, that Sarah

00:03:53.230 --> 00:03:55.860
and Patrick will perform
a few pieces.

00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:58.540 position:56%
One before I start the presentation,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:02.560
one in the middle and
one to close it.

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.830
So Sarah's going to come up here
and talk about the first piece

00:04:06.830 --> 00:04:12.860
that they're going to perform
which is an aria Mein Herr Marquis,

00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:17.100
and after she performs --
they perform, I will begin.

00:04:17.100 --> 00:04:20.510
So come on over, Sarah.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:24.890
[ Applause ]

00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:26.190
&gt;&gt; Sarah Baumgarten:
So just to explain

00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:28.370
about the aria before we begin.

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:31.440
Mein Herr Marquis is from
the opera Die Flledermaus

00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:34.740
by Johann Strauss, and
that means the bat.

00:04:34.740 --> 00:04:40.930 position:56%
It was performed by the aria in 1935
and in this aria the chambermaid,

00:04:40.930 --> 00:04:44.640
Adele, is pretending to
be a world famous actress.

00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:49.110
She is showing off her dainty
hands and feet and perfect figure

00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:53.050
to her marquis to convince
him that she isn't the maid,

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.050
that she actually is
and reminds him of.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:04:58.030
And meanwhile, her
master, [inaudible],

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.630
is the one dressed
up as the marquis.

00:05:00.630 --> 00:05:03.870
So it's all very confusing.

00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:07.460 position:56%
Both are longing to be someone
they're not, which I'm sure the Jews

00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:10.070
in Germany at that
time could relate to

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:14.140
and which is why I suspect they put
on this opera that year to comment

00:05:14.140 --> 00:05:17.190
on the political happenings
going on around them but also

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:20.830
to allow the performers and the
audience a chance to pretend

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:25.510 position:56%
that things were still all right for
them and with a little bit of humor.

00:05:25.510 --> 00:08:42.510
[ Singing ]

00:08:42.510 --> 00:08:54.590
[ Applause ]

00:08:54.590 --> 00:08:56.890
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: Wow.

00:09:00.030 --> 00:09:07.000
So as I was saying, I am so
pleased to be here today to share

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.030
with you this presentation about
the Judische Kulturbund Porject.

00:09:12.030 --> 00:09:16.480
It's a project I founded years
ago to tell the story of artists

00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:22.820 position:56%
and musicians responding to
oppression in the most powerful ways

00:09:22.820 --> 00:09:25.830
through their art and music.

00:09:25.830 --> 00:09:29.630
And I really love telling
this story.

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:36.990
About 15 years ago, I learned
about the story of Jewish musicians

00:09:36.990 --> 00:09:42.170
and performing artists in Berlin
in 1933 when they were fired

00:09:42.170 --> 00:09:45.760
from their jobs in places
like the [inaudible],

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:49.170
the Berlin Philharmonic,
and the state opera.

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:52.360
They were fired because
they were Jews.

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:57.900 position:56%
A small group of Jewish artists met,
and what they decided in response

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:01.570
to their being fired
was extraordinary.

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:06.220
Led by Kurt Singer, the artistic
director, they would propose

00:10:06.220 --> 00:10:10.780
to the Nazi that they organize
their own cultural association

00:10:10.780 --> 00:10:12.520
for Jews only.

00:10:12.520 --> 00:10:16.850
They would be self-sustaining
through membership subscriptions.

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.300 position:56%
Kurt Singer delivered their proposal

00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.120
to Joseph Gerble's
[assumed spelling] office

00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:23.830
of propaganda and enlightenment.

00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:28.580
Surprisingly, the Nazis
approved the proposal.

00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:32.390
The Kulturbund understood that
the Nazis would oversee their

00:10:32.390 --> 00:10:37.040
organization and approve
of all their activities.

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:42.300
And so in 1933, the
Kulturbund Deutscher Juden,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:46.160
the Jewish Cultural League
of German Jews, was born.

00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:53.510
And in 1936, the Nazis told the
Kulturbund to remove Deutscher,

00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:56.630
German, from the organization's
name.

00:10:56.630 --> 00:11:00.910
And so they became known
as the Judische Kulturbund,

00:11:00.910 --> 00:11:03.690
the Jewish Cultural Association.

00:11:03.690 --> 00:11:06.810
Now, I just showed you a
series of these pictures.

00:11:06.810 --> 00:11:09.750
They were actually
painted by a young woman,

00:11:09.750 --> 00:11:12.440
a teenager named Charlotte
Solomon who is

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:16.280
from a prominent Jewish family
in Berlin, and her stepmother,

00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:20.630
Paula Lindberg, was an opera
singer in the Kulturbund.

00:11:20.630 --> 00:11:23.690
They sent her -- her father
and stepmother sent her

00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:27.680
to southern France where her
grandfather lived to hide

00:11:27.680 --> 00:11:32.680
between 1940 and '43 when she
painted hundreds of paintings

00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:34.640
about her life in Berlin.

00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:37.850
And some of them were
of the Kulturbund.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:44.480
Charlotte and her unborn child
were perished in Auschwitz in 1943.

00:11:44.480 --> 00:11:51.120
When the Kulturbund started in
1933, it opened in Berlin then soon

00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:55.800
after opened in 42
theaters around Germany.

00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:58.570
The Kulturbund performed operas,

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:00.660
[inaudible], symphonies
and cabarets.

00:12:00.660 --> 00:12:04.870
Some of the finest
musicians in German remember.

00:12:04.870 --> 00:12:09.130
To give you an idea of the
size of the organization,

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:11.780
they hired about 2000 artists.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:13.420
Hannah is one of them.

00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:17.350
And their membership swelled
to about 70,000 people.

00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:22.620
At its height in 1937,
there were 18,500 members

00:12:22.620 --> 00:12:24.860
in the Berlin Kulturbund alone.

00:12:24.860 --> 00:12:29.160
More than ten percent of
the Jewish population there.

00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.640
Since I learned the story, I
am still amazed by the idea

00:12:32.640 --> 00:12:35.890
of artists responding to
their expulsion from jobs

00:12:35.890 --> 00:12:40.850
in their homeland by organizing
as they did and then perplexed

00:12:40.850 --> 00:12:42.750
by the Nazi's sanctioning
their plan.

00:12:42.750 --> 00:12:47.540
On the one hand, the formation
of the Kulturbund was an act

00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:50.610
of defiance by the Jewish artists.

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:51.910
And for some of the artists,

00:12:51.910 --> 00:12:55.080
they thought that they were
safe performing in a haven away

00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:58.680
from the darkness covering
outside the theater.

00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:02.450
For the Nazis, we believe
that the Kulturbund was used

00:13:02.450 --> 00:13:06.200
as a propaganda tool to tell the
world the Jews are doing fine

00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:10.750
and perhaps it was a way for
the Nazis to contain the Jews.

00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:15.230
It was certainly the beginning
of marginalizing, repressing

00:13:15.230 --> 00:13:18.880
and ultimately squeezing
them out of society.

00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:20.180
For the Kulturbund,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:24.290
did it ultimately prevent some
artists from leaving sooner?

00:13:24.290 --> 00:13:28.000
Did it provide them with
a false sense of security?

00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.840
Or did it succeed in defying
the Nazis and provide a way

00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:34.890
for many artists to survive?

00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:38.610
Maybe the Kulturbund
were all of these things.

00:13:38.610 --> 00:13:42.430
I started this project to
capture these Kulturbund artists'

00:13:42.430 --> 00:13:44.340
experiences and issues

00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:48.120
and to explore how the
Kulturbund is relevant today.

00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:53.010
My first task was to interview as
many survivors as I could locate.

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.850
I filmed 15 interviews.

00:13:54.850 --> 00:13:57.820
Most of these subjects
have since died.

00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:01.200
One of those I interviewed
attended a Kulturbund performance.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:04.400
She remembers seeing
Barbara Seville.

00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.230
I interviewed performers, an
actor, a dancer choreographer,

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:11.230
Hannah, and several musicians.

00:14:11.230 --> 00:14:15.180
And I interviewed a seamstress
who altered the same costumes over

00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:19.000
and over again for
many performances.

00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:22.350
These interviews were very moving

00:14:22.350 --> 00:14:26.130
as the subjects described their
memories living in Germany,

00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:27.890
their experiences in the Kulturbund

00:14:27.890 --> 00:14:31.950
and the performances
in which they played.

00:14:31.950 --> 00:14:35.800
A common theme for all of them,
which Gail had said before,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:38.430
the power of music, the resiliency

00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:43.250
of the human spirit and
the will to survive.

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:48.700
So Hannah was a choreographer
and a dancer

00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:53.040
in the Berlin Kulturbund
in 1938 and '39.

00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:56.480
She and her parents fled Germany

00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:00.690
for New York before the Nazis
stopped giving out Visas.

00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:03.250
After settling in America,

00:15:03.250 --> 00:15:05.920
Hannah founded the Hannah Koner
[assumed spelling] Dance Studio

00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:07.400
in Long Island.

00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.040
Hannah passed away last
year at the age of 95.

00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.540
Her legacy continues
through her children

00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:18.120 position:56%
and proteges in the U.S. and abroad.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:22.660
So to start her story,
I wanted to share

00:15:22.660 --> 00:15:26.300
with you a film interview excerpt.

00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.050
&gt;&gt; As the years went on, the world
of the Jews became [inaudible]

00:15:30.050 --> 00:15:35.640
and really there was no
way that anY Jew will end

00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:42.410
up in Berlin [inaudible] for
the whole country was able to go

00:15:42.410 --> 00:15:45.640
to any theater or to any movie.

00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:51.640
No television was here and radio
was only what the Nazis chose

00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:53.230
to present.

00:15:53.230 --> 00:15:57.510
So our world was totally
void of entertainment

00:15:57.510 --> 00:16:03.790
and the Kulturbund was
this in its best form.

00:16:03.790 --> 00:16:08.420
I would like to nowadays
tell people that if something

00:16:08.420 --> 00:16:13.680
like this would happen in
this country, God forbid,

00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:17.790
I'd imagine that all the top
artists of Lincoln Center,

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:24.050
the Metropolitan Opera House,
movies, books, if everyone who is

00:16:24.050 --> 00:16:29.600
of Jewish religion or had one
Jewish grandparent would be totally

00:16:29.600 --> 00:16:33.440
prohibited to [inaudible]
their profession.

00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:38.670
And those people pulled themselves
together and formed the Kulturbund.

00:16:38.670 --> 00:16:42.750
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: Artists
of the Kulturbund

00:16:42.750 --> 00:16:46.480
like Hannah impacted not just
German and Jewish culture

00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:48.720
but culture in other lands.

00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:51.190
I want to share some of
these artists with you.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:54.840
I will also share video
excerpts of contemporary concerts

00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:58.090
that represent some of the
music the Kulturbund artists

00:16:58.090 --> 00:16:59.700
remember performing.

00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:03.440
I also want to add that for
each piece shared with you,

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.400
these music compositions tell
stories and represent themes

00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.800
such as freedom, defiance
and resiliency.

00:17:11.800 --> 00:17:14.570
I can only guess that the
Kulturbund selected them

00:17:14.570 --> 00:17:18.470
because of their significance,
their meaning.

00:17:19.650 --> 00:17:21.750
Arence [assumed spelling]
Leonard was an actor

00:17:21.750 --> 00:17:26.090
who joined the Berlin
Kulturbund in 1933.

00:17:26.090 --> 00:17:28.870
Soon after Arence joined
the Kulturbund,

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.470
he performed in their first
production in October,

00:17:31.470 --> 00:17:37.140
1933 in the theater on
[inaudible] in Berlin.

00:17:37.140 --> 00:17:43.040 position:56%
It was a play called Nathan the Wise
written by Gotthold Ephraim Lessing.

00:17:43.040 --> 00:17:48.400
Nathan the Wise is a story about
religious tolerance among Muslims,

00:17:48.400 --> 00:17:53.200
Christians and Jews in Jerusalem
during the 12th century's

00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:55.180
third crusade.

00:17:55.180 --> 00:17:58.450
When the Nazis saw the
performance, they shut it down,

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:01.850
never allowing the
Kulturbund to perform it again.

00:18:01.850 --> 00:18:06.010
In 1936, Arence left for New York

00:18:06.010 --> 00:18:08.630
where he met William
Morris, the agent.

00:18:08.630 --> 00:18:12.930
Then he moved to Hollywood where
he acted and became a photographer,

00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.480
devleoping the first screen tests.

00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.750
His first client was Tony Curtis.

00:18:19.750 --> 00:18:24.030
His last performance in
2004, a year before he died,

00:18:24.030 --> 00:18:28.550
was a German Israeli
co-production called Walk on Water.

00:18:28.550 --> 00:18:30.500
He called me when he got the part.

00:18:30.500 --> 00:18:35.390
He was so excited about the
opportunity to be in a movie again.

00:18:35.390 --> 00:18:43.260
"Imagine the irony, he said, I am
playing, wait, a Nazi perpetrator."

00:18:43.260 --> 00:18:46.150
And we laughed.

00:18:46.150 --> 00:18:49.360
Yuri Tepletts [assumed spelling]
was a flutist joining the Frankfurt

00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:52.030
Kulturbund in 1934.

00:18:52.030 --> 00:18:53.670
One of the first performances

00:18:53.670 --> 00:18:57.450
in which he played was
Mendelson's violin concerto.

00:18:57.450 --> 00:19:01.470
It was a special piece because
the German orchestras no longer

00:19:01.470 --> 00:19:03.650
played Mendelson.

00:19:03.650 --> 00:19:06.270
The reason was that
the orchestra's --

00:19:06.270 --> 00:19:09.250
the reason that the orchestra
did not play Mendelson is

00:19:09.250 --> 00:19:12.790
because the Nazis believed
he was a Jew.

00:19:12.790 --> 00:19:17.650
While Mendelson's family were
Jewish, he was baptized Christian.

00:19:17.650 --> 00:19:21.450
It did not matter his
blood line was Jewish.

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:24.820
I'm going to share
with you now an excerpt

00:19:24.820 --> 00:19:28.850
of Mendelson's violin concerto,
and [inaudible] is on violin

00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:31.790
and Curt Mazer [assumed

00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:06.800
In 1936, Yuri left
for Palestine along

00:21:06.800 --> 00:21:10.850 position:56%
with conductor William Steinberg and
others from the Frankfurt Kulturbund

00:21:10.850 --> 00:21:16.960
to help start the Bronislaw
Hooverman's Palestine Symphony

00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:21.890
Orchestra, which is today
the Israeli Philharmonic.

00:21:21.890 --> 00:21:23.800
Margalite Waxman [assumed
spelling] was the daughter

00:21:23.800 --> 00:21:28.160
of the founding artistic director
of the Kulturbund Kurt Singer.

00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:32.490
She attended many of her father's
concerts and remembers in '36

00:21:32.490 --> 00:21:37.020
when the Kulturbund began
performing Yiddish plays and music.

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:39.750
This was an extraordinary event.

00:21:39.750 --> 00:21:44.040
Up until that time, the Kulturbund
played music by the great composers

00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:49.100
of Europe, Bach, Beethoven, Bram,
Schubert, [inaudible] and Mozart.

00:21:49.100 --> 00:21:52.550
But in '36, the Nazis
instructed the Kulturbund

00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:56.660
that they could no longer
play music -- I'm sorry --

00:21:56.660 --> 00:22:02.700
perform music or dramas
composed by Austrians or Germans.

00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.690
The play only works by
Jewish or foreign composers.

00:22:06.690 --> 00:22:09.250
Beethoven, Mozart and
Haydn were out.

00:22:09.250 --> 00:22:12.550
Moller and Mendelson were in.

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:14.460
They needed to expand
their repertoire

00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:17.710
so they started researching and
learning about Yiddish music

00:22:17.710 --> 00:22:21.350
and dramas about which
they knew little.

00:22:21.350 --> 00:22:23.830
One such piece was a
liturgical song, [inaudible].

00:22:23.830 --> 00:22:28.660
[Inaudible] performing [inaudible]
in Amsterdam's Portuguese --

00:22:28.660 --> 00:22:35.430
Amsterdam's Portuguese Synagog.

00:22:36.510 --> 00:24:38.130
[ Music ]

00:24:38.130 --> 00:24:41.050
Wasn't it great?

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:45.160 position:56%
Margalite's father, Kurt Singer,
was passionate about the Kulturbund.

00:24:45.160 --> 00:24:49.620
In fact, he believed that he
and the Kulturbund were special

00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.010
and protected by the Nazis.

00:24:52.010 --> 00:24:55.790
In 1938, he left Berlin for
the Netherlands and then went

00:24:55.790 --> 00:25:01.340
on to the United States to visit
his sister and lecturer at Harvard.

00:25:01.340 --> 00:25:05.530
Singer was also lecturing in New
York's Young Hebrew Association

00:25:05.530 --> 00:25:09.340
and was given an offer
for a permanent post

00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.380
at Yale, which he turned down.

00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.380
He couldn't shake his
commitment to the Kulturbund

00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.950
and wanted to return to Berlin.

00:25:16.950 --> 00:25:18.560
The actor, Aaron Flenard
[assumed spelling],

00:25:18.560 --> 00:25:21.120
visited him in New York
telling Singer about [inaudible]

00:25:21.120 --> 00:25:28.170
and begged him to stay in the U.S.
Singer told his friend he must go

00:25:28.170 --> 00:25:31.010
back, "to rescue what
could be rescued."

00:25:31.010 --> 00:25:34.400
On his way to Germany,
Singer stopped

00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:36.580
in Holland to see his friends.

00:25:36.580 --> 00:25:39.900
They persuaded him not
to return to Germany.

00:25:39.900 --> 00:25:42.400
He realized that Kulturbund
could not survive,

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:45.720 position:56%
and he decided to stay in Amsterdam.

00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:49.300
After the Nazi's occupation in
Holland, Singer tried to return

00:25:49.300 --> 00:25:52.090
to the U.S., but he
couldn't get a Visa.

00:25:52.090 --> 00:25:53.990
Eventually, he was
sent to [inaudible]

00:25:53.990 --> 00:25:56.610
where he died from illness.

00:25:56.610 --> 00:26:00.260
Margalite, her mother and
sister immigrated to Jerusalem.

00:26:00.260 --> 00:26:04.790
Singer's grandchildren and great
grandchildren lived there today.

00:26:04.790 --> 00:26:10.560
Today, we are remembering
November 10, 1938, the second day

00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.290
of Kristallnacht, the
Night of Broken Glass.

00:26:14.290 --> 00:26:18.310 position:56%
Terror swept through Germany setting
synagogues on fire, killing hundreds

00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:22.480
of Jews, closing the businesses
and schools and sending tens

00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.830
of thousands of Jews
to concentration camps.

00:26:25.830 --> 00:26:31.290
But imagine, three days after
Kristallnacht on November 13,

00:26:31.290 --> 00:26:34.150
the Kulturbund reopened
its theaters.

00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:37.600
Max Ehrlich and Willie Rosen
resurrected the cabaret

00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:41.300
and comedy review they had
been running since October.

00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:44.900
This must have been an
exhilarating and uplifting event

00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.440
for the Jewish performers
and audience.

00:26:47.440 --> 00:26:53.190
Willie Rosen said, "One takes a
thin comedian and a fat comic.

00:26:53.190 --> 00:26:55.380
One adds a few pounds."

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:59.560
I need to go back one.

00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:06.950
Okay. "One takes a thin
comedian and a fat comic.

00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:09.050 position:56%
One adds a few pounds of sex appeal.

00:27:09.050 --> 00:27:12.120
One adds a few comprehensible
melodies

00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:14.860
which the audience can
sing after the show.

00:27:14.860 --> 00:27:19.120
One adds a few old jokes from
which you cut off the beards.

00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:22.740
One takes a lot of new jokes
and some ornaments, red,

00:27:22.740 --> 00:27:25.710
green and blue lights,
blend them all together

00:27:25.710 --> 00:27:27.340
and the review is done."

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.270
Hence, they named the cabaret

00:27:29.270 --> 00:27:33.520
and the comedy review
Gemischtes Kompolt,

00:27:33.520 --> 00:27:36.300
which means mixed fruit cocktail.

00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:42.780
Now, Sarah and Patrick will do
another performance for you,

00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:48.400
and this will be what
good would the moon be.

00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:51.550
I don't know how you're going
to say it in the other language,

00:27:51.550 --> 00:27:53.800
but it is a cabaret
song written by one

00:27:53.800 --> 00:27:56.510
of Germany's great
20th century composers,

00:27:56.510 --> 00:28:01.380
Kurt Vile who was a target of the
Nazis early on fleeing Germany

00:28:01.380 --> 00:28:04.450
in March, 1933 for Paris.

00:28:04.450 --> 00:28:06.750
Come on up.

00:28:12.210 --> 00:28:13.720
&gt;&gt; Sarah Baumbarten: So Kurt
Vile's [inaudible] premiered

00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:17.260
on Broadway in 1947.

00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.490
Therefore, it was not
performed by the Kulturbund.

00:28:20.490 --> 00:28:25.060
However, Vile's music was well
represented on their many programs.

00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:28.020
The aria, What Good Would the
Moon Be, addresses the importance

00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.530
of love over material things.

00:28:30.530 --> 00:28:34.450
After all, love is what
makes life worthwhile.

00:28:34.450 --> 00:28:37.730
In our context, this aria helps
us to realize that without love,

00:28:37.730 --> 00:28:41.570
the Judischle Kulturbund
would not have even existed.

00:28:41.570 --> 00:28:44.500
Because so many had a
love of music and followed

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:47.840
through with keeping it accessible,
hundreds, perhaps thousands

00:28:47.840 --> 00:28:50.160
of people were able to trudge
through the years leading

00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:53.460
up to the Holocaust with
hope instead of with fear.

00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:56.970
So enjoy What Good
Would the Moon Be.

Henry met the conductor of the
Berlin Kulturbund, Rudolf Schwartz,

00:31:40.010 --> 00:31:43.980
at a bus stop in Berlin one
day and was invited to audition

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:46.470
for the Kulturbund orchestra.

of Kulturbund conducted
by Rudolf Schwartz.

00:32:00.590 --> 00:32:04.760
Nielsen wrote in his notes that
the symphony applies to that

00:32:04.760 --> 00:32:09.090
which is inextinguishable
and the will to live,

00:32:09.090 --> 00:32:13.070
which made it appropriate for the
Kulturbund to play the symphony

00:32:13.070 --> 00:32:19.590
on the day the organization
closed on September 11, 1941.

00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:06.130 position:56%
to the Nazi's oppression, repression
and near extinction, today's artists

00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:12.280
around the world also respond to
their oppression through their art.

00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.230
Malika Serabi [assumed
spelling] is one

00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.990 position:56%
of those artists who lives in India.

00:34:16.990 --> 00:34:21.810
She is an actor, a dancer,
an activist, what she likes

00:34:21.810 --> 00:34:24.430
to call herself an artivist.

00:34:24.430 --> 00:34:26.810
Malika is a champion, working

00:34:26.810 --> 00:34:29.940
with those cast aside
called The Untouchables,

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:34.920
and fights for the rights of the
underdog through her performance,

00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:41.480
art and other activities for which
she has won many honors in India.

00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:46.510
Here is a sample of an interview
that I did with Malika in 2014.

00:34:46.510 --> 00:34:48.910
&gt;&gt; I just have continued
[inaudible] or just

00:34:48.910 --> 00:34:53.970
to say we do not accept
what is happening.

00:34:53.970 --> 00:35:02.630
And the early Jewish artists
during the Nazi regimen

00:35:02.630 --> 00:35:06.580
with which this project
started were doing that.

00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:08.680
They were saying there
is a beauty in music

00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:11.910
that goes beyond the [inaudible]
of the world around us.

00:35:11.910 --> 00:35:15.190
Beyond that the artists in
many different regimens,

00:35:15.190 --> 00:35:19.320
are actually using their art to
protest against the government

00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:23.210
in much more open ways,
and I think many

00:35:23.210 --> 00:35:25.790 position:56%
of us feel isolated from each other.

00:35:25.790 --> 00:35:29.620
We don't know who it is in
Afghanistan was doing similar work

00:35:29.620 --> 00:35:31.680
or who it is in Nigeria
who is doing similar work.

00:35:31.680 --> 00:35:34.230
And I think that this project
can bring those together

00:35:34.230 --> 00:35:35.590
in one platform.

00:35:35.590 --> 00:35:42.970
We will be creating a sorority
or fraternity of people

00:35:42.970 --> 00:35:45.440
who know are not alone, and I think
that's why this is so important.

00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:51.080
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: We want to explore
how artists today might connect

00:35:51.080 --> 00:35:54.540
to the Kulturbund and the issues
they face, the choice to stay

00:35:54.540 --> 00:36:00.380 position:56%
or leave their homeland and what the
ramifications of their choice means.

00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:03.080
We also want to look at
the issue of identity

00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:06.110
and the power of music and art.

00:36:06.110 --> 00:36:12.040
We have talked with 34 artists from
22 countries including Afghanistan,

00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:18.570 position:56%

Chile, Congo DRC, India, Iran, Mali,

Niger, North Korea,
Pakistan, Shrilanka,

00:36:21.880 --> 00:36:24.740
Sweden, Uganda and Ukraine.

00:36:24.740 --> 00:36:27.110
While the Nazis did not
allow the Kulturbund

00:36:27.110 --> 00:36:30.260
to film their performances
or record their music,

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.130
today we have the advantage
of technology and social media

00:36:34.130 --> 00:36:39.960 position:56%
that break down the barriers
despite dictator's efforts to squash

00:36:39.960 --> 00:36:45.860
or quash their attempts to let
the outside world know about them.

00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.790
I'd like to share with you examples

00:36:47.790 --> 00:36:52.410

who worked outsidse the home and
three, working as performing artists

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:24.580
which is akin to those in
Afghanistan as being prostitutes.

00:37:24.580 --> 00:37:26.610
Minera's mother encouraged
her daughters

00:37:26.610 --> 00:37:29.150

00:37:56.730 --> 00:38:00.930
The Stars, which she wrote
after she moved to Sweden.

00:38:00.930 --> 00:38:04.680
It is a story about three women
and their sufferings in Afghanistan

00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:08.610
from 130 years ago to now.

00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:24.900
they targeted artists
sending them to the camps

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:27.270
and killing many of them.

00:38:27.270 --> 00:38:30.860

Tin Lin began painting as a boy,
attending [inaudible] University

00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.410

He was political prisoner
from 1998 until 2004.

00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:46.260
While confined often in solitary
confinement in the Mandolay prison,

00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.510
Tin Lin persuaded guards with whom
he became friendly to purchase

00:39:50.510 --> 00:39:53.160
and smuggle in paints for him.

00:39:53.160 --> 00:39:58.180
He used items in the prison like
bowls, syringes, cigarette lighters

00:39:58.180 --> 00:40:03.580
in the absence of brushes to make
paintings and monoprints of cotton,

00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:06.320
prison uniforms like this.

00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:12.850 position:56%
Working at night and for two hours
at a time while friendly guards were

00:40:12.850 --> 00:40:18.280
on duty, he used bars of soap
and sculpted images of cellmates

00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.210
and painted the prison surroundings

00:40:20.210 --> 00:40:23.710
and the suffering faces
of fellow prisoners.

00:40:23.710 --> 00:40:28.880
Tin Lin successfully arranged to
smuggle more than 300 paintings

00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:32.840
and sculptures out of the
prison, which were later deposited

00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:36.810
in the International Institute

was installed in Mandolay Hall in

The installation based on
Tin Lin's written story

00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:04.130
about his sentencing
in the Mandolay prison.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:10.800
In July, 2013, Tin Lin returned
with his family to live in Burma

00:41:10.800 --> 00:41:14.860
to take advantage of the
new reforms in his country.

00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:19.740 position:56%
He is currently working on a show of
hands capturing in plaster the hands

00:41:19.740 --> 00:41:23.610
of thousands of former
political prisoners in Burma.

00:41:23.610 --> 00:41:27.270
So far, he has completed
more than 400.

00:41:27.270 --> 00:41:31.560
The show of hands represents how
Burma was once broken and now

00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.030
in the process of healing, and
it is also about the process

00:41:35.030 --> 00:41:39.770
of engaging the community through
performance and public art.

00:41:39.770 --> 00:41:42.290
This was Johan Belmar

00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:57.410
of Pinochet in the
1970's, 80's and 90's.

00:41:57.410 --> 00:41:59.920
His mother worked in a factory.

00:41:59.920 --> 00:42:02.650
One day Johan remembers
walking over a bridge

00:42:02.650 --> 00:42:04.910
where he saw bodies floating.

00:42:04.910 --> 00:42:09.320
As he got older, aware that he
was gay and had a strong design

00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.770
and artistic talent, he knew he
was going to have to leave Chile

00:42:13.770 --> 00:42:17.750
because the penalty for
homosexuality was death.

00:42:17.750 --> 00:42:21.550
Expressing one's artistic
ideas was risky.

00:42:21.550 --> 00:42:27.070
In 1995, leaving his homeland
and his family, he fled to Spain

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:30.360

freedom for the first time.

This was during the
Kim Il Sung's rule.

00:44:01.450 --> 00:44:05.340
One day the authorities arrested
and took away her husband.

00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.860
A month later, she was taken

00:44:06.860 --> 00:44:11.150
to a national security agency
building for interrogation.

00:44:11.150 --> 00:44:13.720
There, she was told to
write a notebook everything

00:44:13.720 --> 00:44:16.830
about her life and
everyone she knew.

00:44:16.830 --> 00:44:20.800
After two months, she and
her family, her parents

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:22.160
and four children were sent

00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:25.070
to a concentration camp called
Yodak [assumed spelling].

00:44:25.070 --> 00:44:27.680
Her parents died of malnutrition.

After nine years, she and
her two surviving children,

00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:44.600
a son and daughter, were released.

00:44:44.600 --> 00:44:49.410 position:56%
She adopted out her teenage daughter
to a farmer for a better life.

00:44:49.410 --> 00:44:53.550
Years later, she learned why she
was sent to the concentration camp.

00:44:53.550 --> 00:44:57.530
She knew a secret that no one
was to know, which she revealed

00:44:57.530 --> 00:45:00.340
in those interrogation notes.

00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:01.990
She was friends with an actress

00:45:01.990 --> 00:45:05.400
who had become the
mistress of Kim Yun Il.

00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:08.310
And who later gave birth to a son

00:45:08.310 --> 00:45:11.240

North Korean's dictator,

00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:14.730
Kim Yun Un's older half brother.

00:45:14.730 --> 00:45:19.040
15 years since her release from the
Yoda concentration camp, Yung Seun

choreographed a dance as part

00:45:30.420 --> 00:45:35.340
When I asked Yung Seun now in
her 70's how she can survive

00:45:35.340 --> 00:45:41.510
so much pain and loss, she said
that every day she embraces freedom

00:45:41.510 --> 00:45:43.950

00:45:46.540 --> 00:45:49.440
for the rights of North Koreans.

00:45:49.440 --> 00:45:53.030
Tarika Kenneth Desiree [assumed
spelling] is a performing artist

00:45:53.030 --> 00:45:54.940
living in Uganda.

00:45:54.940 --> 00:45:58.590
Today, Ugandans are
experiencing increased oppression

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:02.720
with the parliament passing a law
allowing police more power while

00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:05.250
restricting people's rights.

00:46:05.250 --> 00:46:09.460
People are not allowed to gather
in public places or express dissent

00:46:09.460 --> 00:46:12.220
or criticism of their government.

00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:16.000
Police may use firearms to
shoot and kill protestors

00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.110
and bystanders in demonstrations.

00:46:19.110 --> 00:46:23.020
Media outlets are targeted and
closed down and threats are made

00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:25.070
against civil society groups

00:46:25.070 --> 00:46:29.840
and journalists whose work involve
government policy and human rights,

00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:32.510
particularly the rights
of lesbian, gay,

00:46:32.510 --> 00:46:36.600
bisexual and transgender people.

00:46:36.600 --> 00:46:39.420
Tarika shared examples of
how the mandate was used

00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:41.830
against people where he lives.

00:46:41.830 --> 00:46:46.800
In 20 -- I'm sorry, in June, 2010,
Tarika was part of an audience

00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:50.640
that was watching some documentary
films in the Witoto [ph] Church

00:46:50.640 --> 00:46:56.150
about human rights when police
targeted the church and raided it,

00:46:56.150 --> 00:46:59.000
blocking the screening of
the film about the trial

00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.970
of the prominent leaders
of the defeated Nazis

00:47:01.970 --> 00:47:04.920
in Germany after World War II.

00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:08.140
In October, 2012, The
State of the Nation,

00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.690
a production by a local playwright,
John Sigarwa [assumed spelling],

00:47:11.690 --> 00:47:16.730
was deemed incisive and
a threat to patriotism.

00:47:16.730 --> 00:47:19.750
Because it highlighted
critical issues like corruption

00:47:19.750 --> 00:47:21.930
and the governance in Uganda,

00:47:21.930 --> 00:47:25.780
the play was banned
immediately after its premiere.

00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:30.440
Tarika is a professional dancer and
choreographer as well as founder

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:33.770
of the Yeda Convicts
[ph] Dance Company.

00:47:33.770 --> 00:47:37.770
Started in 2006, Yeda
Convicts mission is

00:47:37.770 --> 00:47:40.500
to transform society through dance.

00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:42.580
Through dance, performances
communicate

00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:46.900
and educate the audiences about
the things that affect society

00:47:46.900 --> 00:47:50.810
and in Uganda there
is so much to say.

00:47:52.380 --> 00:47:56.270
We are asked a lot about what the
Judischle Kulturbund Project is

00:47:56.270 --> 00:47:58.210
doing with all that we have learned

00:47:58.210 --> 00:48:01.360
about the Kulturbund
and today's artists.

00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:05.490
Well, I'd love to share
some of what we're doing.

00:48:05.490 --> 00:48:08.840
In collaboration with an
extraordinary creative team

00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:15.370
and supportive scholars and
advisors, we are producing Playing

00:48:15.370 --> 00:48:19.510
for Life, Art Under Tyranny, a
multimedia play we hope to premiere

00:48:19.510 --> 00:48:23.520
in D.C. The production brings
together characters based

00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.820
on the Kulturbund and current
day artists, musicians,

00:48:26.820 --> 00:48:29.670
actors and dancers
that magically meet

00:48:29.670 --> 00:48:32.450
on stage through time and space.

00:48:32.450 --> 00:48:35.070
We have started development
of a dramatic feature film

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:39.390
about the Kulturbund, and we
are calling it Life or Theater,

00:48:39.390 --> 00:48:42.100
which is set in Berlin
in the 1930's.

00:48:42.100 --> 00:48:43.400
As I speak right now,

00:48:43.400 --> 00:48:47.450
our screenwriter is writing
the first draft of the movie

00:48:47.450 --> 00:48:50.360
so I don't want to
reveal too much about it.

00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:53.330
We are also building
an education program.

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:55.730
We have ideas for working
with teachers and kids

00:48:55.730 --> 00:48:59.080
that include connecting
classrooms in the U.S. and abroad

00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:01.210
where we explore issues
of oppression

00:49:01.210 --> 00:49:03.950 position:56%
and responses through art and music.

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:08.940
We are also planning with the
[inaudible] Jewish Day School

00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:13.880 position:56%
and the Musicians for World Harmony,
a series of kids music videos.

00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:17.820
And we have an idea for a book and
exhibition that features profiles

00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:21.360
of our artists and children's
response to the artist's story

00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:24.870
through their written
word, visual art and music.

00:49:24.870 --> 00:49:28.340
We continue to find new
artists and audiences

00:49:28.340 --> 00:49:30.100
who connect with our efforts.

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:34.340 position:56%
In September, I was in Sweden giving
a presentation at a conference

00:49:34.340 --> 00:49:37.110
about culture and freedom
of expression.

00:49:37.110 --> 00:49:40.020
While there, for a couple of weeks,

00:49:40.020 --> 00:49:42.380
we found Heda [assumed
spelling] Krauss.

00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:44.110
She is a Swedish playwright.

00:49:44.110 --> 00:49:49.680
He's storytelling to
expose oppression of women

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.900
and is working ona performance
right now about the wrongs

00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.890
of the Roma people which
is an initiative supported

00:49:57.890 --> 00:50:00.030
by the Swedish government.

00:50:00.030 --> 00:50:03.070
And we interviewed two refugees.

00:50:03.070 --> 00:50:06.110
Hollad Herrara [assumed spelling],
a [inaudible] rapper who is working

00:50:06.110 --> 00:50:09.090
in Sweden on music programs
for kids in his homeland

00:50:09.090 --> 00:50:13.240
and is also planning
a music academy there,

00:50:13.240 --> 00:50:16.110
and Assad Budda [assumed
spelling] a [inaudible] historian

00:50:16.110 --> 00:50:21.560 position:56%
and philosopher from Afghanistan who
feels a deep affinity for Judaism,

00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:26.540
and was fired from a university
position in Afghanistan for sharing

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:30.630
with his students his connection to
the Jew's history, their struggles,

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:35.830
strong sense of identity and
ability to overcome adversity.

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:39.540
More than 1000 fatwas have
been issued against him,

00:50:39.540 --> 00:50:42.050
and his Visa's running out.

00:50:42.050 --> 00:50:46.220
He can't return to Afghanistan
because he will be stoned to death.

00:50:46.220 --> 00:50:50.300
He told us after our interview,
"Your work is a constellatoin,

00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:53.330
drawing stars in the dark sky.

00:50:53.330 --> 00:50:57.170
I am darkness and trying to
connect you to the Hazara artists,

00:50:57.170 --> 00:51:01.390
the starsof Afghan-Persian
dark history."

00:51:01.390 --> 00:51:08.060
Through all of our various
efforts, we will tell you the story

00:51:08.060 --> 00:51:11.140
of the Kulturbund and
those of today's artists

00:51:11.140 --> 00:51:14.770
and how they responded living
under oppression, spanning the time

00:51:14.770 --> 00:51:17.500
from 1933 to the present.

00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:21.930 position:56%
I want to thank you all for allowing
me to share the faces, the music,

00:51:21.930 --> 00:51:26.900
the art and the stories of the
artists who define our project.

00:51:26.900 --> 00:51:29.410
They motivate me every day.

00:51:29.410 --> 00:51:32.110
These artists are brave,
generous and appreciative

00:51:32.110 --> 00:51:35.360
of what we were doing
for them on our project.

00:51:35.360 --> 00:51:40.110 position:56%
We are grateful to them for allowing
us to share our stories with you.

00:51:40.110 --> 00:51:44.480 position:56%
Our project's desire is to introduce
you and others to the Kulturbund

00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:47.490
and today's artists and
show you how they respond

00:51:47.490 --> 00:51:48.810
to oppression through art.

00:51:48.810 --> 00:51:52.820
It is our hope that through the
Judische Kulturbund Project's

00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:57.100
efforts we will bring a collective
voice for today's artists as well

00:51:57.100 --> 00:52:01.590
as bring awareness about what
others are experiencing elsewhere.

00:52:01.590 --> 00:52:05.680
We believe these artists are the
best of humanity and encourage all

00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.870
of us to be tolerant of our
differences, live in peace,

00:52:09.870 --> 00:52:14.860 position:56%
allow us to express ourselves freely
and support healthy discussions

00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:18.510
about issues without
threatening our lives.

00:52:18.510 --> 00:52:22.850
Now,we will enjoy the last
performance of Sarah and Patrick,

00:52:22.850 --> 00:52:28.960
and I believe it is
Ah, I Want to Live?

00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:33.410 position:56%
And once again, just imagine what
it was like for the Kulturbund being

00:52:33.410 --> 00:52:36.860
in the theater when
this was performed.

00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:46.330
&gt;&gt; Sarah Baumgarten: This last
aria is from the French version

00:52:46.330 --> 00:52:48.510
of [inaudible] Romeo and Juliet.

00:52:48.510 --> 00:52:53.330
And the French title is [speaking
foreign language], and the English,

00:52:53.330 --> 00:52:58.640
like Gail said is Ah,
I Want to Live.

00:52:58.640 --> 00:53:00.900
This was performed by
the Judische Kulturbund

00:53:00.900 --> 00:53:04.220
in 1934, the entire opera.

00:53:04.220 --> 00:53:07.870
The first few words are I
want to live in this dream,

00:53:07.870 --> 00:53:10.880
that intoxicates me
to this day still.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.240
In our context, the Judische
Kulturbund was keeping

00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:17.220
that dream alive in the
lives of the German Jews

00:53:17.220 --> 00:53:20.540
by creating an organization
that allowed Jews to perform

00:53:20.540 --> 00:53:23.440
and experience art and
beauty through music

00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:26.020
when danger would be
lurking in every corner.

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:29.060
It became a safe haven when
things started to get ugly,

00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:32.930
and in this piece, Juliet is
about to attend her birthday ball,

00:53:32.930 --> 00:53:37.380 position:56%
but while she's excited for her
party, she's terrified of the future

00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:41.050
and growing up, of possibly
falling in love or being forced

00:53:41.050 --> 00:53:44.010
to marry a man that
she doesn't love.

00:53:44.010 --> 00:53:46.440
She's afraid to leave her
happy childhood behind

00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:51.500
for an uncertain future just as
many Jews in Germany were reluctant

00:53:51.500 --> 00:53:54.090
to leave their former lives behind.

00:53:54.090 --> 00:53:57.800
This aria also speaks to
the millions of people

00:53:57.800 --> 00:54:00.780
around the world today who are
living in oppression who just want

00:54:00.780 --> 00:54:04.770
to choose love and happiness.

00:54:04.770 --> 00:54:06.570
Enjoy [speaking foreign language].

00:54:06.570 --> 00:57:18.510
[ Singing ]

00:57:18.510 --> 00:57:40.490
[ Applause ]

00:57:40.490 --> 00:57:43.520
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: Yeah, so we're
ready for any questions, discussion

00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.170
and also you can always find
more information on our website.

00:57:47.170 --> 00:57:49.330
So please visit and help us along.

00:57:49.330 --> 00:57:55.580
Anybody want to ask
anything talked about?

00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:56.880
Yes.

00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.180
&gt;&gt; That was wonderful.

00:57:58.180 --> 00:58:01.340
It seems that the [inaudible]
was well documented

00:58:01.340 --> 00:58:02.740
as far as what was [inaudible].

00:58:02.740 --> 00:58:07.660
When you got interested in
this, where were you able

00:58:07.660 --> 00:58:13.630
to research this organization
and [inaudible]?

00:58:13.630 --> 00:58:18.550
Where are the primary
[inaudible] today?

00:58:18.550 --> 00:58:20.910
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: So the question is

00:58:20.910 --> 00:58:24.990
where are primary materials
research available

00:58:24.990 --> 00:58:26.660
for the Judische Kulturbund?

00:58:26.660 --> 00:58:27.960
And you're right.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:30.770
There were -- they were
scattered all over.

00:58:30.770 --> 00:58:34.350
Like I said, there were 42
theaters around the country.

00:58:34.350 --> 00:58:36.480
In Berlin, there was
the Academy [inaudible].

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:40.430
In New York, there was
a Leo Beck Institute,

00:58:40.430 --> 00:58:43.860
and at the Holocaust Museum,
they have some material.

00:58:43.860 --> 00:58:49.670
The people that I interviewed,
they kept material as well.

00:58:49.670 --> 00:58:54.580 position:56%
The Academy [inaudible] actually did
an exhibit, and they have a catalog

00:58:54.580 --> 00:58:57.620
where they have a listing
of all the repertoires

00:58:57.620 --> 00:59:00.120
that the Berlin Theater performs.

00:59:00.120 --> 00:59:02.780
So that was -- it was
very helpful to us.

00:59:02.780 --> 00:59:05.010
But they did not record.

00:59:05.010 --> 00:59:10.600
So there are no audio
sound or film recordings.

00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:16.510
So that's why I use these
excerpts to show the performance.

00:59:16.510 --> 00:59:26.530
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:30.310
Well, they -- so the question
is is there any effort

00:59:30.310 --> 00:59:34.030
to collect the information
from those who still survived?

00:59:34.030 --> 00:59:38.290
Most of them have since died,
but the archives, for instance,

00:59:38.290 --> 00:59:42.780
in Berlin they have given
material to them and at Leo Beck

00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:45.270
and people want my interviews

00:59:45.270 --> 00:59:49.820
so eventually I will be
sharing those with the archives.

00:59:49.820 --> 00:59:51.620
Yes.

00:59:51.620 --> 00:59:58.310
[ Inaudible ]

00:59:58.310 --> 01:00:01.980
So is there an official
archives for the --

01:00:01.980 --> 01:00:04.100
&gt;&gt; The Kulturbund in general?

01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.400 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: For the Kulturbund?

01:00:05.400 --> 01:00:13.920
Right. So the Academy [inaudible]
in Berlin has a Kulturbund archives

01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:16.040
as part of their large archives.

01:00:16.040 --> 01:00:20.770 position:56%
And you can search on there, and Leo
Beck, you can search for Kulturbund

01:00:20.770 --> 01:00:26.470
and so they do have a portion
of the archives devoted to this.

01:00:26.470 --> 01:00:27.770
Anyone else?

01:00:27.770 --> 01:00:29.070
Yes?

01:00:29.070 --> 01:00:30.730 position:56%
&gt;&gt; How did you locate the survivors?

01:00:30.730 --> 01:00:33.780
&gt;&gt; Gail Prensky: How did
I locate the survivors?

01:00:33.780 --> 01:00:36.080
So a few different places.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:42.440
I put actually an ad in
the [inaudible] Newspaper,

01:00:42.440 --> 01:00:46.140
and I got a lot of
response through them.

01:00:46.140 --> 01:00:49.420
Arence Leonard heard about
what I was doing in Germany,

01:00:49.420 --> 01:00:54.150
and he called me up and then
invited me to Berlin where we went

01:00:54.150 --> 01:00:58.240
and I visited with him a number
of times in his apartment.

01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:00.090
And word of mouth really.

01:01:00.090 --> 01:01:02.680
Oh, and the [inaudible].

01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.120
They were doing a pilot for
digitizing their archives,

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:12.040
and they gave me a grant and
sent me out there to search,

01:01:12.040 --> 01:01:17.680
and I found some people
that way too.

01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:18.980
Anyone else?

01:01:18.980 --> 01:01:20.280
Yes. Amanda.

01:01:20.280 --> 01:01:21.860
[ Inaudible ]

01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:25.130
So -- so thanks for asking.

01:01:25.130 --> 01:01:31.590
The question is how did Sweden
get involved in our project?

01:01:31.590 --> 01:01:36.290
Joann Sherman who is the
producer of Bond Street,

01:01:36.290 --> 01:01:41.960
I met her at a conference and
told her about the project,

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.880
and I was looking for
a current day artist.

01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:50.330 position:56%
And she told me about Minera Hashami
who I introduced to you earlier,

01:01:50.330 --> 01:01:53.930
an Afghan [inaudible]
perofrming artist.

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:57.420
And so I contact -- she gave
me the contact to Minera.

01:01:57.420 --> 01:02:01.770
And we did an interview
with Minera and her brother

01:02:01.770 --> 01:02:05.410
over Skype while they
were in Sweden,

01:02:05.410 --> 01:02:11.640 position:56%
and then she shared what the story
I wrote and the interview that I did

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:17.320
with her director in Sweden,
and then they came to New Jersey

01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:21.200
to show their performance
at the Brunswick Theater.

01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:24.080
And we met after that.

01:02:24.080 --> 01:02:29.010
And then I was invited to
come, and they are very,

01:02:29.010 --> 01:02:30.840
very interested in working with us.

01:02:30.840 --> 01:02:35.590
We -- when we were in Sweden, we
met with the CEO of the [inaudible]

01:02:35.590 --> 01:02:40.750
who was embracing our efforts,
and they're looking forward

01:02:40.750 --> 01:02:45.850
to receiving our script
for the play and to expand

01:02:45.850 --> 01:02:47.970
with us our education program,

01:02:47.970 --> 01:02:52.150
and we're really excited
to be working with them.

01:02:52.150 --> 01:02:56.850
We met with the Kultur
attache at the Swedish Embassy

01:02:56.850 --> 01:02:59.710
who was very encouraging.

01:02:59.710 --> 01:03:03.510
So we're going to begin
those efforts very soon.

01:03:03.510 --> 01:03:07.070
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:07.070 --> 01:03:08.380
I brought -- yeah, yeah.

01:03:08.380 --> 01:03:09.680
Thanks for that.

01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:12.510
Yes. I brought it to them.

01:03:12.510 --> 01:03:17.980
[ Inaudible ]

01:03:17.980 --> 01:03:21.510
Thank you for asking
about how we get support.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.910
That's great.

01:03:25.910 --> 01:03:27.220
So we've gotten some grants.

01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:29.600
We got a grant from the
[inaudible] Conference that --

01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:32.780
and from private people to help us.

01:03:32.780 --> 01:03:36.450
We did a theater workshop
to explore the issue

01:03:36.450 --> 01:03:39.390
of connecting the Kulturbund
to current day.

01:03:39.390 --> 01:03:43.370
We've gotten a couple of other
grants and individuals give

01:03:43.370 --> 01:03:46.510
and we need to raise
a lot more money.

01:03:46.510 --> 01:03:51.680
So we are asking everyone to
give support or to let us know

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.660
of organizations that
would welcome this.

01:03:54.660 --> 01:03:58.950
I think we'll get some
things out of Sweden,

01:03:58.950 --> 01:04:04.570
and I think because it's
interdisciplinary there are a lot

01:04:04.570 --> 01:04:08.560
of different avenues that
we can go to get the support

01:04:08.560 --> 01:04:13.660
because I think this is a universal
story, and I think it will appeal

01:04:13.660 --> 01:04:15.510
to a lot of different groups.

01:04:15.510 --> 01:04:17.110
So thank you.

01:04:17.110 --> 01:04:18.740
&gt;&gt; Gail Shirazi: One last question.

01:04:18.740 --> 01:04:24.860
Well, I want to thank you
-- I want to thank Gail,

01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.610
and I want to thank Sarah
and Patrick for taking us

01:04:28.610 --> 01:04:33.070
on this cultural journey
through time, internationally

01:04:33.070 --> 01:04:35.250
and hopefully to the future.

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:39.130
So thank you, and I hope to see
you at other programs that we do.

01:04:39.130 --> 01:04:41.360
But this was a really
special program.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.560
Thank you very much.

01:04:43.560 --> 01:04:46.990

of the Library of Congress.
