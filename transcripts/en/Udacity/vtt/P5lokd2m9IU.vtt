00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:03.010
In this session,
we've gone from thinking about data and

00:00:03.010 --> 00:00:07.510
method separately, to thinking about
data and methods as packaged units.

00:00:07.510 --> 00:00:10.140
The concept of objects
representing packages of data and

00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:13.120
functionality is essential to
object oriented programming.

00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.379
And it will be a central
theme moving forward.

00:00:16.379 --> 00:00:17.450
See you in the next session.
