kind of have a little bit of firewood

00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:20.790
kind of have a little bit of firewood
 

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:22.400
kind of have a little bit of firewood
and I said sure here's your firewood and

00:03:22.400 --> 00:03:22.410
and I said sure here's your firewood and
 

00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:24.110
and I said sure here's your firewood and
this person said this time we're going

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:24.120
this person said this time we're going
 

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:25.100
this person said this time we're going
to try something different

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:25.110
to try something different
 

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:27.560
to try something different
here are some beads for you and I said I

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:27.570
here are some beads for you and I said I
 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.180
here are some beads for you and I said I
don't want beads I don't care for it

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:29.190
don't want beads I don't care for it
 

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:31.400
don't want beads I don't care for it
I'll need beads and said it's not about

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:31.410
I'll need beads and said it's not about
 

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.590
I'll need beads and said it's not about
that we're going to use beads as the

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:33.600
that we're going to use beads as the
 

00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:36.440
that we're going to use beads as the
objective ledger of our tribe instead of

objective ledger of our tribe instead of
 

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:38.449

rode the beads are going to keep track

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:40.380
rode the beads are going to keep track
 

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:42.590
rode the beads are going to keep track
for us an objective ledger to keep track

00:03:42.590 --> 00:03:42.600
for us an objective ledger to keep track
 

00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.509
for us an objective ledger to keep track
of debt and it was such a successful

00:03:44.509 --> 00:03:44.519
of debt and it was such a successful
 

00:03:44.519 --> 00:03:46.220

00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:48.050
technology that it took off and in a
couple thousand years it became

00:03:48.050 --> 00:03:48.060
couple thousand years it became
 

00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.400
couple thousand years it became
impossible to find a tribe or

this form of keeping track of debt with
 

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:02.870
this form of keeping track of debt with
an objective ledger took off and

an objective ledger took off and
 

00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:05.449
an objective ledger took off and
