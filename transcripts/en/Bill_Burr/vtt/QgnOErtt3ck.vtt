Put your pants on one leg at a time, Joe. Six pack going to work.

7
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.940
Um, I got to keep it down. This is new. This, this is the new, uh, more subdued,

8
00:00:23.941 --> 00:00:26.970
quieter podcasts. Now that I have a baby daughter,

9
00:00:29.070 --> 00:00:33.270

11
00:00:37.890 --> 00:00:40.350

12
00:00:41.430 --> 00:00:45.570
My fucking mixer is acting weird. What happens if I push this button? Anything?

13
00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.070
Anything? Oh, there you go.

14
00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.850
Just goes into one speaker and then the other one had fallen than the other.

15
00:00:50.851 --> 00:00:54.570
How are you? Did you enjoy your football Sunday? Did you Julius sports weekend.

16
00:00:55.080 --> 00:00:58.230
Did you follow politics? Did you watch college football?

17
00:00:59.950 --> 00:01:04.000
You just stare at the wall. Drinking boobs, ignoring your loved ones will,

18
00:01:04.001 --> 00:01:05.890
if you did, I'm jealous.

19
00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.360

21
00:01:15.021 --> 00:01:18.320
Tell me where did your Booz go? Charming. Billy.

22
00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:24.790
<v 1>It's sitting over there and every night a fucking steer but I can't have a</v>

23
00:01:25.791 --> 00:01:28.340
fucking drop because I got active work. Yes,

24
00:01:28.341 --> 00:01:31.550
I kid have a fucking drop cause I got acting work.

25
00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.230
See I'm slowly losing my mind. What if I just said one bill?

26
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:40.700
[inaudible] [inaudible] what if you just had one charming Billy?

27
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:46.360
Well then I drink the whole bottle and I taught computer on the couch and I be a

28
00:01:46.881 --> 00:01:49.430
fat fuck on camera and HD.

29
00:01:50.270 --> 00:01:55.160
I'm down to one 76 and change and he'd been working out because I was playing

30
00:01:55.161 --> 00:01:58.760
catch and fucked up my fucking calf. That's how old I am.

31
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:02.750
So I've just spent eating like an angel, you know,

32
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:07.370
after every bite I count and I chew fucking 27 times on each side of my mouth

33
00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:10.400
and then I take the Napkin and I wipe off like a fucking angel.

34
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.880
If there is a God, Allah,

35
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:19.620
whatever the fucking peanut butter sandwiches you read to or that are la peanut

36
00:02:19.621 --> 00:02:22.860
butter sandwiches. I wonder if fucking, uh,

37
00:02:23.100 --> 00:02:25.710
the couch getting any death threats from extreme Muslims?

38
00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:33.210
Well, maybe he was Muslim. I don't know.

39
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.840
They never really said God knows sesame street was liberal enough.

40
00:02:36.841 --> 00:02:39.780
They probably would have thrown that in back then. Right.

41
00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.110
And then Bob would be fucking singing that song. A, what is it?

42
00:02:45.111 --> 00:02:48.040
Who are the people in your neighborhood, in your name?

43
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:52.700
<v 2>[inaudible] Oh, who are the people in your neighborhood?</v>

44
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:56.130
The people that you meet each day. Oh, uh,

45
00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.340
<v 1>fucking puppet vampire. That app is be Muslim is in your neighborhood.</v>

46
00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:04.270
Just too long. That's what it was. Yeah, it's too fucking long. Um,

47
00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:08.650
you have an add, Devin, add a drop of booze in fucking 32 days.

48
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:12.310
32 fucking God damn days. I'll die right now. I'm not going gonna lie to you.

49
00:03:12.311 --> 00:03:16.210
This was the longest month in a day of the year. Without a doubt.

50
00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:22.270
Um, it's fun in the morning. It's not in the evening. Like right now.

51
00:03:22.271 --> 00:03:26.680
I just want to get fucking blasted, you know, I dunno.

52
00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:28.600
Can't do it though. Can't do it.

53
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:32.770
Gradually calm it down and got to get down to a buck 72 my fighting weight is

54
00:03:32.771 --> 00:03:36.910
Bob. Pogo says onF is for family season too. While you're watching,

55
00:03:37.030 --> 00:03:39.400
are you liking how you're giving it a thumbs up,

56
00:03:40.210 --> 00:03:44.230
whatever the fucking scoring system is over there at Netflix, you know,

57
00:03:44.231 --> 00:03:46.510
I don't know what they use and now they think they said they were gonna go with

58
00:03:46.511 --> 00:03:49.180
thumbs up, thumbs down. And I think they stuck with the star system.

59
00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:54.700
I have no idea. I don't pretend to know. Um,

60
00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.140
I whole fucking weekend, it's just been about keeping my fucking leg raised.

61
00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.560
I went to this fucking party on Thursday night with my lovely wife and the

62
00:04:04.930 --> 00:04:08.470
fucking host of it was given a big speech and I was stone sober and I had to go

63
00:04:08.471 --> 00:04:11.410
over and sit in the corner was outside in this guy's lawn with like a tent.

64
00:04:11.411 --> 00:04:12.970
Right. And I'm sitting,

65
00:04:12.971 --> 00:04:17.500
I go off in the corner to sit down and stone sober with a fucking,

66
00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.320
I had like club soda in line.

67
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:22.930
The hardest thing for me to order,

68
00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:27.460
cause I can never remember what you're saying. I could just for seminar,

69
00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.450
I can never remember club soda cause I never order it.

70
00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:32.560
And half the time I go up to the bartender of the bay, what can I get you?

71
00:04:32.561 --> 00:04:33.161
I'm like, yeah,

72
00:04:33.161 --> 00:04:37.150
what's that thing people drink when they don't drink and then they go club soda.

73
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:38.270
I go yes with a line.

74
00:04:41.410 --> 00:04:43.810
I'm not even trying to be funny like a third of the time.

75
00:04:43.811 --> 00:04:46.390
That's how I have to order it because I can't remember what it is cause I never

76
00:04:46.391 --> 00:04:47.224
ordered.

77
00:04:47.890 --> 00:04:52.890
So I'm on my second club soda and lime in this guy who's hosting the party.

78
00:04:54.071 --> 00:04:56.410
Fabulous whole these fucking tank and all these people.

79
00:04:56.411 --> 00:05:00.010
I had to go outside the tent cause I see a stone wall where I can sit down

80
00:05:00.011 --> 00:05:02.770
because my fucking ankle is filling up with fluid.

81
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.600
Um, and it's becoming twice the size of my other ankle. But you know,

82
00:05:08.601 --> 00:05:09.351
I went to the, you know,

83
00:05:09.351 --> 00:05:12.090
I just went into some walk in clinic and the guy looked at it going,

84
00:05:12.290 --> 00:05:14.660
I'll tell you what, I'll tell you. I can tell you what you did right now.

85
00:05:14.661 --> 00:05:18.090
I can tell you from across the fucking room without even doing an x ray,

86
00:05:18.091 --> 00:05:20.700
you know, walk in clinic type Shit, you know.

87
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:25.350
So I go to sit down the guys in the middle of this great speech,

88
00:05:25.360 --> 00:05:27.370
everybody's fucking listening and I don't know how,

89
00:05:27.371 --> 00:05:30.040
but I set my glass down and I reached back to get something.

90
00:05:30.041 --> 00:05:34.030
I knocked it off and it made that and it was like a fucking wineglass so it

91
00:05:34.031 --> 00:05:37.990
sounded like a booze glass in the middle of his speech and like half the tent

92
00:05:37.991 --> 00:05:42.310
fucking looks over at me. I spilled it on my leg, I did all of this stone sober.

93
00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:47.560
So my half comes walking out. She's laughing at me going, what did you do?

94
00:05:47.561 --> 00:05:49.770
And I was all embarrassed gone.

95
00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:53.410
I was going near stomach and a scene like I felt bad enough as it was.

96
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:56.380
And then she got mad at me cause I got like, I got, you know,

97
00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:59.720
I got emotional with her so she didn't,

98
00:05:59.721 --> 00:06:02.990
didn't talk to me for like two fucking days because of that two fucking days she

99
00:06:02.991 --> 00:06:05.150
started talking to me. You know what I mean?

100
00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:08.720
Like if she ever spilled a drink in herself and half a tent to people looked

101
00:06:08.721 --> 00:06:13.610
over at her and I walked over and said like, what did you do? You know,

102
00:06:13.611 --> 00:06:18.500
mad she'd be at me. But that's how it works in the male female dynamic.

103
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:19.383
All right.

104
00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:25.340
You're either wrong or you were too mean when you were right.

105
00:06:25.341 --> 00:06:27.740
That's basically how it was. That's what it was.

106
00:06:27.741 --> 00:06:31.760
I think I was guilty of being too mean. So anyways, I, um,

107
00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:35.210
I watched a little bit of the Patriots today. I saw the first quarter,

108
00:06:35.211 --> 00:06:37.670
I taped the game. I'm going to watch the rest of it. Uh,

109
00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:41.150
patriots with a little bit better today. Obviously it's early in the season,

110
00:06:41.810 --> 00:06:43.310
you know, this is what they always do.

111
00:06:43.311 --> 00:06:44.990
They hype up shit because people are winning.

112
00:06:45.230 --> 00:06:48.210
Beating teams are losing to teams and all this shit that you're not going to see

113
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:53.150
in January. Who gives a fuck, right. That's just getting going. And um,

114
00:06:53.750 --> 00:06:55.550
I actually went to a,

115
00:06:56.750 --> 00:07:01.670
I went to the stubhub Senate today and I saw the new Los Angeles charges their

116
00:07:01.671 --> 00:07:05.120
first game against the Miami Dolphins. Um,

117
00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:08.980
I went down there, I gotta tell you that might be the best stadium.

118
00:07:08.981 --> 00:07:13.270
I've seen a football game and at the NFL level simply because there was only

119
00:07:13.271 --> 00:07:14.920
25,000 people there.

120
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:18.850
I can't believe the patriots are playing the charges on the road.

121
00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:23.290
If I could see Tom Brady and a 25,000 seat stadium of that be fucking

122
00:07:23.291 --> 00:07:27.310
incredible. That's like old. That's like what the old NFL used to look like

123
00:07:29.170 --> 00:07:29.801
back before, you know,

124
00:07:29.801 --> 00:07:34.801
we out fucked all of those other stadiums back before lady Gaga and fuck it,

125
00:07:35.071 --> 00:07:38.380
Whitney Houston, everybody brought all these other people into the game.

126
00:07:39.430 --> 00:07:41.440
All these people who are just like, oh my God,

127
00:07:41.441 --> 00:07:43.390
what else happens after the concert? You know,

128
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:46.630
when they started watching football, so they had to build 50, 60, 70, 80,

129
00:07:46.631 --> 00:07:48.490
a hundred thousand fucking seat stadiums.

130
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:54.010
25,000 seat seats. I got to see two wily veterans,

131
00:07:54.640 --> 00:07:56.380
two gunslingers, Philip Rivers,

132
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:03.130
Philip Rivers against a, what's his face said? Jay Cutler's.

133
00:08:03.131 --> 00:08:05.710
A J a j. J color. That's right. Jay Cutler, right?

134
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.710
Am I gonna say his name right. Jade cutlet. I like it.

135
00:08:08.711 --> 00:08:12.400
One guy's a fucking religious frequent 90 kids. The other guys like set him up,

136
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:17.590
set him up. Let's have another drink, right? Jay Cutler. There you go.

137
00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:22.570
That's right. Jay Cutler. So I'm fucking San Diego had the God damn game one.

138
00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.930
Wait, this is, show me a bodybuilder. Is it Jake?

139
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:30.530
This is the age I'm at now. I don't know anybody's fucking name anymore.

140
00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:32.060
Jay Cutler. There we go.

141
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.333
<v 3>Or are we?</v>

142
00:08:36.790 --> 00:08:40.360
<v 1>No, it is Jay Cutler. All right. Whatever the fuck this fucking guy, right?</v>

143
00:08:40.361 --> 00:08:42.610
He key key leads his team down the field.

144
00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.180
They go ahead by three points and then San Diego comes down the field.

145
00:08:46.490 --> 00:08:47.800
Philip prevalence, he doesn't give a shit.

146
00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.280
You think he's worried about a fucking two minute offense.

147
00:08:51.281 --> 00:08:56.250
This guy's got nine miles to feet. Did you bet you have a nine kids?

148
00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:01.230
Just ski. Just come home to a standing ovation. Everybody's freaking as here.

149
00:09:01.290 --> 00:09:04.800
You have a crowd, you have a fucking crowd of kids. Oh, amazing.

150
00:09:04.801 --> 00:09:09.600
Is that til they all become teenagers and then there's a 10 to 15 year period

151
00:09:09.601 --> 00:09:13.900
where they hated you. You know, you never made sure that I know.

152
00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:17.710
So got staked out. You always sat down on the other end of the table.

153
00:09:17.711 --> 00:09:21.520
They wanted to sit closer to you and he's going to deal with all of that shit.

154
00:09:21.521 --> 00:09:26.200
Right. Um, was it great game, fantastic fucking stadium.

155
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:28.310
<v 4>MMM [inaudible]</v>

156
00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.690
<v 1>yeah. Greatness is not a bad seat in the house.</v>

157
00:09:30.691 --> 00:09:34.830
I'm telling you before they moved to some giant monstrosity of a fucking stadium

158
00:09:34.831 --> 00:09:38.910
that this sharing with the rams, I believe. And it's going to fucking, you know,

159
00:09:38.911 --> 00:09:40.050
bankrupt the city.

160
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.450
<v 4>Um hmm.</v>

161
00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.910
<v 1>Before they fucking do that. [inaudible] if you get a chance,</v>

162
00:09:44.911 --> 00:09:47.970
definitely go to this stuff up center. It's fucking phenomenal. You know,

163
00:09:48.070 --> 00:09:48.830
it's funny, I was, I was sitting,

164
00:09:48.830 --> 00:09:51.870
I was watching the game and I see this guy flying over in this helicopter in the

165
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:55.570
Robinson 44 during a fucking game. He's,

166
00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.950
he looks like he's not even 500 feet off the fucking Griff flies right over the

167
00:09:58.951 --> 00:10:02.250
fucking stadium. And I, with my limited knowledge of aviation,

168
00:10:02.730 --> 00:10:05.670
realized that when there's this big event like that, it's an automatic,

169
00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:09.780
a temporary no fly zone, an hour before and an hour and after the game,

170
00:10:09.781 --> 00:10:12.990
I believe that what is if not two hours before and after, right?

171
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.050
This fucking jerk off flies right over the fucking stadium.

172
00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:19.380
I'm sitting there with my buddy going, ah, that didn't look like a cop. Right?

173
00:10:19.381 --> 00:10:22.500
You can't, I don't think you can fucking do that. I'm just a novice,

174
00:10:22.501 --> 00:10:25.650
but I do not think you could do that. This fucking jerk off comes by again.

175
00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:30.120
He's on his side showing all the passengers down in it and then like two seconds

176
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:32.280
later, like a police helicopter comes flying over.

177
00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.420
I don't know if he got in trouble or what, but uh, I dunno.

178
00:10:38.430 --> 00:10:40.380
I know some pilots listen to this shit. I, like I said,

179
00:10:40.381 --> 00:10:42.540
I don't ever pretend to know anything about that stuff.

180
00:10:43.200 --> 00:10:46.560
As far as my limited knowledge. You are not allowed to do that.

181
00:10:47.490 --> 00:10:51.600
God forbid something happens and then you fucking land on 25,000 people watching

182
00:10:51.601 --> 00:10:54.660
fucking Jay Cutler, right?

183
00:10:54.661 --> 00:10:57.520
With keg booze coming out of his pores going up against, uh,

184
00:10:57.550 --> 00:11:02.200
the other guy from Ash Wednesday, right? Um, uh,

185
00:11:02.220 --> 00:11:06.010
these Kansas city chiefs for real. Uh, so I,

186
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.340
I fucking got a taxi on the way down.

187
00:11:10.120 --> 00:11:10.953
<v 4>Um,</v>

188
00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:15.180
<v 1>and then on the way back I called the car service and I'm fucking telling this</v>

189
00:11:15.181 --> 00:11:19.110
guy, I'm like, meet me at one 84 and Avalon. All right,

190
00:11:19.111 --> 00:11:21.780
there's a Kentucky Fried Chicken right next to a donut place.

191
00:11:21.781 --> 00:11:25.390
Can you fucking meet me there? Right? So the guy is like, yeah, that good?

192
00:11:26.710 --> 00:11:30.600
All right, great. Great. All right, so we get down there, right? The game ends.

193
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:34.260
I walk out there for 15, he's supposed to pick me up at four 30.

194
00:11:34.261 --> 00:11:37.890
I call the guy up, he's like a fucking city block away. Everything's going good.

195
00:11:38.310 --> 00:11:40.710
Then all of a sudden the cops are everything and they're like dead. Like

196
00:11:42.750 --> 00:11:46.710
Uber and Lyft, one 92 guac down that walked down to one 92. Right?

197
00:11:46.711 --> 00:11:49.590
And I'm sitting there going, well, I'm not Uber or Lyft car service. I'm like,

198
00:11:49.591 --> 00:11:51.810
these guys are going to fuck with me. So I try and call this guy.

199
00:11:51.810 --> 00:11:56.230
I call the guy up and I keep telling the guy, he's gone, okay,

200
00:11:56.231 --> 00:11:59.040
I am a block away. I'm a block away and I'm going, yes. Yeah.

201
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:03.560
I forget the Kentucky the care of. See, I'm going, no, no, no, no, no dokie.

202
00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:07.350
I've Siena. Okay, IFC. There's a donut shop right next door.

203
00:12:07.530 --> 00:12:11.130
I'm going to walk over, see if you can turn in there, and he goes, Oh God, God,

204
00:12:11.131 --> 00:12:15.900
KFC. I'm going, no, no. Listen. I'm walking over and walking over.

205
00:12:16.410 --> 00:12:18.480
I forget he can't walk into the Donald Place.

206
00:12:18.481 --> 00:12:21.570
I'm going to go down to one 92 and Avalon. He goes, okay,

207
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:23.940
they're parking lot KFC.

208
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:28.240
He just kept saying that like a prank show and I'm literally getting angry,

209
00:12:29.350 --> 00:12:34.180
yelling. No. One 92 an Avalon into my phone. I'm like,

210
00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:35.620
people with kids had turned around and looking at me,

211
00:12:35.621 --> 00:12:38.950
so I'm trying to put more of a happier tone in my voice and it's just not

212
00:12:38.951 --> 00:12:43.560
working and he just kept going. Okay. A KFC parking lot. I come, no,

213
00:12:43.561 --> 00:12:47.360
one 92 an Avalon. And then I finally go, dude, just repeat it, repeat it.

214
00:12:47.440 --> 00:12:51.630
And he goes, yes, yes. I go, repeat what I said. He goes, one 92 Avalon. I go,

215
00:12:51.631 --> 00:12:53.940
fine, fine. And then like he's calling me back,

216
00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:56.820
pulling into the donut shop and I'm going,

217
00:12:58.670 --> 00:13:03.410
I finally had to fucking take a picture of one 92 on Avalon and send it to the

218
00:13:03.411 --> 00:13:06.110
fucking guy they showed up, right? And he was the greatest guy ever.

219
00:13:07.010 --> 00:13:08.780
Greatest guy ever. And I was like, all right. You know what?

220
00:13:08.930 --> 00:13:11.630
Maybe I got a little emotional. Okay,

221
00:13:11.631 --> 00:13:14.720
there's 25,000 people walking up and down the Goddamn street here.

222
00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.220
I don't know what to do here. Maybe, you know, I don't know what,

223
00:13:18.230 --> 00:13:22.700
but I will tell you, when I was at the game, um, GFSI,

224
00:13:23.150 --> 00:13:26.840
when I was at the game, the, uh, these people in front of me,

225
00:13:26.841 --> 00:13:28.970
I've never seen this before. We're drinking a,

226
00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.160
what's that Mexican beer that begins with a,

227
00:13:31.610 --> 00:13:35.360
with an m begins with an M bay. It's in a,

228
00:13:35.361 --> 00:13:38.900
it's fucking gold, right? It looks like this looks like a trophy.

229
00:13:39.780 --> 00:13:42.410
It looks delicious, especially after 32 days and not booze.

230
00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:45.050
And so these people in front of me are drinking this shit in and out of a can

231
00:13:45.410 --> 00:13:48.980
and they had this shit, this shit on top. I'm like, what the fuck is that?

232
00:13:51.290 --> 00:13:54.200
Does that crushed red pepper flakes? What is, and this guy next to me, he goes,

233
00:13:54.220 --> 00:13:57.240
Chili powder, they put chili powder around the top because I don't like it.

234
00:13:57.810 --> 00:14:02.100
I'm like, is that like white people put an alignment of fucking corona, I guess?

235
00:14:02.101 --> 00:14:04.020
Yeah, it's something like that. He goes, you know, I don't really like it.

236
00:14:04.021 --> 00:14:08.730
And I was like, well, I gotta try that. I mean, not right now,

237
00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:12.500
but eventually I'm going to try that. Um,

238
00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:14.670
it looked like the shit that you put on, you know,

239
00:14:14.671 --> 00:14:17.640
that are the warning tracks are these new, uh, baseball stadiums.

240
00:14:17.780 --> 00:14:19.320
It's sort of sand and sort of rubber.

241
00:14:19.321 --> 00:14:22.470
That's what it looked like from fucking far away. Um,

242
00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:26.430
so that guy proceeds to get absolutely plastered and after three fucking,

243
00:14:28.380 --> 00:14:29.850
um, quarters,

244
00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:35.240
he comes back up and yells to the crowd that they stopped serving beer at the

245
00:14:35.761 --> 00:14:40.590
start of the fourth quarter and he's yelling about how dumb it is. And, uh,

246
00:14:40.591 --> 00:14:43.470
that's one of those moments where as good that I also wasn't drunk cause I

247
00:14:43.471 --> 00:14:44.370
would've been like, yeah buddy,

248
00:14:44.371 --> 00:14:47.970
you're the reason you're the fucking reason they do that because you can't hold

249
00:14:47.971 --> 00:14:49.920
your alcohol. Look at you. You're a fucking mess.

250
00:14:50.610 --> 00:14:53.750
So actually went to this game and this is like a record for me.

251
00:14:53.751 --> 00:14:56.300
I didn't have any booze and I didn't eat any of the shit food.

252
00:14:56.301 --> 00:14:59.360
I had like two handfuls of fucking peanuts and drank like three waters.

253
00:15:00.110 --> 00:15:00.943
That's it.

254
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:02.380
<v 3>Okay.</v>

255
00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:05.050
<v 1>Because I can't be a fat fuck in this thing, you know, so, um,</v>

256
00:15:06.830 --> 00:15:08.820
I fucking go downstairs and take a Piss, right? Yeah.

257
00:15:10.530 --> 00:15:14.370
And he's this fucking guy just yelling at the police and there's like two cops

258
00:15:14.371 --> 00:15:17.250
there and then there's three, and then there's five. And I'm walking by.

259
00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:23.350
I go down and take a piss and I come back and there is like half the police

260
00:15:23.491 --> 00:15:27.300
force is standing there and is this white dude screaming at all of these cops

261
00:15:28.590 --> 00:15:29.131
screaming,

262
00:15:29.131 --> 00:15:32.610
you gotta do some go up there and do some none other white guys yell at Dude.

263
00:15:32.611 --> 00:15:35.400
It was like total white guy moment like yelling at fucking 20 cops.

264
00:15:35.460 --> 00:15:39.170
He's not getting the shit kicked out of them. And they actually listened to it,

265
00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:41.010
went up, they'd kicked two guys out.

266
00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:45.090
The other guys were like really fucking like, all right. They just sort of left.

267
00:15:45.091 --> 00:15:49.670
I don't know what they did. I Dunno what the fuck they did.

268
00:15:50.030 --> 00:15:52.430
It was the weirdest thing was the two guys screaming,

269
00:15:52.431 --> 00:15:56.510
looking like the ones that were going to get fucking arrested. Um,

270
00:15:57.850 --> 00:16:00.550
but we're demanding that these cops go up and do something.

271
00:16:00.551 --> 00:16:03.850
And then they finally fucking did and they threw these guys up.

272
00:16:03.851 --> 00:16:05.830
It's really bizarre day, but I'm, but once again,

273
00:16:06.810 --> 00:16:11.260
a phenomenal fucking a sports experience if you go there. So, um,

274
00:16:12.400 --> 00:16:14.950
I apologize. A lot of this shit is going to be all sports stuff.

275
00:16:14.951 --> 00:16:16.240
That's kind of what I did this weekend.

276
00:16:16.241 --> 00:16:19.570
I kind of hung out with the daughter and I just watched a bunch of sports and

277
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:20.793
uh,

278
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.960
did anybody put it on the NFL network and watch Dan Marino of football life.

279
00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:29.000
It was fucking amazing.

280
00:16:29.001 --> 00:16:34.001
But like you can't do the Dan Marino story in fucking 30 minutes.

281
00:16:34.401 --> 00:16:38.350
That should have been an hour and a half long at least. And as much as he fine,

282
00:16:38.351 --> 00:16:42.740
I feel like the finally got his fucking do as you're watching Troy Aikman pate

283
00:16:42.741 --> 00:16:45.260
manning, Brett Farve, all of them saying this was the guy,

284
00:16:45.290 --> 00:16:46.760
this was the fucking guy.

285
00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:52.190
Then finally putting to bed this whole thing that you know that because he

286
00:16:52.191 --> 00:16:53.150
didn't want a Superbowl,

287
00:16:53.151 --> 00:16:57.800
like that's some sort of like black mark up against the guy's fucking name,

288
00:16:57.830 --> 00:17:00.890
the guy, he was so ahead of his time,

289
00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:05.030
he was such an unbelievable fucking quarterback. It took 25 years,

290
00:17:05.031 --> 00:17:06.530
a quarter of a century.

291
00:17:06.770 --> 00:17:11.770
Any massive change in the rules of passing and how you could defend against the

292
00:17:12.771 --> 00:17:17.771
past for people to start fucking with what this guy did from 1983 on.

293
00:17:19.730 --> 00:17:20.720
Um, he was unbelievable.

294
00:17:20.870 --> 00:17:24.700
You know what kills me is his dad taught him how to throw ball, come,

295
00:17:24.710 --> 00:17:26.750
the arm comes up, ball comes out.

296
00:17:27.470 --> 00:17:30.710
And I can't even tell you how many times as a patriots family played him twice a

297
00:17:30.711 --> 00:17:35.120
fucking year. I thought Andre tip had had him, he's armed with the football,

298
00:17:35.121 --> 00:17:38.280
would still be at his waist and Andre was bringing his fucking arm down to get

299
00:17:38.390 --> 00:17:43.070
them and somehow his armored come up and it'd be out 40 odd fucking laser.

300
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:46.330
Oh my God. He used to kill us.

301
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:48.550
He used to kill for all you young dolphin fans out there.

302
00:17:48.551 --> 00:17:51.900
That fucking Tom Brady. You know,

303
00:17:52.290 --> 00:17:55.020
cause he's been beating your ass two games a year for like almost his whole

304
00:17:55.021 --> 00:18:00.000
career. Just about, um, that's payback for Dan Marino.

305
00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:04.733
I'm telling you,

306
00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:09.930
Dan Marino today in his prime would easily throw for over 6,000 yards easily.

307
00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:15.190
And if you could actually win without having a running game,

308
00:18:15.191 --> 00:18:17.860
which you can nowadays, the way they fucking game has changed,

309
00:18:18.070 --> 00:18:22.140
he would have at least one Superbowl ring. Okay. I'm telling you, um,

310
00:18:22.240 --> 00:18:26.080
one of my favorites of fucking all time and I'm glad they finally did, uh,

311
00:18:26.410 --> 00:18:30.820
the football life and I think it was at least an hour too short. All right,

312
00:18:30.821 --> 00:18:34.030
there you go. I've said my piece that's coming from a patriots fan too.

313
00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.130
And when he played, I fucking hated him because he killed us.

314
00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:42.610
I didn't really hate him, but you know what I mean? I wasn't pleased with him.

315
00:18:43.750 --> 00:18:45.460
All right, let me do the little bit of the, uh,

316
00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.280
something has to break up this sport. Stop guys. I gotta,

317

319
00:18:56.590 --> 00:18:58.630

00:25:45.710 --> 00:25:47.840
I want to start a new thing to write in. Okay?

438
00:25:47.841 --> 00:25:52.100
So this podcast doesn't get any more stale than it already is. Um,

439
00:25:53.150 --> 00:25:58.150
is your favorite performances by non stars in movies where you and your friends

440
00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:00.740
still quoted?

441
00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:04.880
It's an unknown fucking actor and you may never even saw him again.

442
00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.960
Never even seen the person again. I'm so me. I'm going to kick it off.

443
00:26:09.170 --> 00:26:11.270
I don't even know this actress names. Let me look this up.

444
00:26:11.271 --> 00:26:16.271
He was in resonances of war dogs cop.

445
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:18.573
<v 3>Okay</v>

446
00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.830
<v 1>actor. Let's see if I could find the name of this guy. Um,</v>

447
00:26:24.510 --> 00:26:27.300
I don't know what this fucking guy's name is. I got to give him a shout out.

448
00:26:27.301 --> 00:26:29.940
You know, I'm going to hit pause because I want to give this guys shout up.

449
00:26:32.100 --> 00:26:37.030
Okay. Unknown on hail or did unheralded actor. Um,

450
00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:41.460
as far as I know, rich Turner in reservoir dogs.

451
00:26:42.610 --> 00:26:47.470
It's one of my fucking, just one scene actors. I've, I've,

452
00:26:47.640 --> 00:26:50.960
I don't know, I don't watch a ton of movies, but I fucking love this guy.

453
00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:55.490
He plays the cop in the bathroom when, uh, what's his face?

454
00:26:55.491 --> 00:26:58.990
Tim Roth is sitting there with all the drugs and he comes out and this is a dog,

455
00:26:59.230 --> 00:27:03.740
a dog sniff and a the drug sniff dog sniffing drug sniffing dog.

456
00:27:05.270 --> 00:27:08.930
Um, so he was in pulp fiction too,

457
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:14.690
meaning also, yeah, he wasn't in a lot of movies, but he plays the way he,

458
00:27:14.870 --> 00:27:17.060
he's being the cop and he's telling that story.

459
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.920
Just the way he like the line. I said, buddy,

460
00:27:21.921 --> 00:27:24.680
I'm going to shoot you in the face if you don't put your fucking hands on that

461
00:27:24.681 --> 00:27:28.220
dashboard. That's just the way it's written and the way he did it. He goes,

462
00:27:28.221 --> 00:27:29.090
I said, buddy,

463
00:27:30.230 --> 00:27:35.060
I am going to shoot you in the face if you don't put your fucking hands on that

464
00:27:35.061 --> 00:27:36.860
dashboard. Just the way he said it.

465
00:27:37.130 --> 00:27:40.460
I don't know why that sounds exactly like a fucking cop to me.

466
00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:43.730
So that was like something just me and my friends,

467
00:27:43.731 --> 00:27:47.840
we would be fucking hammered striking out with chicks and you'd just be walking

468
00:27:47.841 --> 00:27:50.870
out to your car and one of your invariably would just go, buddy,

469
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.170
I am going to shoot you in the face. And everyone just started laughing.

470
00:27:55.171 --> 00:27:58.850
You don't put your fucking hands in that dashboard. Who are your favorites?

471
00:28:00.170 --> 00:28:03.800
Who are your favorites? They just had that one thing. You fucking friends.

472
00:28:03.801 --> 00:28:06.200
You still quoted, man. I just knew a bunch of those.

473
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.630
There's obviously a zillion guys.

474
00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.550
There's a zillion lines and fucking Po, uh, in um,

475
00:28:14.090 --> 00:28:18.380
Goodfellas by the way. Uh, rest in peace. Frank Vinson,

476
00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:23.470
the first big guy to go from Goodfellows man. I mean, what a,

477
00:28:23.471 --> 00:28:27.170
what an absolute legend. What an absolute legend.

478
00:28:28.190 --> 00:28:31.040
He was as amazing as an actor, as his hair was.

479
00:28:31.430 --> 00:28:36.290
What a head of hair that guy had. Good Lord Jesus Christ.

480
00:28:36.291 --> 00:28:38.870
What a head of hair. That guy had his whole frigging life.

481
00:28:39.680 --> 00:28:42.110
That's what you say when you're bald. You fucking see that on people.

482
00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:46.510
Look at that guy. I Dunno if I ever had that hair.

483
00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:53.690
Some people, you know, some people they just fucking,

484
00:28:53.691 --> 00:28:55.880
I don't know what genes that guy is, that guy,

485
00:28:55.881 --> 00:29:00.350
he must had a Roman emperor or something in his fucking family tree,

486
00:29:01.010 --> 00:29:05.550
credible actor. And so God damn funny,

487
00:29:05.580 --> 00:29:08.790
comedic timing was incredible. Um,

488
00:29:10.170 --> 00:29:13.590
I even loved that commercial. He did one, I think his only line was, oh,

489
00:29:13.720 --> 00:29:16.600
when that guy was like stocking up the freezer and he was disrespected them and

490
00:29:16.620 --> 00:29:18.660
his buddy just kept going, oh,

491
00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:22.310
I'm definitely going to miss him.

492
00:29:22.311 --> 00:29:26.770
And that was definitely somebody on my bucket list. You know, I get in a movie,

493
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:27.980
I have like fucking two or three lines,

494
00:29:27.981 --> 00:29:31.850
but that was definitely a bucket list to ever be able to do a scene with him.

495
00:29:32.090 --> 00:29:36.590
And what was so cool? Uh, Michael Rappaport, um,

496
00:29:36.710 --> 00:29:39.770
quite possibly the funniest guy in social media right now with this fucking

497
00:29:39.771 --> 00:29:42.730
videos. I was so goddamn funny. Um,

498
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:47.620
he actually posted a picture on his Twitter account. You should check it out.

499
00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:48.821
I think it's,

500
00:29:48.821 --> 00:29:53.821
I am at ILM Rappaport and it's him working with Frank Vinson in the early

501
00:29:54.250 --> 00:29:55.083
nineties.

502
00:29:55.450 --> 00:29:59.740
It was like really early on and he got a picture of him shine and Frank Vincent

503
00:29:59.741 --> 00:30:03.760
shoes. And he said, uh, at one time, Frank Vincent,

504
00:30:05.050 --> 00:30:06.970
uh, maybe go home and get my shine box.

505
00:30:06.971 --> 00:30:10.960
And what I love was a lot of people now can look back on it as a classic,

506
00:30:10.961 --> 00:30:13.990
and everybody's quoted at a zillion times, but Rappaport I already knew.

507
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:17.320
Go home and get your fucking shine bucks. He was on that shit early.

508
00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:22.360
Fucking early nineties. Uh, they barely done editing it.

509
00:30:22.361 --> 00:30:24.880
He already knew that that was an instant fucking classic. Uh,

510
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.640
I've gotta get him back on the podcast again. He has so many amazing stories.

511
00:30:28.180 --> 00:30:32.800
Um, anyways, uh, let's skip that. Let me finish this fight.

512
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.970
I had to break up the, uh, podcast reading, I mean, the, uh,

513
00:30:36.050 --> 00:30:39.310
advertising reading. Why do I say the wrong thing first before I correct it?

514
00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.420
I Dunno bill. Cause you're dumb because you have a zillion things on your mind.

515
00:30:43.421 --> 00:30:47.110
I know. Fair enough. All right. Dollar Shave club, everybody.

516
00:30:47.990 --> 00:30:51.580
What you might not know, there's a lot of things you do know,

517
00:30:51.581 --> 00:30:54.430
but what you might not know, I said Buddy,

518
00:30:55.000 --> 00:30:59.770
is that dollar shave club also also has products for pretty much everything else

519
00:30:59.771 --> 00:31:04.120
you need in the bathroom. Body Wash, shampoo, Hair Gel,

520
00:31:04.121 --> 00:31:08.260
don't need any of that. Lip Balm, everything. What am I going to Moose,

521
00:31:08.261 --> 00:31:10.240
my pubes uh, at the store.

522
00:31:10.241 --> 00:31:13.420
There are too many options and you can't tell the difference between any of

523
00:31:13.421 --> 00:31:15.370
them. Then if you have any questions,

524
00:31:15.371 --> 00:31:18.790
that clerk usually doesn't know the difference or it's still running the fucking

525
00:31:18.791 --> 00:31:21.810
cash register. They can't help you anyways. All right,

526

527

530
00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:40.480
I would never invest in a fucking strip mall. I swear to God,

531
00:31:40.780 --> 00:31:43.480

589
00:34:59.970 --> 00:35:02.520
Formula One. Did you think I wasn't gonna talk about Formula One.

590
00:35:02.730 --> 00:35:04.560
What'd you think I was gonna talk about how Mississippi,

591
00:35:04.620 --> 00:35:07.380
Mississippi State fucking trans my LSU Tigers.

592
00:35:08.670 --> 00:35:10.140
You know another one of my favorite teams,

593
00:35:10.141 --> 00:35:14.190
SMU given away 56 pounds per player on the fucking offensive and defense

594
00:35:14.191 --> 00:35:16.620
offensive line against TCU. C'Mon frogs.

595
00:35:17.430 --> 00:35:21.900
How SMU was whipping that fucking horn tone ass for fucking the first half

596
00:35:21.901 --> 00:35:24.300
before they wore him down. He just leaned on him.

597
00:35:26.300 --> 00:35:26.970
<v 5>Um,</v>

598
00:35:26.970 --> 00:35:29.940
<v 1>do you think I was going to congratulate the Cleveland Indians in an unprecedent</v>

599
00:35:29.941 --> 00:35:31.950
22 in a row? Does that what you thought I was going to do?

600
00:35:33.580 --> 00:35:36.010
You think I was gonna do all of that and I was going to talk about that Formula

601
00:35:36.011 --> 00:35:41.011
One race down in fucking that race made me sick to one of my favorite races of

602
00:35:43.261 --> 00:35:46.290
the year. It's at night. It's in Singapore. It's one of the most beautiful,

603
00:35:46.291 --> 00:35:49.740
amazing slash kind of freak me out cities I've ever been to in my life slash

604
00:35:49.741 --> 00:35:54.050
countries. Um, it really is one of the most beautiful,

605
00:35:54.250 --> 00:35:58.610
like amazing fucking city where you just feel like you're overbearing.

606
00:35:58.611 --> 00:36:01.640
Parents are home all the time. Um,

607
00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:07.540
it was fucking rain. It was night. It was raining out. Okay.

608
00:36:07.541 --> 00:36:10.870
The Ferrari's were running great. Daniel Ricardo was running great.

609
00:36:11.050 --> 00:36:14.500
Mercedes wasn't doing that well, you know,

610
00:36:14.590 --> 00:36:17.440
I don't know if Hamilton had a fucking, I thought it was all tied up.

611
00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.600
Maybe he was up by three points. I can't remember.

612
00:36:20.940 --> 00:36:25.370
The Ferrari needed to show up on this fucking day. Alright.

613
00:36:25.580 --> 00:36:29.220
And if you watched when they were doing the time trials on Saturday and you sell

614
00:36:29.330 --> 00:36:33.590
what it's like trying to drive behind somebody doing 0050607080 fucking miles an

615
00:36:33.591 --> 00:36:37.100
hour with that fucking rooster tail of water coming up.

616
00:36:37.101 --> 00:36:40.610
I mean it was going to be an unbelievable fucking race.

617
00:36:42.330 --> 00:36:45.690
God knows whoever's in fucking first place and then first turn is going to win

618
00:36:45.691 --> 00:36:48.640
the Goddamn race. Alright,

619
00:36:48.910 --> 00:36:53.710
so Sebastian Vettel the Ferrari's they get first and third.

620
00:36:55.370 --> 00:36:58.580
Alright, with Daniel Ricardo, the red bull is in second fucking place.

621
00:36:58.850 --> 00:37:02.150
I believe that's the way it was, right? Fucking Mercedes,

622
00:37:02.151 --> 00:37:06.780
a back and forth and fifth. So the Goddamn race starts

623
00:37:08.410 --> 00:37:09.700
offer our, he has to do,

624
00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.900
all he's got to do is just make it to the first turn and first fucking place

625
00:37:13.930 --> 00:37:18.700
unscathed. He's going to win this fucking race. Okay? Worst case scenario,

626
00:37:18.701 --> 00:37:22.390
Hamilton gets fucking second place. That's only 18 points.

627
00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.710
Federal is going to get 25 he'll pick up fucking, you know, whatever.

628
00:37:26.711 --> 00:37:30.160
What is that seven points? The fucking race starts

629
00:37:31.990 --> 00:37:34.800
Kimmy Reagan, and he acted like fucking Greg Brady when, when he,

630
00:37:34.810 --> 00:37:36.220
when the pressure was on to beat him,

631
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:38.130
gotta beat Marcia gotta get close to that quarter of an inch.

632
00:37:38.230 --> 00:37:43.210
He fucking stomps on the guests, tries to go around. Oh, I'm sorry.

633
00:37:43.211 --> 00:37:44.410
It was Max for stappen.

634
00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:49.300
Not Daniel Ricard tries to go around the guy that fucking tires get all fucking

635
00:37:50.920 --> 00:37:53.620
in a locked there and they fucking go up and over.

636
00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:58.680
He fucking fucks up his car,

637
00:38:00.670 --> 00:38:04.570
slams the fucking red bull car into his fucking teammate.

638
00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:10.770
The other Ferrari Vettel makes it to the first turn unscathed.

639
00:38:11.730 --> 00:38:15.060
Meanwhile, fucking not on skate, but he makes it there,

640
00:38:15.090 --> 00:38:18.420
but it's his car's fucked up and got hit in the back. Meanwhile,

641
00:38:18.421 --> 00:38:22.750
fucking lose fucking Hamilton. He drives right around this shit rays.

642
00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:27.720
He sneaking by fuck head comes back in with this fucked up car. Greg Brady,

643
00:38:27.750 --> 00:38:32.280
right smashes in to the fucking red bull guy again.

644
00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:37.150
And who does he hit? He hits the fucking Alfonso in the fucking orange car.

645
00:38:37.430 --> 00:38:39.280
Try and do the exact same thing as Lewis Hamilton,

646
00:38:39.281 --> 00:38:42.850
but Lewis Hamilton's the Derek Jeter fucking star child,

647
00:38:42.851 --> 00:38:46.570
just blessed 3000 hit the eight a fucking grand slam one of these guys

648
00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.670
and fucking Vettel drives like, you know,

649
00:38:49.671 --> 00:38:52.760
two more turns in the whole front of his car, comes off both Ferrari's,

650
00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:56.360
out of the fucking race. They were in first and third place at first and fourth.

651
00:38:56.361 --> 00:38:57.440
I can't like, I don't remember.

652
00:38:58.750 --> 00:38:59.583
<v 5>They had them,</v>

653
00:39:01.360 --> 00:39:03.280
<v 1>they had them and they let off the hook.</v>

654
00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.080
They were both out of the race before it even fucking started.

655
00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:12.700
And all I could think is what my dad used to always say when somebody would do

656
00:39:12.701 --> 00:39:16.210
something like that, you'd be on crisis guy. Like that guy I that guy,

657
00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.560
you could fuck up a free lunch.

658
00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.070
That's the first expression that popped in my head at that.

659
00:39:20.071 --> 00:39:22.000
I think I tweeted it. I was so fucking pissed.

660
00:39:22.750 --> 00:39:25.660
Ferrari could fuck up a free lunch. I mean that was a free lunch.

661
00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:28.290
No one could drive fast at day.

662
00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:31.330
Mercedes weren't running well the whole fucking weekend. So what do you do?

663
00:39:34.070 --> 00:39:38.240
You take out yourself and you fucking teammate you clear out the whole fucking

664
00:39:38.241 --> 00:39:39.170
front row

665
00:39:41.810 --> 00:39:45.470
for fucking Lewis Hamilton who just drives along unscathed.

666
00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.860
That Guy Louis Hamilton is a blessed man.

667
00:39:49.940 --> 00:39:51.410
That's one of those deals. He's one of those guys.

668
00:39:51.411 --> 00:39:53.090
Makes you believe in a higher power like this.

669
00:39:53.091 --> 00:39:54.940
Just somebody that just fucking loves. I mean,

670
00:39:54.941 --> 00:39:57.390
I know I'm taking away all the preparation that man does, but

671
00:39:59.070 --> 00:39:59.903
<v 5>you know,</v>

672
00:40:00.840 --> 00:40:04.320
<v 1>he cuts around the outside, no problem. Alphonso goes through the same thing.</v>

673
00:40:04.470 --> 00:40:06.540
His fucking day's over. Unbelievable.

674
00:40:06.541 --> 00:40:10.500
And then the rest of the race and riding around the fucking rain and Hamilton

675
00:40:10.501 --> 00:40:14.810
fucking winds. No problem. Unfucking believable.

676
00:40:16.310 --> 00:40:19.880
They, I wanted to see a race. I knew that Hamilton was going to try to fucking,

677
00:40:20.450 --> 00:40:23.240
he wasn't going to be happy sitting in, you know, all the way back there. Right.

678
00:40:23.480 --> 00:40:24.470
Who would be right.

679
00:40:24.650 --> 00:40:27.770
I wanted to see what the fuck he was going to do with this car.

680
00:40:27.771 --> 00:40:31.670
Not doing that well and all of that rain. What'd he actually crash? I mean,

681
00:40:31.671 --> 00:40:33.620
you know, he's going to drip, push it to the fucking limit.

682
00:40:33.650 --> 00:40:36.050
All of that was out of the second.

683
00:40:36.051 --> 00:40:40.070
It started like remember that year that jets was supposed to be good in like

684
00:40:40.071 --> 00:40:45.071
fucking 99 and like the first game Vinny tested verde goes back and blows out as

685
00:40:46.151 --> 00:40:49.250
Achilles and then key Sean was crying after the game.

686
00:40:50.450 --> 00:40:53.720
That was the original. That's my quarterback. That was the original.

687
00:40:55.570 --> 00:40:56.403
<v 5>Um,</v>

688
00:40:58.670 --> 00:41:01.970
<v 1>that's what it was like. I still watched the fucking race. It was still fucking,</v>

689
00:41:03.290 --> 00:41:07.880
it was still exciting by Jesus Christ. Um, anyways,

690
00:41:09.050 --> 00:41:10.730
and then I also, I watched the boxing.

691
00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:14.030
That's all I do this weekend is I just fucking watched a brain in an episode.

692
00:41:14.031 --> 00:41:14.781
F is for family.

693
00:41:14.781 --> 00:41:17.000
So I just stayed in the whole fucking weekend when I wasn't riding.

694
00:41:17.001 --> 00:41:19.700
I was just watching sports and uh,

695
00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:24.650
I'm not a big box and guy just because I've gotten fucked over so many times in

696
00:41:24.651 --> 00:41:28.850
the paper views. Uh, so forgive me if I fuck up.

697
00:41:28.851 --> 00:41:31.730
The pronunciation is a glove kin first.

698
00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:36.410
Canelo and uh, that took me back.

699
00:41:36.590 --> 00:41:38.360
That's what paper view boxing used to be.

700
00:41:38.361 --> 00:41:40.310
I'm not saying he didn't get fucked every once in a while back then,

701
00:41:40.311 --> 00:41:43.940
but it was just too, they was fucking forehead to forehead, just it was a war,

702
00:41:45.080 --> 00:41:48.310
feeling each other out, respecting each other and all that shit. And then, uh,

703
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:49.820
the usual bullshit happened.

704
00:41:51.230 --> 00:41:55.910
You know how that fucking lady sot one 18 to one 10. I mean, I, I you, Jesus, I,

705
00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.170
I don't know shit about boxing. And I was like, what the fuck? Um,

706
00:42:00.290 --> 00:42:03.410
and I loved how Roy Jones in the fucking end goes like, I, he goes,

707
00:42:03.411 --> 00:42:06.260
I loved that it was a draw, you know,

708
00:42:06.470 --> 00:42:09.970
cause that means we get to see this again and next time there's definitely gonna

709
00:42:09.990 --> 00:42:14.690
be a decision. And I, I fell, it felt like he was like,

710
00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:16.610
they were like, Roy, don't bring this up.

711
00:42:16.611 --> 00:42:20.270
This is the Illuminati script of boxing. Please don't bring this shit up. It's,

712
00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.900
this whole fucking thing is, uh, that it was going to be a drive.

713
00:42:23.901 --> 00:42:27.410
We had any way to make this thing be a fucking draw so we could do it again.

714
00:42:29.030 --> 00:42:32.460
Um, but it was great. I was a great fucking fight. It's,

715
00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:36.030
I thought a glove can clearly won the fight. Um,

716
00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.630
I just thought he was backing up the whole fucking time. And, uh,

717
00:42:41.650 --> 00:42:43.580
I know Kendall had some big shots towards the end,

718
00:42:43.581 --> 00:42:47.720
but he glove could just fucking walk. He ate them all up. He ate 'em up.

719
00:42:47.721 --> 00:42:49.460
He just Guinea would back off for a second.

720
00:42:49.461 --> 00:42:52.050
You just come back and then he would fucking give him, you know, if he took two,

721
00:42:52.250 --> 00:42:56.360
we'd come back and give him two. I just thought, you know, I dunno,

722
00:42:56.390 --> 00:42:59.240
I agreed with too, that, that fucking guy who screams all the time.

723
00:43:00.060 --> 00:43:02.570
<v 6>No, I got the bike. [inaudible]</v>

724
00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.950
<v 1>that guy always screaming. Uh,</v>

725
00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.990
do they have him in the crowd so we can't hear himself?

726
00:43:07.991 --> 00:43:11.500
Does he not have headsets on? I love that he yells every fucking time. Um,

727
00:43:13.410 --> 00:43:16.230
I dunno. I thoroughly enjoyed it. The decision obviously stuck,

728
00:43:16.231 --> 00:43:18.480
but I did not feel that I got fucked on my money.

729
00:43:18.481 --> 00:43:20.730
I feel like the fighters got fucked. And, uh,

730
00:43:20.731 --> 00:43:24.870
I retweeted this rant that Teddy Atlas went on and, um,

731
00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:28.270
it was, you know, somebody has to say,

732
00:43:28.370 --> 00:43:33.120
so I just don't understand how it's still that corrupt. It's just they've never,

733
00:43:33.121 --> 00:43:37.290
like, it was weird, like Vegas was totally corrupt and totally mobbed up.

734
00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:41.190
And then they cleaned it up by putting those corporations in there who then

735
00:43:41.250 --> 00:43:43.500
fucked you on everything, including the steak.

736
00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:47.973
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

737
00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.720
<v 1>Why can't they clean up boxing?</v>

738
00:43:49.750 --> 00:43:53.050
Can they get the mob out of this so that the corporations can come over on the

739
00:43:53.051 --> 00:43:56.650
legal side of stealing and fuck people more than they ever have? Maybe the app,

740
00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.680
I have no idea. I don't understand it,

741
00:44:00.640 --> 00:44:05.300
but a teddy atlas said, I'm gonna,

742
00:44:05.301 --> 00:44:07.070
I'm gonna Butcher. And how he said it, he said,

743
00:44:07.071 --> 00:44:10.310
those guys went in the ring and came out less of who they were.

744
00:44:10.311 --> 00:44:14.900
Meaning that they, they, you do permanent damage to yourself.

745
00:44:16.180 --> 00:44:20.830
Meanwhile, they will break it down the a, they will break it down,

746
00:44:20.940 --> 00:44:22.850
the power shots and all of that type of shit.

747
00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:26.070
It's like I was watching Rogan's recap of it

748
00:44:27.580 --> 00:44:29.020
with Jim Norton and, uh,

749
00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:34.710
Rogan read some stats where this guy, he took, okay. You know, here's the,

750
00:44:35.040 --> 00:44:39.150
blew his head. He took 118 punches to the fucking head.

751
00:44:40.550 --> 00:44:43.100
I haven't taken 118 punches to the head my life.

752
00:44:44.710 --> 00:44:46.820
My bolded brother used to beat the shit out of me all the time,

753
00:44:46.821 --> 00:44:48.410
but we knew you kept it to the body.

754
00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:53.360
That's what your father wouldn't see it when he came home. Um, so,

755
00:44:53.361 --> 00:44:56.270
but other than that, I mean it was, it was great.

756
00:44:56.271 --> 00:44:59.570
It was everything that I knew that may, whether, and, um,

757
00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:01.760
McGregor wasn't going to be,

758
00:45:01.820 --> 00:45:05.270
and that's why I didn't rent it and that's why I spent my money on that.

759
00:45:05.271 --> 00:45:06.340
I still got fucked.

760
00:45:08.230 --> 00:45:09.063
<v 5>Um,</v>

761
00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:12.930
<v 1>but, uh, is Tommy Morrison still alive? Okay.</v>

762
00:45:12.931 --> 00:45:15.600
I have to hit pause on this cause I gotta watch this shit.

763
00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:18.510
He's a relative of fucking,

764
00:45:19.910 --> 00:45:20.420
<v 5>okay.</v>

765
00:45:20.420 --> 00:45:24.350
<v 1>John Wayne, in case you didn't know. I'm sorry. He's a boxer back in the day.</v>

766
00:45:25.390 --> 00:45:29.840
Uh, all right. I got to read some of the, uh, shit here for this week.

767
00:45:29.841 --> 00:45:32.210
I can't see anything here doing this in my fucking living room.

768
00:45:33.380 --> 00:45:35.030
We bought these things when, when we, uh,

769
00:45:35.300 --> 00:45:36.900
yet another thing I had fixed on this house,

770
00:45:37.070 --> 00:45:40.070
say these fucking awful lights on the wall. So we bought these sconces,

771
00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:43.280
these really fancy fucking things. And the thing,

772
00:45:43.310 --> 00:45:48.290
the fancy thing in front of the light is so God damn thick that it,

773
00:45:48.370 --> 00:45:49.890
it always seems like it's on a dimmer.

774
00:45:51.030 --> 00:45:53.130
They probably should have just bought a higher what? Bulb?

775
00:45:54.380 --> 00:45:54.750
<v 5>Yeah,</v>

776
00:45:54.750 --> 00:45:56.640
<v 1>I dunno. This has gotta be one of those moments where you're like,</v>

777
00:45:56.641 --> 00:45:57.990
why the fuck am I listening to this guy?

778
00:45:57.991 --> 00:46:00.300
He's talking about the fucking light bulbs in his living room. I'm sorry.

779
00:46:00.680 --> 00:46:05.070
All right. DNA testing at Ravens game. No boy,

780
00:46:05.670 --> 00:46:09.390
dear bill, I love the podcast. Love you. Stand up a love F is for family.

781
00:46:09.391 --> 00:46:09.781
Thank you.

782
00:46:09.781 --> 00:46:12.900
I have to start promoting that at my standup shows too because I feel like a lot

783
00:46:12.901 --> 00:46:17.340
of people still don't know the shows on. Um, so if you get a chance to be,

784
00:46:17.530 --> 00:46:19.980
give the show, tell your friends about it and everything,

785
00:46:19.981 --> 00:46:24.270
just so we can continue doing the show will be awesome. Um, you said,

786
00:46:24.271 --> 00:46:28.950
I wanted to hear your opinion on this very weird giveaway at Sunday's ravens

787
00:46:28.951 --> 00:46:29.784
game.

788
00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:34.140
I'm a season ticket holder for the ravens and it's not unusual to get the little

789
00:46:34.141 --> 00:46:38.280
freebies when you ant the stadium. Commemorative coins, beer, koozies flags,

790
00:46:38.281 --> 00:46:39.600
et Cetera. Uh,

791
00:46:39.601 --> 00:46:44.601
Sunday is the home opener and some company is giving away free DNA tests.

792
00:46:45.241 --> 00:46:50.190
So I guess has happened yesterday. Free DNA test. What are you trying to do?

793
00:46:50.490 --> 00:46:52.730
Figure out if you're a fucking human being. Um,

794
00:46:52.800 --> 00:46:57.630
and it's not even some ancestry.com type shit that could give you some semi

795
00:46:57.631 --> 00:46:58.441
useful information.

796
00:46:58.441 --> 00:47:01.860
You're not getting any useful information from ancestry.com they're doing what

797
00:47:01.861 --> 00:47:03.810
this company's doing. I don't know what they're doing,

798
00:47:03.811 --> 00:47:05.170
but they're not trying to help you out.

799
00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.240
Do you really need to know how much Scottish blood you have in you that you

800
00:47:09.241 --> 00:47:10.800
really need one? So what you can do, what?

801
00:47:10.801 --> 00:47:14.280
Go out and go feel justified buying a fucking kilt. You're not Scottish,

802
00:47:14.281 --> 00:47:15.114
you're a mud.

803
00:47:16.430 --> 00:47:17.220
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

804
00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:19.610
<v 1>Um, the article I linked says, uh,</v>

805
00:47:19.870 --> 00:47:22.540
they're testing for four genes.

806
00:47:23.110 --> 00:47:27.520
The test offers insight into your mind, body and health is what they claim.

807
00:47:27.910 --> 00:47:32.290
It seems like this company wants a bunch of data and they figured that an NFL

808
00:47:32.291 --> 00:47:37.060
game is a great way to get 70,000 mouth breathing fucking morons. Um, that,

809
00:47:37.190 --> 00:47:41.530
that part was me. 70,000 people deed to 70,000 people's DNA all at once.

810
00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.810
Uh, the company has also partnered with the 49ers.

811
00:47:44.890 --> 00:47:47.950
So testing might come to San Francisco soon. What are your thoughts?

812
00:47:47.951 --> 00:47:49.980
Keep up the good work and go fuck yourself. Ah,

813
00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:51.910
I think I know exactly what this is.

814
00:47:54.030 --> 00:47:54.863
<v 4>Um,</v>

815
00:47:55.740 --> 00:47:59.640
<v 1>in the future, people's DNA is going to be,</v>

816
00:47:59.820 --> 00:48:02.640
it's just starting to become a revenue source.

817
00:48:03.750 --> 00:48:07.320
The way your phone number and all of this other shit that they get from you at

818
00:48:07.321 --> 00:48:09.210
cvs and all these fucking places.

819
00:48:09.211 --> 00:48:13.260
It was another revenue stream where you are buying shaving cream, tampons,

820
00:48:13.261 --> 00:48:14.280
whatever the fuck you doing.

821
00:48:14.460 --> 00:48:17.640
And then they would get personal information from you that then they could then

822
00:48:17.641 --> 00:48:20.490
sell to other fucking companies. Um,

823
00:48:20.491 --> 00:48:23.040
I think it is now that they've exhausted all of that.

824
00:48:23.041 --> 00:48:27.570
They've now moving onto fingerprints, face recognition in DNA,

825
00:48:28.290 --> 00:48:31.410
and they're going to share this with everybody. And, uh,

826
00:48:31.411 --> 00:48:33.480
I know the robots are coming. I don't know how to,

827
00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:35.460
I don't know where this all lands.

828
00:48:36.510 --> 00:48:40.020
I know that there's talks in the future that human beings could be meshed with

829
00:48:40.021 --> 00:48:40.854
robots.

830
00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:43.700
<v 4>Um,</v>

831
00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:44.660
<v 1>if I had to guess,</v>

832
00:48:44.661 --> 00:48:48.290
they're probably gonna get to the point where with your DNA they can grow

833
00:48:48.291 --> 00:48:51.170
another you and say, well that's not really you.

834
00:48:51.171 --> 00:48:53.150
The real you is going to the ravens game.

835
00:48:53.151 --> 00:48:56.240
So we're going to do all kinds of Nazi doctors,

836
00:48:56.241 --> 00:49:01.241
Nazi doctor s type experiments on this with the fucking robot before we released

837
00:49:01.941 --> 00:49:05.570
this to the public. That's where I think it's going.

838
00:49:06.990 --> 00:49:07.823
All right.

839
00:49:08.510 --> 00:49:08.900
<v 5>Okay.</v>

840
00:49:08.900 --> 00:49:09.500
<v 1>And you know,</v>

841
00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:14.500
I don't want my twin adult brother coming into this world at 51 years of age

842
00:49:17.030 --> 00:49:18.980
cause I figured another two years they'll probably start doing it

843
00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:22.610
and getting a fucking, you know,

844
00:49:22.640 --> 00:49:25.700
bionic arm put on and he's screaming and fucking Panke has,

845
00:49:25.701 --> 00:49:29.780
God knows they're not gonna use fucking anesthetic cause that fucking

846
00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:31.300
<v 5>okay.</v>

847
00:49:31.300 --> 00:49:32.170
<v 1>DNA version.</v>

848
00:49:32.171 --> 00:49:36.520
You will be the property of a corporation and we'll have no rights to fucking

849
00:49:38.310 --> 00:49:39.110
<v 4>um,</v>

850
00:49:39.110 --> 00:49:39.943
<v 1>anesthetic.</v>

851
00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:42.720
<v 5>Yeah.</v>

852
00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:44.460
<v 1>Why don't I write Scifi? You know,</v>

853
00:49:44.461 --> 00:49:48.150
I did the whole fucking thing about how you had to take a test and if she

854
00:49:48.151 --> 00:49:50.220
flunked the test on the population control,

855
00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.670
you just walk into the ocean and now there's a movie coming out about that.

856
00:49:54.780 --> 00:49:56.340
I don't know, maybe I'm just not original.

857
00:49:56.341 --> 00:49:58.770
Maybe I should start writing these fucking things and that sounds like a cool

858
00:49:58.771 --> 00:50:02.400
fucking movie, right? Uh, you have to go save yourself.

859
00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:07.201
You know,

860
00:50:07.201 --> 00:50:11.270
Hollywood do some fucking creepy happy ending where you're just staring there

861
00:50:11.290 --> 00:50:14.730
yourself touching each other's face and everybody's fucking crying.

862
00:50:16.750 --> 00:50:17.583
<v 4>Um,</v>

863
00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:20.470
<v 1>I dunno, you throw Willsmith in there somehow it's a winner. All right.</v>

864
00:50:21.010 --> 00:50:25.060
Whiny fan complaining. Alright, how do you bill,

865
00:50:25.480 --> 00:50:30.110
I'm a four year podcast listener and I saw you love and San Antonio earlier this

866
00:50:30.110 --> 00:50:30.470
year.

867
00:50:30.470 --> 00:50:35.030
I think you're a layers guy and obviously it's your podcast and I should go fuck

868
00:50:35.031 --> 00:50:39.500
myself, but I think your Trump positions are kind of unfair. Um,

869
00:50:40.260 --> 00:50:42.710
okay. I'm not another political fucking person.

870
00:50:42.711 --> 00:50:44.300
He did call himself off for being,

871
00:50:45.140 --> 00:50:47.870
I think your Trump positions are kind of unfair.

872
00:50:48.260 --> 00:50:52.180
Well then you think my Hillary ones are fair. All right. God bless you. Um,

873
00:50:52.220 --> 00:50:53.810
I know you're just a comedian.

874
00:50:53.870 --> 00:50:58.490
I know you have a lot of fans in the quote real America. Oh,

875
00:50:58.491 --> 00:51:02.120
there's the left talking down to the right. Okay.

876
00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:05.030
And so you have to toe a line.

877
00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:09.130
Isn't this, this is the classic,

878
00:51:09.131 --> 00:51:11.690
I really helped the person who wrote this as listening. Sir, you're,

879
00:51:11.910 --> 00:51:16.910
and you are inventing all of this in your head because you're upset about

880
00:51:16.961 --> 00:51:19.630
something politically. Okay?

881
00:51:20.410 --> 00:51:22.270
Are you mad at what I'm talking about about Trump?

882
00:51:22.300 --> 00:51:24.640
Is that what this is that you feel?

883
00:51:24.641 --> 00:51:27.730
I have to tow some sort of fucking white liberal line because I'm out here in

884
00:51:27.731 --> 00:51:32.050
Hollywood. Um, but Trump is,

885
00:51:32.380 --> 00:51:34.930
to my mind, obviously a dangerous guy.

886
00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:38.020
I won't go through my whole list of grievance grievances,

887
00:51:38.021 --> 00:51:41.740
but he thinks climate change is a Chinese hoax.

888
00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:43.181
Uh,

889
00:51:43.181 --> 00:51:48.181
supports white supremacists and just this week through the lives of 800,000,

890
00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:51.880
what am I going to make sure he didn't use any comments?

891
00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.800
8 million people who are brought here as children into disarray.

892
00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.750
And I know every president has skeletons, but even a liberal like me,

893
00:52:02.710 --> 00:52:03.070
Oh, is it?

894
00:52:03.070 --> 00:52:08.070
Hillary person can see this guy is nothing like w w or George H.

895
00:52:09.910 --> 00:52:14.700
Uh, dude, when did I say I liked this guy? I never did.

896
00:52:15.240 --> 00:52:17.040
I never said that. I liked the guy.

897
00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:21.840
I just said people freaking out of bottom and losing their fucking shit.

898
00:52:21.841 --> 00:52:25.440
I should've been more specific like fucking white people acting like the needle

899
00:52:25.441 --> 00:52:29.970
in your life was gonna change that fucking far. All right. By the way,

900
00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:34.260
um, you know, if you really want to see a bunch of skeleton,

901
00:52:34.261 --> 00:52:38.760
both of these people, I mean, this election was essentially 2:00 AM at a bar.

902
00:52:38.761 --> 00:52:43.170
I mean, you had to go home with somebody, right? Probably shouldn't have. Um,

903
00:52:44.790 --> 00:52:49.420
listen, this fucking guy thinks climate change is a hoax. Fine. Alright.

904
00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:53.520
Hillary was all for bailing out these fucking banks in 2008,

905
00:52:53.521 --> 00:52:55.290
which is exactly what the fuck happened.

906
00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:59.340
And all these people who stayed in Florida riding out the fucking storm and

907
00:52:59.341 --> 00:53:02.430
everybody's making fun of them and saying how dumb they are for staying there.

908
00:53:02.670 --> 00:53:07.020
They're probably upside down in their house and unlike the bankers don't have

909
00:53:07.021 --> 00:53:11.880
another house that they can go to. Yeah. Evacuate the area and do what?

910
00:53:12.690 --> 00:53:15.900
Go with half of the Florida and sit in a fucking waffle house in Georgia.

911
00:53:15.901 --> 00:53:18.240
And then what? I don't have enough gas money to get back.

912
00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:23.100
I love the complete lack of sympathy for people that can completely fucked in

913
00:53:23.101 --> 00:53:26.000
2008. Okay. Um,

914
00:53:26.030 --> 00:53:28.130
which Hillary was totally all about.

915
00:53:28.910 --> 00:53:32.810
She was also all about fucking, you know,

916
00:53:32.840 --> 00:53:36.890
ignoring the wishes of the people on the left who voted more for fucking Bernie

917
00:53:36.890 --> 00:53:41.870
Sanders according to this trial and colluded with the Democratic Party to ignore

918
00:53:41.871 --> 00:53:44.890
those votes and box Bernie Sanders out in.

919
00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:48.890
And she just took the nomination and all of a sudden she's got the fucking balls

920
00:53:48.891 --> 00:53:53.120
to sit here and talk about the electoral college. Okay?

921
00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:56.810
She's not a good person either. And I'm not saying w is I told you I was done.

922
00:53:57.050 --> 00:53:58.970
I want to say WME, sorry, Donald Trump.

923
00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:04.000
I said I was done with Donald Trump when he said that both sides can take

924
00:54:04.910 --> 00:54:06.380
contributed to the violence,

925
00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:09.560
that he couldn't even get himself to say that those Nazis might be a little out

926
00:54:09.561 --> 00:54:13.670
of their fucking minds. The neonazis. I told you I was done with the guy. Okay,

927
00:54:13.671 --> 00:54:18.140
but you hate the guy so much. You're hearing what you want to hear. All right?

928
00:54:18.350 --> 00:54:20.900
Maybe I don't try to trash Trump enough on this podcast,

929
00:54:20.901 --> 00:54:24.200
but I don't feel that I need to. Everybody,

930
00:54:24.410 --> 00:54:28.160
at least in my profession has a bit on how fucking stupid the guy is.

931
00:54:31.180 --> 00:54:35.040
Billion dry mouth talking about this shit. So I don't, and for you to sit there,

932
00:54:35.041 --> 00:54:38.190
you fucking content. After four years of listening to my podcast,

933
00:54:38.191 --> 00:54:40.400
acting like I told some sort of line. Did you?

934
00:54:40.530 --> 00:54:42.060
Do you ever listen to my fucking advertising?

935
00:54:42.070 --> 00:54:44.970
I lose advertisers all the fucking time. Okay.

936
00:54:44.971 --> 00:54:46.230
If I was towing some sort of line,

937
00:54:46.231 --> 00:54:49.590
I would read those things like I was on fucking Lawrence Welk, hype and Geritol.

938
00:54:49.591 --> 00:54:51.510
I don't. Okay.

939
00:54:53.050 --> 00:54:57.850
I told a line as far as I say, what the fuck? I think it's funny.

940
00:54:57.910 --> 00:55:00.100
That's the line that I am towing here, sir. I'm sorry.

941
00:55:00.101 --> 00:55:04.150
The guy that you wanted to fucking win didn't fucking win. I know. I know.

942
00:55:04.151 --> 00:55:06.490
Trump's out of his fucking mind and I don't need you wagon.

943
00:55:06.610 --> 00:55:09.160
You fucking finger at me. Give me a God damn fucking lecture

944
00:55:11.050 --> 00:55:14.250
is if I don't understand that this guy's fucked up. Okay,

945
00:55:15.090 --> 00:55:17.630
so why don't you look at your own up your own fucking skirt.

946
00:55:19.780 --> 00:55:20.140
<v 0>Okay.</v>

947
00:55:20.140 --> 00:55:22.710
<v 1>It'd be a little more even handed all you fucking guys. I mean,</v>

948
00:55:22.711 --> 00:55:25.050
I guess you got to whine about Trump because he's actually the fucking president

949
00:55:25.051 --> 00:55:27.720
of Jesus Christ. The fucking pass.

950
00:55:28.710 --> 00:55:31.740
I don't know what the fuck it is that Hillary gets is unbelievable.

951
00:55:33.800 --> 00:55:38.770
Ps, Hillary sucks. That's all I get on this side. You know, he said, look man,

952
00:55:38.771 --> 00:55:41.410
I just think that despite what you're saying about being comedian,

953
00:55:41.411 --> 00:55:44.530
you do have a platform. Fuck you buddy. Fuck you.

954
00:55:45.490 --> 00:55:50.170
You're not putting that on me. All right. I can tell you this right now, dude.

955
00:55:50.290 --> 00:55:55.290
If you get your political information from a fucking standup comedian who can't

956
00:55:55.391 --> 00:55:56.800
even read out loud,

957
00:55:57.880 --> 00:56:02.560
you use this thing to decide who the leader of the free world is going to be.

958
00:56:02.830 --> 00:56:06.700
I can't help you. What am I supposed to do? Do you know what I would say to you?

959
00:56:06.850 --> 00:56:08.950
Send you fucking DNA to the ravens.

960
00:56:12.110 --> 00:56:13.840
I'm anyways, you do have a platform.

961
00:56:13.841 --> 00:56:16.030
And while I'd never dare to tell you what to say,

962
00:56:16.031 --> 00:56:19.810
I hope you will consider what happens when you play down the danger of his

963
00:56:19.811 --> 00:56:22.990
behaviors. Um, let me ask you this.

964
00:56:23.260 --> 00:56:27.550
What exactly would be happening now if the other fucking bought and paid for

965
00:56:27.670 --> 00:56:30.040
fucking Twat went in there? What do you think would happen?

966
00:56:31.290 --> 00:56:36.050
What do you think would happen? Huh? Do you honestly,

967
00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:39.410
when, while she admits that global warming is real, what do you think?

968
00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:43.870
What happened? Do you think she's going to do anything?

969
00:56:44.410 --> 00:56:48.310
Most the most she could be in there for is eight. Fuck. They just wait them out.

970
00:56:49.270 --> 00:56:54.270
Al Gore in 1992 said that there has to be a car that gets at least a hundred

971
00:56:55.270 --> 00:56:58.450
miles a gallon by the fucking year, 2000, something like that.

972
00:56:58.451 --> 00:57:01.780
And it just kept delaying the project and delaying it and delaying and delaying

973
00:57:01.781 --> 00:57:05.800
and delaying it. And then they were out of office and it just fucking went away.

974
00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:12.190
There you go. So I don't know what to tell you. I have to tell you buddy.

975
00:57:12.660 --> 00:57:17.320
Um, I always vote outside of the democratic and the Republican Party.

976
00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.020
Okay. Unless I find somebody within them,

977
00:57:20.021 --> 00:57:22.300
like a Bernie Sanders who I feel will actually,

978
00:57:22.540 --> 00:57:26.710
hopefully make more people within those bought and paid for fucking groups.

979
00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:31.780
Uh, I dunno, take a stand for fucking regular people. I mean, that's what I do.

980
00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:36.780
Okay. I don't like Trump. The guy makes me sick to my stomach. I think he's a,

981
00:57:36.790 --> 00:57:39.820
I absolutely think the guy's fucking racist. Uh,

982
00:57:39.910 --> 00:57:42.610
but I also think Hillary is the fucking devil.

983
00:57:42.670 --> 00:57:47.560
And in a lot of ways we sidestepped a bunch of other shit. Okay.

984
00:57:47.590 --> 00:57:50.670
We walked into a bunch of this shit with Trump, but you definitely stepped up.

985
00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:53.140
Come on man. Everybody,

986
00:57:53.620 --> 00:57:58.180
anybody with any remote sense of intelligence knows that, you know,

987
00:57:58.181 --> 00:58:01.330
that was the fucking Blue Bonnet bull. All right. That wasn't the fucking,

988
00:58:02.140 --> 00:58:06.850
that wasn't Alabama verse fucking Clemson or Shit. That was a, you know,

989
00:58:06.880 --> 00:58:10.390
that was the holiday bowl election. Alright. Actual money based on I, I,

990
00:58:10.440 --> 00:58:15.240
you know, and I dunno, I dunno why you needed to send me that dude. You,

991
00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:18.060
you honestly think that I want to see fucking kids get sent out of this country.

992
00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:22.890
I don't, I don't. Okay, so stop turning me into the fucking,

993
00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:26.550
you know what it is? Do you want this country's fucked out.

994
00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:30.420
There's a guy who can't read out loud that does a podcast twice a week.

995
00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.980
And I'm telling you that is,

996
00:58:32.550 --> 00:58:37.530
if we could just get him to politically say what we feel,

997
00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:42.720
I think we could turn this country around. We're taking collars.

998
00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:47.520
I said, buddy, um, actual money based on gold. Hey,

999
00:58:47.850 --> 00:58:48.810
Billy gold bullets.

1000
00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:52.861
That'd be great.

1001
00:58:52.861 --> 00:58:55.710
Have some gold bullocks in that fucking diamond and crusted pouch.

1002
00:58:56.220 --> 00:59:01.080
I was listening to Rogan's podcast recently and he had a guy called Peter Shift

1003
00:59:01.081 --> 00:59:05.730
on and he was talking about gold money.com.

1004
00:59:05.731 --> 00:59:09.270
This is basically a private gold reserve where you can buy gold,

1005
00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.400
which is held in a secure vault. Oh, is it?

1006
00:59:15.390 --> 00:59:20.160
Listen, you give us our money and we'll have, we'll hold your gold.

1007
00:59:20.730 --> 00:59:23.090
Great. So they keep my cash and the gold.

1008
00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:27.500
Do I got to send them a donkey to and using a prepaid mastercard,

1009
00:59:27.501 --> 00:59:32.501
you can pay for goods and services with your money backed by gold or platinum if

1010
00:59:32.961 --> 00:59:36.050
you'd rather buy that. I would do that immediately.

1011
00:59:36.051 --> 00:59:39.470
Or when the dollar crash is effectively what the banks used to do

1012
00:59:41.090 --> 00:59:45.200
before they sold the foundations of our currency here is here in the UK.

1013
00:59:45.201 --> 00:59:49.400
Gordon Brown sold all the diamonds that back sterling,

1014
00:59:50.260 --> 00:59:53.880
uh, when the bank shit the bed. Um,

1015
00:59:54.030 --> 00:59:56.760
I don't know what any of that means here in the UK. Gordon Brown,

1016
00:59:56.940 --> 00:59:58.560
who's Gordon Brown? Or is that a bank

1017
01:00:00.510 --> 01:00:05.510
like fucking j p Morgan sold all the diamonds that back sterling when the banks

1018
01:00:05.961 --> 01:00:08.070
shit the bed. Oh, okay. So you got your money back.

1019
01:00:08.071 --> 01:00:12.740
Cause I was saying I just this minute signed up to something,

1020
01:00:12.770 --> 01:00:15.510
a commercial and I'll be putting some money into it,

1021
01:00:15.540 --> 01:00:19.070
although not all my money as it's always best to diversify when you stash your

1022
01:00:19.071 --> 01:00:19.381
saving.

1023
01:00:19.381 --> 01:00:23.310
I think it is much better than bitcoin as it's actually based on something of

1024
01:00:23.311 --> 01:00:24.990
value. I love you to go fuck yourself, sir.

1025
01:00:24.991 --> 01:00:28.200
Why don't you just take your money and go buy a gold coin?

1026
01:00:31.240 --> 01:00:32.500
Why don't you just do that?

1027
01:00:32.830 --> 01:00:37.830
Why don't you take your paper and go buy some gold and leave with the gold

1028
01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:42.010
rather than giving your money to this fucking person you're not gonna meet.

1029
01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:45.130
And he tells you that he has. How do you know there's gold there?

1030
01:00:45.340 --> 01:00:50.140
He's basically doing what they're doing with Fort Knox where they say there's

1031
01:00:50.170 --> 01:00:54.340
all this golden there and then there's rumors that it's fucking empty. Um,

1032
01:00:54.370 --> 01:00:56.650
I liked the direction you're going in, but, uh,

1033
01:00:56.680 --> 01:01:01.120
I think you a went out of the frying pan into the fire with that one grant.

1034
01:01:01.121 --> 01:01:03.970
I don't want to shit on whatever that guy's doing because I got your abridged

1035
01:01:03.971 --> 01:01:05.050
version of it. But um,

1036
01:01:05.110 --> 01:01:10.110
that reminded me of that movie blow where Johnny Depp's character gives them $2

1037
01:01:10.390 --> 01:01:13.450
million in cash and they give them a book that says $2 million on it.

1038
01:01:13.451 --> 01:01:16.810
Then he goes to jail. He never gets his fucking money. All right.

1039
01:01:16.840 --> 01:01:19.750
My girlfriend's daughter is causing us to break up.

1040
01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:25.750
Is that a bad thing? Um, Jesus Christ. I mean,

1041
01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:27.460
you're already dating somebody that already has a kid,

1042
01:01:27.461 --> 01:01:30.220
so that's going to be Ari a hundred times harder to make that fucking work.

1043
01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:32.050
And then the kid doesn't even like you. So I mean,

1044
01:01:32.051 --> 01:01:36.800
maybe she's doing a solid here. Um, hey bill.

1045
01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:40.220
Okay, here we go. So my girl and I have seven years,

1046
01:01:40.221 --> 01:01:44.000
both worked for the same company and I was offered a better position in Florida

1047
01:01:44.270 --> 01:01:46.910
and she was also offered a position as well.

1048
01:01:46.940 --> 01:01:50.000
Now here's where the daughter comes in and fucks up the flow. Yeah,

1049
01:01:50.360 --> 01:01:52.310
cause she fucking probably wants to stay at her school.

1050
01:01:53.330 --> 01:01:55.160
Her daughter's 14 is just starting.

1051
01:01:55.161 --> 01:01:58.880
High schoolers are foods refusing to move and her mother is going along with not

1052
01:01:58.881 --> 01:02:03.860
forcing her to move and is going to pass her, is going to pass in our position.

1053
01:02:03.861 --> 01:02:08.810
We agreed I will not move down and get things in order until she wait.

1054
01:02:08.840 --> 01:02:09.500
We agreed.

1055
01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:14.500
I will move down and get things in order until she gets there in four years now

1056
01:02:14.751 --> 01:02:19.200
for the past few weeks we've been getting into more fights and our reasoning for

1057
01:02:19.201 --> 01:02:21.870
the fight is sit down for this one bill.

1058
01:02:22.230 --> 01:02:27.000
She says it's easier for me to leave when she's mad.

1059
01:02:29.950 --> 01:02:33.790
She's fighting you because it's easier for you to leave when she's mad.

1060
01:02:34.420 --> 01:02:36.910
I think that's the dumbest fucking reason I've ever heard.

1061
01:02:37.510 --> 01:02:38.620
Also she keeps saying,

1062
01:02:38.621 --> 01:02:43.420
I'm going to go down and find myself some black ass and ended up cheating on her

1063
01:02:43.421 --> 01:02:44.590
while I'm there.

1064
01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:49.480
We'd love to get your take on this situation and get your insight on what I

1065
01:02:49.481 --> 01:02:54.010
should do. Thanks and pick up a fucking drink. You Pussy.

1066
01:02:54.011 --> 01:02:57.520
Fuck A, I would say a,

1067
01:02:57.980 --> 01:02:58.813
<v 5>yeah,</v>

1068
01:03:00.710 --> 01:03:03.490
<v 1>I'd say there's a staggering lack of trust. Um,</v>

1069
01:03:04.230 --> 01:03:05.063
<v 5>okay.</v>

1070
01:03:05.340 --> 01:03:09.360
<v 1>I think the key here is to not get into an argument with her as to just sit down</v>

1071
01:03:09.361 --> 01:03:11.480
and try and discuss it with her and just say, listen,

1072
01:03:13.580 --> 01:03:14.413
<v 5>um,</v>

1073
01:03:15.190 --> 01:03:20.190
<v 1>we agreed that this is what I was going to do and now what it is is I know,</v>

1074
01:03:21.081 --> 01:03:23.840
I think this is what happened. What she did was,

1075
01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:28.340
is she did what was best for her daughter and she put herself with you in

1076
01:03:28.341 --> 01:03:29.174
second,

1077
01:03:29.660 --> 01:03:33.740
but she still sounds like cares about you and the fact that you're down there

1078
01:03:33.741 --> 01:03:36.050
and she's worried that you're going to leave and she misses you.

1079
01:03:36.110 --> 01:03:39.560
I think that that's what's happening. So I would just ask her,

1080
01:03:39.561 --> 01:03:44.120
is this some like misdirected anger? I will.

1081
01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:46.280
You're actually just saying that you miss me and you love me.

1082
01:03:47.670 --> 01:03:49.470
Is that what you say in it? We could work through this.

1083
01:03:49.471 --> 01:03:51.270
And then if you're really not going to fuck around,

1084
01:03:51.390 --> 01:03:52.980
we're honor and you're really going to see it through,

1085
01:03:52.981 --> 01:03:56.220
then you want to be able to just say, listen, I'll do whatever it takes.

1086
01:03:56.221 --> 01:03:58.350
I'm going to be there in four years. If you're not lying,

1087
01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:03.540
I think you ought to be able to work your way through it. And um,

1088
01:04:03.570 --> 01:04:06.780
I think this has less to do with the daughter than it has to do with the fact

1089
01:04:06.781 --> 01:04:09.900
that she just misses you and she's afraid that you're going to find somebody

1090
01:04:09.901 --> 01:04:14.660
else down there. Evidently wherever you moved where a,

1091
01:04:14.950 --> 01:04:16.490
there's a bunch of black ass down there.

1092
01:04:21.090 --> 01:04:21.570
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1093
01:04:21.570 --> 01:04:22.870
<v 1>That's what I would guess. So I,</v>

1094
01:04:22.871 --> 01:04:25.230
you guys need to get on the same page and you'd have an honest moment with

1095
01:04:25.231 --> 01:04:28.440
yourself before you fucking slowly tear the bandaid off.

1096
01:04:28.470 --> 01:04:32.790
Either get the fuck out of it or totally commit to her. Um, I mean,

1097
01:04:32.791 --> 01:04:35.550
seven years at this point. Why aren't you dropping a fucking ring on her

1098
01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:40.560
that to shut her up for a good couple of weekends. Um,

1099
01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:43.980
it won't shut her up permanently. I can tell you that right now. Oh,

1100
01:04:43.981 --> 01:04:44.990
I can tell you some stories. Yeah.

1101
01:04:45.010 --> 01:04:46.570
<v 8>So</v>

1102
01:04:46.630 --> 01:04:50.160
<v 1>can I tell you so, oh, sit right back in a [inaudible] latte live.</v>

1103
01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:55.120
May read guy who jumps through all the fucking hoops and still gets the evil

1104
01:04:55.500 --> 01:04:56.333
light. All right, Mike.

1105
01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:00.253
<v 5>Okay.</v>

1106
01:05:01.010 --> 01:05:05.660
<v 1>Uh, my wife is, uh, who, uh, dear bill Billy butter tits.</v>

1107
01:05:05.661 --> 01:05:08.630
Fuck you on losing weight. Uh, my wife,

1108
01:05:08.631 --> 01:05:13.190
my wife decided to have an affair four months ago. Oh boy.

1109
01:05:13.220 --> 01:05:14.840
Before I knew what was going on,

1110
01:05:14.841 --> 01:05:19.300
she told me she didn't know if she wanted to be married to me anymore and that

1111
01:05:19.301 --> 01:05:21.700
it was because I was too controlling.

1112
01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:24.700
And by controlling,

1113
01:05:24.701 --> 01:05:28.960
she means I told her as a stay at home mom,

1114
01:05:28.961 --> 01:05:30.400
I had expectations.

1115
01:05:30.430 --> 01:05:34.600
I expected her to keep the house clean and take care of our children as we

1116
01:05:34.601 --> 01:05:38.240
agreed when she quit her job. Yeah. I mean,

1117
01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:41.950
which is a totally fair ask,

1118
01:05:43.150 --> 01:05:47.200
you know, but nowadays in this world of hyper fucking feminism,

1119
01:05:48.100 --> 01:05:51.490
not all feminists are bad, but the fucking, the uh,

1120
01:05:52.270 --> 01:05:56.950
the god is great fucking crazy ones there. Um, yeah,

1121
01:05:56.951 --> 01:05:59.050
they would say that that was sexist. That you know, well,

1122
01:05:59.051 --> 01:06:03.910
why don't you work all fucking day and then come home and also have the house

1123
01:06:03.911 --> 01:06:05.830
clean. You know what I mean? Let me look. If you got a bunch of kids,

1124
01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:09.250
it can only be so fucking clean, but at least you could do is order a pizza.

1125
01:06:09.251 --> 01:06:11.020
Right? Um, anyways,

1126
01:06:11.021 --> 01:06:14.230
I would come home to her friends being at the house and her drinking all

1127
01:06:14.231 --> 01:06:18.740
afternoon while Jesus Christ. She's not even making an effort. Yeah.

1128
01:06:18.750 --> 01:06:22.200
This is what happens when you draft in the first round buddy. You know,

1129
01:06:22.230 --> 01:06:25.560
you get those second rounders, they, they got some to fucking proof. You know,

1130
01:06:25.830 --> 01:06:29.040
that's just what happens when you marry a temp. I'm assuming she's good looking.

1131
01:06:29.041 --> 01:06:30.090
If you putting up with this shit,

1132
01:06:30.430 --> 01:06:35.160
I would get home from work after being gone 15 hours and have to say something

1133
01:06:35.161 --> 01:06:39.240
about how I felt that the house was a wreck and there was no dinner in sight.

1134
01:06:39.300 --> 01:06:40.470
It never seemed to matter.

1135
01:06:41.010 --> 01:06:45.630
Back in January we moved to Denver from Atlanta thinking everything would be

1136
01:06:45.631 --> 01:06:46.464
better.

1137
01:06:46.890 --> 01:06:51.660
And she met this 25 year old guy who she proceeded to sneak around behind my

1138
01:06:51.661 --> 01:06:55.620
back with and bring our children around. No Way.

1139
01:06:56.430 --> 01:07:00.210
I'm 38 she's 35 we have two children and we've been married for almost 12 years.

1140
01:07:00.211 --> 01:07:04.630
Yeah, Dude. Yeah. This is a wrap. Yeah,

1141
01:07:04.660 --> 01:07:05.860
and now she wants a divorce,

1142
01:07:05.861 --> 01:07:10.060
a plans to move this kid into our home with our children.

1143
01:07:11.110 --> 01:07:14.780
Oh my God, Dude. This is the worst person ever.

1144
01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.850
I am beside myself with the thought of the divorce and this punk kid living with

1145
01:07:19.851 --> 01:07:23.150
my children. Oh my God. I know it won't last,

1146
01:07:23.151 --> 01:07:26.720
but the fact is I don't want my children to be around this piece of shit,

1147
01:07:26.750 --> 01:07:29.600
let alone living in my house. She think this is,

1148
01:07:29.630 --> 01:07:33.140
she thinks this is perfectly okay to put the kids in I through this.

1149
01:07:33.860 --> 01:07:36.590
I do love her and would do anything to save our marriage,

1150
01:07:36.591 --> 01:07:40.910
but the truth is she's delusional at this point and I guess I am too.

1151
01:07:41.420 --> 01:07:42.770
What do I do this? Stop this.

1152
01:07:42.771 --> 01:07:46.580
I know this is not my fault because I busted my ass to build the life she always

1153
01:07:46.581 --> 01:07:49.520
dreamed of. Only for her to think she can kick me out of it.

1154
01:07:49.521 --> 01:07:54.521
Any advice and or the lovely nick you could give would be greatly appreciated.

1155
01:07:54.561 --> 01:07:58.010
Thanks. And Go fuck yourself. Yeah, man. I mean this is the things,

1156
01:07:59.910 --> 01:08:01.640
this is what can happen to a guy.

1157
01:08:02.920 --> 01:08:03.753
<v 4>Um,</v>

1158
01:08:04.440 --> 01:08:08.910
<v 1>but you're not allowed to talk about this on television are you never,</v>

1159
01:08:09.090 --> 01:08:13.110
never, never. You can talk about guys being overbearing, domestic violence,

1160
01:08:13.111 --> 01:08:17.180
all those things that should be brought to light. They will not talk about this.

1161
01:08:18.560 --> 01:08:21.380
You Watch Dr Phil talk about this. You want you to blame the guy.

1162
01:08:22.520 --> 01:08:27.520
So she saying Lou reason that she saw to his cock was because you weren't paying

1163
01:08:29.571 --> 01:08:31.550
enough attention to her.

1164
01:08:31.970 --> 01:08:36.470
You need to try to pay attention more to her. Well,

1165
01:08:36.780 --> 01:08:40.370
she sucking his dick. Um,

1166
01:08:43.410 --> 01:08:47.040
what do I do to stop this? I don't know. Um,

1167
01:08:49.170 --> 01:08:49.320
<v 0>okay.</v>

1168
01:08:49.320 --> 01:08:51.870
<v 1>At this point I would be thinking about my kids</v>

1169
01:08:53.940 --> 01:08:55.380
and how I could

1170
01:08:57.030 --> 01:09:00.930
make this as look to,

1171
01:09:01.090 --> 01:09:03.840
this is what the fuck she wants to do. This is what the fuck she wants to do.

1172
01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:09.060
How you make this as easy to fucking transition your fucking divorce. Uh,

1173
01:09:09.120 --> 01:09:12.870
I could tell you this, I know you called her a whore here.

1174
01:09:12.871 --> 01:09:15.990
Don't ever say that to your kids, cause at the end of the day,

1175
01:09:15.991 --> 01:09:20.070
it's still their mother and you gotta fucking, you know,

1176
01:09:20.790 --> 01:09:24.780
you got to look the other way. Um, I dunno dude, this is,

1177
01:09:24.781 --> 01:09:27.060
this is outside my fucking realm. Um,

1178
01:09:29.900 --> 01:09:31.970
I can tell you this dude, you fucking 38 years old.

1179
01:09:31.971 --> 01:09:35.090
You sound like a great fucking guy. Um,

1180
01:09:37.310 --> 01:09:39.980
I would just, whatever you got to do for your kids, I would do that.

1181
01:09:40.040 --> 01:09:44.710
Her is a fucking lost cause. All right.

1182
01:09:44.800 --> 01:09:48.790
And I would, um, yeah,

1183
01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:52.450
I would do that and I would start [inaudible] and go out and get yourself a

1184
01:09:52.451 --> 01:09:55.850
fucking beautiful, goodhearted fucking woman. I haven't, I,

1185
01:09:56.030 --> 01:09:56.950
I'll maybe even if you have time,

1186
01:09:56.951 --> 01:09:59.890
I would go to therapy and figure out how the fuck you ended up,

1187
01:10:01.260 --> 01:10:03.180
unless she's just a total psycho, like,

1188
01:10:03.870 --> 01:10:08.550
so you don't go out and fucking marry that again. Um, figure that out.

1189
01:10:09.150 --> 01:10:11.340
But the fuck, I'm trying to marry you off already. Jesus Christ. You,

1190
01:10:11.670 --> 01:10:13.110
you just getting out of something. I don't know dude.

1191
01:10:13.111 --> 01:10:15.960
This my head spinning over this one cause I'm putting myself in your shoes.

1192
01:10:15.961 --> 01:10:19.110
I don't know what the fuck I would do. Um,

1193
01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.930
oh man, that's a rough one. Some other fucking guy going in

1194
01:10:25.680 --> 01:10:30.510
telling your kids to pipe down. I mean, Jesus fucking Christ. Uh,

1195
01:10:30.540 --> 01:10:32.430
yeah, I would, I would, uh,

1196
01:10:33.570 --> 01:10:37.800
I would talk to somebody about this way beyond my fucking educational level.

1197
01:10:37.801 --> 01:10:40.650
That's what I would do. I hope you get through this thing and uh,

1198
01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:46.830
what a fucking mistake she's making. I can tell you that,

1199
01:10:46.831 --> 01:10:49.770
but she did the way you described it. Granted, I'm gonna get your side of it.

1200
01:10:49.771 --> 01:10:52.860
She does not sound like the point a person that even when she does fuck it up,

1201
01:10:52.861 --> 01:10:56.760
she'll admit it. She probably still put it on you and uh,

1202
01:10:57.840 --> 01:10:58.740
but you know what?

1203
01:10:59.020 --> 01:11:01.050
It'll all come out in the wash and your kids are gonna know that you're a

1204
01:11:01.051 --> 01:11:05.520
fucking good guy. So, whoa. Geez. Can we, can we, can we end on that?

1205
01:11:05.550 --> 01:11:09.820
I don't know. I don't think so. Hang on a second.

1206
01:11:10.810 --> 01:11:15.300
Yeah. Okay. My phone,

1207
01:11:15.301 --> 01:11:18.990
I thought she could come on. Um, she can't, she gotta do mommy duty.

1208
01:11:18.991 --> 01:11:23.490
I got to have a back on more man. Miss having her on here. Um,

1209
01:11:23.710 --> 01:11:28.290
anyways, that c a, that's the podcast for this week. Uh,

1210
01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:32.640
how about those dolphins? Want to know top of the AFC east, you know,

1211
01:11:33.210 --> 01:11:37.080
patriots one in one in second place. Um, it's still early.

1212
01:11:37.081 --> 01:11:41.550
Kansas City looking fucking tough. Uh, what else? Cowboys.

1213
01:11:41.551 --> 01:11:44.670
Defense is interested in shambles. Bright Arts.

1214
01:11:44.730 --> 01:11:47.460
It's called me or texts me all fucking concerned about that,

1215
01:11:47.461 --> 01:11:51.530
but it's still early. It's still fucking early. We'll see what's going on. My,

1216
01:11:51.560 --> 01:11:54.960
my beautiful daughter is crying downstairs, so I'm going to go handle that shit.

1217
01:11:55.860 --> 01:11:58.620
And uh, literally and figuratively, God knows

1218
01:12:00.420 --> 01:12:03.690
that's it. And I'll check in on you on Thursday.

1219
01:12:03.691 --> 01:12:07.800
A joy the Monday night football game tonight. And once again,

1220
01:12:07.801 --> 01:12:10.790
congratulations to the Cleveland Indians 22 in a row. I've now, you know,

1221
01:12:10.830 --> 01:12:14.430
obviously never saw that ever. That's in fucking incredible. That's almost,

1222
01:12:14.431 --> 01:12:17.370
I thought it's almost one in a month's worth of games. Yeah. Built,

1223
01:12:17.520 --> 01:12:20.100
there's 30 days in a month and they almost play every day. Yeah. Thank you,

1224
01:12:20.101 --> 01:12:22.290
Bill. All right. Go fuck yourselves. We'll talk to you on Thursday.
