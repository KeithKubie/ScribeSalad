00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.488
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:07.430
SISSIE HSIAO: Hello, everyone.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.040
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:09.860
Well, hi.

00:00:09.860 --> 00:00:12.120
Nice applause right
before I even get started.

00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:13.350
So good morning.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.040
It's great to be here at
I/O. I'm Sissie Hsiao,

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.500
and I lead Google's mobile app
advertising products at Google.

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.350
And this talk will be about
building a successful app

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:28.190
business with ads.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:30.050
So first off, it's
just incredible

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:31.820
to hear all of the
wonderful things

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:34.560
that you're building
in your mobile apps.

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:36.440
And one of my favorite
apps is the one

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:37.820
that you see on the screen.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.120
It's called Calm, and
it's a relaxation app.

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:43.700
And I first sought this
app out because I certainly

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:46.830
needed more calm in my life.

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.040
And so for many of
us, apps like Calm

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.530
are the very reason
that we find our phones

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:55.730
to be so indispensable.

00:00:55.730 --> 00:00:57.830
Now, for developers
like all of you,

00:00:57.830 --> 00:01:00.680
mobile has democratized
access to billions

00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:02.960
of users like me and you.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:08.720
And according to App Annie,
in 2017 over $86 billion

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.480
will be transacted
in apps alone.

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.980
And this is just
the digital goods.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.190
This does not include real
world goods and services that

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.660
are transacted through apps.

00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.410
So there is an incredible
opportunity for all of you

00:01:21.410 --> 00:01:25.940
to build great services to reach
and touch consumers' lives.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:27.800
Now, at the same
time, because there's

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:31.580
an incredible opportunity,
there's incredible competition.

00:01:31.580 --> 00:01:35.420
There are millions of free apps
vying for users' attention.

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:38.660
So you need to make sure that
your app and your advertising

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:42.200
dollars help your app
stand above the crowd.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.030
On the flip side, if you're
using in-app ads monetization,

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:47.030
well, guess what?

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:49.280
Users' expectation
for user experiences

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:51.260
continues to get
higher and higher,

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.746
because they have so
many wonderful choices.

00:01:53.746 --> 00:01:55.370
So if you're putting
ads into your app,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.740
you need to make sure
that those are really

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:01.040
great and elegant
experiences for users.

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.160
Or another way to say it,
both the app and the ads

00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.090
have to be really,
really seamlessly done.

00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:10.350
And this is where
we want to help.

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.530
We want to help you solve
two fundamental problems

00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:15.290
to building a great,
successful app business.

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:18.680
Number one is, how do
you grow your user base?

00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:21.650
How do you find the right
users, the profitable users,

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.630
that will resonate
with your service

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:26.900
and get excited and subscribe
or pay for the services

00:02:26.900 --> 00:02:28.070
that you're building?

00:02:28.070 --> 00:02:31.160
And number two, how do you
monetize your apps more

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:34.071
effectively with in-app
ads monetization?

00:02:34.071 --> 00:02:35.570
This is what I'm
here to talk about.

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.030
We want to help you build
the tools so that you

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:41.660
can focus on building
amazing apps and the content

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.109
for your users.

00:02:44.109 --> 00:02:45.650
So let's start with
number one, which

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:49.010
is how do you find those most
valuable users, the ones that

00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:50.160
will like your app?

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.510
Now, the good news for all of
you is that billions of users

00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.910
are downloading
billions of apps.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:03.440
Last year alone, Google Play
saw 94 billion app downloads

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:04.380
happen.

00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:06.290
And I've been watching
this year over year.

00:03:06.290 --> 00:03:07.610
This number continues to grow.

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.630
It's just incredible.

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:11.960
But the really hard thing
about finding the right user

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.890
is that there is no typical
profile for a user anymore.

00:03:15.890 --> 00:03:18.120
Let me explain what I mean.

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:21.320
Let's take the very
popular vertical of games.

00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:24.830
Now, contrary to what
many people still believe,

00:03:24.830 --> 00:03:27.890
mobile gamers are
not just young males.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.210
And in fact, men and women play
mobile games about equally.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:36.200
And furthermore, in the US,
females from the age of 10

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.590
all the way to 65, about
65% of that population,

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.300
this huge range of females,
plays mobile games.

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.830
One of my favorite
things to do is

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:47.720
to share my favorite
mobile games

00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:50.120
with my daughter, who's seven.

00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:53.030
So apps are really
transcending boundaries

00:03:53.030 --> 00:03:56.670
and defying our presumptions
of what users really like.

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.980
And this is what makes
app promotion really hard.

00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:03.660
You're fishing for
the right users

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.960
who want to use your services.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:09.780
So to help make user acquisition
easier and more effective

00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:12.810
for you, we built a product
called Universal App

00:04:12.810 --> 00:04:16.380
Campaigns, or UAC.

00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:17.519
Now, what is UAC?

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:20.010
Very simply, it's
an ads product,

00:04:20.010 --> 00:04:22.980
and it helps you find the
right user for your app

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.690
across multiple billion
user surfaces, including

00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:31.590
Google Search, the Google
Play Store, YouTube,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.340
and over three million sites and
apps across the Google Display

00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:36.870
Network.

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.690
But before we talk a lot
more about what UAC does

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:42.840
and how it works, let me share
a few stories about developers

00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:48.370
who are using UAC to accomplish
their business goals.

00:04:48.370 --> 00:04:50.280
Let me start with Kabam.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:52.120
Now, many of you might
know about Kabam.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.810
They're an award winning game
developer in San Francisco.

00:04:55.810 --> 00:04:57.570
And they have some
really amazing titles,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:04:59.790
like Marvel's
Contests of Champions

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:01.890
and The Fast and the Furious.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:05.640
And Kabam came to us with a
problem for their business.

00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.790
They wanted to grow their global
daily active users for the game

00:05:09.790 --> 00:05:11.970
Marvel's Contest of Champions.

00:05:11.970 --> 00:05:15.432
Let's hear a little bit more
from them about their story.

00:05:15.432 --> 00:05:19.160
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:22.230
- Kabam is a world leader of
massive multiplayer mobile

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:22.801
games.

00:05:22.801 --> 00:05:25.050
Marvel Contest of Champions
is an action fighting game

00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.870
that released in 2014,
and users can play

00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:30.020
with anyone else in the world.

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:31.950
Because Marvel is
a very social game,

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.680
it's important that we find
players all over the globe.

00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.560
Our target audience are engaged
daily active users, or what we

00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.630
like to call them are regulars.

00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:42.150
These regulars are hard to
find, because they're not bound

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:45.372
by geography, gender, or age.

00:05:45.372 --> 00:05:46.830
We really didn't
have the resources

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.050
to process and analyze
millions of data points

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:50.670
to find our target gamer.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.290
From Hong Kong to
Dallas, each player

00:05:52.290 --> 00:05:54.972
has their own unique
gamer profile.

00:05:54.972 --> 00:05:56.430
At the end of the
day, we just want

00:05:56.430 --> 00:05:57.971
to reach more people
in the world who

00:05:57.971 --> 00:05:59.557
are going to become regulars.

00:05:59.557 --> 00:06:01.140
We worked with the
Google account team

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:02.640
to create a bit
strategy that would

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.940
find the regulars who would want
to play Contest of Champions.

00:06:05.940 --> 00:06:08.760
Google's automation helped us
find a huge untapped audience

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:11.010
that we didn't know existed.

00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:13.950
Considering our game is three
years old with a high user

00:06:13.950 --> 00:06:17.080
base, that really isn't
an easy thing to do.

00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:19.580
We reached hundreds of
thousands of new players.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:21.520
Year over year install
volume increased

00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:24.510
by two and a half times,
with our target return on ad

00:06:24.510 --> 00:06:28.490
spend increasing by 70%.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:31.820
Now we've been able to focus
on our overall growth strategy

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:36.334
rather than worrying about
manually optimizing campaigns.

00:06:36.334 --> 00:06:38.278
[END PLAYBACK]

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.310
SISSIE HSIAO: It's
been really incredible

00:06:44.310 --> 00:06:47.610
for us to be part of
Kabam's success story.

00:06:47.610 --> 00:06:50.460
And we're glad that despite
Marvel's Contest of Champions

00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:53.370
being a game that's
been out since 2014

00:06:53.370 --> 00:06:55.890
and already having
millions of users

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:59.010
that we were able to help
them grow their installs

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.430
by 6x quarter over quarter.

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.530
And maybe more
importantly, their ROAS,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:09.180
or Return On Ad Spend,
increased by 70%.

00:07:09.180 --> 00:07:13.830
So let's look at another
example, this time in Europe.

00:07:13.830 --> 00:07:17.540
Now, mytaxi is Europe's
leading taxi app,

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.110
and it really helps consumers
book and find taxi rides.

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:25.350
Now, you can imagine that
this on demand ride business

00:07:25.350 --> 00:07:26.640
is very competitive.

00:07:26.640 --> 00:07:28.830
It certainly is
competitive in the US,

00:07:28.830 --> 00:07:31.840
and it's competitive
in Europe as well.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.590
So their main business challenge
that they came to us with was,

00:07:34.590 --> 00:07:37.350
how can I find more
users for my taxi app

00:07:37.350 --> 00:07:40.410
that will actually take rides,
and after that first ride,

00:07:40.410 --> 00:07:42.000
continue to take more rides?

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.760
They just wanted those
people to have the frequency

00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:47.200
of use of their service.

00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:50.990
So in September, they
came to us and tried

00:07:50.990 --> 00:07:57.080
UAC for their expansion
into 11 markets in Germany.

00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.030
And within just a
few months, they

00:07:59.030 --> 00:08:02.330
were able to increase their
installs in these 11 test

00:08:02.330 --> 00:08:05.490
markets by 70%.

00:08:05.490 --> 00:08:08.240
And more importantly, they've
tripled their growth rate

00:08:08.240 --> 00:08:11.000
of finding those first
time riders, riders

00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.380
who are new to their service.

00:08:13.380 --> 00:08:15.770
So we're also incredibly
happy that mytaxi

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:19.640
was able to use our tools
to build their business.

00:08:19.640 --> 00:08:21.980
Now, you might
wonder, how is UAC

00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:24.410
able to deliver
these performance

00:08:24.410 --> 00:08:27.270
characteristics for two
very different businesses?

00:08:27.270 --> 00:08:30.440
One is a game expanding
a mature business.

00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:35.900
One is conquesting into a
new region for a taxi app.

00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:39.080
Well, the secret sauce is
not really that secret.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:40.940
It's machine learning.

00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:44.330
And UAC uses machine
learning to learn

00:08:44.330 --> 00:08:47.210
which app users are the
most relevant and right

00:08:47.210 --> 00:08:48.680
for your app.

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.300
And it does this by
combining, in real time,

00:08:51.300 --> 00:08:54.020
hundreds of millions
of signal combinations

00:08:54.020 --> 00:08:57.200
to understand where
the ad should show,

00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:00.470
who the ad should show to,
what the ad should look like,

00:09:00.470 --> 00:09:03.500
and also what to
pay for that ad.

00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.930
And it's doing all of this
optimization in real time

00:09:05.930 --> 00:09:08.570
to optimize the
value of your dollars

00:09:08.570 --> 00:09:11.720
so that we return the highest
ROI for your advertising

00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:13.400
budgets.

00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:16.940
And this helps you to
save both time and money

00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.860
for your acquisition campaigns.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:23.980
Because of this,
I'm also incredibly

00:09:23.980 --> 00:09:26.200
proud to say that we
have now delivered

00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:30.400
over 10 billion installs
for developers like you

00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.440
through our ad services.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:34.300
And potentially
even more important,

00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.640
we're delivering
over seven billion

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:38.810
in app events per quarter.

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:39.920
What are in-app events?

00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:42.200
These are the events
that matter to your app,

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:44.020
whether it's subscribing
to the service

00:09:44.020 --> 00:09:47.830
or passing a level in a game
or taking a ride in your ride

00:09:47.830 --> 00:09:49.602
sharing app.

00:09:49.602 --> 00:09:50.560
But this is not enough.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:53.170
I'd like to share some new
announcements on what we're

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:56.980
adding to universal campaigns.

00:09:56.980 --> 00:10:00.580
The first thing is we know that
a really good way for users

00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.080
to understand what
your app is about

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:04.760
is to show them a
video of the app.

00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.910
And this is why
earlier this year, we

00:10:06.910 --> 00:10:10.420
introduced a new feature,
a click-to-play video

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:13.240
ad in Google Play.

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.700
Now, this unit is
exactly like it says.

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.430
Users go to the Google Play
store looking for some app

00:10:18.430 --> 00:10:19.210
to download.

00:10:19.210 --> 00:10:23.420
They're invited to watch a video
about an app they might like.

00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:24.910
And after watching
that video, they

00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.210
can decide whether they want
to download the app or not.

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:32.870
This leads to very qualified
users for that advertiser.

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:38.260
Sorry.

00:10:41.210 --> 00:10:43.640
Now, another way to
qualify high value users

00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.540
is to actually let them try
the app before they install it.

00:10:47.540 --> 00:10:49.040
And I'm sure many
of you have heard

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:52.700
of this new technology called
Google Play Instant, which

00:10:52.700 --> 00:10:53.660
is really cool.

00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:55.920
Basically, if you haven't
heard about this technology,

00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:59.810
it allows you to build a
small version of your game

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.800
and have it load instantly
for consumers to try.

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:06.560
Now, how does this work with
Universal App Campaigns?

00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:07.880
Very simply.

00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:11.870
We are going to show users
a Try Now button in the app

00:11:11.870 --> 00:11:13.850
install ads that they encounter.

00:11:13.850 --> 00:11:16.190
So if you're using
Google Play Instant,

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.380
you plug it into
Universal App Campaigns,

00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:20.660
and now users get a
try now experience

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:22.670
where they get to
experience, potentially,

00:11:22.670 --> 00:11:25.990
a level of your game before
deciding to download.

00:11:25.990 --> 00:11:28.299
And this is something we're
actively experimenting with

00:11:28.299 --> 00:11:29.840
and will launch in
the coming months.

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:41.300
However, making ads informative
and engaging isn't enough.

00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:44.800
We also want to make them
super relevant for users.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:48.430
About 70% of users say that
they download an app based on

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:51.050
whether they think they're
going to use it or not,

00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:53.920
which seems pretty
intuitive to me.

00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:56.260
And so to help provide
more information

00:11:56.260 --> 00:11:59.230
about your app in
your install ads,

00:11:59.230 --> 00:12:01.540
we're introducing a new
feature, the ability

00:12:01.540 --> 00:12:05.650
to surface in-app content in
your Universal App Campaigns

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.580
ads.

00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:09.700
Now, maybe an example is
more clear on explaining

00:12:09.700 --> 00:12:12.140
how this works.

00:12:12.140 --> 00:12:14.590
So let's look at the app Wish.

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:16.510
For those of you who
don't have the Wish app,

00:12:16.510 --> 00:12:17.920
Wish is a retail app.

00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.640
And they sell a lot
of different things.

00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:23.080
They sell kid stuff, they
sell sports equipment,

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.240
they sell travel
stuff, they sell a lot

00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:27.730
of different lines of products.

00:12:27.730 --> 00:12:29.740
And so what Wish
can do now is they

00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:34.000
can feed that list of
products to AdWords.

00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.090
And after they've connected
that to Universal App Campaigns,

00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:39.640
we will now use machine
learning to figure out

00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:43.090
which products to service
to which users before they

00:12:43.090 --> 00:12:44.390
download the app.

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:48.880
So for example, some users might
want to be buying kid's stuff,

00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:49.972
because they're parents.

00:12:49.972 --> 00:12:52.180
This is something that the
machine learning algorithm

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:53.650
will optimize towards.

00:12:53.650 --> 00:12:56.740
Or another set of users might be
interested in sports equipment.

00:12:56.740 --> 00:12:58.510
That's what they'll
optimize towards.

00:12:58.510 --> 00:13:00.220
So this is just
another way for us

00:13:00.220 --> 00:13:04.390
to surface more information
about what your app is

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.010
for your potential users.

00:13:08.802 --> 00:13:10.760
Now let's switch gears
and talk about something

00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:13.730
really important, which is
the measurement of your app

00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:14.930
install ads.

00:13:14.930 --> 00:13:17.270
I know a lot of you
care about understanding

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:20.180
the ROI and efficiency
of those ads dollars

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.840
that you're putting forth.

00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.960
So we're announcing
a new metric called

00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:27.230
View Through Conversions,
or VTCs, for Universal App

00:13:27.230 --> 00:13:28.520
Campaigns.

00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:33.950
Very simply, this metric just
correlates your impressions

00:13:33.950 --> 00:13:37.550
on video and display
ads to the app installs

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:39.067
that happen downstream.

00:13:39.067 --> 00:13:41.150
And this is something that
will surface in AdWords

00:13:41.150 --> 00:13:44.250
in the coming months.

00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:47.210
Now, developers like InnoGames,
which created Forge of Empires,

00:13:47.210 --> 00:13:49.850
have been using
VTCs to understand

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:52.910
how effective their
Universal App Campaigns are.

00:13:52.910 --> 00:13:56.570
And this is also a great way
to compare VTCs between Google

00:13:56.570 --> 00:13:59.610
and other acquisition channels.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:01.580
Now, the other thing I'd
like to add about VTCs

00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:04.880
is that they will be surfaced
in both AdWords and our app

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:07.730
attribution partners, because
we know that many of you

00:14:07.730 --> 00:14:10.790
are using those surfaces
to compare metrics

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:12.270
between different providers.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.350
So we're really excited
about the huge opportunity

00:14:18.350 --> 00:14:21.320
that you have to
build a great service

00:14:21.320 --> 00:14:25.250
and get that service into the
hands of billions of users.

00:14:25.250 --> 00:14:26.990
And my team is
excited to continue

00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:28.970
working on Universal
App Campaigns

00:14:28.970 --> 00:14:31.670
to help you achieve your
user acquisition goals.

00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.330
And now, the flip side
of building a successful

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.780
apps business, which
is monetization.

00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:42.710
I'd like to share
with you how Google

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:46.550
is helping you build great
monetization into your app

00:14:46.550 --> 00:14:50.340
through advertising.

00:14:50.340 --> 00:14:53.350
Now, getting ads into
your app may seem easy,

00:14:53.350 --> 00:14:56.980
but it's actually not that
obvious, and here's why.

00:14:56.980 --> 00:14:59.010
Number one is what I
talked about earlier.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:02.400
Users have a really high
expectation for the apps

00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:03.400
that they use.

00:15:03.400 --> 00:15:05.640
So if you're putting
ads in, they better

00:15:05.640 --> 00:15:07.510
be working really well.

00:15:07.510 --> 00:15:09.960
And number two is
fine, I'm opted

00:15:09.960 --> 00:15:11.850
in to showing ads to users.

00:15:11.850 --> 00:15:15.180
How exactly do I make the
most from my ad partners?

00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:16.930
How do I maximize revenue?

00:15:16.930 --> 00:15:19.500
Those are the two problems
that we want to help you with.

00:15:19.500 --> 00:15:22.440
Let's start with
great ads experiences.

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:24.660
Now, stepping back
for a second, I've

00:15:24.660 --> 00:15:27.210
been working on apps
for six, seven years,

00:15:27.210 --> 00:15:28.950
and I've been really,
really interested

00:15:28.950 --> 00:15:31.200
with the emergence of
so many different ways

00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.240
that users can pay for things.

00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:35.110
They can pay through
subscriptions.

00:15:35.110 --> 00:15:36.900
They can pay through
in-app purchases.

00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:39.120
They can pay through
virtual currencies.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:41.400
And now there's other
things like tipping.

00:15:41.400 --> 00:15:42.960
There's just so
many different ways

00:15:42.960 --> 00:15:46.380
that monetization is
emerging in the apps surface.

00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:48.990
And one thing that we've
seen become very popular

00:15:48.990 --> 00:15:52.560
recently is hybrid
monetization, which

00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.380
is just a fancy way of
saying in-app purchases

00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:57.180
and ads in the same app.

00:15:59.730 --> 00:16:02.010
And when app developers
are doing this,

00:16:02.010 --> 00:16:04.140
one thing that's become
very popular recently

00:16:04.140 --> 00:16:06.240
is something called
rewarded ads.

00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:08.490
For those of you who don't
know what rewarded ads are,

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:12.510
very simply, users opt
into watching an ad,

00:16:12.510 --> 00:16:16.760
and in return, they get
a service in the app.

00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.510
Now, this is very,
very popular in games,

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:21.930
but I'll share a non-game
example, Pandora.

00:16:21.930 --> 00:16:24.540
Pandora realized
that many users who

00:16:24.540 --> 00:16:26.820
were using their
music service were not

00:16:26.820 --> 00:16:29.250
going to become subscribers.

00:16:29.250 --> 00:16:31.820
So instead they offered
those users a choice.

00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:35.160
Would you like to watch
an ad and in return get

00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:37.380
some ad free listening?

00:16:37.380 --> 00:16:40.020
And by and large, this is
an incredibly great model,

00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:44.190
because Pandora gets to monetize
those users who are not paying,

00:16:44.190 --> 00:16:47.220
and the user gets a service,
they're happy with it,

00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:51.810
and the advertiser actually gets
a very engaged and qualified

00:16:51.810 --> 00:16:55.070
view from that user.

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:58.600
So let's take a look at a
second example, Avid.ly,

00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:01.810
which is a creator of a
game called Bingo Party.

00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:06.328
Now, Avid.ly was very concerned
about adding ads to their app.

00:17:06.328 --> 00:17:07.869
They were worried
that ads were going

00:17:07.869 --> 00:17:10.660
to ruin the gameplay
experience, that users

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.450
would flee to other free games.

00:17:13.450 --> 00:17:15.369
So they decided to
try rewarded ads,

00:17:15.369 --> 00:17:17.170
just to see how it would work.

00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:21.760
And the surprising results are,
number one, they made more.

00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.970
They got an increase in revenue
between IAP and ads by 40%.

00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.520
But in addition,
session duration

00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:34.900
grew by 20%, which means that
by adding these ads to the game,

00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:38.200
users actually paid
more and played longer.

00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:40.000
So everybody wins, right?

00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.340
Avid.ly, Pandora are
showcasing that when

00:17:42.340 --> 00:17:46.000
you put the ads into the app
in an elegant way, users,

00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.080
publishers, advertisers
are all going to win.

00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.880
And because this model
has become very popular,

00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:56.530
it's no surprise that we have
seen rewarded ads in AdMob

00:17:56.530 --> 00:18:02.050
grow by 9x since we introduced
it in March of last year.

00:18:02.050 --> 00:18:05.134
And we've added a lot more
to rewarded ads since then.

00:18:05.134 --> 00:18:06.550
One of the things
that we've added

00:18:06.550 --> 00:18:08.590
is rewarded with
multiple options.

00:18:08.590 --> 00:18:11.320
And that's what you see
on this screen here.

00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:13.690
Essentially, users are
deciding to watch an ad

00:18:13.690 --> 00:18:16.870
to get some item or
service in the app.

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:19.900
Why don't you let them pick
which ad they want to watch?

00:18:19.900 --> 00:18:22.360
This leads, again, to the
user being more interested

00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.490
in the ad that they've
decided to watch,

00:18:24.490 --> 00:18:28.960
and also the advertisers getting
a much more qualified user.

00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:34.925
This also then leads to higher
CPMs for you as a developer.

00:18:34.925 --> 00:18:37.050
Now, one of the new things
I'd like to share today,

00:18:37.050 --> 00:18:40.950
I'm really excited about, is
rewarded reporting in AdMob.

00:18:40.950 --> 00:18:44.430
Now, this may not sound like,
wow, what's going on here?

00:18:44.430 --> 00:18:46.270
Reported reporting
is super important,

00:18:46.270 --> 00:18:49.050
because you need to know
how rewarded actually

00:18:49.050 --> 00:18:51.160
works in your app.

00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:53.340
So here we're going to
share a lot more metrics

00:18:53.340 --> 00:18:56.220
about exactly what's going
on with the users that

00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.980
are interacting with
your rewarded ads, which

00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:02.940
rewarded ads are working and
not, what reward units are more

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.550
resonating with users, what
are the view through rates

00:19:05.550 --> 00:19:06.730
of reward ads.

00:19:06.730 --> 00:19:09.190
And this lets you
as a developer tune

00:19:09.190 --> 00:19:13.230
and optimize how and where you
offer these rewards and also

00:19:13.230 --> 00:19:15.419
what reward to provide to users.

00:19:15.419 --> 00:19:17.460
This also gives you a
sense of how it's affecting

00:19:17.460 --> 00:19:19.260
your core user experience.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:22.320
Is it additive, like the
case we saw with Avid.ly?

00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.510
And how is it
affecting your RPU?

00:19:24.510 --> 00:19:27.090
So this is going to be
available in AdMob very soon.

00:19:30.460 --> 00:19:33.952
Now, I just talked about
great ads experiences in apps.

00:19:33.952 --> 00:19:36.410
Let me talk about something
else which is really important,

00:19:36.410 --> 00:19:38.600
which is maximizing
the revenue that you're

00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.310
getting from your ad partners.

00:19:42.310 --> 00:19:44.520
So typically the
way this works today

00:19:44.520 --> 00:19:46.530
is something called mediation.

00:19:46.530 --> 00:19:49.350
And very simply,
this is the ordering

00:19:49.350 --> 00:19:53.010
of how you sell your ads
to different ad partners.

00:19:53.010 --> 00:19:56.460
Now, mediation traditionally
works on a historical pricing

00:19:56.460 --> 00:20:00.150
basis, which basically means,
in this mock up you see here,

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:03.540
Network A paid $2 in the
past, so they're at the top.

00:20:03.540 --> 00:20:05.550
And Network B and
Network C are below that,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:08.760
because historically
their prices were lower.

00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:11.040
Now, the flaw with this
model, as you can see,

00:20:11.040 --> 00:20:14.340
is that at any given
moment, each impression

00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:15.750
can be priced differently.

00:20:15.750 --> 00:20:17.700
And in fact,
Network B or C might

00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:20.130
have a higher price
for an impression

00:20:20.130 --> 00:20:22.270
than Network A at any time.

00:20:24.910 --> 00:20:26.220
So we think we can help.

00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:30.420
Earlier this year, we announced
a feature called Open Bidding.

00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:33.960
Now, what Open Bidding does is
it takes mediation and instead

00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.140
moves it to a real time
bidded auction system.

00:20:38.140 --> 00:20:39.000
What does that mean?

00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:43.230
Very simply, every impression is
available for every ad network

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:46.870
to bid into simultaneously
and in real time.

00:20:46.870 --> 00:20:49.050
And this means a
higher and better price

00:20:49.050 --> 00:20:51.300
for each and every
impression for those of you

00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:55.350
who are selling ads
inventory in your apps.

00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:58.260
Now, the benefits are
beyond pricing as well.

00:20:58.260 --> 00:21:01.560
Mediation typically requires
integration of multiple ad

00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:05.730
network SDKs, as well as
launching multiple surfaces

00:21:05.730 --> 00:21:08.385
to reconcile billing and
figuring out payments.

00:21:10.900 --> 00:21:13.420
With Open Bidding, we're
trying to resolve all that.

00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.640
You can get most of the
[INAUDIBLE] benefits from all

00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:19.630
of those ad providers
through a single AdMob SDK,

00:21:19.630 --> 00:21:22.520
leading to a lighter app
for your users to download,

00:21:22.520 --> 00:21:25.330
and also less development time.

00:21:25.330 --> 00:21:27.490
And what's more,
AdMob will often

00:21:27.490 --> 00:21:30.310
manage the billing to
and provide transparency

00:21:30.310 --> 00:21:31.670
into your metrics.

00:21:31.670 --> 00:21:34.060
So you don't have to
chase down payments or log

00:21:34.060 --> 00:21:35.360
into multiple interfaces.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:42.220
Now, developers like Ilyon here
are seeing remarkable results

00:21:42.220 --> 00:21:43.947
by being part of our
Open Bidding beta.

00:21:43.947 --> 00:21:46.030
And this is something that
we're going to continue

00:21:46.030 --> 00:21:49.720
expanding over time.

00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.360
In fact, in addition
to the partners

00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:53.220
that we launched
earlier this year,

00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.520
we have now added the
global ad network InMobi

00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.320
to our Open Bidding feature.

00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:04.630
Now, let's talk about a second
way for maximizing revenue

00:22:04.630 --> 00:22:08.290
from your ad partners, something
called open measurement.

00:22:08.290 --> 00:22:11.530
And very, very simply,
brand advertisers

00:22:11.530 --> 00:22:14.020
are often buying
impressions for users,

00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:16.960
and they want to make sure that
those impressions are seen.

00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:19.360
Hence the viewability part.

00:22:19.360 --> 00:22:21.730
Now, in reality, in
the past, if developers

00:22:21.730 --> 00:22:25.330
wanted to guarantee
viewability of their ads,

00:22:25.330 --> 00:22:27.910
they had to integrate
multiple SDKs that

00:22:27.910 --> 00:22:31.420
yielded disparate numbers
of their viewability.

00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:33.370
So to solve that,
what we've done

00:22:33.370 --> 00:22:36.100
is joined an IAB
led coalition, which

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.910
is unifying and simplifying
down to a single methodology

00:22:39.910 --> 00:22:43.840
for measuring
viewability in your ads.

00:22:43.840 --> 00:22:47.140
So we're excited to announce
that we have integrated the IAB

00:22:47.140 --> 00:22:51.730
Open Measurement SDK into
our Google Mobile Ads GMA

00:22:51.730 --> 00:22:56.120
and our Interactive
Media Ads IMA SDKs.

00:22:56.120 --> 00:22:59.320
So this solution will help you
save time as well as reflect

00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:02.290
the true value of
your app inventory.

00:23:02.290 --> 00:23:06.550
Now in addition, our
developers on DoubleClick,

00:23:06.550 --> 00:23:09.820
both our DFP and our
ad exchange products,

00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:12.800
will also be able
to use this beta.

00:23:16.220 --> 00:23:17.450
So thank you so much.

00:23:17.450 --> 00:23:18.840
We've covered a ton today.

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:21.290
So if you have any questions
about both user acquisition

00:23:21.290 --> 00:23:25.070
and Universal App Campaigns
or our AdMob announcements,

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.540
please come to our office hours.

00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:30.880
So I'd just like
to close by saying,

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:34.480
it is an incredible
time to be a developer.

00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:38.260
You can build great services
to reach billions of users,

00:23:38.260 --> 00:23:41.290
and our job is to help you build
a great business foundation

00:23:41.290 --> 00:23:43.190
on top of those services.

00:23:43.190 --> 00:23:45.100
We want to help you
with two problems.

00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.190
User acquisition, finding
the right uses for your app.

00:23:48.190 --> 00:23:51.040
And number two, in-app
ads monetization.

00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:54.490
Continue to make more
and maximize your revenue

00:23:54.490 --> 00:23:58.030
from the ads that you're
adding to your app.

00:23:58.030 --> 00:24:00.280
Thank you so much
for all of your time,

00:24:00.280 --> 00:24:03.358
and enjoy the rest
of your time at I/O.

00:24:03.358 --> 00:24:06.990
