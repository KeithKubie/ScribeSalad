00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:30.570
Prior to 

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:41.239
the 1940s, the word “nacho” had two meanings-
one was a Tex-Mex slang word combining “naturally”

00:00:41.239 --> 00:00:43.219
and “of course” into “nacho.”

00:00:43.219 --> 00:00:47.570
The other was a common nickname for a small
boy whose name was “Ignacio”- basically

00:00:47.570 --> 00:00:52.670
the Mexican equivalent of calling a boy named
William “Billy” or Timothy “Timmy.”

00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.829
Discovery of this latter fact led Adriana
Orr from the Oxford English Dictionary in

00:00:56.829 --> 00:01:00.339
a search to see if there was an Ignacio behind
nachos.

00:01:00.339 --> 00:01:05.580
What she ultimately found was a man named
Ignacio Anaya Sr. who, while he probably wasn’t

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:10.470
the first person to ever decide to mix tortilla
chips with melted cheese and jalapenos, does

00:01:10.470 --> 00:01:15.190
seem to be the person directly responsible
for nachos becoming a thing, along with lending

00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:16.860
his name to the food item.

00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:22.020
The “nacho” story begins in the early
1940s in the town of Piedras Negras, Mexico,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.110
which is only four miles from the American
border and near Eagle Pass, Texas.

00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:31.410
That was the site of historic Fort Duncan,
which during World War II was used as a support

00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:34.640
facility for the nearby Eagle Pass Army Airfield.

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:37.950
With the border only a few miles away, many
who were stationed in the region often traveled

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:40.470
into Mexico for a better bite to eat.

00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.910
This is where details of this legend get deliciously
murky.

00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.170
To wit- in Piedras Negras a favorite restaurant
of the border crossing Americans was the patriotically

00:01:49.170 --> 00:01:54.010
named Victory Club, then owned by one Rudolfo
de Los Santos.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:57.560
Another such restaurant in the town was the
Old Moderno Restaurant.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.370
Both establishments featured a common worker
– the aforementioned Ignacio Anaya Sr.,

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:05.890
who was more affectionately known as “Nacho”
Anaya.

00:02:05.890 --> 00:02:10.509
Stories are mixed (including ones featuring
interviews with Anaya Sr. himself) as to which

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:14.159
he was working at when he first whipped up
the appetizer that would come to bear his

00:02:14.159 --> 00:02:15.159
name.

00:02:15.159 --> 00:02:16.159
Wherever he was when he first made it, after
their advent, he made sure they were served

00:02:16.159 --> 00:02:17.159
at both restaurants.

00:02:17.159 --> 00:02:18.620
While there are various tellings of the tale,
according to an article by Clarence J. La

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:24.370
Roche published on May 23, 1954 in the San
Antonio Express titled “Nacho’s?

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.510
Natch!”- the first known account of the
origin of nachos- Ignacio himself told La

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:33.470
Roche that one night a group of customers
(often variously claimed to have been soldiers

00:02:33.470 --> 00:02:38.150
or soldiers’ wives), tired of the normal
fare, came in asking for something completely

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.150
new.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:40.920
La Roche then stated Ignacio told him,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.060
Honestly, I didn’t have the least idea what
I was going to try.

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.480
But, I went into the kitchen, looked around
and started groping for an idea.

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:52.420
I saw a bowl of freshly fried pieces of tortilla;
then I figured some grated cheese on them

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:53.420
might be all right.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.749
Well, I got the cheese and began sprinkling
the tortilla pieces with it.

00:02:56.749 --> 00:03:00.060
About this time, I got the idea to put some
jalapeno strips atop the cheese.

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.659
I got the jalapeno; and as I finished putting
the strips on the cheese, I decided it would

00:03:03.659 --> 00:03:06.810
be a good idea to put the whole thing into
the oven to melt the cheese.

00:03:06.810 --> 00:03:11.310
(In a 1969 interview appearing in the San
Antonio Express and News, he would further

00:03:11.310 --> 00:03:15.880
state that his recipe for nachos was mostly
just a variation on quesadillas his foster

00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:17.700
mother used to make him as a child.)

00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:22.510
When the customers asked what the dish was
called, he told them “Nacho’s Especiales.”

00:03:22.510 --> 00:03:26.659
Within days patrons were clamoring for “Nacho’s
Special” and Anaya was teaching other workers

00:03:26.659 --> 00:03:28.129
at the pair of restaurants he worked at to
make them.

00:03:28.129 --> 00:03:32.520
He also soon began experimenting with variations
on the original, such as including refried

00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:34.290
beans and guacamole.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:38.870
It should be noted here that the original
date of these first nachos is disputed- it

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:43.770
was claimed both in the aforementioned 1954
San Antonio Express interview as well as in

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.260
a Corpus Christi Times interview in 1974 that
Ignacio said he first whipped them up in 1940.

00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:53.999
But in both cases this wasn’t a direct quote
from him, just these articles claiming he

00:03:53.999 --> 00:03:54.999
said that.

00:03:54.999 --> 00:03:58.769
If this is true, it would call into question
the commonly stated “soldier” or “soldiers’

00:03:58.769 --> 00:04:04.189
wives” angle as Fort Duncan wasn’t made
into a military base in WWII until 1942 and

00:04:04.189 --> 00:04:07.930
Eagle Pass Army Airfield not activated until
that same year.

00:04:07.930 --> 00:04:14.290
However most sources, including Ignacio Jr.,
state the correct year was actually 1943.

00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:18.709
Whatever the case, during the 1940s the appetizer
began to spread along Texas/Mexico border

00:04:18.709 --> 00:04:23.940
towns under the name “Nachos Especiales,”
with one of the first known documented instance

00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:28.310
of this occurring in 1949 in A Taste of Texas,
by Jane Trahey,

00:04:28.310 --> 00:04:32.819
There’s a little restaurant in the small
Mexican town of Villa Acuna that serves some

00:04:32.819 --> 00:04:35.000
of the finest food in the world.

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.449
For part of World War II, Mr. Julian Cross,
managing editor of the San Antonio Express,

00:04:39.449 --> 00:04:41.690
was stationed on the Rio Grande border.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.260
One night a small group of officers, one terribly
homesick, decided to visit Pedro, their favorite

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:47.260
waiter there.

00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:49.640
Like all Latins, Pedro just couldn’t stand
unhappiness.

00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:53.440
He did everything but stand on his head to
cheer his morose uniformed guest.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:56.460
When nothing, including the Martinis, worked,
Pedro left.

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.710
Sometime later he returned carrying a large
dish of Nachos Especiales.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:04.620
“These Nachos,” said Pedro, “will help
El Capitan—soon he will forget his troubles

00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.569
for nachos make one romantic.”

00:05:06.569 --> 00:05:08.770
It goes on to give the recipe as:

00:05:08.770 --> 00:05:09.930
1 pkg.

00:05:09.930 --> 00:05:12.030
Mexican tortillas
A small hunk of American cheese

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.370
A bottle or can of pickled peppers (preferably
jalapenos)

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:19.960
Cut tortillas into small triangular pieces,
place in a pan and put into a medium hot oven

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:20.979
to toast.

00:05:20.979 --> 00:05:25.580
Remove from the oven when barely crisp, put
a small piece of cheese on each piece of tortilla.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:29.919
Replace in the oven until the cheese is melted;
remove from oven and garnish each piece with

00:05:29.919 --> 00:05:32.909
a small slice of pickled pepper and serve.

00:05:32.909 --> 00:05:37.229
A year before this, “nachos” appeared
in the San Antonio Light in an advertisement

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:39.280
for the Latin Quarter Mexican Restaurant:

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:43.349
“NACHOS” (Mexican Hors-D’-Oeuvres)…35c
Here is a real dainty!

00:05:43.349 --> 00:05:47.639
Golden fried tortilla strips, deliciously
spiced, topped with mellow, melted cheese

00:05:47.639 --> 00:05:50.319
and garnished with chili jalapeno bits.

00:05:50.319 --> 00:05:54.360
As for Anaya Sr. himself, he would go on to
open his own restaurant, Nacho’s Restaurant,

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.439
in Piedras Negras where Nacho’s Especiales
were featured on the menu.

00:05:58.439 --> 00:06:03.470
By 1959, nachos would make the jump to the
west coast thanks to a young woman named Carmen

00:06:03.470 --> 00:06:07.139
Rocha who moved from San Antonio to L.A. with
her husband.

00:06:07.139 --> 00:06:11.580
Since San Antonio is less than a three-hour
drive from Piedras Negras, she had grown up

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.759
with nachos.

00:06:12.759 --> 00:06:17.720
When Rocha got a job serving at El Cholo Mexican
Restaurant on Los Angeles’ Western Avenue,

00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:22.240
she told the chef’s about the easy and quick
to make tasty snack she used to eat as a teen

00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:23.270
called nachos.

00:06:23.270 --> 00:06:28.139
Decades later, El Cholo had become an L.A.
institution, thanks in large part to Rocha

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.259
and her nachos.

00:06:29.259 --> 00:06:34.409
When she died in 2008, even El Cholo regular
Jack Nicholson grieved, telling the LA Times,

00:06:34.409 --> 00:06:36.520
“Carmen was wonderful, to me and to everybody…

00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:38.810
It’s a community loss.”

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:43.050
While Rocha’s introduction of nachos to
the west coast surely contributed to its popularization,

00:06:43.050 --> 00:06:50.310
there’s no bigger influence on how nachos
are consumed today than Frank Liberto, “The

00:06:50.310 --> 00:06:51.310
Father of Nachos”.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.469
He’s the man who introduced so-called “fast
food” or “stadium” nachos- the ones

00:06:55.469 --> 00:07:00.129
with the gooey, yellow “cheese”- to sports
stadiums and movie theaters.

00:07:00.129 --> 00:07:04.409
With his family originally hailing from Sicily,
Liberto took over the San Antonio-based family

00:07:04.409 --> 00:07:07.879
food business from his father “Rico” Liberto
selling concessions.

00:07:07.879 --> 00:07:11.850
In fact, the company was perhaps the first
American concession-focused business, even

00:07:11.850 --> 00:07:14.750
pioneering the selling of peanuts at the circus.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.720
As for the tale of the evolution and popularization
of nachos, at a Texas Rangers baseball game

00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:25.080
in Arlington in 1976, Liberto’s company
“Rico’s” sold the very first “stadium

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:28.500
nachos” featuring a jalapeno cheese sauce
Liberto had come up with.

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:32.449
The advantage here over melting grated cheese
on the chips was that the gooey “cheese”

00:07:32.449 --> 00:07:35.969
sauce could be ladled up quickly and had a
long shelf life.

00:07:35.969 --> 00:07:40.490
Despite the sauce not actually being cheese
(this according to the FDA), it was an immediate

00:07:40.490 --> 00:07:44.000
hit and outsold every other food item at the
stadium in 1976.

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:49.110
Even better for concessions business was that
nacho sales also resulted in a large spike

00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:53.610
in beverage purchases, as you might expect
from people consuming a sauce with jalapeno

00:07:53.610 --> 00:07:56.789
juice in it.

00:07:56.789 --> 00:08:00.449
Just as importantly, the introduction of nachos
didn’t seem to negatively impact things

00:08:00.449 --> 00:08:02.419
like hot dog and popcorn sales.

00:08:02.419 --> 00:08:07.159
(This latter potential issue was a big concern
Liberto frequently heard when first pitching

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:08.780
his nachos to various event groups.)

00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:12.800
Within a year of this, with an eye on moving
more into the lucrative movie theater concessions

00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.710
industry, Liberto purchased Associated Popcorn,
which was a major supplier to various theaters

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.710
in Texas.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:22.889
This, combined with John Rowley of United
Artist Theatres discovering Liberto’s nachos,

00:08:22.889 --> 00:08:27.530
saw gooey-cheesed nachos hit the concessions
stands in theaters across the state.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:32.240
As for how nachos became more mainstream nation-wide,
this is thanks to their being served at the

00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:34.240
Dallas Cowboys’ Stadium in 1978.

00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:39.409
At the time, the Cowboys were known as “America’s
Team” and often played host to ABC’s Monday

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:40.409
Night Football.

00:08:40.409 --> 00:08:44.120
The announcing team for those games included
the legendary Howard Cosell.

00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.680
The story goes (at least according to Liberto’s
son) that while trying to fill dead air during

00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:52.279
a blowout, Cosell groped around for things
to talk about and remarked on how delicious

00:08:52.279 --> 00:08:55.320
his snack was- these new “nachos.”

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:59.770
Whether that was really his original motivation
or not, Cosell did indeed begin to describe

00:08:59.770 --> 00:09:04.980
plays on-air as a “nacho,” as in “that
was a nacho run” and extolled the virtues

00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:06.440
of the tasty snack frequently.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.660
Not long after this, “stadium nachos”
were in every stadium across the country thanks

00:09:10.660 --> 00:09:13.670
to Cosell’s near constant promotion of the
word – and food – nacho.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:18.060
Unfortunately, “Nacho” Anaya Sr. died
in 1975, so was never able to see a version

00:09:18.060 --> 00:09:22.459
of his culinary invention being talked about
in front of a nationally televised audience,

00:09:22.459 --> 00:09:23.459
nor see it become a hit nation-wide.

00:09:23.459 --> 00:09:27.240
Today, there’s reportedly a bronze plaque
up in Piedras Negras that honors the creator

00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:29.020
of this “Mexican hors d’oeuvre”.

00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:32.399
Additionally, October 21st is considered International
Day of the Nacho.

00:09:32.399 --> 00:09:36.500
No matter the day or the place, however, according
to Anaya’s granddaughter in an interview

00:09:36.500 --> 00:09:41.839
with the San Antonio Express-News in 2002,
nachos today just don’t taste as good as

00:09:41.839 --> 00:09:42.839
the original.

00:09:42.839 --> 00:09:44.140
She states, “The chips are different.

00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:46.420
They’re not homemade chips like he used
to do.

00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:53.410
Or maybe it’s the hands of the chef.”
