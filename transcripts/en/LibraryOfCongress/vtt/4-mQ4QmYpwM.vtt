&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:06.220 --> 00:00:08.820
&gt;&gt; John Kelly: Their new
book is about how a beam

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.160 position:56%
from the World Trade Center was
turned into the bow of a naval ship.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.650
But it's really about more
than that as you'll hear today.

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:22.880
It's a very sensitive book that
in the end is quite inspiring.

00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.210
Janet Nolan lives outside
of Chicago.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:31.350 position:56%
She's the author of five books
including "PB and J Hooray" which is

00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:34.180
about building something
slightly smaller than a ship.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:36.420
A peanut butter and jelly sandwich.

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.600
Thomas Gonzalez was
born in Havana, Cuba,

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:42.950
and now lives outside of Atlanta.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:46.130
He worked for more than 20
years as a design principle

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:50.020 position:56%
and creative development manager at
Coca-Cola and has directed campaigns

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.460
for such clients as Delta
Airlines, Nascar, and McDonald's.

00:00:54.460 --> 00:00:59.990
He has illustrated a number of
books; the first of which sort

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:01.880
of [inaudible] this book.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:06.080
It was called "14 Cows
for America" and it's

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:10.070
about Wilson Kimeli Naiyomah, a
massai from Kenya who had gone

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:15.310
to the United States to study
and was in New York City on 9/11

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:21.370
and he was moved to show his
feelings for his adoptive country

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.030
and he did it by donating cows
blessed by his village elders

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:29.650 position:56%
to the American ambassador to Kenya.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.720
Janet Nolan has written
that it isn't hard for her

00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:36.530
to find interesting
topics to write about.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.060
The hard part she says,
"Is determining

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:42.160
if the topic will make
an interesting book."

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.570
Facts are great but what
matters is the heart

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:48.370
of the story within those facts.

00:01:48.370 --> 00:01:51.310
Our next speakers are very
good at finding that heart

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:52.750
and illustrating those stories.

00:01:52.750 --> 00:01:57.510
So, please join me in welcoming
Janet Nolan and Thomas Gonzalez.

00:01:57.510 --> 00:02:03.170
[ Applause ]

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:06.850
&gt;&gt; Janet Nolan: So, I'm Janet
Nolan and this is our book,

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.610
"Seven and a Half Tons of Steel"
and I'm so happy to be here today

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.130
to talk to you about my new book.

00:02:13.130 --> 00:02:17.000
I'm the author and Thomas
Gonzalez is the illustrator

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.300
and we're both going

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.730
to be discussing how this
book came into being.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:24.870 position:56%
So, "Seven and a Half Tons of
Steel" is a non-fiction picture book

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:29.590
about building a navy ship, the USS
New York whose bow contains seven

00:02:29.590 --> 00:02:31.810
and a half tons of steel
that came from a beam

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:34.660
in the World Trade Center towers.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:39.400
And this is the actual ship -- so
what happened is after the events

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:43.830
of September 11th, 2001, a
decision was made to give metal

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.780
from the World Trade
Center towers to the Navy.

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:51.900
The metal was taken to a foundry
in Louisiana where it was melted

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.090
down at a really, really high heat.

00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.920
So hot that it turned into liquid
metal and it was poured into a mold

00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:02.560
into the shape of a navy
ship's bow and it was

00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:05.130
so hot it took four days to cool.

00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.100
And then the bow, what was a
beam but now a bow was then taken

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.880
to a shipyard near New Orleans,
and while the ship was being built,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:20.200
Hurricane Katrina hit the city and
it was a devastating storm and many

00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.110
of the shipbuilders lost
their homes and were homeless,

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:29.590
and temporary housing was built
called Kamp Katrina, K and K,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:33.440
which gave the shipbuilders a
place to live and food to eat

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.490
so that work could
continue on the ship.

00:03:36.490 --> 00:03:39.670
The ship's motto is strength
forged through sacrifice.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.040
Never forget.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.660
And I think it's personally really
powerful that they put the metal

00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:49.480
in the bow of the ship because
the bow is what cuts the water

00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.800
and it's what leads the way.

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.960
So, I wanted to talk for a moment

00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:59.830
about why I love writing
non-fiction.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.500
One of the reasons is I
love learning new things.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:04.810
Whenever I want to
learn something new,

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:07.880
my first stop is always
the children's section

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.870
of my local public library.

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:13.680 position:56%
The tables are a little short and
the chairs are a little small for me

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.870 position:56%
but since I write for children, I
think it's really important to learn

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:18.550
at a child's perspective.

00:04:18.550 --> 00:04:22.290
I think it informs my writing
if I start with picture books.

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:25.910
I can always obviously go up to
adult levels, interview adults,

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:31.320
read adult literature, read adult
magazines, any kind of resource,

00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:35.140
but I think that that's
the place for me to start,

00:04:35.140 --> 00:04:38.940
and I also think personally
that anything you'd ever want

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.360
to know is in a picture book.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:43.550
I also enjoy writing non-fiction

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:47.250
because I do love going
beyond the facts

00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:50.040
to find what I call
the heart of the story.

00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.520
We all live in the digital age
with amazing access to information.

00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:58.410
We can Google anything at
any time and know something

00:04:58.410 --> 00:05:02.890
about something we may have known
nothing about just moments before.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:06.060
But what does all that
information mean

00:05:06.060 --> 00:05:09.720
and does knowing a fact
equate with understanding?

00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.020
So, I knew a fact.

00:05:11.020 --> 00:05:12.720
I knew a beam had been used

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:16.590
in building a Navy ship's
bow, but what did that mean?

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:19.440
What did that mean for the men
and women who built the ship?

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:22.530
What did that mean for the men
and women who serve on the ship?

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:25.840
And what does that mean
for us as a nation?

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:28.800
Those are some of the
questions I was asking myself

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:32.430
as I began researching and
writing this book and it was

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:36.360
through my research that I began
to find the answers and the answers

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:39.460
as they often are were
found in stories.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.630
I heard stories of people
who delayed retirement

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:45.970
so that they could continue working

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:47.520
so that they could
help build the ship.

00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:50.860
I heard stories about people
who requested transfers

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.270
within the military so that they
could serve on the ship, and again

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:59.700 position:56%
and again and again, I heard stories
about people who serve in honor

00:05:59.700 --> 00:06:05.850 position:56%
of someone that they knew, in honor
of New York, in honor of our nation.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:10.170
The first page of the book
reads, "There is a ship.

00:06:10.170 --> 00:06:11.470
A Navy ship.

00:06:11.470 --> 00:06:13.430
It is called the USS New York.

00:06:13.430 --> 00:06:18.380
It is big like other Navy ships
and it sails like other Navy ships

00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:19.990
but there is something different,

00:06:19.990 --> 00:06:23.850
something special about
the USS New York."

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:28.510
I believe that is true because
that ship is part of our history

00:06:28.510 --> 00:06:30.880
and it embodies our stories.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.020
I consider it -- it was
my honor and privilege

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.560
to write this picture book.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:39.590
So, what is a picture book?

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:43.580
It's a story told in two
ways, in words and in images.

00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:49.350
So, when you read a middle grade or
young adult or even an adult novel,

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:52.900
the author has described
everything with words.

00:06:52.900 --> 00:06:56.450
Language is what they use for
the setting, the characters,

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:58.800 position:56%
and the character's emotional state.

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:02.290
But picture book authors,
we have a different job.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:05.900
We have to tell a complete
story while still leaving room

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:09.240
for illustrations, but
the interesting thing is

00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:12.170
that we have no -- at least
I don't, I have no idea

00:07:12.170 --> 00:07:13.470
who the illustrator will be

00:07:13.470 --> 00:07:17.000
so I have no idea what the
pictures will actually look like.

00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.440
So, it isn't until after
I've finished a manuscript,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:24.000
sent it off to an editor, an editor
has decided to take on that project

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.870
that the illustrator is chosen.

00:07:26.870 --> 00:07:30.380
So, it's a little -- the
writing for a picture book author

00:07:30.380 --> 00:07:32.640
without the illustrator is a little

00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.530
like learning a dance
without a dance partner.

00:07:35.530 --> 00:07:37.830
But --

00:07:41.070 --> 00:07:43.280
-- when it all comes together, the
words and the images, the author

00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.650
and the illustrator, that's
when the magic happens,

00:07:45.650 --> 00:07:48.060
and I think picture
books are truly magical

00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:52.680
and I certainly think the work of
Thomas Gonzalez was beyond magical.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.980
It was inspirational.

00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.100
All right, so you're up.

00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.180
[ Applause ]

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.190
&gt;&gt; Thomas Gonzalez: So, I'm Tom
Gonzalez and I was fortunate enough

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:05.720
to do this book with Janet,
and I have done this before.

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.970
I did the "14 Cows For
America" so I knew a little bit

00:08:07.970 --> 00:08:12.940
about the whole world of 9/11.

00:08:12.940 --> 00:08:15.010
It's a very difficult
book to do visually

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:17.610
because usually the
illustrator relies on visuals.

00:08:17.610 --> 00:08:19.420
So, you do the research
and you see things

00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:21.240
that you just don't
want to see again.

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:24.830
But I'm going to walk
through really quickly kind

00:08:24.830 --> 00:08:26.130
of how the process works.

00:08:26.130 --> 00:08:30.100
I'll get the manuscript and
I read it and I put it away,

00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.480
and I actually try to do a
picture book without words.

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:37.120 position:56%
I try to make sure I can communicate
if you cannot really read the word

00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:39.320
but you can kind of put it
together by what you're looking

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:42.110
at which is difficult to do
because you really can't do

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:43.610
that without the words
to begin with.

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:54.030
So, my name -- and basically,
I had some thoughts about it.

00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:57.590
This really kind of goes through
what was the mindset of people

00:08:57.590 --> 00:08:59.810
in the morning before 9/11?

00:08:59.810 --> 00:09:01.380
You know, there was
the World Series.

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:03.720
It's a totally different world,

00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:07.460
and I find it interesting every
time I do something about 9/11

00:09:07.460 --> 00:09:10.850
that the 10th of September
was so different.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:13.410
It was just so different
in so many ways and a lot

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:18.470
of kids don't realize
how it was before.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.760
I basically start with
a gut feeling.

00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.850
I'll do sketches really
quick to capture the space.

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:30.780
Make sure that the person
looking at this doesn't get tired

00:09:30.780 --> 00:09:32.680
of the same image and so forth.

00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:37.830
And I brought -- this is the actual
-- this is how I start a book.

00:09:37.830 --> 00:09:39.940
I spend about a couple of
weeks on this or a week maybe

00:09:39.940 --> 00:09:41.570
and I just kind of lay it out.

00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:42.870
I swap it around.

00:09:42.870 --> 00:09:47.240
It's like making a movie but
this is exactly the one I used

00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:48.540
for this book.

00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:50.750
Now, from here, I'll start
developing what I like.

00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:53.140
I'll make notes, thoughts.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.450
I'll even listen to certain music
to kind of conjure up some ideas

00:09:57.450 --> 00:10:00.510
and things that were
happening at the time.

00:10:00.510 --> 00:10:04.600
It just -- you know,
frame of reference.

00:10:06.970 --> 00:10:11.420
So, an example would be, there
is the sketch over there.

00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:15.460
There's an intermediate sketch
I do that it gets very tight

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:19.100
and it really helps me kind of
spread the page out a little bit

00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:21.570
so that one eye doesn't
really land somewhere.

00:10:21.570 --> 00:10:22.870
It's just the way of the flow.

00:10:22.870 --> 00:10:24.310
It's just a gut feeling.

00:10:24.310 --> 00:10:27.230
And then, that's a
really tight sketch.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:30.150
I usually do it in pencil
and then I'll color it.

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:34.880
I'll start playing with the
color and that's the final.

00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:38.590
Now the final had a rainbow
and when we [inaudible]

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:40.900 position:56%
for press we decided to take it out.

00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:42.670
There's some things that
comes through discussion

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:45.730
that are infinite amount of
discussions about little details,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:47.450
but we do think about
a lot of things.

00:10:47.450 --> 00:10:48.790
We think very carefully.

00:10:48.790 --> 00:10:51.170
So, if you look at the book,
you're not going to see the rainbow

00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:54.390
but you will see this
image right here

00:10:54.390 --> 00:10:57.030
and these are some other examples.

00:10:57.030 --> 00:10:58.840
So, some of the illustrations
in the book.

00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:05.290
I wanted to play off the fire of
9/11 and the coolness of the ocean

00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:09.110
in the ship and there
are some more images too.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:13.390
One thing to note here,
originally when the book was --

00:11:13.390 --> 00:11:16.580
the way I wanted to do the book
was actually a lot of pages

00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:19.080
where there was no text
and it was really scenes

00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:22.430
in New York before
the planes struck.

00:11:22.430 --> 00:11:26.170
So, for example, there is a picture
of New York City with the cabs

00:11:26.170 --> 00:11:29.320
and you can see the reflection
in a mirror of this plane.

00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:31.490
That is not supposed to be there.

00:11:31.490 --> 00:11:33.700
The only reason why those
planes were not supposed to be

00:11:33.700 --> 00:11:36.030
where they're at but
nobody noticed them.

00:11:36.030 --> 00:11:40.410
So, some of the pages you see
the plane somewhere in the plane,

00:11:40.410 --> 00:11:46.570
in the corner somewhere and
everybody is oblivious to that

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:49.910
and there's the ship right there.

00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:54.880
And I think that was it.

00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.970
Any questions?

00:12:03.510 --> 00:12:06.680
[ Inaudible comment ]

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:08.930
&gt;&gt; Thomas Gonzalez: Oh, she
asked if anyone visited the ship.

00:12:08.930 --> 00:12:11.450
I actually had an opportunity to
do that years ago before the --

00:12:11.450 --> 00:12:13.560
when you go buy this
book, I did not.

00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:15.210
So, I did a lot of research.

00:12:15.210 --> 00:12:17.940
I watched a lot of film
over and over again.

00:12:17.940 --> 00:12:22.830
You find stuff that you never
knew you would know but we didn't.

00:12:22.830 --> 00:12:24.130
I made the best effort to learn.

00:12:24.130 --> 00:12:27.820
I had a model of it, the whole
bit just to, and the reason it was

00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.500 position:56%
so important because there was two
or three ships although very similar

00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:33.800
but they're very different.

00:12:33.800 --> 00:12:36.120
So, I didn't want some expert
to say you got the wrong ship

00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.580
because it was just so
confusing when I was doing that.

00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:43.770
&gt;&gt; Janet Nolan: Can
I answer that too?

00:12:43.770 --> 00:12:45.070
&gt;&gt; Thomas Gonzalez: Oh, yeah.

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:46.370
Sure.

00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:47.670
&gt;&gt; Janet Nolan: I haven't seen
the ship either but I know

00:12:47.670 --> 00:12:50.610 position:56%
that the book has just gotten to the
man who's going to become captain

00:12:50.610 --> 00:12:54.820
of the ship shortly and
he sent a personal note

00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:58.800 position:56%
which was really touching to me that
just how much this book meant to him

00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:02.490
and to the people who serve on
the boat, and he actually said,

00:13:02.490 --> 00:13:04.220
"Thank you for writing this story."

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:06.260
So, that was really
powerful to receive

00:13:06.260 --> 00:13:13.130
that from the captain of the ship.

00:13:13.130 --> 00:13:19.720
&gt;&gt; I happen to read this book
with my daughter and I found

00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:24.880
that your style, your painting
style is like oil painting

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:28.740
and also the picture
is like movie-like.

00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:33.070
So, I'm wondering where
you designed the book.

00:13:33.070 --> 00:13:37.650
Do you have such kind of
idea before you design

00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:41.950
that it should be a movie-like
or an oil painting like?

00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:45.270
And so, this is my question.

00:13:45.270 --> 00:13:46.570
&gt;&gt; Thomas Gonzalez: I usually --

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:49.000
I don't do oil paintings
because they take too long to dry

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.640
and I decided that it's
best to just do pastels.

00:13:51.640 --> 00:13:53.760
Usually the way I work,
I'll sketch it out.

00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.820
I'll get tighter and I'll
either get pictures reference

00:13:56.820 --> 00:13:58.920
or I'll even shoot my own
reference or even object

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.220
and then I'll start
putting together --

00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.500
then I work very hard
with the light.

00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:03.850
I do a pastel.

00:14:03.850 --> 00:14:05.150
I do airbrush.

00:14:05.150 --> 00:14:06.450
I do ink on top of it.

00:14:06.450 --> 00:14:08.070
I mean, it's just a bunch of stuff

00:14:08.070 --> 00:14:10.690
and basically I found myself
retouching the illustration

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:11.990
to make it look realistic.

00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.180
I want the reader to
be there in a way.

00:14:14.180 --> 00:14:19.510
Yes, I hope that answers
your question.

00:14:19.510 --> 00:14:28.150
&gt;&gt; Janet, the tone of the book
is perfect in my opinion as far

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:33.220
as how you present this really
awful event in a way that --

00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:35.020
and master the illustration.

00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:39.030
In the beginning there's some
very jarring not a gratuitous

00:14:39.030 --> 00:14:41.070 position:56%
illustration but you show the plane.

00:14:41.070 --> 00:14:43.540
You show a building.

00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:49.960
How did you arrive on the right
tone or voice and what was going

00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:54.430
through your mind as
you developed that tone?

00:14:54.430 --> 00:14:56.990
&gt;&gt; Janet Nolan: I think
for the tone of the book,

00:14:56.990 --> 00:15:00.710
what I did is I never
told myself in my mind

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:03.390
that I was writing a 9/11 book.

00:15:03.390 --> 00:15:06.680
I always thought I was writing
a book about a piece of metal,

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.970
and I stayed pretty close to that
piece of metal that left New York

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:12.290
and went to the foundry
and then to the shipyard

00:15:12.290 --> 00:15:14.440
and became the bow of a ship.

00:15:14.440 --> 00:15:18.190
The book has a silent
beginning, three pages,

00:15:18.190 --> 00:15:21.420
and I think that that's really
brilliant because it puts you --

00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:24.150
there are no words for 9/11.

00:15:24.150 --> 00:15:26.450
There are no words to
describe really what happened

00:15:26.450 --> 00:15:29.670
but those three pages puts
you in the proper mindset

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:33.710
to approach the book and
then my language stays very,

00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:35.030
very close to the metal.

00:15:35.030 --> 00:15:38.210
So, the echo is there and
the sentiment is there,

00:15:38.210 --> 00:15:41.840
but I didn't have to use the
language to describe 9/11,

00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:45.320 position:56%
and I was able to describe something
I think more transformative

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.620
which was about building a ship.

00:15:56.130 --> 00:15:57.430
Thank you so much.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:15:58.730
This was great.

00:15:58.730 --> 00:16:00.030
Thank you.

00:16:00.030 --> 00:16:01.330
&gt;&gt; Thomas Gonzalez: Thanks.

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:02.630
