00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:03.790
The distance from the base of the building to the foot of the ladder, or the

00:00:03.790 --> 00:00:09.184
bottom of the ladder, is 18ft. Great solving for getting this one right. This

00:00:09.184 --> 00:00:13.756
one was tough. To start, we should begin with a diagram. We'll have a building

00:00:13.756 --> 00:00:17.290
and then we'll have a 30ft ladder stretching from the ground up to reach the

00:00:17.290 --> 00:00:22.664
top, or near the top of the building. We need to place the foot of the ladder,

00:00:22.664 --> 00:00:26.885
this part, so that it's distance away from the building, is 6ft less than the

00:00:26.885 --> 00:00:33.079
distance up the building. So if we let this distance be x, we know this

00:00:33.079 --> 00:00:40.150
distance must be x minus 6. Now, this might look confusing. We see a distance

00:00:40.150 --> 00:00:44.376
that's longer here, than it is here. Well, my drawings not to scale. Just

00:00:44.376 --> 00:00:48.918
because you draw a diagram, it doesn't mean it needs to be perfect. We're just

00:00:48.918 --> 00:00:53.278
doing a sketch of the situation so we can solve our problem. So, now that we

00:00:53.278 --> 00:00:56.316
have our expressions for this side and this side and, we have a length of the

00:00:56.316 --> 00:01:01.618
hypotenuse. We're ready to use the Pythagorean theorem. So, we'll square the

00:01:01.618 --> 00:01:07.108
legs, and then we'll square the hypotenuse. This gives us x squared plus x

00:01:07.108 --> 00:01:13.354
squared minus 12x plus 36 equals 900. Combining the like terms here we will get

00:01:13.354 --> 00:01:18.205
2x squared minus 12x plus 36 equals 900, then we subtract 900 from both sides

00:01:18.205 --> 00:01:23.971
to get this equation. Each of these terms is even, so we can divide our

00:01:23.971 --> 00:01:30.112
equation by a factor of two. Now we want a factor of this quadratic. We find

00:01:30.112 --> 00:01:36.944
factors of negative 432 that sum to negative 6. Those two factors are negative

00:01:36.944 --> 00:01:41.520
24 and positive 18. Next, we set each factor equal to 0 and we solve for the

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:48.232
values of x. Positive 24 and negative 18. We know that this distance needs to

00:01:48.232 --> 00:01:53.474
be positive, so this answer is out. This must mean that the distance from the

00:01:53.474 --> 00:01:58.594
bottom of the building to the top of the ladder is 24ft. And the distance from

00:01:58.594 --> 00:02:03.467
the base of the building to the base of the ladder is 18ft. Great solving if

00:02:03.467 --> 00:02:05.622
you got all the way to the end. [NOISE]
