&gt;&gt;Stacy Brown-Philpot: Good afternoon.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:12.210
My name is Stacy Brown-Philpot and I am an
Entrepreneur in Residence at Google Ventures.

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:17.860
And I'm excited to introduce our guests today
from Question Bridge.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:25.160
So Question Bridge started, I guess the concept
back in 1996, when Chris Johnson came up with

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:33.160
the idea of unprompted Q &amp;A as a way of getting
into the minds and the hearts and the beliefs

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.030
of the African American community in San Diego.

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:44.160
Chris is a filmmaker and is notably known
for "The Roof Is On Fire" that he produced

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.470
with a woman named Suzanne Lacy.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:48.600
And it was aired on Crime TV.

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:52.590
And he's gone on to do many other things but
he's currently a professor of photography

00:00:52.590 --> 00:00:54.850
at the California College of Arts.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.700
So Hank found out about what Chris had done
and talked to him.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:00.710
I guess a decade or more than a decade later.

00:01:00.710 --> 00:01:05.930
And talked to him about this project and proposed
the idea of doing something similar for black

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:07.560
males.

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:13.289
Hank's work has been exhibited all over the
world and some of the more famous places,

00:01:13.289 --> 00:01:16.590
like the Guggenheim, and the Museum of Modern
Art.

00:01:16.590 --> 00:01:22.670
And one of his films along the way was featured
at the Sundance Film Festival.

00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:27.509
So these two great minds thinking about media
and art and photography.

00:01:27.509 --> 00:01:28.560
And the black man.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:32.409
Have come together into an inspiring project.

00:01:32.409 --> 00:01:41.240
For the last four years, I think it was, they
went to 11 cities and spoke with over 150

00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:42.240
black men.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.229
Just to ask questions.

00:01:44.229 --> 00:01:46.299
And hear the answers.

00:01:46.299 --> 00:01:49.020
And it was unprompted.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.669
I think they got about 1500 conversations
out of this project.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:02:01.159
And the idea was that people would ask a question
and someone else would answer that question.

00:02:01.159 --> 00:02:06.210
Different person, different mind, as a way
of bridging the gap between socioeconomic

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:10.399
status and also age status.

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:13.470
So they've got some interactive things they're
gonna show us today.

00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:19.030
I think Chris said it well when he describes
this project as a "unrehearsed, totally spontaneous

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.190
expression of the truth."

00:02:21.190 --> 00:02:23.370
And I'm sure you'll enjoy what they both have
to say today.

00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:27.570
And if you wanna see more you can visit the
Oakland Museum where their exhibit will be

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:29.570
on display until July 8th.

00:02:29.570 --> 00:02:32.410
So please welcome Hank Thomas and Chris Johnson.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:33.720
Thank you.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:35.040
[applause]

00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:40.310
&gt;&gt;Chris: Well, I'll begin.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.590
Thank you very much for being here.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.290
I wanna say that it's really an honor to be
here.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:51.180
And I wanna thank Daphne Mews and Anne Farmer
for making this possible for us.

00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:56.430
And as she said, we're here to talk about
a project called "Question Bridge Black Males"

00:02:56.430 --> 00:02:59.430
which has a really ambitious goal.

00:02:59.430 --> 00:03:03.720
What we intend to do with this project is
actually change the way people understand

00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:06.570
the nature of black male consciousness.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.800
Which sounds like a lofty goal but I think
you can understand, given the things that

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:11.270
are happening in our culture right now.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:12.270
And the news.

00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.680
Why that's really important to do.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.120
One of the things I hope we get the chance
to talk about maybe when we do questions and

00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:23.570
answers is exactly why would an artist try
to take on an issue like that and how to go

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:24.590
about it.

00:03:24.590 --> 00:03:31.650
So what we've done is prepare a little clip
to show you just what our methodology is.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:40.940
To give you a sense of what we're doing, and
so, this is our trailer.

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.310
[silence]

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:48.320
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Black man.

00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.820
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Do you wanna get out of the situation
that you're in.

00:03:50.820 --> 00:03:55.061
&gt;&gt;Male #3: What is the reluctance for taking
responsibility for our people and our communities?

00:03:55.061 --> 00:03:57.750
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Are your children better or worse
off as a result of your involvement?

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.700
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Why wouldn't you be happy with
your son being gay?

00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:02.042
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Why are you so violent?

00:04:02.042 --> 00:04:03.042
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Why do you have that "take" mentality?

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:05.010
&gt;&gt;Male #8: Why are you afraid of being intelligent?

00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:06.140
&gt;&gt;Male participants: Why?

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:07.140
Why?

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:08.140
Why?

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:09.140
Why?

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:10.140
Why?

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:11.140
&gt;&gt;Male #9: What I wanna know is

00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.820
&gt;&gt;Male #10: Why?

00:04:13.820 --> 00:04:15.060
[silence]

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:22.090
&gt;&gt;Male #11: I believe that we have incorporated
a lot of things that are unhealthy to us.

00:04:22.090 --> 00:04:23.550
&gt;&gt;Male #12: we are supposed to be tough.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.430
&gt;&gt;Male #13: I can't let 'em see no type of
sucker.

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:27.810
&gt;&gt;Male #14: Along with various other stereotypes.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:31.749
&gt;&gt;Male #15: The level of mentorship in our
community is not as strong as it possibly

00:04:31.749 --> 00:04:32.749
could be.

00:04:32.749 --> 00:04:36.250
&gt;&gt;Male #16: When I came up, crack was a quick
way for a black man to make a million dollars.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:40.289
&gt;&gt;Male #17: Sometimes I think because we think
we're black we're some other kind of human

00:04:40.289 --> 00:04:41.289
beings.

00:04:41.289 --> 00:04:42.780
But we are just like most other human beings.

00:04:42.780 --> 00:04:43.780
[silence]

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:49.569
&gt;&gt;Male #18: Why didn't y'all leave us the
blueprint?

00:04:49.569 --> 00:04:52.610
&gt;&gt;Male #19: We did leave you a blueprint.

00:04:52.610 --> 00:04:53.610
&gt;&gt;Male #20: We did leave you a blueprint.

00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:54.620
&gt;&gt;Male #21: We just didn't tell you where
it was.

00:04:54.620 --> 00:04:57.030
&gt;&gt;Male #22: That's something that we dropped
the ball on.

00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:58.389
&gt;&gt;Male #23: What do you fear?

00:04:58.389 --> 00:05:02.951
&gt;&gt;Male #24: That something will harm my children,
and

00:05:02.951 --> 00:05:03.951
&gt;&gt;Male #25: I fear success.

00:05:03.951 --> 00:05:05.699
&gt;&gt;Male #26: Am I the only one who has problem
eating chicken, watermelon and bananas in

00:05:05.699 --> 00:05:06.759
front of white people?

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:08.080
&gt;&gt;Male #27: Hah, hah, hah.

00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.400
&gt;&gt;Male #28: Alright, that's crazy.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.400
[laughing]

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:12.210
&gt;&gt;Male #29: That word, he has to stop using
it.

00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:13.889
&gt;&gt;Male #30: I think black people can say "Nigga"
any time they want.

00:05:13.889 --> 00:05:15.430
&gt;&gt;Male #31: How dare you?

00:05:15.430 --> 00:05:17.169
What right do you have to use this word?

00:05:17.169 --> 00:05:18.250
&gt;&gt;Male #32: Lot of "nigger" questions for
the rapper.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:23.189
&gt;&gt;Male #33: What is common to all of us, that
we can say makes us who we are?

00:05:23.189 --> 00:05:24.259
&gt;&gt;Male #34: Hm.

00:05:24.259 --> 00:05:27.330
&gt;&gt;Male #35: This is the easiest question in
the world to answer.

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:34.129
&gt;&gt;Male #36: The thing that we have in common
is that we are male, and we are black.

00:05:34.129 --> 00:05:35.430
[silence]

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:43.879
&gt;&gt;Male #37: My question is, I try to live
good, but I'm surrounded by bad.

00:05:43.879 --> 00:05:51.400
And I wanna know, what it is I could do to
do better and live peaceful.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.680
Surrounded by all evil.

00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:56.220
How can I do that?

00:05:56.220 --> 00:05:57.889
[silence]

00:05:57.889 --> 00:06:03.199
&gt;&gt;Chris: So what that brief sequence does
is give you a sense of what we've tried to

00:06:03.199 --> 00:06:04.199
do.

00:06:04.199 --> 00:06:09.930
And that is, to take the deceptively simple
process of asking a question and put that

00:06:09.930 --> 00:06:14.911
right into the heart of one of the most pressing
and troubling social concerns of our time.

00:06:14.911 --> 00:06:19.520
And that is, the fact that the black community
is radically divided from itself.

00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:26.180
The fact that black men are having to contend
with being one of the most opaque, and troubled

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.990
demographics in our time.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:36.479
What we've done is just experiment with the
idea that black men not only have really deep

00:06:36.479 --> 00:06:39.469
questions about all the concerns that affect
their lives.

00:06:39.469 --> 00:06:41.289
But they also have the answers.

00:06:41.289 --> 00:06:47.129
And putting them together, gives us a chance
to really understand from the position of

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:51.620
privileged witnesses, that this conversation
is very complex.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.400
And it unfolds in the installation that we
created.

00:06:54.400 --> 00:07:01.460
But it has a history, as she said, that began
with my experience when I was growing up in

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:02.460
Brooklyn.

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.629
This is a slide by the photographer Roy DeCarava.

00:07:05.629 --> 00:07:09.800
And I use this as a way of illustrating the
way that I experienced Bed-Stuy when I was

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.800
growing up.

00:07:10.800 --> 00:07:12.909
As a kid in the '40s and '50s.

00:07:12.909 --> 00:07:19.759
At that time, the black community was still
forced to live in one community by itself.

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:24.120
I mean, there were many many generations and
many different socioeconomic classes.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:29.629
I don't wanna oversimplify the fact that there
was obviously crime and lots of other issues.

00:07:29.629 --> 00:07:33.409
But what I love about this slide is that it
gives a sense of the way I experienced the

00:07:33.409 --> 00:07:35.879
black community as a child.

00:07:35.879 --> 00:07:39.689
You see a mother, maybe walking her children
from school.

00:07:39.689 --> 00:07:44.869
And that sense of being part of a community
that was a whole with all of the issues that

00:07:44.869 --> 00:07:46.300
were part of it.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:51.550
But then with the passage of the Civil Rights
laws, one of the unintended consequences was,

00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:52.669
there was a split in the community.

00:07:52.669 --> 00:07:57.430
Those who were able to leave the African American
community did.

00:07:57.430 --> 00:08:03.490
So this next slide by Bruce Davidson is probably
more typical of the way people think of the

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:04.750
black community.

00:08:04.750 --> 00:08:08.919
And it typifies a lot of the problems that
we suffer.

00:08:08.919 --> 00:08:13.749
And so, what happened was, I left New York
when I was 17.

00:08:13.749 --> 00:08:15.129
Came to California.

00:08:15.129 --> 00:08:17.869
I was very lucky to have mentors.

00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:19.229
That brought me into the photography world.

00:08:19.229 --> 00:08:23.009
I studied photography with Ansel Adams, Judy
Dader, Winn Bullock.

00:08:23.009 --> 00:08:24.770
And people like that.

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:29.130
And I became a professor at California College
of the Arts over the years.

00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:33.990
And Suzanne Lacy who's renowned performance
artist.

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:38.370
She's really well known for going to communities
and trying to assess what the issues and values

00:08:38.370 --> 00:08:40.070
in that community are.

00:08:40.070 --> 00:08:45.350
And she and I formed a collaboration that
gave us a chance to work with kids like this

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.850
in high schools.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:50.640
We created a project called "The Roof is On
Fire."

00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:57.270
And what we did was, take the idea that young
kids if you create a safe environment around

00:08:57.270 --> 00:09:03.870
them, will reveal truths that they'll withhold
from you if they are aware that you are there.

00:09:03.870 --> 00:09:06.920
So what we did was, we put the kids in cars
on a rooftop.

00:09:06.920 --> 00:09:10.590
We got the commission, the rooftop of a parking
garage.

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:16.570
We put 200 cars with kids in the cars and
we told the kids that they were to use the

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:19.070
car as a safe place to talk.

00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.660
And so they had a badge around their necks
that said "Shut up and listen" and that was

00:09:23.660 --> 00:09:28.850
a way for the audience to create an opportunity
to really hear the truth from their point

00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:29.850
of view.

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:34.450
And they talked, as you can imagine, about
issues that were passionately important to

00:09:34.450 --> 00:09:35.450
them.

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:40.160
They talked about sex, and drugs and values
and language.

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.460
And it was a really animated conversation.

00:09:43.460 --> 00:09:48.940
But one of the things that inspired it was,
inspired the whole process, was that they

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:52.780
felt as if they were given permission to really
be listened to.

00:09:52.780 --> 00:09:59.030
And you can see in this slide the woman in
the background, is performing the generous

00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:01.620
act of listening to these young people.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:03.910
And it was a really powerful experience.

00:10:03.910 --> 00:10:08.180
And I think the people who saw it came away
with real different insights into what was

00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:12.350
going on in the lives of these young people.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:18.040
So that project was broadcast on KORN.

00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:22.140
And I sort of became known in the art world
for doing projects like this.

00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:26.020
And a few years later, I was commissioned
by the Museum of Photographic Arts in San

00:10:26.020 --> 00:10:33.850
Diego to do a project called "Republic" And
they asked me to do something that related

00:10:33.850 --> 00:10:35.070
to the black community.

00:10:35.070 --> 00:10:39.160
And I thought back to that initial experience
I had as a young person of seeing the black

00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:44.140
community divide into those who made a decision
to leave the community, to seek opportunities

00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:45.140
and freedom.

00:10:45.140 --> 00:10:46.200
Which is great.

00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:48.210
But of course there is a cost to that.

00:10:48.210 --> 00:10:53.870
And the one thing that I took away from the
initial experience was the fact that listening

00:10:53.870 --> 00:10:56.640
is a passive form of being very generous.

00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.220
But there's probably a more active way to
do that.

00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:00.590
And that's asking a question.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:05.500
So what I decided to do was give people on
both sides of this divide.

00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.950
Those who live within inner city working class
neighborhoods and those who don't.

00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.170
To ask questions of those on the other side
and vice versa.

00:11:13.170 --> 00:11:15.710
So what you're seeing here is Keyona Johnson.

00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:21.370
She's a woman who lives in the inner city
of San Diego.

00:11:21.370 --> 00:11:25.290
And William Gaines.

00:11:25.290 --> 00:11:28.910
And so I gave her a chance to ask questions
of him.

00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:29.910
And vice versa.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:34.060
So what I'm gonna show you is a brief clip
of this exchange.

00:11:34.060 --> 00:11:38.360
[on video]
&gt;&gt;William: Have you given any thought to where

00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:41.950
the money comes from for people who are receiving
public assistance?

00:11:41.950 --> 00:11:44.130
And do you care?

00:11:44.130 --> 00:11:49.100
&gt;&gt;Keyona: I've thought about where public
assistant money come from.

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:50.930
And I do care.

00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:56.910
But for one, I am on public assistance and
it's not because we don't wanna work.

00:11:56.910 --> 00:12:00.050
It's not because we wanna sit at home and
get a check.

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.350
Or anything like that.

00:12:01.350 --> 00:12:06.890
A lot of people perceive us young teenage
mothers to sit at home and just collect a

00:12:06.890 --> 00:12:07.890
check.

00:12:07.890 --> 00:12:10.720
Where a lot of times, we do go out and look
for work.

00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:11.720
We do work.

00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:14.380
We can't work as long because childcare is
really up there.

00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.060
At this point in time, I pay 300 dollars a
month and I have two.

00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:21.122
And I pay 150 dollars a month for another
child.

00:12:21.122 --> 00:12:24.520
The 300 is 'cause my child is under two.

00:12:24.520 --> 00:12:28.370
The 150 is 'cause my child is over two and
is school age.

00:12:28.370 --> 00:12:30.330
So yes, I know where the money comes from.

00:12:30.330 --> 00:12:32.590
It comes from tax payers.

00:12:32.590 --> 00:12:37.380
But we do have people who take up American
jobs who are not taxpayers.

00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:40.170
Because they're not an American citizen.

00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:41.640
How about that?

00:12:41.640 --> 00:12:45.310
We get decreases in our checks because we're
American citizen.

00:12:45.310 --> 00:12:52.160
But yet if you're a refugee or you're an immigrant,
or a legal working alien in the united states.

00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:56.660
You get a increase in your check when you
come over here from different countries.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:02.570
Because the united states government have,
so called, some kinda agreement with them.

00:13:02.570 --> 00:13:08.030
They come over here and they're able to get
grants to start business.

00:13:08.030 --> 00:13:12.050
Where we are already living here working,
doing the backbone of the country.

00:13:12.050 --> 00:13:15.320
And we don't get that same type of respect.

00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:19.990
But yeah, people look down upon us because
we are on public assistance.

00:13:19.990 --> 00:13:24.280
They like to say "Oh, the black teenage moms,
they're going out openin' their legs and havin'

00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:27.060
babies just to get on welfare, to get out
the house."

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:28.310
That is not always the case.

00:13:28.310 --> 00:13:30.470
It's a small proportion that does that.

00:13:30.470 --> 00:13:35.030
But you only focus on this small portion.

00:13:35.030 --> 00:13:39.170
&gt;&gt;Chris: So you can imagine what it was like
for me to be in the middle of this process

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:43.230
and have this kind of really amazing truth
telling.

00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:46.980
Just emerge spontaneously from the people
who were involved with it.

00:13:46.980 --> 00:13:51.650
The piece that I put together for the MOPA
installation was an hour's worth of really

00:13:51.650 --> 00:13:55.980
poignant questions and answers that came from
the people who were involved.

00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:59.430
So I knew that somehow or another that this
process was animating something that these

00:13:59.430 --> 00:14:01.040
people wanted to share.

00:14:01.040 --> 00:14:04.990
Where did these incredibly articulate answers
come from?

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:09.390
So that's who Question Bridge was born.

00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:14.540
I had ambitions back in '96 of it maybe becoming
an HBO documentary and going on.

00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:16.600
It turned out not to happen that way.

00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.590
Basically I sent it around to a bunch of friends.

00:14:18.590 --> 00:14:25.420
Luckily one of the friends I sent it to was
the mother of Hank Willis Thomas.

00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.360
And I think Hank will pick up the story from
here.

00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360
&gt;&gt;Hank: yeah.

00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:33.260
So, I had [clears throat] I went to the California
college of the arts for graduate school when

00:14:33.260 --> 00:14:35.750
I was photo major.

00:14:35.750 --> 00:14:37.480
And I was one of Chris's students.

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.120
He was my mentor.

00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:46.370
And along the way, I, both seeing image, seeing
a documentary of "The Roof is On Fire" but

00:14:46.370 --> 00:14:49.560
I also saw him do a presentation on Question
Bridge.

00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:54.540
And about three years after I graduated I
was offered an opportunity to apply for a

00:14:54.540 --> 00:14:58.710
fellowship from the Tribeca Film Institute
for New Media.

00:14:58.710 --> 00:15:07.040
And around the same time I came across a VHS
that my mother had of the Question Bridge

00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:08.940
original installation.

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:15.810
And I, it struck me as having so much potential.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.560
Because of the rawness with which the exchange,
happened.

00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:22.440
And in fact one of the things Chris talked
about was the fact that you, if you have the

00:15:22.440 --> 00:15:27.560
same people in the same room, having a discourse,
it'd be a lot more contentious.

00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.360
And people would be less willing to listen
to each other.

00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:37.890
But somehow by mediating a conversation through
video, it allows for a deeper way of listening

00:15:37.890 --> 00:15:44.250
and a more sincere and earnest response.

00:15:44.250 --> 00:15:50.020
And myself and one of our collaborators Bayete
Ross Smith who also went to CCA, were doing

00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:55.750
a lot of work contending with issues about
the limitations of notions of black male identity.

00:15:55.750 --> 00:15:56.750
Especially.

00:15:56.750 --> 00:16:03.040
And I was really interested in how we could
use this Question Bridge model to speak to

00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.360
what I saw as the diversity within the African
American male demographic.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:10.520
Which kind of is frequently spoken about in
monolithic ways.

00:16:10.520 --> 00:16:16.720
And so I approached Chris about how we could
possibly apply to do a Question Bridge about

00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:17.720
black males.

00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:25.220
And so over and through that we wound up traveling
with Bayete Ross Smith and then soon our fourth

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.900
collaborator Kamal Sinclaire came on board.

00:16:27.900 --> 00:16:30.821
And then actors Jesse Williams and Delroy
Lindow.

00:16:30.821 --> 00:16:35.790
And then my mother came on board as executive
producers to kind of help create this team

00:16:35.790 --> 00:16:41.050
to kind of fulfill this kind of undetermined
mission.

00:16:41.050 --> 00:16:42.580
At the time.

00:16:42.580 --> 00:16:46.570
Which soon became this vision to represent
and redefine black male identity.

00:16:46.570 --> 00:16:49.930
But the simplicity of the way the project
worked has already been expressed but this

00:16:49.930 --> 00:16:50.930
is a brief illustration.

00:16:50.930 --> 00:16:51.930
[video playing]

00:16:51.930 --> 00:16:55.050
&gt;&gt;Male #33: My question to the black man in
America, or anywhere else, is, what is common

00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:56.500
to all of us?

00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:58.380
That we can say makes us who we are?

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:01.710
&gt;&gt;Hank: So we found this personality in Philadelphia
Pennsylvania.

00:17:01.710 --> 00:17:03.680
And he asked this question.

00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.929
And we then went around and found people to
answer the question.

00:17:06.929 --> 00:17:08.569
And this is just one of the answers.

00:17:08.569 --> 00:17:09.569
[video playing]

00:17:09.569 --> 00:17:13.180
&gt;&gt;Male # 37: Our commonality is in our history.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:17.520
But I think our beauty as black people is
also in our diversity.

00:17:17.520 --> 00:17:21.450
&gt;&gt;Hank: And so at first we thought about just
doing this as a simple one to one.

00:17:21.450 --> 00:17:24.850
Just one person asks the question, another
person answered it.

00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:30.010
One of the real essential elements of the
project was this idea that we pride ourselves

00:17:30.010 --> 00:17:35.470
in being a diverse nation, where everyone
has these kind of, can be, a space to be themselves.

00:17:35.470 --> 00:17:41.400
But we all contend with narrow notions of
who we are at the end of the day.

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:46.070
And kind of live under these clouds of assumptions
about our own perception by other people.

00:17:46.070 --> 00:17:49.850
But one of the things that we're really trying
to contend with at our project is, how do

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:52.930
people within that group relate to one another
and each other.

00:17:52.930 --> 00:17:58.710
And how does that affect things like the achievement
gap, the discipline gap, the over representation

00:17:58.710 --> 00:18:02.620
of black males in prison.

00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:06.290
And one of the things that we really feel
like this project has the potential to do

00:18:06.290 --> 00:18:08.910
is affect the major thing called "implicit
bias".

00:18:08.910 --> 00:18:13.401
Which was a major factor in the Trayvon Martin
case where somebody sees a young black male

00:18:13.401 --> 00:18:17.530
in a hood and makes this whole host of assumptions
about that person.

00:18:17.530 --> 00:18:22.330
And that affects the way that many African
Americans, travel, navigate the world.

00:18:22.330 --> 00:18:27.980
And African American men, especially, benefit
from people seeing more whole and diverse

00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:29.230
representations of who they are.

00:18:29.230 --> 00:18:35.240
Rather than seeing one or two or three people
actually seeing how each of them is a representation

00:18:35.240 --> 00:18:38.160
of only themselves as individuals.

00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:42.100
&gt;&gt;Chris: So this is an illustration of the
methodology.

00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:50.650
Just to make it clear, what we really do,
as naive as it seems, is we simply touch black

00:18:50.650 --> 00:18:51.650
men wherever we are.

00:18:51.650 --> 00:18:55.120
We, there are instances where we saw a black
man who looked interesting.

00:18:55.120 --> 00:19:00.040
There was a guy in Chicago who had a guardian
angel's hat on.

00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:04.450
The very first man in our project was someone
sitting next to me on the plane.

00:19:04.450 --> 00:19:10.340
That I said "This project is something that
gives black men who have questions about other

00:19:10.340 --> 00:19:13.510
black men a chance to ask those questions
and get answers."

00:19:13.510 --> 00:19:18.309
And so we would simply go around and we'd
say "Do you have a question you'd wanna ask

00:19:18.309 --> 00:19:20.780
another black man you feel very different
from?"

00:19:20.780 --> 00:19:26.310
And surprisingly black men no matter where
we were said "Sure, I have a question."

00:19:26.310 --> 00:19:31.650
And so they would sit in front of our little
makeshift studio, and you can see me here

00:19:31.650 --> 00:19:33.540
setting up lights around this person.

00:19:33.540 --> 00:19:35.330
And we simply give them a chance to ask the
question.

00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:38.260
So the questions come spontaneously from these
people.

00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.660
And then you can imagine that once you've
built a critical mass of these really powerful

00:19:42.660 --> 00:19:43.660
questions.

00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.270
And one of the things that Hank said is that
this is perceived as an opportunity by the

00:19:47.270 --> 00:19:52.300
men in it to really reach inside their own
lives and be reflective about what do they

00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:56.280
think defines a difference between them and
somebody else.

00:19:56.280 --> 00:19:59.492
You can imagine how different the project
would be, what a different dynamic it would

00:19:59.492 --> 00:20:03.200
be if we said "Do you have a question for
someone that you admire?"

00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.400
What you would get is a very very different
process.

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:12.750
And this man was a librarian in the museum
where we were appearing.

00:20:12.750 --> 00:20:13.750
And.

00:20:13.750 --> 00:20:14.750
&gt;&gt;Hank: Birmingham Alabama.

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:19.940
&gt;&gt;Chris: And because we had no idea what the
men were gonna ask, it was really remarkable.

00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.640
So this is a good example.

00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:23.640
[video]

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.310
&gt;&gt;Male #38: You know, I wonder, black man,
are you really ready for freedom?

00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:35.400
And if not, what would it take for you to
want and need this freedom?

00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:42.370
&gt;&gt;Chris: So you can imagine that once we have
these questions, you are kind of assigned

00:20:42.370 --> 00:20:47.980
by the nature of the project to try to find
a place to get a poignant answer.

00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:52.600
Because this question related to freedom,
one of the things that a lot of the issues

00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.380
that came up dealt with was the issue of the
behavior of black men.

00:20:57.380 --> 00:21:01.090
And so we knew that we needed to go to prisons
if that was possible.

00:21:01.090 --> 00:21:05.350
I got the opportunity to teach meditation
at the county jail in San Francisco.

00:21:05.350 --> 00:21:09.660
The administration there became comfortable
enough with me to allow us to bring in cameras

00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:10.660
and lights.

00:21:10.660 --> 00:21:14.200
And so we asked, we presented that question
in video form to this man.

00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:15.750
And here's his answer.

00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:17.520
&gt;&gt;Male #39.

00:21:17.520 --> 00:21:21.950
Am I ready for freedom?

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:25.790
And what would it take for me to want that
freedom?

00:21:25.790 --> 00:21:29.140
First I would have to stop and ax myself,
man.

00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:32.200
That's a tough question.

00:21:32.200 --> 00:21:35.110
'cause freedom to me is a mind state.

00:21:35.110 --> 00:21:39.140
You know, because you got some people that's
not in jail that's not free.

00:21:39.140 --> 00:21:43.140
You know, you got people that's in prison,
in dysfunctional relationships.

00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:45.580
You got people that's in prison with jobs.

00:21:45.580 --> 00:21:48.220
They work nine to five, that they don't like.

00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.610
Some people are in prisons with alcohol and
drug abuse.

00:21:51.610 --> 00:21:58.350
So I would have to, um, ax myself, what's
imprisoning me.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:00.760
And what's been imprisoning me is self-esteem.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:02.429
My lack of self-esteem.

00:22:02.429 --> 00:22:05.730
My lack of self-esteem has led me to commit
crime.

00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:06.780
To hurt people.

00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:09.050
To manipulate people.

00:22:09.050 --> 00:22:13.550
Because if I loved myself there's no way I
could walk outside this room and punish somebody.

00:22:13.550 --> 00:22:15.040
And esteem within myself.

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:19.790
So to be free, to me, would have to be, I
would have to change.

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:20.790
You know.

00:22:20.790 --> 00:22:24.230
So in order for me to grow I have to change,
because if change is necessary for growth,

00:22:24.230 --> 00:22:29.360
in order for me to grow, I would have to adapt
the mentality of something's gonna have to

00:22:29.360 --> 00:22:30.360
change in me.

00:22:30.360 --> 00:22:31.390
I'd have to change my mind state.

00:22:31.390 --> 00:22:33.010
I'd have to change the way I talk.

00:22:33.010 --> 00:22:35.920
I'd have to change the people I interact with.

00:22:35.920 --> 00:22:37.650
That would be "free."

00:22:37.650 --> 00:22:42.700
&gt;&gt;Hank: So one of the things that was so fascinating
to me, actually having in the room with Chris

00:22:42.700 --> 00:22:45.280
and Bayete when we showed this question.

00:22:45.280 --> 00:22:49.850
That was his immediate, three seconds later
response to seeing that image on the screen.

00:22:49.850 --> 00:22:53.820
And I think watching some of your faces here,
it's, your experience and that feeling that

00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:55.730
we feel like really works for Question Bridge.

00:22:55.730 --> 00:23:00.570
Like, how else were we gonna get someone to
give that kind of authentic response.

00:23:00.570 --> 00:23:07.230
Or, if you walked up on the street corner
like, you know, do, what is it, you know?

00:23:07.230 --> 00:23:09.750
Asked 'em that freedom question.

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:12.370
"Do you really feel free?"

00:23:12.370 --> 00:23:14.120
Is that what are they gonna say?

00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:15.870
Or you go to jail, whatever.

00:23:15.870 --> 00:23:21.520
And I think that potency for the project was
something that really got us through the doors

00:23:21.520 --> 00:23:27.050
and things like the Bay Area Video Coalition's
and the Producers Institute and Sundance where

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:30.100
we met Eric Dovesburger who works here at
Google.

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:36.710
And Sundance New Frontier story lab with Bayete
and Kamal Sinclair.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:44.880
Went, were at BAVC—this is Kamal, kind of
being, kind of very efficient with our ideas.

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:48.179
And started to think about how all the ways
our project could work.

00:23:48.179 --> 00:23:52.679
And initially we thought about doing a documentary.

00:23:52.679 --> 00:23:58.059
And as we started to brainstorming, the documentary
kind of fell to like fifth place among the

00:23:58.059 --> 00:24:00.450
ways the project could grow.

00:24:00.450 --> 00:24:03.120
So we thought about the art installation.

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.559
There's a website that we're working on.

00:24:05.559 --> 00:24:12.010
And then Kamal, Chris and Bayete put together
a curriculum that is being used and piloted

00:24:12.010 --> 00:24:17.830
in ninth through twelfth grade classes in
the Bay Area and also in New York.

00:24:17.830 --> 00:24:21.809
And then these community events that we've
been doing.

00:24:21.809 --> 00:24:25.380
And then hopefully eventually it'll happen,
we can do the documentary.

00:24:25.380 --> 00:24:32.090
But we approached Rene DeGuzman from the Oakland
Museum and also the Brooklyn Museum about

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:35.730
this idea of having a simultaneous launch
of the installation and we showed this kind

00:24:35.730 --> 00:24:44.910
of 3D animation of how the installation might
work.

00:24:44.910 --> 00:24:51.210
[many voices talking on animation]

00:24:51.210 --> 00:24:57.340
&gt;&gt;Male #1 in animation: So much.

00:24:57.340 --> 00:25:01.230
So many of you, using the racial slur.

00:25:01.230 --> 00:25:04.240
And you know what word I'm talkin' about.

00:25:04.240 --> 00:25:05.730
It's very serious.

00:25:05.730 --> 00:25:07.990
We have to stop usin' it.

00:25:07.990 --> 00:25:09.200
Why don't you stop?

00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:13.210
&gt;&gt;Male #2 in animation: I think it's bullshit
that black people can't say "nigger."

00:25:13.210 --> 00:25:15.410
I love saying "nigger" and I think it's' fantastic.

00:25:15.410 --> 00:25:18.330
First of all it's one of the most beautiful
words to use in the English language because

00:25:18.330 --> 00:25:19.330
it can express so much.

00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:23.440
Much like the word "f---" The other thing
is, you can't give white people magic power

00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:24.750
over us with a word.

00:25:24.750 --> 00:25:28.860
Like if we stop saying a word because white
people use it poorly.

00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:30.040
That's an absurdity.

00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:35.070
And it also gives them much more power than
they would have if we just used the word freely

00:25:35.070 --> 00:25:36.390
and enjoyed ourself with it.

00:25:36.390 --> 00:25:37.920
We have much bigger issues.

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:41.960
&gt;&gt;Male #3 in animation: I think it's a ignorant
statement and I refuse to use it myself.

00:25:41.960 --> 00:25:47.630
And I've heard the argument that by saying
it in popular culture we're desensitizing

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:48.770
the effect of this word.

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:49.850
I think that's foolish.

00:25:49.850 --> 00:25:56.110
And it just blows me away when I hear people
who are not even black now, like other minorities

00:25:56.110 --> 00:25:57.690
who are around black people when they say
this.

00:25:57.690 --> 00:25:58.990
Have no idea of the historical significance
in this word.

00:25:58.990 --> 00:26:05.510
And I think they're showing their own ignorance
by continuing to say this word in public.

00:26:05.510 --> 00:26:11.240
&gt;&gt;Male #4 in animation: For myself, among
friends and people I've known for a long time,

00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:16.790
and that we understand each other or feel
we understand each other, we can use that,

00:26:16.790 --> 00:26:18.150
use "the N word."

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:22.780
That's the way I look at it, and I hate to
hear people, when they say you shouldn't use

00:26:22.780 --> 00:26:29.410
the word in any setting, as if no other group,
no one ever discusses that other groups, racial

00:26:29.410 --> 00:26:31.150
groups do the same thing.

00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:38.380
They use the word among Italians, Polish,
Irish, I've heard them say it among themselves.

00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:45.720
They call each other "dago," "pollack," "guinea,"
"mick," and, but you understand that you can't

00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:49.710
use that word in their group.

00:26:49.710 --> 00:26:51.360
And how it would be taken.

00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:52.930
So it's a little different.

00:26:52.930 --> 00:26:58.290
It depends on what setting you're in and who's
using the word.

00:26:58.290 --> 00:27:02.200
Chris: So what you're seeing here is a CGI
that we put together to help us think through

00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:04.420
how do we deliver this content.

00:27:04.420 --> 00:27:06.770
What we've gathered is so precious.

00:27:06.770 --> 00:27:14.340
I mean one of the things you saw on this slide
was the dynamic of a powerful question letting

00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:16.080
loose so many different answers.

00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:21.190
And we realized what we need to do is honor
all of those answers and give people a chance

00:27:21.190 --> 00:27:26.830
to feel as if they were surrounded by these
black men in almost a sacred space.

00:27:26.830 --> 00:27:30.780
That's why they're organized on five pillars
in kind of an arc.

00:27:30.780 --> 00:27:35.030
So you have a chance to sort of be embraced
by the people that are talking.

00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:38.700
And what we wanted the people who were witnessing
this to feel like as if they were sort of

00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:39.700
invisible.

00:27:39.700 --> 00:27:43.940
They were privileged witnesses to this very
intense conversation that has many dimensions.

00:27:43.940 --> 00:27:49.840
'Cause what you see from this little sequence
is, a question like something like the word

00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:50.840
"nigger."

00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:52.880
Generates so many different answers.

00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:56.580
There's no general agreement among black men
about how to relate to that word.

00:27:56.580 --> 00:28:00.169
So one of the things that we felt like we
needed to do in putting together the installation

00:28:00.169 --> 00:28:06.940
was honor that diversity of values and give
people a chance to see that there's an internal

00:28:06.940 --> 00:28:12.120
debate that goes on within the greater consciousness
of black men about all these issues.

00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:17.370
And the range of issues that this project
automatically generated was really almost

00:28:17.370 --> 00:28:18.840
it was inspiring.

00:28:18.840 --> 00:28:24.930
As she said earlier, we spent four years traveling
to a dozen cities around the country.

00:28:24.930 --> 00:28:27.010
Sampling black men talking.

00:28:27.010 --> 00:28:32.830
And one of the things that always surprised
us was as Hank said, how prepared these men

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.670
were to answer those questions.

00:28:34.670 --> 00:28:39.860
So it gave us a chance to thing conceptually,
why was that possible.

00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:43.540
It's certainly a pressurized situation when
you invite a stranger into the studio.

00:28:43.540 --> 00:28:46.230
You put a camera and a monitor in front of
them and give them a chance to talk.

00:28:46.230 --> 00:28:47.360
Why does it work?

00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:53.919
And one of the things we realized is that
internally, marginalized people, and maybe

00:28:53.919 --> 00:28:58.790
all of us, are sort of rehearsing answers
that to questions that float over us like

00:28:58.790 --> 00:28:59.790
a cloud.

00:28:59.790 --> 00:29:04.600
And so what we're doing is tapping into this
question cloud that people are looking for

00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:05.890
opportunities to share.

00:29:05.890 --> 00:29:08.470
So that's what Question Bridge is more than
anything else.

00:29:08.470 --> 00:29:14.500
It's a vehicle for the transference of inner
truths that are always there and when you

00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.800
tap into a demographic that really is underrepresented.

00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:24.200
One of the things that we thought about is
that it's very much like giving Ralph Ellison's

00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.820
"Invisible Man" a place to speak.

00:29:26.820 --> 00:29:27.920
That's what this is about.

00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:33.870
'Cause if you look at black men all around
you, they have so much to tell us about survival,

00:29:33.870 --> 00:29:36.919
about accountability, about consequences.

00:29:36.919 --> 00:29:41.970
One of the things that we were, it was vital
for us to do was not populate this project

00:29:41.970 --> 00:29:44.350
with too many well-known black men.

00:29:44.350 --> 00:29:49.160
We wanted it to feel as if you could walk
out and encounter any black man in the world.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:56.460
And that would, that person could be part
of Question Bridge.

00:29:56.460 --> 00:30:02.160
So we had this idea [chuckles] and then the
question is, what do you do with it?

00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:09.110
And once it sort of formulated itself into
the idea of the installation, we were very

00:30:09.110 --> 00:30:17.090
lucky to get an opportunity to do a presentation
at the Brooklyn Museum and much to our surprise

00:30:17.090 --> 00:30:18.610
they embraced it.

00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:19.870
Almost immediately.

00:30:19.870 --> 00:30:25.820
And not only were they willing to commit a
six month installation of the show, but it's

00:30:25.820 --> 00:30:27.480
actually still there.

00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:35.140
But then they encountered Rene de Guzman who's
sitting here with us and Rene and Charles

00:30:35.140 --> 00:30:40.400
Edemere decided to make a bi-coastal representation
of it.

00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:45.690
So here's this representation of black men
talking on both sides of the country.

00:30:45.690 --> 00:30:51.580
We also the next slide will show that we opened
this year at New Frontier at Sundance which

00:30:51.580 --> 00:30:54.130
was a real honor.

00:30:54.130 --> 00:30:59.000
We also simultaneously opened at the Utah
Museum of Contemporary Art and the City of

00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:03.000
Atlanta committed the Chastain gallery to
a single channel version.

00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.240
We'll be showing you a version of that shortly.

00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:11.360
The way the five channel dynamics looks when
you condense it down to one channel.

00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:16.429
These are installations, shots of the way
it appears in Brooklyn.

00:31:16.429 --> 00:31:19.470
Every space of course has to treat it a little
bit differently.

00:31:19.470 --> 00:31:26.500
At Oakland for example it's divided between
two galleries, and what it amounts to is a

00:31:26.500 --> 00:31:30.440
three hour, five channel, high definition
experience.

00:31:30.440 --> 00:31:36.370
You can imagine for us going to Sundance what
it was like to sort of be there as directors

00:31:36.370 --> 00:31:38.880
of this high definition three hour movie.

00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:43.809
And the project, as Hank said, organically
needed to represent itself in many different

00:31:43.809 --> 00:31:44.809
ways.

00:31:44.809 --> 00:31:50.610
So one of the different things we did was
collaborate with InnoVent, a software development

00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:52.140
and web design company.

00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:54.700
And we created this mobile app.

00:31:54.700 --> 00:31:58.660
Because what we realized was that it was really
important for us to get the experience of

00:31:58.660 --> 00:32:02.720
the presence of a black man asking you a question
out into the world.

00:32:02.720 --> 00:32:09.450
So what the kiosk experience in the museums
allows you to do is have preselected questions

00:32:09.450 --> 00:32:10.840
presented to you.

00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:12.660
You get to identify yourself.

00:32:12.660 --> 00:32:14.670
In terms of your demographic.

00:32:14.670 --> 00:32:19.679
Also in terms of a few keywords that you think
define your sense of who you are.

00:32:19.679 --> 00:32:27.570
And then you get to use the web cam built
into the kiosk, into the iPad, to actually

00:32:27.570 --> 00:32:30.650
answer that question and present that back
to the world.

00:32:30.650 --> 00:32:36.202
&gt;&gt;Hank: And this is yet another Google employee,
Bernardo Fernandez, was one of the first people

00:32:36.202 --> 00:32:40.630
to come and test out the mobile app, and was
actually impressed by it, which we felt like

00:32:40.630 --> 00:32:41.750
was a major achievement.

00:32:41.750 --> 00:32:49.860
And so what was really exciting about actually
having the opening is seeing on, literally

00:32:49.860 --> 00:32:53.360
dozens of people kind of crowd around this
installation.

00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:57.190
And the fact that it is a five channel, three
hour installation is something we never expected

00:32:57.190 --> 00:32:58.799
people to engage in on that level.

00:32:58.799 --> 00:33:02.740
We tried to make it something that people
could exit or enter at any point.

00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:07.710
We also made the education curriculum available
online.

00:33:07.710 --> 00:33:13.150
So people could download it and engage with
their family, friends, but also of course

00:33:13.150 --> 00:33:14.150
students.

00:33:14.150 --> 00:33:15.250
And then

00:33:15.250 --> 00:33:19.710
&gt;&gt;Chris: We should say that Kamal Sinclair,
our collaborator was really key in developing

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:21.250
that curriculum.

00:33:21.250 --> 00:33:29.670
&gt;&gt;Hank: and then these ideas, one of the things
that Chris really, was most moved by early

00:33:29.670 --> 00:33:34.400
on was this idea of this intergenerational
exchange.

00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.910
And I witnessed that very much watching him
and Bayete relate.

00:33:36.910 --> 00:33:40.059
Especially, I don't know, me and Bayete are
the same age.

00:33:40.059 --> 00:33:45.090
But there's this really amazing kind of way
which as black men, they have such different

00:33:45.090 --> 00:33:46.809
perspectives about things.

00:33:46.809 --> 00:33:52.870
And have the three of us having these kind
of different couldn't agree on what issues

00:33:52.870 --> 00:33:54.860
were central to black male identity.

00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.070
While we're doing this project about black
males.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:34:03.650
And so Chris, had this idea of why don't we
actually see what it's like to put this format

00:34:03.650 --> 00:34:05.429
to test in the public.

00:34:05.429 --> 00:34:09.520
Where we have this intergeneration exchange
where we had these things called blueprint

00:34:09.520 --> 00:34:10.520
round tables.

00:34:10.520 --> 00:34:11.520
[video starts]

00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.520
&gt;&gt;Male on video: I'm trying to figure out
the parameters of blackness.

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:13.520
[video stops]

00:34:13.520 --> 00:34:14.520
&gt;&gt;Hank: Whoa.

00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:15.520
Whoa.

00:34:15.520 --> 00:34:16.520
Oops.

00:34:16.520 --> 00:34:17.520
Sorry.

00:34:17.520 --> 00:34:18.520
I don't even know how that got in there.

00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:19.520
Oops.

00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:20.520
It was going so smoothly.

00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:21.520
[laughs]

00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:22.520
[audience laughs]

00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:24.260
Let me see if I can skip that particular clip.

00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:28.860
So this is a question that inspired this blueprint
roundtables.

00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:34.090
We had our last one on Saturday in Oakland
which was supposed to be just a two hour exchange

00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:37.800
which went on to be this four hour conversation
with hundreds of people that stayed.

00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:41.860
And the one at the Oakland Museum was very
moving.

00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:44.850
I got teary eyed, and it was pretty amazing.

00:34:44.850 --> 00:34:46.980
But this is the question that inspired that.

00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:52.669
[video starts]
&gt;&gt;Male #1: I love older people.

00:34:52.669 --> 00:34:55.520
I respect older people.

00:34:55.520 --> 00:34:59.080
I live for older people.

00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:04.060
'cause I come from somebody that's older.

00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:11.890
So first and foremost, I wanna say, we did
do wrong.

00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.880
We did things, we stuck on ourself.

00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:20.300
We did a lot of wrong things.

00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:21.300
You know.

00:35:21.300 --> 00:35:29.050
And for the most part, it's I don't respect
how you look down on us.

00:35:29.050 --> 00:35:30.300
You treat us a certain type of way.

00:35:30.300 --> 00:35:31.300
It's alright.

00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:32.300
We gonna do it for the next 30 years.

00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:33.300
We gonna show you all.

00:35:33.300 --> 00:35:34.300
We gonna do what we gotta do.

00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:35.300
But my whole thing is, my first and foremost.

00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.300
I should have just said this from the beginning,
but I'm gonna sum it up with this.

00:35:36.300 --> 00:35:37.300
Why didn't y'all leave us the blueprint?

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:38.300
Peace.

00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:42.790
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I suppose some of us, myself included,
feel like we did leave a blueprint.

00:35:42.790 --> 00:35:49.090
If you had experienced the euphoria that we
felt during the 60's,when we would see one

00:35:49.090 --> 00:35:53.480
another on a corner, and there wasn't no such
thing as you had to throw up some kinda gang

00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:54.480
sign.

00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.950
When you saw the black people, you weren't
like this, they weren't like that.

00:35:56.950 --> 00:35:57.950
Everything was just fine.

00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:00.910
That's not the way it is now.

00:36:00.910 --> 00:36:04.260
I thought, me as an individual 'cause I can't
speak to other people.

00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:08.910
I thought there would be a continuum, I thought
if I raised my children a certain way that

00:36:08.910 --> 00:36:10.660
things would stay that way.

00:36:10.660 --> 00:36:13.280
I thought that we were progressing.

00:36:13.280 --> 00:36:17.970
I underestimated the seriousness of our enemies.

00:36:17.970 --> 00:36:19.690
I underestimated them.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:26.660
That so much time and effort would be spent
in dismantling those things that brought about

00:36:26.660 --> 00:36:29.859
self-esteem, those things that brought about
self-love.

00:36:29.859 --> 00:36:32.430
Those things that brought about respect for
one another.

00:36:32.430 --> 00:36:37.340
A great deal of time and energy was spent
dismantling that.

00:36:37.340 --> 00:36:38.910
By our enemies.

00:36:38.910 --> 00:36:41.210
And it is our fault.

00:36:41.210 --> 00:36:44.570
That we did not see that for what it was.

00:36:44.570 --> 00:36:46.560
And combat it more thoroughly.

00:36:46.560 --> 00:36:52.200
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I think maybe we did leave you
a blueprint.

00:36:52.200 --> 00:37:03.120
And yet, we too were so busy trying to survive,
that we were not as organized and disciplined

00:37:03.120 --> 00:37:05.890
as maybe we should have been.

00:37:05.890 --> 00:37:11.250
But speaking from the platform of Martin Luther
King's civil right's movement.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:14.580
Martin Luther King never had more than 100
people on his staff.

00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:18.160
And that was only for one or two movements.

00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:24.520
He never had more than a half a million dollars
a year to try to change the world.

00:37:24.520 --> 00:37:27.010
None of us had a blueprint.

00:37:27.010 --> 00:37:40.170
But what he taught us to do and what we learned
from Gandhi in India, was that we could find

00:37:40.170 --> 00:37:45.020
our own way by standing up for the truth.

00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:53.030
&gt;&gt;Male #4 Well, after the civil rights movement
of the 60's proved to be very very successful,

00:37:53.030 --> 00:37:59.980
I think blacks felt that we have crossed a
threshold, and it's easy going from here on

00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980
in.

00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:04.620
But the worst was yet to come.

00:38:04.620 --> 00:38:10.750
I kinda think we thought that the waves would
continue to roll.

00:38:10.750 --> 00:38:14.750
And we did drop the ball.

00:38:14.750 --> 00:38:20.900
Only to find out later that other people were
making plans and were putting certain kinds

00:38:20.900 --> 00:38:25.090
of Negroes in heads of organizations and paying
them well.

00:38:25.090 --> 00:38:29.160
And they became the spokespersons for black
people.

00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:32.859
And they became the protectors of the plantation.

00:38:32.859 --> 00:38:34.460
Being paid by white people.

00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:39.650
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I think that we left you the blueprint,
we just didn't tell you where it was.

00:38:39.650 --> 00:38:41.090
It's there.

00:38:41.090 --> 00:38:44.400
But we didn't just show it to you or lay it
out.

00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:48.010
You had to look at us and see what we were
doing to find out.

00:38:48.010 --> 00:38:49.780
How to go about that blueprint.

00:38:49.780 --> 00:38:52.150
You see, some things can't be explained to
you.

00:38:52.150 --> 00:38:55.780
Some things you gotta look at a person and
then you gotta see what it is that they're

00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:56.780
doing.

00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:58.970
The blueprint is, you get an education.

00:38:58.970 --> 00:39:00.470
You don't just be in the middle of the road.

00:39:00.470 --> 00:39:02.660
You don't try to be with the kids who don't
do well.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:04.770
You try to be the best.

00:39:04.770 --> 00:39:05.770
OK?

00:39:05.770 --> 00:39:10.530
You do as good as you can, no matter how angry
people become when you're really good.

00:39:10.530 --> 00:39:11.530
You know, what?

00:39:11.530 --> 00:39:15.090
Success is not easy.

00:39:15.090 --> 00:39:16.190
It is not.

00:39:16.190 --> 00:39:19.920
If it was, everybody would be successful.

00:39:19.920 --> 00:39:21.930
It takes time.

00:39:21.930 --> 00:39:24.390
It takes hard work.

00:39:24.390 --> 00:39:27.580
And everybody's not geared for hard work.

00:39:27.580 --> 00:39:28.940
Some people want it overnight.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:31.250
And it's not gonna happen that way.

00:39:31.250 --> 00:39:36.080
So what you have to do it, we old people,
we've laid the groundwork for you.

00:39:36.080 --> 00:39:37.510
We've already put the blueprint out there.

00:39:37.510 --> 00:39:40.960
Now you might not like that blueprint.

00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.290
You might wanna alter it in some way.

00:39:43.290 --> 00:39:45.590
And you can.

00:39:45.590 --> 00:39:50.480
But if you alter it, and it's not for the
better, you will not achieve what us old folks

00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.450
have achieved.

00:39:53.450 --> 00:39:58.410
&gt;&gt; Chris: So again, you can imagine.

00:39:58.410 --> 00:40:00.690
You can see that what we're doing is, we're
telling a story.

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:05.000
We're allowing the men in this project to
tell the story.

00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:09.410
And in this case there was a hunger for an
intergenerational exchange that doesn't happen

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:13.359
when the men don't have fathers and grandfathers
who are there.

00:40:13.359 --> 00:40:18.800
And so this project becomes a vehicle for
talking between generations.

00:40:18.800 --> 00:40:20.520
[video starts]

00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.010
&gt;&gt;Male #6: I'm tryin' to figure out the parameters
of blackness.

00:40:26.010 --> 00:40:30.800
I know there's stuff that I'm supposed to
believe and read and listen to and look at

00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.400
if I'm definitely gonna be black.

00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:33.600
Like in a heart of blackness.

00:40:33.600 --> 00:40:38.640
But I keep wondering, Suppose for example
I prefer to listen to classical music?

00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:41.680
Or I prefer to travel to places where there
are no black people?

00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:46.250
Or I like Picasso maybe even more than I like
Romare Bearden or Jacob Lawrence.

00:40:46.250 --> 00:40:48.849
Am I still black?

00:40:48.849 --> 00:40:51.490
Or exactly how do we figure out where these
boundaries are.

00:40:51.490 --> 00:40:54.890
Or what we're supposed to be if we want to
be a part of this community?

00:40:54.890 --> 00:40:57.290
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Oh my God.

00:40:57.290 --> 00:41:01.440
I am so f---ing sick of regulatory blackness.

00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:05.080
Because this is what your question is all
about.

00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:08.050
What do I have to do in order to prove my
blackness.

00:41:08.050 --> 00:41:10.580
Let me just answer your question like this.

00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:16.020
I know I come from a rich tradition that is
diverse as it is deep.

00:41:16.020 --> 00:41:20.300
I don't have to do particular things in order
to prove that I'm more or less black.

00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:25.310
I mean, that's absolutely ridiculous and I
think it makes us schizophrenic.

00:41:25.310 --> 00:41:30.640
I think it makes us crazy to run around thinking,
well, if I don't listen to hip-hop, I'm not

00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:31.640
black enough.

00:41:31.640 --> 00:41:35.850
Um, if I go to rock concerts or something
like that, I'm being white.

00:41:35.850 --> 00:41:40.050
If I do this or if I do that, I'm not seen
as being a full black person in the black

00:41:40.050 --> 00:41:41.050
community.

00:41:41.050 --> 00:41:42.130
F--- that shit.

00:41:42.130 --> 00:41:43.130
I'm black.

00:41:43.130 --> 00:41:44.570
I'm proud of that.

00:41:44.570 --> 00:41:48.790
And I don't have to adhere to all these cultural
norms in order to prove that.

00:41:48.790 --> 00:41:53.970
&gt;&gt;Male #7: See, I've always believed in dealing
with different type of people.

00:41:53.970 --> 00:41:56.750
I never was set in stuck in like one type
of box.

00:41:56.750 --> 00:42:02.920
So, basically the answer for that is, like,
you can do basically whatever you wanna do.

00:42:02.920 --> 00:42:06.580
Just always remember that everything comes
from black.

00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:07.810
You know what I mean?

00:42:07.810 --> 00:42:11.349
So if like, you can deal with whoever you
wanna deal with.

00:42:11.349 --> 00:42:12.450
I like white people.

00:42:12.450 --> 00:42:14.050
I gotta few white friends.

00:42:14.050 --> 00:42:15.160
You know what I mean?

00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.570
And there's not nothin' wrong with that.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.940
It's your choice to do what you wanna do.

00:42:18.940 --> 00:42:26.830
But just always remember, try to rub off and
always try to take what you need to take from

00:42:26.830 --> 00:42:31.430
certain people and do what you need to do
with them, and create whatever you wanna create.

00:42:31.430 --> 00:42:32.430
Brothers.

00:42:32.430 --> 00:42:37.240
&gt;&gt;Hank: This is one of the more compelling
exchanges that we came across.

00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:42.869
Which I think when we heard this question,
I was, that was the first one when I was like

00:42:42.869 --> 00:42:48.200
OK, I think we've reached our, our stopping
point.

00:42:48.200 --> 00:42:52.070
Whereas, Chris decided to forge forward and
you kind of see where it led us.

00:42:52.070 --> 00:42:53.070

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:54.080
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Alright, cool, so this is my question.

00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.940
I've got a lot of brotha's in the hood, listenin'
to a lot of rap music.

00:42:57.940 --> 00:43:01.740
And I just wanna know, what is so cool about
selling crack?

00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:03.990
Cause someone tell me that.

00:43:03.990 --> 00:43:08.359
Why is that so glorified in the music and
the things that we talk about?

00:43:08.359 --> 00:43:14.440
&gt;&gt;Male #2: Well, for myself, when I came up
crack was a quick way for a black man to make

00:43:14.440 --> 00:43:15.440
a million dollas.

00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:16.880
I'm 40 years old.

00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:19.670
In '85 when the crack scene hit.

00:43:19.670 --> 00:43:22.830
I was 15, 16 years old.

00:43:22.830 --> 00:43:25.750
Watching two parents work dog hard to death.

00:43:25.750 --> 00:43:30.180
And watchin' the dude next door who was selling
crack ride big cars.

00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:32.430
To me, I thought that was cool.

00:43:32.430 --> 00:43:37.240
And once I learned how to sell crack, and
learned how to acquire my own money.

00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:41.560
And steal, learn how to have things white
folks was havin' and get up when I wanted

00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.020
to get up.

00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:44.320
To me, that was cool.

00:43:44.320 --> 00:43:47.210
&gt;&gt;Male #3: To me, crack is wack.

00:43:47.210 --> 00:43:52.730
But to most people I think, why to most people
my age and where I come from, my community,

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:56.589
I think it's cool because you could make money.

00:43:56.589 --> 00:44:01.500
You know, you could really just sit on your
butt and, you know, make some money.

00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:06.330
Don't really have to do nothin' except you
have to watch for cops and you be paranoid

00:44:06.330 --> 00:44:07.330
and everything.

00:44:07.330 --> 00:44:10.220
&gt;&gt;Male #4: Ain't nothing cool about being
up there.

00:44:10.220 --> 00:44:11.440
Taking life chances.

00:44:11.440 --> 00:44:13.060
Sitting on my corner.

00:44:13.060 --> 00:44:16.700
Not knowin' what's gonna occur at any given
minute.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:19.200
Tryin' to get some, what material possession.

00:44:19.200 --> 00:44:22.000
[coughing]
Ain't nuttin' cool out there.

00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.820
I mean, oppressing my people because I'm hurt.

00:44:24.820 --> 00:44:26.040
Hurt people hurt people.

00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:28.660
Ain't nuttin' cool with that.

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.830
Ain't nuttin cool with me sellin' crack to
my mama.

00:44:32.830 --> 00:44:35.980
Takin' the Christmas toys away from my little
siblings.

00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:39.310
'Cause I'm charging my mama a hunnred for
a dime on credit.

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:45.490
&gt;&gt;Male #3: I believe, like, sellin' drugs
is just, um, as much of an addiction as the

00:44:45.490 --> 00:44:46.750
person that is using it.

00:44:46.750 --> 00:44:48.130
You know, you see that money, you get a high.

00:44:48.130 --> 00:44:51.210
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I gotta answer for everything I
do.

00:44:51.210 --> 00:44:52.660
My actions and my inactions.

00:44:52.660 --> 00:44:55.869
And I've been a part of bullshit.

00:44:55.869 --> 00:45:01.410
And I didn't see it on the streets, I was
blinded to what, the delusion of grandeur.

00:45:01.410 --> 00:45:03.780
Thinkin that I'm greater than life itself.

00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:04.820
And I wasn't.

00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.820
you feelin' me?

00:45:05.820 --> 00:45:10.130
I'm responsible for hella hurt that I caused
people like broken families out there.

00:45:10.130 --> 00:45:13.880
I'm responsible for children that's incarcerated
right now as we speak.

00:45:13.880 --> 00:45:19.010
I'm incarcerated for death out there based
on me selling crack because I never know what

00:45:19.010 --> 00:45:21.339
a person had to do to go get it.

00:45:21.339 --> 00:45:22.339
You feelin' me?

00:45:22.339 --> 00:45:23.550
I'm responsible for that shit.

00:45:23.550 --> 00:45:24.780
Ain't nuttin cool with that.

00:45:24.780 --> 00:45:27.400
And at nighttime I sit and I sleep in my cell
man.

00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:29.510
And I sit there lost in thoughts man.

00:45:29.510 --> 00:45:30.510
Damn.

00:45:30.510 --> 00:45:44.820
I'm responsible for a lot of things.

00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:45.820
And um [sighs] Man.

00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:47.609
I ain't know why it's up for that.

00:45:47.609 --> 00:45:50.349
Just sitting here with the bullshit that I
created.

00:45:50.349 --> 00:45:54.089
Just sittin' here and watch my people sit
here and cry.

00:45:54.089 --> 00:45:55.560
I'm responsible for everything.

00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:57.359
I hold myself accountable.

00:45:57.359 --> 00:45:58.359
Shit.

00:45:58.359 --> 00:46:05.089
But I been committed suicide a long time ago
when I was a part of that bullshit.

00:46:05.089 --> 00:46:07.230
Now I claim my life.

00:46:07.230 --> 00:46:25.089
And I'm a part of something that's greater.

00:46:25.089 --> 00:46:26.089
And that's the solution.

00:46:26.089 --> 00:46:27.880
&gt;&gt;Chris: [sighs] So, again, you can imagine
what it was like to be in the presence of

00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:33.250
that kind of disclosure that came spontaneously
from this man just given an opportunity to

00:46:33.250 --> 00:46:34.250
do it.

00:46:34.250 --> 00:46:37.130
The same thing is true in this example here.

00:46:37.130 --> 00:46:38.700
We had no idea what this man was gonna ask.

00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:39.700
[video starts]

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.720
&gt;&gt;Male #1: This may seem like a silly question.

00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:44.719
I wanna know, am I the only one who has a
problem eat'n chicken, watermelon, and bananas

00:46:44.719 --> 00:46:46.180
in front of white people.

00:46:46.180 --> 00:46:49.680
[other men laugh and comment]

00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:55.460
&gt;&gt;Male #2: I don't have a problem with it.

00:46:55.460 --> 00:46:56.460
Period.

00:46:56.460 --> 00:46:59.200
&gt;&gt;Male #3: No, I'm gonna be honest with you.

00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:05.380
I don't even eat watermelon because of the
connotations that it has around black people.

00:47:05.380 --> 00:47:07.680
Um, but I will eat some chicken though.

00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:09.060
[men laugh]

00:47:09.060 --> 00:47:12.660
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I never heard the bananas one.

00:47:12.660 --> 00:47:13.859
I never heard.

00:47:13.859 --> 00:47:14.859
Bananas, really?

00:47:14.859 --> 00:47:21.000
&gt;&gt;Male #5: I don't know if you the only one,
but it's not a problem for me to eat whatever

00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.540
I wanna eat in front 'a anybody.

00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.520
&gt;&gt;Male #6: you're not the only one brother,
to be honest.

00:47:27.520 --> 00:47:30.310
Every time I still eat chicken.

00:47:30.310 --> 00:47:32.260
I eat a lot of watermelon.

00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:34.120
And I love bananas.

00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:35.520
But I'm always lookin' over my shoulder.

00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:40.840
Wherever I'm at, seein' who's watching me
eat this watermelon and this piece of chicken.

00:47:40.840 --> 00:47:42.350
And this banana.

00:47:42.350 --> 00:47:43.350
Always.

00:47:43.350 --> 00:47:44.350
You not the only one.

00:47:44.350 --> 00:47:51.810
&gt;&gt;Male #7: No, I know plenty of African Americans
who as a rule will not eat watermelon in front

00:47:51.810 --> 00:47:53.070
of white folks.

00:47:53.070 --> 00:48:00.050
Now, for me, I've difficulty relating to the
question only in the sense that I've never

00:48:00.050 --> 00:48:01.760
ever liked watermelon.

00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:02.760
[laughter]

00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:04.140
And I don't eat meat.

00:48:04.140 --> 00:48:10.589
So I don't find myself in the situation [laughs]
where chicken and watermelon comes to a head.

00:48:10.589 --> 00:48:18.010
But I do know that there are times where you
feel like you are the stereotype.

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:23.120
Because you know, if they say "Hey do you
wanna go play some basketball?"

00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:24.760
And of course I love basketball.

00:48:24.760 --> 00:48:27.099
I played it every single day.

00:48:27.099 --> 00:48:28.910
But there's a part of me that wants to say
"Nah.

00:48:28.910 --> 00:48:31.050
I don't wanna play any basketball.

00:48:31.050 --> 00:48:33.980
What makes you think I wanna play basketball?"

00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:39.550
But in those moments, I think we have to be
honest with ourselves.

00:48:39.550 --> 00:48:42.920
And just know that there are some things that
are true.

00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:43.920
Yes.

00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:44.920
You know.

00:48:44.920 --> 00:48:45.920
We like chicken.

00:48:45.920 --> 00:48:46.920
We like watermelon.

00:48:46.920 --> 00:48:48.609
And there's nothin' wrong with that and it's
nothin' to be ashamed of.

00:48:48.609 --> 00:48:51.240
&gt;&gt;Male #8: it's not a silly question brother.

00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:58.060
My family sells 50,000 pounds of watermelon
every week in the streets of South Chicago,

00:48:58.060 --> 00:48:59.619
Milwaukee, and Gary, Indiana.

00:48:59.619 --> 00:49:01.170
And have been since 1953.

00:49:01.170 --> 00:49:02.990
And we're OK with that.

00:49:02.990 --> 00:49:06.500
[laughter]
And by the way, I like fried chicken.

00:49:06.500 --> 00:49:07.510
'Fact, I'm gonna make some tonight.

00:49:07.510 --> 00:49:10.880
&gt;&gt;Male #9: I don't know if you're the only
one ashamed.

00:49:10.880 --> 00:49:16.829
I'm not ashamed, but I do give chicken a second
thought sometimes.

00:49:16.829 --> 00:49:17.980
Even when I mention it.

00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.410
But I always pass it off as sort of like in
a jokey joke way.

00:49:22.410 --> 00:49:24.230
'Cause I do love chicken.

00:49:24.230 --> 00:49:25.230
Watermelon.

00:49:25.230 --> 00:49:27.630
I don't eat watermelon so much.

00:49:27.630 --> 00:49:31.630
So I'm not really so much ashamed of it.

00:49:31.630 --> 00:49:36.240
Bananas, I hadn't thought about bananas because
I was always thinking about banana, because

00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:37.780
I'm gay in a sexual way.

00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:43.280
So when I put a banana, I'm always self conscious
in front of anybody.

00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:45.050
Just because, sexuality.

00:49:45.050 --> 00:49:46.839
But not because of race.

00:49:46.839 --> 00:49:47.839
[laughter]

00:49:47.839 --> 00:49:51.470
&gt;&gt;Male #10: I thin really the question leads
to a deeper question.

00:49:51.470 --> 00:49:54.820
Why are we so concerned what they think about
us?

00:49:54.820 --> 00:49:56.960
I mean, you know, that's what the real question
is.

00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.359
I don't really care.

00:49:58.359 --> 00:50:03.590
You know, I know somewhere in there, I do
care, but in my consciousness and what I'm

00:50:03.590 --> 00:50:06.320
gonna say is, I don't really care what they
think.

00:50:06.320 --> 00:50:11.400
You know, I don't need their approval in order
for me to go ahead and be me.

00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.400
Or for me to do my job.

00:50:13.400 --> 00:50:16.109
You know, or for me to be who I'm gonna be.

00:50:16.109 --> 00:50:17.619
I don't need their approval.

00:50:17.619 --> 00:50:18.940
I don't need their jaw.

00:50:18.940 --> 00:50:20.310
None of that.

00:50:20.310 --> 00:50:26.030
You know, I think it's' really important that
we stop worrying about what they think and

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.210
start worrying about what you think about
yourself.

00:50:28.210 --> 00:50:31.520
And maybe what the little black kid next door
to you thinks about you.

00:50:31.520 --> 00:50:34.730
F--- some white person thinkin' about what
they think about you eatin' a watermelon or

00:50:34.730 --> 00:50:35.730
anything else.

00:50:35.730 --> 00:50:37.690
Your shoes, your jacket.

00:50:37.690 --> 00:50:39.170
Your hat backwards.

00:50:39.170 --> 00:50:43.359
I don't go with the saggin' pants but you
know, whatever you do.

00:50:43.359 --> 00:50:48.200
And that's because it's your cultural identity
or your food or whatever.

00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.950
What they think about it is not really important.

00:50:50.950 --> 00:50:55.750
&gt;&gt;Hank: So this is, and you saw that exchange
between the heaviness of the crack questions

00:50:55.750 --> 00:51:00.290
and kind of the, I think the, we have so many
other, my favorite answer to that particular

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:02.040
question isn't even in here.

00:51:02.040 --> 00:51:06.550
Because we had, there's so many different
kind of answers and what we found is everyone

00:51:06.550 --> 00:51:08.300
is an expert about something.

00:51:08.300 --> 00:51:13.750
Everyone like, we found this guy who said
my family's sold watermelons for 60 years.

00:51:13.750 --> 00:51:19.240
You know, like these are the kind of things
that lie beneath, in every one of us in this

00:51:19.240 --> 00:51:23.180
room there's all these things that we don't
ever think about how they relate, how we relate

00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:24.940
to one another.

00:51:24.940 --> 00:51:29.460
I'm gonna skip this one.

00:51:29.460 --> 00:51:34.170
And then show you this clip and then we're
gonna pretty soon wrap up.

00:51:34.170 --> 00:51:35.170
[video starts]

00:51:35.170 --> 00:51:37.510
&gt;&gt;Boy: I have a question.

00:51:37.510 --> 00:51:40.109
How do you know when you become a man?

00:51:40.109 --> 00:51:46.110
&gt;&gt;Male #1: Wow, that's deep question for such
a young person.

00:51:46.110 --> 00:51:48.990
How would you know when you become a man.

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:51.200
Well, basically, responsibility.

00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.720
You're able to take on assume responsibility.

00:51:54.720 --> 00:52:01.079
Hold fast to your commitments to yourself
first, your family and the community of which

00:52:01.079 --> 00:52:02.079
you live in.

00:52:02.079 --> 00:52:07.470
And if you can do those things, you're on
your way to manhood.

00:52:07.470 --> 00:52:11.450
&gt;&gt;Male #2: The question of when you become
a man, you're born a man.

00:52:11.450 --> 00:52:14.590
When you become of age, may be a more relevant
question.

00:52:14.590 --> 00:52:20.750
But some of us become of age, many many times
throughout the course of their lives.

00:52:20.750 --> 00:52:30.119
I thought that I was a man at 21, ready to
write memoirs of all my experience.

00:52:30.119 --> 00:52:31.119
You know.

00:52:31.119 --> 00:52:33.780
And so I don't know how many times that I
thought I knew the answer to everything.

00:52:33.780 --> 00:52:35.010
And so I'm here again [laughs] thinking that
I know it all.

00:52:35.010 --> 00:52:36.010
But you, you'll know.

00:52:36.010 --> 00:52:38.000
&gt;&gt;Male #3: Young man, there are a couple of
different factors that make you a man.

00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:41.740
You have to be financially stable.

00:52:41.740 --> 00:52:43.320
That's one.

00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:48.810
You definitely got to have your own place.

00:52:48.810 --> 00:52:52.730
Own roof over your head.

00:52:52.730 --> 00:52:57.430
You have to go to college.

00:52:57.430 --> 00:53:03.320
You know that's for all the young men out
there.

00:53:03.320 --> 00:53:10.880
That's one step that you gotta take in order
to lead to financial stability.

00:53:10.880 --> 00:53:14.200
And you have to be taking care of yourself.

00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:16.370
And buy your mama a house.

00:53:16.370 --> 00:53:18.190
Then you become a man.

00:53:18.190 --> 00:53:19.190
[laughter]

00:53:19.190 --> 00:53:23.330
&gt;&gt;Male #4: I think sometimes, I still try
to answer that question, whether or not I've

00:53:23.330 --> 00:53:24.970
become a man.

00:53:24.970 --> 00:53:29.220
I grew up in a single family home without
a father.

00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:35.600
But I'm the youngest of seven and I have six
older brothers who taught me about being a

00:53:35.600 --> 00:53:36.600
man.

00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:40.540
And so part of that is trying to be responsible
to my family.

00:53:40.540 --> 00:53:42.740
And to my loved ones.

00:53:42.740 --> 00:53:45.020
And being a responsible citizen.

00:53:45.020 --> 00:53:49.640
But I think each of us have to find our own
way to that path.

00:53:49.640 --> 00:53:51.550
Of what it means to be a man.

00:53:51.550 --> 00:54:01.339
&gt;&gt;Male #5: Young brother, it, you know, I
knew I became a man when I had to take on

00:54:01.339 --> 00:54:02.820
certain responsibilities and obligations with
family, community and otherwise.

00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:04.960
&gt;&gt;Male #6: Oh, that's a fine question there.

00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:10.180
I think that one of the mistakes that we often
make is thinking that the first time that

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.580
we're intimate with a woman, that now we're
a man.

00:54:13.580 --> 00:54:19.940
In traditional societies, in order for boys
to go into manhood, they had to go through

00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:26.100
certain rituals which included them being
prepared to fit whatever role they had in

00:54:26.100 --> 00:54:27.100
that society.

00:54:27.100 --> 00:54:29.369
If they were hunters, they'd learn how to
hunt.

00:54:29.369 --> 00:54:32.300
If they were farmers, they'd learn how to
farm.

00:54:32.300 --> 00:54:34.329
If they were fishermen, they learned how to
fish.

00:54:34.329 --> 00:54:38.630
And when they were through with everything
that prepared them to be a responsible member

00:54:38.630 --> 00:54:43.720
of that particular community and that particular
town or village or tribe or whatever, they

00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:46.580
were given visible symbols of their completion.

00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:52.490
A scar on the face, a type of clothing, a
type of jewelry or something that they wore

00:54:52.490 --> 00:54:56.470
that a woman could look at them and say "Well
this person is now a man."

00:54:56.470 --> 00:54:57.630
&gt;&gt;Male #7: Young'un, Young'un.

00:54:57.630 --> 00:54:58.630
Hooo.

00:54:58.630 --> 00:55:02.560
I'm still tryin' to figure that out myself.

00:55:02.560 --> 00:55:06.920
Um, it's, it's tough.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:09.080
It's really tough.

00:55:09.080 --> 00:55:16.000
I just for me, I really don't know when that's
gonna happen.

00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:23.910
Right now I'm just trying to take these strides
in what society thinks a man is, you know.

00:55:23.910 --> 00:55:29.270
Going to school and getting a job, and being
able to stand on my two feet.

00:55:29.270 --> 00:55:31.550
It's gonna be a difficult road.

00:55:31.550 --> 00:55:37.710
But It's probably gonna be well worth it.

00:55:37.710 --> 00:55:41.350
&gt;&gt;Hank: So, we have all of this content.

00:55:41.350 --> 00:55:45.380
We have actually more than 1500, we have almost
2000 now, question answer exchanges.

00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:50.670
And so we worked with Ryan Alexiev, who's
here also today to kind of start to, he also

00:55:50.670 --> 00:55:51.750
designed our iPad app.

00:55:51.750 --> 00:55:55.204
And we have a beta form of a mobile app that
we did with InnoVent.

00:55:55.204 --> 00:56:00.190
But the main thing that we're really hoping
to get to as engagement energies are these

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:03.910
posters that we can distribute and a lot of
people using QR codes and

00:56:03.910 --> 00:56:04.910
&gt;&gt;Chris: NFC tags.

00:56:04.910 --> 00:56:10.750
&gt;&gt;Hank: NFC tags to actually respond to questions
from their mobile devices.

00:56:10.750 --> 00:56:17.130
But also to log onto our website which we
hope someday soon will be user generated.

00:56:17.130 --> 00:56:21.230
Where you can kind of look at questions, upload
your own answers to questions and then have

00:56:21.230 --> 00:56:27.760
these different ways of searching questions
and answers through this integrated identity

00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:28.760
map.

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:36.089
As well as a map based on what kind of values
people are kind of representing.

00:56:36.089 --> 00:56:37.610
Through locations, and things like that.

00:56:37.610 --> 00:56:42.609
And then lastly just using the slide of one
of Bayete Ross Smith, one of our collaborator's

00:56:42.609 --> 00:56:43.609
work.

00:56:43.609 --> 00:56:49.440
To show kind of how our hopefully we, our
ultimate goal of the Question Bridge will

00:56:49.440 --> 00:56:55.900
lead to showing that within each individual
is a much more complex and diverse human being

00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:02.240
that no one could be deduced to a simple demographic
stereotype or notion.

00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.030
&gt;&gt;Chris: one of the ways that we symbolize
that is by emphasizing that the title of this

00:57:06.030 --> 00:57:09.030
project is Question Bridge, colon, Black Males.

00:57:09.030 --> 00:57:10.430
The colon is really important.

00:57:10.430 --> 00:57:14.619
There really is no reason why this methodology
couldn't be applied to any demographic.

00:57:14.619 --> 00:57:15.800
And that's one of our aspirations.

00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:20.740
&gt;&gt;Hank: Especially when it's not even race
or gender specific.

00:57:20.740 --> 00:57:21.740
Question Bridge Google.

00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:22.740
&gt;&gt;Chris: So thank you.

00:57:22.740 --> 00:57:23.740
[laughter]

00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:24.740
&gt;&gt;Hank: Thank you all.

00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:25.740
[applause]

00:57:25.740 --> 00:57:34.930
&gt;&gt;Stacy: Feel free to ask questions with the
mic.

00:57:34.930 --> 00:57:47.589
&gt;&gt;Audience Member #1: So I, your project is
a fascinating amalgam of psychology and sociology

00:57:47.589 --> 00:57:57.690
and politics and art and I guess my question
is about the artistic and the maybe political

00:57:57.690 --> 00:58:00.260
part.

00:58:00.260 --> 00:58:01.400
Or anthropological part.

00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:02.400
I don't know.

00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:10.930
But as the people doing the selection curation
of this material, and deciding how to present

00:58:10.930 --> 00:58:16.849
it and which parts of it to present to the
people who interact with it or, and become

00:58:16.849 --> 00:58:21.990
a part of the project, in that way or to the
people who maybe go to the Oakland Museum

00:58:21.990 --> 00:58:24.200
and view the installation.

00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:31.560
Obviously you bring some biases very openly
to your selection process and you've articulated

00:58:31.560 --> 00:58:32.560
some of them.

00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:36.790
Like there's value in the diversity of this
demographic.

00:58:36.790 --> 00:58:45.510
And I'm sure you probably have a very conscious
awareness of the role that your biases play

00:58:45.510 --> 00:58:49.000
in the selection of this stuff.

00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:55.250
And which parts are you gonna emphasize, which
are the interesting parts.

00:58:55.250 --> 00:58:59.650
I'm interested in your comments about how
do you decide which are the right biases to

00:58:59.650 --> 00:59:04.599
apply in choosing the material?

00:59:04.599 --> 00:59:06.960
And which ones are the ones that you might
try to suppress?

00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:13.349
&gt;&gt; Chris Johnson: Well, I think the essence
of that goes back to the fact that as I said

00:59:13.349 --> 00:59:19.770
at the beginning of this, this is a project
that even though it does share methodologies

00:59:19.770 --> 00:59:28.410
and values that anthropology, sociology, psychology
does, journalism, for example.

00:59:28.410 --> 00:59:34.810
All of those are pursuits of truth, but because
it's a work of art, what drives all those

00:59:34.810 --> 00:59:38.670
decisions are, first of all, the initial experience
that we feel like we wanna convey.

00:59:38.670 --> 00:59:40.430
I mean, that's primary.

00:59:40.430 --> 00:59:47.640
And because the initial experience of this
is our experience as black men, our understanding

00:59:47.640 --> 00:59:51.400
of how complex we are as individuals.

00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:57.780
Our experience of the fact that because we
are marginalized, I use the notion of us being

00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:58.780
opaque.

00:59:58.780 --> 01:00:04.720
That the mission of this as artists is to
have visibility.

01:00:04.720 --> 01:00:05.770
For those black men.

01:00:05.770 --> 01:00:09.790
And so what we wanna do is listen very carefully
to the stories that emerge.

01:00:09.790 --> 01:00:17.670
And then sense where there's an implied narrative
arc, like where the meaning lies by the juxtaposition

01:00:17.670 --> 01:00:19.589
and sequencing of these questions.

01:00:19.589 --> 01:00:22.410
And you can see that in the sequences.

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:25.480
So you make those decisions intuitively.

01:00:25.480 --> 01:00:31.560
Hoping you're creating an experience that
becomes an exchange between us as artists

01:00:31.560 --> 01:00:33.130
and you as viewers.

01:00:33.130 --> 01:00:37.430
And then you use formal strategies, of course
the framing.

01:00:37.430 --> 01:00:40.690
And I talked a little bit about the way the
installation is designed.

01:00:40.690 --> 01:00:42.599
You know try to be inclusive.

01:00:42.599 --> 01:00:47.250
Those are all things that are driven by our
sensibilities as artists.

01:00:47.250 --> 01:00:52.220
And then we hope that experience is transformative
for the viewers.

01:00:52.220 --> 01:00:57.100
&gt;&gt;Hank: Well, I agree with him to a degree.

01:00:57.100 --> 01:01:03.400
I think one of the things he didn't mention
'cause he's being diplomatic is, we argue.

01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:10.470
[chuckles] Because it's a collaboration and
it's a collaboration and the making of a five

01:01:10.470 --> 01:01:15.589
channel, three hour project, you have, we
have like six or seven voices involved.

01:01:15.589 --> 01:01:18.210
And not all of them are African American males.

01:01:18.210 --> 01:01:22.010
And we each have different subjects.

01:01:22.010 --> 01:01:25.630
Different people who, like this is, I love
this person or I love that person.

01:01:25.630 --> 01:01:30.740
And I think part of the reason that its' also,
it becomes more complex is because no one

01:01:30.740 --> 01:01:33.750
single vision is defining this conversation.

01:01:33.750 --> 01:01:36.950
We're very sensitive to that aspect.

01:01:36.950 --> 01:01:41.640
The only reason its' even three hours is because
we didn't have time to make it six hours.

01:01:41.640 --> 01:01:45.980
Because we have over 85 hours of like really
great content.

01:01:45.980 --> 01:01:49.910
And I think, you know, if Chris were left
to his own devices.

01:01:49.910 --> 01:01:54.930
If I was left, I'd make it one thing, and
that's, I think this project, one of the things

01:01:54.930 --> 01:01:59.980
that it really tries to challenge is this
idea of an authoritative narrative voice.

01:01:59.980 --> 01:02:04.400
That within especially social sciences says,
I have an expert from the outside that's gonna

01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:11.950
come in and apply these generic kind of format
to finding out information about a certain

01:02:11.950 --> 01:02:12.950
group.

01:02:12.950 --> 01:02:14.589
Whereas our project is really organic.

01:02:14.589 --> 01:02:17.530
you know, Chris will walk up to somebody on
the street.

01:02:17.530 --> 01:02:19.400
Or Bayete will call somebody in another place.

01:02:19.400 --> 01:02:21.990
Or Kamal will say, oh I happen to know.

01:02:21.990 --> 01:02:24.380
Everybody happens to know some black man somewhere.

01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:28.050
So the diversity is implied in the way that
we find people.

01:02:28.050 --> 01:02:34.170
And then we show them questions and when we
first, Chris asked them to pose a question

01:02:34.170 --> 01:02:40.579
and they would give a question and the bias
was in me, Chris, and Bayete's selection of

01:02:40.579 --> 01:02:44.730
question we showed them based off the question
they asked.

01:02:44.730 --> 01:02:49.270
&gt;&gt;Chris: But let me just give a further answer.

01:02:49.270 --> 01:02:54.829
What emerged as Hank said, was in a sense,
a synthesis of two key things.

01:02:54.829 --> 01:02:56.099
One of them had to do with healing.

01:02:56.099 --> 01:03:02.339
And so you heard me talk about how the project
was for me a chance to try to create a connection

01:03:02.339 --> 01:03:05.820
between these different segments of the African
American community.

01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.660
Who for historical reasons were separated
and needed each other.

01:03:09.660 --> 01:03:15.200
So that one has a sense of empowerment and
freedom to move through opportunities and

01:03:15.200 --> 01:03:16.260
the greater world.

01:03:16.260 --> 01:03:19.620
Others have a strong sense of community, belonging
to each other.

01:03:19.620 --> 01:03:21.839
And so, wanting to heal that.

01:03:21.839 --> 01:03:23.400
So healing became one theme.

01:03:23.400 --> 01:03:26.730
And that could have been the driving force
behind the whole project.

01:03:26.730 --> 01:03:28.690
But another one emerged that was really important.

01:03:28.690 --> 01:03:31.099
And that is representation.

01:03:31.099 --> 01:03:37.589
The opportunity of black men through this
format to speak and define themselves.

01:03:37.589 --> 01:03:41.880
Without an author telling them what to say,
and how to say it.

01:03:41.880 --> 01:03:46.900
And so those dynamics played out even within
a particular sequence.

01:03:46.900 --> 01:03:52.070
And that's what gives it such depth and richness,
I think.

01:03:52.070 --> 01:03:53.070
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #1: Thank you.

01:03:53.070 --> 01:03:54.420
&gt;&gt;Male audience member #2: I just have a quick
question.

01:03:54.420 --> 01:03:56.740
Do you guys ever film reactions?

01:03:56.740 --> 01:04:02.460
When they hear like 15 different answers,
like how their opinions might have changed

01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.460
after that.

01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:05.730
&gt;&gt;Hank: you wanna take that?

01:04:05.730 --> 01:04:07.260
&gt;&gt;Chris: Well, sure.

01:04:07.260 --> 01:04:15.300
As you can imagine part of the process entails
filming the person while they're listening

01:04:15.300 --> 01:04:16.750
to the question.

01:04:16.750 --> 01:04:17.750
Sometimes that's really important.

01:04:17.750 --> 01:04:22.130
And the way that would work, this is something
Hank and I did sort of telepathically.

01:04:22.130 --> 01:04:26.690
He would give me a cue that this question
is gonna prompt a response.

01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:29.359
And I would be really careful to capture that.

01:04:29.359 --> 01:04:33.190
And then you could see how we used some of
that footage.

01:04:33.190 --> 01:04:35.089
The headers.

01:04:35.089 --> 01:04:36.849
In and out of a question.

01:04:36.849 --> 01:04:41.090
As a way to create a dynamic of exchange in
the installation.

01:04:41.090 --> 01:04:44.720
And so we definitely captured as much of that
as possible.

01:04:44.720 --> 01:04:53.250
But one technical thing, working in digital
video, you become very mindful of disc space.

01:04:53.250 --> 01:05:00.619
So we sometimes would see things running out
and so we more, conservative about what we

01:05:00.619 --> 01:05:01.619
captured.

01:05:01.619 --> 01:05:02.619
But yeah, that was part of it.

01:05:02.619 --> 01:05:03.619
That was part of it.

01:05:03.619 --> 01:05:05.480
&gt;&gt;Hank: But also one of the factors of Chris's
original question for this project.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:11.820
I wish we had the time to do, was to take
certain, and Chris especially has ambition,

01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:16.349
a mission, to go back and find the man who
asked the peaceful question.

01:05:16.349 --> 01:05:20.450
And show him the range of answers we got to
that question.

01:05:20.450 --> 01:05:23.900
And I think the, basically a rebuttal.

01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:25.190
That that was part, you did.

01:05:25.190 --> 01:05:26.190
&gt;&gt;Chris: Closing the loop.

01:05:26.190 --> 01:05:27.190
&gt;&gt;Hank: Closing the loop.

01:05:27.190 --> 01:05:31.170
And the original Question Bridge project that
we haven't really had a chance because we

01:05:31.170 --> 01:05:32.380
have to track down these 160 men.

01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.380
But we will.

01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:39.780
&gt;&gt;Female audience member: On that note, thank
you very much for coming to Google today.

01:05:39.780 --> 01:05:40.780
