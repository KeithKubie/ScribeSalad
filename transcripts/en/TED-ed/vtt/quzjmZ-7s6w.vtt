00:00:07.236 --> 00:00:10.875
Stretched across a tree-peppered expanse
in southern Africa

00:00:10.875 --> 00:00:14.765
lies the magnificent ruins
of Great Zimbabwe,

00:00:14.765 --> 00:00:19.186
a medieval stone city of astounding
wealth and prestige.

00:00:19.186 --> 00:00:21.767
Located in the present-day country
of Zimbabwe,

00:00:21.767 --> 00:00:26.475
it's the sight of the largest known
settlement ruins in Sub-Saharan Africa,

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:30.306
second on the continent only
to the pyramids of Egypt.

00:00:30.306 --> 00:00:33.556
But the history of this city
is shrouded in controversy,

00:00:33.556 --> 00:00:38.867
defined by decades of dispute
about who built it and why.

00:00:38.867 --> 00:00:42.213
Its name comes from the Shona word
madzimbabwe,

00:00:42.213 --> 00:00:44.733
meaning big house of stone

00:00:44.733 --> 00:00:49.312
for its unscalable stone walls
that reach heights of nearly ten meters

00:00:49.312 --> 00:00:53.355
and run for a length of about 250 meters.

00:00:53.355 --> 00:00:55.771
For its grandeur 
and historical significance,

00:00:55.771 --> 00:01:01.144
it was named a UNESCO 
World Heritage site in 1986.

00:01:01.144 --> 00:01:05.613
Back in the 14th and 15th centuries,
it was a thriving city.

00:01:05.613 --> 00:01:08.144
Spread across nearly eight 
square-kilometers,

00:01:08.144 --> 00:01:11.446
Great Zimbabwe was defined by
three main areas:

00:01:11.446 --> 00:01:13.894
the Hill Complex, where the king lived;

00:01:13.894 --> 00:01:17.544
the Great Enclosure, reserved for
members of the royal family;

00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:21.986
and the Valley Complex, 
where regular citizens lived.

00:01:21.986 --> 00:01:27.640
Rulers were both powerful economic
and religious leaders for the region.

00:01:27.640 --> 00:01:29.055
At its highest point,

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:32.705
the city had a bustling urban population 
of 18,000 people

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:36.905
and was one of the major African 
trade centers at the time.

00:01:36.905 --> 00:01:40.290
What enabled this growth 
was Great Zimbabwe's influential role

00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:43.557
in an intercontinental trade network.

00:01:43.557 --> 00:01:48.201
Connected to several key city-states
along the East African Swahili Coast,

00:01:48.201 --> 00:01:51.791
it was part of the larger Indian Ocean
trade routes.

00:01:51.791 --> 00:01:55.274
The city generated its riches 
by controlling the sources and trade

00:01:55.274 --> 00:01:57.385
of the most prized items:

00:01:57.385 --> 00:01:58.406
gold,

00:01:58.406 --> 00:01:59.272
ivory,

00:01:59.272 --> 00:02:00.897
and copper.

00:02:00.897 --> 00:02:04.816
With this mercantile power, it was able
to extend its sphere of influence

00:02:04.816 --> 00:02:06.356
across continents,

00:02:06.356 --> 00:02:12.477
fostering a strong Arab and Indian
trader presence throughout its zenith.

00:02:12.477 --> 00:02:16.200
Archaeologists have since pieced together
the details of this history

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.957
through artifacts discovered on site.

00:02:18.957 --> 00:02:21.800
There were pottery shards
and glassworks from Asia,

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.287
as well as coins minted in the coastal
trading city of Kilwa Kisiwani

00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:28.597
over 1,500 miles away.

00:02:28.597 --> 00:02:30.707
They also found soapstone bird figures,

00:02:30.707 --> 00:02:34.266
which are thought to represent
each of the city's rulers,

00:02:34.266 --> 00:02:37.908
and young calf bones,
only unearthed near the royal residence,

00:02:37.908 --> 00:02:42.627
show how the diet of the elite
differed from the general population.

00:02:42.627 --> 00:02:47.427
These clues have also led to theories
about the city's decline.

00:02:47.427 --> 00:02:49.327
By the mid-15th century,

00:02:49.327 --> 00:02:53.867
the buildings at Great Zimbabwe
were almost all that remained.

00:02:53.867 --> 00:02:56.238
Archaeological evidence points
to overcrowding

00:02:56.238 --> 00:02:58.908
and sanitation issues as the cause,

00:02:58.908 --> 00:03:02.488
compounded by soil depletion
triggered by overuse.

00:03:02.488 --> 00:03:06.149
Eventually, as crops withered
and conditions in the city worsened,

00:03:06.149 --> 00:03:09.477
the population of Great Zimbabwe
is thought to have dispersed

00:03:09.477 --> 00:03:13.938
and formed the nearby Mutapa
and Torwa states.

00:03:13.938 --> 00:03:16.998
Centuries later, a new phase
of Great Zimbabwe's influence

00:03:16.998 --> 00:03:19.509
began to play out in the political realm

00:03:19.509 --> 00:03:22.849
as people debated who had built
the famous city of stone.

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:25.878
During the European 
colonization of Africa,

00:03:25.878 --> 00:03:30.589
racist colonial officials claimed 
the ruins couldn't be of African origin.

00:03:30.589 --> 00:03:33.200
So, without a detailed written 
record on hand,

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.484
they instead relied on myths to explain
the magnificence of Great Zimbabwe.

00:03:38.484 --> 00:03:41.550
Some claimed it proved the Bible
story of the Queen of Sheba

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:43.720
who lived in a city of riches.

00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.550
Others argued it was built by
the Ancient Greeks.

00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:51.770
Then, in the early 20th century
after extensive excavation at the site,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.581
the archaeologist David Randall-MacIver

00:03:54.581 --> 00:03:57.149
presented clear evidence 
that Great Zimbabwe

00:03:57.149 --> 00:03:59.930
was built by indigenous peoples.

00:03:59.930 --> 00:04:03.250
Yet, at the time, the country's white 
minority colonial government

00:04:03.250 --> 00:04:08.742
sought to discredit this theory because it
challenged the legitimacy of their rule.

00:04:08.742 --> 00:04:11.589
In fact, the government actively
encouraged historians

00:04:11.589 --> 00:04:16.861
to produce accounts that disputed
the city's African origins.

00:04:16.861 --> 00:04:20.711
Over time, however, an overwhelming
body of evidence mounted,

00:04:20.711 --> 00:04:26.961
identifying Great Zimbabwe as an African
city built by Africans.

00:04:26.961 --> 00:04:29.112
During the 1960s and 70s,

00:04:29.112 --> 00:04:33.211
Great Zimbabwe became an important symbol 
for the African Nationalist movement

00:04:33.211 --> 00:04:35.991
that was spreading across the continent.

00:04:35.991 --> 00:04:38.191
Today, the ruins at Great Zimbabwe,

00:04:38.191 --> 00:04:41.873
alluded to on the Zimbabwean flag
by a soapstone bird,

00:04:41.873 --> 00:04:45.452
still stand as a source of national pride
and cultural value.
