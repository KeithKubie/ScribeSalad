00:00:00.317 --> 00:00:01.454
- [Voiceover] Let's get a little practice

00:00:01.454 --> 00:00:02.905
doing the Khan Academy exercise

00:00:02.905 --> 00:00:05.833
Marking Data on Line Plots.

00:00:06.174 --> 00:00:07.234
So right over here it says,

00:00:07.234 --> 00:00:08.514
"Tessa measured the distance

00:00:08.514 --> 00:00:10.414
"from her house to several locations

00:00:10.414 --> 00:00:13.877
"to the nearest half kilometer."

00:00:14.297 --> 00:00:16.317
All right, and so they
have different locations

00:00:16.317 --> 00:00:19.137
and it tells us the
distance from her house

00:00:19.137 --> 00:00:20.457
to each of these locations.

00:00:20.457 --> 00:00:23.247
So from her house to the
school is 3 1/2 kilometers,

00:00:23.247 --> 00:00:25.148
from the library is 5 1/2 kilometers,

00:00:25.148 --> 00:00:26.630
to the park is two kilometers,

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:28.588
the movie theater is four kilometers,

00:00:28.588 --> 00:00:30.998
to the post office, 5 1/2 kilometers.

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:32.832
Then they ask us, "How many dots

00:00:32.832 --> 00:00:34.768
"should be on a line plot
of these measurements?"

00:00:34.768 --> 00:00:37.763
So a line plot, and
they have one down here,

00:00:38.071 --> 00:00:40.128
a line plot, this is
literally a number line

00:00:40.128 --> 00:00:42.078
and what we do is we put

00:00:42.078 --> 00:00:43.629
as many dots there are

00:00:43.629 --> 00:00:46.574
at a certain point in the line.

00:00:46.574 --> 00:00:48.546
So if we have two data points at 5 1/2

00:00:48.546 --> 00:00:51.044
we would put two dots right over there,

00:00:51.044 --> 00:00:52.488
but we'll get to that in a second.

00:00:52.965 --> 00:00:54.925
They're just asking us how many dots

00:00:54.925 --> 00:00:56.885
should be on the line plot
of these measurements?

00:00:56.885 --> 00:00:58.105
Well, we should make a dot

00:00:58.105 --> 00:00:59.505
for each of these data points

00:00:59.505 --> 00:01:01.825
and there are one, two, three, four,

00:01:01.825 --> 00:01:03.385
five data points here.

00:01:03.385 --> 00:01:05.005
So there's five data points

00:01:05.005 --> 00:01:07.406
that I'm going to want
to put on my line plot.

00:01:07.707 --> 00:01:10.027
Then they say, "Create a line plot

00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:11.827
"that shows all of the measurements.

00:01:11.827 --> 00:01:14.027
"Click above the marking
on the number line

00:01:14.027 --> 00:01:15.267
"that matches each measurement.

00:01:15.267 --> 00:01:18.307
"Click higher to add more
dots above the same marking.

00:01:18.307 --> 00:01:19.623
"Click lower to add fewer dots."

00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:23.010
So they say that the
distance from the school

00:01:23.010 --> 00:01:25.308
to Tessa's house is 3 1/2 kilometers

00:01:25.308 --> 00:01:29.208
so we would want to put a dot at 3 1/2

00:01:29.208 --> 00:01:30.968
and I do that just by clicking,

00:01:30.968 --> 00:01:33.528
clicking right over there, 3 1/2.

00:01:33.535 --> 00:01:35.900
So that's one data point at 3 1/2.

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.631
Half way between three and four.

00:01:38.261 --> 00:01:39.704
Let's do it for the next ones.

00:01:40.155 --> 00:01:41.496
5 1/2, that's the distance

00:01:41.496 --> 00:01:43.132
from the library to her house.

00:01:43.963 --> 00:01:48.317
5 1/2, then we have two kilometers.

00:01:49.256 --> 00:01:51.656
Two kilometers, distance from ...

00:01:52.335 --> 00:01:53.677
Two kilometers was the distance

00:01:53.677 --> 00:01:54.944
from the park to her house.

00:01:55.275 --> 00:01:57.455
Then the movie theater if four kilometers.

00:01:57.877 --> 00:01:59.597
I wish you could see it all in one screen.

00:02:00.295 --> 00:02:01.133
Four kilometers.

00:02:01.755 --> 00:02:05.776
And then the post office
is also 5 1/2 kilometers.

00:02:05.776 --> 00:02:07.356
So you actually have two data points

00:02:07.356 --> 00:02:09.456
at 5 1/2 kilometers.

00:02:09.636 --> 00:02:11.526
So right here I've just
constructed a line plot.

00:02:11.526 --> 00:02:13.326
At different points on the number line

00:02:13.326 --> 00:02:15.386
I'm showing how many data points we have.

00:02:15.386 --> 00:02:17.806
So we have one data
point at two kilometers,

00:02:17.806 --> 00:02:20.873
one at 3 1/2 kilometers,
one at four kilometers,

00:02:20.873 --> 00:02:23.373
and two at 5 1/2 kilometers.

00:02:23.647 --> 00:02:26.439
Now notice, we said we
would have five dots

00:02:26.439 --> 00:02:29.091
when we have one, two, three, four, five.

00:02:29.091 --> 00:02:30.686
One for each data point.

00:02:31.211 --> 00:02:32.471
Let's do this one more time.

00:02:32.471 --> 00:02:34.154
Let's check and make sure we got it right.

00:02:34.154 --> 00:02:35.534
Now let's do one more.

00:02:36.474 --> 00:02:38.374
All right, measure the length ...

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:41.094
Measure the length of each line

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:43.254
to the nearest quarter
inch to collect data

00:02:43.254 --> 00:02:44.794
for the line plot below.

00:02:44.794 --> 00:02:45.874
To make your measurements,

00:02:45.874 --> 00:02:48.094
drag the ruler on top of the lines.

00:02:48.094 --> 00:02:49.715
Align the left end of the ruler

00:02:49.715 --> 00:02:51.075
with the left end of the lines

00:02:51.075 --> 00:02:53.285
then read the length of each line

00:02:53.285 --> 00:02:55.322
from the right end of the line.

00:02:55.856 --> 00:02:57.743
All right, so really I
just wanna measure ...

00:02:58.208 --> 00:02:59.564
I just wanna measure, oh this is ...

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:01.554
I didn't mean to tilt it like that.

00:03:02.248 --> 00:03:04.558
I just wanna measure each of these lines.

00:03:05.142 --> 00:03:07.522
So this green line right over here

00:03:07.522 --> 00:03:11.562
looks like it is six
and this is split into

00:03:11.562 --> 00:03:12.962
one, two, three, four.

00:03:12.962 --> 00:03:15.795
It looks like it's 6 3/4ths.

00:03:16.242 --> 00:03:21.242
6 3/4ths, the green line
is 6 3/4ths inches long.

00:03:21.762 --> 00:03:24.794
So we have one data point at 6 3/4ths.

00:03:25.442 --> 00:03:27.262
So I'll put that right over there.

00:03:28.342 --> 00:03:31.242
Then we have the red line is ...

00:03:32.242 --> 00:03:36.168
Let's see, this is 7 2/4ths or 7 1/2.

00:03:36.822 --> 00:03:38.826
It's halfway between seven and eight.

00:03:39.382 --> 00:03:44.002
So 7 2/4ths or 7 1/2, so halfway between

00:03:44.002 --> 00:03:45.423
seven and eight is right over there.

00:03:46.302 --> 00:03:49.602
Then finally I have the purple line.

00:03:50.342 --> 00:03:52.194
The purple line, let's see.

00:03:53.042 --> 00:03:56.082
That is 8 3/4ths inches long.

00:03:56.102 --> 00:03:58.582
Notice I aligned it right at the beginning

00:03:58.582 --> 00:04:00.362
right over there and it goes all the way

00:04:00.362 --> 00:04:04.202
to eight and one, two,
three out of the four.

00:04:04.202 --> 00:04:09.202
8 3/4ths inches long, so let me, 8 3/4ths.

00:04:10.202 --> 00:04:11.102
So there you go.

00:04:11.102 --> 00:04:13.062
I have one line that was 6 3/4ths,

00:04:13.062 --> 00:04:16.434
one line that was 7 2/4ths or 7 1/2

00:04:16.434 --> 00:04:19.260
and then one line that's
8 3/4ths inches long.

00:04:19.768 --> 00:04:21.282
Let's check our answer.

00:04:23.412 --> 00:04:24.302
Let's do one more.

00:04:24.302 --> 00:04:25.243
This is actually a lot of fun.

00:04:25.842 --> 00:04:27.619
All right, we gotta measure things again.

00:04:27.988 --> 00:04:30.599
So let's see, the green line.

00:04:31.239 --> 00:04:34.380
Green line is exactly three inches long,

00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.376
three inches long so let's plot it

00:04:36.376 --> 00:04:37.094
right over there.

00:04:38.076 --> 00:04:41.256
Then we have the red line is exactly,

00:04:41.256 --> 00:04:43.616
let's see, 3 3/4ths inches long.

00:04:44.316 --> 00:04:47.076
3 3/4ths, let's put a
dot right over there.

00:04:47.806 --> 00:04:52.697
Then the purple line is
three inches long as well.

00:04:52.697 --> 00:04:55.377
So I have another data
point at three inches.

00:04:55.377 --> 00:04:57.717
So two of the lines were three inches

00:04:57.717 --> 00:04:59.838
and one of them is 3 3/4ths

00:04:59.838 --> 00:05:01.441
and we are ...

00:05:02.018 --> 00:05:03.428
And we're done.
