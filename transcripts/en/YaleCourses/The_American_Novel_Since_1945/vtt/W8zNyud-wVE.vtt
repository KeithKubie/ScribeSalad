00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:06.530
Let me ask you a question first about John Barth and the stories that I asked

2
00:00:06.571 --> 00:00:09.660
you to read.
Which of them was your favorite?

3
00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.500
Some cackling.
I hear none of them.

4
00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:21.790
Which of them was your favorite lacy journey?
Nitesy journey.
Why?

5
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:27.060
Um,
I thought it was the profoundest joke I've ever heard.
Hi.
Yes.

6
00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:30.510
Okay.
Very good.
Yes,
that's,
that's a very,

7
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:34.380
the profoundest joke she has ever heard.
Who else?

8
00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:38.880
Your favorite story?
Yes.
Awesome.
Okay.
Why is that?

9
00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:44.140
I really like the tricks that are played with Kathy rare.

10
00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:48.300
[inaudible].
Yes.
Okay.
What else?
Other favorites?

11
00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:51.750
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

12
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:54.240
<v 0>Did anyone have Ambrose?
His mark as a favorite?</v>

13
00:00:56.010 --> 00:00:59.760
Only one of two of you.
That's extremely surprising.

14
00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.850
Um,
why was Ambrose his mark,
not your favorite?

15
00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:08.360
What did you not like about it

16
00:01:11.460 --> 00:01:15.410
<v 1>anyway?
Yes.
I actually thought it was hard to understand.</v>

17
00:01:15.790 --> 00:01:19.940
Just like what,
what was happening.
The action,
the story

18
00:01:22.340 --> 00:01:23.630
might have been that I read it too quickly.

19
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:29.550
<v 0>Harder than mental lab to understand.
No.
No.
Oh,</v>

20
00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.370
okay.
Uh,
anyone else on Ambross?

21
00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.940
Mark Comments?

22
00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:39.700
When I asked this question typically,

23
00:01:39.701 --> 00:01:43.240
especially when I've had students read the whole thing,
Ambrose is,

24
00:01:43.241 --> 00:01:45.850
mark is almost always the favorite story.

25
00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:52.620
And the reason for that I think is that it is a technically perfect short story.

26
00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:00.610
It has wit,
it has developed characters,

27
00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:05.670
it has a coherent narrative.
Um,
even if it has some,
uh,

28
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:09.640
difficulties,
that's probably more due to things like dialect.

29
00:02:09.670 --> 00:02:14.540
There's a German immigrant dialect that some of the characters speak.
Um,

30
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:19.900
it's full of little,
um,
little tropes,

31
00:02:19.901 --> 00:02:24.030
little consistencies,
little images,
the bees,
um,

32
00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:28.780
even the word play skep and skeptical.
Uh,

33
00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.870
there are words that mirror some of the major themes of that story about naming

34
00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:41.430
Barth by offering us a perfect short story in that story is demonstrating what

35
00:02:44.620 --> 00:02:49.620
traditional structures of narrative have always offered us and the fact that

36
00:02:50.081 --> 00:02:51.920
it's not your favorite meeting.

37
00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.090
Maybe we're at a watershed moment that even traditional narrative can just,

38
00:02:57.851 --> 00:03:02.680
you guys are so well beyond that,
that seduction.

39
00:03:03.310 --> 00:03:06.100
Maybe it's Lolita that we read.
Maybe it's that you've,

40
00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.130
you got so seduced by Lolita or you were so well trained to be skeptical of

41
00:03:11.531 --> 00:03:15.460
narrative seduction that now nothing can phase.
You've,
nothing can seduce you.

42
00:03:15.461 --> 00:03:19.780
Maybe that's it.
Give yourself that credit.
Um,

43
00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:24.340
John Barth is a teacher through and through.

44
00:03:24.341 --> 00:03:26.920
He actually taught at my Alma Mater,

45
00:03:26.921 --> 00:03:30.610
Johns Hopkins for over 30 years in the writing program.

46
00:03:31.180 --> 00:03:36.180
And I once got from him I handout that he would give to his fiction classes.

47
00:03:38.410 --> 00:03:42.460
And it had on it,
oh,
the traditional,

48
00:03:43.970 --> 00:03:44.803
<v 1>uh,</v>

49
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:49.530
<v 0>tricks and structures of the short story form.
It was like three or four pages,</v>

50
00:03:49.531 --> 00:03:52.320
single space typed things like,
you know,

51
00:03:52.321 --> 00:03:55.500
if there are five pistols hanging on the wall,
by the end of the story,

52
00:03:55.501 --> 00:04:00.480
they all have to go off,
you know,
these totally structural,
uh,

53
00:04:00.481 --> 00:04:05.190
observations about how to write a piece of short fiction.
Um,

54
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.670
it's so appropriate in my various moves in my life.

55
00:04:08.671 --> 00:04:12.090
I lost this piece of paper and I can,
I have never been able to find it.

56
00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.490
And I've tried to be in touch with him about it and I,

57
00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.830
and I couldn't get it from him either.
So,
um,

58
00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:22.770
this is one of the sad things about teaching Barth for me.
He was such a teacher.

59
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:27.260
Um,
I think this story collection is very much a teaching,
uh,

60
00:04:27.261 --> 00:04:31.640
of us about narrative.
Um,
I'm sorry that I can't,
uh,

61
00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:35.250
now produce that as your teacher for you.
Um,

62
00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:39.920
I want to do something that might,

63
00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:42.510
<v 1>uh,
seem odd</v>

64
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:46.313
as I begin.

65
00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:04.560
<v 0>Does this shock anyone?
Do you like having this real sense?
Oh,
don't do that.</v>

66
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.230
If you do,
you're probably taught like me never,
never damaged your book.

67
00:05:10.260 --> 00:05:14.040
Getting in trouble in our house.
If,
if,
if you damaged a book,

68
00:05:14.041 --> 00:05:15.180
you were in big trouble.
Okay?

69
00:05:15.181 --> 00:05:19.350
So what I'm doing is I'm taking the Mobius Strip from the beginning and I am

70
00:05:19.351 --> 00:05:22.650
matching the letters here.
Capital a,

71
00:05:23.490 --> 00:05:24.570
let's see how does it go?

72
00:05:28.230 --> 00:05:32.580
Capital a overlaps with small A.

73
00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.410
Capital B overlaps with small B,
tape it together.
Okay,
here we go.

74
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:39.240
Once upon a time,

75
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.390
there was a story that began once upon a time.

76
00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.980
There was a story that began once upon a time.
Okay,
so you get the point.
Why?

77
00:05:50.070 --> 00:05:53.820
Why does Barth put this in the front of his story?

78
00:05:54.810 --> 00:05:55.111
Well,

79
00:05:55.111 --> 00:05:58.910
I think there are several reasons and I'm going to name about three of them.

80
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:05.600
One is that language is material.

81
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.470
I think we have a visceral response sometimes when you cut a book because

82
00:06:11.841 --> 00:06:16.841
somehow we don't want to be reminded that a story is in a material container,

83
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.890
but he invites us to do this to his story.

84
00:06:23.030 --> 00:06:26.420
So that's the first point,
it's material.

85
00:06:26.660 --> 00:06:31.660
The second point is that narrative has a form and that it can be constructed,

86
00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:39.980
built.
It's like a craft.
I had my little tape and my little scissors,

87
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.850
my little project,
my craft project.

88
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:47.780
So stories are a craft.

89
00:06:47.810 --> 00:06:51.320
They get built of the material of language.

90
00:06:55.440 --> 00:07:00.440
Last point form is both endless and closed.

91
00:07:03.990 --> 00:07:08.990
It is both repetitious and endlessly filled with possibility

92
00:07:12.510 --> 00:07:15.780
because when you read this in its mobius strip form,

93
00:07:15.930 --> 00:07:20.730
you repeating a beginning over and over and over again.

94
00:07:21.090 --> 00:07:23.730
It gives you that feeling of possibility,

95
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:30.270
but it's also boring.
This is not an interesting story.

96
00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:32.610
It doesn't tell us anything.

97
00:07:34.230 --> 00:07:39.120
John Barth runs a certain kinds of risk in this story collection and it's the

98
00:07:39.121 --> 00:07:42.930
risk of difficulty.
If I had had you read the whole thing,

99
00:07:42.931 --> 00:07:46.110
you would see even more the kind of risk he's running.

100
00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:51.410
Some of the stories are self consciously boringly,

101
00:07:52.260 --> 00:07:53.280
Mehta,
fictional.

102
00:07:54.450 --> 00:07:59.450
They sound like all those stories we have about somebody writing a story about

103
00:08:01.351 --> 00:08:05.100
themselves,
about themselves writing a story,

104
00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:10.020
who is also writing a story about themselves writing a story.
It's very boring.

105
00:08:10.230 --> 00:08:12.300
There's no kind of life in it.

106
00:08:12.690 --> 00:08:15.300
It's all about that endless regress.

107
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:22.070
So Barth is taking a risk that this little craft project emphasizes and that the

108
00:08:24.721 --> 00:08:26.490
stories in the book act out.

109
00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.043
<v 1>Hmm.</v>

110
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.050
<v 0>Why is it worth it to him to take that risk?</v>

111
00:08:32.051 --> 00:08:36.940
What's he trying to teach us about narrative and about language that makes it

112
00:08:36.941 --> 00:08:39.670
worth this risk?
Now,

113
00:08:39.671 --> 00:08:43.960
let me just make the last point I want to make about this and that's that.

114
00:08:43.961 --> 00:08:47.440
Because language is material,
it has form,

115
00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:50.110
it has both closeness and possibility.

116
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:53.440
It's susceptible to the workings of craft.

117
00:08:54.070 --> 00:08:55.980
It's also unpredictable.

118
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.590
What's going to happen to that now?
Who's going to find it?

119
00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.470
It's going to sit there,
it's going to blow from place to place.
Again,

120
00:09:06.471 --> 00:09:10.670
in other stories that I didn't have you read the theme of the message in the

121
00:09:10.671 --> 00:09:13.730
bottle returns over and over again.

122
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:19.780
The sense that language is material means that it can be separate from people

123
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:26.060
and have a kind of life of its own.
Now one question for us is,

124
00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:30.980
is the life of its own that Barth dreams of for language similar to that life of

125
00:09:30.981 --> 00:09:35.981
its own that novakof dreamed of for his language?

126
00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:39.980
So that's a question I want you to keep in your mind.

127
00:09:40.670 --> 00:09:43.370
Is this the same dream or is it somehow different?

128
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.420
So I'm going to leave that there and maybe some,
I don't know,

129
00:09:47.421 --> 00:09:51.710
some chemistry class will show up in here and,
and someone will wonder what that,

130
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:56.450
what that is and Barth we'll have done his work or we will have done,
uh,

131
00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:57.650
Barthes work for him.

132
00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:00.513
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

133
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:05.630
<v 0>no.
Let me ask you another question.
Who is the narrator of nitesy journey?</v>

134
00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.263
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

135
00:10:11.230 --> 00:10:15.710
<v 0>Yes.
A sperm.
Did everyone get that?
No.</v>

136
00:10:16.090 --> 00:10:19.030
Okay.
The narrator of nitesy journey is a sperm.

137
00:10:19.060 --> 00:10:23.200
Now we have a story with a sperm as a narrator.

138
00:10:24.250 --> 00:10:25.960
Well I think there are a couple of points,

139
00:10:25.961 --> 00:10:29.050
a couple of reasons why Barth wants to do that.

140
00:10:29.051 --> 00:10:31.360
And actually related to this initial,

141
00:10:31.361 --> 00:10:34.120
your initial point about why you liked this,
that it was,

142
00:10:34.121 --> 00:10:38.200
how did you say that it was the most profound joke?

143
00:10:38.440 --> 00:10:42.070
It is a parody of all the meanings of life.

144
00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:46.090
That philosophy has offered up to us over the ages.

145
00:10:46.810 --> 00:10:51.810
So it kind of runs through them in the voice of our narrator sperms Powell,

146
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:56.950
who is now gone and dead before him.

147
00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:03.340
So we get a kind of wisdom in a parotic form.
There are other points,

148
00:11:03.341 --> 00:11:05.980
however,
and if you look on page four,

149
00:11:06.790 --> 00:11:09.490
we can see just a little example of one of them.

150
00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:17.040
This sperm has gained quite a vocabulary and it includes,

151
00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:18.940
uh,
this line.

152
00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:24.040
I have seen the best swimmers of my generation go under now.

153
00:11:24.041 --> 00:11:25.510
Where's that from?
Of course,

154
00:11:25.511 --> 00:11:30.511
it's from how I've seen the best minds of my generation love,

155
00:11:30.601 --> 00:11:31.434
blah,
blah,
blah,
blah.

156
00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:38.340
The point of making a sperm who quotes not only Allen Ginsburg but also hosts of

157
00:11:40.001 --> 00:11:45.001
other prior literary texts is the point that the tradition precedes the

158
00:11:46.301 --> 00:11:47.350
individual speaker.

159
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:52.710
The individual speaker believes that he has an original voice.

160
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.600
He believes he's speaking in his own voice,

161
00:11:56.320 --> 00:11:59.860
but lo and behold,
his words are not his own.

162
00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:01.670
<v 1>Okay,</v>

163
00:12:01.670 --> 00:12:06.670
<v 0>so just as this is a redaction and a compression of all the various meanings of</v>

164
00:12:07.611 --> 00:12:10.550
life that philosophy western philosophy has offered up,

165
00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:16.150
it is also a demonstration of how literary tropes,

166
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:21.680
literary language,
little packaged bits of literature,

167
00:12:21.681 --> 00:12:24.770
quotations,
illusions,
Lard,

168
00:12:24.771 --> 00:12:28.100
the language that is available to this creature.

169
00:12:32.170 --> 00:12:34.600
His final reflections

170
00:12:37.060 --> 00:12:38.440
on page 12

171
00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.040
<v 1>suggest</v>

172
00:12:43.260 --> 00:12:48.260
<v 0>his ambition as a speaker and it looks a lot like a modernist ambition.</v>

173
00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:56.000
The bottom of page 12 what has fetched me across this dreadful C is a single

174
00:12:56.131 --> 00:13:01.131
hope gift of my poor dead comrade that you may be stronger willed than I,

175
00:13:02.360 --> 00:13:07.200
and that by sheer force of concentration I may transmit to you along with your

176
00:13:07.201 --> 00:13:08.460
official heritage,

177
00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.640
a private legacy of awful reveleigh recollection and negative resolve.

178
00:13:16.470 --> 00:13:17.520
Mad Is,
it may be.

179
00:13:17.521 --> 00:13:22.521
My dream is that some unimaginable in Ma embodiment of myself or myself plus her

180
00:13:23.430 --> 00:13:24.660
if that's how it must be,

181
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:29.730
we'll come to find itself expressing in however garbled or radical a

182
00:13:29.731 --> 00:13:34.290
translation,
some reflection of these reflections.

183
00:13:36.840 --> 00:13:37.130
<v 1>Okay.</v>

184
00:13:37.130 --> 00:13:42.130
<v 0>It's a dream of changing the tradition of having that individual voice added to</v>

185
00:13:42.411 --> 00:13:47.411
the tradition to have it become part of the official heritage and yet at odds

186
00:13:48.411 --> 00:13:50.450
with it casting a different light back.

187
00:13:50.480 --> 00:13:54.980
This is precisely that modernist dream,

188
00:13:55.820 --> 00:14:00.470
specifically articulated by Tsa Elliot and tradition in the individual talent

189
00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:05.680
that the contribution of the individual ads too and changes the tradition in one

190
00:14:07.970 --> 00:14:08.900
swoop.

191
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:15.970
Is this going to be Barthes ambition too?

192
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.950
This is a question for us again that I want to kind of keep up on the shelf in

193
00:14:20.951 --> 00:14:21.784
your mind.

194
00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:23.920
<v 1>Okay.</v>

195
00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:28.760
<v 0>In some way it's a parody of that modernist effort when it comes in the voice of</v>

196
00:14:28.761 --> 00:14:32.200
the sperm because this whole story is a parody,

197
00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:37.860
so you have to ask that question and be somewhat skeptical for all that Barth

198
00:14:38.231 --> 00:14:39.310
looks like.

199
00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:44.520
He embodies that traditional modernist ambition of difficulty of working with

200
00:14:45.311 --> 00:14:49.360
tradition and so on.
He looks like a classic,

201
00:14:49.510 --> 00:14:52.940
late modernist,
but is he really,
this is a question.

202
00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.013
<v 1>Okay.</v>

203
00:14:56.210 --> 00:14:56.810
<v 0>Ambrose.</v>

204
00:14:56.810 --> 00:15:01.810
His mark purports to be the story of the birth of that being when the sperm from

205
00:15:06.201 --> 00:15:09.410
nitesy journey is United with the egg.

206
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:14.440
So this is Ambrose's conception that we see the preamble to and in Ambrose,

207
00:15:17.271 --> 00:15:19.760
his mark,
if you look on

208
00:15:22.070 --> 00:15:25.040
page 19,

209
00:15:25.890 --> 00:15:26.723
<v 1>okay,</v>

210
00:15:27.560 --> 00:15:31.430
<v 0>you will see that Ambrose has in some sense inherited</v>

211
00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:37.930
some aspect of that sperms remarkable linguistic facility.

212
00:15:39.890 --> 00:15:42.950
He says all that winter,
this was in the middle of the page,

213
00:15:42.980 --> 00:15:45.530
all that winter as I grew in mother's womb,

214
00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:49.790
grandfather fretted with his scheme to get,
uh,

215
00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:51.200
Willie Erdmann is bs.

216
00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:56.500
When the springs first bees appeared on are pussy willows in our older cat cans,

217
00:15:56.690 --> 00:16:00.480
he was off with Hector and Conrad Sauce,
Pan and cheese cloth.

218
00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:03.770
They're researchers led them through fresh marsh,
through pine woods,

219
00:16:03.771 --> 00:16:07.040
over style and under Trussell,
but never a bee tree.

220
00:16:07.041 --> 00:16:11.600
They discovered only swampy impasses or the hives have some part time.

221
00:16:11.601 --> 00:16:12.440
A purist.

222
00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:17.720
He's narrating in great detail what happened while he was in the womb.

223
00:16:18.590 --> 00:16:20.750
Where does this knowledge come from?

224
00:16:21.290 --> 00:16:26.290
It says if his knowledge of his own conception,

225
00:16:27.021 --> 00:16:28.280
his own birth,

226
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.170
his own baby hood is a natural knowledge,

227
00:16:33.530 --> 00:16:38.530
but we must know that it had to come from someone from someone telling stories.

228
00:16:41.390 --> 00:16:42.223
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

229
00:16:42.470 --> 00:16:47.470
<v 0>The stories then become part of Ambrose's own account of his own naming and</v>

230
00:16:50.361 --> 00:16:53.450
account of the origin of his identity.

231
00:16:55.490 --> 00:16:57.500
That name Ambrose,

232
00:16:57.501 --> 00:17:02.501
his mark is a reference to Moby Dick in Moby Dick.

233
00:17:03.170 --> 00:17:07.190
When Queequeg signs on to the p Quad,

234
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:13.120
he makes a mark because he's illiterate in place of writing his name,

235
00:17:14.030 --> 00:17:15.170
signing his name,

236
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:19.610
and in the novel it says Queequeg his mark.

237
00:17:20.030 --> 00:17:23.510
That's what's written underneath it on the contract.

238
00:17:25.550 --> 00:17:30.550
With that mark quick [inaudible] signs on to the whole trajectory of a Habs mad

239
00:17:34.731 --> 00:17:35.810
pursuit of the whale.

240
00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:41.260
We can think of that in another way as well though with that mark quick,

241
00:17:41.261 --> 00:17:45.440
Craig signs on to the whole trajectory of the 19th century novel,

242
00:17:45.560 --> 00:17:50.560
that whole narrative excess that Melville offers and that whole sense of destiny

243
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:56.340
that is bound up with a hab story.

244
00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:04.020
What does Ambrose sign up for with his mark?

245
00:18:04.750 --> 00:18:07.840
Well,
the first thing to notice is that unlike Queequeg,

246
00:18:07.960 --> 00:18:12.960
he does not sign that mark the mark here is what he's marked by,

247
00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.160
not what he marks with.

248
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:21.950
And so it's as if the whole tradition comes out and grabs him

249
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:25.890
and names him.

250
00:18:27.270 --> 00:18:32.270
And so uncle Carl's efforts to interpret the incident of the B

251
00:18:34.930 --> 00:18:39.930
and its relation to the mark on his face suggest the way that certain kinds of

252
00:18:42.371 --> 00:18:47.230
tradition that uncle Carl has been reading probably in the book of Knowledge

253
00:18:47.230 --> 00:18:52.000
Encyclopedia that he sells door to door.
He's a sort of scholarly guy,
um,

254
00:18:52.870 --> 00:18:57.670
that that tradition has named him.
He has no agency

255
00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.370
in this,
in this trajectory.
He's entering upon

256
00:19:04.990 --> 00:19:09.990
the effort to take the story of his birth and tell it as if it were natural

257
00:19:11.351 --> 00:19:15.580
knowledge,
is the effort to fight against that lack of agency.

258
00:19:16.120 --> 00:19:18.910
He takes those stories and he makes them his own.

259
00:19:19.930 --> 00:19:24.930
That's an effort at gaining control over what he cannot know about his own

260
00:19:26.171 --> 00:19:30.130
origin and what he cannot choose in his own origin.

261
00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:38.900
I think that's also why Barth chose to write this story in the perfect short

262
00:19:40.411 --> 00:19:45.411
story form and that form is also given to us in lost in the fun house on page 95

263
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:49.920
when we get the diagram of fry tags triangle.

264
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.180
So if you look at it here on 95 we're told in the course of the story about

265
00:19:57.090 --> 00:19:59.850
Ambrose and Magda and the family,

266
00:20:01.590 --> 00:20:06.060
the action of conventional dramatic narrative may be represented by a diagram

267
00:20:06.061 --> 00:20:08.400
called fry tags,
triangle ABC,

268
00:20:08.430 --> 00:20:12.150
and remember those are the letters from the mobius strip as well or more

269
00:20:12.151 --> 00:20:14.970
accurately by variant of that diagram,
a,
B,
c,

270
00:20:14.971 --> 00:20:18.600
d with Ab representing the exposition and so on and so forth.

271
00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.530
If you read on down in that paragraph,

272
00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.970
you will see that Ambrose in his frustration,

273
00:20:26.971 --> 00:20:31.971
in his effort to control the story that is always in this story spinning out of

274
00:20:33.331 --> 00:20:34.164
control.

275
00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:39.800
He wants to be able to use for I tags triangle to prop up what has become an

276
00:20:40.861 --> 00:20:43.890
uncontrollable narrative and give it a shape.

277
00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:50.200
He retells even from sentence to the next,
he changes his mind.

278
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:54.250
He says,
this can't go on much longer.
It can go on forever.

279
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:56.980
He died telling stories to himself in the dark.

280
00:20:56.981 --> 00:20:59.320
He's dreaming about what will happen to him in the fun house.

281
00:20:59.590 --> 00:21:03.460
Years later when that vast unsuspected area of the funhouse came to light,

282
00:21:03.580 --> 00:21:07.490
the first expedition found his skeleton in one of its labyrinthine Carter

283
00:21:07.520 --> 00:21:10.240
corridors and mistook it for a part of the entertainment.

284
00:21:10.360 --> 00:21:14.380
He died of starvation telling himself stories in the dark,
but unbeknownst,

285
00:21:14.381 --> 00:21:15.610
unbeknownst to him,

286
00:21:15.730 --> 00:21:20.320
an assistant or operator of the fun house happening to overhear him crouch just

287
00:21:20.321 --> 00:21:24.070
behind the ply board partition and wrote down every word,

288
00:21:24.310 --> 00:21:25.630
the operators daughter,

289
00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:29.710
an exquisite young woman with a figure unusually well developed for her age,

290
00:21:29.830 --> 00:21:33.880
Crouch,
judge just behind the partition and transcribed his every word.

291
00:21:33.970 --> 00:21:37.360
He changes the story from one sentence to the next.

292
00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.020
Fry Tags Triangle won't help him at all.

293
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:42.740
<v 1>Yeah,</v>

294
00:21:42.740 --> 00:21:47.740
<v 0>so just knowing the form that the story's supposed to take and then knowing that</v>

295
00:21:48.351 --> 00:21:53.000
language has grabbed you.
All these formulaic little phrases,

296
00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.420
a figure unusually well developed for her age.

297
00:21:56.421 --> 00:21:58.790
These little stock freezes

298
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:01.770
there.

299
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:06.770
What he has to work with even though they are what defeat him in his effort to

300
00:22:08.551 --> 00:22:11.910
make sense of this experience with Magda.

301
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:17.300
And it is the experience of Magda that produces the problem in the first place.

302
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.490
And so if we look at page 84

303
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:31.313
<v 1>oops,</v>

304
00:22:34.580 --> 00:22:39.410
<v 0>you can see the sort of primal scene of this problem.</v>

305
00:22:40.010 --> 00:22:45.010
This is when he and Magda were having a sort of erotic game.

306
00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:46.510
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

307
00:22:46.510 --> 00:22:51.510
<v 0>One summer in the shed they were playing slaves and masters and he was the</v>

308
00:22:52.031 --> 00:22:54.550
master and she was the slave.

309
00:22:56.460 --> 00:22:56.630
<v 1>Okay.</v>

310
00:22:56.630 --> 00:23:01.630
<v 0>So he's imagining their future and talking about it with Magda when they're</v>

311
00:23:05.691 --> 00:23:06.524
older.

312
00:23:07.250 --> 00:23:08.083
<v 1>Okay.</v>

313
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:13.110
<v 0>I'm going to start sort of in the middle of the page.
He would be famous,</v>

314
00:23:13.111 --> 00:23:17.160
quite famous in his line of work,
whether Magda was his wife or not.

315
00:23:17.161 --> 00:23:20.730
One evening he was why when he was wise lined and gray at the temples,

316
00:23:20.731 --> 00:23:24.930
he'd smile gravely at a fashionable dinner party and remind her of his youthful

317
00:23:24.931 --> 00:23:28.290
passion.
The time they went with his family to ocean city,

318
00:23:28.470 --> 00:23:30.840
the erotic fantasies he used to have about her.

319
00:23:31.470 --> 00:23:36.280
How long ago it seemed and childish.
Childish yet tender to Nest Po.

320
00:23:36.330 --> 00:23:38.040
That's a Humbert moment.
That's Humbert.

321
00:23:39.180 --> 00:23:41.190
Would you have imagined that the world famous,

322
00:23:41.191 --> 00:23:45.770
whatever remembered how many strings are on the liar on the bench beside girl on

323
00:23:45.771 --> 00:23:47.150
the label of the cigar box,

324
00:23:47.151 --> 00:23:52.151
he'd stared at in the tool shed at age 10 while she age 11 even then he had felt

325
00:23:54.471 --> 00:23:57.110
wise beyond his years.
Another stock phrase,

326
00:23:57.260 --> 00:24:02.060
he'd stroked her hair and said in his deepest voice and correct just English as

327
00:24:02.061 --> 00:24:05.360
to a dear child.
I shall never forget this moment,

328
00:24:06.590 --> 00:24:10.400
but though he had breathed,
heavily groaned as if ecstatic.

329
00:24:10.730 --> 00:24:15.730
What he'd really felt throughout was an odd detachment as though somewhere

330
00:24:16.250 --> 00:24:20.510
someone else we're master strive as he might to be transported.

331
00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:23.990
He had heard his mind take notes upon the scene.

332
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.420
This is what they call passion.
I am experiencing it.

333
00:24:30.470 --> 00:24:32.000
Many of the danger machines,

334
00:24:32.001 --> 00:24:35.660
a digger machines were out of order in the penny arcade's and could not be

335
00:24:35.661 --> 00:24:40.070
repaired or replaced for the duration.
Moreover,
the prizes made.
Now in USA,

336
00:24:40.730 --> 00:24:42.890
it goes off in this strange digression,

337
00:24:42.891 --> 00:24:46.640
it seems like his mind has simply wandered as it does from one version of the

338
00:24:46.641 --> 00:24:47.810
story to another.

339
00:24:48.950 --> 00:24:53.950
But the mention of the machines is not incidental narrative becomes a kind of

340
00:24:55.971 --> 00:24:56.481
machine.

341
00:24:56.481 --> 00:25:01.370
You put your penny in the slot and it works to produce the narrative.

342
00:25:01.550 --> 00:25:06.550
And that's that first part that I read where he's looking back fondly with Magda

343
00:25:06.830 --> 00:25:11.830
from His Eminence later in life and it seems safely past and something that can

344
00:25:13.701 --> 00:25:14.570
be talked about.

345
00:25:15.110 --> 00:25:20.110
But the problem is that even if he could produce that kind of comforting

346
00:25:20.361 --> 00:25:21.200
narrative,

347
00:25:21.440 --> 00:25:26.000
the problem it produced at the level of identity will never be repaired.

348
00:25:27.230 --> 00:25:32.230
Self alienation in Barthes work is the product of desire,

349
00:25:33.350 --> 00:25:35.060
desire,
love.

350
00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:38.360
That's the moment when you're supposed to be perfectly present.

351
00:25:39.290 --> 00:25:41.690
And what happens to Andrew and Ambrose.

352
00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:46.780
That's the moment when he is perfectly a distressingly alienated from himself

353
00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:54.520
and it's the moment when language comes in and is the product of that alienation

354
00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.780
or perhaps when language comes in and causes that alienation so he can't

355
00:26:03.171 --> 00:26:08.171
experience an erotic moment without also experiencing it through the screen of

356
00:26:11.121 --> 00:26:11.954
language.

357
00:26:12.650 --> 00:26:17.650
And what he ends up doing is experiencing language instead of sex.

358
00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:25.240
So this is the problem that's never solved in lost in the fun house and it has

359
00:26:27.801 --> 00:26:32.000
all kinds of
ramifications.

360
00:26:32.150 --> 00:26:34.640
This is on 83 just the page before.

361
00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:40.340
Remember this whole story takes place under the aegis of his alienation from

362
00:26:40.341 --> 00:26:41.174
himself.

363
00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.460
He's thinking about what he'd like to do in the fun house.

364
00:26:50.090 --> 00:26:53.210
If you knew your way around in the fun house,
like your own bedroom,

365
00:26:53.211 --> 00:26:57.380
you could wait until girl came along and then slip away without ever getting

366
00:26:57.381 --> 00:27:01.190
caught.
Even if her boyfriend was right with her,
she'd think he did it.

367
00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.900
It would be better to be the boyfriend and act outraged and tear the funhouse

368
00:27:07.010 --> 00:27:11.870
apart,
not act B.

369
00:27:11.870 --> 00:27:15.920
He's a master diver.
Ambrose said in feigned admiration.

370
00:27:16.490 --> 00:27:19.490
You really have to slave away at it to get that good.

371
00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:22.100
He's playing with Freudian slips,
of course.

372
00:27:22.101 --> 00:27:25.580
What he's thinking about all the times,
the master slave game.

373
00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:29.840
And so here it comes out when he's talking about his brother's diving,

374
00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:33.770
he's a master diver.
You really have to slave away at it.

375
00:27:34.070 --> 00:27:38.150
He can't control the emergence of his desire,

376
00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:41.990
his memory of the desire back into his daily speech.

377
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.620
So he can't control that Freudian slip.

378
00:27:46.940 --> 00:27:49.880
And he also has to correct himself,

379
00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.780
remind himself that he wants,

380
00:27:53.781 --> 00:27:58.610
what he wants to do in the fun house is actually not act like the outrage

381
00:27:58.611 --> 00:28:02.300
boyfriend,
but B,
the outrage boyfriend,

382
00:28:02.330 --> 00:28:04.580
this is always the problem for him,
Bros.

383
00:28:04.730 --> 00:28:07.400
He can't just be something.

384
00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.760
He is always conscious of inhabiting a performance and it's usually a verbal

385
00:28:13.641 --> 00:28:14.480
performance.

386
00:28:16.130 --> 00:28:21.130
These are the problems that plague mental AEUs so terribly in that final story

387
00:28:25.881 --> 00:28:28.280
that I asked you to read.

388
00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:34.870
So one of the problems with narrative I said earlier when we talked about the

389
00:28:34.871 --> 00:28:37.060
Mobius strip is that it's repetition.

390
00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:42.280
This suggests a kind of exhaustion of language and Ambross is use of these

391
00:28:42.281 --> 00:28:47.281
packaged phrases in lost in the fun house suggest the impossibility of using all

392
00:28:48.710 --> 00:28:50.050
that tradition,

393
00:28:50.051 --> 00:28:55.051
all that stock of language to adequately encounter what daily life will bring

394
00:28:57.191 --> 00:28:58.024
you.

395
00:28:58.300 --> 00:29:03.190
And especially to adequately in habit something like desire.

396
00:29:04.420 --> 00:29:09.280
Barth wrote a famous essay just the year before these stories came out all in

397
00:29:09.281 --> 00:29:12.280
one volume.
They had been written over a series of years,

398
00:29:12.281 --> 00:29:15.880
about five years in the 60s,
and he wrote a very famous essay,

399
00:29:15.881 --> 00:29:18.550
got a lot of exposure,
called the literature of exhaustion.

400
00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:24.190
And there he criticized a lot of the work that was being done and these are the

401
00:29:24.191 --> 00:29:25.450
terms he uses.

402
00:29:27.340 --> 00:29:27.600
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

403
00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:30.090
<v 0>Uh,
he said there were two kinds of artists,</v>

404
00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:34.650
ones who are technically up to date and ones that are not,

405
00:29:35.700 --> 00:29:37.770
those who are not right,

406
00:29:37.830 --> 00:29:42.830
a quote turn of the century type novels only in more or less mid 20th century

407
00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:47.050
language and about contemporary people and topics.

408
00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:51.730
This makes them less interesting to me than excellent writers who are also

409
00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.270
technically contemporary.
Joyce in Kafka,
for instance,

410
00:29:55.271 --> 00:29:59.350
in their time and in our Samuel Beckett and Jorge Luis Borges.

411
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:01.303
<v 1>Okay.</v>

412
00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:06.740
<v 0>What exhausts language is the failure to keep technically up to date.</v>

413
00:30:08.130 --> 00:30:13.130
And that means in innovation in form Meghalaya ad is where Barth really staked

414
00:30:16.151 --> 00:30:18.390
his claim for innovation.

415
00:30:20.230 --> 00:30:20.460
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

416
00:30:20.460 --> 00:30:25.460
<v 0>Those nested layers of narrative that are so off putting on the page that I have</v>

417
00:30:25.771 --> 00:30:29.070
to send you a handout to help you over the weekend.

418
00:30:29.250 --> 00:30:31.890
Otherwise I worry that people will be really lost.

419
00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.980
It's very off putting,

420
00:30:35.790 --> 00:30:40.470
but it's precisely those nested stories that allow him to do some of the really

421
00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.430
pleasurable things that he can do in that story.

422
00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:50.420
And I would say get at some of the very deep questions raised by the earlier

423
00:30:51.661 --> 00:30:56.400
stories,
uh,
that he finally kind of gets hold of,
uh,

424
00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.450
to use his own words in,
in this last story.

425
00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:06.060
So I want to begin by thinking about mental laces.

426
00:31:06.660 --> 00:31:09.480
Predicament with Helen,
and this is on one 46.

427
00:31:11.350 --> 00:31:11.900
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

428
00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:16.790
<v 0>So he spares Helen's life in Troy and brings her home.</v>

429
00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:23.140
And this is the story that he has been telling.

430
00:31:27.090 --> 00:31:27.923
<v 1>Okay.</v>

431
00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:32.310
<v 0>So he says,
I'm gonna.
I decided that I would,
uh,</v>

432
00:31:32.370 --> 00:31:33.570
that I would spare her life,

433
00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:37.410
but and except her groveling for forgiveness instead.

434
00:31:38.250 --> 00:31:40.650
Uh,
so this is the story he's telling himself.

435
00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:43.470
I four bore resolve to accept in lieu of her death,

436
00:31:43.471 --> 00:31:46.440
a modest portion of heartfelt grovel.
Further,

437
00:31:46.441 --> 00:31:49.550
once she'd flung herself at my knees and kissed my him,

438
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:54.690
I would order her supine and mount more as one who loves than one who conquers,

439
00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:59.040
not impossibly.
She would've quit herself if should she acquit herself.
Well,

440
00:31:59.041 --> 00:32:03.240
and often I would even entertain a plea for her eventual forgiveness and

441
00:32:03.241 --> 00:32:06.090
restoration to the Atria in house.
Accordingly,

442
00:32:06.091 --> 00:32:09.210
I drew myself up to just charge your objection,

443
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:14.070
whereupon she gave over cleaning her nails and set to drumming them on one knee.

444
00:32:14.760 --> 00:32:17.370
Let your repentance salt my shoe leather.

445
00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:22.320
I said presently and then as I lately she did my blade of anger,

446
00:32:22.321 --> 00:32:26.850
so she view my blade of love.
I only just came aboard.

447
00:32:26.851 --> 00:32:31.080
She replied,
I haven't unpacked yet with our roar.

448
00:32:31.081 --> 00:32:35.970
I went up to Campion way,
a companion way dashed,
stern to stem,

449
00:32:35.971 --> 00:32:40.070
close hold the main flog the smile from my navigator and clove us through the

450
00:32:40.071 --> 00:32:44.120
pastors of the squid leagues.
Thereafter,
when the moon changed phase,

451
00:32:44.240 --> 00:32:45.330
I overtook myself,

452
00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:49.970
determined shrewdly that her Troy chests were secured and vowing this time to

453
00:32:49.971 --> 00:32:50.810
grant the troll.

454
00:32:50.811 --> 00:32:54.980
No quarter at the second watch of night burst into her cubby and four gave her

455
00:32:54.981 --> 00:32:59.390
straight out of the unspeakable.
We'll speak no further.
I declared,

456
00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.280
I hear extend to you what?

457
00:33:01.281 --> 00:33:06.281
No other in my position would my outright pardon to which some moments after I

458
00:33:06.471 --> 00:33:10.250
briskly upended disrobe and receive it for the sake of pity.

459
00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:14.000
This offer won't stand forever and of course there are lots of phallic jokes

460
00:33:14.001 --> 00:33:18.890
here.
So,
uh,
I hope you're getting those there.
I had her,

461
00:33:18.891 --> 00:33:21.770
she yawned and responded.
It's late.

462
00:33:21.830 --> 00:33:26.830
I'm tired up the mast half a dozen times I stormed and Sinead took or to my

463
00:33:27.801 --> 00:33:28.310
navigator,

464
00:33:28.310 --> 00:33:32.780
lost sight of Nestor thundered and lightening through Poseidon's Finny feet.
Fif.

465
00:33:33.020 --> 00:33:34.670
When next I came to season,

466
00:33:34.910 --> 00:33:39.470
I stood a night slightly by while she dusk to dawn and it then solution with

467
00:33:39.471 --> 00:33:43.700
this challenge.
Her opening eyes,
man.
Born of woman is imperfect.

468
00:33:44.120 --> 00:33:48.050
On the 3287th night of your Parisian affair,

469
00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.400
I lay in some,
some,
uh,
some noises,

470
00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:57.700
some ways med picking vermin off the wound I got that day from a cunning

471
00:33:58.161 --> 00:34:01.100
Pandora's exhaustion,
closed my eyes.

472
00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:05.840
I dreamed myself was pretty Paris plucked by Aphrodite from the field and

473
00:34:05.841 --> 00:34:09.950
dropped into Helen's naked lap there we committed sweet adultery.

474
00:34:10.010 --> 00:34:12.800
I woke wet,
wet,
wept here.

475
00:34:12.801 --> 00:34:17.090
I paused in my fiction to shield my eyes and stanch the Arrow straight tracks.

476
00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.530
Claude down my cheek.

477
00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:22.910
Then is one who'd weighted precisely for her malady voice to Horsan.

478
00:34:23.090 --> 00:34:24.890
I out shouted her in these terms,

479
00:34:25.280 --> 00:34:29.030
therefore come to bed by equal on cursing on cursed.

480
00:34:29.540 --> 00:34:33.380
The victory was mine.
I still believe,
but when I made to take trophy,

481
00:34:33.381 --> 00:34:37.970
when did Helen shook her head declaring I have the curse.
She has her period.

482
00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:43.220
My Taffrail oaths took Triton stamp ground.
I fed to the fish.

483
00:34:43.221 --> 00:34:45.920
My navigator knocked my head against the Mo Mo,

484
00:34:45.980 --> 00:34:50.510
the mass and others hollered up a Gail that blew us from laconic Maliyah to

485
00:34:50.511 --> 00:34:54.200
Egypt.
My crew grew restive when the storm was spent.

486
00:34:54.201 --> 00:34:58.230
And I had done flogging me with how Yurds I chose a moment somewhere off snake

487
00:34:58.231 --> 00:35:03.231
had Libya slipped my cloak wrapped at Helen's cabin and in measured toes tones

488
00:35:03.501 --> 00:35:07.460
declared,
forgive me,
adding firmly.
Are you there?

489
00:35:08.360 --> 00:35:10.370
He's pathetic.
He's pathetic.

490
00:35:10.490 --> 00:35:15.490
He runs through all these stories about himself and as each one fails to win him

491
00:35:17.361 --> 00:35:21.410
back into Helen's cabin,
he comes up with another one.

492
00:35:23.270 --> 00:35:26.450
This is a certain kind of exhausted narrative.

493
00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:32.500
It's the failure of any of these stock narratives to have the effect of

494
00:35:33.921 --> 00:35:38.090
restoring love and desire.
Yep.
But it's

495
00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:42.650
more than that.
It's playful.
It's funny.

496
00:35:43.670 --> 00:35:44.450
Um,

497
00:35:44.450 --> 00:35:49.450
Barthes effort at showing us the exhaustion of narrative produces a kind of new

498
00:35:50.961 --> 00:35:52.400
pleasure in narrative.

499
00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:58.240
So it's by pointing it out and then parodying it that he begins to renew the

500
00:36:00.830 --> 00:36:02.870
resources of fiction.

501
00:36:05.630 --> 00:36:06.463
<v 1>There are</v>

502
00:36:06.830 --> 00:36:10.040
<v 0>deeper and more difficult issues at stake though.</v>

503
00:36:10.041 --> 00:36:13.670
And this is in one 55,
we get,
uh,
uh,

504
00:36:13.671 --> 00:36:18.671
more serious version of the scene with Magda and the problem of self alienation.

505
00:36:20.390 --> 00:36:25.390
And this is what is really at the heart of mentally assist story.

506
00:36:27.890 --> 00:36:32.890
So remember that the story is that he is obsessed with this question of why

507
00:36:35.901 --> 00:36:38.390
Helen chose him among all her suitors.

508
00:36:38.900 --> 00:36:40.970
Why did she choose him?

509
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:44.210
And when he asks on their wedding night,

510
00:36:44.690 --> 00:36:49.690
she gives him an answer that only makes him more obsessed with the question.

511
00:36:55.520 --> 00:37:00.260
So at the top of one 55,
he's asked his question speak he commanded,

512
00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:02.750
she whispered love.

513
00:37:02.780 --> 00:37:05.660
Now the problem with that is that answer,

514
00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:11.440
it's a verb and a noun and mental as doesn't know how to take it.

515
00:37:12.770 --> 00:37:14.630
So here

516
00:37:17.720 --> 00:37:22.310
it becomes a verb.
He held her fast.
She took him willy nilly to her.

517
00:37:22.370 --> 00:37:27.370
I feel her yet one endless instant mental aas was no more,

518
00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:29.300
never has been since.

519
00:37:29.301 --> 00:37:33.980
This is like that moment of erotic play with Magda for Ambrose.

520
00:37:34.550 --> 00:37:37.700
It,
it eradicates identity,

521
00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:41.420
eradicate sense of self.
It's gone forever.

522
00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.190
And you can see the change in pronouns.
She took him willy nilly to her.

523
00:37:46.191 --> 00:37:49.610
He's telling a story about himself seemingly,

524
00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:54.620
but who's the I then that's leftover.
I feel her.

525
00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:00.100
Yet there's some residual identity leftover that can still have a sense of

526
00:38:02.931 --> 00:38:07.850
embodiment
in his red ear.
Then she whispered,

527
00:38:08.030 --> 00:38:11.150
why'd I weighed you less?
What than who,
et Cetera.

528
00:38:11.930 --> 00:38:16.880
My very question speak mentally as cried to Helen on the bridal bed.

529
00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:20.900
I reminded Helen in her Trojan Bedroom.
I confessed to Ida,
Thea on the beach.

530
00:38:20.930 --> 00:38:24.620
I declared to proteus in the cave mouth.
I vouch safe to Helen on the ship.

531
00:38:24.621 --> 00:38:28.310
I told pisses stratus,
at least,
at least in my sport and hall,

532
00:38:28.490 --> 00:38:31.790
I say to whoever and where I am,

533
00:38:31.791 --> 00:38:36.370
and Helen answered love.
He complied.

534
00:38:36.371 --> 00:38:38.110
He complied as to an order.

535
00:38:38.350 --> 00:38:43.000
She took his course once more to Elysium to fade forever.
Among the feedless.

536
00:38:43.010 --> 00:38:47.680
ASPHODEL is curious.
Fancy alone remained on laid.

537
00:38:48.100 --> 00:38:49.540
When he came to himself.

538
00:38:50.170 --> 00:38:53.680
It's still asked softly why

539
00:38:55.310 --> 00:38:59.600
and don't I cry out to me every hour since.

540
00:39:01.010 --> 00:39:06.010
So that's self alienation causes him to lose his love.

541
00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:12.820
We're told later that he stops sleeping with her because he just can't get it

542
00:39:15.591 --> 00:39:18.170
out of his mind.
He'd rather sit and wonder.

543
00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:24.460
His curious fancy is more active than his desire.

544
00:39:24.770 --> 00:39:25.760
Or you might say,

545
00:39:25.761 --> 00:39:30.230
his desire to know is more active than his desire to love,

546
00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:34.820
but there's a yet yet a complication to this problem.

547
00:39:35.030 --> 00:39:37.490
It's not just about men,
Elias,

548
00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:40.580
and what he chooses to do with his desire.

549
00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:45.760
It's also about Helen and her action and her answer on one 56

550
00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:48.900
<v 1>yeah,</v>

551
00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:49.890
<v 0>he reflects,</v>

552
00:39:52.210 --> 00:39:52.610
<v 1>yeah.</v>

553
00:39:52.610 --> 00:39:56.270
<v 0>Seven years of this,
more or less,
not much conversation,</v>

554
00:39:56.271 --> 00:39:59.270
something wrong with the marriage.
Helen,

555
00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:04.300
he could hold how hold men Elias to love is easy to be loved as if one were real

556
00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:12.950
on the order of others.
Fearsome mystery,

557
00:40:13.250 --> 00:40:16.220
unbearable responsibility to her.

558
00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:21.080
Mentalis signified something recognizable as Helen to him,

559
00:40:21.950 --> 00:40:23.000
whatever was it.

560
00:40:25.010 --> 00:40:29.870
There's that sense that the other person looking at you,

561
00:40:29.990 --> 00:40:30.980
loving you,

562
00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.590
assures you somehow of your reality that you're real,

563
00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.200
that you're not an imaginary being.

564
00:40:41.570 --> 00:40:46.570
So it's a way of reminding you that you're not really alienated.

565
00:40:48.430 --> 00:40:48.580
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

566
00:40:48.580 --> 00:40:51.970
<v 0>But this is what mentally is,
cannot get his head around.</v>

567
00:40:52.540 --> 00:40:57.540
He cannot understand that he could be loved for no reason.

568
00:40:59.320 --> 00:41:02.590
And proteus sort of gives us a,

569
00:41:03.970 --> 00:41:08.380
uh,
a sense of how we can understand this.

570
00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:13.390
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

571
00:41:13.390 --> 00:41:14.800
<v 0>This is on one 61.</v>

572
00:41:16.060 --> 00:41:21.060
Helen chose you without reason because she loves you without cause.

573
00:41:21.880 --> 00:41:26.830
Embrace her without question and watch your weather change.
Let go.

574
00:41:27.850 --> 00:41:32.530
It's a failure of faith in Aphrodite.
So too,

575
00:41:32.531 --> 00:41:37.531
except love is to accept your being and to have faith that love affirms it

576
00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:44.570
affirms that being,
remember that self admonition,

577
00:41:44.571 --> 00:41:49.350
not act like the boyfriend,
but B,
this is what men,

578
00:41:49.351 --> 00:41:52.130
Elias has to ask forgiveness for.

579
00:41:52.190 --> 00:41:57.190
He didn't have enough faith in love just to be and to accept the affirmation of

580
00:41:58.371 --> 00:41:58.700
her,

581
00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:03.700
his being that Helen's reasonableness causeless love embodies.

582
00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.600
Barth is asking a really serious question about the compatibility between life

583
00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:18.440
and voice.
Remember that in Ambrose,

584
00:42:18.441 --> 00:42:23.441
his mark Ambrose is saved from the bees lighting on his mouth because his mouth

585
00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:29.480
is on his mother's breast.

586
00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:33.260
He's asleep.
They're having nursed.

587
00:42:35.370 --> 00:42:37.320
It says if the bees,

588
00:42:37.321 --> 00:42:41.340
which signify eloquence,

589
00:42:41.550 --> 00:42:46.050
if they land on your mouth,
they land on his eyes and on his ears instead.

590
00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:51.890
He can't have both that connection with his mother and that kind of eloquence.

591
00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.110
It's one or the other.

592
00:42:55.260 --> 00:42:59.040
You can't have love and language somehow.

593
00:42:59.340 --> 00:43:02.430
And this is a very Friday and understanding of how language works.

594
00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:07.700
He tells a story about a child playing what's called the Fort Da game here.

595
00:43:08.101 --> 00:43:09.900
Away he has a little ball,

596
00:43:10.170 --> 00:43:13.440
little two or three year old kid has a ball.

597
00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:17.520
He throws it away and then retrieved that.
He throws it away and retrieves it.

598
00:43:17.521 --> 00:43:20.940
And Freud theorizes that he does that and he says,

599
00:43:20.941 --> 00:43:23.370
Fort Fort Da,

600
00:43:24.300 --> 00:43:29.300
he does that because the language is a way of controlling his mother's absence

601
00:43:30.150 --> 00:43:33.780
and the ball stands in for the mother.
It disappears and then it comes back,

602
00:43:33.781 --> 00:43:37.110
it disappears and comes back.
And at that time,
his mother,

603
00:43:37.111 --> 00:43:42.111
who was actually Freud's daughter was going out to work for the first time on

604
00:43:43.231 --> 00:43:47.790
some days,
uh,
in,
and the boy was getting used to letting her go.

605
00:43:49.260 --> 00:43:51.810
So language arises from that loss.

606
00:43:51.840 --> 00:43:55.260
And Ambrose is only named once,

607
00:43:55.261 --> 00:43:58.650
he separated from his mother and no longer nurses as a,

608
00:43:58.770 --> 00:44:00.630
as a result of the incident.

609
00:44:02.110 --> 00:44:02.730
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

610
00:44:02.730 --> 00:44:06.600
<v 0>And he also only gains a male name at that time.</v>

611
00:44:06.870 --> 00:44:11.870
And so I think it's important that the masculinity of language asserted with a

612
00:44:12.991 --> 00:44:17.991
talking sperm at the very beginning of this collection is consistent with this

613
00:44:18.421 --> 00:44:22.920
sense that you become male when you enter into language.

614
00:44:22.921 --> 00:44:26.820
Somehow when you're unnamed,
you're not part of language,

615
00:44:26.970 --> 00:44:29.910
you're still connected to the mother and he actually had a female name.

616
00:44:29.911 --> 00:44:31.890
Remember he's called Christine Awhile,

617
00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:38.180
so he becomes a boy after he separated from his mother metal aliases.

618
00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:46.280
Problem with Helen suggests that in compatibility of being connected to the

619
00:44:47.701 --> 00:44:50.700
other and here across the line of gender

620
00:44:52.410 --> 00:44:57.410
connected with the other and somehow being able to be assimilated into language

621
00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:02.190
and the silence of the Oracle on the question,

622
00:45:02.191 --> 00:45:03.690
who am I?

623
00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:09.390
This is on one 58 and you just get that blank silence and you can see it in

624
00:45:09.391 --> 00:45:11.460
closed in all those quotation marks.

625
00:45:12.090 --> 00:45:17.090
This is Barthes effort to enclose the silence into something readable to contain

626
00:45:19.741 --> 00:45:22.980
that impossibility in the structure of a story.

627
00:45:22.981 --> 00:45:25.650
So all the quotation marks suggest human voice.

628
00:45:27.030 --> 00:45:29.250
I want to suggest to you finally

629
00:45:30.900 --> 00:45:35.900
that Barth is interested in the oral tradition above all other traditions in

630
00:45:36.991 --> 00:45:37.920
this book.

631
00:45:38.730 --> 00:45:43.730
He's using Greek epic as the source of his literary Canon here and his Canon of

632
00:45:45.211 --> 00:45:50.211
stories of narratives because it's oral tradition that brings the human voice

633
00:45:52.051 --> 00:45:57.051
and the human being the fact of a person together most closely.

634
00:45:57.331 --> 00:46:02.331
That's what fascinates him about the spoken word as opposed to the word you

635
00:46:02.701 --> 00:46:07.260
read.
And in other stories in this collection,

636
00:46:07.261 --> 00:46:11.550
Barth experimented with recording them with tape.

637
00:46:11.940 --> 00:46:15.360
So these are stories,
some of them for voice and tape.

638
00:46:15.510 --> 00:46:19.530
And He'd do readings where he'd go and he'd put a tape recorder on the podium

639
00:46:19.531 --> 00:46:23.430
and he'd stand next to the tape recorder as his voice read the story from the

640
00:46:23.431 --> 00:46:24.264
tape recorder.

641
00:46:24.330 --> 00:46:29.100
And it was all to dramatize the problematic relationship between voice,

642
00:46:29.101 --> 00:46:33.750
story and person.
But I think the dream of men alas,

643
00:46:33.780 --> 00:46:38.040
is that somehow that voice can be residual,

644
00:46:38.041 --> 00:46:41.490
that somehow it can survive.
And in that sense,

645
00:46:41.491 --> 00:46:46.491
I think it has something in common with Novakovic fantasy of the living artwork.

646
00:46:49.020 --> 00:46:52.320
But unlike Nebach offs fantasy,

647
00:46:52.740 --> 00:46:57.740
it requires this concept of love because love is what makes being into

648
00:47:00.541 --> 00:47:01.374
narrative.

649
00:47:01.590 --> 00:47:06.090
It takes two and it takes desire,

650
00:47:06.180 --> 00:47:10.230
desire,
moves,
narrative.
And so at the end,

651
00:47:10.231 --> 00:47:13.890
the comic ending of men Iliad,
which,

652
00:47:13.950 --> 00:47:16.800
which echoes the comic ending of Odysseus,

653
00:47:17.700 --> 00:47:21.420
trip back home of the Odyssey.
He says,

654
00:47:23.310 --> 00:47:28.310
mental as a story itself in 10 or 10,000 years expires yet I'll survive it.

655
00:47:28.801 --> 00:47:33.670
Who's this?
I I in Proteus is terrifying.
Last disguise,

656
00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.410
beauties,
spouses,

657
00:47:35.411 --> 00:47:40.411
odd Elysium the absurd unending possibility of love.

658
00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:43.930
<v 1>Okay.</v>

659
00:47:43.930 --> 00:47:48.930
<v 0>If you think that Barth and all his heady intellectual cononical difficulty is</v>

660
00:47:53.590 --> 00:47:57.700
uninterested in the world outside of his fiction,

661
00:47:58.120 --> 00:48:02.800
I think you could argue that it's on this notion of desire,

662
00:48:04.090 --> 00:48:07.060
that he stakes his works,
connection to the world,

663
00:48:08.410 --> 00:48:12.400
and the echo of that desire is,
I would say pleasure.

664
00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:15.910
Something like in this case,
in a block offs,
aesthetic bliss.

665
00:48:16.060 --> 00:48:19.660
But here it's more funny than that.

666
00:48:20.650 --> 00:48:23.160
It's not even so much the transportation,

667
00:48:23.230 --> 00:48:27.820
the nostalgic quality of Nepal,

668
00:48:27.821 --> 00:48:28.810
coughs description.

669
00:48:28.811 --> 00:48:33.790
Sometimes it's that wit that pleasurable wit,

670
00:48:33.910 --> 00:48:35.470
the pleasure we get reading,

671
00:48:35.471 --> 00:48:40.150
being absorbed by something that we have to work hard to read and yet repays us

672
00:48:40.480 --> 00:48:42.340
with with that pleasure.

673
00:48:44.800 --> 00:48:45.120
<v 1>Mm.</v>

674
00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:50.120
<v 0>When you read crying of lot 49 I'd like you to think about what that novel</v>

675
00:48:50.881 --> 00:48:55.050
represents,
uh,
in the relation between language in the world.

676
00:48:55.260 --> 00:48:56.310
Is it similar?

677
00:48:56.340 --> 00:49:00.270
Barth and pension are often talked about as part of the same metal fictional

678
00:49:00.271 --> 00:49:03.240
movement in this couple of decades,

679
00:49:03.241 --> 00:49:07.350
60s and 70s are they assimilable to one another in these terms?

680
00:49:07.530 --> 00:49:09.090
Think about that as you read.
