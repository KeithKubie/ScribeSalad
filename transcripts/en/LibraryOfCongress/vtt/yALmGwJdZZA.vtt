00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:03.970
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:20.790
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Well, it's
a pleasure for me to be here.

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:22.090
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Thank you.

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.390
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Speaking
with you, and I look forward

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:27.340
to learning more about Kuchipudi
and about your background.

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.050
First, maybe you could
tell us a little bit

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:34.890
about this classical
dance form from India.

00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:36.190
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Sure.

00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:40.120
Kuchipudi is one of eight
classical styles of India,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.410
and it comes from a southern,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:45.740
southeastern state
called Andhra Pradesh.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:53.020
And, Kuchipudi gets its name from
a village by the name Kuchipudi

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:57.230
which is located in Andhra.

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.160
And, Kuchipudi also another
characteristic feature

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:08.580
about Kuchipudi is that it was
started by an all-male group

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:14.370
of dancers, or rather one man
by the name of Siddhendra Yogi

00:01:14.370 --> 00:01:18.770
who took a young group, a
group of young Brahman boys

00:01:18.770 --> 00:01:23.790
and started teaching them the
Kuchipudi as we know it today

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:29.050
which is, which is
about 500 years old.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:32.840
Kuchipudi otherwise can be
traced back all the way to well

00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:38.580
over 2000 years ago where,
and we can say this only

00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:45.130 position:56%
because we have evidence from temple
sculptures and also other evidence

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:49.240
of classical, thriving classical
Indian dance and music culture

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:55.700
in India from mural
paintings in caves as well as,

00:01:55.700 --> 00:01:59.620
as well as beautiful
sculptures of dancers in temples.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:00.920
So, even though we know

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:06.340
that Kuchipudi originated somewhere
before around 2000 years ago.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.890
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: That's amazing.

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:09.860
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: The
Kuchipudi that we say

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:13.410
that we practice today comes
from the village of Kuchipudi

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:21.240 position:56%
which was founded by Siddhendra Yogi
in this village called Kuchipudi.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:23.650
I can go on, but I don't.

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:25.350
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
I'm curious to know,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:29.090
you said there are eight
different classical forms.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:34.000 position:56%
What is distinctive about the
Kuchipudi as opposed to these other?

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.300
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: You know,

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.960
all eight Indian classical
dance styles are in,

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.960
draw their inspiration from the
same text called the Natya Shastra,

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:52.090
and the Natya Shastra was,
is very wide in its scope.

00:02:52.090 --> 00:02:57.260
It's, and it covers chapters,

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:00.300
there are chapters
dedicated to music and dance.

00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:06.940
It's a 36 chapter book which covers
all aspects of performance art.

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.350
And, so all eight Indian classical
styles draw their inspiration

00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:17.210
from this text, however each
of these styles developed

00:03:17.210 --> 00:03:24.730 position:56%
and interpreted dance based on their
own regional cultural influences.

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:27.760
And, just as each of
these, each of the states

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.470
in India are pretty
different culturally,

00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:38.760 position:56%
the dance forms reflect that, and so
Kuchipudi as we practice it today,

00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:44.710
as I said before, came from what
Siddhendra Yogi developed 500

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:46.010
years ago.

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:50.970
And, because it was an all-male
dance form up until 75 years ago,

00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:58.640
it tends to be a more vigorous
dance form relative to, say,

00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:02.390
Bharatanatyam, Odissi which are
its neighboring dance forms.

00:04:02.390 --> 00:04:13.580 position:56%
The other interesting characteristic
trait of Kuchipudi is that it is,

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:18.320
it's both, it's got three, I'm
getting very technical here.

00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.980
It sits between Tamil
Nadu and Odisha in India,

00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:27.400
and it's a perfect
amalgamation of those two styles.

00:04:27.400 --> 00:04:31.610
For example, Odissi is
a very fluid dance form.

00:04:31.610 --> 00:04:36.520
It's, it literally feels like it,
the dance flows from one's culture

00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:39.200
as opposed to another in movement.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.720
And, contrasting that,
Bharatanatyam which is

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.950
from Tamil Nadu is a very rigid,

00:04:47.950 --> 00:04:50.880
geometrical dance form
where there are.

00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:55.700
It's highly classical, but
they draw geometric shapes

00:04:55.700 --> 00:04:58.030
in space through dance.

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:02.960
And, Kuchipudi sits somewhere
between these two where it's fluid,

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.450
at the same time it's
quite structured as well.

00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:07.940
That's the best way
I can describe that.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:09.240
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's wonderful.

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.540
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Movement.

00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:11.840
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: [inaudible].

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:13.140
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, of course,

00:05:13.140 --> 00:05:16.300
the other characteristic feature is
a lot of the poetry and the lyrics

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.780
that we use for Kuchipudi
dance comes

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:26.400
from the poets written
in the language Telugu.

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.750
So, a lot of the dances
are choreographed

00:05:30.750 --> 00:05:33.880
to poetry written by
Telugu or Sanskrit.

00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:36.870
Whereas, the other forms
use other languages

00:05:36.870 --> 00:05:40.400
that are more common
in their regions.

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.820
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: It's also a
story telling format, in a sense.

00:05:43.820 --> 00:05:45.120
Is it?

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.420
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes.

00:05:46.420 --> 00:05:47.720
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Would you
call it a dance drama format?

00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:50.510
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, the other
characteristic for, yes, very,

00:05:50.510 --> 00:05:55.140
very important feature of Kuchipudi
is Kuchipudi's history, rather,

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.380
is that it is a dance drama form.

00:05:58.380 --> 00:06:02.760
It was a dance drama
form 500 years ago,

00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:08.820
and only in the past 70 years
or so, because of gurus.

00:06:08.820 --> 00:06:11.350
My guru, Guru Vempati
Chinna Satyam and his guru,

00:06:11.350 --> 00:06:16.630
Guru Lakshminarayana Sastry that
who moved out of the village

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:21.560
of Kuchipudi and into the larger
metropolis city of Chennai

00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:24.930
which used to be called Madras.

00:06:24.930 --> 00:06:30.010
And, they incorporated not
only women into the style,

00:06:30.010 --> 00:06:34.550
but they started developing
the solo format for Kuchipudi.

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:39.130
So, today, what we perform is
largely the solo dance form.

00:06:39.130 --> 00:06:44.010
Although, the dance drama
form is still very vibrant

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:46.180
in India as well as here.

00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:48.850
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So,
in the current expression,

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:52.320
is story telling an
important part, still?

00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:54.560
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Extremely, yes, extremely.

00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:59.930
Storytelling continues to be an
important part of Indian dance.

00:06:59.930 --> 00:07:05.220
I think dance in general is a
medium of expression, and it,

00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.750
we could tell stories or express
or communicate to our audiences

00:07:10.750 --> 00:07:19.860
through stories, but the dance
form itself as enough in it.

00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.170
There is enough depth and
complexity in the dance

00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:29.760
to communicate even secular
themes or abstract themes

00:07:29.760 --> 00:07:34.150
through the form which is, yeah.

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:35.600
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Fascinating.

00:07:35.600 --> 00:07:38.820
So, your native language
is Telugu which is.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.120
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes.

00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:41.420
It is.

00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:42.720
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: The
context in which the form.

00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.020
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, yes.

00:07:44.020 --> 00:07:49.300
Since I was born and brought up in
Hyderabad which, and I am a Telugu.

00:07:49.300 --> 00:07:54.320
So, Kuchipudi seemed to be
the most natural dance style

00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.190
for me to learn growing up.

00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:59.980
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Did you,
did you study from an early age?

00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:02.600
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, I
started early at the age of eight

00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:06.360
in Hyderabad and continued
throughout,

00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:09.880
throughout my schooling
as well as college.

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.130 position:56%
And, really never really gave it up.

00:08:14.130 --> 00:08:23.850
I never really thought I would make
dance my career, but always danced

00:08:23.850 --> 00:08:25.990
because I loved to dance.

00:08:25.990 --> 00:08:29.760
And, having moved to America
right after I got married,

00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:35.260
I was extremely skeptical about
being able to continue to dance,

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:41.480 position:56%
leave alone teach to the next
generation of dancers this art form.

00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:49.390
And, but today, 25 years later,
I'm so, so deeply happy to find

00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.830
that not only could,
not only Kuchipudi seems

00:08:53.830 --> 00:08:58.310
to be flourishing here in the
United States, but there is a sense

00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:04.750
of connectedness that the
dance students here feel

00:09:04.750 --> 00:09:10.530
to their heritage, through
their learning of this dance.

00:09:10.530 --> 00:09:17.800
And, just to briefly explain the
most recent dance that we presented

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:20.920
in celebration of our 25 years.

00:09:20.920 --> 00:09:26.910
We did a new work called "Why We
Dance", and the new work revolved

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:32.350
around the feelings and the
thoughts of the Kalanidhi dancers.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:37.350
And, four basic themes emerged
when I asked them the questions

00:09:37.350 --> 00:09:39.230
to why they dance, and one

00:09:39.230 --> 00:09:42.540
of them was their connection
to their heritage.

00:09:42.540 --> 00:09:45.920
And, the second was the sense
of freedom and liberation

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.260
from their mundane, routine lives.

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:53.140
The third was storytelling which
they felt, for that period of time,

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.220
for them time is suspended and
they take their audience with them

00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.770
into the stories they
tell through dance.

00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:03.370
And, the fourth was the sense
of community that they feel

00:10:03.370 --> 00:10:07.800
and the most open and honest
relationships that they have is

00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.720
with their fellow dancers
and how special that is.

00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:15.020
So, I just felt those thoughts
were so well articulated

00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:19.030
by the Kalanidhi dancers that
we decided to develop work

00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.700
around those four concepts.

00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:22.000
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, you
choreographed [inaudible].

00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:25.320 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: So, I
choreographed around those concepts.

00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:26.620
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Wonderful.

00:10:26.620 --> 00:10:29.280
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: With completely
traditional, classical music

00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.800
which was commissioned
for this project.

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:36.380
I went to India to get the music
recorded, and we choreographed

00:10:36.380 --> 00:10:39.750
and presented it last week.

00:10:39.750 --> 00:10:43.460
And, all of the dancers, we
used their quotes as well

00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.050
as then showed the dance
expressing those sentiments.

00:10:48.050 --> 00:10:50.760
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, where
the quotes were said aloud,

00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.060
or were they?

00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:53.360
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Were said aloud.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:54.660
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Oh, wonderful.

00:10:54.660 --> 00:10:55.960
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: We used
the voices of the dancers.

00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.260
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Oh.

00:10:57.260 --> 00:10:58.560
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.060
So, it, we've come a long way, I
feel, with it's a dream come true

00:11:04.060 --> 00:11:08.700 position:56%
to be able to bring Kuchipudi to the
United States for me, and I truly.

00:11:08.700 --> 00:11:14.100
And, one of our, of my, certainly
my vision and Kalanidhi's vision is

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.440
to try and bring Indian dance,

00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:25.750
to put Indian dance alongside the
mainstream dance in this country.

00:11:25.750 --> 00:11:27.690
I do believe it belongs there.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:28.990 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I think it does.

00:11:28.990 --> 00:11:33.400
I mean it is a, is an
incredible classical form.

00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:39.500
Beautiful, and very
moving even, as you say,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:43.240
if a person is not well
versed in Hindu mythology

00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.870
and the spiritual aspects and
the stories, the narratives

00:11:48.870 --> 00:11:50.530
that out of which it comes.

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:51.830
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah,

00:11:51.830 --> 00:11:55.310
I think there's several layers
of, and of Indian dance.

00:11:55.310 --> 00:12:00.110 position:56%
A lot of depth and complexity to it,
and partly because of, I believe,

00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:03.380
the 2000 years of evolution
and refinement

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:09.080
that this art form has had.

00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.740
But, I also feel it provides us
as Indian dancers an opportunity

00:12:14.740 --> 00:12:22.050
to communicate some of the values
that are reflected in the stories

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:24.210
that we tell through Indian dance

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:29.180
because Indian dance is not
only communicating the stories,

00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:33.240
but it's also communicating
the values of life which is,

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:38.850
which is one of the
purposes of Indian dance.

00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:41.360
And, in our, again,
most recent production,

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:47.740
we tried to bring the meaning
of what it is that we're trying

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:53.860
to portray through our dance
through the use of the surtitles

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.800
where all the lyrics
were translated.

00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:01.510
And so, our audience had an
opportunity to simultaneously,

00:13:01.510 --> 00:13:06.820
to lifetime understand what
it is that we are telling,

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:13.310
whether it be a story or whether
it be, you know, slokas or poetry

00:13:13.310 --> 00:13:20.170
from our, from you know, written
way back from 2000 years ago.

00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:24.740
We took, we took poems
from the Natya Shastra,

00:13:24.740 --> 00:13:27.760
and we presented that.

00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:31.390
And, we had translation
at the same time.

00:13:31.390 --> 00:13:36.880
And so, I do feel all of this
helps bring Indian dance closer

00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:39.410
to our audiences here in America.

00:13:39.410 --> 00:13:40.710
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Sure.

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:43.440
Can you give an example of the
values that, and example of...

00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.740
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: You know, well.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:46.040
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: ...

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.340
or a sloka that would
have something.

00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:48.640
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Sure.

00:13:48.640 --> 00:13:51.910
Yeah. For example, when
we were trying to present

00:13:51.910 --> 00:14:00.970
to our audience the heritage
aspect of our "Why We Dance" work.

00:14:00.970 --> 00:14:04.530
So, some of the values
that we try and teach

00:14:04.530 --> 00:14:07.380
through Indian dance is respect.

00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:13.700
Respect not only and
humility, respect and humility.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:20.810
And, just in terms of how we
begin each class with namaskar

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:26.320 position:56%
which where we remember to offer our
prayers or salutations to the gods

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.250
and then to our teachers.

00:14:28.250 --> 00:14:33.230
And, it reflects in how we, where
we place our hands whether it's,

00:14:33.230 --> 00:14:35.400
when it's above our
head, it's to the gods.

00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:37.650
When it's at our forehead,
it's to our teachers

00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:40.950
because they signify knowledge
or the passing of knowledge.

00:14:40.950 --> 00:14:43.480
And then, when we place our
hands in front of our chest,

00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:47.510
it is offering our prayers
or salutations to all of you

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:50.030
in the audience, for example.

00:14:50.030 --> 00:14:52.960
And then, we respect
for Mother Earth.

00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:57.280
It's extremely important that
we acknowledge Mother Earth

00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:02.030
for all her beauty and
for what she offers us.

00:15:02.030 --> 00:15:06.380
And then, we always start
with doing a namaskar

00:15:06.380 --> 00:15:10.050
to Mother Earth before
we beat upon her.

00:15:10.050 --> 00:15:14.160
And, these are just very,
they're simple gestures,

00:15:14.160 --> 00:15:18.400
but they have a lot of
significance to them.

00:15:18.400 --> 00:15:24.970
And, so, it's teaching, in
this context, yes, Mother Earth

00:15:24.970 --> 00:15:29.990
and teachers and our gods,
but it translates itself to,

00:15:29.990 --> 00:15:33.600
in our daily lives, we have to,
we have to practice humility.

00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:38.840
We have to practice respect, and
those are just some examples.

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:40.140
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's wonderful.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.600
That's very helpful.

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:48.920
I'm curious to know how different
your relationship with Guru Vempati

00:15:48.920 --> 00:15:54.700
as a guru as you were growing up
is, was, what it was like to be

00:15:54.700 --> 00:15:56.590 position:56%
in that classroom and how it differs

00:15:56.590 --> 00:16:00.080
from your relationship
with your students.

00:16:00.080 --> 00:16:03.290
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes,
significantly different.

00:16:03.290 --> 00:16:08.680
Growing up in India, you know,
teachers, we kept, you know,

00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.730
teachers were placed on a
pedestal and highly respected.

00:16:13.730 --> 00:16:17.430
And, of course, my guru
was so knowledgeable,

00:16:17.430 --> 00:16:23.160
and but the big difference
is I feel growing up in India

00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:29.410
and learning dance from him was
amazing, was an amazing experience

00:16:29.410 --> 00:16:33.800
to learn whatever he
had to impart to me.

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:37.140
But, we were never
encouraged to ask questions.

00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:43.080
We just had to be there and absorb
everything that he had to give us,

00:16:43.080 --> 00:16:46.280
and coming to this
country and teaching here,

00:16:46.280 --> 00:16:51.650
children here are not used to
just taking what is given to them.

00:16:51.650 --> 00:16:55.940
So, right from the very beginning,
they would ask questions.

00:16:55.940 --> 00:17:00.300
And, in the early years, it took
a while for me, it was, it was,

00:17:00.300 --> 00:17:03.420
in retrospect the best thing
that could have happened

00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.270
because I learned so
much more through having

00:17:07.270 --> 00:17:09.040
to answer those questions.

00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:16.060
I had to go back and understand
the art form at a much deeper level

00:17:16.060 --> 00:17:19.590
in order to teach them and in
order to answer their questions.

00:17:19.590 --> 00:17:21.480
So, I think that was
a big difference

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:25.540
where asking questions seemed to be
the most natural thing for students

00:17:25.540 --> 00:17:29.850
in this country, and
teaching them required that.

00:17:29.850 --> 00:17:37.850 position:56%
And, I didn't, I didn't demand the
same kind of relationship that I had

00:17:37.850 --> 00:17:43.270
with my guru from my students in
terms of them having to, you know,

00:17:43.270 --> 00:17:46.090
do the namaskar to me every time.

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:51.460
I believed that if they felt
the respect in their hearts,

00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:54.270
then it would show
itself in their actions.

00:17:54.270 --> 00:17:57.360
And, it took time, but,
over time, then they began

00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.910
to realize the value
of their learning.

00:17:59.910 --> 00:18:05.230
It came from their heart rather
than being told to do something,

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:07.540
which is, again, a big difference

00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:13.340
in my teaching experience
with my students.

00:18:13.340 --> 00:18:17.600
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, how old
are the youngest who come to you?

00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:18.940
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: I -- six years.

00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:20.240
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Six.

00:18:20.240 --> 00:18:21.540
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Six
all the way to adult,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:25.720
but I like to start teaching
students from a young age

00:18:25.720 --> 00:18:28.480
because that's the
best time to start.

00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:30.890
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, are they
mostly born in the United States?

00:18:30.890 --> 00:18:32.190
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Oh, yes.

00:18:32.190 --> 00:18:34.420
Almost all of them.

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:42.600
So, they're, yeah, which is why
I feel, it, which is why I was

00:18:42.600 --> 00:18:47.870
so surprised when I saw how
connected they felt to this dance

00:18:47.870 --> 00:18:49.380
because they're not,
they haven't grown

00:18:49.380 --> 00:18:52.280
up in the same culture
that I grew up in.

00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:55.750
But, yet, there is something
in the art form itself

00:18:55.750 --> 00:19:00.350
that makes them connected to very
deeply, and they have a passion

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:06.180
for it which is amazing
for me to watch.

00:19:06.180 --> 00:19:08.740
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: It, you
can see it in the performance.

00:19:08.740 --> 00:19:12.280
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Which is why
I'm so committed to making sure

00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:18.100
that Kalanidhi continues beyond
me and for trying our level best

00:19:18.100 --> 00:19:24.160
to put Kuchipudi up there
alongside other art forms

00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:29.050
because it truly belongs
alongside other art forms

00:19:29.050 --> 00:19:30.350
in this country today.

00:19:30.350 --> 00:19:34.480
I think. And, the next generation
of dancers are passionate enough

00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:38.130
about Kuchipudi that I hope
they'll be able to take it forward.

00:19:38.130 --> 00:19:39.430
Yeah.

00:19:39.430 --> 00:19:40.730
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:19:40.730 --> 00:19:43.290
So, in your teaching, do you,
do you have a range of the ages?

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:48.680
Do the young ones take a class
with the older students, or?

00:19:48.680 --> 00:19:49.980
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: No.

00:19:49.980 --> 00:19:51.280
I do, I do separate them.

00:19:51.280 --> 00:19:53.910
They, I teach in very small groups

00:19:53.910 --> 00:20:00.150
because I feel dancers
best start in small groups.

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:05.310
Kuchipudi is best started in
small groups, but I do offer a,

00:20:05.310 --> 00:20:11.800
what I call a common class or
a combined class once a week

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:19.490
to which students of all levels
are encouraged to attend.

00:20:19.490 --> 00:20:26.100
And, the objective of that
common class is for interaction

00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:30.200 position:56%
between the juniors and the seniors,
for the juniors to be inspired

00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:35.600
by the senior, for them to see
where they're working towards,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:39.570
what is the next level and what is
the best level for them to get to.

00:20:39.570 --> 00:20:46.230
As well as the combined class
allows, allows for, you know,

00:20:46.230 --> 00:20:48.160
other things like stamina building

00:20:48.160 --> 00:20:51.320
because it's a solid
two hour session

00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.810
where all the fundamentals
are reviewed.

00:20:53.810 --> 00:20:58.650
So, it, and I, my attempt was
also to try and simulate the kind

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.300
of classes I used to
have back in India

00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:05.470
where we had all ages come
together at the same time.

00:21:05.470 --> 00:21:06.770
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Oh, really?

00:21:06.770 --> 00:21:09.010
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And,
everybody started together,

00:21:09.010 --> 00:21:14.570
and as the class became more and
more complex, the younger ones sat

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.990
down and watched the older dancers.

00:21:16.990 --> 00:21:19.800
And, that was on an everyday basis.

00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:22.980
Here, it's impossible to do that.

00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:25.750
Students have busy lives.

00:21:25.750 --> 00:21:27.210
Students have busy routines.

00:21:27.210 --> 00:21:30.090
They have many other
activities, and so they often come

00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:35.790
for this one hour a week which
is so secluded, in a sense.

00:21:35.790 --> 00:21:39.620
They just learn their few
steps, and they have no idea

00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:42.460
of what else there
is to Indian dance.

00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.510
So, the combined class
offers them a glimpse.

00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.430
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And
then, some of the students go

00:21:48.430 --> 00:21:51.310
on to have a final performance.

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:52.610
Do they graduate?

00:21:52.610 --> 00:21:53.910
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:21:53.910 --> 00:21:55.340 position:56%
We have what's called rangapravesam.

00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:01.880
A rangapravesam is the literal
meaning of rangapravesam is entry

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.230
to stage, entry onto stage.

00:22:05.230 --> 00:22:09.570
And, it's a debut performance,
a debut solo performance,

00:22:09.570 --> 00:22:15.770
and that usually requires years
of practice because they have

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:24.160
to present a 90 to 100 minute
presentation of dance all alone

00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.810
which requires a lot of training.

00:22:26.810 --> 00:22:31.810
And, typically, that takes 10
to 12 years of training before,

00:22:31.810 --> 00:22:37.100
and that's considered the basic
requirement before you can go

00:22:37.100 --> 00:22:40.320
on to becoming a professional
dancer if you so choose to.

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.870
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Do many of your
students go on to pursue dance,

00:22:44.870 --> 00:22:47.850 position:56%
or how does it fit into their lives?

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.310
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Yeah, so that, that was,

00:22:49.310 --> 00:22:51.420
again, a big surprise for me.

00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:56.830
I think a lot of students
come up to that stage,

00:22:56.830 --> 00:22:59.960
they do their solo performance,
and then they move on.

00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:04.190
But, to me, the surprising
thing about Kalanidhi is a lot

00:23:04.190 --> 00:23:08.120
of my Kalanidhi dancers have
done their rangapravesam,

00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:12.120
but they've wanted to
continue because they,

00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.820
some of them have gone
away and come back.

00:23:14.820 --> 00:23:18.880
And so, I do feel we've developed
this community of dancers

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.560
where there's something that's
pulling them back to dance,

00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:26.590
and I've got a large number of
my company dancers have come back

00:23:26.590 --> 00:23:31.270
after their solo rangapravesam
to join the company

00:23:31.270 --> 00:23:33.310
and to be with the company.

00:23:33.310 --> 00:23:41.190
And, unfortunately, in the
arts, I've been unable to,

00:23:41.190 --> 00:23:44.880
unable to hire them
on a full-time basis

00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.160
because we just can't afford to.

00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:53.000
But, I do know if we can get to
that point, I would have a group

00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:55.930
of dancers who would
dedicate their lives to this.

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:59.910
But, we are Kalanidhi
are working towards that.

00:23:59.910 --> 00:24:06.960
It is our goal to try and develop a
core group at a core dance company

00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:10.830 position:56%
which we can support professionally.

00:24:10.830 --> 00:24:12.130
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's admirable.

00:24:12.130 --> 00:24:13.430
Yeah.

00:24:13.430 --> 00:24:14.730
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:24:14.730 --> 00:24:16.030
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So,
how long has Kalanidhi.

00:24:16.030 --> 00:24:17.330
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Kalanidhi.

00:24:17.330 --> 00:24:20.770
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Kalanidhi
gone, been in existence?

00:24:20.770 --> 00:24:22.070
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: 25 years.

00:24:22.070 --> 00:24:23.370
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: 25 years,
yeah, that's what you said.

00:24:23.370 --> 00:24:24.930
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: We just
had our 25th year celebration.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:30.010
Yeah, '91 is when I
started Kuchipudi Kalanidhi.

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:33.710
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, can you
tell us, what does the word mean?

00:24:33.710 --> 00:24:35.010
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Kalanidhi.

00:24:35.010 --> 00:24:38.460
"Kala" is art, and
"nidhi" is treasure.

00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:45.270
So, it's a treasure of art,
treasure chest of art is the name.

00:24:45.270 --> 00:24:46.570
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:24:46.570 --> 00:24:51.860
Have you traveled with
the group to India?

00:24:51.860 --> 00:24:56.380
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Yes, we did, in 2007.

00:24:56.380 --> 00:24:59.930
There's a festival in India, New
Delhi, called Ananya festival

00:24:59.930 --> 00:25:04.130
which is presented every October
in front of the Purana Qila,

00:25:04.130 --> 00:25:07.820
the Red Fort, one of the most
prestigious dance festivals

00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:13.180
where only Indian dance
groups are, dance companies

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.710
from India are presented.

00:25:15.710 --> 00:25:21.900
So, we felt extremely privileged
and humbled when they invited us

00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.120
to present Kalanidhi dancers
there and Kalanidhi work there.

00:25:26.120 --> 00:25:29.950
So, we did that in 2007, and
we made a tour out of it.

00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:33.870
We traveled the Kalakshetra
and presented there.

00:25:33.870 --> 00:25:36.870
Kalakshetra is the premiere
dance institute in India.

00:25:36.870 --> 00:25:40.810
And, I went to my hometown,
Hyderabad, and presented there.

00:25:40.810 --> 00:25:43.680
So, that was also thrilling for me.

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:45.030
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And,
to the students, too.

00:25:45.030 --> 00:25:46.330
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And,
for the students, too.

00:25:46.330 --> 00:25:47.630
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Very, very.

00:25:47.630 --> 00:25:51.800
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It was an
amazing experience for all of them,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:58.410
and one of the limiting factors
for Kalanidhi today to tour is

00:25:58.410 --> 00:26:04.610
that we don't have a, we're not
able to support dancers full-time.

00:26:04.610 --> 00:26:08.600
And, I do believe once we get
to that stage, we can tour.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:11.420
Touring, we're unable to tour today

00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:13.400
because they all have
other commitments.

00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.840
They're either in college
or they're working.

00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:20.420 position:56%
And, being able to support them
professionally would mean we can not

00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:23.440
only tour overseas, but we
can tour within the country.

00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:24.740
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.040
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Which
we would love to do.

00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.670
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, I'm
sure there are many communities

00:26:27.670 --> 00:26:28.970
who would welcome that.

00:26:28.970 --> 00:26:30.270
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:26:30.270 --> 00:26:32.820
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Throughout
the U.S. they would be fascinated.

00:26:32.820 --> 00:26:35.950
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah because
it takes a lot of time and effort

00:26:35.950 --> 00:26:41.000
to put a work together and to
present it, and then it's a bit

00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.180
of a shame that we're
unable to tour with it.

00:26:45.180 --> 00:26:47.960
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: You've
also done some innovative work

00:26:47.960 --> 00:26:51.630
with musical forms
that are very different

00:26:51.630 --> 00:26:53.870
from Indian classical forms.

00:26:53.870 --> 00:26:55.680
Could you talk a little
bit about that?

00:26:55.680 --> 00:26:56.980
[BEGIN]

00:26:56.980 --> 00:26:58.280
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Sure.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:04.340
Yeah. It, you know, even, it was
in 2012 that we were approached

00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:07.410
by the Artistic Director
of Opera Lafayette,

00:27:07.410 --> 00:27:12.810 position:56%
Ryan Brown, to collaborate with him.

00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:17.680
And, even before then,
Kalanidhi, in Kalanidhi,

00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.120
we were always experimenting
the different genres of music

00:27:22.120 --> 00:27:27.990
and we would choreograph to fill
up class, and we would choreograph

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:30.050
to different forms of music.

00:27:30.050 --> 00:27:32.630
So, there was this interest and --

00:27:32.630 --> 00:27:35.580
to experiment with the
different kinds of music.

00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:41.470 position:56%
And, we put up some of our videos on
the web, and Ryan Brown saw a couple

00:27:41.470 --> 00:27:46.280
of our videos on the web and liked
what he saw and contacted us.

00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:53.470
And, that's how this opportunity
came to us, and as a result

00:27:53.470 --> 00:27:58.700
of meeting with Ryan Brown, we
ended up collaborating with him

00:27:58.700 --> 00:28:07.750
in two operas which was a
fabulous experience for us.

00:28:07.750 --> 00:28:15.140
We worked on a 19th century opera
called Lalla Roukh and presented

00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:18.980
with his opera company in 2013.

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:24.210
And then, on a second
opera work in 2014

00:28:24.210 --> 00:28:26.210
which was based on Rameau's work.

00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:29.880
And, both of them were
fabulous experiences.

00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:34.540
The second work, not
only was a collaboration

00:28:34.540 --> 00:28:40.530
with the opera company, but he
invited two other dance companies,

00:28:40.530 --> 00:28:44.530
a modern dance company as well
as a baroque dance company

00:28:44.530 --> 00:28:48.300
and had the three dance
companies work with each other.

00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:51.100
So, it was a fabulous
collaborative effort where --

00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.650
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
So, dancing to Rameau?

00:28:52.650 --> 00:28:54.420
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Dancing to Rameau.

00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:55.720
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Amazing.

00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:57.020
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And
interacting and choreographing

00:28:57.020 --> 00:29:00.550
with a modern dance company
choreographer as well

00:29:00.550 --> 00:29:03.170
as a baroque dance
company choreographer.

00:29:03.170 --> 00:29:06.330
So, it was a really
exciting collaboration,

00:29:06.330 --> 00:29:09.990
and I do believe we
all pulled it off.

00:29:09.990 --> 00:29:13.090
It came out -- we enjoyed it.

00:29:13.090 --> 00:29:16.700
We thoroughly, thoroughly
learned a lot from each other

00:29:16.700 --> 00:29:22.580
and enjoyed the whole
process of working together,

00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:30.080
working with each other, and I
really, really hope that this opens

00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:33.990 position:56%
up avenues, not just for Kalanidhi
but for Indian dance in this country

00:29:33.990 --> 00:29:38.740
to work with not only
other musical forms

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:41.030
but with other dance forms as well.

00:29:41.030 --> 00:29:42.820
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's so exciting, and.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:44.190
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Truly exciting.

00:29:44.190 --> 00:29:46.380
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, it
would be so easy to say, well,

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:50.580
I don't think it would
work, and yet, it did.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:51.880
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It did.

00:29:51.880 --> 00:29:53.180
Yes.

00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:54.480 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: In amazing ways.

00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:55.780
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It did.

00:29:55.780 --> 00:29:57.610
Because, yeah, ultimately,
I do believe music

00:29:57.610 --> 00:30:02.110
and dance are universal
languages, and it is.

00:30:02.110 --> 00:30:07.040
And, what better way to
bridge the cultural gap?

00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:08.340
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Exactly, yeah.

00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:12.170
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Other than,
yeah, music and dance, I think.

00:30:12.170 --> 00:30:17.510 position:56%
It provides us a perfect opportunity
to, not only create artistic work

00:30:17.510 --> 00:30:21.650
but to understand each other's
culture in this process.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:24.440
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, when
the group traveled to India,

00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:28.880
was it mostly traditional classical
Indian music that you danced to?

00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:30.180
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, yes.

00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:35.400 position:56%
We took a work called "Rasa" which
was an exploration of the nine moods

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:38.420
as described in the Natya Shastra,

00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:42.120
but these nine moods are
universal to mankind.

00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:47.650
And so, we, the experimentation
in that work was to try

00:30:47.650 --> 00:30:53.460
and depict these nine emotions
with abstract Indian dance

00:30:53.460 --> 00:30:55.210
as opposed to storytelling.

00:30:55.210 --> 00:31:00.140
The traditional way to depict
the nine moods is to select, say,

00:31:00.140 --> 00:31:06.380
poetry or to select stories in
which that sentiment exists.

00:31:06.380 --> 00:31:10.700
But, we did that, but in
addition to that, we experimented

00:31:10.700 --> 00:31:14.030
with an abstract depiction
of the nine moods.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:16.060
And, that was the work
we took to India.

00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.930
So, it was with, to Indian music.

00:31:18.930 --> 00:31:23.390
We commissioned that work also
where it was an Indian composer.

00:31:23.390 --> 00:31:27.190 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, with facial,
I mean, there's a lot of gesture.

00:31:27.190 --> 00:31:29.000 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: A lot of gesture.

00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.630
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, hand
mudras, and also facial --

00:31:33.630 --> 00:31:34.930
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes.

00:31:34.930 --> 00:31:36.230
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Expressions.

00:31:36.230 --> 00:31:37.530
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:31:37.530 --> 00:31:38.830 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: You worked with.

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:40.130
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: We have
an entire language of gesture

00:31:40.130 --> 00:31:44.300 position:56%
that forms our vocabulary of
movement for us to tell our stories,

00:31:44.300 --> 00:31:47.740
and that's supplemented
with facial expressions.

00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:54.290
Facial expressions is a key
part of storytelling for us.

00:31:54.290 --> 00:31:57.620
We use the combination of
the language of gesture

00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.420
as well as facial expressions.

00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:08.780
But, in this work called "Rasa",
we did that, but we extended it to,

00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:14.590
so for say, let's take
sadness, Karunyam.

00:32:14.590 --> 00:32:22.750
We used a story to depict sadness,
and then we continued the work

00:32:22.750 --> 00:32:29.220
by using just movement of
the body to express sadness.

00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:35.070
And, because I, as I said earlier,
I do believe even just the movement

00:32:35.070 --> 00:32:37.810
of the body, the vocabulary

00:32:37.810 --> 00:32:43.840
of the actual entire body
movement itself is very expressive.

00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:47.300
Besides having, in
addition to that language

00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:49.460
of gesture and facial expressions.

00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.530
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, is there a
difference in performing in Indian

00:32:54.530 --> 00:32:59.660 position:56%
with an Indian audience who has some
concept of the heritage of Kuchipudi

00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:02.060
as opposed to an audience here?

00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:03.360
And, how is that as --

00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:04.660
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes.

00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:06.180
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: As a
performer and a choreographer?

00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:07.480
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:09.130
Yeah. It's a very good question.

00:33:09.130 --> 00:33:12.720
I mean, for years, I've
struggled with this.

00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:17.410 position:56%
It's always easier to dance in India
because there's so much context,

00:33:17.410 --> 00:33:19.700
and the audience just gets it.

00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:26.560
They, having, you know, been
brought up in the same culture.

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.880
Performing in America
has been very challenging

00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:33.470 position:56%
because there's so much that's lost.

00:33:33.470 --> 00:33:40.950 position:56%
People don't understand the language
of the poetry, of the lyrics.

00:33:40.950 --> 00:33:43.880
They don't understand,
necessarily, the music itself.

00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.250
They don't understand
the language of gestures.

00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:52.270
So, it's a lot was lost, and so
we tried to supplement our dance

00:33:52.270 --> 00:33:57.550
with extensive narratives
or narration, you know,

00:33:57.550 --> 00:34:02.220
just explaining each dance before
dancing it which helped somewhat.

00:34:02.220 --> 00:34:04.040
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Sure.

00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:09.920
To some extent, and now, more
recently because we've experimented

00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:13.570
with surtitles, I think
that's even more,

00:34:13.570 --> 00:34:16.870
brings Indian dance even closer.

00:34:16.870 --> 00:34:25.360
But, I also do believe that we
could bring Indian dance closer

00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:31.170
to our audiences just, you
know, without necessarily having

00:34:31.170 --> 00:34:33.620
to explain it extensively.

00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:43.320 position:56%
But, we've got to get there in terms
of how we choreograph Indian dance.

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:48.860
And, there are ways to just enjoy
it without necessarily having

00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:53.740
to spell it out, and I
think it'll get there.

00:34:53.740 --> 00:34:55.040
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I
could imagine, you know,

00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.700 position:56%
I could imagine surtitles could
help, but they could also, in a way,

00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:03.110
come in the way of just responding.

00:35:03.110 --> 00:35:04.410
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah, so it--

00:35:04.410 --> 00:35:05.880 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: To the artistry.

00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.540
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah,
so that is a struggle.

00:35:07.540 --> 00:35:11.620
That is a struggle, and I
think surtitles should not be,

00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:15.510
should be used minimally
and not too extensively.

00:35:15.510 --> 00:35:20.290
Just to give context as
opposed to if it's overused,

00:35:20.290 --> 00:35:23.620
then the audience will be
reading rather than watching.

00:35:23.620 --> 00:35:28.190
And so, there has to be a fine
balance, and that's all part

00:35:28.190 --> 00:35:29.890
of the learning process, I think.

00:35:29.890 --> 00:35:32.110
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's fascinating.

00:35:32.110 --> 00:35:35.510
Could you speak a little
bit about the jewelry

00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:39.370
and the makeup and the costume?

00:35:39.370 --> 00:35:40.670
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:35:40.670 --> 00:35:41.970 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: For performance.

00:35:41.970 --> 00:35:43.590
It's a very distinctive costume.

00:35:43.590 --> 00:35:46.260
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, and
that's largely because of

00:35:46.260 --> 00:35:49.040
where Indian dance originated.

00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:55.300
It was a temple dance form,
and so it's pretty elaborate.

00:35:55.300 --> 00:36:00.080
But, the costuming and the
ornamentation is quite elaborate,

00:36:00.080 --> 00:36:06.590
has always been where the
dancer was seen as a devadasi

00:36:06.590 --> 00:36:15.050
or the dancer was dancing for
the gods and so was dressed

00:36:15.050 --> 00:36:18.460
in this fashion for that purpose.

00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:22.360
But, and we've, to a large extent,

00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.480
continued that tradition
of dressing.

00:36:26.480 --> 00:36:31.810
Although, in many more contemporary
Indian dance works today,

00:36:31.810 --> 00:36:36.970
you see a lot of simplification
to the ornamentation.

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:43.650
And, I think it adds, it
adds to the dance form

00:36:43.650 --> 00:36:47.160
in certain contexts,
but it's not critical.

00:36:47.160 --> 00:36:49.760
I do believe it's not critical.

00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:54.210
I do believe we ourselves,
even at Kalanidhi have,

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:57.840
when we've presented dances
which have more secular themes

00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.540
which are more social
themes, we've moved away

00:37:01.540 --> 00:37:07.310
from the very elaborate
costuming and ornamentation

00:37:07.310 --> 00:37:09.160
because it just doesn't go.

00:37:09.160 --> 00:37:14.590 position:56%
It does go with the more traditional
dancing, but not necessarily

00:37:14.590 --> 00:37:21.310
with the more social context,
contextual dances that we present.

00:37:21.310 --> 00:37:25.360 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Do you have any
young men who are studying with you?

00:37:25.360 --> 00:37:27.340
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: This has
been another big challenge.

00:37:27.340 --> 00:37:32.330
I've had several boys start
learning dance and one

00:37:32.330 --> 00:37:37.210
or two became excellent, but
it's just tragic that all

00:37:37.210 --> 00:37:40.160
of my boy students give
up in middle school.

00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:41.460
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:43.420
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: The social
pressures are enormous,

00:37:43.420 --> 00:37:47.050
and it's tragic that
they all give up.

00:37:47.050 --> 00:37:52.230
So, it, no, I'm an all-female
dance company as of today.

00:37:52.230 --> 00:37:53.530
Yeah.

00:37:53.530 --> 00:37:54.830
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:37:54.830 --> 00:37:56.130
So, in India, are there students?

00:37:56.130 --> 00:37:57.430
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes.

00:37:57.430 --> 00:37:58.730
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Are
there male students?

00:37:58.730 --> 00:38:00.030
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, there are.

00:38:00.030 --> 00:38:03.360
But, still in the minority, but
there are several male students,

00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:07.410
and they're beautiful to watch.

00:38:07.410 --> 00:38:11.480
I brought two male dancers for
my production last weekend,

00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.650
one from India and one from
another part of the United States.

00:38:15.650 --> 00:38:18.550
It just adds-- because
there's a certain energy

00:38:18.550 --> 00:38:21.740
that male dancers bring
to Indian dance

00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:24.690 position:56%
that female dancers don't and can't.

00:38:24.690 --> 00:38:25.990
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Or together.

00:38:25.990 --> 00:38:27.290
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
And, together, yeah.

00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:30.720
We dance together,
and it just adds a lot

00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:34.280
to the energy and to the dance.

00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.540
But, no, I haven't been successful.

00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:37.840
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: No.

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:42.290
I can imagine that it would
be very, very difficult.

00:38:42.290 --> 00:38:43.590
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:38:43.590 --> 00:38:47.790
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Has the dance
form changed as it becomes more

00:38:47.790 --> 00:38:50.910
of a woman's tradition, or?

00:38:50.910 --> 00:38:52.210
I just wonder because--

00:38:52.210 --> 00:38:53.510
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:38:53.510 --> 00:38:54.840
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: It
seems like a huge change,

00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.800
did you say, in 75 years.

00:38:56.800 --> 00:38:58.600 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: In 75 years, yes.

00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.630
I think it has changed.

00:39:00.630 --> 00:39:10.090
It's, there is definitely more
of the softer, graceful movements

00:39:10.090 --> 00:39:13.490
that you see more of a predominance

00:39:13.490 --> 00:39:20.520
of the more graceful movements
in our repertoire today.

00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.810
Although we haven't
given up on the vibrancy.

00:39:22.810 --> 00:39:24.380
I mean, that's the
beauty of Kuchipudi.

00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:25.680
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Oh, no.

00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:29.270
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It has,
it has very vibrant, dynamic,

00:39:29.270 --> 00:39:35.430
strong movement vocabulary, but at
the same time, it has this very,

00:39:35.430 --> 00:39:38.430
very graceful, soft
movement as well.

00:39:38.430 --> 00:39:41.140
And, it is the confluence
of these two

00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:43.670
that make Kuchipudi
special, I think.

00:39:43.670 --> 00:39:49.850
And, and I think, just because it's
female practitioners, we, perhaps,

00:39:49.850 --> 00:39:55.110
it looks slightly different today
than it would have 75 years ago

00:39:55.110 --> 00:39:56.410
with an all-male dance form.

00:39:56.410 --> 00:40:01.310
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, the
main gurus in India now,

00:40:01.310 --> 00:40:05.100
are they still male, or
are they also female?

00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.980
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah,
there's still a lot

00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:14.190
of male Kuchipudi gurus,
interestingly.

00:40:14.190 --> 00:40:22.960
We do have female teachers as
well, but still, in the village

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:26.670
of Kuchipudi, for example,
today, we have mostly male gurus.

00:40:26.670 --> 00:40:27.970
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Really?

00:40:27.970 --> 00:40:29.270
I see.

00:40:29.270 --> 00:40:30.570
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Mostly, they're all male.

00:40:30.570 --> 00:40:34.590
Not to say that there aren't female
teachers elsewhere in the country,

00:40:34.590 --> 00:40:35.900
elsewhere in the country.

00:40:35.900 --> 00:40:40.200
In the cities, we have a
lot of female gurus, but,

00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:44.690
still in the heartland of
Kuchipudi, it's all male dominated.

00:40:44.690 --> 00:40:45.990
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Interesting.

00:40:45.990 --> 00:40:49.940
So, it was originally male
dominated where they performed as,

00:40:49.940 --> 00:40:52.160
they performed in women's roles.

00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:54.200
Now, it's reversed, in a sense.

00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:55.500
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It is.

00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:58.170
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: In your
school and in other contexts.

00:40:58.170 --> 00:40:59.470
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It is.

00:40:59.470 --> 00:41:01.810
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Where they're,
the young women are portraying.

00:41:01.810 --> 00:41:03.400
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Portraying male characters.

00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:04.860
It's taken a full circle.

00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:06.160
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.460
Yeah.

00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.760
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.320
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I understand
that there are different strains

00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:13.300
of Kuchipudi that are
currently taught.

00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:18.540
With Vempati how would
you characterize his,

00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:23.940
his distinctive expression
of Kuchipudi dance?

00:41:23.940 --> 00:41:25.240
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: I think

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:35.390 position:56%
when Vempati Chinna Satyam has
definitely moved away from the style

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:38.070
that he had learned in
the village of Kuchipudi.

00:41:38.070 --> 00:41:39.370
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Really?

00:41:39.370 --> 00:41:40.670
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:41:40.670 --> 00:41:47.240
He was hugely influenced by the
dance scene in Madras those days.

00:41:47.240 --> 00:41:54.480
He had moved to Chennai
in the '50s, 1950s,

00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:59.720
and Bharatanatyam there was a huge
revival of Bharatanatyam in Madras.

00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:03.750
So, I keep interchanging Madras
and Chennai because in the '50s,

00:42:03.750 --> 00:42:05.690
Madras, it was known as Madras.

00:42:05.690 --> 00:42:13.850 position:56%
It's today known as Chennai, but and
so, there was a lot of excitement

00:42:13.850 --> 00:42:17.810
with the revival of
Bharatanatyam in Madras.

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:24.100
And so, he got to see a lot of
Bharatanatyam there in Madras

00:42:24.100 --> 00:42:27.180
and was influenced,
definitely, by it.

00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:40.410 position:56%
And, I think that definitely changed
his sense of aesthetics and he also,

00:42:40.410 --> 00:42:44.310
by introducing women
to the dance form,

00:42:44.310 --> 00:42:48.820
also the dance form did
change a little bit.

00:42:48.820 --> 00:42:58.060
And, he spent a lot of time
in removing certain aspects

00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:03.910
of the dance drama form that he
felt was not being received as well

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:09.720
in Madras those days and
evolved the solo form in a way

00:43:09.720 --> 00:43:14.520
that was more appealing to
the audiences in Madras.

00:43:14.520 --> 00:43:16.660
And so, yes, Vempati
Chinna Satyam's style

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.960 position:56%
of Kuchipudi is distinctly different
from the other guru's styles

00:43:21.960 --> 00:43:28.290
that you see even today,
both in India and abroad.

00:43:28.290 --> 00:43:33.330
And, it's very recognizable
difference to the dance,

00:43:33.330 --> 00:43:35.900
Indian classical dance aficionados.

00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:37.200
But, to a non --

00:43:37.200 --> 00:43:39.500
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: How
would you describe it?

00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:47.360
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: So, it's, I
mean, without, it's much easier

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:56.480 position:56%
to describe it with a demonstration,
but in words, I think, for example,

00:43:56.480 --> 00:44:02.990
he took away the whole
spoken, the dialogues.

00:44:02.990 --> 00:44:08.080
So, part of Kuchipudi tradition
was to have the spoken word

00:44:08.080 --> 00:44:10.460
as part of the production.

00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:14.610
Dancers would not only
come and sing on stage,

00:44:14.610 --> 00:44:16.430
but they would speak on stage.

00:44:16.430 --> 00:44:17.730
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Oh.

00:44:17.730 --> 00:44:19.120
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: So, it
was, it was very theatrical.

00:44:19.120 --> 00:44:23.250
So, there would be a lot
of drama as well as dance.

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:27.170
They would, they would speak
as well as go and dance.

00:44:27.170 --> 00:44:28.790
So, they would do both,

00:44:28.790 --> 00:44:34.320
and Vempati's significant
intervention was

00:44:34.320 --> 00:44:39.630
to remove the spoken
word almost completely.

00:44:39.630 --> 00:44:43.980
He would, even if there
was the spoken word as part

00:44:43.980 --> 00:44:46.480
of the production, it
would be sung by a singer.

00:44:46.480 --> 00:44:50.470
It would not be recited or
sung or spoken by the dancer.

00:44:50.470 --> 00:44:54.510
So, that was definitely
a big change, and he,

00:44:54.510 --> 00:44:59.310
some would say he refined
the movements.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.170
Others would argue against it.

00:45:02.170 --> 00:45:06.390 position:56%
It depends on who you're talking to.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:10.310
And, I think his primary
contribution, also,

00:45:10.310 --> 00:45:15.990
has been to create
solo work which a lot

00:45:15.990 --> 00:45:21.910
of the other gurus
had not, have not.

00:45:21.910 --> 00:45:26.500
They've taken parts of the
dance drama, drama works,

00:45:26.500 --> 00:45:28.970
and they've presented as solos,

00:45:28.970 --> 00:45:33.660
but they have not independently
choreographed solos.

00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:34.960
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I see.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.260
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.920
I'm talking about in
his time, not today.

00:45:37.920 --> 00:45:42.530
So, that was a huge difference
where a lot of his body

00:45:42.530 --> 00:45:51.580
of work had new solo dancers
created by him to poetry

00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:57.650
that extended beyond
the poems and the songs

00:45:57.650 --> 00:46:00.760
that were used traditionally
in the Kuchipudi village.

00:46:00.760 --> 00:46:04.500
And, he was the first
Kuchipudi guru that also,

00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:11.090
that also choreographed an entire
dance drama that had a social theme

00:46:11.090 --> 00:46:13.620
to it and not a religious
theme to it.

00:46:13.620 --> 00:46:18.790
He addressed the whole caste
system, based his production

00:46:18.790 --> 00:46:21.430
on Rabindranath Tagore's work.

00:46:21.430 --> 00:46:22.730
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Really?

00:46:22.730 --> 00:46:27.410
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, so he
had this incredible courage.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:28.710
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:46:28.710 --> 00:46:33.160 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: To, and he,
singularly, I think, was responsible

00:46:33.160 --> 00:46:36.500
for bringing Kuchipudi
out of the village, A,

00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:39.680
and made it popular
around the world.

00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.340
He was immensely popular
in his time.

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:45.320
He took his productions
around the world.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.620
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I see.

00:46:46.620 --> 00:46:47.920
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:46:47.920 --> 00:46:49.650
Europe, America, Australia,
everywhere.

00:46:49.650 --> 00:46:55.350
Yeah, he was singularly responsible
for popularizing Kuchipudi,

00:46:55.350 --> 00:46:58.280
I would say, in his time.

00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.840
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Because
I was under the impression

00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:04.240
that for a while Kuchipudi
had to, had to really show

00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:06.620
that it was a classical
art form and not.

00:47:06.620 --> 00:47:07.920
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Exactly.

00:47:07.920 --> 00:47:09.870
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: A folk
form, which it certainly is not.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:11.250
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Exactly.

00:47:11.250 --> 00:47:17.620 position:56%
Yeah, and I think, I think Vempati
Chinna Satyam contributed enormously

00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.760
to that legacy and to fight

00:47:21.760 --> 00:47:27.360
for its place amongst the
classical dances in India.

00:47:27.360 --> 00:47:28.880
Yeah.

00:47:28.880 --> 00:47:30.180
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Remarkable.

00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.480
Yeah.

00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:35.000
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: But, you know,
the spoken word is not, it's still,

00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:39.370
I think, a strong component
of Kuchipudi today, and we,

00:47:39.370 --> 00:47:46.220
not only Kuchipudi artists are
finding ways to incorporate it

00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:52.500 position:56%
into their productions, but other
forms have adopted that as well now.

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:57.810
We see Bharatanatyam and other
dance forms using the spoken word

00:47:57.810 --> 00:48:00.040
and incorporating that
as an element.

00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:03.410
And, I don't see why not because
it is in the Natya Shastra.

00:48:03.410 --> 00:48:07.320
The Natya Shastra speaks
about the four different kinds

00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:13.360
of expressions being vachika which
is spoken being ornamentation

00:48:13.360 --> 00:48:20.830
or costuming, being sattvika which
is more expression of the soul

00:48:20.830 --> 00:48:22.630
and expression through gesture.

00:48:22.630 --> 00:48:28.700
So, they've outlined four different
forms of expression, and so really,

00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:34.200
it's open to any classical Indian
dance form to use these elements

00:48:34.200 --> 00:48:38.780
as part of their productions
or performance.

00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:43.700
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, is that
Telugu for your students, or?

00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.000
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Not necessarily.

00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:46.870
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Are many
of them Telugu speakers?

00:48:46.870 --> 00:48:49.720
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, I
have a lot of Telugu speakers,

00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:52.380
but I also have a lot
of non-Telugu speakers.

00:48:52.380 --> 00:48:53.680 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I would imagine.

00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.980
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Amongst my students.

00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:57.540
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, the
spoken word would be English, or?

00:48:57.540 --> 00:48:59.070
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Today it's English.

00:48:59.070 --> 00:49:02.490
Today, it's English because
that is the unifying language.

00:49:02.490 --> 00:49:04.330
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
Of course, yeah, yeah.

00:49:04.330 --> 00:49:07.540 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, it
doesn't, yeah, and I think it's fine

00:49:07.540 --> 00:49:11.890
because it's, it's
language that is used,

00:49:11.890 --> 00:49:13.590
it's a spoken word that's used.

00:49:13.590 --> 00:49:17.370
Which language that spoken word
is in is almost irrelevant.

00:49:17.370 --> 00:49:18.670
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:49:18.670 --> 00:49:19.970
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: As long
as it helps to communicate.

00:49:19.970 --> 00:49:21.270
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Exactly.

00:49:21.270 --> 00:49:22.570 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: To our audiences.

00:49:22.570 --> 00:49:23.870
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

00:49:23.870 --> 00:49:26.670
So, you mentioned how Vempati
sort of pushed the boundaries

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:30.020
in terms of social issues.

00:49:30.020 --> 00:49:35.510
In a sense, you've also followed
in his footsteps in that.

00:49:35.510 --> 00:49:39.570
Could you talk a little
bit about that?

00:49:39.570 --> 00:49:41.090
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Sure.

00:49:41.090 --> 00:49:47.670
I'm sure it has impacted
itself on me.

00:49:47.670 --> 00:49:51.090
I, in fact, one of my,
one of his most favorite,

00:49:51.090 --> 00:49:53.660
one of my most favorite
productions from all

00:49:53.660 --> 00:49:55.830
of his productions is Chandalika,

00:49:55.830 --> 00:49:58.120
which is the one with
the social theme.

00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:02.790
I just, because I connected to it
so deeply, and I always believed

00:50:02.790 --> 00:50:05.790
that the dance form
has enough depth to it

00:50:05.790 --> 00:50:09.290 position:56%
that it can communicate any concept,

00:50:09.290 --> 00:50:12.050
not necessarily just
religious concepts.

00:50:12.050 --> 00:50:17.540
And so, yes, part of, part
of my personal objective

00:50:17.540 --> 00:50:24.540
and Kalanidhi's objective is to
push the boundaries of the art form

00:50:24.540 --> 00:50:30.430
and to be able to make Kuchipudi
more accessible to a wider

00:50:30.430 --> 00:50:36.650
and more diverse audience and
bring it closer to the people

00:50:36.650 --> 00:50:41.990
that we present, present
Kuchipudi to.

00:50:41.990 --> 00:50:46.120
Yes, and that I think
that's probably why,

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.410
from the very early stages of
when the company was formed,

00:50:49.410 --> 00:50:53.410
we were constantly looking
for ways to experiment

00:50:53.410 --> 00:50:56.830
with not only different forms
of music, but even concepts.

00:50:56.830 --> 00:51:03.270
We did a few, a couple of
pieces on women's rights.

00:51:03.270 --> 00:51:05.970
We took music.

00:51:05.970 --> 00:51:09.730
Again, the music for that
was very much Indian.

00:51:09.730 --> 00:51:15.420
It was an Indian album that was
created around women's rights

00:51:15.420 --> 00:51:20.120
by a social, by a nonprofit
organization

00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:26.330 position:56%
in India called Breakthrough, and
it was just, it touched me so deeply

00:51:26.330 --> 00:51:31.960
that we wanted to experiment
choreographing to that music.

00:51:31.960 --> 00:51:38.370
And so, I think, ultimately,
we need to use the art form

00:51:38.370 --> 00:51:44.320
to express what we feel and what
we connect to in our hearts.

00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:54.460
So, and this art form, this dance
style, offers that vocabulary to us

00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:59.200
to express whatever it is we want
to express and to push boundaries

00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.570
and to bring it closer
to our audience.

00:52:02.570 --> 00:52:03.870
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Well, I can.

00:52:03.870 --> 00:52:05.170
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Am
I repeating myself?

00:52:05.170 --> 00:52:06.470
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Well, I
can imagine for your young,

00:52:06.470 --> 00:52:11.090
the young women that this is
very validating and very, very,

00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:14.090 position:56%
very important in our culture today.

00:52:14.090 --> 00:52:20.690
Now, almost more than ever,
just seeking validity as women

00:52:20.690 --> 00:52:28.330
and what our role is and our, and
so, thisis, yeah, so admirable.

00:52:28.330 --> 00:52:29.670
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru:
Absolutely, and I think,

00:52:29.670 --> 00:52:35.170
I think partly why Kalanidhi dance
is able to draw its dancers back

00:52:35.170 --> 00:52:40.060
to it, they want to come back to
it because they see that we are,

00:52:40.060 --> 00:52:42.750
they find it relevant
to their lives.

00:52:42.750 --> 00:52:48.140
They are able to, themselves,
experiment with the things

00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:50.560
that they connect to
using Kuchipudi.

00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:56.670
In fact, one of my dancers has
collaborated with a hip-hop artist

00:52:56.670 --> 00:53:00.500
and she presented a project
called the Nayika Project,

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.800
and it was an amazing collaboration

00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:08.810
where two completely different
art forms, hip hop and Kuchipudi,

00:53:08.810 --> 00:53:12.850 position:56%
came together to explore the Nayika.

00:53:12.850 --> 00:53:19.480
The Nayika Project was about the
different types of women, you know.

00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.910
There are different types of
women that has been described

00:53:24.910 --> 00:53:27.000
in great detail in
the Natya Shastra.

00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.090
You know, the daring woman, the
woman who is devious or, you know,

00:53:33.090 --> 00:53:34.950
there are different
categories of women

00:53:34.950 --> 00:53:37.700
that were elaborated
in the Natya Shastra.

00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:43.610 position:56%
So, Chitra, my, one of my company
dancers, took this and, this concept

00:53:43.610 --> 00:53:47.670
and collaborated with
a hip-hop artist.

00:53:47.670 --> 00:53:51.830
This is great, so I just feel
that the next, it's endless.

00:53:51.830 --> 00:53:56.530
The potential and possibilities
are endless, and that is why it's

00:53:56.530 --> 00:54:01.350 position:56%
so exciting for Kalanidhi dancers
that here we are at Kalanidhi trying

00:54:01.350 --> 00:54:09.900
to provide a platform for them
to take off and to experiment

00:54:09.900 --> 00:54:14.180
and to find meaning
through Kuchipudi.

00:54:14.180 --> 00:54:15.480
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And,
to make it their own.

00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:16.780
Yeah.

00:54:16.780 --> 00:54:18.730
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And to make it
their own, to make it relevant.

00:54:18.730 --> 00:54:20.690
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
And meaningful, yeah.

00:54:20.690 --> 00:54:24.430 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, that is the
only way, I think, for this art form

00:54:24.430 --> 00:54:29.690
to survive and flourish
in this new home.

00:54:29.690 --> 00:54:30.990
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
Very exciting, yeah.

00:54:30.990 --> 00:54:32.290
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: That it's found.

00:54:32.290 --> 00:54:34.760
Yeah, that was a very tough time.

00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:38.720
We went through two tough
periods in its history.

00:54:38.720 --> 00:54:44.350
[laughs] And, one was, yeah,
in '98, '98 to 2002 was

00:54:44.350 --> 00:54:49.210
when my husband got a transfer to
Indonesia, and I left for that,

00:54:49.210 --> 00:54:51.220
for the sake of the family.

00:54:51.220 --> 00:54:55.500
And, at that time we were
just still very much a school,

00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:58.980
and it was still very
tough, very hard to leave.

00:54:58.980 --> 00:55:04.900
And, when I came back in 2002, I
did not have any idea what I wanted

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:10.000
to do because I was little older
now in 2002, and I wasn't sure

00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.530
if I was ready to start with
six year olds all over again.

00:55:13.530 --> 00:55:19.070 position:56%
And, but my senior dancers came back
and said, "You don't have a choice.

00:55:19.070 --> 00:55:24.040
We're waiting for you to restart,
and we need to come back to dance."

00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:28.740
And so, I restarted in 2002,
and I mean, Kalanidhi --

00:55:28.740 --> 00:55:33.460
Kuchipudi Kalanidhi was a nonprofit
organization that was incorporated

00:55:33.460 --> 00:55:37.090
in '91, and so that
was not closed down.

00:55:37.090 --> 00:55:39.470
Meaning, we were, we
became inactive,

00:55:39.470 --> 00:55:41.940
but I just picked it
up and restarted.

00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.410
Yeah. In 2003, I restarted.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:50.650
And, 2005 was when the company
was formed with my senior dancers.

00:55:50.650 --> 00:55:52.600
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And,
what year did you first come

00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.900
to the Washington area?

00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:56.980
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: I
first came in '86, yeah.

00:55:56.980 --> 00:56:01.320
So, I was informally teaching
once a week at an Indian school,

00:56:01.320 --> 00:56:06.550
India School it was called, once
a week from '87 onwards, actually.

00:56:06.550 --> 00:56:08.860
But, I incorporated
Kalanidhi in '91.

00:56:08.860 --> 00:56:10.160
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: '91.

00:56:10.160 --> 00:56:11.460
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:14.650
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen (off camera): What
are your plans for the future now

00:56:14.650 --> 00:56:21.800
that you've gotten your
25 year celebration?

00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:23.350
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah, so yeah.

00:56:23.350 --> 00:56:31.420
We have used the 25th year
celebrations to kind of introspect

00:56:31.420 --> 00:56:37.180
as to what next for Kalanidhi, in
a sense, and because we, today,

00:56:37.180 --> 00:56:44.760
have a group of very passionate
dancers that are part of Kalanidhi,

00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:51.280
it's become our objective to
try and make it self-sustaining,

00:56:51.280 --> 00:56:58.770
to in a way that would allow them
to continue to practice Kuchipudi

00:56:58.770 --> 00:57:03.660
and continue to teach it to the
successive generations of dancers.

00:57:03.660 --> 00:57:08.210
So, we have a very
clear goal in mind.

00:57:08.210 --> 00:57:13.660 position:56%
It's a very ambitious goal, to, we
don't know if we, we definitely want

00:57:13.660 --> 00:57:19.330
to start on its path of creating a
center for Kalanidhi where Indian,

00:57:19.330 --> 00:57:21.450
where Kuchipudi can be taught

00:57:21.450 --> 00:57:26.530
and new work can be
created and presented.

00:57:26.530 --> 00:57:31.080
We plan to start on
that process now,

00:57:31.080 --> 00:57:35.600
and we'll see where we get with it.

00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.900
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's ambitious.

00:57:36.900 --> 00:57:38.200
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Very ambitious.

00:57:38.200 --> 00:57:42.780
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I mean, it's
a wonderful goal, but I'm thinking

00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:47.830
of the atmosphere in the
arts community sometimes

00:57:47.830 --> 00:57:53.970
that is not always supported as
well as it really should be, and--

00:57:53.970 --> 00:57:55.270
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:57:55.270 --> 00:57:57.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And that's, so
it's a huge struggle and a challenge

00:57:57.920 --> 00:58:01.700
to do, to continue with
even excellent art.

00:58:01.700 --> 00:58:03.000
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Right.

00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:04.300
It is. It is a huge challenge.

00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:08.630
We completely recognize
how big a challenge it is,

00:58:08.630 --> 00:58:10.720
but we have to have a dream.

00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:12.020
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Of course.

00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.320
Of course.

00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.620
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, if
we don't have the dream,

00:58:14.620 --> 00:58:18.440
we can't even begin working
towards attaining the dream.

00:58:18.440 --> 00:58:21.640
And, we have a passion that,

00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.160
and that passion is
fueling that dream, and.

00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.460
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's excellent.

00:58:26.460 --> 00:58:28.870
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: What the future
holds for us, we don't know,

00:58:28.870 --> 00:58:32.830
but we certainly are going
to put our energy and passion

00:58:32.830 --> 00:58:35.710
into working towards that dream.

00:58:35.710 --> 00:58:37.380
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's the way to do it.

00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.680
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:41.800
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: So, now
that the 25th is passed,

00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:46.030
what are your next
projects or performances?

00:58:46.030 --> 00:58:51.550
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah, well, we,
my board is now, finally, you know,

00:58:51.550 --> 00:58:54.000
coming back to the nitty
gritty as we, you know,

00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:59.320 position:56%
we recognize that we're a very small
dance company and we need to begin

00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:01.330
with have a business plan.

00:59:01.330 --> 00:59:07.330
We need to have and expanded and
more diverse board of directors

00:59:07.330 --> 00:59:10.900
and so we're working on very
practical things like that.

00:59:10.900 --> 00:59:12.830
More immediately, we've
got a business plan

00:59:12.830 --> 00:59:17.430
that we just put together, and
in fact, I've got a meeting

00:59:17.430 --> 00:59:20.770
in two days that's talking about
how do we expand the board.

00:59:20.770 --> 00:59:25.300
And, the board's trying to
help me to get to a stage

00:59:25.300 --> 00:59:30.270
where I can start affording to
pay at least three to four dancers

00:59:30.270 --> 00:59:32.620
so they're full-time with me.

00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:33.920 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Excellent, yeah.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:36.180
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And so, even
if we have a small core group,

00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:41.330
at least we have a core group that
can, that we can sustain, and then,

00:59:41.330 --> 00:59:47.120
we can then do so much more
with creating new work.

00:59:47.120 --> 00:59:52.660 position:56%
Because being such a small dance
company, I and the one or two others

00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:56.950
that are helping me do everything,
we do all the administrative work,

00:59:56.950 --> 01:00:01.310
all the marketing work, the
fundraising work, the logistics,

01:00:01.310 --> 01:00:04.730
the organization, the
teaching, and the creating.

01:00:04.730 --> 01:00:08.720
So, it limits us enormously,
and so even having three,

01:00:08.720 --> 01:00:13.540
four people would immediately
free our time up to do more.

01:00:13.540 --> 01:00:17.600
And, those are our immediate steps.

01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:19.300
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's wonderful.

01:00:19.300 --> 01:00:26.910
Thinking as an archivist, are you
preserving old video and recordings

01:00:26.910 --> 01:00:30.700
and so on of performances and?

01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:32.000
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:33.300
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
Because it's so valuable.

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:34.600
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: I know.

01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:36.140
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, it's a
huge, that's also a huge challenge

01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:39.510
because the media needs
to be digitized.

01:00:39.510 --> 01:00:40.810
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Digitized.

01:00:40.810 --> 01:00:42.110
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
And preserved and then.

01:00:42.110 --> 01:00:43.410
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:00:43.410 --> 01:00:50.200
So, unfortunately, you know, we
do have a lot of video footage

01:00:50.200 --> 01:00:55.590
of early performances in
the old VHS cassettes.

01:00:55.590 --> 01:01:01.750
Very poor quality, and I
have digitized them recently,

01:01:01.750 --> 01:01:06.090
in the last year, into
the DVD format, and.

01:01:06.090 --> 01:01:10.950
But, a lot of the resolution
is lost even in that process.

01:01:10.950 --> 01:01:13.690
I was told that was not
what I should have done.

01:01:13.690 --> 01:01:18.810
What I should have done is put it
on a wav format, but in any event,

01:01:18.810 --> 01:01:21.750
we've tried to save some
of the early video footage,

01:01:21.750 --> 01:01:25.000
but more recently, we're
doing better in terms

01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:28.000
of archiving our more recent work.

01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.740
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
It's very valuable.

01:01:29.740 --> 01:01:31.040
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.340
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Very important.

01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:33.640
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.940
I'm aware of that.

01:01:34.940 --> 01:01:36.240
I know.

01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:37.540
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: But,
it is also quite difficult.

01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:38.840
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah,
because it's all costs again.

01:01:38.840 --> 01:01:40.140
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:41.440
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah, yeah.

01:01:41.440 --> 01:01:42.740
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And,
it needs to be maintained.

01:01:42.740 --> 01:01:44.040
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And maintained.

01:01:44.040 --> 01:01:45.340
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Exactly.

01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:46.640
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.940
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

01:01:47.940 --> 01:01:49.240
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah,
so our hope is also to,

01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:55.060
to expand our programming
in the coming years.

01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:59.270
So far, we've been able to
just do one show a year,

01:01:59.270 --> 01:02:04.500
one big show a year, and we perform
a lot in the rest of the year.

01:02:04.500 --> 01:02:10.850 position:56%
But, mostly very small performances,
and we take part in local festivals

01:02:10.850 --> 01:02:14.620
and community based
organized events.

01:02:14.620 --> 01:02:20.430
We do get invited to participate
in other festivals in other cities.

01:02:20.430 --> 01:02:23.310
Sometimes in New York, like
the Erasing Borders Festival.

01:02:23.310 --> 01:02:25.510
So, we do those kinds
of performances,

01:02:25.510 --> 01:02:29.630
but Kalanidhi initiated programs
have typically been once a year.

01:02:29.630 --> 01:02:35.230
So, the board wants us to at least
expand that to two times a year

01:02:35.230 --> 01:02:41.240
to begin with because the minute it
is Kalanidhi initiated performance,

01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:45.600
it requires a huge amount of
investment in terms of money.

01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:54.470 position:56%
And, so that's another step
towards expanding programming that's

01:02:54.470 --> 01:02:56.360
in our control.

01:02:56.360 --> 01:03:00.360
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Do the
young dancers also perform?

01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.660
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, a lot.

01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.960
I mean, the young dancers.

01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.260
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: You want
to get them on the stage.

01:03:04.260 --> 01:03:05.560 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Perform the most.

01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:06.860
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Wonderful.

01:03:06.860 --> 01:03:08.650
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Because every
single community opportunity they

01:03:08.650 --> 01:03:10.160
get, they perform.

01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:15.070
So, we send them out because that's
how they become good dancers.

01:03:15.070 --> 01:03:16.370
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yes.

01:03:16.370 --> 01:03:17.670
Right.

01:03:17.670 --> 01:03:18.970
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, yeah.

01:03:18.970 --> 01:03:20.270
So, we have a huge emphasis.

01:03:20.270 --> 01:03:23.240
One of my dancers has now, who's
part of the staff, is now the,

01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:25.580
looks after the school
aspect of things.

01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:28.810
So, her main job is to
get those little kids

01:03:28.810 --> 01:03:32.680
out to every community based
performance opportunity possible.

01:03:32.680 --> 01:03:33.980
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Excellent.

01:03:33.980 --> 01:03:36.690
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And so, they
are just becoming experienced

01:03:36.690 --> 01:03:37.990
in performance.

01:03:37.990 --> 01:03:40.270
And so, when they're
join the company,

01:03:40.270 --> 01:03:42.320
they're already pretty
comfortable on stage.

01:03:42.320 --> 01:03:43.620
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
That's wonderful.

01:03:43.620 --> 01:03:44.920
I mean.

01:03:44.920 --> 01:03:46.220
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:03:46.220 --> 01:03:47.520
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: And, even
if they don't become dancers,

01:03:47.520 --> 01:03:48.820
that experience is invaluable.

01:03:48.820 --> 01:03:50.120
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: It's invaluable.

01:03:50.120 --> 01:03:51.480
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
Really, the confidence.

01:03:51.480 --> 01:03:52.780
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Exactly.

01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:58.300
It helps them in so many ways, and
I mean, the testimonials we have

01:03:58.300 --> 01:04:03.970
from students, parents,
returning students, alumni,

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:09.150
are really amazing what
dance does for them,

01:04:09.150 --> 01:04:13.070 position:56%
how deeply meaningful an experience.

01:04:13.070 --> 01:04:17.170
This whole 25th anniversary
performance was an incredible

01:04:17.170 --> 01:04:20.650
experience because so many
of our alumni came back

01:04:20.650 --> 01:04:23.410
from different parts of the
country to be a part of it,

01:04:23.410 --> 01:04:26.540
and they've been flying back every
weekend in the month of October.

01:04:26.540 --> 01:04:27.840
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Really?

01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:29.140
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Just so they
could do the group rehearsals

01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:35.930
in order to perform, and it was a
very sentimental, nostalgic feeling

01:04:35.930 --> 01:04:41.150 position:56%
after the show because they all were
in tears saying, "Thank you so much

01:04:41.150 --> 01:04:44.140
for including us, for
thinking of inviting us.

01:04:44.140 --> 01:04:48.970
It's just reminding us all over
again how special it is to be

01:04:48.970 --> 01:04:51.700
with other fellow dancers
and dance on stage."

01:04:51.700 --> 01:04:56.290
And so, it's heartwarming
at many levels.

01:04:56.290 --> 01:04:57.590
Yeah.

01:04:57.590 --> 01:04:59.890
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Wonderful.

01:05:07.050 --> 01:05:08.350
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah, it.

01:05:08.350 --> 01:05:09.720
Yeah. Is there something
that you'd like to cover

01:05:09.720 --> 01:05:12.260
that I hadn't asked about?

01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:20.650
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Or teachers, or
poetry, or work with [inaudible].

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:26.410
Or, you've done some
interesting work

01:05:26.410 --> 01:05:34.740 position:56%
with different composers [inaudible]
and had pieces commissioned.

01:05:34.740 --> 01:05:36.980
Do you do a lot of that?

01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:40.440
What do you tell a
composer when you're asking

01:05:40.440 --> 01:05:43.940
for something to be
composed for you?

01:05:43.940 --> 01:05:47.560
You choreograph after
the piece is composed?

01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:48.860
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes, yes.

01:05:48.860 --> 01:05:50.160
&gt;&gt; So, what do you?

01:05:50.160 --> 01:05:53.900
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: After it's
composed but before it's recorded.

01:05:53.900 --> 01:06:00.700
So, typically, what happens
is it starts with a concept.

01:06:00.700 --> 01:06:04.860
It starts with a concept,
and sometimes,

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:13.260
the concept requires lyrics,
so then poetry is written

01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:16.280
to which revolves around
that concept.

01:06:16.280 --> 01:06:23.020
And, then, and then, I think at
that's the stage where I roughly,

01:06:23.020 --> 01:06:28.160
I have a rough sketch of how
I visualize each of the scenes

01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:30.030
or each of those concepts.

01:06:30.030 --> 01:06:35.760
And so, I write out the notes
for each of those concepts,

01:06:35.760 --> 01:06:39.040
and that is what I take
to the music composer.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.470
And, if there are lyrics,
I give him the lyrics.

01:06:42.470 --> 01:06:45.580
And, if it's just a
concept, an abstract concept,

01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:51.230
I give him the notes
around that concept.

01:06:51.230 --> 01:06:56.100
And, he creates the music, and
it's usually just the raw score,

01:06:56.100 --> 01:06:59.050
and the raw score is
like a piano track.

01:06:59.050 --> 01:07:02.700
It's, if it's a flutist, if the
music composer is a flutist,

01:07:02.700 --> 01:07:06.900
then he would create the
raw score on a flute.

01:07:06.900 --> 01:07:12.720
And, this last, last composer
was a singer, so he just sang.

01:07:12.720 --> 01:07:20.070
His voice was the raw score,
and based off of that raw score,

01:07:20.070 --> 01:07:25.700
we choreograph the whole work.

01:07:25.700 --> 01:07:30.300
And then, I videotape that
work and I take it with me

01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.540
for the final recording
because the final recording has

01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:38.780
to be exactly fitting
the choreography.

01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:40.900
And so, it's quite
a tedious process.

01:07:40.900 --> 01:07:43.050
It's quite an expensive process.

01:07:43.050 --> 01:07:49.180
So, it's not easy to do new
work every, very often because,

01:07:49.180 --> 01:07:50.680
first of all, it takes
a lot of time.

01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:54.770
Secondly, it's very
expensive to do it.

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:57.090
And, it's much easier
to take music off

01:07:57.090 --> 01:08:00.670
of the net and choreograph to it.

01:08:00.670 --> 01:08:04.120 position:56%
And, that's possible for
individual pieces, but when you want

01:08:04.120 --> 01:08:06.980
to put a whole thematic
work together,

01:08:06.980 --> 01:08:09.190
this is the best way to do it.

01:08:09.190 --> 01:08:14.420
And, that's why when, when
collaborators like Ryan Brown come,

01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.920
it's such a luxury for us because
we don't have to worry about,

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:22.880
it's like handed to us, the music

01:08:22.880 --> 01:08:25.830
and the background notes,
the concept is handed.

01:08:25.830 --> 01:08:31.460
And then, it's just a question
of choreographing to the music.

01:08:32.880 --> 01:08:36.990
Yeah. And, Ryan has approached
us for yet another collaboration

01:08:36.990 --> 01:08:41.420
which we're exploring
and to present in 2018,

01:08:41.420 --> 01:08:45.580
and this is the first time
it's going to be a work

01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:47.540
which has no opera singers.

01:08:47.540 --> 01:08:51.950
So, it's going to be his
orchestra playing to our dancers.

01:08:51.950 --> 01:08:54.800
So, I'm really excited about it.

01:08:54.800 --> 01:09:00.570
Yeah. So, this is like having an
entire western orchestra playing

01:09:00.570 --> 01:09:02.040
for Kuchipudi dancers.

01:09:02.040 --> 01:09:04.290
It's an amazing opportunity.

01:09:04.290 --> 01:09:06.750
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Which genre
are they, is he going towards?

01:09:06.750 --> 01:09:10.350
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: He's going
to send me the detailed notes.

01:09:10.350 --> 01:09:11.650
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

01:09:11.650 --> 01:09:12.950
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Next week.

01:09:12.950 --> 01:09:14.250
He was waiting for my November
6th show to be finished.

01:09:14.250 --> 01:09:17.630
It's called "The Enchanted Forest".

01:09:17.630 --> 01:09:19.510
Are you familiar with it?

01:09:19.510 --> 01:09:22.770
I have to, I have to read about
it and learn more about it.

01:09:22.770 --> 01:09:24.500
I know very little right now.

01:09:24.500 --> 01:09:25.800
It's a short work.

01:09:25.800 --> 01:09:32.660
It's like a 30 minute work, but
it's just the idea is exciting.

01:09:32.660 --> 01:09:42.610
But, I must, I'd like to
say that I owe a huge, huge,

01:09:42.610 --> 01:09:47.690
huge debt to my guru, my teacher
Guru Vempati Chinna Satyam

01:09:47.690 --> 01:09:58.620 position:56%
for giving so generously his
knowledge and for being a role model

01:09:58.620 --> 01:10:05.210
for the passion that
he had for the art form

01:10:05.210 --> 01:10:14.310
and the way he spent his
time where dance and music

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:17.500
and the art superseded
everything else for him.

01:10:17.500 --> 01:10:24.550
So, it was, it's, to walk in
his footsteps is truly an honor

01:10:24.550 --> 01:10:29.580
for students of his, and
I'm always ever grateful

01:10:29.580 --> 01:10:32.020
for being one of his students.

01:10:32.020 --> 01:10:38.690
And, I think, I consider myself
lucky to have been his student,

01:10:38.690 --> 01:10:40.290
and I don't think I
would have been able

01:10:40.290 --> 01:10:44.390
to do what I've done
without his guidance.

01:10:44.390 --> 01:10:48.520
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: I love the
combination of your passion

01:10:48.520 --> 01:10:51.330
for the tradition and your
passion for innovation

01:10:51.330 --> 01:10:59.790
at the same time it sounds like
it's both, both are his legacies.

01:10:59.790 --> 01:11:01.090
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yes.

01:11:01.090 --> 01:11:04.630
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: And, I loved,
I mean, when you were talking

01:11:04.630 --> 01:11:10.720
about the Rameau project
with Ryan, I just loved,

01:11:10.720 --> 01:11:16.610
among the other things,
the minuets that were done

01:11:16.610 --> 01:11:21.590
with both the baroque figures and
Kuchipudi figures at the same time

01:11:21.590 --> 01:11:25.380
and how they beautifully
they work together.

01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.680
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I know.

01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:27.980
Amazing.

01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.880
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: And, that's
where I credit Ryan Brown

01:11:29.880 --> 01:11:37.990
to even have a vision where he saw
these three incredibly different

01:11:37.990 --> 01:11:41.360
dance forms coming together.

01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.030
I mean, and to be able to
take that step to invite three

01:11:46.030 --> 01:11:52.390
such diverse groups together and
to have them work with each other.

01:11:52.390 --> 01:11:57.740
Just to take that step itself
requires a man with a vision

01:11:57.740 --> 01:12:03.630
and so we were all, you know,
didn't know what to make of it,

01:12:03.630 --> 01:12:05.640
but we were excited
by the opportunity.

01:12:05.640 --> 01:12:10.720
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: You know,
it's interesting to me

01:12:12.090 --> 01:12:20.500
that [inaudible] have absolute
commitment to your art form

01:12:20.500 --> 01:12:26.220
and to the idea of
trying [inaudible]

01:12:26.220 --> 01:12:33.630
because sometimes will love an
art form but feel like they have

01:12:33.630 --> 01:12:37.850
to change it in order to make
it acceptable to somebody else.

01:12:37.850 --> 01:12:42.120
But, the feeling that I
get from both of you is

01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:46.280
that not only is it a complete
commitment to the art forms

01:12:46.280 --> 01:12:51.010
that you have, but they will stand
on their own and are strong enough

01:12:51.010 --> 01:12:55.780
to come forward and integrate
with other kinds of art forms

01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.390
that people will come to them,
you know, come to the art.

01:13:01.390 --> 01:13:02.690
You don't have to.

01:13:02.690 --> 01:13:03.990
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Yeah.

01:13:03.990 --> 01:13:05.290
You've articulated
it so beautifully.

01:13:05.290 --> 01:13:06.590
That's.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:07.890
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: I think.

01:13:07.890 --> 01:13:09.190
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: So true.

01:13:09.190 --> 01:13:10.490
That's absolutely true.

01:13:10.490 --> 01:13:14.810
It is, and that is the real
crux of, I think, what we do,

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:17.200
you know, and what we believe in.

01:13:17.200 --> 01:13:20.610
And, that is the real
challenge also.

01:13:20.610 --> 01:13:24.720
How do you stay true to the art
form because it is so beautiful,

01:13:24.720 --> 01:13:28.020
it has so much depth
and complexity and

01:13:28.020 --> 01:13:31.000
yet make it relevant
to your audience?

01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:35.540
And, that's where the innovation
has to come into play to be able

01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:37.970
to bring it to your audience.

01:13:44.080 --> 01:13:45.710 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: You did a great job.

01:13:45.710 --> 01:13:47.010
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Thank you.

01:13:47.010 --> 01:13:48.310
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Yeah.

01:13:48.310 --> 01:13:49.610
Wonderful.

01:13:49.610 --> 01:13:50.910
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Thank you.

01:13:50.910 --> 01:13:54.210
&gt;&gt; Thea Austen: Is there anything
else you would like to talk about?

01:13:54.210 --> 01:13:55.510
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Wow.

01:13:55.510 --> 01:14:03.040
You know, maybe I could speak
to what dance means to me.

01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:08.090
You know, ultimately, I do feel,

01:14:08.090 --> 01:14:11.230
because I'm an Indian classical
dance practitioner, for me,

01:14:11.230 --> 01:14:17.120
dance is very, it's very much
part of the spiritual journey

01:14:17.120 --> 01:14:22.020
that I am going through as
an individual as I live life.

01:14:22.020 --> 01:14:29.070
And, I feel the practice
evolves as I mature, the dance,

01:14:29.070 --> 01:14:35.810
the dance evolves with me,
the, and I feel that all of us

01:14:35.810 --> 01:14:39.040
in our lives are searching for
something that's greater than us,

01:14:39.040 --> 01:14:43.590
that's bigger than ourselves.

01:14:43.590 --> 01:14:48.880
And, to me, dance provides that.

01:14:48.880 --> 01:14:52.440
Dance provides that
vehicle to search

01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:57.130
for something that's
bigger than oneself.

01:14:57.130 --> 01:14:58.430
It could be a goal.

01:14:58.430 --> 01:15:03.290
It could be the search for
beauty, search for the truth,

01:15:03.290 --> 01:15:10.740
search for happiness, search for
love, and I am eternally grateful

01:15:10.740 --> 01:15:15.680
that I've been given this
vehicle which is Kuchipudi

01:15:15.680 --> 01:15:21.930
and Indian classical
dance that helps me evolve

01:15:21.930 --> 01:15:27.500
as a person using the art form.

01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:30.580
And, for that, I'm
eternally grateful.

01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:33.590
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst: Well,
Anuradha, this has been delightful

01:15:33.590 --> 01:15:39.350
and very meaningful to talk
to you about your dancers,

01:15:39.350 --> 01:15:43.110
about your dance, your concept
of the dance, the history.

01:15:43.110 --> 01:15:51.060
Fascinating, and it
all, it's an amazing,

01:15:51.060 --> 01:15:54.890
it's an amazing life you've
lived and continue to live

01:15:54.890 --> 01:15:58.530
with the innovation
of bringing tradition,

01:15:58.530 --> 01:16:02.210
making it accessible
to new audiences.

01:16:02.210 --> 01:16:03.510
Very exciting.

01:16:03.510 --> 01:16:04.810
So, thank you so much.

01:16:04.810 --> 01:16:06.110
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: No, thank you.

01:16:06.110 --> 01:16:07.930
&gt;&gt; Catherine Kerst:
Really appreciate.

01:16:07.930 --> 01:16:09.900
Really enjoyed talking to you.

01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:13.180
&gt;&gt; Anuradha Nehru: Thank you so
much for giving me this opportunity

01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:21.980
to talk about Kuchipudi and to
bring it to a larger audience.

01:16:21.980 --> 01:16:25.290
Thank you so much.

01:16:25.290 --> 01:16:29.180

of the Library of Congress.
