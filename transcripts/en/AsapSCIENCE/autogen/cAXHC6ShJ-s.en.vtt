example 40 spins around the Sun and it's
 

00:00:58.649 --> 00:00:59.990
example 40 spins around the Sun and it's
about time you should be getting checked

00:00:59.990 --> 00:01:00.000
about time you should be getting checked
 

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.090

don't uh so today we thought we would

00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:10.350
don't uh so today we thought we would
 

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.870
don't uh so today we thought we would
age ourselves with some interesting

00:01:11.870 --> 00:01:11.880
age ourselves with some interesting
 

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.760
age ourselves with some interesting
software now there are a lot of other

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:13.770
software now there are a lot of other
 

00:01:13.770 --> 00:01:15.980
software now there are a lot of other
apps and stuff out there that can aid

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:15.990
apps and stuff out there that can aid
 

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.969
apps and stuff out there that can aid
you but what we're gonna use is

00:01:16.969 --> 00:01:16.979
you but what we're gonna use is
 

00:01:16.979 --> 00:01:19.310

image launcher oh you did it we had

00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:21.630
image launcher oh you did it we had

trouble remembering that a genome huh so

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:25.530
trouble remembering that a genome huh so
 

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:27.200
trouble remembering that a genome huh so
essentially these are landmarks that

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:27.210
essentially these are landmarks that
 

00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:29.240
essentially these are landmarks that
will take this template face on the left

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:29.250
will take this template face on the left
 

00:01:29.250 --> 00:01:31.370
will take this template face on the left
and put it over Mitch's face to age it

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
and put it over Mitch's face to age it
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:38.149
and put it over Mitch's face to age it
most accurate yeah I don't have the best

00:01:38.149 --> 00:01:38.159

future to look forward to so it's
 

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.630
future to look forward to so it's

sort of makes sense because if you have
darker skin or black skin you have sort

00:01:47.030 --> 00:01:47.040
darker skin or black skin you have sort
 

00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:48.800
darker skin or black skin you have sort
