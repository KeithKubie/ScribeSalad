00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.250
How the 20/20 Vision Scale Works

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.680
With more than 150 million people in the United
States (nearly half of the population) requiring

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:15.269
some form of corrective eyewear to compensate
for visual impairment, chances are you have

00:00:15.269 --> 00:00:18.660
had your eyesight graded on the 20/20 scale
before.

00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:22.710
If you haven’t, you have probably heard
other people saying they have “20/20 vision”

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:25.699
or even the phrase “hindsight is 20/20.”

00:00:25.699 --> 00:00:29.720
The vision scale is so prevalent in American
culture that there’s even a TV news show

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:31.090
named after it.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:35.320
Of course, if you’re from, for example,
Australia, you might be told you have 6/6

00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:36.320
vision.

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.809
Turns out, the 20/20 scale isn’t universal.

00:00:38.809 --> 00:00:43.620
So what exactly are eye doctors measuring,
and how can the scale be different in different

00:00:43.620 --> 00:00:45.010
parts of the world?

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:49.690
After examining a large number of people,
American ophthalmologists decided on the 20/20

00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:54.850
scale, saying that “20/20” is the normal
visual acuity of the average person.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:58.880
What that means is that standing 20 feet away
from something, you can see what the average

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.610
person can see standing 20 feet away from
the same thing.

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:06.290
Take the Snellen eye chart, which is what
your eye doctor will usually use to judge

00:01:06.290 --> 00:01:07.290
your eyesight.

00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:11.289
The Snellen chart is the one that’s topped
with the big E and consists of 11 rows of

00:01:11.289 --> 00:01:15.389
capital letters that get progressively smaller
toward the bottom of the chart.

00:01:15.389 --> 00:01:19.259
You will be placed 20 feet away from the chart
(most doctors’ offices are too small for

00:01:19.259 --> 00:01:22.609
this, so mirrors will often be used to simulate
20 feet).

00:01:22.609 --> 00:01:26.639
The doctor will ask you to read out the smallest
line of letters that you can see from 20 feet

00:01:26.639 --> 00:01:27.639
away.

00:01:27.639 --> 00:01:31.170
Most people can read the fourth line up from
the bottom without any trouble, so if you

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.789
can do this, your vision is considered 20/20.

00:01:33.789 --> 00:01:38.799
Now, obviously most places in the world don’t
use the Imperial system to measure distance,

00:01:38.799 --> 00:01:43.029
they use the Metric system, which is where
the 6/6 scale comes in.

00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:47.430
In this case, doctors are not measuring how
well you can see something from 20 feet away,

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:53.279
they are measuring how well you can see at
6 meters away (that is, 19.69 feet approximately).

00:01:53.279 --> 00:01:56.799
It’s the same principle, just a slightly
different measurement.

00:01:56.799 --> 00:02:01.279
Of course, many people will have worse or
even better than 20/20 vision.

00:02:01.279 --> 00:02:03.439
These people will tip the scales a bit.

00:02:03.439 --> 00:02:07.630
Back to the Snellen chart, if you can only
see the big E up top and none of the other

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.430
lines of text, you are considered to have
20/200 vision.

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:16.470
That means you see at 20 feet what the average
person can see at 200 feet away.

00:02:16.470 --> 00:02:21.950
20/200 visual acuity and worse is considered
legally blind in the United States.

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.750
Alternatively, if you can read the tiny bottom
line of text on the chart at 20 feet away,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:31.599
you have 20/5 visual acuity, which means you
can see at 20 feet that which most people

00:02:31.599 --> 00:02:33.260
can only see at 5 feet away.

00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:38.490
Most humans don’t have the ability to have
much better than 20/10 vision, with 20/5 vision

00:02:38.490 --> 00:02:41.030
reserved for animals like birds of prey.

00:02:41.030 --> 00:02:44.040
These numbers would obviously be adjusted
for the 6/6 scale.

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:49.770
That said, your 20/20 or 6/6 visual acuity
is not a measure of your prescription as it

00:02:49.770 --> 00:02:53.700
does not take into account the nature of the
problem, only the result of it.

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.659
That’s why you can’t just pop in to your
ophthalmologist, read the Snellen chart, and

00:02:57.659 --> 00:03:02.180
head out—they have to measure things like
peripheral vision, colour perception, depth

00:03:02.180 --> 00:03:05.620
perception, and eye fluid pressure, among
other things.

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:08.980
Bonus Fact:
• The Snellen eye chart was created by Herman

00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:11.579
Snellen, a Dutch eye doctor, in the 1860s.

00:03:11.579 --> 00:03:16.700
There have been other charts developed, however,
which also might be used during an eye exam.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:22.440
An example is the Tumbling E chart which features
capital letter E’s facing in different directions.

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:26.670
This chart comes in handy when young children
who don’t know the alphabet are being tested,

00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.280
or for people who don’t know the English
alphabet.

00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.379
Rather than say a letter, they can pick the
smallest line of E’s that they can see,

00:03:33.379 --> 00:03:37.920
and say or point which way the “arms”
of the E in that line are facing.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:41.730
Numerous studies have shown that this chart
and the Snellen chart come up with nearly

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:55.870
the same results.
