Hello, I'm Daven Hiskey, you're watching the
TodayIFoundOut YouTube channel.

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:10.440
In the video today, we're looking at what
exactly the uvula does for you.

00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.900
Hanging from the back edge of your soft palate,
the palatine uvula seems to serve several

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:18.320
functions, none of which are particularly
necessary for most people, which is why it

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.890
can generally be removed with few, if any,
noticeable side effects.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:25.950
In fact, in the West, the "uvula" (name deriving
from the Latin "uvola," meaning "small bunch

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:31.960
of grapes") is often cut out as part of uvulopalatopharyngoplasty
to help patients who suffer from sleep apnea.

00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:34.149
Other cultures have long removed the uvula,
sometimes as part of a ritual, to treat all

00:00:34.149 --> 00:00:37.600
manner of "throat conditions," as well as
cure everything from vomiting and diarrhea

00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.720
to rejecting breast feeding, growth retardation
and even anorexia.

00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:46.420
Today the surgery is still occasionally practiced
among various ethnic groups in Eritrea, Ethiopia,

00:00:46.420 --> 00:00:49.960
Kenya, Niger, Nigeria, Sierra Leone and Zarma.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:53.190
So if you probably wouldn't notice anything
particularly different when it's removed,

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.920
what does the uvula actually do and why do
we still have one?

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.210
Beyond that it is necessary for producing
important sounds, sometimes called uvular

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:04.440
consonants, in several languages, including
French and Arabic, perhaps the most noticeable

00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:07.549
role of the uvula is helping to keep the throat
moist.

00:01:07.549 --> 00:01:10.890
You see, the uvula is packed with serous and
seromucous glands.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.800
When muscle fibers in the uvula contract,
it results in these glands excreting significant

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:18.600
amounts of a thin form of saliva that gets
splattered and dripped around the throat as

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.310
we speak and swallow.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:24.060
In fact, one of the potential side effects
of having your uvula removed is occasional

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.920
problems with a dry throat.

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:29.840
With the help of its internal muscular fibers,
the uvula also aids the soft palate in sealing

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:33.530
off the passageway between your throat and
your nose (called the nasopharynx) when you

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:37.340
swallow and speak, helping to make sure bits
of food or liquid don't go up your nose and

00:01:37.340 --> 00:01:41.520
that the air and vocal vibrations are directed
out of your mouth and not your nasal cavity.

00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:45.200
The partial role the uvula has in this has
led some to speculate that it assists with

00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:49.590
keeping the tone of our voices in a pleasing
range, as it could help control both resonance

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.850
and subdue the nasal tone of the voice.

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.270
However, the soft palate alone is usually
perfectly capable of sealing the nasopharynx,

00:01:56.270 --> 00:02:01.659
and thus, in most cases the uvula is not necessary
to put an end to a nasally sounding voice.

00:02:01.659 --> 00:02:05.840
In rare cases, some individuals do have a
problem with this, a condition called velopharyngeal

00:02:05.840 --> 00:02:10.299
insufficiency, which, beyond potential issues
like nasal regurgitation (bits of food and

00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:14.230
the like going up your nose when swallowing),
results in the individual having difficulty

00:02:14.230 --> 00:02:15.989
saying consonants like "b".

00:02:15.989 --> 00:02:19.609
Given these primary functions of the uvula,
it has been proposed that the reason humans

00:02:19.609 --> 00:02:24.439
have a uvula is because it aids somewhat in
speech, making it an accessory speech organ.

00:02:24.439 --> 00:02:28.849
This theory is loosely supported by the fact
that, outside of humans, only a few animals,

00:02:28.849 --> 00:02:33.079
and this is individual animals, not species,
have been found to even have one.

00:02:33.079 --> 00:02:36.829
Another function of the uvula relates to its
role in the gag reflex, as it is one of only

00:02:36.829 --> 00:02:40.530
five parts of the body that will potentially
trigger it (the others being the roof of the

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.439
mouth, the backs of the tongue and throat,
and the tonsils).

00:02:43.439 --> 00:02:47.099
Having something the dangles down over the
throat opening that can trigger this is obviously

00:02:47.099 --> 00:02:50.549
beneficial over just the tissue around said
opening performing this function.

00:02:50.549 --> 00:02:54.519
However, as with the other stuff the uvula
does for you, it isn't really necessary in

00:02:54.519 --> 00:02:58.650
this case either and, for most people, its
removal would not likely inconvenience them

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:03.230
in the slightest, or even necessarily be noticed
at all other than potentially visually.
