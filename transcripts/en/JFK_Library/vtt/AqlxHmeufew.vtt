00:00:00.253 --> 00:00:01.925
- [Interviewer] There have been
times that you've been told

00:00:01.925 --> 00:00:04.268
that you don't have a
ballet dancer's body.

00:00:04.268 --> 00:00:06.702
- Mmhmm.
- Is that true?

00:00:06.702 --> 00:00:10.869
- I mean, to this day I
still hear it. (laughs)

00:00:14.753 --> 00:00:16.420
It scarred me.

00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:18.503
It's made me hate myself.

00:00:21.541 --> 00:00:26.440
There have been so many levels
of feelings and transitions

00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:30.191
of being on your own at 17
years old in New York City,

00:00:30.191 --> 00:00:33.104
and trying to figure out
who you are as a person,

00:00:33.104 --> 00:00:37.271
and fit into this world, and
being told that, you know,

00:00:38.514 --> 00:00:40.666
it took me a long time to understand

00:00:40.666 --> 00:00:43.463
what these people were saying.

00:00:43.463 --> 00:00:44.462
- [Interviewer] What were they saying?

00:00:44.462 --> 00:00:47.352
- That you have brown
skin and you don't belong,

00:00:47.352 --> 00:00:49.880
and that's why you don't
have the right body,

00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:53.072
because I know that I have a similar body

00:00:53.072 --> 00:00:54.989
to a lot of professional dancers.

00:00:54.989 --> 00:00:59.387
And to this day, professional
dancers are much more athletic

00:00:59.387 --> 00:01:01.311
than they used to be.

00:01:01.311 --> 00:01:03.875
And they have busts and they have hips.

00:01:03.875 --> 00:01:07.477
And if those dancers are
white, they're not criticized

00:01:07.477 --> 00:01:09.090
for the same thing.

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:13.875
And so, it took me some time
to accept and realize that,

00:01:13.875 --> 00:01:16.625
and try and decipher those words.

00:01:17.749 --> 00:01:20.277
But yeah, to this day I can go on a blog,

00:01:20.277 --> 00:01:24.444
and read that I have the most
hideous body and I'm fat.

00:01:25.718 --> 00:01:28.571
(laughs)
(audience laughs)

00:01:28.571 --> 00:01:32.382
So you know, it's about
understanding people's intentions,

00:01:32.382 --> 00:01:36.049
not reading those things,
and just you know,

00:01:37.994 --> 00:01:39.928
trusting in yourself and doing the work,

00:01:39.928 --> 00:01:41.234
and being your healthiest self,

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:42.992
and that was a big part
of creating this book,

00:01:42.992 --> 00:01:47.336
Ballerina Body, was that
it's not about transforming

00:01:47.336 --> 00:01:49.860
and making yourself
look like someone else,

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.459
or look like Gelsey
Kirkland or Sylvie Guillem.

00:01:53.459 --> 00:01:56.131
It's not about that, it's about
being your healthiest self,

00:01:56.131 --> 00:01:59.941
and making your body
the best that it can be.

00:01:59.941 --> 00:02:02.424
And that's what I've learned
throughout my journey

00:02:02.424 --> 00:02:04.507
as a professional dancer.
