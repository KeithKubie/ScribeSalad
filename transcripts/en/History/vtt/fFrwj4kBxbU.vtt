SHELBY: Willie!

00:00:01.380 --> 00:00:02.380
Hey!

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:03.330
What's going on?
STEVE ROREX: Hey, man.

00:00:03.330 --> 00:00:04.500
DAN FEARS: What are you doing?

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.580
I was trying to catch
a fish, but my rod broke.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:09.170
What y'all up to, huh?

00:00:09.170 --> 00:00:11.880
Shelby had been downriver
for a couple of years now.

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:12.830
We heard he's back.

00:00:12.830 --> 00:00:14.830
It's really exciting
for us, 'cause

00:00:14.830 --> 00:00:18.880
we're in such desperate need
of some good wood right now.

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.210
We heard you been downriver
We've been looking for you.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.170
SHELBY: Shut up, [inaudible]!

00:00:23.170 --> 00:00:24.960
We're from Southern Wood.

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:28.170
We got a shop down the
road, not too far from here.

00:00:28.170 --> 00:00:29.120
You got any logs?

00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:30.210
SHELBY: Yeah, I got a few, man.

00:00:30.210 --> 00:00:31.250
I got some right there.

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:32.380
I got two.

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:34.710
Yeah, we-- we need
a few more than that.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.040
DAN FEARS: Big.

00:00:36.040 --> 00:00:38.330
We've got a huge oar we've
been trying to get field--

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:40.620
SHELBY: [blows nose]

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:41.710
STEVE ROREX: And
we've been going

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.670
through several
different log guys,

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.830
and nobody can do
what we need to do.

00:00:45.830 --> 00:00:47.500
Well, how much is it?

00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:50.210
STEVE ROREX: We, uh, we
need to get at least 10,000

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:51.580
board feet of sinker cypress.

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:55.210
Is that something
you think you can do?

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:57.920
[laughs]
DAN FEARS: We got--

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.210
Well, how much
money y'all got down?

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.380
You can put any
money down on it?

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.790
Well, we'd give
you a big deposit.

00:01:01.790 --> 00:01:03.170
Well, let me have it.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:06.420
Well, we need to
see some logs first.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.580
How soon do you need it?

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:09.250
How soon can you get it?

00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:10.790
Well, hell, I
ain't psychic yet.

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:12.080
Now as soon as I
get it, I get it.

00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.250
DAN FEARS: All right, man.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:14.250
I mean, I'll get it as
fast as I can get it, man.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.250
I mean--
- We in a tight rush, you know.

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.420
We got to get this
thing processed.

00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:18.620
[bleep] right, man.

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.750
Ho, we needing it bad.

00:01:20.750 --> 00:01:22.250
What's your name again?
- Steve.

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:24.250
SHELBY: [bleep] Oh, man.

00:01:24.250 --> 00:01:25.750
That sounds good, man.
STEVE ROREX: Good.

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:26.670
DAN FEARS: Pretty exciting.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.250
One big-ass damn order, man.

00:01:28.250 --> 00:01:30.210
What the [bleep] I
got myself into now?

00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.080
Here we go, Junior!

00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.120
NARRATOR: So today,
he's thinking big.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:37.580
I've got a pretty
good idea where I might

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.750
find a bunch of good logs.

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.080
NARRATOR: Heading
to a bend downriver,

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:45.620
hunting for a log
raft rumored to have

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:49.460
sunk over 100 years ago.
- Right there.

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:50.040
Dead ahead.

00:01:57.460 --> 00:01:58.330
What is that?

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:04.290
Oh, that's cable
from the big log.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.920
That's the raft!

00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.790
Ah-ho, there he is.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:11.790
It was there.

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:14.210
DONNA: Is that a
piece of the raft?

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:16.420
SHELBY: That's the raft.

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:19.620
My boy.

00:02:19.620 --> 00:02:22.460
NARRATOR: Now there's an old
saying, where there's smoke,

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.080
there's fire.

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.250
And right about now--

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.460
SHELBY: So damn
close I can feel it.

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.670
NARRATOR: --Shelby's
getting hot.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:33.830
I think I might have found
some damn sunken treasure.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:34.960
Come on, Junior!

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:44.460
DONNA: That must be
a log right there.

00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:45.960
Yeah.

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:46.830
See it bubbling?

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:53.380
There it is!

00:02:53.380 --> 00:02:55.880
Ha, ha, ha!

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.330
Got that done.

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.880
Boy, it's a good one, Papaw!

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.000
That's a good
one, right there.

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:04.580
Yee-haw!

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.710
We on top of it now, Junior!

00:03:09.710 --> 00:03:12.500
It's only one log, but
it's a damn good start.

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.750
Let's see the rest
of that raft, Papaw.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.710
Oh, here we go!

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:21.330
Dig it downwards, baby!

00:03:21.330 --> 00:03:22.290
Oh!

00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:26.710
Plenty more where that came.

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:28.170
DONNA: Woo, it's raining logs!

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:29.170
Woo!

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:32.290
Ah ho, we got 'em,
getting them now.

00:03:32.290 --> 00:03:34.830
DONNA: This a gold
mine right here, man.

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.040
I knew this damn raft
was down here, man.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.500
There's a whole
bunch of them here.

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.880
Get it go gone now, Junior, with
all the damn logs we got now.

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.710
How'd you like that, Papaw!

00:03:45.710 --> 00:03:47.620
Oh, my gosh.

00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:49.620
NARRATOR: After two
years on the sidelines,

00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:53.380
Shelby came back with empty
pockets and a determination

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.120
to fill them.

00:03:56.120 --> 00:03:59.420
And using every trick he
knows, the swamp man's

00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:04.250
hustling his way right
back onto the gravy train.

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:06.250
My mama didn't raise no
fool, and my daddy didn't

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:07.880
raise no idiot, so here we go.

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:14.170
NARRATOR: But Shelby ain't
just helping himself.

00:04:14.170 --> 00:04:16.920
STEVE ROREX: Shelby!

00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:17.750
What y'all doing?

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:19.120
You been working on our order?

00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:20.460
Yeah.

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:23.170
I been getting here's some
logs right here I got for it.

00:04:23.170 --> 00:04:24.920
Look at them big ones.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:26.420
DAN FEARS: That's nice.

00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.290
NARRATOR: Thanks to the swamp
man, the boys at Southern Wood

00:04:29.290 --> 00:04:31.540
could be on to the big time.

00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:33.670
These logs are
looking great so far.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.380
Primo logs, great logs.

00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.170
I just want to make sure
you're good with this,

00:04:37.170 --> 00:04:38.120
and you got everything.

00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:38.830
SHELBY: Damn right.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.920
I got it, man.

00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:41.790
This is just hopefully
the first of many.

00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.330
You know, if everything is this
good or better moving forward--

00:04:44.330 --> 00:04:45.960
We're going to be in
a, we'll be sitting high.

00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:47.790
--Shelby's going to hit
one out the park for us.

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:49.380
Yeah.
SHELBY: Thank y'all, Steve, Dan.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.120
See y'all.

00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:55.120
Ho, here we go, and oh my
god, we gonna be good now.
