reduce their apk size by 30%

00:09:38.800 --> 00:09:38.810
reduce their apk size by 30%
 

00:09:38.810 --> 00:09:42.190
reduce their apk size by 30%
this in turn helped them increase their

00:09:42.190 --> 00:09:42.200
this in turn helped them increase their
 

00:09:42.200 --> 00:09:46.329
this in turn helped them increase their
conversions by 6 percent and the best

00:09:46.329 --> 00:09:46.339
conversions by 6 percent and the best
 

00:09:46.339 --> 00:09:48.250
conversions by 6 percent and the best
part of it is that they didn't have to

00:09:48.250 --> 00:09:48.260
part of it is that they didn't have to
 

00:09:48.260 --> 00:09:50.410
part of it is that they didn't have to
change a single line of code to achieve

together in the initial install this can

only reduce the initial install size but

00:10:15.430 --> 00:10:15.440
only reduce the initial install size but
 

00:10:15.440 --> 00:10:17.710
only reduce the initial install size but
also the space that you actually take on
