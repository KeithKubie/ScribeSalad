is it's not horrible I dare even say

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:50.530 align:start position:0%
it's not even really that bad I think
 

00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:52.740 align:start position:0%
it's not even really that bad I think
getting<00:06:50.860><c> to</c><00:06:50.950><c> the</c><00:06:51.160><c> third</c><00:06:51.190><c> is</c><00:06:51.700><c> worth</c><00:06:52.270><c> it</c><00:06:52.570><c> it's</c>

getting to the third is worth it it's
