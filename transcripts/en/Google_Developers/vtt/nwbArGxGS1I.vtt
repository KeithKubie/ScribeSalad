00:00:08.581 --> 00:00:10.830
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Hello, and
welcome to public speaking

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:14.300
pro-tips with Speechless,
presented by Google Developers.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.134
We help people turn the
mundane into the memorable.

00:00:17.134 --> 00:00:18.800
ARJITA SETHI: Challenges
into insights--

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.300
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
--and presentations

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:21.130
into performances.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:23.540
ARJITA SETHI: Today, you
do that with something we

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.300
call taking agency,
giving yourself

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.776
permission to do what you need
to make yourself comfortable.

00:00:29.776 --> 00:00:31.650
CLAIRE SLATTERY: We'll
give you our top three

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:34.530
tips on how to empower
yourself before, during,

00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:36.920
and after your meeting,
video, or talk.

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:39.790
ARJITA SETHI: Let's jump right
in with my favorite tip number

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.240
one, the power stance.

00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:44.550
You may have heard
about this before,

00:00:44.550 --> 00:00:47.550
but it's such a
great, simple exercise

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:50.180
that you can do in
less than a minute.

00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.370
You can see Claire getting
into her power stance.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.790
It's a stance that gives you
a feeling of power, almost

00:00:56.790 --> 00:00:58.334
like a superhero.

00:00:58.334 --> 00:01:00.250
CLAIRE SLATTERY: I'm
pretty proud of this one.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.166
How about you, Arjita?

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:04.892
Nice.

00:01:04.892 --> 00:01:06.600
ARJITA SETHI: The
first time you do this,

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:08.770
it might feel
awkward or strange,

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:12.130
but let your body and
mind sink into the stance.

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:14.949
You have to hold it for
at least 20 seconds.

00:01:14.949 --> 00:01:16.490
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
This gives your mind

00:01:16.490 --> 00:01:19.660
a chance to flood your body
with strong and healthy pathways

00:01:19.660 --> 00:01:22.910
that lead to a feeling of
strength and confidence.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:25.720
ARJITA SETHI: We often
liken it to smile therapy.

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:27.940
Check out the description
below for a link

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:30.200
to get some great
articles about that.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:32.300
But basically, it
is a proven theory

00:01:32.300 --> 00:01:36.390
around increasing your happiness
quotient by forcing yourself

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:38.672
to smile for 15
minutes every day.

00:01:38.672 --> 00:01:40.630
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And
we're doing the same thing

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:43.800
with your confidence by
striking and holding this pose.

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.140
ARJITA SETHI: I'll do this
right before a meeting.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:48.014
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Or
backstage before starting

00:01:48.014 --> 00:01:48.720
my presentation.

00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:50.860
ARJITA SETHI: And on the
set before a video shoot.

00:01:50.860 --> 00:01:53.390
Notice, that I'm
doing my power stance

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.050
in plain sight of the crew.

00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:57.280
This is also sending
a message that I'm

00:01:57.280 --> 00:02:00.112
going to do what I need to
make myself comfortable.

00:02:00.112 --> 00:02:01.570
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
And that's the key

00:02:01.570 --> 00:02:04.970
to taking agency, doing what you
need to do for yourself to be

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.810
comfortable and confident.

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:08.780
So what's another tip, Arjita?

00:02:08.780 --> 00:02:11.623
ARJITA SETHI: Tip number
two, explore the space.

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:17.550
CLAIRE SLATTERY: 10-4 Houston.

00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.260
ARJITA SETHI: Not outer
space, Claire, but rather

00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:23.520
the environment where you're
going to have your meeting,

00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:25.940
shoot your video, or
give your presentation.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:27.330
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Roger, Roger.

00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:28.720
And here's how we do that.

00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:31.860
I walk the floor of the
stage and really take it in.

00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.660
ARJITA SETHI: Or the
floor of meeting room.

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:34.826
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Or the set.

00:02:34.826 --> 00:02:36.710
This is your chance to
just get comfortable

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.780
in the room, notice
where the lights are,

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:41.840
the audience, if there is one,
and your relationship to them.

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:43.897
We'll go over more of that
in the next video too.

00:02:43.897 --> 00:02:44.730
ARJITA SETHI: Right.

00:02:44.730 --> 00:02:47.050
So it's time for
tip number three.

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:48.812
Remember your mantra.

00:02:48.812 --> 00:02:50.770
CLAIRE SLATTERY: In our
elevator pitch exercise

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:53.330
from video number two, we
ended with a quick one word

00:02:53.330 --> 00:02:54.480
summation of your talk.

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:56.650
That word is the key
to your presentation

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:59.340
and should be felt by you
and your audience as well.

00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:01.260
We call it your mantra.

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:03.490
ARJITA SETHI: Your
presentation, talk, or video

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.950
isn't just about information.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:08.580
You want your audience
to feel something.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:11.200
So when we have
our mantra word, we

00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:14.490
can use it to remind
ourselves of that feeling.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:18.845
By repeating that word out loud,
we allow it to really sink in.

00:03:18.845 --> 00:03:20.220
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
And we encourage

00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.500
you to choose a descriptive
word for your mantra.

00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:24.230
ARJITA SETHI: You know
like an adjective.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.110
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Like amused.

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:27.560
ARJITA SETHI: Or alarmed

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.550
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Or excited.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.560
ARJITA SETHI: Then
repeat that word out loud

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:35.350
and really let it take hold
before you give your talk.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:37.600
Give it a shot, Claire.

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.070
CLAIRE SLATTERY: Excited,
excited, excited, excited.

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:43.510
ARJITA SETHI: I
think she's ready.

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.009
OK.

00:03:44.009 --> 00:03:44.900
Let's recap.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.000
Tip number one, power stance.

00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.700
And tip number two,
explore the space.

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.830
And finally, tip number
three, remember your mantra.

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.450
CLAIRE SLATTERY:
Remember your mantra.

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:00.825
ARJITA SETHI: She
said excitedly.

00:04:00.825 --> 00:04:01.740
Thanks for watching.

00:04:01.740 --> 00:04:04.198
CLAIRE SLATTERY: And as always,

like an improviser

00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.470
and develop your voice.
