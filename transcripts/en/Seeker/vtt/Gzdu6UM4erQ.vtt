00:00:02.729 --> 00:00:04.470
Think your colon needs cleansing?

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:06.210
Chances are, it doesn’t.

00:00:06.210 --> 00:00:09.660
And you’re probably doing more harm than
good.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:17.000
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and there’s
a small but persistent population of people

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.740
out there who believe that regular colon cleansings
are good for your body.

00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:25.169
Whether it’s laxatives, enemas, or an actual
colon irrigation - performed by a medical

00:00:25.169 --> 00:00:26.230
practitioner.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:30.349
The idea, they say, is that “it cleans out
all of the toxins that build up on the walls

00:00:30.349 --> 00:00:35.160
of your colon over time” - preventing symptoms
like fatigue, bloating, and even depression

00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:36.160
or cancer.

00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:40.120
It’s true, there are instances where this
kind of procedure is warranted - for example,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:42.570
someone who’s about to undergo a colonoscopy.

00:00:42.570 --> 00:00:46.719
But the vast majority of the people who did
it, don’t actually need it - and over time,

00:00:46.719 --> 00:00:49.580
they could be doing more harm than good.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:54.160
The truth is, your body already has mechanisms
built in, specifically designed to eliminate

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.530
harmful substances.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:57.670
Your liver and kidneys are two of those mechanisms.

00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.000
Plus, there just isn’t enough research yet
on most colon cleanses, to really recommend

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.020
them to anyone who doesn’t have a specific
medical need.

00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:08.930
Not to mention the fact that they have been
known to cause some very serious side effects.

00:01:08.930 --> 00:01:13.320
Certain herbal cleanses, for example, have
been linked to liver toxicity and aplastic

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.730
anemia, which is a rare disorder where your
body stops producing enough red blood cells.

00:01:17.730 --> 00:01:23.050
Other reports have specifically linked colonics
to things like abdominal pain, diarrhea, and

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:28.140
in more serious cases - kidney problems, heart
failure, and life-threatening infections.

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.330
Any scenario where you’re inducing diarrhea
- also carries the risk of disrupting your

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:35.810
body’s electrolyte balance, leading to a
number of health problems.

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:39.970
And that’s especially true for people with
kidney disease or heart problems - who ALREADY

00:01:39.970 --> 00:01:42.450
have trouble maintaining proper fluid balance.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:47.000
The same goes for pregnant and breastfeeding
women, people with GI problems - like Crohn’s

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.640
disease or ulcerative colitis - and people
with connective tissue disorders or severe

00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:55.030
hemorrhoids, who run an increased risk of
bowel perforation.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:59.030
For the general population, though, who has
no known health issues - it’s just not a

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.510
good idea to disrupt the natural balance of
bacteria in your gut.

00:02:02.510 --> 00:02:07.630
It’s like taking antibiotics for a common
cold - yeah, you might get rid of bad bacteria,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.430
but you’re also getting rid of good bacteria
- which puts you at a higher risk for future

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:12.519
infections.

00:02:12.519 --> 00:02:16.340
Some people also like to claim that colon
irrigation is a good method for weight loss

00:02:16.340 --> 00:02:18.420
- which isn’t exactly true.

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:23.920
A 2004 study on colonics, found the average
weight loss of patients to be around 2.6 lbs,

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:25.870
or 1.2 kg.

00:02:25.870 --> 00:02:27.609
Not really a huge difference.

00:02:27.609 --> 00:02:31.049
Not to mention that all you’re disposing
of, is extra water and stool.

00:02:31.049 --> 00:02:34.640
You’re not permanently getting rid of any
fat, so all of that weight will come back

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:36.069
within a couple week’s time.

00:02:36.069 --> 00:02:39.299
Most doctors say that if you’re really interested
in cleaning out your colon, the best thing

00:02:39.299 --> 00:02:43.370
you can do is adjust your diet and make sure
to get plenty of exercise.

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.950
Processed foods, meat, and sugar will only
induce build-up, but foods that are rich in

00:02:47.950 --> 00:02:51.640
fiber - like fruits and vegetables - will
pretty much do all of the work for you.

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:55.080
I know there’s a big debate about this online,
so which side are you on?

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.629
Are you a proponent of regular colon cleansing?

00:02:57.629 --> 00:02:59.629
And if so, what are you experiences with it?

00:02:59.629 --> 00:03:01.930

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:07.619
And as always, thank you guys for watching!
