CORINNE WARNSHUIS:
Hello, everyone.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:11.360
I'm Corinne Warnshuis.

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:13.680
I'm the executive director
of Girl Develop It.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:15.970
And I'm super
excited to be here.

00:00:15.970 --> 00:00:18.310
Today has been really
inspiring for me.

00:00:18.310 --> 00:00:20.720
Really quickly,
for how many of you

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:24.200
is this your first time at
a Women Techmakers event?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:24.840
OK, whoa!

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:25.910
OK, that's awesome.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:29.040
And for how many of you is
this your first time or, maybe,

00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:30.630
one of the rare
instances that you

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:34.690
get to be around like
minded women technologists?

00:00:34.690 --> 00:00:35.580
OK, awesome.

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.090
So I'm glad to see
that some of you

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:41.510
get more frequent
time with other women.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:44.410
So this panel in particular
is really exciting to me

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.470
because the
nonprofit that I run,

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.340
we really are about celebrating
these unconventional journeys.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:52.150
A lot of women come
to Girl Develop It

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.550
who have completely
different backgrounds.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:56.740
So I'm really
excited to be here.

00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:00.940
And I'm also very thankful for
this day for Women Techmakers.

00:01:00.940 --> 00:01:03.120
So thank you to the
team who's put this on.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.420
And I'm really excited.

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:05.750
So let's get started.

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:10.520
And I would love to just start
with, really quickly, intro

00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:11.120
yourselves.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:12.837
And just tell us what
you're working on.

00:01:12.837 --> 00:01:14.045
What are you doing right now?

00:01:14.045 --> 00:01:15.630
PARIELLE LACY: OK, well I am.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:16.750
Whoops, sorry.

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:18.050
I am Parielle Lacy.

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.940
I work here at Google
in the Cambridge office

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.040
on travel, hotels, and flights.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.540
We recently launched a immersive
app that actually shows up

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.940
when you Google the name
of a country and the word

00:01:27.940 --> 00:01:28.860
destinations.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:31.345
And pictures show up, and
we're really excited about it.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:36.160
LUISA HERRMANN:
I'm Luisa Herrmann.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:37.470
I work at EnerNOC.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.890
I'm a product marketing manager.

00:01:38.890 --> 00:01:41.650
And I work with utility
energy management software.

00:01:48.450 --> 00:01:50.550
SUSAN GOLD: I'm Susan Gold.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:53.160
I'm professor of the practice
at Northeastern University

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:54.010
in video games.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.810
And I'm the creator
of the Global Game

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:02.800
Jam, which is, think a
hackathon, but for games.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:04.670
VIDYA GANAPATI: Hi, I'm Vidya.

00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.750
I'm a hardware
engineer at Verily,

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.509
which is a sister
company to Google

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.890
and focuses on life sciences.

00:02:11.890 --> 00:02:13.445
And I work on robotic surgery.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:14.570
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Awesome.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:18.454
OK, so four incredible women
doing very different things.

00:02:18.454 --> 00:02:19.870
And let's just
jump right into it.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:22.500
So how did you get there?

00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:25.670
Who of you and who of you
had a plan step by step

00:02:25.670 --> 00:02:27.570
to get where you were going?

00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:28.122
No one.

00:02:28.122 --> 00:02:29.580
Oh, she had a little
bit of a plan.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:30.091
LUISA HERRMANN: I had it.

00:02:30.091 --> 00:02:31.000
It didn't work out.

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.686
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: OK, cool.

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:32.186
All right.

00:02:32.186 --> 00:02:33.104
So plans work.

00:02:33.104 --> 00:02:34.770
But you know, tell
us about your journey

00:02:34.770 --> 00:02:39.158
and what passions led you to
get to where you are today.

00:02:39.158 --> 00:02:40.870
PARIELLE LACY: OK.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:44.920
So when I was in seventh
grade, I had an assignment.

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.420
I was supposed to pick a
job that I wanted to do.

00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:50.370
And my family grew up
really, really poor.

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:53.060
So they gave us a
list of occupations.

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:55.660
And I just filtered by
whatever paid the most.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.610
And then I looked
at the top five.

00:02:57.610 --> 00:03:00.800
And I was just, OK, lawyer,
computer engineer-- those

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.260
look like two cool things.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:05.570
And when I came into university
when I was an undergrad,

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:07.610
I majored in computer
engineering and political

00:03:07.610 --> 00:03:09.672
science because that's
what pre-law people do.

00:03:09.672 --> 00:03:11.880
And I thought computer
engineering was gonna be like,

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:14.240
I thought they'd give me
silica rocks and maybe string,

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:16.530
and I'd Macgyver a
solar panel out of that.

00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:18.710
But, instead, it was just
all theoretical math,

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.380
at least at the engineering
school that I went to.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:23.880
But computer science
is exactly what

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.004
I thought it would be like.

00:03:25.004 --> 00:03:25.615
I built stuff.

00:03:25.615 --> 00:03:26.490
I got to see it work.

00:03:26.490 --> 00:03:28.030
It happened.

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:30.160
I had test cases, and
I really loved that.

00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.757
So I was just like, OK,
I'll drop engineering and do

00:03:32.757 --> 00:03:33.465
computer science.

00:03:33.465 --> 00:03:35.450
I stuck with political science.

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:39.530
And if I'm being honest, I
thought that I was strictly

00:03:39.530 --> 00:03:44.620
pre-law and computer science
was my backup plan until I

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:46.540
became very disenchanted
with government.

00:03:46.540 --> 00:03:47.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:48.470
Which happens.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:51.400
The more you study politics,
you're just, like, wow.

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:52.410
There's just no way.

00:03:52.410 --> 00:03:54.480
And actually, while
I'm mentioning

00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:56.790
that, the economy
between the efficiency

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.610
that comes with computer
science and the complete-- no.

00:04:00.610 --> 00:04:01.362
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:01.362 --> 00:04:03.570
[? No-ness ?] of political
science and just politics,

00:04:03.570 --> 00:04:05.350
in general, is just strange.

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:08.400
And as I progressed through,
I did political internships.

00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:09.950
I did computer
science internships.

00:04:09.950 --> 00:04:11.980
I interned at Zinga.

00:04:11.980 --> 00:04:14.180
And by the time my senior
came, I was just like,

00:04:14.180 --> 00:04:17.720
I really like working
in computer science,

00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.899
I really don't want to
be in school anymore,

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:24.270
and I loved what I was doing.

00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:25.980
So I stuck with
computer science.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:29.010
And now I'm software
engineer here at Google.

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:30.780
Still considering
political type stuff.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.930
So I volunteer a
lot with politics.

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:33.900
Also, please vote.

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:34.752
[LAUGHTER]

00:04:34.752 --> 00:04:37.140
Please register.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:39.499
SUSAN GOLD: I was
going to say-- so I'm

00:04:39.499 --> 00:04:41.540
a little older than everyone
that's on the panel.

00:04:41.540 --> 00:04:45.250
And I would have to say
I've had lots of plans.

00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:49.700
And I think that it's great
to have plans and strategize,

00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:53.224
but always be willing to
just pivot at any moment.

00:04:53.224 --> 00:04:54.640
That's one of the
things that I've

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.790
learned is that you can't
expect what's gonna come at you.

00:04:59.790 --> 00:05:03.730
And you just have to be,
am I ready for it or not?

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:06.880
And I mean, to be honest,
when I was in high school,

00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:10.290
they were pushing me to
be a flight attendant.

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:13.060
I mean, I graduated in 1980.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:19.590
And that's where the guidance
counselor was pushing me

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:20.755
because I loved to travel.

00:05:20.755 --> 00:05:22.630
So that meant I should
be a flight attendant.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:24.380
[LAUGHTER]

00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:26.940
I mean, how crazy is
that in this day and age.

00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:31.520
But, at the same time, every
experience that you have

00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:34.790
helps fashion the next plan.

00:05:34.790 --> 00:05:37.630
So it just gets you prepared
for what comes next.

00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:42.530
So although I would have plans
when I got into video games,

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:44.750
I had no idea how I
got to video games.

00:05:44.750 --> 00:05:47.290
It was like, oh, we
decided you're going

00:05:47.290 --> 00:05:48.870
to be teaching video games.

00:05:48.870 --> 00:05:51.430
And I was like, what?

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.440
It wasn't in the plan.

00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:58.070
And you just either drop the
ball, or you throw the ball.

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.700
Or you're like, wait, I'm
gonna recreate this game.

00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.840
And you're like, I'm
going to do this.

00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.100
And then you just pivot.

00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.960
And you're like, OK, now I'm
an expert in video games.

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.460
Wow.

00:06:09.460 --> 00:06:10.170
[LAUGHTER]

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:13.380
But it happens to all of us.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.470
You didn't know you were
gonna be an expert in an area

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.465
until you're the
expert in the area.

00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:21.420
And I think that that's
one of the things

00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:25.960
that, no matter how many plans
we make or things that we do,

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.430
I think that it's that ability
to adapt and to not be afraid.

00:06:30.430 --> 00:06:31.590
And we're all afraid.

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:34.830
But it's like not to let
them know that you're afraid.

00:06:34.830 --> 00:06:38.200
And I think that's
really how you

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.685
manage to navigate your plans.

00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:43.440
Like, oh, I thought it
was going down this path

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:44.920
but, oops, dead end.

00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:48.182
Or oops, there's an obstacle.

00:06:48.182 --> 00:06:50.390
And that obstacle could be
a lot of different things.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.390
And it could be
just your expertise.

00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:53.920
So you make a different plan.

00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.580
And that's what I think
successful women do

00:06:56.580 --> 00:07:01.025
is they're ready to
jump on the next plan.

00:07:01.025 --> 00:07:02.290
LUISA HERRMANN: Right.

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:08.520
So I actually started out-- I
was born and raised in Brazil.

00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:10.350
And I moved to the
US to go to college.

00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:12.180
And now I'm a product
marketing manager.

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.410
But I actually have a degree
in chemical engineering.

00:07:15.410 --> 00:07:19.419
And my plan was that I was
going to work in process design.

00:07:19.419 --> 00:07:21.460
And I was going to make
processes more efficient.

00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:23.780
And by that I meant
strictly chemical processes.

00:07:23.780 --> 00:07:25.530
But, as it turns out,
there are more types

00:07:25.530 --> 00:07:28.710
of processes to make efficient.

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:30.650
And so while all
of my classmates

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:32.850
were looking for jobs in
finance and consulting

00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:35.140
in New York City, my
first job out of college

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.420
was at a manufacturing plant in
Cleveland, Ohio, which is great

00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:40.882
if you're a 22-year-old woman.

00:07:40.882 --> 00:07:43.720
[LAUGHTER]

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.990
So I did that for a little bit.

00:07:45.990 --> 00:07:47.240
And it was really interesting.

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:49.744
But I was making all of
these changes to processes

00:07:49.744 --> 00:07:51.410
and to the products
that we were making.

00:07:51.410 --> 00:07:55.312
And I didn't know what result
that had down the line.

00:07:55.312 --> 00:07:57.145
I didn't know how that
affected the business

00:07:57.145 --> 00:07:59.191
or how that affected
what we were selling.

00:07:59.191 --> 00:08:01.440
And this is a great story
that I might save for later,

00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.020
but I ended up pivoting
from plant manufacturing

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.190
to marketing.

00:08:07.190 --> 00:08:09.440
I got a job as a
marketing specialist.

00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:12.730
And that's how I moved to
Boston, which was a little bit

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:14.966
different telling my
parents, thank you

00:08:14.966 --> 00:08:16.590
for the degree in
chemical engineering.

00:08:16.590 --> 00:08:19.290
I'm gonna go be a
marketing specialist now.

00:08:19.290 --> 00:08:20.374
It took them a little bit.

00:08:20.374 --> 00:08:22.123
I think that they still
tell their friends

00:08:22.123 --> 00:08:24.590
that their daughter is an
engineer, which is fair enough.

00:08:24.590 --> 00:08:25.820
I am.

00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:30.320
But I managed to find my
way through-- I wanted

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:31.660
to go back into technology.

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:34.190
I wanted to learn just
enough about business

00:08:34.190 --> 00:08:36.409
to make myself a
better engineer.

00:08:36.409 --> 00:08:38.710
And so I kept plotting
my return into tech.

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.110
And then a year and a
half into marketing,

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.490
I was recruited for a
job in product marketing.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:47.470
And that was also gonna
make me a better engineer.

00:08:47.470 --> 00:08:49.671
That was three years ago.

00:08:49.671 --> 00:08:51.920
It turns out that engineering
made me a better product

00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:54.664
marketer and that being
a marketing specialist

00:08:54.664 --> 00:08:56.080
made me a better
product marketer.

00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:58.205
And now I just want to be
the best product marketer

00:08:58.205 --> 00:09:00.895
that I can be while my parents
tell their friends that I'm

00:09:00.895 --> 00:09:02.020
their engineering daughter.

00:09:02.020 --> 00:09:04.500
[LAUGHTER]

00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:06.932
SUSAN GOLD: I've
already said [? mine. ?]

00:09:06.932 --> 00:09:07.890
VIDYA GANAPATI: Oh, OK.

00:09:07.890 --> 00:09:11.040
So, yeah, I guess I'm
also like Parielle.

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:15.770
I'm starting out in my
career, not like Susan who's

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.490
had a lot more experience.

00:09:17.490 --> 00:09:21.470
But in undergrad, when I
went to the career fair,

00:09:21.470 --> 00:09:23.880
there was all these
software companies hiring.

00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:26.100
And I thought, wow, so boring.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:28.690
I will never do that.

00:09:28.690 --> 00:09:33.240
But then I realized as
I went through college

00:09:33.240 --> 00:09:36.810
and then graduate school
was I really interested

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.840
in global problems.

00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.140
I was really interested in
poverty, hunger, renewable

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.110
energy.

00:09:44.110 --> 00:09:47.920
And I found that I really
could use software skills

00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:49.320
in these fields.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:52.470
And when it was something that
was really exciting to me,

00:09:52.470 --> 00:09:55.020
an application that I really
felt passionate about,

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:59.640
I was much more interested in
software and computer science.

00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.750
So I actually ended up
doing my PhD in solar cells.

00:10:03.750 --> 00:10:06.230
And my PhD was actually
entirely software.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:08.580
It was entirely computational.

00:10:08.580 --> 00:10:12.380
And then now I'm here
at Google or, I guess,

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:15.820
Verily, which I still
think is part of Google.

00:10:15.820 --> 00:10:18.070
And I'm working
on robotic surgery

00:10:18.070 --> 00:10:20.960
and really using software
skills to do something, which

00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:24.120
I find very meaningful
in trying to do

00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:26.272
minimally invasive surgery.

00:10:26.272 --> 00:10:27.230
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Wow.

00:10:27.230 --> 00:10:28.860
OK, awesome.

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:31.700
So what strategies
have each of you

00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.780
used to grow your
career beyond what

00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:36.590
seemed within reach to you?

00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:40.320
And what advice would
you give to the audience

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:43.330
interested in stretching
themselves to that next step?

00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:44.870
Sarah, this morning,
talked earlier

00:10:44.870 --> 00:10:48.810
about recognizing your own
power and owning your expertise

00:10:48.810 --> 00:10:50.890
as a way to advance your career.

00:10:50.890 --> 00:10:54.170
So what advice do you all have?

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:56.890
SUSAN GOLD: It's
about your network.

00:10:56.890 --> 00:11:02.490
I mean, I try to tell my
students over and over again.

00:11:02.490 --> 00:11:03.960
It's not necessarily
what you know.

00:11:03.960 --> 00:11:05.176
It's who you know.

00:11:05.176 --> 00:11:07.300
And it helps to be smart.

00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:11.530
But it is really about
making those connections.

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:15.750
And I work very hard at
maintaining my connections

00:11:15.750 --> 00:11:18.510
at this point in my life
because there are so many,

00:11:18.510 --> 00:11:22.200
and the world has changed so
much, and we're so connected.

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:24.550
But it's doing those
follow-up emails.

00:11:24.550 --> 00:11:28.100
It's doing the, hey, I
heard you were doing this,

00:11:28.100 --> 00:11:29.440
and that sounds really cool.

00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:30.570
Keep me informed.

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:35.910
It's the being active and not
just collecting business cards

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:38.660
and having a huge number
of LinkedIn contacts

00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:39.590
or anything like that.

00:11:39.590 --> 00:11:41.560
It's working that group.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.310
And I try to make sure
that the things that I

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.230
do that I reach
people out to are

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.060
things that they care about.

00:11:49.060 --> 00:11:51.460
So a lot of my work
is about creating

00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.100
positive social impact.

00:11:53.100 --> 00:11:56.250
It's about
democratization of tools.

00:11:56.250 --> 00:11:59.170
It's about creating
diversity in games.

00:11:59.170 --> 00:12:03.330
And all of these things mean
that I can't do it by myself.

00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.590
I have to do it with people
that are like-minded,

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:08.370
that I care about
what I'm doing--

00:12:08.370 --> 00:12:12.640
or at least profess to--
and then ask them for help.

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:14.580
And if you don't
use that network,

00:12:14.580 --> 00:12:17.190
then it doesn't matter how
many cards you've collected,

00:12:17.190 --> 00:12:20.330
or how many parties you
attend, or how many events you

00:12:20.330 --> 00:12:23.060
participate in, you need
to be able to leverage

00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:25.060
that in a positive way.

00:12:25.060 --> 00:12:28.910
And I find that my
best success are

00:12:28.910 --> 00:12:31.200
in the relationships
I've created,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:38.450
and use those people as sounding
board and part of my everyday.

00:12:38.450 --> 00:12:41.270
And it's not just
one person I know,

00:12:41.270 --> 00:12:44.010
but one person who's actively
engaged in the things

00:12:44.010 --> 00:12:45.110
that I'm doing.

00:12:45.110 --> 00:12:47.870
And it takes a lot of work.

00:12:47.870 --> 00:12:49.520
It doesn't come easy.

00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:54.770
You have a big network because
you are actively talking

00:12:54.770 --> 00:12:57.340
to them on a regular basis.

00:12:57.340 --> 00:12:59.840
LUISA HERRMANN: I would remind
everyone that half of success

00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:02.110
is just showing up.

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.770
It's one of the things that
took me a while to learn.

00:13:04.770 --> 00:13:06.660
And I'm still pretty
early in my career.

00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.270
So I don't know how much
leeway I get with saying that.

00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:10.770
But one of the
things that I learned

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:14.430
is that not everyone wants
the same things that you want.

00:13:14.430 --> 00:13:17.580
So you can't assume that
everybody knows what you want

00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.510
and will help you get there.

00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:22.040
So learn how to ask
for what you want.

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.400
Learn how to tell
people what you want

00:13:24.400 --> 00:13:25.990
and what you don't want.

00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:28.521
That's also equally important.

00:13:28.521 --> 00:13:31.020
The beginning of your career--
and the rest of your career--

00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.090
is going to be
about figuring out

00:13:32.090 --> 00:13:33.923
what it is that you
want to do but, equally,

00:13:33.923 --> 00:13:35.449
what you don't want to do.

00:13:35.449 --> 00:13:36.990
And it took a really
long time for me

00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.614
to be able to admit that I don't
have to be good at everything.

00:13:39.614 --> 00:13:42.090
And I can tell people,
I'm not good at this.

00:13:42.090 --> 00:13:43.689
Maybe I should do
something else.

00:13:43.689 --> 00:13:46.230
And so be able to say these are
the things that I want to do.

00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:48.146
And this is where I want
to go with my career.

00:13:48.146 --> 00:13:51.088
Will you please help me?

00:13:51.088 --> 00:13:54.830
PARIELLE LACY: I think
it also helps to be nosy.

00:13:54.830 --> 00:13:58.157
Sometimes I think that their
career paths are like-- OK,

00:13:58.157 --> 00:13:59.740
I think actually a
better anecdote is.

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:04.430
I do admissions interviews
for Brown University.

00:14:04.430 --> 00:14:08.390
And it seems like students do
not know other jobs that exist.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:12.920
They all say doctor, lawyer
and, on occasion, CEO.

00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.210
And those are the only
three things I often hear.

00:14:16.210 --> 00:14:21.230
And I think that sometimes going
off of how to attain a goal

00:14:21.230 --> 00:14:23.620
is also determining
what goals you want.

00:14:23.620 --> 00:14:26.420
And sometimes there are things
that you don't even know exist.

00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.940
There are jobs out there that
you don't know that people do.

00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:33.063
Someone designs boxes for Lego
waffles and-- Eggo waffles,

00:14:33.063 --> 00:14:35.270
or whatever it's called.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.830
So I think just asking people
how they got to where they are

00:14:37.830 --> 00:14:41.010
and what they do is not
only a good icebreaker

00:14:41.010 --> 00:14:42.800
but also really
informs your decisions

00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:44.760
in what your goals are.

00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.580
Or it doesn't have
to be occupational.

00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:48.176
Other things in your life also.

00:14:48.176 --> 00:14:50.515
SUSAN GOLD: Yeah, people love
to talk about themselves.

00:14:50.515 --> 00:14:51.237
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:51.237 --> 00:14:52.490
They do.

00:14:52.490 --> 00:14:53.290
Look at us.

00:14:53.290 --> 00:14:54.613
[LAUGHTER]

00:14:55.495 --> 00:14:59.530
The truth is, I mean, when you
take an interest in someone,

00:14:59.530 --> 00:15:01.950
they take an interest in you.

00:15:01.950 --> 00:15:05.170
And it's that creating
that relationship part that

00:15:05.170 --> 00:15:08.410
is so important because
it opens so many doors

00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:09.480
and windows for you.

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:12.210
And it's opportunities
for you to see new things

00:15:12.210 --> 00:15:14.430
that you didn't have any
idea that you wanted to do.

00:15:14.430 --> 00:15:19.530
So, I mean, that's one of the
greatest things about curiosity

00:15:19.530 --> 00:15:23.830
of being young and of
being ready to do things

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:25.830
because you just don't
know what's ahead of you.

00:15:25.830 --> 00:15:27.570
And you're just like, oh, OK.

00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.050
But it's that having
that excitement.

00:15:31.050 --> 00:15:33.194
And then that
nosiness, I think--

00:15:33.194 --> 00:15:34.860
I don't know if I
would call it nosiness

00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.400
because I think people
have a negative connotation

00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:38.010
about that.

00:15:38.010 --> 00:15:41.820
But curiosity, inquisitiveness,
that kind of stuff,

00:15:41.820 --> 00:15:43.360
I think people really like that.

00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:44.860
CORINNE WARNSHUIS:
Yeah, definitely.

00:15:44.860 --> 00:15:49.232
So show up, follow-up,
and be curious.

00:15:49.232 --> 00:15:50.450
Right?

00:15:50.450 --> 00:15:54.780
OK, so this question is a
little bit related to that.

00:15:54.780 --> 00:15:56.220
You're good, right?

00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:56.780
That's good.

00:15:56.780 --> 00:16:00.580
OK, so it's common that
women and people of color

00:16:00.580 --> 00:16:05.650
don't share their
work successes enough,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:09.570
which can impact their careers
and potential promotion.

00:16:09.570 --> 00:16:13.230
So why is advocating
for yourself important?

00:16:13.230 --> 00:16:15.800
And what are the ways that you
have done this in the past?

00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:17.590
LUISA HERRMANN: You have
to advocate for yourself

00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:19.423
because you can't really
rely on anyone else

00:16:19.423 --> 00:16:20.575
to advocate for you.

00:16:20.575 --> 00:16:22.130
You can hope for it.

00:16:22.130 --> 00:16:24.510
If you're lucky, you'll get it.

00:16:24.510 --> 00:16:26.310
But you can't really
rely on somebody else.

00:16:26.310 --> 00:16:30.640
You know your strengths better
than anybody else, hopefully.

00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.390
You know what you want
better than anybody else.

00:16:33.390 --> 00:16:36.920
And so you are the best
person to advocate for you.

00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.370
You're also the best person
to give other people tools

00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:41.530
to advocate for you, as well.

00:16:41.530 --> 00:16:43.930
Say what you want and
what it is that you need,

00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:45.460
and have them help.

00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:48.160
But you have to believe in
yourself first for other people

00:16:48.160 --> 00:16:48.950
to believe in you.

00:16:48.950 --> 00:16:51.120
And I know this sounds so
corny like I'm sitting up here.

00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:52.869
It's like I might as
well be Instagramming

00:16:52.869 --> 00:16:53.930
this with a filter.

00:16:53.930 --> 00:16:56.250
But really, if you
believe in yourself

00:16:56.250 --> 00:16:59.870
and you tell people I can
do this, just let me do this

00:16:59.870 --> 00:17:02.190
and believe in
it, you have to be

00:17:02.190 --> 00:17:05.614
your best friend and your
first champion, really.

00:17:05.614 --> 00:17:06.866
SUSAN GOLD: So easy to say.

00:17:06.866 --> 00:17:07.824
LUISA HERRMANN: I know.

00:17:07.824 --> 00:17:09.880
It's so easy to say
and so hard to do.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:10.630
It takes practice.

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:12.671
I mean, the first time
you advocate for yourself,

00:17:12.671 --> 00:17:14.099
it feels really awkward.

00:17:14.099 --> 00:17:16.550
It really does for everybody.

00:17:16.550 --> 00:17:18.386
I mean, can I tell a
story now because this

00:17:18.386 --> 00:17:19.344
is gonna be really fun?

00:17:19.344 --> 00:17:19.619
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Yeah.

00:17:19.619 --> 00:17:21.270
LUISA HERRMANN: So
the reason I got

00:17:21.270 --> 00:17:23.953
the marketing job when I
was working at a plant was I

00:17:23.953 --> 00:17:25.619
really wanted to do
something different.

00:17:25.619 --> 00:17:27.035
But nobody at the
plant understood

00:17:27.035 --> 00:17:29.527
what it is that I wanted to
do because I didn't understand

00:17:29.527 --> 00:17:30.360
what I wanted to do.

00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:32.110
I said, I want to be
in the business side.

00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:33.550
That means nothing.

00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:39.140
So a general manager for another
division of the same company

00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.810
came to visit our facility.

00:17:40.810 --> 00:17:42.950
And he said, you're
doing a great job

00:17:42.950 --> 00:17:48.210
and what is it that
I can do to help you?

00:17:48.210 --> 00:17:51.760
A lot of times, people aren't
going to ask you this directly.

00:17:51.760 --> 00:17:54.410
But they want to
know, so be prepared.

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.540
I wasn't.

00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.280
And my response was, you
can give me another job.

00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:00.600
[LAUGHTER]

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:04.490
Which, while you're
at your current job,

00:18:04.490 --> 00:18:06.690
is, perhaps, not the
best thing you can do.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.920
But it worked out that one time.

00:18:08.920 --> 00:18:10.890
I asked him, I want to
be on the business side.

00:18:10.890 --> 00:18:12.840
And he said, do
you mean marketing?

00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.100
And I said, maybe.

00:18:15.100 --> 00:18:15.600
Why?

00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.660
He's like, I have
a marketing role.

00:18:16.660 --> 00:18:17.420
Do you want it?

00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:19.120
And I said, yes.

00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:22.377
And so it was
asking for something

00:18:22.377 --> 00:18:24.335
and getting it, and having
that one opportunity

00:18:24.335 --> 00:18:27.260
when I was like, I want a job.

00:18:27.260 --> 00:18:30.320
I wouldn't recommend it
for everybody at all times.

00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:31.745
My manager is
sitting right there.

00:18:31.745 --> 00:18:32.920
So keep that in mind.

00:18:35.650 --> 00:18:38.920
VIDYA GANAPATI: OK, so I just
want to start by saying I'm

00:18:38.920 --> 00:18:42.855
pretty terrible at
advocating for myself.

00:18:42.855 --> 00:18:44.710
So I was a graduate student.

00:18:44.710 --> 00:18:47.900
So I've applied for a lot
of things like fellowships.

00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.060
And whenever I would
see a fellowship,

00:18:50.060 --> 00:18:51.106
I would read through it.

00:18:51.106 --> 00:18:52.022
I'd be like, OK, yeah.

00:18:52.022 --> 00:18:54.970
I can write 20 pages
about my research.

00:18:54.970 --> 00:18:56.180
I can do all this stuff.

00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:57.720
But then I would
see, oh, you need

00:18:57.720 --> 00:18:59.280
to get recommendation letters.

00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.490
And then I'd be like, no,
I can't apply to this.

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:03.710
But then you just have to do it.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.190
You just have to power
through and ask for it.

00:19:06.190 --> 00:19:10.300
And I found that sometimes
people do say no.

00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:12.880
And it's kind of
embarrassing when they say no

00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:14.590
and you've put
yourself out there.

00:19:14.590 --> 00:19:18.960
But, really, you just
have to be like I did it.

00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:20.525
Like, at least I asked.

00:19:20.525 --> 00:19:23.070
So I think you just
have to keep in mind

00:19:23.070 --> 00:19:25.795
to just be proud of
yourself for asking.

00:19:25.795 --> 00:19:27.640
And let that override
other feelings.

00:19:31.606 --> 00:19:35.450
SUSAN GOLD: I think,
from my perspective,

00:19:35.450 --> 00:19:37.680
the more successful
I become, the more I

00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:39.030
feel like I'm a fraud.

00:19:39.030 --> 00:19:42.210
And I don't know if
that's just a cultural,

00:19:42.210 --> 00:19:44.089
or related to the
gender, or just age.

00:19:44.089 --> 00:19:45.630
CORINNE WARNSHUIS:
Imposter syndrome.

00:19:45.630 --> 00:19:46.900
SUSAN GOLD: Imposter syndrome.

00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:50.250
You know, it's like, why do
you look to me for advice?

00:19:50.250 --> 00:19:51.455
Like, I'm a professor.

00:19:51.455 --> 00:19:52.490
Oh, OK.

00:19:52.490 --> 00:19:55.100
I get it.

00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:57.260
I'm supposed to know
what I'm talking about.

00:19:57.260 --> 00:19:57.870
And I do.

00:19:57.870 --> 00:19:59.650
I know that I know
what I'm talking about.

00:19:59.650 --> 00:20:05.750
But, honestly, I think that
maybe because of how I grew up

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.520
or when I grew up, it's really,
really hard to say I did that.

00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:11.880
That was me.

00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:14.070
Or, wasn't that awesome?

00:20:14.070 --> 00:20:18.090
And so I've started trying
doing that at home to people

00:20:18.090 --> 00:20:18.590
that I love.

00:20:18.590 --> 00:20:20.080
I'm like, isn't that awesome?

00:20:20.080 --> 00:20:21.480
I did that.

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:22.750
And they start cracking up.

00:20:22.750 --> 00:20:26.480
I'm like, yeah, that's
exactly how I feel.

00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:28.100
But I feel proud when I do it.

00:20:28.100 --> 00:20:30.070
I'm like, I did that.

00:20:30.070 --> 00:20:34.295
And my family laughs at me.

00:20:34.295 --> 00:20:37.110
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: OK, so this
might be a little bit easier

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:39.440
then for you all.

00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:42.810
There are over 12,000 women
participating in Women

00:20:42.810 --> 00:20:44.300
Techmakers events this month.

00:20:44.300 --> 00:20:45.770
So two questions.

00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:47.270
What can we do as
a global community

00:20:47.270 --> 00:20:48.450
to lift each other up?

00:20:48.450 --> 00:20:51.410
It's sometimes easier to
lift others up than yourself.

00:20:51.410 --> 00:20:55.200
And what do you do personally
to lift those around you up?

00:20:55.200 --> 00:20:57.100
Do you mentor?

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:58.360
In what ways do you give back?

00:21:01.102 --> 00:21:04.980
PARIELLE LACY: So I have a
lot of unofficial mentees

00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.274
and also official mentees
through Brown University.

00:21:07.274 --> 00:21:09.190
I get a lot of students
who contact me and ask

00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:09.520
me questions.

00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.670
And I'm just like, yeah.

00:21:10.670 --> 00:21:12.277
Then I send out
emails, reminders,

00:21:12.277 --> 00:21:13.360
and things of that nature.

00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:16.839
And I think those
things are important.

00:21:16.839 --> 00:21:19.380
I think, for obvious reasons,
obviously, people need support.

00:21:19.380 --> 00:21:20.730
People need validation.

00:21:20.730 --> 00:21:23.230
Sometimes there's just like,
is this an OK email to send?

00:21:23.230 --> 00:21:27.270
Sometimes sending emails
to professors or even

00:21:27.270 --> 00:21:30.064
prospective employers,
it's just really difficult

00:21:30.064 --> 00:21:30.980
to see what they want.

00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.229
And I'm just like, no,
actually we want two sentences.

00:21:33.229 --> 00:21:34.500
I have a lot to do today.

00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.432
So if you can make it
a little bit shorter.

00:21:37.432 --> 00:21:39.390
And other things that
are important, obviously,

00:21:39.390 --> 00:21:40.600
because I'm a little
bit political,

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:42.630
I'm going to say that
education policy, I think,

00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:43.950
is very important.

00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:48.580
I know there's a push for tech
to get AP, computer science,

00:21:48.580 --> 00:21:50.182
and stuff in some schools.

00:21:50.182 --> 00:21:51.890
But I think it should
be more widespread.

00:21:51.890 --> 00:21:54.170
And I think that when those
initiatives pop-up or you see

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:55.570
something, you should
try to support them

00:21:55.570 --> 00:21:57.986
in any type of way possible,
whether it be voting or maybe

00:21:57.986 --> 00:22:01.959
even donating
money to campaigns.

00:22:01.959 --> 00:22:03.000
Yeah, that's [INAUDIBLE].

00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:05.254
And also, obviously,
people often

00:22:05.254 --> 00:22:06.670
will reach out to
you if they feel

00:22:06.670 --> 00:22:08.860
like they have some type
of commonality with you,

00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:11.869
whether it be alumni connections
or they notice that you're

00:22:11.869 --> 00:22:13.660
the only woman at your
company, and they're

00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:15.400
interested in working
at your company.

00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:17.358
And so just be supportive
of that relationship.

00:22:17.358 --> 00:22:23.140
And understand that when someone
else is reaching out to you,

00:22:23.140 --> 00:22:24.460
you're the person in charge.

00:22:24.460 --> 00:22:28.000
And you decide where that
goes because they don't know

00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.275
what they can get from you.

00:22:29.275 --> 00:22:30.566
But you know what you can give.

00:22:34.091 --> 00:22:35.590
SUSAN GOLD: So I'm a professor.

00:22:35.590 --> 00:22:39.960
So that's my job is
to mentor students.

00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.460
And in a field of games, when
I look out into my classroom

00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:46.945
and I see a woman,
I'm like, ah, there's

00:22:46.945 --> 00:22:48.070
another woman in the class!

00:22:48.070 --> 00:22:49.180
I'm so excited!

00:22:49.180 --> 00:22:51.530
And I make a big deal out of it.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:56.080
And then the guys
are like, yeah, so?

00:22:56.080 --> 00:23:02.640
But it is a big deal to look out
and not just see a sea of guys

00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.540
out there.

00:23:03.540 --> 00:23:09.160
And when I talk to even the
male students in mentoring them,

00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.250
they have many of the
same issues that women do.

00:23:13.250 --> 00:23:17.080
And very often, a lot of people
have other things besides that.

00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.915
And it's just being
there to listen.

00:23:19.915 --> 00:23:21.970
You may not have
answers for people.

00:23:21.970 --> 00:23:24.344
But you're there
to support them.

00:23:24.344 --> 00:23:25.760
And you're also
there to encourage

00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:28.570
them to do more than
they're currently doing.

00:23:28.570 --> 00:23:32.210
So as a professor, that's
one of your ultimate goals

00:23:32.210 --> 00:23:35.870
is to get them to do
more outside of class.

00:23:35.870 --> 00:23:39.560
And it's like do these
things, attend these things,

00:23:39.560 --> 00:23:43.460
participate, make more
games, go to meetings

00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:45.780
for the game developers
club, whatever,

00:23:45.780 --> 00:23:48.370
and encourage people to go.

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.860
Everybody thinks like,
oh, I won't fit in.

00:23:51.860 --> 00:23:54.031
They're too nerdy for me.

00:23:54.031 --> 00:23:55.530
They only play
Dungeons and Dragons.

00:23:55.530 --> 00:24:00.030
Whatever it is, you can go and
say, I want to play this game.

00:24:00.030 --> 00:24:01.370
Or, I want to do this.

00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:03.770
And you can dictate
those things.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:06.340
So I sit around spending a
lot of time telling women

00:24:06.340 --> 00:24:07.520
that they can do it.

00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:09.616
Yes, you can.

00:24:09.616 --> 00:24:12.560
And it sounds so silly
and so trivial-- yes, you

00:24:12.560 --> 00:24:13.540
can-- but you can.

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:22.680
For me to go to a cocktail party
to network and to meet people,

00:24:22.680 --> 00:24:24.810
I'm just as nervous
as everyone else.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:26.510
It's not my favorite
place to be.

00:24:26.510 --> 00:24:31.020
Given my choice, I'd rather be
home with the dog, and remote

00:24:31.020 --> 00:24:33.630
and, you know, a
glass of wine, and not

00:24:33.630 --> 00:24:39.010
have to worry about wearing high
heels or anything like that.

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:43.590
I would prefer that
mentee kind of thing

00:24:43.590 --> 00:24:45.880
is just something that
became natural for all of us,

00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:47.710
that we just support each other.

00:24:47.710 --> 00:24:50.330
And as you said, 12,000
women participating in this.

00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:53.380
Think of all the women
that didn't get to come.

00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.400
And they're going to need
your support and the things

00:24:56.400 --> 00:25:00.280
that you learned here to
carry that out with you.

00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:02.170
And that's really
important, as well.

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.370
We're not living
alone on an island.

00:25:05.370 --> 00:25:06.380
We're here together.

00:25:06.380 --> 00:25:10.540
And how we impact each other
is incredibly important.

00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.380
And how we do that
means sometimes

00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:16.420
just sitting and smiling
and listen to someone.

00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.360
And that's sometimes all it
takes to give someone the nerve

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:22.720
to go ahead and move forward
and to change their lives.

00:25:25.877 --> 00:25:29.452
VIDYA GANAPATI: So just a
question for the audience.

00:25:29.452 --> 00:25:31.160
Has anybody heard of
Girls Who Code or is

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:32.840
involved with Girls Who Code?

00:25:32.840 --> 00:25:34.770
Are you teachers?

00:25:34.770 --> 00:25:35.860
Teachers?

00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:36.730
Any other teachers?

00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:40.270
OK, so I was a teacher
for the summer immersion

00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:41.780
program of Girls Who Code.

00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.320
And I highly encourage anyone
in this room to get involved,

00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.890
be a teacher or a
teaching assistant.

00:25:47.890 --> 00:25:51.020
And I spent seven
weeks this past summer

00:25:51.020 --> 00:25:57.650
working with a group of 20
16- and 17-year-old girls.

00:25:57.650 --> 00:26:02.590
And we just did seven weeks
of intense computer science

00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:03.600
curriculum.

00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.880
And really, what the
mission of Girls Who Code

00:26:06.880 --> 00:26:09.610
is that they see that
if you have exposure

00:26:09.610 --> 00:26:12.530
to things in high school, you're
much more likely to pursue them

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:14.300
in college.

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.660
And this is why so
many people are history

00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.570
and English majors is because
you liked it in high school.

00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:22.230
And so the idea is
that if you get exposed

00:26:22.230 --> 00:26:23.770
to computer science
in high school,

00:26:23.770 --> 00:26:25.670
you're much more
likely to pursue it.

00:26:25.670 --> 00:26:29.120
So that's something I'm
very passionate about, just

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:32.680
mentoring girls at the
middle school and high school

00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.420
level, the age where
you're trying to figure out

00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:38.000
what you're interested in.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:41.140
And what I told my girls
at the end of the summer,

00:26:41.140 --> 00:26:43.760
I was like, well, you had
this really lucky gift

00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.250
of this program.

00:26:45.250 --> 00:26:47.590
And you've been able
to learn how to code.

00:26:47.590 --> 00:26:51.110
And now you need to go out and
teach at least one other person

00:26:51.110 --> 00:26:52.060
how to code.

00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:57.990
So I think that's my philosophy.

00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:00.690
Just teach at least
one other person,

00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.100
or tell another person
what you learned

00:27:03.100 --> 00:27:06.280
from today, like the code
[? sprint, ?] for example.

00:27:06.280 --> 00:27:09.290
And really, that's how
you spread the word.

00:27:09.290 --> 00:27:10.956
CORINNE WARNSHUIS:
Yeah, that's awesome.

00:27:10.956 --> 00:27:12.747
Yeah, there are tons
of great organizations

00:27:12.747 --> 00:27:15.170
that you can give back
to, like Girls Who Code,

00:27:15.170 --> 00:27:16.572
like Black Girls Code.

00:27:16.572 --> 00:27:19.660
CoderDojo is another
one that has groups

00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:22.272
all across the country
that teach young,

00:27:22.272 --> 00:27:23.730
I think, middle
school children how

00:27:23.730 --> 00:27:26.340
to code if that's something
you're interested in.

00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.520
The organization that
I run, Girl Develop It,

00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.146
we have some chapter leaders
in the house from Boston.

00:27:32.146 --> 00:27:32.770
There they are.

00:27:32.770 --> 00:27:34.980
So talk to them if you're
interested in giving back

00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:37.512
to an organization that
teaches adult women.

00:27:37.512 --> 00:27:38.012
Oh, wait.

00:27:38.012 --> 00:27:39.680
We also have Providence
in the house.

00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:40.640
Providence, raise your hand.

00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:41.223
Raise it high.

00:27:41.223 --> 00:27:42.540
Come on.

00:27:42.540 --> 00:27:45.310
And so these women are
leaders in their communities.

00:27:45.310 --> 00:27:48.794
And they recruit
teachers to come teach,

00:27:48.794 --> 00:27:50.710
and many of them who
have never taught before.

00:27:50.710 --> 00:27:52.450
So if you're thinking I
could never teach a class,

00:27:52.450 --> 00:27:53.010
yes, you can.

00:27:53.010 --> 00:27:53.635
You really can.

00:27:53.635 --> 00:27:54.880
Believe me.

00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:59.420
We've brought many
women up through being

00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:01.760
students to TA-ing classes.

00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.975
And these classes are
Intro to HTML CSS to Intro

00:28:04.975 --> 00:28:06.900
to Python, et cetera.

00:28:06.900 --> 00:28:10.210
And so if you have a need
to teach, or want to teach,

00:28:10.210 --> 00:28:12.410
or want to be among
women learning,

00:28:12.410 --> 00:28:13.930
definitely check
out Girl Develop It

00:28:13.930 --> 00:28:17.310
because we're in 52
cities across the country.

00:28:17.310 --> 00:28:23.420
And then, so bringing up leaders
and encouraging other women,

00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.200
just to get a little
bit practical,

00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:29.100
what is the best
way for each of you,

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.455
personally, for somebody
to approach you with?

00:28:31.455 --> 00:28:33.091
Like, hi, can you be my mentor?

00:28:33.091 --> 00:28:34.090
That's not the best way.

00:28:34.090 --> 00:28:39.150
So what is the best way to enter
into a mentorship relationship?

00:28:39.150 --> 00:28:44.730
And what are the
tactics that you've

00:28:44.730 --> 00:28:47.980
used to reach out to someone
who inspires you that you

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.620
want to get some advice from?

00:28:49.620 --> 00:28:52.140
LUISA HERRMANN: The
secret is coffee.

00:28:52.140 --> 00:28:55.040
Buy me coffee, and I'll
be your mentor forever.

00:28:55.040 --> 00:28:56.190
No, but seriously.

00:28:56.190 --> 00:29:00.310
That actually has been a way
where I've engaged people

00:29:00.310 --> 00:29:02.310
that I wanted to talk to.

00:29:02.310 --> 00:29:05.100
Coffee works for dates, too.

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.100
But I'm not going there.

00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:09.690
But coffee is not
a big commitment.

00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:11.820
Let's grab coffee and
talk for a little bit.

00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:13.410
And then sometimes
those conversations

00:29:13.410 --> 00:29:15.029
are, literally,
just the 15 minutes.

00:29:15.029 --> 00:29:17.320
Sometimes they turn into hour
and a half conversations.

00:29:17.320 --> 00:29:19.130
So you never know.

00:29:19.130 --> 00:29:21.790
You never know if you'll click
with somebody to be your mentor

00:29:21.790 --> 00:29:23.680
until you actually try.

00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:26.350
So one of the things is try to
get a little bit of face time

00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:27.080
with that person.

00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:28.810
Say, do you have some time?

00:29:28.810 --> 00:29:30.750
I'm interested in--
and as Susan mentioned,

00:29:30.750 --> 00:29:32.292
people love talking
about themselves.

00:29:32.292 --> 00:29:33.916
People love talking
about what they do.

00:29:33.916 --> 00:29:35.740
So if you know a little
bit, and you ask--

00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.691
I saw that you did
this one thing.

00:29:37.691 --> 00:29:39.440
Can you talk a little
bit more about that?

00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.398
I'm interested in that.

00:29:40.398 --> 00:29:41.630
How can I get into it?

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:45.339
And the coffee is key, but
just get that conversation.

00:29:45.339 --> 00:29:46.380
Get those people talking.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.530
And usually you
will learn a lot.

00:29:48.530 --> 00:29:51.670
And then if they are interested
in what you're saying,

00:29:51.670 --> 00:29:53.890
they will also try to help you.

00:29:57.130 --> 00:30:02.370
SUSAN GOLD: To get
close to me, usually,

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:05.530
is volunteer doing
something that I'm really

00:30:05.530 --> 00:30:08.230
passionate about.

00:30:08.230 --> 00:30:10.660
So for my event,
the Global Game Jam,

00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:14.860
it happens in 93 countries
in over 630 locations.

00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:19.390
And if you say, oh, I was a
part of the Global Game Jam,

00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:21.480
then I'm more likely
to be like, oh, really?

00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:24.370
And then start to talk to
you because we have something

00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:27.670
in common, a common experience.

00:30:27.670 --> 00:30:30.610
Or if there is something
else that I'm doing,

00:30:30.610 --> 00:30:35.330
like I did a lot of stuff
with positive social impact,

00:30:35.330 --> 00:30:38.480
Games for Change, STEM
education, and things

00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:39.300
like that.

00:30:39.300 --> 00:30:42.810
Those are always to
get my attention.

00:30:42.810 --> 00:30:45.400
But the other way is
to play a game with me.

00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:46.510
I mean, I make games.

00:30:46.510 --> 00:30:47.630
I play games.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:52.460
And games are, as I was
talking to some people earlier,

00:30:52.460 --> 00:30:54.200
it's a universal language.

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:58.010
And once you play a game with
someone, you've created trust.

00:30:58.010 --> 00:31:02.830
You've created already--
oh, you didn't cheat.

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.620
You already know
something about someone

00:31:05.620 --> 00:31:06.840
when you play with them.

00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:10.680
And you get a real feeling for
who they are as an individual.

00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:13.031
If you play cards with
someone-- it doesn't even

00:31:13.031 --> 00:31:14.030
have to be a video game.

00:31:14.030 --> 00:31:14.779
It could be cards.

00:31:14.779 --> 00:31:15.980
It could be anything.

00:31:15.980 --> 00:31:17.690
And I just love to play.

00:31:17.690 --> 00:31:21.040
I think everybody loves to
play, but some more than others.

00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.950
But that's a real way of
creating a relationship

00:31:23.950 --> 00:31:24.650
with someone.

00:31:24.650 --> 00:31:26.790
Or introduce me to a new game.

00:31:26.790 --> 00:31:28.170
Oh, have you played this?

00:31:28.170 --> 00:31:30.450
And those things
get my attention.

00:31:30.450 --> 00:31:33.230
So yeah, it's about, if
you want my attention,

00:31:33.230 --> 00:31:35.430
it's gonna be about
what I'm interested in.

00:31:35.430 --> 00:31:37.010
So flag me.

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:39.550
Hey, look, me, I'm doing this.

00:31:39.550 --> 00:31:42.860
But also, if someone
comes up to me and says,

00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:44.230
I really love your passion.

00:31:44.230 --> 00:31:45.430
I love what you do.

00:31:45.430 --> 00:31:48.890
I have nothing to do with games,
but I just want to talk to you,

00:31:48.890 --> 00:31:51.410
I take those calls, too.

00:31:51.410 --> 00:31:53.300
And all they have to do
is write me an email.

00:31:53.300 --> 00:31:56.820
And it's not as if you
can't find any of us online.

00:31:56.820 --> 00:32:01.420
It's so easy, scarily easy.

00:32:01.420 --> 00:32:05.130
But the thing is that if
you want to talk to me,

00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:11.000
I will typically take
about an hour of my day

00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:13.310
to go through the
stuff that comes in

00:32:13.310 --> 00:32:15.290
that I don't know who it is.

00:32:15.290 --> 00:32:17.410
But usually, there's a
lot of stuff in there

00:32:17.410 --> 00:32:20.310
that I need to address,
like an e-mail.

00:32:20.310 --> 00:32:24.120
Do I want to be a
speaker at this event?

00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:25.570
Those are all
these I don't know.

00:32:25.570 --> 00:32:26.560
I put it in a file.

00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:28.380
I go back to it once a day.

00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:29.010
I check it out.

00:32:29.010 --> 00:32:30.260
I'm like, oh.

00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.700
I got an email from
someone from the FDA

00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.890
wanted to talk to me about
her passion for games.

00:32:35.890 --> 00:32:38.740
And I had no idea how
that worked with the FDA.

00:32:38.740 --> 00:32:40.570
But it was her
passion for games.

00:32:40.570 --> 00:32:42.240
And she worked at the FDA.

00:32:42.240 --> 00:32:45.160
And she started talking to
me about things she would

00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:47.380
like to see happen using games.

00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:50.280
And I was like, I'm
gonna help you do that.

00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.320
But that's all it took.

00:32:53.320 --> 00:32:55.196
And it was one e-mail.

00:32:55.196 --> 00:32:58.740
So I think you hit on
something that someone loves,

00:32:58.740 --> 00:33:02.075
and they're gonna jump on
it like a fish on a hook.

00:33:02.075 --> 00:33:03.200
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Awesome.

00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:03.740
Thank you.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.780
OK, so I got the
one-minute signal.

00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:07.730
So I really quickly
wanted to go by.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.660
So we've talked
about visibility,

00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:11.999
creating visibility for
yourself and others, community,

00:33:11.999 --> 00:33:13.790
being a part of community,
and giving back.

00:33:13.790 --> 00:33:17.870
And then, I want to hit on that
third Women Techmaker's focus,

00:33:17.870 --> 00:33:19.070
which is resources.

00:33:19.070 --> 00:33:22.250
You know, it's really great to
get all these minds together

00:33:22.250 --> 00:33:23.470
and share resources.

00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:28.910
So I'm gonna take a note from
my friend Saron Yitbarek's book.

00:33:28.910 --> 00:33:31.116
She runs a podcast
called CodeNewbies.

00:33:31.116 --> 00:33:32.990
And she does shout-outs
at these CodeNewbies.

00:33:32.990 --> 00:33:35.610
So I want you all to--
let's go down the line

00:33:35.610 --> 00:33:38.520
and shout out something
that-- whether it's a TED

00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:40.456
Talk that you think
everyone needs to see,

00:33:40.456 --> 00:33:42.330
a podcast that you listen
to, a book that you

00:33:42.330 --> 00:33:45.250
read that changed your life and
how you think about your work.

00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:46.910
Let's get your pens ready.

00:33:46.910 --> 00:33:49.440
We're gonna share
some resources.

00:33:49.440 --> 00:33:52.710
And mine, again, would
be CodeNewbies podcast.

00:33:52.710 --> 00:33:54.440
It's a really great
podcast-- interviews

00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:56.810
with a ton of great minds
in the technology industry.

00:33:56.810 --> 00:33:57.309
Parielle?

00:33:59.602 --> 00:34:01.435
PARIELLE LACY: I recommend
reading the news.

00:34:01.435 --> 00:34:03.091
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:03.091 --> 00:34:05.810
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Any
news sources in particular?

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:08.590
PARIELLE LACY: I particularly
enjoy "New York Times," NPR.

00:34:08.590 --> 00:34:14.500
I'd also recommend "Just Mercy,"
by Bryan Stevenson, a new book.

00:34:14.500 --> 00:34:19.199
Oh, and "The Seven Habits
of Highly Effective People."

00:34:19.199 --> 00:34:21.546
I do think that was actually
pretty effective for me.

00:34:21.546 --> 00:34:22.546
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Nice.

00:34:27.376 --> 00:34:31.050
LUISA HERRMANN: I read a
lot of very different books.

00:34:31.050 --> 00:34:33.047
I was going to
recommend one book.

00:34:33.047 --> 00:34:35.630
Well the last book that I read
was not related to this at all.

00:34:35.630 --> 00:34:36.285
It was called "The
[? Pilgrimmage." ?]

00:34:36.285 --> 00:34:37.334
It's very good.

00:34:37.334 --> 00:34:38.810
It's a thriller.

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:42.960
But I think for the purpose of
this panel, I would recommend--

00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:45.823
and we're at Google, I
realize-- but "Work Rules"

00:34:45.823 --> 00:34:48.730
by Laszlo Bock, for
those of you who know.

00:34:48.730 --> 00:34:51.210
It's a great book about
what motivates people.

00:34:51.210 --> 00:34:53.880
And I used to think
that there was somewhat

00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:56.445
at odds what a company
wants their employees to do

00:34:56.445 --> 00:34:57.862
and what the
employees want to do.

00:34:57.862 --> 00:34:59.153
And it turns out that it's not.

00:34:59.153 --> 00:35:00.790
And that book helped
me realize there's

00:35:00.790 --> 00:35:04.970
a lot you can get out of people
just by giving them autonomy

00:35:04.970 --> 00:35:07.090
and freedom to do
what they want,

00:35:07.090 --> 00:35:09.669
and what they think
is right, actually.

00:35:09.669 --> 00:35:10.710
SUSAN GOLD: Oh, whatever.

00:35:10.710 --> 00:35:14.020
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:16.610
This is my microphone.

00:35:16.610 --> 00:35:20.720
So for me, it's Audible.

00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:22.290
Like, I have no time.

00:35:22.290 --> 00:35:24.940
I have a full-time job,
and then I run a nonprofit.

00:35:24.940 --> 00:35:28.630
And you try to raise money, and
I try to create other projects.

00:35:28.630 --> 00:35:30.590
So I have no time
to sit and read.

00:35:30.590 --> 00:35:31.820
But I love reading.

00:35:31.820 --> 00:35:32.840
And I love fantasy.

00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:34.040
And I love all those things.

00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.690
And I can fold laundry
and listen to a book.

00:35:36.690 --> 00:35:39.740
But the one thing that that
Audible subscription provides

00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:43.130
you with besides that, which
is my ultimate life hack,

00:35:43.130 --> 00:35:46.290
is Monday through Friday
version of "The New York Times"

00:35:46.290 --> 00:35:47.010
Audible.

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.030
And so the whole from the time
I wake up, brush my teeth,

00:35:50.030 --> 00:35:52.350
and put on "The
New York Times," it

00:35:52.350 --> 00:35:54.160
reads you,
essentially, everything

00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.600
you need to know in
the day in 45 minutes.

00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:59.400
And that's how long it takes me
to get dressed in the morning.

00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:01.210
And I have a speaker
in my shower,

00:36:01.210 --> 00:36:03.680
so I have the
podcast in my shower.

00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:08.680
And then it's the NPR's, and
the 538s, and the science.

00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.770
And I'm a podcast fan.

00:36:12.770 --> 00:36:15.310
But that's because I
have so many things

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:22.400
I have to do that take up
your time-- walking the dog,

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.530
washing your clothes,
cooking dinner.

00:36:25.530 --> 00:36:28.800
That's time you can't
afford to waste, especially

00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:29.520
when you're busy.

00:36:29.520 --> 00:36:32.960
So take advantage of the fact
that there are all those tools

00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:36.964
out there, podcasts being
one of the greatest.

00:36:36.964 --> 00:36:39.380
VIDYA GANAPATI: OK, I'm gonna
recommend a book that I just

00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.390
read.

00:36:40.390 --> 00:36:41.710
It's called "Big Magic."

00:36:41.710 --> 00:36:43.570
And it's by Elizabeth Gilbert.

00:36:43.570 --> 00:36:48.330
And it's nominally for
writers and artists,

00:36:48.330 --> 00:36:51.950
but I feel it applies
very much to what

00:36:51.950 --> 00:36:56.165
we're doing with creating stuff
with technology and software.

00:36:56.165 --> 00:36:57.290
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Awesome.

00:36:57.290 --> 00:36:57.790
All right.

00:36:57.790 --> 00:36:59.580
So I think we have
time for questions.

00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:00.090
Yeah?

00:37:00.090 --> 00:37:00.920
Yeah, all right.

00:37:00.920 --> 00:37:02.060
So they have some mics.

00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:03.110
This is the fun part.

00:37:03.110 --> 00:37:04.985
Raise your hands high
if you have a question.

00:37:04.985 --> 00:37:06.731
Oh, there we go,
right in the back.

00:37:06.731 --> 00:37:08.700
AUDIENCE: What's your
favorite response

00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:12.050
to a man saying something
ignorant or sexist

00:37:12.050 --> 00:37:14.000
in a meeting or an event?

00:37:18.304 --> 00:37:20.095
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Take
it away, panelists.

00:37:20.095 --> 00:37:22.942
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:22.942 --> 00:37:25.570
SUSAN GOLD: So
there's two responses.

00:37:25.570 --> 00:37:27.240
Either slap them
upside the head.

00:37:27.240 --> 00:37:27.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:27.950 --> 00:37:30.160
Or say you didn't just
say that, did you?

00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:34.250
And then make them think about,
like, what did I just say?

00:37:34.250 --> 00:37:37.480
I mean, I have to say
that being in games,

00:37:37.480 --> 00:37:39.890
I feel like I'm with sailors.

00:37:39.890 --> 00:37:42.910
So it's a constant
barrage of things.

00:37:42.910 --> 00:37:45.150
And I learned to
filter a lot of it out.

00:37:45.150 --> 00:37:47.110
But on the occasions
when something's

00:37:47.110 --> 00:37:49.680
completely inappropriate,
I just call them out

00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.350
and make them realize
what they've done,

00:37:52.350 --> 00:37:54.315
and maybe think twice.

00:37:54.315 --> 00:37:56.940
LUISA HERRMANN: So that
used to happen to me a lot

00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:59.100
when I worked in manufacturing.

00:37:59.100 --> 00:38:01.770
I was the engineer responsible
for a lot of projects.

00:38:01.770 --> 00:38:03.800
And the vendors would
come in and say, hi, I'm

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:04.515
here to see the engineer.

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.162
Like, yep.

00:38:05.162 --> 00:38:06.800
Is he coming?

00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:10.210
Nope, she's here.

00:38:10.210 --> 00:38:13.180
And I used to laugh
and make light of it,

00:38:13.180 --> 00:38:14.710
like, ha ha, no, it's OK.

00:38:14.710 --> 00:38:15.730
It's not OK.

00:38:15.730 --> 00:38:16.782
And it's not funny.

00:38:16.782 --> 00:38:18.240
And so that's what
I stopped doing.

00:38:18.240 --> 00:38:19.573
I stopped thinking it was funny.

00:38:19.573 --> 00:38:21.670
I stopped giving these
people an easy out

00:38:21.670 --> 00:38:23.380
because if you make
them uncomfortable,

00:38:23.380 --> 00:38:26.835
they'll think twice
before they do it again.

00:38:26.835 --> 00:38:28.210
PARIELLE LACY: I
think a good way

00:38:28.210 --> 00:38:29.779
to make people
uncomfortable is just

00:38:29.779 --> 00:38:32.070
ask questions about the joke
until it's just, like, not

00:38:32.070 --> 00:38:32.570
funny.

00:38:32.570 --> 00:38:33.420
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:33.420 --> 00:38:35.378
Like, they say something,
and you're just like,

00:38:35.378 --> 00:38:36.790
what do you mean by that?

00:38:36.790 --> 00:38:38.180
But that's not always true.

00:38:38.180 --> 00:38:39.680
And then just keep
asking questions.

00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.310
They're just like,
it's just a joke.

00:38:41.310 --> 00:38:42.476
And then they get all upset.

00:38:42.476 --> 00:38:44.361
And you're just like,
oh, it's not funny.

00:38:44.361 --> 00:38:45.303
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:51.066
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: All right.

00:38:51.066 --> 00:38:52.930
Another mic right here.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:54.156
Right here.

00:38:54.156 --> 00:38:55.908
It's coming.

00:38:55.908 --> 00:38:57.090
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:57.090 --> 00:38:59.950
Can you each, or wherever it
applies, talk about, maybe,

00:38:59.950 --> 00:39:03.680
a situation where you've
almost reached an impossible

00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:06.510
obstacle in your career with
maybe a horrible manager

00:39:06.510 --> 00:39:11.100
or a situation, and what tools
you used to have self-control

00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:13.970
and learn from the situation?

00:39:13.970 --> 00:39:17.724
Hypothetically-- I'm not
experiencing it at all.

00:39:17.724 --> 00:39:19.290
CORINNE WARNSHUIS:
I'll just really

00:39:19.290 --> 00:39:20.939
quickly say that I
really liked what

00:39:20.939 --> 00:39:23.480
Sarah was saying this morning
about disarming with curiosity.

00:39:23.480 --> 00:39:25.470
I think that that's
helped me recently.

00:39:25.470 --> 00:39:29.081
If somebody is, kind of, coming
up against you, just say,

00:39:29.081 --> 00:39:30.830
well, the facts don't
really support that.

00:39:30.830 --> 00:39:32.590
So I'm unclear what you mean.

00:39:32.590 --> 00:39:35.540
Can you tell me more
about that issue

00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:39.410
or whatever you're coming to the
table with I don't understand.

00:39:39.410 --> 00:39:40.886
That was helpful for me.

00:39:40.886 --> 00:39:42.750
VIDYA GANAPATI: So
actually, I recently

00:39:42.750 --> 00:39:48.960
had an experience
and not hypothetical.

00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.760
What I did was
actually very similar.

00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:52.950
I just kept calm.

00:39:52.950 --> 00:39:55.710
And I just kept on
asking questions.

00:39:55.710 --> 00:39:58.950
And I kept on asking
questions until, finally,

00:39:58.950 --> 00:40:01.550
the other person realized
that they actually

00:40:01.550 --> 00:40:02.860
had nothing to stand upon.

00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:05.440
And at the end, I was like,
OK, so what are we taking away

00:40:05.440 --> 00:40:06.830
from this discussion?

00:40:06.830 --> 00:40:11.940
And he was like, I guess
we're all good then.

00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:14.770
So I basically started
off with somebody

00:40:14.770 --> 00:40:16.960
being very unhappy
with my performance,

00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.999
and then realizing they
had absolutely nothing

00:40:18.999 --> 00:40:19.790
to be unhappy with.

00:40:19.790 --> 00:40:23.360
So, yeah, just keep
calm and ask questions.

00:40:23.360 --> 00:40:24.720
Questions are your best tool.

00:40:29.201 --> 00:40:30.492
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Anyone else?

00:40:30.492 --> 00:40:30.928
No?

00:40:30.928 --> 00:40:32.820
LUISA HERRMANN: I would
say, and this is something

00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:34.700
that I've taken for
life, just figure out

00:40:34.700 --> 00:40:36.090
what you can learn from it.

00:40:36.090 --> 00:40:37.990
Think about it as, it's hard.

00:40:37.990 --> 00:40:38.940
It's uncomfortable.

00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:39.610
It's unpleasant.

00:40:39.610 --> 00:40:44.449
But let it make you less
uncomfortable in the future.

00:40:44.449 --> 00:40:45.490
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: Right.

00:40:45.490 --> 00:40:47.560
Sometimes the most
difficult situations

00:40:47.560 --> 00:40:50.250
are the ones where
you learn the most.

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:52.906
Does anybody else have any other
questions for our panelists?

00:40:52.906 --> 00:40:54.030
Here we go right over here.

00:40:57.790 --> 00:41:02.140
AUDIENCE: So I recently
went to Hack@Brown, along

00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:06.750
with some other fellow
Brown University grads.

00:41:06.750 --> 00:41:10.610
And they had little jars
that you could put tokens in.

00:41:10.610 --> 00:41:16.300
And they were going to donate
some money to an organization.

00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:19.660
And three out of four
of the organizations

00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:24.510
were about encouraging
women to code.

00:41:24.510 --> 00:41:27.520
And we've got Girls
Who Code, Black Girls

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:32.930
Who Code, Girl Develop It--
16 different organizations,

00:41:32.930 --> 00:41:33.700
at least.

00:41:33.700 --> 00:41:36.710
How can we all work together?

00:41:36.710 --> 00:41:38.640
I realize that these
different organizations

00:41:38.640 --> 00:41:41.462
have different goals
and different people

00:41:41.462 --> 00:41:42.420
that they're targeting.

00:41:42.420 --> 00:41:47.540
But how can we work
together to make

00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.842
an impact that's bigger
than the sum of the whole?

00:41:51.842 --> 00:41:53.300
CORINNE WARNSHUIS:
Yeah, I actually

00:41:53.300 --> 00:41:54.910
think that's a great question.

00:41:54.910 --> 00:41:58.060
And before I came into
this space as a student,

00:41:58.060 --> 00:42:01.431
actually, with Girl Develop It,
I thought, oh, yeah, there's

00:42:01.431 --> 00:42:01.930
so many.

00:42:01.930 --> 00:42:04.022
Why don't they all
just come together

00:42:04.022 --> 00:42:05.730
and have one big
organization that serves

00:42:05.730 --> 00:42:07.170
all of these different needs?

00:42:07.170 --> 00:42:09.945
But actually, I found that
the more specific and the more

00:42:09.945 --> 00:42:12.070
focused that these groups
are, the better that they

00:42:12.070 --> 00:42:14.767
can serve the population
that they're trying to serve.

00:42:14.767 --> 00:42:16.350
I mean, I'll speak
for Girl Develop it

00:42:16.350 --> 00:42:19.670
because I am the executive
director of that organization.

00:42:19.670 --> 00:42:22.250
And we really focus on
adult women, 18 and up.

00:42:22.250 --> 00:42:25.070
And we really have found that
that space is something that

00:42:25.070 --> 00:42:27.950
isn't really being focused on.

00:42:27.950 --> 00:42:30.210
We're trying to help and
support the women who

00:42:30.210 --> 00:42:34.270
missed the traditional
CS education who just

00:42:34.270 --> 00:42:36.902
have been left out of
technology education

00:42:36.902 --> 00:42:37.860
throughout their lives.

00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.354
But an organization
like Girls Who Code,

00:42:40.354 --> 00:42:42.270
they're really doing
something very different,

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:45.030
which is teaching girls
so that they might know

00:42:45.030 --> 00:42:47.320
that computer
science is a career

00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:49.690
or that it's a path
that they can take.

00:42:49.690 --> 00:42:51.202
So we wouldn't even
see those people

00:42:51.202 --> 00:42:52.660
because they would
likely have gone

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.800
on to do computer science
or something like that

00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.920
or something related.

00:42:56.920 --> 00:43:00.920
And it's really
about just making

00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.920
people more aware of the issue.

00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.700
I think when I was
in seventh grade,

00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.450
my first entry to
web development

00:43:08.450 --> 00:43:10.502
was I built a website
on ancient Egypt

00:43:10.502 --> 00:43:11.710
and won a trip to Disneyland.

00:43:11.710 --> 00:43:13.001
And that was really fun for me.

00:43:13.001 --> 00:43:14.930
That was something
that really excited me.

00:43:14.930 --> 00:43:18.470
But then I just did it as a
hobby in high school and HTML

00:43:18.470 --> 00:43:20.830
and made my MySpace look pretty.

00:43:20.830 --> 00:43:24.310
And I never even knew that
computer science was a thing.

00:43:24.310 --> 00:43:26.540
I think girls in high school,
girls in middle school

00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.040
today know it's a thing.

00:43:28.040 --> 00:43:30.720
They hear about it because of
these great groups and clubs

00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:33.910
that are around the country
and around the world.

00:43:33.910 --> 00:43:37.000
And really, we're
focusing on the people

00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.210
who might have missed
the boat and who

00:43:40.210 --> 00:43:42.460
could really benefit from
having some technical skill.

00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:45.550
I met a student here
today who is not

00:43:45.550 --> 00:43:47.524
trying to become a
developer or a programmer.

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:48.940
She just wants to
be able to speak

00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.780
with her team in a technical way
and understand her team better.

00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:54.990
So there's just so many
different kind of paths

00:43:54.990 --> 00:43:59.680
that we're catching women
to give them opportunities

00:43:59.680 --> 00:44:01.235
in this very technical world.

00:44:01.235 --> 00:44:02.370
That's my take on it.

00:44:04.657 --> 00:44:06.740
I guess that question was
probably directed at me,

00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:07.225
but if you want to go ahead.

00:44:07.225 --> 00:44:09.660
SUSAN GOLD: Well I would
have to say there's

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:12.730
a reason why niches are there.

00:44:12.730 --> 00:44:17.800
And it's because people
can't feel comfortable

00:44:17.800 --> 00:44:19.620
in every space.

00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:21.480
And it's just like
personalities.

00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:23.370
Not everything fits everyone.

00:44:23.370 --> 00:44:29.130
So although they share many
common traits or end goals,

00:44:29.130 --> 00:44:31.760
how they achieve them are
always gonna be different.

00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.520
And you have to adapt
for each and every one

00:44:34.520 --> 00:44:36.540
of those segments.

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:39.030
CORINNE WARNSHUIS: OK.

00:44:39.030 --> 00:44:40.020
Any final questions?

00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:42.580
Probably have time for one more.

00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.331
All right we've told you
everything we can tell you.

00:44:45.331 --> 00:44:45.830
Awesome.

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:46.410
Thank you so much.

00:44:46.410 --> 00:44:47.010
Thank you.

00:44:47.010 --> 00:44:47.926
SUSAN GOLD: Thank you.

00:44:47.926 --> 00:44:50.150
[APPLAUSE]

00:44:50.150 --> 00:44:52.300
