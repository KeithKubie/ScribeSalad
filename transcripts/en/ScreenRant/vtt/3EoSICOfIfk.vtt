If there's one thing kids love, it's TV shows
aimed directly at their age group. Whether

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:14.950
it's tales of transforming robots straight
from Japan, or mystical creatures living in

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:18.470
their own back yards, the show's we watch
as kids tend to be remembered as some of the

00:00:18.470 --> 00:00:23.520
best we ever witnessed. But maybe they actually
were. So for studios looking to turn nostalgia

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:27.369
into box office dollars, they should at least
be turning to the right ones. Here are Screen

00:00:27.369 --> 00:00:32.000
Rant's 10 Amazing Kids TV Shows That Would
Make Awesome Movies.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.260
M.A.S.K.
In a world where former toy lines like Transformers

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.000
and G.I. Joe can become large-scale movies,
why wouldn't a movie mixing the best of both

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.690
worlds work even more? Especially with some
Mission: Impossible thrown in just to be safe.

00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:50.489
The operatives of M.A.S.K. - the Mobile Armored
Strike Kommand - rely on superpowered masks,

00:00:50.489 --> 00:00:54.850
transforming cars, and space age technology
to keep the evil forces of VENOM at bay. Since

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.879
there isn't much beyond those plot points
that would need to be adapted, there's no

00:00:57.879 --> 00:01:02.280
reason why the right writers couldn't make
a M.A.S.K. story worth telling.

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:05.780
Gargoyles
When an ancient team of Gargoyles - noble

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:10.080
warriors who turn to stone during the day
- are lifted from a Scottish castle all the

00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:14.160
way to New York City, it's the ultimate fish
out of water story... except the fish are

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.030
ancient winged creatures eager to explore
the modern world. It didn't take long for

00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.080
the cartoon to become a massive hit, and its
themes and stories are already dark enough

00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.540
to appeal to an older audience. There's no
doubt about it: a big screen take on Goliath

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:31.150
and his Gargoyles couldn't just work - it's
a hit in the making.

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:34.510
Voltron
This one's an easy sell: a team of five people

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:39.690
all pilot massive robot lions that, when combined
together, form a towering robotic wwarrior

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:43.580
known as Voltron: Defender of the Universe.
You shouldn't really need any more reasons

00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:47.910
why this would work, since kids didn't when
the cartoon first made it to American homes.

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:52.110
Despite being written and acted in Japanese,
and deciphered without a translator, the lions

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:56.150
were cool enough to make Voltron the most
successful syndicated kids' show of its time.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:02:01.910
So if the time right for a Power Rangers reboot,
Voltron can't be too far behind.

00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:03.800
Thundercats
What could be better to a kid than hearing

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:08.670
they might one day wake up in a full-grown,
heroic body, ready to do battle like a cartoon

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:12.470
hero? That's the main plot of ThunderCats,
when Lion-O and his group of friends travel

00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:16.469
from their doomed planet to Third Earth, arriving
and waking from stasis to find that they're

00:02:16.469 --> 00:02:20.890
now full-grown. The villain, enemies, and
larger mythology of the Eye of Thundera all

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:25.150
make it an even better story, but considering
the show's place in pop culture, nobody needs

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:28.230
any convincing.
Power Rangers

00:02:28.230 --> 00:02:32.500
It's one thing to be chosen to become a martial
artist superhero, but given a robotic animal

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:37.060
to pilot on top of it? The Power Rangers are
the kings of kids cartoon heroes, recruited

00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:41.180
to battle the galaxy's worst villains just
for being "teenagers with attitude." It's

00:02:41.180 --> 00:02:45.080
hard to know what the real hook of the show
actually is: the teens transformed into neon-colored

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:48.549
ninja warriors, or when they're forced to
combine their individual vehicles into the

00:02:48.549 --> 00:02:53.120
epic Megazord to take on an oversized enemy.
It's easy to see why a Power Rangers movie

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:57.060
is actually in production, but the filmmakers
still need to capture the spirit, while keeping

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.030
it cool for more than just diehard fans - easier
said than done.

00:03:01.030 --> 00:03:03.739
Samurai Jack
It's honestly surprising that this series

00:03:03.739 --> 00:03:07.840
hasn't already been adapted to live-action,
since its unique story and inspired premise

00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:11.829
basically demand it. When the title Samurai
has completed the training needed to defeat

00:03:11.829 --> 00:03:16.439
the evil Demon Aku, his enemy pulls a fast
one, sending the samurai far into the future,

00:03:16.439 --> 00:03:20.150
buying himself enough time to prepare for
his attack. Dropped into a technologically

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.860
advanced, but fascist and dystopic society,
Samurai Jack must find the way home to keep

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.519
this world ruled by Aku from ever existing,
as Aku sends wave after wave of killers and

00:03:29.519 --> 00:03:33.709
light-hearted hitmen to take him out. Time
travel, samurai, demons - what more could

00:03:33.709 --> 00:03:37.029
you want?
Biker Mice From Mars

00:03:37.029 --> 00:03:40.760
It may be the most far-fetched premise on
our entire list, but trust us: the story of

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:44.430
three mice-men from Mars who protect Earth
from the evil that destroyed their home planet

00:03:44.430 --> 00:03:48.819
- from the backs of customized motorcycles
- is one worth seeing adapted. The fact that

00:03:48.819 --> 00:03:52.829
they're actually mice men could be hard to
swallow, but the story of three grease monkey

00:03:52.829 --> 00:03:56.519
aliens could give fans of the Teenage Mutant
Ninja Turtles another franchise to root for

00:03:56.519 --> 00:04:01.480
- and give the Biker Mice a modern reboot
to learn from.

00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:04.639
SilverHawks
We've got shows in space, and shows following

00:04:04.639 --> 00:04:09.329
cops - but what about a cartoon series following
futuristic cops with metallic wings? That's

00:04:09.329 --> 00:04:12.980
right, the SilverHawks may not be the most
original idea for a kids' show, but it's hard

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.750
to argue with just how cool they are. The
show was a spiritual successor to ThunderCats

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:20.061
in several ways, so assuming that the same
connection could be translated to the big

00:04:20.061 --> 00:04:25.810
screen (with a big enough budget to do their
winged crimefighting justice), especially

00:04:25.810 --> 00:04:27.720
in the rage of the "shared universe" at all
cost...

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:32.379
C.O.P.S.
To be clear, we men's the cartoon series Cops,

00:04:32.379 --> 00:04:36.770
not the prime time cop series. No, we're referring
to the Central Organization of Police Specialist.

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:41.730
In other words, a team of the very best law
men and women from across America, all recruited

00:04:41.730 --> 00:04:46.180
to stop Big Boss from taking over Empire City.
Did we mention their leader was almost killed

00:04:46.180 --> 00:04:50.919
by Big Boss, and had his Torso replaced with
cybernetic parts? If the idea of a Robocop

00:04:50.919 --> 00:04:55.930
team-up aimed at kids doesn't get your hopes
for a great action comedy soaring, ghats your

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:58.550
own fault.
Dungeons &amp; Dragons

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.259
Ask any fan of role playing games, or D&amp;D
in particular, and they'll tell you that as

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.900
cool as it is to step into the shoes of a
monster or witch hunter, just&nbsp;playing&nbsp;as

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:11.110
one doesn't even come close. Thanks to this
animated series, kids could dream that they,

00:05:11.110 --> 00:05:14.949
too would plunge into the distant world of
Never Land, only to wake up having been shrunk

00:05:14.949 --> 00:05:19.150
down into a forest-sized game of chess, and
having the mysterious Dungeon Master assign

00:05:19.150 --> 00:05:22.979
them their skills. In other words, in a world
where lines between video games and all other

00:05:22.979 --> 00:05:31.530
entertainment are starting to blur, seeing
a group of kids have to deal with 

00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:36.990
that revelation.
