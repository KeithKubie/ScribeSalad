00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Okay, so the correct answer is for the title,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we're going to use a string.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
For the art, we're also going to use a string,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
and for the created, we're also going--we're going to use a date time.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now, actually I lied to you,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
we're not going to use a string, we're going to use something called text,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
but there is no way for me to ask a quiz without giving away the answer.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
I learned while writing this that there is

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000
another type called text,

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:28.000
and the difference between a string and a text

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
is that a string must be under 500 characters

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000
and can be indexed.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Text can be greater than 500 characters,

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
which is really handy for ASCII art.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
ASCII art that is under 500 characters is not very fun at all.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000
I actually learned this while building this lesson,

00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and text cannot be indexed,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
which means of course that we can't sort based on a text property.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
This is fine, you know in our case, we're going to

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.000
sort probably on the created property

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
so we can show things in order.

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000
We won't be able to sort things by the artwork,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
which is fine, because what would that even mean?

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000
So if we were to use the string data type,

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000
which we're going to use on our titles, yeah it is indexed so you can do queries,

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000
you can say get me the artwork to title = X.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000
You can't--we can't do a query get me the art where text = X

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000
because it's not indexed.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:26.000
Let's go ahead and define our data type.
