00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:04.590
Are you serving the right
image to your user's device?

00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:08.090
With the srcset attribute, you
can specify a different image

00:00:08.090 --> 00:00:11.640
file for 1x and 2x displays.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:14.650
The srcset attribute takes
a comma separated list

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:17.110
of image declarations,
which consists

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:21.150
of a URL string followed by an
image resolution-- for example,

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:23.500
1x or 2x.

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:25.980
The image resolution
information is also

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:28.590
used to scale the
image so that it always

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.180
appears at the right size.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:33.050
When you use
srcset, don't forget

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:36.280
to specify a fallback image
with the src attribute

00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:39.820
so that older browsers
always get an image.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:42.520
Start using srcset today.
