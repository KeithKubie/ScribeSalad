Iran to do quietly secretly yes they

00:00:41.819 --> 00:00:41.829
Iran to do quietly secretly yes they
 

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:43.890
Iran to do quietly secretly yes they
have in they've enriched uranium to 3%

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:43.900
have in they've enriched uranium to 3%
 

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:45.780
have in they've enriched uranium to 3%
or 4% whatever the number is that is

00:00:45.780 --> 00:00:45.790
or 4% whatever the number is that is
 

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:49.020
or 4% whatever the number is that is
useful for as fuel to then enrich it to

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:49.030
useful for as fuel to then enrich it to
 

00:00:49.030 --> 00:00:50.759
useful for as fuel to then enrich it to
90 whatever percent they would have to I

00:00:50.759 --> 00:00:50.769
90 whatever percent they would have to I
 

00:00:50.769 --> 00:00:52.170
90 whatever percent they would have to I
mean it would have to be done under the

00:00:52.170 --> 00:00:52.180
mean it would have to be done under the
 

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.420
mean it would have to be done under the
watchful eyes of the IAEA so we would

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:54.430
watchful eyes of the IAEA so we would
 

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:56.310
watchful eyes of the IAEA so we would
know about it the minute they do it it's

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:56.320
know about it the minute they do it it's
 

00:00:56.320 --> 00:00:57.570
know about it the minute they do it it's
not like they have this other secret

00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:57.580
not like they have this other secret
 

00:00:57.580 --> 00:00:59.820
not like they have this other secret
facility or at least even the IAEA

00:00:59.820 --> 00:00:59.830
facility or at least even the IAEA
 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:00.929
facility or at least even the IAEA
doesn't think they have the secret

00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:00.939
doesn't think they have the secret
 

00:01:00.939 --> 00:01:02.250
doesn't think they have the secret
facility where they're doing exactly

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:02.260
facility where they're doing exactly
 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:03.539
facility where they're doing exactly
what they're doing in front of the IAEA

00:01:03.539 --> 00:01:03.549
what they're doing in front of the IAEA
 

00:01:03.549 --> 00:01:05.429
what they're doing in front of the IAEA
and they can then secretly go out and

00:01:05.429 --> 00:01:05.439
and they can then secretly go out and
 

00:01:05.439 --> 00:01:08.760
and they can then secretly go out and
and enrich to a higher level some even

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:08.770
and enrich to a higher level some even
 

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:09.780
and enrich to a higher level some even
once you've enriched it to a higher

00:01:09.780 --> 00:01:09.790
once you've enriched it to a higher
 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:12.359
once you've enriched it to a higher
level surely you'd want to test a

00:01:12.359 --> 00:01:12.369
level surely you'd want to test a
 

00:01:12.369 --> 00:01:13.800
level surely you'd want to test a
nuclear weapon before you just fired it

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:13.810
nuclear weapon before you just fired it
 

00:01:13.810 --> 00:01:15.510
nuclear weapon before you just fired it
off I mean it Ron is so far away from

00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:15.520
off I mean it Ron is so far away from
 

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.950
off I mean it Ron is so far away from
testing a nuclear weapon so we would

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:16.960
testing a nuclear weapon so we would
 

00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:18.870
testing a nuclear weapon so we would
even know in the North Koreans tested

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:18.880
even know in the North Koreans tested
 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:20.010
even know in the North Koreans tested
weapons we don't we're not even sure

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:20.020
weapons we don't we're not even sure
 

00:01:20.020 --> 00:01:23.280
weapons we don't we're not even sure
that they worked we do know that Israel

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:23.290
that they worked we do know that Israel
 

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.990
that they worked we do know that Israel
has nuclear weapons we do know they have

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.000
has nuclear weapons we do know they have
 

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:26.490
has nuclear weapons we do know they have
a delivery system for those nuclear

00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:26.500
a delivery system for those nuclear
 

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:27.899
a delivery system for those nuclear
weapons they have them kinds of missiles

00:01:27.899 --> 00:01:27.909
weapons they have them kinds of missiles
 

00:01:27.909 --> 00:01:29.399
weapons they have them kinds of missiles
that could deliver accurate missiles

00:01:29.399 --> 00:01:29.409
that could deliver accurate missiles
 

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.440
that could deliver accurate missiles
that could deliver a nuclear weapon to

00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:31.450
that could deliver a nuclear weapon to
 

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.560

that ability I mean some would say oh

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:37.120
that ability I mean some would say oh
 

00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:38.940
that ability I mean some would say oh
you're being you know naive they could

00:01:38.940 --> 00:01:38.950
you're being you know naive they could
 

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.200
you're being you know naive they could
do it in a year they could do it in two

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:40.210
do it in a year they could do it in two
 

00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:42.719
do it in a year they could do it in two
years but to be so many signals before

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729
years but to be so many signals before
 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.149
years but to be so many signals before
that happened that we could get we could

00:01:45.149 --> 00:01:45.159
that happened that we could get we could
 

00:01:45.159 --> 00:01:47.130
that happened that we could get we could
become really alarmed if Iran suddenly

00:01:47.130 --> 00:01:47.140
become really alarmed if Iran suddenly
 

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.440
become really alarmed if Iran suddenly
shuts down the IAEA cameras 24 hours a

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:49.450
shuts down the IAEA cameras 24 hours a
 

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.240
shuts down the IAEA cameras 24 hours a
day on their facility where it's using

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:51.250
day on their facility where it's using
 

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:52.469

nutrition you're right they shut down

00:01:52.469 --> 00:01:52.479
nutrition you're right they shut down
 

00:01:52.479 --> 00:01:53.850
nutrition you're right they shut down
those cameras you can say okay that's

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:53.860
those cameras you can say okay that's
 

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:56.430
those cameras you can say okay that's
the beginning of a cause of alarm what

00:01:56.430 --> 00:01:56.440
the beginning of a cause of alarm what
 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:57.780
the beginning of a cause of alarm what
are they doing that they want to get rid

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:57.790
are they doing that they want to get rid
 

00:01:57.790 --> 00:01:59.910
are they doing that they want to get rid
of the IAEA inspectors so I mean we're

00:01:59.910 --> 00:01:59.920
of the IAEA inspectors so I mean we're
 

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:01.800
of the IAEA inspectors so I mean we're
so far away from that I think that we

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:01.810
so far away from that I think that we
 

00:02:01.810 --> 00:02:03.600
so far away from that I think that we
should let the IAEA do their job we

00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:03.610
should let the IAEA do their job we
 

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:06.060
should let the IAEA do their job we
should at least talk to the Iranians I

00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:06.070
should at least talk to the Iranians I
 

00:02:06.070 --> 00:02:07.590
should at least talk to the Iranians I
mean the thing is that when they have

00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:07.600
mean the thing is that when they have
 

00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:09.300
mean the thing is that when they have
the technology to enrich uranium

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:09.310
the technology to enrich uranium
 

00:02:09.310 --> 00:02:10.919
the technology to enrich uranium
you're not going to bomb that technology

00:02:10.919 --> 00:02:10.929
you're not going to bomb that technology
 

00:02:10.929 --> 00:02:12.930
you're not going to bomb that technology
out of them there's plenty of people in

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:12.940
out of them there's plenty of people in
 

00:02:12.940 --> 00:02:15.059
out of them there's plenty of people in
Iran who can start up a centrifuge

00:02:15.059 --> 00:02:15.069
Iran who can start up a centrifuge
 

00:02:15.069 --> 00:02:16.860
Iran who can start up a centrifuge
program even if this program was

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:16.870
program even if this program was
 

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:19.380
program even if this program was
completely eliminated so the question

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:19.390
completely eliminated so the question
 

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:21.149
completely eliminated so the question
now becomes how do we incentivize the

00:02:21.149 --> 00:02:21.159
now becomes how do we incentivize the
 

00:02:21.159 --> 00:02:23.489
now becomes how do we incentivize the
Iranians to never take that step we know

00:02:23.489 --> 00:02:23.499
Iranians to never take that step we know
 

00:02:23.499 --> 00:02:25.979
Iranians to never take that step we know
that they have the knowledge to build

00:02:25.979 --> 00:02:25.989
that they have the knowledge to build
 

00:02:25.989 --> 00:02:28.929
that they have the knowledge to build
centrifuges to enrich uranium and a lot

00:02:28.929 --> 00:02:28.939
centrifuges to enrich uranium and a lot
 

00:02:28.939 --> 00:02:30.309
centrifuges to enrich uranium and a lot
of people analysts will tell you nuclear

00:02:30.309 --> 00:02:30.319
of people analysts will tell you nuclear
 

00:02:30.319 --> 00:02:31.869
of people analysts will tell you nuclear
sciences will say it's not a big step to

00:02:31.869 --> 00:02:31.879
sciences will say it's not a big step to
 

00:02:31.879 --> 00:02:34.270
sciences will say it's not a big step to
then go to a bomb it is actually a

00:02:34.270 --> 00:02:34.280
then go to a bomb it is actually a
 

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:36.429
then go to a bomb it is actually a
bigger step than we think because you

00:02:36.429 --> 00:02:36.439
bigger step than we think because you
 

00:02:36.439 --> 00:02:38.140
bigger step than we think because you
have to test it you have to create that

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.150
have to test it you have to create that
 

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:39.339
have to test it you have to create that
perfect sphere you have to have the

00:02:39.339 --> 00:02:39.349
perfect sphere you have to have the
 

00:02:39.349 --> 00:02:41.110
perfect sphere you have to have the
mechanism after the delivery system to

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:41.120
mechanism after the delivery system to
 

00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:43.750
mechanism after the delivery system to
deliver it presumably you want a second

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:43.760
deliver it presumably you want a second
 

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:45.160
deliver it presumably you want a second
strike capability not just a first

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:45.170
strike capability not just a first
 

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:46.599
strike capability not just a first
strike capability because the first

00:02:46.599 --> 00:02:46.609
strike capability because the first
 

00:02:46.609 --> 00:02:48.160
strike capability because the first
strike capability and somebody has a

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:48.170
strike capability and somebody has a
 

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:50.410
strike capability and somebody has a
second strike on you you're done so you

00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:50.420
second strike on you you're done so you
 

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:53.860
second strike on you you're done so you
want to have this that to be unequal in

00:02:53.860 --> 00:02:53.870
want to have this that to be unequal in
 

00:02:53.870 --> 00:02:56.140
want to have this that to be unequal in
terms of nuclear power with Israel for

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:56.150
terms of nuclear power with Israel for
 

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:59.470
terms of nuclear power with Israel for
example so how do we incentivize them to

00:02:59.470 --> 00:02:59.480
example so how do we incentivize them to
 

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.179
example so how do we incentivize them to
not take that step and that's where

00:03:01.179 --> 00:03:01.189
not take that step and that's where
 

00:03:01.189 --> 00:03:02.890
not take that step and that's where
negotiations come in because there are

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
negotiations come in because there are
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.089
negotiations come in because there are
plenty of countries that do have that

00:03:04.089 --> 00:03:04.099
plenty of countries that do have that
 

00:03:04.099 --> 00:03:06.159
plenty of countries that do have that
ability Japan is one there never

00:03:06.159 --> 00:03:06.169
ability Japan is one there never
 

00:03:06.169 --> 00:03:07.599
ability Japan is one there never
incentivized to go and build a bomb

00:03:07.599 --> 00:03:07.609
incentivized to go and build a bomb

Brazil South Africa these are countries

00:03:09.729 --> 00:03:09.739
Brazil South Africa these are countries
 

00:03:09.739 --> 00:03:11.559
Brazil South Africa these are countries
that have the ability to enrich uranium

00:03:11.559 --> 00:03:11.569
that have the ability to enrich uranium
 

00:03:11.569 --> 00:03:13.929
that have the ability to enrich uranium
have the ability to even probably build

00:03:13.929 --> 00:03:13.939
have the ability to even probably build
 

00:03:13.939 --> 00:03:16.059
have the ability to even probably build
