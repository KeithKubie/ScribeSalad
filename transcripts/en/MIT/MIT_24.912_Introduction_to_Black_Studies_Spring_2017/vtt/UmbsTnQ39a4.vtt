00:00:22.956 --> 00:00:26.326
AUDIENCE: I think with
the past election--

00:00:26.426 --> 00:00:29.429
so Donald Trump is, obviously,
one of the 1%, right?

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.932
So why do you think there's
such different views on

00:00:33.033 --> 00:00:35.402
whether or not he's
representative of America,

00:00:35.502 --> 00:00:37.704
whether being the American
dream or being or being one

00:00:37.804 --> 00:00:39.973
of the "crooks" in the top 1%?

00:00:40.073 --> 00:00:43.576
NOAM CHOMSKY: For one
thing, there's no America.

00:00:43.676 --> 00:00:46.079
There's many splits.

00:00:46.179 --> 00:00:49.049
And some of the splits
are quite sharp.

00:00:49.149 --> 00:00:55.922
In fact, this country has become
polarized in the last 50 years

00:00:56.022 --> 00:00:59.492
to an extent that's
never happened before.

00:00:59.592 --> 00:01:01.761
In fact, just take a look at
the two political parties.

00:01:04.464 --> 00:01:12.839
Up until the 1960s, the parties
weren't all that different.

00:01:12.939 --> 00:01:15.975
You couldn't distinguish
a moderate Republican

00:01:16.076 --> 00:01:17.577
from a liberal democrat.

00:01:17.676 --> 00:01:21.047
They're more or less alike.

00:01:21.146 --> 00:01:26.453
By now, the parties are so
differentiated that literally

00:01:26.553 --> 00:01:29.889
people don't intermarry
across parties.

00:01:29.989 --> 00:01:31.825
And it's become--
literally, there

00:01:31.925 --> 00:01:34.094
are some good studies of it.

00:01:34.194 --> 00:01:38.965
And what actually happened
is it's connected with race.

00:01:39.065 --> 00:01:42.435
Up until the 1960s,
the Democrats

00:01:42.535 --> 00:01:47.440
were kind of a coalition
of Southern Democrats,

00:01:47.539 --> 00:01:50.810
all extreme racists,
and people who

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:54.314
were very powerful because
they stayed in office forever

00:01:54.414 --> 00:01:58.283
since the South was
a one-party region.

00:01:58.384 --> 00:02:00.787
Take a look at "The New
York Times" this morning.

00:02:00.887 --> 00:02:03.389
There's a headline
about one-party Alabama.

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:06.593
Everybody is a Republican,
as if that's something new.

00:02:06.693 --> 00:02:09.162
That goes back to the
Civil War, except now they

00:02:09.262 --> 00:02:10.229
call them Republicans.

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.332
They used to call
them Democrats.

00:02:12.432 --> 00:02:15.502
But same system, basically.

00:02:15.602 --> 00:02:18.838
But the Southern Democrats
were extremely powerful

00:02:18.938 --> 00:02:22.408
because the senators
had senior positions.

00:02:22.509 --> 00:02:24.544
They'd been there forever.

00:02:24.644 --> 00:02:26.045
There was a big block.

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:29.749
They had a big effect
on legislation.

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:32.252
So if you look at the
New Deal legislation,

00:02:32.352 --> 00:02:33.686
there was a lot of progress.

00:02:33.786 --> 00:02:35.954
But it was straight racist.

00:02:36.055 --> 00:02:38.725
So Social Security, for example.

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.994
The Southern Democrats
were willing to permit

00:02:41.094 --> 00:02:44.998
it to go through as long
as it excluded blacks.

00:02:45.098 --> 00:02:46.099
And it did.

00:02:46.199 --> 00:02:49.435
So Social Security was
designed to exclude

00:02:49.536 --> 00:02:53.039
the majority of the workforce,
agricultural and domestic

00:02:53.139 --> 00:02:53.906
workers.

00:02:54.007 --> 00:02:56.576
Namely, African Americans.

00:02:56.676 --> 00:02:59.879
The GI Bill gave--

00:02:59.978 --> 00:03:01.414
it was a segregated army.

00:03:01.514 --> 00:03:04.851
So it didn't go to blacks.

00:03:04.951 --> 00:03:07.654
All the way through,
the Southern Democrats

00:03:07.754 --> 00:03:11.391
were willing to tolerate
reformist measures

00:03:11.491 --> 00:03:17.897
as long as it maintained the
Southern system of deep racism.

00:03:17.997 --> 00:03:24.304
And what amounted to
new kinds of slavery.

00:03:24.404 --> 00:03:28.041
Well, what happened in the
1960s was the civil rights

00:03:28.141 --> 00:03:30.176
movement broke through this.

00:03:30.276 --> 00:03:36.082
The Democrats began to pick
up civil rights legislation.

00:03:36.182 --> 00:03:38.851
And the Southern Democrats
simply pulled out.

00:03:38.952 --> 00:03:42.255
That's Nixon's famous
Southern strategy,

00:03:42.355 --> 00:03:46.960
let's appeal to the South and
turn them into Republicans

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:49.395
on straight racist grounds.

00:03:49.495 --> 00:03:51.497
So the parties realigned.

00:03:51.598 --> 00:03:54.100
And a large part
of rural America

00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.702
went along with it, too.

00:03:55.802 --> 00:03:58.404
That's quite separate
from urban America.

00:03:58.504 --> 00:04:02.742
The lines became sharper during
the neoliberal years, when

00:04:02.842 --> 00:04:04.644
rural America was just smashed.

00:04:04.744 --> 00:04:08.514
Rural America meant working
class, industrial America.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:11.951
Small towns with those
industries and so on.

00:04:12.051 --> 00:04:14.120
That was all smashed.

00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:17.390
Urban America, that's
where the 1% is.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.292
That's where we come from--

00:04:19.392 --> 00:04:23.062
the people who prosper, the
more educated, and so on.

00:04:23.162 --> 00:04:25.798
So these splits became
extremely sharp.

00:04:28.501 --> 00:04:32.572
It's increased with new media.

00:04:32.672 --> 00:04:37.043
So the cable television,
social media, and so on.

00:04:37.143 --> 00:04:40.413
One of their effects is
to intensify the split.

00:04:40.513 --> 00:04:49.956
So one part of America lives
in talk radio and Fox News.

00:04:50.056 --> 00:04:52.659
I don't know if you
listen to talk radio here,

00:04:52.759 --> 00:04:54.193
but you should.

00:04:54.294 --> 00:04:56.262
I often listen to
it when I'm driving.

00:04:56.362 --> 00:04:57.964
It's very interesting.

00:04:58.064 --> 00:05:01.367
And what's interesting is not
Rush Limbaugh and those guys.

00:05:01.467 --> 00:05:02.602
They're predictable.

00:05:02.702 --> 00:05:05.738
But the people who call
in are what's interesting.

00:05:05.838 --> 00:05:09.342
And that's a slice of Boston.

00:05:09.442 --> 00:05:11.444
We're not talking
about Mississippi.

00:05:11.544 --> 00:05:13.313
We're talking about Boston.

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:18.718
It's a slice of Boston which
is in some other universe.

00:05:18.818 --> 00:05:20.553
The things they
believe, the things they

00:05:20.653 --> 00:05:22.889
hear, the things they read.

00:05:22.989 --> 00:05:26.459
That's why, I forget
the exact number.

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:30.463
But maybe half-- some large
percentage of Republicans

00:05:30.563 --> 00:05:33.366
think that Obama is a
Muslim and that he wasn't

00:05:33.466 --> 00:05:35.068
born in the United States.

00:05:35.168 --> 00:05:37.503
You hear that drummed into
your head all the time.

00:05:37.603 --> 00:05:38.871
OK.

00:05:38.971 --> 00:05:43.042
And of course, the hatred of
Obama was substantially racist.

00:05:43.142 --> 00:05:48.247
I mean, why is the Affordable
Care Act called Obamacare

00:05:48.348 --> 00:05:50.582
by Democrats, by liberals?

00:05:50.683 --> 00:05:53.753
Was Medicare called Johnsoncare?

00:05:53.853 --> 00:05:54.821
Of course not.

00:05:54.921 --> 00:05:56.456
We just accept the racism.

00:05:56.556 --> 00:05:58.491
It's part of us.

00:05:58.591 --> 00:06:00.593
So sure, it's Obamacare.

00:06:00.693 --> 00:06:02.762
This black guy
pushed it through.

00:06:02.862 --> 00:06:05.832
And that's liberal
Democrats call it that.

00:06:05.932 --> 00:06:07.834
We don't even think about it.

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:10.370
But it's because it's
all deeply ingrained.

00:06:10.470 --> 00:06:13.039
And when you get to
parts of the culture

00:06:13.139 --> 00:06:15.808
where that's all they hear--

00:06:15.908 --> 00:06:19.545
talk radio, Rush Limbaugh,
Loren McLaughlin,

00:06:19.645 --> 00:06:20.747
or whatever her name is.

00:06:20.847 --> 00:06:24.617
You really have to hear
this stuff to believe it.

00:06:24.717 --> 00:06:30.890
And for large parts of
rural, lower middle-class,

00:06:30.990 --> 00:06:33.893
small businessmen, the kind
of people who vote for Trump,

00:06:33.993 --> 00:06:35.728
that's what they live with.

00:06:35.828 --> 00:06:38.731
And by now, with
the reconstruction

00:06:38.831 --> 00:06:40.633
of the political parties--

00:06:40.733 --> 00:06:42.969
the Republicans are
an interesting party.

00:06:43.069 --> 00:06:49.142
They are slavishly dedicated to
the welfare of the super-rich

00:06:49.242 --> 00:06:51.244
and the corporations.

00:06:51.344 --> 00:06:53.379
Take a look at their
legislative programs.

00:06:53.479 --> 00:06:56.149
Paul Ryan is the
extreme example.

00:06:56.249 --> 00:06:59.552
The most savage, brutal
programs you can think of.

00:06:59.652 --> 00:07:02.922
So that's the actual
Republican Party.

00:07:03.022 --> 00:07:04.690
But their constituency
is people who are

00:07:04.791 --> 00:07:05.992
being harmed by these programs.

00:07:11.164 --> 00:07:14.467
It's the kind of paradox
that Arlie Hochschild

00:07:14.567 --> 00:07:16.335
wanted to understand.

00:07:16.436 --> 00:07:20.206
And I think when you read
through what she found,

00:07:20.306 --> 00:07:21.674
you can understand it.

00:07:21.774 --> 00:07:25.978
But even true of things
like environmental issues.

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:29.916
So in the Bayou area where
she was working and living,

00:07:30.016 --> 00:07:32.552
there's an extremely
high rate of cancer.

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:35.021
In fact, it's
called Cancer Alley.

00:07:35.121 --> 00:07:38.090
And the reasons for it are
the petrochemical corporations

00:07:38.191 --> 00:07:42.728
who just pour poisonous
chemicals into the Bayou.

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.931
And these are people who
live in the environment.

00:07:45.031 --> 00:07:45.531
They hunt.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:48.301
They fish.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:50.303
Quite apart from the
fact that their children

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:52.505
are dying of cancer.

00:07:52.605 --> 00:07:55.207
These people are
environmentalists.

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:58.878
And the people they
vote for are the ones

00:07:58.978 --> 00:08:01.347
who want to destroy the EPA.

00:08:01.447 --> 00:08:04.984
And when you look into it, it
turns out there's a reason.

00:08:05.084 --> 00:08:08.988
For them, what the
EPA means is some guy

00:08:09.088 --> 00:08:12.291
in a suit who comes from
Washington and tells us,

00:08:12.391 --> 00:08:14.427
you can't fish here.

00:08:14.527 --> 00:08:16.162
That's the EPA.

00:08:16.262 --> 00:08:19.432
But that guy does nothing
about the petrochemical plants.

00:08:19.532 --> 00:08:23.903
So why shouldn't they want
to get rid of the EPA?

00:08:24.003 --> 00:08:26.772
That's their lives.

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:30.109
That's the kind of lives
that these people are living.

00:08:30.209 --> 00:08:36.482
And when you see it firsthand--
and even you can see it right

00:08:36.582 --> 00:08:37.850
here if you want to--

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.919
you can understand
the attitudes.

00:08:40.019 --> 00:08:44.090
They're not as
paradoxical as they sound.

00:08:44.190 --> 00:08:47.493
It's leading to a very strange
situation in the country.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:50.263
Very dangerous one.

00:08:50.363 --> 00:08:54.367
Incidentally, most
of the Trump voters

00:08:54.467 --> 00:08:56.869
were not working class and poor.

00:08:56.969 --> 00:08:59.772
They're mostly kind of lower
middle-class or very rich.

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:01.774
Those two groups.

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:05.111
But there were working
people who voted for Trump,

00:09:05.211 --> 00:09:09.181
or who voted for
Scott Brown here.

00:09:09.282 --> 00:09:13.052
And many of those
people voted for Obama.

00:09:13.152 --> 00:09:18.724
They believed his rhetoric
about hope and change.

00:09:18.824 --> 00:09:23.062
And when they saw very quickly
that hope and change means

00:09:23.162 --> 00:09:26.432
money for bankers
and nothing for us,

00:09:26.532 --> 00:09:29.101
they became deeply
disillusioned.

00:09:29.201 --> 00:09:34.073
And so they're now trusting
the word of a con man who

00:09:34.173 --> 00:09:37.276
also says hope and change.

00:09:37.376 --> 00:09:39.979
But it's not that different
from the 2008 election

00:09:40.079 --> 00:09:42.582
in some respects.

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:43.983
Just a different con man.

00:09:50.156 --> 00:09:51.490
AUDIENCE: How do
you think we could

00:09:51.591 --> 00:09:56.495
go about trying to change
the attitudes of like, what

00:09:56.596 --> 00:09:58.431
people think that the EPA does?

00:09:58.531 --> 00:10:00.099
Or like, that idea
of being in a line?

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:03.302
How do you think we
could change that?

00:10:03.402 --> 00:10:06.038
NOAM CHOMSKY: By
interacting with people.

00:10:06.138 --> 00:10:07.206
It's the only way.

00:10:07.306 --> 00:10:11.210
That's what organizing
and activism are about.

00:10:11.310 --> 00:10:16.749
You have to be in touch with the
people who have these beliefs.

00:10:16.849 --> 00:10:20.586
Sympathetically, figure out--
come to understand why they

00:10:20.686 --> 00:10:24.123
have the beliefs and interact--

00:10:24.223 --> 00:10:25.224
show them.

00:10:25.324 --> 00:10:28.094
Try to lead them to
understand that there's

00:10:28.194 --> 00:10:30.029
another way of looking at it.

00:10:30.129 --> 00:10:31.864
That's what education is about.

00:10:31.964 --> 00:10:34.433
That's what organizing is about.

00:10:34.533 --> 00:10:35.701
You can do it right in Boston.

00:10:40.573 --> 00:10:43.509
That's why activists
live in communities,

00:10:43.609 --> 00:10:45.044
work with communities.

00:10:48.047 --> 00:10:49.915
MICHEL DEGRAFF: Any
questions on that side?

00:10:55.388 --> 00:10:57.857
AUDIENCE: Speaking to
what we've been discussing

00:10:57.957 --> 00:11:00.493
these last few minutes,
I think there's

00:11:00.593 --> 00:11:02.762
a tendency in a lot of--

00:11:02.862 --> 00:11:05.831
not only in politics,
but just in general

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:08.634
to not be as willing to try and
understand the point of view

00:11:08.734 --> 00:11:12.738
of somebody who opposes you.

00:11:12.838 --> 00:11:15.007
I don't know-- speaking
now to politics

00:11:15.107 --> 00:11:17.810
specifically-- if that's
something that's kind of arisen

00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:21.180
the last couple decades,
or that has some sort

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.715
of historical precedence.

00:11:22.815 --> 00:11:24.216
And given the
polarization I've seen

00:11:24.316 --> 00:11:29.055
in media that's now trickling
into various political

00:11:29.155 --> 00:11:33.793
constituencies, have you
seen any similar effects

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:37.496
in any, maybe historical
elections or any sort

00:11:37.596 --> 00:11:39.298
of prior settings?

00:11:39.398 --> 00:11:43.335
NOAM CHOMSKY: This inability
to hear the other person?

00:11:43.436 --> 00:11:45.271
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:11:45.371 --> 00:11:47.840
NOAM CHOMSKY: Sometimes, it
takes really extreme forms.

00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:49.508
Take Clinton.

00:11:49.608 --> 00:11:52.078
I think maybe the low
point of the last election

00:11:52.178 --> 00:11:56.382
was her mocking of
the deplorables, which

00:11:56.482 --> 00:11:59.218
had a big effect.

00:11:59.318 --> 00:12:05.624
Here is this rich,
elite woman who goes--

00:12:05.725 --> 00:12:08.027
talks to Wall Street.

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:10.896
Gets huge honoraria talking
to Wall Street bankers.

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:13.566
She's calling us deplorable.

00:12:13.666 --> 00:12:14.900
Why are we deplorable?

00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:20.106
We're hardworking and honest,
religious, conservative,

00:12:20.206 --> 00:12:21.173
traditional people.

00:12:21.273 --> 00:12:23.142
What makes us deplorable?

00:12:23.242 --> 00:12:26.612
But that's an extreme
example of what

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:28.914
we see around us all the time.

00:12:29.014 --> 00:12:32.918
This contempt for the,
say, Trump voters.

00:12:33.018 --> 00:12:34.186
How can they be so stupid?

00:12:34.286 --> 00:12:36.555
How can they be so ridiculous?

00:12:36.655 --> 00:12:37.823
They're not humans.

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:41.694
And they feel the same way
towards the people walking

00:12:41.794 --> 00:12:44.964
around Harvard Square.

00:12:45.064 --> 00:12:47.566
There's plenty of
that all the back.

00:12:47.665 --> 00:12:50.035
Like Benjamin Franklin
saying we shouldn't

00:12:50.136 --> 00:12:52.271
admit Swedes and Germans.

00:12:52.371 --> 00:12:53.739
Not very different.
