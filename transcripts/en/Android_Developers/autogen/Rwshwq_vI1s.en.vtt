once you've learned the basics of

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
once you've learned the basics of
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:25.910
once you've learned the basics of
operating system you want to learn the

operating system you want to learn the
 

00:01:25.920 --> 00:01:27.260
operating system you want to learn the
fancier things like maybe how to

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:27.270
fancier things like maybe how to

and so that's the kind of stuff that we

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
and so that's the kind of stuff that we
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:32.060
and so that's the kind of stuff that we
cover and we're really trying to help

00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:32.070
cover and we're really trying to help
 

00:01:32.070 --> 00:01:34.580
cover and we're really trying to help
you build not just a simple sample app

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
you build not just a simple sample app
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:35.810
you build not just a simple sample app
but like just walk you through how

00:01:35.810 --> 00:01:35.820
but like just walk you through how
 

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.910
but like just walk you through how
something works in its entirety and when

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:37.920
something works in its entirety and when
 

00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.200
something works in its entirety and when
you have to go back and iterate on the

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:39.210
you have to go back and iterate on the
 

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:40.370
you have to go back and iterate on the
same app that you've already finished

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:40.380
same app that you've already finished
 

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.480
same app that you've already finished
we're trying to get more into that

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:41.490
we're trying to get more into that
 

00:01:41.490 --> 00:01:44.030
we're trying to get more into that
developer experience when we're teaching

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
developer experience when we're teaching
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.100
developer experience when we're teaching
and so that it feels more true to what

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:46.110
and so that it feels more true to what
 

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.749
and so that it feels more true to what
your your life isn't your experience is

00:01:47.749 --> 00:01:47.759
your your life isn't your experience is
 

00:01:47.759 --> 00:01:50.420
your your life isn't your experience is
going to be and then if it helps I

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:50.430
going to be and then if it helps I
 

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:52.190
going to be and then if it helps I
actually started learning Android last

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:52.200
actually started learning Android last
 

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:54.950
actually started learning Android last
February 2014 and so I just want to say

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:54.960
February 2014 and so I just want to say
 

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:56.840
February 2014 and so I just want to say
that as like a point of hopefully like

00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:56.850
that as like a point of hopefully like
 

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:58.399
that as like a point of hopefully like
comfort you don't have to have been

00:01:58.399 --> 00:01:58.409
comfort you don't have to have been
 

00:01:58.409 --> 00:01:59.480
comfort you don't have to have been
doing this since the beginning and you

00:01:59.480 --> 00:01:59.490
doing this since the beginning and you
 

00:01:59.490 --> 00:02:00.350
doing this since the beginning and you
don't have to been doing this for a very

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
don't have to been doing this for a very
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:02.090
don't have to been doing this for a very
long time to really pick it up and like

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:02.100
long time to really pick it up and like
 

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:03.800
long time to really pick it up and like
run with it because it does change every

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:03.810
run with it because it does change every
 

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.880
run with it because it does change every
year and you can really get caught up

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:04.890
year and you can really get caught up
 

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:07.520
year and you can really get caught up
quickly okay so maybe listen to me but

00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:07.530
quickly okay so maybe listen to me but
 

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:10.010
quickly okay so maybe listen to me but
if you don't that's okay so today the

00:02:10.010 --> 00:02:10.020
if you don't that's okay so today the
 

00:02:10.020 --> 00:02:11.420
if you don't that's okay so today the
reason we are all in this room is

00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:11.430
reason we are all in this room is
 

00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.180
reason we are all in this room is
because battery

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:13.190
because battery
 

00:02:13.190 --> 00:02:14.860
because battery
actually matters almost more than

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:14.870
actually matters almost more than
 

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.350
actually matters almost more than
anything else that we have and there has

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:17.360
anything else that we have and there has
 

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.360
anything else that we have and there has
been tons of press on this you see

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.370
been tons of press on this you see
 

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:21.220
been tons of press on this you see
studies all the time comparing this

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:21.230
studies all the time comparing this
 

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:22.690
studies all the time comparing this
device to that device which one runs

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:22.700
device to that device which one runs
 

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.460
device to that device which one runs
better or this carrier to that carrier

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
better or this carrier to that carrier
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:25.840
better or this carrier to that carrier
this one's clearly better for battery

00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:25.850
this one's clearly better for battery
 

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:28.420
this one's clearly better for battery
doesn't burn your radio or you know buy

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.430
doesn't burn your radio or you know buy
 

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.490
doesn't burn your radio or you know buy
this new thing because this tablet will

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:30.500
this new thing because this tablet will
 

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.410
this new thing because this tablet will
last all month and this other one will

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:32.420
last all month and this other one will
 

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:34.600
last all month and this other one will
only last a couple of days and everybody

00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:34.610
only last a couple of days and everybody
 

00:02:34.610 --> 00:02:36.220
only last a couple of days and everybody
really cares about getting power but

00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:36.230
really cares about getting power but
 

00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:38.530
really cares about getting power but
nobody wants to give up using and so

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:38.540
nobody wants to give up using and so
 

00:02:38.540 --> 00:02:39.880
nobody wants to give up using and so
it's kind of a trade-off and this is

00:02:39.880 --> 00:02:39.890
it's kind of a trade-off and this is
 

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:41.320
it's kind of a trade-off and this is
this big problem for users that

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:41.330
this big problem for users that
 

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:45.910
this big problem for users that
everyone's trying to solve so what we're

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:45.920
everyone's trying to solve so what we're
 

00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:47.140
everyone's trying to solve so what we're
going to talk about is how to solve this

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:47.150
going to talk about is how to solve this
 

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:48.880
going to talk about is how to solve this
by not making it worse with background

00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:48.890
by not making it worse with background
 

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:51.550
by not making it worse with background
tasks and so clearly you know how this

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:51.560
tasks and so clearly you know how this
 

00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.050
tasks and so clearly you know how this
works you've got your activity kicks off

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.060
works you've got your activity kicks off
 

00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:54.280
works you've got your activity kicks off
at background tasks your activity

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:54.290
at background tasks your activity
 

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:56.650
at background tasks your activity
continues this is good for users because

00:02:56.650 --> 00:02:56.660
continues this is good for users because
 

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:58.180
continues this is good for users because
you're not hanging up on the frame rate

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
you're not hanging up on the frame rate
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.670
you're not hanging up on the frame rate
but this is bad for is the it's the

00:03:00.670 --> 00:03:00.680
but this is bad for is the it's the
 

00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.990
but this is bad for is the it's the
device because we get into this

00:03:01.990 --> 00:03:02.000
device because we get into this
 

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.060

at some point and it doesn't really

at some point and it doesn't really
 

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:15.520

because all of these things if you can't

because all of these things if you can't
 

00:03:20.959 --> 00:03:22.930
because all of these things if you can't
coalesce them you can't optimize for

coalesce them you can't optimize for

community so you would think we'd have a

but we don't we only have one we just
want to preserve the battery life

00:04:38.350 --> 00:04:38.360
want to preserve the battery life
 

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.330
want to preserve the battery life
because by doing that we're creating a

because by doing that we're creating a
 

00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:43.120
because by doing that we're creating a
better user experience and that's what

00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:43.130
better user experience and that's what
 

00:04:43.130 --> 00:04:44.710
better user experience and that's what
everyone like when you're creating an

deleting them because we're in idle mode

and I know that this sounds kind of
 

00:06:56.919 --> 00:06:59.080
and I know that this sounds kind of
frustrating and kind of scary because as

you're the state that your app is gonna

so let's talk about how we get into doze

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:20.990
so let's talk about how we get into doze
 

00:07:20.990 --> 00:07:23.650
so let's talk about how we get into doze
mode doze mode is triggered when the

00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:23.660
mode doze mode is triggered when the
 

00:07:23.660 --> 00:07:25.960
mode doze mode is triggered when the
device is not charging and the screen is

00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:25.970
device is not charging and the screen is
 

00:07:25.970 --> 00:07:27.700
device is not charging and the screen is
off and the device has not moved in a

long while so what that looks like with
 

00:07:29.960 --> 00:07:32.379
long while so what that looks like with
your phone I put it down I kind of walk

back over there I better still be at 58%
I'm going to be really frustrated if I

I'm going to be really frustrated if I
 

00:07:40.849 --> 00:07:42.339
I'm going to be really frustrated if I
get back here at the end of this hour

00:07:42.339 --> 00:07:42.349

we're actually going to step into it

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:04.250
we're actually going to step into it

this is a timeline of what does looks

this is a timeline of what does looks
 

00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:09.310
this is a timeline of what does looks
like we start with like everything that

was required to get into doze and then
 

00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:12.730
was required to get into doze and then
you'll see that doze actually will give

00:08:12.730 --> 00:08:12.740
you'll see that doze actually will give
 

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:13.839
you'll see that doze actually will give
itself some maintenance window so we'll

those maintenance windows that's
 

00:09:40.820 --> 00:09:42.400
those maintenance windows that's
measured by idle mean it's about and we

00:09:42.400 --> 00:09:42.410
measured by idle mean it's about and we
 

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:44.650
measured by idle mean it's about and we
also have like a sensing in a locating

00:09:44.650 --> 00:09:44.660
also have like a sensing in a locating
 

00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:45.610
also have like a sensing in a locating
mode and if you want to know more about

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:45.620
mode and if you want to know more about
 

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:47.590
mode and if you want to know more about
those you can actually go look them up

00:09:47.590 --> 00:09:47.600
those you can actually go look them up
 

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:49.300
those you can actually go look them up
in the documentation they just serve

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:49.310
in the documentation they just serve
 

00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:52.090

with getting to these states so if you

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:52.100
with getting to these states so if you
 

00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:53.470
with getting to these states so if you
go back to look at our picture you'll

00:09:53.470 --> 00:09:53.480
go back to look at our picture you'll
 

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:55.570
go back to look at our picture you'll
see that we've moved it through all of

00:09:55.570 --> 00:09:55.580
see that we've moved it through all of
 

00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:56.920
see that we've moved it through all of
these states with all of our constant

00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:56.930
these states with all of our constant
 

00:09:56.930 --> 00:09:59.410
these states with all of our constant
checks and we have gotten to the point

00:09:59.410 --> 00:09:59.420
checks and we have gotten to the point
 

00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:01.150
checks and we have gotten to the point
where okay yeah we were sensing not

00:10:01.150 --> 00:10:01.160
where okay yeah we were sensing not
 

00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.550
where okay yeah we were sensing not
sensing locating not locating but we're

00:10:03.550 --> 00:10:03.560
sensing locating not locating but we're
 

00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:05.050
sensing locating not locating but we're
still inactive we've gotten to idle and

00:10:05.050 --> 00:10:05.060
still inactive we've gotten to idle and
 

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:07.690
still inactive we've gotten to idle and
so idle maintenance these other windows

00:10:07.690 --> 00:10:07.700
so idle maintenance these other windows
 

00:10:07.700 --> 00:10:10.150
so idle maintenance these other windows
is actually where we step out of doze

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:10.160
is actually where we step out of doze
 

00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:12.250
is actually where we step out of doze

want to be out of date when the user
 

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.920
want to be out of date when the user
comes back right and so what we're going

00:10:14.920 --> 00:10:14.930
comes back right and so what we're going
 

00:10:14.930 --> 00:10:17.590
comes back right and so what we're going
to do is we're going to every so often

00:10:17.590 --> 00:10:17.600
to do is we're going to every so often
 

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:20.050
to do is we're going to every so often
in the idle period we'll just you know

this is clearing because it's our goal
we got to maintenance window now we get

00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:29.510
we got to maintenance window now we get
 

00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:31.060
we got to maintenance window now we get

lets you access other tools by name and
then you've got device idle and this is

00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:42.480
then you've got device idle and this is
 

00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:44.809
then you've got device idle and this is
a new service that was introduced so

00:11:44.809 --> 00:11:44.819
a new service that was introduced so
 

00:11:44.819 --> 00:11:46.999
a new service that was introduced so
that you could manage the device idle

00:11:46.999 --> 00:11:47.009
that you could manage the device idle
 

00:11:47.009 --> 00:11:49.100
that you could manage the device idle
controller and then obviously step will

00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:49.110
controller and then obviously step will
 

00:11:49.110 --> 00:11:51.049
controller and then obviously step will
let you do those steps and H will show

00:11:51.049 --> 00:11:51.059
let you do those steps and H will show
 

00:11:51.059 --> 00:11:54.350
let you do those steps and H will show
you all the other options you have and

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:54.360
you all the other options you have and
 

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.569
you all the other options you have and
then the other key to testing is you

00:11:56.569 --> 00:11:56.579
then the other key to testing is you
 

00:11:56.579 --> 00:11:58.129
then the other key to testing is you
need to indicate that the device has to

00:11:58.129 --> 00:11:58.139
need to indicate that the device has to
 

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.539
need to indicate that the device has to
be unplugged most likely when you're

00:11:59.539 --> 00:11:59.549
be unplugged most likely when you're
 

00:11:59.549 --> 00:12:00.889
be unplugged most likely when you're
testing and running a TV can see your

plugged in your phone to the computer
 

00:12:03.029 --> 00:12:04.220
plugged in your phone to the computer
and now you're charging so you have to

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:04.230
and now you're charging so you have to
 

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:06.829
and now you're charging so you have to
like cancel that but when you're

00:12:06.829 --> 00:12:06.839
like cancel that but when you're
 

00:12:06.839 --> 00:12:07.910
like cancel that but when you're
stepping through and you're testing your

00:12:07.910 --> 00:12:07.920
stepping through and you're testing your
 

00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.179
stepping through and you're testing your
device all you're seeing here is like

00:12:10.179 --> 00:12:10.189
device all you're seeing here is like
 

00:12:10.189 --> 00:12:12.829
device all you're seeing here is like
whether or not you're surprised by

whether or not you're surprised by
 

00:12:12.839 --> 00:12:15.199
whether or not you're surprised by
anything whether or not that pause has

anything whether or not that pause has
 

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:16.519
anything whether or not that pause has
actually broken a part of your app

00:12:16.519 --> 00:12:16.529
actually broken a part of your app
 

00:12:16.529 --> 00:12:19.519
actually broken a part of your app
behavior and the idea here when we when

00:12:19.519 --> 00:12:19.529
behavior and the idea here when we when
 

00:12:19.529 --> 00:12:21.199
behavior and the idea here when we when
we created this is that it shouldn't

00:12:21.199 --> 00:12:21.209
we created this is that it shouldn't
 

00:12:21.209 --> 00:12:23.809
we created this is that it shouldn't
because everything is on hold

00:12:23.809 --> 00:12:23.819
because everything is on hold
 

00:12:23.819 --> 00:12:25.609
because everything is on hold
everything's been pauses not anywhere

00:12:25.609 --> 00:12:25.619
everything's been pauses not anywhere
 

00:12:25.619 --> 00:12:27.590
everything's been pauses not anywhere
near their phone and yet you're getting

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:27.600
near their phone and yet you're getting
 

00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:29.780
near their phone and yet you're getting
a chance to still update any potential

00:12:29.780 --> 00:12:29.790
a chance to still update any potential
 

00:12:29.790 --> 00:12:33.739
a chance to still update any potential
content so now the question is how do we

00:12:33.739 --> 00:12:33.749
content so now the question is how do we
 

00:12:33.749 --> 00:12:35.989
content so now the question is how do we
get out of doze mode and like what what

00:12:35.989 --> 00:12:35.999
get out of doze mode and like what what
 

00:12:35.999 --> 00:12:39.199
get out of doze mode and like what what
does it really mean when we've called it

00:12:39.199 --> 00:12:39.209
does it really mean when we've called it
 

00:12:39.209 --> 00:12:41.030
does it really mean when we've called it
quits and like we're done so the clear

00:12:41.030 --> 00:12:41.040
quits and like we're done so the clear
 

00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.159
quits and like we're done so the clear
one here is if the dice is plugged in we

00:12:43.159 --> 00:12:43.169
one here is if the dice is plugged in we
 

00:12:43.169 --> 00:12:45.590
one here is if the dice is plugged in we
don't care anymore about whether or not

00:12:45.590 --> 00:12:45.600
don't care anymore about whether or not
 

00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.329
don't care anymore about whether or not
we're preserving battery because we're

00:12:47.329 --> 00:12:47.339
we're preserving battery because we're
 

00:12:47.339 --> 00:12:50.119
we're preserving battery because we're
charging or if the dice is picked up I'm

00:12:50.119 --> 00:12:50.129

so bad at slides then the users clearly

00:12:52.789 --> 00:12:52.799
so bad at slides then the users clearly
 

00:12:52.799 --> 00:12:54.859
so bad at slides then the users clearly
interested in using it again the other

00:12:54.859 --> 00:12:54.869
interested in using it again the other
 

00:12:54.869 --> 00:12:56.479
interested in using it again the other
thing though is that if there's an alarm

00:12:56.479 --> 00:12:56.489
thing though is that if there's an alarm
 

00:12:56.489 --> 00:12:58.039
thing though is that if there's an alarm
and not an alarm in a driller but like

00:12:58.039 --> 00:12:58.049
and not an alarm in a driller but like
 

00:12:58.049 --> 00:13:00.889
and not an alarm in a driller but like
an alarm like an alarm clock then we're

00:13:00.889 --> 00:13:00.899
an alarm like an alarm clock then we're
 

00:13:00.899 --> 00:13:02.419
an alarm like an alarm clock then we're
going to exit doze mode well before that

00:13:02.419 --> 00:13:02.429
going to exit doze mode well before that
 

00:13:02.429 --> 00:13:03.769
going to exit doze mode well before that
so everyone has a chance to sink before

00:13:03.769 --> 00:13:03.779
so everyone has a chance to sink before
 

00:13:03.779 --> 00:13:05.509
so everyone has a chance to sink before
that user wakes up from their nap right

00:13:05.509 --> 00:13:05.519
that user wakes up from their nap right
 

00:13:05.519 --> 00:13:07.819
that user wakes up from their nap right
like that's a really key thing here so

00:13:07.819 --> 00:13:07.829
like that's a really key thing here so
 

00:13:07.829 --> 00:13:10.039
like that's a really key thing here so
we've built this entire system with one

00:13:10.039 --> 00:13:10.049
we've built this entire system with one
 

00:13:10.049 --> 00:13:11.890
we've built this entire system with one
goal of preserving the battery life

00:13:11.890 --> 00:13:11.900
goal of preserving the battery life
 

00:13:11.900 --> 00:13:14.110
goal of preserving the battery life
and then we built it around making a

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:14.120
and then we built it around making a
 

00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:15.550
and then we built it around making a
great user experience so they never know

00:13:15.550 --> 00:13:15.560
great user experience so they never know
 

00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.470
great user experience so they never know
that their device was idle all they know

00:13:17.470 --> 00:13:17.480
that their device was idle all they know
 

00:13:17.480 --> 00:13:19.060
that their device was idle all they know
is that they were gone for two days

00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:19.070
is that they were gone for two days
 

00:13:19.070 --> 00:13:20.320
is that they were gone for two days
because they were hanging out their

00:13:20.320 --> 00:13:20.330
because they were hanging out their
 

00:13:20.330 --> 00:13:21.640
because they were hanging out their
friends and going camping and they came

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:21.650
friends and going camping and they came
 

00:13:21.650 --> 00:13:23.800
friends and going camping and they came
back and their tablet still works they

00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:23.810
back and their tablet still works they
 

00:13:23.810 --> 00:13:24.910
back and their tablet still works they
pick it up everything's great and the

00:13:24.910 --> 00:13:24.920
pick it up everything's great and the
 

00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:26.470
pick it up everything's great and the
tablets still charge like it didn't die

00:13:26.470 --> 00:13:26.480
tablets still charge like it didn't die
 

00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:28.720
tablets still charge like it didn't die
and that's a phenomenal experience and

00:13:28.720 --> 00:13:28.730
and that's a phenomenal experience and
 

00:13:28.730 --> 00:13:30.190
and that's a phenomenal experience and
if we can nail that we're gonna really

00:13:30.190 --> 00:13:30.200
if we can nail that we're gonna really
 

00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:32.800
if we can nail that we're gonna really
really make it so that everything just

00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:32.810
really make it so that everything just
 

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.360
really make it so that everything just
is great and it also means that your app

00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:34.370
is great and it also means that your app
 

00:13:34.370 --> 00:13:35.860
is great and it also means that your app
is no longer to blame in the battery

00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:35.870
is no longer to blame in the battery
 

00:13:35.870 --> 00:13:36.760
is no longer to blame in the battery
list and they come back and they're

00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:36.770
list and they come back and they're
 

00:13:36.770 --> 00:13:37.960
list and they come back and they're
their thing is dead and like why you

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:37.970
their thing is dead and like why you
 

00:13:37.970 --> 00:13:39.460
their thing is dead and like why you
know why was the news running if I

00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:39.470
know why was the news running if I
 

00:13:39.470 --> 00:13:40.720
know why was the news running if I
wasn't even here to read it like that

00:13:40.720 --> 00:13:40.730
wasn't even here to read it like that
 

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.010
wasn't even here to read it like that
doesn't make any sense to me

00:13:42.010 --> 00:13:42.020
doesn't make any sense to me
 

00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.860
doesn't make any sense to me
so hopefully you don't have to do

00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:44.870
so hopefully you don't have to do
 

00:13:44.870 --> 00:13:46.270
so hopefully you don't have to do
anything you tested your app once make

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:46.280
anything you tested your app once make
 

00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.740
anything you tested your app once make
sure like it nothing wonky happen and

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:47.750
sure like it nothing wonky happen and
 

00:13:47.750 --> 00:13:48.820
sure like it nothing wonky happen and
then you saw okay great

00:13:48.820 --> 00:13:48.830
then you saw okay great
 

00:13:48.830 --> 00:13:50.860
then you saw okay great
I'm good I'm done but if you actually do

00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:50.870
I'm good I'm done but if you actually do
 

00:13:50.870 --> 00:13:52.510
I'm good I'm done but if you actually do
have a use case and you want to adapt

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:52.520

your app for dos here's what you need to

00:13:55.180 --> 00:13:55.190
your app for dos here's what you need to
 

00:13:55.190 --> 00:13:58.390
your app for dos here's what you need to

app kind of talked about this but will

00:13:59.860 --> 00:13:59.870
app kind of talked about this but will

does affect it if you think about how

00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:01.700
does affect it if you think about how
 

00:14:01.700 --> 00:14:03.670
does affect it if you think about how
your background syncs run and your jobs

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:03.680
your background syncs run and your jobs
 

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:05.440
your background syncs run and your jobs
run how important are they to the core

00:14:05.440 --> 00:14:05.450
run how important are they to the core

likely this shouldn't affect it because
like I said we stepped into this

00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:14.870
like I said we stepped into this
 

00:14:14.870 --> 00:14:16.630
like I said we stepped into this
carefully like we accounted for things

00:14:16.630 --> 00:14:16.640
carefully like we accounted for things
 

00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:18.940
carefully like we accounted for things
like alarm clocks into user usage but

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:18.950
like alarm clocks into user usage but
 

00:14:18.950 --> 00:14:20.290
like alarm clocks into user usage but
you know if it does and you'll want to

00:14:20.290 --> 00:14:20.300
you know if it does and you'll want to
 

00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:21.910
you know if it does and you'll want to
take a look at that so a common solution

00:14:21.910 --> 00:14:21.920
take a look at that so a common solution
 

00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:24.190
take a look at that so a common solution
here and this is actually just a general

best practice is to use downstream

00:14:25.630 --> 00:14:25.640

we added is that it can only be

we added is that it can only be

we added is that it can only be
triggered once every 15 minutes which is

how that whitelist works okay so that's

00:17:36.310 --> 00:17:36.320
how that whitelist works okay so that's
 

00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:38.049
how that whitelist works okay so that's
doze mode it has a counterpart and

00:17:38.049 --> 00:17:38.059
doze mode it has a counterpart and
 

00:17:38.059 --> 00:17:38.990
doze mode it has a counterpart and
that's called apps

00:17:38.990 --> 00:17:39.000
that's called apps
 

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:41.210
that's called apps
and this is also intrusive marshmallow

00:17:41.210 --> 00:17:41.220
and this is also intrusive marshmallow
 

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.800
and this is also intrusive marshmallow
also affects all M devices whether or

not you're targeting it but the

00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:44.520
not you're targeting it but the
 

00:17:44.520 --> 00:17:47.570
not you're targeting it but the
difference here is that ab standby was

00:17:47.570 --> 00:17:47.580
difference here is that ab standby was
 

00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.640
difference here is that ab standby was
created for apps while the device is

00:17:49.640 --> 00:17:49.650
created for apps while the device is
 

00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.290
created for apps while the device is
still running while those such on the

00:17:51.290 --> 00:17:51.300
still running while those such on the
 

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.160
still running while those such on the
entire device

00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:52.170
entire device
 

00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:53.870
entire device
so while doze might result in maybe

00:17:53.870 --> 00:17:53.880
so while doze might result in maybe
 

00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:55.340
so while doze might result in maybe
everything being out of sync by about

00:17:55.340 --> 00:17:55.350
everything being out of sync by about
 

00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:57.770
everything being out of sync by about
four hours app standby could mean that

00:17:57.770 --> 00:17:57.780
four hours app standby could mean that
 

00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.450
four hours app standby could mean that
your app hasn't gotten any attention in

00:17:59.450 --> 00:17:59.460
your app hasn't gotten any attention in
 

00:17:59.460 --> 00:18:01.580
your app hasn't gotten any attention in
a couple of days and that's why you have

00:18:01.580 --> 00:18:01.590
a couple of days and that's why you have
 

00:18:01.590 --> 00:18:03.950
a couple of days and that's why you have
to think about this differently but

00:18:03.950 --> 00:18:03.960
to think about this differently but
 

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.050
to think about this differently but
again we have one goal preserving

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:06.060
again we have one goal preserving
 

00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:08.030
again we have one goal preserving
battery life and so that's the main

00:18:08.030 --> 00:18:08.040
battery life and so that's the main
 

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:09.140
battery life and so that's the main
thing to keep in mind as you go through

00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:09.150
thing to keep in mind as you go through
 

00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:11.930
thing to keep in mind as you go through
this so it's the exact same problem

00:18:11.930 --> 00:18:11.940
this so it's the exact same problem
 

00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:13.910
this so it's the exact same problem
before we need to achieve this as much

00:18:13.910 --> 00:18:13.920
before we need to achieve this as much
 

00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.530
before we need to achieve this as much
as we can and abs that aren't being used

00:18:15.530 --> 00:18:15.540
as we can and abs that aren't being used
 

00:18:15.540 --> 00:18:17.000
as we can and abs that aren't being used
or a drain on the battery when they're

00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:17.010
or a drain on the battery when they're
 

00:18:17.010 --> 00:18:18.800
or a drain on the battery when they're
sinking and so we want to batch all of

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:18.810
sinking and so we want to batch all of
 

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.540
sinking and so we want to batch all of
those and our maintenance windows will

00:18:20.540 --> 00:18:20.550
those and our maintenance windows will
 

00:18:20.550 --> 00:18:24.830
those and our maintenance windows will
let us do that so kind of like why have

00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:24.840
let us do that so kind of like why have
 

00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.910
let us do that so kind of like why have
both and here's the main use case so app

00:18:28.910 --> 00:18:28.920
both and here's the main use case so app
 

00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:30.860
both and here's the main use case so app
standby and O's are different in the

00:18:30.860 --> 00:18:30.870
standby and O's are different in the
 

00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:32.840
standby and O's are different in the
main sense of what they effect an app at

00:18:32.840 --> 00:18:32.850
main sense of what they effect an app at
 

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:34.940
main sense of what they effect an app at
a time or the entire device they both

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:34.950
a time or the entire device they both
 

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:37.010
a time or the entire device they both
restrict network access so that you know

00:18:37.010 --> 00:18:37.020
restrict network access so that you know
 

00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:38.540
restrict network access so that you know
nobody can access the radio while

00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:38.550
nobody can access the radio while
 

00:18:38.550 --> 00:18:39.410
nobody can access the radio while
they're in this mode

00:18:39.410 --> 00:18:39.420
they're in this mode
 

00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:41.720
they're in this mode
they both halt all jobs and sinks

00:18:41.720 --> 00:18:41.730
they both halt all jobs and sinks
 

00:18:41.730 --> 00:18:43.040
they both halt all jobs and sinks
because those are the things we want to

00:18:43.040 --> 00:18:43.050
because those are the things we want to
 

00:18:43.050 --> 00:18:46.760
because those are the things we want to
batch but alarms and wakelocks are both

00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:46.770
batch but alarms and wakelocks are both
 

00:18:46.770 --> 00:18:48.980
batch but alarms and wakelocks are both
going to be honored while we are in app

00:18:48.980 --> 00:18:48.990
going to be honored while we are in app
 

00:18:48.990 --> 00:18:51.050
going to be honored while we are in app
standby and this is what's going to make

00:18:51.050 --> 00:18:51.060
standby and this is what's going to make
 

00:18:51.060 --> 00:18:53.030
standby and this is what's going to make
all of the difference because if your

00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:53.040
all of the difference because if your
 

00:18:53.040 --> 00:18:55.010
all of the difference because if your
app hasn't been used in a while but it's

00:18:55.010 --> 00:18:55.020
app hasn't been used in a while but it's
 

00:18:55.020 --> 00:18:56.990
app hasn't been used in a while but it's
put on the standby list and then your

00:18:56.990 --> 00:18:57.000
put on the standby list and then your
 

00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:58.910
put on the standby list and then your
alarm is triggered because you have like

00:18:58.910 --> 00:18:58.920
alarm is triggered because you have like
 

00:18:58.920 --> 00:19:00.560
alarm is triggered because you have like
maybe a daily reminder or you have

00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:00.570
maybe a daily reminder or you have
 

00:19:00.570 --> 00:19:02.120
maybe a daily reminder or you have
something that's important and you need

00:19:02.120 --> 00:19:02.130
something that's important and you need
 

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:03.170
something that's important and you need
to present that to the user and get

00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:03.180
to present that to the user and get
 

00:19:03.180 --> 00:19:04.730
to present that to the user and get
their attention back to your app you're

00:19:04.730 --> 00:19:04.740
their attention back to your app you're
 

00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:06.710
their attention back to your app you're
out of app standby like as soon as you

00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:06.720
out of app standby like as soon as you
 

00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:08.570
out of app standby like as soon as you
present a notification like that's like

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:08.580
present a notification like that's like
 

00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:10.010
present a notification like that's like
you're good to go so you're not forced

00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:10.020
you're good to go so you're not forced
 

00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:11.720
you're good to go so you're not forced
by the system you're just kind of halted

00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:11.730
by the system you're just kind of halted
 

00:19:11.730 --> 00:19:12.890
by the system you're just kind of halted
while the system notices you're not

00:19:12.890 --> 00:19:12.900
while the system notices you're not
 

00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:14.690
while the system notices you're not
being used and then as soon as you are

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:14.700
being used and then as soon as you are
 

00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:16.130
being used and then as soon as you are
being used you're immediately released

00:19:16.130 --> 00:19:16.140
being used you're immediately released
 

00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:17.540
being used you're immediately released
and you have a little bit of control

00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:17.550
and you have a little bit of control
 

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:20.660
and you have a little bit of control
over how that gets triggered okay so

00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:20.670
over how that gets triggered okay so
 

00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:22.130
over how that gets triggered okay so
when your app is actually put on standby

00:19:22.130 --> 00:19:22.140
when your app is actually put on standby
 

00:19:22.140 --> 00:19:25.460
when your app is actually put on standby
it's because the user isn't using you

00:19:25.460 --> 00:19:25.470
it's because the user isn't using you
 

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:27.320
it's because the user isn't using you
they haven't opened your app they

00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:27.330
they haven't opened your app they
 

00:19:27.330 --> 00:19:28.700
they haven't opened your app they
haven't interacted with your app they

00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:28.710
haven't interacted with your app they
 

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:29.990
haven't interacted with your app they
haven't like really kind of like touched

00:19:29.990 --> 00:19:30.000
haven't like really kind of like touched
 

00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.500
haven't like really kind of like touched
it at all in quite a long while and you

00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:33.510
it at all in quite a long while and you
 

00:19:33.510 --> 00:19:34.910
it at all in quite a long while and you
don't have a foreground service or

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:34.920
don't have a foreground service or
 

00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.890
don't have a foreground service or
activity or another app using a

00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:36.900
activity or another app using a
 

00:19:36.900 --> 00:19:38.330
activity or another app using a
foreground service that you wrote you're

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:38.340
foreground service that you wrote you're
 

00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:39.470
foreground service that you wrote you're
not playing any music you're not

00:19:39.470 --> 00:19:39.480
not playing any music you're not
 

00:19:39.480 --> 00:19:40.940
not playing any music you're not
streaming and you think you're just kind

00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:40.950
streaming and you think you're just kind
 

00:19:40.950 --> 00:19:42.680
streaming and you think you're just kind
of chilling and then finally you don't

00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:42.690
of chilling and then finally you don't
 

00:19:42.690 --> 00:19:45.740
of chilling and then finally you don't
have any pending notifications and so

00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:45.750
have any pending notifications and so
 

00:19:45.750 --> 00:19:47.240
have any pending notifications and so
this is my honor and wake locks and

00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:47.250
this is my honor and wake locks and
 

00:19:47.250 --> 00:19:48.830
this is my honor and wake locks and
alarms are so important because you do

00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:48.840
alarms are so important because you do
 

00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:50.180
alarms are so important because you do
have a chance to yourself out of standby

00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:50.190
have a chance to yourself out of standby
 

00:19:50.190 --> 00:19:52.790
have a chance to yourself out of standby
but for the most part you are

00:19:52.790 --> 00:19:52.800
but for the most part you are
 

00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.320
but for the most part you are
put on standby because you were actually

00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:54.330
put on standby because you were actually
 

00:19:54.330 --> 00:19:56.930
put on standby because you were actually
like just showing like nobody was using

00:19:56.930 --> 00:19:56.940
like just showing like nobody was using
 

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:58.070
like just showing like nobody was using
you so it's not that you're not a

00:19:58.070 --> 00:19:58.080
you so it's not that you're not a
 

00:19:58.080 --> 00:19:59.600
you so it's not that you're not a
successful app like you're still passing

00:19:59.600 --> 00:19:59.610
successful app like you're still passing
 

00:19:59.610 --> 00:20:00.800
successful app like you're still passing
the toothbrush test it's just the other

00:20:00.800 --> 00:20:00.810
the toothbrush test it's just the other
 

00:20:00.810 --> 00:20:03.580
the toothbrush test it's just the other
23 hours of the day

00:20:03.580 --> 00:20:03.590
23 hours of the day
 

00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:07.010
23 hours of the day
okay so app standby ends when the user

00:20:07.010 --> 00:20:07.020
okay so app standby ends when the user
 

00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:09.320
okay so app standby ends when the user
launches your app obviously or the

00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:09.330
launches your app obviously or the
 

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:11.330
launches your app obviously or the
device is plugged in when all apps are

00:20:11.330 --> 00:20:11.340
device is plugged in when all apps are
 

00:20:11.340 --> 00:20:12.590
device is plugged in when all apps are
released from standby mode because they

00:20:12.590 --> 00:20:12.600
released from standby mode because they
 

00:20:12.600 --> 00:20:15.230
released from standby mode because they
don't worry about power anymore or when

00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:15.240
don't worry about power anymore or when
 

00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.610
don't worry about power anymore or when
any work that you're doing based on your

any work that you're doing based on your
 

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:18.190
any work that you're doing based on your
way clock or your alarm manager is

00:20:18.190 --> 00:20:18.200
way clock or your alarm manager is
 

00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:22.120

creating a notification super super easy

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:22.130
creating a notification super super easy
 

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:25.460
creating a notification super super easy
but I guess you're kind of wondering

00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:25.470
but I guess you're kind of wondering
 

00:20:25.470 --> 00:20:27.170
but I guess you're kind of wondering
like why really bother with that if it's

00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:27.180
like why really bother with that if it's
 

00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:29.180
like why really bother with that if it's
so much controlled by the developer the

00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:29.190
so much controlled by the developer the
 

00:20:29.190 --> 00:20:30.680
so much controlled by the developer the
main thing about app standby is when

00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:30.690
main thing about app standby is when
 

00:20:30.690 --> 00:20:31.880
main thing about app standby is when
you're in app standby mode we offer

00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:31.890
you're in app standby mode we offer
 

00:20:31.890 --> 00:20:33.230
you're in app standby mode we offer
those periodic maintenance windows

00:20:33.230 --> 00:20:33.240
those periodic maintenance windows
 

00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:34.310
those periodic maintenance windows
similar to doze and you have a

00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:34.320
similar to doze and you have a
 

00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:35.750
similar to doze and you have a
guaranteed maintenance window of at

00:20:35.750 --> 00:20:35.760
guaranteed maintenance window of at
 

00:20:35.760 --> 00:20:37.580
guaranteed maintenance window of at
least once every 24 hours

00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:37.590
least once every 24 hours
 

00:20:37.590 --> 00:20:39.950
least once every 24 hours
so think about an app that you don't use

00:20:39.950 --> 00:20:39.960
so think about an app that you don't use
 

00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:42.110
so think about an app that you don't use
often like maybe a movie player right

00:20:42.110 --> 00:20:42.120
often like maybe a movie player right
 

00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:43.850
often like maybe a movie player right
like you want it to be ready when you're

you might not use it for two months at a
 

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.060
you might not use it for two months at a

very useful applications they're just

00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:23.130
very useful applications they're just
 

00:21:23.130 --> 00:21:25.130
very useful applications they're just
not used all day long and that's why we

00:21:25.130 --> 00:21:25.140
not used all day long and that's why we
 

00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:26.600
not used all day long and that's why we
created this because we want to empower

00:21:26.600 --> 00:21:26.610
created this because we want to empower
 

00:21:26.610 --> 00:21:28.820
created this because we want to empower
those applications but also trying to

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:28.830
those applications but also trying to
 

00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:31.130
those applications but also trying to
like let them know that they're not you

00:21:31.130 --> 00:21:31.140
like let them know that they're not you
 

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:32.780

know don't drain the battery like we'll

00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:32.790
know don't drain the battery like we'll

know don't drain the battery like we'll
put you together with a bunch of others

00:21:34.100 --> 00:21:34.110
put you together with a bunch of others
 

00:21:34.110 --> 00:21:35.450
put you together with a bunch of others
and everyone will have a much better

00:21:35.450 --> 00:21:35.460
and everyone will have a much better
 

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.120
and everyone will have a much better
time but the trick here is you probably

00:21:38.120 --> 00:21:38.130
time but the trick here is you probably
 

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.560
time but the trick here is you probably
still don't have to do anything if

like runs sync every so often it'll
still run everyday like still hitting my
