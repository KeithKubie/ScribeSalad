00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:15.240
WW2 saw the nations of the world investing
massive amounts of manpower and money into

00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:19.680
the development of better ways to extinguish
life in hopes of turning the tide of the war

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:25.730
in their respective favors, sometimes including
coming up with outlandish contraptions like

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:32.040
(surprisingly effective) bat bombs and pigeon
guided missiles, anti-tank dogs, flying jeeps

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:37.899
and tanks, suicide torpedoes, super ships
made of ice, and even balloon bombs randomly

00:00:37.899 --> 00:00:42.739
sent out with the hope they might land somewhere
thousands of miles away on enemy soil.

00:00:42.739 --> 00:00:49.179
Today we’ll be looking at another notable
WWII weapon, the V-3 cannon- a piece of artillery

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:54.079
capable of hitting a target more than 100
miles (165 km) away, shooting its projectiles

00:00:54.079 --> 00:00:59.559
at around 3,400 mph (5500 km/h)!

00:00:59.559 --> 00:01:05.100
Technically defined as a “supergun”, a
term given to guns of such comically large

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.610
size they need to be categorised separately,
the V-3 was 430 feet long (131 metres).

00:01:12.610 --> 00:01:17.229
This massive size meant that the gun had to
be built already aiming at its target and

00:01:17.229 --> 00:01:22.540
could only reliably hit a target the size
of a city, a fairly minor trade-off considering

00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:27.130
the weapon’s nigh-unparalleled range for
a non-rocket based weapon.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.759
The V-3 was able to achieve the incredible
projectile range due to a rather unique firing

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:38.479
mechanism that utilized multiple smaller explosions,
rather than one big one, along the length

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:43.009
of its barrel set to go off just as the projectile
passed these side chambers.

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:48.080
This allowed the supergun to fire its payload
at extreme distances without damaging the

00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:52.039
barrel, which had proved to be a problem for
other, similarly massive guns.

00:01:52.039 --> 00:01:56.479
kaiser-gunNotable here, for reasons we’ll
get to in a minute, is the so-called Kaiser

00:01:56.479 --> 00:02:00.649
Wilhelm Geschütz (quite literally, Emperor
Wilhelm Gun).

00:02:00.649 --> 00:02:07.200
This was a 200 ton, 111 foot long gun used
by the Germans to shell Paris during WW1.

00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:12.570
It could only fire around 60 rounds before
its entire barrel needed to be replaced due

00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:19.379
to damage from the explosions used to launch
its 106 kilo or 236 pound shells.

00:02:19.379 --> 00:02:24.050
The projectiles also had to be numbered and
fired in a specific order, with each one slightly

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:28.590
bigger than the previous one to account for
the increasing diameter of the barrel as the

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:31.230
massive cannon was fired each time.

00:02:31.230 --> 00:02:35.909
The Emperor gun was so powerful, it was noted
for being the first man-made invention to

00:02:35.909 --> 00:02:40.650
launch an object into the stratosphere, with
the shells it launched peaking at an altitude

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:43.240
of around 40 kilometres during flight.

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:48.020
The range of the gun was so unthinkably extreme
for such a weapon that the 80 man team in

00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:52.909
charge of firing it had to aim a little under
a kilometre “to the left” of the target

00:02:52.909 --> 00:02:54.880
to account for the Coriolis effect.

00:02:54.880 --> 00:02:59.459
The French military genuinely suspected for
a time that these projectiles were being launched

00:02:59.459 --> 00:03:04.190
from super-high Zeppelins hiding behind clouds
because the idea of them being fired from

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:10.720
a gun up to 75 miles (120 km) away was deemed
to be too absurd.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:15.610
Virtually all records of this gun’s existence
and how it was constructed were destroyed

00:03:15.610 --> 00:03:17.490
towards the close of WW1.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.489
Nonetheless, it was known to the French and
in response they drafted plans for an even

00:03:22.489 --> 00:03:27.860
bigger gun that utilised multiple explosions
to launch projectiles a similar distance.

00:03:27.860 --> 00:03:29.260
Sound familiar?

00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:33.990
These plans were ultimately archived by the
French after WW1 and were found by German

00:03:33.990 --> 00:03:39.080
soldiers in 1940 who then passed them onto
August Cönders, the guy who designed the

00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:40.080
V-3 cannon…

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:44.959
In other words, the only reason the V-3 cannon
was even invented is because the Germans found

00:03:44.959 --> 00:03:50.530
plans at the start of WW2 explicitly drafted
to counter another giant gun they’d used

00:03:50.530 --> 00:03:52.299
during WW1.

00:03:52.299 --> 00:03:57.610
In any event, beyond its massive range, a
battery of V-3 cannons could fire close to

00:03:57.610 --> 00:04:01.190
300 shells an hour, or roughly one shell every
12 seconds.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:05.450
This is a fact that piqued the interest of
Hitler himself, who enthusiastically granted

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:10.370
the project near unlimited support when existence
of a prototype was brought to his attention

00:04:10.370 --> 00:04:16.550
in 1943 by his advisor, Albert Speer, even
though said prototype had yet to fire a single

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:17.550
shell.

00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.940
With Hitler throwing everything the German
military had at its disposal behind the project

00:04:21.940 --> 00:04:28.040
in mid-1943, the V-3 cannon, dubbed the “Hochdruckpumpe”
or “High-Pressure Pump” during construction

00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.490
to hide its purpose from spies, went from
the idea phase to construction almost immediately.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.980
Since Hitler wanted to use the gun to shell
London, and the gun had to be built aiming

00:04:38.980 --> 00:04:43.470
at its target, the location had to be somewhere
in Northern France.

00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:48.310
The gun also needed to be built within close
proximity to a railway (due to the size of

00:04:48.310 --> 00:04:52.650
its ammunition which could only be transported
effectively via rail).

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:57.070
Luckily for the Nazis, an ideal location was
found in the form of limestone hill located

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:59.450
in the French hamlet of Mimoyecques in Landrethun-le-Nord.

00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.860
The location was deemed ideal as the chalk
that made up most of the hill would be easy

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:09.270
to excavate but was ultimately strong enough
to tunnel through to create the underground

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:11.650
infrastructure needed for the weapon.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:17.400
gun-siteConstruction of 50, V-3 guns began
in earnest in September of 1943 utilising

00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:21.470
a combination of drafted German engineers
and Soviet POWs.

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:26.900
The initial plan was for two separate facilities
to be constructed roughly 1000 metres apart,

00:05:26.900 --> 00:05:32.090
each housing 25 V-3 cannons built into drifts
dug into the hillside.

00:05:32.090 --> 00:05:36.170
They also planned to build tunnels connecting
each facility that would be used for storing

00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:41.280
the shells, which in turn would be transported
to the guns via an underground railway.

00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:45.320
Amazingly, construction of most of the underground
tunnels was completed.

00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.580
However, construction of the guns themselves
was severely hampered when the allies learned

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:56.180
of a German plan to attack London using an
unknown superweapon in the latter stages of

00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:57.180
1943.

00:05:57.180 --> 00:06:02.800
Knowing that the Germans were planning something
at Mimoyecques, and putting two and two together,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:09.110
the RAF doggedly attacked it throughout the
last few months of 1943 and the first half

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:10.240
of 1944.

00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:16.070
This led to the proposed number of V-3 cannons
dropping from 50 to 25 when the RAF destroyed

00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:17.940
the Western-most site.

00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:22.350
This was further reduced to 5 following a
bombing run utilising “tallboy” bombs

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:27.280
specifically designed to destroy fortified
bunkers on July 6, 1944.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:32.210
Plans were dropped altogether in on July 30th
that same year due to the advance of allied

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:33.210
ground troops.

00:06:33.210 --> 00:06:37.350
The allies wouldn’t actually learn about
the existence of the V-3 cannons until after

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:41.720
the war, at which point then Prime Minister
Winston Churchill was reported as saying that

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:47.030
the site could have been responsible for the
“most devastating attack of all on London”.

00:06:47.030 --> 00:06:52.350
Although the Nazis never got a full-size V-3
cannon working during WW2, they did manage

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:56.740
to construct two much smaller versions of
the weapon with which they shelled the recently

00:06:56.740 --> 00:07:02.240
liberated Luxembourg from a somewhat less
impressive distance of 43 kilometres (26 miles)

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:03.830
away in late 1944.

00:07:03.830 --> 00:07:09.080
Smaller, but still impressively powered, these
mini V-3’s were capable of shooting off

00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:15.990
their deadly projectiles at speeds of over
2,000 mph or 3300 km/h.

00:07:15.990 --> 00:07:21.010
Despite the impressive specs, and with the
guns firing hundreds of rounds (142 of which

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:25.400
hit Luxembourg), only 10 people were killed
and 35 wounded as a result.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:30.130
While the Nazis tried desperately to use the
gun again, even deploying one during their

00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:36.180
last major offensive of WW2, Operation Nordwind,
they never actually successfully fired another

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:41.560
version of the V-3 again during the entire
war, giving these guns a laughably low kill

00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:44.200
rate given the resources put into them.

00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.480
Today the failed location of the French battery
has been converted to a museum containing

00:07:49.480 --> 00:08:01.870
what remains of the guns.
