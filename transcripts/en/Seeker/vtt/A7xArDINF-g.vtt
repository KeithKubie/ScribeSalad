00:00:00.099 --> 00:00:05.460
Interrogators are known for their ways of
making you talk . And they can make you talk.

00:00:05.460 --> 00:00:11.590
Even about things that never happened.

00:00:11.590 --> 00:00:13.730
Hello viewers, Trace here for DNews.

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:17.340
You may think your memory is perfect, or you
may be like me and occasionally forget your

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:18.340
own name.

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:22.090
But there is an interesting third option for
memory; you may remember things that never

00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:23.090
even happened.

00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:27.820
A study in Psychological Science showed that
by using the right, or rather the wrong techniques,

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:30.960
people can be led to think they’ve done
things they never did.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.269
Serious things that got the police involved.

00:00:33.269 --> 00:00:35.559
Things you would and should probably remember
doing.

00:00:35.559 --> 00:00:40.149
Lead researcher Julia Shaw and her team contacted
the caregivers of 60 students from the University

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:41.249
of British Columbia.

00:00:41.249 --> 00:00:44.410
They asked them to give them specific accounts
of events in the students lives from when

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:45.789
they were 11 to 14.

00:00:45.789 --> 00:00:50.019
Then the researchers brought in the students
for a series of 3 interviews each a week apart.

00:00:50.019 --> 00:00:53.999
In the first interview the students were told
about 2 events from adolescence, except one

00:00:53.999 --> 00:00:55.389
of them wasn’t real.

00:00:55.389 --> 00:00:58.499
The researchers would tell them the student
had either committed some sort of crime like

00:00:58.499 --> 00:01:02.710
assault or theft, or had experienced some
emotional trauma like being attacked by a

00:01:02.710 --> 00:01:03.710
dog.

00:01:03.710 --> 00:01:06.810
Even though the story overall was fake, the
researchers sprinkled in some real details

00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:08.299
from that time in the student’s life.

00:01:08.299 --> 00:01:12.159
Then the subjects were asked to explain what
had happened, and when they understandably

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:15.960
struggled to remember the thing they had never
done, interviewers encouraged them to try

00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:18.380
anyway and focus on specific details.

00:01:18.380 --> 00:01:22.020
In the second and third interviews the students
were asked again to describe both events.

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:26.100
If you think you would have called shenanigans
at this point, you’re probably wrong.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:29.700
71% of the students who were told they had
committed a crime in their youth actually

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:31.090
believed they had done it.

00:01:31.090 --> 00:01:34.240
55% of them gave detailed accounts of their
dealings with the police.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.340
The subjects that were told they had emotional
trauma didn’t fare better, with 76% of them

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:42.040
giving specific details and confidently recounting
the experience.

00:01:42.040 --> 00:01:45.530
You may think people with better memories
would be more resistant to being inceptioned,

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:46.670
but that’s not the case.

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:52.210
A study at UC Irvine tested ordinary people
along with some who had Highly Superior Autobiographical

00:01:52.210 --> 00:01:53.210
Memory.

00:01:53.210 --> 00:01:56.990
The subjects with HSAM could remember what
day of the week specific dates were, and could

00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.460
tell you exactly when major events took place.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:02.430
These people have no excuse for forgetting
anniversaries.

00:02:02.430 --> 00:02:05.939
And yet when they were baited into thinking
they had seen things they hadn’t, like footage

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:10.670
of United flight 93 crashing in Pennsylvania
on September 11th, subjects with super memory

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.080
took the bait as often as everyone else, about
a fifth of the time.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.640
These studies highlight just how malleable
our memories are, and how they can be shaped

00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.830
with a little coaxing.

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:22.940
It has big implications for police interviews
and interrogations, and now I really want

00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.940
to listen to all of Jay’s interviews from
Serial again.

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:29.830
For more proof that your brain is a dirty
liar, Anthony elaborates on false memories

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:30.830
here.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.080
What’s another quirk of the human brain
you think is interesting?

00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.890
If there’s one we haven’t covered, let
us know in the comments and we’ll check

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:36.890
it out…

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:37.890
If we remember to.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:39.220
See you next time on DNews.
