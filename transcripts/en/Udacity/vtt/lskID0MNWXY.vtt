00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:03.080
Now that we've installed Finger,
let's use it.

00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.020
This application will look up various
pieces of information about a user, and

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.200
display it in an easy to read format.

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.540
If I type Finger, the command
will output information about

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.250
all of the users currently
logged into the system.

00:00:15.250 --> 00:00:17.980
You can see the vagrant user here,
that's us, and

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:19.620
the last time we logged in.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:22.710
You can also pass a username
to the Finger application

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:26.410
to see additional information
about a specific user.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.220
Type finger vagrant, and
you'll see some additional information

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:32.080
including our home directory and
what shell we're using.
