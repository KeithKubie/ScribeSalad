00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:51.630
mental level as me when he just wasn't
and I didn't understand that and so it

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:51.640
and I didn't understand that and so it
 

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.010
and I didn't understand that and so it
made things uncomfortable and I just

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:53.020
made things uncomfortable and I just
 

00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:54.390
made things uncomfortable and I just

him anymore because I didn't understand
 

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:58.170
him anymore because I didn't understand
it and if I had had that understanding I

00:02:58.170 --> 00:02:58.180
it and if I had had that understanding I
 

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.699
it and if I had had that understanding I
would have spent more time with him and

00:02:59.699 --> 00:02:59.709
would have spent more time with him and
 

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.830
would have spent more time with him and
