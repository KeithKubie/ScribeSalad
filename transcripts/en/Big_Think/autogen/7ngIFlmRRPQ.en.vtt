this in order to be an engineer you have
 

00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:13.899
this in order to be an engineer you have
to have an IQ about a standard deviation

00:01:13.899 --> 00:01:13.909
to have an IQ about a standard deviation
 

00:01:13.909 --> 00:01:16.809
to have an IQ about a standard deviation
or more above average that's an IQ of

or more above average that's an IQ of
 

00:01:16.819 --> 00:01:20.590
or more above average that's an IQ of
about 115 or so and another recent paper

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:20.600
about 115 or so and another recent paper
 

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:21.819
about 115 or so and another recent paper
shows that there's no relationship

00:01:21.819 --> 00:01:21.829
shows that there's no relationship

surprised to have failures but they
 

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.470
surprised to have failures but they
realized when they looked more carefully

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:33.480
realized when they looked more carefully
 

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:36.140
realized when they looked more carefully
that these were people who were hired

00:03:36.140 --> 00:03:36.150
that these were people who were hired
 

00:03:36.150 --> 00:03:39.710
