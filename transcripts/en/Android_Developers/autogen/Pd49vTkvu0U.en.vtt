00:00:06.888 --> 00:00:09.790
 MOR SHANI: Our dream was to become a wonderful and inspirational gaming company 

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:10.650
 to be. 

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:15.300
 "Pirate King" was the first game we created entirely ourselves, 

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.990
 five people who worked hard on the game. 

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:20.105
 For us this experience was very important. 

00:00:20.105 --> 00:00:23.120
 MOTI NOVO: Mor and I met when we were in grade seven. 

00:00:23.120 --> 00:00:24.725
 We are the best friends ever since. 

00:00:24.725 --> 00:00:26.910
 We both loved playing games. 

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.900
 We traveled with the other founders 

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.605
 started when we were 21. 

00:00:30.605 --> 00:00:32.020
 It was really exciting. 

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.552
 We want to touch people through our games. 

00:00:34.552 --> 00:00:38.055
 MOR SHANI: "Pirate King" is a very simple game and fun. 

00:00:38.055 --> 00:00:40.000
 You turn the wheel, and then you can 

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.400
 attack your friends and other friends from other islands. 

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.090
 You can also steal money from them, 

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.850
 And this leads to this effect of involvement. 

00:00:49.850 --> 00:00:51.780
 We wanted the single player 

00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.440
 and take and multiplayer experience 

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:57.030
 create this mixed player experience. 

00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:01.010
 This is a unique experience we have not yet encountered 

00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:04.280
 have seen mobile devices. 

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.190
 When "Pirate King" started, we had 200 installations a day. 

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:09.790
 It was very small. 

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.750
 We have seen the growth in Israel begin. 

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.990
 And then it started to grow in the US, and then in Europe, 

00:01:14.990 --> 00:01:16.450
 and then in Asia. 

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:21.190
 Today we have over 200,000 installations a day. 

00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:23.670
 There are over 18 million users 

00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:27.450
 "Pirate King" plays and over 60% of them are Android. 

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.720
 Android revenue represents 50% of our total revenue, 

00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:33.710
 which is incredible to us. 

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.020
 Going to new markets would be supernatural 

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:40.685
 and build our Android growth and platform strategy. 

00:01:40.685 --> 00:01:43.060
 RON REJWAN: Our experience in developing "Pirate Kings" 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:44.455
 for Android was very positive. 

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.990
 Quick iterations, the time to upload it to production 

00:01:47.990 --> 00:01:51.810
 is the shortest of all the platforms we support. 

00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:53.450
 Debugging is really good. 

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:56.329
 In general, we love the platform. 

00:01:56.329 --> 00:01:58.870
 One of the most important tools we use to collect and analyze data, 

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:00.315
 is Google BigQuery. 

00:02:00.315 --> 00:02:04.050
 We receive about three billion opportunities a month. 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:05.630
 One of the times we are very important 

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.670
 received information from Analytics, 

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:11.850
 was when we noticed a 40% decrease in users in a particular step. 

00:02:11.850 --> 00:02:14.120
 But when we look at that part of the code again, 

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:16.760
 we found out there was a mistake. We fixed it and restored it 

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:18.150
 back to 90% increase. 

00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:18.735
 That's essential. 

00:02:18.735 --> 00:02:21.580
 You need Analytics. 

00:02:21.580 --> 00:02:24.960
 My main tip to people who have a cross platform game 

00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:28.110
 or program is to first develop Android, as 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.530
 because of the fast iterations, how easy it is to build, 

00:02:31.530 --> 00:02:33.695
 and how fast you can deploy it to production. 

00:02:33.695 --> 00:02:36.214
 And all this together makes it the platform 

00:02:36.214 --> 00:02:38.297
 on which we had the best experience of deploying to production, 

00:02:38.297 --> 00:02:40.360
 on such a large scale. 

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:42.950
 MOR Shani: It was an incredible trip for us. 

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.920
 From small offices to big ones, to grow from five people 

00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:49.910
 up to 30 people, this is something very exciting. 

00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:53.310
 And we can't wait to release even more incredible games for our community and 

00:02:53.310 --> 00:02:54.960
 not the world.
