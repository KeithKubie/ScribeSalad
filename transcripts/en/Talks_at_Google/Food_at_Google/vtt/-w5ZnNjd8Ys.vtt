SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: All
right, well, good afternoon,

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:09.940
everybody.

00:00:09.940 --> 00:00:10.910
I'm Scott Giambastiani.

00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.530
I'm with the food
team here at Google.

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:15.320
It's great to have
everyone-- sold out, awesome.

00:00:15.320 --> 00:00:16.160
Raise of hands.

00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:20.730
Who here is at their first
cooking class at Kitchen Sync?

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.560
Raise of hands.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:22.500
I'm just curious.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.620
2, 3, 4, 5, 6?

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:25.910
6 and maybe 7?

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.740
So welcome to Kitchen Sync.

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.330
It is my pleasure to introduce
Laura in a couple of seconds.

00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:32.960
I want to give a quick
background on-- hopefully,

00:00:32.960 --> 00:00:34.370
you know why you're here.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:36.920
Raise of hands, who's
been to the Berkeley Bowl?

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:37.530
Woohoo!

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:38.930
Awesome place.

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:39.840
Very, very exciting.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.200
So I want to give a quick
background on Laura,

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:45.140
and then she's going to dive in
and prepare some of the recipes

00:00:45.140 --> 00:00:48.260
from the cookbook, which I
had the pleasure of reviewing

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.260
in full detail.

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.500
I was talking to her earlier.

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.900
I get a lot of cookbooks
that come past me, obviously,

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:55.100
being on the food team.

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.850
And this is one of the
most exciting books

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:59.540
that I've seen in a long time,
because it talks about so

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:01.550
many unique ingredients
that you see often

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:02.840
on shelves and markets--

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.470
farmers markets, et cetera.

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:05.960
And she's done
such an amazing job

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.270
in making such a very
approachable book,

00:01:08.270 --> 00:01:10.370
to look at these
ingredients in a way that

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.882
are so simple to
execute but so tasty

00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.840
and really highlight the
deliciousness of them.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.400
So congratulations.

00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:19.030
So a quick intro, and
then we'll get let

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:20.330
her get into the good stuff.

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:24.050
So it's my pleasure to
introduce Laura McLively, who

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.520
has authored the "Berkeley Bowl
Cookbook," which celebrates

00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:32.630
the unfamiliar yet extraordinary
produce of California's most

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:35.080
iconic market--
the Berkeley Bowl.

00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:38.535
The cookbook offers
recipes on a variety

00:01:38.535 --> 00:01:40.160
of fruits and
vegetables, some of which

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.250
she's brought with her to kind
of pass around and play with,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:46.380
that are really largely
overlooked in popular cuisine.

00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.080
I think as culinarians,
as home chefs and chefs,

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:50.874
we really get focused
on ingredients

00:01:50.874 --> 00:01:52.040
that we're so familiar with.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.050
And what's really
unique about this book

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.540
is you're able to take a
dive into some ingredients

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.280
that maybe you haven't
seen for a while,

00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.190
or execute them in a way
that maybe you haven't

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:02.570
seen before in the past.

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.200
So Laura is a registered
dietitian, an avid home cook,

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:09.110
creator of the popular
blog, "My Berkeley Bowl."

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:12.770
And she's created recipes from
really the unfamiliar aspects

00:02:12.770 --> 00:02:15.980
of the exotic fruits and
vegetables within the market.

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:18.840
The market has easily
over 1,000 vegetables

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:20.720
and produce items out there.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.880
And she's taken those
hand-selected ones

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.101
that she feels are the
most unique and overlooked.

00:02:26.101 --> 00:02:28.100
Some of the ingredients--
or some of the recipes

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:30.050
that you'll actually
see in the book,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:31.520
that I thought were
super exciting,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:34.100
were things like the
kiwano melon cooler,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.830
the falafel waffles with
Armenian cucumber slaw,

00:02:36.830 --> 00:02:39.110
or the burdock root pizza.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:41.240
She will be sampling three
different items today

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.190
that she'll speak
to, but I wanted

00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.320
to please have everyone
give her a warm applause

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:47.000
so that she can
dive into cooking.

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.426
So please welcome Laura.

00:02:48.426 --> 00:02:51.404
[APPLAUSE]

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:52.820
LAURA MCLIVELY:
Thank you so much.

00:02:52.820 --> 00:02:54.440
I'm really exited to be here.

00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.140
I was telling the Google
team earlier that this is

00:02:57.140 --> 00:02:59.140
my first time here at Google.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.700
And I've been trying to make
it here for quite awhile.

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.010
And I'm excited to finally
have an excuse to be here.

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:05.590
So thank you so much.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:08.660
And thanks for that
really nice introduction.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:10.910
We are going to get
right started cooking,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.049
because I'm sure moments
will come up where I can talk

00:03:14.049 --> 00:03:16.340
a little bit more about my
inspiration behind the book,

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:18.070
but you're here to
see a cooking demo,

00:03:18.070 --> 00:03:20.250
so we're just going
to get started.

00:03:20.250 --> 00:03:22.730
The first dish that we're
going to make is a beverage.

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:24.740
It's called shiso limeade.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:28.300
And there's various
kinds of shiso.

00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:31.010
So actually, this from the
Google garden right here.

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.770
This is red shiso.

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:36.610
And you also grow
the green shiso.

00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.920
And the one that we're using
today is called Chinese shiso.

00:03:40.920 --> 00:03:42.630
So you have to be
kind of careful

00:03:42.630 --> 00:03:44.546
when you're going to
make this recipe that you

00:03:44.546 --> 00:03:47.515
are sure you are identifying
the right kind of shiso.

00:03:47.515 --> 00:03:49.795
So Chinese shiso
looks like this.

00:03:49.795 --> 00:03:53.680
It's a leaf that's commonly
used in Japanese cuisine.

00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:57.390
And it's-- you're going to
look for kind of a heart-shaped

00:03:57.390 --> 00:03:57.890
leaf.

00:03:57.890 --> 00:04:02.090
It's two tones-- the green on
top, and purple on the bottom.

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.450
So you might have seen shiso
before when you order sushi.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:10.730
It sometimes comes on the plate
with the wasabi on top of it.

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:13.260
But a lot of people don't know
that you can actually eat it.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:15.385
So today I'm going show
you one of my favorite ways

00:04:15.385 --> 00:04:17.880
to prepare shiso, which
is in this limeade.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:20.959
So I actually came across
this recipe by mistake.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:24.180
I knew I wanted to serve
shiso as a beverage

00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:28.250
because it kind of has this
refreshing, lemony, herbal,

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:31.800
minty scent, but a really
nice earthy undertone.

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.490
And so I thought, well, that
would make a really great tea.

00:04:34.490 --> 00:04:38.460
So I boiled my water,
and I went ahead

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.630
and added the leaves to it.

00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.921
So we're just going to do that.

00:04:40.921 --> 00:04:42.340
It's really simple.

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:44.060
It's this hot water.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:48.570
And I let it steep for
about 15 to 30 minutes

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:52.110
so that that shiso flavor
really infuses the water.

00:04:52.110 --> 00:04:55.560
And so this is what it looks
like after 15, 30 minutes.

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.880
And so I took the leaves out.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:02.392
Usually you just strain them,
but for the sake of the demo,

00:05:02.392 --> 00:05:04.260
we're just going
to use some tongs.

00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.966
And you can see that
the water is clear.

00:05:13.966 --> 00:05:15.709
It comes out like a clear tea.

00:05:15.709 --> 00:05:18.250
And I tried it, and I thought,
well, that's really delicious,

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:20.000
but I can't really put
that in a cookbook,

00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:23.509
like "add leaves to water"
and, call that a cookbook.

00:05:23.509 --> 00:05:25.300
So I was like, what am
I going to do to it?

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:28.870
So I thought maybe I'll chill it
and I'll add some lime juice so

00:05:28.870 --> 00:05:31.280
that it's kind of like a
refreshing non-alcoholic

00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:32.000
beverage.

00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.050
And this was one of those really
rare moments in the kitchen--

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:37.756
or actually it's not so rare.

00:05:37.756 --> 00:05:40.130
This is one of those special
moments in the kitchen, when

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.410
you're playing around with
foods and you discover

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:44.869
something exciting and magical.

00:05:44.869 --> 00:05:46.160
So I'll show you what happened.

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.160
So I added the lime juice.

00:05:48.160 --> 00:05:52.540
And it turned this bright
pink color, like bubblegum.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.280
So I had no idea this would
happen, and I was just like,

00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.994
oh, my god, this has
to go in the cookbook.

00:05:57.994 --> 00:06:02.130
So we just sweeten it with
a little agave nectar.

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.950
And that's it.

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:06.330
And so you're just going
to serve this on ice.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:11.140
And it's so nice to
serve this at a barbecue

00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:14.150
or party at your house as a
nice, non-alcoholic option

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:17.030
because people expect
it to be pink lemonade,

00:06:17.030 --> 00:06:19.880
and then you can kind of
see on their faces they're

00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.860
surprised by this
flavor in the background

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:24.235
that they don't
really recognize.

00:06:24.235 --> 00:06:25.730
And so that's shiso.

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:29.864
So we'll just pour
ourselves a little glass.

00:06:29.864 --> 00:06:32.420
And it's nice to
garnish it with--

00:06:32.420 --> 00:06:34.410
I shouldn't have put
all the leaves in there.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:37.766
It's nice to garnish it
with some leaves and maybe

00:06:37.766 --> 00:06:38.811
a slice of lime.

00:06:43.421 --> 00:06:46.690
So you can see, it just
has such a beautiful color.

00:06:46.690 --> 00:06:49.610
And kids really like it too.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:53.380
I just had a Memorial Day
barbecue, and I served this.

00:06:53.380 --> 00:06:56.910
And the kids had, like, no
idea that it was this weirdo

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:59.631
herb that they never tried.

00:06:59.631 --> 00:07:01.222
So there you go--

00:07:01.222 --> 00:07:03.030
shiso limeade.

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:05.530
So as you can see,
something like shiso

00:07:05.530 --> 00:07:08.000
that maybe you'd pass
at the grocery store,

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.340
or you've seen it at the
farmer's market, you're like,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:13.259
well, I don't know that it is,
I don't know what to do with it.

00:07:13.259 --> 00:07:15.550
What you find when you start
to bring these things home

00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:18.495
is that they're not as
intimidating as they look.

00:07:18.495 --> 00:07:19.870
And so the thing
I really learned

00:07:19.870 --> 00:07:21.661
in working with these
fruits and vegetables

00:07:21.661 --> 00:07:25.120
is that what's maybe
new to me and kind

00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:29.000
of foreign and intimidating
is as normal to someone else

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.700
as apples and
potatoes are for me.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.250
And we should find out why.

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.940
There's probably a
really good reason

00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:39.650
why it's normal to maybe someone
in another part of the country

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.840
or another part of the world.

00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:44.604
So shiso is one of those foods.

00:07:44.604 --> 00:07:50.016
And so let me just move
this out of the way.

00:07:50.016 --> 00:07:51.000
Thank you.

00:07:55.428 --> 00:07:56.910
Thanks.

00:07:56.910 --> 00:07:58.930
I brought some other
fruits and ve--

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:00.230
we're going to prepare
a couple other dishes,

00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.521
but I brought some things
that I found at Berkeley Bowl

00:08:02.521 --> 00:08:04.730
last night, that
I thought we could

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:07.820
play a little identification
game together.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:14.335
So here's some of them.

00:08:14.335 --> 00:08:16.910
So has anyone seen this before?

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:17.907
OK, great.

00:08:17.907 --> 00:08:18.740
What is this called?

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:19.797
AUDIENCE: Rambutan.

00:08:19.797 --> 00:08:20.880
LAURA MCLIVELY: All right.

00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:23.510
So does anybody know why
it's called rambutan?

00:08:23.510 --> 00:08:24.860
What "rambut" means?

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:26.832
Take a guess.

00:08:26.832 --> 00:08:27.720
AUDIENCE: Hairs.

00:08:27.720 --> 00:08:28.360
LAURA MCLIVELY: Hairs, yeah.

00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:29.990
Rambut means "hair"
in Malaysian.

00:08:29.990 --> 00:08:31.620
So that's why this
is called that.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.940
In the book, the recipe for
this is you just cut around

00:08:35.940 --> 00:08:37.110
this and take off the top.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:38.539
And there's a lychee-like
fruit in the middle.

00:08:38.539 --> 00:08:40.109
And you dip these
in white chocolate

00:08:40.109 --> 00:08:42.090
and dust them with
a little clove.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:44.410
It's a really simple
recipe to enjoy something

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.450
that looks really crazy.

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:50.400
Does anyone know what this is?

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:51.136
AUDIENCE: Cacao?

00:08:51.136 --> 00:08:52.260
LAURA MCLIVELY: Good guess.

00:08:52.260 --> 00:08:53.520
Not cacao.

00:08:53.520 --> 00:08:54.520
AUDIENCE: Banana flower.

00:08:54.520 --> 00:08:56.353
LAURA MCLIVELY: Banana
flower, that's right.

00:08:56.353 --> 00:09:00.770
So these are little baby
bananas, not yet born.

00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.400
So these, you can take
off these outer petals

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.550
and save them as a serving dish.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:08.980
And then there's a core
in it that's sort of

00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:10.560
like an artichoke heart.

00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:14.290
And so you can slice that
up, and in this recipe

00:09:14.290 --> 00:09:15.750
it's stir fried
with glass noodles,

00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:18.055
and then you serve in the petal.

00:09:18.055 --> 00:09:19.890
So we'll do a couple
more of these later,

00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:21.881
but we'll probably
want to move on.

00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.614
OK, so I should mention too
that the cookbook is organized--

00:09:29.614 --> 00:09:32.400
the chapters are organized
by the type of plant

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.620
it is, or the part of the plant.

00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.400
So for instance, the shiso
is out of the Leaves chapter.

00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.330
And then next, we're going to
be doing sea beans and soba out

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:43.184
of the Succulents chapter.

00:09:43.184 --> 00:09:45.600
And the reason we did that is
because when you're shopping

00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:47.700
at a store like Berkeley
Bowl, or when you're

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:51.360
shopping at your farmer's market
or at the local ethnic grocery,

00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.120
usually it's an
ingredient-centric shopping

00:09:54.120 --> 00:09:54.810
experience.

00:09:54.810 --> 00:09:57.195
You're not there saying,
like, I'm going to make this.

00:09:57.195 --> 00:09:59.610
You go, and you wait
to see what you find,

00:09:59.610 --> 00:10:02.080
and then you develop
a meal around it.

00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.070
And so I really wanted
the book to be organized

00:10:05.070 --> 00:10:08.820
in that same way, where you're
focused on the plant itself,

00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:11.138
and then you built
your meal from that.

00:10:11.138 --> 00:10:15.330
So the sea beans are out
of Spores and Succulents.

00:10:15.330 --> 00:10:18.720
And actually, I don't
see my sea beans.

00:10:18.720 --> 00:10:22.380
So maybe they're still chilling.

00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:24.540
So while the sea beans
are on their way,

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:26.850
I'll tell you a
little bit about them.

00:10:26.850 --> 00:10:31.740
So sea beans are a
aquatic succulent.

00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:35.296
They grow in salt-water
marshes on the coastline.

00:10:35.296 --> 00:10:36.795
So one of the cool
things about them

00:10:36.795 --> 00:10:39.200
is that they're
native to this area.

00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:40.260
Thank you.

00:10:40.260 --> 00:10:42.320
You can actually
go out and forage

00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:44.910
for sea beans on our coastline.

00:10:44.910 --> 00:10:49.030
And you can also grow these if
you have a pretty salty soil.

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:51.566
But you can forage
for them, or you

00:10:51.566 --> 00:10:53.924
can go to stores like Berkeley
Bowl or farmer's markets.

00:10:53.924 --> 00:10:55.590
And I know that they
actually serve them

00:10:55.590 --> 00:10:57.435
in the Google kitchens
too, so a lot of you

00:10:57.435 --> 00:10:58.830
have probably had these.

00:10:58.830 --> 00:11:01.950
But I love to just walk
around Berkeley Bowl

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:04.150
and kind of watch
shoppers examine things,

00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:05.900
like, oh my god, what
do you do with that?

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:08.040
And it's kind of
a community where

00:11:08.040 --> 00:11:09.690
if you see someone
grabbing something

00:11:09.690 --> 00:11:11.090
that you don't
recognize, there's

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:12.922
permission to ask,
like, OK, well,

00:11:12.922 --> 00:11:14.380
what are you going
to do with that?

00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:15.588
And, what does it taste like?

00:11:15.588 --> 00:11:18.060
So that's how I learned a
lot with just hanging out

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.070
at the store and
kind of observing

00:11:20.070 --> 00:11:21.660
what other people were doing.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:24.300
But sea beans are the one
thing that, when I grab them,

00:11:24.300 --> 00:11:27.510
people are constantly asking
me what I do with them.

00:11:27.510 --> 00:11:29.980
And the reason I
love these is you

00:11:29.980 --> 00:11:32.100
really don't have to
do anything to them.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.012
Because they are
a succulent, they

00:11:34.012 --> 00:11:35.970
have that, like, nice
crispiness like you would

00:11:35.970 --> 00:11:38.440
expect from biting into, like--

00:11:38.440 --> 00:11:41.230
think of these as kind of
like miniature aloe veras.

00:11:41.230 --> 00:11:44.160
So it's filled with this
really nice, refreshing liquid

00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:47.370
that bursts with salt water
when you crunch into it.

00:11:47.370 --> 00:11:50.270
So I find it super addicting
to just snack on these

00:11:50.270 --> 00:11:51.540
by themselves.

00:11:51.540 --> 00:11:53.620
You can also throw
them onto a salad.

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:55.205
You can stir-fry them.

00:11:55.205 --> 00:11:58.040
You don't want to cook them
too long because then they

00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.960
lose that crunch that
makes them so special.

00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:05.170
So in this recipe, we're doing
a sea bean and soba salad.

00:12:05.170 --> 00:12:07.950
And the reason it's my
favorite way to eat these

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:11.610
is because soba noodles
are really silky and soft,

00:12:11.610 --> 00:12:14.860
and so it's really nice to
have them mixed with this kind

00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:20.740
of similar width item that has a
nice, different contrast to it.

00:12:20.740 --> 00:12:25.410
So to get started, we have
water boiling over here.

00:12:25.410 --> 00:12:28.470
So we're just going to
cook our soba noodles.

00:12:28.470 --> 00:12:31.970
And soba are actually--

00:12:31.970 --> 00:12:33.726
they're Japanese
buckwheat noodles.

00:12:33.726 --> 00:12:38.402
And if you have celiac disease,
or you're gluten-intolerant,

00:12:38.402 --> 00:12:40.370
buckwheat doesn't have
gluten, so they're

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:42.355
a nice gluten-free alternative.

00:12:42.355 --> 00:12:44.900
You just have to be sure that
you check the ingredient label,

00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:47.740
because a lot of soba noodles
that you find at grocery stores

00:12:47.740 --> 00:12:49.930
are actually mixed with wheat.

00:12:49.930 --> 00:12:52.242
I'm not sure about the
ones in this kitchen,

00:12:52.242 --> 00:12:53.980
but if you're cooking
these at home,

00:12:53.980 --> 00:12:58.950
just buy a package that
says "100% buckwheat."

00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:02.710
So with soba noodles, they
can get mushy very fast,

00:13:02.710 --> 00:13:04.621
and so it's very
important-- we're just

00:13:04.621 --> 00:13:05.870
going to put these in the pot.

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:11.470
It's very important to cook
them about a minute or two less

00:13:11.470 --> 00:13:12.880
than it says on the package.

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:14.690
Because I find if
you go the whole way,

00:13:14.690 --> 00:13:17.310
they always cook a little
longer after you take them out,

00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:19.410
even if you run them
under cold water.

00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:22.200
And they can get
mushy very fast.

00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:25.939
So typically that's maybe
for five to seven minutes you

00:13:25.939 --> 00:13:28.026
want to cook theses.

00:13:28.026 --> 00:13:29.900
Fortunately, we don't
have to wait that long.

00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:31.850
We have some already cooked.

00:13:31.850 --> 00:13:34.350
So what I do at home
is I drain these.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.470
I run them under cold water.

00:13:36.470 --> 00:13:39.390
And that helps stop the
cooking, but also it

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:41.390
washes off some of
that starch that-- you

00:13:41.390 --> 00:13:43.097
know when you cook
noodles and they sit,

00:13:43.097 --> 00:13:44.430
and they're in this, like, glob?

00:13:44.430 --> 00:13:45.900
So we don't want that.

00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.420
So you wash it off.

00:13:47.420 --> 00:13:52.355
And then I immediately
add the sesame oil.

00:13:52.355 --> 00:13:57.180
So the reason I do that is
because, one, it prevents them

00:13:57.180 --> 00:14:02.385
from sticking
together, and two, it--

00:14:02.385 --> 00:14:05.010
maybe this is in my head, but I
think it kind of creates, like,

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:07.150
a protective coating
around the noodle

00:14:07.150 --> 00:14:10.060
so that it doesn't continue
to soak up moisture and get

00:14:10.060 --> 00:14:12.610
soggier and soggier over time.

00:14:12.610 --> 00:14:15.090
So maybe that's-- like I
said, maybe I invented that,

00:14:15.090 --> 00:14:17.590
but I think it works.

00:14:17.590 --> 00:14:20.760
So you're just going to
kind of mix those up.

00:14:20.760 --> 00:14:23.020
And then I like this
salad pretty chilled,

00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.320
so I put this in the
fridge for about an hour

00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:28.629
or overnight if I'm
making this ahead of time.

00:14:28.629 --> 00:14:30.170
And then I pull it
out right when I'm

00:14:30.170 --> 00:14:32.440
ready to assemble the salad.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:35.250
So this is really easy dish.

00:14:35.250 --> 00:14:37.525
All we're going to do--
our sea beans are done.

00:14:37.525 --> 00:14:39.239
We don't have to do
anything to them.

00:14:39.239 --> 00:14:41.530
We're just going to add some
brightness and some crunch

00:14:41.530 --> 00:14:45.576
to the salad through
some green onion.

00:14:45.576 --> 00:14:47.520
So for green onions--

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.395
oh, they've already
removed the tops.

00:14:49.395 --> 00:14:51.270
So I don't really have
much to show you here.

00:14:51.270 --> 00:14:53.786
We're just going
to put these down.

00:14:53.786 --> 00:14:55.950
I can tell you a little
bit about knives.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:59.550
So use whatever knives
you're comfortable with.

00:14:59.550 --> 00:15:02.180
My favorite is this really
banged up nakiri knife.

00:15:02.180 --> 00:15:05.770
This is a knife specifically
designed for vegetables,

00:15:05.770 --> 00:15:07.330
and that's because it's--

00:15:07.330 --> 00:15:09.890
rather than a
chef's knife that's

00:15:09.890 --> 00:15:13.650
curved and is meant to be
used in a rocking motion,

00:15:13.650 --> 00:15:15.810
the nakiri knife is flat-edged.

00:15:15.810 --> 00:15:18.120
And so it's really just
an up-and-down knife.

00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:20.670
So you can kind of do that--

00:15:20.670 --> 00:15:22.687
across the cutting board
and chop really fast.

00:15:22.687 --> 00:15:25.785
And you don't end up getting
those strings of vegetables

00:15:25.785 --> 00:15:27.660
that are still attached
to each other, right?

00:15:27.660 --> 00:15:30.890
Like when you cut celery, and
then you take your knife away

00:15:30.890 --> 00:15:33.000
and you find they're
all still in a row.

00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:35.610
So I like this knife
because that doesn't happen.

00:15:35.610 --> 00:15:37.310
There are prettier
versions of this

00:15:37.310 --> 00:15:40.280
that aren't chipped and rusted,
but this is the one that I use.

00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.040
So we're just going to
run our knife through.

00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:50.110
And for the green
onion we use the white

00:15:50.110 --> 00:15:51.558
and the light-green parts.

00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:01.493
Has anyone ever cut themselves
on a filming of a Google food

00:16:01.493 --> 00:16:02.440
talk?

00:16:02.440 --> 00:16:04.950
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Yeah, we
have good editing, though.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:07.241
LAURA MCLIVELY: That would
be a chef's darkest moments,

00:16:07.241 --> 00:16:10.480
if you, like, cut off your
finger in one of these things.

00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:12.020
So we're going to chops those.

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.980
And then we are going
to use some chili.

00:16:13.980 --> 00:16:17.020
And you can use, again, whatever
peppers or chillies you like.

00:16:17.020 --> 00:16:18.520
I'm going to go
ahead and turn these

00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:20.895
off because, let's be honest,
this was just for the demo.

00:16:20.895 --> 00:16:22.754
We're not going to use those.

00:16:22.754 --> 00:16:24.670
You can use whatever
chili or pepper you like.

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:28.650
I like Fresno chilies because
they have the same heat

00:16:28.650 --> 00:16:30.040
level, similar to a jalapeno.

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.150
But they're red.

00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:32.836
So typically, when
you're cooking

00:16:32.836 --> 00:16:34.210
with a lot of
vegetables, there's

00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:35.668
a whole lot of
green in there, so I

00:16:35.668 --> 00:16:39.024
like to seek out chilies
to add some color.

00:16:39.024 --> 00:16:41.410
So the easiest way
to slice a chili

00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:46.790
is to just slice the
chili off of the seed.

00:16:46.790 --> 00:16:48.270
But then you end up with strips.

00:16:48.270 --> 00:16:50.640
So if you want julienne
it, that's fine.

00:16:50.640 --> 00:16:52.740
For this salad, we're
going to slice it

00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:55.450
in rounds just because it
looks a little prettier.

00:16:55.450 --> 00:16:59.585
So what you can do is you just
slice up until about halfway

00:16:59.585 --> 00:17:00.460
when the seeds start.

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:11.490
And then, once you see seeds,
you can take a little melon

00:17:11.490 --> 00:17:15.970
baller or a small spoon, and--
this is my little compost

00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:16.810
pile--

00:17:16.810 --> 00:17:20.060
and just scoop out the seeds.

00:17:20.060 --> 00:17:25.369
And that way, you get rounds but
without the white pit and the--

00:17:25.369 --> 00:17:27.625
or the white membranes
and the seeds.

00:17:27.625 --> 00:17:29.365
The seeds are where
all the heat is,

00:17:29.365 --> 00:17:32.070
so if you want some
of that extra heat,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:35.010
you can keep a couple
and throw them in there.

00:17:35.010 --> 00:17:39.932
But I usually cut them out
so that it doesn't upset

00:17:39.932 --> 00:17:42.802
people who aren't spice lovers.

00:17:42.802 --> 00:17:44.980
So then it's pretty
fragile because you've

00:17:44.980 --> 00:17:45.980
removed the seeds.

00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:49.095
So you want to be careful if
you are using a chef's knife,

00:17:49.095 --> 00:17:52.020
that you don't just crush it
and open up the nice disc.

00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.250
So you just want to be
a little more careful

00:17:54.250 --> 00:17:58.400
and maybe slice so
that they stay intact.

00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:04.330
So there you go.

00:18:04.330 --> 00:18:07.400
You have your cut chili.

00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:09.860
So we're going to
actually add a cup.

00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.252
And they've already
pre-sliced these for me.

00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:17.900
And then they
pre-sliced my onions.

00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:20.100
Just [INAUDIBLE] things.

00:18:20.100 --> 00:18:22.370
And then they pre-sliced
my Thai chili.

00:18:22.370 --> 00:18:24.480
So I love-- sorry,
not Thai chili.

00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:25.270
Thai basil.

00:18:25.270 --> 00:18:26.520
I love all kinds of basil.

00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:29.150
And in my garden, sometimes
this one looks funky,

00:18:29.150 --> 00:18:30.409
and I use the regular basil.

00:18:30.409 --> 00:18:31.450
It doesn't really matter.

00:18:31.450 --> 00:18:33.320
But if you're trying
to keep this kind

00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:39.660
of a Southeast Asian dish, you
could go with the Thai basil.

00:18:39.660 --> 00:18:42.430
And then while this
is kind of sitting

00:18:42.430 --> 00:18:45.820
over there doing nothing, we
want to toast our sesame seeds.

00:18:45.820 --> 00:18:49.910
So I usually use
black sesame seeds.

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:50.963
How do I turn this on?

00:18:50.963 --> 00:18:51.838
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:51.838 --> 00:18:53.525
LAURA MCLIVELY: Hold it down.

00:18:53.525 --> 00:18:55.093
SPEAKER: And now go ahead and--

00:18:55.093 --> 00:18:56.176
LAURA MCLIVELY: Go up, OK.

00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:03.730
So I like using the black
sesame seeds because they just

00:19:03.730 --> 00:19:05.830
provide such a nice contrast.

00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:07.287
You can see them
better on dishes.

00:19:07.287 --> 00:19:09.472
Did I do that right?

00:19:09.472 --> 00:19:12.467
Oh, I'm using the wrong burner.

00:19:12.467 --> 00:19:14.034
SPEAKER: That's
actually a timer.

00:19:14.034 --> 00:19:16.450
LAURA MCLIVELY: That's what
was beeping over there.

00:19:16.450 --> 00:19:18.700
I was like, why is this
pan not getting hot?

00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:19.980
SPEAKER: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:19:19.980 --> 00:19:21.573
LAURA MCLIVELY: Yes, thank you.

00:19:21.573 --> 00:19:23.950
Black sesame seeds
just look so pretty.

00:19:23.950 --> 00:19:26.090
And again, I think it's
one of those things that

00:19:26.090 --> 00:19:27.710
are underutilized in kitchens.

00:19:27.710 --> 00:19:31.320
Oftentime, you see sesame
seeds on breads or pastries

00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:33.900
and on salads, and it's
always the golden ones.

00:19:33.900 --> 00:19:36.730
And so once again, just even
if you just go to the store

00:19:36.730 --> 00:19:39.299
and pick out a different
spice or something

00:19:39.299 --> 00:19:40.840
different from the
bulk bins, I think

00:19:40.840 --> 00:19:43.050
you end up realizing
how versatile it is

00:19:43.050 --> 00:19:44.297
and how much fun you'd have.

00:19:44.297 --> 00:19:47.110
One of the things I'd love
to do with black sesame seeds

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:48.450
is to make tahini.

00:19:48.450 --> 00:19:50.430
So we've all seen
tahini, and it's

00:19:50.430 --> 00:19:52.475
kind of peanut-butter looking.

00:19:52.475 --> 00:19:54.600
My husband is definitely
allergic to peanut butter,

00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:57.179
so I tend to keep things
away from the house that

00:19:57.179 --> 00:19:59.470
even remotely look like it
because he's just like, ugh,

00:19:59.470 --> 00:20:01.640
what is that?

00:20:01.640 --> 00:20:04.320
So usually I buy
black sesame seeds,

00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:05.650
and I make that into a tahini.

00:20:05.650 --> 00:20:08.860
And it's really
glossy and beautiful.

00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:12.320
And in fact, it's in one of
the recipes for treviso spring

00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:12.820
rolls.

00:20:12.820 --> 00:20:14.960
So kind of like a
Vietnamese-style fresh spring

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:15.460
roll.

00:20:15.460 --> 00:20:18.390
And you dip it in the
black tahini afterwards.

00:20:18.390 --> 00:20:21.290
Which, I see treviso out
there in your kitchen,

00:20:21.290 --> 00:20:23.880
so I'm glad to see some of
the items in this cookbook

00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:25.945
out there.

00:20:25.945 --> 00:20:27.570
So to test the sesame
seeds, we're just

00:20:27.570 --> 00:20:30.171
going to add them to the pan.

00:20:30.171 --> 00:20:33.070
And this takes about a
minute or two for them

00:20:33.070 --> 00:20:36.070
to start to smell fragrant.

00:20:36.070 --> 00:20:37.570
You don't want them
to burn, so just

00:20:37.570 --> 00:20:39.640
kind of shake your pan
every once in a while,

00:20:39.640 --> 00:20:41.620
and make sure that
they're moving around.

00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:44.220
And when they smell [INAUDIBLE],,
take them off and let

00:20:44.220 --> 00:20:47.760
them cool so that they don't
continue to cook in the pan.

00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:51.630
Because there's nothing worse
than burned seeds and nuts,

00:20:51.630 --> 00:20:53.330
right?

00:20:53.330 --> 00:20:55.552
So give those a little shake.

00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:00.745
And then we're just going
to make our dressing.

00:21:00.745 --> 00:21:06.879
So for our dressing, we
have some minced ginger.

00:21:06.879 --> 00:21:08.745
I'm being a messy cook.

00:21:08.745 --> 00:21:10.786
Let me move these
out of the way.

00:21:10.786 --> 00:21:17.860
We're going to do some fresh,
minced ginger, some soy sauce.

00:21:17.860 --> 00:21:20.500
And again, if you're keeping
this recipe gluten-free

00:21:20.500 --> 00:21:23.410
by buying 100%
buckwheat noodles,

00:21:23.410 --> 00:21:25.420
you could also
use tamari instead

00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:28.936
because that's the gluten-free
alternative to soy sauce.

00:21:28.936 --> 00:21:34.360
So lime juice and our honey.

00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:36.550
So typically in
Southeast Asian cooking,

00:21:36.550 --> 00:21:40.420
you're aiming for a nice balance
between salt, acid, and sweet.

00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:43.120
Or really in all
cooking, really.

00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:45.620
But particularly in
Southeast Asian cooking,

00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:47.970
you want a little bit
of sweetness and lots

00:21:47.970 --> 00:21:50.670
of acid and some
salt. And so that's

00:21:50.670 --> 00:21:53.460
why we're adding the honey,
is for that sweetness.

00:21:53.460 --> 00:22:00.640
And last but not least,
our rice vinegar.

00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:05.905
And actually, I hear my
little sesame seeds popping.

00:22:05.905 --> 00:22:06.871
Yep.

00:22:06.871 --> 00:22:08.954
So you just want to kind
of stick your nose in it,

00:22:08.954 --> 00:22:14.110
and when it smells
done, it's done.

00:22:14.110 --> 00:22:15.102
OK.

00:22:15.102 --> 00:22:19.566
So we're just going
to whisk this up.

00:22:19.566 --> 00:22:21.054
And dump it on.

00:22:27.998 --> 00:22:30.570
And last but not least, we're
going to add our sea beans.

00:22:30.570 --> 00:22:32.140
So, like I said,
you don't really

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:33.450
have to do anything to these.

00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.400
They're best
chilled, because they

00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:40.575
can get kind of, like, limp
if they're out too long.

00:22:40.575 --> 00:22:43.500
And really, you can just
put them in as they are,

00:22:43.500 --> 00:22:45.350
but if you have some
that are really long--

00:22:45.350 --> 00:22:47.420
these are actually pretty tiny.

00:22:47.420 --> 00:22:48.597
But some of these are long.

00:22:48.597 --> 00:22:50.180
And so let's say
you're having someone

00:22:50.180 --> 00:22:53.290
over, like your special friend,
and you're cooking for them.

00:22:53.290 --> 00:22:55.400
You don't want mouthfuls
of succulent tentacles

00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.640
falling out of your mouth.

00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:00.140
So you can put them
on your cutting board,

00:23:00.140 --> 00:23:01.960
and maybe run a knife
through it once.

00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.501
You don't want to
chop them up a lot,

00:23:03.501 --> 00:23:05.440
but just kind of do one
in half so that there

00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:09.274
are more bite-sized pieces.

00:23:09.274 --> 00:23:10.355
So we'll just add this.

00:23:10.355 --> 00:23:14.760
And this bowl is going to
be really hard to toss in.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.770
Maybe I should have made
that my compost bowl.

00:23:17.770 --> 00:23:19.780
Let's just pretend this
chili is not in here.

00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.088
Thank you.

00:23:26.088 --> 00:23:27.912
Perfect.

00:23:27.912 --> 00:23:30.816
Let's see how many bowls we
can dirty in the kitchen.

00:23:35.298 --> 00:23:39.092
So we'll just give
this a quick toss.

00:23:39.092 --> 00:23:41.980
And then I want to put
it in something pretty,

00:23:41.980 --> 00:23:43.750
and they gave me a
really nice [INAUDIBLE]

00:23:43.750 --> 00:23:49.015
that has a good
color contrast to it.

00:23:49.015 --> 00:23:51.361
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
Would you typically want

00:23:51.361 --> 00:23:52.860
to serve this
immediately, or do you

00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:54.510
find that it does
a little better

00:23:54.510 --> 00:23:56.880
with a little bit of
time in the refrigerator?

00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:00.140
LAURA MCLIVELY: I like to serve
it immediately so that the soba

00:24:00.140 --> 00:24:05.300
noodles don't get too soggy,
and also the sea beans

00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.650
are really [INAUDIBLE]
chill, so just kind

00:24:07.650 --> 00:24:09.010
of toss it and serve it.

00:24:09.010 --> 00:24:12.559
But, that being said, I
always make extra and take it

00:24:12.559 --> 00:24:14.850
for lunch in a Tupperware
the next day, and it's great.

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:16.400
It just kind of lose--

00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.410
like the Thai basil will
be a little more bruised,

00:24:19.410 --> 00:24:21.190
and it just won't
look quite as nice.

00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:22.731
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
So spoiler alert.

00:24:22.731 --> 00:24:25.579
Before we started the filming,
chef was having lunch,

00:24:25.579 --> 00:24:27.120
and this is what
she was eating, so I

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:28.130
know it's one of her favorites.

00:24:28.130 --> 00:24:29.046
LAURA MCLIVELY: It is.

00:24:29.046 --> 00:24:31.225
Actually, so there's about 100--

00:24:31.225 --> 00:24:34.122
just sprinkling the toasted
sesame seeds on top.

00:24:34.122 --> 00:24:38.744
There's about 100 unique
fruits and vegetables

00:24:38.744 --> 00:24:39.660
featured in this book.

00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:42.550
I don't like to say exotic,
because exotic to me

00:24:42.550 --> 00:24:44.830
is normal to someone else.

00:24:44.830 --> 00:24:47.590
So there's 100 unique fruits
and vegetables in this book

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:50.160
that I took home to play
with for the first time

00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:51.760
and develop these recipes.

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:53.786
And of all of them,
I think sea beans

00:24:53.786 --> 00:24:58.290
are my favorite new friend,
or at least in my top 10.

00:24:58.290 --> 00:25:01.400
So I hope that you
leave here today--

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:03.960
I guess my ultimate hope is
that you leave here today

00:25:03.960 --> 00:25:06.780
excited to pick up
that thing that you've

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.230
seen at the farmer's market
or at that ethic grocery

00:25:09.230 --> 00:25:11.240
store on the corner,
and kind of marveled

00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:13.710
at but not felt
comfortable taking home--

00:25:13.710 --> 00:25:15.090
I hope you bring it home.

00:25:15.090 --> 00:25:17.400
And just think, there's
probably a new best friend

00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:18.962
that you haven't discovered yet.

00:25:18.962 --> 00:25:20.420
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
It looks great.

00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:22.260
LAURA MCLIVELY: The
sea beans and soba.

00:25:22.260 --> 00:25:23.310
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
These will be served

00:25:23.310 --> 00:25:24.840
a little later after the demo.

00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:26.114
I want to highlight--

00:25:26.114 --> 00:25:27.780
just I was looking
over the ingredients.

00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:31.350
This salad is super exciting
not just visually, but obviously

00:25:31.350 --> 00:25:32.430
when you taste it.

00:25:32.430 --> 00:25:34.560
And being at Google, we
serve salads at almost all

00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:35.310
of our cafes.

00:25:35.310 --> 00:25:37.170
And so one of the
things that I look

00:25:37.170 --> 00:25:38.910
at when we are
looking for really

00:25:38.910 --> 00:25:40.980
crave-able,
plant-forward salads,

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.960
is how do you get someone
to want to come back

00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:43.920
for that second bite.

00:25:43.920 --> 00:25:46.710
And if you think about this,
visually it's stunning,

00:25:46.710 --> 00:25:48.965
but it also has a lot
of elements in there

00:25:48.965 --> 00:25:51.090
that are going to kind of
tease that palate, right?

00:25:51.090 --> 00:25:52.506
You've got all
that umami in there

00:25:52.506 --> 00:25:53.814
from the soy sauce, the chili.

00:25:53.814 --> 00:25:55.230
So there's a lot
of great elements

00:25:55.230 --> 00:25:59.450
that I think you're
going to extremely enjoy.

00:25:59.450 --> 00:26:00.630
LAURA MCLIVELY: Thank you.

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:02.920
Yeah, this could be one
that you guys serve up

00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:05.130
and have as a standing
salad in your kitchen.

00:26:05.130 --> 00:26:05.615
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Love it.

00:26:05.615 --> 00:26:07.073
LAURA MCLIVELY:
Feel free to steal.

00:26:11.377 --> 00:26:13.762
OK.

00:26:13.762 --> 00:26:17.300
So our last recipe we're
going to demonstrate

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:20.990
is lemongrass coconut ice cream.

00:26:20.990 --> 00:26:24.823
So I realize that most of you
have had lemongrass by now.

00:26:24.823 --> 00:26:28.760
It's not so much an
obscure ingredient.

00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:33.760
But I still think
that I've met--

00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:38.120
a lot of my friends and a lot
of fellow cooks I know still

00:26:38.120 --> 00:26:39.460
haven't worked with it.

00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:41.340
It's like we have it
in Southeast Asian

00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:44.300
cooking when we go to a Thai
restaurant, but a lot of people

00:26:44.300 --> 00:26:46.490
haven't actually
prepared it at home.

00:26:46.490 --> 00:26:48.549
So once again, it's
like making these things

00:26:48.549 --> 00:26:50.465
kind of familiar parts
of our everyday cooking

00:26:50.465 --> 00:26:54.500
can really add some variety and
fun and a sense of discovery

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.380
in the kitchen.

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.150
At least that's
what it did for me.

00:26:57.150 --> 00:27:00.880
So coconut-based ice cream
is my favorite, because--

00:27:00.880 --> 00:27:04.360
I do eat regular ice cream
too, but the cool thing

00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:06.955
about coconut ice
cream is you can--

00:27:06.955 --> 00:27:09.650
something's beeping
again, the timer-- you

00:27:09.650 --> 00:27:10.955
can have it a moment's notice.

00:27:10.955 --> 00:27:12.330
Rarely do I keep
large quantities

00:27:12.330 --> 00:27:14.990
of cream just sitting
in my refrigerator,

00:27:14.990 --> 00:27:18.380
but I always have a can or two
of coconut milk in my cabinet.

00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.830
And so you can have ice
cream instantaneously.

00:27:20.830 --> 00:27:22.660
All you need is an
ice-cream maker.

00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:26.280
So usually the
coconut-based ice cream,

00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:28.190
you just want to add
something to flavor it.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:34.470
And I love lemongrass because
it has that really nice zingy,

00:27:34.470 --> 00:27:35.650
citrus-y taste.

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:37.575
Like it actually kind
of zings in your mouth.

00:27:37.575 --> 00:27:40.005
And even a hint of pepperiness,
sort of like ginger.

00:27:40.005 --> 00:27:45.000
And so it's a nice way to cut
the richness of pure coconut

00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.040
milk that has a
high fat content.

00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:51.425
You do want to use real regular
coconut milk, not light,

00:27:51.425 --> 00:27:53.980
so that you get a
nice creamy ice cream.

00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.620
So all we're going to do
is prepare lemongrass.

00:27:56.620 --> 00:27:58.850
I hope you're seeing how
easy these recipes are.

00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.365
It is very approachable.

00:28:00.365 --> 00:28:02.140
So things that might
look intimidating

00:28:02.140 --> 00:28:05.420
are actually quite easy
once you get used to them.

00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.330
So what we're going to do is
just slice off our root tip.

00:28:12.330 --> 00:28:15.640
And then I like to bruise
them sort of like you would

00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:17.970
garlic to release the layers.

00:28:17.970 --> 00:28:20.370
And also it helps break
down the cell walls

00:28:20.370 --> 00:28:25.116
and get that lemongrass
oil infusing and releasing

00:28:25.116 --> 00:28:26.710
from the layer.

00:28:26.710 --> 00:28:27.774
So you could just take--

00:28:27.774 --> 00:28:29.940
I don't want to use my
really fragile nakiri knife--

00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:33.690
you can take a chef's knife
and just kind of whack it

00:28:33.690 --> 00:28:37.340
with your hand along the stalk.

00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:39.540
And then we're just
going to slice it.

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:40.850
It doesn't have be precise.

00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:45.000
This is just to create
some surface area

00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:46.402
for the coconut milk.

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:53.520
This is basically a two or
three-ingredient ice cream,

00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:56.520
depending on whether or
not you want to add ginger.

00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:00.195
So it's kind of as
simple as making vanilla.

00:29:00.195 --> 00:29:02.480
So you can use as much
of it as you want.

00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:07.160
I kind of stop once I get up to
the part where it branches off.

00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:12.906
And then we're going
to repeat that.

00:29:12.906 --> 00:29:16.793
If there's some layers
that look kind of--

00:29:16.793 --> 00:29:18.660
you know how onion
or celery or fennel

00:29:18.660 --> 00:29:20.719
have some of those outer,
brownish layers that

00:29:20.719 --> 00:29:22.260
look like they've
touched everything?

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:24.510
You can remove an
outer layer like that,

00:29:24.510 --> 00:29:27.114
and then do your bruising.

00:29:27.114 --> 00:29:28.530
This one looks fine.

00:29:33.730 --> 00:29:36.430
If you have delicate hands,
you can use, like, a--

00:29:36.430 --> 00:29:39.250
my mom has a wooden mortar
and pestle on her counter.

00:29:39.250 --> 00:29:42.140
And she always just
took the actual mortar

00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.368
and banged it on her
garlic or whatever.

00:29:59.038 --> 00:30:00.510
And here's our last stalk.

00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:05.910
I used three because I
like it quite lemony.

00:30:05.910 --> 00:30:08.860
And also, this is growing
in the Google garden.

00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:11.980
So you guys are growing
a lot of these things.

00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:16.410
I have this growing at home, but
mine is kind of spindly still.

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:18.084
It's not big enough.

00:30:21.006 --> 00:30:22.960
OK.

00:30:22.960 --> 00:30:26.929
So making this ice cream
is as simple as putting

00:30:26.929 --> 00:30:28.201
this in a pot.

00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:36.640
And you're going to
add your coconut milk.

00:30:36.640 --> 00:30:38.820
They have these huge
industrial-sized cans

00:30:38.820 --> 00:30:42.295
of coconut milk in this kitchen,
so that's why it's pre-poured.

00:30:42.295 --> 00:30:45.308
But at home, this would
be about two cans.

00:30:48.182 --> 00:30:51.850
So we've got our coconut
milk and our sugar.

00:30:55.130 --> 00:30:59.110
And like I said, if you'd
like, you can add some ginger.

00:30:59.110 --> 00:31:03.400
I just add a couple
coins, three or four.

00:31:07.540 --> 00:31:09.050
And you just heat it.

00:31:09.050 --> 00:31:14.818
So you put this on your stove,
if I can work this burner.

00:31:14.818 --> 00:31:18.290
This one, on.

00:31:18.290 --> 00:31:20.640
And the goal is just
to get it to the point

00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:22.383
where it's simmering,
because since this

00:31:22.383 --> 00:31:25.240
is sort of an infusion,
you're really just wanting

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.810
to treat it like a tea.

00:31:26.810 --> 00:31:29.600
So get the coconut
milk to simmer,

00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:33.480
and then you can turn
it off and let it sit.

00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.876
So what I do is I,
once it's simmering,

00:31:36.876 --> 00:31:39.830
I let it sit for about
15 minutes in the pot

00:31:39.830 --> 00:31:42.140
that I'm simmering
it in so that it's

00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.850
infusing at its maximum heat.

00:31:44.850 --> 00:31:48.520
And then you take this mixture,
and you want to chill it.

00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:50.810
Because when you're
making ice cream,

00:31:50.810 --> 00:31:52.730
it's really important
that the solution

00:31:52.730 --> 00:31:54.479
that you're putting
in the ice-cream maker

00:31:54.479 --> 00:31:56.210
is as cold as possible.

00:31:56.210 --> 00:31:58.900
Because if it takes
too long to freeze,

00:31:58.900 --> 00:32:00.860
you end up getting ice crystals.

00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:05.120
So I usually will kind of
make this up the night before

00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:06.540
and keep it in my fridge.

00:32:06.540 --> 00:32:09.350
And then when we're
sitting down for dinner,

00:32:09.350 --> 00:32:10.910
I throw this in my
ice-cream maker.

00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:12.670
It takes about 15 to
20 minutes to freeze,

00:32:12.670 --> 00:32:15.240
and it's done by the time
we finish our dinner.

00:32:15.240 --> 00:32:16.606
I feel there's nothing--

00:32:16.606 --> 00:32:20.010
it's a really nice touch
to serve homemade ice cream

00:32:20.010 --> 00:32:21.950
when you're having people over.

00:32:21.950 --> 00:32:23.690
And they think it's
like this big deal,

00:32:23.690 --> 00:32:25.940
but it's really super simple.

00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:27.940
And so it's a nice way
to serve people something

00:32:27.940 --> 00:32:30.630
that seems special but that
doesn't take a lot of time.

00:32:30.630 --> 00:32:34.430
So I don't think we'll we
for this to actually simmer,

00:32:34.430 --> 00:32:38.810
but let's just pretend it's
simmered, we've chilled it.

00:32:38.810 --> 00:32:42.020
And if you want to chill
it fast, not in your fridge

00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:44.075
overnight, you could
just set up a ice bath.

00:32:44.075 --> 00:32:47.430
So put a bowl in a
larger bowl of ice

00:32:47.430 --> 00:32:49.690
and kind of let it
sit there and stir it.

00:32:49.690 --> 00:32:52.210
That will take maybe 30
minutes to get it to the point

00:32:52.210 --> 00:32:53.730
where it's really chilled.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:56.370
And then-- I don't think I
have an ice-cream maker here,

00:32:56.370 --> 00:32:57.203
but they've used it.

00:32:57.203 --> 00:32:59.530
But you would turn on
your ice-cream maker.

00:32:59.530 --> 00:33:02.590
And in the interest of not
dirtying extra equipment,

00:33:02.590 --> 00:33:05.940
I just hold a strainer,
a fine-mesh strainer,

00:33:05.940 --> 00:33:08.660
over the ice-cream maker,
and I dump it directly in.

00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.910
And it keeps out the solids.

00:33:10.910 --> 00:33:13.380
So we basically want to leave
the lemongrass and ginger

00:33:13.380 --> 00:33:18.470
in there as long as possible so
that it's infusing to the max.

00:33:18.470 --> 00:33:20.530
So that's it for
the cooking part,

00:33:20.530 --> 00:33:22.050
but hopefully that
leaves some time

00:33:22.050 --> 00:33:24.435
to see if you guys
know your stuff

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:26.188
and can identify
some of these things.

00:33:26.188 --> 00:33:27.562
And then we can
talk a little bit

00:33:27.562 --> 00:33:31.340
about the inspiration behind
the book and Berkeley Bowl

00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:32.290
and things like that.

00:33:32.290 --> 00:33:32.750
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Awesome.

00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:33.620
Round of applause.

00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:34.703
LAURA MCLIVELY: Thank you.

00:33:34.703 --> 00:33:36.777
[APPLAUSE]

00:33:36.777 --> 00:33:39.270
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So for
those of you on the video,

00:33:39.270 --> 00:33:43.120
you can't smell the
amazing essences in here,

00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:45.340
but you will be tasting
the food shortly.

00:33:45.340 --> 00:33:47.400
So we will be
opening it up to Q&amp;A,

00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:48.870
which we can start at any time.

00:33:48.870 --> 00:33:52.142
I know that Laura has
her personal cookbook

00:33:52.142 --> 00:33:54.100
up there that we're
reminding you to take home.

00:33:54.100 --> 00:33:54.840
LAURA MCLIVELY: Oh
yeah, thank you.

00:33:54.840 --> 00:33:56.130
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: As well
as some other ingredients

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.050
that you may want to
discuss a little bit.

00:33:58.050 --> 00:33:59.633
And then we'll go
into some questions.

00:33:59.633 --> 00:34:01.767
So if you have things
that are on your mind,

00:34:01.767 --> 00:34:03.600
if there are specifics
within the book you'd

00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:06.000
like to learn more
about, we have probably

00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.730
about 25 minutes before we
go into the book signing.

00:34:08.730 --> 00:34:11.330
So think about those questions.

00:34:11.330 --> 00:34:14.159
And I will kick it off with
just some general questions

00:34:14.159 --> 00:34:16.060
that I had, which is--

00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:18.922
we get this a lot as chefs--
how did you get into cooking?

00:34:18.922 --> 00:34:22.230
LAURA MCLIVELY: So
I always grew up

00:34:22.230 --> 00:34:25.350
in a household where people
were cooking all the time.

00:34:25.350 --> 00:34:27.320
So my mom, she was from Spain.

00:34:27.320 --> 00:34:30.280
And my dad's family
was from Greece.

00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:34.909
So we just always had good
plant-based food at home.

00:34:34.909 --> 00:34:39.120
We weren't raised vegetarian,
but we rarely ate meat.

00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:42.449
It was maybe for, like,
Thanksgiving or something.

00:34:42.449 --> 00:34:46.409
And so I was around a lot
of produce and vegetables.

00:34:46.409 --> 00:34:49.300
And then I also lived
in Spain for a while.

00:34:49.300 --> 00:34:52.320
And so I think just
seeing how food

00:34:52.320 --> 00:34:56.936
is such a way to bring people
together, and also a way to--

00:34:56.936 --> 00:34:59.652
a statement that you can
make about how you're

00:34:59.652 --> 00:35:01.110
caring for the
world and how you're

00:35:01.110 --> 00:35:04.080
caring for your own body, that
I just really got into it.

00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.120
So I did study
nutritional science.

00:35:06.120 --> 00:35:10.170
I'm a registered dietitian
by day at the Native American

00:35:10.170 --> 00:35:12.060
Health Center in
Oakland and also

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.310
in the Mission District
in San Francisco.

00:35:14.310 --> 00:35:17.580
So I deal with food in
kind of a clinical context,

00:35:17.580 --> 00:35:22.410
but I really enjoy
just kind of the art

00:35:22.410 --> 00:35:25.270
of playing with food at home.

00:35:25.270 --> 00:35:26.520
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Very cool.

00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.020
I know I asked this
question earlier,

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.090
but just going back
to the Berkeley

00:35:29.090 --> 00:35:31.440
Bowl-- who has not been to
the Berkeley Bowl before?

00:35:33.950 --> 00:35:35.290
And I'm not singling anyone out.

00:35:35.290 --> 00:35:36.581
You can't see on camera anyway.

00:35:36.581 --> 00:35:38.690
But there's some cool
fun facts about the Bowl.

00:35:38.690 --> 00:35:40.260
So it used to be
a bowling alley.

00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:43.480
It's owned by a husband and
wife, and now their son.

00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:46.079
They've owned it
for several decades.

00:35:46.079 --> 00:35:47.370
There's two locations, correct?

00:35:47.370 --> 00:35:48.097
LAURA MCLIVELY: Mm-hmm.

00:35:48.097 --> 00:35:49.260
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: And you
said there was over, what,

00:35:49.260 --> 00:35:51.840
1,000-plus different
ingredients in there?

00:35:51.840 --> 00:35:52.743
LAURA MCLIVELY: Yes.

00:35:52.743 --> 00:35:56.460
So for those who haven't been,
the reason this store can

00:35:56.460 --> 00:35:58.174
inspire a whole cookbook--

00:35:58.174 --> 00:35:59.590
I don't work for
them, by the way.

00:35:59.590 --> 00:36:01.120
A lot of people think I do.

00:36:01.120 --> 00:36:04.000
I'm just a shopper who
was inspired by the store.

00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.530
And it's because
it's hard to find

00:36:07.530 --> 00:36:12.080
another place that has so many
produce items under one roof.

00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:13.945
This book is usable
even if you don't

00:36:13.945 --> 00:36:15.570
live next to Berkeley
Bowl because it's

00:36:15.570 --> 00:36:18.060
kind of like a fun
treasure map to go find

00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.740
these things at a
certain farmer's market,

00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:24.240
and then maybe you go find
nopales at the Hispanic market.

00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.390
And then you can find burdock
root at the Asian market.

00:36:27.390 --> 00:36:29.620
But you'd have to go to a
lot of different places.

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:31.706
And that's fun in its own right.

00:36:31.706 --> 00:36:33.300
But the cool thing
about Berkeley Bowl

00:36:33.300 --> 00:36:35.910
is all those things
are under one roof.

00:36:35.910 --> 00:36:41.370
And that's because Glenn
Yasuda, the original owner,

00:36:41.370 --> 00:36:42.520
his family were farmers.

00:36:42.520 --> 00:36:47.220
And Diane, his wife, her family
owned another produce shop

00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:48.270
in Berkeley.

00:36:48.270 --> 00:36:51.970
And they really had this
dream of opening a produce

00:36:51.970 --> 00:36:54.210
store in front of the
house where they lived,

00:36:54.210 --> 00:36:55.740
sort of like things
are in Japan.

00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:57.805
And so they bought
this bowling alley

00:36:57.805 --> 00:36:59.180
that was in front
of their house,

00:36:59.180 --> 00:37:00.810
and they turned it
into a produce shop.

00:37:00.810 --> 00:37:02.940
So originally, it
was just produce.

00:37:02.940 --> 00:37:06.120
And he has always had
this commitment to,

00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.090
if I can find it,
I will provide it.

00:37:08.090 --> 00:37:10.760
And knowing that he
has this store in one

00:37:10.760 --> 00:37:13.945
of the most culturally
diverse areas in the country,

00:37:13.945 --> 00:37:18.710
with over 112 languages
spoken in the Bay Area,

00:37:18.710 --> 00:37:22.430
he kind of knew, well, if I
can find this niche item, if I

00:37:22.430 --> 00:37:24.640
can find taro
leaf, there will be

00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.742
someone that is
excited to see taro

00:37:26.742 --> 00:37:28.350
leaf at their local market.

00:37:28.350 --> 00:37:29.620
And he was right.

00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:31.272
He kept finding
these niche items

00:37:31.272 --> 00:37:33.210
and providing more
and more and more.

00:37:33.210 --> 00:37:34.800
And more and more
people came, knowing

00:37:34.800 --> 00:37:36.480
that they could
find the foods that

00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:39.950
maybe were from their cultural
background, all in one spot.

00:37:39.950 --> 00:37:45.410
By the way, this is simmering,
so we're going to turn it off.

00:37:45.410 --> 00:37:48.230
So when I first set
foot in Berkeley Bowl,

00:37:48.230 --> 00:37:50.040
I saw things like this.

00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:56.020
And granted, this
is a room with a lot

00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.770
of people from maybe
different backgrounds

00:37:57.770 --> 00:38:00.290
as well, so some of these
things might be normal to you.

00:38:00.290 --> 00:38:03.800
Like Scott was saying
his wife is Fijian.

00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:10.340
And so she grew up eating
Indian bitter melon.

00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:13.094
But maybe she didn't grow
up eating salad savoy.

00:38:13.094 --> 00:38:15.510
And so it's kind of cool because
you can go to this store,

00:38:15.510 --> 00:38:17.280
and you're always
going to find something

00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:18.890
that you don't recognize.

00:38:18.890 --> 00:38:22.412
But when I walked in, I saw
these things, like this--

00:38:22.412 --> 00:38:26.080
this one's kind of a small one,
but these can get up to, like,

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:27.200
3 or 4 feet, this root.

00:38:27.200 --> 00:38:29.241
And I'm picking it up,
like, what I do with this?

00:38:29.241 --> 00:38:32.250
Like, oh, my god,
this is so cool!

00:38:32.250 --> 00:38:34.734
And so again, I kind of would
ask people that were also

00:38:34.734 --> 00:38:35.900
picking it up, what is this?

00:38:35.900 --> 00:38:37.169
What does it taste like?

00:38:37.169 --> 00:38:38.960
And then ultimately
kind of got the courage

00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:42.000
to bring these home
and experiment.

00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.923
So usually I'd bring
it home, and I'd

00:38:43.923 --> 00:38:45.340
try it a couple
of different ways.

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:49.740
Like, I'd grate it, I'd cook
it, I'd braise it, I'd roast it.

00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:52.270
And then I'd see what
way I liked the best.

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.933
And I tried to do that
before looking it up,

00:38:54.933 --> 00:39:00.110
because it's really easy to kind
of pigeon hole an ingredient

00:39:00.110 --> 00:39:03.050
into a certain context, like,
oh, this has to be prepared--

00:39:03.050 --> 00:39:05.089
like this is typically--

00:39:05.089 --> 00:39:07.130
well, it's used a lot of
different ways in Japan,

00:39:07.130 --> 00:39:13.400
but oftentimes it's grated and
simmered in a sweet solution,

00:39:13.400 --> 00:39:15.241
and it's used as a
topping on things.

00:39:15.241 --> 00:39:17.240
So it's like, well, I
don't want to repeat that,

00:39:17.240 --> 00:39:21.810
so I try to play with these
things before looking them up

00:39:21.810 --> 00:39:26.380
and come up with my own ways
and my own family dishes

00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:28.420
to incorporate them into.

00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:30.820
So there's a lot of Spanish
and Greek dishes in this book

00:39:30.820 --> 00:39:32.450
because that was my background.

00:39:32.450 --> 00:39:35.120
And then also a
lot of dishes that

00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:38.195
were inspired by travels,
and just living in Berkeley

00:39:38.195 --> 00:39:39.842
and eating out.

00:39:39.842 --> 00:39:42.050
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So before
the food comes to you--

00:39:42.050 --> 00:39:44.240
and they're plating it up now-
are there additional questions?

00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:46.406
Anyone have anything they
want to ask at this point?

00:39:46.406 --> 00:39:49.840
Because I will keep
talking, if not.

00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.755
Yes?

00:39:50.755 --> 00:39:53.230
AUDIENCE: Do you have
a go-to blog or site

00:39:53.230 --> 00:39:57.190
or anything that tells you
kind of how to pick produce?

00:39:57.190 --> 00:39:59.775
Because it's cool to see a
bunch of different options,

00:39:59.775 --> 00:40:01.650
but I have no idea how
to pick the right one.

00:40:01.650 --> 00:40:03.858
LAURA MCLIVELY: Yeah, that's
a really great question.

00:40:03.858 --> 00:40:05.790
So she asked if I
have a go-to resource

00:40:05.790 --> 00:40:11.616
for learning how to select
and work with produce, right?

00:40:11.616 --> 00:40:13.490
Well, first of all, I
forgot to mention that,

00:40:13.490 --> 00:40:15.340
so I'm glad you brought that up.

00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.964
To take the mystery away,
I-- for every item that's

00:40:18.964 --> 00:40:20.630
featured in the book,
there's a sidebar,

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:25.280
and it has how to select
it, how to store it,

00:40:25.280 --> 00:40:27.320
when it's available,
and substitutions.

00:40:27.320 --> 00:40:30.840
Because not only-- like, if
you were living in an area

00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:33.360
where you just could
not find salad savoy,

00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.990
I want to make sure that you
can make the dish nonetheless.

00:40:36.990 --> 00:40:40.041
But also because you might fall
in love with a recipe, and then

00:40:40.041 --> 00:40:41.540
the item only has
a two-week season.

00:40:41.540 --> 00:40:44.340
So for instance, there's
a fiddlehead tempura

00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:47.890
in here with sriracha
creme fraiche that I love.

00:40:47.890 --> 00:40:49.892
But fiddleheads are
only around for a couple

00:40:49.892 --> 00:40:50.850
of weeks in the spring.

00:40:50.850 --> 00:40:52.260
So you can make that--

00:40:52.260 --> 00:40:54.700
I recommend using
asparagus or green beans.

00:40:54.700 --> 00:40:56.440
So I always list substitutions.

00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.170
But in regards to your
question about resources,

00:40:59.170 --> 00:41:01.060
one of the sites I
found really helpful

00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:03.110
is called "Specialty Produce."

00:41:03.110 --> 00:41:07.820
They have a really great website
that has everything on there.

00:41:07.820 --> 00:41:09.550
You can type it in,
and it will tell

00:41:09.550 --> 00:41:13.800
you its ethnographic
information, how to select,

00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.130
how to store.

00:41:15.130 --> 00:41:18.461
And then also what's cool is
they say recent sightings.

00:41:18.461 --> 00:41:20.460
So, like, "recent salad
savoy sightings," and it

00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:23.376
lists restaurants where
these things have recently

00:41:23.376 --> 00:41:24.500
been featured on the menus.

00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.725
So I really love that
because then I think, oh, I

00:41:26.725 --> 00:41:30.880
want to go see what they did
with Indian bitter melon,

00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:32.970
or I want to see
what they did with--

00:41:32.970 --> 00:41:35.860
what are some-- oh,
like lotus root.

00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:37.800
That's one of the more
beautiful vegetables

00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:41.490
that you can find that looks
like lace when you cut it open.

00:41:41.490 --> 00:41:45.640
So yeah, I think
specialty produce.

00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.160
And then the other site that
's really helpful is "Food 52."

00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.470
Has anyone--- yeah, [INAUDIBLE].

00:41:50.470 --> 00:41:52.810
So that's a really great
website that really goes

00:41:52.810 --> 00:41:55.400
into depth on each ingredient.

00:41:55.400 --> 00:42:00.945
And I think they
have recipes as well

00:42:00.945 --> 00:42:03.570
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: So when you
started to write this cookbook,

00:42:03.570 --> 00:42:05.280
is it what you
thought it would be as

00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:06.675
far as the investment of time?

00:42:06.675 --> 00:42:09.270
Were there any surprises
along the way on the journey?

00:42:09.270 --> 00:42:12.900
Anything you would
do differently?

00:42:12.900 --> 00:42:16.020
LAURA MCLIVELY: I should
say, so a lot of the recipes

00:42:16.020 --> 00:42:19.030
ended up coming from my blog,
and that was just for fun.

00:42:19.030 --> 00:42:20.950
You guys all work
at Google, so you'll

00:42:20.950 --> 00:42:22.950
think this is pathetic,
but, like, I didn't even

00:42:22.950 --> 00:42:25.770
know that you could tag blog
posts to make them searchable.

00:42:25.770 --> 00:42:27.170
I wasn't doing any of that.

00:42:27.170 --> 00:42:29.370
I just was doing it for fun.

00:42:29.370 --> 00:42:32.000
And so at that time, I
wasn't thinking of it

00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.670
as a time investment,
because it was just for me.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:38.610
But then once I signed
the cookbook contract,

00:42:38.610 --> 00:42:41.250
I was surprised, actually.

00:42:41.250 --> 00:42:43.865
It's like coming
up with 100 recipes

00:42:43.865 --> 00:42:47.250
maybe doesn't sound
crazy, but I was doing it

00:42:47.250 --> 00:42:50.140
while still working full
time as a clinical dietitian.

00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:55.150
And so that meant I spent pretty
much every evening after work

00:42:55.150 --> 00:42:58.289
just standing in the
aisles of Berkeley Bowl.

00:42:58.289 --> 00:43:00.580
Because you never know what
you're going to find there.

00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:04.020
And so it was really hard to
develop some of these recipes

00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:08.177
because I'd find sour plums,
for instance, and go, cool!

00:43:08.177 --> 00:43:09.760
I haven't seen these
in the store yet!

00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:12.160
And I'd take them home,
I'd come up with a recipe,

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:15.036
and then I'd go back
to get them to test it

00:43:15.036 --> 00:43:17.285
and they'd be gone already,
because these things have,

00:43:17.285 --> 00:43:18.576
like, a one or two-week season.

00:43:18.576 --> 00:43:22.770
So that made it challenging
and kind of delayed

00:43:22.770 --> 00:43:25.025
some of these recipes
coming to fruition,

00:43:25.025 --> 00:43:26.820
because I had to wait
for the next season

00:43:26.820 --> 00:43:29.405
when these things
were back available.

00:43:29.405 --> 00:43:31.590
And actually, a
little anecdote is

00:43:31.590 --> 00:43:33.600
that testing was
also a challenge

00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:37.540
because we wanted to make
sure every recipe in the book

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:39.440
was tested at least three times.

00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:42.700
And so something to has a
really short season, again,

00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:47.100
by the time I developed a recipe
and the editor approved it,

00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.290
the item was gone.

00:43:48.290 --> 00:43:51.900
And so I actually had some of my
friends living in New Zealand,

00:43:51.900 --> 00:43:53.557
they became recipe testers.

00:43:53.557 --> 00:43:55.640
So it was great because
they had opposite seasons.

00:43:55.640 --> 00:43:59.000
So they had, like, a
six-month lag where I'd say,

00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:03.050
OK, this one's ready, let
the New Zealand folks test it

00:44:03.050 --> 00:44:06.014
because they'll be able
to find it in six months.

00:44:06.014 --> 00:44:07.180
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Awesome.

00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:07.910
Yes, in the back?

00:44:07.910 --> 00:44:10.555
AUDIENCE: Is there a Berkeley
Bowl equivalent in New Zealand?

00:44:10.555 --> 00:44:12.680
LAURA MCLIVELY: Is there
a Berkeley Bowl equivalent

00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:13.410
in New Zealand?

00:44:13.410 --> 00:44:16.870
It's called, like, large
sprawls of land where people

00:44:16.870 --> 00:44:18.752
can grow their own veggies.

00:44:18.752 --> 00:44:21.910
So no, I don't think
there's an actual--

00:44:21.910 --> 00:44:25.730
I don't think there's a Berkeley
Bowl equivalent anywhere.

00:44:25.730 --> 00:44:28.940
There are some really great
produce markets all around,

00:44:28.940 --> 00:44:29.690
including LA.

00:44:29.690 --> 00:44:31.870
But Berkeley Bowl
really is unique.

00:44:31.870 --> 00:44:33.800
So for those who
haven't been, please

00:44:33.800 --> 00:44:36.490
make that a field trip there.

00:44:36.490 --> 00:44:39.435
It's really just hard to
find all of these things

00:44:39.435 --> 00:44:40.060
under one roof.

00:44:40.060 --> 00:44:42.610
And not only to find,
for instance, shiso,

00:44:42.610 --> 00:44:44.900
but to find five different
varieties of shiso.

00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.550
So you have options.

00:44:46.550 --> 00:44:49.286
They have 15 different
kinds of pineapple.

00:44:49.286 --> 00:44:52.604
It's like, who needs to choose
between 15 different kinds

00:44:52.604 --> 00:44:53.180
of pineapple?

00:44:53.180 --> 00:44:55.120
But if you're really
particular about the size

00:44:55.120 --> 00:44:58.190
and the level of acidity and
the country it comes from,

00:44:58.190 --> 00:45:03.210
if you want to shop with kind
of a social-justice conscience,

00:45:03.210 --> 00:45:05.690
then you can make your
selection and choose,

00:45:05.690 --> 00:45:08.760
I want a pineapple from this
country over that country.

00:45:08.760 --> 00:45:10.830
So no, I don't think
they have that.

00:45:10.830 --> 00:45:14.025
But my testers there, they
were really into farming,

00:45:14.025 --> 00:45:17.260
and so they grew a
lot of the stuff.

00:45:17.260 --> 00:45:20.166
They tested the cardoons
because cardoons also

00:45:20.166 --> 00:45:21.290
have a pretty short season.

00:45:21.290 --> 00:45:23.710
And so they even had those
growing in their garden,

00:45:23.710 --> 00:45:26.957
and they could test those.

00:45:26.957 --> 00:45:29.040
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: Laura,
what recipe in the book

00:45:29.040 --> 00:45:30.654
are you most proud of?

00:45:30.654 --> 00:45:32.320
I know that we talked
earlier, and there

00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.560
are some really
interesting ingredients

00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:36.860
that people might like to
hear more about and kind of

00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:39.984
how you got inspired to
come up with the recipes.

00:45:39.984 --> 00:45:41.650
LAURA MCLIVELY: Yeah,
I think the recipe

00:45:41.650 --> 00:45:44.410
I'm most proud of is--

00:45:44.410 --> 00:45:48.400
the example you used about your
wife-- the Indian bitter melon.

00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:53.210
So can raise your hand if you've
tried Indian bitter melon?

00:45:53.210 --> 00:45:54.730
OK, now keep your
hand up if you've

00:45:54.730 --> 00:45:57.100
liked Indian bitter melon.

00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.756
OK so we have, like,
eight people here.

00:45:59.756 --> 00:46:00.714
That's phenomenal.

00:46:00.714 --> 00:46:02.380
Usually, when I ask
that question, like,

00:46:02.380 --> 00:46:03.855
all the hands go down.

00:46:03.855 --> 00:46:05.940
So some people grew
up eating this.

00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:09.525
And it's really, really
good for you, I should say.

00:46:09.525 --> 00:46:11.170
It has really strong
anti-carcinogens

00:46:11.170 --> 00:46:13.180
and antioxidants in it.

00:46:13.180 --> 00:46:14.640
So I have patients
that will just

00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.372
blend this and kind
of plug their nose

00:46:16.372 --> 00:46:18.330
and drink it like a smoothie.

00:46:18.330 --> 00:46:20.560
But I wanted to find a
way to make it palatable.

00:46:20.560 --> 00:46:23.510
And the problem is
that I think when

00:46:23.510 --> 00:46:25.560
I heard that it was
bitter melon, I was like,

00:46:25.560 --> 00:46:26.827
OK, I like bitter.

00:46:26.827 --> 00:46:27.410
I like coffee.

00:46:27.410 --> 00:46:28.243
Yeah, I can do this.

00:46:28.243 --> 00:46:32.420
And I bit into it, and
it's not like coffee.

00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:36.410
To me, it really tastes
like ground-up aspirin,

00:46:36.410 --> 00:46:37.890
like really medicinal.

00:46:37.890 --> 00:46:42.340
And so it kind of made
my mouth go, like [GAG]..

00:46:42.340 --> 00:46:46.020
And so I tried to make
a curry and cover it up

00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.059
with a whole bunch of spices.

00:46:48.059 --> 00:46:49.850
That didn't work, so
then I was like, well,

00:46:49.850 --> 00:46:52.967
maybe I need coconut milk to
make it like a Thai cream.

00:46:52.967 --> 00:46:54.300
That will cover it up even more.

00:46:54.300 --> 00:46:55.258
And that made it worse.

00:46:55.258 --> 00:46:57.590
It's almost like the fat
drew out the bitterness.

00:46:57.590 --> 00:46:59.610
Then it was like Aspirin soup.

00:46:59.610 --> 00:47:01.870
And it was just a disaster.

00:47:01.870 --> 00:47:05.200
And so I persisted,
though, because I really

00:47:05.200 --> 00:47:07.084
wanted this ingredient
in the cookbook.

00:47:07.084 --> 00:47:08.500
Because it's, first
of all, really

00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.740
cool-looking, and also
very good for you.

00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:16.110
So then I just kind of changed
my course, my plan of attack.

00:47:16.110 --> 00:47:19.854
And I thought, I really should
try and go with the bitterness

00:47:19.854 --> 00:47:21.270
rather than trying
to cover it up.

00:47:21.270 --> 00:47:24.120
And so I thought
of things that I

00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.530
like that have that
same medicinal quality,

00:47:26.530 --> 00:47:28.770
and I thought of tonic.

00:47:28.770 --> 00:47:30.330
Because I love gin tonics.

00:47:30.330 --> 00:47:33.907
And tonic water has that
quinine, that kind of, like,

00:47:33.907 --> 00:47:35.990
bitterness to it, that if
you were to just have it

00:47:35.990 --> 00:47:38.860
on its own, it might not taste
that great, but in a tonic,

00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:40.140
it's wonderful.

00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:42.540
So I experimented with
recipes, and I ultimately

00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:45.750
came up with a homemade
tonic that you can

00:47:45.750 --> 00:47:47.456
make using Indian bitter melon.

00:47:47.456 --> 00:47:52.096
And you do it with grapefruit
and lemon and juniper berries.

00:47:52.096 --> 00:47:54.440
And it makes this
distilled tonic

00:47:54.440 --> 00:47:55.820
that you can keep
in your fridge.

00:47:55.820 --> 00:47:58.450
And you can just pour
it with some club soda

00:47:58.450 --> 00:48:00.930
and ice for a
non-alcoholic drink,

00:48:00.930 --> 00:48:03.500
or it's really good
as a gin tonic.

00:48:03.500 --> 00:48:06.430
And actually, one
of the sous chefs

00:48:06.430 --> 00:48:09.420
here came to one of my
talks at Omnivore Bookstore,

00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:10.830
and we served it there.

00:48:10.830 --> 00:48:13.735
So one person has had that,
at least, but I hope--

00:48:13.735 --> 00:48:16.110
whoever wants to take these
two home and try that recipe,

00:48:16.110 --> 00:48:19.071
you're welcome to.

00:48:19.071 --> 00:48:21.320
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: We have
time for one last question

00:48:21.320 --> 00:48:21.819
in the back.

00:48:21.819 --> 00:48:22.447
Yes?

00:48:22.447 --> 00:48:25.309
AUDIENCE: So while I'm excited
to try unique ingredients

00:48:25.309 --> 00:48:27.740
like this, what are
your tips on introducing

00:48:27.740 --> 00:48:32.315
your recipes to picky eaters,
like kids or husbands?

00:48:32.315 --> 00:48:34.464
LAURA MCLIVELY: Do
you have picky kids?

00:48:34.464 --> 00:48:35.110
AUDIENCE: No.

00:48:35.110 --> 00:48:36.485
LAURA MCLIVELY:
So she asked what

00:48:36.485 --> 00:48:40.300
are my tips on introducing
these things to picky eaters.

00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:41.940
Oh, did I just turn off my mic?

00:48:41.940 --> 00:48:44.080
We're good, OK.

00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:46.210
So I have a six-month
old, so I, unfortunately,

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.810
don't have quite a
lot of experience

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:51.000
in feeding my kid
with these things,

00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.290
or feeding my kid these
things, because she just

00:48:53.290 --> 00:48:53.980
started to eat.

00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:57.780
So we're on the sweet
potato level right now.

00:48:57.780 --> 00:49:01.690
But I think food is
all about the attitude

00:49:01.690 --> 00:49:02.740
that you serve it with.

00:49:02.740 --> 00:49:06.670
And again, even adults
can have a hard time

00:49:06.670 --> 00:49:08.830
looking at something
new and seeing it

00:49:08.830 --> 00:49:11.740
in the context of
their own kitchen.

00:49:11.740 --> 00:49:15.440
So I think it's just about
going with the attitude of fun

00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.300
and discovery.

00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:18.895
And I actually, at one
of my books signings,

00:49:18.895 --> 00:49:23.020
a French mom came up to me with
her, like, 10-year-old son,

00:49:23.020 --> 00:49:26.110
and she's like, my son never
wanted to eat vegetables,

00:49:26.110 --> 00:49:28.970
but we got your book, and he's
treating like his project.

00:49:28.970 --> 00:49:30.580
So he had all the
pages earmarked,

00:49:30.580 --> 00:49:33.290
and he'd written notes
in the columns of, like,

00:49:33.290 --> 00:49:37.167
"buy agave" and things that he
wanted to remind himself to do.

00:49:37.167 --> 00:49:39.500
And she said they cooked their
way through eight recipes

00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:42.580
already, and that he was really
excited because it was kind

00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.170
of like cool things, right?

00:49:44.170 --> 00:49:46.574
It's not like the typical
spinach and broccoli

00:49:46.574 --> 00:49:47.740
that his mom was giving him.

00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:51.040
So I think, like,
what kid wouldn't

00:49:51.040 --> 00:49:53.950
be excited about peeling this?

00:49:53.950 --> 00:49:56.090
If you involve your kids
in these sort of things,

00:49:56.090 --> 00:49:58.950
it can make it more fun.

00:49:58.950 --> 00:50:02.210
But yeah, I think just going
with that sense of discovery

00:50:02.210 --> 00:50:04.170
can make a big difference
for a picky eater.

00:50:07.970 --> 00:50:09.470
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI:
How is the food?

00:50:09.470 --> 00:50:10.355
AUDIENCE: It's so good.

00:50:10.355 --> 00:50:12.188
SCOTT GIAMBASTIANI: I
can't wait to dive in,

00:50:12.188 --> 00:50:14.480
so I'm going to
selfishly ask everyone

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:16.840
to give a huge round of
applause so I can eat some food.

00:50:16.840 --> 00:50:18.256
LAURA MCLIVELY:
Thanks for coming.

00:50:18.256 --> 00:50:19.923
