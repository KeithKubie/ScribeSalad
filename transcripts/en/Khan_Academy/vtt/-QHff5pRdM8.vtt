00:00:00.505 --> 00:00:02.861
- [Voiceover] So we have a
bunch of numbers listed up here,

00:00:02.861 --> 00:00:05.729
and my goal, in this video,
is to see if we can classify

00:00:05.729 --> 00:00:08.562
them into different types
of number categories,

00:00:08.562 --> 00:00:10.468
and let me draw the categories.

00:00:10.468 --> 00:00:13.694
So this circle, over here,

00:00:13.694 --> 00:00:16.828
this represents all of the numbers

00:00:16.828 --> 00:00:18.895
that can be represented as the fraction

00:00:18.895 --> 00:00:21.066
of two integers, and, of
course, the denominator

00:00:21.066 --> 00:00:23.295
can't be equal to zero,
because we don't know

00:00:23.295 --> 00:00:25.977
what it means to put a
zero in the denominator.

00:00:25.977 --> 00:00:28.659
So, let's call these, or the standard way

00:00:28.659 --> 00:00:29.611
of calling these things.

00:00:29.611 --> 00:00:31.759
These things can be
represented as a fraction

00:00:31.759 --> 00:00:36.588
of two integers, we call
these rational numbers.

00:00:36.588 --> 00:00:37.938
Rational numbers.

00:00:37.938 --> 00:00:42.193
And if something cannot be
represented as a fraction

00:00:42.193 --> 00:00:45.485
of two integers, we
call irrational numbers.

00:00:45.485 --> 00:00:48.283
Irrational numbers.

00:00:48.283 --> 00:00:49.930
Irrational numbers.

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.230
And the size of these circles don't show

00:00:52.230 --> 00:00:53.855
how large these sets are.

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:56.328
There's actually an
infinite number of rational

00:00:56.328 --> 00:00:58.639
and an infinite number
of irrational numbers.

00:00:58.639 --> 00:01:01.100
So, these are the irrational numbers.

00:01:01.100 --> 00:01:02.923
Irrational.

00:01:02.923 --> 00:01:06.219
So, these cannot be
represented as a fraction

00:01:06.219 --> 00:01:07.753
of two integers.

00:01:07.753 --> 00:01:09.157
And then, within rational numbers,

00:01:09.157 --> 00:01:11.677
you have integers themselves.

00:01:11.677 --> 00:01:15.496
So, I'll do that in, let me
do that in this blue color.

00:01:15.496 --> 00:01:16.954
Integers.

00:01:16.954 --> 00:01:19.288
So, integers are numbers that don't have

00:01:19.288 --> 00:01:23.607
to be represented as a
fraction or a decimal.

00:01:23.607 --> 00:01:28.328
So, these are integers, right over here.

00:01:28.328 --> 00:01:29.876
Integers.

00:01:29.876 --> 00:01:32.802
And then a subset of
integers are whole numbers.

00:01:32.802 --> 00:01:35.281
So, if you essentially say
the non-negative integers,

00:01:35.281 --> 00:01:37.678
you're then talking about whole numbers.

00:01:37.678 --> 00:01:41.753
So let me do that subset, right over here.

00:01:41.753 --> 00:01:45.166
So, these are going to
be the whole numbers.

00:01:45.166 --> 00:01:49.253
So, whole numbers.

00:01:49.253 --> 00:01:52.101
Whole numbers, right over here.

00:01:52.101 --> 00:01:53.669
And, actually, let me just label it all.

00:01:53.669 --> 00:01:54.954
These are rational...

00:01:54.954 --> 00:01:56.637
Let me do that in the same color.

00:01:56.637 --> 00:02:00.344
Rational numbers.

00:02:00.344 --> 00:02:03.104
And, of course, irrational numbers.

00:02:03.104 --> 00:02:05.965
Irrational numbers.

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:08.746
Irrational numbers.

00:02:08.746 --> 00:02:09.466
An integer.

00:02:09.466 --> 00:02:11.393
Well, if I could say,
"Look, that is an integer.

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:12.589
"Let's think about the integers."

00:02:12.589 --> 00:02:14.184
But I wouldn't say, "Let's
just think about the rational."

00:02:14.184 --> 00:02:16.026
I'd say, "Let's think about
the rational numbers."

00:02:16.026 --> 00:02:17.523
All right, now that we have
these categories in place,

00:02:17.523 --> 00:02:18.394
let's categorize them.

00:02:18.394 --> 00:02:19.836
Like always, pause the video.

00:02:19.836 --> 00:02:21.893
See if you can figure out what category

00:02:21.893 --> 00:02:23.793
these numbers fall into.

00:02:23.793 --> 00:02:27.427
Where would you put them on this diagram?

00:02:27.427 --> 00:02:29.191
So, let's start off with three.

00:02:29.191 --> 00:02:30.852
This is positive three.

00:02:30.852 --> 00:02:33.661
It can be definitely
represented as a fraction.

00:02:33.661 --> 00:02:36.065
You can represent it as three over one.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:38.468
But, it doesn't have to be
represented as a fraction.

00:02:38.468 --> 00:02:41.440
It, literally, could be just
a three, right over there,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.891
but it's also non-negative.

00:02:42.891 --> 00:02:45.910
So three is a whole number.

00:02:45.910 --> 00:02:49.857
So three, and maybe I'll do it
in the color of the category.

00:02:49.857 --> 00:02:54.559
So, three is a whole number.

00:02:54.559 --> 00:02:56.045
So, it's a member of that set.

00:02:56.045 --> 00:02:57.659
But if you're a whole number,
you're also an integer,

00:02:57.659 --> 00:02:59.401
and you're also a rational number.

00:02:59.401 --> 00:03:01.142
So, three is a whole
number, it's an integer,

00:03:01.142 --> 00:03:03.452
and it's a rational number.

00:03:03.452 --> 00:03:06.087
Now, let's think about negative five.

00:03:06.087 --> 00:03:08.073
Now, negative five, once
again, it can be represented

00:03:08.073 --> 00:03:09.928
as a fraction, but it doesn't have to be,

00:03:09.928 --> 00:03:11.045
but it is negative.

00:03:11.045 --> 00:03:12.621
So, it's not gonna be a whole number.

00:03:12.621 --> 00:03:14.900
So, negative five is going
to sit right over here.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:16.967
It's an integer, and if you're an integer,

00:03:16.967 --> 00:03:19.486
you're definitely going
to be a rational number,

00:03:19.486 --> 00:03:22.656
but it's not a whole number
because it is negative.

00:03:24.476 --> 00:03:28.765
Now we have 0.25.

00:03:28.765 --> 00:03:32.790
Well, this, for sure, can be
represented as a fraction.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.568
This is 25-hundredths, right over here.

00:03:35.568 --> 00:03:37.461
So, we can represent that as a fraction

00:03:37.461 --> 00:03:39.748
of two integers, I should say.

00:03:39.748 --> 00:03:41.431
It's 25-hundredths.

00:03:41.431 --> 00:03:42.592
But there's no way to represent this

00:03:42.592 --> 00:03:46.131
except using a fraction of two integers.

00:03:46.131 --> 00:03:50.104
So, 0.25 is a rational number,

00:03:50.104 --> 00:03:53.506
but it's not an integer
and not a whole number.

00:03:53.506 --> 00:03:56.559
Now what about 22 over seven.

00:03:56.559 --> 00:03:58.289
Well, here it's clearly
represented, already,

00:03:58.289 --> 00:04:01.108
as a fraction of two integers,

00:04:01.108 --> 00:04:04.316
but I don't think I can
represent this any other,

00:04:04.316 --> 00:04:06.010
except as a fraction of two integers.

00:04:06.010 --> 00:04:08.840
I can't somehow make this

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:11.675
without using a fraction
or some type of decimal

00:04:11.675 --> 00:04:14.565
that might repeat.

00:04:14.565 --> 00:04:16.679
So, this, right over here, this would

00:04:16.679 --> 00:04:19.570
also be a rational number,

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:23.297
but it's not an integer,
not a whole number.

00:04:23.297 --> 00:04:25.688
Now this over here.

00:04:28.098 --> 00:04:29.898
0.2713.

00:04:29.898 --> 00:04:30.820
Now the 13 repeats.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:35.349
This is the same thing as 0.27131313,

00:04:35.349 --> 00:04:38.007
that's what line up there represents.

00:04:38.007 --> 00:04:40.038
Now, you might not realize it yet,

00:04:40.038 --> 00:04:42.802
but any number that repeats eventually,

00:04:42.802 --> 00:04:43.997
this one does repeat eventually,

00:04:43.997 --> 00:04:45.895
you have the .1313,

00:04:45.895 --> 00:04:49.018
or you have the 0.27131313,

00:04:49.018 --> 00:04:53.364
any number like this can be
represented as a fraction.

00:04:53.364 --> 00:04:54.858
For example, and I'm
not going to do it here,

00:04:54.858 --> 00:04:55.972
just for the sake of time,

00:04:55.972 --> 00:04:58.689
but, for example, 0.3, repeating,

00:04:58.689 --> 00:04:59.978
that's the same thing as one-third.

00:04:59.978 --> 00:05:01.382
And later on, we're gonna see techniques

00:05:01.382 --> 00:05:04.902
of how do you convert this to
a fraction of two integers.

00:05:04.902 --> 00:05:06.698
But, for our sake, we just know

00:05:06.698 --> 00:05:09.115
that this can be represented
as a fraction of two integers

00:05:09.115 --> 00:05:11.808
just the way that 0.3, repeating, can be.

00:05:11.808 --> 00:05:14.629
And so, we would put this
under rational numbers.

00:05:14.629 --> 00:05:18.763
0.2713, repeating.

00:05:18.763 --> 00:05:22.291
But you have to represent
it either as a decimal

00:05:22.291 --> 00:05:24.323
or a fraction of integers.

00:05:24.323 --> 00:05:26.706
If you didn't have to, then
it could have been an integer,

00:05:26.706 --> 00:05:30.187
but we'll throw it up
there in rational numbers.

00:05:30.187 --> 00:05:32.288
Now the square root of ten.

00:05:32.288 --> 00:05:33.358
Square root of ten.

00:05:33.358 --> 00:05:34.743
This is interesting.

00:05:34.743 --> 00:05:38.215
So, any square root of
a non-perfect square

00:05:38.215 --> 00:05:40.432
is going to be irrational.

00:05:40.432 --> 00:05:42.044
So, this is gonna be irrational.

00:05:42.044 --> 00:05:43.985
I'm not proving it to you here,

00:05:43.985 --> 00:05:47.154
but you cannot represent this as the ratio

00:05:47.154 --> 00:05:50.835
of two integers, or a
fraction with two integers,

00:05:50.835 --> 00:05:51.984
with an integer in the numerator

00:05:51.984 --> 00:05:53.377
and an integer in the denominator.

00:05:53.377 --> 00:05:55.618
This will be, if you were to represent it

00:05:55.618 --> 00:05:58.648
as a decimal, it will not repeat.

00:05:58.648 --> 00:06:01.644
It'll just keep being new and new digits.

00:06:01.644 --> 00:06:03.873
It will not repeat over time.

00:06:03.873 --> 00:06:06.311
So, this, right over here,
is an irrational number.

00:06:06.311 --> 00:06:07.366
It's not rational.

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:11.748
It cannot be represented as
the ratio of two integers.

00:06:11.748 --> 00:06:13.834
All right, 14 over seven.

00:06:13.834 --> 00:06:15.123
This is the ratio of two integers.

00:06:15.123 --> 00:06:17.584
So, this, for sure, is rational.

00:06:17.584 --> 00:06:19.277
But if you think about it, 14 over seven,

00:06:19.277 --> 00:06:20.963
that's another way of saying,

00:06:20.963 --> 00:06:24.480
14 over seven is the same thing as two.

00:06:24.480 --> 00:06:26.547
These two things are equivalent.

00:06:26.547 --> 00:06:29.519
So, 14 over seven is
the same thing as two.

00:06:29.519 --> 00:06:31.238
So, this is actually a whole number.

00:06:31.238 --> 00:06:32.328
It doesn't look like a whole number,

00:06:32.328 --> 00:06:33.466
but, remember, a whole number

00:06:33.466 --> 00:06:36.369
is a non-negative number that doesn't need

00:06:36.369 --> 00:06:39.109
to be represented as the
ratio of two integers.

00:06:39.109 --> 00:06:40.676
And this one, even though
we did represent it

00:06:40.676 --> 00:06:42.313
as the ratio of two
integers, it doesn't need

00:06:42.313 --> 00:06:44.090
to be represented as the
ratio of two integers.

00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:46.190
You could have represent this as just two.

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:48.440
So, that's going to be a whole number.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:51.288
14 over seven, which is
the same thing as two,

00:06:51.288 --> 00:06:54.016
that is a whole number.

00:06:54.016 --> 00:06:55.735
Now, two-pi.

00:06:55.735 --> 00:06:58.927
Now pi is an irrational...

00:06:58.927 --> 00:07:01.400
Pi is an irrational number.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.697
So if we just take a multiple of pi,

00:07:04.697 --> 00:07:07.786
if we just take a integer multiple of pi,

00:07:07.786 --> 00:07:10.433
like that, this is also going
to be an irrational number.

00:07:10.433 --> 00:07:12.710
If you looked at its
decimal representation,

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:14.891
it will never repeat.

00:07:14.891 --> 00:07:17.201
So that's two-pi, right over there.

00:07:17.201 --> 00:07:18.188
Now what about...

00:07:18.188 --> 00:07:20.174
Let me do that same, since
I've been consistent,

00:07:20.174 --> 00:07:22.705
relatively consistent, with the colors.

00:07:22.705 --> 00:07:25.665
So, this is two-pi right over there.

00:07:25.665 --> 00:07:28.927
Now, what about the
negative square root of 25.

00:07:28.927 --> 00:07:30.832
Well, 25's a perfect square.

00:07:30.832 --> 00:07:32.817
Square root of that's just gonna be five.

00:07:32.817 --> 00:07:34.674
So, this thing is going to be,

00:07:34.674 --> 00:07:38.181
this thing is going to be
equivalent to negative five.

00:07:38.181 --> 00:07:39.922
So, this is just another representation

00:07:39.922 --> 00:07:41.664
of this, right over here.

00:07:41.664 --> 00:07:43.196
So, it is an integer.

00:07:43.196 --> 00:07:44.775
It's not a whole number
because it's negative,

00:07:44.775 --> 00:07:46.087
but it's an integer.

00:07:46.087 --> 00:07:47.701
Negative square root of 25.

00:07:47.701 --> 00:07:49.255
These two things are actually...

00:07:49.255 --> 00:07:51.811
These two things are
actually the same number,

00:07:51.811 --> 00:07:54.121
just different ways of representing them.

00:07:54.121 --> 00:07:56.269
And then you have, let's
see, you have the square root

00:07:56.269 --> 00:07:59.450
of nine over...

00:07:59.450 --> 00:08:01.679
The square root of nine over seven.

00:08:01.679 --> 00:08:04.117
Well, what's the principal root of nine?

00:08:04.117 --> 00:08:06.358
This thing is gonna be the same thing,

00:08:06.358 --> 00:08:07.670
this thing is the same...

00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.486
Let me do this in a different color.

00:08:09.486 --> 00:08:12.859
This is the same thing as,

00:08:12.859 --> 00:08:14.485
square root of nine is three,

00:08:14.485 --> 00:08:17.318
it's the principal root of
nine, so it's three-sevenths.

00:08:17.318 --> 00:08:19.593
So, this is a ratio of two integers.

00:08:19.593 --> 00:08:21.161
This is a rational number.

00:08:21.161 --> 00:08:22.984
Square root of nine over seven

00:08:22.984 --> 00:08:24.783
is the same thing as three-sevenths.

00:08:24.783 --> 00:08:27.802
Now, let me just give you
one more just for the road.

00:08:27.802 --> 00:08:31.703
What about pi over pi?

00:08:31.703 --> 00:08:33.827
What is that going to be?

00:08:33.827 --> 00:08:37.751
Well, pi divided by pi is
going to be equal to one.

00:08:37.751 --> 00:08:39.528
So, this is actually a whole number.

00:08:39.528 --> 00:08:43.037
So I could write pi over
pi, right over there.

00:08:43.037 --> 00:08:47.052
That's just a very
fancy way of saying one.
