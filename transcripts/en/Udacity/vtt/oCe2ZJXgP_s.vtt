00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:02.370
So just for completeness, I want to mention some other

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:05.340
techniques besides the traditional ones that we just saw that

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.880
can be used for requirements solicitation. And these other

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.740
techniques can be divided in three main groups. There are

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.820
collaborative techniques that were created to support incremental development

00:00:14.820 --> 00:00:18.850
of complex systems with large diverse user populations. An example

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.130
of such techniques which is widely used and you

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:25.120
might know is brainstorming. There are also social approaches and

00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:28.140
these are approaches, techniques that exploit the social

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:31.520
sciences to better collect information from the stakeholders and

00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:34.310
the environment. And among those I just want to mention

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:36.730
ethnographic techniques which are based on the idea of

00:00:36.730 --> 00:00:40.100
collecting information on the participants by observing them

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:44.660
in their original environment. Finally cognitive techniques, leverage cognitive

00:00:44.660 --> 00:00:48.490
science approaches to discover expert knowledge for example they

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.260
can be used to understand the problem solving methods.

00:00:51.260 --> 00:00:54.000
And in case you're interested in finding out more about this and

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.580
other techniques, I'm providing some references in the notes for the lesson.
