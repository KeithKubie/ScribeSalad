[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.170 --> 00:00:08.370
MELISSA POULOS: We have
Rakesh Satyal with us today,

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:09.810
really excited.

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:15.871
Award winning author and editor,
teaches at NYU, sings cabaret,

00:00:15.871 --> 00:00:17.370
and you need to
check that show out.

00:00:17.370 --> 00:00:18.030
It's great.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:19.980
And very, very close
friend of mine.

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:21.530
So we are super thrilled
to have you here, Rakesh.

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:22.976
Thank you so much
for joining us.

00:00:22.976 --> 00:00:24.600
RAKESH SATYAL: Thank
you for having me.

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.016
MELISSA POULOS: He has gotten
some incredible press lately

00:00:27.016 --> 00:00:29.160
with the launch of
his second book,

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:31.329
"No One Can Pronounce My Name."

00:00:31.329 --> 00:00:32.870
Am I pronouncing
your name correctly?

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:35.109
RAKESH SATYAL: You are,
yeah, after all these years,

00:00:35.109 --> 00:00:36.650
you're now asking
me, after 15 years.

00:00:36.650 --> 00:00:38.108
MELISSA POULOS:
It's been 20 years.

00:00:40.490 --> 00:00:42.480
But welcome, and
welcome to Google.

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:45.960
And I thought maybe you could
do a quick intro for everyone,

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:47.460
tell us a little
bit about yourself,

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.650
that I haven't
already told them all.

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:52.650
RAKESH SATYAL: So, as Melissa
said, this is my second novel,

00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:54.330
it just went on sale in May.

00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:57.980
My first novel, "Blue
Boy" went on sale in 2009.

00:00:57.980 --> 00:00:59.250
It shows you how lazy I am.

00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:00.990
So I'll see you in eight years.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:05.099
And I grew up in Ohio.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:07.650
So both books actually
take place in Ohio.

00:01:07.650 --> 00:01:09.460
The first one takes
place in Cincinnati,

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:10.640
which is my hometown.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:13.860
And this latest one takes
place primarily in Cleveland.

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:15.420
And I've worked
in book publishing

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.540
for more than a dozen years.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:20.522
I actually began my
publishing career as an intern

00:01:20.522 --> 00:01:22.980
at what was then known at the
Doubleday Broadway Publishing

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.350
Group, which was
Park Random House.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:27.090
And I worked for
a legendary editor

00:01:27.090 --> 00:01:30.530
there, who's still there,
who was a wonderful mentor.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:32.040
So I worked for him for--

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.415
after I graduated-- we actually
graduated from college,

00:01:34.415 --> 00:01:36.540
and the following Monday,
I started working for him

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.530
as his assistant.

00:01:37.530 --> 00:01:40.880
So that was very fortuitous
to intern for him.

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:43.320
And then I worked there for
about four and a half years,

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.986
and then I moved over
to Harper Collins,

00:01:44.986 --> 00:01:47.935
where I worked for
another for five years.

00:01:47.935 --> 00:01:49.560
And some of the bigger
authors I worked

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.270
with when I was at
Harper that I edited

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.240
were Paul Rudnick,
Paul Coelho, who

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:57.522
wrote "The Alchemist," Clive
Barker, Armistead Maupin who

00:01:57.522 --> 00:01:59.360
wrote the "Tales of
the City" series, who

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:01.900
has a new memoir
coming out this fall.

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.500
And then I actually
had a detour,

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:06.240
closer to your world
of things, where

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:10.710
I worked at Lexicon Branding and
in Sausalito, California, doing

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:11.520
naming work.

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:14.220
So I worked there
for a while, and was

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:17.490
in the world of branding for
about three years, all told,

00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:18.780
doing naming work.

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:20.140
Back here in New York, as well.

00:02:20.140 --> 00:02:24.360
And then I went back into
publishing, which is a rarity.

00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:26.910
People sometimes leave
and they don't go back.

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:28.980
But I really missed
working with authors.

00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:30.240
I really love working on--

00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:33.060
I love editing their work, I
love conceptualizing their work

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:33.960
with them.

00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:35.400
So I work at Atria
Books, which is

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.840
a division of
Simon and Schuster,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.910
where I primarily work
on narrative nonfiction.

00:02:39.910 --> 00:02:42.600
And then I do some
literary fiction as well.

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.380
Some books that I'm
working on currently,

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:49.050
actually this past Tuesday, my
author Janet Mock's new memoir

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.300
went on sale, "Surpassing
Certainty," which is wonderful.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:55.590
I have a memoir coming out this
fall by the TV writer Michael

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:57.429
Ausiello, who wrote a
really popular column

00:02:57.429 --> 00:02:59.220
for "Entertainment
Weekly" for a long time,

00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:00.136
called "Ask Ausiello."

00:03:00.136 --> 00:03:01.350
I'm glad you know who he is.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.750
And we actually just got an
amazing plug for that book

00:03:03.750 --> 00:03:05.210
from JJ Abrams.

00:03:05.210 --> 00:03:06.870
So that's very exciting.

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:10.117
And I'm doing Jake
Shears' memoir, who

00:03:10.117 --> 00:03:12.450
was the lead singer of Scissor
Sisters, that band, which

00:03:12.450 --> 00:03:14.250
goes on sale next spring.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:15.905
That's going to be a ton of fun.

00:03:15.905 --> 00:03:18.450
Then I have an Italian novel
that I'm really excited about,

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.390
next March, called "The Eight
Mountains" by a writer named

00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:26.110
Paolo Cognetti, which is a short
novel, about 200 pages, about

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.770
the lifelong friendship
between two Italian boys who

00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:31.710
meet in the Alps, one who's
from a family of privilege,

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:35.479
and one who comes from salt
of the earth, mountain family.

00:03:35.479 --> 00:03:37.020
And it's sort of
like people comment,

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:38.690
it's sort of a male
Elena Ferrante.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:40.080
It's that kind of storytelling.

00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:41.740
It's really beautiful.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:43.620
So that's kind of my
professional life.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.270
And then, it's been really
exciting having this out.

00:03:46.270 --> 00:03:49.740
And so, I wear both hats,
including this awful baseball

00:03:49.740 --> 00:03:50.650
cap.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.810
And so I do it all.

00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:57.720
So that's some 500
things about me.

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:59.220
MELISSA POULOS:
Well, I want to talk

00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.345
about the book in a second.

00:04:00.345 --> 00:04:04.080
But I first wanted to ask
you a bit about your process.

00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:06.960
So it's your second novel.

00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:07.800
How do you work?

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.110
How is it different
maybe from the first one?

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.742
Tell us a little bit about
how you came to finish this.

00:04:13.742 --> 00:04:16.200
RAKESH SATYAL: You know, I tell
all my authors all the time

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.709
when I'm working with them,
have a real, be very regimented,

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.200
have a schedule,
write every day.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.660
I'm a complete hypocrite,
because I don't do any of that.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:26.850
I feel like since I'm a
task master in that job,

00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.760
I can just sort of
fudge it on my end.

00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:33.990
It was very instructive
working on a second book.

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.640
I know you hear about
sophomore slumps,

00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:37.500
and you hear about
going back to the well,

00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:39.722
and how difficult it can be.

00:04:39.722 --> 00:04:41.430
With the first book,
I think most people,

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.220
you feel an urgency to
kind of tell your story,

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.902
to get your voice
out into the world.

00:04:45.902 --> 00:04:47.610
There's a certain
propulsion behind that,

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:50.760
to get your thoughts
you've had kicking around

00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:53.340
in your head for quite some
time out and onto the page,

00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.050
and then into people's hands.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.920
And as with many
writers, my first book

00:04:57.920 --> 00:04:59.920
was semi-autobiographical,
and I mean more of it

00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:02.400
is conjured than
people might think.

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:04.650
But that had a certain
movement to it,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:06.190
because I felt urgency about it.

00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:09.140
I felt like I knew who
the characters were,

00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:10.160
I knew the character.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.960
It'd be written in first person.

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:14.420
It would be-- the
12-year-old Indian boy--

00:05:14.420 --> 00:05:16.691
the first book, "Blue Boy"
is about-- it takes place

00:05:16.691 --> 00:05:18.440
in a very fixed period
of time in the life

00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:20.510
of a 12-year-old
Indian-American boy growing up

00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:23.450
in the Midwest, who thinks he's
the reincarnation of Krishnaji,

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:24.230
the Hindu god.

00:05:24.230 --> 00:05:27.201
So there's almost a
construct established

00:05:27.201 --> 00:05:28.700
at the beginning
of that book, where

00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.440
he goes through
certain exercises

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.080
to almost make his life
match the life of Krishnaji.

00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.270
So there was almost
a roadmap I created

00:05:35.270 --> 00:05:37.100
for myself to finish that book.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:40.032
And it was just a question
of pushing myself to do it.

00:05:40.032 --> 00:05:41.240
This book was very different.

00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:43.340
Because I began
writing it not sure

00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.170
if it was going to be
a short story or what

00:05:45.170 --> 00:05:47.330
it was really going
to end up being.

00:05:47.330 --> 00:05:48.290
And what happened is--

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:51.080
the central
relationship in the book

00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.130
is-- there are two main
characters in the book.

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:56.926
One is a middle-aged
Indian man in his--

00:05:56.926 --> 00:05:59.930
he's in his mid-40s, who lives
in Cleveland with his mother.

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.289
And you find at the
beginning of the book that--

00:06:02.289 --> 00:06:03.830
I might read from
that later, so I'll

00:06:03.830 --> 00:06:04.940
tell you what you
find out later--

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:06.560
but that's one of
the main characters.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:08.630
And the other
character is a woman

00:06:08.630 --> 00:06:10.640
in her mid-40's,
who has just seen

00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:13.520
her first, her only child,
her son, off to college,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:15.050
and is sort of
unhappily married.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:18.620
And to keep herself enthused,
she writes paranormal romances

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:19.240
as a secret.

00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:22.100
So it's about how the two
of them become friends.

00:06:22.100 --> 00:06:24.590
But that made that first
character I mentioned,

00:06:24.590 --> 00:06:27.050
he came from the idea
that years ago, I

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:30.500
had a family friend whose
uncle came to town to visit.

00:06:30.500 --> 00:06:32.250
And if you know
Indian people, uncle

00:06:32.250 --> 00:06:34.000
is a catch-all term
that can mean anything

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.759
from an actual uncle to some
tenuous familial connection

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:37.800
that you don't even like.

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:44.000
So i met a family friend of
his, who was in his mid-40s.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:44.840
He was unmarried.

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.250
He lived with his
mother in New Jersey.

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.850
And I remember everybody having
this implicit understanding

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.280
about him, that because
all those things were true,

00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:53.330
he had to be gay.

00:06:53.330 --> 00:06:55.100
Because that was
the only reason that

00:06:55.100 --> 00:06:59.400
could explain having that
kind of life, so to speak.

00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:01.400
And I remember being
doubly disheartened

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.260
by that, because
one, I was obviously

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.750
a closeted teenager
in the Midwest

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:10.790
and found that kind of gossip
not particularly encouraging.

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:13.880
But also, in addition to that,
and an extension of that,

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:16.070
people were framing
his life for him.

00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:17.954
There was no-- he had
no agency in the way

00:07:17.954 --> 00:07:19.370
that people were
talking about him

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:21.200
and what his story might be.

00:07:21.200 --> 00:07:23.570
So I started writing
that character.

00:07:23.570 --> 00:07:26.385
I felt like because my first
book was a younger character,

00:07:26.385 --> 00:07:28.510
there were certain queer
themes that were explored.

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:30.301
And I felt a responsibility
to kind of talk

00:07:30.301 --> 00:07:32.720
to people at a different
point in their lives.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:34.465
And be completely
frank, when I was

00:07:34.465 --> 00:07:35.840
writing that
character initially,

00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.900
I was incredibly lonely.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.600
My life as a single,
not happily single,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.170
and I was dealing with all
of these issues of like kind

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:45.710
of what it means to be
lonely, and if that's

00:07:45.710 --> 00:07:49.280
your default state, if that
can be made productive at all.

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:52.280
And the more I began to write
that character-- actually,

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.740
when I initially
started writing him,

00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.810
I didn't really think
about necessarily

00:07:56.810 --> 00:07:58.860
what his sexuality
was going to be.

00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.680
And then when I thought
about the themes

00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:02.000
I was really trying
to capture and what

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:03.170
I was trying to do
with that character,

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.450
I realized actually it's
much more compelling

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.060
if he is in fact
queer in some way,

00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:11.580
and he doesn't even know what
he thinks about the world.

00:08:11.580 --> 00:08:15.800
So because of that-- and again,
laziness comes into play here.

00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:17.560
Because there were
different threads,

00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:18.590
there are those two
main characters,

00:08:18.590 --> 00:08:20.423
and there are a lot of
auxiliary characters.

00:08:20.423 --> 00:08:22.854
And the book is told in a
close third person among them.

00:08:22.854 --> 00:08:24.770
I would get really lazy
writing one character,

00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:25.650
not sure what was happening.

00:08:25.650 --> 00:08:26.750
And then I would just
jump to the other one,

00:08:26.750 --> 00:08:27.620
and start writing that.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:28.700
And then I would
jump to the other one

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:29.660
and start writing that.

00:08:29.660 --> 00:08:31.160
And then when you
go back, it really

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:32.909
makes your job much
harder, because if you

00:08:32.909 --> 00:08:35.450
want to create a cohesive
narrative, as a writer,

00:08:35.450 --> 00:08:37.190
it's not great to
do that to yourself.

00:08:37.190 --> 00:08:39.815
Because you are like, oh, where
was I, and what does this mean.

00:08:39.815 --> 00:08:41.576
And what was I
thinking a year ago,

00:08:41.576 --> 00:08:43.159
when I was writing
that other section.

00:08:43.159 --> 00:08:46.850
So all this to say, I made
it much harder for myself.

00:08:46.850 --> 00:08:48.570
It was much harder.

00:08:48.570 --> 00:08:50.690
But I certainly
learned things going

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:53.340
into the next project I work
on, of like how not to do that,

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.600
how to keep a better idea,
a work ethic in mind that

00:08:56.600 --> 00:08:58.997
will keep me on track.

00:08:58.997 --> 00:09:00.830
MELISSA POULOS: Well,
I think we should just

00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.660
keep talking about
the book, because now

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:06.490
that we've introduced
one of the characters,

00:09:06.490 --> 00:09:09.182
maybe tell us a little
bit more about some

00:09:09.182 --> 00:09:10.640
of the other
characters plot lines,

00:09:10.640 --> 00:09:14.090
and maybe we can
do a quick reading.

00:09:14.090 --> 00:09:15.980
RAKESH SATYAL: So,
that's the main.

00:09:15.980 --> 00:09:18.560
I'll read his section, so
you'll find out about him.

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:20.430
The second character,
Ranjana, like I said,

00:09:20.430 --> 00:09:23.720
she lives in Cleveland
with her husband,

00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:26.930
Mohan, and they've just seen
their only child, Prashant,

00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:28.130
off to college.

00:09:28.130 --> 00:09:32.090
He goes to Princeton,
shocker for us.

00:09:32.090 --> 00:09:35.574
And she-- because she feels
very isolated-- and one

00:09:35.574 --> 00:09:37.490
of the things I was
exploring in her character

00:09:37.490 --> 00:09:39.500
in particular-- both
of them, both Harit,

00:09:39.500 --> 00:09:41.390
who's the other
character, and Ranjana,

00:09:41.390 --> 00:09:47.480
are people who haven't spent any
copious amount of time thinking

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.670
about, again, what agency
they have in the world,

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.950
like what are they allowed
to feel, what are they

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:52.970
allowed to talk about.

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:55.790
And in her case, she realizes
over the course of the book--

00:09:55.790 --> 00:09:58.340
because she actually has
quite a relatively sharp sense

00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.850
of humor, that it's not just
she's like incidentally funny

00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.276
because she's an Indian
woman living in America,

00:10:04.276 --> 00:10:06.650
and because she bumps up
against people she doesn't know.

00:10:06.650 --> 00:10:08.330
But in fact, she
can she can take

00:10:08.330 --> 00:10:10.131
what she knows about
the world and actually

00:10:10.131 --> 00:10:12.380
employ it in a certain way,
in the way that she writes

00:10:12.380 --> 00:10:13.879
about the world,
in the way that she

00:10:13.879 --> 00:10:15.740
interacts with
people, that is closer

00:10:15.740 --> 00:10:17.821
to her actual personality.

00:10:17.821 --> 00:10:19.820
It's like her personality
is caught in her head,

00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.350
but it's not in practice at all.

00:10:21.350 --> 00:10:23.570
So that's really-
I was exploring

00:10:23.570 --> 00:10:26.750
that with her character,
in terms of taking a really

00:10:26.750 --> 00:10:29.480
feminist stance in
a way, of how would

00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:32.570
she have come into
her own that way.

00:10:32.570 --> 00:10:34.610
And then the third main
narrative in the book

00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:38.280
is Prashant, her son, who
is a freshman in college.

00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:42.140
And in his case, because
he's kind of checked off

00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:43.850
all the boxes for
his family, he's

00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:48.140
very studious, he's a chemistry
student, he's very sharp.

00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:51.140
And he realizes
that because he's

00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:53.480
been dutiful in a lot of
ways, and because even when

00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:57.720
he's acted out, if he's like
smoked pot at some point,

00:10:57.720 --> 00:10:59.720
or if he's gotten drunk,
like during high school

00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:02.660
with his friends, that nothing
has really prepared him

00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:05.690
for the social interactions
he's going to have romantically

00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:06.750
in his life.

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:09.890
And so he develops a crush on
this kind of stereotypically

00:11:09.890 --> 00:11:12.620
beautiful and but then
like kind of darkly

00:11:12.620 --> 00:11:15.230
smart young woman in his
class, he has a crush on.

00:11:15.230 --> 00:11:17.660
And he realizes he
doesn't know at all how

00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:19.160
to engage with
anything romantic,

00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.535
because his parents have
set no example for him.

00:11:21.535 --> 00:11:22.910
So it's really
the three of them.

00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:26.540
And then the other key
character is Harit's mother,

00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:27.890
the first character I mentioned.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:32.080
His mother is-- later in
life, and you find out

00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:35.567
in a particular flashback scene
what the trajectory of her life

00:11:35.567 --> 00:11:36.650
has been up to that point.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:39.020
So it's really
looking at people who

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.750
are on the margins of
society and how they actually

00:11:41.750 --> 00:11:43.582
insert themselves
into the conversation

00:11:43.582 --> 00:11:45.290
willfully, as a result
of the things that

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:48.650
are happening around them,
and tons of gay stuff.

00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.640
Tons of gay people.

00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:53.150
MELISSA POULOS: That sounds
really funny, really beautiful,

00:11:53.150 --> 00:11:54.860
really sweet, touching story.

00:11:54.860 --> 00:11:55.550
It's incredible.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.633
And you mentioned at the
end of the acknowledgment

00:11:57.633 --> 00:11:59.840
how you credit
your husband, John,

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:01.640
how it started off
in a sad place,

00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.787
and has now ended up in
a very hopeful one, which

00:12:03.787 --> 00:12:05.870
I think was really lovely
at the end of the story.

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:07.411
And so many of the
themes in the book

00:12:07.411 --> 00:12:11.600
are so timely, sort of this idea
of loneliness and belonging,

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:15.170
and sort of identity
and feeling displaced,

00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:18.731
making unlikely
connections with people.

00:12:18.731 --> 00:12:21.230
And obviously so many of us can
relate to that, particularly

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.510
as being immigrants
ourselves, or being

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:26.010
children of immigrants
in this country

00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:27.560
and sort of how that feels.

00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:29.450
So the characters
are incredible.

00:12:29.450 --> 00:12:33.350
And I love how they all
sort of start off, it seems,

00:12:33.350 --> 00:12:36.470
suppressing aspects of
who they really are.

00:12:36.470 --> 00:12:38.660
And only through the
interactions and relationships

00:12:38.660 --> 00:12:42.800
with each other, they build
on, and bring out really,

00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.700
their own personalities by
playing off of on another.

00:12:45.700 --> 00:12:46.940
RAKESH SATYAL: I love that--
thank you for saying that,

00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:48.400
because really, that was the--

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.150
what I like to tell
people is when I first

00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:52.670
started writing the
Harit character,

00:12:52.670 --> 00:12:55.750
I was actually at a writing
residency in Provincetown,

00:12:55.750 --> 00:12:58.000
that Colin McCann, the amazing
novelist, Colin McCann,

00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.010
was running.

00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:00.469
And one of the
exercises he gave us

00:13:00.469 --> 00:13:02.676
in that class, which is
really instructive to anybody

00:13:02.676 --> 00:13:03.470
who is writing--

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:04.730
and I'm not sure if
this was an exercise

00:13:04.730 --> 00:13:07.354
that he created or it might have
been what he was passing along

00:13:07.354 --> 00:13:07.940
to us--

00:13:07.940 --> 00:13:09.595
and I happened to be
beginning to write

00:13:09.595 --> 00:13:10.720
that character at the time.

00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.511
This was in 2010, so
this gives you an idea

00:13:12.511 --> 00:13:13.610
of how long ago this was.

00:13:13.610 --> 00:13:19.130
And he said describe
the strangest person

00:13:19.130 --> 00:13:20.930
your character has ever met.

00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:22.310
And the challenge
of that is it's

00:13:22.310 --> 00:13:24.889
not the strangest
person you've ever met,

00:13:24.889 --> 00:13:26.930
it's the strangest person
your character has met.

00:13:26.930 --> 00:13:28.949
So it gives you a
certain challenge

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:30.740
to see the world through
that person's eyes

00:13:30.740 --> 00:13:32.281
and think about the
things that would

00:13:32.281 --> 00:13:34.910
be challenging or
confounding in a lot of ways

00:13:34.910 --> 00:13:36.560
and funny in a lot of ways.

00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:38.840
And that was really
fortuitous to happen

00:13:38.840 --> 00:13:40.830
at the beginning of
my writing process,

00:13:40.830 --> 00:13:43.164
because I knew already the
book was going to be composed

00:13:43.164 --> 00:13:44.705
of interactions like
that, that there

00:13:44.705 --> 00:13:46.340
were going to be
people who bumped up

00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:49.760
against each other who were of
completely different mindsets,

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:52.490
and that the comedy would result
from that misunderstanding.

00:13:52.490 --> 00:13:55.160
So that was very conscious
on my part to do that,

00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:57.020
and I'm glad that
you noticed that,

00:13:57.020 --> 00:13:59.610
because that's a real crux of
the book as you go through.

00:13:59.610 --> 00:14:00.740
MELISSA POULOS: So tell
us a little bit more

00:14:00.740 --> 00:14:03.270
about kind of where the
origin of the story came from,

00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:05.974
some of the characters
that we've heard about.

00:14:05.974 --> 00:14:07.640
I mean, I know you've
got a lot that you

00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:09.723
drew on from your own
experience, and your family,

00:14:09.723 --> 00:14:12.440
and sort of your own
parents, who are from India,

00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:15.290
and their kind of
romanticism about America.

00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:17.960
And maybe how that had
changed over the years.

00:14:17.960 --> 00:14:20.395
RAKESH SATYAL: Well,
at a certain point--

00:14:22.875 --> 00:14:24.500
years ago, my thesis
adviser, actually,

00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:26.458
when we were at Princeton,
was David Ebershoff,

00:14:26.458 --> 00:14:29.444
who is a wonderful novelist,
who, among other things,

00:14:29.444 --> 00:14:31.610
wrote the book that became,
"The Danish Girl," which

00:14:31.610 --> 00:14:33.170
became that amazing movie.

00:14:33.170 --> 00:14:36.062
And David gave me a
really amazing piece.

00:14:36.062 --> 00:14:37.520
And he was a
publishing mentor too,

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.530
because he's a very
brilliant editor.

00:14:39.530 --> 00:14:41.750
And he gave me a really
amazing pieces of advice

00:14:41.750 --> 00:14:45.860
when I was his advisee, where
he said just tell the story.

00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:48.320
Meaning, the way
I kind of explain

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:51.709
that now is that, if you've
been trained as a writer,

00:14:51.709 --> 00:14:53.750
if you've been writing,
if you've been exercising

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:56.670
that muscle so to speak,
at a certain point,

00:14:56.670 --> 00:14:59.750
you have to trust your
creative worldview,

00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:02.870
and your general world view of
how you see things, and tell

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:05.800
the story that you
really are meant to tell

00:15:05.800 --> 00:15:07.260
and that you're needing to tell.

00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:09.929
In a sense that I
kind of synthesized

00:15:09.929 --> 00:15:11.470
all these things
about what I learned

00:15:11.470 --> 00:15:14.094
from writing my first book, what
I've learned from my own life,

00:15:14.094 --> 00:15:16.210
what I've read and
learned from other people.

00:15:16.210 --> 00:15:20.050
And kind of thought, you
know, I can't get held up

00:15:20.050 --> 00:15:25.270
on checking off boxes
or trying to fill

00:15:25.270 --> 00:15:27.360
what I think are sort
of conventional ideas

00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.560
on what a novel should do
or what my fiction should

00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:32.050
be doing, but really
focus on these characters

00:15:32.050 --> 00:15:34.090
and see how I really
envision them.

00:15:34.090 --> 00:15:35.872
And in a way, the
Harit character

00:15:35.872 --> 00:15:37.580
had a real life
connection in that sense.

00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:40.114
But like Ranjana and
Prashant, and other people,

00:15:40.114 --> 00:15:42.280
they're really a synthesis
of all these other things

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:43.096
I brought in.

00:15:43.096 --> 00:15:44.470
And I really just
sort of trusted

00:15:44.470 --> 00:15:47.290
that to give me momentum
through the book.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.770
I was saying this earlier at an
event I did in May here in New

00:15:50.770 --> 00:15:52.630
York, and this is sort
of a shoddy metaphor,

00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:56.500
but I kind of think
of the writer's brain

00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.912
as being a crystal ball, and
you take a hammer, in a way,

00:15:59.912 --> 00:16:01.870
and you just take it and
you shatter that ball,

00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.340
and the shards go everywhere.

00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:05.050
And that's your book, in a way.

00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:06.550
Like all those
shards are characters

00:16:06.550 --> 00:16:07.930
that have come from your mind.

00:16:07.930 --> 00:16:09.700
And they all look
different, and they all

00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.950
are different sizes
and shapes, and they

00:16:11.950 --> 00:16:13.340
may reflect different things.

00:16:13.340 --> 00:16:16.300
But that's kind of
the way it happens.

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:18.100
It is part of you.

00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:21.490
And we say often that the more
dangerous thing than people's

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:23.950
assuming that the
main character is you,

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.160
is people assuming that every
character is you, so to speak.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.110
And in a way, they are, because
they're coming from your mind.

00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.040
But at a certain point you
have to trust your instincts

00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:35.482
and your creative verve
to be able to fashion that

00:16:35.482 --> 00:16:37.940
in a certain way, where it just
doesn't seem like you again

00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:39.865
and again.

00:16:39.865 --> 00:16:41.740
MELISSA POULOS: Should
we do a quick reading?

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.090
RAKESH SATYAL: Yeah, I'll
read from the very beginning.

00:16:44.090 --> 00:16:46.301
So no spoiler alerts here.

00:16:46.301 --> 00:16:47.550
Spoiler alert, you'll love it.

00:16:47.550 --> 00:16:48.175
No, I'm joking.

00:16:48.175 --> 00:16:49.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.210
So I'm just going to read from
the very beginning of the book.

00:16:53.210 --> 00:16:55.100
So here we go.

00:16:55.100 --> 00:16:57.940
"Harit descended the rubber
coated-stairs of the bus

00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:00.760
and tripped as he jumped
to the sidewalk below.

00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:02.860
He turned around to see
if anyone had noticed,

00:17:02.860 --> 00:17:04.900
but the bus was
already pulling away,

00:17:04.900 --> 00:17:07.930
leaving a dispersing
cloud of smoke and people.

00:17:07.930 --> 00:17:10.480
It was a short walk from
the bus stop to his house,

00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:13.180
but within 10 paces
he began to sweat.

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.719
The heat seems so hot here
because the surroundings

00:17:15.719 --> 00:17:17.260
didn't look as if
they could stand it

00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.970
any more than the residents.

00:17:18.970 --> 00:17:21.640
The thick roofs, many
shingled and arched,

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.099
the roads bracketed
in deep curbs,

00:17:24.099 --> 00:17:27.520
and the trees, branches bursting
and then shivering in leaves,

00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.210
were all suited to
a cold landscape.

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.740
Harit had seen this theory
proven during his first winter

00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.130
in Cleveland, when snow piled
on top of those shingles,

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:39.700
nestled into those curbs, and
spackled the leaves in ice.

00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.230
But in the summer,
the neighborhood

00:17:41.230 --> 00:17:45.460
seemed like a tired old man who
could not endure such exertion.

00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:48.580
The house in which Harit lived
stood opposite a large baseball

00:17:48.580 --> 00:17:49.420
field.

00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.730
The field was surrounded
by a sextet of light posts

00:17:51.730 --> 00:17:53.860
so large that they
could have constituted

00:17:53.860 --> 00:17:56.710
a new seven wonders of the world
had another counter-part been

00:17:56.710 --> 00:17:58.207
shoved into the ground.

00:17:58.207 --> 00:18:00.790
It seemed that a different group
of boys appeared on the field

00:18:00.790 --> 00:18:03.230
every night, clad
in uniforms of red,

00:18:03.230 --> 00:18:06.460
yellow, and gray polyester,
or during practice games,

00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.730
and assortment of
sweats and mesh.

00:18:08.730 --> 00:18:11.800
Their hollers would last until
9 PM, when the lights shut off

00:18:11.800 --> 00:18:13.750
with an ear-splitting pucker.

00:18:13.750 --> 00:18:15.700
The fields diamond was
on the opposite side

00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:18.100
of where the bus stopped
and Harit's house stood.

00:18:18.100 --> 00:18:20.505
So he didn't have to interact
with the kids very often.

00:18:20.505 --> 00:18:22.570
But there were those
afternoons when

00:18:22.570 --> 00:18:25.090
a ball would find its way to
Harit's side of the field,

00:18:25.090 --> 00:18:27.550
and some fragile little kid
would run over to get the ball

00:18:27.550 --> 00:18:29.350
and look terrified
that Harit was going

00:18:29.350 --> 00:18:31.090
to do something awful to him.

00:18:31.090 --> 00:18:33.574
There was that quick shake
of the head, a short no,

00:18:33.574 --> 00:18:34.990
and Harit, who
should have learned

00:18:34.990 --> 00:18:37.480
to look in front of himself
and not at others by now,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:38.950
would move away.

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.590
Today, thankfully, he had
an uneventful walk home,

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:44.140
and when he slid his key into
the back door of his house,

00:18:44.140 --> 00:18:45.844
he had one second of peace.

00:18:45.844 --> 00:18:47.260
But as soon as he
turned that key,

00:18:47.260 --> 00:18:49.630
it was time to get into costume.

00:18:49.630 --> 00:18:52.510
He wasn't sure why he put
the rose oil on anymore.

00:18:52.510 --> 00:18:54.580
It had seeped into
his skin by now.

00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:56.380
Teddy had already
sniffed him and asked him

00:18:56.380 --> 00:18:58.796
why he had started to smell
like someone named the Dowager

00:18:58.796 --> 00:19:00.726
Countess, who Harit
didn't know, but who

00:19:00.726 --> 00:19:02.350
according to the
tinny voice that Teddy

00:19:02.350 --> 00:19:05.274
used to say her name, sounded
like a very small woman.

00:19:05.274 --> 00:19:07.690
Harit cursed himself and he
remembered that he had run out

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:09.130
of lipstick yesterday.

00:19:09.130 --> 00:19:11.710
Luckily, he had a bit of
raspberry Chapstick left,

00:19:11.710 --> 00:19:13.540
and a few heavy circles
around his mouth

00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:14.650
pretty much did the trick.

00:19:14.650 --> 00:19:17.260
The sari that he'd been
using for the past week

00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:19.360
was beautiful, a peacock blue.

00:19:19.360 --> 00:19:21.250
But he had started
to smell in its folds

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:24.130
a stale version of his
own pungent body odor.

00:19:24.130 --> 00:19:26.680
He took the bottle of rose
oil against his index finger,

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:28.530
and trying not to
stain the fabric,

00:19:28.530 --> 00:19:30.806
flicked small droplets onto it.

00:19:30.806 --> 00:19:32.680
He then whipped the sari
into the air the way

00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.270
he did with his
blanket when making up

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.740
his bed in the morning.

00:19:35.740 --> 00:19:37.210
He sniffed the sari again.

00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:38.980
There was still the
unmistakable sourness,

00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:41.050
but the rose oil now
clouded it enough

00:19:41.050 --> 00:19:44.610
that his mother's old nostrils
would not detect the smell.

00:19:44.610 --> 00:19:46.360
She was in her armchair
in the living room

00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:47.970
and the stereo was going.

00:19:47.970 --> 00:19:50.500
Gital Didi had brought a new
batch of cassettes for her,

00:19:50.500 --> 00:19:52.120
and the latest one
was a Mohammad Rafi

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:53.740
Best Of collection.

00:19:53.740 --> 00:19:56.410
That voice, normally
lively, was so muffled

00:19:56.410 --> 00:19:58.284
by the old stereo
speakers, that it

00:19:58.284 --> 00:19:59.950
sounded as if poor
Muhammad himself were

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:02.020
trapped inside the machine.

00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:03.950
Harit, for all the
sadness of the situation,

00:20:03.950 --> 00:20:05.590
had to stifle a
laugh as he looked

00:20:05.590 --> 00:20:09.370
at his mother, the sentinel
of a caged mega-star singer.

00:20:09.370 --> 00:20:12.010
She had taken to wearing
a pair of" eyeglasses--

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:15.880
sorry, purple-- "gigantic,
purple-rimmed sunglasses,

00:20:15.880 --> 00:20:17.500
also a gift from Gital Didi--

00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:20.500
which made Harit's job
both easier and harder.

00:20:20.500 --> 00:20:23.290
Easier because they filtered out
such mistakes as his Chapstick

00:20:23.290 --> 00:20:25.810
lips, harder because they
made his mother even more

00:20:25.810 --> 00:20:28.000
inhuman and unapproachable.

00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.250
Her eyes, even under the
gossamer of burgeoning

00:20:30.250 --> 00:20:33.310
cataracts, were a pair of
darting, glimmering circles,

00:20:33.310 --> 00:20:35.549
that were abnormally
large for her face,

00:20:35.549 --> 00:20:37.840
and that have often made
people mistake her for a South

00:20:37.840 --> 00:20:39.700
Indian instead of a Punjabi.

00:20:39.700 --> 00:20:41.470
But now, with her
new eyewear, she'd

00:20:41.470 --> 00:20:43.810
become a wax figure
of herself, an effigy

00:20:43.810 --> 00:20:46.090
upon which some child
had played a prank.

00:20:46.090 --> 00:20:48.730
Still, something in her
defied total weakness.

00:20:48.730 --> 00:20:51.450
The way that her mottled
hands rested on the chairs arm

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:54.040
rests, the way that her
white sari, though jaundiced

00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:57.020
with time and over use, flowed
like the raiment of Saraswati.

00:20:57.020 --> 00:21:00.190
The way that her hair,
ghastly white, held its bun,

00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:02.170
save for a few to defiant wisps.

00:21:02.170 --> 00:21:05.770
It all emphasized her
determination to mourn forever.

00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:08.050
Is that you, his
mother asked in Hindi.

00:21:08.050 --> 00:21:10.000
It was always the first
thing that she said.

00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.650
She didn't speak
English anymore.

00:21:11.650 --> 00:21:14.430
And she used the informal
you in a childlike manner.

00:21:14.430 --> 00:21:16.420
Harit gave his usual response.

00:21:16.420 --> 00:21:19.092
Yes, Mother, it is Swati."

00:21:19.092 --> 00:21:20.660
I'll stop there.

00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.706
So what that
establishes is that--

00:21:24.706 --> 00:21:26.080
what's happening
in that scene is

00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.150
that you find out that
Harit's sister, Swati,

00:21:28.150 --> 00:21:31.630
who was his confidant,
and really only friend,

00:21:31.630 --> 00:21:34.320
has passed away, in a
circumstance that you

00:21:34.320 --> 00:21:35.600
find out later in the book.

00:21:35.600 --> 00:21:37.940
And so his mother, whose
eyesight is dimming,

00:21:37.940 --> 00:21:40.120
he thinks to kind of
keep them both sane,

00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:42.140
he will dress up in
her saris every night.

00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.570
So that's how the book begins.

00:21:43.570 --> 00:21:44.790
And that introduces
his character.

00:21:44.790 --> 00:21:45.250
MELISSA POULOS: It's great.

00:21:45.250 --> 00:21:46.250
It's really captivating.

00:21:46.250 --> 00:21:48.980
Because the description
is incredible.

00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.049
And then you're always
thinking what is going on.

00:21:51.049 --> 00:21:52.840
RAKESH SATYAL: It gets
funnier, by the way.

00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:54.756
It's like this is supposed
to be a funny book,

00:21:54.756 --> 00:21:56.370
they'll think that's
so depressing.

00:21:56.370 --> 00:21:57.430
MELISSA POULOS: It
is really funny.

00:21:57.430 --> 00:21:57.970
RAKESH SATYAL: We all felt bad.

00:21:57.970 --> 00:21:59.430
It was the feel bad of the year.

00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.290
MELISSA POULOS: One
last question from me,

00:22:05.290 --> 00:22:06.998
and then I'll open it
up to the audience.

00:22:06.998 --> 00:22:10.090
There's a lot of--

00:22:10.090 --> 00:22:12.040
some of the subplots
in the book talk

00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:17.140
about the Indian immigrant
community in this town.

00:22:17.140 --> 00:22:19.206
And then there are some
who are sort of outsiders

00:22:19.206 --> 00:22:20.080
to that, who come in.

00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:22.900
And I think you, I
would think, growing up

00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:25.970
kind of felt caught, kind
of between those two things.

00:22:25.970 --> 00:22:30.130
And how did you, yourself,
in writing this, as well,

00:22:30.130 --> 00:22:33.130
kind of reconcile that
idea of immigrant enclave,

00:22:33.130 --> 00:22:35.560
community, what
your parents know,

00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.380
and how they live
their life, versus

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:42.250
what became this very sort
of diverse, global lifestyle

00:22:42.250 --> 00:22:43.900
that you built for yourself.

00:22:43.900 --> 00:22:49.570
And maybe kind of how they
reacted to your evolution,

00:22:49.570 --> 00:22:51.580
away from what they
knew into something.

00:22:51.580 --> 00:22:53.370
RAKESH SATYAL: I mean, I often
say to people that I have--

00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.820
I'm in the very
luxurious position

00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.680
that nobody about
whom I care dearly,

00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.740
or whom I think to care
dearly about me, ever

00:22:59.740 --> 00:23:01.780
had a great issue
with my coming out.

00:23:01.780 --> 00:23:03.220
That it a luxury.

00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.767
I think, I'm not saying the
preponderance of people,

00:23:06.767 --> 00:23:09.100
but I think a number of South
Asian people in particular

00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.610
who come out don't necessarily
have that experience.

00:23:11.610 --> 00:23:13.640
My parents are
incredibly supportive.

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.840
The funny thing is
that they're actually--

00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:17.506
they had a love
marriage, which I

00:23:17.506 --> 00:23:18.880
didn't realize
how anomalous that

00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:21.310
was in our community
until much later actually.

00:23:21.310 --> 00:23:23.195
I thought there must
be other families that

00:23:23.195 --> 00:23:25.070
were in that same--
meaning, they didn't have

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.370
an arranged marriage, you know.

00:23:27.370 --> 00:23:30.100
And so they are a
bit more-- they've

00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:31.410
been progressive in a way.

00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:33.962
My fraternal twin brother,
who's a marketing executive

00:23:33.962 --> 00:23:35.670
at Heineken, and my
older brother, Rajiv,

00:23:35.670 --> 00:23:37.360
is a pretty successful
stand-up comic.

00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:39.490
So they've been very
encouraging of us.

00:23:39.490 --> 00:23:41.367
And I often say that a
lot of Indian parents

00:23:41.367 --> 00:23:43.450
will say do what we want
you to do and do it well.

00:23:43.450 --> 00:23:45.658
And they said do what you
want to do, but do it well,

00:23:45.658 --> 00:23:47.990
which is really helpful.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:55.330
But one of the things I was
very carefully and intentionally

00:23:55.330 --> 00:23:58.005
doing in the book was to
take these themes and tropes

00:23:58.005 --> 00:23:59.380
that we think of
as being, quote,

00:23:59.380 --> 00:24:01.510
unquote ethnic literature,
or quote, unquote,

00:24:01.510 --> 00:24:03.460
Indian-American
literature, and think

00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.549
about what I thought
was true and what

00:24:05.549 --> 00:24:07.090
I thought should be
subverted to show

00:24:07.090 --> 00:24:08.510
what I believed to be true.

00:24:08.510 --> 00:24:11.060
And so I did think about
the community a great deal.

00:24:11.060 --> 00:24:12.310
But what I didn't want to do--

00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:13.240
I was saying this to my
brother the other day-- was

00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:15.622
almost the difference
between saying

00:24:15.622 --> 00:24:17.080
what people want
you to say, what's

00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.121
the difference between
people who eat Indian food

00:24:19.121 --> 00:24:20.620
and who eat American food.

00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:23.290
And I was talking about what's
the difference between Indian

00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.335
people who eat Chipotle
versus like Ponderosa,

00:24:25.335 --> 00:24:26.710
or-- that didn't
make any sense--

00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:29.140
why am I even saying Ponderosa.

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.810
I'm from Ohio.

00:24:30.810 --> 00:24:33.310
But like you're having a
different conversation.

00:24:33.310 --> 00:24:34.690
Like we're a few generations in.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:36.370
Like it's not just that anymore.

00:24:36.370 --> 00:24:39.250
It's like how are people living
their Americanized lives,

00:24:39.250 --> 00:24:40.930
and to what actually
are they holding

00:24:40.930 --> 00:24:43.240
on to from their previous
culture, more so than coming

00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.309
at it the other way.

00:24:44.309 --> 00:24:45.850
So I definitely felt
a responsibility

00:24:45.850 --> 00:24:48.080
to depict that in a way
that I felt was accurate.

00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:50.065
But I didn't want to
just retread territory

00:24:50.065 --> 00:24:51.940
that I felt had been
tread before in fiction.

00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:54.189
Because, especially in the
queer elements of the book,

00:24:54.189 --> 00:24:56.410
I wanted to be true
to that narrative,

00:24:56.410 --> 00:24:58.280
because you don't
see that as much.

00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:01.420
And I wanted to kind of just
forge ahead and do that,

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.250
with the idea that
other people, especially

00:25:03.250 --> 00:25:06.615
with the comedic elements, the
book may take that and think

00:25:06.615 --> 00:25:08.990
about how they want to see
the world, either comedically,

00:25:08.990 --> 00:25:12.110
or a bit more progressively.

00:25:12.110 --> 00:25:14.530
MELISSA POULOS: Questions
from the audience.

00:25:14.530 --> 00:25:16.080
Anyone?

00:25:16.080 --> 00:25:17.890
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:25:17.890 --> 00:25:19.640
MELISSA POULOS: You
have to go to the mic.

00:25:19.640 --> 00:25:20.440
We're recording.

00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:21.100
Thanks, Henry.

00:25:30.370 --> 00:25:31.910
RAKESH SATYAL: Oh, hello.

00:25:33.844 --> 00:25:35.010
AUDIENCE: Hello, is this on?

00:25:35.010 --> 00:25:37.920
So my question is actually
around the business

00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:38.890
of book publishing.

00:25:38.890 --> 00:25:42.780
And as someone who sees
both the editor or editor,

00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:44.370
business side of
it, and then someone

00:25:44.370 --> 00:25:48.570
who creates a novel, how much
did that inform your process?

00:25:48.570 --> 00:25:50.580
Like I want to make
a successful book,

00:25:50.580 --> 00:25:53.190
I want to make good book
that can turn into a movie.

00:25:53.190 --> 00:25:54.780
How do you counsel
authors on that?

00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:56.640
And how did you take
your own advice?

00:25:56.640 --> 00:26:00.210
RAKESH SATYAL: Yeah,
what it's most helpful

00:26:00.210 --> 00:26:03.690
for on the creative end is
that I'm not necessarily

00:26:03.690 --> 00:26:05.634
taking those things
and saying, yeah,

00:26:05.634 --> 00:26:07.800
like I'm going to make this
commercially successful,

00:26:07.800 --> 00:26:10.169
or I'm going to make this
cinematic successful.

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:12.210
I'm definitely not doing
commercially successful,

00:26:12.210 --> 00:26:13.720
because there's
so much gay stuff,

00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:15.660
and it's like paced in
a very particular way.

00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:17.010
And I'm like, that was not--

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:19.440
but it gives you a perspective
on what's happening,

00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.190
what's happening in fiction,
what's happening industry wise,

00:26:22.190 --> 00:26:24.450
how are people reacting
to other books that

00:26:24.450 --> 00:26:27.090
purport to do this, or what are
other books that have come out

00:26:27.090 --> 00:26:29.215
in the past few years, and
how are they structured,

00:26:29.215 --> 00:26:32.310
and who went to
those books and why.

00:26:32.310 --> 00:26:34.324
I really-- I do
tell people this.

00:26:34.324 --> 00:26:35.490
And it seems like a cop out.

00:26:35.490 --> 00:26:37.500
But if you let
yourself be dictated

00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.300
by market concerns
like that, regardless

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.770
of your creative pursuit,
I just feel like it's

00:26:41.770 --> 00:26:43.560
a lose-lose situation.

00:26:43.560 --> 00:26:47.550
Because you're hemming in
whatever ideas you might have.

00:26:47.550 --> 00:26:52.010
Also there's no originality
that comes into play there.

00:26:52.010 --> 00:26:56.850
I think-- I tell my
authors a lot that

00:26:56.850 --> 00:26:59.520
write the book you would want
to read, but more so, entertain

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.132
yourself.

00:27:00.132 --> 00:27:02.340
Because you're sitting there
writing it all the time.

00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:05.760
And if you're not entertained,
and if you're getting

00:27:05.760 --> 00:27:06.260
frustrated--

00:27:06.260 --> 00:27:08.343
I mean, there's frustration
in the writing process

00:27:08.343 --> 00:27:08.850
to be sure--

00:27:08.850 --> 00:27:11.225
but if it's not entertaining
you and keeping you engaged,

00:27:11.225 --> 00:27:13.260
it's not going to
engage other people.

00:27:13.260 --> 00:27:18.150
So what the publishing
process helps, in the sense--

00:27:18.150 --> 00:27:19.920
going through the
production process,

00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:22.044
for example, like once you
go through copy editing,

00:27:22.044 --> 00:27:24.620
and you go through typesetting,
and cover considerations,

00:27:24.620 --> 00:27:26.370
and all those things
that come into play--

00:27:26.370 --> 00:27:28.830
I mean, I had the great luck
of having an amazing editor,

00:27:28.830 --> 00:27:31.020
whom I really trusted.

00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:32.500
I really trusted
her to do her job.

00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:35.000
And I didn't want to be that
person who worked in publishing

00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.450
telling her how to do her job.

00:27:36.450 --> 00:27:38.515
But that demystified
that process for me,

00:27:38.515 --> 00:27:40.890
because I think a lot of my
authors do get to that stage.

00:27:40.890 --> 00:27:42.060
Like I wrote the book.

00:27:42.060 --> 00:27:44.640
Thank god, now do
these 500 things

00:27:44.640 --> 00:27:46.220
that you have to do after that.

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.580
So it helps in that respect.

00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:52.100
But, certainly, you see--

00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.360
you got a view of
the industry, and how

00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:56.780
to engage people, and
get your work out there.

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:59.310
And especially have a
voice on social media,

00:27:59.310 --> 00:28:01.495
and how you engage people
when you do events,

00:28:01.495 --> 00:28:03.120
and how you do events,
all those things

00:28:03.120 --> 00:28:04.911
are very helpful when
you're in publishing.

00:28:04.911 --> 00:28:07.560
But I try to impart as much of
that as possible to the people

00:28:07.560 --> 00:28:10.007
with whom I work, so they
can benefit from that.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.730
AUDIENCE: You actually
started touching on this

00:28:17.730 --> 00:28:21.000
in the end of that answer.

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:24.540
In terms of how you get
your work out there and have

00:28:24.540 --> 00:28:27.180
a presence on social media,
can you talk a little bit

00:28:27.180 --> 00:28:30.270
about some of the things you've
done to promote your work,

00:28:30.270 --> 00:28:34.110
perhaps how you incorporated
your cabaret background,

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.850
or your singing,
just if there happens

00:28:35.850 --> 00:28:37.390
to be anything like that.

00:28:37.390 --> 00:28:41.610
But also just how you build
public presence and persona

00:28:41.610 --> 00:28:42.346
as a writer.

00:28:42.346 --> 00:28:44.220
RAKESH SATYAL: Well,
that's a great question.

00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:45.928
There's a term that
people use a lot now,

00:28:45.928 --> 00:28:50.850
which is being a good literary
citizen, the idea that if you

00:28:50.850 --> 00:28:52.860
want to write, and if
you want to be part

00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.090
of the world of
writing and publishing

00:28:54.090 --> 00:28:55.465
is you have to
read a great deal,

00:28:55.465 --> 00:28:57.600
and you have to support
the writers and the books

00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.250
that you really love.

00:28:59.250 --> 00:29:01.350
That is the wonderful
thing about social media,

00:29:01.350 --> 00:29:04.480
is that it's connected
people in that way.

00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.660
One writer who's
amazing, on Twitter,

00:29:06.660 --> 00:29:08.654
and she's just a lovely
person, Celeste Ng,

00:29:08.654 --> 00:29:10.320
who wrote this book,
"Everything I Never

00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:13.170
Told You," which is an amazing
book, and her new book,

00:29:13.170 --> 00:29:15.240
"Little Fires Everywhere,"
comes out this fall.

00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:17.650
And Celeste is just such
a warm, wonderful person.

00:29:17.650 --> 00:29:19.526
And she's so great
about vocalizing

00:29:19.526 --> 00:29:21.150
her support of other
authors, and using

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:22.920
the platform she has
a successful author

00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:25.530
to support people's writing.

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:27.590
I knew her only a little
bit through Twitter,

00:29:27.590 --> 00:29:30.090
and she was very kind to give
me a quote for the book, which

00:29:30.090 --> 00:29:30.780
was wonderful.

00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.960
And it was that kind of
idea, being connected to her,

00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.590
because we are fans of each
other's work, and writing,

00:29:37.590 --> 00:29:39.090
and senses of humor.

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:40.564
And so it's great to be online.

00:29:40.564 --> 00:29:42.480
When you read a book,
and you really enjoy it,

00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:44.280
I think sometimes people
think, you know, I read it,

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.500
and I really enjoyed that.

00:29:45.500 --> 00:29:47.740
Sometimes, you know,
send the author--

00:29:47.740 --> 00:29:49.926
tweet the author, or
find the author's email,

00:29:49.926 --> 00:29:52.050
or send a note to the
author's agent, or something,

00:29:52.050 --> 00:29:54.955
because people really
love that, to hear

00:29:54.955 --> 00:29:56.580
that something
connected with somebody,

00:29:56.580 --> 00:29:58.879
that that's an invaluable
thing as a writer.

00:29:58.879 --> 00:30:00.420
So I think that's
definitely one way,

00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.711
is to kind of be in that world.

00:30:01.711 --> 00:30:04.632
And I tell people
if you're a writer,

00:30:04.632 --> 00:30:06.840
and you're trying to figure
out how to find an agent,

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.150
read the acknowledgements
of the books that you enjoy.

00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:10.590
And they'll usually
thank their agents there.

00:30:10.590 --> 00:30:13.050
And that gives you an idea
of who is working with whom,

00:30:13.050 --> 00:30:14.400
and how that works.

00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.840
And the cabaret thing, to
debase myself completely,

00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:21.420
if you Google me, look
on YouTube, it's probably

00:30:21.420 --> 00:30:25.290
the first thing that pops up,
I did a Hamilton themed book

00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.590
trailer for this book, where I
sang the song "You'll be Back,"

00:30:28.590 --> 00:30:30.460
in Hamilton, but I
made it by my book.

00:30:30.460 --> 00:30:33.440
So if you find that, you'll find
me wearing a really ridiculous

00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440
outfit and singing that.

00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:36.865
So I try to bring
that to bear as well.

00:30:36.865 --> 00:30:39.240
But really, the thing is we've
learned in publishing too,

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.110
is that the idea of the old
school book tour reading

00:30:43.110 --> 00:30:43.985
doesn't work as much.

00:30:43.985 --> 00:30:46.443
Like people think I'll set an
event, and I'll do something,

00:30:46.443 --> 00:30:47.400
and people will come.

00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:49.140
And the truth is you
have to engage with it.

00:30:49.140 --> 00:30:50.370
Like you have to go
places where you know

00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.170
people, where you
can bring people.

00:30:52.170 --> 00:30:55.500
And do something aside from
just a typical reading.

00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.190
Even I, I'm a novelist,
I work in publishing,

00:30:59.190 --> 00:31:01.710
my attention span after
five minutes has a tendency

00:31:01.710 --> 00:31:03.640
to dissipate, and
I'm in that world.

00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.089
So the more you can do
something where you do

00:31:06.089 --> 00:31:07.380
something besides just reading.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:12.162
If you sing, if you give a
special talk about a topic

00:31:12.162 --> 00:31:13.620
that really means
something to you.

00:31:13.620 --> 00:31:15.480
If you talk about other
things in your life

00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:17.160
that are really important
that inform the process,

00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:19.384
that has a way of opening
up the world of the book

00:31:19.384 --> 00:31:20.050
to other people.

00:31:23.650 --> 00:31:25.511
AUDIENCE: Hi, thanks
for coming today.

00:31:25.511 --> 00:31:27.760
My question is actually
related to the first question.

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.710
Also about the
business, because you've

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:32.990
been on both sides of
the aisle, so to speak.

00:31:32.990 --> 00:31:39.240
With a lot of Indian and
South Asian stars and themes

00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:41.250
coming into the forefront,
in terms of TV shows,

00:31:41.250 --> 00:31:44.622
like "Mindy
Project," "Quantico,"

00:31:44.622 --> 00:31:46.080
"Master of None,"
and documentaries

00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:52.512
like, "Meet the Patels," have
you noticed that your work is

00:31:52.512 --> 00:31:54.720
being optioned differently,
or people are treating it

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:57.926
differently now than
your first book, say?

00:31:57.926 --> 00:31:59.800
RAKESH SATYAL: That's
a really good question,

00:31:59.800 --> 00:32:06.660
if that kind of sea change
has allowed that to happen.

00:32:06.660 --> 00:32:09.180
What I appreciate about a
great number of the things

00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:13.755
that you mentioned is that a lot
of them actually are comedic.

00:32:13.755 --> 00:32:16.380
Because to go back to my earlier
point about some of the themes

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:17.796
I was exploring
when I was writing

00:32:17.796 --> 00:32:21.442
the book is that from my
kind of life research, when

00:32:21.442 --> 00:32:23.400
I was thinking about the
category, what I found

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.820
is that what I saw as the
prevailing narrative was

00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:30.030
that most immigrant
literature, and especially

00:32:30.030 --> 00:32:32.580
South Asian literature,
focus on a grief narrative,

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:35.157
that there be something really
sad happening in the book.

00:32:35.157 --> 00:32:36.990
And that regardless of
any moments of levity

00:32:36.990 --> 00:32:40.290
that happened in the
book, that default sadness

00:32:40.290 --> 00:32:43.560
is the most viable emotion.

00:32:43.560 --> 00:32:45.720
And what I did,
very consciously,

00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:48.900
as you can see with the
laugh out loud funny section

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.700
that I read at the
beginning, is that is

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:53.310
that I was taking
actually that idea

00:32:53.310 --> 00:32:56.440
and then taking
it somewhere else.

00:32:56.440 --> 00:32:58.350
And so what I do
appreciate is this idea--

00:32:58.350 --> 00:33:02.380
I think most people's lives,
even when there's trauma,

00:33:02.380 --> 00:33:05.100
your default state is not
necessarily the trauma.

00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:07.440
It's the mundane things in
life, and the little things

00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:09.930
that happen to you over the
course of the day that actually

00:33:09.930 --> 00:33:12.210
have comedy in them,
or confusion in them,

00:33:12.210 --> 00:33:15.480
or self-reflection in them, in
a different way besides simply

00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:17.827
sadness, or effacing yourself.

00:33:17.827 --> 00:33:20.160
So what I appreciate about
all the things you mentioned,

00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.630
is that people do
have a tendency

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:23.445
to come to and
understand that, oh, I

00:33:23.445 --> 00:33:24.570
see what you're doing here.

00:33:24.570 --> 00:33:27.810
It's not just falling into
this rote emotional state,

00:33:27.810 --> 00:33:31.440
but in fact, there's
a wider world

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.360
emotionally than what we
typically give people.

00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.120
And I hope that
continues to happen.

00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:39.070
I am very heartened to see--
there was that picture.

00:33:39.070 --> 00:33:40.020
I'm so geeked out.

00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.728
There was that picture
from the Met Ball,

00:33:41.728 --> 00:33:46.482
where it was Riz Ahmed, Hussein
Bin Haj, Azus Ansari and Mindy

00:33:46.482 --> 00:33:47.940
Kaling, all in the
same photo, just

00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:49.320
like baller at the Met Ball.

00:33:49.320 --> 00:33:51.990
And I was like that's so
great, that's how it should be.

00:33:51.990 --> 00:33:55.080
It should be people representing
different backgrounds

00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.080
and having that different
cultural conversation.

00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:57.960
So I really--

00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:00.720
I do think people
are doing that now.

00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:03.330
And that it's by building
it over time that you see

00:34:03.330 --> 00:34:05.190
it come to fruition that way.

00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:12.810
AUDIENCE: Hi, Rakesh,
thanks for coming.

00:34:12.810 --> 00:34:14.880
I had a question about
the industry overall.

00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.820
And again, as people
have asked, you

00:34:17.820 --> 00:34:21.070
have this unique
position of being

00:34:21.070 --> 00:34:23.540
across the various
aspects of the industry,

00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:24.840
a writer, publisher.

00:34:24.840 --> 00:34:28.530
Actually, pre-question is, is
that common across writers,

00:34:28.530 --> 00:34:29.219
to be--

00:34:29.219 --> 00:34:31.260
RAKESH SATYAL: There are
people, like you usually

00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:32.630
know who they are.

00:34:32.630 --> 00:34:35.540
They're like spread out
through the industry.

00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.100
But there are a few of us, yeah.

00:34:37.100 --> 00:34:38.040
There are a few of us.

00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:38.540
And

00:34:38.540 --> 00:34:40.139
AUDIENCE: The second
question is what

00:34:40.139 --> 00:34:42.270
do you think the future of
the industry looks like?

00:34:42.270 --> 00:34:45.060
And will publishers
get disintermediated?

00:34:45.060 --> 00:34:47.630
And how does that affect
the quality of the book?

00:34:47.630 --> 00:34:50.460
And will that, for
example, proliferate

00:34:50.460 --> 00:34:53.789
the emergence of more writers?

00:34:53.789 --> 00:34:56.330
RAKESH SATYAL: Thank you for
the most Google question of all.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:02.850
Everybody knows that publishing
in general, across spectra,

00:35:02.850 --> 00:35:05.559
regardless of what medium
you're in within that industry,

00:35:05.559 --> 00:35:07.350
is always going to be
volatile in some way.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:15.340
So that is a kind of a priori
fact of being in the industry.

00:35:15.340 --> 00:35:17.850
I do think we are in a
particularly exciting time.

00:35:17.850 --> 00:35:20.070
Because I will say, like
I just did a two week book

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.310
tour, where I went and did
like eight or nine events.

00:35:23.310 --> 00:35:25.410
And most of those events
were in indie bookstores.

00:35:25.410 --> 00:35:28.020
And we hear about this in
the industry, the resurgence

00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:29.340
of the indie bookstore.

00:35:29.340 --> 00:35:29.924
And it's true.

00:35:29.924 --> 00:35:31.340
I mean, like you
see it happening.

00:35:31.340 --> 00:35:32.640
You see it in New York.

00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:35.810
There's Greenlight
in Fort Greene.

00:35:35.810 --> 00:35:37.540
There's Word bookstore
in Greenpoint.

00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:38.040
It's there.

00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:40.540
They have another location they
opened in Jersey City, which

00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:41.100
is amazing.

00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:43.380
There's Books are Magic,
Emma Straub's new store.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.740
There's the second Greenlight
location in Lefferts Gardens.

00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:53.070
So it's-- so those stores are
becoming-- what they did is,

00:35:53.070 --> 00:35:55.302
they really saw the moment
to have a cultural center

00:35:55.302 --> 00:35:56.010
at the bookstore.

00:35:56.010 --> 00:35:57.840
Like that was what it was
like when I think a lot of us

00:35:57.840 --> 00:35:59.798
were growing up, was you
went to the bookstore.

00:35:59.798 --> 00:36:01.962
And then there was this
moment where places closed,

00:36:01.962 --> 00:36:04.170
and chains closed, and
Borders closed, and you really

00:36:04.170 --> 00:36:04.878
worried about it.

00:36:04.878 --> 00:36:08.260
And now, people are kind of
taking into their own hands

00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.080
and saying, we can
build a community here.

00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:12.870
And to my earlier point, a
lot of the reasons why that--

00:36:12.870 --> 00:36:14.580
one of the reasons
why that works

00:36:14.580 --> 00:36:16.891
is because the programming
has become central to them.

00:36:16.891 --> 00:36:19.140
We'll get authors to come
here and speak about things,

00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:20.790
and we'll do events here,
and we'll do kids events,

00:36:20.790 --> 00:36:22.873
and we'll bring in people
of different backgrounds

00:36:22.873 --> 00:36:26.160
to actually be on site and talk
about books in a different way.

00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:29.750
And that has made that
sector of publishing

00:36:29.750 --> 00:36:32.310
all the more appealing to
people and all the more

00:36:32.310 --> 00:36:34.010
vital to everything.

00:36:34.010 --> 00:36:35.010
So that's very exciting.

00:36:35.010 --> 00:36:36.760
And then what we
saw is this idea

00:36:36.760 --> 00:36:38.784
that a few years
ago this great fear

00:36:38.784 --> 00:36:40.200
that everything
would turn digital

00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:42.116
and that ebooks would
just eclipse everything.

00:36:42.116 --> 00:36:44.550
And now we've seen it even
out in a way, where people do

00:36:44.550 --> 00:36:46.000
care about the physical book.

00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.820
I mean, I certainly do.

00:36:47.820 --> 00:36:49.370
And I love to--

00:36:49.370 --> 00:36:51.630
I'm like, hold this
actual book in your hands.

00:36:51.630 --> 00:36:54.880
Like it looks beautiful.

00:36:54.880 --> 00:36:57.330
So people are
becoming-- publishers

00:36:57.330 --> 00:36:59.430
are becoming savvy about
how to play with format,

00:36:59.430 --> 00:37:02.400
and packaging, and
engaging people visually

00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:03.930
in a certain way
that's different.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:08.460
I should say where I work,
Atria Books, our publisher,

00:37:08.460 --> 00:37:11.880
Judith Curry, is a complete
visionary, where the imprint

00:37:11.880 --> 00:37:14.430
itself is celebrating its
50th year, and she began it.

00:37:14.430 --> 00:37:18.144
And her kind of porousness in
terms of how she thinks about

00:37:18.144 --> 00:37:20.310
how we package books, and
how we get them to market,

00:37:20.310 --> 00:37:24.720
and how we engage digitally with
different formats, and apps,

00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:26.490
it's so forward thinking
that it gives me

00:37:26.490 --> 00:37:28.020
great hope for what
people are going

00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:31.140
to be able to going forward.

00:37:31.140 --> 00:37:33.090
So I think it just takes--

00:37:33.090 --> 00:37:35.310
I would love to
see inroads between

00:37:35.310 --> 00:37:36.780
nontraditional
publishing thinking

00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.238
and traditional
publishing thinking

00:37:38.238 --> 00:37:40.100
to bring them all together.

00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:43.390
And I think that's only going
to help people over time.

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:47.190
So I know that seems very
kind of like overly optimistic

00:37:47.190 --> 00:37:48.780
in a way, but I
do think you have

00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.420
to lead creatively in that way.

00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:53.100
Like the thing with the books
is in an editorial meeting, when

00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:57.420
we're sitting there, we have
to feel really passionately

00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:58.590
editorially about something.

00:37:58.590 --> 00:38:00.215
And the content and
the creative really

00:38:00.215 --> 00:38:03.180
has to be there so that other
people can understand that.

00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.430
I often said the editor's
job traffics in trickle

00:38:05.430 --> 00:38:08.070
down enthusiasm, because
you are a liaison

00:38:08.070 --> 00:38:10.230
among all the divisions
of the publishing company.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:13.080
As an editor, I'm talking to
sales, publicity, marketing,

00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.650
and then the eventual reader.

00:38:14.650 --> 00:38:17.070
So your enthusiasm
has to be so great,

00:38:17.070 --> 00:38:19.680
that as you give it to
other people, they take it

00:38:19.680 --> 00:38:21.510
and run with it.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.940
So if the editors are really
looking for that content

00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:27.660
and seeing great creative work
being done, and champion it,

00:38:27.660 --> 00:38:31.162
then that will always be
a constant in publishing.

00:38:33.449 --> 00:38:34.740
MELISSA POULOS: More questions?

00:38:39.030 --> 00:38:40.890
AUDIENCE: So I guess
I wanted to ask you

00:38:40.890 --> 00:38:44.430
because you are both an
editor and a writer, what

00:38:44.430 --> 00:38:50.250
was your editor's, I
guess, biggest comment,

00:38:50.250 --> 00:38:53.790
and I'm sure he or she had
many, but what was their biggest

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.840
overall feedback for you?

00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:58.587
And was there anything
that you disagreed with?

00:38:58.587 --> 00:39:00.420
RAKESH SATYAL: Oh, no,
there was no editing.

00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:02.430
It was perfect.

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:04.560
My editor, Anna
deVries, is a genius.

00:39:04.560 --> 00:39:09.609
And the lesson I really
learned from her, that I've

00:39:09.609 --> 00:39:11.400
been trouble with with
a lot of my writers,

00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:14.070
is a lot of the times
when you write something,

00:39:14.070 --> 00:39:15.880
even when you've revised
it and revised it,

00:39:15.880 --> 00:39:17.370
you know something
isn't working,

00:39:17.370 --> 00:39:20.360
but you just don't want to
admit it because it's more work.

00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:21.696
Here comes laziness again.

00:39:21.696 --> 00:39:23.070
You could feel
like, I don't want

00:39:23.070 --> 00:39:26.550
to do that, I have this creative
vision and I will stand by it.

00:39:26.550 --> 00:39:30.630
So the book is told in very
alternating narratives.

00:39:30.630 --> 00:39:33.830
And it's paced very consciously,
almost like it's a sitcom.

00:39:33.830 --> 00:39:36.610
It's cutting among
the various narratives

00:39:36.610 --> 00:39:37.990
over the course of the book.

00:39:37.990 --> 00:39:39.859
And originally when
I did the book,

00:39:39.859 --> 00:39:41.400
there's three main
narratives, that I

00:39:41.400 --> 00:39:42.524
mentioned at the beginning.

00:39:42.524 --> 00:39:44.483
It was a really long
chunk about the first one,

00:39:44.483 --> 00:39:46.357
and a really long chunk
about the second one,

00:39:46.357 --> 00:39:47.915
and a really chunk
about the third.

00:39:47.915 --> 00:39:50.040
And then, a third of the
way through the book, they

00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:50.880
were braided together.

00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:52.590
And then things started
happening that way.

00:39:52.590 --> 00:39:54.089
And she just kind
of said to me, she

00:39:54.089 --> 00:39:56.157
was like you realize that
it should be like that

00:39:56.157 --> 00:39:57.240
from the beginning, right?

00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.050
And I knew that.

00:39:58.050 --> 00:39:59.340
I completely knew that.

00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:02.070
It just took more editing
and I was just so--

00:40:02.070 --> 00:40:03.300
I'd worked so long on it.

00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:06.275
And I just was like, no,
this is like avant garde,

00:40:06.275 --> 00:40:08.400
like you're just pulled
into the worlds separately,

00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.020
and then you're amazed
when it comes together.

00:40:10.020 --> 00:40:11.350
And she was like, really?

00:40:11.350 --> 00:40:16.562
So that was like the most
helpful note in a way.

00:40:16.562 --> 00:40:19.020
There wasn't much-- I really
don't think there was anything

00:40:19.020 --> 00:40:20.103
we really disagreed about.

00:40:20.103 --> 00:40:24.630
There was one section,
of a few pages, where

00:40:24.630 --> 00:40:26.775
I felt an obligation to
keep that section in,

00:40:26.775 --> 00:40:28.320
because it was about one
of the younger characters,

00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:29.861
and it was about a
moment in his life

00:40:29.861 --> 00:40:32.160
where he's sort
of feeling adrift.

00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:33.660
And it really drives
home the point

00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:35.905
about just how romantically
clueless he is.

00:40:35.905 --> 00:40:37.530
And that was a short
section I kept in.

00:40:37.530 --> 00:40:39.210
But as soon as I told her
that I'd like to keep that in,

00:40:39.210 --> 00:40:41.376
she was like I completely
get why you're doing that.

00:40:41.376 --> 00:40:43.839
So it's a very--

00:40:43.839 --> 00:40:45.630
you have to trust your
editor a great deal.

00:40:45.630 --> 00:40:47.700
And I really trusted her.

00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:51.049
And if-- and she was
very mindful of what

00:40:51.049 --> 00:40:53.340
I was trying to do creatively,
the fact that there were

00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.140
certain themes,
especially queer themes,

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:57.056
I was not going to budge
on, and she would not

00:40:57.056 --> 00:40:58.290
wanted to have budged on.

00:40:58.290 --> 00:40:59.760
Wow, there's a conjugation.

00:40:59.760 --> 00:41:02.880
So like it was very
beneficial to work with her

00:41:02.880 --> 00:41:04.857
and have that
connection with her.

00:41:04.857 --> 00:41:07.190
MELISSA POULOS: One last
question, I think we have time.

00:41:07.190 --> 00:41:08.898
AUDIENCE: It's been
eight years since you

00:41:08.898 --> 00:41:10.210
wrote your first book.

00:41:10.210 --> 00:41:12.290
Now when I look back
at things I wrote

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.645
years ago, I always
read them and think,

00:41:14.645 --> 00:41:16.440
am I even the same person?

00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.800
So I'm wondering what has
changed about your writing

00:41:18.800 --> 00:41:20.960
style?

00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.260
If you read your
first book recently,

00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.550
do you look at it like,
whoa, like my writing style

00:41:25.550 --> 00:41:26.330
has changed a lot?

00:41:26.330 --> 00:41:29.710
And if so, what has changed?

00:41:29.710 --> 00:41:32.820
RAKESH SATYAL: I think
about that a lot.

00:41:32.820 --> 00:41:34.430
And then I stopped
thinking about it,

00:41:34.430 --> 00:41:36.840
because it drives me insane.

00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:39.797
I think what it is--

00:41:39.797 --> 00:41:41.630
what I've heard from a
lot of people, who've

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:44.270
read the book, which
I greatly appreciate,

00:41:44.270 --> 00:41:46.550
there's great warmth in it.

00:41:46.550 --> 00:41:48.164
And the way my--

00:41:48.164 --> 00:41:50.330
I kind of subconsciously
thought about it this way--

00:41:50.330 --> 00:41:51.746
but the way my
editor describes is

00:41:51.746 --> 00:41:54.640
there's great compassion
for the characters.

00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:57.140
And that and that was incredibly
key to me as I was writing.

00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:00.480
And I wanted there to be
that level of empathy.

00:42:00.480 --> 00:42:05.880
But I think that's the way I
will always approach writing.

00:42:05.880 --> 00:42:08.330
And the thing I keep telling
people is the lesson I really

00:42:08.330 --> 00:42:10.726
learn with this book,
and is evidenced

00:42:10.726 --> 00:42:12.350
in the first book
from a long time ago,

00:42:12.350 --> 00:42:14.766
is that my writing is really
often about who is happening,

00:42:14.766 --> 00:42:16.100
not what is happening.

00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:18.277
Because I find that those--

00:42:18.277 --> 00:42:20.360
in the book, for example,
I was talking about some

00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:22.370
of those mundane things
that happen in life.

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.140
In the book, there's
a certain rhythm

00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.600
where a character will be
doing something-- like this

00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:27.200
happens many times in the book.

00:42:27.200 --> 00:42:29.690
A certain character will be
doing something very mundane,

00:42:29.690 --> 00:42:31.981
like driving somewhere, or
cooking something, or eating

00:42:31.981 --> 00:42:32.660
something.

00:42:32.660 --> 00:42:35.000
And then there's almost a
disposition at the end of it

00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:37.820
where it's punctuated by
the interior monologue that

00:42:37.820 --> 00:42:41.540
was happening to that character
while that scene was happening.

00:42:41.540 --> 00:42:45.680
And to me, and to your point
earlier, one of the things

00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.490
I was looking at, a key theme in
the book was, if you're lonely,

00:42:49.490 --> 00:42:52.160
and you feel your
loneliness palpably,

00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.620
that in fact, loneliness
can be incredibly construct.

00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:57.900
That in a way, when you're
alone with your thoughts, that's

00:42:57.900 --> 00:43:00.140
when you do some of your
most productive thinking,

00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:01.806
and your most productive
self-reflection

00:43:01.806 --> 00:43:04.030
to figure out what you
actually value in the world,

00:43:04.030 --> 00:43:07.100
and what you think you
might change about yourself,

00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:08.460
or examine about yourself.

00:43:08.460 --> 00:43:10.850
So I think that's
something I've noticed,

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:16.340
is that I feel a bit more
validated, and enthused,

00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:21.800
and verified in a way
to sort of do that.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.870
Like my writing has a
certain warmth to it,

00:43:23.870 --> 00:43:26.930
and a certain compassion,
and humor to it.

00:43:26.930 --> 00:43:28.130
And I'm leading with that.

00:43:28.130 --> 00:43:29.610
That's not incidental
to what I'm doing.

00:43:29.610 --> 00:43:31.234
But it's actually
quite central to what

00:43:31.234 --> 00:43:33.649
my goals are as a writer.

00:43:33.649 --> 00:43:35.940
MELISSA POULOS: Well, thank
you so much for being here.

00:43:35.940 --> 00:43:36.870
RAKESH SATYAL: Thank you
very much, everybody,

00:43:36.870 --> 00:43:37.520
for being here.

00:43:37.520 --> 00:43:41.009
MELISSA POULOS: We have
books for sale at the back.

00:43:41.009 --> 00:43:42.800
And we're wishing you
the best for tonight.

00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.760
Rakesh is actually going to be
on Late Night with Seth Meyers

00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.301
this evening.

00:43:45.301 --> 00:43:47.010
So tune in.

00:43:47.010 --> 00:43:49.620
Follow him, check out the book.

00:43:49.620 --> 00:43:51.682
And I wanted to
close with something

00:43:51.682 --> 00:43:53.640
that I thought was so
inspiring that you shared

00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:56.430
on Twitter a couple weeks ago,
when we were actually together

00:43:56.430 --> 00:43:59.240
that weekend at our
college reunion.

00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.370
And you said grew up in Ohio,
somehow got into Princeton.

00:44:02.370 --> 00:44:04.470
Here for my 15th
reunion with my hubby

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:06.210
and read from my second book.

00:44:06.210 --> 00:44:09.015
Dream big my LGBTQ children.

00:44:09.015 --> 00:44:10.890
Like so amazing.

00:44:10.890 --> 00:44:12.580
So, thank you so
much for being here.

00:44:12.580 --> 00:44:12.960
I really appreciate it.

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:13.860
RAKESH SATYAL:
Thank you very much.

00:44:13.860 --> 00:44:14.359
Thank you.

00:44:14.359 --> 00:44:17.810
[APPLAUSE]
