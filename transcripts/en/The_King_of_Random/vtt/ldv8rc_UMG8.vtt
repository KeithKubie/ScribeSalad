[Captioned via Y Translator]
Guys, we've been working
on something big,

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:04.700
and we are excited to unveil it
in just a couple of weeks

00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:05.400
once everything is ready.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.200
In the meantime,
we want to hear your guesses

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.340
about what it is.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:11.760
The first person who guesses it
correctly will get it for free.

00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:16.800
Post your guesses down in the comments,
and start using the #TKORCreator

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.900
so your guesses are
seen on social media.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.680
Also, if you click the link

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:33.360
[Music]

00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:35.500
Hey guys, today, we are here
with my friend Joseph,

00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.800
and we're going to do something
that a lot of you have asked about.

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.700
We are going to do
some introductory blacksmithing.

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:43.900
Now Joseph, tell us about what
blacksmithing experience you have.

00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.100
Well, I first got into it when
I was 11 by reading books.

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:49.800
I found a reference in a book
to an old way the blacksmith's

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:54.000
practice, which is to forge clay,
which does not require the hot fire

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.400
or any of the dangerous stuff.

00:00:55.400 --> 00:00:57.412
And so it's a really good way
to start in your kitchen.

00:00:57.412 --> 00:00:59.820
We'll take some refrigerated
oil-based clay,

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:01.992
and learn some basic
blacksmithing techniques.

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.900
Once we've got those techniques down,
we'll use our backyard foundry

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:06.500
as a furnace,
and apply what we've learned

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:08.100
to some real iron.

00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.700
All right, so we are going to show
you a little bit of blacksmithing

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:13.400
with real metal and real fire.

00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:16.000
But then we're also going to show you
Joseph's practicing method where you

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.800
use oil-based clay that
you have refrigerated

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.132
and the tools are the same.

00:01:20.132 --> 00:01:22.400
Yup, tools are exactly the same,
and the techniques are exactly the same.

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:25.300
Cool thing about Clay is
actually a really good analog

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.200
for the way hot metal behaves,

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:29.440
and so you can learn how to forge
tapers and to do upsetting,

00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:31.200
to punch and do all the stuff,

00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:33.100
and it's actually less
forgiving than iron,

00:01:33.100 --> 00:01:36.460
and so it's a really good way to practice
and see where you're making mistakes.

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:37.000
Brilliant.

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.900
So, all right,
talk about the tools.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:41.800
Okay, so hammers have a couple
of different faces.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:44.000
Typically you'll have a face
of the hammer which is flat,

00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.200
and then you have a back-end
which does something else.

00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.500
This will flatten metal in all directions,
and so, as you squish the metal,

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:53.000
it's going to squish this way,
and this way.

00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:55.600
The most common type
of blacksmithing hammer

00:01:55.600 --> 00:01:58.100
is called a cross peen hammer,
and this thing is insanely useful,

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:01.300
because this back end,
when you hit metal with it, is only

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.500
going to spread metal in this axis,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.800
and a lot less in this axis,
which is really good

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:08.600
for stretching out metal
in areas where you want it.

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.700
You also have straight peens,
which have the same kind

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.100
of chisel shape just done vertically.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:14.900
This is a crossbeam.
I found one.

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:15.540
Yeah.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:16.600
This one is a ball-peen.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.200
You've probably seen this type before,
and this one is useful for dishing

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:23.900
and making spoons, and it's more
of an aggressive spread of metal

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:25.380
at one kind of point.

00:02:25.380 --> 00:02:27.200
And this is an anvil.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:28.200
What is this made of?

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.162
This is a Harbor
Freight junk Anvil.

00:02:30.262 --> 00:02:31.912
Do you know is
this iron or steel

00:02:31.912 --> 00:02:33.000
or?
This is cast iron.

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.140
How much does
this anvil weight?

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:35.980
This anvil 55 pounds.

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:38.080
I'm so strong.

00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:40.800
55 pounds.

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:41.700
Oh wow.

00:02:41.700 --> 00:02:44.740
So we have our 55-pound cast iron anvil,

00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:46.000
a variety of hammers.

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.900
Maybe let's try a little bit
of room temperature clay,

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.000
and then we'll move
to the refrigerated clay,

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:51.600
which is more like the actual metal.

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.882
And then we'll eventually
move up to the actual metal.

00:02:54.692 --> 00:02:56.200
Oil-based clay, and so,

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.622
this is just the stuff that you can get
at like a craft store, right?

00:02:58.622 --> 00:02:58.982
Yes.

00:02:58.982 --> 00:02:59.252
Yes.

00:02:59.252 --> 00:03:01.100
This is the stuff that
kids can play with.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:02.000
Bright colored stuff.

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.900
And this is, when
you would say oil-based,

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.800
you mean that this is a thick
probably about the consistency

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:10.000
of petroleum jelly type
of oil with a substrate in it,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.400
and this doesn't dry out
because this has no water

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:14.300
in it to dry out.

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.400
You could leave this out for a year,
and it would get dusty,

00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.900
but it would still
be pretty much the same.

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.300
Step one.

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:22.200
Take a hammer,
try squishing it just

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:23.500
to get a sense for how that goes.

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:29.052
You want the most power you
can get with perfect control.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:33.180
So here I have tons of control,
but not much power.

00:03:33.180 --> 00:03:36.142
Here, I've got loads of power
but like my aim is going to be way off.

00:03:36.142 --> 00:03:37.992
Yeah, because this is
room temperature clay,

00:03:38.182 --> 00:03:40.022
we need like no -- no power.

00:03:40.072 --> 00:03:41.900
So err on the side of control.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.452
You're seeing the divots that
your hammer is making?

00:03:44.452 --> 00:03:44.912
Yes.

00:03:44.912 --> 00:03:45.900
You want to be aware of those.

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.900
Any tilting of your hammer
like this or like this

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:51.382
or like this is going to make dents.

00:03:51.812 --> 00:03:55.000
So when I-- When I keep
the hammer relatively flat here,

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.100
I get only very very
minor denting along the edges.

00:03:58.100 --> 00:04:02.600
But if-- but if I angle my hand wrong
and then hit in the middle, I suddenly have

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.000
this big old crescent-shaped,
and I assume in metal,

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:06.900
that's kind of hard to get out.

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:08.160
Yes, very much!

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:11.100
Clay is slightly,
it's less forgiving than metal.

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:13.200
But you're going to get
the same effect with metal,

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.512
and so this is a good way to make sure--

00:04:14.512 --> 00:04:15.092
I can see them.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.400
I'm flattening down on top of it,
and like it's still visible that crease

00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:20.500
I put in there earlier.

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.100
Lift up the clay
from the anvil.

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:24.592
It's going to try to stick to the anvil,
so you're going to want to lift it

00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600
every couple of hits.

00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.400
Just to make sure it doesn't stick.

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.300
So regularly.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:28.000
Yes.

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.522
Remove it from the anvil.

00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:30.900
That does not happen
with real metal.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.400
Okay.

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.600
Now try slipping at 90 degrees,
and stretching this out.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:38.000
Yeah, you'll notice that now
that this is kind of spatula shape

00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:41.282
because you were spreading
the clay in this direction.

00:04:41.432 --> 00:04:43.092
In this direction,
this direction,

00:04:43.132 --> 00:04:45.200
not so much into the bar though.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.000
Exactly.

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.712
And so now try
getting this the same--

00:04:48.712 --> 00:04:51.700
I'm gonna rotate it,
and we're going to try

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.200
and make equal thickness to this again?

00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:53.800
Yes.
&gt;&gt; All right.

00:04:58.140 --> 00:04:59.500
And now you'll notice
it's puckering.

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.732
So flip it again 90 degrees,
and fix the pucker.

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.900
Now, I've got like
this chisel shape.

00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:05.060
Yeah.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.300
So do I want to flip it back
to the first spot side

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.100
or on to the other side?

00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:11.000
If you flip it on the other side,
you'd want to bring it to the edge

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.300
of the anvil right here,
so that you can maintain

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:15.240
that place where it changes thickness.

00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:24.380
[Music]

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:25.040
Yeah.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:27.440
All right.

00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.800
I've still got kind
of this channel going down

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.100
the middle, is that...

00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.100
Yeah, that's pretty
normal for starting.

00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.260
See if you could smooth
it out as best you can.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:37.534
With refrigerated clay
or with hot metal,

00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.680
I would have to be hitting this a lot harder.

00:05:39.700 --> 00:05:41.500
Yes, but you also
need less of this.

00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:43.900
You get a trade-off,
and that it's harder

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:45.600
to make big mistakes when it's harder.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.400
This is similar to working
at a low red heat when

00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.000
you're blacksmithing.

00:05:49.572 --> 00:05:52.300
Typically, what smiths will do is
they will forge the rough shape,

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:54.822
and then at a cooler temperature,
they will take out the dents.

00:05:55.262 --> 00:05:55.942
Interesting.

00:05:57.580 --> 00:05:59.920
I have a slightly
flatter piece of clay.

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:03.000
It took me several minutes with
a hammer and an anvil to do it.

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.600
The next thing I'd like
to show you how to do is

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.200
how to make a leaf.

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.800
So what I'm going to do is
I'm going to use this hammer

00:06:08.800 --> 00:06:09.800
for most of what I'm doing.

00:06:09.800 --> 00:06:10.300
All right.

00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.000
And the first thing I'm going to do
is what's called drawing a taper,

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.300
which means I want to make this pointy.

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.700
So I'm going to take my hammer
and angle it, and I'm

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:18.300
going to angle my clay a little bit,

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:21.402
and I'm going to whack it,
rotating 90 degrees every time.

00:06:23.882 --> 00:06:26.200
So now it's pointy,
and the next thing I'm going to do is

00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.800
I'm going to hold it
over the edge of the anvil,

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.402
and I'm going to whack right
over the transition between the Anvil

00:06:30.402 --> 00:06:31.660
and empty space,

00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:36.040
and that's going to create that shape,
that kind of step down.

00:06:36.060 --> 00:06:36.700
You see that?

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:37.300
Yes.

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.460
Now I'm going to do the same thing
on the other side.

00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:41.400
I'm going to rotate that.

00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:44.442
This is forming the transition
from the leaf and the stem.

00:06:48.692 --> 00:06:50.792
So now I've got
the stem thinner.

00:06:51.002 --> 00:06:54.300
Now, I'm going to round off the
corners by pointing the corner up

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:55.592
to make it into an octagon.

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:02.100
And now just getting it as smooth
and round as I can.

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:03.500
So now it's round.

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:05.900
But I'm going to set this
on the anvil like this.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:08.300
I'm going to make it flat,
and I could finish it there,

00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:10.500
but I'm not going to,
and so what I'm going to do

00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:11.600
is unstick it.

00:07:12.900 --> 00:07:17.700
Now, I'm going to use the cross peen end
of the hammer to rotate out the shape

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.600
of the leaf, and also
put in the definition.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.160
And there, you've got a leaf.

00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:26.100
And then the last thing you want to do,
I'm going to throw a hammer out here to

00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.900
simulate having an actual step down here.

00:07:28.360 --> 00:07:30.460
I'm going to hold it
over this spot right here.

00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:34.500
I'm going to tap it to give
it a little bit of character,

00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:39.660
and then, I'm going to tap down the tip
to make it look a little more organic.

00:07:40.572 --> 00:07:41.112
And there's the leaf.

00:07:41.192 --> 00:07:41.692
Brilliant.

00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.592
All right.

00:07:46.332 --> 00:07:48.600
How long do you have to practice
before your forearm

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:51.840
starts having strength,
and not getting really sore very quickly?

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.372
It depends on how much
rock climbing you do.

00:07:53.372 --> 00:07:55.260
Hmm, not enough apparently.

00:07:55.260 --> 00:08:20.322
[Music]

00:08:20.382 --> 00:08:21.152
I leafed.

00:08:21.272 --> 00:08:21.792
You leafed.

00:08:24.572 --> 00:08:26.400
Frozen clay compared
to regular clay.

00:08:26.400 --> 00:08:28.600
My forearm is already sore
from holding a hammer.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:30.132
So this is going
to get interesting.

00:08:31.052 --> 00:08:31.700
So same process?

00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:32.700
Same process.

00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:34.712
Oh my gosh, that's harder.

00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.720
[Music]

00:08:39.720 --> 00:08:41.020
That's a great point.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:41.720
Thank you.

00:08:43.180 --> 00:08:44.480
Do a step down.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:47.100
There we go.

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:50.422
So I've got a bowl of ice
and water and salt.

00:08:50.622 --> 00:08:52.500
Make this our sort
of reverse forge.

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:54.612
Let the clay sit in there
for a few seconds.

00:08:54.702 --> 00:08:56.400
If you're doing something
with this out of metal,

00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.182
how long would you be throwing back
in the forge for--

00:08:58.182 --> 00:08:59.600
It depends on how thick it is.

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:04.400
So the super thin areas like this spot
are going to change temperature faster,

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.692
so they don't have to go in
the forge for very long.

00:09:07.562 --> 00:09:09.500
If you're doing something
really thick, you can wait

00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:10.600
until you're an old man.

00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:11.940
Like just forever.

00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:17.400
Is that enough
or should I go thin?

00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:17.900
That's perfect.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.600
That's perfect.

00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:20.000
So now you have some room
to work with?

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:41.780
[Music]

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:42.900
Now, we move onto metal.

00:09:43.182 --> 00:09:43.852
Yes.

00:09:44.282 --> 00:09:45.012
Metal.

00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:46.900
It was the...

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:52.400
Like what are we looking for?

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:54.002
How do we know when it's ready?

00:09:54.002 --> 00:09:57.500
The nice thing about iron is
that it changes colors to tell you what,

00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:58.400
how hot it is.

00:09:58.622 --> 00:10:02.900
So the scale of blacksmithing color starts
at what they call a cherry red,

00:10:02.900 --> 00:10:03.700
or a low red,

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.792
and then you work your way up
through reddish orange to orange,

00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.352
to reddish yellow to yellow to...

00:10:09.672 --> 00:10:11.600
At that point, the metal
actually catches on fire.

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:13.992
And so what color are we
looking for an orange?

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:17.080
This is a mild steel bar that
we've got right here.

00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.100
And so this is workable all
the way down to a really low red.

00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.160
And so anything where
it's glowing, we can hit it.

00:10:24.062 --> 00:10:24.900
So about here.

00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:27.800
This is this is how far I can grab this
before it starts getting

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.032
uncomfortably warm.

00:10:29.462 --> 00:10:30.500
It is warm.

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:31.512
I mean, this part's warm.

00:10:31.792 --> 00:10:34.100
Back here, like there's
quite a heat difference

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:35.820
between right there and right there.

00:10:35.820 --> 00:10:39.900
So I feel pretty safe holding right here,
and you do notice I have bare hands,

00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.500
that helps me feel how
the steel is doing what--

00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.400
Once I feel it cooling off
too much under my hand,

00:10:46.400 --> 00:10:48.600
then I'll know it might be
time to throw it back in.

00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.500
All right, let's see
about flattening this a little bit.

00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:58.580
[Music]

00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:00.300
Got some fun flaking here.

00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:01.360
Yeah.

00:11:01.360 --> 00:11:02.700
This is a magnetite.

00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.600
What's happened is some
of the metal has returned

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:07.872
to its ore state.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.642
This is the black sand that the Japanese
smiths used to make their swords,

00:11:11.722 --> 00:11:13.402
except they find it naturally occurring.

00:11:13.402 --> 00:11:46.780
[Music]

00:11:46.780 --> 00:11:47.800
What do you think Joseph?

00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:50.200
The finest leaf that
blacksmithing has ever seen?

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:55.400
Probably the best one ever
that no one has ever made a better Leaf.

00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:57.500
I like the definition that
you manage to put in here.

00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:59.700
That's actually, considering
how tired you were from all

00:11:59.700 --> 00:12:03.200
the stuff we've been doing before,
that's not bad for hammer control,

00:12:03.840 --> 00:12:06.420
and then you managed to get all
the individual steps right

00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:07.100
all the way up to here.

00:12:07.182 --> 00:12:08.392
So that's awesome.

00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:11.100
And there's very very
little carps from map here.

00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:14.900
So good taper, good set down,
good texturing.

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:15.900
Well done.

00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.200
Intro to blacksmithing is
actually pretty simple.

00:12:18.200 --> 00:12:22.300
We've shown you a couple of different ways
of how to make forges that you could use

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:23.012
for this technique.

00:12:23.372 --> 00:12:25.512
Our classic stand up
in a bucket forge,

00:12:25.572 --> 00:12:29.000
and then our smaller paint can forge,
those are both things that would work

00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:29.900
for this process.

00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:33.000
You just have to have a little bit
of patience, plenty of fuel,

00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.200
and a few tools.

00:12:34.200 --> 00:12:35.802
Some hammers
and an anvil are...

00:12:35.802 --> 00:12:37.600
No matter which forge
you decide to try with,

00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:39.900
exercise lots and lots of caution.

00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:42.500
Rule number one of blacksmithing,
even if the metal looks black,

00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:44.200
it is still hot enough to melt your flesh.

00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:46.182
So like assume
everything's hot.

00:12:46.182 --> 00:12:47.400
I assume everything
is trying to kill you.

00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.880
Be careful with the fire
and don't die.

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:52.280
Thank you to Joseph
for teaching me the beginning steps

00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:55.040
of blacksmithing using
the freezing cold clay.

00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:58.900
That works great as an analog,
and then moving up to steel.

00:12:59.040 --> 00:13:01.580
This steel is probably
barely a step above iron,

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:02.600
but I made it.

00:13:03.140 --> 00:13:04.220
Guys, thanks for watching.

00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.500
We've always got more
for you to see.

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:07.300
That box up at the top
will transport you directly

00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.200
to our last video.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:08.900
You should check that out.

00:13:08.900 --> 00:13:11.660
The other box at the bottom
will show you what YouTube thinks

00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:12.560
you should be watching next,

00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.700
and if you aren't a subscriber yet,
just hit this bomb to get in the club,

00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:16.600
and that way you never
miss out on the fun.

00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.960
