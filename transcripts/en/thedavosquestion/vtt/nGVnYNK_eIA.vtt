Matthias: Hello I'm Matthias LÃ¼fkens from
the World Economic forums media team and responsible

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.900
for social media activities.
I'm here at the Davos debate corner with Reem

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:15.280
Kassis who brought you all the presidents
and prime ministers and royals to this edition

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.680
of the Davos debate.
The annual meeting of the World Economic forum

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:24.260
is finished, and we would like to thank the
entire YouTube team who helped us set up this

00:00:24.260 --> 00:00:31.180
amazing experiment. I'll start off their names.
Thanks to Steve, thanks to Jeff, Lee, Olivia,

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.340
Reem: Tom

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:38.309
Matthias: Tom, Rashna, and Robert and I'm
sure I'm forgetting a couple.

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:43.680
A big thank you to Julia [Inaudible] who won
the Davos debates this year.

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:50.649
She brought her cause, the fight against female
genital mutilation to Davos.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:55.030
Her panel that was here yesterday is up on
this channel, you must watch it.

00:00:55.030 --> 00:01:00.480
It is amazing how she starts her cause and
reignites her cause.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:05.770
Absolutely brilliant, you should watch them.
The Davos debates are not finished, they will

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:10.439
continue in all our regional events.
This year we will be in Vietnam, in Morocco,

00:01:10.439 --> 00:01:14.469
we will be in Tanzania Africa. We will be
in India and in China.

00:01:14.469 --> 00:01:19.039
So hoping to continue this discussion with
you, thank you very much for all your questions

00:01:19.039 --> 00:01:21.229
and videos and signing off from Davos.
