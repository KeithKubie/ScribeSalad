00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:02.560
So we have a parallelogram
right over here.

00:00:02.560 --> 00:00:04.880
And what I want to prove
is that its diagonals

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.717
bisect each other.

00:00:06.717 --> 00:00:08.800
So the first thing that
we can think about-- these

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:10.050
aren't just diagonals.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:12.430
These are lines that are
intersecting, parallel lines.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.660
So you can also view
them as transversals.

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:17.280
And if we focus on
DB right over here,

00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:21.090
we see that it
intersects DC and AB.

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.825
And since we know that
they're parallel--

00:00:24.825 --> 00:00:26.200
this is a
parallelogram-- we know

00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:29.060
the alternate interior
angles must be congruent.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.140
So that angle must be
equal to that angle there.

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.650
And let me make a label here.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:34.450
Let me call that
middle point E. So we

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:45.680
know that angle ABE must
be congruent to angle CDE

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:51.320
by alternate interior angles
of a transversal intersecting

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.200
parallel lines.

00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:59.430
Now, if we look at
diagonal AC-- or we

00:00:59.430 --> 00:01:02.960
should call it transversal AC--
we can make the same argument.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.769
It intersects here and here.

00:01:04.769 --> 00:01:06.510
These two lines are parallel.

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.320
So alternate interior
angles must be congruent.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:13.290
So angle DEC must be-- so let
me write this down-- angle

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:27.284
DEC must be congruent to angle
BAE, for the exact same reason.

00:01:27.284 --> 00:01:28.700
Now we have something
interesting,

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:30.408
if we look at this
top triangle over here

00:01:30.408 --> 00:01:31.880
and this bottom triangle.

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:36.260
We have one set of corresponding
angles that are congruent.

00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:39.217
We have a side in between
that's going to be congruent.

00:01:39.217 --> 00:01:41.050
Actually, let me write
that down explicitly.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.740
We know-- and we proved
this to ourselves

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:48.560
in the previous video-- that
parallelograms-- not only are

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.530
opposite sides parallel,
they are also congruent.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:53.040
So we know from
the previous video

00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:55.340
that that side is
equal to that side.

00:01:55.340 --> 00:01:57.150
So let me go back to
what I was saying.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:01:58.875
We have two sets of
corresponding angles

00:01:58.875 --> 00:02:01.834
that are congruent, we
have a side in between

00:02:01.834 --> 00:02:03.750
that's congruent, and
then we have another set

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.692
of corresponding angles
that are congruent.

00:02:05.692 --> 00:02:08.150
So we know that this triangle
is congruent to that triangle

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:08.983
by angle-side-angle.

00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:14.670
So we know that
triangle-- I'm going

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.500
to go from the blue to the
orange to the last one--

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.150
triangle ABE is congruent to
triangle-- blue, orange, then

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:29.480
the last one-- CDE, by
angle-side-angle congruency.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:35.930
Now, what does that do for us?

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:38.270
Well, we know if two
triangles are congruent,

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.897
all of their
corresponding features,

00:02:39.897 --> 00:02:41.730
especially all of their
corresponding sides,

00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:42.850
are congruent.

00:02:42.850 --> 00:02:49.970
So we know that side EC
corresponds to side EA.

00:02:49.970 --> 00:03:00.806
Or I could say side AE
corresponds to side CE.

00:03:00.806 --> 00:03:02.930
They're corresponding sides
of congruent triangles,

00:03:02.930 --> 00:03:05.380
so their measures or their
lengths must be the same.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.207
So AE must be equal to CE.

00:03:09.207 --> 00:03:10.790
Let me put two slashes
since I already

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:12.630
used one slash over here.

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:15.300
Now, by the same
exact logic, we know

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.060
that DE-- let me
focus on this-- we

00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:26.100
know that BE must
be equal to DE.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.910
Once again, they're
corresponding sides

00:03:27.910 --> 00:03:31.280
of two congruent triangles, so
they must have the same length.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:38.440
So this is corresponding
sides of congruent triangles.

00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:42.745
So BE is equal to DE.

00:03:42.745 --> 00:03:44.150
And we've done our proof.

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.220
We've shown that, look,
diagonal DB is splitting AC

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.420
into two segments of equal
length and vice versa.

00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:55.550
AC is splitting DB into two
segments of equal length.

00:03:55.550 --> 00:03:58.224
So they are
bisecting each other.

00:03:58.224 --> 00:03:59.640
Now let's go the
other way around.

00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.930
Let's prove to
ourselves that if we

00:04:02.930 --> 00:04:04.870
have two diagonals of
a quadrilateral that

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.900
are bisecting each
other, that we

00:04:06.900 --> 00:04:09.180
are dealing with
a parallelogram.

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:09.890
So let me see.

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:12.630
So we're going to assume that
the two diagonals are bisecting

00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:13.140
each other.

00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.130
So we're assuming that
that is equal to that

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.519
and that that right over
there is equal to that.

00:04:17.519 --> 00:04:22.690
Given that, we want to prove
that this is a parallelogram.

00:04:22.690 --> 00:04:28.190
And to do that, we just
have to remind ourselves

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.566
that this angle is going to
be equal to that angle-- it's

00:04:30.566 --> 00:04:32.773
one of the first things we
learned-- because they are

00:04:32.773 --> 00:04:33.720
vertical angles.

00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:35.630
So let me write this down.

00:04:35.630 --> 00:04:38.540
Let me label this point.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:43.730
Angle CED is going
to be equal to--

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:47.385
or is congruent to-- angle BEA.

00:04:53.620 --> 00:04:55.454
Well, that shows us
that these two triangles

00:04:55.454 --> 00:04:57.869
are congruent because we have
our corresponding sides that

00:04:57.869 --> 00:05:00.560
are congruent, an angle in
between, and then another side.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.730
So we now know that
triangle-- I'll

00:05:02.730 --> 00:05:07.910
keep this in
yellow-- triangle AEB

00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:22.590
is congruent to triangle DEC
by side-angle-side congruency,

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:28.320
by SAS congruent triangles.

00:05:28.320 --> 00:05:29.019
Fair enough.

00:05:29.019 --> 00:05:31.060
Now, if we know that two
triangles are congruent,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.310
we know that all of the
corresponding sides and angles

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:34.470
are congruent.

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:42.910
So for example, we
know that angle CDE

00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:47.240
is going to be
congruent to angle BAE.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:06:06.140
And this is just corresponding
angles of congruent triangles.

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.310
And now we have this
transversal of these two lines

00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:16.030
that could be parallel, if the
alternate interior angles are

00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:16.640
congruent.

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.150
And we see that they are.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:22.440
These two are kind of candidate
alternate interior angles,

00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:24.070
and they are congruent.

00:06:24.070 --> 00:06:28.072
So AB must be parallel to CD.

00:06:28.072 --> 00:06:29.530
Actually, I'll just
draw one arrow.

00:06:33.080 --> 00:06:39.570
AB is parallel to CD by
alternate interior angles

00:06:39.570 --> 00:06:42.932
congruent of parallel lines.

00:06:42.932 --> 00:06:44.390
I'm just writing
in some shorthand.

00:06:44.390 --> 00:06:46.360
Forgive the cryptic
nature of it.

00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:47.910
I'm saying it out.

00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:49.825
And so we can then
do the exact same--

00:06:49.825 --> 00:06:51.950
we've just shown that these
two sides are parallel.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:53.491
We could then do
the exact same logic

00:06:53.491 --> 00:06:55.262
to show that these two
sides are parallel.

00:06:55.262 --> 00:06:56.970
And I won't necessarily
write it all out,

00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:00.220
but it's the exact same
proof to show that these two.

00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:01.920
So first of all, we
know that this angle

00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:05.300
is congruent to that
angle right over there.

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:06.550
Actually, let me write it out.

00:07:06.550 --> 00:07:16.990
So we know that angle AEC
is congruent to angle DEB.

00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:24.020
They are vertical angles.

00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:28.710
And that was our reason
up here, as well.

00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:34.530
And then we see the
triangle AEC must

00:07:34.530 --> 00:07:38.630
be congruent to triangle
DEB by side-angle-side.

00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:43.330
So then we have
triangle AEC must

00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:50.950
be congruent to triangle
DEB by SAS congruency.

00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:55.520
Then we know that corresponding
angles must be congruent.

00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:03.680
So for example, angle CAE must
be congruent to angle BDE.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.840
And this is they're
corresponding angles

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.560
of congruent triangles.

00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:21.940
So CAE-- let me do
this in a new color--

00:08:21.940 --> 00:08:23.435
must be congruent to BDE.

00:08:28.290 --> 00:08:30.080
And now we have a transversal.

00:08:30.080 --> 00:08:32.280
The alternate interior
angles are congruent.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.659
So the two lines that the
transversal is intersecting

00:08:34.659 --> 00:08:36.360
must be parallel.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.130
So this must be
parallel to that.

00:08:39.130 --> 00:08:43.750
So then we have AC
must be parallel to be

00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:47.445
BD by alternate interior angles.

00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:51.290
And we're done.

00:08:51.290 --> 00:08:53.530
We've just proven that
if the diagonals bisect

00:08:53.530 --> 00:08:57.150
each other, if we start that as
a given, then we end at a point

00:08:57.150 --> 00:08:59.650
where we say, hey, the opposite
sides of this quadrilateral

00:08:59.650 --> 00:09:05.030
must be parallel, or that
ABCD is a parallelogram.
