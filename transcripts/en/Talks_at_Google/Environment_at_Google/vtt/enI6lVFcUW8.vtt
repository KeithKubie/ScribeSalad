[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.556 --> 00:00:09.870
SPEAKER: Welcome to another one
of our San Diego Google Talks.

00:00:09.870 --> 00:00:12.910
We're really lucky to have Rick
Schwartz with us here today.

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:16.470
He is the global ambassador
for the San Diego Zoo.

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:19.500
He is here to talk to us
about the entire journey

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.810
that the Diego Zoo has had.

00:00:20.810 --> 00:00:21.010
Almost--

00:00:21.010 --> 00:00:21.870
RICK SCHWARTZ: Not
the entire journey.

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.036
That's a pretty big journey,

00:00:23.036 --> 00:00:25.270
SPEAKER: I mean it's over
a century, so it's a lot.

00:00:25.270 --> 00:00:27.900
And he'll talk to us little bit
about what their focus is today

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.940
and how far they've come along.

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:31.440
He has a couple of
videos to share.

00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:33.856
And for those of you in the
audience who've already heard,

00:00:33.856 --> 00:00:36.690
he also brought some furry
animals or non-furry animals--

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:39.072
RICK SCHWARTZ: Some
non-furry ones, too.

00:00:39.072 --> 00:00:42.367
SPEAKER: --to come join us
with their zookeepers is

00:00:42.367 --> 00:00:43.450
what you would call those?

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:43.720
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.969
I've got keepers with us here.

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.320
SPEAKER: Their caretakers.

00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.640
So we'll save questions
towards the end.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:50.640
We have a couple of ones
we want to get through,

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:51.960
and Rick already has
a lot of content he

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.168
wants to share with you guys.

00:00:53.168 --> 00:00:54.952
So we'll go ahead
and get started.

00:00:54.952 --> 00:00:55.535
Well, welcome.

00:00:55.535 --> 00:00:56.370
RICK SCHWARTZ: Well, thank you.

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:56.870
Thank you.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.800
And hello, everyone in
the audience and hello

00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:00.700
everyone that are
watching online as well.

00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:01.830
It's sounds pretty
awesome to be here.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:03.660
We've actually, for
the last two years,

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:06.030
had some opportunities to
talk to the Google campus up

00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.249
in the Bay Area, as
well, do live programs up

00:01:08.249 --> 00:01:09.540
there for their special events.

00:01:09.540 --> 00:01:11.290
So it's kind of fun
to be here in our home

00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:12.167
office in San Diego.

00:01:12.167 --> 00:01:12.750
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:13.920
And we're fairly new.

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:17.700
So we're really taking that
theme of celebrating local San

00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:21.366
Diego, and, of course, the
zoo is a big part of that.

00:01:21.366 --> 00:01:22.740
So take us back
to the beginning.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:24.882
1916, it all gets started.

00:01:24.882 --> 00:01:26.715
You guys just had your
100-year anniversary.

00:01:26.715 --> 00:01:27.710
RICK SCHWARTZ: We did.

00:01:27.710 --> 00:01:28.210
We did.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:29.130
SPEAKER: How did it all begin?

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:30.270
RICK SCHWARTZ: Well,
Let's see if I've

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.451
got the right button here.

00:01:31.451 --> 00:01:31.950
Nope.

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:32.910
That says no.

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.568
Which button should
I push to make it go?

00:01:35.568 --> 00:01:36.550
Oh, there's-- That one.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:37.050
All right.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.160
I let you do that then.

00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:38.660
All right.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:40.200
So on this slide
right here is kind

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:44.980
of a perfect view of Balboa
Park about 100 years ago.

00:01:44.980 --> 00:01:46.890
And so the San Diego
Zoo started because

00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.579
of the California-Panama
Exposition that occurred.

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.120
And if you're not
familiar with that,

00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:53.994
essentially, long story short,
the Panama Canal opened up.

00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.410
And about a year
before it opened,

00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:57.750
San Diego was
roughly about 39,000,

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:00.750
40,000 people in population.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:03.750
And all the ships would always
go past them to LA and up

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.471
to San Francisco as well.

00:02:05.471 --> 00:02:06.970
So this was an
opportunity they want

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:10.121
to showcase on a global level,
or at least semi-global,

00:02:10.121 --> 00:02:12.120
that they are a good stop,
as well, whether it's

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:13.800
for merchant or for visits.

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.600
And Balboa Park,
at the time, was

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:19.380
sort of this large swath of land
between San Diego proper, which

00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:21.060
we call downtown San
Diego now, and some

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:24.540
of the smaller suburbs of North
Park and University Heights.

00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:27.210
So with that, the idea
was to have this big event

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.940
to celebrate San Diego.

00:02:29.940 --> 00:02:32.917
As that wrapped up,
then, and as vendors

00:02:32.917 --> 00:02:35.250
pulled out-- some of them
didn't do so well financially.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:37.020
They just cut their
losses and left--

00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:39.264
a lot of things were
left in Balboa Park that

00:02:39.264 --> 00:02:40.680
weren't expected
to be left there,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:42.910
and that included some animals.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:46.350
Imagine Balboa Park, looking
somewhat like that slide,

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:49.080
with some elk running
through it, some bears,

00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.207
some coyotes, and
yes, even some lions.

00:02:52.207 --> 00:02:53.790
And that's where we
get the whole idea

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:55.560
that it started with a roar.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:59.280
Now, the majority of the
enclosures for the expo

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.280
were along, what we
call, Park Boulevard now.

00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:04.530
And it was these long
rows of enclosures

00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:06.270
where people could see animals.

00:03:06.270 --> 00:03:09.810
And the whole thing really
started for the San Diego Zoo

00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:12.145
when this gentleman here,
Dr. Harry Wegeforth, who

00:03:12.145 --> 00:03:14.100
was a local surgeon,
he and his brother

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.980
were returning from doing
surgery at the local hospital,

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:18.427
and they heard
some lions roaring.

00:03:18.427 --> 00:03:20.760
Now, what I know about lions
is they roar in the morning

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:21.926
hours and the evening hours.

00:03:21.926 --> 00:03:23.520
So and since he just
finished surgery,

00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.230
I assume it's the evening time.

00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:27.809
And that's where the term "it
began with a roar" comes from.

00:03:27.809 --> 00:03:30.100
Dr. Harry heard that roar,
turned to his brother, said,

00:03:30.100 --> 00:03:31.683
you know, I've always
thought it would

00:03:31.683 --> 00:03:33.900
be fun to have a zoo
here in San Diego.

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:34.969
I think I'll do it.

00:03:34.969 --> 00:03:36.510
And his brother knew
him well enough,

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:37.759
because they grew up together.

00:03:37.759 --> 00:03:40.230
Dr. Harry had a history of
always being out in the dirt

00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.930
and looking for animals and
growing up near the woods

00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:46.470
where he grew up, that his
brother wasn't too surprised.

00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:48.660
That was September of 1916.

00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:51.510
So now, October 2,
1916, it officially

00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:54.295
became the Zoological
Society of San Diego.

00:03:54.295 --> 00:03:55.920
Dr. Harry brought
his friends together.

00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:57.600
They pitched to the
city to start the zoo.

00:03:57.600 --> 00:03:59.580
And the city was, like,
nope, we don't want that.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.080
So they came up with
the Zoological Society

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.300
of San Diego, which is a
nonprofit organization,

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.750
to run a zoo for the kids.

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.500
He reached out to the
schools in the area,

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.208
as well, along with
other philanthropists

00:04:09.208 --> 00:04:10.600
to kind of get things going.

00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:12.308
They gathered up some
of the animals that

00:04:12.308 --> 00:04:14.820
were left in the zoo and
started their whole thing.

00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:17.459
And from there,
it's always kind of

00:04:17.459 --> 00:04:21.180
been this groundbreaking
zoological organization.

00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:23.580
I've been with the organization
for about 17 years now,

00:04:23.580 --> 00:04:26.500
and I can't believe all the
changes I've seen in my time.

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.440
I can't imagine how
forward-thinking Dr.

00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:29.320
Harry must have been.

00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.590
So the slide you
see here, right now,

00:04:31.590 --> 00:04:35.400
you have some billy goats on
this old concrete platform.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:37.520
It doesn't seem like much
to today's standards.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.410
But keep in mind, this was
1930s when this photo was taken.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.180
It used to be in
that time, animals

00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:45.270
were in what we
originally saw right here.

00:04:45.270 --> 00:04:47.970
This is what an animal enclosure
looks like at a zoo in America

00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:49.170
at that time.

00:04:49.170 --> 00:04:52.959
Dr. Harry wanted to try and
show the animals what they could

00:04:52.959 --> 00:04:55.500
do-- or show people, I should
say, what the animals could do,

00:04:55.500 --> 00:04:58.195
offering up exhibit spaces that
allowed mountain goats to climb

00:04:58.195 --> 00:04:59.820
something that's
somewhat of a mountain

00:04:59.820 --> 00:05:01.060
structure for the time.

00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.930
And so the concept was always
forward-thinking for San Diego

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:05.266
Zoo even in its infancy.

00:05:05.266 --> 00:05:07.640
And that really brings us up
to date to where we are now.

00:05:07.640 --> 00:05:09.080
And what I'd like to do.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.330
We'll stop here at the
very best care slide

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:13.496
and bring out one of our
animal friends for you guys

00:05:13.496 --> 00:05:16.220
because I know you weren't just
here to see slides all day.

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:20.150
And this kind of ties
into what we talked about,

00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:22.970
that forward-thinking concept.

00:05:22.970 --> 00:05:27.640
We have a 21-year-old crested
porcupine coming out right now.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.496
This is Pokey.

00:05:29.496 --> 00:05:30.620
Appropriately named, right?

00:05:30.620 --> 00:05:31.265
SPEAKER: [CHUCKLES] Pokey.

00:05:31.265 --> 00:05:33.140
RICK SCHWARTZ: And she
is actually trained.

00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:35.389
Now, how many of you knew
you could train a porcupine,

00:05:35.389 --> 00:05:37.130
much less put one
on a leash, right?

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:39.860
The idea of what we do
for training purposes

00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.600
and for care purposes,
we always try

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.850
to think what's best
for the animal, what's

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:47.030
best for their longevity, and
21 years old for a porcupine

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:48.890
is pretty darn old.

00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:52.070
This particular species is
found in Africa and in India,

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:54.950
and so there's the African
and Indian crested porcupines.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.960
They are a bit different
than our North American

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:58.490
species, of course.

00:05:58.490 --> 00:06:01.016
But to give you some quick
fun facts, they are a rodent,

00:06:01.016 --> 00:06:03.140
so that means their front
teeth are always growing,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:04.940
the incisors are always growing.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.136
And they can bring food to their
mouth with their front feet.

00:06:08.136 --> 00:06:10.010
And if you want to walk
Pokey along, you can.

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:11.030
Let everyone see up close.

00:06:11.030 --> 00:06:11.480
SPEAKER: How old is Pokey?

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:13.580
RICK SCHWARTZ: Pokey
is 21 years old.

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.396
So that's pretty
old for a porcupine.

00:06:15.396 --> 00:06:17.270
If she sneezes, just
kind of block your face,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.769
so the quills don't
go in your face.

00:06:18.769 --> 00:06:19.800
I'm kidding.

00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.050
I'm kidding.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:21.750
That's a myth.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:23.375
They can't actually
shoot their quills.

00:06:23.375 --> 00:06:24.950
Quills are a modified hair.

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:27.519
They grow out of a root
follicle just like your hair.

00:06:27.519 --> 00:06:29.060
And they're made of
the same proteins

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:29.960
as hair and fingernails.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:31.370
That's what makes them
so firm and stiff.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:33.650
So think of your fingernail
being kind of rolled up

00:06:33.650 --> 00:06:34.960
into a straw.

00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:37.760
And I say straw because they
are somewhat hollow inside.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.770
In our North American
species, the quills

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:42.669
are smaller, more like
large toothpicks, where

00:06:42.669 --> 00:06:44.210
in this species, of
course, much more

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.084
like a large stick or a pen.

00:06:46.084 --> 00:06:47.500
Now, the longer
ones you see there

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:51.140
that act more like a skirt,
those are the more cover ones.

00:06:51.140 --> 00:06:52.970
They would flare those
up and really show

00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:56.387
the big sharp ones underneath
when they felt under attack.

00:06:56.387 --> 00:06:58.720
You might also get a chance
to see the ones in the tail.

00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.770
Looked like someone
trimmed them with scissors.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:02.960
They grow naturally that way
because they're hollow inside.

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:04.970
That's one way they can
warn other large animals

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:08.640
like elephants or any other
large hoofed animal or even

00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.140
predators.

00:07:09.140 --> 00:07:10.473
They shake that tail real quick.

00:07:10.473 --> 00:07:12.800
It makes a rattling, a very
staccato rattling noise.

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.780
It's the universal alarm
in the animal kingdom

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:15.680
to say, look out.

00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.540
Don't step on me.

00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:19.540
So what they could do
with their quills, though.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.748
If you get cold, sometimes
you get goosebumps, right,

00:07:21.748 --> 00:07:23.060
or something startles you?

00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:25.550
That's an involuntary
action of muscles you have

00:07:25.550 --> 00:07:28.200
that are attached to your
root follicles of your hair.

00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:30.110
Porcupines, and
many other species,

00:07:30.110 --> 00:07:32.822
have a voluntary muscle
control of those.

00:07:32.822 --> 00:07:35.030
So if she were to be under
attack from her left side,

00:07:35.030 --> 00:07:37.239
she could flare all her
quills off to that left side.

00:07:37.239 --> 00:07:39.654
If you felt she was under
attack on her right side or even

00:07:39.654 --> 00:07:41.660
from the front, she
could bow her head down

00:07:41.660 --> 00:07:43.160
and bring those quills forward.

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:46.622
I have seen video footage
of two lionesses trying

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:48.830
to get one of these, and it
didn't work out very well

00:07:48.830 --> 00:07:49.670
for the lionesses.

00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:53.810
So it's a very effective form
of defense for the porcupine.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.019
SPEAKER: So what is Pokey
eating, or what's his food?

00:07:56.019 --> 00:07:58.310
RICK SCHWARTZ: Pokey gets a
mixture of different fruits

00:07:58.310 --> 00:07:59.180
and vegetation.

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:00.910
Sweet potatoes on
the list right now.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:02.660
And also usually get
a little bit of corn.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.710
And we have what's called
[INAUDIBLE] biscuits.

00:08:04.710 --> 00:08:07.730
So similar to what you would
have as a fortified dry food

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:09.230
for your dog or cat at home.

00:08:09.230 --> 00:08:10.850
We do have those
that have formulated

00:08:10.850 --> 00:08:14.082
in zoological settings
for zoo animals, as well,

00:08:14.082 --> 00:08:15.540
and allows us to
make sure they get

00:08:15.540 --> 00:08:18.020
sort of a baseline fortified
diet and the extra fruits

00:08:18.020 --> 00:08:20.227
and vegetables and offer
up more nutrition for them.

00:08:20.227 --> 00:08:20.810
SPEAKER: Nice.

00:08:20.810 --> 00:08:22.700
So what's their ideal habitat.

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:24.456
Like, where do I find
all the porcupines.

00:08:24.456 --> 00:08:26.330
RICK SCHWARTZ: Well,
this particular species,

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.370
their ideal habitats
more savanna,

00:08:28.370 --> 00:08:30.455
dry forest areas, what
we call a scrub area.

00:08:30.455 --> 00:08:32.830
Kind of similar what we might
actually have in this area,

00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:34.669
but just over in Africa
and Asia, of course.

00:08:34.669 --> 00:08:37.370
They would burrow and have
burrows they would be down in.

00:08:37.370 --> 00:08:40.010
This species does not climb
like our North American

00:08:40.010 --> 00:08:41.147
species does.

00:08:41.147 --> 00:08:42.980
You might see the
behaviors we're asking for

00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.270
and the reward comes.

00:08:44.270 --> 00:08:45.770
You hear that clicking sound.

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:47.810
We use clickers when
training our animals.

00:08:47.810 --> 00:08:50.232
For those of you who have
kids or were ever a kid,

00:08:50.232 --> 00:08:52.190
you know that between
two parents and one child

00:08:52.190 --> 00:08:54.380
there can be some
miscommunication sometimes

00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:56.088
because someone says
something different.

00:08:56.088 --> 00:08:58.640
Now, imagine one child
with seven parents.

00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:00.729
A lot of our animals have
upwards of five, six,

00:09:00.729 --> 00:09:03.270
or seven trainers depending upon
the schedule and the animal.

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:04.850
The clicker allows it
to stay consistent.

00:09:04.850 --> 00:09:06.650
No matter who's working with
that animal, when they've

00:09:06.650 --> 00:09:08.930
done the right behavior, we
offer that clicking sound,

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.555
tells them you've
done the right thing,

00:09:10.555 --> 00:09:11.805
and food reward is on the way.

00:09:11.805 --> 00:09:13.513
They aren't born
knowing that, of course.

00:09:13.513 --> 00:09:14.270
We retrain that.

00:09:14.270 --> 00:09:15.380
We teach them that.

00:09:15.380 --> 00:09:16.934
And the consistency
is the key thing

00:09:16.934 --> 00:09:18.100
there with all the training.

00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:19.560
You can she's holding
there with her front feet.

00:09:19.560 --> 00:09:20.300
SPEAKER: Aww, she is so cute.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.806
RICK SCHWARTZ: Very cute, huh?

00:09:21.806 --> 00:09:23.180
Well, we'll say
goodbye to Pokey.

00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:25.010
We don't stay too much time on
each animal because have a lot

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:26.300
to get through today.

00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:27.830
But going up to
the slide here, you

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.300
see a gentleman
who looks like he's

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:30.800
brushing the teeth of a camel.

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.720
Now, I guarantee you he's not.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:36.540
I know this because the
upper set of teeth on camels

00:09:36.540 --> 00:09:37.620
does not exist.

00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:40.190
They only have teeth on
the bottom side, up front.

00:09:40.190 --> 00:09:42.230
They have upper and
lower teeth in the back.

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:43.940
But what he's doing,
undoubtedly, there,

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:45.470
is probably offering
some or administering

00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:46.910
some sort of
medication to something

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:48.620
that might be going on
underneath that upper lip

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.490
of that camel.

00:09:49.490 --> 00:09:51.720
But he's the key player in
the next few slides here.

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:53.150
This is Dr. Schroeder.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:55.760
He was a young veterinarian who
started off at the San Diego

00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.718
Zoo and worked his way
up to being the director

00:09:57.718 --> 00:09:59.060
of our veterinary services.

00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:02.150
And really kind of pushed
forward our medical care

00:10:02.150 --> 00:10:03.020
for our species.

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:06.120
[INAUDIBLE] pushed forward
for a medical of our species

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:09.090
throughout the Zoological
Society of San Diego.

00:10:09.090 --> 00:10:11.490
This here, this
old, old building

00:10:11.490 --> 00:10:15.750
is the very first zoo hospital
ever, that we know of anyhow.

00:10:15.750 --> 00:10:17.760
In that time of
the 1920s and 30s,

00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.280
if zoos needed
veterinary assistance,

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.730
they would ask for a local
farm vet or a horse vet

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:25.890
or someone else with
somewhat similar experience

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:27.780
to come take care
of those animals.

00:10:27.780 --> 00:10:30.600
We built our own veterinary
hospital, hired our own vets,

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:33.090
and allowed us to really
start the very first practices

00:10:33.090 --> 00:10:35.250
of better understanding
the care for exotic animals

00:10:35.250 --> 00:10:36.344
on a medical level.

00:10:36.344 --> 00:10:38.010
This building, by the
way, still exists.

00:10:38.010 --> 00:10:41.040
If you go down to Balboa
Park, behind Old Globe, if you

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.350
kind of walk in that area,
you can see this building

00:10:43.350 --> 00:10:45.330
as currently the offices
for our curators.

00:10:45.330 --> 00:10:46.140
So kind of cool--

00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:47.200
SPEAKER: Do you still
have [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.170
RICK SCHWARTZ: Oh, yeah.

00:10:48.170 --> 00:10:48.510
I was about to say.

00:10:48.510 --> 00:10:50.550
So we do have a brand
new hospital at the zoo.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:52.787
Or not quite brand
new, but newer.

00:10:52.787 --> 00:10:54.870
I always like to tell
people that this is actually

00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:58.810
a picture of one of our regular
hospitals, human hospitals.

00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:00.510
It's not, but it
sure looks like it.

00:11:00.510 --> 00:11:02.676
It does give you an idea,
though, the level of care.

00:11:02.676 --> 00:11:07.620
This is an inside photo of
our animal care vet hospital

00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.510
at the Safari Park.

00:11:08.510 --> 00:11:09.510
Really state of the art.

00:11:09.510 --> 00:11:12.235
And we have a gorilla there
being worked on right now.

00:11:12.235 --> 00:11:13.860
Shy of the gorilla
being on the gurney,

00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.757
it looks like it
could be any hospital.

00:11:15.757 --> 00:11:18.090
And that's the level of care
we offer for these animals.

00:11:18.090 --> 00:11:20.490
These hospitals are set up
to take care of something

00:11:20.490 --> 00:11:21.780
as small as a hummingbird.

00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:25.070
So imagine what a tube to tube,
a hummingbird must look like.

00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:25.950
Very, very tiny.

00:11:25.950 --> 00:11:28.540
All the way up to an elephant
or a rhino and everything

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.170
you can think of in between for
birds, mammals and reptiles.

00:11:31.170 --> 00:11:32.670
And that's what
always fascinates me

00:11:32.670 --> 00:11:33.577
about veterinarians.

00:11:33.577 --> 00:11:35.910
Is you go to the doctor, you
can say, oh, it hurts right

00:11:35.910 --> 00:11:36.710
behind my left eye.

00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:37.793
I think its a sinus thing.

00:11:37.793 --> 00:11:40.200
Or its when I do this, it hurts.

00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:42.410
Our vets only know what
the keepers have told them

00:11:42.410 --> 00:11:45.510
they have seen as far as what
the behavior change might be

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:47.730
or how the affect of
the animal is different.

00:11:47.730 --> 00:11:49.860
And they have to
understand what it

00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.470
could be through their
medicine teaching.

00:11:52.470 --> 00:11:54.010
Now, what's super
interesting to me,

00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:56.790
though, is, of course, every
animal species is different.

00:11:56.790 --> 00:11:59.230
And then you make that leap
from mammal to bird or bird

00:11:59.230 --> 00:11:59.730
to reptile.

00:11:59.730 --> 00:12:02.130
We have the same veterinarian
doing the same work

00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:03.520
on all these different species.

00:12:03.520 --> 00:12:05.186
It's truly fascinating,
the work they do

00:12:05.186 --> 00:12:08.472
and the quality of
care that they offer.

00:12:08.472 --> 00:12:09.680
So we're going to stop there.

00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:11.020
I think we have another animal
we're going to bring out.

00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:12.590
This is Dr. Schroeder
a bit later.

00:12:12.590 --> 00:12:14.450
But we'll get to this
slide in a moment.

00:12:14.450 --> 00:12:16.840
We have another animal to
share with you that might be--

00:12:16.840 --> 00:12:17.881
I just want to make sure.

00:12:17.881 --> 00:12:20.110
Now, there's nobody that
doesn't like snakes, right?

00:12:20.610 --> 00:12:21.760
SPEAKER: We heard a gasp.

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.330
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:22.330 --> 00:12:23.470
RICK SCHWARTZ:
There's one runner.

00:12:23.470 --> 00:12:25.303
We always have one in
every group that runs.

00:12:25.303 --> 00:12:26.271
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:26.271 --> 00:12:26.770
All right.

00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.170
Well, this is Julius Squeezer.

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.130
And Julius Squeezer
is a Burmese python.

00:12:33.130 --> 00:12:35.400
Now, we get this
question a lot with him.

00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.490
Is he the biggest snake?

00:12:36.490 --> 00:12:39.310
Burmese python are usually
considered in the top five

00:12:39.310 --> 00:12:41.650
of snakes, as far as largest.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:43.960
The reticulated
python and anaconda

00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:46.590
usually are the two that we hear
the most about being largest.

00:12:46.590 --> 00:12:48.610
But the reticulated
tends to be on record

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:51.532
for being the longest, where
the Anaconda, the heaviest.

00:12:51.532 --> 00:12:53.490
It's much thicker but
not quite as long animal.

00:12:53.490 --> 00:12:54.985
SPEAKER: Oh, he's looking at me.

00:12:54.985 --> 00:12:55.380
RICK SCHWARTZ: Oh, he's yawning.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.588
SPEAKER: Oh it's yawning, OK.

00:12:56.588 --> 00:12:57.796
[CHUCKLES]

00:12:57.796 --> 00:12:59.650
RICK SCHWARTZ: So
first off, of course,

00:12:59.650 --> 00:13:02.080
snakes are very slimy
and gross, right?

00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.574
No, they're not slimy.

00:13:03.574 --> 00:13:04.240
They look slimy.

00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.180
So you can see how
Julius, right now,

00:13:05.180 --> 00:13:06.670
he's got a nice shine to him.

00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:08.395
Think of him more as
a well waxed floor,

00:13:08.395 --> 00:13:10.344
or a nicely polished car.

00:13:10.344 --> 00:13:12.010
And then you get that
wet sort of shine.

00:13:12.010 --> 00:13:12.400
Same thing.

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:13.690
They're very dry
and very smooth.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:16.231
If they were wet and slimy, they
would move more like a slug.

00:13:16.231 --> 00:13:18.204
They'd leave a
slime trail along.

00:13:18.204 --> 00:13:19.870
But they're very dry
and smooth, so they

00:13:19.870 --> 00:13:21.619
can move quickly through
their environment

00:13:21.619 --> 00:13:22.870
with minimal friction.

00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:24.550
Another myth we hear
a lot about is they

00:13:24.550 --> 00:13:25.730
flick their tongue
in and out meaning

00:13:25.730 --> 00:13:26.860
they're about to strike.

00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.880
Not necessarily true either.

00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:30.730
They're really have
the opportunity

00:13:30.730 --> 00:13:32.622
to sense their
environment by flicking

00:13:32.622 --> 00:13:33.580
that tongue in and out.

00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:37.030
So when you smell some
nice, freshly brewed coffee

00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:39.080
or cupcakes or a
muffin or something

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:40.870
like that, you
really draw that in

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.850
because you have sensory
cells up in your nose

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:44.110
that tell your brain
what you're smelling.

00:13:44.110 --> 00:13:46.270
You're actually taking
in microscopic particles

00:13:46.270 --> 00:13:48.774
of that substance
into your nostrils.

00:13:48.774 --> 00:13:50.440
Now, snakes have
nostrils, but it's just

00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.648
for breathing air in and out.

00:13:51.648 --> 00:13:52.840
There's no sensory up there.

00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:55.390
The tongue, however, picks
up those same microscopic

00:13:55.390 --> 00:13:57.790
particles you and I smell,
brings it into the mouth,

00:13:57.790 --> 00:14:00.640
on the roof of the mouth
of the same sensory cells

00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.340
that tell the brain of the
snake what it's smelling.

00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:06.370
Now right now, Julius does not
smell any rats, so Julius is,

00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:08.080
like, yeah, kind
of a boring place.

00:14:08.080 --> 00:14:09.750
They do have eyes,
obviously, as well.

00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:10.790
SPEAKER: He, like,
camouflages with the carpet.

00:14:10.790 --> 00:14:11.180
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:11.410
RICK SCHWARTZ: I know, right?

00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.785
When he goes on
the carpet, it's,

00:14:12.785 --> 00:14:14.130
like, that could be just gone.

00:14:14.130 --> 00:14:16.380
It's perfect camouflage,
though, for the forest floor.

00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.320
They can be found in sort of the
not quite a full rain forest,

00:14:20.320 --> 00:14:21.630
but somewhat forested area.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:24.027
So the leaf litter and an
organic material on the floor.

00:14:24.027 --> 00:14:26.610
That perfect thing, though, it's
kind of like your floor here.

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:27.710
Good camouflage like that.

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:29.500
But like I was saying,
they do have eyes.

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:30.880
But think of it more
of what they can see

00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:33.280
is like a black and white
photo that's out of focus.

00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:36.490
More contrast and shapes
and shadows and clarity.

00:14:36.490 --> 00:14:39.700
They do have the nerves and some
of the bone structure for ears,

00:14:39.700 --> 00:14:41.290
but it's encapsulated
in the head.

00:14:41.290 --> 00:14:42.790
Most of the sound
they're picking up

00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:45.080
is through vibrations
coming into their jaw.

00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:47.007
So, really, their main
sense for this species,

00:14:47.007 --> 00:14:49.090
especially, is going to
be the flicking in and out

00:14:49.090 --> 00:14:50.050
of the tongue.

00:14:50.050 --> 00:14:53.084
Some species of snakes
do have better eyesight.

00:14:53.084 --> 00:14:55.750
And some do have those heat pits
that can pick up different heat

00:14:55.750 --> 00:14:57.130
sensory that way.

00:14:57.130 --> 00:14:58.930
So just kind of
depends on the species.

00:14:58.930 --> 00:15:02.110
But in general, these are all
kind of basic snake facts.

00:15:02.110 --> 00:15:03.610
Of course, now,
being a constrictor,

00:15:03.610 --> 00:15:04.960
that means whatever
it catches it has

00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:05.980
to be able to swallow it whole.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:07.310
Well, that's actually
true for all snakes.

00:15:07.310 --> 00:15:08.726
They swallow all
their food whole.

00:15:08.726 --> 00:15:10.870
General rule of thumb,
they'll eat something

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.970
about four times the
size of their head.

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:16.570
So that would be like you
swallowing a watermelon whole.

00:15:16.570 --> 00:15:17.930
That's pretty impressive.

00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:20.260
Now, they don't actually
unhinge their jaw.

00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.230
There's an extra bone in there
with some very stretchy rubber

00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:24.740
band-like ligaments.

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:27.692
So that'll stretch and open
up nice and wide on the sides.

00:15:27.692 --> 00:15:29.900
And up front, there's a
stretching ligament, as well,

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.630
which allows it to expand to
the left and to the right.

00:15:32.630 --> 00:15:34.600
And then they'll move
their jaw independently

00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:37.750
to work like a conveyor belt
to send that food on down.

00:15:37.750 --> 00:15:39.640
One last fun fact about snakes.

00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:41.110
For the longest
time, studies that

00:15:41.110 --> 00:15:42.719
were done on these
big constrictors,

00:15:42.719 --> 00:15:45.010
it was always believed, even
with small constrictors as

00:15:45.010 --> 00:15:47.320
well, when they grab their
prey and squeeze down,

00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:48.520
what they're doing
is suffocating it

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:49.978
because the animal
can't breathe in

00:15:49.978 --> 00:15:52.510
as they constrict down and
so, eventually, it passes out.

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.510
And that was the thought
process between all

00:15:55.510 --> 00:15:58.540
snakes up until, I believe,
it was about six years ago,

00:15:58.540 --> 00:16:00.290
there was a study done
by Carnegie Mellon,

00:16:00.290 --> 00:16:03.362
and I believe it
was Smithsonian Zoo.

00:16:03.362 --> 00:16:05.820
They went with larger snakes
to test the pressure that they

00:16:05.820 --> 00:16:07.630
are exerting in a constriction.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:11.469
They found that the pressure
is so strong and so quick,

00:16:11.469 --> 00:16:13.510
that it will actually stop
the blood from flowing

00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:15.093
through the body and
seizes the heart.

00:16:15.093 --> 00:16:16.780
A much faster and
painless way to go

00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:20.110
compared to the thought
process of strangulation

00:16:20.110 --> 00:16:20.950
or suffocation.

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:22.140
SPEAKER: Thoughtful
to their prey.

00:16:22.140 --> 00:16:22.660
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:23.250
Yeah, right.

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.208
It's very kind of them.

00:16:24.208 --> 00:16:25.455
Very kind of them.

00:16:25.455 --> 00:16:27.580
All right, we'll bring
Julius around one more time.

00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:28.540
SPEAKER: So why's he so sleepy?

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:29.531
When does he sleep?

00:16:29.531 --> 00:16:31.030
RICK SCHWARTZ: Well,
the thing about

00:16:31.030 --> 00:16:32.620
snakes when they
get to be this big,

00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:34.036
there's really not
a lot of reason

00:16:34.036 --> 00:16:35.480
to move around or be active.

00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:36.520
They're kind of
just pretty chill.

00:16:36.520 --> 00:16:38.769
He probably fell asleep on
the ride up here, honestly.

00:16:38.769 --> 00:16:40.420
They're not fully
nocturnal, but they

00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:42.140
do tend to be a little more
active in the nighttime hours.

00:16:42.140 --> 00:16:42.790
SPEAKER: Thank you ladies.

00:16:42.790 --> 00:16:43.040
Yes.

00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:44.740
RICK SCHWARTZ: Thank
you guys very much.

00:16:44.740 --> 00:16:46.090
AUDIENCE: How do the breathe?

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:46.930
RICK SCHWARTZ: They
breathe through their nose.

00:16:46.930 --> 00:16:49.482
They have two little holes up
front, and it comes right in.

00:16:49.482 --> 00:16:51.190
Just like you and I
breathe, essentially.

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:52.750
You know, inside
their body, they

00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.530
have all the same
things you and I have.

00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:57.520
I could talk for the entire
half hour about cool snake

00:16:57.520 --> 00:16:58.480
adaptations.

00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:00.880
But, essentially, the tail
is only a very small portion

00:17:00.880 --> 00:17:01.690
at the end.

00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:03.340
And so from the neck
to that tail point

00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:05.089
they have everything
you have in your body

00:17:05.089 --> 00:17:07.859
just elongated in a tubular
system, essentially.

00:17:07.859 --> 00:17:10.800
One long, giant lung
and one smaller lung.

00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:11.680
They're fascinating.

00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:12.869
It really is.

00:17:12.869 --> 00:17:14.485
But speaking of
fascinating, our slide

00:17:14.485 --> 00:17:18.030
right here, Dr. Schroeder,
after he was been with the zoo

00:17:18.030 --> 00:17:21.930
for so long as the head doctor
for veterinary medicine,

00:17:21.930 --> 00:17:24.919
he moved on to New York to
lead one of the zoo's out there

00:17:24.919 --> 00:17:27.210
and then was asked to come
back and join us when we had

00:17:27.210 --> 00:17:29.400
one of our directors retire.

00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:32.130
And he then had this
idea that, you know,

00:17:32.130 --> 00:17:34.151
we can't-- this
is probably 1960s.

00:17:34.151 --> 00:17:34.650
OK.

00:17:34.650 --> 00:17:35.483
To give you an idea.

00:17:35.483 --> 00:17:37.252
1960s, he had this
thought, we can't keep

00:17:37.252 --> 00:17:38.460
taking animals from the wild.

00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:39.509
It's not sustainable.

00:17:39.509 --> 00:17:41.550
How many people in the
1960s were really thinking

00:17:41.550 --> 00:17:43.950
about animal welfare
and conservation?

00:17:43.950 --> 00:17:45.210
Not a whole lot.

00:17:45.210 --> 00:17:47.460
So he thought we should do
this breeding program where

00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:49.460
we breed these animals
here in the United States

00:17:49.460 --> 00:17:51.030
and supply zoos
with those animals.

00:17:51.030 --> 00:17:53.130
And he thought it'd be cool if
we did this in the San Pasqual

00:17:53.130 --> 00:17:53.790
Valley.

00:17:53.790 --> 00:17:55.560
You know where I'm
going with this, right?

00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:58.050
So he's tried to pitch that
to the city, to the board.

00:17:58.050 --> 00:17:59.940
Everyone's, like, you're crazy.

00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:00.580
There's no way.

00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:02.580
So the thing about
conservation and animal care,

00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:04.079
it's a major financial loss.

00:18:04.079 --> 00:18:06.120
There's very little chance
to earn a lot of money

00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:06.540
and make money.

00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:08.498
So when you try to pitch
it to business people,

00:18:08.498 --> 00:18:10.320
they usually don't want
to be a part of it.

00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:12.024
Well, he was very visionary.

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.440
So this picture
is actually of him

00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.290
out there in San Pasqual Valley
once he got the OK to do this.

00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:17.910
He's hammering in
the stakes for where

00:18:17.910 --> 00:18:19.764
they put the original tram.

00:18:19.764 --> 00:18:21.180
So the original
monorail tram that

00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:24.300
went out there, the
director of our organization

00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:25.440
plotted that trail.

00:18:25.440 --> 00:18:27.410
So pretty impressive.

00:18:27.410 --> 00:18:29.640
The stories about this guy
and everything he's done

00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:31.420
is pretty remarkable.

00:18:31.420 --> 00:18:33.780
This shot here, is once
we had giraffe out there

00:18:33.780 --> 00:18:36.390
in the open areas of what
we now call the Safari Park.

00:18:36.390 --> 00:18:39.850
At the time it was, I believe,
San Diego Zoo's San Pasqual

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.130
Wild Animal Park.

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:43.144
And over the years,
since it opened in 1972,

00:18:43.144 --> 00:18:45.060
it's gone through many
different name changes.

00:18:45.060 --> 00:18:47.984
But currently, we're at
San Diego Zoo Safari Park.

00:18:47.984 --> 00:18:49.650
It looks a lot different
now, of course.

00:18:49.650 --> 00:18:52.320
But this was our original
giraffe herd out there.

00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:54.540
And, again, it was very
visionary thought process

00:18:54.540 --> 00:18:58.080
that we need to create a very
large, open space to breed

00:18:58.080 --> 00:18:59.610
these animals.

00:18:59.610 --> 00:19:00.822
Dr. Schroeder knew.

00:19:00.822 --> 00:19:02.280
He knew people
would be interested,

00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.360
and they'd want to see it.

00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:04.350
Everyone else wasn't too sure.

00:19:04.350 --> 00:19:06.550
They initially weren't going
to open it to the public.

00:19:06.550 --> 00:19:08.008
But after the first
year of animals

00:19:08.008 --> 00:19:11.340
being out there and traffic
being backed up on highway 78,

00:19:11.340 --> 00:19:13.287
he was, like, see.

00:19:13.287 --> 00:19:14.870
So they opened it
up to the public in,

00:19:14.870 --> 00:19:16.800
I believe, it was May of 1972.

00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:19.260
And it's been going
strong ever since.

00:19:19.260 --> 00:19:21.630
So here's a great shot of
one of our white rhinos.

00:19:21.630 --> 00:19:23.595
We're well known for
breeding our white rhinos.

00:19:23.595 --> 00:19:25.470
And then the monorail,
the original monorail,

00:19:25.470 --> 00:19:26.550
in the background there.

00:19:26.550 --> 00:19:28.980
I always get asked, why did
they take away the monorail?

00:19:28.980 --> 00:19:30.530
The company that
built the monorail

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.220
was a European company that
went under years and years ago.

00:19:33.220 --> 00:19:35.100
Long before we took
the monorail away,

00:19:35.100 --> 00:19:36.690
our awesome mechanics
were actually

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:39.300
machining parts for this
thing to keep it going.

00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:40.590
And eventually, it got to
the point where they just

00:19:40.590 --> 00:19:42.512
couldn't-- without
completely rebuilding it--

00:19:42.512 --> 00:19:43.470
couldn't keep it going.

00:19:43.470 --> 00:19:46.020
So we've now gone to a
biofuel system that's

00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:50.370
not on a monorail, so multiple
ones can be going, if need be.

00:19:50.370 --> 00:19:52.890
Then, of course, this takes
us to our more current day

00:19:52.890 --> 00:19:53.535
as well.

00:19:53.535 --> 00:19:55.410
We have a lot of different
safari experiences

00:19:55.410 --> 00:19:56.880
at the Safari Park.

00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:59.040
Our goal is not to
just have world class

00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:01.440
care for our animals and
work with conservation

00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:04.389
around the world, which we do,
but also to offer our guests

00:20:04.389 --> 00:20:05.430
these unique experiences.

00:20:05.430 --> 00:20:06.670
One thing we've
definitely found,

00:20:06.670 --> 00:20:08.450
and I think you guys might
have already experienced

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:10.460
a little with the two
animals we've had out here,

00:20:10.460 --> 00:20:11.850
would you have that
opportunity to be

00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:13.516
up close with an
animal, the opportunity

00:20:13.516 --> 00:20:16.890
to look at its adaptations and
its attributes, have it, maybe,

00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:17.880
look you in the eye.

00:20:17.880 --> 00:20:19.050
It changes you.

00:20:19.050 --> 00:20:21.250
And we hope that it
changes you for the better.

00:20:21.250 --> 00:20:22.904
To get you to maybe
think about what

00:20:22.904 --> 00:20:25.320
you can do for conservation,
whether it's on a local level

00:20:25.320 --> 00:20:27.450
or on a grander level and
then some of the projects

00:20:27.450 --> 00:20:28.500
that we do.

00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.050
So we're going to go to
this next animal coming up,

00:20:31.050 --> 00:20:33.720
and we're going talk about how
our goal is to end extinction.

00:20:33.720 --> 00:20:35.730
And we have some more slides
to support our conservation

00:20:35.730 --> 00:20:36.300
work as well.

00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:40.260
But this particular owl coming
out right now, this is Dudley.

00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.100
He's not a baby.

00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.080
He's a full grown owl.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:44.487
Anybody know the species?

00:20:44.487 --> 00:20:46.320
They live right here
in Southern California.

00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:47.310
AUDIENCE: Screech owl.

00:20:47.310 --> 00:20:48.185
RICK SCHWARTZ: Close.

00:20:48.185 --> 00:20:50.450
Screech owls are
very close in size.

00:20:50.450 --> 00:20:51.450
AUDIENCE: Burrowing owl.

00:20:51.450 --> 00:20:52.616
RICK SCHWARTZ: There you go.

00:20:52.616 --> 00:20:53.910
I heard the guess.

00:20:53.910 --> 00:20:54.790
Hi, buddy.

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:56.040
How are you?

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:57.100
Dudley's a burrowing owl.

00:20:57.100 --> 00:20:57.570
SPEAKER: He's a curious fellow.

00:20:57.570 --> 00:20:58.830
RICK SCHWARTZ: He is.

00:20:58.830 --> 00:21:01.740
Burrowing owls have
really had a rough go

00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.740
here in Southern California and
their other native habitats.

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:07.030
Because as we grow
our urban areas,

00:21:07.030 --> 00:21:08.670
we grow right into
their natural area

00:21:08.670 --> 00:21:09.900
of where they want to live.

00:21:09.900 --> 00:21:13.585
And a lot of the animals that
burrow into the ground that

00:21:13.585 --> 00:21:14.460
create their burrows.

00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:15.330
They don't burrow themselves.

00:21:15.330 --> 00:21:17.550
They kind of take over
other abandoned burrows.

00:21:17.550 --> 00:21:19.860
We have eradicated a lot
of those species, too.

00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:22.530
So it makes it very challenging
for this species to thrive.

00:21:22.530 --> 00:21:24.488
And they're really
important with the ecosystem

00:21:24.488 --> 00:21:27.030
because they eat a lot of
different bugs, small rodents,

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:28.170
and small reptiles.

00:21:28.170 --> 00:21:31.330
And so they help really
establish a balanced ecosystem.

00:21:31.330 --> 00:21:34.380
So when we lose this apex
predator that the owl is,

00:21:34.380 --> 00:21:35.880
we start to see an
influx of things,

00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:38.070
and we have other
problems that occur.

00:21:38.070 --> 00:21:39.990
When we take away the
burrowing animals,

00:21:39.990 --> 00:21:41.531
and they can't live
there any longer,

00:21:41.531 --> 00:21:43.500
too, it changes the
soil, so it changes how

00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:45.340
the plants can grow as well.

00:21:45.340 --> 00:21:47.230
And so that impacts
our watershed.

00:21:47.230 --> 00:21:50.040
So all of a sudden, you see how
tied in all these things are--

00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:50.520
SPEAKER: Everything's connected.

00:21:50.520 --> 00:21:51.700
RICK SCHWARTZ: --to
one little species.

00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:52.290
Yeah, everything is connected.

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:54.200
SPEAKER: So how many
of them are left?

00:21:54.200 --> 00:21:55.920
RICK SCHWARTZ: There's
pockets of several thousand

00:21:55.920 --> 00:21:57.000
throughout Southern California.

00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:58.110
And the really
cool thing is we've

00:21:58.110 --> 00:21:59.850
been able to partner with a
lot of government agencies

00:21:59.850 --> 00:22:00.690
recently.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.790
And there's multiple
agencies working together now

00:22:02.790 --> 00:22:04.530
to put safe haven.

00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:07.319
And we're reintroducing
a lot of the species that

00:22:07.319 --> 00:22:08.110
make their burrows.

00:22:08.110 --> 00:22:11.069
So ground squirrels here,
and pocket mice as well.

00:22:11.069 --> 00:22:13.360
We're working on projects
here in San Diego County that

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:16.660
are reestablishing that, so they
can also re-establish, then,

00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:18.260
their territories as well.

00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.170
We've had ongoing
studies at the Safari

00:22:20.170 --> 00:22:22.870
Park and the Zoo about
what's best housing.

00:22:22.870 --> 00:22:24.790
Because there are
fewer burrows for them,

00:22:24.790 --> 00:22:26.440
we're creating man-made
burrows to help

00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.190
get them established as well.

00:22:28.190 --> 00:22:30.790
So a lot of the work we
do in the zoo environment

00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:33.160
is very important
for, then, what

00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:35.890
we can do in the
conservation in the field

00:22:35.890 --> 00:22:37.550
and work with that there.

00:22:37.550 --> 00:22:39.040
And Dudley's a
great example, too,

00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:41.740
how even as a small
animal, he still

00:22:41.740 --> 00:22:44.200
has all those great
things a predator has.

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.540
Nice sharp talons.

00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:47.740
A very sharp beak as well.

00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.360
They will live in a burrow.

00:22:49.360 --> 00:22:52.629
Mom will lay probably
anywhere from six to 12 eggs.

00:22:52.629 --> 00:22:54.670
They'll stay there in the
burrow for a little bit

00:22:54.670 --> 00:22:56.980
and then fledge around
four months or so.

00:22:56.980 --> 00:22:58.430
Again, it was really cool, too.

00:22:58.430 --> 00:23:01.880
They have seen them
stashing some of their food.

00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.890
We don't see that
in owls very often.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:06.250
Usually an owl eats what
it catches right away.

00:23:06.250 --> 00:23:08.110
Burrowing owls,
they can be active

00:23:08.110 --> 00:23:09.510
at daytime or nighttime hours.

00:23:09.510 --> 00:23:11.740
And if they catch more food than
they're going eat in a moment,

00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:13.090
they'll stash it
in their burrow.

00:23:13.090 --> 00:23:14.881
So it's actually kind
of interesting to see

00:23:14.881 --> 00:23:16.387
that behavior in an owl.

00:23:16.387 --> 00:23:18.220
SPEAKER: So how does
the operation all work?

00:23:18.220 --> 00:23:19.678
Because you have
the San Diego Zoo.

00:23:19.678 --> 00:23:21.549
You have the Safari Park.

00:23:21.549 --> 00:23:22.340
It's all connected.

00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.130
RICK SCHWARTZ:
It's all connected.

00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:23.630
Yeah.

00:23:23.630 --> 00:23:26.350
So early on, of course, San
Diego Zoo started in 1916.

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.966
The early 1970s, the
Safari Park is all

00:23:29.966 --> 00:23:31.090
under San Diego Zoo Global.

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:33.070
So I talked earlier
about the Zoological

00:23:33.070 --> 00:23:34.570
Society of San
Diego, the nonprofit

00:23:34.570 --> 00:23:35.609
that Dr. Harry started.

00:23:35.609 --> 00:23:37.150
We're now called
San Diego Zoo Global

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.040
because we are a global entity.

00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.190
We have over, I believe,
130 conservation projects

00:23:42.190 --> 00:23:44.690
around the world and roughly
about 70 different countries

00:23:44.690 --> 00:23:47.500
along with the Zoo, the
Safari Park, and our Institute

00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:49.000
for Conservation Research.

00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.140
So that kind of brings
us into our next slide.

00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.805
San Diego Zoo Global, as
a nonprofit organization,

00:23:53.805 --> 00:23:55.930
oversees all three of those
entities along with all

00:23:55.930 --> 00:23:57.250
those conservations.

00:23:57.250 --> 00:23:59.800
And it's great because our
guests can come and enjoy

00:23:59.800 --> 00:24:01.664
the parks, but they
can also join us

00:24:01.664 --> 00:24:02.830
in our conservation efforts.

00:24:02.830 --> 00:24:05.819
And to kind of have some
fun visuals for that.

00:24:05.819 --> 00:24:07.360
The Americas, here,
kind of show some

00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:09.109
of the projects we're
working on currently

00:24:09.109 --> 00:24:11.350
or have worked on in the past.

00:24:11.350 --> 00:24:13.600
Kind of a brief overview of
all the different species

00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:16.162
from Andean condor to California
condor, thick-billed parrot.

00:24:16.162 --> 00:24:17.620
You'll even see
there's some cactus

00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:19.536
and other plants in there.

00:24:19.536 --> 00:24:21.160
Certainly, near the
very bottom, you'll

00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:24.430
see the alala, which is the
Hawaiian crow, a species

00:24:24.430 --> 00:24:27.700
fundamentally extinct in the
wild for the last three years

00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:29.172
or more, I believe.

00:24:29.172 --> 00:24:30.880
We have just reintroduced
a group of them

00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:32.830
back into the wild
there in Hawaii.

00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:35.630
And it's so important, too,
because they are a seed

00:24:35.630 --> 00:24:39.010
disperser for native species
of Hawaiian plants that cannot

00:24:39.010 --> 00:24:42.490
grow properly in the habitat
without the crow supporting

00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:43.300
the seed dispersal.

00:24:43.300 --> 00:24:46.330
So, again, you see how it's
all tied together that way.

00:24:46.330 --> 00:24:48.070
This slide here
shows what we refer

00:24:48.070 --> 00:24:50.196
to as old-world Africa
and Asia and Europe,

00:24:50.196 --> 00:24:51.820
and a lot of the
projects we're working

00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:54.320
on around the world, including
some of our work in Australia

00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.270
as well.

00:24:55.270 --> 00:24:58.720
I had the pleasure of going
off the coast of Queensland

00:24:58.720 --> 00:25:01.400
to do some of our koala
research there as well.

00:25:01.400 --> 00:25:02.980
So it's really just wonderful.

00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.637
And the great thing
about all of these

00:25:04.637 --> 00:25:06.220
projects that we
talk about, and we're

00:25:06.220 --> 00:25:07.928
kind of running through
quickly because I

00:25:07.928 --> 00:25:10.460
know we're running tight on
time, all of these projects,

00:25:10.460 --> 00:25:12.280
we send our keeper
staff out there,

00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:13.780
we send our
veterinarians out there.

00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:15.850
The people who have
had hands-on experience

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:17.440
caring for these
animals in close

00:25:17.440 --> 00:25:19.670
proximity can be so
useful in conservation

00:25:19.670 --> 00:25:21.670
when you're dealing with
sick or injured animals

00:25:21.670 --> 00:25:24.710
out there in the wild and
be able to set up programs.

00:25:24.710 --> 00:25:26.710
One of the more active
programs, we're currently

00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:28.300
working on African penguins.

00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:30.910
And our Africa Rocks just
opened last summer at the Zoo.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:31.980
SPEAKER: I was going to
ask you, what's next?

00:25:31.980 --> 00:25:34.438
RICK SCHWARTZ: Well, that's
just launched this last summer,

00:25:34.438 --> 00:25:35.410
was Africa Rocks.

00:25:35.410 --> 00:25:38.320
And with that, we have
our African penguins.

00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.200
And we have keepers that are
going to Africa to work there

00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.210
at the conservation site at
the southern tip of Africa.

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:45.190
It's called SANCCOB.

00:25:45.190 --> 00:25:47.290
It's, I believe,
something about--

00:25:47.290 --> 00:25:48.730
I don't remember the acronym
as far off the top of my head--

00:25:48.730 --> 00:25:50.324
but essentially
about seabirds, they

00:25:50.324 --> 00:25:52.240
take care of all these
sick and injured birds.

00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:53.864
And we're talking
hundreds of penguins.

00:25:53.864 --> 00:25:55.720
And they're a critically
endangered species.

00:25:55.720 --> 00:25:57.920
And so to have a
seasoned staff to be

00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:00.860
able to go in and take care and
help and train other people,

00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.470
and then come back to the zoo
and take the knowledge they

00:26:02.470 --> 00:26:03.850
have and share that
with our audience

00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:05.850
that we have at the zoo,
it's absolutely wonderful.

00:26:05.850 --> 00:26:07.180
SPEAKER: How do
you transport them?

00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:08.710
RICK SCHWARTZ: The
people or the animals?

00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:09.585
SPEAKER: The animals.

00:26:09.585 --> 00:26:11.970
RICK SCHWARTZ: [LAUGHS]
It depends on the species.

00:26:11.970 --> 00:26:14.260
It depends on where they
need to be transported to.

00:26:14.260 --> 00:26:17.390
Essentially, though, we have--

00:26:17.390 --> 00:26:20.254
So, again, depending upon
the distance and the type

00:26:20.254 --> 00:26:21.670
of transportation
for the species,

00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:24.610
we basically come up with
the most appropriate and safe

00:26:24.610 --> 00:26:26.550
travel crate for
them that allows

00:26:26.550 --> 00:26:28.300
them to move properly,
eat properly, drink

00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:30.820
properly, but still be
safe while traveling, too.

00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.700
So, of course, you can't
put a seat belt on them.

00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.671
So with that, I think--

00:26:34.671 --> 00:26:35.170
Oh.

00:26:35.170 --> 00:26:36.250
This slide here
kind of gives you

00:26:36.250 --> 00:26:38.530
a quick overview that, you
know, that whether you think

00:26:38.530 --> 00:26:40.690
they're really cute like the
baby elephant or the cheetah,

00:26:40.690 --> 00:26:42.970
or not so cute as a condor,
they're all important.

00:26:42.970 --> 00:26:44.320
We do take care of all of them.

00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:45.580
And this slide's
particularly important

00:26:45.580 --> 00:26:46.720
because with the
cheetahs, there's

00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:48.190
a bottleneck in the genetics.

00:26:48.190 --> 00:26:50.980
And we were told that you could
never successfully save them.

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.020
The breeding program
we have is, I believe,

00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.010
we're over 60-some babies
now, and the program

00:26:55.010 --> 00:26:56.440
is going exceptionally well.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:58.370
With the California
condor, when the last few

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.910
were brought in in
the 80s, we were

00:27:00.910 --> 00:27:02.260
told that it would never work.

00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:03.350
They were just
going to go extinct.

00:27:03.350 --> 00:27:04.350
There were only 22 left.

00:27:04.350 --> 00:27:07.250
There's now over 480 in
the population, about half

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:09.620
of that flying back in the
wild where they belong.

00:27:09.620 --> 00:27:11.210
And the same with African
elephants, the challenges

00:27:11.210 --> 00:27:11.810
we face there.

00:27:11.810 --> 00:27:13.684
We're being told that
it may not be something

00:27:13.684 --> 00:27:15.470
you can do to save them.

00:27:15.470 --> 00:27:17.080
But, realistically,
we believe we can.

00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.121
So we're working on that.

00:27:18.121 --> 00:27:20.580
So with that, I think
we have one more animal.

00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.225
It's going to come out for you.

00:27:22.225 --> 00:27:24.350
The videos, too, to play,
but I heard the clickers.

00:27:24.350 --> 00:27:26.430
I know she's out.

00:27:26.430 --> 00:27:28.250
We'll do the videos
after the serval.

00:27:28.250 --> 00:27:31.449
AUDIENCE: When you said
the bottleneck in genetics,

00:27:31.449 --> 00:27:32.356
what does that mean?

00:27:32.356 --> 00:27:33.980
RICK SCHWARTZ:
Essentially, some people

00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.800
believe that there are too
few left in the population

00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:39.860
to offer up enough
diversity to allow

00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.810
them to thrive in the future.

00:27:42.810 --> 00:27:45.110
So sometimes what you see in
a bottleneck of population

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:47.324
is inbreeding concerns.

00:27:47.324 --> 00:27:49.490
And then you have health
deterioration, other things

00:27:49.490 --> 00:27:50.910
that get passed on.

00:27:50.910 --> 00:27:53.240
But we believe with using
the science that we have,

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:56.180
we can best mitigate
those challenges

00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.180
and offer up as much diversity
as possible with what there is.

00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:00.590
So this is not a
cheetah, though.

00:28:00.590 --> 00:28:01.960
For those of you who
went, aww, a cheetah.

00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:02.751
It's not a cheetah.

00:28:02.751 --> 00:28:03.290
Sorry.

00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:05.510
We refer to this sometimes
as the poor man's cheetah,

00:28:05.510 --> 00:28:07.301
but there's nothing
poor about this animal.

00:28:07.301 --> 00:28:09.080
So she actually ties
into the video we're

00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:10.246
going to watch here shortly.

00:28:10.246 --> 00:28:13.460
It's the giraffe cat,
or the giraffe of cats.

00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:15.050
It's an African serval.

00:28:15.050 --> 00:28:17.540
They have the longest
legs of any cat

00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:21.050
in relation to the body
size and also the largest

00:28:21.050 --> 00:28:23.240
ears in relation to body size.

00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:26.040
Those giant ears-- now, this is
a full grown cat, by the way.

00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.020
She's not going
to get any bigger.

00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.360
We always get asked, when is
she going to grow into our ears?

00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:30.734
They use their
ears for listening

00:28:30.734 --> 00:28:32.060
for birds flying towards them.

00:28:32.060 --> 00:28:34.700
They can actually leap 10
feet or more into the air

00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.010
and grab that bird out of
mid-flight to feed on it.

00:28:37.010 --> 00:28:38.900
They will also listen
for rodents underground

00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:41.870
and time their pounce just
right to grab that rodent as it

00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:43.490
comes up from underground.

00:28:43.490 --> 00:28:45.350
You might notice her short tail.

00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:47.672
Sometimes we get asked,
what happened to her tail?

00:28:47.672 --> 00:28:49.130
Well, nothing
happened to her tail.

00:28:49.130 --> 00:28:50.930
As Bella does come by, just
don't reach out for her.

00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:52.250
And those of you standing
in the aisle, just kind of

00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:53.010
stand off to the
side a little bit.

00:28:53.010 --> 00:28:54.110
Give her some room.

00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.609
Definitely can appreciate her,
just don't reach out for her.

00:28:56.609 --> 00:28:58.700
You'll see Ashley's
offering food from the hand.

00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:00.580
If you reach your hand out,
and there's no food in it,

00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.060
your hand becomes a food, and
that's a lot of paperwork.

00:29:03.060 --> 00:29:04.550
I don't want to
do that paperwork.

00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:05.800
So just admire her from there.

00:29:05.800 --> 00:29:06.270
There you go.

00:29:06.270 --> 00:29:07.670
You see the white spots
on the back of the ears?

00:29:07.670 --> 00:29:08.810
Oh, I was talking
about the tail.

00:29:08.810 --> 00:29:11.060
The tail is short because
they don't need a long tail.

00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:12.320
A tail is used for balance.

00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.170
Leopards and jaguars, cheetahs,
all have these nice long tails.

00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:17.670
They need it for balance whether
they're climbing or chasing

00:29:17.670 --> 00:29:18.500
their prey.

00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:22.297
Snow leopards do a lot of rock
climbing, nice long bushy tail.

00:29:22.297 --> 00:29:24.380
Animals that don't do a
lot of climbing or chasing

00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:26.390
don't need that tail, so it
would just get in the way.

00:29:26.390 --> 00:29:27.620
They're a leaper and a pouncer.

00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:29.150
They're going to stay
in a static position

00:29:29.150 --> 00:29:30.620
and leap straight up
to grab their prey.

00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:31.910
Or they're going to stay
in that static position

00:29:31.910 --> 00:29:33.540
and leap a distance
to grab their prey.

00:29:33.540 --> 00:29:34.730
A long tail would
just get in the way.

00:29:34.730 --> 00:29:35.780
It's not needed.

00:29:35.780 --> 00:29:38.120
The white spots you see
on the back of the ears

00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:40.580
are sometimes referred to
me as "follow me" spots.

00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:41.990
It is believed by
some scientists

00:29:41.990 --> 00:29:43.684
that the kittens can
follow mom easier

00:29:43.684 --> 00:29:45.350
with the contrast of
the black and white

00:29:45.350 --> 00:29:46.980
on the back of
the ear like that.

00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:49.280
Another theory out there
is that if Bella had just

00:29:49.280 --> 00:29:51.530
captured some prey, and
she's got her head down,

00:29:51.530 --> 00:29:53.732
and she's eating
it, those ears--

00:29:53.732 --> 00:29:56.094
she's not going to
get you-- those ears,

00:29:56.094 --> 00:29:57.510
whether she was
sitting like this,

00:29:57.510 --> 00:29:58.880
and I was a predator
sneaking up to get her.

00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:00.880
Or she was looking down,
and I was coming at her

00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:03.307
to get her to steal her
food, that's a big deal.

00:30:03.307 --> 00:30:04.390
Servals are great hunters.

00:30:04.390 --> 00:30:06.598
They are one of the few cats
that have a high success

00:30:06.598 --> 00:30:08.134
rate of kill per attempt.

00:30:08.134 --> 00:30:10.550
So a lot of animals are going
to want to steal their food.

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.682
If at a distance, I thought
those were eyes looking

00:30:12.682 --> 00:30:14.390
at me with that black
and white contrast,

00:30:14.390 --> 00:30:16.580
I would either stop
my forward movement,

00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:17.930
or I'd try and circle around.

00:30:17.930 --> 00:30:19.763
Either way, buying her
more time or possibly

00:30:19.763 --> 00:30:22.599
giving away my actual location
because those aren't really her

00:30:22.599 --> 00:30:23.390
eyes looking at me.

00:30:23.390 --> 00:30:24.641
Her eyes are forward that way.

00:30:24.641 --> 00:30:25.973
SPEAKER: And what is she eating?

00:30:25.973 --> 00:30:26.930
RICK SCHWARTZ: Meat.

00:30:26.930 --> 00:30:30.140
We have a carnivore meat diet
for all of our carnivores.

00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:31.634
It is a beef-base
sort of ground.

00:30:31.634 --> 00:30:33.050
It looks kind of
like a hamburger,

00:30:33.050 --> 00:30:34.857
but you wouldn't want
it in your burger.

00:30:34.857 --> 00:30:36.190
It's got a lot more stuff in it.

00:30:36.190 --> 00:30:37.731
SPEAKER: Is she a
tough one to train?

00:30:37.731 --> 00:30:38.720
She looks pretty lovey.

00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.100
RICK SCHWARTZ: Not really, Yeah.

00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:42.410
We find servals and most
of our cat species--

00:30:42.410 --> 00:30:44.243
as much as people say
you can't train a cat.

00:30:44.243 --> 00:30:44.840
You can.

00:30:44.840 --> 00:30:47.090
Consistency is key for
any training, of course.

00:30:47.090 --> 00:30:50.330
But definitely for our servals,
they are a willing animal.

00:30:50.330 --> 00:30:52.490
They enjoy coming out
and doing the work.

00:30:52.490 --> 00:30:54.830
And they do understand the
concept of a food reward

00:30:54.830 --> 00:30:55.340
situation.

00:30:55.340 --> 00:30:57.590
And you can see, she's nice and
calm over there, hanging out,

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.400
having a good time.

00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.610
And they're more than
happy to do stuff for us

00:31:00.610 --> 00:31:03.129
and show off their
different attributes.

00:31:03.129 --> 00:31:04.670
Can Bella stay out
for a bit while we

00:31:04.670 --> 00:31:05.870
run through these
videos real quick?

00:31:05.870 --> 00:31:06.410
I don't know.

00:31:06.410 --> 00:31:07.840
Is there a button I need
to push for the videos?

00:31:07.840 --> 00:31:09.140
SPEAKER: Yeah, just click it.

00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:09.500
RICK SCHWARTZ: All right.

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:09.980
SPEAKER: There you go.

00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:11.021
RICK SCHWARTZ: All right.

00:31:11.021 --> 00:31:13.970
This is a short video of
our most recently opened

00:31:13.970 --> 00:31:17.140
giraffe orphanage in Kenya.

00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:20.120
So the giraffe calf in
the giraffe orphanage.

00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:22.332
Unfortunately,
giraffe are in peril.

00:31:22.332 --> 00:31:24.290
We have a lot of focus
and a lot of information

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:27.760
out there about elephants due
to tusk poaching and rhinos

00:31:27.760 --> 00:31:29.120
due to horn poaching.

00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:30.890
Unfortunately, the
giraffe is also

00:31:30.890 --> 00:31:32.930
dealing with
degradation of habitat

00:31:32.930 --> 00:31:35.690
and also being used as
target practice by poachers.

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.866
So all of a sudden, we
realize through research,

00:31:37.866 --> 00:31:39.740
they have dropped their
population immensely.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:42.470
And when the adults are,
unfortunately, poached as well,

00:31:42.470 --> 00:31:45.022
we have babies that
are in need of care.

00:31:45.022 --> 00:31:46.730
The gentleman that's
doing the care here,

00:31:46.730 --> 00:31:49.354
he is in charge of the orphanage
along with the other gentlemen

00:31:49.354 --> 00:31:52.550
you saw, that was one of
our researchers helping out.

00:31:52.550 --> 00:31:55.730
We're funding this orphanage and
sending our vet staff out there

00:31:55.730 --> 00:31:59.660
and offering up different milk
for the giraffe to grow on.

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:01.550
But what's most, for
me, the gentleman

00:32:01.550 --> 00:32:03.290
you see in the video right now.

00:32:03.290 --> 00:32:05.940
You ask the folks
that work there,

00:32:05.940 --> 00:32:07.540
you ask them why do you do this?

00:32:07.540 --> 00:32:09.240
Why is it important to you?

00:32:09.240 --> 00:32:12.300
And because they grew up with
these animals in their life,

00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:15.574
they heard goats or cows
in the same environment.

00:32:15.574 --> 00:32:17.490
The ones that do the
herding are the children.

00:32:17.490 --> 00:32:19.944
So they grow up with the
zebra and the giraffe.

00:32:19.944 --> 00:32:21.110
And they tell me every time.

00:32:21.110 --> 00:32:23.110
When I've ever asked,
whether it's for the zebra

00:32:23.110 --> 00:32:25.710
or for the giraffe, they say
because they're my friends.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:26.857
This is who I grew up with.

00:32:26.857 --> 00:32:29.190
And to think that they could
go extinct and no longer be

00:32:29.190 --> 00:32:31.279
with us, I can't
let that happen.

00:32:31.279 --> 00:32:32.820
So they literally
dedicate their life

00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:35.278
to doing the work that you just
saw there at the orphanage.

00:32:35.278 --> 00:32:36.290
And it's tough work.

00:32:36.290 --> 00:32:37.050
That's the middle of Kenya.

00:32:37.050 --> 00:32:38.820
There's not a whole lot of
facilities around there.

00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:39.420
I think there's--

00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:39.830
SPEAKER: Wow, that's amazing.

00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:40.800
We have one more video, right?

00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:40.920
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:42.720
One more video about
giraffe conservation.

00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:44.344
Again, one of our
most recent projects.

00:32:44.344 --> 00:32:46.480
We've really been
doing a lot of work.

00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:49.842
And we're working with
different organizations.

00:32:49.842 --> 00:32:50.550
It's not just us.

00:32:50.550 --> 00:32:51.440
It must be said.

00:32:51.440 --> 00:32:52.740
Others zoos work together.

00:32:52.740 --> 00:32:54.930
Other organizations like
the Kenya Wildlife Services

00:32:54.930 --> 00:32:55.440
as well.

00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:57.930
And we do giraffe tracking
where part of the program

00:32:57.930 --> 00:33:00.150
where teams will go out,
what you see right there.

00:33:00.150 --> 00:33:03.410
They knock the giraffe down
with a chemical knock down,

00:33:03.410 --> 00:33:04.250
so it's a dart.

00:33:04.250 --> 00:33:06.000
And they are fastening
something no bigger

00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:08.550
than a small cell phone to
one of the ossicones, which

00:33:08.550 --> 00:33:09.610
is like a horn.

00:33:09.610 --> 00:33:11.160
In the next shot
coming up, you'll

00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:12.785
see it looks like a
little pager on it,

00:33:12.785 --> 00:33:15.350
strapped to the top
of the one there.

00:33:15.350 --> 00:33:18.400
That is a satellite tracker
that'll last three years.

00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.150
It allows us to track them
from the comfort of San Diego

00:33:21.150 --> 00:33:21.738
or wherever.

00:33:21.738 --> 00:33:25.330
The patterns of that giraffe
tell what kind of habitat

00:33:25.330 --> 00:33:28.530
they need, where they're
going, how they interface

00:33:28.530 --> 00:33:30.076
with other giraffe as well.

00:33:30.076 --> 00:33:31.950
And it really gives us
a better understanding

00:33:31.950 --> 00:33:33.780
of giraffes in the wild
because you can't always

00:33:33.780 --> 00:33:34.854
be there where the are.

00:33:37.436 --> 00:33:38.810
So those are the
two short videos

00:33:38.810 --> 00:33:39.950
I have on our
giraffe conservation.

00:33:39.950 --> 00:33:41.630
I know you had one more
video to share, too.

00:33:41.630 --> 00:33:42.230
SPEAKER: Yeah, I have--

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:42.735
RICK SCHWARTZ: With our tie in--

00:33:42.735 --> 00:33:43.490
SPEAKER: --one video.

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:44.735
RICK SCHWARTZ: --of our
organization and yours.

00:33:44.735 --> 00:33:45.420
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:49.160
So hopefully, I mean, hopefully,
you all know your own Google

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.120
history.

00:33:50.120 --> 00:33:53.000
But we're definitely
tied to the San Diego Zoo

00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.470
as well, aside from just this
office celebrating you guys.

00:33:56.470 --> 00:33:59.572
But I'm going to show
you a quick video.

00:33:59.572 --> 00:34:00.530
JAWED KARIM: All right.

00:34:00.530 --> 00:34:04.230
So here we are in
front of the elephants.

00:34:04.230 --> 00:34:08.072
The whole thing about these
guys is that they have really,

00:34:08.072 --> 00:34:12.060
really, really long trunks.

00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.900
And that's cool.

00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:17.737
And that's pretty much
all there is to say.

00:34:17.737 --> 00:34:20.070
SPEAKER: So I don't know if
you all remember this video.

00:34:20.070 --> 00:34:21.909
It was shot in 2005.

00:34:21.909 --> 00:34:23.679
This is the first
official YouTube video

00:34:23.679 --> 00:34:29.170
ever uploaded by the co-founder
of the website back then.

00:34:29.170 --> 00:34:30.909
And he's at the San Diego Zoo.

00:34:30.909 --> 00:34:34.150
So if you also know
there's a team at Google

00:34:34.150 --> 00:34:36.972
called "the zoo," which
is a creative team.

00:34:36.972 --> 00:34:39.180
But we're definitely connected
to this San Diego Zoo,

00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:42.370
and I thought it was something
to bring it back to us

00:34:42.370 --> 00:34:43.921
and our culture
and the connection.

00:34:43.921 --> 00:34:45.670
RICK SCHWARTZ: And one
thing we definitely

00:34:45.670 --> 00:34:47.460
say about that, it's fun to have
that connection with you guys

00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.709
because every time YouTube
celebrates its anniversary,

00:34:49.709 --> 00:34:50.832
our name comes up as well.

00:34:50.832 --> 00:34:52.540
San Diego Zoo has been
around long enough

00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:54.044
and is known well
enough that we're

00:34:54.044 --> 00:34:55.210
in a lot of cultural things.

00:34:55.210 --> 00:34:57.550
In different movies it
comes up, or TV shows,

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:58.430
it comes up as well.

00:34:58.430 --> 00:34:59.690
So that's always fun for us.

00:34:59.690 --> 00:35:01.210
But one of the key takeaways.

00:35:01.210 --> 00:35:04.180
If there's nothing else
that this particular video

00:35:04.180 --> 00:35:06.220
shows is the San
Diego Zoo couldn't

00:35:06.220 --> 00:35:09.280
be what it is or do what
it does without the support

00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.840
we have in San Diego proper.

00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:14.530
Our membership is one of the
largest memberships anywhere

00:35:14.530 --> 00:35:15.370
in zoos.

00:35:15.370 --> 00:35:17.080
Our community support
has always been

00:35:17.080 --> 00:35:20.440
way above the par for any
organization on any given

00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:23.160
year for a nonprofit that runs
a Zoological Society as well.

00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.660
So we're really proud to be
part of the San Diego community.

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:27.951
We're proud of the support
we always get from San Diego

00:35:27.951 --> 00:35:31.390
as well, whether it's for a
YouTube video, our local parks,

00:35:31.390 --> 00:35:33.640
or even some of the conservation
we talked about today

00:35:33.640 --> 00:35:35.446
around the world.

00:35:35.446 --> 00:35:37.300
SPEAKER: Well, I'm
going to open it up

00:35:37.300 --> 00:35:40.270
to a couple questions in the
audience if they have any.

00:35:40.270 --> 00:35:43.299
I'll just repeat your question,
so that the video can catch it

00:35:43.299 --> 00:35:43.840
for you guys.

00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:45.714
But do we have any
questions in the audience?

00:35:48.606 --> 00:35:50.230
RICK SCHWARTZ: I see
a couple of hands.

00:35:50.230 --> 00:35:50.730
Which one?

00:35:50.730 --> 00:35:51.655
Who has their hand--

00:35:51.655 --> 00:35:52.155
OK.

00:35:52.155 --> 00:35:52.720
Go, Hadi.

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:54.178
AUDIENCE: Did the
satellite tracker

00:35:54.178 --> 00:35:56.538
they could have for
three years, does it

00:35:56.538 --> 00:35:59.380
stay without any need
to recharge that?

00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:02.020
SPEAKER: So is there a need to
recharge the satellite trackers

00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:02.645
on the giraffe?

00:36:02.645 --> 00:36:05.140
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yeah, usually
what will happen is--

00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.370
so short answer, yes.

00:36:06.370 --> 00:36:08.251
But what happens is the
straps will wear out

00:36:08.251 --> 00:36:10.750
from the weather in those three
years, and it will fall off.

00:36:10.750 --> 00:36:13.640
And we can usually retrieve
it before the battery dies.

00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.405
And so that allows us to
reuse the system that way.

00:36:16.405 --> 00:36:18.280
And usually two to three
years of information

00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.710
from a single giraffe is
sufficient to gather what

00:36:20.710 --> 00:36:22.040
we need from that individual.

00:36:22.040 --> 00:36:24.140
And we can then
utilize that tool

00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.520
to gather it from
another individual.

00:36:26.520 --> 00:36:27.400
SPEAKER: Up here?

00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:29.840
AUDIENCE: With the
issue of poaching,

00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:32.768
right, across the
globe, what type

00:36:32.768 --> 00:36:34.720
of extra security measures--

00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:37.160
I'm assuming that if you
go into certain regions

00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:38.740
there's additional
threats, right?

00:36:38.740 --> 00:36:41.070
So not only the livelihood
of the animals, but also

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:44.950
the humans that are there to
assist-- what type of effort

00:36:44.950 --> 00:36:49.310
goes into planning and
protecting both the animals

00:36:49.310 --> 00:36:49.810
and humans?

00:36:49.810 --> 00:36:52.420
SPEAKER: So the question
was around the precautions.

00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:54.330
There's all these
dangers around poaching.

00:36:54.330 --> 00:36:58.510
What is the zoo doing from
San Diego local and then

00:36:58.510 --> 00:37:02.644
also across all the conservation
areas you guys have?

00:37:02.644 --> 00:37:04.810
RICK SCHWARTZ: First to
address what the threats are

00:37:04.810 --> 00:37:06.520
and how it's being addressed.

00:37:06.520 --> 00:37:09.460
For lack of a better term,
there are rangers deployed

00:37:09.460 --> 00:37:10.630
that are trained.

00:37:10.630 --> 00:37:14.680
And most recently, they have
also given these rangers

00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:19.300
an extra tool of guard dogs,
both from the shepherd type

00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:22.570
attitude dog that has
to grab and obtain

00:37:22.570 --> 00:37:25.810
a person of interest, but also
hound dogs to find the people,

00:37:25.810 --> 00:37:26.929
to track them.

00:37:26.929 --> 00:37:28.720
I was fortunate enough,
when I was in Kenya

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:31.630
a couple of years ago, I got
to play the part of a poacher.

00:37:31.630 --> 00:37:35.470
And I went and hid off
in this washout area.

00:37:35.470 --> 00:37:37.120
And we were able to
get that on film.

00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.340
We made a nice little video--

00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:39.970
it's on YouTube, by the way--

00:37:39.970 --> 00:37:43.390
that shows how they use the
dogs to track poachers and find

00:37:43.390 --> 00:37:43.891
people.

00:37:43.891 --> 00:37:46.098
It was a really great
experience to be a part of that

00:37:46.098 --> 00:37:46.790
and see that.

00:37:46.790 --> 00:37:48.400
So if you look at
places, there's

00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.140
organization we work
with called Lewa.

00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:50.842
It's in Kenya.

00:37:50.842 --> 00:37:52.300
They have had no
poaching, I think,

00:37:52.300 --> 00:37:56.110
for the last two or three years
because of the large population

00:37:56.110 --> 00:37:58.900
of rangers they have hired
along with these dogs.

00:37:58.900 --> 00:38:02.230
The Rangers have also found,
and Lewa works very, very hard

00:38:02.230 --> 00:38:05.770
to get the community outlying
of the secure park area

00:38:05.770 --> 00:38:08.140
to be a part of the
larger community.

00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:09.640
Because that way,
when some stranger

00:38:09.640 --> 00:38:11.015
comes and starts
asking questions

00:38:11.015 --> 00:38:12.460
about rhinos or
elephants, they're

00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:13.910
going to tell their
friends or the rangers.

00:38:13.910 --> 00:38:15.460
The rangers can go check
out what's going on,

00:38:15.460 --> 00:38:16.700
and it's been very effective.

00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:18.435
Now, that model works
really well there.

00:38:18.435 --> 00:38:19.810
There are other
places where they

00:38:19.810 --> 00:38:21.809
don't have the funding,
necessarily, to do that,

00:38:21.809 --> 00:38:24.210
or they haven't
gotten there yet.

00:38:24.210 --> 00:38:25.930
And others, where
sometimes, the poachers

00:38:25.930 --> 00:38:27.471
are just more
aggressive than they're

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:29.890
going to expect, coming in
with military-style vehicles,

00:38:29.890 --> 00:38:31.556
essentially, in the
middle of the night.

00:38:31.556 --> 00:38:34.120
So what we're doing as an
organization-- we fund a lot.

00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:37.840
We partner up with these groups,
whether it's Lewa or Northgate,

00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:40.240
or all these other
organizations we work with,

00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:41.324
and we helped raise money.

00:38:41.324 --> 00:38:43.823
We're really good at raising
money because of the support we

00:38:43.823 --> 00:38:44.899
have in San Diego.

00:38:44.899 --> 00:38:45.940
And we funnel that money.

00:38:45.940 --> 00:38:48.927
As a nonprofit, it's very easy
for us to do those fundraisers,

00:38:48.927 --> 00:38:51.010
take some of our ticket
sales, whatever it may be,

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:52.785
and funnel that
money over to areas

00:38:52.785 --> 00:38:54.910
that need that help so they
can fund those rangers,

00:38:54.910 --> 00:38:57.782
fund that equipment, fund the
dog care, and things like that.

00:38:57.782 --> 00:38:58.990
And it works out pretty well.

00:38:58.990 --> 00:39:00.600
SPEAKER: That's great to
partner with you guys.

00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:01.060
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:39:01.060 --> 00:39:02.684
SPEAKER: Here, a
question in the front.

00:39:02.684 --> 00:39:08.786
AUDIENCE: For predator type
animals, in Safari Park,

00:39:08.786 --> 00:39:11.997
do you have environments for
them to actually hunt, or are

00:39:11.997 --> 00:39:15.507
they eating everything
that's provided by staff.

00:39:15.507 --> 00:39:17.590
RICK SCHWARTZ: You want
to ask the question again?

00:39:17.590 --> 00:39:18.131
Or should I--

00:39:18.131 --> 00:39:19.140
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.146
RICK SCHWARTZ: OK.

00:39:20.146 --> 00:39:21.520
So what he's
asking, essentially,

00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:23.519
is do the predators we
have have the opportunity

00:39:23.519 --> 00:39:25.750
to express the natural
behavior of hunting

00:39:25.750 --> 00:39:28.240
in the environments we have
at the Safari Park or Zoo?

00:39:28.240 --> 00:39:31.090
Short answer is not
exactly but kind of.

00:39:31.090 --> 00:39:33.220
So the food they consume.

00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:34.120
We do not feed--

00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:34.820
SPEAKER: Pokey's
out again, guys.

00:39:34.820 --> 00:39:35.020
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yes.

00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:36.280
Pokey's out for Q&amp;A, as well.

00:39:36.280 --> 00:39:37.840
We thought it would be fun to
have the animals out doing Q&amp;A

00:39:37.840 --> 00:39:39.070
to keep you guys entertained.

00:39:39.070 --> 00:39:43.030
But the predators we have,
the food they consume

00:39:43.030 --> 00:39:44.050
is already deceased.

00:39:44.050 --> 00:39:48.790
Now, some will have a rabbit or
a rat such as our large snake

00:39:48.790 --> 00:39:49.976
you saw out earlier.

00:39:49.976 --> 00:39:51.850
Our large carnivores
get carnivore meat diet,

00:39:51.850 --> 00:39:53.110
sort of a mixture of things.

00:39:53.110 --> 00:39:54.890
Plus they have femur
bones to chew on,

00:39:54.890 --> 00:39:56.950
so they can express
with chewing behaviors.

00:39:56.950 --> 00:39:58.730
But we recognize,
sometimes, that if you

00:39:58.730 --> 00:40:00.105
you're to feed
out a live animal,

00:40:00.105 --> 00:40:01.690
there's a lot of
responsibilities

00:40:01.690 --> 00:40:03.314
that you would have
to that live animal

00:40:03.314 --> 00:40:05.620
as well until the predator
makes the proper kill.

00:40:05.620 --> 00:40:10.927
So with that, we choose not to
go that route with the largers.

00:40:10.927 --> 00:40:12.760
I guess sort of a side
note to that, though.

00:40:12.760 --> 00:40:16.540
Just the other day, we gave
large mouth bass, live ones,

00:40:16.540 --> 00:40:18.040
to our polar bears,
so they could

00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.720
express the hunting of fish.

00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.820
So, you know, checks
and balances on that.

00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.450
But as far as letting a
deer go in the lion exhibit,

00:40:25.450 --> 00:40:26.380
no, we don't do that.

00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:27.751
[CHUCKLES]

00:40:27.751 --> 00:40:29.396
SPEAKER: Last question.

00:40:29.396 --> 00:40:31.693
AUDIENCE: Could you share
one of the local conservation

00:40:31.693 --> 00:40:32.192
[INAUDIBLE]?

00:40:32.192 --> 00:40:34.522
In addition to the burrowing
owl, there's other birds--

00:40:34.522 --> 00:40:36.220
RICK SCHWARTZ: Oh certainly.

00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:37.960
The list is too
long to answer now.

00:40:37.960 --> 00:40:42.190
I would just say, first off,
go to endextinction.org.

00:40:42.190 --> 00:40:44.650
That's kind of our landing site
for all of our conservation

00:40:44.650 --> 00:40:45.940
including local stuff.

00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:49.870
But yes, cactus wren,
pocket mouse, burrowing owl.

00:40:49.870 --> 00:40:51.930
Well, there is burrowing owl.

00:40:51.930 --> 00:40:52.900
You know, all of those.

00:40:52.900 --> 00:40:54.620
And then a lot of
plant species as well.

00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:56.210
People don't realize
our Institute

00:40:56.210 --> 00:40:59.020
for Conservation Research has
a whole horticulture wing where

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:00.790
they harvest seeds
from endangered species

00:41:00.790 --> 00:41:02.590
we have right here in San Diego.

00:41:02.590 --> 00:41:04.060
Fun fact for you.

00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:07.060
From coast to mountain,
San Diego County

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:10.831
is the most species-diverse
county in the United States.

00:41:10.831 --> 00:41:12.080
Think about that for a second.

00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:12.730
That's pretty impressive.

00:41:12.730 --> 00:41:15.040
You live right there in
the most diverse county,

00:41:15.040 --> 00:41:16.750
but we also have
a lot of growth.

00:41:16.750 --> 00:41:18.400
So we see a lot
of these habitats

00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.770
being changed and
having some challenges.

00:41:20.770 --> 00:41:23.110
A lot of plant species
having problems too.

00:41:23.110 --> 00:41:25.690
So our teams will go
out and harvest seeds

00:41:25.690 --> 00:41:27.490
and also grow and
germinate those plants.

00:41:27.490 --> 00:41:29.982
And then we have areas where,
similar to our animals,

00:41:29.982 --> 00:41:32.440
we set up for these conservation
sites to grow those plants

00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:34.940
and give them that stronghold
to bring that environment back

00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:36.922
to where it should be.

00:41:36.922 --> 00:41:37.810
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:41:37.810 --> 00:41:39.970
Well, thank you so much,
Rick, for joining us.

00:41:39.970 --> 00:41:42.400
For bringing all your
furry and non-furry animals

00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.860
and your staff to
take care of them.

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.200
Congratulations for all of
your work and conservation

00:41:47.200 --> 00:41:47.991
and what's to come.

00:41:47.991 --> 00:41:49.202
I'm sure there's more.

00:41:49.202 --> 00:41:51.160
And hopefully, you all
visit the San Diego Zoo,

00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.000
if you haven't already.

00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:52.270
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:41:52.270 --> 00:41:54.311
And for those of you
watching, too, San Diego Zoo

00:41:54.311 --> 00:41:55.630
has a great YouTube channel.

00:41:55.630 --> 00:41:56.870
So you can hop over
there and check that out.

00:41:56.870 --> 00:41:57.360
SPEAKER: Oh, I love that.

00:41:57.360 --> 00:41:58.105
I didn't even tell you
to say all these things.

00:41:58.105 --> 00:41:58.855
RICK SCHWARTZ: No.

00:41:58.855 --> 00:42:00.320
We're very active
on social media.

00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:02.590
You can find San Diego Zoo
or the SDZ Safari Park.

00:42:02.590 --> 00:42:04.240
That's the handle
for two facilities.

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:05.330
And if you have any
questions for me,

00:42:05.330 --> 00:42:06.730
you can always hit me up
as Zookeeper Rick, too.

00:42:06.730 --> 00:42:08.902
I love interacting on
social media for everybody,

00:42:08.902 --> 00:42:10.360
answering questions
about wildlife,

00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.500
and sharing fun facts, too.

00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:12.045
SPEAKER: Awesome.

00:42:12.045 --> 00:42:13.720
Well, thank you so much
all for coming out.

00:42:13.720 --> 00:42:14.600
RICK SCHWARTZ: Yeah.

00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:15.100
Thank you.

00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:15.810
Appreciate it.

00:42:15.810 --> 00:42:16.935
SPEAKER: See you next time.

00:42:16.935 --> 00:42:19.160
