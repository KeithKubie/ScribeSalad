00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:08.510
Easter eggs related to Star Wars in non-Star
Wars movie franchises are very common.

00:00:08.510 --> 00:00:12.600
Hollywood seems to love giving a nod to the
iconic sci-fi franchise and Disney movies

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:16.779
are no exception to that rule - especially
now that Star Wars is owned and distributed

00:00:16.779 --> 00:00:19.010
by the mass media and entertainment conglomerate.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:22.640
Whether it be the classic animated movies
we all know and love, the Marvel Studios movies

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:27.199
that Disney now distributes, or otherwise,
Disney movies are teaming with Star Wars Easter

00:00:27.199 --> 00:00:28.840
eggs - and that's what this video is all about.

00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:33.430

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:37.429
Here are ten Star Wars Easter eggs you may
have missed in other Disney movies.

00:00:37.429 --> 00:00:38.429
Captain America: Civil War
2016's Captain America: Civil War saw a very

00:00:38.429 --> 00:00:39.429
explicit reference to 1980's The Empire Strikes
Back, with the movie being mentioned out loud

00:00:39.429 --> 00:00:40.429
in the epic airport battle between Team Captain
America and Team Iron Man.

00:00:40.429 --> 00:00:41.429
It happens after Scott Lang has grown to become
Giant-Man and Team Iron Man are struggling

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.429
to take him down.

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:43.429
Tom Holland's Spider-Man refers to the scene
in The Empire Strikes Back "on the snow planet,

00:00:43.429 --> 00:00:44.429
with the walking thingies" and proceeds to
wrap his webbing around the huge superhero's

00:00:44.429 --> 00:00:45.429
legs - in the same way the AT-AT's legs were
wrapped up - allowing Iron Man and War Machine

00:00:45.429 --> 00:00:46.429
to take him down with relative ease.

00:00:46.429 --> 00:00:47.429
Up
There's a very cool Star Wars Easter egg in

00:00:47.429 --> 00:00:48.429
the final credit sequence of 2009's Up, so
if you stuck around for them, you may well

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:49.429
have seen it.

00:00:49.429 --> 00:00:50.429
In the middle of the credits, there's an image
of the movie's two main protagonists, Carl

00:00:50.429 --> 00:00:52.249
and Russell, exiting a screening of the original
Star Wars at a movie theatre.

00:00:52.249 --> 00:00:55.889
Russell clearly seems to have enjoyed the
movie and is looking categorically buoyant

00:00:55.889 --> 00:01:00.289
as he points to the movie's title on the movie
theatre's sign, whereas Carl looks a lot less

00:01:00.289 --> 00:01:03.809
impressed with it!

00:01:03.809 --> 00:01:09.440
The Sorcerer's Apprentice
In 2010's The Sorcerer's Apprentice, there's

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:14.470
a scene in which Alfred Molina's Maxim Horvath
- an evil sorcerer and the nemesis of Nicolas

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:18.780
Cage's Balthazar - tries to get past the New
York University administrator, who is asking

00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:26.100
him to show ID, by using magic to persuade
him.

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.630
Because of the fact that his actions and tone
of voice are very reminiscent of Obi-Wan Kenobi's

00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:35.030
in the original Star Wars movie, Toby Kebbell's
Drake responds to the situation by saying

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.390
"These are not the droids you're looking for."

00:01:41.390 --> 00:01:45.600
Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue
Arguably the most unlikely movie on this list

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:50.390
to expect a Star Wars reference to appear,
2010's sequel to both 2008's Tinker Bell and

00:01:50.390 --> 00:01:54.240
2009's Tinker Bell and the Lost Treasure,
Tinker Bell and the Great Fairy Rescue does

00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.920
indeed include a neat little Star Wars Easter
egg.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:58.970
It’s an extremely subtle Easter egg as well.

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.920
When he's making a boat for the fairies, Bobble
- voiced by Rob Paulsen - quotes Han Solo

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:11.370
from The Empire Strikes Back by saying “This
one goes there, that one goes there, right?”

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.900
Chicken Little
2005's Chicken Little also has a quote subtly

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:17.209
and directly lifted from a Star Wars movie.

00:02:17.209 --> 00:02:23.569
In 1977's Star Wars, the line "Stay on target,
stay on target!" is said when the X-Wing pilots

00:02:23.569 --> 00:02:25.159
are attempting to blow up the Death Star.

00:02:25.159 --> 00:02:28.530
In Chicken Little, "Ace" - the movie version
of the titular character within the movie

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:32.519
- repeats this line while navigating his ship
through space to defeat some aliens.

00:02:32.519 --> 00:02:36.569
Incidentally, there also happens to be a reference
to Darth Vader being Luke's father in the

00:02:36.569 --> 00:02:39.290
movie.

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.579
Wreck-It Ralph
2012's Wreck-It Ralph has a few references

00:02:42.579 --> 00:02:45.629
to, and Easter eggs relating to, the Star
Wars movies - and we're going to tell you

00:02:45.629 --> 00:02:46.830
about a couple of them here.

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.170
For starters, there's a scene in which Ralph
is breathing through a straw in a chocolate

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.170
lake.

00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:57.400
The breathing you can hear as a result is
actually Darth Vader's breathing noise from

00:02:57.400 --> 00:02:58.529
the Star Wars movies.

00:02:58.529 --> 00:03:02.889
Moreover, there is a Star Wars arcade game
that can clearly be seen in a wide view of

00:03:02.889 --> 00:03:04.409
Litwak's Arcade in the movie.

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:08.090
The Marvel Cinematic Universe
We now come to a more general entry, as we

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:12.340
embrace the Marvel Cinematic Universe's ongoing
dedication to Star Wars homages.

00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:16.980
In pretty much every MCU Phase 2 movie, the
franchise paid tribute to 1980's The Empire

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:21.349
Strikes Back, as characters lost their hands
or arms like Luke Skywalker did when Darth

00:03:21.349 --> 00:03:22.430
Vader severed his hand.

00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:24.409
Examples include Darren Cross in Ant-Man,
Bucky Barnes in Captain America: The Winter

00:03:24.409 --> 00:03:28.859
Soldier, Aldrich Killian in Iron Man 3, Thor
in Thor: The Dark World, Groot in Guardians

00:03:28.859 --> 00:03:32.799
of the Galaxy, and Ulysses Klaue in Avengers:
Age of Ultron.

00:03:32.799 --> 00:03:35.489
Tomorrowland
There are countless Star Wars Easter eggs

00:03:35.489 --> 00:03:39.219
in Tomorrowland - the 2015 movie that takes
inspiration from a number of Disney theme

00:03:39.219 --> 00:03:42.650
parks and themed lands within Disney's theme
parks around the world.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:46.560
One of these Easter eggs is, like the recurring
MCU Easter egg, a character getting his hand

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.680
cut off by George Clooney's character Frank.

00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:52.439
But others include the Star Wars theme music
being played and a number of Star Wars-themed

00:03:52.439 --> 00:03:56.310
items in the "Blast From the Past" store in
the movie (including lightsabers, a Death

00:03:56.310 --> 00:04:01.090
Star toy and a Stormtrooper helmet), as well
as Kathryn Hahn's Ursula Gernsback having

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:04.459
hair like Prince Leia.

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:10.109
The Toy Story Movies
There are literally loads of Star Wars Easter

00:04:10.109 --> 00:04:13.660
eggs and references in the Toy Story movies
- and we'd be going all day if we mentioned

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.799
them all - so we'll just give you one from
each of Toy Story 1, 2 and 3.

00:04:17.799 --> 00:04:22.550
In 1995's Toy Story, when Buzz sees the Buzz
Lightyear commercial on TV, the sound when

00:04:22.550 --> 00:04:25.920
he "shoots" a laser is the TIE fighter's cannon
sound.

00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.040
In 1999's Toy Story 2, when a camera comes
out through a trap door in a wall, it's a

00:04:30.040 --> 00:04:35.160
nod to Jabba the Hutt's palace's camera at
the main entrance.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:39.780
And finally, in Toy Story 3, when Big Baby
throws Lotso the Bear into a dumpster, it's

00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:44.750
a reference to Darth Vader throwing Emperor
Palpatine into the reactor.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.440
Finding Dory
Whether or not you consider this to be an

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:51.940
Easter egg is open to your own interpretation,
but 2016's Finding Dory certainly has something

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.950
in common with 2015's with Star Wars: The
Force Awakens.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:59.570
The common ground comes in the form of Finding
Dory's Hank, a cranky East Pacific red octopus

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:03.170
who lost a tentacle, and the Rathtar in The
Force Awakens.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:07.310
Some of the technical ideas that shaped Hank’s
existence were indeed first utilised on the

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:56.000
tentacle predator in Episode VII - so their
rendering is pretty similar.

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.310
