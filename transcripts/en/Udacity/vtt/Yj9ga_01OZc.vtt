00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.620
What percent of the population do you think will suffer from some kind of

00:00:03.620 --> 00:00:09.186
diagnosable mental disorder in a given year? And what percent do you think will

00:00:09.186 --> 00:00:13.282
suffer from a mental disorder at some point in their entire lives. Now, of

00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:16.874
course, I don't expect you to know the exact percentage. Just take a wild guess

00:00:16.874 --> 00:00:17.979
if you don't know.
