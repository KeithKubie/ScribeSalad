00:00:00.499 --> 00:00:03.000
So the new iPhone has
a fingerprint scanner.

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.390
Exactly how secure is that?

00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:13.460
Anthony here for D News, and
biometric fingerprint scanners

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:15.330
like the one in the
iPhone aren't new.

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.630
They've been used in military
and industrial security

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:18.300
for a long time.

00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.000
You can get them on
a lot of computers,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.390
but it's still kind of a
novelty on everyday devices.

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:25.370
Fingerprints are crazy things.

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:27.900
All these little ridges are
super important to your sense

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:30.630
of touch, but they're
also a really unique form

00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:31.740
of identification.

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:34.490
Even identical twins don't
have the same fingerprints,

00:00:34.490 --> 00:00:37.320
because small differences
in pressure in the womb

00:00:37.320 --> 00:00:39.480
actually cause them
to be different.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.340
Which makes the idea of
having a fingerprint scanner

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:44.150
on your phone a really nice one.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.540
All your personal
information protected

00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.690
by the one type of
identification you have that

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:49.750
can't be forged.

00:00:49.750 --> 00:00:51.050
But here's the thing.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.490
You could have the same
fingerprint to someone else.

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.750
We just haven't come across
a case of them matching yet.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:00:59.067
It would be hard to run a
completely scientific study

00:00:59.067 --> 00:01:01.150
on whether it's true that
fingerprints are unique,

00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.990
because you would need every
fingerprint from every person

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:05.630
in the world to be 100% sure.

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:08.450
But we can safely say that
they are unique enough

00:01:08.450 --> 00:01:11.070
to protect your
selfies and your sexts.

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.850
A capacitive
fingerprint scanner is

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:16.030
a sensor made of tons
of tiny cells-- like,

00:01:16.030 --> 00:01:18.690
smaller than the ridges
on your fingertips tiny.

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:20.800
Which makes sense,
because those sensors

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.870
use the flow of electricity to
see where your fingerprints are

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.014
coming into contact
with the sensor.

00:01:26.014 --> 00:01:27.930
It's a lot like the touch
screen on the iPhone

00:01:27.930 --> 00:01:29.730
now, but much more sensitive.

00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:31.650
Other fingerprint
scanners are optical,

00:01:31.650 --> 00:01:33.260
meaning they take
a high resolution

00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.045
photo of your fingerprint
and compare it

00:01:35.045 --> 00:01:36.370
to what they have on file.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:38.850
Fingerprint scanners
have to take a lot

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.670
into account-- smudging,
dirt, all kinds of things

00:01:41.670 --> 00:01:43.634
that might give a false
positive or negative.

00:01:43.634 --> 00:01:45.050
So they don't tend
to try to match

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.460
every single piece of a
fingerprint every time.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:48.996
Once it stores
your initial print,

00:01:48.996 --> 00:01:50.370
the software in
the scanner looks

00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.080
for things like where specific
ridges split into two,

00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.220
or where your central swirl is.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:57.840
It actually takes note of where
all the distinguishing details

00:01:57.840 --> 00:01:59.810
are in comparison to
each other, and makes

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:02.640
a sort of map of landmarks
on your fingerprint.

00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.670
And then it looks for matches to
those defining characteristics

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.670
every time you touch your
finger to the scanner.

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:09.430
And depending on the
level of security

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:13.120
needed for the situation it'll
need more matches to unlock.

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:16.070
So can you fool the
fingerprint scanner?

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:16.780
Yeah.

00:02:16.780 --> 00:02:18.740
Optical scanners can
get tricked sometimes

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:21.440
by a nice high resolution
picture of a fingerprint.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.250
A capacitive one like
the iPhone's would

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:26.070
need a 3D mold of
the fingerprint.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:30.360
If someone stole your finger at
the same time as your iPhone,

00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:32.320
they could get
into it no problem.

00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:35.280
Not that I'm trying to
give anyone any ideas.

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:36.960
Anyway, at really
secure facilities,

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.060
the scanners can
actually check to see

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:42.150
if the finger is still alive
and attached to a body,

00:02:42.150 --> 00:02:42.960
so there's that.

00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:45.590
The combination of a fingerprint
scanner and the ability

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:48.550
to make wireless payments is
making a wallet and credit

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:51.460
cards and maybe even ID
cards a thing of the past.

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:53.190
I love the idea
of the simplicity,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.710
but I lose and break phones too
often to like that, I think.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:02:59.950
Plus, the scary thing about
all in one identification

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:02.120
is that when someone
does manage to hack it,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:04.480
it's much harder to
prove identity theft

00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:05.550
and get your stuff back.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.007
So, 50-50 good to
spooky ratio in my mind.

00:03:09.007 --> 00:03:10.840
