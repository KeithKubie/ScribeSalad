00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:27.560 align:start position:0%
you should be for in some sense - seems
 

00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:30.159 align:start position:0%
you should be for in some sense - seems
to<00:06:27.650><c> me</c><00:06:27.860><c> if</c><00:06:28.250><c> that's</c><00:06:29.180><c> what</c><00:06:29.390><c> life</c><00:06:29.570><c> is</c><00:06:29.600><c> for</c><00:06:29.990><c> then</c>

00:06:30.159 --> 00:06:30.169 align:start position:0%
to me if that's what life is for then
 

00:06:30.169 --> 00:06:31.570 align:start position:0%
to me if that's what life is for then
maybe<00:06:30.380><c> it</c><00:06:30.530><c> shouldn't</c><00:06:30.860><c> be</c><00:06:31.039><c> maybe</c><00:06:31.340><c> that's</c>

00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:31.580 align:start position:0%
maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's
 

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:32.230 align:start position:0%
maybe it shouldn't be maybe that's
correct

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:32.240 align:start position:0%
correct
 

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.290 align:start position:0%

because<00:06:32.960><c> that</c><00:06:33.289><c> isn't</c><00:06:33.440><c> what</c><00:06:33.650><c> life</c><00:06:33.800><c> is</c><00:06:34.180><c> but</c><00:06:35.180><c> it</c>

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.300 align:start position:0%
because that isn't what life is but it
 

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:36.909 align:start position:0%
because that isn't what life is but it
also<00:06:35.510><c> doesn't</c><00:06:35.840><c> it</c><00:06:36.020><c> isn't</c><00:06:36.229><c> obvious</c><00:06:36.560><c> to</c><00:06:36.590><c> me</c><00:06:36.770><c> that</c>
