&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington DC.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:21.830
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Hi, I'm

musicians and dancers.

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:35.370
And I just want to introduce them,

00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:38.350

So, can you, let's see
Necru how about you tell me

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.500

&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Okay.

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.140

00:00:49.140 --> 00:00:54.680
Joanna already told, my name
is Sam-Oeun Tes [inaudible].

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:03.190
I came into United States
in 1970, and I was taught

00:01:03.190 --> 00:01:06.090
in Royal Palace in Cambodia.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:14.320
I came into United States in 1970;

00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:19.740
start teaching dance
over here, 1972.

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:27.520
And we start growing
until we come to a group.

00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:36.690
19 ... Cambodian American
Heritage born in 1980.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:37.990
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Okay.

00:01:37.990 --> 00:01:40.310
Nice. How about Chum
Ngek, Master Chum.

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:41.610
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: My name Chum Ngek.

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:58.060 position:56%
I'm the, live in Cambodia from 1939,
I came to United States in 1982,

00:01:58.060 --> 00:02:03.280
and I start to teach new things.

00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:08.650
After five years later, I
start to teach music at home.

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:17.340
I'm go to help American
Heritage, and play together

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:27.500
and go together and
performing in 2004.

00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:35.000
I have art endowment and start to
learn music in like 10 years old,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.380
in Cambodia with my grandfather.

00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.710
My grandfather is the
name [inaudible],

00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:47.480
but I start with the Master
[inaudible], Master Tong,

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.900
Master Chu, Master
Chum, and Master ...

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:55.270
A lot of the teacher
[inaudible], the last one.

00:02:55.270 --> 00:03:05.320 position:56%
I start to play in group in Cambodia
with my group and another group

00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:13.200
and go to performing
in University Fine Art.

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:20.520
In 1982, and I go back to my
home to help my grandfather

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:23.880
and he is not feeling good.

00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:28.820
I cannot go back to him again.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:30.180
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: I see.

00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:32.420
Okay. Bonavy, you've been
dancing for a while now, too.

00:03:32.420 --> 00:03:34.470
How did you get into the dance?

00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:36.460
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: My aunt.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:39.560
She forced all of us
when we were kids.

00:03:39.560 --> 00:03:45.580 position:56%
But, somehow I stuck with it because
I enjoy the traditional dance.

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:49.960
Also, it helps me to learn
about my heritage because I came

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:52.460
to the United States in '82.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:56.700
I went through the
civil war of Pol Pot.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:01.000
When I came to the United States
with my mom and my aunt at age

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:08.470
of nine years old, so then to
learn about my own arts heritage.

00:04:08.470 --> 00:04:12.900
It was through dance, different
characters that I learned

00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:16.090
from different teachers
through the years.

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:22.610
I learned about, I would
say, 33 years as in training

00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:24.840
in Cambodian classical dance.

00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:33.370
But, I became a junior teacher in
year 2000 and now I do instruction

00:04:33.370 --> 00:04:39.280
with the different character:
giant, female role, male role.

00:04:39.280 --> 00:04:44.170
But, my best character
that I enjoy is the giant.

00:04:44.170 --> 00:04:46.740
It's a very powerful role.

00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.520
But it's just my body is so small,

00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:54.640
that I still like the
giant role the best.

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.180
Just has so much power and moves,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:04.320
so I enjoy the Cambodian
traditional dance very much.

00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:07.240
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: You're
like a Master almost by now.

00:05:07.240 --> 00:05:09.080
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: I'm 50% there.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:12.430
Even though I've been in the
program for 30-something years,

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.190
I'm just halfway there because
compared to the students

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:18.880
at the University of
Fine Art in Cambodia,

00:05:18.880 --> 00:05:23.400
because they train every day;
whereas when in the United State,

00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:25.290
we don't have that opportunity.

00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:28.980
So, when we train,
we train only Sundays

00:05:28.980 --> 00:05:34.280
and it's not even all year round
because we don't have that funding

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:37.200
for the program for year-round.

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.350
So, we're able to train and when
I visit home, I'm able to train

00:05:41.350 --> 00:05:44.710
from the Master teacher
from the Royal Palace.

00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:50.560
So, I have together about 10 Master
teachers, different characters,

00:05:50.560 --> 00:05:54.870
different technique,
and I enjoy that.

00:05:54.870 --> 00:05:58.040
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: How about your
history as a musician, Sovann?

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:03.030
&gt;&gt; SOVANN CHUM: I started playing
music when I was I guess, three.

00:06:03.030 --> 00:06:06.070
At five years old, I was playing
at Carnegie Hall in New York.

00:06:06.070 --> 00:06:10.720
That was my first show
playing the drums.

00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.750
I got into playing music
because of my father, of course.

00:06:14.750 --> 00:06:17.900
Kind of forced in the
beginning, which was okay.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:22.020
It helped me cultivate my culture,
understand my culture, my language.

00:06:22.020 --> 00:06:24.660
It was a great opportunity.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.220
So, I kind of developed my skill of
liking playing music after a while.

00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.500
It comes natural to me.

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:38.130
I can play basically any
instrument that's in front of me.

00:06:38.130 --> 00:06:42.840
Now, it's just a passion, it's just
hobby to do and I really enjoy it.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:47.010
It makes my father happy, so
that's always a good thing.

00:06:47.010 --> 00:06:48.840
He taught us well,
as my sister as well.

00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.390
She also plays music as well.

00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:53.660
So, as of right now I don't
have any other teachers.

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:57.450
I only had one Master
teacher and that's my father.

00:06:57.450 --> 00:07:01.440
He's a great mentor and
I look up to him a lot.

00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:02.890
I wouldn't be where
I'm at without him.

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:08.250
I appreciate everything he did
and all the awards that he won.

00:07:08.250 --> 00:07:14.410
As a professional Master musician,
I'm really, really happy for that.

00:07:14.410 --> 00:07:18.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Necru, what was it
like to learn the Cambodian dance?

00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:22.430
What was your experience like
learning Cambodian dance?

00:07:22.430 --> 00:07:27.260
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Yes, it's
very, very hard; difficult.

00:07:27.260 --> 00:07:36.650
I was trained the first time in
Cambodia in Royal in Phnom Penh.

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:45.560
I have aunt that she Master
teacher of the male role.

00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.590
She take me over there and I'm
not really quite that I'm sure

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:58.260
that I like, but that day
somehows they take that ...

00:07:58.260 --> 00:08:04.240
We go with her and she sit
down, watch the movement

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.190
of all the student dance.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:14.180
Somehow come the music,
it's go to your ear.

00:08:14.180 --> 00:08:24.910
It's just like [Khmer], mean like
something coming to your mind.

00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:35.130
I'm go back home and my
aunt asked me, "Do you like?

00:08:35.130 --> 00:08:38.110
Do go tomorrow?

00:08:38.110 --> 00:08:39.510
Go back tomorrow?"

00:08:39.510 --> 00:08:40.860
I say, "Yes."

00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.340
I was 14 years old.

00:08:44.340 --> 00:08:46.000
It's [inaudible], it's teenager.

00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.400
It's hard to move, flexible.

00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:54.740
My body was so soft, too soft.

00:08:54.740 --> 00:08:58.740
The teacher tried to
straight my body,

00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:02.080
make it strong, because
too flexible.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.940
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Oh gosh.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.730
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: But, it is hard.

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:07.910
It's very hard; difficult.

00:09:07.910 --> 00:09:15.650
The next day, I get [inaudible] and
I have long hair, and then dress

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:19.150
up like [inaudible],
and start dance.

00:09:19.150 --> 00:09:23.500
It's just come like this.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:24.800
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Overnight?

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.100
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Yeah.

00:09:26.100 --> 00:09:27.400
It's overnight.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.210
I never think about I can dance.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.400
My sister, the middle sister,

00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:37.680
she's learning every
Sunday and every Thursday.

00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:46.780 position:56%
They take from the, pick any student

00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:56.310 position:56%
or the different class, different
school, they came in every Thursday.

00:09:56.310 --> 00:10:00.260
But me? Never thinking I'm
going to go learn, but this,

00:10:00.260 --> 00:10:03.000 position:56%
I don't know it's just coming to me.

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:09.140
We start and I have 10, 12 teacher.

00:10:09.140 --> 00:10:15.160

00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:21.940
Finish all teacher came in,

One push me to learn
quickly so can go to the ...

00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:35.480
with the first group.

00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:40.540
You have first group, the leader,

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:43.010
the middle group, and
the third group.

00:10:43.010 --> 00:10:45.220
I'm on the middle group.

00:10:45.220 --> 00:10:49.440
She want to push me harder
to go to first group.

00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:51.700
My leg was like this.

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:56.960
Shake. The first I dance
in Siem Reap, first time.

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:59.450
I will learn on three month only.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:03.150
Three months, I will
dance in Siem Reap

00:11:03.150 --> 00:11:08.650
and my skirt was just
shake like this.

00:11:08.650 --> 00:11:11.620
So, depend on the teacher.

00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:16.090
If your teacher love
you, really you go.

00:11:16.090 --> 00:11:20.610
If the teacher don't
really like you,

00:11:20.610 --> 00:11:24.320
you on the backstage,
I'm sorry to say that.

00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.290
I'm really to say ...

00:11:26.290 --> 00:11:27.620
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: That's
how it works.

00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:29.190
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: It is.

00:11:29.190 --> 00:11:32.650
This is the way they do in Palace.

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:34.750
It's really strict.

00:11:34.750 --> 00:11:39.550
You beautiful, you good,
you flexible, you smart.

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:41.120
They push you quick.

00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:43.590
It's not mean on the
back they is not smart.

00:11:43.590 --> 00:11:50.210
Just the way the teacher
like, the love.

00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:51.760
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Yeah,
she pay attention to you.

00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:55.620
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Pay attention

00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:13.990 position:56%
I was learning not quite six month,
so shake, but it's not for anything.

00:12:13.990 --> 00:12:16.150
It's just scared to death.

00:12:16.150 --> 00:12:17.450
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: On the inside.

00:12:17.450 --> 00:12:18.750
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Yes, inside.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.210
After that, the butterfly is gone.

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:32.520
It came into United State and
just like, Necru, a lot of teacher

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:34.100
like [inaudible], and [inaudible].

00:12:34.100 --> 00:12:37.430
She's come and join with us.

00:12:37.430 --> 00:12:45.920
We glad that work out
to get a big group.

00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:49.730
It's very, very difficult.

00:12:49.730 --> 00:12:57.450
It's not easy to build a
big group, it's not easy.

00:12:57.450 --> 00:13:00.270
You have to know how
to pull a suitcase.

00:13:00.270 --> 00:13:07.000 position:56%
I told my niece, you become the
teacher or Master teacher they call,

00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.950
you have to know how to pull
the suitcase out, sewing,

00:13:10.950 --> 00:13:15.790
put the crown on, be sure
all the kid was learning,

00:13:15.790 --> 00:13:22.020
be sure the kid had the
food to eat, everything.

00:13:22.020 --> 00:13:23.320
Your mind is ...

00:13:23.320 --> 00:13:25.340
It's not easy.

00:13:25.340 --> 00:13:26.640 position:56%
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: More than dancing.

00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:27.940
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Yes.

00:15:59.920 --> 00:16:02.820 position:56%
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: So, Necru you
mentioned you had a lot of teachers.

00:16:02.820 --> 00:16:04.970
What did you study
with your teachers?

00:16:04.970 --> 00:16:07.230
What instruments do you play?

00:16:07.230 --> 00:16:10.490
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: The first thing
I start to play [inaudible]

00:16:10.490 --> 00:16:14.820
with my grandfather, but
before I start to play

00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:18.290
and I think I'm five
years old or something.

00:16:18.290 --> 00:16:22.970
You know the call, the percussion.

00:16:22.970 --> 00:16:29.240
I just play and take off from
the back, my grandfather.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:32.610
When he performing, we
couldn't find the [inaudible].

00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:34.290
Say, "Who took [inaudible]?"

00:16:34.290 --> 00:16:37.630
Took it, forgot to put it back.

00:16:37.630 --> 00:16:44.810
Later time he come and he find, he
ask me, "You like to play music?"

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:47.240
I say, "Yeah, I like to play it."

00:16:47.240 --> 00:16:52.730
All the time when my
grandfather taught the music,

00:16:52.730 --> 00:16:56.110
my house we had two level.

00:16:56.110 --> 00:17:00.670
The one level downstair [inaudible]
here we don't have basement.

00:17:00.670 --> 00:17:04.560
Downstair we have the whole thing.

00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:06.450
I play up-ground and downstair.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:13.000
I have stick, chopstick and when my
grandfather taught music upstair,

00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:16.090
I just play with the chopstick.

00:17:16.090 --> 00:17:22.070
After that, he asked me,
"You like playing music?"

00:17:22.070 --> 00:17:23.370
I say, "Yeah."

00:17:23.370 --> 00:17:26.070
"You like to play music, when
you start you cannot quit."

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:28.190
I say, "Yeah, I promise."

00:17:28.190 --> 00:17:34.290 position:56%
I start to play around 10 years old.

00:17:34.290 --> 00:17:38.940
I start to learn music from him.

00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:41.690
The first thing I play called ...

00:17:41.690 --> 00:17:49.410
The first song, second song,
but you know, it pulls me a lot

00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:52.990
in the morning, early morning.

00:17:52.990 --> 00:17:59.430
The water in my country, the cold,
in the mornings is very cold.

00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.710
He didn't say anything to me.

00:18:02.710 --> 00:18:06.690
He call me in the early morning
around four o'clock in the morning.

00:18:06.690 --> 00:18:08.820
You know the kid, four
o'clock they want to wake up.

00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:11.890
They want to sleep, but wake up.

00:18:11.890 --> 00:18:16.180
I say, "No, I want to sleep a
little bit before go to school."

00:18:16.180 --> 00:18:19.260
He say, "No, you promise
you want to learn music.

00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:24.000
You supposed to wake up early
morning before you go to school."

00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:26.350
I wake up in the morning.

00:18:26.350 --> 00:18:32.240
He told me, "Go to the river and-

00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.540
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: The river.

00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:34.840
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: The lake,
something like that.

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:36.780
We have the water, but
he didn't say anything.

00:18:36.780 --> 00:18:38.220
He push me like-

00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:39.520

00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:42.120
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: He push me, kick
me like that in the water.

00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.420
I say, "What happen?"

00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:50.370
He didn't say anything because
you know he didn't explain to me

00:18:50.370 --> 00:18:53.870
about what they do
for the learn music.

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:55.170
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Kicking you.

00:18:55.170 --> 00:18:57.390
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: When go hit
water, my leg is cold.

00:18:57.390 --> 00:18:59.800
It was like ...

00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.420

00:19:02.420 --> 00:19:07.130
The later time I learned he

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:15.150
The cold, you supposed
to do like that.

00:19:15.150 --> 00:19:17.820

00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.540

00:19:45.840 --> 00:19:47.140
He put my arm.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:48.440
He put my arm something like that.

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:52.780
After that, he goes me to
learn in xylophone [inaudible].

00:19:52.780 --> 00:19:57.540
And the first time,
we don't put the time.

00:19:57.540 --> 00:19:58.840
The time clock, no.

00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.320
He put the tube, you
know the tube piece?

00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:04.640

and the second day
they put all one tube.

00:20:19.280 --> 00:20:23.400
He wanted to play xylophone like

00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.270
they wanted me to [inaudible]

00:20:25.270 --> 00:20:30.500

00:20:52.960 --> 00:20:57.480

I say, "Why?

00:21:07.780 --> 00:21:12.930
You know everything, why you
didn't taught me the whole thing?

00:21:12.930 --> 00:21:18.080
Why you invited people
to taught me?"

00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:24.970
He said, "No, a lot of people,
we have special people to play.

00:21:24.970 --> 00:21:29.810

00:21:40.350 --> 00:21:41.650
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: Yeah Ton.

00:21:41.650 --> 00:21:45.290 position:56%
We have a lot of different teachers.

00:21:45.290 --> 00:21:48.490
Every instrument, we
have one teacher.

00:21:48.490 --> 00:21:50.710
Every instrument, one teacher.

00:21:50.710 --> 00:21:56.180
When I start to play,
really different.

00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:58.350
It's not from one teacher.

00:21:58.350 --> 00:21:59.720
We have a lot of teachers.

00:21:59.720 --> 00:22:01.620
We have a lot of idea.

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:07.080 position:56%
They explain to me, this one, that
song you supposed to play like this,

00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:11.510
but another teacher [inaudible]

00:22:11.510 --> 00:22:13.410 position:56%
Another teacher told me, "This way."

00:22:13.410 --> 00:22:20.390
A lot of teacher, but I have a
lot of way [inaudible] is the way,

00:22:20.390 --> 00:22:27.030
we have a lot of way to
play for the good music.

00:22:27.030 --> 00:22:35.640
Until I play around in
Cambodia, I travel a lot.

00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.190
If not, stay home.

00:22:38.190 --> 00:22:45.860
Every man came home like at 2:00,
3:00, after the school came from.

00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.100
I go around.

00:22:48.100 --> 00:22:50.360
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: It didn't confuse
you all the different teachers

00:22:50.360 --> 00:22:51.660
telling you different things?

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.160
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: No, not confuse.

00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:58.460
Explain small thing,
it's not very different.

00:22:58.460 --> 00:23:02.600
A little different just
in the way they play.

00:23:02.600 --> 00:23:06.030
Every teacher they
know all instrument.

00:23:06.030 --> 00:23:08.080
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: The basics.

00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:15.090
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: But, the special,
the one special [inaudible]...

00:23:15.090 --> 00:23:24.010
I forgot the name of that-

00:23:24.010 --> 00:23:25.310
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: [inaudible].

00:23:25.310 --> 00:23:28.340
&gt;&gt; CHUM NGEK: [inaudible], he's
the best one of the [inaudible].

00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.570

00:23:31.570 --> 00:23:40.770
I don't want to play the

00:23:40.770 --> 00:23:46.100
but my grandfather know, we
need you to play [inaudible].

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:49.610
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Wow.

00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:50.910
That's a lot.

00:23:50.910 --> 00:23:52.210
Bonavy, what makes you continue?

00:23:52.210 --> 00:23:55.760
What motivates you to keep dancing?

00:23:55.760 --> 00:24:01.280
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: Well, growing up
in America going to public school,

00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.700
they don't really teach you
about Cambodia, the heritage.

00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:10.390
All you know is the poverty
of Cambodia and the war.

00:24:10.390 --> 00:24:12.210
They don't know the arts.

00:24:12.210 --> 00:24:18.350 position:56%
So, as I was learning and
performing with different community.

00:24:18.350 --> 00:24:20.210
Then I thought to myself,

00:24:20.210 --> 00:24:25.490
if you don't preserve your heritage
the other generation will not know

00:24:25.490 --> 00:24:27.800
about their heritage at all.

00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:31.850
I'm grateful for my
aunt and Lacru to ...

00:24:31.850 --> 00:24:37.440
Even though they are in America,
they still preserve their heritage

00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.690
so that the generation
after us, they will know

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:44.950
about what Cambodia is about.

00:24:44.950 --> 00:24:50.910
Cambodian traditional dance,
it's the national dance,

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:55.160
the national arts for Cambodia.

00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:58.350
I follow everybody
at the University.

00:24:58.350 --> 00:25:07.190
I follow the teachers on Facebook
because they train every day.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.880
Their skills is so, they
have perfect the art so well.

00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:18.970
Every detail and when I follow
them I look at their training

00:25:18.970 --> 00:25:22.800
and when I do have the opportunity
to go home, I'm able to go

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.690
and ask them for help because
every teacher has their specialty

00:25:28.690 --> 00:25:34.100
in a specific role, but they
have different technique,

00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:39.920
so if you are able to get
their talent, their technique

00:25:39.920 --> 00:25:45.800
and incorporate into yourself,
then you would be a better dancer.

00:25:45.800 --> 00:25:50.890
So, even though I've been in
the program for over 30 years

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:56.780
in dancing the same dance,
but I'm still 50% there.

00:25:56.780 --> 00:26:01.520
So, I don't think I will be
able to achieve Master teacher

00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.280
yet until I'm able to
learn the other skills.

00:26:06.280 --> 00:26:10.740
And I try to do my best, but
I know there's certain things

00:26:10.740 --> 00:26:13.990
that I lack in the arts.

00:26:13.990 --> 00:26:18.150
But, I still consider
myself as a student as well

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:20.860
as teaching my next generation.

00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:22.160
It's very important.

00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:29.790
I was telling a few people
here, Americans, the public,

00:26:29.790 --> 00:26:34.300
young children, I was
able I think, a month ago,

00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:37.910
I was able to visit
a elementary school.

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:42.210
A third grade class that invited
me to do some demonstration.

00:26:42.210 --> 00:26:47.360
And it was at a urban
city public school.

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:51.670
Just because I'm just dressed like
this, they thought it was amazing.

00:26:51.670 --> 00:26:56.180
They have never seen and they never
know about Cambodian arts at all.

00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.950
All they know, they
had so many questions

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:01.460
for me and I was so surprised.

00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:05.420
They had it in their card and
they asked specific questions.

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:07.250
And it was amazing.

00:27:07.250 --> 00:27:11.180
Even though, whether
you're Cambodian or American

00:27:11.180 --> 00:27:18.450
or any generation, any children,
you need to preserve your heritage.

00:27:18.450 --> 00:27:22.210
And we need to keep continuing.

00:27:22.210 --> 00:27:28.150
The arts, music, dance; that's
part of what human being is about

00:27:28.150 --> 00:27:32.990 position:56%
and different ethnic group has their
own heritage, their own culture.

00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:39.770
And even if you live in a different
country, you still bring yourself

00:27:39.770 --> 00:27:43.860
from where you're born
into where you're going.

00:27:43.860 --> 00:27:47.810
And if you don't know that
from where you're from,

00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:50.310
then you're lacking something.

00:27:50.310 --> 00:27:55.080
So, in order for you to be a whole
as a person, you need to know

00:27:55.080 --> 00:27:56.590
where you're from, your history.

00:27:56.590 --> 00:27:59.600
Whether you're American
or Cambodian or any,

00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:02.110
you need to know your history,
you need to preserve that.

00:28:02.110 --> 00:28:06.550
You need to pass it on to the next
generation, so they don't forget

00:28:06.550 --> 00:28:10.330
and they can be a whole person.

00:28:10.330 --> 00:28:14.530
So, that's why we continue,
we push the other kids.

00:28:14.530 --> 00:28:19.300
Sometimes as a young person, you
may not want to be part of it

00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:23.790
and you get pushed by your
grandmother or mother or something

00:28:23.790 --> 00:28:25.280
like that, and you do it.

00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.910
Some people might not like it,
some people might feel that,

00:28:30.910 --> 00:28:34.230
oh maybe this is something
that I want to do.

00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:35.530
That was me.

00:28:35.530 --> 00:28:39.230
Out of my cousins, I still
stuck with the dance.

00:28:39.230 --> 00:28:42.890
It was all of us, everybody,
boy and girl.

00:28:42.890 --> 00:28:45.040
All of us, she push us.

00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.200
Every year we had to
come in and get trained.

00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:51.780
But, all my other cousins,
they stop,

00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.620 position:56%
but for me, I think it's part of me.

00:28:54.620 --> 00:29:01.480
I'm just so eager to learn and I'm
always following different videos.

00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:06.650
When I see the Master teacher,
I mean, they're so great.

00:29:06.650 --> 00:29:12.850
Even at a 80 year old, I seen one
of the teacher that does giant,

00:29:12.850 --> 00:29:15.580
she's so strong when
she do her move.

00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.360
Even though at her age, is like
when you see her it's like, "Wow,

00:29:19.360 --> 00:29:21.620
I can't even get like that."

00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:25.360
It's in your build-up.

00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:30.190
Since you practice so long and
doesn't matter if you have it.

00:29:30.190 --> 00:29:35.320
If you have the structure,
no matter how old you get,

00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:36.970
you still can do those moves.

00:29:36.970 --> 00:29:39.570
You might not be able
to do one leg up,

00:29:39.570 --> 00:29:42.590
but you can still see
the broad shoulder

00:29:42.590 --> 00:29:47.360
and the exact detail of the move.

00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:48.660
I follow them.

00:29:48.660 --> 00:29:52.710
She has no teeth, but she still do
the move and the giant is so ...

00:29:52.710 --> 00:29:54.540
I was like, "Oh my god."

00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.700
I show to my student, too.

00:29:56.700 --> 00:30:01.340
I was like, "Look at her,
she's so strong at her age."

00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:02.940
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Tell
them [inaudible].

00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:04.410
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: [inaudible],
and then the one

00:30:04.410 --> 00:30:06.530
that taught me is [inaudible].

00:30:06.530 --> 00:30:07.830
She's amazing.

00:30:07.830 --> 00:30:09.130
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: [inaudible].

00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:10.430
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: [inaudible], and
then [inaudible], and [inaudible],

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:11.730
[inaudible], my aunt,
and [inaudible].

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:13.030
I have so many teachers.

00:30:13.030 --> 00:30:14.450
I always want to learn from them.

00:30:14.450 --> 00:30:16.230
It's certain detail.

00:30:16.230 --> 00:30:25.370
It's like, you look at one teacher,
and then she does the smile,

00:30:25.370 --> 00:30:33.360
the gesture differently, and then
you learn from somewhere else,

00:30:33.360 --> 00:30:36.570
and it just all together.

00:30:36.570 --> 00:30:40.430
You just incorporate to your own.

00:30:40.430 --> 00:30:42.500
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: It
becomes a part of you, yeah.

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.490
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: Exactly.

00:30:44.490 --> 00:30:47.300
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: The movement
is a little bit different.

00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:54.460
It's much the same, it's just the
way they push you, strong or light.

00:30:54.460 --> 00:30:56.540
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: It's
a personal touch to ...

00:30:56.540 --> 00:30:58.200
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: The way they move.

00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.500
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Wow.

00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:02.360
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: The
technique is classical dance.

00:31:02.360 --> 00:31:04.370
It's really, really hard.

00:31:04.370 --> 00:31:06.120 position:56%
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: Have to be precise.

00:31:06.120 --> 00:31:09.900
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: If one teacher
push you, you have to stick that.

00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:13.090
If another one come
in, you have to follow.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:15.340
You have to use your mind, too.

00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:19.330
Which one you want to choose?

00:31:19.330 --> 00:31:23.830
It's like my aunt, my Master ...

00:31:23.830 --> 00:31:25.480
She's [inaudible].

00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:29.530
She is just like a king.

00:31:29.530 --> 00:31:40.240
If she come in dance,
she is like a man.

00:31:40.240 --> 00:31:41.540
It's a king.

00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.920
It's just like ...

00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.320
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Wow.

00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:48.620
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: You can watch
her down a chair with her.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:53.160
You can see, she is a king.

00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.900
She act like that.

00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:57.200
She's like that.

00:31:57.200 --> 00:32:00.500
She's like [inaudible],
she's a female dance.

00:32:00.500 --> 00:32:05.330
She's Master female dance.

00:32:05.330 --> 00:32:11.870
My aunt is female for
Master male role.

00:32:11.870 --> 00:32:16.310
She's both [inaudible],
a love story.

00:32:16.310 --> 00:32:20.540
It just like exactly
like you've just...

00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.840
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Perfect.

00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.430
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: The real thing.

00:32:23.430 --> 00:32:24.730
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: They motivate you

00:32:24.730 --> 00:32:26.120
to do better because
they're so good.

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:27.420
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: The character

00:32:27.420 --> 00:32:29.470
because in traditional
dance, it's a sign language.

00:32:29.470 --> 00:32:36.140
It tells a story, so without
the moves, with the gesture,

00:32:36.140 --> 00:32:41.280
with your finger, your body, it
tells a story so that the audience,

00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.340
if they're watching and they may
not understand Cambodian language

00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:47.330
or what the lyrics is about,

00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.700
but they can tell the
story based on the move.

00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:55.230
So, if that role is supposed
to be a king or a prince,

00:32:55.230 --> 00:33:01.300
and we're doing a scene that we're
going to battle with the giant

00:33:01.300 --> 00:33:05.160
or the soldier is sitting
and waiting for the order,

00:33:05.160 --> 00:33:10.460
if you're the king, when you
demonstrate your power in the shape

00:33:10.460 --> 00:33:15.300
of your body, in your expression,
in your move, it all go together

00:33:15.300 --> 00:33:17.880
to tell a story of
that particular role.

00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.390
So that the audience can see
and say, "I understand what

00:33:21.390 --> 00:33:25.650
that person is doing,
because it demonstrate that,

00:33:25.650 --> 00:33:27.850
that gesture so perfectly."

00:33:27.850 --> 00:33:31.490
So, that's why it takes
years of training,

00:33:31.490 --> 00:33:35.870
so it's like if you do a principal
character, you don't just jump

00:33:35.870 --> 00:33:38.190
and perform the next day.

00:33:38.190 --> 00:33:40.480
It takes training and
preparation from years,

00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.090
and years, and years to be perfect.

00:33:43.090 --> 00:33:45.730
In traditional dance, it's precise.

00:33:45.730 --> 00:33:48.470
Every move tells a story.

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:52.040
Every gesture tells
a story; expression.

00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:57.070
It takes a lot of year of training
and skill to put into that.

00:33:57.070 --> 00:33:58.370
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: That's
why it's hard.

00:33:58.370 --> 00:33:59.670
&gt;&gt; BONAVY CHHIM: Difficult.

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:00.970
It is.

00:34:00.970 --> 00:34:02.270
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Yeah,
to master it.

00:34:02.270 --> 00:34:03.570
Wow. Okay finally, Sovann,
can you explain what it's

00:34:03.570 --> 00:34:05.510
like to learn from your father?

00:34:05.510 --> 00:34:10.040
What's your experience
studying music?

00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:11.340
&gt;&gt; SOVANN CHUM: It's kind of hard,

00:34:11.340 --> 00:34:13.910
because I haven't had
any other teachers.

00:34:13.910 --> 00:34:20.110
Like my father said and all
[inaudible] and Bonavy said, it's,

00:34:20.110 --> 00:34:24.730
a lot of people learn
from a lot of Masters.

00:34:24.730 --> 00:34:27.670
Yes, a lot of the Masters
can play all the instruments,

00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.270
but not all of them can
master one instrument.

00:34:30.270 --> 00:34:34.530
The benefit of me is that my father
can master every single instrument.

00:34:34.530 --> 00:34:38.910
That what makes me great, I
guess, and a passion of it.

00:34:38.910 --> 00:34:41.220
I enjoy going different venues,

00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:43.730
playing different arenas,
different areas.

00:34:43.730 --> 00:34:46.680
I don't have butterflies,
even when I was a little kid.

00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:48.660
It just came so natural to me.

00:34:48.660 --> 00:34:51.450
I just enjoyed it so much.

00:34:51.450 --> 00:34:52.750
It's very great.

00:34:52.750 --> 00:34:54.970
It's an honor to actually learn
from someone who knows how

00:34:54.970 --> 00:34:59.580
to play every instrument and
actually master every instrument.

00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:01.750 position:56%
So, I guess I consider myself lucky.

00:35:01.750 --> 00:35:03.050
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Yeah,
I would think so.

00:35:03.050 --> 00:35:04.350
&gt;&gt; SOVANN CHUM: Very lucky.

00:35:04.350 --> 00:35:05.650
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Very lucky.

00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:06.950
&gt;&gt; SOVANN CHUM: I listen to
other Master teachers play

00:35:06.950 --> 00:35:12.180
and they actually want
to learn from me.

00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.450
They actually want
to learn how I do it.

00:35:14.450 --> 00:35:16.810
To hear from other
Master teachers...

00:35:16.810 --> 00:35:20.310
because the way we play music
is not any other culture,

00:35:20.310 --> 00:35:22.850
any other way because
they play with notes.

00:35:22.850 --> 00:35:25.630
Us, it's all by memorizing
everything.

00:35:25.630 --> 00:35:28.490
That's the hardest part.

00:35:28.490 --> 00:35:31.560
Every teacher has a different
way of playing, their way.

00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.030
My father have a unique
way of playing his style.

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.290
Everyone loves and learns from
him, listens to his CDs and stuff.

00:35:40.290 --> 00:35:45.280
The benefit of me is, I cannot play
music for a year or two, come back

00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:48.390
and it's right there again.

00:35:48.390 --> 00:35:52.720
I guess, it is a great opportunity
and I'm very fortunate and lucky

00:35:52.720 --> 00:35:55.020
to have him as a teacher.

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:57.380
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: It's very nice.

00:35:57.380 --> 00:35:58.680
Thank you-

00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.980
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: I
just wanted to add-

00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:01.280
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Add something.

00:36:01.280 --> 00:36:02.580
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: -one more ...

00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:04.820
I have to thanks to, I think
she passed away already.

00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:13.790
That's a long time with Pol Pot,
so I just let them know that thanks

00:36:13.790 --> 00:36:19.760
to her that's teach me how to dance
and now I came to United States,

00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.290
build a group and [inaudible],
[inaudible], [inaudible].

00:36:22.290 --> 00:36:24.490 position:56%
I was taught, I was the [inaudible].

00:36:24.490 --> 00:36:32.760
I came to United States,
I'm the taller one,

00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:38.990
so then become male role.

00:36:38.990 --> 00:36:44.830
I can dance both male
role and female role.

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.130
[inaudible], [inaudible],
[inaudible], [inaudible] ...

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.430
[inaudible].

00:36:47.430 --> 00:36:48.730
A lot of [inaudible].

00:36:48.730 --> 00:36:55.880
So, thank you that's
she been taught us.

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.250
I have ...

00:36:57.250 --> 00:37:20.510
all kind came into pass
around to this generation.

00:37:26.170 --> 00:37:27.470
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: In
the United States.

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:28.770
It's wonderful.

00:37:28.770 --> 00:37:30.070
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Thank you so much.

00:37:30.070 --> 00:37:31.370
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Thank you.

00:37:31.370 --> 00:37:32.670
&gt;&gt; SOVANN CHUM: Same here.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:33.970
I would like to thank my
grandfather, my great-grandfather,

00:37:33.970 --> 00:37:35.520
absolutely that taught
my father everything.

00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:38.700 position:56%
I guess without my great-grandfather
teaching my father,

00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:43.110
things would have been probably
different, during the Khmer Rouge.

00:37:43.110 --> 00:37:47.960
He survived a lot because of the
ability to play music, coming here,

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:50.030
the awards that he have won.

00:37:50.030 --> 00:37:54.100
I would definitely like to thank
my great-grandfather for passing

00:37:54.100 --> 00:38:00.140 position:56%
down that tradition, the arts,
making everyone a better person here

00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:04.790
to preserve the culture that's
been lost during the war.

00:38:04.790 --> 00:38:08.450
So, I would like to thank all
the teachers that passed away

00:38:08.450 --> 00:38:12.070
and everyone that tried
to keep this alive.

00:38:12.070 --> 00:38:14.370
It's very important.

00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:17.700
&gt;&gt; JOANNA PECORE: Thank
you everybody.

00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:19.000
&gt;&gt; SAM-OUEN TES: Okay, that's all.

00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:20.310

you beautiful performance today.
