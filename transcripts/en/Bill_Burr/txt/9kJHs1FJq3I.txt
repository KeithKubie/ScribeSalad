Speaker 2:          00:02          all right. I got behind this dump truck, but this is one of my favorite things on the road as far as, uh, one of the best skylines you can ever see. I mean, uh, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, you go through this town and you're like, oh, I, this looks like, you know, shit all fucking titled Smells like exhaust in here. And uh, when you come through the other tunnel though, I'll show you the view here. This is where you, people can't either, you don't travel, but you know, vacations in Pittsburgh, right? Let's be honest, I didn't realize this tunnel was this fucking long. I'm running under shift the SEC. This is like when there's like a rain delay, they go back to two fucking greenhorn announcers. They run out of stories all day. They already had a hot done here these days. What time? Well, you know, I was in the middle of telling a story and yeah, I guess I went to inhale as I was swallowing in shelter.

Speaker 2:          01:02          Shut up fucking whore. I know what to do. All right, so here we go. Well, come on out. I see daylight, I see things. All right, so you coming through here, you're like, whatever. Pittsburgh gives a flock, right? The hockey team with all that cheap shot artists and that crybaby players, um, Kabaka with you. I respect him and all of a sudden you come out of the tunnel and Bam, you're going to ask, when you see that, look at that. There's hides field over there where the fucking steel lattice would they play? Can you see it? There's a fucking guardrails in the way. I think it's supposed to make a left yet. Two 79 north. Okay, sweetheart. We've got all the bridges. Ah, exit 70 p four 40 mention center. You know, you're really fucked up this video. Anyways, that's one of my favorite things in the road. Okay, bye.
