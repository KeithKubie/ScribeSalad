00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Of course, the answer is yes.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
That's an interesting phenomenon.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
You placed a random bet. You had a third chance.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Monty would lift another curtain and it feels like he's giving you absolutely no information,

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
because you know such a curtain exists.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.000
He just shows you the obvious.

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Yet in doing so you will always switch--every single time.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
You won't even think. You'll blindly switch to the remaining curtain.

00:00:24.000 --> 99:59:59.000
By doing this, you'll double your chances of winning. Why is this so?
