00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.640
- Do you know what the Egyptians
do with lying,

00:00:01.668 --> 00:00:03.136
worthless terrorists, Michael?

00:00:03.169 --> 00:00:04.337
MICHAEL: I don't understand.

00:00:04.370 --> 00:00:05.805
I gave you what you wanted.

00:00:05.838 --> 00:00:07.407
Headquarters took
me off your case file,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.142
and they're closing
your account.

00:00:09.175 --> 00:00:11.377
They don't think that you know
anything about the prince.

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:13.546
Unless you can give me something
that proves that you were

00:00:13.579 --> 00:00:16.115
close with him, something
that leads us to him,

00:00:16.148 --> 00:00:17.483
you're on that plane.

00:00:17.516 --> 00:00:20.286
Emir Al-Muttaqi introduced me.

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:21.788
MAN: How's it looking, Doc?

00:00:21.821 --> 00:00:24.424
DOCTOR: Rehab should take
three months, maybe longer.

00:00:24.457 --> 00:00:26.559
After rehab, you
should regain full use

00:00:26.592 --> 00:00:28.261
of your wrist and your hand.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:29.695
It's not that bad, really.

00:00:29.728 --> 00:00:31.664
You know, oxy will
help speed things up.

00:00:31.697 --> 00:00:34.167
Maybe a little Demerol, Vicodin.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.535
Fentanyl.
Fentanyl's good.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:36.569
Advil.

00:00:36.602 --> 00:00:38.237
As I said, it's not that bad.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:40.306
I need to show you something.

00:00:40.339 --> 00:00:43.142
Bomb's gonna go off right here.

00:00:43.175 --> 00:00:46.846
All these people, I
just see them dead.

00:00:46.879 --> 00:00:49.715
If I wasn't thinking
about my job all the time,

00:00:49.748 --> 00:00:52.085
how many more people like
this would be dead right now?

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.791
GINA: Tell me about that day,
the day you met Shishoni.

00:00:58.824 --> 00:01:00.326
SHISHONI: Do you
know why you're here?

00:01:00.359 --> 00:01:02.128
Muttaqi keeps talking about you.

00:01:02.161 --> 00:01:05.531
As American, you'd be a
great asset to the cause.

00:01:05.564 --> 00:01:08.868
Since when has an American not
betrayed those who trusted him?

00:01:08.901 --> 00:01:10.803
I should kill you
where you stand.

00:01:10.836 --> 00:01:12.271
GINA: Why didn't
the prince kill you?

00:01:12.304 --> 00:01:14.707
MICHAEL: I gave him
something he needed.

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.210
We need a renewed vision.

00:01:17.243 --> 00:01:22.682
We need to step into the
future, undermine their heroes,

00:01:22.715 --> 00:01:25.885
and build up our own.

00:01:25.918 --> 00:01:29.755
Where did you
find this genius?

00:01:29.788 --> 00:01:32.892
I killed a boy in Fallujah
the day that Sarah died.

00:01:32.925 --> 00:01:37.697
I think that Sarah's
death was God's punishment

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:39.632
for me killing that boy.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.503
I-- I just can't get
it out of my head.

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:45.905
You know what I can't
get out of my head?

00:01:45.938 --> 00:01:50.643
Her tiny dead body in my arms.

00:01:50.676 --> 00:01:54.480
You think her death
is because of you?

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:59.385
Everything is about you,
always is, always will be.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:07.193
Jade, for my cousin here.

00:02:07.226 --> 00:02:09.395
He is a big hero.

00:02:09.428 --> 00:02:12.331
[inaudible] texted me.
All right?

00:02:12.364 --> 00:02:13.266
She's worried about you.

00:02:13.299 --> 00:02:14.667
We got to get you home.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.936
I had a [muted] day in the ER.

00:02:16.969 --> 00:02:18.871
Kid died.

00:02:18.904 --> 00:02:23.476
I just-- I want a minute, OK?

00:02:23.509 --> 00:02:24.877
Have one drink with me, huh?

00:02:24.910 --> 00:02:25.812
One drink, then we go.

00:02:37.590 --> 00:02:38.491
[inaudible].

00:02:38.524 --> 00:02:39.825
Come on, you're drunk.

00:02:39.858 --> 00:02:40.827
Get off of me.

00:02:44.463 --> 00:02:48.834
[non-english speech] You OK?

00:02:48.867 --> 00:02:53.839
[both laughing]

00:02:53.872 --> 00:02:57.910
I've seen too many
people die, man.

00:02:57.943 --> 00:02:58.945
Something we have in common.

00:02:58.978 --> 00:02:59.712
Yeah.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:01.314
Come on.

00:03:01.347 --> 00:03:03.416
Except I'm the one
trying to save their lives.

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:06.686
The anger that you feel,
that was put in your heart

00:03:06.719 --> 00:03:08.588
to give you the
strength that you need

00:03:08.621 --> 00:03:10.323
for the war that is to come.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:14.327
And that victory will come
with the help of a single word.

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:17.597
And that word is vision.

00:03:17.630 --> 00:03:18.664
GINA: So that's it?

00:03:18.697 --> 00:03:20.266
That's all you got for me?

00:03:20.299 --> 00:03:22.668
Some bull [muted] sermon
you gave him the idea for?

00:03:22.701 --> 00:03:24.837
This is it.

00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:28.608
This is the last conversation
you'll ever have.

00:03:28.641 --> 00:03:30.676
What do you want me to say?

00:03:30.709 --> 00:03:32.745
- I want the truth.
- You're OK.

00:03:32.778 --> 00:03:33.613
You're fine.

00:03:36.882 --> 00:03:37.984
I got you.

00:03:38.017 --> 00:03:39.885
Hey, you're OK.
You're all right.

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:41.354
Go away.
Please go away.

00:03:41.387 --> 00:03:42.455
What's going on in here?

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:43.623
- He fell.
- Go away.

00:03:43.656 --> 00:03:45.258
Go away.
Go away.

00:03:49.061 --> 00:03:56.869
[moaning]

00:03:56.902 --> 00:03:59.472
I've missed you.
How have you been?

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:04.277
Never better.

00:04:07.646 --> 00:04:10.983
I can't tell if that's a
total lie or the truest thing

00:04:11.016 --> 00:04:12.752
you've ever said to me.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:14.854
MAN: Suddenly, the M1A1 has
had enough, fires back at him.

00:04:14.887 --> 00:04:16.656
Boom!
Right?

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:18.924
The blast throws the due in the
air, incinerates his clothes,

00:04:18.957 --> 00:04:20.760
splits him in two, right?

00:04:20.793 --> 00:04:24.397
Now, when he lands, the bottom
half lands ass up, all right?

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:28.634
But the top half, his face--

00:04:28.667 --> 00:04:31.637
guess you had to be there.

00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:32.938
That's your plane.

00:04:32.971 --> 00:04:34.340
Last chance, Michael.

00:04:34.373 --> 00:04:35.474
Think hard.

00:04:35.507 --> 00:04:37.677
I can prove it.

00:04:37.710 --> 00:04:40.546
There's another grave on
the edge of the field.

00:04:44.049 --> 00:04:48.087
You'll find a body
in it, a young boy.

00:04:48.120 --> 00:04:53.759
I needed to see how far you're
willing to go for the cause,

00:04:53.792 --> 00:04:55.361
for me.

00:04:55.394 --> 00:04:58.364
But remember what happens
to those who betray me.

00:04:58.397 --> 00:04:59.098
[gunfire]

00:04:59.131 --> 00:05:00.700
Jesus.

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.501
WOMAN: Andrew Hall was
kidnapped eight hours ago.

00:05:02.534 --> 00:05:03.803
The president's Andrew Hall?

00:05:03.836 --> 00:05:05.371
Yes, and two of his aides.

00:05:05.404 --> 00:05:06.839
It's part of the [inaudible]
movement led by--

00:05:06.872 --> 00:05:08.841
Yeah, the prince.

00:05:08.874 --> 00:05:10.109
Stay on him.

00:05:10.142 --> 00:05:11.577
He's got to know more
about the prince's

00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:13.713
network, anything
that will help us

00:05:13.746 --> 00:05:15.781
find out where he's taken Hall.

00:05:15.814 --> 00:05:18.050
GINA: Good news is you're
not going to Egypt.

00:05:18.083 --> 00:05:19.018
What's the bad news?

00:05:22.588 --> 00:05:24.957
We're still working together.

00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:29.862
You were never going to
fly me to Egypt, were you?

00:05:29.895 --> 00:05:31.731
Were you?

00:05:31.764 --> 00:05:36.869
I need a gun to protect the
kids when you're not around.

00:05:36.902 --> 00:05:38.804
Guns are my other life.

00:05:38.837 --> 00:05:39.739
We're safe, Juanita.

00:05:42.641 --> 00:05:45.845
I promise.
WOMAN: Really?

00:05:45.878 --> 00:05:46.913
[music playing]

00:05:52.117 --> 00:05:53.886
[gunshot]
