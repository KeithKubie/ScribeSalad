00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:01.359
Now that you've learned a little bit about ALDH2,

00:00:01.359 --> 00:00:04.830
let's see if we can put this information together with

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.300
some of the concepts about ancestry and inheritance, that have

00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:11.960
shown up in previous lessons. Meet Dave, a fictional character

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.370
with an East Asian background. This is a pedigree

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.100
of Dave and his family For the trait of Alcohol

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:20.440
Flush Reaction. Now, you can see in this pedigree, Dave

00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:25.450
has an affected mother, uncle, maternal grandparents, lots of extended

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.840
family that are affected. Now, for this

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.740
pedigree, the a allele for ALDH2 is dominant,

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.340
and that's what leads to the alcohol flush

00:00:33.340 --> 00:00:36.530
reaction. The G allele, is recessive where we

00:00:36.530 --> 00:00:39.330
don't see alcohol flush. Now a dominant

00:00:39.330 --> 00:00:43.730
loss of function allele, means that, heterozygous individuals

00:00:43.730 --> 00:00:47.430
will actually be affected. But the homozygous phenotype,

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.640
is even more severe. In fact, its so

00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:54.170
severe that some individuals avoid drinking altogether

00:00:54.170 --> 00:00:56.090
because they feel so sick. So if

00:00:56.090 --> 00:01:02.670
Dave's mother is homozygous for the A allele. Then how may of her children will

00:01:02.670 --> 00:01:08.550
exhibit at least some alcohol flush reaction? There are three children total.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:14.440
Do you think it would be none of the children? 1, 2, 3, or all of the children?
