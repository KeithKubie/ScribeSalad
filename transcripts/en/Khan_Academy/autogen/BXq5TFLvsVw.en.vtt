00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:07.310
 In this video we will talk about boxplot charts. 

00:00:07.310 --> 00:00:12.090
 Boxplots are used quite frequently. 

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:16.460
 Particularly within stock analysis and statistics. 

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:17.320
 . 

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.650
 Most stock charters 

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.070
 have boxplots in their sortiement. 

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.000
 First, however, we need to understand how to do it 

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:31.140
 and reading a box plot using 

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:32.530
 of these data. 

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.380
 First, we must put them in order, 

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:37.270
 We do this as we have to find some medians 

00:00:37.270 --> 00:00:39.150
 to make our box plot. 

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:42.190
 Let's put the numbers in order. 

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.860
 It seems that 49 is the lowest number. 

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.820
 In addition, we have an additional 2 49. 

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:58.240
 They thus constitute the first 3 numbers in the number sequence. 

00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.860
 Now let's see if we have some 50s? 

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:02.460
 We have it - 50 is available twice. 

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:04.129
 1, a total of 2 50s. 

00:01:04.129 --> 00:01:06.310
 . 

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.950
 . 

00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.060
 Do we have some 51s? 

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:12.300
 As far as I can see, 51 is only 1 time. 

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.470
 51 is there once. 

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.980
 Do we have some 52? 

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.980
 We have a 52. 

00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:19.950
 . 

00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:20.840
 Some 53? 

00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:24.500
 We have 1, 2 53s. 

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:27.620
 53 and 53. 

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:30.600
 Here is a 54. 

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.380
 There are no more of them. 

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.860
 There are no 55's, 

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:42.920
 but here is a 56. 

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:46.050
 There is
