00:00:36.955 --> 00:00:39.965
It's actually quite to easy to tell when someone has fallen in love with you.

00:00:39.965 --> 00:00:43.035
But due to our tendency in human history to complicate things

00:00:43.035 --> 00:00:46.015
by overthinking, we may not believe it at first.

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:49.095
Thanks to hook up culture, men especially,

00:00:49.095 --> 00:00:52.095
have a bad rep for being non committed players

00:00:52.095 --> 00:00:54.885
But this doesn't make anyone immune to catching feelings.

00:00:54.885 --> 00:00:57.995
Are you wondering if someone is beginning to fall for you?

00:00:57.995 --> 00:00:59.945
Here are 6 clear signs he's in love with you.

00:01:00.465 --> 00:01:03.285
Number 1, he enjoys poking fun at you

00:01:03.285 --> 00:01:06.375
on a regular basis. Although teasing is a common form of flirting

00:01:06.375 --> 00:01:09.345
in the initial stages of dating, over time

00:01:09.345 --> 00:01:12.425
when they get to know and fall in love with you,

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:15.395
they start to come up with inside jokes only you understand

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:16.395
that makes it more exclusive and special

00:01:16.915 --> 00:01:20.075
People in love tend to be more in tune with their playful youthfulness

00:01:20.075 --> 00:01:23.315
It's important to be able to laugh with your partner so you can

00:01:23.315 --> 00:01:25.265
handle all life's curveballs thrown your way

00:01:25.695 --> 00:01:28.535
Number 2, he opens up about things that are

00:01:28.535 --> 00:01:31.685
hard to talk about. This is especially true if

00:01:31.685 --> 00:01:34.735
your partner is more shy or reserved. When someone

00:01:34.735 --> 00:01:37.765
is slow to open up and selective about who he lets in,

00:01:37.765 --> 00:01:40.625
pay attention to what he reveals to you. Does he share

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:43.655
embarrassing stories or things that are hard to talk about?

00:01:43.655 --> 00:01:46.315
If he lets his guard down and shows his vulnerable side

00:01:46.315 --> 00:01:49.125
it means you are becoming someone he can trust and depend on

00:01:49.675 --> 00:01:52.585
Number 3, he pays attention to details about you.

00:01:52.585 --> 00:01:55.085
It's common for people to remember things about you

00:01:55.085 --> 00:01:57.965
when they are initially trying to impress you

00:01:57.965 --> 00:02:00.735
But when they are in love, it goes deeper than that

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:03.795
People in love pay attention to the details. Big or small,

00:02:03.795 --> 00:02:06.625
because they genuinely find you interesting and enjoy

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:09.055
learning everything about you. If you think your partner is

00:02:09.055 --> 00:02:11.765
beginning to know you better than you know yourself

00:02:11.815 --> 00:02:14.005
There's a pretty good chance he's falling for you

00:02:14.465 --> 00:02:17.295
Number 4, he becomes more open minded

00:02:17.295 --> 00:02:19.075
about trying the things you like

00:02:19.705 --> 00:02:22.825
Whether it means going to a restaurant you've been dying to visit

00:02:22.825 --> 00:02:25.775
or trying something as bold and dramatic as skydiving

00:02:25.825 --> 00:02:28.595
People in love are willing to step out of their comfort zones

00:02:28.595 --> 00:02:31.485
to make unique memories with you. Even if he's not always

00:02:31.485 --> 00:02:34.525
a fan of the things he tries because of you,

00:02:34.525 --> 00:02:37.365
just being open minded about your interests and hobbies is a clear sign

00:02:37.365 --> 00:02:40.415
he cares enough about you to support them.

00:02:40.415 --> 00:02:42.445
When someone is in love, the last thing they will do is be

00:02:42.445 --> 00:02:45.315
dismissive or judgmental towards you so don't worry about embracing

00:02:45.315 --> 00:02:46.555
your true self.

00:02:47.155 --> 00:02:50.165
Number 5, he's protective of you and

00:02:50.165 --> 00:02:53.375
helps you get through your bad days. It's easy to love someone at their best

00:02:53.375 --> 00:02:56.335
but the ultimate test of love is being able to accept one another

00:02:56.335 --> 00:02:58.615
at each other's worst.

00:02:58.615 --> 00:03:01.735
In relationships, you are challenged to become a better person.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:04.675
When someone is willing to help you get through your bad days,

00:03:04.675 --> 00:03:07.595
not only is it a sign of maturity, but it shows

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:10.435
that you have a stable relationship built on trust,

00:03:10.435 --> 00:03:13.185
compassion and understanding. If he sees the potential

00:03:13.185 --> 00:03:15.435
in the two of you being long term,

00:03:15.435 --> 00:03:17.635
then he will continue to work on making that happen.

00:03:18.555 --> 00:03:19.555
Number 6,

00:03:19.905 --> 00:03:22.715
he's at ease around you and doesn't

00:03:22.715 --> 00:03:25.585
feel pressured to change. We are rarely ever our true selves

00:03:25.585 --> 00:03:28.555
when we are dating someone in the first few months

00:03:28.555 --> 00:03:31.695
It kind of feels like a prolonged interview. But when you are in love,

00:03:31.725 --> 00:03:34.755
dating stops feeling like a performance and more like home.

00:03:34.755 --> 00:03:37.785
You will notice that he will stop feeling self-conscious

00:03:37.785 --> 00:03:40.975
about himself. Whether that means having bad hair in the morning

00:03:40.975 --> 00:03:44.025
or just dancing in front of you. When the walls start coming down

00:03:44.025 --> 00:03:47.335
that's when you know, you've truly reached his heart

00:03:47.965 --> 00:03:50.465
Do you agree with these signs?
