00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:05.720
Coravin Wine Access technology uses a hollow
needle to extract wine so you never have to

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.570
remove the cork again.

00:00:07.570 --> 00:00:13.269
And for twenty four years there was secret
troll under the San Francisco Bay Bridge that

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:19.140
was only seen by bridge workers and boaters
and a new troll will be hidden somewhere on

00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.349
the new bridge.

00:00:20.349 --> 00:00:25.840
Vsauce, Kevin here this is Mind Blow.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:32.980
The Nasal Ranger is a field olfactometer that
measures odor strength.

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.090
If you follow me on Twitter I shared this
a few days ago.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.800
It takes out the subjectivity of smell and
provides a universal odor strength standard

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.510
using the dilution to threshold method.

00:00:43.510 --> 00:00:48.470
This is the most commonly used and recognized
method of odor scale and is determined by

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:52.870
the number of dilutions needed to take the
odor out of the air.

00:00:52.870 --> 00:00:59.040
Sono is a device concept that cancels sounds
from the outside when attached to the window.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:03.320
Designed by Rudolf Stefanich, it was nominated
for the James Dyson Award and claims that

00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.360
rooms with the device are 10 times quieter
than rooms without it.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:09.870
It allows the user several filtering options.

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:17.500
To have complete silence, only filter certain
noises so you can keep the sound of birds

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:23.120
chirping in and keep the construction sounds
out, or simply change noises to something

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.120
that you enjoy.

00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:26.890
But the device is not yet ready for production.

00:01:26.890 --> 00:01:31.050
The deep green is underwater renewable energy
technology.

00:01:31.050 --> 00:01:35.690
Created by Minesto, and now in practical use
in the waters off the coast of Northern Ireland,

00:01:35.690 --> 00:01:40.010
it converts energy from tidal stream flows
into electricity.

00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.320
This system is valuable because tidal currents
are highly predictable and there's minimal

00:01:44.320 --> 00:01:49.440
visual impact because it's always at least
20 meters below the surface of the water.

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:56.530
This catalogue of 1500 criminal mugshots recently
sold at auction for $10,000!

00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:02.420
Researchers at Simon Fraser University have
created robots that pays attention to humans.

00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.640
Using cameras and facial detection the drones
are able to see who the human is looking at

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:12.240
and specific voice commands tell them what
to do once they know which one of them is

00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:13.549
being directed.

00:02:13.549 --> 00:02:17.760
All of this effort is being made to develop
a command system that even an inexperienced

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:20.099
user can easily pick up on.

00:02:20.099 --> 00:02:24.879
The Hairlytop Interface is an interactive
display that could be used as life-like fur

00:02:24.879 --> 00:02:27.489
for robotic pets and toys.

00:02:27.489 --> 00:02:32.410
It reacts to the changes in light and brightness
of the screen creating movement similar to

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:37.450
that of a living thing and they hope to one
day create an entire floor that moves along

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.159
with changes in light.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:44.040
The device is primarily used with light but
can also be controlled with audio and magnetic

00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.040
sensors.

00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:50.349
3D printed human cells could possibly do away
with the need for drug testing on animals

00:02:50.349 --> 00:02:52.739
within the next five years.

00:02:52.739 --> 00:02:58.170
Bioengineering PhD student Alan Fauklkner-Jones
claims that the new technology can print human

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:03.510
stem cells to create micro tissues and micro
organs to test drugs on.

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:09.279
The technology could also allow for drug tests
to be personalized by using cells of the specific

00:03:09.279 --> 00:03:12.099
patient instead of a generic human response.

00:03:12.099 --> 00:03:15.910
Shreddies are underwear that were designed
to stop farts from smelling.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.340
So Yeah.

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:22.919
inFORM is a Dynamic Shape Display that lets
users interact with digital information.

00:03:22.919 --> 00:03:28.799
For example architects can better present
their designs from afar using 3D renderings.

00:03:28.799 --> 00:03:33.129
Developed at MIT, inFORM can interact with
the physical world, seen here moving around

00:03:33.129 --> 00:03:35.330
this ball and picking it up with a basket.

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:39.969
And they're looking to explore ways to use
this in areas ranging from surgical simulations

00:03:39.969 --> 00:03:41.879
to urban planning.

00:03:41.879 --> 00:03:47.359
The light cloth is an interactive light display
of woven fabric made out of optic fibers that

00:03:47.359 --> 00:03:50.760
allows for computer controlled light patterns
to be displayed.

00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:56.430
The light cloth is also able to receive signals
using infrared light such as a pen or laser

00:03:56.430 --> 00:04:02.010
pointer so you could even change the color
of someone's clothes on a stage from a distance.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:07.139
This sign language ring won a prestigious
red dot award for 2013.

00:04:07.139 --> 00:04:11.909
Using a set of rings and a bracelet the system
is able to detect sign language motions and

00:04:11.909 --> 00:04:15.900
translate them to voice that is emitted by
the bracelet.

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:20.440
The system is able to be customized to the
particular user by prerecording their signing

00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:23.000
movements and assigning the appropriate words.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:27.979
Finally, here' the first performance ever
of the Viola Organista an instrument originally

00:04:27.979 --> 00:04:29.540
designed by Leonardo DaVinci.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:44.669
I'm going to 

00:04:44.669 --> 00:04:50.879
leave you with a robot playing rock paper
scissors that never loses and as always - thanks

00:04:50.879 --> 00:05:45.259
for watching.
