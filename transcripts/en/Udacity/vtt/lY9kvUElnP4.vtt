Okay, let's get the answer. Lauren, how are we

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:06.020
going to get your sequence close to my tata box?

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:07.000
&gt;&gt; Matt, I'm right here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:07.540
&gt;&gt; Oh.

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:08.150
&gt;&gt; No need to yell.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:10.790
&gt;&gt; Actually, that works great. Remember, even though DNA

00:00:10.790 --> 00:00:14.610
is really long and thin, it makes it really flexible,

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:17.180
so that all DNA has to do is fold up

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:20.350
and bring sequences really far away to sequences that matter.
