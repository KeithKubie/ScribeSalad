ADAM LEONARD: Welcome, everyone.

00:00:03.960 --> 00:00:05.970
Thank you for coming today.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:08.850
Hello to everyone live
in the room with me.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.410
And we have people
participating in the livestream

00:00:11.410 --> 00:00:12.710
from all over the world.

00:00:12.710 --> 00:00:16.014
And also hello to those of
you who will be seeing us

00:00:16.014 --> 00:00:19.220
on YouTube after the fact.

00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:23.720
So my name is Adam Leonard
from the People Development

00:00:23.720 --> 00:00:25.606
Department.

00:00:25.606 --> 00:00:28.346
And I'm really
excited about today.

00:00:28.346 --> 00:00:31.740
It's been in conversation
for many months

00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:33.960
for several different reasons.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:41.550
So one is that our speaker
today is a scientist,

00:00:41.550 --> 00:00:43.790
and I have great
respect for him.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:47.392
He has a Ph.D. in
mathematics-- let's see,

00:00:47.392 --> 00:00:49.600
I want to get this right--
studying the singularities

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.556
in gravitational systems.

00:00:51.556 --> 00:00:53.930
And so I know there's a lot
of scientists here at Google,

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:57.549
but oftentimes what
can happen-- I'm not

00:00:57.549 --> 00:00:59.590
a scientist by training,
but whatever work we do,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:02.820
we can be so heads
down, so busy that we

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:06.330
lose sight of what was that
initial inspiration that

00:01:06.330 --> 00:01:08.745
attracted us to whatever
we ended up studying

00:01:08.745 --> 00:01:10.870
in the first place, whether
it was computer science

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:12.310
or what have you.

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:14.280
And so what I love
so much about Brian

00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:19.280
and his work is that, in my own
experience, he's brought back,

00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:22.140
you can call it the
wonder, the awe,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:29.310
the heart in science, and in
cosmology, and the universe,

00:01:29.310 --> 00:01:32.800
and this sense that
we had of the mystery

00:01:32.800 --> 00:01:34.840
that we find ourselves
in since childhood.

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:37.820
That can sometimes
get lost over time.

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:42.290
And so by bringing in a
kind of poetry to science,

00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:44.720
it's quite a gift,
and it's quite unique.

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.540
And so I think you'll be able
to experience at least a taste

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.180
of that today along with me.

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.430
So thank you for coming, and
I'm going to hand it over

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:53.721
to Brian Swimme.

00:01:53.721 --> 00:01:56.710
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:56.710 --> 00:02:00.270
BRIAN SWIMME: It's great
to be with you today.

00:02:00.270 --> 00:02:02.360
I like the way Adam
described my work.

00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:07.430
It's a way of remembering
the wonder of the universe.

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.230
Another way to talk
about it is to say

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:20.560
that it could be that the human
species is going through one

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.850
of its fundamental
changes, and we're

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:24.170
right in the middle of it.

00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:28.420
I mean, this has
happened before.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.640
We talk about the Paleolithic
era, the Neolithic era,

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.430
the classical civilizations,
and the modern period.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:40.020
And so it could
be that we're just

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:44.810
on the cusp of entering
another era of humanity.

00:02:48.652 --> 00:02:50.760
And I don't claim to
know this with certainty

00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:54.140
at all, because we're
right in the middle of it.

00:02:54.140 --> 00:03:01.140
But nevertheless, I think
it's a hopeful vision

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:06.650
that we're moving out of
one era and into another.

00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:10.400
And so I'm really here to talk
about that as a possibility,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.940
something to reflect on.

00:03:11.940 --> 00:03:16.180
Is it the case that
we're wobbling forward

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:22.300
into a new era of
the human adventure?

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:27.250
One way to say it
is that the cultures

00:03:27.250 --> 00:03:31.440
have a fundamental story, a
fundamental way of orienting

00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:32.720
themselves to the universe.

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:35.560
I mean, every culture
that we've looked at

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.880
has this kind of overview.

00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:42.950
It's a way in which
we can gather together

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:47.610
human energies to focus on
what we think is important.

00:03:47.610 --> 00:03:52.030
And the basic idea
to repeat is that I

00:03:52.030 --> 00:03:56.280
think the orientation
during the modern period

00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.140
is not as convincing
as it once was.

00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:05.590
Something else
might be emerging.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:10.830
And if I can tell you just in
a phrase what I think that is.

00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:14.640
I think it is the case
that for the first time

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:19.410
in human history, we
are seeing the emergence

00:04:19.410 --> 00:04:23.310
of a fundamental story
of the universe that

00:04:23.310 --> 00:04:27.490
draws upon the
experience of humans

00:04:27.490 --> 00:04:30.820
from every continent,
every culture.

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:34.120
It's not the only
thing that's emerging.

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.990
I'm not saying that, but I'm
saying that it's remarkable

00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:42.340
that during the last 400 years
of modern science, scientists

00:04:42.340 --> 00:04:45.570
working in different fields
entirely-- engineers,

00:04:45.570 --> 00:04:48.950
technologists, scientists--
different fields have

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:53.330
eventuated with a story
that is comprehensive

00:04:53.330 --> 00:04:56.770
concerning the birth of
universe and its development.

00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:02.630
I mean, I myself first noticed
this in graduate school.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.560
So there we were at
night, and talking

00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.250
about the evolution
of the stars,

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:12.160
or the birth of the Earth.

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:16.910
And we all were speaking
about the same story.

00:05:16.910 --> 00:05:18.940
One of my friends
was from China,

00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.910
another was from Afghanistan,
another was from Bolivia.

00:05:22.910 --> 00:05:26.690
All of our different
backgrounds, and yet we

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:31.055
agreed on these
fundamental perspectives.

00:05:33.746 --> 00:05:41.550
So that is this
notion that perhaps,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:45.100
even in the middle of a
very difficult situation

00:05:45.100 --> 00:05:47.840
on the planet, with
war taking place

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.350
and all kinds of violence,
even in the midst of this,

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:57.880
there appears the possibility
of an understanding that

00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:03.300
has at least the promise of
deepening the unity that humans

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.540
feel with one another.

00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:16.320
One way to enter
into this discussion

00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:20.180
was to think about the last time
something like this happened.

00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:23.980
And that was with Copernicus.

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:27.330
So Copernicus with his
great discovery of the Earth

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:31.240
actually moving around
the sun, I mean,

00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:36.550
that was a huge insight
into the universe.

00:06:36.550 --> 00:06:41.420
And it took centuries
for to really take hold.

00:06:41.420 --> 00:06:44.570
And I think something
similar is taking place here.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:49.780
And if you can imagine
it's the year 1542, which

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:52.760
is just the year
before Copernicus died,

00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.870
he was very reluctant to
talk about his findings.

00:06:56.870 --> 00:06:58.440
But just imagine
that he took a trip

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.050
to London, the
center of the world,

00:07:00.050 --> 00:07:05.130
and he wanted to talk about
this new fundamental story that

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:06.280
was emerging.

00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:09.730
And what kind of a
reception would he get?

00:07:09.730 --> 00:07:11.610
He wouldn't get
much of anything.

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:16.830
One of the difficulties
is, the ongoing challenge

00:07:16.830 --> 00:07:20.430
of just survival in
London, in England,

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:25.450
actually, in 1542, the
population of England

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.000
had been going downhill
for three centuries.

00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.060
The plague had taken out
a good number of people,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:34.980
but also there was
scurvy, there was measles,

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:37.330
there was tuberculosis.

00:07:37.330 --> 00:07:41.510
So England was on the way
out, and the last thing

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:43.070
in the world they
want to listen to

00:07:43.070 --> 00:07:46.965
is a guy talking about
the sun and the Earth.

00:07:46.965 --> 00:07:48.680
They had more pressing things.

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:51.920
And I think that's similar
to our situation now.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.390
We have so many pressing issues.

00:07:55.390 --> 00:07:57.260
But there's another reason.

00:07:57.260 --> 00:08:00.730
Another reason that a new
story is difficult to take in

00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:07.010
is because it's fundamentally
counterintuitive to the default

00:08:07.010 --> 00:08:10.940
assumptions of the culture,
fundamentally counterintuitive.

00:08:10.940 --> 00:08:12.561
You can imagine.

00:08:12.561 --> 00:08:13.310
Here's Copernicus.

00:08:13.310 --> 00:08:15.750
He's talking to Londoners,
and he's telling them,

00:08:15.750 --> 00:08:21.430
it turns out that the sun
isn't going around the Earth.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.650
The Earth is actually spinning.

00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:26.520
Well, this goes against
what everyone had assumed

00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.030
was the case, almost everyone
had assumed was the case.

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:34.350
And right away, there are
intellectual objections.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:39.340
So for instance, if the
Earth is actually spinning,

00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:42.700
they would say to him, then
why isn't the Atlantic Ocean

00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:45.860
washing over the island?

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:49.580
So the science of the
time would be at odds

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.610
with what Copernicus was saying.

00:08:52.610 --> 00:08:57.100
And the same is
true of this story

00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:00.250
that science and technology
are bringing to us.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:07.770
There are three fundamentally
counterintuitive aspects

00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.880
to the new story that
make it difficult

00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:15.690
for it to be drawn into
the society as a whole.

00:09:20.090 --> 00:09:24.010
The first is the notion that
the universe is expanding.

00:09:24.010 --> 00:09:27.940
Now, among people that
are educated in science,

00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:30.100
this is now taken
as commonplace,

00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:37.170
but it has to be recognized that
this was the main challenge.

00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.470
When Albert Einstein first
articulated his field equations

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:49.960
in 1915, as many
of you might know,

00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:52.610
he actually altered
the equations

00:09:52.610 --> 00:09:56.840
so that it would take away
the idea that the universe was

00:09:56.840 --> 00:09:57.990
expanding.

00:09:57.990 --> 00:10:02.400
It was Alexander Friedman,
a mathematician in Russia,

00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:06.860
that actually discovered
this possibility,

00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.780
and pointed it out to Einstein.

00:10:08.780 --> 00:10:10.450
Einstein had no interest in it.

00:10:10.450 --> 00:10:12.700
So here's Einstein.

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:18.340
He makes a discovery, and it's
too much for him to take in,

00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.380
because there's no
evidence whatsoever

00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:24.390
of an expansion with Einstein.

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:29.780
So this notion of the
universe expanding

00:10:29.780 --> 00:10:33.590
and even, if you
push it further,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:37.790
the very notion that the
trillion galaxies we now

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.820
know about, the
trillion galaxies,

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:43.580
came from something the
size of an apple seed?

00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.940
I mean counterintuitive,
difficult to hold onto to,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.340
but this would be great,
great insight coming out

00:10:53.340 --> 00:10:58.640
of Einstein's work, and
Friedman, and Hubble, Lemaitre,

00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.650
all of them together
arrived at the second,

00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:08.166
the second profoundly
counterintuitive notion.

00:11:08.166 --> 00:11:12.125
It has to do with the
nature of matter itself.

00:11:12.125 --> 00:11:18.390
And this was the whole
quantum insight, but matter,

00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:23.180
from the times of the Greeks
Democritus, Leucippus,

00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:27.870
Epicurus, all of them had
an atomic theory of matter.

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:31.952
And so this was
what Newton loved

00:11:31.952 --> 00:11:34.410
coming from the Greeks, the
idea that the universe consists

00:11:34.410 --> 00:11:37.940
of these hard, massy
objects called atoms.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:43.720
And then it wasn't until Dalton
in the 19th century actually

00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:46.430
investigated it that we started
to realize that, actually,

00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:50.480
empirically, we now
know that the universe

00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:54.110
consists of atoms, these
hard, hard, point-like like

00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:54.800
particles.

00:11:54.800 --> 00:11:59.330
And then this quantum
revolution takes place.

00:11:59.330 --> 00:12:03.970
And the person I'm going
to focus on is Paul Dirac.

00:12:03.970 --> 00:12:10.850
Paul Dirac, like Einstein,
through the mathematics,

00:12:10.850 --> 00:12:18.280
arrives at a puzzling insight
into the nature of universe,

00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.580
namely that-- well, actually,
just like Einstein didn't

00:12:23.580 --> 00:12:25.650
know how to interpret
his own equations that

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:29.890
said it was expanding, he
altered them, with Dirac,

00:12:29.890 --> 00:12:32.260
what he was discovering
in the equations was

00:12:32.260 --> 00:12:34.260
the appearance of
negative energies

00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:35.780
and how to interpret that.

00:12:35.780 --> 00:12:38.630
I mean, he didn't know
how to interpret it.

00:12:38.630 --> 00:12:42.230
But he finally arrived
at the idea of it,

00:12:42.230 --> 00:12:47.320
that this pointed to the
notion of antimatter.

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:49.580
And he published that in 1931.

00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.950
He just went ahead and
threw it out there.

00:12:51.950 --> 00:12:56.400
And he talked about
this ocean, an unseen

00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:03.620
ocean of potentiality, where
these anti-particles existed.

00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.840
1932, Carl Anderson here in
the United States actually

00:13:06.840 --> 00:13:10.290
discovered, discovered
empirically,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.810
the first anti-particle,
the anti-electron,

00:13:13.810 --> 00:13:16.520
soon to be called the positron.

00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:20.480
But the amazing thing
that Dirac arrived at

00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:28.860
was that the point-like
particles of matter

00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:33.310
would disappear when they
met their anti-particle.

00:13:33.310 --> 00:13:36.090
You have a proton that
meets an anti-proton,

00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:39.130
and it disappears
in a flash of light.

00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:44.140
So matter, then, instead
of being something

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:50.120
hard and gritty
indestructible points,

00:13:50.120 --> 00:13:53.590
matter turns out to be
something more like a flame,

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:57.540
or exactly what
it's hard to say.

00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.990
So both of these,
I'm suggesting,

00:13:59.990 --> 00:14:05.090
are some of the reasons,
two of the reasons,

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:08.230
that the emergence of this
story isn't recognized.

00:14:08.230 --> 00:14:14.061
It doesn't quite fit with
our underlying assumptions

00:14:14.061 --> 00:14:15.310
of the nature of the universe.

00:14:15.310 --> 00:14:17.726
There's a third
counterintuitive,

00:14:17.726 --> 00:14:21.440
but I'm going to
introduce that later.

00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:30.060
What I wanted to do now was
to talk about the idea of how

00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:32.850
this story will spread.

00:14:32.850 --> 00:14:39.610
If this story is part of a
change in the human species,

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:47.720
then it will find a way into
the minds and hearts of people

00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.370
other than the mathematics.

00:14:49.370 --> 00:14:51.600
Because very, very few
people can handle that.

00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:56.840
And so the way I wanted to think
about this with you was this--

00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.860
what would be the essence
of this new story coming off

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:01.150
science and technology?

00:15:01.150 --> 00:15:05.100
What would be the
essence that could

00:15:05.100 --> 00:15:08.484
be conveyed to our children?

00:15:08.484 --> 00:15:09.900
I mean, some of
you have children.

00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:12.950
Some of you will have children.

00:15:12.950 --> 00:15:18.550
The fastest way to find out
what one's underlying story

00:15:18.550 --> 00:15:21.950
of reality is, is to
ask ourselves, well,

00:15:21.950 --> 00:15:24.730
how do we explain the
world to our children?

00:15:24.730 --> 00:15:29.310
How do we make it
understandable, reasonable,

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:30.230
whatever?

00:15:30.230 --> 00:15:33.760
I mean, at least when
our children were young,

00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:37.070
we started off, my
wife, it was like you

00:15:37.070 --> 00:15:41.610
want to protect children from
the really harsh realities that

00:15:41.610 --> 00:15:43.250
are out there, but
at a certain point,

00:15:43.250 --> 00:15:45.240
they have to be
introduced to them.

00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:49.636
And so you're forced to give
some kind of explanation

00:15:49.636 --> 00:15:51.430
to what's going on.

00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:55.910
I think that some of
the difficulties we're

00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:59.180
having as a human
species is that we

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.640
have these different ways
of explaining the universe.

00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.490
I don't want to
eliminate the diversity.

00:16:08.490 --> 00:16:11.740
I simply wanted to
indicate, here's another way

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.500
of providing an orientation
to young people,

00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:19.480
using the images that we
have that have come out

00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.380
of our science and technology.

00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:24.100
So here I'm going to
move to some images,

00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:36.360
and give you a sense
of how I would suggest

00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:37.690
this story is being conveyed.

00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.880
Or will be conveyed
to our children.

00:16:41.880 --> 00:16:45.890
OK, so I hit that.

00:16:45.890 --> 00:16:46.390
There.

00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:47.560
OK, fantastic.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:53.300
So here would be the first
image I would begin with.

00:16:53.300 --> 00:17:01.560
And I would tell them,
this is the Wilkinson map.

00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:07.359
This is an image of
the oldest things

00:17:07.359 --> 00:17:09.630
we have found in the universe.

00:17:09.630 --> 00:17:14.329
This light comes from the
furthest distance away.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:18.640
So what we do know is that 14
billion years ago, the universe

00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.950
was very simple.

00:17:19.950 --> 00:17:26.849
It consisted of hydrogen and
helium atoms, and that was it.

00:17:29.440 --> 00:17:34.420
And then as you-- yes, OK.

00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:38.970
And then, as we move forward in
time, within a billion years,

00:17:38.970 --> 00:17:41.970
the hydrogen and
helium atoms actually

00:17:41.970 --> 00:17:44.770
organized themselves in
the form of the galaxies.

00:17:44.770 --> 00:17:48.160
Now, this movement from
hydrogen and helium

00:17:48.160 --> 00:17:53.740
to galaxies, the question
is, how does this take place?

00:17:53.740 --> 00:17:58.950
And the phrase that
is emerging is simply

00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:02.635
in terms of the self-organizing
dynamics of the universe,

00:18:02.635 --> 00:18:04.905
the self-organizing
dynamics of universe.

00:18:08.390 --> 00:18:10.800
Up until the 20th
century-- So humans

00:18:10.800 --> 00:18:14.380
have been around
for 200,000 years.

00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:18.010
Up until the 20th
century, we wondered

00:18:18.010 --> 00:18:21.840
about the band of light
that we call the Milky Way.

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.520
And every culture, not every,
but many, many cultures,

00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:28.690
had a story about what
that band of light is.

00:18:28.690 --> 00:18:31.600
And it was in the 20th century
we began to resolve and see

00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:32.850
that there are stars.

00:18:32.850 --> 00:18:37.620
And we realized we actually are
inside of a galaxy, the Milky

00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:40.110
Way Galaxy, we call it.

00:18:40.110 --> 00:18:44.310
But not scientists
didn't know if the Milky

00:18:44.310 --> 00:18:49.830
Way was the entire universe,
or if it was one of many.

00:18:49.830 --> 00:18:52.600
So Harlow Shapley
at Harvard, he was

00:18:52.600 --> 00:18:55.720
convinced-- he was the
reigning astronomer

00:18:55.720 --> 00:18:57.560
in the early 20th century.

00:18:57.560 --> 00:19:03.290
He was convinced the Milky
Way Galaxy was the universe.

00:19:03.290 --> 00:19:07.880
And so we don't have a lot
of experience with galaxies.

00:19:07.880 --> 00:19:10.660
Then it was Hubble in the 1920s.

00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:15.690
He realized that
these smudges of light

00:19:15.690 --> 00:19:19.020
actually were far outside
of the Milky Way Galaxy.

00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:26.260
That was the moment when the
understanding of the universe

00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:29.490
multiplied by a billion fold.

00:19:29.490 --> 00:19:32.872
There has never been a moment
in the history of humanity

00:19:32.872 --> 00:19:38.050
that we know about when
the universe that was

00:19:38.050 --> 00:19:43.097
reflect upon in consciousness
magnified to such an extent.

00:19:43.097 --> 00:19:45.555
Like I was saying, we're right
in the middle of that change

00:19:45.555 --> 00:19:48.180
over.

00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:53.690
When the scientists first
began to look at the galaxies,

00:19:53.690 --> 00:19:59.880
they were stunned by the
appearance of these arms.

00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:06.290
And universally, they were
thought to be made of matter.

00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:10.260
It was simply the way in which
the stars were distributed.

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:15.410
But it was in the 1960s that,
actually, the astronomers

00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:18.440
began to realize, no, no, no.

00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:22.060
Those are not matter arms
that are moving through space.

00:20:22.060 --> 00:20:26.270
They're actually
density waves created

00:20:26.270 --> 00:20:28.940
by the galaxy as a whole.

00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:35.050
And the density waves that
are passing through the galaxy

00:20:35.050 --> 00:20:37.750
and igniting the stars.

00:20:37.750 --> 00:20:41.860
They're igniting stars that burn
brightly for a million years,

00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:43.180
and then die out.

00:20:43.180 --> 00:20:46.799
And then the wave goes
on and ignites new stars.

00:20:46.799 --> 00:20:49.090
I love this phrase, that when
the first scientists were

00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:53.410
thinking about this, looking
at the Whirlpool Galaxy,

00:20:53.410 --> 00:20:55.310
but a galaxy like
this, and they're

00:20:55.310 --> 00:21:00.900
realizing that it was the
galaxy as a whole that

00:21:00.900 --> 00:21:04.010
was creating these stars.

00:21:04.010 --> 00:21:06.710
I forget the name
of the one, but he

00:21:06.710 --> 00:21:12.190
said, I realized we were looking
at something like a cell,

00:21:12.190 --> 00:21:16.800
something like a biologically
organism, a cell.

00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.900
And that switch,
I would say, would

00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:27.120
be very close to the
fundamental change that

00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.280
is being called for by
this emerging story,

00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:35.950
namely the switch from, we have
assumed the universe consists

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:40.000
of objects distributed
throughout space,

00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.535
and now we began to
realize that there

00:21:42.535 --> 00:21:46.620
are entities that are involved
with self-organization.

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.850
That would be the fundamental
shift-- from objects

00:21:49.850 --> 00:21:54.680
to self-organizing events.

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:57.870
And then just a close up
on some of the clouds.

00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:02.270
So here we have a cloud
of hydrogen, and helium,

00:22:02.270 --> 00:22:06.970
and the wave passing through.

00:22:06.970 --> 00:22:10.680
It squeezes together
the cloud, and ignite

00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.330
its old self-organizing
dynamics.

00:22:14.330 --> 00:22:17.120
And we have the birth of a star.

00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:21.270
The star no longer needs
that wave, that density wave.

00:22:21.270 --> 00:22:24.875
It has its own dynamics.

00:22:24.875 --> 00:22:27.730
Throughout the modern
period, scientists

00:22:27.730 --> 00:22:32.850
wondered about where the
heat came from the sun.

00:22:32.850 --> 00:22:34.640
I mean, how is it possible?

00:22:34.640 --> 00:22:36.052
What was the source of it?

00:22:36.052 --> 00:22:37.760
Isaac Newton even
wondered if maybe there

00:22:37.760 --> 00:22:40.570
was a giant pile of
wood that was burning.

00:22:40.570 --> 00:22:44.040
And he calculated
that it would have

00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:48.500
to be at least 50,000
years before it burn out.

00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.440
So it's been burning
50,000 years.

00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:57.160
Now that catapulted him out of
the cultural story of his time.

00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.125
Because the chronology was
way, way different than he

00:23:00.125 --> 00:23:01.720
was Discovering.

00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:06.230
But it wasn't until
the 1950s that we

00:23:06.230 --> 00:23:11.160
realize that the energy is
coming from the nuclear fusion

00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.680
in the center.

00:23:12.680 --> 00:23:16.850
I'm just trying to emphasize the
fact that these were questions

00:23:16.850 --> 00:23:20.880
that no doubt entered
into the minds of humans

00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:23.870
over the last 200,000 years.

00:23:23.870 --> 00:23:27.400
We have evidence of
cultural artifacts

00:23:27.400 --> 00:23:32.310
in South Africa that
are 77,000 years old.

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.220
So I mean, were they
thinking about the stars?

00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:37.940
It's easy to imagine that that
would come into their mind

00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:40.130
every now and then.

00:23:40.130 --> 00:23:42.405
But it wasn't until
the 1950s, and I'm

00:23:42.405 --> 00:23:45.670
trying to emphasize the fact
that so many of these things

00:23:45.670 --> 00:23:49.890
are just emerging, just coming
together in our lifetime.

00:23:57.570 --> 00:24:03.080
So then, again, to convey the
story to young people, here

00:24:03.080 --> 00:24:06.890
we have this star
that's organized itself,

00:24:06.890 --> 00:24:09.790
and now we know where its
energy is coming from.

00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:13.510
It's transforming itself
from the very center.

00:24:13.510 --> 00:24:16.595
It's transforming
hydrogen into helium.

00:24:16.595 --> 00:24:22.550
And in the process, it's
converting four million tons

00:24:22.550 --> 00:24:25.530
into light every second.

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:30.860
So another four million tons,
another four million tons.

00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:35.510
That light emanates
in all directions.

00:24:35.510 --> 00:24:41.480
Earth captures one billionth of
the light that's left the sun.

00:24:44.085 --> 00:24:48.980
And every human act
from the beginning

00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:53.320
has been powered by that
small little spike of energy,

00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:56.500
one billionth from the sun.

00:24:56.500 --> 00:25:04.710
So it's the greatest poetry
is powered by the sun.

00:25:04.710 --> 00:25:08.800
The greatest insights in
philosophy and mathematics,

00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:14.738
all of them, in a certain sense,
can be considered solar events.

00:25:14.738 --> 00:25:15.946
The human isn't disconnected.

00:25:15.946 --> 00:25:20.310
The human is actually
in that flow of energy,

00:25:20.310 --> 00:25:24.380
and we're bringing it
into a new form, for sure,

00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:30.860
but its origin is
the sun itself.

00:25:30.860 --> 00:25:35.630
This is an exploding
star, Eta Carinae.

00:25:35.630 --> 00:25:39.130
It's something like
7,500 light years away.

00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:43.930
It's 200 or 300 times
bigger than our sun.

00:25:43.930 --> 00:25:47.700
And this, I think,
if there's one thing

00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.830
I wish all children of
the world could learn

00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:54.080
about the new story, it's this.

00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:59.710
I mean, it's just such
a spectacular insight,

00:25:59.710 --> 00:26:02.460
that the stars give birth.

00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:04.500
They create the elements.

00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.942
They create hydrogen,
and they create helium.

00:26:06.942 --> 00:26:08.900
They create carbon,
phosphorous, and nitrogen--

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.500
all of the elements.

00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.440
And then through the
explosion and the dispersal,

00:26:16.440 --> 00:26:18.700
our bodies are
constructed out of them.

00:26:22.640 --> 00:26:24.480
My wife teaches second
grade, and so she

00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:29.720
has me come in and give talks
to the kids every now and then.

00:26:29.720 --> 00:26:31.140
And so there they are.

00:26:31.140 --> 00:26:33.140
They're seven years old.

00:26:33.140 --> 00:26:39.140
And so I'm telling, I'm
saying, the stars blew up,

00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:42.760
and they created the
carbon and phosphorus--

00:26:42.760 --> 00:26:49.190
I use those words-- the elements
of our bodies, the elements.

00:26:49.190 --> 00:26:51.220
they come from an
exploding star.

00:26:51.220 --> 00:26:55.850
And Ahmed, his eyes were
just-- he's just staring at me,

00:26:55.850 --> 00:27:01.670
and I saw his hand just
go up and touch his skin.

00:27:01.670 --> 00:27:03.540
It was just such a great moment.

00:27:03.540 --> 00:27:04.380
He was realizing.

00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:07.320
He was discovering something
about the nature of what

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.130
it means to be a human being.

00:27:09.130 --> 00:27:13.160
I mean, it was like this
skin came from a star!

00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:15.630
It was like a larger identity.

00:27:15.630 --> 00:27:19.630
He was moving out of
understanding himself

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:22.190
as an American, or
a French person,

00:27:22.190 --> 00:27:25.070
or whatever-- a larger
and larger identity,

00:27:25.070 --> 00:27:27.340
every human being.

00:27:27.340 --> 00:27:29.770
The way he touched
his skin, he was

00:27:29.770 --> 00:27:32.250
entering into another
moment in his life.

00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:38.680
And then another time, that was
second grade. then my wife also

00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.887
taught kindergartner.

00:27:39.887 --> 00:27:42.220
So then I went in there and
gave a little different kind

00:27:42.220 --> 00:27:45.110
of explanation.

00:27:45.110 --> 00:27:49.230
And so one time I was telling
them about the stars exploding.

00:27:49.230 --> 00:27:51.850
I said, the stars, the
stars, they gave birth

00:27:51.850 --> 00:27:53.810
to the elements of your skin.

00:27:53.810 --> 00:27:59.784
And this little kid looked up
at me and said, I know that.

00:27:59.784 --> 00:28:00.980
And I don't know.

00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:02.270
Did he know it?

00:28:02.270 --> 00:28:03.670
Was he just trying to please me?

00:28:03.670 --> 00:28:04.770
I don't know.

00:28:04.770 --> 00:28:09.810
I mean, he'd only been
here a few years, right?

00:28:09.810 --> 00:28:14.565
But it was just this sense.

00:28:14.565 --> 00:28:22.770
Now, this notion that the stars
give birth to the elements

00:28:22.770 --> 00:28:26.130
is from 1954, Fred Hoyle.

00:28:26.130 --> 00:28:27.860
So just imagine.

00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:31.970
So for 200,000, all the way
through that time, when anybody

00:28:31.970 --> 00:28:35.000
wondered where does
this stuff come from,

00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.780
no one knew, at least
in recorded history.

00:28:38.780 --> 00:28:42.650
No one knew with anything
like our certainly

00:28:42.650 --> 00:28:49.890
that carbon comes from a star.

00:28:49.890 --> 00:28:52.540
Another way to say it, maybe
I'm belaboring the point,

00:28:52.540 --> 00:29:00.510
but for the existence of
a single atom of carbon,

00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.220
we need a galaxy.

00:29:03.220 --> 00:29:07.040
We have no way of imagining,
at least scientifically,

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.100
the construction
of carbon atoms,

00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.450
unless we have a galaxy that's
creating stars that explode.

00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:20.280
So what does it
mean to be human?

00:29:20.280 --> 00:29:21.080
What does it mean?

00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:23.800
These are the kinds of questions
that every cultural story will

00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:25.330
ask.

00:29:25.330 --> 00:29:29.400
And the perspective that we
have now, that to be human

00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:33.280
is to be a cosmic
event, in certain ways.

00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:37.680
We come out of a cosmic process.

00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:48.060
So certainly we've been
aware of the planets

00:29:48.060 --> 00:29:49.160
all around the world.

00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:51.360
But then we wonder, are
there other planets?

00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:56.540
1992 is the first
discovery of an exo-planet,

00:29:56.540 --> 00:29:59.380
and now there are hundreds
that we've identified.

00:29:59.380 --> 00:30:02.450
But just extrapolating,
we imagine

00:30:02.450 --> 00:30:05.510
there are many
billions of planets,

00:30:05.510 --> 00:30:08.250
many billions of planets
in the Milky Way alone.

00:30:08.250 --> 00:30:11.640
And so we have two basic kinds.

00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:13.560
We have gaseous planets.

00:30:13.560 --> 00:30:17.010
Jupiter is like a small
star that didn't ignite.

00:30:17.010 --> 00:30:22.600
And we have these rocky
planets, like Mars.

00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:24.652
I mean, astronomers
know this, of course.

00:30:24.652 --> 00:30:26.110
They've known this
for a long time,

00:30:26.110 --> 00:30:30.080
but, again, the
general public doesn't

00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:35.890
realize that Mars
is fundamentally

00:30:35.890 --> 00:30:39.200
different from Earth in terms
of its overall dynamics.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:45.600
And in a simple, phrase,
Mars is like a solid rock

00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:46.930
all the way through.

00:30:46.930 --> 00:30:51.106
It's solid and fixed.

00:30:51.106 --> 00:30:53.120
But this is the
opposite of Jupiter,

00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:55.220
which is chaotic gases.

00:30:55.220 --> 00:30:59.670
But right in between, in
between the solid planets,

00:30:59.670 --> 00:31:01.870
totally solid, and
the gaseous ones,

00:31:01.870 --> 00:31:04.650
there's this range
of where you have

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:07.930
a balance between the
gravitational interaction

00:31:07.930 --> 00:31:12.680
and the electromagnetic,
and that the planet can

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.770
remain fluid, in a sense.

00:31:15.770 --> 00:31:24.870
So Earth occupies
that slender range

00:31:24.870 --> 00:31:30.800
where it's able to
create structures,

00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.280
and yet, it doesn't fixate.

00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.700
So the lava, the
lava comes forth.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:46.000
But what distinguishes Earth
from these other billions

00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:52.160
of plants, from Jupiter and
Mars-- it's not the material.

00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:56.200
The same minerals,
the same atoms

00:31:56.200 --> 00:31:59.580
are present in all
of these planets.

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:05.530
It is the fundamental dynamics
coming from the size of Earth.

00:32:05.530 --> 00:32:08.635
So the Earth, because
it's in between the chaos

00:32:08.635 --> 00:32:12.470
and the rigidity,
it remains fluid,

00:32:12.470 --> 00:32:16.830
and we have lava coming forth.

00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:23.410
And this would be the
second most important thing

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:27.600
I would like to convey to
every child on the planet.

00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:30.680
The Earth, because it's
in this creative zone,

00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.260
is able to evoke the
creative dynamics that

00:32:34.260 --> 00:32:36.770
give birth to this.

00:32:36.770 --> 00:32:44.330
This amazing being
comes forth from this.

00:32:44.330 --> 00:32:51.080
So molten earth precisely
because it can bring forth

00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.380
the self-organizing
dynamics of the universe,

00:32:55.380 --> 00:32:58.550
is able to bring forth the eyes.

00:32:58.550 --> 00:33:00.230
Look at these eyes.

00:33:00.230 --> 00:33:04.980
These eyes were brought
here from some other place.

00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:08.455
They are the ongoing
development of molten lava.

00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:16.240
So what in a sense, have
we learned about this?

00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:19.170
What does this mean?

00:33:19.170 --> 00:33:22.410
I think it gives a sense of
what it means to be creative.

00:33:22.410 --> 00:33:25.660
The Earth is the most
creative planet we know about.

00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.195
It remains in this zone.

00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:33.970
one phrase is
balanced turbulence.

00:33:33.970 --> 00:33:37.670
Remain in the zone of balanced
turbulence and creativity

00:33:37.670 --> 00:33:39.670
happens.

00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:43.620
It would be the same-- Mars
was molten for a while,

00:33:43.620 --> 00:33:44.790
but it didn't it.

00:33:44.790 --> 00:33:47.455
It froze up.

00:33:47.455 --> 00:33:49.950
So we didn't really get
a theory of the this,

00:33:49.950 --> 00:33:54.485
of what Earth does, until the
1960s, with plate tectonics.

00:33:54.485 --> 00:33:56.050
So again, so recent.

00:33:56.050 --> 00:33:56.550
You see?

00:33:56.550 --> 00:34:00.230
We're just getting to understand
the overall dynamics of Earth

00:34:00.230 --> 00:34:01.990
as a whole.

00:34:01.990 --> 00:34:08.929
But this anthropologist at UC
Berkeley had a great phrase.

00:34:08.929 --> 00:34:11.670
Trying to think about
what it means to be human,

00:34:11.670 --> 00:34:13.780
he said this.

00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:19.510
The ideal condition for a human
being is not bovine placidity.

00:34:19.510 --> 00:34:22.330
It is, rather, the
highest degree of tension

00:34:22.330 --> 00:34:25.226
that can be creatively borne.

00:34:25.226 --> 00:34:29.534
And I think of that as a way of
also describing the Earth-- not

00:34:29.534 --> 00:34:30.956
bovine placidity.

00:34:30.956 --> 00:34:33.321
It's not some rigidity fixed.

00:34:33.321 --> 00:34:34.779
It's the highest
degree of tension.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.210
This is also the third
counterintuitive part

00:34:48.210 --> 00:34:49.573
of the new story.

00:34:49.573 --> 00:34:50.989
Remember, I said
there were three?

00:34:50.989 --> 00:34:51.969
This is the third one.

00:34:51.969 --> 00:34:58.100
The third one is the
relationship of consciousness

00:34:58.100 --> 00:34:59.500
to the universe as a whole.

00:35:05.130 --> 00:35:09.170
We don't have a theory
of consciousness

00:35:09.170 --> 00:35:13.510
that would match Dirac's
theory of Quantum Field Theory,

00:35:13.510 --> 00:35:15.940
or Einstein's General
Theory of Relativity.

00:35:15.940 --> 00:35:20.070
I think we're waiting for,
it, and some scientists

00:35:20.070 --> 00:35:23.940
are convinced that when
this theory emerges,

00:35:23.940 --> 00:35:29.670
it will be at a par with
Einstein's, a par with Darwin.

00:35:29.670 --> 00:35:32.970
It's like a piece that's
just coming forth.

00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:41.210
But already, there's a way in
which what we're discovering

00:35:41.210 --> 00:35:43.265
is counterintuitive.

00:35:43.265 --> 00:35:47.550
Our default assumption
around human consciousness,

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:51.500
our default assumption is that
it exists only within humans.

00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:53.950
And this goes right
back to Rene Descartes,

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:57.560
the principal philosopher
of the modern era.

00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:58.630
Humans were conscious.

00:35:58.630 --> 00:36:00.740
All else were mechanisms.

00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:03.230
All other machines
were mechanical.

00:36:03.230 --> 00:36:05.780
And his point was
that if you hear

00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:10.930
or if you see a dog suffering,
you think the dog is suffering.

00:36:10.930 --> 00:36:13.510
It's really just
malfunctioning machinery.

00:36:13.510 --> 00:36:16.840
We project our feelings onto it.

00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:20.970
So that was the dominant view
throughout the modern period,

00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:22.640
but it's been breaking down.

00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.890
And there a great celebrated
moment around this

00:36:26.890 --> 00:36:29.996
was the Cambridge Declaration.

00:36:29.996 --> 00:36:31.120
Perhaps you've heard of it.

00:36:31.120 --> 00:36:33.100
This was in 2012.

00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:37.380
Major brain scientists meeting
at Cambridge University

00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:43.735
just made this statement that
non-human animals, all mammals,

00:36:43.735 --> 00:36:51.770
all birds, even octopuses, have
the neurological substrates

00:36:51.770 --> 00:36:53.660
of consciousness.

00:36:53.660 --> 00:37:00.080
they came out boldly and said,
in all of these creatures,

00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.640
there is some form
of consciousness.

00:37:01.640 --> 00:37:03.700
And I've just read The
New York Times today,

00:37:03.700 --> 00:37:06.530
and scientists now,
some scientists

00:37:06.530 --> 00:37:09.380
at Macquarie University
in Australia,

00:37:09.380 --> 00:37:13.860
said that insects also have
a form of consciousness.

00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:17.070
And then there's the
whole question of robots.

00:37:17.070 --> 00:37:19.980
Do robots have consciousness?

00:37:19.980 --> 00:37:23.880
I'm simply saying
that this is yet

00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:30.480
another revolution in our
understanding of the universe

00:37:30.480 --> 00:37:33.030
and how prevalent
consciousness is.

00:37:33.030 --> 00:37:34.700
Let me tell you a
little story, though.

00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:38.120
So I don't have any
giant opinion about that,

00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:42.800
but I do want to
tell you this story.

00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:47.150
So a friend of mine,
Dr. Barbara Smuts

00:37:47.150 --> 00:37:50.960
at the University of
Michigan, studies baboons.

00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:54.275
And so she will live with
them for years at a time.

00:37:57.965 --> 00:38:00.000
And so she'll travel
with them, and she'll

00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.890
eat the same things
they do, and she just

00:38:01.890 --> 00:38:02.940
really lives their life.

00:38:02.940 --> 00:38:04.148
There's this one great story.

00:38:04.148 --> 00:38:05.500
She fell asleep one time.

00:38:05.500 --> 00:38:09.120
And something woke her up.

00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.550
And she looked, and it
was a young male baboon.

00:38:15.550 --> 00:38:19.965
And it was, just to give you
a close-up on the fingernail,

00:38:19.965 --> 00:38:24.555
the young male baboon had placed
its finger right next to hers

00:38:24.555 --> 00:38:26.530
while she was sleeping.

00:38:26.530 --> 00:38:29.000
And while she woke
up, he was looking

00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.850
at her finger and
her finger together,

00:38:31.850 --> 00:38:33.600
and then looking
up at her, kind of

00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.580
astonished, and then
back at the fingernail,

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:39.770
and then back up her.

00:38:39.770 --> 00:38:44.100
The primate intelligence
was making a connection

00:38:44.100 --> 00:38:46.490
in the universe
that was surprising.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:53.300
This, in a real sense, I see as
the very essence of a science

00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:53.800
itself.

00:38:56.510 --> 00:39:01.180
Humans have forever been
looking for these patterns.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:04.280
And so this is Stonehenge.

00:39:04.280 --> 00:39:05.006
Why?

00:39:05.006 --> 00:39:09.020
Why would they
build this monument?

00:39:09.020 --> 00:39:12.760
Because they wanted
to align themselves

00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.610
with the powers in the
universe, the patterns,

00:39:15.610 --> 00:39:19.085
the processes in the universe.

00:39:19.085 --> 00:39:22.450
And I think that we are
still doing the same thing.

00:39:22.450 --> 00:39:24.754
It's an ongoing process.

00:39:24.754 --> 00:39:27.170
I talk about the discovery of
relativity and quantum field

00:39:27.170 --> 00:39:28.940
theory, it's ongoing.

00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:30.455
Consciousness.

00:39:30.455 --> 00:39:32.150
So here's Einstein.

00:39:32.150 --> 00:39:34.940
I started off
talking about how he

00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:38.680
didn't believe the
prediction of own equations.

00:39:38.680 --> 00:39:40.109
Edward Hubble called him up.

00:39:40.109 --> 00:39:42.150
He said, honestly, Al,
you oughta come down here,

00:39:42.150 --> 00:39:43.200
take a look.

00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:49.640
He did, and looked
out, and what he saw

00:39:49.640 --> 00:39:54.664
was, well, as a poorer
version of this.

00:39:54.664 --> 00:39:56.080
This is from the
Hubble telescope.

00:39:56.080 --> 00:39:58.320
But Einstein was
looking out, and he

00:39:58.320 --> 00:40:05.280
saw, in fact, the universe
is expanding, the redshift.

00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:10.500
And so every one of these dots,
except for the three stars

00:40:10.500 --> 00:40:14.170
over there, every one of
these dots is a galaxy.

00:40:14.170 --> 00:40:17.580
And this is obviously
a still photo.

00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:21.850
But in real time,
they're moving apart.

00:40:21.850 --> 00:40:24.770
And then, in 1973,
Stephen Hawking

00:40:24.770 --> 00:40:28.850
just did analysis of
the movement itself.

00:40:28.850 --> 00:40:32.190
He learned something
alarming for all of us,

00:40:32.190 --> 00:40:35.220
that if you altered the
expansion by one part and 10

00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.160
to 16th, the universe,
in either direction,

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:41.270
if you alter it in one
part and 10 to 16th,

00:40:41.270 --> 00:40:47.070
the universe would collapse,
or it would explode.

00:40:47.070 --> 00:40:50.530
So if you slowed it down
by one part and 10 to 16th,

00:40:50.530 --> 00:40:53.460
it would collapse immediately
into a black hole.

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:56.350
If the expansion had been
greater than one part and 10

00:40:56.350 --> 00:40:59.160
to 16th at the beginning,
it would expand into dust--

00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:00.780
no galaxies.

00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:09.080
So the question of the
expansion rate of the universe

00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:15.030
is a major conundrum
in theoretical physics.

00:41:15.030 --> 00:41:16.380
No clear answer.

00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:22.720
Why only want to emphasize
one thing that Hawkings said

00:41:22.720 --> 00:41:24.750
that I think is just wonderful.

00:41:24.750 --> 00:41:26.520
So here's Hawking.

00:41:26.520 --> 00:41:28.840
He's attempting to
make sense of this.

00:41:28.840 --> 00:41:31.580
Why is the universe
expanding this way?

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:32.680
Why?

00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:39.010
And his answer, here's his
answer-- "Because we are here."

00:41:39.010 --> 00:41:40.220
"Because we are here."

00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:41.850
And what did he mean by that?

00:41:41.850 --> 00:41:47.300
He meant that, first
of all, if we're here,

00:41:47.300 --> 00:41:49.600
if we're here, if
there's anybody here,

00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:55.040
the universe didn't collapse
back down into a black hole.

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:59.300
And if there's somebody
here who's thinking,

00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:01.140
it didn't separate into dust.

00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:06.510
So if we're here, the expansion
had to be exactly that rate.

00:42:06.510 --> 00:42:10.180
Also, if there's a
complex human being here,

00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:12.300
who's able to reflect
on all of this,

00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:14.330
we've gotta build
up organic life.

00:42:14.330 --> 00:42:17.580
That takes billions of years.

00:42:17.580 --> 00:42:19.590
That takes billions of years.

00:42:19.590 --> 00:42:24.690
So for an intelligent
observer to be

00:42:24.690 --> 00:42:29.760
noting the size
and age of universe

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:33.355
shows you what the
universe has to be.

00:42:33.355 --> 00:42:38.790
I had this picture on our
wall back in New York.

00:42:38.790 --> 00:42:42.480
And one of my wife's friends
was there, who's a lawyer.

00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:45.520
And when she asked
what it was, I

00:42:45.520 --> 00:42:48.020
gave a quick little
explanation, it's

00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.980
the nearest million galaxies.

00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:54.820
And she actually ran out of
the room and across the street,

00:42:54.820 --> 00:43:01.160
because it was so overwhelming
to her, so overwhelming.

00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:07.230
To think of ourselves
lost in the vastness,

00:43:07.230 --> 00:43:11.510
an insignificant little
cipher in the vastness,

00:43:11.510 --> 00:43:16.000
is to be yet in
the modern story.

00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.964
What is the new story?

00:43:17.964 --> 00:43:18.880
What is the new story?

00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:21.800
The new story is
like I've just said.

00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:23.830
The universe is
exactly what it would

00:43:23.830 --> 00:43:29.850
be for us to be here,
meaning-- another physicist put

00:43:29.850 --> 00:43:31.710
it this way.

00:43:31.710 --> 00:43:39.850
This is the smallest universe we
could fit into-- the smallest.

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:41.980
We couldn't fit
anything smaller.

00:43:41.980 --> 00:43:46.200
The universe, to build up this
kind of complexity that we are,

00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:48.920
had to be this big.

00:43:48.920 --> 00:43:50.740
Another phrase
which I like so much

00:43:50.740 --> 00:43:56.020
is, we, humans, or any
advanced form of life,

00:43:56.020 --> 00:44:00.140
fit into the universe
like a hand into a glove.

00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.820
So it gives a
different orientation,

00:44:02.820 --> 00:44:04.060
a different kind of feeling.

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.700
So we're coming to this
understanding of the universe

00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:16.860
right as we are carrying
out, unwittingly,

00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:18.425
a mass extinction of species.

00:44:25.460 --> 00:44:27.895
So there's never been
an any destruction

00:44:27.895 --> 00:44:33.120
like what's taking place now
over the last 65 million years.

00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:38.420
So right as we're discovering
the majesty of our universe,

00:44:38.420 --> 00:44:40.695
we're ending an
entire era of life.

00:44:49.310 --> 00:44:52.210
I like to think this
moment like the moment

00:44:52.210 --> 00:44:55.650
in the "Matrix" film.

00:44:55.650 --> 00:44:59.900
So there's Neo, and he's
being offered two pills.

00:44:59.900 --> 00:45:05.760
And one pill is, just keep going
with things the way they are.

00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:14.410
And the other pill
is about recognizing

00:45:14.410 --> 00:45:20.240
that we don't live in a
collection of objects,

00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.305
but rather we're a part of
an amazing community of life.

00:45:26.305 --> 00:45:30.210
And it's almost we have
this fundamental choice

00:45:30.210 --> 00:45:32.920
of consciousness to make.

00:45:32.920 --> 00:45:33.850
Thank you so much.

00:45:33.850 --> 00:45:34.732
Thank you for coming.

00:45:34.732 --> 00:45:35.690
I really appreciate it.

00:45:35.690 --> 00:45:40.720
I'd love to hear
any reflections.

00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:47.390
I don't necessarily want to have
only questions, just anything

00:45:47.390 --> 00:45:50.010
that you're thinking about.

00:45:50.010 --> 00:45:52.870
Like I try to indicate,
this emerging story

00:45:52.870 --> 00:45:55.580
is unfinished for sure.

00:45:55.580 --> 00:45:57.550
And so we all have
different kinds

00:45:57.550 --> 00:46:00.095
of perspectives
and orientations,

00:46:00.095 --> 00:46:02.465
and I'd love to
hear any of those.

00:46:02.465 --> 00:46:04.590
AUDIENCE: I'd love to know
how your thoughts on how

00:46:04.590 --> 00:46:06.750
this new emerging
story, which I guess I

00:46:06.750 --> 00:46:09.240
would term as cosmology or
something associated with it,

00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:12.009
how that fits in, or how
we can reconcile that

00:46:12.009 --> 00:46:14.050
with the old stories that
are currently existing,

00:46:14.050 --> 00:46:19.300
if that's even possible, or
if we need to proactively help

00:46:19.300 --> 00:46:20.930
the demise of the old stories.

00:46:20.930 --> 00:46:23.155
Is that too dramatic?

00:46:23.155 --> 00:46:24.030
BRIAN SWIMME: No. no.

00:46:24.030 --> 00:46:25.863
AUDIENCE: I'm talking
about science skeptics

00:46:25.863 --> 00:46:28.901
and other orientations
of truths.

00:46:28.901 --> 00:46:30.234
BRIAN SWIMME: Say the last part.

00:46:30.234 --> 00:46:31.100
I missed it.

00:46:31.100 --> 00:46:36.369
AUDIENCE: Other orientations of
truth that may contradict it.

00:46:36.369 --> 00:46:37.660
BRIAN SWIMME: Want to pick one?

00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:38.470
[CHUCKLING]

00:46:38.470 --> 00:46:38.970
No, no.

00:46:38.970 --> 00:46:39.700
You don't have to.

00:46:39.700 --> 00:46:41.025
AUDIENCE: I'm just trying
to be politically correct.

00:46:41.025 --> 00:46:42.210
BRIAN SWIMME: Yeah. yeah, I see.

00:46:42.210 --> 00:46:42.760
Well, no.

00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:47.040
OK, your question,
I mean, it couldn't

00:46:47.040 --> 00:46:48.870
be more important and relevant.

00:46:51.630 --> 00:46:55.240
I mean, how much of the violence
taking place around the planet

00:46:55.240 --> 00:46:58.170
is related to just
that question, right?

00:46:58.170 --> 00:47:05.410
So the fundamentalists, whether
fundamentalist scientists,

00:47:05.410 --> 00:47:07.097
fundamentalist
religionists, I mean,

00:47:07.097 --> 00:47:08.930
talking about fundamentalists
from the point

00:47:08.930 --> 00:47:11.450
of your religion,
many of them will

00:47:11.450 --> 00:47:18.390
regard science and materialism
as the source of all

00:47:18.390 --> 00:47:21.070
the destruction taking place.

00:47:21.070 --> 00:47:26.295
Insist that we would
be named Satan.

00:47:26.295 --> 00:47:28.070
And so what I'm
trying to suggest

00:47:28.070 --> 00:47:36.760
is that if we can
allow ourselves just

00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:41.180
to feel the majesty
of what is before us,

00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:47.220
if we can just have to touch
of awe concerning the universe,

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.320
I think some of
those disagreements

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:55.320
and arguments will
become less important.

00:47:55.320 --> 00:48:04.230
I mean, even though I'm just
amazed at what we've learned,

00:48:04.230 --> 00:48:07.940
all of us here know, if you
go into it deeply enough,

00:48:07.940 --> 00:48:11.550
you realize we know
next to nothing.

00:48:11.550 --> 00:48:14.070
There's so much more to learn.

00:48:14.070 --> 00:48:17.130
So I think that the
proper orientation

00:48:17.130 --> 00:48:21.670
is one of humility, one
of deep, deep humility,

00:48:21.670 --> 00:48:29.050
and that if we
begin with a sense

00:48:29.050 --> 00:48:34.320
that we recognize we're on
this journey of discovery, then

00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:40.830
we can see one another as
part of the same journey.

00:48:40.830 --> 00:48:43.770
And rather than identifying
people as dead wrong,

00:48:43.770 --> 00:48:44.870
I think that's a mistake.

00:48:44.870 --> 00:48:47.923
Because I think
that limits us down.

00:48:51.630 --> 00:48:58.880
So my own sense is
that science itself

00:48:58.880 --> 00:49:03.650
provides an amazing
context for discussion.

00:49:03.650 --> 00:49:07.320
So whether a person's coming
from an ancient religious point

00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:11.770
of view, or a more contemporary
philosophical point of view,

00:49:11.770 --> 00:49:15.190
the discussion is going to
take place within the universe.

00:49:15.190 --> 00:49:17.730
So I don't think
science is going

00:49:17.730 --> 00:49:24.150
to make these kind of certain
and finished judgments

00:49:24.150 --> 00:49:28.530
about the wisdom that
exist in other traditions.

00:49:28.530 --> 00:49:29.272
What's your view?

00:49:29.272 --> 00:49:30.730
AUDIENCE: I tend
to agree with you.

00:49:30.730 --> 00:49:33.100
I do think that these
co-exist in different ways,

00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:35.330
and they aren't mutually
against each other,

00:49:35.330 --> 00:49:38.290
despite what the
politics of it tends to.

00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:42.240
BRIAN SWIMME: Thank you.

00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:44.156
AUDIENCE: I mean, I think
the best orientation

00:49:44.156 --> 00:49:46.380
is one of curiosity and
wanting to learn more.

00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.754
And that's something
that I think

00:49:47.754 --> 00:49:50.216
is shared across all
human beings in general.

00:49:50.216 --> 00:49:52.590
So I think that's something
that I'd like to make centric

00:49:52.590 --> 00:49:54.360
as part of this new story.

00:49:54.360 --> 00:50:00.080
BRIAN SWIMME: Yeah,
curiosity I mean,

00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:03.510
the things that we really do
well as humans, what are they?

00:50:03.510 --> 00:50:04.450
We're curious.

00:50:04.450 --> 00:50:06.290
We discover things.

00:50:06.290 --> 00:50:08.680
So that's fundamental, for sure.

00:50:08.680 --> 00:50:10.190
Yeah.

00:50:10.190 --> 00:50:10.870
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:50:10.870 --> 00:50:13.140
So I guess I agree,
but I think, while you

00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.530
say curiosity is
something that's inherent,

00:50:15.530 --> 00:50:19.140
I think that perhaps
humility is not something

00:50:19.140 --> 00:50:22.230
that is inherent to all people.

00:50:22.230 --> 00:50:25.140
And so I think it's an
interesting perspective,

00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:30.250
because like you say, it's
all happening so very quickly.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:32.060
And there's things that
have been engrained

00:50:32.060 --> 00:50:34.700
in human culture
for a very long time

00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:37.540
that, sure, we can say
they're being answered,

00:50:37.540 --> 00:50:40.390
but if there's a whole lot
of people that don't believe

00:50:40.390 --> 00:50:44.520
that it's actually an answer,
then it's creating this divide.

00:50:44.520 --> 00:50:45.972
So I'm not sure.

00:50:45.972 --> 00:50:47.180
That's not really a question.

00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.180
It's just a comment.

00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:51.040
BRIAN SWIMME: No, I very
much appreciate your comment.

00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:56.330
What I tell myself
is that I think

00:50:56.330 --> 00:50:59.570
the change in understanding
that's taking place

00:50:59.570 --> 00:51:02.660
is way bigger than the
Copernican revolution.

00:51:02.660 --> 00:51:04.270
It's way, way huger.

00:51:04.270 --> 00:51:08.250
And that required-- if
you go from Copernicus

00:51:08.250 --> 00:51:12.160
up to Isaac Newton,
that was 144 years.

00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:17.270
And so I think that
the changeover point

00:51:17.270 --> 00:51:21.080
for us in terms of the story
was 1964, when we discovered

00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:23.120
the background radiation.

00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:26.240
And so had realized, wow, we
really do have a new view.

00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:31.920
So 1964, we have
144 years from 1964.

00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.749
So we're in the middle of it.

00:51:34.749 --> 00:51:35.540
That's why I do it.

00:51:35.540 --> 00:51:37.415
I tell myself that we're
in the middle of it,

00:51:37.415 --> 00:51:42.330
and so we have to be patient
with ourselves and one another.

00:51:42.330 --> 00:51:44.770
Again, thanks so
much for coming.

00:51:44.770 --> 00:51:47.520
