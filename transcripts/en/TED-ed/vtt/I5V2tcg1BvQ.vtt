00:00:13.554 --> 00:00:19.034
You roll out of bed and leap eight meters 
across your underground habitat.

00:00:19.034 --> 00:00:23.334
The greywater from your sink
drains into a small greenhouse

00:00:23.334 --> 00:00:25.748
where your vegetables grow.

00:00:25.748 --> 00:00:27.605
After suiting up,

00:00:27.605 --> 00:00:31.704
you head through a transport 
chute to inspect the generator.

00:00:31.704 --> 00:00:37.761
Outside, it’s pitch black - just as 
it’s been for the last 12 days.

00:00:37.761 --> 00:00:47.456
This isn’t some post-apocalyptic scenario;
it’s just another day of life on the moon.

00:00:47.456 --> 00:00:50.084
And with the European Space Agency’s idea

00:00:50.084 --> 00:00:53.853
to establish a functioning 
"moon camp" by the 2020s,

00:00:53.853 --> 00:00:57.745
that day may be
closer than we think.

00:00:57.745 --> 00:01:00.246
Of course, living on 
the moon won’t be easy.

00:01:00.246 --> 00:01:05.185
The camp envisioned is not so much
a village as an inhabited research base

00:01:05.185 --> 00:01:08.726
similar to those 
in places like Antarctica.

00:01:08.726 --> 00:01:13.405
But there are far greater obstacles to
living on the moon than just cold weather.

00:01:13.405 --> 00:01:16.294
The biggest is cosmic radiation.

00:01:16.294 --> 00:01:21.092
Unlike the Earth, the moon has 
no atmosphere and no magnetic field.

00:01:21.092 --> 00:01:27.372
A person on its surface can receive 
over 400 times the maximum safe dosage

00:01:27.372 --> 00:01:29.995
of heavy ion radiation,

00:01:29.995 --> 00:01:34.596
enough to be fatal within ten hours, 
even in a spacesuit.

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:36.893
The first step would likely involve robots

00:01:36.893 --> 00:01:41.216
and 3D printers constructing 
covered habitats from lunar soil,

00:01:41.216 --> 00:01:43.526
or building shelters inside caves

00:01:43.526 --> 00:01:47.477
formed by lava tubes 
from the moon’s volcanic past.

00:01:47.477 --> 00:01:50.166
But what would the inhabitants live on?

00:01:50.166 --> 00:01:53.608
Supplies would need to be transported 
from Earth at first.

00:01:53.608 --> 00:01:58.246
Growing plants requires greenhouse soil 
and air rich in carbon dioxide,

00:01:58.246 --> 00:02:00.608
a gas that’s rare on the moon,

00:02:00.608 --> 00:02:03.844
but could be synthesized 
from recycled materials.

00:02:03.844 --> 00:02:08.562
A water treatment plant could be supplied 
by ice mined from the polar regions

00:02:08.562 --> 00:02:13.637
using a specialized drill that can bore 
two meters beneath the lunar surface.

00:02:13.637 --> 00:02:18.697
Friendly bacteria and viruses necessary 
to the human microbiome and immune system

00:02:18.697 --> 00:02:23.177
would also have to be imported 
or synthesized on site.

00:02:23.177 --> 00:02:26.616
And lunar inhabitants would have 
to exercise for hours a day

00:02:26.616 --> 00:02:29.474
to maintain bone and muscle mass.

00:02:29.474 --> 00:02:33.495
That’s because the moon’s gravity 
is just one-sixth that of the Earth,

00:02:33.495 --> 00:02:35.985
and the everyday strain of working 
against gravity

00:02:35.985 --> 00:02:39.597
is part of what keeps our bodies healthy.

00:02:39.597 --> 00:02:42.165
It might seem strange to go 
to all this trouble

00:02:42.165 --> 00:02:45.694
to build a base on a dead rock 
we’ve already visited.

00:02:45.694 --> 00:02:50.587
But NASA’s Apollo missions only explored 
small portions of the moon.

00:02:50.587 --> 00:02:52.996
We’ve made many discoveries since then,

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:56.775
such as ice near the poles and particles 
of solar wind gases

00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:59.016
that date back billions of years.

00:02:59.016 --> 00:03:02.515
They collectively show that the moon 
has much more to teach us

00:03:02.515 --> 00:03:04.995
about the history of our solar system.

00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:08.596
A radio telescope on its far side could 
observe the cosmos,

00:03:08.596 --> 00:03:12.255
shielded from the Earth’s electromagnetic
interference.

00:03:12.255 --> 00:03:17.697
And the lunar surface is rich in minerals,
like silicon, aluminum, and magnesium,

00:03:17.697 --> 00:03:21.216
creating great economic 
potential for mining.

00:03:21.216 --> 00:03:26.288
But the biggest benefit of the moon camp 
may not lie on the moon but beyond it.

00:03:26.288 --> 00:03:30.698
With the nearest possibly habitable 
world light-years away,

00:03:30.698 --> 00:03:34.536
and the International Space Station 
to be retired in about a decade,

00:03:34.536 --> 00:03:37.316
a moon base would be our first foothold

00:03:37.316 --> 00:03:40.106
towards becoming 
an interplanetary species.

00:03:40.106 --> 00:03:42.814
And proposals such as 
the Deep Space Gateway

00:03:42.814 --> 00:03:46.626
envision launching future 
missions from lunar orbit.

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:50.486
The smaller gravitational pull 
would require less fuel to overcome,

00:03:50.486 --> 00:03:54.005
allowing for larger ships and more cargo.

00:03:54.005 --> 00:03:57.649
Meanwhile, the base on the surface 
could serve as a testing ground

00:03:57.649 --> 00:03:59.795
for future space operations,

00:03:59.795 --> 00:04:01.035
a refueling station,

00:04:01.035 --> 00:04:04.774
and a supply depot all in one.

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:09.015
With Europe, Russia, China, and the US 
expressing interest in the project,

00:04:09.015 --> 00:04:11.265
the moon camp may come to involve

00:04:11.265 --> 00:04:15.574
the space agencies of all major nations, 
as well as private companies.

00:04:15.574 --> 00:04:16.666
Within a few decades,

00:04:16.666 --> 00:04:19.355
the moon may be bustling 
with mining operations,

00:04:19.355 --> 00:04:20.524
research stations,

00:04:20.524 --> 00:04:22.306
and tourist routes

00:04:22.306 --> 00:04:25.796
alongside a construction yard 
under an orbiting space port.

00:04:25.796 --> 00:04:27.976
We may have already visited the moon,

00:04:27.976 --> 00:04:31.694
but now we’re closer than ever 
to making it part of humanity’s home.
