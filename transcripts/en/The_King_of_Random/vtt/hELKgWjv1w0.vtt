If you're at a party this summer and wanna grab someones attention, you could try charming

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:08.500
the crowd with an improvised pan flute, or
you could go for a more direct approach.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.580
In this project, we're turning bottle caps and
drink cans, into sports-style party whistles,

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:17.539
that'll give you the power you need, to
summon the attention you deserve

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:29.480
We’re all familiar with the term “lifehacks”
but this summer, the guys at mike’s hard

00:00:29.489 --> 00:00:33.980
lemonade asked me to help put a refreshing
twist on it with what they’re calling “mikehacks"

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:38.380
"Mikehack" basically a lifehack that makes any social
occasion, more awesome.

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.990
I tried hot gluing some glass bottles together,
and found that yes, they really can work as

00:00:42.990 --> 00:00:48.310
a pan flute. It's a pretty awesome idea, but
can be pretty messy and take up a lot of space. So

00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.440
let's try making another kind of party favor,
that's just as awesome, but a little easier

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.540
to manage. We'll need to start this project
with an empty aluminum drink can. Now if we

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:01.829
use something like a pair of scissors to make
some strategic cuts, we can harvest a lightweight

00:01:01.829 --> 00:01:06.420
sheet of aluminum metal. Now before you throw
the scraps away, make sure you save a tab

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:09.380
or two, because we'll need those for measurements,
in just a minute.

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:13.060
Alright, let's cut a long narrow strip from
the sheet metal, making sure the edges are

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:17.770
as straight as possible, then cut a smaller,
stubbier piece as well. You can see the long

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:22.789
strip is the width of a single can tab, while
the smaller piece is as wide, and as tall,

00:01:22.789 --> 00:01:27.039
as two pieces laid side by side.
We need to join these pieces together with

00:01:27.039 --> 00:01:31.289
the smaller rectangle centered on top, about
a quarter inch down from the end. The two

00:01:31.289 --> 00:01:35.649
sides wrap around the back holding it in place,
and now you can snip the top corners off,

00:01:35.649 --> 00:01:40.369
if you feel like it, and finish up by folding
the tab over to lock everything together.

00:01:40.369 --> 00:01:44.109
We've just formed the mouthpiece for our whistle.
Now let's grab the other end of the strip

00:01:44.109 --> 00:01:48.380
and push it back through the mouth piece,
being careful not to bend it. You'll see what

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:52.249
we're going to do with this, in just a minute.
Alright, it's time to get busy with our bottle

00:01:52.249 --> 00:01:56.549
caps. I tried using a pair of scissors to
snip the sides, and cut a little notch in

00:01:56.549 --> 00:02:00.889
each cap, so when the two bottoms are lined
up, they form a round container with a symmetrical

00:02:00.889 --> 00:02:03.789
hole at the top.
Let's bring back the piece we made earlier

00:02:03.789 --> 00:02:08.060
and fit the barrel inside one of the caps,
then expand it so it completely fills the

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:12.190
inside. Now that we know it fits together
nicely, we can line the inside of the cap

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.470
with some hot-glue, then place the rounded
strip back in position.

00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:18.300
When the glue has hardened, it should look
like this.

00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.110
Now this is the point where we form the noise
maker. Carefully cut the strip so it lines

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.180
up with the top of the notch, then pull the
scrap part out of the mouthpiece.

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:31.240
There's only one thing left to do, and that's to add
hot-glue to the other cap, and press the two

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:36.660
pieces firmly together, making sure the notches
line up symmetrically. Now for one last embellishment,

00:02:36.660 --> 00:02:40.470
I tried cutting one of the tabs in half, and
hot-gluing it to the back, so now we have

00:02:40.470 --> 00:02:44.900
the option of adding a lanyard. That'll just
make it fully accessible, anytime we want it.

00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:47.120
The whistle works by directing air through

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:51.140
the mouthpiece, and splitting it over the
sharp edge of the metal. Not only does it

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.870
look good, but it actually sounds good too.
If you try rolling your tongue when you blow,

00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:59.330
it'll sound a lot like a referee's whistle,
and it's really, really loud.

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:06.880
Well now you know how to convert your cans and bottle caps, into colorful and customizable party whistles,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:10.790
that'll summon you attention when you need
it, and make a great conversation piece when

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:14.810
you don't. Well that's it for now. If you
liked this project, perhaps you'll like some

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:18.310
of my others. Check them out at www.thekingofrandom.com
