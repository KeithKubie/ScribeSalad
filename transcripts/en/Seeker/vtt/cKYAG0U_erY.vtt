00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:02.679
TRACE: When a man and a woman love each other
very much…

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:07.149
CRYSTAL: Her body takes a small piece of his
DNA and something completely destroys any

00:00:07.149 --> 00:00:09.570
evidence of its presence!

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:14.849
CRYSTAL: Hey DNews!

00:00:14.849 --> 00:00:16.869
Crystal and Trace here, thanks for stopping
by!

00:00:16.869 --> 00:00:21.410
So, you probably know the basics: sperm meets
egg, fertilization occurs, and the father’s

00:00:21.410 --> 00:00:25.390
DNA in the lucky sperm is combined with the
mother’s in her egg to complete the set

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:27.170
of 46 chromosomes needed to make a human.

00:00:27.170 --> 00:00:31.920
TRACE: But that's just chromosomal DNA, humans
and most animals have a little more DNA than

00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:34.160
just what's contained in our chromosomes...

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:37.340
CRYSTAL: It's true that chromosomal DNA is
the big famous one.

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:41.320
It's folded into chromosomes, stored in the
cell nucleus, and contains almost all the

00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:43.030
directions for how to make a human.

00:00:43.030 --> 00:00:44.030
Almost!

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:47.830
TRACE: We also have mitochondrial DNA, which
contain a few instructions on how to make

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.250
very specialized, proteins.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.540
CRYSTAL: Mitochondria are little sub-compartments
inside the cell, but outside the nucleus.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.730
They're the powerhouse of the cell, and are
responsible for producing energy that keeps

00:00:57.730 --> 00:00:58.730
cells alive.

00:00:58.730 --> 00:01:00.350
But they also contain this DNA.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.791
Mitochondrial DNA is circular, and shorter
than chromosomal DNA.

00:01:03.791 --> 00:01:08.650
The mitochondria are special not just because
they have their own tiny genome, but because

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:10.690
they can only be inherited from your mother.

00:01:10.690 --> 00:01:14.940
TRACE: Which is weird, because dude's cells
definitely have mitochondria.

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.180
Without the energy male mitochondria provide
sperm, they couldn't swim all that way.

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:23.810
But, after they contact the egg: POOF, the
mtDNA it's nowhere to be found!

00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:26.000
It's a huge biological mystery.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:31.030
The paternal mitochondrial DNA never enters
the egg, but its chromosomal DNA does.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.740
Where's all the mtDNA from your pops?

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:37.050
CRYSTAL: Well, the Case of the Disappearing
DNA has lots of twists and turns.

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:40.690
Scientists hypothesized that lysosomes in
the egg were attacking paternal DNA, leading

00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.690
to degradation.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:45.810
Lysosomes are the cell’s waste disposal
system, sub compartments of the cell that

00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:50.310
are spherical packages of killer enzymes to
cut up and destroy proteins and DNA.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:53.020
TRACE: They sound dangerous, and they're not
the whole story.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:57.940
Earlier studies also showed that mitochondria
in sperm carry specific signals that might

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:00.990
mark them for death even before they started
swimming for their lives.

00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:04.880
CRYSTAL: But, this month, researchers in China
published a report in the journal Science

00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:09.630
that suggests the paternal mitochondria have
a self-destruct mechanism that activates during

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:10.630
fertilization.

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:12.700
TRACE: Yep, they might do it to themselves.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:17.370
That means all of the mitochondria in all
humans today is from the mother, and thus

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:22.040
can be traced back to one common female ancestor,
scientists call this person “mitochondrial

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:23.040
Eve”.

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:26.709
CRYSTAL: When researchers examined paternal
mitochondria using an electron microscope

00:02:26.709 --> 00:02:30.270
they found that instead of the father’s
mitochondria being destroyed by mechanisms

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:34.390
within the egg, the mitochondria began to
decompose on their own!

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:37.980
They found that an enzyme, CPS-6, was responsible
for this degradation.

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:42.470
TRACE: Essentially, mitochondria from the
Dad are depolarized and damaged internally

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:46.270
soon after fertilization, this leads to the
release of that CPS-6.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.840
CRYSTAL: Which then starts chewing up the
mitochondrial DNA and then lysosomes from

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.360
the egg move in for the kill.

00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:54.700
TRACE: As you can imagine this was a shock.

00:02:54.700 --> 00:02:55.700
CRYSTAL: Yeah!

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:59.620
Basically, every sperm's mitochondria is on
a suicide mission!

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:03.630
TRACE: *plays taps*

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:07.580
CRYSTAL: Why would evolution only select for
maternal mtDNA?

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:09.290
How is that an advantage?

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:10.290
TRACE: DISEASE!

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:13.380
See, mitochondrial DNA could be used to help
us overcome genetic diseases…

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.980

three genetic parents, check out this video

00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.950

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:31.130
Are you sad about your mitochondria, now that
you know them so well?

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:40.799
Have a science question you want us to tackle?
