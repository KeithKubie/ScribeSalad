00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:02.730
What I want to do in this
video is to give you an

00:00:02.730 --> 00:00:08.470
intuitive sense of how a market
for currencies would

00:00:08.470 --> 00:00:09.180
actually work.

00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:11.500
And it's very non-inuitive for
a lot of people because we're

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.390
going to be talking about
currencies becoming more

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:19.230
expensive or cheaper, or the
price of a currency in terms

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:19.800
of another one.

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:20.900
And what I want to do
is give you a very

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:22.390
intuitive feel for that.

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:27.280
So let's say, just because this
is a hot topic right now,

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:29.470
let's just make the two
currencies the Chinese

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.180
renminbi and the U.S. dollar.

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:35.470
And the unit of exchange in
China is a little confusing

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:37.410
because sometimes they use the
word renminbi and sometimes

00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:38.260
the word yuan.

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.520
The yuan is the unit
of the renminbi.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:45.460
So let's say right now, if
I were to just go on some

00:00:45.460 --> 00:00:48.400
website-- and this is not the
actual exchange rate right

00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:52.990
now, but let's say right now the
quoted exchange rate is 10

00:00:52.990 --> 00:00:57.530
yuan per U.S. dollar.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:01:01.710
10 yuan is equal to $1.

00:01:01.710 --> 00:01:03.690
And every time I say dollar in
this video, I'm referring to

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:04.940
the U.S. dollar.

00:01:07.330 --> 00:01:09.490
And I think this makes sense to
a lot of people, if I have

00:01:09.490 --> 00:01:13.030
$1, I want to convert it to
yuan, I get 10 of them.

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:15.390
If I have 10 yuan, I want to
convert it to dollars,

00:01:15.390 --> 00:01:17.910
someone's going to give
me a dollar for it.

00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:20.670
Now let's imagine a situation,
and in the next few videos

00:01:20.670 --> 00:01:24.980
I'll construct actual trade
imbalances where this would

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:30.340
actually happen, but let's say
we live in a reality where

00:01:30.340 --> 00:01:31.790
there are 1,000 yuan.

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:48.250
So let's say someone has
1,000 yuan and wants

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:49.500
to convert to dollars.

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.980
Now, let's say on this side, and
if we just superficially

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:05.300
looked at this 1,000 yuan and
looked at the quoted rate,

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:08.070
we'd say, hey, that 1,000 yuan,
you get 10 yuan per

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:11.980
dollar, so that should be
$100 at the quoted rate.

00:02:11.980 --> 00:02:13.940
Let's say you have two other
actors over here, and

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:16.100
obviously these markets involve
many, many, more than

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.450
just the three people, but this
will help us simplify, or

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:22.600
at least understand how these
exchange rates would work.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.100
Let's say that this person right
here with the mustache

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:48.030
and maybe a hat as well, let's
say that he has $100 that he

00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:56.160
needs to convert to yuan.

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:59.230
Maybe he wants to buy some
Chinese goods, maybe he's a

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.110
Chinese factory owner who sold
his goods in the U.S. for $100

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:05.630
and now he needs to convert
it back to yuan to pay his

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.660
employees or pay his own
mortgage or who knows what.

00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:16.340
And let's say that there's
another person, and let's say

00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:32.730
that she also has $100
that needs to be

00:03:32.730 --> 00:03:37.920
converted into yuan.

00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.310
So net, what's happening here?

00:03:39.310 --> 00:03:42.620
What's the total demand to
convert yuan into dollars, and

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:43.560
dollars into yuan?

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.670
Well, if you look at the whole
market, you have $200 that

00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:48.550
needed to be converted
into yuan.

00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:50.110
Let me write this down.

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:58.410
We have a situation where
$200 needs to be

00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:04.560
converted into yuan.

00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:09.050
And then, on the other side of
that transaction, we have

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:12.690
1,000 yuan that needs to be
converted into dollars.

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:29.650
So now we have 1,000 yuan.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.590
And for simplicity, these
are the only actors.

00:04:32.590 --> 00:04:35.370
They are representing the entire
market, although, as we

00:04:35.370 --> 00:04:40.620
know, in currency markets
especially there's thousands

00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:43.170
or even millions of
actors actively

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:44.370
participating in them.

00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:45.660
So what's going to happen?

00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.870
All of these people might just
go on the internet and look up

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:52.240
the current exchange rate,
or the last exchange that

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:56.270
occurred and say, hey this
$100, I should be able to

00:04:56.270 --> 00:04:58.460
convert it into $1,000 yuan.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:01.440
But she also says, I should be
able to convert this $100 into

00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:04.330
1,000 yuan, so they collectively
think that that

00:05:04.330 --> 00:05:07.940
$200 can be converted
into 2,000 yuan.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:10.110
I'll put this in
question marks.

00:05:10.110 --> 00:05:16.450
So will they be able to convert
this into 2,000 yuan?

00:05:16.450 --> 00:05:19.440
And this person over here, you
know, he's saying just at the

00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:24.270
current exchange rate, maybe
I'll be able to get-- for my

00:05:24.270 --> 00:05:26.040
1,000 yuan, maybe
I'll get $100.

00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.950
But everyone wants to maximize
the amount of the other

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.530
currency they get for
obvious reasons.

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:32.990
They want to maximize the amount
of money they get.

00:05:32.990 --> 00:05:36.650
Now, will these two people be
able to convert their money

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:37.720
into 2,000 yuan?

00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:40.280
Remember what I said, this is
the entire market, and it's a

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:43.900
huge simplification, but there
is this imbalance here.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:46.140
More dollars into yuan than
yuan into dollars.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.240
Now they won't be able to
convert into 2,000 yuan

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:50.700
because there's only 1,000 yuan
that wants to be traded.

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.970
So you can imagine, this guy
over here, maybe he wants to

00:05:57.970 --> 00:06:00.790
do it slowly just to kind of see
what the market is like.

00:06:00.790 --> 00:06:05.460
So let's say at first
he puts 10 yuan up,

00:06:05.460 --> 00:06:06.810
essentially for a bid.

00:06:06.810 --> 00:06:08.730
You could view it either way,
you could say that maybe one

00:06:08.730 --> 00:06:11.920
of these people put $1 up for
bid, and this guy's bidding on

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.310
the dollar in terms of yuan, or
this guy's putting yuan up

00:06:15.310 --> 00:06:19.400
for bid and these guys are going
to bid on it in terms of

00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:21.080
dollars, either one.

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.280
And that's why it's sometimes
confusing with currencies,

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.760
because you're buying
another currency.

00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:32.510
But since this guy is more in
demand, to simplify things

00:06:32.510 --> 00:06:36.080
I'll make him the person that's
kind of able to create

00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.610
an auction-type situation.

00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:41.310
Which really is what the markets
are trying to do, so

00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:44.000
that you can equalize
supply and demand.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:52.380
So he might initially say he has
$100 yuan and he wants to

00:06:52.380 --> 00:06:53.940
convert it, so he says,
you know what?

00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:58.170
I'm willing to sell
100 yuan for $10.

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.230
So let's say he sells
100 yuan for $10.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:14.050
so he sells 100-- or offers I
should say, offers to sell 100

00:07:14.050 --> 00:07:20.020
yuan for $10, and he just thinks
that that's a fair

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:21.810
offer price right over there.

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:25.240
And that's this guy over here,
this guy actually converting

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.310
yuan into dollars.

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:27.570
Well, what's going to happen?

00:07:27.570 --> 00:07:29.980
Well one of these people is just
going to jump at that and

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.950
say oh, you know what, I think
that's a fair price.

00:07:31.950 --> 00:07:35.190
And so let's say this woman
right over here takes it.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:38.340
Actually both of them maybe
saw that offer to sell 100

00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:41.120
yuan for $10, and they both try
to click their mouse or

00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.290
however they're trying to make
the transaction happen.

00:07:43.290 --> 00:07:45.750
But let's say she clicks her
mouse a little faster and she

00:07:45.750 --> 00:07:47.590
gets the transaction.

00:07:47.590 --> 00:07:52.440
So let's say that person, let's
call this person B.

00:07:52.440 --> 00:07:56.330
And this is person A and
this is person C.

00:07:56.330 --> 00:07:59.280
So person B accepts.

00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.360
So two things happen just then:
One is, person C says,

00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:10.200
wow that was pretty fast,
someone was very willing to

00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:15.400
take it for 10 yuan per U.S.
dollar and this guy goes, my

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:17.400
god, I need to convert my
money into yuan, but

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:18.170
I wasn't able to.

00:08:18.170 --> 00:08:19.920
Someone else beat
me to the punch.

00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:23.530
So this guy over here is like
hey, maybe people are willing

00:08:23.530 --> 00:08:26.710
to give me more dollars
per yuan.

00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:29.860
So let's say that this guy right
over here-- this guy in

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:39.860
orange-- he then offers to sell,
let's say he wants to

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:46.670
sell 90 yuan for $10.

00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:51.100
Notice the price of the yuan has
now gone up, or the price

00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:53.560
of the dollar has now gone
down, either one.

00:08:53.560 --> 00:08:55.950
Those symmetric statements,
they mean

00:08:55.950 --> 00:08:57.920
the exact same thing.

00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:01.270
So all of a sudden, this person
has a lot of dollars he

00:09:01.270 --> 00:09:04.370
needs to convert into yuan, so
he accepts really fast, so

00:09:04.370 --> 00:09:05.710
person A accepts.

00:09:05.710 --> 00:09:07.590
I'm doing a huge
oversimplication, but it gives

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:09.010
you the general idea
to show you that

00:09:09.010 --> 00:09:10.690
this really is a market.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:13.960
So person A accepts.

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.720
All of a sudden, we have a
new quoted exchange rate.

00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.050
We all of a sudden have an
exchange rate of what is this,

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:26.120
9 yuan, so we have a new quoted
rate or the transaction

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:33.820
happens at 9 yuan per dollar.

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:34.550
Now what's happening?

00:09:34.550 --> 00:09:37.370
I think you see the dynamic
that's going to happen.

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:41.610
There's more dollars that need
to be converted into yuan then

00:09:41.610 --> 00:09:44.170
yuan that needs to be converted
into dollars.

00:09:44.170 --> 00:09:47.420
So this guy actually sees
there's a lot of demand to get

00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:49.030
his 1,000 yuan.

00:09:49.030 --> 00:09:51.030
He's going to keep offering
fewer and

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:53.140
fewer yuan per dollar.

00:09:53.140 --> 00:09:57.470
Or, these guys are going to
start accepting fewer and

00:09:57.470 --> 00:10:00.430
fewer yuan for each
of their dollars.

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:04.060
So as this happens, as the price
of the yuan will go up.

00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:06.240
Notice, the price of the
yuan went up here.

00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:09.320
It was 10 yuan per dollar, now
it's 9 yuan per dollar.

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:12.090
Or you could say the price of
the dollar has gone down.

00:10:12.090 --> 00:10:14.450
And this will just keep
happening until all of them

00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:17.600
are able to get rid
of their currency.

00:10:17.600 --> 00:10:19.510
There's no mathematical formula
to say what the

00:10:19.510 --> 00:10:21.870
clearing price is, it's actually
dependent on how

00:10:21.870 --> 00:10:24.820
badly each of these people are
willing to transact and really

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.830
how good they are at
gaming each other.

00:10:26.830 --> 00:10:29.810
But the general result here,
and this is kind of what I

00:10:29.810 --> 00:10:34.660
really want you to get from this
video, is that because

00:10:34.660 --> 00:10:38.910
there's no law in a market
exchange rate mechanism that

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.800
says this has to be the exchange
rate-- we'll explore

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:44.530
how you can peg it in the
future-- but there's nothing

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.710
that says that this has
to always be the case.

00:10:46.710 --> 00:10:49.680
If there's more demand for yuan
then dollars, as we see

00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:52.945
in this example, the price of
the dollar will go down.

00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:13.870
Which means the exact same thing
as the price of yuan

00:11:13.870 --> 00:11:14.790
will go up.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.640
I really want you to
internalize this.

00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:22.150
It will go up in terms of
dollars, price of dollars, in

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:24.100
terms of yuan will go down.

00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:26.060
And this is the crux of
foreign exchange.

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.100
If you can at least internalize
these ideas and to

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:32.850
understand that there really is
this market out here based

00:11:32.850 --> 00:11:34.840
on the supply and
demand of yuan.

00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.690
Over here, the demand for yuan
is exceeding its supply.

00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:42.220
So price will go up.

00:11:42.220 --> 00:11:45.490
Or you can view it the other
way, the demand for dollars is

00:11:45.490 --> 00:11:49.150
below its supply, so the
price will go down.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:51.390
Anyway, I'll let you think about
that for a little bit.

00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:54.140
In the next video, we're going
to apply this concept to see

00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:58.120
how this freely floating
exchange rate can help

00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:01.210
equalize, or should help
equalize trade imbalances in

00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:03.120
an ideal world.
