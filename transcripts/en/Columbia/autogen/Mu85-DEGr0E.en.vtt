government is supposed to make up for
 

00:15:35.119 --> 00:15:37.199
government is supposed to make up for
the deficiency in the private sector in

00:15:37.199 --> 00:15:37.209
the deficiency in the private sector in
 

00:15:37.209 --> 00:15:40.899
the deficiency in the private sector in
fact government has been exacerbating

00:15:40.899 --> 00:15:40.909
fact government has been exacerbating
 

00:15:40.909 --> 00:15:43.629
fact government has been exacerbating
the problem and unfortunately the

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:43.639
the problem and unfortunately the
 

00:15:43.639 --> 00:15:45.039
the problem and unfortunately the
politics and uniting stakes are not

00:15:45.039 --> 00:15:45.049
politics and uniting stakes are not
 

00:15:45.049 --> 00:15:49.299
politics and uniting stakes are not
likely to make this to reverse this the

00:15:49.299 --> 00:15:49.309
likely to make this to reverse this the
 

00:15:49.309 --> 00:15:51.069
likely to make this to reverse this the
real risk is that it will get actually

00:15:51.069 --> 00:15:51.079
real risk is that it will get actually
 

00:15:51.079 --> 00:15:56.169
real risk is that it will get actually
worse so this problem of unemployment

00:15:56.169 --> 00:15:56.179
worse so this problem of unemployment
 

00:15:56.179 --> 00:15:59.049
worse so this problem of unemployment
and therefore of youth unemployment is

00:15:59.049 --> 00:15:59.059
and therefore of youth unemployment is
 

00:15:59.059 --> 00:16:03.599
and therefore of youth unemployment is
going to be with us for I think sometime

00:16:03.599 --> 00:16:03.609
going to be with us for I think sometime
 

00:16:03.609 --> 00:16:05.799

and it won't last that long so the the

00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:36.130
and it won't last that long so the the
 

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:38.490

years are this this this will last quite

years are this this this will last quite
 

00:17:41.559 --> 00:17:47.130
years are this this this will last quite
as long but uh the the it will take a

00:17:47.130 --> 00:17:47.140
as long but uh the the it will take a
 

00:17:47.140 --> 00:17:50.539
as long but uh the the it will take a
long time and that's why it's more than

00:17:50.539 --> 00:17:50.549
long time and that's why it's more than
 

00:17:50.549 --> 00:17:53.700
long time and that's why it's more than
deleveraging that's at stake even after

even if we grow it won't be enough to it

even if we grow it won't be enough to it
 

00:18:16.870 --> 00:18:21.600
even if we grow it won't be enough to it
to really reverse the problems so that's

00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:21.610
to really reverse the problems so that's
 

00:18:21.610 --> 00:18:23.460

that there has been such problems in job

00:20:02.419 --> 00:20:02.429
that there has been such problems in job

even if output is going up up very

will I think be a movement from China to
 

00:21:06.510 --> 00:21:09.950
will I think be a movement from China to
other countries in manufacturing but

other countries in manufacturing but

detail is the issue of aspirations of

detail is the issue of aspirations of
 

00:22:37.110 --> 00:22:39.830
detail is the issue of aspirations of
what kinds of jobs that people seek and

00:22:39.830 --> 00:22:39.840
what kinds of jobs that people seek and
 

00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:42.590
what kinds of jobs that people seek and
that's a real problem in in many

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:42.600
that's a real problem in in many
 

00:22:42.600 --> 00:22:44.570
that's a real problem in in many
countries in Middle East but all in

00:22:44.570 --> 00:22:44.580
countries in Middle East but all in
 

00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:49.760
countries in Middle East but all in
other other air places where you see it

00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:49.770
other other air places where you see it
 

00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:51.860
other other air places where you see it
very vividly in these countries where

00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:51.870
very vividly in these countries where
 

00:22:51.870 --> 00:22:57.110
very vividly in these countries where
you have high unemployment but at the

00:22:57.110 --> 00:22:57.120
you have high unemployment but at the
 

00:22:57.120 --> 00:23:00.910
you have high unemployment but at the
same time large immigrant populations

00:23:00.910 --> 00:23:00.920
same time large immigrant populations
 

00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:06.440
same time large immigrant populations
you have economies where there are jobs

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:06.450
you have economies where there are jobs
 

00:23:06.450 --> 00:23:09.980
you have economies where there are jobs
but the people in the country don't want

00:23:09.980 --> 00:23:09.990
but the people in the country don't want
 

00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:12.260
but the people in the country don't want
those jobs and they asked people from

00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:12.270
those jobs and they asked people from
 

00:23:12.270 --> 00:23:14.360
those jobs and they asked people from
other countries to take the jobs that

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:14.370
other countries to take the jobs that
 

00:23:14.370 --> 00:23:17.600
other countries to take the jobs that
they don't want so you have this this

00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:17.610
they don't want so you have this this
 

00:23:17.610 --> 00:23:22.130
they don't want so you have this this
mixture of economies with high levels of

00:23:22.130 --> 00:23:22.140
mixture of economies with high levels of
 

00:23:22.140 --> 00:23:24.610
mixture of economies with high levels of
unemployment and high levels of

00:23:24.610 --> 00:23:24.620
unemployment and high levels of
 

00:23:24.620 --> 00:23:29.090
unemployment and high levels of
immigrants coming in and then I think

00:23:29.090 --> 00:23:29.100
immigrants coming in and then I think
 

00:23:29.100 --> 00:23:32.870
immigrants coming in and then I think
has to do with aspirations of what are

00:23:32.870 --> 00:23:32.880
has to do with aspirations of what are
 

00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.550
has to do with aspirations of what are
viewed to be acceptable and good jobs

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:36.560
viewed to be acceptable and good jobs
 

00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:42.760
viewed to be acceptable and good jobs
and that problem goes back I think to

00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:42.770
and that problem goes back I think to
 

00:23:42.770 --> 00:23:46.760
and that problem goes back I think to
education not just well before the

00:23:46.760 --> 00:23:46.770
education not just well before the
 

00:23:46.770 --> 00:23:48.890
education not just well before the

00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:56.270
values some countries faced up to the
problem or at least begun to talk about

problem or at least begun to talk about
 

00:23:56.280 --> 00:23:58.910
problem or at least begun to talk about
it and realize that for instance that at

00:23:58.910 --> 00:23:58.920
it and realize that for instance that at
 

00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:01.760
it and realize that for instance that at
the elementary and middle and secondary

and that will probably be true you know

it will even in 20 years it will be

00:30:04.550 --> 00:30:04.560
context of high levels of unemployment
 

00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:09.230
context of high levels of unemployment
is that there's pressure for skill based

00:30:09.230 --> 00:30:09.240
is that there's pressure for skill based
 

00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:15.360
is that there's pressure for skill based
education and Columbia College augment

00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:15.370
education and Columbia College augment
 

00:30:15.370 --> 00:30:19.110
education and Columbia College augment
to amherst college these are schools

00:30:19.110 --> 00:30:19.120
to amherst college these are schools
 

00:30:19.120 --> 00:30:20.550
to amherst college these are schools
that have been committed to a liberal

00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:20.560
that have been committed to a liberal
 

00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:22.380
that have been committed to a liberal
arts education are very broad education

00:30:22.380 --> 00:30:22.390
arts education are very broad education
 

00:30:22.390 --> 00:30:25.260
arts education are very broad education
I believe that those kind of broad

00:30:25.260 --> 00:30:25.270
I believe that those kind of broad
 

00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:29.160
I believe that those kind of broad
education is very important for adapting

00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:29.170
education is very important for adapting
 

00:30:29.170 --> 00:30:33.060
education is very important for adapting
to a very quickly changing economy and

00:30:33.060 --> 00:30:33.070
to a very quickly changing economy and
 

00:30:33.070 --> 00:30:36.120
to a very quickly changing economy and
society but the students are typically

00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:36.130
society but the students are typically
 

00:30:36.130 --> 00:30:38.310
society but the students are typically
more sure excited they want the skills

00:30:38.310 --> 00:30:38.320
more sure excited they want the skills
 

00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:40.080
more sure excited they want the skills
to be able to get the jobs right away

00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:40.090
to be able to get the jobs right away
 

00:30:40.090 --> 00:30:43.230
to be able to get the jobs right away
and so I think one of our challenge will

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:43.240
and so I think one of our challenge will
 

00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.370
and so I think one of our challenge will
be to

00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:44.380
be to
 

00:30:44.380 --> 00:30:46.980
be to
to meet the demands of the students to

00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:46.990
to meet the demands of the students to
 

00:30:46.990 --> 00:30:49.830
to meet the demands of the students to
have skill based education but to do it

00:30:49.830 --> 00:30:49.840
have skill based education but to do it
 

00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:52.050
have skill based education but to do it
at the same time provided them with at

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:52.060
at the same time provided them with at
 

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.580
at the same time provided them with at
least a core of the liberal arts

00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:53.590
least a core of the liberal arts
 

00:30:53.590 --> 00:30:55.560
least a core of the liberal arts
education that has I think the

00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:55.570
education that has I think the
 

00:30:55.570 --> 00:31:07.640
education that has I think the
foundations of a long run success the

00:31:07.640 --> 00:31:07.650
 

00:31:07.650 --> 00:31:12.750
second broad issue that all of us are

00:31:12.750 --> 00:31:12.760
second broad issue that all of us are
 

00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:15.750
second broad issue that all of us are
going to be facing is that education is

00:31:15.750 --> 00:31:15.760
going to be facing is that education is
 

00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.190
going to be facing is that education is
a service sector and it's a high school

00:31:20.190 --> 00:31:20.200
a service sector and it's a high school
 

00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:24.990
a service sector and it's a high school
service sector wages the cost increase

00:31:24.990 --> 00:31:25.000
service sector wages the cost increase
 

00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.510
service sector wages the cost increase
faster than have been increasing in the

00:31:30.510 --> 00:31:30.520
faster than have been increasing in the
 

00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.950
faster than have been increasing in the
United States and many other countries

00:31:31.950 --> 00:31:31.960
United States and many other countries
 

00:31:31.960 --> 00:31:36.560
United States and many other countries
much faster than median income and

00:31:36.560 --> 00:31:36.570
much faster than median income and
 

00:31:36.570 --> 00:31:38.670
much faster than median income and
that's even worse than the United States

00:31:38.670 --> 00:31:38.680
that's even worse than the United States
 

00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:40.140
that's even worse than the United States
because public support has been

00:31:40.140 --> 00:31:40.150
because public support has been
 

00:31:40.150 --> 00:31:42.420
because public support has been
diminishing next also true in many

00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:42.430
diminishing next also true in many
 

00:31:42.430 --> 00:31:47.190
diminishing next also true in many
European countries that means that there

00:31:47.190 --> 00:31:47.200
European countries that means that there
 

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.700
European countries that means that there
is an increasing problem of accessing so

00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:50.710
is an increasing problem of accessing so
 

00:31:50.710 --> 00:31:54.450
is an increasing problem of accessing so
the cost of education is going up faster

00:31:54.450 --> 00:31:54.460
the cost of education is going up faster
 

00:31:54.460 --> 00:32:00.120
the cost of education is going up faster
than median income and that that means

00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:00.130
than median income and that that means
 

00:32:00.130 --> 00:32:04.200
than median income and that that means
that people at the bottom will have less

00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:04.210
that people at the bottom will have less
 

00:32:04.210 --> 00:32:07.320
that people at the bottom will have less
and less opportunity for getting the

00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:07.330
and less opportunity for getting the
 

00:32:07.330 --> 00:32:12.990
and less opportunity for getting the
education that they need well that books

00:32:12.990 --> 00:32:13.000
education that they need well that books
 

00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.920
education that they need well that books
a very heavy burden on universities to

00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:16.930
a very heavy burden on universities to
 

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:19.020
a very heavy burden on universities to
think about how they can control costs

00:32:19.020 --> 00:32:19.030
think about how they can control costs
 

00:32:19.030 --> 00:32:23.400
think about how they can control costs
and you know they try all variety of

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:23.410
and you know they try all variety of
 

00:32:23.410 --> 00:32:28.260
and you know they try all variety of
ways I think it's a major issue but

00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:28.270
ways I think it's a major issue but
 

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:31.620
ways I think it's a major issue but
basically the way we deliver education

00:32:31.620 --> 00:32:31.630
basically the way we deliver education
 

00:32:31.630 --> 00:32:35.610
basically the way we deliver education
hasn't changed a great deal and you know

00:32:35.610 --> 00:32:35.620
hasn't changed a great deal and you know
 

00:32:35.620 --> 00:32:37.320
hasn't changed a great deal and you know
the delivery of other products has

00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:37.330
the delivery of other products has
 

00:32:37.330 --> 00:32:40.260
the delivery of other products has
changed a lot but the delivery of

00:32:40.260 --> 00:32:40.270
changed a lot but the delivery of
 

00:32:40.270 --> 00:32:45.420
changed a lot but the delivery of
education hasn't now in some ways at the

00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:45.430
education hasn't now in some ways at the
 

00:32:45.430 --> 00:32:47.340
education hasn't now in some ways at the
core of successful education are the

00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:47.350
core of successful education are the
 

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.840
core of successful education are the
inner are the close personal

00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:48.850
inner are the close personal
 

00:32:48.850 --> 00:32:50.640
inner are the close personal
relationships between a teacher and the

00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:50.650
relationships between a teacher and the
 

00:32:50.650 --> 00:32:55.880
relationships between a teacher and the
students but one of the one of the

00:32:55.880 --> 00:32:55.890
students but one of the one of the
 

00:32:55.890 --> 00:32:57.919
students but one of the one of the
responses to

00:32:57.919 --> 00:32:57.929
responses to
 

00:32:57.929 --> 00:33:00.479
responses to
increase in cost is they have larger

00:33:00.479 --> 00:33:00.489
increase in cost is they have larger
 

00:33:00.489 --> 00:33:02.399
increase in cost is they have larger
classes which is of course undermining

00:33:02.399 --> 00:33:02.409
classes which is of course undermining
 

00:33:02.409 --> 00:33:06.629
classes which is of course undermining
that close relationship the second

00:33:06.629 --> 00:33:06.639
that close relationship the second
 

00:33:06.639 --> 00:33:09.060
that close relationship the second
problem is if we are going to be facing

00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:09.070
problem is if we are going to be facing
 

00:33:09.070 --> 00:33:12.299
problem is if we are going to be facing
the problem of access we want to be able

00:33:12.299 --> 00:33:12.309
the problem of access we want to be able
 

00:33:12.309 --> 00:33:15.060
the problem of access we want to be able
to take into our schools students of

00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:15.070
to take into our schools students of
 

00:33:15.070 --> 00:33:19.169
to take into our schools students of
heterogeneous background and if we have

00:33:19.169 --> 00:33:19.179
heterogeneous background and if we have
 

00:33:19.179 --> 00:33:22.649
heterogeneous background and if we have
large classes that will become let we

00:33:22.649 --> 00:33:22.659
large classes that will become let we
 

00:33:22.659 --> 00:33:25.769
large classes that will become let we
would be less successful in providing

00:33:25.769 --> 00:33:25.779
would be less successful in providing
 

00:33:25.779 --> 00:33:27.659
would be less successful in providing
education it's not just a question of

00:33:27.659 --> 00:33:27.669
education it's not just a question of
 

00:33:27.669 --> 00:33:30.060
education it's not just a question of
admitting them it's actually making sure

00:33:30.060 --> 00:33:30.070
admitting them it's actually making sure
 

00:33:30.070 --> 00:33:31.859
admitting them it's actually making sure
that we can deliver an education that is

00:33:31.859 --> 00:33:31.869
that we can deliver an education that is
 

00:33:31.869 --> 00:33:36.690
that we can deliver an education that is
responsive to their backgrounds so what

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:36.700
responsive to their backgrounds so what
 

00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:39.359
responsive to their backgrounds so what
I think we have to do is to think a lot

00:33:39.359 --> 00:33:39.369
I think we have to do is to think a lot
 

00:33:39.369 --> 00:33:42.719
I think we have to do is to think a lot
more about the structuring our education

00:33:42.719 --> 00:33:42.729
more about the structuring our education
 

00:33:42.729 --> 00:33:46.319
more about the structuring our education
so as an example I think schools like

00:33:46.319 --> 00:33:46.329
so as an example I think schools like
 

00:33:46.329 --> 00:33:49.649
so as an example I think schools like
Columbia amorz need to have many more

00:33:49.649 --> 00:33:49.659
Columbia amorz need to have many more
 

00:33:49.659 --> 00:33:52.859
Columbia amorz need to have many more
smaller classes the first two years to

00:33:52.859 --> 00:33:52.869
smaller classes the first two years to
 

00:33:52.869 --> 00:33:55.229
smaller classes the first two years to
adapt to be able to deliver the kind of

00:33:55.229 --> 00:33:55.239
adapt to be able to deliver the kind of
 

00:33:55.239 --> 00:33:58.859
adapt to be able to deliver the kind of
education necessary for a heterogeneous

00:33:58.859 --> 00:33:58.869
education necessary for a heterogeneous
 

00:33:58.869 --> 00:34:03.749
education necessary for a heterogeneous
population coming in but then we have to

00:34:03.749 --> 00:34:03.759
population coming in but then we have to
 

00:34:03.759 --> 00:34:05.729
population coming in but then we have to
think about how we can use technology to

00:34:05.729 --> 00:34:05.739
think about how we can use technology to
 

00:34:05.739 --> 00:34:08.579
think about how we can use technology to
supplement some of the conventional

00:34:08.579 --> 00:34:08.589
supplement some of the conventional
 

00:34:08.589 --> 00:34:10.859
supplement some of the conventional
teaching and there have been big Vance's

00:34:10.859 --> 00:34:10.869
teaching and there have been big Vance's
 

00:34:10.869 --> 00:34:12.629
teaching and there have been big Vance's
and technology younger people what I

00:34:12.629 --> 00:34:12.639
and technology younger people what I
 

00:34:12.639 --> 00:34:14.519
and technology younger people what I
said before is younger people are used

00:34:14.519 --> 00:34:14.529
said before is younger people are used
 

00:34:14.529 --> 00:34:16.049
said before is younger people are used
to technology in a way that some of the

00:34:16.049 --> 00:34:16.059
to technology in a way that some of the
 

00:34:16.059 --> 00:34:19.139
to technology in a way that some of the
older you know we resist reading some of

00:34:19.139 --> 00:34:19.149
older you know we resist reading some of
 

00:34:19.149 --> 00:34:22.319
older you know we resist reading some of
us resist reading a newspaper and on the

00:34:22.319 --> 00:34:22.329
us resist reading a newspaper and on the
 

00:34:22.329 --> 00:34:27.389
us resist reading a newspaper and on the
Kindle young people they don't like

00:34:27.389 --> 00:34:27.399
Kindle young people they don't like
 

00:34:27.399 --> 00:34:30.419
Kindle young people they don't like
paper and it's good for their forest

00:34:30.419 --> 00:34:30.429
paper and it's good for their forest
 

00:34:30.429 --> 00:34:34.109
paper and it's good for their forest
besides but but the they are much more

00:34:34.109 --> 00:34:34.119
besides but but the they are much more
 

00:34:34.119 --> 00:34:41.879
besides but but the they are much more
adaptive to these new technologies so it

00:34:41.879 --> 00:34:41.889
adaptive to these new technologies so it
 

00:34:41.889 --> 00:34:45.720
adaptive to these new technologies so it
seems to me that as we focus on cost

00:34:45.720 --> 00:34:45.730
seems to me that as we focus on cost
 

00:34:45.730 --> 00:34:49.799
seems to me that as we focus on cost
focus on efficiency focus on the

00:34:49.799 --> 00:34:49.809
focus on efficiency focus on the
 

00:34:49.809 --> 00:34:52.289
focus on efficiency focus on the
importance of access I think we need to

00:34:52.289 --> 00:34:52.299
importance of access I think we need to
 

00:34:52.299 --> 00:34:55.289
importance of access I think we need to
re-examine the whole issue of the

00:34:55.289 --> 00:34:55.299
re-examine the whole issue of the
 

00:34:55.299 --> 00:34:59.039
re-examine the whole issue of the
delivery of our education and we have to

00:34:59.039 --> 00:34:59.049
delivery of our education and we have to
 

00:34:59.049 --> 00:35:02.190
delivery of our education and we have to
agree examine the content as we as we

00:35:02.190 --> 00:35:02.200
agree examine the content as we as we
 

00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:07.559
agree examine the content as we as we
think about the the issue of designing

00:35:07.559 --> 00:35:07.569
think about the the issue of designing
 

00:35:07.569 --> 00:35:10.049
think about the the issue of designing
an education system that is good for

00:35:10.049 --> 00:35:10.059
an education system that is good for
 

00:35:10.059 --> 00:35:10.650
an education system that is good for
their

suffer from chronic budget deficits the
cut aggregate demand and also they

00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:29.890
cut aggregate demand and also they
 

00:36:29.890 --> 00:36:32.130

the answer is that that in Europe and

00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:58.210
the answer is that that in Europe and
 

00:36:58.210 --> 00:37:01.829
the answer is that that in Europe and
America today there is no scope for

00:37:01.829 --> 00:37:01.839
America today there is no scope for
 

00:37:01.839 --> 00:37:06.720
America today there is no scope for

times you can have this mix between

00:37:09.299 --> 00:37:09.309
times you can have this mix between
 

00:37:09.309 --> 00:37:12.000
times you can have this mix between
monetary and fiscal policy you can have

00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:12.010
monetary and fiscal policy you can have

fiscal contraction and monetary easing
and that can stimulate the economy right

00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:17.650
and that can stimulate the economy right
 

00:37:17.650 --> 00:37:21.670
and that can stimulate the economy right
now with interest rates at zero

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680

now the other argument that is sometimes
 

00:38:38.850 --> 00:38:45.080
now the other argument that is sometimes
put is that lowering the fiscal deficit

00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:45.090
put is that lowering the fiscal deficit

will restore confidence there is no

00:38:48.740 --> 00:38:48.750
will restore confidence there is no
 

00:38:48.750 --> 00:38:51.920
will restore confidence there is no
evidence that that kind of restorative

00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:51.930
evidence that that kind of restorative
 

00:38:51.930 --> 00:38:54.680

investment in higher GDP but we cutting

00:38:58.430 --> 00:38:58.440
investment in higher GDP but we cutting
 

00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:00.080
investment in higher GDP but we cutting
back leads to lower GDP and that

00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:00.090
back leads to lower GDP and that
 

00:39:00.090 --> 00:39:04.010
back leads to lower GDP and that
undermines confidence there is one

00:39:04.010 --> 00:39:04.020
undermines confidence there is one
 

00:39:04.020 --> 00:39:07.940
undermines confidence there is one
mechanism that countries can use and

00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:07.950
mechanism that countries can use and
 

00:39:07.950 --> 00:39:11.060
mechanism that countries can use and
that is to raise taxes and raise

00:39:11.060 --> 00:39:11.070
that is to raise taxes and raise
 

00:39:11.070 --> 00:39:15.010
that is to raise taxes and raise
spending in a balanced budget way and

00:39:15.010 --> 00:39:15.020
spending in a balanced budget way and
 

00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.030
spending in a balanced budget way and
that's something called the balance

00:39:17.030 --> 00:39:17.040
that's something called the balance
 

00:39:17.040 --> 00:39:19.880
that's something called the balance
budget multiplier and if you raise your

00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:19.890
budget multiplier and if you raise your
 

00:39:19.890 --> 00:39:22.130
budget multiplier and if you raise your
taxes the right way and spend the right

00:39:22.130 --> 00:39:22.140
taxes the right way and spend the right
 

00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:26.359
taxes the right way and spend the right
way it can be quite large unfortunately

00:39:26.359 --> 00:39:26.369
way it can be quite large unfortunately
 

00:39:26.369 --> 00:39:28.280
way it can be quite large unfortunately
a lot of the discussion United States is

00:39:28.280 --> 00:39:28.290
a lot of the discussion United States is
 

00:39:28.290 --> 00:39:32.060
a lot of the discussion United States is
to cut taxes and cut spending which is

00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:32.070
to cut taxes and cut spending which is
 

00:39:32.070 --> 00:39:34.560
to cut taxes and cut spending which is
having exactly the

00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:34.570
having exactly the
 

00:39:34.570 --> 00:39:37.470
having exactly the
negative effect now your first question

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:37.480
negative effect now your first question
 

00:39:37.480 --> 00:39:40.790
negative effect now your first question
on the social cost of the youth bulge

00:39:40.790 --> 00:39:40.800
on the social cost of the youth bulge
 

00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:43.620
on the social cost of the youth bulge
what I tried to emphasize is it really

00:39:43.620 --> 00:39:43.630
what I tried to emphasize is it really
 

00:39:43.630 --> 00:39:46.110
what I tried to emphasize is it really
depends on how we respond to that youth

00:39:46.110 --> 00:39:46.120
depends on how we respond to that youth
 

00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:52.290
depends on how we respond to that youth
bulge if we fail to create jobs then the

00:39:52.290 --> 00:39:52.300
bulge if we fail to create jobs then the
 

00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:55.290
bulge if we fail to create jobs then the
cost can be absolutely enormous because

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:55.300
cost can be absolutely enormous because
 

00:39:55.300 --> 00:40:02.660
cost can be absolutely enormous because
it will lead to unrest it will social

00:40:02.660 --> 00:40:02.670
 

00:40:02.670 --> 00:40:06.330
disturbances of all kinds if on the

00:40:06.330 --> 00:40:06.340
disturbances of all kinds if on the
 

00:40:06.340 --> 00:40:10.380

other hand we are able to educate all

00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:10.390
other hand we are able to educate all
 

00:40:10.390 --> 00:40:12.950
other hand we are able to educate all
these young people and get them jobs

00:40:12.950 --> 00:40:12.960
these young people and get them jobs
 

00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:17.100
these young people and get them jobs
you'll wind up with a younger labor

00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:17.110
you'll wind up with a younger labor
 

00:40:17.110 --> 00:40:20.250
you'll wind up with a younger labor
force and I'm more dynamically before so

00:40:20.250 --> 00:40:20.260
force and I'm more dynamically before so
 

00:40:20.260 --> 00:40:22.400
force and I'm more dynamically before so
we could actually have a positive effect

00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:22.410
we could actually have a positive effect
 

00:40:22.410 --> 00:40:27.330
we could actually have a positive effect
now one of the final points is that the

00:40:27.330 --> 00:40:27.340
now one of the final points is that the
 

00:40:27.340 --> 00:40:32.210
now one of the final points is that the
sectors that if you have a youth bulge

00:40:32.210 --> 00:40:32.220
sectors that if you have a youth bulge
 

00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:34.710
sectors that if you have a youth bulge
the thing that you need to expand is

00:40:34.710 --> 00:40:34.720
the thing that you need to expand is
 

00:40:34.720 --> 00:40:39.980
the thing that you need to expand is
education in most countries education is

00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:04.450
make use of their force in the working
 

00:45:04.450 --> 00:45:07.319
make use of their force in the working
community yeah this is yeah that's a

00:45:07.319 --> 00:45:07.329
community yeah this is yeah that's a
 

00:45:07.329 --> 00:45:10.250
community yeah this is yeah that's a
very good question either I think that

00:45:10.250 --> 00:45:10.260
very good question either I think that
 

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.950
very good question either I think that
they're there are two aspects that I'd

00:45:13.950 --> 00:45:13.960
they're there are two aspects that I'd
 

00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:18.200
they're there are two aspects that I'd
like to focus on for modern economy

00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:18.210
like to focus on for modern economy
 

00:45:18.210 --> 00:45:21.180
like to focus on for modern economy
there has to be what we sometimes call

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:21.190
there has to be what we sometimes call
 

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:23.880
there has to be what we sometimes call
lifelong learning that the world is

00:45:23.880 --> 00:45:23.890
lifelong learning that the world is
 

00:45:23.890 --> 00:45:28.620
lifelong learning that the world is
always changing and they will not if

00:45:28.620 --> 00:45:28.630
always changing and they will not if
 

00:45:28.630 --> 00:45:30.480
always changing and they will not if
they're trained for its job today and

00:45:30.480 --> 00:45:30.490
they're trained for its job today and
 

00:45:30.490 --> 00:45:33.059
they're trained for its job today and
they don't learn they will become

00:45:33.059 --> 00:45:33.069
they don't learn they will become
 

00:45:33.069 --> 00:45:35.220
they don't learn they will become
obsolete and it used to be the people

00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:35.230
obsolete and it used to be the people
 

00:45:35.230 --> 00:45:36.750

00:45:36.750 --> 00:45:36.760
would have a job for a whole lifetime
 

00:45:36.760 --> 00:45:39.510
would have a job for a whole lifetime
but now they move from job to job and

00:45:39.510 --> 00:45:39.520
but now they move from job to job and
 

00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:41.880
but now they move from job to job and
that requires more and more skills so

00:45:41.880 --> 00:45:41.890
that requires more and more skills so
 

00:45:41.890 --> 00:45:44.970
that requires more and more skills so
what we need to do is two things one

00:45:44.970 --> 00:45:44.980
what we need to do is two things one
 

00:45:44.980 --> 00:45:47.670
what we need to do is two things one
have institutions that help provide that

00:45:47.670 --> 00:45:47.680
have institutions that help provide that
 

00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.280
have institutions that help provide that
lifelong learning you know they help

00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:50.290
lifelong learning you know they help
 

00:45:50.290 --> 00:45:52.500
lifelong learning you know they help
have the region you know and in medicine

have the region you know and in medicine
 

00:45:52.510 --> 00:45:55.020

you that you require people to keep
 

00:45:55.030 --> 00:45:57.210
you that you require people to keep
getting retrain so we have to think of

00:45:57.210 --> 00:45:57.220
getting retrain so we have to think of
 

00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.069
getting retrain so we have to think of
institutions that provide lifelong

00:45:59.069 --> 00:45:59.079
institutions that provide lifelong
 

00:45:59.079 --> 00:46:02.280
institutions that provide lifelong
learning but are in our universities we

00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:02.290
learning but are in our universities we
 

00:46:02.290 --> 00:46:03.720
learning but are in our universities we
have to think about how do we prepare

00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:03.730
have to think about how do we prepare
 

00:46:03.730 --> 00:46:05.789
have to think about how do we prepare
them for this process of lifelong

are going to be critical going forward
but the second thing is that we have to

00:46:22.859 --> 00:46:22.869
but the second thing is that we have to
 

00:46:22.869 --> 00:46:25.270
but the second thing is that we have to
help them get immersed in the labor

00:46:25.270 --> 00:46:25.280
help them get immersed in the labor
 

00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.580
help them get immersed in the labor

much the the point I'm making is that we
 

00:47:02.869 --> 00:47:05.740
much the the point I'm making is that we
have to do a better job of that

00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:05.750
have to do a better job of that

more immersed so I the bottom line is we

00:47:23.920 --> 00:47:23.930
more immersed so I the bottom line is we
 

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:26.500
more immersed so I the bottom line is we
have to do more of both we have to do

00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:26.510
have to do more of both we have to do
 

00:47:26.510 --> 00:47:29.230
have to do more of both we have to do
more of the liberal arts but also more

00:47:29.230 --> 00:47:29.240
more of the liberal arts but also more
 

00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:32.170
more of the liberal arts but also more

market fo push a un two questions for
you I was really struck by your comment

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:42.770
you I was really struck by your comment
 

00:47:42.770 --> 00:47:44.650
you I was really struck by your comment
about changing the structure of you know

how we teach in terms of smaller classes

00:47:47.170 --> 00:47:47.180
how we teach in terms of smaller classes
 

00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:49.000
how we teach in terms of smaller classes
in the first couple of years larger

classes perhaps and in that context I

00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:51.890
classes perhaps and in that context I
 

00:47:51.890 --> 00:47:53.650
classes perhaps and in that context I
wonder you know there's been a lot of

00:47:53.650 --> 00:47:53.660
wonder you know there's been a lot of
 

00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.440
wonder you know there's been a lot of
discussion about use of adjuncts use of

00:47:56.440 --> 00:47:56.450
discussion about use of adjuncts use of
 

00:47:56.450 --> 00:47:58.540

graduate teaching and some of the
 

00:47:58.550 --> 00:48:01.089
graduate teaching and some of the
difficulties with that I wonder if you

00:48:01.089 --> 00:48:01.099
difficulties with that I wonder if you
 

00:48:01.099 --> 00:48:04.000
difficulties with that I wonder if you
could talk a little bit about that and

00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.010
could talk a little bit about that and
 

00:48:04.010 --> 00:48:05.710
could talk a little bit about that and
then the second question you know at the

00:48:05.710 --> 00:48:05.720
then the second question you know at the
 

00:48:05.720 --> 00:48:08.109
then the second question you know at the

UN one of the things we're finding is
 

00:48:08.119 --> 00:48:10.180
UN one of the things we're finding is
that for many of the global challenges

the importance of liberal arts education
 

00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:29.890
the importance of liberal arts education
that tends to focus more on linear

that tends to focus more on linear
 

00:48:29.900 --> 00:48:36.010
that tends to focus more on linear
thinking and I'm wondering whether we

00:48:36.010 --> 00:48:36.020
thinking and I'm wondering whether we
 

00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:38.290
thinking and I'm wondering whether we
need to be thinking about the core that

00:48:38.290 --> 00:48:38.300
need to be thinking about the core that

everybody so it seems to me that there

00:56:02.509 --> 00:56:02.519
everybody so it seems to me that there
 

00:56:02.519 --> 00:56:04.309

there is a compelling argument that the

think universities have to show that

efforts to become more efficient they're

00:56:20.240 --> 00:56:20.250
efforts to become more efficient they're
 

00:56:20.250 --> 00:56:22.309
efforts to become more efficient they're
not just doing things business as usual

00:56:22.309 --> 00:56:22.319
not just doing things business as usual
 

00:56:22.319 --> 00:56:25.160

that they are they are trying to get

that they are they are trying to get
their costs down and they're trying to

their costs down and they're trying to
 

00:56:26.519 --> 00:56:28.099
their costs down and they're trying to
think about how to be more efficient and

00:56:28.099 --> 00:56:28.109
think about how to be more efficient and
 

00:56:28.109 --> 00:56:30.559
think about how to be more efficient and
gain access so it seems to me that that

00:56:30.559 --> 00:56:30.569
gain access so it seems to me that that
 

00:56:30.569 --> 00:56:34.279

to a certain extent but we have to work
 

00:58:35.309 --> 00:58:37.130
to a certain extent but we have to work
harder and understanding them we clearly

00:58:37.130 --> 00:58:37.140
harder and understanding them we clearly

failed you know in a deep understanding
but the bigger problem is we don't

but the bigger problem is we don't

something like this youth bulge you can
approach it by saying you know for

00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:13.890
approach it by saying you know for
 

00:59:13.890 --> 00:59:15.559
approach it by saying you know for
purposes of dealing with this massive

00:59:15.559 --> 00:59:15.569
purposes of dealing with this massive
 

00:59:15.569 --> 00:59:18.680
purposes of dealing with this massive
problem we understand pretty much all we

00:59:18.680 --> 00:59:18.690
problem we understand pretty much all we
 

00:59:18.690 --> 00:59:21.650
problem we understand pretty much all we
need to do we got to figure out how to

00:59:21.650 --> 00:59:21.660
need to do we got to figure out how to
 

00:59:21.660 --> 00:59:23.359
need to do we got to figure out how to
implement policies it's

00:59:23.359 --> 00:59:23.369
implement policies it's
 

00:59:23.369 --> 00:59:26.690
implement policies it's
a matter of deep research or you could

00:59:26.690 --> 00:59:26.700
a matter of deep research or you could
 

00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:28.519
a matter of deep research or you could
say it really is a matter of deep

00:59:28.519 --> 00:59:28.529
say it really is a matter of deep
 

00:59:28.529 --> 00:59:32.329
say it really is a matter of deep
research or it is as well and these are

00:59:32.329 --> 00:59:32.339
research or it is as well and these are
 

00:59:32.339 --> 00:59:35.749
research or it is as well and these are
major questions that the universities in

00:59:35.749 --> 00:59:35.759
major questions that the universities in
 

00:59:35.759 --> 00:59:39.079
major questions that the universities in
this room and other university should

00:59:39.079 --> 00:59:39.089
this room and other university should
 

00:59:39.089 --> 00:59:43.900
this room and other university should
devote themselves more to than we do and

00:59:43.900 --> 00:59:43.910
devote themselves more to than we do and
 

00:59:43.910 --> 00:59:46.460
devote themselves more to than we do and

ignorance the fact that we just don't

00:59:58.039 --> 00:59:58.049
ignorance the fact that we just don't
 

00:59:58.049 --> 01:00:00.559
ignorance the fact that we just don't
understand things that's a key part of

01:00:00.559 --> 01:00:00.569
understand things that's a key part of
 

01:00:00.569 --> 01:00:02.950
understand things that's a key part of
dealing with the problems that are here

01:00:02.950 --> 01:00:02.960
dealing with the problems that are here
 

01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:05.329
dealing with the problems that are here
well I guess I put it somewhere in

01:00:05.329 --> 01:00:05.339
well I guess I put it somewhere in
 

01:00:05.339 --> 01:00:09.019
well I guess I put it somewhere in
between I think the real danger is what

01:00:09.019 --> 01:00:09.029
between I think the real danger is what
 

01:00:09.029 --> 01:00:11.870
between I think the real danger is what
i see is complacency by some of the

i see is complacency by some of the
people who think that they understood

01:00:13.579 --> 01:00:13.589
people who think that they understood
 

01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:16.789
people who think that they understood
things and didn't that's the real danger

01:00:16.789 --> 01:00:16.799
things and didn't that's the real danger
 

01:00:16.799 --> 01:00:18.559
things and didn't that's the real danger
and there were a lot of people i won't

name them yeah who fall in that category
yeah we understand some of the when we

01:00:31.339 --> 01:00:31.349
yeah we understand some of the when we
 

01:00:31.349 --> 01:00:33.670
yeah we understand some of the when we
say we understand some of the problems

01:00:33.670 --> 01:00:33.680
say we understand some of the problems
 

01:00:33.680 --> 01:00:39.680
say we understand some of the problems
and well before the crisis you know i

01:00:39.680 --> 01:00:39.690
and well before the crisis you know i

the business school and I had done a
 

01:00:48.690 --> 01:00:51.410
the business school and I had done a
book where we we talked about how you

book where we we talked about how you
 

01:00:51.420 --> 01:00:53.989
book where we we talked about how you
could have bankruptcy Cascades and and

01:00:53.989 --> 01:00:53.999
could have bankruptcy Cascades and and
 

01:00:53.999 --> 01:00:56.239
could have bankruptcy Cascades and and
how problem when one bank could lead to

01:00:56.239 --> 01:00:56.249
how problem when one bank could lead to
 

01:00:56.249 --> 01:00:58.999
how problem when one bank could lead to
another that was not taking on board at

all by the the central bank's you know

01:01:04.789 --> 01:01:04.799
all by the the central bank's you know
 

01:01:04.799 --> 01:01:09.109
all by the the central bank's you know
that they they they really ignored lines

of thought that were outside of their
 

01:01:11.670 --> 01:01:15.109
of thought that were outside of their
narrow lens what are the implications

01:01:15.109 --> 01:01:15.119
narrow lens what are the implications
 

01:01:15.119 --> 01:01:16.999
narrow lens what are the implications
for universities what seems to me first

01:01:16.999 --> 01:01:17.009
for universities what seems to me first
 

01:01:17.009 --> 01:01:21.529
for universities what seems to me first
I think we we ought to try to inculcate

01:01:21.529 --> 01:01:21.539
I think we we ought to try to inculcate
 

01:01:21.539 --> 01:01:30.170
I think we we ought to try to inculcate
a spirit of modesty that you know the

01:01:30.170 --> 01:01:30.180
a spirit of modesty that you know the
 

01:01:30.180 --> 01:01:34.039
a spirit of modesty that you know the
world is complex we understand some

01:01:34.039 --> 01:01:34.049
world is complex we understand some
 

01:01:34.049 --> 01:01:36.970
world is complex we understand some
things but we shouldn't be overconfident

01:01:36.970 --> 01:01:36.980
things but we shouldn't be overconfident
 

01:01:36.980 --> 01:01:41.270
things but we shouldn't be overconfident
and the most important thing that i

01:01:41.270 --> 01:01:41.280
and the most important thing that i
 

01:01:41.280 --> 01:01:45.500
and the most important thing that i
think when i was in college that i was

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:45.510
think when i was in college that i was
 

01:01:45.510 --> 01:01:47.510
think when i was in college that i was
taught is the most important thing is to

01:01:47.510 --> 01:01:47.520
taught is the most important thing is to
 

01:01:47.520 --> 01:01:50.840
taught is the most important thing is to
ask the right questions and part of

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:50.850
ask the right questions and part of
 

01:01:50.850 --> 01:01:52.730
ask the right questions and part of
asking price right questions delineating

01:01:52.730 --> 01:01:52.740
asking price right questions delineating
 

01:01:52.740 --> 01:01:55.940
asking price right questions delineating
what do we know and you know there was a

01:01:55.940 --> 01:01:55.950
what do we know and you know there was a
 

01:01:55.950 --> 01:01:58.490
what do we know and you know there was a
sold expression the real danger is the

01:01:58.490 --> 01:01:58.500
sold expression the real danger is the
 

01:01:58.500 --> 01:02:01.900
sold expression the real danger is the
things that we know that aren't true and

01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:01.910
things that we know that aren't true and
 

01:02:01.910 --> 01:02:04.460
things that we know that aren't true and
so let me give you an example I raised

01:02:04.460 --> 01:02:04.470
so let me give you an example I raised
 

01:02:04.470 --> 01:02:08.890
so let me give you an example I raised
in my talk one of the issues of a

01:02:08.890 --> 01:02:08.900
in my talk one of the issues of a
 

01:02:08.900 --> 01:02:13.460
in my talk one of the issues of a
monetary policy in a world of open

01:02:13.460 --> 01:02:13.470
monetary policy in a world of open
 

01:02:13.470 --> 01:02:16.880
monetary policy in a world of open
economy where we expand have

01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:16.890
economy where we expand have
 

01:02:16.890 --> 01:02:18.740
economy where we expand have
expansionary monetary policy but it

01:02:18.740 --> 01:02:18.750
expansionary monetary policy but it
 

01:02:18.750 --> 01:02:21.920
expansionary monetary policy but it
doesn't affect yeah us yeah that's an

01:02:21.920 --> 01:02:21.930
doesn't affect yeah us yeah that's an
 

01:02:21.930 --> 01:02:24.500
doesn't affect yeah us yeah that's an
example of you know monetary policy in a

01:02:24.500 --> 01:02:24.510
example of you know monetary policy in a
 

01:02:24.510 --> 01:02:26.600
example of you know monetary policy in a
globalized world is very different than

01:02:26.600 --> 01:02:26.610
globalized world is very different than
 

01:02:26.610 --> 01:02:29.330
globalized world is very different than
monetary policy in a closed economy yeah

01:02:29.330 --> 01:02:29.340
monetary policy in a closed economy yeah
 

01:02:29.340 --> 01:02:31.490
monetary policy in a closed economy yeah
there has not been very well why do we

01:02:31.490 --> 01:02:31.500
there has not been very well why do we
 

01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.520
there has not been very well why do we
yeah Annalise yeah yeah that's the kind

01:02:34.520 --> 01:02:34.530
yeah Annalise yeah yeah that's the kind
 

01:02:34.530 --> 01:02:36.590
yeah Annalise yeah yeah that's the kind
of question that in the University and

01:02:36.590 --> 01:02:36.600
of question that in the University and
 

01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:39.440
of question that in the University and
our students we ought to be raising even

01:02:39.440 --> 01:02:39.450
our students we ought to be raising even
 

01:02:39.450 --> 01:02:42.110
our students we ought to be raising even
if we don't fully know the food know the

01:02:42.110 --> 01:02:42.120
if we don't fully know the food know the
 

01:02:42.120 --> 01:02:45.050
if we don't fully know the food know the
full answer it at least alerts them to

01:02:45.050 --> 01:02:45.060
full answer it at least alerts them to
 

01:02:45.060 --> 01:02:46.340
full answer it at least alerts them to
thinking about things in a slightly

01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:46.350
thinking about things in a slightly
 

01:02:46.350 --> 01:02:50.050
thinking about things in a slightly
different way and hopefully encourages

01:02:50.050 --> 01:02:50.060
different way and hopefully encourages
 

01:02:50.060 --> 01:02:52.790
different way and hopefully encourages
research now I would go back to the

01:02:52.790 --> 01:02:52.800
research now I would go back to the
 

01:02:52.800 --> 01:02:54.800
research now I would go back to the
previous question about how do you sell

01:02:54.800 --> 01:02:54.810
previous question about how do you sell
 

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:57.470
previous question about how do you sell
governments on why they should be

01:02:57.470 --> 01:02:57.480
governments on why they should be
 

01:02:57.480 --> 01:02:59.090
governments on why they should be
supporting universities one of the ways

01:02:59.090 --> 01:02:59.100
supporting universities one of the ways
 

01:02:59.100 --> 01:03:00.680
supporting universities one of the ways
you do it is to say look there are these

01:03:00.680 --> 01:03:00.690
you do it is to say look there are these
 

01:03:00.690 --> 01:03:03.350
you do it is to say look there are these
important questionings that we don't yet

01:03:03.350 --> 01:03:03.360
important questionings that we don't yet
 

01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:06.950
important questionings that we don't yet
fully know the answer to yeah and if we

01:03:06.950 --> 01:03:06.960
fully know the answer to yeah and if we
 

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:09.860
fully know the answer to yeah and if we
have to rely simply on the received

01:03:09.860 --> 01:03:09.870
have to rely simply on the received
 

01:03:09.870 --> 01:03:11.840
have to rely simply on the received
wisdom we're going to make a lot of

01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:11.850
wisdom we're going to make a lot of
 

01:03:11.850 --> 01:03:15.770
wisdom we're going to make a lot of
mistakes we still may make mistakes but

01:03:15.770 --> 01:03:15.780
mistakes we still may make mistakes but
 

01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:19.220
mistakes we still may make mistakes but
at least we should be on guard aware of

01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:19.230
at least we should be on guard aware of
 

01:03:19.230 --> 01:03:23.060
at least we should be on guard aware of
the things that might go wrong yep well

01:03:23.060 --> 01:03:23.070
the things that might go wrong yep well
 

01:03:23.070 --> 01:03:26.090
the things that might go wrong yep well
we're at the end of this unfortunately I

01:03:26.090 --> 01:03:26.100
we're at the end of this unfortunately I
 

01:03:26.100 --> 01:03:28.940
we're at the end of this unfortunately I
want to say two things the first is that

01:03:28.940 --> 01:03:28.950
want to say two things the first is that
 

01:03:28.950 --> 01:03:31.720
want to say two things the first is that
I will do everything that Joe

01:03:31.720 --> 01:03:31.730
I will do everything that Joe
 

01:03:31.730 --> 01:03:35.480
I will do everything that Joe
recommended that we do except for one

01:03:35.480 --> 01:03:35.490
recommended that we do except for one
 

01:03:35.490 --> 01:03:37.130
recommended that we do except for one
and that is to take on the students and

01:03:37.130 --> 01:03:37.140
and that is to take on the students and
 

01:03:37.140 --> 01:03:38.990
and that is to take on the students and
have them go to class before 10 and

01:03:38.990 --> 01:03:39.000
have them go to class before 10 and
 

01:03:39.000 --> 01:03:41.960
have them go to class before 10 and
that's I'm smart enough to know that

01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:41.970
that's I'm smart enough to know that
 

01:03:41.970 --> 01:03:44.600
that's I'm smart enough to know that
that's one you don't don't do everything

01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:44.610
that's one you don't don't do everything
 

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:47.960
that's one you don't don't do everything
else I'll fix here the second is you can
