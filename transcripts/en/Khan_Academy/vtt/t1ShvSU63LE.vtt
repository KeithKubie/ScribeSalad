00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.370
- [Narrator] How has the position

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.350
of Speaker of the House changed over time?

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:05.550
- The position of Speaker of the House

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:07.150
has changed a lot over time

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.610
and it has had powerful early advocates,

00:00:09.610 --> 00:00:11.980
Henry Clay, an early Speaker of the House

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.870
who had three different
terms as Speaker of the House

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.600
used the position to shepherd all kinds of

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.240
legislation to improve America.

00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.620
He also played a crucial
role in John Quincy Adam's

00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:27.370
becoming President because
the election was thrown

00:00:27.370 --> 00:00:28.203
into the House.

00:00:28.203 --> 00:00:29.740
He was quite powerful.

00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:33.680
Then the job kind of got less powerful.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:35.310
There were periods during the Civil War

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:37.060
where there wasn't a Speaker of the House

00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:40.020
for long periods because
there was so much contention

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.926
in the Congress they couldn't
pick a Speaker of the House.

00:00:42.926 --> 00:00:45.730
The modern Speaker of the House has become

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:50.400
increasingly powerful really growing with

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:52.350
the growth of the federal government

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:54.670
around let's say the second World War.

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.220
Various different Speakers
gaining more power

00:00:57.220 --> 00:00:59.130
and in the recent incarnation

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.565
the Speaker is particularly powerful

00:01:01.565 --> 00:01:03.220
in two different ways.

00:01:03.220 --> 00:01:05.480
One is shepherding a
President's legislation

00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.870
if the Speaker is from the same party

00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:09.900
and the other is in opposition.

00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:12.670
They become essentially the opposition

00:01:12.670 --> 00:01:16.380
speaking against a President
of an opposite party.

00:01:16.380 --> 00:01:18.700
So people like that would be Nancy Pelosi

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:19.960
now with President Trump

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:23.040
or John Boehner with President Obama

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.700
or Tip O'Neill with President Reagan.

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:29.610
So they are the key person in doing combat

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:30.840
with whoever's in the White House

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.590
if they're from the opposite party.
