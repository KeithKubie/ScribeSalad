00:00:00.220 --> 00:00:05.110
In modern browsers, there is a cool
feature that you could use; autofill.

00:00:05.110 --> 00:00:07.780
Users appreciate when
a website save them

00:00:07.780 --> 00:00:13.138
time by automatically filling common
fields like name, email, and more.

00:00:13.138 --> 00:00:17.710
Plus autofill helps to reduce
potential input errors

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:20.290
like what Cam experienced before.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:24.055
Browsers use many heuristics to
determine which field they could

00:00:24.055 --> 00:00:29.320
auto-populate based on a previously
specified data by the user.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.250
You, the developer, can give hints
to the browser by providing both

00:00:34.250 --> 00:00:39.060
the name attribute and the auto complete
attribute on each input element.

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:44.180
For example, to give the browser a hint
that it should auto complete the form

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:47.770
with a user's name,
email, and phone number.

00:00:47.770 --> 00:00:50.870
You should use these
auto complete attributes.

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:54.810
Let's have a look on the name or
should I say the first name,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:01:00.080
the input element has an AutoComplete
attribute equal fname.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:04.410
On the email input,
we have the autocomplete equal email.

00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.880
And on the phone input element,

00:01:06.880 --> 00:01:10.730
I'll have the tell AutoComplete
like you could see here.

00:01:10.730 --> 00:01:12.250
Let's see it in action.

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:16.650
When I start typing the address, you
could see that the browser is already

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:20.100
remember what was typed here before.

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.150
And now with a click on the enter,

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:25.980
I'm filling the shipping
address with just a few clicks.

00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:27.400
Awesome.

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:28.690
In the instructor notes,

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:32.530
you could find a massive list
of auto-complete attributes.

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.180
Take a look and see how you could
automate life for your users.

00:01:37.180 --> 00:01:40.030
And put a big smile on their faces.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:43.227
Now it's your turn to add
some AutoComplete attributes.
