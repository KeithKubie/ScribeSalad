00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.479
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:49.930
TU FAN: In the face of the
challenges of climate change,

00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:52.920
and the depleting
natural resources,

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:55.790
humans exploring
physical solutions

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:59.800
to sustainable development
Green technology

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:02.980
can be one of the good options.

00:01:02.980 --> 00:01:08.190
Since 2009, Malaysia has
been facilitating application

00:01:08.190 --> 00:01:11.140
of green technology
through implementing

00:01:11.140 --> 00:01:14.490
the national green
technology policy.

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.290
Over the centuries, humans have
tried to change the weather.

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:23.460
People have prayed and used
strategies to get more rain

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.570
and decrease the heat.

00:01:25.570 --> 00:01:29.240
While we have not intentionally
tried to change the climate,

00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:32.330
we have unintentionally
brought about changes

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:36.010
that are affecting us today.

00:01:36.010 --> 00:01:40.540
Starting in the middle 1700s,
the Industrial Revolution

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.600
and the modern
agriculture practice

00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:46.670
began to [INAUDIBLE] amount of
human-created carbon dioxide

00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.980
emissions in the atmosphere.

00:01:49.980 --> 00:01:52.380
Global carbon dioxide
emissions have

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:59.160
been rising at an annual average
of 2.7% during the past decade.

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.290
Countries all over the world
are used different techniques

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:05.360
to reduce carbon emissions.

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.360
These include establishing
power markets,

00:02:09.360 --> 00:02:14.670
creating policy and legislation,
and a green technology.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:19.390
My research has focused on
green technology in Malaysia,

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.660
but do you know what
green technology is?

00:02:23.660 --> 00:02:26.415
Green technology is a
development and preparation

00:02:26.415 --> 00:02:30.370
of products,
equipment, and systems

00:02:30.370 --> 00:02:35.350
that conserve natural resources,
which minimizes and reduces

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:39.410
negative environmental
impact of human activities.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:43.120
What makes a technology green?

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.300
It minimizes
environmental degradation.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.610
It has zero or low
green gas emissions.

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:51.640
It is safe to use,
and it promotes

00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:56.470
a healthy environmental
for all life forms.

00:02:56.470 --> 00:03:00.290
It conserves energy
and natural resources.

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:04.080
It relies on
renewable resources.

00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:07.880
Green technology is
not a new concept.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:12.260
People have been trying to go
green for decades, including

00:03:12.260 --> 00:03:16.610
using wave motors, wind
turbines, solar power

00:03:16.610 --> 00:03:20.740
plants, and other
[INAUDIBLE] energy ideas.

00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:23.760
In keeping with global
trends, Malaysia

00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:26.520
has recently
proactively promoted

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.520
and adopt green technology.

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:31.660
In 2009, Malaysia
has established

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.750
the country's ministry of
energy, green technology,

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.230
and the water, also
called KeTTHa in Malay,

00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:42.330
and adopted national
green technology policy.

00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:46.110
The main goal is to
contribute to economic growth,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.320
and to reduce Malaysia's
carbon footprint.

00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:52.330
The objective of the
policy it to conduct

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:54.790
industrial and government
through supporting

00:03:54.790 --> 00:03:57.870
in putting buildings,
green transportation,

00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:01.970
renewable energy use,
waste and water management.

00:04:01.970 --> 00:04:05.830
The most important
components of this policy

00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:09.070
include setting up
institutions and launching

00:04:09.070 --> 00:04:10.710
fiscal instruments.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:15.400
Setting up institutions is a
key strategy in the policy.

00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.990
Since green technology involves
many different sectors,

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:21.810
it is important to
have a structure that

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:25.510
involves all the relevant
stakeholders to ensure

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:27.600
consensus and support.

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.240
The national green technology
and climate change council

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:33.990
coordinates green
technology issues

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:38.010
between the ministries,
agencies, the private sector,

00:04:38.010 --> 00:04:42.910
and other stakeholders
that implement policies,

00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:46.600
in addition, the agencies
that assist and contribute

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:49.510
to development of
green technology,

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.290
like the Green
Technology Corporation.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:55.330
As a focal point for green
technology development

00:04:55.330 --> 00:04:58.090
in Malaysia, green
technology cooperation

00:04:58.090 --> 00:05:00.335
provide facilities
and the services

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:05.540
in advisory, consultancy,
urban energy management,

00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.120
and training.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.310
Malaysia green technology
[INAUDIBLE] scheme

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:12.800
is a most important
fiscal instruments

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:17.140
to attract private entities
to use green technology.

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:20.570
This scheme is for both
the users and producers

00:05:20.570 --> 00:05:22.160
of green technology.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:27.360
It was initially started with
1.5 billion ringgits soft loan

00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:30.920
and has now increased
to 3.5 billion ringgits.

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:36.990
The scheme offers a 2% interest
subsidy, and 60% of the loan

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:39.600
will be guaranteed
by the government.

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:45.380
From 2009 to November,
2014 351 projects

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.670
were covered by this scheme,
including 243 energy efficiency

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:56.100
projects, 17 green building
projects, 91 waste and water

00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:57.490
projects.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.650
The majority of projects
are located in Kuala Lumpur,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:03.420
Selangor, and the Johor Bahru.

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:07.050
Most of projects focus
on electrical electronics

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:10.620
subsector, and the
biotechnology subsector.

00:06:10.620 --> 00:06:14.290
Besides actions stipulated
from the ministry level,

00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:18.220
we can also see some
progress at a regional level.

00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:21.840
Iskander Malaysia is an
important economic corridor

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:25.190
in the southern part
of peninsula Malaysia.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:28.440
It has recently begun
low carbon programs.

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:32.700
The Low Carbon Blueprint
Iskander Malaysia 2025

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.190
was endorsed by the product
minister of Malaysia

00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:38.500
in the Summit 2012.

00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:42.680
This blueprint was prepared
by a group of urban planners

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.480
and researchers.

00:06:44.480 --> 00:06:48.440
Professor Ho Chin Siong from
University Technology Malaysia

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.450
is a main member of this team.

00:06:50.450 --> 00:06:53.550
HO CHIN SIONG: I think
green technology policy

00:06:53.550 --> 00:06:56.110
is a very important
policy, because you focus

00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.870
on the use of green technology
in city building or city

00:06:59.870 --> 00:07:00.750
planning.

00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:06.460
So in our country here, we are
trying to use energy efficiency

00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:07.650
technology.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.740
We are trying to use
renewable energy technology,

00:07:10.740 --> 00:07:12.290
and also recycling.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.100
The solid waste management
office, urban planning

00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:19.230
have to reconsider
how to promote

00:07:19.230 --> 00:07:22.630
green technology, or green
energy, or green transport,

00:07:22.630 --> 00:07:25.044
or green industry
in city planning.

00:07:25.044 --> 00:07:26.460
So I think this
is the way forward

00:07:26.460 --> 00:07:29.150
for our nation [INAUDIBLE]

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:31.610
TU FAN: Also Malaysia
has made progress

00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:33.980
in promoting green technology.

00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.070
Interviews with government
officials, researchers,

00:07:37.070 --> 00:07:41.880
and industrial firms, shows that
many pieces as still missing.

00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:45.230
First, information about green
technology and the policies

00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:47.350
are still very limited.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.630
I conducted a questionnaire
in 15 factories.

00:07:51.630 --> 00:07:55.760
It shows that one of the main
barriers for industrial firms

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.890
to use green technology
is information.

00:07:58.890 --> 00:08:01.490
TEH KEE SIN: The government
intention is good.

00:08:01.490 --> 00:08:03.840
But sometimes the SME are
facing another challenges.

00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:08.210
When it comes to the green
technology or green industries,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:13.480
sometimes when we want to get
someone to justify that you are

00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:16.470
in the green industries,
sometimes we cannot get

00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:19.862
the right person, to confirm
and justify that we are in that

00:08:19.862 --> 00:08:20.362
field.

00:08:20.362 --> 00:08:26.380
Sometimes we may not be
able to get the [INAUDIBLE]

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:29.065
So this is another challenge
that we are facing.

00:08:29.065 --> 00:08:30.690
HO CHIN SIONG: Some
of this information

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:33.309
may not have reached
other industrialists.

00:08:33.309 --> 00:08:37.010
But I think the important part
is, actually, this information

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:41.620
have to be disseminated
to a bigger group.

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:44.410
And then I think
we strongly feel

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:49.820
that the chamber of commerce
industry association

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:51.650
should look closely,
also trying to get

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:56.530
to know more about this green--
I think the ministry themselves

00:08:56.530 --> 00:08:57.030
do know.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:09:01.860
They are trying ways and means
to disseminate this information

00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:04.760
so that actually more and
more people have opportunity

00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:07.020
to access to this
green tech plan.

00:09:07.020 --> 00:09:10.790
TU FAN: Did you hear about
that green technology policy?

00:09:10.790 --> 00:09:11.759
SPEAKER: What?

00:09:11.759 --> 00:09:12.800
TU FAN: Green technology.

00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:16.430
SPEAKER: I myself, I
like all these things.

00:09:16.430 --> 00:09:21.740
Green energy, now maybe they
use more of these solar energy,

00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:23.840
green energy.

00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.160
I think these are the two main
things they are using now.

00:09:27.160 --> 00:09:32.830
So solar energy-- actually,
I myself am using it.

00:09:32.830 --> 00:09:35.760
Now they use it for
as a hobby, but later

00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:37.780
on when I know more
about it, maybe

00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:43.130
I will use it partially to
reduce my company's electricity

00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:46.700
to replace other supplies
to cut down the cost.

00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.440
TU FAN: Secondly,
there is a mismatch

00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.960
between the needs of
the firms, and the focus

00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.530
of government programs.

00:09:53.530 --> 00:09:57.850
According to the questionnaire,
industrial firms priorities

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.350
were waste water, energy
utilization, solid waste,

00:10:02.350 --> 00:10:04.670
energy supply, and
then green buildings.

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:07.760
However, most of the
government incentives

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:11.050
go to energy projects,
mostly for solar.

00:10:11.050 --> 00:10:13.300
PRAKASH NAGALINGAM: We feel
that too much emphasis has

00:10:13.300 --> 00:10:16.490
been given to solar,
and we are trying

00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.950
to look into other areas
like thermal energy

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.323
and also the ocean
thermal energy which

00:10:24.323 --> 00:10:26.120
will lead new energies as well.

00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:29.410
Because initially the green
technology concentration

00:10:29.410 --> 00:10:31.776
was only by the
federal government.

00:10:31.776 --> 00:10:35.240
We didn't incorporate with
the state governments.

00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:37.740
As you can see, the
green technology concept

00:10:37.740 --> 00:10:38.850
is a federal concept.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:44.530
But these [INAUDIBLE] encouraged
all the state governments

00:10:44.530 --> 00:10:46.990
to have their own
green technology

00:10:46.990 --> 00:10:48.590
concept in state level.

00:10:48.590 --> 00:10:51.800
So once the state level has
their own green technology

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:55.060
concert, so this kind of
mission can be discussed more

00:10:55.060 --> 00:10:56.600
in the particular states.

00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:01.430
So then you can see,
now, I do agree with you,

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.470
the advantage is
pretty much low.

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.110
TU FAN: To improve the
wave implementation,

00:11:07.110 --> 00:11:11.450
there is urgent need to have
a validation of the policy.

00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:14.460
Until now, there
has no assessment

00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:16.530
of the green technology
policy implementation.

00:11:16.530 --> 00:11:18.155
PRAKASH NAGALINGAM:
They can do so much

00:11:18.155 --> 00:11:20.340
in [INAUDIBLE]
investment, I mean

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:23.140
creating a scenario
for the investment,

00:11:23.140 --> 00:11:25.090
for the green
technology players.

00:11:25.090 --> 00:11:29.130
But then, as I can tell you that
we are not really sure how much

00:11:29.130 --> 00:11:32.140
benefit [INAUDIBLE]
by these people,

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:35.890
and how much green technology
has contributed to the policies

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:36.910
of--

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:38.540
TU FAN: Adopting
green technology

00:11:38.540 --> 00:11:41.990
will not be easy for
developing countries.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:45.860
The most important reason
is that green technology

00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:49.170
is a comparatively
expensive approach.

00:11:49.170 --> 00:11:52.050
Even in developing
countries, we still

00:11:52.050 --> 00:11:54.940
can see that the argument
about if government

00:11:54.940 --> 00:11:58.000
should invest in
green technology.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:02.230
But it is clear from the
experience from Malaysia

00:12:02.230 --> 00:12:04.230
that government
incentives are still

00:12:04.230 --> 00:12:07.860
very important to
encourage green technology.

00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:10.840
PRAKASH NAGALINGAM: People say
that only developing countries,

00:12:10.840 --> 00:12:13.890
I mean, concentrate too much
on subsidies and incentives,

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:16.180
but actually it's a
[INAUDIBLE] scenario.

00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:17.955
Last time I went to
Holland, Netherlands.

00:12:17.955 --> 00:12:20.080
As you can Netherlands is
a very developed country,

00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:23.080
and they really pay much
attention to the environment.

00:12:23.080 --> 00:12:25.782
The are very environment
friendly people.

00:12:25.782 --> 00:12:27.640
But, they have, when
it comes to transport

00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.450
industry, the
government, in 2013,

00:12:30.450 --> 00:12:32.850
they came up with this
incentive for green,

00:12:32.850 --> 00:12:37.560
I mean electric vehicles, and
also plug-in electric vehicles.

00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.050
So when the incentive
was introduced in 2013,

00:12:40.050 --> 00:12:43.070
the sales of EV rocketed.

00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:47.500
And the highest sale [INAUDIBLE]
went to Mitsubishi Outlander.

00:12:47.500 --> 00:12:48.650
It's known as PHEW.

00:12:48.650 --> 00:12:52.580
It's actually a plug-in
hybrid, electric vehicle.

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:58.710
But when the incentive ended
by 31st December, 2013,

00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:02.300
sales of electric
vehicles in Netherlands

00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:05.720
dropped tremendously in 2014.

00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.000
So as you can see, the lifestyle
of people, the consumers

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.060
are very much related to
incentives and subsidies.

00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:15.060
TU FAN: Secondly, for
developing countries,

00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:19.050
having consensus will be
equally critical for launching

00:13:19.050 --> 00:13:22.740
green technology actions
across every area,

00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:27.870
from construction, to
transportation, to industrial.

00:13:27.870 --> 00:13:31.710
Malaysia has developed
incentive policies,

00:13:31.710 --> 00:13:35.910
but local government needs to
be involved for that knowledge

00:13:35.910 --> 00:13:38.690
to be diffused
across the country.

00:13:38.690 --> 00:13:41.250
This is also an
important law for

00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.590
other non-government
institutions

00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.570
such as industrial associations.

00:13:47.570 --> 00:13:51.530
The way the funding of SME
comes now, the funding of SME.

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:53.030
TEH KEE SIN: No,
we have no funding.

00:13:53.030 --> 00:13:55.310
Yeah, we don't have
funding because we

00:13:55.310 --> 00:13:57.230
should be self funded, I think.

00:13:57.230 --> 00:14:01.840
So sometimes when we talk about
the funding for the R and D.

00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.900
R and D is a long
term investment.

00:14:03.900 --> 00:14:07.570
At the beginning stage you may
not be earning benefit at all.

00:14:07.570 --> 00:14:10.520
So you have to come up
with a lot of resources.

00:14:10.520 --> 00:14:13.580
For the green [INAUDIBLE]
or green industry

00:14:13.580 --> 00:14:21.310
or even the [INAUDIBLE]
We still have

00:14:21.310 --> 00:14:26.031
to-- the government [INAUDIBLE]
whether it be the [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:26.031 --> 00:14:28.280
or whether it be the [INAUDIBLE]
the government should

00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.328
take the lead.

00:14:32.650 --> 00:14:35.260
[INAUDIBLE] in terms of
the green [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:35.260 --> 00:14:37.770
green technology,
green industry,

00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.216
we are still so much behind some
other countries in our region.

00:14:41.216 --> 00:14:44.200
You know, Japan,
Taiwan or even China,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:46.424
I think we are still
pretty much behind them.

00:14:46.424 --> 00:14:47.340
So we hope [INAUDIBLE]

00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:58.980
Also blaming some
of the ministry.

00:14:58.980 --> 00:15:01.810
[INAUDIBLE] that never
[INAUDIBLE] That's why

00:15:01.810 --> 00:15:02.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:15:10.870 --> 00:15:13.365
TU FAN: The size of government
support, both federal

00:15:13.365 --> 00:15:15.960
and the local government,
and the cooperation

00:15:15.960 --> 00:15:19.640
from associations, public
education and capacity

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:23.830
building for the labor
force are also important.

00:15:23.830 --> 00:15:27.000
No matter how difficult
it is, people in Malaysia

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:32.610
have become aware that behavior
change is much important.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.782
Without behavior change,
nothing will happen.

00:15:35.782 --> 00:15:37.990
HO CHIN SIONG: We should
not only look at mitigation.

00:15:37.990 --> 00:15:40.140
We have to look at adaptation.

00:15:40.140 --> 00:15:41.700
Adaptation means,
we see that also we

00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:43.910
have to how to adapt
to this climate change.

00:15:43.910 --> 00:15:45.320
So mitigation can be expensive.

00:15:45.320 --> 00:15:47.290
Adaptation should
come in together.

00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:49.070
And I think the most
challenging part is

00:15:49.070 --> 00:15:51.090
that mind change, the mindset.

00:15:51.090 --> 00:15:56.630
How do you promote low carbon
society to the local society

00:15:56.630 --> 00:16:00.670
so that they have the mind
change, the mindset changing

00:16:00.670 --> 00:16:04.680
from very high consumption
to a low consumption society?

00:16:04.680 --> 00:16:07.630
So by doing that they
could cut down their waste.

00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:09.490
They could cut down
their consumption,

00:16:09.490 --> 00:16:12.020
and they could actually
improve their quality of life,

00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:15.960
even without having a
very high consumption.

00:16:15.960 --> 00:16:19.250
So I think mindset
change is very important.

00:16:19.250 --> 00:16:21.670
That's why in our
campaign we started,

00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.690
we call it, low carbon society.

00:16:23.690 --> 00:16:25.580
We didn't call it
low carbon city.

00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:28.790
TU FAN: In developing countries,
the government and the citizens

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:32.690
are equally for ways
to grow economically,

00:16:32.690 --> 00:16:36.680
but at the same time, protect
environment and mitigate

00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:39.500
global climate challenges.

00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.970
Critics of green
technology is that it's

00:16:43.970 --> 00:16:47.540
a very expensive investment
for developing countries,

00:16:47.540 --> 00:16:50.960
and that it's not easy
to get access and adopt

00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.580
because of knowledge barriers.

00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:56.770
From 2009, Malaysia
has taken steps

00:16:56.770 --> 00:16:59.610
to implement green technology.

00:16:59.610 --> 00:17:01.916
Each step has not been easy.

00:17:01.916 --> 00:17:06.010
The Malaysia experience with
promoting green technology

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:09.381
can provide insights for
other developing and developed

00:17:09.381 --> 00:17:09.880
countries.

00:17:09.880 --> 00:17:14.574
