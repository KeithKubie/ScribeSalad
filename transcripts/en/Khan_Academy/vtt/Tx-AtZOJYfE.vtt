00:00:00.396 --> 00:00:04.326
- We have this big
moment and the moment is

00:00:04.326 --> 00:00:05.159
that for

00:00:06.315 --> 00:00:09.315
35 years of my teaching career

00:00:10.472 --> 00:00:14.622
I walked into the classroom having no idea

00:00:14.622 --> 00:00:17.402
if the kids had done the homework

00:00:17.402 --> 00:00:18.735
or

00:00:20.235 --> 00:00:23.997
what their commitment was to the subject.

00:00:23.997 --> 00:00:27.397
And then suddenly there's
this coaching platform

00:00:27.397 --> 00:00:31.531
on Khan Academy that was a
total game-changer for me.

00:00:31.531 --> 00:00:33.698
I wasn't imagining

00:00:34.731 --> 00:00:36.478
that the Khan Academy

00:00:36.478 --> 00:00:38.895
calculus content would become

00:00:42.997 --> 00:00:46.445
a big part of our curriculum.

00:00:46.445 --> 00:00:48.945
I imagined frankly and wrongly

00:00:50.167 --> 00:00:52.946
that we'd use these exercises,

00:00:52.946 --> 00:00:56.244
suggest kids use it for review.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:58.917
And when we discovered
the coaching platform

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:01.782
and how powerful that was,

00:01:01.782 --> 00:01:05.068
a group of us said,

00:01:05.068 --> 00:01:06.051
"Let's give it a go.

00:01:06.051 --> 00:01:08.468
"Let's try using Khan Academy

00:01:10.023 --> 00:01:12.492
"as a major part of our curriculum."

00:01:12.492 --> 00:01:16.159
And my goodness, it
changed the way I teach.

00:01:18.136 --> 00:01:23.009
For instance, five minutes
before I walk into class,

00:01:23.009 --> 00:01:24.077
I can go to the platform

00:01:24.077 --> 00:01:26.613
and I can look through my list of students

00:01:26.613 --> 00:01:29.312
to discover that all but two of them

00:01:29.312 --> 00:01:33.145
had done the homework,
had watched the videos,

00:01:34.471 --> 00:01:36.551
had cleared the hurdle, if you will,

00:01:36.551 --> 00:01:39.373
of the exercises that I had given them.

00:01:39.373 --> 00:01:41.744
So, when I walked in the room,

00:01:41.744 --> 00:01:44.442
I didn't have to go over homework anymore.

00:01:44.442 --> 00:01:46.109
That was liberating.

00:01:48.867 --> 00:01:50.179
So, if there were two students

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:51.282
who didn't do the homework,

00:01:51.282 --> 00:01:55.048
it gave me the opportunity
to pull them aside

00:01:55.048 --> 00:01:57.669
and say, "Hey, I see
you didn't get to it,"

00:01:57.669 --> 00:02:00.372
or, "I see you struggled with it.

00:02:00.372 --> 00:02:03.563
"Is there a way that you
and I can meet later today?

00:02:03.563 --> 00:02:07.494
"It's because I don't want
you to get behind in this."

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:09.418
The first 15 minutes of class now

00:02:09.418 --> 00:02:11.096
all the sudden we're breaking new ground.

00:02:11.096 --> 00:02:13.429
We're doing harder problems.

00:02:16.268 --> 00:02:18.734
The kids responded so well to it

00:02:18.734 --> 00:02:21.244
because I think they had
years and years and years

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:23.229
of math teachers going over the homework

00:02:23.229 --> 00:02:26.270
for the first 15 minutes of class.

00:02:26.270 --> 00:02:28.671
The poor kids must've been bored to death,

00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:31.122
or, "Why bother doing the homework

00:02:31.122 --> 00:02:34.004
because he'll do it on the board anyway?"

00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.224
That was just totally liberating

00:02:37.224 --> 00:02:40.882
and gave me an opportunity to really

00:02:40.882 --> 00:02:43.382
think hard about teaching.

00:02:44.305 --> 00:02:46.473
Since we started using Khan Academy,

00:02:46.473 --> 00:02:49.623
the one thing that we can't help

00:02:49.623 --> 00:02:53.705
but notice is that we're having more kids

00:02:53.705 --> 00:02:55.750
make it to the end of BC Calculus,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:59.105
and it's clear to me that we're having

00:02:59.105 --> 00:03:02.997
more girls and more underrepresented kids

00:03:02.997 --> 00:03:07.164
finish our BC Calculus class
than we ever did before.

00:03:08.154 --> 00:03:09.821
I gotta believe it's

00:03:11.389 --> 00:03:13.638
our new way about thinking about teaching.

00:03:13.638 --> 00:03:16.997
And using Khan Academy in the classroom

00:03:16.997 --> 00:03:18.738
and for homework assignments

00:03:18.738 --> 00:03:21.405
has gotta be a big part of that.
