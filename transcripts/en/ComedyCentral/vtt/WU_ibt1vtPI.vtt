00:00:01.201 --> 00:00:04.537
So, if President Trump looks
happy today, it's not because

00:00:04.570 --> 00:00:07.340
Putin finally accepted
his Facebook friend request.

00:00:07.373 --> 00:00:09.876
-(laughter) -It's because
his two favorite things--

00:00:09.909 --> 00:00:12.478
Twitter and live TV--
are merging.

00:00:12.511 --> 00:00:14.047
-(imitates explosions)
-(audience sighing and gasping)

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:16.382
I don't know why the
Twitter bird always just looks

00:00:16.415 --> 00:00:18.151
like someone put a finger
up its ass.

00:00:18.184 --> 00:00:20.019
(laughter)

00:00:20.052 --> 00:00:23.289
-Tweet, tweet.
-(laughter)

00:00:23.322 --> 00:00:25.224
Twitter just announced

00:00:25.257 --> 00:00:28.261
that it plans to stream live TV
24 hours a day, guys.

00:00:28.294 --> 00:00:30.930
Because they...
Oh, you don't seem...?

00:00:30.963 --> 00:00:32.565
(laughter)

00:00:32.598 --> 00:00:35.234
Their reaction was like,
"Oh, so why would they do that?"

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:37.070
-(laughter)
-They want to be 100% sure

00:00:37.103 --> 00:00:39.072
that they occupy all
of your attention while pooping.

00:00:39.105 --> 00:00:41.107
I don't know
why they're doing it it.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:43.443
-(laughter)
-Twitter CEO said their goal is

00:00:43.476 --> 00:00:45.178
to become something
always if the background

00:00:45.211 --> 00:00:48.481
of people's daily lives,
like CNBC in airports, or...

00:00:48.514 --> 00:00:50.249
or maybe wondering
if Carla was the one for you,

00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:52.085
and maybe you made
the biggest mistake of your life

00:00:52.118 --> 00:00:53.486
this whole time
getting on that plane.

00:00:53.519 --> 00:00:55.188
I mean, sure, you love Barbara,

00:00:55.221 --> 00:00:57.290
and you've been
through a lot of stuff together,

00:00:57.323 --> 00:00:59.358
but she isn't about passion.

00:00:59.391 --> 00:01:01.260
It's all about maintenance
at this point,

00:01:01.293 --> 00:01:02.695
and you have needs, too!

00:01:02.728 --> 00:01:03.963
What about your needs?!

00:01:03.996 --> 00:01:05.565
-Anyway...
-HENRY ZEBROWSKI: Yeah.

00:01:05.598 --> 00:01:08.167
-(applause and cheering)
-Yeah. Get on that plane.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:09.202
HARDWICK:
So...

00:01:09.235 --> 00:01:11.003
why don't...?

00:01:11.036 --> 00:01:14.640
So, Twitter is making a big
gamble with this content shift

00:01:14.673 --> 00:01:16.709
by assuming that their audience
has the attention span

00:01:16.742 --> 00:01:19.312
to follow anything longer
than a hashtag,

00:01:19.345 --> 00:01:20.980
"Brave picture
of Demi Lovato's face."

00:01:21.013 --> 00:01:22.415
-(laughter)
-So, comedians,

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.851
what's one of the shows
that we might see on Twitter TV?

00:01:24.884 --> 00:01:27.553
-Henry. -The Real Dank Memes
 of Tallahassee.

00:01:27.586 --> 00:01:30.022
-HARDWICK: Points.
-(laughter, applause)

00:01:30.055 --> 00:01:31.624
Ophira.

00:01:31.657 --> 00:01:33.659
 Say Yes to the Bless.

00:01:33.692 --> 00:01:36.129
-Yes, points.
-(applause and cheering)

00:01:36.162 --> 00:01:39.265
-Maria Bamford.
 -NCIS: Twitter,

00:01:39.298 --> 00:01:41.098
144 characters per episode.
