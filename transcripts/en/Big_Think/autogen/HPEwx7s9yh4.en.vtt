think about that or if they have done
something bad and you can say we

00:01:58.190 --> 00:01:58.200
something bad and you can say we
 

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.350
something bad and you can say we
identified the gene that led to this

00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:00.360
identified the gene that led to this
 

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:03.410

personality disorder you know how does

that get them off if they killed six
 

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:07.639
that get them off if they killed six
people or something in a way so that I

00:02:07.639 --> 00:02:07.649
people or something in a way so that I
 

00:02:07.649 --> 00:02:09.090
people or something in a way so that I
think is one big area

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:09.100
think is one big area
 

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:11.130
