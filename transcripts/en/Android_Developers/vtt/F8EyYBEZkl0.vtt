CHRIS LEI: Building the next
great Android app isn't enough.

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.710
You can have the most amazing
social integration, best API

00:00:06.710 --> 00:00:09.030
coverage, and the coolest
filters, but none of that

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.062
matters if your app is slow
and frustrating to use.

00:00:12.062 --> 00:00:14.270
And that's why Udacity and
Google created the Android

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:16.170
Performance Course
to help you learn

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.650
how to make fast, smooth, and
awesome experiences for users.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:21.400
The course reviews the
performance pillars

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:24.276
of rendering, compute,
memory, and battery.

00:00:24.276 --> 00:00:25.900
And it uses the tools
in Android Studio

00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:28.175
to find and fix
performance problems.

00:00:28.175 --> 00:00:29.800
By the end of course,
you'll understand

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.090
how common performance problems
arise from your hardware, OS,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:34.720
and application code.

00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:36.710
And using profiling
tools to gather data,

00:00:36.710 --> 00:00:38.730
you'll identify and fix
performance bottlenecks,

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.020
so users can have that smooth,
60-frames-per-second experience

00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:45.370
that will keep them
coming back for more.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:47.710
