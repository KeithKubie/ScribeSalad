was really entrepreneurial because it

one<00:00:52.640><c> of</c><00:00:52.760><c> the</c><00:00:52.820><c> biggest</c><00:00:53.000><c> problems</c><00:00:53.600><c> is</c><00:00:53.809><c> that</c><00:00:53.840><c> the</c>

00:00:54.250 --> 00:00:54.260 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems is that the
 

00:00:54.260 --> 00:00:56.740 align:start position:0%
one of the biggest problems is that the
UAW<00:00:54.860><c> negotiated</c><00:00:55.760><c> for</c><00:00:55.940><c> health</c><00:00:56.180><c> and</c><00:00:56.480><c> pension</c>

UAW negotiated for health and pension
 

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:00.340 align:start position:0%
UAW negotiated for health and pension
and<00:00:57.289><c> then</c><00:00:57.920><c> it</c><00:00:58.070><c> was</c><00:00:58.219><c> delivered</c><00:00:58.730><c> by</c><00:00:59.239><c> you</c><00:01:00.230><c> know</c>

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:00.350 align:start position:0%
and then it was delivered by you know
 

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:03.040 align:start position:0%
and then it was delivered by you know
big<00:01:01.039><c> insurance</c><00:01:01.340><c> carriers</c><00:01:02.270><c> and</c><00:01:02.510><c> the</c><00:01:02.899><c> big</c>

00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:03.050 align:start position:0%
big insurance carriers and the big
 

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.770 align:start position:0%
big insurance carriers and the big
problem<00:01:03.530><c> is</c><00:01:03.649><c> this</c><00:01:03.949><c> runaway</c><00:01:04.670><c> costs</c><00:01:05.149><c> and</c><00:01:05.600><c> the</c>

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:05.780 align:start position:0%
problem is this runaway costs and the
 

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.749 align:start position:0%
problem is this runaway costs and the
inflation<00:01:06.380><c> associated</c><00:01:06.979><c> with</c><00:01:07.160><c> health</c><00:01:07.490><c> care</c>

00:01:07.749 --> 00:01:07.759 align:start position:0%
inflation associated with health care
 

00:01:07.759 --> 00:01:11.650 align:start position:0%
inflation associated with health care
and<00:01:08.030><c> so</c><00:01:09.490><c> that's</c><00:01:10.490><c> one</c><00:01:10.789><c> of</c><00:01:10.910><c> the</c><00:01:10.970><c> reasons</c><00:01:11.240><c> why</c><00:01:11.360><c> it</c>

00:01:11.650 --> 00:01:11.660 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the reasons why it
 

00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.109 align:start position:0%
and so that's one of the reasons why it
became<00:01:11.899><c> very</c><00:01:11.960><c> expensive</c><00:01:12.649><c> if</c><00:01:12.800><c> let's</c><00:01:13.369><c> say</c><00:01:13.490><c> there</c>

00:01:14.109 --> 00:01:14.119 align:start position:0%
became very expensive if let's say there
 

00:01:14.119 --> 00:01:17.440 align:start position:0%
became very expensive if let's say there
were<00:01:14.509><c> clinics</c><00:01:15.500><c> and</c><00:01:15.800><c> they</c><00:01:16.429><c> were</c><00:01:16.490><c> run</c><00:01:16.819><c> by</c><00:01:16.849><c> nurse</c>

00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:17.450 align:start position:0%
were clinics and they were run by nurse
 

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.449 align:start position:0%
were clinics and they were run by nurse
