slopes of nonlinear functions you saw

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:48.090
slopes of nonlinear functions you saw
 

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.979
slopes of nonlinear functions you saw
earlier that linear functions have very

00:03:51.979 --> 00:03:51.989
earlier that linear functions have very
 

00:03:51.989 --> 00:03:55.090
earlier that linear functions have very
simple slopes they have constant slopes

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100
simple slopes they have constant slopes
 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.740
simple slopes they have constant slopes
nonlinear functions by definition do not

00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:57.750
nonlinear functions by definition do not
 

00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:00.289
nonlinear functions by definition do not
have constant slopes their slopes change

00:04:00.289 --> 00:04:00.299
have constant slopes their slopes change
 

00:04:00.299 --> 00:04:04.520
have constant slopes their slopes change

little more complicated but calculus is

00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:13.950
little more complicated but calculus is
 

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.640

that's all it is so if you are asked in
 

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.450
that's all it is so if you are asked in
future why do we care about calculus

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:26.460

that point so let's put X here in the

00:05:25.610 --> 00:05:25.620
that point so let's put X here in the
 

00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:29.390

last session I referred to the vertical

00:05:29.390 --> 00:05:29.400
last session I referred to the vertical
 

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.530
last session I referred to the vertical
axis is why okay often we'll also refer

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540
axis is why okay often we'll also refer
 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:39.110
axis is why okay often we'll also refer
to it as f of X okay so this is the

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:39.120
to it as f of X okay so this is the
 

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.580
to it as f of X okay so this is the
independent variable this is the

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:40.590
independent variable this is the
 

00:05:40.590 --> 00:05:44.230
independent variable this is the
dependent variable the function of X and

00:05:44.230 --> 00:05:44.240
dependent variable the function of X and
 

00:05:44.240 --> 00:05:54.020
dependent variable the function of X and
this curve is a graph and remember what

00:05:54.020 --> 00:05:54.030
this curve is a graph and remember what
 

00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:59.390
this curve is a graph and remember what
the graph is anybody want to tell us

00:05:59.390 --> 00:05:59.400
the graph is anybody want to tell us
 

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:08.030
the graph is anybody want to tell us
what a graph of a function is

00:06:08.030 --> 00:06:08.040
 
 

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:11.480
 
okay so you're close it's a line that

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490
okay so you're close it's a line that
 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:16.550
okay so you're close it's a line that
connects all pairs of points X comma f

00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:16.560
connects all pairs of points X comma f
 

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.110

relationship between the two or that

00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:23.970
relationship between the two or that
 

00:06:23.970 --> 00:06:26.360
relationship between the two or that
satisfy the equation that describes the

functional relationship between the two
 

00:06:28.220 --> 00:06:33.110
functional relationship between the two
so this is the graph of a function so

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:33.120
so this is the graph of a function so
 

00:06:33.120 --> 00:06:35.570
so this is the graph of a function so
every point on this line or on this

00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:35.580
every point on this line or on this
 

00:06:35.580 --> 00:06:40.550
every point on this line or on this

locus satisfies the functional
 

00:06:40.560 --> 00:06:43.850
locus satisfies the functional
relationship between X and Y or the

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:43.860
relationship between X and Y or the
 

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.300
relationship between X and Y or the
function of X okay now if I take a point

00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:47.310
function of X okay now if I take a point
 

00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:54.140
function of X okay now if I take a point
an arbitrary point let's say X star from

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:54.150
an arbitrary point let's say X star from
 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:58.520
an arbitrary point let's say X star from
all these possible values of the

00:06:58.520 --> 00:06:58.530
all these possible values of the
 

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:00.830
all these possible values of the
independent variable and I ask well

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:00.840
independent variable and I ask well
 

00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:02.780
independent variable and I ask well
what's the value of the function at that

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:02.790
what's the value of the function at that
 

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:08.750
what's the value of the function at that
point ok so this and it might help to

00:07:08.750 --> 00:07:08.760
point ok so this and it might help to
 

00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.780
point ok so this and it might help to
think of X as something particular let's

00:07:11.780 --> 00:07:11.790
think of X as something particular let's
 

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.120
think of X as something particular let's
say if you are concerned with yields

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:17.130
say if you are concerned with yields
 

00:07:17.130 --> 00:07:20.480
say if you are concerned with yields
this could be fertilizer input and this

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:20.490
this could be fertilizer input and this
 

00:07:20.490 --> 00:07:31.030
this could be fertilizer input and this
could be yield per hectare

00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:31.040
 
 

00:07:31.040 --> 00:07:38.470
 
okay this value will calling f of X star

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:38.480
okay this value will calling f of X star
 

00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:43.010
okay this value will calling f of X star
okay so this could be 10 pounds of

00:07:43.010 --> 00:07:43.020
okay so this could be 10 pounds of
 

00:07:43.020 --> 00:07:47.510
okay so this could be 10 pounds of
fertilizer per square meter and this

00:07:47.510 --> 00:07:47.520
fertilizer per square meter and this
 

00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:50.480
fertilizer per square meter and this
could be certain number of bushels of

00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:50.490
could be certain number of bushels of
 

00:07:50.490 --> 00:07:56.120
could be certain number of bushels of
corn let's say okay at that point this

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:56.130
corn let's say okay at that point this
 

00:07:56.130 --> 00:07:59.870
corn let's say okay at that point this
point has the Cartesian coordinates X

00:07:59.870 --> 00:07:59.880

star f of X star okay in the last

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:08.040
star f of X star okay in the last
 

00:08:08.040 --> 00:08:09.770
star f of X star okay in the last
session I might have referred to this

00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:09.780
session I might have referred to this
 

00:08:09.780 --> 00:08:16.430
session I might have referred to this
point as 23 let's say okay now the

00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:16.440
point as 23 let's say okay now the
 

00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:21.410
point as 23 let's say okay now the
tangent line to the function is the line

00:08:21.410 --> 00:08:21.420
tangent line to the function is the line
 

00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:25.660
tangent line to the function is the line
is the straight line would just touches

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:25.670
is the straight line would just touches
 

00:08:25.670 --> 00:08:30.620
is the straight line would just touches
the function at just that point and

00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:30.630
the function at just that point and
 

00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:36.130
the function at just that point and
nowhere else or nowhere else nearby okay

00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:36.140
nowhere else or nowhere else nearby okay
 

00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.990
nowhere else or nowhere else nearby okay
and of course since this is a straight

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:39.000
and of course since this is a straight
 

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.630
and of course since this is a straight
line it has a constant slope and that

00:08:44.630 --> 00:08:44.640
line it has a constant slope and that
 

00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.650
line it has a constant slope and that
constant slope is by definition the

00:08:51.650 --> 00:08:51.660
constant slope is by definition the
 

00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:58.850
constant slope is by definition the
slope of f of X at X star but if i took

00:08:58.850 --> 00:08:58.860
slope of f of X at X star but if i took
 

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.330
slope of f of X at X star but if i took
some other point instead of x star if I

00:09:02.330 --> 00:09:02.340
some other point instead of x star if I
 

00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:06.940
some other point instead of x star if I
took some other point let's say X hat

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:06.950
took some other point let's say X hat
 

00:09:06.950 --> 00:09:09.710
took some other point let's say X hat
then the function has a slightly

00:09:09.710 --> 00:09:09.720
then the function has a slightly
 

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:13.880
then the function has a slightly
different slope okay in this case at X

00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:13.890
different slope okay in this case at X
 

00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.140
different slope okay in this case at X
hat is the function steeper or shallower

00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:18.150
hat is the function steeper or shallower
 

00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.730
hat is the function steeper or shallower
than at X star steeper right so this

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:22.740
than at X star steeper right so this
 

00:09:22.740 --> 00:09:25.850
than at X star steeper right so this
function is getting steeper as x

00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:25.860
function is getting steeper as x
 

00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:33.770
function is getting steeper as x
increases okay yes so the this tangent

00:09:33.770 --> 00:09:33.780
increases okay yes so the this tangent
 

00:09:33.780 --> 00:09:35.930
increases okay yes so the this tangent
is a straight line it has a constant

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:35.940
is a straight line it has a constant
 

00:09:35.940 --> 00:09:40.220
is a straight line it has a constant
slope that slope the the number the

00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:40.230
slope that slope the the number the
 

00:09:40.230 --> 00:09:44.300
slope that slope the the number the
constant number that you get

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:44.310
constant number that you get
 

00:09:44.310 --> 00:09:47.720
constant number that you get
that number is the slope of the function

00:09:47.720 --> 00:09:47.730
that number is the slope of the function
 

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:56.210
that number is the slope of the function
f of X at X star there's a different

00:09:56.210 --> 00:09:56.220
f of X at X star there's a different
 

00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.890
f of X at X star there's a different
number that is the slope of the function

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:57.900
number that is the slope of the function
 

00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:09.500
number that is the slope of the function
f of X at X hat now yes the x star

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:09.510
f of X at X hat now yes the x star
 

00:10:09.510 --> 00:10:11.900
f of X at X hat now yes the x star
that's a good question the X star is a

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:11.910
that's a good question the X star is a
 

00:10:11.910 --> 00:10:16.040
that's a good question the X star is a
particular value of x from all possible

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:16.050
particular value of x from all possible
 

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.440
particular value of x from all possible
values of X for example you know it this

00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:21.450
values of X for example you know it this
 

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:24.980
values of X for example you know it this
might have been the number two okay so

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:24.990
might have been the number two okay so
 

00:10:24.990 --> 00:10:27.410
might have been the number two okay so
that this is a good question because you

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:27.420
that this is a good question because you
 

00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.750
that this is a good question because you
want to clear this up and it's a very

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:29.760
want to clear this up and it's a very
 

00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:38.710
want to clear this up and it's a very
common a very common point of confusion

00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:38.720
common a very common point of confusion
 

00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:43.130
common a very common point of confusion
X is a variable for example as you said

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:43.140
X is a variable for example as you said
 

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:46.880
X is a variable for example as you said
fertilizer input to the concept it's a

00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:46.890
fertilizer input to the concept it's a
 

00:10:46.890 --> 00:10:51.770
fertilizer input to the concept it's a
measurable concept right that's X X star

00:10:51.770 --> 00:10:51.780
measurable concept right that's X X star
 

00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:58.240
measurable concept right that's X X star
on the other hand is a number that

00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:58.250
 
 

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.000
 
describes a particular value of that

00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.010
describes a particular value of that
 

00:11:02.010 --> 00:11:05.150
describes a particular value of that
concept so X you can think of as

00:11:05.150 --> 00:11:05.160
concept so X you can think of as
 

00:11:05.160 --> 00:11:10.130
concept so X you can think of as
fertilizer in put an X star could be two

00:11:10.130 --> 00:11:10.140
fertilizer in put an X star could be two
 

00:11:10.140 --> 00:11:13.820
fertilizer in put an X star could be two
pounds of fertilizer input per square

00:11:13.820 --> 00:11:13.830
pounds of fertilizer input per square
 

00:11:13.830 --> 00:11:18.620
pounds of fertilizer input per square
meter the number two would represent X

00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:18.630
meter the number two would represent X
 

00:11:18.630 --> 00:11:26.270
meter the number two would represent X
star and indeed you know if it would be

00:11:26.270 --> 00:11:26.280
star and indeed you know if it would be
 

00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:29.090
star and indeed you know if it would be
far less confusing if instead of saying

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.100
far less confusing if instead of saying
 

00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:33.110
far less confusing if instead of saying
X star and X hat I use the number 2 for

00:11:33.110 --> 00:11:33.120
X star and X hat I use the number 2 for
 

00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.690
X star and X hat I use the number 2 for
X star and the number 3 for X hat but I

00:11:37.690 --> 00:11:37.700
X star and the number 3 for X hat but I
 

00:11:37.700 --> 00:11:41.000
X star and the number 3 for X hat but I
want you to go beyond the specific

00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:41.010
want you to go beyond the specific
 

00:11:41.010 --> 00:11:43.100
want you to go beyond the specific
numbers because of course when you do

00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:43.110
numbers because of course when you do
 

00:11:43.110 --> 00:11:47.590
numbers because of course when you do
this analysis it could be any number and

00:11:47.590 --> 00:11:47.600
this analysis it could be any number and
 

00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:49.970
this analysis it could be any number and
input not only could it be any number

00:11:49.970 --> 00:11:49.980
input not only could it be any number
 

00:11:49.980 --> 00:11:51.949
input not only could it be any number
but in particular you will be doing

00:11:51.949 --> 00:11:51.959
but in particular you will be doing
 

00:11:51.959 --> 00:11:54.250
but in particular you will be doing
analysis when you don't actually know

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:54.260
analysis when you don't actually know
 

00:11:54.260 --> 00:11:59.750
analysis when you don't actually know
the types of numbers that might be in

00:11:59.750 --> 00:11:59.760
 
 

00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.690
 
so that's why that's the leap that you

00:12:03.690 --> 00:12:03.700
so that's why that's the leap that you
 

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:07.770
so that's why that's the leap that you
have to make now okay or or it is part

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:07.780
have to make now okay or or it is part
 

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:13.890
have to make now okay or or it is part
of this process okay and just to address

00:12:13.890 --> 00:12:13.900
of this process okay and just to address
 

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:16.050
of this process okay and just to address
that question a little bit further f of

00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:36.400
hectare for example this could be four
 

00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:42.810
hectare for example this could be four
bushels of corn per hectare okay if your

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:42.820
bushels of corn per hectare okay if your
 

00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:44.670
bushels of corn per hectare okay if your
functional relationship says that by

00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:44.680
functional relationship says that by
 

00:12:44.680 --> 00:12:47.310
functional relationship says that by
putting in two units of fertilizer you

00:12:47.310 --> 00:12:47.320
putting in two units of fertilizer you
 

00:12:47.320 --> 00:12:51.840
putting in two units of fertilizer you
get four bushels of corn then X star

00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:51.850
get four bushels of corn then X star
 

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:58.370
get four bushels of corn then X star
would be 2 and f of X star would be four

00:12:58.370 --> 00:12:58.380
 
 

00:12:58.380 --> 00:13:04.440
 
ok now the tangent line of course as we

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:04.450
ok now the tangent line of course as we
 

00:13:04.450 --> 00:13:11.150
ok now the tangent line of course as we
just said passes through X f of X now

00:13:11.150 --> 00:13:11.160
just said passes through X f of X now
 

00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.630
just said passes through X f of X now
here I had said X star comma f of X star

00:13:15.630 --> 00:13:15.640
here I had said X star comma f of X star
 

00:13:15.640 --> 00:13:20.220
here I had said X star comma f of X star
to denote a particular point now what I

00:13:20.220 --> 00:13:20.230
to denote a particular point now what I
 

00:13:20.230 --> 00:13:25.020
to denote a particular point now what I
want you to do is to imagine see I told

00:13:25.020 --> 00:13:25.030
want you to do is to imagine see I told
 

00:13:25.030 --> 00:13:28.140
want you to do is to imagine see I told
you that when I increase X from X star

00:13:28.140 --> 00:13:28.150
you that when I increase X from X star
 

00:13:28.150 --> 00:13:33.890
you that when I increase X from X star
to X hat the function gets steeper so

00:13:33.890 --> 00:13:33.900
to X hat the function gets steeper so
 

00:13:33.900 --> 00:13:37.950
to X hat the function gets steeper so
you know from the last session that when

00:13:37.950 --> 00:13:37.960
you know from the last session that when
 

00:13:37.960 --> 00:13:40.410
you know from the last session that when
the slope gets steeper what's happening

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:40.420
the slope gets steeper what's happening
 

00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.510
the slope gets steeper what's happening
to the number that describes the slope

00:13:44.510 --> 00:13:44.520
to the number that describes the slope
 

00:13:44.520 --> 00:13:48.750
to the number that describes the slope
it's going up right it's increasing okay

00:13:48.750 --> 00:13:48.760
it's going up right it's increasing okay
 

00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.500
it's going up right it's increasing okay
so in this case when I go from X star to

00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:52.510
so in this case when I go from X star to
 

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:55.770
so in this case when I go from X star to
X hat the slope of the function is going

00:13:55.770 --> 00:13:55.780
X hat the slope of the function is going
 

00:13:55.780 --> 00:14:01.950
X hat the slope of the function is going
to increase if I go from X hat to X star

00:14:01.950 --> 00:14:01.960
to increase if I go from X hat to X star
 

00:14:01.960 --> 00:14:03.680
to increase if I go from X hat to X star
the slope of the function will decrease

00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:03.690
the slope of the function will decrease
 

00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:07.340
the slope of the function will decrease
the slope of the function is itself

00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:07.350
the slope of the function is itself
 

00:14:07.350 --> 00:14:10.309
the slope of the function is itself
dependent on X

00:14:10.309 --> 00:14:10.319
dependent on X
 

00:14:10.319 --> 00:14:13.829
dependent on X
okay so that's a key insight that you

00:14:13.829 --> 00:14:13.839
okay so that's a key insight that you
 

00:14:13.839 --> 00:14:17.069
okay so that's a key insight that you
want to take away if that calculus uses

00:14:17.069 --> 00:14:17.079
want to take away if that calculus uses
 

00:14:17.079 --> 00:14:21.480
want to take away if that calculus uses
that is for a nonlinear function the

00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:21.490
that is for a nonlinear function the
 

00:14:21.490 --> 00:14:24.170
that is for a nonlinear function the
slope of that nonlinear function is

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:24.180
slope of that nonlinear function is
 

00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:29.879
slope of that nonlinear function is
itself a function of X that's not the

00:14:29.879 --> 00:14:29.889
itself a function of X that's not the
 

00:14:29.889 --> 00:14:32.309
itself a function of X that's not the
case for a linear function in a linear

00:14:32.309 --> 00:14:32.319
case for a linear function in a linear
 

00:14:32.319 --> 00:14:34.799
case for a linear function in a linear
function the slope of the linear

00:14:34.799 --> 00:14:34.809
function the slope of the linear
 

00:14:34.809 --> 00:14:43.199
function the slope of the linear
function is just a constant okay so here

00:14:43.199 --> 00:14:43.209
function is just a constant okay so here
 

00:14:43.209 --> 00:14:46.410
function is just a constant okay so here
I drew a tangent line at a particular

00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:46.420
I drew a tangent line at a particular
 

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:52.019
I drew a tangent line at a particular
point X star f of X star and on the

00:14:52.019 --> 00:14:52.029
point X star f of X star and on the
 

00:14:52.029 --> 00:15:01.970
point X star f of X star and on the
screen I've called this point X f of X

00:15:01.970 --> 00:15:01.980
screen I've called this point X f of X
 

00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:05.850
screen I've called this point X f of X
because of course that X star could be

00:15:05.850 --> 00:15:05.860
because of course that X star could be
 

00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:07.860
because of course that X star could be
anywhere this there could be an X star

00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:07.870
anywhere this there could be an X star
 

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:10.170
anywhere this there could be an X star
here there could be an X star here there

00:15:10.170 --> 00:15:10.180
here there could be an X star here there
 

00:15:10.180 --> 00:15:12.059
here there could be an X star here there
could be a next are here and so on so

00:15:12.059 --> 00:15:12.069
could be a next are here and so on so
 

00:15:12.069 --> 00:15:16.079
could be a next are here and so on so
you can think of any of these points as

00:15:16.079 --> 00:15:16.089
you can think of any of these points as
 

00:15:16.089 --> 00:15:21.329
you can think of any of these points as
being collections of points X and f of X

00:15:21.329 --> 00:15:21.339
being collections of points X and f of X
 

00:15:21.339 --> 00:15:23.249
being collections of points X and f of X
and you could draw a tangent at any of

00:15:23.249 --> 00:15:23.259
and you could draw a tangent at any of
 

00:15:23.259 --> 00:15:26.100
and you could draw a tangent at any of
those points and that tangent would have

00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:26.110
those points and that tangent would have
 

00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:34.669
those points and that tangent would have
a slope okay so now if I wanted to

00:15:34.669 --> 00:15:34.679
a slope okay so now if I wanted to
 

00:15:34.679 --> 00:15:40.049
a slope okay so now if I wanted to
describe for this nonlinear function if

00:15:40.049 --> 00:15:40.059
describe for this nonlinear function if
 

00:15:40.059 --> 00:15:43.919
describe for this nonlinear function if
I wanted to describe the slope at every

00:15:43.919 --> 00:15:43.929
I wanted to describe the slope at every
 

00:15:43.929 --> 00:15:47.369
I wanted to describe the slope at every
point I could sit down and draw lots of

00:15:47.369 --> 00:15:47.379
point I could sit down and draw lots of
 

00:15:47.379 --> 00:15:49.970
point I could sit down and draw lots of
tangent lines and compute the slope and

00:15:49.970 --> 00:15:49.980
tangent lines and compute the slope and
 

00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:54.439
tangent lines and compute the slope and
people did that three thousand years ago

00:15:54.439 --> 00:15:54.449
people did that three thousand years ago
 

00:15:54.449 --> 00:15:56.970
people did that three thousand years ago
actually people did that four hundred

00:15:56.970 --> 00:15:56.980
actually people did that four hundred
 

00:15:56.980 --> 00:16:04.379
actually people did that four hundred
years ago okay and you know and it's not

00:16:04.379 --> 00:16:04.389
years ago okay and you know and it's not
 

00:16:04.389 --> 00:16:06.660
years ago okay and you know and it's not
nothing to be laughed at because all

00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:06.670
nothing to be laughed at because all
 

00:16:06.670 --> 00:16:09.119
nothing to be laughed at because all
sorts of insights were derived even from

00:16:09.119 --> 00:16:09.129
sorts of insights were derived even from
 

00:16:09.129 --> 00:16:11.160
sorts of insights were derived even from
that type of work right I mean people

00:16:11.160 --> 00:16:11.170
that type of work right I mean people
 

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.860
that type of work right I mean people
worked out that the world was round just

00:16:13.860 --> 00:16:13.870
worked out that the world was round just
 

00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:19.280
worked out that the world was round just
from doing that without calculus okay

00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:19.290
from doing that without calculus okay
 

00:16:19.290 --> 00:16:24.180
from doing that without calculus okay
but the

00:16:24.180 --> 00:16:24.190
 
 

00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:29.170
 
but now suppose that we want a more

00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:29.180
but now suppose that we want a more
 

00:16:29.180 --> 00:16:33.270
but now suppose that we want a more
compact way of analyzing the

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:33.280
compact way of analyzing the
 

00:16:33.280 --> 00:16:37.020
compact way of analyzing the
relationship between X and the slope

00:16:37.020 --> 00:16:37.030
relationship between X and the slope
 

00:16:37.030 --> 00:16:42.370
relationship between X and the slope
okay well you know what you could do

00:16:42.370 --> 00:16:42.380
okay well you know what you could do
 

00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:44.920
okay well you know what you could do
since you learnt about different ways to

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:44.930
since you learnt about different ways to
 

00:16:44.930 --> 00:16:47.260
since you learnt about different ways to
construct functions last time you could

00:16:47.260 --> 00:16:47.270
construct functions last time you could
 

00:16:47.270 --> 00:16:49.720
construct functions last time you could
compute lots of different values of x

00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:49.730
compute lots of different values of x
 

00:16:49.730 --> 00:16:52.840
compute lots of different values of x
the associated slopes along the values

00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:52.850
the associated slopes along the values
 

00:16:52.850 --> 00:16:59.100
the associated slopes along the values
using the tangents put it in a table and

00:16:59.100 --> 00:16:59.110
 
 

00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:03.760
 
graph it okay and what do you think the

00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:03.770
graph it okay and what do you think the
 

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:08.949
graph it okay and what do you think the
graph of a function that gives you the

00:17:08.949 --> 00:17:08.959
graph of a function that gives you the
 

00:17:08.959 --> 00:17:11.710
graph of a function that gives you the
slope of this function for different

00:17:11.710 --> 00:17:11.720
slope of this function for different
 

00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.870
slope of this function for different
values of x what do you think that would

00:17:13.870 --> 00:17:13.880
values of x what do you think that would
 

00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:20.490
values of x what do you think that would
look like yes you what's your name sorry

00:17:20.490 --> 00:17:20.500
look like yes you what's your name sorry
 

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:28.240
look like yes you what's your name sorry
desirae yes of course okay a line

00:17:28.240 --> 00:17:28.250
desirae yes of course okay a line
 

00:17:28.250 --> 00:17:34.810
desirae yes of course okay a line
beginning at 0 slipping up but perhaps

00:17:34.810 --> 00:17:34.820
beginning at 0 slipping up but perhaps
 

00:17:34.820 --> 00:17:36.790
beginning at 0 slipping up but perhaps
you could tell your colleagues what

00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:36.800
you could tell your colleagues what
 

00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:59.160
you could tell your colleagues what
makes you say that like that

00:17:59.160 --> 00:17:59.170
 
 

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:05.430
 
okay so Desiree is absolutely right at

00:18:05.430 --> 00:18:05.440
okay so Desiree is absolutely right at
 

00:18:05.440 --> 00:18:08.740
okay so Desiree is absolutely right at
actually it doesn't necessarily it

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:08.750
actually it doesn't necessarily it
 

00:18:08.750 --> 00:18:10.900
actually it doesn't necessarily it
doesn't have to start at the origin it

00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:10.910
doesn't have to start at the origin it
 

00:18:10.910 --> 00:18:24.520
doesn't have to start at the origin it
could it could look like this okay yeah

00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:24.530
could it could look like this okay yeah
 

00:18:24.530 --> 00:18:26.680
could it could look like this okay yeah
we just we don't we don't know what

00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:26.690
we just we don't we don't know what
 

00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.740
we just we don't we don't know what
happens to the function out here but

00:18:29.740 --> 00:18:29.750
happens to the function out here but
 

00:18:29.750 --> 00:18:31.630
happens to the function out here but
clearly this is a function that slopes

00:18:31.630 --> 00:18:31.640
clearly this is a function that slopes
 

00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:34.420
clearly this is a function that slopes
upwards which means it has positive

00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:34.430
upwards which means it has positive
 

00:18:34.430 --> 00:18:38.290
upwards which means it has positive
slope here at there's some point where

00:18:38.290 --> 00:18:38.300
slope here at there's some point where
 

00:18:38.300 --> 00:18:41.320
slope here at there's some point where
it we think that it might be flat that's

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:41.330
it we think that it might be flat that's
 

00:18:41.330 --> 00:18:45.370
it we think that it might be flat that's
the point where Desiree says the slope

00:18:45.370 --> 00:18:45.380
the point where Desiree says the slope
 

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.460
the point where Desiree says the slope
of that function is going to be zero and

00:18:47.460 --> 00:18:47.470
of that function is going to be zero and
 

00:18:47.470 --> 00:18:51.520
of that function is going to be zero and
as x increases it gets steeper which

00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:51.530
as x increases it gets steeper which
 

00:18:51.530 --> 00:18:58.180
as x increases it gets steeper which
means the slope gets higher now why do

00:18:58.180 --> 00:18:58.190
means the slope gets higher now why do
 

00:18:58.190 --> 00:19:00.280
means the slope gets higher now why do
you think that this is a straight line

00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:00.290
you think that this is a straight line
 

00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:10.470
you think that this is a straight line
going up sorry it doesn't change

00:19:10.470 --> 00:19:10.480
going up sorry it doesn't change
 

00:19:10.480 --> 00:19:13.000
going up sorry it doesn't change
actually we don't really know that it's

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:13.010
actually we don't really know that it's
 

00:19:13.010 --> 00:19:16.920
actually we don't really know that it's
a straight line given what I've told you

00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:16.930
a straight line given what I've told you
 

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:23.430
a straight line given what I've told you
it could for example for it not to have

00:19:23.430 --> 00:19:23.440
it could for example for it not to have
 

00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:26.680
it could for example for it not to have
an inflection point it could sort of go

00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:26.690
an inflection point it could sort of go
 

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:34.030
an inflection point it could sort of go
like that or it could go like that we

00:19:34.030 --> 00:19:34.040
like that or it could go like that we
 

00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:39.280
like that or it could go like that we
just don't know whether what will happen

00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:39.290
just don't know whether what will happen
 

00:19:39.290 --> 00:19:41.680
just don't know whether what will happen
further out but there's a good chance

00:19:41.680 --> 00:19:41.690
further out but there's a good chance
 

00:19:41.690 --> 00:19:45.070
further out but there's a good chance
that it could be a straight line okay

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:45.080
that it could be a straight line okay
