[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:11.850
SPEAKER 1: I am really excited
to introduce our next keynote

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.200
speaker.

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.330
Sydney Chaffee is the 2017
National Teacher of the Year.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:20.280
And that she was awarded--

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:23.784
we actually had the
opportunity to see

00:00:23.784 --> 00:00:25.950
that award being presented
to her at the White House

00:00:25.950 --> 00:00:27.280
earlier this year.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:28.090
She's fantastic.

00:00:28.090 --> 00:00:29.130
I've heard her
once before and was

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:31.004
thrilled to be able to
invite her to join us.

00:00:31.004 --> 00:00:34.290
She's actually flown all the way
out from Boston just for today

00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:37.590
and is headed off
tomorrow to space camp

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.540
as part of the National Teacher
of the Year Award program.

00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:44.070
Sydney has been a ninth
grade humanities teacher

00:00:44.070 --> 00:00:46.500
at Codman Academy Public
Charter School in Boston

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.330
for the past nine years.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:51.390
In the classroom, she strives to
create lessons that demonstrate

00:00:51.390 --> 00:00:53.490
how education can be
a transformative tool

00:00:53.490 --> 00:00:56.730
for social justice, and
she encourages her students

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.610
to see themselves as having
the power to make change

00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:02.250
in the world based on some
lessons from the past.

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:03.810
She tries to infuse
the hard work

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.430
of learning with joy not
only in her classroom

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:07.830
but throughout the school.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:09.330
For example, she's
the coordinator

00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:11.730
of a school-wide community
circle every Thursday

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:13.920
where all students in
the school come together

00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:16.950
to celebrate successes,
share good news,

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.160
and dig in to serious
conversations together.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:22.050
As the National
Teacher of the Year,

00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:25.830
Sydney is focusing on education
as a tool for social justice,

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:27.870
the value of theater
and the arts,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.990
and the importance of educators
taking instructional risks

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:32.292
to reach every student.

00:01:32.292 --> 00:01:33.750
Please join me in
welcoming Sydney.

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:37.159
[APPLAUSE]

00:01:43.003 --> 00:01:47.670
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: OK, good?

00:01:47.670 --> 00:01:49.410
Hi.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:50.790
You guys are fun.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.600
This is fun.

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:52.680
These are fun.

00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:54.560
All right, so I'm
going to use my notes

00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:55.560
because I'm new at this.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.110
I'm like a month into being
full time national teacher

00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:00.766
of the year, and I don't have
my speeches memorized yet.

00:02:00.766 --> 00:02:02.980
But I want to thank you
all for having me here.

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:04.521
I just want to
preface this by saying

00:02:04.521 --> 00:02:07.050
that when I arrived today and
I was happily eating my lunch,

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:10.470
AT came over and he was
like, hey, just so you know,

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:12.060
before lunch, we
have the best speaker

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.330
I've ever seen in my life.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:14.850
But, you know, no pressure.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:17.910
Just try to be not too bad.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.116
You won't be as good as him.

00:02:21.116 --> 00:02:23.550
So here I am, thank you.

00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:25.922
I'm really excited.

00:02:25.922 --> 00:02:27.630
All right, so I want
to talk to you today

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:30.690
about Vincent van Gogh--

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:32.010
just because.

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:35.430
So in September 1882,
van Gogh sent a letter

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:37.760
to his younger brother Theo.

00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:41.300
And he wrote, "I long so much
to make beautiful things.

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:45.030
But beautiful things require
effort and disappointment

00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:46.830
and perseverance."

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.980
And van Gogh knew a thing or two
about effort and disappointment

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:51.120
and perseverance.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.070
He struggled with
mental illness.

00:02:53.070 --> 00:02:56.170
And although he was obviously
a really talented artist,

00:02:56.170 --> 00:02:58.530
he was dismissed as insane.

00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:00.960
His brilliant paintings
didn't make him any money,

00:03:00.960 --> 00:03:03.840
and he relied on Theo, who was
four years younger than him,

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.910
to support him financially
so he could afford

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.220
to buy paint and canvases.

00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:11.260
But he didn't give up.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:12.760
Case in point.

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.620
So painting was
van Gogh's passion.

00:03:14.620 --> 00:03:17.800
He was driven to it despite
the adversity that he faced.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:21.140
He believed there was power in
pigments and canvases and brush

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.810
strokes.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.090
And he explained
to Theo, "The great

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:27.670
doesn't happen
through impulse alone

00:03:27.670 --> 00:03:29.800
and is a succession
of little things

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.834
that are brought together."

00:03:31.834 --> 00:03:33.250
And when I was
thinking about what

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.230
I wanted to say to
you all here today,

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:38.170
that idea stuck with me-- that
greatness or change doesn't

00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:39.940
just happen because
we want them to,

00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:43.090
but because we work toward
them incrementally I'm

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.240
reminded of that lesson
again and again as a teacher.

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:48.280
Teaching is really
humbling work when

00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:51.400
we realize that as much as
we want a student to grasp

00:03:51.400 --> 00:03:55.300
a concept or master a new skill,
their brains work and develop

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.220
at their own pace.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.616
Sometimes it takes one
explanation and they've got it.

00:03:59.616 --> 00:04:01.990
Sometimes we have to go over
it again and again and again

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.090
and model it and reteach
it and think of a new way

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:05.631
and think of a really
clever analogy,

00:04:05.631 --> 00:04:08.330
and then maybe they'll get it.

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:10.900
There's no one right way
to get to that end point.

00:04:10.900 --> 00:04:13.480
And more often than not, we're
going to mess up a few times

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:14.960
before we get there.

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:17.170
But if we can remember
van Gogh's doggedness

00:04:17.170 --> 00:04:20.870
in his own journey, I think
there are lessons for us there.

00:04:20.870 --> 00:04:24.990
So he also wrote to Theo, "Even
if one loses here and there,

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.220
and even if one sometimes
feels a sort of decline,

00:04:28.220 --> 00:04:31.400
the point is nevertheless
to revive and have courage,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:34.505
even though things don't turn
out as one first thought."

00:04:34.505 --> 00:04:37.840
And I feel like that perfectly
sums up our work sometimes.

00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.450
So often, just like
van Gogh explained,

00:04:40.450 --> 00:04:43.150
things don't turn out
exactly the way we planned,

00:04:43.150 --> 00:04:46.510
but we persist because we
know that all of our students

00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:50.150
deserve opportunities
to learn and grow.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:53.060
To me, one of the most beautiful
things about being an educator

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.260
is that every single day, we
are surrounded by amazing people

00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.060
and their amazing minds.

00:04:59.060 --> 00:05:02.660
And we walk among this
constant source of inspiration

00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.560
in our work.

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.050
We're surrounded by
colleagues, by peers

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:09.590
and by students who are
incredible, brilliant people.

00:05:09.590 --> 00:05:13.280
And they remind us that
even though the work is hard

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.150
and the work sometimes
feels impossible,

00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:17.030
we have to be relentless.

00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:20.300
We have to believe that we as
individuals can make a huge

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:23.192
impact on our students
and by extension--

00:05:23.192 --> 00:05:25.400
and this was said a little
while ago and I loved it--

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.090
the world.

00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:29.545
We can change the world
through our actions.

00:05:29.545 --> 00:05:30.920
During my first
year of teaching,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.294
there was this
10th grade student

00:05:32.294 --> 00:05:35.930
named Sheron who reminded me
of the power one individual

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:37.910
can have.

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:40.430
At that time my
school's uniform policy

00:05:40.430 --> 00:05:44.000
required that all students had
to wear black or khaki pants.

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.840
Students who showed up to school
in jeans or shorts or skirts

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.410
had to change in order to be
allowed to come into class.

00:05:51.410 --> 00:05:54.890
So 10th grade Sheron was a
force to be reckoned with.

00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:55.790
She was super smart.

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.020
She was outspoken.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:05:59.379
She had incredible
leadership skills.

00:05:59.379 --> 00:06:01.670
And all throughout the previous
year as a ninth grader,

00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:03.260
she'd shown up to
school every day

00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:04.760
wearing black or khaki pants--

00:06:04.760 --> 00:06:06.470
following the uniform policy.

00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:08.870
But that September when she
turned into a 10th grader,

00:06:08.870 --> 00:06:11.600
she showed up and she was
wearing a floor length khaki

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.620
skirt.

00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:17.070
She told her teachers that
her religion required women

00:06:17.070 --> 00:06:19.080
to wear skirts, not pants.

00:06:19.080 --> 00:06:21.690
And that she was tired of
breaking with her faith

00:06:21.690 --> 00:06:24.030
to follow the school's rule.

00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:26.610
She liked the school, she said.

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:29.250
She just didn't
want to wear pants.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:32.340
So her teachers consulted
with school administrators

00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.320
and told her that,
unfortunately, she was not

00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.980
permitted to be in pants--

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.860
whoops, no, she
was not permitted

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.680
to be in class unless
she was in uniform,

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.690
unless she was wearing pants.

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:45.960
So that day, she sat
outside in the hallway

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:47.220
and did all of her work.

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:49.920
She stayed the whole
day wearing her skirt,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:53.340
doing her work out of uniform.

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.910
The next day, she showed up
again in another floor length

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.480
khaki skirt.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:59.010
Again, she was told to change.

00:06:59.010 --> 00:07:02.410
She refused and she did
her work in the hallway.

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.450
The administrators who
made the call saw this

00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:05.910
as a really simple issue--

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:08.260
uniform policy called for pants.

00:07:08.260 --> 00:07:10.060
Sheron was not
following that policy.

00:07:10.060 --> 00:07:12.010
Case closed.

00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:13.510
But the situation
didn't sit right

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:15.010
with a lot of other people.

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.680
Having an eager student
sitting in the hallway all day

00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:19.420
just because she
was wearing a skirt,

00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:21.086
especially because
it was out of a sense

00:07:21.086 --> 00:07:24.220
of religious obligation,
felt contrary to our values

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:25.450
as an institution.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:28.640
It felt like it went against
the reasons we worked with kids.

00:07:28.640 --> 00:07:29.890
The reasons we were educators.

00:07:29.890 --> 00:07:31.210
We wanted to value
who they were.

00:07:31.210 --> 00:07:32.960
We wanted to show them
that they mattered.

00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.500
And instead, we had her
sitting in the hall.

00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.480
And the students weren't
happy about it either.

00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:38.327
They called us out.

00:07:38.327 --> 00:07:39.660
They told us we were hypocrites.

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:40.810
You know how they do.

00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:45.040
They threatened that they would
show up in solidarity skirts.

00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:46.780
They would call our bluff.

00:07:46.780 --> 00:07:49.420
You can't keep us all
out of class, they said.

00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.040
It's not fair, they said.

00:07:51.040 --> 00:07:53.810
The rule is stupid, they said.

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.620
And over lunch and after
classes, a lot of us

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.690
thought that they
might be right.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:00.700
They might have a point.

00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:02.860
At our school, we pride
ourselves on our approach

00:08:02.860 --> 00:08:04.150
to teaching history.

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.790
We use an interdisciplinary
humanities model

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.880
to weave stories from history
together with literacy skills,

00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.495
and we center our curricula
on the idea of social justice.

00:08:13.495 --> 00:08:15.370
During her ninth grade
year, the year before,

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.189
Sheron had studied the history
of apartheid in South Africa.

00:08:18.189 --> 00:08:20.230
And she and her classmates
had looked at the ways

00:08:20.230 --> 00:08:23.470
that South Africans
had resisted apartheid.

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:25.720
She knew about
civil disobedience--

00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.720
the idea that protesting
an unjust rule

00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:31.420
by peacefully breaking it and
accepting the consequences

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:33.039
could create change.

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:35.430
And she knew about that
because teachers at our school

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.429
had taught her about it.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:42.559
So day after day, Sheron
showed up in a skirt,

00:08:42.559 --> 00:08:45.390
embodying the principles
of civil disobedience.

00:08:45.390 --> 00:08:47.450
And day after day, the
school punished her for it

00:08:47.450 --> 00:08:51.490
because we had tied ourselves
to a rigid rule in a handbook.

00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:54.980
Sheron and her friends began
circulating a petition calling

00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:57.500
for a religious
exemption to be written

00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.940
into the uniform policy.

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.340
They gathered the signature
of almost every single person

00:09:01.340 --> 00:09:04.860
in the school-- students and
staff and administrators.

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:08.220
And so one night, they packed
into a classroom-- students,

00:09:08.220 --> 00:09:11.120
staff, family members,
and Sheron in her skirt--

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.340
for the monthly
school board meeting,

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.320
which was usually
sparsely attended and not

00:09:15.320 --> 00:09:17.720
at all on students' radars.

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.890
At the meeting, Sheron presented
the petition and made her case.

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:25.362
The board members listened and
they approved the exemption.

00:09:25.362 --> 00:09:27.320
And looking back, it
makes sense that the board

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:28.970
voted to make the change.

00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:30.860
It was undeniably
the right change

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.900
to make to an unjust rule.

00:09:32.900 --> 00:09:34.970
So then why had it
taken all of the adults

00:09:34.970 --> 00:09:37.670
so long to come around?

00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:40.940
I think sometimes as adults,
we default to the logic

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:43.897
of our brains instead of
the logic of our hearts.

00:09:43.897 --> 00:09:45.980
And if there are any biology
teachers in the room,

00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:48.290
forgive me, because
you're probably

00:09:48.290 --> 00:09:50.930
cringing at this clearly
nonscientific exploration

00:09:50.930 --> 00:09:52.580
of anatomy, but I
started out as a poet

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.830
and sometimes I have to do
these things, so I'm sorry.

00:09:54.830 --> 00:09:57.740
So brain logic said that
the rule was the rule,

00:09:57.740 --> 00:09:59.622
and Sheron and her
family had signed papers

00:09:59.622 --> 00:10:00.830
agreeing to follow the rules.

00:10:00.830 --> 00:10:02.288
And so she had to
follow the rules,

00:10:02.288 --> 00:10:04.600
and that was the end
of it, case closed.

00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.222
Brain logic said if the rule
was bent for one student,

00:10:07.222 --> 00:10:09.430
it would have to be bent
for everyone and chaos would

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:10.910
ensue--

00:10:10.910 --> 00:10:12.960
whatever chaos looks
like when students

00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.370
choose their own
clothing, I don't know.

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:19.400
Brain logic said she had worn
pants the entire year previous,

00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:22.220
and so she should just
keep wearing them.

00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.500
But heart logic was
like, hey, guys--

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.236
because heart logic
is more casual.

00:10:26.236 --> 00:10:27.860
Heart logic was like,
hey, guys, here's

00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:29.770
a kid who really
wants to learn, who's

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.990
showing up to school every day
and completing her assignments.

00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:35.587
And we're holding her out of
class because of her clothing,

00:10:35.587 --> 00:10:37.670
which she wears, by the
way, because of her faith.

00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.560
Heart logic said
this doesn't feel

00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:42.500
right even though
technically it might be OK.

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:45.080
Heart logic said rules
aren't as important as making

00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:49.370
sure this kid feels safe
and welcome here every day.

00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:52.796
Heart logic changes minds.

00:10:52.796 --> 00:10:54.170
For the past few
years, we've had

00:10:54.170 --> 00:10:58.880
students who wear skirts and
hijabs to school every day.

00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.620
And unbeknownst to
them, their ability

00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.560
to dress in accordance to their
religious beliefs at our school

00:11:03.560 --> 00:11:07.010
is due to Sheron, a
student they've never met.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:10.280
A student who's now an adult
and, just as a side note,

00:11:10.280 --> 00:11:12.770
is now an educator.

00:11:12.770 --> 00:11:15.260
Because of Sheron's insistence
that the school walk

00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:17.720
the walk of social justice,
that it live and breathe

00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:20.450
on our policies and not
just in our curricula,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:23.300
our handbook now contains rules
that are more just and more

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:25.450
responsive to our community.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:27.230
Because of Sheron,
other students

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:30.470
have since organized themselves
to successfully advocate

00:11:30.470 --> 00:11:33.800
for revising the uniform
policy over the last 10 years.

00:11:33.800 --> 00:11:36.140
Because of Sheron, we
now have conversations

00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:38.870
as a staff about whether
the policy still serves us

00:11:38.870 --> 00:11:43.160
as a school community or whether
it reflects our values at all.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.080
And all of those changes began
with one student's action.

00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.650
As van Gogh wrote, "The great
doesn't happen through impulse

00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.470
alone and is a succession
of little things

00:11:54.470 --> 00:11:56.270
that are brought together."

00:11:56.270 --> 00:12:00.740
One person can set those
little things into motion.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:04.070
As educators, we wholly
believe in our students' power

00:12:04.070 --> 00:12:05.900
and ability.

00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:07.772
We wouldn't do this
work if we didn't.

00:12:07.772 --> 00:12:10.270
We wouldn't be here in the
summer if we didn't, right?

00:12:10.270 --> 00:12:11.350
We care about it.

00:12:11.350 --> 00:12:12.350
We know that it matters.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:14.350
We know our students
are powerful.

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:16.930
But often when it comes
to believing in ourselves,

00:12:16.930 --> 00:12:19.690
in our own power and
ability as educators,

00:12:19.690 --> 00:12:22.900
we do not give ourselves the
same benefit of the doubt.

00:12:22.900 --> 00:12:25.930
We don't have confidence in
our own ability to make change.

00:12:25.930 --> 00:12:28.270
We think, I'm just one person.

00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:30.280
There isn't enough time.

00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:32.020
But imagine if we
re-conceptualized

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:33.940
what leadership looks like.

00:12:33.940 --> 00:12:37.210
Sometimes we have this mythical
image of the capital L, Leader,

00:12:37.210 --> 00:12:38.350
in our minds.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:40.100
They stand out in
front of everyone else.

00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:41.099
They have a fancy title.

00:12:41.099 --> 00:12:44.317
They have a business card, maybe
it's got color on one side.

00:12:44.317 --> 00:12:46.150
They've been in the
game a really long time.

00:12:46.150 --> 00:12:47.920
They know everything
there is to know.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.900
People trust them implicitly.

00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.610
They usher people
and organizations

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.940
through great changes
because they have vision.

00:12:54.940 --> 00:12:57.771
But in practice, great leaders
don't all look the same.

00:12:57.771 --> 00:12:59.020
They don't all look like that.

00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:00.000
We know that.

00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:01.060
There is no archetype.

00:13:01.060 --> 00:13:02.860
Some great leaders are
great collaborators.

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:03.980
They're excellent listeners.

00:13:03.980 --> 00:13:04.563
They delegate.

00:13:04.563 --> 00:13:05.989
They empower.

00:13:05.989 --> 00:13:08.530
One of the ideas that's always
stuck with me that I aspire to

00:13:08.530 --> 00:13:10.570
is that great leaders
make themselves obsolete.

00:13:10.570 --> 00:13:13.589
Great leaders create
other great leaders.

00:13:13.589 --> 00:13:15.130
That's one of the
reasons why I think

00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.255
it's so amazing that we
have principals here today,

00:13:17.255 --> 00:13:17.930
by the way.

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:19.466
So I want us to
rethink leadership

00:13:19.466 --> 00:13:21.340
as something that can
be held collaboratively

00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.750
by all of the
people in this room

00:13:22.750 --> 00:13:24.941
or by all the people
in the school.

00:13:24.941 --> 00:13:27.190
Calling ourselves leaders
doesn't mean that we have it

00:13:27.190 --> 00:13:28.160
all figured out.

00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.970
I call myself a teacher leader,
but I'm not a perfect teacher.

00:13:30.970 --> 00:13:33.100
If you walk into my classroom
any day of the week,

00:13:33.100 --> 00:13:35.350
you're going to see me
struggling with problems.

00:13:35.350 --> 00:13:37.308
You're going to see me
trying to figure out how

00:13:37.308 --> 00:13:38.590
to engage a reluctant reader.

00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:40.240
You're going to
see me figuring out

00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:41.680
how to support an
English language

00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:43.780
learner in literary
analysis, how

00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.940
to get a kid with
oppositional defiance disorder

00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:50.380
to stay in the classroom
and learn and feel valued.

00:13:50.380 --> 00:13:52.510
I make a lot of
mistakes, and I still

00:13:52.510 --> 00:13:54.340
battle self-doubt
that tells me I'm

00:13:54.340 --> 00:13:56.120
not worthy of that
title of leader,

00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.520
that I don't have anything
good to tell anybody else.

00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:02.050
But over the years,
I've started to expand

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:04.990
my definition of leadership
to include things

00:14:04.990 --> 00:14:07.780
like encouraging
vulnerability in others

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:11.920
by opening my own classroom
door and welcoming feedback.

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:14.650
To me, leadership can mean
collaborating with people

00:14:14.650 --> 00:14:18.520
who make me smarter
and more courageous,

00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:20.260
but who might not
have as many chances

00:14:20.260 --> 00:14:23.530
as I have to get out there
and have their voices heard.

00:14:23.530 --> 00:14:25.330
Leadership means
being the one to start

00:14:25.330 --> 00:14:28.630
an uncomfortable but necessary
conversation among the staff

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.920
about how we can do better.

00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:32.260
Leadership means
nurturing skills

00:14:32.260 --> 00:14:35.080
of leadership in other people,
including our students.

00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.750
Leadership means
believing, like Sheron did,

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:39.670
that even a small
action on our part

00:14:39.670 --> 00:14:43.486
might be the thing that
causes a big change.

00:14:43.486 --> 00:14:44.860
Educators need to
get comfortable

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.320
seeing ourselves as leaders.

00:14:47.320 --> 00:14:50.170
We can have influence far
beyond our individual classrooms

00:14:50.170 --> 00:14:52.150
if we remind ourselves
that we define

00:14:52.150 --> 00:14:55.450
what leadership looks like, and
that one person's actions can

00:14:55.450 --> 00:14:59.010
have wide reaching consequences.

00:14:59.010 --> 00:15:00.900
An aside-- when I
was a little kid,

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:02.792
I did a short-lived
stint as a ballerina.

00:15:02.792 --> 00:15:04.500
It only lasted a little
while, and then I

00:15:04.500 --> 00:15:07.470
quit because the teacher
wouldn't let me wear pink.

00:15:07.470 --> 00:15:09.020
No, no, she said I
had to wear pink.

00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.290
I couldn't wear purple
and blue, and I really

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:11.270
wanted to wear purple and blue.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:13.478
I wanted to be me, but she
wouldn't let me so I quit.

00:15:13.478 --> 00:15:15.520
But before I quit,
there was this recital.

00:15:15.520 --> 00:15:17.250
And because I was
tall, she put me

00:15:17.250 --> 00:15:18.880
in charge of leading
one of the groups.

00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:20.970
So what was going to happen
was that the two groups were

00:15:20.970 --> 00:15:22.261
going to come out of the wings.

00:15:22.261 --> 00:15:25.740
We're going to do this sort
of elegant ballet-like gallop.

00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:27.720
And I was going to lead
one group galloping,

00:15:27.720 --> 00:15:29.130
and this other girl was going
to lead this other group.

00:15:29.130 --> 00:15:29.970
We're going to gallop out.

00:15:29.970 --> 00:15:30.595
So here we are.

00:15:30.595 --> 00:15:33.090
It's the day of the recital,
and I'm wearing my pink.

00:15:33.090 --> 00:15:36.381
And I come galloping out
of the side very elegantly.

00:15:36.381 --> 00:15:38.380
I come galloping out,
leading my group of girls.

00:15:38.380 --> 00:15:40.290
And I get onstage, and I'm
supposed to lead them around

00:15:40.290 --> 00:15:40.800
in a circle.

00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:42.420
And then something else
is supposed to happen,

00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:43.544
but it just leaves my head.

00:15:43.544 --> 00:15:45.000
I go completely blank.

00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.534
And so I'm galloping
and galloping,

00:15:46.534 --> 00:15:47.700
and everyone's following me.

00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:49.610
And I catch the eye--

00:15:49.610 --> 00:15:50.516
but it looks good.

00:15:50.516 --> 00:15:51.390
It looks really good.

00:15:51.390 --> 00:15:55.860
I catch the eye of the girl
who was leading the other team.

00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:57.740
It's not what it's
supposed to be.

00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:59.490
And then I catch the
eye of the girl who's

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.830
leading the other team,
and I'm like, all right,

00:16:01.830 --> 00:16:03.450
I'm just going to
do what she does.

00:16:03.450 --> 00:16:06.619
So she leads her circle around,
so I lead my circle around.

00:16:06.619 --> 00:16:08.160
And then she leads
her circle around,

00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:09.326
and I lead my circle around.

00:16:09.326 --> 00:16:12.550
And we end up going around
and around and around

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.005
until the teacher comes out
galloping, not elegantly,

00:16:16.005 --> 00:16:17.380
and she sort of
stops everything.

00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.380
And she's like, hold on.

00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:19.940
And she apologizes
to the audience,

00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:20.950
which is like the
worst thing ever

00:16:20.950 --> 00:16:23.283
if you're performing to have
someone be like, I'm sorry.

00:16:23.283 --> 00:16:26.620
And she huddles us up and
she says, what happened?

00:16:26.620 --> 00:16:28.840
And I looked at her and
I was like, I forgot.

00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:30.750
So I was following her.

00:16:30.750 --> 00:16:34.120
And the other girl was like,
well, I was following you.

00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:37.160
And so I say that
to say, if we aren't

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:38.950
going to be the ones
to step up and be

00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:40.900
the leaders in our
schools, then who is?

00:16:40.900 --> 00:16:41.960
We're just going
to be following.

00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:43.810
We're going in circles
around and around and around.

00:16:43.810 --> 00:16:46.090
And so at some point, we've got
to sort of step up and be like,

00:16:46.090 --> 00:16:48.000
all right, I'm going to
gallop this thing off

00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.250
in some sort of direction to at
least get us going somewhere.

00:16:52.250 --> 00:16:54.400
We all need to see
ourselves as leaders.

00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:56.470
We all need to be
brave in the face

00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.390
of seeming impossibilities.

00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:00.160
And in order to do
that, we need to work

00:17:00.160 --> 00:17:03.670
within school communities that
encourage collaboration that

00:17:03.670 --> 00:17:05.859
say it's OK to take
risks, that we're going

00:17:05.859 --> 00:17:07.839
to learn from our mistakes.

00:17:07.839 --> 00:17:11.420
We need to have the freedom
and the support to innovate.

00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:14.530
We need to listen to brain
logic and heart logic.

00:17:14.530 --> 00:17:17.900
And when all teachers are able
to see ourselves as leaders,

00:17:17.900 --> 00:17:20.530
as members of a powerful
collective of people who

00:17:20.530 --> 00:17:22.510
care about doing
the best work we can

00:17:22.510 --> 00:17:24.490
on behalf of our
students, we take

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.040
risks that have big payoffs.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.870
We try new techniques.

00:17:28.870 --> 00:17:31.840
We partner with people
we otherwise wouldn't.

00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:33.970
We feel a sense of
personal responsibility

00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:35.890
for what happens in our schools.

00:17:35.890 --> 00:17:38.440
And we are relentless in
advocating for the changes

00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:39.850
our students need.

00:17:39.850 --> 00:17:42.160
We don't allow
fumbles or missteps

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:44.320
to deter us from
our ultimate mission

00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:48.010
of getting every student
in our schools to succeed.

00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:49.510
We shift the cultures
of our schools

00:17:49.510 --> 00:17:52.570
away from closed doors
and hidden struggles

00:17:52.570 --> 00:17:55.570
towards collaboration
and honesty.

00:17:55.570 --> 00:17:59.580
We remember that
change takes time.

00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:05.010
In October 1883, van Gogh wrote
his brother Theo a long letter.

00:18:05.010 --> 00:18:08.040
The letter implies that Theo was
having doubts about his career.

00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:10.500
Theo was an art dealer, but
he was getting frustrated.

00:18:10.500 --> 00:18:12.360
And he wondered if
maybe he should just

00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:14.030
go into the business
of art itself--

00:18:14.030 --> 00:18:15.870
if he should try his
hand at being an artist

00:18:15.870 --> 00:18:18.120
like his brother, but he
had doubts about whether he

00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:19.506
was cut out for it.

00:18:19.506 --> 00:18:20.880
So van Gogh gave
him what I think

00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.720
is some of the most beautiful
advice ever written.

00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:27.360
He says, "If you hear a
voice within you saying,

00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:32.280
you are not a painter, then
by all means paint, boy,

00:18:32.280 --> 00:18:36.900
and that voice will be
silenced, but only by working."

00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.170
This year, you have the
opportunity to be painters.

00:18:40.170 --> 00:18:43.290
You have the opportunity to
be leaders within your schools

00:18:43.290 --> 00:18:48.310
and effect changes that reach
beyond just one classroom.

00:18:48.310 --> 00:18:50.940
So what kind of schools
can you envision?

00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:54.480
What kind of masterpieces
might you create?

00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:58.040
There are incredible things
happening in our schools,

00:18:58.040 --> 00:19:00.930
and there is so much
more on the horizon.

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.800
Our students, our Sherons,
and all the other ones--

00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.910
they're brave.

00:19:05.910 --> 00:19:08.160
And when they discover
their leadership potential,

00:19:08.160 --> 00:19:10.590
they can change the world.

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:13.680
We need to learn that
bravery from them.

00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.280
Inspired by our students
and for our students,

00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:19.150
we have to be leaders.

00:19:19.150 --> 00:19:23.008
And by all means,
we have to paint.

00:19:23.008 --> 00:19:23.996
Thank you.

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:27.454
[APPLAUSE]

00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:37.039
So I'm a teacher, and I'm going
to ask you to do some writing

00:19:37.039 --> 00:19:38.080
and thinking and talking.

00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:40.746
And then you're going to talk to
me, and it's going to be great.

00:19:40.746 --> 00:19:42.910
So I'm going to
ask you on your own

00:19:42.910 --> 00:19:45.542
to write or think about
these two questions--

00:19:45.542 --> 00:19:48.000
what beautiful things do you
want to create at your school?

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.561
So van Gogh said he longed so
much to make beautiful things,

00:19:52.561 --> 00:19:54.310
but he knew that
beautiful things required

00:19:54.310 --> 00:19:55.760
effort and determination.

00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.930
So what beautiful things do you
want to create at your school,

00:19:58.930 --> 00:20:01.330
and what stands in your way?

00:20:01.330 --> 00:20:03.130
And you already did
the [INAUDIBLE]..

00:20:03.130 --> 00:20:06.030
So try to spend more time on
the first half than the second.

00:20:06.030 --> 00:20:08.280
We're just going to take two
minutes for you to write,

00:20:08.280 --> 00:20:11.090
and then I'm going
to ask you to talk.

00:20:11.090 --> 00:20:14.670
So I know that you're
sitting with your principal.

00:20:14.670 --> 00:20:16.445
So pair up with
not your principal.

00:20:16.445 --> 00:20:18.486
It could be somebody else
at your table, somebody

00:20:18.486 --> 00:20:19.130
else nearby.

00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.540
Pair up and I'm
going to give you

00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:22.990
three minutes just to share
with one another what you wrote.

00:20:22.990 --> 00:20:25.115
I'll tell you when a minute
and a half has gone by.

00:20:25.115 --> 00:20:28.203
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:20:47.690 --> 00:20:49.717
OK, so before we move
on to the next step,

00:20:49.717 --> 00:20:51.800
I would love to hear some
of the beautiful things.

00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:53.900
So what are a couple
of the beautiful things

00:20:53.900 --> 00:20:56.540
that you envision
happening at your school?

00:20:59.498 --> 00:21:01.470
AUDIENCE: I'd like to
see parent involvement

00:21:01.470 --> 00:21:03.688
in our middle school,
because we do not

00:21:03.688 --> 00:21:07.386
have PTA or PTO or any
parent organization.

00:21:07.386 --> 00:21:11.823
I would like to see that evolve
through this mission somehow.

00:21:11.823 --> 00:21:13.240
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Nice.

00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:16.130
Anyone agree with
that, poetry snobs?

00:21:16.130 --> 00:21:18.260
All right, who else?

00:21:18.260 --> 00:21:21.140
Beautiful things?

00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:25.100
AUDIENCE: I'd like to create
an environment for teachers

00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:29.157
to be risk takers-- for them
to be comfortable doing that.

00:21:29.157 --> 00:21:31.490
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: She wants to
create an environment where

00:21:31.490 --> 00:21:33.445
teachers can be
risk takers, where

00:21:33.445 --> 00:21:34.820
there's an
environment where they

00:21:34.820 --> 00:21:37.040
feel comfortable doing that.

00:21:37.040 --> 00:21:39.356
Awesome.

00:21:39.356 --> 00:21:43.670
AUDIENCE: Teachers who bring
joy to their classrooms.

00:21:43.670 --> 00:21:46.670
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Teachers who
bring joy to their classrooms.

00:21:46.670 --> 00:21:49.572
Can I hear two more?

00:21:49.572 --> 00:21:52.440
AUDIENCE: Teachers who want
to make their jobs easier

00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:54.352
by facilitating the
students' learning

00:21:54.352 --> 00:21:56.742
rather than telling the
student what they should learn.

00:21:56.742 --> 00:21:58.283
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Ah,
teachers who want

00:21:58.283 --> 00:22:01.460
to make their jobs easier by
facilitating students' learning

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:04.700
rather than telling
students what to learn.

00:22:04.700 --> 00:22:06.028
And right there.

00:22:06.028 --> 00:22:07.444
AUDIENCE: Thinking
about something

00:22:07.444 --> 00:22:09.200
that was on yours--
students who take

00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.472
charge of their own learning.

00:22:10.472 --> 00:22:11.930
SYDNEY CHAFFEE:
Beautiful, students

00:22:11.930 --> 00:22:13.790
who take charge of
their own learning.

00:22:13.790 --> 00:22:17.090
All right, so we've
already looked

00:22:17.090 --> 00:22:20.430
at this today, the sort
of concentric circle idea.

00:22:20.430 --> 00:22:23.240
And mine is less pretty
than the Google Slides,

00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.680
but I'm working on it.

00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:28.100
But I want you to think about
how you might re-envision

00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:30.740
your own leadership to make
some of those beautiful things

00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.430
possible, right.

00:22:31.430 --> 00:22:34.340
So we talked about the ripple
effect earlier with you

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:36.560
in the center, and
then moving out

00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:38.720
from you are sort of
these concentric circles

00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.970
of influence, right.

00:22:39.970 --> 00:22:42.410
Or these concentric
circles of, well,

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:44.180
who can you
immediately influence?

00:22:44.180 --> 00:22:45.440
Who might they influence?

00:22:45.440 --> 00:22:47.106
How might that spread
from there, right?

00:22:47.106 --> 00:22:50.420
The one we looked at earlier
said, self, school, world,

00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:51.530
I believe.

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:53.870
So you can work on this
individually or with the person

00:22:53.870 --> 00:22:55.460
you were just talking
to, but I want

00:22:55.460 --> 00:22:58.640
you to think a bit about, OK, if
that's the beautiful thing you

00:22:58.640 --> 00:23:02.060
want to create, how might
you be able to re-envision

00:23:02.060 --> 00:23:04.050
your own leadership
to make that happen?

00:23:04.050 --> 00:23:06.620
Who do you immediately
have influence

00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.260
on, or who do you immediately
have sort of an effect on,

00:23:09.260 --> 00:23:11.930
or what realm in your school
do you have an effect on?

00:23:11.930 --> 00:23:13.640
And then how does it
move out from there?

00:23:13.640 --> 00:23:15.740
How far could your
influence reach, OK?

00:23:15.740 --> 00:23:17.697
So you don't have to
have all the answers,

00:23:17.697 --> 00:23:19.280
but I want you to
just think about it.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:21.250
We're going to do five
minutes to think on this.

00:23:21.250 --> 00:23:23.833
So again, either alone or with
the person you were talking to.

00:23:23.833 --> 00:23:27.005
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:23:58.450 --> 00:23:58.950
OK.

00:23:58.950 --> 00:24:01.440
So at my school, every
year, we take our kids

00:24:01.440 --> 00:24:04.620
to this camp in New Hampshire
called Camp Merrowvista.

00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:06.390
And my kids are city
kids so they really

00:24:06.390 --> 00:24:07.600
think they're roughing it.

00:24:07.600 --> 00:24:10.610
But there are cabins, and
they're heated and whatever.

00:24:10.610 --> 00:24:12.360
But one of the things
we do at Merrowvista

00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:14.641
is they get into
this place where

00:24:14.641 --> 00:24:16.140
they feel like they
can do anything,

00:24:16.140 --> 00:24:17.640
and they're in this
really good headspace,

00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.556
and they're looking
forward to the year ahead.

00:24:19.556 --> 00:24:23.140
And so we ask them to set
intentions for the year.

00:24:23.140 --> 00:24:25.200
So we ask them to
think about, OK,

00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:27.337
if you are going to be this
person that you're here

00:24:27.337 --> 00:24:28.920
at Camp Merrowvista,
if you were going

00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:31.378
to be this person for the rest
of the year, what would that

00:24:31.378 --> 00:24:32.380
look like?

00:24:32.380 --> 00:24:36.030
And so earlier, we looked at
an analogy of a road trip.

00:24:36.030 --> 00:24:38.040
And we talked about
what's more important

00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:41.280
than the vehicle is the goal.

00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.865
So I actually want to think
about this intention as like--

00:24:44.865 --> 00:24:46.740
I was sitting back there
trying to figure out

00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:48.570
what the appropriate thing
in the analogy would be.

00:24:48.570 --> 00:24:50.910
And it was a long flight,
and I don't really know.

00:24:50.910 --> 00:24:53.010
But what I came
up with was that I

00:24:53.010 --> 00:24:55.290
want you to think about
your intention as the snacks

00:24:55.290 --> 00:24:57.750
and the music that you
need in order to make

00:24:57.750 --> 00:24:59.160
the trip in the first place.

00:24:59.160 --> 00:25:01.330
So your intention
is not your goal.

00:25:01.330 --> 00:25:03.120
It's not something
that you can check off

00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:05.550
at the end of the year and
be like, yes, I did it.

00:25:05.550 --> 00:25:08.610
Your intention is the way that
you're going to be this year.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:10.110
So if we're thinking
about, OK, you

00:25:10.110 --> 00:25:12.000
want to create these
beautiful things that you just

00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.470
talked about, you
want to re-envision

00:25:13.470 --> 00:25:15.678
your own leadership, you
want to think about yourself

00:25:15.678 --> 00:25:17.970
as the middle of
that ripple effect.

00:25:17.970 --> 00:25:20.010
What is the way
that you have to be?

00:25:20.010 --> 00:25:22.800
What is the way that you have
to live or exist in your school

00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:25.630
or as a leader in order
to make that possible?

00:25:25.630 --> 00:25:28.565
And so I want you
to think about that.

00:25:28.565 --> 00:25:30.690
And we always have our kids
start it out by saying,

00:25:30.690 --> 00:25:34.920
this year my intention is,
and it's like one sentence.

00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:37.400
So again, it's not
a goal, but how

00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.670
do you want to be this year.

00:25:39.670 --> 00:25:42.580
It's something that you can keep
coming back to again and again,

00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:43.830
even when you mess up--

00:25:43.830 --> 00:25:45.810
because you will,
because we all do--

00:25:45.810 --> 00:25:47.670
to remind yourself,
oh, yeah, this

00:25:47.670 --> 00:25:49.800
is how I wanted to
be this year to make

00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:50.890
beautiful things happen.

00:25:50.890 --> 00:25:52.348
So take a couple
of minutes and try

00:25:52.348 --> 00:25:56.320
to articulate an intention that
you might have for this year.

00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:59.764
And then we'll have some
time to share them out.

00:25:59.764 --> 00:26:04.228
[SIDE CONVERSATION]

00:26:19.620 --> 00:26:23.450
All right, so I'd
like to hear these.

00:26:23.450 --> 00:26:27.110
I'd like for you to use your
teacher voices, all right.

00:26:27.110 --> 00:26:30.019
So I'd like to hear a bunch
of them if you could stand up.

00:26:30.019 --> 00:26:32.060
Tell us your name because
I don't know your name.

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:33.950
And tell us your
intention for the year.

00:26:37.184 --> 00:26:39.960
AUDIENCE: Hi, my
name is [INAUDIBLE]..

00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:44.030
And this year, my
intention is to be

00:26:44.030 --> 00:26:48.476
to be a valuable asset
to all staff members.

00:26:48.476 --> 00:26:51.440
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: I like that.

00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.404
AUDIENCE: Hi, I'm
Stephanie, and my intention

00:26:54.404 --> 00:26:57.390
is to have a growth
mindset with myself.

00:26:57.390 --> 00:26:59.554
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Nice.

00:26:59.554 --> 00:27:02.750
AUDIENCE: My name's
[INAUDIBLE],, and this year, I

00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:05.119
want to be an assertive
leader to the staff,

00:27:05.119 --> 00:27:09.111
being apathetic,
genuine, just serve them

00:27:09.111 --> 00:27:11.356
where they don't feel
like I'm on top of them,

00:27:11.356 --> 00:27:12.609
that I'm underneath them.

00:27:12.609 --> 00:27:13.650
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Ah, nice.

00:27:20.139 --> 00:27:22.014
AUDIENCE: My intention
as part of the program

00:27:22.014 --> 00:27:23.982
is to be a listener
and a connector,

00:27:23.982 --> 00:27:26.442
to really hear what's going
on with people-- what's

00:27:26.442 --> 00:27:28.902
going well, what challenges
there are, and help people

00:27:28.902 --> 00:27:32.455
create [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:32.455 --> 00:27:33.330
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Nice.

00:27:39.750 --> 00:27:44.984
I would like to hear
three more and I'll wait.

00:27:44.984 --> 00:27:46.968
AUDIENCE: My name
is Darlene Jackson

00:27:46.968 --> 00:27:50.482
and this year my intention
is to empower teachers.

00:27:50.482 --> 00:27:51.440
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Mm-hmm.

00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:53.100
Short and sweet--
empower teachers.

00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:55.510
I like that.

00:27:55.510 --> 00:27:57.470
AUDIENCE: My intention--
my name's Mike.

00:27:57.470 --> 00:28:00.900
My intention is to create
opportunities for the students

00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:02.184
to empower themselves.

00:28:02.184 --> 00:28:03.350
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: I love that.

00:28:06.290 --> 00:28:09.475
AUDIENCE: I am April, and
this year my intention

00:28:09.475 --> 00:28:12.415
is stay focused and committed
to the process regardless

00:28:12.415 --> 00:28:13.589
of obstacles.

00:28:13.589 --> 00:28:15.880
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Nice, did
you guys hear that over here?

00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:18.400
Stay focused and committed
to the process regardless

00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.170
of obstacles.

00:28:20.170 --> 00:28:22.659
Nice, I know I had
one in the back.

00:28:22.659 --> 00:28:24.492
AUDIENCE: I thought you
wanted us to come up

00:28:24.492 --> 00:28:26.690
with a journey and a snack.

00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:31.181
In my mind, I thought of
margaritas and Doritos.

00:28:31.181 --> 00:28:34.674
[LAUGHING]

00:28:40.662 --> 00:28:46.067
Margaritas and Doritos to
spice it up in our school.

00:28:46.067 --> 00:28:47.400
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: No, I like that.

00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:48.880
I like that.

00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:50.750
She made it her own.

00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.110
Margaritas on a road
trip, I don't know.

00:28:53.110 --> 00:28:55.102
All right, anyone else?

00:28:55.102 --> 00:28:56.310
My principal does this thing.

00:28:56.310 --> 00:28:57.340
Principals don't do this thing.

00:28:57.340 --> 00:28:58.660
My principal does this
thing where it will

00:28:58.660 --> 00:28:59.950
be in a full staff meeting--

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.290
I love my principal, so
I can make fun of him--

00:29:02.290 --> 00:29:05.590
and then he'll be like,
OK, any last burnings?

00:29:05.590 --> 00:29:07.267
And then no one else
ever says anything,

00:29:07.267 --> 00:29:09.850
because you don't want to be the
one who has the last burning.

00:29:09.850 --> 00:29:13.320
So any last burnings?

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.370
No?

00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.620
OK, well that's all
I have for you today.

00:29:17.620 --> 00:29:19.760
If you are
interested, I'm trying

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.750
to up my social media game,
because my students told me

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:23.820
I had to.

00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:26.110
The top one is Twitter, the
bottom one is Instagram.

00:29:26.110 --> 00:29:29.140
I made the Instagram so my
kids could follow my journey,

00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:30.790
because they told
me to join Snapchat

00:29:30.790 --> 00:29:32.140
and I said I'm too old for that.

00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.010
So anyway that's me if
you want to follow me.

00:29:35.010 --> 00:29:36.550
And then I have a
few minutes left

00:29:36.550 --> 00:29:39.400
if there's anyone who has any
questions about space camp

00:29:39.400 --> 00:29:41.710
or me or anything else.

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:46.130
Yes?

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:48.190
AUDIENCE: Where are
you going for that?

00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:50.190
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Where am
I going for space camp?

00:29:50.190 --> 00:29:53.610
To the moon-- no, we're
going to Huntsville, Alabama.

00:29:53.610 --> 00:29:54.524
[CHEERING]

00:29:54.524 --> 00:30:01.220
Oh, hey, OK, I need
to talk to you guys.

00:30:01.220 --> 00:30:04.600
OK, I need to
connect with you guys

00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:07.000
later, because all of the
state teachers of the year

00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:08.560
will be there next
week or tomorrow,

00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.060
and we're looking
for a karaoke bar.

00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:13.210
So get back to us.

00:30:13.210 --> 00:30:14.450
Any other questions?

00:30:17.640 --> 00:30:18.140
Yes?

00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.250
AUDIENCE: What teacher had
an impact on your life?

00:30:20.250 --> 00:30:21.650
SYDNEY CHAFFEE: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:30:21.650 --> 00:30:23.310
What teacher had an
impact on my life.

00:30:23.310 --> 00:30:26.540
So the first teacher that had
an impact on my life was my mom.

00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:29.390
My mom went back to
college on the day

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:30.960
that I started kindergarten.

00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.830
So she put me in the
car, drove me to school,

00:30:33.830 --> 00:30:35.630
and went back to get her degree.

00:30:35.630 --> 00:30:39.050
And so growing up,
she was a feminist.

00:30:39.050 --> 00:30:41.510
She was a working mom,
and she was a student.

00:30:41.510 --> 00:30:43.860
And eventually when
she got her degree,

00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:45.830
then she got her
masters, she went back

00:30:45.830 --> 00:30:47.220
and she was an
adjunct professor.

00:30:47.220 --> 00:30:50.930
And so growing up, I had this
strong woman in my house,

00:30:50.930 --> 00:30:53.952
and the message that I got
was that that was good,

00:30:53.952 --> 00:30:55.910
and that that was normal,
and that was natural,

00:30:55.910 --> 00:30:57.590
and that education
was really important.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:31:00.290
And it was worth juggling
all of these things

00:31:00.290 --> 00:31:02.870
to have that education.

00:31:02.870 --> 00:31:05.254
And that there's no one path.

00:31:05.254 --> 00:31:07.670
There are lots of different
ways to get where we're going.

00:31:07.670 --> 00:31:11.330
So she was my first,
most important teacher.

00:31:11.330 --> 00:31:13.790
In college, I had a
teacher named Lyde Sizer.

00:31:13.790 --> 00:31:16.280
I went to Sarah
Lawrence, and Lyde Sizer

00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.320
is the daughter of Ted Sizer--

00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:20.655
famous ed reformer who
started the coalition

00:31:20.655 --> 00:31:21.530
of essential schools.

00:31:21.530 --> 00:31:23.780
He wrote this book
"Horace's Compromise."

00:31:23.780 --> 00:31:26.960
And I decided in college,
I'm going to be a professor.

00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:28.910
So I had gone to
college to be a poet.

00:31:28.910 --> 00:31:31.310
And then my poetry teacher
told me that I probably

00:31:31.310 --> 00:31:32.450
shouldn't be a poet.

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:33.486
And I guess--

00:31:33.486 --> 00:31:34.860
[LAUGHTER]

00:31:34.860 --> 00:31:37.760
I guess he's like, I
don't know, an expert

00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:41.110
because he got a Pulitzer
for poetry the other year.

00:31:41.110 --> 00:31:43.016
So I was like, OK,
what am I going to do?

00:31:43.016 --> 00:31:44.140
I'm not going to be a poet.

00:31:44.140 --> 00:31:46.480
And so I was studying women's
history with Lyde Sizer.

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:48.420
And I was studying
writing, but not poetry.

00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:49.210
And I was trying
to figure out what

00:31:49.210 --> 00:31:50.180
I was going to do with my life.

00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:51.280
And then I had this epiphany.

00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:52.810
And I was like, I'm
going to be a professor.

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:55.000
I'm going to be a professor
at Sarah Lawrence.

00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.700
I'm going to stay here forever,
because I love it here.

00:31:57.700 --> 00:31:59.890
And I'll do for people
what you've done

00:31:59.890 --> 00:32:01.190
for me-- it was very beautiful.

00:32:01.190 --> 00:32:02.830
So I go into her office
and I'm like, that's what

00:32:02.830 --> 00:32:03.496
I'm going to do.

00:32:03.496 --> 00:32:06.269
And she was like, OK, calm down.

00:32:06.269 --> 00:32:07.810
You know, you're
20, you're not going

00:32:07.810 --> 00:32:09.820
to be a professor next year.

00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:12.850
And she sent me off to her
father's school in the Bronx--

00:32:12.850 --> 00:32:14.320
coalition school.

00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:17.057
And it was my first
experience, not as

00:32:17.057 --> 00:32:19.390
a high school student myself,
being in a classroom again

00:32:19.390 --> 00:32:21.556
and watching what was
happening and having that sort

00:32:21.556 --> 00:32:24.250
of outsider perspective.

00:32:24.250 --> 00:32:26.860
And I decided that I wanted
to teach younger people

00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:28.840
and maybe not be a professor.

00:32:28.840 --> 00:32:30.749
And then I went to
SummerBridge, which

00:32:30.749 --> 00:32:33.040
is now called Breakthrough
Collaborative, for a summer.

00:32:33.040 --> 00:32:34.748
And then I did Citizen
Schools in Boston,

00:32:34.748 --> 00:32:36.970
and then I ended up
at my current school.

00:32:36.970 --> 00:32:40.166
But she really set me on
that path of saying, OK,

00:32:40.166 --> 00:32:41.290
there are models out there.

00:32:41.290 --> 00:32:43.360
Let me show you.

00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:44.350
And she influenced me.

00:32:44.350 --> 00:32:46.590
Also, just because I
wanted to be here because

00:32:46.590 --> 00:32:47.590
she was a great teacher.

00:32:47.590 --> 00:32:50.800
She made me think,
and I always wanted

00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:53.675
her to believe in my ideas.

00:32:53.675 --> 00:32:55.300
And I knew she did
believe in my ideas,

00:32:55.300 --> 00:32:56.966
but she also was the
type of teacher who

00:32:56.966 --> 00:32:58.780
would just push me and
push me to say, OK,

00:32:58.780 --> 00:33:00.280
but what about this?

00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:01.489
OK, let's dig deeper on that.

00:33:01.489 --> 00:33:03.030
And she asked really
great questions.

00:33:03.030 --> 00:33:03.840
She made me think.

00:33:07.494 --> 00:33:11.430
Any questions?

00:33:11.430 --> 00:33:13.760
SPEAKER 1: All right,
well if that's the end,

00:33:13.760 --> 00:33:16.130
we want to thank Sydney again.

00:33:16.130 --> 00:33:17.630
Thank you so much
for being here.

00:33:17.630 --> 00:33:20.980
