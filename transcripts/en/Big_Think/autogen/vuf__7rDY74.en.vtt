entry barriers like crazy and then you
 

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.870
entry barriers like crazy and then you
defended that position against

defended that position against
 

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.390
defended that position against
competition and as I've worked with

00:00:23.390 --> 00:00:23.400
competition and as I've worked with
 

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:25.310
competition and as I've worked with
companies as I've worked around the

world what became pretty clear was that

world what became pretty clear was that
 

00:00:27.539 --> 00:00:29.179

traditional view of strategy was not
 

00:00:29.189 --> 00:00:31.970
traditional view of strategy was not
only not really well reflected in what

00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:31.980
only not really well reflected in what
 

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.500
only not really well reflected in what
was going on but that it was actually

was going on but that it was actually
 

00:00:33.510 --> 00:00:36.080
was going on but that it was actually
dangerous that it causes companies to do

dangerous that it causes companies to do
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:37.790

a lot of stupid things like focus
 

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.530
a lot of stupid things like focus
excessively on your competition rather

excessively on your competition rather
 

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.139

arenas in which you're competing and
 

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.400
arenas in which you're competing and
most dangerous of all focus on stability

00:00:49.400 --> 00:00:49.410
most dangerous of all focus on stability

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:50.940
when what you need to really be thinking
 

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.389
when what you need to really be thinking
about is change and dynamism so the book

00:00:53.389 --> 00:00:53.399
about is change and dynamism so the book

the end of competitive advantage was

00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:55.020
the end of competitive advantage was
 

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.290
the end of competitive advantage was
really meant to begin a conversation

00:00:57.290 --> 00:00:57.300
really meant to begin a conversation
 

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.180
really meant to begin a conversation
about what strategy looks like today for

00:00:59.180 --> 00:00:59.190
about what strategy looks like today for
 

00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.360
about what strategy looks like today for
more and more of our companies well I

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
more and more of our companies well I
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.619
more and more of our companies well I
think the idea of sustainable

00:01:03.619 --> 00:01:03.629
think the idea of sustainable
 

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:05.090
think the idea of sustainable
competitive advantage really got

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:05.100
competitive advantage really got
 

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:08.300
competitive advantage really got
entrenched in the strategy lexicon in

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:08.310
entrenched in the strategy lexicon in
 

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.000
entrenched in the strategy lexicon in
the 1960s and 70s in the u.s. primarily

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:11.010
the 1960s and 70s in the u.s. primarily
 

00:01:11.010 --> 00:01:13.190
the 1960s and 70s in the u.s. primarily
and if you think about those times if

00:01:13.190 --> 00:01:13.200
and if you think about those times if
 

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.690
and if you think about those times if
you go back in time to when those

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:14.700
you go back in time to when those
 

00:01:14.700 --> 00:01:16.789
you go back in time to when those
concepts were first developed you know

00:01:16.789 --> 00:01:16.799
concepts were first developed you know
 

00:01:16.799 --> 00:01:17.929
concepts were first developed you know
India was shut

00:01:17.929 --> 00:01:17.939
India was shut
 

00:01:17.939 --> 00:01:20.630
India was shut
China was shut most of Eastern Europe

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:20.640
China was shut most of Eastern Europe
 

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:23.359
China was shut most of Eastern Europe
was behind the Iron Curtain we didn't

00:01:23.359 --> 00:01:23.369
was behind the Iron Curtain we didn't
 

00:01:23.369 --> 00:01:25.429
was behind the Iron Curtain we didn't
have competition in markets from the

00:01:25.429 --> 00:01:25.439
have competition in markets from the
 

00:01:25.439 --> 00:01:28.280
have competition in markets from the
USSR so if you think about it American

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:28.290
USSR so if you think about it American
 

00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:32.090
USSR so if you think about it American
companies had a pretty big period of

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
companies had a pretty big period of
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:33.950
companies had a pretty big period of
stability in which they got to compete

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:33.960
stability in which they got to compete
 

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:36.050
stability in which they got to compete
and so the essence of competition back

00:01:36.050 --> 00:01:36.060
and so the essence of competition back
 

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:37.789
and so the essence of competition back
then was really about the classics right

00:01:37.789 --> 00:01:37.799
then was really about the classics right
 

00:01:37.799 --> 00:01:40.690
then was really about the classics right

optimization running efficiently because

00:01:42.980 --> 00:01:42.990
optimization running efficiently because
 

00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:44.660
optimization running efficiently because
that's what got you the real edge

00:01:44.660 --> 00:01:44.670
that's what got you the real edge
 

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.969
that's what got you the real edge
because you didn't have global

00:01:46.969 --> 00:01:46.979
because you didn't have global
 

00:01:46.979 --> 00:01:48.859
because you didn't have global
competition you didn't have the internet

00:01:48.859 --> 00:01:48.869
competition you didn't have the internet
 

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:50.600
competition you didn't have the internet
you didn't have digitization you didn't

00:01:50.600 --> 00:01:50.610
you didn't have digitization you didn't
 

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:53.330

something that four weeks later is worth

00:01:54.889 --> 00:01:54.899
something that four weeks later is worth
 

00:01:54.899 --> 00:01:56.209
something that four weeks later is worth
a billion dollars I mean you just didn't

00:01:56.209 --> 00:01:56.219
a billion dollars I mean you just didn't
 

00:01:56.219 --> 00:01:58.789
a billion dollars I mean you just didn't
have those phenomena and so I think what

00:01:58.789 --> 00:01:58.799
have those phenomena and so I think what
 

00:01:58.799 --> 00:02:01.580
have those phenomena and so I think what
we have clung to in strategy is this

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:01.590
we have clung to in strategy is this
 

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:04.039
we have clung to in strategy is this
notion of sustainable advantage for a

00:02:04.039 --> 00:02:04.049
notion of sustainable advantage for a
 

00:02:04.049 --> 00:02:05.749
notion of sustainable advantage for a
lot of reasons it was very traditional

00:02:05.749 --> 00:02:05.759
lot of reasons it was very traditional
 

00:02:05.759 --> 00:02:07.700
lot of reasons it was very traditional
it worked very well and the other big

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:07.710
it worked very well and the other big
 

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:09.650
it worked very well and the other big
secret I think behind this notion of

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:09.660
secret I think behind this notion of
 

00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:11.360
secret I think behind this notion of
sustainable advantage is there are a lot

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:11.370
sustainable advantage is there are a lot
 

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:13.290
sustainable advantage is there are a lot

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:15.490
along with it so in a relative position
 

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:17.520
along with it so in a relative position
in an industry relative market share is

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:17.530
in an industry relative market share is
 

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:19.440

up with very much this useful in fact

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:35.740
up with very much this useful in fact

you can't analyze your way to a
 

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.760
you can't analyze your way to a
competitive advantage at all and that

00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:38.770
competitive advantage at all and that
 

00:02:38.770 --> 00:02:40.830
competitive advantage at all and that
seems a little bit destabilizing so I

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:40.840
seems a little bit destabilizing so I
 

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:42.240
seems a little bit destabilizing so I
think people like to cling to what's

00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:42.250
think people like to cling to what's
 

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:44.190
think people like to cling to what's
familiar they like to cling to the tools

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:44.200
familiar they like to cling to the tools
 

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.200
familiar they like to cling to the tools
and concepts that they know best and

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:46.210
and concepts that they know best and
 

00:02:46.210 --> 00:02:47.430
and concepts that they know best and
that's why I think it's been such

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:47.440
that's why I think it's been such
 

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:50.250
that's why I think it's been such
adorable idea what's interesting also is

00:02:50.250 --> 00:02:50.260
adorable idea what's interesting also is
 

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.410
adorable idea what's interesting also is
the reaction that I've gotten to the

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.420
the reaction that I've gotten to the
 

00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:54.960
the reaction that I've gotten to the
book so the reaction to the book kind of

00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:54.970
book so the reaction to the book kind of
 

00:02:54.970 --> 00:02:56.850

falls in three buckets the so the first

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:56.860
falls in three buckets the so the first
 

00:02:56.860 --> 00:02:58.650
falls in three buckets the so the first
bucket is people who go oh no it doesn't

00:02:58.650 --> 00:02:58.660
bucket is people who go oh no it doesn't
 

00:02:58.660 --> 00:03:00.180

people who panic you know they just try

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:05.620
people who panic you know they just try

people who panic you know they just try
to change everything all at once they go

00:03:06.870 --> 00:03:06.880
to change everything all at once they go
 

00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.280
to change everything all at once they go
sprouting off in all directions and

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:08.290
sprouting off in all directions and
 

00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:10.260
sprouting off in all directions and
