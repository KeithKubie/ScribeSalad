00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.343
We can find the distance from our broken down car to the town by setting up a

00:00:03.343 --> 00:00:08.540
right triangle. We know the distance between the mile markers is 24, since we

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:14.234
can subtract the smaller mile marker from the larger one. So, this distance is

00:00:14.234 --> 00:00:19.320
24 miles, and our north south distance here is only 7 miles. That was the

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.120
distance from the interstate to the town. We're looking for this distance d.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.097
So, we'll have this leg squared plus this leg squared equals our hypotenuse

00:00:29.097 --> 00:00:37.433
squared. Squaring the legs, we'll get 576 plus 49 equals d squared. This sum is

00:00:37.433 --> 00:00:40.967
625, and then finally we will take the square root of both sides to solve for

00:00:40.967 --> 00:00:47.490
d. We only need the positive root of 625 since we are dealing with distance, so

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:52.633
d is equal to 25. So, if you had to pick which town to walk to, it's actually

00:00:52.633 --> 00:00:56.830
show to walk to town two. You have to walk 4 miles less than you would if you

00:00:56.830 --> 00:00:59.210
walked all the way to town 1.
