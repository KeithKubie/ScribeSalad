00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:08.069
The faculty elects the valedictorian
each year, taking into account special

00:00:08.069 --> 00:00:14.160
qualifications as well as scholastic
ranking. This year's valedictorian is

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:29.900
Kyle Berlin, a senior, a senior from
Arroyo Grande, California.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.690
Is my hair all right?

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:49.020
Alright, well thank you. I want to begin in

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:57.090
gratitude to, to everyone here and not
here who made everything possible from

00:00:57.090 --> 00:01:01.410
as President Eisgruber said, the facilities
staff who set up the thousands and

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.600
thousands and thousands of chairs, to the
faculty who set up the classrooms, and of

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:15.350
course the family and friends who set up
the love. There's a poem by Mark Doty

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:25.369
about a whale that swims around a harbor.
He writes, "I expected the worst:

00:01:25.369 --> 00:01:35.579
shallow water confusion, some accident to
bring the young humpback to grief." But he

00:01:35.579 --> 00:01:41.930
was wrong. The whale was not doomed, it
was merely playing in the shallow water.

00:01:41.930 --> 00:01:49.860
Doty goes on: "And though grief has seemed
to me itself a dim salt suspension in

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:57.750
which I've moved blind thing, day by day
through the wreckage, barely aware of

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:03.689
what I stumbled toward, even I couldn't
help but look at the way this immense

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:12.900
figure graces the dark medium, and shines
so: heaviness which is no burden to

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:18.720
itself.
What did you think, that joy was some

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:32.310
slight thing?" Doty's poem is called
"Visitation." My fellow graduates, our short

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.560
visit at Princeton University, at least
in this period of our short lives, has

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:45.000
come to an end. It is my task now to say
goodbye, to lend a few words of farewell

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:52.050
for our own visitation. I did not ask for
this task or strive for it, but it's been

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:55.680
given to me. I am to deliver the
valedictory address, which quite

00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:03.120
literally means the farewell address. So
the question before me now is what I

00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:10.140
could possibly say that may function as
a proper farewell for all of us? How do I

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:16.590
honor our togetherness and also our
apartness, our joy and our sorrow, and our

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:22.440
sorrow? Our position in time, our
contradictory and coexisting emotions

00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:29.130
floating through the air,
our heaviness and our lightness? What is

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:34.860
it that I wish you to know and to do as
we all walk out those gates in a few

00:03:34.860 --> 00:03:44.850
short minutes from now? I do not know the
answer. This is a deliberate statement

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:48.180
against self certainty, which this
university tends to exude, but it's also

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:55.110
quite simply true. I do not know what to
say. And I have to be honest, in true

00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.290
Princeton fashion, I was sitting right
over there last night sort of

00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:03.060
frantically writing this speech because
I really, I'm serious, I did not know what

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:08.070
to say in farewell, and, and I did not
think that I could speak to the feeling

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:14.400
of the moment before the arrival of the
moment, if you know what I mean. So here

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.020
we are now, though, in the heart of the
farewell, or the belly of the whale, so to

00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:26.250
speak, and just let's just breathe in for
a second with, with the sort of rhythm of

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:32.010
the giant cetacean lungs,
if you will, with the rhythm of the

00:04:32.010 --> 00:04:41.820
rustling trees around us on this
beautiful day. Because I genuinely did

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:46.230
not know what to say, and I do not think
myself particularly qualified to say it,

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:51.320
not least because I reject the
individuating effects of award culture.

00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:56.220
I've spent the last many weeks asking
everyone I encounter, what it is that

00:04:56.220 --> 00:05:02.760
they would say, that they wish everyone
would hear or know or do in farewell. And

00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:06.330
it's, it's really been a wonderful
opportunity to listen to what you all

00:05:06.330 --> 00:05:13.290
had to say and, and representative of the
best part of my time here: simply hanging

00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:18.120
out with with other people and
informally talking about things that

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.260
matter. And I wish there were time to
share all of the voices that I heard.

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:29.850
There are the people who told me to make
you laugh. And I'm, I'm sorry on that one.

00:05:29.850 --> 00:05:36.690
I recommend you just google the word
jokes. I don't have time. There are those

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:41.190
who would draw attention to the white
supremacy and class oppression of

00:05:41.190 --> 00:05:46.259
Princeton and the country beyond.

00:05:46.259 --> 00:05:51.850
There are those who told me to call out
rankings, elitism, hierarchy, and notions

00:05:51.850 --> 00:05:57.220
of a false meritocracy to speak for the
people who did not like Princeton, to

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:04.419
warn against pride or pride in excess.
There are those who would have me ask

00:06:04.419 --> 00:06:09.340
you to give up some of your economic
privilege and those who would draw

00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:13.599
attention to the climate catastrophe in
which we find ourselves that threatens

00:06:13.599 --> 00:06:21.099
the very existence of the most
vulnerable as well as our own lives. The

00:06:21.099 --> 00:06:27.130
list goes on and on and on and I really
really wish I had time or that those

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:31.990
people could come up here and talk as
well but I don't so I'm just my own

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:38.440
addition to this long list is simply
this. It is my parting wish that we find

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:44.800
it within us or outside of us - I don't
really care where you find it - to

00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:49.780
be able to truly listen to others and
develop a compassionate stance towards

00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:55.539
the world that moves beyond the tiny and
tenuous borders of the self, that silences

00:06:55.539 --> 00:07:01.380
the egoistic monologue assuredly
running in your head this very moment. I

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:07.150
mean this on small scales but also on
large ones, as we work to undo systemic

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:11.500
frameworks of oppression and equality
and injustice found everywhere, including

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:20.320
here. I mean it not simply or glibly or
romantically, not only to be nice but as

00:07:20.320 --> 00:07:26.409
a challenge, to approach a radical sort
of compassion that is awake and aware

00:07:26.409 --> 00:07:31.389
and attuned to our own position in the
world and how we are inextricably,

00:07:31.389 --> 00:07:39.150
achingly, necessarily entangled with,
entangled with others near and far.

00:07:44.989 --> 00:07:52.439
Particularly in this moment, where
meanness is mistaken for power, I wish

00:07:52.439 --> 00:07:57.989
for us to enact a compassionate
togetherness. The real work of our

00:07:57.989 --> 00:08:02.909
education and really our lives is to
figure out how we can better be alive

00:08:02.909 --> 00:08:09.719
together in the short and fragile space of
our visitation on earth. But, but we

00:08:09.719 --> 00:08:15.329
cannot do this on our own as individuals.
And, and my voice and, and that of people

00:08:15.329 --> 00:08:23.339
like me, with historically loud voices,
cannot be the only ones we hear. I mean

00:08:23.339 --> 00:08:30.689
it: this has to be a conversation, a
search, that we all commit to. And so I

00:08:30.689 --> 00:08:40.740
turn the question around to you. What
is it that that that you would would say

00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:47.250
to everyone? What is it that you think
everyone should know or do in this

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:53.250
moment of farewell, this very
rare and special moment. And this may

00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.639
make the beloved trustees
uncomfortable, but I'm just gonna

00:08:56.639 --> 00:08:59.939
literally ask you to turn to the people
around you and try to answer that

00:08:59.939 --> 00:09:05.100
question for one or two minutes. So the
question to review is, what would you say

00:09:05.100 --> 00:09:08.670
to everyone, what do you think everyone
should know or do before heading out. Two

00:09:08.670 --> 00:09:12.180
minutes: talk to people, introduce
yourself, look around. Okay I'm gonna jump

00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:15.779
down. I'll be right back. Don't worry, I
timed this. It's fine. We'll be fine all right.

00:09:15.779 --> 00:09:17.809
[APPLAUSE, CHEERS]

00:11:33.459 --> 00:11:37.760
They're probably getting stressed up
here, so I better bring it back. And and

00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:42.079
sorry to cut off your conversations. I
hope that they're productive, awkward or

00:11:42.079 --> 00:11:47.300
uncomfortable in good ways. So, I had
some great conversations, so thank you to

00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:49.399
my conversational partners who I'd never
met before.

00:11:49.399 --> 00:11:57.019
Um anyway, by way of conclusion, by final
farewell, let me just say that well, we

00:11:57.019 --> 00:12:03.470
want things to end and we want them not
to end. We want change and we want

00:12:03.470 --> 00:12:09.860
everything to stay the same, termination
and germination. Sitting here on

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:15.410
graduation day, we are ready to leave and
we are sorry to leave. We are thrilled to

00:12:15.410 --> 00:12:22.399
leave and loathe to leave, to wave our
hands tenderly or raise our middle

00:12:22.399 --> 00:12:29.690
fingers at this hallowed hall behind me,
to give our hugs and shed our tears for

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:37.779
different reasons, to say goodbye, to
never look back or to come running back.

00:12:37.779 --> 00:12:48.709
Look around. Look at us. The shape of our
faces, the depth of our eyes, the delicacy

00:12:48.709 --> 00:12:55.570
of our skin, the pattern on the bark on
the trees, the clouds in the sky.

00:12:55.570 --> 00:13:02.380
Remember who is not here, 
who's been lost along the way.

00:13:02.380 --> 00:13:11.480
Sense this sudden and temporary us. 
In us, in this moment. In us, right here, right

00:13:11.480 --> 00:13:17.630
now, on graduation day, in this space
between, surrounded by people we love and

00:13:17.630 --> 00:13:29.060
who love us. This is sacred. The Class of
2018, what if we gave up greatness for

00:13:29.060 --> 00:13:35.360
quiet compassion? What if we were number
one not in excellence, with all its

00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:40.279
disciplinarian and utilitarian and
egoistic undertones but in compassionate

00:13:40.279 --> 00:13:44.310
listening or repeated forgiveness or
radical love?

00:13:44.310 --> 00:13:51.420
I do not have a prescription to make
this happen only in imagination. And, and

00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:57.060
if we can't figure it out together, if if
we can't ask the right questions, can't

00:13:57.060 --> 00:14:03.210
forgive each other again and again, can't
practice kindness as a deliberate ethos

00:14:03.210 --> 00:14:13.589
and a knowledge, then who can? What else
matters? There are concrete things we can

00:14:13.589 --> 00:14:20.070
do. Let's do them. Let's let's walk out
those gates before going our separate

00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:28.440
ways resolved to working towards a more
compassionate, more just world. I have a

00:14:28.440 --> 00:14:37.100
feeling this may be the way towards the
richest sort of joy, a shared joy.

00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:56.639
Parabéns felicitaciones, congratulations
to the compassionate Class of 2018!
