00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:04.970
NARRATOR: Today, we're
showcasing all the engineering

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:07.580
design that our seniors
have been doing.

00:00:07.580 --> 00:00:10.520
So it's a yearlong project,
where a lot of the majors

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.520
interact with other
engineering majors,

00:00:12.520 --> 00:00:16.730
so you'll have mechanical,
aerospace, electrical, civil,

00:00:16.730 --> 00:00:18.762
mining engineers all
working on one project.

00:00:18.762 --> 00:00:21.220
And today's the day that we're
showing everybody what we've

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:23.660
been working on the whole year.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:26.480
 All the seniors in engineering
have been putting together

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.100
projects that have been funded
by industry professionals, so

00:00:31.100 --> 00:00:32.810
my professional's Honeywell.

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:36.770
And they work in industry
building your aircraft engines

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:39.110
and stuff like that, so
it's a great opportunity

00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.340
for seniors to get immersed
before they graduate and work

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:45.896
on real life projects.

00:00:45.896 --> 00:00:48.020
NARRATOR: I think the best
thing about this project

00:00:48.020 --> 00:00:51.500
is that for so long we've
been working in class,

00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:54.020
working on mathematics,
working on theory,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:58.052
and this project actually allows
us to apply in a high level way

00:00:58.052 --> 00:00:59.510
the things that
we've been learning

00:00:59.510 --> 00:01:01.718
to see the real world
applications of the engineering

00:01:01.718 --> 00:01:03.530
concepts.

00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:05.872
 My passion's
aerospace engineering.

00:01:05.872 --> 00:01:07.580
And so being able to
talk about a project

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.190
that I've worked
on in that field

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:11.700
is just a lot of fun for me.

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.120
I like being able to share
some of that information

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.760
with people who think
our project's cool

00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:19.265
and talking to people who
are younger engineering

00:01:19.265 --> 00:01:21.890
students, who maybe want to get
involved with some of the stuff

00:01:21.890 --> 00:01:24.230
that we're working on.

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.480
I think that's my
favorite part is just

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:29.440
kind of sharing what we've
done with other people.
