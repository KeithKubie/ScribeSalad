00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
[ Quiz: What does s, t = t, s do? ]

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So, the answer is, it actually swaps the value of "s" and "t."

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
This is quite convenient,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
and the important reason for that is

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000
both the values on the right side get evaluated first--

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
to get turned into their values--

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
before we do any of the assignments.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
So, what's going on:

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
"s" refers to some value--

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
let's call that "alpha"--

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
and "t" refers to some value--

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
we'll call that "beta."

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
This is before the assignments.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000
To evaluate the multiple assignment expression,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.000
we find the value of "t" here [indicating the second "t" in the expression]--

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.000
that has the value of "beta"--

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
and we find the value of "s"--

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
and "s" has the value of "alpha."

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.000
We've evaluated both of these,

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.000
and we've turned them into the values the names refer to;

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.000
and, now we do the assignments.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
So, "s" will be changed to refer to the first value--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.000
which is "beta" Ã¢Â€Â“

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000
and "t" will be changed to refer to the second value.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
This has very different behavior

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000
than if we did two assignments like this;

00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000
so, if we tried, instead, doing "assign t to s,"

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000
and then "assign s to t,"

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that wouldn't swap the values,

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000
because, by the time we do the second assignment,

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000
the value of "s" has changed--

00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:10.000
now it refers to whatever the value of "t" was.

00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:12.000
If we had done these two statements {indicating "s = t" and "t = s"],

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:14.000
both of them would end up having the value "beta."
