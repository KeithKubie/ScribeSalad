00:00:06.574 --> 00:00:12.738
The earliest known pregnancy test
dates back to 1350 BC in Ancient Egypt.

00:00:12.738 --> 00:00:14.829
According to the Egyptians,

00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:20.066
all you have to do is urinate on wheat 
and barley seeds, and wait.

00:00:20.066 --> 00:00:23.668
If either sprouts, 
congratulations, you're pregnant!

00:00:23.668 --> 00:00:28.962
And if wheat sprouts faster, it's a girl,
but if barley, it's a boy.

00:00:28.962 --> 00:00:32.404
In 1963, a small study 
reproduced this test

00:00:32.404 --> 00:00:37.097
and found that it predicted pregnancy
with a respectable 70% accuracy,

00:00:37.097 --> 00:00:40.752
though it couldn't reliably 
tell the sex of the baby.

00:00:40.752 --> 00:00:43.396
Scientists hypothesized 
that the test worked

00:00:43.396 --> 00:00:46.561
because pregnant women's urine
contains more estrogen,

00:00:46.561 --> 00:00:48.750
which can promote seed growth.

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:52.091
Now it's easy to take 
this ancient method for granted

00:00:52.091 --> 00:00:57.138
because modern pregnancy tests give
highly accurate results within minutes.

00:00:57.138 --> 00:00:59.050
So how do they work?

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.228
Over-the-counter pregnancy tests
are all designed to detect one thing:

00:01:03.228 --> 00:01:05.888
a hormone called HCG.

00:01:05.888 --> 00:01:09.300
HCG is produced in 
the earliest stages of pregnancy

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:10.870
and starts a game of telephone

00:01:10.870 --> 00:01:15.015
that tells the body not to shed 
the inner lining of the uterus that month.

00:01:15.015 --> 00:01:16.649
As the pregnancy progresses,

00:01:16.649 --> 00:01:19.799
HCG supports the formation
of the placenta,

00:01:19.799 --> 00:01:23.653
which transfers nutrients 
from mother to fetus.

00:01:23.653 --> 00:01:28.090
The test starts when urine is applied
to the exposed end of the strip.

00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:30.850
As the fluid travels up 
the absorbent fibers,

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.366
it will cross three separate zones,
each with an important task.

00:01:35.366 --> 00:01:38.995
When the wave hits the first zone,
the reaction zone,

00:01:38.995 --> 00:01:44.993
Y-shaped proteins called antibodies
will grab onto any HCG.

00:01:44.993 --> 00:01:47.810
Attached to these antibodies
is a handy enzyme

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.623
with the ability to turn on dye molecules,
which will be crucial later down the road.

00:01:53.623 --> 00:01:56.586
Then the urine picks up 
all the AB1 enzymes

00:01:56.586 --> 00:02:00.849
and carries them to the test zone,
which is where the results show up.

00:02:00.849 --> 00:02:03.879
Secured to this zone are more
Y-shaped antibodies

00:02:03.879 --> 00:02:08.883
that will also stick to HCG
on one of its five binding sites.

00:02:08.883 --> 00:02:12.223
Scientists call this type of test
a sandwich assay.

00:02:12.223 --> 00:02:19.068
If HCG is present, it gets sandwiched
between the AB1 enzyme and AB2,

00:02:19.068 --> 00:02:20.930
and sticks to the test zone,

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:24.240
allowing the attached dye-activating
enzyme to do its job

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:26.615
and create a visible pattern.

00:02:26.615 --> 00:02:31.621
If there's no HCG, the wave of urine
and enzymes just passes on by.

00:02:31.621 --> 00:02:36.446
Finally, there's one last stop to make,
the control zone.

00:02:36.446 --> 00:02:38.398
As in any good experiment,

00:02:38.398 --> 00:02:41.621
this step confirms that 
the test is working properly.

00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:44.926
Whether the AB1 enzymes never saw HCG,

00:02:44.926 --> 00:02:48.744
or they're extras because Zone 1
is overstocked with them,

00:02:48.744 --> 00:02:53.626
all the unbound AB1 enzymes picked up
in Zone 1 should end up here

00:02:53.626 --> 00:02:55.743
and activate more dye.

00:02:55.743 --> 00:03:00.082
So if no pattern appears,
that indicates that the test was faulty.

00:03:00.082 --> 00:03:03.453
These tests are pretty reliable,
but they're not failproof.

00:03:03.453 --> 00:03:05.336
For instance, false negatives can occur

00:03:05.336 --> 00:03:09.639
if concentrations of HCG 
aren't high enough for detection.

00:03:09.639 --> 00:03:13.501
After implantation, HCG levels double
every two to three days,

00:03:13.501 --> 00:03:16.453
so it may just be too early to tell.

00:03:16.453 --> 00:03:18.519
And beverages can dilute the urine sample,

00:03:18.519 --> 00:03:22.878
which is why doctors recommend taking
the test first thing in the morning.

00:03:22.878 --> 00:03:27.374
On the other hand, false positives
can come from other sources of HCG,

00:03:27.374 --> 00:03:30.456
like IVF injections, ectopic pregnancies,

00:03:30.456 --> 00:03:34.440
or certain cancers such as uterine cancer
or testicular cancer,

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:39.482
making it possible for one of these tests
to tell a man he's pregnant.

00:03:39.482 --> 00:03:43.848
The best way for a woman to find out 
for sure is at the doctor's office.

00:03:43.848 --> 00:03:46.373
The doctors are also looking for HCG,

00:03:46.373 --> 00:03:49.802
but with tests that are more sensitive
and quantitative,

00:03:49.802 --> 00:03:54.530
which means they can determine
the exact level of HCG in your blood.

00:03:54.530 --> 00:03:56.936
A few minutes can feel like forever

00:03:56.936 --> 00:04:00.209
when you're waiting on the results 
of a pregnancy test.

00:04:00.209 --> 00:04:04.548
But in that brief time, you're witnessing
the power of the scientific method.

00:04:04.548 --> 00:04:07.211
That one little stick 
lets you ask a question,

00:04:07.211 --> 00:04:09.277
perform a controlled experiment,

00:04:09.277 --> 00:04:13.058
and then analyze the results
to check your original hypothesis.

00:04:13.058 --> 00:04:17.455
And the best part is you won't even
have to wait until the next harvest.
