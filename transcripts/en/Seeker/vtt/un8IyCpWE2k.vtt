00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:04.670
For centuries we’ve been warned of the dangers
that lurk deep below the ocean’s surface.

00:00:04.670 --> 00:00:08.940
Maybe there’s a horrifying colossal squid,
or a Kraken, or an evil villain’s lair.

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.099
As it turns out, the reality is far worse.

00:00:14.099 --> 00:00:19.609
Hey there polluting population, Jules here
for DNews!

00:00:19.609 --> 00:00:24.060
The Mariana Trench is the deepest known part
of the ocean, stretching down roughly 36,000

00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:25.060
feet.

00:00:25.060 --> 00:00:29.220
You’d imagine that at those depths, the
ocean floor is pristine, almost untouched

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.220
by human activity.

00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.000
Well, I’ve got some bad news for ya.

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.520
Turns out, the bottom of the ocean is very,
very polluted.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:39.790
And that’s not some click-bait hyperbole;
it is more polluted than some of the most

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:42.360
polluted regions on the surface of the globe.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:47.140
One probe into the Marianas Trench only had
to go about 16,000 feet down to find physical

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.500
remnants of actual garbage, not just waste
byproducts.

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.080
Beer cans, plastic bags, even an entire, unopened
can of SPAM was found resting along the Trench’s

00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.080
wall.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:01.220
And unless it is removed, this trash can stay
down there indefinitely, just piling up.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.100
Plastics, for example, are made up of super-strong
carbon to carbon bonds.

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:09.549
These bonds are not prone to being broken
down by organic organisms; the material hasn’t

00:01:09.549 --> 00:01:13.060
existed in nature long enough for there to
have evolved much to break it down.

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:18.490
In 2016 scientists found one type of microbe
that can do it, but only for a specific type

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:19.619
of plastic.

00:01:19.619 --> 00:01:24.670
And even if we could solve this physical trash
problem, there lies an even deeper problem.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.670
Literally.

00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:30.170
In late 2016, a paper published in the journal
Nature, examined the inhabitants of two of

00:01:30.170 --> 00:01:32.380
the deepest oceanic trenches in the world.

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:37.060
Small little crustaceans called amphipods
are the perfect study specimen, as they have

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:40.979
fatty tissue, which stores not just fat but
also any chemicals that are ingested.

00:01:40.979 --> 00:01:45.340
And despite these amphipods being located
in two different parts of the world, thousands

00:01:45.340 --> 00:01:50.639
of feet below the surface, they were ALL contaminated
by what are called “persistent organic pollutants”

00:01:50.639 --> 00:01:51.740
or POPs.

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:55.210
“Persistent” meaning that they don’t
break down in their environment, and are almost

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:56.850
impossible to remove.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:02:00.820
These include chemicals that have been banned
from use for decades, at least in the United

00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.810
States, like polychlorinated biphenyls, which
have been shown to be birth defect and cancer-causing.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.190
Other chemicals like pesticides were present
as well.

00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.550
The concentration of POPs was SO high that
it was 50 times greater than in one of China’s

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:18.640
most polluted rivers, and was roughly equal
to that of Suruga Bay in Japan, an industrial

00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.860
waste dumping ground.

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:23.200
So, how did this pollution make it all the
way down there?

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:27.040
Well the researchers suggest that, in the
case of the Mariana Trench, it may have to

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:30.230
do with a little something called the Great
Pacific Garbage Patch.

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:34.820
While there are many areas where trash congregates
in the ocean, the paper refers to a huge floating

00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:38.930
clump of garbage in the Northwest Pacific
ocean that floats just near the Mariana’s

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.540
Trench, and so plastics and other chemicals
end up sinking to its depths.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.590
There’s another theory that the pollution
found down there is the result of POP chemicals

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:48.010
entering the food chain.

00:02:48.010 --> 00:02:51.120
The amphipods that live in these deep waters
are scavengers.

00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:54.930
When a larger animal, like a dolphin or a
whale, dies, it slowly sinks to the bottom

00:02:54.930 --> 00:02:58.590
of the ocean floor, a phenomenon known as
carrion-falls.

00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:02.570
If this carrion lived in polluted waters,
then it could have pollution in its system,

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:05.290
and that pollution would persist in animals
that eat it.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:09.210
The paper does say that this is unlikely,
however, given that there is consistent contamination

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:10.430
at different depths.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.000
But either of these theories for how the POPs
got so deep would be a huge problem for us

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000
humans.

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.850
If these chemicals are so persistent within
the food chain, then they eventually reach

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:22.660
our own food supply, contaminating it with
our own contaminants.

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:25.760
But it isn’t just bad for us, it’s bad
for every living thing.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:29.800
Ocean pollution saps the amount of oxygen
in the water, which can lead to mass death

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.970
of marine life.

00:03:30.970 --> 00:03:35.760
Certain chemicals can even create reproductive
issues for animals in the ocean, so even if

00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:38.370
they do survive, they can’t do much for
their species.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:43.590
Society has spent the last few centuries dumping
tons of trash into the ocean, including industrial

00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:46.900
waste, radioactive waste, munitions, and sewage.

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:51.590
The EPA says, quote, “Wastes were frequently
dumped in coastal and ocean waters based on

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:56.300
the assumption that marine waters had an unlimited
capacity to mix and disperse wastes.”

00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:58.370
But now we’re learning that this isn’t
really the case.

00:03:58.370 --> 00:04:03.690
The out of sight out, of mind is killing ocean
creatures and endangering our own health.

00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:06.320
It turns out nowhere is safe from pollution.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.180
Not even the deepest part of the ocean.

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:10.210
