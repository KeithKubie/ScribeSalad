00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:29.370
 [Applause] 

00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.870
 their majesties 

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.870
 his royal highnesses 

00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.440
 distinguished members of the Norwegian committee 

00:00:38.650 --> 00:00:41.190
 of the nobel 

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.469
 [Music] 

00:00:41.190 --> 00:00:45.469
 dear citizens of colombia 

00:00:45.610 --> 00:00:51.810
 citizens of the world ladies and gentlemen 

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.620
 only 6 years ago 

00:00:55.390 --> 00:01:02.260
 we Colombians did not dare to 

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:07.260
 imagine the end of a war that 

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:07.260
 we had suffered for half a century 

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:14.310
 for the vast majority of us 

00:01:10.409 --> 00:01:18.880
 Peace seemed an impossible dream 

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:23.649
 and so it was for obvious reasons 

00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:27.420
 because very few almost nobody remembered 

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:30.939
 what it was like to live in a country in peace today 

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:34.350
 after six years of serious and often 

00:01:30.939 --> 00:01:39.310
 intense difficult negotiations 

00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:42.340
 I can announce to you and the world with 

00:01:39.310 --> 00:01:44.230
 deep humility and gratitude that the 

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:47.170
 town of colombia 

00:01:44.230 --> 00:01:51.910
 with the support of our friends from all 

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:54.260
 the planet is making possible what 

00:01:51.910 --> 00:01:57.200
 impossible 

00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.470
 the war that caused so much suffering and 

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:04.790
 anguish to our population throughout 

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:07.480
 and the width of our beautiful country has 

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.480
 finished 

00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:26.390
 just like life peace is a 

00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:31.130
 process that brings us many surprises 

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:34.620
 only two months ago the Colombians 

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:36.900
 and in fact the whole world is 

00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:39.540
 impacted when in a plebiscite 

00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:43.530
 convened to endorse the agreement of 

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:46.740
 peace with the farc the votes of the no 

00:02:43.530 --> 00:02:48.860
 exceeded by a narrow margin the 

00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.590
 yes votes 

00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.040
 it was a result that nobody imagined 

00:02:52.590 --> 00:02:58.439
 a week before in Cartagena 

00:02:56.040 --> 00:03:01.140
 we had lit a flame of 

00:02:58.439 --> 00:03:04.230
 hope by signing the agreement in 

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:08.879
 presence of world leaders and 

00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:11.209
 now suddenly this flame seemed 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:11.209
 to become extinct 

00:03:11.430 --> 00:03:18.420
 many of us remember then a passage of 

00:03:14.849 --> 00:03:21.460
 100 years of solitude the masterpiece of 

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:24.790
 our Nobel Prize Garcia Marquez 

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:27.420
 that in some way reflected what 

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:27.420
 was going on 

00:03:28.410 --> 00:03:36.420
 it was as if God had decided to put 

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:39.140
 to test every capacity for wonder and 

00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:42.960
 keep the inhabitants of Macondo 

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:48.600
 in a permanent swing between the 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:50.280
 joy and disenchantment doubt and 

00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:53.069
 revelation 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:57.630
 to the point that no one could 

00:03:53.069 --> 00:04:01.580
 know for sure where were the 

00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.580
 limits of reality 

00:04:02.090 --> 00:04:07.120
 we Colombians felt like 

00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:10.980
 inhabitants of macondo 

00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:13.460
 a place not only magical but also 

00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:16.430
 contradictory 

00:04:13.460 --> 00:04:18.500
 as head of state I understood the 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:21.860
 significance of this adverse result 

00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:25.040
 and immediately summon a great 

00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:27.300
 national dialogue for union and 

00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.360
 reconciliation 

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:34.050
 I decided to turn this setback into a 

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:37.110
 opportunity to reach the widest 

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:39.810
 consensus that would make possible a new 

00:04:37.110 --> 00:04:42.240
 agreement I dedicated myself to listen to 

00:04:39.810 --> 00:04:45.990
 concerns and suggestions from those 

00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:49.590
 they voted no and of those who voted yes and 

00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:54.240
 also from those who did not vote they were 

00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:58.669
 most to achieve a new and better 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:05:02.060
 I agree an agreement that all Colombia 

00:04:58.669 --> 00:05:02.060
 I could support 

00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:10.180
 it had not been four days since the 

00:05:06.530 --> 00:05:14.930
 surprising plebiscite when the committee 

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:19.100
 Norwegian announced a decision equally 

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:22.200
 surprising about the granting of 

00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:24.510
 Nobel Peace Prize 

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:27.990
 and I must confess 

00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.249
 that this news came as a gift 

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:32.589
 from the sky 

00:05:30.249 --> 00:05:34.760
 at a time when our boat 

00:05:32.589 --> 00:05:38.330
 it seemed to drift 

00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:40.510
 the Nobel prize was the stern wind 

00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:46.000
 what prompted us 

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:50.730
 to reach our destination the port 

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.730
 of peace thank you very much thank you 

00:06:02.090 --> 00:06:06.490
 Thank you 

00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:10.210
 thank you very much for this vote of 

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:11.500
 confidence and faith in my future 

00:06:10.210 --> 00:06:14.050
 country 

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:17.110
 today distinguished committee members 

00:06:14.050 --> 00:06:21.310
 Norwegian I come to tell you to 

00:06:17.110 --> 00:06:25.420
 you and through you to the community 

00:06:21.310 --> 00:06:29.080
 international that we achieved we got to 

00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:32.830
 port today we have in Colombia a new 

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:35.770
 agreement for the termination of 

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:39.220
 armed conflict with the farc that welcomes 

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:40.820
 most of the proposals that we 

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:43.310
 made 

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:46.280
 this new agreement was signed two years ago 

00:06:43.310 --> 00:06:48.880
 weeks and the week was endorsed 

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:52.730
 passed by the congress of the republic 

00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:55.340
 by an overwhelming majority so that 

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:58.040
 begin to join our 

00:06:55.340 --> 00:07:00.230
 normativity 

00:06:58.040 --> 00:07:03.290
 the long-awaited process of 

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:07.420
 implementation has already started with the contribution 

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:09.640
 priceless of the united nations' 

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:12.820
 with this new agreement ends the 

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:15.630
 older armed conflict and the last 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:20.220
 of the Western Hemisphere 

00:07:15.630 --> 00:07:23.310
 with this agreement as Alfred ordered 

00:07:20.220 --> 00:07:26.490
 nobel in his testament begins the 

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:29.490
 dismantling an army in this 

00:07:26.490 --> 00:07:32.550
 case an irregular army and its 

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:34.289
 conversion into a political movement 

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:37.949
 legal 

00:07:34.289 --> 00:07:41.539
 with this agreement we can say that 

00:07:37.949 --> 00:07:45.090
 america from alaska to patagonia 

00:07:41.539 --> 00:07:50.310
 it is a zone of peace 

00:07:45.090 --> 00:07:52.440
 and we can ask ourselves a bold question 

00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.730
 if the war 

00:07:52.440 --> 00:08:00.380
 may end up in a hemisphere because 

00:07:56.730 --> 00:08:04.470
 can not someday both hemispheres 

00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:09.110
 be free of it 

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:12.900
 maybe today more than ever we can 

00:08:09.110 --> 00:08:14.490
 dare to imagine a world without 

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:20.539
 war 

00:08:14.490 --> 00:08:20.539
 the impossible can be possible 

00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.550
 alfred nobel the great visionary whose 

00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:45.360
 legacy brings us together today 

00:08:41.550 --> 00:08:48.050
 on the exact day when 120 are met 

00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:50.740
 years of his death 

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:53.830
 wrote sometime 

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:58.050
 that war is the horror of the 

00:08:53.830 --> 00:09:01.160
 horrors the greatest of crimes 

00:08:58.050 --> 00:09:04.710
 the war can not be in any way 

00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:08.010
 an end in itself 

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:12.840
 it's just a medium and a medium that 

00:09:08.010 --> 00:09:15.950
 we should always try to avoid 

00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:18.560
 I have been a leader in times of war 

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.590
 to defend freedom and rights 

00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:24.320
 of Colombians 

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:27.290
 and I've been a leader to make peace 

00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.460
 that's why I can tell you from experience 

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:34.780
 own that is much harder to do the 

00:09:31.460 --> 00:09:37.960
 peace to make war 

00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:40.930
 when it is necessary we must be 

00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:42.640
 prepared to fight and to me 

00:09:40.930 --> 00:09:44.890
 corresponded 

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.550
 as defense minister and as 

00:09:44.890 --> 00:09:51.850
 president fight the armed groups 

00:09:48.550 --> 00:09:55.090
 illegal in my country and I did it with 

00:09:51.850 --> 00:09:59.730
 effectiveness and forcefulness when 

00:09:55.090 --> 00:10:04.050
 paths of peace were closed 

00:09:59.730 --> 00:10:06.660
 however it is foolish to think that the 

00:10:04.050 --> 00:10:09.480
 end of conflicts be the extermination 

00:10:06.660 --> 00:10:13.110
 of the counterpart 

00:10:09.480 --> 00:10:16.740
 the final victory for weapons when 

00:10:13.110 --> 00:10:20.670
 there are non-violent alternatives is not 

00:10:16.740 --> 00:10:22.490
 other than the defeat of the spirit 

00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:26.089
 human 

00:10:22.490 --> 00:10:29.209
 beat by arms annihilate the 

00:10:26.089 --> 00:10:31.810
 enemy bring the war to their 

00:10:29.209 --> 00:10:31.810
 last consequences 

00:10:31.830 --> 00:10:38.910
 is to give up to see in the opposite to 

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:41.720
 another human being to someone with whom 

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:41.720
 can you talk 

00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:47.980
 and dialogue 

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:52.040
 respecting the dignity of all that is 

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:54.709
 what we did in colombia 

00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:59.480
 and that's why I have the honor of being today 

00:10:54.709 --> 00:11:02.730
 here sharing what we learned in 

00:10:59.480 --> 00:11:07.209
 our hard experience 

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:10.179
 the first step 1 crucial 

00:11:07.209 --> 00:11:11.680
 was to stop seeing the guerrillas as 

00:11:10.179 --> 00:11:15.339
 enemies 

00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:17.840
 to consider them simply as 

00:11:15.339 --> 00:11:20.900
 adversaries 

00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:23.960
 the general valencia tovar álvaro 

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:27.560
 valencia tovar who was commander 

00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:32.570
 of the army of colombia historian and 

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:36.240
 humanist taught me this difference he 

00:11:32.570 --> 00:11:39.420
 he said that the word enemy 

00:11:36.240 --> 00:11:44.040
 it has a connotation of passional struggle 

00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:46.430
 and hate that does not correspond to honor 

00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:46.430
 military 

00:11:47.110 --> 00:11:54.160
 Humanizing the war is not only limiting 

00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:57.610
 its cruelty but also recognize in the 

00:11:54.160 --> 00:12:00.000
 contricante to a similar to a being 

00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:00.000
 human 

00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:08.110
 historians calculate that during 

00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:13.120
 the 20th century they died up to 187 million 

00:12:08.110 --> 00:12:15.470
 of people because of the wars 187 

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:19.210
 millions 

00:12:15.470 --> 00:12:23.210
 each of them was a human life 

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:25.850
 priceless someone loved by his family 

00:12:23.210 --> 00:12:29.569
 and your loved ones 

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:32.560
 and tragically the account keeps growing 

00:12:29.569 --> 00:12:32.560
 in this century 

00:12:33.170 --> 00:12:38.610
 it is good to remember now the incisive 

00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:40.920
 question of bob dylan 

00:12:38.610 --> 00:12:43.230
 my colleague at the reception of the prize 

00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:46.980
 nobel this year 

00:12:43.230 --> 00:12:49.910
 that moved us so much in the years 

00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:52.910
 sixties to those of us who were young 

00:12:49.910 --> 00:12:52.910
 so 

00:12:53.059 --> 00:13:00.379
 how many more deaths will be necessary 

00:12:56.529 --> 00:13:02.660
 until we understand that they have died 

00:13:00.379 --> 00:13:05.880
 too many 

00:13:02.660 --> 00:13:08.630
 the answer to my friend 

00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:11.990
 it goes flying with the wind 

00:13:08.630 --> 00:13:16.070
 the answer my friend is blowing in the 

00:13:11.990 --> 00:13:19.520
 wind spline with the wind 

00:13:16.070 --> 00:13:21.279
 when they asked me if I aspired to 

00:13:19.520 --> 00:13:26.220
 prize 

00:13:21.279 --> 00:13:28.560
 I always answered that it was for me 

00:13:26.220 --> 00:13:32.160
 the real prize 

00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:36.630
 the peace of my country because that is the 

00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:40.020
 true prize the peace of my country 

00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:43.620
 and that peace is not from a president or from 

00:13:40.020 --> 00:13:47.090
 a government but of all the people 

00:13:43.620 --> 00:13:50.210
 Colombian, we have to build it 

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:50.210
 among all 

00:13:50.540 --> 00:13:55.570
 that's why this award I receive on behalf 

00:13:52.970 --> 00:13:58.579
 of about 50 million Colombians 

00:13:55.570 --> 00:14:01.970
 my compatriots 

00:13:58.579 --> 00:14:04.819
 who finally see a nightmare 

00:14:01.970 --> 00:14:10.950
 of more than half a century that only brought 

00:14:04.819 --> 00:14:14.100
 pain misery and backwardness to our nation 

00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:16.620
 and the receipts mostly on behalf of 

00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.710
 the victims of more than 8 million 

00:14:16.620 --> 00:14:24.170
 victims and displaced persons whose lives have 

00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:29.529
 been devastated by the armed conflict 

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:33.639
 and more than 220,000 women, men and children 

00:14:29.529 --> 00:14:37.420
 that to our shame they have been 

00:14:33.639 --> 00:14:37.420
 killed in this war 

00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:43.590
 the experts tell me that the process of 

00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:47.040
 Peace in Colombia is the first in 

00:14:43.590 --> 00:14:51.110
 world that he has put in the center of his 

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:54.740
 solution to victims and their rights 

00:14:51.110 --> 00:14:58.200
 We advance this negotiation by making a 

00:14:54.740 --> 00:15:03.660
 great emphasis on human rights 

00:14:58.200 --> 00:15:06.800
 and from this we are very proud 

00:15:03.660 --> 00:15:10.250
 the victims want justice 

00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.580
 but more than anything they want the truth 

00:15:10.250 --> 00:15:16.400
 and they want with a generous spirit that they do not 

00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:19.150
 there are new victims who suffer what 

00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:19.150
 They suffered 

00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:26.500
 the professor ronald hitfix founder of 

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:28.269
 school leadership center 

00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:31.540
 Kennedy of Government of the University of 

00:15:28.269 --> 00:15:33.449
 harvard where I graduated from gave me a 

00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:36.350
 wise advice 

00:15:33.449 --> 00:15:39.839
 He told me when he feels discouraged 

00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:43.079
 tired pessimist always talk to the 

00:15:39.839 --> 00:15:47.390
 victims are they who will give 

00:15:43.079 --> 00:15:51.200
 encouragement and strength to continue 

00:15:47.390 --> 00:15:53.840
 and that's always been the way I could talk to 

00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:57.130
 the victims of this war and I listened 

00:15:53.840 --> 00:16:00.690
 its heartbreaking stories 

00:15:57.130 --> 00:16:03.780
 some of them are here today 

00:16:00.690 --> 00:16:09.160
 reminding us why it is so important 

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:10.870
 that we build a stable peace and 

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:13.480
 durable 

00:16:10.870 --> 00:16:15.520
 I would like to ask the victims here 

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:17.110
 present on behalf of the 

00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:19.930
 victims of the armed conflict in 

00:16:17.110 --> 00:16:24.270
 colombia that stand up so that 

00:16:19.930 --> 00:16:24.270
 receive the homage they deserve 

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:21.880
 liner palaces lane the palaces is a 

00:17:17.350 --> 00:17:23.610
 of those victims on May 2 of the year 

00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:27.480
 2002 

00:17:23.610 --> 00:17:30.240
 a rudimentary mortar thrown by the 

00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:32.100
 farc in the middle of a fight with the 

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:35.299
 paramilitaries 

00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:37.860
 He fell in the church of his people there 

00:17:35.299 --> 00:17:39.779
 where its inhabitants had searched 

00:17:37.860 --> 00:17:43.769
 refuge 

00:17:39.779 --> 00:17:48.899
 Nearly 80 women men died and 

00:17:43.769 --> 00:17:50.249
 children most children in question 

00:17:48.899 --> 00:17:54.299
 seconds 

00:17:50.249 --> 00:18:00.260
 Leiner lost 32 family members 

00:17:54.299 --> 00:18:03.890
 his parents and three younger siblings 

00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:07.430
 the farc have asked forgiveness for this 

00:18:03.890 --> 00:18:12.250
 atrocious fact and leiner that is now a 

00:18:07.430 --> 00:18:12.250
 community leader has forgiven them 

00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:39.210
 and that is the great paradox with which I 

00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.880
 I have found while many who have not 

00:18:39.210 --> 00:18:45.539
 suffered in the flesh the conflict 

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:49.470
 resist peace are the victims the 

00:18:45.539 --> 00:18:53.940
 victims the most willing to forgive 

00:18:49.470 --> 00:18:58.850
 reconcile and face the future with 

00:18:53.940 --> 00:18:58.850
 a heart free of hate 

00:18:59.330 --> 00:19:04.250
 This prize also belongs to the 

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:07.790
 men and women that with huge 

00:19:04.250 --> 00:19:11.210
 patience and strength negotiated in the 

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:14.210
 habana during all these years they 

00:19:11.210 --> 00:19:18.260
 they reached an agreement that today we can 

00:19:14.210 --> 00:19:21.230
 offer as a model for the solution of 

00:19:18.260 --> 00:19:22.730
 the armed conflicts that subsist in 

00:19:21.230 --> 00:19:24.919
 the planet 

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:27.590
 and I mean both the negotiators 

00:19:24.919 --> 00:19:30.530
 of the government here present as to the 

00:19:27.590 --> 00:19:35.779
 of the farc my adversaries who 

00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:38.059
 they demonstrated a great will for peace 

00:19:35.779 --> 00:19:40.999
 I want to exalt that will of 

00:19:38.059 --> 00:19:45.670
 embrace to achieve peace because without 

00:19:40.999 --> 00:19:49.270
 she the process would have failed 

00:19:45.670 --> 00:19:52.540
 and I also dedicate this award to the 

00:19:49.270 --> 00:19:53.890
 heroes of the armed forces of 

00:19:52.540 --> 00:19:56.350
 Colombia 

00:19:53.890 --> 00:19:59.460
 they have never stopped protecting the 

00:19:56.350 --> 00:20:02.980
 Colombian people and they understood very well 

00:19:59.460 --> 00:20:08.790
 that the true victory of all 

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:08.790
 soldier and of all police is peace 

00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:14.930
 and I want to do 

00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:18.800
 a special recognition 

00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:22.130
 all the gratitude of my heart to me 

00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:25.340
 family to my wife and my children without 

00:20:22.130 --> 00:20:29.020
 whose love support this task would have 

00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:29.020
 been much heavier 

00:20:44.540 --> 00:20:48.510
 I share 

00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.030
 and finally this prize with the 

00:20:48.510 --> 00:20:54.260
 international community 

00:20:51.030 --> 00:20:57.600
 that with generous and unanimous enthusiasm 

00:20:54.260 --> 00:21:00.240
 I support the peace process from its 

00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:04.140
 the beginning 

00:21:00.240 --> 00:21:08.419
 and let me take this opportunity 

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:10.730
 to thank very especially 

00:21:08.419 --> 00:21:14.660
 to the Norwegian people 

00:21:10.730 --> 00:21:17.330
 to his government for its peaceful nature and 

00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:19.700
 your spirit of solidarity 

00:21:17.330 --> 00:21:22.820
 It was because of these virtues that they do not see 

00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:24.659
 He entrusted them with the promotion of peace in 

00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:28.190
 world 

00:21:24.659 --> 00:21:30.899
 and I must say that in the case of my country 

00:21:28.190 --> 00:21:33.180
 they fulfilled their work with great 

00:21:30.899 --> 00:21:38.840
 effectiveness 

00:21:33.180 --> 00:21:43.400
 Norway and Cuba in their role as guarantors 

00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:45.320
 chile and venezuela as US escorts 

00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:48.920
 and the European Union with envoys 

00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:52.160
 special all the countries of america 

00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:55.800
 latina and the caribbean 

00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:59.400
 even china and russia 

00:21:55.800 --> 00:22:02.620
 everyone has reasons to participate in the 

00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:05.170
 pride for this achievement 

00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:07.570
 the institute crowd of studies 

00:22:05.170 --> 00:22:12.550
 international peace of the university 

00:22:07.570 --> 00:22:16.630
 de notre damme in the USA concluded after 

00:22:12.550 --> 00:22:19.750
 a detailed study of the 34 agreements 

00:22:16.630 --> 00:22:22.120
 signed in the world in the last three 

00:22:19.750 --> 00:22:25.630
 decades to end conflicts 

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:28.450
 armed that the peace agreement in 

00:22:25.630 --> 00:22:31.340
 Colombia is the most complete and comprehensive 

00:22:28.450 --> 00:22:34.160
 of all 

00:22:31.340 --> 00:22:37.220
 the peace agreement in colombia 'is a 

00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:40.670
 ray of hope in an affected world 

00:22:37.220 --> 00:22:42.410
 by many conflicts and too much 

00:22:40.670 --> 00:22:44.880
 intolerance 

00:22:42.410 --> 00:22:47.670
 It is a demonstration 

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:51.840
 that what at first seems 

00:22:47.670 --> 00:22:54.110
 impossible if you persevere you can 

00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:58.520
 return possible 

00:22:54.110 --> 00:23:00.700
 even in Syria or Yemen or Sudan 

00:22:58.520 --> 00:23:02.809
 from the south 

00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:06.370
 the key 

00:23:02.809 --> 00:23:12.429
 in the words of that great English poet 

00:23:06.370 --> 00:23:15.360
 Tennyson is striving to find 

00:23:12.429 --> 00:23:16.880
 and not give up 

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:19.310
 [Music] 

00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:22.240
 several lessons can be derived from the 

00:23:19.310 --> 00:23:24.820
 peace process in colombia 'I would like 

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:27.340
 share with the world 

00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:31.600
 you have to prepare and advise 

00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:33.730
 duly analyzing what failure in 

00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:37.090
 previous attempts at peace in one's own 

00:23:33.730 --> 00:23:41.420
 country and learning from the successes and 

00:23:37.090 --> 00:23:43.520
 failures of other peace processes 

00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:47.090
 you have to set a negotiating agenda 

00:23:43.520 --> 00:23:49.910
 realistic and concrete solution 

00:23:47.090 --> 00:23:53.020
 matters directly related to 

00:23:49.910 --> 00:23:56.640
 conflict and that does not intend to cover 

00:23:53.020 --> 00:23:59.370
 all the problems of the nation 

00:23:56.640 --> 00:24:02.580
 we must advance the negotiations with 

00:23:59.370 --> 00:24:06.919
 discretion and confidentiality so that 

00:24:02.580 --> 00:24:10.340
 do not become a media circus 

00:24:06.919 --> 00:24:13.730
 sometimes to reach peace is 

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:15.500
 necessary to fight and dialogue at the same 

00:24:13.730 --> 00:24:17.990
 weather 

00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:22.780
 a lesson I learned from another winner 

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:22.780
 of the Nobel Prize isaac Rabbin 

00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:29.990
 you have to be willing to take 

00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:34.070
 difficult decisions audacious many 

00:24:29.990 --> 00:24:37.260
 many times unpopular to achieve 

00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:39.940
 the ultimate goal of peace 

00:24:37.260 --> 00:24:42.399
 this meant in my case 

00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:46.659
 get closer to government of neighboring countries 

00:24:42.399 --> 00:24:50.100
 with whom I had and I still have deep 

00:24:46.659 --> 00:24:50.100
 ideological differences 

00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:57.809
 Regional support is essential for 

00:24:54.510 --> 00:25:00.940
 the political solution of any war 

00:24:57.809 --> 00:25:03.790
 asymmetric nowadays 

00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:07.030
 and today fortunately all the countries of the 

00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:10.090
 region are firm allies in the search 

00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:13.740
 of peace that is the noblest purpose 

00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:13.740
 of any society 

00:25:14.680 --> 00:25:19.720
 we also achieved something very important that 

00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:23.620
 was to agree a model of justice 

00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:28.580
 transitional that allows us to obtain the 

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:31.909
 maximum of justice without sacrificing peace 

00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:34.909
 I have no doubt that this model will be 

00:25:31.909 --> 00:25:38.169
 one of the great legacies of the process 

00:25:34.909 --> 00:25:40.550
 of peace of colombia 

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:44.210
 Ladies and Gentlemen 

00:25:40.550 --> 00:25:45.549
 there is a war - in the world and it is 

00:25:44.210 --> 00:25:49.110
 Colombia 

00:25:45.549 --> 00:25:53.230
 and this is precisely what we celebrate 

00:25:49.110 --> 00:25:55.929
 today in oslo the same city that hosted 

00:25:53.230 --> 00:25:58.600
 the start of the public phase of 

00:25:55.929 --> 00:26:01.810
 talks with the FARC in October 

00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:05.440
 of the year 2012 

00:26:01.810 --> 00:26:10.509
 and I must say that I feel honored 

00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:12.250
 and at the same time humble to join the 

00:26:10.509 --> 00:26:14.620
 line of brave and inspiring 

00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:19.120
 men and women 

00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:22.830
 since 1901 they have received the most 

00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:22.830
 prestigious of the awards 

00:26:23.049 --> 00:26:29.549
 the peace process in colombia 'I say it 

00:26:26.649 --> 00:26:33.330
 with deep gratitude 

00:26:29.549 --> 00:26:36.580
 It is a fortunate synthesis of what 

00:26:33.330 --> 00:26:39.029
 we have learned from them 

00:26:36.580 --> 00:26:44.559
 peace efforts in the Middle East 

00:26:39.029 --> 00:26:48.460
 in Central America in South Africa in Ireland 

00:26:44.559 --> 00:26:51.880
 from the north whose artificers have received 

00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:55.929
 this award showed us the way 

00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:58.659
 to advance in a custom-made process 

00:26:55.929 --> 00:27:01.779
 from Colombia 

00:26:58.659 --> 00:27:05.229
 we also picked up the legacy of jody 

00:27:01.779 --> 00:27:08.580
 Williams and the international campaign for 

00:27:05.229 --> 00:27:13.070
 the prohibition of antipersonnel mines 

00:27:08.580 --> 00:27:15.080
 equally winners of the nobel 

00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:18.289
 after afghanistan colombia holds 

00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:21.799
 the shameful record of being the country with 

00:27:18.289 --> 00:27:24.000
 more mines and more mine victims in 

00:27:21.799 --> 00:27:26.580
 all the world 

00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.220
 our commitment is to have our 

00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:32.180
 mine-free territory for the year 

00:27:29.220 --> 00:27:32.180
 2021 

00:27:32.650 --> 00:27:38.790
 we have also received the support of 

00:27:35.650 --> 00:27:42.160
 other winners like the European Union 

00:27:38.790 --> 00:27:44.680
 president barack obama who have 

00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.200
 committed to their countries to support the 

00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:51.160
 crucial process of implementation of the 

00:27:47.200 --> 00:27:55.050
 peace agreement in colombia ' 

00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:55.050
 and I can not pass up the opportunity 

00:27:55.210 --> 00:28:02.360
 to reiterate today 

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:04.389
 a call that I have made to the world since 

00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:09.139
 the summit of the americas of Cartagena 

00:28:04.389 --> 00:28:11.720
 in the year 2012 and that led to a 

00:28:09.139 --> 00:28:14.750
 special session of the general assembly 

00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:17.529
 of the united nations in April of 

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.529
 present year 

00:28:17.710 --> 00:28:23.440
 I mean the urgent need to 

00:28:20.200 --> 00:28:27.700
 rethink the world war against 

00:28:23.440 --> 00:28:31.059
 drugs a war in which colombia has 

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:33.650
 been the country that more dead and more 

00:28:31.059 --> 00:28:37.520
 sacrifices has put 

00:28:33.650 --> 00:28:40.820
 we have we have the moral authority to 

00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:44.300
 affirm that after decades of struggle 

00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:46.670
 against the drug trade the world has not 

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:49.880
 managed to control this scourge that 

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:54.310
 feeds violence and corruption in 

00:28:49.880 --> 00:28:54.310
 our entire global community 

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:59.870
 the agreement with the FARC includes the 

00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.570
 commitment of this group to break 

00:28:59.870 --> 00:29:07.420
 any link with the business of the 

00:29:02.570 --> 00:29:09.190
 drugs and to help fight it 

00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:13.320
 but drug trafficking is a problem 

00:29:09.190 --> 00:29:18.480
 global and requires a global solution 

00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:22.540
 that starts from an undeniable reality 

00:29:18.480 --> 00:29:26.970
 the war on drugs has not been 

00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.970
 won is not winning 

00:29:27.180 --> 00:29:32.190
 it does not make sense to imprison a peasant 

00:29:29.880 --> 00:29:35.330
 who sows marijuana 

00:29:32.190 --> 00:29:39.090
 when for example today is legal 

00:29:35.330 --> 00:29:41.659
 produce it and consume it in 8 states of 

00:29:39.090 --> 00:29:41.659
 The USA 

00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:48.280
 the way in which the 

00:29:45.070 --> 00:29:52.330
 war against drugs is equal or 

00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:56.410
 even more harmful than all wars 

00:29:52.330 --> 00:30:00.810
 together that today are fought in the world and 

00:29:56.410 --> 00:30:00.810
 it's time to change our strategy 

00:30:13.539 --> 00:30:20.169
 in colombia they have also inspired us 

00:30:16.419 --> 00:30:22.440
 the initiatives of malaga 

00:30:20.169 --> 00:30:25.269
 the youngest recipient of the Nobel prize 

00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:29.710
 we know that only by forming 

00:30:25.269 --> 00:30:32.490
 minds through education we can 

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:34.800
 transform reality 

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:36.770
 we are the result of our 

00:30:34.800 --> 00:30:40.520
 thoughts 

00:30:36.770 --> 00:30:43.299
 thoughts that create our words 

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:46.440
 words that create 

00:30:43.299 --> 00:30:49.200
 our actions 

00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:50.700
 that's why we have to change from 

00:30:49.200 --> 00:30:52.770
 in 

00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.920
 we have to change the culture of 

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:58.680
 violence for a culture of peace and 

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:01.860
 coexistence we have to change the 

00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:05.539
 culture of exclusion by a culture 

00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:09.019
 of inclusion and tolerance 

00:31:05.539 --> 00:31:11.450
 and speaking of coexistence we have also 

00:31:09.019 --> 00:31:15.009
 learned from the former vice president of usa 

00:31:11.450 --> 00:31:18.379
 to golf and the intergovernmental panel 

00:31:15.009 --> 00:31:21.660
 about climate change in its endeavor 

00:31:18.379 --> 00:31:24.840
 for saving the planet 

00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:28.140
 It's good to say that the 

00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:31.830
 end of the conflict in Colombia the country 

00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:33.140
 most biodiverse from around the world by 

00:31:31.830 --> 00:31:36.960
 square kilometer 

00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:39.220
 will bring important dividends 

00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:42.100
 environmental 

00:31:39.220 --> 00:31:43.260
 by replacing illicit crops with 

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:47.200
 legal crops 

00:31:43.260 --> 00:31:50.429
 the deforestation generated to plant 

00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:53.070
 coca will decrease 

00:31:50.429 --> 00:31:56.100
 in addition, millions of 

00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:59.580
 barrels of oil to our rivers and 

00:31:56.100 --> 00:32:02.990
 our seas because of attacks on 

00:31:59.580 --> 00:32:02.990
 the oil infrastructure 

00:32:03.680 --> 00:32:10.640
 in conclusion the peace process of 

00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:13.160
 Colombia that is rewarded today in Oslo is the 

00:32:10.640 --> 00:32:16.160
 synthesis and the result of many 

00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:18.650
 positive efforts that have been made 

00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:21.710
 through history and around the 

00:32:18.650 --> 00:32:26.320
 world and that have been valued and 

00:32:21.710 --> 00:32:26.320
 exalted by this committee of the nobel 

00:32:27.370 --> 00:32:32.890
 Dear friends 

00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:36.780
 in a world where citizens take 

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:40.450
 the most crucial decisions for them 

00:32:36.780 --> 00:32:44.170
 and for their nations pushed by the 

00:32:40.450 --> 00:32:47.530
 fear and despair we have to 

00:32:44.170 --> 00:32:50.430
 make the judgment possible the certainty of 

00:32:47.530 --> 00:32:50.430
 the hope 

00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:55.710
 in a world where wars and 

00:32:52.590 --> 00:32:57.230
 conflicts are fueled by hatred and 

00:32:55.710 --> 00:32:59.910
 the prejudices 

00:32:57.230 --> 00:33:03.410
 we have to find the path of 

00:32:59.910 --> 00:33:03.410
 forgiveness and reconciliation 

00:33:04.559 --> 00:33:11.399
 in a world in which the 

00:33:07.409 --> 00:33:14.460
 borders to immigrants is attacked 

00:33:11.399 --> 00:33:17.669
 minorities and excludes the 

00:33:14.460 --> 00:33:21.389
 different we have to be able to 

00:33:17.669 --> 00:33:24.990
 live with diversity and appreciate the 

00:33:21.389 --> 00:33:27.100
 way it enriches our 

00:33:24.990 --> 00:33:29.549
 societies 

00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.549
 to the 

00:33:40.179 --> 00:33:47.559
 at the end of the day we are all beings 

00:33:45.159 --> 00:33:51.639
 humans 

00:33:47.559 --> 00:33:54.240
 for whom we are believers we are all 

00:33:51.639 --> 00:33:57.840
 Children of God 

00:33:54.240 --> 00:34:02.400
 we are part of this magnificent adventure 

00:33:57.840 --> 00:34:04.039
 what it means to be alive and populate this 

00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:07.530
 planet 

00:34:04.039 --> 00:34:10.620
 nothing differentiates us in the essence 

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:14.070
 neither the color of the skin nor the creeds 

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:18.260
 religious nor political ideologies 

00:34:14.070 --> 00:34:22.169
 nor are sexual preferences just 

00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:23.659
 facets of the rich diversity of being 

00:34:22.169 --> 00:34:27.289
 human 

00:34:23.659 --> 00:34:28.929
 awaken the creative capacity for 

00:34:27.289 --> 00:34:31.750
 good 

00:34:28.929 --> 00:34:34.810
 for the construction of peace that 

00:34:31.750 --> 00:34:36.690
 resides in each soul 

00:34:34.810 --> 00:34:42.030
 in the end 

00:34:36.690 --> 00:34:44.820
 we are one people and one race 

00:34:42.030 --> 00:34:48.980
 of all the colors of all the 

00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:53.510
 beliefs of all preferences 

00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:59.170
 our town is called the world and 

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:59.170
 our race is called humanity 

00:35:23.520 --> 00:35:28.200
 if we understand this 

00:35:26.310 --> 00:35:31.430
 if we make it part of our 

00:35:28.200 --> 00:35:35.160
 individual and collective conscience 

00:35:31.430 --> 00:35:40.160
 then we can cut the root itself 

00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:40.160
 of conflicts and wars 

00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:48.290
 in 1982 

00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:49.880
 34 years ago the efforts began 

00:35:48.290 --> 00:35:52.960
 to achieve the peace of colombia 

00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:52.960
 through dialogue 

00:35:53.329 --> 00:35:58.750
 that same year 

00:35:55.740 --> 00:36:01.910
 in stockholm 

00:35:58.750 --> 00:36:05.539
 Gabriel Garcia Marquez 

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:08.420
 who was my ally in the search for 

00:36:05.539 --> 00:36:11.450
 peace together with the former president felipe 

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:15.380
 gonzález that today accompanies us 

00:36:11.450 --> 00:36:17.100
 he received the Nobel prize for literature and 

00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:21.330
 I speak 

00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:22.970
 spoke of a new and devastating utopia 

00:36:21.330 --> 00:36:26.510
 of the life 

00:36:22.970 --> 00:36:28.300
 where the strains sentenced to 100 years 

00:36:26.510 --> 00:36:32.890
 of loneliness 

00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:36.020
 have finally and forever a 

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:38.920
 second opportunity 

00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:38.920
 on earth 

00:36:38.950 --> 00:36:43.240
 today colombia 

00:36:41.070 --> 00:36:46.240
 my beloved country 

00:36:43.240 --> 00:36:48.210
 is enjoying this second 

00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.920
 opportunity 

00:36:48.210 --> 00:36:54.880
 and I thank you 

00:36:50.920 --> 00:36:56.750
 to the Norwegian Nobel committee because in 

00:36:54.880 --> 00:37:01.780
 This time 

00:36:56.750 --> 00:37:07.050
 they not only awarded an effort for peace 

00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:12.120
 you helped make it possible 

00:37:07.050 --> 00:37:16.440
 the sun of peace shines at last in the 

00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:19.580
 sky of colombia and that its light illuminate 

00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:37.179
 to the whole world thank you very much 

00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:37.179
 [Applause]
