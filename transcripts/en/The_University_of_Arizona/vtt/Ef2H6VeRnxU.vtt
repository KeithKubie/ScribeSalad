00:00:02.060 --> 00:00:04.062
It really was an
extremely chaotic scene.

00:00:04.062 --> 00:00:06.270
We could smell the clutches
of semis coming up on us,

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:08.109
we could smell their
brakes getting on them.

00:00:08.109 --> 00:00:11.480
We're walking out, I could
hear somebody yelling for help.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:16.129
So, I sprint up there, found
the subject on the ground.

00:00:16.129 --> 00:00:18.050
And there was a lot of blood.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.850
Even now, thinking
back on it, how much

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:21.095
blood was on the ground.

00:00:21.095 --> 00:00:23.063
And I knew I would
probably need a tourniquet.

00:00:23.063 --> 00:00:27.180
So, grabbed that, ran back,
took the tourniquet out.

00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:29.030
So I set it on, placed it.

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:32.090
I was fresh, I moved right
in, got it cinched tight.

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.450
And it was really amazing to
see the patient's reaction.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.340
Bleeding control is
one of the easiest

00:00:37.340 --> 00:00:38.960
things that we can
teach and probably

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.680
one of the most useful.

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.420
So this Stop the Bleed campaign
is being pushed nationally

00:00:44.420 --> 00:00:48.550
right now because it's in the
forefront of medical education.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.150
And now, it's carried on by the
American College of Surgeons

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:58.220
as a nationwide initiative to
train our non-medical civilians

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.120
on these very simple means
of controlling hemorrhage.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.400
So you can have something
from a basic laceration

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.610
that your first step would
be to apply pressure.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:11.390
If it's not compressible
and still bleeding,

00:01:11.390 --> 00:01:14.210
pack it with dressings, if
you happen to have them.

00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:18.020
If you don't, shirts,
anything that's cloth.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:20.270
If the bleeding is not
stopped with that pressure

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:23.000
and with that dressing, then
you can apply a tourniquet.

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:24.740
And those are so
easy to use, it just

00:01:24.740 --> 00:01:26.960
takes that five
minutes of education

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.425
to be able to understand it.

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:32.000
I almost gave up.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.006
I was like, somebody to
my daughter I love her.

00:01:35.006 --> 00:01:38.690
That's when I seen
the Border Patrol.

00:01:38.690 --> 00:01:39.374
I hope the best.

00:01:39.374 --> 00:01:40.790
I hope the best
for you guys, too.

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:41.873
Thank you guys for being--

00:01:41.873 --> 00:01:42.800
Oh, absolutely.

00:01:42.800 --> 00:01:45.175
I will always have a tourniquet
with me from here on out.

00:01:45.175 --> 00:01:49.600
To see how it worked,
I'm a believer.
