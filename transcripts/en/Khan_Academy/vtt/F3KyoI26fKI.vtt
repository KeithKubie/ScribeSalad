00:00:00.615 --> 00:00:02.679
- [Instructor] Let's
say that X is a function

00:00:02.679 --> 00:00:06.940
of the parameter T and
it's equal to cosine of T

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:10.273
and Y is also defined as a function of T

00:00:12.321 --> 00:00:15.217
and it's equal to sin of T

00:00:15.217 --> 00:00:17.136
and we wanna find the arc length

00:00:17.136 --> 00:00:18.943
of the curve traced out,

00:00:18.943 --> 00:00:22.110
so length of curve

00:00:24.308 --> 00:00:28.319
from T is equal to zero

00:00:28.319 --> 00:00:31.532
to T is equal to pi over two.

00:00:31.532 --> 00:00:34.001
So, pause this video and
see if you can work that out

00:00:34.001 --> 00:00:37.418
based on formulas that we
have seen in other videos.

00:00:37.418 --> 00:00:39.617
Alright, so first, I'm
gonna look at the formula

00:00:39.617 --> 00:00:41.018
and then we're gonna visualize it

00:00:41.018 --> 00:00:43.698
and appreciate why what
we got from the formula

00:00:43.698 --> 00:00:45.111
actually makes sense.

00:00:45.111 --> 00:00:47.521
So, the formula tells us that arc length

00:00:47.521 --> 00:00:49.529
of a parametric curve,

00:00:49.529 --> 00:00:52.446
arc length is equal to the integral

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:56.403
from our starting point of our parameter,

00:00:56.403 --> 00:00:59.201
T equals A to our ending
point of our parameter,

00:00:59.201 --> 00:01:03.118
T equals B of the square
root of the derivative

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:07.110
of X with respect to T squared

00:01:08.039 --> 00:01:12.206
plus the derivative of Y with
respect to T squared DT, DT.

00:01:15.882 --> 00:01:18.331
This could also be
rewritten as this is equal

00:01:18.331 --> 00:01:21.147
to the integral from A to B

00:01:21.147 --> 00:01:24.980
of the square root of DX/DT squared

00:01:27.429 --> 00:01:30.096
plus DY/DT squared DT

00:01:32.854 --> 00:01:35.641
but either way we can now
apply it in this context.

00:01:35.641 --> 00:01:37.385
What is DX/DT?

00:01:37.385 --> 00:01:41.552
So, DX/DT is equal to
the derivative of cosine

00:01:43.772 --> 00:01:46.689
of T is equal to negative sin of T,

00:01:47.969 --> 00:01:49.542
negative sin of T

00:01:49.542 --> 00:01:51.740
and what is DY/DT?

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.337
The derivative of Y with respect to T.

00:01:54.337 --> 00:01:57.971
The derivative of sin of T
is cosine of T, cosine of T.

00:01:57.971 --> 00:02:01.040
So, our arc length up
here is going to be equal

00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:04.496
to the integral from T is equal to zero

00:02:04.496 --> 00:02:07.005
to pi over two, that's what we care about,

00:02:07.005 --> 00:02:08.033
our parameter's going from zero

00:02:08.033 --> 00:02:10.704
to pi over two of the square root

00:02:10.704 --> 00:02:14.503
of the derivative of X
with respect to T squared.

00:02:14.503 --> 00:02:17.322
That's a negative sin of T squared,

00:02:17.322 --> 00:02:19.434
well, if you square it the
negative's gonna go away,

00:02:19.434 --> 00:02:21.093
we're gonna have negative
sin times negative sin

00:02:21.093 --> 00:02:23.068
is positive sin squared,

00:02:23.068 --> 00:02:26.485
so I could write this as sin squared of T

00:02:27.874 --> 00:02:30.412
and then DY/DT squared,

00:02:30.412 --> 00:02:32.277
that's just cosine squared T,

00:02:32.277 --> 00:02:34.598
plus cosine squared T

00:02:34.598 --> 00:02:37.434
and then we have our DT out here.

00:02:37.434 --> 00:02:41.049
Now lucky for us, sin
squared plus cosine squared

00:02:41.049 --> 00:02:45.018
of some variable is always
going to be equal to one.

00:02:45.018 --> 00:02:49.062
So, that's one of our most
basic trig identities,

00:02:49.062 --> 00:02:51.236
comes straight out of the
unit circle definition

00:02:51.236 --> 00:02:52.893
of sin and cosine

00:02:52.893 --> 00:02:54.843
and so, we have the square root of one,

00:02:54.843 --> 00:02:55.787
the principle root of one

00:02:55.787 --> 00:02:56.976
which is just going to be one,

00:02:56.976 --> 00:02:59.692
so everything here has just simplified

00:02:59.692 --> 00:03:03.359
to the integral from
zero to pi over two DT.

00:03:04.376 --> 00:03:06.755
Well, this is going to be equal to,

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:08.320
so you could view it, this is a one here,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.646
the antiderivative of
one with respect to T

00:03:10.646 --> 00:03:12.139
is just gonna be T

00:03:12.139 --> 00:03:16.013
and we're gonna evaluate
that from pi over two.

00:03:16.013 --> 00:03:17.463
We're gonna evaluate that at pi over two

00:03:17.463 --> 00:03:18.616
and then subtract.

00:03:18.616 --> 00:03:19.730
It evaluated at zero,

00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:23.754
so this is gonna be equal to pi over two

00:03:23.754 --> 00:03:25.437
minus zero,

00:03:25.437 --> 00:03:28.098
that's going to be equal to pi over two.

00:03:28.098 --> 00:03:32.265
Now let's think about why
that actually does make sense.

00:03:33.447 --> 00:03:35.280
Let's plot this curve.

00:03:36.609 --> 00:03:40.192
So, that is my Y axis
and this is my X axis

00:03:42.721 --> 00:03:43.995
right over here.

00:03:43.995 --> 00:03:45.995
When T is equal to zero,

00:03:47.536 --> 00:03:50.342
you have X of zero is cosine of zero,

00:03:50.342 --> 00:03:52.148
X is equal to one,

00:03:52.148 --> 00:03:53.579
X is equal to one,

00:03:53.579 --> 00:03:56.018
and Y, sin of zero is just zero,

00:03:56.018 --> 00:03:57.048
so Y is equal to zero,

00:03:57.048 --> 00:03:58.968
so we're at this point right here

00:03:58.968 --> 00:04:00.718
at T is equal to zero

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.889
and then as T increases up to pi over two,

00:04:04.889 --> 00:04:07.518
we trace out the top right corner

00:04:07.518 --> 00:04:09.462
of the unit circle

00:04:09.462 --> 00:04:10.675
and we end up right over here

00:04:10.675 --> 00:04:13.258
when T is equal to pi over two.

00:04:14.273 --> 00:04:15.966
You could view T in this case

00:04:15.966 --> 00:04:19.208
as some type of an angle in radians.

00:04:19.208 --> 00:04:22.397
And so, the arc length
is really just the length

00:04:22.397 --> 00:04:25.034
of quarter of a quarter of a unit circle.

00:04:25.034 --> 00:04:26.261
Well, we know what the circumference

00:04:26.261 --> 00:04:28.839
of a circle is, it is two pi R.

00:04:28.839 --> 00:04:31.860
In the unit circle
case, the radius is one,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:34.678
so the circumference of the
entire circle is two pie.

00:04:34.678 --> 00:04:38.700
One fourth of that is
going to be pi over two.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:40.798
So, it's nice when we this fancy thing

00:04:40.798 --> 00:04:42.856
that we feel good about it in calculus

00:04:42.856 --> 00:04:47.023
is consistent with what we
first learned in basic geometry.
