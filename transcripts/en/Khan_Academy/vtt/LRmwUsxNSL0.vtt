00:00:00.504 --> 00:00:01.920
What I want to do
in this video is

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:04.520
reconcile the more
traditional Drake equation

00:00:04.520 --> 00:00:07.710
with the stuff that we derived,
or that we came up with.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.740
We kind of thought through it
in the last several videos.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:13.630
So the more known
Drake equation is this.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:17.230
The number of detectable
civilizations in the galaxy

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.700
is equal to-- and
they'll have this.

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:23.580
And this is not the number
of stars in the galaxy.

00:00:23.580 --> 00:00:26.700
This is the average
rate of star formation

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.060
per year in the galaxy.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:32.140
So star-- so let
me write this down.

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:38.410
Average rate of star
formation, which

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.530
seems kind of
unintuitive, and frankly,

00:00:41.530 --> 00:00:43.915
it is, but hopefully we'll
reconcile to show you

00:00:43.915 --> 00:00:45.540
that this, and what
we're going to show

00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:46.998
with the traditional
Drake equation

00:00:46.998 --> 00:00:48.386
are actually the same thing.

00:00:48.386 --> 00:00:50.260
So that's the average
rate of star formation.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:51.385
So I don't know what it is.

00:00:51.385 --> 00:00:53.940
Maybe it's 10 stars a year,
or something on that order.

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:56.650
And then the rest of it
looks pretty similar.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.450
So times the fraction of
stars that have planets.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:04.500
So this product would
give you the average stars

00:01:04.500 --> 00:01:06.820
with planet formations per year.

00:01:06.820 --> 00:01:10.180
You multiply that times
the average number

00:01:10.180 --> 00:01:14.970
of planets capable
of sustaining life

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.370
for a star that has planets,
for a solar system that

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:19.579
has planets.

00:01:19.579 --> 00:01:21.120
So essentially, if
you multiply this,

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:24.020
this is the average
new planets per year

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:27.810
in our galaxy capable
of sustaining life.

00:01:27.810 --> 00:01:31.390
You multiply that
times this, which

00:01:31.390 --> 00:01:33.534
is the same exact fraction.

00:01:33.534 --> 00:01:34.950
The fraction of
those planets that

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:38.620
are capable of sustaining
life, that actually, this

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.630
is capable of sustaining
life, now we're

00:01:40.630 --> 00:01:44.030
saying that the fraction that
actually do develop life.

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:47.000
And then of the life, we
care about the fraction

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.880
that actually does
become intelligent.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:51.450
And of the fraction
that actually

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:56.470
does become intelligent,
we care about the fraction

00:01:56.470 --> 00:01:58.940
that eventually
becomes detectable.

00:01:58.940 --> 00:02:00.710
That can actually communicate.

00:02:00.710 --> 00:02:02.860
And then in the
traditional Drake equation,

00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:06.120
we multiply that times
this L over here.

00:02:06.120 --> 00:02:09.440
Times the detectable
life of the civilization.

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:11.880
So how long is that
civilization detectable?

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:14.420
Are they releasing radio
waves, or something like it

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.181
that a civilization
like ours can detect?

00:02:17.181 --> 00:02:18.930
Maybe there are other
ways to communicate,

00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:20.060
and we're just not
advanced enough.

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:21.650
Maybe in a few
years, we'll discover

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:23.524
in a few decades, or a
few hundreds of years,

00:02:23.524 --> 00:02:26.210
we'll discover that all the
other advanced civilizations

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:27.990
are using a much more
sophisticated way

00:02:27.990 --> 00:02:30.590
of communicating that doesn't
involve electromagnetic waves.

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:31.560
Who knows?

00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.310
But this is what we're
thinking right now.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:34.768
But anyway, the
whole point here is

00:02:34.768 --> 00:02:37.650
to reconcile this thing which
is less intuitive-- for me

00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:39.140
at least-- than with this thing.

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:41.098
Because I started up here
with the total number

00:02:41.098 --> 00:02:42.339
of stars in the galaxy.

00:02:42.339 --> 00:02:43.880
The traditional
Drake equation starts

00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:47.036
with the average rate
of star formation.

00:02:47.036 --> 00:02:49.660
So it's like, well, how does the
average rate of star formation

00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:52.350
gel with the total
number of stars,

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:54.650
or civilizations that
are now detectable?

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.270
What I want to do is diagram
that out a little bit,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:59.140
and I'm going to make
a few assumptions.

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.850
I'm going to assume that this
is kind of constant, that we're

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.350
in a steady state.

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:06.329
So this is constant, and
we are in a steady state.

00:03:06.329 --> 00:03:07.870
The reality is that
what would matter

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.910
is the rate of star
formation maybe 4, 5,

00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.370
6 billion years
ago, I don't know

00:03:13.370 --> 00:03:16.270
how long it has to be
ago, so that now it

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.850
starts to become realistic
for real intelligence

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.010
and real detectable
intelligence to exist.

00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:22.830
But let's just assume
that this number

00:03:22.830 --> 00:03:25.052
is constant for most of
the life of the galaxy.

00:03:25.052 --> 00:03:27.510
Obviously we're making all
sorts of crazy assumptions here,

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.530
so why not make another one?

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:31.850
But what I want you
to show is that this

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:36.800
is equivalent to the number
of stars in the galaxy divided

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:43.260
by the average life of a
star, or the average life

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.200
of a solar system.

00:03:44.200 --> 00:03:47.160
And if n divided
by this t sub s,

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.250
if that's the same
thing as our star, then

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.640
essentially we have
the same formulas.

00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.160
And to see that they're
the same, imagine this.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.310
Imagine this.

00:03:57.310 --> 00:04:02.120
That this year, so this is
this year, so this is-- well,

00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:04.000
let me say this year.

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.540
This year.

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:07.670
Let's say that we have our star.

00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:09.700
Let's say that
this number is 10.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.880
We have 10 new
stars in the galaxy.

00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.149
So this is-- I'll
just say it's 10.

00:04:16.149 --> 00:04:19.390
So our star is equal to 10.

00:04:19.390 --> 00:04:20.959
So this height over here is 10.

00:04:20.959 --> 00:04:22.220
That's what I'm depicting.

00:04:22.220 --> 00:04:23.595
So if I were to
slide it, I could

00:04:23.595 --> 00:04:25.720
show that this is 10
units high, or whatever.

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.660
And then last year, there was
also 10, so on and so forth.

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:33.740
Now, let's go to
whatever-- let's

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.860
say that this number, this
number right over here

00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:36.830
is 10 billion years.

00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:39.220
The average star life
is 10 billion years.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:44.430
So let's go back 10 billion
years into the past.

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:50.720
So the average life of a star
is equal to 10 billion years.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.210
And we're assuming
that this is constant.

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:56.360
So 10 billion years
ago this year,

00:04:56.360 --> 00:05:01.990
there were also 10
new stars came about.

00:05:01.990 --> 00:05:07.310
And every year in between
you had 10 stars come about.

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:12.550
Now, how many total stars
would there be in our galaxy?

00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:15.560
Well, any star that came about--
so we could go beyond that.

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:19.190
We could go to stars that were
born more than 10 billion years

00:05:19.190 --> 00:05:21.740
ago, more than this
t sub s years ago.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:25.480
So you could have a
star that was born 10

00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:27.590
billion and 1 years
ago, on average.

00:05:27.590 --> 00:05:29.220
We're talking about
on averages here.

00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:31.770
On average, that star
will not exist anymore,

00:05:31.770 --> 00:05:34.580
so that star is
not in existence.

00:05:34.580 --> 00:05:37.520
The stars that are in existence,
once again, on average,

00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:40.990
are the ones that were born 10
billion years ago, all the way

00:05:40.990 --> 00:05:43.090
to the ones that
were born this year.

00:05:43.090 --> 00:05:46.200
So you have 10 billion
years of star birth,

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.760
the ones that are still around.

00:05:47.760 --> 00:05:50.040
Each year there's
10 of those years,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:54.430
so the total number
of stars should

00:05:54.430 --> 00:05:57.240
be equal to the
number of stars that

00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:00.300
are born each year-- assuming
that that is constant--

00:06:00.300 --> 00:06:05.530
times the average
lifespan of the stars.

00:06:05.530 --> 00:06:10.160
Times the average
lifespan of the stars.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:15.910
And once again, this works
because the stars that

00:06:15.910 --> 00:06:19.570
were born before this
lifespan don't exist anymore.

00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.020
They've died out, on average.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:23.590
We care about kind of
this area right over here.

00:06:23.590 --> 00:06:26.237
10 stars per year
times 10 billion years.

00:06:26.237 --> 00:06:28.070
And now if you manipulate
this a little bit,

00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:29.945
you'll see that we'll
get the result we want.

00:06:29.945 --> 00:06:30.880
Let's solve for r.

00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:33.980
So we could just divide
both sides by this t.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:38.670
So you get n star, so the number
of stars in our galaxy now,

00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:40.320
making a bunch of
assumptions, divided

00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:43.360
by the average life
of the stars is

00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:49.930
equal to the average number
of new stars per year.

00:06:49.930 --> 00:06:53.240
Is equal to the average
number of new stars per year,

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:54.250
and we get our result.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:07:00.590
If you replace this with the
total number of stars divided

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:05.900
by t, you get the exact same
result that we had before.

00:07:05.900 --> 00:07:07.260
You just change the order a bit.

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:10.900
We can take this divided
by t, put it under this n,

00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.880
take it out up here, and then
you get the exact same thing.

00:07:13.880 --> 00:07:17.580
So hopefully that reconciles
it a little bit for you.
