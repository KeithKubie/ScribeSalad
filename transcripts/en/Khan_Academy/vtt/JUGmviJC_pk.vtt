00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.270
Rewrite the following
expression as the product

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:06.380
of positive exponents, and
then evaluate the expression

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.710
when x is equal to 2.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.030
So they gave us x to
the negative 3 times

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.090
5 to the negative
2 times x squared.

00:00:13.090 --> 00:00:14.660
So the main thing
to realize here

00:00:14.660 --> 00:00:19.460
is if I have something
to a negative exponent,

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:21.660
this is the exact
same thing as 1

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:25.100
over that same base to
the positive version

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:25.810
of the exponent.

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:28.910
So x to the negative a is
equal to 1 over x to the a.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:32.060
So using this knowledge, let's
just apply it right over here.

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:36.410
So x to the negative 3
power, we can rewrite as 1

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.130
over x to the third power.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:41.980
And then 5 to the
negative 2, we can

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:45.650
rewrite as 1 over 5 squared.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:50.280
And then finally, we
have times x squared.

00:00:50.280 --> 00:00:51.670
And so we can multiply this out.

00:00:51.670 --> 00:00:53.390
In the numerator, we
have 1 times 1 times

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:56.580
x squared, which is
just equal to x squared.

00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.060
In the denominator, we have x
to the third times 5 squared.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:02.350
5 squared is 25.

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:05.390
And here, you could say
implicitly there is a 1.

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:07.360
This is the same thing
as x squared over 1.

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:11.130
So in the denominator, we
have 25 times x to the third.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:15.810
So this is going to be
25 times x to the third.

00:01:15.810 --> 00:01:17.524
And then we can
simplify this even more

00:01:17.524 --> 00:01:19.440
because both the numerator
and the denominator

00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.690
is divisible by x squared.

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:24.860
x squared divided
by x squared is 1.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.000
x to the third
divided by x squared

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:29.660
is just going to be equal to x.

00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:31.610
And you could use other
exponent properties.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:33.630
You could say x squared
over x to the third

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.070
is the same thing as x to
the 2 minus 3 power, which

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:38.950
is x to the negative 1 power.

00:01:38.950 --> 00:01:40.800
But x to the negative
1 power, we know

00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.240
is the same thing as 1/x.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.390
Any way you do it, as long as
you do it in a reasonable way,

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:49.290
you should get the same result.

00:01:49.290 --> 00:01:50.920
So when we simplify
it, we get 1/25x.

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.980
Now, they want us to evaluate
when x is equal to 2.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:04.290
So if x is equal to 2,
we get 1 over 25 times 2,

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:06.840
which is equal to 1/50.

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.180
And we are done.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.792
We rewrote the expression as a
product of positive exponents.

00:02:11.792 --> 00:02:12.750
That's right over here.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:14.640
We made all the
exponents positive.

00:02:14.640 --> 00:02:17.690
And then we evaluated,
and we got 1/50.
