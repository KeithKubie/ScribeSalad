00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:03.060
Let's do a problem on
exponential growth.

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:06.150
And if you think about it, what
we're going to do here with a

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:09.820
bacteria, it's no different
than what we did with compound

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:16.190
interest when we learned about
interest and the number e.

00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:18.340
Because if you think about it--
well, I'll draw the analogy

00:00:18.340 --> 00:00:19.680
as we do this problem.

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.740
Anyway, this is a compound
growth problem, or an

00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:24.240
exponential growth problem.

00:00:24.240 --> 00:00:27.300
And it says: a bacteria culture
initially contains 100

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.010
cells and grows at a rate
proportional to its size.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:34.770
After an hour, the population
has increased to 420.

00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:37.070
So this first says find an
expression for the number

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:38.490
of bacteria after t hours.

00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:40.910
So in general, anything that--
When you're dealing with

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.140
exponential growth or
exponential decay.

00:00:43.140 --> 00:00:46.130
Or continuously compounding
growth or continuously

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:49.730
compounding decay, though
you'll very seldom

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.480
hear that term.

00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.440
The amount of whatever you have
as a function of time will

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.690
be this type of equation.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:00:58.780
I'll say bacteria as
a function of time.

00:00:58.780 --> 00:00:59.940
So I'll say b of t.

00:00:59.940 --> 00:01:02.310
And I'll do it here.

00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:06.180
So b of-- Well, let me
do it here. b of t.

00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:10.440
Bacteria as a function of time
is going to be equal to the

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:13.260
initial bacteria, or the
initial of whatever we have for

00:01:13.260 --> 00:01:15.080
doing compound interest is
the amount we start

00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:20.980
with, e to the kt.

00:01:20.980 --> 00:01:23.370
Where k is kind of our
compounding rate.

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.790
And so in general, if you
have this I naught, the

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:28.400
initial amount you have.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.180
And that makes sense, right?

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:31.960
Because if t equals 0, this
whole expression is 1.

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:35.490
So b of 0 should
just be I naught.

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:37.790
So if you know what you start
with, and then you have another

00:01:37.790 --> 00:01:39.120
point, you can solve for k.

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.320
And then you have
an expression.

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:42.100
You have the first
thing they want.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.060
Find an expression for the
number bacteria after t hours.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:48.750
So my question to you is, first
of all, what is I sub zero?

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:53.030
What is your initial number
of bacterial cells?

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:54.260
Well they tell us.

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:55.430
They tell us right here.

00:01:55.430 --> 00:01:58.340
The bacteria culture initially
contains 100 cells.

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:07.980
So we know that b of 0 when
time equals 0 or 0 hours, that

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:12.620
is equal to 100 where the
unit is cells, right?

00:02:12.620 --> 00:02:16.320
And so, if we substitute
here t equals 0, this is 1.

00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:19.280
So we know that I naught
is equal to 100.

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:20.370
Let me do that actually.

00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:25.040
So b of 0 is also equal-- if we
look at it there --I naught

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.730
times e to the what? k times 0
times e to the zero is

00:02:28.730 --> 00:02:29.960
equal to I naught.

00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:33.740
So this tells us that the
bacteria at time 0 is 100.

00:02:33.740 --> 00:02:36.010
And then when we substitute
here, is that the bacteria

00:02:36.010 --> 00:02:37.140
times 0 is equal to I naught.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:39.080
So I naught must equal 100.

00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:39.410
OK.

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:41.460
So we're making some progress.

00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:47.070
So we know that the bacteria
as a function of time is

00:02:47.070 --> 00:02:54.020
equal to I naught, 100,
times e to the kt.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:57.800
Now, if we just knew k, then we
would have done this part A,

00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:00.020
find an expression for the
number bacteria after t hours.

00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:02.860
Well how can we figure out k?

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.900
Well they give us
another data point.

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:08.810
After an hour, the population
has increased to 420.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:11.710
So that tells us-- Let me--

00:03:11.710 --> 00:03:26.810
[SIDE COMMENTS]

00:03:26.810 --> 00:03:28.570
Anyway, so what was I doing?

00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:28.800
Oh.

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:34.550
So this tells us, after
an hour the population

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:37.190
has increased to 420.

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.070
So that tells us
that b of 1, right?

00:03:42.070 --> 00:03:44.710
After 1 hour, the population
has increased to 420.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.090
So b of 1 is equal to 420.

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:52.990
Which is also equal to--
If we put 1 here, that is

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:58.080
equal to 100 e to the kt.

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:01.110
Well what's t at b of 1?

00:04:01.110 --> 00:04:01.940
t is 1.

00:04:01.940 --> 00:04:03.750
So e to the k, right?

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:07.200
So 420 is equal to
100 e to the k.

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.690
And now we can solve for k.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:09.490
And let's see what we get.

00:04:09.490 --> 00:04:12.020
So we divide both sides by 100.

00:04:12.020 --> 00:04:12.720
You get 4.2.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.350
Let me put e to the
k on this side.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:19.800
e to the k is equal to 4.2.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.670
To solve for k, we take the
natural log of both sides.

00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:31.000
And we get k is equal to the
natural log of 4.2, which is

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.440
going to be some
bizarre number.

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:36.380
And we can-- We'll figure that
out later with a calculator.

00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:39.050
So there we figured out-- Using
the initial condition here,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:40.110
we figured out I naught.

00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:43.240
And then using this extra
data point, we solved for k.

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:48.520
And we got k is equal to the
ln of the natural log of 4.2.

00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:51.390
So what does that leave us?

00:04:51.390 --> 00:04:53.580
So now we know the equation.

00:04:53.580 --> 00:04:56.310
We know k and we know I naught,
so we know that the equation

00:04:56.310 --> 00:05:04.360
is-- So part A, the equation is
b of t, bacteria as a function

00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:07.610
of time is equal to the initial
number of bacteria, 100

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:10.060
cells, e to the kt.

00:05:10.060 --> 00:05:17.770
And k is ln of 4.2.

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:19.766
That says 4.2.

00:05:19.766 --> 00:05:23.040
And all of that times t.

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:23.950
So that's our function.

00:05:23.950 --> 00:05:25.860
I know you can't read that,
but we'll use it again.

00:05:25.860 --> 00:05:27.820
So it should make
a little sense.

00:05:27.820 --> 00:05:33.640
So then they say find-- this
is part B --find the number

00:05:33.640 --> 00:05:36.260
of bacteria after 3 hours.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:37.500
So that's pretty
straight forward.

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:39.100
We have our function now.

00:05:39.100 --> 00:05:40.620
That at any time t, we
can tell you how many

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:41.370
bacteria there are.

00:05:41.370 --> 00:05:45.970
So let's figure out the number
of bacteria after 3 hours.

00:05:45.970 --> 00:06:04.490
So b of 3 is equal to 100 times
e to the ln of 4.2 times 3.

00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:06.910
And that number we
could calculate if you

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:07.780
have a calculator.

00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:11.240
e to the ln of-- Let's see.

00:06:11.240 --> 00:06:12.570
That's essentially-- Well
what's this going to be?

00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:13.380
This is the same thing.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:15.010
We can actually figure
this out analytically.

00:06:15.010 --> 00:06:22.970
That equals 100 e to the
natural log oh 4.2.

00:06:22.970 --> 00:06:26.920
If you have two things in an
exponent multiplied, that's the

00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:28.770
same thing as taking that and
then raising it to the

00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.550
third power, right?

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:31.273
If we were simplifying, we'd
say oh that's the same thing

00:06:31.273 --> 00:06:32.980
as just multiplying
that times this.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:35.330
What's e to the ln of 4.2?

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:37.730
Well it's 4.2, right?

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.240
Because natural log says well,
what exponent do I have

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.850
to raise e to to get 4.2?

00:06:43.850 --> 00:06:46.720
So if I raise e to that
exponent, I get 4.2.

00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.600
So that equals-- I didn't even
have to use a calculator, look

00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:54.330
at that --4.2 to
the third power.

00:06:54.330 --> 00:06:55.400
And I don't know what that is.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.310
That's going to be probably
70 something and so

00:06:58.310 --> 00:06:59.360
we'll do that later.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:00.170
But that's part B.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.820
That's just plugging
into your calculator.

00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.550
That's part B.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:07.760
Now what are they asking?

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:13.800
Find the rate of
growth after 3 hours.

00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:16.370
Let me do that in
a special color.

00:07:16.370 --> 00:07:19.140
So what are they asking us for?

00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.200
Well they're essentially asking
us what is the slope of this

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.730
function after 3 hours?

00:07:25.730 --> 00:07:28.660
Or another way you could view
it is what is the derivative

00:07:28.660 --> 00:07:31.080
at time is equal to 3?

00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:31.850
Let's do that.

00:07:31.850 --> 00:07:36.660
Let me erase all this
other stuff I have.

00:07:36.660 --> 00:07:38.440
I think we can erase all of
this because we've written

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:42.080
down our equation here.

00:07:42.080 --> 00:07:43.380
We can erase that.

00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:45.970
Actually we could even erase
all of this because we've

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:46.960
just answered that.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.200
That's just plugging into a
calculator at this point.

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.400
Just want to keep our
original equation.

00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:54.380
So let's do part C.

00:07:54.380 --> 00:07:56.380
Part C, find the rate of
growth after 3 hours.

00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:59.750
So we just have to take the
derivative of the bacteria

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:01.230
function with respect to time.

00:08:01.230 --> 00:08:03.060
So let's do that.

00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:06.700
So b prime of t.

00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:09.090
It equals what?

00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:12.160
So what's the derivative of--
Let's just do the chain rule.

00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:15.450
What's the derivative of-- so
we can have 100 constant out

00:08:15.450 --> 00:08:19.720
there times the derivative
of this inside function.

00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:21.446
Well, that's just a
constant times t, so

00:08:21.446 --> 00:08:22.450
it's just a constant.

00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:29.053
So times ln of 4.2 times
the derivative of e

00:08:29.053 --> 00:08:29.860
to the whole thing.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.280
Well, the derivative of e
to the x is e to the x.

00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:34.620
So the chain rule tells us
it's just the derivative

00:08:34.620 --> 00:08:36.860
of this whole expression.

00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:44.570
So times e to the ln 4.2t.

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:51.500
So that's the derivative
at any time t.

00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:53.390
And then they want to know
what the rate of growth

00:08:53.390 --> 00:08:55.460
is after 3 hours.

00:08:55.460 --> 00:09:06.140
So b prime of 3 is equal
to 100 ln of 4.2.

00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:11.500
All of that times-- Well,
e to the-- As we just

00:09:11.500 --> 00:09:14.360
did this in part B.

00:09:14.360 --> 00:09:19.720
e to the ln 4.2 times 3, that's
the same thing as-- Because

00:09:19.720 --> 00:09:22.110
this expression right
here is just 4.2.

00:09:22.110 --> 00:09:25.310
This is times 4.2 to the third.

00:09:25.310 --> 00:09:28.540
That's just a little bit of
logarithm math we did here.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.860
And it's the same exact logic.

00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:34.110
All I did is I substituted
3 here and simplified.

00:09:34.110 --> 00:09:35.210
Hopefully that makes
sense to you.

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.140
If it doesn't, you might want
to use your calculator.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.300
But this all is actually a
pretty important thing to know.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:46.690
That e to the ln of x is
just equal to x, right?

00:09:46.690 --> 00:09:49.510
Because ln of x is essentially
saying what exponent do I

00:09:49.510 --> 00:09:51.950
have to raise e to to get x?

00:09:51.950 --> 00:09:55.550
So if I raise e to that
exponent, I get x.

00:09:55.550 --> 00:09:56.710
So that's all I'm saying here.

00:09:56.710 --> 00:10:02.130
That this right here is the
same thing as e to the

00:10:02.130 --> 00:10:06.440
ln 4.2 to the t, right?

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:08.040
Because if you were to
simplify, you just take

00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.430
this exponent and multiply
this and you'd get this.

00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:16.830
And so this is just
4.2 to the t, right?

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.550
Actually that's-- I should
have written our original

00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:19.550
equation as that.

00:10:19.550 --> 00:10:24.630
I could rewrite our original
bacterial function equation as

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:34.530
100 times-- using that same
thing --times 4.2

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:35.370
to the t power.

00:10:35.370 --> 00:10:38.320
Actually, that is a simpler
bacterial equation

00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.970
than this one.

00:10:38.970 --> 00:10:44.150
And so that would be even a
better answer for part A.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:46.440
And then that makes part
B even easier to solve.

00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:48.300
And then part C.

00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.020
Well part C is actually-- it
was easier to keep it in this

00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:55.500
form because taking a
derivative of e is easier than

00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:57.010
taking a derivative
of another base.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:59.620
And actually we would probably
want to convert backwards.

00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:01.340
So it's good we left it in that
form because it made the

00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:03.120
derivative all that easier.

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.730
But we could rewrite the
derivative as well.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:10.580
We could rewrite this
as b prime of t is

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:17.010
equal to 100 ln 4.2.

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:22.850
All of that times 4.2
to the t, right?

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:25.300
I just took a this-- Sorry.

00:11:25.300 --> 00:11:25.430
No.

00:11:25.430 --> 00:11:29.240
I took this and I
replaced it with this.

00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.400
Anyway, I got a little bit
messier than I wanted to.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:33.500
But then their final
question is when will the

00:11:33.500 --> 00:11:37.366
population reach 10,000?

00:11:37.366 --> 00:11:42.140
So let me see erase what
we did with part C.

00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:54.670
When will the population
reach 10,000?

00:11:54.670 --> 00:11:56.180
Let me write what we
have already done a

00:11:56.180 --> 00:11:58.570
little bit neater.

00:11:58.570 --> 00:12:04.790
We know-- We knew that, part A,
b of t is equal to 100 e to

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:07.110
the natural log of 4.2t.

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:14.590
And I said that's the
same thing as 100 times

00:12:14.590 --> 00:12:17.716
4.2 to the t power.

00:12:17.716 --> 00:12:20.370
And they say when will the
population reach 10,000?

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:22.920
So they're essentially saying
when is-- at what time t

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:24.490
is b of t equal to 10,000?

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:37.140
So we can just say 10,000 is
equal to this: 100-- And

00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.330
actually, I'm going to use this
one because I want to take the

00:12:39.330 --> 00:12:39.950
natural log of both sides.

00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:41.520
And it just makes
things simpler.

00:12:41.520 --> 00:12:49.020
100e to the ln 4.2t.

00:12:51.740 --> 00:12:53.770
So you could divide
both sides by 100.

00:12:53.770 --> 00:13:05.570
And you get 100 is equal
to e to the ln 4.2t.

00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:10.360
And now take the natural
logs of both sides of

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:12.460
this equation, right?

00:13:12.460 --> 00:13:14.390
So then we get what?

00:13:14.390 --> 00:13:16.715
We get-- let me draw a
divide-- Well, I'll do

00:13:16.715 --> 00:13:18.320
it in a different color.

00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:20.850
We get-- taking the natural log
of both sides of this --the

00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:27.060
natural log of 100 is equal
to-- Well if you take the

00:13:27.060 --> 00:13:29.680
natural log of e to
something, you're just left

00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:31.330
with the something.

00:13:31.330 --> 00:13:33.920
And you might want to review
all the logarithms if you found

00:13:33.920 --> 00:13:34.720
that a little confusing.

00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:36.660
But that-- If you take
the natural log of this

00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:39.710
side, you're just left
with the exponent.

00:13:39.710 --> 00:13:44.665
So that equals ln of 4.2t.

00:13:44.665 --> 00:13:47.090
And if you want to solve for
t, you just divide both

00:13:47.090 --> 00:13:48.940
sides by ln of 4.2.

00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:53.700
And you get t is equal
to ln of 100 divided by

00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:56.280
the natural log of 4.2.

00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.290
And that'll be an hour.

00:13:57.290 --> 00:13:58.260
So how many hours does it take?

00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.030
You just plug this in your
calculator and you will get a

00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.890
number for the number of hours.

00:14:02.890 --> 00:14:04.580
Hopefully you didn't find
that too confusing.

00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:07.460
And actually since-- Just to
hit another point home, we

00:14:07.460 --> 00:14:08.760
could have used this equation.

00:14:08.760 --> 00:14:10.340
And it's the same thing, right?

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:11.170
And what would we
would have had?

00:14:11.170 --> 00:14:19.400
We would have had 100 times 4.2
to t power is equal to 10,000.

00:14:19.400 --> 00:14:23.980
Divide both sides by 100
and you get 4.2 to the

00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.310
t is equal to 100.

00:14:27.310 --> 00:14:30.950
And so, to solve this-- So
you're essentially saying log

00:14:30.950 --> 00:14:33.650
base-- You would essentially
want to take log base 4.2

00:14:33.650 --> 00:14:34.630
of both sides of this.

00:14:34.630 --> 00:14:42.520
So you would say t is equal
to log base 4.2 of 100.

00:14:42.520 --> 00:14:45.370
And I went over this in the
exponent proper-- in the

00:14:45.370 --> 00:14:47.600
logarithm properties video.

00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:50.360
But it's a pretty useful
thing to know in general.

00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:53.060
How do you figure out-- Your
calculator has two bases.

00:14:53.060 --> 00:14:56.050
It has log base 10 and it
has log base e, which

00:14:56.050 --> 00:14:57.140
is the natural log.

00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.210
How do you figure out log base
of another number of 100?

00:15:00.210 --> 00:15:04.200
Well, the simple answer is you
could take natural log of this

00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:06.700
and divide it by the
natural log of this.

00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:10.080
You could also take log base
ten of this and divide it by

00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.960
log ten base of this--
log base ten of this.

00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:16.490
Anyway, hopefully I didn't
further confuse you.

00:15:16.490 --> 00:15:19.880
And I will do-- This was
actually exponential growth.

00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:21.730
And you could replace
these words.

00:15:21.730 --> 00:15:24.460
You could say-- Instead of
saying bacteria culture, you

00:15:24.460 --> 00:15:27.680
could say a bank account
initially contains $100 and

00:15:27.680 --> 00:15:31.400
grows at a rate proportional
to its size, which would

00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:32.610
mean compound interest.

00:15:32.610 --> 00:15:35.920
And then you could say, after
an hour the population has

00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:39.480
increased to, whatever, $4.20.

00:15:39.480 --> 00:15:41.500
And then find the expression
for the number of-- So

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:43.290
essentially, you'd be trying
to figure out the compound

00:15:43.290 --> 00:15:44.290
interest rate and all of that.

00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:46.160
But this is the exact
same phenomenon.

00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.020
That the larger you grow,
you're going to grow by an

00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:51.420
absolute value more than that.

00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.102
Anyway, I'll do more of these
problems because they can

00:15:53.102 --> 00:15:53.870
be a little confusing.

00:15:53.870 --> 00:15:56.950
And I'll do one on
exponential decay as well.

00:15:56.950 --> 00:15:58.660
See you soon.
