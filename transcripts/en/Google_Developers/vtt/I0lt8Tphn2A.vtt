00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:04.010
Hello, my name is Maya Ben Ari,
and I'm the product manager

00:00:04.010 --> 00:00:06.950
for Android authentication
and authorization.

00:00:06.950 --> 00:00:10.260
Our goal is to deliver you the
best, smoothest, most secure

00:00:10.260 --> 00:00:11.712
authentication possible.

00:00:11.712 --> 00:00:13.170
And I'd like to
share with you some

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:15.530
of the things we're working on.

00:00:15.530 --> 00:00:17.440
Passwords suck.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.840
You're asked to enter your
password over and over

00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:21.580
throughout the course of a day.

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.240
If you have a lock
screen set you

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:27.840
need to enter your pin or
password many times per day.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.740
While we absolutely believe
your personal information should

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:34.710
stay secure, our vision is to
make this experience seamless

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.440
and frictionless
so that you will

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:38.910
have to authenticate
fewer times per day

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:43.270
while increasing challenges for
anyone pretending to be you.

00:00:43.270 --> 00:00:45.960
When you hold your phone,
it should magically

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.280
know that it is with you.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:50.580
We'd like to
differentiate between you

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:52.950
and someone
pretending to be you.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:56.260
When your phone is with
you, it can stay unlocked.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:58.200
As it moves out of
your control, it

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:01.020
should lock to keep
your photos, messages,

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:04.040
and personal information secure.

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:05.650
Our first step in
this direction is

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.840
to establish that your
phone is with you.

00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:10.530
We're adding multiple
new unlock mechanisms,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.230
such as fingerprint support,
voice identification,

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.120
active Bluetooth connections
to your trusted devices,

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.930
and trusted places.

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.990
For example, active connections
to your trusted Bluetooth

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.970
devices can be used to
help authenticate yourself

00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:26.780
to your mobile device.

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:30.510
Right now, I'm wearing
an Android wear device.

00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:32.930
I currently have a lock
screen set on my phone.

00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:36.570
If I unlock my phone and add
my Android Wear to my trusted

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:39.380
devices, my Wear
device can be used

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.630
to keep my mobile unlocked.

00:01:41.630 --> 00:01:43.860
Now, because I have
an active connection,

00:01:43.860 --> 00:01:47.230
if I press the power button
I won't see the lock screen

00:01:47.230 --> 00:01:49.660
challenge as before.

00:01:49.660 --> 00:01:53.140
You can also set a trusted
place such as your home

00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:55.370
or your office.

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:57.770
A place is defined as a
combination of things,

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:00.460
including your location
and networks around you

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:03.640
where you enable your
mobile to stay unlocked.

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.770
I know my workplace
is secure, so I

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:09.490
can go in to Trusted Places
and add my work building

00:02:09.490 --> 00:02:11.300
as a trusted place.

00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:13.590
Because I'm at
work now, my mobile

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.780
identifies that it
is in my trusted

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:19.450
places and the next time I
press the power button I won't

00:02:19.450 --> 00:02:21.770
see the lock screen challenge.

00:02:21.770 --> 00:02:24.200
This is just the beginning
of better authentication

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.740
with your mobile device.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:28.620
With time, we will extend
to additional mechanisms

00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:31.180
to establish your
mobile is with you.

00:02:31.180 --> 00:02:34.840
Now, the next exciting part is
that once we have established

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:36.620
that your mobile
is with you, you

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:38.810
should be able to use
it to identify you

00:02:38.810 --> 00:02:43.240
to other devices such as your
TV, your car entertainment

00:02:43.240 --> 00:02:45.710
system, and even your laptop.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:48.700
If my Chromebook detects
my mobile is nearby

00:02:48.700 --> 00:02:51.680
and my mobile identifies
it is with me,

00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:54.070
I should be able to log
into my Chromebook account

00:02:54.070 --> 00:02:56.720
without the need of
entering my password.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.230
My Chromebook
profile is currently

00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:00.890
locked as indicated
by the Lock icon.

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:04.320
If I place my unlocked
mobile nearby my Chromebook,

00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:06.060
the Lock icon changes.

00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:10.730
Now I can log into my profile
without entering any password.

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:13.210
Finally, in the
future, establishing

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:15.380
that your mobile is
with you could also

00:03:15.380 --> 00:03:17.660
eliminate the need
to reauthenticate

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:19.870
for purposes like purchases.

00:03:19.870 --> 00:03:22.680
Why should I reenter my
password for small purchases

00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:26.110
if my phone already knows
that it's me in control?

00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:28.150
This is just the
first step in creating

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.460
seamless, magical,
secure authentication

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:32.210
for your mobile device.

00:03:32.210 --> 00:03:34.180
With time, we will
extend the means

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:35.970
to establish the
phone is with you.

00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:38.070
And with multiple
devices around you,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:40.090
we're working on many
more exciting ways

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.380
to interact between devices
while not just maintaining,

00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:46.190
but even increasing
your security.

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:49.250
I hope you are as excited by the
possibilities of authentication

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:50.180
as I am.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.245
Thank you for watching.
