SHAZIA MAKHDUMI: Hi, everyone.

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:08.630
I'm Shazia Makhdumi from
the Google Play team.

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:09.790
And I'm here to talk
to you about

00:00:09.790 --> 00:00:12.010
Google Play for Education.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.830
Imagine a world where every
student and classroom is

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:17.410
connected to the web.

00:00:17.410 --> 00:00:21.160
Imagine all the teachers are
able to find any piece of

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.300
content they want and
get it to the

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.280
right group of students.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.770
At Google, we've started to
make that vision a reality

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.600
with Google Play
for Education.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:32.380
It's a new initiative combining
portable Nexus

00:00:32.380 --> 00:00:35.140
tablets with highly
engaging content.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.380
So it includes a dedicated
online store.

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:40.650
And this is different
from Google Play.

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:45.100
And it's just for educators,
where content, including apps,

00:00:45.100 --> 00:00:49.480
books, video, is organized by
subject, by grade, by core

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:52.620
curriculum, just the way
teachers search for it.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:56.090
It includes tablets that are
priced affordability because

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:58.490
we want to bring that promise
of one-to-one learning into

00:00:58.490 --> 00:01:00.210
the classroom.

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.840
It includes easy purchasing
options for schools.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:06.160
So, for example, a teacher
can purchase an app

00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.780
and try it for free.

00:01:07.780 --> 00:01:09.940
They can do bulk purchasing.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:13.860
They can also use purchase
orders instead of credit cards

00:01:13.860 --> 00:01:16.180
since as a school you don't
have credit cards.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:18.960
And it also includes centralized
distribution of

00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:22.660
apps and content directly to
devices with one click.

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:27.420
So what's the opportunity
here for you?

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:31.660
It's in 3D living color,
specifically in distribution,

00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.880
discovery, and delivery.

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:37.140
So you're an app developer
creating apps for schools

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:40.530
wanting to reach students
and teachers directly.

00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:43.500
Google Play for Education will
help you reach that audience

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.230
without having to create
a sales force.

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.600
You're creating an app.

00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.830
And you want it to be discovered
by teachers looking

00:01:50.830 --> 00:01:53.410
for that particular
piece of content.

00:01:53.410 --> 00:01:56.260
The way Google Play for
Education is organized,

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.890
teachers can search by subject,
by grade, by core

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:01.560
curriculum component in a
variety of ways to be able to

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:03.990
find your app without having
to go through all the noise

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.050
and clutter.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.100
And then finally, if you want
your app to be purchased in

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:10.530
bulk at a classroom level, at
the school level, at the

00:02:10.530 --> 00:02:13.360
district level, or even the
state level, you don't have to

00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:13.890
do anything.

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.500
With Google Play for Education,
we allow teachers

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:20.170
to buy in bulk and also with one
click to provision it to

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:22.670
different devices.

00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:25.320
So Google's presence in
education includes

00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:26.750
Google Apps for EDU.

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:32.410
We've got 25 million users
worldwide, over 3,000 schools

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:39.040
using Chromebooks, and over
700,000 YouTube videos in EDU.

00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.190
And what that has done, that
footprint has helped us

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:45.800
establish an ecosystem
of partners in

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:47.320
the educational space.

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.255
And those partners, including
educators, came to us and

00:02:50.255 --> 00:02:52.180
asked what are we
doing in mobile?

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:55.090
And Google Play for Education
is the answer for them.

00:02:55.090 --> 00:02:56.980
It's a natural progression in

00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:00.110
Google's educational footprint.

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:05.150
Speaking of teacher feedback,
we've actually been piloting

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.960
this in a variety of schools
across the country and got a

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:10.810
lot of feedback from educators
on what they look for in apps.

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.350
And I wanted to share
that with you.

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.900
So these are some of the things
that you'd want your

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.450
app to be strong in.

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:20.926
Educational content is a
no-brainer, especially if it

00:03:20.926 --> 00:03:23.340
maps to core curriculum
where appropriate.

00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.290
Teachers definitely
care about that.

00:03:25.290 --> 00:03:27.270
They also want it to be
tablet optimized.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.190
Since we're using Android,
specifically Nexus 7 tablets

00:03:30.190 --> 00:03:32.340
for this, you want to make sure
that they have a good

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:33.880
user experience.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:36.510
It goes without saying, if
you're creating something for

00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:40.050
the K-12 market, you need to do
adhere both to regulations

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.470
as well as common sense.

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.110
So it shouldn't collect
personally identifiable

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.040
information.

00:03:44.040 --> 00:03:47.100
It should not have offensive
content, et cetera.

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:50.280
And another piece of feedback
that we've been hearing a lot

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.270
from across the board is that
teachers and students don't

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:57.630
want to remember multiple
login credentials to get

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:58.770
access to apps.

00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:01.380
So we encourage you to use
Google sign-on, so that with

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.670
one username and password, they
can access all the great

00:04:04.670 --> 00:04:07.420
content on their tablets.

00:04:07.420 --> 00:04:10.460
So let's take a look at Google
Play for Education.

00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.610
So here's the interface with
subjects organized by subject

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:15.360
on the left side.

00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.620
So let's say I'm a math
teacher teaching

00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:18.490
fourth grade math.

00:04:18.490 --> 00:04:20.529
And I really want to teach
my students about

00:04:20.529 --> 00:04:22.010
prime factors today.

00:04:22.010 --> 00:04:24.040
I can select mathematics.

00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:26.890
And then, I can also up
here select by grade.

00:04:26.890 --> 00:04:28.290
This is fourth grade.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.570
And this gives me all
the different

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:30.870
apps for fourth grade.

00:04:30.870 --> 00:04:34.760
And I am looking for something
for factors.

00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:38.230
And this is the particular
aspect in the core curriculum

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:39.620
that maps to that.

00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:41.960
So with just a couple of clicks,
I've been able to

00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:45.070
access all the different apps
that map to what I need to

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:45.980
teach that day.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:48.420
I can further filter it
by different types.

00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:52.090
So I can get other content
like books and videos.

00:04:52.090 --> 00:04:54.390
I can search for free or paid.

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.850
I can look for which
ones are top rated.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.990
And then, I can also look
at the intended user.

00:04:58.990 --> 00:05:00.910
So if I want to instruct today,
if I want it as a

00:05:00.910 --> 00:05:03.840
review tool, student
tool, et cetera.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:05.770
So this particular app
looks interesting.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.320
Let's get more information
on that.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.750
And I see it has a badge for
Q, which means that an

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.590
external vendor Q has reviewed
it and found that it is

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.270
appropriate for teachers.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.705
And I know that Q is composed
of teachers who

00:05:20.705 --> 00:05:21.660
are reviewing apps.

00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:26.200
And so as a teacher, I really
can rest assured that this app

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.660
corresponds to what
I need to teach.

00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:33.660
When I click on Order, I'm
able to select a group of

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:36.670
students that I already have set
up, my fourth grade class,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:39.690
and enter that group in there.

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:44.455
And with one click, I'm going to
be able to send this app to

00:05:44.455 --> 00:05:45.705
all the devices.

00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:50.140
I want to also now show you
how you can purchase using

00:05:50.140 --> 00:05:51.030
purchase orders.

00:05:51.030 --> 00:05:54.270
And for this, I am an Earth
Science chair at the school

00:05:54.270 --> 00:05:57.560
looking for an app regarding
the solar system.

00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.420
Now, I know I had checked this
app earlier through the free

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:02.880
trial and liked it.

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.680
It was Q approved,
which was great.

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.570
And I want to get it for my
fifth and sixth grade class.

00:06:07.570 --> 00:06:10.420
And there's about
150 students.

00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:11.620
So I'm going to click--

00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:13.810
I'm going to enter 150 there.

00:06:13.810 --> 00:06:17.050
And notice how the price
changes dynamically.

00:06:17.050 --> 00:06:21.230
And when I click on this, it
actually takes me to a screen

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.420
where I can select one of three
POs my school has open

00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.880
with Google already and use one
of them to pay for this.

00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.270
So no more having to pay with
my credit card and then

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:33.800
getting reimbursement
for that.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:36.440
And then finally, I want to show
you how you can search

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:38.110
for all sorts of content
on this.

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:41.510
So I'm a Chemistry
Club president.

00:06:41.510 --> 00:06:44.620
And I'm looking for content
on the periodic table.

00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:47.250
And I don't know what exactly
I'm looking for, but I know I

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.610
want to send some interesting
content out.

00:06:49.610 --> 00:06:51.900
I can just search by
periodic table.

00:06:51.900 --> 00:06:55.800
And I find not just a list of
great apps, but also books

00:06:55.800 --> 00:06:58.880
related to the periodic table
as well as videos.

00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:02.780
So I want to check out this
Khan Academy video on the

00:07:02.780 --> 00:07:04.000
periodic table.

00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:07.700
And I'm able to look at it right
there within Google Play

00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:10.600
for Education to determine
whether or not it's something

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:13.600
that I'd want to send
to students.

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.480
And it is.

00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:16.990
Great.

00:07:16.990 --> 00:07:18.440
I'm able to order it.

00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:22.010
And again, having set up the
Chemistry Club group at my

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:25.460
school earlier, with one click,
I'm able to send it to

00:07:25.460 --> 00:07:28.580
specifically those devices.

00:07:28.580 --> 00:07:32.620
So that was a quick view of
Google Play for Education.

00:07:32.620 --> 00:07:36.340
I encourage you to go to
developer.android.com/edu,

00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.440
where there's a lot more details
on what I was talking

00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:41.060
about, and also a chance
to sign up to get more

00:07:41.060 --> 00:07:43.030
information as it becomes
available.

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:47.210
And together with you guys and
Google, we can actually help

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.930
transform K-12 education and
make that vision I was talking

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:51.400
about earlier a reality.

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.650
Thank you so much for
your interest.
