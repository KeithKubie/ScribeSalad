00:00:01.859 --> 00:00:03.879
You might think there was a simple to answer
to this.

00:00:03.879 --> 00:00:07.200
After all, we know how to say what most things
are for, like this

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:08.389
or that

00:00:08.389 --> 00:00:10.370
And people flock to museums like never before,

00:00:10.370 --> 00:00:12.419
so they must have their motives.

00:00:12.419 --> 00:00:17.140
But when it comes to art, people get strangely
afraid to ask too directly what it might all

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.420
be for - because

00:00:19.420 --> 00:00:21.380
well, everyone except you might know the answer
already

00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:22.350
It’s perhaps too obvious

00:00:22.350 --> 00:00:23.670
It’s perhaps too complicated

00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:25.390
The result is an awkward silence

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:26.890
and a lot of confusion.

00:00:26.890 --> 00:00:30.200
But maybe it shouldn’t be that hard to say
what art is for.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:34.680
Maybe we can have a go at ascribing certain
rather clear purposes to art.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:38.030
Here’s five things art might be able to
do for us:

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.470
It’s an obvious but striking fact that the
most popular works of art in the world show

00:00:43.470 --> 00:00:47.660
pretty things: happy people, flowers in spring,
blue skies.

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:52.739
This is the top selling postcard in the world
from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York

00:00:52.739 --> 00:00:53.550
 

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:59.260
This enthusiasm for prettiness worries serious
types a lot. They wonder: have people forgotten

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.360
what life is really like?

00:01:01.360 --> 00:01:06.500
But that seems a misplaced worry. We need
pretty things close to us not because we’re

00:01:06.500 --> 00:01:10.610
in danger of forgetting the bad stuff, but
because terrible problems weigh so heavily

00:01:10.610 --> 00:01:14.530
on us, that we’re in danger of slipping
into despair and depression.

00:01:14.530 --> 00:01:20.060
That’s why prettiness matters. It’s an
emblem of hope, which is an achievement. Prettiness,

00:01:20.060 --> 00:01:25.720
those flowers and blue skies and kids in meadows,
is hope bottled and preserved, waiting for

00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:28.810
us when we need it.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.740
The world often requires us to put on a cheerful
facade

00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.960
But beneath the surface, there’s a lot of
sadness and regret that we can’t express

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.790
from fear of seeming weird or a loser.

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.280
One thing art can do is to reassure us of
the normality of pain, it can be sad with

00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.590
and for us.

00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:49.210
Some of the world’s greatest works of art
have been loved for their capacity to make

00:01:49.210 --> 00:01:53.930
the pain that’s inside all of us more publically
visible and available.

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:59.390
Like putting on a sad piece of music, sombre
works of art don’t have to depress us...

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:05.329
...rather they can give us the welcome feeling
that pain is part of the human condition.

00:02:05.329 --> 00:02:08.399
Art fights the false optimism of commercial
society

00:02:08.399 --> 00:02:14.069
It’s there to remind us with dignity that
every good life has extraordinary amounts

00:02:14.069 --> 00:02:18.440
of confusion, suffering, loneliness and distress
within it.

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:23.860
and that therefore we should never aggravate
sadness by feeling we must be freakish simply

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:26.900
for experiencing quite a lot.

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:31.630
All of us are a little unbalanced in some
way.

00:02:31.630 --> 00:02:36.190
We’re too intellectual or too emotional,
too masculine or too feminine, too calm or

00:02:36.190 --> 00:02:36.730
too excitable…

00:02:36.730 --> 00:02:42.700
The art we love is frequently something we’re
drawn to because it compensates us for what

00:02:42.700 --> 00:02:45.590
we lack: it counterbalances us.

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.260
When we’re moved by a work of art, it may
be because it contains concentrated dose of

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:53.410
qualities we need more of in our lives.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:57.330
Perhaps it’s full of the serenity we admire,
but don’t have enough of

00:02:57.330 --> 00:03:01.250
Perhaps it’s got the tenderness we long
for, but that our jobs and relationships are

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:02.420
currently lacking

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.099
Or perhaps it’s suffused with a pain and
drama we’ve had to stifle but want to get

00:03:07.099 --> 00:03:08.500
in touch with.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.890
Sometimes a whole society falls in love with
a certain style in art, because it’s trying

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.819
to rebalance itself, like France in the late
18th century

00:03:16.819 --> 00:03:21.819
that wanted David as a corrective to its decadence,
or Britain in the 19th century that looked

00:03:21.819 --> 00:03:27.599
to the pre-Raphaelites to counter the effects
of brutal industrialisation

00:03:27.599 --> 00:03:33.190
The art a country or a person calls ‘beautiful’
gives you vital clues as to what is missing

00:03:33.190 --> 00:03:33.890
in them.

00:03:33.890 --> 00:03:40.890
It’s in the power of art to help us be more
rounded, more balanced and more sane.

00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:47.129
The media is constantly giving us hints about
what’s glamorous and important

00:03:47.129 --> 00:03:51.060
Art also tells us about what’s glamorous
and important, but fortunately &nbsp;- given that

00:03:51.060 --> 00:03:54.819
you weren’t invited again to the Oscars
this year - it usually picks on some very

00:03:54.819 --> 00:03:56.489
different things.

00:03:56.489 --> 00:03:59.099
Albrecht Durer makes grass look glamorous

00:03:59.099 --> 00:04:01.629
John Constable draws our attention to the
skies:

00:04:01.629 --> 00:04:04.879
Van Gogh reminds us that oranges are worth
paying attention to

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:08.900
Marcel Duchamp challenges us to look again
at the seemingly mundane

00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:12.720
These artists aren’t falsely glamorising
things that are better ignored, they’re

00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:18.519
justly teasing out a value that’s been neglected
by a world with a deeply distorted and unfair

00:04:18.519 --> 00:04:24.189
sense of what truly matters. Art returns glamour
to its rightful place, highlighting what is

00:04:24.189 --> 00:04:26.100
genuinely worth appreciating.

00:04:31.189 --> 00:04:35.909
Nothing seems further from good art than propaganda;
the sort encouraging you to fight

00:04:35.909 --> 00:04:39.139
or what government to support

00:04:39.139 --> 00:04:43.550
But one way to think about art is that it
is a sort of propaganda, in the sense of a

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:48.770
tool that motivates and energises you for
a cause - only it is propaganda on behalf

00:04:48.770 --> 00:04:53.979
of some of the most important and nicest emotions
and attitudes in the world - which it uses

00:04:53.979 --> 00:04:56.949
its skills to make newly appealling and accessible.

00:04:56.949 --> 00:04:59.919
It might be propaganda about the simple life:

00:04:59.919 --> 00:05:02.479
Or about the need to broaden one’s horizons

00:05:02.479 --> 00:05:05.119
Or about a more playful, tender approach to
life

00:05:05.119 --> 00:05:11.050
It’s a force that stands up for the best
sides of human nature and gives them a platform

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:15.300
and an authority in a noisy, distracted world.

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:20.610
For too long, art has attracted a little too
much reverence and mystique for its own good.

00:05:20.610 --> 00:05:25.479
In its presence, we’re like someone meeting
a very famous person. We get stiff and lose

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:26.490
our spontaneity.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:29.430
We should relax around it, as we already do
with music:

00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:33.749
and learn to use it for what it’s really
meant for: as a constant source of support

00:05:33.749 --> 00:05:36.109
and encouragement for our better selves.
