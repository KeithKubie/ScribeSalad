Now I want you to try this, match the following brain structures to the type of

00:00:03.166 --> 00:00:09.545
memory. Again, we have the cerebellum, striatum, amygdala, and hippocampus. And

00:00:09.545 --> 00:00:12.155
here are the type of memories, so one type of memory would be your first

00:00:12.155 --> 00:00:16.406
heartbreak. What part of the brain would be involved in this type of memory. If

00:00:16.406 --> 00:00:20.438
I asked you what happened during World War II what part of your brain would you

00:00:20.438 --> 00:00:25.653
use to recall this information? If you had to remember how to ride a bike, what

00:00:25.653 --> 00:00:29.529
part of the brain would you use? Type the corresponding letter to the type of

00:00:29.529 --> 00:00:32.220
memory that this brain structure is involved in.
