talk about the elephant in the room to
begin with which is our source code so

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:45.930
begin with which is our source code so
 

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:48.610
begin with which is our source code so
in making apps beautiful we showed

00:00:48.610 --> 00:00:48.620
in making apps beautiful we showed
 

00:00:48.620 --> 00:00:51.860
in making apps beautiful we showed
different stages of the apps the app

00:00:51.860 --> 00:00:51.870
different stages of the apps the app
 

00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:53.959
different stages of the apps the app
that we were building and people are

00:00:53.959 --> 00:00:53.969
that we were building and people are
 

00:00:53.969 --> 00:00:55.279
that we were building and people are
asking if we were going to release the

00:00:55.279 --> 00:00:55.289
asking if we were going to release the
 

00:00:55.289 --> 00:00:56.900
asking if we were going to release the
source code and the answer is yes we're

00:00:56.900 --> 00:00:56.910
source code and the answer is yes we're
 

00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:58.220
source code and the answer is yes we're
going to do that we're going to do that

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:58.230
going to do that we're going to do that
 

00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.200
going to do that we're going to do that
very shortly i'm just cleaning it up and

00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:00.210
very shortly i'm just cleaning it up and
 

00:01:00.210 --> 00:01:02.779
very shortly i'm just cleaning it up and
preparing it so that you can have a look

00:01:02.779 --> 00:01:02.789

dig through it again yeah and also had

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:08.790
dig through it again yeah and also had
 

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:10.370
dig through it again yeah and also had
to follow up questions from this yeah

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:10.380
to follow up questions from this yeah
 

00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:12.350
to follow up questions from this yeah
yeah so we hadn't had a very popular

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:12.360
yeah so we hadn't had a very popular
 

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.630
yeah so we hadn't had a very popular
question on the cards layer but a lot of

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:14.640
question on the cards layer but a lot of
 

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:16.130
question on the cards layer but a lot of
people seem really excited about and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.140
people seem really excited about and
 

00:01:16.140 --> 00:01:18.740
people seem really excited about and
those are follow-up question from the

00:01:18.740 --> 00:01:18.750
those are follow-up question from the
 

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:20.390
those are follow-up question from the
tiny met who was asking a bit more about

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:20.400
tiny met who was asking a bit more about
 

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:23.210
tiny met who was asking a bit more about
the specifics of implementing a a cart

00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:23.220
the specifics of implementing a a cart
 

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.770
the specifics of implementing a a cart
lay out there to be dynamic so you can

00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:24.780
lay out there to be dynamic so you can
 

00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:26.090
lay out there to be dynamic so you can
have different different sized cards

00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.100
have different different sized cards
 

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:28.580
have different different sized cards
together and I thought about this a bit

00:01:28.580 --> 00:01:28.590
together and I thought about this a bit
 

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.560
together and I thought about this a bit
more and I think that it's lots of

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:30.570
more and I think that it's lots of
 

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.149
more and I think that it's lots of
different ways you can do this so one

00:01:32.149 --> 00:01:32.159
different ways you can do this so one
 

00:01:32.159 --> 00:01:33.770
different ways you can do this so one
way we've done it is that we have

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:33.780
way we've done it is that we have
 

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.539
way we've done it is that we have
actually used our own view group so if

00:01:35.539 --> 00:01:35.549
actually used our own view group so if
 

00:01:35.549 --> 00:01:36.560
actually used our own view group so if
you want to have something to with my

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:36.570
you want to have something to with my
 

00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:38.060
you want to have something to with my
app's rating in s and you can just add

00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:38.070
app's rating in s and you can just add
 

00:01:38.070 --> 00:01:39.770
app's rating in s and you can just add
John Connor to it and I think that's a

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:39.780
John Connor to it and I think that's a
 

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.120
John Connor to it and I think that's a
bit more work involved you would

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.130
bit more work involved you would
 

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:44.030
bit more work involved you would
actually have to look at like it to look

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:44.040
actually have to look at like it to look
 

00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:46.219
actually have to look at like it to look
at all running with your group and doing

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
at all running with your group and doing
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.020
at all running with your group and doing
your own measurements and layouts and

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:48.030
your own measurements and layouts and
 

00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:49.639
your own measurements and layouts and
all that kind of stuff but if it's just

00:01:49.639 --> 00:01:49.649
all that kind of stuff but if it's just
 

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:51.020
all that kind of stuff but if it's just
something as simple as you know

00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:51.030
something as simple as you know
 

00:01:51.030 --> 00:01:52.730
something as simple as you know
displaying different sized content and

00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:52.740
displaying different sized content and
 

00:01:52.740 --> 00:01:55.370
displaying different sized content and
you know just a list basically just say

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:55.380
you know just a list basically just say
 

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.370
you know just a list basically just say
you know the resizable layout might just

00:01:58.370 --> 00:01:58.380
you know the resizable layout might just
 

00:01:58.380 --> 00:02:00.080
you know the resizable layout might just
do the Majesty the trick into nine patch

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:00.090
do the Majesty the trick into nine patch
 

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:02.149
do the Majesty the trick into nine patch
in the background so there might be a

00:02:02.149 --> 00:02:02.159
in the background so there might be a
 

00:02:02.159 --> 00:02:03.980
in the background so there might be a
bit more work involved but simply using

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:03.990
bit more work involved but simply using
 

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:04.969
bit more work involved but simply using
a nine patch and different sized

00:02:04.969 --> 00:02:04.979
a nine patch and different sized
 

00:02:04.979 --> 00:02:06.980
a nine patch and different sized
containers might might work for you yeah

00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:06.990
containers might might work for you yeah
 

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:09.499
containers might might work for you yeah
and just to follow up as well the person

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
and just to follow up as well the person
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.180
and just to follow up as well the person
was asking about a 48 deeper rid of

00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:11.190
was asking about a 48 deeper rid of
 

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.290
was asking about a 48 deeper rid of
rhythm now for only talking

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:13.300
rhythm now for only talking
 

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:14.970
rhythm now for only talking
it's something that's similar to the

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:14.980
it's something that's similar to the
 

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:18.390
it's something that's similar to the
cards layout you know 48 dips just have

00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:18.400
cards layout you know 48 dips just have
 

00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:20.280
cards layout you know 48 dips just have
a look at it it might not be quite right

00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:20.290
a look at it it might not be quite right
 

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:21.720
a look at it it might not be quite right
because typically a lot of these cards

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:21.730
because typically a lot of these cards
 

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:23.580
because typically a lot of these cards
you tend to have some rich content you

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:23.590
you tend to have some rich content you
 

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:25.620
you tend to have some rich content you
have some buttons that you can press as

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:25.630
have some buttons that you can press as
 

00:02:25.630 --> 00:02:28.500
have some buttons that you can press as
well and if you try to squash all of

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:28.510
well and if you try to squash all of
 

00:02:28.510 --> 00:02:31.650
well and if you try to squash all of
that information into a 48 dip layout

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:31.660
that information into a 48 dip layout
 

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.360
that information into a 48 dip layout
you might find that you don't have

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:33.370
you might find that you don't have
 

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:35.940
you might find that you don't have
enough space so you know I wouldn't say

00:02:35.940 --> 00:02:35.950
enough space so you know I wouldn't say
 

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:37.980
enough space so you know I wouldn't say
that you need to follow the 48 dip

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:37.990
that you need to follow the 48 dip
 

00:02:37.990 --> 00:02:40.080
that you need to follow the 48 dip
rhythm for cards layout to the letter

00:02:40.080 --> 00:02:40.090
rhythm for cards layout to the letter
 

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:42.270
rhythm for cards layout to the letter
see what works well and provide the

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:42.280
see what works well and provide the
 

00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:44.100
see what works well and provide the
better user experience and if you think

00:02:44.100 --> 00:02:44.110
better user experience and if you think
 

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:46.140
better user experience and if you think
about how these carts layouts have been

00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.150
about how these carts layouts have been
 

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:47.520
about how these carts layouts have been
used in the past for example the Play

00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:47.530
used in the past for example the Play
 

00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:49.290
used in the past for example the Play
Store there's obviously a big touch talk

00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:49.300
Store there's obviously a big touch talk
 

00:02:49.300 --> 00:02:50.460
Store there's obviously a big touch talk
in this case it's generally the

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:50.470
in this case it's generally the
 

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.740
in this case it's generally the
application icon or the movies icon or

00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:52.750
application icon or the movies icon or
 

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.300
application icon or the movies icon or
something but something bit you can hit

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:54.310
something but something bit you can hit
 

00:02:54.310 --> 00:02:56.280
something but something bit you can hit
so it's something to keep in mind when

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:56.290
so it's something to keep in mind when
 

00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:59.490
so it's something to keep in mind when

you desire use interface yeah okay so uh
 

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:02.520
you desire use interface yeah okay so uh
yeah thanks a follow-up questions good

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:07.570
yeah the tiny map ok so we had some some
 

00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:09.780
yeah the tiny map ok so we had some some
questions around the the layout XML

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:09.790
questions around the the layout XML
 

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:11.550

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:13.630
episode yeah the questions were actually
 

00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:16.470
episode yeah the questions were actually
around using references rather than just

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:16.480
around using references rather than just
 

00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.600
around using references rather than just

resource folders so do we want to sort
 

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:25.800
resource folders so do we want to sort
of yeah so one one big reason for this

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:25.810
of yeah so one one big reason for this
 

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:27.060
of yeah so one one big reason for this
is that you don't want to duplicate your

00:03:27.060 --> 00:03:27.070
is that you don't want to duplicate your
 

00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:29.430
is that you don't want to duplicate your
layouts right so if you want to reuse

00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:29.440
layouts right so if you want to reuse
 

00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:31.710
layouts right so if you want to reuse
your layouts it's as much easier to just

00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:31.720
your layouts it's as much easier to just
 

00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:33.690
your layouts it's as much easier to just
have references use reference references

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:33.700
have references use reference references
 

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:35.190
have references use reference references
rather than copy and pasting the files

00:03:35.190 --> 00:03:35.200
rather than copy and pasting the files
 

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.320
rather than copy and pasting the files
multiple times in the APK you know

00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:37.330
multiple times in the APK you know
 

00:03:37.330 --> 00:03:39.210
multiple times in the APK you know
blowed up the APK as well but that's

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:39.220
blowed up the APK as well but that's
 

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.880
blowed up the APK as well but that's
another reason as well i mean before

00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:41.890
another reason as well i mean before
 

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.660
another reason as well i mean before
android api level 13 its android a 3-2

00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:45.670
android api level 13 its android a 3-2
 

00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:50.130
android api level 13 its android a 3-2
honeycomb you only had these buckets

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:50.140
honeycomb you only had these buckets
 

00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:51.360
honeycomb you only had these buckets
that allows you to look at the screen

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:51.370
that allows you to look at the screen
 

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:53.490
that allows you to look at the screen
size the actual screen size of the

00:03:53.490 --> 00:03:53.500
size the actual screen size of the
 

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:55.710
size the actual screen size of the
device so like small normal large and

00:03:55.710 --> 00:03:55.720
device so like small normal large and
 

00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:57.750
device so like small normal large and
extra large screens so a tablet would be

00:03:57.750 --> 00:03:57.760
extra large screens so a tablet would be
 

00:03:57.760 --> 00:04:00.000
extra large screens so a tablet would be
an extra large screen bucket for example

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.010
an extra large screen bucket for example
 

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.940
an extra large screen bucket for example
and the problem is this this really

00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:02.950
and the problem is this this really
 

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.710
and the problem is this this really
didn't give you fine grained control

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:04.720
didn't give you fine grained control
 

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:06.720
didn't give you fine grained control
because sometimes some device we get

00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:06.730
because sometimes some device we get
 

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:08.100
because sometimes some device we get
classified as extra large but actually a

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.110
classified as extra large but actually a
 

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:09.570
classified as extra large but actually a
phone for example right but it's really

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:09.580
phone for example right but it's really
 

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.699
phone for example right but it's really
tricky to take this apart and and

00:04:11.699 --> 00:04:11.709
tricky to take this apart and and
 

00:04:11.709 --> 00:04:13.290
tricky to take this apart and and
actually provide a tablet on your layout

00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:13.300
actually provide a tablet on your layout
 

00:04:13.300 --> 00:04:15.990
actually provide a tablet on your layout
and the phone on the layout so above API

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:16.000
and the phone on the layout so above API
 

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.599
and the phone on the layout so above API
level 13 sorry api level 30 and above

00:04:18.599 --> 00:04:18.609
level 13 sorry api level 30 and above
 

00:04:18.609 --> 00:04:21.599
level 13 sorry api level 30 and above
and we actually introduced some resource

00:04:21.599 --> 00:04:21.609
and we actually introduced some resource
 

00:04:21.609 --> 00:04:23.520
and we actually introduced some resource
modifiers that you can use to look at

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:23.530
modifiers that you can use to look at
 

00:04:23.530 --> 00:04:25.110
modifiers that you can use to look at
the available screen size you can look

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:25.120
the available screen size you can look
 

00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.150
the available screen size you can look
at the smaller

00:04:26.150 --> 00:04:26.160
at the smaller
 

00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:28.010
at the smaller
that's available on the device and it

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:28.020
that's available on the device and it
 

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.660
that's available on the device and it
doesn't change for rotation so in this

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:29.670
doesn't change for rotation so in this
 

00:04:29.670 --> 00:04:30.920
doesn't change for rotation so in this
case then you've been me when you want

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:30.930
case then you've been me when you want
 

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.470
case then you've been me when you want
to define a layout for the 4 Nexus 7 for

00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:33.480
to define a layout for the 4 Nexus 7 for
 

00:04:33.480 --> 00:04:35.660
to define a layout for the 4 Nexus 7 for
example like an axiom a 7-inch tablet

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:35.670
example like an axiom a 7-inch tablet
 

00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.760
example like an axiom a 7-inch tablet
you would look at 600 EP or 10 inch

00:04:37.760 --> 00:04:37.770
you would look at 600 EP or 10 inch
 

00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:40.910
you would look at 600 EP or 10 inch
tablet would be a 720 DP so that's

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:40.920
tablet would be a 720 DP so that's
 

00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:42.710
tablet would be a 720 DP so that's
that's really useful as well so and this

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:42.720
that's really useful as well so and this
 

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.180
that's really useful as well so and this
is where these references come in really

00:04:44.180 --> 00:04:44.190
is where these references come in really
 

00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:45.500
is where these references come in really
handy but you can just reuse your

00:04:45.500 --> 00:04:45.510
handy but you can just reuse your
 

00:04:45.510 --> 00:04:47.780
handy but you can just reuse your
layouts in different ways yeah just to

00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:47.790
layouts in different ways yeah just to
 

00:04:47.790 --> 00:04:50.720
layouts in different ways yeah just to
add to that as well with the the

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:50.730
add to that as well with the the
 

00:04:50.730 --> 00:04:52.490
add to that as well with the the
qualifiers that we added you'll notice

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:52.500
qualifiers that we added you'll notice
 

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:54.170
qualifiers that we added you'll notice
that there now numerical so you're

00:04:54.170 --> 00:04:54.180
that there now numerical so you're
 

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:56.510
that there now numerical so you're
talking about measurements it will make

00:04:56.510 --> 00:04:56.520
talking about measurements it will make
 

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.340
talking about measurements it will make
physical sizes of devices where as

00:04:58.340 --> 00:04:58.350
physical sizes of devices where as
 

00:04:58.350 --> 00:04:59.420
physical sizes of devices where as
before when you had these arbitrary

00:04:59.420 --> 00:04:59.430
before when you had these arbitrary
 

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.610
before when you had these arbitrary
buckets it was getting hard to classify

00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:01.620
buckets it was getting hard to classify
 

00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:04.730
buckets it was getting hard to classify
a device in large or extra-large because

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:04.740
a device in large or extra-large because
 

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.590
a device in large or extra-large because
the you know one of the strengths of the

00:05:06.590 --> 00:05:06.600
the you know one of the strengths of the
 

00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:08.960
the you know one of the strengths of the
Android ecosystem is the variety of

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:08.970
Android ecosystem is the variety of
 

00:05:08.970 --> 00:05:11.150
Android ecosystem is the variety of
screen sizes so you can get small

00:05:11.150 --> 00:05:11.160
screen sizes so you can get small
 

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:13.430
screen sizes so you can get small
tablets and large phones that that could

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:13.440
tablets and large phones that that could
 

00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:15.440
tablets and large phones that that could
be large extra-large it could be medium

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:15.450
be large extra-large it could be medium
 

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.360
be large extra-large it could be medium
whereas when you talk about these

00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:17.370
whereas when you talk about these
 

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.840
whereas when you talk about these
qualifies when you say 600 DP you're now

00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:20.850
qualifies when you say 600 DP you're now
 

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.790
qualifies when you say 600 DP you're now
is putting a physical measurement around

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:22.800
is putting a physical measurement around
 

00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:25.250
is putting a physical measurement around
the the dimensions of that device so

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:25.260
the the dimensions of that device so
 

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.020
the the dimensions of that device so
that's why it works a lot better yeah

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:27.030
that's why it works a lot better yeah
 

00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:28.820
that's why it works a lot better yeah
yeah exactly and it's also poured note

00:05:28.820 --> 00:05:28.830
yeah exactly and it's also poured note
 

00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.680
yeah exactly and it's also poured note
that this is the available size so is

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:30.690
that this is the available size so is
 

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:31.880
that this is the available size so is
this the size that's actually available

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:31.890
this the size that's actually available
 

00:05:31.890 --> 00:05:33.530
this the size that's actually available
to your application we're not just

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:33.540
to your application we're not just
 

00:05:33.540 --> 00:05:35.090
to your application we're not just
talking about the physical the actual

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:35.100
talking about the physical the actual
 

00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.290
talking about the physical the actual
screen size anymore we're talking about

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:36.300
screen size anymore we're talking about
 

00:05:36.300 --> 00:05:37.700
screen size anymore we're talking about
what's actually available for your

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:37.710
what's actually available for your
 

00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:41.540
what's actually available for your
application great so do we need

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:41.550
application great so do we need
 

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:43.940
application great so do we need
resources for every combination and not

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:43.950
resources for every combination and not
 

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:48.350
resources for every combination and not
necessarily good question ok so the the

00:05:48.350 --> 00:05:48.360
necessarily good question ok so the the
 

00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:49.970
necessarily good question ok so the the
android framework actually takes care of

00:05:49.970 --> 00:05:49.980
android framework actually takes care of
 

00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.580
android framework actually takes care of
this for you so and it tries to take a

00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:52.590
this for you so and it tries to take a
 

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:55.100
this for you so and it tries to take a
good guess at what what are the best

00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:55.110
good guess at what what are the best
 

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:56.240
good guess at what what are the best
resources for you to use if you don't

00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:56.250
resources for you to use if you don't
 

00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:57.710
resources for you to use if you don't
specify the various single combination

00:05:57.710 --> 00:05:57.720
specify the various single combination
 

00:05:57.720 --> 00:06:00.230
specify the various single combination
so for example if you if you specify a

00:06:00.230 --> 00:06:00.240
so for example if you if you specify a
 

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.630
so for example if you if you specify a
phone layout and you specify a 7 inch

00:06:02.630 --> 00:06:02.640
phone layout and you specify a 7 inch
 

00:06:02.640 --> 00:06:05.570
phone layout and you specify a 7 inch
length using the 600 DP resource

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:05.580
length using the 600 DP resource
 

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.270
length using the 600 DP resource
qualifier and you'll certify a 10 inch

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:08.280
qualifier and you'll certify a 10 inch
 

00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.250
qualifier and you'll certify a 10 inch
layer you know a bigger tablet layout it

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:10.260
layer you know a bigger tablet layout it
 

00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:11.480
layer you know a bigger tablet layout it
would automatically pick the one that's

00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:11.490
would automatically pick the one that's
 

00:06:11.490 --> 00:06:13.850
would automatically pick the one that's
that goes for the 670 p for the 7 inch

00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:13.860
that goes for the 670 p for the 7 inch
 

00:06:13.860 --> 00:06:15.380
that goes for the 670 p for the 7 inch
tablet run so it's time to make a good

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:15.390
tablet run so it's time to make a good
 

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.480
tablet run so it's time to make a good
guess at what what's what's useful for

00:06:17.480 --> 00:06:17.490
guess at what what's what's useful for
 

00:06:17.490 --> 00:06:18.920
guess at what what's what's useful for
you and you can use it to your advantage

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:18.930
you and you can use it to your advantage
 

00:06:18.930 --> 00:06:20.870
you and you can use it to your advantage
right so and I think it's a good good

00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:20.880
right so and I think it's a good good
 

00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:23.690
right so and I think it's a good good
idea to look at how what what's specific

00:06:23.690 --> 00:06:23.700
idea to look at how what what's specific
 

00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:25.730
idea to look at how what what's specific
to some of your layouts on how you can

00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:25.740
to some of your layouts on how you can
 

00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.710
to some of your layouts on how you can
how you can trim down on the layouts and

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:27.720
how you can trim down on the layouts and
 

00:06:27.720 --> 00:06:29.659
how you can trim down on the layouts and
resources and images that you use yeah I

00:06:29.659 --> 00:06:29.669
resources and images that you use yeah I
 

00:06:29.669 --> 00:06:32.390
resources and images that you use yeah I
mean typically we can use the 10-inch

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:32.400
mean typically we can use the 10-inch
 

00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:36.140
mean typically we can use the 10-inch
qualifier which is 720 DP the 67 inch

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:36.150
qualifier which is 720 DP the 67 inch
 

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.430
qualifier which is 720 DP the 67 inch
qualifier which is 600 DP

00:06:38.430 --> 00:06:38.440
qualifier which is 600 DP
 

00:06:38.440 --> 00:06:40.590
qualifier which is 600 DP
and then just not putting a qualify

00:06:40.590 --> 00:06:40.600
and then just not putting a qualify
 

00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:42.120
and then just not putting a qualify
which is your fallback so you've got

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:42.130
which is your fallback so you've got
 

00:06:42.130 --> 00:06:47.040
which is your fallback so you've got
phone 7-inch tablets 10-inch tablets as

00:06:47.040 --> 00:06:47.050
phone 7-inch tablets 10-inch tablets as
 

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:50.040

well so they tend to cater for really

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:50.050
well so they tend to cater for really
 

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:52.080
well so they tend to cater for really
the bulk of the devices unless you're

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:52.090
the bulk of the devices unless you're
 

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:53.760
the bulk of the devices unless you're
going for something very specialized

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:53.770
going for something very specialized
 

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:55.650
going for something very specialized
which generally we don't recommend

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:55.660
which generally we don't recommend
 

00:06:55.660 --> 00:06:57.510
which generally we don't recommend
because you know maintainability becomes

00:06:57.510 --> 00:06:57.520
because you know maintainability becomes
 

00:06:57.520 --> 00:07:00.810

a more difficult but yes three buckets

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:00.820
a more difficult but yes three buckets

will get you very far that's right

00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:02.710
will get you very far that's right
 

00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:06.900
will get you very far that's right
that's right all right so uh so we

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910
that's right all right so uh so we
 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.150
that's right all right so uh so we
talked to tiny bit about designing for

00:07:09.150 --> 00:07:09.160
talked to tiny bit about designing for
 

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:10.920
talked to tiny bit about designing for
petrol independence in our series and

00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:10.930
petrol independence in our series and
 

00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:12.810
petrol independence in our series and
i'll be happy we had the nexus s we had

00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:12.820
i'll be happy we had the nexus s we had
 

00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.910
i'll be happy we had the nexus s we had
me we had a tablet layout we had a phone

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:14.920
me we had a tablet layout we had a phone
 

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:17.250
me we had a tablet layout we had a phone
layout them so so let's talk about bit

00:07:17.250 --> 00:07:17.260
layout them so so let's talk about bit
 

00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:19.560
layout them so so let's talk about bit
about this a bit more and so you have

00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:19.570
about this a bit more and so you have
 

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.810
about this a bit more and so you have
any good tips so when you want to design

00:07:21.810 --> 00:07:21.820
any good tips so when you want to design
 

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.580
any good tips so when you want to design
a layout you want design an app for

00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:23.590
a layout you want design an app for
 

00:07:23.590 --> 00:07:25.080
a layout you want design an app for
pleasure independence what are the key

00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:25.090
pleasure independence what are the key
 

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.370
pleasure independence what are the key
things you should pay attention to or

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:26.380
things you should pay attention to or
 

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.500
things you should pay attention to or
that you should do in your code yeah so

00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:28.510
that you should do in your code yeah so
 

00:07:28.510 --> 00:07:31.920
that you should do in your code yeah so
I so just to clarify by platform what we

00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:31.930
I so just to clarify by platform what we
 

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.050
I so just to clarify by platform what we
actually meant is device device

00:07:34.050 --> 00:07:34.060
actually meant is device device
 

00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:35.310
actually meant is device device
independence so we're not we're not

00:07:35.310 --> 00:07:35.320
independence so we're not we're not
 

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:37.680
independence so we're not we're not
linked to a particular device size but

00:07:37.680 --> 00:07:37.690
linked to a particular device size but
 

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:41.610
linked to a particular device size but
look when you're specifying a layout the

00:07:41.610 --> 00:07:41.620
look when you're specifying a layout the
 

00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:44.010
look when you're specifying a layout the
the obvious thing is used oops use

it's Nick butcher has some interesting

00:12:10.650 --> 00:12:10.660
it's Nick butcher has some interesting
 

00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:13.290
it's Nick butcher has some interesting
tips for his design bites he had a

00:12:13.290 --> 00:12:13.300
tips for his design bites he had a
 

00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:15.330

gridview in tablet and a listview on

00:12:15.330 --> 00:12:15.340
gridview in tablet and a listview on
 

00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.360
gridview in tablet and a listview on
phones how would I implement this is it

00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:18.370
phones how would I implement this is it
 

00:12:18.370 --> 00:12:19.650
phones how would I implement this is it
always a gridview just with different

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:19.660
always a gridview just with different
 

00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:21.990
always a gridview just with different
layouts or would I switch between the

00:12:21.990 --> 00:12:22.000
layouts or would I switch between the
 

00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.780
layouts or would I switch between the
two actually the options yours you could

00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:24.790
two actually the options yours you could
 

00:12:24.790 --> 00:12:26.340
two actually the options yours you could
just go with a single grid view that's

00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:26.350
just go with a single grid view that's
 

00:12:26.350 --> 00:12:29.550
just go with a single grid view that's
one column on funds and multi columns on

00:12:29.550 --> 00:12:29.560
one column on funds and multi columns on
 

00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:31.770
one column on funds and multi columns on
a tablet or you could switch them around

00:12:31.770 --> 00:12:31.780
a tablet or you could switch them around
 

00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:34.020
a tablet or you could switch them around
and basically what you would do is using

00:12:34.020 --> 00:12:34.030
and basically what you would do is using
 

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:37.350
and basically what you would do is using
those same resource qualifiers you could

00:12:37.350 --> 00:12:37.360
those same resource qualifiers you could
 

00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:39.060
those same resource qualifiers you could
have a value that indicated whether

00:12:39.060 --> 00:12:39.070
have a value that indicated whether
 

00:12:39.070 --> 00:12:40.740
have a value that indicated whether
you're in the grid view mode or the list

00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:40.750
you're in the grid view mode or the list
 

00:12:40.750 --> 00:12:43.170
you're in the grid view mode or the list
view mode and conditionally in your code

00:12:43.170 --> 00:12:43.180
view mode and conditionally in your code
 

00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:46.080
view mode and conditionally in your code
when you do a find nearby ID you would

00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:46.090
when you do a find nearby ID you would
 

00:12:46.090 --> 00:12:48.840
when you do a find nearby ID you would
cast them to the right type so actually

00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:48.850
cast them to the right type so actually
 

00:12:48.850 --> 00:12:51.330
cast them to the right type so actually
there is no right way to do it there's

00:12:51.330 --> 00:12:51.340
there is no right way to do it there's
 

00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:52.710
there is no right way to do it there's
multiple ways to do it which is always a

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:52.720
multiple ways to do it which is always a
 

00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.190
multiple ways to do it which is always a
good thing so yeah you could I mean it

00:12:56.190 --> 00:12:56.200
good thing so yeah you could I mean it
 

00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:58.380
good thing so yeah you could I mean it

00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:58.390
makes sense to use grid news on tablets
 

00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.450

you get on tablets okay so we had some

00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:10.630
you get on tablets okay so we had some
 

00:13:10.630 --> 00:13:13.890
you get on tablets okay so we had some
episodes on performance tuning and you

00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:13.900
episodes on performance tuning and you
 

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.720
episodes on performance tuning and you
know we we talked to in our episode a

00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:15.730
know we we talked to in our episode a
 

00:13:15.730 --> 00:13:16.360

little bit about

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:16.370
little bit about

00:13:27.740 --> 00:13:29.320
in our in our episode it makes a massive
difference to the performance of your

00:13:29.320 --> 00:13:29.330
difference to the performance of your
 

00:13:29.330 --> 00:13:31.480
difference to the performance of your
app and the experience as well and it

00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:31.490
app and the experience as well and it
 

00:13:31.490 --> 00:13:33.040
app and the experience as well and it
tries to do the right thing by holding

00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:33.050
tries to do the right thing by holding
 

00:13:33.050 --> 00:13:35.019
tries to do the right thing by holding
onto your images as long as possible so

00:13:35.019 --> 00:13:35.029
onto your images as long as possible so
 

00:13:35.029 --> 00:13:36.519
onto your images as long as possible so
the hard works done for you it's just a

00:13:36.519 --> 00:13:36.529
the hard works done for you it's just a
 

00:13:36.529 --> 00:13:39.220
the hard works done for you it's just a
matter of utilizing it yeah but there is

00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:39.230
matter of utilizing it yeah but there is
 

00:13:39.230 --> 00:13:40.810
matter of utilizing it yeah but there is
a there is some other libraries that you

00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:40.820
a there is some other libraries that you
 

00:13:40.820 --> 00:13:42.760
a there is some other libraries that you
can use to fetch yeah so so they didn't

00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:42.770
can use to fetch yeah so so they didn't
 

00:13:42.770 --> 00:13:44.140
can use to fetch yeah so so they didn't
talk in our series but they obviously

00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:44.150
talk in our series but they obviously
 

00:13:44.150 --> 00:13:45.820
talk in our series but they obviously
lots of other libraries you can use to

00:13:45.820 --> 00:13:45.830
lots of other libraries you can use to
 

00:13:45.830 --> 00:13:47.079
lots of other libraries you can use to
like fetch images through some

00:13:47.079 --> 00:13:47.089
like fetch images through some
 

00:13:47.089 --> 00:13:48.250
like fetch images through some
processing of the earth and all that

00:13:48.250 --> 00:13:48.260
processing of the earth and all that
 

00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:49.600
processing of the earth and all that
kind of stuff so you don't have to go

00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:49.610
kind of stuff so you don't have to go
 

00:13:49.610 --> 00:13:51.490
kind of stuff so you don't have to go
all of the work yourself every single

00:13:51.490 --> 00:13:51.500
all of the work yourself every single
 

00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.110
all of the work yourself every single
time you want to do something so one

00:13:53.110 --> 00:13:53.120
time you want to do something so one
 

00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:54.280
time you want to do something so one
really good library that we've been

00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:54.290
really good library that we've been
 

00:13:54.290 --> 00:13:56.200
really good library that we've been
using is called wally and there was a

00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:56.210
using is called wally and there was a
 

00:13:56.210 --> 00:13:58.000
using is called wally and there was a
talk at Google i/o this year that would

00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:58.010
talk at Google i/o this year that would
 

00:13:58.010 --> 00:13:59.590
talk at Google i/o this year that would
highly recommend for you guys to check

00:13:59.590 --> 00:13:59.600
highly recommend for you guys to check
 

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.050
highly recommend for you guys to check
out that's library that lets open source

00:14:02.050 --> 00:14:02.060
out that's library that lets open source
 

00:14:02.060 --> 00:14:03.640
out that's library that lets open source
and as part of them is part of the

00:14:03.640 --> 00:14:03.650
and as part of them is part of the
 

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:06.430
and as part of them is part of the
android framework as well yeah so we use

00:14:06.430 --> 00:14:06.440
android framework as well yeah so we use
 

00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:08.019
android framework as well yeah so we use
it extensively it's actually written by

00:14:08.019 --> 00:14:08.029
it extensively it's actually written by
 

00:14:08.029 --> 00:14:11.050
it extensively it's actually written by
a google of focus yeah and yeah it's

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:11.060
a google of focus yeah and yeah it's
 

00:14:11.060 --> 00:14:14.940
a google of focus yeah and yeah it's
great I mean it a synchronizes your your

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:14.950
great I mean it a synchronizes your your
 

00:14:14.950 --> 00:14:18.700
great I mean it a synchronizes your your
web requests yeah and so you can

00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:18.710
web requests yeah and so you can
 

00:14:18.710 --> 00:14:20.590
web requests yeah and so you can
basically have a very you spawn civ user

00:14:20.590 --> 00:14:20.600
basically have a very you spawn civ user
 

00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:23.140
basically have a very you spawn civ user
interface that brings images in the

00:14:23.140 --> 00:14:23.150
interface that brings images in the
 

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:24.640
interface that brings images in the
background for you yeah and so it

00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:24.650
background for you yeah and so it
 

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:26.530
background for you yeah and so it
actually it's very easy to use actually

00:14:26.530 --> 00:14:26.540
actually it's very easy to use actually
 

00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:28.420
actually it's very easy to use actually
you basically say here's an image here's

00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:28.430
you basically say here's an image here's
 

00:14:28.430 --> 00:14:30.310
you basically say here's an image here's
the URL here's the view i want to put it

00:14:30.310 --> 00:14:30.320
the URL here's the view i want to put it
 

00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:31.870
the URL here's the view i want to put it
and it goes off does it automatically

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:31.880
and it goes off does it automatically
 

00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:33.370
and it goes off does it automatically
and update anyone the right threatens

00:14:33.370 --> 00:14:33.380
and update anyone the right threatens

all of this kind of stuff for it which

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:34.370
all of this kind of stuff for it which
 

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:36.460
all of this kind of stuff for it which
is really handy and but you can also use

00:14:36.460 --> 00:14:36.470
is really handy and but you can also use
 

00:14:36.470 --> 00:14:38.320
is really handy and but you can also use
for other things not just images so if

00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:38.330
for other things not just images so if
 

00:14:38.330 --> 00:14:40.060
for other things not just images so if
for example built-in i think is support

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:40.070
for example built-in i think is support
 

00:14:40.070 --> 00:14:42.670
for example built-in i think is support
for Jason aslam so if there's some Jason

00:14:42.670 --> 00:14:42.680
for Jason aslam so if there's some Jason
 

00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:43.840

use the volume library for Dennis font
 

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.019
use the volume library for Dennis font
and it gives it back to JSON object in

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:47.029
and it gives it back to JSON object in
 

00:14:47.029 --> 00:14:48.940
and it gives it back to JSON object in
JSON array and its really really handy

00:14:48.940 --> 00:14:48.950
JSON array and its really really handy
 

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:50.620
JSON array and its really really handy
and you know they're all sorts of other

00:14:50.620 --> 00:14:50.630
and you know they're all sorts of other

having said that a lot of other
libraries out there as well that said

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:04.760
libraries out there as well that said
 

00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:06.670
libraries out there as well that said
that people are using these days as well

00:15:06.670 --> 00:15:06.680
that people are using these days as well
 

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.530

one of the last episodes that we did and
 

00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:41.730
one of the last episodes that we did and
that's that's part of the support

00:16:41.730 --> 00:16:41.740
that's that's part of the support
 

00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:44.820
that's that's part of the support
library as well isn't it it is you can

00:16:44.820 --> 00:16:44.830
library as well isn't it it is you can
 

00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:47.010
library as well isn't it it is you can
grab the classes you can just drop it in

00:16:47.010 --> 00:16:47.020
grab the classes you can just drop it in
 

00:16:47.020 --> 00:16:49.440
grab the classes you can just drop it in
and start using it the nice thing is we

00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:49.450
and start using it the nice thing is we
 

00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:51.030
and start using it the nice thing is we
talked about all of the subtleties that

00:16:51.030 --> 00:16:51.040
talked about all of the subtleties that
 

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:53.880
talked about all of the subtleties that
come with the the standardized android

you so using standard components is

00:17:06.390 --> 00:17:06.400
you so using standard components is
 

00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:07.860
you so using standard components is
always a good thing you don't have to

00:17:07.860 --> 00:17:07.870
always a good thing you don't have to
 

00:17:07.870 --> 00:17:08.970
always a good thing you don't have to
write it and paste the code yourself

00:17:08.970 --> 00:17:08.980
write it and paste the code yourself
 

00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:13.530
write it and paste the code yourself
that's right hmm okay the last thing I

00:17:13.530 --> 00:17:13.540
that's right hmm okay the last thing I
 

00:17:13.540 --> 00:17:15.240
that's right hmm okay the last thing I
think we should talk about we didn't

00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:15.250
think we should talk about we didn't
 

00:17:15.250 --> 00:17:16.830
think we should talk about we didn't
really talk about it is notifications

00:17:16.830 --> 00:17:16.840
really talk about it is notifications
 

00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.110
really talk about it is notifications
yeah so that's in the sucess a

00:17:19.110 --> 00:17:19.120
yeah so that's in the sucess a
 

00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:21.240
yeah so that's in the sucess a
notification compact in support drive as

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:21.250
notification compact in support drive as
 

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:24.480
notification compact in support drive as
well so in android for dot one jellybean

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:24.490
well so in android for dot one jellybean
 

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:26.820
well so in android for dot one jellybean
we introduced new types of notifications

00:17:26.820 --> 00:17:26.830
we introduced new types of notifications
 

00:17:26.830 --> 00:17:29.220
we introduced new types of notifications
you can have explained notifications so

00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:29.230
you can have explained notifications so
 

00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:30.480
you can have explained notifications so
you can display a different type of

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:30.490
you can display a different type of
 

00:17:30.490 --> 00:17:31.260
you can display a different type of
notification

00:17:31.260 --> 00:17:31.270
notification
 

00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:32.490
notification
painting on with it expanded not

00:17:32.490 --> 00:17:32.500
painting on with it expanded not
 

00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:34.560
painting on with it expanded not
expanded its really useful for email

00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:34.570
expanded its really useful for email
 

00:17:34.570 --> 00:17:36.750
expanded its really useful for email
messages for example so you can see all

00:17:36.750 --> 00:17:36.760
messages for example so you can see all
 

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:38.640
messages for example so you can see all
of you all of your emails in unification

00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:38.650
of you all of your emails in unification
 

00:17:38.650 --> 00:17:40.440
of you all of your emails in unification
list so you can minimize them only see

00:17:40.440 --> 00:17:40.450
list so you can minimize them only see
 

00:17:40.450 --> 00:17:41.520
list so you can minimize them only see
that you have you know some unread

00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:41.530
that you have you know some unread
 

00:17:41.530 --> 00:17:43.890
that you have you know some unread
messages and this this is something that

00:17:43.890 --> 00:17:43.900
messages and this this is something that
 

00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.080
messages and this this is something that
we have added to the notification compat

00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:46.090
we have added to the notification compat
 

00:17:46.090 --> 00:17:49.080
we have added to the notification compat
in the support library as well but the

00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:49.090
in the support library as well but the
 

00:17:49.090 --> 00:17:51.420
in the support library as well but the
problem here is that an expanded

00:17:51.420 --> 00:17:51.430
problem here is that an expanded
 

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.770

notifications are not backwards

00:17:52.770 --> 00:17:52.780
notifications are not backwards
 

00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.900
notifications are not backwards
compatible so if you if you use the

00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:54.910
compatible so if you if you use the
 

00:17:54.910 --> 00:17:56.490
compatible so if you if you use the
notification compat builder that's in

00:17:56.490 --> 00:17:56.500
notification compat builder that's in
 

00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:58.440
notification compat builder that's in
the support library you can add all of

00:17:58.440 --> 00:17:58.450
the support library you can add all of
 

00:17:58.450 --> 00:18:00.690
the support library you can add all of
these things to notification but it

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:00.700
these things to notification but it
 

00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.280
these things to notification but it
doesn't get displayed on lower versions

00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:02.290
doesn't get displayed on lower versions
 

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.080
doesn't get displayed on lower versions
of Android unfortunately and but the

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.090
of Android unfortunately and but the
 

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:05.610
of Android unfortunately and but the
good thing you for use its transparency

00:18:05.610 --> 00:18:05.620
good thing you for use its transparency
 

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:06.780
good thing you for use its transparency
you have to worry about version check

00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:06.790
you have to worry about version check
 

00:18:06.790 --> 00:18:08.190
you have to worry about version check
some of the kind of stuff is simply

00:18:08.190 --> 00:18:08.200
some of the kind of stuff is simply
 

00:18:08.200 --> 00:18:10.350

00:18:10.350 --> 00:18:10.360
isn't displayed and one really big hint
 

00:18:10.360 --> 00:18:13.050
isn't displayed and one really big hint
I I have though is that if you make use

00:18:13.050 --> 00:18:13.060
I I have though is that if you make use
 

00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:14.940
I I have though is that if you make use
of these experimental vacations or

00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:14.950
of these experimental vacations or
 

00:18:14.950 --> 00:18:16.590

notification actions you know you can

00:18:16.590 --> 00:18:16.600
notification actions you know you can
 

00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.880
notification actions you know you can
have buttons at the bottom of

00:18:17.880 --> 00:18:17.890
have buttons at the bottom of
 

00:18:17.890 --> 00:18:19.590
have buttons at the bottom of
notification so you can apply sort of a

00:18:19.590 --> 00:18:19.600
notification so you can apply sort of a

your course on my back straightaway make
 

00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:24.390
your course on my back straightaway make
sure you always supply a content intent

00:18:24.390 --> 00:18:24.400
sure you always supply a content intent
 

00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:26.430
sure you always supply a content intent
and the cotton intent is the one that's

00:18:26.430 --> 00:18:26.440
and the cotton intent is the one that's
 

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:28.260
and the cotton intent is the one that's

vacation and this is basically what's

00:18:30.270 --> 00:18:30.280
vacation and this is basically what's
 

00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:32.220
vacation and this is basically what's
get fired on lower version of android so

00:18:32.220 --> 00:18:32.230
get fired on lower version of android so
 

00:18:32.230 --> 00:18:33.630
get fired on lower version of android so
gingerbread for example we don't have

support for these extra identification
 

00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.680
support for these extra identification
actions right so it's always really

00:18:37.680 --> 00:18:37.690
actions right so it's always really
 

00:18:37.690 --> 00:18:39.780
actions right so it's always really
really important to specify the uniform

00:18:39.780 --> 00:18:39.790
