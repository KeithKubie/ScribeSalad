00:00:08.971 --> 00:00:12.013
- It's very complicated
with this body thing,

00:00:12.013 --> 00:00:13.479
how it all happened.

00:00:13.479 --> 00:00:16.195
I was painting as a young artist.

00:00:16.195 --> 00:00:18.535
And mostly I was painting these clouds.

00:00:18.535 --> 00:00:20.915
And one day, sitting and
painting and looking at the sky

00:00:20.915 --> 00:00:23.796
I saw 12 military planes passing by.

00:00:23.796 --> 00:00:26.016
And they made these incredible
drawings in the sky.

00:00:26.016 --> 00:00:27.137
And I looked at them and I said,

00:00:27.137 --> 00:00:30.578
"God, it's ridiculous. I'm
painting these paintings

00:00:30.578 --> 00:00:32.238
that are so two dimensional.

00:00:32.238 --> 00:00:35.079
Maybe I can go to the
military base and ask for

00:00:35.079 --> 00:00:37.939
12 planes and then make all
the drawings in the sky".

00:00:37.939 --> 00:00:39.370
I went to the military base,

00:00:39.370 --> 00:00:41.890
and my father was general in the army.

00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:43.272
So they call him and they say,

00:00:43.272 --> 00:00:44.970
"Your daughter is in our base.

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:47.272
"Can you get her home because
she's out of her mind.

00:00:47.272 --> 00:00:49.360
"She wants 12 military
planes to paint the sky.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.686
"How much could this cost?"

00:00:51.686 --> 00:00:54.080
So after that I stopped painting

00:00:54.080 --> 00:00:56.240
and I start realizing that I can use

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.471
any material I want:
fire, water and the body.

00:00:59.471 --> 00:01:01.472
At the moment when I start using the body

00:01:01.472 --> 00:01:05.233
it was such enormous
satisfaction that I had,

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.093
and that I can communicate
with the public,

00:01:07.093 --> 00:01:09.074
that I never could do anything else.

00:01:09.098 --> 00:01:11.895
I could never go back to
the seclusion of the studio

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:15.136
and be protected by the space there.

00:01:15.776 --> 00:01:18.096
The only way of expression is to perform.

00:01:18.096 --> 00:01:21.699
And if I put the kind of hierarchy of art

00:01:21.699 --> 00:01:25.231
I will always put definitely
the music on the top

00:01:25.231 --> 00:01:26.811
because it's so immaterial.

00:01:26.811 --> 00:01:28.971
And after this it will be performers.

00:01:28.971 --> 00:01:30.251
And then any other art.

00:01:30.251 --> 00:01:32.492
I mean, subject to point of view.
