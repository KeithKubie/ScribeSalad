00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:47.680
- Welcome to a conversation with history.

00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:48.920
I'm Harry Kreisler

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:51.220
of the Institute of International Studies.

00:00:51.220 --> 00:00:53.116
Our guest today is Didier Fassin,

00:00:53.116 --> 00:00:56.379
who is the James D. Wolfson professor

00:00:56.379 --> 00:00:59.130
at the School of Social Science

00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:02.260
at the Institute for Advanced Study

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:04.140
in Princeton, New Jersey.

00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:09.140
He is the 2016 Tanner
Lecturer at Berkeley.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:12.480
An anthropologist and a sociologist,

00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:14.339
he was trained as a physician

00:01:14.339 --> 00:01:17.860
in internal medicine and public health.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:21.015
His recent books include
The Empire of Trauma,

00:01:21.015 --> 00:01:24.185
an Inquiry into the
Condition of Victimhood,

00:01:24.185 --> 00:01:27.888
Humanitarian Reason, a Moral
History of the Present,

00:01:27.888 --> 00:01:32.753
Enforcing Order, an
Ethnography of Urban Policing,

00:01:32.753 --> 00:01:37.753
At the Heart of the State, the
Moral World of Institutions.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:41.026
His new book, in press, is entitled

00:01:41.026 --> 00:01:46.026
Prison Worlds, an Ethnography
of the Carceral World.

00:01:48.270 --> 00:01:50.480
Didier, welcome to our program.

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:51.360
- Thank you.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:53.367
- Where were you born and raised?

00:01:53.367 --> 00:01:57.130
- I was born and raised south of Paris

00:01:57.130 --> 00:01:59.793
in the outskirts of the French capital.

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:06.270
I spent my childhood and
adolescence in a housing project.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:15.350
My parents were, my mother a secretary

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:20.350
and my father, blue collar
worker in a car factory.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:24.720
- And looking back, how did your parents

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:26.563
shape your thinking about the world?

00:02:28.380 --> 00:02:30.140
- I think my father in particular

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:36.680
had a sense of duty, of righteousness.

00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:48.733
And he was absolutely not an intellectual,

00:02:51.082 --> 00:02:52.043
neither my mother was.

00:02:54.287 --> 00:02:57.350
But they both had this principle

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:59.813
that you find in working class families,

00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:05.920
where you have to work on
meritocracy principles.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.390
- And when you say a housing project,

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.210
was it one where there were
minorities and immigrants?

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:16.043
- Absolutely.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:20.420
But the difference with
the housing projects

00:03:20.420 --> 00:03:25.420
as they are now is, at that
time, they were more mixed.

00:03:26.297 --> 00:03:31.185
So they were all working
class people, low income,

00:03:31.185 --> 00:03:36.185
but you would find French
as well as immigrants.

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.620
And this is the surroundings

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:46.620
and the friends I had when I was a kid.

00:03:51.010 --> 00:03:54.260
- And what imbued you with the ethos

00:03:54.260 --> 00:03:56.653
of education and training?

00:04:02.365 --> 00:04:05.070
- Well, I would say
that there was not much

00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:15.140
in this working class
housing project environment

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:22.300
and school was a way to escape that

00:04:22.380 --> 00:04:24.820
through the studies, but also through

00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:29.720
the possibilities of, perhaps,
doing something different.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:34.720
And I remember that, for my parents,

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:38.750
and probably they told me
that when I was a child,

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.770
or maybe a little later,

00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:44.915
that for them, having a child,

00:04:44.915 --> 00:04:49.071
a son who would be a physician,

00:04:49.071 --> 00:04:52.810
was something that was
simply impossible to imagine,

00:04:52.810 --> 00:04:57.007
because it seems such
a distant social world.

00:05:00.925 --> 00:05:05.925
So yes, I think the school was this place

00:05:05.952 --> 00:05:10.952
where you could move from
one world to another.

00:05:12.010 --> 00:05:16.330
- And your first career, shall
we say, was as a physician.

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:18.400
So you went to medical school.

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.081
- I went to medical school.

00:05:20.081 --> 00:05:25.081
And I had decided to study medicine

00:05:26.722 --> 00:05:31.722
at the time of the
liberation war of Bangladesh.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.030
That's one of the first moments

00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:42.633
when we had, in 1971, 1972,

00:05:45.340 --> 00:05:49.930
on television, you
would see the situations

00:05:49.930 --> 00:05:54.930
of the Bangladeshi, and the
intervention of the Indian Army.

00:05:56.386 --> 00:06:01.386
So this is when I decided
to study medicine,

00:06:03.526 --> 00:06:06.974
with the idea that I would
perhaps, at some point,

00:06:06.974 --> 00:06:11.966
go abroad and do some
work in other countries.

00:06:11.966 --> 00:06:13.940
- Is this common in France,

00:06:13.940 --> 00:06:16.204
or was this unique to your career,

00:06:16.204 --> 00:06:19.385
the notion that you
would apply these skills

00:06:19.385 --> 00:06:22.480
in worldwide humanitarian work?

00:06:22.480 --> 00:06:25.269
- Well, at the time, it was,

00:06:25.269 --> 00:06:27.290
it was certainly not common,

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.740
but there was a minority that

00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.449
came out almost in that same period,

00:06:37.449 --> 00:06:42.449
that's the famous Doctors Without Borders.

00:06:47.108 --> 00:06:52.033
So my case was certainly not unique,

00:06:55.685 --> 00:06:58.680
but in my class at the faculty of medicine

00:07:01.203 --> 00:07:04.117
at the University of Paris,

00:07:04.117 --> 00:07:09.117
I didn't know any other friend or student

00:07:09.957 --> 00:07:14.780
who had this view for his future.

00:07:14.780 --> 00:07:17.910
- So, in your career in medicine,

00:07:17.910 --> 00:07:20.603
you essentially became a doctor

00:07:20.603 --> 00:07:23.940
with a constituency that was worldwide.

00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:26.173
So first you went to Bangladesh.

00:07:27.548 --> 00:07:30.950
- So when I became a physician,

00:07:30.950 --> 00:07:35.950
I did what my colleagues
at the time were doing,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:41.390
except that I had taken a test

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:45.620
to remain in public hospitals.

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.250
So I worked in public hospitals in France.

00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:51.961
I became a specialist in internal medicine

00:07:51.961 --> 00:07:55.317
and infectious diseases.

00:07:55.317 --> 00:07:59.357
And at some point, I had the opportunity,

00:07:59.357 --> 00:08:02.870
before doing my civil service,

00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:05.313
which, for physicians, can replace,

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:09.200
could, at the time,
replace military service,

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.390
so my civil service I did in Tunisia,

00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.611
but before that, I went to Calcutta,

00:08:15.611 --> 00:08:20.190
where I worked as the physician

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:22.990
in charge of the Home
for Dying Destitutes.

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.302
So I started in a very banal way,

00:08:27.302 --> 00:08:29.891
being in a public hospital,

00:08:29.891 --> 00:08:32.701
being an intern and then resident.

00:08:32.701 --> 00:08:35.260
And at some point there
was this bifurcation

00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.080
that was opened to me, of
doing what I had wanted

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:41.100
to do when I started medicine.

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:45.263
So part of my work as a physician,

00:08:45.263 --> 00:08:47.550
a good part of it, has been working

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:50.000
in France in public hospitals,

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.551
and at some point doing
some international work,

00:08:54.551 --> 00:08:59.551
mostly in these two
countries, India and Tunisia.

00:09:01.230 --> 00:09:04.059
- And later, really, all over the world,

00:09:04.059 --> 00:09:06.313
on different continents.

00:09:09.569 --> 00:09:11.869
- So, later, after I
became an anthropologist,

00:09:15.368 --> 00:09:18.781
and a social scientist,

00:09:18.781 --> 00:09:23.781
I returned to medicine
in two different ways.

00:09:25.010 --> 00:09:30.010
First, I created and
became the coordinator

00:09:30.774 --> 00:09:34.860
for several years of a socio-medical unit

00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.426
in a public hospital near Paris,

00:09:37.426 --> 00:09:40.677
in an area where there
were a lot of immigrants,

00:09:40.677 --> 00:09:42.639
some of them being undocumented,

00:09:42.639 --> 00:09:44.973
and so having no medical insurance.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:50.813
And so I opened this unit
to take care of their

00:09:50.813 --> 00:09:55.403
medical, social, and even legal problems.

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:00.150
And so that's one thing.

00:10:00.150 --> 00:10:04.187
And the other one is
that I became involved,

00:10:04.187 --> 00:10:07.760
I had been, for a long time,

00:10:07.760 --> 00:10:09.807
with different
non-governmental organizations,

00:10:09.807 --> 00:10:13.731
including Doctors of the World,

00:10:13.731 --> 00:10:18.131
which was a dissident branch
of Doctors Without Borders,

00:10:18.131 --> 00:10:20.198
but at some point I was asked to join

00:10:20.198 --> 00:10:23.808
the administration board and later become

00:10:23.808 --> 00:10:27.419
vice president of Doctors Without Borders.

00:10:27.419 --> 00:10:32.191
But at that time, I was a
professor at the university,

00:10:32.191 --> 00:10:36.394
so I was not going in the field

00:10:36.394 --> 00:10:38.670
as much as I had done before.

00:10:38.670 --> 00:10:43.670
So I was more contributing to the politics

00:10:44.010 --> 00:10:45.890
and the reflection around the politics

00:10:45.890 --> 00:10:47.780
of the humanitarian organization.

00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.420
- Now from medicine, I surmise that,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:54.807
and this is a guess, so correct me,

00:10:54.807 --> 00:10:59.807
that you honed your skills in
terms of listening to people,

00:11:00.078 --> 00:11:02.888
to their case studies, and I guess

00:11:02.888 --> 00:11:07.888
you became aware, I suspect,

00:11:08.611 --> 00:11:12.170
of the relationship of their story,

00:11:12.170 --> 00:11:14.602
their biography, what you
were learning in the consult,

00:11:14.602 --> 00:11:18.724
and the relationship to the body, really,

00:11:18.724 --> 00:11:23.724
a sense of the body as separate from that.

00:11:23.762 --> 00:11:25.620
- Yeah.

00:11:25.620 --> 00:11:29.660
I have really enjoyed the time

00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:34.660
when I was involved in clinical medicine.

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:39.331
I like the relationship
you had with people,

00:11:39.331 --> 00:11:44.331
especially toward the
end of my medical career.

00:11:44.695 --> 00:11:49.695
Because I was working with
these undocumented immigrants.

00:11:49.966 --> 00:11:53.570
And we had more time to spend with them,

00:11:53.570 --> 00:11:56.270
to understand their problems.

00:11:56.270 --> 00:11:59.033
But more generally, I think
that, most of the time,

00:11:59.033 --> 00:12:04.033
we don't get very deep
in the personal histories

00:12:07.009 --> 00:12:11.830
and the social context of the patient

00:12:11.830 --> 00:12:13.490
that we have in clinical medicine.

00:12:13.490 --> 00:12:18.490
In fact, I did a study of 100
cases in the emergency room,

00:12:23.623 --> 00:12:27.884
and there was not one case in which

00:12:27.884 --> 00:12:30.903
the social context of
the person had been asked

00:12:30.903 --> 00:12:34.730
in the public hospital
where I did this study.

00:12:34.730 --> 00:12:37.270
And I think that's very revealing of

00:12:37.270 --> 00:12:40.075
an interaction which is very much

00:12:40.075 --> 00:12:45.075
concentrated on the body, as you said,

00:12:45.079 --> 00:12:48.724
examining it, finding the symptoms

00:12:48.724 --> 00:12:52.555
and signs that will lead you

00:12:52.555 --> 00:12:56.050
to a diagnosis and perhaps treatment.

00:12:56.050 --> 00:13:01.050
So this personal, deeper interaction

00:13:02.064 --> 00:13:07.064
is something that I didn't
really find with medicine.

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:11.840
I found it, but at a
very superficial level.

00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:15.340
- And at some point, do you then decide

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.440
that you need to do more in your education

00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:23.440
in terms of theoretical, and in terms

00:13:24.309 --> 00:13:27.950
of anthropology and ethnography?

00:13:27.950 --> 00:13:32.950
- Well I think that it came
with my experience of going to

00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:39.690
India and then Tunisia,
but India in particular.

00:13:39.690 --> 00:13:43.580
And this encounter with a different world,

00:13:43.580 --> 00:13:47.192
which I had no experience of before,

00:13:47.192 --> 00:13:52.192
was marked by, I think
retrospectively, by two elements.

00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.616
One is the extreme inequality that

00:13:58.616 --> 00:14:01.751
you find in a city like Calcutta.

00:14:01.751 --> 00:14:05.930
And it is very puzzling to see the gap

00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:10.930
between the wealthy and
very very poor people.

00:14:11.236 --> 00:14:16.236
And the other one was this vibrant culture

00:14:17.192 --> 00:14:22.192
that was so different
from Western culture.

00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.618
So I think this combination
of inequality and culture

00:14:27.618 --> 00:14:32.618
brought me to a form
of, well, a questioning,

00:14:32.633 --> 00:14:35.410
which I realized afterwards,

00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:37.428
I didn't even know the word anthropology,

00:14:37.428 --> 00:14:42.428
which I realized could find some answers

00:14:42.815 --> 00:14:46.560
by studying the social science.

00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:51.560
And in France, we have an intellectual

00:14:51.710 --> 00:14:54.182
tradition in social
science in which we don't

00:14:54.182 --> 00:14:58.360
separate sociology and
anthropology very much.

00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.580
So I was, in fact, a
professor of sociology,

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:03.261
and I was a director of
studies in anthropology.

00:15:03.261 --> 00:15:08.220
And so, that helped to
make this combination

00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.920
between what I found interesting
in different cultures,

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:17.088
and what I found so important

00:15:17.088 --> 00:15:19.123
to understand about inequality.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.700
- You are an ethnographer on the one hand,

00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:26.213
but you also seem to be a theorist.

00:15:27.365 --> 00:15:29.466
And I like to ask my guests

00:15:29.466 --> 00:15:32.717
the skills and temperament that they think

00:15:32.717 --> 00:15:35.585
are involved in the work they do.

00:15:35.585 --> 00:15:40.585
What are really important
skills for the ethnographer.

00:15:43.469 --> 00:15:48.077
For the ethnographer,
I think what is needed

00:15:48.077 --> 00:15:53.077
is, first of all,
obviously, a deep interest

00:15:57.458 --> 00:16:01.530
in the worlds that you study

00:16:01.530 --> 00:16:03.543
and the people who inhabit these worlds.

00:16:04.993 --> 00:16:09.993
That's, I think, both the motivation and,

00:16:10.299 --> 00:16:13.070
I don't know if it's a skill,

00:16:13.070 --> 00:16:17.163
but at least a competence
that you should have.

00:16:18.350 --> 00:16:21.653
Then what is extremely
important is the humility.

00:16:25.496 --> 00:16:29.080
When you do an ethnography, you come into

00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:31.858
the lives of people who have never asked

00:16:31.858 --> 00:16:36.858
to have someone getting
in their existence.

00:16:42.273 --> 00:16:45.963
So you have to be very available for them,

00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:50.040
and sometimes, that happened to me

00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:54.453
in my work in Ecuador for
example, or South Africa,

00:16:56.193 --> 00:17:00.240
people would let you wait for half a day

00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:03.298
before spending some time with you.

00:17:03.298 --> 00:17:08.298
And this experience of understanding that

00:17:09.335 --> 00:17:14.335
you have to be open to the moments

00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:22.523
when people want to give
you some of their time,

00:17:24.490 --> 00:17:27.643
so I think these are two qualities

00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:36.020
or elements that are needed.

00:17:36.020 --> 00:17:39.380
Patience is also something
that is important,

00:17:39.380 --> 00:17:42.900
because ethnography is really based

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:46.504
on duration, on spending time.

00:17:46.504 --> 00:17:48.965
It's completely different from

00:17:48.965 --> 00:17:51.391
doing interviews, for example.

00:17:51.391 --> 00:17:52.530
- [Harry] Or journalism.

00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:54.166
- Or journalism, of course.

00:17:54.166 --> 00:17:56.105
I've been working on the police,

00:17:56.105 --> 00:17:59.402
and I spent 16 months studying

00:17:59.402 --> 00:18:03.960
police units in a specific area.

00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:08.528
I didn't do a study of the whole country.

00:18:08.528 --> 00:18:11.580
Whereas journalists working, some of them

00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:14.646
working on the same topic,

00:18:14.646 --> 00:18:17.160
would spend one night with the police

00:18:17.160 --> 00:18:18.870
and then do an article.

00:18:18.870 --> 00:18:21.984
So they're different jobs,

00:18:21.984 --> 00:18:26.793
different practice and
different ethos, I think.

00:18:28.210 --> 00:18:30.296
- There also seems to be an element

00:18:30.296 --> 00:18:33.779
of sympathy here, and a respect

00:18:33.779 --> 00:18:38.779
for the integrity of the culture

00:18:39.224 --> 00:18:41.530
that you're immersing yourself in.

00:18:41.530 --> 00:18:42.820
Is that fair?

00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:43.770
- Yeah, absolutely.

00:18:47.275 --> 00:18:49.963
You have to be curious about,

00:18:52.012 --> 00:18:56.883
genuinely curious, so
you don't come with your

00:18:57.906 --> 00:19:02.540
opinions that you would impose.

00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.470
So even if you disagree with what people

00:19:04.470 --> 00:19:07.480
say or think, or the way they act,

00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:11.840
this is not something that
you have to put forward.

00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:15.710
You have to try to understand, really.

00:19:15.710 --> 00:19:19.441
And you have to respect,
individually also,

00:19:19.441 --> 00:19:22.599
to respect the persons they are.

00:19:22.599 --> 00:19:27.599
And of course, it is
often relatively easy,

00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:32.700
because, especially if you
do, like I've been doing,

00:19:33.280 --> 00:19:37.959
work with people who are
in difficult situations,

00:19:37.959 --> 00:19:39.630
because they are asylum seekers,

00:19:39.630 --> 00:19:41.090
because they are undocumented immigrants,

00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:44.623
because they are AIDS
patients or AIDS orphans.

00:19:44.623 --> 00:19:48.408
But it becomes a little more difficult

00:19:48.408 --> 00:19:52.920
when you deal with people who are,

00:19:52.920 --> 00:19:54.663
for example, police officers.

00:19:55.509 --> 00:20:00.509
And still, you need to have this sympathy,

00:20:00.570 --> 00:20:04.343
which does not mean that you
will approve of what they do.

00:20:07.952 --> 00:20:12.952
But still, you have to have to try to have

00:20:13.960 --> 00:20:18.960
this understanding and this neutrality

00:20:19.750 --> 00:20:24.350
at the same time, with what you see.

00:20:24.350 --> 00:20:27.010
- And you're listening,

00:20:27.010 --> 00:20:30.870
you're questioning, you're being present.

00:20:30.870 --> 00:20:32.610
And when I say questioning,

00:20:32.610 --> 00:20:34.063
you're not being adversarial,

00:20:35.421 --> 00:20:39.660
you're really trying to figure
out, it's like a puzzle.

00:20:39.660 --> 00:20:42.970
You're trying to figure
out what's going on here,

00:20:42.970 --> 00:20:46.543
what motivates this cop on, you know,

00:20:46.543 --> 00:20:50.433
this part of this crime squad.

00:20:53.115 --> 00:20:53.948
- Yeah.

00:20:53.948 --> 00:20:57.143
Yeah, as you say, puzzled in a metaphor

00:20:57.143 --> 00:21:00.661
that I use, taking it from Georges Perec,

00:21:00.661 --> 00:21:05.493
his book, Life A User's Manual.

00:21:07.923 --> 00:21:09.360
And yes, the work with the police

00:21:14.976 --> 00:21:19.976
is consisted, as
ethnography more generally,

00:21:21.129 --> 00:21:25.111
really, first of all, in a presence.

00:21:25.111 --> 00:21:29.380
And trying to be as discrete as possible,

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:33.064
not to interfere with their
interactions with the public,

00:21:33.064 --> 00:21:38.064
not to comment on what
would have happened,

00:21:41.307 --> 00:21:46.307
or to comment, at least,
in a questioning way,

00:21:47.344 --> 00:21:50.677
asking why did things happen this way,

00:21:50.677 --> 00:21:54.170
rather than appearing to be judgemental,

00:21:54.170 --> 00:21:56.973
because then, people close themselves.

00:21:59.121 --> 00:22:04.121
So yeah, it is this puzzle
that you try to reconstitute

00:22:06.269 --> 00:22:11.269
through this long time when,

00:22:11.482 --> 00:22:16.482
in the work with the
police, my main experience,

00:22:16.486 --> 00:22:20.421
which I realized, after a long time,

00:22:20.421 --> 00:22:25.147
that was a shared experience
with the police, was boredom.

00:22:25.147 --> 00:22:27.120
Nothing happened most of the time.

00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:31.910
And so, what does it
mean for police officers

00:22:34.702 --> 00:22:38.962
who are supposed to be
in action all the time,

00:22:38.962 --> 00:22:43.688
arresting thugs, as they say, and thieves,

00:22:43.688 --> 00:22:48.688
to be in the car or to
be walking in the street

00:22:50.620 --> 00:22:54.264
and having nothing to do
except trying to look around?

00:22:54.264 --> 00:22:59.264
So this, ethnography for
me is, of course, a method,

00:23:01.288 --> 00:23:05.085
where you spend this long
period of time with people.

00:23:05.085 --> 00:23:10.085
But it's also an experience
that you share with the people,

00:23:11.950 --> 00:23:14.535
and this experience is extremely important

00:23:14.535 --> 00:23:18.010
for the last dimension of ethnography,

00:23:18.010 --> 00:23:20.280
which, etymologically, is writing.

00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.310
So ethnography is about writing also.

00:23:22.310 --> 00:23:24.671
And the writing moment is, I think,

00:23:24.671 --> 00:23:29.671
as important as the work
you've been doing in the field.

00:23:30.337 --> 00:23:34.946
- And I'm curious about that, and that is,

00:23:34.946 --> 00:23:39.946
you go out with the police, you come home,

00:23:40.390 --> 00:23:43.230
and then you do your notes?

00:23:43.230 --> 00:23:46.170
Or are you taking notes as you're

00:23:46.170 --> 00:23:48.210
going around with the police?

00:23:48.210 --> 00:23:50.770
- No, I could not record.

00:23:50.770 --> 00:23:55.770
That was, I would have liked
to, but that was impossible.

00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:59.630
- By record, you mean a tape recorder?

00:23:59.630 --> 00:24:00.700
- With a tape recorder.

00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.480
So I was not allowed to have one,

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:03.873
and I didn't cheat on that.

00:24:05.360 --> 00:24:09.833
And I could not, or I would not,

00:24:09.833 --> 00:24:14.833
take notes while being in the car,

00:24:15.250 --> 00:24:17.790
because that would have put me

00:24:17.790 --> 00:24:19.813
in a different position with the police.

00:24:20.862 --> 00:24:23.533
If people are speaking
and you're taking notes,

00:24:23.533 --> 00:24:25.837
it puts them on the defensive, in a way.

00:24:29.349 --> 00:24:32.682
And I prefer to try to let them be like,

00:24:36.118 --> 00:24:41.118
as much as possible, as
if I were not present.

00:24:42.130 --> 00:24:43.770
Of course, I know that I was,

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:46.938
I know that some things, for example,

00:24:46.938 --> 00:24:49.440
physical violence, would not happen

00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:52.174
because I was present most of the time.

00:24:52.174 --> 00:24:56.447
But at least I tried to avoid this

00:24:56.447 --> 00:25:01.447
too obvious presence of the researcher

00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:05.886
who is writing while people,

00:25:05.886 --> 00:25:08.100
so I had this conversation with them,

00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.750
and when I was back home,

00:25:11.750 --> 00:25:14.590
I would immediately start to write.

00:25:14.590 --> 00:25:19.130
That's what I did with my
work on the prison also.

00:25:19.130 --> 00:25:23.161
I would rarely take notes.

00:25:23.161 --> 00:25:26.020
I did sometimes, in the prison,

00:25:26.020 --> 00:25:28.890
because the spaces were different,

00:25:28.890 --> 00:25:31.939
but in the car with the
police I didn't do that.

00:25:31.939 --> 00:25:33.950
- We'll go back to writing in a minute,

00:25:33.950 --> 00:25:35.780
but I did wanna pick up one other element.

00:25:35.780 --> 00:25:38.150
In your new book, you talk about

00:25:38.150 --> 00:25:42.950
the multidimensional
perspective of your work.

00:25:42.950 --> 00:25:44.570
Talk to us about that, 'cause that means

00:25:44.570 --> 00:25:47.229
you're not just following
the officer on the beat

00:25:47.229 --> 00:25:49.075
or the officer in the squad car.

00:25:49.075 --> 00:25:51.188
You're talking to their superiors,

00:25:51.188 --> 00:25:53.719
you're talking to their
administrators, and so on.

00:25:53.719 --> 00:25:57.051
- Yeah, so I think ethnography gives us

00:25:57.051 --> 00:26:02.051
a very unique approach
of certain social worlds,

00:26:04.010 --> 00:26:06.210
like the one of the police,
the one of the prison,

00:26:06.210 --> 00:26:10.298
or the one of disaster victims,

00:26:10.298 --> 00:26:14.071
as I have done in the past.

00:26:14.071 --> 00:26:17.241
But it is never sufficient,
or it should not.

00:26:17.241 --> 00:26:22.241
I'm not, although I've been
influenced by interactionism,

00:26:22.870 --> 00:26:24.700
but I'm not an interactionist in the sense

00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:28.185
that I don't think that, although they

00:26:28.185 --> 00:26:30.010
would not say it exactly in this way,

00:26:30.010 --> 00:26:35.010
but everything is played in
the moment of the interaction.

00:26:36.347 --> 00:26:41.347
I like to, first of all, to
multiply the perspectives,

00:26:41.885 --> 00:26:45.937
the perspectives from other people

00:26:45.937 --> 00:26:50.937
in their immediate environment,

00:26:51.045 --> 00:26:53.228
like their superiors, but also

00:26:53.228 --> 00:26:56.455
inhabitants of the neighborhoods

00:26:56.455 --> 00:26:59.358
where the police intervene.

00:26:59.358 --> 00:27:04.358
And then I try to inscribe or interpret

00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.961
these local scenes and these,

00:27:07.961 --> 00:27:12.129
the life of these institutions,

00:27:12.129 --> 00:27:17.129
in a broader framework or background,

00:27:17.609 --> 00:27:20.150
which is both historical and political.

00:27:20.150 --> 00:27:22.369
And I try to, for example, to understand

00:27:22.369 --> 00:27:25.794
the evolution of the
police or the prison system

00:27:25.794 --> 00:27:29.114
in France over the years.

00:27:29.114 --> 00:27:34.114
I try to understand the composition,

00:27:36.591 --> 00:27:39.310
the socio-demographic composition of,

00:27:39.310 --> 00:27:40.720
who are the police officers?

00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.890
Who are the correctional officers?

00:27:42.890 --> 00:27:46.431
Because this is very indicative and very

00:27:46.431 --> 00:27:49.658
essential to the understanding of

00:27:49.658 --> 00:27:52.630
why they act the way they act.

00:27:52.630 --> 00:27:55.289
- So this is the other hat that you wear,

00:27:55.289 --> 00:27:58.380
and I'll call it a theorist, basically,

00:27:58.380 --> 00:28:01.234
'cause what you're bringing is history,

00:28:01.234 --> 00:28:05.750
sociology, anthropology, to step back.

00:28:05.750 --> 00:28:10.030
And you write somewhere
that you see yourself

00:28:10.030 --> 00:28:14.380
operating at the frontier
between inside and outside.

00:28:14.380 --> 00:28:17.859
So wearing this new hat, it is incumbent

00:28:17.859 --> 00:28:21.505
upon you to be detached, in a way,

00:28:21.505 --> 00:28:26.140
and to become the scholar of how we

00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:29.005
got to a particular
place, with the police,

00:28:29.005 --> 00:28:33.405
with humanitarianism, with the prisons,

00:28:33.405 --> 00:28:38.405
in order to give a fuller
picture of what this means.

00:28:39.670 --> 00:28:42.760
Because you're coming to an understanding

00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:44.864
that the people who are the actors

00:28:44.864 --> 00:28:47.999
in the situation, the police, the prisons,

00:28:47.999 --> 00:28:49.563
they may not understand.

00:28:50.638 --> 00:28:52.850
- Absolutely.

00:28:52.850 --> 00:28:56.927
So the idea of the threshold of the cave,

00:28:56.927 --> 00:29:01.129
which is, of course, Plato's Cave,

00:29:01.129 --> 00:29:05.808
Michael Walzer, in his book
The Company of Critics,

00:29:05.808 --> 00:29:09.210
who is, Michael Walzer,
who is my colleague

00:29:09.210 --> 00:29:11.544
at the Institute for Advanced Study,

00:29:11.544 --> 00:29:16.544
uses this metaphor to
oppose the intellectuals

00:29:16.791 --> 00:29:20.123
or thinkers or theorists who are

00:29:20.123 --> 00:29:24.268
outside the cave, and look at the world,

00:29:24.268 --> 00:29:29.268
at the illusions that
people have within the cave,

00:29:29.586 --> 00:29:34.586
whereas others, and he counts
himself as one of them,

00:29:34.787 --> 00:29:38.107
try to be close to the people

00:29:38.107 --> 00:29:42.650
and try to understand them
and their contradictions,

00:29:42.650 --> 00:29:44.930
and their dilemmas, et cetera.

00:29:44.930 --> 00:29:48.429
And what I've proposed to
do and what I've tried to do

00:29:48.429 --> 00:29:52.492
is, and that had been a very intense

00:29:52.492 --> 00:29:57.492
debate in France, between Pierre Bordieu,

00:29:57.620 --> 00:30:02.206
who was on the outside of the cave,

00:30:02.206 --> 00:30:06.270
to use this allegory, and Luc Boltanski,

00:30:06.270 --> 00:30:09.703
a student who was rather inside,

00:30:10.848 --> 00:30:15.435
and I thought that being on the threshold

00:30:15.435 --> 00:30:20.435
was not only a way to avoid this debate,

00:30:21.230 --> 00:30:24.420
but precisely to show
that, as an ethnographer,

00:30:24.420 --> 00:30:26.840
you have to be with the people,

00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:29.391
you have to try to understand them,

00:30:29.391 --> 00:30:31.666
and you have to be honest about

00:30:31.666 --> 00:30:36.666
how much you owe them in your
comprehension of the world,

00:30:37.715 --> 00:30:42.452
and how much you must recognize

00:30:42.452 --> 00:30:46.060
their intelligence of the world,

00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:48.617
how they understand the
world in which they are,

00:30:48.617 --> 00:30:52.080
and help you understand.

00:30:52.080 --> 00:30:55.280
But this is not sufficient,

00:30:55.280 --> 00:31:00.280
because people are
blind on certain things,

00:31:01.446 --> 00:31:06.446
they may want to avoid
seeing certain things

00:31:07.065 --> 00:31:12.065
or understanding certain logics of their,

00:31:12.231 --> 00:31:15.363
of what they do and why they do it.

00:31:16.272 --> 00:31:20.358
And moving outside the cave is a way

00:31:20.358 --> 00:31:25.358
to bring a critical, broader perspective

00:31:28.450 --> 00:31:31.380
on things that escape them,

00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:36.380
as they would escape any of
us when we are in our world.

00:31:39.010 --> 00:31:42.522
So it's this combination of
moving inside and outside

00:31:42.522 --> 00:31:47.154
that I try to do, and theory,
in particular critical theory

00:31:47.154 --> 00:31:51.200
is, I think, a way to do it,

00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:54.720
and also to, for me, critical theory

00:31:54.720 --> 00:31:59.347
is also a way to find larger issues

00:32:01.968 --> 00:32:06.968
in the transformation of
contemporary societies.

00:32:09.170 --> 00:32:14.170
- And in all of these areas that you work,

00:32:14.897 --> 00:32:17.930
what you find by putting this together,

00:32:17.930 --> 00:32:19.994
the ethnography on the one hand,

00:32:19.994 --> 00:32:23.500
the theory and history and
sociology on the other,

00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:28.500
is that what people think is going on

00:32:28.562 --> 00:32:31.430
isn't actually going on,

00:32:31.430 --> 00:32:34.495
or if they set a set of moral standards

00:32:34.495 --> 00:32:36.700
for what they're doing,

00:32:36.700 --> 00:32:41.070
this mix of ethnography and theory

00:32:41.070 --> 00:32:42.924
leads you often to a conclusion

00:32:42.924 --> 00:32:45.550
that something else is going on.

00:32:45.550 --> 00:32:48.322
And often what is at work here

00:32:48.322 --> 00:32:53.322
is a hidden inequality, shall we say.

00:32:53.535 --> 00:32:55.053
- Absolutely.

00:32:59.270 --> 00:33:03.887
I think one of the ways I use theory,

00:33:06.568 --> 00:33:10.133
and, in a sense, anthropology as such,

00:33:14.735 --> 00:33:17.400
is the capacity to be surprised,

00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:22.003
to be astonished by what we
usually take for granted.

00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:24.940
What we take for granted,

00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.410
in particular, in moral dimensions,

00:33:29.410 --> 00:33:31.256
or what we think is good,
what we think is bad.

00:33:31.256 --> 00:33:36.256
And so it's not a relativist perspective.

00:33:37.090 --> 00:33:38.320
It's not to say

00:33:39.395 --> 00:33:42.332
what you think is good, in fact, is bad,

00:33:42.332 --> 00:33:45.900
or all values are possible.

00:33:45.900 --> 00:33:50.900
It is a way to step aside

00:33:51.446 --> 00:33:56.446
and try to do what Michel
Foucault was writing about

00:34:01.245 --> 00:34:06.245
for the bicentenary of
What Is Enlightenment,

00:34:08.478 --> 00:34:11.601
the text by Kant, and saying that

00:34:11.601 --> 00:34:16.601
critique is really in that capacity

00:34:16.964 --> 00:34:21.420
to question what we take for granted,

00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:24.353
what we think as self-evident.

00:34:25.570 --> 00:34:29.805
So this is one aspect
in which I think that

00:34:29.805 --> 00:34:34.805
our work as social scientists
can bring something.

00:34:36.539 --> 00:34:41.345
For example, since I'm
now working on punishment,

00:34:41.345 --> 00:34:43.493
the fact that, in other societies

00:34:43.493 --> 00:34:46.849
or in other times in our own society,

00:34:46.849 --> 00:34:51.849
the treatment by society
of violations of the law

00:34:54.558 --> 00:34:59.558
were not in terms of punishing
or inflicting suffering,

00:35:02.801 --> 00:35:05.889
but were very much involved

00:35:05.889 --> 00:35:09.685
in an economy of exchange,
of repaying a debt.

00:35:09.685 --> 00:35:14.685
Which you find some elements
still in our law today,

00:35:14.850 --> 00:35:16.913
and even more in Islamic law.

00:35:18.330 --> 00:35:22.150
So this is the kind of questioning

00:35:23.223 --> 00:35:25.893
that I think anthropology allows us.

00:35:25.893 --> 00:35:29.580
It allows us by the fact that

00:35:29.580 --> 00:35:31.510
we work in different societies

00:35:31.510 --> 00:35:35.413
and we understand that
the world as we know it,

00:35:35.413 --> 00:35:38.896
especially the world that is close to us,

00:35:38.896 --> 00:35:41.137
is only one of the possibilities,

00:35:41.137 --> 00:35:44.864
and probably not the ultimate possibility.

00:35:44.864 --> 00:35:48.091
And so, this is interesting both

00:35:48.091 --> 00:35:49.980
from an intellectual perspective,

00:35:49.980 --> 00:35:51.350
and I would say also from

00:35:51.350 --> 00:35:54.163
a political or citizen perspective.

00:35:54.163 --> 00:35:56.462
The world is what it is,

00:35:56.462 --> 00:35:58.780
but it could have been different,

00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:02.100
and it can still be different,

00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:06.040
depending on the actions of men and women.

00:36:06.040 --> 00:36:10.266
So it gives a connection between

00:36:10.266 --> 00:36:14.550
intellectual activity and
possible political activity.

00:36:14.550 --> 00:36:16.050
- Let's take some examples.

00:36:16.050 --> 00:36:18.939
So in the study of humanitarianism,

00:36:18.939 --> 00:36:23.861
what you, the good appears to be

00:36:23.861 --> 00:36:28.861
people doing worthwhile things for people

00:36:31.410 --> 00:36:34.030
who are suffering because of illness,

00:36:34.030 --> 00:36:37.360
of war, of natural disaster, and so on.

00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:40.754
But as you probe this, what you discover

00:36:40.754 --> 00:36:44.249
is that there is an inequality

00:36:44.249 --> 00:36:49.249
and there is an emphasis on the suffering,

00:36:49.775 --> 00:36:53.769
which obscures the biographies

00:36:53.769 --> 00:36:57.716
and the stories that
the people have to tell.

00:36:57.716 --> 00:37:02.616
And so what makes us feel
very good, say, in the West,

00:37:02.616 --> 00:37:07.616
about what we're doing,
raises all sorts of questions,

00:37:07.619 --> 00:37:11.973
because in the end,
this charity, in quotes,

00:37:11.973 --> 00:37:16.973
is displacing an understanding
of the political issues

00:37:17.510 --> 00:37:21.290
that are at stake both
locally and internationally.

00:37:21.290 --> 00:37:23.130
- So I think that's a very good example

00:37:23.130 --> 00:37:27.470
of how critical thinking can help us

00:37:27.470 --> 00:37:30.100
address an issue such as humanitarianism.

00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:33.130
Of course, there's a general sense

00:37:33.130 --> 00:37:36.145
that humanitarianism is good,

00:37:36.145 --> 00:37:40.000
assisting people or aiding individuals

00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.599
who are in dire situations,

00:37:43.599 --> 00:37:48.599
conflict and disasters,
in famine, in poverty.

00:37:49.866 --> 00:37:54.866
And I'm not questioning that,
whether it's good or bad.

00:37:55.483 --> 00:37:59.780
What I'm trying to,
first of all, understand

00:38:01.975 --> 00:38:06.975
is why is it that, in
the late 20th Century,

00:38:08.127 --> 00:38:11.631
humanitarianism has
become such an important

00:38:11.631 --> 00:38:16.542
part of the way we govern populations?

00:38:16.542 --> 00:38:20.571
And from international relations

00:38:20.571 --> 00:38:25.571
to local worlds of neighborhoods.

00:38:26.492 --> 00:38:28.710
- Charitable contributions, philanthropy.

00:38:28.710 --> 00:38:30.091
- Exactly.

00:38:30.091 --> 00:38:34.537
So this has not been forever.

00:38:34.537 --> 00:38:38.030
So first of all, to try to identify that,

00:38:38.030 --> 00:38:39.330
that it's a new phenomenon.

00:38:39.330 --> 00:38:44.243
And it's a new phenomenon that is deeply

00:38:44.243 --> 00:38:49.050
with a contradiction that
is, I think, impassable.

00:38:49.050 --> 00:38:51.941
And that's what we can call an aporia.

00:38:51.941 --> 00:38:55.946
Which is, on the one
hand, it is a solidarity.

00:38:55.946 --> 00:38:58.094
So you want to help people.

00:38:58.094 --> 00:39:00.706
But on the other hand,
there's a structural

00:39:00.706 --> 00:39:02.790
inequality that is at stake.

00:39:02.790 --> 00:39:06.373
So the one who is helping is asymmetrical

00:39:06.373 --> 00:39:08.973
from the one who is being helped.

00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:12.870
And when I say that, it's not that I want

00:39:12.870 --> 00:39:15.765
to criticize one aspect or the other.

00:39:15.765 --> 00:39:18.551
It's that it will help us understand,

00:39:18.551 --> 00:39:20.838
first of all, the resentment

00:39:20.838 --> 00:39:25.505
that people who are
helped sometimes express

00:39:25.505 --> 00:39:29.801
against or toward the
person who helps them,

00:39:29.801 --> 00:39:32.785
but also, on the side of the helper,

00:39:32.785 --> 00:39:37.740
the kind of compassion fatigue
that they very often express.

00:39:37.740 --> 00:39:41.150
So that's a very general element

00:39:41.150 --> 00:39:45.680
about the deep contradiction
in humanitarianism.

00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:47.090
And when I say it's impassable,

00:39:47.090 --> 00:39:50.390
it's because it is the
core of humanitarianism.

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:53.195
It's not because you will be
a better humanitarian worker,

00:39:53.195 --> 00:39:56.771
and of course you can, but
that you will change that.

00:39:56.771 --> 00:39:59.232
That's a very deep element.

00:39:59.232 --> 00:40:04.232
But then, as you said, you have a series

00:40:05.699 --> 00:40:09.948
of consequences that you see on the ground

00:40:09.948 --> 00:40:14.948
in the field of this
humanitarian intervention.

00:40:16.984 --> 00:40:21.984
One is that you, because you want to

00:40:23.114 --> 00:40:28.114
speak for the victims of these situations

00:40:32.704 --> 00:40:36.825
where you intervene, you are inclined

00:40:36.825 --> 00:40:41.825
to speak in their stead, and to

00:40:42.398 --> 00:40:46.856
make their voice much less heard.

00:40:46.856 --> 00:40:51.170
Sometimes these voices are too
difficult to be heard anyway.

00:40:51.170 --> 00:40:55.980
But for example, you have people,

00:40:55.980 --> 00:40:58.190
young people in Palestine
who see themselves

00:40:58.190 --> 00:41:03.190
as struggling for their country,

00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:09.640
and you transform them into
victims of trauma, for example.

00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:11.867
And they are, of course.

00:41:11.867 --> 00:41:15.467
But then you obliterate the other aspect.

00:41:15.467 --> 00:41:17.524
- It's a political problem.

00:41:17.524 --> 00:41:21.710
- Exactly, so you transform
a political message

00:41:21.710 --> 00:41:23.363
that they have into a moral

00:41:23.363 --> 00:41:27.520
or sometimes even medical
or psychological issue.

00:41:27.520 --> 00:41:29.354
But there's also, at the marginal level,

00:41:29.354 --> 00:41:34.354
and we see that toward the
end of the 20th Century

00:41:35.160 --> 00:41:37.144
and beginning of the new one,

00:41:37.144 --> 00:41:41.452
the language of humanitarianism

00:41:41.452 --> 00:41:46.452
has tended to replace
and make less hearable

00:41:46.537 --> 00:41:49.230
the language of social justice.

00:41:49.230 --> 00:41:51.470
And it's not because
the humanitarian workers

00:41:51.470 --> 00:41:52.770
are against social justice.

00:41:52.770 --> 00:41:55.001
It's just that it occupies a space

00:41:55.001 --> 00:41:59.668
that was previously more legitimately

00:41:59.668 --> 00:42:02.420
occupied by social justice.

00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:07.420
For example, to continue on Palestine,

00:42:09.130 --> 00:42:11.440
because I've been doing some work

00:42:11.440 --> 00:42:15.388
on the humanitarian actions in Palestine,

00:42:15.388 --> 00:42:20.299
you see that when you transform

00:42:20.299 --> 00:42:25.299
resistance into resilience,
violence into trauma,

00:42:28.043 --> 00:42:32.524
you're changing the perception

00:42:32.524 --> 00:42:37.524
that we have of these,
this political context.

00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.270
So this is the kind of thing that

00:42:41.270 --> 00:42:42.740
I try to do on humanitarianism.

00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:44.730
It's not a frontal critique,

00:42:44.730 --> 00:42:47.270
and myself, I have been involved in that,

00:42:47.270 --> 00:42:50.845
and I have no regrets in having been so,

00:42:50.845 --> 00:42:54.304
but it's really trying to precisely,

00:42:54.304 --> 00:42:58.797
as an insider but also now an outsider,

00:42:58.797 --> 00:43:01.549
try to understand, what are the stakes

00:43:01.549 --> 00:43:05.729
and what are the consequences of this

00:43:05.729 --> 00:43:08.840
humanitarian government, as we have it.

00:43:08.840 --> 00:43:12.450
- One of the important
points that need to be made

00:43:12.450 --> 00:43:15.051
is that, although you
take a particular case

00:43:15.051 --> 00:43:20.051
and immerse yourself in
that particular case,

00:43:20.601 --> 00:43:24.386
that the end result of this is kind of

00:43:24.386 --> 00:43:29.386
a general statement
analysis, a critical theory

00:43:30.237 --> 00:43:35.237
rendering understanding
that applies elsewhere.

00:43:35.822 --> 00:43:39.293
And so, I was struck in reading your book

00:43:39.293 --> 00:43:43.310
on the police in this French suburb

00:43:43.310 --> 00:43:46.456
filled with immigrants and refugees,

00:43:46.456 --> 00:43:51.456
that it was very applicable
for understanding

00:43:51.971 --> 00:43:54.769
what has been going on
in the United States

00:43:54.769 --> 00:43:58.860
and led to the Black Lives
Matter movement here,

00:43:58.860 --> 00:44:03.260
where police, and you use the term,

00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:07.030
quoting Benjamin, "rule
by exception" basically.

00:44:07.030 --> 00:44:10.454
And so, it really helps an American

00:44:10.454 --> 00:44:15.454
understand what's going
on in our own ghettos,

00:44:15.864 --> 00:44:19.640
even though that was not
the focus of your work.

00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:21.990
- I think what you're
saying is very important.

00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.180
Ethnography, because of the very deep

00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:31.538
involvement in time and
energy that it requires,

00:44:31.538 --> 00:44:36.538
cannot be multiplied in
different sites, countries.

00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:43.470
It can be, under a certain limit,

00:44:43.470 --> 00:44:44.810
for example, when you work with a team,

00:44:44.810 --> 00:44:48.830
which is what I've been
doing a few years ago.

00:44:48.830 --> 00:44:52.715
We were 10 researchers and were exploring,

00:44:52.715 --> 00:44:57.160
by ethnography, the state,
as we said, the French state.

00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:01.620
So some were working
in the justice system,

00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.800
other in prison, other with the police,

00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.811
other with the social workers, et cetera.

00:45:05.811 --> 00:45:09.700
But, as an individual, you spend,

00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:12.997
in the case of the prison,

00:45:12.997 --> 00:45:15.586
four years in the same facility,

00:45:15.586 --> 00:45:20.068
in the same short stay prison.

00:45:20.068 --> 00:45:25.068
And of course, an answer that you can,

00:45:26.082 --> 00:45:29.913
or a reaction that you can get is,

00:45:29.913 --> 00:45:33.970
what you described here
is valid for this place,

00:45:33.970 --> 00:45:37.320
but of course, is not
valid for everywhere.

00:45:37.320 --> 00:45:41.952
And of course, that is true.

00:45:41.952 --> 00:45:46.100
I could not assert that
what I've described

00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.396
with the police in one place

00:45:48.396 --> 00:45:51.496
or the prison in another place

00:45:51.496 --> 00:45:56.496
would be generalizable to all
prisons and all the police.

00:45:59.170 --> 00:46:02.154
But I think the question of generalization

00:46:02.154 --> 00:46:05.393
has to be thought in two different ways,

00:46:05.393 --> 00:46:08.270
which can be represented in the following.

00:46:08.270 --> 00:46:12.260
So, you have a horizontal generalization,

00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:14.780
meaning that, for example, those who do

00:46:14.780 --> 00:46:17.885
epidemiological studies
or statistical studies,

00:46:17.885 --> 00:46:20.960
they take a sample and,

00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:23.220
because this sample is randomly chosen,

00:46:23.220 --> 00:46:26.350
they can generalize to
the whole population.

00:46:26.350 --> 00:46:28.311
That's how the polls are working

00:46:28.311 --> 00:46:31.933
for political opinions, for example.

00:46:31.933 --> 00:46:36.933
So this is a horizontal generalization.

00:46:37.762 --> 00:46:40.246
What you've seen in different places,

00:46:40.246 --> 00:46:43.243
you can say that's true
for the whole group.

00:46:44.460 --> 00:46:47.880
There's a different type of generalization

00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.520
that ethnography, and
other methods, can allow,

00:46:51.520 --> 00:46:55.280
what I would call vertical generalization,

00:46:55.280 --> 00:47:00.280
meaning that you can
identify a process, a logic.

00:47:01.690 --> 00:47:05.490
Why, for example, the police
react in a certain way

00:47:05.490 --> 00:47:10.061
to a certain type of situation.

00:47:10.061 --> 00:47:12.185
And this can be generalized,

00:47:12.185 --> 00:47:14.693
not in the sense that you could say

00:47:14.693 --> 00:47:17.096
all the police anywhere in the world

00:47:17.096 --> 00:47:21.601
can act in the same way,

00:47:21.601 --> 00:47:26.220
but these ways of acting,
you will find everywhere.

00:47:26.220 --> 00:47:29.530
And of course, it's not even generalizable

00:47:29.530 --> 00:47:31.715
to the place where you've been working,

00:47:31.715 --> 00:47:34.989
but the processes, the
logic, the mechanisms

00:47:34.989 --> 00:47:37.860
are to be found everywhere.

00:47:37.860 --> 00:47:42.768
And I think that's a very
powerful argument for ethnography,

00:47:42.768 --> 00:47:47.360
and this has also political implications,

00:47:47.360 --> 00:47:50.660
because when you do a work
on the police in France

00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:52.520
and your colleagues tell you,

00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:54.530
well it's valid in this place

00:47:54.530 --> 00:47:57.106
but it has no validity elsewhere,

00:47:57.106 --> 00:48:02.106
it means that you cannot
take any general conclusions.

00:48:02.343 --> 00:48:06.550
But when you go to Brazil
or to the United States

00:48:06.550 --> 00:48:08.610
or to South Africa,
and you meet colleagues

00:48:08.610 --> 00:48:11.470
who are criminologists
and who've read your work

00:48:11.470 --> 00:48:14.185
and say, this is exactly what we see,

00:48:14.185 --> 00:48:18.250
they don't mean that the police

00:48:18.250 --> 00:48:20.037
in South Africa, Brazil,
or the United States

00:48:20.037 --> 00:48:22.753
are the same as the police in France,

00:48:22.753 --> 00:48:27.753
but the mechanism, the processes,
they find, are the same.

00:48:28.560 --> 00:48:30.799
- So that in a way, I mean
when I read your book,

00:48:30.799 --> 00:48:34.070
and I thought about the American ghettos,

00:48:34.070 --> 00:48:36.870
what you see is a similarity in the fact

00:48:36.870 --> 00:48:41.870
that these are underprivileged,
poverty-ridden communities,

00:48:43.376 --> 00:48:47.420
and I see an emphasis on law and order

00:48:47.420 --> 00:48:49.700
that's coming from the top, and that,

00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:52.280
in the case of Europe, is mingled with

00:48:52.280 --> 00:48:55.714
concerns about terrorism, creating quotas

00:48:55.714 --> 00:49:00.714
to arrest and harass
people in these areas,

00:49:01.050 --> 00:49:04.862
whether it's through checking
their pockets for marijuana

00:49:04.862 --> 00:49:07.173
or enforcing traffic tickets,

00:49:07.173 --> 00:49:12.151
that then create a loop
in which these people,

00:49:12.151 --> 00:49:15.275
something else is going
on besides law enforcement

00:49:15.275 --> 00:49:17.050
in the case of the police.

00:49:17.050 --> 00:49:20.824
There's a bigger picture here

00:49:20.824 --> 00:49:24.957
that is rooted in inequality,

00:49:24.957 --> 00:49:28.740
and actually, politics actually,

00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:32.260
because the people over
the police, for example,

00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:35.070
are creating quotas to measure,

00:49:35.070 --> 00:49:40.070
and the politicians wanna
respond to the fear of people.

00:49:40.723 --> 00:49:42.120
- Yeah.

00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:47.120
It's very important to link what you see

00:49:47.316 --> 00:49:52.316
on the ground, the way
the police are acting,

00:49:52.878 --> 00:49:57.765
with the institution that they belong to,

00:49:57.765 --> 00:50:01.503
the profession in which they participate,

00:50:05.231 --> 00:50:07.529
and the general policies.

00:50:07.529 --> 00:50:12.529
And when you have law and order policies,

00:50:15.590 --> 00:50:20.590
from the police academy to
the supervision of the work,

00:50:22.483 --> 00:50:26.094
when you have the idea
that certain neighborhoods

00:50:26.094 --> 00:50:31.094
are to be police property, in a sense,

00:50:31.608 --> 00:50:36.608
where the welfare state
is not very consistent,

00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:41.442
and you turn to the repressive side,

00:50:41.442 --> 00:50:44.716
so this is something that has to be

00:50:44.716 --> 00:50:49.716
taken into account, to
understand that, in the end,

00:50:53.367 --> 00:50:58.367
and that's what I try to
show in Enforcing Order,

00:51:00.290 --> 00:51:05.150
is that, instead of
enforcing a public order,

00:51:05.150 --> 00:51:10.150
what happens is that the police
are enforcing social order.

00:51:12.464 --> 00:51:17.464
So they remind the people of
low income minority background,

00:51:20.753 --> 00:51:23.880
and living in housing
projects in particular,

00:51:23.880 --> 00:51:26.280
they remind them their place in society.

00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:28.799
So it's not that they
would arrest criminals,

00:51:28.799 --> 00:51:33.799
or that they would stop drug dealers.

00:51:33.815 --> 00:51:38.815
They harass young men,
or sometimes immigrants,

00:51:39.040 --> 00:51:42.383
but most of the time young
men of immigrant background,

00:51:42.383 --> 00:51:47.383
and they know them, and they
pass them their documents

00:51:48.525 --> 00:51:52.430
and then they search them,
and they do that everyday.

00:51:52.430 --> 00:51:54.434
So you cannot think of this as

00:51:54.434 --> 00:51:59.252
public security or public order.

00:51:59.252 --> 00:52:04.252
And in fact, their superiors
know that very well.

00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:07.260
They've told me that these units

00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.197
were often creating more
problems than they were solving.

00:52:12.197 --> 00:52:15.332
But then you have to ask yourself,

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:19.581
so why are they working
these neighborhoods

00:52:19.581 --> 00:52:22.356
if it's not, mainly, I'm
not saying that they're not

00:52:22.356 --> 00:52:25.479
arresting criminals in
some cases, of course,

00:52:25.479 --> 00:52:27.801
but their main role is to maintain,

00:52:27.801 --> 00:52:30.850
not a public order, but a social order.

00:52:30.850 --> 00:52:33.188
And that's what you find, obviously,

00:52:33.188 --> 00:52:37.019
in the kind of relationship that you see

00:52:37.019 --> 00:52:42.019
in the American inner cities, for example.

00:52:43.080 --> 00:52:46.830
- In your new book, which is in press,

00:52:46.830 --> 00:52:51.177
I saw this line in reading
the parts that I've read.

00:52:51.177 --> 00:52:54.109
"Ethnography derives from a project

00:52:54.109 --> 00:52:58.900
"whereby the anthropologist
strives both to understand,"

00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:02.317
and we've talked a lot about
how you come to understand,

00:53:02.317 --> 00:53:05.540
"and to lead others to understand."

00:53:05.540 --> 00:53:07.821
So I guess I wanna ask
about the second part.

00:53:07.821 --> 00:53:12.821
That is, how do these
insights have an impact,

00:53:15.918 --> 00:53:17.840
how do you think they have an impact?

00:53:17.840 --> 00:53:19.710
And how do you hope they will

00:53:19.710 --> 00:53:23.890
impact society in actual policy?

00:53:23.890 --> 00:53:28.585
- In recent years, I've tried to reflect

00:53:28.585 --> 00:53:32.776
more than I used to and more than we do,

00:53:32.776 --> 00:53:35.450
in anthropology and sociology,

00:53:35.450 --> 00:53:40.450
on what I've called the public
afterlife of ethnography,

00:53:41.286 --> 00:53:45.190
or the public afterlife of
our work more generally.

00:53:45.190 --> 00:53:50.190
So we as social scientists
usually think that

00:53:50.794 --> 00:53:55.288
there's an empirical and
theoretical moment in our work,

00:53:55.288 --> 00:54:00.288
and then we translate this ethnography

00:54:00.640 --> 00:54:05.640
or statistics and theorization
of it into articles, books,

00:54:06.469 --> 00:54:11.469
and then we move on to the next project.

00:54:12.133 --> 00:54:15.338
And I think we can, first of all,

00:54:15.338 --> 00:54:20.338
be more attentive to the
kinds of interactions

00:54:21.201 --> 00:54:24.123
we have with our public,

00:54:28.438 --> 00:54:33.438
and also try to extend
the publics that we have.

00:54:35.945 --> 00:54:38.627
So we know that, for
example, the economists,

00:54:38.627 --> 00:54:43.627
at least some of them, publish
their very specific articles

00:54:45.814 --> 00:54:48.460
in the best journals of their discipline,

00:54:48.460 --> 00:54:50.850
but they can also write books

00:54:50.850 --> 00:54:53.163
that have a more general audience.

00:54:55.230 --> 00:54:57.480
And we, even the
anthropologists have done that.

00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.800
You have Claude Lévi-Strauss

00:54:59.800 --> 00:55:02.370
writing structural anthropology,

00:55:02.370 --> 00:55:07.370
or before that, writing on kinship,

00:55:09.488 --> 00:55:14.473
but at the same time,
writing Tristes Tropiques.

00:55:16.158 --> 00:55:19.181
So the question is, how can you reach

00:55:19.181 --> 00:55:23.906
a public that is not just your colleagues,

00:55:23.906 --> 00:55:26.472
but a broader audience,

00:55:26.472 --> 00:55:29.839
if the topics on which you work

00:55:29.839 --> 00:55:32.440
are of general interest?

00:55:32.440 --> 00:55:35.307
And this goes somewhat against

00:55:35.307 --> 00:55:37.420
some of the academic rules.

00:55:37.420 --> 00:55:40.863
Or at least academic habits.

00:55:43.022 --> 00:55:47.347
But I think it's important
for the social sciences,

00:55:47.347 --> 00:55:50.052
and perhaps anthropology in particular,

00:55:50.052 --> 00:55:54.301
to reach out for broader audiences,

00:55:54.301 --> 00:55:59.301
to have a place in the public sphere,

00:56:00.187 --> 00:56:05.187
because we produce empirical
and theoretical elements

00:56:05.980 --> 00:56:10.590
that can be appropriated
either by the policy makers

00:56:10.590 --> 00:56:13.980
or by the activists or by
the population themselves.

00:56:13.980 --> 00:56:17.010
So this public afterlife, I think,

00:56:17.010 --> 00:56:22.010
should be taken into account
much more than it is the case.

00:56:24.890 --> 00:56:27.053
- I regret to say our time is up,

00:56:27.053 --> 00:56:28.760
but I wanna thank for very much

00:56:28.760 --> 00:56:32.410
for these powerful insights into the work

00:56:32.410 --> 00:56:37.351
of ethnography and critical theory.

00:56:37.351 --> 00:56:42.250
And I do wanna propose to our audience

00:56:42.250 --> 00:56:46.880
that they take a look at some
of the books we've discussed.

00:56:46.880 --> 00:56:50.790
Humanitarian Reason, Enforcing Order,

00:56:50.790 --> 00:56:53.305
an Ethnography of Urban Policing,

00:56:53.305 --> 00:56:57.171
At the Heart of the State, the
Moral World of Institutions,

00:56:57.171 --> 00:57:02.171
and finally, your new book,
in press, Prison Worlds.

00:57:02.350 --> 00:57:04.930
So thank you very much,
Didier, for being with us.

00:57:04.930 --> 00:57:05.763
- Thank you Harry.

00:57:05.763 --> 00:57:07.444
- And thank you very much for joining us

00:57:07.444 --> 00:57:10.623
for this conversation with history.
