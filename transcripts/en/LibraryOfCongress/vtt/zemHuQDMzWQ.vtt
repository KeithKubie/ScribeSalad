&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:17.530
&gt;&gt; Travis Painter: Hello!

00:00:17.530 --> 00:00:19.660
I'll tell you, it's
not often that we get

00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:23.340
to have Lady Gaga
blaring in this room.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:27.510
So good evening,
and happy pride.

[ Cheering ]

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:34.110
As I was walking around before
we started, I had talked

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.840
to a couple of people, and found
out that somebody even came here

00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:38.140
for their birthday today.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.030
So happy birthday to Ellie
up front in the front row.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:43.050
[ Cheering ]

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:47.560
On behalf of the Library, and
of Congress, Dr. Carla Hayden,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:50.410
we want to welcome you guys to
the Library of Congress tonight.

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:53.100
My name is Travis Painter,
and I'm the Chairman

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.340
of the Library's LGBTQ+,
an employee organization,

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:59.360
what's called LC Globe.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:02.240
And LC Globe was organized 24
years ago, and we are proud

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.160
to represent the
Library's LGBTQ+ employees.

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.670
We have a lot of different
programs that we've put on,

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:12.570
different cultural programs,
different educational programs,

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.970
to highlight the
collections that we have

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:20.460
that represent the LGBTQ
contribution to American society

00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:23.200
and what we do every day here
at the Library of Congress.

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.940
We're eager tonight
to co-host an event

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:28.590
with an award-winning author.

00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.050
She is the writer
of several novels,

00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:33.430
including the best seller, Simon
vs. The Homo Sapiens Agenda.

00:01:33.430 --> 00:01:35.650
And that was adapted to a film

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:38.550
that became a box
office hit, Love, Simon.

00:01:38.550 --> 00:01:41.620
So we're honored to have
Becky Albertalli here tonight.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:44.070
We're eager to hear
her talk about Simon

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:46.800
and the entire universe
that she has created

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.700
around these unforgettable
characters.

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:53.130
So tonight, we will learn more
about her literary inspirations,

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.300
her new books that are
coming out, and much more.

00:01:55.300 --> 00:01:57.050
We want to thank
some of our partners

00:01:57.050 --> 00:01:59.310
for making tonight
such a success.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:04.290
We have the Congressional CSA,
Congressional Staff Association;

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:09.320
GLASS, which is the Senate LGBTQ
employee organization, as well.

00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:11.860
And, of course, the
organizers of Capital Pride.

00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.160
We want to encourage
you to visit.

00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:14.650
We have a display that
was set up in the front.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:16.710
A lot of you probably
saw that when we came in.

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:20.410
At the library, we have
such a vast collection.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:25.410
We have iconic poetry
from Whit Waltman.

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:27.230
Excuse me.

00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:28.530
Walt Whitman.

00:02:28.530 --> 00:02:31.210
To the manuscripts
of the founder

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.250
of the LGBTQ activism
here, Frank Kameny.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:38.970
And we have the papers of
Jonathan Larson, who wrote Rent.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:41.920
And you can see the
math that he did to come

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:46.010
up with 525,600 minutes.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:47.310
So you're welcome.

00:02:47.310 --> 00:02:49.520
That will be in your head
the rest of the night.

00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:51.490
Yeah, so we have all of these
amazing collections here.

00:02:51.490 --> 00:02:54.640
And you can see some of them out
in the foyer on your way out.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:57.450
But now to talk about tonight's
event and why we're here,

00:02:57.450 --> 00:03:03.140
after the presentation
outside, you can buy the book

00:03:03.140 --> 00:03:06.280
and have Becky sign it for you.

00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.340
And, again, she's an
award-winning writer.

00:03:09.340 --> 00:03:11.240
She's the author of
three best-selling books;

00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:13.090
Simon vs. The Homo
Sapiens Agenda,

00:03:13.090 --> 00:03:16.820
The Upside of Unrequited,
and Leah on the Offbeat.

00:03:16.820 --> 00:03:19.240
She has a new book scheduled
to come out this October,

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:22.640
and I know a lot of you
are excited to read that.

00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:25.350
Becky has a gift of
believably writing

00:03:25.350 --> 00:03:27.700
in the voice of a teenager.

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:31.200
One reviewer said, "are
you absolutely certain

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:33.800
that Becky Albertalli
didn't steal the diary

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:37.260
of a hilariously
observant teenage boy?"

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:39.890
So tonight, Becky will be
interviewed by the Library

00:03:39.890 --> 00:03:42.230
of Congress's Chief
Communications Officer,

00:03:42.230 --> 00:03:45.340

like many of you,

00:03:45.340 --> 00:03:47.960
have fallen for Simon
and his friends.

00:03:47.960 --> 00:03:51.510
So now, please help me welcome
to the stage Becky Albertalli.

everyone, and thank you, Travis,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:19.550
for that wonderful introduction.

00:04:19.550 --> 00:04:21.540
And welcome, Becky.

00:04:21.540 --> 00:04:22.990

you so much for having me.

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:24.930
This is an amazing
crowd, oh my gosh.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:26.440
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: It's like
a little homecoming for you.

00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.800
I understand you used to
live here in Washington.

00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:30.580
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Yeah, this is-- yeah.

00:04:30.580 --> 00:04:38.630
And I think a lot of my
friends are out here.

00:04:38.630 --> 00:04:40.220
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You don't
mind if we share the story

00:04:40.220 --> 00:04:42.460
of who you bumped into when
you arrived in Washington.

00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:43.760
It's such a small world.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.060
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Oh, yeah, no.

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.680
Yeah, you know, so I really
got here not too long before

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.980
the event.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.000
It's been kind of
a whirlwind trip.

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.250
I checked into my hotel,
walked outside, and five--

00:04:58.250 --> 00:05:03.160
less than five minutes later,
I bumped into my prom date

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:09.470
from high school, who
had just moved back here

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:12.530
from Atlanta, which
is so awesome.

00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:14.760
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Well, let's talk Simon.

00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.000
So I have to be honest, you
know, after I read the book,

00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.480
after I saw the movie, there
was a part of me that kind

00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.820
of fantasized that I
was a teenage boy again

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:26.910
and had a teenage
boyfriend via e-mail.

00:05:26.910 --> 00:05:30.930
So I'm guessing you
hear this a lot.

00:05:30.930 --> 00:05:33.810
So you hear this a lot from
probably grown men like me, or,

00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.410
you know, teenagers that this
book relate to them a lot.

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.440
What did you tap into,
and how did you get

00:05:39.440 --> 00:05:42.410
into the psych of
a 16-year-old boy?

00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:43.710
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Thank you.

00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:45.420
I'm really glad it
worked for you.

00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:47.640
And, you know, I'm always
glad when the book works

00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:50.570
for somebody, because
it's never a guarantee.

00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.070
I think when I wrote this
book, and with all of my books,

00:05:58.070 --> 00:06:01.390
I really tried to
I guess like tap

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:05.010
into that individual
character's head.

00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.400
And it's kind of a deep dive.

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:13.520
So, you know, when I wrote
Simon, I mean like, I was,

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.440
I was like living in Simon.

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.020
And I didn't tell anybody.

00:06:19.020 --> 00:06:24.680
I think I told maybe like
one or two people after I was

00:06:24.680 --> 00:06:26.080
like almost done drafting it.

00:06:26.080 --> 00:06:28.000
I was very, very
private about it.

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.170
But like I carried this
kid with me everywhere.

00:06:31.170 --> 00:06:39.420
And I think, you know, my
books, all of the, you know,

00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:40.910
have a lot of me in them.

00:06:40.910 --> 00:06:45.030
Simon-- I get the question
a lot, like what was it

00:06:45.030 --> 00:06:49.390
like writing about a character
who is so different from you?

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:52.560
I'm like, I haven't done
it yet, so I don't know.

00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:55.910
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
I mean, but you--

00:06:55.910 --> 00:06:57.480
it's hard enough
being a teenager.

00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:00.550
A normal straight
teenager has a lot of acts.

00:07:00.550 --> 00:07:03.690
A gay teenager has
a whole lot more.

00:07:03.690 --> 00:07:05.350
And you describe it very well.

00:07:05.350 --> 00:07:06.650
As Travis said in
the introduction,

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.270
it's like you're writing
from a teenage boy's diary.

00:07:10.270 --> 00:07:11.570
What was your basis?

00:07:11.570 --> 00:07:12.930
Who inspired you?

00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.230
Where did Simon come from?

00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:16.130
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
I actually read a lot

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:20.180
of teenage boys-- no, I did not.

00:07:20.180 --> 00:07:21.480
No, I did not.

00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:22.780
I feel like when
you're a psychologist,

00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:24.080
you cannot say that.

00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:27.820
That's actually the first thing
I always want to say is a lot

00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.960
of people know I used
to be a psychologist.

00:07:30.960 --> 00:07:33.800
And so it's really, really
important I feel like to lead

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:38.510
with the fact that Simon is
not based on anybody I work

00:07:38.510 --> 00:07:43.190
with because, you know, my
priority, no matter what,

00:07:43.190 --> 00:07:45.620
even as an author, even though
I haven't practiced psychology

00:07:45.620 --> 00:07:48.510
in years, like my priority
is making sure the clients

00:07:48.510 --> 00:07:50.640
that I work with
don't feel vulnerable.

00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:53.650
So I don't touch that.

00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:56.360
You know, I think
sometimes people I know

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.360
from real life make
their way into the books.

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.630
Sometimes I don't realize
it until afterwards.

00:08:02.630 --> 00:08:06.730
And sometimes like I
find myself like popping

00:08:06.730 --> 00:08:09.210
up in the book in
unexpected places.

00:08:09.210 --> 00:08:11.150
Like I remember there
was this moment.

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:12.450
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Do
you like Oreos then?

00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:15.140
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Well, yeah, yeah.

00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:16.660
People are like,
well, people are like,

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:18.310
what is the symbolic
meaning of Oreos?

00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.320
And I'm like, all right,
well, let me tell you.

00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.000
Like, I really like Oreos.

00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:24.300
That's it.

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:35.760
But I think there was one
moment where, you know,

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.850
I think I was describing
just like a little

00:08:38.850 --> 00:08:44.560
like technique I used to use in
therapy sessions, which was kind

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:48.360
of like a bribe where I would
let-- I worked in a school,

00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:51.970
so I would let kids like
use their social media

00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:55.100
in therapy sessions, which
they desperately wanted to do,

00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:58.510
because it was school and they
wanted to be on the internet,

00:08:58.510 --> 00:09:01.530
if they would let me sit right
next to them, and we would talk

00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.940
about everything
in their sessions.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:05.740
And I was describing this

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:07.660
to like a room full
of high schoolers.

00:09:07.660 --> 00:09:09.370
And I think I like
realized in that moment,

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:11.790
I'm like, I'm Simon's mom.

00:09:11.790 --> 00:09:16.650
Like this whole time, I
thought I was the teenager,

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:21.460
like I thought I was cool,
and I'm not, like I'm the mom.

00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:23.600
But she's like kind
of a cool mom.

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:27.570
And Jennifer Garner has like
completely made her cool.

00:09:27.570 --> 00:09:33.140
So like I am like really,
really okay with it now.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:34.490
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: She
was Sydney Bristow.

00:09:34.490 --> 00:09:37.870
We'll talk more about
Jennifer Garner in our next.

00:09:37.870 --> 00:09:39.240
Anyway, I swear, if
this book was around,

00:09:39.240 --> 00:09:42.690
it would have helped me
a lot when I was 15, 16.

00:09:42.690 --> 00:09:45.670
Back in the 80s when I was that
age, there was really nothing.

00:09:45.670 --> 00:09:47.770
And I asked Andre
Aciman this yesterday.

00:09:47.770 --> 00:09:51.670
Most of the characters or
any from books to movies,

00:09:51.670 --> 00:09:54.570
every time it's a gay character,
you're either a sidekick,

00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:58.170
either comic relief, or there's
some tremendous tragedy attached

00:09:58.170 --> 00:09:59.470
to it.

00:09:59.470 --> 00:10:01.750
But the beauty of
Simon is, there's none.

00:10:01.750 --> 00:10:06.160
He, and like from Call Me by
Your Name, everybody's main kind

00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:07.770
of big issue is just love.

00:10:07.770 --> 00:10:10.770
And I think everybody can
relate to that, right?

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:12.200
&gt;&gt; Beck Albertalli: Yeah, you
know, and I think, I mean,

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:16.050
I feel strongly there's a
place for all kinds of stories,

00:10:16.050 --> 00:10:21.460
and especially, you
know, a lot of times,

00:10:21.460 --> 00:10:24.330
you'll find there are some
really painful stories sometimes

00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:25.720
coming from within
the community,

00:10:25.720 --> 00:10:29.750
and people telling their own
stories, or kind of using,

00:10:29.750 --> 00:10:34.090
drawing upon their own
experiences in different ways.

00:10:34.090 --> 00:10:39.340
But I think that has
been one of the things

00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:41.980
that I think has resonated with
a lot of people about Simon.

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:46.430
It's just like the joy
of the love story in it.

00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:48.010
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: And what I

00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.720
like about him the most is
he doesn't make a big deal

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.020
that he's gay.

00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:55.890
I mean, for him,
it doesn't even--

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:57.530
his sexuality doesn't
bother him.

00:10:57.530 --> 00:10:59.190
So I wanted to read
something from--

00:10:59.190 --> 00:11:01.930
actually, it's just
from page two.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:04.470
It's a giant holy
box of awkwardness,

00:11:04.470 --> 00:11:07.370
and I won't pretend I'm looking
forward to it, but it probably,

00:11:07.370 --> 00:11:10.320
probably wouldn't be the end
of the world, not for me.

00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:11.890
So that just kind
of sets up a scene

00:11:11.890 --> 00:11:13.380
that it's like, oh, whatever.

00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:16.230
Do you think this
is generational,

00:11:16.230 --> 00:11:19.320
or depends where you
live in the country?

00:11:19.320 --> 00:11:22.450
And I don't want to
minimize other kids' issues

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.640
of coming out, because
everyone has their own process

00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:26.010
that they have to go through.

00:11:26.010 --> 00:11:30.610
But I think that's what made
maybe Simon more refreshing.

00:11:30.610 --> 00:11:32.230
Many kids could relate to it,

00:11:32.230 --> 00:11:37.080
especially the next generation
of, you know, young gay adults.

00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:38.390
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: I think,

00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:40.050
I think that's a
really good question.

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:41.850
I think it's really complicated,

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:45.220
and certainly somewhat
generational.

00:11:45.220 --> 00:11:51.730
But it's not like, you know,
change isn't always linear.

00:11:51.730 --> 00:11:55.190
And, you know, I
really do believe

00:11:55.190 --> 00:11:58.580
that not only does
environment play such a role,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:12:02.360
but it just like, it
can get, you know,

00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:03.990
down to the specific family.

00:12:03.990 --> 00:12:09.560
Like I really think if Simon
had a next door neighbor,

00:12:09.560 --> 00:12:11.360
it could be a closest
family friend, you know,

00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:15.040
and if there was a gay
kid in that family,

00:12:15.040 --> 00:12:18.890
that kid may have a totally
different experience than Simon

00:12:18.890 --> 00:12:24.480
for any number of reasons, some
of which is just, you know,

00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.630
different people have
different comfort levels

00:12:26.630 --> 00:12:29.170
with like sharing things,
and different types

00:12:29.170 --> 00:12:33.480
of relationship dynamics
with their family.

00:12:33.480 --> 00:12:38.040
So kind of in a very
like, you know, micro way,

00:12:38.040 --> 00:12:42.810
I think those differences
are significant.

00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:46.730
So it's really hard to
generalize and say like,

00:12:46.730 --> 00:12:48.160
you know, because
I've had people,

00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:50.120
and I think the way
people read the book

00:12:50.120 --> 00:12:52.580
or experience the movie
can be very informed

00:12:52.580 --> 00:12:55.200
by their own experiences.

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.980
So there are people
who are like,

00:12:56.980 --> 00:12:59.490
this is exactly what it's like.

00:12:59.490 --> 00:13:04.140
And then there have been people,
I think there was an article,

00:13:04.140 --> 00:13:06.000
and like bless his heart,
this guy who wrote it got

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.050
like dragged on Twitter, and he
was like, everybody was like,

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:12.740
who is this straight
guy like saying this?

00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:14.670
He wasn't a straight
guy who wrote it.

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.310
But he was like, he was the
one who asked the question,

00:13:18.310 --> 00:13:20.580
like do kids really
need this film anymore?

00:13:20.580 --> 00:13:22.290
Was it like Time Magazine?

00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:24.800
Does anybody-- there are
people who remember that slang.

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:30.050
And actually like this article
did have some really interesting

00:13:30.050 --> 00:13:31.510
critiques about like
kind of some

00:13:31.510 --> 00:13:35.340
of the intracommunity dynamics
and like nuances within that.

00:13:35.340 --> 00:13:39.570
But, you know, it was, I
think people really responded

00:13:39.570 --> 00:13:40.870
to that particular question.

00:13:40.870 --> 00:13:42.580
Like do teens really need this?

00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:46.720
Because, I think, there
is this idea somewhat

00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.730
that like we solve
like homophobia.

00:13:49.730 --> 00:13:53.990
But that's so far from the
lived experience of so many

00:13:53.990 --> 00:14:01.270
of my readers, which, you know,
that's just like, you know,

00:14:01.270 --> 00:14:03.610
that's just talking about
like readers in the U.S.,

00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:05.720
like when you think
globally, I mean,

00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.320
they just like canceled the
release of Love, Simon in India.

00:14:09.320 --> 00:14:10.760
Like people are devastated.

00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:14.420
Like this is the
reality across the world.

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.690
It's just a lot of it has to do
with like where you were born

00:14:17.690 --> 00:14:21.000
and who your family is, and
that can shape that experience.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.830
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: And I
feel like young adult writers

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.900
like you really help, from John
Green to yourself, have brought

00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:30.940
up so many issues that teens
could not really relate

00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.240
to beforehand.

00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:33.970
And so they started
reading about it.

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:35.270
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: I hope so.

00:14:35.270 --> 00:14:37.110
It's like, I don't know, that's
wonderful company to be in.

00:14:37.110 --> 00:14:39.550
I love John Green.

00:14:39.550 --> 00:14:41.210
Yeah, you know, it's
interesting,

00:14:41.210 --> 00:14:43.990
because when I wrote this
book, Simon in particular,

00:14:43.990 --> 00:14:46.210
which is my first book, which
I never thought would be

00:14:46.210 --> 00:14:47.510
published, by the way.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.810
It's like still very strange.

00:14:48.810 --> 00:14:51.680
But, you know, I really thought

00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:54.060
of it the whole time
as a love story.

00:14:54.060 --> 00:15:00.870
And, you know, it's kind of
almost like retroactively taken

00:15:00.870 --> 00:15:03.620
on a certain significance,
mostly because of the movie

00:15:03.620 --> 00:15:06.760
and the studio backing and
that being kind of a moment

00:15:06.760 --> 00:15:11.940
in the film industry, you
know, but Simon is not--

00:15:11.940 --> 00:15:14.180
I get really squirmy sometimes.

00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:17.080
People feel like Simon is
the first gay love story,

00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:18.380
gay [inaudible] love story.

00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.640
And I'm like, oh my
gosh, like first of all,

00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:21.970
you're in for a treat.

00:15:21.970 --> 00:15:24.160
Because there is a
whole like, you know,

00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:26.550
there's like a whole
history behind it.

00:15:26.550 --> 00:15:30.860
Like, you know, when I
wrote Simon and I was kind

00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.940
of trying to, you know,
figure out how to position it

00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.090
to like publishing
houses and stuff.

00:15:37.090 --> 00:15:40.530
Like, you know, some of the
authors who are in my mind were

00:15:40.530 --> 00:15:44.540
like David Levithan, Bill
Konigsberg, you know,

00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.810
there's like Brent
Hartinger, Geography Club.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:53.850
I mean, there's so many
wonderful books that, you know,

00:15:53.850 --> 00:15:56.460
I like describe it as like,
you know, it's like standing

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.230
on the shoulders of giants.

00:15:59.230 --> 00:16:03.710
And there's this whole
conversation, and, you know,

00:16:03.710 --> 00:16:06.790
more and more books being
written in the space,

00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.840
and it's exciting
to be a part of it.

00:16:09.840 --> 00:16:11.140
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
People tend to call them

00:16:11.140 --> 00:16:15.090
that crossover appeal books when
they're just good books, right?

00:16:15.090 --> 00:16:16.390
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: I hope so.

00:16:16.390 --> 00:16:18.240
I like the idea of it.

00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:22.910
I know that like I get a
lot of people who are like,

00:16:22.910 --> 00:16:24.610
I'm not your target age range.

00:16:24.610 --> 00:16:27.400
Like I know I shouldn't be
reading YA, I'm like 28.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:34.810
And I'm like, I'm 35, and
like I like only read YA now.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:38.330
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I'm
48, and I'm reading them.

00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:40.480
I should say, though,
and let's talk about some

00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:41.780
of the stuff in the book.

00:16:41.780 --> 00:16:45.260
I really like the part that
you use the e-mail conversation

00:16:45.260 --> 00:16:46.560
to move the story forward.

00:16:46.560 --> 00:16:48.480
So I just kind of want
to read some parts here.

00:16:48.480 --> 00:16:51.630
On page 59, so I'm a complete
nerd here, but we do work

00:16:51.630 --> 00:16:53.950
at the Library, so
we're allowed to, right?

00:16:53.950 --> 00:16:59.190
So here's one of the, I think
it's an e-mail from Simon

00:16:59.190 --> 00:17:02.360
to Blue, from Jacques
to Blue, I should say.

00:17:02.360 --> 00:17:05.110
So I keep thinking about the
idea of secret identities.

00:17:05.110 --> 00:17:07.440
Do you ever feel
locked into yourself?

00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:09.680
I'm not sure if I'm
making sense here.

00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:12.470
I guess what I mean is
that sometimes it seems

00:17:12.470 --> 00:17:15.040
like everyone knows
who I am except me.

00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:17.300
That's fantastic.

00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:18.720
Then I love how you always kind

00:17:18.720 --> 00:17:20.140
of put pop culture
into everything.

00:17:20.140 --> 00:17:23.300
So in one of the
e-mails, it says, P.S.,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.170
I'm attaching a Reese's
cup to this e-mail.

00:17:25.170 --> 00:17:27.270
I hope this is what
you had in mind.

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.330
Is this why kids are
relating to this so much,

00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:34.930
the pop culture references, the
use of e-mail, and, you know,

00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:38.770
how he was outed, thus, leaving
your e-mail not logged off,

00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:40.190
and somebody else
logging into it?

00:17:40.190 --> 00:17:42.880
I mean, these are things
that actually happen.

00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:44.340
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Yeah,
you know, I don't know.

00:17:44.340 --> 00:17:49.670
It's, I think, a very
personal experience, you know,

00:17:49.670 --> 00:17:51.880
with Simon readers and
with readers in general,

00:17:51.880 --> 00:17:55.220
like what's the moment in
the book that connects you

00:17:55.220 --> 00:18:01.090
to that character, you know,
so there are a lot of people

00:18:01.090 --> 00:18:02.980
who can relate to, you know,

00:18:02.980 --> 00:18:05.780
Simon's thoughts
about coming out.

00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:07.310
Believe it or not, I get like,

00:18:07.310 --> 00:18:10.110
you would not believe how many
e-mails I get that are like,

00:18:10.110 --> 00:18:13.500
I love this book, it has so
many Harry Potter references.

00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.710
And I'm like, I get
it, yeah, like no,

00:18:15.710 --> 00:18:19.050
I have loved books
because of that too.

00:18:19.050 --> 00:18:21.260
Like Harry Potter,
especially, it's like so full

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:23.560
of Harry Potter references.

00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:32.470
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: What are your
current pop culture obsessions?

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.110
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Okay, so,
well, in addition to like Love,

00:18:35.110 --> 00:18:37.480
Simon, which is just like
embarrassing how much I love it,

00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.360
and I can say that because it's
like I didn't make the movie.

00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:47.710
I just, I've seen it 13
times, like on purpose.

00:18:47.710 --> 00:18:53.870
Hamilton, Jeremy Hanson,
and, oh, gosh, I feel like,

00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:58.970
I feel like I'm missing
something big.

00:18:58.970 --> 00:19:00.270
Like what am I into?

00:19:00.270 --> 00:19:03.190
It's not Paw Patrol
and it's not--

00:19:03.190 --> 00:19:08.860
I'm like, it's not the things
that I actually watch the most

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.000
in my day-to-day life, which are
definitely like Power Rangers

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.950
and Paw Patrol and like
God knows what YouTube toy

00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:18.310
unboxing videos.

00:19:18.310 --> 00:19:20.390
Like I have two young kids.

00:19:20.390 --> 00:19:22.730
But to the extent
that I have time for,

00:19:22.730 --> 00:19:24.380
and I think I love the things

00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:28.710
that like nerdy theater
teenagers like.

00:19:28.710 --> 00:19:30.010
Am I right?

00:19:30.010 --> 00:19:31.500
Are there any like
theater kids out here?

00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.690
[ Cheering ]

00:19:33.690 --> 00:19:38.070
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I like how
you use diversity in your books.

00:19:38.070 --> 00:19:39.550
And I'm not just
talking about race.

00:19:39.550 --> 00:19:43.310
But between, you know, gay
and bisexuals, and just kids

00:19:43.310 --> 00:19:46.160
of all shapes and
sizes are all in there,

00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:51.250
was that a conscious
decision of yours?

00:19:51.250 --> 00:19:52.550
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Yes and no.

00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:57.000
I mean, I think to
some extent, you know,

00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:03.480
there's just the desire to, you
know, create a world that is

00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:05.750
as inclusive as the
world that I live in.

00:20:05.750 --> 00:20:10.630
And, you know, I think I
get more credit for that,

00:20:10.630 --> 00:20:13.200
for Simon, than I deserve.

00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:16.940
The movie actually improved
upon what I did in the book.

00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:19.210
And so that's something that
I'm really excited about,

00:20:19.210 --> 00:20:22.180
just some of the casting
choices in the movie.

00:20:23.580 --> 00:20:29.120
But, yeah, I think
certainly increasingly,

00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.840
as I've written more and more
books, it's something I think

00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.110
about with like every word that
I write, because, you know,

00:20:37.110 --> 00:20:41.010
for better, for worse,
every book that I've written

00:20:41.010 --> 00:20:42.880
after Simon I've written

00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:46.690
with a very acute
awareness of my audience.

00:20:46.690 --> 00:20:48.530
It makes it, you
know, you can get

00:20:48.530 --> 00:20:50.110
like paralyzed by that kind of.

00:20:50.110 --> 00:20:52.380
Like, you know, you're
like trying to write a book

00:20:52.380 --> 00:20:55.080
with like all these sequels
reading over your shoulder.

00:20:55.080 --> 00:20:57.340
But I think it's
really important.

00:20:57.340 --> 00:21:02.450
And, you know, I
have been very aware

00:21:02.450 --> 00:21:08.250
of who my Simon readers are
and who I'm hearing from.

00:21:08.250 --> 00:21:14.010
And so, you know, I can't
imagine ever writing a book,

00:21:14.010 --> 00:21:16.580
for example, that
doesn't have, you know,

00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:18.760
I'm not saying the main
character is always going

00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.240
to be part of the LGBTQQIAAP
community, but there's going

00:21:23.240 --> 00:21:25.840
to be characters from the
community within my books,

00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:28.370
because I'm not-- I can't
see myself writing a book

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:33.800
where all these readers who
trust me and have read my books

00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.710
like feel like they don't have
a home, you know, and, you know,

00:21:38.710 --> 00:21:43.590
feel like I am not seeing them
or I'm choosing not to see them

00:21:43.590 --> 00:21:46.600
for the duration of
the book, you know?

00:21:46.600 --> 00:21:48.820
And it's imperfect
because there's

00:21:48.820 --> 00:21:51.470
so many intersections
there, and there are--

00:21:51.470 --> 00:21:53.000
there's such a range
of experiences,

00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:54.300
and you're never
going it be able

00:21:54.300 --> 00:21:56.950
to capture everybody's
experience.

00:21:56.950 --> 00:22:00.760
But to me, it's something
to strive towards,

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:06.130
just kind of making more
and more people feel seen.

00:22:06.130 --> 00:22:08.650
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You create
this whole Simon verse,

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:09.950
I should say.

00:22:09.950 --> 00:22:13.150
So the sequel to Simon
is Leah on the Offbeat,

00:22:13.150 --> 00:22:16.420
where we discover
Simon's BFF is bisexual.

00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:19.760
Was that always your intention,
or were there hints in this book

00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:24.030
that I completed missed it
until the new book came out?

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.340
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: No,
it wasn't my intention.

00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:31.710
So the only person
who's like almost

00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:33.870
as oblivious as Simon is me.

00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:38.410
No, because, you know, I was
like so deep in Simon's head,

00:22:38.410 --> 00:22:40.600
to the point where there
were things that I wrote

00:22:40.600 --> 00:22:42.640
into that book, like I
wrote that book, I wrote it,

00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.700
it was there, you know, and
there were things that were

00:22:46.700 --> 00:22:51.650
like really specific signals
that a lot of people picked

00:22:51.650 --> 00:22:55.030
up on, like to the point where
I think people are surprised

00:22:55.030 --> 00:22:59.230
to hear that Leah is bi
because it was there.

00:22:59.230 --> 00:23:00.530
But Simon didn't see it.

00:23:00.530 --> 00:23:02.870
And it took me a
minute to see it.

00:23:02.870 --> 00:23:04.940
Like I had to be
like woken up to it.

00:23:04.940 --> 00:23:06.240
And it's been a couple years.

00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.870
It's not a decision
that I made recently.

00:23:08.870 --> 00:23:12.060
Like people, I've seen people,
like grandstanding on Twitter

00:23:12.060 --> 00:23:14.380
or something, being like,
she just made it that way

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.730
like because of the movie,
because of that moment

00:23:16.730 --> 00:23:18.940
with Katherine Langford,
you know,

00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:21.880
and Katherine Langford
makes this face

00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:23.980
in the Halloween scene, and
that's why Becky decided.

00:23:23.980 --> 00:23:27.050
I'm like, no, Becky talked
to Katherine Langford on set.

00:23:27.050 --> 00:23:35.110
Like this book was already
like you know, but yeah, yeah,

00:23:35.110 --> 00:23:38.490
so it's just, it's sort of
like the way I've seen these

00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:39.790
characters evolved.

00:23:39.790 --> 00:23:42.500
And I gave myself a real
gift without meaning

00:23:42.500 --> 00:23:45.420
to by making Simon
like so clueless.

00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:48.980
Like he's so-- things happen,
and he doesn't see them.

00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:51.610
Like he doesn't see like five
feet in front of his face.

00:23:51.610 --> 00:23:55.130
And he even says, and it's
not just that he's clueless

00:23:55.130 --> 00:24:00.630
in general, which he, dear
God, is, but he, like even says

00:24:00.630 --> 00:24:04.120
about Leah, and he's like,
he's like, I don't get her.

00:24:04.120 --> 00:24:07.830
Like he's just like there's this
subtext with Leah that I can't

00:24:07.830 --> 00:24:13.690
like quite like unpack
or wrap my head around.

00:24:13.690 --> 00:24:18.920
And so like having, having the
opportunity to write a book

00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:22.570
that kind of dove
into what the secret

00:24:22.570 --> 00:24:28.050
of mysterious character was
thinking and feeling and going

00:24:28.050 --> 00:24:30.790
through right under the
oblivious character's nose,

00:24:30.790 --> 00:24:32.090
like highly recommended.

00:24:32.090 --> 00:24:33.390
It's a blast.

00:24:33.390 --> 00:24:34.690
I really loved it.

00:24:34.690 --> 00:24:35.990
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Would you
say you have produced some

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:41.670
of the most successful gay
main characters nowadays.

00:24:41.670 --> 00:24:46.290
So I'm thinking you know the
wonderful responsibility you

00:24:46.290 --> 00:24:49.420
have on yourself and how the
entire LGBTQ community is

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:51.320
cheering you on, and
very thankful for that.

00:24:51.320 --> 00:24:55.920
Are you aware of how grateful
we all are for these books?

00:24:55.920 --> 00:24:57.220
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
That's really nice.

00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:58.520
Thank you.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.100
You know, and, I
mean, I'm grateful.

00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:04.650
I'm grateful to be a
part of the conversation.

00:25:04.650 --> 00:25:08.200
And I think it's
really complicated,

00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:13.040
and I think there's
things that I have come

00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.920
to understand now better

00:25:15.920 --> 00:25:18.980
than I did five years
ago when I wrote Simon.

00:25:18.980 --> 00:25:20.290
I started writing Simon just

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:25.330
about exactly five years
ago in June, you know?

00:25:25.330 --> 00:25:29.140
And, you know, I
think the conversation

00:25:29.140 --> 00:25:33.960
in young adult literary
spaces, especially those spaces

00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:37.820
that are concerned with
writing inclusive books.

00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.540
There's discussion about
ownership of stories.

00:25:40.540 --> 00:25:45.850
And it's not so much that
Simon is like a gay character,

00:25:45.850 --> 00:25:49.280
but more I think that
it's a coming out story,

00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.900
and who has a right
to tell that.

00:25:50.900 --> 00:25:54.220
And it's something
that I take seriously

00:25:54.220 --> 00:25:56.620
and I think about all the time.

00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.980
And, you know, I
don't think, you know,

00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:04.290
I was privy to those
conversations in the same way

00:26:04.290 --> 00:26:10.030
in 2013 when I wrote it.

00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:13.060
And, you know, and I think the
conversations themselves have

00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:17.270
kind of moved in
interesting ways.

00:26:17.270 --> 00:26:23.780
But I just, I try to follow it,
and, you know, it's not like--

00:26:23.780 --> 00:26:26.090
I can't like stop the train.

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:27.650
I can't like unpublish the book.

00:26:27.650 --> 00:26:30.390
And I'm really grateful
that a lot

00:26:30.390 --> 00:26:33.660
of people have connected
with it.

00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:37.190
But it's complicated, and that's
something that I'm really open

00:26:37.190 --> 00:26:39.190
with with authors
who are considering

00:26:39.190 --> 00:26:40.800
like writing outside
of their lane.

00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.040
You know, you have to sit
with the fact that like

00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:49.360
in the same day, you're going
to get e-mails from somebody

00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:53.390
who says you changed their
life, or you saved their life.

00:26:53.390 --> 00:26:55.840
And then you're going to
hear from somebody who says

00:26:55.840 --> 00:26:58.280
like you shouldn't
have written this book.

00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:01.630
You just, you have
to sit with that.

00:27:01.630 --> 00:27:02.930
Yeah.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:04.860
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: What other
YA books, or other books

00:27:04.860 --> 00:27:09.700
that you recommend to some
LBTQ teens for them to read,

00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:12.730
after they read, of
course, your three books?

00:27:12.730 --> 00:27:15.850
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: You
don't have to read mine first.

00:27:15.850 --> 00:27:18.930
First, before I even
start naming books,

00:27:18.930 --> 00:27:22.670
I want to give you a website,
because it's phenomenal.

00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:26.180
It's LGBTQ Reads.

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:31.140
And it's curated by an
author named Dahlia Adler.

00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:33.900
Her books, by the
way, are wonderful.

00:27:33.900 --> 00:27:37.110
Actually, one of them
called Under the Lights is,

00:27:37.110 --> 00:27:41.360
I would say if you
liked my books,

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:42.660
you're going to like that book.

00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:47.990
And I love that site
because it's got

00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:51.760
like really comprehensive
recommendations.

00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:55.120
And she has like
lists that kind of go

00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:58.540
into like what identities
are represented in the books,

00:27:58.540 --> 00:28:00.320
which is just like
really important to a lot

00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:03.270
of my readers I know who are
looking for representation.

00:28:03.270 --> 00:28:07.800
I really wanted to shout out
a book that came out today.

00:28:07.800 --> 00:28:11.220
It's a book birthday for them.

00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:14.920
It is an adorable
book called Running

00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:17.200
with Lions by Julian Winters.

00:28:17.200 --> 00:28:22.340
It is-- and I feel like for
years, I've heard people talking

00:28:22.340 --> 00:28:28.430
about like I want a sports
romance, but like a gay one,

00:28:28.430 --> 00:28:33.140
and this is, I feel
like this is that book,

00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:38.440
but like so like
beautifully executed.

00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:42.090
Like I don't even like
sports, but I love this book.

00:28:42.090 --> 00:28:45.550
I was just like,
it's like, it's just,

00:28:45.550 --> 00:28:48.980
it's a really subversive book
in the sense that this is a book

00:28:48.980 --> 00:28:54.160
about a soccer team, and the
coach has very deliberately

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:58.350
decided to make this team
a safe space for this group

00:28:58.350 --> 00:29:04.500
of kids who, you know, they
represent a range of identities

00:29:04.500 --> 00:29:09.900
and experiences, and it's a
love story, and it's adorable.

00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:12.150
So that book came out today.

00:29:12.150 --> 00:29:13.450
I recommend looking it up.

00:29:13.450 --> 00:29:19.200
And then-- and I could
also go on all night.

00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:25.060
But another-- this is an author
whose birthday was today.

00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:28.540
So I'm just going to stick
to the birthday theme,

00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:31.230
and then I'll leave you guys
to the website, LGBTQ Reads.

00:29:31.230 --> 00:29:37.460
So have any of you guys
heard of Adam Silvera?

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.900
[ Cheering ]

00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.430
I should have filmed that.

00:29:41.430 --> 00:29:44.090
I feel like if you've heard
of me, you've probably heard

00:29:44.090 --> 00:29:46.380
of Adam Silvera, because
he co-wrote my next book.

00:29:46.380 --> 00:29:48.040
Like we wrote together.

00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:51.060
But it's his actual
birthday today.

00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:54.620
And he has three books
that are out now.

00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:57.810
And every single one of
them is absolutely amazing.

00:29:57.810 --> 00:29:59.700
His books are sad.

00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:01.950
So just, so know that, and like

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:05.220
when you plan your reading
schedule, like read Adam's books

00:30:05.220 --> 00:30:08.500
and then read Running
with Lions,

00:30:08.500 --> 00:30:10.750
or however best you need
to like organize it.

00:30:10.750 --> 00:30:13.760
But his books are called
More Happy Than Not,

00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:17.140
History Is All You Left Me,
and if you weren't convinced

00:30:17.140 --> 00:30:19.330
that his books are sad,
They Both Die at the End,

00:30:19.330 --> 00:30:22.290
which is not a spoiler,
but it's like,

00:30:22.290 --> 00:30:24.510
like don't like get your
hopes up for them not to die.

00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:27.990
Like they both die at the end.

00:30:27.990 --> 00:30:29.290
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: But
you brought up Adam,

00:30:29.290 --> 00:30:31.140
and I know the new
book coming out,

00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.600
you're co-writing it
with him in October.

00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:34.050
I was going to ask,
this was supposed

00:30:34.050 --> 00:30:35.350
to be your last question,
but we'll talk

00:30:35.350 --> 00:30:36.650
about the movie first.

00:30:36.650 --> 00:30:37.950
But could you give us a preview

00:30:37.950 --> 00:30:39.400
of this book coming
out in October?

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.700
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Sure,

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:43.230
this is my favorite
thing to talk about.

00:30:43.230 --> 00:30:45.140
Yeah, I am so excited.

00:30:45.140 --> 00:30:48.320
So this book, What If It's
Us is like the book that Adam

00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:52.570
and I have like said
for years, since 2014,

00:30:52.570 --> 00:30:55.450
since before we ever met
in-person, we have been like,

00:30:55.450 --> 00:30:57.590
we should write this book.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:58.890
And then we did.

00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:00.190
I like can't believe we did.

00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.460
It's a book that's
coming out in October.

00:31:03.460 --> 00:31:07.700
And it's like, well,
it's definitely, by far,

00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:10.660
the most fun writing
experience I've ever had.

00:31:10.660 --> 00:31:16.010
I just like really recommend
writing books with Adam Silvera.

00:31:16.010 --> 00:31:18.510
Like, yeah, not just
because you only have

00:31:18.510 --> 00:31:21.870
to write half the book.

00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:26.400
So it's about these two
boys named Arthur and Ben.

00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:32.650
And Arthur is this
kind of like wide-eyed

00:31:32.650 --> 00:31:36.100
like Broadway geek from Georgia.

00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.660
If you look at the cover,

00:31:37.660 --> 00:31:38.960
there's a tall one
and a short one.

00:31:38.960 --> 00:31:40.860
He's the short Jewish
one from Georgia.

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.160
I wrote Arthur.

00:31:42.160 --> 00:31:47.480
And then Ben is like this kind

00:31:47.480 --> 00:31:52.260
of more cynical [inaudible] you
know, born and bred New Yorker.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.930
He's this Puerto Rican kid.

00:31:53.930 --> 00:31:55.380
He's stuck in summer school.

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.680
He's just had a breakup.

00:31:56.680 --> 00:32:01.300
And like, you know, so like
Adam's character Ben is

00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.030
like so pissed at the universe.

00:32:03.030 --> 00:32:05.670
Now he just feels like
the universe is trying

00:32:05.670 --> 00:32:08.140
to like screw him over.

00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:13.540
And my guy, Arthur, is
like, I'm in New York.

00:32:13.540 --> 00:32:14.960
Everything I know
about New York comes

00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.090
from like Broadway and movies.

00:32:17.090 --> 00:32:21.380
So he's like, obviously huge
things are going to happen

00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.300
for me and my life is like
pretty much going to be

00:32:23.300 --> 00:32:26.690
like a musical, and I'm probably
going to meet my soul mate.

00:32:26.690 --> 00:32:31.250
And so like, you know, this
is sort of where they are

00:32:31.250 --> 00:32:33.010
when they meet each
other in a post office.

00:32:33.010 --> 00:32:35.370
And like Adam's character
is like shipping stuff back

00:32:35.370 --> 00:32:38.990
to his ex-boyfriend, and my
character is like, he's cute,

00:32:38.990 --> 00:32:40.950
and I'm going to follow
him to the post office.

00:32:40.950 --> 00:32:44.750
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Is that
their big meet-cute is

00:32:44.750 --> 00:32:46.050
at the post office?

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:47.350
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
That's the big meet-cute

00:32:47.350 --> 00:32:48.650
in the post office.

00:32:48.650 --> 00:32:50.660
And then, yeah, so the gist of
it is like they get separated

00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:51.960
and they find each other again.

00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.260
But it's not like serendipity.

00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:56.420
It's more like they find each
other again relatively quickly,

00:32:56.420 --> 00:33:01.110
because, you know,
Arthur works very hard.

00:33:01.110 --> 00:33:08.970
And then, you know, I think
most of the book is them kind

00:33:08.970 --> 00:33:11.530
of dealing with-- well,

00:33:11.530 --> 00:33:15.330
they have just very
different world views.

00:33:15.330 --> 00:33:20.960
And then also, you know, their
reality of this like friendship

00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:25.900
and relationship, you know,
when it's like put up next

00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:29.230
to just the expectations
that they have, you know,

00:33:29.230 --> 00:33:34.050
it's complicated for both of
them for different reasons.

00:33:34.050 --> 00:33:35.880
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So it
comes out October what?

00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.420
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: It
comes out October 9th.

00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:39.760
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: So mark
your calendars, everyone.

00:33:39.760 --> 00:33:41.680
Why don't we talk
about the movie?

00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.300
Do you remember the time
you got, I'm not sure

00:33:44.300 --> 00:33:45.960
if it was an e-mail or a
call, that they were going

00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:48.800
to turn this book into a
movie, and how did that go?

00:33:48.800 --> 00:33:50.100
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
I actually do,

00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:52.210
but only because it
was very chaotic.

00:33:52.210 --> 00:33:57.040
For the most part, you know,
like I should say like,

00:33:57.040 --> 00:33:59.640
you know, there are these
little like steps along the way

00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.390
to like making a
book into a movie.

00:34:03.390 --> 00:34:05.730
And it's different for a
real adaptation process.

00:34:05.730 --> 00:34:08.100
But I think in general one thing

00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:11.620
that they tell us pretty
quickly is like all kinds

00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:12.940
of stuff can happen,
and they're still,

00:34:12.940 --> 00:34:15.240
they're not going make
the movie, you know?

00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.070
So you, you know,
you get these calls,

00:34:18.070 --> 00:34:19.800
and they're very exciting,
but like if you want

00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.800
to know the moment when I
realized they were going

00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:28.840
to make the movie, it was like,
I was like in the theater,

00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:31.440
and it was like, you
know, I'm like, okay,

00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:32.740
like yeah, that's the bleachers.

00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:34.040
Yep, there we go, you know?

00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.840
But I do remember getting the
call that Fox had optioned it.

00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:41.600
And I was at Barnes &amp;
Noble on a play date

00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.610
with a fellow author,
Aisha Saeed.

00:34:43.610 --> 00:34:45.920
And you should read
her book, Amal Unbound.

00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.230
That's her middle grade that
just came out, and it's amazing.

00:34:48.230 --> 00:34:51.280
And she has three little boys,
and I have two little boys,

00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:53.900
and we were about to walk
into the parking lot in front

00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:57.900
of Barnes &amp; Noble in, I think
we were in Sandy Springs,

00:34:57.900 --> 00:34:59.810
I think we were in
Simon's hometown,

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:03.210
and then I get this call.

00:35:03.210 --> 00:35:07.830
And so the hero of this
story is my friend, Aisha,

00:35:07.830 --> 00:35:14.620
who wrangled five boys, the
oldest of whom at the time was

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:18.440
like six, right by a parking
lot while I took the call

00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:22.390
that Simon was going
to be optioned by Fox.

00:35:22.390 --> 00:35:24.230
And I had no idea
what that meant.

00:35:24.230 --> 00:35:27.570
But like, and I like
did not want my kids

00:35:27.570 --> 00:35:30.650
to run into the parking lot.

00:35:30.650 --> 00:35:32.680
It's hard to know what would
have happened with that call

00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.090
if she hadn't been there.

00:35:34.090 --> 00:35:38.050
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I think
the movie perfectly kind

00:35:38.050 --> 00:35:39.710
of adapted the heart
of the book.

00:35:39.710 --> 00:35:42.920
But when you were told like, oh,
this guy who, you know, produces

00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:46.870
and directs The Flash and
Arrow and Supergirl on TV,

00:35:46.870 --> 00:35:49.350
did it ever occur to you, like,
how is he going to do this

00:35:49.350 --> 00:35:51.110
when he's doing, you
know, superheroes on TV,

00:35:51.110 --> 00:35:55.760
how is he going to do a nice
little fun teen romance?

00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:57.060
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Oh, he was [inaudible]

00:35:57.060 --> 00:36:01.820
when they told me he was
like being considered

00:36:01.820 --> 00:36:05.460
to be the director, I literally
don't remember anybody else they

00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:06.760
were considering.

00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:08.060
So I was like [inaudible]

00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:11.210
because his name had already
come up earlier in the process

00:36:11.210 --> 00:36:13.580
like with like production
companies and stuff.

00:36:13.580 --> 00:36:15.460
So I already by then
had researched him

00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:16.760
and knew who he was.

00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:18.990
One of the things that
stood out is he had worked

00:36:18.990 --> 00:36:24.870
on Dawson's Creek, and like, I
feel like I'm going to say this

00:36:24.870 --> 00:36:26.420
and you're going to know
exactly how old I am,

00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:30.220
except I already told you.

00:36:30.220 --> 00:36:34.870
Like Dawson's Creek was like my
obsession when I was a teenager.

00:36:34.870 --> 00:36:36.170
But I think more importantly,

00:36:36.170 --> 00:36:40.740
like the first time I ever
saw two boys kiss was Jack

00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:42.040
on Dawson's Creek.

00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.830
And I found out later that
Greg Berlanti is the reason

00:36:44.830 --> 00:36:46.130
that kiss happened.

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.930
Like he was writing for
the show at the time.

00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:51.980
And I believe he like, he
threatened to like quit

00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:55.030
if they cut that scene,
and they put it in.

00:36:55.030 --> 00:37:02.240
And so like Greg Berlanti has
always been pushing boundaries

00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.540
in that way.

00:37:03.540 --> 00:37:08.100
And he's somebody who cares a
lot about the representation.

00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.690
And he's also just like it was
very much a passion project

00:37:11.690 --> 00:37:12.990
for him.

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.290
That was clear like
from the beginning.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:15.590
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: How
do you feel about some

00:37:15.590 --> 00:37:17.900
of the I guess stuff that
was edited out of the book

00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.200
that were not in the movie?

00:37:19.200 --> 00:37:20.500
There's no Alice.

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:21.800
What happened to Alice?

00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:23.100
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Alice, I know.

00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:25.160
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: She went to
college and never came back.

00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:29.520
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
She never came back.

00:37:29.520 --> 00:37:34.490
I know. Yeah, Wesleyan
will do that.

00:37:34.490 --> 00:37:36.250
But, yeah, I love Wesleyan.

00:37:36.250 --> 00:37:38.760
I went to Wesleyan, guys.

00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:40.070
[ Inaudible ]

00:37:40.070 --> 00:37:43.290
But, yeah, Alice,
yeah, you know,

00:37:43.290 --> 00:37:46.780
Alice was in an earlier
version of the script,

00:37:46.780 --> 00:37:48.840
and I think it was just
one of those things.

00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:54.010
You know, in general, I tried to
be kind of like, not hands-off,

00:37:54.010 --> 00:37:57.710
but I didn't want to like be
hovering too much during the

00:37:57.710 --> 00:38:02.990
screenwriting process because
they got a screenwriter, and,

00:38:02.990 --> 00:38:05.890
you know, there's
definitely an element

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:10.230
of like they needed the space
to tell the story their own way.

00:38:10.230 --> 00:38:15.030
And then, you know, just one
of the things with, you know,

00:38:15.030 --> 00:38:20.510
just even condensing the
material from a novel to a film,

00:38:20.510 --> 00:38:24.130
like a lot of things have to
be like cut or streamlined,

00:38:24.130 --> 00:38:27.570
and Alice is a pretty-- I
mean, she's like, you know,

00:38:27.570 --> 00:38:30.490
she doesn't live at home
most of the time, you know?

00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.330
She was always kind of
on the chopping block.

00:38:32.330 --> 00:38:33.960
I just didn't know it.

00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:36.440
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Another
big thing that's missing

00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:39.010
from the movie is
the big gay bar scene

00:38:39.010 --> 00:38:42.100
from the deleted scenes
that I saw this afternoon.

00:38:42.100 --> 00:38:45.070
It starts off actually with
that weird awkward conversation

00:38:45.070 --> 00:38:48.780
between Nick and Simon
before they go to the bar.

00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:51.840
Why do you think that was
removed from the finished movie?

00:38:51.840 --> 00:38:53.790
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Oh, I
think I actually know this.

00:38:53.790 --> 00:38:55.090
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Because
Colton Haynes was in the--

00:38:55.090 --> 00:38:56.610
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: I
know, Colton Haynes was--

00:38:56.610 --> 00:38:58.910
yeah, no, I think--
oh, and actually,

00:38:58.910 --> 00:39:01.250
has anybody seen the
deleted scene yet?

00:39:01.250 --> 00:39:02.550
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:39:02.550 --> 00:39:03.850
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Okay,
a couple of you have?

00:39:03.850 --> 00:39:06.290
So you know there's like a
guy who like walks up to Nick.

00:39:06.290 --> 00:39:08.330
Not Nick Robinson, but like
George Lindberg's [phonetic]

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.210
Nick, Nick the character,
like just for a split second.

00:39:12.210 --> 00:39:14.530
That's another-- him
and Colton Haynes

00:39:14.530 --> 00:39:17.090
and Greg Berlanti
are like all friends.

00:39:17.090 --> 00:39:18.390
There's likes something.

00:39:18.390 --> 00:39:19.690
I don't know.

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.990
And the reason that they
changed that character's name

00:39:20.990 --> 00:39:23.550
to like Kevin was
because I think

00:39:23.550 --> 00:39:26.560
that guy is named Kevin
like in real life.

00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:30.060
So I think, I don't know,
basically, like this is like,

00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.860
this is a really,
like Greg didn't want

00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:36.200
to cut his buddies, you know?

00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:38.190
But this is one of those

00:39:38.190 --> 00:39:43.070
like kill your darlings things
because, you know, once,

00:39:43.070 --> 00:39:46.080
in the big picture, like once
it was all together with kind

00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:47.880
of these scenes as
the movie was kind

00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:50.940
of already getting
momentum towards the end,

00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:54.630
I think what they found is
it was such a long scene,

00:39:54.630 --> 00:39:58.110
and it just, it kind of broke

00:39:58.110 --> 00:40:00.090
up the momentum they
were trying to achieve.

00:40:00.090 --> 00:40:03.160
It's just like one of
those filmmaker things

00:40:03.160 --> 00:40:07.500
that I wouldn't have necessarily
been able to like catch

00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:09.700
if I went in the editing room.

00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.270
But I definitely get that.

00:40:11.270 --> 00:40:13.440
I'm really excited
about the deleted scene.

00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:17.130
I hadn't seen it until
like it came out digitally,

00:40:17.130 --> 00:40:19.490
and like I bought it
and like watched it.

00:40:19.490 --> 00:40:21.840
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: But they
made up for it, I should say.

00:40:21.840 --> 00:40:24.780
There's one scene in the
movie that's not in the book.

00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.130
It's that big scene with
Jennifer Garner and Simon.

00:40:27.130 --> 00:40:28.430
I rewatched it this afternoon.

00:40:28.430 --> 00:40:29.850
I was telling some of my
friends I started tearing

00:40:29.850 --> 00:40:31.150
up in my office.

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:32.450
I was thinking, what
is wrong with me?

00:40:32.450 --> 00:40:33.750
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Well,
you know, whose idea that was.

00:40:33.750 --> 00:40:35.050
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Whose was it?

00:40:35.050 --> 00:40:36.350
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Jennifer Garner's idea.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:37.650
It was Jennifer.

00:40:37.650 --> 00:40:38.950
Yeah, so like, yeah, that wasn't

00:40:38.950 --> 00:40:40.460
in the first version
of the script I saw.

00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.880
And like Jennifer, I think
she like met with Greg

00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:48.110
and she was like, I want a
scene-- and it wasn't like--

00:40:48.110 --> 00:40:50.200
I swear to God, like
I promise it's not

00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.720
like she wanted more scene time.

00:40:51.720 --> 00:40:53.170
Like she had other scenes

00:40:53.170 --> 00:40:55.650
like in the earlier
version, you know?

00:40:55.650 --> 00:40:57.820
So it wasn't about
how much screen time.

00:40:57.820 --> 00:41:00.560
It was like she wanted
that moment.

00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.900
And I think she wanted
it because she's a mom.

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:05.510
And like I've heard
her talk about this.

00:41:05.510 --> 00:41:08.910
She's like, she's like, yeah, I
wanted to be the one to say it.

00:41:08.910 --> 00:41:10.860
Like, she's like, I wanted
these lines to like be

00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:12.290
out in the universe, and
I wanted them to come

00:41:12.290 --> 00:41:14.630
from my mouth, and
like that's-- yeah.

00:41:14.630 --> 00:41:15.930
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Some
of the things she said,

00:41:15.930 --> 00:41:17.530
and I was typing
this up very fast

00:41:17.530 --> 00:41:19.340
when I was watching
it again, she says,

00:41:19.340 --> 00:41:20.940
"I need you to hear this.

00:41:20.940 --> 00:41:22.240
You are still you, Simon."

00:41:22.240 --> 00:41:26.070
Then she goes on later, says,
"you get to exhale now, Simon.

00:41:26.070 --> 00:41:27.370
You get to be more you."

00:41:27.370 --> 00:41:30.180
I mean, it's very reminiscent
of the father from Call Me

00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:31.490
By Your Name, and
this is kind of like,

00:41:31.490 --> 00:41:33.290
it's equivalent in this movie.

00:41:33.290 --> 00:41:35.170
It does make you tear up.

00:41:35.170 --> 00:41:38.130
And, of course, right after it
is the scene with Josh Duhamel

00:41:38.130 --> 00:41:40.070
in a father and son moment.

00:41:40.070 --> 00:41:44.000
And I think that's what really
resonates with a lot of kids.

00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.980
Maybe they're hoping that
their parents will be exactly,

00:41:45.980 --> 00:41:48.870
will respond the same way.

00:41:48.870 --> 00:41:50.170
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
That's what I'm hearing.

00:41:50.170 --> 00:41:51.640
And, you know, what's
interesting,

00:41:51.640 --> 00:41:54.690
I'm hearing from a lot
of kids, and the word

00:41:54.690 --> 00:41:58.350
that people really
connecting with is exhale.

00:41:58.350 --> 00:42:00.750
I've even like written
that in my handwriting

00:42:00.750 --> 00:42:05.410
for people's tattoos, like
more than one, more than one,

00:42:05.410 --> 00:42:07.920
which I'm very honored
by, because, oops, sorry,

00:42:07.920 --> 00:42:10.200
because it's not my line.

00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:12.200
Because like I love it.

00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:17.810
The one that like really hit me
in the mom bone, so-to-speak,

00:42:17.810 --> 00:42:21.940
is when she says like, you know,
you deserve everything you want.

00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.550
And then there's like a moment
where she like kisses him

00:42:24.550 --> 00:42:27.560
on the head, and she's like,
"my boy," and stuff, so like,

00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:30.050
I don't know, one of the things
I really love about that scene,

00:42:30.050 --> 00:42:32.610
about the movie in
general, is that, you know,

00:42:32.610 --> 00:42:36.020
we all have different access
points to these moments,

00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:42.190
you know, so I was on set
when that scene was filmed,

00:42:42.190 --> 00:42:46.270
and like bawling like
throughout the entire thing.

00:42:46.270 --> 00:42:47.930
So was everybody.

00:42:47.930 --> 00:42:50.560
Like there were like
reporters there that day.

00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:52.110
Fox executives were there.

00:42:52.110 --> 00:42:53.750
It was a mess.

00:42:53.750 --> 00:42:58.500
But like I, like yeah,
like she starts kisses him

00:42:58.500 --> 00:42:59.920
on the head, and
that's it for me.

00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.700
I'm done. I'm like,
I like, yeah.

00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:06.140
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Speaking
of you being on set,

00:43:06.140 --> 00:43:09.060
most of you probably don't
know that you're in the movie.

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:10.360
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
I'm in the movie, yeah.

00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:11.900
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Could you tell them

00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.320
where you are in the movie?

00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:15.300
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
This is really classy.

00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:19.170
All of my author
friends who have movies,

00:43:19.170 --> 00:43:23.350
have these like really like
poignant moments or something.

00:43:23.350 --> 00:43:26.600
Like my friend [inaudible]
is like in everything,

00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:31.040
it's like walking on a beach
with your family, you know?

00:43:31.040 --> 00:43:33.510
I'm drunk at a Halloween party.

00:43:33.510 --> 00:43:43.470
[ Laughter ]

00:43:43.470 --> 00:43:45.870
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: But do
we get to see your face?

00:43:45.870 --> 00:43:47.170
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
No, because I'm too old,

00:43:47.170 --> 00:43:49.290
and they put a mask on me.

00:43:49.290 --> 00:43:51.560
[ Laughter ]

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:54.910
You get to see my mask.

00:43:54.910 --> 00:43:58.180
I'm a bunny, and I'm drinking.

00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:01.170
But it's really because there's
like they fill those things

00:44:01.170 --> 00:44:03.540
with water, and I was nervous,

00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:08.060
so I'm like, you
know what I mean?

00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.710
Yeah, it was, you know,
it was one of those things

00:44:10.710 --> 00:44:13.580
where like I was supposed
to have a certain role

00:44:13.580 --> 00:44:15.980
in the carnival scene, but
because of the weather,

00:44:15.980 --> 00:44:17.890
they switched the days of
the filming, and then I was

00:44:17.890 --> 00:44:19.540
on book tour, and then
it was like, well,

00:44:19.540 --> 00:44:20.990
if you're having a
cameo, it's going to be

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:23.680
in the Halloween scene,
and you can't be a teacher,

00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:27.740
because even [inaudible]
is not that nerdy.

00:44:29.910 --> 00:44:35.330
And so, so yeah, so I meant
to say that I was kind

00:44:35.330 --> 00:44:40.870
of like the mid-30s, you
know, alumna of the school

00:44:40.870 --> 00:44:45.380
who provided the
alcohol, you know?

00:44:45.380 --> 00:44:48.120
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I
think we get arrested

00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:49.420
in Georgia for that, right?

00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:50.740
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
I think so, yeah.

00:44:50.740 --> 00:44:52.040
But that was, you know,

00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:53.980
not me personally,
but, I mean, my role.

00:44:53.980 --> 00:45:01.810
And Adam Silvera was also in
that role, but he was actually

00:45:01.810 --> 00:45:03.960
like a pink unicorn
with an emoji mask.

00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:07.750
So it was like really nuances,

00:45:07.750 --> 00:45:10.090
just a really incredible
portrayal

00:45:10.090 --> 00:45:14.050
of the pink unicorn
with an emoji mask.

00:45:14.050 --> 00:45:15.350
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: I think,

00:45:15.350 --> 00:45:16.650
let's take questions
from the audience.

00:45:16.650 --> 00:45:17.950
Do you have time for this?

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:19.250
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Yeah.

00:45:19.250 --> 00:45:20.550
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: All
right, there's going

00:45:20.550 --> 00:45:22.700
to be some microphones coming
down from the aisle here.

00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:25.230
And just raise your hand.

00:45:26.410 --> 00:45:28.650
I'll let you.

00:45:28.650 --> 00:45:30.080
Let's start this way.

00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:31.380
&gt;&gt; Over here?

00:45:31.380 --> 00:45:32.680
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:33.980
Thank you.

00:45:33.980 --> 00:45:35.820
Well, first of all, before I get
to the question, I just wanted

00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:37.520
to thank you again for coming.

00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:40.970
There's a lot going on in
pride in D.C. this week,

00:45:40.970 --> 00:45:42.520
and I skipped three happy hours

00:45:42.520 --> 00:45:45.510
because I was like,
I want to see you.

00:45:45.510 --> 00:45:48.630
[ Applause ]

00:45:48.630 --> 00:45:51.780
But it's to thank you.

00:45:51.780 --> 00:45:54.500
I came out four years
ago to my family.

00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:58.590
And when I did, it was heartfelt
and they were supporting

00:45:58.590 --> 00:46:01.370
and loving, but they're
reading the book presently,

00:46:01.370 --> 00:46:04.650
but they watched the movie,
and they FaceTimed me,

00:46:04.650 --> 00:46:06.910
and they said, "we never knew."

00:46:06.910 --> 00:46:09.350
They had no idea
what it felt like.

00:46:09.350 --> 00:46:12.040
So thank you for
owning my story.

00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.900
I trust you as an owner in this.

00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.040
Thank you for doing that.

00:46:16.040 --> 00:46:19.560
But now my question, what was
it actually like writing it?

00:46:19.560 --> 00:46:22.840
Like I get it's fun and
exciting to be in the movie.

00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:25.410
But what was your process,
your writing process

00:46:25.410 --> 00:46:27.460
as you were getting into the
mindset of the character?

00:46:27.460 --> 00:46:28.760
Where were you?

00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:30.060
What were you thinking?

00:46:30.060 --> 00:46:32.180
How did that go down?

00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:34.950
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
First of all, thank you.

00:46:34.950 --> 00:46:38.100
That means a lot.

00:46:38.100 --> 00:46:40.260
So the writing part,
yeah, so you're right,

00:46:40.260 --> 00:46:45.170
that is definitely less fun
than being in the movie.

00:46:45.170 --> 00:46:48.380
And right now, I'm like
drafting another book,

00:46:48.380 --> 00:46:50.790
and it's like I'm very
aware of how much less fun,

00:46:50.790 --> 00:46:54.290
like the work I'm writing
is, than like, you know,

00:46:54.290 --> 00:46:56.820
the red carpet and stuff.

00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:02.000
You know, with Simon, you
know, part of it was this kind

00:47:02.000 --> 00:47:06.190
of freedom that I can't get
back, which is the freedom

00:47:06.190 --> 00:47:08.740
of writing a book that I didn't
think would be published.

00:47:08.740 --> 00:47:14.700
I reread all of my
teen journals,

00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:20.510
which are something else.

00:47:20.510 --> 00:47:24.580
[ Laughter ]

00:47:24.580 --> 00:47:28.710
Yeah, actually, there are
parts of my teen journals

00:47:28.710 --> 00:47:30.010
that like made it into Simon,

00:47:30.010 --> 00:47:32.840
but like I'm not going
to say what parts.

00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:37.250
But like word-for-word,
some of them.

00:47:37.250 --> 00:47:42.650
You know, so I think a lot of
it is trying to kind of find

00:47:42.650 --> 00:47:46.630
that in a 16, like 17-year-old
like part of my mind.

00:47:46.630 --> 00:47:50.550
And then, you know, after
a certain point, like,

00:47:50.550 --> 00:47:54.040
and this tends to happen
with the characters

00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:58.990
that I'm writing for, is like
there are a lot of false starts,

00:47:58.990 --> 00:48:00.290
you know, when I'm writing,

00:48:00.290 --> 00:48:02.410
but eventually I
like find the voice.

00:48:02.410 --> 00:48:05.530
And once I like got
Simon's voice,

00:48:05.530 --> 00:48:08.200
then it was like
everything I wrote I got

00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:10.370
to know him better and better.

00:48:10.370 --> 00:48:11.990
So at this point, I feel
like I know him pretty well.

00:48:11.990 --> 00:48:17.020
Like people will ask me random
questions about him like online

00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.020
like out of nowhere,
like all kinds of things.

00:48:19.020 --> 00:48:22.440
And I'm like, yeah, usually
I have an answer if I think

00:48:22.440 --> 00:48:24.860
about it for a minute.

00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:26.270
Like I know him pretty well.

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:28.000
So, yeah, you know, and the
process has been different

00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.280
for every book, but that's sort
of where I was for that one.

00:48:33.270 --> 00:48:35.730
&gt;&gt; Hi, my question is
about your new book.

00:48:35.730 --> 00:48:37.460
Does it have an ending
more like your books

00:48:37.460 --> 00:48:41.000
or more like Adam's books?

00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.680
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: So will
you say the last part of that?

00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:44.840
&gt;&gt; Yeah, is the ending more like
your books, how your books end,

00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.240
or more like how
Adam's books end?

00:48:46.240 --> 00:48:47.690
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Oh,
that's a great question.

00:48:47.690 --> 00:48:49.800
So this is a question about What
If It's Us, the co-written book.

00:48:49.800 --> 00:48:55.780
So yeah, kind of as a reminder,
Adam is like notorious for like,

00:48:55.780 --> 00:48:57.540
you know, like his [inaudible]
They Both Die at the End,

00:48:57.540 --> 00:49:00.170
like these very sad books.

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:04.520
And I will say it is very
much a Becky and Adam ending.

00:49:04.520 --> 00:49:09.320
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Is it in
the Simon verse, the new book?

00:49:09.320 --> 00:49:12.300
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: No, it's
not in the Simon verse, yeah.

00:49:13.690 --> 00:49:15.840
&gt;&gt; Hi, I just wanted to say
that when the movie came out,

00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:18.710
I took all my friends, and they
didn't know anything about it.

00:49:18.710 --> 00:49:20.010
But I knew.

00:49:20.010 --> 00:49:21.310
I read the book about
a year ago.

00:49:21.310 --> 00:49:23.440
And I got all of them
instantly obsessed.

00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:25.800
Like we talk about
it all the time.

00:49:25.800 --> 00:49:27.810
So more about the books.

00:49:27.810 --> 00:49:30.340
So now that all of the Simon
verse characters are going off

00:49:30.340 --> 00:49:34.140
to college, what will
we expect from that?

00:49:34.140 --> 00:49:35.550
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: From
them going off to college?

00:49:35.550 --> 00:49:38.090
&gt;&gt; Yeah, like what would
the books continue to be,

00:49:38.090 --> 00:49:39.820
if there are any more?

00:49:39.820 --> 00:49:43.930
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Well,
I should say, and I think--

00:49:43.930 --> 00:49:49.350
I feel like I'm really
sad about this,

00:49:49.350 --> 00:49:51.300
and I know sometimes people
have been sad to hear this,

00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.270
but my intention is
for Leah on the Offbeat

00:49:54.270 --> 00:49:57.530
to be the last Simon verse book,
because it's sort of the natural

00:49:57.530 --> 00:49:59.650
like ending point
for the series.

00:49:59.650 --> 00:50:04.260
I get asked like a lot
to write, I mean a lot,

00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.060
like several times a day,
I get asked if I'm going

00:50:07.060 --> 00:50:09.100
to write either a sequel
from Simon's point of view,

00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.200
a sequel from Blue's point
of view, or rewrite Simon

00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:18.370
from Blue's point of
view, and those, I mean,

00:50:18.370 --> 00:50:20.960
Leah is the last book
in the Simon verse.

00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:25.880
But especially, especially
there's no way I would ever

00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:27.180
touch those three.

00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.480
And part of it is
because I love writing

00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:30.250
about couples getting together.

00:50:30.250 --> 00:50:33.460
Like that's why I write, like
to get to the like make-out.

00:50:33.460 --> 00:50:39.710
That's how I like sit down at my
computer, and like, it's coming.

00:50:39.710 --> 00:50:46.880
And then also I think, you
know, particularly when it comes

00:50:46.880 --> 00:50:50.110
to the Blue point of very
much book, which is the one

00:50:50.110 --> 00:50:53.450
that I get asked the most often,
you know, I try to be mindful

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:56.760
of the fact that kind
of would tap into--

00:50:56.760 --> 00:50:58.530
and I'm trying to do
this with no spoilers--

00:50:58.530 --> 00:51:00.310
but would tap into
an intersection

00:51:00.310 --> 00:51:03.530
that is severely
underrepresented right now

00:51:03.530 --> 00:51:04.950
in YA.

00:51:04.950 --> 00:51:07.550
And because of its
connection to Simon,

00:51:07.550 --> 00:51:12.670
it would be like a big
book right now, you know?

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:17.470
And that doesn't need to
be a book written by me.

00:51:17.470 --> 00:51:20.960
&gt;&gt; Hi, so my friend and I,

00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:23.810
we really love your
books and the movie.

00:51:23.810 --> 00:51:25.110
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Could you stand up

00:51:25.110 --> 00:51:29.390
and show everyone your T-shirts?

00:51:29.390 --> 00:51:30.690
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:51:30.690 --> 00:51:31.990
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
You're in pairs.

00:51:31.990 --> 00:51:33.290
You should show it.

00:51:33.290 --> 00:51:35.090
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
That's so great.

00:51:35.090 --> 00:51:39.930
[ Laughter ]

00:51:39.930 --> 00:51:46.960
&gt;&gt; So my question is, what made
you choose Bram to be Blue?

00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.540
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Are we
okay with me getting into this?

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.940
Is this like kind of a--
if you're here, right,

00:51:52.940 --> 00:51:54.240
you've seen the movie at least?

00:51:54.240 --> 00:52:01.540
Okay, I always, I always
knew he was going to be Blue,

00:52:01.540 --> 00:52:04.530
which is interesting,
because that makes me,

00:52:04.530 --> 00:52:07.570
I think one the one
person who got to know him

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:10.420
as Bram first, you know?

00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:16.590
And I think, you
know, my idea of him

00:52:16.590 --> 00:52:18.390
as Bram informed my writing.

00:52:18.390 --> 00:52:21.190
Like every e-mail I wrote
from Blue's perspective,

00:52:21.190 --> 00:52:28.620
like I knew he was Bram, so I
was writing Bram, and, you know,

00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:34.350
I think, you know, it's
interesting trying to think back

00:52:34.350 --> 00:52:37.070
to like why I chose him,
because he just like, you know,

00:52:37.070 --> 00:52:42.570
he was always-- he was Bram, he
was, you know, that nerdy like,

00:52:42.570 --> 00:52:45.510
I don't know, who
wouldn't choose him?

00:52:45.510 --> 00:52:51.110
[ Inaudible ]

00:52:51.110 --> 00:52:56.800
Yeah, he, yeah, and
I think, you know,

00:52:56.800 --> 00:53:00.980
some of the privileged
stuff that Simon has

00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:04.740
to like unpack along the
way, that kind of wove itself

00:53:04.740 --> 00:53:09.240
into the story of us, like
that wasn't necessarily

00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.900
like the thing I set

00:53:10.900 --> 00:53:15.210
out to write a book
about, but, you know.

00:53:15.210 --> 00:53:19.460
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: We could
probably take two more

00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:21.320
questions here.

00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:24.480
&gt;&gt; Okay, so as a young
writer, and as a person really,

00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:27.050
your writing has
really inspired me.

00:53:27.050 --> 00:53:28.370
Who are some of the authors

00:53:28.370 --> 00:53:32.230
that have inspired
you in your writing?

00:53:32.230 --> 00:53:34.750
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: So I, you
know, I think, I always say

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:43.110
like there are two like books,
authors, who made me want

00:53:43.110 --> 00:53:48.490
to be a writer, or I think most
kind of influenced like the type

00:53:48.490 --> 00:53:49.790
of writing I like to do.

00:53:49.790 --> 00:53:55.420
One is Stephen Chbosky, like
The Perks of Being a Wallflower,

00:53:55.420 --> 00:53:57.950
which I read when I was like 16.

00:53:57.950 --> 00:54:01.460
And, you know, I was so in love

00:54:01.460 --> 00:54:02.990
with Charlie, the
main character.

00:54:02.990 --> 00:54:05.890
And I just, I felt
so connected to him.

00:54:05.890 --> 00:54:10.990
And the other author is an
Australian YA author named

00:54:10.990 --> 00:54:12.340
Jaclyn Moriarty.

00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:15.080
Actually, her sister is like
really famous right now.

00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:19.020
Like her sister is like
Liane Moriarty who writes

00:54:19.020 --> 00:54:21.470
like women's fiction
books that are huge.

00:54:21.470 --> 00:54:24.610
Is it like Big Little
Lies, I think?

00:54:24.610 --> 00:54:25.910
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
That little movie.

00:54:25.910 --> 00:54:28.450
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Yeah, well, I'm like a fan

00:54:28.450 --> 00:54:29.750
of her sister primarily.

00:54:29.750 --> 00:54:33.080
I actually like Liane's
books too a lot.

00:54:33.080 --> 00:54:35.980
Yeah, no, so her sister
has written this series

00:54:35.980 --> 00:54:40.000
of contemporary books
that, yeah, they take place

00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.650
at like this high
school in Australia,

00:54:42.650 --> 00:54:45.620
and I think what I love about
them is similar to what I love

00:54:45.620 --> 00:54:47.330
about The Perks of Being
a Wallflower is just

00:54:47.330 --> 00:54:51.250
like these characters feel
so real, like they feel

00:54:51.250 --> 00:54:56.570
like actual people you could
know, and they, you know,

00:54:56.570 --> 00:55:01.560
and it doesn't feel like,
you know, the author tried

00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.900
to like infuse them
with quirks, you know,

00:55:04.900 --> 00:55:06.390
that would be memorable.

00:55:06.390 --> 00:55:10.190
Like it doesn't feel, like
you don't feel the craft

00:55:10.190 --> 00:55:11.610
when you read it.

00:55:11.610 --> 00:55:14.160
The craft is obviously there.

00:55:14.160 --> 00:55:20.190
But I think to me that's always
been my priority as a writer is

00:55:20.190 --> 00:55:25.380
to like make characters
who feel real.

00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:31.500
&gt;&gt; All right, so, hi, so I just
want to say that last year,

00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:33.170
Simon was like the
first book that I read

00:55:33.170 --> 00:55:36.050
that really got me back
into reading again.

00:55:36.050 --> 00:55:39.700
And even as like a 20-year-old
woman, I still could relate

00:55:39.700 --> 00:55:43.720
to a lot of the things
that Simon was like feeling

00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:46.160
from when I was like at that
point in my life where he was.

00:55:46.160 --> 00:55:50.690
And so I just want to say that
that book kind of inspired me

00:55:50.690 --> 00:55:52.050
to want to write my own book.

00:55:52.050 --> 00:55:56.000
So my question is, like,
what advice would you have

00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:58.830
for somebody who would want to
write like a YA book one day?

00:55:58.830 --> 00:56:02.320
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: So
I, I'm going to give kind

00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:09.990
of my two favorite
pieces of advice.

00:56:09.990 --> 00:56:16.630
And I'm not-- and I should
kind of give the disclaimer

00:56:16.630 --> 00:56:22.310
that I don't have the
kind of like classical

00:56:22.310 --> 00:56:24.590
like writing training that
a lot of authors have.

00:56:24.590 --> 00:56:26.530
So I don't have an MFA.

00:56:26.530 --> 00:56:29.190
I don't know like bait
sheets and things like that.

00:56:29.190 --> 00:56:31.240
And there's things
like save the cat.

00:56:31.240 --> 00:56:36.870
And I'm like, I love
cats, you know?

00:56:36.870 --> 00:56:42.900
So my most important piece of
advice is to write fan fiction

00:56:42.900 --> 00:56:48.450
because I think, because I think
it is the best writing practice

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:49.820
out there.

00:56:49.820 --> 00:56:53.510
And not just because you're just
like actually like putting words

00:56:53.510 --> 00:56:56.360
on paper, but that is really,
really important to like just be

00:56:56.360 --> 00:56:58.050
like doing the thing,
getting used to doing it.

00:56:58.050 --> 00:57:02.890
But, you know, I think that
you are specifically trying

00:57:02.890 --> 00:57:07.530
to like aim for a voice, you
know, and like hit that target.

00:57:07.530 --> 00:57:11.970
And I think like when you
start to be able to like,

00:57:11.970 --> 00:57:17.850
to nail that with, you know,
existing characters, it becomes,

00:57:17.850 --> 00:57:21.310
like if you're trying to do
it with original characters,

00:57:21.310 --> 00:57:23.830
it's a different process,
but there's something

00:57:23.830 --> 00:57:25.130
about it that feels similar.

00:57:25.130 --> 00:57:27.580
Also, if you write like Leah
on the Offbeat, like the sequel

00:57:27.580 --> 00:57:31.120
in the same universe, it really
is like fan fiction, you know?

00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.590
Like pretty much, yeah.

00:57:32.590 --> 00:57:38.140
And then the other thing is
maybe even more important,

00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.330
which is like find your
community, you know,

00:57:42.330 --> 00:57:44.770
whether that's like
other authors,

00:57:44.770 --> 00:57:50.010
or just like bookish
people who are sort of going

00:57:50.010 --> 00:57:52.700
through some aspect of
the process with you.

00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.460
But like, you know, it
could be like a librarian

00:57:55.460 --> 00:57:57.520
or something like that.

00:57:57.520 --> 00:58:03.600
I 100% would not still
be writing were it not

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:07.600
for my author friends, my
little squad of author friends.

00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.900
I would not be writing.

00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:12.440
I would have quit about
two months ago or so.

00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.740
I don't know.

00:58:13.740 --> 00:58:15.040
You all know.

00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.340
It's when I left Twitter.

00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.640
I was done.

00:58:17.640 --> 00:58:18.940
I was done with writing.

00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.840
The reason I'm still writing
is because of my friends.

00:58:20.840 --> 00:58:23.550
And that's not the first
time I almost quit.

00:58:23.550 --> 00:58:28.180
So find those guys and like
hold them really tight.

00:58:28.180 --> 00:58:29.480
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Speaking of your friends,

00:58:29.480 --> 00:58:31.570
you speak very highly of Adam,

00:58:31.570 --> 00:58:32.870
and you said it was
his birthday.

00:58:32.870 --> 00:58:34.680
I say, why don't we
end this evening,

00:58:34.680 --> 00:58:36.470
why don't we have the entire
audience sing happy birthday

00:58:36.470 --> 00:58:37.870
to him, and we can
send this video

00:58:37.870 --> 00:58:39.170
and tweet it to him, right?

00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:40.470
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Wait.

00:58:40.470 --> 00:58:41.770
My purse is in the green room.

00:58:41.770 --> 00:58:43.590
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Oh,
somebody could film it.

00:58:43.590 --> 00:58:45.970
We have all these
cameras around too.

00:58:45.970 --> 00:58:47.270
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli: Yeah.

00:58:47.270 --> 00:58:48.570
Oh, yeah, yeah, can we do that?

00:58:48.570 --> 00:58:49.870
Oh, he'll love that.

00:58:49.870 --> 00:58:51.170
Oh, this is so great.

00:58:51.170 --> 00:58:52.470
Yeah.

00:58:52.470 --> 00:58:53.770
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Are
you guys game for it?

00:58:53.770 --> 00:58:55.070
Because I'm not going
to be singing here

00:58:55.070 --> 00:58:56.370
by myself, I should say.

00:58:56.370 --> 00:58:57.670
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
I'll hold the camera.

00:58:57.670 --> 00:58:58.970
Can I hold the camera?

00:58:58.970 --> 00:59:00.270
Thank you so much.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:02.430
And you'll just like text
this to me, and I can send it?

00:59:02.430 --> 00:59:03.730
Thank you so much.

00:59:03.730 --> 00:59:05.030
That's awesome.

00:59:05.030 --> 00:59:07.280
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina:
Let me stand up.

00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.860
Do you want to do a
little introduction?

00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.160
I'll give it to you.

00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:11.460
I'll shoot you.

00:59:11.460 --> 00:59:12.760
You can say it.

00:59:12.760 --> 00:59:15.930
Then I'll-- right.

00:59:15.930 --> 00:59:17.360
Go.

00:59:17.360 --> 00:59:18.660
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Hi, Addy [phonetic],

00:59:18.660 --> 00:59:21.810
we are at the Library of
Congress, and a couple

00:59:21.810 --> 00:59:24.700

[ Applause ]

00:59:56.500 --> 00:59:58.230
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: You could
say something and close it.

00:59:58.230 --> 00:59:59.530
&gt;&gt; Becky Albertalli:
Oh, I'm still live?

00:59:59.530 --> 01:00:00.830
&gt;&gt; Roswell Encina: Yes.

01:00:00.830 --> 01:00:02.210

And thank you, Becky.

01:00:07.210 --> 01:00:08.510
