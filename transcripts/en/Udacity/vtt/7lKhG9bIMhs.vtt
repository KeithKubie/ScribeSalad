00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:02.160
Here were the correct answers.

00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:06.670
Doctor visits per year is an ordered data type, life expectancy is and

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:09.580
spending per person are both quantitative data types, and

00:00:09.580 --> 00:00:13.020
has universal healthcare is a nominal data type.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.582
Now among these four variables,

00:00:14.582 --> 00:00:17.860
I think doctor visits per year was probably the hardest to identify.

00:00:17.860 --> 00:00:19.530
Let's take a look at why.

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:22.960
Average number of doctor visits per year is represented by the size of

00:00:22.960 --> 00:00:24.500
these circles.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:28.450
And if we look closely we can see that each of these circles corresponds to

00:00:28.450 --> 00:00:29.000
a range.

00:00:30.290 --> 00:00:32.980
So basically we've taken quantitative data and

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:38.350
split it up into bins which makes this data type an ordered data type.

00:00:38.350 --> 00:00:41.070
Average life expectancy at birth and spending per

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:45.740
person are both quantitative data types just like in the graph we saw before.

00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:46.300
And whether or not

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.630
a country has health insurance is really just a nominal data type.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:51.660
It's really a yes or no question.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:52.900
So that's two categories
