- You do have to
reinvent yourself.

00:00:02.335 --> 00:00:03.536 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
I remember a therapist
telling me that,

00:00:03.536 --> 00:00:05.038
she's like everyone
in show business

00:00:05.038 --> 00:00:06.339 align:start size:88% position:13%
you have to
- She specifically said

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:08.742
you need to reinvent yourself,

00:00:08.742 --> 00:00:10.410
you know I've seen your act.

00:00:10.410 --> 00:00:12.512
- Dye your hair blonde.

00:00:12.512 --> 00:00:13.847
- She's here like you've
never said a funny thing

00:00:13.847 --> 00:00:15.782
in your life, you're never funny

00:00:15.782 --> 00:00:17.617 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I'm like that's
not what I'm here for.

00:00:17.617 --> 00:00:18.852
But I remember her saying that

00:00:18.852 --> 00:00:20.653
- Somebody sent
me to a therapist

00:00:20.653 --> 00:00:22.322
about eight years ago
and I'm not gonna say

00:00:22.322 --> 00:00:24.557
who sent me but he said you
should go see this therapist

00:00:24.557 --> 00:00:26.659 align:start size:97% position:3%
to deal with like, you
know I was getting backlash

00:00:26.659 --> 00:00:28.528 align:start size:81% position:19%
and haters and
all the stuff that

00:00:28.528 --> 00:00:30.530 align:start size:84% position:16%
that I wasn't prepared
for was going on,

00:00:30.530 --> 00:00:32.265
he goes you should
go to this therapist

00:00:32.265 --> 00:00:34.667 align:start size:84% position:16%
he works with all
comedians he gets us.

00:00:34.667 --> 00:00:36.569 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh dear.
- He speaks our language.

00:00:36.569 --> 00:00:37.837
He knows the jargon.

00:00:37.837 --> 00:00:39.472 align:start size:81% position:19%
- Oh he knows what
Montreal means.

00:00:39.472 --> 00:00:41.508
(laughs)

00:00:41.508 --> 00:00:43.076
That's what they always
say about that therapist,

00:00:43.076 --> 00:00:44.411
I know who you're talking about.

00:00:44.411 --> 00:00:45.879
- I get into this
therapy session

00:00:45.879 --> 00:00:47.380 align:start size:94% position:6%
literally the first
thing this guy says to me

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:49.115
sitting straight across me,
put his hand on his legs

00:00:49.115 --> 00:00:52.685 align:start size:97% position:3%
he goes Dane Cook, your
name comes up a lot in here.

00:00:52.685 --> 00:00:54.921
- [Everyone] Oh my god!

00:00:54.921 --> 00:00:56.022
- [Nikki] Of course it
does, of course it does.

00:00:57.223 --> 00:00:59.159 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was just broken
in half at that point.

00:00:59.159 --> 00:01:00.160
(laughs)

00:01:00.160 --> 00:01:03.096
(rock music)

00:01:03.096 --> 00:01:05.298 line:0%
- And we're back at You
Up with Nikki Glaser

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:07.500 align:start size:81% position:19% line:0%
in studio we've
got Andrew Collin,

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:11.571 line:0%
Shulli Egar, and now
Dane, again, Cook.

00:01:12.839 --> 00:01:13.973
(applause)

00:01:13.973 --> 00:01:14.908
Dane Cook is here.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:15.842
- I led my own applause praise.

00:01:15.842 --> 00:01:17.410
- Yeah you started it out.

00:01:17.410 --> 00:01:20.447 align:start size:88% position:13%
Dane Cook is here
kicking off a huge tour.

00:01:20.447 --> 00:01:23.850
You haven't been on
tour, a big, a tour

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:25.318
- Since 1984.

00:01:25.318 --> 00:01:26.820
(laughs)

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:29.055
- 2013 I mean that's a while.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:31.524
- I know it was,
you know how it is,

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.259 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's like when you're
cultivating new material

00:01:33.259 --> 00:01:34.727
sometimes you're on a groove

00:01:34.727 --> 00:01:35.929
and it comes together in a year,

00:01:35.929 --> 00:01:37.497 align:start size:88% position:13%
a year and a half you're
like I'm good to go,

00:01:37.497 --> 00:01:39.466
and then there's other
times in your life where

00:01:39.466 --> 00:01:42.168
I've been doing it 29 years,
you're still going through

00:01:42.168 --> 00:01:45.138
like an evolution of
really perspectives,

00:01:45.138 --> 00:01:47.140
and being introspective,

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.609
that all need to lend
itself to our material.

00:01:49.609 --> 00:01:51.678
So I took a little more
time with it this time

00:01:51.678 --> 00:01:54.347 align:start size:94% position:6%
because I felt like I
wanted to get it perfect.

00:01:54.347 --> 00:01:57.183
- I'm excited because you were,

00:01:57.183 --> 00:02:00.720
that's true, you were
so famous and so huge,

00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.158
so quickly, then you came out
with special special special

00:02:05.158 --> 00:02:07.694
because the demand
was, you needed to

00:02:07.694 --> 00:02:08.962
- Yes.

00:02:08.962 --> 00:02:11.564
- And you could, I
mean, you did it.

00:02:11.564 --> 00:02:13.967
But I'm interested to see
what what's happened now

00:02:13.967 --> 00:02:16.302
with this five years gap, where,

00:02:16.302 --> 00:02:19.305 align:start size:97% position:3%
what kind of material, what's
been the shift for you?

00:02:19.305 --> 00:02:20.406
- Yeah you know,
did you see the,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:21.975 align:start size:84% position:16%
you saw the Channeling
documentary?

00:02:21.975 --> 00:02:23.510
- Yes.

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:25.478
- The thing about that that
kind of congealed everything

00:02:25.478 --> 00:02:27.447
for me is I grew
up loving Carling

00:02:27.447 --> 00:02:30.850
and this an unbelievable moment.

00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:32.852 align:start size:88% position:13%
Carling was doing the
hippy dippy weather man,

00:02:32.852 --> 00:02:35.088 align:start size:84% position:16%
he had the cardboard
cutout of himself

00:02:35.088 --> 00:02:37.524
that he brought out on I
guess the tonight show,

00:02:37.524 --> 00:02:40.360
and in this prolific
moment he walked out,

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:41.861
he used, you know
it was lucrative,

00:02:41.861 --> 00:02:43.630 align:start size:94% position:6%
the hippy dippy weather
man was doing well for him

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.064
and everybody knew him as that,

00:02:45.064 --> 00:02:47.767 align:start size:97% position:3%
so he brought the cardboard
cutout out and he said

00:02:47.767 --> 00:02:51.104
he was like, lot of
people know this guy

00:02:51.104 --> 00:02:54.274 line:0%
he was hilarious,
we all loved him,

00:02:54.274 --> 00:02:57.510 line:0%
but this guy, and he dropped
his own picture out of frame,

00:02:57.510 --> 00:02:59.078
he goes is gone.

00:02:59.078 --> 00:03:02.182
I'm George Carlin,
alright let's start.

00:03:02.182 --> 00:03:03.116
- [Nikki] Wow.

00:03:03.116 --> 00:03:04.083
- And it was this dead silence

00:03:04.083 --> 00:03:05.285
cause everybody was like what

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.020
what is this gonna be
- He shot it down.

00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:07.854
- He shot it down.

00:03:07.854 --> 00:03:09.055
And that was even really

00:03:09.055 --> 00:03:11.057 align:start size:88% position:13%
before I got into stand
up comedy full time

00:03:11.057 --> 00:03:14.627
and I thought oh wait, you
can evolve in this business,

00:03:14.627 --> 00:03:16.796
you don't have to
stay as one thing

00:03:16.796 --> 00:03:19.532 align:start size:84% position:16%
or, people will pigeon
hole you and say

00:03:19.532 --> 00:03:20.867
you're the guy that
rips his shirt off

00:03:20.867 --> 00:03:22.902
and his pants saying you
pour water on yourself

00:03:22.902 --> 00:03:24.671
and that's what you do forever.

00:03:24.671 --> 00:03:26.739
But I already looked at this now

00:03:26.739 --> 00:03:29.509 align:start size:94% position:6%
I can grow up with a
generation of comedy fans.

00:03:29.509 --> 00:03:32.078
- I love that, you always kill
it on these late night shows,

00:03:32.078 --> 00:03:33.680 align:start size:94% position:6%
you're one of my favorite
late night guest,

00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:37.350 align:start position:0%
and you have been since, I
remember when you went on chemo

00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:40.086 align:start size:84% position:16%
right after the
Tom Cruise incident

00:03:40.086 --> 00:03:43.089 align:start size:97% position:3%
where he jumped on the couch
- Jumped on the couch.

00:03:43.089 --> 00:03:44.257
- On Oprah.

00:03:44.257 --> 00:03:46.125 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Did I chase somebody
into a bathroom?

00:03:46.125 --> 00:03:47.560
- Dude, you were so funny!

00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:49.028 align:start size:88% position:13%
And I pulled it up
- yeah he sent it to me

00:03:49.028 --> 00:03:51.397 align:start size:84% position:16%
it was unbelievable.
- A month ago.

00:03:51.397 --> 00:03:53.066
- Who did I chase
into a restroom?

00:03:53.066 --> 00:03:54.801
- You, it was some
actress that you had

00:03:54.801 --> 00:03:56.603
stationed in, because (laughs)

00:03:56.603 --> 00:03:59.172
because if you don't remember

00:03:59.172 --> 00:04:02.208
when tom Cruise was on
Oprah he went to go fetch

00:04:02.208 --> 00:04:05.311 align:start size:94% position:6%
Katie Holmes backstage
and made like a huge thing

00:04:05.311 --> 00:04:07.313 align:start size:94% position:6%
about it, but she had
like a thing on her lips,

00:04:07.313 --> 00:04:08.781 align:start size:84% position:16%
so she didn't
wanna be on camera,

00:04:08.781 --> 00:04:10.550
and he's like come on Katie.

00:04:10.550 --> 00:04:15.154 align:start size:97% position:3%
So you, you come out on chemo
just so committed to look

00:04:15.154 --> 00:04:17.490
I'm in love (yells) I'm in love,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.525 align:start size:81% position:19%
and just doing the
best impression

00:04:19.525 --> 00:04:20.593 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I had a tattoo but
it was a magazine

00:04:20.593 --> 00:04:22.061
that I taped in my back.

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:25.598
- It was so funny, you
have to watch Dane Cooke,

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:28.301
Jimmy Kimel, Tom cruise,
just search those words,

00:04:28.301 --> 00:04:31.104
it is such, you're
so committed to that

00:04:31.104 --> 00:04:33.239
and it wasn't like
something you would,

00:04:33.239 --> 00:04:35.108
it wasn't the Dane
Cook that we knew

00:04:35.108 --> 00:04:38.711 align:start position:0%
at that point which was, I mean
you're not an impressionist

00:04:38.711 --> 00:04:41.648
like that wasn't what
I expected out of you.

00:04:41.648 --> 00:04:43.349
But it was so killer.

00:04:43.349 --> 00:04:45.385
- Yeah Kimal has always
been like that place

00:04:45.385 --> 00:04:48.121
that they let you
go and try things

00:04:48.121 --> 00:04:49.555
that are out of your lane

00:04:49.555 --> 00:04:51.090 align:start size:97% position:3%
or whatever it is the
perspective which is great.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:52.525
- But that could
have gone so badly.

00:04:52.525 --> 00:04:53.459
- Oh yeah.

00:04:53.459 --> 00:04:54.961
- It was so, that was a whole

00:04:54.961 --> 00:04:57.096
- I'm sure there's another
clip you can look up online

00:04:57.096 --> 00:04:58.765
(laughs)

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:00.733
we'll dig those up so you
can see some of the ones

00:05:00.733 --> 00:05:02.602
where it didn't go so great.

00:05:02.602 --> 00:05:05.505 align:start size:97% position:3%
- But I love the fact that,
in your mind as a comic

00:05:05.505 --> 00:05:07.006
and as a performer you're like,

00:05:07.006 --> 00:05:08.274
this has to go somewhere,
and I'm just gonna walk

00:05:08.274 --> 00:05:10.677
out there and just talk
like, I wanna do some,

00:05:10.677 --> 00:05:12.178 align:start size:88% position:13%
I wanna bring
something to the table.

00:05:12.178 --> 00:05:13.413
- My comedy from the beginning,

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:15.815
I grew up I was a real
introvert, you know,

00:05:15.815 --> 00:05:19.018
I had anxiety and panic
attacks, I was like,

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.853 align:start size:81% position:19%
I had no social
skills whatsoever.

00:05:20.853 --> 00:05:23.056
So anytime I got on
stage, and the fact

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.792
that I even ever
stood on a stage

00:05:25.792 --> 00:05:28.094
when I couldn't be in
front of, you know,

00:05:28.094 --> 00:05:29.962
even at the bus stop
waiting to go to school

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:32.598
I was panicking, it
was like torture.

00:05:32.598 --> 00:05:34.500
So it's like every
single opportunity

00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:37.270 align:start size:84% position:16%
I have to get up
there, I wanna commit.

00:05:37.270 --> 00:05:39.405
Everything I had
because I loved it.

00:05:39.405 --> 00:05:41.808
I hated being off stage,
I was more scared in life

00:05:41.808 --> 00:05:44.177
than I was of how
I felt on stage.

00:05:44.177 --> 00:05:46.312 align:start size:94% position:6%
And I think that's
permitted my entire career

00:05:46.312 --> 00:05:48.581
of like, I gotta take
full advantage of this

00:05:48.581 --> 00:05:51.017 align:start size:84% position:16%
while I can be out
here and feeling this,

00:05:51.017 --> 00:05:53.886
the bravado that comes
with standing on stage.

00:05:53.886 --> 00:05:55.221 align:start size:84% position:16%
- So you don't
take it for granted

00:05:55.221 --> 00:05:57.023 align:start size:84% position:16%
every time you go
on stage, you really

00:05:57.023 --> 00:05:58.224
- Never.

00:05:58.224 --> 00:05:59.759 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Cause I heard
you talk about that

00:05:59.759 --> 00:06:01.361
and I'm always like I wish I
felt the way about the stage

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.696 align:start size:97% position:3%
that Dane Cook feels
because I've heard you talk

00:06:03.696 --> 00:06:06.232
about this feeling of I
just want to get up there

00:06:06.232 --> 00:06:07.934
and you cherish every movement

00:06:07.934 --> 00:06:12.305 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah yeah it's
always been glamorous.

00:06:12.305 --> 00:06:13.639
Ever since I saw
when I was a kid

00:06:13.639 --> 00:06:15.608
watching Johnny Carson
growing up, or Carling,

00:06:15.608 --> 00:06:18.945 align:start position:0%
or Prior, it was like I watched
all these amazing comedians

00:06:18.945 --> 00:06:23.082 align:start size:88% position:13%
and to me it always felt
like wow that's like,

00:06:23.082 --> 00:06:25.952 align:start size:94% position:6%
that's a occupation where
you're always needed

00:06:25.952 --> 00:06:27.420 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Yeah.
- To some extend you know?

00:06:27.420 --> 00:06:29.455
And I think I wanted to
feel that growing up,

00:06:29.455 --> 00:06:32.558
I wanted to feel like
needed, I had a place.

00:06:32.558 --> 00:06:34.327
So once I locked
into it I was like

00:06:34.327 --> 00:06:35.695
this is what I'm good at,

00:06:35.695 --> 00:06:38.131 align:start position:0%
I suck at pretty much
everything else in the world so

00:06:38.131 --> 00:06:39.399
I just give it all I got.

00:06:39.399 --> 00:06:40.633
- Well I wanna go back
to something you said

00:06:40.633 --> 00:06:42.301
about just having
extreme anxiety

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:43.870
I was the same way growing up I,

00:06:43.870 --> 00:06:45.505 align:start size:94% position:6%
giving class presentations
I would just,

00:06:45.505 --> 00:06:48.007
I would have panic attacks,
I wouldn't be able to sleep

00:06:48.007 --> 00:06:50.843 align:start size:94% position:6%
for three days before
because I was so nervous.

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:53.179 align:start size:94% position:6%
Everything in my childhood
you would have looked

00:06:53.179 --> 00:06:54.447
at me as a child you'd be like

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:56.416
that girl will never
be a stand up comedian.

00:06:56.416 --> 00:06:58.885
And you were having panic
attacks at the bus stop,

00:06:58.885 --> 00:07:01.587
how does one overcome that?

00:07:01.587 --> 00:07:03.389 align:start size:97% position:3%
If you're listening, someone's
listening now being like

00:07:03.389 --> 00:07:04.757
I wanna do stand
up comedy but it's,

00:07:04.757 --> 00:07:06.993
I'm too scared, what do you find

00:07:06.993 --> 00:07:09.262
that was, made you
be able to do it?

00:07:09.262 --> 00:07:12.331
- I think that I
was funny at home,

00:07:12.331 --> 00:07:14.033
I would get home and I
felt like that was just,

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:16.169
I was safe you know,
so I could do skits

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.337 align:start size:84% position:16%
or I would, you know,
prank phone calls

00:07:18.337 --> 00:07:21.140
with my little radio
shack plug in you know,

00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:23.309 align:start size:84% position:16%
I would make my own
Jerkey boy type calls,

00:07:23.309 --> 00:07:26.279 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I got a rush out
of getting laughs

00:07:26.279 --> 00:07:28.381
if I would play for a
couple of my friends

00:07:28.381 --> 00:07:31.317
or my family, and so I think,

00:07:31.317 --> 00:07:33.953
I remember watching Martin
Short on Saturday Night Live

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.589 align:start size:84% position:16%
when I was like
seven or eight grade,

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.057
and he was doing Ed Grimly,

00:07:38.057 --> 00:07:40.760 align:start size:94% position:6%
he was doing Jacky Roberts
Junior 100 000 dollars

00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.765 align:start size:84% position:16%
jackpot won, and he
just, he was so happy.

00:07:46.499 --> 00:07:47.767
He was so into it.

00:07:47.767 --> 00:07:50.303
And I wanted that really
desperately in my life.

00:07:50.303 --> 00:07:52.705 align:start size:94% position:6%
And so I thought I'm gonna
try an open mic night,

00:07:52.705 --> 00:07:54.907
and how that happened was kind
of a quick story interesting

00:07:54.907 --> 00:07:57.577 align:start position:0%
I was in Cambridge Massachusetts
at Catch Rising Star,

00:07:57.577 --> 00:08:01.214 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was watching David Cross
was doing his own cross comedy

00:08:01.214 --> 00:08:03.049 align:start size:84% position:16%
within open mic night,
so he do sketches

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:05.551
then he bring part
luck performers up.

00:08:05.551 --> 00:08:08.187 align:start size:97% position:3%
You'd sign up and then
you'd show up the next week,

00:08:08.187 --> 00:08:09.655
and if he called your name
you got pulled up on stage.

00:08:09.655 --> 00:08:12.558
Well I was just going to
watch cause I was terrified

00:08:12.558 --> 00:08:14.727 align:start size:94% position:6%
at actually going up
there, and the third week,

00:08:14.727 --> 00:08:17.730
the host went up and said
okay, next on the list

00:08:17.730 --> 00:08:21.167 align:start size:97% position:3%
and they would randomly call
you where's Ernest Glen?

00:08:21.167 --> 00:08:22.401 align:start size:84% position:16%
And there's like three
seconds of nothing,

00:08:22.401 --> 00:08:23.669
then I knew this
guy wasn't there,

00:08:23.669 --> 00:08:24.871
they were gonna move
on to the next name,

00:08:24.871 --> 00:08:26.973
I put my hand up, he
goes you're Ernest Glen

00:08:26.973 --> 00:08:28.207
I say yeah and he goes alright

00:08:28.207 --> 00:08:29.742
all the way from the
fifth row Ernest Glen.

00:08:29.742 --> 00:08:32.111
And that was my first set ever.

00:08:32.111 --> 00:08:34.780
And once I did it it felt
the way I did up there

00:08:34.780 --> 00:08:37.950 align:start size:88% position:13%
I said this is, I gotta
- I'm Ernest now.

00:08:37.950 --> 00:08:39.318
- I gotta do it again.

00:08:39.318 --> 00:08:40.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm Ernest Glenn
- Identity theft I love it.

00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.021
Old school.

00:08:42.021 --> 00:08:45.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
- What happened the next
week when you were Dane Cook?

00:08:45.925 --> 00:08:47.593 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I never found this
Ernest Glenn guy either.

00:08:47.593 --> 00:08:50.229
There was never an Ernest
Glenn in Boston comedy

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:52.798
and I would Facebook try to
find him from time to time

00:08:52.798 --> 00:08:54.233
I wanted to thank him.

00:08:54.233 --> 00:08:55.735 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It'd be great if you
crushed and you couldn't go

00:08:55.735 --> 00:08:57.603
by your regular name, and then
that guy just said somewhere

00:08:57.603 --> 00:09:00.172
Ernest Glenn HPS
fest what the fuck?

00:09:00.172 --> 00:09:02.341
- Ernest Glenn is Amy's
Dane Cook somewhere.

00:09:02.341 --> 00:09:04.343
(laughs)

00:09:04.343 --> 00:09:09.181
- I mean, no one was more
famous than you in 2008,

00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.685
is that where we're
talking that's right?

00:09:12.685 --> 00:09:14.120
- I think everything
really started yeah,

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.989 align:start size:97% position:3%
five, six, seven, eight,
everything was kind of a blur.

00:09:16.989 --> 00:09:19.125 align:start size:94% position:6%
Even though I remember
all these high water marks

00:09:19.125 --> 00:09:21.227
- I mean, what does
it look like to you

00:09:21.227 --> 00:09:22.762
when you think back
on it like what are,

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:27.099
that must have been, I
mean there's, no one has

00:09:27.099 --> 00:09:29.468
that experience, I can
only name a couple people

00:09:29.468 --> 00:09:30.736
who've had that skyrocketing.

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.538
- There's a lot of columns in,

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:35.474
okay so first of all look
at it mostly as, you know,

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:39.845
this pipe dream came true,
so I was grateful beyond

00:09:39.845 --> 00:09:42.582
because I had a career and
it looked like I'd be able

00:09:42.582 --> 00:09:45.685
to take it as far as I
wanted, willing to work,

00:09:45.685 --> 00:09:47.353 align:start size:84% position:16%
I could take it as
far as I wanted to go.

00:09:47.353 --> 00:09:49.589
So you had all these high
watermark moments of like

00:09:49.589 --> 00:09:52.425
I'm hosting SNL or I'm playing
Madison Square Garden or I'm

00:09:52.425 --> 00:09:54.126 align:start size:84% position:16%
- [Nikki] Rolling
Stones magazine cover.

00:09:54.126 --> 00:09:55.528 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I'm affiliating myself
with, I know Rolling Stones,

00:09:55.528 --> 00:09:57.229
I mean they smashed me
like a year later but

00:09:57.229 --> 00:09:59.799 align:start size:84% position:16%
that was the next
wave of what happens

00:09:59.799 --> 00:10:01.267
- Of course.

00:10:01.267 --> 00:10:03.603 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And I accepted that the
same way I accepted the praise

00:10:03.603 --> 00:10:05.972
cause I knew it was all just
a fucking spanking ultimately

00:10:05.972 --> 00:10:08.107 align:start size:97% position:3%
- The chair was covered right?
- Yeah yeah.

00:10:08.107 --> 00:10:11.143
- Did you know, you knew
the backlash was coming?

00:10:11.143 --> 00:10:12.745
- I think I helped
(laughs) I was like

00:10:12.745 --> 00:10:15.915 align:start size:88% position:13%
I'm gonna tear down too,
I'm ready to devolve

00:10:15.915 --> 00:10:17.383
and then evolve again.

00:10:17.383 --> 00:10:20.453 align:start position:0%
- Because you're right, you
cannot sustain the level of fame

00:10:20.453 --> 00:10:25.458
and adoration and just
wild energy around you

00:10:26.592 --> 00:10:28.127 align:start size:84% position:16%
at that time, that's
not sustainable

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.562
so you knew it was
gonna be taken away?

00:10:29.562 --> 00:10:31.731
- I did and the thing that was,

00:10:31.731 --> 00:10:34.200 align:start size:88% position:13%
not taken away I just
knew that it would crust

00:10:34.200 --> 00:10:35.468
you know what I mean?

00:10:35.468 --> 00:10:36.702
- I guess I look at
it I'm always like

00:10:36.702 --> 00:10:38.638 align:start size:81% position:19%
if I get as famous
as I wanna be,

00:10:38.638 --> 00:10:40.873
it will be taken away,
that's how I look at it.

00:10:40.873 --> 00:10:42.742
- That's, we're in it for
the long haul we're gonna

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:45.077
you know, are you Jerry
Louis, at 90 years old

00:10:45.077 --> 00:10:47.913 align:start size:84% position:16%
I'd see him perform,
at 90 years old

00:10:47.913 --> 00:10:50.483
I went backstage one
time, he would do a Q&amp;A

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:53.219 align:start position:0%
at the very end of a show,
usually lasted about 35 minutes,

00:10:53.219 --> 00:10:55.655
people would line up, ask
questions, it was hilarious

00:10:55.655 --> 00:10:58.457
cause he was salty and
he was honest and so

00:10:58.457 --> 00:10:59.425
- He didn't give a shit.

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:00.626
- He didn't give a shit right?

00:11:00.626 --> 00:11:03.062
But it was awesome, and
so he did not the 35

00:11:03.062 --> 00:11:06.232
he did like 15, and I walked
backstage and he was pissed,

00:11:06.232 --> 00:11:08.034
and nobody was near him
and his daughter was like

00:11:08.034 --> 00:11:09.301
oh Jerry wants to
see you I was like

00:11:09.301 --> 00:11:10.703
I don't even wanna go
near him he looks upset

00:11:10.703 --> 00:11:12.304 align:start size:88% position:13%
she was like no he wants
to talk to a comedian

00:11:12.304 --> 00:11:14.373 align:start size:88% position:13%
he needs to talk to you,
so I walked up there

00:11:14.373 --> 00:11:16.308 align:start size:84% position:16%
and he goes, I
remember 90, he goes

00:11:16.308 --> 00:11:18.344
they fucking let me early.

00:11:18.344 --> 00:11:19.311
(laughs)

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.514
I had another 15 of Q&amp;A.

00:11:21.514 --> 00:11:23.416
At 90 I said, this never ends.

00:11:23.416 --> 00:11:24.583
- [Nikki] Never.

00:11:24.583 --> 00:11:25.518 align:start size:84% position:16%
- We are never
gonna be satisfied.

00:11:25.518 --> 00:11:26.719
- [Nikki] You're right.

00:11:26.719 --> 00:11:27.820
- It's just ever
you know, changing,

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.455
and fans are gonna come and go,

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:31.891
be like uh you're not as
funny as your last thing

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:34.460
and then they come around it's
like being an Aerosmith fan,

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.728 align:start size:84% position:16%
I didn't like that
album but now I'm back

00:11:35.728 --> 00:11:37.930
but now what are you
doing but now I'm back.

00:11:37.930 --> 00:11:40.066
I looked at a career
as like people visit

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:41.767
and they're gonna come
and they're gonna go.

00:11:41.767 --> 00:11:45.237
- But even when you were
at the pinnacle of success

00:11:45.237 --> 00:11:48.207
what does it feel
like you're like

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:50.743 align:start size:88% position:13%
I got everything I could
have ever dreamed of,

00:11:50.743 --> 00:11:52.678
I mean that is wild.

00:11:52.678 --> 00:11:57.149 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah the big up
shock was the level of

00:11:57.149 --> 00:12:00.519 align:start size:97% position:3%
what I could share with
fans and my family you know?

00:12:00.519 --> 00:12:03.289
I was very close to my mom
and my dad and it was like

00:12:03.289 --> 00:12:05.925 align:start size:97% position:3%
everything that I
accomplished and got to show,

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:09.161 align:start size:94% position:6%
especially my mom was
like a mind blowing thing

00:12:09.161 --> 00:12:12.298
cause she knew who
I really was from 14

00:12:12.298 --> 00:12:13.866
and feeling so broken you know?

00:12:13.866 --> 00:12:16.402
Loathing myself at
a very young age,

00:12:16.402 --> 00:12:18.137
now she's watching me on camera

00:12:18.137 --> 00:12:21.507
where I hated who I was
and now she's seeing me

00:12:21.507 --> 00:12:24.877 align:start size:94% position:6%
you know, filming in front
of thousands of people.

00:12:24.877 --> 00:12:28.080 align:start size:81% position:19%
The thing that was
the hardest was

00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:31.917 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
what fame gets you,
superstardom and fame,

00:12:31.917 --> 00:12:33.652
what it really does
when you get there is

00:12:33.652 --> 00:12:36.622
it invites you and
it exposes you to

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:39.759 align:start size:97% position:3%
okay ready welcome now here's
everyone that hates you.

00:12:39.759 --> 00:12:42.027
And your lane's here, and
you gotta remember that,

00:12:42.027 --> 00:12:44.430
and most people drift
off for years to come

00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:46.232 align:start size:84% position:16%
and then you try to
get back to your lane.

00:12:46.232 --> 00:12:50.069 align:start position:0%
The thing that is the most
gratifying is the more you have

00:12:50.069 --> 00:12:52.071
the more you can do
for other people.

00:12:52.071 --> 00:12:53.572
That's the cool thing.

00:12:53.572 --> 00:12:55.875 align:start size:97% position:3%
Whether it's, you know,
going to children hospitals

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:58.778
or, you have so much
more clout to be able

00:12:58.778 --> 00:13:01.413 align:start size:94% position:6%
to shine lights on things
that you want people

00:13:01.413 --> 00:13:04.617 align:start size:84% position:16%
to know or performers
or products,

00:13:04.617 --> 00:13:08.087 align:start size:94% position:6%
so that's the part that
was probably the trickiest

00:13:08.087 --> 00:13:11.023
to have to re jigger you
know, what I'm gonna do.

00:13:11.023 --> 00:13:14.160 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah, what was the
biggest surprise,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:16.996
I'm just fascinated by fame,
and I think it's all some,

00:13:16.996 --> 00:13:19.532 align:start size:88% position:13%
we love doing comedy but
there is a part of us

00:13:19.532 --> 00:13:21.967
that just wants to
be loved by everyone,

00:13:21.967 --> 00:13:24.770
and we want fame,
whatever that is,

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:28.340
what was some things that
you didn't maybe foresee

00:13:28.340 --> 00:13:29.942 align:start size:84% position:16%
when you would
become that famous?

00:13:29.942 --> 00:13:33.112 align:start size:84% position:16%
That became, was
going out in public,

00:13:33.112 --> 00:13:36.916 align:start size:97% position:3%
did you become more
paranoid, wanna stay in more,

00:13:36.916 --> 00:13:38.184
those kinds of things?

00:13:38.184 --> 00:13:40.419
- I was always like home
buddy or where you know,

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:44.056
I built my fanbase
up through MySpace

00:13:44.056 --> 00:13:46.859
and early social networking
because I wasn't a go out

00:13:46.859 --> 00:13:49.995 align:start size:88% position:13%
kind of person you know,
I'm 46 I'm, you know,

00:13:49.995 --> 00:13:51.497
this makes me lame
I never had a drink

00:13:51.497 --> 00:13:53.966
or drug in my whole life,
I didn't do that stuff.

00:13:53.966 --> 00:13:54.834
- You're a cop, I'm out of here.

00:13:54.834 --> 00:13:55.668
- I'm a cop.

00:13:55.668 --> 00:13:57.570
(laughs)

00:13:57.570 --> 00:14:02.474 align:start size:88% position:13%
I just, I loved the
minutia of what it meant

00:14:03.709 --> 00:14:05.377 align:start size:94% position:6%
to have that
correspondence with fans,

00:14:05.377 --> 00:14:07.780 align:start size:84% position:16%
that really was kind
of a kick for me.

00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:10.282
And also you gotta remember,
I could be comfortable at home

00:14:10.282 --> 00:14:12.585
talking to everybody, it
took away that anxiety

00:14:12.585 --> 00:14:16.188
that I felt of off stage
how I deal with people,

00:14:16.188 --> 00:14:18.390 align:start size:94% position:6%
so that, sitting in my
underwear with fruit loops

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:19.959
and like writing
thousands of people

00:14:19.959 --> 00:14:21.894 align:start size:84% position:16%
that was like my
sweet spot I was like,

00:14:21.894 --> 00:14:23.095
this is great, yeah.

00:14:23.095 --> 00:14:24.997
- You touched on some of that,

00:14:24.997 --> 00:14:27.266 align:start size:94% position:6%
I don't think enough
people give you credit for

00:14:27.266 --> 00:14:30.669 align:start size:84% position:16%
and that is literally
creating a world

00:14:30.669 --> 00:14:32.705
where comedians can
promote themselves

00:14:32.705 --> 00:14:35.541
via social media, the
internet, what you did

00:14:35.541 --> 00:14:39.912 align:start position:0%
on MySpace, you know, we talked
about being in the pinnacle

00:14:39.912 --> 00:14:43.282
of fame for you, but
the way you got there,

00:14:43.282 --> 00:14:47.019
the hassle, the fucking,
I respect hassling people

00:14:47.019 --> 00:14:48.454
so much man
- Me too.

00:14:48.454 --> 00:14:52.057 align:start size:97% position:3%
- And so many comics,
you've helped so many comics

00:14:52.057 --> 00:14:55.361
by putting that
process together,

00:14:55.361 --> 00:14:58.430
that template of going
online and hammering,

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.833
like how does MySpace not
sent you a fucking cheque?

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:02.101
(laughs)

00:15:02.101 --> 00:15:04.136
- I gotta say you're
nailing it because I

00:15:04.136 --> 00:15:06.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
- They really did,
but just not directly.

00:15:06.138 --> 00:15:07.439
- Fuck yeah man.

00:15:07.439 --> 00:15:08.874
(laughs)

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:10.476 align:start size:94% position:6%
- I think about Dane
Cook every single weekend

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.578
because I, when I do shows,

00:15:12.578 --> 00:15:14.480
and I do meet and
greets afterwards,

00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.950
I sometimes don't want to, I'm
tired, I don't feel like it,

00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:20.853
I have another show to do,
people are gonna get grabby,

00:15:20.853 --> 00:15:23.589 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's gonna upset me,
but I do it because I go

00:15:23.589 --> 00:15:26.926
that's how Dane, I know that's
how Dane built his audience,

00:15:26.926 --> 00:15:28.794
they have a connection with
them, those people will,

00:15:28.794 --> 00:15:30.529
if they meet me and
have a good moment,

00:15:30.529 --> 00:15:31.964
they will be my fans for life.

00:15:31.964 --> 00:15:33.465
- It's truly true.

00:15:33.465 --> 00:15:36.702
- And I remember you either
reading that you said that

00:15:36.702 --> 00:15:37.937
or, I just know that about you,

00:15:37.937 --> 00:15:39.438
that you would take
the time after shows,

00:15:39.438 --> 00:15:40.506
spend hours meeting fans.

00:15:40.506 --> 00:15:42.107
- Longer than the shows.

00:15:42.107 --> 00:15:45.878
- I mean how, do
you still do that?

00:15:45.878 --> 00:15:48.280 align:start size:97% position:3%
I mean you, that can't be
sustainable at your level now.

00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:50.582 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yeah I mean, I still
do meet and greets,

00:15:50.582 --> 00:15:52.084
you know with a tour
like this it's hard

00:15:52.084 --> 00:15:54.620
cause we're moving to the
next thing like that night.

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.322
But if people are
waiting outside

00:15:56.322 --> 00:15:58.958 align:start size:97% position:3%
or at the bus it's like,
I'm gonna be there you know,

00:15:58.958 --> 00:16:01.193
I wanna make sure I
can still, you know,

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:02.895
hang with whoever
wants to meet me,

00:16:02.895 --> 00:16:04.363 align:start size:88% position:13%
it's still
- It's really inspiring.

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:05.898 align:start size:94% position:6%
- It's really gratifying,
you know what I mean?

00:16:05.898 --> 00:16:07.633
It's like people want to,
you know, 29 years later,

00:16:07.633 --> 00:16:10.302 align:start size:94% position:6%
it's like people are as
excited to come to a show.

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:13.238 align:start size:94% position:6%
And the thing that was
cool about when I hear it,

00:16:13.238 --> 00:16:15.908
when people say back to me
like this is what you did,

00:16:15.908 --> 00:16:18.277
that was also at a
time where it just,

00:16:18.277 --> 00:16:21.180 align:start size:84% position:16%
the old era of comedy
at that point was

00:16:21.180 --> 00:16:22.648
you didn't do that stuff.

00:16:23.816 --> 00:16:25.517
- You posted flyers
on windshields, parks

00:16:25.517 --> 00:16:28.587
- I was, I was barking, I
was like doing everything,

00:16:28.587 --> 00:16:30.789
but that was like not
in vogue at the time,

00:16:31.824 --> 00:16:33.592
and I got a lot of crap for it,

00:16:33.592 --> 00:16:36.628
but it just felt like, I felt
like I was doing something

00:16:36.628 --> 00:16:38.364 align:start size:84% position:16%
in the never been
done before business.

00:16:38.364 --> 00:16:39.832
- Right.

00:16:39.832 --> 00:16:41.834 align:start size:97% position:3%
- So I wasn't following
anybody else's lead in that.

00:16:41.834 --> 00:16:43.202
- You were leading the way.

00:16:43.202 --> 00:16:44.703
- So I was like if
I fuck up it's okay

00:16:44.703 --> 00:16:46.805
because nobody knows what's
right and wrong with this.

00:16:46.805 --> 00:16:48.674 align:start size:94% position:6%
- You're that dude, you're
the dude with a machete

00:16:48.674 --> 00:16:50.576
just chopping shit
going follow me guys.

00:16:50.576 --> 00:16:51.877
- And I literally
held the machete

00:16:51.877 --> 00:16:53.512 align:start size:94% position:6%
how do you know all this?
- I know.

00:16:53.512 --> 00:16:54.346
(laughs)

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.714
- I'm just sitting at

00:16:55.714 --> 00:16:56.815 align:start size:94% position:6%
my dull computer
- While you're on MySpace.

00:16:56.815 --> 00:16:59.018
(laughs)

00:16:59.018 --> 00:17:01.787
Yeah because it is, comedians
they wanna roll their eyes

00:17:01.787 --> 00:17:03.555
at any kind of self promotion,

00:17:03.555 --> 00:17:05.691 align:start size:84% position:16%
you're just supposed
to hate yourself,

00:17:06.825 --> 00:17:07.960 align:start size:84% position:16%
and you're just
supposed to, that's

00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:09.395 align:start size:88% position:13%
what a comic is supposed
to be just very,

00:17:09.395 --> 00:17:12.197 align:start size:94% position:6%
just stick to the course,
do your set, leave,

00:17:12.197 --> 00:17:14.833
if you win against anything
- it's not the world anymore.

00:17:14.833 --> 00:17:18.704
- It wasn't cool
to promote yourself

00:17:18.704 --> 00:17:23.575 align:start size:97% position:3%
and you didn't care and
listen you, now we all do it.

00:17:23.575 --> 00:17:26.245 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I didn't care
because it was like

00:17:26.245 --> 00:17:28.781
oh wow, I get to
have a great life,

00:17:28.781 --> 00:17:31.150
I get to have a couple
cool things if I need it,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:32.384
get to take care of my family,

00:17:32.384 --> 00:17:35.320
bought my mom a house
when I was 29 years old

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:36.722
(laughs)

00:17:36.722 --> 00:17:39.124 align:start size:97% position:3%
you know, it's like, a
welfare kid from Massachusets

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.626
and I get to buy my mom a house.

00:17:40.626 --> 00:17:42.094
- [Nikki] It's so cool.

00:17:42.094 --> 00:17:43.462 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Everything that
people wanna say like,

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:46.865
but wasn't it, you know,
wasn't it so difficult

00:17:46.865 --> 00:17:49.001 align:start size:97% position:3%
to have A, B and C yeah, there
were definitely hardships,

00:17:49.001 --> 00:17:51.804 align:start size:94% position:6%
tough times, but every
day I could wake up and go

00:17:51.804 --> 00:17:54.840 align:start size:94% position:6%
there's a stage somewhere
I can get on tonight,

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:56.542
and I know I can get
laughs, and at the end

00:17:56.542 --> 00:17:58.644 align:start size:84% position:16%
of like whatever
this long career is,

00:17:58.644 --> 00:18:02.347
I hope I'm 90 complaining
backstage like my mentor.

00:18:02.347 --> 00:18:04.783
But I look at it and
go, to be able to,

00:18:04.783 --> 00:18:07.519
night after night, get on
stage and try to figure out

00:18:07.519 --> 00:18:09.154 align:start size:88% position:13%
something that connects
with the crowd,

00:18:09.154 --> 00:18:12.024
that is the challenge
that never gets boring

00:18:12.024 --> 00:18:13.892
or lessen you know.

00:18:13.892 --> 00:18:16.462 align:start position:0%
- That's, yeah, because there's,
you always have to write,

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:18.330 align:start size:88% position:13%
you always have to
come up with new stuff,

00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.999 align:start size:84% position:16%
it never gets boring
you're so right.

00:18:20.999 --> 00:18:25.471
Tickets for his tour Tell it
like it is are on sale now.

00:18:25.471 --> 00:18:27.005
Tell it like it is
what are we gonna,

00:18:27.005 --> 00:18:28.607
what are you talking
about on this tour,

00:18:28.607 --> 00:18:30.275
what's the title come from?

00:18:30.275 --> 00:18:34.046
- A lot of the title
is, I wanted to get

00:18:34.046 --> 00:18:35.347
to a point in my stand up

00:18:35.347 --> 00:18:39.017 align:start size:88% position:13%
where I could use every
tool in the arsenal

00:18:39.017 --> 00:18:41.487 align:start size:84% position:16%
in terms of like, I
still love physicality

00:18:41.487 --> 00:18:43.422 align:start size:81% position:19%
but I'm 46 I'm not
gonna drop kick

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:46.291
and do, you know,
on the mic stand

00:18:46.291 --> 00:18:47.860
or whatever I was doing before,

00:18:47.860 --> 00:18:50.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
but I still have
that same, you know,

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:53.632
enthusiasm, that's just,
that's organic you know?

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.767
It's like when you see
Chris Rock practicing

00:18:55.767 --> 00:18:58.270
he's lowkey, and then
you see him on a show

00:18:58.270 --> 00:18:59.771
and it just, you know, you know,

00:18:59.771 --> 00:19:01.507
you get in show mode
and you get up there

00:19:01.507 --> 00:19:04.910 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it all kind of you know,
comes into the character.

00:19:04.910 --> 00:19:07.179
But I didn't ever
want the character

00:19:07.179 --> 00:19:09.648
to be somebody whom when I
saw you on the meet and greet

00:19:09.648 --> 00:19:12.384
felt like it was so different
or a put on from the show,

00:19:12.384 --> 00:19:14.520 align:start size:97% position:3%
I want to be able to pretty
much keep the demeanor

00:19:14.520 --> 00:19:17.222
and walk up and meet you
and know I can say to you

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.657
I have two minutes, dude come on

00:19:18.657 --> 00:19:20.826 align:start size:97% position:3%
let's fucking take the
picture and get out of here.

00:19:20.826 --> 00:19:22.861
And it's okay, cause
you know who I am,

00:19:22.861 --> 00:19:25.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
you know what I'm about,
with the routine now

00:19:25.464 --> 00:19:27.966
and why I brought
Gary Shamley up was

00:19:27.966 --> 00:19:30.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
I just love the idea that
you could get introspective.

00:19:30.569 --> 00:19:33.539
And I didn't, I had a lot of
observation for many years,

00:19:33.539 --> 00:19:36.775 align:start size:97% position:3%
but I wanted the introspection
so desperately, so

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:37.609
- It's scary to do that.

00:19:37.609 --> 00:19:38.544
- It's scary.

00:19:38.544 --> 00:19:39.745
- You dig up a lot of shit.

00:19:39.745 --> 00:19:42.080 align:start size:88% position:13%
- You're digging up
stuff but, with insight,

00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:43.515
some of these things
that happened to me

00:19:43.515 --> 00:19:46.885
that have been in
the moment like so,

00:19:46.885 --> 00:19:50.522
just, you know, almost cap
sizing moments of my life,

00:19:50.522 --> 00:19:52.724
are hilarious, now
that I'm sharing them

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.293
and telling the stories.

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:55.827 align:start size:88% position:13% line:0%
But why it took a
little longer to key was

00:19:55.827 --> 00:19:57.629 line:0%
I didn't want to be modeling.

00:19:57.629 --> 00:20:00.299 line:0%
I didn't wanna be like, hey
this is more one man show

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:03.602 align:start size:88% position:13%
because it's introspect,
no no no, I want LPM,

00:20:03.602 --> 00:20:05.370
laughs permitted, the same thing

00:20:05.370 --> 00:20:07.606
that you saw on Vicious
Circle or Retaliation,

00:20:07.606 --> 00:20:10.275
but with things that are
even more deeply personal.

00:20:10.275 --> 00:20:12.978
So now that I've got that,
we're doing every damn city

00:20:12.978 --> 00:20:14.613
in the entire country.

00:20:14.613 --> 00:20:16.515 align:start size:97% position:3%
- [Nikki] I'm so excited how
long are you on tour for?

00:20:17.449 --> 00:20:18.917
A while.

00:20:18.917 --> 00:20:19.985 align:start size:97% position:3%
- At least until September
and then we're already looking

00:20:19.985 --> 00:20:21.687
at like the future of it all and

00:20:21.687 --> 00:20:24.056 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Yes I'm so excited
- Oh thank you.

00:20:24.056 --> 00:20:25.557
- To see your new act,
I've always been a fan

00:20:25.557 --> 00:20:28.794 align:start size:81% position:19%
and I haven't seen
you for so long

00:20:28.794 --> 00:20:32.864
I'm excited cause you did
go through some shit man.

00:20:32.864 --> 00:20:34.333
- Yeah.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:36.468 align:start size:97% position:3%
- I mean, and you have gotten
into some serious stuff

00:20:36.468 --> 00:20:38.437
in your past stand
up, did you feel

00:20:38.437 --> 00:20:41.673
like you were modeling
then, with that stuff?

00:20:41.673 --> 00:20:44.042
Are you approaching
it different, or?

00:20:44.042 --> 00:20:46.612 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Yeah I think with what
you're speaking of was like,

00:20:46.612 --> 00:20:49.548 align:start size:94% position:6%
when I did Isolated
Incidents, that came after

00:20:49.548 --> 00:20:51.950
you know my mom and dad
had passed away, cancer,

00:20:51.950 --> 00:20:54.419
same year, nine months,
both of my best friends

00:20:54.419 --> 00:20:56.688
just like gone, and then
I went through the stuff

00:20:56.688 --> 00:20:58.490
with my brother and this
whole financial thing,

00:20:58.490 --> 00:21:00.859 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then I went through
the stuff with CK,

00:21:00.859 --> 00:21:03.862
and it was like within
a three year period,

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:06.598
all these, you know pressurized,

00:21:06.598 --> 00:21:08.900 align:start size:94% position:6%
highly pressurized moments
were happening to me.

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:12.004
So that was reflected
in Isolated Incidents

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:13.305
and I called it that
because I felt like

00:21:13.305 --> 00:21:14.906 align:start size:81% position:19%
how I felt in that
time in my life

00:21:14.906 --> 00:21:16.808
was going to be an
isolated incident,

00:21:16.808 --> 00:21:18.844
I knew I'd get past
it and get to like

00:21:18.844 --> 00:21:22.014
whatever I felt before, a
new normal kind of thing,

00:21:22.014 --> 00:21:24.082
to quote Oprah, a new normal.

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:26.051
And so I don't look
at it as modeling

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.686
but I just look at
that particular,

00:21:27.686 --> 00:21:31.356
I'm very fond of that show,
Mardy Colner directed it,

00:21:31.356 --> 00:21:33.058 align:start size:84% position:16%
he directed Vicious
Circle as well

00:21:33.058 --> 00:21:34.393
- It's intimate, it
was just a departure

00:21:34.393 --> 00:21:36.028
from what we had seen from you.

00:21:36.028 --> 00:21:38.897
- The challenge that
year, I always have

00:21:38.897 --> 00:21:40.699
kind of a new year
challenge for myself,

00:21:40.699 --> 00:21:42.968 align:start size:84% position:16%
and wanted to had
something to you know,

00:21:42.968 --> 00:21:46.138 align:start size:84% position:16%
extend the abilities
or opportunities

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:48.707 align:start size:84% position:16%
to tell different
kinds of stories was,

00:21:48.707 --> 00:21:50.876
the whole year I
planted my feet,

00:21:50.876 --> 00:21:53.278
I kept the mic in the mic
stand and never moved.

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:55.247 align:start size:84% position:16%
For one year,
January fucking first

00:21:55.247 --> 00:21:57.883
to the end of the year,
I did not move on stage.

00:21:57.883 --> 00:21:59.818 align:start size:97% position:3%
And so when I did that show
- Wow.

00:21:59.818 --> 00:22:03.755 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It was to prepare me from
being all the animation

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:07.092
to can I tell a whole
show with just my eyes.

00:22:07.092 --> 00:22:07.926
- [Nikki] Wow.

00:22:07.926 --> 00:22:09.428
- That's crazy.

00:22:09.428 --> 00:22:10.629
There's so many comics I know
that are just the opposite,

00:22:10.629 --> 00:22:12.197 align:start size:88% position:13%
they're like I'm on
stage, I'm just standing

00:22:12.197 --> 00:22:14.933 align:start size:84% position:16%
in one spot, I
should move around to

00:22:14.933 --> 00:22:17.569 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Well you know but, that
makes sense that you did that

00:22:17.569 --> 00:22:20.806
because, you know, people
were so jealous of you,

00:22:20.806 --> 00:22:23.875 align:start size:97% position:3%
and so angry at your success,
that you became someone

00:22:23.875 --> 00:22:27.479
that people would,
the pacing the stage,

00:22:27.479 --> 00:22:30.615
the things that we all
fucking loved about you

00:22:30.615 --> 00:22:33.719 align:start size:97% position:3%
and made you so funny,
that was then being mocked.

00:22:33.719 --> 00:22:35.387
- Yeah Family Guy and
all that kind of stuff

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:37.322
- Of course, everywhere, I mean

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:40.359
you were so fucking huge dude.

00:22:40.359 --> 00:22:42.694
And people wanted
to make fun of it

00:22:42.694 --> 00:22:44.863
even though it was
what got you there

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.398
and what we all loved.

00:22:46.398 --> 00:22:48.333
So it makes sense that you
were like, you know what?

00:22:48.333 --> 00:22:50.268 align:start size:84% position:16%
I can still do this
without all that shit,

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:51.803
and I'll prove it to you.

00:22:51.803 --> 00:22:53.472
And that's really cool that you,

00:22:53.472 --> 00:22:54.706 align:start size:84% position:16%
what was your
challenge this year?

00:22:54.706 --> 00:22:56.908 align:start size:84% position:16%
I mean every year
you have a new thing?

00:22:56.908 --> 00:22:59.811
- Not so much this
year but about two,

00:22:59.811 --> 00:23:01.413 align:start size:94% position:6%
after I did Troublemaker,
Troublemaker was

00:23:01.413 --> 00:23:04.616 align:start size:88% position:13%
the last special on show
time that I directed,

00:23:04.616 --> 00:23:05.984
my first time directing

00:23:05.984 --> 00:23:07.219
- What was that like?

00:23:07.219 --> 00:23:08.854 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Amazing, because for
the first time ever

00:23:08.854 --> 00:23:11.056 align:start size:84% position:16%
you know as a
comedian we finish it

00:23:11.056 --> 00:23:12.691 align:start size:88% position:13%
and then sometimes other
people are impending

00:23:12.691 --> 00:23:15.560 align:start size:94% position:6%
on the process and, maybe
an edit is weird or,

00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.362 align:start size:84% position:16%
there's always a
little something inky.

00:23:17.362 --> 00:23:19.598 align:start size:94% position:6%
I wanted to have something
that from start to end

00:23:19.598 --> 00:23:21.099
I could create and say you know,

00:23:21.099 --> 00:23:24.035 align:start size:94% position:6%
this is entirely how I saw
it and wanted it to be,

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:25.337
the exact, the whole show.

00:23:26.471 --> 00:23:28.507
And so from that I
really, I loved that,

00:23:28.507 --> 00:23:30.642
I loved that feeling of freedom,

00:23:30.642 --> 00:23:34.679 align:start position:0%
and I liked that I could, I
can say no to a bunch of stuff,

00:23:34.679 --> 00:23:36.748 align:start size:97% position:3%
because of the opportunities
comedy has given me,

00:23:36.748 --> 00:23:39.518 align:start size:94% position:6%
and I can say yes to
like one particular thing

00:23:39.518 --> 00:23:41.787
that I'm trying to accomplish.

00:23:41.787 --> 00:23:45.357
So the last three years have
really been about this material

00:23:45.357 --> 00:23:46.925
it just took a little bit longer

00:23:46.925 --> 00:23:48.927
because like I said I wanted to,

00:23:48.927 --> 00:23:52.431 align:start size:97% position:3%
I wanted to dig into the
real nitty gritty of it all.

00:23:52.431 --> 00:23:55.600
- I'm so excited because
when you came on the scene

00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.235
with your comedy
central presence

00:23:57.235 --> 00:23:58.470
which was just

00:23:58.470 --> 00:23:59.971
- O one, yeah 2001.

00:23:59.971 --> 00:24:03.975 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Dude, I mean, that's,
wasn't that the first thing

00:24:03.975 --> 00:24:06.445 align:start size:88% position:13%
that people just go
what the, like this guy?

00:24:06.445 --> 00:24:07.846
- Yeah, oh and me too
I was like oh my god

00:24:07.846 --> 00:24:08.980
what the fuck, this is working.

00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.582
- That was crazy.

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:13.018
- Yeah before that it was
a lot of years of you know.

00:24:13.018 --> 00:24:13.985
- I mean, but that was

00:24:13.985 --> 00:24:15.754
- A different what the fuck.

00:24:15.754 --> 00:24:18.523 align:start size:97% position:3%
- That was what your debut,
and you had worked so,

00:24:18.523 --> 00:24:20.192
you'd been working so many years

00:24:20.192 --> 00:24:23.195 align:start size:94% position:6%
to have that kind of
splash and now I'm excited

00:24:23.195 --> 00:24:24.729
to see all the work
that you've again

00:24:24.729 --> 00:24:27.999
kind of put into this, to
make a new kind of splash.

00:24:27.999 --> 00:24:32.337
Like it's exciting, and
I'm just such a fan,

00:24:32.337 --> 00:24:34.105 align:start size:84% position:16%
and I really am
grateful as a comedian

00:24:34.105 --> 00:24:35.941
for what you've done for us.

00:24:35.941 --> 00:24:37.375 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Oh thank you, that means
a lot to me thank you.

00:24:37.375 --> 00:24:41.313 align:start size:97% position:3%
- It's true dude, like I
remember getting into stand up

00:24:41.313 --> 00:24:43.281 align:start size:88% position:13%
when I first started
thinking about doing it,

00:24:43.281 --> 00:24:45.917 align:start size:94% position:6%
listening to Harmful
Sword and I still remember

00:24:45.917 --> 00:24:48.520
the stoplight I was
at in Lawrence Kansas

00:24:48.520 --> 00:24:50.856
when I was laughing
out loud so hard

00:24:50.856 --> 00:24:54.292
in a way that I had never
laughed out loud that hard.

00:24:54.292 --> 00:24:57.829 align:start position:0%
And I was like there's something
so special about this guy,

00:24:57.829 --> 00:24:59.464 align:start size:88% position:13%
I was a huge fan I came
to see you in Vegas

00:24:59.464 --> 00:25:02.868
when you did the Insomniac tour.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:04.069
- Yeah yeah.

00:25:04.069 --> 00:25:06.204 align:start size:88% position:13%
- I flew with my friends
there to go see you

00:25:06.204 --> 00:25:07.706
- Oh that was a great show.
- Cause I was such a fan.

00:25:07.706 --> 00:25:09.508
I got picked to be seat filler,

00:25:09.508 --> 00:25:12.377 align:start size:97% position:3%
cause I had a regular seat
but we were like two hot girls

00:25:12.377 --> 00:25:14.679 align:start size:84% position:16%
so they asked us to
sit in the second row,

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:17.315
then I got to go to the
VIP party afterwards

00:25:17.315 --> 00:25:18.984 align:start size:97% position:3%
because we were seat
fillers, and they didn't know

00:25:18.984 --> 00:25:21.086 align:start size:97% position:3%
I was a comedian, I just
started a couple months ago,

00:25:21.086 --> 00:25:23.221
I told my friends I go,
you do not tell anyone

00:25:23.221 --> 00:25:25.090
I'm doing stand up,
that is humiliating,

00:25:25.090 --> 00:25:26.825 align:start size:84% position:16%
these guys are pros,
don't mention it.

00:25:26.825 --> 00:25:29.194
And she drunkenly went
up to you and was like

00:25:29.194 --> 00:25:31.763 align:start size:84% position:16%
my friend just started
comedy and I go no,

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:36.768
and you were so, so cool, you
didn't need to do this at all

00:25:38.169 --> 00:25:39.571 align:start size:84% position:16% line:0%
and it was the
last thing I wanted

00:25:39.571 --> 00:25:42.073 line:0%
was to bother you after
the show in this taping

00:25:42.073 --> 00:25:44.142
but you go come here,
I have some advice.

00:25:44.142 --> 00:25:46.244
You took me in the corner
and you just hounded on me

00:25:46.244 --> 00:25:48.179 align:start size:94% position:6%
and you go, here's the
deal, don't go to New York

00:25:48.179 --> 00:25:50.649
or LA, it's too soon
for you, go to Boston,

00:25:50.649 --> 00:25:52.751 align:start size:94% position:6%
go to Chicago, go to
Denver, go somewhere else,

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:55.654
work out, you just gave me
this TED talk that was like

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:56.955
(laughs)

00:25:56.955 --> 00:25:58.223
that just to the point

00:25:58.223 --> 00:25:59.291 align:start size:88% position:13%
- This is so me
- Exactly what I needed

00:25:59.291 --> 00:26:00.692 align:start size:88% position:13%
to hear
- This is what happens.

00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:01.927
- There was no other
bullshit involved,

00:26:01.927 --> 00:26:03.895
you were so nice,
and it was just,

I just like stood
there, took it all in,

and like did that,
I followed it,

00:26:08.767 --> 00:26:10.302
and it was great advice,
the same kind of advice

00:26:10.302 --> 00:26:13.838
I give to people, but the
fact that you took the time

00:26:13.838 --> 00:26:16.308 align:start size:97% position:3%
to do that in that night
really meant something to me,

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:18.410 align:start size:97% position:3%
and it speaks to your
character and I appreciate it.

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.644 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Oh wow.

so animated off stage.

didn't he hit on me?

00:26:22.747 --> 00:26:25.150 align:start size:84% position:16%
- I was a little
offended I gotta say

00:26:25.150 --> 00:26:26.585
but you were all

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:31.189
I think everyone drank
and stayed up too late

00:26:31.189 --> 00:26:32.958
and you were, you
were professional,

00:26:32.958 --> 00:26:34.492

to do and I was like

00:26:34.492 --> 00:26:37.395
oh he's just going home,
like you're an introvert.

00:26:37.395 --> 00:26:38.630
- That was it, yeah.

00:26:38.630 --> 00:26:40.332
I mean honestly,
even to this day,

00:26:40.332 --> 00:26:42.133
you know when I do
the meet and greet,

00:26:42.133 --> 00:26:45.003 align:start size:97% position:3%

you know it's just

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:47.305
