00:00:00.370 --> 00:00:03.360
So we tell you that persona is really important in designing applications. So

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:07.100
let's now talk about the mobile persona. Now, when you think about your

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.090
applications persona, no matter how different they are. No matter what they are

00:00:11.090 --> 00:00:13.670
exactly they have to inherit from this

00:00:13.670 --> 00:00:16.770
superclass which is the mobile user persona.

00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.280
&gt;&gt; So that means that you need to take the attributes of the mobile user persona

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:22.230
into account as well as the attributes of

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.520
your apps persona. So Izabel, what are the attributes

00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:27.110
of this mobile user persona?

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:29.290
&gt;&gt; Well, the first attribute would be that they have

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:32.710
a finite data plan and finite amount of battery they also

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:35.760
have divided attention. Yeah, exactly when I'm using my phone I'm

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:38.120
always doing like five or six things at the same time.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.360
&gt;&gt; There's also something called handedness, which has to do

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:42.149
with how the user holds the phone in their hands.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:46.730
&gt;&gt; And then, of course the mobile user has a very small screen.

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.190
&gt;&gt; And also, because the user's moving

00:00:48.190 --> 00:00:50.330
around, they usually have very sketchy network

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:52.890
access. Yeah. This is a really important one and we

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.930
will dive into this much more deeply in lesson four.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:58.350
&gt;&gt; I think it's really interesting that with these

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.170
mobile persona attributes that some of them are actually

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:03.130
a result of the form factor of the phone,

00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.590
like having a small screen. Yeah. Yeah, others are

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:08.960
actually a result of human form factors our hands

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.000
only move in certain ways. Our brains actually work

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.090
in certain ways which is why we have divided

00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:15.530
attention when were moving around doing six things at once.

00:01:15.530 --> 00:01:17.240
&gt;&gt; And also some of them have to do with what it

00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.910
means to be mobile like when your interacting within a physical environment.

00:01:20.910 --> 00:01:24.980
&gt;&gt; You have things like your network can be sketchy because if you go

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:26.260
inside of a building or inside of

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:28.275
an elevator and things like that. Yeah, exactly.

00:01:28.275 --> 00:01:30.566
&gt;&gt; So, I think that these attributes are

00:01:30.566 --> 00:01:33.870
so important and they're so concrete that they're-

00:01:33.870 --> 00:01:35.385
&gt;&gt; we think of them more as constraints

00:01:35.385 --> 00:01:37.655
and not just attributes, meaning you can't violate

00:01:37.655 --> 00:01:40.930
them at all or your users is going to have a really bad time. Yeah that's

00:01:40.930 --> 00:01:43.340
true and don't think that because we're using the word

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.920
"constraint" that you're limited in some way. Innovation is spurred

00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.260
as a result of constraints. So it's our challenge to

00:01:50.260 --> 00:01:52.250
actually leverage these constraints and

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.700
create really compelling experiences given that

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:58.260
this users going to have finite data and battery divided attention

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:01.190
and all those other limitations. And we should also, since

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:03.250
we're in the subject of constraints let's not forget about

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.165
the power that you have on mobile. You can create amazing

00:02:06.165 --> 00:02:08.500
real-time location based experiences that are

00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:10.091
simply not possible on web and desktop.
