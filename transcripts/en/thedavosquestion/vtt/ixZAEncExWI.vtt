00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.809
&gt;&gt; The big question that I think needs to
be answered is how can we

00:00:07.809 --> 00:00:14.070
provide entrepreneurial education to poorest
of the poor.

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:19.429
Access to education as we know it is no longer
sufficient or valid,

00:00:19.429 --> 00:00:25.019
only access to education but education that
has no quality does not

00:00:25.019 --> 00:00:29.970
produce any tangible results.
Many of the world's poor have access to education

00:00:29.970 --> 00:00:33.930
and in fact have been
to third, sixth, ninth grade.

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:37.430
That has not changed anything so what they
need is practical

00:00:37.430 --> 00:00:46.870
entrepreneurial education to everybody.
In order to to provide this education that

00:00:46.870 --> 00:00:52.010
I think that education
should pay for itself or could pay for itself

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:59.470
by income-generating
educational programs on campus with the teachers

00:00:59.470 --> 00:01:03.350
and with the students.
But we think that if we do not do something

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:08.760
with quality of education
right now, we will not be able to overcome

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:10.780
the challenges that we're
facing right now.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.619
Thank you very much.
