00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:26.560
force and we can't do it for them so we
 

00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.620
force and we can't do it for them so we
do the odd predator attack which to some

00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:37.590
we can build up relevant Pakistani
capabilities because most of their

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:37.600
