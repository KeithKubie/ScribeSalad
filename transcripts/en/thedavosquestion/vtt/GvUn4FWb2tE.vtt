00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.949
&gt;&gt; Hey, YouTube. My name is Bruce Sewell.
I'm senior vice president and general counsel

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:08.990
of Intel Corporation. And I wanted to answer
the question about whether President Obama

00:00:08.990 --> 00:00:14.130
is likely to improve the state of the world
in 2009. Quite simply I think, the answer

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:19.250
to that is yes. But you need to be a bit careful
with the metrics by which you are going to

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:27.110
measure success. If we set the bar at stemming
the rising tide of unemployment or putting

00:00:27.110 --> 00:00:32.410
liquidity back into the banking system, then
I think it's still far too early to say with

00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:39.860
any certainty that we are going to see those
kinds of events in 2009. On the other hand,

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.530
if you measure this or you define success,
as improving the relationship between the

00:00:47.530 --> 00:00:54.390
American government and the rest of the world,
or even more specifically improving the relationship

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:59.750
between the American government and its own
citizens. Then I think the answer is a bit

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:05.300
more easy, and perhaps even self evident.
I'm optimistic that we are going to sow the

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:11.700
seeds for improvement in 2009, but I'm less
sure that the world will be in a position

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.140
to reap that harvest within just the next
12 or 18 months.
