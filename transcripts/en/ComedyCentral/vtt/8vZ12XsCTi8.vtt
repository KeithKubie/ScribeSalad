00:00:59.058 --> 00:01:01.161
- I was, uh, working
most of my gigs

00:01:01.161 --> 00:01:04.063
for the Funny Bone Comedy Club
out of St. Louis.

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.565
They own 21 comedy clubs.

00:01:05.565 --> 00:01:09.435
And I was a prominent
headliner for them in 1996

00:01:09.435 --> 00:01:12.471
and, uh, making about
2 grand a week.

00:01:12.471 --> 00:01:14.506
They would fly me to the gigs.

00:01:14.506 --> 00:01:16.409
And I wasn't paying my taxes,

00:01:16.409 --> 00:01:19.411
so it even felt like I was
making more money than I was...

00:01:19.411 --> 00:01:23.449
and, uh, living pretty
fucking good, and...

00:01:23.449 --> 00:01:27.820
And, uh, so the guy
that owned that chain of clubs

00:01:27.820 --> 00:01:31.256
realized that I was working
42 weeks a year for him,

00:01:31.256 --> 00:01:33.760
so he didn't have to
pay me that much money.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.795
Because what the fuck else
would I do, you know?

00:01:35.795 --> 00:01:38.264
Where am I gonna go
get those kinda gigs, you know?

00:01:38.264 --> 00:01:39.665
I just--I don't know.

00:01:39.665 --> 00:01:43.803
And so he cuts my pay
from 2 grand and air

00:01:43.803 --> 00:01:47.639
to 1,500...flat, and, uh...

00:01:47.639 --> 00:01:52.445
I told him to go eat
a steamin' bowl of fuck.

00:01:52.445 --> 00:01:55.047
Okay, cut to years later.

00:01:55.047 --> 00:01:56.949
Blue Collar Comedy Tour
happens.

00:01:56.949 --> 00:01:58.684
We sell 10 million albums.

00:01:58.684 --> 00:02:02.622
I start touring.
I play Radio City Music Hall.

00:02:02.622 --> 00:02:04.791
You know, just things
I never even dreamed of.

00:02:04.791 --> 00:02:07.293
I'm from a little dirt town
in Northwest Texas.

00:02:07.293 --> 00:02:09.662
And, uh, I'm on my tour bus.

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:12.699
It's late at night,
and I'm driving back to Atlanta.

00:02:12.699 --> 00:02:14.867
And Wednesday night
when I get back to Atlanta,

00:02:14.867 --> 00:02:16.869
where I have a house,

00:02:16.869 --> 00:02:20.406
I'm gonna be the auctioneer
at this huge charity event,

00:02:20.406 --> 00:02:23.642
in a tuxedo,
called the East Lake Foundation,

00:02:23.642 --> 00:02:25.511
and it's part of the end
of the golf season

00:02:25.511 --> 00:02:27.580
with the East Lake course.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:29.381
So that's my big charity
of the year,

00:02:29.381 --> 00:02:31.483
so it's a big deal,
and I do it every year.

00:02:31.483 --> 00:02:34.253
And I'm real fucking drunk
in my bus, which happens--

00:02:34.253 --> 00:02:36.990
we get what we call
bus fucked up in that bus

00:02:36.990 --> 00:02:39.325
where your only goal

00:02:39.325 --> 00:02:41.260
is to stay sober enough
to make it

00:02:41.260 --> 00:02:43.863
to where your fuckin' bunk
is and, uh...

00:02:43.863 --> 00:02:45.331
and I've barely done it.

00:02:45.331 --> 00:02:46.699
And underneath
my bed on the bunk,

00:02:46.699 --> 00:02:48.267
there's a drawer
that's refrigerated,

00:02:48.267 --> 00:02:49.835
and I can get water.

00:02:49.835 --> 00:02:52.505
And I've just had
a bunch of dental work done,

00:02:52.505 --> 00:02:55.541
and all these are crowns
on the front of my teeth,

00:02:55.541 --> 00:02:58.577
and, uh, so--
and one of 'em had been loose,

00:02:58.577 --> 00:03:01.214
and it had fallen off,
and it was this one right here,

00:03:01.214 --> 00:03:02.949
that bad boy right there.

00:03:02.949 --> 00:03:06.585
And I stuck it back on with a
piece of toilet paper in there,

00:03:06.585 --> 00:03:08.554
and it had been on there
for quite a while.

00:03:08.554 --> 00:03:10.356
It stuck on,
and it looked great.

00:03:10.356 --> 00:03:11.891
Look, my teeth look great.
None of them are real.

00:03:11.891 --> 00:03:14.093
None of this shit's real.
None of it.

00:03:14.093 --> 00:03:15.861
Not one fucking
thing in this is real.

00:03:15.861 --> 00:03:19.064
And, uh, so I'm gulping
down this water

00:03:19.064 --> 00:03:21.534
drunk on my bus late at night,

00:03:21.534 --> 00:03:24.436
and the tooth comes off,
and I swallow it.

00:03:24.436 --> 00:03:28.207
And, uh, and I understand
the ramifications of this

00:03:28.207 --> 00:03:30.909
the second that it happens
because

00:03:30.909 --> 00:03:32.445
we live here, too,

00:03:32.445 --> 00:03:34.313
and the dentist that did it's
in Beverly Hills.

00:03:34.313 --> 00:03:37.883
That took cost 2,000
fuckin' dollars.

00:03:37.883 --> 00:03:42.488
And I need it
for Wednesday night...

00:03:42.488 --> 00:03:47.293
and I know where it is.

00:03:47.293 --> 00:03:49.461
So I go onto the internet:

00:03:49.461 --> 00:03:54.333
"What do you do
if you swallow a tooth?"

00:03:54.333 --> 00:03:57.736
Well, it says take laxatives--

00:03:57.736 --> 00:04:00.806
which I figured
that was part of it--

00:04:00.806 --> 00:04:03.409
and shit in a trash can

00:04:03.409 --> 00:04:05.745
and then mull around
in the trash can...

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:09.014
- Oh!
- Until you find your tooth.

00:04:09.014 --> 00:04:12.785
Now, I literally have a tenth
grade high school education.

00:04:12.785 --> 00:04:15.320
I didn't graduate from high
school, didn't go to college,

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:16.822
didn't do any of those things.

00:04:16.822 --> 00:04:19.992
And, uh--but still...

00:04:19.992 --> 00:04:23.963
I thought, "Strainer."

00:04:23.963 --> 00:04:29.202
[laughter]

00:04:29.202 --> 00:04:32.271
Shit in a strainer.

00:04:32.271 --> 00:04:33.839
Take the strainer
over to the sink,

00:04:33.839 --> 00:04:35.875
and like you're pannin'
for fucking gold.

00:04:35.875 --> 00:04:38.878
Just run water...
over the turd

00:04:38.878 --> 00:04:41.880
and let it dissolve,
and whatever's left is left.

00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:46.385
But you're not gonna miss
this fuckin' turd, right?

00:04:46.385 --> 00:04:49.888
So I take everything--I'm doing
these fuckin' liquid things,

00:04:49.888 --> 00:04:51.624
I'm doing everything,
'cause I gotta get--

00:04:51.624 --> 00:04:53.625
This tooth's
gotta come out by Wednesday,

00:04:53.625 --> 00:04:56.462
'cause I need it so fuckin' bad.

00:04:56.462 --> 00:04:59.632
And it's really going bad,
and I take--

00:04:59.632 --> 00:05:01.000
I'm eating a lot of food.

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.801
I'm trying to shovel
the stuff out.

00:05:02.801 --> 00:05:04.537
Anyone here
with the rest of the story?

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:06.739
It's gross, I know.
I know it is.

00:05:06.739 --> 00:05:08.541
And I'm actually
holding the strainer

00:05:08.541 --> 00:05:11.978
underneath my butt,
shittin' in it,

00:05:11.978 --> 00:05:16.015
trying to find this precious
piece of porcelain.

00:05:16.015 --> 00:05:18.084
But then I find at the store
this thing

00:05:18.084 --> 00:05:20.419
where it's a strainer,
but it has these things

00:05:20.419 --> 00:05:23.322
that you can pull out
and put it on a pot

00:05:23.322 --> 00:05:25.491
or a pot...

00:05:25.491 --> 00:05:28.327
and so now I'm fuckin'
hooked up, right?

00:05:28.327 --> 00:05:31.564
So, like, I can put this thing
down then put the lid down,

00:05:31.564 --> 00:05:33.666
and I don't have to hold
this thing between my legs

00:05:33.666 --> 00:05:37.837
to shit my tooth into my fucki''
bucket, right?

00:05:37.837 --> 00:05:41.373
So now I'm way more
high-tech than I used to be...

00:05:41.373 --> 00:05:44.844
and it's day two.

00:05:44.844 --> 00:05:48.047
And I'm like, "Oh, my God,
come on, Wednesday, come on,"

00:05:48.047 --> 00:05:50.282
and I'm just
so fuckin' sick of this.

00:05:50.282 --> 00:05:53.619
I been sitting on these fuckin'
commodes for two days.

00:05:53.619 --> 00:05:54.953
And I really--
I was so sick of it,

00:05:54.953 --> 00:05:57.022
and the only thing
that kept me going

00:05:57.022 --> 00:05:58.423
was I started to--

00:05:58.423 --> 00:06:01.360
pretending that that was
Nancy Grace's mouth.

00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.264
And...
[laughter]

00:06:06.566 --> 00:06:08.701
'Cause if you just thought,
you know,

00:06:08.701 --> 00:06:10.570
"I'm just shitting in
Nancy Grace's mouth,"

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:12.038
then you can keep going,
you know.

00:06:12.038 --> 00:06:15.441
You can keep going
for a little while.

00:06:15.441 --> 00:06:18.578
Day three.

00:06:18.578 --> 00:06:22.648
Turd. Nice turd we catch
in the strainer...bucket.

00:06:22.648 --> 00:06:24.817

Take it over.

00:06:24.817 --> 00:06:27.386

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:30.389
Last chance for romance
right here.

00:06:30.389 --> 00:06:33.058
My gig is in four hours.

00:06:33.058 --> 00:06:35.227
And there's the tooth.

00:06:35.227 --> 00:06:37.730
I found the fuckin' tooth.

00:06:37.730 --> 00:06:41.100
And I put it in
the dishwasher...

00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:42.634
[laughter]

00:06:42.634 --> 00:06:46.405

shove it back in my mouth?

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:48.006
And we go down there,

00:06:48.006 --> 00:06:50.943
and the fuckin' gig was
postponed till the next night.

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.745
