be steered so markets are not enough to
 

00:05:59.410 --> 00:06:01.410
be steered so markets are not enough to
ensure that we have that no innovation

00:06:01.410 --> 00:06:01.420
ensure that we have that no innovation
 

00:06:01.420 --> 00:06:03.480

give these two handed answers on the one

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:25.540
give these two handed answers on the one
 

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.330
give these two handed answers on the one
hand you could use intellectual property

00:06:27.330 --> 00:06:27.340
hand you could use intellectual property
 

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:28.920
hand you could use intellectual property
but on the other hand you could use

00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:28.930
but on the other hand you could use
 

00:06:28.930 --> 00:06:31.080
but on the other hand you could use
science you subsidize the research and

00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:31.090
science you subsidize the research and
 

00:06:31.090 --> 00:06:33.260
science you subsidize the research and
you you give the results away you know

00:06:33.260 --> 00:06:33.270
you you give the results away you know
 

00:06:33.270 --> 00:06:35.460
you you give the results away you know
President Truman said you wanted a

00:06:35.460 --> 00:06:35.470
President Truman said you wanted a
 

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:36.990
President Truman said you wanted a
one-armed economist because he was so

00:06:36.990 --> 00:06:37.000
one-armed economist because he was so
 

00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.050
one-armed economist because he was so
tired of on the one yeah but but but

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.060
tired of on the one yeah but but but
 

00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.340
tired of on the one yeah but but but
it's still important to remember that

00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:41.350
it's still important to remember that
 

00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:43.290
it's still important to remember that
that system of science that we all

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:43.300
that system of science that we all
 

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:45.720
that system of science that we all
participated in is a very good way to

00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:45.730
participated in is a very good way to
 

00:06:45.730 --> 00:06:47.700
participated in is a very good way to
produce discoveries and get them out

00:06:47.700 --> 00:06:47.710
produce discoveries and get them out

I mean your research looks at how the

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:53.490
I mean your research looks at how the
 

00:06:53.490 --> 00:06:55.980
I mean your research looks at how the
causes and consequences of climate

00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:55.990
causes and consequences of climate
 

00:06:55.990 --> 00:06:58.890

change and what can be done in economics
to try to tackle climate change I mean

00:07:02.400 --> 00:07:02.410
to try to tackle climate change I mean
 

00:07:02.410 --> 00:07:04.379
to try to tackle climate change I mean
what does your research tell us about

00:07:04.379 --> 00:07:04.389
what does your research tell us about
 

00:07:04.389 --> 00:07:06.900
what does your research tell us about
what's doable that climate change is bad

00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:06.910
what's doable that climate change is bad
 

00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:09.090
what's doable that climate change is bad
for the economy and that tackling it is

00:07:09.090 --> 00:07:09.100
for the economy and that tackling it is
 

00:07:09.100 --> 00:07:11.550
for the economy and that tackling it is
good for the economy well I'll just

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:11.560
good for the economy well I'll just
 

00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.790
good for the economy well I'll just
start where Paul Romer left off with

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:14.800
start where Paul Romer left off with
 

00:07:14.800 --> 00:07:17.189
start where Paul Romer left off with
innovation so we often think of

00:07:17.189 --> 00:07:17.199
innovation so we often think of
 

00:07:17.199 --> 00:07:19.740
innovation so we often think of
innovations and inventions in terms of

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:19.750
innovations and inventions in terms of
 

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:22.439
innovations and inventions in terms of
the things my my friends who have done

00:07:22.439 --> 00:07:22.449
the things my my friends who have done
 

00:07:22.449 --> 00:07:24.719
the things my my friends who have done
but let's just it this wasn't this was

00:07:24.719 --> 00:07:24.729
but let's just it this wasn't this was
 

00:07:24.729 --> 00:07:26.550
but let's just it this wasn't this was
in it this ballpoint pen was actually

00:07:26.550 --> 00:07:26.560
in it this ballpoint pen was actually
 

00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:29.279
in it this ballpoint pen was actually
historic innovation in about 50 years

00:07:29.279 --> 00:07:29.289
historic innovation in about 50 years
 

00:07:29.289 --> 00:07:32.480
historic innovation in about 50 years
ago but these often we think of these

00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:32.490
ago but these often we think of these
 

00:07:32.490 --> 00:07:34.980
ago but these often we think of these
gadgets so to speak or more fundamental

00:07:34.980 --> 00:07:34.990
gadgets so to speak or more fundamental
 

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.689
gadgets so to speak or more fundamental
ones but also there's a whole nother

00:07:36.689 --> 00:07:36.699
ones but also there's a whole nother
 

00:07:36.699 --> 00:07:38.129
ones but also there's a whole nother
class which are called institutional

00:07:38.129 --> 00:07:38.139
class which are called institutional
 

00:07:38.139 --> 00:07:40.980
class which are called institutional
inventions where we invent new

00:07:40.980 --> 00:07:40.990
inventions where we invent new
 

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:44.460
inventions where we invent new
institutions and in this field I think

00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:44.470
institutions and in this field I think
 

00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:46.800
institutions and in this field I think
the most important invention would be a

00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:46.810
the most important invention would be a
 

00:07:46.810 --> 00:07:49.590
the most important invention would be a
fiscal system to steer the economy

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:49.600
fiscal system to steer the economy
 

00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:51.570
fiscal system to steer the economy
whether it's a tax or another way of

00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:51.580
whether it's a tax or another way of
 

00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.510
whether it's a tax or another way of
raising the prices of carbon fuels this

00:07:54.510 --> 00:07:54.520
raising the prices of carbon fuels this
 

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:57.120
raising the prices of carbon fuels this
will steer the economy but this this is

00:07:57.120 --> 00:07:57.130
will steer the economy but this this is
 

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:59.520
will steer the economy but this this is
actually we think that's obvious but

00:07:59.520 --> 00:07:59.530
actually we think that's obvious but
 

00:07:59.530 --> 00:08:01.980
actually we think that's obvious but
actually this was an invention of an

00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:01.990
actually this was an invention of an
 

00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:03.629
actually this was an invention of an
institutional kind that has been made

00:08:03.629 --> 00:08:03.639
institutional kind that has been made
 

00:08:03.639 --> 00:08:06.240
institutional kind that has been made
over the last 60 or 70 years so you're

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:06.250
over the last 60 or 70 years so you're
 

00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:09.839
over the last 60 or 70 years so you're
an advocate of carbon tax which just

00:08:09.839 --> 00:08:09.849
an advocate of carbon tax which just
 

00:08:09.849 --> 00:08:11.850
an advocate of carbon tax which just
basically makes the use of fossil fuels

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:11.860
basically makes the use of fossil fuels
 

00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.600
basically makes the use of fossil fuels
dirty fossil fuels more expensive and

00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:14.610
dirty fossil fuels more expensive and
 

00:08:14.610 --> 00:08:17.279
dirty fossil fuels more expensive and

politically expedient is it well the

00:08:32.250 --> 00:08:32.260
politically expedient is it well the
 

00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:34.500
politically expedient is it well the
thing I would emphasize is not the

00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:34.510
thing I would emphasize is not the
 

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:38.010
thing I would emphasize is not the
carbon tax but the carbon price that you

00:08:38.010 --> 00:08:38.020
carbon tax but the carbon price that you
 

00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:40.949
carbon tax but the carbon price that you
need to raise the price of co2 emissions

00:08:40.949 --> 00:08:40.959
need to raise the price of co2 emissions
 

00:08:40.959 --> 00:08:44.219
need to raise the price of co2 emissions
and thereby raise the price of fuels and

00:08:44.219 --> 00:08:44.229
and thereby raise the price of fuels and
 

00:08:44.229 --> 00:08:46.380
and thereby raise the price of fuels and
all the products that the fuels are

00:08:46.380 --> 00:08:46.390
all the products that the fuels are
 

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.930
all the products that the fuels are
embodied in so it isn't just burning the

00:08:48.930 --> 00:08:48.940
embodied in so it isn't just burning the
 

00:08:48.940 --> 00:08:50.850

00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:20.220
cells from proliferating and one of the
ideas that I had was for some other

00:24:20.220 --> 00:24:20.230
ideas that I had was for some other
 

00:24:20.230 --> 00:24:23.010
ideas that I had was for some other
ideas after we figured that out was that

00:24:23.010 --> 00:24:23.020
ideas after we figured that out was that
 

00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:24.990
ideas after we figured that out was that
maybe the reason that the immune system

00:24:24.990 --> 00:24:25.000
maybe the reason that the immune system
 

00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.120
maybe the reason that the immune system
isn't so good at attacking cancer is

00:24:27.120 --> 00:24:27.130
isn't so good at attacking cancer is
 

00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:30.000
isn't so good at attacking cancer is
because it stops the T cells before you

00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:30.010
because it stops the T cells before you
 

00:24:30.010 --> 00:24:32.010
because it stops the T cells before you
have enough to kill all the tumor cells

00:24:32.010 --> 00:24:32.020
have enough to kill all the tumor cells
 

00:24:32.020 --> 00:24:34.260
have enough to kill all the tumor cells
and so if we just disabled the brakes

00:24:34.260 --> 00:24:34.270
and so if we just disabled the brakes
 

00:24:34.270 --> 00:24:36.420
and so if we just disabled the brakes
for a time we could let them keep going

00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:36.430
for a time we could let them keep going
 

00:24:36.430 --> 00:24:38.490
for a time we could let them keep going
until they you know eliminated all the

00:24:38.490 --> 00:24:38.500
until they you know eliminated all the
 

00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.740
until they you know eliminated all the
cancer cells and so that was the idea

00:24:40.740 --> 00:24:40.750
cancer cells and so that was the idea
 

00:24:40.750 --> 00:24:42.690
cancer cells and so that was the idea
pretty far-fetched because at the time

00:24:42.690 --> 00:24:42.700
pretty far-fetched because at the time
 

00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:44.700
pretty far-fetched because at the time
everybody thought that T cells divide

00:24:44.700 --> 00:24:44.710
everybody thought that T cells divide
 

00:24:44.710 --> 00:24:46.980
everybody thought that T cells divide
then they die it's not that this is an

00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:46.990
then they die it's not that this is an
 

00:24:46.990 --> 00:24:49.920
then they die it's not that this is an
active mechanism whose job tells us he

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:49.930
active mechanism whose job tells us he
 

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:52.080
active mechanism whose job tells us he
cells to stop it so that was your work

00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:52.090
cells to stop it so that was your work
 

00:24:52.090 --> 00:24:53.760
cells to stop it so that was your work
but what about You professor tasks you

00:24:53.760 --> 00:24:53.770
but what about You professor tasks you
 

00:24:53.770 --> 00:24:55.830
but what about You professor tasks you
Han Joe I mean you were working

00:24:55.830 --> 00:24:55.840
Han Joe I mean you were working
 

00:24:55.840 --> 00:24:58.470
Han Joe I mean you were working
independently and also discovered how to

00:24:58.470 --> 00:24:58.480
independently and also discovered how to
 

00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:01.140
independently and also discovered how to
kind of release the break in the immune

00:25:01.140 --> 00:25:01.150
kind of release the break in the immune
 

00:25:01.150 --> 00:25:02.550
kind of release the break in the immune
system which stops it from attacking

00:25:02.550 --> 00:25:02.560
system which stops it from attacking
 

00:25:02.560 --> 00:25:05.430
system which stops it from attacking
cancer cells but did you set about

00:25:05.430 --> 00:25:05.440
cancer cells but did you set about
 

00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:07.290
cancer cells but did you set about
trying to just understand how the immune

00:25:07.290 --> 00:25:07.300
trying to just understand how the immune
 

00:25:07.300 --> 00:25:08.550
trying to just understand how the immune
system works better or did you think

00:25:08.550 --> 00:25:08.560
system works better or did you think
 

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.010
system works better or did you think
yourself some treatment for cancer would

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:11.020
yourself some treatment for cancer would
 

00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:15.510
yourself some treatment for cancer would
be a really good ambition well in bottom

00:25:15.510 --> 00:25:15.520
be a really good ambition well in bottom
 

00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:19.850

hope to cure the cancer or any diseases

00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:28.270
hope to cure the cancer or any diseases
 

00:25:28.270 --> 00:25:31.110
hope to cure the cancer or any diseases
but when I started working the pd-1 it

00:25:31.110 --> 00:25:31.120
but when I started working the pd-1 it
 

00:25:31.120 --> 00:25:34.260
but when I started working the pd-1 it
was a just molecule we accidentally

00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:34.270
was a just molecule we accidentally
 

00:25:34.270 --> 00:25:39.270
was a just molecule we accidentally
identified starting the t-cell selection

00:25:39.270 --> 00:25:39.280
identified starting the t-cell selection
 

00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:42.390
identified starting the t-cell selection
or a regulation of that Tisa or gain but

00:25:42.390 --> 00:25:42.400
or a regulation of that Tisa or gain but
 

00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:46.440

when we found this is a different break

00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:46.450
when we found this is a different break
 

00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:51.990
when we found this is a different break
than Jim just mentioned and why immune

00:25:51.990 --> 00:25:52.000
than Jim just mentioned and why immune
 

00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.030
than Jim just mentioned and why immune
system is working so well against the

00:25:54.030 --> 00:25:54.040
system is working so well against the
 

00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:56.400
system is working so well against the
cancer because cancer just accumulate

00:25:56.400 --> 00:25:56.410
cancer because cancer just accumulate
 

00:25:56.410 --> 00:26:00.270
cancer because cancer just accumulate
mutations they become different from the

00:26:00.270 --> 00:26:00.280
mutations they become different from the
 

00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.660
mutations they become different from the
our body so that's what

00:26:03.660 --> 00:26:03.670
our body so that's what
 

00:26:03.670 --> 00:26:06.180
our body so that's what
reason why we can attack Professor Andre

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:06.190
reason why we can attack Professor Andre
 

00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:08.130
reason why we can attack Professor Andre
I mean there are hundreds of types of

00:26:08.130 --> 00:26:08.140
I mean there are hundreds of types of
 

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:10.440
I mean there are hundreds of types of
different cancers yes so when we talk

00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:10.450
different cancers yes so when we talk
 

00:26:10.450 --> 00:26:13.470
different cancers yes so when we talk
about treating cancer or curing cancer

00:26:13.470 --> 00:26:13.480
about treating cancer or curing cancer
 

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:17.670
about treating cancer or curing cancer
can can we actually cure cancer and can

00:26:17.670 --> 00:26:17.680
can can we actually cure cancer and can
 

00:26:17.680 --> 00:26:21.030
can can we actually cure cancer and can
we cure all sorts of cancers or we just

00:26:21.030 --> 00:26:21.040
we cure all sorts of cancers or we just
 

00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:23.700
we cure all sorts of cancers or we just
talking about some specific ones well at

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:23.710
talking about some specific ones well at
 

00:26:23.710 --> 00:26:25.920
talking about some specific ones well at
this moment there are several cancers

00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:25.930
this moment there are several cancers
 

00:26:25.930 --> 00:26:30.750
this moment there are several cancers
which we can cure some which very

00:26:30.750 --> 00:26:30.760
which we can cure some which very
 

00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:34.740
which we can cure some which very
difficult there are several reasons one

00:26:34.740 --> 00:26:34.750
difficult there are several reasons one
 

00:26:34.750 --> 00:26:39.480
difficult there are several reasons one
is the immune system cannot approach to

00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:39.490
is the immune system cannot approach to
 

00:26:39.490 --> 00:26:43.260
is the immune system cannot approach to
the site where the tumor is located some

00:26:43.260 --> 00:26:43.270
the site where the tumor is located some
 

00:26:43.270 --> 00:26:46.920
the site where the tumor is located some
cancers do not express so many different

00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:46.930
cancers do not express so many different
 

00:26:46.930 --> 00:26:50.970
cancers do not express so many different
molecule normal cells mean the mutation

00:26:50.970 --> 00:26:50.980
molecule normal cells mean the mutation
 

00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:55.380
molecule normal cells mean the mutation
rate is low so at this stage we can say

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:55.390
rate is low so at this stage we can say
 

00:26:55.390 --> 00:26:58.590
rate is low so at this stage we can say
we conquer the cancer it's just

00:26:58.590 --> 00:26:58.600
we conquer the cancer it's just
 

00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:01.530
we conquer the cancer it's just
beginning of the whole story so we need

00:27:01.530 --> 00:27:01.540
beginning of the whole story so we need
 

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:04.980
beginning of the whole story so we need
lots of research professor Jim Allison I

00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:04.990
lots of research professor Jim Allison I

lots of research professor Jim Allison I
know that you personally have had a lot

00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:07.330
know that you personally have had a lot
 

00:27:07.330 --> 00:27:10.050
know that you personally have had a lot
of experience with cancer you yourself

00:27:10.050 --> 00:27:10.060
of experience with cancer you yourself
 

00:27:10.060 --> 00:27:11.640
of experience with cancer you yourself
have had three types accounts so you

00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:11.650
have had three types accounts so you
 

00:27:11.650 --> 00:27:13.560

what what happened so I was 22 just out

00:27:44.100 --> 00:27:44.110
what what happened so I was 22 just out
 

00:27:44.110 --> 00:27:45.780
what what happened so I was 22 just out
of grad school and I found out that I

00:27:45.780 --> 00:27:45.790
of grad school and I found out that I
 

00:27:45.790 --> 00:27:48.420

a clinical trial for an immunotherapy
and it worked

00:28:08.640 --> 00:28:08.650

00:37:09.470 --> 00:37:09.480
laser indeed
 

00:37:09.480 --> 00:37:11.960

but what kind of laser do you have and
 

00:37:11.970 --> 00:37:15.530

the student said you know why are asking
 

00:37:15.540 --> 00:37:18.079

a ridiculous thing to say that and I
 

00:38:44.240 --> 00:38:45.340
a ridiculous thing to say that and I
couldn't say that to a teacher so I

00:38:45.340 --> 00:38:45.350
couldn't say that to a teacher so I
 

00:38:45.350 --> 00:38:47.320

about implicit bias and the fact that

00:38:59.680 --> 00:38:59.690
about implicit bias and the fact that
 

00:38:59.690 --> 00:39:01.690
about implicit bias and the fact that
you might not think you're prejudiced

00:39:01.690 --> 00:39:01.700
you might not think you're prejudiced
 

00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.300

against one type of thing or another but

against one type of thing or another but
that somehow your background idea is

that somehow your background idea is

that somehow your background idea is
coming to play and that you have to

coming to play and that you have to
 

00:39:08.690 --> 00:39:10.180
coming to play and that you have to
learn to get around that and so I think

00:39:10.180 --> 00:39:10.190
learn to get around that and so I think

they're just not being encouraged in

they're just not being encouraged in

well in the past of course the the

00:39:40.060 --> 00:39:40.070
well in the past of course the the
 

00:39:40.070 --> 00:39:42.790
well in the past of course the the
numbers were very low and that that is

00:39:42.790 --> 00:39:42.800
numbers were very low and that that is
 

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.430

agree with Donna that's going to change

00:39:50.410 --> 00:39:50.420
agree with Donna that's going to change
 

00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.359
agree with Donna that's going to change
and it's going to change fast because

00:39:52.359 --> 00:39:52.369
and it's going to change fast because
 

00:39:52.369 --> 00:39:54.130
and it's going to change fast because
women are doing science at the highest

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:54.140
women are doing science at the highest
 

00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.010
women are doing science at the highest
levels and they make up 50% of the most

00:39:57.010 --> 00:39:57.020
levels and they make up 50% of the most
 

00:39:57.020 --> 00:39:59.890
levels and they make up 50% of the most
brilliant minds so and they're doing

00:39:59.890 --> 00:39:59.900
brilliant minds so and they're doing
 

00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:02.740
brilliant minds so and they're doing
science now so I'm looking forward to a

science now so I'm looking forward to a
 

00:40:02.750 --> 00:40:05.890

anything wrong about it or weird about

know it was she was a flange you know if

00:40:46.510 --> 00:40:46.520
know it was she was a flange you know if
 

00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:52.870
know it was she was a flange you know if
you saw a woman yes it's changing fast

00:40:52.870 --> 00:40:52.880
you saw a woman yes it's changing fast

well come to the end of this discussion
 

00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:14.620
well come to the end of this discussion
just want to ask you all and you've

00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:14.630
just want to ask you all and you've

accolade receiving a Nobel Prize what
next George Smith well I'm retired so I

00:41:26.650 --> 00:41:26.660
next George Smith well I'm retired so I
 

00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:30.609
next George Smith well I'm retired so I
bought long since a thought of what next

00:41:30.609 --> 00:41:30.619
bought long since a thought of what next
 

00:41:30.619 --> 00:41:34.810
bought long since a thought of what next
I took a couple months retirement from

00:41:34.810 --> 00:41:34.820
I took a couple months retirement from
 

00:41:34.820 --> 00:41:40.630
I took a couple months retirement from
my retirement just now but I guess the

00:41:40.630 --> 00:41:40.640
my retirement just now but I guess the
 

00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:44.310
my retirement just now but I guess the
first one thing that's next is I have to

00:41:44.310 --> 00:41:44.320
first one thing that's next is I have to
 

00:41:44.320 --> 00:41:48.760
first one thing that's next is I have to
learn that I don't know everything the

00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:48.770
learn that I don't know everything the
 

00:41:48.770 --> 00:41:53.020
learn that I don't know everything the

way Nobel Prize laureates are encouraged
 

00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:58.290
way Nobel Prize laureates are encouraged
to think of but my future is really not

00:41:58.290 --> 00:41:58.300
to think of but my future is really not
 

00:41:58.300 --> 00:42:01.900
to think of but my future is really not
specifically in science but maybe in the

00:42:01.900 --> 00:42:01.910
specifically in science but maybe in the
 

00:42:01.910 --> 00:42:06.430
specifically in science but maybe in the
collectivity professor no well for me I

00:42:06.430 --> 00:42:06.440
collectivity professor no well for me I
 

00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:09.060
collectivity professor no well for me I
don't think anything is going to change

00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:09.070
don't think anything is going to change
 

00:42:09.070 --> 00:42:13.420
don't think anything is going to change
because what I like is right science and

00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:13.430
because what I like is right science and
 

00:42:13.430 --> 00:42:15.820
because what I like is right science and
so it's not because I get this Nobel

00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:15.830
so it's not because I get this Nobel
 

00:42:15.830 --> 00:42:17.589
so it's not because I get this Nobel
Prize but I'm going to change my habits

00:42:17.589 --> 00:42:17.599
Prize but I'm going to change my habits
 

00:42:17.599 --> 00:42:21.520
Prize but I'm going to change my habits
I think on the contrary I think I'm

00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:21.530
I think on the contrary I think I'm
 

00:42:21.530 --> 00:42:24.460
I think on the contrary I think I'm
going to do it better because now of

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:24.470
going to do it better because now of
 

00:42:24.470 --> 00:42:27.070
going to do it better because now of
course you know when when someone with

00:42:27.070 --> 00:42:27.080
course you know when when someone with
 

00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:31.000
course you know when when someone with
another prize speaks people listen you

00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:31.010
another prize speaks people listen you
 

00:42:31.010 --> 00:42:34.180
another prize speaks people listen you
know and so I'm I'm going to try to do

00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:34.190
know and so I'm I'm going to try to do
 

00:42:34.190 --> 00:42:38.300
know and so I'm I'm going to try to do
the same thing but better

00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:38.310
the same thing but better
 

00:42:38.310 --> 00:42:41.990
the same thing but better
don't know what else what next

00:42:41.990 --> 00:42:42.000
don't know what else what next
 

00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:44.540
don't know what else what next
well I'll continue to work on the things

00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:44.550
well I'll continue to work on the things
 

00:42:44.550 --> 00:42:46.600
well I'll continue to work on the things
I've worked on recently which are

00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:46.610
I've worked on recently which are
 

00:42:46.610 --> 00:42:50.120
I've worked on recently which are
climate change but actually I began

00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:50.130
climate change but actually I began
 

00:42:50.130 --> 00:42:52.130
climate change but actually I began
working in much the same area Paul Romer

00:42:52.130 --> 00:42:52.140
working in much the same area Paul Romer
 

00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:54.580
working in much the same area Paul Romer
did his work which was on technology and

00:42:54.580 --> 00:42:54.590
did his work which was on technology and
 

00:42:54.590 --> 00:42:56.840
did his work which was on technology and
technology has brought has been miracles

00:42:56.840 --> 00:42:56.850
technology has brought has been miracles
 

00:42:56.850 --> 00:42:58.250
technology has brought has been miracles
I mean we're living here rather than

00:42:58.250 --> 00:42:58.260
I mean we're living here rather than
 

00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:01.130
I mean we're living here rather than
caves because of technology but just as

00:43:01.130 --> 00:43:01.140
caves because of technology but just as
 

00:43:01.140 --> 00:43:03.020
caves because of technology but just as
economic growth has side effects that

00:43:03.020 --> 00:43:03.030
economic growth has side effects that
 

00:43:03.030 --> 00:43:06.110
economic growth has side effects that
dark side effects like climate change I

00:43:06.110 --> 00:43:06.120
dark side effects like climate change I
 

00:43:06.120 --> 00:43:09.050
dark side effects like climate change I
also think technology has dark sides and

00:43:09.050 --> 00:43:09.060
also think technology has dark sides and
 

00:43:09.060 --> 00:43:11.870
also think technology has dark sides and
I particularly am concerned about its

00:43:11.870 --> 00:43:11.880
I particularly am concerned about its
 

00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:14.270
I particularly am concerned about its
dark side on our institutions on our

00:43:14.270 --> 00:43:14.280
dark side on our institutions on our
 

00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.190
dark side on our institutions on our
democracies and I'm particularly

00:43:16.190 --> 00:43:16.200
democracies and I'm particularly
 

00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:18.230
democracies and I'm particularly
concerned about the role of social media

00:43:18.230 --> 00:43:18.240
concerned about the role of social media
 

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:21.410
concerned about the role of social media
like Facebook or on our institutions

00:43:21.410 --> 00:43:21.420
like Facebook or on our institutions
 

00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.540
like Facebook or on our institutions
professor Jim Allison well I think

00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:23.550
professor Jim Allison well I think
 

00:43:23.550 --> 00:43:25.610
professor Jim Allison well I think
that's we've shown now that we could

00:43:25.610 --> 00:43:25.620
that's we've shown now that we could
 

00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:27.740
that's we've shown now that we could
cure some patients with cancer I have

00:43:27.740 --> 00:43:27.750
cure some patients with cancer I have
 

00:43:27.750 --> 00:43:30.320
cure some patients with cancer I have
the goal of trying to get that rate it's

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:30.330
the goal of trying to get that rate it's
 

00:43:30.330 --> 00:43:32.870
the goal of trying to get that rate it's
close to a hundred percent I possibly

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:32.880
close to a hundred percent I possibly
 

00:43:32.880 --> 00:43:35.450
close to a hundred percent I possibly
can and and there's many different kinds

00:43:35.450 --> 00:43:35.460
can and and there's many different kinds
 

00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.610
can and and there's many different kinds
of cancers we have and I'm hoping that

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:37.620
of cancers we have and I'm hoping that
 

00:43:37.620 --> 00:43:41.120
of cancers we have and I'm hoping that
the surprise again well give me out a

00:43:41.120 --> 00:43:41.130
the surprise again well give me out a
 

00:43:41.130 --> 00:43:43.520
the surprise again well give me out a
bit of a soapbox first it's shown that

00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:43.530
bit of a soapbox first it's shown that
 

00:43:43.530 --> 00:43:45.260
bit of a soapbox first it's shown that
immunotherapy works which everybody was

00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:45.270
immunotherapy works which everybody was
 

00:43:45.270 --> 00:43:47.180
immunotherapy works which everybody was
skeptical about before and hopefully

00:43:47.180 --> 00:43:47.190
skeptical about before and hopefully
 

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:50.120
skeptical about before and hopefully
I'll help bring more funding and help us

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:50.130
I'll help bring more funding and help us
 

00:43:50.130 --> 00:43:52.730
I'll help bring more funding and help us
get the work done but also to other

00:43:52.730 --> 00:43:52.740
get the work done but also to other
 

00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:54.380
get the work done but also to other
things that may not be so obvious what I

00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:54.390
things that may not be so obvious what I
 

00:43:54.390 --> 00:43:57.830
things that may not be so obvious what I
miss - I'll let patients you know have

00:43:57.830 --> 00:43:57.840
miss - I'll let patients you know have
 

00:43:57.840 --> 00:43:59.810
miss - I'll let patients you know have
hope that their you know death of cancer

00:43:59.810 --> 00:43:59.820
hope that their you know death of cancer
 

00:43:59.820 --> 00:44:01.730
hope that their you know death of cancer
diagnosis of cancer isn't necessarily a

00:44:01.730 --> 00:44:01.740
diagnosis of cancer isn't necessarily a
 

00:44:01.740 --> 00:44:03.710
diagnosis of cancer isn't necessarily a
death sentence and you know they can

00:44:03.710 --> 00:44:03.720
death sentence and you know they can
 

00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:05.570
death sentence and you know they can
actually some at least can be to be

00:44:05.570 --> 00:44:05.580
actually some at least can be to be
 

00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:07.850
actually some at least can be to be
cured and the second and the final one

00:44:07.850 --> 00:44:07.860
cured and the second and the final one
 

00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:11.000
cured and the second and the final one
is that I think I hope that the prize

00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:11.010
is that I think I hope that the prize
 

00:44:11.010 --> 00:44:14.180
is that I think I hope that the prize
will inspire more patients to

00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:14.190
will inspire more patients to
 

00:44:14.190 --> 00:44:16.100
will inspire more patients to
participate in clinical trials which

00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:16.110
participate in clinical trials which
 

00:44:16.110 --> 00:44:19.280
participate in clinical trials which
will help us progress faster professor

00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:19.290
will help us progress faster professor

actually two dreams one is to get a
 

00:44:26.370 --> 00:44:31.340
actually two dreams one is to get a
Nobel Prize but the other one is the age

00:44:31.340 --> 00:44:31.350
Nobel Prize but the other one is the age
 

00:44:31.350 --> 00:44:36.279

week I have to say my immediate goal is

00:44:42.019 --> 00:44:42.029
week I have to say my immediate goal is
 

00:44:42.029 --> 00:44:46.279
week I have to say my immediate goal is
to get some sleep but I'm very excited

00:44:46.279 --> 00:44:46.289
to get some sleep but I'm very excited
 

00:44:46.289 --> 00:44:49.579
to get some sleep but I'm very excited
about the future of evolution and how I

00:44:49.579 --> 00:44:49.589
about the future of evolution and how I
 

00:44:49.589 --> 00:44:53.209
about the future of evolution and how I
have one good idea in the 1980s and I've

00:44:53.209 --> 00:44:53.219
have one good idea in the 1980s and I've
 

00:44:53.219 --> 00:44:56.179
have one good idea in the 1980s and I've
worked it ever since but there are such

00:44:56.179 --> 00:44:56.189
worked it ever since but there are such
 

00:44:56.189 --> 00:44:58.639
worked it ever since but there are such
amazing things that we can use to move

00:44:58.639 --> 00:44:58.649
amazing things that we can use to move
 

00:44:58.649 --> 00:45:00.949
amazing things that we can use to move
into the future and the combination with

00:45:00.949 --> 00:45:00.959
into the future and the combination with
 

00:45:00.959 --> 00:45:02.449
into the future and the combination with

intelligence is a frontier that I'm

00:45:05.539 --> 00:45:05.549
intelligence is a frontier that I'm
 

00:45:05.549 --> 00:45:08.089
intelligence is a frontier that I'm
going to ride to the next level

00:45:08.089 --> 00:45:08.099
going to ride to the next level
 

00:45:08.099 --> 00:45:10.579
going to ride to the next level
Jonah Strickland well I mean I have to

Jonah Strickland well I mean I have to
say that my life has been turned upside

00:45:12.259 --> 00:45:12.269
say that my life has been turned upside
 

00:45:12.269 --> 00:45:14.109
say that my life has been turned upside
down because of a Nobel Prize and

00:45:14.109 --> 00:45:14.119
down because of a Nobel Prize and
 

00:45:14.119 --> 00:45:16.669
down because of a Nobel Prize and
everybody wants to hear from a Nobel

00:45:16.669 --> 00:45:16.679
everybody wants to hear from a Nobel
 

00:45:16.679 --> 00:45:18.619
everybody wants to hear from a Nobel
Prize so I'm already booking into 2020

00:45:18.619 --> 00:45:18.629
Prize so I'm already booking into 2020
 

00:45:18.629 --> 00:45:20.899
Prize so I'm already booking into 2020
at this point but I agree with George

00:45:20.899 --> 00:45:20.909
at this point but I agree with George
 

00:45:20.909 --> 00:45:22.369
at this point but I agree with George
that some some of the people that

00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:22.379
that some some of the people that
 

00:45:22.379 --> 00:45:23.899

actually want to hear from me all of a

00:45:23.899 --> 00:45:23.909
actually want to hear from me all of a
 

00:45:23.909 --> 00:45:26.509
actually want to hear from me all of a
sudden are the politicians and I do have

00:45:26.509 --> 00:45:26.519
sudden are the politicians and I do have
 

00:45:26.519 --> 00:45:28.009
sudden are the politicians and I do have
some public policy work that is not

00:45:28.009 --> 00:45:28.019
some public policy work that is not
 

00:45:28.019 --> 00:45:29.239
some public policy work that is not
about my own research but about

00:45:29.239 --> 00:45:29.249
about my own research but about
 

00:45:29.249 --> 00:45:31.309
about my own research but about
photonics in general and how important

00:45:31.309 --> 00:45:31.319
photonics in general and how important
 

00:45:31.319 --> 00:45:34.009
photonics in general and how important
it is and I'm getting that opportunity

00:45:34.009 --> 00:45:34.019
it is and I'm getting that opportunity
 

00:45:34.019 --> 00:45:36.229
it is and I'm getting that opportunity
to speak to government leaders and and

00:45:36.229 --> 00:45:36.239
to speak to government leaders and and
 

00:45:36.239 --> 00:45:39.919
to speak to government leaders and and
try to explain that and in particular we

00:45:39.919 --> 00:45:39.929
try to explain that and in particular we
 

00:45:39.929 --> 00:45:41.629
try to explain that and in particular we
think photonics has a huge role to play

00:45:41.629 --> 00:45:41.639
think photonics has a huge role to play
 

00:45:41.639 --> 00:45:43.939
think photonics has a huge role to play
in environmental measurement and

00:45:43.939 --> 00:45:43.949
in environmental measurement and
 

00:45:43.949 --> 00:45:45.979
in environmental measurement and
monitoring so we can try to do all these

00:45:45.979 --> 00:45:45.989
monitoring so we can try to do all these
 

00:45:45.989 --> 00:45:47.869
monitoring so we can try to do all these
things for climate control but we have

00:45:47.869 --> 00:45:47.879
things for climate control but we have
 

00:45:47.879 --> 00:45:49.339
things for climate control but we have
to know that we've done them and so we

00:45:49.339 --> 00:45:49.349
to know that we've done them and so we
 

00:45:49.349 --> 00:45:51.169
to know that we've done them and so we
think photonics has a huge role for that

00:45:51.169 --> 00:45:51.179
think photonics has a huge role for that
 

00:45:51.179 --> 00:45:53.329
think photonics has a huge role for that
and so that's one of the things that I'm

00:45:53.329 --> 00:45:53.339
and so that's one of the things that I'm
 

00:45:53.339 --> 00:45:55.129
and so that's one of the things that I'm
out there pushing in public policy and

00:45:55.129 --> 00:45:55.139
out there pushing in public policy and
 

00:45:55.139 --> 00:45:58.579
out there pushing in public policy and
