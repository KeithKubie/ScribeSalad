00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:03.400
Let's say we have
100 light bulbs.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.980
Well, let me actually
just draw them.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.860
So I have one light
bulb there.

00:00:08.860 --> 00:00:12.100
I have another light bulb.

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.760
And I have 100 of them.

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:16.490
100 light bulbs.

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:20.380
And what I'm going to do is--
Well actually, before I even

00:00:20.380 --> 00:00:23.290
start turning these light bulbs
on and off, let me let

00:00:23.290 --> 00:00:25.260
you know that they
are all off.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:26.520
So they start off.

00:00:30.440 --> 00:00:33.110
Now, the next thing I'm going
to do is I'm going to number

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:34.110
the hundred light bulbs.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:35.590
I'm going to number them
one through 100.

00:00:35.590 --> 00:00:37.750
So the first light bulb
is light bulb one.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.780
The second light bulb
is light bulb two.

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.610
All the way to light bulb 100.

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:46.250
And what I'm going to do is,
first I'm going to go and I'm

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:53.810
going to switch essentially
every light bulb.

00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:58.210
So if they all start off, I'm
going to turn them all on.

00:00:58.210 --> 00:01:00.690
So let me do it.

00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.110
So on my first pass-- let's
call this pass one-- so in

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:08.810
pass one, I'm going to
turn all of these on.

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:11.750
On, on, on.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:14.240
They're all going
to be turned on.

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.130
On.

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:18.430
And then in pass two, what I'm
going to do is I'm going to

00:01:18.430 --> 00:01:22.820
switch only every other
light bulb.

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.430
So, for example I'll say, OK, I
won't switch light bulb one.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.470
I'll only switch
light bulb two.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:31.680
So light bulb one
will stay on.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:34.220
Light bulb two will be off.

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:35.910
Light bulb three will be on.

00:01:35.910 --> 00:01:38.180
Light bulb four will be off.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:40.770
And so essentially, every light
bulb-- if you look at

00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:43.500
their numbers-- that
is a multiple of

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:45.010
two, will be switched.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:49.720
So 100 will be switched,
so that'll also be off.

00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.920
Then I'm going to come-- and
ignore this right here-- and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:56.530
I'm going to switch every
third light bulb.

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.990
So what's going to happen?

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.120
This one's going to-- let me
switch colors arbitrarily--

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:01.850
this one's going to stay on.

00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:03.330
This one's going to stay off.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.320
And I'm going to switch
the third light bulb.

00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:06.720
So this one was on.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.710
Now this one will be off.

00:02:10.710 --> 00:02:13.510
The fourth light bulb will
stay off, because I'm not

00:02:13.510 --> 00:02:14.370
touching it.

00:02:14.370 --> 00:02:19.680
The fifth light bulb
would have been on

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.890
and it'll stay on.

00:02:20.890 --> 00:02:23.510
Now the sixth light bulb, in
this case we switched it off,

00:02:23.510 --> 00:02:24.530
and now it'll be on again.

00:02:24.530 --> 00:02:25.690
But I think you get the point.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.330
Every third light bulb, or if we
look at the numbers of the

00:02:28.330 --> 00:02:31.930
light bulb, every numbered light
bulb would that is a

00:02:31.930 --> 00:02:34.700
multiple of three is going
to be switched.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.320
And if it was a multiple of
three and two, it would have

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:40.020
been switched on the
first time and then

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:41.020
off the second time.

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:42.660
But I think you're getting
the point.

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.240
But what I'm going to do is,
I'm going to do 100 passes.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:47.830
So the first pass, I switch
every light bulb.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.360
They all started off,
so they're all going

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:50.700
to be turned on.

00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:53.750
The second pass, I switch every
other light bulb or

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:55.110
every second light bulb.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:58.960
The third pass, I do every
third one, or that's a

00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:00.630
multiple of three.

00:03:00.630 --> 00:03:16.130
And my question to you is, after
100 passes, how many

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:19.780
light bulbs are still on?

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.165
Or how many are on, period?

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.090
And that is the brain teaser?

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:32.220
How do you figure out, of
the hundred, which ones

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:33.020
are going to be on?

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:34.340
You should be able to do
this in your head.

00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:36.890
You don't have to make an Excel
spreadsheet and actually

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.200
do all the on and
off switches.

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:41.260
So the first question is, how
many of these are going to be

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:42.850
on after I do 100 passes?

00:03:42.850 --> 00:03:44.110
And just to make it clear,
what's the 100th

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:45.050
path going to be?

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:48.080
Well, I'm only going to switch
every 100th light bulb.

00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:50.630
So whatever this light bulb was
already doing, I'm just

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:51.360
going to switch it.

00:03:51.360 --> 00:03:53.140
If it was off, it'll come on.

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:54.770
If it was on, it'll
become off.

00:03:54.770 --> 00:03:57.200
So the first question is, how
many of these are going to be

00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.450
on after 100 passes?

00:03:58.450 --> 00:04:01.080
And then the bonus question
is, which of these

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.710
are going to be on?

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:04.100
And so that's the question.

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.980
Pause it if you don't
want the answer.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:07.960
And then try to solve it.

00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:09.850
I think it shouldn't take
you too much time.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.450
But now I'm going to give
you the answer.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.160
Or maybe I'll start with
a couple of hints.

00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:21.050
So, when do we know that a light
bulb is being switched?

00:04:21.050 --> 00:04:25.380
So if I'm on the second
pass, I will-- I don't

00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.030
want to say turn on.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:26.770
It might already be on.

00:04:26.770 --> 00:04:30.190
I will switch every light bulb
that's divisible by two.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:32.875
And then if I'm on the third
pass, I'll switch every light

00:04:32.875 --> 00:04:34.640
bulb that's divisible
by three.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:39.220
So on every pass,
what am I doing?

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:45.210
If I'm on pass n-- this
is a hint if you want

00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:51.340
it-- what do I know?

00:04:51.340 --> 00:04:56.880
I know all the light bulbs that
are numbered where n is a

00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:00.480
factor of that light bulb,
that will get switched.

00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:11.380
So we know that switched
if n is a factor of

00:05:11.380 --> 00:05:13.620
the light bulb number.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:20.240
And that's just a fancy way of
saying, look, if I'm on pass

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:24.320
17, I'm going to switch all
the multiples of 17.

00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:26.920
Or I could say, I know that I'm
going to switch light bulb

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:31.300
51, because 17 is
a factor of 51.

00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:33.750
So that tells you that we're
always going to be switching

00:05:33.750 --> 00:05:36.960
one of these light bulbs on
or off when one of its

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.930
factors is our pass.

00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:51.400
So for example, if we're looking
at light bulb eight.

00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:52.930
This is light bulb eight.

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:54.340
So when will it be switched?

00:05:54.340 --> 00:05:56.153
So on pass one, we're
definitely going

00:05:56.153 --> 00:05:56.660
to switch it on.

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.660
So pass one, it's going
to be switched on.

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.690
Pass two, it'll be
switched off.

00:06:01.690 --> 00:06:04.640
I know that because two is
divisible into eight.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:07.740
Pass three, nothing's
going to happen.

00:06:07.740 --> 00:06:10.270
On pass three, nothing's going
to happen because this isn't a

00:06:10.270 --> 00:06:11.710
multiple of three.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:13.660
Pass four, what'll happen?

00:06:13.660 --> 00:06:14.480
It will be switched.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:16.720
It'll be switched back on.

00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.950
And then pass eight is the next
time we'll touch this

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:22.680
light bulb, and it'll
be switched back.

00:06:22.680 --> 00:06:25.510
So every time one of its factors
go by, we're going to

00:06:25.510 --> 00:06:26.800
switch this thing.

00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:30.630
And as you can see, in order
for it to be on at the end,

00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:33.150
you have to have an odd
number of factors.

00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:35.200
So that's an interesting
thing.

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:47.920
So in order for a light bulb to
be on, it has to have odd

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:52.036
number of factors.

00:06:52.036 --> 00:06:53.850
Now that's an interesting
question.

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:56.740
What numbers have an odd
number of factors.

00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.210
And this is something that I
think they should teach you in

00:06:58.210 --> 00:06:59.820
grade school, and
they never do.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:03.230
But it's a really interesting
kind of number theory.

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.540
It's a simple one, but it's
interesting to think about.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.160
So what numbers are true?

00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:11.310
Let's do all the factors for
some of the starting numbers.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:13.030
So all the factors of one.

00:07:13.030 --> 00:07:15.290
Well one, the only factor
is just one.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:16.200
So one works?

00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.190
One has an odd number
of factors.

00:07:18.190 --> 00:07:20.190
So that means that one
will remain on.

00:07:20.190 --> 00:07:22.400
Because you're only going to
turn it on in the first pass.

00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.930
Makes sense.

00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:24.750
Two.

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:25.860
What are all the
factors of two.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.040
Well you have one and two.

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.470
So two has an even number.

00:07:29.470 --> 00:07:31.740
You're going to switch it on the
first time, then off the

00:07:31.740 --> 00:07:32.280
second time.

00:07:32.280 --> 00:07:33.360
Then you're never going
to touch it again.

00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:35.060
So this is going to stay off.

00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.980
Three.

00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:38.300
Your factors are
one and three.

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:39.250
Four.

00:07:39.250 --> 00:07:43.780
Your factors are one,
two and four.

00:07:43.780 --> 00:07:44.670
Interesting.

00:07:44.670 --> 00:07:47.000
Here we have three factors.

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.040
We have an odd number
of factors.

00:07:49.040 --> 00:07:52.380
So four is going to stay on.

00:07:52.380 --> 00:07:54.770
We're going to turn it on in our
first pass, we're going to

00:07:54.770 --> 00:07:56.530
turn it off on our
second pass.

00:07:56.530 --> 00:07:58.960
And we're going to turn it on
again in our fourth pass.

00:07:58.960 --> 00:08:00.660
Let's keep going.

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:01.622
So five.

00:08:01.622 --> 00:08:05.290
The factors of five
are one and five.

00:08:05.290 --> 00:08:05.770
Six.

00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:08.210
The factors are one,
two, three and six.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.540
It's an even number, so they're
going to be off when

00:08:10.540 --> 00:08:11.790
we're done with it.

00:08:11.790 --> 00:08:12.360
Seven.

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:14.340
it's one and seven.

00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:14.850
Eight.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:15.620
We just did that.

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.790
It's one, two, four and eight.

00:08:17.790 --> 00:08:19.310
Still going to be off.

00:08:19.310 --> 00:08:20.860
Nine.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:21.190
Let's see.

00:08:21.190 --> 00:08:21.800
Nine.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.450
The factors are one,
three and nine.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:26.090
Interesting.

00:08:26.090 --> 00:08:28.700
Once again we have an odd
number of factors.

00:08:28.700 --> 00:08:34.880
So the light bulb number nine
is also going to be on when

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:36.230
everything's done.

00:08:36.230 --> 00:08:37.400
Let's keep going.

00:08:37.400 --> 00:08:40.830
I don't know, I actually did
this at our mental boot camp

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:41.419
with some of the kids.

00:08:41.419 --> 00:08:43.200
And they immediately said,
the distance between

00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.380
one and four is three.

00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.870
The distance between four
and nine is five.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:52.810
And maybe the distance between
nine and the next number is

00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:54.500
going to be seven.

00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:56.260
It increases by odd numbers.

00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:57.110
What's nine plus seven?

00:08:57.110 --> 00:08:57.890
Let's just try that out.

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.060
16.

00:08:59.060 --> 00:09:00.940
What are the factors of 16?

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:07.640
They're one, two, four,
eight and 16.

00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:08.100
Interesting.

00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:08.870
That worked, right?

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:12.430
From nine to 16, you incremented
by seven.

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:15.220
From four to nine, you
incremented by five.

00:09:15.220 --> 00:09:16.530
So it seems like we
have a pattern.

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:19.080
But can you see something even
more interesting about the

00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:23.960
numbers one, four,
nine and 16.

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:25.770
And you could try all the
numbers between nine and 16,

00:09:25.770 --> 00:09:28.380
and you'll see that they have
an even number of factors.

00:09:28.380 --> 00:09:31.030
But what's interesting about
all of these numbers?

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:33.830
Why do they have an odd
number of factors?

00:09:33.830 --> 00:09:36.720
In all of these other cases,
every factor is paired with

00:09:36.720 --> 00:09:37.450
another number.

00:09:37.450 --> 00:09:38.920
One times two is two.

00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:40.770
One time six is six.

00:09:40.770 --> 00:09:41.850
Two times three is six.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.990
There's always a pair.

00:09:42.990 --> 00:09:45.360
Except for these numbers.

00:09:45.360 --> 00:09:46.670
There's no pair.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.530
Why isn't there?

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.740
One times four is four.

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:53.650
But two times two
is also four.

00:09:53.650 --> 00:09:55.860
So we only write the two once.

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.560
Three times three is nine.

00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.480
Four times four is 16.

00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.730
So all the lights that are going
to be on are actually

00:10:01.730 --> 00:10:02.890
perfect squares.

00:10:02.890 --> 00:10:06.040
That's why they have an
odd number of factors.

00:10:06.040 --> 00:10:08.810
So what's our question?

00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:12.300
So this problem of what light
bulbs are going to be on,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.170
boils down to how many perfect
squares are there

00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.760
between one and 100?

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:18.580
And you could just
list them out.

00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:20.950
And you could say, oh well
the perfect squares are

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:24.070
one, four, nine, 16.

00:10:24.070 --> 00:10:25.430
And you could try to
think of them all.

00:10:25.430 --> 00:10:27.680
Or you could say, well how many
numbers can I square and

00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:30.890
get a number less than
or equal to 100?

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:35.270
Well 100 is equal
to 10 squared.

00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.120
So you can only square the
numbers between one and 10 to

00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.220
get a perfect square.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.130
So there's only 10 perfect
squares between one and 100.

00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:45.010
Hopefully you didn't lose that,
but if that confuses

00:10:45.010 --> 00:10:47.180
you, just list them all out.

00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:50.780
Given that 100 is the largest
number, it's the whole largest

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:51.470
perfect square there.

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:53.330
And that's 10 squared.

00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:56.370
The only other perfect squares
in our range we're talking

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:58.160
about are one squared, two
squared, three squared, all

00:10:58.160 --> 00:10:58.950
the way up to 10 squared.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.600
And we could do that.

00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.290
Four squared is 16.

00:11:01.290 --> 00:11:03.270
Five squared is 25.

00:11:03.270 --> 00:11:08.250
36, 49, 64, 81, and 100.

00:11:08.250 --> 00:11:13.290
So the light bulbs with these
numbers on it are the ones

00:11:13.290 --> 00:11:15.670
that will stay lit when
they're all done.

00:11:15.670 --> 00:11:18.150
Anyway, hope you enjoyed that.
