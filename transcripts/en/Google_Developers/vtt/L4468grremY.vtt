LAURENCE MORONEY: Welcome
to the Googleplex.

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:04.910
This is an incredible place
with lots of great stuff being

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:07.680
worked on every single day.

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:09.660
Before I worked here,
I always wondered

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:11.960
what it'd be like to
come to the Googleplex,

00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:14.550
meet up with a Googler,
and have coffee with them,

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.020
and just chat about what
they do, how they do it,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.120
and why they do it.

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:20.020
And today we're going
to do exactly that.

00:00:22.814 --> 00:00:24.980
Hi everybody, and welcome
to this episode of "Coffee

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:25.510
with a Googler."

00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:27.420
Today we're outdoors
in these lovely gardens

00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:29.450
beside the coffee lab
on Google's campus.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:31.370
And I'm meeting with
Katherine Kuan who's

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:33.650
an application developer
extraordinaire who's done

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:35.280
some fabulous stuff at Google.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:36.270
And she's going to
tell us all about it.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:36.895
Hey, Katherine.

00:00:36.895 --> 00:00:37.640
How are you?

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:38.190
KATHERINE KUAN: Good, Laurence.

00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:38.550
How are you?

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:39.120
LAURENCE MORONEY: Doing good.

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.110
So tell us all about it.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:41.693
I hear you've built
a lot of cool apps

00:00:41.693 --> 00:00:43.910
that a lot of the viewers
have probably used already.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:44.250
KATHERINE KUAN: Sure.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.590
So I worked on the Android
apps team here at Google.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:46.860
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:48.485
KATHERINE KUAN: And
I've worked on apps

00:00:48.485 --> 00:00:51.100
like Google Play, Google
Keep, and the Contacts app.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.500
LAURENCE MORONEY: Google
Keep is one of my favorites.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.950
KATHERINE KUAN: Oh, really?

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.936
LAURENCE MORONEY: Nice, yes.

00:00:53.936 --> 00:00:54.850
KATHERINE KUAN: That's awesome.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:55.165
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:00:55.165 --> 00:00:56.800
So now you're
moving on from being

00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.164
a person who builds all
this wide diversity of apps

00:00:59.164 --> 00:01:01.580
to somebody who's helping new
developers learn about them.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:02.500
So tell us about that.

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:02.840
KATHERINE KUAN: Yeah.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:04.420
When I was on the
Android apps team,

00:01:04.420 --> 00:01:06.140
we had so many great
resources here.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:08.800
Really great engineers and
designers and product managers.

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.300
And they kind of helped me build
a good understanding of what it

00:01:12.300 --> 00:01:14.250
means to build a good product.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:16.690
And I wanted to share
that type of information

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:18.500
with people out in the public.

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:20.371
Because sometimes,
building for Android

00:01:20.371 --> 00:01:21.745
can be a little
bit intimidating.

00:01:21.745 --> 00:01:22.350
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes, it can.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:24.380
KATHERINE KUAN: There's so
many resources out there.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:25.963
And you just don't
know where to start

00:01:25.963 --> 00:01:27.130
or what's important or not.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:30.490
That's why I've been so excited
to work on these Udacity

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:31.070
courses.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.050
Because I feel
like it's a chance

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:36.470
to provide people with a
linear flow of how to start

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:37.490
building an Android app.

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.250
So we kind of guide
you along the path

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:42.510
of what are the
important components

00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:46.100
that you need in your app,
whether it is building a UI

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:48.300
or building a database,
or a content provider,

00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:49.880
or a sync adapter.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.690
We guide you through building
the Sunshine app, which

00:01:52.690 --> 00:01:55.200
is like a canonical
example app that

00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:57.960
has a list of data
and a detail page,

00:01:57.960 --> 00:01:59.927
and it also works
on tablets, as well.

00:01:59.927 --> 00:02:02.010
So we kind of teach all
these fundamental concepts

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:03.009
in a story, almost.

00:02:03.009 --> 00:02:05.300
LAURENCE MORONEY: So the
fundamentals course was great.

00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:06.240
I took it myself.

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.940
It was a great refresher.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.100
And I've done Java
on and off for years,

00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.870
but it was really good
to sit down and see

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.496
some of the great
Java techniques

00:02:13.496 --> 00:02:15.620
that you can use for building
Android applications.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:18.330
And actually, finally,
make sense out of them,

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.004
which is great.

00:02:19.004 --> 00:02:20.920
But I was wondering as
I was doing it, though,

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.934
what about somebody who
hasn't done Java before?

00:02:22.934 --> 00:02:25.100
Or somebody who is a newcomer
to mobile development?

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:26.941
How do we get them on
ramp so that then they

00:02:26.941 --> 00:02:29.440
can enjoy the goodness that was
in your fundamentals course?

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:30.815
KATHERINE KUAN:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:02:30.815 --> 00:02:32.300
So in Android
fundamentals course,

00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.050
we kind of breezed through
some of the concepts

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:39.860
like hitting a server or
using SQL for databases.

00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.480
And so we want to-- we're
creating a precursor

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:44.330
to Android fundamentals now.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:45.745
And this is a new course.

00:02:45.745 --> 00:02:47.120
It's called Intro
to Android now.

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.786
It might change.

00:02:47.786 --> 00:02:50.600
But essentially, we're taking
people from the beginning.

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:53.160
So someone who's never
written any lines of code,

00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:56.080
we're going to teach them
XML from the beginning.

00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.810
We're going to teach
them Java concepts,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:59.150
event-driven programming.

00:02:59.150 --> 00:03:01.355
And just create like a
couple of really simple apps,

00:03:01.355 --> 00:03:02.980
just to give people
the feeling of what

00:03:02.980 --> 00:03:05.652
it is like to create
something from scratch.

00:03:05.652 --> 00:03:06.610
LAURENCE MORONEY: Cool.

00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.190
And then they'll be
prepared to then go

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:10.689
into the really, really cool
stuff that's from fundamentals.

00:03:10.689 --> 00:03:12.820
KATHERINE KUAN: They have
to practice a little more

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:13.500
on their own.

00:03:13.500 --> 00:03:16.110
But hopefully they'll see
from this intro course

00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.720
whether this is right
for them or not.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:20.390
Because computer science can
have a lot of misconceptions

00:03:20.390 --> 00:03:21.070
to people.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:23.150
People think that developers
just sit in a corner

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.490
all by themselves working.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:28.400
Or that-- Yeah, exactly.

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:31.130
And so we want to show
people that building Android

00:03:31.130 --> 00:03:33.462
apps is really to help
improve other people's lives.

00:03:33.462 --> 00:03:35.670
LAURENCE MORONEY: I mean,
one of the things about how

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.934
Udacity courses work, and you're
building these through Udacity,

00:03:38.934 --> 00:03:40.350
they're a little
different, right?

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.099
It's not just like
you're sitting watching

00:03:42.099 --> 00:03:43.300
a video of somebody talking.

00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:44.940
There's a lot of
interaction involved.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.100
And there's a lot
of app building

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:47.140
that the person has to do.

00:03:47.140 --> 00:03:49.556
Could you explain a little bit
of the process behind that?

00:03:49.556 --> 00:03:52.810
KATHERINE KUAN: It's a series of
videos and interactive quizzes.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.880
So we are-- in the Android
fundamentals course,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.200
we're guiding them through
building a weather app.

00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:01.690
And so there will be videos of
me or my two co-instructors.

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:06.980
And we'll teach in a style that
we call just-in-time learning.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.970
So say they need to
build the list page.

00:04:09.970 --> 00:04:11.660
We'll build up parts
of it at a time

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.470
and then as concepts arise
that they don't know,

00:04:14.470 --> 00:04:17.376
we'll just do a short
lecture on that.

00:04:17.376 --> 00:04:18.750
And then to test
their knowledge,

00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:20.370
we'll have an interactive quiz.

00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:23.790
So you can-- it's a
multiple choice answer,

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:25.750
or maybe it's a
little coding task

00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:28.420
that they have to do on
the side in Android Studio.

00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:31.810
And then we reengage them and
then go to the next concept

00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:32.450
and so on.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:33.210
LAURENCE MORONEY: I see.

00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.543
And then you also make the
source code available, right?

00:04:35.543 --> 00:04:38.040
So if they do get stuck, they
can download the source code

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:38.800
for that section.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:40.010
And then they could
learn from that.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:41.360
So they're prepared
for the next section.

00:04:41.360 --> 00:04:41.810
KATHERINE KUAN: Yes.

00:04:41.810 --> 00:04:43.390
All the code is
available in GitHub.

00:04:43.390 --> 00:04:46.650
And we've split it up based
on this code checkpoints

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.280
parts of the course so that
people can follow along.

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:51.910
And another really great thing
that we've been rolling out

00:04:51.910 --> 00:04:54.810
recently is this thing called
Android Fundamentals Study

00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:55.310
Jams.

00:04:55.310 --> 00:04:56.226
LAURENCE MORONEY: Yes.

00:04:56.226 --> 00:04:56.970
I attended one.

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.500
KATHERINE KUAN: Oh, really?

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.380
LAURENCE MORONEY: I went to one
in Dublin a couple weeks ago.

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.020
KATHERINE KUAN: Oh, really?

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:00.730
How was it?

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:02.980
LAURENCE MORONEY: It was
actually really, really cool.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.521
I didn't realize
you were doing that.

00:05:04.521 --> 00:05:06.210
But I love the concept of it.

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:09.281
But explain it for everybody
hasn't been lucky to go to one

00:05:09.281 --> 00:05:09.780
like I have.

00:05:09.780 --> 00:05:10.613
KATHERINE KUAN: Yes.

00:05:10.613 --> 00:05:12.479
For the Android
Fundamentals Study Jams,

00:05:12.479 --> 00:05:15.020
basically we're partnering with
a lot of the Google Developer

00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:16.800
groups around the world.

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:19.020
And there's leaders in
each of these groups

00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:21.546
who have taken the Android
Fundamentals course

00:05:21.546 --> 00:05:23.920
or have already learned Android
development on their own.

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:26.050
And now they're
leading a classroom

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:29.770
of students who are going to
take the Udacity course online.

00:05:29.770 --> 00:05:31.700
But every week after
they finish one course,

00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:34.380
they come together and meet
and talk about problems

00:05:34.380 --> 00:05:36.420
that they had and work
through things together.

00:05:36.420 --> 00:05:38.800
And then by the end of
meeting maybe seven times

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.470
or so, they're going
to start working

00:05:40.470 --> 00:05:41.680
on their final projects.

00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:43.310
I think it's so
important for people

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.280
to not learn purely through
online, like at home.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:49.720
Because when you get stuck,
you don't know what to do.

00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:53.310
So I think that community aspect
and having these local leaders

00:05:53.310 --> 00:05:56.500
teach Android development
will really round out

00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:00.714
people's experience to help them
get ramped up on creating apps.

00:06:00.714 --> 00:06:02.130
LAURENCE MORONEY:
And I notice one

00:06:02.130 --> 00:06:03.838
the themes that you're
bringing up a lot,

00:06:03.838 --> 00:06:06.130
and what's important for
you personally, I can see,

00:06:06.130 --> 00:06:08.470
is how people learn is social.

00:06:08.470 --> 00:06:09.757
By having a social impact.

00:06:09.757 --> 00:06:11.840
So when learning is like
working with other people

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:13.520
rather than working
as an island.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.251
But also, I understand that
you have an encouragement

00:06:16.251 --> 00:06:17.750
for people who are
building the apps

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:20.160
that they have to
build as part of course

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:21.619
to do something social.

00:06:21.619 --> 00:06:22.910
Can you share a little of that?

00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:23.440
KATHERINE KUAN: Sure.

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:25.600
The power of mobile, I
think, is connecting people

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.930
to the right information
at the right time.

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:30.380
And so I feel like
a lot of challenges

00:06:30.380 --> 00:06:33.230
that we have in
society today, people

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:35.850
might not have access to
basic resources of life

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:37.492
like food, water, shelter.

00:06:37.492 --> 00:06:38.200
Things like that.

00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.450
But if we can use mobile
phones to connect them

00:06:40.450 --> 00:06:43.290
to that information, then they
can get access to those things.

00:06:43.290 --> 00:06:46.420
I think that blows my
mind, how powerful that is.

00:06:46.420 --> 00:06:49.580
And I really want
our developers to see

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:52.880
the power of what Android
can provide as a platform,

00:06:52.880 --> 00:06:55.250
but also to identify
those problems

00:06:55.250 --> 00:06:58.270
and kind of marry those together
to create a solution that

00:06:58.270 --> 00:06:59.187
works well for people.

00:06:59.187 --> 00:07:00.061
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:00.061 --> 00:07:01.580
So the Android
Fundamentals course

00:07:01.580 --> 00:07:03.590
is available now for
people to get started.

00:07:03.590 --> 00:07:08.170
And your upcoming course
to help newcomers ramp up

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:10.440
to get the skills for
that is coming soon.

00:07:10.440 --> 00:07:11.431
So sometime this year?

00:07:11.431 --> 00:07:12.264
KATHERINE KUAN: Yes.

00:07:12.264 --> 00:07:13.070
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK, cool.

00:07:13.070 --> 00:07:14.640
And it'll be available
on Udacity's course.

00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:16.660
And they're also available
free of charge, right?

00:07:16.660 --> 00:07:17.190
KATHERINE KUAN: Yes.

00:07:17.190 --> 00:07:17.710
LAURENCE MORONEY:
One of the things

00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.140
that people always ask about
with Udacity services--

00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.770
and I went to the Study Jam
and I got the question a lot,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:24.330
was that, is it really free?

00:07:24.330 --> 00:07:26.280
Because it just seems
to be a paid link.

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:27.350
Could you tell us
what's the difference?

00:07:27.350 --> 00:07:28.800
And what do they get for free?

00:07:28.800 --> 00:07:30.040
KATHERINE KUAN: For free,
you can access all the course

00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.123
materials that the other
co-instructors and I have

00:07:32.123 --> 00:07:34.930
created, like videos,
quizzes, and the code.

00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:36.900
And then if you want
additional help,

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:39.150
you can sign up for
the paid experience,

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.860
where you would get
one on one tutoring

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.230
with someone from Udacity.

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.881
And then you also get a verified
certificate at the end of it.

00:07:44.881 --> 00:07:47.130
So it really just depends
on what learning environment

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:47.990
is best for you.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:49.890
LAURENCE MORONEY: But anybody
who wants to learn the beginner

00:07:49.890 --> 00:07:51.610
stuff and wants to learn
the fundamental stuff,

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:52.930
they can learn it all,
they can build the apps

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.460
without paying a dime.

00:07:53.460 --> 00:07:54.240
KATHERINE KUAN: Absolutely.

00:07:54.240 --> 00:07:54.590
LAURENCE MORONEY: OK.

00:07:54.590 --> 00:07:55.204
Cool.

00:07:55.204 --> 00:07:56.620
Thanks, Katherine,
for being here.

00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.870
And thanks everybody
for watching this far.

00:07:58.870 --> 00:08:01.550
And if you want to learn
more about the courses

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:03.050
that Katherine has
been working on

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:04.980
and other courses for
Android, go take a look

00:08:04.980 --> 00:08:06.620
at the Udacity.com site.

00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.670
As Katherine explained,
it's totally free.

00:08:08.670 --> 00:08:10.480
The Fundamentals
course is really cool.

00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:12.532
And you can join about
200,000 other students

00:08:12.532 --> 00:08:13.240
who have done it.

00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:15.770
Or maybe even join a Study
Jam in your local area.

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:17.770
I attended the one in
Dublin a couple weeks ago,

00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.180
just the first
one, unfortunately.

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:20.346
And it was really wonderful.

00:08:20.346 --> 00:08:22.500
And I strongly recommend
everybody to do so.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.010
So with that, I just want
to thank very much Katherine

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:26.020
for being here today.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.370
KATHERINE KUAN:
Thank you, Laurence.

00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:27.740
LAURENCE MORONEY: I've
learned so much from you.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.340
Thank you so much.

00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:29.215
KATHERINE KUAN: Yeah.

00:08:29.215 --> 00:08:31.180
It was really great catching up.
