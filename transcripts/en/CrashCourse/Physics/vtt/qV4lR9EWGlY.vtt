00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:07.330
When you think about it, you probably receive
hundreds -- even thousands -- of cues about

00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:11.030
what’s going on in your environment every
day, strictly from sound.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.610
In addition to things like speech and music,
there are other bits of auditory information

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:19.410
that shape your day: an ambulance passing
by, a baby crying in the next room,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.820
and of course [cell-phone style text ding goes off]
--

00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:21.820
-- sorry.

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:22.820
Just got a text.

00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:26.180
But there’s a lot that we can learn, not
just from what these cues MEAN, but from how

00:00:26.180 --> 00:00:27.630
Sound itself works.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.000
Studying sound waves has helped doctors learn
more about our ears, and has allowed engineers

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.170
to design things like microphones and speakers.

00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:38.230
Biologists have even used the science of sound
to figure out how animals like elephants can

00:00:38.230 --> 00:00:41.850
communicate over long distances -- when we
can’t even hear them doing it.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:45.589
It all comes down to the fact that SOUND is
a wave, which travels through a medium like

00:00:45.589 --> 00:00:46.589
air or water.

00:00:46.589 --> 00:00:50.289
And knowing that sound is a wave is important,
because it means that we can use the physics

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:53.029
of waves to describe the qualities of sound.

00:00:53.029 --> 00:01:05.580
[Intro Music Plays]

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.990
When you think of a wave, you probably think
of the kind you see at the ocean, or the ones

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:11.250
you made when you jumped on that trampoline
last time.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:15.950
Those waves produce ripples that run perpendicular
to the direction, that the wave is traveling in.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.200
But sound is the other kind of wave: it’s
a longitudinal wave, meaning that the wave’s

00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:23.890
back-and-forth motion happens in the same direction in which the wave travels.

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:28.020
Say you get a text message on your phone,
and it makes a nice, bright little ‘ding!’ sound.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.640
What actually happened? Like, on a physical level?

00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.510
Your phone’s speaker contains a diaphragm
-- a piece of stiff material, usually in the

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:35.510
shape of a cone.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:39.140
When you got the message, the electronics
inside the speaker made the diaphragm move

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:41.960
back and forth, which vibrated the air around
your phone.

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.060
That made the atoms and molecules in the air
move back and forth.

00:01:45.060 --> 00:01:50.020
Then, those moving particles vibrated the
air around them -- and as the process continued,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.180
the sound wave spread outward.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.580
[ding!]

00:01:53.590 --> 00:01:55.170
Sorry! I’m just gonna turn this off now.

00:01:55.170 --> 00:01:59.680
Anyway, physicists sometimes describe sound
waves in terms of the movement of these particles

00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:02.700
in the air -- in what’s known as a displacement
wave.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:06.510
But by moving particles in the air, sound
waves also do something else:

00:02:06.510 --> 00:02:10.700
They cause the air to compress and expand
-- which is why sound waves are sometimes

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.099
described as ‘pressure waves’.

00:02:12.099 --> 00:02:16.430
As the wave spreads through the air, the particles
end up bunching together in some places, and

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:17.930
‘spreading out’ in others.

00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:21.969
Together, all that bunching and spreading-out
causes areas of high pressure and low pressure

00:02:21.969 --> 00:02:23.749
to form and move through the air.

00:02:23.749 --> 00:02:27.909
It’s useful to describe sound waves as pressure
waves, because we can build devices that detect

00:02:27.909 --> 00:02:29.060
those changes in pressure.

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:33.930
That’s how some microphones work, for example:
They use a diaphragm stretched over a sealed

00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:38.560
compartment, and as sound waves pass by, they
create areas of lower or higher pressure in

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:39.560
the compartment.

00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.730
The differences in pressure cause the diaphragm
to move back and forth, which electronics

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:45.560
then translate into audio data

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.170
And your eardrums basically work the same
way!

00:02:48.170 --> 00:02:51.620
As pressure waves pass through, they make
your eardrum vibrate.

00:02:51.620 --> 00:02:54.510
Your brain then interprets those vibrations
as sound.

00:02:54.510 --> 00:02:56.579
But not all sounds are the same.

00:02:56.580 --> 00:03:00.769
Even before we knew much about physics, humans
were describing sound in terms of certain qualities:

00:03:00.769 --> 00:03:02.909
mainly, by things like ‘loudness’
and ‘pitch’.

00:03:02.909 --> 00:03:06.939
Our understanding of those qualities helped
shape the development of music -- which we’ll

00:03:06.939 --> 00:03:08.010
talk more about next time.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.260
But there’s also a more physics-y side to
those qualities of music.

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:14.730
Pitch can be high or low, and it corresponds
to the ‘frequency’ of the wave.

00:03:14.730 --> 00:03:19.069
So, air that’s vibrating back and forth
more times per second will have a higher pitch,

00:03:19.069 --> 00:03:22.749
and air that’s vibrating fewer times per
second will have a lower pitch.

00:03:22.749 --> 00:03:26.579
Humans hear sounds best when the vibrations
are somewhere between 20 per second on the

00:03:26.579 --> 00:03:30.010
low end and 20,000 per second on the high
end.

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.290
As we get older and lose more of the cells
that help us detect sound, we start to lose

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:36.739
the ability to hear higher-pitched sounds.

00:03:36.739 --> 00:03:40.590
Some building security companies will take
advantage of this, using devices that emit

00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:45.120
a high-pitched noise that most people over
the age of 25 can’t hear.

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:49.269
The idea is that since kids and teens can
hear it, and it’s super annoying to them,

00:03:49.269 --> 00:03:51.000
they won’t hang out near the building.

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.680
But some sounds are too high or low for any
humans to hear.

00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:59.162
Sounds that are too high in pitch are called
ultrasonic, and sounds that are too low are

00:03:59.162 --> 00:04:00.340
called infrasonic.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:05.319
Dog whistles, for example, use an ultrasonic
pitch that’s too high for us, but is perfectly

00:04:05.319 --> 00:04:06.319
audible to dogs.

00:04:06.319 --> 00:04:10.019
Elephants, on the other hand, use INFRAsonic
sound to communicate with each other across

00:04:10.019 --> 00:04:11.209
long distances.

00:04:11.209 --> 00:04:15.120
They can hear these calls from several kilometers
away, but we can’t hear them at all.

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:20.070
Another aspect that shapes sound is its loudness
-- when you increase the intensity of a sound,

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.959
you increase its loudness, and vice versa.

00:04:21.959 --> 00:04:26.419
We’ve talked about the intensity of a wave
before: it’s the wave’s power over its

00:04:26.419 --> 00:04:28.490
area, measured in Watts per square meter.

00:04:28.490 --> 00:04:33.070
We’ve also said that the intensity of a
wave is proportional to the wave’s amplitude, squared.

00:04:33.070 --> 00:04:36.379
And the farther you are from the source of
a wave, the lower its intensity -- by the

00:04:36.379 --> 00:04:39.039
square of the distance between you and the
source.

00:04:39.039 --> 00:04:42.879
And just as there’s a range of pitches that
humans can hear, there’s also a range of

00:04:42.879 --> 00:04:46.129
sound wave intensity that humans can comfortably
hear.

00:04:46.129 --> 00:04:50.120
Generally, people can safely hear sounds from
about 1 picowatt per square meter,

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:54.900
up to 1 Watt per square meter -- which is about as loud as a rock concert, if you’re near the speakers.

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:59.030
The sound waves coming from a jet plane that’s
30 meters away, for example, probably has

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:01.449
an intensity of around 100 Watts per square
meter.

00:05:01.449 --> 00:05:04.450
Now, I don’t know if you’ve ever been
that close to a roaring jet plane.

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:09.210
But there’s a reason people who work on
the tarmac at airports use those heavy-duty headphones.

00:05:09.210 --> 00:05:13.840
Below 1 picowatt per square meter, sounds
are just too soft for us to detect them.

00:05:13.849 --> 00:05:17.840
And although we will HEAR sounds above a Watt
per square meter, they tend to hurt our ears.

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:22.650
But here’s a weird thing about loudness
and intensity: it’s not a linear relationship.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:27.460
Generally, a sound wave needs to have ten
times the intensity to sound twice as loud to us.

00:05:27.460 --> 00:05:31.360
This relationship holds true as long as the
sound is toward the middle of the range of

00:05:31.370 --> 00:05:32.860
frequencies we can hear.

00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:37.160
So, instead of directly measuring the loudness
of sounds by their intensity, we use units

00:05:37.160 --> 00:05:39.430
called ‘decibels’ -- which are based on
bels.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:43.850
Bels convert a sound wave’s intensity to
a ‘logarithmic scale’, where every notch

00:05:43.850 --> 00:05:46.660
on the scale is ten times higher than the
previous one.

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:50.909
The scale starts off with an intensity of
1 picowatt per square meter, corresponding

00:05:50.909 --> 00:05:52.409
to 0 bels.

00:05:52.409 --> 00:05:56.530
So a sound that’s 1 bel is ten times as
intense as a sound that’s 0 bels.

00:05:56.530 --> 00:06:01.379
And a sound that’s 2 bels is 10 times as
intense as a sound that’s 1 bel --

00:06:01.379 --> 00:06:05.360
-- but 100 times as intense as a sound that’s
0 bels.

00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:08.310
Measuring everything in bels can be kind of
annoying, because sometimes you want to talk

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:12.900
about sounds that are, say, 3.4 bels without
having to deal with decimal points.

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:16.440
That’s why most of the time, you’ll hear
the loudness of a sound described using the

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.580
more familiar decibel unit -- a tenth of a
bel.

00:06:19.580 --> 00:06:24.180
To find the loudness of a sound when you know
its intensity, you take the base-10 logarithm

00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:28.860
of its intensity, over the reference intensity
of 1 picowatt per square meter.

00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.470
Then, you multiply that number by 10 to get
the sound’s decibel level.

00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:36.599
We can use this equation to convert the intensity
of that noisy rock concert -- which we said

00:06:36.599 --> 00:06:38.810
was 1 Watt per square meter -- to decibels.

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.290
First, we take the base 10 log of 1 Watt per
square meter, over 1 picowatt per square meter.

00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:49.900
Now, 1 divided by 1 x 10^-12 is just 1 x 10^12.

00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:56.030
So what we really want to do is take the base
10 log of 1 x 10^12 -- or a trillion -- watts

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:57.030
per square meter.

00:06:57.030 --> 00:07:01.169
What a logarithm asks you to do, is find the
power that you would need to raise the base

00:07:01.169 --> 00:07:03.300
to in order to get the number in parentheses.

00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:08.979
In other words, we’re looking for the exponent
of 10 that would equal 1 x 10^12.

00:07:08.979 --> 00:07:10.259
Which is just 12.

00:07:10.259 --> 00:07:15.220
To finish off the calculation of decibels
from intensity, we multiply that value -- 12

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:20.980
-- by 10 to get the decibel level of the rock
concert, where you were standing: 120 decibels.

00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:21.620
Ouch.

00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.889
You’ll notice that as the source of a sound
moves closer to you, it gets louder, and as

00:07:25.889 --> 00:07:27.909
it moves away, it gets softer.

00:07:27.909 --> 00:07:31.360
That makes sense, since the closer you are
to the source of a sound, the greater the

00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.319
intensity of the wave that hits your ear.

00:07:33.319 --> 00:07:36.490
But have you ever noticed that the pitch of
the sound changes, too?

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:40.419
It’s called the ‘Doppler effect’: As
a source of sound moves toward you, the pitch

00:07:40.419 --> 00:07:42.689
of the sound you hear increases.

00:07:42.689 --> 00:07:45.529
And as the source moves away, the pitch decreases.

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:49.280
To see why, imagine you’re standing on the
sidewalk, when suddenly you hear an ambulance

00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.560
siren start up.

00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:53.830
It’s coming from down the road, and it seems
to be moving toward you.

00:07:53.830 --> 00:07:58.770
The ambulance is continuously emitting sound
waves at a certain frequency, in the form

00:07:58.770 --> 00:07:59.770
of that siren.

00:07:59.770 --> 00:08:04.990
But as the ambulance moves toward you, the
ambulance is also driving toward those sound waves.

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:09.480
So, the peaks that hit your eardrums are closer
together -- even though they’re moving at

00:08:09.490 --> 00:08:12.819
the same speed -- and you get hit by them
more often.

00:08:12.819 --> 00:08:14.790
Which means you hear a higher-pitched sound.

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:19.530
At the same time, it keeps emitting more sound,
which adds more peaks to those earlier sound

00:08:19.530 --> 00:08:20.879
waves that are heading your way.

00:08:20.879 --> 00:08:24.440
What you end up with, is a sound wave with
a higher frequency than before.

00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.469
That’s what hits your eardrum, so you hear
a sound that’s higher in pitch than the

00:08:28.469 --> 00:08:30.879
one you heard before the ambulance started
moving.

00:08:30.879 --> 00:08:35.719
As the ambulance passes you and starts to
drive away down the road, the opposite happens.

00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:39.960
The sound waves are still coming toward you,
but the ambulance is driving away from them.

00:08:39.969 --> 00:08:44.649
So the peaks that hit your eardrum are farther
apart, and you hear a sound with a lower pitch.

00:08:44.649 --> 00:08:48.700
The Doppler effect isn’t unique to sound
waves, though -- it happens with light, too.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:53.780
Which means we can actually use it to measure
the distance of stars -- but more on that much later.

00:08:53.790 --> 00:08:56.760
For now, you learned about sound waves, and
how they move particles back and forth to

00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.250
create differences in pressure.

00:08:58.250 --> 00:09:04.540
We also talked about pitch, and how the intensity
of a sound wave changes with amplitude and distance.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.089
Finally, we covered decibels, as well as the
Doppler effect.
