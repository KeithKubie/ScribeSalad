00:00:00.012 --> 00:00:03.311
That was all great work. You now know how to plot points in a Cartesian

00:00:03.311 --> 00:00:07.094
coordiante system. You can look at lines and identify x and y intercepts. And

00:00:07.094 --> 00:00:10.970
you can calculate intercepts from an equation which is really just a description

00:00:10.970 --> 00:00:14.616
of a line. And in the next section we will investigate lines and equations in

00:00:14.616 --> 00:00:18.455
more detail. We'll look at slope and figure out what that word actually means.

00:00:18.456 --> 00:00:21.970
Try some practice on this, and then stay with me to see what's next.
