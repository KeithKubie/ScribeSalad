00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Well, in the global environment x is 1 and y is 2.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
When we call myfun, the rules from before say that

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.000
we should make storage spaces for all of the formal parameters: a, b, and x.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Here's b, here's x, so this must be a.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
We fill them in with the values of the actual arguments.

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:23.000
A was 1 plus 2, that's 3. Great, that was already done.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
B is 3 plus 4. This evaluates to 7, so b is 7,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000
and x was 5 plus 6, so that's 11.

00:00:32.000 --> 09:59:59.000
So, at the end of the day, this is going to print out 21.
