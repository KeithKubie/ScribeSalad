00:00:00.229 --> 00:00:13.580
How 
the Dalai Lama is Chosen

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:21.279
Have you ever wondered how the Dalai Lama
becomes the Dalai Lama?

00:00:21.279 --> 00:00:22.550
Well, wonder no more.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:26.390
For starters, it should be noted that the
Dalai Lama is not technically considered to

00:00:26.390 --> 00:00:29.060
be chosen; rather, he is found.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.289
But to understand how it works, you first
have to learn the basics of Tibetan Buddhism

00:00:33.289 --> 00:00:35.270
and its belief in reincarnation.

00:00:35.270 --> 00:00:40.430
A unique variant of Buddhism, the Tibetan
form draws on ancient Tibetan Bon and the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.550
Mahayana tradition, as well as its Vajrayana
path.

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.720
Incorporating meditation, yoga and tantric
disciplines, Tibetan Buddhists avoid philosophical

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.280
speculation, preferring practice as a means
to attain realization and ultimately Buddhahood;

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.070
upon reaching perfect enlightenment, he who
attains Buddhahood can choose to stop the

00:00:58.070 --> 00:01:01.980
cycle of life, suffering, death and reincarnation.

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.050
Based upon the idea that the human mind is
the source of all things, Tibetan Buddhists

00:01:06.050 --> 00:01:10.360
believe that everything that is experienced
really only happens inside your head.

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.180
In order to reach ultimate enlightenment through
the mind, however, people must gain control

00:01:14.180 --> 00:01:19.060
over the essential energy that animates all
existence, prana; the primary way to tame

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:21.510
that tiger is by controlling the mind.

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:25.780
Adherents, therefore, take two courses on
their journey to perfect enlightenment, the

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:27.511
Path of Means and the Path of Liberation.

00:01:27.511 --> 00:01:33.190
The first path involves a fair amount of prayers
and obeisances to the Buddhas, the student’s

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:38.660
teacher and in repentance (300,000 total);
in addition, those on the Path of Means recite

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.880
mantras, practice pranayama (yogic breathing),
cultivate altruistic thought and ultimately

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:48.210
train to achieve complete enlightenment to
share with all sentient beings.

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.760
No small task.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:53.730
The second path, of liberation, sounds simple,
but is supremely difficult.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.770
The student must learn to effortlessly enter
and remain in a state of deep relaxation.

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:03.170
Students seek this state to become one with
the primordial cosmic mind, again through

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:04.170
mediation.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:09.759
Ultimately, when one reaches the perfectly
relaxed state, the two paths converge; eventually,

00:02:09.759 --> 00:02:12.030
complete enlightenment can be reached.

00:02:12.030 --> 00:02:16.280
Those who attain this state, but seek to return
lifetime after lifetime out of their compassion

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:21.170
for, and desire to benefit, all sentient beings,
are called Bodhisattvas.

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:25.799
Although all variants of Buddhism have some
concept of rebirth, the Tibetans have created

00:02:25.799 --> 00:02:27.790
a whole study of the subject.

00:02:27.790 --> 00:02:32.109
In The Tibetan Book of the Dead, the unique
Tibetan idea that a person is not immediately

00:02:32.109 --> 00:02:37.989
reincarnated after death, but that an intermediate
period exists, called the bardo, is described

00:02:37.989 --> 00:02:39.150
and explained.

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:43.670
In this interval, the soul passes through
three stages, also called bardos.

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:48.239
The first, chikkhai bardo, has the soul at
the moment of death experiencing the “clear

00:02:48.239 --> 00:02:49.239
light of reality.”

00:02:49.239 --> 00:02:53.790
Chonyid bardo, the second stage, is where
the soul sees different Buddha forms.

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:57.430
In the third stage, sidpa bardo, the soul
is reborn.

00:02:57.430 --> 00:03:02.310
According to Tibetan Buddhists, when ordinary
people die, they exercise little control over

00:03:02.310 --> 00:03:06.010
their own reincarnation, since that is governed
by their karma.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:11.000
An individual’s karma is created by the
motivations behind his actions taken over

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.159
each of his previous lives, with each action
creating a seed that grows to fruition in

00:03:16.159 --> 00:03:17.459
later lives.

00:03:17.459 --> 00:03:21.150
This means that, if you did something bad,
or even if you did something good for all

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:24.489
the wrong reasons, you’ll pay for it in
a later life.

00:03:24.489 --> 00:03:29.060
However, there exist an enlightened few that
have transcended the sway of karma through

00:03:29.060 --> 00:03:32.750
their devotion to complete compassion for
all sentient beings.

00:03:32.750 --> 00:03:38.249
Among these enlightened are a number of superior
Bodhisattvas, called tulkus, who control the

00:03:38.249 --> 00:03:40.810
time and place of their future births.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:44.420
The most well known tulku in the world is
the Dalai Lama.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.349
This brings us to how they go about finding
the Dalai Lama.

00:03:47.349 --> 00:03:52.220
As a supremely enlightened being, when a Dalai
Lama shuffles off his mortal coil, he doesn’t

00:03:52.220 --> 00:03:55.299
just expire, he practices conscious dying.

00:03:55.299 --> 00:04:00.239
Called phowa, the process involves the transference
of the consciousness, just at the time of

00:04:00.239 --> 00:04:05.489
death, into one of the Buddha forms, thus
avoiding the bardo and reincarnating by choice.

00:04:05.489 --> 00:04:10.599
Back on Earth, a committee of sorts comprised
of High Lamas and Tibetan governmental officials

00:04:10.599 --> 00:04:15.840
begin the search for the reincarnated tulku
by consulting the Nechung Oracle, the official

00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.380
seer of Tibet.

00:04:17.380 --> 00:04:21.820
In the past, the High Lamas next traveled
to Lhamo Lhatso, made sacred to the Dalai

00:04:21.820 --> 00:04:27.140
Lamas by the promise of a spirit who resided
there, Palden Lhamo, to protect their reincarnation.

00:04:27.140 --> 00:04:31.690
There, the High Lamas meditated beside the
lake and experienced visions and dreams that

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:33.190
guided their search.

00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:38.540
If the Dalai Lama had been cremated, the direction
the smoke blew was also noted with great interest.

00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.830
Typically, it takes two to three years to
find the reincarnated Dalai Lama, although

00:04:42.830 --> 00:04:45.920
with the latest, the 14th, it took four.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.960
When the High Lamas believed they had found
the reincarnated Dalai Lama, they conducted

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:51.060
a simple test.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:55.070
Several articles, only some of which were
owned by the previous Dalai Lama, are placed

00:04:55.070 --> 00:04:56.590
in front of the child.

00:04:56.590 --> 00:05:01.010
If he chooses the correct items, this is read
as a sign, along with the previous signs and

00:05:01.010 --> 00:05:04.640
some set of secret signs, that he is the tulku.

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:09.040
Next, three of the former Dalai Lama’s servants
who knew him well are asked to confirm the

00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:13.160
child’s identity; other officials are also
required to sign off on it, too.

00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:17.150
If more than one boy is identified in this
manner and a clear choice cannot be made,

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:20.850
the names are placed in a vase, and the name
drawn out is that of the person that will

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:22.900
become the next Dalai Lama.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:26.960
Upon formal confirmation, the Dalai Lama is
traditionally taken with his family to the

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.190
Drepung Monastery in Lhasa to begin his studies.

00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:34.690
Except for the 4th Dalai Lama, who was born
in Mongolia, the Dalai Lamas were all born

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:35.690
in Tibet.

00:05:35.690 --> 00:05:39.640
If should be noted that the procedures for
finding and identifying the Dalai Lama can

00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:45.210
be changed if approximately two-thirds of
the Tibetan people decide they need changed.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:50.750
Of course, the Chinese invaded Tibet in 1949,
and since 1959, when the Tibetan’s national

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:56.210
uprising was brutally suppressed, Tenzin Gyatso,
the current Dalai Lama, has been in exile.

00:05:56.210 --> 00:06:00.630
He is quoted as saying that he will not reincarnate
in a body that would reside in a country that

00:06:00.630 --> 00:06:05.370
is not free, and that no legitimacy should
be given to a person chosen for political

00:06:05.370 --> 00:06:09.130
purposes, particularly by officials from the
People’s Republic of China.

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:13.360
This has led to speculation that the next
Dalai Lama may be born in Nepal, Bhutan or

00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:17.060
India, countries with somewhat similar cultures
to Tibet.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:20.920
In fact, he has even questioned whether he
should continue as a tulku (i.e. reincarnate).

00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:25.540
Closer to his death, he intends to convene
a group of Buddhist scholars and consult with

00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:27.500
them prior to making that decision.

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:32.230
If he does choose to reincarnate, he opined
in 1991 that he “might take rebirth as an

00:06:32.230 --> 00:06:36.600
insect or an animal – whatever would be
of the most value to the largest number of

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.400
sentient beings.”

00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:41.210
Bonus Facts:
• The title “Dalai Lama”, literally

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:42.900
means “The Ocean Lama”.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:46.890
The “lama” part comes from the Tibetan
“blama”, which means “chief” or “high

00:06:46.890 --> 00:06:47.890
priest”.

00:06:47.890 --> 00:06:50.130
The “Dalai” part comes from Mongolian
for “Gyatso”.

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:53.590
Essentially, the Dalai Lama is an “ocean
of compassion/wisdom”.

00:06:53.590 --> 00:06:59.500
The title was first given to the third Dalai
Lama, Sonam Gyatso, by Altan Khan.

00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:04.230
In order to help secure his rule in Mongolia,
Altan Khan invited and later agreed to let

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:07.360
Sonam Gyatso convert Mongolia to Buddhism.

00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.910
Gyatso then proclaimed that Altan Khan was
in fact the reincarnated of the great Khublai

00:07:12.910 --> 00:07:18.710
Khan, former ruler of China and Mongolia and
grandson of Ghengis Khan, thus helping legitimize

00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:21.669
Altan Khan’s rule.

00:07:21.669 --> 00:07:26.110
• The fourth Dalai Lama, Yonten Gyatso,
the only to be born outside of Tibet to date,

00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:30.150
was the great grandson of Altan Khan.

00:07:30.150 --> 00:07:33.860
• The first Dalai Lama was not found in
his lifetime, but rather was considered such

00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:34.860
after his death.

00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:40.690
The man was known as Gendun Drup, a shepherd
turned monk/philosopher, who died in 1474.

00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:45.260
The second Dalai Lama, or as Buddhists believe,
the reincarnation of the first, was Gendun

00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:46.390
Gyatso.

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:50.650
The signs that he was the reincarnation of
Gendun Drup include that he as a boy supposedly

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:55.510
told his parents that he was Pema Dorje, which
was the birth name of Gendun Drup.

00:07:55.510 --> 00:07:59.240
His father also claimed that before the child’s
birth, he had a vision of a being telling

00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.860
him to name his child Gendun Drup, but he
chose not to, giving him the birth name Sangye

00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:16.479
Phel.
