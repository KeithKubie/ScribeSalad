00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:02.170
Ionizing radiation is like cupcakes.

00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:03.260
One cupcake, that's fine.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:05.799
1000 cupcakes, all at once?

00:00:05.799 --> 00:00:06.799
Not fine!

00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:11.160
You’ve probably seen acute radiation poisoning
on TV, people wrapped in bandages, and such…

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:14.730
but chances are you don’t know what’s
going on there… so let’s shed some visible

00:00:14.730 --> 00:00:17.020
light radiation on this mystery.

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:18.750
There are a few kinds of radiation.

00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:24.420
Some is light or heat, but the kind that damages
tissue is called ionizing radiation.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:28.680
Ionizing radiation comes in high-energy waves
like x-rays and gamma rays, or from nuclear

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:30.730
material via particle decay.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:35.660
This kind of radiation can damage atoms, which
can affect whole molecules (like DNA), and

00:00:35.660 --> 00:00:39.140
that can affect your cells, organs and whole
body.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:45.130
For example: your cells are comprised of water,
H2O; which, if broken apart by radiation can

00:00:45.130 --> 00:00:51.469
reform as O2 or H2 or H2O2 -- hydrogen peroxide!

00:00:51.469 --> 00:00:52.469
Not great.

00:00:52.469 --> 00:00:54.469
Of course, this all depends on dosage.

00:00:54.469 --> 00:00:57.579
Theoretically, ionizing radiation has no safe
dosage.

00:00:57.579 --> 00:01:01.930
When you get a dose of radiation, specialists
use Sieverts to calculate how much they used,

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:05.740
and Gray for the actual absorption of radiation
into tissue.

00:01:05.740 --> 00:01:11.799
A dental or stomach x-ray might be like 8
milliGrays (i.e. not many) or 8 milliSieverts.

00:01:11.799 --> 00:01:16.750
Repeated, low-level exposure (like tanning,
or working near nuclear material) can cause

00:01:16.750 --> 00:01:22.960
cancer, but when lots of ionizing radiation
hits you at once… it causes acute radiation

00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:23.960
poisoning.

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:25.100
That is serious.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:26.750
And it comes in four phases…

00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:28.210
First, prodromal.

00:01:28.210 --> 00:01:32.900
This can cause vomiting, nausea, diarrhea,
anorexia… and more radiation makes it worse.

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:40.040
It can hit you a few minutes or days later
. Second, is the latent phase.

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.920
You’d feel better, like you got over the
flu symptoms!

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:44.970
But… you didn’t.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:48.020
If you’ve had lab tests, they’d show you’re
poisoned by radiation.

00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:55.840
Then, maybe weeks later, BAM, the Manifest
illness phase.

00:01:55.840 --> 00:01:58.580
And four: recovery or death.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.840
If it’s a low dosage you can probably recover,
though you might have a higher risk of cancer.

00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.710
However, above a certain point, the poop emoji
hits the fan.

00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:13.079
Say someone was exposed to the equivalent
of 125 abdomen x-rays all at once.

00:02:13.079 --> 00:02:16.219
Then they’d hit the lowest level of poisoning.

00:02:16.219 --> 00:02:21.269
From one to ten gray the radiation penetrates
tissue, and kills bone marrow cells by damaging

00:02:21.269 --> 00:02:22.510
their DNA.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:27.040
No marrow means no replacement white blood
cells in case of infection, no new red blood

00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.760
cells, and no new platelets in case of injury.

00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:30.760
All bad.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:33.860
It can cause death from infection or blood
loss.

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:38.829
If your bone marrow is destroyed, you could
get a bone marrow transplant… but even that

00:02:38.829 --> 00:02:41.059
only gives a 50/50 chance.

00:02:41.059 --> 00:02:46.989
At more than 10 gray (at least 1250 x-rays
at once) cells in the gastrointestinal tract

00:02:46.989 --> 00:02:53.180
are killed, meaning the body can’t absorb
nutrients causing electrolyte imbalance, dehydration

00:02:53.180 --> 00:02:57.749
and worse… once the GI tract shuts down,
nothing can be done.

00:02:57.749 --> 00:02:59.010
Death is certain.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:05.469
Over 20 gray (2500 x-rays, at once!) -- it’s
not clear what happens, but doctors think

00:03:05.469 --> 00:03:10.480
your cardiovascular system and central nervous
system swell with fluid thanks to the damaged

00:03:10.480 --> 00:03:11.480
cells.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:16.739
In less than three days the brain can’t
control the body, and that’s all she wrote.

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:22.049
Because radiation is damaging DNA at the atomic
level acute poisoning is hard to treat.

00:03:22.049 --> 00:03:26.291
Radaway doesn’t exist, but there are treatments
for some of the symptoms... for example: if

00:03:26.291 --> 00:03:30.370
you get an infection because your white blood
cells are compromised -- doctors can treat

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:31.370
it.

00:03:31.370 --> 00:03:33.819
Same with the nausea, burns, and dehydration.

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:37.949
We know a lot of this because of the disaster
at Chernobyl, and because of the bombs dropped

00:03:37.949 --> 00:03:40.049
on Japan to end World War II.

00:03:40.049 --> 00:03:44.140
Scientists entered the area, studying the
sick, and documenting everything they could.

00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:46.790
But there’s still a lot we don’t know!

00:03:46.790 --> 00:03:51.080
I mean, as scary as radiation can be, most
of us will never get exposed to the dosages

00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.300
required to have to know all this stuff.

00:03:53.440 --> 00:03:56.460
But it’s still nice to know, right?

your body, but what is nuclear fallout exactly?

00:04:19.729 --> 00:04:22.030
