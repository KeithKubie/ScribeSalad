00:00:04.459 --> 00:00:06.000
PROFESSOR JOEL
SCHINDALL: This course

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.790
represents one of
four courses that

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.030
are given in the Gordon
Leadership Program.

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:14.570
We have a course on engineering
innovation and design,

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.990
a course on engineering
leadership, a course on people

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:21.080
and organizations, which talks
about how to work effectively

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.400
within a company, and of
course on project engineering,

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.480
which teaches them how to use
the same tools and skills they

00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.930
learned when they assemble
electronic systems to assemble

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:36.990
the management system
that it takes in order

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.900
to run a complicated program.

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.260
When we got funding for
the Gordon MIT Engineering

00:00:42.260 --> 00:00:44.410
Leadership Program,
we got together

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:46.830
with a number of
industry leaders,

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:49.270
actually quite a large
number of industry leaders,

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:51.700
to look at what was
engineering leadership

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.900
and what were they looking for
in the successful engineers

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.430
within their companies.

00:00:56.430 --> 00:01:00.190
About 3/4 of the topics
had to do with leadership--

00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:04.660
decision-making, advocacy,
cross-cultural communication--

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:06.410
but about a quarter
of the topics

00:01:06.410 --> 00:01:08.200
that they really
were looking for had

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:10.760
to do with good
engineering designers.

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:12.970
And they were talking
not just about being

00:01:12.970 --> 00:01:15.500
skilled in the
craft, but actually

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.550
looking at the world in a
way where they realized what

00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:20.590
was wanted and
needed, what was it

00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:24.060
the people who are using
this product might require,

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:30.110
and they actually came up with
elegant, innovative designs.

00:01:30.110 --> 00:01:32.460
They observed that
a small portion

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:35.720
of the engineers that they hired
seemed to have that ability,

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:37.540
and a much larger
portion of them

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:41.320
would do competent
design work, but just

00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.225
didn't pick up on the kinds
of breakthrough designs

00:01:45.225 --> 00:01:48.140
that the smaller group could do.

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.280
Rather than teach the
students the design skills

00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.750
of a particular
engineering discipline,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:58.130
we work to teach the students
to think like designers--

00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:00.320
to be able to get
outside the problem

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.310
itself and look at what is
the purpose of this project

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:05.960
or product or process?

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:07.690
What function does it serve?

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:10.460
What is the need that is
required out in the world?

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:14.950
And how can I innovatively
and creatively use the tools

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:18.860
that I have learned
in order to design,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.190
invent, produce, and
implement something

00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:25.620
that will satisfy this need?

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:27.470
So we put together
a course which

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:32.890
is a combination of
10 design principles,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:36.370
Socratic inquiry, and the
students themselves being

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:39.220
engaged in design
projects, and supported

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.080
by some student
teaching assistants,

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:44.920
which engages and
provokes the students

00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:47.320
to develop these
kinds of abilities

00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:50.030
and causes them to
leave the course not so

00:02:50.030 --> 00:02:52.350
much with a specific
body of knowledge--

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:55.670
we don't actually care
whether they continue

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:59.060
doing that specific
design project--

00:02:59.060 --> 00:03:03.020
but what we want them to do--
and they do, in fact, they

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:07.250
can't avoid it-- is to apply
this way of thinking to the way

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:10.320
that they go about
solving future problems.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.230
I actually had a
career in industry

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:15.440
after graduating
from MIT, 35 years

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:17.790
in aerospace and
telecommunications,

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:19.650
but I couldn't resist
the opportunity

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:22.780
to come back and
give back by helping

00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:30.300
MIT's young students develop the
kind of attitude and behavior

00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:35.120
that is necessary to be
effective as an engineer today.

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:44.500
PROFESSOR BLADE KOTELLY: We're
successful if a student exits

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.530
the course having
completely changed

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:48.120
the way they think
about the world.

00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.450
And I know that sounds
like a strange thing.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:52.910
And what we mean, is
that hopefully they

00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:54.110
see everything differently.

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:55.780
When they're walking
down the street

00:03:55.780 --> 00:03:58.522
and they pass a door
handle, they think,

00:03:58.522 --> 00:04:00.230
why is the door handle
designed that way?

00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.991
Does it communicate effectively
to me to know how to use it?

00:04:02.991 --> 00:04:03.990
What about other people?

00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.490
Would they understand
how to use it?

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.740
What's the material made
of, which material's

00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:09.540
involved in that door handle?

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:10.910
How has it been used?

00:04:10.910 --> 00:04:11.890
Is it smudged?

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:12.550
Is it clear?

00:04:12.550 --> 00:04:14.090
Is it clear against
the background?

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:16.190
Hopefully, they see
everything differently

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:20.430
in the vast interconnectedness
of everything in the world.

00:04:20.430 --> 00:04:22.150
And the fact that
everything we do

00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:23.780
is ultimately in
service to people.

00:04:23.780 --> 00:04:26.390
So if you're making a
part for space station,

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:29.540
it might have to be replaced
by someone or diagnosed,

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:32.220
so that is in service to people.

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:33.840
People to operate
a bigger system

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:36.280
that can tell us more
about how we live.

00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:40.380
So if they walk out of the
class being able to do that,

00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:41.089
we're successful.

00:04:41.089 --> 00:04:42.463
PROFESSOR JOEL
SCHINDALL: One way

00:04:42.463 --> 00:04:44.390
in which I like to
challenge the students

00:04:44.390 --> 00:04:47.420
at the end of the course
is to point out to them

00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:49.850
that the course
is not ending now.

00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:51.310
It's beginning now.

00:04:51.310 --> 00:04:53.550
We actually gave them
the instruction set

00:04:53.550 --> 00:04:54.880
and the way of thinking.

00:04:54.880 --> 00:04:57.460
Their job now is to
go out into the world

00:04:57.460 --> 00:04:59.580
and to use that
thinking in order

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.490
to be more effective designers.

00:05:01.490 --> 00:05:03.480
And here's a gotcha.

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:07.320
Once your eyes are open to that,
as has happened in this class,

00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:09.620
you can't stop doing it.

00:05:09.620 --> 00:05:13.430
So a year from now, or two
years from now, or five years

00:05:13.430 --> 00:05:16.330
from now, I expect
to hear back from you

00:05:16.330 --> 00:05:19.590
that you faced or
came up with some kind

00:05:19.590 --> 00:05:22.810
of a creative solution to
a longstanding problem.

00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:26.330
And I'm going to take great
satisfaction in the fact

00:05:26.330 --> 00:05:28.450
that you came up
with that solution,

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.630
but some of the tools and the
ways of looking at the world

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:33.710
that we discussed
in this class will

00:05:33.710 --> 00:05:37.360
have been the enabling or
the facilitating factor

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:40.880
in your effectiveness
of doing that.
