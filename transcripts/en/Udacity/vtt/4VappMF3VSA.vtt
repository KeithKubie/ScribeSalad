00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.507
In the U.S. and on the Internet

00:00:01.507 --> 00:00:03.523
there has been a lot of talk about this question.

00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:05.719
Why can't we open windows on a plane

00:00:05.719 --> 00:00:08.153
and most of the discussion I've seen on this topic

00:00:08.153 --> 00:00:10.401
has been completely unproductive.

00:00:10.401 --> 00:00:12.449
People seem to be ignoring the fact that

00:00:12.449 --> 00:00:14.487
this is an excellent question.

00:00:14.487 --> 00:00:17.296
So, let's figure it out, why can't

00:00:17.296 --> 00:00:19.398
we open windows on a plane.

00:00:19.398 --> 00:00:21.398
Well the fundamental principle that works here

00:00:21.398 --> 00:00:23.753
is the same principle that allows me to

00:00:23.753 --> 00:00:25.474
drink water out of a straw.

00:00:25.474 --> 00:00:27.744
It's the same phenomenon that causes your ears

00:00:27.744 --> 00:00:30.616
to hurt, if you go too deep underwater too quickly

00:00:30.616 --> 00:00:33.341
and what is this concept, it's this concept

00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:35.267
called pressure. And we're specifically going to

00:00:35.267 --> 00:00:38.580
talk about today is air pressure. So before we

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:41.736
get right into air pressure let's talk about air.
