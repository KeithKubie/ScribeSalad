00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:03.119
&gt;&gt; Today,
I'm talking with Grahame Grieve,

00:00:03.119 --> 00:00:08.210
the project leader of the global
HL7 FHIR standardization effort.

00:00:08.210 --> 00:00:09.840
He's here all the way from Melbourne,

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.800
Australia for
an HL7 meeting this week in Atlanta.

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:16.510
Grahame, thank you very much for
taking the time to be with me.

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:17.840
I know this is a busy week for

00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:22.900
you, perhaps we could begin by
discussing your background.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.780
&gt;&gt; So I qualified as a biochemist,
worked in a clinical lab and

00:00:26.780 --> 00:00:31.745
did a bit of research, and then I ended
up as a lab systems vendor tech lead and

00:00:31.745 --> 00:00:34.947
got more involved in
interoperability in HL7.

00:00:34.947 --> 00:00:39.656
And eventually, created my own
consulting company to do HL7 consulting.

00:00:39.656 --> 00:00:45.004
&gt;&gt; So beginning in 2011,
you invented the whole idea of FHIR.

00:00:45.004 --> 00:00:47.282
Can you tell us how that happened?

00:00:47.282 --> 00:00:51.892
&gt;&gt; We were getting to a point
where the HL7 was at a crossroads.

00:00:51.892 --> 00:00:56.658
We had a lot of existing standards that
no longer reflected what people wanted

00:00:56.658 --> 00:01:00.561
to do and there was a lot of
unhappiness in the music community.

00:01:00.561 --> 00:01:04.063
And we said, well,
what if we do something like this, and

00:01:04.063 --> 00:01:05.354
that grew into FHIR.

00:01:05.354 --> 00:01:09.401
It was a bit of a surprise to me as
much as to everyone else that it was so

00:01:09.401 --> 00:01:13.094
popular, but it's been certainly
keeping busy ever since.

00:01:13.094 --> 00:01:17.489
&gt;&gt; By all accounts, the growth of FHIR
adoption is nothing short of phenomenal.

00:01:17.489 --> 00:01:22.492
Could you give us an idea of how it's
being adopted not just here in the US,

00:01:22.492 --> 00:01:24.038
but around the world?

00:01:24.038 --> 00:01:28.746
&gt;&gt; Well, we expected that initially
while it's still a trial beta standard,

00:01:28.746 --> 00:01:32.643
which it still is, that we would
have a little bit of adoption,

00:01:32.643 --> 00:01:37.496
particularly in companies doing health
data exchange in the social web area,

00:01:37.496 --> 00:01:39.210
but it's just been crazy.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.520
We have government programs, large
government programs, some ONC programs.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.885
Other national governments around
the world that have big vendors

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:55.920
creating consortiums like Argonaut and
HSBC, lots of little companies,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:02:00.247
and institutions creating
solutions based on FHIR.

00:02:00.247 --> 00:02:03.284
We have thousands of implementations
happening at the moment.

00:02:03.284 --> 00:02:10.133
&gt;&gt; So I believe the ballot on FHIR as
a second version of a draft standard for

00:02:10.133 --> 00:02:15.172
trial use was just conducted or
is being conducted.

00:02:15.172 --> 00:02:20.757
Where are we in the whole evolution
of FHIR to a full HL7 standard?

00:02:20.757 --> 00:02:24.363
&gt;&gt; So we had balanced it
to standard in May, and

00:02:24.363 --> 00:02:30.610
then we just published last week in
September, the formal second version.

00:02:30.610 --> 00:02:35.730
It's an ongoing process where we
started with a very initial draft and

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:39.736
then I think of this as
the first fully usable version.

00:02:39.736 --> 00:02:43.627
And we're calling it a trial version, so

00:02:43.627 --> 00:02:49.753
we can still introduce new content and
refine the core standard.

00:02:49.753 --> 00:02:55.172
But increasingly, we're going to treat
the core as a normative standard and

00:02:55.172 --> 00:02:59.472
I think the next version will
represent a stable version for

00:02:59.472 --> 00:03:03.098
implementors to base
the core clinical stuff on.

00:03:03.098 --> 00:03:05.292
But it's an ongoing process and

00:03:05.292 --> 00:03:10.412
we'll be very driven by the feedback
we get from the community about that,

00:03:10.412 --> 00:03:14.491
which is why we're not saying
right now how it will unfold.

00:03:14.491 --> 00:03:16.598
We don't want to dictate
to the community.

00:03:16.598 --> 00:03:20.906
&gt;&gt; Well, I've heard numbers in terms of
the ultimate number of FHIR resources

00:03:20.906 --> 00:03:22.802
anywhere from 100 to 200.

00:03:22.802 --> 00:03:25.681
I suppose nobody actually
knows at this point.

00:03:25.681 --> 00:03:27.969
&gt;&gt; Well, we have 96 as of today.

00:03:27.969 --> 00:03:31.008
And we sort of said,
200 was a nice number.

00:03:31.008 --> 00:03:35.548
We didn't want to have thousands or
hundreds of thousands,

00:03:35.548 --> 00:03:37.923
which were possible choices.

00:03:37.923 --> 00:03:40.430
We haven't got a fixed number
that we're going to get to.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:43.408
&gt;&gt; So
that leads directly to a topic you and

00:03:43.408 --> 00:03:47.299
I have discussed when we
were together in the past.

00:03:47.299 --> 00:03:51.963
To me, the whole, I mean, obviously, the
use of web services and JSON objects,

00:03:51.963 --> 00:03:56.156
these technologies are so common in
other domains is very interesting and

00:03:56.156 --> 00:03:58.811
I think very important
to the success of FHIR.

00:03:58.811 --> 00:04:03.631
But perhaps even more interesting
is your mission of not allowing

00:04:03.631 --> 00:04:07.573
FHIR to become an overly
complex standard like many of

00:04:07.573 --> 00:04:10.304
the predecessor standards in HL7.

00:04:10.304 --> 00:04:11.055
How is that going?

00:04:11.055 --> 00:04:14.430
That must be a very tough thing to do.

00:04:14.430 --> 00:04:17.029
&gt;&gt; It's an interesting thing to try and
do.

00:04:17.029 --> 00:04:20.786
We have constant pressures to try and
simplify it, and

00:04:20.786 --> 00:04:23.980
constant pressures to try and
complicate it.

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:28.896
And we've gotta strike a balance between
handling the things people need to do,

00:04:28.896 --> 00:04:33.176
and not letting it get so complicated
no one can do what they need to do.

00:04:33.176 --> 00:04:37.868
Most of the success in that area
comes from the processes that

00:04:37.868 --> 00:04:42.100
we laid down at the start
around soul of engagement with

00:04:42.100 --> 00:04:46.892
the implementation community and
being responsive to them.

00:04:46.892 --> 00:04:51.572
And we grade the success of parts of
the standard not by publication, but

00:04:51.572 --> 00:04:56.023
by adoption, and that's a very
important metric that drives a wider

00:04:56.023 --> 00:05:00.804
consideration of the perspective than
just how do we produce a standard.

00:05:00.804 --> 00:05:04.349
&gt;&gt; So, the people who only
have to use the standard and

00:05:04.349 --> 00:05:08.651
implement it have a big voice
in what the standard looks like.

00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.752
And it isn't just designed by,
I'll use the term standards geeks.

00:05:13.752 --> 00:05:16.611
I hope that isn't a pejorative term.

00:05:16.611 --> 00:05:18.155
&gt;&gt; That's a very common term.

00:05:18.155 --> 00:05:22.039
That's exactly what we're
trying to achieve, so

00:05:22.039 --> 00:05:25.753
that you can define
the standard as a committee.

00:05:25.753 --> 00:05:29.358
But until it's been adopted and
proven in practice,

00:05:29.358 --> 00:05:32.080
it's always going to be draft.

00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:36.977
&gt;&gt; So as you look out toward
the future after the final version of

00:05:36.977 --> 00:05:41.875
FHIR is published, how do you
see it continuing to evolve and

00:05:41.875 --> 00:05:45.380
adapt to an ever changing world?

00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.062
&gt;&gt; Any community goes through the phases
of storming, norming and conforming.

00:05:50.062 --> 00:05:54.682
And clearly, the core of
the specification is moving into

00:05:54.682 --> 00:05:59.492
the norming phase now and
will become more and more stable and

00:05:59.492 --> 00:06:02.334
growth will happen at the margins.

00:06:02.334 --> 00:06:05.879
And then there's at some
point where you'll say

00:06:05.879 --> 00:06:09.260
that the standard is now
got as big as it can be.

00:06:09.260 --> 00:06:13.496
It's no longer efficient to keep growing
and to keep pushing it along, and

00:06:13.496 --> 00:06:16.129
it's time to start
considering a new choice.

00:06:16.129 --> 00:06:20.806
I kind of thought, just looking
at the past record of standards

00:06:20.806 --> 00:06:24.875
that a development lifespan
might be 15 years or so.

00:06:24.875 --> 00:06:27.818
I mean, it's sort of 5 of 15 now.

00:06:27.818 --> 00:06:29.841
And then at that point,

00:06:29.841 --> 00:06:34.908
you start to say maybe it's no
longer worth keeping going.

00:06:34.908 --> 00:06:36.675
That's ten years out,
we'll see how we go.

00:06:36.675 --> 00:06:40.194
But at some point, you go,
it's just not worth keeping going.

00:06:40.194 --> 00:06:41.295
&gt;&gt; So, one final question.

00:06:41.295 --> 00:06:46.193
So what would you say to the students
taking this course about FHIR and

00:06:46.193 --> 00:06:50.583
about how they might both think
about it, use it, and look for

00:06:50.583 --> 00:06:53.126
opportunities that FHIR creates?

00:06:53.126 --> 00:06:56.903
&gt;&gt; FHIR's really different to all
the other approaches we've had,

00:06:56.903 --> 00:07:00.006
because it allows you to
modularize your solutions and

00:07:00.006 --> 00:07:04.062
to create capabilities that can be
used in all sorts of different ways.

00:07:04.062 --> 00:07:09.002
And so in the long-term it's
going to represent decomposing large

00:07:09.002 --> 00:07:14.033
systems into more interruptible
small systems and there's going to

00:07:14.033 --> 00:07:19.059
be a lot of opportunity for
change in the healthcare system not IT,

00:07:19.059 --> 00:07:24.897
but in healthcare itself driven by the
capabilities of the decomposition and

00:07:24.897 --> 00:07:27.449
the flexibility that it offers.

00:07:27.449 --> 00:07:30.683
We didn't write FHIR because we
wanted to have a nice standard.

00:07:30.683 --> 00:07:33.971
We wrote FHIR because we wanted
implementations to drive a better

00:07:33.971 --> 00:07:35.137
healthcare system.

00:07:35.137 --> 00:07:40.252
And that's going to be our main focus
going forwards is we'll round out

00:07:40.252 --> 00:07:45.114
the standard and finalize the standard,
but our main focus is going to

00:07:45.114 --> 00:07:50.143
be how do we drive that to get
a healthcare system that's more nimble,

00:07:50.143 --> 00:07:54.234
more patient focused,
more responsive to it to change,

00:07:54.234 --> 00:07:57.338
because the existing
system's pretty rigid.

00:07:57.338 --> 00:07:59.272
&gt;&gt; Well, I not only want to thank you,

00:07:59.272 --> 00:08:02.695
I want to tell you how much I
admire you and what you're doing.

00:08:02.695 --> 00:08:05.313
I'm a lot older than you are.

00:08:05.313 --> 00:08:09.456
I'm not even sure you were born when
I got involved in health IT, and

00:08:09.456 --> 00:08:13.236
I never thought I'd actually
live to see what we're seeing,

00:08:13.236 --> 00:08:18.109
which I agree with you completely is
an absolutely workable, implementable,

00:08:18.109 --> 00:08:20.947
deployable solution to
interoperability and

00:08:20.947 --> 00:08:24.977
to actually making health data
a tool for improving healthcare.

00:08:24.977 --> 00:08:26.280
So, congratulations.

00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.506
Thank you so much.

00:08:27.506 --> 00:08:28.140
&gt;&gt; Thanks.
