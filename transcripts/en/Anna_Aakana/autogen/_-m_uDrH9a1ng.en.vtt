00:00:00.219 --> 00:00:02.729
Usually the universe will send us a message.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.670
This message is the next step in our personal and spiritual development;

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:17.520
the lesson that we need to learn to grow, and if you ignore the universe, it'll just get louder

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.980
Oh a phone call

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:21.640
*awkward chuckle*

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.860
What is this a personal attack?

00:00:23.860 --> 00:00:24.380
and louder

00:00:25.100 --> 00:00:27.420
You can't ignore me Anna, this is the universe

00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:30.560
I have a very important message for you.

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:33.860
Okay, I need you to know your value.

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.960
until finally, it seems kind of ridiculous.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:37.960
in theory, Would you want this...

00:00:38.320 --> 00:00:39.720
twenty dollars?

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:43.560
In theory? Yeah, but I guess also in reality, Yeah.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.340
even if I did this?

00:00:51.580 --> 00:00:52.920
uhh...

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:54.400
Yeah?

00:00:54.400 --> 00:00:56.460
what about this?

00:00:58.200 --> 00:00:59.940
Yeah, I mean it's still $20

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.020
what if I farted on it?

00:01:01.020 --> 00:01:02.920
no, actually I would definitely pass in that case,

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:04.740
okay, well, I mean never mind then but like

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.000
isn't it nteresting that no matter how much I beat up this twenty-dollar bill

00:01:10.300 --> 00:01:14.140
it still has its inherent value?

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:16.200
*sighs*

00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:18.600
Okay, I get it!

00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:20.700
who are you talking to?

00:01:20.700 --> 00:01:22.980
So for the last few years, my one goal has been to

00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:30.100
recognize my self-worth and to practice self-love, and you know, in the midst of things it's really hard to tell whether or not change is

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:32.880
actually happening but, a few months ago,

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:35.580
someone I've been seeing romantically told me

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:39.940
so I've like, decided, I don't actually want a relationship anymore, but don't worry

00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:45.720
I'm still down to like chill and have all the perks of a relationship without any of the emotional accountability

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.800
Now freeze on my big, dumb, stupid face!

00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:51.800
old Anna would have a hundred percent said

00:01:52.020 --> 00:01:59.500
Oh, yeah, of course. That's tight, Right. That's like a solid deal. Yeah I mean, that's exactly what I want that lines up

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:01.600
While inside I would have thought...

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.940
why don't they like me enough to commit, you know

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:09.040
maybe if I stick around they'll see how awesome I am and change their mind like, I can prove to them that I'm a really

00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.200
Great person and I would make a great partner

00:02:11.500 --> 00:02:14.500
But not today satan, today, I say...

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:16.370
Okay, well

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:23.060
I totally understand that but I'm actually looking for a commitment and I can't just like hang out with people without developing feelings so,

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:26.540
I'll have to bow out but it was really nice getting to know you

00:02:26.540 --> 00:02:27.960
I was so proud of myself you guys

00:02:28.020 --> 00:02:29.380
and I know it doesn't seem like a big deal

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:29.980
but this,

00:02:30.460 --> 00:02:33.860
This is me knowing that I am worthy of being committed to

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:37.420
In the past, my usual MO has been that "I'll stick around,"

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:45.280
confident that I'm gonna grow on them like a barnacle and/or fungus, and become so indispensable to their life that they can't help but make me their girlfriend,

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.740
but not anymore! I have listened to the universe! I hath leeearnt *Trump gesture*

00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:54.340
So for those of you struggling with knowing your value, how do we get here?

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.060
Well in therapy, I'm learning about positive resilience.

00:02:57.180 --> 00:03:00.320
So my therapist says that our brains pick out our flaws, right?

00:03:00.380 --> 00:03:05.049
We're designed to look for the negative and focus on our weaknesses because it's how we survive

00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:13.419
So to cultivate a sense of self-worth, we need to shift that focus onto our strengths, believe in ourselves, and be clear about our values

00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:19.689
That means knowing your boundaries, having the courage to speak up for yourself, and finding ways to validate yourself from within,

00:03:19.910 --> 00:03:24.519
Instead of externally. That one I haven't quite figured out yet because I love attention. Now

00:03:24.519 --> 00:03:28.209
I know this is all very abstract. Right? Like how do we get to this practically?

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:29.110
well

00:03:29.110 --> 00:03:31.779
There are many ways and you can find the ones that speak to you,

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:36.939
whether that's taking the Clifton strengths assessment and taking a moment to reflect every week about how you

00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:42.999
exhibited your strengths, therefore doing one rep and mentally solidifying positive resilience, or you can write

00:03:43.190 --> 00:03:50.589
affirmations over and over again to take advantage of the link between what we write down, and how we affect our subconscious beliefs.

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:57.800
you can explore these issues in therapy: future- self journal to shift your patterns, and/or listen to guided meditations

00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:04.900
one thing you must absolutely do is give yourself time, measure change in six -month increments, sometimes year increments

00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:09.440
because when you're in the muck of day-to-day journaling or repeating affirmations in the mirror,

00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.740
I'M BEAUTIFUL! I'M BEAUTIFUL! I'M BEAUTIFUL!

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:14.400
It can be hard to really see whether or not it's working,

00:04:14.660 --> 00:04:21.040
but after you've been at it for a substantial amount of time, when the opportunity arises, you'll see whether or not you're making progress.

00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:25.760
So do not be discouraged, because before you know it, you will see the difference.

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.780
I want a relationship with you

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:30.960
and also you

00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.460
and you

00:04:32.460 --> 00:04:34.460
NO, ABSOLUTELY NOT

00:04:34.960 --> 00:04:36.000
Aye!

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:36.500
look at us!

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:37.480
Yaas

00:04:37.480 --> 00:04:42.060
oh my God *chatter* *chatter*

00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:45.640
I'm Anna Akana, thank you to CARE OF for sponsoring today's video

00:04:46.070 --> 00:04:49.510
Because I am both a vegetarian and a bit of a health nut, every day

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:52.539
I take the multivitamin, probiotic and biotin for ma hair n' nails

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.590
vitamins to me have always been like

00:04:54.590 --> 00:05:00.250
Insurance, in case I get too stressed out and I haven't eaten what I need to, or if I'm not paying attention to

00:05:00.260 --> 00:05:02.260
my protein sources and being a junk food vegetarian

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.440
I definitely notice a difference in my sleep quality and my mood when I'm getting what my body needs

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.520
But I know that figuring out what your body needs can be annoying and overwhelming, So CARE OF makes vitamins easy

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:19.960
You just take a five-minute quiz and they suggest which vitamins you need based on your dietary requirements and lifestyle

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:23.829
They also have some new veggie protein powders and on the go sticks that I am living for

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:31.000
prices start at just 20 dollars a month and vary depending on your personalized pack the first 200 people to click the link in the
