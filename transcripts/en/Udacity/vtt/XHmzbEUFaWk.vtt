00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:05.715
Development can be divided into six main stages on the timeline. Prenatal,

00:00:05.715 --> 00:00:11.892
infancy childhood, adolescence, adulthood and finally late adulthood. Within

00:00:11.892 --> 00:00:16.230
these stages there are domains or topics that psychologists are interested in.

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:19.920
This focuses in the changes in our neurological structures in the brain. Then

00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:23.560
we have Sensory Development. This focuses on how our senses change as we

00:00:23.560 --> 00:00:28.626
develop. For example, how our vision develops. We also look at our physical and

00:00:28.626 --> 00:00:32.183
motor development. This looks at the development of our physical movement and

00:00:32.183 --> 00:00:37.455
body control. For example, when you crawl or walk. We also look at our

00:00:37.455 --> 00:00:41.396
cognitive development. This domain focuses on our ability to think, solve

00:00:41.396 --> 00:00:46.046
problems, learn new things and remember things. And finally, our social and

00:00:46.046 --> 00:00:50.872
emotional development. This focuses on things like attachment and how infants

00:00:50.872 --> 00:00:55.910
form attachments. And how those attachments will affect future relationships.

00:00:55.910 --> 00:00:58.657
These are just some of the aspects developmental psychologists are interested

00:00:58.657 --> 00:01:02.809
in. In this lesson, we'll go through each of the major stages of development,

00:01:02.809 --> 00:01:06.980
and discuss the changes during them. Some psychological domains are going to be

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.540
more important in certain stages than in others. So, we might not go over all

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:16.260
six domains in each stage of life, but we'll definitely touch on each of them.

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.770
So, with that said, why don't we go on to see how these psychological processes

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:22.379
unfold from conception to death.
