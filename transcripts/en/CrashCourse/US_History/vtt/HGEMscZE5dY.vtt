Episode 31: Feminism and Suffrage

00:00:01.489 --> 00:00:04.060
Hi, I’m John Green, this is Crash Course
U.S. history and today we’re going to talk

00:00:04.060 --> 00:00:06.049
about women in the progressive era.

00:00:06.049 --> 00:00:08.170
My God, that is a fantastic hat.

00:00:08.170 --> 00:00:09.759
Wait, votes for women??

00:00:09.759 --> 00:00:14.110
So between Teddy Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson,
and all those doughboys headed off to war,

00:00:14.110 --> 00:00:17.430
women in this period have sort of been footnoted
shockingly..

00:00:17.430 --> 00:00:18.570
Mr. Green, Mr. Green.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:19.769
I’d NEVER make a woman a footnote.

00:00:19.769 --> 00:00:24.529
She’d be the center of my world, my raison
d’etre, my joie de vivre.

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:25.660
Oh, Me from the Past.

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.619
I’m reminded of why you got a C+ in French
3.

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:32.870
Let me submit to you, Me from the Past, that
your weird worship of women is a kind of misogyny

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:37.820
because you’re imagining women as these
beautiful, fragile things that you can possess.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:39.930
It turns out that women are not things.

00:00:39.930 --> 00:00:44.000
They are people in precisely the same way
that you are a person and in the progressive

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.210
era, they demanded to be seen as full citizens
of the United States.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:50.800
In short, women don’t exist to be your joie
de vivre.

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:54.220
They get to have their own joie de vivre.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:01:03.120
intro
So, it’s tempting to limit ourselves to

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.859
discussion of women getting the right to vote
with the passage of the 19th amendment, but

00:01:06.859 --> 00:01:10.270
if we focus too much on the constitutional
history, we’re gonna miss a lot.

00:01:10.270 --> 00:01:14.659
Some historians refer to the thirty years
between 1890 and 1920 as the “women’s

00:01:14.659 --> 00:01:18.450
era” because it was in that time that women
started to have greater economic and political

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:19.450
opportunities.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:23.360
Women were also aided by legal changes, like
getting the right to own property, control

00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.799
their wages and make contracts and wills.

00:01:25.799 --> 00:01:30.799
By 1900 almost 5 million women worked for
wages, mainly in domestic service or light

00:01:30.799 --> 00:01:32.850
manufacturing, like the garment industry.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:36.829
Women in America were always vital contributors
to the economy as producers and consumers

00:01:36.829 --> 00:01:41.219
and they always worked, whether for wages
or taking care of children and the home.

00:01:41.219 --> 00:01:44.909
And as someone who has recently returned from
paternity leave, let me tell you, that ain’t

00:01:44.909 --> 00:01:45.909
no joke.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.179
And American women were also active as reformers
since, like, America became a thing.

00:01:50.179 --> 00:01:54.020
And those reform movements brought women into
state and national politics before the dawn

00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:55.189
of the progressive era.

00:01:55.189 --> 00:01:59.439
Unfortunately, their greatest achievement,
Prohibition, was also our greatest national

00:01:59.439 --> 00:02:00.439
shame.

00:02:00.439 --> 00:02:01.439
Oh, yeah, alright, okay.

00:02:01.439 --> 00:02:05.130
It’s actually not in our top 5 national
shames.

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:08.860
But, probably women’s greatest influence
indeed came through membership AND leadership

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.350
in the Women’s Christian Temperance Union.

00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:18.440
The WCTU was founded in 1874 and by 1890 it
had 150,000 members, making it the largest

00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:20.450
female organization in the United States.

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:24.830
Under the leadership of Frances Willard, the
WCTU embraced a broad reform agenda.

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:27.390
Like it included pushing for the right for
women to vote.

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:31.040
The feeling was that the best way to stop
people from drinking was to pass local laws

00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.510
that made it harder to drink, and to do that
it would be very helpful if women could vote.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:38.940
Because American men were a bunch of alcoholic
scoundrels who darn well weren’t going to

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:40.970
vote to get rid of beer hoses.

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.170
In 1895 Willard boldly declared, “A wider
freedom is coming to the women of America.

00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:50.930
Too long has it been held that woman has no
right to enter these movements (…) Politics

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:52.340
is the place for woman.”

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.870
But the role of women in politics did greatly
expand during the Progressive era.

00:02:55.870 --> 00:03:00.220
As in prior decades, many reformers were middle
and upper class women, but the growing economy

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:04.190
and the expansion of what might be called
the upper-middle class meant that there were

00:03:04.190 --> 00:03:09.390
more educational opportunities and this growing
group of college-educated women leaned in

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:11.510
and became the leaders of new movements.

00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:13.680
Sorry, there was no way I was gonna get through
this without one “lean in.”

00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680
I love that book.

00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:18.420
So as we’ve talked about before, the 1890s
saw the dawning of the American mass consumer

00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:22.490
society and many of the new products made
in the second wave of industrialization were

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:26.420
aimed at women, especially “labor-saving”
devices like washing machines.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.780
If you’ve ever had an infant, you might
notice that they poop and barf on everything

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:31.780
all the time.

00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:35.470
Like, I recently called the pediatrician and
I was like, “My 14-day-old daughter poops

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:36.751
fifteen times a day.”

00:03:36.751 --> 00:03:38.990
And he was like, “If anything, that seems
low.”

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:41.260
So the washing machine is a real game-changer.

00:03:41.260 --> 00:03:46.000
And many women realized that being the primary
consumers who did the shopping for the home

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.210
gave them powerful leverage to bring about
change.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:53.690
Chief among these was Florence Kelley, a college-educated
woman who after participating in a number

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:57.810
of progressive reform causes came to head
the National Consumers League.

00:03:57.810 --> 00:04:02.440
The League sponsored boycotts and shaped consumption
patterns encouraging consumers to buy products

00:04:02.440 --> 00:04:06.030
that were made without child or what we now
would call sweatshop labor.

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.490
Which at the time was often just known as
“labor.”

00:04:08.490 --> 00:04:12.260
And there was also a subtle shift in gender
roles as more and more women worked outside

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:13.260
the home.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:17.499
African American women continued to work primarily
as domestic servants or in agriculture, and

00:04:17.499 --> 00:04:22.079
immigrant women mostly did low-paying factory
labor, but for native-born white women there

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.060
were new opportunities, especially in office
work.

00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:28.020
And this points to how technology created
opportunities for women.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.039
Like, almost all the telephone operators in
the U.S. were women.

00:04:31.039 --> 00:04:36.879
By 1920 office workers and telephone operators
made up 25% of the female workforce, while

00:04:36.879 --> 00:04:38.999
domestic servants were only 15%.

00:04:38.999 --> 00:04:43.240
A union leader named Abraham Bisno remarked
that working gave immigrant women a sense

00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:47.590
of independence: “They acquired the right
to personality, something alien to the highly

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:50.340
patriarchal family structures of the old country.”

00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:53.730
Of course this also meant that young women
were often in conflict with their parents,

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:58.699
as a job brought more freedom, money, and
perhaps, if they were lucky, a room of one’s

00:04:58.699 --> 00:04:59.699
own.

00:04:59.699 --> 00:05:00.699
Oh, it’s time for the Mystery Document?

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.650
Please let it be Virginia Woolf, please let
it be Virginia Woolf.

00:05:03.650 --> 00:05:04.740
The rules here are simple.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:06.460
I guess the author of the Mystery Document.

00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.020
I’m either right or I get shocked.

00:05:08.020 --> 00:05:09.520
Alright, let’s see what we’ve got.

00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:13.711
“The spirit of personal independence in
the women of today is sure proof that a change

00:05:13.711 --> 00:05:18.650
has come … the radical change in the economic
position of women is advancing upon us…

00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:23.479
The growing individualization of democratic
life brings inevitable changes to our daughters

00:05:23.479 --> 00:05:27.560
as well as to our sons … One of its most
noticeable features is the demand in women

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:32.150
not only for their own money, but for their
own work for the sake of personal expression.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:37.210
Few girls today fail to manifest some signs
of the desire for individual expression …”

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:39.240
Well, that’s not Virginia Woolf.

00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.009
Stan, I’m going to be honest, I do not know
the answer to this one.

00:05:42.009 --> 00:05:45.810
However, it has been Woodrow Wilson for the
last two weeks.

00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:48.150
You wouldn’t do that again to me, or would
you?

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.020
I’m gonna guess Woodrow Wilson.

00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:51.020
Final answer.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:52.020
DANG IT.

00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:55.509
Charlotte Perkins Gilman in the book Women
and Economics?

00:05:55.509 --> 00:05:56.509
What?

00:05:56.509 --> 00:05:57.509
Aaaaaah!

00:05:57.509 --> 00:06:00.979
The idea that having a job is valuable just
for the independence that it brings and as

00:06:00.979 --> 00:06:05.629
a form of “individual expression” was
pretty radical, as most women, and especially

00:06:05.629 --> 00:06:09.860
most men, were not comfortable with the idea
that being a housewife was similar to being

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.039
a servant to one’s husband and children.

00:06:12.039 --> 00:06:15.889
But of course that changes when staying at
home becomes one of many choices rather than

00:06:15.889 --> 00:06:17.449
your only available option.

00:06:17.449 --> 00:06:19.949
And then came birth control.

00:06:19.949 --> 00:06:21.159
Huzzah!

00:06:21.159 --> 00:06:24.330
Women who needed to work wanted a way to limit
the number of pregnancies.

00:06:24.330 --> 00:06:28.389
Being pregnant and having a baby can make
it difficult to hold down a job and also babies

00:06:28.389 --> 00:06:31.159
are diaper-using, stuff-breaking, consumptive
machines.

00:06:31.159 --> 00:06:32.460
They basically eat money.

00:06:32.460 --> 00:06:33.460
And we love them.

00:06:33.460 --> 00:06:37.080
But birth control advocates like Margaret
Sanger and Emma Goldman also argued that women

00:06:37.080 --> 00:06:40.599
should be able to enjoy sex without having
children.

00:06:40.599 --> 00:06:42.599
To which men said, “Women can enjoy sex?”

00:06:42.599 --> 00:06:47.490
Believe it or not, that was seen as a pretty
radical idea and it lead to changes in sexual

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:50.490
behavior including more overall skoodilypooping.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.729
Goldman was arrested more than 40 times for
sharing these dangerous ideas about female

00:06:54.729 --> 00:06:57.490
sexuality and birth control and she was eventually
deported.

00:06:57.490 --> 00:07:01.339
Sanger, who worked to educate working class
women about birth control, was sentenced to

00:07:01.339 --> 00:07:06.360
prison in 1916 for opening a clinic in Brooklyn
that distributed contraceptive devices to

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.400
poor immigrant women.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:10.499
The fight over birth control is important
for at least three reasons.

00:07:10.499 --> 00:07:14.370
First, it put women into the forefront of
debates about free speech in America.

00:07:14.370 --> 00:07:17.960
I mean, some of the most ardent advocates
of birth control were also associated with

00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:20.500
the IWW and the Socialist Party.

00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:24.931
Secondly, birth control is also a public health
issue and many women during the progressive

00:07:24.931 --> 00:07:29.440
era entered public life to bring about changes
related to public health, leading the crusade

00:07:29.440 --> 00:07:33.089
against tuberculosis, the so-called White
Plague, and other diseases.

00:07:33.089 --> 00:07:35.520
Thirdly, it cut across class lines.

00:07:35.520 --> 00:07:39.479
Having or not having children is an issue
for all women, regardless of whether they

00:07:39.479 --> 00:07:44.050
went to college, and the birth control movement
brought upper, middle, and lower class women

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:47.080
together in ways that other social movements
never did.

00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:50.369
Another group of Progressive women took up
the role of addressing the problems of the

00:07:50.369 --> 00:07:52.949
poor and spearheaded the Settlement House
movement.

00:07:52.949 --> 00:07:55.150
The key figure here was Jane Addams.

00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:57.310
My God, there are still Adamses in American
history?

00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:00.789
Oh, she spells it Addams-family-Addams, not
like founding-fathers-Adams.

00:08:00.789 --> 00:08:04.020
Anyway, she started Hull House in Chicago
in 1889.

00:08:04.020 --> 00:08:08.130
Settlement houses became the incubators of
the new field of social work, a field in which

00:08:08.130 --> 00:08:09.520
women played a huge part.

00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.509
And Addams became one of America’s most
important spokespeople for progressive ideas.

00:08:13.509 --> 00:08:17.979
And yet in many places, while all of this
was happening, women could not technically

00:08:17.979 --> 00:08:18.979
vote.

00:08:18.979 --> 00:08:21.229
But their increasing involvement in social
movements at the turn of the 20th century

00:08:21.229 --> 00:08:23.560
led them to electoral politics.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.860
It’s true that women were voting before
the passage of the 19th amendment in 1920.

00:08:27.860 --> 00:08:32.070
Voting is a state issue, and in many western
states, women were granted the right to vote

00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.610
in the late 19th century.

00:08:33.610 --> 00:08:37.240
States could also grant women the right to
run for office, which explains how the first

00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.110
Congresswoman, Jeannette Rankin, could vote
against America’s entry into World War I

00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:42.120
in 1917.

00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:47.050
That said, the passage and ratification of
the 19th Amendment is a big deal in American

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:48.050
history.

00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:49.139
It’s also a recent deal.

00:08:49.139 --> 00:08:54.279
Like, when my grandmothers were born, women
could not vote in much of the United States.

00:08:54.279 --> 00:08:58.860
The amendment says that states cannot deny
people the right to vote because they are

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:02.190
women, which isn’t as interesting as the
political organization and activity that led

00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:03.190
to its passage.

00:09:03.190 --> 00:09:04.310
Alright, let’s go to the Thought Bubble.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.000
The suffrage movement was extremely fragmented.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:11.690
There was a first wave of suffrage, exemplified
by the women at Seneca Falls, and this metamorphosed

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:16.290
into the National American Women’s Suffrage
Association, or NAWSA.

00:09:16.290 --> 00:09:20.440
Most of the leadership of NAWSA was made up
of middle to upper class women, often involved

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.330
in other progressive causes, who unfortunately
sometimes represented the darker side of the

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:26.330
suffrage movement.

00:09:26.330 --> 00:09:30.430
Because these upper class progressives frequently
used nativist arguments to make their claims

00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:31.740
for the right to vote.

00:09:31.740 --> 00:09:35.810
They argued that if the vote could be granted
to ignorant immigrants, some of whom could

00:09:35.810 --> 00:09:39.290
barely speak English, then it should also
be granted to native born women.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:43.930
This isn’t to say that the elitist arguments
won the day, but they should be acknowledged.

00:09:43.930 --> 00:09:48.000
By the early 20th century a new generation
of college-educated activists had arrived

00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:49.000
on the scene.

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.180
And many of these women were more radical
than early suffrage supporters.

00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.250
They organized the National Women’s Party
and, under the leadership of Alice Paul, pushed

00:09:56.250 --> 00:09:59.940
for the vote using aggressive tactics that
many of the early generation of women’s

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.370
rights advocates found unseemly.

00:10:01.370 --> 00:10:06.720
Paul had been studying in Britain between
1907 and 1910 where she saw the more militant

00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:08.380
women’s rights activists at work.

00:10:08.380 --> 00:10:13.430
She adopted their tactics that included protests
leading to imprisonment and loud denunciations

00:10:13.430 --> 00:10:15.959
of the patriarchy that would make tumblr proud.

00:10:15.959 --> 00:10:20.540
And during World War I she compared Wilson
to the Kaiser and Paul and her followers chained

00:10:20.540 --> 00:10:22.250
themselves to the White House fence.

00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:25.709
The activists then started a hunger strike
during their 7-month prison sentence and had

00:10:25.709 --> 00:10:27.410
to be force-fed.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:32.120
Woodrow Wilson had half-heartedly endorsed
women’s suffrage in 1916, but the war split

00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.410
the movement further.

00:10:33.410 --> 00:10:37.209
Most suffrage organizations believed that
wartime service would help women earn respect

00:10:37.209 --> 00:10:38.209
and equal rights.

00:10:38.209 --> 00:10:42.319
But other activists, like many Progressives,
opposed the war and regarded it as a potential

00:10:42.319 --> 00:10:43.589
threat to social reform.

00:10:43.589 --> 00:10:46.490
But, in the end, the war did sort of end up
helping the cause.

00:10:46.490 --> 00:10:51.100
Patriotic support of the war by women, especially
their service working in wartime industries,

00:10:51.100 --> 00:10:54.310
convinced many that it was just wrong to deny
them the right to vote.

00:10:54.310 --> 00:10:58.610
And the mistreatment of Alice Paul and other
women in prison for their cause created outrage

00:10:58.610 --> 00:11:02.250
that further pushed the Wilson administration
to support enfranchising women.

00:11:02.250 --> 00:11:03.250
Thanks, Thought Bubble.

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:06.750
So, women’s long fight to gain the right
to vote ended with the ratification of the

00:11:06.750 --> 00:11:08.200
19th Amendment in 1920.

00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:12.350
But, in some ways, the final granting of the
franchise was a bit anti-climactic.

00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:16.750
For one thing, it was overshadowed by the
18th Amendment, Prohibition, which affected

00:11:16.750 --> 00:11:18.970
both women and men in large numbers.

00:11:18.970 --> 00:11:19.970
Also Gatsbys.

00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.819
You could say a lot of bad things about Prohibition,
and I have, but the crusade against alcohol

00:11:23.819 --> 00:11:29.160
did galvanize and politicize many women, and
organizations such as the WCTU and the Anti-Saloon

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.660
League introduced yet more to political activism.

00:11:31.660 --> 00:11:35.890
But, while the passage of the 19th amendment
was a huge victory, Alice Paul and the National

00:11:35.890 --> 00:11:39.970
Women’s Party were unable to muster the
same support for an Equal Rights Amendment.

00:11:39.970 --> 00:11:45.140
Paul believed that women needed equal access
to education and employment opportunities.

00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.779
And here they came into contact with other
women’s groups, especially the League of

00:11:48.779 --> 00:11:53.560
Women Voters and the Women’s Trade Union
League, which opposed the ERA fearing that

00:11:53.560 --> 00:11:58.139
equal rights would mean an unraveling of hard-won
benefits like mother’s pensions and laws

00:11:58.139 --> 00:11:59.720
limiting women’s hours of labor.

00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:03.699
So, the ERA failed, and then another proposed
amendment that would have given Congress the

00:12:03.699 --> 00:12:10.420
power to limit child labor won ratification
in only 6 states.

00:12:10.420 --> 00:12:18.441
So in many ways the period between 1890 and
1920, which roughly corresponds to the Progressive

00:12:18.441 --> 00:12:21.709
Era, was the high tide of women’s rights
and political activism.

00:12:21.709 --> 00:12:25.940
It culminated in the ratification of the 19th
amendment, but the right to vote didn’t

00:12:25.940 --> 00:12:30.310
lead to significant legislation that actually
improved the lives of women, at least not

00:12:30.310 --> 00:12:31.310
for a while.

00:12:31.310 --> 00:12:34.351
Nor were there immediate changes in the roles
that women were expected to play in the social

00:12:34.351 --> 00:12:35.930
order as wives and mothers.

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:40.280
Still, women were able to increase their autonomy
and freedom in the burgeoning consumer marketplace.

00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.600
But it’s important to note that like other
oppressed populations in American history,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:48.920
women weren’t given these rights, they had
to fight for the rights that were said to

00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:49.920
be inalienable.

00:12:49.920 --> 00:12:52.709
And we are all better off for their fight
and for their victory.

00:12:52.709 --> 00:12:57.540
Women’s liberation is to be sure a complicated
phrase and it will take a new turn in the

00:12:57.540 --> 00:12:59.610
Roaring 20s, which we’ll talk about next
week.

00:12:59.610 --> 00:13:00.829
I’ll see you then.

00:13:00.829 --> 00:13:03.190
Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan
Muller.

00:13:03.190 --> 00:13:05.129
Our script supervisor is Meredith Danko.

00:13:05.129 --> 00:13:06.760
The associate producer is Danica Johnson.

00:13:06.760 --> 00:13:10.220
The show is written by my high school history
teacher, Raoul Meyer, Rosianna Rojas, and

00:13:10.220 --> 00:13:11.220
myself.

00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:12.220
And our graphics team is Thought Café.

00:13:12.220 --> 00:13:14.009
Every week there’s a new caption to the
Libertage.

00:13:14.009 --> 00:13:17.290
You can suggest captions in comments where
you can also ask questions about today’s

00:13:17.290 --> 00:13:19.620
video that will be answered by our team of
historians.

00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.600
Thanks for watching Crash Course and as we
say in my hometown, don’t forget to be awesome.

00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.600
I’m gonna go this way, Stan, just kiiidding!

00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:25.069
