00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:02.290
Consider the graph
of the function

00:00:02.290 --> 00:00:05.220
f of x that passes through
three points as shown.

00:00:05.220 --> 00:00:07.800
So these are the three
points, and this curve in blue

00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:09.280
is f of x.

00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:12.610
Identify which of the
statements are true.

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:14.030
So they give us
these statements.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:14.530
Let's see.

00:00:14.530 --> 00:00:18.280
This first one says f of
negative a is less than 1

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.764
minus f of negative a over a.

00:00:19.764 --> 00:00:21.930
So this seems like some
type of a bizarre statement.

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:24.013
How are we able to figure
out whether this is true

00:00:24.013 --> 00:00:25.620
from this right over here?

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.290
So let's just go
piece by piece and see

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:29.420
if something starts
to make sense.

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:31.990
So f of negative a, where
do we see that here?

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:33.590
Well, this is f of negative a.

00:00:33.590 --> 00:00:36.750
This is the point x
equals negative a.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.460
So this is negative
a, and this is

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.220
y is equal to f of negative a.

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.450
So this is f of negative
a right over here.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:48.600
And what we know about
f of negative a, based

00:00:48.600 --> 00:00:50.710
on looking at this graph,
is that f of negative a

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:52.675
is between 0 and 1.

00:00:52.675 --> 00:00:53.550
So we can write that.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.580
0 is less than f of negative
a, which is less than 1.

00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:02.060
So that's all I can deduce
about f of negative a right

00:01:02.060 --> 00:01:03.740
from the get-go.

00:01:03.740 --> 00:01:05.840
Now let's look at this
crazy statement, 1

00:01:05.840 --> 00:01:10.970
minus f of negative a over a.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:12.281
What is this?

00:01:12.281 --> 00:01:13.780
Well, let's think
about what happens

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:15.770
if we take the
secant line, if we're

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.940
trying to find the slope
of the secant line,

00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:20.272
between this point
and this point,

00:01:20.272 --> 00:01:22.230
if we wanted to find the
average rate of change

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:24.990
between the point negative a,
f of negative a, and the point

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:25.760
0, 1.

00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.690
If this is our endpoint,
our change in y

00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.340
is going to be 1
minus f of negative a.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:41.130
So 1 minus f of negative a
is equal to our change in y.

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:48.230
And our change in x, going from
negative a to 0, so change in x

00:01:48.230 --> 00:01:52.120
is going to be equal to
0 minus negative a, which

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.340
is equal to positive a.

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.540
So this right over here
is essentially our change

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:59.320
in x over our change in y
from this point to this point.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:04.170
It is our average rate of change
from this point to this point.

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:06.196
So it is our average
rate of change,

00:02:06.196 --> 00:02:08.320
or you could say it's the
slope of the secant line.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.403
So the secant line would
look something like this.

00:02:15.019 --> 00:02:17.060
Slope of the secant line,
so this right over here

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:28.350
is slope of secant
line between from f

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:33.600
of negative a to 0 comma 1.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:36.090
So just looking at this
diagram right over here,

00:02:36.090 --> 00:02:38.175
what do we know
about this slope?

00:02:38.175 --> 00:02:40.050
And in particular, can
we make any statements

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:43.290
about that slope
relative to, say, 0 or 1

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:45.000
or anything like that?

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.730
Well, let's think about
what a line of slope 1

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:49.000
would look like.

00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.590
Well, a line of
slope 1, especially

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:52.631
one that went through this
point right over here,

00:02:52.631 --> 00:02:56.310
would look something like this.

00:02:56.310 --> 00:03:00.639
A line of slope 1 would
look something like this.

00:03:00.639 --> 00:03:02.430
So this line right over
here that I've just

00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:06.330
drawn that goes from
negative 1 comma 0 to 0, 1,

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:07.480
this has slope 1.

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.550
So this slope is equal to 1.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.860
So if this green line
has a slope of 1,

00:03:12.860 --> 00:03:14.510
does this blue
line have a slope--

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.160
it clearly has a
different slope.

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.960
Is that slope, is
this blue line steeper

00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:21.370
or less steep than
the green line?

00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:23.570
Well, it's pretty clear
that this secant line

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.930
is steeper than the green line.

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.570
It's increasing faster.

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:30.290
So it's going to
have a higher slope.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.850
So this, looking at
it from this diagram,

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:36.820
this blue line has a
slope higher than 1.

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:39.135
Or the slope of the secant
line from negative a, f

00:03:39.135 --> 00:03:41.090
of negative a, to
0 comma 1, that

00:03:41.090 --> 00:03:43.610
is going to be greater than 1.

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:46.215
So this thing right over
here is greater than 1.

00:03:46.215 --> 00:03:48.340
So we're able to deduce,
this thing right over here

00:03:48.340 --> 00:03:49.640
is less than 1.

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.420
This thing over here
is greater than 1.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:54.500
So this thing is
less than that thing.

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.565
So this must be true.

00:03:57.565 --> 00:03:58.690
Now let's look at this one.

00:03:58.690 --> 00:04:01.337
We're comparing the
slope of the secant line.

00:04:01.337 --> 00:04:03.170
We're comparing the
slope of the secant line

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:04.191
that we just looked at.

00:04:04.191 --> 00:04:05.940
So this is the same
value right over here.

00:04:05.940 --> 00:04:09.020
So we're comparing this
slope right over here,

00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:12.400
to what's this? f
of a minus 1 over a.

00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:15.600
Well, this is the slope
of this secant line,

00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.510
this is the slope
of this secant line

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:20.000
that I'm drawing in this--
let me do it in more contrast.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:21.920
Let me do it in orange.

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.830
That is the slope
of this secant line.

00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:32.040
So which one has a higher slope?

00:04:32.040 --> 00:04:34.230
Well, it's pretty clear
that the blue secant line

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:37.730
has a higher slope than
this orange secant line.

00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:39.960
But here, it's saying
that the blue's slope

00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:41.380
is lower than the orange.

00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:43.450
So this is not going to be true.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:45.690
So this is not true.

00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:49.370
Then finally, let's look at
this over here-- f of a minus f

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.770
of negative a over 2a.

00:04:52.770 --> 00:04:55.800
So this is the slope.

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.160
Let me draw this.

00:04:57.160 --> 00:04:59.910
So this right over
here, this is the slope

00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:03.130
of the secant line
between this point

00:05:03.130 --> 00:05:04.740
and this point right over here.

00:05:04.740 --> 00:05:07.820
Our change in y is f of
a minus f of negative a.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.050
Our change in x is a minus
negative a, which is 2a.

00:05:11.050 --> 00:05:13.460
So this is this secant
line right over here.

00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:15.310
So let me draw it.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:19.740
So this secant line
right over here,

00:05:19.740 --> 00:05:25.930
so they're comparing
that slope to this slope.

00:05:25.930 --> 00:05:29.520
f of a minus 1 is our change in
y, over a is our change in x.

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.049
So we're comparing it to
that one right over there.

00:05:32.049 --> 00:05:33.840
And you could immediately
eyeball this kind

00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:35.600
of brownish,
maroon-- I guess it's

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:39.370
kind of a brown color-- this
secant line that goes all

00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:42.730
the way from here to here is
clearly steeper than this one

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:43.440
right over here.

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.481
And we know that, that
the average rate of change

00:05:45.481 --> 00:05:47.210
from here to here is
going to be higher

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:49.330
than the average rate of change
from here to here, because

00:05:49.330 --> 00:05:50.890
at least from
negative a to 0, we

00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:52.910
were increasing at
a much faster rate.

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:54.590
And then we slowed
down to this rate.

00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:56.560
So the average over
the entire interval

00:05:56.560 --> 00:06:02.420
is definitely going to be more
than what we get from 0 to a.

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:04.640
So this one is also not true.

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.204
This has a higher-- we actually
know that this is false.

00:06:08.204 --> 00:06:09.620
Both of these would
have been true

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.254
if we swapped
these signs around,

00:06:11.254 --> 00:06:12.920
if this was a greater
than sign, if this

00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.270
was a greater than sign.

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:17.480
So this is the only
one that applies.
