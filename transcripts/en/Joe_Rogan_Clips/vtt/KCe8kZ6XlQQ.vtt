00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:02.570
The Joe Rogan experience.

2
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.120
<v 1>Sometimes you don't find someone for a long time and then when you do,</v>

3
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.600
it changes your whole life.
You find someone,

4
00:00:12.601 --> 00:00:16.800
maybe it's just a youtube video and it's you saying it's still your

5
00:00:16.801 --> 00:00:21.180
motherfucking set and it's you just pushing people and telling people to go get

6
00:00:21.181 --> 00:00:25.650
after it and people see that and all of a sudden it's like they get goosebumps.

7
00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:29.190
Their heart starts racing.
It's like you gave them a drug,

8
00:00:29.191 --> 00:00:32.760
like you gave them fuel and then then they want to change their life and then

9
00:00:32.761 --> 00:00:34.860
they want to watch you tomorrow and then they want to watch you when they're at

10
00:00:34.861 --> 00:00:35.850
lunch break.
They're going to want you,

11
00:00:35.860 --> 00:00:38.430
they're taking a shit in other watch you on their phone,

12
00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:42.570
but that's this fuel and you literally can change a person's life through that

13
00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.810
because we need each other.
I mean this is,

14
00:00:45.811 --> 00:00:49.570
it's one more piece of evidence that we need each other.

15
00:00:49.570 --> 00:00:53.010
And then we have this sort of very strange,
loose,

16
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.190
fitted community of all human beings together.

17
00:00:56.860 --> 00:01:00.090
When someone like you does something that's exceptional and says something

18
00:01:00.091 --> 00:01:02.880
that's exceptional and has these inspirational words,

19
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:07.440
he can change a person's whole life,
changed their whole path,

20
00:01:07.441 --> 00:01:08.274
change who they are.

21
00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:12.840
I've gotten so many messages from people that say I lost 130 pounds.
You know,

22
00:01:12.841 --> 00:01:16.500
I did this,
I got off sugar.
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm,
I'm fucking running every day.

23
00:01:16.501 --> 00:01:20.310
I hit the gym five days a week.
Now I'm,
I'm a different person.

24
00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:24.690
I'm drinking water,
I'm exercise that,
I take vitamins,
I'm eating healthy,

25
00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:28.890
I've got more juice,
I've got more energy.
My whole life is different now.

26
00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:33.670
<v 0>I'm almost positive.
Yeah.
It happens all the time.
How does that make you feel?</v>

27
00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:39.420
Obligated,
you know?
No,
I didn't know.

28
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:43.780
What exactly do you feel like you have to kill?
You can't fail.

29
00:01:43.781 --> 00:01:45.040
You can't cause man,

30
00:01:45.041 --> 00:01:49.180
you got all these people looking up to you.

31
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:52.720
Yeah.
I don't want that.
I definitely don't want anybody looking up to me.

32
00:01:52.721 --> 00:01:57.640
But I do like people being inspired and if people get inspired by me,
I'm happy.

33
00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:03.100
But uh,
you know,
they do joke
and you can't help.

34
00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:07.180
You can't help.
But think I don't want it.
I mean,
I don't,

35
00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:12.040
I always say it all the time.
Yeah.
I'm no buddy.
I'm going way,
no,
look at me,
man.

36
00:02:12.041 --> 00:02:15.010
I'm looking at,
I talk about a higher power.
Look at the higher power,
man.

37
00:02:15.011 --> 00:02:18.130
Don't look at me.
We fucking need each other,
man.
We all need each other.

38
00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:21.840
We really do.
There's something beautiful about that though.
They like,

39
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.540
he can't just go it alone.
You really do need each other.

40
00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:28.510
And like if you accomplish everything you ever wanted to accomplish,

41
00:02:28.511 --> 00:02:31.120
but nobody's there for with you.
Nobody cares.

42
00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.890
Nobody likes you had told me and shit,
it's useless.
Absolutely.

43
00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:40.060
Like love is the most important thing.
And that sounds so cliche,

44
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:43.540
but without love,
it's all useless.
It's all useless.

45
00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.170
There's no personal satisfaction and accomplishments.
If nobody loves you,

46
00:02:47.530 --> 00:02:52.420
you're not going to enjoy it.
Yeah.
At least your family.
Yeah.
Yeah.
Everybody

47
00:02:52.420 --> 00:02:57.370
<v 1>good.
And the more you can spread positive energy,
the more people will love you,</v>

48
00:02:57.371 --> 00:03:00.630
the more you'll have that community of,
you know,
that's,

49
00:03:01.320 --> 00:03:05.070
<v 0>that's what I was just like,
I tell you to and ever expect to even,
you know,</v>

50
00:03:05.071 --> 00:03:10.071
live past 40 I people I always think about I'm here.

51
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:14.810
I'm the little kid that used to,
um,

52
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:18.160
hide in the closet when I,

53
00:03:18.300 --> 00:03:23.300
I would hear my dad's keys rattling the door or pointless car pull up in the

54
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:26.980
alley behind the calls that are trying to hide me.
And I just,
I didn't want,

55
00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.260
I didn't want him to see me,
one of them just,
I'm that kid,
dude.

56
00:03:31.261 --> 00:03:35.430
I'm so,
and my dad would always tell me that,
you know,

57
00:03:35.431 --> 00:03:38.570
you're never going to be nothing.
You're never going to do good.
You never go.

58
00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:43.400
And so I'm that kid.
So that's still fucks with you owe it to come from,
no,

59
00:03:43.670 --> 00:03:46.580
it,
I'm reminded of it.
I read,

60
00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:50.760
I think about that when people tell me all your grades CT or you ever,

61
00:03:51.510 --> 00:03:56.050
Oh man,
I'm,
I'm,
I come from,
I'm you man.
I,

62
00:03:56.060 --> 00:04:00.660
I wash dishes,
I cut grass,
I pump gas.

63
00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:06.060
Um,
those people,
you know,
I bust tables as a kid.

64
00:04:06.061 --> 00:04:08.520
I was,
I loved it.
All those things.
Yeah.
Yeah.

65
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.270
Though I'm throwing out the people that are saying that I'm great.

66
00:04:12.271 --> 00:04:16.500
I'm my own man.
I'm you.
Yeah.
Yeah.
I'm you.
I'm not,

67
00:04:16.501 --> 00:04:19.830
I'm not anything other than you.
That's so important.
Yeah.

68
00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:24.120
<v 1>Yeah.
They are you.
But that they can be someone like youtube.</v>

69
00:04:24.121 --> 00:04:27.390
They put in the kind of time and effort that you put in.
That's the real message.

70
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.470
The real messages.
We all started from nowhere.
I mean,
we all had bullshit jobs.

71
00:04:31.471 --> 00:04:36.330
We all felt like losers.
But through time and effort,

72
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:41.250
you build a stronger human.
You build a stronger body,
you build a stronger mind.

73
00:04:41.251 --> 00:04:43.950
You build accomplishments and we'll,
and momentum,

74
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:48.300
and then you look back and you go,
hey man,
I'm not washing tables anymore.

75
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:52.320
You know,
I'm not a,
I'm not washing dishes.
I'm not cutting lawns.

76
00:04:52.321 --> 00:04:56.730
I'm not digging ditches.
I'm a different person now.
But I used to be

77
00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:01.940
<v 0>entity's desire not to be there for an actress.
That's what the,</v>

78
00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.170
<v 1>that's the hardest part,
right?</v>

79
00:05:03.171 --> 00:05:06.830
It's to get out of that Rut when you ain't got shit and there's nothing going
on.

80
00:05:07.100 --> 00:05:10.730
To have faith then is so difficult to have faith when you're successful.

81
00:05:10.731 --> 00:05:13.360
It's like,
yeah,
yeah.
It was a vet.
She had been successful for a walk.

82
00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:17.540
Once you got faith,
just keep doing what you're doing is absolutely right.

83
00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:20.940
It's like you already got up the hill.
Now you're just coasting.

84
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:26.030
You're just rolling down the hill.
Everything's great as the all smooth sailing.

85
00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.540
The hard part's getting up that fucking hill,

86
00:05:28.541 --> 00:05:30.980
and especially if you've got a dad you're hiding from,

87
00:05:30.981 --> 00:05:33.560
especially if you feel like you're a loser.

88
00:05:33.561 --> 00:05:36.200
You're never really had anything in your life that you could look back on and

89
00:05:36.201 --> 00:05:38.450
say,
hey,
I was really good at that.
You know,

90
00:05:38.451 --> 00:05:40.460
and that's a lot of people out there listening to this.

91
00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.640
There's so many people that are in that,
that starting point,

92
00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:47.000
like the people that come up to you and say,
what do I,
I don't know what to do.

93
00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.850
What should I do?
How do I do it?
How do I get going?

94
00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.850
But you're going to have to figure it out one foot in front of the other.

95
00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.780
You're going to have to have to find a thing and keep working at it and get

96
00:05:56.781 --> 00:06:00.110
better it.
That's one of the things that I liked so much about martial arts,

97
00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:04.280
to let anybody in anybody in and then from that,

98
00:06:04.370 --> 00:06:08.060
from learning how to do that,
you get better and then you realize it's,

99
00:06:08.061 --> 00:06:12.470
am I going to get better at anything because it's so the first time I ever did

100
00:06:12.471 --> 00:06:15.290
you do.
So I remember just being manhandled.
So bad going,
man,

101
00:06:15.291 --> 00:06:17.540
I'll never be good at this.
This is terrible.

102
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.360
I'm fucking awful at this and this is,

103
00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.940
I had already been a black belt in taekwondo and I already kickboxer and did a

104
00:06:22.941 --> 00:06:26.000
bunch of shit and I was like,
I can't believe I'm starting from scratch again.

105
00:06:26.600 --> 00:06:31.490
But that at least I knew then that I already done that before I'd already

106
00:06:31.491 --> 00:06:35.450
started from scratch.
So I had some experience and started from scratch.
I'm like,

107
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:40.280
Oh,
I have to do is just put in the time and the effort here to get better.
Damn,

108
00:06:40.281 --> 00:06:42.830
that's for everybody.
Just find a thing,
everything.

109
00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:45.950
And if you find a thing like a particularly martial arts,

110
00:06:45.951 --> 00:06:49.730
because you get belts and ranks and then you could see how you're doing with

111
00:06:49.731 --> 00:06:51.660
opponents,
especially Jujitsu.

112
00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:54.310
I liked that when the bolt's cause you don't get in Hit,
you know,

113
00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:55.800
I think there's so many people that in,

114
00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:58.790
especially if you go to a bad gym in the early days,

115
00:06:58.791 --> 00:07:02.030
people are going to tune tune you up,
they're going to beat you up.

116
00:07:03.170 --> 00:07:06.650
You could get some real damage would be scourged lot of people.
Yeah.

117
00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:09.890
But if you could just find a thing and work hard at that thing,

118
00:07:09.891 --> 00:07:14.570
you'll realize through that thing that you can get good at anything with time

119
00:07:14.571 --> 00:07:15.350
and effort.

120
00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.950
<v 0>Don't have anything with that.
I mean,
if you pick the thing,
yeah.
Pick thing,</v>

121
00:07:19.090 --> 00:07:23.140
pick up calls to you,
whatever calls to you.
Yep.

122
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:27.010
They decide to change to,
to,
to not,
uh,

123
00:07:27.490 --> 00:07:31.960
to change those circumstances,
whatever they might be.
Yeah.
As long as you have,

124
00:07:32.050 --> 00:07:36.280
you have to have that.
These are the will to change their circumstances.

125
00:07:36.550 --> 00:07:40.010
That's actually start right there,
man.
Yeah.
How bleak it mixing,

126
00:07:40.130 --> 00:07:43.410
but if you have the will,
the desire to change it,

127
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:45.320
they are just starting point.
