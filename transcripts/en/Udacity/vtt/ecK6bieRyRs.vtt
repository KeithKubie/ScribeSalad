00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000
This is where the difference between physical and web/mobile channels first come into play

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
because the MVP for a physical channel that is something you sell directly through stores

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
under the direct sales force is very different than something that you might be building

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:18.000
for the web or even more so for a mobile channel.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000
So in a physical channel, what you really want to have is something that customers can touch

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
and feel because you're going to be out talking to them and while you could certainly go out

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:30.000
with a PowerPoint deck with a photo of what the product's going to look like, etc.,

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
my advice always is invest a day or two in building something even if it's out of Styrofoam

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and cardboard or if it's something as small as a chip or a microphotograph

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
or a microphotograph of a proposed die layout.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.000
That is almost for any physical product you should probably be going out

00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
and trying to get some reaction based on something that people could see and touch.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
And in doing that, you're going to test your understanding of the problem,

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
test your understanding of the solution, and when you do that it's going to prove

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000
that it solves the core problem of the customers.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:08.000
And you're going to learn what the minimum set of features are from the early evangelists.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000
In a physical channel, this requires lots of interviews, demos, and prototypes

00:01:14.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and lots of eyeball of contacts.
