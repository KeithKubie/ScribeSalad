10 Ways to Tell You've Ticked Off an Introvert

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:19.599
We all agree that we shouldn't tick off introverts. We've all done it

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:25.929
Especially family and friends. The problem is knowing when you've ticked them off. Why should this even matter to you?

00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:30.160
Because if you tick off an introvert, you've made an enemy for life.

00:00:30.619 --> 00:00:37.929
Although not as verbal or out there as their angry (?) extroverts, introverts usually are more dangerous because they don't wear their hearts on their sleeves.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:46.720
If you're an introvert, you'll recognize some of these signs. If your family or friends of an introvert, you'll remember these signs from past incidences

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.580
Here are ten subtle signs that you've ticked off an introvert

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:57.800
Number one: the introvert responds with one word. Think yes; no; fine, etc.

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.280
Unlike extroverts who let the whole world know exactly how they're feeling,

00:01:02.289 --> 00:01:03.000
[mumble] Anger..

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:06.699
Introverts shut down and resort to one word sentences

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:09.399
One word answers help them in two ways:

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:16.040
1. One word answers stop people pestering them by asking what's wrong. If they don't respond and

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.400
2. One-Word answers mean go away

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:26.880
You may not see it as anger as the introvert maybe almost emotionless as they tell you off or fake happiness with their one-word answers

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:33.339
2. The introvert doesn't answer your calls. This is simply known as the silent treatment

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:38.260
While extroverts want to shout your ear off, letting you know exactly how you messed up

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:44.830
Introverts, don't want to deal with you at all because you stress them out. They want nothing to do with you and will avoid speaking

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:47.949
To you face-to-face or over the phone at all costs

00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:54.060
They cut you out of their life until they've forgiven you or gotten over whatever you did to cause them to go silent on

00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.660
3. The Introvert pretends everything is okay

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:05.460
This is a classic one because they use this to completely avoid the situation altogether and combine this reaction with one-word answers

00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.510
Passive-Aggressive behavior is a Hallmark of Introverted behavior

00:02:10.270 --> 00:02:15.689
Introverts would rather fake smile, interact with you as little as possible, and get the hell away from you pronto

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:17.530
the hate confrontation

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:24.040
and would rather be polite and leave then say their peace and have their energy drained from trying to resolve the matter

00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.020
4. The Introvert blows up over small things

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:35.880
Introverts naturally bottle up their feelings. However, even they have their limits. You could be the unfortunate one that pushes their button

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:40.140
One minute, they're fine, the next they're screaming their lungs at you

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:46.559
What's important to note about this burst of anger is that it's been bubbling under the surface for a long time

00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:50.850
It may appear to come from nowhere and could be over something trivial

00:02:50.850 --> 00:02:55.360
But this is not the case. The introvert has reached their limit.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.720
5. The introvert refuses help

00:02:58.140 --> 00:03:03.800
Typically introverts refuse help from anyone, even well-meaning friends and family simply because they love going it alone

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:08.339
They will, however, accept help from those who they tolerate or admire

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:15.160
You'll know for a fact that you've messed up with an introvert when they refuse your help even when there's no legitimate reason for them

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.200
to do so

00:03:16.209 --> 00:03:22.019
Even if they desperately need your help, they'll refuse because they don't want to be infected by your presence

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:27.239
For example, if you were to try to help an introvert to the ambulance after they sprained their ankle

00:03:27.459 --> 00:03:30.329
They might shrug you off and limp to the ambulance on their own

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:34.980
6. Apathy

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:40.820
Some introverts use this as a way to shut down. Their calm exterior nature hides their fiery anger inside

00:03:41.620 --> 00:03:44.340
They just don't care about anything

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:49.860
Things they were enthusiastic about become all of a sudden unimportant and "whatever" becomes their favorite new [word?]

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:54.300
You know for sure they're apathetic to you if you're the only one affected by it

00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.100
because they don't like being verbal which would lead to social interaction and having to reveal their interactions

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:07.400
Introverts will be apathetic to you in a "I'm angry" or "Something's wrong" kind of way without saying it

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:10.940
Their actions will say the complete opposite

00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:13.340
7. The introvert retreats into their work

00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:20.600
This is a sure sign introverts are MAJORLY ticked off at you. They are quite happy to dive into work,  and drown in it

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:26.970
and see it as a welcome escape, especially from someone has ticked them off. In the workplace, for example, you'd see it by the way

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:31.020
they've canceled a lunch date with you because they've got "too much work to do".

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:34.280
At school, they stopped hanging out with you because they've "got too much homework"

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.820
In relationships, it could be an excuse like "I have to work late tonight"

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.860
It's their way of saying they don't need you and have better things to do. They're just using an excuse to do so

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:49.380
8. The Introvert only wants to communicate by text or email

00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:56.489
There are introverts that avoid talking to someone they hate at all costs, and get frustrated if they have to hear said person's voice

00:04:57.730 --> 00:05:01.469
Thanks to the digital age, communication can be kept to email and texting

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:04.289
Say you call an introvert and leave a message

00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.669
They'll respond to the message when they could have answered the phone, but they chose not to

00:05:09.730 --> 00:05:15.539
They could also offer up lame excuses about why they didn't answer the phone, like, "I just got out of the shower" or

00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.730
"Sorry, my phone was on silent"

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.480
If this happens continuously, and not occasionally, then you've rubbed the introvert on the wrong side

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:29.740
9. The introvert seems to treat your pets better than you...

00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:31.400
Ouch.....

00:05:31.860 --> 00:05:35.060
Introverts and animals get along better than introverts and humans at times

00:05:35.919 --> 00:05:41.039
Animals don't expect much from you in the form of conversation, and are happy sitting in silence, enjoying your company

00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.039
Let's say you have a pet and your introvert friend comes over. If they pay more attention to your pet

00:05:47.350 --> 00:05:53.399
Avoiding eye contact with you, or not in a bored manner about what you're saying, then you've definitely annoyed them

00:05:53.979 --> 00:05:55.979
They'll even say more to your pet than you

00:05:57.229 --> 00:05:59.439
10. The Introvert wants to be alone

00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:04.869
Nothing says "leave me alone" like an introvert isolating themselves from others

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.459
Alone time is essential for an introvert to recharge and distress

00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.539
This is a tough one because you don't know whether the introvert wants to be alone

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:17.240
Because you've ticked them off, or if everything around them is ticking them off?

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:22.360
If you want to know for sure whether you're the problem, watch how they react in a group of people

00:06:22.729 --> 00:06:27.339
If you come on the scene and all of a sudden they want to leave, and left before you can even say "hi",

00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:34.840
Then it's you buddy. How's that for 10 signs you've ticked off an introvert? Did you recognize some of them, or were some new?
