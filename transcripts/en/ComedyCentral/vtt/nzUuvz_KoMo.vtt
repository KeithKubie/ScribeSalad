00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.103
(rock music)

00:00:07.107 --> 00:00:10.310
- Do you watch Toddlers and
Tiaras, does anybody watch that?

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:11.144
Yeah?

00:00:11.144 --> 00:00:12.078
(cheering)

00:00:12.078 --> 00:00:13.980
It's about the child pageants.

00:00:13.980 --> 00:00:15.915
Which is a very American
thing, child beauty pageants.

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.651
Is anybody not from
America at all in here?

00:00:18.651 --> 00:00:19.486
One of you?

00:00:19.486 --> 00:00:20.720
Are you all American?

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.789
'Cause I'd explain
it in Canada people,

00:00:22.789 --> 00:00:25.191
'cause they don't like,
they don't know what it is.

00:00:25.191 --> 00:00:26.326
They don't do that.

00:00:26.326 --> 00:00:28.061
So you have to
explain to foreigners.

00:00:28.061 --> 00:00:28.995
(laughter)

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:31.898
Okay, look, here's what it is.

00:00:31.898 --> 00:00:35.068
In America, we have
beautiful children

00:00:39.773 --> 00:00:42.409
so, yeah there you go.

00:00:42.409 --> 00:00:43.977
(laughter)

00:00:43.977 --> 00:00:45.245
We have to have a contest
because we have hot kids,

00:00:45.245 --> 00:00:47.213
I don't know, what do
you want me to tell you?

00:00:47.213 --> 00:00:49.916
Sorry if you're not going
through the same thing.

00:00:49.916 --> 00:00:50.750
(beaver squeals)

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.285
(laughter)

00:00:52.285 --> 00:00:54.988
Hey, sorry to hear about your
unfuckable children Canada.

00:00:54.988 --> 00:00:55.955
(laughter)

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.123
We got to live our lives.

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.359
(laughter)

00:01:00.794 --> 00:01:03.930
It is weird though, and so
this one mom got in trouble

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.101
because she put big fake tits
on her five year old daughter.

00:01:08.101 --> 00:01:09.302
(laughter)

00:01:09.302 --> 00:01:10.403
Well it was for the
talent part of the show.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.704
(laughter)

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:13.807
She didn't have a talent.

00:01:14.641 --> 00:01:16.276
Quick, we need a talent.

00:01:16.276 --> 00:01:17.877
Big fake tits and
a big fake ass,

00:01:17.877 --> 00:01:19.612
and she comes out and
does a booty ass for the

00:01:19.612 --> 00:01:22.215
And she got in legal trouble.

00:01:22.215 --> 00:01:24.117
She might lose custody of
her daughter for that now.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:26.986
Which is so unfair, because
that woman is genius.

00:01:26.986 --> 00:01:28.855
That's really, that's
the most amazing

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.723
thing I've ever heard of.

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:32.592
Tits on a five year
old at a pageant?

00:01:32.592 --> 00:01:33.827
(laughter)

00:01:33.827 --> 00:01:34.761
You've never thought
of anything that good

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:35.662
in your whole life dude.

00:01:35.662 --> 00:01:36.896
(laughter)

00:01:36.896 --> 00:01:40.667
You've never once had
an idea that good, ever.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.735
What's the big fear
about these pageants?

00:01:42.735 --> 00:01:45.572
It's pedophiles,
pedophiles right?

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.842
So what better way to hide
your child from a pedophile

00:01:48.842 --> 00:01:50.110
(laughter)

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.379
than to disguise her
as a voluptuous lady.

00:01:54.647 --> 00:01:56.282
(laughter)

00:01:56.282 --> 00:01:59.385
That is, they don't
want to see that!

00:02:00.987 --> 00:02:02.489
Big ass titties!

00:02:02.489 --> 00:02:03.323
(applause)

00:02:03.323 --> 00:02:05.825
Pedophiles hate that.

00:02:05.825 --> 00:02:07.794
That's like ruining the whole
point of being a pedophile.

00:02:07.794 --> 00:02:09.662
(laughter)

00:02:09.662 --> 00:02:14.300
I bet every pedophile left
that pageant in disgust.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.436
Shame on you ma'am.

00:02:16.436 --> 00:02:18.805
(laughter)

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.642
That is a child, a
beautiful, beautiful child.

00:02:27.914 --> 00:02:29.315
That's gross.

00:02:29.315 --> 00:02:31.484
But that's what a
pedophile says, you know.

00:02:31.484 --> 00:02:32.585
That's not me saying that.

00:02:32.585 --> 00:02:33.987
That's what a
pedophile says, I don't

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:35.355
say things like that.

00:02:35.355 --> 00:02:36.956
I'm like, Hey,
let's get some tits

00:02:36.956 --> 00:02:38.858
on this kid and
get her out there.

00:02:38.858 --> 00:02:39.759
See what she can do.

00:02:39.759 --> 00:02:40.927
(laughter)

00:02:40.927 --> 00:02:43.363
I'm like the opposite
of a pedophile.

00:02:43.363 --> 00:02:44.898
I like kids with fat tits.

00:02:44.898 --> 00:02:48.968
I'm not going to apologize
for not being a pedophile.

00:02:51.404 --> 00:02:53.940
Do you ever watch
the adult pageants?

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.275
Adult beauty pageants?

00:02:55.275 --> 00:02:56.309
But just when they
have to answer

00:02:56.309 --> 00:02:58.778
questions, and they sound dumb?

00:02:58.778 --> 00:03:02.081
Yeah, that's mean, that's
mean, you're mean to do that.

00:03:02.081 --> 00:03:04.984
Remember Miss Utah, who was
on YouTube just recently?

00:03:04.984 --> 00:03:07.487
'Cause she answered,
they asked her a question

00:03:07.487 --> 00:03:09.255
and she said, Women
need to do more better.

00:03:09.255 --> 00:03:11.191
Something like that.

00:03:11.191 --> 00:03:12.458
Everybody was making fun of her.

00:03:12.458 --> 00:03:14.027
And women do need
to do more better.

00:03:14.027 --> 00:03:15.128
She's not wrong.

00:03:15.128 --> 00:03:16.362
(laughter)

00:03:16.362 --> 00:03:18.965
You don't need to
do more better?

00:03:18.965 --> 00:03:21.968
But, why would you
ask those questions

00:03:21.968 --> 00:03:23.436
at a beauty pageant?

00:03:23.436 --> 00:03:26.706
Why are there smarty pants
questions at a pretty contest?

00:03:26.706 --> 00:03:29.342
I think that is the question.

00:03:29.342 --> 00:03:30.376
That's not fair.

00:03:30.376 --> 00:03:31.878
What's the point of

00:03:31.878 --> 00:03:34.480
having fake tits if I have to
know things on top of that?

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.517
You can tell me what
that money's for.

00:03:37.517 --> 00:03:40.787
You can't just be a
specialist, that's not allowed?

00:03:40.787 --> 00:03:41.921
That's not fair.

00:03:41.921 --> 00:03:43.156
(laughter)

00:03:43.156 --> 00:03:46.626
That's like if you took
Supreme Court Justice

00:03:46.626 --> 00:03:48.661
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,
that is the second woman

00:03:48.661 --> 00:03:51.331
in history ever nominated
to the Supreme Court.

00:03:51.331 --> 00:03:53.099
That's a very high achievement.

00:03:53.099 --> 00:03:55.368
And she's a role
model for girls, okay?

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:59.706
And if at the hearing,
Okay Ruth Bader Ginsburg,

00:03:59.706 --> 00:04:02.208
great legal answers, great job.

00:04:03.309 --> 00:04:04.410
But now we are coming
to the swimsuit

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:07.480
portion of the confirmation.

00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:09.849
So you're going to have
to put this two-piece on.

00:04:09.849 --> 00:04:11.050
(laughter)

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:13.853
And let's see how
well rounded you are.

00:04:13.853 --> 00:04:16.689
Yeah, you know about
the law, woop de doo.

00:04:16.689 --> 00:04:19.559
She comes out all
nervous, kinda.

00:04:19.559 --> 00:04:22.061
And just point, yeah,
that's your beach body,

00:04:22.061 --> 00:04:23.730
Ruth Bader Ginsburg?

00:04:24.597 --> 00:04:25.531
Do you think you're going to be

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:27.200
a Justice with those tits?

00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.935
Is that what you thought?

00:04:28.935 --> 00:04:30.603
You're a role model.

00:04:33.339 --> 00:04:35.775
(rock music)
