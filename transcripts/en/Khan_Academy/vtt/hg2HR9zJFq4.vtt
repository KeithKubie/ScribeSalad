00:00:00.574 --> 00:00:03.480
- [Instructor] Consider the
following piecewise function

00:00:03.480 --> 00:00:05.918
and we say f(t) is equal to

00:00:05.918 --> 00:00:07.515
and they tell us what it's equal to

00:00:07.515 --> 00:00:09.401
based on what t is,

00:00:09.401 --> 00:00:10.924
so if t is less than or equal to -10,

00:00:10.924 --> 00:00:11.963
we use this case.

00:00:11.963 --> 00:00:13.969
If t is between -10 and -2,

00:00:13.969 --> 00:00:15.006
we use this case.

00:00:15.006 --> 00:00:17.083
And if t is greater than or equal to -2,

00:00:17.083 --> 00:00:18.737
we use this case.

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:19.570
And then they ask us

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.809
what is the value of f(-10)?

00:00:21.809 --> 00:00:23.766
So t is going to be equal to -10,

00:00:23.766 --> 00:00:25.810
so which case do we use?

00:00:25.810 --> 00:00:26.643
So let's see.

00:00:26.643 --> 00:00:29.345
If t is less than or equal to -10,

00:00:29.345 --> 00:00:31.374
we use this top case, right over here

00:00:31.374 --> 00:00:33.218
and t is equal to -10,

00:00:33.218 --> 00:00:34.839
that's the one that
we're trying to evaluate.

00:00:34.839 --> 00:00:38.334
So we wanna use this case right over here.

00:00:38.334 --> 00:00:42.501
So f(-10) is going to be equal to -10,

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:45.674
everywhere we see a t here,

00:00:45.674 --> 00:00:48.267
we substitute it with a -10.

00:00:48.267 --> 00:00:50.434
- 10 squared minus 5 times,

00:00:51.396 --> 00:00:52.942
actually I don't have a denominator there,

00:00:52.942 --> 00:00:54.498
I don't know why I wrote it so high.

00:00:54.498 --> 00:00:58.415
So it's gonna be -10
squared minus 5 times -10.

00:01:00.498 --> 00:01:01.331
So let's see.

00:01:01.331 --> 00:01:04.257
- 10 squared, that's positive 100

00:01:04.257 --> 00:01:05.295
and then negative,

00:01:05.295 --> 00:01:07.545
or subtracting 5 times -10,

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:11.376
this is going to be subtracting -50

00:01:11.376 --> 00:01:13.575
or you're going to add 50,

00:01:13.575 --> 00:01:16.232
so this is going to be equal to 150.

00:01:16.232 --> 00:01:18.942
f(10) is 150,

00:01:18.942 --> 00:01:20.317
'cause we used this case up here,

00:01:20.317 --> 00:01:21.650
'cause t is -10.

00:01:22.769 --> 00:01:25.174
Let's do another one of these examples.

00:01:25.174 --> 00:01:28.115
So, here we have

00:01:28.115 --> 00:01:30.592
consider the following
piecewise function, alright.

00:01:30.592 --> 00:01:32.944
What is the value of h(-3)?

00:01:32.944 --> 00:01:34.455
See when h is -3,

00:01:34.455 --> 00:01:36.304
which case do we use?

00:01:36.304 --> 00:01:41.175
We use this case if our x
is between negative infinity

00:01:41.175 --> 00:01:42.643
and zero.

00:01:42.643 --> 00:01:46.288
And -3 is in between
negative infinity and zero,

00:01:46.288 --> 00:01:48.783
so we're gonna use this
case right over here.

00:01:48.783 --> 00:01:50.153
If it was positive three,

00:01:50.153 --> 00:01:51.525
we would use this case.

00:01:51.525 --> 00:01:52.602
If it was positive 30,

00:01:52.602 --> 00:01:54.228
we would use this case.

00:01:54.228 --> 00:01:57.124
So we're going to use the first case again

00:01:57.124 --> 00:01:59.957
and so for h(-3),

00:02:00.794 --> 00:02:03.018
we're gonna take -3 to the third power.

00:02:03.018 --> 00:02:03.851
So let's see.

00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:08.445
h(-3) is going to be -3 to the third power

00:02:08.445 --> 00:02:09.528
which is -27.

00:02:11.828 --> 00:02:12.661
And we're done.

00:02:12.661 --> 00:02:14.602
That's h(-3).

00:02:14.602 --> 00:02:15.599
Because we're using this case,

00:02:15.599 --> 00:02:17.779
you could almost ignore
these second two cases

00:02:17.779 --> 00:02:19.161
right over here.

00:02:19.161 --> 00:02:20.805
Let's do one more example.

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:22.981
This one's a little bit different.

00:02:22.981 --> 00:02:26.819
Below is a graph of the step function g(x)

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:28.964
so we can see g(x) right over here.

00:02:28.964 --> 00:02:31.504
It starts when x equals -9, it's at 3,

00:02:31.504 --> 00:02:32.342
and then it jumps up,

00:02:32.342 --> 00:02:33.667
and then it jumps down.

00:02:33.667 --> 00:02:36.409
Match each expression with its value.

00:02:36.409 --> 00:02:38.992
So g(-3.0001),

00:02:40.436 --> 00:02:42.936
so -3.0001,

00:02:44.017 --> 00:02:45.854
so that's right over here

00:02:45.854 --> 00:02:47.177
and g of that,

00:02:47.177 --> 00:02:48.927
we see is equal to 3.

00:02:50.251 --> 00:02:54.073
So this is going to be
equal to 3 right over here.

00:02:54.073 --> 00:02:57.113
g(3.99999)

00:02:57.113 --> 00:03:01.676
3.99999, almost 4,

00:03:01.676 --> 00:03:04.473
so let's draw a dotted line right here,

00:03:04.473 --> 00:03:06.312
it's gonna be almost 4,

00:03:06.312 --> 00:03:10.394
well g(3.99999) is going to be 7.

00:03:10.394 --> 00:03:12.417
We see that right over there.

00:03:12.417 --> 00:03:14.437
So that is equal to 7.

00:03:14.437 --> 00:03:17.303
g(4.00001).

00:03:17.303 --> 00:03:19.887
So g(4) is still 7,

00:03:19.887 --> 00:03:22.656
but as soon as we go above 4,

00:03:22.656 --> 00:03:24.114
we drop down over here,

00:03:24.114 --> 00:03:28.197
so g(4.00001) is going to be -3.

00:03:29.961 --> 00:03:32.402
I wanna, actually, let's focus
on that a little bit more.

00:03:32.402 --> 00:03:33.922
How did I know that?

00:03:33.922 --> 00:03:37.303
Well I know that g(4) is 7 and not -3

00:03:37.303 --> 00:03:40.280
because we have this dot
is circled in up here

00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:41.919
and it's hollow down here.

00:03:41.919 --> 00:03:44.873
But as soon as we get
any amount larger than 4,

00:03:44.873 --> 00:03:46.854
then the function drops down to this.

00:03:46.854 --> 00:03:49.183
So 4.0000, as many,

00:03:49.183 --> 00:03:50.690
just slightly above 4,

00:03:50.690 --> 00:03:53.844
the value of our function
is going to be -3.

00:03:53.844 --> 00:03:55.991
Now let's do g(9).

00:03:55.991 --> 00:03:58.287
So g(9), that's when x is 9

00:03:58.287 --> 00:03:59.423
and we go down here.

00:03:59.423 --> 00:04:01.289
You might be tempted to say it's -3,

00:04:01.289 --> 00:04:03.036
but you see, at this
point right over here,

00:04:03.036 --> 00:04:05.058
we have an open circle.

00:04:05.058 --> 00:04:06.792
So that means that while it's not,

00:04:06.792 --> 00:04:10.147
you can't say that the
function is -3 right over there

00:04:10.147 --> 00:04:12.779
and there's no other place
where we have a filled-in circle

00:04:12.779 --> 00:04:14.549
for x equals 9

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:18.895
so the function g actually
isn't defined at x equals 9.

00:04:18.895 --> 00:04:22.645
So I'm gonna put undefined
right over there.
