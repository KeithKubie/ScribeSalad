00:00:01.241 --> 00:00:02.386
- [Voiceover] How do you describe rotation

00:00:02.386 --> 00:00:04.076
in three dimensions?

00:00:04.076 --> 00:00:06.266
So for example, I have here a globe

00:00:06.266 --> 00:00:07.915
and it's rotating in some way

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:09.866
and there's a certain
direction that it's rotating

00:00:09.866 --> 00:00:11.747
and a speed with which it's rotating.

00:00:11.747 --> 00:00:14.277
And the question is how could
you give me some numerical

00:00:14.277 --> 00:00:17.694
information that perfectly
describes that rotation?

00:00:17.694 --> 00:00:20.199
So you give me some numbers,
and I can tell you the speed

00:00:20.199 --> 00:00:21.871
and the direction and
everything associated

00:00:21.871 --> 00:00:23.708
with this rotation.

00:00:23.708 --> 00:00:24.999
But before talking about that,

00:00:24.999 --> 00:00:26.654
let's remind ourselves
of how we talked about

00:00:26.654 --> 00:00:28.209
two dimensional rotation.

00:00:28.209 --> 00:00:30.033
So I have here a little pi creature,

00:00:30.033 --> 00:00:32.510
and I set him to start rotating about

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:34.154
and the way that we can describe this,

00:00:34.154 --> 00:00:36.833
we pretty much need to
just give a rate to it.

00:00:36.833 --> 00:00:41.000
And you might give that rate
as a number of rotations

00:00:42.711 --> 00:00:47.233
per second, some unit of
time. So rotations per second.

00:00:47.233 --> 00:00:49.943
And in this case, I think
I programmed him so that

00:00:49.943 --> 00:00:53.194
he's going to do one rotation
for every five seconds.

00:00:53.194 --> 00:00:56.244
So his rotational rate would be 0.2.

00:00:56.244 --> 00:00:57.676
But that's a little bit ambiguous

00:00:57.676 --> 00:00:59.557
because if you just say,
"Hey, this little pi creature

00:00:59.557 --> 00:01:02.111
is rotating at 0.2 rotations per second,"

00:01:02.111 --> 00:01:04.131
someone could say, "Well, is it clockwise

00:01:04.131 --> 00:01:05.705
or counterclockwise?"

00:01:05.705 --> 00:01:06.964
So there's some ambiguity.

00:01:06.964 --> 00:01:08.473
And the convention that
people have adopted

00:01:08.473 --> 00:01:10.911
is to say, "Well, if I
give you a positive number,

00:01:10.911 --> 00:01:13.279
if the number is positive,
then that's going to tell you

00:01:13.279 --> 00:01:17.268
that the nature of the
rotation is counterclockwise,

00:01:17.268 --> 00:01:18.620
but if I give you a negative number,

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:20.896
if instead you see something
that's a negative number

00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:22.776
of rotations per second,
that would be rotation

00:01:22.776 --> 00:01:25.007
the other way, going clockwise."

00:01:25.007 --> 00:01:26.910
And that's the convention.

00:01:26.910 --> 00:01:28.744
That's just what people have decided on.

00:01:28.744 --> 00:01:31.524
And with this it's very nice
because given a single number,

00:01:31.524 --> 00:01:33.434
just one number, and it could
be positive or negative,

00:01:33.434 --> 00:01:36.499
you can perfectly describe
two dimensional rotation.

00:01:36.499 --> 00:01:38.032
And there's a minor nuance here,

00:01:38.032 --> 00:01:40.513
usually in physics and
math, we don't actually use

00:01:40.513 --> 00:01:43.512
rotations per unit second but
instead you describe things

00:01:43.512 --> 00:01:47.679
in terms of the number of
radians per unit second.

00:01:49.005 --> 00:01:51.476
And just as a quick
reminder of what that means,

00:01:51.476 --> 00:01:53.589
if you imagine some kind of circle,

00:01:53.589 --> 00:01:55.726
and it could be any circle,
the size doesn't really matter,

00:01:55.726 --> 00:01:59.076
and if you draw the radius to
that and then ask the question

00:01:59.076 --> 00:02:01.530
how far along the circumference
would I have to go

00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:04.595
such that the arc length,
that sort of sub-portion

00:02:04.595 --> 00:02:07.452
of the circumference, is
exactly as long as the radius?

00:02:07.452 --> 00:02:11.003
So if this was R, you'd want
to know how far you have to go

00:02:11.003 --> 00:02:14.024
before that arc length is also R.

00:02:14.024 --> 00:02:16.826
And then that, that angle,
that amount of turning

00:02:16.826 --> 00:02:19.270
that you can do, determines one radian.

00:02:19.270 --> 00:02:21.244
And because there's exactly two pi radians

00:02:21.244 --> 00:02:24.502
for every rotation, to
convert between rotations

00:02:24.502 --> 00:02:25.912
per unit second and
radians per unit second,

00:02:25.912 --> 00:02:28.579
you just multiply this guy by 2π

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:33.279
so it would be whatever the
number you have there times 2π.

00:02:33.279 --> 00:02:34.874
And the specific numbers
aren't too important.

00:02:34.874 --> 00:02:38.247
The main upshot here is
that with a single number,

00:02:38.247 --> 00:02:40.192
positive or negative, you
can perfectly describe

00:02:40.192 --> 00:02:42.026
two dimensional rotation.

00:02:42.026 --> 00:02:43.811
But if we look over here at the 3D case,

00:02:43.811 --> 00:02:45.184
there's actually more information

00:02:45.184 --> 00:02:47.514
than just one number that
we're going to need to know.

00:02:47.514 --> 00:02:49.745
First of all, you want to know the axis

00:02:49.745 --> 00:02:52.197
around which it's rotating,
so the line that you can draw

00:02:52.197 --> 00:02:55.387
such that all rotation
happens around that line.

00:02:55.387 --> 00:02:57.351
And then you want to
describe the actual rate

00:02:57.351 --> 00:02:59.267
at which it's going. You
know, is it slow rotation

00:02:59.267 --> 00:03:00.254
or is it fast?

00:03:00.254 --> 00:03:03.743
So you need to know a direction
along with a magnitude.

00:03:03.743 --> 00:03:06.260
And you might say to yourself,
"Hey, direction? Magnitude?

00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:07.981
Sounds like we could use a vector."

00:03:07.981 --> 00:03:09.333
And in fact, that's what we do.

00:03:09.333 --> 00:03:11.755
We use some kind of vector whose length

00:03:11.755 --> 00:03:14.047
is going to correspond to the
rate at which it's rotating,

00:03:14.047 --> 00:03:15.741
typically in radians per second,

00:03:15.741 --> 00:03:17.367
it's called the angular velocity.

00:03:17.367 --> 00:03:21.999
And then the direction describes
the axis of rotation itself

00:03:21.999 --> 00:03:24.612
But similar to how in
two dimensions there was

00:03:24.612 --> 00:03:27.508
an ambiguity between clockwise
and counterclockwise,

00:03:27.508 --> 00:03:29.142
if this was the only convention we had,

00:03:29.142 --> 00:03:31.252
it would be ambiguous whether
you should use this vector

00:03:31.252 --> 00:03:35.040
or if you should use one pointing
in the opposite direction.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.965
And the way I've chosen to
draw these guys, by the way,

00:03:36.965 --> 00:03:38.311
it doesn't matter where they are,

00:03:38.311 --> 00:03:40.848
remember a vector it just has
a magnitude and a direction

00:03:40.848 --> 00:03:42.514
and you can put it anywhere in space.

00:03:42.514 --> 00:03:43.745
I figured it was natural enough

00:03:43.745 --> 00:03:45.301
to just kind of put them around the poles

00:03:45.301 --> 00:03:46.508
just so that you could see them

00:03:46.508 --> 00:03:48.505
on the axis of rotation itself.

00:03:48.505 --> 00:03:51.082
So the question is,
what vector do you use?

00:03:51.082 --> 00:03:52.963
Do you use the one
pointing in this direction?

00:03:52.963 --> 00:03:54.960
Or do you use this green one pointing

00:03:54.960 --> 00:03:56.237
in the opposite direction?

00:03:56.237 --> 00:03:57.630
And for this, we have a convention

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.325
known as the right-hand rule.

00:03:59.325 --> 00:04:01.048
So I'll go ahead and
bring in a picture here

00:04:01.048 --> 00:04:03.964
to illustrate the right-hand rule.

00:04:03.964 --> 00:04:06.005
What you imagine doing
is taking the fingers

00:04:06.005 --> 00:04:08.271
of your right hand and curling them around

00:04:08.271 --> 00:04:10.014
in the direction of rotation.

00:04:10.014 --> 00:04:11.516
And what I mean by that is
the tips of your fingers

00:04:11.516 --> 00:04:13.513
will be pointing the direction

00:04:13.513 --> 00:04:15.745
that the surface of the sphere would move.

00:04:15.745 --> 00:04:17.259
Then when you stick out your thumb,

00:04:17.259 --> 00:04:20.008
that's the direction that
is the choice of vector

00:04:20.008 --> 00:04:22.003
which should describe that rotation.

00:04:22.003 --> 00:04:23.757
So in the specific example we have here,

00:04:23.757 --> 00:04:25.506
when you stick out your right thumb,

00:04:25.506 --> 00:04:28.722
that corresponds to the white
vector, not the green one.

00:04:28.722 --> 00:04:30.765
But if you did things
the other way around,

00:04:30.765 --> 00:04:34.932
whoops, move this a little
bit. Get him to stay in place.

00:04:37.406 --> 00:04:39.008
If you move things the other way around,

00:04:39.008 --> 00:04:41.129
such that the rotation were going kind of

00:04:41.129 --> 00:04:42.538
in the opposite direction,

00:04:42.538 --> 00:04:45.417
then when you imagine curling
the fingers of your right hand

00:04:45.417 --> 00:04:47.855
around that direction, your
thumb is going to point

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:49.341
according to the green vector.

00:04:49.341 --> 00:04:53.477
But with the original rotation
that I started illustrating,

00:04:53.477 --> 00:04:54.594
it's the white vector,

00:04:54.594 --> 00:04:56.260
the white vector is the one to go with.

00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:57.498
And this is actually pretty cool, right?

00:04:57.498 --> 00:04:59.001
Because you're packing
a lot of information

00:04:59.001 --> 00:05:00.208
into that vector.

00:05:00.208 --> 00:05:02.007
It tells you what the axis is.

00:05:02.007 --> 00:05:05.250
It tells you the speed of
rotation via its magnitude.

00:05:05.250 --> 00:05:08.637
And then the choice of which
direction along the axis

00:05:08.637 --> 00:05:10.346
tells you whether the
globe is going one way

00:05:10.346 --> 00:05:11.516
or if it's going the other.

00:05:11.516 --> 00:05:12.816
So with just three numbers,

00:05:12.816 --> 00:05:15.510
the three dimensional
coordinates of this vector,

00:05:15.510 --> 00:05:17.739
you can perfectly describe any one given

00:05:17.739 --> 00:05:19.620
three dimensional rotation.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:22.267
And the reason I'm talking
about this, by the way,

00:05:22.267 --> 00:05:24.265
in a series of videos about curl,

00:05:24.265 --> 00:05:26.521
is because what I'm about to talk about

00:05:26.521 --> 00:05:29.867
is three dimensional curl
which relates to fluid flow

00:05:29.867 --> 00:05:32.506
in three dimensions and
how that induces a rotation

00:05:32.506 --> 00:05:34.272
at every single point in space.

00:05:34.272 --> 00:05:35.920
And what's going to happen
is you're going to associate

00:05:35.920 --> 00:05:38.366
a vector with every single point in space

00:05:38.366 --> 00:05:41.435
to answer the question
what rotation at that point

00:05:41.435 --> 00:05:43.769
is induced by the certain fluid flow?

00:05:43.769 --> 00:05:45.371
And I'm getting a little
bit ahead of myself here.

00:05:45.371 --> 00:05:46.810
For right now you just need to focus

00:05:46.810 --> 00:05:48.738
on a single point of rotation

00:05:48.738 --> 00:05:51.269
and a single vector corresponding to that.

00:05:51.269 --> 00:05:53.459
But it's important to kind
of get your head around

00:05:53.459 --> 00:05:55.889
how exactly we represent
this rotation with a vector

00:05:55.889 --> 00:06:00.464
before moving on to the notably
more cognitively intensive

00:06:00.464 --> 00:06:02.786
subject of three dimensional curl.

00:06:02.786 --> 00:06:05.710
So with that, I will see you next video.
