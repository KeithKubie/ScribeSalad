00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
I would say your counter hypothesis--the alternate hypothesis is p is smaller than 0.09,

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
and the reason why is I said the counter hypothesis if the medication

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
doesn't work as well as advertised.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:18.000
If I'd said it doesn't work as advertised and dropped the words as well, then this might be

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.000
the correct counter hypothesis, but those are hard as you analyze.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
In reality, you often have a suspicion that you're in a specific side of the null hypothesis.

00:00:26.000 --> 99:59:59.000
So this is the one to pick over here.
