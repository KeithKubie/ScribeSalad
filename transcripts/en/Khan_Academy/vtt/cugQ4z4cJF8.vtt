00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:04.820
In the last video I spoke a
bunch about the determining

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:08.590
factor on whether we have
inflation or deflation.

00:00:08.590 --> 00:00:10.860
It isn't so much the money
supply, although the money

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:14.450
supply will have an effect,
it's really capacity

00:00:14.450 --> 00:00:15.350
utilization.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:17.740
Capacity utilization is
driven by demand.

00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.550
And I made that distinction
because-- I gave that example

00:00:20.550 --> 00:00:23.100
of the island, where you could
have a very small money

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:26.990
supply, for example, one
seashell, but if the velocity

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:30.270
is really high, then people are
expressing that demand.

00:00:30.270 --> 00:00:32.409
And you'll have very high
utilization of all of the

00:00:32.409 --> 00:00:35.360
capacity in the island and you
might have inflation, even

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.640
though the money supply
is one seashell.

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:39.990
On the other hand, let's say, we
found a bunch of seashells,

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:42.920
but everyone stops transacting,
so the velocity

00:00:42.920 --> 00:00:44.430
were to slow down a bunch.

00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:47.960
So in that case, even though the
money supply is huge, or a

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.060
lot larger than it was, people
aren't expressing demand.

00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:53.550
So demand will be a lot
lower than capacity.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:58.610
As we showed in the cupcakes
economics video, when you have

00:00:58.610 --> 00:01:02.400
a lot of unused capacity, it's
everyone's incentive to try to

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:05.190
sell that extra unit and
they all lower prices.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:07.440
So you can have an increased
money supply but, if the

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:09.970
velocity slows down or if
demand is slowing down--

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:12.270
because that's what's causing
the velocity to slow down--

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.850
then you could still have a
deflationary situation.

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:19.350
Actually, we touched on the
chart where we showed that

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.030
every major inflationary bout
was actually stimulated, or

00:01:25.030 --> 00:01:28.705
was actually preceded, by a
pretty big upturn in capacity

00:01:28.705 --> 00:01:29.670
utilization.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:32.180
And the inflation really started
going once capacity

00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.430
utilization got into
the 80% range.

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:38.300
You could imagine that if, on
average, the world is running

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.610
at 80% that means that some
people are running at 70%,

00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:42.940
some people are running
at 90%, 95%.

00:01:42.940 --> 00:01:45.690
And those people who are running
at 95%, those are the

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.780
people who say, gee, instead of
trying to run at 96%, 97%,

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.970
98% utilization, why don't I
just raise price and not have

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.700
to worry about producing
that extra unit?

00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.720
And obviously their inputs go
into other people's; their

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.320
outputs go into other
people's inputs.

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.580
And then you get a generalized
price inflation.

00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.390
Now with that said, actually, I
want to make another point.

00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.400
In the early `70s-- everyone
always talks

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.620
about the oil shock.

00:02:08.620 --> 00:02:11.390
In 1973 you had the
Yom Kippur War.

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:14.790
We resupplied Israel, and then
you had all the OPEC countries

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.160
that essentially stopped selling
oil to the U.S. and a

00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.340
lot of other western nations.

00:02:19.340 --> 00:02:21.350
And people say, you know, oil
prices shot through the roof

00:02:21.350 --> 00:02:23.860
and that's what drove inflation,
that supply shock.

00:02:23.860 --> 00:02:29.050
That probably contributed
to it, but 1973 is

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:30.140
right around there.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.440
So if you actually look at this
chart, we're already kind

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.730
of on an inflationary
spectrum.

00:02:35.730 --> 00:02:37.800
The generalized prices were
already increasing.

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:40.640
And capacity utilization had
really preceded that.

00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:43.300
That probably just added
fuel to the flame.

00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:45.950
With that said, the question
that everyone's wondering

00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:48.620
about is, what's going
to happen now?

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:54.080
So before the current financial
crisis, we had a

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.330
certain amount of capacity.

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.660
Let's say this is everything,
this is the U.S. output.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.860
Let's say this is
U.S. GDP, right?

00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:12.930
GDP is just output.

00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:15.960
So in a normal developed
environment, so that you go

00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.810
back into the `60s-- and I
should probably get the

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:20.990
Bloomberg chart on this too,
because it's pretty

00:03:20.990 --> 00:03:31.750
interesting-- about 60% of our
GDP was on consumption.

00:03:31.750 --> 00:03:33.980
And consumption always
isn't a bad thing.

00:03:36.570 --> 00:03:38.420
Consumption isn't always
a bad thing.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.430
It's actually what
we use to have a

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:41.730
good standard of living.

00:03:41.730 --> 00:03:44.390
If I have a nice sofa, and a TV
set, and I go on vacations,

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:45.090
that's consumption.

00:03:45.090 --> 00:03:47.050
But it improves our standard of
living and the goal of all

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.040
countries is really
to improve that

00:03:49.040 --> 00:03:50.430
average standard of living.

00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:54.040
But the remainder is savings.

00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:58.440
In a traditionally responsible,
developed nation

00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.200
you save 40%, maybe 30% to
40%, depending on whether

00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:04.540
you're Japan or whether
you're Western Europe.

00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:08.410
Now what savings turns into, is
essentially new investment

00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:09.700
to raise your ouput.

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.690
So this savings is what allows
you to increase your output in

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:14.940
the next year.

00:04:22.670 --> 00:04:24.450
If you don't save even a little
bit, your output will

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:27.600
actually decrease, because no
one will invest in factories

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.550
and the factories will get old
and the roads will stop being

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.310
usable and all the rest.
Whenever someone's investing,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:36.660
that's someone else's savings.

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.940
And it's very important to
realize that investment and

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:41.230
savings are really two sides
of the same coin.

00:04:41.230 --> 00:04:43.020
If no one's saving, then
there's no money for

00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:43.780
investment.

00:04:43.780 --> 00:04:45.610
But just going back to this
example, when people are

00:04:45.610 --> 00:04:48.480
saving that's what not only
maintains output, but actually

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.120
increases total output.

00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:54.120
So this would be in the next
year or the next decade.

00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:59.370
And then, when we consume 60%
of this, we're consuming 60%

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.430
of a larger number and our
standard of living will go up.

00:05:01.430 --> 00:05:05.210
And this is a very sustainable
and good situation.

00:05:05.210 --> 00:05:09.320
What happened, unfortunately,
really since the early `80s,

00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:12.690
is that we had a constant
expansion of credit.

00:05:12.690 --> 00:05:15.690
We started lending more and
more money to everyone and

00:05:15.690 --> 00:05:17.150
other countries started
lending more and

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:18.150
more money to us.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.990
And most of that got expressed
in more and more consumption.

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:32.940
So if you look at U.S.
output-- This is GDP.

00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:37.550
If you actually go to 2007, the
average American consumed

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:39.120
more than we produced.

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:42.230
We had a negative savings.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:44.610
If I were to draw that,
it looks like this.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.020
In 2007, consumption was larger
than our total output.

00:05:56.800 --> 00:06:00.620
So the question is, how
did this happen?

00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:02.030
Everyone talks about money
and currencies.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:05.030
Essentially we borrowed output
from other people.

00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:09.270
When we borrow money from the
Chinese, which we use to buy

00:06:09.270 --> 00:06:12.860
their goods, we're essentially
just borrowing

00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:13.630
their output, right?

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:15.170
We're borrowing their goods.

00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:18.590
So when we give them a dollar
bill, that's a promise that,

00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.330
in the future, they could use
that dollar bill to come back

00:06:21.330 --> 00:06:23.040
and use some of our output.

00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.330
But over the course of the last
several decades, we were

00:06:25.330 --> 00:06:26.830
just borrowing other
people's output.

00:06:26.830 --> 00:06:28.370
And we became net debtors.

00:06:28.370 --> 00:06:30.060
So when your consumption is
actually larger than your

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:32.630
output, you immediately start
to realize that this isn't a

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:34.340
sustainable situation
for too long.

00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:36.470
And maybe we borrowed a little
bit more money and, actually

00:06:36.470 --> 00:06:39.770
it did turn out that way, that
we borrowed some people's

00:06:39.770 --> 00:06:43.320
output even more to fuel some
of our investment as well.

00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.860
It's not like no investment
was going on for

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:47.790
the last 20, 30 years.

00:06:47.790 --> 00:06:48.700
We had a lot of investment.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.080
But essentially, the consumption
and investment was

00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:55.200
being financed by other
people's output.

00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:58.440
And, of course, when you have
consumption touching up

00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.940
against-- you're fully utilized,
that makes it even

00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:02.870
more an incentive to invest.
So all of these people were

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:05.320
willing to invest in the U.S.

00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:08.650
What happened now is, you
realize that a lot of the

00:07:08.650 --> 00:07:12.230
financing or a lot of the debt
that was being taken on, it

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.270
was being facilitated by
people's homes and home equity

00:07:15.270 --> 00:07:16.820
loans but people really
aren't good for it.

00:07:16.820 --> 00:07:20.430
And now all of a sudden, the
banks dried up, liquidity is

00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:22.110
gone, people can't borrow
money, and you

00:07:22.110 --> 00:07:23.920
have a demand shock.

00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:26.630
So what you have is a situation
where a considerable

00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:30.030
amount of this consumption, and
actually a considerable

00:07:30.030 --> 00:07:33.570
amount of that investment that
was being fueled by financing,

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:35.580
disappears.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:37.820
And now that we're in a global
world, we really should think

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:38.760
about global output.

00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.300
But it doesn't matter,
we could talk

00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:41.490
about just U.S. output.

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.910
But now that this demand has
disappeared-- if this is U.S.

00:07:44.910 --> 00:07:48.180
output and let's say, this is
output that we were taking

00:07:48.180 --> 00:07:50.380
from China or Japan or wherever
else-- and our

00:07:50.380 --> 00:07:54.570
consumption has now
fallen down here.

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:56.420
And it's not because, all of a
sudden, people became prudent.

00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:58.360
It's because people aren't
willing to lend them, to go to

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.870
Williams-Sonoma and buy a $50
spatula or whatever else.

00:08:01.870 --> 00:08:04.200
They just can't get another
credit card loan or a home

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.060
equity loan.

00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:07.840
So you have the situation
now, where you have low

00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:08.740
utilization.

00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:10.780
And this comes back
to what we talked

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:11.970
about in the last video.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.280
That when you have low
utilization, it's everyone's

00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:16.150
incentive to lower prices.

00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:17.700
When you have a bunch
of vacant houses,

00:08:17.700 --> 00:08:18.890
people lower rents.

00:08:18.890 --> 00:08:21.150
When the car factories are
empty, people lower the price

00:08:21.150 --> 00:08:22.230
of car factories.

00:08:22.230 --> 00:08:26.620
When people are underutilized,
wages go down.

00:08:26.620 --> 00:08:30.610
You see this shock, more
recently, right here.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:34.480
As we said in the last video,
the orange line is U.S.

00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:35.960
capacity utilization.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:40.610
And it dropped from about
the 80% range.

00:08:40.610 --> 00:08:42.870
If it had gone up here, I would
have started getting

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.620
worried about hyperinflation.

00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:48.500
But, you see, right around
summer of 2007 it dropped off

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.870
of a cliff and it's down
here someplace.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.230
Now you see a little bit later,
inflation dropped.

00:08:53.230 --> 00:08:55.860
So that dynamic that we've been
talking about, capacity

00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.280
utilization falling off, because
we essentially had a

00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.310
demand shock.

00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.550
And then that's led to
a decrease in prices.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.110
So the question is, everything
that the Treasury is doing,

00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:08.870
and the Fed is printing money,
and Obama spending a

00:09:08.870 --> 00:09:10.300
trillion-dollar stimulus,
is that

00:09:10.300 --> 00:09:12.300
going to lead to inflation?

00:09:12.300 --> 00:09:16.110
My answer is, just watch the
capacity utilization numbers.

00:09:16.110 --> 00:09:19.200
And, just you know, the stimulus
plan, the whole idea

00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:24.350
about it is, the government
doesn't want us to enter into

00:09:24.350 --> 00:09:25.340
a deflationary spiral.

00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:27.650
If consumption drops like this,
we have all of this

00:09:27.650 --> 00:09:30.170
capacity and prices go down.

00:09:30.170 --> 00:09:32.540
If prices go down a little
bit, it doesn't affect

00:09:32.540 --> 00:09:33.710
people's behavior
in aggregate.

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.310
But if people start having
expectations that wages will

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:40.130
go down, that prices will go
down then, they all go into

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.580
panic mode and they
stop spending.

00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:50.500
Let's say they stop spending,
then utilization goes down

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:54.430
even more, then unemployment
goes up even more, and this

00:09:54.430 --> 00:09:56.580
also makes fear go
up even more.

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:59.890
Unemployment going up and fear
going up makes people stop

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:01.010
spending even more.

00:10:01.010 --> 00:10:04.950
And this is that deflationary
cycle that all the economists

00:10:04.950 --> 00:10:07.070
and all of the government
officials are afraid of.

00:10:07.070 --> 00:10:11.250
You saw that during the
Great Depression.

00:10:11.250 --> 00:10:13.380
Let me draw a zero point
to show you where.

00:10:21.450 --> 00:10:22.700
That is zero.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:26.710
That's the dividing
line between

00:10:26.710 --> 00:10:27.940
inflation and deflation.

00:10:27.940 --> 00:10:30.500
You see we've had a couple
of bouts of deflation.

00:10:30.500 --> 00:10:32.740
And they normally aren't good
times in the world.

00:10:32.740 --> 00:10:35.260
This is the Great Depression
right here.

00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.950
This is post World War I, and
the Great Depression actually

00:10:38.950 --> 00:10:42.640
lasted all the way until-- we
entered the war in the late

00:10:42.640 --> 00:10:46.350
`30s-- right about
here to here.

00:10:46.350 --> 00:10:47.880
We had a little bit
of inflation.

00:10:47.880 --> 00:10:50.400
You had the first wave of the
New Deal stimulating some

00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:52.780
spending, but it really never
got us to any significant

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:53.540
level of inflation.

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:55.690
Just so you have a sense, I
would consider anything above

00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:58.390
5% inflation as really,
really bad.

00:10:58.390 --> 00:11:00.980
And let me draw a line there.

00:11:00.980 --> 00:11:03.260
So that's the 5%
inflation mark.

00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.340
So we really didn't get above 5%
inflation until you end up

00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:11.110
with World War I, and then you
have the postwar period, we're

00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:14.120
under Bretton Woods, and then
in the `70s we had, as I

00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:18.640
talked about before, the oil
shock and all of the rest. The

00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.220
rest is history.

00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:23.430
But as you see, the deflationary
periods are

00:11:23.430 --> 00:11:25.960
things that government officials
want to avoid

00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:26.970
altogether.

00:11:26.970 --> 00:11:30.350
So the idea of the stimulus is
for the government to borrow

00:11:30.350 --> 00:11:32.640
money, because no-one
else can.

00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.580
And they can essentially fill
up the gap where the

00:11:36.580 --> 00:11:38.680
consumers left off.

00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:40.020
Now the question is, are
they going to fill

00:11:40.020 --> 00:11:41.440
up enough of a gap?

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:44.290
Actually I realize that I'm
running out of time again.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:46.920
I don't like to make these
videos too long, so I'll talk

00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:49.200
about that in the next video.
