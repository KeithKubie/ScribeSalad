00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:03.270
So far, we've been
focused on the elasticity

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:04.970
of demand for only one good.

00:00:04.970 --> 00:00:06.980
We've thought about how
changes in the price

00:00:06.980 --> 00:00:10.280
of that good affect
changes in its quantity.

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:14.130
Now what we're going to explore
is how we can go across goods.

00:00:14.130 --> 00:00:16.965
So we're going to talk about
the cross elasticity of demand.

00:00:23.527 --> 00:00:26.110
And there's multiple different
scenarios we could think about,

00:00:26.110 --> 00:00:28.970
but it's really thinking about
how a price change in one good

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.130
might affect the quantity
demanded in another good.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:35.550
And to see an example of this,
think about two airlines--

00:00:35.550 --> 00:00:38.640
two competing airlines-- maybe
it's the same exact route going

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:41.420
at the exact same time, maybe
between New York and London.

00:00:41.420 --> 00:00:45.490
So airline one, right
over here-- airline two,

00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:47.670
very competitive,
price right over here

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:49.730
is $1,000 for a round trip.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:52.210
Quantity demanded
is 200 tickets,

00:00:52.210 --> 00:00:53.520
let's say, in a given week.

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.550
Airline two, price is
$1,000 for the round trip,

00:00:58.550 --> 00:01:03.430
and the quantity demanded
is 200 tickets as well.

00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:05.680
Now let's think about
what will happen.

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.460
What will happen if
airline one raises

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:16.840
its price from $1,000 to $1,100?

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:19.490
In fact, we could
even do something

00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.740
less dramatic than that,
to $1,050-- so a relatively

00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:25.860
small increase in price.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:28.610
And remember, when we think
about the percentage price

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.360
increase, when we're thinking
about elasticities in general,

00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:34.400
we don't just say,
OK, $50 on top

00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:36.950
of $1,000, that's a
5% price increase.

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.870
That's what we would do
in everyday thinking.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:41.440
If you said you went
from $1,000 to $1,050,

00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:47.140
you would say that's a $50
increase on a base of $1,000

00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:49.397
or that is a 5% increase.

00:01:49.397 --> 00:01:50.980
But when you think
about elasticities,

00:01:50.980 --> 00:01:53.940
because we want to have the same
percent change between-- if you

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.570
go from $1,000 to $1,050,
or if you go from $1,050

00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:00.310
down to 1,000-- we actually use
the average point as a base.

00:02:00.310 --> 00:02:03.030
So the percent change
in this scenario--

00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.690
let me write it right over here.

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.470
So our percent change--
and I'll write it

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:10.970
in quotes, because
it's a little bit

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:14.040
different than what you do
in traditional mathematics

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:15.920
when you think about
percent changes-- is

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.770
you had a 50 change in price.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:21.650
Your price went up by
50, and on our base

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:26.280
we will use 1,025, which is
the average of 1,000 and 1,050.

00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:34.880
And so that gives us a
change of 50 divided by 1,025

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:40.250
is equal to, let's
say, roughly 4.9%.

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:45.750
So this is approximately 4.9%,
we'll say, "increase" in price,

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.980
although we're going to put
that increase in quotes,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:50.110
because we're using
it on the average.

00:02:50.110 --> 00:02:52.870
And we do that so that if we
said it was 1,050 to 1,000,

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:56.920
it would still be a 4.9%
decrease using this same idea--

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:59.420
using the midpoint as the base.

00:02:59.420 --> 00:03:01.770
Now, when that happens--
Everyone today,

00:03:01.770 --> 00:03:03.500
they use these
travel sites where

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:06.690
you can compare
prices-- If these really

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:10.010
are the exact same route, going
from the exact same airport

00:03:10.010 --> 00:03:12.310
to the exact same other
airport in London,

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:15.430
leaving at the exact
same time, everyone

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.180
is going to gravitate
to this one now,

00:03:17.180 --> 00:03:19.960
because it's only $1,000--
even just to save $50.

00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:22.460
Why would they ride
on this airline?

00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.580
So this quantity demand
is going to go to 0.

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.610
And this quantity demanded
is going to go to 400.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:30.860
And we're not going to think
about the actual capacity

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:31.984
of the planes and all that.

00:03:31.984 --> 00:03:34.350
We're going to have a
very simple model here.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:37.210
So what was the percent
change in quantity for airline

00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:38.860
two right over here?

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:43.900
Well, once again, our change
in quantity is 200, not 400.

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:45.380
We went from 200 to 400.

00:03:45.380 --> 00:03:47.410
So we gained 200.

00:03:47.410 --> 00:03:51.330
And our base, we want to use
the average of 200 and 400,

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.010
which is 300.

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:59.120
And so this is
approximately 67%.

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.700
So we have, all of a
sudden, our cross elasticity

00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:12.110
of demand for airline
two's tickets,

00:04:12.110 --> 00:04:16.910
relative to a1's price.

00:04:16.910 --> 00:04:23.180
And we get the percent
change in the quantity

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:29.140
demanded for a2's tickets, which
is 67% over the percent change,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:33.150
not in a2's price change,
but in a1's price change.

00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:35.160
That's why we call
it cross elasticity.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.710
We're going from
one good to another.

00:04:38.710 --> 00:04:44.700
So let's just say, for
simplicity, roughly 5%.

00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:45.725
And so you do the math.

00:04:48.470 --> 00:04:56.500
So if you have 67% divided by
5%, you get to roughly 13.4.

00:04:56.500 --> 00:05:00.740
So this is approximately 13.4.

00:05:00.740 --> 00:05:04.430
So you have a very high
cross elasticity of demand.

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:07.300
In fact, if you even
increase this, maybe by $5,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:08.950
you might have had
the same effect.

00:05:08.950 --> 00:05:12.600
And so you would have had
a very large number here.

00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:15.110
And that situation right here,
for this cross elasticity

00:05:15.110 --> 00:05:16.760
of demand-- it's
because these things

00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:18.510
are near perfect substitutes.

00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:20.386
The way that we set up
this problem, we said,

00:05:20.386 --> 00:05:22.218
well, people don't care
which one they take.

00:05:22.218 --> 00:05:24.250
They're just going to
go for the cheapest one.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:27.950
And so when you have
near substitutes,

00:05:27.950 --> 00:05:37.070
or nearly perfect
substitutes, for each other,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:42.980
like this example right here,
the cross elasticity of demand

00:05:42.980 --> 00:05:46.079
approaches infinity.

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:47.620
It gets higher and
higher and higher.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:50.680
In theory, if these are really,
really, really identical,

00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:53.010
even if you raise this a
penny, people will say, well,

00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:54.093
why would I waste a penny?

00:05:54.093 --> 00:05:55.720
I would just use airline two.

00:05:55.720 --> 00:05:58.590
And so this number would be
even lower right over here.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:01.580
And so this thing might
approach infinity.

00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:04.090
And notice this was a positive.

00:06:04.090 --> 00:06:07.115
When we just did regular
price elasticity of demand,

00:06:07.115 --> 00:06:08.990
the only way that you
would increase quantity

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:13.130
for a traditional goods
was by lowering price.

00:06:13.130 --> 00:06:17.280
But here, we raise price on a
substitute competitive product,

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.090
and we raise the demand
for airline two's

00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:24.870
product, which actually
made a lot of sense.

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:27.120
So it wasn't a
negative relationship.

00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.890
It's actually a positive
value right over here.

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.760
But you could have
things in other--

00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:34.010
you could have that
negative relationship using

00:06:34.010 --> 00:06:35.650
cross elasticity of demand.

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.280
This is an example
of a substitute.

00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.370
We could think about the
example of a complement.

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:50.090
So what if we're
talking about e-books?

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:52.710
So let's say I have
some type of an e-book,

00:06:52.710 --> 00:06:56.200
and the current quantity
demanded in a given week

00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.130
is 1,000.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.990
And let's say that the price
of an e-reader that you

00:07:00.990 --> 00:07:07.570
would need for my
e-book is $100.

00:07:07.570 --> 00:07:10.080
But let's say that
price of the e-reader

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:16.900
goes down from $100 to $80.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:21.390
So you had a $20
decrease in price.

00:07:21.390 --> 00:07:27.610
Well, what's going to happen to
my e-book, assuming its price

00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.840
does not change?

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.840
Well, then the quantity demanded
for my e-book will go up.

00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:34.890
So let's say the quantity
demanded for my e-book goes up

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:36.600
by 100, because more
people are going

00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.790
to be able to afford
this, or they're

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:39.206
going to have money
left over when

00:07:39.206 --> 00:07:40.925
they buy this to
buy more e-books.

00:07:40.925 --> 00:07:43.300
And so I don't even know what
the price for my e-book is,

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:46.230
but at a given price point, the
quantity demanded will go up.

00:07:46.230 --> 00:07:48.740
And so this goes to 1,100.

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:51.280
And so I'll leave it
to you to calculate

00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:54.580
this price elasticity of demand.

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.530
But you will see that you will
actually get a negative value,

00:07:57.530 --> 00:07:59.580
like we're used to
seeing for regular price

00:07:59.580 --> 00:08:01.106
elasticity of demand.

00:08:01.106 --> 00:08:02.730
And when you do
calculate it, remember,

00:08:02.730 --> 00:08:07.230
you want to do your
percent price change

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:21.022
in e-book quantity over percent
change in e-reader price.

00:08:21.022 --> 00:08:22.730
And the other thing
you have to remember,

00:08:22.730 --> 00:08:24.350
you don't just take
negative 20 over 100.

00:08:24.350 --> 00:08:26.475
You take negative 20 over
the average of these two,

00:08:26.475 --> 00:08:29.332
when you're thinking of it
in the elasticity context.

00:08:29.332 --> 00:08:30.790
So this right over
here-- actually,

00:08:30.790 --> 00:08:32.164
maybe we'll just
work it through.

00:08:32.164 --> 00:08:33.950
Pause it, and try
to do it yourself.

00:08:33.950 --> 00:08:41.809
So this value right over
here is negative 20 over 90--

00:08:41.809 --> 00:08:46.190
the average of those two--
and this value right over here

00:08:46.190 --> 00:08:51.730
is going to be plus 100 over
the average of these two.

00:08:51.730 --> 00:08:55.140
So the average of
those two is 1,050.

00:08:55.140 --> 00:09:03.640
And so this is 100
divided by 1,050,

00:09:03.640 --> 00:09:07.090
which gets you to about 0.95.

00:09:07.090 --> 00:09:10.370
So about 9 and 1/2% change in
quantity demanded for my book.

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:15.280
And then this
denominator right here

00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:19.710
is negative 20 divided by 90.

00:09:22.320 --> 00:09:25.130
So you get a drop of 22%.

00:09:25.130 --> 00:09:27.560
And so if you divide the
numerator by the denominator,

00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:35.300
you get 0.952 divided
by negative 0.22222--

00:09:35.300 --> 00:09:37.400
I'll just put couple
of 2's there--

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.080
and you get a negative 0.43.

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:46.670
So this is equal
to negative 0.43.

00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:47.550
And this makes sense.

00:09:47.550 --> 00:09:49.630
If you lower the
price of an e-reader--

00:09:49.630 --> 00:09:53.630
this complement product,
a product that goes along

00:09:53.630 --> 00:09:56.380
with my e-book-- it
increases the demand.

00:09:56.380 --> 00:09:58.940
So just like you get with
price elasticity of demand,

00:09:58.940 --> 00:10:01.970
you get a negative
value over here.

00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:05.100
And what about completely
two unrelated products?

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:11.020
So let's say that
I have basketballs,

00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:15.380
and the price of basketballs
goes from, let's say,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.330
$20 to $30.

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:20.037
What's going to
happen to my e-book?

00:10:20.037 --> 00:10:21.620
Well, my e-book's
not going to change.

00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.390
It's going to stay at $1,000.

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:28.420
So my percent change in the
quantity demanded of my e-book

00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:30.525
is going to be 0
in this example.

00:10:30.525 --> 00:10:31.900
So we're going to
have 0, when we

00:10:31.900 --> 00:10:34.140
want to do this cross
elasticity of demand,

00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.530
over my percent
change in basketballs,

00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.090
which would be 30 over 25.

00:10:39.090 --> 00:10:45.760
So whatever that
is-- 30 over 25 would

00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.340
be 10 over 25-- which
is a 40% increase.

00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:56.430
So that would be 0 over
40%, which equals 0.

00:10:56.430 --> 00:10:58.860
So for unrelated
products, products

00:10:58.860 --> 00:11:00.540
where the price of
change in one of them

00:11:00.540 --> 00:11:03.020
does not affect the quantity
demanded in the other,

00:11:03.020 --> 00:11:04.780
it makes complete
sense that you have

00:11:04.780 --> 00:11:07.819
a 0 cross elasticity of demand.

00:11:07.819 --> 00:11:10.110
If they're complements, you
would have a negative cross

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:11.074
elasticity of demand.

00:11:11.074 --> 00:11:13.490
And if they're substitutes,
you would have a positive one.

00:11:13.490 --> 00:11:16.270
And the closer the substitutes
they are, the more positive

00:11:16.270 --> 00:11:20.080
your cross elasticity of
demand is going to be.
