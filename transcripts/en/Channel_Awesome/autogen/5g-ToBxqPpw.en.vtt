00:00:38.969 --> 00:00:40.190 align:start position:0%
looks like Thor I mean he's got the red
cape<00:00:39.210><c> you've</c><00:00:39.360><c> got</c><00:00:39.510><c> the</c><00:00:39.690><c> helmet</c><00:00:39.960><c> though</c><00:00:40.110><c> he</c>

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:40.200 align:start position:0%
cape you've got the helmet though he
 

00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:41.990 align:start position:0%
cape you've got the helmet though he
doesn't<00:00:40.440><c> wear</c><00:00:40.559><c> the</c><00:00:40.590><c> helmet</c><00:00:41.010><c> much</c><00:00:41.190><c> which</c><00:00:41.850><c> is</c>

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.000 align:start position:0%
doesn't wear the helmet much which is
 

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.330 align:start position:0%
doesn't wear the helmet much which is
probably<00:00:42.360><c> a</c><00:00:42.450><c> good</c><00:00:42.540><c> thing</c><00:00:42.780><c> um</c><00:00:43.320><c> but</c><00:00:43.800><c> actually</c>

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:44.340 align:start position:0%
probably a good thing um but actually
 

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:46.549 align:start position:0%
probably a good thing um but actually
surprisingly<00:00:45.329><c> it</c><00:00:45.480><c> didn't</c><00:00:45.780><c> look</c><00:00:45.870><c> that</c><00:00:46.050><c> bad</c><00:00:46.289><c> on</c>

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559 align:start position:0%
surprisingly it didn't look that bad on
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.170 align:start position:0%
surprisingly it didn't look that bad on
him<00:00:46.710><c> so</c><00:00:46.890><c> maybe</c><00:00:47.039><c> that</c><00:00:47.670><c> maybe</c><00:00:47.789><c> he</c><00:00:47.969><c> should</c><00:00:48.090><c> have</c>

00:00:48.170 --> 00:00:48.180 align:start position:0%
him so maybe that maybe he should have
 

00:00:48.180 --> 00:00:52.160 align:start position:0%
him so maybe that maybe he should have
