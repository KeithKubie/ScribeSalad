FRANCESCO CROVETTO: Hi,
everyone, and welcome.

00:00:02.530 --> 00:00:04.180
So my name is Francesco.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:07.100
And I'm a business analyst
in the Google Play team.

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:11.240
And today we'll talk together
with Toby about influencers.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:14.800
But let me start by
introducing one of them to you.

00:00:14.800 --> 00:00:16.329
So his name is Yarn.

00:00:16.329 --> 00:00:18.370
He's a YouTube
Gaming influencer.

00:00:18.370 --> 00:00:21.280
And he has a channel called
Orange Juice Gaming with more

00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:23.910
than one million subscribers.

00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:26.510
So these people really
trust his gaming reviews.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:29.930
And we are here today
together with Toby to tell you

00:00:29.930 --> 00:00:32.090
more about the
value that we think

00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:35.240
Yarn, as well as other
YouTube influencers like him,

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:36.460
can bring to your business.

00:00:39.510 --> 00:00:43.170
So today we'll go
through three main areas.

00:00:43.170 --> 00:00:45.710
The first one is about
the influencer opportunity

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:47.300
and challenges.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.370
Then I will walk you
through a methodology

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.440
that we build
internally in Google

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.650
to measure the full value
of influencer marketing.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:57.200
And then Toby will
finish by telling you

00:00:57.200 --> 00:01:00.890
some best practices on how to
build a successful influencer

00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:02.110
strategy going forward.

00:01:05.580 --> 00:01:08.340
So we all know this
YouTube is a big thing.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:11.430
And it is a big thing
on the youth side.

00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:14.820
So what research says
is that 90% of gamers

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:17.220
turn to YouTube at
least once a week

00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:20.620
to discover gaming content.

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.440
This gaming content could
be about advancement tips.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:25.270
Maybe users are
stuck into a level

00:01:25.270 --> 00:01:27.100
and want to know
how to get through.

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.280
It could be to watch their
favorite creator playing games

00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:33.080
or to discover new games.

00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.770
So definitely YouTube is a
big thing on the user side.

00:01:35.770 --> 00:01:39.160
But what about on
the developer side?

00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:41.410
Well, I'm sure that you
know from your business

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.050
that it is a big thing on
the developer side as well.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:49.520
So game developers already today
spend more than $250 million

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.920
a year on influencer content.

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:53.840
And this number is
forecasted to grow

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.020
a lot in the next few years.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.850
But that's what research says.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.920
I'm actually curious to
know, within this room,

00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.580
how many of you spent
on influencer content

00:02:04.580 --> 00:02:06.170
in the past couple of years?

00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:09.240
Please hands up.

00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:11.400
Pretty much everyone.

00:02:11.400 --> 00:02:14.700
And how many of you
are 100% confident

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:16.770
that the methodology
that you used

00:02:16.770 --> 00:02:19.770
to evaluate the full
impact of these campaigns

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.240
is fully accurate?

00:02:23.240 --> 00:02:25.920
One person.

00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:26.420
OK.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:29.057
We should talk afterwards.

00:02:29.057 --> 00:02:30.140
I actually agree with you.

00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:33.170
It's really, really tough
to measure the full impact

00:02:33.170 --> 00:02:35.220
of influencer content.

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.970
And there is this big
industry attribution challenge

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:41.680
that I'm sure everyone
in this room faces.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:44.020
So the way it works
today is that developers

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:47.020
would collaborate
together with creators.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:49.390
Then these YouTube
creators or influencers

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.990
will produce a video, upload
the video into their channel,

00:02:52.990 --> 00:02:55.210
and then include one of
these trackable links

00:02:55.210 --> 00:02:58.368
in the description
underneath the video.

00:02:58.368 --> 00:02:59.910
And then, obviously,
developers would

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.550
hope that all the users
who watch the video

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.560
and are interested
to download the game

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:08.080
do it by clicking on the
link so they can be tracked.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.000
However, we all know that
this is not the case.

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.880
Some of the users
who watch the video

00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:14.890
and still don't
know the game do it

00:03:14.890 --> 00:03:16.750
without clicking on the link.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.080
And so it's really hard to
understand what is the value

00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:24.290
and what is the size of
this nontracked majority.

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.040
And so the classical ways
that developers use nowadays

00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:30.600
to do that is to look at the
performance of the video,

00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.970
look at how many people click on
the link and download the game,

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:37.000
and try to estimate
this key factor of users

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:40.850
who watch the video, didn't
click, but still download.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:41.960
And how to do that?

00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.070
You would usually look at
your install numbers over time

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:48.830
and try to estimate how
many of these users that you

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.480
see in these spikes are coming
through the video itself.

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.750
Well, that's a really
hard thing to do.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:59.370
And it's even harder whenever
there is noise in the installs.

00:03:59.370 --> 00:04:02.010
So try to imagine that you
just launched your game.

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:04.320
There would be a spike
in installs anyway even

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.390
without videos.

00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:08.820
Or try to think that
you're running a paid

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.440
campaign at the same time.

00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:12.570
How do you know how
much of these users,

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:16.440
this nontracked majority, is
coming from paid, organic,

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:19.621
or the video itself?

00:04:19.621 --> 00:04:21.079
Well, let me spend
a minute to talk

00:04:21.079 --> 00:04:22.680
about this nontracked majority.

00:04:22.680 --> 00:04:25.020
Who are these users?

00:04:25.020 --> 00:04:27.410
So these are people who
are watching the video

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:29.660
and deciding not to
click on the link

00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.460
but still download the
game, or maybe they

00:04:31.460 --> 00:04:33.920
didn't see the click the link.

00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:38.230
It could be users who watch
the video, download the game,

00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:40.820
but wait for Wi-Fi not
to use their whole data

00:04:40.820 --> 00:04:43.880
plan while installing,
or it could be also

00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:46.280
users watching the
video on PC and then

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.370
just grabbing the phone next
to them to download the game.

00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:52.630
Does this sound familiar?

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:53.500
Great.

00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:55.960
So we thought that
we, as Google, we

00:04:55.960 --> 00:04:58.180
are in a unique
position to try to help

00:04:58.180 --> 00:05:00.310
you to understand the
value and the size

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.360
of this nontracked majority.

00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:03.910
And so we developed
a methodology

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:08.330
that I am really excited
to share with you today.

00:05:08.330 --> 00:05:10.360
So what we did, we
combined the knowledge

00:05:10.360 --> 00:05:13.600
that we have from YouTube,
meaning users watching videos,

00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.990
and from Play, meaning the same
users then going on the store

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:19.570
and hopefully
installing the game.

00:05:19.570 --> 00:05:21.400
And so with this
methodology, we have

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:24.460
been able to see out
of the cohort of users

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:27.310
who have been exposed, who
watched a YouTube gaming

00:05:27.310 --> 00:05:29.710
video featuring a
particular game, how

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:32.290
many of these same
users after viewership

00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:36.960
went into the Play Store
and downloaded the game.

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:39.000
And then we want to
go one step further

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.070
and try to understand what
is the value of these users.

00:05:42.070 --> 00:05:44.880
So we also checked how many
of them turned into buyer.

00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:47.340
And if they do, how much
they spend over time

00:05:47.340 --> 00:05:50.840
after viewing the video.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:52.530
And so then we use
this methodology

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:56.640
to analyze a pool of
more than 120 videos,

00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:59.400
making up a total
of 50 million views.

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.590
And in order not to be
biased with the results

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.760
that we are going to
share with you today,

00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:08.010
we took examples from
developers of all sizes, genre,

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:10.980
and with games at
different lifecycle stages.

00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:13.800
And then we mix it up also
on the influencer side.

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.440
So we took examples
from micro as well

00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:19.710
as more established influencers
and also from gaming

00:06:19.710 --> 00:06:22.620
as well as nongaming
influencers.

00:06:22.620 --> 00:06:25.770
And so I'm really excited
now to share with you some

00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.150
of the insights that we have.

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.830
So let's jump into measuring
influencer and the key insights

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:34.300
that we have.

00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:37.650
So we divided the insights
into two main buckets,

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:39.430
insights about
the gamers and how

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.460
we go through them, and then
insights about the influencers.

00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:46.950
And Toby will come back
to talk to you about that.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:48.110
So the gamers.

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:51.210
I'm sure that the question that
everyone is asking themselves

00:06:51.210 --> 00:06:55.290
right now is we talked about
this nontracked majority,

00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:57.270
how big it is.

00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.460
Well, I'm very glad
to tell you today

00:06:59.460 --> 00:07:01.590
that using our
methodology, we saw

00:07:01.590 --> 00:07:04.620
that there are four 4x more
installs beyond the tracking

00:07:04.620 --> 00:07:05.120
link.

00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:10.780
That means that next time that
you do an influencer marketing

00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.090
campaign, for every
person that you

00:07:13.090 --> 00:07:15.670
see that watches the
video, clicks on the link,

00:07:15.670 --> 00:07:18.400
and download the game,
you can expect on average

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:21.565
to have four more people who
do the same without clicking.

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.390
And by the way, 4x
is just an average.

00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:29.270
This multiplier can
be as high as 10x

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:32.210
depending on the type of
content and the type of game

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:36.338
that the creator is featuring.

00:07:36.338 --> 00:07:37.880
And so the follow
up question that we

00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:39.960
had after that,
after understanding

00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:42.360
how big is this
nonprofit majority,

00:07:42.360 --> 00:07:45.330
is how does the distribution
of the install look

00:07:45.330 --> 00:07:46.900
like over time?

00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:48.360
Do they come all
at the same time?

00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:52.840
Do they come after a few hours,
after a few, days, and so on.

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:55.710
And so what we saw
is that, on average,

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:00.660
50% of the install come within
the first hour after users

00:08:00.660 --> 00:08:03.850
viewed the video on YouTube.

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:06.040
But then you may also
think, OK, but what

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:09.910
about if I want to know a good
attribution we know to capture

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:12.790
all the installs, not just 50%.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.190
Then we saw that
after four days,

00:08:15.190 --> 00:08:17.440
the installs start to be flat.

00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:20.800
So users after the moment
when they watch the video,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.800
it take about four days
to decide whether or not

00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.610
to install the game.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:27.640
So if you're not sure of
the attribution window

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:31.420
to use for your next
influencer marketing campaign,

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:32.950
then four days is a good one.

00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:39.620
Second insight is about ripple
effect across your portfolio.

00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:42.320
So similar games
will get it in stores

00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:45.440
as well, even if they
are not shown or featured

00:08:45.440 --> 00:08:47.610
in your video.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:50.610
So what we saw is that for
an influencer marketing

00:08:50.610 --> 00:08:54.130
campaign showing a particular
game in your portfolio,

00:08:54.130 --> 00:08:57.090
let's call it game
A, then you can also

00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:00.090
get installs in game
B in your portfolio

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:04.270
even if it was not shown
in the video itself.

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.690
So for every 10 people
who watched the video

00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:10.630
and download the game A, there
is also one person on average

00:09:10.630 --> 00:09:12.930
which would go one step
further and download also

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:16.130
game B from your portfolio.

00:09:16.130 --> 00:09:18.310
And again, one out of
10 is just an average.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:21.610
This multiplier can be as
high as three people out of 10

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:25.090
people depending on
the type of influencer

00:09:25.090 --> 00:09:28.810
and also depending if the users
who installed the first game

00:09:28.810 --> 00:09:30.880
in your portfolio
love it so much they'd

00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:31.960
want to try another one.

00:09:35.630 --> 00:09:37.980
So last insights
is about targeting.

00:09:37.980 --> 00:09:39.080
Targeting matters.

00:09:39.080 --> 00:09:41.480
Focus on your key audience.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:44.790
Well, this insight may
sound a little bit obvious.

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.760
However, what is
interesting to see

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:48.870
is that this is not always true.

00:09:48.870 --> 00:09:53.450
And it really depends on the
metric that you want to drive.

00:09:53.450 --> 00:09:54.850
So if you want to
drive installs,

00:09:54.850 --> 00:09:57.110
that is definitely the case.

00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:01.360
So the creator, which had the
audience with a demographic

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:04.810
that matches as much as possible
the demographic of the game

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.000
itself, those
videos are the ones

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.948
who have the highest
install per view rates.

00:10:10.948 --> 00:10:12.740
However, if you want
to [INAUDIBLE] trends,

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:15.290
this is not always
the case, because what

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:18.110
we saw from the data
is that, on average,

00:10:18.110 --> 00:10:21.470
users between 24
and 49 years old

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:26.480
are 3x more likely to
spend than younger users.

00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:28.450
And by the way, when
they predict spend,

00:10:28.450 --> 00:10:32.260
they have on average a
30% higher average revenue

00:10:32.260 --> 00:10:34.940
per paying user.

00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:36.890
So next time you do
a campaign, think

00:10:36.890 --> 00:10:38.450
about what you want to drive.

00:10:38.450 --> 00:10:41.540
If you want to drive installs,
then definitely focus

00:10:41.540 --> 00:10:43.140
on your key audience.

00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:44.840
If you want to
drive spend, focus

00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:48.020
on the users between
24 and 49, because they

00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:49.400
are more likely to buy.

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.680
And when they buy,
they spend more.

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:54.430
So let me now pass
it over to Toby

00:10:54.430 --> 00:10:57.010
to talk about the insights
on the influencers.

00:10:57.010 --> 00:10:58.256
Thank you.

00:10:58.256 --> 00:11:01.497
[APPLAUSE]

00:11:02.382 --> 00:11:03.840
TOBIAS KNOKE: Thank
you, Francesco.

00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:06.640
And he's actually not the
best FIFA player on our team.

00:11:06.640 --> 00:11:08.140
So that's something else.

00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:08.670
OK.

00:11:08.670 --> 00:11:11.400
So I will now talk a
bit about the insights

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:13.950
we have gathered when it
comes to the influencers,

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:18.660
because Francesco and I did not
only look at influencer videos.

00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.090
We also talked to
many developers

00:11:21.090 --> 00:11:22.830
to understand a
bit better how they

00:11:22.830 --> 00:11:24.630
are working with influencers.

00:11:24.630 --> 00:11:27.240
And one thing we have
been hearing pretty often

00:11:27.240 --> 00:11:30.480
is that once a developer
is finding an influencer

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:33.930
to work with, the developer
likes to work with them again

00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:35.170
and again.

00:11:35.170 --> 00:11:36.690
Well, this is
something you can do.

00:11:36.690 --> 00:11:40.450
But we also saw an effect you
might want to be aware of.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:44.340
And this is something what
we call download fatigue,

00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.500
because if you work
with the same creator

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:49.500
again within the time
period of a year,

00:11:49.500 --> 00:11:54.360
the second video will have
on average 2x less installs

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:56.530
compared to the first video.

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.640
So you can draw the
conclusion that gamers

00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.680
who will see the first
video of a specific creator

00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:05.010
will either convert or not.

00:12:05.010 --> 00:12:08.040
And you still might want to work
again with the same creator,

00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:10.590
because maybe you want to
work with them to build

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:13.040
your community, to
re-engage users,

00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:15.030
or there was just a good deal.

00:12:15.030 --> 00:12:18.080
But this is something
to be aware of.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:21.230
Secondly, when we were
talking to developers,

00:12:21.230 --> 00:12:23.823
we were discussing so
what is the performance

00:12:23.823 --> 00:12:25.490
of these influencer
marketing campaigns.

00:12:25.490 --> 00:12:28.400
We looked at all the
data we have gathered.

00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:32.960
And one major thing we found out
is that many people out there

00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:36.830
try to measure influencer
campaigns just as the same way

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:39.370
as they measure app
install campaigns.

00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:41.450
I would be a little
bit cautious here,

00:12:41.450 --> 00:12:45.050
because, one, app
install campaigns are,

00:12:45.050 --> 00:12:48.230
if you run them on the classic
performance marketing network,

00:12:48.230 --> 00:12:51.300
a bit different if you
only look at the setup.

00:12:51.300 --> 00:12:52.850
If you work with
an influencer, you

00:12:52.850 --> 00:12:54.920
need to find the
right influencer.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.750
You need to
communicate with them.

00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.310
You need to agree
on a payment model.

00:12:59.310 --> 00:13:04.310
And if you run ads with Google
UAC or any other network,

00:13:04.310 --> 00:13:06.980
you basically have a creative,
the bidding, and a budget,

00:13:06.980 --> 00:13:08.360
and that's it.

00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:12.350
And furthermore, if you look at
influencer marketing campaigns

00:13:12.350 --> 00:13:15.440
based on traditional
performance marketing KPIs,

00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:20.690
they might not perform as strong
as the average UAC, Facebook,

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:23.470
or whatever campaign.

00:13:23.470 --> 00:13:25.860
So that is important to notice.

00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:28.440
But there's one more
thing to be aware of.

00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:31.070
So one, there's more
with influencers

00:13:31.070 --> 00:13:32.180
than just performance.

00:13:32.180 --> 00:13:35.550
And I will tell more
about this very soon.

00:13:35.550 --> 00:13:38.010
And then, thirdly, we
also found a segment,

00:13:38.010 --> 00:13:40.400
which was highly
profitable and very strong

00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:42.350
when it comes to
influencer marketing.

00:13:42.350 --> 00:13:45.240
And those were rather
small influencers,

00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.610
what we call micro influencers.

00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:51.200
So when we were looking at
smaller influencers with 10

00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.490
to 100,000 subscribers,
well, these creators

00:13:55.490 --> 00:14:00.350
were able to drive CPIs which
were on average 3x lower

00:14:00.350 --> 00:14:02.660
than established influencers.

00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.510
And also the
conversion rate, which

00:14:05.510 --> 00:14:09.240
means the view to download,
was very strong as well.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:12.200
Well, I'm now not saying
go away from the big names,

00:14:12.200 --> 00:14:16.360
because they have some obvious
advantages, such as a higher

00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:18.840
virality and so on and so forth.

00:14:18.840 --> 00:14:21.830
But if you are still not sure
about influencer marketing,

00:14:21.830 --> 00:14:24.380
you know remember when
Francesco asked all of you

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:26.330
at the very beginning,
maybe working

00:14:26.330 --> 00:14:30.250
with smaller influencers could
be a nice and less risky way,

00:14:30.250 --> 00:14:36.970
a good entry point to use
this tool for acquiring users.

00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.490
So much for working
with micro influencers.

00:14:40.490 --> 00:14:43.510
This is a summary now of
all the research we have

00:14:43.510 --> 00:14:45.910
been doing over the past month.

00:14:45.910 --> 00:14:48.850
And feel free to share
all these lessons

00:14:48.850 --> 00:14:51.340
learned across your
company with product folks,

00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:53.950
with marketing folks, with
game analytical folks,

00:14:53.950 --> 00:14:57.670
because I think it's
important that every function

00:14:57.670 --> 00:15:00.380
of your company is
aware of these effects.

00:15:00.380 --> 00:15:02.060
And then you can make
the best out of it

00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:04.280
for your specific case.

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.160
So we talked about the installs,
the nontracked majority.

00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.070
We talked about ripple effects,
that targeting is important.

00:15:11.070 --> 00:15:12.850
There's also a download fatigue.

00:15:12.850 --> 00:15:15.580
Influencer campaigns need to
be measured a bit differently

00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:17.890
probably than traditional
performance marketing

00:15:17.890 --> 00:15:18.730
campaigns.

00:15:18.730 --> 00:15:20.410
And there's a strong
potential when

00:15:20.410 --> 00:15:22.820
it comes to micro influencers.

00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:24.990
So what's next?

00:15:24.990 --> 00:15:26.340
What's now?

00:15:26.340 --> 00:15:29.340
Last but not least, I would like
to work with you on building

00:15:29.340 --> 00:15:32.100
now an influencer
strategy, because for you

00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.820
the big question is now, I've
listened to all this research.

00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:39.450
What shall I do now when I'm
at my desk tomorrow morning

00:15:39.450 --> 00:15:41.560
or on Monday morning?

00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.130
So Francesco and I
thought about this.

00:15:44.130 --> 00:15:48.030
And we were thinking, OK, so
maybe if you attend Playtime,

00:15:48.030 --> 00:15:49.950
you'll go back to
your office and you

00:15:49.950 --> 00:15:52.020
talk to your marketing
person or maybe

00:15:52.020 --> 00:15:53.820
you're a marketing
person yourself.

00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.160
And not to use any
stereotypes here

00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.200
but the average performance
marketing person

00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:00.010
might look a bit like this.

00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:03.780
So let's say you go back to the
office and talk to him or her.

00:16:03.780 --> 00:16:05.070
What will you say?

00:16:05.070 --> 00:16:09.820
Well, our idea
would be tell them

00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.550
about the golden rules
for influencer marketing,

00:16:12.550 --> 00:16:16.300
because what we did is we
took all these lessons learned

00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:19.870
and we now have a recommendation
for each of these effects.

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:22.030
And this is one thing
you can take home

00:16:22.030 --> 00:16:23.742
with or take to the office.

00:16:23.742 --> 00:16:25.450
I'm not sure what you
want to do at home.

00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:28.540
But you can take these
lessons learned with you

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:31.160
and apply them in
your daily business.

00:16:31.160 --> 00:16:33.880
So one, consider the
multipliers, the 4x,

00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:36.640
the nontracked majority when
you evaluate your influencer

00:16:36.640 --> 00:16:37.850
marketing campaigns.

00:16:37.850 --> 00:16:38.350
Two.

00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.270
Be aware of the ripple effects.

00:16:40.270 --> 00:16:43.120
And be also aware that
users might download

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:46.180
a similar game which is
not from you but maybe

00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.320
from a competitor.

00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:49.527
So this is something
to be aware of.

00:16:49.527 --> 00:16:51.610
And again, if you're not
too sure about influencer

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:53.680
marketing, maybe
wait until you have

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:56.710
a similar game in your portfolio
so you can finally benefit

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:59.230
a bit from that ripple effect.

00:16:59.230 --> 00:17:02.650
Then thirdly, stick to the
targeting of your key audience.

00:17:02.650 --> 00:17:08.220
And stick to the targeting of
users between 24 and 49 years.

00:17:08.220 --> 00:17:09.750
When it comes to
download fatigue,

00:17:09.750 --> 00:17:12.480
just be aware that
the first video

00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:16.020
is the video which is
generating all these installs.

00:17:16.020 --> 00:17:19.589
And if you engage
again with a creator,

00:17:19.589 --> 00:17:22.319
it will be about re-engagement.

00:17:22.319 --> 00:17:24.220
And when it comes to
influencer campaigns,

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:28.500
well, our thinking is, one, try
to be very performance based.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.850
Try to have CPI or even revenue
share deals with influencers.

00:17:32.850 --> 00:17:36.130
Try to go away from
those CPM deals.

00:17:36.130 --> 00:17:37.710
Obviously, this
is always a thing

00:17:37.710 --> 00:17:39.462
to negotiate for and with.

00:17:39.462 --> 00:17:40.920
And there are
different strategies.

00:17:40.920 --> 00:17:43.770
But this is at least
one thing you can do.

00:17:43.770 --> 00:17:46.050
And then also you can
hedge against the risk

00:17:46.050 --> 00:17:48.840
that maybe some users
who come to your game

00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.060
after watching a video
of an influencer,

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.550
that these users do
not convert and pay.

00:17:53.550 --> 00:17:55.800
Well, if you have
ads in your game,

00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:58.500
you can hedge against this
risk, because every install

00:17:58.500 --> 00:18:00.690
can mean a person
who is watching

00:18:00.690 --> 00:18:03.130
an ad, a rewarded video.

00:18:03.130 --> 00:18:05.620
And then last but not least
for the micro influencers,

00:18:05.620 --> 00:18:08.000
we think that there is
a real opportunity here.

00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:10.362
Do not only focus
on the big names.

00:18:10.362 --> 00:18:12.070
And that's why we
thought, let's give you

00:18:12.070 --> 00:18:15.520
also some best practices for
working with micro influencers.

00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:17.990
And again, there are
many more best practices

00:18:17.990 --> 00:18:20.350
but this is just
something to start with.

00:18:20.350 --> 00:18:22.900
So one, the one
thing is how do you

00:18:22.900 --> 00:18:27.050
find those people who could
be interested in your game?

00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.980
Well, one very simple
idea is just go on YouTube

00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:33.010
and check out who is
streaming your game already.

00:18:33.010 --> 00:18:35.320
Maybe they know
other influencers.

00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.570
Maybe they have subscribed
to some channels.

00:18:37.570 --> 00:18:39.340
Try to dig into this topic.

00:18:39.340 --> 00:18:41.950
Try to really find
those people who

00:18:41.950 --> 00:18:44.500
would be genuinely
interested in your game,

00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:50.390
because if these guys grow,
your game will grow with them.

00:18:50.390 --> 00:18:53.710
Secondly, it's a good
bargaining position for you

00:18:53.710 --> 00:18:56.110
if somebody is not
as established.

00:18:56.110 --> 00:18:58.930
So you can try to
make good deals.

00:18:58.930 --> 00:19:01.240
You should always do fair
deals, because there's always

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.260
karma involved in
the gaming industry.

00:19:03.260 --> 00:19:07.780
But there is definitely a good
bargaining power on your side.

00:19:07.780 --> 00:19:09.970
And then third, if this
was working for you,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:11.200
think of scaling up.

00:19:11.200 --> 00:19:13.270
Think of working with
several micro influencers

00:19:13.270 --> 00:19:14.510
at the same time.

00:19:14.510 --> 00:19:17.530
And if you think this holds
out, all good, but I do not

00:19:17.530 --> 00:19:19.420
have so much time
for this, maybe

00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:22.480
consider working with an
agency or a third party which

00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.280
really knows this stuff.

00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:27.580
And you can now use all the
lessons learned from today

00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.760
to evaluate and brief
these third parties so you

00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:35.070
can be sure that they deliver
the results you're looking for.

00:19:35.070 --> 00:19:38.700
So so much for the performance
marketeer in yourself

00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:39.990
or in your company.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:42.450
But we thought there is
a bit more to influencers

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:43.990
than just performance.

00:19:43.990 --> 00:19:46.440
So when you go back
to your company,

00:19:46.440 --> 00:19:49.410
maybe do not only talk
to the marketing person.

00:19:49.410 --> 00:19:51.750
Maybe also talk
to the guy or girl

00:19:51.750 --> 00:19:55.140
who is looking into
social media and PR.

00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:57.350
And again, not to use
any stereotypes here,

00:19:57.350 --> 00:19:59.950
but that person might
look a bit like this.

00:19:59.950 --> 00:20:05.460
So the important thing is
that community building

00:20:05.460 --> 00:20:08.500
can help you to drive
performance in the long term.

00:20:08.500 --> 00:20:11.280
And that's why you should
empower this person as much

00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:13.980
as the marketeer in your team.

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:15.420
And why?

00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:19.410
Because communities
can help you to be

00:20:19.410 --> 00:20:21.510
successful in the long term.

00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.380
And we tried to come
up with a formula

00:20:23.380 --> 00:20:26.910
because we're here at Google
to explain why that is.

00:20:26.910 --> 00:20:29.100
So one, there is
the rising quality

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:31.090
of new releases out there.

00:20:31.090 --> 00:20:33.150
There are increasing
marketing costs.

00:20:33.150 --> 00:20:35.190
And there are more and
more multiplayer games

00:20:35.190 --> 00:20:36.510
getting released.

00:20:36.510 --> 00:20:39.030
And that means these
users are occupied

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.200
by other games already.

00:20:40.200 --> 00:20:42.840
So it's just getting
more competitive, right?

00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:46.290
And that means there's a need
for creating a community,

00:20:46.290 --> 00:20:48.600
because only if you
create a community

00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.870
you will be able to survive with
your game for more than three,

00:20:51.870 --> 00:20:53.730
four, or five years.

00:20:53.730 --> 00:20:55.680
And creating
communities, well, this

00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:58.650
is all what
influencers are about.

00:20:58.650 --> 00:21:01.830
So do not only think of the
performance marketing aspect.

00:21:01.830 --> 00:21:04.140
Do also think of the
long term benefits

00:21:04.140 --> 00:21:07.920
of working with influencers
and opinion leaders.

00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.320
And I would like to
show you now one example

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.170
of a developer who has
worked with an influencer

00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:16.930
to build a community even ahead
of the release of the game.

00:21:16.930 --> 00:21:20.760
Space Ape Games invited
Team Secret to their office

00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.700
to play the new game "Rumble
League," which has not even

00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:24.900
been released yet.

00:21:24.900 --> 00:21:27.030
So let's see how it
looks like if there

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.167
is a tournament between the
developer and any sports team.

00:21:31.167 --> 00:21:31.834
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:21:31.834 --> 00:21:34.816
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:03.642 --> 00:22:06.624
- This is the match you
have been waiting for.

00:22:06.624 --> 00:22:09.603
Team Secret versus the
hometown heroes, the Space Ape

00:22:09.603 --> 00:22:10.103
developers.

00:22:10.103 --> 00:22:13.582
For the match of a
lifetime, coming to you

00:22:13.582 --> 00:22:17.558
live from the Space Ape
eSports arena/kitchen.

00:22:17.558 --> 00:22:20.043
Are you ready?

00:22:20.043 --> 00:22:23.025
Here we go!

00:22:23.025 --> 00:22:28.492
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:22:52.827 --> 00:22:53.410
[END PLAYBACK]

00:22:53.410 --> 00:22:54.130
TOBIAS KNOKE: Very cool.

00:22:54.130 --> 00:22:54.890
Very cool.

00:22:54.890 --> 00:22:56.470
So I think this
is a great example

00:22:56.470 --> 00:22:58.840
of building a community
even if your game has not

00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:00.190
been released yet.

00:23:00.190 --> 00:23:02.320
The influencers are
playing directly

00:23:02.320 --> 00:23:03.890
against the developers.

00:23:03.890 --> 00:23:05.320
They create bonds.

00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.460
They will reach out
again and again.

00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:09.670
And this is a very,
very strong way

00:23:09.670 --> 00:23:11.680
to be successful
in the long term.

00:23:11.680 --> 00:23:14.530
And that also leads
me to my conclusion.

00:23:14.530 --> 00:23:17.660
The idea is to not only
think of performance,

00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:19.370
but also to think
of performance,

00:23:19.370 --> 00:23:23.410
but just add this thinking that
videos and influencers are more

00:23:23.410 --> 00:23:26.530
and ideally get the
performance marketing

00:23:26.530 --> 00:23:28.660
person and the
social media person

00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:31.390
together, or maybe have
a job description which

00:23:31.390 --> 00:23:34.030
is combining both jobs.

00:23:34.030 --> 00:23:36.490
If you're a smaller company,
you have those already.

00:23:36.490 --> 00:23:41.110
So this is the idea of driving
success with influencers.

00:23:41.110 --> 00:23:43.360
I would like to conclude
now this presentation

00:23:43.360 --> 00:23:44.590
by coming back to Yarn.

00:23:44.590 --> 00:23:45.880
You remember him?

00:23:45.880 --> 00:23:49.150
That was the influencer
Francesco introduced to you

00:23:49.150 --> 00:23:50.350
at the very beginning.

00:23:50.350 --> 00:23:52.720
He has a channel
called OJ Gaming

00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:54.620
with one million subscribers.

00:23:54.620 --> 00:23:57.820
So he definitely knows something
about building communities.

00:23:57.820 --> 00:23:59.860
But now I wonder
what he actually

00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:02.200
thinks of today's presentation.

00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:03.520
Let's hear it from himself.

00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:04.840
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:07.578
- Toby, Francesco, that was
an excellent presentation.

00:24:07.578 --> 00:24:08.370
Thank you for that.

00:24:08.370 --> 00:24:10.800
I hope everyone enjoyed
the insight on influencers

00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.820
on YouTube.

00:24:11.820 --> 00:24:14.850
Me and everyone else are super
excited to be working with you

00:24:14.850 --> 00:24:17.504
and now Playtime.

00:24:17.504 --> 00:24:18.908
[END PLAYBACK]

00:24:18.908 --> 00:24:22.184
[APPLAUSE]

00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.570
TOBIAS KNOKE: Thank
you very much.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:27.080
And if you were not convinced
that building communities

00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:29.460
and engaging users
makes sense, well now

00:24:29.460 --> 00:24:32.660
this was the reason
why it is important.

00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:35.570
This person just engaged
all of your top partners

00:24:35.570 --> 00:24:37.850
in EMEA within 12 seconds.

00:24:37.850 --> 00:24:43.080
If you have any more ideas,
requests, or questions,

00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:47.300
please ask them now or also,
for more extensive questions

00:24:47.300 --> 00:24:49.420
and ideas, please
leave your feedback

00:24:49.420 --> 00:24:53.310
on the
g.co/play/influencervalue.

00:24:53.310 --> 00:24:56.480
And now Francesco and myself are
happy to take a few questions

00:24:56.480 --> 00:24:56.980
right now.

00:25:00.265 --> 00:25:01.890
If you have any
questions, please raise

00:25:01.890 --> 00:25:03.182
your hand and you'll get a mic.

00:25:05.950 --> 00:25:06.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:25:06.910 --> 00:25:09.940
Just a quick question for one
of the last parts you brought up

00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:13.270
regarding using influencers
to use to build communities

00:25:13.270 --> 00:25:15.850
pre or prior to start.

00:25:15.850 --> 00:25:19.850
Like what was the outcome
except for the video?

00:25:19.850 --> 00:25:22.910
TOBIAS KNOKE: I think you need
to ask Space Ape Games to get

00:25:22.910 --> 00:25:24.690
the result of that.

00:25:24.690 --> 00:25:30.120
But what I would personally say
is it is a long term approach,

00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:33.420
because the outcome is
you have influencers

00:25:33.420 --> 00:25:35.040
who then know the game.

00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:36.815
You can be in touch with again.

00:25:36.815 --> 00:25:38.190
And you can then
also be in touch

00:25:38.190 --> 00:25:39.780
with the people they know.

00:25:39.780 --> 00:25:41.920
This is just one e-sports team.

00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.480
So I think this is just
a very, very small shot

00:25:45.480 --> 00:25:48.600
of a longer term strategy
an approach which will just

00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.900
help to have an organic impact
once the game is getting

00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.770
released.

00:25:52.770 --> 00:25:56.820
So let's say it's a bit like
if you're planning a big party

00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.950
and you're already making
friends a few months before.

00:25:59.950 --> 00:26:03.120
So this way the people will come
once you have the party, which

00:26:03.120 --> 00:26:04.530
will be the launch of the game.

00:26:04.530 --> 00:26:05.450
That's what I assume.

00:26:17.240 --> 00:26:20.845
One more working mic.

00:26:20.845 --> 00:26:21.470
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:26:21.470 --> 00:26:21.870
Thank you.

00:26:21.870 --> 00:26:24.300
Thank you for the awesome
presentation I think most of us

00:26:24.300 --> 00:26:28.170
were waiting for this kind of
a thing for quite some time.

00:26:28.170 --> 00:26:31.110
I'd like to ask you please
if you could elaborate

00:26:31.110 --> 00:26:32.740
more of the execution itself.

00:26:32.740 --> 00:26:37.140
So let's say I found
my pool of influencers

00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.080
and I want to
execute a campaign.

00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:43.800
What specifically would I need
to do to make use of this view

00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:48.590
through attribution with the
windows for the Play Store

00:26:48.590 --> 00:26:52.320
and maybe that there are maybe
some plans or strategies how

00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:53.680
to make it more accurate.

00:26:53.680 --> 00:26:58.230
Also for other platforms
as, of course, the traffic

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:02.670
would have spillover effects on
any platform where the game is.

00:27:02.670 --> 00:27:03.642
Thank you.

00:27:03.642 --> 00:27:04.600
TOBIAS KNOKE: So sorry.

00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:10.230
Just the question is how to use
these insights or what exactly?

00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:13.110
Sorry just reactivate
the mic please.

00:27:13.110 --> 00:27:14.910
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:27:14.910 --> 00:27:18.522
So if it's just the
insights or we can use the--

00:27:18.522 --> 00:27:19.230
TOBIAS KNOKE: OK.

00:27:19.230 --> 00:27:19.710
Got it.

00:27:19.710 --> 00:27:20.820
AUDIENCE: --the view
through attribution.

00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:21.270
TOBIAS KNOKE: Got it.

00:27:21.270 --> 00:27:21.810
AUDIENCE: --at some point.

00:27:21.810 --> 00:27:21.980
OK.

00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:22.855
TOBIAS KNOKE: Got it.

00:27:22.855 --> 00:27:25.590
So today was all
about the insights,

00:27:25.590 --> 00:27:27.480
because we are coming
from a long journey

00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:30.580
trying to look at this topic
and helping developers.

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:33.270
So this is basically an
experiment and a pilot.

00:27:33.270 --> 00:27:35.290
If you now think I
want to use this,

00:27:35.290 --> 00:27:37.470
I want to have this
for my business,

00:27:37.470 --> 00:27:40.350
g.co/play/influencervalue.

00:27:40.350 --> 00:27:43.560
Please give us this
feedback, because only

00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:46.860
if we have more ideas and
requests that you want

00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:50.850
to use this technology
or this attribution

00:27:50.850 --> 00:27:52.590
as part of your
business, only then

00:27:52.590 --> 00:27:54.900
we can drive forward
with this project.

00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:55.920
Yes.

00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:57.170
AUDIENCE: Thank you very much.

00:27:57.170 --> 00:27:58.190
TOBIAS KNOKE: Yes.

00:27:58.190 --> 00:28:02.885
I think there was a question
more to front as well.

00:28:02.885 --> 00:28:05.820
AUDIENCE: Just a
a quick question.

00:28:05.820 --> 00:28:08.353
Is your methodology--

00:28:08.353 --> 00:28:09.020
AUDIENCE: Sorry.

00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:10.220
Here.

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:11.070
TOBIAS KNOKE: Hi.

00:28:11.070 --> 00:28:11.810
Bonjour.

00:28:11.810 --> 00:28:15.400
AUDIENCE: Thank you very
much for the presentation.

00:28:15.400 --> 00:28:19.120
Is your methodology
and results also

00:28:19.120 --> 00:28:21.058
applicable to premium games?

00:28:21.058 --> 00:28:22.600
FRANCESCO CROVETTO:
Yeah, absolutely.

00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:26.110
I mean we just had the
look at a cohort of users

00:28:26.110 --> 00:28:29.260
watching a game and then what
do they do on the Play Store.

00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:33.040
So that applies absolutely
to any game, free or paid

00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:35.002
or anything.

00:28:35.002 --> 00:28:37.422
Yeah.

00:28:37.422 --> 00:28:39.720
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.470
Sorry, is this on?

00:28:40.470 --> 00:28:41.150
Yeah.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:41.650
Thanks.

00:28:41.650 --> 00:28:44.260
It's a super useful
presentation.

00:28:44.260 --> 00:28:45.193
Quick question.

00:28:45.193 --> 00:28:47.860
I think one of the challenges as
well is very often the referral

00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:49.950
link on YouTube is
not very visible.

00:28:49.950 --> 00:28:51.490
It's a bit below and all that.

00:28:51.490 --> 00:28:55.360
Are there any plans to make that
referral link have something

00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:57.660
a bit more powerful than that?

00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.410
TOBIAS KNOKE: So we
are looking into this.

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:01.868
But you also know when we are
looking into things at Google

00:29:01.868 --> 00:29:03.700
it can sometimes take a while.

00:29:03.700 --> 00:29:07.370
But we are very, very aware
that right now the solution,

00:29:07.370 --> 00:29:09.160
it looks like a
like a hack, right?

00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.930
It looks like very,
very on the fly.

00:29:11.930 --> 00:29:15.400
And this is still something
what we use in the industry

00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.010
and which is more or less the
standard except that we now

00:29:18.010 --> 00:29:20.090
try to look a bit beyond this.

00:29:20.090 --> 00:29:21.728
So hopefully at some point.

00:29:21.728 --> 00:29:23.020
That's what I think personally.

00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:24.700
But we are looking at the space.

00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:27.770
And again, feel free
to add this feedback.

00:29:27.770 --> 00:29:29.230
Yes.

00:29:29.230 --> 00:29:31.450
We are trying to
begin a movement here.

00:29:31.450 --> 00:29:33.590
And we would be happy if
you were a part of it.

00:29:33.590 --> 00:29:36.160
AUDIENCE: How many requests
do you need there so that we--

00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:36.470
TOBIAS KNOKE: Yes.

00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:37.240
Yes.

00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.050
How many.

00:29:38.050 --> 00:29:41.913
Well, there is no threshold
so we get as many as possible.

00:29:41.913 --> 00:29:44.280
Thanks.

00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:45.320
So one more question.

00:29:45.320 --> 00:29:46.930
Do we have time for
one more question?

00:29:46.930 --> 00:29:47.680
One more question?

00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.330
OK.

00:29:52.330 --> 00:29:52.830
OK.

00:29:52.830 --> 00:29:55.640
If there are no
more questions left,

00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:01.950
then I think we are quite
early or even on time.

00:30:01.950 --> 00:30:03.760
That's the thing about
being in Germany.

00:30:03.760 --> 00:30:09.050
So I am now happy to
send you off to lunch.

00:30:09.050 --> 00:30:11.240
But before we do
that, please make

00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:15.020
sure to check out all the games
we have in the playground.

00:30:15.020 --> 00:30:18.340
So we have VR games,
AR games, AI games.

00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:21.500
There is even a Google Play
quiz so you can test your Google

00:30:21.500 --> 00:30:22.880
Play knowledge.

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.750
And you even can try your
skills in a scooter race.

00:30:26.750 --> 00:30:31.190
So please go back
through the outdoor area

00:30:31.190 --> 00:30:33.950
and be back for the
sessions at 2:00 PM,

00:30:33.950 --> 00:30:35.978
because then we will
listen about monetization.

00:30:35.978 --> 00:30:37.520
And that is something
you do not want

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:39.200
to miss as a game developer.

00:30:39.200 --> 00:30:41.020
Thank you.
