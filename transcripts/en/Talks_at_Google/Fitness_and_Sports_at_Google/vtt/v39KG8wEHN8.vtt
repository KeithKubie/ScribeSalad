[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:08.015 --> 00:00:08.890
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.490
Welcome, everyone.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:11.730
My name is Bradley Horowitz.

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.990
I'm one of the VPs of
Product here at Google.

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:17.350
And it's my pleasure to
welcome you to this Authors

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:20.290
at Google talk with
Jerzy Gregorek.

00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:23.420
And Jerzy is an
amazing individual.

00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.420
And I'm learning that the
more I get to know him

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.240
and his family, who is
also here, over time.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:31.540
The reason, nominally,
that we're here

00:00:31.540 --> 00:00:35.680
is because he is a world
expert in weightlifting.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:39.760
He's a champion in weightlifting
and world record holder.

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:43.240
But more generally, in the
categories of fitness, health,

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:46.600
nutrition, aging,
wellness, he's also

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:48.550
made some incredible
contributions that

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:51.910
are documented in his
book, "The Happy Body."

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:53.770
Beyond that, what
I'm learning is

00:00:53.770 --> 00:00:56.950
that the story that
brought him on this journey

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:59.180
is equally engaging
and entertaining,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:01.810
and this takes us into
realms of mindfulness,

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:05.530
philosophy, stoicism, and
that will be woven through.

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:08.140
So it's not just about
diet and exercise,

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:11.260
although those things
are core to his message.

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:14.950
It's also about his
own journey and how

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.220
he came upon this knowledge
through direct experience.

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.420
So first I'd like to all
take a moment and thank him,

00:01:22.420 --> 00:01:23.290
welcome Jerzy here.

00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:29.220
OK.

00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.680
To kick things
off, you're Polish,

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.670
but you left that country when
it was communist, 31 years ago.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:36.820
Why did you leave?

00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:38.640
And I heard at the
time, you were already

00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.810
training for the Olympics
and were also a firefighter?

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:46.480
JERZY GREGOREK: Before I answer,
thank you for inviting me.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:52.380
And I am so happy that my
wife and my daughter is here.

00:01:52.380 --> 00:01:57.180
I've been married for 39 years,
and that's a big achievement.

00:01:57.180 --> 00:02:02.325
And we have a lovely daughter
that is 13 years old.

00:02:02.325 --> 00:02:05.110
And we are so happy.

00:02:05.110 --> 00:02:13.950
And so I was 13 when
I began weightlifting.

00:02:13.950 --> 00:02:19.010
And why I did it,
well, in Poland,

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.690
people were big and
tall and strong.

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:24.650
So I was short and weak.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:29.970
So I wanted to find edge for
myself and work on myself,

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:33.000
so those who are very
strong would not really

00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.440
push me around.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.300
So I started weightlifting
and really fell in love

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.340
with the thing.

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.030
It was just really fun.

00:02:42.030 --> 00:02:44.580
And thus I became
stronger and stronger.

00:02:44.580 --> 00:02:50.260
It didn't matter anymore
that the bullies were there.

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:52.230
They just disappeared.

00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:58.110
But I continued lifting and
more lifting and falling more

00:02:58.110 --> 00:02:59.640
in love with it.

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:04.420
And then when I was 19,
I was an athlete already.

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:08.040
And in Poland, it was
the time that athletes

00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:13.470
could go to the fire department
and stay there and compete

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.600
for the team.

00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.240
So I ended up to be a fireman.

00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:23.650
And I didn't expect what
would happen to me in the fire

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:29.850
department, but it was quite
an interesting situation.

00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:33.930
And the first time when
I went to the fire,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:35.400
I was in the fire engine.

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.840
I was 19 years old.

00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:42.360
And I was going there, and I
felt this overwhelming feeling

00:03:42.360 --> 00:03:43.365
of goodness.

00:03:43.365 --> 00:03:49.070
It was the feeling
of being needed.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:52.700
And I'd never felt such a
thing, but it was very strong,

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:53.590
and I like it.

00:03:53.590 --> 00:03:56.600
It was very
pleasurable and joyful.

00:03:56.600 --> 00:04:03.650
So from that moment on, I
loved the fire department.

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:06.350
I liked to be a fireman,
just right there.

00:04:06.350 --> 00:04:10.710
So after three years, when
I could leave the fire

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:13.850
department, as if
I was in the Army,

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.250
I stayed in the fire department.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:25.580
And after about five years,
I applied to the Fire Academy

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:30.360
in Warsaw and started
studying there.

00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.570
And it was '78, and I
studied for four years.

00:04:34.570 --> 00:04:38.550
So I studied in the fire.

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:43.260
That's my weight lifting,
actually, time and competing.

00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:45.420
And that's the Solidarity time.

00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:51.780
In 1981, Solidarity
was the stake

00:04:51.780 --> 00:04:56.190
of fighting with the government,
and then the government

00:04:56.190 --> 00:04:59.760
did everything so they
could use more powers

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.370
to fight demonstrations.

00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:06.240
And they tried to take
the fire department

00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:11.250
and put the fire department
into the Army, kind

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:15.520
of a paramilitary, so they could
use the whole fire department

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.260
against demonstration.

00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:20.820
Well, we said, no, we
don't like that idea,

00:05:20.820 --> 00:05:22.740
and we went on strike.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.830
And I was one of the
leaders of the strike.

00:05:25.830 --> 00:05:29.820
And then the strike, after
negotiations for 10 days,

00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:32.400
was brutally put down.

00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:34.540
They took us out.

00:05:34.540 --> 00:05:41.340
They send terrorist brigade
and tanks and took us out.

00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:45.210
After that I found
myself underground.

00:05:45.210 --> 00:05:51.390
And after nine years of being a
fireman, suddenly underground.

00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:56.370
The government formed a new
academy under a different name

00:05:56.370 --> 00:06:03.580
and asked students to sign their
allegiance to the new place.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.220
But it was against, completely,
my ethics and morals,

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:09.750
and I didn't.

00:06:09.750 --> 00:06:11.700
So I started being underground.

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:23.370
During this time, when I was in
the academy during the strike,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:26.490
it was a very difficult
time emotionally,

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:30.840
and people were
under extreme stress.

00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:35.100
So they were students,
and there were 400 of us.

00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:42.420
And there was a priest who
came to help us, to guide us.

00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:46.120
And that priest was
love of the country.

00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:49.920
He was like Martin Luther King.

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:56.250
And his sermons were
very inspiring in helping

00:06:56.250 --> 00:07:02.070
Polish people to survive
this difficult time.

00:07:02.070 --> 00:07:06.530
And the government
hated him so much

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:08.870
at the time, the
communist government,

00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:13.580
that they set up capturing him.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:24.460
And after they captured him
in '84, they would torture him

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:29.370
and martyred him.

00:07:29.370 --> 00:07:32.040
So that was '84.

00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.110
We lost Jerzy.

00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:41.230
It was a very difficult
time for Poland in '84.

00:07:41.230 --> 00:07:44.680
And I was, at the time--

00:07:44.680 --> 00:07:48.190
it was coincidence,
because I was, at the time,

00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.180
called to the police
department in Szczecin.

00:07:50.180 --> 00:07:54.430
And when I was there, I was
lucky because somebody told me

00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.570
that I should leave,
because where I was I

00:07:58.570 --> 00:08:00.760
would never walk out.

00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:09.310
So I ran, and then I
went to Sweden in 1985.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:10.630
So I left Poland.

00:08:10.630 --> 00:08:13.190
Poland is a country
that I extremely love,

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:16.690
but it was time to go.

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:19.250
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
Poland to Sweden--

00:08:19.250 --> 00:08:20.930
was it easy to
get out of Poland,

00:08:20.930 --> 00:08:23.236
or did you have to
sort of sneak out?

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:24.860
You say you were
underground, could you

00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:27.120
just show up with a passport?

00:08:27.120 --> 00:08:30.260
JERZY GREGOREK: It was the
time when the government really

00:08:30.260 --> 00:08:34.640
didn't like troublemakers.

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:36.360
You could get the passport.

00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.360
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: They
were happy to see you go.

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:39.080
JERZY GREGOREK:
Out of the country.

00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:39.950
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
One less problem.

00:08:39.950 --> 00:08:40.450
Yeah.

00:08:40.450 --> 00:08:41.283
JERZY GREGOREK: Yes.

00:08:41.283 --> 00:08:49.340
So when I went to Sweden,
then I went to the Solidarity

00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:55.880
again and Stockholm, and then
I faced a different situation.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:02.660
A lot of people from Solidarity
were divided from the families,

00:09:02.660 --> 00:09:08.150
and there were hunger strikes
and all possible scenarios

00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:10.670
of pain and suffering.

00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:17.630
And then I tried to help
people and talk to people

00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:21.195
and then found myself
actually helping them.

00:09:21.195 --> 00:09:25.490
So how it happened, I
think, it was because when

00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:28.250
I was exposed to Jerzy--

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:32.930
and [? Sjeverni Vorski ?]
was another one--

00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:36.640
people had, during
the Solidarity,

00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.330
something that I've never seen,
and it was unconditional love.

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.720
It was just people
who loved people.

00:09:44.720 --> 00:09:46.080
It was just amazing.

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.180
I'd never seen anything.

00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:50.360
I was 27 years old,
and I thought--

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:56.580
I was always suspicious that
people who have unconditional

00:09:56.580 --> 00:09:58.930
love, they just
pretend this thing.

00:09:58.930 --> 00:10:01.310
And I was exposed to that.

00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.310
And I was exposed to that
for about three years.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:08.290
So when I ended up
to be in Sweden,

00:10:08.290 --> 00:10:13.610
I started doing some
things, and I could actually

00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.090
find the right words
for the right person

00:10:17.090 --> 00:10:18.440
and the right time.

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.970
That I would tell people to
accept the painful situation

00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:27.482
and find a solution to
survive and to go on.

00:10:27.482 --> 00:10:28.940
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So in Sweden, you

00:10:28.940 --> 00:10:32.630
were still involved
with the Polish emigres

00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:35.790
and connected to what
was going on there.

00:10:35.790 --> 00:10:40.250
And at some point, you left
Sweden and came to the US

00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.490
with basically nothing but
the shirt on your back.

00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.550
Tell us a little bit about
what happened leaving Sweden.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:51.920
JERZY GREGOREK: So
when we left Sweden,

00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:56.000
we packed everything into
this huge bag-- one bag.

00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.520
And even our wedding
rings were there

00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:02.230
because they told us that
there are metal detectors,

00:11:02.230 --> 00:11:07.100
so we have to have everything
in our bag and not on us,

00:11:07.100 --> 00:11:09.170
especially metal.

00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:12.260
So when we came to New York,
we were sent to Detroit.

00:11:12.260 --> 00:11:16.920
We came to New York and
our luggage appeared,

00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.040
so we put it to Detroit.

00:11:19.040 --> 00:11:21.800
And when we arrived in Detroit,
the luggage was not there.

00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:29.360
So everything that we
had was in this one bag.

00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:33.290
And we had clothes
on and $1,000.

00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.380
That's all we got.

00:11:35.380 --> 00:11:41.960
And I remember, I was very
upset about the whole situation.

00:11:41.960 --> 00:11:43.610
And I said, you know what?

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:47.620
Maybe life wants us to be clean.

00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.116
So we started clean,
and nothing there.

00:11:50.116 --> 00:11:50.890
[LAUGHS]

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.430
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Did they
ever find the luggage?

00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:52.870
JERZY GREGOREK: No.

00:11:52.870 --> 00:11:54.995
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: You should
file a ticket on that.

00:11:54.995 --> 00:11:56.550
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:56.550 --> 00:11:59.810
JERZY GREGOREK: They gave
a standard-- no. $400.

00:11:59.810 --> 00:12:02.140
That's what we got
for this whole thing--

00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:03.080
by pound.

00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:05.350
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
You're literally--

00:12:05.350 --> 00:12:08.470
I mean, sometimes people use
it as an expression, nothing

00:12:08.470 --> 00:12:11.590
but the shirt on your back,
but you literally had nothing.

00:12:11.590 --> 00:12:12.454
What next?

00:12:12.454 --> 00:12:13.120
Where do you go?

00:12:13.120 --> 00:12:13.930
Where do you turn?

00:12:13.930 --> 00:12:17.060
How do you rebuild from nothing?

00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:20.920
JERZY GREGOREK: So we
landed in LA, eventually.

00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:22.210
We were in Detroit.

00:12:22.210 --> 00:12:25.870
We bought the tickets
to LA because we

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:30.405
wanted to be in Santa
Monica, in the place where--

00:12:30.405 --> 00:12:31.530
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Sunshine.

00:12:31.530 --> 00:12:34.630
JERZY GREGOREK: Sunshine and
training, bodybuilding and so

00:12:34.630 --> 00:12:36.050
on, fitness.

00:12:36.050 --> 00:12:42.831
So before we landed to LA, I
saw all these swimming pools out

00:12:42.831 --> 00:12:43.330
there.

00:12:43.330 --> 00:12:44.380
And it's huge.

00:12:44.380 --> 00:12:45.280
LA is huge.

00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:46.300
Right?

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:49.480
So when I saw this
hugeness, I just

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:52.610
thought, wow, all these
people found themselves.

00:12:52.610 --> 00:12:55.380
So we'll find
ourselves there, too.

00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:56.110
Right?

00:12:56.110 --> 00:12:58.490
So it actually quite helped,
because there was just

00:12:58.490 --> 00:12:59.841
so-- wow, millions of people.

00:12:59.841 --> 00:13:00.340
Wow.

00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:00.970
They are good.

00:13:00.970 --> 00:13:02.590
We will be good.

00:13:02.590 --> 00:13:08.680
And I told Aniela we'd probably
buy a house in two years.

00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:09.460
We'll have a pool.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:12.840
We'd never had a pool, but it
was kind of a dream and joke,

00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.690
too.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.920
Aniela thought that I was crazy.

00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:19.700
I lost myself in
this whole situation.

00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:22.690
But two years after,
we built a house.

00:13:22.690 --> 00:13:24.880
We have a pool.

00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:27.310
Of course, we bought it
when the house was really

00:13:27.310 --> 00:13:30.400
the high price, and our first
earthquake came, and then

00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:31.810
we had to foreclose the house.

00:13:31.810 --> 00:13:33.280
But that's OK, too.

00:13:37.150 --> 00:13:41.440
Life happens to you, and not
always good things happen.

00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:43.570
Sometimes bad things happen.

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:46.630
But more important is how we
adapt to those things and not

00:13:46.630 --> 00:13:50.290
really something else.

00:13:50.290 --> 00:13:55.810
But at that time, when we
landed, eventually, in LA,

00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.260
we found this Polish
couple that helped

00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:06.100
us to sleep and to
be in this house

00:14:06.100 --> 00:14:08.470
behind that they were building.

00:14:08.470 --> 00:14:10.690
And we slept there
for about a month,

00:14:10.690 --> 00:14:16.480
and then they helped us to stand
up, and it was really great.

00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:20.870
But the first thing that
we did to find a job,

00:14:20.870 --> 00:14:26.860
we walked around and try
to find the connections.

00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:29.710
We found the President
of American Weightlifting

00:14:29.710 --> 00:14:34.450
Association, Bob Hayes, who
told us that weightlifting

00:14:34.450 --> 00:14:36.100
coaches don't have any work.

00:14:36.100 --> 00:14:37.750
CrossFit was not existing.

00:14:37.750 --> 00:14:42.840
So nobody wanted
weight lifting coaches.

00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.570
It was bad.

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:44.860
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
Was this about '90?

00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:45.693
I mean, a timeline--

00:14:45.693 --> 00:14:46.870
JERZY GREGOREK: It was '86.

00:14:46.870 --> 00:14:47.110
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: '86.

00:14:47.110 --> 00:14:47.520
OK.

00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:49.019
JERZY GREGOREK: But
he said, there's

00:14:49.019 --> 00:14:52.640
something new coming out, which
is called a personal trainer.

00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.710
So he said, some coaches
like to train regular people.

00:14:56.710 --> 00:14:57.850
Some don't like.

00:14:57.850 --> 00:15:00.260
They just like
athletes, and that's it.

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:03.470
So I said, well, maybe
we'll find-- so I said,

00:15:03.470 --> 00:15:05.650
where do you find these people?

00:15:05.650 --> 00:15:07.150
And he said, well, I don't know.

00:15:07.150 --> 00:15:08.750
They are somewhere in gyms.

00:15:08.750 --> 00:15:09.920
So I said, OK.

00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:12.550
So we started walking
from Los Feliz.

00:15:12.550 --> 00:15:14.860
And Thursday, we
went to Glendale

00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:16.600
and started walking all day.

00:15:16.600 --> 00:15:20.020
And in about two weeks,
we walked to Burbank,

00:15:20.020 --> 00:15:21.460
and we found a Power Source.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:28.660
And we told them who we were,
and Aram gave us the first job

00:15:28.660 --> 00:15:31.870
as a personal trainer.

00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:38.410
What our job was is to write
programs and strategies

00:15:38.410 --> 00:15:41.860
and plans for people
that came and wanted

00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:42.881
to improve something.

00:15:42.881 --> 00:15:44.005
And that could be anything.

00:15:44.005 --> 00:15:46.120
It could be flexibility.

00:15:46.120 --> 00:15:46.990
It could be energy.

00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:48.520
It could be weight loss.

00:15:48.520 --> 00:15:52.260
It could be pains and
get rid of medications.

00:15:52.260 --> 00:15:53.170
Anything.

00:15:53.170 --> 00:15:53.770
Right?

00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:58.840
So then I really found
myself, like I really like it.

00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:00.190
I like it.

00:16:00.190 --> 00:16:03.940
And whatever I wrote,
and whatever I gave

00:16:03.940 --> 00:16:06.640
people worked, and
people really like it.

00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:10.000
And then I had
probably 100 clients

00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:11.410
within three or four months.

00:16:11.410 --> 00:16:12.440
It was very fast.

00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:12.940
I was busy.

00:16:12.940 --> 00:16:14.410
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Just
through word of mouth

00:16:14.410 --> 00:16:15.550
and people sharing.

00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:16.425
JERZY GREGOREK: Yeah.

00:16:16.425 --> 00:16:19.720
Three or four months, I
was working 16 hours a day,

00:16:19.720 --> 00:16:21.430
Saturday and Sunday.

00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:23.800
So we were happy.

00:16:23.800 --> 00:16:27.520
We moved into this
little cottage,

00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:31.450
and the life has
really been great.

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:34.910
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: And
so you invented yourself

00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.930
and invented this practice
of life coaching, training,

00:16:38.930 --> 00:16:40.520
helping people.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.020
Nobody handed you a manual.

00:16:42.020 --> 00:16:43.280
There was no job description.

00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:45.320
You just sort of
went with it, and it

00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:47.600
led to a flourishing business.

00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.410
The threads of that-- has
that really led to Happy Body?

00:16:51.410 --> 00:16:54.500
Is this sort of a continuation
from those early days?

00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:59.630
JERZY GREGOREK: So it
was the time, in '92,

00:16:59.630 --> 00:17:02.940
Aniela thought that we could
start Olympic weightlifting

00:17:02.940 --> 00:17:03.440
back.

00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.069
Because I was injured in Poland.

00:17:05.069 --> 00:17:06.450
I was 23.

00:17:06.450 --> 00:17:11.089
I was paralyzed, and I had to
stop Olympic weightlifting.

00:17:11.089 --> 00:17:13.760
And during the
process of recovery,

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.660
I learned a lot
about body and back

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:20.660
and how to heal the body system.

00:17:20.660 --> 00:17:26.930
And I did everything to get
myself stronger and stronger

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.170
and not challenge the
body to the extremes.

00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:34.340
Microprogression was one
of the ways to do it.

00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:35.170
But it took years.

00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.540
And it was '92, and Aniela
said, we are so strong.

00:17:38.540 --> 00:17:40.800
Maybe we should go and compete.

00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:44.530
We were already past 35.

00:17:44.530 --> 00:17:47.870
I will go to it when the
master division starts.

00:17:47.870 --> 00:17:50.390
And we started.

00:17:50.390 --> 00:17:51.380
I said, OK.

00:17:51.380 --> 00:17:56.550
Well, then we have to do
some kind of adjustments.

00:17:56.550 --> 00:18:00.440
So I check out my body fat
and my powers and so on.

00:18:00.440 --> 00:18:06.510
And it came out that I had to
lose 60 pounds and Aniela 30.

00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.970
[LAUGHS] And we
did it in one year.

00:18:08.970 --> 00:18:12.525
So I projected the numbers
and outlined everything.

00:18:12.525 --> 00:18:16.687
And within one year, I
came from 190 to 130.

00:18:16.687 --> 00:18:17.270
What I am now.

00:18:17.270 --> 00:18:19.520
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: You don't
have pictures of this, do you?

00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:20.870
I'd love to see the
before and after.

00:18:20.870 --> 00:18:21.620
It's hard to imagine you--

00:18:21.620 --> 00:18:23.240
JERZY GREGOREK: I
don't have it here.

00:18:23.240 --> 00:18:24.550
But I have myself at 180.

00:18:24.550 --> 00:18:25.424
[LAUGHS]

00:18:25.424 --> 00:18:26.340
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Wow.

00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.006
JERZY GREGOREK: But
it was a strong 190.

00:18:28.006 --> 00:18:30.490
It was not really
I had so much fat.

00:18:30.490 --> 00:18:34.900
That was bodybuilding training
and powerlifting, bodybuilding

00:18:34.900 --> 00:18:36.560
mostly.

00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:39.150
So we went into
Olympic weightlifting.

00:18:39.150 --> 00:18:47.390
'93 we competed on the
local level, and then

00:18:47.390 --> 00:18:52.610
nationals, and then Pan
American Games in '93, '94.

00:18:52.610 --> 00:18:57.620
And '95, we entered
the World Championship.

00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:04.340
And '97 was the number that
Aniela wanted to really happen.

00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.810
And that was the World
Championship in Poland.

00:19:08.810 --> 00:19:11.180
And the last
competition that I did,

00:19:11.180 --> 00:19:16.030
it was '77 at the same city,
actually, 20 years apart.

00:19:16.030 --> 00:19:18.410
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Had you
been to Poland since or no?

00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:20.410
Were you able to visit
in the intervening years?

00:19:20.410 --> 00:19:21.810
JERZY GREGOREK: After '89.

00:19:21.810 --> 00:19:24.700
Up to '89, a magical place.

00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:28.510
A magical thing
happened in '89, right?

00:19:28.510 --> 00:19:30.880
Just the whole thing collapsed.

00:19:30.880 --> 00:19:33.660
It was just amazing.

00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.540
It was just beautiful to watch
the Berlin Wall going down.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:41.770
And I was part of it.

00:19:41.770 --> 00:19:47.455
Is was just an amazing fight
with such an overwhelming power

00:19:47.455 --> 00:19:49.930
where the communism was.

00:19:49.930 --> 00:19:53.680
You could easily lose your
life, or you could easily

00:19:53.680 --> 00:19:57.700
be forced to obey
and express that.

00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:03.550
It was just a very debilitating
system that actually went down.

00:20:03.550 --> 00:20:05.980
And it was, for me,
such a surprise.

00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:10.600
Nobody would imagine
in '85, in '86,

00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:12.787
that this would happen
in three or four days.

00:20:12.787 --> 00:20:14.620
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So
you had the opportunity

00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:18.420
to go back to a
Poland that you loved

00:20:18.420 --> 00:20:20.740
and was restored
to the Poland you

00:20:20.740 --> 00:20:23.640
wanted it to be and to compete.

00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.230
So how did that go?

00:20:26.230 --> 00:20:28.060
JERZY GREGOREK: Well, that's--

00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:31.650
we went to Poland
to compete in '97,

00:20:31.650 --> 00:20:35.200
and there were Polish coaches
there and American coaches,

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.420
and I represented America there.

00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:41.380
And then I won the championship
and Aniela as well.

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.000
They called us
the golden couple.

00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:47.230
[LAUGHS] But when I
stood in the first place,

00:20:47.230 --> 00:20:50.990
and I heard the national
anthem, and it was American,

00:20:50.990 --> 00:20:54.130
and I was in Poland, and
there was Polish coaches,

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:58.350
and then Americans
coaches, it was so special.

00:20:58.350 --> 00:21:02.200
There is something
with weightlifters

00:21:02.200 --> 00:21:06.520
that before the competition
and during competitions

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:08.800
they're really rough
and tough to win.

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:09.910
Everybody wants to win.

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:14.720
But after, you didn't feel
like there is a country, just

00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:15.476
friends.

00:21:15.476 --> 00:21:16.600
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Humanity.

00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:19.140
JERZY GREGOREK: Yeah,
it's just beautiful.

00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:21.614
I guess it's everywhere
with optimism, maybe.

00:21:21.614 --> 00:21:23.030
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So this takes us

00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:27.300
through your journey, the
triumphant return to Poland,

00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:29.060
the World Championship.

00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:35.090
And shifting gears a little bit,
let's talk about your program,

00:21:35.090 --> 00:21:37.160
The Happy Body.

00:21:37.160 --> 00:21:39.740
And I know you have
some slides to show us,

00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:43.650
as well as maybe a few videos.

00:21:43.650 --> 00:21:47.940
So let's continue
the journey post '97.

00:21:47.940 --> 00:21:51.020
JERZY GREGOREK: So
let's go to 2002.

00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:53.810
In 2002, we competed
in Melbourne.

00:21:53.810 --> 00:21:56.810
There's a Master Olympics,
and we were there.

00:21:56.810 --> 00:22:04.220
And there are athletes
between 35 and 100-something.

00:22:04.220 --> 00:22:08.480
The first time we see
this scope of athletes.

00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:10.580
And there is a
sprinter about 102.

00:22:10.580 --> 00:22:14.160
And then at the stadium,
he talks to people.

00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:16.370
And he talks like
he's 50 years old.

00:22:16.370 --> 00:22:19.160
It's just amazing
when you see people

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:25.990
at that age behaving that way
and having this incredible mind

00:22:25.990 --> 00:22:29.010
and health and youthfulness.

00:22:29.010 --> 00:22:30.530
It's just amazing.

00:22:30.530 --> 00:22:35.160
So I went to see old
weightlifters competing.

00:22:35.160 --> 00:22:38.380
And then I saw
Charlie Henderson,

00:22:38.380 --> 00:22:40.070
and he was 80 years old.

00:22:40.070 --> 00:22:49.450
And he came, and he was going to
lift the weight equals his body

00:22:49.450 --> 00:22:51.180
weight.

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.720
And I was looking at that,
and I was just thinking, wow,

00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.910
that's incredible.

00:22:55.910 --> 00:22:58.550
80-year-old doing this?

00:22:58.550 --> 00:23:04.880
And I'm a poet, so I was
transported into this life when

00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:06.440
I was a teenager.

00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:10.870
And we were doing this
street lifting, and whoever

00:23:10.870 --> 00:23:12.050
was stronger, and so on.

00:23:12.050 --> 00:23:17.070
So the best of us could do it,
the lifting the body weight.

00:23:17.070 --> 00:23:20.570
So I was just thinking,
this guy's doing this.

00:23:20.570 --> 00:23:25.490
He is as strong as the teenagers
or 20s, up there, right?

00:23:25.490 --> 00:23:28.030
So this is crazy.

00:23:28.030 --> 00:23:31.250
So I thought, wow, that
should be my standard--

00:23:31.250 --> 00:23:35.050
to create a program and
to create a standards

00:23:35.050 --> 00:23:37.650
from these 80-year-olds
and transfer

00:23:37.650 --> 00:23:42.410
the Olympic weightlifting to
find the exercise that people

00:23:42.410 --> 00:23:47.600
could perform and would gain
the power and the strength

00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:51.020
at that level and have
it throughout life.

00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:52.250
And it was that idea.

00:23:52.250 --> 00:23:55.100
Now, the routine,
of course, would

00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:57.600
need to cover a lot of things.

00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:59.600
So flexibility--
everything would

00:23:59.600 --> 00:24:04.700
be but one that could make the
power, that could make people

00:24:04.700 --> 00:24:08.130
stronger and live
life in a better way.

00:24:08.130 --> 00:24:09.830
So that would be flexibility.

00:24:09.830 --> 00:24:11.450
People need flexibility.

00:24:11.450 --> 00:24:12.530
People need strength.

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:15.620
People need speed,
coordination, posture.

00:24:15.620 --> 00:24:19.370
A certain ideal body
weight, so that food

00:24:19.370 --> 00:24:21.830
would be needed to cover.

00:24:21.830 --> 00:24:27.180
And then an exercise system that
would correct all the problems.

00:24:27.180 --> 00:24:31.640
And the system had
to be reactive.

00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:35.000
Reactive to the problems
that people already had.

00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:38.690
Knee problems, hip problems, and
other problems with the body.

00:24:38.690 --> 00:24:42.500
And microprogression had to
be implanted in the training

00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:44.450
system.

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:45.740
So we did that.

00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:47.810
But also there
was something else

00:24:47.810 --> 00:24:51.920
that people had when
we trained them.

00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:55.190
It was that people were
extremely stressed.

00:24:55.190 --> 00:25:00.950
So the training, the exercise
routine, had to be mindful,

00:25:00.950 --> 00:25:04.760
had to be pleasurable, joyful,
so people throughout their life

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:07.280
would come back to it.

00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:10.490
And also it had to
be a singular focus.

00:25:10.490 --> 00:25:14.890
So a singular focus had to be
implanted into the routine.

00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:16.910
And that's what we did.

00:25:16.910 --> 00:25:19.520
And it started being
magical as people

00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:22.490
started really getting better.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:27.380
And the program worked,
but still the program

00:25:27.380 --> 00:25:32.324
needed some adjustment
on the mind side.

00:25:32.324 --> 00:25:33.740
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So it was really

00:25:33.740 --> 00:25:35.750
the inspiration
from Charlie, seeing

00:25:35.750 --> 00:25:37.850
what an 80-year-old
could do, that

00:25:37.850 --> 00:25:41.180
led you to the work that
led into The Happy Body

00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:42.140
and your system.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:43.056
JERZY GREGOREK: Right.

00:25:43.056 --> 00:25:47.480
So I will talk about
aging and would

00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.120
like to show you
what really happens

00:25:50.120 --> 00:25:53.150
and what I understood in 2002.

00:25:53.150 --> 00:26:03.450
And so when we are
born until about 18,

00:26:03.450 --> 00:26:05.096
everything is good for us.

00:26:05.096 --> 00:26:05.970
We're getting better.

00:26:05.970 --> 00:26:07.130
We are getting stronger.

00:26:07.130 --> 00:26:10.470
And life really helps
us to really get better.

00:26:10.470 --> 00:26:14.330
Whether we do anything or not,
we are actually getting better.

00:26:14.330 --> 00:26:15.050
[LAUGHS]

00:26:15.050 --> 00:26:16.640
So then it goes--

00:26:19.476 --> 00:26:25.190
then something happens at
about 18 and 35, where athletes

00:26:25.190 --> 00:26:28.370
compete against each other,
and it doesn't matter

00:26:28.370 --> 00:26:30.410
whether they are 35 or 18.

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.350
Everyone can win and between.

00:26:33.350 --> 00:26:34.880
So this is the flat area.

00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:37.130
But this is the flat
area where, really,

00:26:37.130 --> 00:26:40.130
people who have families,
business, and children

00:26:40.130 --> 00:26:43.610
and so on, this is the
flourishing, the most beautiful

00:26:43.610 --> 00:26:46.910
time and most powerful time.

00:26:46.910 --> 00:26:50.730
But after that,
everything goes down.

00:26:50.730 --> 00:26:54.210
And then no matter
what, the life actually

00:26:54.210 --> 00:26:55.230
is doing the opposite.

00:26:55.230 --> 00:26:58.050
Life is aging us.

00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.960
And the aging stars
about 35, really.

00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:06.750
So when you look at the
older records in swimming

00:27:06.750 --> 00:27:11.430
and running and weightlifting,
they show that from 35,

00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:16.570
no matter what athletes do,
they deteriorate about 2%.

00:27:16.570 --> 00:27:21.320
So if you want to be the
same, you need to improve 2%.

00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:25.640
If you want to improve 2%,
you have to improve 4%.

00:27:25.640 --> 00:27:28.190
Because this happens to you.

00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:31.340
But this is the road
of the World Champion.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:35.540
Of course the
purpose would be now

00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:43.160
to take a person from being weak
and having pains and improve.

00:27:43.160 --> 00:27:46.730
And then when you can see
where the 80-year-old is--

00:27:46.730 --> 00:27:49.700
there's a huge gap between
the 80-year-old and the one

00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:53.670
that doesn't train at all.

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.750
So this shows us that
after five years,

00:27:57.750 --> 00:27:59.790
the records are going down.

00:27:59.790 --> 00:28:02.630
And this is the
situation when people

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:06.340
choose how they actually--

00:28:06.340 --> 00:28:09.050
after 35, when they
are top athletes,

00:28:09.050 --> 00:28:11.840
they can go really
down steep, or they

00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:14.990
can go on and become
very youthful, even

00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:19.510
though they are 100 years old.

00:28:19.510 --> 00:28:25.600
So what can be done
for any regular person

00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:28.830
is the improvement is there.

00:28:28.830 --> 00:28:34.030
And there is a huge gap between
anybody who doesn't train

00:28:34.030 --> 00:28:37.820
and the one that is powerful.

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.420
So there is a huge reserve
for everybody to improve.

00:28:41.420 --> 00:28:45.530
So I want to show you
now something special.

00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:50.080
So I coached this cerebral
palsy boy who came to me.

00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.560
He was 25 years old.

00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:55.840
When he came, he was lethargic.

00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.570
He was completely
dependent on his parents.

00:28:58.570 --> 00:29:01.520
He couldn't put his
clothes on himself.

00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:09.370
And he couldn't focus
for a minute or longer.

00:29:09.370 --> 00:29:10.970
Didn't have energy.

00:29:10.970 --> 00:29:21.760
So I tested him the first
day, he couldn't press.

00:29:21.760 --> 00:29:25.250
He couldn't take, off the
rack, 15 pounds aluminum bar.

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.500
He was so weak.

00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:32.153
And that's after-- this is
one of these first days.

00:29:32.153 --> 00:29:34.118
Let me show you this.

00:29:34.118 --> 00:29:34.618
OK?

00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:42.180
So he's pressing
this 15 pound bar.

00:29:42.180 --> 00:29:44.084
He's very weak.

00:29:44.084 --> 00:29:46.300
Right?

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:56.810
So after 2 and 1/2 years, the
boy presses his body weight.

00:29:56.810 --> 00:29:58.910
154 pounds.

00:29:58.910 --> 00:30:02.960
So 1,000% difference.

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:07.100
2 and 1/2 years of
work and 1,000%.

00:30:07.100 --> 00:30:10.970
So his life completely
changes because of it.

00:30:10.970 --> 00:30:14.480
He has now strength
enough to read books,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:17.270
to go to school,
to clothe himself,

00:30:17.270 --> 00:30:19.650
to go to toilet on his own.

00:30:19.650 --> 00:30:24.650
All of it happens because of
the microprogression training

00:30:24.650 --> 00:30:28.350
and constant
improvement of energy.

00:30:28.350 --> 00:30:30.650
What else happens is
that his brain was

00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:32.930
very simple at that time.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.380
He didn't have any
conversation because he

00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:39.670
didn't have in the
brain anything else

00:30:39.670 --> 00:30:44.210
than actually going to
sleep or time to eat.

00:30:44.210 --> 00:30:51.290
So after about a year, I asked
his father, so what changed?

00:30:51.290 --> 00:30:56.480
And he said, well, we had a
first conversation, something

00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.300
like that.

00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:01.670
Or that the [INAUDIBLE]
was in the car,

00:31:01.670 --> 00:31:04.195
and he saw a car on the side.

00:31:04.195 --> 00:31:07.310
So I didn't know
what was it about.

00:31:07.310 --> 00:31:10.310
But the father said that he
was always sleeping in the car,

00:31:10.310 --> 00:31:14.070
and then one day,
he said, a car.

00:31:14.070 --> 00:31:15.090
So he saw the car.

00:31:15.090 --> 00:31:21.350
So his energy started
keeping him more awake.

00:31:21.350 --> 00:31:23.327
So he saw the car.

00:31:23.327 --> 00:31:24.410
He said, what was the car?

00:31:24.410 --> 00:31:26.220
He didn't know what was the car.

00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:29.950
So I said, the next day,
when you drive home,

00:31:29.950 --> 00:31:31.290
notice what the car.

00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:31.850
So he did.

00:31:31.850 --> 00:31:35.690
It was a Toyota Prius
or a Volkswagen. I said,

00:31:35.690 --> 00:31:37.010
who drove the car?

00:31:37.010 --> 00:31:38.870
And then he said, I don't know.

00:31:38.870 --> 00:31:39.720
So I said, OK.

00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:40.500
Remember that.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.080
It was a woman or a man.

00:31:42.080 --> 00:31:43.040
And how old.

00:31:43.040 --> 00:31:45.110
So he needed to see that.

00:31:45.110 --> 00:31:49.070
Then it was on and on until he
saw the driving license and all

00:31:49.070 --> 00:31:50.670
of these details.

00:31:50.670 --> 00:31:53.150
So his brain was
really evolving.

00:31:53.150 --> 00:31:56.810
So we'll show you what
happened after 2 and 1/2

00:31:56.810 --> 00:31:58.750
years of training.

00:31:58.750 --> 00:32:03.770
He has a special moment because
he presses his body weight.

00:32:03.770 --> 00:32:05.545
This is a big deal for anybody.

00:32:05.545 --> 00:32:09.090
It doesn't matter whether you
are cerebral palsy or not.

00:32:11.795 --> 00:32:13.751
OK.

00:32:13.751 --> 00:32:14.450
Right here.

00:32:14.450 --> 00:32:14.876
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:32:14.876 --> 00:32:15.376
- Great.

00:32:15.376 --> 00:32:16.154
Good.

00:32:16.154 --> 00:32:17.010
Great.

00:32:17.010 --> 00:32:17.650
Still great.

00:32:17.650 --> 00:32:18.300
- Go for it!

00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:19.152
- 70 kilo!

00:32:19.152 --> 00:32:19.990
Body weight!

00:32:19.990 --> 00:32:21.445
- Yes!

00:32:21.445 --> 00:32:23.385
[GRUNTS]

00:32:23.385 --> 00:32:25.496
- All right!

00:32:25.496 --> 00:32:29.040
JERZY GREGOREK: So he is-- you
are seeing his leg is up here,

00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:30.810
and the expression of--

00:32:30.810 --> 00:32:32.850
[END PLAYBACK]

00:32:32.850 --> 00:32:34.770
So his leg is very tight.

00:32:34.770 --> 00:32:42.960
His right side of the body
is weaker than the left.

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:45.640
So there are some adjustments.

00:32:45.640 --> 00:32:50.190
But the power is growing and
overriding everything around,

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:55.630
making him more like normal.

00:32:55.630 --> 00:32:57.430
So he is at the beginning.

00:32:57.430 --> 00:33:01.670
He's jumping here on one inch.

00:33:01.670 --> 00:33:05.510
When he came, he couldn't
detach himself off the floor.

00:33:05.510 --> 00:33:07.621
He didn't have energy for that.

00:33:07.621 --> 00:33:08.120
All right?

00:33:12.285 --> 00:33:17.910
And here he's trying
to jump on one inch,

00:33:17.910 --> 00:33:20.910
after probably about
two or three months.

00:33:20.910 --> 00:33:23.710
And now he is jumping--

00:33:23.710 --> 00:33:25.522
trying to jump here on--

00:33:25.522 --> 00:33:26.188
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:33:26.188 --> 00:33:26.688
- Do it!

00:33:26.688 --> 00:33:27.600
- Yeah.

00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.100
- Yes!

00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:29.183
JERZY GREGOREK: 11 inches.

00:33:32.070 --> 00:33:33.120
So he tries.

00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:37.830
And you can see how he
drags his right leg behind.

00:33:37.830 --> 00:33:40.350
But he tries, and he tries.

00:33:40.350 --> 00:33:41.820
He has a really great spirit.

00:33:41.820 --> 00:33:43.980
He's like an athlete.

00:33:43.980 --> 00:33:44.938
- Yeah!

00:33:44.938 --> 00:33:45.438
Yes!

00:33:45.438 --> 00:33:47.868
Yes!

00:33:47.868 --> 00:33:48.840
Yeah!

00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.565
That's it.

00:33:49.565 --> 00:33:51.690
JERZY GREGOREK: And you
see, when he does one time,

00:33:51.690 --> 00:33:53.460
his brain repeats it.

00:33:53.460 --> 00:33:54.420
Even five times.

00:33:54.420 --> 00:33:55.020
It's amazing.

00:33:55.020 --> 00:33:56.508
- [CHEERING]

00:33:57.417 --> 00:33:58.000
[END PLAYBACK]

00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.370
JERZY GREGOREK: You can see
his energy now is really high.

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:07.530
And he's powerful, and
he's able now to almost do

00:34:07.530 --> 00:34:10.889
anything what we actually do.

00:34:10.889 --> 00:34:14.790
So that gave me the
idea that actually it

00:34:14.790 --> 00:34:17.159
doesn't matter where we start.

00:34:17.159 --> 00:34:21.449
That what matters is that when
we find where we start and make

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:22.590
it better.

00:34:22.590 --> 00:34:26.610
Because when I coach
athletes at all kind of ages,

00:34:26.610 --> 00:34:32.159
sometimes a tennis player comes
in, and it's a 12-year-old.

00:34:32.159 --> 00:34:36.750
And I ask, OK, let's jump
on box this height or this.

00:34:36.750 --> 00:34:40.699
There's always a height when
anybody is scared to jump on.

00:34:44.210 --> 00:34:49.909
So when you cannot jump
on 1 inch or 25 inch,

00:34:49.909 --> 00:34:51.350
it really doesn't matter.

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:55.130
What matters is where you
start, and improve that.

00:34:55.130 --> 00:34:59.810
And his improvement is
because he starts very low.

00:34:59.810 --> 00:35:05.512
So he has this huge
gap for improvement.

00:35:05.512 --> 00:35:06.470
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Yeah.

00:35:06.470 --> 00:35:11.450
We were talking about that
before the talk this afternoon.

00:35:11.450 --> 00:35:15.030
And it was really striking
because I called out--

00:35:15.030 --> 00:35:18.980
I know people with cerebral
palsy-- and it was so dramatic,

00:35:18.980 --> 00:35:20.600
the improvement there.

00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:24.020
And that sort of punchline,
that to a degree,

00:35:24.020 --> 00:35:27.440
we all have our starting
point, whether your set point

00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.020
is 1 inch or 24 inches.

00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:32.330
It's really about how do
you move from wherever

00:35:32.330 --> 00:35:34.250
you're starting and improve.

00:35:34.250 --> 00:35:39.680
And there may be more
headroom for an average person

00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:41.810
like myself to where
a top athlete is

00:35:41.810 --> 00:35:44.614
than even cerebral palsy
to what we call normal.

00:35:44.614 --> 00:35:45.530
JERZY GREGOREK: Right.

00:35:45.530 --> 00:35:52.710
Because he improved 1,000%, but
normal people have about 300%.

00:35:52.710 --> 00:35:58.100
So I am 63 years old, but I'm
a World Champion at that age.

00:35:58.100 --> 00:36:02.690
So any 63-year-old
that I will face

00:36:02.690 --> 00:36:05.080
will be a lot weaker than I am.

00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:07.280
They could be a
lot weaker, right?

00:36:07.280 --> 00:36:10.940
So when people come to my
place, and they find out

00:36:10.940 --> 00:36:14.720
that I am 63 years old, and
that I can do whatever I can do,

00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.670
it's just mind blowing for them.

00:36:16.670 --> 00:36:20.270
But at the same time,
it's very inspirational,

00:36:20.270 --> 00:36:21.630
very motivational.

00:36:21.630 --> 00:36:26.040
The people see it and say,
oh, I can be that way.

00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:29.060
So now I want to show
you something else.

00:36:29.060 --> 00:36:35.750
This is a 64-year-old man who
comes into our place and trains

00:36:35.750 --> 00:36:37.040
for 11 years.

00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:38.820
He's 75 now.

00:36:38.820 --> 00:36:42.200
And he comes after
11 years and says,

00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:47.420
you know, I was 64 when I
came here, and I was weak.

00:36:47.420 --> 00:36:49.010
I was inflexible.

00:36:49.010 --> 00:36:51.080
I had replaced two hips.

00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:53.720
And it was just really--

00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:57.080
my life was going down.

00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:02.030
But after 11 years, I'm a lot
better off than when I was 64.

00:37:02.030 --> 00:37:05.000
And actually, I can do
things that I couldn't

00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.800
do when I was in my 20s.

00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:14.290
So he performs full snatches
with two hips replaced.

00:37:14.290 --> 00:37:16.350
He's 75.

00:37:16.350 --> 00:37:20.500
So if he is like
that, there is a lot

00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:24.280
of room, really,
what could be done.

00:37:24.280 --> 00:37:28.646
When Tim first came to
me about three years ago,

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:32.720
he had some pains in his
body because he really

00:37:32.720 --> 00:37:35.380
challenged himself
and found himself

00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.780
to be sore in many
places and inflexible.

00:37:38.780 --> 00:37:44.170
So it took me about
two years to help

00:37:44.170 --> 00:37:49.570
him to become flexible
and do things like this.

00:37:49.570 --> 00:37:52.760
And he was able to do
it after two years.

00:37:52.760 --> 00:37:56.230
But Tim Ferriss is a
unique personality, too,

00:37:56.230 --> 00:37:58.510
because he always
came with a journal,

00:37:58.510 --> 00:38:01.030
and he wrote all the
notes and things.

00:38:01.030 --> 00:38:02.470
So he didn't waste time.

00:38:02.470 --> 00:38:05.860
And it was very
engaging every one

00:38:05.860 --> 00:38:07.870
hour when he was in my place.

00:38:07.870 --> 00:38:09.280
It was engaging.

00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.820
He understood the
microprogression,

00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:15.910
that we do microprogression.

00:38:15.910 --> 00:38:19.030
And because of
microprogression, we

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:22.700
help people actually to
get better and better.

00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:26.890
So then he knew that a lot
of people come to our place,

00:38:26.890 --> 00:38:34.990
and they want to get better, and
they have difficult situations.

00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:39.910
So he called us that
we mend broken people.

00:38:39.910 --> 00:38:45.680
[LAUGHS] So that was
Tim Ferriss' quote.

00:38:45.680 --> 00:38:48.850
So something about
the posture you

00:38:48.850 --> 00:38:51.010
know, the posture is very
important, especially

00:38:51.010 --> 00:38:54.020
for people like you--
computers, computers.

00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.940
And I have a lot of
surgeons that come,

00:38:55.940 --> 00:38:59.680
and they do surgery like this.

00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.120
And they have a lot of pains
in the back and mostly thoracic

00:39:04.120 --> 00:39:04.870
spine.

00:39:04.870 --> 00:39:11.660
And so the program had to
face the whole situation.

00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:16.120
So how do we really
break the posture?

00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:18.160
How do we age the posture?

00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:20.980
So the first thing
that happens to us

00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:25.300
is that we break
the thoracic spine

00:39:25.300 --> 00:39:27.520
by lowering the sternum down.

00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:29.121
So this happens.

00:39:29.121 --> 00:39:29.620
See?

00:39:29.620 --> 00:39:30.560
That's simple.

00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.440
When this happens, my
head goes down too,

00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:35.260
and my side lowers down.

00:39:35.260 --> 00:39:37.330
So in order to
correct that, when

00:39:37.330 --> 00:39:43.090
it happens in the whole one year
time, the head also moves up.

00:39:43.090 --> 00:39:43.990
You see?

00:39:43.990 --> 00:39:49.350
And adjusts to that
so the person can see.

00:39:49.350 --> 00:39:53.350
And it's mostly kind
of like that begins.

00:39:53.350 --> 00:39:57.690
But then when it really
goes, goes, goes worse,

00:39:57.690 --> 00:40:00.610
that the person
cannot see ahead.

00:40:00.610 --> 00:40:02.120
So that's the next stage.

00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:03.920
The next stage is
the knees forward.

00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:06.501
So it then goes like that.

00:40:06.501 --> 00:40:07.000
Right?

00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:08.650
You can see that.

00:40:08.650 --> 00:40:11.800
And then people are really
tight at that moment,

00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:16.630
so they move more that way,
without moving the spine.

00:40:16.630 --> 00:40:20.630
So once the knees
are really tired,

00:40:20.630 --> 00:40:24.067
then the cane is the
other way or the pusher.

00:40:24.067 --> 00:40:26.400
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: It's like
you're aging before our eyes

00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:26.810
here.

00:40:26.810 --> 00:40:27.935
JERZY GREGOREK: Yeah, yeah.

00:40:27.935 --> 00:40:32.740
And then-- there's the chair.

00:40:32.740 --> 00:40:34.990
And you're sitting.

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:36.015
It's hard to stand up.

00:40:36.015 --> 00:40:36.890
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

00:40:36.890 --> 00:40:38.920
Can you go back to yourself?

00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:40.470
This is freaking me out.

00:40:40.470 --> 00:40:41.367
JERZY GREGOREK: Yeah.

00:40:41.367 --> 00:40:42.700
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: That's better.

00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.290
Cool.

00:40:43.290 --> 00:40:47.480
JERZY GREGOREK: So
we said mindfulness

00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.250
and singularity and
posture and everything

00:40:50.250 --> 00:40:54.150
is incorporated
into one routine,

00:40:54.150 --> 00:40:59.370
then you do 30 minutes a day.

00:40:59.370 --> 00:41:01.620
And that's the whole routine.

00:41:01.620 --> 00:41:04.620
And in that routine
of 18 exercises,

00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:09.030
the main purpose of the
routine is one exercise.

00:41:09.030 --> 00:41:11.550
To be good in one exercise--
it's like weightlifting.

00:41:11.550 --> 00:41:14.040
If you do good in
snatch, you are

00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:17.110
good in anything in your life.

00:41:17.110 --> 00:41:20.790
Doesn't matter whether you do
skiing or skating or whatever.

00:41:20.790 --> 00:41:22.620
You will be great everywhere.

00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.780
Because that's the
power of that one lift.

00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.370
So there are hundreds of
exercises that weightlifters

00:41:29.370 --> 00:41:31.330
do, but they don't matter.

00:41:31.330 --> 00:41:36.030
They are only supportive
exercises to make one happen,

00:41:36.030 --> 00:41:37.860
to be really the great in one.

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:39.160
So we have that one.

00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:41.220
We call it power tower.

00:41:41.220 --> 00:41:43.500
So all these exercises
are a routine.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:47.400
The routine is established
with three sequences,

00:41:47.400 --> 00:41:50.880
but mostly one is the aim.

00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.390
And then that's how it looks.

00:41:54.390 --> 00:41:56.130
So this is important.

00:41:56.130 --> 00:42:00.270
Here, for the posture
and flexibility,

00:42:00.270 --> 00:42:04.950
there are three main parts
of the body, really, at stake

00:42:04.950 --> 00:42:05.790
here--

00:42:05.790 --> 00:42:10.440
flexibility of the
ankles, flexibility

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:15.340
of hamstrings and the spine.

00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:18.420
So when you have flexibility
in those three places,

00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:22.920
you should be able to
easily descend down

00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:24.570
without moving forward.

00:42:24.570 --> 00:42:26.081
So descending
should be this way.

00:42:26.081 --> 00:42:26.580
See?

00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:27.990
Like this.

00:42:27.990 --> 00:42:31.140
And then up-- so
you're not doing this

00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:32.880
or raising your heels.

00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:35.190
So when you don't
have flexibility,

00:42:35.190 --> 00:42:37.210
you will not be able to do that.

00:42:37.210 --> 00:42:41.220
But when you actually
raise your arms up,

00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:44.250
it's even more difficult,
because the thoracic spine

00:42:44.250 --> 00:42:44.950
is at stake.

00:42:44.950 --> 00:42:48.165
So that exercise
helps with the ankles,

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:51.950
helps with the hamstrings, the
hips, and then also the spine.

00:42:51.950 --> 00:42:54.810
So eventually, you
become like that.

00:42:54.810 --> 00:42:55.980
Right?

00:42:55.980 --> 00:43:00.000
So that also gave us the
idea that this exercise

00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.700
should be like clean and jerk.

00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:06.810
Now, we transfer all the
numbers to that exercise,

00:43:06.810 --> 00:43:09.270
and that exercise
became the standard

00:43:09.270 --> 00:43:11.790
for strength and
standard for speed.

00:43:11.790 --> 00:43:15.810
If you are good in that,
you are good to live life.

00:43:15.810 --> 00:43:19.300
And if you're good at
that when you are 80, 90,

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.940
well, you are good
at that moment.

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:26.340
So we created this
system that you would,

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:31.020
when you are 30 and 40,
you can actually get better

00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:34.905
at that time, and
easy for you it

00:43:34.905 --> 00:43:37.350
would be to be as strong
as that 80-year-old

00:43:37.350 --> 00:43:39.780
when you are 30 and 40 and 50.

00:43:39.780 --> 00:43:45.420
And you keep that until
you are 90 or 100.

00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:47.250
Fantastic life.

00:43:47.250 --> 00:43:48.480
Incredible.

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.300
That 80-year-old,
Charlie Henderson,

00:43:51.300 --> 00:43:55.590
we went on the banquet after
the World Championship,

00:43:55.590 --> 00:43:57.420
and we met him there.

00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.740
He came.

00:43:58.740 --> 00:44:04.500
He entered the room like this
with his wife, you know, soft--

00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:06.590
the spine, the hips, everything.

00:44:06.590 --> 00:44:08.880
He's like a 15-year-old.

00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:11.070
Like a ballet
dancer he's walking.

00:44:11.070 --> 00:44:13.470
He's not like an 80-year-old.

00:44:13.470 --> 00:44:18.300
His wife, 80-something too, and
then she walked the same way.

00:44:18.300 --> 00:44:23.100
And they pick up the champagne,
and then they started talking.

00:44:23.100 --> 00:44:26.550
Like, you know, wow,
just unbelievable.

00:44:26.550 --> 00:44:31.680
So we really engaged
them into conversation.

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:33.060
Talked about nutrition.

00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:34.170
Talked about exercise.

00:44:34.170 --> 00:44:37.980
How you actually do this so
your joints and everything

00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:42.180
stays really healthy
and not being injured.

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.960
And then we got a lot of
tips how microprogression

00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:48.630
could work, and how
with age, you actually

00:44:48.630 --> 00:44:51.260
adapt yourself to it.

00:44:51.260 --> 00:44:52.327
Beautiful.

00:44:52.327 --> 00:44:54.660
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: So I want
to encourage people to start

00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:55.770
thinking about questions.

00:44:55.770 --> 00:44:57.170
We have a mic over there.

00:44:57.170 --> 00:45:00.360
We'll have about five
minutes for questions.

00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:05.100
I just want to ask a
few more questions.

00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:08.910
Being able to stick to this
and accessibility for anyone,

00:45:08.910 --> 00:45:11.280
is microprogressions
the key that

00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:16.500
makes this so addictive
and consistent?

00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:19.700
How does it work that
not only athletes,

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:22.110
but normal people can--

00:45:22.110 --> 00:45:23.670
or even people
with cerebral palsy

00:45:23.670 --> 00:45:26.260
who can adhere to a
program like this?

00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:29.460
JERZY GREGOREK: So when
we have certain weaknesses

00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:31.680
that we want to
correct, and then we

00:45:31.680 --> 00:45:35.460
have the plan and
strategies-- so The Happy Body

00:45:35.460 --> 00:45:36.600
is that plan and strategy.

00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.930
Something else comes up,
which is ability to apply.

00:45:39.930 --> 00:45:43.230
And that ability to apply,
we dealt with in the last 10

00:45:43.230 --> 00:45:45.210
years, after
publishing the book,

00:45:45.210 --> 00:45:47.190
how to actually make it happen.

00:45:47.190 --> 00:45:53.100
During this time, I
talked to my clients a lot

00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:59.520
about Plato and horses and
our emotions and the mind.

00:45:59.520 --> 00:46:01.200
How that plays.

00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:04.140
And then he gave us
a really great image.

00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:08.040
He said, imagine that
your chariot is your body,

00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:11.970
and the horses are your
feelings, emotions.

00:46:11.970 --> 00:46:14.580
And the mind is the rider.

00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:16.770
He said that when the
horses are dragging

00:46:16.770 --> 00:46:19.740
the rider against his
will, danger is coming.

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:21.220
So that's where
addictions happen

00:46:21.220 --> 00:46:23.400
and all problems and so on.

00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:27.250
So I thought about
this a long time.

00:46:27.250 --> 00:46:30.270
And we focused for
about six, seven years

00:46:30.270 --> 00:46:32.370
of controlling those horses.

00:46:32.370 --> 00:46:36.150
But whenever you control the
horses, something else happens.

00:46:36.150 --> 00:46:40.620
It's that we don't like it,
so we start being against it,

00:46:40.620 --> 00:46:42.800
and we jump back.

00:46:42.800 --> 00:46:47.190
And so how do you actually--

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:50.620
what do you do with the horses?

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:55.170
And I came out with the
idea that these horses

00:46:55.170 --> 00:46:58.020
have to be befriended.

00:46:58.020 --> 00:47:02.010
So you work with
poetry and stories

00:47:02.010 --> 00:47:06.120
and then talk to people
around, and you change, slowly,

00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:11.910
the brain patterns that those
horses are aligned with,

00:47:11.910 --> 00:47:14.100
whatever the mind wants.

00:47:14.100 --> 00:47:17.190
So at the beginning,
when something is hard,

00:47:17.190 --> 00:47:20.880
when you want to do
something, and it's good,

00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:24.240
you will not like it usually,
because it takes-- energy

00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:27.780
takes practice, like you said.

00:47:27.780 --> 00:47:30.570
But when you keep
doing at the beginning,

00:47:30.570 --> 00:47:31.980
you are like a stoic.

00:47:31.980 --> 00:47:33.630
You want to control something.

00:47:33.630 --> 00:47:37.090
But if you want to control
something that is difficult,

00:47:37.090 --> 00:47:37.920
it's hard.

00:47:37.920 --> 00:47:41.340
Then you will be not liking it.

00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:48.570
So you can achieve it, but
you will be more resistant,

00:47:48.570 --> 00:47:50.320
and you will not be happy.

00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.280
But when you switch,
actually, to the other side,

00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:54.840
then you become this--

00:47:54.840 --> 00:47:57.245
I call it a happy
stoic, the happy stoic.

00:47:57.245 --> 00:48:02.310
The happy stoic is the one that
is aligned with what is good,

00:48:02.310 --> 00:48:05.880
what needs to be improved,
and actually likes it.

00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.460
So this is the example.

00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.020
I notice over and
over that's what

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:12.690
happens with losing weight.

00:48:12.690 --> 00:48:18.880
Somebody is 160 pounds and
loses weight, becomes 120.

00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:23.980
But if the brain doesn't
shift, the person stays at 160.

00:48:23.980 --> 00:48:25.780
The brain is in 160.

00:48:25.780 --> 00:48:28.120
The body is in 120.

00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:32.530
And if the brain is not
shifted, then the brain

00:48:32.530 --> 00:48:36.190
will take back the body to 160.

00:48:36.190 --> 00:48:37.590
That's the lifestyle.

00:48:37.590 --> 00:48:41.290
And that is, here,
extremely important

00:48:41.290 --> 00:48:45.590
work that takes the
person from a certain body

00:48:45.590 --> 00:48:48.610
weight to the other
side and creates

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:56.050
this likability and changes
the whole living system,

00:48:56.050 --> 00:48:59.460
that you become, the
person becomes 120,

00:48:59.460 --> 00:49:02.010
and the brain becomes--
they start liking it.

00:49:02.010 --> 00:49:06.700
And it takes time,
but once it happens,

00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:10.380
the happy story becomes.

00:49:10.380 --> 00:49:16.660
So for us, the recent theory
is that we like dance,

00:49:16.660 --> 00:49:19.950
and we pick up this three
months, four months,

00:49:19.950 --> 00:49:22.780
our next thing--

00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:25.120
120 brain.

00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:26.770
You have the metaphor for it.

00:49:26.770 --> 00:49:32.110
So we go, and we learn dancing
and so on, and it takes heart,

00:49:32.110 --> 00:49:35.820
but in some years,
we'll be dancers.

00:49:35.820 --> 00:49:36.390
Yeah?

00:49:36.390 --> 00:49:37.000
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: Awesome.

00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.208
I want to make sure we have
time for a few questions,

00:49:39.208 --> 00:49:42.790
so I'll repeat them if you
can't make your way to the mic.

00:49:42.790 --> 00:49:44.780
So any questions for Jerzy?

00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:45.280
Yes.

00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:46.446
AUDIENCE: I have a question.

00:49:46.446 --> 00:49:52.660
So when you presented that
singular exercise, the flow,

00:49:52.660 --> 00:49:57.088
and you demonstrated that, if a
person starts at a place where

00:49:57.088 --> 00:50:01.762
you actually couldn't completely
do that exercise perfectly, do

00:50:01.762 --> 00:50:03.484
they just keep--

00:50:03.484 --> 00:50:05.944
is your strategy keep
doing that exercise,

00:50:05.944 --> 00:50:08.404
and you will get
better, or should you

00:50:08.404 --> 00:50:11.848
do something else complementary
to increase flexibility

00:50:11.848 --> 00:50:14.074
before you do that exercise?

00:50:14.074 --> 00:50:16.240
JERZY GREGOREK: So what we
do is make a progression.

00:50:16.240 --> 00:50:21.160
So we set up the levels
of squatting to work.

00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:23.710
So you find the
person when the person

00:50:23.710 --> 00:50:26.540
is with dumbbells up
and squatting down.

00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:29.980
So when it comes to the point
when the heel is going up,

00:50:29.980 --> 00:50:34.240
or the body leans forward,
you measure that level

00:50:34.240 --> 00:50:38.960
and sit toward that level.

00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:42.040
And then when you
find that level,

00:50:42.040 --> 00:50:46.120
then you train until that
level becomes comfortable.

00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:50.260
And then you say, one inch
lower, one inch lower.

00:50:50.260 --> 00:50:52.780
Two weeks, three weeks, four
weeks, five weeks, and you're

00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:57.250
slowly, slowly going down
and down until you recover,

00:50:57.250 --> 00:51:01.660
completely, flexibility for
that particular exercise,

00:51:01.660 --> 00:51:02.500
like Power Tower.

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.084
AUDIENCE: So it is
the same exercises.

00:51:04.084 --> 00:51:05.500
JERZY GREGOREK:
The same exercise.

00:51:05.500 --> 00:51:06.580
AUDIENCE: You progress.

00:51:06.580 --> 00:51:07.746
JERZY GREGOREK: Yes, within.

00:51:07.746 --> 00:51:10.500
So you train it like
doing pole vaulting.

00:51:10.500 --> 00:51:12.260
You are a pole vaulter, here.

00:51:12.260 --> 00:51:18.490
You Power Tower, so you
work with one exercise.

00:51:18.490 --> 00:51:23.050
So we can do with
you just short thing.

00:51:23.050 --> 00:51:25.330
You can stand up
and test yourself,

00:51:25.330 --> 00:51:28.250
whether you can go
down toward the chair.

00:51:28.250 --> 00:51:29.170
Stand up, please.

00:51:29.170 --> 00:51:31.660
And then you will see
if you can do that.

00:51:31.660 --> 00:51:36.820
And put your arms on your
chest and try to sit back.

00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:42.040
Sit back and see if you can sit
back without leaning forward.

00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:45.070
So you can see that at a certain
moment you just lean forward.

00:51:45.070 --> 00:51:50.830
And that is the moment that
you need to start working with.

00:51:50.830 --> 00:51:51.970
You see it.

00:51:51.970 --> 00:51:55.270
And mostly we just
squat that way

00:51:55.270 --> 00:52:01.880
and not using our hamstrings
and hips and other joints.

00:52:01.880 --> 00:52:03.530
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
So that question

00:52:03.530 --> 00:52:04.988
was great, because
it really helped

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:08.090
me understand that one of
the bases of your system

00:52:08.090 --> 00:52:10.970
is that anyone can do it.

00:52:10.970 --> 00:52:14.180
It's a question of degree,
like you said before.

00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:17.990
And you can do this
right and then continue

00:52:17.990 --> 00:52:21.530
with microprogressions
to achieve more and more.

00:52:21.530 --> 00:52:24.860
So from day one, you can
actually do the exercise.

00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:27.500
I just did it, I
think, part of it.

00:52:27.500 --> 00:52:29.840
And then it's a question
of applying yourself

00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:31.920
and continuing to get
better and better.

00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.100
JERZY GREGOREK: So
the whole system

00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:39.270
is built to restore a person
from the level the person is.

00:52:39.270 --> 00:52:41.150
So if you find
yourself-- there are

00:52:41.150 --> 00:52:44.360
five levels for every exercise.

00:52:44.360 --> 00:52:47.540
So if you find yourself
in one exercise level five

00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.800
or another one level one, so
you work with those levels,

00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:55.890
and when time passes,
you will become better.

00:52:55.890 --> 00:52:57.860
It's a lot of data
too, because you

00:52:57.860 --> 00:53:00.350
are creating the same
routine, and you're

00:53:00.350 --> 00:53:01.910
doing the same routine.

00:53:01.910 --> 00:53:04.280
And because of it,
you start really

00:53:04.280 --> 00:53:07.190
learning about what you do.

00:53:07.190 --> 00:53:10.910
And then the data
you collect, you

00:53:10.910 --> 00:53:13.670
are learning also
about how to adapt

00:53:13.670 --> 00:53:17.270
that training system in
case something happens.

00:53:17.270 --> 00:53:20.330
So you learn how to
increase the weight.

00:53:20.330 --> 00:53:24.410
You learn how to increase
the depth squatting,

00:53:24.410 --> 00:53:26.380
or you increase the speed.

00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:31.040
And you start really working
on becoming this self coach.

00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:33.980
And after a while, because
you are doing over and over

00:53:33.980 --> 00:53:36.920
the same routine,
you actually learn.

00:53:36.920 --> 00:53:38.184
You have the opportunity to--

00:53:38.184 --> 00:53:39.600
BRADLEY HOROWITZ:
It's a framework

00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:41.320
Googlers would
like, because it's

00:53:41.320 --> 00:53:43.160
an experimental framework
with one variable

00:53:43.160 --> 00:53:44.620
that you can measure, and--

00:53:44.620 --> 00:53:47.510
JERZY GREGOREK: Oh, the tech
generations and all the tech

00:53:47.510 --> 00:53:49.160
people will love The Happy Body.

00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:50.870
Because they love the science.

00:53:50.870 --> 00:53:53.720
Everything is science
in The Happy Body,

00:53:53.720 --> 00:53:56.570
whether it is flexibility,
whether it is strength,

00:53:56.570 --> 00:53:59.990
whether it is ideal body
weight, whether it is leanness,

00:53:59.990 --> 00:54:01.550
everything is in numbers.

00:54:01.550 --> 00:54:03.660
It's mathematics all of it.

00:54:03.660 --> 00:54:07.970
So because it's mathematics,
tech people and engineers

00:54:07.970 --> 00:54:08.470
love it.

00:54:08.470 --> 00:54:10.055
They say, oh, I love it.

00:54:10.055 --> 00:54:11.420
Oh, yes.

00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:13.820
And then they can
do it for months

00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:19.700
and come back and then take
the tune up a little bit.

00:54:19.700 --> 00:54:26.144
But mostly engineers, fantastic
when it comes to The Happy Body

00:54:26.144 --> 00:54:27.060
measure and following.

00:54:27.060 --> 00:54:27.860
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: We like
things we can measure.

00:54:27.860 --> 00:54:29.120
We're almost out of time.

00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:31.490
One more question from someone?

00:54:31.490 --> 00:54:33.890
Yes.

00:54:33.890 --> 00:54:37.580
AUDIENCE: I just wanted to
ask you again about adherence

00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:41.870
and that if you're a coach,
coaches love athletes,

00:54:41.870 --> 00:54:45.380
because you just give them
a program, and they do it.

00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:46.620
They want to get better.

00:54:46.620 --> 00:54:47.560
They want to succeed.

00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.870
They want to win.

00:54:48.870 --> 00:54:54.290
And I think, often, with
non-athletes or normal people,

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.665
even if you have
a great program,

00:54:55.665 --> 00:54:57.248
if you don't stick
to it, you're going

00:54:57.248 --> 00:54:58.370
to get suboptimal results.

00:54:58.370 --> 00:55:01.760
So have there been
any trends or things

00:55:01.760 --> 00:55:03.980
you've noticed when
you work with someone

00:55:03.980 --> 00:55:08.580
about their ability to stick
or not stick with the program?

00:55:08.580 --> 00:55:11.490
Where might someone
relapse, or where might they

00:55:11.490 --> 00:55:12.960
really succeed?

00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.460
JERZY GREGOREK: This way,
in the last 10 years,

00:55:17.460 --> 00:55:21.420
we created a lot of
help in that area.

00:55:21.420 --> 00:55:24.870
I wrote three
books of dialogues.

00:55:24.870 --> 00:55:26.520
And I noticed that
we have a dialogue

00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:31.050
in our mind between
fatalist and the master.

00:55:31.050 --> 00:55:33.060
And the dialogue
about the choices.

00:55:33.060 --> 00:55:37.650
And one book is about
dialogues between fatalist

00:55:37.650 --> 00:55:39.225
and the master when
it comes to food.

00:55:39.225 --> 00:55:40.680
The one, exercise.

00:55:40.680 --> 00:55:42.870
And the other one
is about the rest.

00:55:42.870 --> 00:55:44.920
And then there
are 12 situations,

00:55:44.920 --> 00:55:47.910
and there is dialogue between
the fatalist and the master.

00:55:47.910 --> 00:55:54.060
You learn how to hear that
you have those two, first.

00:55:54.060 --> 00:55:57.780
And then you learn how
strong is the fatalist,

00:55:57.780 --> 00:56:00.270
and how strong is
the master, and learn

00:56:00.270 --> 00:56:05.160
how to write down the
situations and write, actually--

00:56:07.740 --> 00:56:11.880
and the dialogue with
the master of 51%.

00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:14.490
So if you can do
that, over time,

00:56:14.490 --> 00:56:16.300
you're actually getting better.

00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:16.800
All right?

00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:21.970
That's the three books of
dialogues that work with it.

00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:25.230
The other book is "I Got This."

00:56:25.230 --> 00:56:28.920
So it's training-- the grit--

00:56:28.920 --> 00:56:33.540
reading stories, reading poems,
and especially written by us.

00:56:33.540 --> 00:56:39.240
So you need to submerge yourself
with people that actually

00:56:39.240 --> 00:56:43.080
do this, also read
stories or watch

00:56:43.080 --> 00:56:47.910
videos and everything that can
help you to stay on the track,

00:56:47.910 --> 00:56:48.840
right?

00:56:48.840 --> 00:56:51.360
Because really,
we don't know what

00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:57.000
words work to a certain
person at a certain time.

00:56:57.000 --> 00:57:01.860
We noticed that after many
years of working with people

00:57:01.860 --> 00:57:05.560
that certain words
work for one person

00:57:05.560 --> 00:57:07.760
but don't work for another one.

00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:11.580
For example, after four years,
that woman came, and she said--

00:57:11.580 --> 00:57:15.880
and I asked her, so
how is it that you

00:57:15.880 --> 00:57:19.870
are able to change this
already for four years

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:21.610
and then stick to it?

00:57:21.610 --> 00:57:25.250
And she said, you
told me four words.

00:57:25.250 --> 00:57:27.610
And I said, what four words?

00:57:27.610 --> 00:57:30.430
Two years will pass, I told her.

00:57:30.430 --> 00:57:31.940
But I didn't remember.

00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:34.570
But these four words
stuck with her.

00:57:34.570 --> 00:57:38.950
She had the imagination that
the two years will pass,

00:57:38.950 --> 00:57:42.880
and then she will be, in two
years, somewhere in the place,

00:57:42.880 --> 00:57:46.540
and engaged her and
inspired her to do

00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:50.350
the program until the end.

00:57:50.350 --> 00:57:57.660
So I want to close with in
other words, it is time.

00:57:57.660 --> 00:58:05.690
So I met this ballet
dancer who was injured

00:58:05.690 --> 00:58:07.880
and who lost weight.

00:58:07.880 --> 00:58:09.830
And he gained back.

00:58:09.830 --> 00:58:13.190
The brain, 160 and 120.

00:58:13.190 --> 00:58:20.390
So he gained back the
weight after about 10 years.

00:58:20.390 --> 00:58:24.940
I met with him in LA.

00:58:24.940 --> 00:58:27.960
And I said, Barnes, you
have to lose weight.

00:58:27.960 --> 00:58:28.460
Yeah, yeah.

00:58:28.460 --> 00:58:30.660
I have to lose weight.

00:58:30.660 --> 00:58:33.710
And then I said, it is time.

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:36.480
And Barnes says, yeah, yeah.

00:58:36.480 --> 00:58:38.460
You know when I did.

00:58:38.460 --> 00:58:40.830
I said, Barnes, it is time.

00:58:40.830 --> 00:58:44.220
And Barnes, yes,
but I did it then.

00:58:44.220 --> 00:58:47.320
I said, Barnes, it is time.

00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:49.410
And Barnes looks at me.

00:58:49.410 --> 00:58:50.430
It is time?

00:58:50.430 --> 00:58:51.780
I said, yeah.

00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.670
It is time.

00:58:53.670 --> 00:58:58.750
And I said, yeah, it is time.

00:58:58.750 --> 00:58:59.980
And Barnes said, I got it.

00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:00.745
It is time.

00:59:00.745 --> 00:59:01.690
It is time.

00:59:01.690 --> 00:59:05.270
So he goes home, and in
about four or five months,

00:59:05.270 --> 00:59:06.725
loses 50 pounds.

00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:17.530
So we know that somewhere,
the words and the story

00:59:17.530 --> 00:59:21.460
is very motivational
and very powerful

00:59:21.460 --> 00:59:26.530
to do what you need to do.

00:59:26.530 --> 00:59:28.480
So let's say today.

00:59:28.480 --> 00:59:32.800
You could think about what
you want to get better.

00:59:32.800 --> 00:59:35.650
What is the one
thing that you want

00:59:35.650 --> 00:59:41.040
to go home and start improving?

00:59:41.040 --> 00:59:45.830
But if you want to really do
that, you have to pick up one.

00:59:45.830 --> 00:59:46.850
Not two.

00:59:46.850 --> 00:59:47.390
Just one.

00:59:47.390 --> 00:59:50.180
If you want to be
flexible, pick up that one.

00:59:50.180 --> 00:59:52.910
And then start working with it.

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:55.520
If you want to be strong,
you do the strong.

00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:59.750
If you want to lose
weight, do that.

00:59:59.750 --> 01:00:04.640
But just pick up one and
start really committing to it,

01:00:04.640 --> 01:00:06.380
that you will do it every day.

01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:11.650
And priority, you will
have priority for that one.

01:00:11.650 --> 01:00:15.310
So every day, no matter
what, you will do this,

01:00:15.310 --> 01:00:16.420
and you will do this.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:20.204
And you start
improving over time.

01:00:20.204 --> 01:00:21.370
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: All right.

01:00:21.370 --> 01:00:22.411
JERZY GREGOREK: So sorry.

01:00:22.411 --> 01:00:25.309
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

01:00:25.309 --> 01:00:26.350
JERZY GREGOREK: Oh, yeah.

01:00:26.350 --> 01:00:30.280
The hard choices
usually align with--

01:00:30.280 --> 01:00:32.300
hard choices, easy life.

01:00:32.300 --> 01:00:35.630
It's that what you want to
improve, it needs to happen.

01:00:35.630 --> 01:00:38.110
It's like with the stoic.

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.540
It's hard to start to control.

01:00:40.540 --> 01:00:44.250
Something, what will make
you better over time,

01:00:44.250 --> 01:00:47.260
and usually we don't
like it at the beginning.

01:00:47.260 --> 01:00:50.550
So we are the stoic
controlling something,

01:00:50.550 --> 01:00:54.180
but we don't like it.

01:00:54.180 --> 01:01:01.800
And our challenge here is
how to transfer the brain

01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:07.500
toward that goodness that you
want to happen and like it.

01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:11.550
For me it was two potatoes
versus one potato.

01:01:11.550 --> 01:01:14.630
One potato-- I love potatoes.

01:01:14.630 --> 01:01:16.220
I want more potatoes.

01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.230
But one potato, I
know, The Happy Body

01:01:18.230 --> 01:01:24.260
tells me one potato is
enough not to get fat.

01:01:24.260 --> 01:01:25.100
OK?

01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.790
But I like two potatoes.

01:01:26.790 --> 01:01:29.330
My horse is two
potatoes, three potatoes.

01:01:29.330 --> 01:01:30.530
Not one.

01:01:30.530 --> 01:01:33.300
So after a while, I--

01:01:33.300 --> 01:01:37.570
but I choose one potato
as a stoic, not two.

01:01:37.570 --> 01:01:42.420
But I'm not happy, because
I want two potatoes.

01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:49.050
So my big challenge here
is how to transform myself.

01:01:49.050 --> 01:01:51.080
Transition myself
to the one potato

01:01:51.080 --> 01:01:54.255
and hot to change my believing
system that I actually

01:01:54.255 --> 01:01:57.030
like one potato.

01:01:57.030 --> 01:01:59.850
And that is the happy stoic.

01:01:59.850 --> 01:02:01.260
The happy stoic is that one.

01:02:01.260 --> 01:02:04.050
So today, I will
choose one potato.

01:02:04.050 --> 01:02:05.490
I don't want two potatoes.

01:02:05.490 --> 01:02:06.900
I want one potato.

01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.480
But it's the whole
experiences that

01:02:09.480 --> 01:02:15.240
happen throughout the year or
two that build that transition.

01:02:15.240 --> 01:02:16.320
But it is possible.

01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:18.260
And it is really beautiful.

01:02:18.260 --> 01:02:22.890
So when you pick up something,
it will be a hard choice.

01:02:22.890 --> 01:02:25.660
And it will be hard
choice for a while.

01:02:25.660 --> 01:02:28.810
But when you really stick it,
you go home and say, this is--

01:02:28.810 --> 01:02:30.340
I'm going to do it.

01:02:30.340 --> 01:02:34.150
And start working on it
like we work with the dance.

01:02:34.150 --> 01:02:37.000
And even though it's
hard, even though you

01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.850
have to wake up
and do it, or you

01:02:39.850 --> 01:02:43.060
pay for it, like we pay for
the dances, it doesn't matter.

01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:45.350
But one thing, not two.

01:02:45.350 --> 01:02:45.850
One.

01:02:47.995 --> 01:02:48.870
BRADLEY HOROWITZ: OK.

01:02:48.870 --> 01:02:50.960
On that note, that will
have to be the last word.

01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:51.820
Thank you.

01:02:51.820 --> 01:02:53.830
We really appreciate
your enthusiasm.

01:02:53.830 --> 01:02:56.160
You're the living embodiment
of what you teach.

01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.340
So thank you for that.

01:02:57.340 --> 01:02:58.840
JERZY GREGOREK:
Thank you very much.

01:02:58.840 --> 01:02:59.740
Thank you.

01:02:59.740 --> 01:03:01.590
