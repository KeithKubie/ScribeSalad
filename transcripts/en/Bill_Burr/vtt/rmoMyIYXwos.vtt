00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.620
Hey, what's going on? It's Bill burn. It's time for the Thursday afternoon.

00:00:04.621 --> 00:00:07.320
Just before Friday, Monday morning podcast and

Where you going? Going to go work out. There you go. Get on the elliptical.

5
00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:24.500
Yeah, do it. All right. That was part of our prenuptial agreement.

6
00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.510
Keep it looking good. It's exactly what it is.

7
00:00:29.840 --> 00:00:32.750
You would never dare try to get a prenuptial agreement with me.

8
00:00:32.990 --> 00:00:36.740
What are you talking about there? I'm throwing it out there right now.

9
00:00:36.741 --> 00:00:41.450
I'm going to get up post married. No prenuptial postnuptial agreement.

10
00:00:42.080 --> 00:00:44.750
No, I'm going to get all to mine. All mine.

11
00:00:45.860 --> 00:00:48.680
You know I don't even give a shit. You want all this stuff? I don't care.

12
00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:52.370
It's a fucking headache. As long as they got enough for sandwich. I'm good.

13
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:55.790
I want every color of eyes thought shirt.

14
00:00:58.160 --> 00:00:58.993
Yeah, seriously though.

15
00:01:00.890 --> 00:01:01.350
<v 1>Okay.</v>

16
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:03.030
<v 0>I will. I will leave you.</v>

17
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.950
There's a certain level that if you out, if you dropped below,

18
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:11.280
I'm walking is bald. Pasty.

19
00:01:11.660 --> 00:01:14.520
Redheaded male pushing 50 yeah. Good luck. Okay.

20
00:01:14.910 --> 00:01:16.530
Don't look at me like I don't have options. Woman.

21
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.300
I've been out to the strip malls. I've seen the looks. Okay.

22
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.270
You put me in a strip mall, Nia,

23
00:01:24.271 --> 00:01:28.170
that has a dentist and a place where they do your taxes. Okay.

24
00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:29.790
<v 1>Okay.</v>

25
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:32.940
<v 0>Fucking hedges whipping around. Yeah.</v>

26
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:41.520
Ah, she could at least pretend that I'm still kind of good looking. Right.

27
00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.970
All right. Anyways, what's up everybody? How are you? How's your week going?

28
00:01:45.150 --> 00:01:48.180
Is it going well? It's almost over.

29
00:01:49.110 --> 00:01:53.460
At least the bad part of it is, Huh? How about a moment of silence?

30
00:01:53.970 --> 00:01:57.570
How about a fucking moment of silence for everybody who's sitting in a fucking

31
00:01:57.571 --> 00:01:59.040
place? They don't want to be right now,

32
00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:00.243
<v 1>Huh?</v>

33
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:04.210
<v 0>There was your moment and you know what? That's all you deserve.</v>

34
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.480
Why are you still there? Stand up.

35
00:02:07.780 --> 00:02:11.980
Push that plastic wheelchair away from that fucking I know you well then what

36
00:02:11.981 --> 00:02:15.280
are you doing right? Don't do that. You need a plan.

37
00:02:15.281 --> 00:02:18.370
Come up with a fucking plan and my stomach is can be grounding like crazy.

38
00:02:18.371 --> 00:02:23.050
I just, I just got off of a, got off of the plane, had a 7:00 AM flight,

39
00:02:24.400 --> 00:02:26.410
um, came back from New York.

40
00:02:26.411 --> 00:02:31.411
I went to the a and just an amazing a memorial service for Charlie Murphy

41
00:02:31.871 --> 00:02:34.930
yesterday. And, uh, I gotta tell you this, um, cause you know,

42
00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.540
it's a private ceremony, so I'm not gonna give any details,

43
00:02:37.541 --> 00:02:41.620
but I will tell you this, you know, Comedians, we,

44
00:02:41.621 --> 00:02:46.030
a lot of us may die young, but I will tell you this, we have great funerals.

45
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:49.290
It was fucking unbelievable. It was unbelievable. They,

46
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:53.890
a New York legend was sent off by legends. It was, um,

47
00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.320
it was incredible. It was really incredible. So, um,

48
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:02.350
yeah, I'm still sad though, obviously still sad,

49
00:03:02.351 --> 00:03:06.220
but he would have been very happy. I'm like Mona speak from anything but like a,

50
00:03:06.221 --> 00:03:11.110
I hope I get sent off that well of man. It was a, yeah,

51
00:03:11.140 --> 00:03:12.810
there was definitely something else. So that's great. Built,

52
00:03:12.811 --> 00:03:16.240
bring up something that you're not gonna really give any details of. Wow.

53
00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:19.570
You know, whatever. I just, I just, so anyways,

54
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:23.470
so everybody hung out afterwards til like two 30 in the morning and I had like

55
00:03:23.471 --> 00:03:27.970
a, you know, 7:00 AM flight and um,

56
00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.530
the only way that there's two ways to handle a 7:00 AM flight,

57
00:03:32.531 --> 00:03:35.620
which is going to involve like a fucking 4:30 AM pickup.

58
00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:37.633
<v 2>All right?</v>

59
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:41.180
<v 0>There's only two ways to do it. You either go to bed, you know,</v>

60
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.290
you drink some hot cocoa at 7:00 PM and you figure out how you're going to get

61
00:03:45.291 --> 00:03:49.460
your fucking eight hours, whatever you do. What do people do with your pills?

62
00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:54.200
Is that what you do? You sit fucking Indian style in the foot of your bed going,

63
00:03:54.490 --> 00:03:55.323
oh,

64
00:03:56.890 --> 00:03:57.650
<v 3>[inaudible] [inaudible]</v>

65
00:03:57.650 --> 00:04:00.010
<v 0>whatever it is, whatever that meditation shit is. All right.</v>

66
00:04:00.011 --> 00:04:03.580
Which I have not done and I'll tell you the ramifications of that here in a

67
00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:04.610
minute. Um,

68
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:09.070
do they do that or you just stay out drinking with your friends to like two 30

69
00:04:09.071 --> 00:04:12.010
in the morning and then you come home, you get about an hour and a half,

70
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:16.960
two hours sleep, you stagger to the fucking airport, whatever, out to the cab.

71
00:04:17.410 --> 00:04:21.730
You go in there and you just, the biggest thing is not to not offer it the gate.

72
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.090
You gotta stay awake but the lights are on in that type of shit.

73
00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:29.590
And then once you get to your seat, that's it. Then you're out. You're out.

74
00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:31.660
Let's see what's fucking, and that's a great way to do it.

75
00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.970
Cause then you don't have to sit there bored out of your mind on the flight.

76
00:04:34.930 --> 00:04:35.763
<v 2>You know,</v>

77
00:04:36.130 --> 00:04:36.551
<v 0>by the way,</v>

78
00:04:36.551 --> 00:04:41.551
thanks to the person that sent me that fucking creepy video of that plane crash

79
00:04:41.771 --> 00:04:44.470
in which for some dumb reason I'm sitting there watching it.

80
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:49.810
But the tail section coming off this plane and these pilots trying to figure out

81
00:04:49.811 --> 00:04:53.950
a fucking way to try to land it, which of course she can at that point. Um,

82
00:04:54.250 --> 00:04:58.840
I wasn't surprised that they didn't invert. That's always a fun thing.

83
00:04:58.841 --> 00:05:01.510
Half Asleep to be watching cause you know, you have a sleep going like wait,

84
00:05:01.511 --> 00:05:05.860
am I on this flight or is this a, is this a, should I be feeling that failing?

85
00:05:05.861 --> 00:05:08.320
You know, they sent me this video and I'm not getting on this plane. Well,

86
00:05:08.321 --> 00:05:08.651
you know what,

87
00:05:08.651 --> 00:05:13.651
I got on that God damn play and I went right to sleep and a woke up like,

88
00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:18.760
you know, five hours later, five hours later on a six hour flight. It's perfect.

89
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:20.383
<v 2>You know</v>

90
00:05:20.990 --> 00:05:23.550
<v 0>they come over sir. Would you like anything? Would you catch it?</v>

91
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:28.310
[inaudible] I go, yeah. What do you got? Well we got a mushroom.

92
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.940
We got a Portobello mushroom sandwich. Yeah, that sounds gross.

93
00:05:31.941 --> 00:05:34.130
What else she got? I don't even know what the other thing was.

94
00:05:34.131 --> 00:05:36.650
I thought when she said the mushroom thing with the other thing,

95
00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.510
I thought it was all the same thing. I go,

96
00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:41.180
is that all one thing or is that two things? She goes, that's two things.

97
00:05:41.990 --> 00:05:45.660
And I went, all right, I, I don't want anything.

98
00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:50.940
I've got a new thing. I don't eat on planes. I'm not fucking doing it.

99
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:56.970
I'm not fucking doing it. It's just, it's, it's fucking shit food empty.

100
00:05:57.500 --> 00:06:00.970
And do you, do you have like, I'm fucking five miles up from the surface of the,

101
00:06:00.980 --> 00:06:04.040
of the, of, of the earth. You know,

102
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.980
the only thing you should be eating up there is shit that you shouldn't be like,

103
00:06:06.981 --> 00:06:10.430
like Pringles potato chips and stuff. Why would you eat those?

104
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.340
Then you just sit there and get just becoming a fat fuck. So, uh,

105
00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:17.840
I sort of been doing this thing this year is I'm trying to fucking drop some

106
00:06:17.841 --> 00:06:22.670
weight here. You know, even though my dad, I'm not going to have the fun,

107
00:06:22.671 --> 00:06:26.420
I'm not having the fucking dead body not having that thing. You know,

108
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.940
thing when you go to lift up your arms,

109
00:06:29.030 --> 00:06:33.350
your shirt comes up and this just that fucking pork shoulder spilling out on the

110
00:06:33.351 --> 00:06:38.160
side and ain't happening to me. Um, Oh,

111
00:06:38.480 --> 00:06:42.520
speaking of which, so, uh, you know, I packed hastily cause I,

112
00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.300
I when I went to Boston first and then in New York and uh,

113
00:06:47.330 --> 00:06:51.800
so I grabbed a suit and everything in my shoes. So I have them, uh,

114
00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:56.540
for the memorial service and I forgot to bring dark socks. All right.

115
00:06:56.720 --> 00:07:01.160
And also I was working out and doing the elliptical and all that type of stuff.

116
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:05.360
So I thought I brought enough boxers and I didn't. So I was like, fuck.

117
00:07:05.420 --> 00:07:07.910
So I landed in New York,

118
00:07:08.300 --> 00:07:12.920
I get to the hotel and it's, you know, we're like in midtown and shit.

119
00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:17.210
We meaning me and all my fucking personalities. And uh,

120
00:07:17.870 --> 00:07:20.330
so I called me up. I tell her where I'm at. I was like, fuck, you know,

121
00:07:20.390 --> 00:07:24.290
the cars coming and get me to take me over to the service, you know,

122
00:07:24.291 --> 00:07:27.680
I need some, uh, underwear. Where should I go? There's, this is New York.

123
00:07:27.681 --> 00:07:31.360
There's no fucking gaps anywhere. They're all like downtown or way up town.

124
00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:33.230
I'm right in the middle. I don't have time.

125
00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.330
And she asked me where I was at and she goes, oh, I know that. And I was like,

126
00:07:36.620 --> 00:07:39.010
gives like a gay neighborhood. She goes, go around the corner, there's up,

127
00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:42.260
there's, I'm one of those fucking stores. So I go across the store,

128
00:07:42.261 --> 00:07:44.090
right street, right. And there's like, you know,

129
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.120
the second you see the mannequins, you know what I mean? You know that it's,

130
00:07:47.121 --> 00:07:51.170
yeah, this is like a, it's a gay store. It's for gay men.

131
00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:55.100
So I don't give a fuck. I need underwear, right? Gay Men still wear underwear.

132
00:07:55.101 --> 00:07:59.320
So I walk in there and it was just like Jesus Christ.

133
00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:02.120
There was like cock rings on the fucking wall, which by the way,

134
00:08:02.121 --> 00:08:06.680
I thought that was the same is like, like when people get their Dick Pierce,

135
00:08:06.681 --> 00:08:10.220
which I still don't know where they do that. It's like a naval ring,

136
00:08:10.221 --> 00:08:15.060
but it's on your Dick. So I thought a cock ring, you know, I,

137
00:08:15.180 --> 00:08:17.120
I thought that that was the same thing, but it wasn't,

138
00:08:17.121 --> 00:08:21.530
it was like a a look like something you'd use in plumbing, like a gasket.

139
00:08:21.560 --> 00:08:25.070
Evidently you put that around your Dick for some reason. Then what?

140
00:08:25.071 --> 00:08:26.450
You Swivel your hips and it's like a,

141
00:08:26.451 --> 00:08:28.470
it's like a Hula hoop for your dick evidently. Right. So I,

142
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:32.240
I fucking go in the back and the underwear, it's like ridiculous.

143
00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.780
It was like all these Fred Flintstone prints, you know what I mean?

144
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:37.370
There was like assless shit.

145
00:08:38.150 --> 00:08:41.240
And then I finally find a pair that was just all black.

146
00:08:41.480 --> 00:08:45.230
And on the waistband it said nasty pig. So

147
00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.050
finally just yellow to the dude. By the counter go, hey,

148
00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:54.350
you got any like normal like mainstream underwear here?

149
00:08:54.680 --> 00:08:59.640
And he's define normal, our main street. And I was like, well,

150
00:08:59.641 --> 00:09:03.360
I don't know. It doesn't say nasty pig on the, on the waistband.

151
00:09:04.620 --> 00:09:08.460
It has material around the ass. And when it does,

152
00:09:08.461 --> 00:09:11.700
it doesn't say Fuck my hole on the back, you know, regular,

153
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:16.860
just underwear. It's like, hang on,

154
00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:18.270
the fucking comes over there.

155
00:09:18.330 --> 00:09:22.620
And he ended up finding some that we just were all black, you know,

156
00:09:22.621 --> 00:09:26.440
Greg Louganis style. But uh, they, uh,

157
00:09:26.530 --> 00:09:28.320
the only size they had was small,

158
00:09:28.321 --> 00:09:31.980
which was fucking hilarious to me cause I was just like, yeah,

159
00:09:31.981 --> 00:09:34.080
why would you have a medium? This is like gay guys.

160
00:09:34.081 --> 00:09:38.430
They want to see their boyfriends junk spilling out the side. Oh,

161
00:09:38.670 --> 00:09:39.990
you're nasty pig.

162
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:45.080
So I add the leave there and the closest place was fucking TJ Maxx.

163
00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:51.270
Oh my God. The fucking animals,

164
00:09:53.420 --> 00:09:55.060
eh, half of it was the way they had this store,

165
00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.930
like the way they had the store set up. It's just like,

166
00:10:00.220 --> 00:10:03.970
it was so fucked up. It's like who was, that guy was in Manhattan,

167
00:10:04.540 --> 00:10:08.740
the crown jewel of fucking cities in the United States.

168
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.790
Right. And the second I walked into fucking TJ Max,

169
00:10:13.870 --> 00:10:16.840
I mean I might as well at a fucking Walmart in the middle of nowhere.

170
00:10:16.840 --> 00:10:21.030
And I am talking down to middle America and their Walmarts.

171
00:10:21.050 --> 00:10:23.170
I am talking down to it, although I'm not actually,

172
00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:26.770
you know those Walmart's aren't that bad other than on black Friday.

173
00:10:26.771 --> 00:10:31.750
Black Friday is the day you don't want to fucking go down there cause that's

174
00:10:31.751 --> 00:10:35.500
like white people, bloods and crips, you know,

175
00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:36.760
that's our version of it.

176
00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.100
It's flannels and fucking in flip flops.

177
00:10:42.910 --> 00:10:43.330
That's,

178
00:10:43.330 --> 00:10:47.290
that's our bloods and crips and you don't still want to be there on that day.

179
00:10:47.291 --> 00:10:52.060
You know when they have one Atari for $3 way in the back of the store and

180
00:10:52.061 --> 00:10:55.600
everybody's just basically going to trample people like they go into the fucking

181
00:10:55.601 --> 00:10:59.590
who concert Cincinnati way back in the day there. I mean other than that,

182
00:11:00.820 --> 00:11:02.680
you know, it's not, it's not that bad a store,

183
00:11:04.030 --> 00:11:04.863
<v 2>you know,</v>

184
00:11:05.540 --> 00:11:08.450
<v 0>it's got all kinds of food, giant selections.</v>

185
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:10.940
I've gone in there a bunch of times. I don't know why I brought that up.

186
00:11:10.941 --> 00:11:14.380
I just don't know what the fuck I'm talking about this point. Oh, TJ Max,

187
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:19.010
you get the Max Boulder man number with TJ Max.

188
00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:21.650
Um, so I go in there and it's, you know,

189
00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.580
typical Manhattan fucking store where it's like half the stores downstairs and

190
00:11:25.581 --> 00:11:29.900
the other is on the ground floor and the others is like upstairs, you know,

191
00:11:30.050 --> 00:11:32.000
cause they slammed this little fucking store in there

192
00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:33.863
<v 2>and um,</v>

193
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:39.720
<v 0>finally find some underwears and uh, I'm like, fuck,</v>

194
00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:43.080
I gotta stand in this God damn like Disneyland level line. And like, all right,

195
00:11:43.081 --> 00:11:48.060
they got 12 fucking registers open. So even though there's like 24 people,

196
00:11:48.330 --> 00:11:49.050
you know,

197
00:11:49.050 --> 00:11:53.200
roughly each one of these cashiers just knocks out two people and then it's my

198
00:11:53.201 --> 00:11:56.050
turn. All right, this shouldn't be this bad.

199
00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.980
And it was this woman in front of me. I don't know what kind of soap she used,

200
00:11:59.981 --> 00:12:04.120
but like I would divorce her, I swear to God, even if she made my heart stop,

201
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.010
I'd be like, I love you. I wish nothing for you. But this fucking soap,

202
00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.620
it's a specific soap. I've smelled it before. It wasn't, she didn't smell bad.

203
00:12:14.621 --> 00:12:18.730
She smelled of this soap. I don't know what the fuck it is, but it just,

204
00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.020
I can't be around it,

205
00:12:20.021 --> 00:12:23.500
but I had to be or else someone's going to cut me and then they just walked you

206
00:12:24.070 --> 00:12:26.590
through, you know the Disneyland thing where you walk all the way to the right.

207
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:29.530
Then you go back to the left, you know, zigzag and all the way up. It just the,

208
00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:33.620
this shit that they had, you know,

209
00:12:33.621 --> 00:12:37.640
the impulse buys in everybody. If they weren't staring at their fucking phones.

210
00:12:38.850 --> 00:12:42.700
We're just picking up these things and the more I saw people picking up this

211
00:12:42.701 --> 00:12:46.040
shit, looking at it like the angry or I was getting like,

212
00:12:46.041 --> 00:12:47.750
why are you picking that up? You don't need that.

213
00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:51.740
Let me find you the names of these fucking things. Okay.

214
00:12:51.741 --> 00:12:55.670
They had this one thing that said I would thank you from the bottom of my heart,

215
00:12:56.750 --> 00:12:59.540
but for you, my heart has no bottom.

216
00:13:00.440 --> 00:13:03.500
And it was just framed in this piece of shit,

217
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.610
wood frame and on a white piece of paper with just regular font.

218
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:13.140
Like please don't walk away with the bathroom key, like the same kind of font.

219
00:13:13.141 --> 00:13:16.320
You would use it that at the gas station they wrote that fucking cheesy

220
00:13:16.321 --> 00:13:20.250
heartfelt message. And what the fuck was the next one?

221
00:13:22.080 --> 00:13:23.250
Oh, it was just some sort of like,

222
00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:25.050
<v 4>okay,</v>

223
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.460
<v 0>coconut, Allman, yummy clusters or something was called that. I know.</v>

224
00:13:30.620 --> 00:13:31.453
<v 4>Okay.</v>

225
00:13:31.630 --> 00:13:34.140
<v 0>That's how I was guilty. This is like, this is the demographic come in, let's,</v>

226
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:36.390
let's become Fed Fox and talk about how we love each other.

227
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:38.240
I don't want to talk about,

228
00:13:38.240 --> 00:13:40.800
so I'll get the underwear and I fucking get back to the hotel room.

229
00:13:40.801 --> 00:13:44.190
And I realize in my looking down at everybody and TJ Max,

230
00:13:44.191 --> 00:13:48.420
I forgot to get socks so I had to go back to the gay store, you know?

231
00:13:49.510 --> 00:13:49.820
<v 4>Yeah.</v>

232
00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:50.960
<v 0>And, um, you know,</v>

233
00:13:50.961 --> 00:13:54.080
I come walking into the store and the same dudes behind the counter and I was

234
00:13:54.081 --> 00:13:58.130
just like, dude, you got a, you sell socks here, you know,

235
00:13:58.131 --> 00:13:59.300
cause all they had was white socks.

236
00:13:59.310 --> 00:14:01.370
I was gonna sit down at church and they were gonna come up and they were like

237
00:14:01.400 --> 00:14:04.310
ankles, like Nike socks. I was gonna wear with like fucking wink tips.

238
00:14:04.311 --> 00:14:07.340
I wasn't gonna do that. So they actually had regular socks.

239
00:14:07.850 --> 00:14:11.840
So that's what I learned at the gay store. They just had regular Nike socks,

240
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:16.700
but for some reason the tag on him took a picture of it.

241
00:14:16.940 --> 00:14:18.380
I gotta send this, I'm going to want, you know what,

242
00:14:18.381 --> 00:14:19.670
I'm going to tweet this out or whatever.

243
00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:24.920
The tag on the socks just said bitch police. There's just some,

244
00:14:25.610 --> 00:14:29.480
I guess woman or maybe a guy in drag with his face all twisted up.

245
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:35.480
Um, I got on bitch please. Socks by Nike, you know, and they feel normal.

246
00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:38.750
These are made for gay feet, but for some reason they seem to fit mine just,

247
00:14:39.380 --> 00:14:43.910
just fine. I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. Um,

248
00:14:43.911 --> 00:14:48.020
I mentioned earlier that I hadn't been meditating and it came to a, a head,

249
00:14:48.050 --> 00:14:50.990
so to speak. And uh, remember when I was bitching,

250
00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:55.130
updating my fucking phone and then trying to update my laptop and there's no one

251
00:14:55.131 --> 00:14:58.820
to call and I'm typing in the right passwords and the two are not in sync and I

252
00:14:58.821 --> 00:14:59.660
don't know how to do it.

253
00:15:00.860 --> 00:15:05.860
I finally had a meltdown and my laptop was closed and I took my phone and I just

254
00:15:08.271 --> 00:15:13.271
fucking slammed it down like corner first onto my laptop,

255
00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:17.780
you know, somewhere between a jab and an overhand. Right.

256
00:15:17.781 --> 00:15:20.990
But it was a stabbing motion and uh,

257
00:15:22.630 --> 00:15:23.463
<v 2>I don't know what.</v>

258
00:15:24.330 --> 00:15:27.180
<v 0>Then I fucking opened my laptop and the screen was broken.</v>

259
00:15:27.570 --> 00:15:31.210
So my question I have for you guys, it's not,

260
00:15:31.211 --> 00:15:34.180
do I need anger management? I know I do. My question is,

261
00:15:34.181 --> 00:15:36.700
is can people have just fix the fucking screens? You can do that.

262
00:15:36.701 --> 00:15:40.990
It's not the hard drive. There was no water get, they just take that out.

263
00:15:40.991 --> 00:15:43.090
It's like, I've got a broken windshield on my laptop. Can they,

264
00:15:43.091 --> 00:15:46.570
can they do that? I'm going to find out, I'm going to find out.

265
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.060
Cause once again I didn't back up anything there and I was just really thinking

266
00:15:49.061 --> 00:15:51.760
like I didn't back anything up and I didn't back anything up my phone when I

267
00:15:51.761 --> 00:15:56.700
dropped it in the toilet. But do I miss any of that data, data, whatever.

268
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.050
How was the fuck you say it? And the reality is is I don't,

269
00:16:00.450 --> 00:16:03.670
I mean most of my pictures is taking pictures of shit that I hate. You know,

270
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:09.990
people's dirty feet and fucking heartfelt photos and gay socks that say,

271
00:16:10.241 --> 00:16:13.060
Bitch, please let me do, I do I really need to save these somewhere.

272
00:16:13.810 --> 00:16:16.510
I just love the idea that these exists somewhere in a cloud in this,

273
00:16:16.750 --> 00:16:20.530
these fucking people trying to figure out with the shit that I take a picture

274
00:16:20.531 --> 00:16:24.490
of. Like what can they sell me next? K Gay socks,

275
00:16:24.491 --> 00:16:26.530
coconut clusters.

276
00:16:27.960 --> 00:16:30.450
I would thank you from the bottom of my heart, but for you,

277
00:16:30.451 --> 00:16:32.070
my heart has no problem. Okay.

278
00:16:32.071 --> 00:16:36.090
This is a fat gay male with a sugar addiction.

279
00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:37.690
<v 2>Okay.</v>

280
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:38.620
<v 0>And a foot fetish.</v>

281
00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.170
Um, anyway, so I got to read. Um, oh, by the way,

282
00:16:47.171 --> 00:16:49.570
my daughter laughed for the first time yesterday,

283
00:16:49.571 --> 00:16:52.960
twice and I was on the road and I didn't get to see, I didn't get to hear it,

284
00:16:52.961 --> 00:16:57.670
but, um, I'm hanging out with her all, all day today,

285
00:16:58.270 --> 00:17:02.170
um, other than the benefit I have to do tonight and I'm really like psyched.

286
00:17:02.230 --> 00:17:06.880
Like, um, I came home and of course dropped everything and picked her up and um,

287
00:17:08.550 --> 00:17:11.580
she just smiled for like three minutes straight, which was amazing.

288
00:17:12.330 --> 00:17:15.450
And I could tell she was getting sleepy and I can read her body language.

289
00:17:15.451 --> 00:17:17.220
She was on the floor and she started doing this thing,

290
00:17:17.221 --> 00:17:20.200
like she's trying to sit up and my God, she wants to get up and I,

291
00:17:20.201 --> 00:17:22.660
I just put her on my lap and we were watching, um,

292
00:17:23.730 --> 00:17:28.040
these people in Maine rebuilding cabins or some shit and um,

293
00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:31.050
I felt they start to slump slumped to the right.

294
00:17:31.050 --> 00:17:35.160
And I knew that she was falling asleep and she was asleep, which as I was like,

295
00:17:35.161 --> 00:17:37.080
this is a perfect time to do the podcast,

296
00:17:37.110 --> 00:17:39.540
but felt so awesome her just laying there.

297
00:17:39.690 --> 00:17:42.580
Then I stayed there for like another 20 minutes and I'm,

298
00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:48.680
I'm kind of breaking down parenting into just like sections where I know like I

299
00:17:49.561 --> 00:17:53.760
was like, alright, I got 18 years with her before she goes off to college.

300
00:17:53.761 --> 00:17:57.990
God willing, so how many months is that? I just did three of them.

301
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.630
And then the other big countdown is the first three years.

302
00:18:00.631 --> 00:18:02.130
So the first three years,

303
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000
all I have to do is just fill her up with love support.

304
00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.550
And when I do lose my temper because I'm going to,

305
00:18:11.551 --> 00:18:15.090
I'm going to do apologize to her and ask her to help me work on it.

306
00:18:15.480 --> 00:18:19.340
So she's not like necessarily afraid, you know, I just don't,

307
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:20.670
I got to kill this, uh,

308
00:18:21.390 --> 00:18:25.140
this aspect of my family tree cause everything else is pretty, uh, you know,

309
00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.040
acceptable.

310
00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:30.330
But I don't want to be the guy stabbing his fucking laptop with his phone,

311
00:18:30.331 --> 00:18:32.070
freaking his kid out. Do I do, you know,

312
00:18:32.071 --> 00:18:36.480
who wants to be that person and you lay it on your death bed one day and they

313
00:18:36.481 --> 00:18:37.590
come walking and you know,

314
00:18:37.591 --> 00:18:41.110
peaking and still nervous to be around you just be like, yeah, sorry. Yeah,

315
00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:46.420
<v 5>sure. I go for my phone back or day to day too.</v>

316
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:49.970
<v 0>I didn't want to have that. So, um, yeah,</v>

317
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.750
I'm hanging out with her all day today, reading books and the whole thing.

318
00:18:53.751 --> 00:18:55.820
So I've also decided like, all right,

319
00:18:55.821 --> 00:18:59.870
so I still gotta do my two weekends a month. So those would be like six days.

320
00:18:59.871 --> 00:19:00.704
I won't see her,

321
00:19:00.770 --> 00:19:05.330
but I'll actually see her more than if I had like a nine to five because then I

322
00:19:05.331 --> 00:19:08.840
can come home and just totally focus on her, you know,

323
00:19:08.841 --> 00:19:13.280
for the next 10 days before I go out on the road. So, you know,

324
00:19:13.310 --> 00:19:16.310
and every person that's apparently, I'll say it goes by so fast,

325
00:19:16.311 --> 00:19:20.730
it goes by so fast. So I just keep thinking that every fucking time. Um,

326
00:19:21.900 --> 00:19:25.520
every day. So hopefully, hopefully, you know, hopefully I don't fuck this up,

327
00:19:25.521 --> 00:19:29.360
but I'm not gonna lie to you. I know I'm a mess, so I'm definitely a,

328
00:19:30.580 --> 00:19:35.510
you know, Jerry's out. Hey, people walk around with great debt. I'm a great dad.

329
00:19:35.511 --> 00:19:38.300
Shut the fuck up. That's not for you to say. Somebody says that to you.

330
00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:43.380
You can't. Um, you know, he's awesome. You know who's awesome?

00:20:40.360 --> 00:20:44.230
For anyone that doesn't know Lewis Black, he's a comedy hero,

346
00:20:44.410 --> 00:20:46.180
a regular on the daily show.

347
00:20:46.330 --> 00:20:50.050
He's got stand up specials on HBO and Comedy Central.

348
00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:54.940
He's the voice of anger in inside out and he's got over a million fans

349
00:20:54.941 --> 00:20:58.390
connecting every day on social media. Uh,

350
00:20:59.170 --> 00:21:01.000
I remember the first time I saw Louis Black,

351
00:21:01.001 --> 00:21:05.980
I saw him at the comedy cellar right before he blew up. He was about my age,

352
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:10.480
maybe a little young, about 45 46 and it was one of those fucking hot,

353
00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:15.570
brutally hot summer days in La.

354
00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.570
And he came in still wearing his sport coat and all that and he was just like

355
00:21:20.630 --> 00:21:23.000
miserable. Okay.

356
00:21:23.030 --> 00:21:26.030
He already walks around with a certain level of agitation,

357
00:21:26.031 --> 00:21:27.770
which I could totally relate to is,

358
00:21:27.771 --> 00:21:32.771
remember I said I walk around at a six so going up to 10 isn't that quick of a

359
00:21:32.930 --> 00:21:33.763
ride.

360
00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:37.940
So Louis came in and there was like nobody in the fucking club.

361
00:21:38.210 --> 00:21:39.590
It was like the mid nineties,

362
00:21:39.591 --> 00:21:43.550
like 95 96 and comedy was still dealing with the eighties hangover,

363
00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.630
still waiting to make another comeback. And uh,

364
00:21:46.631 --> 00:21:50.230
so he goes in there in front of like three fucking people, I don't know,

365
00:21:50.260 --> 00:21:51.680
three tables of people, whatever.

366
00:21:52.550 --> 00:21:57.550
And I had never seen him and he got in there and he was legit upset about how

367
00:22:00.451 --> 00:22:01.890
fucking hot it was outside.

368
00:22:01.891 --> 00:22:06.540
And then you combine that with his material and his stage persona and he got

369
00:22:06.541 --> 00:22:09.360
that finger going and it was like,

370
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:14.340
I'll never forget that I was fucking dying.

371
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:17.760
This guy where he is in front of like 11 people murdering,

372
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:21.300
like he was at Carnegie Hall and um,

373
00:22:22.170 --> 00:22:25.320
that was just one of those great Jett just moved to New York and it was just one

374
00:22:25.321 --> 00:22:28.980
of those great, oh my God, who the fuck is this guy?

375
00:22:29.490 --> 00:22:31.350
How have I never seen this guy?

376
00:22:31.710 --> 00:22:34.680
How doesn't everybody know who this guy is?

377
00:22:34.710 --> 00:22:37.380
And within like that was like 95,

378
00:22:37.381 --> 00:22:40.650
96 and I want to say he hit around like 99.

379
00:22:40.651 --> 00:22:45.651
It was quick within like by 1999 I think he went on the road and he did that.

380
00:22:47.250 --> 00:22:51.810
Um, that classic comedy tour lineup. It was him,

381
00:22:51.811 --> 00:22:56.700
Mitch Hedberg and David Tell. Can you believe that that was a fucking tour. Hey,

382
00:22:56.701 --> 00:22:59.190
we're going to go out and go see comedy tonight. Oh yeah. Who are you seeing?

383
00:22:59.490 --> 00:22:59.940
I Dunno,

384
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:04.940
this guy a Lewis black this up and coming guy.

385
00:23:06.660 --> 00:23:10.830
Mitch Heg Hedberg I'm trying to think of a David tell had his show yet. Um,

386
00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:12.420
and I think he had insomniac.

387
00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:14.700
<v 1>Okay.</v>

388
00:23:14.700 --> 00:23:16.810
<v 0>Maybe Mitch had his half hour out, but um,</v>

389
00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.560
I didn't even get to see that fucking talk cause I was too busy slugging it out

390
00:23:20.561 --> 00:23:24.430
my fucking hell rooms. I would have loved to have seen that. Um, so anyways,

391
00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:26.680
so I'm sitting here babbling. I supposed to be reading a

392
00:23:29.300 --> 00:23:31.970
advertise. I'm telling the stories like frame bridge, everybody.

393
00:23:33.530 --> 00:23:34.010
<v 1>Okay.</v>

394
00:23:34.010 --> 00:23:38.480
<v 0>So weird. I just shot one day on a movie in Framingham, Framingham,</v>

395
00:23:38.481 --> 00:23:41.720
Massachusetts, out there on fucking off of route nine. I believe.

396
00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.220
I used to do the Nixon Framingham out there a long time ago. Over 20 years.

397
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.200
Way they go, all right, frame bridge. Everybody.

398
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:52.310
Give your personal experience using frame bridge.com if applicable.

399
00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:55.370
I've never used it. It sounds like a great idea,

400
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.400
but I stabbed my fucking blacktop in the face,

401
00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.590
stabbed it in the face. I always have to say in the face,

402
00:24:02.990 --> 00:24:05.620
you know what that's from? That's from, uh,

403
00:24:05.650 --> 00:24:10.340
the great performance giver by that cop in the bathroom in reservoir dogs.

404
00:24:10.790 --> 00:24:15.400
The way he, the rhythm of the way he speaks is so like perfect cop.

405
00:24:16.040 --> 00:24:20.270
I said, buddy, I am going to shoot you in the face.

406
00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:23.110
You don't put your fucking ears in a dashboard.

407
00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:29.800
That's one of those movies when you've seen it that many times,

408
00:24:29.830 --> 00:24:34.630
like all the usual good lines that everybody quotes out of the fucking blue.

409
00:24:34.631 --> 00:24:36.370
You know, I'm trying to be a fucking professional.

410
00:24:37.240 --> 00:24:41.460
You always got big killed asshole. All those ones that everybody knows.

411
00:24:42.630 --> 00:24:45.360
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam, Bam,

412
00:24:45.900 --> 00:24:49.810
look at damn and done what I told them not to do. Um,

413
00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.890
everybody knows those lines. But then once you want, once you get up to like,

414
00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:55.260
you know, three, 400 viewings of it,

415
00:24:56.370 --> 00:24:59.830
which you really can do on a summer if you fucking put your mind to it and you

416
00:24:59.940 --> 00:25:02.730
just, you have no social life like me. Yeah. That's when you start going,

417
00:25:02.731 --> 00:25:07.410
who the fuck is this guy playing this cop? The way he's killing this monologue.

418
00:25:08.730 --> 00:25:11.640
Um, I dunno, I dunno why.

419
00:25:12.150 --> 00:25:16.230
It just reminded me of this comedian Denny live from Philly and I remember when

420
00:25:16.231 --> 00:25:20.280
he was, he was doing this white guy, Dan is a black dude.

421
00:25:20.280 --> 00:25:23.670
So he's doing this white guy. And the way he was doing the cadence and the way,

422
00:25:23.700 --> 00:25:27.000
the way the guy was talking was a, you know,

423
00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.930
that was like sort of a, at the height of the fallout of the hacky white,

424
00:25:31.931 --> 00:25:34.730
white guy. Like, wow, Geez, I got it. They'll do my taxes,

425
00:25:34.731 --> 00:25:38.210
like that fucking thing. But he was actually legitimately doing a white guy,

426
00:25:39.620 --> 00:25:41.560
like an impression that I couldn't even fucking do.

427
00:25:41.580 --> 00:25:45.380
But I could see the dude that he was doing. Um, I don't know those,

428
00:25:45.381 --> 00:25:47.930
those are the nerd things that I like when I'm watching shit. But anyways,

429
00:25:47.931 --> 00:25:51.800

which is right below. You know what I means between you and your titties.

465
00:28:09.870 --> 00:28:12.960
The OCB there, I'm

466
00:28:15.030 --> 00:28:18.850
sorry, Blue Apron. Everybody. See,

467
00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.170
remember that fucking movie that was just up on the CB was just above fucking

468
00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:27.540
truckers. Kris Kristofferson was, was in it. And uh,

469
00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:32.760
Ernest Borgnine was, was the state trooper up there in the helicopter convoy.

470
00:28:34.230 --> 00:28:38.220
And I remember they were trying to get this fucking convoy of trucks to just

471
00:28:38.221 --> 00:28:41.250
stop driving. It was like vanishing point with like 70,

472
00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.910
72,000 fucking 18 wheelers. They just were,

473
00:28:44.911 --> 00:28:46.680
they weren't stopping for nothing man.

474
00:28:46.681 --> 00:28:48.960
They were just out there and they were just gonna keep on driving.

475
00:28:49.590 --> 00:28:52.650
So these cops were trying to stop them and they for some reason couldn't send

476
00:28:52.651 --> 00:28:55.980
out Ernest Borgnine, you know, sort of the go between,

477
00:28:55.981 --> 00:28:58.170
between truckers and cops. Like he understands them.

478
00:28:58.470 --> 00:29:02.430
So there's some kind of up in the elevator going, hey, you fucking truckers.

479
00:29:02.580 --> 00:29:06.120
This is, this is, the police were up here in the helicopter. I,

480
00:29:06.121 --> 00:29:08.040
we really don't have a gun turn or anything,

481
00:29:08.041 --> 00:29:10.800
but we're watching you so you better be nervous. You know,

482
00:29:10.801 --> 00:29:13.260
he's trying to make threats up there in this fucking helicopter.

483
00:29:14.370 --> 00:29:17.200
So Ernest Borgnine, it just shakes his head. He goes,

484
00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.870
that ain't going gonna listen to that. And he grabs the CBG, Aziz truckers,

485
00:29:21.871 --> 00:29:24.060
he goes, they got a language all their own.

486
00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.820
And then he goes to talk to them down there and he goes,

487
00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:30.240
this is the bear in the air.

488
00:29:33.460 --> 00:29:37.350
Now I forget how he delivered that line. I even fucked it up.

489
00:29:37.351 --> 00:29:42.280
This is the bear in the air, like smokey the bear,

490
00:29:42.340 --> 00:29:45.690
you know, smokey the cop and all that. Do I have to break it down to, you know,

491
00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:48.310
that's one of the things that I can't fucking stand. I hate

492
00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:53.150
when obvious slang people feel that they have to break it down to,

493
00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:54.670
you know what I mean?

494
00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:57.430
I remember one time I saw this one man show and the guy goes,

495
00:29:57.431 --> 00:29:59.620
we were going into Maddie Hattie. He goes,

496
00:29:59.621 --> 00:30:02.530
that's Manhattan for all you white people. I want to be like, oh,

497
00:30:04.750 --> 00:30:08.430
I couldn't figure that one out. I was so clever.

498
00:30:09.730 --> 00:30:14.290
I mean, you're almost saying man at and of course I got to laugh.

499
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.030
White people, they don't understand things. Um, all right, let's get, what am I?

500
00:30:20.410 --> 00:30:24.730
Am I technically in the middle of a reed here? All right. Blue Apron. Yeah.

501
00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.730
All right. Yeah. This is about food and aprons. Okay.

502
00:30:27.731 --> 00:30:32.110
Blue aprons mission is to make incredible home cooking accessible to everyone.

503
00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:36.430
All right? It's about time. Up until in the bottom until blue apron,

504
00:30:36.431 --> 00:30:41.080
only the upper 1% were allowed to have food prepared for them while the rest of

505
00:30:41.081 --> 00:30:42.550
us were fucking non on bushes.

506
00:30:43.070 --> 00:30:47.440
A because blue apron ships the exact amount of each ingredient required for the

507
00:30:47.441 --> 00:30:51.370
recipe. You better not fucking spill anything. Uh, no.

508
00:30:51.470 --> 00:30:53.020
They are reducing food waste

509
00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.130
because it's the exact amount you pour. Bastards.

510
00:30:57.131 --> 00:31:00.580
You're going to be like a crack head crawling around a motel fucking floor

511
00:31:00.581 --> 00:31:04.990
looking for a rock. Did the Bazell go under the bed? Uh,

512
00:31:04.991 --> 00:31:08.550
cooking together. Build strong family bonds, juniors.

513
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:13.090
It's time to put in the sugar. Research shows. Research.

514
00:31:13.150 --> 00:31:17.950
Research shows that Blue Apron families cook nearly three times more often.

515
00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:23.820
Those who spend a lot at restaurants or at high end grocery stores can now spend

516

How great is that fucking advertising campaign?

532
00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.850
I've never had a desire to eat there ever. It's like I don't want fast food.

533
00:32:30.851 --> 00:32:31.684
Roast beef.

534
00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:35.890
Does anything fucking die quicker than fucking roast beef?

535
00:32:36.220 --> 00:32:38.770
I mean I know it's dead already. You know,

536

538

They really are. Um, all of them. Every single one of them.

539
00:32:51.441 --> 00:32:54.440
I put them all in one group cause that's what I do cause I don't take the time

540
00:32:54.441 --> 00:32:58.250
to get to know people. Okay. And right now it's,

541
00:32:58.320 --> 00:33:02.090
I think this country needs a little more of that, don't you? All right. CSO,

I tried to do it like Michael Buffer. Um, Bruce buffer.

559
00:34:14.661 --> 00:34:18.570
Actually I was trying to do Bruce buffer and the new season of big Jay Oakerson

560
00:34:18.610 --> 00:34:19.700
is what's your fucking deal?

Pronounced Faheem aren't on war, dude.

563
00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:31.280
You know what does everybody have to start big Jay Oakerson show?

564
00:34:31.281 --> 00:34:34.640
Do you have to say what's your fucking deal? You gotta say it. I mean,

565
00:34:34.641 --> 00:34:38.720
it's almost like a game show, right? All of it higher.

566
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.510
You know this, there's certain things that you have to say.

567
00:34:42.560 --> 00:34:45.590
I can't think of a catch phrase from a game show anyways. Hey Bill.

568
00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:47.990
The show's already a hit. It's in its second season.

569
00:34:47.991 --> 00:34:51.290
They don't need you fucking retooling it. It's like some ghost producer.

570
00:34:51.410 --> 00:34:52.950
Fair enough. All right.

571
00:34:53.900 --> 00:34:58.280
Excess CSO content from anywhere at anytime using Ios, android,

00:35:02.210 --> 00:35:06.830
Amazon fire TV. That sounds like a bad fucking, I dunno.

Ready for the pump x, Xbox one. Sorry. Ready for the punch line.

576
00:35:15.290 --> 00:35:16.970
I thought one ready was the name of one of those things.

577
00:35:17.330 --> 00:35:21.920
Ready for the punchline? Yes, Bill. We are. CSO is just three 99 per month.

590
00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:16.570
all right. Okay. Oh Jesus, Boston sports. Let's Talk Boston Sports,

591
00:36:17.500 --> 00:36:21.130
Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah, Dah. I'm Jesus.

592
00:36:21.131 --> 00:36:24.130
What a couple of fucking games those were. Um, all right,

593
00:36:24.131 --> 00:36:25.990
let's start with the Boston Bruins.

594
00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:30.620
We've lost three games straight to the Ottawa Saturdays.

595
00:36:31.650 --> 00:36:33.320
Um, I missed the, um,

596
00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:37.720
I miss yesterday night's game cause I was at the memorial service,

597
00:36:37.721 --> 00:36:40.240
but I definitely watch game two and game three.

598
00:36:40.840 --> 00:36:44.830
And although we had a furious got back and gave three, it was not enough.

599
00:36:45.400 --> 00:36:46.780
I was actually in the north end,

600
00:36:47.450 --> 00:36:52.090
in the cigar bar smoking his stogy hoping it was going to be a good thing.

601
00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:55.540
Um, what a fucking, that was a great goal though.

602
00:36:55.541 --> 00:37:00.190
And over time that'll give and go gotta admit and uh, I dunno,

603
00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:04.570
I dunno. They just been outplaying us and they, they deserve it.

604
00:37:04.571 --> 00:37:08.980
Now granted it was a shit call, but there's going to be shit calls.

605
00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:12.580
It's just going to happen. But, uh, you know,

606
00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:17.550
I dunno, Shit, call a no shit call. We've lost three games in a row.

607
00:37:17.551 --> 00:37:20.040
So I mean it all, you can only look in the mirror.

608
00:37:20.610 --> 00:37:23.280
So we'll see what happens. Um,

609
00:37:24.210 --> 00:37:28.230
the excitement of the Bruins making the playoffs is quickly subsiding here.

610
00:37:28.890 --> 00:37:32.350
I would like to see them win a series and now they're there.

611
00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:36.150
You got their fucking backs up against the wall. So we'll see. We'll see.

612
00:37:36.240 --> 00:37:39.930
We'll see when game five comes up, I imagine tomorrow. All right.

613
00:37:39.931 --> 00:37:42.150
And then the Celtics, oh,

614
00:37:42.151 --> 00:37:45.540
Jesus Celtics have been completely exposed.

615
00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:48.300
I know that that's probably been said a thousand times.

616
00:37:48.301 --> 00:37:51.420
You know what's funny is when I first got back into the NBA,

617
00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:55.710
which I got back into it cause Paul [inaudible] was coming out here and he loves

618
00:37:55.711 --> 00:37:57.180
the NBA and he was staying with me,

619
00:37:57.181 --> 00:38:01.800
him and his lovely wife staying with me and my lovely wife for like four or five

620
00:38:01.801 --> 00:38:06.240
days. And uh, I'm a hell of a host. Oh, what a host. What a host. Right?

621
00:38:06.630 --> 00:38:10.050
So I'm just like, all right, well, you know I would. Versus coming to town,

622
00:38:10.051 --> 00:38:11.460
I got to get some Johnny blue,

623
00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:14.430
I got to get the NBA package so he can watch his Nixon.

624
00:38:14.431 --> 00:38:15.870
I just got into the Celtics,

625
00:38:15.871 --> 00:38:20.871
so I've been watching them since December of 2015 and my first thought when I

626
00:38:21.241 --> 00:38:24.570
was watching them, I was like, where are we going to go with this game plan?

627
00:38:25.610 --> 00:38:27.420
We have the superstar point guard,

628
00:38:28.320 --> 00:38:31.710
we live and die by the three and we don't get any fucking rebounds.

629
00:38:31.711 --> 00:38:33.720
Like I don't understand how you can win

630
00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:36.430
<v 6>anything</v>

631
00:38:36.430 --> 00:38:39.130
<v 0>playing basketball like that. But then here's what happened.</v>

632
00:38:39.160 --> 00:38:43.630
They did and they just kept winning and everybody else,

633
00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:48.720
it just became socially acceptable on the hardcourt to fucking run down the

634
00:38:50.591 --> 00:38:52.090
court with the ball.

635
00:38:52.091 --> 00:38:55.940
Three people from the other team or under the net.

636
00:38:55.970 --> 00:38:59.600
Nobody on your team or maybe one guy. It was totally acceptable to say,

637
00:38:59.601 --> 00:39:02.540
I'm not waiting for my other teammates and I'm just going to launch a fucking

638
00:39:02.541 --> 00:39:06.920
three, you know? And we're up by one with like fucking eight minutes to go like,

639
00:39:06.921 --> 00:39:10.190
what are you doing? But that just, you know,

640
00:39:11.330 --> 00:39:13.460
the same way after Jordan, people were just like, well,

641
00:39:13.461 --> 00:39:15.380
I guess we don't need to feed it to a big man.

642
00:39:15.381 --> 00:39:18.230
I do even need a big man ready yet, you know? And so I was like, all right,

643
00:39:18.231 --> 00:39:19.490
I guess this is the new game.

644
00:39:20.570 --> 00:39:25.570
So we ended up not only doing great this year once we added Al Horford yeah,

645
00:39:26.361 --> 00:39:28.790
we fucking got the number one seed.

646
00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:34.330
And at that point I completely forgot about my initial reaction to the way that,

647
00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:38.870
that they were playing. And I was like, all right, I guess, yeah.

648
00:39:39.770 --> 00:39:42.080
With the number one seed we get an eight seat. All right.

649
00:39:42.710 --> 00:39:47.070
And after the first two games, it's like a, you know,

650
00:39:47.071 --> 00:39:48.210
it seems like the opposite.

651
00:39:48.211 --> 00:39:50.280
Seems like they're the number one seed and we're the eight seed.

652
00:39:50.310 --> 00:39:52.590
And I kind of knew we were in trouble.

653
00:39:54.750 --> 00:39:55.583
<v 2>Uh,</v>

654
00:39:56.030 --> 00:39:56.863
<v 0>I guess,</v>

655
00:39:56.870 --> 00:40:01.130
well when Charles Barkley just basically broke our team down after the first

656
00:40:01.131 --> 00:40:03.260
half of the first game going, yeah,

657
00:40:03.261 --> 00:40:07.100
you just basically you'd double team Isaiah tried to make him beat the double

658
00:40:07.101 --> 00:40:10.250
and then if these guys don't hit their threes, you know,

659
00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:12.020
they're not getting any fuck. I don't know what the hell he said,

660
00:40:12.021 --> 00:40:14.120
but it's just like, all right, this guy's already figured this out.

661
00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:17.650
Basically what I'm saying is, um,

662
00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:20.330
I think this is the first real test for Brad Stevens,

663
00:40:20.570 --> 00:40:25.280
this next game where he has to make a drastic adjustment with the players that

664
00:40:25.281 --> 00:40:30.281
he has because they figured this out before the opening tip off and that has led

665
00:40:31.611 --> 00:40:34.970
to two losses and we have not been able to make any adjustment.

666
00:40:35.930 --> 00:40:36.980
And um,

667
00:40:37.010 --> 00:40:40.250
what's fascinating about the bowls is even though that they're in eighth seed,

668
00:40:40.251 --> 00:40:45.050
they got Rondeau and they got Dwayne Wade and Rondo's got a ring and I think

669
00:40:45.051 --> 00:40:49.190
Dwayne Wade, he's got what? Three rings, four rings, he won,

670
00:40:49.191 --> 00:40:53.060
one was shack and then two with Lebron three with Lebron. I can't remember.

671
00:40:53.061 --> 00:40:54.870
I'm not a big NBA guy. He's got at least three rings.

672
00:40:54.871 --> 00:40:57.770
So there's four rings right there. Those guys,

673
00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.950
I've been through it numerous times, so they're not afraid of the,

674
00:41:03.010 --> 00:41:06.680
the ebbs and flows of the game. They're not afraid of playing on the road.

675
00:41:06.820 --> 00:41:11.330
They are just totally chill and I think that affects the rest of the team.

676
00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:15.470
And then he got Butler and Lopez who have just fucking animals just hitting,

677
00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:21.830
you know, 12 foot jump shots, 15 photos while getting all these rebounds.

678
00:41:21.831 --> 00:41:26.831
And then that fucking white dude from Europe Vladi devakt Jr de voc jr he is

679
00:41:27.741 --> 00:41:32.560
fucking started hitting threes and um, you know,

680
00:41:32.590 --> 00:41:34.460
we're getting our asses kicked, so

681
00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.330
<v 1>I'll see what happens if you know. But, uh,</v>

682
00:41:40.110 --> 00:41:43.560
<v 0>Jesus Christ, I mean, we were down three to one in hockey and went down,</v>

683
00:41:43.710 --> 00:41:48.300
oh two going out to Chicago. So I'm hoping, I'm,

684
00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:53.020
I'm hoping, yeah, Jesus. So we don't get fucking swept. I mean, yeah,

685
00:41:54.750 --> 00:41:57.150
I dunno. Brutal, brutal, brutal. But you know,

686
00:41:57.151 --> 00:41:59.190
what are you gonna do with [inaudible]? It's just a fucking game.

687
00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:02.430
I realized that if the first one when I'm watching, you know,

688
00:42:02.790 --> 00:42:06.930
Isaiah Thomas crying about losing his sister was really a brutal week for that

689
00:42:06.931 --> 00:42:10.080
type of shit. Huh. And Aaron Hernandez hung himself. Man,

690
00:42:10.081 --> 00:42:12.270
that was fucking brutal. The whole thing was brutal.

691
00:42:12.510 --> 00:42:17.060
And then all those fucking jokes that people were making like, oh yeah,

692
00:42:17.220 --> 00:42:21.750
he got hung up. He's got an upper body injury to the fucking neck.

693
00:42:21.870 --> 00:42:26.160
Oh, all this dumb shit. Um, that,

694
00:42:26.190 --> 00:42:28.590
that shit to me is always weird. Where are going to say, oh,

695
00:42:28.591 --> 00:42:32.910
that guy's a murderer. He's a fucking piece of shit. And uh,

696
00:42:32.970 --> 00:42:37.560
and then everybody acts like a fucking animal when he kills himself. Um,

697
00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:40.590
of course there's people out there that don't, that think, you know,

698
00:42:40.591 --> 00:42:42.720
something else happened. It's like, all right,

699
00:42:42.721 --> 00:42:46.440
you got just got acquitted on those other two murders and then you had a good

700
00:42:46.441 --> 00:42:51.150
chance for an appeal. You know, you had some hope. Um,

701
00:42:51.270 --> 00:42:54.390
but I dunno who the fuck knows. I don't know what the fuck happened.

702
00:42:54.450 --> 00:42:57.480
I don't necessarily agree with that or disagree. I have no fucking idea.

703
00:42:57.780 --> 00:43:01.230
But I do know was I think if any sort of a fucking human being,

704
00:43:01.231 --> 00:43:05.550
the whole thing was just sad. It's just like, you know,

705
00:43:07.470 --> 00:43:12.370
is every just all of these lives just fucking thrown away over nothing.

706
00:43:13.450 --> 00:43:14.440
Granted, you know,

707
00:43:14.470 --> 00:43:17.350
obviously he pulled the fucking trigger and everything like that, but still,

708
00:43:17.351 --> 00:43:20.140
I don't take any sort of a, I don't know, I just, I didn't get that.

709
00:43:21.250 --> 00:43:24.680
I was just like, oh, it was just, yeah, it's one of those things you just,

710
00:43:24.850 --> 00:43:27.040
from front to back, you just wish it didn't happen. And everybody's like,

711
00:43:27.090 --> 00:43:30.220
Oh hey, here's my fucking obvious joke.

712
00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:34.780
Um, so anyway, Oh God,

713
00:43:34.781 --> 00:43:36.910
am I really going to be talking about fucking him killing himself?

714
00:43:36.911 --> 00:43:41.350
Is that how I'm going to end this podcast? How long has it podcast, Ben?

715
00:43:41.470 --> 00:43:44.620
43 minutes while you know what I'm in overtime. All right,

716
00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:47.230
let's end up on something positive tonight. Of course,

717
00:43:47.231 --> 00:43:52.231
I'm working tonight and this fucking band that I've been wanting to see,

718

728
00:44:23.690 --> 00:44:28.470
tape, uh, live on the sunset strip. So I was introduced to this band. They,

729
00:44:28.480 --> 00:44:33.090
they played this song, Harper Lewis live and, uh,

730
00:44:33.330 --> 00:44:37.650
their drummer absolutely fucking blew me away with his, um,

731
00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:41.420
just how solid his, his,

732
00:44:41.630 --> 00:44:42.770
his beats were.

733
00:44:42.771 --> 00:44:45.980
And then his use of dynamics is just on a whole other fucking level,

734
00:44:45.981 --> 00:44:48.710
which I really think is a lost art. Um,

735
00:44:48.740 --> 00:44:53.600
but they're playing tonight since 6:30 PM. And, uh,

736
00:44:53.601 --> 00:44:54.291
I wish I could go,

737
00:44:54.291 --> 00:44:58.670
but I got a fucking God damn benefit so I can't make it,

738
00:44:58.671 --> 00:45:02.060
but I'll post that clip of the band playing that song. Harper Lewis.

739
00:45:02.061 --> 00:45:05.690
It's the live version and just the way, you know,

740
00:45:05.691 --> 00:45:08.630
it just starts off with the drum beat that he's playing and he's playing it,

741
00:45:08.631 --> 00:45:13.550
you know, it gradually builds in intensity, gets louder and louder. And then,

742
00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:15.920
uh, then when they go into that, it's an instrumental band.

743
00:45:15.921 --> 00:45:18.230
I don't know how to say versus chorus. I don't know what the fuck they're doing,

744
00:45:18.231 --> 00:45:20.810
but just absolutely blew me away. If you've got nothing to do tonight,

745
00:45:20.811 --> 00:45:23.840
you want to see a killer band, go down and get a couple of tickets to that.

746
00:45:23.841 --> 00:45:27.860
I guarantee you have a great time. Um, all right, that is the podcast.

747
00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:33.200
Um, it, I guess, cause it's four 20 like weed man,

748
00:45:33.201 --> 00:45:36.290
I guess a Andrew's going to be giving you guys some extra clips.

749
00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:39.380
It's going to be a little bit longer. And uh, and that is it.

750
00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:42.170
And it was an honor to be at Charlie Murphy's memorial service.

751
00:45:42.171 --> 00:45:46.000
It was an honor to know that guy. And I want to thank, uh,

752
00:45:46.370 --> 00:45:51.170
everybody who spoke that night, last night, the way that they sent that guy off,

753
00:45:51.171 --> 00:45:52.910
it was just like, it was,

754
00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:58.540
it just was a level of greatness in the performances that I saw from the

755
00:45:58.541 --> 00:46:01.540
comedians that went up and spoke. And, um,

756
00:46:02.670 --> 00:46:04.140
Charlie was one of the greats.

757
00:46:05.210 --> 00:46:05.380
<v 1>Yeah.</v>

758
00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:06.820
<v 0>You know, and it was just,</v>

759
00:46:06.821 --> 00:46:11.470
it was such a perfect sendoff and I'm really glad that I was able to be there

760
00:46:11.471 --> 00:46:14.830
and witness it. All right. So that's it. I'll, uh, you fucking cons.

761
00:46:14.831 --> 00:46:19.240
Have a great weekend and a, enjoy this music and some, uh,

762
00:46:19.270 --> 00:46:24.270
some clips from a podcast recorded in a Monday or a Thursday gone by.
