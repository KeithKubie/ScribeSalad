Speaker 1:          00:00          You know, when you go to Russia, you take that attitude like let's just see what the experience, so you have your own experience of what Russia's, I'm going to have my own expansion. I let it be what anyone else's. And also I had been to Russia before I went in [inaudible] 95 I used to work for a company that made documentaries, these guys, and I ended up going along to help him out with, it was the first time I'd ever left. The U S is a big, uh, had a big effect on me. So I, um, do you know how to speak it? No, no, no, no. I mean, I can't, I can do my, I can do my instructions it, and I know some words. I mean, I took some time to learn how to use the alphabet so I can get around, you know what I mean?

Speaker 1:          00:32          It's crazy. Yeah. And so, you know, it's like Celtic ancient cyrillic or what it's called. Is that what it is? It's a guy named surreal. So I thought, well, how the cyrillic yet, but it's actually named after a guy who made it. That's the, the Russian stuff. What does that Celtic stuff that you know, that you know the, Oh yeah, those, those rooms. The little rooms or something? Yeah. It looks like, yeah. Yeah. The letters in Russia. Like why is it that, why would they do it backwards? Like it's the same letter that we have, but it's backwards. Right? Right. Yeah. Yeah. That's a, yeah. You're talking about, is that what it is? He has the one that looks like a backwards are. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. That's, that's what they, that's the, yeah. What does that stand for over there? Just means, yeah. Yeah.

Speaker 1:          01:10          And as you use it, like I told you that, that chaos. So that's how you say I, you said, yeah, look at their fucking language and look what's up with that age. What's up with that? Ups Ages and ages. The end. Why? But that's how you use it in. Oh my God. So like when you, so once you get used to read, so you always see pectoral pile everywhere you go. Right. What's that Lebanese restaurant? What's the upside down? Little Age. So it looks like a candle holder. Yeah. Right there. What's that? Yeah, that's an upside down h uh huh. What happened there? So we took that h and dumped it on its head but, but it looks like h doesn't it? Like if you flipped it upside down, it's WIC. The look at the e below that. Like what the fuck is that thing? And so that's a yacht that that backwards are.

Speaker 1:          01:53          Yeah. Yeah. So you would say you would use it like Ja and say that word when you use it like, and like just how we use I, oh, I and we usually like I, and then we might use it in another reason too. Yeah. Wow. Yeah. Thorough. I mean it is kind of amazing how different the way we write is to the way Asian folks do. That's right. That real freak out. That's, and I, I think you just have to learn it, right. Each one of them, you have to learn each and every one of those there. Demi, it seems, it looks like it's pretty hard to learn. Well it looks, especially if it's not completely ingrained in your memory as a child because I ended up late in life. I know there's some people who speak mandarin but they can't write it. Yeah, that's right.

Speaker 1:          02:39          And you didn't write it. Yeah. Fuck man. It's alien. Alien. I mean the fact that whole different side of the world writes that way and these little characters. So I do have some help when I go over there. I'm going to tell you something. I got married a few years ago and my wife is Russian. Ah, there you go. Yeah, and she speaks Chinese. So when I got to China reads and writes Chinese. So when we go to these countries and rights, yes. It's easier to learn. Yeah. Wow. An English or no English. Yeah. You get along. We get along because some people are good with languages. Man, that's a grubber. Spanish is better than mine are already just got here to have Russian, which has its own use of the alphabet and then Chinese, which is another whole deal. N English just does she have room in our head for anything else?

Speaker 1:          03:26          I know hard drive would be full. Yeah. That's this is those three languages. Like fuck three hard languages. Right. Probably the hardest. I heard the rushes hard and English. Well I'm not going to say hurt. I tried to allow me to try and learn it. It's hard. There's so many ways to say something cause they conjugate a lot. I think they a lot more than Spanish real. And that's what I have problems with. You know, we all get Spanish words, we live in La but conjugating verbs that you know, but she can do it easy cause she's like aw cause they conjugate so much more.

Speaker 1:          03:57          Yeah. It's, that's, this might be the three hardest language to learn outside of maybe the other one. Other Asian languages like Japanese is probably pretty difficult. I heard the Vietnamese is tough. Yeah. And then you know, you've got those languages that you look at, you know. Wow, that's great. And then you see like ancient Hebrew, you look at Hebrew language like the way they write. Like what the fuck? I don't know. I bet Arabic stuff Arabics gotta be tough. I mean, how many languages are there? If you had to guess. Yeah, a hundred days doesn't dialects and depending on like where you are. Even in Mexico there's different, yeah, speak the same Spanish down there. Even in Spanish he had like you can under like, cause you know, I took a couple of Spanish classes. Right. But I can understand people from, from, you know, uh, Spain easier for some reason I grew up right here.

Speaker 1:          04:44          It's harder for me to understand that the way they speak Spanish, my friend lives in, um, my friend Adam Green tree, he lives in Australia and uh, he has a lot of experience with like the indigenous people that live there cause he uh, works in a mining company and they, they deal with a lot of the aborigines and um, they have the groups of people they call the mobs. That's what they call themselves instead of like a village or clan or the coals off a mob. That's what, that's what aborigines shoes. And they have different languages for different moms. So like there might be hundreds of mobs in this area and they all have different languages. So you drive. I go how close? He was like a few miles. I go a few miles, you know he'd say kilometers, it might make 2000 kilometers like so you go to a hundred kilometers and you got a totally different language.

Speaker 1:          05:35          Oh that's all the different languages. Is that map of all the things that maybe they're similar, right. Areas of the moms? I don't believe so. I think they don't know what the fuck each other is saying. Right, right. That's why we can't understand Australians. Right. Cause if you look at that, that's crazy. Yeah. Like I don't know who's documenting all this stuff and what a, whether or not they've saved these languages and they, they have it. Cause it's very likely that like little ones of them will just go, you know, if this people assimilate other populations or, or move out, like you might lose these languages. Yeah. There's something I like about going to Russia to, cause there's so many different cultures and so many people and I liked it. I like people like I get that, I get the like a, I get to go to Graziani.

Speaker 1:          06:20          It'd been got to, I've been to Dagestan to Graziani is in Chechnya. Yeah. What's that like? It's really, it was a really cool place. I went to a show you some pictures, went to uh, uh, went and looked around. What, because it's, for me what's really cool about it is the energy that people have about developing over there right now. Because the place, there was a war there, you know about that, right? Yeah. There was a war and a right now and they're really building up and they're really excited about it. So I think it's just, uh, it's cool to go and see people who are really, uh, see I kind of a group of mentality about moving forward, you know? So what, where exactly is this and what was their war? You're, you've heard of Chechnya. Yeah. Yeah. So they had a war with Russia, I civil war.

Speaker 1:          07:06          So see that's what it used to look like. Yeah. Now you've got a picture of it now, right? Yeah. So it's there. Ah, there it is now rebuilding. Yeah. And there that rebuilt their, their energetic about it, and there's prior to then, and it's cool as a coach to be able to go there and get to see it. That is cool to see something in the middle of a rebirth like that. Right. It's beautiful. And in that area, a lot of places. Yeah, there's a lot of rebirth energy going on. Oh Wow. So that's what it looked like right after the war. God Damn. Wow. That's a crazy image.
