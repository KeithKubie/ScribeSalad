00:00:00.533 --> 00:00:04.500
- The two-way table of column
relative frequencies below

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:08.600
shows data on gender and voting
preferences during the 2012

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.700
United States presidential election.

00:00:10.700 --> 00:00:12.133
They give us all this data.

00:00:12.133 --> 00:00:14.300
They give us this, as they
say, the two-way table

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:16.900
of column relative frequencies.

00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.567
So for example this column
right over here is Men.

00:00:19.567 --> 00:00:23.100
The column total is 1.00, or
you could say 100 percent.

00:00:23.100 --> 00:00:27.166
And we can see that 0.42
of the Men or 42 percent

00:00:27.166 --> 00:00:29.566
of the Men voted for Obama.

00:00:29.566 --> 00:00:33.833
We can see 52% of the
Men or 0.52 of the Men

00:00:33.833 --> 00:00:36.167
voted for Romney.

00:00:36.167 --> 00:00:40.299
And we can see that the
Other, neither Obama,

00:00:40.299 --> 00:00:45.066
6 percent went for
neither Obama nor Romney.

00:00:45.066 --> 00:00:47.133
And for Women, 52 percent went for Obama,

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:48.833
43 percent went for Romney and 5 percent

00:00:48.833 --> 00:00:49.900
went for Other.

00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:53.166
And then these, this 52 plus 43 plus 5

00:00:53.166 --> 00:00:56.566
will add up to 100 percent of the women.

00:00:56.566 --> 00:00:59.066
During the 2012 United
States presidential election,

00:00:59.066 --> 00:01:01.833
were male voters more
likely to vote for Romney

00:01:01.833 --> 00:01:03.967
than female voters?

00:01:03.967 --> 00:01:05.233
So let's see.

00:01:05.233 --> 00:01:07.633
If we, there are a
couple of ways you could

00:01:07.633 --> 00:01:08.367
think about it.

00:01:08.367 --> 00:01:09.266
Well, actually, let's go this way.

00:01:09.266 --> 00:01:12.800
Male voters, if you were
a man, 52 percent of them

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.166
voted for Romney.

00:01:14.166 --> 00:01:19.166
While for the Women, 43 percent
of them voted for Romney.

00:01:19.533 --> 00:01:21.866
So a man was more likely.

00:01:21.866 --> 00:01:24.400
If you randomly picked a
man who voted, there was

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.633
a 52 percent chance they voted for Romney,

00:01:26.633 --> 00:01:28.466
while if you randomly picked a woman,

00:01:28.466 --> 00:01:30.833
there was a 43 percent,
of women who voted,

00:01:30.833 --> 00:01:33.867
there was a 43 percent chance
that she voted for Romney.

00:01:33.867 --> 00:01:37.389
So yes, male voters
were more likely to vote

00:01:37.389 --> 00:01:39.033
for Romney than female voters.

00:01:39.033 --> 00:01:40.933
So the answer is Yes.

00:01:40.933 --> 00:01:43.000
And we're done.
