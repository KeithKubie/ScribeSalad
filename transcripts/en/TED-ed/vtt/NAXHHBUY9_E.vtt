00:00:07.157 --> 00:00:10.295
Gravity. It controls the universe.

00:00:10.295 --> 00:00:12.925
Everything attracts everything else.

00:00:12.925 --> 00:00:13.590
Ouch!

00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:14.408
Including you.

00:00:14.408 --> 00:00:15.224
Ow!

00:00:15.224 --> 00:00:16.815
In this final lesson,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:19.699
we'll explore what gravity means for space-time,

00:00:19.699 --> 00:00:23.235
or rather what space-time means for gravity.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:25.332
Until now, we've been dealing with things moving

00:00:25.332 --> 00:00:27.003
at constant speeds,

00:00:27.003 --> 00:00:29.523
with straight world lines in space-time.

00:00:29.523 --> 00:00:31.395
But once you add gravity,

00:00:31.395 --> 00:00:33.300
if you measure a speed at one moment,

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:34.964
then again a bit later,

00:00:34.964 --> 00:00:37.086
the speed may have changed.

00:00:37.086 --> 00:00:39.079
In other words, as I discovered,

00:00:39.079 --> 00:00:41.949
gravity causes acceleration,

00:00:41.949 --> 00:00:43.670
so we need the world line to look different

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:45.375
from one moment to the next.

00:00:45.375 --> 00:00:46.890
As we saw in the last lesson,

00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:50.101
the correct way to tilt an object's world line

00:00:50.101 --> 00:00:52.873
is using a Lorentz transformation:

00:00:52.873 --> 00:00:55.365
Einstein's stretch and squash trick.

00:00:55.365 --> 00:00:58.132
So, to map out what gravity is doing to Tom's motion,

00:00:58.132 --> 00:01:01.149
we need to create a whole load of little patches of space-time,

00:01:01.149 --> 00:01:04.058
each transformed by different amounts.

00:01:04.058 --> 00:01:06.524
So that my world line is at a different angle in each one.

00:01:06.524 --> 00:01:10.951
And then, we're ready to stitch everything together.

00:01:10.951 --> 00:01:13.541
We assemble a cozy quilt of space-time

00:01:13.541 --> 00:01:15.942
where world lines look curved.

00:01:15.942 --> 00:01:18.940
Where the world lines join, the objects collide.

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:21.873
By making these connections between the patches,

00:01:21.873 --> 00:01:26.708
a curvature gets built into space-time itself.

00:01:26.708 --> 00:01:28.616
But Einstein's true genius

00:01:28.616 --> 00:01:31.485
was to describe precisely how each patch

00:01:31.485 --> 00:01:32.912
is stretched and squashed

00:01:32.912 --> 00:01:36.130
according to nearby mass and energy.

00:01:36.130 --> 00:01:40.424
The mere presence of stuff curves the space-time,

00:01:40.424 --> 00:01:44.472
and curving space-time moves the stuff around.

00:01:44.472 --> 00:01:47.543
This is gravity, according to Einstein.

00:01:47.543 --> 00:01:51.441
Previously, Isaac Newton had explained gravity

00:01:51.441 --> 00:01:54.504
using the ideas of force and acceleration,

00:01:54.504 --> 00:01:56.314
without any wibbily wobbly space-time,

00:01:56.314 --> 00:01:57.759
and that did pretty well.

00:01:57.759 --> 00:02:00.898
But Einstein's theory does just slightly better

00:02:00.898 --> 00:02:02.432
at predicting, for example,

00:02:02.432 --> 00:02:04.291
the orbit of Mercury around the Sun,

00:02:04.291 --> 00:02:07.591
or the way that light rays are deflected by massive objects.

00:02:07.591 --> 00:02:10.486
More importantly, Einstein's theory predicts things

00:02:10.486 --> 00:02:13.454
that simply don't exist in older theories

00:02:13.454 --> 00:02:16.526
where space, time and gravity were separate.

00:02:16.526 --> 00:02:20.871
The stitching can leave wrinkles in the space-time material.

00:02:20.871 --> 00:02:23.706
These are called gravitational waves,

00:02:23.706 --> 00:02:26.465
which should be detectable as tiny, repetitive,

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:29.029
subtle squashes and stretches in space.

00:02:29.029 --> 00:02:32.329
So we're building experiments to check if they are there.

00:02:32.329 --> 00:02:34.856
In the meantime, indirect evidence,

00:02:34.856 --> 00:02:37.383
most recently in the polarization patterns of light

00:02:37.383 --> 00:02:39.087
left over from the Big Bang,

00:02:39.087 --> 00:02:42.352
strongly suggest that they are.

00:02:42.352 --> 00:02:44.237
But despite Einstein's successes,

00:02:44.237 --> 00:02:46.574
when too much stuff gets concentrated

00:02:46.574 --> 00:02:48.018
in too small a space,

00:02:48.018 --> 00:02:50.328
like in a black hole,

00:02:50.328 --> 00:02:52.951
the curvature of space-time becomes so large,

00:02:52.951 --> 00:02:58.152
that his equations collapse.

00:02:58.152 --> 00:03:00.086
We need a new picture of space-time

00:03:00.086 --> 00:03:02.472
that incorporates quantum mechanics

00:03:02.472 --> 00:03:06.029
to unlock the secret at the heart of black holes.

00:03:06.029 --> 00:03:08.276
Which means there's plenty more to be discovered

00:03:08.276 --> 00:03:12.218
about space, time, and space-time in the future.
