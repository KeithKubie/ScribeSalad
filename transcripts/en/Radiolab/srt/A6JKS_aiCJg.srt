1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:05,830
You are listening to
radiolab radio from W N Y.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:11,140
S. C e n n. P. R. [inaudible].

3
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,030
Kind of the everyday routine. Ooh,

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,980
ever dream of a life of
romantic adventure. Yeah.

5
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,840
Wanting to get away from
it all. Yeah. We offer you

6
00:00:25,550 --> 00:00:26,383
escape

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,210
looking this way.

8
00:00:28,590 --> 00:00:31,490
Escape is, I end the free
you from the ball walls up

9
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:36,490
today or a half hour of
high adventure [inaudible].

10
00:00:37,570 --> 00:00:37,781
Okay,

11
00:00:37,781 --> 00:00:42,780
so this is an old time radio show from
the 1940s late forties I forget that

12
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:45,430
called escape and always
starts the same way. You know

13
00:00:45,590 --> 00:00:48,010
we offer you as state,

14
00:00:48,080 --> 00:00:48,950
that phrase,

15
00:00:49,370 --> 00:00:52,940
I love how they say it and here's what's
great about this show and why it seems

16
00:00:52,941 --> 00:00:54,680
like a good way to start this show.

17
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:57,680
Our show is it immediately
after they say that phrase? Yes.

18
00:00:57,830 --> 00:01:01,820
They then present you with a scenario
from which there seems to be no escape

19
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:05,400
[inaudible] hanging by your fingertips
on the sheer face of a nice cliff.

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,380
Like here's one suspended a thousand feet
above instant death with your strength

21
00:01:10,381 --> 00:01:13,620
running out and with no chance for escape.

22
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:16,473
There's a million of them.

23
00:01:16,580 --> 00:01:20,930
It's pretty, I brought a tiny chunk
on the ground off the coast of Borneo.

24
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:22,760
You were lost in the London Park.

25
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:26,800
You're a passenger for seven or eight
and you're the subject of an experiment.

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:28,360
After the age of aimless tear,

27
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:30,510
I can take the Blackman [inaudible].

28
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,260
Great. Oh wait, one more.
One more just for kicks.

29
00:01:33,950 --> 00:01:35,670
You're like, clapped
in the remote valley of

30
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:42,830
the Andrew Walden by here rock recommended
around the new clothing and you is

31
00:01:43,420 --> 00:01:46,670
the band, the blind
man to watch your eyes.

32
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:51,190
How could you not listen to that?

33
00:01:51,730 --> 00:01:54,640
What is better than like a story where
the walls are closing and nonunion?

34
00:01:54,670 --> 00:01:56,830
Don't know what you're gonna do. What
am I gonna do? What am I going to do?

35
00:01:56,831 --> 00:02:01,330
And then suddenly, or Skype, it's
like the best story ever. That's true.

36
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,360
So you're ready. Okay.

37
00:02:05,210 --> 00:02:10,210
This hour we offer you three bizarre
scenarios to stories of people and planets

38
00:02:10,820 --> 00:02:12,650
writing yearning who, Hey,

39
00:02:14,450 --> 00:02:18,320
will they make it? And if they do,

40
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,350
what are the scoping? Okay,

41
00:02:24,351 --> 00:02:29,270
enough of that. I'm Jad, I'm Robert.
This is radio lab and uh, to start,

42
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:33,470
let's talk about escape artists
because why not, right? I mean,

43
00:02:33,471 --> 00:02:34,950
this is an escape show. Exactly.

44
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:38,780
The most famous escape artists in
history is probably Harry Houdini.

45
00:02:38,960 --> 00:02:42,320
And our first story is kind of a Houdini
story. It comes from our producer pat.

46
00:02:42,350 --> 00:02:47,090
Yes. It's about a guy whose
nickname is little Houdini.

47
00:02:47,240 --> 00:02:51,060
Right? Yeah. I heard this story from my
friend Ben. Hello. Like months ago. Oh,

48
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,020
your brother Ben, your journalism
friend. My journalism trend. Yeah.

49
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
I'm a reporter with the Tampa Bay
Times in Florida, but our story begins

50
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:03,790
at the Tourney Center
penitentiary and only Tennessee.

51
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:07,090
That's where we caught up with little
Houdini. He was between escapes.

52
00:03:07,410 --> 00:03:11,050
It's a couple of guards. Walked
us into this huge cafeteria,

53
00:03:12,070 --> 00:03:15,910
sat us down at this little tiny
table and brought out Chris,

54
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:18,630
Chris Gay. That's his
name. Yeah. Do y'all have,

55
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:21,930
do you interview my brother
and everything? Yeah, we
talked to then come. Okay.

56
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,820
Sorry. Yeah, I us,

57
00:03:23,830 --> 00:03:28,830
the first thing I noticed was he was
even smaller than I expected him to be.

58
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,830
He's going to be a little,
you know, nickname, but uh,

59
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,670
he was a very little Houdini short
little maybe five. Five, yeah. One 41 30.

60
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:40,000
His prison uniform was,
was pretty baggy on him.

61
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:42,700
He was wearing a white ball cap and uh,

62
00:03:43,030 --> 00:03:44,860
he's got a big smile
stretched across his face.

63
00:03:45,530 --> 00:03:49,610
Skype. I think it's, it's actually
addicted, I think. Addicted. Yeah.

64
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:53,280
I think it is, but I think
what's addictive about it, it's,

65
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,200
it's a way to, uh, it's a way to
punch him in the stomach. Say, Hey,

66
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:01,170
this can be done. I can do
this. I might not have been new.

67
00:04:01,171 --> 00:04:03,540
Y'All might have told me I can't
do nothing on my life. More people.

68
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,340
I've told me that I know I can do it.

69
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:08,810
How many times have you escaped?

70
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:13,230
Probably about 13,

71
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:17,310
13, 13. 13 out of jail. Yeah.

72
00:04:17,370 --> 00:04:19,860
And unfortunate to Arthur
King. I made all 13.

73
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:23,820
I did a little research to see how that
compares to other Houdini's and there

74
00:04:23,821 --> 00:04:26,670
are a few people who come close
as far as I was able to find out.

75
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:29,160
Nobody alive has that many escapes.

76
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:34,290
Can we say pretty safely that he's
the greatest jailbreaker alive.

77
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:37,200
I'll go ahead and call them that. Yeah.

78
00:04:37,920 --> 00:04:40,890
So I got away from month pretty
much without even asking.

79
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:45,570
Chris began to list his escape. He
has escaped every way you can imagine.

80
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:48,080
Slip my hand, clip out.
What the dire does,

81
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:50,680
what out the band in
between the [inaudible].

82
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:54,480
All my clothes upset my
boxer shorts like handcuffs.

83
00:04:54,810 --> 00:04:58,020
He said picking a handcuff keys. One
of the easiest things he's ever done.

84
00:04:58,021 --> 00:05:01,930
Sure enough, he's used everything from
a pen spring to a safety pen. Yeah.

85
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:04,560
Even once the zipper thing
might Hank hippy out.

86
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,390
My zipper scrambled out windows, ran out
doors, climbed over walls under walls,

87
00:05:09,391 --> 00:05:12,090
drilled through them. State suicide twice.

88
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:15,270
Trick the cops by drawing
up fake escape plans.

89
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:18,660
Food their dogs by covering his
clothes and pepper a pepper.

90
00:05:19,320 --> 00:05:22,560
Another time he didn't have any
pepper, but he found some roadkill.

91
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:27,070
They didn't smell like a scout and he
rubs it all over his body to a racist

92
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:29,520
scent. Pretty good at hiding
it too. He's hitting the trees,

93
00:05:29,820 --> 00:05:31,950
jumped down at trap door that
he cut the floor of his trailer.

94
00:05:31,980 --> 00:05:36,180
Once he hit a grave, I'll have the
shallow grade beside a dead body.

95
00:05:36,310 --> 00:05:36,931
Another time.

96
00:05:36,931 --> 00:05:41,340
He ended up in a college campus someplace
outside Atlanta and he hit out on top

97
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:42,900
of an air duct for two days

98
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:46,560
until the coast is clear.

99
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:50,010
But one of the interesting things about
Chris is that even though he's been

100
00:05:50,011 --> 00:05:53,940
doing this for 20 years, there's never
a record of him assaulting anyone. No,

101
00:05:55,430 --> 00:05:57,060
I'll refuse to do it. Stole things.

102
00:05:57,200 --> 00:06:00,980
Pretty much only things to help him run
are always refused to go in somebody's

103
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:03,560
house hours, refuse to
go in somebody's garage.

104
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,050
He says you got rules from sales
about how he breaks the law.

105
00:06:06,170 --> 00:06:08,030
Almost like a coat. In fact,

106
00:06:08,031 --> 00:06:11,660
the story that got Ben Interested in
Chris in the first place is kind of the

107
00:06:11,661 --> 00:06:12,800
perfect example of this.

108
00:06:12,850 --> 00:06:17,110
This was a few years ago in 2007 and
got a press release from the Florida

109
00:06:17,111 --> 00:06:20,380
highway patrol. Be on the
lookout for, you know, Chris Gay,

110
00:06:20,940 --> 00:06:23,290
and according to the press
release, here's what happened.

111
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,530
Chris had been locked up in Alabama
when he got a telephone call from his

112
00:06:26,531 --> 00:06:30,190
family. He said, my mom was
a was guy. She had cancer,

113
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:32,500
so he faked suicide,

114
00:06:32,530 --> 00:06:35,650
busted out of the prison transport van
that was bringing him to the hospital,

115
00:06:35,651 --> 00:06:38,260
stole a truck, and just
started driving home.

116
00:06:38,261 --> 00:06:42,350
Who's going to see his mom to pay his
last respects and expect her to live there

117
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:45,190
alone as he comes around the bend
in the road to where his mom lives.

118
00:06:45,191 --> 00:06:49,240
He's driving a Walmart tractor trailer
and he's got like a dozen cops on his

119
00:06:49,241 --> 00:06:50,680
tail. When I get Dan are run by,

120
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:54,100
I run off the road crashes truck
into a field near his mom's trailer.

121
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,590
Jumps out of the truck. Yes it was.
That was wrong. Told House. They start,

122
00:06:56,770 --> 00:06:57,790
they've jumped out of
the cars and running.

123
00:06:58,030 --> 00:06:59,530
Told them and just before
he makes it inside,

124
00:06:59,590 --> 00:07:01,870
they chase him into the
woods and he disappears

125
00:07:03,030 --> 00:07:07,050
without seeing his mom who would end
up dying before he could see her.

126
00:07:09,040 --> 00:07:09,873
Few days later,

127
00:07:11,010 --> 00:07:15,840
Chris turns up in Daytona beach driving
a tour bus that belonged to crystal.

128
00:07:16,270 --> 00:07:19,860
Gale beat the country's thing ever. Yeah,

129
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:24,690
he's still crystal Gail's tour bus in
Tennessee and then drove it to Florida.

130
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,490
Yeah. So you get this press release
in and you think what? I thought, uh,

131
00:07:28,860 --> 00:07:30,660
how do you miss with a story like this?

132
00:07:30,870 --> 00:07:33,420
And so Ben writes a story
for the newspaper, Big News,

133
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,450
and pretty soon actually tour bus that
normally carries TV news people on it

134
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:42,660
took off. He's an escape artist
and something of a folk hero.

135
00:07:42,900 --> 00:07:45,510
And soon crispy came
something of a folk song.

136
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:49,560
Literally the week Chris got caught at
Grammy Award winning bluegrass picker

137
00:07:49,561 --> 00:07:54,150
named Tim O'Brien put out a song
called the Dalat of Christopher Daniel.

138
00:07:56,120 --> 00:07:56,190
Daniel Gay,

139
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,220
pretty soon of famous Hollywood
director bought the rights to the movie.

140
00:07:59,430 --> 00:08:02,540
They were originally trying to
get Johnny yet to do it. But

141
00:08:08,060 --> 00:08:12,090
it's perfect. You're the
underdog making a run for it,

142
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,200
for what seemed to dance. I'm
going to be really good intentions.

143
00:08:17,910 --> 00:08:21,660
And part of me thought, you know, I
mean this is awesome, but it's also,

144
00:08:22,300 --> 00:08:23,010
I mean there's gotta be

145
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:26,160
more to this story. Absolutely.

146
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:30,960
Who's this guy really and
why does he keep running

147
00:08:32,250 --> 00:08:34,650
destination? You want to
tell us where we're going.

148
00:08:34,830 --> 00:08:39,830
Going to Buckeye bottom
road to talk to tare gay.

149
00:08:40,680 --> 00:08:42,360
A Tory is Chris, his older brother.

150
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:45,330
He says he can tell us that whole
story about how they grew up.

151
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:48,033
Here we are.

152
00:08:49,050 --> 00:08:52,490
Chris grew up in a small trailer out in
the middle of nowhere West Nashville.

153
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:56,040
There are junk cars off

154
00:08:56,040 --> 00:08:58,020
in the woods. Uh, when you,

155
00:08:58,260 --> 00:09:01,010
if I entirely hanging out with a
couple buddies drinking two beers,

156
00:09:01,150 --> 00:09:03,510
I'll have any certain things you
want to know about or anything.

157
00:09:03,511 --> 00:09:06,300
Or when we start talking about what
it was like when they were kids.

158
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:07,950
Now we lived in a little
bitty trailer down there.

159
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,590
He points off into the woods across the
street on this land. It was Kristin,

160
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,720
Tyree, mom and dad and a little
brother named Eddie who went by cotton.

161
00:09:15,960 --> 00:09:17,640
And then there was Leanne lane gay,

162
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:20,520
the eldest among his older
sister cottons in jail.

163
00:09:20,521 --> 00:09:21,840
So we weren't able to interview him,

164
00:09:21,841 --> 00:09:25,170
but Leanne and Terry both told us that
growing up in that trailer was hard.

165
00:09:25,380 --> 00:09:29,670
We grew up like mountain paving
walkie, no, no electricity,

166
00:09:29,671 --> 00:09:33,420
no running water. Did their wash in the
river wasn't only as much food around.

167
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:37,290
I used to be a big field of plums.

168
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,970
A big plum thicket would go down and
woody, but you can't live on plums.

169
00:09:41,971 --> 00:09:46,680
And a lot of days we would be hungry.
Leanne remembers they're lying in bed.

170
00:09:46,690 --> 00:09:50,010
One on nine. She couldn't go to sleep
because her hunger pangs were so bad.

171
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:53,040
And Tare said, here, this'll help Ya.

172
00:09:53,190 --> 00:09:57,570
And he ripped up and little dyeing a
notebook paper gave it to Leann. He said,

173
00:09:57,571 --> 00:10:00,040
just chew it up real good and
swallow it and it'll help. Yeah.

174
00:10:00,270 --> 00:10:04,200
And for Chris and his little brother
at cotton, those were the good days.

175
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:07,730
[inaudible]

176
00:10:07,730 --> 00:10:10,730
because when my daddy and her separated,

177
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:13,460
mom and dad got a divorce and
the family split apart. Tardy.

178
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:16,160
Leanne went to live with mom,
Chris and his little brother Eddie,

179
00:10:16,190 --> 00:10:21,110
who are 10 and 11 at that point moved
in with their dad and the dad, dad,

180
00:10:21,111 --> 00:10:25,760
he really wasn't, you know, I don't
guess he just didn't know provider.

181
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:28,190
He wasn't around very much. Oh, I mean,

182
00:10:28,220 --> 00:10:30,890
he was a deadbeat dad.

183
00:10:31,240 --> 00:10:33,160
Yeah, he, he got where he, um,

184
00:10:33,520 --> 00:10:36,670
he would get off work on Fridays and he
wouldn't come home for weeks at a time.

185
00:10:37,100 --> 00:10:41,080
He'd tell him to go if they was
hungry to go steal from churches.

186
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:43,990
Sometimes they'd hike through the
woods into their grandfather's house.

187
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,140
Their Mom's dad, who Chris says hated
him and his little brother cotton.

188
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:48,340
We would go down there and he would,

189
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,640
he got where he started making us
fight each other. And we could,

190
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:56,560
if we first fought each other in the
winter, got some deep. It's, you know, he,

191
00:10:56,561 --> 00:11:00,700
he was me. Maybe it was, that was their
life beating each other up for food.

192
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:02,500
He had go. He took his dogs on us.

193
00:11:03,420 --> 00:11:07,780
So one night, one of them went and
found their dad's rifle, an old 22

194
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:12,520
and a tube sock full of rusty
bullets and went out behind the barn,

195
00:11:13,550 --> 00:11:18,400
uh, lit a tire fire and,
uh, made a suicide pact.

196
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:20,900
[inaudible]

197
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:24,710
cotton was going to shoot Chris in
the forehead and then shoot himself.

198
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:29,300
And Chris closed his eyes and cotton
put the gun to Chris's forehead.

199
00:11:30,470 --> 00:11:34,850
Chris heard him whimper and he opened
his eyes and concept, I can't do it.

200
00:11:36,140 --> 00:11:38,390
And Chris said, well, let
me, let me, let me do it.

201
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:43,450
He took the gun and he put the barrel to
his brother's head and he couldn't pull

202
00:11:43,571 --> 00:11:44,404
the trigger either.

203
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,040
And they were 10 and 11 at this
point. 10 and 11 man. And Ben says,

204
00:11:50,041 --> 00:11:51,120
if you take a step back,

205
00:11:51,121 --> 00:11:55,680
you can see that it's right about here
at this point that Kristen has brothers

206
00:11:55,930 --> 00:11:59,230
start to steal, like really
steal. And I started that,

207
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,000
likes it on bicycles and
then he went to a little,

208
00:12:01,001 --> 00:12:03,790
I guess four wheelers and
motorcycles is all stuff with wheels.

209
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,193
Yeah.

210
00:12:05,530 --> 00:12:10,290
Chris remembers going with
cotton to sit on a bluff. Yeah,

211
00:12:10,380 --> 00:12:11,350
it was on interstate 40.

212
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:17,130
We would go a wash trucks of ice and
they would dream about getting an a in a

213
00:12:17,901 --> 00:12:22,710
semi and driving [inaudible]. Then
they went to a, I guess forwarders,

214
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:24,400
motorcycles and cars.

215
00:12:24,401 --> 00:12:28,450
And it gradually got bigger and bigger
and bigger to one day. When Chris was 17,

216
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:30,130
he stole a a

217
00:12:30,310 --> 00:12:33,060
semi, didn't even really know
how to drive it. But, um,

218
00:12:33,480 --> 00:12:35,070
I kind of decided the keys was in it,

219
00:12:36,270 --> 00:12:40,800
so I started it up from there.
There's really no looking back.

220
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:43,040
Can I pause you right
there before you continue?

221
00:12:43,041 --> 00:12:47,150
Let me just name some modes of
transportation and you tell me yes or no.

222
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:51,470
What you've stolen a semi bulldozer. Yes.

223
00:12:51,530 --> 00:12:55,500
Skid steer, skid steer, tractor back coat,

224
00:12:56,120 --> 00:12:59,770
anything that's that flies. I actually
got in a helicopter once and uh,

225
00:12:59,810 --> 00:13:02,050
we got in there, started flipping
switches and we finally got it.

226
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,860
We got the blight would rotate,

227
00:13:03,861 --> 00:13:07,340
but it was a little low low thing
and got scared and got out of it.

228
00:13:07,970 --> 00:13:12,050
Point is this is his life for more than
two decades. Even things that move,

229
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:14,690
getting caught in, escaping,
stealing things that move,

230
00:13:14,691 --> 00:13:18,710
getting caught and escaping until
eventually he became bat guy on TV.

231
00:13:19,510 --> 00:13:23,120
Dany who had police on
the run and six states.

232
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:25,320
But then when they,

233
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:30,080
something happened that seemed like
it might break this loop forever.

234
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,790
He met a girl. Yes.
Yes. Her name was missy.

235
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,760
She was waiting tables at
a little campsite diner.

236
00:13:38,180 --> 00:13:42,260
He thought she was cute and Missy, he's
a smooth talker. I'll give him that.

237
00:13:44,210 --> 00:13:46,880
She liked the way he taught,
taken right off the bat.

238
00:13:46,881 --> 00:13:51,881
And a few months later I got pregnant
with my daughter and me and him moved in

239
00:13:52,431 --> 00:13:54,950
together and for a while
life was really [inaudible].

240
00:13:55,380 --> 00:13:58,390
We still had a little money in the
bank and I was working good for Gregory

241
00:13:58,440 --> 00:14:02,030
instruction, had a good paying job,
running it up bulldozer. And uh,

242
00:14:02,290 --> 00:14:04,740
I was actually going to school
in Lebanon to get my CDL license.

243
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:09,330
We had a nice trailer and
it had a refrigerator.

244
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,360
Did you like it? Yeah, I really, I
really liked [inaudible]. Matter of fact,

245
00:14:12,361 --> 00:14:16,260
I was talking to my daughter last night.
It came real close with my daughter.

246
00:14:16,290 --> 00:14:20,490
She remembers it like it was
yesterday. He got her a dog.

247
00:14:20,820 --> 00:14:24,300
She named him blackjack first
puppy. She ever got that right.

248
00:14:24,301 --> 00:14:28,290
There was the best moments in
days of a diapers, days a month,

249
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:30,390
I think for mine in his life I ever,

250
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:38,530
but then things got complicated.

251
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:41,890
The one day when Chris and missy
were driving in the car together,

252
00:14:41,950 --> 00:14:44,890
we were going right through in the
middle of Nashville and, uh, Chris says,

253
00:14:44,891 --> 00:14:46,540
look, I gotta tell you something.

254
00:14:47,590 --> 00:14:52,000
I stole something cause I stole
the bobcat tractor from my

255
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:54,250
construction job and to make ends meet

256
00:14:56,070 --> 00:14:59,120
as soon as she heard that missy
whipped her head around. And um,

257
00:14:59,300 --> 00:15:02,100
I like hitting with a big Mac right in
the middle of Nashville and I just wanted

258
00:15:04,180 --> 00:15:07,030
a big man. Yes, Auntie ed.

259
00:15:08,080 --> 00:15:09,480
There was only funny for a little while,

260
00:15:09,670 --> 00:15:12,960
a couple of days later somebody
told on me, I've got arrested.

261
00:15:13,070 --> 00:15:16,590
He stayed in jail for about
two years and then escaped.

262
00:15:16,680 --> 00:15:17,700
I don't know how exactly,

263
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:21,960
but before long he still again
and ended up back in jail again.

264
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:26,440
And um, and missy had stayed
by his side again. She,

265
00:15:26,630 --> 00:15:30,010
she was determined he'd come home
from these escapes saying, Oh,

266
00:15:30,030 --> 00:15:31,200
just tell you to being locked up.

267
00:15:31,370 --> 00:15:33,780
He did being away from you guys
won't be a boy for my kids.

268
00:15:33,781 --> 00:15:36,360
And I didn't want to be away from
me. [inaudible] got locked up.

269
00:15:36,361 --> 00:15:37,860
Missy would write him letters.

270
00:15:37,950 --> 00:15:42,240
I would send him money cause I work the
whole time I was pregnant with my uh,

271
00:15:42,270 --> 00:15:44,700
13 year old. What kind
of work were you doing?

272
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:47,940
Worked on a sand and line
standard rocking chairs.

273
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,590
Chris meanwhile was thinking about his
next escape and when he came charging

274
00:15:52,591 --> 00:15:54,690
through the front door,
thinking of roadkill,

275
00:15:54,691 --> 00:15:58,770
telling missy the again he had
escaped. I stayed with him again.

276
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:04,900
But this time you guys started asking
for check stubs on a weekly basis and add

277
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:07,540
an hours up that he had been
gone from time he left the house,

278
00:16:07,541 --> 00:16:12,490
which I would knock down riding time there
in from you were keeping tabs on him?

279
00:16:12,580 --> 00:16:13,413
Yes I was.

280
00:16:13,450 --> 00:16:16,960
She even went so far as to take $5,000
out of the bank account that they shared

281
00:16:17,020 --> 00:16:19,990
by a trailer for them to live in
one that wouldn't move. You know,

282
00:16:19,991 --> 00:16:22,930
I was trying try and more or
less to make him do. Right.

283
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:24,760
And it seemed like it was working.

284
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:29,350
But then one night Chris came in after
work and sat down in the living room with

285
00:16:29,351 --> 00:16:32,950
missy and their daughter to watch
some TV next. I know we heard loud,

286
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:35,120
beaten at the door. Well, you know,

287
00:16:35,121 --> 00:16:40,010
I jump up and he jumps up and
um, uh, next thing I know he was,

288
00:16:40,100 --> 00:16:44,870
you know, moving that kitchen table
and sliding it out. Next thing I know,

289
00:16:44,871 --> 00:16:48,290
he raises the rug up off the floor and
he jumps down in there and he says,

290
00:16:48,291 --> 00:16:52,820
cover it back up. So I cover it back up,
put the table back and answer the door.

291
00:16:53,450 --> 00:16:58,190
And uh, they came in and they
walked all around the house and uh,

292
00:17:00,040 --> 00:17:00,873
and they laughed.

293
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:06,110
He bought this house to keep him still
and he'd cut a trap door in it. Yep.

294
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,990
He just stayed up on his father the
whole time they were walking over top of

295
00:17:08,991 --> 00:17:12,980
him. Wow. Yeah. I guess it
was more or less I was young,

296
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:15,830
I knowed but I was also in denial.

297
00:17:16,070 --> 00:17:19,310
But eventually something happened that
kind of forced her to admit just how bad

298
00:17:19,311 --> 00:17:21,680
things had gotten with
Chris day before Halloween.

299
00:17:22,630 --> 00:17:25,790
[inaudible] owner daddy had went down to
Walmart and she had picked out a little

300
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:29,420
which outfit, but she was old enough
and they don't, you know, she was for,

301
00:17:29,900 --> 00:17:32,780
you know, trickle trading for a
four year old. That was a big thing.

302
00:17:33,020 --> 00:17:36,200
The next morning it's Halloween. Her
daddy looked at her and said, what baby?

303
00:17:36,201 --> 00:17:40,870
I'm going to work. Um, I'll
say this afternoon, you know,

304
00:17:40,940 --> 00:17:41,773
I'll get home,

305
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:45,110
we'll get you out outfit on you and we'll
go trick or treating up in Nashville.

306
00:17:46,070 --> 00:17:47,030
And that afternoon,

307
00:17:47,300 --> 00:17:50,100
Danielle was sitting on the back step and
then was just sitting there in a white

308
00:17:50,101 --> 00:17:53,530
tee shirt. And I asked her, I said,
Daniel, what are you doing? How about no,

309
00:17:53,531 --> 00:17:55,320
my daddy get home mama? He says,

310
00:17:55,321 --> 00:17:59,010
we're going to go Nashville and we're
going to go trick or treating. I said,

311
00:17:59,011 --> 00:18:02,820
okay, he'll be back in a little bit.
And she sat there and she sat there

312
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:09,010
and he never came home that night.

313
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:16,740
You, um, I don't really hear, like,

314
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:22,410
I don't hear a lot of bitterness
from, you know, is that accurate?

315
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,890
Yes. Why? What?

316
00:18:25,891 --> 00:18:29,850
As far as me being upset with
Chris or Hating Chris? Yes ma'am.

317
00:18:29,851 --> 00:18:31,590
Is that what you're asking me? Yes ma'am.

318
00:18:32,970 --> 00:18:36,810
How could you not forgive Chris? 18 years.

319
00:18:37,530 --> 00:18:42,530
That's how long I've known that boy and
I have seen firsthand where he lived,

320
00:18:43,470 --> 00:18:44,340
how he lived.

321
00:18:47,070 --> 00:18:50,640
I'm a fighter and I go to
church, my kids go to church.

322
00:18:51,270 --> 00:18:54,690
I learned to forgive people
and Chris was, had a hard life.

323
00:18:55,770 --> 00:18:58,800
He needs help. Help
that our can't give him

324
00:19:06,040 --> 00:19:06,150
[inaudible]

325
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:09,090
you saw it for a while that you could
give him that help and yes it is.

326
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,060
[inaudible]

327
00:19:15,060 --> 00:19:16,770
I should have been
there for my kids. Yeah,

328
00:19:17,260 --> 00:19:19,640
they took a lot of time on
making this up. Yeah, no, Mike,

329
00:19:19,810 --> 00:19:20,790
you know what are done

330
00:19:22,240 --> 00:19:23,030
[inaudible]

331
00:19:23,030 --> 00:19:25,610
so what do you make of
this story, Pat? Well,

332
00:19:26,420 --> 00:19:28,180
somewhere along the way
for Ben and I, this,

333
00:19:28,630 --> 00:19:32,030
this story really became
about the symbol question.

334
00:19:32,700 --> 00:19:35,990
Can a person like Chris, you
know, grew up the way he did?

335
00:19:37,800 --> 00:19:39,270
Can a person like that change

336
00:19:41,100 --> 00:19:43,260
or do you just never escape
a childhood like that?

337
00:19:43,590 --> 00:19:47,030
People live with a how
they grew up. Yes. Miss.

338
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:51,840
She says if two kids and a wife
that he loves, if we keep stopping,

339
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:55,870
I don't know what Cam, but when we
asked Chris, he said, it's in my mind.

340
00:19:55,970 --> 00:19:59,280
I'd only change it on our own. They're
going to change. I'm working to change.

341
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,220
Really? Of course he has
said that before. Truthfully,

342
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:04,310
what's different this
time? What? What? You know?

343
00:20:04,550 --> 00:20:08,220
I'm going places I don't have to
take, I've taken every one of them.

344
00:20:08,790 --> 00:20:11,400
I'm taking her anger. I'm
taking how to be a better daddy.

345
00:20:11,850 --> 00:20:16,430
I'm taking everything about, if I were
not a pro this month, I'm going to,

346
00:20:16,431 --> 00:20:20,830
I asked him, can I go ahead and
complete another non-math problem? Wait,

347
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,330
is he saying he's going to ask
them to keep him in jail? Yeah.

348
00:20:24,700 --> 00:20:28,080
It's 20 years of running. He's asking
the parole board not to let him go,

349
00:20:28,140 --> 00:20:31,710
which made me think, I don't know.
Maybe. And Ben, what do you think?

350
00:20:32,770 --> 00:20:34,360
I don't think there's any way

351
00:20:37,340 --> 00:20:40,580
that Chris changes. I
think he's, you know,

352
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:45,260
unfortunately doomed to stay
in the cycle, which sucks.

353
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:50,260
You know? I'm sort of ashamed
that I have opinion. Why?

354
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,470
I mean, why do you think
you feel that way? I,

355
00:20:55,140 --> 00:20:59,380
I mean my dad was pretty
similar to Chris in many ways.

356
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:04,240
Really. My father abandoned
me, uh, when I was,

357
00:21:04,300 --> 00:21:07,480
when I was a young boy. And, um,

358
00:21:08,080 --> 00:21:12,520
and I got reacquainted with him when
I was a teenager. At that point.

359
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:16,780
He was, um, a very sad alcoholic,

360
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:17,620
uh,

361
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:22,620
who often made big mistakes and
I played high school football.

362
00:21:24,190 --> 00:21:27,880
And near the end of the, of
the year, my senior year,

363
00:21:27,881 --> 00:21:29,470
they put out this highlight tape.

364
00:21:30,280 --> 00:21:33,820
So I took that highlight tape to
his trailer in Slick Oklahoma.

365
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:37,840
And after shooting a lot of Tequila,

366
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:42,130
we sat down on the couch together and
I put the tape in and we were watching,

367
00:21:42,760 --> 00:21:45,790
you know, watching me
play football. And, um,

368
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:50,500
not long into it. My Dad
starts sobbing, just bawling,

369
00:21:50,510 --> 00:21:54,730
tears running down his face. And I
look over at him and, uh, and he says,

370
00:21:56,080 --> 00:21:58,630
I wish I could have been there. And

371
00:22:00,300 --> 00:22:05,300
I wanted nothing more in that
moment and today than to ask him,

372
00:22:06,810 --> 00:22:11,020
why weren't you? And, um,

373
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:13,180
I think in some way

374
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:20,080
I get that opportunity in this
job to ask my dad that question.

375
00:22:21,810 --> 00:22:24,180
Ben Says, his dad never
answered that question.

376
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:28,320
And after that day where they watched
that football tape, nothing changed.

377
00:22:28,650 --> 00:22:31,320
Ben got Older, you graduated
from college, got married,

378
00:22:31,321 --> 00:22:34,110
had kids and his dad never
showed up for any of it.

379
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:39,340
So he says when he's talking to a guy
like Chris, in some ways I, I, you know,

380
00:22:39,430 --> 00:22:42,700
I'm sitting across the
table from my own father,

381
00:22:43,090 --> 00:22:44,410
which doesn't give him a lot of hope.

382
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:49,440
The only ounce of encouragement that I
have honestly is if we find out that,

383
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:54,430
that Chris has indeed when given
the chance to get out of jail,

384
00:22:54,490 --> 00:22:58,750
said, no thank you. Maybe that
gives me an ounce of hope.

385
00:23:01,140 --> 00:23:05,250
And a couple of weeks ago,
Ben got a letter from Chris.

386
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:10,390
Can you just say, can
you read it for me? Yeah.

387
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:18,100
Uh, he says, dear Mr. Montgomery,
thank you for your letter.

388
00:23:18,430 --> 00:23:19,510
I'm doing well.

389
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:25,840
I went up for parole and yes, I did ask
them to let me go through the program.

390
00:23:27,190 --> 00:23:30,400
The final decision was to parole
me upon completion of the program,

391
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,560
listening to radio lab, radio,W , n, y, s,

392
00:23:37,180 --> 00:23:40,400
e, n, p, r,

393
00:23:42,690 --> 00:23:46,070
double e, every day routine. Woo. Ever

394
00:23:46,220 --> 00:23:50,330
dream of a life of
romantic adventure. Yeah.

395
00:23:50,820 --> 00:23:53,060
Wanting to get away from it all. Yeah.

396
00:23:53,160 --> 00:23:55,870
We offer you escape.

397
00:23:57,510 --> 00:23:58,560
Is this this way?

398
00:23:58,990 --> 00:24:02,390
Escape the sign the
[inaudible] walls up today,

399
00:24:02,780 --> 00:24:06,750
or a half hour of high
adventure. [inaudible]

400
00:24:07,940 --> 00:24:08,151
okay,

401
00:24:08,151 --> 00:24:13,151
so this is an old time radio show from
the 1940s late forties I forget that.

402
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,820
Called escape and always
starts the same way. You know,

403
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:18,760
we offer, you escape that

404
00:24:18,760 --> 00:24:19,593
phrase,

405
00:24:19,750 --> 00:24:23,320
I love how they say it and here's what's
great about this show and why it seems

406
00:24:23,321 --> 00:24:26,020
like a good way to start
this show. Our show is it.
