ANDREW HOH: Airbnb's
an online marketplace.

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:07.680
We have over 5 million
different homes

00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:11.190
in 81,000 cities, which
equates to hundreds of millions

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.990
of photos, making it
possibly the largest

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:16.950
collection of images of
homes in the world today.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:18.990
When a guest decides
to select a home,

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:21.390
one of the biggest
influences in their decision

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.000
is a diverse set of images.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.830
But a lot of times,
hosts will take

00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.340
a lot of pictures
of a single room

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.190
and forget to take pictures
of the other rooms.

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:32.710
SHIJING YAO: They also have
the option to add captions,

00:00:32.710 --> 00:00:34.710
but a lot of the cases,
they're totally off.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:36.412
ANDREW HOH: No.

00:00:36.412 --> 00:00:38.370
ALFREDO LUQUE: We were
faced with the challenge

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:41.610
of identifying what's
actually in these pictures

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:44.340
and present them
properly on the site.

00:00:44.340 --> 00:00:47.190
That's one area where
machine learning excels.

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:49.020
The real challenge
was one of scale.

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.330
We had upwards of half a
billion images to get through.

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:55.038
It was going to take months to
really go through all of these.

00:00:55.038 --> 00:00:56.580
ANDREW HOH: Using
TensorFlow, we were

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:59.030
able to speed up the
process and deliver

00:00:59.030 --> 00:01:00.945
a reasonable model within days.

00:01:00.945 --> 00:01:04.690
Bighead is Airbnb's
machine learning platform.

00:01:04.690 --> 00:01:07.740
We had the idea of making it
very agnostic to different ML

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.340
frameworks, and so we levered
TensorFlow to train the model.

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:14.130
And then Bighead helps with the
model lifecycle, the feature

00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:16.260
management, and then
TensorFlow Serving

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:18.022
to help serve the model results.

00:01:18.022 --> 00:01:19.480
SHIJING YAO: Before
you're thinking

00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:21.397
about which tool to use,
you're first thinking

00:01:21.397 --> 00:01:22.500
about which model to use.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.830
And we did research on this.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:26.270
We find that ResNet 50 was
one of the state-of-the-art

00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:27.570
performing models.

00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:30.530
We used that as the
basic architecture.

00:01:30.530 --> 00:01:33.120
ALFREDO LUQUE: We used
TensorFlow's cross APIs

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.730
and serving and some of the
distributed GPU computations.

00:01:38.730 --> 00:01:41.178
This ultimately
led to a pipeline

00:01:41.178 --> 00:01:43.470
that we could deploy to go
through hundreds of millions

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:45.460
of images very quickly.

00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:47.370
ANDREW HOH: So the
end goal is basically

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.710
using these
classifications of images

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.050
to make sure that their
first, initial set of photos

00:01:52.050 --> 00:01:54.092
that they see aren't just
a picture of the garage

00:01:54.092 --> 00:01:54.735
and bathroom.

00:01:54.735 --> 00:01:56.860
But it could be of the
living room that's gorgeous,

00:01:56.860 --> 00:01:59.310
and the bedroom, and
the swimming pool.

00:01:59.310 --> 00:02:02.820
Future applications could be
to detect different objects

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:03.330
in homes.

00:02:03.330 --> 00:02:05.610
And if users decide to
search on the website

00:02:05.610 --> 00:02:08.400
for specific amenity types,
we can actually bubble that up

00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.110
to the surface.

00:02:10.110 --> 00:02:12.340
SHIJING YAO: If you like
how Airbnb operates today,

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:13.320
the reason was
because of machine

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.570
learning because machine
learning is almost everywhere

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:16.230
in the company.

00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.745
Search ranking, pricing,
predictive booking.

00:02:18.745 --> 00:02:21.120
ALFREDO LUQUE: We're passing
into the hundreds of models,

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:24.055
so it's something I
expect to keep growing.

00:02:24.055 --> 00:02:26.430
ANDREW HOH: And with a lot of
these new frameworks coming

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:28.470
out, we can make
better experiences

00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.130
for our guests and better
business decisions, as well.

00:02:32.130 --> 00:02:34.580
