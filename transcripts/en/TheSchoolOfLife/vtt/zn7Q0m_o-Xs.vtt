00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:05.910
No one intends for this to happen, of course,
but somewhere in our childhood, our trajectory

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:12.610
towards emotional maturity will almost certainly
be impeded. Even if we are sensitively cared

00:00:12.610 --> 00:00:18.510
for and lovingly handled, we can be counted
upon not to pass through our young years without

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:26.850
sustaining some kind of deep psychological
injury – what we can term a Primal Wound.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.210
Childhood opens us up to emotional damage
in part because, unlike all other living things,

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:38.910
homo sapiens has an inordinately long and
structurally claustrophobic pupillage. A foal

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.360
is standing up thirty minutes after it is
born. A human will, by the age of eighteen,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.930
have spent around 25,000 hours in the company
of its parents. A female grouper mother will

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:56.629
unsentimentally dump up to 100 million eggs
a year in the sandy banks off the north Atlantic

00:00:56.629 --> 00:01:01.910
seaboard and never see a single one of her
off-spring again. Even the blue whale, the

00:01:01.910 --> 00:01:07.100
largest animal on the planet, is sexually
mature and independent by the age of five.

00:01:07.100 --> 00:01:13.319
But for our part, we dither and linger; it
can be a year till we take our first steps

00:01:13.319 --> 00:01:18.259
and two before we can speak in a whole sentence.
It is close to two decades before we are categorised

00:01:18.259 --> 00:01:24.459
as adults. And in the meantime, we are at
the mercy of that highly peculiar and distorting

00:01:24.459 --> 00:01:31.820
institution we call home, and its even more
distinctive overseers, our parents. Across

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:36.070
the long summers and winters of childhood,
we are intimately shaped by the ways of the

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:40.880
big people around us: we come to know their
favourite expressions, their habits, how they

00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:45.789
respond when they are late, the way they address
us when they’re cross. We know the atmosphere

00:01:45.789 --> 00:01:51.479
of home on a bright July morning and in the
afternoon downpours of mid-April. We memorise

00:01:51.479 --> 00:01:55.939
the textures of the carpets and the smells
of the clothes’ cupboards. In middle-age,

00:01:55.939 --> 00:02:01.029
we can still recall the taste of a particular
biscuit we liked after school and know intimately

00:02:01.029 --> 00:02:07.399
the tiny sounds a parent makes as they concentrate
on an article in the newspaper. During our

00:02:07.399 --> 00:02:13.319
elongated gestation, we are at first, in a
physical sense, completely at the mercy of

00:02:13.319 --> 00:02:18.850
our caregivers. We are so frail, we could
be tripped up by a twig; the family cat is

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:24.760
like a tiger. We need help crossing the road,
putting on our coat, writing our name. But

00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:31.660
our vulnerability is as much emotional. We
can’t begin to understand our strange circumstances:

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:36.980
who we are, where our feelings come from,
why we’re sad or furious, how our parents

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:42.000
fit into the wider scheme, and why they behave
as they do. We necessarily take what the big

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:48.099
people around us say as an inviolable truth;
we can’t help but exaggerate our parents’

00:02:48.099 --> 00:02:53.469
role on the planet. We are condemned to be
enmeshed in their attitudes, ambitions, fears

00:02:53.469 --> 00:03:02.000
and inclinations. Our upbringing is fundamentally
always particular and peculiar. Being children,

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.250
we can brush very little of it off. We are
without a skin. If a parent shouts at us,

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.970
the foundations of the earth tremble. We can’t
tell that some of the harsh words weren’t

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:18.450
perhaps entirely meant, or had their origins
in a tricky day at work or are the reverberations

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.720
of the adult’s own childhood; it simply
feels as if an all-powerful, all knowing giant

00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:30.820
has decided, for certain good (if as yet unknown)
reasons that we are to be annihilated. Nor

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:35.170
can we understand, when a parent goes away
for the weekend or relocates to another country,

00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:39.370
that they didn’t leave us because we did
something wrong or because we are unworthy

00:03:39.370 --> 00:03:44.970
of their love but because even adults aren’t
always in control of their own destinies.

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:48.840
If parents are in the kitchen raising their
voices, it can seem as though these two people

00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:54.799
must hate one another inordinately. The altercation
the children overhear (there was a slammed

00:03:54.799 --> 00:04:00.760
door and several swear words) can feel catastrophic,
as though everything safe is about to disintegrate.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:06.700
There is no evidence anywhere within the child’s
grasp that arguments are a normal part of

00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:11.400
relationships; and that a couple may be entirely
committed to a life-long union and at the

00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:17.220
same time forcefully express a wish that the
other might go to hell. Children are equally

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:22.130
helpless before the distinctive theories of
the parents. They can’t understand that

00:04:22.130 --> 00:04:26.550
an insistence they not mix with another family
from school, or that they follow particular

00:04:26.550 --> 00:04:32.699
dress codes or worry as much as they do about
dirt or being late represent a very partial

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:37.800
understanding of priorities. Children don’t
have a job. They can’t go elsewhere. They

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:45.490
have no extended social network. Even at its
best, childhood is an open prison. As a result

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:50.900
of the peculiarities of these early years,
we get distorted. Things within us start to

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:55.770
grow in odd directions. We find we can’t
easily trust, or need to keep cleaning the

00:04:55.770 --> 00:05:00.419
room, or get unusually scared around people
who raise their voices. No one needs to do

00:05:00.419 --> 00:05:06.650
anything particularly shocking, illegal, sinister
or wicked to us for very serious distortions

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:13.280
to unfold. The causes of our Primal Wound
are rarely outwardly dramatic but its effect

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:18.599
is rarely anything short of momentous and
long-lasting. Such is the fragility of childhood,

00:05:18.599 --> 00:05:25.289
nothing outwardly appalling need have happened
to us for us to wind up inwardly profoundly

00:05:25.289 --> 00:05:30.639
scrambled. We know the point well enough from
tragedy. In the tragic tales of the Ancient

00:05:30.639 --> 00:05:36.190
Greeks, it is not enormous errors and slips
that unleash drama: it is the tiniest, most

00:05:36.190 --> 00:05:42.551
innocent errors. From seemingly minor starting
points, terrible consequences unfurl. Our

00:05:42.551 --> 00:05:47.979
emotional lives are similarly tragic in structure.
Everyone around us may have been trying to

00:05:47.979 --> 00:05:52.410
do their best to us as children and yet we
have ended up now, as adults, nursing certain

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:59.250
major hurts which continue to make us so much
less than we might be. Lastly, and most poignantly,

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:04.320
it’s a feature of the imbalances that stem
from childhood wounds that they don’t cleanly

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:10.171
reveal their origins, either to our own minds
or, consequently, to the world at large. We

00:06:10.171 --> 00:06:16.349
aren’t really sure why we run away so much,
or so often get angry, or have a proud, haughty

00:06:16.349 --> 00:06:22.889
air, or underachieve or cling excessively
to people we love. We simply assume this is

00:06:22.889 --> 00:06:28.550
the way we are – and are assessed accordingly.
Because the sources of our ailments escape

00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:33.860
us, they don’t feature in the explanations
for why people are as they are and we miss

00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:39.750
out on a vital source of sympathy. Our problems
begin with a wound which, if it were known

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:45.110
and adequately explained, would naturally
elicit tender understanding. But because the

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:50.509
consequences it breeds tend to be so much
less appealing, and explanations are lacking,

00:06:50.509 --> 00:06:56.360
we are left open to disdain, sarcasm and our
own self-hatred. Our wound may have begun

00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:01.680
with a feeling of invisibility, but now it
looks as if we’re just show-offs. Maybe

00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.871
it began with being let down, but now we simply
come across as crazily controlling. Perhaps

00:07:07.871 --> 00:07:15.250
it started with a bullying, competitive father,
now it seems as if we are simply spineless.

00:07:15.250 --> 00:07:19.759
We make our lives tougher than they should
be because we insist on thinking of people,

00:07:19.759 --> 00:07:26.879
ourselves and others, as evil and mean rather
than, as is almost invariably the case, primarily

00:07:26.879 --> 00:07:38.110
the victims of what we have all in some ways
gone through: an extremely tricky early history.
