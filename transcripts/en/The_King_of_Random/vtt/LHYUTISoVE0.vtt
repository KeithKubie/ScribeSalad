In today's video,

00:00:01.033 --> 00:00:04.318
we are seeing if it's possible
to carve eggshells using

00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:06.060
the acid found in vinegar.

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.020
[Music]

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:13.200
Guys, in the previous video,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:15.633
you saw me dissolve
an eggshell to make

00:00:15.633 --> 00:00:18.900
a rubber egg using the acetic
acid found in vinegar.

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:21.100
So today, I want to put
that to the test.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:23.570
You've probably seen
those really cool eggs

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:24.450
that people carve,

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:26.300
and make really
really pretty designs.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:28.771
Well, they're beautiful,
but they take a lot of time.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:31.100
I want to see if we can make
a cheap method today.

00:00:31.480 --> 00:00:32.358
Here's the basic idea.

00:00:32.358 --> 00:00:35.300
We have three different
substances that should make

00:00:35.300 --> 00:00:38.300
egg shells impervious
to the acid found in vinegar.

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:39.700
Let's see if we can carve

00:00:39.700 --> 00:00:42.300
patterns on these shells
using these substances.

00:00:42.580 --> 00:00:44.273
Now, here's where
this idea came from.

00:00:44.273 --> 00:00:44.891
I'm not sure

00:00:44.891 --> 00:00:47.876
if you've ever seen that really
easy kids science project

00:00:47.876 --> 00:00:48.700
where you use,

00:00:48.700 --> 00:00:52.800
basically, a darkly colored soda
and fluoride toothpaste.

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:53.900
Now, what you do is

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:56.400
you coat one side of an egg
with fluoride toothpaste,

00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:59.400
and you drop it
into a cup full of soda.

00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.635
What happens is the egg shell
itself will actually start

00:01:02.635 --> 00:01:05.458
to become a muddled brown
or a dark sort of color

00:01:05.458 --> 00:01:07.001
where the toothpaste isn't.

00:01:07.001 --> 00:01:09.800
The basic idea there is
that it's showing you just

00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:12.666
how fluoride protects
the enamel on your teeth,

00:01:12.666 --> 00:01:15.196
and what soda can do
to your teeth as well.

00:01:15.196 --> 00:01:18.206
So, I want to go ahead and see
if using toothpaste,

00:01:18.206 --> 00:01:21.029
we can basically put
a design on to an egg shell,

00:01:21.029 --> 00:01:22.400
drop it into some vinegar,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.400
and see if it'll
actually protect it

00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:26.000
from the acetic acid
found in it.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.200
There's two other things
I want to try as well,

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.400
both a clear nail polish
and a clear acrylic varnish.

00:01:31.400 --> 00:01:33.200
Now, the reason why is
because I want to see

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.599
if just putting a coating
on the outside of the shell

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:37.400
is going to protect it
from the vinegar.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.040
I'm not sure if it will,
but I wanna find out.

00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.100
All right, so we've
got our supplies.

00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:43.200
We've got our eggs.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:44.400
Let's go ahead and get started.

00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:45.514
So for our first test,

00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:47.900
I'm going to go ahead and try
our fluoride toothpaste.

00:01:47.900 --> 00:01:50.800
Now, I don't really think,
even using a squeezy tube,

00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.600
that's going to come
out very pretty.

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:55.000
So we're going to go ahead and
use a dosing syringe to get

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.400
that toothpaste into a design
on our egg shell.

00:01:58.340 --> 00:01:59.240
That should work.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:01.300
All right, let's see
if we can make this happen.

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:03.300
Now, normally,
when you carve an egg,

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.200
you want it to go
all the way around.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.900
I'm not going to worry
about that today

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:09.100
because I want to be able
to set this down to see

00:02:09.100 --> 00:02:10.500
if we can dry just a little.

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:12.300
So, we'll just do
one side of each.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.575
So, anywhere
that our toothpaste,

00:02:14.575 --> 00:02:15.500
or our paint,

00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.400
or our nail polish
is going to be,

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.800
that's where, hopefully,
the eggshell will not dissolve.

00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:21.720
All right.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:23.200
Next up, clear nail polish.

00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.160
Quick drying.

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.280
So, for our nail polish,

00:02:25.297 --> 00:02:27.900
and our acrylic varnish
or polyurethane varnish,

00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:28.828
I'm going to go ahead

00:02:28.828 --> 00:02:30.734
and make our designs
a little more intricate

00:02:30.734 --> 00:02:32.284
because I'm crossing my fingers

00:02:32.284 --> 00:02:34.102
at these might work just
a little bit better,

00:02:34.102 --> 00:02:36.820
simply because I'm not sure
our toothpaste is going to dry.

00:02:36.820 --> 00:02:38.700
So we're going to go ahead
and leave this one for now.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.603
Start on our acrylic,

00:02:39.603 --> 00:02:42.100
and once this is dry, we'll go
ahead and do the other side.

00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:53.740
[Music]

00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:54.540
All right.

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.219
One side on the
acrylic egg done.

00:02:56.219 --> 00:02:58.500
So now that our nail
polish egg is dry,

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:00.477
I'm going to go and flip
it over, work on that

00:03:00.477 --> 00:03:01.400
while this one dries.

00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.940
[Music]

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:10.400
So, it is much harder to see
the acrylic paint on this egg,

00:03:10.400 --> 00:03:11.511
but that's the point.

00:03:11.511 --> 00:03:13.056
By the time everything dries,

00:03:13.056 --> 00:03:14.920
and if this works,
I want it to look

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:16.197
like just a regular egg.

00:03:16.197 --> 00:03:18.700
So I'm liking the fact
that it's so hard to see.

00:03:18.700 --> 00:03:19.200
All right.

00:03:19.200 --> 00:03:20.180
So while those dry,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.423
I actually have one other
idea for our eggs.

00:03:22.423 --> 00:03:23.976
Now, right here,
I've got an egg

00:03:23.976 --> 00:03:25.349
that I hollowed out earlier.

00:03:25.349 --> 00:03:28.000
You can see that I've put
little pin holes through it,

00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000
and then blown out
all of the guts.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:32.400
The reason why is
because my hope is

00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:33.947
that without the inside,

00:03:33.947 --> 00:03:37.680
it may actually allow
the vinegar to seep into it too,

00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:39.100
might make it
a little bit easier

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:41.550
for the eggshell to dissolve
wherever I don't have

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:42.622
anything covering it.

00:03:42.622 --> 00:03:43.900
Let's see what we can do.

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:57.560
[Music]

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.160
While that dries again,
let's go to the next one.

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:10.000
[Music]

00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.360
I have the nicest
handwriting, guys.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:15.200
Plain egg, and just within
a couple of seconds,

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:18.908
you can start to see the carbon
dioxide bubbles forming

00:04:18.908 --> 00:04:20.836
on the surface of that shell.

00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:22.420
Our toothpaste egg,

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.000
which is just
a messy nightmare.

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.400
Let's be honest here.

00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:27.840
Nail polish.

00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:31.900
Our regular acrylic paint.

00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:33.600
And our hollow egg,

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.194
which is only just
occurring to me

00:04:35.194 --> 00:04:37.100
that I think it's gonna float.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:40.407
So, most of this egg is already
covered in acrylic paint.

00:04:40.407 --> 00:04:44.420
So I'm just going to make sure
that the part with TKOR is faced down.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:46.460
Fingers crossed that works.

00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:47.860
Oh, yeah,

00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:49.400
that's just going
to sit like that.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.500
Now, this is
a good sign already.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:54.000
You can see
on the nail polish egg

00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:55.900
and the acrylic paint egg,

00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.700
that is solid not hollow,

00:04:57.700 --> 00:05:00.100
you can see that
where I've got the acrylic paint

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.276
and the nail polish,

00:05:01.276 --> 00:05:03.829
the bubbles are forming
around those places.

00:05:03.829 --> 00:05:04.946
That's a good sign.

00:05:04.946 --> 00:05:07.300
We don't necessarily
need to cover these up,

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:09.400
but it smells a lot
like vinegar in here.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:11.703
So I'm going to go ahead and
cover the tops with saran wrap.

00:05:11.703 --> 00:05:12.955
We'll leave him for 24 hours.

00:05:12.955 --> 00:05:13.700
See what happens.

00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:27.900
[Music]

00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.800
All right, guys, so I'm going
to be honest with you.

00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:31.500
I left these eggs
over the weekend,

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.480
and most of them died.

00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:35.800
By died, I mean
that they completely dissolved.

00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:38.000
Some of them were
just total messes,

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.400
and there wasn't anything left.

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.900
So, we started a new batch.

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.894
These ones have been
in here about 24 hours.

00:05:42.894 --> 00:05:44.100
There were two that I left

00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:46.000
because I thought
they were pretty interesting.

00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000
The toothpaste egg

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.400
and our hollow acrylic egg
did things I wasn't expecting.

00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.091
So let's go and take
a look at all of these,

00:05:52.091 --> 00:05:53.900
and just kind of show you
how these turned out.

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:56.486
You've seen us make a rubber egg
before by dissolving off

00:05:56.486 --> 00:05:59.000
the shell using acetic acid
found in vinegar before.

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.800
So, this is just
one of those eggs,

00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:02.000
and how it's done.

00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:05.780
Shell itself is slime, basically.

00:06:05.780 --> 00:06:07.100
What you're left with is just

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.343
a rubber bouncy egg that you
wouldn't want to bounce,

00:06:10.343 --> 00:06:11.590
because it's rotten.

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.900
That'd be disgusting.

00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:14.820
We have one very,

00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:17.900
very squishy egg with almost all
of its shell dissolved.

00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.000
You can see where it kind
of raised up to the surface.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.980
This part wasn't fully
submerged into vinegar.

00:06:22.980 --> 00:06:25.500
But even that would come off
if I just rubbed it enough.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:27.200
All right, so
our toothpaste egg.

00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:30.600
I think there's still
an egg in there.

00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.272
This actually just ate
all the way through.

00:06:33.272 --> 00:06:36.200
Now, it had started to crack
and spider webbed,

00:06:36.200 --> 00:06:37.400
and now, the shell is,

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.950
it's still there much more
than the other egg shell,

00:06:39.950 --> 00:06:42.600
but it's still goofy,
and it could still come off.

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:47.120
So, is toothpaste going to save
an eggshell from acetic acid?

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.100
No, it's not.

00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:50.340
You can just see the difference.

00:06:50.340 --> 00:06:52.634
So we're going to go ahead and
wait on our two painted eggs.

00:06:52.634 --> 00:06:55.083
I think these two actually
probably has some good results.

00:06:55.083 --> 00:06:55.900
So fingers crossed.

00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.100
I want to take a look
at our hollow egg real quick

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.714
because this one also looked
like it was going to work,

00:07:00.714 --> 00:07:01.947
like the toothpaste one.

00:07:01.947 --> 00:07:03.900
Now, the toothpaste
one was fascinating

00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.400
because it held out longer
than the normal plain egg did.

00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:08.938
With our hollow egg,

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.800
it survived but in
a fascinating way.

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.920
I don't even think I can take
this out of the vinegar

00:07:14.920 --> 00:07:18.500
because all that's left
right now is the bubble skin.

00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.820
There's nothing it's
protecting on the inside.

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:22.700
So, while there are some places
that you can see

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.800
that the acrylic paint sort
of saved the shell,

00:07:24.800 --> 00:07:27.900
I think it actually got inside,
ate up and around in it,

00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:31.300
and so now, it's just,
well, it's that.

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:32.660
Yeah, there's vinegar,

00:07:32.660 --> 00:07:33.900
and this is what makes me think

00:07:33.900 --> 00:07:35.900
that the shelf fully
got eaten through is

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.200
because you can actually see
that there's liquid inside.

00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:39.835
This was a fully hollow egg.

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:41.760
It just soaked up the vinegar.

00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:42.800
The vinegar somehow managed

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:45.100
to get in the egg through
those little tiny pinholes.

00:07:45.100 --> 00:07:46.249
I don't even know where,

00:07:46.249 --> 00:07:48.600
but the shell itself is just
flaking into pieces

00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.482
in my hand now.

00:07:49.482 --> 00:07:51.300
So, that's really gross.

00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:54.000
So first, we'll go ahead
and take a look at our egg

00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:55.721
that was painted
with nail polish.

00:07:55.721 --> 00:07:56.400
Now, already,

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.436
I'm kind of excited
because you can actually see

00:07:58.436 --> 00:07:59.800
that the shell is still there,

00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:01.800
intact in some places
where I painted it on.

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:04.429
So my hope is that any place
where you can still

00:08:04.429 --> 00:08:06.500
see white stripes
where the paint was,

00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:09.280
I'm hoping that that is
still solid shell,

00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.300
so that when we pop it,

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:12.100
and we try and drain
out the egg itself,

00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.600
that will stay in place.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.220
[Music]

00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:18.260
Aha!

00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:20.520
So far, so good.

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800
This is hilarious.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.500
The egg,

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:25.700
because the egg was starting
to rot, it's expanded.

00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:28.200
So if you get a top down view,
you can actually see

00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:31.560
that the egg itself is expanding
from where the shell was,

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:33.760
which means this is going
to smell really great

00:08:33.765 --> 00:08:34.900
when I break it open.

00:08:36.200 --> 00:08:37.180
Gross.

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:38.480
Gross, gross.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.860
[Music]

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.400
Oh my gosh.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:49.020
It worked.

00:08:49.240 --> 00:08:50.220
There you go.

00:08:50.220 --> 00:08:52.080
Laser light show egg.

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.300
We'll see if we can carve
out that lining.

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:56.835
See if we could just get
that shell like we want.

00:08:56.840 --> 00:08:58.940
Yes, in case you're wondering,

00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:02.600
the entire studio smells
like rotten egg and vinegar.

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:07.100
A carved egg using
nail polish and acid.

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:10.100
Let's take a look
at our polyurethane paint egg.

00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:12.900
Hopefully, it'll pour
out just as easy.

00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:14.205
I'm a little bit more concerned.

00:09:14.205 --> 00:09:16.000
If you take a look
at this one, you'll notice

00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.300
that it doesn't look
like the acetic acid is eaten

00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:19.837
through as much of the shell.

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.600
Also, there seems
to be some cracks up

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.960
at the top on one side.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:24.580
I'm just very glad

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.680
that Nate isn't in
the studio today.

00:09:26.680 --> 00:09:29.040
He's not trying to eat
anything right now.

00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:32.500
This one did not survive nearly
as well as the nail polish egg.

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.500
You can actually see the cracks
running through the shell.

00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.100
It still feels pretty stable.

00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:38.498
I still want to try though.

00:09:38.498 --> 00:09:40.000
It did eat through the sides.

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.900
I don't know
if it's going to work as well,

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.800
but let's find out.

00:09:44.300 --> 00:09:45.100
Okay.

00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:46.700
Well, so far so good.

00:09:47.260 --> 00:09:48.960
Similar results.

00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:50.200
You can definitely see

00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:52.133
that some of these sides
did not hold up as well.

00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:53.380
But they're still there.

00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:55.000
Already lost that one
side right there.

00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:56.900
So I'm not even going
to finish trying.

00:09:56.900 --> 00:09:58.900
I am going to try
and peel out that lining

00:09:58.900 --> 00:10:00.250
because the nail polish egg

00:10:00.250 --> 00:10:02.100
did survive me pulling
out the lining.

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.100
This one, just me trying
to slice through isn't working.

00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:06.100
If I pull it out,

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:08.100
I have a feeling this whole
thing's going to crumble.

00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:08.800
But let's see.

00:10:08.800 --> 00:10:12.660
[Music]

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:13.760
As I'm working,

00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:15.460
the whole egg
is just crumbling.

00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:18.200
So I think that's as good as
we're gonna get with regular,

00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.900
just clear acrylic paint.

00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:23.300
However, compared to
our fully hollow egg,

00:10:23.400 --> 00:10:24.700
we're still doing better.

00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:26.000
So, comparison time.

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.882
We've got our fresh regular egg,

00:10:27.882 --> 00:10:30.000
we've got our control
test plain egg,

00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:31.400
and egg with toothpaste,

00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:33.900
and the egg with acrylic paint,

00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:38.360
a hollow acrylic paint egg,
and then, shockingly to me,

00:10:38.361 --> 00:10:39.900
the nail polish egg.

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:42.300
That's the one that survived,
and now, obviously,

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.701
I was just going for a very
quick and easy design.

00:10:44.701 --> 00:10:47.200
Something that I thought
would structurally hold up,

00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:48.760
which it obviously did.

00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:50.497
But if you wanted
to spend some time,

00:10:50.497 --> 00:10:52.900
even with another sort
of clear nail polish,

00:10:52.900 --> 00:10:54.679
and really put in some detail,

00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.000
you can carve an egg
without having to do much work.

00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.900
All I got to do is paint it, put
it in some vinegar overnight.

00:11:00.900 --> 00:11:05.060
[Music]

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:06.400
Hey guys, thanks for watching.
