00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:02.969
Let's discuss symmetric encryption.

00:00:02.969 --> 00:00:07.480
Recall that in symmetric encryption,
the same key is used for

00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:09.880
both encryption and decryption.

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:13.140
The input is a plain text message.

00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:17.460
The encryption algorithm takes the plain
text input, along with the encryption

00:00:17.460 --> 00:00:21.120
key, and processes the plain
text using substitution and

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.570
permutation to produce ciphertext.

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:28.980
The decryption algorithm performs
a reverse of the encryption process.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:33.570
It takes as input, the ciphertext,
and the key, which is the same

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.630
that was used for encryption, and
it produced the original plain text.
