00:00:03.919 --> 00:00:07.799
Kuala Lumpur is the largest and most influential
city of Malaysia.

00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:13.450
A population of Malays, Chinese, Indians,
and others form around the world, makes the

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:19.500
city a melting pot of coexisting cultures
that each preserves their own customs, traditions,

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:20.690
and cuisines.

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:26.730
The mixture of ethnicities, ancient architecture
and modern skyscrapers, and most importantly,

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:31.160
the mouthwatering food, makes Kuala Lumpur
a fantastic city to visit.

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:38.149
Now, let's start with these 11 things to do
in Kuala Lumpur.

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:43.489
Nothing dominates the skyline and screams
Kuala Lumpur more than the monster twin towers,

00:00:43.489 --> 00:00:45.019
which come in at number one.

00:00:45.019 --> 00:00:48.429
So, I am at the base of the Petronas Towers.

00:00:48.429 --> 00:00:52.390
These are by far the most iconic landmarks
in the city.

00:00:52.390 --> 00:00:59.199
At the ground level is a big shopping center,
and then, you can actually go to the, I think

00:00:59.199 --> 00:01:04.600
it's the forty first floor or something like
that, and there's a sky bridge where you can

00:01:04.600 --> 00:01:06.860
get a great view of the city from there.

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:11.320
There’s a beautiful park right next to the
Petronas Towers that has some of the best

00:01:11.320 --> 00:01:16.040
drinking fountains I’ve ever seen in my
life.

00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:20.150
Number two is the historical district of old
central Kuala Lumpur.

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:23.179
The area makes a great place for a walking
tour.

00:01:23.179 --> 00:01:28.600
Despite all the modern sky scrapers in Kuala
Lumpur, there's still a historic area.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:34.539
I'm just near the old railroad station, and
I'm doing a little walk around to see some

00:01:34.539 --> 00:01:47.469
of the most historical, and some of the most
prized buildings in Kuala Lumpur.

00:01:47.469 --> 00:01:52.880
So now I'm here at the entrance of Kuala Lumpur's
National Mosque.

00:01:52.880 --> 00:02:01.299
Merdeka Square which is the Independence Monument,
and it's home to a ninety five meter flag

00:02:01.299 --> 00:02:05.619
pole which is among the tallest in the entire
world.

00:02:05.619 --> 00:02:08.060
Number three is the Menara KL Tower.

00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:13.049
At four hundred twenty one meters in height,
the insanely tall communications tower touches

00:02:13.049 --> 00:02:14.330
the heavens.

00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:19.200
Dine at a sky restaurant or just admire the
unbelievable panoramic view from the top.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:27.849
One the top of the KL Meanara Tower, at some
absurd height up here, pretty scared out of

00:02:27.849 --> 00:02:40.830
my mind to sit on this ledge, but luckily
I am strapped in so I don't fall off.

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.050
Number four is Little India, known better
as Brickfields.

00:02:44.050 --> 00:02:52.709
KL has a lot of Indian areas of town, but
the area of Brickfields is known as the largest

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.799
little Indian in Kuala Lumpur.

00:02:54.799 --> 00:03:00.220
Brickfields is home to Hindu temples, small
food markets, stores selling saris and other

00:03:00.220 --> 00:03:05.060
Indian clothing, and a tempting collection
of mostly south indian restaurants.

00:03:05.060 --> 00:03:08.379
I personally go there for the food.

00:03:08.379 --> 00:03:13.950
Number five, located on Petaling street and
popular with both locals and tourists, is

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.420
Kuala Lumpurs Chinatown.

00:03:16.420 --> 00:03:25.129
I am in Chinatown on Petaling street, and
you can see lots of different stall of clothes,

00:03:25.129 --> 00:03:32.590
mostly clothes, shoes, watches, dvd's, handbags,
all kinds of stuff like that, there are also

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:49.819
lots of restaurants both on this street and
on the streets surrounding the area of Chinatown.

00:03:49.819 --> 00:03:52.579
Number six is the Thean Hou Chinese temple.

00:03:52.579 --> 00:03:57.469
Built by the Hainanese community in KL, the
Daoist temple is dedicated to the Tian Hou

00:03:57.469 --> 00:04:00.540
goddess or the heavenly mother.

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:07.750
I am at the Thean Hou Chinese Temple, it was
built on the side of the hill, so you have

00:04:07.750 --> 00:04:13.480
the Chinese temple but they you also have
a view of Kuala Lumpur on the other side.

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:20.380
Center Market, also known as Pasar Seni is
number seven.

00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:24.710
At one point, it was the original central
market of the city.

00:04:24.710 --> 00:04:30.770
Today I think it's a little bit touristy inside,
but it is a good place if you're looking to

00:04:30.770 --> 00:04:36.140
purchase souvenirs, Malaysian souvenirs, or
a good place to browse around for a little

00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.140
while.

00:04:37.140 --> 00:04:38.390
So, the central market.

00:04:38.390 --> 00:04:43.170
Number eight is the KL Lake Gardens and the
KL Bird Park which includes the world's largest

00:04:43.170 --> 00:04:47.930
in flight aviary - for bird lovers, it shouldn't
be missed.

00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:55.390
The KL Lake gardens right now, walking around,
very nice scenery and also if you are interested,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:05:03.270
there is the KL Bird Park, KL mouse deer park,
the butterfly park, and a hibiscus garden,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:11.980
orchid garden, you name it, it's all right
in this area of KL Lake Gardens.

00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:13.920
Number nine is the Batu Caves.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.580
So I made it to the Batu Caves.

00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:21.170
It's located just thirteen kilometers from
the center of KL, and is one of the most sacred

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:23.260
Hindu religious sites outside of India.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:29.010
The two hundred and seventy two steps to the
top is an easy climb that's rewarded with

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:32.970
a gorgeous cave filled with Hindu religious
shrines.

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:37.200
At the bottom of the cave you'll find a series
of vegetarian restaurants where you can replenish

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.750
your calories after the climb.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.740
Number ten is the central Chow Kit Wet Market.

00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.380
Chow kit market, and it's one of the largest
fresh wet markets in the city.

00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:56.950
And they have some of my absolute favorite
ingredients in the entire world, right down

00:05:56.950 --> 00:05:57.950
here in these aisles.

00:05:57.950 --> 00:05:58.950
Stink bean.

00:05:58.950 --> 00:06:02.530
All the fresh ingredients you could ever need
to prepare a Malay feast are available at

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:03.900
Chow Kit.

00:06:03.900 --> 00:06:07.810
There's also always a delicious array of fresh
tropical fruit as well.

00:06:07.810 --> 00:06:11.160
Did you really think I’d end this list of
things to do in Kuala Lumpur without adding

00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:12.990
food as an attraction?

00:06:12.990 --> 00:06:18.840
For myself and most local Malaysians as well,
it's all about the food - and when you visit

00:06:18.840 --> 00:06:24.310
Kuala Lumpur your mouth is going to rejoice
with the diverse selection of Malay, Chinese,

00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:26.550
and Indian food available.

00:06:26.550 --> 00:06:31.130
Malaysia is one of the best countries in the
world for food, and Kuala Lumpur offers something

00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:33.580
tasty at every corner.

00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:39.710
From Nasi Lemak to ikan bakar, char kuay teow
to bak kut teh, and banana leaf to tandoori

00:06:39.710 --> 00:06:51.650
chicken, Kuala Lumpur is a food paradise.

00:06:51.650 --> 00:06:57.810
So no matter what you're interested in, weather
it be history, shopping, or food, Kuala Lumpur

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:03.680
is bound to have something that will make
you excited.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:13.850
Hey everyone, it's Mark Wiens here, I just
