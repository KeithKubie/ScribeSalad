00:00:03.403 --> 00:00:04.904
FRANK: Get the flyer.
MIKE: Give the double honk.

00:00:04.904 --> 00:00:06.139
Oh, yeah, I forgot.
FRANK: [honks horn]

00:00:06.139 --> 00:00:07.240
MIKE: I'm usually driving.
I don't get the flyer.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.276
FRANK: I know, well...

00:00:10.276 --> 00:00:13.713
MIKE: Hello!

00:00:13.713 --> 00:00:14.781
FRANK: That must be
him in there.

00:00:14.781 --> 00:00:16.616
I see him.
MIKE: Yeah.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.151
Hey, buddy, what's up?

00:00:18.151 --> 00:00:20.186
JAY: Hey, not too much.
What are you guys up to?

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:22.555
MIKE: Oh, nothing, just, uh...
FRANK: Freezing!

00:00:22.555 --> 00:00:24.124
MIKE: ...come to check you out.
I'm Mike.

00:00:24.124 --> 00:00:25.592
JAY: Hi, Mike; Jay.
MIKE: This is Frankie.

00:00:25.592 --> 00:00:26.993
FRANK: Frank, nice to meet you.
JAY: Hey, Frank.

00:00:26.993 --> 00:00:28.194
MIKE: Hey, what are you doing,
some inventory or something?

00:00:28.194 --> 00:00:29.429
JAY: Well, just
checking things out.

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.197
MIKE: Alright, here's
some more paperwork for ya.

00:00:31.197 --> 00:00:33.400
JAY: Family business,
we were fuel distributors

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:36.736
where we'd haul fuel
to individuals, farmers.

00:00:36.736 --> 00:00:39.572
The collection came
remnants from the business.

00:00:39.572 --> 00:00:41.040
JAY: Let's go
in the building here.

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.345
This building my dad built, oh,
35 years ago for our business.

00:00:45.345 --> 00:00:46.579
FRANK: Wow.
MIKE: Dang.

00:00:46.579 --> 00:00:48.948
FRANK: Oh, Mike...
JAY: Kind of got stuffed full.

00:00:48.948 --> 00:00:50.183
MIKE: Wow.

00:00:50.183 --> 00:00:51.684
FRANK: This is obviously
where his dad kept

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:56.456
all of his prized possessions.
It's like a museum in here.

00:00:56.456 --> 00:00:57.824
FRANK: Okay, Jay, you know,
this is what I call

00:00:57.824 --> 00:00:59.392
a popsicle sign.
JAY: Um-hm.

00:00:59.392 --> 00:01:01.227
FRANK: It's Mobiloil,
it's got the gargoyle on it.

00:01:01.227 --> 00:01:03.596
It has the original base.

00:01:03.596 --> 00:01:05.298
And when I look at
the sign here...

00:01:05.298 --> 00:01:06.900
JAY: Um-hm.
FRANK: ...it's been touched up.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:10.103
The retail on it would be around
1,200 in the condition it is.

00:01:10.103 --> 00:01:11.404
JAY: Um-hm.

00:01:11.404 --> 00:01:14.908
FRANK: I'd be into it for 875.

00:01:14.908 --> 00:01:16.776
JAY: Tell you what.

00:01:16.776 --> 00:01:19.412
1,000 bucks
and you take it.

00:01:19.412 --> 00:01:21.514
FRANK: 950.

00:01:21.514 --> 00:01:24.451
Get me somewhere else.
JAY: 1,050.

00:01:24.451 --> 00:01:26.119
FRANK: I'll do it for 1,000.

00:01:26.119 --> 00:01:29.055
[laughs] 1,000 sounds
better than 1,050.

00:01:29.055 --> 00:01:30.723
JAY: My dad didn't
throw anything away,

00:01:30.723 --> 00:01:33.760
and that's because he was
a Depression-era baby.

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:35.862
And everything was saved.

00:01:35.862 --> 00:01:40.366
MIKE: So, Linco, this was
actually Ohio Oil Company.

00:01:40.366 --> 00:01:41.835
And they bought
another oil company

00:01:41.835 --> 00:01:43.536
named Lincoln Oil Company,
and they--

00:01:43.536 --> 00:01:46.206
but they marketed
their products as Linco.

00:01:46.206 --> 00:01:47.373
This is a rare sign.

00:01:47.373 --> 00:01:48.908
This is the money
shot right here.

00:01:48.908 --> 00:01:50.944
I'd do...

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:53.213
1,600 on it.

00:01:53.213 --> 00:01:55.114
JAY: Go 18.

00:01:55.114 --> 00:01:56.950
MIKE: 1,750.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.886
JAY: C'mon, 18.
It's 50 bucks.

00:01:59.886 --> 00:02:02.856
â™ª

00:02:02.856 --> 00:02:04.591
MIKE: Here's the deal.
All of this stuff

00:02:04.591 --> 00:02:05.859
is really hard to find.

00:02:05.859 --> 00:02:09.362
We very much appreciate
you letting us look at it

00:02:09.362 --> 00:02:10.597
and buy a few pieces.

00:02:10.597 --> 00:02:11.998
'Cause we understand
the importance of it.

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:15.034
JAY: Glad it can get out,
from inside this building,

00:02:15.034 --> 00:02:17.704
just sitting in here collecting
dust, and nobody's seeing it.

00:02:17.704 --> 00:02:21.774
MIKE: Jay's dad was such
a passionate collector.

00:02:21.774 --> 00:02:24.544
Everything that Jay's
father drug home

00:02:24.544 --> 00:02:26.880
now has a second life.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:28.481
MIKE: Hey...

00:02:28.481 --> 00:02:29.682
Come to Nashville,
I'll buy you a beer.

00:02:29.682 --> 00:02:30.950
JAY: Thanks for coming by.
MIKE: Alright, buddy.

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:32.085
Yeah, thank you so much.
FRANK: Yeah.

00:02:32.085 --> 00:02:33.386
JAY: Thanks, Frank.
Nice to meet you guys.

00:02:33.386 --> 00:02:34.554
MIKE: We appreciate you.
FRANK: Nice to meet ya, partner.

00:02:34.554 --> 00:02:35.588
MIKE: Alright.
FRANK: Take care now.

00:02:35.588 --> 00:02:36.689
MIKE: Stay warm!
FRANK: Y'all be good now.

00:02:36.689 --> 00:02:37.724
[honks horn]

00:02:37.724 --> 00:02:40.493
MIKE: See ya, Jay!
JAY: See you, guys!
