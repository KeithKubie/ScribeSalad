00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:03.014
We have a periodic
function depicted here

00:00:03.014 --> 00:00:04.430
and what I want
you to do is think

00:00:04.430 --> 00:00:06.780
about what the midline
of this function is.

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:11.290
The midline is a line,
a horizontal line,

00:00:11.290 --> 00:00:13.700
where half of the
function is above it,

00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.279
and half of the
function is below it.

00:00:16.279 --> 00:00:18.320
And then I want you to
think about the amplitude.

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:21.890
How far does this function
vary from that midline-- either

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:24.719
how far above does it go or
how far does it go below it?

00:00:24.719 --> 00:00:27.010
It should be the same amount
because the midline should

00:00:27.010 --> 00:00:29.464
be between the highest
and the lowest points.

00:00:29.464 --> 00:00:30.880
And then finally,
think about what

00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:35.190
the period of this function is.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.230
How much do you have
to have a change in x

00:00:37.230 --> 00:00:39.470
to get to the same
point in the cycle

00:00:39.470 --> 00:00:40.705
of this periodic function?

00:00:40.705 --> 00:00:42.830
So I encourage you to pause
the video now and think

00:00:42.830 --> 00:00:44.830
about those questions.

00:00:44.830 --> 00:00:46.802
So let's tackle
the midline first.

00:00:46.802 --> 00:00:48.260
So one way to think
about is, well,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.740
how high does this function go?

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:55.790
Well, the highest y-value for
this function we see is 4.

00:00:55.790 --> 00:00:58.709
It keeps hitting 4 on
a fairly regular basis.

00:00:58.709 --> 00:01:00.250
And we'll talk about
how regular that

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:01.770
is when we talk
about the period.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:04.510
And what's the lowest value
that this function gets to?

00:01:04.510 --> 00:01:09.470
Well, it gets to y
equals negative 2.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:13.730
So what's halfway
between 4 and negative 2?

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.750
Well, you could eyeball
it, or you could count,

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:17.166
or you could,
literally, just take

00:01:17.166 --> 00:01:19.030
the average between
4 and negative 2.

00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:23.990
So 4-- so the midline is going
to be the horizontal line-- y

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.610
is equal to 4 plus
negative 2 over 2.

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.600
Just literally the
mean, the arithmetic

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.500
mean, between 4 and negative 2.

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:34.870
The average of 4 and
negative 2, which

00:01:34.870 --> 00:01:37.240
is just going to
be equal to one.

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:40.780
So the line y equals
1 is the midline.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:43.310
So that's the midline
right over here.

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:49.410
And you see that it's kind
of cutting the function where

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.040
you have half of the
function is above it,

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:54.310
and half of the
function is below it.

00:01:54.310 --> 00:01:55.255
So that's the midline.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.110
Now, let's think
about the amplitude.

00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:02.660
Well, the amplitude is
how much this function

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:05.055
varies from the midline--
either above the midline

00:02:05.055 --> 00:02:05.930
or below the midline.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:06.970
And the midline
is in the middle,

00:02:06.970 --> 00:02:08.928
so it's going to be the
same amount whether you

00:02:08.928 --> 00:02:10.639
go above or below.

00:02:10.639 --> 00:02:13.790
One way to say it is, well,
at this maximum point, right

00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.620
over here, how far above
the midline is this?

00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:22.210
Well, to get from 1
to 4 you have to go--

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.831
you're 3 above the midline.

00:02:23.831 --> 00:02:25.830
Another way of thinking
about this maximum point

00:02:25.830 --> 00:02:28.410
is y equals 4 minus y equals 1.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:33.810
Well, your y can go as much
as 3 above the midline.

00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:36.170
Or you could say your
y-value could be as much as 3

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:37.290
below the midline.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.920
That's this point right over
here, 1 minus 3 is negative 1.

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:46.530
So your amplitude right
over here is equal to 3.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.840
You could vary as much as
3, either above the midline

00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.630
or below the midline.

00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:53.006
Finally, the period.

00:02:53.006 --> 00:02:54.380
And when I think
about the period

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.040
I try to look for a relatively
convenient spot on the curve.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:00.980
And I'm calling this
a convenient spot

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.800
because it's a nice-- when
x is at negative 2, y is it

00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:07.310
one-- it's at a
nice integer value.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:10.140
And so what I want to do is
keep traveling along this curve

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:14.510
until I get to the same y-value
but not just the same y-value

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.960
but I get the same
y-value that I'm also

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.340
traveling in the same direction.

00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:21.470
So for example, let's
travel along this curve.

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:25.010
So essentially our
x is increasing.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:26.850
Our x keeps increasing.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.510
Now you might say, hey, have
I completed a cycle here

00:03:29.510 --> 00:03:32.940
because, once again,
y is equal to 1?

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.090
You haven't completed a cycle
here because notice over here

00:03:36.090 --> 00:03:39.680
where our y is increasing
as x increases.

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:42.220
Well here our y is
decreasing as x increases.

00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.570
Our slope is positive here.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:44.940
Our slope is negative here.

00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:46.880
So this isn't the same
point on the cycle.

00:03:46.880 --> 00:03:50.407
We need to get to the point
where y once again equals 1.

00:03:50.407 --> 00:03:52.990
Or we could say, especially in
this case, we're at the midline

00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:55.440
again, but our
slope is increasing.

00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:56.540
So let's just keep going.

00:03:59.830 --> 00:04:02.950
So that gets us to
right over there.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:06.290
So notice, now we have
completed one cycle.

00:04:06.290 --> 00:04:10.960
So the change in x needed
to complete one cycle.

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:13.970
That is your period.

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:19.079
So to go from negative 2
to 0, your period is 2.

00:04:19.079 --> 00:04:20.940
So your period here is 2.

00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:22.390
And you could do it again.

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:23.690
So we're at that point.

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.440
Let's see, we want to
get back to a point

00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:27.820
where we're at the
midline-- and I just

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:29.802
happen to start right
over here at the midline.

00:04:29.802 --> 00:04:31.510
I could have started
really at any point.

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:32.830
You want to get
to the same point

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:34.330
but also where the
slope is the same.

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:36.350
We're at the same point
in the cycle once again.

00:04:36.350 --> 00:04:40.370
So I could go-- so if I travel
1 I'm at the midline again

00:04:40.370 --> 00:04:42.060
but I'm now going down.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.720
So I have to go further.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:48.140
Now I am back at that
same point in the cycle.

00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.200
I'm at y equals 1 and
the slope is positive.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:51.880
And notice, I traveled.

00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:55.160
My change in x was the
length of the period.

00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:57.202
It was 2.
