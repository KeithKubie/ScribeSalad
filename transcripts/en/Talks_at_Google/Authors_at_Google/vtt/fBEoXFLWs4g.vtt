00:00:03.139 --> 00:00:07.720
&gt;&gt;female speaker: Thank you for joining us
at the Google, Authors at Google event today.

00:00:07.720 --> 00:00:12.260
And we have here with us Austin Kleon and
it's my pleasure to introduce him.

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.460
He, this is his second book he's here to talk
about, "Stealing Like an Artist".

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.680
And his first book was "Newspaper Blackout".

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:22.070
And it was a huge success.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:25.039
And here he is, I'll let him do the talking.

00:00:25.039 --> 00:00:27.080
So please welcome.

00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:32.189
[Applause]
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Thanks y'all.

00:00:32.189 --> 00:00:33.829
Thanks for coming.

00:00:33.829 --> 00:00:37.370
It's a sunny day in San Francisco and lovely
outside.

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:40.550
So I really appreciate it.

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:49.360
So I like to start out all of my talks saying
that all advice is autobiographical.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:54.519
It's one of my theories that when people give
you advice they're actually just talking to

00:00:54.519 --> 00:00:57.969
themselves in the past.

00:00:57.969 --> 00:01:07.030
And this book actually is a book in which
I am talking to a previous version of myself.

00:01:07.030 --> 00:01:14.090
I wrote it all down as if I could stick it
in a time machine and send it to the 19-year-old

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:16.210
me.

00:01:16.210 --> 00:01:21.990
And the thing I always like to say is YMMV,
your mileage may vary.

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:23.990
There are no rules.

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:26.549
You take what you need and you leave the rest.

00:01:26.549 --> 00:01:30.229
As the man said.

00:01:30.229 --> 00:01:35.090
Before I talk about "Steal", I wanted to just
talk about, talk quickly about my first book

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:36.610
"Newspaper Blackout".

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:42.700
"Newspaper Blackout" started in 2005 when
I was right out of college and I was facing

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:47.090
a horrible case of what we call writer's block.

00:01:47.090 --> 00:01:51.920
I would sit at my desk all day and stare at
that Microsoft Word screen and the little

00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:56.369
cursor would just kind of blink at me like
it was taunting me.

00:01:56.369 --> 00:01:59.240
And writing had once been a great joy for
me.

00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.180
It had once been a great amount of fun and
now it wasn't fun anymore.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.780
So one day I was sitting at my desk and I
looked at the recycle bin and I noticed a

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:11.160
huge stack of newspapers.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:17.180
And I thought to myself, I don't have any
words and right there next to me are millions

00:02:17.180 --> 00:02:18.320
of them.

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:23.110
So I thought it might be okay if I stole a
couple.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.650
This is what I did, I took one of the markers
I used for drawing and I started making boxes

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:30.860
around interesting words that jumped out at
me.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:35.620
And I started connecting those words into
little phrases and funny sayings.

00:02:35.620 --> 00:02:41.720
And when I was done I blacked out everything
I didn't need.

00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:45.010
And this is kind of what they look like after
I scan them into the computer and play with

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:46.040
the levels a little bit.

00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:53.010
It almost looks like as if the CIA did haikus.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:55.430
And I called them newspaper blackouts.

00:02:55.430 --> 00:03:00.690
And slowly, ever so slowly over time I would
post them to my blog or in my blog and they

00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:05.590
would get mentioned from other blogs and kinda
spread around the Internet.

00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.090
And eventually we collected them in the first
collection of "Newspaper Blackout".

00:03:11.090 --> 00:03:13.769
And that came out about two years ago.

00:03:13.769 --> 00:03:19.420
So I really thought I was ripping off the
government.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:25.180
That's John Lennon's FBI file on the left
and a blackout poem on the right.

00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:31.110
But as happens on the Internet when you put
your stuff out there, you hear from your readers.

00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.530
And I got a lot of e-mails and comments from
readers telling me just how unoriginal my

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.659
idea actually was.

00:03:40.659 --> 00:03:47.860
And the fella they pointed to the most was
the brilliant British artist Tom Phillips.

00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:54.670
In the mid-60s Tom Phillips walked into a
bookstore, picked up the first book he could

00:03:54.670 --> 00:04:00.519
find for three pence and took it home and
he started marking the pages much like I do

00:04:00.519 --> 00:04:02.420
in "Newspaper Blackout".

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:04.810
And he's actually done this for 40 years.

00:04:04.810 --> 00:04:11.590
And his work is incredibly ornate, some of
the pages get very beautiful and colorful

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:15.190
and they are very intense.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:19.670
And the project is called a humument if you
want to look that up later.

00:04:19.670 --> 00:04:23.550
So the funny thing was I started doing some
research into Tom Phillips.

00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:29.511
And it turns out that he actually got the
idea from reading a 1965 Paris review.

00:04:29.511 --> 00:04:33.950
A review with the writer William Burroughs.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:39.510
Burroughs was talking about his cutup method
of writing in which he took a piece of existing

00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:45.980
text, cut into pieces and then rearranged
them so he got new combinations of text.

00:04:45.980 --> 00:04:49.380
And he called that the cutup method.

00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:53.730
What was interesting when I started researching
Burroughs is I found out that he actually

00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.910
got the idea from his buddy Brion Gysin.

00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:03.390
Brion Gysin was preparing a canvas for one
of his paintings and he sliced through a stack

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:08.730
of newspapers and he saw the way the strips
looked and the different word combinations

00:05:08.730 --> 00:05:11.820
that came out from rearranging those strips.

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.010
And what he thought was this might be an interesting
method of making poetry.

00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.310
But the more research I did, the more I found
out that there was actually a fellow who had

00:05:22.310 --> 00:05:26.640
made poetry from the newspaper even before
then.

00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.050
Tristan Tzara in the 1930s.

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:35.440
He walked up in a Paris theater with a hat
and a newspaper, cut up the newspaper into

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.460
pieces put the pieces in the hat and pulled
them out one by one and read them as if they

00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:43.390
were a poem.

00:05:43.390 --> 00:05:48.070
I traced things all the way back to the 1700s.

00:05:48.070 --> 00:05:51.930
To a neighbor of Benjamin Franklins called
Caleb Whitefoord.

00:05:51.930 --> 00:05:57.170
And what Whitefoord would do, back in those
days the newspaper was very new so the columns

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:00.020
were very skinny and the text small.

00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:04.870
So what Caleb Whitefoord would do is he would
sit in the pub with his buddies and he would

00:06:04.870 --> 00:06:09.220
read the newspaper allowed but he wouldn't
read the columns top to bottom he would read

00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.350
across the columns.

00:06:10.350 --> 00:06:17.060
And he would get all kinds of funny combinations
and new juxtapositions.

00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:25.960
So not only was my idea totally unoriginal
it turns out there's a 250-year-old history

00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:30.410
of finding poetry in the newspaper.

00:06:30.410 --> 00:06:32.690
But instead of getting depressed.

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:39.470
Instead of stopping there I decided to keep
on and steal everything I could from those

00:06:39.470 --> 00:06:42.900
people that had come before me.

00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:48.050
And that is where the second book comes into
play.

00:06:48.050 --> 00:06:52.340
Every artist gets asked the question where
do you get your ideas.

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:56.630
And the honest artist answers "I steal them."

00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:58.460
How does an artist look at the world?

00:06:58.460 --> 00:07:00.810
Well first you figure out what's worth stealing.

00:07:00.810 --> 00:07:03.840
And then you move onto the next thing.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.410
That's about all there is to it.

00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:10.790
And when you look at the world this way you
stop worrying about what's good and what's

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:11.790
bad.

00:07:11.790 --> 00:07:17.350
There is only stuff worth stealing and stuff
not worth stealing.

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:20.880
Someone once asked David Bowie if he thought
himself to be an original.

00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:25.810
And he said, "No, not at all I'm more like
a tasteful thief".

00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:33.410
He said that the only art he'll ever study
is the stuff that he can steal from.

00:07:33.410 --> 00:07:36.210
Everything in the world is up for grabs with
this worldview.

00:07:36.210 --> 00:07:41.370
If you don't find something worth stealing
today you might find it worth stealing tomorrow

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.570
or a month or a year from now.

00:07:45.570 --> 00:07:50.620
The writer Jonathan Lethem, he has said that
when people call something original 9 times

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:57.480
out of 10 they just don't know the references
or the original source material involved.

00:07:57.480 --> 00:08:01.760
There was another writer who said, "What is
originality?

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:03.240
Undetected plagiarism."

00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:09.720
What a good artist understands is that nothing
comes from nowhere.

00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:13.880
All creative work builds on what came before.

00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:17.870
Nothing is completely original.

00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.460
This itself is actually not a new idea.

00:08:20.460 --> 00:08:22.270
It's right there in the Bible.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:25.610
Ecclesiastes chapter 1 verse 9.

00:08:25.610 --> 00:08:30.710
"That which has been is what will be done
and there is nothing new under the sun."

00:08:30.710 --> 00:08:36.590
Now some people find this idea completely
depressing.

00:08:36.590 --> 00:08:39.200
But for me it's always filled me with hope.

00:08:39.200 --> 00:08:45.710
As a French writer Andre Gide put it, "Everything
that needs to be said has already been said.

00:08:45.710 --> 00:08:52.500
But since no one was listening the first time
everything must be said again."

00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:58.240
See I think if we are free of the burden of
trying to be completely original we can stop

00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:03.360
trying to make something out of nothing and
we can embrace influence instead of running

00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:05.120
away from it.

00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:13.580
See I have this idea that every new idea is
just a remix or a mash up of one or more previous

00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.670
ideas.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:17.800
And this is a little trick they teach you
in art school, you can play along if you want

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:19.430
to.

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:22.290
You draw a line on a piece of paper.

00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:25.660
And then you draw another line parallel to
it.

00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:27.480
Well how many lines are there on the paper?

00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:31.940
At first you think there's two, there's the
first line you drew and there's a second line

00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:32.940
you drew.

00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:37.880
But then if you look in between them, there
is a line of negative space running in between

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:38.880
them.

00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:43.650
One plus one sometimes equals three.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:47.090
And here's an example of what I'm talking
about.

00:09:47.090 --> 00:09:48.430
Genetics.

00:09:48.430 --> 00:09:51.130
You have a mother and you have a father.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:54.970
You possess features from both of them but
the sum of you [Video Skip]

00:09:54.970 --> 00:10:01.260
You're a remix of your Mom and Dad and all
of your ancestors.

00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:06.520
And just as you have a family genealogy you
also have a genealogy of ideas.

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:09.920
We don't get to pick our families but we can
pick our teachers.

00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.200
And we can pick our friends.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:13.050
And we can pick the music that we listen to.

00:10:13.050 --> 00:10:14.050
And the books that we read.

00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:16.360
And we can pick the movies we see.

00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:20.200
Jay Z actually talks about this in his really
great book "Decoded".

00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:22.520
And I'm gonna read you a passage from that.

00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:30.370
He says, "We were kids without fathers so
we found our fathers on wax and on the streets

00:10:30.370 --> 00:10:31.950
and in history.

00:10:31.950 --> 00:10:37.340
We got to pick and choose the ancestors who
would inspire the world we were going to make

00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.000
for ourselves."

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:43.800
See you are in fact a mash-up of what you
let into your life.

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.000
You are the sum of your influences.

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:54.260
The German writer Goethe says, "We are shaped
and fashioned by what we love."

00:10:54.260 --> 00:11:00.590
I actually think, I think human beings are
collectors but I think artists are especially.

00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:01.990
Not hoarders mind you.

00:11:01.990 --> 00:11:03.950
There is a difference.

00:11:03.950 --> 00:11:08.810
You see hoarders collect indiscriminately
and artists collect selectively.

00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:12.330
They only collect the things that they really
love.

00:11:12.330 --> 00:11:16.210
There's also this economic theory out there
that if you take the incomes of your five

00:11:16.210 --> 00:11:21.910
closest friends and you average them the resolving
number will be pretty close to your own income.

00:11:21.910 --> 00:11:26.630
Well I actually think this is true of our
idea incomes.

00:11:26.630 --> 00:11:31.800
You're only going to be as good as the stuff
that you surround yourself with.

00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.050
My mother used to have this phrase, she used
to say, "Garbage can and garbage out."

00:11:37.050 --> 00:11:39.700
And it used to drive me insane.

00:11:39.700 --> 00:11:41.860
But now I know what she meant.

00:11:41.860 --> 00:11:45.950
Our job as creative folks is to collect ideas.

00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:53.120
And the more ideas you collect the more you
can choose from to be influenced by.

00:11:53.120 --> 00:11:57.100
The filmmaker Jim Jarmusch this is what he
says you should steal.

00:11:57.100 --> 00:12:01.529
And this is kind of a long passage I'm gonna
read it because I think it's really great.

00:12:01.529 --> 00:12:07.810
He says, "Steal from anywhere that resonates
with inspiration or fuels your imagination.

00:12:07.810 --> 00:12:13.330
Devour old films, new films, music, books,
paintings, photographs, poems, dreams, random

00:12:13.330 --> 00:12:19.200
conversation, architecture, bridges, street
signs, trees, clouds, bodies of water, light

00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:20.510
and shadows.

00:12:20.510 --> 00:12:26.100
Select only things to steal from that speak
directly to your soul.

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:29.820
If you do this, your work and your theft will
be authentic."

00:12:29.820 --> 00:12:36.260
Now Marcel Duchamp he said, "I don't believe
in art.

00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.340
I believe in artists."

00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:43.210
I think this is actually a pretty good method
for studying your discipline.

00:12:43.210 --> 00:12:48.750
If you try to devour the history of what he
do all at once, you're gonna choke.

00:12:48.750 --> 00:12:54.690
So I think the best thing to do is to start
chewing on one thinker you really love.

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:57.250
Completely saturate yourself with their work.

00:12:57.250 --> 00:13:00.630
Study everything there is to know about that
thinker.

00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:04.250
And then you find three thinkers that influenced
your favorite thinker.

00:13:04.250 --> 00:13:07.840
And find out everything you can about them.

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.880
And you repeat this as many times as you can.

00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:16.560
You build your own family tree and then you
climb it as far up as you can go.

00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.779
And then once you build your own family tree
it's time to start your own branch.

00:13:21.779 --> 00:13:26.550
See I think seeing yourself as part of a creative
lineage will help you feel less alone when

00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:28.550
you start making your own work.

00:13:28.550 --> 00:13:34.310
I actually hang pictures of my favorite artists
in my studio and a lot of them are dead so

00:13:34.310 --> 00:13:39.170
they're almost like friendly ghosts kind of
urging me forward in my work.

00:13:39.170 --> 00:13:42.730
It's a lot less creepy than it sounds.

00:13:42.730 --> 00:13:48.860
The great thing about dead teachers is they
can't refuse you as a student.

00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:55.400
You can learn whatever you want from them,
they left their lesson plans in their work.

00:13:55.400 --> 00:14:00.190
And I also think it's really important to
school yourself because school is one thing

00:14:00.190 --> 00:14:02.570
and education is another.

00:14:02.570 --> 00:14:04.690
The two don't always overlap.

00:14:04.690 --> 00:14:11.820
The RZA from the Wu-Tang Clan, I once listened
to him on Fresh Air which was strange enough

00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:15.120
but he said this really brilliant thing.

00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:19.360
He said, "Rather I went to school or not I
would always study."

00:14:19.360 --> 00:14:24.279
And that's the key, whether we are in school
or not it's always our job to get our own

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:27.589
education.

00:14:27.589 --> 00:14:30.680
You have to be curious about the world in
which you live.

00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:34.130
You have to look things up, chase down every
reference.

00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.560
Go deeper than anybody else.

00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:39.140
That's how you'll get ahead.

00:14:39.140 --> 00:14:43.690
And I promise I didn't make this slide especially
for y'all here at Google.

00:14:43.690 --> 00:14:45.980
I think you have to Google everything.

00:14:45.980 --> 00:14:47.510
I mean everything.

00:14:47.510 --> 00:14:48.690
Google your dreams.

00:14:48.690 --> 00:14:50.560
Google your problems.

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:54.960
I don't ever ask anyone a question before
I Google it.

00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:59.210
I either find the answer or I come up with
a better question.

00:14:59.210 --> 00:15:07.180
And I like to say there are no stupid questions
there are only "You couldn't Google that?"

00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:10.120
questions.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120
Always be reading.

00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:15.320
Go to the library there's magic in being surrounded
by books.

00:15:15.320 --> 00:15:18.510
Books are the cheapest easiest way to steal
ideas.

00:15:18.510 --> 00:15:21.280
And there's magic in being surrounded by them.

00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:23.860
Get lost in the stacks, read bibliographies.

00:15:23.860 --> 00:15:28.910
It's not the books you start with it's the
book that book leads you to.

00:15:28.910 --> 00:15:31.700
Collect books even if you don't plan on reading
them right away.

00:15:31.700 --> 00:15:37.480
The filmmaker John Waters, he says "There's
nothing more important than an unread library."

00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:42.810
And you have to have a way to save your thefts
for later.

00:15:42.810 --> 00:15:48.250
I recommend that everyone carry a notebook
and a pen with you wherever you go.

00:15:48.250 --> 00:15:49.810
Paper doesn't crash.

00:15:49.810 --> 00:15:52.160
You don't have to charge paper.

00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:56.660
Get used to pulling it out and jotting down
your thoughts and observations.

00:15:56.660 --> 00:15:58.970
Copy your favorite passages out of books.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.680
Record overheard conversations.

00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.360
Doodle when you're on the phone.

00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:09.260
I also have this theory that artists need
pockets, creative people need pockets.

00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.700
The artist David Hockney, he actually had
all his suit coats tailored so he could fit

00:16:14.700 --> 00:16:16.700
a sketchbook in there.

00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:23.260
And the, the other advise that you have to
keep in mind with pockets is that you always

00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:27.140
want to check your pockets for ideas before
you do the laundry.

00:16:27.140 --> 00:16:30.710
[Chuckles]
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Keep a swipe file.

00:16:30.710 --> 00:16:35.140
A swipe file is just what it sounds like a
file to keep track of the stuff you swipe

00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:36.140
from others.

00:16:36.140 --> 00:16:37.900
It can be digital or analog.

00:16:37.900 --> 00:16:41.360
It doesn't matter what form it takes as long
as it works.

00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:44.470
You can keep a scrapbook, cut and paste things
into it.

00:16:44.470 --> 00:16:47.040
Or you can just take pictures with your camera
phone.

00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.550
See something worth stealing put it in the
swipe file.

00:16:49.550 --> 00:16:53.760
Need a little inspiration, open up your swipe
file.

00:16:53.760 --> 00:16:56.680
Newspaper reporters they actually call this
a morgue file.

00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.140
And I like that idea even better because you're
morgue file is where you put all the dead

00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:04.440
stuff that you're gonna reanimate later in
your work.

00:17:04.440 --> 00:17:09.390
In the end you don't want to feel bad about
your theft, always keep in mind Mark Twain's

00:17:09.390 --> 00:17:10.390
advice.

00:17:10.390 --> 00:17:18.910
He said, "It is better to take what does not
belong to you than to let it lie around neglected."

00:17:18.910 --> 00:17:23.670
And I also think it's really important after
you start on your path to creative thievery

00:17:23.670 --> 00:17:28.809
to not wait until you know who you are to
get started doing your work.

00:17:28.809 --> 00:17:34.300
If I had waited to know who I was or what
I was about before I started being creative

00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:39.300
well I'd still be sitting around trying to
figure myself out instead of making things.

00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:45.620
In my experience, it's in the act of making
things and doing our work that we figure out

00:17:45.620 --> 00:17:47.160
who we are.

00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:50.630
Were all ready, let's start making stuff.

00:17:50.630 --> 00:17:52.720
You might be scared to start and that's natural.

00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.620
There's this very real thing that runs rampant
in educated people and it's called imposter

00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.070
syndrome.

00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:08.290
Now the clinical definition of imposter syndrome
is it's a psychological phenomenon in which

00:18:08.290 --> 00:18:13.970
people see, in which people are unable to
internalize their accomplishments.

00:18:13.970 --> 00:18:17.460
But what it really means is it means you feel
like a phony.

00:18:17.460 --> 00:18:18.610
Like you are just winging it.

00:18:18.610 --> 00:18:21.710
That you really have no idea what you're doing.

00:18:21.710 --> 00:18:25.110
Well guess what, nobody does.

00:18:25.110 --> 00:18:29.050
Ask anyone doing truly creative work and they'll
tell you the truth.

00:18:29.050 --> 00:18:32.250
They don't necessarily know where the good
stuff comes from.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:35.700
They just show up and do their thing every
day.

00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:37.890
There's this word called dramaturgy.

00:18:37.890 --> 00:18:42.841
And it's actually a fancy term for something
William Shakespeare spelled out in his play

00:18:42.841 --> 00:18:45.630
"As You Like It", about 400 years ago.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:46.740
He said this.

00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:52.220
He said, "All the world's a stage and all
the men and women merely players.

00:18:52.220 --> 00:18:58.130
They have their exits and entrances and one
man in his time plays many parts."

00:18:58.130 --> 00:19:02.060
Another way to say this, "Fake it till you
make it."

00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:03.710
I actually love this phrase.

00:19:03.710 --> 00:19:06.530
There are two ways to read the phrase "fake
it till you make it".

00:19:06.530 --> 00:19:10.390
One, pretend to be something you're not until
you are.

00:19:10.390 --> 00:19:15.809
Fake it until you're successful, until everybody
sees you the way you want them to.

00:19:15.809 --> 00:19:21.429
Or number two, pretend to be making something
until you actually make something.

00:19:21.429 --> 00:19:25.980
I actually love both readings, you have to
dress for the job you want not the job you

00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:26.980
have.

00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:31.600
And you have to start doing the work that
you really want to be doing.

00:19:31.600 --> 00:19:36.840
I also love this book by Patti Smith called
"Just Kids".

00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.160
It's a story about how two friends who wanted
to be artists moved to New York City and became

00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:43.160
artists.

00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:45.150
And you know how they learned to be artists?

00:19:45.150 --> 00:19:47.000
They pretended to be artists.

00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.670
And my favorite scene from the book, Patti
Smith and Robert Mapplethorpe, they go down

00:19:51.670 --> 00:19:53.000
to Washington Sq.

00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:56.420
Park in New York and they're dressed in their
Gypsy gear.

00:19:56.420 --> 00:20:00.990
And everybody's hanging out and this old tourist
couple comes by and starts gawking at them.

00:20:00.990 --> 00:20:06.500
And the woman, she taps her husband on the
arm and she says, "Robert take their picture

00:20:06.500 --> 00:20:08.650
I think they're artists."

00:20:08.650 --> 00:20:12.390
And the husband says, "Ah get out of here
they're just kids."

00:20:12.390 --> 00:20:14.370
That's where the book gets his title.

00:20:14.370 --> 00:20:20.250
The point is that all the world is a stage.

00:20:20.250 --> 00:20:22.120
Creative work is actually a kind of theatre.

00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:25.880
The stage is the studio, your desk or your
workstation.

00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.810
The costume is your outfit your painting pants,
your business suit or that funny hat that

00:20:30.810 --> 00:20:32.750
helps you think.

00:20:32.750 --> 00:20:34.950
Your props are your tools and your material.

00:20:34.950 --> 00:20:35.950
A laptop.

00:20:35.950 --> 00:20:42.020
This script is just plain old time an hour
here, an hour there, just time measured out

00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:43.540
for things to happen.

00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.250
That's what a script is.

00:20:46.250 --> 00:20:52.910
And the best way I know of going about faking
it till you make it is to start copying.

00:20:52.910 --> 00:20:55.600
Now nobody is born with the style or a voice.

00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.640
We don't come out of the womb knowing who
we are.

00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:02.760
In the beginning we learn by pretending to
be our heroes.

00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:03.940
We learn by copying.

00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:08.040
Now we're talking about practice here, not
plagiarism.

00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:13.140
Plagiarism is taking someone else's work and
trying to pass it off as your own.

00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:15.500
Copying is about reverse engineering.

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:19.980
It's like a mechanic taking apart a car to
see how it works.

00:21:19.980 --> 00:21:22.750
We learned to write by copying the alphabet.

00:21:22.750 --> 00:21:25.830
Musicians learn to play by practicing scales.

00:21:25.830 --> 00:21:28.720
Painters learn to paint by copying the masters.

00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:33.720
And even the masters started out learning
by copying.

00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.520
Even the Beatles started out as a cover band.

00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:42.620
Paul McCartney has said, "I emulated Buddy
Holly, Little Richard, Jerry Lee Lewis, Elvis,

00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:43.630
we all did."

00:21:43.630 --> 00:21:48.200
And McCartney and his partner John Lennon
only became one of the greatest songwriting

00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:53.750
teams in history when they started writing
their own songs as a way to keep other bands

00:21:53.750 --> 00:21:56.670
from copying their set.

00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:02.590
The Beatles knew what Salvador Dali knew which
is, "Those who do not want to imitate anything

00:22:02.590 --> 00:22:06.090
produced nothing."

00:22:06.090 --> 00:22:07.870
Now copying.

00:22:07.870 --> 00:22:10.350
First you have to figure out who to copy.

00:22:10.350 --> 00:22:14.130
And second you have to figure out what to
copy.

00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.420
Now who to copy is actually very easy, you
copy your heroes.

00:22:17.420 --> 00:22:21.580
The people you love, the people you're inspired
by, the people you want to be.

00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:26.750
The songwriter Nick Lowe he say, "You start
out by rewriting your heroes catalog."

00:22:26.750 --> 00:22:32.370
Now, and the other important thing about who
to copy from.

00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:36.770
You don't just steal from one of your heroes
you steal from all of them.

00:22:36.770 --> 00:22:42.650
The playwright Wilson Mizner he said, "If
you copy from one author its plagiarism.

00:22:42.650 --> 00:22:46.070
If you copy from many it's research."

00:22:46.070 --> 00:22:51.500
And the cartoonist Gary Panter has said something
very similar he says, "If you have one person

00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.820
you're influenced by everyone will say you're
the next whoever.

00:22:55.820 --> 00:23:02.170
But if you rip off 100 people everyone will
say you're so original."

00:23:02.170 --> 00:23:04.260
What to copy is a little bit trickier.

00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:08.950
You don't just want to steal someone's style,
you want to steal the thinking behind the

00:23:08.950 --> 00:23:10.080
style.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.770
You don't want to just steal the code, you
want to steal the thinking behind the code.

00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:19.600
And you don't want to look like your heroes
you actually want to see like your heroes.

00:23:19.600 --> 00:23:24.799
The reason to copy your heroes and their style
is so you might somehow get a glimpse inside

00:23:24.799 --> 00:23:26.290
their minds.

00:23:26.290 --> 00:23:27.780
That's which you really want.

00:23:27.780 --> 00:23:30.880
To internalize their way of looking at the
world.

00:23:30.880 --> 00:23:35.610
If you just mimic the surface of somebody's
work without understanding where they were

00:23:35.610 --> 00:23:40.559
coming from your work will never be any more
than a knockoff.

00:23:40.559 --> 00:23:41.559
T.S.

00:23:41.559 --> 00:23:42.660
Eliot said it best.

00:23:42.660 --> 00:23:44.710
He said, "Poets steal."

00:23:44.710 --> 00:23:52.190
He said, "Bad poets deface what they take
and good poets make it into something better

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:53.890
or at least something different."

00:23:53.890 --> 00:23:59.100
I'm actually going to end off with a quote
from Francis Ford Coppola.

00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:02.340
He said, "We want you to take from us.

00:24:02.340 --> 00:24:07.490
We want you at first to steal from us because
you can't steal.

00:24:07.490 --> 00:24:12.429
You will take what we give you and you will
put it in your own voice and that's how you

00:24:12.429 --> 00:24:14.280
will find your voice.

00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:15.890
And that's how you begin.

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:19.580
And one day someone will steal from you."

00:24:19.580 --> 00:24:22.620
And that's the beginning of "Steal Like an
Artist."

00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:24.920
Thank you.

00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:32.990
[Applause]
So does anyone have any questions?

00:24:32.990 --> 00:24:33.990
If you can.

00:24:33.990 --> 00:24:36.470
Yeah, just hope up to the mike 'cause we're
recording.

00:24:36.470 --> 00:24:43.840
&gt;&gt;male #1: Did you have this idea before you
ran into the issue or the people coming to

00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.590
you telling you that someone had already done
your newsprint idea?

00:24:47.590 --> 00:24:51.440
Or was this something that was before, after?

00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:52.440
How did you get this idea?

00:24:52.440 --> 00:24:56.020
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah, that's a great, that's
a great question.

00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.120
I think, you know I think the idea of influence
was kind of on my mind.

00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:04.170
Especially 'cause I was actually taking writing
from someone else and turning it into something

00:25:04.170 --> 00:25:05.450
new.

00:25:05.450 --> 00:25:08.610
But this really came out of.

00:25:08.610 --> 00:25:14.550
I am a meticulous, not a meticulous, I'm a
voracious quote collector.

00:25:14.550 --> 00:25:19.300
And I was shocked by how many of my favorite
artists.

00:25:19.300 --> 00:25:23.670
Woody Allen, you know not even artists.

00:25:23.670 --> 00:25:27.970
Someone like Steve Jobs or I even heard the
basketball player Kobe Bryant.

00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:32.500
All of these folks would admit that they stole
their moves.

00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:34.070
They stole their ideas.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:37.350
And that they actually used that word steal.

00:25:37.350 --> 00:25:43.040
And so this whole idea of stealing like an
artist actually came out of collecting those

00:25:43.040 --> 00:25:44.040
quotes.

00:25:44.040 --> 00:25:49.160
And I started this series of blog quotes called
"25 quotes to help you steal like an artist."

00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.620
And that's actually where the gem of the idea
started.

00:25:52.620 --> 00:25:56.470
And then there's been some really brilliant
writing on the subject.

00:25:56.470 --> 00:26:00.650
I remember reading Jonathan Lethem's "The
Ecstasy of Influence."

00:26:00.650 --> 00:26:04.070
It was a plagiarism in Harpers.

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:09.740
Where he actually took, he made an essay on
plagiarism out of plagiarized passages from

00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:10.860
other writers.

00:26:10.860 --> 00:26:17.280
And there's a really great video series called
"Everything is a Remix" by Kirby Ferguson

00:26:17.280 --> 00:26:19.470
where Kirby talks about a lot of this stuff.

00:26:19.470 --> 00:26:23.610
And I've actually had the pleasure of doing
a panel with Kirby and we've become friends.

00:26:23.610 --> 00:26:28.820
So there's just all, this has always been.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:31.580
This has always been in the air.

00:26:31.580 --> 00:26:35.250
There is just something about it kind of coming
to a head now.

00:26:35.250 --> 00:26:36.750
You know culturally.

00:26:36.750 --> 00:26:42.510
But yeah it definitely came out of a combination
of quote collecting and then kind of responding

00:26:42.510 --> 00:26:47.500
to the you know accusations that people would
make about my work.

00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:52.240
And how I actually felt about that work 'cause
I had to make a decision very early on.

00:26:52.240 --> 00:26:58.070
Do I continue to do this work even though
it's similar to something someone's done 40

00:26:58.070 --> 00:27:00.580
years ago or do I keep, do I keep going?

00:27:00.580 --> 00:27:06.400
Do I keep pushing myself to transform the
work into something new?

00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.919
Like I found myself wanting to write.

00:27:08.919 --> 00:27:11.940
You know I like to write poems that people
actually want to read.

00:27:11.940 --> 00:27:15.530
So like when I think about William Burroughs
you know sometimes I have trouble with his

00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:16.530
stuff.

00:27:16.530 --> 00:27:21.010
And I think like what makes, I want to take
this avant-garde technique and actually make

00:27:21.010 --> 00:27:23.440
a poem that like a grandma would want to read.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:24.950
You know so it's.

00:27:24.950 --> 00:27:25.950
That's the name of the game.

00:27:25.950 --> 00:27:29.930
You know you kind of like know your history
and you know what people have done before

00:27:29.930 --> 00:27:33.140
and then you figure out the void to fill.

00:27:33.140 --> 00:27:40.580
Are there any other questions?

00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:51.030
&gt;&gt;male #2: At what point have you thought
that presenting a show or presenting something

00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:53.670
becomes a shtick more so than it becomes art?

00:27:53.670 --> 00:27:57.970
In other words, the idea of spontaneity I
think you know writers block and this concept

00:27:57.970 --> 00:28:02.440
that you just, the epiphany has to happen
and it has to flow from there.

00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:07.110
But actually artists who then are able to
continue to make art because they've established

00:28:07.110 --> 00:28:12.600
careers have to get to a point often times
where they are presenting in public scenarios.

00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.950
And there's a certain commercial intersection
there.

00:28:14.950 --> 00:28:15.950
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah.

00:28:15.950 --> 00:28:21.080
&gt;&gt;male #2: So one time when kind of my spontaneous
virginity was lost is I was working the entertainment

00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:24.860
industry and I happened to see Lenny Kravitz
perform multiple times.

00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.460
And the way in which he would interact with
the audience at first seemed like he was completely

00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.470
spontaneous.

00:28:29.470 --> 00:28:34.309
And then after seeing him four times over
the course of a year you know there were variations

00:28:34.309 --> 00:28:37.180
of that, but essentially he had a shtick much
like a lead.

00:28:37.180 --> 00:28:40.150
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah
&gt;&gt;male #2: And at first it was kind of an

00:28:40.150 --> 00:28:41.150
affront.

00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.450
And then I realize there's nothing wrong with
that because it actually comes from something

00:28:43.450 --> 00:28:44.450
that he believes in.

00:28:44.450 --> 00:28:50.429
But for so long I played music for a while,
it was the idea of the spontaneity was so

00:28:50.429 --> 00:28:51.429
key.

00:28:51.429 --> 00:28:54.590
The idea artistry
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah.

00:28:54.590 --> 00:28:58.299
You know spontaneity, it's a personality thing
to.

00:28:58.299 --> 00:29:09.100
I mean I am someone who doing the same presentation
over and over is ridiculously hard for me.

00:29:09.100 --> 00:29:14.940
And I have to constantly remind myself every
time I give a talk that you know the audience

00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:16.890
hasn't heard this before.

00:29:16.890 --> 00:29:21.560
But there's something about a book tour in
particular that makes you start really loathing

00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560
yourself.

00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:27.460
I mean you really, nothing makes you more
conscious of yourself than being like photographed

00:29:27.460 --> 00:29:36.280
and then like filmed and then having to listen
to your own voice every night you know.

00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:43.809
But I think what you said was really cool
is that like as long as it comes from a place

00:29:43.809 --> 00:29:45.760
of something you really believe in.

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.010
'Cause I really do believe in the stuff you
know.

00:29:48.010 --> 00:29:51.650
This isn't just like something that I've researched
that I've seen the Zeitgeist.

00:29:51.650 --> 00:29:54.120
Like this all comes out of my private practice.

00:29:54.120 --> 00:29:59.100
And like I said this is something I wish I
would've heard when I was younger you know.

00:29:59.100 --> 00:30:02.270
So I think there are moments when you can
capture spontaneity.

00:30:02.270 --> 00:30:08.210
I mean especially in like book tour situations
that's what a Q&amp;A is for.

00:30:08.210 --> 00:30:10.430
Because you just never know what people are
gonna ask.

00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:12.320
And that's actually a really fun part for
me.

00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:13.929
Like that's when I get kind of jazzed.

00:30:13.929 --> 00:30:17.220
Because I love, much like.

00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.320
That's why I find the Internet so wonderful.

00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:23.799
'Cause like as an artist I mean.

00:30:23.799 --> 00:30:29.200
As a writer in particular the cool thing about
the Internet is that readers become writers

00:30:29.200 --> 00:30:31.720
because they read your stuff and they write
back to you.

00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.930
And then you become the reader.

00:30:32.930 --> 00:30:36.799
And there's this kind of like back-and-forth
that keeps happening.

00:30:36.799 --> 00:30:38.760
That's actually the kind of spontaneity.

00:30:38.760 --> 00:30:41.270
I never know what kind of e-mail someone is
gonna send me.

00:30:41.270 --> 00:30:43.679
I never know what someone is gonna tweet at
me.

00:30:43.679 --> 00:30:47.630
So that keeps things like really interesting
for me.

00:30:47.630 --> 00:30:57.419
&gt;&gt;male #3: Are there projects you're working
on now or planning to start that you can talk

00:30:57.419 --> 00:30:58.919
about yet?

00:30:58.919 --> 00:31:02.280
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah.

00:31:02.280 --> 00:31:09.929
So the last, the penultimate chapter in my
book has a section called "Marry well."

00:31:09.929 --> 00:31:13.090
And when I was a young.

00:31:13.090 --> 00:31:17.460
When I was a younger artist, I consider myself
still young.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:24.630
But when I was a younger artist a lot of my
favorite artists were actually pretty miserable

00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:26.299
human beings.

00:31:26.299 --> 00:31:32.240
And not particularly good fathers or good
husbands.

00:31:32.240 --> 00:31:36.610
And it's always been a personal, now this
is a personal belief of mine.

00:31:36.610 --> 00:31:45.539
Is that the world needs more, the world needs
better human beings more than it needs great

00:31:45.539 --> 00:31:46.539
artists.

00:31:46.539 --> 00:31:51.490
And I think that a human being's responsibility
first is to be a good human being and then

00:31:51.490 --> 00:31:53.830
you worry about being a good artist.

00:31:53.830 --> 00:32:01.680
So along that theme there's a section in the
penultimate chapter called "Marry well."

00:32:01.680 --> 00:32:06.630
And I've been married for about five years
and I love my wife and she's a collaborator.

00:32:06.630 --> 00:32:10.530
And she's, I run all my ideas through her
first.

00:32:10.530 --> 00:32:14.330
So actually really want to do a book on creativity
and marriage.

00:32:14.330 --> 00:32:16.740
And thinking about marriage as a creative
collaboration.

00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.600
So I think that's what's next for me.

00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.600
But we'll see what happens.

00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:20.600
Any other questions?

00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:21.600
&gt;&gt;female #1: Hi.

00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:35.210
First of all I wanted to say thank you for
coming I really enjoyed the time and it's

00:32:35.210 --> 00:32:36.210
really inspirational.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.250
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Oh thanks for having me, this
is a blast.

00:32:38.250 --> 00:32:45.100
I mean you know it's, this is what I love
to do so thanks so much for having me here.

00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:50.530
&gt;&gt;female #1: I really like the idea that you
mention about just copying other people and

00:32:50.530 --> 00:32:54.770
using it as a starting point for creating
your own work.

00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:58.510
But it seems like that's kind of the first
step and then after that you still need to

00:32:58.510 --> 00:33:01.610
build a career up to that and break into a
market that's really in high demand right

00:33:01.610 --> 00:33:02.610
now.

00:33:02.610 --> 00:33:07.020
So what advice would you give for someone
trying to break into that kind of market.

00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.810
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah
So you are absolutely right.

00:33:11.810 --> 00:33:14.920
Copying is the starting point.

00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.690
If you'll allow me, I'll use a basketball
metaphor.

00:33:18.690 --> 00:33:21.990
So Kobe Bryant, he talks about.

00:33:21.990 --> 00:33:27.360
Kobe Bryant is a really interesting basketball
player because he's one of the first generations

00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:32.230
that could actually watch tapes of other basketball
players playing.

00:33:32.230 --> 00:33:34.500
And they had like highlight reels and stuff.

00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:39.049
So Kobe Bryant talks about how he would copy.

00:33:39.049 --> 00:33:43.440
He would watch these heroes of his and then
he would remember their moves.

00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:46.620
And that when he got on the court he would
try to copy the moves.

00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:52.070
But what he found was that he didn't have
the same body type as a lot of these guys.

00:33:52.070 --> 00:33:55.720
And he didn't have the same teammates in the
same context.

00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.550
So what he had to do was adapt those moves
into something that was actually his own.

00:34:01.550 --> 00:34:08.129
Now what I think copying does for us is for
one thing it shows us our shortcomings.

00:34:08.129 --> 00:34:10.559
Like 'cause you always fall short of your
heroes.

00:34:10.559 --> 00:34:15.480
But what's interesting is the shortcoming
is almost what you're really good at.

00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:18.269
Like that thing that you are not.

00:34:18.269 --> 00:34:22.849
The thing that you don't quite attain by copying
your heroes, it's almost because you are built

00:34:22.849 --> 00:34:26.579
this other way and you need to figure out
what your move is.

00:34:26.579 --> 00:34:32.060
So I actually think the best thing to do is
to survey.

00:34:32.060 --> 00:34:33.609
Is to do exactly what you said.

00:34:33.609 --> 00:34:36.589
It's to, use survey the history of your discipline.

00:34:36.589 --> 00:34:38.749
You survey what people are doing.

00:34:38.749 --> 00:34:43.019
And then you figure out, there's a couple
of ways to make your own mark.

00:34:43.019 --> 00:34:49.109
Like I think one thing to do is just to think
about what your heroes didn't make.

00:34:49.109 --> 00:34:53.569
What did they not get to that you could get
to?

00:34:53.569 --> 00:34:58.170
What if you got four of your heroes in a room
and they collaborated on something, what would

00:34:58.170 --> 00:34:59.170
it look like?

00:34:59.170 --> 00:35:01.880
Like what would they make you know?

00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:08.269
And there is also, what if you took what your
hero did and stuck it in another discipline

00:35:08.269 --> 00:35:09.549
like another context?

00:35:09.549 --> 00:35:13.460
Like what would Andy Warhol code?

00:35:13.460 --> 00:35:17.819
What would Stephen King paint?

00:35:17.819 --> 00:35:25.069
You know so there's all kinds of like little,
I call them like little game, idea games.

00:35:25.069 --> 00:35:29.329
Like little idea generator games that you
can play.

00:35:29.329 --> 00:35:32.339
I don't know if you've ever seen the movie
"The Player".

00:35:32.339 --> 00:35:35.920
But it's about Hollywood and that everyone
in that movie is like, "It's like Citizen

00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:38.270
Kane meets Jaws".

00:35:38.270 --> 00:35:41.400
And they have these like kind of a combinations
of ideas.

00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:46.210
But I actually think that can be really helpful
for your own creative work if you can be like.

00:35:46.210 --> 00:35:50.920
Like for me personally I was like well my
work I wanted to be, not that it's like this

00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.779
but I want it to be like if Kurt Vonnegut
in and Linda Barry hung out in southern Ohio

00:35:57.779 --> 00:35:58.920
and wrote a book.

00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.479
You know or something like that.

00:36:00.479 --> 00:36:04.269
And I play those idea games and I think like
what would that look like?

00:36:04.269 --> 00:36:09.420
And I go and make that thing you know.

00:36:09.420 --> 00:36:12.579
Any other questions?

00:36:12.579 --> 00:36:16.819
Cool.
&gt;&gt;male #4: So I definitely really liked the

00:36:16.819 --> 00:36:22.869
message that you have about really taking
the time to you know figure out what you enjoy

00:36:22.869 --> 00:36:24.130
and what you're passionate about.

00:36:24.130 --> 00:36:28.599
The thing though is that we get so caught
up in our own daily lives in short term that

00:36:28.599 --> 00:36:33.319
it seems like it takes a lot of discipline
to really think beyond the narrow boundaries

00:36:33.319 --> 00:36:35.349
of your daily life.

00:36:35.349 --> 00:36:39.651
So what are some techniques that you have
to force yourself to make the time?

00:36:39.651 --> 00:36:41.280
Do you schedule some time on like Saturday
morning?

00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.280
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Yeah.

00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.029
&gt;&gt;male #4: Like what you make yourself go
to a certain place?

00:36:44.029 --> 00:36:46.770
&gt;&gt;Austin Kleon: Well man you really nailed
it.

00:36:46.770 --> 00:36:47.779
It's about time.

00:36:47.779 --> 00:36:50.589
And I actually have a chapter in the book
called "Be boring."

00:36:50.589 --> 00:36:54.569
And people hate that when they first hear
it because their like wait, be boring like

00:36:54.569 --> 00:36:56.390
that's not how you're creative.

00:36:56.390 --> 00:37:02.099
But I've actually found that time management
for me personally has been the most important

00:37:02.099 --> 00:37:07.140
thing as far as like doing the thinking and
getting the work done.

00:37:07.140 --> 00:37:11.309
Because like I've worked day jobs my whole
life up until this point.

00:37:11.309 --> 00:37:15.190
And I wrote my first book on my commute to
and from work.

00:37:15.190 --> 00:37:17.950
And in the basement on my lunch break.

00:37:17.950 --> 00:37:20.910
That's when I wrote "Newspaper Blackout".

00:37:20.910 --> 00:37:24.349
I actually, and this book I wrote when I was
a copywriter.

00:37:24.349 --> 00:37:28.849
I actually recommend everybody's got different
times when they're more creative.

00:37:28.849 --> 00:37:30.259
Like some people are night people.

00:37:30.259 --> 00:37:35.559
Some, I don't know anyone who's an afternoon
person but some people are morning people.

00:37:35.559 --> 00:37:40.559
I actually recommend to young folks who have
day jobs, but they have like passion projects

00:37:40.559 --> 00:37:41.910
that they want to work on.

00:37:41.910 --> 00:37:48.730
I say if you can swing it, become a morning
person because you wake up early and you sit

00:37:48.730 --> 00:37:52.469
down and you get a good hour or an hour and
a half in.

00:37:52.469 --> 00:37:56.940
And then when you go to your day job you've
already got that out of the way.

00:37:56.940 --> 00:38:02.089
They can't take that out of you, you know
'cause it takes a lot of energy to do good

00:38:02.089 --> 00:38:03.089
work.

00:38:03.089 --> 00:38:07.730
And I'm sure employers don't like it when
I say this but you know I think if you can

00:38:07.730 --> 00:38:13.089
get the work you want to be doing, you really
want to be doing out of the way in the morning.

00:38:13.089 --> 00:38:16.359
Then you know they can't take it from you
for the rest of the day.

00:38:16.359 --> 00:38:17.690
So that's my advice.

00:38:17.690 --> 00:38:19.480
You just schedule that time you know.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:21.190
You just have to be real.

00:38:21.190 --> 00:38:27.119
That's the cool thing is like if you schedule
a time and a place that's the only boring

00:38:27.119 --> 00:38:28.140
part about it.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:31.859
Then when you're in that time and your place
you can be as crazy as you want.

00:38:31.859 --> 00:38:35.550
You just have to schedule your craziness.

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:41.369
Well this has been really great and I thank
y'all for having me.

00:38:41.369 --> 00:38:41.420
[applause]
