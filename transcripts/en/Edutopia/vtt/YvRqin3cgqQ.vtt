00:00:08.176 --> 00:00:09.416
&gt;&gt;Man: Go ahead, pull.

00:00:10.426 --> 00:00:11.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In most places,

00:00:11.656 --> 00:00:14.986
the system of American public
education hasn't changed much

00:00:14.986 --> 00:00:16.196
in the past century.

00:00:16.266 --> 00:00:18.096
&gt;&gt;Historical Film Narrator: Here
in this room, the children learn

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:20.266
to read, to write and to figure.

00:00:21.056 --> 00:00:25.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Built on a rigid agrarian
model, it remains immune to reform,

00:00:25.306 --> 00:00:30.266
intact and in decline, ruled by
clocks and bells, while the rest

00:00:30.266 --> 00:00:32.196
of the world changes around it.

00:00:32.436 --> 00:00:34.036
&gt;&gt;Teacher: One through twenty,
are there any questions?

00:00:34.366 --> 00:00:36.156
&gt;&gt;Bruce: Forty percent
of middle class kids

00:00:36.156 --> 00:00:38.896
in America are completely
disengaged from school.

00:00:38.966 --> 00:00:41.066
They even think this is so
boring, they have no use

00:00:41.066 --> 00:00:42.026
for anything going on there.

00:00:42.026 --> 00:00:43.956
It's really criminal in a sense.

00:00:43.956 --> 00:00:48.116
We have this wonderful, exciting
world that we could expose them to.

00:00:48.116 --> 00:00:50.816
And instead of that, we're
saying, "Well, you can't get there

00:00:50.816 --> 00:00:53.216
until you memorize all these
facts, and then maybe when you get

00:00:53.216 --> 00:00:58.016
out of college, you can
do something that's fun."

00:00:58.016 --> 00:01:01.576
&gt;&gt;George: We've come to a crossroads
in American education, as to whether

00:01:01.576 --> 00:01:05.586
or not we can carry the current
structure of this educational system

00:01:05.926 --> 00:01:09.026
through this century, and I
think there's compelling evidence

00:01:09.026 --> 00:01:11.196
to suggest that we can't do that.

00:01:11.196 --> 00:01:17.476
We cannot hamstring education by
the structure of the school day.

00:01:18.376 --> 00:01:21.106
&gt;&gt;Narrator: While there is
no one size fits all remedy

00:01:21.106 --> 00:01:23.656
to the limitations of the
current educational structure,

00:01:23.916 --> 00:01:26.866
many promising efforts are
underway across the country

00:01:27.116 --> 00:01:31.036
that herald a new day for learning,
a fresh approach to the pursuit

00:01:31.036 --> 00:01:34.936
of knowledge and the use of
resources beyond old constraints

00:01:35.396 --> 00:01:39.666
of time and place.

00:01:41.346 --> 00:01:43.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There is an
extraordinary community center

00:01:43.496 --> 00:01:44.886
in the heart of New York City.

00:01:45.736 --> 00:01:49.156
It offers a complete range of
medical services from dental

00:01:49.356 --> 00:01:55.056
and medical checkups, to
mental health counseling.

00:01:55.676 --> 00:02:01.996
There are adult education classes,
and computer training courses,

00:02:02.446 --> 00:02:05.486
a basketball program
and a bicycle shop,

00:02:06.206 --> 00:02:11.476
a dance company and
a string ensemble.

00:02:11.786 --> 00:02:15.896
Those are just a few of the
activities offered after school

00:02:15.896 --> 00:02:20.856
at I.S. 218, a public intermediate
school, designed from the beginning

00:02:21.016 --> 00:02:23.286
to meet the needs of
the entire community.

00:02:24.116 --> 00:02:26.856
&gt;&gt;Jane: When I first came to this
school, I noticed two things.

00:02:27.296 --> 00:02:29.286
I noticed that the
children seemed happy,

00:02:29.646 --> 00:02:32.426
and I noticed that there were
a lot of extra adults around,

00:02:32.786 --> 00:02:35.086
and I wanted to know
what was happening here

00:02:35.086 --> 00:02:37.646
and how we could make it
happen in more places.

00:02:37.646 --> 00:02:39.976
&gt;&gt;You wanna spell this one first?

00:02:40.056 --> 00:02:44.136
&gt;&gt;Narrator: I.S. 218 is open 6
days a week from 7 in the morning

00:02:44.136 --> 00:02:46.506
to 9 at night all year long.

00:02:47.366 --> 00:02:50.136
It's the product of a partnership
between the New York City Board

00:02:50.136 --> 00:02:54.116
of Education and the Children's
Aid Society, which pays for

00:02:54.116 --> 00:02:57.276
and administers the
extracurricular programs.

00:02:58.226 --> 00:03:00.786
&gt;&gt;Man: The next thing is the planning
for the extended day program.

00:03:00.866 --> 00:03:01.536
Next year, how--

00:03:01.536 --> 00:03:03.436
&gt;&gt;Rosa: There has to be
definitely an openness

00:03:03.436 --> 00:03:05.396
about the things that we both bring.

00:03:05.716 --> 00:03:06.576
There's an understanding

00:03:07.036 --> 00:03:09.736
of the principles experienced
as an educator.

00:03:10.026 --> 00:03:12.536
There's an understanding of my
experience as a social worker,

00:03:12.696 --> 00:03:14.336
and how do the two combine?

00:03:16.266 --> 00:03:16.996
&gt;&gt;Man: No, you did good.

00:03:16.996 --> 00:03:17.376
That was good.

00:03:17.376 --> 00:03:21.486
The way you're doing it is okay.

00:03:22.046 --> 00:03:23.076
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Open up, find wild ginger.

00:03:23.536 --> 00:03:25.976
It's on page 59.

00:03:26.046 --> 00:03:26.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In Minneapolis,

00:03:26.506 --> 00:03:29.106
the natural environment
is a living biology lab

00:03:29.106 --> 00:03:32.986
for various community service
projects, conducted at all hours

00:03:32.986 --> 00:03:35.426
by students in the school
of environmental studies.

00:03:35.926 --> 00:03:39.136
&gt;&gt;Dan: Well, the kids go out and do
a chemical analysis of the water.

00:03:39.566 --> 00:03:42.076
They also will write
a technical paper

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:45.026
and then the present their
findings to the water commissioners

00:03:45.026 --> 00:03:49.466
from the local cities, and those
people actually will be assessing the

00:03:49.466 --> 00:03:50.056
student work.

00:03:50.356 --> 00:03:52.566
And what we find is it
really raises the bar

00:03:52.566 --> 00:03:54.036
for kids and their performance.

00:03:54.426 --> 00:03:58.276
And what we also find is, kids tend
to remember what they've learned

00:03:58.556 --> 00:04:01.576
down the road, because they
put so much effort into it,

00:04:01.576 --> 00:04:04.826
and they work with other students
to create a high end product.

00:04:05.556 --> 00:04:08.086
&gt;&gt;Could use one more.

00:04:08.086 --> 00:04:11.226
&gt;&gt;One more.

00:04:11.226 --> 00:04:11.746
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:04:14.106 --> 00:04:17.976
&gt;&gt;Girl: Fire ribs, chicken
sandwich, they're really good.

00:04:18.046 --> 00:04:20.056
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Oakland,
California's Fremont High School,

00:04:20.406 --> 00:04:22.736
students solved a lunchtime
truancy problem

00:04:22.806 --> 00:04:24.776
by opening a student-run food cart.

00:04:24.776 --> 00:04:28.966
As part of an after school
club, they surveyed other needs

00:04:28.966 --> 00:04:31.776
in their community, and developed
businesses to address them,

00:04:31.776 --> 00:04:34.256
such as a tax preparation service.

00:04:35.046 --> 00:04:36.946
&gt;&gt;Student: At line
thirty-six and thirty-seven?

00:04:37.046 --> 00:04:40.306
&gt;&gt;Narrator: They also responded to
a district call for new school ideas

00:04:40.556 --> 00:04:43.916
and ended up designing a new
school curriculum based on their

00:04:43.916 --> 00:04:46.806
after school program,
which is operating today.

00:04:46.806 --> 00:04:50.566
&gt;&gt;Nidya: Our experience made us
wanna go to school, work real hard,

00:04:50.846 --> 00:04:53.286
do more project based
learning, community service.

00:04:53.706 --> 00:04:58.826
And so we said, "Why can't
everybody learn this way?"

00:04:58.826 --> 00:05:08.826
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Clarence Wells spends two
days a week rebuilding racing cars.

00:05:09.916 --> 00:05:13.276
Evelyn Sanchez spends her
Tuesdays and Thursdays working

00:05:13.276 --> 00:05:14.546
at a veterinary hospital.

00:05:15.336 --> 00:05:18.486
And Chandelle Wilson helps
run a nonprofit arts center.

00:05:19.256 --> 00:05:24.046
These aren't part time, after school
jobs, but school day internships

00:05:24.126 --> 00:05:27.146
that allow students to pursue
their individual passions.

00:05:27.416 --> 00:05:29.666
&gt;&gt;Student: I shot it with
thirty-five millimeter.

00:05:30.576 --> 00:05:32.926
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Real world learning
situations are at the core

00:05:32.926 --> 00:05:36.246
of the curriculum of big picture
schools, which operate at more

00:05:36.246 --> 00:05:38.256
than thirty-five sites
across the country.

00:05:38.256 --> 00:05:41.216
&gt;&gt;Elena: I think it's better for
the kids, 'cause they have more

00:05:41.216 --> 00:05:45.796
of a track to follow, and she knows
now that you have to keep your grades

00:05:45.796 --> 00:05:48.506
up from ninth grade
on, even before that.

00:05:48.506 --> 00:05:50.606
They don't just look at your
last year, where when we were

00:05:50.606 --> 00:05:55.306
in high school, it was more like,
oh, just goof off and do whatever,

00:05:55.306 --> 00:05:57.826
and then towards the end,
you know, pick it up.

00:05:57.826 --> 00:06:00.656
&gt;&gt;Evelyn: I really like being
here on Tuesdays and Thursdays.

00:06:00.656 --> 00:06:02.386
I even come on the
weekends and I get paid.

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:04.316
I want to pursue veterinary.

00:06:04.446 --> 00:06:05.626
That's what I want to do in future.

00:06:05.626 --> 00:06:07.926
I wanna hopefully become a doctor.

00:06:13.076 --> 00:06:14.176
&gt;&gt;Did you turn in that assignment?

00:06:14.496 --> 00:06:14.816
&gt;&gt;Yeah.

00:06:14.816 --> 00:06:14.936
&gt;&gt;Me too.

00:06:16.116 --> 00:06:17.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Thanks to
a unique partnership

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:19.496
between the San Francisco
school district

00:06:19.496 --> 00:06:21.446
and the local architectural
foundation,

00:06:21.816 --> 00:06:24.306
some students spend mornings
in traditional classes

00:06:24.906 --> 00:06:27.086
and afternoons working
as interns at some

00:06:27.086 --> 00:06:29.386
of the top architectural
firms in the city.

00:06:29.906 --> 00:06:32.686
&gt;&gt;Man: We did a walkthrough at the
base of clock tower to find out--

00:06:32.686 --> 00:06:34.826
&gt;&gt;Justin: I'm pretty much
an assistant architect,

00:06:35.046 --> 00:06:38.636
like I get to see everything
an architect has to do,

00:06:38.636 --> 00:06:40.756
has to go through, has to deal with,

00:06:40.756 --> 00:06:43.106
and it definitely gives
you a motivation.

00:06:43.106 --> 00:06:44.226
You're doing something different.

00:06:44.746 --> 00:06:46.426
I go there and I just learn tons.

00:06:46.846 --> 00:06:51.206
&gt;&gt;Man: We can verify our drawing and
actually fill in the missing parts.

00:06:51.366 --> 00:06:54.736
&gt;&gt;Frank: What we've targeted are
students who have not done well

00:06:54.736 --> 00:06:58.756
in school and we want them to finish
and we want to give them a reason

00:06:58.756 --> 00:07:02.066
for finishing, and hopefully
along the way, for them to see

00:07:02.066 --> 00:07:03.596
that there's career opportunities

00:07:03.596 --> 00:07:05.856
for them beyond getting
their high school diploma.

00:07:06.106 --> 00:07:08.186
&gt;&gt;Woman: You don't have
to scrap the design,

00:07:08.186 --> 00:07:09.666
'cause the design is beautiful.

00:07:09.816 --> 00:07:12.546
&gt;&gt;Will: We know this works first
by the reaction from the students.

00:07:12.776 --> 00:07:15.406
We get feedback from the
mentors on the growth

00:07:15.406 --> 00:07:18.736
that they see the students working
in their firms, and we're starting

00:07:18.736 --> 00:07:20.736
to get feedback from test scores.

00:07:20.736 --> 00:07:23.196
We're starting to see that the
students are having a higher success

00:07:23.196 --> 00:07:26.526
rate in high school, because they go
back to their high schools energized.

00:07:27.366 --> 00:07:28.936
&gt;&gt;Mikalynn: You get to
learn about architecture.

00:07:29.266 --> 00:07:32.746
You get to sharpen up your
skills on like algebra,

00:07:32.746 --> 00:07:38.976
and like so I always joke around
with my mom and like say, you know,

00:07:38.976 --> 00:07:42.696
"I'm gonna design your
house one day."

00:07:43.076 --> 00:07:46.576
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The Clark County school
system of Las Vegas is a microcosm

00:07:46.576 --> 00:07:47.926
of the country's challenges.

00:07:48.496 --> 00:07:50.796
&gt;&gt;Carlos: Our demographics
have changed radically.

00:07:51.016 --> 00:07:52.266
You know, we went from a district

00:07:52.266 --> 00:07:55.736
that was seventy-two percent
Caucasian, ten, fifteen years ago,

00:07:55.956 --> 00:07:59.586
to now, a district that's only
forty-eight percent Caucasian

00:07:59.746 --> 00:08:01.486
and the minorities are the majority.

00:08:02.216 --> 00:08:04.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The fastest
growing system in America,

00:08:05.076 --> 00:08:08.836
Clark County faces a booming
non-English speaking population,

00:08:08.836 --> 00:08:12.926
a high high school drop out
rate, and a facilities crunch.

00:08:13.056 --> 00:08:17.486
But by putting student needs
at the center of the process,

00:08:17.486 --> 00:08:19.676
the district has developed
some innovative solutions,

00:08:20.416 --> 00:08:21.496
including the creation

00:08:21.496 --> 00:08:24.056
of an extensive distance
learning curriculum.

00:08:24.286 --> 00:08:27.726
&gt;&gt;Mike: I'm able to interact on a
live white board with the students.

00:08:27.996 --> 00:08:30.086
We speak through the mic.

00:08:30.086 --> 00:08:31.736
&gt;&gt;If you look at your work and see

00:08:31.736 --> 00:08:33.966
if you should have been adding
instead of multiplying them.

00:08:34.446 --> 00:08:36.756
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There's also a
unique high school that caters

00:08:36.756 --> 00:08:38.276
to the needs of students who work.

00:08:38.566 --> 00:08:41.516
&gt;&gt;Kay: We have kids that work
early morning construction.

00:08:41.756 --> 00:08:44.636
We have kids that work
late night at casinos.

00:08:44.926 --> 00:08:49.316
And so the high school that goes from
two in the afternoon to nine o'clock

00:08:49.316 --> 00:08:51.486
in the evening is perfect
for these kids.

00:08:51.486 --> 00:08:53.296
&gt;&gt;Joseph: It's a different
environment.

00:08:53.426 --> 00:08:55.476
The teachers are like a
lot more understanding.

00:08:55.756 --> 00:08:56.646
They help you out more.

00:08:56.706 --> 00:08:59.206
It's a good school to come
to, because they like,

00:08:59.326 --> 00:09:00.766
they know your needs,
they know you're working,

00:09:00.886 --> 00:09:02.656
so they really reward you for that.

00:09:03.516 --> 00:09:06.576
&gt;&gt;Teacher: [speaks Spanish].

00:09:07.076 --> 00:09:09.016
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At this Clark
County elementary school,

00:09:09.016 --> 00:09:12.326
English language skills are
reinforced throughout the day

00:09:12.616 --> 00:09:13.766
by technology.

00:09:13.866 --> 00:09:15.976
&gt;&gt;Find the balloon T, T.

00:09:16.126 --> 00:09:16.936
&gt;&gt;Narrator: And mentorships.

00:09:17.126 --> 00:09:19.976
&gt;&gt;Mentor: What is that sound?

00:09:20.056 --> 00:09:22.186
&gt;&gt;Narrator: There are also
literacy programs after school

00:09:22.386 --> 00:09:25.996
for preschool children
and their parents.

00:09:26.686 --> 00:09:28.976
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Number one,
John is a student.

00:09:29.156 --> 00:09:31.606
&gt;&gt;Carol: We knew we had to meet
the needs of the entire family,

00:09:32.156 --> 00:09:34.906
so by working with the middle school
across the street, the parents go

00:09:34.906 --> 00:09:37.246
across the street and get
English lessons, which is going

00:09:37.246 --> 00:09:40.386
to enhance their future,
in terms of job potential.

00:09:41.196 --> 00:09:43.546
And all the older siblings
they have many choices.

00:09:43.586 --> 00:09:46.896
Like right now, we have
intramural soccer going on.

00:09:47.306 --> 00:09:48.266
We have ballet.

00:09:50.146 --> 00:09:50.986
&gt;&gt;Woman: And one...

00:09:51.126 --> 00:09:53.606
&gt;&gt;Carol: We have line dancing.

00:09:55.106 --> 00:09:57.256
&gt;&gt;Leah: The biggest thing,
building self esteem.

00:09:57.766 --> 00:10:00.186
They didn't think they'd
be able to perform.

00:10:00.336 --> 00:10:02.136
First of all, they couldn't
even do the first dance.

00:10:02.206 --> 00:10:03.126
They said, "We can't do this."

00:10:03.506 --> 00:10:04.596
Now they know three dances.

00:10:04.656 --> 00:10:08.176
We're working on the cowboy hip-hop.

00:10:09.086 --> 00:10:12.386
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Successful programs like
these require extraordinary vision,

00:10:12.386 --> 00:10:15.756
creativity and commitment,
and are not easily maintained.

00:10:16.056 --> 00:10:16.936
&gt;&gt;Student: What exactly
can we get done?

00:10:17.046 --> 00:10:20.866
&gt;&gt;Narrator: But they hold the promise
of a new day for learning in America.

00:10:21.476 --> 00:10:22.916
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You want to
put your GPSs up this way.

00:10:23.566 --> 00:10:25.956
&gt;&gt;Milton: This new day for
learning will require the design

00:10:25.956 --> 00:10:28.376
of an entirely new learning
system for our students.

00:10:28.926 --> 00:10:32.016
We'll need not just schools, but
also many other organizations,

00:10:32.336 --> 00:10:35.076
youth serving organizations,
businesses and universities,

00:10:35.456 --> 00:10:39.206
even museums and libraries,
to rethink how children learn,

00:10:39.286 --> 00:10:41.626
where they learn and
when they can learn.

00:10:41.626 --> 00:10:44.566
And we do know this can happen,
because we've seen many examples

00:10:44.566 --> 00:10:47.826
of how this is happening
around the nation.

00:10:48.046 --> 00:10:50.746
&gt;&gt;Jane: The needs are always greater
than the resources that we can bring

00:10:50.796 --> 00:10:54.386
to the table, even collectively,
but I think that we have found

00:10:54.716 --> 00:10:57.396
that if you have the word
"yes" written in your heart,

00:10:57.536 --> 00:11:00.866
you can make almost anything happen.

00:11:01.346 --> 00:11:01.596
&gt;&gt;All: All right!

00:11:06.106 --> 00:11:07.956
