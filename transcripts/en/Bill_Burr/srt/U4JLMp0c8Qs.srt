1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:03,900
Hey,
what's going on it's Bill Burr.

2
00:00:03,901 --> 00:00:08,850
It's time for the Monday morning
podcast for Monday, April 11th.

3
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:09,790
April.

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,250
I'm off 2016 what's going on?

5
00:00:14,680 --> 00:00:19,320
I'll worry. Ah, it's a, it's
Sunday night to Sunday evening.

6
00:00:19,321 --> 00:00:21,780
I'm in the house all by myself.
Uh,

7
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:26,610
the lovely Nia had some business
meeting or some shit she had to go to.

8
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,570
Um, it's show business.
I know what you saying.

9
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,920
You guys all live in the normal
world. You're thinking like, wait,

10
00:00:31,921 --> 00:00:36,921
my wife says she's got a business meeting
on a Sunday night at fucking surpass a

11
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:39,330
certain hour. That means
she's out there. Somebody

12
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,940
I know.
That's what you think.

13
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:48,720
But I'm in show business so it's totally
normal for them to go out their way.

14
00:00:48,721 --> 00:00:50,640
What the fuck happened to
the high head over here?

15
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:54,390
I told you to get me a little fucking
practice set up then what the fuck is

16
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,940
be clear was playing it when
I wasn't here anyways. Anyway,

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:03,240
she um, yeah, so she's out.

18
00:01:03,241 --> 00:01:07,410
So I'm going to try to knock this out
cause I gotta be at work on Monday for

19
00:01:07,411 --> 00:01:08,490
something.
For some reason,

20
00:01:08,491 --> 00:01:11,910
I still can't say whether
what it is or what's going on.

21
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:16,740
Hopefully. Uh, so we, uh, you know
what it is, you know what it is?

22
00:01:16,741 --> 00:01:18,990
Maybe you don't know what it is.
Maybe you don't listen to every week,

23
00:01:18,991 --> 00:01:23,160
but you know what it is. So I gotta
be at work on Monday and, uh, oh,

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:25,020
Billy fucking,
uh,

25
00:01:25,050 --> 00:01:29,970
clean living ever since
I got back from Canada.

26
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:34,680
Oh, Canada. You bunch of
freeze and cuts. I got,

27
00:01:35,050 --> 00:01:38,160
I just got back from there. And, uh,

28
00:01:38,161 --> 00:01:41,190
I kind of realized that when I
go on the road with the Fellas,

29
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,300
we act like we're on some sort of
bachelor party. I don't know what it is,

30
00:01:45,301 --> 00:01:50,160
minus the fucking who is everything
else. Uh, we basically, uh,

31
00:01:50,180 --> 00:01:53,580
you know, we booze and we smoked cigars
in that thing and it's just, you know,

32
00:01:53,581 --> 00:01:58,080
it takes a lot out of me
and I got a bunch of Shit I gotta do,

33
00:01:58,081 --> 00:02:02,400
so I kind of need to be clearheaded
as opposed to the usual, you know,

34
00:02:02,401 --> 00:02:05,280
usually when I got nothing going on in
my life. I mean, I can fucking, you know,

35
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,630
we're going to have a few,
right.

36
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:11,490
I can wake up the next morning like
fucking eggs or something. Right.

37
00:02:11,491 --> 00:02:15,900
I can be in that mindset, but,
uh, as of right now, I can't, so,

38
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:19,440
um, I have not done
anything. Haven't done shit.

39
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:21,600
I even fucking haven't drank.

40
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:25,080
I haven't smoked a meeting pretty good.

41
00:02:26,890 --> 00:02:29,790
Um, even laying off the internet
porn, I mean it's just fucking over.

42
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:33,600
I actually got this time magazine
there was about Internet porn in Houma.

43
00:02:33,601 --> 00:02:38,280
I was like fucking people up, you
know, especially like kids, you know,

44
00:02:38,281 --> 00:02:42,600
when they first like just the shit that
the Schmooze kitten hope this shit you

45
00:02:42,601 --> 00:02:47,010
can see on the fucking Internet.
I can't believe nobody stepped in.

46
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:50,400
I'm not saying somebody
should step in, but, um,

47
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:52,231
you know,

48
00:02:52,231 --> 00:02:56,040
I gotta tell you if they knew what the
fuck the Internet was going to be when it

49
00:02:56,041 --> 00:02:59,800
was, whenever Al Gore was
inventing it in the 80s,

50
00:03:03,310 --> 00:03:08,110
um, I'll never said that. I
said that. I was, uh, I was
involved in the email chain,

51
00:03:08,111 --> 00:03:10,720
whatever the fuck he said.
That fucking guy.

52
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:12,900
Yeah.

53
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:16,440
Number one is campaign was over men when
he was dancing around and all sweaty

54
00:03:16,441 --> 00:03:17,180
and all that shit,

55
00:03:17,180 --> 00:03:21,480
and he just looked like he was so
fucking relieved that it was over. Um,

56
00:03:21,481 --> 00:03:24,030
what a thing that goes
through running for president.

57
00:03:24,031 --> 00:03:27,390
I just saw a clip of Hillary Clinton.
I have not been paying attention at all,

58
00:03:27,391 --> 00:03:29,880
but Jesus Christ,
what the fuck happened at her?

59
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:34,950
She looks like Earl fucking waiver.
She's like Earl weaver.

60
00:03:34,951 --> 00:03:39,780
She was doing something right. She was
standing at some black church, right?

61
00:03:39,781 --> 00:03:42,090
Baptist church.
I'm going to assume you know,

62
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,460
I don't think it was a
Jewish synagogue there.

63
00:03:44,461 --> 00:03:48,400
Whatever the fuck they could temple.
She's in this green shoot.

64
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,600
She's just like yelling and all
this shit she was going to do.

65
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:56,430
That's the only time a politician goes
near the black community is when they're

66
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:59,670
running. They fucking,
they swing by the church.

67
00:03:59,670 --> 00:04:04,200
They make a whole bunch of promises
and then they get in the fucking limo.

68
00:04:04,380 --> 00:04:08,520
They go, let's get the fuck outta
here. Right. Fuck. Gotta Dodge.

69
00:04:09,410 --> 00:04:13,980
And they go over, they do a town meeting.
Talk to all the lunch pail Louise.

70
00:04:14,070 --> 00:04:17,730
Right. Does any, if they've says even
those people left in this country,

71
00:04:17,731 --> 00:04:18,990
if you fucking make anything,

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,610
and they get over there and they say
roll up their sleeves, that's whether,

73
00:04:23,611 --> 00:04:26,460
you know, they're talking to the work
and man, they take off their sport coat,

74
00:04:26,461 --> 00:04:29,280
they roll up their sleeves,
you know,

75
00:04:29,281 --> 00:04:31,860
like they're going to build something
rather than just go out there and say the

76
00:04:31,861 --> 00:04:33,090
exact same bullshit.

77
00:04:33,091 --> 00:04:37,110
They just said the Baptist church with
more of a fucking a lunch pail swing,

78
00:04:37,111 --> 00:04:40,830
do it right. And the whole
fucking thing, it's just gross.

79
00:04:40,831 --> 00:04:43,560
I don't know anybody sits there
and watch that shit, but um,

80
00:04:45,390 --> 00:04:48,930
the latest thing that I've
become fascinated with is
I completely leave whatever

81
00:04:48,931 --> 00:04:52,080
the fuck I was just talking about. I'll
come back to it. The clean living thing,

82
00:04:52,380 --> 00:04:56,700
who wants to listen about clean living?
It's the most boring shit ever, you know?

83
00:04:57,450 --> 00:04:58,760
Anyways.
Um,

84
00:04:59,640 --> 00:04:59,970
yeah.

85
00:04:59,970 --> 00:05:04,170
I become fascinated with
how super rich people,

86
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:05,020
yeah.

87
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:06,550
Avoid paying taxes.

88
00:05:07,620 --> 00:05:08,210
Yeah.

89
00:05:08,210 --> 00:05:12,470
Just fucking fascinating. It's one
of those things, you know, it's like,

90
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:17,110
if you got to respect it,
I'll just, certain level, it's
just the brilliance of it.

91
00:05:17,410 --> 00:05:21,130
And then there's a certain level of balls
that that takes because you're fucking

92
00:05:21,131 --> 00:05:25,840
with your freedom anytime you fucking
with taxes, you know what I mean?

93
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:30,790
Fucking with the government.
Anytime you've, you're doing
that, I mean, you know,

94
00:05:30,791 --> 00:05:33,190
why is it that, I don't know. What
the fuck is that a federal thing?

95
00:05:33,191 --> 00:05:35,720
I guess if you're not paying your
federal income tax yet, Bill,

96
00:05:35,850 --> 00:05:38,260
that would probably be a federal crime.
I Dunno.

97
00:05:38,530 --> 00:05:40,060
I always say you got
to cross state borders.

98
00:05:40,270 --> 00:05:43,810
Do you have to like not pay taxes and
then leave your state before it becomes

99
00:05:43,811 --> 00:05:47,820
federal? I don't know. I don't
know these things. But anyways, um,

100
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:53,170
just the balls that it takes and the,
uh,

101
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,750
I dunno, I don't like people physically,
other people, that type of crime.

102
00:05:59,751 --> 00:06:03,110
But when there's something
like robbing banks

103
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,560
or tax evasion or even a good
old fashioned fucking scam,

104
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:13,430
if there's like a,

105
00:06:14,060 --> 00:06:18,530
like an amazing level of thought behind
it on some level, you got to respect it,

106
00:06:18,590 --> 00:06:21,440
I think. You know what I mean? Like,

107
00:06:21,441 --> 00:06:23,990
I remember a long time ago
there was some fucking guy,

108
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:28,400
he figured out how to rob parking meters

109
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:32,900
and they were allegedly,
it was impossible to do so.

110
00:06:32,901 --> 00:06:37,820
This guy figured out how to fucking do
it. It's amazing. And he did this shit.

111
00:06:37,821 --> 00:06:41,210
This is back in like the eighties Isam
Shit. This guy figured out how to do it.

112
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,170
So it was way,
way,

113
00:06:42,171 --> 00:06:46,580
way easier to not have everybody
breathing down your fucking throat.

114
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,170
You know, people will be
having eggs watching you
fucking Robin a parking meter.

115
00:06:51,290 --> 00:06:54,320
They didn't have a fucking
smart phone on them.

116
00:06:55,460 --> 00:06:57,770
They'd just be sitting there going,
this fucking got couches.

117
00:06:58,750 --> 00:07:03,340
Is that Guy Robin and parking meter.
Oh his shit.

118
00:07:03,370 --> 00:07:07,350
The fuck.
Just say that.

119
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,540
That was it.
That's all that fucking happen.

120
00:07:10,750 --> 00:07:15,010
Rather than some dose shit in there
filming you and you're arrested before you

121
00:07:15,011 --> 00:07:19,300
even get home. All right. And then
the fucking local newscasters,

122
00:07:19,301 --> 00:07:23,830
they always got to do some sort of
fucking bad pun. You know what I mean?

123
00:07:25,180 --> 00:07:30,160
I'll tell you, this guy's life is
freedom is now going to change. You know,

124
00:07:30,161 --> 00:07:33,160
they do that some other, they
get away with that. And I'm
like, fucking newspapers.

125
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:35,320
Like they can have the
biggest fucking puns ever.

126
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,370
And everybody thinks it's
great, you know? I don't know.

127
00:07:40,070 --> 00:07:43,350
I can't even think of one right now.
Yeah. But, uh, whatever, you know,

128
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,550
you sit at home and you think about,

129
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:47,860
you said he a fucking cubicle
instead of doing your goddamn work,

130
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,780
you think of one. So anyways, this fucking
guy figured out how to do this shit. Um,

131
00:07:53,950 --> 00:07:56,650
and of course the parking meter
gods were beside themselves,

132
00:07:56,860 --> 00:07:59,110
you know what I mean?
It was like one of those Scifi movies.

133
00:08:00,420 --> 00:08:03,610
We're like the titanic movie led,
not even God can sick it.

134
00:08:03,860 --> 00:08:04,361
That's what they were like,

135
00:08:04,361 --> 00:08:09,160
not even God could get the
fucking quarters out of this
meter, this meter. Right.

136
00:08:09,490 --> 00:08:09,520
That's,

137
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,000
they were talking all kinds of shifts of
this fucking guy figured out how to do

138
00:08:13,001 --> 00:08:15,850
it. And you'd think you'd like
Ai, whatever, man, you throw,

139
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:17,290
what the fuck you gonna do with that?

140
00:08:17,291 --> 00:08:20,980
We'll do this fucking meters
all over the city. So this guy,

141
00:08:20,981 --> 00:08:24,190
anytime you wanted to drink, if he wanted
a fucking stand with you and he goes,

142
00:08:24,191 --> 00:08:25,990
Guy,
he had it perfect.

143
00:08:27,610 --> 00:08:32,080
It was like his own ATM machine before
ATM machines, he just walk up, bank bank,

144
00:08:32,081 --> 00:08:35,350
boom. He had a sack of fucking
quarters. You go down to the bank,

145
00:08:35,351 --> 00:08:39,580
you go and kind of get one southern, the
rolly fucking things there, right? Yeah,

146
00:08:39,581 --> 00:08:43,000
sure. They don't give a shit.
Nobody gave a fuck back then.

147
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:44,440
Nobody was paying attention.

148
00:08:44,441 --> 00:08:46,960
They were trying to pay attention
but not not to that type of shit.

149
00:08:47,230 --> 00:08:52,090
So this guy would roll the fucking
quarters, you know, rose enough quarters.

150
00:08:52,091 --> 00:08:54,670
Next thing you know,
he gets himself out.

151
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,180
How the fuck you get all those
quarters down to a car dealership?

152
00:08:57,181 --> 00:08:58,350
I have no fucking idea.

153
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:02,550
Although I talked to some drug dealers
about how they fucking, um, or a guy,

154
00:09:02,551 --> 00:09:04,290
a new drug dealers.
Let's be honest here at bill,

155
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,350
let's not act like that news guy saying
that you were in the war and then you

156
00:09:07,450 --> 00:09:08,283
were in a chopper,

157
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:11,880
some shit next to the chopper and you
didn't really fucking see it. Okay.

158
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:16,320
You took a fucking helicopter tour
one time, you weren't even in Iraq,

159
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,230
whatever the fuck he said, I don't
pay attention to shit. So anyways,

160
00:09:19,231 --> 00:09:23,250
I was talking to this guy and basically
how back in the day when drug dealers

161
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:26,790
were still driving around and flashy cars,
cause when I heard nowadays they,

162
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:30,480
they don't even want to track
that level of attention. Um,

163
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:32,280
how it used to be was anything,

164
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:37,890
any cash deal that was over 10 grand
grand had to be fucking reported.

165
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:43,440
So what these drug dealers would do was
they would go out and they buy a car

166
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:47,970
worth nine grand for cash and then they
drive it around for like a fucking week.

167
00:09:47,971 --> 00:09:52,050
And then they traded in for a car was
16 grant, maybe get seven for theirs.

168
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:54,720
And then they throw another
fucking night at the other car.

169
00:09:54,730 --> 00:09:57,910
Now they got a $16,000 car.
He drive around for a little bit.

170
00:09:57,970 --> 00:10:02,190
You fucking trade it in a $23,000 car.
They give you fifth,

171
00:10:02,191 --> 00:10:04,050
whatever and so on and so forth

172
00:10:05,610 --> 00:10:09,840
til you trade your way all the way up
to whatever fucking car you want it. Um,

173
00:10:11,310 --> 00:10:13,530
it just, I don't know, I just look at that
shit. It's like, I mean, that's not the,

174
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,330
the deepest thing, but that's the way
my brain would work. I'd be like, Whoa,

175
00:10:18,390 --> 00:10:22,500
you're so good. I drive a piece of shit.
Then what's the point of dealing drugs?

176
00:10:23,910 --> 00:10:26,220
Right? Or I just say, fuck it.

177
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:30,450
I'm buying a Ferrari and I'm going to
drive it until they catch me fucking three

178
00:10:30,451 --> 00:10:34,440
weeks later. Um, by the way,

179
00:10:34,441 --> 00:10:36,570
the Ferrari I like is
the Ferrari California.

180
00:10:36,571 --> 00:10:39,890
That's the old man won the fucking
gt, the grand touring one. Right?

181
00:10:39,910 --> 00:10:41,940
I don't even ride around
with some Batmobile.

182
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,160
Just give me one that's shaped like a
fucking Jaguar from back in the day,

183
00:10:47,190 --> 00:10:49,740
you know,
or maybe a Toyota supra,

184
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:55,500
those fucking things from the 80s. I
remember this guy loaned me his, well,

185
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:59,290
he used my truck to move and I brand and
I'd beat the shit out of his car and he

186
00:10:59,291 --> 00:11:00,510
beat the fuck out of my truck.

187
00:11:00,510 --> 00:11:04,170
And we both got our cars back and he's
smelling rubber and I'm seeing all kinds

188
00:11:04,171 --> 00:11:07,800
of scratches all over my truck and we
just, Eh, it's kind of a fair deal. Right?

189
00:11:08,350 --> 00:11:11,310
And then we both got arrested for
drinking and drive it months later.

190
00:11:11,520 --> 00:11:15,000
But that's a completely different story.
I know I'm all over the map.

191
00:11:15,001 --> 00:11:17,460
I'm doing this late night and I
don't want to be doing it right now,

192
00:11:17,461 --> 00:11:21,870
but I got shit to do in the
morning. So anyways, is fucking guy,

193
00:11:23,340 --> 00:11:26,940
you know,
if he had half a fucking brain,

194
00:11:26,941 --> 00:11:30,420
what you do is you keep your day job,
right?

195
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:33,570
Keep your fucking day job and then
you know, for anything miscellaneous,

196
00:11:33,571 --> 00:11:36,240
she gets to go to the parking meters,
right?

197
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:39,390
And what you do is you start
storing up on the quarters.

198
00:11:40,050 --> 00:11:41,970
Then every once in awhile,
right? You just start,

199
00:11:41,971 --> 00:11:45,150
you start washing the money
with you fucking can. I know
what you do. You fucking,

200
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:48,030
you go into stores and stuff. You
gave, who gives a fuck? Right?

201
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,470
You just use it to get yourself a
better TV. But what does this dope do?

202
00:11:53,560 --> 00:11:57,490
He gets fucking greedy. I don't even
remember how fucking story goes.

203
00:11:57,491 --> 00:12:00,700
All I know is he just started hitting
every fucking goddamn parking meter around

204
00:12:00,910 --> 00:12:04,060
and next thing you know he's sitting on
like a fucking $2 million in quarters

205
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:08,440
and he ended up getting busted. But
there was a part of it. I liked the guy,

206
00:12:09,220 --> 00:12:11,560
you know.
So anyways,

207
00:12:11,561 --> 00:12:16,150
this gets me to the super rich on how
you know all that shit about the Panama

208
00:12:16,180 --> 00:12:17,650
papers and all that type of stuff.

209
00:12:17,651 --> 00:12:22,651
I was talking to another friend of mine
who's a fucking law and I was like,

210
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,180
how does that work? Like how do you
get your money out of the country?

211
00:12:28,660 --> 00:12:32,410
And then once it's out of the country,
how do you make sure nobody steals it?

212
00:12:33,070 --> 00:12:37,540
Like what happened to Johnny
Depp's character and blow
and then once you have it

213
00:12:37,541 --> 00:12:38,261
out of the country,

214
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,350
how did he get it back in without
just getting taxed all over again?

215
00:12:41,351 --> 00:12:46,090
A busted and he said, basically this is
it. He broke the whole fucking thing down.

216
00:12:46,200 --> 00:12:49,810
All right. Or as far as I
know, he broken aspect of it,

217
00:12:50,020 --> 00:12:52,640
then I know all you guys are sitting
there right now going, Oh gee, she,

218
00:12:52,641 --> 00:12:53,830
she's going to try to explain to him,

219
00:12:53,860 --> 00:12:56,830
I'm going to try to explain some shit
that was just explained to me and I don't

220
00:12:56,831 --> 00:12:58,270
really know what the
fuck I'm talking about.

221
00:12:58,271 --> 00:13:02,170
So let's get rid of one myth right out
of the gate. I remember long time ago,

222
00:13:02,171 --> 00:13:05,680
a friend of mine had a fucking landscaping
business and he already had a truck

223
00:13:05,681 --> 00:13:08,980
and he went out and he bought
this giant fucking, you know,

224
00:13:08,981 --> 00:13:11,830
one of those things with the dual wheels
on the back and this fucking giant

225
00:13:12,190 --> 00:13:16,390
Bedell who you put cattle in it,
right? And I was like, holy fuck man,

226
00:13:16,391 --> 00:13:18,460
how much is that thing cost?
And you know, it's like the 80s,

227
00:13:18,461 --> 00:13:22,420
it costs like 25 grand, which was a lot
of fucking money back then, right? Um,

228
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:26,170
for a truck, you know, it's like
10 grand more than you pay the 25,

229
00:13:26,171 --> 00:13:29,860
30 grand or some shit. Right? And I was
like, Holy Shit, man, you can afford that.

230
00:13:29,861 --> 00:13:34,410
And he was like, yeah, it's a write off.
That's what a lot of dope say. And they,

231
00:13:34,411 --> 00:13:36,680
they, it is a write off,
but what they think is,

232
00:13:36,681 --> 00:13:40,150
is that they can write
$30,000 off of their taxes,

233
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:44,590
which you can't.
What you can do is you can write off,

234
00:13:45,610 --> 00:13:50,610
it's a write off as far as that 30 grand
that you just spent in that truck is

235
00:13:51,010 --> 00:13:53,290
untakeable all right,

236
00:13:53,320 --> 00:13:56,680
it's sitting in whatever you made
that money you made 30 grand.

237
00:13:56,680 --> 00:14:00,010
If it's just sitting there and you
don't put it back into play as far as

238
00:14:00,011 --> 00:14:01,510
reinvesting into your business,

239
00:14:01,840 --> 00:14:05,050
the government will tax you at
the end of the year. You know,

240
00:14:05,051 --> 00:14:09,370
on that 30 grand and let's say
you're in like a fucking I whatever,

241
00:14:09,580 --> 00:14:12,300
20% tax bracket that you'd,

242
00:14:12,301 --> 00:14:16,150
you'd have to give the government
fucking six grant, right?

243
00:14:17,380 --> 00:14:20,800
That's it. So the people
more on Stink, oh,

244
00:14:20,801 --> 00:14:23,230
I get to write 33 in the end of the year,

245
00:14:23,231 --> 00:14:26,470
if I owed 40 grand in taxes
and I bought a $30,000 truck,

246
00:14:26,471 --> 00:14:30,100
I get to take $30,000 off on my taxes.
You wouldn't,

247
00:14:30,101 --> 00:14:34,390
you just be able to knock off six grand,
right? You're not even knocking it off.

248
00:14:34,960 --> 00:14:37,090
You just not getting taxed on that.
Does that make sense?

249
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:40,660
Probably doesn't cause I explained it.
So anyways,

250
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:42,100
when you have your own business,

251
00:14:43,690 --> 00:14:48,130
what you're trying to do is you're
trying to come up with as many fucking

252
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:52,400
writeoffs as you possibly can.
Many his expenses,

253
00:14:52,401 --> 00:14:57,130
everything you possibly can to
lower your, your basic, your,

254
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:01,310
uh, whatever your income as far
as what is going to be taxable.

255
00:15:01,311 --> 00:15:04,610
So say you made fucking a hundred grand.
All right?

256
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:06,530
You grossed a hundred grand.

257
00:15:07,070 --> 00:15:11,450
The net is what you're left with after
your expenses you try to fucking come up

258
00:15:11,451 --> 00:15:16,451
with is many Goddam expenses as you can
to get that hundred grand is far down to

259
00:15:17,371 --> 00:15:20,180
zero as possible.

260
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:23,810
Ideally you wouldn't want to pay any
fucking taxes as far as these people look.

261
00:15:23,811 --> 00:15:28,040
But the bottom line is you can only do
it so much and if you write off too much,

262
00:15:28,250 --> 00:15:32,390
the IRS is going to show up and be
like, what's this fucking, you know,

263
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,380
60 grand for fucking cheeseburgers,
blah, blah, blah. You tried to write off,

264
00:15:36,381 --> 00:15:39,500
you need going to get busted.
All right?

265
00:15:40,580 --> 00:15:42,620
So what these fucking
super rich people do is,

266
00:15:42,621 --> 00:15:45,350
the first thing they do is they get the
fucking money out of the, out of the,

267
00:15:45,740 --> 00:15:46,640
out of the country

268
00:15:48,210 --> 00:15:51,330
because the IRS is jurisdiction
doesn't go beyond the borders.

269
00:15:51,330 --> 00:15:54,990
So what they do is they just create a
company that doesn't exist. It just,

270
00:15:54,991 --> 00:15:59,160
it's just on paper, right?
To say you make $100 million,

271
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:00,330
right?

272
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:03,930
What you do is you go to a country that
doesn't give a shit about America and

273
00:16:04,110 --> 00:16:07,920
let you use it as a tax shelter. You just
come up with some incorporated thing,

274
00:16:08,460 --> 00:16:11,160
like who gives a fuck ink,
right?

275
00:16:11,610 --> 00:16:14,760
And then you just have that
company bill your company,

276
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,940
a consulting fee for $100
million or whatever the whatever.

277
00:16:19,160 --> 00:16:21,600
I've up to a hundred billion,
30 40 50 whatever.

278
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,270
You don't want to pay taxes
on whatever you, whatever.

279
00:16:25,080 --> 00:16:29,190
And then you write a check to
that company that doesn't exist.

280
00:16:29,191 --> 00:16:32,130
That's really you.
And then you send it out.

281
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:34,020
So now it's out of the fucking country.

282
00:16:35,380 --> 00:16:37,990
And then what they do is
they open up like 10 other,

283
00:16:37,991 --> 00:16:39,340
these fucking shell companies,

284
00:16:39,341 --> 00:16:41,740
and they have those other
companies build the first company.

285
00:16:41,741 --> 00:16:44,010
And then the third one bills the
second one, the fourth 1 billion.

286
00:16:44,040 --> 00:16:48,540
It's just got the monies fucking gone.
Now the IRS could come at you, bill,

287
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:52,660
what the fuck did you pay somebody?
$100 million consulting fee.

288
00:16:52,661 --> 00:16:54,100
And then you're telling me,

289
00:16:55,080 --> 00:16:55,320
yeah,

290
00:16:55,320 --> 00:17:00,250
you paid somebody
$100 billion as a consulting fee.

291
00:17:00,310 --> 00:17:03,190
And then you just look at him and go,
yes.

292
00:17:05,410 --> 00:17:09,230
And evidently there's nothing they can
fucking do about it. So then I was at,

293
00:17:09,240 --> 00:17:12,840
I go, all right, so now it's out
of the country and then this,

294
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:17,650
it's in this other country. How the fuck
do you protect it? And they, and he goes,

295
00:17:17,651 --> 00:17:18,010
well,

296
00:17:18,010 --> 00:17:22,690
you those countries where these tax
shelters that they in on the scab,

297
00:17:23,470 --> 00:17:27,770
so you just kicked them 10% of the
hundred million, you give him 10 years,

298
00:17:27,940 --> 00:17:30,370
fucking whatever you can negotiate.
We'll just make it easy.

299
00:17:30,371 --> 00:17:33,190
Here's 10 million bucks.
So what I, you know,

300
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:37,870
I'll give you 10 million rather than
given the government fucking 50 55 60

301
00:17:37,870 --> 00:17:42,110
million at 100 million, I'm still
fucking up 45 million. All right.

302
00:17:42,970 --> 00:17:46,720
So then I was like, all right, so
now how do you get the money back?

303
00:17:47,470 --> 00:17:49,760
Because if you know,
you bring the money back is to the bank,

304
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:52,500
they're going to consider
that earned income. Like
where the fuck did you get it?

305
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,750
And this guy was like,
they,

306
00:17:55,080 --> 00:17:58,020
they bring it back into the
country in the form of a loan.

307
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,970
Loans aren't taxable, right?
Like if you get a fucking loan,

308
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:04,310
cause you're already paying interest on
it and everything, they don't tax you.

309
00:18:04,311 --> 00:18:06,200
So they just bring it back
in the form of a loan.

310
00:18:06,201 --> 00:18:09,470
Whatever the fuck you want to do.
I want to buy a $10 million house.

311
00:18:09,471 --> 00:18:13,040
You have this Shell company that's 10
times removed from the one that you paid

312
00:18:13,170 --> 00:18:14,750
for the consulting fee.
Right.

313
00:18:14,751 --> 00:18:17,780
And they can't follow the
paper trail because it's in
a different country. Right.

314
00:18:18,140 --> 00:18:20,800
You just bring it back into the
country in the form of alone loan.

315
00:18:22,590 --> 00:18:23,240
MMM.

316
00:18:23,240 --> 00:18:26,600
And then you go buy a fucking
house and I guess, I don't know,

317
00:18:26,610 --> 00:18:30,140
you pretend to make payments on the
loan is forgiven by this shell company.

318
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:32,270
That's still you.
I know.

319
00:18:32,271 --> 00:18:36,860
I just glossed over that and if
anybody has more information on it,

320
00:18:36,861 --> 00:18:40,370
I find it absolutely fascinating.
There's all, there's other ones,

321
00:18:40,371 --> 00:18:44,350
they just pretend that that's
their main business. Um,

322
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,850
that shell companies,
so they just act like it's doing the,

323
00:18:47,780 --> 00:18:49,740
I don't know that that's,

324
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:52,940
that's as far as I can remember that
what he told me and I found that shit

325
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,740
absolutely fucking fascinating
because at the end of the fucking day,

326
00:18:58,760 --> 00:18:59,160
yeah.

327
00:18:59,160 --> 00:19:00,360
As far as what they're doing,

328
00:19:00,390 --> 00:19:02,760
I know they're fucking over
you and me because you know,

329
00:19:02,761 --> 00:19:05,790
the school systems go down the shitter
because they don't have enough money.

330
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:07,800
There's a lot of potholes
is all kinds of stuff.

331
00:19:07,801 --> 00:19:10,100
You can't take care of
your homeless people. Hey,

332
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:14,160
you can't build another gleaming
structure for a fucking sports team.

333
00:19:14,161 --> 00:19:15,060
Whatever the fuck it is.

334
00:19:16,690 --> 00:19:17,523
MMM.

335
00:19:17,580 --> 00:19:22,550
The end of the day is fucked up is that,
is these people who are criminals,

336
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:27,560
they're stealing from other
criminals. As far as my, uh,

337
00:19:27,650 --> 00:19:31,320
conspiracy theory goes to the IRS. It's
just a bunch of fucking crooks anyway.

338
00:19:31,321 --> 00:19:32,154
So I mean they,

339
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:38,110
it's kind of fascinating watching these
two giant powerful entities fuck with

340
00:19:38,331 --> 00:19:40,820
each other. You know, meanwhile,

341
00:19:42,120 --> 00:19:42,953
you know,

342
00:19:43,860 --> 00:19:44,950
I'm in the cross hairs,

343
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:47,550
you're in the cross hairs and
we're all paying Elvis taxes

344
00:19:50,610 --> 00:19:53,810
and it goes Hillary Clinton
screaming and some Baptist churches,

345
00:19:53,820 --> 00:19:56,050
she talking about that
shit because she is,

346
00:19:56,410 --> 00:19:58,290
because when you bring
the fucking money back in,

347
00:19:58,291 --> 00:20:00,510
you just don't bring it in
and go out and buy yourself.

348
00:20:00,511 --> 00:20:04,800
You fucking Ferrari California. What
you do is, I mean, you do do that,

349
00:20:04,801 --> 00:20:05,634
but what else?

350
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:08,880
What's your also do is you walk around
with Nice Wad of cash and you go, oh, hey,

351
00:20:08,881 --> 00:20:11,550
chief of police. Oh, look
at that Birdie over there.

352
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:15,870
And as he looks over your stuff, a fucking
water cash in his pocket, you know,

353
00:20:16,470 --> 00:20:19,170
and then I'll, oh, is it
an election year? Yeah.

354
00:20:19,171 --> 00:20:22,200
Let me get a take 2 million on Trump.

355
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:27,120
Give me 2.5 on Hillary and a fuck it.
Give me 500 grand.

356
00:20:27,210 --> 00:20:28,230
And Bernie Sanders,

357
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:32,010
what do you mean he's not taking any money
from guys like Mike? Oh, is that right?

358
00:20:32,070 --> 00:20:36,630
Oh well, you know, whatever. He
won't get in. And if he does,

359
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:40,740
uh, you know, I'll give 3 million
to one, you know, silence.

360
00:20:41,670 --> 00:20:44,250
That's what the fuck they doing. That's,
and that's how they, they, you know,

361
00:20:45,970 --> 00:20:49,420
I don't, I'm convinced to
that. I'm convinced as far
as like stand up comedy goes,

362
00:20:49,421 --> 00:20:54,421
you know why they're always giving a
shit is because a standup comedians just

363
00:20:55,331 --> 00:20:56,980
organized.
Okay.

364
00:20:57,690 --> 00:21:02,470
And we donated to the campaigns of
people running for the Democratic and

365
00:21:02,560 --> 00:21:05,410
Republican parties.
Right.

366
00:21:05,980 --> 00:21:10,980
And then we bought a little ad time on
CNN and on Fox News and all these major

367
00:21:11,381 --> 00:21:12,520
networks.
If we did that,

368
00:21:12,521 --> 00:21:17,020
you'd never see another comedian getting
in trouble for doing a fucking Caitlyn

369
00:21:17,020 --> 00:21:20,470
Jenner joke
anyways.

370
00:21:20,500 --> 00:21:22,690
If anybody has any more information
on that or they can talk about,

371
00:21:22,730 --> 00:21:27,090
I don't like if it's really
dry, I just like, um,

372
00:21:28,380 --> 00:21:31,270
I'm fascinated with people that do shit
like that. And then they go to bed,

373
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:34,780
no one what the fuck they're doing.
And they gotta be thinking at some point,

374
00:21:36,010 --> 00:21:40,000
like the wolf's gotta be coming to the
door at some point. Hang on one second.

375
00:21:40,001 --> 00:21:40,834
I gotta answer this.

376
00:21:41,660 --> 00:21:42,493
Okay.

377
00:21:42,730 --> 00:21:45,760
All right. So I'm back. Of
course. I completely forget
what the fuck out where I,

378
00:21:45,790 --> 00:21:50,720
I ended off. Um, but what I really
learned when I was, you know,

379
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:54,350
listening to this lawyer telling
me all this shit, um, oh,

380
00:21:54,351 --> 00:21:56,630
I know I say in the balls at
that takes to go to bed at night.

381
00:21:56,710 --> 00:21:57,381
No one at any point.

382
00:21:57,381 --> 00:22:00,200
Like all of a sudden the fucking feds
are gonna kick in your fucking door.

383
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:02,720
But I think that these guys
are like the smarter ones.

384
00:22:03,020 --> 00:22:06,650
And when you watch like American greed,
what I noticed when I watched them,

385
00:22:07,190 --> 00:22:11,060
all of their fuckery was within
the borders of the United States,

386
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:14,990
which you just, I mean, if you, I
guess if you're too dumb to know,

387
00:22:14,991 --> 00:22:18,830
you don't realize you're not going to get
away with it forever. But like once I,

388
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:21,020
um,
after talking to this guy,

389
00:22:22,310 --> 00:22:27,310
it just seems like anybody who just
tries to have their entire illegal entity

390
00:22:27,951 --> 00:22:32,750
within the borders of one country
is, uh, you're just on borrowed time.

391
00:22:33,170 --> 00:22:36,290
So I think when you watch American greed,
what you're really seeing is,

392
00:22:36,300 --> 00:22:40,610
is the hacks of, uh, you know,

393
00:22:40,611 --> 00:22:42,890
you always see these fucking idiots.
They buy a house,

394
00:22:43,190 --> 00:22:45,980
they get all these fucking cars and
they have some strippers come over.

395
00:22:46,010 --> 00:22:49,160
Oh my fucking laptop.
Oh,

396
00:22:49,161 --> 00:22:53,420
that was a laptop hitting hardboard
floors. Come on, come on baby.

397
00:22:53,960 --> 00:22:57,680
Come on. Come around. You're all right.
Hang in there and help us on the wake.

398
00:22:58,990 --> 00:23:00,490
Fuck yeah.

399
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:05,550
Uh, you fucking motherfucker. Steve
Jobs is laughing somewhere right now.

400
00:23:06,780 --> 00:23:09,270
He's laughing at me cause I gotta give
him money and he also knows this can be

401
00:23:09,271 --> 00:23:14,130
another little kids get to
put it together. All right.
And saved it. Saved. Um,

402
00:23:15,540 --> 00:23:16,910
so anyways,
uh,

403
00:23:17,850 --> 00:23:20,850
let's read a little bit of fucking Ad
Shit here before my screen goes dark.

404
00:23:21,490 --> 00:23:22,323
Okay.

405
00:23:22,850 --> 00:23:25,310
Hang on a second. I find
that shit. I find it, um,

406
00:23:25,430 --> 00:23:27,590
I find all that stuff fucking amazing.
It's really,

407
00:23:27,591 --> 00:23:29,840
really interesting if you
just remove yourself from it,

408
00:23:31,020 --> 00:23:32,980
the humanity of it or whatever,
uh,

409
00:23:34,250 --> 00:23:37,580
and all the people that it's affecting
and kids not getting better school books

410
00:23:37,581 --> 00:23:40,100
and shit. If you just look at
the fucking game that's going on,

411
00:23:40,101 --> 00:23:43,160
it's really fucking
interesting. All right. Oh Shit.

412
00:23:44,420 --> 00:23:48,140
We got new here. We've got somebody
new. This is Joe Rogan's company,

413
00:23:48,141 --> 00:23:51,230

414
00:23:51,350 --> 00:23:53,270
Joe Rogan experience podcast.

415
00:23:54,170 --> 00:23:57,080
He might recognize him from a g,
I don't know,

416
00:23:57,081 --> 00:24:01,670
the first 200 UFC pay per views.
Um,

417
00:24:02,900 --> 00:24:04,820
one of the best standup comics
I've ever seen. All right.

418
00:24:04,821 --> 00:24:05,870
Here's this company on it.

419
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,760
On it is a health and wellness company
focused on inspiring peak performance

420
00:24:11,510 --> 00:24:15,650
through unique products and actionable
information. I can already tell you,

421
00:24:15,651 --> 00:24:16,880
this is written to smartly,

422
00:24:16,881 --> 00:24:20,900
so I'm going to fuck this up with strategy
from leading professional athletes

423

and medical practice practitioners on
it has focused on creating earth grown

to then, all right. You Guy.

485

Are you already listing to fucking two
of these? Let's get back to the podcast,

486
00:28:18,850 --> 00:28:23,490
shall we? All right. Um,
oh, Jesus. Oh, Jesus.

487
00:28:23,491 --> 00:28:27,030
I got to bring it up. My
Boston Bruins, unfortunately.

488
00:28:28,940 --> 00:28:33,670
Um, after a big, big win over
the Detroit Redwings, uh,

489
00:28:34,710 --> 00:28:39,180
got beat down by Ottawa, six to one, and
we're out of it. You know, it's funny,

490
00:28:40,060 --> 00:28:43,890
we've beat Detroit the game before
and then because we lost Detroit,

491
00:28:43,891 --> 00:28:44,820
get in and do you know,

492
00:28:44,821 --> 00:28:49,320
that was actually a certain amount of
fucking red wing fence that we're actually

493
00:28:49,321 --> 00:28:52,860
talking shit. The smart ones were
going, hey, thanks for losing.

494
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:57,150
And then the other ones are like,
fucking 26 years in a row.

495
00:28:58,620 --> 00:29:00,810
We've been in the playoffs.
Yeah, it's impressive.

496
00:29:00,811 --> 00:29:04,260
But this year you're backed in
like a bitch. You went in as first.

497
00:29:04,261 --> 00:29:06,090
I don't know what you fuck.
I mean,

498
00:29:06,330 --> 00:29:10,650
because it team that you couldn't even
beat when it count two days before,

499
00:29:11,160 --> 00:29:14,910
you know who fucking manhandled you.
I don't know what you're excited about.

500
00:29:14,911 --> 00:29:19,590
You know, you like the fat chick who
got, you know, fucking asked to the Prom,

501
00:29:20,670 --> 00:29:23,430
you know? Yeah. You all exceeded.
She just wanted to be there.

502
00:29:23,431 --> 00:29:27,030
Who's getting know you there for the
fucking buffet and then you go and home

503
00:29:27,031 --> 00:29:30,240
crying.
That's what I'm predicting for Detroit.

504
00:29:30,390 --> 00:29:34,560
Your makeup's going to be running
by game three of the first series.

505
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:35,401
I'm fucking with you.

506
00:29:35,401 --> 00:29:38,070
I have no hate for anybody
that's in the playoffs this year.

507
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:43,150
I think I'm going to want, and I've
always liked Detroit. Um, tries.

508
00:29:43,151 --> 00:29:46,200
When I was growing up,
they never won shit. Yeah.

509
00:29:46,210 --> 00:29:50,890
Big thing is they had wanted since
1955 with Gordie Howe and um,

510
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,070
they one in the middle
of a 40 year drought, um,

511
00:29:54,220 --> 00:29:57,550
before they got a team
around Eisenman and not man,

512
00:29:57,700 --> 00:29:59,200
those were great times watching hockey.

513
00:29:59,560 --> 00:30:04,510
They fucking avalanche Redwings
fucking rivalry. That was the best.

514
00:30:04,511 --> 00:30:09,020
It was the first time when I lived in
La and the games came home at five and I

515
00:30:09,070 --> 00:30:13,540
totally got back into hockey,
get I was original six. Oh,

516
00:30:13,690 --> 00:30:17,050
is the burst up, sorry.
Book could Yada herself. Um,

517
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:22,560
so this year I think in the east,
uh, I'm gonna, I'm gonna route,

518
00:30:22,570 --> 00:30:27,370
I'm going to root for two fucking teams
this year in the east and the West. Uh,

519
00:30:27,530 --> 00:30:31,930
the, I'm rooting for the capitals to
push through to get to the finals and a,

520
00:30:31,931 --> 00:30:35,560
as much as they like the kings and
the Black Hawks. Just to switch it up,

521
00:30:35,561 --> 00:30:40,000
I'd love to see the Dallas stars or a,
the St Louis Blues,

522
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:44,230
you know, somebody different, you
know, Saint Louis Blues. Who's kidding?

523
00:30:44,231 --> 00:30:47,590
If fans have been waiting for fucking
ever, they have been in the league.

524
00:30:47,591 --> 00:30:51,640
They're part of the expansion
six that came in 1967.

525
00:30:52,490 --> 00:30:56,140
All right.
The NHL was a 16 league.

526
00:30:58,270 --> 00:31:01,090
Um, before that, right
after the depression,

527
00:31:01,091 --> 00:31:03,190
there was a lot of people that I didn't
realize this either. There was a,

528
00:31:03,210 --> 00:31:04,900
there was a bunch of other teams,
not a bunch,

529
00:31:04,901 --> 00:31:08,710
but there was like fleece
for other fucking teams are
something that all folded

530
00:31:08,711 --> 00:31:09,461
after the,
the uh,

531
00:31:09,461 --> 00:31:13,360
the depression and the sixth that survived
and became known as the original six.

532
00:31:14,590 --> 00:31:18,070
Um, so 1967, six teams
came in Kenya and name

533
00:31:20,110 --> 00:31:23,530
off the top of my head. Let's
see, there was the flyers,

534
00:31:24,070 --> 00:31:28,240
the penguins,
the north stars.

535
00:31:29,530 --> 00:31:33,970
Oh, Jesus. The California golden seals.

536
00:31:38,140 --> 00:31:41,110
Ah, man. I used to know this
off top my head. Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait, wait, wait,

537
00:31:41,111 --> 00:31:45,400
wait. Capital's didn't come in
until the early seventies. Fuck.

538
00:31:45,401 --> 00:31:50,350
Make St Louis Blues. Jesus Christ. It
just brought him up. One more. One more.

539
00:31:50,490 --> 00:31:51,730
Was it a Seattle team?

540
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:58,000
Cleveland barons sits with the fucking
golden seals became, didn't they?

541
00:31:58,990 --> 00:32:01,880
Oh, the fucking La kinks. Yeah.

542
00:32:01,940 --> 00:32:04,930
And the La Kings way the fuck out there.

543
00:32:05,350 --> 00:32:09,700
And that was funny when for the Golden
Seals, like folded or to Cleveland,

544
00:32:11,350 --> 00:32:15,520
they went to Cleveland. Just like the
dreams of all the sports fans there.

545
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:18,610
They just fucking died.
A slow, miserable death.

546
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:22,870
And I'm like,
that franchise just died out.

547
00:32:22,930 --> 00:32:27,190
Nobody bought it and went nowhere. It
just went to Cleveland and fucking died.

548
00:32:27,880 --> 00:32:29,470
So for the longest time,

549
00:32:30,790 --> 00:32:35,790
the only game in town I'll fucking west
was the king's every fucking road trip

550
00:32:36,221 --> 00:32:40,670
they had was like at least a three, four
hour fucking Denver didn't have a team.

551
00:32:40,670 --> 00:32:43,880
Vancouver didn't have a team.
Edmonton, Calgary, they had nothing.

552
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:47,990
They were just out there by themselves,
you know,

553
00:32:48,740 --> 00:32:53,740
basically fucking whatever actresses
couldn't bang a Los Angeles Dodgers in La

554
00:32:55,130 --> 00:32:59,210
ramp. That's basically, they got sloppy
thirds. That's what was going on.

555
00:32:59,211 --> 00:33:01,210
So anyways, yeah, we lost. So, uh,

556
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:04,900
congratulations to the flyers
and the fucking Redwings.

557
00:33:05,150 --> 00:33:09,230
There was two spots left in
three teams vying for it. And uh,

558
00:33:09,231 --> 00:33:13,400
we didn't get in and like clockwork,
the day after,

559
00:33:13,401 --> 00:33:17,120
we don't get in.
What Boston Sports Rayer,

560
00:33:17,121 --> 00:33:22,070
who doesn't watch hockey do you think?
Piled on immediately? And as always,

561
00:33:22,071 --> 00:33:24,740
calls for the wrong
head to be chopped off.

562
00:33:25,790 --> 00:33:30,790
Good old Dan Shaughnessy the noodle headed
contem self who doesn't watch hockey?

563
00:33:31,250 --> 00:33:34,220
Doesn't like hockey chimes in.

564
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:37,760
Something's gotta be done.
It's time

565
00:33:39,470 --> 00:33:44,100
based on what Dan, all the hockey.
You never fucking watch. Um, Julian,

566
00:33:44,150 --> 00:33:48,920
this was actually one of his
finest coaching performances
of the year of, I mean,

567
00:33:48,921 --> 00:33:52,340
of his career.
They traded the entire fucking team away.

568
00:33:54,880 --> 00:33:56,570
Basically. They treat they, it was,

569
00:33:57,660 --> 00:33:57,780
yeah,

570
00:33:57,780 --> 00:34:02,690
what they got rid of over the
last few years. Tyler Sagan, um,

571
00:34:04,500 --> 00:34:09,030
Johnny Boyd Shock Douggie fucking
fresh. They're fucking, uh,

572
00:34:09,060 --> 00:34:12,840
Milan. Cheecha was just, I
was like, we got nothing.

573
00:34:13,780 --> 00:34:17,290
We got nothing left. I now
know that Marshawn, we got
Bergie. We still had Shara.

574
00:34:17,610 --> 00:34:21,300
CIARA is older now, but basically, who's
knew anybody fucking watches hockey.

575
00:34:21,301 --> 00:34:23,040
Looked at the Bruins who was like,
you know what?

576
00:34:23,400 --> 00:34:28,400
This is a rebuilding year and all the
way up to like mid March Clo Julian had

577
00:34:30,271 --> 00:34:35,190
this, this rebuilding year
team was a third seat.
Everybody was bunched together.

578
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,790
We hit a bad patch, you know,
went out West tough fucking run.

579
00:34:38,791 --> 00:34:40,260
We lost some games and
next thing you know,

580
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:43,740
we were fighting for the playoff lives
as they say. And we didn't win. I mean,

581
00:34:45,330 --> 00:34:47,730
I mean, I don't know if
you get, I would get,

582
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,010
if anybody's heads going
to get chopped off,

583
00:34:50,250 --> 00:34:54,390
you chop the head off whoever made all
those fucking trades. But you know,

584
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:57,990
the bottom line is the guy who made the
first half of those already got his head

585
00:34:57,991 --> 00:35:00,300
chopped off and then you got,
was it Michael Carneal?

586
00:35:00,440 --> 00:35:03,270
You gotta give this guy a chance,
right?

587
00:35:04,380 --> 00:35:08,110
You can't just go one and done a fucked
up with that be they just kept closed.

588
00:35:08,450 --> 00:35:10,230
Julian a fucking watch
for having the most Vic,

589
00:35:10,260 --> 00:35:12,780
the most wins ever have any Bruins coach.

590
00:35:12,960 --> 00:35:17,700
He got us our first fucking
Stanley Cup in like, what was it?

591
00:35:17,701 --> 00:35:22,170
Almost 40 years and then what? A
couple of years later, he does not,

592
00:35:22,171 --> 00:35:26,910
I coach hockey anymore.
Why is it time Dan?

593
00:35:26,911 --> 00:35:30,240
Shaughnessy
why is it time?

594
00:35:31,590 --> 00:35:33,180
Cause it's too early
in the baseball season.

595
00:35:33,270 --> 00:35:36,420
You got nothing to write about his guys
forever calling for somebodies head.

596
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,590
You know, Dan, you know,

597
00:35:37,591 --> 00:35:40,620
I think it's time for you to do it's
time for you to stop writing about hockey

598
00:35:40,621 --> 00:35:44,190
or maybe watching maybe fucking
five games in the goddamn season.

599
00:35:45,450 --> 00:35:48,360
Unfuckable that guy,
I swear to God at the end of the day,

600
00:35:48,361 --> 00:35:49,770
I think he's from New York City.

601
00:35:49,800 --> 00:35:53,280
The way he just tries to pull apart
fucking teams. It's unbelievable.

602
00:35:54,330 --> 00:35:56,460
You know what I mean?
He's like,

603
00:35:56,461 --> 00:35:59,970
somebody wants a mob guys goumarre that
they ended up having a whack cause she

604
00:35:59,971 --> 00:36:02,850
can't keep her fucking mouth shut now.

605
00:36:03,600 --> 00:36:07,500
Jesus Pillco wheezy on the guy's just
trying to sell some fucking papers. Um,

606
00:36:07,830 --> 00:36:09,840
I don't really hate Dan Shaughnessy.
I don't know the guy,

607
00:36:09,841 --> 00:36:11,580
but I can tell you right now,
uh,

608
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,460
he's one of the few people that
looks less athletic than me

609
00:36:18,600 --> 00:36:19,590
anyways.

610
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:21,130
Yeah.

611
00:36:21,130 --> 00:36:25,270
Any who is I as I was
talking about earlier, um,

612
00:36:25,880 --> 00:36:30,670
I've been doing the whole fucking clean
living thing since I got back from a yet

613
00:36:30,671 --> 00:36:35,360
another lost bachelor party weekend
slash stand updates run with,

614
00:36:35,770 --> 00:36:36,790
uh,
with my buddies there.

615
00:36:38,180 --> 00:36:39,013
MMM.

616
00:36:39,910 --> 00:36:44,600
He and Bart, nick and a, so this
whole week, no booze, no porn,

617
00:36:45,440 --> 00:36:49,910
no cigars, nothing. I got the cigar thing.
I got that thing on, on fucking lockdown.

618
00:36:51,670 --> 00:36:52,503
MMM.

619
00:36:52,890 --> 00:36:55,610
I don't have him in my house.
I think about doing,

620
00:36:55,611 --> 00:36:59,940
I don't think about doing it as much and
I only had one cigar in March and I'm

621
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:03,900
going gonna try to just have
one this month. Although, um,

622
00:37:06,020 --> 00:37:06,261
yeah,
look,

623
00:37:06,261 --> 00:37:09,140
I'm thinking about only having one and
then I'm also thinking about having a

624
00:37:09,141 --> 00:37:10,430
fucking cigar night over here.

625
00:37:10,431 --> 00:37:14,900
I might do that because
I have like fucking,

626
00:37:15,430 --> 00:37:15,890
yeah,

627
00:37:15,890 --> 00:37:20,240
I dunno about 10 cigar friends
and unless you smoke cigars,

628
00:37:20,241 --> 00:37:22,550
you don't know what that means. But
it's just people that call, Hey,

629
00:37:22,551 --> 00:37:24,080
I'm going to smoke. You
want to come by, right.

630
00:37:24,680 --> 00:37:27,740
So all of a sudden I have
10 opportunities a month.

631
00:37:27,741 --> 00:37:31,280
People call me a c'mon man combined smoke
my in smoking the casino you smoked in

632
00:37:31,281 --> 00:37:32,750
like seven, eight, nine, 10 of them.

633
00:37:33,380 --> 00:37:37,820
So I'm going to invite all of them over
to my house the same fucking night and

634
00:37:37,821 --> 00:37:41,630
I'll smoke one cigar with all 10 of them
rather than smoking one each with 10

635
00:37:41,631 --> 00:37:45,590
individuals. How does that math work?
Right? Then I'll create a shell company.

636
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,520
Um,
so anyways,

637
00:37:49,580 --> 00:37:53,000
so I bought this time magazine on watching
Internet porn and I was fucking up

638
00:37:53,001 --> 00:37:54,020
kids. Like they're, you know,

639
00:37:54,050 --> 00:37:56,900
the amount of shit that they see before
they even get their first fucking hand

640
00:37:56,901 --> 00:37:59,300
job. It turns them into like
these fucking sociopath.

641
00:37:59,600 --> 00:38:01,610
And I gotta admit reading
some of the articles,

642
00:38:01,611 --> 00:38:03,950
like I could relate to a lot
of this shit that was going on.

643
00:38:03,951 --> 00:38:08,780
So I'm really just gonna fucking
going to try to stop that cold Turkey.

644
00:38:09,470 --> 00:38:12,380
You know, I got to stop,
look at it. That shit.

645
00:38:14,270 --> 00:38:17,360
Fuck, I'm sorry. See this clean lists.

646
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,420
What clean living does for you at
10 30 at night? I'm fucking Yani.

647
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:25,010
I'm ready to go bed right now.
Get my fucking jam jams and here and here.

648
00:38:25,011 --> 00:38:28,220
I am supposed to be there for you.
You guys are sitting there at work,

649
00:38:28,221 --> 00:38:30,890
the last fucking thing you need.
You probably already had a doughnut.

650
00:38:31,250 --> 00:38:35,920
You're going to sick a sugar crash
here in a minute. And here I am,

651
00:38:35,921 --> 00:38:37,630
young and Anya.
Um,

652
00:38:39,160 --> 00:38:39,993
so

653
00:38:40,950 --> 00:38:43,470
what else can I talk about
here? Oh yeah, clean living.

654
00:38:43,471 --> 00:38:46,770
If you try and have some clean living,
do not watch the Lemmy documentary,

655
00:38:46,771 --> 00:38:48,540
which I just watched for the second time.

656
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:50,713
MMM.

657
00:38:51,070 --> 00:38:52,990
Makes you want to have a couple
of drinks cause you like,

658
00:38:52,991 --> 00:38:57,040
look how long that guy fucking lift
all this shit that he did. You know.

659
00:38:59,250 --> 00:39:03,670
Fuck are y'all good? All
right, 39 minutes in.

660
00:39:03,671 --> 00:39:07,300
I can do the last 21 minutes here
without Yada. Here we go. Here we go.

661
00:39:07,990 --> 00:39:11,200
All right. Um, by the way,

662
00:39:11,201 --> 00:39:13,720
I don't for a people out there,
uh,

663
00:39:13,840 --> 00:39:16,390
you know I mentioned some of the
helicopter shit. I did. I did.

664
00:39:16,391 --> 00:39:17,550
I tell you I finally did that,

665
00:39:17,850 --> 00:39:22,480
that Solo flight that I wanted
to do from long beach and I,

666
00:39:22,481 --> 00:39:26,800
I went through the Bravo airspace with
the planes taking off over here, you know,

667
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:30,040
and lax came right around,
looked at the house,

668
00:39:30,550 --> 00:39:32,860
flew over the fucking house that they,
uh,

669
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:38,730
the Horse's head from godfather right
down sunset over the El Monte and then

670
00:39:38,891 --> 00:39:40,030
back to,
um,

671
00:39:41,060 --> 00:39:43,690
oh I did tell you that cause that's
when they saw the old guy fall off the

672
00:39:43,691 --> 00:39:48,580
fucking scooter. I'm sorry. I thought
I did think that I told you that one.

673
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,440
I was just thinking about
that shit the other day.

674
00:39:50,441 --> 00:39:53,440
Of course my fucking headphones go out.
What they would have fucking, I knew it.

675
00:39:53,441 --> 00:39:57,250
I fucking knew it. I knew
that was going to happen. Um,

676
00:39:58,110 --> 00:39:58,780
yeah.

677
00:39:58,780 --> 00:39:59,531
So anyways,

678
00:39:59,531 --> 00:40:04,510
I was at the comedy store on Saturday
night and I was trying out this, uh,

679
00:40:04,540 --> 00:40:07,270
this new chunk that I've been fucking
with for the last couple of months.

680
00:40:07,330 --> 00:40:12,220
And I finally got it down. I said
it, it's perfect as I could say it.

681
00:40:12,221 --> 00:40:16,330
Of course I didn't, I didn't fucking die.
I didn't tape. Of course I didn't tape.

682
00:40:16,750 --> 00:40:18,550
Why would I take that would've
been the smart thing to do,

683
00:40:18,551 --> 00:40:23,380
but whatever I said it, so I'll
get it, I'll get it back. And um,

684
00:40:24,920 --> 00:40:26,270
I felt fucking great about it.

685
00:40:26,271 --> 00:40:30,710
And then today I got text messages from
two different comedians telling me that

686
00:40:30,711 --> 00:40:33,950
they loved the new shit that I was doing.
It just, I just made my fucking day.

687
00:40:33,951 --> 00:40:36,770
So I'm really excited about,
uh,

688
00:40:37,250 --> 00:40:41,480
getting that shit together because I want
to do another special this year. And,

689
00:40:41,810 --> 00:40:43,820
um,
I got some stuff in my act that's funny,

690
00:40:43,821 --> 00:40:48,530
but I just feel like the topics have been
done before, so I'm gonna try to like,

691
00:40:48,531 --> 00:40:53,440
you know, you know, push that shit to the
wayside. Maybe that'll just be on the,

692
00:40:53,660 --> 00:40:57,350
the, some of those topics.
We'll just be on like the, uh,

693
00:40:58,220 --> 00:41:01,610
when I released the vinyl of
the Madison Square Garden Show,

694
00:41:02,060 --> 00:41:03,560
I'll just keep them on that one.

695
00:41:04,010 --> 00:41:06,710
There'll be some extra jokes that
won't be the same material. I Dunno.

696
00:41:07,400 --> 00:41:10,790
I'm just excited about the,
uh, the next few months,

697
00:41:11,240 --> 00:41:12,950
how that Shit's going
to turn out. But, uh,

698
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:15,260
before I get into the questions this week,
everybody,

699
00:41:15,560 --> 00:41:18,080
I have to give a shout
out to rogue fitness.

700
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:22,160
Whoever gently was listening
to the podcast, I was breaking
their balls. You know,

701
00:41:22,170 --> 00:41:26,330
I'm, I'm making a gym. I'm paying somebody
to build a gym for me up my garage,

702
00:41:26,331 --> 00:41:30,230
a little gym there in the back. And I
got all my shit through rogue fitness.

703
00:41:30,231 --> 00:41:34,400
They just had the best shit out there.
And I was just joking with them that, uh,

704
00:41:34,430 --> 00:41:38,110
you know, how dare you not send me Free
Shit. I didn't even ask him for it.

705
00:41:38,150 --> 00:41:42,140
He just immediately came to the podcast
breaking the fucking balls and they

706
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:43,820
listen to the one,
whether it was me and Nia.

707
00:41:43,850 --> 00:41:46,640
Nia told me to get the
regular looking weights,

708
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,970
just the ones that look like iron
or whatever. And I wanted the,

709
00:41:50,150 --> 00:41:52,640
I wanted the colorful ones and
she thought that they were corny.

710
00:41:52,940 --> 00:41:57,140
So all of a sudden I just
got this shipment of these
colorful weights and I was

711
00:41:57,141 --> 00:42:00,140
laughing going, Oh man, I must've
fucked it up. I got the colorful ones.

712
00:42:00,141 --> 00:42:04,100
So I wrote them trying to ask how
to send it back and they said no,

713
00:42:04,190 --> 00:42:07,670
we listened to the podcast and they sent
me some free weight and they sent me a

714
00:42:07,910 --> 00:42:10,790
tee shirts. I, you know, rogue
fitness. I was fucking around.

715
00:42:10,791 --> 00:42:15,320
You didn't have to do that. You guys
are solid man. And um, I can't wait to,

716
00:42:15,830 --> 00:42:19,130
uh, you know, you share your
equipment cause it's, you know,

717
00:42:19,220 --> 00:42:23,750
it's great made in the USA. All good
stuff. Oh look who's here. The busy body,

718
00:42:23,930 --> 00:42:26,900
the lovely Nia.
She gets some Thai food.

719
00:42:28,040 --> 00:42:32,870
Did you grab a Mike or do you want to eat?
Do you want to eat?

720
00:42:32,990 --> 00:42:36,320
I got another, uh, 17 minutes here.

721
00:42:37,910 --> 00:42:41,420
17 minutes to Mike's who
were in the closet. Oh,

722
00:42:41,421 --> 00:42:43,820
why don't you want to just sit down
and help me through with the questions?

723
00:42:46,050 --> 00:42:47,840
Why do I hook it up? Cause I am, I am a,

724
00:42:47,841 --> 00:42:52,730
I'm actively doing the podcast
right now actively. Oh,

725
00:42:52,731 --> 00:42:55,520
Jesus. You know, if he going
to be in a mood like that.

726
00:42:56,420 --> 00:43:00,830
Oh Jesus.
What's that?

727
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:05,660
He just walked out on me.
Um, anyways. All right,

728
00:43:05,661 --> 00:43:07,430
well I'm going to start
reading the first one then.

729
00:43:09,850 --> 00:43:14,630
You don't care. All right. Oh,
by the way, you know something,

730
00:43:14,631 --> 00:43:16,950
I was taking my dog out for a walk today.
You know,

731
00:43:16,970 --> 00:43:21,860
we were walking up into the park there
and this is before she puked and I

732
00:43:21,861 --> 00:43:23,660
decided to turn around and come home.

733
00:43:24,170 --> 00:43:28,250
She started nowhere where she started
yakking. Uh, made me feel bad. I was like,

734
00:43:28,251 --> 00:43:32,060
Jesus, I hope it wasn't something I
did. It wasn't hard out or anything.

735
00:43:33,500 --> 00:43:36,630
Um, another [inaudible] has a
very sensitive stomach. Well,

736
00:43:36,631 --> 00:43:39,050
another fucking group of people come
up the second they get into the,

737
00:43:39,430 --> 00:43:41,290
into the park,
they just fucking don't say what Parker.

738
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:44,810
They get on the fucking park and they
fucking take the leashes off the fucking

739
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:49,190
dogs come right up to my dog and they're
like, no worries. She's friendly,

740
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:52,480
she's friendly.
It's like my dog isn't my dog,

741
00:43:52,510 --> 00:43:55,150
my dog is ignores other dogs.

742
00:43:55,390 --> 00:44:00,340
It chills and then like when you
are bugging my dog, it doesn't go.

743
00:44:00,341 --> 00:44:03,340
It never has the, hey, can you do
me a favor? Can you knock it off?

744
00:44:03,450 --> 00:44:04,900
It immediately just grabs you.

745
00:44:04,960 --> 00:44:08,830
Like remember Friday the 13th when
Jason was under the Cot and grabbed that

746
00:44:08,831 --> 00:44:11,770
dude's head and reached up, I guess
it was the chicken, the first one.

747
00:44:11,860 --> 00:44:15,010
I met a dog tonight who
just didn't like anybody,

748
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:17,320
but I realized quickly what it was.

749
00:44:17,620 --> 00:44:22,420
His owner was holding him and
anytime anyone came towards
the honor like, Oh hey,

750
00:44:22,421 --> 00:44:25,840
oh, what a cute dog. The
dog was crawling and I,

751
00:44:25,960 --> 00:44:30,070
and it's so funny because he said to one
of the people, oh, pet him. And I'm like,

752
00:44:30,071 --> 00:44:31,980
no, your dog isn't, doesn't want to be

753
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:33,720
pet.
It growls at everybody.

754
00:44:34,290 --> 00:44:39,150
And I think the dog was protecting the
owner. So anytime, you know, like I said,

755
00:44:39,151 --> 00:44:40,920
anyone who came towards him,
he started growling,

756
00:44:40,921 --> 00:44:45,060
but he was so clueless that he was
like, oh, was ease vine, just pet him.

757
00:44:45,300 --> 00:44:50,070
And I'm like, no, no, you can't pet the
dog if it's growling at people. I can.

758
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:54,690
The dog went to bite me like
it actually kind of like put,

759
00:44:55,070 --> 00:44:58,620
it's around my bigger walked
across the fucking bro.

760
00:44:58,621 --> 00:45:00,710
I went over and it put its,

761
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:04,800
it's put my finger in between
its teeth and didn't chomp down.

762
00:45:04,801 --> 00:45:07,110
But it was yes,
but it was a biting

763
00:45:08,820 --> 00:45:12,540
behavior basically.
Dog Man with little dogs with people.

764
00:45:12,541 --> 00:45:17,040
They'd be riding around in convertibles,
you know, like a corvette or some shit.

765
00:45:17,340 --> 00:45:19,350
Right.
We'll have to leave in 11 minutes.

766
00:45:19,860 --> 00:45:23,930
All right, so you want to do one, one
question? Yeah, let's do it. Alright.

767
00:45:24,020 --> 00:45:27,650
Job a Billy baret. Um, I, we're,

768
00:45:27,651 --> 00:45:29,900
I'm working part time
job and I have a problem.

769
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:33,680
Let me see if there's a relationship
one here. Why can't well boyfriend,

770
00:45:33,980 --> 00:45:37,350
can I not be involved in the the job one?
Well,

771
00:45:37,370 --> 00:45:41,270
I just feel like I always
give the guy advice.

772
00:45:42,710 --> 00:45:45,920
Well maybe it's time to shake it up a
little bit less. I was trying to do,

773
00:45:45,921 --> 00:45:48,380
have you feel some lady
advice on some relationship?

774
00:45:50,300 --> 00:45:50,980
Huh?

775
00:45:50,980 --> 00:45:52,990
Oh God. Are you going to
go on a feminist rant here?

776
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,150
You know women can answer other fucking
questions too, you know. All right.

777
00:45:57,160 --> 00:45:59,650
Let's get another question that doesn't
have to do with relationships. Hey,

778
00:45:59,651 --> 00:46:02,500
you know, I'm trying to give you a
nice softball here in front of lob.

779
00:46:02,501 --> 00:46:05,750
It over the fucking place. Fucking
softball. Anything to me first?

780
00:46:06,400 --> 00:46:10,180
Rolling your head. Here we go. When
all reality show me there. All right.

781
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:14,740
I'm working a part time job and I have
a problem related to it. All right.

782
00:46:14,770 --> 00:46:18,790
The job is I work at a fucking ice cream.

783
00:46:20,670 --> 00:46:25,670
It's at an ice cream place in my town and
the second time I worked there a while

784
00:46:25,811 --> 00:46:27,910
back,
I had a godawful shift.

785
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:32,500
I didn't have all the kinks of the job
worked yet and I was working with someone

786
00:46:32,740 --> 00:46:37,100
I didn't know, which made me more
nervous. The night quickly became, uh,

787
00:46:37,870 --> 00:46:42,120
you know this word Koffka esque
parade. Who's, who's that?

788
00:46:44,160 --> 00:46:44,510
Okay.

789
00:46:44,510 --> 00:46:48,620
Oh No, he's a writer. Is he a philosopher?

790
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,240
I'm going to have a
particular political view.

791
00:46:52,300 --> 00:46:53,770
I think he died in a boating accident.

792
00:46:55,090 --> 00:46:59,260
Communist Kafka ask Joseph Kafka.

793
00:46:59,490 --> 00:47:04,000
I think he's one of those. He's
like a philosopher. J Lo now,

794
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:07,320
before she goes on tour,
I'm not going to lie and say,

795
00:47:07,580 --> 00:47:12,550
know exactly who can we Google it though?
I really feel like it's a Joseph Kafka.

796
00:47:12,700 --> 00:47:13,960
We just read the fucking question.

797
00:47:14,650 --> 00:47:19,480
The night quickly became a Kafka
s parade of a horrific errors.

798
00:47:19,481 --> 00:47:24,270
I screwed up, orders, stock things wrong,
et Cetera, and by the end of the night,

799
00:47:24,290 --> 00:47:28,870
my coworker was audibly invisibly
disgusted with me and she should have

800
00:47:30,010 --> 00:47:33,940
John's Kafka. Okay, sorry. Chairman.

801
00:47:33,941 --> 00:47:38,540
Language writer of novels
and short stories. Who is?

802
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:39,141
Oh my God.

803
00:47:39,141 --> 00:47:43,700
He died the day after my birthday
and there in lies the tragedy.

804
00:47:45,360 --> 00:47:48,710
All right, here we go. All
right. Put down your phone.

805
00:47:48,711 --> 00:47:53,540
Let me briefly try to learn what car I
was going to say. Surreal. I was right.

806
00:47:53,541 --> 00:47:58,460
Yes. Um, [inaudible] this
is not an entertaining,

807
00:47:58,550 --> 00:48:00,470
sorry.
Entertaining for people.

808
00:48:00,500 --> 00:48:03,590
Kafka ass elements often
appear in existential works,

809
00:48:03,591 --> 00:48:06,500
but the term has transcended
the literary realms.

810
00:48:06,710 --> 00:48:11,060
Reply to real life occurrences
in situations that are in
comprehensively complex,

811
00:48:11,330 --> 00:48:15,620
bizarre or illogical. There
we go. Franz Kafka. Alright.

812
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:17,270
Okay.
Okay.

813
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:20,440
All right. So the ladies
or the lady is, is,

814
00:48:20,500 --> 00:48:24,430
was upset with him and he's saying you
audibly and visibly discussed it with me

815
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:27,860
and she should have been okay.
She's in college and Almond Highschool.

816
00:48:27,970 --> 00:48:32,500
So luckily I never had to work with her
again after the summer was over and she

817
00:48:32,501 --> 00:48:36,880
went back to her classes.
But even as recently as spring break,

818
00:48:37,030 --> 00:48:39,580
I've heard she's still
talking shit about me.

819
00:48:41,080 --> 00:48:44,370
Well, you heard this all the
way back. She's at some college.

820
00:48:44,700 --> 00:48:48,510
How did you hear that? Yeah,
they're all on the Facebook. Um,

821
00:48:49,980 --> 00:48:54,490
oh. Grampy I love saying that. The
faith. Have you guys taken the Molly

822
00:48:56,020 --> 00:48:58,970
don't know. You wouldn't, you
wouldn't know Molly if you're the,

823
00:48:59,590 --> 00:49:03,720
we like Molly ecstasy,
whatever. Just an old guy. Yeah,

824
00:49:03,721 --> 00:49:06,120
that was my dad when he used
to get mad at my sister Christ.

825
00:49:06,121 --> 00:49:09,090
Is she on that Internet Internet?

826
00:49:09,590 --> 00:49:09,630
Um,

827
00:49:09,630 --> 00:49:14,630
it's almost summer again and I'm almost
definitely going to have to face or if I

828
00:49:15,091 --> 00:49:19,170
work regularly, if I do, I know for a
fact I'll fuck things up immediately.

829
00:49:19,171 --> 00:49:20,090
Purely from anxiety,

830
00:49:20,110 --> 00:49:24,730
anxiety. Dude, you should be
like the fucking older wiser guy.

831
00:49:24,731 --> 00:49:28,900
Crushing it and then you fucking
banger confidence in my, wait what?

832
00:49:29,380 --> 00:49:33,520
What do you mean banger? It's all there.
Why do you what? What is all there?

833
00:49:33,521 --> 00:49:36,760
You can make your remarks. You
get two straws. You know why?

834
00:49:37,030 --> 00:49:41,590
Cause she's the older woman. Right. And
she has to be tamed by getting that deck.

835
00:49:41,620 --> 00:49:45,430
Is that what it is? I
didn't say that. You did.

836
00:49:46,420 --> 00:49:49,900
No, I willing go after the
confidence and then get banger. Yeah,

837
00:49:50,260 --> 00:49:55,260
because your life is like a fucking movie
from the 1920s bill where the guy is

838
00:49:55,301 --> 00:49:59,110
slapping a woman around. I was like get
it together to see and she's hysterical.

839
00:49:59,260 --> 00:50:01,220
He completely fucked up person.

840
00:50:01,760 --> 00:50:05,150
This is like one of those coming of
age movies weren't the begin beginning.

841
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:06,920
The nerds, look, you'll walk away from me.

842
00:50:07,190 --> 00:50:12,190
The NERC is looking at the cheerleader
and she's dating the impossible Dick with

843
00:50:12,291 --> 00:50:16,640
the blonde wavy hair, right?
Somebody does a fucking triple Lindy.

844
00:50:18,330 --> 00:50:18,610
Okay.

845
00:50:18,610 --> 00:50:22,930
Jesus Christ. I went sideways.
Huh? The fuck just happened there.

846
00:50:24,140 --> 00:50:24,680
Okay

847
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:27,650
listen cause I'm not going to be able
to get a word in and defense what I was

848
00:50:27,651 --> 00:50:30,740
saying, right? He makes an ass
out of himself in front of this.

849
00:50:31,130 --> 00:50:35,330
You know they sold a fucking broad.
All right. See this isn't sexist.

850
00:50:36,380 --> 00:50:38,570
Now you come back, you're a little
older, a little wiser, right?

851
00:50:38,571 --> 00:50:41,870
You're a year older, you still growing,
you filled out a little bit, right?

852
00:50:42,440 --> 00:50:43,700
All of a sudden you're crushing it.

853
00:50:44,240 --> 00:50:49,240
He make it a fucking couple banana splits
in a smoothie all at the same time and

854
00:50:49,971 --> 00:50:54,550
she's just like, wow, this isn't the
man that I left the year. You know,

855
00:50:54,710 --> 00:50:59,390
the year before, all of a sudden you
guys are working closely. You know,

856
00:50:59,480 --> 00:51:01,010
ice cream is always romantic.

857
00:51:01,050 --> 00:51:04,130
What kind of fucked of advice that
you get given anything and fight.

858
00:51:04,650 --> 00:51:05,690
I'm telling this kid to fuck.

859
00:51:05,740 --> 00:51:09,060
You can shake it off. He
goes, if I don't work often,

860
00:51:09,061 --> 00:51:13,140
I could lose my job as we've got more
employees than we need and I really have a

861
00:51:13,141 --> 00:51:16,050
great setup now that I've learned it,
the work is easy.

862
00:51:16,051 --> 00:51:20,070
I basically pick my own hours and
my bosses by far the sweetest,

863
00:51:20,071 --> 00:51:22,440
racist homophobe I've ever met in my life.

864
00:51:22,860 --> 00:51:27,730
Any ideas besides the obvious murder?
He said your stand up is kill.

865
00:51:27,731 --> 00:51:29,850
I hope I can see performed
sometime. Yeah, dude,

866
00:51:29,880 --> 00:51:33,450
you gotta you gotta grow a Dick
here, man. You're the fucking man.

867
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:38,250
You've been there for a year. You know
what's going on. Just be like a, I dunno.

868
00:51:38,300 --> 00:51:41,670
Just, I don't know. What do you, is
this, do you have a crush on this woman?

869
00:51:41,910 --> 00:51:43,680
If she's not going to fuck you,
then what?

870
00:51:43,681 --> 00:51:46,800
Do you care what she
thinks is that bad deal?

871
00:51:46,910 --> 00:51:50,570
Yes.
What is fucking has to do with it?

872
00:51:50,810 --> 00:51:54,140
Does have competence in yourself
and do the job. Also, this is,

873
00:51:54,440 --> 00:51:56,360
this is a high school
person that's writing in.

874
00:51:56,720 --> 00:51:59,840
This is somebody who's making ice cream
cones and he's scared out of his mind

875
00:52:00,110 --> 00:52:02,480
about some woman who is not
easy and he's not even fucking,

876
00:52:02,660 --> 00:52:05,420
he doesn't want to ask her out.
What is the problem?

877
00:52:05,450 --> 00:52:07,430
She's going to yell at you about
the way you put the fucking yeah.

878
00:52:07,850 --> 00:52:10,260
Cherries on stuff because as
a job and he's in, you know,

879
00:52:10,261 --> 00:52:13,800
worried about how he's going to perceive
you as one of those like to be at that

880
00:52:13,801 --> 00:52:18,801
age where you know every little thing
you know means disaster and the bigger

881
00:52:19,411 --> 00:52:23,910
picture. Oh, so is he, cause it's
just a job a little bit. Yeah.

882
00:52:23,911 --> 00:52:27,750
I think you're worried a little too
much about nothing. Just do your job,

883
00:52:28,020 --> 00:52:30,300
do your thing,
don't even worry about it.

884
00:52:30,360 --> 00:52:33,630
And there's plenty of other
jobs out there by the way,

885
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:35,130
and you should just be totally,
yeah.

886
00:52:35,530 --> 00:52:36,363
Cocky,
which comes in

887
00:52:37,620 --> 00:52:41,550
what a bitch. Yeah, I'm
sure that'll go real well.

888
00:52:44,680 --> 00:52:45,513
Be a float.

889
00:52:45,570 --> 00:52:50,480
Float is how long do [inaudible]
kiss with the little peace sign? No,

890
00:52:52,590 --> 00:52:54,930
no honey. Yeah. Ice
Cream. We had to decide

891
00:52:56,040 --> 00:53:00,540
we pussy or nothing.
Jesus Christ pushing all the chips.

892
00:53:00,650 --> 00:53:04,470
And this is the world series of poker.
All right. Hey there, Billy boy.

893
00:53:04,660 --> 00:53:08,550
I'm a new listener to your podcast,
but a long time fan of you stand up.

894
00:53:08,551 --> 00:53:13,170
I was wondering if you could help
me out with a dilemma I'm facing.

895
00:53:13,530 --> 00:53:18,150
So my weed dealer put the moves on me.
My last time I was at our place,

896
00:53:19,060 --> 00:53:20,040
uh,
nothing came of it,

897
00:53:20,041 --> 00:53:23,370
but I could tell she was trying
to get me to fucker until now.

898
00:53:23,371 --> 00:53:26,970
I thought it was weird that she began
sell me pot for practically nothing.

899
00:53:27,160 --> 00:53:28,640
Hm. Hm Hm hm. Wow.

900
00:53:29,450 --> 00:53:30,231
She's cool.

901
00:53:30,231 --> 00:53:35,231
And I've hung out with her at her place
many times to just smoke weed just,

902
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:37,280
just as well.
I'm single,

903
00:53:37,510 --> 00:53:40,700
so I have no problem getting some
strange pussy that falls into my lap.

904
00:53:41,030 --> 00:53:44,000
The problem is that she's a very heavy,

905
00:53:44,001 --> 00:53:46,260
broad and completely unattractive.
Yeah.

906
00:53:46,320 --> 00:53:47,600
Oh.

907
00:53:48,800 --> 00:53:53,300
Gvh. But she sells the best weed
in the area. Dude, this is fucking,

908
00:53:53,301 --> 00:53:57,080
this has all the makings of the
great first 10 pages of a script.

909
00:53:57,380 --> 00:53:59,240
We've established who the characters are.

910
00:53:59,480 --> 00:54:02,930
Oh yeah. Now we've got the Rabo
super far with this premise.

911
00:54:04,200 --> 00:54:08,560
Oh God, I love, you know
what? I love to do that.

912
00:54:08,630 --> 00:54:12,320
You know that guy can help it.
You know that guys just want to fuck you.

913
00:54:12,710 --> 00:54:13,610
Women know that.

914
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:17,520
Use it to your advantage to get
shit and then when we admit that,

915
00:54:17,570 --> 00:54:21,350
but that's what we want to do.
Look, go put good dude. Oh my God.

916
00:54:21,351 --> 00:54:24,980
I really wish someone would tell a
story about a guy who was getting thrown

917
00:54:24,981 --> 00:54:27,350
pussy left and right and
doesn't know what to do with it.

918
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:30,710
And it's like a coming of age and I'm
sure he's also fighting with his friends a

919
00:54:30,711 --> 00:54:34,640
little bit about leg. What
door? We're going to stay in
and go. This is hilarious.

920
00:54:35,960 --> 00:54:39,740
He's got this heavy bride that he's not
attracted to. Who's fucking weed dealer?

921
00:54:39,770 --> 00:54:43,700
Yeah, she's got the best weed. Yeah, he
knows he wants, she wants to fuck them.

922
00:54:44,000 --> 00:54:47,630
What was the rest of the story? Does
he want, this is the fuck come on.

923
00:54:47,810 --> 00:54:49,280
That's Rogan would crush this.

924
00:54:50,820 --> 00:54:51,653
Hmm.

925
00:54:52,130 --> 00:54:54,240
Oh, you are in it. You know what?
You're hungry. You're like him.

926
00:54:54,320 --> 00:54:59,320
When that snickers commercial you are
where Seth Rogan would write a phenomenal

927
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:04,250
transcendent script that Jonah Hill would
act out and it would just be like, wow,

928
00:55:04,310 --> 00:55:05,360
is this what it's like?

929
00:55:06,270 --> 00:55:07,103
Okay,

930
00:55:07,860 --> 00:55:12,640
what is wrong with you?
I like all of those people.

931
00:55:12,850 --> 00:55:14,080
And I like those movies.

932
00:55:14,140 --> 00:55:17,950
You don't like hot tub time machine like
to meet Chubby in awkward and not know

933
00:55:17,951 --> 00:55:22,330
what to do with your life. Oh, what
are you way being a jerk? I don't know.

934
00:55:22,360 --> 00:55:24,070
You're being a jerk,
right? Yeah. You're hungry.

935
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:28,870
I am being a little bit of
a generic apologized to Seth
Rogen mobile. I'm a little

936
00:55:29,730 --> 00:55:33,140
okay. Yeah, you are. You're a little
out of sorts here. Okay. All right.

937
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:36,150
You leave you burning bridges in this
town, Sweetie. Let me tell you something.

938
00:55:36,151 --> 00:55:40,620
Those bridges don't come back,
but she sells the best weed in the area.

939
00:55:40,621 --> 00:55:41,454
I don't want,

940
00:55:42,120 --> 00:55:46,080
I don't want to not fucker
and then ever cut me off,

941
00:55:46,260 --> 00:55:50,640
but at the same time I feel that I,
if I do fucker,

942
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:56,280
then I'm no better than an addicted crack
whore doing a line off some fat guy's

943
00:55:57,300 --> 00:55:58,950
Dick Maybe. Uh, so guess what,

944
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:02,310
when it comes down to what do I
fuck my ugly drug dealer for good,

945
00:56:02,710 --> 00:56:04,220
cheap we do.

946
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:09,630
Or do I just find a new dealer
with super urban pay more money.

947
00:56:10,320 --> 00:56:15,270
Thanks. Hope all is well with you,
ginger. Fuck Cause Shit. Ginger. Fuck.

948
00:56:16,620 --> 00:56:20,280
Um, have you ever had any of
suppression? Don't shit where you eat.

949
00:56:21,870 --> 00:56:24,190
Yeah.
Don't fuck your weed dealer.

950
00:56:24,370 --> 00:56:28,870
Yeah. Don't just don't fuck her. This is
a business relationship. Keep it business.

951
00:56:28,990 --> 00:56:33,160
Should he like lie and start talking
about how we as a girlfriend? No.

952
00:56:33,161 --> 00:56:37,570
Just buy weed from her and like, just let
it be business. Stop Smoking with the,

953
00:56:38,320 --> 00:56:42,100
and also like, I mean, maybe
she's desperate for your cock,

954
00:56:42,101 --> 00:56:43,930
but maybe you're like reading into it.

955
00:56:44,350 --> 00:56:46,810
She might be trying to
fuck you and the next dude

956
00:56:48,510 --> 00:56:50,710
[inaudible] she's a drug dealer.
She's hustling,

957
00:56:50,890 --> 00:56:54,580
she's hustling for like customers.
She's hustling for Dick. Like,

958
00:56:54,581 --> 00:56:58,880
don't get excited. You know, you're
not the only one bra, so you think

959
00:57:00,880 --> 00:57:04,080
we'll wait for next to nothing. If she
does that. She's not gonna make any money.

960
00:57:04,940 --> 00:57:08,650
True. She's making it in
other ways. I don't know.

961
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:10,990
I feel like just don't
fuck your weed dealer.

962
00:57:10,991 --> 00:57:15,100
That just sounds like a disaster written
all over it or get yourself a really

963
00:57:15,101 --> 00:57:18,970
good connect.
Now have that in your back pocket.

964
00:57:18,971 --> 00:57:22,480
So if you do decide that the only reason
why you would fuck your weed dealer is

965
00:57:22,481 --> 00:57:24,070
if you actually want to fuck her,

966
00:57:24,370 --> 00:57:27,520
not because you're so desperate
for the best we'd ever have.

967
00:57:27,521 --> 00:57:30,490
You really had the best weed
and like your entire city,

968
00:57:30,670 --> 00:57:35,440
probably not so calm down.
Don't back dealer. Uh Huh.

969
00:57:35,960 --> 00:57:38,750
I mean, you know, you're kinda into
the habit. You're not just going, hey,

970
00:57:38,751 --> 00:57:42,260
can I get a hit off that when you fucking
go in there week after week to the

971
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:43,160
point that the

972
00:57:43,490 --> 00:57:47,210
we dealers are a dime a dozen
though, there's, it's not
like it's a special time.

973
00:57:47,220 --> 00:57:51,090
Just say it. This fucking chick is,
he's, he's buying so much weed off from,

974
00:57:51,091 --> 00:57:53,550
she's developing feelings for,
she's not,

975
00:57:55,230 --> 00:58:00,000
he might be cute, he's crushed.
But like, it's not that. It's,

976
00:58:00,420 --> 00:58:02,190
my point is it's not that serious.

977
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:05,640
Don't fuck your weed dealer unless you
want to have a problem with your weed

978
00:58:05,641 --> 00:58:07,400
dealer and you didn't want to achieve.

979
00:58:07,401 --> 00:58:09,870
You don't want to have a problem
with drug deal. Trust me,

980
00:58:09,930 --> 00:58:13,920
we dealer wants to fuck one
of her customers. Course.
I completely believe it.

981
00:58:13,921 --> 00:58:17,490
I'm just saying just don't, don't
go there. It's not worth it.

982
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:22,310
That's my bottom line. She's usually
not this grumpy. You guys. Alright.

983
00:58:22,350 --> 00:58:25,500
Grumpy old boyfriend,
texts wife.

984
00:58:27,890 --> 00:58:31,350
Oh Billy cheeseballs. Where'd
that come from? I don't know.

985
00:58:31,390 --> 00:58:33,530
Just fucking make up names
for me. Oh, okay. All right.

986
00:58:33,531 --> 00:58:37,520
Very happily married for 25 years to
the hottest wife and mother of our three

987
00:58:37,521 --> 00:58:38,240
sons.

988
00:58:38,240 --> 00:58:42,660
She's in spectacular shape and beautiful
while on vacation in palm springs.

989
00:58:43,220 --> 00:58:45,460
Bang. Right. Just keep yourself in shape.

990
00:58:51,210 --> 00:58:53,550
Yeah. We're visual animals.
We're visual animals.

991
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:57,540
I know there's a reason why all those gay
guys are walking around with six packs

992
00:58:57,780 --> 00:58:59,070
because they know what
they're trying to attract.

993
00:59:00,750 --> 00:59:02,370
Yeah.
Don't bring the gaze into,

994
00:59:02,530 --> 00:59:05,740
do you think all those gay guys want to
go to the gym that much? They have to.

995
00:59:07,480 --> 00:59:11,560
If they don't, that's the end of the Dick
Train and they know it. They know it.

996
00:59:12,990 --> 00:59:15,910
All right.
So anyways,

997
00:59:16,390 --> 00:59:18,610
while on vacation in Palm Springs,

998
00:59:18,670 --> 00:59:23,670
I caught a glimpse of her phone
screen and saw text from PB.

999
00:59:23,691 --> 00:59:26,960
Pb was asking,
how's the weather?

1000
00:59:27,530 --> 00:59:32,330
So I asked her who PB is after a
little persuasion. She replied,

1001
00:59:32,331 --> 00:59:33,290
it's Dave.

1002
00:59:33,830 --> 00:59:38,830
Dave is a boyfriend from her high
school years and he is a former fiance.

1003
00:59:39,860 --> 00:59:43,910
This is awful.
She promised it was nothing.

1004
00:59:45,590 --> 00:59:49,670
I asked if they'd seen each other
underneath the different name though.

1005
00:59:49,780 --> 00:59:50,140
Yeah.

1006
00:59:50,140 --> 00:59:55,140
That's pretty suspect when you have
the person's name saved under an alias.

1007
00:59:57,150 --> 01:00:01,960
Pb was p beaming.
Wait is the pain is brilliant.

1008
01:00:02,290 --> 01:00:04,300
Brilliant Penis.
She's dyslexic.

1009
01:00:07,650 --> 01:00:08,840
Penis Babe.
Penis,

1010
01:00:12,470 --> 01:00:15,640
pussy banger maybe.

1011
01:00:17,770 --> 01:00:19,030
I'm sure it's something in between that

1012
01:00:19,050 --> 01:00:21,930
it was a capital p and then a lowercase B.
I don't know why he did it.

1013
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:26,080
I don't know if you guys
have any suggestions what
PB would stand for. Come on.

1014
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:30,750
And what social media is
all about is he goes, uh,

1015
01:00:30,810 --> 01:00:33,230
she promised it was nothing.
I asked if,

1016
01:00:33,270 --> 01:00:37,200
if they had seen each other or
slept together. She said, no,

1017
01:00:37,890 --> 01:00:42,690
I believe her. Okay. Oh, Jesus.

1018
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:46,020
It's a pharmacy. Her
fiance. Does he mean now?

1019
01:00:46,350 --> 01:00:48,630
I guess now or maybe I
just want to believe her.

1020
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:51,450
She is otherwise a very honest person.
Well,

1021
01:00:51,451 --> 01:00:56,010
I sent Dave a text and here's what I said.
Oh,

1022
01:00:56,070 --> 01:00:58,350
beautiful.
I'm only going to say this once.

1023
01:00:58,380 --> 01:01:00,600
You're nothing but a sleazy cock sucker.

1024
01:01:01,560 --> 01:01:04,800
You've crossed the line of decency.
Go Fuck Yourself.

1025
01:01:05,070 --> 01:01:08,300
Or better yet go choke to
death on some poor. Yeah,

1026
01:01:09,330 --> 01:01:13,590
something that he's Dick. Wait,
what? So it's a, it's a homophobic.

1027
01:01:14,490 --> 01:01:19,470
They was upset. Okay. Never communicate
with my wife capital letters ever.

1028
01:01:19,740 --> 01:01:21,150
If you pursue her in any way,

1029
01:01:21,151 --> 01:01:25,170
I'll cut your dick off with a rusty saw
blade and shove it down your throat.

1030
01:01:25,530 --> 01:01:30,240
I hope you're getting the message
here. His reply. Understood.

1031
01:01:30,241 --> 01:01:33,990
This is the last text
name and number deleted.

1032
01:01:35,450 --> 01:01:35,600
Okay.

1033
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:39,030
My question to you is,
was I harsh enough with,

1034
01:01:41,120 --> 01:01:43,700
and I'm not sure what to do with my wife.

1035
01:01:43,701 --> 01:01:48,560
She deleted him from our context
and she said she has no need to ever

1036
01:01:48,561 --> 01:01:51,500
communicate with him again.
What are your thoughts?

1037
01:01:52,360 --> 01:01:53,193
Well,

1038
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,970
I think you need to let it
be then. I mean, I, that was,

1039
01:01:59,180 --> 01:02:03,140
I have to say that was masterful.
All that text that he sent to PB,

1040
01:02:04,220 --> 01:02:09,080
Aka Dave. I think he got the message
with that one now. What do you think? Uh,

1041
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:10,723
yeah.

1042
01:02:12,230 --> 01:02:16,340
So do you think she banged him? No,
she was probably setting, flirting,

1043
01:02:17,030 --> 01:02:19,250
borderline inappropriate text messages.

1044
01:02:21,410 --> 01:02:23,730
[inaudible] years of those beautiful
of the day. I took you to prom.

1045
01:02:24,470 --> 01:02:25,830
Okayi like that type of shit.

1046
01:02:27,370 --> 01:02:31,150
Why are you [inaudible] than
that? I don't fucking know.

1047
01:02:31,560 --> 01:02:35,540
I [inaudible] you bill barr.

1048
01:02:36,070 --> 01:02:38,330
Probably what it said.
Something like that. So hear me,

1049
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:41,080
cause you know how you are,

1050
01:02:41,081 --> 01:02:44,590
you probably would've said some
inappropriate shit ever taxed. I mean,

1051
01:02:44,620 --> 01:02:48,700
that's what, yeah. Is that
with texting is, it's,

1052
01:02:49,130 --> 01:02:53,380
it's how do I, how do I, how
do I get to the texting to

1053
01:02:54,960 --> 01:02:59,920
please explain how texting
works. All right. Advice from
a, for a fellow ginger. Oh,

1054
01:03:00,570 --> 01:03:04,240
moving right along,
right along a fellow Cinzia.

1055
01:03:05,360 --> 01:03:10,360
Here I am a decision to make and would
appreciate some advice from a wise and

1056
01:03:10,861 --> 01:03:14,910
experienced man like you.
Ever since I was a kid. Oh,

1057
01:03:15,070 --> 01:03:17,940
you've just every fucking thing.
Ever since I was a kid,

1058
01:03:17,941 --> 01:03:19,650
I've wanted to be an airline pilot.

1059
01:03:20,190 --> 01:03:24,390
I'm 19 years old and I'm graduating
from high school in December. Yes.

1060
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,820
Here we finish high school later.

1061
01:03:27,250 --> 01:03:31,090
I was just going to say, is that when they
graduate from high school and Finland?

1062
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:34,100
Yeah. Later. Then you
guys in Mirka. Alright.

1063
01:03:34,270 --> 01:03:38,120
I have til the end of the year
to decide what I want to study.

1064
01:03:38,210 --> 01:03:42,860
I've always had a plan after high school.
I would want to uh,

1065
01:03:42,890 --> 01:03:44,960
go to a flight academy and become a pilot.

1066
01:03:45,260 --> 01:03:48,350
But now I've started to question if that's
what I really want to do for a living

1067
01:03:48,590 --> 01:03:51,470
living. I mean an airline
pilot is an incredible job,

1068
01:03:51,471 --> 01:03:54,320
absolutely love flying and
we get to travel a bunch of,

1069
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:56,330
see all kinds of amazing places,
et Cetera.

1070
01:03:56,660 --> 01:04:01,660
Plus I would get to the sun every day
without burning my Nordic ultra pasty,

1071
01:04:03,560 --> 01:04:07,880
pasty skin. Um, captain makes six figures,

1072
01:04:08,330 --> 01:04:10,790
which is plenty enough for
me since I'm not into money.

1073
01:04:11,030 --> 01:04:14,630
My only problem with being a pilot is
that I would never be completely free.

1074
01:04:14,900 --> 01:04:18,380
Meaning that for the rest of my life,
working for some other douchebag,

1075
01:04:19,910 --> 01:04:24,440
uh, would, would decide for me when I
can come to work and where I can fly.

1076
01:04:24,680 --> 01:04:29,060
The idea of being tied up to a company
and having some con making all the

1077
01:04:29,061 --> 01:04:33,470
decisions for me scares the
shit out of me when I'm older.

1078
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:38,390
I want to be able to do things on an
impulse without asking permission from uh,

1079
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:41,980
some capital,
those other men also pilots,

1080
01:04:42,110 --> 01:04:45,360
but you're just over there taking
pictures of Shit in you. Um,

1081
01:04:45,980 --> 01:04:49,430
also pilots spent a lot of time away
from home and some day when I start a

1082
01:04:49,431 --> 01:04:52,070
family and have kids, I want to spend
as much time as possible with them.

1083
01:04:52,071 --> 01:04:53,690
So that could be a problem as well.

1084
01:04:53,691 --> 01:04:55,790
Flying planes for living
would be a dream job,

1085
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:59,000
but it would get in the way of my other
dream of being completely my own man and

1086
01:04:59,001 --> 01:05:02,180
free. What do you think? Should
I go study something else? No.

1087
01:05:02,210 --> 01:05:05,030
What you should do is still
be into the aviation thing.

1088
01:05:05,030 --> 01:05:08,420
You just figure out a way to do
what you want to do within aviation.

1089
01:05:09,680 --> 01:05:14,300
Okay. I will equate it to the job
that I have. I am a standup comedian,

1090
01:05:14,301 --> 01:05:17,120
which opens up all these doors
into the entertainment world,

1091
01:05:17,350 --> 01:05:20,980
which a lot of them you think you want
to run through until you get to the other

1092
01:05:20,981 --> 01:05:24,550
side. And then you realize what you're
talking about is like, holy fuck,

1093
01:05:25,060 --> 01:05:27,700
I thought I had the world by the balls.
If I got this,

1094
01:05:27,730 --> 01:05:29,020
I thought I would be the pimp.

1095
01:05:29,021 --> 01:05:33,670
And then you realize that you're
actually the whore. So you have to,

1096
01:05:34,210 --> 01:05:34,780
um,

1097
01:05:34,780 --> 01:05:39,760
what I would do if I was you is I
would still go to flight school.

1098
01:05:39,761 --> 01:05:41,140
I would learn how to fly.

1099
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:46,180
And then when I would do is rather
than going flying for some commercial

1100
01:05:46,181 --> 01:05:49,660
airline, there's gotta be some
other cool shit that you can do,

1101
01:05:49,661 --> 01:05:54,040
like flying for sightseeing tours.
You're not into money, right?

1102
01:05:54,610 --> 01:05:58,150
Maybe you do that and maybe you end up
having that business and other people fly

1103
01:05:58,151 --> 01:06:02,740
for you and you get to fly around.
Um, what other jobs are they?

1104
01:06:02,950 --> 01:06:04,420
There's fighting forest fires,
you know,

1105
01:06:04,421 --> 01:06:08,410
you do that and like helicopters and
planes and that type of shit. Yeah.

1106
01:06:10,120 --> 01:06:15,010
Um, listen, just by being a pilot already,

1107
01:06:15,430 --> 01:06:17,700
you got some sort of
renegade spirit in your,

1108
01:06:17,710 --> 01:06:22,710
so I'm sure there's plenty of fucking
jobs that you can get in aviation.

1109
01:06:24,040 --> 01:06:26,380
I think in pretty much any job there's,

1110
01:06:26,410 --> 01:06:30,430
there's a way to be in the matrix and
then there's a way to be outside. Like,

1111
01:06:30,431 --> 01:06:34,660
you know, he's a renegade. That one, you
know, don't get tied down with that guy.

1112
01:06:34,661 --> 01:06:38,600
You can definitely do it. Right.
What do you think? Yes. Yeah.

1113
01:06:38,601 --> 01:06:42,790
So he should still be a pilot to do you
love to fly. It's what you wanna do. Um,

1114
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:46,900
but you know, there's, there's all kinds
of shit you can fly for fucking airline,

1115
01:06:47,050 --> 01:06:50,170
make your money and then leave
and then go do something else.

1116
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:54,400
Like start your own business. I don't
know. You're laughing at me right now.

1117
01:06:55,180 --> 01:06:56,860
He's 19.
He's got the whole war he's got,

1118
01:06:56,861 --> 01:07:00,730
he's got the world by the fucking short
hairs and all. Sounds. It all sounds good.

1119
01:07:00,820 --> 01:07:02,830
I was listening to a
podcast from wild back then.

1120
01:07:02,831 --> 01:07:05,830
You were shitting on the
NFL having games in London.

1121
01:07:06,070 --> 01:07:07,870
He said those games
are huge things for us.

1122
01:07:07,871 --> 01:07:09,670
European football fans
and believe it or not,

1123
01:07:09,671 --> 01:07:12,700
there are tons of football
fans here in Europe. Uh,

1124
01:07:12,701 --> 01:07:16,180
the Games always sell and I felt football
sells out there. Who knows? All right,

1125
01:07:16,181 --> 01:07:19,210
here's new. Who, whose, here's
the last one. I'm stuttering here.

1126
01:07:20,980 --> 01:07:25,420
Okay. Guess what? I just
time traveled in the podcast.

1127
01:07:26,230 --> 01:07:29,170
Let me give you a second to just wrap
your head around this because I know it's

1128
01:07:29,171 --> 01:07:30,490
always weird when this happens.

1129
01:07:30,970 --> 01:07:33,280
I actually finished out the
podcast with the lovely near,

1130
01:07:33,430 --> 01:07:37,120
but my fucking batteries wore
out and I didn't even notice.

1131
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:41,530
We had a nice debate. She
fucking trashed me. Ah,

1132
01:07:42,940 --> 01:07:47,920
what are you going to do? Um, so let me,
I don't even know where to pick up here.

1133
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:51,460
I've got two more reads to do and I think
I have another question. I'm not sure.

1134
01:07:51,461 --> 01:07:56,140
So let me, uh, all right.
Dollar Shave club, everybody.
I know this is fucking weird.

1135
01:07:56,141 --> 01:08:00,880
Sorry to just slam your fucking brain
against the inside of your skull there.

1136
01:08:01,420 --> 01:08:03,940
Um, all right. Dollar Shave Club.
It's Monday morning. Not by the way.

1137
01:08:04,030 --> 01:08:08,580
That's why twice sound a little
more fresh. No Yon and fro freckles.

1138
01:08:09,150 --> 01:08:10,420
All right to always shave club.

1139
01:08:11,470 --> 01:08:15,650
Dollar Shave club.com has a special
offer for new members who join today.

1140
01:08:15,890 --> 01:08:20,890
You'll get a free month of the executive
razor when you buy a tube of Dr calvers

1141
01:08:22,340 --> 01:08:26,480
. I got to, I'm going to say Carvey
for the Dr Covey's easy shave bad.

1142
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:30,050
Whenever I hear that executive razor,
I just pictures like, you know,

1143
01:08:30,051 --> 01:08:34,100
you have the dress shirt on with boxers
and then you'd dress socks with soc

1144
01:08:34,440 --> 01:08:38,630
artists. Just shaving with it.
I've got a fire. So more time.

1145
01:08:39,420 --> 01:08:39,710
All right.

1146
01:08:39,710 --> 01:08:43,990
This is the first time they've ever done
something like this and once you tried

1147
01:08:44,030 --> 01:08:46,070
dollar shave club.com you'll be,

1148
01:08:46,230 --> 01:08:49,070
you will become a proud member
like millions of others.

1149
01:08:49,100 --> 01:08:52,850
One reason is because they deliver amazing
razors right to your door for a third,

1150
01:08:52,880 --> 01:08:56,240
the price of what greedy
razor corporations charge.

1151
01:08:56,480 --> 01:09:01,240
That means when you join
DSC dollar shave club, um,

1152
01:09:01,310 --> 01:09:04,280
you can afford to shave with a
fresh blade anytime you want,

1153
01:09:04,281 --> 01:09:06,500
which feels fantastic.

1154
01:09:06,500 --> 01:09:10,280
You'll get a first class shave when you
use the executive blade without hurting

1155
01:09:10,281 --> 01:09:13,550
your wallet.
What Martin Shade.

1156
01:09:14,000 --> 01:09:18,890
You're looking at man or
didn't judge another man by
the size of it. I mean that,

1157
01:09:19,180 --> 01:09:22,550
that fucking Michael Douglas greed
is good movie Wall Street. All right.

1158
01:09:22,551 --> 01:09:27,551
Another reason is Dr Covey's easy shave
butter using it with the executive makes

1159
01:09:28,101 --> 01:09:31,280
the blade glide gently for
the smoothest shave ever.

1160
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,120
Dr Carver's shave butter isn't
your average shave cream.

1161
01:09:36,020 --> 01:09:39,230
It's a unique conditioning formula
with high quality natural ingredients,

1162
01:09:39,231 --> 01:09:43,400
leaving your skin unbelievably soft
and smooth. Jesus Christ. We got it.

1163
01:09:44,090 --> 01:09:48,860
How many times you can see how
smooth it is, like a baby's ass. Uh,

1164
01:09:48,890 --> 01:09:51,590
call to call to action.
And right now,

1165
01:09:52,220 --> 01:09:54,800
new members who buy a
tube of shave butter,

1166
01:09:54,801 --> 01:09:58,490
get the executive radio razor for free.
They've never done this before.

1167
01:09:58,491 --> 01:09:59,360
Take advantage of it.

1168
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:02,540
And it's only available by going
to dollar shave club.com/burr.

1169
01:10:02,810 --> 01:10:07,400
That's dollar shave club.com/bar
dollar shave club.com/berg.

1170
01:10:09,020 --> 01:10:11,600
Um, MVMT watches. All right,

1171
01:10:11,601 --> 01:10:15,140
it's been a few weeks since I cracked
open these sharp looking movement.

1172
01:10:15,141 --> 01:10:19,180
Watch for not, it's been a
couple of months. Stop putting
words in my mouth. MMM.

1173
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:21,410
All right.
As promised,

1174
01:10:21,411 --> 01:10:25,640
the quality's watches are there for an
awesome price in the style department.

1175
01:10:25,641 --> 01:10:30,620
The compliments I get on this thing are
really unbelievable considering I don't

1176
01:10:30,621 --> 01:10:34,190
wear it now I'm wearing it.
Describe your watch. Well,

1177
01:10:34,191 --> 01:10:36,140
I'm wearing the fucking
watch I always had,

1178
01:10:36,950 --> 01:10:41,480
cause I'm a grownup and I can afford a
watch because I spent 24 fucking years

1179
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:43,280
and strip malls.
I can actually afford one.

1180
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:46,520
But back in the day I'm gonna
Redo this copy. All right.

1181
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,800
When I couldn't afford a watch, when I
stayed in that broken bed, net fucked up,

1182
01:10:51,801 --> 01:10:54,230
cabin up and chill coot
Charlie's and Alaska,

1183
01:10:54,440 --> 01:10:57,170
I would have worn a watch like this and
they would have been like, God damn it,

1184
01:10:57,171 --> 01:11:00,830
this guy's a pro. I hope
they gave him a good bed. Um,

1185
01:11:00,831 --> 01:11:03,530
if you hadn't had the chance
to experience how movement, uh,

1186
01:11:03,560 --> 01:11:07,700
how a movement watch fits around your
wrists, this is your chance movement.

1187
01:11:07,701 --> 01:11:12,050
Watch watches start at just 95 bucks.
It looks like a $700 watch.

1188
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:12,943
I'm not going to let you,

1189
01:11:13,350 --> 01:11:17,580
she when movement cut out the middle
man with the huge big brand mark ups,

1190

finally got affordable.

1191
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:23,760
Imagine that a watch with a d with
department store quality for a fraction of

1192
01:11:23,761 --> 01:11:27,870
the price movement has grown organically

Christ. All right. Um, okay.

1215
01:12:42,091 --> 01:12:45,330
The last question that I actually did
with the lovely Nia and now we're fucking

1216
01:12:46,920 --> 01:12:47,880
wage gap myth.

1217
01:12:49,530 --> 01:12:49,610
MMM.

1218
01:12:49,610 --> 01:12:53,270
Oh, did this spark a debate
a deal? Dear Billy Baru,

1219
01:12:53,630 --> 01:12:56,660
I was one of the fortunate and
audience members of your epic terrorist

1220
01:12:56,661 --> 01:12:59,300
performance. You crushed it. My
opinion. Thank you very much.

1221
01:12:59,301 --> 01:13:01,220
He said the wage gap statistic.

1222
01:13:03,250 --> 01:13:03,310
MMM.

1223
01:13:03,310 --> 01:13:06,820
You said I wanted to debunk a myth for
you, the wage gap statistic. You know,

1224
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:10,720
there's this thing right now that
they say that a woman gets paid less,

1225
01:13:10,721 --> 01:13:14,020
79 cents less to do the exact
same job is a guy which you know,

1226
01:13:14,050 --> 01:13:16,690
my opinion is fucked up. The job
should pay what you pay. Right?

1227
01:13:17,110 --> 01:13:20,410
So this guy says the wage gap statistic
that you hear about all the time is

1228
01:13:20,411 --> 01:13:24,760
simply the average earnings of
men and women working full time.

1229
01:13:25,450 --> 01:13:28,900
It does not take into account
different job positions, hours worked,

1230
01:13:28,930 --> 01:13:32,080
or different jobs.
It has nothing to do with the same work.

1231
01:13:32,470 --> 01:13:35,620
It has nothing to do with discrimination.
In 1963,

1232
01:13:35,621 --> 01:13:37,780
the supreme court passed
the equal pay act,

1233
01:13:38,050 --> 01:13:41,260
which makes it illegal to pay
different wages for the same job.

1234
01:13:41,530 --> 01:13:44,080
If you still don't buy that,
then consider this.

1235
01:13:44,081 --> 01:13:47,170
If a company could legally
play pay women less money,

1236
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:50,170
do you think those greedy
cuts would ever hire a man?

1237
01:13:51,580 --> 01:13:55,900
Some decent points there. Uh, once I
pulled this wage gap threat thread,

1238
01:13:55,960 --> 01:13:58,600
a whole bunch of other feminists
myths started to unravel,

1239
01:13:58,601 --> 01:14:03,190
but I just wanted to shine a light on
this topic. Well, okay, lets you know,

1240
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:08,140
I'll have to look all of that up. I never
looked up the equal pay act, but um,

1241
01:14:09,490 --> 01:14:13,840
if they're still able to make the
numbers work then wouldn't that say,

1242
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:18,310
did guys get the better high
paying jobs then done then?

1243
01:14:18,311 --> 01:14:22,210
Does it become that? I'm
just asking. All right. Um,

1244
01:14:22,690 --> 01:14:24,290
that's what I would guess.
So I don't know.

1245
01:14:24,310 --> 01:14:27,400
Evidently I have some reading to do
and I think a lot of feminists do too,

1246
01:14:27,401 --> 01:14:30,160
that just jump on the bandwagon.
I'll look up the equal pay act.

1247
01:14:31,630 --> 01:14:32,463
MMM.

1248
01:14:32,880 --> 01:14:33,840
I don't know who the fuck knows.

1249
01:14:33,841 --> 01:14:36,850
I mean one of the dumbest fucking ways
to get somebody to listen to your goddamn

1250
01:14:36,900 --> 01:14:40,770
opinion is to just sit there and be like,
you got it better than us.

1251
01:14:41,040 --> 01:14:43,950
You're life is fucking easy.
That immediately puts the
other side going. Like,

1252
01:14:43,951 --> 01:14:48,840
you know, fuck you. Fuck you and your
procedure. You know, my fucking life. Cz,

1253
01:14:48,841 --> 01:14:50,700
I just dealt with this, this,
this and this. You know,

1254
01:14:50,701 --> 01:14:52,470
it just puts people into that mindset.

1255
01:14:53,930 --> 01:14:54,763
MMM.

1256
01:14:55,980 --> 01:14:58,920
I Dunno if that whole fucking yelling
and screaming and shit. You know,

1257
01:14:58,950 --> 01:15:02,880
believe me as a yeller and Screamer, I
know it doesn't make people listen to you.

1258
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:06,120
It just makes you, people
just go, oh my God,

1259
01:15:06,121 --> 01:15:09,030
I want to get away from this person
or that person's a fucking lunatic.

1260
01:15:09,360 --> 01:15:12,090
That's been my experience
trying to convey ideas

1261
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:16,590
since I was a little orange headed child.

1262
01:15:18,110 --> 01:15:18,943
MMM.

1263
01:15:18,950 --> 01:15:21,740
I don't know what's going on.
Okay. At the end of the day,

1264
01:15:21,860 --> 01:15:26,030
people show that the job should pay what
the job pays and the best person should

1265
01:15:26,031 --> 01:15:26,600
get it.

1266
01:15:26,600 --> 01:15:31,550
But sadly that is never going to happen
because there's always going to be the

1267
01:15:32,030 --> 01:15:34,370
boss's son.
There's always going to be the hot chick.

1268
01:15:34,460 --> 01:15:37,040
There's always going to be the racist,
the homophobe,

1269
01:15:37,041 --> 01:15:40,940
the person who comes in with the southern
accent, you're up north or vice versa,

1270
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:44,390
and somebody mentally still fighting the
war or think southern people are stupid.

1271
01:15:44,750 --> 01:15:48,920
You keep, the only way to take the
human element out of it is to gradually,

1272
01:15:48,921 --> 01:15:53,630
slowly but surely dumbed down human
beings make everything automated and you

1273
01:15:53,631 --> 01:15:57,110
slowly replace them with
free thinking robots,

1274
01:15:57,320 --> 01:16:00,020
which is basically what's going to happen.
By free thinking.

1275
01:16:00,021 --> 01:16:05,021
I mean they agree with the upper 1% and
not even the upper 1% the upper 1% of

1276
01:16:05,481 --> 01:16:10,240
the 1% that doesn't even show
up. You know, there's a lot of,

1277
01:16:10,270 --> 01:16:12,950
remember all the blue blood money and
everybody kind of knew how much money they

1278
01:16:12,951 --> 01:16:17,020
had and now they all say that, oh
they gave away a lot. You know,

1279
01:16:17,021 --> 01:16:20,890
the Rockerfellers or you know, they,
their fortune is in what it's worth.

1280
01:16:21,010 --> 01:16:25,480
They used to be the Vanderbilts that
are only worth like $75 million. Now.

1281
01:16:25,481 --> 01:16:26,410
I mean that's,
I don't know,

1282
01:16:27,220 --> 01:16:30,130
there's all these stories out there that
there's families that are so fucking

1283
01:16:30,131 --> 01:16:34,060
big and powerful are above any sort
of borders and they fucking, you know,

1284
01:16:34,240 --> 01:16:36,100
when they traveled by yet,
it's only like,

1285
01:16:36,280 --> 01:16:39,610
it's like their little navy and they just,
it's,

1286
01:16:39,770 --> 01:16:41,890
I'd love conspiracy theory
and they just float around.

1287
01:16:42,700 --> 01:16:46,090
They pull up to the dock and the comp
countries just come out and give them bags

1288
01:16:46,091 --> 01:16:49,870
of gold and then they just disappear.
It's like waterworld except you know,

1289
01:16:49,871 --> 01:16:53,480
without the uh, you know, on set,

1290
01:16:53,500 --> 01:16:56,830
they still have all the amenities cause
the world hasn't flooded over yet.

1291
01:16:56,950 --> 01:17:01,120
Does that make any sense? You know, I
think that's a good spot to stop is any,

1292
01:17:05,020 --> 01:17:08,560
uh, my apologies for a fucking
up the podcast this week. Um,

1293
01:17:09,560 --> 01:17:12,870
you guys have a nice couple
of fucking days and um,

1294
01:17:13,070 --> 01:17:16,610
can I end on some more drum nerd shit.
I told you my uh,

1295
01:17:16,910 --> 01:17:20,570
drum teachers taken me
through, um, that sting album,

1296
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,590
10 summers tails would have that has
the great Vinnie call Uda on it and how

1297
01:17:25,220 --> 01:17:26,810
they played in all these odd times,

1298
01:17:26,811 --> 01:17:30,950
but they wanted to imply for four times
and he finally taught me on that seven

1299
01:17:30,951 --> 01:17:34,040
days, which is in five, which I love. Uh,

1300
01:17:34,190 --> 01:17:36,290
he finally wrote out what he
was doing on the high yet,

1301
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:39,920
which is basically he's playing
that it's four, four against five.

1302
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:41,180
He's playing five underneath,

1303
01:17:41,181 --> 01:17:45,290
but he's implying four in the high hat
and a after all these fucking years of

1304
01:17:45,291 --> 01:17:47,090
trying to figure out how to do it.
He finally,

1305
01:17:47,091 --> 01:17:49,580
he just wrote out one line
of it and now it makes sense

1306
01:17:51,260 --> 01:17:54,200
to me and it's basically on the high hat.

1307
01:17:54,860 --> 01:17:59,690
I just still count in five.
But you just count,

1308
01:18:00,530 --> 01:18:04,820
you know, underneath if, if you listen to
it, you count one, two, three, four, five,

1309
01:18:04,850 --> 01:18:09,380
one, two, three, four, five
bumped, one dent that fucking shit.

1310
01:18:09,590 --> 01:18:10,610
But on top,

1311
01:18:11,720 --> 01:18:15,290
how it works for me is you just,
you just,

1312
01:18:15,800 --> 01:18:20,210
I still counted five. I
just, you're thrown in. He
counted is like eighth notes,

1313
01:18:20,211 --> 01:18:25,211
so one and two and three and four and
five and one and two and three and four

1314
01:18:25,251 --> 01:18:29,000
and five and the first time
through you accent one,

1315
01:18:29,030 --> 01:18:33,540
three and five and the second time
through you accent to in four.

1316
01:18:34,340 --> 01:18:37,310
Try that. That's the way I've
been doing it. But granted,

1317
01:18:37,311 --> 01:18:39,590
this is massively filtered down

1318
01:18:42,260 --> 01:18:47,090
from a professional drummer to a stand
up comedian who cannot read out loud.

1319
01:18:48,140 --> 01:18:52,340
Um, all right, that's it. Go fuck
yourselves. I'll talk to you on Thursday.

1320
01:18:52,370 --> 01:18:54,230
I'll check in on you.
All right.
