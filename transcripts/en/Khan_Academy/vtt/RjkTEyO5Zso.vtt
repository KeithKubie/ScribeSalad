00:00:00.520 --> 00:00:03.800
In this video, I want to show
some examples of graphing

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.620
quadratic functions.

00:00:05.620 --> 00:00:08.790
But before I do that, I want
to make one fairly minor

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:11.260
correction to the end of the
last video where we did some

00:00:11.260 --> 00:00:12.880
factoring with grouping.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:17.350
When I showed you the proof of
why that works, I multiplied

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:24.180
fx plus g times hx plus j.

00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:27.020
When I multiplied them, I
did the first term, I

00:00:27.020 --> 00:00:29.280
said fx times hx.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:32.530
When I did it in the last
video, I just wrote fhx.

00:00:32.530 --> 00:00:34.980
And we know that that's not
true, we have f times h

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.050
times x times x.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.950
It's fhx squared.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:43.690
That times that is fhx squared
and then the rest of it I had

00:00:43.690 --> 00:00:51.200
gotten right, it's fx times j,
so plus we get fjx and then we

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.110
had g times hx so we could
write that as plus ghx.

00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:00.300
And then finally g times
j, which gives us gj.

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:03.330
So I apologize for that error,
I had forgotten to write the

00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.660
exponent there and I think I'd
forgotten to write it in the

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:08.580
step after that, but it didn't
change the argument for the

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.370
proof, I at least didn't
mess up there.

00:01:10.370 --> 00:01:12.810
So I just want to make that
quick correction in case that

00:01:12.810 --> 00:01:13.635
confused anyone.

00:01:13.635 --> 00:01:16.340
And I also made a small
annotation in that video if

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.890
you're watching it on YouTube.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.130
With that out of the way, let's
learn to graph some of

00:01:21.130 --> 00:01:23.260
these quadratic functions.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:28.020
So let's say I have the function
y is equal to x

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:32.820
squared minus 2x minus 8.

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:34.910
And what we're going to do is
we're going to rewrite this

00:01:34.910 --> 00:01:36.860
quadratic expression on
the right-hand side.

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.410
We're going to write it
in intercept form.

00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:40.860
That essentially means
just writing it

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.470
in it factored form.

00:01:42.470 --> 00:01:45.390
Then doing that, we're able to
figure out the x-intercept,

00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:47.950
where we're intersecting the
x-access, and then using that

00:01:47.950 --> 00:01:49.370
we'll be able to figure
out the vertex.

00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:51.110
And I'll show you you what the
vertex is in a second.

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:53.800
So let's just factor
this quadratic on

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:54.680
the right-hand side.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:58.720
So we get y is equal to-- so
what are two numbers where

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:01.090
their product is a negative 8,
so they're going to have

00:02:01.090 --> 00:02:05.310
different signs and then their
difference is negative 2?

00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:09.889
Let's see, if we have a negative
4, and plus 2.

00:02:09.889 --> 00:02:12.915
When you take the product, you
get negative 8, when you add

00:02:12.915 --> 00:02:16.160
them, you get negative 2.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:21.010
So we could rewrite y as being
equal to x minus 4

00:02:21.010 --> 00:02:25.090
times x plus 2.

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.910
So this is essentially writing
this quadratic function in

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:29.490
intercept form.

00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.870
And now let's figure out where
this intersects the x-axis So

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:34.580
let me label my axis.

00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:38.210
This is, of course, the x-axis,
that is the y-axis.

00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:40.580
So when will something
intersect the x-axis?

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:44.090
The x-axis is when y is
equal to 0, right?

00:02:44.090 --> 00:02:46.270
So let's set this equal to 0.

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:52.390
0 is equal to x minus
4 times x plus 2.

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.690
We've seen this multiple times
before, this means that either

00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:00.500
x minus 4 or x plus 2 or both of
them have to be equal to 0.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.490
So x minus four is equal to 0
or x plus two is equal to 0.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:08.670
So that means x could be equal
to 4-- we're just adding 4 to

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.790
both sides of that equation--
or subtracting 2 from both

00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:17.230
sides of this equation, x could
be equal to negative 2.

00:03:17.230 --> 00:03:21.350
So these points where we
intersect, when x is 4, this

00:03:21.350 --> 00:03:23.840
term is 0 so the whole
thing is 0.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.390
That's how we solved for this.

00:03:25.390 --> 00:03:31.850
So the points 4, 0, and the
point 2, 0 are going to both

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.030
be on this parabola.

00:03:33.030 --> 00:03:34.510
So let's graph them.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:41.280
So 4, 0-- let me do this in a
darker color-- 1, 2 3, 4,

00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:44.210
that's 4, 0.

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.810
And then the other point
is negative 2, 0.

00:03:46.810 --> 00:03:51.200
1, 2 negative 2, 0
is right there.

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:55.960
So that's the two points where
we intersect the x-axis.

00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:57.900
And now we're going to determine
something called the

00:03:57.900 --> 00:03:59.980
vertex of our parabola.

00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:05.400
And the vertex, just to give you
a sneak preview, parabolas

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:08.930
are the graphs of quadratic
functions and so the graphic

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:11.740
is going to look either like an
upward u or a downward u,

00:04:11.740 --> 00:04:13.760
and it's going to be shifted
around on this.

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.839
But the vertex is either
this minimum point or

00:04:16.839 --> 00:04:18.110
this maximum point.

00:04:18.110 --> 00:04:21.750
And the word parabola just
describes this function shape.

00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:25.090
It's the shape of the graph
of a quadratic.

00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:27.560
Let me write that word down,
these are parabolas.

00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:34.045
So to figure out the vertex,
you actually just take the

00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:37.520
x-value that's halfway in
between the two intercepts.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:40.700
No matter what, the intercepts
are going to be equidistant

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:41.950
from the vertex.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:47.980
So if that is the graph, those
would be our intercepts and

00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.300
then our vertex is going to be
an x-value exactly halfway

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.520
between them.

00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:57.620
So to figure out the x-value of
our vertex, we just average

00:04:57.620 --> 00:05:01.330
these two x-values of
our x-intercepts.

00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:02.770
So let's do that.

00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:08.250
We could say the x for the
vertex, let's call that x for

00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:10.910
the vertex-- that's why I wrote
a v there-- is going to

00:05:10.910 --> 00:05:12.840
be equal to the average
of these.

00:05:12.840 --> 00:05:16.290
So 4 plus negative 2 over 2.

00:05:16.290 --> 00:05:20.810
Which is equal to this 4 minus
2, which is 2 over

00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:22.590
2 is equal to 1.

00:05:22.590 --> 00:05:25.540
So x is going to be equal
to 1 and what is y when

00:05:25.540 --> 00:05:26.970
x is equal to 1?

00:05:26.970 --> 00:05:31.480
So the y for the vertex is
going to be equal to 1

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:36.500
squared-- I'll just write that
as 1-- minus 2 times 1, so

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.800
minus 2, minus 8.

00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.510
So what is this?

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:45.230
This is 1 minus 10, which
is equal to negative 9.

00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.090
So the vertex is going to be
at the point 1, negative 9.

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:52.830
So we go one and then
we go down nine.

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:56.010
So x is 1 and then
y is negative 9.

00:05:56.010 --> 00:06:00.860
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.

00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:03.010
So it's right there.

00:06:03.010 --> 00:06:06.010
And so if we were to graph this
parabola, the line of

00:06:06.010 --> 00:06:08.330
symmetry is on the x-value
of the vertex.

00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:11.680
So, I want to be doing it in
a darker color than that.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:17.280
So the graph should be symmetric
around x is equal to

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.000
1, and the graph will look
something like this.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.300
I'll try my best to draw it.

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:22.555
Bam!

00:06:22.555 --> 00:06:24.990
It'll intersect the x-axis
there, it'll be symmetric,

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:27.940
it'll look just like that
on the other side.

00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:30.950
And it'll go bam,
just like that.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:32.660
I think you get the
general idea.

00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:34.620
And then the other point that
you may or may not be

00:06:34.620 --> 00:06:36.760
interested in is the
actual y-intercept.

00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.250
If x is equal to 0, you
immediately see that y is

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.280
equal to negative 8.

00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:44.270
So the point 0, negative 8
should also be on this graph.

00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:45.510
Let's see if I drew it right.

00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:50.520
0, negative eight right there
should also be on that graph.

00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:51.770
Let's do another one of these.

00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:57.810
I'm kind of taking up some
of the space for the next

00:06:57.810 --> 00:07:01.110
problem, so let me clear this.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.200
Let's do another one.

00:07:03.200 --> 00:07:04.550
All right.

00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:14.170
So let's say we have y is
equal to 2x squared

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:20.510
plus 6x plus 4.

00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:23.150
So here, the thing that
immediately jumps out at me is

00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:24.860
that I can factor a 2
out of everything.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:29.210
So I could rewrite this as y is
equal to 2 times x squared

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:32.080
plus 3x plus 2.

00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:35.170
That saves me the pain of having
to do the factoring by

00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:37.500
grouping that we talked about
in the last video.

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:39.830
And this we can factor in a
pretty straightforward way.

00:07:39.830 --> 00:07:47.330
This is 2 times 1 is 2, 2 plus
1 is 3, so this is x plus 2

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.220
times x plus 1, right?

00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:53.590
2 plus 1 is 3, 2 times 1 is 2.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:55.710
So that's what y is equal to.

00:07:55.710 --> 00:08:00.500
So if we wanted to know the
x-intercepts, we figure out

00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:03.880
where this expression is equal
to 0, so we said 0 is equal to

00:08:03.880 --> 00:08:08.180
2 times x plus 2
times x plus 1.

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:10.150
Remember, we want to figure
out where we intercept the

00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:12.020
x-axis, that's the
x-axis there.

00:08:12.020 --> 00:08:14.250
Y is 0 on the x-axis.

00:08:18.710 --> 00:08:20.050
So let's get back
to this problem.

00:08:20.050 --> 00:08:25.220
So either of these can
be equal to 0.

00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:28.170
Obviously the 2 can't be equal
to 0, so we get the situation

00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:34.510
where x minus x plus 2 is equal
to 0 or x plus 1 is

00:08:34.510 --> 00:08:35.190
equal to 0.

00:08:35.190 --> 00:08:37.110
I didn't have to write the
parentheses there.

00:08:37.110 --> 00:08:39.890
Subtract 2 from both sides of
this equation, we get x is

00:08:39.890 --> 00:08:41.340
equal to negative 2.

00:08:41.340 --> 00:08:45.250
Subtract 1 from both sides of
this question or x could be

00:08:45.250 --> 00:08:47.650
equal to negative 1.

00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:50.740
So the point negative 2, 0.

00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:52.930
You put negative 2 here, this
is obviously going to make y

00:08:52.930 --> 00:08:59.300
equal to 0 and the point
negative 1, 0, same argument.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:01.050
Those are our x-intercepts.

00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:02.230
Let me graph it.

00:09:02.230 --> 00:09:07.340
We have negative 2,
0 right there.

00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:10.120
Actually let me do this graph
a little bit bigger.

00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:13.900
Let's say that this is right
here is-- let me label it-- in

00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:15.120
double steps.

00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:18.050
So let's say this is negative 1,
let's say this is negative

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:28.200
2, that is negative 3,
1, 2, this is our 3.

00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.640
It's a 1, 2, 3 just like that,
negative 1, negative 2,

00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.800
negative 3.

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.390
So, I'm using two blocks
to represent one.

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:39.900
So the point negative 2, 0
is on our graph, with our

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:42.570
x-intercept, so negative
2, 0 is right there.

00:09:42.570 --> 00:09:46.200
And then we have negative 1,
0, which is right there.

00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:49.330
And then we want to figure
out the vertex.

00:09:49.330 --> 00:09:51.900
Well, the vertex is going to be
the average of those two,

00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.330
so the x for the vertex is going
to be negative 2 plus

00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:59.940
negative 1 over 2, that's
negative 3/2 which is the same

00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:02.590
thing is negative 1.5.

00:10:02.590 --> 00:10:05.720
Now what is y equal to when
x is negative 1.5?

00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:07.270
This is going to be a
little bit involved.

00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:09.000
I'll use actual 3/2.

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:18.390
So so we get y is equal to 2
times negative 3/2 squared

00:10:18.390 --> 00:10:23.720
plus 6 times negative
3/2 plus 4.

00:10:23.720 --> 00:10:26.310
And let us figure this out.

00:10:26.310 --> 00:10:32.090
So this is equal to 2 times 9
over 4 minus-- you have that

00:10:32.090 --> 00:10:34.950
negative sign there-- and then
we could make this 6 divided

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:37.720
by 2 is just the same
thing is 3/1.

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.890
So this is minus 9,
3 times 3 plus 4.

00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:49.930
This 2/4 the same thing as
1/2, so this becomes 9/2

00:10:49.930 --> 00:10:52.820
minus 9 plus 4.

00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:54.240
So let's simplify this.

00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:59.290
Minus 9 plus 4 is the same
thing as minus 5, right?

00:10:59.290 --> 00:11:00.990
Minus 9 plus 4.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.010
Minus 5 we can rewrite is
equal to minus 10/2.

00:11:06.010 --> 00:11:11.520
9 minus 10, all of that
over 2, is minus 1/2.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:17.390
So, our vertex of this parabola
is the point minus

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:21.250
1.5 or negative 1.5,
negative 1/2.

00:11:21.250 --> 00:11:24.980
This is our vertex, so we
can graph it right here.

00:11:24.980 --> 00:11:28.240
Negative 1.5, negative
1/2, our vertex

00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:30.480
is right over there.

00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.100
And then we can a graph
this parabola.

00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:33.850
If we want to do the
y-intercept, we can.

00:11:33.850 --> 00:11:37.120
The y-intercept is going
to be here when x is 0,

00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:38.190
y is equal to 4.

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.720
These terms cancel out.

00:11:39.720 --> 00:11:45.120
X is 0, y is 1, 2, 3,
4 right over there.

00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:47.100
And then we can graph
this parabola.

00:11:47.100 --> 00:11:53.030
It will look like that, that's
my best, it should be

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:58.720
symmetric around x-coordinate of
the vertex just like that.

00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:01.480
Let's do one more of these.

00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:03.920
And, once again, I've used all
my real estate up, let me

00:12:03.920 --> 00:12:06.310
clear this out of the way.

00:12:06.310 --> 00:12:07.760
Let's do one more.

00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:14.130
Let's say that I have y is equal
to negative x squared

00:12:14.130 --> 00:12:16.640
plus 10x minus 21.

00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:19.290
Once again, let's write this
in intercept form, we just

00:12:19.290 --> 00:12:20.940
factor the right-hand side.

00:12:20.940 --> 00:12:23.276
We get y is equal to-- well the
first thing I want to do

00:12:23.276 --> 00:12:26.580
is it is factor this negative
1 out-- negative 1 times x

00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.770
squared minus 10x plus 21.

00:12:30.770 --> 00:12:33.400
Now what two numbers, when
I multiply them, they're

00:12:33.400 --> 00:12:34.550
positive 21?

00:12:34.550 --> 00:12:36.860
So they have to be the same
side, and when I add them I

00:12:36.860 --> 00:12:38.080
get negative 10.

00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:41.130
At least in my brain, negative
7 and negative 3 jump out.

00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:44.390
I mean, there's not that many
factors of 21, so 7 and 3 are

00:12:44.390 --> 00:12:47.630
probably two that usually jump
out because they add to 10.

00:12:47.630 --> 00:12:52.590
So you have y is equal to
negative 1 times x minus 3

00:12:52.590 --> 00:12:54.920
times x minus 7.

00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:58.590
Negative 3 plus negative 7 is
negative 10, negative 3 times

00:12:58.590 --> 00:13:01.500
negative 7 is positive 21.

00:13:01.500 --> 00:13:04.280
So if you want to find the
x-intecepts, the x-intercepts

00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.390
are going to be where-- so we
could set this whole equation

00:13:07.390 --> 00:13:12.400
equal to 0, negative 1 times x
minus 3 times x minus 7 are

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:15.900
x-intercepts or the x-values
that make y equal to 0 are

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:20.090
either the ones that make x
minus 3 equal to 0 or the

00:13:20.090 --> 00:13:23.100
x-values that make x
minus 7 equal to 0.

00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:25.660
Add 3 to both sides of this
equation, you got x is equal

00:13:25.660 --> 00:13:29.940
to 3, add 7 to both sides of
this equation, you get x is

00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:30.830
equal to 7.

00:13:30.830 --> 00:13:35.150
So so we get our two
x-intercepts, the point 3, 0--

00:13:35.150 --> 00:13:44.440
1, 2, 3, 0-- and the point 7,
0-- 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7-- 0.

00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.790
Now, we know that our vertex
is going to be right in

00:13:46.790 --> 00:13:47.830
between them.

00:13:47.830 --> 00:13:53.000
So the x for the vertex is going
to be 3 plus 7 over 2,

00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.130
which is equal to 10/2,
which is equal to 5.

00:13:56.130 --> 00:14:00.370
And to the y-value, let's
figure it out, y for our

00:14:00.370 --> 00:14:07.540
vertex going to be negative 5
squared, so negative 25 plus

00:14:07.540 --> 00:14:14.080
10 times 5 plus 50 minus 21.

00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:14.850
So what is this?

00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:20.380
This is equal to-- we have a
negative 25 and negative 21,

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:23.680
you add those together you
get a negative 46.

00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.780
Add that to 50, you get
y is equal to 4.

00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:32.450
So the vertex is at 5, 4.

00:14:32.450 --> 00:14:37.070
Let me graph that, the
vertex is 5, 4.

00:14:37.070 --> 00:14:40.160
So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, right
in between.

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:43.610
And then up four, 1, 2, 3, 4.

00:14:43.610 --> 00:14:46.940
So notice something, in this
graph over here, the last two

00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.240
graphs, actually I think I just
cleared them, you saw

00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:53.810
that the vertex was
below the x-axis.

00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:57.450
So, when we plotted the
x-intercept and then the

00:14:57.450 --> 00:15:01.590
vertex, the upward-forming
u-shape was the only option.

00:15:01.590 --> 00:15:05.810
But here, the only option
is a downward u-shape.

00:15:05.810 --> 00:15:08.460
This being either the minimum or
maximum point and going for

00:15:08.460 --> 00:15:11.200
both of these points and having
a u-shape, our u-shape

00:15:11.200 --> 00:15:15.450
is going to have to look
something like this.

00:15:15.450 --> 00:15:20.180
Now,-- let me draw that little
bit better-- the u is going to

00:15:20.180 --> 00:15:23.530
have to look something
like that.

00:15:23.530 --> 00:15:26.070
That's a better shot at it.

00:15:26.070 --> 00:15:29.100
Now notice what was the
difference between this

00:15:29.100 --> 00:15:31.240
equation and the
previous ones?

00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:34.580
The difference was is that this
one had a negative in

00:15:34.580 --> 00:15:36.100
front of the x squared.

00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:37.850
The coefficient in front
of the x squared

00:15:37.850 --> 00:15:39.970
was a negative number.

00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:43.190
And that's why we have kind of
a downward opening parabola.

00:15:43.190 --> 00:15:47.130
If this was a positive number,
we would have an

00:15:47.130 --> 00:15:48.380
upward-opening parabola.

00:15:48.380 --> 00:15:50.760
So that's why this one is kind
of a downward shape and its

00:15:50.760 --> 00:15:53.140
vertex represents
a maximum point.

00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.310
It's the highest point
on the parabola.

00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:57.840
In the previous videos, we had
an upward opening, or in the

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.330
previous problems, with an
upward-opening parabola and

00:16:01.330 --> 00:16:03.930
our vertex was the
minimum point.
