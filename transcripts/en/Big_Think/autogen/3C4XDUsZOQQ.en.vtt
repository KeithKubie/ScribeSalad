00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:26.610
had a different way different ideas to
 

00:00:26.610 --> 00:00:28.580

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:31.650
and he said no I ended up leaving that
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.799
and he said no I ended up leaving that
job because I thought the gatekeeper was

00:00:33.799 --> 00:00:33.809
job because I thought the gatekeeper was
 

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:35.630
job because I thought the gatekeeper was
standing in my way and what I came to

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
standing in my way and what I came to
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.459
standing in my way and what I came to
realize is that gatekeepers exist

00:00:37.459 --> 00:00:37.469
realize is that gatekeepers exist
 

00:00:37.469 --> 00:00:39.319
realize is that gatekeepers exist
everywhere they're probably even in our

00:00:39.319 --> 00:00:39.329
everywhere they're probably even in our
 

00:00:39.329 --> 00:00:41.509

own heads sometimes where we just say we

00:00:41.509 --> 00:00:41.519
own heads sometimes where we just say we
 

00:00:41.519 --> 00:00:43.430

can't do it and so out of that

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:43.440
can't do it and so out of that
 

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:44.989
can't do it and so out of that
experience I realized there were a lot

00:00:44.989 --> 00:00:44.999
experience I realized there were a lot
 

00:00:44.999 --> 00:00:46.880
experience I realized there were a lot
of ways I could have kept going back and

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:46.890
of ways I could have kept going back and

of ways I could have kept going back and
trying a different approach with the

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:49.260
trying a different approach with the
 

00:00:49.260 --> 00:00:51.829
trying a different approach with the
gatekeeper and I learned that with other

00:00:51.829 --> 00:00:51.839
gatekeeper and I learned that with other
 

00:00:51.839 --> 00:00:54.559
gatekeeper and I learned that with other
gatekeepers and that no is not yet so

00:00:54.559 --> 00:00:54.569
gatekeepers and that no is not yet so
 

00:00:54.569 --> 00:00:55.939
gatekeepers and that no is not yet so
just because you hear no the first time

00:00:55.939 --> 00:00:55.949
just because you hear no the first time
 

00:00:55.949 --> 00:00:59.360

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
learn like no perhaps as an invitation
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.710
learn like no perhaps as an invitation
an invitation to come back again to try

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:30.720
an invitation to come back again to try
 

00:01:30.720 --> 00:01:33.320

where I felt like I needed at least
 

00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.540
where I felt like I needed at least
three times to go back with the idea

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:41.550
three times to go back with the idea
 

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:44.090
three times to go back with the idea
what I learned is two things one is I'm

00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:44.100
what I learned is two things one is I'm
 

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:46.640
what I learned is two things one is I'm
testing the idea myself I'm trying to

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:46.650
testing the idea myself I'm trying to
 

00:01:46.650 --> 00:01:48.320

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:02.120
you you're testing their passion for it
you're testing how good an idea they

00:02:02.120 --> 00:02:02.130
you're testing how good an idea they
 

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.190
you're testing how good an idea they
think it is because if somebody's

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:04.200
think it is because if somebody's
 

00:02:04.200 --> 00:02:05.630
think it is because if somebody's
pitching you an idea but they're not

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
pitching you an idea but they're not
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:07.850

that excited about it you're counting on
them to go forward so I think this idea

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:10.590
them to go forward so I think this idea
 

00:02:10.590 --> 00:02:12.890
them to go forward so I think this idea
of no is not yet is a resiliency test

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
of no is not yet is a resiliency test
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.690
