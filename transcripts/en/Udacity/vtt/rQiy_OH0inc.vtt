00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.614
Let's look at these numbers again for a second. Remember that,looking for

00:00:03.614 --> 00:00:07.694
patterns and making educated guesses about what's going on. And then, figuring

00:00:07.694 --> 00:00:13.203
out if those guesses are right or wrong is really what math is all about. So,

00:00:13.203 --> 00:00:18.052
why do we have 1 plus x here? And why do we have 2 plus x here? Let's look at a

00:00:18.052 --> 00:00:23.671
new log for a second. Log base 10 of 3, and I'm going to tell you right now,

00:00:23.671 --> 00:00:29.372
this is about equal to 0.47712. Just to make it perfectly clear that this is

00:00:29.372 --> 00:00:33.726
rounded, I'm going to change this to an about equal sign. Now, using what log

00:00:33.726 --> 00:00:37.986
base 10 of 3 is about equal to, what do you think we can get for log base 10 of

00:00:37.986 --> 00:00:44.024
30 and log base 10 of 300? First, using the idea that you came up with before,

00:00:44.024 --> 00:00:48.924
I'd like you to make a guess about what each of these is equal to. Then use a

00:00:48.924 --> 00:00:53.774
calculator to get the actual answer, and round to 5 decimal places. You won't

00:00:53.774 --> 00:00:57.630
be graded on your guesses so just try it out. Then I'd like you to also

00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:02.988
consider what log this 10 of 3000 is. And then lastly how about log based 10 of

00:01:02.988 --> 00:01:07.871
3 million? Just so you know this is equal to log base 10 of 3 times 10 to the 6

00:01:07.871 --> 00:01:11.969
. So make your guesses and then check them with a calculator.
