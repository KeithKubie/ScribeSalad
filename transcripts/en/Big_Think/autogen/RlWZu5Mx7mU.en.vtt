definitely growing up words and that is
just undeniable so where is the cryptic

00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:18.810
just undeniable so where is the cryptic
 

00:01:18.810 --> 00:01:21.370
just undeniable so where is the cryptic
tipping point well you know there is a

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:21.380

general acceptance in the scientific

00:01:25.010 --> 00:01:25.020

yes oxygen is is the is the cryptic

00:01:37.130 --> 00:01:37.140
yes oxygen is is the is the cryptic
 

00:01:37.140 --> 00:01:39.020
yes oxygen is is the is the cryptic
tipping point and that we are presently

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:39.030
tipping point and that we are presently
 

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.719
tipping point and that we are presently
at 430 and that we're growing at a rate

00:01:41.719 --> 00:01:41.729
at 430 and that we're growing at a rate
 

00:01:41.729 --> 00:01:43.399
at 430 and that we're growing at a rate
of about two parts per million per year

00:01:43.399 --> 00:01:43.409
of about two parts per million per year
 

00:01:43.409 --> 00:01:48.289
of about two parts per million per year
so this would put us at about 250 2050

00:01:48.289 --> 00:01:48.299
so this would put us at about 250 2050
 

00:01:48.299 --> 00:01:51.830
so this would put us at about 250 2050
as a place where if we were to exceed

as a place where if we were to exceed
 

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.440
as a place where if we were to exceed
250 parts per million we would not be

250 parts per million we would not be

250 parts per million we would not be

able the increase in changes would be of
such consequences that that we would be

such consequences that that we would be
 

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.899
such consequences that that we would be
thrown into an irreversible and
