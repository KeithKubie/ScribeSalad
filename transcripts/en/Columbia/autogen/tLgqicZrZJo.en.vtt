hear the word containment and that seems

00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:48.950
hear the word containment and that seems
 

00:45:48.950 --> 00:45:51.759
hear the word containment and that seems
to make sense and could I have the next

00:45:51.759 --> 00:45:51.769
to make sense and could I have the next
 

00:45:51.769 --> 00:45:57.640
