00:00:14.587 --> 00:00:16.179
So as an astronomer,

00:00:16.179 --> 00:00:18.584
when I look at the sky with other people,

00:00:18.584 --> 00:00:19.541
they always ask me,

00:00:19.541 --> 00:00:21.488
"What is your favorite place in the universe?

00:00:21.488 --> 00:00:22.603
What is your favorite galaxy?

00:00:22.603 --> 00:00:24.585
What is your favorite planet?"

00:00:24.585 --> 00:00:27.249
My answer is

00:00:27.249 --> 00:00:28.667
Earth. That's right.

00:00:28.667 --> 00:00:30.710
This is a very special place, even for an astronomer.

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.223
We look at a lot of places,

00:00:32.223 --> 00:00:34.739
but there's only one that we know of in the whole universe

00:00:34.739 --> 00:00:36.072
that we can live on.

00:00:36.072 --> 00:00:37.213
It's an amazing planet,

00:00:37.213 --> 00:00:39.209
there is an amazing number of things happening,

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:41.676
some of them, you are hearing about it today.

00:00:41.676 --> 00:00:43.246
That's the only place in the universe

00:00:43.246 --> 00:00:44.814
where we know that there is life,

00:00:44.814 --> 00:00:46.513
so that makes it extremely special.

00:00:46.513 --> 00:00:47.758
What I'm going to talk to you about

00:00:47.758 --> 00:00:50.370
is this great adventure in astronomy that is happening

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:52.622
where we are actually actively looking

00:00:52.622 --> 00:00:53.988
for other places like this.

00:00:53.988 --> 00:00:56.628
It's impossible to imagine the number of possibilities,

00:00:56.628 --> 00:00:58.662
what happens on those other planets

00:00:58.662 --> 00:01:00.169
that can be habitable.

00:01:00.169 --> 00:01:02.836
So that's what I'm going to tell you about.

00:01:02.836 --> 00:01:04.756
So, the first thing we have to think of

00:01:04.756 --> 00:01:07.265
is, well, what makes a planet habitable?

00:01:07.265 --> 00:01:08.528
And, the easiest thing to do

00:01:08.528 --> 00:01:10.404
is to look at our own solar system.

00:01:10.404 --> 00:01:11.895
We have multiple examples.

00:01:11.895 --> 00:01:14.095
The first thing we learn is that size matters.

00:01:14.095 --> 00:01:16.153
We can't have a planet that's too small or too big.

00:01:16.153 --> 00:01:17.674
If we look at a planet that is too small,

00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:19.252
it doesn't have an atmosphere.

00:01:19.252 --> 00:01:21.173
The moon, technically not a planet,

00:01:21.173 --> 00:01:22.442
but a good example for this,

00:01:22.442 --> 00:01:23.093
is too small,

00:01:23.093 --> 00:01:24.483
it doesn't hold an atmosphere.

00:01:24.483 --> 00:01:27.133
Jupiter - very, very big -

00:01:27.133 --> 00:01:29.398
and it actually is mostly composed of gas,

00:01:29.398 --> 00:01:31.017
it has no surface you can stand on.

00:01:31.017 --> 00:01:32.972
The Earth is just right.

00:01:32.972 --> 00:01:34.318
The second thing that we learned

00:01:34.318 --> 00:01:35.655
is that the planet has to be

00:01:35.655 --> 00:01:37.557
at the right distance from its star.

00:01:37.557 --> 00:01:39.259
If the planet is too close to its star,

00:01:39.259 --> 00:01:40.357
it's too hot.

00:01:40.357 --> 00:01:41.727
That's the case for Venus.

00:01:41.727 --> 00:01:44.404
Here I have a picture that was taken by a spacecraft

00:01:44.404 --> 00:01:45.572
that landed on Venus,

00:01:45.572 --> 00:01:48.968
and the surface, although it's rocky and quite familiar to us

00:01:48.968 --> 00:01:49.669
compared to Earth,

00:01:49.669 --> 00:01:51.044
it's really too hot.

00:01:51.044 --> 00:01:53.840
At the opposite end, if a planet is too far from the star,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:54.903
it is too cold.

00:01:54.903 --> 00:01:56.042
That's the case for Mars.

00:01:56.042 --> 00:01:57.074
So, we need to look for planets

00:01:57.074 --> 00:01:59.247
that are at the right distance from their star

00:01:59.247 --> 00:02:01.482
and also of the right size.

00:02:02.743 --> 00:02:03.821
So, one other thing,

00:02:03.821 --> 00:02:05.889
you know, you might think, "Oh, this is really hard

00:02:05.889 --> 00:02:07.324
because the planet has to be just right.

00:02:07.324 --> 00:02:08.992
It only happened once in our solar system."

00:02:08.992 --> 00:02:10.269
But when you look at the sky at night,

00:02:10.269 --> 00:02:12.563
and here's a video that I took actually from Hawaii,

00:02:12.563 --> 00:02:14.587
a dark place where you can see a lot of stars,

00:02:14.587 --> 00:02:17.231
the first thing you notice is that there are a lot of stars.

00:02:17.231 --> 00:02:18.869
So, the odds are in our favor,

00:02:18.869 --> 00:02:20.710
even if a small fraction of the stars

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:21.939
have habitable planets.

00:02:21.939 --> 00:02:23.079
There are a lot of stars.

00:02:23.079 --> 00:02:24.843
On a moonless night, in a dark site,

00:02:24.843 --> 00:02:26.610
if you count the stars in the sky

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.347
and you count five stars per second,

00:02:28.347 --> 00:02:29.849
it would take you 15 minutes to count

00:02:29.849 --> 00:02:31.388
all of the stars in the sky.

00:02:31.388 --> 00:02:34.112
That is a tiny fraction of the stars in our galaxy.

00:02:34.112 --> 00:02:36.518
If you count all the stars in our galaxy,

00:02:36.518 --> 00:02:39.420
and you also count at five stars per second,

00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.128
it would take you more than 1,000 years

00:02:41.128 --> 00:02:42.990
to count all the stars in our galaxy.

00:02:42.990 --> 00:02:44.325
And then, if you manage

00:02:44.325 --> 00:02:46.488
to count the galaxies in the universe,

00:02:46.488 --> 00:02:48.552
if you count five galaxies per second,

00:02:48.552 --> 00:02:51.060
it would take you also more than 1,000 years

00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:53.404
to count all of the galaxies in the universe.

00:02:53.404 --> 00:02:55.239
So the numbers are just astronomical,

00:02:55.239 --> 00:02:59.176
there's a lot of opportunities for exoplanets.

00:02:59.176 --> 00:03:01.601
There has to be a large number of exoplanets

00:03:01.601 --> 00:03:03.388
along which there are,

00:03:03.388 --> 00:03:05.386
on which there could be life.

00:03:05.386 --> 00:03:07.221
So this is very exciting.

00:03:07.221 --> 00:03:11.964
So let's imagine that maybe only 1 in 100 stars

00:03:11.964 --> 00:03:13.921
has the right kind of planet,

00:03:13.921 --> 00:03:15.647
and I think this is pessimistic.

00:03:15.647 --> 00:03:18.495
If you could visit one of those planets per second,

00:03:18.495 --> 00:03:20.215
it'll take you sixty years

00:03:20.215 --> 00:03:23.117
to actually visit all of them in our galaxy alone.

00:03:23.117 --> 00:03:26.802
That's, I think, one second is not enough to study them.

00:03:26.802 --> 00:03:29.406
So, there's a few hundred of us in this room.

00:03:29.406 --> 00:03:32.674
If we divided the task and each of us basically took

00:03:32.674 --> 00:03:35.251
a couple of minutes to study each planet,

00:03:35.251 --> 00:03:37.557
it would take us a life time to do this.

00:03:37.557 --> 00:03:40.381
Meet back again and tell those amazing stories

00:03:40.381 --> 00:03:41.789
of what we would have seen

00:03:41.789 --> 00:03:45.135
in maybe some TED senior event.

00:03:46.889 --> 00:03:47.895
So, why is it hard?

00:03:47.895 --> 00:03:51.646
Why don't we have pictures of exoplanets with aliens on them?

00:03:51.646 --> 00:03:52.962
Well, here's an example.

00:03:52.962 --> 00:03:54.548
This is a picture that was taken

00:03:54.548 --> 00:03:57.567
by the Cassinni spacecraft as it was orbiting Saturn.

00:03:57.567 --> 00:03:59.009
It's actually behind Saturn,

00:03:59.009 --> 00:04:00.721
so what you see is the sun

00:04:00.721 --> 00:04:03.165
that is blocked by Saturn.

00:04:03.165 --> 00:04:06.034
And if you look very, in detail,

00:04:06.034 --> 00:04:07.314
if you have very sharp eyesight,

00:04:07.314 --> 00:04:09.224
you will see all of us.

00:04:09.224 --> 00:04:11.157
We're all on that picture.

00:04:11.157 --> 00:04:13.556
Here is where we are.

00:04:13.556 --> 00:04:16.053
Um, so that's what Earth starts to look like

00:04:16.053 --> 00:04:17.888
when we look at it from far away.

00:04:17.888 --> 00:04:20.560
Now, we have to do the same thing around other stars,

00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:22.863
and the planet is very close to the star.

00:04:22.863 --> 00:04:24.968
So this is zooming in to us.

00:04:24.968 --> 00:04:26.933
All of us are on that little dot

00:04:26.933 --> 00:04:29.592
at the time the picture was taken.

00:04:29.592 --> 00:04:34.007
So, what I work on is inventing optics, tricks to actually do this,

00:04:34.007 --> 00:04:36.731
to take images of planets around those other stars.

00:04:36.731 --> 00:04:38.945
This is my easiest coronagraph.

00:04:38.945 --> 00:04:40.355
We call this optic tricks, "coronagraph".

00:04:40.355 --> 00:04:41.893
This is the easiest one I ever built.

00:04:41.893 --> 00:04:43.984
I just put my thumb in front of the sun

00:04:43.984 --> 00:04:45.590
and then you can see things around it.

00:04:45.590 --> 00:04:46.919
That's what we're trying to do,

00:04:46.919 --> 00:04:48.255
but we need to do it much better

00:04:48.255 --> 00:04:50.186
than what I did in this picture.

00:04:50.186 --> 00:04:51.825
And, there are two things we need to do:

00:04:51.825 --> 00:04:54.090
we need a much better eye,

00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:54.861
call them telescopes,

00:04:54.861 --> 00:04:58.765
and we need more fancy, clever ways to do it

00:04:58.765 --> 00:04:59.902
than putting a thumb.

00:04:59.902 --> 00:05:03.478
So as an example, one of the projects I work on

00:05:03.478 --> 00:05:05.037
is for the Subaru Telescope,

00:05:05.037 --> 00:05:07.440
which you can see here in this picture.

00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:08.208
It's a very large telescope,

00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:10.215
so I replace my eye by a large telescope.

00:05:10.215 --> 00:05:12.243
And, the other thing that we do

00:05:12.243 --> 00:05:15.148
is the coronagraph is not just a stupid thumb,

00:05:15.148 --> 00:05:16.623
it's this very complicated thing

00:05:16.623 --> 00:05:17.751
that's shown in that picture

00:05:17.751 --> 00:05:20.067
that I would love to have time to tell you about.

00:05:20.067 --> 00:05:22.422
Just to give you a sense for size,

00:05:22.422 --> 00:05:25.997
this arrow points to a door on the side of the telescope,

00:05:25.997 --> 00:05:27.260
and if you have very sharp eyes,

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:30.428
you can see that there is a railing going around the telescope,

00:05:30.428 --> 00:05:32.694
so it's a really big eye.

00:05:32.694 --> 00:05:35.626
So, I think the most exciting thing for me

00:05:35.626 --> 00:05:37.070
is actually to look at the night sky,

00:05:37.070 --> 00:05:38.831
to see all these stars and wonder,

00:05:38.831 --> 00:05:42.209
"Well, are there people on planets around those stars?"

00:05:42.209 --> 00:05:44.409
Because there must be amazing things happening

00:05:44.409 --> 00:05:46.379
around those stars that we don't know yet.

00:05:46.379 --> 00:05:48.509
During your life time, we will start

00:05:48.509 --> 00:05:49.983
to actually figure out those things.

00:05:49.983 --> 00:05:51.590
And the most exciting thing for me

00:05:51.590 --> 00:05:54.033
is to think about, maybe,

00:05:54.033 --> 00:05:56.778
beings on those stars looking back at our star

00:05:56.778 --> 00:05:58.930
and wondering the same thing.

00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:01.361
So I think the future will be extremely exciting

00:06:01.361 --> 00:06:03.768
because we are starting to figure out those things

00:06:03.768 --> 00:06:06.399
and amazing range of possibilities

00:06:06.399 --> 00:06:09.476
is, I think, even wider than our imagination.

00:06:09.476 --> 00:06:10.299
Thank you.
