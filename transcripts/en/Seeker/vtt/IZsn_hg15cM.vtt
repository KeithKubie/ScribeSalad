00:00:00.329 --> 00:00:03.999
If you’ve ever had a car break down and
a mechanic tells you that you’ve got a busted

00:00:03.999 --> 00:00:07.430
thingy-ma-bob, you’ll probably pay the man
and get the part?

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:08.540
But what about us?

00:00:08.540 --> 00:00:10.540
What happens if one of our 206 bones break?

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:12.780
Can i get new one?

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:15.769
If you break a bone, you go to the doctor
and you get a cast.

00:00:15.769 --> 00:00:17.180
Then your bone heals itself.

00:00:17.180 --> 00:00:19.980
Which is actually pretty incredible if you
stop and think about it…

00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.300
We tend to think of bones as these rigid support
systems, but they’re actually made of living

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:25.630
tissue!

00:00:25.630 --> 00:00:30.119
Bones are constantly breaking down and remodeling
themselves to adapt to your lifestyle -- if

00:00:30.119 --> 00:00:34.440
you go from playing video games on your couch
to marathon running, your bones are going

00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.580
to change to compensate!

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.650
It’s pretty incredible -- and scientists
call this adapting: Wolff’s law.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:43.790
So, if I just started marathon running and
break a bone I’m not out of luck.

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:49.020
The body knows exactly what to do: it produces
tons of new cells at the site of the break

00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:50.620
to rebuild the bone over time.

00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:55.730
But if you have cancer, a genetic defect,
or if something really bad happens -- like,

00:00:55.730 --> 00:01:00.180
a break is so bad that than the body can’t
heal it on its own… scientists finally have

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.930
a way to repair bones that befall these situations
too…

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:08.650
Biomedical researchers are figuring out how
to grow bones from a patient's own cells!

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:12.690
This may sound straight out of a frankenstein
novel but it’s actually happening!

00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:18.340
First, they take a CT scan of the patient’s
damaged bone and 3D-print a custom scaffold

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:19.940
to fit in the space.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:23.900
Then, they'll take fat tissue from a patient
and extract stem cells from it.

00:01:23.900 --> 00:01:28.610
Stem cells are these fabulous blank slates
that can be programmed to do just about anything,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:30.160
including bone regeneration.

00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:34.909
Next, they take their scaffold and the extracted
stem cells into a bioreactor … which is

00:01:34.909 --> 00:01:39.170
a fancy incubator that feeds nutrients to
the stem cells and mimics the conditions inside

00:01:39.170 --> 00:01:40.170
the body.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.170
And… that’s it.

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:42.870
We’re now growing bones!

00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:46.330
After a few weeks, viola! … a lab grown
human bone!

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.320
But don’t get too excited.

00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.320
So far, biomedical engineers only have a proof
of concept.

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:56.530
They’ve conducted successful trials in pigs
and are preparing for human trials in the

00:01:56.530 --> 00:01:57.530
future.

00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.770
Tissue engineering is a crazy exciting field
when you think of all the possibilities!

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:05.600
In the future, if you need a new organ or
body part, you won’t have to wait in line

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:09.850
for a donor organ that may or may not even
work in your body -- you’ll be able to use

00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:12.520
your own cells to customize new body parts!

00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.530
We could live forever!Though… at the moment
bone fixes are a bit more Medieval.

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:22.650
There are three main ways we fix bones now:
we snag some animal bones, grab them from

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:27.400
dead persons or cadavers, or just use good
old-fashioned metal implants.

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:31.870
These three options are not ideal because
they can cause infections, or could be rejected

00:02:31.870 --> 00:02:32.870
by the body.

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:37.230
They are, however, considered bioinert, meaning
the body accepts the new part but the addition

00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:39.940
doesn’t necessarily support the rest of
your body.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.200
For instance, titanium implants don’t have
bone marrow, so that implant won’t help

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:46.590
you grow new blood or immune cells.

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:51.380
There is actually a fourth option… taking
a piece of bone from your own body!

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.290
But, it’s horrifying.

00:02:53.290 --> 00:02:58.150
It requires invasive surgery, where doctors
make an incision in a part of your hip bone

00:02:58.150 --> 00:03:03.250
called the iliac crest, and they use a mallet
and chisel to harvest a piece of that bone

00:03:03.250 --> 00:03:05.739
which they then can use in reconstructive
surgery.

00:03:05.739 --> 00:03:07.270
Stop it hurts.

00:03:07.270 --> 00:03:10.760
This autologous bone grafting is super painful
and sometimes risky.

00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:14.190
So the promise of lab-grown bones gets around
all these things.

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.590
These lab-grown thingys are just… bones!

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:21.050
They grow marrow, don’t require thieving
bones or parts from you or other organisms,

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:24.780
and because it’s made from the patient’s
own cells, there’s no chance of rejection.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:27.370
It’s fully customizable to what you need!

00:03:27.370 --> 00:03:28.680
Which is pretty awesome.

00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:33.550
A biomedical engineer on the forefront of
this research claims lab grown bones are changing

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:37.900
everything, because the body becomes a [quote]
“vast renewable resource.”

00:03:37.900 --> 00:03:41.910
So, even though they’re not ready now, there
may come a point when we could keep growing

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:44.510
our own parts again and again and again!

00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.910
Like Harry Potter’s Skelegrow!

00:03:45.910 --> 00:03:48.209
Madam Pomfrey would be pleased as punch.

00:04:14.739 --> 00:04:17.159
Did you know bone marrow grows blood?

00:04:17.159 --> 00:04:18.159
Yep.

00:04:18.159 --> 00:04:19.159
It's weird.

00:04:19.159 --> 00:04:20.159
