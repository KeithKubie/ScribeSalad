00:00:05.367 --> 00:00:09.734
Narrator:
A METALWORKER CLAMPS THE DISK
AGAINST A FORM IN A LATHE.

00:00:09.734 --> 00:00:13.133
AS THE LATHE SPINS,
HE PRESSES THE DISK TO THE FORM

00:00:13.133 --> 00:00:14.934
USING A BLUNT TOOL.

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.300
THIS TRANSFORMS THE DISK
INTO A FLARED VESSEL,

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.000
ONE THAT LOOKS LIKE
A FLOWER POT.

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.701
A CUTTER AT THE SIDE
TRIMS THE RIM.

00:00:25.701 --> 00:00:28.567
THEY CALL THIS FLOWER-POT SHAPE
THE DRAFT.

00:00:28.567 --> 00:00:32.434
A WORKER PRESSES THE SPINNING
DRAFT TO ANOTHER FORM.

00:00:32.434 --> 00:00:36.901
THIS STRETCHES THE ALUMINUM
SHAPE LONGER AND NARROWER.

00:00:36.901 --> 00:00:39.133
FINALLY, THEY TAPER THE CYLINDER
AT THE TOP

00:00:39.133 --> 00:00:40.901
TO FORM A SLANTED CHIMNEY

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:43.000
AND SLICE OFF THE BOTTOM.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.133
HE DRILLS A HOLE
IN THE GRADIENT OF THE KETTLE.

00:00:47.133 --> 00:00:52.000
HE INSERTS A SCREW
THAT'S ATTACHED TO A PUNCH.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:53.834
THEN, USING AN ALLEN WRENCH,

00:00:53.834 --> 00:00:55.200
HE TURNS THE SCREW,

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:56.934
FORCING THE PUNCH INTO THE METAL

00:00:56.934 --> 00:00:59.534
TO CUT OUT A HOLE
FOR THE KETTLE SPOUT.

00:01:02.834 --> 00:01:05.667
HE NOW SLIDES THE KETTLE BODY
OVER A POST

00:01:05.667 --> 00:01:09.067
WITH A DIE THAT FITS
INTO THE SPOUT HOLE.

00:01:09.067 --> 00:01:13.667
HE PLACES THE SPOUT OVER THE DIE
AND HAMMERS IT INTO THE HOLE.

00:01:13.667 --> 00:01:17.834
NEXT, THE INNER WALL OF
THE GHILLIE KETTLE TAKES SHAPE.

00:01:17.834 --> 00:01:19.601
WIELDING A TOOL WITH FORCE,

00:01:19.601 --> 00:01:22.534
A WORKER PULLS AND STRETCHES
THE ALUMINUM DISK

00:01:22.534 --> 00:01:24.200
INTO A LONG CONE.

00:01:29.567 --> 00:01:32.534
HE INSERTS THE CONE
IN THE KETTLE BODY.

00:01:32.534 --> 00:01:35.300
A GAP BETWEEN THEM WILL SERVE
AS THE WATER CHAMBER,

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:39.601
AND SMOKE WILL BE
VENTED OUT THE CENTER.

00:01:39.601 --> 00:01:41.234
HE ROLLS
THE UPPER LIP OF THE CONE

00:01:41.234 --> 00:01:43.033
AROUND THE KETTLE'S TOP RIM,

00:01:43.033 --> 00:01:46.601
LOCKING THEM TOGETHER.

00:01:46.601 --> 00:01:49.734
HE ALSO SECURES THEM
AT THE BASE THE SAME WAY.

00:01:53.667 --> 00:01:55.868
HE TRANSFERS THE GHILLIE KETTLE
TO A STAND

00:01:55.868 --> 00:01:59.267
TO KEEP IT UPRIGHT
AS HE RIVETS STEEL EARS TO IT.

00:02:02.601 --> 00:02:04.033
THE EARS ARE FOR ATTACHING

00:02:04.033 --> 00:02:06.501
THE HANDLE AND A CHAIN
FOR THE KETTLE WHISTLE.

00:02:08.501 --> 00:02:11.767
THE BASE OF THE GHILLIE KETTLE
IS THIS FIRE CHAMBER.

00:02:11.767 --> 00:02:13.300
FOR PACKING PURPOSES,

00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:18.501
HE STACKS IT UPSIDE DOWN
AND PLACES THE KETTLE OVER IT.

00:02:18.501 --> 00:02:21.033
HE WRAPS THE ENTIRE KETTLE
IN BRITISH NEWSPRINT

00:02:21.033 --> 00:02:22.968
FOR SHIPPING.

00:02:22.968 --> 00:02:24.200
THIS PROTECTS IT

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.801
AND ALSO GIVES THE PURCHASER
SOMETHING TO BURN

00:02:26.801 --> 00:02:29.467
THE FIRST TIME
HE OR SHE TRIES IT OUT.

00:02:32.467 --> 00:02:34.033
HE CRIMPS THE ENDS
OF THE HANDLE

00:02:34.033 --> 00:02:36.868
TO THE EARS THAT PROTRUDE
THROUGH THE HEADLINES.

00:02:41.434 --> 00:02:44.801
HE PLACES THE WHISTLE
OVER THE WRAPPED SPOUT

00:02:44.801 --> 00:02:47.300
AND THEN TUCKS THE KETTLE
INTO A DRAWSTRING TOTE.
