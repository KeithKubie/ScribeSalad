00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:07.250
These two quadrilaterals, EFGH
and ABCD, these are similar.

00:00:07.250 --> 00:00:09.720
If through some combination
of translations, rotations,

00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:12.080
reflections, and
dilations, I can

00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:14.240
make them sit on
top of each other.

00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:17.160
And similarity allows us to use
dilations, which essentially

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.770
means scale up one of
the figures up or down.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:21.320
If we're talking
about congruence,

00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:23.444
then we wouldn't be scaling
the figures up or down.

00:00:23.444 --> 00:00:25.910
We would only be translating,
rotating, and reflecting.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.160
But let's see if we can do it.

00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:29.410
So let's first translate it.

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:31.340
Let's first translate
this figure.

00:00:31.340 --> 00:00:34.330
So let's make that point
on top of that point.

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:37.300
And now let's rotate it.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:40.800
I'm going to rotate it around
point E right over here.

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.880
So I get right over there.

00:00:42.880 --> 00:00:45.340
So I got two of the sides
to kind of match up.

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.700
But now let me dilate it down.

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:49.180
Let me scale it down.

00:00:49.180 --> 00:00:51.970
And so this is-- let
me put it on what

00:00:51.970 --> 00:00:53.500
I want to not
change-- and then let

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:57.700
me see if I can scale this down.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.200
And I was able to.

00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.555
So through just purely
translations, rotations--

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.930
I didn't even have to use the
reflections-- translations,

00:01:03.930 --> 00:01:06.360
rotations, and dilations,
I was able to make

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:08.360
these sit on top of each other.

00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:12.420
So these two
figures are similar.

00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.500
So yes, the rectangles
are similar.

00:01:14.500 --> 00:01:17.380
Let's do one more of these.

00:01:17.380 --> 00:01:21.570
So these two triangles--
and just eyeballing it,

00:01:21.570 --> 00:01:23.710
this one looks kind of
taller than this one does

00:01:23.710 --> 00:01:24.380
right over here.

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:28.370
So they don't feel similar,
but let me at least try.

00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:33.450
So let me translate, maybe make
this point C might correspond

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:36.360
to point F, although it already
looks pretty clear that it

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:37.040
won't.

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:41.736
But now let me dilate it.

00:01:41.736 --> 00:01:43.425
So I'll keep that
point where it is.

00:01:43.425 --> 00:01:46.550
And let me try to scale this up.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:48.920
And then we see
pretty clearly we

00:01:48.920 --> 00:01:53.710
made segment CB sit on top
of, after scaling it up,

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:55.520
sit on top of segment FE.

00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.050
But then everything
else is not matching up.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:01:59.810
Point D is in a
very different place

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:03.370
than where point A is
once I try to scale things

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.570
up a little bit.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.650
So these two triangles are
clearly, clearly not similar.
