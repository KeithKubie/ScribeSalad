00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400
After traveling to Guam for this series,

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.920
I’ve learned a lot about the 
indigenous Chamorro people who live there.

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.200
But I still have one more question …

00:00:16.820 --> 00:00:17.320
“It’s honor.”

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:18.260
“Respetu.”

00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.600
“Food and family is the #1 priority.”

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.740
“The homeland.”

00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.280
“Honoring my ancestors.”

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:27.040
“Being Chamorro is everything.”

00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.520
"Which is the Chamorro word for dream.”

00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.820
“Every time someone asks me, like, what am I?

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:33.740
I say Chamorro.

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:35.600
I like saying that, because

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:37.300
most of the time they don’t 
even know what Chamorro is.

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.380
And so that’s like a good conversation starter.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:41.460
Like, ‘Hey, I’m from a little island on Guam.’

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:42.480
‘Oh, what’s Guam?’

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.700
‘It’s a United States territory.’”

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:46.800
“Most people in the United States

00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.380
have no idea what Guam is.

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:50.440
You say, ‘I'm from Guam,’ and people say,

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.460
‘Wow, you don't look African,’

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.000
or people say,

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.940
‘Oh, Guam,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.640
that's right next to Honduras,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.460
I went there once on a 
mission trip or something like that.’”

00:01:00.460 --> 00:01:02.720
“Being a territory for people on Guam

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.680
is very complicated,

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:04.700
especially for Chamorros.

00:01:04.700 --> 00:01:06.200
I mean, you know, there’s just kind of a

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.580
love–hate relationship with the U.S. for many of us.”

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:10.400
“I don't identify as American.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:12.800
I wasn’t raised to. My parents

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:15.520
always made it very clear to me

00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:18.460
that this is not America. This is Guam.”

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:21.420
“Although I am a U.S. citizen by birth,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:24.700
I always identify myself first as a Chamorro.

00:01:25.280 --> 00:01:27.680
I’m a born, raised Chamorro.”

00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.360
“For me, you know, Chamorro is what I am.”

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.780
“So basically if you’re from Guam, 
you’re technically Guamanian.

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:36.860
But I know people who say they're born here but they

00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:39.100
don't want to be called 'Guamanian.'

00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:41.600
They want to be American, because that's their culture.”

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:43.740
“Technically I'm living in America,

00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.980
but the world that I grew up in

00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:48.780
is the Chamorro world.”

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.320
“I identify as Chamorro,

00:01:50.920 --> 00:01:54.180
because even though I speak 
English and that is my primary language,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:57.520
I am Chamorro from my blood to my soul.”

00:01:57.520 --> 00:01:59.180
“I think there's a colonized mentality that,

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:01.800
you know, ‘We will die if the U.S. leaves Guam.’

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:03.880
For hundreds of years of constantly being told,

00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.940
like, ‘You cannot take care of yourselves.

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:09.300
You are not smart enough.
You don't have enough resources.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.800
You need us. Without us, you will starve.’”

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:16.280
“The name that Chamorros always used to 
fear when they spoke out is ‘anti-America,’

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.260
because America for so long 
represented these great ideals of

00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:20.680
freedom and democracy.”

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:24.180
“Growing up as a child, learning U.S. 
history and all of this,

00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:25.220
you know, Guam’s not in there,

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.040
you know. We had these little 
puzzles with the maps of the U.S.

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:29.080
and there's no Guam in there.”

00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.380
“Being a Chamorro woman, being a young Chamorro woman,

00:02:32.380 --> 00:02:36.080
we're told all the time that 
you need to be good at school,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:36.580
good at English.

00:02:36.580 --> 00:02:38.600
I even tried to hide an accent when I was younger,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.460
and now I don't have one because 
I went out of my way to not sound ‘chåd,’

00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:44.060
which is like a derogatory term

00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:45.260
for a native Chamorro person.”

00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.320
“I think people on Guam grow up in this kind of –

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.080
these mixed messages.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.260
It can create some identity

00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:52.720
issues for people.”

00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:55.460
“Am I an American or am I Chamorro?”

00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:56.980
“As a U.S. citizen,

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:03.480
I should be able to express my 
liberties and my constitutional rights.”

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:05.520
“My grandfather was born in 1920,

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.080
my grandmother in 1922.

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:10.000
They grew up in a Guam which was segregated,

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.820
where they couldn't go to 
the movie theater on certain days

00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:14.760
because that was when 
whites went to the movie theater.

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:17.100
There was restaurants that only whites could go to.”

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:20.160
“There were also a lot of racist ideas going on.

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:22.140
I mean, the documents just flat-out saying,

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:25.160
‘By speaking English, you will 
learn honesty and morality.’

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.760
You could be punished at 
schools for speaking Chamorro.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:29.300
So schools, hospitals,

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.940
anything run by the government

00:03:30.940 --> 00:03:32.460
were English-only zones.”

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.480
“I remember the first time

00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.220
I saw someone who I knew was not Chamorro laugh,

00:03:37.220 --> 00:03:39.420
and I freaked out because I thought laughing

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.440
was part of our language only,

00:03:43.700 --> 00:03:44.340
you know.

00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:47.760
The first time I ever saw someone else laugh, I was like, ‘Whoa, dude, you speak Chamorro?’

00:03:47.780 --> 00:03:50.310
And my dad was like, ‘No, son, he’s just laughing.

00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.240
Everyone laughs.’”

00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.080
“It's important to me now, because growing up,

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.060
it wasn't important.

00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:56.500
It wasn't important to speak Chamorro,

00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:58.500
even though that was all my grandmother spoke.

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.380
It wasn't important for me to learn

00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:01.700
how to communicate with her,

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.300
and there's a lot of regret that I carry because I

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.040
wasn’t able to communicate with her.”

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:07.020
“I don't know

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.540
what the value is in pledging yourself to your colonizer.

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.040
If everybody here decided to get an American flag

00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.360
tattoo on your a**,

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.240
it wouldn't have an impact 
on if Guam gets more funding.”

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:19.520
“It's our reclaiming of our identity

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:21.220
and our celebration of who we are.”

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:23.980
“How many Chamorros have to die in Iraq, Afghanistan,

00:04:23.980 --> 00:04:25.880
Vietnam and World War II?

00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:28.740
How many American flag stickers 
do you have to put on your cars?

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.700
How many do you have to fly in front of your houses?

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.960
No matter what America promises us,

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:35.040
they're always going to treat us like we're different

00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.360
and we're less than they are.”

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:39.500
“Hey, guys. I’m Marisa, and I animated this series.

00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:43.220
I love being Chamorro, and it’s 
definitely part of my identity that I embrace.

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:46.920
Don’t forget to watch the rest of this series, 
and please share with your friends

00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.960
and don’t forget to subscribe to Untold America.”
