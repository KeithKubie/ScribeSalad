00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:05.420
So, let's revisit what we are shooting for in the structure of an operating

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:11.420
system. We want the operating system strucure to be thin. That is, like a

00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:15.680
microkernel. That is only mechanisms should be

00:00:15.680 --> 00:00:18.250
in the kernel, and no policies should

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:20.910
be ingrained in the kernel itself. The

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:25.620
structure should allow fine-grained access to system

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:31.786
resources without border crossing, as much as possible. That is, it should

00:00:31.786 --> 00:00:37.570
be like the DOS-like structure. That is, it should have a structure similar to

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:44.950
what we saw in DOS. And it should be flexible, meaning resource management

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:47.020
should be easily morphed to suit

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.890
the needs of the application without sacrificing

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:55.130
protection and performance. So, the flexibility part

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:56.950
of it should be similar to what

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:02.590
we can get from microkernel based approach, but at the same time we want the

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.300
protection and the performance we can get

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:08.746
with the monolithic approach. So in other words,

00:01:08.746 --> 00:01:10.609
in a nutshell what we want in

00:01:10.609 --> 00:01:15.890
the operating structure is performance, protection, and flexibility.
