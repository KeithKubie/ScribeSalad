every year and it turns out to be a
 

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:30.710
every year and it turns out to be a
slice of South America so the size of

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:30.720
slice of South America so the size of
 

00:00:30.720 --> 00:00:33.560

much food is consumed by cities let's

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:47.280
much food is consumed by cities let's
 

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.290
much food is consumed by cities let's
say half it takes half of the size of

00:00:51.290 --> 00:00:51.300
say half it takes half of the size of
 

00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:53.029

now if the human population continues to
 

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.209
now if the human population continues to
increase which we expect it will so over

00:00:59.209 --> 00:00:59.219
increase which we expect it will so over
 

00:00:59.219 --> 00:01:00.889

billion more people to feed and you look
 

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.990
billion more people to feed and you look
around for the land where that's going

00:01:05.990 --> 00:01:06.000
around for the land where that's going
 

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.520

there so the biggest problem facing us

00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:13.650
there so the biggest problem facing us
 

00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:16.850

as a global species is where will the

00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:16.860
as a global species is where will the

food for the next 3 billion people come

00:01:18.649 --> 00:01:18.659
food for the next 3 billion people come
 

00:01:18.659 --> 00:01:21.830
food for the next 3 billion people come
from so it could come from some place

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:21.840
from so it could come from some place
 

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.929
from so it could come from some place
other than a traditional farm and and

the question is could vertical farming

00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:26.310
the question is could vertical farming
 

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:28.490
the question is could vertical farming
solve that problem so by vertical

00:01:28.490 --> 00:01:28.500
solve that problem so by vertical
 

00:01:28.500 --> 00:01:32.090
solve that problem so by vertical
farming and a vertical farm I mean any

00:01:32.090 --> 00:01:32.100
farming and a vertical farm I mean any
 

00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:35.539

than a single story so there are many

00:01:40.039 --> 00:01:40.049
than a single story so there are many
 

00:01:40.049 --> 00:01:41.660

yet I think those are going to be
 

00:02:16.819 --> 00:02:18.880
yet I think those are going to be
expensive and they're going to take a

expensive and they're going to take a
 

00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:22.270
