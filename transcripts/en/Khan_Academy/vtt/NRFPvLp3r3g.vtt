00:00:00.560 --> 00:00:05.180
So when we name organic
molecules, the core of what we

00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:09.340
think about is just how many
carbons form the chain or form

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.070
the ring that we're
looking at?

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.630
So let's say I have something
like this.

00:00:13.630 --> 00:00:15.360
And hopefully, you're reasonably
familiar with what

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:15.870
this represents.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.140
And I'll review it
a little bit.

00:00:17.140 --> 00:00:19.310
So let's say I have something
like this.

00:00:19.310 --> 00:00:21.390
Let's say that that
is the molecular

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.660
structure right there.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.620
And so the first question you
should be asking is how many

00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:27.770
carbons are there?

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:29.030
And some of you might
say, wait, how

00:00:29.030 --> 00:00:30.080
is that even a molecule?

00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.590
And just as a review, the
end point of every line

00:00:32.590 --> 00:00:34.120
represents a carbon.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.620
So that's a carbon, that's a
carbon, that's a carbon,

00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:39.860
that's a carbon, that's a
carbon, that's a carbon.

00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:46.950
And we have one, two, three,
four, five, six carbons and we

00:00:46.950 --> 00:00:49.210
have no double bonds.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:51.830
So if you have all of that
information you're ready to

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:53.500
name this molecule.

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.370
And before I actually name it,
let me just kind of give you

00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.290
all of the different prefixes.

00:00:57.290 --> 00:01:03.370
So if you have one carbon,
the prefix is meth-.

00:01:06.610 --> 00:01:10.400
If you have two carbons,
the prefix is eth-.

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.930
And it's good to memorize
at least up to about 10.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.760
And actually it kind of
repeats after that.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:19.760
If you have three carbons,
the prefix is prop-.

00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.390
Prop- like propane, and you've
heard of ethane and methane.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.140
So you'll see all
of that soon.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:27.560
Four, you're talking
about but-.

00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:30.850
Five, and after five it kind
of becomes the traditional

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:33.480
prefixes that we associate with
a lot of these numbers.

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:36.770
So at five, it's pent-,
like pentagon.

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.280
Six, it's hex- like hexagon.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:42.850
Seven is hept-.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:46.410
Eight is oct-, like octagon.

00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:49.000
Nine is non-.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:50.355
Ten is dec-.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.670
And then after that it kind of
starts to have a pattern here,

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.260
and you're not going to really
deal with things much beyond

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:00.620
the teens, but I'll just write
them down here just out of

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:01.460
interest.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.850
Eleven is undec-.

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.840
And for those of you who know
French, I'm not one of them,

00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:12.360
but I know that one in French
is une, or in Spanish, uno.

00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.400
So it's 1 and 10, 11.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.320
Twelve is dodec-.

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.510
Do or dos, if you're speaking
Spanish, for 2.

00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:25.720
Dec for 10, 2 and
10, that's 12.

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.980
Thirteen, you could imagine
what it's going to be.

00:02:27.980 --> 00:02:29.230
It is tridec-.

00:02:32.540 --> 00:02:34.750
Fourteen is tetradec-.

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.330
A tetrapod is something
with four legs.

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:42.520
And after that it, becomes
very systematic.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.560
At fifteen is pentadec-.

00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:50.730
Notice pent-, 5 and 10.

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.870
Sixteen is hexadec-.

00:02:52.870 --> 00:02:54.690
Seventeen is heptadec-.

00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:56.390
So it just goes on
and on and on.

00:02:56.390 --> 00:02:58.220
I don't think I've got to go--
anyway, it's hexadec-,

00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:02.040
heptadec-, octodec- is
eighteen, nineteen is

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:05.710
nonadec-, and then twenty
is actually iso-.

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:07.140
But we won't even
go into that.

00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.570
This'll probably serve
our purposes.

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.920
I mean, I could go up to
sixteen is hexadec-.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:15.690
So this is just how
many carbons are

00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:17.330
in our longest chain.

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.460
What I drew here is
just one chain.

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:21.430
So we could immediately--
let's try to name it.

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:23.310
Well, how many carbons
do we have here?

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:27.110
Well, we have one, two, three,
four, five, six carbons.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:30.260
So we'll be dealing with
hex- as a prefix.

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.760
And then to get, I guess, the
post-fix on this prefix, or

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:35.990
the kind of the root, you look
to see if there are any double

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:36.940
bonds here.

00:03:36.940 --> 00:03:38.420
And there are no double
bonds here.

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:41.470
And if we have no double bonds
in this carbon chain, we're

00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:43.560
dealing with an alkane.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:47.180
This is called an alkane, which
is a general term for

00:03:47.180 --> 00:03:50.805
all of the chains of carbons
that have no double bonds on

00:03:50.805 --> 00:03:53.390
them, or no triple bonds,
all single bonds.

00:03:53.390 --> 00:03:58.660
So in this situation, you take
hex- for six, so this is hex-.

00:03:58.660 --> 00:04:01.710
And then, because it's
an alkane, it gets

00:04:01.710 --> 00:04:03.170
the -ane from alkane.

00:04:03.170 --> 00:04:07.490
So this is hex-,
this is hexane.

00:04:07.490 --> 00:04:09.190
Let's do another one.

00:04:09.190 --> 00:04:12.120
Let's say I have this
thing right here.

00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:14.640
I'll draw-- let's make
it even longer.

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.529
So let's say I have that
thing right there.

00:04:16.529 --> 00:04:18.160
So how many carbons
do we have?

00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:24.660
We have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven carbons.

00:04:24.660 --> 00:04:27.850
They're all single bonds,
so it's an alkane.

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:30.640
So this will be seven carbons.

00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:37.800
It is heptane because we
have all single bonds.

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.900
Now, if things form a chain,
or if things form a ring, I

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:45.850
should say, we put the prefix
cyclo- in front of it.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:48.930
So if I have-- let me show you
what I'm talking about.

00:04:48.930 --> 00:04:53.910
So if I just have five carbons,
one, two, three,

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.480
four, so one, two, three,
four, five.

00:04:56.480 --> 00:04:57.520
OK, so that's five
right there.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:02.570
I have one, two, three, four,
five carbons in a chain.

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.920
If I just have five carbons in
a chain like this, this would

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:06.170
be pentane.

00:05:10.140 --> 00:05:12.260
But if I have five carbons
and they form a ring,

00:05:12.260 --> 00:05:13.090
so let me draw it.

00:05:13.090 --> 00:05:16.680
So it's one, two, three,
four, five carbons

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:19.030
and it forms a ring.

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:22.230
Let me make the drawing
a little bit better.

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:23.890
So it's really, I'm just
drawing a pentagon.

00:05:23.890 --> 00:05:25.980
But notice, this has
five carbons on it.

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:27.910
I can draw the carbons here.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:30.950
Carbon, carbon, carbon,
carbon, carbon.

00:05:30.950 --> 00:05:33.310
And just as a review, what you
don't see is the hydrogens

00:05:33.310 --> 00:05:33.900
they're bonded to.

00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.660
Each of these guys have two
bonds, so they must have two

00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:38.210
bonds with something else and
those are going to be with

00:05:38.210 --> 00:05:38.480
hydrogen,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.360
And I'lll draw it here just as
a bit of a review, but you

00:05:41.360 --> 00:05:45.160
notice very quickly, the drawing
gets extremely messy

00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.790
when you draw the
two hydrogens on

00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:48.100
each of these carbons.

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:50.210
So it's a little bit
over-- maybe I

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:52.260
shouldn't be doing that.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:52.800
But there you go.

00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:54.420
So it becomes very messy when
you draw the hydrogens, so

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.130
it's better to just assume
that they're there.

00:05:56.130 --> 00:05:58.110
If we don't draw all four bonds
of the carbon, the other

00:05:58.110 --> 00:06:00.810
two bonds are going to
be with hydrogen.

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:03.860
So here, you might say, OK, this
is an alkane, because I

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.450
don't have any double
bonds here.

00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:07.380
All of these are single
bonds with the carbon.

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:10.320
I have five carbons, so you
might say this is pentane, but

00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:11.380
you have to think about
one more thing.

00:06:11.380 --> 00:06:14.670
It's in a ring, so we add
the prefix cyclo- to it.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:18.010
So this is, because it's a ring,
we write cyclopentane.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:24.860
So let me just break
that apart.

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.750
This tells us that we're
dealing with a ring.

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:31.580
You see that this is
a ring right there.

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:37.420
This tells us that we're dealing
with five carbons, and

00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:41.090
then this tells us right here,
the -ane part, that tells us

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.880
that they are all
single bonds.

00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.180
All carbon-carbon
single bonds.

00:06:47.180 --> 00:06:48.940
No double or triple bonds.

00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:51.030
All single bonds.

00:06:51.030 --> 00:06:51.940
So let's go the other way.

00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.030
Let's start with the word and
let's see if we can figure out

00:06:56.030 --> 00:06:58.225
what the actual structure
would look like.

00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.810
Let's say I have cyclononane.

00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.040
So what is this telling me?

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.120
This tells me I'm dealing
with a ring.

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.570
That is a ring.

00:07:16.570 --> 00:07:18.170
It's going to have
a ring structure.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:22.520
It's going to have nine carbons,
nine C's, and then

00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:25.395
it's an alkane, so they're all
going to be single bonds.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:36.850
So if I want to draw it, I want
to draw nine carbons in a

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:38.465
ring, it's not a trivial
thing to draw.

00:07:38.465 --> 00:07:46.190
I'll try my best, so let's see,
that's one, two, three,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:51.690
four, five, six, seven, eight.

00:07:54.620 --> 00:07:55.760
Let's see, let me draw it.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.470
I'll try a little a
better shot at it.

00:07:58.470 --> 00:08:06.900
So, let's see, you have one,
two, three, four, five, six,

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:11.390
seven, eight, and then nine.

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:13.910
And then you can connect the
last. So let me make sure that

00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.870
this is-- and obviously, I could
have drawn it better

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:17.950
than that, but hopefully, you
can see all of the edges here.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:24.660
So I have one, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight,

00:08:24.660 --> 00:08:27.650
nine carbons.

00:08:27.650 --> 00:08:28.600
It's in a cycle.

00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.210
It's in a ring.

00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:30.460
I have nine carbons.

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:34.919
They're all single bonded, so
this is cyclononane, although

00:08:34.919 --> 00:08:38.240
there's probably better ways to
draw that ring right there.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:47.050
So if someone were to tell you,
octane, and that word

00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:49.860
might feel familiar to you
from the gas station.

00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:53.310
They are literally talking about
the molecule octane.

00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:55.060
And now you know, or at least
you have a sense of what

00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:55.720
they're talking about.

00:08:55.720 --> 00:09:01.000
The oct- tells you that you
have eight carbons.

00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.680
There's no cyclo- in front of
it, so it's not a cyclo.

00:09:03.680 --> 00:09:05.180
It's just going to be a chain.

00:09:05.180 --> 00:09:08.680
And then the -ane part tells
you that they're all single

00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.580
bonds, so it's just going to be
eight carbons in a chain.

00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:16.580
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:17.600
It's just going to
look like that.

00:09:17.600 --> 00:09:21.980
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight.

00:09:21.980 --> 00:09:24.290
