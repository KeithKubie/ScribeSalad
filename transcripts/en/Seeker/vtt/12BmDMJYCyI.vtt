00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.040
We had been looking at the bottoms of trees,
as foresters, for over a century,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.140
and nobody ever knew 
the top was so different from the bottom.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:17.600
Located hundreds of feet above the ground
in the canopies of forests is a unique ecosystem

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:21.640
that is home to a potential cure for some
of the world’s deadliest diseases,

00:00:21.640 --> 00:00:28.020
microscopic tardigrades, and temporarily, this group of
daredevil researchers.

00:00:29.620 --> 00:00:34.960
With the advent of ropes and a few slingshots
that I invented along the way, we went to

00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.510
the mid-canopy and we went to the upper canopy,
which were really new exploration opportunities.

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:46.000
Dr. Meg Lowman pioneered forest exploration
when all there was to use

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:48.660
were cranes, hot air balloons, and walkways.

00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:53.040
Now, that toolkit is expanding, which is essential
to help combat threats

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:56.160
such as deforestation and drought.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:03.540
Suddenly we have drones, and we also have
LiDAR, and some of the other aerial technologies

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:09.640
that are giving us incredible, broad brush
strokes of things like canopy drought, distribution

00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.740
of canopy vines, or certain species of trees
that we're trying to track

00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:17.660
that make it really tough to do, tree after tree, 
from the ground.

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.380
One of the areas of Meg’s expertise involves
the close relationship

00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:26.079
between insects and plants in the rainforest.

00:01:26.940 --> 00:01:32.760
I have to learn a lot about both. I do focus on 
the tree as a system,

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:37.960
and the tree as a support for so many other types 
of life in the rainforest.

00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:43.020
But I do focus a lot on insects, because they
tend to be the dominant herbivore,

00:01:43.020 --> 00:01:47.980
and there are millions of insects up there, 
and they are beautiful and gorgeous.

00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:54.420
The levels of light and rain hitting the top
of these forests cause canopies to be hotspots

00:01:54.420 --> 00:02:00.000
for biodiversity, accounting for likely fifty percent
of all land-based life on Earth.

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:07.880
- Of that fifty percent life on Earth, probably
only ten percent has been seen or discovered

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:11.720
by that handful of us that explore the canopy.

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.100
How many species are in the rainforest?

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:16.600
Maybe there are 5 million.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:20.440
But it truly is a guessing game, because maybe
we've missed a whole group.

00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.760
And I think water bears is a good example.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:27.940
That's a whole phylum that nobody really explored
until about the last three or four years

00:02:27.940 --> 00:02:31.980
when I partnered with a water bear taxonomist.

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:36.560
We can't even count those creatures when we're
up there, because we can't see them

00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.380
with our naked eye.

00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:44.340
These water bears, or tardigrades, are tiny: 
roughly half a millimeter.

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:48.790
These creatures are most likely carried to
these towering trees by wind.

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:53.620
If these extremophiles do not find their environment
to be satisfactory, they can enter a stage

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:58.700
known as cryptobiosis, curling up into a ball
to survive extreme conditions for extended

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:05.120
periods of time without food or water, and
coming back to life when conditions have improved.

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:11.260
New species of tardigrades continue to be
discovered and analyzed,

00:03:11.260 --> 00:03:15.660
given that their cellular construction
could reveal clues to radiation protection,

00:03:15.660 --> 00:03:19.540
and their genetics could
lead to answers surrounding resiliency.

00:03:19.540 --> 00:03:24.060
This is just one of the areas that Meg comes
across in her work with trees and insects

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:28.940
that underscores how important this resource
can be for humans.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:35.520
In a few cases, pharmaceutical companies have
made that magical link

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.660
between plants and medicines.

00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:44.240
And so it's given me a really wonderful ability
to work with the local shaman and the villagers

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:49.489
in a lot of countries where the medicinal
value of the trees is so important.

00:03:49.489 --> 00:03:53.980
The leaves that aren't eaten by insects tend
to be the ones that have sequestered

00:03:53.980 --> 00:03:58.260
chemical compounds that can in turn be turned into
medicines.

00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:02.240
We now realize we can use the insect damage
to figure out which trees

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:05.019
might have more medicinal values.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:10.600
Meg’s research has even more
urgency, especially if the rate of deforestation

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:12.829
continues at the current pace.

00:04:12.829 --> 00:04:18.220
Using satellite analysis, NASA predicts that
in just 40 years, about a billion hectares

00:04:18.220 --> 00:04:22.780
of rainforest land, about the size of Europe,
will have disappeared.

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:28.120
In 100 years, rainforests will be gone altogether.

00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:32.820
Forests are essential to our life.

00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.180
We have so many easy ways of connecting ourselves
to trees.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:40.830
I mentioned medicines, fruits, home to biodiversity.

00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:42.620
Soil conservation.

00:04:42.620 --> 00:04:45.560
Carbon storage is a huge one.

00:04:46.220 --> 00:04:51.360
It's hard to sell people on the fact that
they should keep millions of creatures alive

00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:54.960
when they probably can't understand their
importance value.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:05:02.540
I think a good analogy is that in an airplane
there are a lot of redundant screws,

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:06.280
and maybe you don't need every single one to fly the
plane, but at some point,

00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:11.260
if they keep dropping off of the machine, 
it's not going to work anymore.

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:18.660
We know that each species has a role in this
ecosystem, and we need to keep that system healthy.

00:05:19.580 --> 00:05:21.120
How many can we lose?

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:24.460
Probably some, but not all.

00:05:24.460 --> 00:05:26.620
And where is that tipping point?

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:27.910
We're not really sure.

00:05:27.910 --> 00:05:33.980
So the more that we can protect those species,
the better off we are.
