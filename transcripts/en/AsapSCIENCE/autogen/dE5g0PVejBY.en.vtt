00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:05.150
 Polls show that most people want to die "quickly, while they sleep, without suffering" 

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:10.679
 But the chances of this happening to you are very low. So, when the time comes for it 

00:00:10.679 --> 00:00:12.170
 What is the state of death that will be most vulnerable to it? 

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:18.770
 In 1901 the average life expectancy of people was 31 years, and in nearly 100 years 

00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:24.020
 The rate rose to 71 years. If you live in an advanced country like France or Canada, 

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:28.720
 They may live up to 82 years, while in developing or minority countries such as 

00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:31.580
 Rwanda has an average age of 64 years. 

00:00:31.580 --> 00:00:37.510
 Many of these people die in strange ways, including the deaths of 27 people in 2015 while taking personal photos (selves). 

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:43.550
 A man died of heart failure and exhaustion after playing Starcraft for 50 hours, 

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:48.879
 About 100 people a year die in Russia from the fall of snow-capped blocks. Not to mention death 

00:00:48.879 --> 00:00:52.629
 70 children suffocating by cutting sausages every year. 

00:00:52.629 --> 00:00:58.300
 But if we take the United States as an example of Western countries, we have more than 318 million 

00:00:58.300 --> 00:01:04.890
 Person in 2014, which means the death of more than 2.6 million people. Half of these people often died 

00:01:04.890 --> 00:01:09.350
 Of heart disease and cancer, which is different from the last hundred years, when most people 

00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.500
 They die from TB and flu. 

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:17.000
 The scientific progress of drugs and drugs such as antibiotics and vaccines has reduced the number of deaths 

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:23.030
 Influenza and tuberculosis, and even reduced rates of cancer death. In 1970, the rate of survival was high 

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.360
 Of the cancer is only 50% - today it has risen to 68% with 15.5 million survivors of cancer 

00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:33.590
 Alive in the United States. Thanks Flag! 

00:01:33.590 --> 00:01:37.539
 Unfortunately, heart disease and cancer are not the causes of sudden death, and are often caused 

00:01:37.539 --> 00:01:42.869
 Death is slow and painful. In fact, 60% of hospital deaths are attributed to one of these cases. 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:47.611
 At a rate of 1 per 10 individuals after staying in hospital for a month or more. 

00:01:47.611 --> 00:01:53.579
 Of course, sudden death occurs, with some 13,605 people dying from accidental accidents and injuries 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:56.440
 In 2014, in the United States. 

00:01:56.440 --> 00:02:01.571
 Media can influence our fears and worries about dying in strange ways. In the end, 

00:02:01.571 --> 00:02:07.469
 Not one person died of shark attacks in the United States during 2014, but dogs killed 38 people that year. 

00:02:07.469 --> 00:02:12.290
 Many people fear cycling in the city, but you are more likely to die as you walk, 

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:18.570
 Where about 6,200 pedestrians were killed, while 900 people died while driving the bike. 

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.550
 One person died from a terrorist attack, and 80 died of alcohol abuse 

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:28.209
 In fact, most terrorist activities in the West are the result of individual attackers 

00:02:28.209 --> 00:02:33.849
 Which does not follow 80% of the Islamic organizations, but either be political extremists, 

00:02:33.849 --> 00:02:40.959
 Or have ethnic or national racial racism, on the world scale in 2015, 78% of deaths from terrorism occur 

00:02:40.959 --> 00:02:46.459
 Only in five countries: Afghanistan, Iraq, Nigeria, Pakistan and Syria. 

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:51.190
 Your place of living greatly affects the way you will die; in the 34 poorest countries 

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:55.910
 You are more likely to die because of respiratory problems - not because of smoking, but because of swallowing 

00:02:55.910 --> 00:03:00.550
 Vapors during cooking. Women in Japan are less likely to die from heart disease, 

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:05.630
 And live to an average age of 87 years, compared to 80 years for American women. 

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.360
 This is often attributed to the Japanese diet. 

00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.120
 In the future, is not expected to live for longer ages only, but we may be able to determine the way 

00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:16.370
 And the time of our death. In fact, the latest computer systems have been developed 

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:22.519
 To estimate the time and the way we might die by 90%, based on medical history, 

00:03:22.519 --> 00:03:27.570
 Lifestyle and other factors. The question is - do you want to know how and when you will die? 

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:29.659
