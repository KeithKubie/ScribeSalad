1
00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.460
Not to this part of it, but to that, yeah,

2
00:00:02.890 --> 00:00:06.410
I'm rubber Coolidge and I'm Latif Nasser. Thank you. And, uh,

3
00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:09.120
today on radio lab, I, Robert,

4
00:00:09.121 --> 00:00:14.121
I am going to make you wrestle with your most cherished ideal American

5
00:00:14.971 --> 00:00:18.120
democracy. Oh, I see. Okay, great. Uh, wait, hang on a second.

6
00:00:18.121 --> 00:00:22.220
I'm just struggling of the offense now. I have one. Okay. Okay, great. And,

7
00:00:22.300 --> 00:00:26.680
and I'm going to start things off by introducing you to Yasha.

8
00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:31.500
Yasha Munk. I'm a lecturer on government at Harvard. He studies politics, uh,

9
00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.740
Duh, Duh, Duh, Duh Duh, Duh. What I suppose I was going to say, uh,

10
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.180
maybe we could just start with where you grew up. Yeah, so I was, um, so I,

11
00:00:39.181 --> 00:00:42.540
I was born 1982. I uh, grew up in Germany, moved,

12
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:46.110
moved around a bunch of different places for Germany as a kid and then went to

13
00:00:46.111 --> 00:00:48.780
college in England, Cambridge in 2000.

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:53.700
And I was kind of studying politics. I was a history major.

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:57.150
So Yasha was studying politics, but he was studying it in the past.

16
00:00:57.151 --> 00:00:58.590
So he was looking at, you know,

17
00:00:58.591 --> 00:01:02.880
going all the way back to the cradle of democracy in ancient Greece and then how

18
00:01:02.910 --> 00:01:07.440
democracy came to thrive around the world. But as he was studying that,

19
00:01:07.590 --> 00:01:09.390
he was noticing, you know, in the news,

20
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.780
he would see in certain countries like France or Austria, you know,

21
00:01:12.781 --> 00:01:14.070
there would be these parties,

22
00:01:14.071 --> 00:01:19.071
these far right ultra nationalist anti-immigrant parties that were starting to

23
00:01:20.071 --> 00:01:24.060
gain some traction. And for Yasha, I saw some of this,

24
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:27.570
this was a little bit scary because my family's been in the wrong place at the

25
00:01:27.571 --> 00:01:29.490
wrong time for about four generations.

26
00:01:29.730 --> 00:01:32.130
His great grandparents perished during the Holocaust.

27
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:34.020
My grandparents sort of barely survived.

28
00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:38.460
Ms. Howard Jr and my hands grew up in Poland and were thrown out of the country

29
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.440
and a huge sort of antisemitic wave in 1968. And so the idea that, you know,

30
00:01:43.441 --> 00:01:46.080
political system that seemed relatively stable, it's emergency, peaceful,

31
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:50.130
might sudden uterine fractures and, and even violent. Um,

32
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.480
something that I suppose I,

33
00:01:51.481 --> 00:01:53.700
I always had to sort of dim awareness of even as a kid.

34
00:01:54.270 --> 00:01:58.350
So I remember being quite worried by this and having friends who were quite

35
00:01:58.351 --> 00:01:59.184
worried about it,

36
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:03.210
but we were worried about it as sort of this weird bad thing that's going on.

37
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.720
I didn't think we actually fought that these people might win jump to early 2010

38
00:02:10.940 --> 00:02:14.590
<v 1>did he start winning for the first time?</v>

39
00:02:15.220 --> 00:02:18.340
Molly Napan will have a seat in parliament along the seven others from her far

40
00:02:18.341 --> 00:02:19.174
right party

41
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.000
<v 0>these far right parties in Austria and France.</v>

42
00:02:21.001 --> 00:02:25.290
They start to gain power and it's not just there that huge swaths of Europe.

43
00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.680
What?

44
00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.100
What's what's happening in the Israeli is also happening elsewhere in Europe.

45
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:33.360
Similar rate when Cardi start rising up and it'll leave Greece, the Netherlands,

46
00:02:33.390 --> 00:02:34.800
Poland, Hungary,

47
00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.900
an identity crisis for the entire European continent and it's not just Europe.

48
00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:42.430
You have India, Turkey and

49
00:02:42.490 --> 00:02:46.120
<v 1>what started off as of course United States. Unlikely.</v>

50
00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:49.730
Impossible is now reality. Basically

51
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.270
<v 0>there's this wave of politicians whose message was people aren't really</v>

52
00:02:53.271 --> 00:02:56.360
listening to you. Your government has failed you. Trust me,

53
00:02:56.540 --> 00:02:58.880
I would speak for the people I'm going to fix.

54
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.270
<v 3>And to Yasha this was, you know,</v>

55
00:03:04.271 --> 00:03:09.271
this was like a wake up call and not just because of immigration policy or right

56
00:03:09.701 --> 00:03:13.920
and left leanings of certain politicians, but even more deeply than that.

57
00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:17.870
<v 0>I was quite worried about the way in which these political movements perhaps</v>

58
00:03:17.871 --> 00:03:22.040
pretended to have some allegiance to democratic mechanisms.

59
00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:24.050
But actually when you were enemies of it,

60
00:03:24.380 --> 00:03:27.580
<v 3>like there was this one guy, the leader of the Austrian Freedom Party</v>

61
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:29.370
<v 0>glorified the third,</v>

62
00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:33.300
right in various ways and really harking back to the country's fascist past in a

63
00:03:33.301 --> 00:03:38.160
positive way. Uh, that wasn't a farfetched fear, I don't think.

64
00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:39.053
I mean,

65
00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:43.170
a huge number of the world's dictators have been elected democratically at some

66
00:03:43.171 --> 00:03:43.980
point,

67
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:47.910
and then they move against democratic institutions in such a way that you con

68
00:03:47.911 --> 00:03:49.620
displays from democratically anymore.

69
00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:53.770
<v 3>So for Yasha, who by this point was a lecturer at Harvard, he, you know,</v>

70
00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:56.500
kept seeing this in country after country after country.

71
00:03:56.501 --> 00:04:01.501
He saw these citizens willingly elect these wannabe dictators into power.

72
00:04:02.620 --> 00:04:07.620
And so he started wondering what is making the citizens do this?

73
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:13.150
Do they, do they feel like their current leaders don't get them? Do they,

74
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:16.570
are they, are they riled up about, you know, some issue of the day, like,

75
00:04:16.571 --> 00:04:21.200
like refugees or income inequality? Or is this

76
00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.570
<v 4>sign that they're upset about something even more foundational?</v>

77
00:04:25.900 --> 00:04:27.940
The political system itself,

78
00:04:28.210 --> 00:04:31.630
like are they actually angry with democracy itself?

79
00:04:31.930 --> 00:04:35.980
And so I sat down with a friend and colleague, um, to figure it out.

80
00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.480
And his friend, it turns out,

81
00:04:37.481 --> 00:04:40.450
worked on something called the world values survey,

82
00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:43.960
which is a video ambitious attempt to try and get a public opinion around the

83
00:04:43.961 --> 00:04:44.660
world.

84
00:04:44.660 --> 00:04:48.550
It's basically just a bunch of social scientists who ask a whole bunch of very

85
00:04:48.551 --> 00:04:52.300
standard questions to a whole bunch of people all over the world.

86
00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.080
And they're like, okay, well let's, let's actually like scrutinize what,

87
00:04:56.530 --> 00:04:58.300
what's being said in here about democracy.

88
00:04:58.670 --> 00:05:00.830
<v 0>And when we actually looked at the numbers</v>

89
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.230
<v 4>this [inaudible],</v>

90
00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:05.360
<v 0>uh, we would, you know, honestly flabbergasted by what we saw. Oh,</v>

91
00:05:06.620 --> 00:05:06.921
<v 3>okay.</v>

92
00:05:06.921 --> 00:05:11.921
So there's actually three questions in particular that he got interested in.

93
00:05:13.340 --> 00:05:16.130
Okay. Here. So let's start with, uh, this one.

94
00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:20.390
How do you feel about a strong ruler who doesn't have to bother with parliament

95
00:05:20.391 --> 00:05:24.590
or elections who doesn't have to bother with parliaments or elections? Correct.

96
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:25.800
Yeah. Okay.

97
00:05:25.800 --> 00:05:28.550
And they also ask this of Americans just instead of doesn't have to bother with

98
00:05:28.551 --> 00:05:31.160
parliament. It was, doesn't have to bother with Congress anyway.

99
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:36.700
So in 1995 24% of all Americans endorsed that kind of strong man leader.

100
00:05:39.650 --> 00:05:43.460
24 so you know, one out of every four. Yeah.

101
00:05:43.461 --> 00:05:44.720
But in the last several years,

102
00:05:44.721 --> 00:05:49.721
that number has jumped from 24 to 32% so now it's a third almost.

103
00:05:50.450 --> 00:05:51.340
That's a, yeah.

104
00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:56.630
Say a strong leader who doesn't have to deal with Congress or elections is

105
00:05:56.750 --> 00:05:58.280
either very good or fairly

106
00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.060
<v 0>good thing. Wow. Wow. That surprises me. It's kind of,</v>

107
00:06:01.070 --> 00:06:04.970
it's kind of even more striking in Europe. So in, in Germany,

108
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.940
one in six people used to life but idea,

109
00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:13.150
but now to one in three in Germany where they should know better.

110
00:06:14.290 --> 00:06:16.040
Yeah. In France and United Kingdom,

111
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:21.230
it was one in four 20 years ago and now it's one in two half, half. Yeah.

112
00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:24.110
So every second rit and Frenchman says, yeah,

113
00:06:24.390 --> 00:06:27.140
the idea of a strong ruler who doesn't have to bubble of parliament

114
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:31.010
introductions, that's pretty appealing to me. It's not appealing to me.

115
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.330
That is not appealing to me.

116
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:36.830
Who would say that they like to not be involved in a democracy,

117
00:06:37.010 --> 00:06:40.310
which is about being involved. Ah, okay. Well if you think that's crazy.

118
00:06:40.311 --> 00:06:43.460
Here comes question number two, uh, flat out simple, straight forward.

119
00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:46.550
How important is it to, to live in a democracy on a scale of one to 10.

120
00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:50.780
And when you look at Americans born of the 1930s and 1940s,

121
00:06:51.230 --> 00:06:55.280
two thirds of them give the highest importance to living in a democracy.

122
00:06:55.370 --> 00:07:00.360
I say that's really essential. Well, two third seems a little soft to me. Sure.

123
00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.420
But among Americans points since 1980, it's less than one third,

124
00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.040
less than one third. Consider it essential to live in a democracy.

125
00:07:11.270 --> 00:07:15.480
What? Less than a third? Yeah.

126
00:07:15.650 --> 00:07:20.300
So over a hundred people, a hundred young people, 30 to 30, 30,

127
00:07:20.301 --> 00:07:23.510
25 would say, I love democracy. That's very important than the rest.

128
00:07:23.870 --> 00:07:28.490
What would the rest say? It's not, it's not the most important thing for them.

129
00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:33.050
Deciding where to live. Okay. When, if, if you are, if this is good,

130
00:07:33.051 --> 00:07:35.630
where would you like to, like what would you prefer?

131
00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.740
Would you like to be living? That's a good segue to the next question.

132
00:07:40.250 --> 00:07:43.520
A final question, which was about army rule.

133
00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.060
So do you think for the army rule is a good system of government army rule?

134
00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.410
So we're not, this is no civilians anymore.

135
00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:53.990
Soldiers running the government soldiers following orders,

136
00:07:53.991 --> 00:07:58.430
soldiers giving orders. So 20 years ago, um,

137
00:07:58.610 --> 00:08:02.810
about one in 16 Americans fought that was a good system of government.

138
00:08:04.190 --> 00:08:06.470
Uh, and the most recent poll a couple of years ago,

139
00:08:06.530 --> 00:08:11.530
it was one and six and among young and affluent Americans,

140
00:08:12.260 --> 00:08:16.430
it's actually gone up from 6% to 35%.

141
00:08:16.430 --> 00:08:19.130
So it's a six fold increase in America.

142
00:08:19.340 --> 00:08:22.850
You have one in three young affluent Americans.

143
00:08:22.851 --> 00:08:27.140
I am military rose a wonderful thing. That's what you're saying. Yeah, exactly.

144
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:32.480
Yeah. That's misguided or tragic.

145
00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:36.440
I don't know which. So Yasha said something, he was like, look like,

146
00:08:36.441 --> 00:08:39.530
I don't think of a colonel's took over tomorrow. Uh,

147
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:42.340
one third of Americans would say, this is wonderful. I,

148
00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:43.550
I don't think that's actually true,

149
00:08:43.551 --> 00:08:48.200
but it does show a deep lack of attachment to the current political system and

150
00:08:48.201 --> 00:08:52.160
this sort of sense of, you know what I mean? Let's try something new.

151
00:08:52.340 --> 00:08:56.010
How bad could things get? I didn't think it could be much worse than what

152
00:08:56.010 --> 00:08:59.640
<v 5>we have today. Here's, here's the thing that gets to be,</v>

153
00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:05.200
let's imagine a well intentioned but totally authoritarian dictator who takes

154
00:09:05.941 --> 00:09:07.530
over, gets used to power,

155
00:09:07.531 --> 00:09:12.330
and then as dictators do chooses to remain in place forever.

156
00:09:12.780 --> 00:09:17.780
The adventure of democracy is that it admits that nothing is ever right.

157
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:22.260
We always have to fix it and the system has built in it.

158
00:09:23.050 --> 00:09:28.050
Even permanents every six years you elect a senator over again every two years

159
00:09:28.681 --> 00:09:30.240
you elect the congressman over again.

160
00:09:30.241 --> 00:09:33.510
Every four years you can have the option to switch presidents.

161
00:09:33.511 --> 00:09:36.900
Presidents can't serve beyond a particular point. There will be checks,

162
00:09:36.901 --> 00:09:38.640
there will be balances, they will be protection.

163
00:09:38.641 --> 00:09:43.641
But the whole thing admits that there's always change and always the ability to

164
00:09:44.641 --> 00:09:47.700
change. And this trip that you just read me, he says, Nah,

165
00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:51.870
we don't believe in it anymore. Well that's dangerous to me. Scary to me.

166
00:09:51.871 --> 00:09:56.280
I think my response is if that's the case and I don't argue that people have

167
00:09:56.281 --> 00:10:00.720
these opinions, if that's the case, then let's fix it. Let's not throw it out.

168
00:10:00.900 --> 00:10:02.880
Let's repair it in some way.

169
00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.330
That's w that's what it seems like a moment like this calls for.

170
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:11.640
That's the speech basically.

171
00:10:11.641 --> 00:10:14.190
You're saying let's fix it. Yeah.

172
00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.750
<v 3>Yeah. Well, um, I mean, and there's,</v>

173
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:23.080
there's a lot to fix, right? Obviously there's,

174
00:10:23.081 --> 00:10:25.360
there's corporate money and special interests,

175
00:10:25.361 --> 00:10:29.050
lobbyists and gerrymandering and minority groups who don't get a voice and

176
00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:31.420
active voter suppression in a lot of places.

177
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.140
The weirdness of the electoral college to two party system in general where it

178
00:10:35.141 --> 00:10:38.530
seems like they have nothing to do except for hate on each other. Um,

179
00:10:38.710 --> 00:10:43.630
but the thing is so, so just focusing like take this very specific week,

180
00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:47.140
this week that we are talking about this, there is a midterm election coming up.

181
00:10:47.770 --> 00:10:52.450
And so I figured, let's like, let's just focus on one thing, voting.

182
00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:53.410
Like,

183
00:10:53.410 --> 00:10:58.300
is there a way to just tweak this fundamental part of democracy?

184
00:10:58.301 --> 00:11:03.301
Like can we change the way we vote so that people don't feel as many people now

185
00:11:03.791 --> 00:11:07.330
do that they're throwing their vote away, that their vote doesn't count,

186
00:11:07.331 --> 00:11:09.580
that their vote, uh, um,

187
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.140
<v 5>it's a wasted. Okay.</v>

188
00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:18.050
So what would you suggest?

189
00:11:18.360 --> 00:11:23.220
<v 0>So what I got is a kind of an alternate universe. It's, it's,</v>

190
00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.400
it's a different way of doing elections that could have a profound effect on the

191
00:11:29.461 --> 00:11:33.870
way our democracy works. Ab, can you hear me? Yes, there we are. Oh good.

192
00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:38.220
Okay, cool. And we're going to start off with producer Simon Adler. Yeah.

193
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:40.290
So in search of democratic inspiration,

194
00:11:40.560 --> 00:11:43.890
I called across the ocean to the Emerald Aisle to talk to this guy.

195
00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:45.420
So my name is Ab Philbin Bowman.

196
00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:49.690
I currently work for Archie Radio One on the drivetime program abs,

197
00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:54.110
a radio producer reporter for Ireland's equivalent to the known as art

198
00:11:54.110 --> 00:11:57.250
<v 6>t e and he's a self-described election nerd. Okay.</v>

199
00:11:57.251 --> 00:11:59.260
So just sort of start from the start please.

200
00:11:59.261 --> 00:12:03.460
The way I would look at this as American democracy is one of the oldest

201
00:12:03.461 --> 00:12:04.360
democracies in the world.

202
00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:09.420
It's kind of like a laptop from 1985 and at the time everybody was like,

203
00:12:09.670 --> 00:12:12.790
oh my God, this is incredible. It's so fast. It's so responsive.

204
00:12:12.910 --> 00:12:16.090
You're going to get so much stuff done with this, and to be fair, you did,

205
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:18.760
but you've got to keep updating your operating system.

206
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.690
Otherwise pretty soon your democracy is struggling to deal with things like

207
00:12:22.840 --> 00:12:26.200
Facebook news feeds and Twitter and leave yourself open to being hacked by

208
00:12:26.201 --> 00:12:29.800
Russia. Now in Ireland, we got our democracy a little bit later,

209
00:12:30.100 --> 00:12:31.380
the 1920s okay.

210
00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:36.690
And at that point democracy had moved on from the 1770 1780s when you guys sort

211
00:12:37.931 --> 00:12:42.520
of brought in your democracy and we adopted this, what was then quite modern,

212
00:12:42.980 --> 00:12:44.730
uh, voting system, Cooke PR.

213
00:12:48.190 --> 00:12:50.800
S. T. V. R. S. T. V. Exactly. It sounds a bit like an STD.

214
00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:54.860
It does sound quite like a sexually transmitted infection. It does, yes. Oh,

215
00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:56.860
this seems like dead in the water from hello.

216
00:12:57.040 --> 00:13:00.550
The extended version is multi-season PRS TV. That's really sounds like an STI.

217
00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.140
It's not one more time. Say it again. Multiset p.

218
00:13:05.141 --> 00:13:06.640
R. S. T, V,

219
00:13:06.670 --> 00:13:11.470
which stands for multi-season proportional representation by single transferable

220
00:13:11.471 --> 00:13:15.460
vote. I have no idea what that means. Well,

221
00:13:16.790 --> 00:13:20.690
weird as it might sound. This is a system of voting that unlike ours,

222
00:13:20.850 --> 00:13:24.010
I can make every voter feel hurt. Oh,

223
00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:28.000
gets you candidates who best reflect the collective interest of the people and

224
00:13:28.050 --> 00:13:31.940
and make sure no one ever feels like they're throwing their vote away.

225
00:13:33.620 --> 00:13:35.160
I don't believe you. You don't have,

226
00:13:35.230 --> 00:13:37.970
you don't have to believe all I'm following. Tell us,

227
00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.300
tell us how this impossible feat w how does this even work?

228
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.560
I'm walking through the lower part of Dublin central. Well,

229
00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.530
let's just put this in concrete terms. Great. Okay,

230
00:13:49.590 --> 00:13:54.590
so 2016 there's an election for the national parliament in the Dublin central

231
00:13:55.021 --> 00:13:55.854
district.

232
00:13:56.070 --> 00:14:01.070
It's blocks of brick rowhouses punctuated by these brightly colored pink or

233
00:14:02.791 --> 00:14:04.350
purple or yellow doors.

234
00:14:04.351 --> 00:14:07.050
You can think of it like an election district in Ireland.

235
00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:11.550
It's what's known as a constituency, couple adult stores, low rise,

236
00:14:11.570 --> 00:14:13.950
white public housing units.

237
00:14:14.210 --> 00:14:18.960
It's predominantly working class constituency with lots of difficulties.

238
00:14:18.961 --> 00:14:20.580
This is Moreno Sullivan,

239
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:24.180
a longtime resident of the constituency with the shock of white hair.

240
00:14:24.510 --> 00:14:26.870
And I've always been involved with youth clubs, et Cetera,

241
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:31.350
doing volunteer work and then teaching in communities in the area.

242
00:14:31.560 --> 00:14:35.280
And so back in February of 2016 this area of Dublin,

243
00:14:35.410 --> 00:14:36.990
along with the rest of the country,

244
00:14:36.991 --> 00:14:41.940
w was holding their parliamentary elections elections for what they called t ds.

245
00:14:42.210 --> 00:14:45.610
Wait, what are tds? Okay, but TJ is the Irish, the gray.

246
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:47.220
Look for chuck to do all that,

247
00:14:47.490 --> 00:14:51.290
which translates into a member of parliament at that time. Dublin central head,

248
00:14:51.291 --> 00:14:55.340
three of these TD seats, three people representing them in parliament.

249
00:14:55.670 --> 00:15:00.670
One of them [inaudible] I was elected in 2009 was Maureen and I would be,

250
00:15:01.851 --> 00:15:05.090
I am independent, not allied with any party.

251
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.310
And going into that 2016 election,

252
00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:11.090
things were looking pretty uncertain for marine. Uh, first of all,

253
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:16.120
there was a field of 15 candidates running for those three seats in worse seats.

254
00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:17.640
One and two, uh,

255
00:15:17.990 --> 00:15:22.490
were expected to be snagged quite easily by these two high profile major party

256
00:15:22.491 --> 00:15:26.960
candidates. This again is ab Bowman who actually covered this 2016 election.

257
00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:28.131
They're, they're not locked down,

258
00:15:28.131 --> 00:15:30.530
but these are people who look like they are going to get elected.

259
00:15:30.710 --> 00:15:34.970
And what that means is you've got this wide open field of folks all fighting

260
00:15:34.971 --> 00:15:39.230
against marine for that third and final seat who is our contenders will, right.

261
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:40.850
So we're gonna focus in on two of them.

262
00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.640
Can I just get you to introduce yourself? So I'm Mary Fitzpatrick first.

263
00:15:46.641 --> 00:15:51.080
We've got married Fitzpatrick on the spectrum of American politics.

264
00:15:51.081 --> 00:15:55.950
Do you know where you fall? You just have two Parsons,

265
00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:59.340
she's pretty liberal. Been around Irish politics for awhile.

266
00:15:59.530 --> 00:16:04.130
And you went through Naomi already. Okay. Or on second. Gary Gannon,

267
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:08.150
who's a young community worker, this brash guy with red stubble on his face.

268
00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:09.440
Quite interesting quote, authentic.

269
00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:12.350
And he's sort of an interesting one to watch because he's representing this

270
00:16:12.351 --> 00:16:15.010
brand new political party, a plucky upstart.

271
00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:18.430
I think that's what they call it in the West Wing. And uh,

272
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.790
did you have a slogan or anything like, Oh yes. No. What an amazing slogan.

273
00:16:22.820 --> 00:16:24.950
It was very simple and it was just the one word.

274
00:16:26.100 --> 00:16:26.933
<v 2>If,</v>

275
00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.570
<v 7>oh, I started completely from an old fable about when the Macedonian army was</v>

276
00:16:33.571 --> 00:16:38.571
marching on Sparta and they send spire to a message saying that if we,

277
00:16:40.020 --> 00:16:41.490
when we were born Sparta to the ground,

278
00:16:41.491 --> 00:16:43.980
we will enslave your women and kill your children.

279
00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.230
Inspired to send back room more message, you're saying?

280
00:16:47.650 --> 00:16:48.800
<v 2>Yes, yes.</v>

281
00:16:50.090 --> 00:16:51.440
<v 6>Like I said, Brash.</v>

282
00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:56.390
And then you've got other voices who are left wing or environmentalist or, or,

283
00:16:56.391 --> 00:16:58.480
or others. So that's our field. All right.

284
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:00.680
And now here's how things actually work.

285
00:17:00.710 --> 00:17:04.700
Over in Ireland I was saying is underway in the Republic of Ireland as the

286
00:17:04.701 --> 00:17:08.630
country elects 157 new members of its parliament.

287
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:13.160
So Day of the election comes as a, as an Irish citizen,

288
00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:16.610
you walk into the voting booth and it's a very,

289
00:17:16.611 --> 00:17:20.900
very long ballot because it has all of the candidates, all 15 of them,

290
00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.140
their photo, their name, and then align next to them.

291
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.650
And this ballot is a key component of that updated Irish laptop of democracy.

292
00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:34.190
Uh, because instead of just filling in the circle next to one of those 15,

293
00:17:34.520 --> 00:17:38.990
you say, my number one choice is this guy. My number two choice is this lady.

294
00:17:39.140 --> 00:17:40.580
My number three choices, this person.

295
00:17:40.730 --> 00:17:44.180
And you can go all the way down the [inaudible] giving preferences to as many

296
00:17:44.181 --> 00:17:45.320
different people as you like.

297
00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:51.150
You write in a number next to each candidate. How about one man, one vote.

298
00:17:51.930 --> 00:17:56.790
Got It. Well, uh, it's still one man, one vote. We can't be no, it is. It is.

299
00:17:56.791 --> 00:17:58.650
It is. It is. And at the end of the day,

300
00:17:58.651 --> 00:18:03.300
your vote will only have counted for one person. However, in the voting process,

301
00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.320
you're not just measuring what everyone's first choice.

302
00:18:06.510 --> 00:18:08.190
It's like you might have a favorite choice,

303
00:18:08.430 --> 00:18:11.070
but you're not totally equal about the other three choices.

304
00:18:11.550 --> 00:18:13.650
And what this system allows us to do is to reflect that.

305
00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:16.710
It allows you to say how you feel about the rest of the candidates.

306
00:18:16.950 --> 00:18:19.650
And if your first choice doesn't make it,

307
00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:23.250
if he or she is way down the list and out of the running,

308
00:18:23.490 --> 00:18:27.120
then your vote lives on in the form of your second choice.

309
00:18:27.150 --> 00:18:30.330
So for as long as there's a viable candidate with your number on it,

310
00:18:30.420 --> 00:18:32.400
your vote will stay alive in the system. Is,

311
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:36.360
is this too early for me to raise a f a warning flag? Or you can wave.

312
00:18:36.361 --> 00:18:39.150
I may ignore it, but let's see it or hear it. The,

313
00:18:39.151 --> 00:18:43.950
the commitment that people make to voting is slight.

314
00:18:44.370 --> 00:18:47.910
Most of us are into lunch, sports work,

315
00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.760
and then maybe on the day of a vote, they have their best friends.

316
00:18:50.761 --> 00:18:52.990
So you got to vote for Sally. Like they no one, they,

317
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:54.930
they're not even gonna know. Seven. Yeah.

318
00:18:55.110 --> 00:19:00.110
So the first smell of this is it would take us more time than we want and we

319
00:19:00.331 --> 00:19:03.840
might walk away from this exercise because we don't feel prepared.

320
00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.170
You can engage with this on whatever level you'd like. Robert,

321
00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:09.000
if you only know one candidate's name,

322
00:19:09.030 --> 00:19:12.510
you can just put your one next to that person and hand in your ballot.

323
00:19:12.511 --> 00:19:15.930
And you're done. Or let's say there's a candidate on there you really,

324
00:19:15.931 --> 00:19:18.390
really don't like, you can leave them off the Polish entirely.

325
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:23.610
You're ranking your preferences. It's very simple, fairly good answer.

326
00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:26.280
Okay, so let me walk you through how this plays out.

327
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:30.330
So polls closed at 10:00 PM on Friday,

328
00:19:30.510 --> 00:19:32.800
February 26th and then

329
00:19:34.260 --> 00:19:37.530
<v 8>Dan all hell broke general election,</v>

330
00:19:37.531 --> 00:19:39.570
2016 on RTE radio,

331
00:19:39.571 --> 00:19:42.570
one with Rachel English and Sean are real action begins.

332
00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:45.290
It's going to be a dre of drama, shocks and surprises.

333
00:19:45.510 --> 00:19:49.620
So what happens is we vote on the Friday and on Saturday morning the votes

334
00:19:49.650 --> 00:19:52.170
actually get counted for Dublin Central.

335
00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:56.520
Dublin central gets counted in one central location, which is the rds.

336
00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:00.060
Let's go first to Ireland's largest count center, the rds,

337
00:20:00.180 --> 00:20:02.760
the Royal Dublin society. Sean, thank you very much.

338
00:20:02.850 --> 00:20:07.470
Welcome indeed to the rds where we're barn like building with big vaulted

339
00:20:07.970 --> 00:20:10.200
feeling big, big hole, huge amount of noise.

340
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:14.140
[inaudible]

341
00:20:14.140 --> 00:20:17.520
we'll let them realize they're going to go to them post traumatic trauma of the

342
00:20:17.630 --> 00:20:20.190
whole thing of going to black than now. No, I'm joking. I actually was lovely.

343
00:20:20.310 --> 00:20:25.310
The doors open at nine o'clock and I arrived this big throng arriving.

344
00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:27.810
This is male male, Mark Cuban.

345
00:20:27.930 --> 00:20:32.370
He's a campaign worker for our endangered incumbent, Maureen Moreno Sullivan.

346
00:20:32.670 --> 00:20:33.930
And on the morning of the count,

347
00:20:33.931 --> 00:20:36.960
as he pushed his way through these heavy wooden doors,

348
00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:40.890
what he would've seen was this cavernous hall filled with people milling about.

349
00:20:40.950 --> 00:20:44.580
Everybody's got clipboards. There's people with tons of sandwiches,

350
00:20:44.581 --> 00:20:48.040
made tea and coffee in abundance and everybody's really excited.

351
00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:49.900
And so shortly after nine o'clock,

352
00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:54.790
all the boxes come in these giant metal boxes of ballots [inaudible] so the

353
00:20:54.791 --> 00:20:56.530
boxes are opened. Literally,

354
00:20:56.560 --> 00:21:01.560
they're lifted up and there is a cascade and the spilling of all this paper

355
00:21:02.590 --> 00:21:06.670
because it's all done by paper. Voting weight.

356
00:21:06.820 --> 00:21:08.050
<v 6>What? Yeah,</v>

357
00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:12.580
we try to electronic voting in this country and we didn't like it because it was

358
00:21:12.581 --> 00:21:13.600
very fast.

359
00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.450
And I think we realized that the drama of an election and and also the,

360
00:21:18.590 --> 00:21:22.450
the ritual of democracy gets everybody engaged and gets people watching.

361
00:21:22.980 --> 00:21:24.810
<v 8>It's like watching a sport, a big sports game.</v>

362
00:21:24.811 --> 00:21:27.010
You don't want it to be over in five minutes. They're off.

363
00:21:28.110 --> 00:21:30.510
And so time now for our live update,

364
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:34.020
I have to warn as we always do at this time on this day,

365
00:21:34.021 --> 00:21:35.520
we're talking tallies first of all,

366
00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:40.470
which obviously can skew the results not just at the rds and not just for Dublin

367
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:40.471
Central,

368
00:21:40.471 --> 00:21:45.060
but all across the country vote cancers or dumping boxes of votes and going

369
00:21:45.061 --> 00:21:48.960
through them and putting them into stacks. First in Kilkenny is Justin McCarthy.

370
00:21:49.260 --> 00:21:51.460
Rougher bundles in no particular order,

371
00:21:51.510 --> 00:21:56.170
75% of the boxes have been tallied here and they include early on here at the

372
00:21:56.530 --> 00:22:00.330
counter. They're just trying to get a handle on how many first choice votes each

373
00:22:00.331 --> 00:22:02.820
candidate is getting from Calvin Audrey Carver,

374
00:22:02.821 --> 00:22:07.620
100% of the boxes are open and and well the ballot counters are doing this and

375
00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:11.820
official count. There's another group of people standing next to them,

376
00:22:12.030 --> 00:22:16.920
the Atlantic way and Johnny guys doing their own unofficial calculations. Yes,

377
00:22:16.950 --> 00:22:21.640
definitely the tallyman. 88% of boxes opened on tallied court. North Central.

378
00:22:21.641 --> 00:22:24.390
All doctors open, all sheets tallied, tally tallyman.

379
00:22:24.420 --> 00:22:28.140
There are several of them put forward by each candidate and they're just looking

380
00:22:28.141 --> 00:22:30.450
over the railings waiting for you to torn that ballot.

381
00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:34.110
Brash up started Gary Gannon again today can share though the name of the

382
00:22:34.111 --> 00:22:37.970
prison. They got the number one preference healing Gannon,

383
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.410
number one Gannon gallery,

384
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:43.890
and they're just counting them up and what they're counting is that number one?

385
00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:48.450
Yes. They're shouting out and telling the first choice labeled on each ballot so

386
00:22:48.451 --> 00:22:50.850
you'll have it understand why they got the racist,

387
00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:53.810
<v 6>which [inaudible]</v>

388
00:22:53.810 --> 00:22:55.030
<v 8>seemed like Gary, what?</v>

389
00:22:55.150 --> 00:22:58.840
We have a 98% Holly and there is a growing belief here that the third seat will

390
00:22:58.841 --> 00:23:01.840
be between Gary Gannon and he was getting a lot of birth preferences,

391
00:23:01.930 --> 00:23:04.660
so I walked in, I got pulled over,

392
00:23:04.661 --> 00:23:07.000
but one of our national newspapers to do an interview.

393
00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.950
Let's bring Gary Gannon in. How you, Gary,

394
00:23:08.951 --> 00:23:11.170
it's too early to be saying you're over the line butcher.

395
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.620
You're going well and God is far too early.

396
00:23:13.621 --> 00:23:16.090
I think all the radio researchers are coming over, grabbing me,

397
00:23:16.330 --> 00:23:18.460
bringing me over to speak on the radio. There's a bunch of,

398
00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:22.690
you've done 9% as well, so we could be in for another dog fight there.

399
00:23:22.810 --> 00:23:25.480
Absolutely. Yeah. I've counseled my weekend plans. I think I'll be,

400
00:23:25.780 --> 00:23:29.400
I think I'll be here for a awhile. It was genuine, real noise,

401
00:23:29.401 --> 00:23:30.640
sense of excitement,

402
00:23:30.830 --> 00:23:33.380
<v 6>but not for everyone.</v>

403
00:23:33.381 --> 00:23:36.590
So that morning I was at home doing different things. Again,

404
00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:40.250
this is incumbent Moreno Sullivan, but what did you do? Did you make breakfast?

405
00:23:40.251 --> 00:23:41.480
Did you go for a walk? Did I had,

406
00:23:41.481 --> 00:23:44.730
I had my breakfast and I walked the dog and um,

407
00:23:45.530 --> 00:23:49.520
white fluffy dog and his name is Bailey.

408
00:23:49.580 --> 00:23:52.430
So I brought him for a walk or you listening to the radio?

409
00:23:52.610 --> 00:23:54.920
You're totally disconnected. Yeah, pretty much.

410
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:59.810
I let my campaigners go over to be part of the Itali campaigners.

411
00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:02.800
It's starting to kind of including Mel. So

412
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:07.060
<v 8>within, within the first hour from some of the tallies that we were seeing,</v>

413
00:24:08.090 --> 00:24:08.923
um,

414
00:24:08.990 --> 00:24:09.190
<v 6>[inaudible]</v>

415
00:24:09.190 --> 00:24:13.960
<v 8>you know what I mean? Like Maria isn't, isn't picking up I no floats.</v>

416
00:24:14.320 --> 00:24:14.951
I'm saying, Oh,

417
00:24:14.951 --> 00:24:18.670
I hope this is not going to be an early day where there's no need for you to

418
00:24:18.671 --> 00:24:22.120
hang around because nobody's in the race any longer.

419
00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:26.730
<v 6>Um, and then I think I was driving when I got the first call from, um,</v>

420
00:24:26.880 --> 00:24:30.720
my campaigners over in the, the count saying it's not looking good.

421
00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:32.430
Beautiful was elected.

422
00:24:32.431 --> 00:24:36.300
Let's go back now to the busiest count center of the mall to Mary Wilson and the

423
00:24:36.301 --> 00:24:40.620
RTS. Rachel, thank you very much. A first count imminent,

424
00:24:40.621 --> 00:24:43.320
we believe here in Dublin Central. Meanwhile,

425
00:24:43.530 --> 00:24:48.150
the counter is take all those ballots now officially sorted by first preference

426
00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:53.280
and they pick up the stack for each candidate on the table and walk that stack

427
00:24:53.281 --> 00:24:56.310
back to this wooden shelving unit again.

428
00:24:57.130 --> 00:24:59.690
Mary-Faith Patrick behind the tables. I had a little bit of a distance in the,

429
00:24:59.691 --> 00:25:00.524
in the center,

430
00:25:01.110 --> 00:25:06.110
this giant third of Cubby pigeonholed just like light flimsy wooden boxes.

431
00:25:06.930 --> 00:25:10.800
And this is the sacred shrine of Irish democracy on this day.

432
00:25:13.140 --> 00:25:16.290
The cabi absolutely. Because,

433
00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.440
because when they've counted all of the first preference votes,

434
00:25:19.441 --> 00:25:21.450
they placed them all in their respective cubbies.

435
00:25:21.610 --> 00:25:26.610
<v 8>There's a hush in that part of out the arena and the returning officer stands up</v>

436
00:25:26.770 --> 00:25:31.770
on a stage with a microphone and goes following is the result of one here is the

437
00:25:33.071 --> 00:25:37.600
first count for the constituency of Dublin central 68, 66.

438
00:25:37.630 --> 00:25:41.330
And they read out every candidate how many number one votes did they get?

439
00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:45.070
21 to zero. And uh, first off the bat

440
00:25:45.210 --> 00:25:46.200
<v 6>at the end of the first count,</v>

441
00:25:46.230 --> 00:25:49.920
first and second are pretty much locked down with the two people everybody

442
00:25:49.921 --> 00:25:51.270
expected to with. But, but, but,

443
00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:55.530
but then in third place unexpectedly is Mary Fitzpatrick. Yeah. I,

444
00:25:55.531 --> 00:25:59.010
I mean I was very pleased to be in third position on the first count.

445
00:25:59.190 --> 00:26:04.060
Now with our system of voting at this point, you're done. The,

446
00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:05.480
the election is over. Uh,

447
00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.420
the two front runner candidates would have each one a seat and then Mary

448
00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:13.230
Fitzpatrick would have went to see Gary and Maureen. They'd be out done.

449
00:26:13.320 --> 00:26:18.000
But in Ireland, not so in Ireland, they're just getting started.

450
00:26:18.690 --> 00:26:22.110
So back to the race. And remember at this moment,

451
00:26:22.530 --> 00:26:25.110
Mary Fitzpatrick is in third, Gary is in fifth,

452
00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:29.580
and in seventh at that stage I was listening to the radio and I knew what they

453
00:26:29.581 --> 00:26:34.360
were saying about Dublin central is incumbent, Moreno Sullivan. Okay. Um,

454
00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:35.220
represented,

455
00:26:35.220 --> 00:26:39.050
appears almost certain that Joe Costello and Moreno Sullivan are set to lose

456
00:26:39.290 --> 00:26:43.290
that myself and Joe Castello, you're out. I had some y,

457
00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:44.790
y because of the numbers.

458
00:26:44.910 --> 00:26:49.470
I think the feeling was I was too far down that first preference to come back

459
00:26:49.471 --> 00:26:51.200
up. But then looking at the earlier,

460
00:26:51.330 --> 00:26:54.780
the results coming in from around the country. Like I said, it's not over yet.

461
00:26:55.090 --> 00:26:56.670
So the way the votes progress is this,

462
00:26:56.730 --> 00:27:01.290
the sheriff or the presiding officers starts to eliminate candidates.

463
00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:04.170
The first elimination is the bottom three candidates.

464
00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:08.640
Those candidacies are gone and in the bin since Gary's in fifth and marines in

465
00:27:08.641 --> 00:27:13.470
seventh, they're safe for now. But the bottom three candidates, they're gone.

466
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:14.423
Why three?

467
00:27:14.430 --> 00:27:19.430
Because they are so far out that mathematically they could never come back.

468
00:27:20.310 --> 00:27:23.010
Between the three of them, they've only got like 150 votes.

469
00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:26.310
So we get rid of all three of them and redistribute those ballots.

470
00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:29.070
So if you voted for those people, they just go, okay,

471
00:27:29.100 --> 00:27:31.860
who did you vote for as your second choice?

472
00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:36.000
And the point is your vote is still live and is still part of this election.

473
00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:42.000
And so that was 150 votes. Those hundred and 50 ballots,

474
00:27:42.390 --> 00:27:46.650
they begin to do this sort of ballet, the roll in these pigeonholes,

475
00:27:46.990 --> 00:27:47.850
everything is visible.

476
00:27:47.880 --> 00:27:52.830
The vote counters walk back to that shrine to that cubby and pull the balance

477
00:27:52.831 --> 00:27:55.680
from the cubby holes for those three candidates.

478
00:27:56.010 --> 00:27:58.560
Then march these ballots back to to the front table,

479
00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:03.330
sort them then into bundles of second preference on the ballot.

480
00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:07.380
So now you've got stacks for every candidate that was listed as a second choice

481
00:28:07.410 --> 00:28:08.243
and we distribute them,

482
00:28:08.310 --> 00:28:12.090
they take them back to the cubby where they are then added to the remaining

483
00:28:12.091 --> 00:28:16.050
candidates first preferences, and that becomes the second count.

484
00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.450
Okay. Okay.

485
00:28:18.451 --> 00:28:22.620
So what they want is everybody who voted to the degree that it is possible

486
00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:27.360
should maybe be participating in electing somebody to the legislature. Exactly.

487
00:28:27.720 --> 00:28:30.350
All right. So excuse me. What time is it now? Ah,

488
00:28:30.390 --> 00:28:33.060
we're probably middle of the afternoon at this point. And when did we start?

489
00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:38.120
We started at nine in the morning. Okay. Point taken. People are tired.

490
00:28:38.640 --> 00:28:42.960
No, no, no. Blaming people. I am now watching this program for five hours.

491
00:28:42.961 --> 00:28:44.100
That's a long time.

492
00:28:44.130 --> 00:28:49.130
I will challenge your statement that just because a competition unfolds slowly

493
00:28:50.130 --> 00:28:54.240
that it is without drama or suspense. All right.

494
00:28:54.810 --> 00:28:57.600
I'm sorry that we were making this so hard for you. That's fine.

495
00:28:57.750 --> 00:29:01.980
You are not making it easy for us. Anyway, back to the scene.

496
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:06.180
Dublin central is reduced to three seats, so I'm looking at this going, okay.

497
00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:11.250
Mary Fitzpatrick, our candidate in third after the first count has 2,500 votes.

498
00:29:11.310 --> 00:29:14.340
Gary Gannon currently in fifth. He's only 200 votes behind her,

499
00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:17.970
and my instinct is he's going to be more transfer friendly.

500
00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.220
He's going to get more second choice votes than her.

501
00:29:20.340 --> 00:29:23.580
I think he could overtake her and I start watching her where the transfers are

502
00:29:23.581 --> 00:29:26.550
going and I start to be proven right.

503
00:29:27.400 --> 00:29:31.680
If the Social Democrats did very well on transfers to Kent, to Gary.

504
00:29:31.681 --> 00:29:34.740
Gannon is getting 20 votes and then if it's Patrick's only getting to,

505
00:29:35.290 --> 00:29:38.580
can't treat the whole process repeats, knock somebody out, do the ballot ballet,

506
00:29:38.581 --> 00:29:42.040
redistribute those transfers. Gary Gannon picks up 60 votes and money

507
00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:45.100
<v 8>if it's Patrick only picks up seven so he's gaining on it already there talking</v>

508
00:29:45.101 --> 00:29:47.860
about me. You're asking who is this going, where is he coming from?

509
00:29:48.070 --> 00:29:51.400
All these things. And then I was getting a phone call. Mary's stock is falling.

510
00:29:51.430 --> 00:29:54.880
Well Gary's Mary, Mary's stock is staying static. You know,

511
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:57.100
we were struggling for transfers. That was the issue.

512
00:29:57.101 --> 00:30:00.490
She's not going up much and the others are gaining on her. So yeah,

513
00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:02.170
it's painful. It's not pleasant.

514
00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:04.660
And bear in mind that you've still got other people picking up boats there.

515
00:30:04.780 --> 00:30:08.840
We're seeing little pickups from Maureen. Maureen picked up 49 push. No,

516
00:30:09.010 --> 00:30:11.740
not a lot. We're moving ahead slowly. Okay.

517
00:30:11.741 --> 00:30:15.910
We have a a Dublin center count count four again,

518
00:30:15.970 --> 00:30:19.360
eliminate the bottom candidate, redistribute those votes this time around.

519
00:30:19.390 --> 00:30:23.430
Really not much changes. Then count five, the next person going out.

520
00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:26.280
It's got 800 votes, 31 of them go to Mary Fitzpatrick,

521
00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:30.190
but also 190 of them go to go to Gary Gannon, Gary Gannon.

522
00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:34.660
I surprised a lot of people in disability to pick up transfers from and Gary

523
00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:36.070
Gannon has just jumped into fourth place.

524
00:30:37.390 --> 00:30:40.480
We've got quite a fight now in our hands. Be standings as they are,

525
00:30:40.750 --> 00:30:42.760
so at the places aren't married. Patrick in third place,

526
00:30:42.790 --> 00:30:47.020
she's just barely holding on in forth hot on her heels is Gary Gannon and then

527
00:30:47.021 --> 00:30:50.530
way at the back of the pack still in seventh is incumbent Moreno Sullivan.

528
00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:53.920
That's the state of play at ten five [inaudible] number six Oh, here we go.

529
00:30:53.921 --> 00:30:58.300
And continuing coverage. Mike, Mike and Gallaher don't these here guys. Hello,

530
00:30:58.301 --> 00:31:01.600
we're back. This is where two two big things happen.

531
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:03.910
Everybody's having their own conversations, obviously.

532
00:31:03.911 --> 00:31:07.540
One Mary Lou McDonald of Champagne and Mary Lou McDonald of Shin Fein.

533
00:31:07.570 --> 00:31:10.420
One of the front runners expected to take a seat, gets over the line.

534
00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:12.993
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

535
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:15.300
<v 8>also come walking around and just hug them people.</v>

536
00:31:15.990 --> 00:31:17.730
Gary Gannon now jumps into third place.

537
00:31:18.210 --> 00:31:22.530
It was invigorating pushing Mary Fitzpatrick out of a winning spot like that.

538
00:31:22.531 --> 00:31:26.580
It was on the transfers like got cost and that's it. Cheap never recaptured it.

539
00:31:26.970 --> 00:31:29.670
So the woman who under our system would have one off the bat.

540
00:31:30.030 --> 00:31:33.060
She lost out his age, you know,

541
00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:43.390
<v 6>still hanging on in second to last but but also disheartened is our incumbent</v>

542
00:31:43.420 --> 00:31:48.420
Moreno Sullivan who's expecting to lose and I suppose maybe seven o'clock people

543
00:31:48.821 --> 00:31:49.930
started to arrive.

544
00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:54.820
She actually invited her campaign staff and volunteers back to her place for a a

545
00:31:54.821 --> 00:31:57.520
concession party and I said, when people came in,

546
00:31:57.760 --> 00:32:01.180
I don't want to know anything about the elections. I'll catch up tomorrow.

547
00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:06.040
Unknown to me because I was busy with the tea and the the drinks and the foods.

548
00:32:06.610 --> 00:32:11.200
Some of them in the house were still in contact with those over in the rds

549
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:16.060
[inaudible] central constituency into our reporter Damien O'Mara. Damien,

550
00:32:16.061 --> 00:32:20.290
you have a development to report one of those guys still over in the rds was

551
00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:24.670
Mel. I did have a sense looking at the numbers and saying, well,

552
00:32:25.090 --> 00:32:30.010
okay Bush if, and then maybe

553
00:32:31.370 --> 00:32:34.390
<v 8>has the chance this a chance in this,</v>

554
00:32:36.360 --> 00:32:40.270
is that a crazy thought to have or a very smart thought to? Um,

555
00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:46.010
it was just a thought to have because despite the fact that all day the media

556
00:32:46.011 --> 00:32:47.450
had been saying that Maureen was out,

557
00:32:47.451 --> 00:32:51.590
Moreno Sullivan had to lose going to the Moreno Sarina Sullivan might be

558
00:32:51.591 --> 00:32:54.140
eliminated seven, something starts to happen.

559
00:32:55.640 --> 00:32:56.690
[inaudible] coming around the band,

560
00:32:56.691 --> 00:32:58.670
Gary Gannon looks like he's in poor position,

561
00:32:59.330 --> 00:33:01.540
but all of a sudden we weren't reallocating people's.

562
00:33:01.550 --> 00:33:03.500
Second preferences are the, toward preferences.

563
00:33:03.800 --> 00:33:06.740
We'd got to the stage where we're reallocating people's fourth, fifth,

564
00:33:06.741 --> 00:33:08.960
and sixth preferences. Because keep in mind,

565
00:33:09.020 --> 00:33:13.250
most people's votes are still flushing around the system. And at this point,

566
00:33:13.251 --> 00:33:15.500
not only has their top choice been knocked out,

567
00:33:15.620 --> 00:33:17.600
but they're second and third as well.

568
00:33:18.110 --> 00:33:22.910
So their vote is now being kept for their fourth, fifth, or sixth place choice.

569
00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:26.300
And a lot of those, they start going to Maureen.

570
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:29.420
She's known people for years had been elected twice previous to that.

571
00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:33.800
So even people who weren't involved from number one, number two number tree,

572
00:33:34.370 --> 00:33:38.450
their votes were still cardio on past the Fars and the [inaudible] and just

573
00:33:38.451 --> 00:33:41.900
mauled me on those transfers. So we go to candidate, the beginning to make it,

574
00:33:41.901 --> 00:33:45.590
but I've gotten into this straight marine makes this massive jump vaulting her

575
00:33:46.250 --> 00:33:49.610
ahead of two opponents into fourth place. Now,

576
00:33:49.640 --> 00:33:53.480
just a couple hundred votes behind. Gary, do you have any sense this? No, no,

577
00:33:53.540 --> 00:33:53.870
no,

578
00:33:53.870 --> 00:33:58.870
because I didn't have the television on and they decided not to tell me not to

579
00:33:59.331 --> 00:34:03.120
raise my hope from the ninth counter. At the moment, the ninth count,

580
00:34:03.350 --> 00:34:07.760
the situation is that another candidate is asked, they redistribute her votes.

581
00:34:07.910 --> 00:34:12.080
It's coming down, it's coming down to it. I'm going to count up those transfers.

582
00:34:12.390 --> 00:34:16.280
That means then that Gary Gannon is lucky to be elected or what's the situation

583
00:34:16.281 --> 00:34:20.390
there? Mikey dollar. Maureen get some 300 more transfers than Gary,

584
00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:25.250
meaning suddenly Gary Kaolin is precisely eight votes ahead of Marlene. Who?

585
00:34:25.251 --> 00:34:30.170
Sullivan. Oh my God. I did not see that coming. She's within eight votes of him.

586
00:34:31.160 --> 00:34:33.100
<v 6>I run quarter to 10,</v>

587
00:34:33.130 --> 00:34:36.460
but Maureen meanwhile is still convinced she's going to lose.

588
00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:39.970
She's actually heading down to the count center to concede the race.

589
00:34:40.030 --> 00:34:43.240
I said to myself, I should go over and concede. So um,

590
00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:47.530
came out into the car and as I'm driving over to concede,

591
00:34:47.800 --> 00:34:49.390
I was just at the traffic lights.

592
00:34:49.391 --> 00:34:52.360
I can picture it and at that stage the phone call comes,

593
00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.260
she looks at her phone and it's one of her campaign staff calls. I thought,

594
00:34:56.261 --> 00:34:59.560
why are they ringing me to hurry me up to get over or whatever.

595
00:34:59.680 --> 00:35:03.520
But in fact they were calling because in Dublin central, but Brian Darling,

596
00:35:03.710 --> 00:35:07.020
you been just as I mentioned your name Brian, we're going to Dublin

597
00:35:07.070 --> 00:35:08.810
<v 8>essentially. What last time up?</v>

598
00:35:08.870 --> 00:35:13.490
This is the results of the 11th count for Dublin Central

599
00:35:16.060 --> 00:35:19.990
and I deemed the following candidate to be elected and they are

600
00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:21.893
<v 1>Marino, Sullivan</v>

601
00:35:27.350 --> 00:35:27.470
[inaudible]

602
00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:31.700
<v 8>in her car. Maureen did eventually pick up and then it was, where are you?</v>

603
00:35:31.701 --> 00:35:35.360
You're about to be elected, going to be elected.

604
00:35:35.510 --> 00:35:38.070
She put down the phone, drove to the count center

605
00:35:38.280 --> 00:35:39.600
<v 6>and when she arrived,</v>

606
00:35:42.770 --> 00:35:44.970
<v 9>crazy applause. Great homes, great kisses. So,</v>

607
00:35:45.090 --> 00:35:50.090
and it was just a lovely explosion of feeling warm feelings towards me from

608
00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:54.260
everybody. Moreno Sullivan. Congratulations. Thank you very much.

609
00:35:54.261 --> 00:35:58.070
You're a very relieved woman. I'm a stoned woman. I was at home,

610
00:35:58.071 --> 00:36:02.210
reconciled to a new life outside of politics and then suddenly I'm back in the

611
00:36:02.211 --> 00:36:06.230
frame. We had thought that we were too far behind too. So I just said, look,

612
00:36:06.231 --> 00:36:07.670
I know who as Lazarus felt like

613
00:36:10.390 --> 00:36:10.700
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

614
00:36:10.700 --> 00:36:12.200
<v 9>it was, it was that kind of moment.</v>

615
00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:15.691
<v 6>Well, should we,</v>

616
00:36:15.691 --> 00:36:20.691
is this a story of a multi [inaudible] proportional representation by single

617
00:36:20.731 --> 00:36:24.180
transferable vote working? How exactly is it?

618
00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:27.180
It's meant to or is this sort of a perversion of the system?

619
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:28.560
<v 7>No, it absolutely is.</v>

620
00:36:28.670 --> 00:36:32.490
It work that they worked at exactly as single transferrable votes with men to

621
00:36:32.670 --> 00:36:32.890
do.

622
00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:35.350
<v 3>One last time, the gracious Gary Gannon,</v>

623
00:36:35.480 --> 00:36:39.050
<v 7>everybody got their cow. Everybody got their say and everybody got their vote.</v>

624
00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.610
And don't get me wrong when I say like it did Hort, but I mean,

625
00:36:43.611 --> 00:36:46.640
I was 28 29 then like there was a huge sense of like,

626
00:36:46.910 --> 00:36:51.560
we'll show you this language will be back. So single transferable vote on that.

627
00:36:51.561 --> 00:36:55.070
They worked against me. But you know, I think it worked out perfectly,

628
00:36:56.940 --> 00:37:01.380
<v 5>perfectly. I mean, let me just share if I get this right,</v>

629
00:37:01.890 --> 00:37:04.200
there's this woman Maureen,

630
00:37:05.190 --> 00:37:07.740
who hardly anybody loves,

631
00:37:08.010 --> 00:37:12.030
she's scores almost no votes as, as the favorite.

632
00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:16.380
She's just everybody's, you know, [inaudible] fourth, fifth, sixth. I'll choose

633
00:37:17.970 --> 00:37:21.570
Maureen Penn yet because the votes to keep getting shuffled and shovels and

634
00:37:21.571 --> 00:37:25.710
shoveled, it's mismatch. Who becomes the winner? Winner? She's,

635
00:37:25.711 --> 00:37:30.390
she's chosen because a lot of people don't hate her.

636
00:37:30.690 --> 00:37:32.880
Yeah. Well, so, ah, so he,

637
00:37:33.020 --> 00:37:34.820
<v 3>here's what it makes me think of. Right?</v>

638
00:37:34.821 --> 00:37:39.821
And I had this moment where I was just imagining if we had been using this at

639
00:37:40.311 --> 00:37:43.910
various crucial moments in our very recent history,

640
00:37:44.210 --> 00:37:47.210
things could have gone an entirely different way.

641
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:50.500
Take the American presidential election of 2016 okay.

642
00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:53.660
Between Hillary and Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton,

643
00:37:53.661 --> 00:37:58.610
but also Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. Right? He voted for them.

644
00:37:59.110 --> 00:38:03.110
Well, no, but hardly, hardly anybody. That number of hardly anybody is,

645
00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:04.010
that was,

646
00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:09.020
that's a sizable enough number that they could have swung the election one way

647
00:38:09.021 --> 00:38:13.910
or the other. If you look at really key states, the deciding states, uh,

648
00:38:14.090 --> 00:38:16.970
if you presume Gary Johnson's votes were split,

649
00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:20.060
and if you presume all of Jill Stein's votes went to Hillary Clinton,

650
00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.970
Hillary Clinton would have won Pennsylvania,

651
00:38:23.090 --> 00:38:26.640
Michigan and Wisconsin and the whole kit

652
00:38:27.090 --> 00:38:30.050
<v 5>kaboodle. Oh, that's interesting.</v>

653
00:38:30.490 --> 00:38:32.920
<v 3>Yeah. The weird thing is you can just keep playing this game and,</v>

654
00:38:32.950 --> 00:38:35.080
and it'll drive you crazy, but you can keep playing.

655
00:38:35.170 --> 00:38:40.170
So if you go back to the 2016 Republican primary is where Donald Trump emerged

656
00:38:40.421 --> 00:38:44.770
victorious, right? Over 10 people or something like that. Over 10 people. Right?

657
00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:49.210
But there was a sizable number of people in those primaries who were never

658
00:38:49.211 --> 00:38:50.044
Trumpers.

659
00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:54.520
If those people hadn't been able to block their votes together,

660
00:38:54.610 --> 00:38:56.460
they might've been able to, uh,

661
00:38:56.650 --> 00:38:59.290
rally behind a candidate who was not Donald Trump.

662
00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:04.240
And then rewind even further back to the 2000 election where the number of votes

663
00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:07.930
that Ralph Nader got in Florida were more than the difference between Bush Scott

664
00:39:07.931 --> 00:39:11.710
and Gorgon. No, elected elect the Republican. Can you, okay, so, so,

665
00:39:11.711 --> 00:39:14.320
so go back to Ross Perot, right?

666
00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:18.700
A George h w Bush was running against Bill Clinton in 1992, uh,

667
00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:19.990
Ross Perot.

668
00:39:19.991 --> 00:39:23.470
It's very controversial whether he really was a spoiler in that election,

669
00:39:23.471 --> 00:39:27.760
but I mean if you ask the the Bush people, they say he definitely was.

670
00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:31.990
And so if the parolers went to Bush that then like Bill Clinton would've just

671
00:39:31.991 --> 00:39:34.900
been a historical footnote. He wouldn't have been the president. Like,

672
00:39:35.050 --> 00:39:37.780
it's like a huge, huge seismic difference

673
00:39:38.410 --> 00:39:39.460
<v 4>in world history.</v>

674
00:39:42.880 --> 00:39:44.830
So when we come back,

675
00:39:45.070 --> 00:39:48.400
we're not going to be looking at my own imaginative math.

676
00:39:48.401 --> 00:39:52.180
We're going to look at what is ranked choice actually look like if there was in

677
00:39:52.181 --> 00:39:56.230
the United States, because it is in the United States. That's about to happen.

678
00:39:56.910 --> 00:39:57.760
Yeah. Let me come back.

679
00:39:58.990 --> 00:40:01.420
<v 10>Hi, my name is Corey and I'm from Minneapolis, Minnesota.</v>

<v 3>welcome back. I am Robert Krulwich.</v>

684
00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:25.270
I'm lot's of Nasr and this is radio lab and we are trying to fix democracy in

685
00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.360
this hour in little bits and pieces. Yeah. So let me,

686
00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:32.110
let me just back up for a second because we have been talking about this and

687
00:40:32.111 --> 00:40:37.111
thinking about this around the office for for a little while and at some point

688
00:40:37.421 --> 00:40:42.340
as we were, as we were kind of meditating on this dwindling faith in democracy,

689
00:40:42.341 --> 00:40:45.880
one of our fellow producers at our sister show more. Perfect. Okay.

690
00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:50.740
Sakari she just took me and Simon. Great, great.

691
00:40:50.830 --> 00:40:52.360
And just dragged us into a studio.

692
00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:53.990
<v 11>Okay. So um,</v>

693
00:40:54.110 --> 00:40:59.110
we've been having this conversation about whether our democracy is broken for

694
00:40:59.961 --> 00:41:03.410
like a few months now. And like every meeting that we've had,

695
00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:07.100
I've been the one in the room being like, guys are democracies fine?

696
00:41:07.101 --> 00:41:10.190
Like have you seen other places, this is crazy. Like,

697
00:41:10.191 --> 00:41:14.540
who are these people that think like our democracy is broken?

698
00:41:14.541 --> 00:41:17.090
Like they don't know what they're talking about.

699
00:41:17.150 --> 00:41:20.300
<v 3>And do you know why? Like where, where, where's that feeling coming from?</v>

700
00:41:22.200 --> 00:41:25.290
<v 11>Well, uh, okay. Can you tell me your name? Uh,</v>

701
00:41:25.730 --> 00:41:29.780
[inaudible] and who are you? Probably because of this woman. Oh, I'm was,

702
00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:35.870
I was ma how you in relation to me? Oh, I'm your mom.

703
00:41:35.960 --> 00:41:40.430
My mom and both of my parents actually grew up in Pakistan.

704
00:41:40.460 --> 00:41:45.460
That is the beginning 25 years of my life where I spent and I feel,

705
00:41:46.110 --> 00:41:49.640
which is a pretty young country and it's,

706
00:41:49.730 --> 00:41:54.730
it's just struggled so much to keep its democracy alive and healthy.

707
00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.370
And, uh, I, I saw and, uh,

708
00:42:00.530 --> 00:42:05.530
the consequences of not getting the full damn democracy there in Pakistan.

709
00:42:06.440 --> 00:42:08.450
Uh, so that, uh,

710
00:42:08.451 --> 00:42:13.010
then after living 25 year of next 25 years of my life in America,

711
00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:18.400
I really found out the value of democracy as an individual and a,

712
00:42:19.130 --> 00:42:21.980
as a, as a group also. So that like,

713
00:42:22.040 --> 00:42:26.210
I can differentiate now very well between the, those two.

714
00:42:27.320 --> 00:42:32.030
So that's kind of how I've always understood our democracy.

715
00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.250
Um, but then Simon,

716
00:42:34.251 --> 00:42:39.251
I listened to your Ireland story with all of this rank choice voting stuff and,

717
00:42:39.380 --> 00:42:43.880
and that's the first moment when I was like, oh,

718
00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:49.030
like maybe maybe our way of doing things is broken.

719
00:42:49.731 --> 00:42:51.560
Like maybe we do need an app.

720
00:42:51.790 --> 00:42:53.400
<v 3>Okay. And okay. Why, what,</v>

721
00:42:53.850 --> 00:42:57.350
what about it made you switch teams?

722
00:42:57.840 --> 00:42:59.520
<v 11>Because um,</v>

723
00:42:59.760 --> 00:43:04.760
it made me suddenly aware of the fact that in our system candidates don't

724
00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:09.630
actually need a majority of the votes to win. Right. So you,

725
00:43:10.050 --> 00:43:13.380
you have candidates who then make that calculation where they say,

726
00:43:13.650 --> 00:43:18.300
I only really have to win the votes of people who are in my base.

727
00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:23.220
And if that's, if those, if my base is bigger than everybody else's base,

728
00:43:23.430 --> 00:43:25.140
then like screw everyone else. Yeah.

729
00:43:25.480 --> 00:43:27.190
<v 3>It seems like in a democracy,</v>

730
00:43:27.250 --> 00:43:31.660
most people should vote for the person who wins,

731
00:43:31.690 --> 00:43:36.160
not just that the person who wins is going to have the biggest base to like a

732
00:43:36.161 --> 00:43:37.930
bigger base than everybody else.

733
00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.700
Like it should be that most people are in some way in some preference supporting

734
00:43:42.701 --> 00:43:43.660
the person who comes to power.

735
00:43:43.730 --> 00:43:48.710
<v 11>Yeah, exactly. And it's funny, like when I heard about rank choice voting,</v>

736
00:43:48.711 --> 00:43:53.360
I was like, oh, like this system is so cool because it,

737
00:43:54.140 --> 00:43:58.570
it's, I feel like it addresses that exact problem. And so I,

738
00:43:58.620 --> 00:44:03.620
I totally got sucked into it and I started looking around and it turns out there

739
00:44:04.431 --> 00:44:09.431
are a bunch of people who think that this could be used here in the u s and not

740
00:44:10.311 --> 00:44:14.330
only that, it already is. And when I asked around, uh,

741
00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:19.610
a number of people pointed to this moment in 2000 with the election when, uh,

742
00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.010
Bush loses the popular election,

743
00:44:22.040 --> 00:44:25.940
but he wins because he wins in Florida. Um,

744
00:44:26.090 --> 00:44:27.470
and so people look at the,

745
00:44:27.471 --> 00:44:32.471
the results in Florida and see that a bunch of votes that might have gone to Al

746
00:44:32.700 --> 00:44:36.930
Gore, they go instead to Ralph Nader who then becomes,

747
00:44:37.320 --> 00:44:39.750
you know, sort of notorious as this spoiler,

748
00:44:39.751 --> 00:44:42.990
that that may be ruined the election for Al Gore.

749
00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:45.510
And after 2000 at that point,

750
00:44:45.511 --> 00:44:49.590
you do see some cities that start to adopt rank choice voting at the local

751
00:44:49.591 --> 00:44:51.770
level. And so what I did is,

752
00:44:52.590 --> 00:44:55.890
<v 3>um, okay, I'm putting my phone on airplane mode.</v>

753
00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.560
<v 11>I grabbed Latif and we kind of did this.</v>

754
00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.910
I'm like cross country rank choice voting tour. Um,

755
00:45:02.970 --> 00:45:07.320
and the first place we're gonna start with Hello San Francisco.

756
00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:11.840
<v 3>Yes. San Francisco is here is San Francisco. Is this Dominic? Yes, it is.</v>

757
00:45:11.930 --> 00:45:14.330
Oh hey Dominic, what's up? Hi. What's up?

758
00:45:14.840 --> 00:45:18.850
So this is Dominic for Casa check. Check. Check. Yeah, he,

759
00:45:18.870 --> 00:45:22.220
he used to do radio. You got the pipes for it, Dominic. Hey,

760
00:45:22.221 --> 00:45:25.610
let me know if you need any ad spots so we can get right to it, you know. Okay,

761
00:45:25.611 --> 00:45:26.444
cool.

762
00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:29.910
<v 11>But he, uh, now he's a reporter at the San Francisco Chronicle.</v>

763
00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:33.050
<v 12>I'm a city hall reporter for the Chronicle. Yes.</v>

764
00:45:33.051 --> 00:45:38.051
So the very first rank choice election in San Francisco happened in 2004,

765
00:45:38.550 --> 00:45:41.770
um, but it was actually a ranked choice. Voting became, uh,

766
00:45:41.771 --> 00:45:45.150
I guess the city's method or the city system, if you will. Uh,

767
00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:49.930
back in 2002 where there was a, a ballot initiative that was passed by voters.

768
00:45:50.890 --> 00:45:51.940
Um, uh, that said like, look,

769
00:45:51.941 --> 00:45:54.820
this is going to be the system that we're going to implement going forward.

770
00:45:54.970 --> 00:45:59.950
So the vast majority of local elected offices are chosen with,

771
00:45:59.980 --> 00:46:01.330
with rank choice contest.

772
00:46:01.790 --> 00:46:03.080
<v 11>So City Council,</v>

773
00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:07.490
<v 3>the Board of Supervisors, the school board, um, our like assessor recorder</v>

774
00:46:07.590 --> 00:46:10.200
<v 11>and in one very specific election,</v>

775
00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.580
<v 12>the case in the mayor's race,</v>

776
00:46:12.010 --> 00:46:14.560
<v 11>the case in the mayor's race.</v>

777
00:46:14.730 --> 00:46:17.280
<v 12>Okay, great. I can't believe this was just a few months ago.</v>

778
00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:20.580
It seems like a long time ago at this point. Um,

779
00:46:20.830 --> 00:46:25.570
<v 11>okay, so early 2018, the San Francisco mayor's race kicked off</v>

780
00:46:25.600 --> 00:46:27.400
<v 12>and when it really kicked into gear,</v>

781
00:46:27.430 --> 00:46:31.210
there were three leading candidates you had.

782
00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:34.290
<v 11>Hi, I'm board of supervisors President London breed,</v>

783
00:46:34.350 --> 00:46:38.340
<v 12>London breed. Um, and you had, hello,</v>

784
00:46:38.580 --> 00:46:41.670
I'm Mark Leno, former San Francisco supervisor, Mark Leno.

785
00:46:43.310 --> 00:46:47.840
And you had, hi, I'm Jane Kim, occurrence supervisor Jane Kim.

786
00:46:48.140 --> 00:46:52.430
And these aren't, these are all democrats who the field of candidates is

787
00:46:52.530 --> 00:46:56.360
<v 3>set now. KPIX five Joe Vasquez. Okay.</v>

788
00:46:56.760 --> 00:47:00.600
So out of the gate, new front runner in the San Francisco mayor's race,

789
00:47:01.020 --> 00:47:01.720
London breed.

790
00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:06.070
<v 11>This campaign is a winning campaign. She was the more moderate,</v>

791
00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:07.280
more established candidate,

792
00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:11.500
but she's getting one egg of a bounce in the polls and she hit a fairly strong

793
00:47:11.501 --> 00:47:13.870
lead and a lot of wind in her sails.

794
00:47:14.080 --> 00:47:16.750
Two to one leap over her two closest rivals,

795
00:47:16.930 --> 00:47:20.770
the more Glen [inaudible] and Jane Kim and as the campaign made his way to

796
00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:25.120
election day, things were going pretty well. We are winners. It was almost like,

797
00:47:25.240 --> 00:47:27.070
sure there are three names on the ballot,

798
00:47:27.130 --> 00:47:28.960
but at the end of the day it was more like

799
00:47:29.310 --> 00:47:31.200
<v 12>breed London greed and London breed.</v>

800
00:47:31.380 --> 00:47:34.990
<v 11>It's a framework. There's a reason falls heading into Tuesday's election,</v>

801
00:47:35.500 --> 00:47:36.333
but then

802
00:47:37.620 --> 00:47:42.620
<v 5>right before the election something happened that you basically never see in</v>

803
00:47:44.131 --> 00:47:44.964
American politics.

804
00:47:46.880 --> 00:47:51.870
<v 13>We are proud to stand together to say that we are United in our belief that we</v>

805
00:47:51.871 --> 00:47:55.620
need fundamental change here in the city and county of San Francisco.

806
00:47:56.070 --> 00:48:01.020
<v 11>In the very last few weeks before election day, the the two underdogs,</v>

807
00:48:01.050 --> 00:48:02.970
Jane, Kim and Mark Leno,

808
00:48:03.420 --> 00:48:06.060
they held a press conference on the steps of City Hall.

809
00:48:06.290 --> 00:48:08.960
<v 13>Mark and I are opponents as everyone knows.</v>

810
00:48:09.420 --> 00:48:13.030
<v 12>They stood outside. City Hall literally joined hands and said,</v>

811
00:48:13.160 --> 00:48:17.920
<v 13>I'm proud to be the first set of candidates to truly take advantage of the rank</v>

812
00:48:17.921 --> 00:48:22.870
choice voting system and encourage our supporters to vote for both of us.

813
00:48:24.600 --> 00:48:29.040
<v 5>Wait a sec. So what you say is vote for me definitely built from me,</v>

814
00:48:29.220 --> 00:48:34.190
but also vote for this guy who I'm running against. Yeah, exactly.

815
00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:35.440
<v 12>Vote for me first,</v>

816
00:48:35.441 --> 00:48:38.770
but vote for Jane second or vote for me first and vote for mark second.

817
00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:43.080
<v 11>So like if one of us were to come in last, like let's say mark comes in last,</v>

818
00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.280
if all the people who voted for him ranked Jane as their second choice,

819
00:48:47.580 --> 00:48:50.970
then all of those votes would go to her and vice versa.

820
00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:55.980
That way they actually have a better chance of beating the front runner

821
00:48:56.060 --> 00:48:58.700
<v 12>London breed. And that made a lot of sense.</v>

822
00:48:58.701 --> 00:49:02.180
They were both quote unquote more progressive candidates and you know,

823
00:49:02.210 --> 00:49:03.830
saw each other. Uh,

824
00:49:03.860 --> 00:49:08.510
at least the rhetoric goes as the person that they'd like to see as mayor if not

825
00:49:08.511 --> 00:49:12.440
themselves. Was that, was that a surprise move to you as you recovering it?

826
00:49:12.441 --> 00:49:14.950
Did you see that common? I didn't see it coming. No, I,

827
00:49:14.951 --> 00:49:17.480
I think that was a surprise to a lot of people.

828
00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:22.280
<v 11>I almost had to do a double take when I saw these new campaign posters</v>

829
00:49:22.460 --> 00:49:27.230
supporting both Jane Kim and Mark Leno for mayor. After that press conference,

830
00:49:27.270 --> 00:49:31.050
<v 12>Mark Leno and Jane Kim started appearing in campaign ads together.</v>

831
00:49:31.280 --> 00:49:35.690
<v 11>I'm Jane Kim and I'm Mark Leno campaigning for one another.</v>

832
00:49:36.020 --> 00:49:40.370
Mark and I are opponents, but Jane and I agree you should pick our next mayor,

833
00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:44.270
not the billionaires. So basically the whole campaign is like,

834
00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:47.390
if you don't vote for me first, then at least vote for me. Second,

835
00:49:47.510 --> 00:49:48.590
let's stand together.

836
00:49:49.190 --> 00:49:52.850
Vote for me and Mark Leno vote for me and Jane Kim.

837
00:49:55.540 --> 00:49:59.000
Alright. KPIX five Joe Vasquez is with the London breed campaign.

838
00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:03.950
We're just moments ago braid address the crowd, Joe. So on election night,

839
00:50:04.750 --> 00:50:07.910
uh, London breed has a pretty commanding lead, uh,

840
00:50:07.940 --> 00:50:12.380
as the polls are coming to a close and basically she's trying to get up to this

841
00:50:12.381 --> 00:50:17.000
marker of 50% of the votes plus one vote. That's a majority.

842
00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:21.410
Um, and if she can get to that, then she wins.

843
00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:26.360
There's no rank choice runoff. There's no vote swapping. Um,

844
00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:28.420
and as the night goes on,

845
00:50:28.470 --> 00:50:32.790
<v 14>she has not yet declaring victory, but this crowd is celebrating.</v>

846
00:50:33.050 --> 00:50:36.140
<v 11>She's got like a double digit leap. Like things are looking pretty good.</v>

847
00:50:36.170 --> 00:50:40.400
<v 14>They are celebrating the person they believe could be the next mayor of San</v>

848
00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:41.233
Francisco.

849
00:50:41.660 --> 00:50:42.341
<v 12>Holy smokes,</v>

850
00:50:42.341 --> 00:50:46.640
she's beating Mark Leno by 10 percentage points and she's beating Jane Kim by

851
00:50:46.641 --> 00:50:48.590
more than that. So we're getting to midnight.

852
00:50:48.591 --> 00:50:51.050
I'm completely bleary-eyed staring at my laptop,

853
00:50:51.060 --> 00:50:55.770
refreshing the department of elections website every few seconds when 1230 at

854
00:50:55.771 --> 00:50:56.604
night,

855
00:50:58.210 --> 00:51:02.590
<v 11>it happens in the early returns. London breed had a sizable lead,</v>

856
00:51:02.740 --> 00:51:07.480
but she didn't reach 50%. She came in just shy of 50%.

857
00:51:07.510 --> 00:51:12.510
So the ranked choice voting system kicked in and all of a sudden this entire

858
00:51:13.210 --> 00:51:16.990
racist changed. Okay. So the rankings had been London breed number one,

859
00:51:17.380 --> 00:51:19.240
mark linen, number two, Jane Kim,

860
00:51:19.241 --> 00:51:23.890
who was in third place with now eliminated in that rank choice system.

861
00:51:23.950 --> 00:51:26.890
But when Kim got eliminated, a huge chunk of her voters,

862
00:51:26.920 --> 00:51:30.940
about three out of four went to Leno because Leno was their second choice.

863
00:51:30.970 --> 00:51:33.640
And now by a raise or a thin margin,

864
00:51:33.670 --> 00:51:38.670
Mark Leno is leading the way the Kim Leno strategy had come to fruition.

865
00:51:38.770 --> 00:51:42.820
He's up 0.84% limits of leads.

866
00:51:42.850 --> 00:51:45.520
The mayor's race is still too close to call.

867
00:51:45.670 --> 00:51:49.360
The race would actually drag on for days as more ballots got counted,

868
00:51:49.390 --> 00:51:52.150
tens of thousands of outstanding ballots.

869
00:51:52.330 --> 00:51:56.810
We didn't have a mayor chosen until I think eight days later when [inaudible]

870
00:51:59.570 --> 00:51:59.720
<v 1>[inaudible]</v>

871
00:51:59.720 --> 00:52:04.720
<v 11>in a gymnasium packed with screaming supporters outworked the new mayor of San</v>

872
00:52:05.970 --> 00:52:09.140
Francisco. London. Greed. Yes. Omneo mayor

873
00:52:11.090 --> 00:52:11.923
<v 1>[inaudible],</v>

874
00:52:12.020 --> 00:52:15.810
<v 11>Mark Leno came up just short. He came within one day</v>

875
00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:20.830
<v 12>0.1% or a little over 2,500 votes. Oh Man. Um,</v>

876
00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:24.180
so I mean a, okay, it didn't work in that he didn't win,

877
00:52:24.181 --> 00:52:26.460
but you can't say that it was completely ineffective.

878
00:52:26.750 --> 00:52:28.790
<v 11>And so, so ultimately what,</v>

879
00:52:28.791 --> 00:52:32.510
what did people think of this whole like Mark Leno,

880
00:52:32.511 --> 00:52:33.860
Jane Kim Coming Together?

881
00:52:34.120 --> 00:52:38.890
<v 12>The people saw the dual endorsement strategy as well as gaming the system as</v>

882
00:52:38.891 --> 00:52:39.724
saying, look,

883
00:52:39.940 --> 00:52:44.020
they are doing this in order to keep London breed from winning.

884
00:52:44.080 --> 00:52:46.470
<v 11>And that was that was that your paper, right? That was that. Yeah.</v>

885
00:52:46.850 --> 00:52:50.130
<v 12>Yeah. Our editorial board, uh, said set as much, you know, and I,</v>

886
00:52:50.131 --> 00:52:53.150
and I think that that's not just the ED board. I mean people do feel that way,

887
00:52:53.151 --> 00:52:56.720
that it was this strategy, you know, especially London breed supporters who saw,

888
00:52:56.930 --> 00:53:01.400
who saw a teaming up a piling on and you know, in this, I mean, just to kind of,

889
00:53:01.490 --> 00:53:03.500
just very quickly, just to zoom out all the way,

890
00:53:03.501 --> 00:53:08.501
I think people just find that weird in a country in which politics ends up being

891
00:53:09.390 --> 00:53:13.040
as zero sum game oftentimes in which you are, you know,

892
00:53:13.041 --> 00:53:17.480
relentlessly attacking your opponent, beating them born. Yeah, exactly.

893
00:53:17.510 --> 00:53:22.460
Exactly. But at the same time, that's very much,

894
00:53:23.170 --> 00:53:25.980
um, you know, there might be some people at my own newspaper disagree with me,

895
00:53:25.981 --> 00:53:30.981
but I think that's very much in the spirit of what rank choice voting invites,

896
00:53:31.860 --> 00:53:34.610
coalition building. Now,

897
00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:38.420
Dominic wanted to be clear that in the case of the mayor's race,

898
00:53:38.720 --> 00:53:40.760
this coming together of opponents,

899
00:53:40.790 --> 00:53:43.580
I don't want to make it sound like it was just some kind of Koombaya thing,

900
00:53:43.581 --> 00:53:45.380
you know, because that really, that wasn't the case.

901
00:53:46.060 --> 00:53:50.890
<v 11>But at the very next stop on our tour, we actually found that case,</v>

902
00:53:54.550 --> 00:53:56.770
the Kumbaya case. Hey Curtis, are you there?

903
00:53:57.670 --> 00:54:02.590
Which also on the line we have let this, hi, how are you doing? Hey, what's up?

904
00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:05.530
We heard about from this Guy Curtis Gilbert,

905
00:54:05.590 --> 00:54:08.800
and I'm a reporter at American public media,

906
00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.500
but I used to be a reporter at Minnesota public radio.

907
00:54:12.270 --> 00:54:15.000
So Curtis told us in Minneapolis,

908
00:54:15.030 --> 00:54:18.420
they actually started using rank choice voting in 2009

909
00:54:18.530 --> 00:54:22.940
<v 15>but it's gotten much more interesting since then. So in um,</v>

910
00:54:23.270 --> 00:54:28.100
2013 was the first time Minneapolis actually had like a competitive mayor's

911
00:54:28.101 --> 00:54:30.590
race. Uh, under rank choice voting

912
00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:33.970
<v 11>rules are record breaking number of candidates vying to succeed.</v>

913
00:54:33.971 --> 00:54:37.360
Minneapolis mayor r t ride back who's stepping down at the end of this year,

914
00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:42.010
35 candidates signed up to run to replace him. Oh Wow.

915
00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:46.620
Yeah. Curtis Gilbert covers Minneapolis politics. He joins me in studio. Wait,

916
00:54:46.621 --> 00:54:50.530
you're going to be busy shot. You betcha. I mean, there were so many, I mean,

917
00:54:50.531 --> 00:54:53.770
35 candidates is a lot. Unlike the race in San Francisco,

918
00:54:53.771 --> 00:54:56.980
the mayoral race in Minneapolis, people say, aren't you?

919
00:54:56.981 --> 00:55:00.790
The Republican did have more diverse candidates. And I say, sure.

920
00:55:00.791 --> 00:55:05.020
I've done some work in the Republican Party and I also stand fiercely for

921
00:55:05.021 --> 00:55:09.550
marriage equality. Always have, there was a republican and independent,

922
00:55:09.551 --> 00:55:10.480
a bunch of Democrats.

923
00:55:10.550 --> 00:55:14.330
<v 15>It was a wide open, free for all race. And it was really,</v>

924
00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:15.770
it was really interesting

925
00:55:15.850 --> 00:55:17.290
<v 11>that despite all that,</v>

926
00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:21.380
<v 15>they were very, very civil.</v>

927
00:55:21.830 --> 00:55:25.070
Thank you very much. It's nice to see you're not utterly infallible.

928
00:55:25.100 --> 00:55:29.540
I always saw very, very gentle to each other.

929
00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:33.910
Won't be rude with each other. It doesn't benefit us to be rude with each other.

930
00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:37.930
And this is one thing that the advocates of rank choice voting, um,

931
00:55:38.030 --> 00:55:40.280
sort of look at as a positive. You know, voters don't,

932
00:55:40.310 --> 00:55:45.310
voters are turned off by negative campaign and there's a theory that goes that

933
00:55:45.470 --> 00:55:48.110
if you're hoping to get like second and third choice votes,

934
00:55:48.290 --> 00:55:51.890
you'll be much nicer to your opponents so you don't alienate their supporters

935
00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:53.690
and maybe you get a second or third choice vote.

936
00:55:54.140 --> 00:55:58.610
And it did seem like there was an element of that playing out,

937
00:55:59.310 --> 00:56:00.980
um, in, in the race. Uh,

938
00:56:01.010 --> 00:56:04.700
I will talk more about the issues because I think I've run out of time.

939
00:56:05.060 --> 00:56:08.540
Thank you. So at worst there was like some light ribbing.

940
00:56:08.570 --> 00:56:10.940
They said we could finish our sentences if we've run out of time,

941
00:56:10.941 --> 00:56:12.440
but I think that was a run on sentence,

942
00:56:14.140 --> 00:56:18.280
<v 11>polite stage logistics. Getting out of that chair is a little challenging.</v>

943
00:56:18.281 --> 00:56:21.820
So we may want to pass the microphone around and

944
00:56:21.970 --> 00:56:26.960
<v 15>thank you. Thank you, Jackie. Plenty of thank you. Yeah, I mean the,</v>

945
00:56:26.980 --> 00:56:27.760
the most remark,

946
00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:30.490
<v 3>well one of all was the final debate.</v>

947
00:56:30.790 --> 00:56:32.490
<v 1>Oh God. [inaudible]</v>

948
00:56:33.630 --> 00:56:37.020
<v 15>I was there and it was in a church, I think it was in downtown Minneapolis.</v>

949
00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:39.210
The camera with the church was, um,

950
00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:43.440
and at the end of the debate, the candidates,

951
00:56:43.441 --> 00:56:44.700
and I think there were eight of them

952
00:56:45.100 --> 00:56:49.450
<v 3>all kind of put their arms around each other and one of them suggested that they</v>

953
00:56:49.451 --> 00:56:50.284
all sing

954
00:56:55.000 --> 00:56:56.730
<v 1>[inaudible] yeah. Bye y'all.</v>

955
00:57:02.640 --> 00:57:07.260
[inaudible] after the debate, after the debate.

956
00:57:08.580 --> 00:57:10.190
Oh no,

957
00:57:13.620 --> 00:57:17.570
that's fine. Great. Great.

958
00:57:30.310 --> 00:57:33.670
<v 3>So it's like, I mean it's almost like a cartoon, right? Like the, the Kumbaya.</v>

959
00:57:33.671 --> 00:57:38.260
It's really funny, right? But it's also, it's, it's also,

960
00:57:38.440 --> 00:57:41.920
I think for a lot of people right now that feels like a relief.

961
00:57:41.950 --> 00:57:46.030
It feels like a relief to hear politicians not biting each other's heads off.

962
00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.480
And that's, that's something that comes from rank choice voting.

963
00:57:49.481 --> 00:57:52.480
You find consensus, you find coalition,

964
00:57:52.481 --> 00:57:55.360
you find commonalities instead of differences.

965
00:57:56.770 --> 00:58:00.210
But that also flattens everyone out. If,

966
00:58:00.211 --> 00:58:04.680
if everyone ends up running to the middle and then you just have kind of a,

967
00:58:05.050 --> 00:58:05.480
a,

968
00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:10.480
a bland consensus where no one's seeing bold things and everybody is just kind

969
00:58:11.991 --> 00:58:15.860
of middle. So in a way, when you make this choice,

970
00:58:15.861 --> 00:58:20.420
you're choosing for do this carefully.

971
00:58:21.290 --> 00:58:25.130
Write carefully that I wondered about that because I was thinking maybe don't do

972
00:58:25.131 --> 00:58:27.990
this carefully. Maybe have a country that can be dynamic,

973
00:58:28.300 --> 00:58:31.320
although right now I'm not so sure. So two dynamic. Yeah,

974
00:58:32.060 --> 00:58:36.300
but that is in deep in a deep way. That's what's being asked here.

975
00:58:36.680 --> 00:58:39.140
Like what do we, what do we actually want?

976
00:58:39.170 --> 00:58:42.530
Like do we want a system where you know,

977
00:58:42.531 --> 00:58:45.710
you are lined up behind your alpha dog, who's gonna,

978
00:58:45.920 --> 00:58:49.310
who's gonna argue for all of the things you want and, and,

979
00:58:49.460 --> 00:58:53.390
and maybe you're gonna get him, but maybe you're also gonna lose them all or,

980
00:58:53.750 --> 00:58:57.680
or do you want it, you know, be in a system where, you know, you're,

981
00:58:57.980 --> 00:59:02.980
we're all kind of sort of be grudgingly bought into our second place person who

982
00:59:04.761 --> 00:59:08.810
we can kind of get behind. But like, it definitely wasn't our, you know,

983
00:59:08.811 --> 00:59:09.680
it's not our ideal.

984
00:59:09.710 --> 00:59:13.100
And I think that's a question that's like a soul searching kind of a question.

985
00:59:13.101 --> 00:59:15.910
Like what do you want and what do we want this country to be? Right.

986
00:59:15.950 --> 00:59:19.640
And for that reason I like, I don't know how I feel about it.

987
00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.100
It's going to be perfect. I think what's really

988
00:59:22.100 --> 00:59:26.210
<v 5>interesting is what seems sort of mechanical and um,</v>

989
00:59:27.080 --> 00:59:27.913
technical.

990
00:59:28.550 --> 00:59:32.480
It does affect the tone of your country and of history.

991
00:59:32.481 --> 00:59:35.060
So the world we've got is the function of how we vote.

992
00:59:35.061 --> 00:59:38.660
Now change the system of Foley vote. You might get a very different world.

993
00:59:38.900 --> 00:59:42.440
How different, what different. We're different, which kind of different, scary,

994
00:59:42.441 --> 00:59:44.210
different, good, different, you don't know.

995
00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:44.821
<v 11>Well,</v>

996
00:59:44.821 --> 00:59:49.821
we might actually know soon because I actually have one more stop on our cross

997
00:59:51.211 --> 00:59:53.280
country ranked choice voting tour

998
00:59:54.810 --> 00:59:58.460
steed may the great state of Maine leave.

999
00:59:58.970 --> 01:00:02.880
We sing super politically diverse, fiercely independent,

1000
01:00:02.881 --> 01:00:05.070
like a lot of independent voters.

1001
01:00:07.670 --> 01:00:09.450
[inaudible] and in fact,

1002
01:00:09.451 --> 01:00:14.451
in in 2016 there was this coalition of Independence and Democrats that managed

1003
01:00:15.301 --> 01:00:20.301
to get this ballot initiative that would change all statewide elections to rank

1004
01:00:20.671 --> 01:00:23.040
choice voting statewide. Yeah.

1005
01:00:23.370 --> 01:00:28.370
And right choice voting was adopted in 2016 according to Maine public radio

1006
01:00:28.831 --> 01:00:31.170
reporter Steve Misler, it passed,

1007
01:00:31.250 --> 01:00:33.830
<v 5>it passed. However, with a major flaw,</v>

1008
01:00:34.110 --> 01:00:38.850
<v 16>it's a scam. It undermines the integrity of our election process.</v>

1009
01:00:40.090 --> 01:00:44.560
<v 5>The state Senate, which was under Republican control at the time,</v>

1010
01:00:45.130 --> 01:00:50.130
picked up on this constitutional conflict within a conflict within the state

1011
01:00:50.441 --> 01:00:52.680
constitution. We're not happy

1012
01:00:53.630 --> 01:00:55.560
<v 16>blatantly opposed to it very unconstitutional.</v>

1013
01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.490
<v 11>The Maine Constitution literally says you have to use a plurality vote.</v>

1014
01:00:59.560 --> 01:01:04.000
<v 5>The word plurality is actually written in the constitution as opposed to a</v>

1015
01:01:04.001 --> 01:01:05.350
majority. Correct,

1016
01:01:05.410 --> 01:01:10.410
and ultimately the main legislature passed a law that delayed implementing rank

1017
01:01:11.861 --> 01:01:12.694
choice voting. Right.

1018
01:01:13.140 --> 01:01:18.140
<v 11>Lacy is one more example of where the politicians are extended against the will</v>

1019
01:01:21.381 --> 01:01:25.730
of the people and it set off this whole fight where where people rallied against

1020
01:01:25.731 --> 01:01:29.240
the state legislature and held another vote in June.

1021
01:01:29.300 --> 01:01:30.980
Literally this past June,

1022
01:01:31.150 --> 01:01:34.090
people gathered at the State House this morning to get around the delay

1023
01:01:34.380 --> 01:01:37.430
[inaudible] through what was built as a people's veto that passed

1024
01:01:37.730 --> 01:01:39.450
<v 5>20 almost the exact same margin,</v>

1025
01:01:39.510 --> 01:01:42.960
if not slightly more than when it passed originally in 26 [inaudible].

1026
01:01:43.590 --> 01:01:46.440
<v 11>At some point, the Maine Supreme Court gets involved.</v>

1027
01:01:46.890 --> 01:01:50.010
And really the details of this are all kind of a mess.

1028
01:01:50.011 --> 01:01:54.840
But what it boils down to is this, in the upcoming elections,

1029
01:01:54.841 --> 01:01:56.670
like the midterms that are happening now,

1030
01:01:57.870 --> 01:02:02.640
Maine will use ranked choice voting for it's congressional races.

1031
01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:07.430
<v 5>We have three of them this year. We have a first congressional district race,</v>

1032
01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:09.080
it'll be used in that contest.

1033
01:02:09.220 --> 01:02:13.570
<v 11>And also in Maine Second Congressional district, which is a swing seat, one of,</v>

1034
01:02:13.630 --> 01:02:15.820
you know, a dozen or so nationally,

1035
01:02:15.870 --> 01:02:20.010
a k one of the districts that everybody's going to be watching in the midterms.

1036
01:02:20.490 --> 01:02:24.690
And on top of that, they're going to use rank choice voting for the Senate,

1037
01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:29.310
the US Senate campaign. It will be used in that contest. Do you know,

1038
01:02:29.311 --> 01:02:31.890
is this the first time it's going to be used, uh,

1039
01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:35.910
for a position in the federal government? Yeah, no other state has ever done it.

1040
01:02:36.090 --> 01:02:40.200
Oh Wow. But at the same time, because of their state constitution,

1041
01:02:40.230 --> 01:02:42.960
it's not being used in the gubernatorial race.

1042
01:02:43.200 --> 01:02:45.750
So does the ballot just like look insane?

1043
01:02:45.751 --> 01:02:49.350
Like part of it is like this rank choice voting thing and,

1044
01:02:49.770 --> 01:02:52.890
and part of it is, isn't like they're just separate.

1045
01:02:52.950 --> 01:02:55.770
So they're separate valves for the federal races.

1046
01:02:55.800 --> 01:02:58.530
And then there's a separate one for the statewide one. So the,

1047
01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:01.770
I haven't actually seen how many ballots that voters are handed.

1048
01:03:01.771 --> 01:03:05.760
So this is really going to happen now. Like, like this week? Yeah. Oh yeah.

1049
01:03:05.820 --> 01:03:09.390
Two main claims of rank choice voting are being put to the test

1050
01:03:11.580 --> 01:03:14.970
<v 14>in the very first, in his very first rollout in Maine,</v>

1051
01:03:15.390 --> 01:03:18.000
voters in Maine will head to the polls later this month,

1052
01:03:18.030 --> 01:03:23.030
whether it can work for a third party or independent candidates choice.

1053
01:03:23.970 --> 01:03:28.800
But it's also a test case about whether or not it does what it promises.

1054
01:03:28.890 --> 01:03:31.910
He just told another big fib right in front of everybody in me.

1055
01:03:32.070 --> 01:03:36.600
You're lying about my Roger's re reduce scorched earth campaigns.

1056
01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:39.660
I don't know where you getting this Tiffany box. The general

1057
01:03:45.130 --> 01:03:48.910
<v 1>[inaudible] may go low. He kicked [inaudible] to the Santa's slide.</v>

1058
01:03:50.190 --> 01:03:51.600
<v 14>2129 voted as much as you</v>

1059
01:03:55.930 --> 01:03:56.763
[inaudible] they've gone

1060
01:04:02.220 --> 01:04:03.053
[inaudible] house in the center.

1061
01:04:15.530 --> 01:04:18.080
But also,

1062
01:04:18.590 --> 01:04:19.240
<v 11>I guess I'd,</v>

1063
01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:24.240
I just wonder if the people of Maine are going to come out of this election

1064
01:04:26.690 --> 01:04:30.080
feeling a little bit more like,

1065
01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:33.260
like democracy is working for them.

1066
01:04:46.650 --> 01:04:50.910
<v 1>Wouldn't it be interesting if in Maine somebody who was, you know,</v>

1067
01:04:50.940 --> 01:04:54.720
everybody's eighth choice gets elected to Congress.

1068
01:04:57.020 --> 01:05:00.010
I bet. We'll see. Yeah.

1069
01:05:06.740 --> 01:05:08.930
