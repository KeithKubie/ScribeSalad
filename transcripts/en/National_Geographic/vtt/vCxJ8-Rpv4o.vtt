00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:10.743
The Geographic was never
far from my mind.

00:00:10.743 --> 00:00:13.913
<i>This is the first picture I ever
 had published in the magazine</i>

00:00:13.913 --> 00:00:17.049
<i> from a story about La Salle,
 the French explorer.</i>

00:00:17.049 --> 00:00:19.485
<i> We worked on Patagonian
 dinosaur hunters.</i>

00:00:19.485 --> 00:00:22.454
<i> These are dinosaur
 footprints in Patagonia.</i>

00:00:22.454 --> 00:00:24.423
<i> And then the third story I did</i>

00:00:24.423 --> 00:00:27.427
<i> was more what you'd think as
 a</i>National Geographic<i>story.</i>

00:00:27.427 --> 00:00:31.130
<i> I skied around the
Yukon Territory with scientists</i>

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:32.464
<i> and we were studying nunataks</i>

00:00:32.464 --> 00:00:35.568
which are the rocky regions
that pop through the glaciers.

00:00:35.568 --> 00:00:38.571
And we were doing a survey
of the animal life on that.

00:00:39.305 --> 00:00:41.607
<i> The assignments started
 to come more frequently.</i>

00:00:41.607 --> 00:00:43.276
<i>One year I did six assignments.</i>

00:00:43.276 --> 00:00:46.946
<i> This is from a story
 in Ashkelon in Israel.</i>

00:00:46.946 --> 00:00:50.015
<i> This is a story from the
 Battle of Trafalgar.</i>

00:00:50.015 --> 00:00:51.750
<i> And... these are sea scouts</i>

00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:55.254
<i> that are looking at a painting
 on the wall behind me.</i>

00:00:55.254 --> 00:00:58.257
<i>This is the first digital photo
 I ever had in the magazine.</i>

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:02.495
I worked on an impossible story
to do. It was called...

00:01:02.495 --> 00:01:03.629
you know, "How Old Is It".

00:01:03.629 --> 00:01:06.199
It was about how scientists
date and age the universe.

00:01:06.199 --> 00:01:08.434
And I had a mathematician
we talked to

00:01:08.434 --> 00:01:11.704
and he calculated that a
three-day old baby is

00:01:11.704 --> 00:01:14.040
one-one hundred trillionth
the age of the universe.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:17.677
So, my brother-in-law
is a OB-GYN in New York

00:01:17.677 --> 00:01:20.547
he hooked me up with somebody
who just had a baby.

00:01:20.547 --> 00:01:23.649
<i> I shot it on the third
 day, flew to California,</i>

00:01:23.649 --> 00:01:26.286
<i> we were out in the desert and
 we're just trying to think</i>

00:01:26.286 --> 00:01:27.787
<i> of something that
 was illustrated</i>

00:01:27.787 --> 00:01:30.590
<i> that would make people
 stop and pay attention.</i>

00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:33.693
I think my job quite often
is the opposite of a writer.

00:01:33.693 --> 00:01:37.597
You know, it's... they want you
tearing through their words and

00:01:37.597 --> 00:01:39.532
I want people to stop.

00:01:39.532 --> 00:01:42.068
I always want people to
stop and just consider

00:01:42.068 --> 00:01:43.670
and pay attention to things.

00:01:44.504 --> 00:01:45.804
<i> This is from
 the Xinjiang Dynasty.</i>

00:01:45.804 --> 00:01:47.874
<i> These boys had
 collected river stones</i>

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:50.409
<i> and were going off
 to build a wall.</i>

00:01:50.409 --> 00:01:51.978
<i> I remember this
 picture well because</i>

00:01:51.978 --> 00:01:53.246
<i> there's a building
 in the back and</i>

00:01:53.246 --> 00:01:55.481
<i> I was standing at that
 gas station in the back</i>

00:01:55.481 --> 00:01:57.183
<i> and I saw them drive
 by and it's like,</i>

00:01:57.183 --> 00:01:58.984
<i> "Oh, my gosh, that's
 such a good picture."</i>

00:01:58.984 --> 00:02:01.487
<i> So, I took off running
 down the road.</i>

00:02:01.487 --> 00:02:04.724
My driver was in the restroom,
so I ran down the road

00:02:04.724 --> 00:02:06.993
and jumped on, after
a quarter mile or so

00:02:06.993 --> 00:02:09.729
I jumped on the back
of this tractor.

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.731
And the guy driving the
tractor didn't realize

00:02:11.731 --> 00:02:13.633
the kids didn't realize.
( audience laughter )

00:02:13.633 --> 00:02:15.702
And I'm sitting there
and I get the camera up

00:02:15.702 --> 00:02:16.736
and I'm shooting pictures.

00:02:16.870 --> 00:02:18.804
I'm like, "this is great,
the light's really pretty."

00:02:18.804 --> 00:02:21.540
And I had four frames
on my camera.

00:02:21.540 --> 00:02:22.975
So I was like, "Argh!"

00:02:22.975 --> 00:02:23.976
This was when I'm shooting film.

00:02:23.976 --> 00:02:26.913
So I just slowed
down and made...

00:02:26.913 --> 00:02:29.282
I made four pretty
good frames and

00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.351
it was one of those
situations that

00:02:32.351 --> 00:02:34.921
I'm happy and lucky
that I had this image.

00:02:36.922 --> 00:02:38.924
<i> Worked on a story
 about Doggerland.</i>

00:02:38.924 --> 00:02:41.360
<i> A land bridge,
 during one of the Ice Ages</i>

00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:43.763
<i> between the continent
 and England.</i>

00:02:43.763 --> 00:02:46.031
Where the tide--
when this goes out

00:02:46.031 --> 00:02:48.401
they can find footprints
and artifacts.

00:02:48.401 --> 00:02:51.304
Some of these places are
finding amazing burials.

00:02:51.771 --> 00:02:54.540
<i> When things get covered
 up by silt and water</i>

00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:55.841
<i> and things like that
 that's actually--</i>

00:02:55.841 --> 00:02:57.743
<i> people would think that's
 what destroys things</i>

00:02:57.743 --> 00:03:00.846
<i> but that keeps the microbes
 that are in the air away</i>

00:03:00.846 --> 00:03:02.882
<i> and things are more
 well preserved.</i>

00:03:03.382 --> 00:03:06.285
I worked on a story
on a tomb in Peru

00:03:06.285 --> 00:03:08.120
called "Wari Tomb".

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.056
<i> We set there and you
 know they said,</i>

00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:11.223
<i> "hey there might
 be something here,"</i>

00:03:11.223 --> 00:03:13.592
<i> and they completely
 uncovered it in front of us</i>

00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.328
<i> and it was clutching
 that fabric.</i>

00:03:16.328 --> 00:03:17.530
<i> It was an amazing thing to see</i>

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.899
<i> there's small tattoos
 on the wrist and</i>

00:03:19.899 --> 00:03:22.568
<i> this fits into a larger body
 of work that I'm doing.</i>

00:03:22.568 --> 00:03:25.505
I photographed about
60 or 70 mummies.

00:03:26.673 --> 00:03:29.508
<i> 3D printing.
 3D printed gun.</i>

00:03:29.508 --> 00:03:31.144
<i> You know we were technically
 trying to figure out</i>

00:03:31.144 --> 00:03:33.479
<i> how to capture a bullet.</i>

00:03:33.479 --> 00:03:36.849
<i> And it's really complicated
 because the strobes have to be</i>

00:03:36.849 --> 00:03:39.117
<i> photographed at about one
 one</i>-<i>millionth of a second</i>

00:03:39.117 --> 00:03:40.853
to capture a bullet coming out.

00:03:40.853 --> 00:03:43.556
And, you know, there's no strobe
conventionally that can do that.

00:03:43.556 --> 00:03:46.826
You'd have to go to MIT,
to the laboratory where

00:03:46.826 --> 00:03:49.161
'Doc' Edgerton
invented the strobe.

00:03:49.428 --> 00:03:51.864
So we were going to
do the best we could

00:03:51.864 --> 00:03:55.368
and had these other strobes
and he fired the gun

00:03:55.368 --> 00:03:59.238
this guy who 3D printed
this gun and it exploded.

00:03:59.238 --> 00:04:03.042
So, the bullet was slowed down
because the barrel exploded.

00:04:03.042 --> 00:04:06.045
So, this was the first picture
I shot on that assignment.

00:04:06.045 --> 00:04:08.047
It was like, looking
at it on digital,

00:04:08.047 --> 00:04:09.949
"well, that works
out pretty well."

00:04:09.949 --> 00:04:11.483
( audience laughter )

00:04:11.483 --> 00:04:12.618
That, uhh... happy with that.

00:04:12.618 --> 00:04:15.321
I don't want to get near an
exploding gun anyway, so.

00:04:16.255 --> 00:04:18.758
<i> And this was the most
 fun, doing this one.</i>

00:04:18.758 --> 00:04:21.360
<i> This is a scanning
 electronic microscope picture</i>

00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:23.563
<i> that I shot of shark skin,
 and you can see</i>

00:04:23.563 --> 00:04:27.734
the shape of shark skin and they
built a swimsuit based on that

00:04:27.734 --> 00:04:29.868
and it was...

00:04:29.868 --> 00:04:33.072
the fastest times in the world
was set using that suit.

00:04:33.072 --> 00:04:35.341
Ultimately that suit
was outlawed because

00:04:35.341 --> 00:04:37.476
they would throw it in the
water and it would just float

00:04:37.476 --> 00:04:40.046
and you can't, you know,
wear a floatation device

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:41.881
they decided--
In the mean time

00:04:41.881 --> 00:04:43.850
I had an assistant, who
was a college swimmer

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:45.083
and he was like,
"we should get the

00:04:45.083 --> 00:04:47.386
fastest swimmer in the
world to wear this."

00:04:47.386 --> 00:04:48.187
I'm like, "Yeah."

00:04:48.487 --> 00:04:51.290
So, he goes, "Oh, it's
Gary Hall, he's in Florida.

00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:52.758
I know where he swims."

00:04:52.758 --> 00:04:54.660
So, he called and
within half an hour

00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.295
Gary Hall had said yes.

00:04:56.795 --> 00:04:58.130
<i> So, I was like, "Really?"</i>

00:04:58.130 --> 00:05:00.699
<i> So, then it was time to
 figure out how to do it.</i>

00:05:00.699 --> 00:05:03.936
<i> So we did a lot of testing,
 we got there and tested.</i>

00:05:03.936 --> 00:05:08.273
<i> Before... we were being
 delayed through thunderstorms</i>

00:05:08.273 --> 00:05:10.409
<i> and before Gary
 got in the water</i>

00:05:10.409 --> 00:05:12.878
<i> we were doing
 some testing.</i>

00:05:12.878 --> 00:05:16.882
<i> And this is me...
 ( audience laughter )</i>

00:05:16.882 --> 00:05:20.619
<i> swimming. I showed Gary the
picture and I was trying to get</i>

00:05:20.619 --> 00:05:22.055
You know, 'cause
in my mind's eye

00:05:22.055 --> 00:05:23.489
it was like that,
it was like--

00:05:23.489 --> 00:05:25.758
( audience laughter )
you know, really svelte.

00:05:25.758 --> 00:05:26.792
I said, "What do you think?"

00:05:26.893 --> 00:05:29.094
And he said, "I think you
should keep your hips up."

00:05:29.094 --> 00:05:31.230
( audience laughter )

00:05:31.898 --> 00:05:36.102
<i> This is a chart of the
 Pythagorean Theorem of Light.</i>

00:05:36.102 --> 00:05:39.004
<i> I have no idea what it says.
 Or what it means.</i>

00:05:39.472 --> 00:05:42.174
But I had the opportunity
to work for a photographer

00:05:42.174 --> 00:05:43.542
who did know what it meant.

00:05:43.542 --> 00:05:45.745
And I learned more in
about a month from him

00:05:45.745 --> 00:05:48.247
than I had learned in the
entirety of my career.

00:05:48.247 --> 00:05:51.617
<i> This is a picture I did for
 a story about bog bodies</i>

00:05:51.617 --> 00:05:55.154
<i>and this is every picture I shot
 of this on this assignment.</i>

00:05:56.255 --> 00:05:58.824
<i> I think I made
 87 lighting changes</i>

00:05:58.824 --> 00:06:00.726
<i> and there's 87 pictures.</i>

00:06:00.726 --> 00:06:02.595
<i> And then that's the one
 we ended up publishing.</i>

00:06:02.595 --> 00:06:06.765
Generally, in my work, I
kind of stop when I'm happy.

00:06:06.765 --> 00:06:09.869
You know, lighting a situation,
so I kind of stop when

00:06:09.869 --> 00:06:13.439
I think it's gonna look as
good as it's gonna look, so.

00:06:13.439 --> 00:06:15.874
<i> These were hard mummies
 to photograph because</i>

00:06:15.874 --> 00:06:18.243
<i> they are, basically,
 shiny and black</i>

00:06:18.243 --> 00:06:20.846
<i> so, you had different choices
 on how you're gonna do it.</i>

00:06:20.846 --> 00:06:22.647
<i> This is one of the mummies.</i>

00:06:22.647 --> 00:06:24.850
<i> It's called the river of tar.</i>

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:26.452
<i> And that's the
 location where some</i>

00:06:26.452 --> 00:06:28.955
<i> of the bog bodies
 were found.</i>

00:06:29.322 --> 00:06:31.890
<i> In the bogs they are finding
 all sorts of things.</i>

00:06:31.890 --> 00:06:35.928
<i> They are finding, you know,
shoes, and that's a peat shovel.</i>

00:06:35.928 --> 00:06:39.564
<i> A peat bog shovel from
 about 2,500 years ago.</i>

00:06:40.232 --> 00:06:42.000
<i> Each of these has an
 individual story.</i>

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.004
<i> This is a 14-year old female</i>

00:06:45.004 --> 00:06:48.140
<i> that they don't know why
 she was in the bogs.</i>

00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:50.843
<i> And this is the most famous,
 this is the Tollund man</i>

00:06:50.843 --> 00:06:53.512
<i> who had the leather
 noose around his neck</i>

00:06:53.512 --> 00:06:55.581
<i> and had a leather hat.</i>

00:06:55.581 --> 00:06:58.183
You know everybody talks
about his peaceful gaze

00:06:58.183 --> 00:07:00.653
and the tannin,
the soil that he is in

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:04.056
is the thing that has made
their bodies so dark.

00:07:04.056 --> 00:07:06.325
It's like tanning a saddle.

00:07:06.325 --> 00:07:07.660
They absorb the
chemistry and

00:07:07.660 --> 00:07:09.629
it's also what makes
their hair red.
