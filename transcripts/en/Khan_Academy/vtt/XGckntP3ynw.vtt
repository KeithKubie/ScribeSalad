00:00:01.801 --> 00:00:02.279
Voiceover: Few people realize,

00:00:02.279 --> 00:00:05.216
that before I made even the
first video for Khan Academy,

00:00:05.216 --> 00:00:08.917
the whole point of Khan Academy
was to be a exercise, practice,

00:00:08.917 --> 00:00:13.418
feedback, reporting engine for
students, for parents and for teachers.

00:00:13.418 --> 00:00:16.135
The first videos were really
just a way to compliment that.

00:00:16.873 --> 00:00:19.602
Even if we go back as far back as 2005,

00:00:19.602 --> 00:00:21.200
we had a lot of exercises on Khan Academy,

00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:23.855
and we got our first real funding in 2010.

00:00:23.855 --> 00:00:27.053
That's where we invested most heavily.

00:00:27.053 --> 00:00:28.943
Now that the Common Core has come out,

00:00:28.943 --> 00:00:31.278
and not only has it come out, not only
have the standards been published,

00:00:31.278 --> 00:00:34.755
but now that there's a
sense of the adoptions,

00:00:34.755 --> 00:00:37.520
there's a sense of how it
is going to be assessed.

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.349
We've decided to do a serious
push to intentionally make sure,

00:00:41.349 --> 00:00:43.951
that our exercises match the Common Core.

00:00:43.951 --> 00:00:45.403
Now, I want to be very clear here.

00:00:45.403 --> 00:00:48.341
Our intention isn't to just
map to the Common Core,

00:00:48.341 --> 00:00:51.403
because a lot of states
have happened to adopt it.

00:00:51.403 --> 00:00:54.945
Our intention is not to map to just
superficially take some content,

00:00:54.945 --> 00:00:59.607
and do a superficial
mapping to the Common Core.

00:00:59.607 --> 00:01:03.124
The whole purpose of why we're doing
this is, when we looked at the standards,

00:01:03.124 --> 00:01:06.327
when we looked at the items coming
out of the Assessment Consortia,

00:01:06.342 --> 00:01:07.825
from Smarter Balanced from park,

00:01:07.825 --> 00:01:10.403
we realized that this is a
very, very, very good standard.

00:01:10.403 --> 00:01:11.465
It's a rigorous standard.

00:01:11.465 --> 00:01:15.581
It's going to measure real
deep student understanding.

00:01:15.581 --> 00:01:19.263
And there's going to be a huge
need for students and teachers,

00:01:19.263 --> 00:01:24.000
and parents to have resources
where they can get practice,

00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.553
get feedback, get explanations
around Common Core subjects.

00:01:28.553 --> 00:01:32.545
What you see right over here is
a screen of our Common Core site.

00:01:32.545 --> 00:01:35.599
This is a place, this
is really a dashboard,

00:01:35.599 --> 00:01:38.959
where teachers or parents or even students
can look at Common Core standards,

00:01:38.959 --> 00:01:42.798
and then think about which Khan
Academy content maps to that standard.

00:01:42.798 --> 00:01:47.408
It's available at
kahnacademy.org/commoncore.

00:01:47.408 --> 00:01:49.041
You could go by different grade levels.

00:01:49.041 --> 00:01:53.139
Grade 7, grade 8, and you could see
the different Khan Academy exercises,

00:01:53.139 --> 00:01:56.810
that cover that standard.

00:01:56.810 --> 00:02:00.074
We're actually in process
on doing this right now.

00:02:00.735 --> 00:02:05.599
We have a team of teachers, of
professors, of graduate students,

00:02:05.599 --> 00:02:08.131
who are working closely with us.

00:02:08.131 --> 00:02:12.238
Working very closely with many of the
authors of the Common Core itself,

00:02:12.238 --> 00:02:16.784
to make sure that we
intentionally create content,

00:02:16.784 --> 00:02:21.686
that really hits at the conceptual
spirit of the Common Core.

00:02:21.686 --> 00:02:23.923
Just as a sense of the type
of team we're looking at,

00:02:23.923 --> 00:02:27.308
of the type of folks who
are working on this with us,

00:02:27.308 --> 00:02:28.920
let me show you our team page.

00:02:29.668 --> 00:02:31.543
If you go to the bottom
of any Khan Academy page,

00:02:31.543 --> 00:02:34.661
and you go to our content specialists
you'll go to this page right over here.

00:02:34.661 --> 00:02:38.320
This is a sample of the folks
who are working with us.

00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.632
Many of them are experts in developmental
mathematics, in early learning.

00:02:42.632 --> 00:02:45.217
Some of them are graduate students,
some of them are professors,

00:02:45.217 --> 00:02:47.871
of mathematics at the University level.

00:02:47.871 --> 00:02:52.134
It's a really high quality team
of folks who have been helping us,

00:02:52.134 --> 00:02:55.808
make sure that we have really deep
and really peer vetted content,

00:02:55.808 --> 00:02:58.858
intentionally created for the Common Core.

00:02:58.858 --> 00:03:02.058
Once again it's not just because 40
something states have adopted it.

00:03:02.058 --> 00:03:04.725
We like the Common Core because we think,

00:03:04.725 --> 00:03:07.556
when properly implemented, and
that's a very important thing to say.

00:03:07.556 --> 00:03:10.725
When properly implemented, it
is really trying to measure,

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.193
deep conceptual understanding.

00:03:13.193 --> 00:03:16.332
I encourage you to look at the
bios of all of these folks here,

00:03:16.332 --> 00:03:18.141
and we're constantly adding
more and more people,

00:03:18.141 --> 00:03:20.142
to collaborate on this effort.

00:03:20.142 --> 00:03:22.144
To see the type of content
that they're creating,

00:03:22.144 --> 00:03:25.874
it's anything from fairly
simple exercises like this:

00:03:25.874 --> 00:03:28.945
"Rewrite the expression 75
plus 20 in the following form."

00:03:28.945 --> 00:03:31.860
The whole point of this
is to measure or to test,

00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.547
does someone really understand
the distributive property.

00:03:34.547 --> 00:03:37.945
We've built tools and widgets so that we
can do free expression entry around it.

00:03:37.945 --> 00:03:43.195
For example, 75 plus 20 we would
want to factor out, let's see.

00:03:43.195 --> 00:03:44.724
We could factor out a 5.

00:03:44.724 --> 00:03:49.108
That's 5 times 5 times.

00:03:49.108 --> 00:03:56.466
We could write that as 15 plus 4.

00:03:56.466 --> 00:04:01.062
I should write this down as a
multiplication symbol just like this.

00:04:01.062 --> 00:04:02.203
There you have it.

00:04:02.203 --> 00:04:04.267
We've written this in the
form that they wanted,

00:04:04.267 --> 00:04:05.463
and we can check our answer.

00:04:05.463 --> 00:04:07.201
This is just a very simple
widget to understand,

00:04:07.201 --> 00:04:10.799
does someone understand factoring and
undoing the distributive property.

00:04:10.799 --> 00:04:12.679
Then there's more complicated problems.

00:04:12.679 --> 00:04:14.937
This is really the spirit
of the Common Core.

00:04:14.937 --> 00:04:17.203
A lot of people, a lot of
times in an algebra class,

00:04:17.203 --> 00:04:20.339
you'll have people talking about
functions, evaluating functions,

00:04:20.339 --> 00:04:22.197
but the spirit of the Common
Core's to really understand,

00:04:22.197 --> 00:04:24.867
what a function is saying and
really constructing functions.

00:04:24.867 --> 00:04:28.975
This is an example of a word
problem, an application problem,

00:04:28.975 --> 00:04:31.059
where the student really has
to interpret the function,

00:04:31.059 --> 00:04:35.588
to make some fairly nuance conclusions
about what's going to happen,

00:04:35.588 --> 00:04:38.934
given the data that's going on.

00:04:38.934 --> 00:04:42.217
We also have things like
this, that are widgets,

00:04:42.217 --> 00:04:46.744
that actually kind of are, for lack of
a better word, virtual manipulatives,

00:04:46.744 --> 00:04:50.535
to help build these content items.

00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:53.402
For example here, "Move each
expression to the right category,

00:04:53.402 --> 00:04:57.362
"to indicate if each one is less
than, equal to, or greater than 6/7."

00:04:57.362 --> 00:04:58.470
A student will say, "Okay, let's see."

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.546
5/7 plus 4/7, that's 9/7.

00:05:01.546 --> 00:05:04.953
That's greater than 6/7.

00:05:04.953 --> 00:05:06.472
Let's see 2 plus ...

00:05:06.472 --> 00:05:08.028
Let's see, this is going to be 5/7.

00:05:08.028 --> 00:05:09.472
That's less than.

00:05:09.472 --> 00:05:11.549
This right over here is
going to be, let's see,

00:05:11.549 --> 00:05:15.782
this is going to be exactly equal
to 6/7 and you get the general idea.

00:05:15.782 --> 00:05:17.078
Over here.

00:05:17.078 --> 00:05:18.357
Then we have things like this,

00:05:18.357 --> 00:05:20.694
and these are all written
by experts in their field.

00:05:20.694 --> 00:05:23.477
These are written by people who are
looking very closely at the standards.

00:05:23.477 --> 00:05:25.778
They're working with specialists,

00:05:25.778 --> 00:05:28.058
they're working with some of the folks
who've even written the standards,

00:05:28.058 --> 00:05:30.261
and being trained by the folks who
have been written the standards,

00:05:30.261 --> 00:05:31.464
to come up with these questions.

00:05:31.464 --> 00:05:34.409
To once again, really go at
the conceptual understanding,

00:05:34.409 --> 00:05:38.316
that the standard is trying to call out.

00:05:38.316 --> 00:05:42.855
Over here, "In the number 47,339
how many times less is the value,

00:05:42.855 --> 00:05:46.746
"of the second 3 than the
value of the first 3?"

00:05:46.746 --> 00:05:49.265
So the second 3 represents 30.

00:05:49.265 --> 00:05:51.335
It's in the tens place, it's 3 tens.

00:05:51.335 --> 00:05:53.417
This 3 is in the hundreds place,

00:05:53.417 --> 00:05:55.260
it represents 3 hundreds.

00:05:55.260 --> 00:05:58.388
30 is 10 times less than 300.

00:05:58.388 --> 00:06:00.465
You would type in 10.

00:06:00.465 --> 00:06:02.476
This is just an example.

00:06:02.476 --> 00:06:07.480
Just coming this fall we have
on the order of 100 exercises,

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:10.067
that have been intentionally
created for the Common Core.

00:06:10.067 --> 00:06:11.382
It's not just the exercises.

00:06:11.382 --> 00:06:14.459
On top of that we have a
whole series of videos,

00:06:14.459 --> 00:06:17.612
that have been intentionally
created for the Common Core as well.

00:06:17.612 --> 00:06:18.677
For example this one.

00:06:18.677 --> 00:06:20.415
This interpreting features of functions.

00:06:20.415 --> 00:06:24.880
We have a whole series of videos
that explain the underlying idea,

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:27.075
behind what's going on.

00:06:27.075 --> 00:06:30.338
As we go over the next few months
and definitely over the next year,

00:06:30.338 --> 00:06:34.040
especially because Fall of 2014 is when
you're going to have major adoption,

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:36.362
of the Common Core in most of the country,

00:06:36.362 --> 00:06:39.868
the goal is to have all of
the major standards covered,

00:06:39.868 --> 00:06:43.439
from K through high school
and then even beyond.

00:06:43.439 --> 00:06:46.959
For us to really be a super
set of the Common Core.

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:48.332
That's the goal by next Fall.

00:06:48.332 --> 00:06:50.926
Even this Fall we want to cover
most of the major standards,

00:06:50.926 --> 00:06:54.114
starting this Fall going
through middle school.

00:06:54.114 --> 00:06:57.965
We're going to be aggressively
adding content above and beyond that.

00:06:57.965 --> 00:07:00.617
For regions, whether
it's states or countries,

00:07:00.617 --> 00:07:02.460
that are not using the Common Core,

00:07:02.460 --> 00:07:05.054
I want to emphasize that we're
not doing this just to cater,

00:07:05.054 --> 00:07:06.410
to the Common Core states.

00:07:06.410 --> 00:07:10.587
We want to do this because we want
to have rigorous math content,

00:07:10.587 --> 00:07:14.387
and exercises on the site that
would hopefully allow students,

00:07:14.387 --> 00:07:17.273
to succeed in any
environment that they're in.

00:07:17.273 --> 00:07:19.150
We're really intending to be a super set.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:23.150
Not a exact covering of the Common Core.
