00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.737
- [Sal] First civilization
that we have evidence of

00:00:02.737 --> 00:00:05.768
around modern-day India and Pakistan

00:00:05.768 --> 00:00:08.693
is the Indus Valley Civilization,

00:00:08.693 --> 00:00:11.929
and it's right around the Indus River

00:00:11.929 --> 00:00:15.842
in modern-day Pakistan
and northwest India.

00:00:15.842 --> 00:00:17.967
In other videos we talk about how

00:00:17.967 --> 00:00:21.914
it really comes into being
in the Third Millennium BCE,

00:00:21.914 --> 00:00:25.553
and as we enter into the
Second Millennium BCE

00:00:25.553 --> 00:00:26.981
it starts to decline.

00:00:26.981 --> 00:00:28.955
We don't know exactly why it declined.

00:00:28.955 --> 00:00:31.726
Might have been climate
change, drying up of a river.

00:00:31.726 --> 00:00:33.604
Might have been a natural disaster.

00:00:33.604 --> 00:00:36.321
It might have been an
influence of other peoples.

00:00:36.321 --> 00:00:38.687
We're gonna talk about
in this video is the next

00:00:38.687 --> 00:00:42.587
significant period in the
history of South Asia,

00:00:42.587 --> 00:00:46.692
and it involves the
migration or the introduction

00:00:46.692 --> 00:00:48.540
of another group of people,

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.433
we believe another group of people,

00:00:50.433 --> 00:00:53.022
and that's the Indo-Aryans.

00:00:53.022 --> 00:00:54.322
Write this down.

00:00:54.322 --> 00:00:58.489
Indo-Aryans, sometimes
referred to as just the Aryans,

00:00:59.732 --> 00:01:02.315
who we believe began to migrate

00:01:03.934 --> 00:01:07.450
into modern-day Pakistan
and northwest India

00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.656
at right about the same time that

00:01:09.656 --> 00:01:13.034
the Indus Valley
Civilization was declining.

00:01:13.034 --> 00:01:16.111
Some historians actually believe maybe

00:01:16.111 --> 00:01:18.154
Indus Valley Civilization
declined because of them.

00:01:18.154 --> 00:01:20.128
Maybe it was some type of an invasion.

00:01:20.128 --> 00:01:24.505
Although that theory is
not as widely held anymore.

00:01:24.505 --> 00:01:27.094
Some folks believe that the
Indus Valley Civilization

00:01:27.094 --> 00:01:31.018
and this Indo-Aryan
migration somehow merged.

00:01:31.018 --> 00:01:32.945
But this period that we're talking about,

00:01:32.945 --> 00:01:36.068
with the migration of these Indo-Aryans,

00:01:36.068 --> 00:01:39.807
this is called the Vedic
Period, or the Vedic Period.

00:01:39.807 --> 00:01:42.419
It's called the Vedic Period because

00:01:42.419 --> 00:01:46.564
we learn about it from a
collection of literary works

00:01:46.564 --> 00:01:50.731
that we get from that time,
most famously the Vedas.

00:01:51.939 --> 00:01:53.878
Veda comes from Sanskrit,

00:01:53.878 --> 00:01:57.080
and Sanskrit is the language of the Vedas.

00:01:57.080 --> 00:02:00.725
Vedas, in Sanskrit, means: knowledge.

00:02:00.725 --> 00:02:03.430
And they're the foundation of, one,

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:05.891
what we know about the Vedic Period,

00:02:05.891 --> 00:02:07.586
but they're also the foundation

00:02:07.586 --> 00:02:10.753
of modern Indian culture and religion.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:15.573
The primary pieces of the Vedas

00:02:16.453 --> 00:02:19.036
are the Rigveda, the Yajurveda,

00:02:20.331 --> 00:02:23.138
the Samaveda, and the Atharvaveda..

00:02:23.138 --> 00:02:25.111
The Rigveda in particular is considered

00:02:25.111 --> 00:02:27.411
the oldest of the Vedas.

00:02:27.411 --> 00:02:30.681
It's believed that it was composed around

00:02:30.681 --> 00:02:32.933
the early part of that Vedic Period,

00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:36.516
between maybe 1500 BCE
and around 1200 BCE.

00:02:39.945 --> 00:02:43.862
We're talking between
3,000 and 3500 years ago,

00:02:44.784 --> 00:02:48.917
while these three Vedas we
believe were composed later.

00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.365
Now, these Indo-Aryans, it's believed,

00:02:52.365 --> 00:02:54.293
were essentially pastoralists;

00:02:54.293 --> 00:02:56.951
they were cattle herders, perhaps nomadic.

00:02:56.951 --> 00:03:00.202
But as they began to settle not
just the Indus River Valley,

00:03:00.202 --> 00:03:03.279
they actually began to settle
the entire Gangetic Plain,

00:03:03.279 --> 00:03:04.835
which would include this area,

00:03:04.835 --> 00:03:06.518
which would be northeast India

00:03:06.518 --> 00:03:09.229
as well as countries like Bangladesh.

00:03:09.229 --> 00:03:10.947
The Indus and the Ganges are two

00:03:10.947 --> 00:03:13.617
of the most significant rivers in India.

00:03:13.617 --> 00:03:16.334
But as they started to
settle the Gangetic Plain

00:03:16.334 --> 00:03:19.498
they also became more traditional farmers.

00:03:19.498 --> 00:03:21.996
In this green here, I've highlighted

00:03:21.996 --> 00:03:23.854
when they became more farmers,

00:03:23.854 --> 00:03:26.141
and started to have more settled kingdoms,

00:03:26.141 --> 00:03:29.009
or we believe started to
have more settled kingdoms.

00:03:29.009 --> 00:03:32.004
Other significant Hindu epics,

00:03:32.004 --> 00:03:33.938
we believe the events of the them

00:03:33.938 --> 00:03:36.726
happened around that late Vedic Period.

00:03:36.726 --> 00:03:39.548
The events of the
Mahabharata and the Ramayana.

00:03:39.548 --> 00:03:42.404
Now, the Vedas and these epic poems

00:03:42.404 --> 00:03:44.726
were originally orally transmitted.

00:03:44.726 --> 00:03:47.199
But then, later, either
in the late Vedic Period

00:03:47.199 --> 00:03:48.708
or after the Vedic Period

00:03:48.708 --> 00:03:51.947
was when they were actually written down.

00:03:51.947 --> 00:03:54.525
Just so you have some context here,

00:03:54.525 --> 00:03:58.147
Sanskrit is considered one of the oldest

00:03:58.147 --> 00:04:00.364
Indo-European languages we have.

00:04:00.364 --> 00:04:01.797
I'll talk more about Indo-European

00:04:01.797 --> 00:04:02.778
languages in a little bit.

00:04:02.778 --> 00:04:05.457
Because it turns out
that Sanskrit is related

00:04:05.457 --> 00:04:08.232
to European languages like Greek and Latin

00:04:08.232 --> 00:04:10.577
and even Germanic languages.

00:04:10.577 --> 00:04:12.098
Sanskrit's one of the oldest,

00:04:12.098 --> 00:04:16.265
alongside Mycenaean Greek
and the Hittite Language.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.204
Those were all contemporary civilizations

00:04:19.204 --> 00:04:21.142
of around this period right over here,

00:04:21.142 --> 00:04:24.300
in the Second Millennium BCE.

00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:28.271
Just so have you context,
Siddhartha Gautama Buddha,

00:04:28.271 --> 00:04:31.408
his life was in one of
these Vedic kingdoms

00:04:31.408 --> 00:04:33.575
in the northeast of India.

00:04:34.566 --> 00:04:37.898
Now, as I mentioned, the
Vedas laid the foundation

00:04:37.898 --> 00:04:40.684
for much of what we consider
to be modern-day India.

00:04:40.684 --> 00:04:43.111
In fact, the first documented reference

00:04:43.111 --> 00:04:46.060
to the Indus River we have from the Vedas.

00:04:46.060 --> 00:04:47.581
The Indus Valley Civilization,

00:04:47.581 --> 00:04:49.264
we haven't been able to
decipher their writing.

00:04:49.264 --> 00:04:51.081
They didn't write down the word Indus.

00:04:51.081 --> 00:04:55.353
It was in the Vedas that
we have the word sindhu,

00:04:55.353 --> 00:04:59.103
and sindhu was later
changed or mispronounced

00:05:00.424 --> 00:05:03.137
or pronounced differently into other words

00:05:03.137 --> 00:05:05.076
that we now associate with India.

00:05:05.076 --> 00:05:08.199
Words like Hindu, Indus, and India,

00:05:08.199 --> 00:05:10.616
they all derived from Sindhu,

00:05:11.699 --> 00:05:14.735
which was the River
referred to in the Vedas,

00:05:14.735 --> 00:05:19.658
and then changed into Hindu,
Indus, and things like India.

00:05:19.658 --> 00:05:22.991
Now, also in the Vedas is the first time

00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:28.097
that we have reference to a
stratified social structure,

00:05:29.549 --> 00:05:33.716
and we see that with the
varnas that are referred to.

00:05:35.026 --> 00:05:37.977
You could view these as
social roles or classes.

00:05:37.977 --> 00:05:39.254
At the top you have the brahmins:

00:05:39.254 --> 00:05:41.228
the priests, the scholars,
and the teachers.

00:05:41.228 --> 00:05:43.028
Then the next you have
the kings and the warriors

00:05:43.028 --> 00:05:46.023
referred to as the kshatriyas.

00:05:46.023 --> 00:05:47.788
Then the vaishyas, who are the farmers,

00:05:47.788 --> 00:05:49.181
the merchants, the artisans.

00:05:49.181 --> 00:05:51.073
Then the shudras: the laborers.

00:05:51.073 --> 00:05:54.847
Now, some historians and
Vedic scholars believe

00:05:54.847 --> 00:05:57.480
that these reference to the varnas

00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:00.045
were added after the Vedic Period

00:06:00.045 --> 00:06:01.972
to things like the Rigveda;

00:06:01.972 --> 00:06:04.759
and some believe that these
weren't traditional casts,

00:06:04.759 --> 00:06:06.152
as it's sometimes perceived today,

00:06:06.152 --> 00:06:08.752
but just a reference to
different social strata,

00:06:08.752 --> 00:06:10.389
that it wasn't necessarily inherited.

00:06:10.389 --> 00:06:13.257
We are not actually sure about that.

00:06:13.257 --> 00:06:16.415
But just to give you a feel
of what was in the Rigveda.

00:06:16.415 --> 00:06:18.598
I encourage you to go look
at the actual primary text,

00:06:18.598 --> 00:06:20.153
and there's a lot out there to read.

00:06:20.153 --> 00:06:23.938
It includes prayers; it
includes praise of the gods;

00:06:23.938 --> 00:06:25.912
it includes rituals; but it also has

00:06:25.912 --> 00:06:28.199
a lot of interesting philosophy.

00:06:28.199 --> 00:06:31.782
And, for example, this
is from the Rigveda.

00:06:33.377 --> 00:06:37.127
This is a hymn referred
to as Nasadiya Sukta,

00:06:38.311 --> 00:06:41.811
and it's in the 10th book, the 129th hymn.

00:06:43.321 --> 00:06:45.827
I find it really
interesting because it shows

00:06:45.827 --> 00:06:48.739
a fairly mature philosophical attitude.

00:06:48.739 --> 00:06:50.992
This is actually the origin hymn,

00:06:50.992 --> 00:06:52.025
and this is just a part of it.

00:06:52.025 --> 00:06:54.158
We're talking about the
origin of the universe.

00:06:54.158 --> 00:06:55.658
"Who really knows?

00:06:56.522 --> 00:06:58.564
"Who will here proclaim it?

00:06:58.564 --> 00:06:59.922
"Whence was it produced?

00:06:59.922 --> 00:07:01.966
"Whence is this creation?

00:07:01.966 --> 00:07:06.313
"Gods came afterward, with
the creation of this universe.

00:07:06.313 --> 00:07:08.763
"Who then knows whence it has arisen?

00:07:08.763 --> 00:07:12.269
"Whether God's will created
it, or whether He was mute.

00:07:12.269 --> 00:07:15.961
"Perhaps it formed itself,
or perhaps it did not.

00:07:15.961 --> 00:07:20.222
"Only He who is the overseer
in highest heaven knows.

00:07:20.222 --> 00:07:24.193
"Only He knows, or
perhaps He does not know."

00:07:24.193 --> 00:07:28.148
I just find it interesting
because it takes a very

00:07:28.148 --> 00:07:31.187
philosophical view towards
this very fundamental question

00:07:31.187 --> 00:07:34.946
of the origin of the actual universe.

00:07:34.946 --> 00:07:38.011
So the Vedic Period, very
important period in India.

00:07:38.011 --> 00:07:41.262
It really lays the foundation
for what we consider

00:07:41.262 --> 00:07:44.663
to be modern Hinduism, modern-day India.

00:07:44.663 --> 00:07:47.531
It starts as really a
Bronze-Age civilization,

00:07:47.531 --> 00:07:49.505
but as we get into the later Vedic Period,

00:07:49.505 --> 00:07:52.991
we see them smelting iron,
and creating iron tools,

00:07:52.991 --> 00:07:54.906
and things like that.

00:07:54.906 --> 00:07:56.752
And, as we'll see in the next video,

00:07:56.752 --> 00:07:59.178
the language of the Vedas, the Sanskrit,

00:07:59.178 --> 00:08:02.361
when Western scholars
started to discover it,

00:08:02.361 --> 00:08:04.307
it opened up their minds as to what were

00:08:04.307 --> 00:08:06.930
the roots of many of
the peoples who settle

00:08:06.930 --> 00:08:10.013
not just north India but also Europe.
