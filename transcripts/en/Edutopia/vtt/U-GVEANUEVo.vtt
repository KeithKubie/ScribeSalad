00:00:10.766 --> 00:00:12.076
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The burgeoning
realm of games

00:00:12.386 --> 00:00:15.156
and simulations has become
a billion-dollar industry.

00:00:17.546 --> 00:00:19.386
Employing cutting-edge technology,

00:00:19.806 --> 00:00:23.806
many of the world's best minds are
creating products that bedazzle

00:00:23.806 --> 00:00:28.306
and engage players of all ages in
everything from killing bad guys,

00:00:28.966 --> 00:00:30.796
to performing life-saving surgeries.

00:00:31.846 --> 00:00:33.016
&gt;&gt;Man: If we tilt the skull

00:00:33.016 --> 00:00:35.536
down a little bit we can
see these others, here's...

00:00:35.596 --> 00:00:39.766
&gt;&gt;Douglas: There's little doubt in
anyone's mind that putting the people

00:00:39.766 --> 00:00:42.986
into an environment where they can
experience the things that they need

00:00:42.986 --> 00:00:44.796
to learn, they can make mistakes

00:00:44.796 --> 00:00:47.316
without risk, they
can try new things.

00:00:47.316 --> 00:00:50.796
The engagement that comes from that
type of environment is a better way

00:00:50.796 --> 00:00:53.496
to learn than just
sitting them in a classroom

00:00:53.496 --> 00:00:56.026
and just throwing information
at them.

00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:59.326
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Clients such as the
U.S. Military spend millions

00:00:59.326 --> 00:01:02.326
to train personnel in
simulated environments

00:01:02.326 --> 00:01:04.976
like this virtual residency
called Pulse.

00:01:05.586 --> 00:01:07.436
&gt;&gt;Douglas: The first
version of Pulse was built

00:01:07.436 --> 00:01:10.466
to model Bethesda Naval
Medical Intensive Care Unit.

00:01:10.986 --> 00:01:13.856
You work with other care
givers, doctors and nurses,

00:01:14.266 --> 00:01:16.996
and you can see the things that you
would be seeing in the real world.

00:01:17.656 --> 00:01:20.176
You can shine the light
on the pupil and based

00:01:20.176 --> 00:01:22.256
on the physiological
condition of that patient,

00:01:22.766 --> 00:01:24.456
the eye will dilate appropriately.

00:01:24.916 --> 00:01:28.046
You can check their ears, touch
them, feel them, listen to them

00:01:28.476 --> 00:01:31.236
in the virtual world so that
you can do the diagnosis

00:01:31.336 --> 00:01:34.526
and that's what we want to
replicate is the real experience

00:01:34.596 --> 00:01:36.886
that the doctor or nurse
would have in the real world.

00:01:37.836 --> 00:01:39.766
&gt;&gt;Narrator: These days
engaging simulations

00:01:39.766 --> 00:01:43.226
and games can be found just about
anywhere critical thinking happens.

00:01:43.966 --> 00:01:46.416
Anywhere, that is,
except the classroom.

00:01:46.416 --> 00:01:48.846
&gt;&gt;Teacher: X over 360.

00:01:48.936 --> 00:01:51.326
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Our schools are in
trouble if our response to things

00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.336
like cellphones and new
technology is to ban them,

00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:56.316
is to say "Well you can't
bring that into school."

00:01:56.316 --> 00:01:58.626
And games I think really
are the cutting edge

00:01:58.626 --> 00:02:00.906
because they probably more
than anything are good

00:02:00.906 --> 00:02:03.486
at letting people start as
novices and become experts.

00:02:03.736 --> 00:02:04.006
&gt;&gt;Student: See?

00:02:04.006 --> 00:02:05.306
&gt;&gt;Student: Oh yeah.

00:02:05.306 --> 00:02:07.166
&gt;&gt;David: We don't live in an
industrial economy anymore.

00:02:07.406 --> 00:02:10.006
We live in a knowledge economy and
so we have to think about education

00:02:10.226 --> 00:02:11.736
in a fundamentally different way.

00:02:11.986 --> 00:02:15.056
We can't be focusing on
basic facts and basic skills.

00:02:15.056 --> 00:02:17.316
We have to think about ways
of thinking that are going

00:02:17.476 --> 00:02:20.876
to matter more than what we do
in traditional schools right now.

00:02:20.876 --> 00:02:22.666
&gt;&gt;Kurt: On the Wii we
can do some of that.

00:02:22.856 --> 00:02:26.146
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Kurt Squire and
David Williamson Shaffer research

00:02:26.146 --> 00:02:28.946
educational games at the
University of Wisconsin.

00:02:29.446 --> 00:02:34.236
In one study Squire gauged the impact
of the game Civilization on a group

00:02:34.236 --> 00:02:36.136
of fourth, fifth, and sixth graders.

00:02:36.476 --> 00:02:38.666
&gt;&gt;Kurt: A lot of the kids
come in hating school

00:02:38.666 --> 00:02:40.646
and in particular really
hating social studies.

00:02:40.646 --> 00:02:42.566
And we start them off just
playing the game for fun,

00:02:42.706 --> 00:02:44.246
seeing if they can't get
involved in the game.

00:02:44.246 --> 00:02:45.516
It's really quite complex.

00:02:45.516 --> 00:02:47.086
There's a lot of historical
vocabulary,

00:02:47.376 --> 00:02:49.256
a lot of maps, a lot of terminology.

00:02:49.456 --> 00:02:52.206
They start to think about the
model as a simulation of history

00:02:52.206 --> 00:02:52.996
that they can think with.

00:02:52.996 --> 00:02:54.916
So they start thinking
about how does technology

00:02:54.916 --> 00:02:58.186
and geography influence the way
civilizations grow and fade?

00:02:58.186 --> 00:03:02.196
From there we find they usually start
producing their own games and all

00:03:02.196 --> 00:03:04.126
of them now that we work with
have gone to straight "A"s

00:03:04.126 --> 00:03:06.006
in social studies and other areas.

00:03:06.006 --> 00:03:08.026
And these are 10 and
11 year old kids.

00:03:08.376 --> 00:03:09.946
If you look at one of the
biggest crisis right now

00:03:09.946 --> 00:03:13.046
in schools it's underachieving
boys who become labeled A.D.H.D.

00:03:13.046 --> 00:03:15.516
and then they're starting on the
social problems, fighting and so on.

00:03:15.756 --> 00:03:18.366
And teachers are really running and
"What do we do with these kids?"

00:03:18.366 --> 00:03:20.396
And we think games is a
really powerful way to tap

00:03:20.536 --> 00:03:22.726
into their interests and channel
it towards something that's

00:03:22.726 --> 00:03:23.336
more positive.

00:03:23.336 --> 00:03:24.936
The kids certainly love it.

00:03:24.936 --> 00:03:26.186
&gt;&gt;Teacher: It's already 9:50.

00:03:26.396 --> 00:03:29.256
We've got two hours
to work on this exam.

00:03:29.256 --> 00:03:32.376
What I want you to try
to do is do a 3D version

00:03:32.376 --> 00:03:34.476
of a Donkey Kong animation.

00:03:34.856 --> 00:03:36.666
&gt;&gt;Narrator: McKinley
Technology High School

00:03:36.666 --> 00:03:40.506
in Washington D.C. has embraced
the brave new virtual world.

00:03:40.506 --> 00:03:41.326
&gt;&gt;Teacher: Any questions?

00:03:41.586 --> 00:03:43.466
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Plagued by
declining enrollment

00:03:43.466 --> 00:03:48.306
and campus violence the
school was shut down in 1997

00:03:48.306 --> 00:03:53.326
and reopened six years later as a
tech magnet with the latest hardware

00:03:53.626 --> 00:03:57.926
and a revamped curriculum focusing
on biotechnology and digital media.

00:03:57.926 --> 00:04:00.566
&gt;&gt;Teacher: And then you're actually
controlling the camera, that's good.

00:04:00.676 --> 00:04:02.826
Switch it so you're
looking through that camera.

00:04:03.016 --> 00:04:05.646
&gt;&gt;Daniel: We want our
students not to be consumers

00:04:06.066 --> 00:04:10.536
of simulation technology, but
designers of simulation technology

00:04:10.856 --> 00:04:14.126
where they are determining the
structure of how that story is told.

00:04:14.786 --> 00:04:18.376
For that is where one is able to
be creative and personalize it.

00:04:18.596 --> 00:04:20.566
&gt;&gt;Student: You need to
move our your camera.

00:04:20.566 --> 00:04:21.316
&gt;&gt;Student: I'm saying it's locked.

00:04:21.536 --> 00:04:23.436
&gt;&gt;Student: But you still
need to move your camera.

00:04:23.876 --> 00:04:26.246
&gt;&gt;Daniel: By enabling them
to have the technical skills,

00:04:26.836 --> 00:04:29.236
they're able to express
individualization

00:04:29.406 --> 00:04:30.866
and creative skills.

00:04:30.866 --> 00:04:35.966
&gt;&gt;Ciarra: Basically what I did was
I made the stadium and the stage

00:04:35.966 --> 00:04:37.126
and all the chairs and everything.

00:04:37.126 --> 00:04:40.136
Even though you see there's a
whole bunch of chairs around,

00:04:40.136 --> 00:04:42.296
it actually didn't take
that long at all to do.

00:04:42.296 --> 00:04:44.196
That was actually the easiest part.

00:04:44.356 --> 00:04:47.436
&gt;&gt;Daniel: By bringing the students
and the technologies together,

00:04:47.916 --> 00:04:52.926
we are able to insure that the kids
see connections beyond just the

00:04:52.926 --> 00:04:57.596
standard written text or the math
problem, to see why math feeds

00:04:57.706 --> 00:05:03.156
into videogame design, how algebra,
physics, and geometry are part

00:05:03.156 --> 00:05:07.206
of what must be considered when
trying to design an engaging

00:05:07.206 --> 00:05:08.306
and interactive experience.

00:05:08.766 --> 00:05:12.356
&gt;&gt;Student: So basically this is the
American Red Cross Fire Safety game

00:05:12.356 --> 00:05:15.596
that a couple of students at McKinley
and myself created during the summer.

00:05:15.666 --> 00:05:17.516
We spent six weeks doing it.

00:05:17.686 --> 00:05:20.486
There's three to four different
rooms because we have the bedroom,

00:05:20.776 --> 00:05:22.716
the bathroom, and the family room.

00:05:23.056 --> 00:05:25.386
The purpose of the
game is to go through

00:05:25.486 --> 00:05:26.576
and assess all of the fire hazards.

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:29.986
And what happens when you see a
hazard, you have to click on it

00:05:29.986 --> 00:05:32.566
and then it zooms in and it
gives you a little excerpt

00:05:32.566 --> 00:05:36.156
about the fire hazard like "Don't
overload plugs" and things like that.

00:05:36.276 --> 00:05:39.266
&gt;&gt;Ciarra: Just the energy
of McKinley is so different.

00:05:39.266 --> 00:05:40.306
It makes you want to learn.

00:05:40.306 --> 00:05:44.226
They teach us programming and
animation and 3D modeling and Maya

00:05:44.226 --> 00:05:48.006
and things like that and
that's really exciting.

00:05:48.006 --> 00:05:50.736
&gt;&gt;Narrator: McKinley students
are also asked to test games

00:05:50.736 --> 00:05:55.416
and simulations like this virtual lab
developed and distributed for free

00:05:55.566 --> 00:05:57.716
by the Howard Hughes
Medical Institute.

00:05:58.136 --> 00:06:01.146
&gt;&gt;Dennis: There is no question that
some of our virtual labs for example,

00:06:01.546 --> 00:06:06.476
the Bacterial I.D. lab which
involves obtaining D.N.A. sequence,

00:06:06.816 --> 00:06:09.706
using that to identify
an unknown microbe.

00:06:10.156 --> 00:06:13.806
That's the kind of
experiment that is hard to do

00:06:13.806 --> 00:06:17.256
in most high school settings
so it does allow some teachers

00:06:17.576 --> 00:06:19.606
to expose students to things

00:06:19.606 --> 00:06:21.616
that they wouldn't be
able to do otherwise.

00:06:22.266 --> 00:06:25.076
The other thing that
animation and media is good

00:06:25.226 --> 00:06:30.006
for is revealing the hidden worlds
that simply aren't tangible to people

00:06:30.006 --> 00:06:34.316
in any other way and you can tell
people it's exciting and interesting,

00:06:34.316 --> 00:06:36.006
but it's always better
to just show them.

00:06:36.006 --> 00:06:39.856
&gt;&gt;Eitan: And this is actually how
your body deals with some sort

00:06:39.856 --> 00:06:43.036
of bacterial infection, how
it clears it out, you know,

00:06:43.096 --> 00:06:44.386
minus the really cool graphics.

00:06:44.386 --> 00:06:49.246
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Another game McKinley
students helped incubate is Immune

00:06:49.296 --> 00:06:52.426
Attack, a multimillion
dollar project underwritten

00:06:52.426 --> 00:06:54.686
by the Federation of
American Scientists.

00:06:54.686 --> 00:06:56.056
&gt;&gt;Eitan: In the game you have

00:06:56.096 --> 00:06:59.976
to reactivate somebody's defunct
immune system and teach them how

00:06:59.976 --> 00:07:01.936
to cope with bacterial
and viral infections.

00:07:01.936 --> 00:07:03.856
&gt;&gt;Student: That's the macrophage?

00:07:03.856 --> 00:07:05.976
&gt;&gt;Etian: Yep, that's the
macrophage right there.

00:07:05.976 --> 00:07:08.826
&gt;&gt;Every month or so we have a new
build that we're very interested

00:07:08.826 --> 00:07:11.006
in getting feedback from
students how does this work?

00:07:11.396 --> 00:07:12.636
What's complicated about this?

00:07:12.636 --> 00:07:13.486
What's clear?

00:07:13.756 --> 00:07:14.926
How can we improve the game?

00:07:15.006 --> 00:07:18.286
And more recently we've taken on
two McKinley high school seniors

00:07:18.286 --> 00:07:21.006
as interns at FAS and
they're actually helping

00:07:21.006 --> 00:07:24.826
to develop the game now so it's
been a very mutually beneficial

00:07:24.866 --> 00:07:26.756
relationship working with
McKinley High School.

00:07:28.496 --> 00:07:31.496
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Whether they are
debugging simulations for scientists

00:07:31.766 --> 00:07:34.226
or test driving the
latest commercial games,

00:07:34.626 --> 00:07:36.746
kids seem hard-wired to the task.

00:07:37.506 --> 00:07:40.936
And with a little guidance they
can become expert designers.

00:07:40.936 --> 00:07:42.676
&gt;&gt;Eric: What should these guys do?

00:07:42.676 --> 00:07:45.756
&gt;&gt;Ben: Again, knock you
back, but then roll over you.

00:07:45.976 --> 00:07:46.296
&gt;&gt;Eric: Okay.

00:07:46.616 --> 00:07:48.846
&gt;&gt;Narrator: When he
was 9 cancer patient,

00:07:48.846 --> 00:07:53.466
Ben Duskin approached the Make-A-Wish
Foundation with an unusual request.

00:07:53.986 --> 00:07:56.856
&gt;&gt;Eric: His wish was
to make a video game

00:07:57.096 --> 00:08:00.366
where the player fights cancer
cells so that he could send it back

00:08:00.366 --> 00:08:02.136
to the kids who were still
in the treatment center.

00:08:02.266 --> 00:08:04.156
This was just after he
had finished his chemo.

00:08:04.316 --> 00:08:07.856
And Ben was in a position to
know uniquely what would help

00:08:08.186 --> 00:08:11.756
and his primary motive was
to distract and entertain.

00:08:12.506 --> 00:08:14.676
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Enlisting the
aid of Software Engineer,

00:08:14.676 --> 00:08:19.496
Eric Johnston Ben designed a game
that is engaging and enlightening.

00:08:19.876 --> 00:08:23.856
&gt;&gt;Eric: One of the things that was I
think a fantastic idea of Ben's was

00:08:23.966 --> 00:08:27.826
to take the side effects, not
the cancer cells themselves,

00:08:27.986 --> 00:08:30.416
but the side effects are
represented in the game

00:08:30.416 --> 00:08:32.486
as the monsters, a
monster for each one.

00:08:32.486 --> 00:08:36.086
So there's a giant chicken for
chicken pox, and there's a robot

00:08:36.086 --> 00:08:39.246
that flings barf at you
that's the vomit monster.

00:08:39.586 --> 00:08:42.386
By making those monsters
large and then

00:08:42.386 --> 00:08:46.346
as you attack them they grow smaller
and smaller and less scary was a part

00:08:46.346 --> 00:08:48.276
of making the game engaging.

00:08:48.476 --> 00:08:51.546
&gt;&gt;Right, so now we've got
billiard balls shooting at us.

00:08:51.606 --> 00:08:55.526
&gt;&gt;For parents and siblings it
really provided a look into how

00:08:55.636 --> 00:08:58.176
from the kids' point of view,
how the treatment process looks.

00:08:58.216 --> 00:08:58.776
&gt;&gt;Ben: Whoa!

00:08:59.106 --> 00:09:00.976
&gt;&gt;Eric: Oh yeah, I added that.

00:09:01.326 --> 00:09:04.226
&gt;&gt;David: We have technologies that
can help kids learn in new ways

00:09:04.366 --> 00:09:07.576
and we can essentially build
models of what an education

00:09:07.576 --> 00:09:08.876
for the future might look like.

00:09:09.306 --> 00:09:12.536
And my hope in doing that
is that parents and teachers

00:09:12.536 --> 00:09:15.576
and school board members, and
kids, and politicians and all

00:09:15.576 --> 00:09:19.126
of us will look at what happens in
these environments and say "Wow,

00:09:19.536 --> 00:09:21.126
why can't school be more like that?"

00:09:21.506 --> 00:09:23.416
&gt;&gt;Teacher: You're going to have
three choices for what you want

00:09:23.416 --> 00:09:24.686
to work on during this class.

00:09:25.166 --> 00:09:28.166
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Seeing their potential
to transform public education,

00:09:28.396 --> 00:09:30.826
the Federation of American
Scientists has called

00:09:30.826 --> 00:09:34.226
for a major federal effort
to fund serious games.

00:09:34.716 --> 00:09:36.876
&gt;&gt;Henry: The potential
here is so huge

00:09:36.916 --> 00:09:39.996
that it just seems a national
shame that we're not putting money

00:09:39.996 --> 00:09:41.836
on the table to find
out if this is right.

00:09:41.936 --> 00:09:44.136
I mean the payoff is spectacular.

00:09:44.276 --> 00:09:46.306
You have to think about
using this technology

00:09:46.396 --> 00:09:49.696
that could actually completely
transform productivity in education

00:09:49.696 --> 00:09:52.476
and get people who are otherwise
be uninterested or underserved

00:09:52.476 --> 00:09:54.656
by this system fully engaged,

00:09:54.656 --> 00:09:56.796
and we just can't afford
to leave anybody behind.

00:09:57.046 --> 00:09:58.676
&gt;&gt;Student: Land, that's
like geography.

00:09:58.676 --> 00:09:59.116
&gt;&gt;Student: That's geography.

00:09:59.116 --> 00:10:01.866
&gt;&gt;Douglas: I think the advances
in technology these days are going

00:10:01.906 --> 00:10:05.916
to allow the gaming and simulation
community to create simulations

00:10:05.916 --> 00:10:07.756
of anything, and when we can deploy

00:10:07.756 --> 00:10:10.216
that over the Internet
we will then have

00:10:10.266 --> 00:10:15.136
on every desktop the best teacher in
the world available to every student.

00:10:16.096 --> 00:10:18.226
&gt;&gt;Kurt: Good games are really
compelling for their players

00:10:18.226 --> 00:10:20.886
to the point that people are
worried about addiction and things.

00:10:20.886 --> 00:10:23.046
And you know it's ironic, can
you imagine is there a world

00:10:23.046 --> 00:10:24.676
in which we'd have
addiction to school?

00:10:24.676 --> 00:10:26.396
You know, someone would walk
in and say "I'm addicted

00:10:26.396 --> 00:10:26.976
to learning, I need more."

00:10:27.636 --> 00:10:29.016
&gt;&gt;Students: Whoo!

00:10:30.046 --> 00:10:33.016
