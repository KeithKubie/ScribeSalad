00:00:03.020 --> 00:00:08.440
After years of hard work as a student of
engineering, you’ve landed a role as an engineer
in a big company.

00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:09.540
Congratulations!

00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.080
Your new job even gives you a fancy office
in a skyscraper. It’s a sweet deal!

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:17.160
Until one day, a terrible storm hits the city.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.900
That doesn’t bother you too much at first;
a bit of wind doesn’t seem like a big deal when
you’re in an office.

00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:26.560
But as you’re working at your desk, you
notice the entire skyscraper begins to sway
in the wind.

00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:33.920
In fact, the building tilts so much, your pencil
rolls right off your desk and the view outside your
window starts to angle toward the sky.

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.220
In 1978, the Citicorp building in Manhattan
came dangerously close to that scenario.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.000
If a powerful enough storm had happened
before anyone realized, key parts of the structure
could have failed.

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.260
And all because the engineers who designed
it didn’t account for how all the forces acting on
the structure could affect its stability.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:58.600
But by considering those forces and how to counteract them, an industrious team of engineers managed to save the Citicorp building before any disasters happened.

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:08.900
[Theme Music]

00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:16.200
A force, as you’ll recall, is any interaction
with an object that, if unopposed, would cause
it to accelerate, or change its momentum.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:23.440
Like, with the skyscraper, you don’t want forces
like the wind seriously deforming the structures you
build or even causing them to collapse entirely.

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.780
So it’s important to design things to be
able to withstand the forces they may encounter.

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:34.340
When the Citicorp tower was first built, it had
a slightly unusual structure to accommodate a
church on the corner of the block it was built on.

00:01:34.340 --> 00:01:42.000
The whole building was raised on nine-story-high stilts,
but because of the church, the stilts needed to be in the
middle of each side rather than in the corners.

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.360
Which meant quartering winds, which blow
diagonally to the faces of a building rather than
straight on, became a problem.

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:53.900
Ordinarily, these winds aren’t a huge issue
since they blow past the structure without
applying much force to it.

00:01:53.900 --> 00:02:01.160
Unfortunately, having those columns on the building’s
sides made it more vulnerable to quartering winds than
the engineers originally thought!

00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:04.420
And they didn’t notice until after the
building had been built,

00:02:04.420 --> 00:02:11.740
when a student writing a paper on the Citicorp
building realized there was a problem and brought it
to the attention of the lead structural engineer.

00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:16.600
Essentially, they’d made a critical mistake
when they calculated the building’s statics
and dynamics.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:22.200
Both of these are branches of mechanics,
a field that considers how forces affect a
structure’s behavior.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:27.660
Statics, as the name implies, is about what
happens to objects that don’t accelerate
when a force is applied.

00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:34.380
All the forces acting on the object balance
out, keeping it rigid – it doesn’t rotate or move
from its original position.

00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:38.700
When this happens, we’d say the object is
in static equilibrium with its environment.

00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:43.320
Dynamics on the other hand, deals with what
happens when the various forces don’t cancel out.

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:51.820
If the structure isn’t held in place by friction or attached
to its surroundings some other way, a large enough
force will cause it to move, rotate, or deform.

00:02:51.820 --> 00:02:56.060
That’s when dynamics comes into play, and
you’d have to consider the object’s motion.

00:02:56.069 --> 00:03:01.240
The good news about that is that the same
basic idea governs both statics and dynamics:

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.700
Newton’s second law of motion, which says
that the force acting on an object is equal to
its mass times its acceleration.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.880
But an object like a building or bridge is
made of many connecting parts.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:19.120
If the mass is distributed throughout the structure,
a force applied at one part of that structure won’t
affect the entire thing in the same way.

00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:24.580
It’s also important to note that Newton’s
second law assumes the force acts in a
given direction.

00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:27.840
So in reality, it’s not quite as simple
as “F” equals “m” “a”.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.020
Instead, you have to consider the direction
the force is applied in, which also determines
the direction of the acceleration.

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:40.900
Quantities that have both a magnitude and direction
are called vectors, and you have to take the direction
into account when you add them together.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:44.420
Both the “F” and “a” in Newton’s
second law are really vectors.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:52.420
To know the final motion or overall force acting
on a structure, you need to add all the forces acting
in different directions on each part of it.

00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.200
That might sound like a lot to consider, but
there’s a clever way to keep track of all of it.

00:03:56.200 --> 00:04:02.840
As we’ve mentioned, in statics, we’re
looking at a situation where all the forces
are balanced to zero – static equilibrium.

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:07.080
These calculations are important for making
sure your structure is never on the verge of failure.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:11.500
Objects can only handle a certain amount
of stress before they deform or break.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.480
Statics helps you work out the force that
parts of the structure are experiencing under
a load.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.400
Since by definition, all the forces on the
structure have to cancel out to zero,

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:24.080
if you know some of the forces acting on it,
you can usually figure out the others.

00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:31.100
To make sense of all this, engineers use what’s
called a free body diagram – a sketch of the
structure and all the known forces acting on it.

00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:32.680
Consider, for example, a bridge.

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.540
The material the bridge is made of contributes
to its weight.

00:04:35.540 --> 00:04:39.220
Rather than show the force of gravity
acting on all the little bits of the bridge,

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.420
you can average all the contributions of its mass
and draw a single force on the diagram acting on
what’s called the center of mass.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:51.040
Now, say there was a goat trying to cross
the bridge, maybe to get to some greener grass
on a hillside.

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:53.860
Luckily for the goat, there’s
no troll blocking its way.

00:04:53.860 --> 00:04:58.900
Since the bridge is in equilibrium and both
the goat’s weight and the bridge’s own weight
are pulling it down,

00:04:58.900 --> 00:05:03.300
there must be some force counteracting this to
stop the bridge from dropping into the river.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:10.780
In this case, you would use static equilibrium
to calculate the force each of the supports have
to apply to the bridge to hold it up.

00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:13.560
The details require a bit of math and
careful thinking.

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.420
But the basic idea is, if you add the contributions
of all the forces in each direction,

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:24.240
being careful to give opposing forces different
signs in your equations, everything should balance
out to zero.

00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:32.240
So at a glance, you already know that the sum of all the
forces acting upward, from the supports of the bridge,
has to cancel out the downward forces of the weights.

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.780
The full treatment would require a bit more
work, of course.

00:05:34.780 --> 00:05:42.440
If it was a suspension bridge, the weight of the
bridge and the goat would be counteracted by the
vertical component of the tension in the cables.

00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:46.100
If those cables can only handle a certain
amount of tension before breaking,

00:05:46.100 --> 00:05:51.200
a free body diagram could help you work out
the total weight the bridge could handle before
the cables snap.

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:56.880
It’s also important to consider the torque –
any force that could cause a rotation of an
object around a point.

00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.700
It’s also sometimes called a moment.

00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:04.500
Torque is usually a factor when part of a
structure is fixed to some point, about which
it’s free to rotate, called a pivot.

00:06:04.500 --> 00:06:08.340
If you’ve ever been to a playground, you
might have seen torques in action on a seesaw.

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.780
Let’s say there are two twins with the same
weight, Parvati and Padma.

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:15.620
Both twins sit on a seesaw, one and a half
meters away from the pivot.

00:06:15.620 --> 00:06:22.080
They both weigh six hundred newtons – the
equivalent of about 61 kilograms of mass being
pulled down by gravity.

00:06:22.080 --> 00:06:26.740
They’re exerting torque because on their
own, each twin would cause the seesaw to rotate.

00:06:26.740 --> 00:06:33.340
The torque comes from the force of the twin’s
weight pushing down on the seesaw, perpendicular
to the line connecting the seat to the pivot.

00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:37.400
The heavier the twin, the more force they’ll
exert and the stronger the torque will be.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:39.440
Their distance from the pivot matters too.

00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:44.400
If Parvati moved closer, she’d exert less
torque than Padma and the seesaw would
swing her upward.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:47.580
Those are the two ingredients you need for
calculating torques –

00:06:47.580 --> 00:06:52.840
the force perpendicular to a line connecting to
the pivot, and the distance from the force to the pivot.

00:06:52.840 --> 00:06:59.360
Multiply those together, and you get torque,
which is measured in units of Newton-meters since
you’re multiplying a force by a distance.

00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:06.960
As with forces, in a statics scenario – like the twins
balanced on the seesaw – you can use the fact that
everything balances out to zero to help you.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:13.440
If you add up the torques, defining either
clockwise or counterclockwise as the positive
torque direction, they’ll equal zero.

00:07:13.440 --> 00:07:19.740
In this case, Parvati and Padma each create
torques of nine hundred Newton-meters in opposite
directions, which cancel out.

00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.920
Of course, if Padma swaps places with a heavier
friend of hers, the torques will no longer add up to zero.

00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:31.280
If the seesaw was long enough, she could balance
out the torque generated by her heavier friend
by sitting further away from the pivot.

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:36.900
But if they’re sitting the same distance
away on opposite sides, we have a dynamics
problem, rather than statics.

00:07:36.900 --> 00:07:46.420
By adding up torques or forces, we could work out the total torque and Parvati’s change in angular momentum – or the momentum of her rotation – as she begins to swing upward.

00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:51.679
So dynamics describes when the net force or
torques on the system don’t cancel out.

00:07:51.680 --> 00:07:57.460
That was the problem for the Citicorp building
– the force of the wind had a significant
chance of overwhelming it.

00:07:57.460 --> 00:08:02.780
Big skyscrapers ordinarily resist the wind
through a system of braces inside the building’s
structure.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:09.940
As we’ve seen for the other engineering materials,
the braces can withstand a certain amount of stress
before they begin to undergo failure.

00:08:09.940 --> 00:08:16.500
In the case of the Citicorp building, the
student’s discovery prompted the lead structural
engineer to consider the quartering winds.

00:08:16.500 --> 00:08:23.180
He realized that the positioning of the building’s
support columns meant the total wind force on the
braces would be way more than they’d planned for.

00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:30.480
By looking at how the force of weight was distributed
throughout the building and calculating how quartering
winds would distribute a force to the braces,

00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:36.740
he found that some of the braces would
encounter a tension of 160% more than
they’d previously calculated!

00:08:36.740 --> 00:08:40.020
It would only take a once-in-16-year storm
for the braces to fail!

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.200
Thankfully, he and a team of engineers worked
through the full mechanics of the situation

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:50.080
and realized that they could reinforce the
braces by welding 5-centimeter-thick steel
plates throughout the structure.

00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:59.120
To get the job done without causing too much panic to the inhabitants of the building – or alerting the media – welders worked at night, and in secret to reinforce the braces.

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:08.800
After a few months of welding, they transformed the Citicorp building from having a 1-in-16 chance of failure in any given year, to one of the safest buildings ever built.

00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:11.860
Today, it can handle pretty much anything
the weather throws at it.

00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:16.620
In this episode, we looked at statics and
dynamics, and what they mean for the
structures we design.

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:23.680
We explored the idea of static equilibrium, forces,
and torques, and how free-body diagrams can help
us make sense of it all.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:27.950
In our next episode, we switch from looking
at the math engineers use to solve problems,

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:32.029
to the decisions they have to make to acknowledge
and admit problems in the first place.
