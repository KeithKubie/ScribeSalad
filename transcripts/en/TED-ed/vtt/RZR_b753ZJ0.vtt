00:00:11.768 --> 00:00:14.678
In this short video,
we're going to show you how we constructed

00:00:14.678 --> 00:00:19.482
and animated a pop-up book 
to explain Earth's tectonic plates.

00:00:19.482 --> 00:00:23.587
The supercontinent Pangaea
broke apart 200,000,000 years ago,

00:00:23.587 --> 00:00:26.155
but the pieces haven't stopped shifting.

00:00:26.155 --> 00:00:29.557
Although with animation we can show
this movement easily with drawings,

00:00:29.557 --> 00:00:34.088
we thought it'd be more interesting
to depict gigantic sliding slabs of rock

00:00:34.088 --> 00:00:37.992
using a tangible object
that also moves and shifts.

00:00:37.992 --> 00:00:40.248
and the pop-up book idea was born.

00:00:40.248 --> 00:00:44.194
(music)

00:00:44.194 --> 00:00:47.852
To make your own pop-up book,
you'll need some basic paper tools,

00:00:47.852 --> 00:00:52.894
such as scissors, an X-Acto knife, glue,
double-sided Scotch tape, a ruler,

00:00:52.894 --> 00:00:58.047
a bone folder or other creasing tool,
and, of course, some paper.

00:00:58.047 --> 00:01:01.195
For this lesson, 
we first determined the visual style

00:01:01.195 --> 00:01:03.650
by making illustrations and 
deciding on the overall

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:09.482
design, colors, shapes and elements
we wanted on each page, or spread.

00:01:09.482 --> 00:01:13.333
You can have more detailed illustrations,
but we wanted to illustrate this lesson

00:01:13.333 --> 00:01:16.504
simply by playing with shapes and colors.

00:01:16.504 --> 00:01:19.217
When you visualize your pop-up
and choose a visual style,

00:01:19.217 --> 00:01:22.884
you will want to make a bunch of
good old pencil sketches on paper

00:01:22.884 --> 00:01:25.789
and plan each movement for each spread.

00:01:25.789 --> 00:01:27.404
Plan as much as you can:

00:01:27.404 --> 00:01:31.534
all the basic shapes and how they connect
and how you want them to move,

00:01:31.534 --> 00:01:33.728
which parts you want to pop-up first.

00:01:33.728 --> 00:01:34.955
Challenge yourself,

00:01:34.955 --> 00:01:40.445
and explore multiple possibilities of how your 
main element on the spread can pop up.

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:42.684
For the next step,
make a mock-up spread

00:01:42.684 --> 00:01:45.373
and see if your masterful 
paper engineering ideas

00:01:45.373 --> 00:01:48.523
translate from a sketch
to the actual prototype.

00:01:48.523 --> 00:01:51.603
Instead of using fancy paper,
start with the cheap stuff

00:01:51.603 --> 00:01:54.648
and allow yourself to make 
mistakes and adjustments.

00:01:54.648 --> 00:01:59.074
This prototype lets you see
how your preliminary sketches will come to life.

00:01:59.074 --> 00:02:03.608
You will want to first draw
all individual parts on a single sheet,

00:02:03.608 --> 00:02:08.388
including all your main pieces,
all the supporting pieces and the folds.

00:02:08.388 --> 00:02:11.632
You may be surprised 
that there are only two types of folds

00:02:11.632 --> 00:02:14.443
that can make your elements pop up
the way you want:

00:02:14.443 --> 00:02:20.139
a step fold and a V-fold.

00:02:20.139 --> 00:02:22.090
Here, you can see how we
used a step fold

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.897
to make each layer
of the Earth step out.

00:02:25.897 --> 00:02:29.480
Then, cut all your individual elements
and assemble using glue

00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:31.675
or double-sided Scotch tape.

00:02:31.675 --> 00:03:05.505
(Music)

00:03:05.505 --> 00:03:07.068
Through trial and error,
make sure that all

00:03:07.068 --> 00:03:10.970
the elements, shapes and placements
are moving the way you imagined,

00:03:10.970 --> 00:03:14.473
and that they fold properly 
when closed and opened.

00:03:14.473 --> 00:03:27.301
(Music)

00:03:27.301 --> 00:03:29.481
Once your prototype is tested
and complete,

00:03:29.481 --> 00:03:32.756
you can proceed to making the final
product in color.

00:03:32.756 --> 00:03:36.335
Draw or paint on your main pop-up
elements as you see fit.

00:03:36.335 --> 00:03:36.963
For this lesson,

00:03:36.963 --> 00:03:40.611
we decided to just play with simple shapes
in different colors

00:03:40.611 --> 00:03:43.661
to create the world of shifting
continents we imagined.

00:03:43.661 --> 00:04:47.583
(Music)

00:04:47.583 --> 00:04:50.538
When we were planning each spread,
we knew we wanted some elements

00:04:50.538 --> 00:04:53.521
to move independently 
of the typical pop-up book

00:04:53.521 --> 00:04:56.598
using slight manipulations and animations.

00:04:56.598 --> 00:04:59.603
We had to plan well,
but also use a few tricks.

00:04:59.603 --> 00:05:01.865
As always, when you're making 
stop-motion,

00:05:01.865 --> 00:05:06.187
you may have to be creative and
use all sorts of unusual tools and props

00:05:06.187 --> 00:05:08.920
to achieve the effect that you want.

00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.221
In this shot, the birds had to fly
across and off the edge of the book,

00:05:13.221 --> 00:05:16.810
so we used Fun-Tak to move
the clouds across the page.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:19.431
Once they left the page,
they had to be trimmed

00:05:19.431 --> 00:05:22.313
to get the illusion they flew off.

00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:24.454
When the pages of the book
close at the end,

00:05:24.454 --> 00:05:27.935
we had to flip each page,
supporting it in each position

00:05:27.935 --> 00:05:31.150
long enough to be photographed
as an individual frame.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.171
We used binder clips,
wedges, Fun-Tak,

00:05:34.171 --> 00:05:37.286
and almost every handy
little thing you can think of.

00:05:37.286 --> 00:05:39.821
Once all the individual frames
were photographed,

00:05:39.821 --> 00:05:42.147
we put them all together
and composited

00:05:42.147 --> 00:05:45.446
to make our pop-up book
look like it's moving on its own.

00:05:45.446 --> 00:05:47.027
So now, think of a special occasion

00:05:47.027 --> 00:05:50.468
where you can surprise someone
with your own unique pop-up card,

00:05:50.468 --> 00:05:52.844
or an entire story that you want to tell,

00:05:52.844 --> 00:05:56.438
and start plotting the ins and outs
of your pop-up book.
