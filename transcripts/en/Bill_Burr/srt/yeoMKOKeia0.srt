1
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:03,560
Hey, what's going on?

2
00:00:03,561 --> 00:00:06,500
It's Bill Burr and It's time for the
Monday morning podcast for Monday,

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:11,780
May 15th, 2017 halfway
through the month of May.

4
00:00:11,781 --> 00:00:14,030
Oh Jesus Christ.

5
00:00:14,900 --> 00:00:19,900
Do you know Bobby or scored that fucking
overtime goal on mother's Day to win

6
00:00:20,331 --> 00:00:25,130
the Stanley Cup back then? You know,
I think you only had to win eight.

7
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:31,100
It was like fucking 12 teams. He had
the original six and the expansion six,

8
00:00:31,101 --> 00:00:33,230
the original six really
weren't the original six.

9
00:00:33,231 --> 00:00:36,890
They would just to six leftover after
fuck in the stock market crash or some

10
00:00:36,891 --> 00:00:41,300
shit. They were the only guys
left or after World War One.

11
00:00:42,020 --> 00:00:44,960
I can't remember. Didn't
like the Lusitania sink.

12
00:00:44,961 --> 00:00:48,410
And then that like half the players on
them fucking Montreal maroons were on it.

13
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,960
I don't know. What does his stump
the fucking shwarmy over here.

14
00:00:53,750 --> 00:00:58,700
You don't? He has been been,
uh, she's been recording um,

15
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,200
the sports jeopardy, Aka
Buffalo wild wings. Jeopardy.

16
00:01:08,030 --> 00:01:10,910
I would tell you, even as a sports
fan, it's not easy, but, oh,

17
00:01:10,911 --> 00:01:15,200
do I seem like a smarty when I'm watching
that show to the point, Nia goes,

18
00:01:15,201 --> 00:01:19,310
if they ever do any sort of
fucking, you know, comedian,

19
00:01:20,630 --> 00:01:24,800
uh, sports jeopardy thing where you
can give the money to a charity.

20
00:01:24,801 --> 00:01:25,730
I love that shit.

21
00:01:25,850 --> 00:01:30,230
It's like I'm going to go
on TV onto a game show,

22
00:01:30,260 --> 00:01:32,390
one of the hardest game
shows out there. Jeopardy.

23
00:01:32,391 --> 00:01:35,570
Granted it's all going to be about
sports, but they do a lot of shit of like,

24
00:01:35,571 --> 00:01:37,220
you know, you know,

25
00:01:37,221 --> 00:01:41,150
who was the first free agent to
fucking get new a fight with Al Davis,

26
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:43,070
Amsterdam. I don't fucking know. Right.

27
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,210
I'm named the last three
owners of the Seattle Seahawks.

28
00:01:47,211 --> 00:01:50,900
Like they take it to that
level, you know what I mean? Um,

29
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,380
but I love how you know, you, me, he was
like, oh, you should go on then just,

30
00:01:54,381 --> 00:01:58,460
you know, give the money to
a charity. Fuck the charity.

31
00:01:58,461 --> 00:01:59,930
I do enough benefits as a comedian.

32
00:01:59,931 --> 00:02:02,120
I can't go on TV and try
to win some money from me.

33
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:03,990
Okay.

34
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,800
You know, hit a couple of categories,
sitting there going, well, you know,

35
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,630
I'm going to go on TV and expose

36
00:02:14,190 --> 00:02:18,870
how limited my fucking,
I don't know my world is,

37
00:02:18,871 --> 00:02:19,704
I don't know.

38
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,780
I'm going to go on TV and make an ass
of myself and then give it to some dirty

39
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:28,390
face kid afterwards. I'm gonna lose.

40
00:02:28,950 --> 00:02:31,920
And then what some kid who grew up in
a fucking chimney is going to sit there

41
00:02:31,921 --> 00:02:36,030
crying cause I went there and basically
did the babe Ruth thing, a kid.

42
00:02:36,031 --> 00:02:37,980
I'll go out there and hit
a home run for you today,

43
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:41,100
except I'll do it with my mind man.

44
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:46,970
And I'm going to go out there and I'm
going to fucking lose cause they're gonna

45
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:48,660
be like, ah. Yeah.

46
00:02:48,661 --> 00:02:52,410
What brand of baseball glove did goose
Gossett's use when he was still on the

47
00:02:52,411 --> 00:02:57,120
fucking Oakland ace? A
Rawlings? Oh no, sorry.

48
00:02:57,121 --> 00:02:59,010
The correct answer was a Wilson

49
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:06,900
douchebag family with the chance
to steal. Um, I actually did, uh,

50
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,300
you know, if I can remember the category,

51
00:03:09,301 --> 00:03:11,550
my problem with those
shows is sometimes like,

52
00:03:11,551 --> 00:03:16,470
I don't understand the, uh, you know,

53
00:03:16,471 --> 00:03:19,950
they'll say like get Carter and it takes
like me for like fucking three in a row

54
00:03:19,951 --> 00:03:23,130
to understand like, oh, these are,
everybody's got the last thing. Carter,

55
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:26,340
I got the hardest one too.
Or maybe I'm just the oldest.

56
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:28,530
They brought up the fucking,

57
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,680
the dude on Michigan who then I
think went to the fucking USFL.

58
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:34,770
I'm like this fucking
Anthony Carter number one

59
00:03:36,270 --> 00:03:37,770
first started watching college football.

60
00:03:37,771 --> 00:03:41,250
He was demand out there with
the wolverines. All right.

61
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:44,200
Popped bar, Bar bar,
Bar, Bar, Bar, Bar bar.

62
00:03:44,470 --> 00:03:47,640
That doesn't look great. Fucking fight
songs of all time to Michigan world.

63
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:48,310
Lorene's yeah.

64
00:03:48,310 --> 00:03:52,470
That uh, that uh, that uh,
that uh, that Duh, I'm fine.

65
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:54,570
Go with you. I know why.

66
00:03:54,571 --> 00:03:59,571
What goes hail to factors value and
I was singing the Notre Dame song.

67
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:05,010
Oh, Jesus is tank Milo Jay.
Sheesh. They go on foot.

68
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:09,120
Two point conversion there. Jesus,
what do you got to say? Well, you know,

69
00:04:09,121 --> 00:04:12,190
I mean, if they make it, they make
it. I mean, I love everything buddy.

70
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,460
Get out of this fucking locker room. You
Baird it hippie. That's what happened.

71
00:04:16,461 --> 00:04:17,570
If Jesus came back,

72
00:04:18,830 --> 00:04:23,000
Jesus ever went to the locker room
and Newt Rockne was in there, right?

73
00:04:24,200 --> 00:04:27,200
Oh, five foot, nothing of them
considered fucking average height.

74
00:04:27,230 --> 00:04:31,400
Way Back in the day before they put the
horse tranquilizers in the fucking horse

75
00:04:31,401 --> 00:04:35,780
meat that they fed to the horses that
they then fed to the cows. Right.

76
00:04:36,290 --> 00:04:37,880
That then in my burger.

77
00:04:39,130 --> 00:04:39,300
Okay,

78
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:42,150
maybe that's why I have
such a fucking disposition.

79
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:44,400
I eat a lot of red meat.

80
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:45,740
Okay.

81
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:50,600
This is how much red meat I eat. I don't
consider hamburger red meat. To me,

82
00:04:50,601 --> 00:04:53,590
red meat is, I had a steak.
I have a burger man. It's,

83
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:57,950
it's a, it's not, it's not red.
After I'm done cooking it, you know?

84
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:01,640
Actually it's not even true.
I like, I like all of it.

85
00:05:01,641 --> 00:05:06,230
Medium rare and what I've been told by
a life freaks where they're like, look,

86
00:05:06,231 --> 00:05:08,240
you can have a steak medium rare.

87
00:05:08,270 --> 00:05:13,040
That's a lot less of a risk because
that's just one cap. You know,

88
00:05:13,470 --> 00:05:17,510
you rolling the dice, it's like your
bang one hooker without wearing a glove,

89
00:05:17,580 --> 00:05:20,840
a Chase's bill. Right.
And then hamburger though,

90
00:05:20,900 --> 00:05:24,740
it's like you bank
Vietnam. I don't know. Oh,

91
00:05:24,741 --> 00:05:29,530
I picked Vietnam some reason I went to
fucking full metal jacket. Hey Baby,

92
00:05:29,531 --> 00:05:31,300
you got go from Vietnam.

93
00:05:31,540 --> 00:05:35,620
It's like you banged a
fucking country or that,

94
00:05:35,621 --> 00:05:36,640
that's what hamburger is.

95
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,630
Cause it's just a bunch of cows
all fucking mulch together. Right.

96
00:05:40,870 --> 00:05:44,290
You have a stake. It's like you just
fucked one cow. That's what I'm trying to,

97
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:46,720
or steer I should say. What's the stair?

98
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,340
Well that's a bow without
his balls buddy. All right.

99
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:54,490
And take off it's fucking horns.
Um, I don't know what it is anyways.

100
00:05:54,520 --> 00:05:59,150
And if you have hamburger
that's like, you know, you know,

101
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,210
you're just Freddie mercury running
around fucking the whole free world.

102
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,840
Isn't that basically it? I mean,
I'm not, you know, I'm not,

103
00:06:05,841 --> 00:06:09,140
I don't know my way around the kitchen
enough to s to know if that analogy

104
00:06:09,141 --> 00:06:12,520
worked or not. But, uh, I will say that I,

105
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:17,300
let's just get back to the original
point. Okay. What was the original point?

106
00:06:17,301 --> 00:06:17,421
Yeah.

107
00:06:17,421 --> 00:06:22,421
I don't consider hamburger red meat or
was it that I'm not giving some fucking

108
00:06:22,491 --> 00:06:25,520
kid who lives in a chimney. I don't
know why. A chimney, you know,

109
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:30,860
you know what, seeing broke children
is always sad unless they're white.

110
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,290
This just something fucking
funny. But yet, you know,

111
00:06:33,890 --> 00:06:36,950
I think it's just a relief as a white
person that the guilt goes away.

112
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,610
You don't know. You know, anytime you
see somebody from another race broke,

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,600
you know, white people fucking pushed
him out. They put a Walmart down, right?

114
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:46,100
They put one of those, Derek's in there.

115
00:06:46,101 --> 00:06:49,820
They started sucking all the
fucking shit out of it. You know,

116
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,520
I wonder if people around the world
when they watched the beginning of the

117
00:06:52,521 --> 00:06:57,110
Beverly hillbillies start crying. You
know, when they just see the white man,

118
00:06:57,111 --> 00:06:59,930
even though the first they laugh
like, oh my God, it's toothless,

119
00:06:59,931 --> 00:07:03,890
broke white people hilarious. And even
they discover oil and they get to keep it

120
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,060
solely loaded up. The drunk
animal, the Beverly Hills. That is

121
00:07:12,790 --> 00:07:17,720
um, I wonder if they cry
when the children cry.

122
00:07:17,721 --> 00:07:22,130
You know, nobody gets to movie. I
was talking about, I kept references.

123
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:24,650
We had problems with
defeat and we baggy shit.

124
00:07:25,470 --> 00:07:26,303
Yeah.

125
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:31,370
Um, anyway, so let's apply. Speaking of
that, children cry. That's white line.

126
00:07:31,371 --> 00:07:35,570
Everybody when the children
cry was actually a hit.

127
00:07:35,750 --> 00:07:39,320
That's how fucking off the
rails music went at one point.

128
00:07:39,790 --> 00:07:40,623
Okay.

129
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:43,533
Little Chat

130
00:07:45,500 --> 00:07:50,260
[inaudible] I was like on the
top 10. I remember watching it.

131
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:52,270
I didn't give a fuck about that song,

132
00:07:52,271 --> 00:07:57,010
but I was like that lead guitar instead
of all these fucking guys trying to be

133
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:57,850
Eddie van Halen.

134
00:07:57,860 --> 00:08:00,730
Am I saying this guy was there
trying to do the shit that Eddie did?

135
00:08:00,731 --> 00:08:04,030
That fucking guy in white line.
He came the closest, you know,

136
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,950
out of all the white bands, you
know the white lions, the fucking,

137
00:08:09,150 --> 00:08:12,130
who else was it? A, it was
white Lion Jews. Great White.

138
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:16,930
It was white snake. It was eight Aye.

139
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:19,210
It was a little known all white funk band.

140
00:08:20,670 --> 00:08:22,030
Cause then what people used
to yell when they want to say,

141
00:08:22,031 --> 00:08:26,380
I can't remember how it goes. I Dunno.
Um, anyways, speaking of children crying,

142
00:08:27,700 --> 00:08:31,180
my condolences to, uh,

143
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,090
all the fans of the Washington capitals.

144
00:08:35,050 --> 00:08:38,080
And you know what happens when you hit
the fucking wall for the third time when

145
00:08:38,081 --> 00:08:42,940
you win the president's trophy, you
know, under two different presidents.

146
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:46,600
Okay. When Obama brings you to,

147
00:08:46,900 --> 00:08:49,900
and Donald Trump comes in with
his tie hanging all the way down,

148
00:08:50,050 --> 00:08:52,720
his tie would still touch the ground.
Even if he was wearing skates.

149
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:57,840
He comes walking in the locker room
and he gives you that fucking trophy.

150
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,680
You're right, you're on
your second damn president.

151
00:09:03,210 --> 00:09:06,900
You've left the ugliest uniforms in the
history of the fucking game of hockey,

152
00:09:06,901 --> 00:09:09,150
possibly. Definitely up there.

153
00:09:10,440 --> 00:09:14,520
Those blue ones with that
gold fucking eagle, you know,

154
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,510
it just looks like they
put a stamp, like the,

155
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:20,100
like the post office had a
limited stamp thing, you know?

156
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:25,830
Then all those weird fucking smelly
people, you know, people who don't bathe,

157
00:09:25,831 --> 00:09:30,570
collect stamps, you know, and
I'm not saying that, you know,

158
00:09:31,530 --> 00:09:35,400
with all this stuff, like what do you
identify with a man or a woman, you know,

159
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,320
being a man, I don't, I, I'm a
man, but I don't identify as,

160
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,400
don't identify where he imagined the
fucking emptiness of that every day.

161
00:09:44,400 --> 00:09:46,710
Waking Up, shave and going,
what the fuck is this?

162
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,640
I can't relate to this
fucking beard on my face, man.

163
00:09:52,050 --> 00:09:56,730
You know, when am I, Ted's going to
come in. I just, I can't imagine that.

164
00:09:56,731 --> 00:09:59,270
But whenever there's other
people that can't, you know,

165
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:02,610
they don't identify with other
human beings, forget about,

166
00:10:02,611 --> 00:10:04,830
they don't identify with their own gender.

167
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:08,190
There's another group of people that
we all need to care about and wear a

168
00:10:08,191 --> 00:10:10,800
certain color on a certain
day or maybe a ribbon for,

169
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:14,610
and these are people that can
identify with other people.

170
00:10:15,450 --> 00:10:18,000
They just can't identify
with human beings in general.

171
00:10:18,030 --> 00:10:22,650
And these people collect stamps, you
know, they just sit in their room.

172
00:10:22,651 --> 00:10:23,970
They're not bothering anybody.

173
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,820
Taking that big giant fucking
book off that shelf, you know,

174
00:10:29,821 --> 00:10:31,170
blowing the dust off it.

175
00:10:32,280 --> 00:10:36,750
Cause they finally got the Washington
Capitols fucking horrific Jersey from the

176
00:10:36,751 --> 00:10:40,170
mid to early two thousands whenever
they had that. It was that awful period.

177
00:10:40,171 --> 00:10:41,640
That's why in the NHL,

178
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:47,310
the added too many fucking teams and
everybody changed their uniforms.

179
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:53,280
I should put it all on the capitalist,
Washington DC. Fucking horrific.

180
00:10:53,670 --> 00:10:57,750
Thank God they went back to the red,
white and blue. You know, I mean,

181
00:10:57,751 --> 00:10:59,880
you are there in DC for
fuck sakes. You know,

182
00:10:59,910 --> 00:11:02,670
if anybody shoved the color of
the flag, you should be you guys.

183
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,640
You know the Buffalo Sabers,

184
00:11:06,690 --> 00:11:10,470
that fucking IHL horseshit
they had, you know,

185
00:11:10,710 --> 00:11:13,050
where they put a sheep on the front
of even was like a bull anymore.

186
00:11:13,140 --> 00:11:16,830
It was terrible. Fucking terrible. Um,

187
00:11:17,550 --> 00:11:18,860
props to them. By the way, when they,

188
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:20,660
they finally admitted that
they made a fucking mess.

189
00:11:20,790 --> 00:11:23,690
That was such a horrible period.
They had that strike that.

190
00:11:23,691 --> 00:11:27,600
They lost a whole season
of the NHL. All right.

191
00:11:27,630 --> 00:11:31,680
They added a bunch of fucking
teams. Too many goddamn teams.

192
00:11:32,760 --> 00:11:37,320
They had the Atlanta thrashers, they
had the fucking Florida Marlins, right?

193
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:40,470
That's right. They played hockey first
before. They suck so bad. They were like,

194
00:11:40,471 --> 00:11:44,310
you know what? Let's just fucking play
baseball now. If the Florida panthers,

195
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:48,180
the lightning, the coyotes,

196
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:52,380
and I think the north stars
moved down to become the stars,

197
00:11:52,381 --> 00:11:54,190
at least they kept the kind
of the there are right,

198
00:11:54,191 --> 00:11:57,370
cause they kept the same fucking uniforms.

199
00:11:57,470 --> 00:12:00,340
Then of course they knocked down that
stadium in Minnesota and they put up the

200
00:12:00,341 --> 00:12:01,600
mall of America there.

201
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:07,750
But it's so sad that you know the place
would dino Sorelli smashed a stick over

202
00:12:07,751 --> 00:12:08,710
that fucking guy's head.

203
00:12:08,711 --> 00:12:12,670
You can now sit there standing there
eating frozen yogurt without a care in the

204
00:12:12,671 --> 00:12:16,780
world, you know? Or did what?

205
00:12:16,781 --> 00:12:21,730
Was that a road game anyways? Um,

206
00:12:23,160 --> 00:12:24,700
fuck am I talking about
here? That's right.

207
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:27,820
So then you had all these new teams
in the NHL and then on top of that,

208
00:12:28,030 --> 00:12:32,890
all these teams that had been established
all changed their fucking uniforms.

209
00:12:34,030 --> 00:12:37,270
So you, you, you come back after the
strike and you just watching like, dude,

210
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:41,020
is this the fucking Olympics? Well
actually that's not true cause that,

211
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,920
or they started doing that in
the 90s because when the Sabres,

212
00:12:44,950 --> 00:12:48,340
the Sabres got fun in 1999,

213
00:12:49,630 --> 00:12:52,410
you know, back when you could
even have a fucking shoelace.

214
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,710
Tough like fucking shoe leather. That
mood Sarell Huh? Who knows that one?

215
00:12:56,740 --> 00:13:00,460
There's another obscure tough
like fucking shoe leather,

216
00:13:00,910 --> 00:13:05,500
that Mozzarella, Mozzarella, whatever
the fuck you said Mozzarella. Huh?

217
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:10,420
Who knows that one? If you're religious,
you might know that. That's a hint.

218
00:13:11,020 --> 00:13:12,940
The title has something religious.

219
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:16,840
Every religious figure in it and
it's not Jesus Christ superstar.

220
00:13:16,841 --> 00:13:20,500
That's the last hint I'm
going to give you. Um, yeah,

221
00:13:20,501 --> 00:13:25,480
the savers got fucking 1999. Was
it Brett Hall? Was it fucking,

222
00:13:25,870 --> 00:13:29,100
uh, uh, Danny Mashburn? I
don't know who the fuck was.

223
00:13:29,110 --> 00:13:31,780
Joe B Joe Barry Carroll who had
that foot in the fucking crease.

224
00:13:31,781 --> 00:13:32,411
I can't remember.

225
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:35,410
But the whole year they're calling it
until the biggest goal of the year.

226
00:13:35,411 --> 00:13:39,460
The one that decides to Stanley Cup
Classic NHL. Yeah, that new rule.

227
00:13:39,461 --> 00:13:42,310
That's been fucking everybody
all year round. Yeah, forget it.

228
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:47,640
We've decided to change the rule and
over time in the clinching game of the

229
00:13:48,431 --> 00:13:51,910
Stanley Cup playoffs, that's
how we do it. That's right.

230
00:13:52,840 --> 00:13:55,800
That's how we do it. We take
breaks every 20 minutes and a,

231
00:13:55,810 --> 00:13:58,540
we have rules that all of a sudden
the rules go away. So anyways,

232
00:13:58,780 --> 00:14:00,370
my condolences to the city,

233
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:05,320
to the district of Columbia capital
fans, man, they fucking did it.

234
00:14:05,321 --> 00:14:09,590
T again. You know, when you keep
showing up cause you real fans,

235
00:14:09,620 --> 00:14:10,301
you know what's going to suck.

236
00:14:10,301 --> 00:14:12,190
Now they're going to dismantle
the entire fucking team.

237
00:14:12,340 --> 00:14:15,430
Hopefully they keep a veggie skin. You
guys are out of your fucking minds.

238
00:14:15,431 --> 00:14:18,550
If you get rid of him, are they
going to blame it all on him?

239
00:14:18,551 --> 00:14:23,020
Did you see that picture of his
leg? I'll fucking bruised up.

240
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,010
He looked like somebody
tried to get information out
of him and he wouldn't give

241
00:14:27,011 --> 00:14:31,510
it up, you know, fucking
vein sticking out.

242
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:35,950
Um, uh, my daughter's crying
in there. Oh Jesus Christ.

243
00:14:36,960 --> 00:14:40,060
And I feel like a bad dad, but he is
in there. Okay. He is handling it.

244
00:14:40,450 --> 00:14:44,380
Don't worry. Can you hear that? Yeah.

245
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:46,120
This is the time of night.

246
00:14:46,121 --> 00:14:49,750
Like she's so like wants to know
everything that's going on that she does.

247
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:53,330
She won't nap enough during the, and
by the way, fuck all your suggestions.

248
00:14:53,750 --> 00:14:55,100
I don't want to hear
a million suggestions.

249
00:14:55,820 --> 00:14:59,420
Put one of her shirts in in the bath
than that. We've tried everything. Okay.

250
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,283
It's just, you know,

251
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,950
it's a phase she's going through and I
am done listening to fucking people who

252
00:15:06,051 --> 00:15:09,620
are not wearing lab coats and if you don't
have a lab coat on and you don't have

253
00:15:09,621 --> 00:15:12,440
a fucking little degree
hanging on a wall behind you,

254
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:16,040
just keep your fucking
ideas to yourself. Okay.

255
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:22,220
The level of shit that parents talk every
fucking one of them as a Goddamn cure

256
00:15:22,340 --> 00:15:24,050
for every fucking thing that happens.

257
00:15:24,051 --> 00:15:29,000
Every one of them just glided through
fucking being a parent or four figured it

258
00:15:29,001 --> 00:15:33,950
all out and for some stupid reason they
didn't cash in on it and write a book.

259
00:15:34,940 --> 00:15:38,330
Why would you do that when you can just
show up to somebody's house and vomit

260
00:15:38,331 --> 00:15:39,710
all your fucking ideas on a,

261
00:15:41,960 --> 00:15:44,180
if any of your people's
fucking ideas work,

262
00:15:44,510 --> 00:15:47,810
you should put it in a book and go on
the Oprah channel and you guys can sit

263
00:15:47,811 --> 00:15:51,080
there holding each other's fucking hands
and she tells you how amazing you are.

264
00:15:52,190 --> 00:15:55,400
Instead of coming over here, boring
me with it and then I go and try it.

265
00:15:55,430 --> 00:15:59,540
You know? Actually, you know what the
shirt one worked, the shirt one did work.

266
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:00,720
I will say that. I should,

267
00:16:00,740 --> 00:16:05,060
I shouldn't have fucking said that because
a relative suggested to me and it was

268
00:16:05,061 --> 00:16:07,970
fucking great. That's just the
first thing that popped in my head.

269
00:16:08,060 --> 00:16:11,090
I was actually thinking about somebody
else that annoyed the shit out of me with

270
00:16:11,091 --> 00:16:11,924
something else.

271
00:16:12,110 --> 00:16:15,980
I'm trying to feed my kids solid food
three months into her life. Oh no,

272
00:16:15,981 --> 00:16:17,120
it's fine. It's fine.

273
00:16:22,460 --> 00:16:24,170
Oh God. This is, this is
the danger of riffing.

274
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,040
Cause you ended up shitting on the person
you're not upset with. Um, anyways,

275
00:16:28,041 --> 00:16:32,240
plumbing ahead. Uh, where am I? Oh yeah,

276
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,100
the condolences. You know, so I would,

277
00:16:34,101 --> 00:16:37,490
I would definitely keep Ovechkin
you got to build around the guy,

278
00:16:37,750 --> 00:16:40,930
build around the guy again in a, you
know, get a coach with a neck and,

279
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:44,430
you know, you know, maybe he can see
if something was off sides and not,

280
00:16:44,510 --> 00:16:44,721
and he could,

281
00:16:44,721 --> 00:16:48,410
he could throw the flag or whatever you
do to challenge it instead of sitting

282
00:16:48,411 --> 00:16:52,070
there with his, his, his spine fused. Um,

283
00:16:52,071 --> 00:16:56,600
somebody made the joke said that every
coach in the NFL in the NHL looks like a

284
00:16:56,601 --> 00:17:00,740
bond villain. And uh, it is true.

285
00:17:01,610 --> 00:17:04,760
I, I gotta go with that.
You know what I mean? Um,

286
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:09,220
although I would say that closed
Julian closed. Julian looks like that,

287
00:17:09,280 --> 00:17:14,240
that dude in the swamp thing that when
he got turned into a monster became that

288
00:17:14,241 --> 00:17:15,440
little guy running around.

289
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:20,840
That was such a weird fucking movie where,

290
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,330
I don't even remember
the name of the movie.

291
00:17:23,331 --> 00:17:26,200
The whole thing about the movie
was it was this chicken shed,

292
00:17:26,210 --> 00:17:29,600
these giant fucking tits and you're just
waiting for her to go into the lake.

293
00:17:29,601 --> 00:17:32,570
So they'd show a little side boob.
Now, this is the early eighties.

294
00:17:32,571 --> 00:17:37,280
That was a big fucking thing when you
were like 12 years old. All right,

295
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:39,440
so the deal with the swamp thing,

296
00:17:40,820 --> 00:17:44,470
which is where I got that thing I had
broken with the, and we Becky's, that's,

297
00:17:44,660 --> 00:17:48,530
that's where it's from. It's from the
swamping. I'm obviously fucking with you.

298
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:54,030
Um, what am I talking about? Yeah, the
swamp thing. Right. So how that worked.

299
00:17:54,031 --> 00:17:58,080
He was, he was, I forget what headed
the guy was walking near a swamp,

300
00:17:58,081 --> 00:17:59,070
you know the usual thing.

301
00:17:59,070 --> 00:18:01,770
And then a telephone pole
falls into the fucking swamp.

302
00:18:01,771 --> 00:18:05,850
He gets electrocuted and then he becomes
the swamp thing and he's as strong as

303
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,310
shit and there's some fucking bad guy.

304
00:18:08,820 --> 00:18:13,530
So they figure out how he became the
swamp thing. So then the bad guy wants,

305
00:18:14,360 --> 00:18:17,000
he wants a swamp thing, have
him send army a swamp thing.

306
00:18:17,001 --> 00:18:20,420
So whatever you can take over all the
swamps. I don't, I don't remember. Right.

307
00:18:21,050 --> 00:18:25,970
So this fucking little weasel,
he dude, he does the same thing.

308
00:18:26,030 --> 00:18:29,780
And when he turns into a monster, he
says, little as fucking weasely monster.

309
00:18:31,270 --> 00:18:34,030
So then the bad guy goes, well, how
come he didn't turn into what you are?

310
00:18:34,031 --> 00:18:35,110
And it says, well, you know,

311
00:18:35,111 --> 00:18:38,440
when you get electrocuted in the
swamp and you turn into a swamp thing,

312
00:18:38,650 --> 00:18:41,590
it just enhances your
personality. All right?

313
00:18:42,070 --> 00:18:45,430
So if you're a fucking stud like me who
even know I look like a swamp thing,

314
00:18:45,431 --> 00:18:48,860
I could still bang that big tinted
hor over there and the lake. Uh,

315
00:18:48,910 --> 00:18:52,540
if you're a little weaselly con you just
become an ugly weasley con with like

316
00:18:52,541 --> 00:18:56,830
mud and leaves for skin. They
go people and I, you know,

317
00:18:56,831 --> 00:18:59,230
I can't think of a bet. Sorry,
just blew out years there.

318
00:18:59,231 --> 00:19:02,650
I can't think of a better time to
read a little bit of advertising.

319
00:19:02,651 --> 00:19:06,040
What do you say? What do you say
that, what do we got here? Oh wait,

320
00:19:06,090 --> 00:19:10,940
I've got to finish. So you know. Okay,
well I think I can say to DC fans is a,

321
00:19:10,941 --> 00:19:13,760
when you finally fucking went
it, it makes it all the sweeter.

322
00:19:13,761 --> 00:19:15,540
Just going through all
of this shit. All right.

323
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:20,570
I watched the Bruins from about 79 80
and I had to wait til like 2011 so what's

324
00:19:21,111 --> 00:19:21,321
that?

325
00:19:21,321 --> 00:19:26,321
A a nine 99 2009 I watched
him for about 33 years.

326
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:30,650
All right. Um, and I know you guys.

327
00:19:30,690 --> 00:19:35,570
Woo Woo Woo. Oh, shut up. Shut up.

328
00:19:35,630 --> 00:19:38,510
All right. You got all those monuments.
She could fucking walk around Ya.

329
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:42,680
Cheer up. Did look at the window.
The wizits forced the game. Seven.

330
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:46,370
I'll talk about that a little later
after I'd read a couple of fucking

331
00:19:46,371 --> 00:19:51,140
advertisements here. Hell, x
everybody. Helix. You're unique.

332
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:53,630
Oh, you're a special
little fucking content yet.

333
00:19:53,900 --> 00:19:57,940
You don't walk like everyone else.
Talk like everyone else. Sleep shoot,

334
00:19:58,490 --> 00:20:01,680
chariot like anyone else.
So let me ask you this,

335
00:20:01,681 --> 00:20:05,460
why is your mattress one size fits all?

336
00:20:06,180 --> 00:20:09,330
I hate this question. It's just
because there's a general height that

337
00:20:11,220 --> 00:20:15,130
okay, from a little baby all the way up
to like if you make a mattress that fits

338
00:20:15,131 --> 00:20:16,570
somebody about six foot four,

339
00:20:16,780 --> 00:20:20,340
you're covering like babies all
the way to like 90% of adults.

340
00:20:20,410 --> 00:20:24,560
It has to be right. I don't know.
What do I know about mattresses?

341
00:20:25,970 --> 00:20:27,830
About as much as I know
about reading out loud,

342
00:20:27,831 --> 00:20:32,450
but I'm going to continue because a truly
customized mattress will cost you five

343
00:20:32,840 --> 00:20:36,320
to 10,000 bucks until now.

344
00:20:37,550 --> 00:20:38,241
Go to helix,

345
00:20:38,241 --> 00:20:43,241
sleep.com answer a few simple questions
and they'll run a 3d biomechanical model

346
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,960
of your body through the proprietary
algorithms they've developed with the help

347
00:20:49,961 --> 00:20:54,550
of the world's leading
Ergonomic biomechanic experts.

348
00:20:54,850 --> 00:20:58,600
The results of fucking robot
shows up to your front door,

349
00:20:58,660 --> 00:21:01,600
who looks exactly like you with
the mattress strapped to his back,

350
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:05,260
it gives you their old forearm fucking
shiver and next thing you know he's

351
00:21:05,261 --> 00:21:09,760
banging your wife from the
bed that you paid for. Sorry.

352
00:21:10,270 --> 00:21:10,451
No,

353
00:21:10,451 --> 00:21:13,840
what really happens is the
most comfortable mattress
you've ever slept on shows

354
00:21:13,841 --> 00:21:18,610
up, right? You lady lays in it.
She's like, oh my God, this is great,

355
00:21:18,611 --> 00:21:18,941
right?

356
00:21:18,941 --> 00:21:22,840
She reaches over for your fucking Meat
Hammer and next thing you know you need

357
00:21:22,841 --> 00:21:23,860
to buy a new mattress.

358
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,070
He likes customers report a
30% improvement in overall
sleep quality and for

359
00:21:29,891 --> 00:21:34,180
couples. They customize
each side of the mattress.

360
00:21:34,540 --> 00:21:38,040
The beginning of the end
of your marriage, um,

361
00:21:38,050 --> 00:21:40,660
is when you have the custom telling
you that's the beginning end of it.

362
00:21:40,661 --> 00:21:43,270
That starts with that. And
then he goes, you know,

363
00:21:43,271 --> 00:21:45,220
it'd be great if your tits were
a little bit bigger, right?

364
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:49,120
And then she starts redoing herself
like Matt Damon in the Liberace movie.

365
00:21:49,121 --> 00:21:53,410
And then one day just gets rid of her.
And maybe nowadays with millennials,

366
00:21:53,411 --> 00:21:54,730
it probably goes the opposite way.

367
00:21:55,330 --> 00:21:57,910
The way these broads a slap and
the guys around in the shows now,

368
00:21:58,510 --> 00:22:01,870
it's unbelievable hanging them off
of fucking balconies and stuff.

369
00:22:01,871 --> 00:22:05,110
Your mattress arrives at your door in
about a week and shipping is 100% free.

370
00:22:05,111 --> 00:22:10,111
That's why everyone from GQ magazine
to Forbes are all talking about helic

371
00:22:10,741 --> 00:22:13,690
sleep. That's what they're doing.
They're not talking about ties.

372
00:22:14,050 --> 00:22:17,560
They're not talking about the
next hostile takeover, right?

373
00:22:17,680 --> 00:22:21,100
They're talking about mattresses. Do
you have a hundred nights to try it out?

374
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:23,380
And if you don't love it,
they'll pick it up for free,

375
00:22:23,650 --> 00:22:27,790
gross and give you 100%
refund. No questions asked.

380
00:22:48,910 --> 00:22:51,660
[inaudible] me on deeds. His
balls a metal. Don't say that.

381
00:22:52,240 --> 00:22:56,440
Not he walks up the doors,
slammed you in the face.

382
00:22:57,700 --> 00:23:01,150
Fucks your wife. Doesn't
can. No race cars is metal.

383
00:23:01,151 --> 00:23:02,980
Nuts and nice and soft.

384
00:23:03,520 --> 00:23:08,520
And then he lays down on a helix
mattress and banked you sister.

385
00:23:09,070 --> 00:23:12,130
Alright. Elevate your underwear game
to the next level with me on this.

386
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:15,310
You've perfected your wardrobe.
But what about the stuff?

387
00:23:15,311 --> 00:23:19,300
Not everybody gets to see. We're
talking about your junk. Everybody.

388
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:24,280
It's time you braided. You pubes oh
wait, this is the wrong copy. Um,

391

and the last thing you take off? Oh,

392
00:23:37,570 --> 00:23:42,040
it's not your socks. Oh, it's not your
contacts that you fucking drawers.

393
00:23:43,120 --> 00:23:43,953

shit. Mandy's are designed in La.

398
00:24:02,150 --> 00:24:04,160

sourced micro modal, modal,

400
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,760
a fabric three times softer than
cotton. And then you know what?

401
00:24:10,761 --> 00:24:14,100
I believe it now because I haven't, cotton
hasn't said a fucking word about it.

402
00:24:14,270 --> 00:24:17,720
And I've been saying this fee
is Mandy's softer than soft.

His I call it is transparent
for a more precise shave.

430
00:25:44,061 --> 00:25:49,061
It's transparent and visible like the
flames that burned Ricky Bobby helps

00:26:16,881 --> 00:26:17,714

at reading out loud. You know,

442
00:26:32,060 --> 00:26:34,790
watch this. I'm going to say it right now.

443
00:26:34,820 --> 00:26:38,870
I Bet I only make three mistakes in the
next two fucking reads. You want to bet?

444
00:26:39,830 --> 00:26:44,100
What do you want to bet? Huh? You want

445
00:26:44,920 --> 00:26:48,960

of that shit. All right,

446
00:26:48,961 --> 00:26:53,850
policy genius. All right, and I
never said how fast or slow I'd go.

447
00:26:54,090 --> 00:26:58,080
Life Insurance. Do you have it?

448
00:26:58,170 --> 00:27:01,380
See that nailed that first
sentence. If not, why

449
00:27:03,450 --> 00:27:06,750
too expensive or a hassle? Man,

450
00:27:07,110 --> 00:27:08,910
if you don't have life insurance,

451
00:27:09,210 --> 00:27:12,960
what would happen financially if
something happened to the primary earner?

452
00:27:13,920 --> 00:27:17,700
What are you talking to the wife
here? God knows the primary earners.

453
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:20,950
That is the man. And that's not a
sexist statement. I'm just saying I'm,

454
00:27:20,960 --> 00:27:21,450
I'm just,

455
00:27:21,450 --> 00:27:25,350
I'm just a progressive male and I've
listened to all these women bitch moaning

456
00:27:25,351 --> 00:27:29,070
and complaining that we all make
more money to do the exact same job.

457
00:27:29,220 --> 00:27:33,240
But wait a minute, how many women are
plumbers and then marry a plumber?

458
00:27:34,540 --> 00:27:34,870
Okay,

459
00:27:34,870 --> 00:27:39,550
well that'd be the worst of
your own fucking competitive.
Um, both going to bed,

484
00:29:12,900 --> 00:29:16,890
Air. Oh no I don't. That
was the last one. Oh,

485
00:29:16,891 --> 00:29:20,220
this is this guy giving me
shit about airline bumping. Oh,

486
00:29:20,221 --> 00:29:21,540
he fucking went off on me.

487
00:29:22,290 --> 00:29:25,680
He fucking put me in his place when
he sat down in his goddamn keyboard.

I'll get to this in a minute.
I will get to this in a minute.

489
00:29:28,051 --> 00:29:30,870
I like this guy who gives me shit about
the airline bumping. You know why?

490
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:34,890
Because it's very few people out
there that defend the man. All right?

491
00:29:34,950 --> 00:29:37,980
Anybody can attack the
man every once in a while.

492
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:42,430
It takes a fucking a fucking, I
dunno, the Internet version of that.

493
00:29:42,431 --> 00:29:46,960
Clint Eastwood Spaghetti Western guy
coming into town with his little fucking

494
00:29:47,740 --> 00:29:51,480
Mike Tyson's colorful Mike Tyson
towel over his fucking head. Bye.

495
00:29:53,020 --> 00:29:56,110
That's how broke Mike Tyson was when
he was a pony. First started out,

496
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:58,810
he was like, I want to dress like Clint
Eastwood. And they said, all right,

497
00:29:58,811 --> 00:30:03,190
we'll get you his underwear, his boots,
and we'll get that little fucking,

498
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:06,190
that little Sharley
puts over. But you know,

499
00:30:06,191 --> 00:30:10,150
we can't afford to put
any color on it, you know?

500
00:30:10,450 --> 00:30:12,730
And that's the kind of thing that
leads you to bite somebody's ear off.

501
00:30:12,731 --> 00:30:15,520
I'm just saying, I'm not trying
to say that what he did was right,

502
00:30:15,521 --> 00:30:19,330
but I'm just saying I understand. Um, hey,

503
00:30:19,331 --> 00:30:22,660
how you doing up there in Montreal?
Everybody Moray all Canada.

504
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:26,530
How's things going up there?
Enjoying the fucking off season.

505
00:30:26,980 --> 00:30:29,680
God knows you're gonna have enough
time to come and see me in June.

506
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,450
This is what I'm loving about
the predators. All right.

507
00:30:34,451 --> 00:30:37,720
Although they seem like they're
losing right now, I'm taping the game,

508
00:30:37,721 --> 00:30:40,600
but I'll fuck, I'll fuck myself over
here and I'll just look it up right now.

509
00:30:40,660 --> 00:30:41,410
Oh, look at that.

510
00:30:41,410 --> 00:30:44,920
The little time trial thing and
you're going to fucking load for me.

511
00:30:45,100 --> 00:30:47,560
I think the ducks were up
five to two or five to three.

512
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:53,410
How fucking weird are these playoffs
this year? You know? Anyways,

513
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:58,630
now you know, I always give you guys
shit about pet, the curse of Patrick Wa.

514
00:30:58,870 --> 00:31:03,340
You humiliated that guy. I mean, what
you guys did to him when you watch like,

515
00:31:03,780 --> 00:31:08,590
like horror movies, you know what I
mean? When somebody like, you know,

516
00:31:08,650 --> 00:31:12,490
thinks their prom queen and then you'd
dump a bunch of blood on them or they

517
00:31:12,491 --> 00:31:15,700
think that they're going to go make a
wish in a well and then their mother

518
00:31:15,701 --> 00:31:19,220
pushes them to the bottom of it. You
know what I mean? They think they get,

519
00:31:19,221 --> 00:31:24,130
you know that, that all of
that shit, all of that Shit,

520
00:31:24,760 --> 00:31:27,340
right? Somebody drowns in a fucking lake.

521
00:31:27,370 --> 00:31:32,290
You guys did the hockey version
of that to Patrick Wa, you know,

522
00:31:32,740 --> 00:31:35,890
he thought you guys loved them.
They see why there was like Kerry,

523
00:31:35,891 --> 00:31:40,090
he came out there, you know, has one
fucking bad game. You won't pull him.

524
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:44,110
You leave him in there, you
fucking do a mock cheer.

525
00:31:44,111 --> 00:31:46,450
When this guy who redefined the position,

526
00:31:48,340 --> 00:31:49,960
first ballot hall of Famer,

527
00:31:50,170 --> 00:31:54,850
continuing the tradition of winning
fucking Stanley Cups, you know,

528
00:31:54,851 --> 00:31:58,210
and he wanted to earn the real era
when there was like 30 fucking teams,

529
00:31:58,211 --> 00:31:59,230
28 teams,

530
00:32:00,070 --> 00:32:03,190
not all those cups that Canadians and
maple leafs one back in the day when it

531
00:32:03,191 --> 00:32:05,260
wasn't even the state, it was
like a fucking shot glass.

532
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:10,090
It seemed skating around with the
thing. Let's say a fucking baton,

533
00:32:11,590 --> 00:32:16,480
you know, before it became
that giant Goddamn thing. Um,

534
00:32:16,570 --> 00:32:18,760
anyways, they booted him out of town.

535
00:32:18,850 --> 00:32:22,690
So ever since then there's been the
curse of Patrick Wa and I think the next

536
00:32:22,691 --> 00:32:26,860
fucking part in the next
chapter of the curse, okay,

537
00:32:26,861 --> 00:32:29,830
is PK sue. But you know, you know what?

538
00:32:29,831 --> 00:32:32,590
They ran him out of fucking
tee ran that guy at attempt.

539
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:36,490
Now this wasn't your fans. I
think it was the organization.

540
00:32:36,910 --> 00:32:39,040
I also think it's because I'm a Bruins.

541
00:32:39,340 --> 00:32:41,420
I just love giving you guys shit
cause what am I going to do?

542
00:32:41,421 --> 00:32:43,760
Talk about championships. You
guys are going to destroy me.

543
00:32:44,150 --> 00:32:47,180
So this is this little fucking little
thorn I can put in the underneath your

544
00:32:47,181 --> 00:32:51,140
fucking elephant foot
here. All right. What?

545
00:32:51,650 --> 00:32:55,250
PK was a fucking great dude
and he gave too much money.

546
00:32:55,251 --> 00:32:56,470
That children's hospital,

547
00:32:56,510 --> 00:33:00,710
he started becoming bigger than the
Canadians and the Canadians could fucking

548
00:33:00,711 --> 00:33:04,470
handle it. Like when Colby couldn't
handle shack and he said, look,

549
00:33:04,730 --> 00:33:08,330
either he goes awry, go
and they said, okay Colby.

550
00:33:08,450 --> 00:33:12,680
And they sent shack to Miami and then
he went to fucking title there, right.

551
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:17,990
Then they had to bring Phil Jackson back
and another 50,000 fucking free agents

552
00:33:19,070 --> 00:33:20,990
as they always fucking
do. You know, I, you know,

553
00:33:20,991 --> 00:33:23,330
I just give Koby Shit for the
first, the first three rings,

554
00:33:23,331 --> 00:33:25,790
get the Fuck Outta here. The last
two. I'll give you those, you know,

555
00:33:27,020 --> 00:33:29,870
even with the officiating in that
second time you played the Celtics, hey,

556
00:33:29,871 --> 00:33:33,920
let's call fucking 38 files on one
team and 17 on the other. That's,

557
00:33:33,921 --> 00:33:37,610
that makes for a good game. Seven doesn't
it? Not Saying that we would've won,

558
00:33:37,640 --> 00:33:40,250
but it would have been nice to see
the Lakers beat the Celtics that year.

559
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:44,120
Just saying, um, anyways, plowing ahead.

560
00:33:44,121 --> 00:33:48,880
So now the predators are up one to nothing
against the fucking Emilio s Istem as

561
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:53,420
is the Shane's. Whenever the fuck
you call them down there, the mighty,

562
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,620
the mighty Shane's. Okay.

563
00:33:57,080 --> 00:34:01,850
The Anaheim s Devis is the mighty
ducks. I don't like the ducks.

564
00:34:02,540 --> 00:34:07,370
I don't like ducks. Don't give a
fuck. I just don't like them. Okay.

565
00:34:07,520 --> 00:34:11,620
I don't like the Honda
Center. Okay. I you go there,

566
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:16,730
there's no fucking vibe. There's no
vibe in Anaheim. It's just a fucking,

567
00:34:16,731 --> 00:34:20,960
it's just, I don't know what it is.
It's just a strange God damn place.

568
00:34:21,410 --> 00:34:23,030
Anaheim is fucking weird.

569
00:34:25,720 --> 00:34:28,240
It's whole fucking La Aries weird. Like
people weren't supposed to live here.

570
00:34:28,270 --> 00:34:31,480
You know what I mean? They weren't
supposed to fucking live here.

571
00:34:31,481 --> 00:34:33,880
It's a fucking desert. We still water
the whole, the whole thing's weird,

572
00:34:33,881 --> 00:34:37,630
but at least you know this, this
cool shit to look at. You know?

573
00:34:38,080 --> 00:34:41,830
Except when you go to Anaheim, I don't
know what you look at. All right,

574
00:34:41,990 --> 00:34:44,660
and you go down there, there's no
fucking vibe. Maybe it's better.

575
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:47,960
I went to a ducks game in the late
nineties they were still early, right?

576
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:49,040
There was still the mighty ducks.

577
00:34:49,041 --> 00:34:51,380
They still had Donald duck with
the broken bill in the front.

578
00:34:51,381 --> 00:34:56,080
Isn't that what they had for their
logo? I don't know. So anyways, what if,

579
00:34:56,081 --> 00:34:56,710
what if,

580
00:34:56,710 --> 00:35:01,150
what if p k leads the Nashville predators

581
00:35:03,010 --> 00:35:04,720
to a Stanley Cup championship this year?

582
00:35:04,721 --> 00:35:07,570
I'm just throwing that out there for
everybody up there on St Catherine Street.

583
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,420
You know with the acute little pocket
squares that matches the color of your

584
00:35:10,421 --> 00:35:12,220
socks. You know,

585
00:35:13,630 --> 00:35:16,930
what the fuck are you
going to do then Nashville,

586
00:35:16,931 --> 00:35:21,070
that Banjo play in fucking
washboard down by the fucking river.

587
00:35:22,030 --> 00:35:23,200
You haven't been to Nashville.

588
00:35:23,860 --> 00:35:26,800
I mean half the structures
there still have dirt floors.

589
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,280
It's unfuckable. It's ridiculous.

590
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,470
You know like when they went this day,

591
00:35:34,471 --> 00:35:37,770
when they went to Nashville
this year and they were like,

592
00:35:37,771 --> 00:35:40,650
you know who you voting
for for for president,

593
00:35:40,651 --> 00:35:43,530
they allowed like I'll tell you one
thing, I ain't bought Bill Lincoln.

594
00:35:45,880 --> 00:35:50,670
Are you all just afraid slaves?
That's how backward Nashville is.

595
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:53,670
You know? I know there's all this shit
out there saying it's this growing city,

596
00:35:53,780 --> 00:35:55,920
you know, and they're trying
to get people to move there.

597
00:35:55,921 --> 00:35:58,680
The reason why they're trying to do that
is because so many of the structures

598
00:35:58,681 --> 00:36:02,220
still have dirt floors. Okay.
Now if he can go down there,

599
00:36:03,340 --> 00:36:07,920
all right. And, and, and fucking
lead them to the Stanley Cup,

600
00:36:07,921 --> 00:36:09,060
the big boys Stanley Cup,

601
00:36:09,061 --> 00:36:13,320
not that little shot glass that you and
Martin the you and fucking Toronto one

602
00:36:13,321 --> 00:36:18,300
like fucking 15 times each. You know,
I'll give the Canadian say last 10 cups,

603
00:36:18,430 --> 00:36:19,600
but I, I look at him like, Dang,

604
00:36:19,601 --> 00:36:22,350
I can't even say they're equal Detroit
because Detroit was back then when it was

605
00:36:22,351 --> 00:36:26,880
a shock list, you know, sort
of a fancy shot glass. Um,

606
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:30,960
anyways, um, I'm just fucking with you. I,

607
00:36:31,410 --> 00:36:34,560
I've no idea how the fucking
predators are in the finals,

608
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:37,830
the western conference finals with the
ducks and then the Ottawa senators.

609
00:36:37,831 --> 00:36:40,200
What the fuck is going on with
when, when is, when is the,

610
00:36:40,201 --> 00:36:43,020
the glass slip are going to
turn back into a fucking Punkin.

611
00:36:45,230 --> 00:36:48,350
I'm telling you, if Ottawa goes
any deeper into the playoffs,

612
00:36:48,351 --> 00:36:52,120
they're actually going to sell
out a home game. Ms Unbelievable.

613
00:36:52,190 --> 00:36:56,480
Did you see the first game of the
Rangers Beer? 2000 of the Rangers series.

614
00:36:56,481 --> 00:36:59,630
They had 2000 empty seats. That's
because they stopped playing the Bruins.

615
00:37:00,500 --> 00:37:01,333
You know what I mean?

616
00:37:01,730 --> 00:37:05,210
And the Bruins were just close enough to
Ottawa that that shuttle flight wasn't,

617
00:37:05,211 --> 00:37:07,400
it wasn't too expensive, you know,

618
00:37:08,060 --> 00:37:11,750
then they played the rangers
and God knows Rangers, fans,

619
00:37:12,410 --> 00:37:15,770
all those fucking Manhattan cops. They
got the money to fly up to Ottawa.

620
00:37:15,800 --> 00:37:20,780
But then New Yorkers don't. What,
why would I? They got boy's head.

621
00:37:20,840 --> 00:37:24,230
They got a slice of
cheese. Why would I travel?

622
00:37:26,670 --> 00:37:29,130
Look over there and see
empire state building.

623
00:37:31,060 --> 00:37:31,870
Ooh,

624
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:34,240
that's what New Yorkers are.
They, they're, they're fucking,

625
00:37:35,770 --> 00:37:36,910
they're like country people.

626
00:37:37,480 --> 00:37:42,480
You don't have to be low Lee fucking
Skaggs in the fucking five boroughs.

627
00:37:45,540 --> 00:37:45,970
Um,

628
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:49,660
I am in an extra country mood and I am
just trashing people that I have no right

629
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:53,920
to trash. Okay? My team is
not in the playoffs. Okay?

630
00:37:53,921 --> 00:37:57,220
My team has not won as many
championships as the fucking Canadians.

631
00:37:57,460 --> 00:38:01,120
My city doesn't have as many
skyscrapers as New York City.

632
00:38:01,240 --> 00:38:05,240
A don't fuck with my shitty. You
just fucked with the wrong Shetty.

633
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,670
I have problem with Bailey
baggies. If you touch my family,

634
00:38:10,330 --> 00:38:15,100
oh fucking kill you. Those lines
will never get old in Hollywood.

635
00:38:15,820 --> 00:38:17,260
You don't get another fucking hacky thing.

636
00:38:17,261 --> 00:38:22,180
I'm so sick of every other fucking show
doing the speed dating fucking scene.

637
00:38:22,210 --> 00:38:27,210
How many times can you do that and one
fucking lunatic after and maybe it's not

638
00:38:27,641 --> 00:38:28,660
that bad.

639
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:33,990
Jesus fucking Christ people showing up
with like half an ax and that side of

640
00:38:33,991 --> 00:38:36,250
their head. People live with their mother.

641
00:38:36,251 --> 00:38:39,670
The person who's actually gay pretending
to be straight the fucking side.

642
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:40,121
I mean,

643
00:38:40,121 --> 00:38:45,100
Eddie Murphy did this shit fucking
and then coming to America in 1989

644
00:38:47,960 --> 00:38:48,681
Jesus Christ.

645
00:38:48,681 --> 00:38:51,590
Why don't you just have somebody come in
and slip on a banana peel and then get

646
00:38:51,591 --> 00:38:55,910
a pie in their face and then do the dating
thing. Hey Bill, you're so talented.

647
00:38:55,911 --> 00:38:59,030
Why don't you come up with
something new? Because I'm limited

648
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:01,073
[inaudible]

649
00:39:01,250 --> 00:39:05,580
all right. I never said I fucking,
I would reinvent something. Um,

650
00:39:06,100 --> 00:39:06,271
all right.

651
00:39:06,271 --> 00:39:08,550
Unfortunately I have to take a little
bit of break and I'm going on a nice

652
00:39:08,551 --> 00:39:11,400
little roll here. I'm on a nice
little roll here, but I have a, yeah,

653
00:39:11,401 --> 00:39:13,740
I got something I've got to take
care of, which is why I'm doing this.

654
00:39:13,741 --> 00:39:17,010
At nine o'clock on a Sunday, you know,
but why do I need to tell you guys?

655
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,660
Cause this is only gonna be a fucking
second of your life. Um, alright, hang on.

656
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:25,180
Hang on a moment. Okay, I'm back.

657
00:39:25,210 --> 00:39:29,430
I'm back and I am is
illiterate as ever. Right?

658
00:39:29,450 --> 00:39:32,200
You want to listen to somebody just
fucking tearing me a new one here.

659
00:39:32,770 --> 00:39:37,270
So I was talking about a fucking United
Airlines and Delta and them just yanking

660
00:39:37,271 --> 00:39:42,271
people off of flights and
like what happened to customer
service and all of this

661
00:39:42,920 --> 00:39:43,200
types. You know,

662
00:39:43,200 --> 00:39:48,200
I felt guilty flying United the way they
just dragged that Chinese dude off the

663
00:39:48,251 --> 00:39:52,810
plane though. The two going to
China, just assuming he was Chinese,

664
00:39:53,200 --> 00:39:57,720
Asian. You can give me that right?
Who knows, who knows? They wait,

665
00:39:57,730 --> 00:40:01,360
I'm so fucking hard. I don't
know. You know, fucking

666
00:40:03,400 --> 00:40:08,140
fucking. Anyways, airline
bumping, he said, he says, Hey,

667
00:40:08,141 --> 00:40:12,730
you uninformed cunt and I'll tell you
and nothing makes the reader want to read

668
00:40:12,731 --> 00:40:14,980
more when you just start
off with the insults.

669
00:40:14,981 --> 00:40:19,780
He said Congress and the passenger's bill
of rights have led to more passengers

670
00:40:19,781 --> 00:40:23,140
getting bumped due to more cancellations.

671
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,490
And do you think he gives any examples?
No, he just moves on to his next point.

672
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:32,120
Also, if people showed up
for the flights, they booked,

673
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:34,670
the airlines wouldn't be overbooked.

674
00:40:35,060 --> 00:40:37,910
Many passengers book multiple flights.

675
00:40:38,600 --> 00:40:40,130
How about if you buy,

676
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,760
so you're just assuming that the guys
that they're yanking off the flights,

677
00:40:43,761 --> 00:40:46,520
that those people, I don't do that.

678
00:40:47,300 --> 00:40:50,750
I buy one fucking ticket and
I show up. That's how I do it.

679
00:40:52,140 --> 00:40:57,140
So you're telling me that that Chinese
do to that other fucking person on Delta.

680
00:40:57,180 --> 00:41:00,150
You're telling me that, that, that those
are those people. So they said, Hey,

681
00:41:00,151 --> 00:41:04,650
you book like 20 flights. You only showed
up for one, Eh, get out of that. Fuck.

682
00:41:04,651 --> 00:41:05,880
I said, yeah,

683
00:41:05,881 --> 00:41:10,170
you're telling me that's what happened
or are you telling me that because other

684
00:41:10,171 --> 00:41:15,171
people do that because the guilty people
did it that United and Delta's now just

685
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:19,750
going to grab some random innocent person
and throw them off the fucking flight.

686
00:41:21,460 --> 00:41:25,810
I heard the reason why they did it was
because they had another plane that they

687
00:41:25,811 --> 00:41:29,410
had to get a flight crew to and they
just fucking yanked the guy off.

688
00:41:29,411 --> 00:41:31,930
That has nothing to do with that
other shit as far as I know.

689
00:41:31,931 --> 00:41:33,650
But I hate what am I am just uninformed.

690
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:38,651
Cont evidently you who just like me
just make statements with no fucking

691
00:41:39,471 --> 00:41:42,260
evidence behind it. Alright,
plowing ahead. He goes,

692
00:41:42,380 --> 00:41:46,550
how about if I buy a ticket for a
flight and miss it for whatever reason,

693
00:41:47,420 --> 00:41:49,520
you lose it. Question Mark.

694
00:41:51,660 --> 00:41:55,740
Is that how you run your
shows? Was that a point?

695
00:41:56,550 --> 00:42:01,170
How about if I buy a ticket for a flight
and miss it for whatever reason, comma,

696
00:42:01,171 --> 00:42:06,110
you lose it. Oh, how about if I
don't have a problem with that?

697
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:09,830
I don't have a fucking problem with
that at all. I'm on the same page.

698
00:42:09,980 --> 00:42:13,670
I hate when I show up on time for the
security line and somebody else shows up

699
00:42:13,671 --> 00:42:17,900
super late and then they get rewarded
and get breezed through the fucking line.

700
00:42:18,050 --> 00:42:20,720
Like they're in that t like
they're part of the TSA party.

701
00:42:20,990 --> 00:42:22,400
They're the precheck people.

702
00:42:23,590 --> 00:42:24,000
Yeah,

703
00:42:24,000 --> 00:42:27,480
dude, you bringing up all this other shit
that has nothing to do with a fucking,

704
00:42:27,481 --> 00:42:32,310
just somebody who bought a ticket
and sits on the plane. I drive a car.

705
00:42:32,340 --> 00:42:34,050
Other people steal cars.

706
00:42:35,250 --> 00:42:39,060
Should I be yanked out of my fucking car
cause other people are stealing cars.

707
00:42:39,510 --> 00:42:44,250
This makes no sense. I
might be an uninformed cunt,

708
00:42:44,251 --> 00:42:48,040
but you are a pompous,
arrogant, uninformed continent.

709
00:42:48,840 --> 00:42:51,780
I could say that cause I'm in show
business and you know we're all down to

710
00:42:51,781 --> 00:42:56,460
earth. All right, let me read some more
of your air quote points. All right?

711
00:42:56,461 --> 00:43:00,600
Is that how you, is that
how you run your shows? No,

712
00:43:00,601 --> 00:43:02,700
I don't run my shows like that.
You know, this is my fucking,

713
00:43:02,701 --> 00:43:06,390
this is how I've run my fucking show.
I don't have anybody kicked out ever.

714
00:43:06,391 --> 00:43:07,770
He can be the biggest cunt ever.

715
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:11,310
I kicked the first fucking
person out in 10 years

716
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:17,070
because he was so fucking drunk. I'm
a hell of a guy. I don't give a fuck.

717
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:19,260
I'm a great guy when
it comes to that shit.

718
00:43:19,261 --> 00:43:24,040
How dare you lump me in with United
Airlines and Delta, you, you,

719
00:43:24,050 --> 00:43:26,900
you, you hateful so and
so. All right, let me,

720
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:28,110
let me at least finish this point here.

721
00:43:28,440 --> 00:43:32,850
Is that how you run your shows or if
someone buys a ticket to your show and

722
00:43:32,851 --> 00:43:36,210
misses it due to traffic leaving
the house late, et Cetera,

723
00:43:36,510 --> 00:43:40,200
do you honor their ticket to the
next show? I will tell you this.

724
00:43:40,201 --> 00:43:43,680
I've had plenty of people fucking reach
out to me and I have hooked plenty of

725
00:43:43,681 --> 00:43:47,790
people up with tickets.
Okay, how about that?

726
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:53,520
Has everyone reached out to me? Has
AV, I've seen every fucking email.

727
00:43:53,550 --> 00:43:57,180
No, but I hook people up. I've run into
fucking people walking down the street,

728
00:43:57,181 --> 00:44:01,020
driving by in a Kygo and I'll fuck,
I didn't know. You're like, Duh, hey,

729
00:44:01,021 --> 00:44:05,190
can I go to the show? And I'm
like, it's all soda. I go, fuck it.

730
00:44:05,191 --> 00:44:08,670
What's your name? I've done that
countless times today. He goes, sir,

731
00:44:08,730 --> 00:44:09,780
I don't know what you're talking about.

732
00:44:11,360 --> 00:44:15,080
So the equivalent to that is I fucking
pull up and stand outside the gates of

733
00:44:15,081 --> 00:44:19,670
the airport. Go, hey, you guys fly
to Minneapolis? Uh, yes sir. We are.

734
00:44:20,270 --> 00:44:24,620
Could I, can I buy a chicken?
Sorry, though. It's all sold out.

735
00:44:25,910 --> 00:44:28,040
Oh, bombing. I don't worry
about it. Don't worry.

736
00:44:28,041 --> 00:44:30,680
We'll get you on the plane and
then they fucking Yank someone.

737
00:44:31,720 --> 00:44:33,150
They yanked somebody off.

738
00:44:36,330 --> 00:44:37,163
I don't know

739
00:44:37,910 --> 00:44:40,490
why they pick the Asian guy. Huh?

740
00:44:42,470 --> 00:44:45,560
Why couldn't they pick some fucking
white dude in a suit? You know why?

741
00:44:45,590 --> 00:44:49,490
You know why? All right. Uh, leaving
the house late, do they? Okay.

742
00:44:49,520 --> 00:44:52,880
Well that is what the airlines
do. If you miss a flight,

743
00:44:53,090 --> 00:44:58,040
they put you on another one. So fuck off
you nonreading pigment and paired con.

744
00:44:58,070 --> 00:45:01,580
That's not what they do.
That's what they do sometimes.

745
00:45:02,900 --> 00:45:04,940
Other Times they yank you off the plane.

746
00:45:05,330 --> 00:45:09,980
Other Times they tell you to go fuck
yourself. Other times they say, hey,

747
00:45:10,010 --> 00:45:11,810
you have 200,000 miles.

748
00:45:12,050 --> 00:45:15,890
You can't use them when you want to use
them and if you don't use them by next

749
00:45:15,890 --> 00:45:19,950
Wednesday, we're taking them all
back. Other times they say, hey,

750
00:45:20,100 --> 00:45:23,910
which is charging extra because it's
post nine 11 we lost all this money,

751
00:45:24,000 --> 00:45:25,410
which is charging for food,

752
00:45:25,411 --> 00:45:29,160
but eventually we'll fucking
stop overcharge and we'll
stop charging for this

753
00:45:29,161 --> 00:45:32,550
shit for all the money that we
lost in nine 11 which you know,

754
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:35,040
we're now going to pass
onto our fucking customers.

755
00:45:35,041 --> 00:45:39,900
So they take the hit when was fucking
nine 11 I know I'm an unknown or

756
00:45:39,920 --> 00:45:42,600
uninformed con as far as my calculation.

757
00:45:42,700 --> 00:45:45,390
We're coming up on the 16th
anniversary this September.

758
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:50,470
You still paying for
Pringles, aren't Ya sir?

759
00:45:50,530 --> 00:45:53,110
I'm all for defending the fucking
man when it's, when it's for,

760
00:45:53,111 --> 00:45:57,870
I mean I don't know what you just
fucking, you just brought up a bunch of,

761
00:45:58,820 --> 00:46:01,720
but I guess behavior by for
the frequent flyer people.

762
00:46:01,721 --> 00:46:05,290
So then evidently I should get yanked
off the plane at some point because other

763
00:46:05,291 --> 00:46:08,000
people overbook and shit.
You know what you're,

764
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:11,600
you're the kind of person that probably
likes that dead where they call it the

765
00:46:11,601 --> 00:46:14,510
trap ride or the trick car,
whatever that fucking show is.

766
00:46:14,870 --> 00:46:17,810
You probably like that show. You probably
think that that's a good fucking show,

767
00:46:17,811 --> 00:46:19,500
right? That shit,

768
00:46:19,520 --> 00:46:23,230
I can't even believe that fucking
show was on television for the,

769
00:46:23,540 --> 00:46:27,120
it's on true TV. We
should change the name,

770
00:46:27,230 --> 00:46:30,410
the fucking horrific TV they fucking take.

771
00:46:30,440 --> 00:46:35,090
They drive down to like the
fucking projects and they take,

772
00:46:35,180 --> 00:46:39,140
I believe a car with the door open keys
in it running and then they wait for

773
00:46:39,141 --> 00:46:42,410
someone to fucking steal it and then
they act like they got a bad guy off the

774
00:46:42,411 --> 00:46:46,670
fucking street and I was reading
comments underneath the, you know,

775
00:46:46,930 --> 00:46:51,750
I love that they're going to go out of
their fucking way to go down there and

776
00:46:51,751 --> 00:46:53,400
try to get someone to go to jail.

777
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:57,670
Why don't you go down there and try
to help somebody out? I saw one guy,

778
00:46:57,671 --> 00:47:01,390
he actually stole the fucking car. He
knew it was the trap car or whatever.

779
00:47:01,720 --> 00:47:04,090
He's driving with the door open
because he knows that they just locked,

780
00:47:04,120 --> 00:47:06,520
they fucking hit the
locks. He can't get out.

781
00:47:07,120 --> 00:47:09,580
And he's saying he knows it's the trap
car he's waving to the camera and all

782
00:47:09,581 --> 00:47:11,860
that. They asked him if he knows a
trap car, why did you do it? He said,

783
00:47:11,861 --> 00:47:13,300
I don't know, maybe I
just want to get on TV.

784
00:47:13,301 --> 00:47:15,790
And then he left and everybody's
like, tech guy's crazy.

785
00:47:15,791 --> 00:47:19,330
I want to party with that guy. That
guy's a dope or anything. It was, it was,

786
00:47:19,331 --> 00:47:22,190
to me it was fucking depressing like that.

787
00:47:22,210 --> 00:47:25,210
That's the level of options this guy
has in his fucking life that he would do

788
00:47:25,211 --> 00:47:28,630
something like that and somebody
else brought up a great point. Okay.

789
00:47:28,870 --> 00:47:33,180
Like why don't they take that car around
the fucking suburbs to the whites,

790
00:47:33,440 --> 00:47:35,370
the sax. Why don't they
do that? And he was

791
00:47:37,850 --> 00:47:41,920
still cut the fuck they don't. They
absolutely do. And I'll tell you,

792
00:47:41,921 --> 00:47:44,080
there's a point in my fucking
life I would've done that.

793
00:47:44,590 --> 00:47:47,500
I absolutely would've done that
just for this stupid fucking,

794
00:47:47,501 --> 00:47:51,130
just to have the story so I could talk
about it loudly around chicks that I

795
00:47:51,131 --> 00:47:53,260
liked because I didn't know
any other way to approach them.

796
00:47:54,500 --> 00:47:55,333
Okay.

797
00:47:57,000 --> 00:48:01,020
If they ever did that in a fucking
suburb, in a bunch of white kids,

798
00:48:01,021 --> 00:48:03,710
started going to jail over
that shit. That shit would not,

799
00:48:03,740 --> 00:48:04,830
there'll be entrapment.

800
00:48:04,920 --> 00:48:07,920
It wouldn't be held up in court and
the fucking show would be shut down.

801
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,550
All I'm saying. Okay. You, sorry.
You probably liked that type of shit.

802
00:48:11,551 --> 00:48:14,220
You probably liked that show. Do you
think that's a good show and hey, let's,

803
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:17,370
let's, uh, you know, rather than giving
this guy an opportunity, you know,

804
00:48:17,490 --> 00:48:19,290
they could just as
easily couldn't true TV,

805
00:48:19,291 --> 00:48:21,420
have a fucking show where they go down
there and they try to give somebody a

806
00:48:21,421 --> 00:48:23,690
fucking job, you know?

807
00:48:24,690 --> 00:48:25,380
Okay.

808
00:48:25,380 --> 00:48:28,530
I Dunno. Anyways, plowing ahead,

809
00:48:28,560 --> 00:48:33,510
making your own baby
food a Billy burp. Um,

810
00:48:33,540 --> 00:48:36,330
had my first kid a couple of
years ago, congratulations.

811
00:48:36,331 --> 00:48:41,220
A friend suggested we make our own baby
food because it's easier to get them to

812
00:48:41,221 --> 00:48:45,660
transition to real and healthy
foods. We tried it and it was fun.

813
00:48:46,580 --> 00:48:47,413
Okay.

814
00:48:47,980 --> 00:48:48,350
For instance,

815
00:48:48,350 --> 00:48:51,270
that we make our own baby food because
it's easier to get them to transition.

816
00:48:51,271 --> 00:48:54,630
Okay. All right. We could, hi, there's
another fucking guy. No lab coat.

817
00:48:54,631 --> 00:48:57,630
No degree. We couldn't do it 100% of
the time, but it was totally worth it.

818
00:48:57,631 --> 00:49:01,000
My kid isn't that picky of an
eater and I liked that. Thank,

819
00:49:01,001 --> 00:49:04,240
I think that days of pulverizing fruits,

820
00:49:04,250 --> 00:49:08,200
vegetables and oats into tasting
meals. Oh, it's because of that.

821
00:49:08,920 --> 00:49:11,740
I'm sure you can afford that.
Good stuff for the little lady,

822
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,520
but just thought I'd throw it out
there. Thanks. And Go fuck yourself yet.

823
00:49:15,550 --> 00:49:17,770
I don't know too. I don't
know what to tell you.

824
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:21,700
I'll cross that fucking road running.
Everybody's always like, you know,

825
00:49:22,290 --> 00:49:25,360
you've got all these goddamn
suggestions. There was somebody fucking,

826
00:49:25,361 --> 00:49:30,220
you know everybody talking about like
private schools versus public schools.

827
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:33,520
It's like these fucking kids, they
don't even get to be kids anymore.

828
00:49:34,180 --> 00:49:35,680
They should be out fucking, you know,

829
00:49:37,260 --> 00:49:41,160
this whole fucking thing that you know
from day one, like he gets gotta be like,

830
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:42,540
you've seen what it does.

831
00:49:42,541 --> 00:49:46,450
Look in these countries that
fucking push their kids too hard.

832
00:49:48,680 --> 00:49:51,180
They, they have like
ulcerated fucking bottles.

833
00:49:51,360 --> 00:49:54,560
Like they've been working on fucking
Wall Street for 60 goddamn years and then

834
00:49:54,570 --> 00:49:58,770
like seven. The level of stress
that they put on them. Fuck that.

835
00:49:59,160 --> 00:50:01,230
My Kid's going to be a
God damn kid. All right.

836
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:05,010
I flunked everything fucking in in
high school. I fucked up everything.

837
00:50:05,550 --> 00:50:08,520
I got arrested for drinking and
driving. I was unloading trucks.

838
00:50:08,521 --> 00:50:11,100
I did all of this shit. And then one day
I just figured out what the fuck do I,

839
00:50:11,130 --> 00:50:15,680
what do I want to do? You
know, found a passion.

840
00:50:15,830 --> 00:50:19,100
And I followed it and I was fine.
And I remember back in the day,

841
00:50:19,101 --> 00:50:21,230
they used to fuck, oh, you
need two years of a language.

842
00:50:21,350 --> 00:50:23,730
If you don't have two years of a fucking
language, you can't love all that.

843
00:50:23,731 --> 00:50:24,740
It's all fucking bull. You know,

844
00:50:24,750 --> 00:50:28,370
I used to say that the fucking
language teacher, fuck everybody.

845
00:50:29,810 --> 00:50:30,531
Fuck everybody.

846
00:50:30,531 --> 00:50:35,210
Let your kid be a Goddamn kid and fuck
all these fucking private schools within

847
00:50:35,211 --> 00:50:37,460
nine zillion dollar fucking, you know. Oh,

848
00:50:37,550 --> 00:50:41,090
you better get in when the kids
are just playing with blocks.

849
00:50:41,480 --> 00:50:42,950
The early you you get in,

850
00:50:43,070 --> 00:50:46,280
the better chance you have for your
kid to continue on. In other words,

851
00:50:46,281 --> 00:50:48,680
start fucking line in our pockets now.

852
00:50:51,160 --> 00:50:52,670
You know, why don't you
just have you, I don't know,

853
00:50:52,960 --> 00:50:54,710
want to be cheaper to just
have your kid homeschooled.

854
00:50:55,790 --> 00:50:57,470
You're going to drop
all that fucking cash,

855
00:50:57,471 --> 00:51:01,970
like he's already going to Yale and
fucking going to school and they go on the

856
00:51:01,971 --> 00:51:06,830
wheels on the bus go round and
round. Round air. That'll be enough.

857
00:51:06,860 --> 00:51:09,740
Yeah. The credit card didn't work. Yeah.
I can't teach you the rest of the song.

858
00:51:10,260 --> 00:51:14,120
All right. Birthday Boat Party. A bill,

859
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,590
a bald headed eagle. Jesus.

860
00:51:17,591 --> 00:51:21,320
Go and fucking old school on that one. Um,

861
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:26,060
hey, a Chesler. Hey, a sidewinder.

862
00:51:26,580 --> 00:51:29,660
Recently my girlfriend dumped
me over a text message.

863
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:34,100
I swear to God if that, if that
existed back in the day, I would,

864
00:51:34,101 --> 00:51:37,940
I would fucking be lightened phones
up if that wasn't bad enough.

865
00:51:37,941 --> 00:51:42,941
I got the texts just as I was
walking into a movie with a buddy.

866
00:51:43,250 --> 00:51:47,210
She told me straight that she didn't
love me anymore. I took a like a man,

867
00:51:47,211 --> 00:51:50,260
watch the movie, went home
and cried like a bitch.

868
00:51:50,930 --> 00:51:52,850
I honest guy.

869
00:51:53,270 --> 00:51:58,010
Two days later I went to a party
on a boat. I spotted my now ex.

870
00:51:58,040 --> 00:52:00,620
We made eye contact and she looked away.

871
00:52:00,830 --> 00:52:03,860
So now I'm trapped on
a boat for four hours.

872
00:52:04,580 --> 00:52:07,820
You didn't know that she was going to
be there with a bunch of drunk cons.

873
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:10,130
I don't want to be
around. And of course her,

874
00:52:10,340 --> 00:52:13,580
I made an attempt to ask her why the
fuck she didn't have the balls to dump me

875
00:52:13,581 --> 00:52:17,600
face to face, but she ignored me
totally. As she's young and immature,

876
00:52:18,110 --> 00:52:22,430
I then saw her walk over to a guy
and start kissing him. Jesus Christ.

877
00:52:23,810 --> 00:52:24,720
I commend you, sir,

878
00:52:24,850 --> 00:52:28,910
for not throwing yourself in them also
overboard and fucking double murder.

879
00:52:28,911 --> 00:52:32,780
Slash suicide bill. I have no fucking
idea. I didn't punch this con,

880
00:52:32,781 --> 00:52:37,490
but I decided not to. I now wish I
had punched his stupid fucking face.

881
00:52:37,491 --> 00:52:41,450
And my question is, what should I,
should I have done something? Fuck now,

882
00:52:42,770 --> 00:52:46,070
why are you punching him? He's doing
what he's supposed to be doing.

883
00:52:46,680 --> 00:52:51,020
He supposed to be out there trying to
fucking hook up with women. All right?

884
00:52:51,410 --> 00:52:55,130
Any bad feelings you have should be
towards her. But here's the thing, dude.

885
00:52:55,820 --> 00:53:00,680
You know, in the long run she did your
favor because she didn't love you. Okay.

886
00:53:00,681 --> 00:53:04,340
And eventually she could've done that
while you had two kids with her and you

887
00:53:04,341 --> 00:53:08,780
actually had to pay her fucking
money. She did you a favor. All right?

888
00:53:10,220 --> 00:53:12,290
Yeah. Don't ever do that.
That's the dumbest shit ever.

889
00:53:12,291 --> 00:53:16,070
When people fucking date somebody and
then they get dumped and then they're

890
00:53:16,071 --> 00:53:17,930
fucking dating somebody else. I mean,

891
00:53:17,960 --> 00:53:21,320
and then you go over and you confront
the other fucking birthday that they're

892
00:53:21,321 --> 00:53:26,010
outside the circle, you know? So, um,

893
00:53:27,240 --> 00:53:29,880
what should he have done? You should
just been a fucking gentleman.

894
00:53:31,290 --> 00:53:33,660
That's what you should have done. You
just be a fucking gentleman. Just be like,

895
00:53:33,661 --> 00:53:37,980
hey, you know, evidently, you know,
she doesn't want to be with me anymore.

896
00:53:37,981 --> 00:53:40,920
I mean, dude, I know. Listen, I got
dumped. I know fucking hard. This is,

897
00:53:40,921 --> 00:53:41,754
I'm on time.

898
00:53:42,840 --> 00:53:47,520
I actually fucking was talking
to somebody's heart on the table.

899
00:53:47,521 --> 00:53:51,330
This woman dumped me out of fucking
nowhere. And I'm in a bar, of course,

900
00:53:51,900 --> 00:53:53,750
and I'm talking to a buddy of mine. And,

901
00:53:53,751 --> 00:53:58,650
and the problem was he got dumped like
four years earlier and he still wasn't

902
00:53:58,651 --> 00:54:02,610
over it and he fucking hated women. So
this is why I'm pouring my heart out to,

903
00:54:03,330 --> 00:54:07,110
and I was like, you know, I mean I
thought everything was going fine.

904
00:54:07,230 --> 00:54:10,560
What the fuck? And I did all that shit
and he just goes, hey, you know, I dunno.

905
00:54:11,670 --> 00:54:14,730
Maybe she wanted to fuck
somebody else. And I just said,

906
00:54:14,731 --> 00:54:18,840
you know what to I said, you know
what? Fuck you. I actually flipped out.

907
00:54:18,841 --> 00:54:21,750
I was like, fuck you. You fuck. That
has nothing to fucking do with this.

908
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:24,900
That has to do with that
fucking shit. That fucking cunt.

909
00:54:24,901 --> 00:54:26,520
You dated four fucking years ago.

910
00:54:26,610 --> 00:54:30,240
You still not over and I've been having
a fucking carry you off the field like

911
00:54:30,241 --> 00:54:34,440
Kellen Winslow after that fucking overtime
game for laugh on every fucking bar

912
00:54:34,441 --> 00:54:37,200
for the last four years. You can't
sit there. He's like, dude, I'm sorry.

913
00:54:37,201 --> 00:54:40,830
Tag Off. Fuck off. Not
just part of a bad memory.

914
00:54:42,900 --> 00:54:46,500
I'm actually, did I say that?

915
00:54:46,501 --> 00:54:48,240
That's probably what I
said on the way home.

916
00:54:48,300 --> 00:54:51,450
I think I said that on the way
home. I think I just said, fuck you.

917
00:54:51,570 --> 00:54:54,540
And I walked out of the bar.
That's right. That's what happened.

918
00:54:54,570 --> 00:54:58,650
That's how old I am. I'm so
old. My memory is the fantasy.

919
00:55:03,080 --> 00:55:03,360
Okay.

920
00:55:03,360 --> 00:55:05,430
My memory is what I should've said.

921
00:55:06,990 --> 00:55:11,760
I did say fuck you. And I walked down
Zocalo you know, just fucking walked up.

922
00:55:12,930 --> 00:55:15,690
Uh, one of the few times I didn't pay
for my round of beers, I was just like,

923
00:55:15,691 --> 00:55:19,680
fuck you walked out. Um, anyways,
he said, hope you're well,

924
00:55:19,681 --> 00:55:22,410
thanks and go fuck yourself
dude. You took it like a man.

925
00:55:22,411 --> 00:55:27,340
What are you going to
do? And um, you know,

926
00:55:28,210 --> 00:55:31,420
keep taking it like a man and keep going
home and private and cry it out here.

927
00:55:31,450 --> 00:55:36,250
That's what women do. Fucking they cried
out of them and then they can move on.

928
00:55:36,690 --> 00:55:36,760
Uh,

929
00:55:36,760 --> 00:55:39,580
the fact that she dumped you and then of
course it does immediately make an hour

930
00:55:39,581 --> 00:55:42,940
with this guy is really suspect.
But you never know with them.

931
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,650
You never know. That could have just,
she could've just picked that guy.

932
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:49,740
Yeah,

933
00:55:49,740 --> 00:55:53,100
because you were there. You have no
fucking idea. And here's the thing, dude,

934
00:55:53,101 --> 00:55:57,400
even if she was already banging that
fucking Douche, wow, I'll make an hour.

935
00:55:57,660 --> 00:55:59,940
That douche when she was with
you, then that's the time.

936
00:55:59,970 --> 00:56:04,890
That's who you are with. So
good fucking riddance. Alright.

937
00:56:05,880 --> 00:56:06,730
That's what you had you,

938
00:56:06,731 --> 00:56:10,320
you thought you drafted somebody in the
first round that didn't fucking work

939
00:56:10,321 --> 00:56:14,910
out. And you know what? That guy just
picked up her contract for you. You know,

940
00:56:15,060 --> 00:56:18,000
so now you got all this
cap space. All right,

941
00:56:18,001 --> 00:56:22,500
go cry or out of your fucking heart. You
know, but don't go around hating women.

942
00:56:22,680 --> 00:56:24,970
That's what I did. Big fucking mistake.

943
00:56:24,971 --> 00:56:28,510
All that does is it stop you from meeting
a fucking sweetheart because you know

944
00:56:28,511 --> 00:56:32,830
who loves an angry woman hater. A
fucking psycho chick. All right,

945
00:56:33,220 --> 00:56:35,680
there you go. All right.
Russian girlfriend,

946
00:56:36,490 --> 00:56:40,330
a Billy blue balls. Hey
Man, I was well, hey man,

947
00:56:40,331 --> 00:56:42,190
I was wondering if you
could give me some advice.

948
00:56:42,460 --> 00:56:47,020
I'm a 27 year old from New Zealand
and current resident and current.

949
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:48,910
Oh Jesus.

950
00:56:48,910 --> 00:56:52,270
And current currently residing is what
you should have said instead of current

951
00:56:52,450 --> 00:56:57,160
residing here. Current resident
here. Currently designing here. Okay.

952
00:56:57,161 --> 00:57:00,190
I've met and recently started
dating a girl from Russia.

953
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:04,510
We've been officially dating
for about five months now.

954
00:57:04,930 --> 00:57:07,420
Everything is going
great. Never been happier.

955
00:57:07,450 --> 00:57:10,360
If she ever asked you to take a boat
ride, don't get on the fucking boat.

956
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:14,320
All right. And I'm not talking about
because of the last thing. All right,

957
00:57:14,470 --> 00:57:17,440
this one, you show up as a couple
other shifty guys there and then, uh,

958
00:57:17,441 --> 00:57:21,310
your identity gets stolen and we never
see you again. All right. She's hot.

959
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:24,220
Best in bed I've ever
had and I've had a lot.

960
00:57:24,221 --> 00:57:29,221
Ha Ha got a great personality and someone
I could see going further into the

961
00:57:29,411 --> 00:57:31,750
future with. Okay,

962
00:57:31,751 --> 00:57:34,690
well you're writing me so I know
the other shoe's going to drop.

963
00:57:35,050 --> 00:57:39,640
The only issue is that our visa is
about to run out in a few months. Oh,

964
00:57:39,641 --> 00:57:42,940
before she moves back. Unless we can,

965
00:57:43,240 --> 00:57:45,520
she can find a decent job here.

966
00:57:46,360 --> 00:57:51,360
The only issue with that is the job market
over here for the type of work she is

967
00:57:53,171 --> 00:57:55,990
after is very small, a translator.

968
00:57:56,770 --> 00:58:01,150
We've been checking the job sites and
whatnot over the past month with not much

969
00:58:01,151 --> 00:58:01,984
luck.

970
00:58:02,830 --> 00:58:07,830
So I've put up the idea of maybe heading
over to Russia and try to start a life

971
00:58:08,381 --> 00:58:11,140
over there. Oh No, fuck no,

972
00:58:12,820 --> 00:58:15,760
but that's a great way to see if she's
with you because she wants to be with you

973
00:58:15,761 --> 00:58:17,530
though. A,

974
00:58:17,750 --> 00:58:21,220
my qualification could take
me anywhere in the world,

975
00:58:21,221 --> 00:58:24,100
but I'm still skeptical on, well,

976
00:58:24,101 --> 00:58:27,310
should I just uplift my whole life and
move to a country that doesn't really

977
00:58:27,311 --> 00:58:28,360
speak much English?

978
00:58:28,390 --> 00:58:31,870
Apparently with my girlfriend that
I've only known for a few months,

979
00:58:31,871 --> 00:58:34,330
plus not knowing much Russian. Yeah.

980
00:58:34,331 --> 00:58:36,670
Plus you don't know how
that country fucking works.

981
00:58:38,210 --> 00:58:39,043
All right.

982
00:58:40,250 --> 00:58:43,280
You have no idea how that
fucking country works, dude.

983
00:58:44,560 --> 00:58:45,300
Okay.

984
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,910
You're talking like you're
dealing with the fucking mob.

985
00:58:48,390 --> 00:58:49,223
Wow.

986
00:58:50,480 --> 00:58:54,800
Hang on one second. All right. Sorry.
I just realized I double book myself.

987
00:58:54,801 --> 00:58:57,980
I had to fucking figure something
out. Yeah, dude, you have no idea.

988
00:58:57,981 --> 00:58:59,360
Like what's going on over there?

989
00:58:59,361 --> 00:59:02,450
Like if that's a whole different
fucking animal over there,

990
00:59:02,600 --> 00:59:06,860
that's a whole different government.
The level of influence that the mob has.

991
00:59:06,861 --> 00:59:10,940
I mean that shit is fucking hardcore
over there. Russia is no joke.

992
00:59:11,480 --> 00:59:13,310
What the fuck did you
say you account from?

993
00:59:13,700 --> 00:59:17,930
You've gone from New Zealand or Russia.
You gave him the gardening. Fucked up,

994
00:59:17,931 --> 00:59:21,020
dude. Fuck that. Fuck debt

995
00:59:22,440 --> 00:59:23,273
fucked up.

996
00:59:24,090 --> 00:59:27,180
Get her a job interview. They'll see
how beautiful she is in, you know,

997
00:59:28,140 --> 00:59:29,940
you know, do what you can fucking do,

998
00:59:31,020 --> 00:59:33,750
dude. Fuck that. Fuck that

999
00:59:34,750 --> 00:59:38,770
repeat. Fuck that. I mean, I remember
when I had been reading the rest of this.

1000
00:59:38,800 --> 00:59:42,400
Fuck that. Do not move from
fucking New Zealand to Russia.

1001
00:59:43,990 --> 00:59:45,640
Jesus fucking Christ.

1002
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:52,410
Do not do that. Please don't do that.
Okay? I never beg in the podcast,

1003
00:59:52,411 --> 00:59:55,050
but I'm begging you right
now. Do not fucking do that.

1004
00:59:57,000 --> 01:00:00,450
Jesus can go from the fucking garden of
Eden to then. Now you're the immigrant.

1005
01:00:00,451 --> 01:00:02,190
Now she's trying to get you a fucking job.

1006
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,820
You know what kind of money
you're gonna make over there.

1007
01:00:07,070 --> 01:00:07,400
Okay?

1008
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:10,290
I got no fucking, I def.
Fuck that. All right.

1009
01:00:10,291 --> 01:00:15,210
Soccer coach rips off shirt after
rejection. Hey Billy. Dad. Sec.

1010
01:00:21,550 --> 01:00:21,820
Okay.

1011
01:00:21,820 --> 01:00:22,481
Oh,

1012
01:00:22,481 --> 01:00:26,900
that was as original as Billy
Bald Eagle was a not all right.

1013
01:00:27,010 --> 01:00:31,600
Saw this video and thought it might
interest you during a recent soccer game.

1014
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:36,720
And Argentinian player accidentally knocks
a player out from the other team and

1015
01:00:37,481 --> 01:00:41,260
ends up getting a [inaudible] from the
game. As a result, after he gets ejected,

1016
01:00:41,261 --> 01:00:45,220
the coach freaks out. Yeah, watch
the clip, starts yelling at the refs,

1017
01:00:45,221 --> 01:00:50,140
then he gets ejected. So when he
realizes that he's also objected,

1018
01:00:50,141 --> 01:00:54,790
he rips his shirt off only to reveal,
and he's an older guy too, you know?

1019
01:00:54,880 --> 01:00:56,260
I don't know. I can't tell all the guys.

1020
01:00:56,261 --> 01:01:01,261
Somewhere between 40 and 50 rips his
shirt off only to reveal that not only is

1021
01:01:01,661 --> 01:01:03,010
this dude fucking shredded,

1022
01:01:03,310 --> 01:01:06,670
but also his whole back
is covered in tattoos,

1023
01:01:07,510 --> 01:01:11,740
making him look like he spends his free
time going to bare knuckle brawling down

1024
01:01:11,830 --> 01:01:16,180
by the shipyard. Thanks for all the
laughs and go fuck yourself. Yeah,

1025
01:01:17,020 --> 01:01:20,590
I watched the clip of this.
This guy looks like a,

1026
01:01:21,610 --> 01:01:23,440
this guy looks like he's
done some time in prison.

1027
01:01:23,441 --> 01:01:28,000
What's amazing is the rest of his body
that you can see, he has no tattoos.

1028
01:01:28,001 --> 01:01:29,650
And then on the back it's just like,

1029
01:01:29,651 --> 01:01:33,340
I don't know what the fuck he's got
going on, but his entire back is covered.

1030
01:01:33,880 --> 01:01:38,530
And it's all of those,
you know, uh, you know,

1031
01:01:38,560 --> 01:01:41,950
if you touch my family, I will fucking
kill you. It's those kinds of tattoos.

1032
01:01:41,951 --> 01:01:45,730
It's not the A, I was in a frat and I
got drunk one night and uh, all right,

1033
01:01:45,760 --> 01:01:49,660
this is my old girlfriend's name and we
fucking turned into a swan or whatever

1034
01:01:49,661 --> 01:01:52,600
the fuck they do. This is
like hardcore, you know,

1035
01:01:52,601 --> 01:01:54,280
this guy's going to
punch you in the throat.

1036
01:01:57,210 --> 01:01:57,490
Okay.

1037
01:01:57,490 --> 01:01:59,620
It's a great clip. I really
appreciate it. All right,

1038
01:01:59,650 --> 01:02:01,180
let me make sure I did everything here.

1039
01:02:02,010 --> 01:02:06,550
A Russian girlfriend do not stay in
New Zealand birthday boat party. Yep.

1040
01:02:06,610 --> 01:02:11,590
A, you got a lot of cap space. Good
for you making your own baby food. Yes.

1041
01:02:11,591 --> 01:02:15,310
You know, I'll, I'll see about that
airline bumping a agree to disagree,

1042
01:02:15,340 --> 01:02:18,010
but I like the fact that you went out
there and stuck up for the airlines.

1043
01:02:19,500 --> 01:02:22,200
[inaudible] I think that's it. He's
right. All the things, right. Oh,

1044
01:02:22,201 --> 01:02:25,770
I didn't talk about the f one race
motherfucker. Did you guys watch it?

1045
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,750
They have. I got, I know, I know.

1046
01:02:27,751 --> 01:02:31,980
After Nias just absolutely
eviscerated watching racing.

1047
01:02:32,040 --> 01:02:33,690
I hope if you were going to watch a race,

1048
01:02:33,870 --> 01:02:37,410
the Spanish Grand Prix was a great
one. Lewis Hamilton had the pole.

1049
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,220
Sebastian Vettel uh, I think was, yeah,

1050
01:02:41,221 --> 01:02:43,620
it was in the second
position. And then, uh,

1051
01:02:44,860 --> 01:02:46,170
Boris Karloff Leboeuf I can't
keep forgetting his name.

1052
01:02:46,170 --> 01:02:50,760
Fucking Lewis Hamilton's
um, uh, driving mate there.

1053
01:02:52,410 --> 01:02:54,360
His fucking car caught on
fire. But the first guy,

1054
01:02:54,361 --> 01:02:56,510
the other guy who drives for
Ferrari, whatever, fucking his,

1055
01:02:56,550 --> 01:03:01,140
whatever his name is, Ricky
Ricardo. I can't remember. Um, no.

1056
01:03:01,890 --> 01:03:05,910
Daniel Ricardo drives for force India.
No, he doesn't. He drives for red bull.

1057
01:03:06,990 --> 01:03:09,690
Why don't I just fucking go on
and look up the Goddamn names?

1058
01:03:10,200 --> 01:03:12,240
Cause most of you guys don't
watch this shit seat on it.

1059
01:03:12,241 --> 01:03:14,310
You don't know what you guys
know as much as I fucking know.

1060
01:03:15,060 --> 01:03:17,130
So here's what happened. All right.

1061
01:03:18,480 --> 01:03:22,020
The race starts and uh,

1062
01:03:22,950 --> 01:03:24,090
what's his face?

1063
01:03:25,200 --> 01:03:27,960
Lewis Hamilton has always
gets a bad fucking start.

1064
01:03:28,080 --> 01:03:32,160
Sebastian Vettel goes around them.
That'll drives the Ferrari's.

1065
01:03:33,060 --> 01:03:35,130
Lewis Hamilton's with Mercedes. Uh,

1066
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:37,600
Vettel is out in front on how
many fucking points he was ahead.

1067
01:03:37,620 --> 01:03:40,830
He was like 15 points
ahead of some shit. And uh,

1068
01:03:41,010 --> 01:03:44,550
in the old days last year when I wive
on watching for a year, the old days,

1069
01:03:44,551 --> 01:03:47,320
which is Monaco of last year,
when I started watching, if you,

1070
01:03:47,510 --> 01:03:50,850
if you went to the turn
first, whoever won got,

1071
01:03:51,240 --> 01:03:54,210
got through the first turn first in
first place, drove in the clean air.

1072
01:03:54,210 --> 01:03:57,720
That was it. You won the fucking race
unless you messed up a pit stop or you,

1073
01:03:58,260 --> 01:04:02,970
your car shit the bed. So
he gets out in front. Um,

1074
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:04,860
and then his is his buddy there.

1075
01:04:05,790 --> 01:04:09,210
The other Ferrari guy gets
knocked out of the race. Okay.

1076
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:13,230
And they fucking, they cut to a,

1077
01:04:13,231 --> 01:04:18,030
this kid in the stands were in this
Ferrari thing. Where are the drivers?

1078
01:04:18,031 --> 01:04:20,850
Why is it so difficult?
Drivers, here we go. Here we go.

1079
01:04:21,990 --> 01:04:23,940
I should add this all
ready to go. I'm sorry.

1080
01:04:23,941 --> 01:04:25,770
I'm like slowing this the fuck down.

1081
01:04:26,250 --> 01:04:29,100
The Reagan in guy gets
knocked right out of the race.

1082
01:04:29,430 --> 01:04:31,770
And this little fucking
kid, they cut to him,

1083
01:04:31,950 --> 01:04:36,830
he's wearing all Ferrari gear and he's
just crying his eyes out and in they're

1084
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:37,680
sitting there going, well,

1085
01:04:37,681 --> 01:04:42,510
like federal still in first place
while he must've been a big uh,

1086
01:04:43,040 --> 01:04:47,130
Reagan and fan over the fuck he say his
name and they showed him twice bawling

1087
01:04:47,131 --> 01:04:49,950
his eyes out. I couldn't believe a
kid this little was that into racing.

1088
01:04:49,951 --> 01:04:53,250
I thought it was really
cool. And uh, later on, um,

1089
01:04:53,251 --> 01:04:55,590
the driver got knocked out of
the race Ferrari. They actually,

1090
01:04:55,591 --> 01:04:58,110
they brought the kid in and he took
a picture with them and everything.

1091
01:04:58,111 --> 01:04:59,280
So I ended up being a good deal,

1092
01:04:59,460 --> 01:05:02,940
although he probably cried again when
Lewis Hamilton went around and, but um,

1093
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:08,250
anyways, it was a great race from
front to back. These new fucking tires,

1094
01:05:08,251 --> 01:05:12,810
I guess. I have no idea why they
got more grip that's more passing.

1095
01:05:13,950 --> 01:05:16,740
Um, Lewis Hamilton past, um,

1096
01:05:16,750 --> 01:05:21,370
Sebastian Vettel I think on like
lap light. It's like 20 laps to go,

1097
01:05:21,580 --> 01:05:23,530
which never happened last year.

1098
01:05:23,740 --> 01:05:27,010
The second place guy just could never get
around the first place guy once he was

1099
01:05:27,011 --> 01:05:31,810
out there. Um, I dunno,
it was a great race.

1100
01:05:31,811 --> 01:05:34,390
And then Lewis Hamilton for some reason
was like fucking out of breath when he

1101
01:05:34,391 --> 01:05:37,300
was talking cause he was saying because
they got the fatter tires they could

1102
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:40,930
pull more gs in like just the physically
what the fuck they were going through.

1103
01:05:41,530 --> 01:05:44,170
And Lewis Hamilton didn't
have any drinks on board.

1104
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:47,200
I didn't know they had drinks on
board. I then never even dawned on me,

1105
01:05:47,710 --> 01:05:49,900
but he didn't want to add
any more weight to his car,

1106
01:05:50,290 --> 01:05:54,880
so he lost like four and a half pounds.
So they go, you know that actually,

1107
01:05:54,940 --> 01:05:59,940
you know this people out here in Hollywood
that have enough money now that the

1108
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:03,910
day before they have to go to like a
red carpet event. They're gonna fucking,

1109
01:06:04,360 --> 01:06:05,020
you know,

1110
01:06:05,020 --> 01:06:09,490
drive around in a fucking race car for
three hours so they can drop that final

1111
01:06:09,491 --> 01:06:12,340
fucking four and a half pounds. I'm
telling you, it's going to happen.

1112
01:06:12,790 --> 01:06:16,210
So I believe the next,
next race is in Monaco. Um,

1113
01:06:17,560 --> 01:06:17,861
I don't know.

1114
01:06:17,861 --> 01:06:20,620
I'm enjoying watching it and he has
got me all self conscious about talking

1115
01:06:20,621 --> 01:06:23,920
about it. Now I'm going to blame her
then I wasn't prepared to talk about it.

1116
01:06:25,120 --> 01:06:27,910
Um, was there anything else
on my, my little list here.

1117
01:06:29,260 --> 01:06:32,740
So as you nerds always wanted to rift the
whole thing? Pretty much. Pretty much.

1118
01:06:32,741 --> 01:06:35,350
But I make like a setlist a
shit. Didn't want to talk to,

1119
01:06:35,351 --> 01:06:38,770
if I can fucking find
it. Where the hell is it?

1120
01:06:40,660 --> 01:06:44,170
I give up. I fucking give up with
this shit. What did I have on here?

1121
01:06:44,860 --> 01:06:47,530
I don't know what that is.
We'll close this window.

1122
01:06:47,740 --> 01:06:50,920
This is the most anticlimactic
ending to a podcast ever. All right.

1123
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:55,270
I said predators. Louis Han Hamilton,
Sebastian Vale, Daniel Ricardo,

1124
01:06:55,271 --> 01:06:58,570
first time he was on a
a podium this year. Oh,

1125
01:06:58,680 --> 01:07:03,550
he had to give a shout out to a force.
India still rocking the Fuchsia,

1126
01:07:03,580 --> 01:07:08,200
whatever color that is. Um,
I think that was it. Oh,

1127
01:07:08,201 --> 01:07:09,250
happy mother's Day.

1128
01:07:09,280 --> 01:07:12,760
Belated Mother's Day to all the
mothers out there at a great time.

1129
01:07:12,761 --> 01:07:16,180
We went to brunch. Yep. That's where
I am right now. I went to brunch.

1130
01:07:16,570 --> 01:07:19,930
My parents came out, met
their granddaughter there
over the, over the moon,

1131
01:07:20,560 --> 01:07:25,360
loving her. She was so cute and was
just, didn't cry at all the whole meal.

1132
01:07:25,390 --> 01:07:28,360
And then she got in the
car and then that was it.

1133
01:07:28,390 --> 01:07:33,190
She had friggin had it and was
just crying up a storm. And uh,

1134
01:07:33,210 --> 01:07:36,160
but it was, we ended up having a great
day and I came home and I was like,

1135
01:07:37,660 --> 01:07:40,840
it was crazy. You know, I've just
finally entered this part of my life,

1136
01:07:41,620 --> 01:07:43,810
you know, my parents are
older. I got a little one,

1137
01:07:44,100 --> 01:07:47,380
I'm at Brunch and I have
no say in the matter.

1138
01:07:49,260 --> 01:07:52,150
And you know what? It feels good.
I had a great time, you know,

1139
01:07:52,151 --> 01:07:53,960
we had all kinds of
family, had a big crew,

1140
01:07:53,961 --> 01:07:58,961
seven or eight people and we went to
this fucking insane brunch and everybody

1141
01:07:59,501 --> 01:08:02,940
threw down and uh,

1142
01:08:03,550 --> 01:08:07,390
had like 3000 calories each. Great
conversation, great people. It's just,

1143
01:08:07,391 --> 01:08:12,040
it was awesome. All kinds of pictures
and that type of shit. And, uh,

1144
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:16,160
other than the fact I forgot my fucking
wallet because I decided to wear a suit

1145
01:08:16,161 --> 01:08:19,130
and I was going to be the big shot picking
up the fucking check and I had to go

1146
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:22,220
to my parents. So now, now, you know,

1147
01:08:22,221 --> 01:08:23,810
when a few days when I'd
take him to the airport,

1148
01:08:23,890 --> 01:08:26,600
I've got to give him the fucking money
back. But Oh god, it was embarrassing.

1149
01:08:26,690 --> 01:08:31,130
Really embarrassing. Um, so anyways,
that was my mother's Day. Uh,

1150
01:08:31,340 --> 01:08:32,480
go fuck yourselves.

1151
01:08:32,810 --> 01:08:37,810
I will check in on you on
Thursday and let's go predators.

1152
01:08:38,780 --> 01:08:43,230
And um, I don't know. I mean, I got
a bunch of friends. I, you know,

1153
01:08:43,330 --> 01:08:45,980
in Pittsburgh. I'm just rooting
for extra hockey at this point.

1154
01:08:45,981 --> 01:08:47,690
I hope both series go seven games.

1155
01:08:47,930 --> 01:08:51,860
I don't want to be this little fucking
Cunty Gargoyle shitting on the ducks.

1156
01:08:52,550 --> 01:08:54,380
I don't want to fucking
do that. You know, why?

1157
01:08:54,381 --> 01:08:58,400
Why do I gotta bring it to predators?
Success and then shit on Canadians fans,

1158
01:08:58,550 --> 01:08:59,060
you know,

1159
01:08:59,060 --> 01:09:02,150
all their pocket squares are all soaking
wet from them blowing the noses and

1160
01:09:02,151 --> 01:09:05,810
crying about losing to the
ranges. I don't need to do that.

1161
01:09:06,380 --> 01:09:09,740
Not to mention I have no bragging
rights. My team that fucking bounced out,

1162
01:09:10,580 --> 01:09:12,110
you know, I'm going to try to be a,

1163
01:09:12,111 --> 01:09:15,920
I'm gonna try to go cutlass for the
rest of the Stanley Cup playoffs.

1164
01:09:15,921 --> 01:09:18,830
How about that? Uh, Celtics
first, the Wiz, ease on down.

1165
01:09:18,831 --> 01:09:22,280
Ease on down the road tomorrow. Um,

1166
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:27,770
my brain says it could go either way,
but my heart says this no fucking way.

1167
01:09:28,910 --> 01:09:32,720
There's no way they come in to the
garden even though it's not the garden.

1168
01:09:33,290 --> 01:09:36,380
It's the fleets at the garden.

1169
01:09:36,381 --> 01:09:41,381
Fucking slash whatever fucking Gossett
jr whatever other fucking tags they have

1170
01:09:42,621 --> 01:09:45,650
for that thing. And uh, I just
don't see them doing, I feel like,

1171
01:09:46,370 --> 01:09:47,990
you know what it is to Celtics.

1172
01:09:48,320 --> 01:09:52,490
They got that sound in their crowd the
same way the Yank old Yankee stadium had

1173
01:09:52,491 --> 01:09:53,840
it, you know,

1174
01:09:53,900 --> 01:09:58,900
knowledgeable fans put a
history of success and they
that can push your team to

1175
01:10:00,621 --> 01:10:04,400
fucking win. And I think they're going
to do it. Oh, by the way, Derek Jeter.

1176
01:10:04,700 --> 01:10:07,430
Huh? I missed it. I was at Brunch.
I missed it. But that's a what?

1177
01:10:07,431 --> 01:10:10,520
A fucking class act, man.
He's such a class act.

1178
01:10:10,521 --> 01:10:13,080
He can go into New York and wing
his speech and still kill it.

1179
01:10:14,670 --> 01:10:15,503
Um,

1180
01:10:17,010 --> 01:10:21,530
that statement, they're artists,
single numbers. See if I can do it.

1181
01:10:21,800 --> 01:10:25,610
Billy Martin, number one. Number
two, Derek Jeter, number three,

1182
01:10:26,450 --> 01:10:28,490
Babe Ruth. Number four.
I was fucked this up.

1183
01:10:28,491 --> 01:10:31,310
That scared five is Dimaggio and six.

1184
01:10:31,311 --> 01:10:33,260
I looked up today cause that's
the one I always forgot,

1185
01:10:33,261 --> 01:10:36,200
but they said it was Joe Tory, but
I thought somebody else had six.

1186
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:39,773
Uh,

1187
01:10:40,660 --> 01:10:45,000
sevens. Mickey Mantle. Number
eight is fucking Yogi Baron.

1188
01:10:45,030 --> 01:10:49,780
Somebody else. Nine is Roger
Maris. 10 is Chris Chambliss.

1189
01:10:50,770 --> 01:10:55,180
11 is Gary Sheffield. I
don't know the rest of them.

1190
01:10:56,280 --> 01:11:00,760
Thurman Munson's 15, a little
store. I remember Reggie Jackson,

1191
01:11:00,820 --> 01:11:02,650
they added retires. That was 44.

1192
01:11:04,770 --> 01:11:07,710
A Bode Diaz with somebody.
What do you were 30?

1193
01:11:09,120 --> 01:11:12,960
I don't fucking know. All right, that's
it. That's the podcast. I will, uh,

1194
01:11:12,990 --> 01:11:17,580
I will check in on your Thursday. And
uh, God bless all the mothers out there.

1195
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,373
Okay.

1196
01:11:20,390 --> 01:11:22,640
Work with the family. Becky's
all alright, I'm done.
