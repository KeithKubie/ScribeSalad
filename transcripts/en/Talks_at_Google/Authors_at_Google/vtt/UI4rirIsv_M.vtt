[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:08.480
SPEAKER: Thank you guys
all for coming today.

00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:11.120
I would like to
present Ruth Whippman.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.720
We're here today to talk about
her book, "America the Anxious,

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:17.480
Why Our Search for Happiness
is Driving Us Crazy

00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:21.572
and How to Find It For Real."

00:00:21.572 --> 00:00:23.780
As a quick introduction,
Ruth is a British journalist

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:26.000
and has contributed pieces
to "The New York Times,"

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:27.416
"The Guardian,"
"The Independent,"

00:00:27.416 --> 00:00:28.970
and the "Huffington Post."

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:32.450
She previously worked for
BBC, where she was releasing

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:34.100
numerous documentaries.

00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:36.320
And in her book,
she examines what's

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.330
gone wrong with
American happiness,

00:00:38.330 --> 00:00:41.270
and why it is leading to such
an anxious, and ultimately,

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:44.302
unhappy society, and what
can be done about it.

00:00:44.302 --> 00:00:45.260
My name is [INAUDIBLE].

00:00:45.260 --> 00:00:47.540
I'm a long-time Googler.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:50.107
And yeah, so would you like to
tell us more about yourself.

00:00:50.107 --> 00:00:50.940
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Sure.

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:53.840
Yeah, well, we
moved to California

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.200
about six years ago from the
UK, and it was quite a culture

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:57.920
shock.

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.939
My background is in journalism.

00:00:59.939 --> 00:01:01.980
And do you want me to tell
you a bit more about--

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:02.990
SPEAKER: Yeah, please.

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:04.489
RUTH WHIPPMAN: --what
prompted me to write the book?

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:05.197
SPEAKER: Exactly.

00:01:05.197 --> 00:01:05.823
Yeah.

00:01:05.823 --> 00:01:07.680
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Well,
when we first got here,

00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:11.900
we came because my husband got
a job working in a tech startup.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.270
And it was quite a leap
into the dark for us.

00:01:14.270 --> 00:01:18.080
And I had given up my job in
journalism back in the UK.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:21.530
And every day he would shut
the door going off to work

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:24.650
and I'd have these 12
cavernous hours of time

00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:27.920
to fill before I could have
an adult conversation again.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.690
We had a young baby at the time.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:31.370
So I was putting
myself out there

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:34.970
and trying to meet as
many people as I could.

00:01:34.970 --> 00:01:36.590
Having lots of
random conversations

00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.020
with people at the dry
cleaners, and the grocery store,

00:01:39.020 --> 00:01:42.505
and in the park with my son.

00:01:42.505 --> 00:01:46.070
And I found very quickly
that this strange thing

00:01:46.070 --> 00:01:47.810
was happening.

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.510
I seemed to be having
the same conversation

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:52.100
over and over again.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:56.360
Different people,
different situations,

00:01:56.360 --> 00:01:58.730
different scenarios,
but the same topic

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.590
just kept on coming up.

00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.520
And this was some variation
on this theme of happiness.

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.100
And people were talking
about happiness almost

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.979
as a real source of
anxiety in their lives.

00:02:09.979 --> 00:02:13.580
People were asking these really
big questions of themselves.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:14.720
Am I happy?

00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:15.610
Am I happy enough?

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:18.419
Am I as happy as all my friends
that I see on social media?

00:02:18.419 --> 00:02:20.460
Could I be happier if I
was following my passion?

00:02:20.460 --> 00:02:22.040
But what is my passion?

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:22.540
All of this.

00:02:22.540 --> 00:02:24.470
And there seemed
to be this real gap

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:27.020
between what people expected
in terms of their happiness

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:31.420
and how happy they
actually were feeling.

00:02:31.420 --> 00:02:33.497
And so I was prompted--

00:02:33.497 --> 00:02:36.080
I was really fascinated and it
was a real cultural difference,

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:39.410
because I think in the UK
happiness is a little bit

00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:40.310
suspect.

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:46.010
You don't want to show too many
overt signs of being too happy.

00:02:46.010 --> 00:02:48.000
So I wanted to look into it.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.430
And what I found was that--

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:54.500
you would think, given the kind
of cultural focus on happiness

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:57.110
here in the States, and the
amount of money and time

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.780
and effort that people
put into becoming happier,

00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.630
you would think Americans
would be the happiest people

00:03:02.630 --> 00:03:03.440
on the planet.

00:03:03.440 --> 00:03:06.985
But statistically, they
actually rank very, very far

00:03:06.985 --> 00:03:08.110
down the list of happiness.

00:03:08.110 --> 00:03:10.520
So that was my starting
point for writing this book.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:12.740
I just wanted to find out
why, what's going wrong,

00:03:12.740 --> 00:03:17.950
and how we can find out what
really makes for a happy life.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:18.590
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:20.690
One thing you define
it in the book

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:23.870
almost like a rat
race for happiness.

00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:25.820
What did you mean
by that exactly?

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.653
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:03:26.653 --> 00:03:28.850
I mean the expression that
happiness-- rat race--

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:32.000
came to me when people
would talk about happiness

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.590
almost in the same
way that people

00:03:33.590 --> 00:03:35.332
talk about going on a diet.

00:03:35.332 --> 00:03:37.040
There's not much
pleasure involved in it.

00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:40.580
But if I just read this book,
and do this meditation app,

00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:42.060
and go to this--

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:44.450
write in my gratitude
journal, and be more mindful,

00:03:44.450 --> 00:03:48.260
and be more positive, and be
more this, then I can be happy.

00:03:48.260 --> 00:03:51.841
And it felt like it was
really a lot of hard work--

00:03:51.841 --> 00:03:52.340
happiness.

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:54.824
There wasn't much
pleasure involved in it.

00:03:54.824 --> 00:03:56.990
SPEAKER: And something
that's interesting-- you have

00:03:56.990 --> 00:03:58.364
had all these
experiences, you've

00:03:58.364 --> 00:04:00.950
talked to all these people
who seem to be filling

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:03.667
their life with all these
measures to become happier,

00:04:03.667 --> 00:04:05.250
but when you look
at it statistically,

00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.690
the United States may be one
of the least happy countries,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:10.400
and also our happiness
levels really

00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.590
haven't changed in
quite some time.

00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:13.670
That's correct, right?

00:04:13.670 --> 00:04:14.545
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Right.

00:04:14.545 --> 00:04:18.200
So when you look at the
actual data on this,

00:04:18.200 --> 00:04:23.870
despite spending more time,
and money, and emotional energy

00:04:23.870 --> 00:04:27.309
in trying to become
happier, compared

00:04:27.309 --> 00:04:28.850
to other developed
nations, Americans

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.750
are some of the least happy
people in the Western world.

00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:35.690
And actually, there was a study
that came out a year or so ago,

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:38.570
which actually put the
day-to-day contentment

00:04:38.570 --> 00:04:42.890
of people in the US at
two places behind Rwanda.

00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:45.080
I mean if you just think
about that for a moment,

00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.180
Rwanda is a country
that suffered

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:50.930
a major collective
psychological trauma, but yet

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:54.470
people there are rating as more
content than American office

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:55.400
workers.

00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:57.470
So that really
was a paradox that

00:04:57.470 --> 00:04:59.810
made me want to know
more and find out

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:01.100
what was going wrong exactly.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.960
SPEAKER: And are
there key differences

00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:06.860
that you noticed specifically
for moving from the UK

00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:09.860
to the United States?

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:12.420
Whatever that was.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.120
RUTH WHIPPMAN: I
think that there

00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.215
are a lot of differences
in the way that people

00:05:16.215 --> 00:05:17.090
talk about happiness.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.220
I think there's a
real focus in the US.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:21.710
And I think this is a
good thing in many ways.

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:25.790
But there is a real
valuing of people

00:05:25.790 --> 00:05:28.880
being positive-- people being
cheerful and positive all

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:30.320
the time and appearing happy.

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.620
Being happy and also looking
happy to everybody else.

00:05:32.620 --> 00:05:34.560
And don't be a downer
and everything.

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:36.440
And I think in the
UK, maybe people

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.640
are a little bit more jaded.

00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:41.330
And actually being
negative is almost part

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:43.520
of the culture in a way.

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:47.870
It's not expected that people
would have such a high level

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.740
of happiness all the time.

00:05:49.740 --> 00:05:52.890
And people don't go after it
in quite such a relentless way,

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:53.792
I think.

00:05:53.792 --> 00:05:56.000
SPEAKER: So let's take a
step back then and then talk

00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.050
about the book for a second.

00:05:57.050 --> 00:05:57.380
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Sure.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:59.660
SPEAKER: Could you give
us a brief quick outline--

00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:01.730
I found it really
interesting how you went

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:04.440
about examining this rat race.

00:06:04.440 --> 00:06:06.950
Could you give us a brief
outline of what you did?

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:07.783
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:09.830
So I did lots of
different things.

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.000
I spent a lot of time--

00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.830
I sampled quite a few of
the self-help offerings

00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:17.360
that people are selling.

00:06:17.360 --> 00:06:19.490
And I realized self-help
in this country

00:06:19.490 --> 00:06:21.380
is a multibillion
dollar industry.

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:26.290
A lot of money is changing hands
in this pursuit of happiness

00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:28.700
and this idea that we
can control our happiness

00:06:28.700 --> 00:06:30.440
and make ourselves happier.

00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:31.854
So I did the Landmark forum.

00:06:31.854 --> 00:06:33.770
I don't know if any of
you have heard of that,

00:06:33.770 --> 00:06:40.310
but it's a very popular
self-help weekend,

00:06:40.310 --> 00:06:43.670
four-day course that's
incredibly intense.

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.520
And I went through everything
on the spectrum of emotion

00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.850
while I was doing that
from sheer terror,

00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:53.840
to depression, to anxiety,
to joy, to all of it.

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:56.810
I spent time with--

00:06:56.810 --> 00:07:01.120
I went to Las Vegas
where I spent time in--

00:07:01.120 --> 00:07:03.640
Tony Hsieh, who is
the CEO of Zappos,

00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:07.060
the shoe retailer-- he has
a happiness city almost,

00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:09.200
that he's set up in
downtown Las Vegas.

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:10.630
He's bought up a
whole lot of land

00:07:10.630 --> 00:07:15.010
and is running it as a happiness
community based on principles

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:19.390
of positive psychology and
on the idea that you can

00:07:19.390 --> 00:07:20.890
maximize people's happiness.

00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:23.890
And that was a very
strange place to be.

00:07:23.890 --> 00:07:26.930
And I spent time
with Mormons in Utah.

00:07:26.930 --> 00:07:29.350
The Mormons actually
rate, statistically,

00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:32.200
as the happiest
people in America.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.990
And but actually what makes
this slightly more complex

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:36.760
is that they also
have the highest

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:38.230
rate of anti-depressant use.

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:42.090
So I was trying to unpick
what was going on there.

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:43.990
And I looked at the
workplace-- some trends

00:07:43.990 --> 00:07:46.140
in happiness engineering
in the workplace.

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:48.990
I looked at parenting,
social media.

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:51.610
And I spent some time looking
at the academic research

00:07:51.610 --> 00:07:54.190
on happiness, which frankly
was the most joyless part

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.020
of the whole endeavor.

00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.090
Academic studies on happiness
are really quite dry.

00:08:00.090 --> 00:08:03.250
SPEAKER: And so in listening
and reading the book,

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:07.150
it was really interesting to see
how you jumped from one topic

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.930
to the next in this overall
vision of what you perceive

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:14.170
the United States to be in terms
of this pursuit for happiness.

00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:15.940
Which one of those
experiences did you

00:08:15.940 --> 00:08:18.834
find to be the most revealing?

00:08:18.834 --> 00:08:20.750
RUTH WHIPPMAN: That's
an interesting question.

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:23.930
I mean, I think, it's
hard to pick one.

00:08:23.930 --> 00:08:26.140
I mean going to spend
some time at the Downtown

00:08:26.140 --> 00:08:31.270
Project in the Las Vegas thing
that I was talking about where

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:35.500
this very, very wealthy tech
billionaire has brought people

00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:39.336
from all over the United States
to live in this community

00:08:39.336 --> 00:08:40.419
and work as entrepreneurs.

00:08:40.419 --> 00:08:42.909
And there's this kind of
semi-communal living a lot

00:08:42.909 --> 00:08:45.820
of it, where people live
and work in the same place

00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.930
and they've maximized happiness
by putting the buildings

00:08:49.930 --> 00:08:51.850
in certain places
in the square--

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:53.320
how many people per square foot.

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.450
And everything is so planned.

00:08:55.450 --> 00:08:58.110
And one of the really
kind of shocking things

00:08:58.110 --> 00:09:00.610
was in this so-called
happiness community,

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:02.830
they ended up having one
of the highest suicide

00:09:02.830 --> 00:09:04.800
rates in the United States.

00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:08.710
So I mean, that was a very
dark and awful tragic,

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.540
but also fascinating.

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:12.380
And I think it
had partly to do--

00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:14.140
and a lot of the people
that were saying--

00:09:14.140 --> 00:09:16.570
that it partly had to do
with this extreme pressure

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:18.790
to be happy all the time.

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:21.820
That I think really
stressed people out.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:23.930
And that was the thing
that I kept coming back to.

00:09:23.930 --> 00:09:24.240
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:26.448
I think it's an interesting
topic too for discussion,

00:09:26.448 --> 00:09:29.830
because in the tech world a lot
of what we're discussing today

00:09:29.830 --> 00:09:32.050
is how can the
internet of things

00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:33.655
influence your surroundings.

00:09:33.655 --> 00:09:36.310
So if whether it's your home
or whether it's the city itself

00:09:36.310 --> 00:09:39.700
that you live in, how can
being surrounded by technology

00:09:39.700 --> 00:09:44.530
create a more fruitful
life, a happier life?

00:09:44.530 --> 00:09:46.750
From your experience
was that something

00:09:46.750 --> 00:09:50.490
that was relevant to the time
that you spent in Downtown?

00:09:50.490 --> 00:09:53.230
Was technology ever present
and did it cause more happiness

00:09:53.230 --> 00:09:55.660
or was it rather something
else that caused people

00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:57.907
to commit suicide?

00:09:57.907 --> 00:09:59.340
[LAUGHS]

00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.690
RUTH WHIPPMAN: I mean all of
these things are quite complex.

00:10:02.690 --> 00:10:04.810
I mean the Downtown Project--

00:10:04.810 --> 00:10:07.060
I mean there was a slight
sense at the beginning

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.070
that they were going
to use happiness--

00:10:09.070 --> 00:10:12.310
that they were going to use
technology even more to monitor

00:10:12.310 --> 00:10:13.060
where people went.

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.560
And they had this
idea that everyone

00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.280
was going to wear a
wristband to measure

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:18.190
how many social
interactions they had

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.420
and how happy they were.

00:10:19.420 --> 00:10:21.100
And this technology
actually exists.

00:10:21.100 --> 00:10:22.015
I mean, I found--

00:10:22.015 --> 00:10:23.890
they weren't actually
using these wrist bands

00:10:23.890 --> 00:10:25.265
in the Downtown
Project, but they

00:10:25.265 --> 00:10:27.640
do use them in many companies.

00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:29.860
This has become something
that your boss can monitor

00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.660
how happy you are, and
how productive you are,

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.100
and how the two
relate to each other.

00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:34.891
And there is something
very big brother-ish

00:10:34.891 --> 00:10:36.712
and sinister about that.

00:10:36.712 --> 00:10:38.170
I mean, I think in
terms of the way

00:10:38.170 --> 00:10:40.660
that most people use
technology and the internet--

00:10:40.660 --> 00:10:42.220
I mean it's no one thing.

00:10:42.220 --> 00:10:44.270
I mean technology is
what you make of it.

00:10:44.270 --> 00:10:46.090
And I think there's
good and bad in that.

00:10:46.090 --> 00:10:47.430
I mean I looked at social media.

00:10:47.430 --> 00:10:49.430
It was a big thing
that I looked at.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:52.300
And I think that can
bring its own anxieties.

00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.380
I think it raises
the expectations.

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.870
It's the way that we
use social media now--

00:10:56.870 --> 00:11:00.220
Instagram, Facebook-- trying
to make our lives look--

00:11:00.220 --> 00:11:02.530
it was almost like a
personal PR project--

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:04.490
your Facebook profile,
and how happy you look,

00:11:04.490 --> 00:11:06.276
and here I am having
so much fun in all

00:11:06.276 --> 00:11:07.400
these different situations.

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:11.330
And I think that in itself has
raised the stakes for anxiety

00:11:11.330 --> 00:11:12.220
for many of us.

00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.469
SPEAKER: One of the things
that I really laughed about

00:11:14.469 --> 00:11:17.131
and I found it so
relevant to my life was--

00:11:17.131 --> 00:11:17.630
two things.

00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.004
First and foremost,
you're right,

00:11:19.004 --> 00:11:21.860
social media becomes this PR--

00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:24.080
it really it is your brand
in its own respective.

00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:25.850
But then you also
mention in your book

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:29.090
that it's also creating a
sanitized version of your life

00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:29.590
to a degree.

00:11:29.590 --> 00:11:30.465
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Right.

00:11:30.465 --> 00:11:31.270
Right.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:32.650
SPEAKER: And maybe
even replacing

00:11:32.650 --> 00:11:35.195
some interpersonal communication
you have with other people.

00:11:35.195 --> 00:11:36.070
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Right.

00:11:36.070 --> 00:11:37.778
I mean, it's kind of
become an arms race.

00:11:37.778 --> 00:11:40.086
And I think we all do
it to a certain extent.

00:11:40.086 --> 00:11:41.710
And I find myself
doing it, even having

00:11:41.710 --> 00:11:43.600
written a book about this.

00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:45.640
I find myself doing
the same thing.

00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:50.800
Like, for instance, I
took my kids apple-picking

00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.960
in a local orchard recently.

00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.550
And frankly, the day
was kind of miserable.

00:11:55.550 --> 00:11:57.490
I mean we did--

00:11:57.490 --> 00:12:00.040
the kids were whining the
whole time, it was really hot,

00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:03.040
everybody was bored, the
apples were all mushy.

00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:08.320
And then the photo that ended
up on Facebook of this day--

00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.150
the one probably millisecond
in the entire day

00:12:11.150 --> 00:12:12.660
when everyone was
smiling and posing

00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:14.745
and whenever-- that's
what ended up there.

00:12:14.745 --> 00:12:16.862
And anyone looking
at that thing would

00:12:16.862 --> 00:12:19.070
have thought oh, Ruth, what
a great day she's having.

00:12:19.070 --> 00:12:21.490
And I wish my life
was like that.

00:12:21.490 --> 00:12:25.110
Meanwhile, I'm just thinking
oh, thank god that's over.

00:12:25.110 --> 00:12:28.510
And it's the way that
we curate our lives now,

00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.270
I think it does give a very
unrepresentative picture

00:12:31.270 --> 00:12:33.240
of what happiness looks like.

00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.420
And I think that is adding
to this anxiety of my life

00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:41.890
really should be like this and
somewhere here and this gap.

00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:43.120
SPEAKER: That's very true.

00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:45.790
One thing I wanted to
touch upon was really

00:12:45.790 --> 00:12:48.770
diving into your experiences
with the self-help community.

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:51.167
The Landmark forum is the
pinnacle one in your book.

00:12:51.167 --> 00:12:53.500
Then there's a few other ones
at some elementary schools

00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.610
as well.

00:12:54.610 --> 00:12:58.030
And you do a really
good job of just bashing

00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:00.850
on these forums
and these pundits

00:13:00.850 --> 00:13:05.950
and just really
examining in a crude way,

00:13:05.950 --> 00:13:08.200
almost how they're
swindling people.

00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:09.980
What do you think
from what you saw

00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.600
attracted people to the forum
and then also to even re-up

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:15.105
and say, I'll do level 2.

00:13:15.105 --> 00:13:15.980
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Right.

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.560
Well, I mean, this thing it's--

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:21.640
I mean I think that
naturally the type of people

00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.560
who are attracted
to self-help tend

00:13:23.560 --> 00:13:25.450
to be in the more
vulnerable end of things.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:27.700
I mean, you don't go
on a self-help course

00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:29.290
when your life is
already brilliant.

00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:31.600
So you're already
dealing with people

00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.800
who have issues and problems.

00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.810
And this is a business.

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:37.330
I mean there is a lot
of money changing hands.

00:13:37.330 --> 00:13:39.280
And it is in these
people's interest

00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:42.190
to get as much money as
possible, which is not

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:44.500
to say that everybody in
the self-help industry

00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.974
is some kind of
charlatan or fraudster

00:13:46.974 --> 00:13:48.890
or whatever that's trying
to steal your money.

00:13:48.890 --> 00:13:52.980
But I think there is an
element of that in this thing.

00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:54.410
And I think the
Landmark forum is

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:56.900
a very, very intense program.

00:13:56.900 --> 00:14:00.580
I mean, you're in this room,
it's a conference room,

00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.960
and you're there
for very long hours,

00:14:02.960 --> 00:14:04.650
you have very limited breaks.

00:14:04.650 --> 00:14:07.295
And it's till 10
o'clock at night

00:14:07.295 --> 00:14:09.170
and you're just getting
all this information.

00:14:09.170 --> 00:14:11.600
And everybody is sharing
these incredibly dark moments

00:14:11.600 --> 00:14:14.880
from their lives and you
feel very, very vulnerable.

00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.880
And then they come in at
just the crucial moment

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:19.505
and say, well, maybe you'd like
to sign up for the next course.

00:14:19.505 --> 00:14:22.139
And you're weeping about
you've had a terrible childhood

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:23.930
or whatever, and you're
like, OK, whatever,

00:14:23.930 --> 00:14:27.636
whatever, I'll pay
whatever it takes.

00:14:27.636 --> 00:14:30.080
It was a very powerful
emotional experience

00:14:30.080 --> 00:14:33.020
being there and not
necessarily for the good.

00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:34.057
That's for sure.

00:14:34.057 --> 00:14:35.390
SPEAKER: Was there ever a time--

00:14:35.390 --> 00:14:37.010
because I imagine in
researching this book,

00:14:37.010 --> 00:14:38.810
you wanted to get as much
information as you could.

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.680
Was there ever a time
where you're like,

00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:42.170
I don't want to go to
another self-help forum and--

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.440
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:42.710
[LAUGHS]

00:14:42.710 --> 00:14:44.420
SPEAKER: --but you
forced yourself to do so.

00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.253
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:14:45.253 --> 00:14:48.950
I mean it's funny that when
it came to the Landmark forum

00:14:48.950 --> 00:14:51.472
I actually did the Landmark
forum before the book.

00:14:51.472 --> 00:14:52.680
It went the other way around.

00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:53.790
And that was one of the things--

00:14:53.790 --> 00:14:55.800
everyone had told me do
this thing, it's amazing,

00:14:55.800 --> 00:14:57.841
it's amazing, amazing,
amazing, you've got to go.

00:14:57.841 --> 00:14:59.960
And it was almost
the other way around.

00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:03.410
I did the forum
thinking just because I

00:15:03.410 --> 00:15:04.610
wanted to be happier--

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:07.090
I was kind of lonely
in my new country--

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:08.990
and I went and that
was part of what

00:15:08.990 --> 00:15:11.360
led to the book rather
than the other way around.

00:15:11.360 --> 00:15:15.110
But yeah, I did a lot
of this mindfulness

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.390
workshops, I did meditation,
I did various things.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.550
And a lot of the time I
did this sort of thing,

00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:21.820
and I thought oh,
gosh, not another one.

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:24.320
But at the same time, I wanted
to be open to these things.

00:15:24.320 --> 00:15:25.986
I didn't want to start
from the position

00:15:25.986 --> 00:15:30.240
that this is all a load
of rubbish and just--

00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.157
I wanted to see what actually
worked and what didn't.

00:15:34.157 --> 00:15:35.990
SPEAKER: And you bring
up a good point, too.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.720
And that the majority
of people that are maybe

00:15:38.720 --> 00:15:41.960
going to a self-help forum or
reading a book about self-help

00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.780
are in actual need
of help or rather

00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:46.794
are seeking some
kind of answers.

00:15:46.794 --> 00:15:48.460
From the people that
you interacted with

00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:50.780
and people that
you met, did they

00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:52.950
find answers in these books?

00:15:52.950 --> 00:15:55.840
Did they experience some
kind of transformation?

00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.840
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Well, I
think a lot of people do.

00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:00.119
I mean, there's an atmosphere,
like a tent revival

00:16:00.119 --> 00:16:01.160
in a lot of these places.

00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:03.200
Where it's like oh, yes,
and everyone gets whipped up

00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:04.241
into this kind of frenzy.

00:16:04.241 --> 00:16:07.010
And then the most successful
people in this industry

00:16:07.010 --> 00:16:09.780
are the people who can
really prey on those emotions

00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:12.350
and whip people
up into a frenzy.

00:16:12.350 --> 00:16:14.390
And I think people do
feel very transformed,

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:17.240
but then one of the
depressing statistics

00:16:17.240 --> 00:16:20.810
is that the most likely
customer of a self-help book

00:16:20.810 --> 00:16:22.880
is somebody who's bought
another self-help book

00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:24.810
within the last 18 months.

00:16:24.810 --> 00:16:26.660
So there's obviously
something where

00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:29.210
people get on a kind of spiral
and none of these things

00:16:29.210 --> 00:16:32.680
are actually providing quite
the answers that the people are

00:16:32.680 --> 00:16:33.260
hoping for.

00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.051
And I think you raised
an interesting point

00:16:35.051 --> 00:16:37.230
when you said, these are
people who need help.

00:16:37.230 --> 00:16:39.070
There's something about
in this whole idea--

00:16:39.070 --> 00:16:41.930
so it's a very American
idea in a way, this idea

00:16:41.930 --> 00:16:44.810
that happiness is something
that we can control.

00:16:44.810 --> 00:16:49.640
That self-help rather than
helping others, or that help

00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.540
should be provided
from some other source,

00:16:51.540 --> 00:16:52.915
so that you are
entitled to help.

00:16:52.915 --> 00:16:55.340
It's like go out and help
yourself and pull yourself up

00:16:55.340 --> 00:16:57.680
by your bootstraps and
make yourself happier.

00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.930
I don't know if you've ever
seen these memes that say,

00:16:59.930 --> 00:17:01.910
happiness is a choice.

00:17:01.910 --> 00:17:03.380
It's quite a common phrase here.

00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:04.819
It's almost like if you don't--

00:17:04.819 --> 00:17:08.329
it's your responsibility
to make yourself happier,

00:17:08.329 --> 00:17:10.660
which can be quite anxiety
inducing in itself.

00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:12.784
SPEAKER: And that's definitely
an interesting point

00:17:12.784 --> 00:17:15.230
you bring up in the book,
which is that in America it

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:19.550
seems that we're really seeking
happiness and isolation.

00:17:19.550 --> 00:17:22.800
And is that starkly different
from your experiences

00:17:22.800 --> 00:17:24.275
not having lived in the country?

00:17:24.275 --> 00:17:26.316
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Well, so
this is one of the things

00:17:26.316 --> 00:17:29.660
that I kept coming back
to in my research, which

00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.510
is that pretty much every
piece of research that's ever

00:17:34.510 --> 00:17:37.390
been done into human
happiness and no matter

00:17:37.390 --> 00:17:40.270
how much all these studies
all contradict themselves

00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.550
in other ways,
there is one factor

00:17:42.550 --> 00:17:46.150
that we know is the single
biggest cause of happiness.

00:17:46.150 --> 00:17:49.150
And that is our social
connections, our relationships

00:17:49.150 --> 00:17:50.600
with other people.

00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.160
But yet, the self-help industry
and our conception of happiness

00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:57.010
is moving more and more and more
towards being about the self.

00:17:57.010 --> 00:18:00.970
And a lot of the activities
that we're taking part in now,

00:18:00.970 --> 00:18:04.480
like meditation, like
mindfulness, like yoga, they're

00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.930
all about having a very
private emotional experience,

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:11.540
about looking within your
soul, and being internal,

00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:13.210
rather than external.

00:18:13.210 --> 00:18:15.214
And I think that's one
of the real problems.

00:18:15.214 --> 00:18:17.380
I think that was one of the
key findings that really

00:18:17.380 --> 00:18:19.360
made me think, OK,
this might be where

00:18:19.360 --> 00:18:20.995
we're going slightly wrong.

00:18:20.995 --> 00:18:23.620
And I think it's a trend that's
true in other Western countries

00:18:23.620 --> 00:18:24.120
as well.

00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:26.920
We are living increasingly
isolated lives.

00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:32.140
But I think in America, there's
a very individualistic culture

00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.840
and I think that our
approach to happiness

00:18:34.840 --> 00:18:37.534
is me in my happiness journey
and my quest for happiness

00:18:37.534 --> 00:18:38.950
and how can I make
myself happier,

00:18:38.950 --> 00:18:41.687
which is probably going about
it in slightly the wrong way.

00:18:41.687 --> 00:18:43.270
SPEAKER: I found it
really fascinating

00:18:43.270 --> 00:18:46.030
to listen to the stories
that you'd bring up.

00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:49.180
Specifically, around yoga and
meditation, how people would be

00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:51.670
say doing four or five yoga
classes a week to try and get

00:18:51.670 --> 00:18:55.890
that sense of fulfillment and
happiness and mindfulness.

00:18:55.890 --> 00:18:58.450
And it opened a door to
maybe a different world

00:18:58.450 --> 00:18:59.452
than I would see.

00:18:59.452 --> 00:19:01.660
Because I don't know many
friends that are doing yoga

00:19:01.660 --> 00:19:02.000
on a day-to-day--

00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:02.270
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Doing so much.

00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:04.410
SPEAKER: --basis much,
in order to feel content

00:19:04.410 --> 00:19:06.970
or in order to build
that happiness.

00:19:06.970 --> 00:19:09.605
From what you saw, do
you think that maybe--

00:19:09.605 --> 00:19:11.980
I don't know if extreme is
the right word, but were there

00:19:11.980 --> 00:19:16.097
extreme examples of the seeking
out of people's happiness.

00:19:16.097 --> 00:19:16.930
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:19.227
I mean, I don't want to
give the wrong impression

00:19:19.227 --> 00:19:21.560
that I think that yoga is the
cause of all the problems.

00:19:21.560 --> 00:19:21.730
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:21.730 --> 00:19:23.110
We're not talking about that,
because obviously that's

00:19:23.110 --> 00:19:23.890
not true.

00:19:23.890 --> 00:19:25.870
But I think it's about
a kind of mindset.

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:29.470
I think California is
the world headquarters

00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.110
of self-actualisation, isn't it?

00:19:31.110 --> 00:19:33.910
So I think the things that you
see here in California maybe

00:19:33.910 --> 00:19:36.640
are a little more extreme
than you would see elsewhere.

00:19:36.640 --> 00:19:40.310
But these trends do hold
true across the country.

00:19:40.310 --> 00:19:42.970
You think about Oprah and
the influence that she's had.

00:19:42.970 --> 00:19:45.430
And it's all about my
personal happiness journey

00:19:45.430 --> 00:19:48.950
and my own responsibility
for my happiness.

00:19:48.950 --> 00:19:55.810
And a lot of these they hold
yoga mindfulness meditation.

00:19:55.810 --> 00:19:58.710
What I've come to think of
is the spiritual industrial

00:19:58.710 --> 00:19:59.210
complex.

00:19:59.210 --> 00:20:02.600
I mean that is worth about
$20 billion to the economy.

00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:05.320
I mean, it's a lot of
money changing hands here.

00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:08.000
It's very popular.

00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:09.940
SPEAKER: So these
self-help forums,

00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:12.730
these self-help books
are to a degree useful,

00:20:12.730 --> 00:20:16.480
but maybe they don't hold
all the answers for us.

00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.050
From your research, what do
you think could lead Americans

00:20:20.050 --> 00:20:21.466
to a happier life?

00:20:21.466 --> 00:20:22.840
RUTH WHIPPMAN:
Well, I think that

00:20:22.840 --> 00:20:25.214
what I found just again and
again and again, whether that

00:20:25.214 --> 00:20:29.620
was through the field work or
the academic staff or whatever.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:32.320
It's that the key
to happiness really

00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.080
is in relationships
and other people.

00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.880
And you know I say
this all the time.

00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.340
And one of the most common
responses that I get

00:20:39.340 --> 00:20:41.710
is people say, well,
that's fair enough,

00:20:41.710 --> 00:20:44.650
but that doesn't apply to
me, because I'm an introvert

00:20:44.650 --> 00:20:49.220
and I hate other people, and I'd
rather just sit in my basement

00:20:49.220 --> 00:20:50.910
and never talk to anyone.

00:20:50.910 --> 00:20:54.070
But actually, all the
research supports the fact

00:20:54.070 --> 00:20:57.460
that the importance
of social connection

00:20:57.460 --> 00:21:00.970
is just as true and
important for introverts

00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:02.020
as it is for extroverts.

00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.300
It might manifest in a
slightly different way.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.790
It might not be going
to lots of huge parties

00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:08.650
and being the
center of attention.

00:21:08.650 --> 00:21:14.170
But still the importance of
having supportive relationships

00:21:14.170 --> 00:21:15.110
is just--

00:21:15.110 --> 00:21:18.010
and also it's not just for our
happiness, it's for our health.

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:22.810
Low social connection
or loneliness

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.140
carries with it a risk
of premature death

00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:28.400
comparable to that of smoking.

00:21:28.400 --> 00:21:30.340
And it's about
twice as dangerous

00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:33.980
to be lonely as
it is to be obese.

00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.670
And you think how much money
and effort we put into dieting

00:21:36.670 --> 00:21:40.720
and not being obese, when
actually here's an answer which

00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:42.000
is so important right there?

00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:42.820
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:21:42.820 --> 00:21:45.730
There was an interesting part
at the end of the book talking

00:21:45.730 --> 00:21:47.470
about the genetic
component of happiness

00:21:47.470 --> 00:21:51.130
and how you have this
biological marker of where

00:21:51.130 --> 00:21:54.490
you're going to always be happy
and then you can have variance.

00:21:54.490 --> 00:21:56.410
Was there ever any
information or studies

00:21:56.410 --> 00:22:00.380
that you found that showed
maybe that that fulfillment

00:22:00.380 --> 00:22:02.470
and that biological marker
could be tweaked up.

00:22:02.470 --> 00:22:04.520
Not necessarily change
at the baseline,

00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.370
but social interactions
or the things

00:22:06.370 --> 00:22:08.080
that made that marker move up--

00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.610
I don't even know if it's
measurable to be honest.

00:22:09.610 --> 00:22:09.910
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:22:09.910 --> 00:22:11.760
I mean, I think there's been
various ways to measure it.

00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:13.390
And I think that
people generally

00:22:13.390 --> 00:22:16.270
agree that there's a big
genetic component to happiness.

00:22:16.270 --> 00:22:17.980
So people have a
happiness set point

00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:23.400
that they keep returning to, but
you can work around it a bit.

00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:25.960
Where the whole positive
psychology movement

00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:28.930
has become slightly political,
slightly ideological,

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:33.560
is that it very much downplays
the idea of circumstances

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:35.670
on our happiness, and
very much plays up

00:22:35.670 --> 00:22:37.800
the idea of individual control.

00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:41.030
So there's a lot of
research now and a lot of it

00:22:41.030 --> 00:22:46.800
is funded by a very right
wing biased organization.

00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:49.226
This belief that we can--

00:22:49.226 --> 00:22:50.600
it's this bootstraps
idea that we

00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:53.690
can make ourselves happier
by trying all this stuff

00:22:53.690 --> 00:22:55.020
and it's your responsibility.

00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:56.519
And if you're not
happy, it's almost

00:22:56.519 --> 00:22:59.900
like it is your own fault. And
downplays all these factors

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:05.180
like income, race, social
class, social projects.

00:23:05.180 --> 00:23:07.360
Which actually is
not a fair reading.

00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:10.000
I believe it's based on a
very, very flawed reading

00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.440
of the data, and
actually circumstances

00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.160
do make a huge difference.

00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.490
SPEAKER: So maybe an
open-ended question is,

00:23:16.490 --> 00:23:18.470
we have all these
things-- we have yoga,

00:23:18.470 --> 00:23:20.807
we have meditation to
build mindfulness--

00:23:20.807 --> 00:23:22.640
religion is something
that you discussed too

00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:25.190
and that religious people
are statistically more happy,

00:23:25.190 --> 00:23:28.480
but maybe in real life those
statistics don't necessarily

00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:30.470
hit on the actual reality.

00:23:30.470 --> 00:23:35.030
With all of these
things, how do they

00:23:35.030 --> 00:23:37.262
get built into a happy
life while also maintaining

00:23:37.262 --> 00:23:38.220
the social connections?

00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:39.170
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Well,
the religion thing

00:23:39.170 --> 00:23:41.086
that you just mentioned
is really interesting,

00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:45.260
because across the world
it's pretty robust finding

00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.000
that religious people
do rate as happier

00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.800
than non-religious people.

00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:51.650
And I think the
temptation is to think

00:23:51.650 --> 00:23:55.070
that that is because people
have this private belief in God

00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.820
and this certainty that things
will be OK because there's

00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:00.110
an afterlife or whatever.

00:24:00.110 --> 00:24:03.050
But when you
control for the fact

00:24:03.050 --> 00:24:07.024
that religious people have
much greater number and quality

00:24:07.024 --> 00:24:08.690
of social connections--
when you control

00:24:08.690 --> 00:24:10.815
for that in the studies,
the difference disappears.

00:24:10.815 --> 00:24:13.580
So actually, the reason
why religious people

00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.290
tend to rate as happier
than other people

00:24:15.290 --> 00:24:17.990
is because they have such a
strong sense of community,

00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:19.340
generally.

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:21.590
And when I went to spend
time with Mormons in Utah

00:24:21.590 --> 00:24:22.940
that was a huge finding.

00:24:22.940 --> 00:24:24.580
I was staying with
a Mormon family

00:24:24.580 --> 00:24:26.330
and we were sitting
there for half an hour

00:24:26.330 --> 00:24:27.205
in their living room.

00:24:27.205 --> 00:24:29.480
And I think 10
different people stopped

00:24:29.480 --> 00:24:32.270
by for drop off some
cookies or a cup of tea--

00:24:32.270 --> 00:24:33.950
not a cup of tea,
they don't drink tea,

00:24:33.950 --> 00:24:35.980
but that's my
Britishness talking.

00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:40.010
But whatever, a
drink or something.

00:24:40.010 --> 00:24:42.350
So I think it is that
sense of community that

00:24:42.350 --> 00:24:45.710
really is at the
heart of why religion

00:24:45.710 --> 00:24:48.770
does make people happier.

00:24:48.770 --> 00:24:52.640
SPEAKER: And so maybe a
point for the audience

00:24:52.640 --> 00:24:55.600
as guardians of
technology at Google

00:24:55.600 --> 00:24:58.410
and arbiters of new things,
what recommendations

00:24:58.410 --> 00:25:03.470
would you have to us as we
build technology for people?

00:25:03.470 --> 00:25:06.190
From what you've seen
in terms of happiness,

00:25:06.190 --> 00:25:08.280
and one of the key things
that we say at Google

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:11.011
is build something that
someone would love to use.

00:25:11.011 --> 00:25:12.510
Almost like a
toothbrush experiences

00:25:12.510 --> 00:25:14.420
is one thing-- it's that
you want them to use it

00:25:14.420 --> 00:25:16.378
every single day, because
they love it so much,

00:25:16.378 --> 00:25:17.210
it's so useful.

00:25:17.210 --> 00:25:20.769
When we're building these things
what should we be considering?

00:25:20.769 --> 00:25:21.560
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Wow.

00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:22.476
That's a big question.

00:25:22.476 --> 00:25:23.830
[LAUGHTER]

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:28.460
If I knew that, I'd be making
a lot more money than I am now.

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:31.352
I think technology
is competitive,

00:25:31.352 --> 00:25:33.560
because it can be a force
for connection and bringing

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.470
people together and it can also
be a force for isolating people

00:25:36.470 --> 00:25:38.960
as well and keeping people
locked in their own smartphone

00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:39.860
and not--

00:25:39.860 --> 00:25:45.942
I mean this is not Google, but
I remember one of these moments

00:25:45.942 --> 00:25:47.900
when I was researching
this book and I thought,

00:25:47.900 --> 00:25:50.090
oh my god, this is the
end of civilization,

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:54.881
was when I downloaded a
happiness app to my phone.

00:25:54.881 --> 00:25:56.630
And I went on to the
app store and there's

00:25:56.630 --> 00:25:59.300
a 1,000 different options
for happiness apps

00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:03.830
that you can download,
that will send you

00:26:03.830 --> 00:26:07.210
pictures of sunsets, and
puppies, and beaches.

00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:08.960
And there was this one
that would send you

00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.520
pictures of your
own loved ones, so

00:26:10.520 --> 00:26:12.460
that you could sit
looking at your phone,

00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.376
scrolling through pictures
of your loved ones,

00:26:14.376 --> 00:26:17.147
while presumably your actual
loved ones are looking

00:26:17.147 --> 00:26:18.230
at pictures of you, maybe.

00:26:18.230 --> 00:26:18.771
I don't know.

00:26:18.771 --> 00:26:20.089
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:20.089 --> 00:26:21.880
And I remember there
was this one time when

00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:24.170
the one I downloaded
actually would send you

00:26:24.170 --> 00:26:26.237
these positive
affirmations every hour

00:26:26.237 --> 00:26:28.820
or so throughout the day and you
were supposed to repeat them.

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:32.450
So it was, I am beautiful or I
am enough, or whatever it was.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:35.960
And I remember the problem
was every time my phone buzzed

00:26:35.960 --> 00:26:37.620
when I got a message
from this thing,

00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:41.630
I'd get that Pavlovian jolt of
ooh, someone sent me a message,

00:26:41.630 --> 00:26:42.140
great.

00:26:42.140 --> 00:26:43.973
Somebody wants to go
out and meet for coffee

00:26:43.973 --> 00:26:46.390
or it's a friend or whatever.

00:26:46.390 --> 00:26:48.985
And then it would
say, I am enough.

00:26:48.985 --> 00:26:49.610
[LAUGHTER]

00:26:49.610 --> 00:26:51.026
And I'd think I
just want to throw

00:26:51.026 --> 00:26:53.900
the phone across the thing,
because the whole point is

00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:54.800
I am not enough.

00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:57.350
And I think if we are
really looking to an app

00:26:57.350 --> 00:27:01.581
to make us happy then
something has gone wrong.

00:27:01.581 --> 00:27:03.080
SPEAKER: And that's
hit a little bit

00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.840
on the research you did
around social media.

00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:08.420
Have you found that at
least in your research

00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.160
that a lot of
people have replaced

00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.860
those in-person connections,
those interpersonal connections

00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:14.486
with your phone, with
your application?

00:27:14.486 --> 00:27:15.318
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:27:15.318 --> 00:27:16.910
I think there's
quite good evidence

00:27:16.910 --> 00:27:18.680
to show that that has
definitely happened.

00:27:18.680 --> 00:27:21.459
And especially,
for the millennials

00:27:21.459 --> 00:27:23.000
and younger generation,
I think there

00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.910
is a lot of concern
over the fact

00:27:25.910 --> 00:27:27.680
that people are
replacing real world

00:27:27.680 --> 00:27:33.537
interactions with online ones,
smartphone things for sure.

00:27:33.537 --> 00:27:34.120
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:27:34.120 --> 00:27:35.745
Well, I think we're
going to open it up

00:27:35.745 --> 00:27:39.060
to questions in the audience
and as well as on the Dory.

00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:41.620
[INAUDIBLE] if you're
still in the room--

00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.780
I think he has a mike
that he can pass around.

00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.650
RUTH WHIPPMAN: I think
someone had one over here.

00:27:47.650 --> 00:27:52.900
AUDIENCE: Hey, so one of the
topics that you pointed out

00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:55.720
regarding this whole stress
of trying to be happy

00:27:55.720 --> 00:27:59.480
is the whole self-help
community and whatever.

00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:03.730
But also the other thing
that I'm curious about

00:28:03.730 --> 00:28:06.750
is what about the
contribution of the family.

00:28:06.750 --> 00:28:08.710
Because one other thing I see--

00:28:08.710 --> 00:28:11.620
I could be wrong,
but my understanding

00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:16.060
is also we are in this trend
where probably the kids are

00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:19.420
being pampered or this
whole notion of having

00:28:19.420 --> 00:28:23.200
any kind of negative emotion is
like oh, something is extremely

00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:26.090
wrong, rather than just teaching
them it's just part of life.

00:28:26.090 --> 00:28:30.250
And you need to just go
through it and teach them

00:28:30.250 --> 00:28:31.230
how to handle it.

00:28:31.230 --> 00:28:33.910
So how much is that
also contributing

00:28:33.910 --> 00:28:35.950
in creating
generations of people

00:28:35.950 --> 00:28:39.766
who are probably extremely
confused about what is right?

00:28:39.766 --> 00:28:41.390
RUTH WHIPPMAN: It's
an excellent point.

00:28:41.390 --> 00:28:44.880
I actually write a whole
chapter about parenting--

00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:47.302
sorry, have I lost
my thing here?

00:28:47.302 --> 00:28:49.040
Sorry.

00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:49.540
Yeah.

00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:52.630
I write a whole chapter in
the book about parenting

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.400
and exactly what
you're describing.

00:28:54.400 --> 00:28:56.650
I think there's
this-- in the same way

00:28:56.650 --> 00:29:00.100
that there is this feeling
that we can force ourselves

00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:01.570
to be happy with
enough hard work,

00:29:01.570 --> 00:29:04.300
there's also a parallel
feeling that we can build

00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:06.010
this perfectly happy child.

00:29:06.010 --> 00:29:08.680
That if we just make
every moment magical

00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:10.630
and we take away
every negative sense

00:29:10.630 --> 00:29:13.330
and every negative emotion,
prioritize positivity

00:29:13.330 --> 00:29:15.775
above all else, then
we will turn out

00:29:15.775 --> 00:29:16.930
these perfectly happy kids.

00:29:16.930 --> 00:29:19.690
And it's backfiring
really badly.

00:29:19.690 --> 00:29:21.925
I mean some of the
examples that I came across

00:29:21.925 --> 00:29:24.400
when writing the book were
actually quite ridiculous

00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:26.255
and humorous.

00:29:26.255 --> 00:29:28.630
There was this one thing I
was so shocked by when I first

00:29:28.630 --> 00:29:32.450
moved here was that a friend
of mine left her 2-year-old,

00:29:32.450 --> 00:29:32.950
I think--

00:29:32.950 --> 00:29:35.950
2 and 1/2 year old-- with
another mom, while she

00:29:35.950 --> 00:29:37.540
went to run some errands.

00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:42.820
And this woman, the other woman,
breastfed this friend's child.

00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.865
this friend's 2-year-old
because she was crying.

00:29:45.865 --> 00:29:47.990
It was this feeling
that this child

00:29:47.990 --> 00:29:50.320
can't be distressed
for one moment

00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.570
without someone stepping out--

00:29:51.570 --> 00:29:53.930
I mean that's a very
extreme example.

00:29:53.930 --> 00:29:57.970
But I think there is this
data that we've become or--

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.464
I'm a parent and I know
that I'm part of this,

00:30:00.464 --> 00:30:01.880
and it's hard to
get away from it.

00:30:01.880 --> 00:30:03.921
But yeah, we have become
these helicopter parents

00:30:03.921 --> 00:30:07.060
who are micro-managing
our kids' lives.

00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.630
And then the evidence is
showing that kids in college

00:30:10.630 --> 00:30:13.900
now are actually suffering some
really serious mental health

00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:14.890
problems.

00:30:14.890 --> 00:30:18.274
Severe levels of anxiety,
depression, lack of resilience,

00:30:18.274 --> 00:30:19.190
those kinds of things.

00:30:19.190 --> 00:30:22.559
And I think those trends
are related for sure.

00:30:22.559 --> 00:30:23.059
Thanks.

00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.180
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:30:27.180 --> 00:30:30.450
I took a class at Google
called search inside yourself

00:30:30.450 --> 00:30:33.034
about a year ago.

00:30:33.034 --> 00:30:34.950
I don't know if you call
it a self-help class,

00:30:34.950 --> 00:30:37.230
it does include some meditation.

00:30:37.230 --> 00:30:40.200
But I think the biggest
takeaway I had from it

00:30:40.200 --> 00:30:45.000
was a piece of advice that was
don't aim for a happy life, aim

00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:46.950
for a meaningful life.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:48.810
So is that something
that you found is you

00:30:48.810 --> 00:30:51.680
should look for meaning, instead
of looking for happiness?

00:30:51.680 --> 00:30:52.770
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah, so
I think it's really--

00:30:52.770 --> 00:30:54.186
I mean I haven't
done that course,

00:30:54.186 --> 00:30:56.740
so I can't speak to exactly
what was discussed there.

00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.194
I think meaning is
obviously really important

00:30:59.194 --> 00:31:01.610
and I think connection is the
thing that's most important.

00:31:01.610 --> 00:31:04.395
I think in a way there's
this trend where meaning

00:31:04.395 --> 00:31:05.640
has become the new happiness.

00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:07.514
Everyone's texting
meaning, meaning, meaning,

00:31:07.514 --> 00:31:09.930
and then it loses its meaning,
because what is meaning.

00:31:09.930 --> 00:31:11.790
I mean, meaning is
something that is

00:31:11.790 --> 00:31:12.998
different to everything else.

00:31:12.998 --> 00:31:15.930
And I think when there's
this MacGuffin, this thing

00:31:15.930 --> 00:31:18.360
that we're all supposed
to chase after, then it

00:31:18.360 --> 00:31:19.440
becomes its own rat race.

00:31:19.440 --> 00:31:24.084
But yes, I think you're
right in that it's

00:31:24.084 --> 00:31:26.250
important to see what things
have value in our lives

00:31:26.250 --> 00:31:28.950
and just for happiness to
be a byproduct of our lives.

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.070
And living a connected,
meaningful life,

00:31:32.070 --> 00:31:34.945
rather than chasing after
happiness specifically.

00:31:42.070 --> 00:31:42.895
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:31:42.895 --> 00:31:44.520
You touched upon
briefly the connection

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.230
between religious
people being more happy

00:31:46.230 --> 00:31:47.460
because of social gatherings.

00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:49.590
Could you elaborate a bit
more on that correlation,

00:31:49.590 --> 00:31:51.182
what exactly causes that?

00:31:51.182 --> 00:31:52.890
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Why
does social connection

00:31:52.890 --> 00:31:53.400
cause religious people--

00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.440
AUDIENCE: No, how religious
people become happy because

00:31:55.440 --> 00:31:56.750
of their social gatherings?

00:31:56.750 --> 00:31:57.642
RUTH WHIPPMAN: --because of
their social connections.

00:31:57.642 --> 00:31:58.141
Yeah.

00:31:58.141 --> 00:32:00.660
Well, I think that there's
lots of research that

00:32:00.660 --> 00:32:04.590
shows that people who have
a religious affiliation

00:32:04.590 --> 00:32:08.700
spend more time socializing
and being part of a community.

00:32:08.700 --> 00:32:12.960
And it's not necessarily that
they go on more dinner dates

00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:15.840
or whatever, but it is that
if you have a religious place

00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:18.030
where you go every week--

00:32:18.030 --> 00:32:21.070
if you go to church or a mosque
or a synagogue or whatever--

00:32:21.070 --> 00:32:22.590
that's very much
based on community.

00:32:22.590 --> 00:32:24.720
And it's based on this
shared understanding

00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:26.887
that people are responsible
for each other's welfare

00:32:26.887 --> 00:32:28.553
and people will look
out for each other.

00:32:28.553 --> 00:32:30.460
Not every religious
community is like that,

00:32:30.460 --> 00:32:32.580
but I think that's a baseline.

00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:34.080
And so people-- and
there's research

00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:35.746
that shows that people
who are religious

00:32:35.746 --> 00:32:37.860
are more likely to do
things like give blood,

00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:41.970
and more likely to be
involved in community events,

00:32:41.970 --> 00:32:45.130
to have more social events
per week than other people.

00:32:45.130 --> 00:32:47.857
And I think that's why when you
control for that, when you take

00:32:47.857 --> 00:32:50.190
that out of the equation,
then actually religious people

00:32:50.190 --> 00:32:52.482
aren't any happier
than anybody else.

00:32:52.482 --> 00:32:53.190
AUDIENCE: Got it.

00:32:53.190 --> 00:32:53.730
Thank you.

00:32:53.730 --> 00:32:55.030
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Thanks.

00:32:55.030 --> 00:32:57.280
AUDIENCE: So hey,
thanks for coming.

00:32:57.280 --> 00:32:59.580
So you've been talking all
about the happiness aspect,

00:32:59.580 --> 00:33:02.090
but you also mentioned
the term self-actualized.

00:33:02.090 --> 00:33:03.900
And I was curious
of your perspective

00:33:03.900 --> 00:33:06.412
on how you view the
difference between those two.

00:33:06.412 --> 00:33:10.860
And to the point about a life
of trying to find meaning,

00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:14.286
but about an effort to try and
get to better know yourself

00:33:14.286 --> 00:33:16.000
through that
self-actualized review.

00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:16.833
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:33:16.833 --> 00:33:20.370
So I think it's about balance,
because obviously getting

00:33:20.370 --> 00:33:23.490
to know who you are
and becoming the best

00:33:23.490 --> 00:33:25.940
self that you can be-- all of
those things are important.

00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:28.362
And to work out
who you are and how

00:33:28.362 --> 00:33:30.320
to work with that, that's
very, very important.

00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:31.903
But I think what's
happened in America

00:33:31.903 --> 00:33:35.400
is that the balance has
somehow got out of whack.

00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.380
So we're putting
self-actualisation

00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.150
above connection.

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.961
So the idea is that we engineer
happiness from the inside out.

00:33:42.961 --> 00:33:45.210
That if you can perfectly
know yourself and understand

00:33:45.210 --> 00:33:45.380
yourself--

00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:47.088
I don't know if you've
heard this phrase,

00:33:47.088 --> 00:33:48.340
happiness comes from within.

00:33:48.340 --> 00:33:52.650
It's actually impossible to
get a result on a Google search

00:33:52.650 --> 00:33:55.399
that tells you the
opposite, because I typed it

00:33:55.399 --> 00:33:56.190
in that happiness--

00:33:56.190 --> 00:33:57.390
I was going to do some--

00:33:57.390 --> 00:33:59.765
at one point I was thinking
of doing some slides for this

00:33:59.765 --> 00:34:02.310
and I typed in meme
happiness comes from within.

00:34:02.310 --> 00:34:06.030
You got 1,000 results of all
these different memes saying

00:34:06.030 --> 00:34:07.380
variations on this.

00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:09.480
If you type in meme
in an image search,

00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.310
happiness comes
from other people,

00:34:11.310 --> 00:34:14.190
every single result seemingly or
at least on the front page that

00:34:14.190 --> 00:34:16.760
comes back says, happiness does
not come from other people,

00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:17.926
happiness comes from within.

00:34:17.926 --> 00:34:20.219
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:20.219 --> 00:34:22.639
And it's almost
like-- and so I think

00:34:22.639 --> 00:34:24.170
the balance has got wrong.

00:34:24.170 --> 00:34:26.260
So I'm not saying
that people should not

00:34:26.260 --> 00:34:28.480
try to understand themselves,
reflect on themselves,

00:34:28.480 --> 00:34:28.980
all of that.

00:34:28.980 --> 00:34:30.389
That's obviously
important, but I

00:34:30.389 --> 00:34:34.469
think the emphasis has
gone wrong somewhere.

00:34:34.469 --> 00:34:36.659
I think if we make
connection and other people

00:34:36.659 --> 00:34:38.889
are starting point
and then throw

00:34:38.889 --> 00:34:40.500
in a bit of
self-actualization, rather

00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:44.652
than having the balance
so skewed the other way.

00:34:44.652 --> 00:34:45.600
Thanks.

00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:46.427
Oh, hey.

00:34:46.427 --> 00:34:48.510
AUDIENCE: So you were
talking about the importance

00:34:48.510 --> 00:34:49.969
of social connections.

00:34:49.969 --> 00:34:51.810
I think there are two
types I can imagine.

00:34:51.810 --> 00:34:53.909
First, there are, for
example, close friends

00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:56.280
who I spend a lot of
time interacting with

00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:57.600
and I have deep connection.

00:34:57.600 --> 00:35:00.070
And then there are just
people I barely know.

00:35:00.070 --> 00:35:03.000
So it's just hard to
have many close friends,

00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:04.859
because it takes a lot of time.

00:35:04.859 --> 00:35:06.900
But you can have a lot of
people you barely know.

00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:11.124
Is there any distinction which
type of relationships is more--

00:35:11.124 --> 00:35:12.540
what's the difference
between them

00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.970
and how do they influence
happiness in different ways?

00:35:14.970 --> 00:35:17.040
Close relationships
and more meaningful

00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:18.690
or just know as
many people you can?

00:35:18.690 --> 00:35:20.460
[LAUGHTER]

00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:22.479
RUTH WHIPPMAN: So both
are actually important,

00:35:22.479 --> 00:35:23.020
surprisingly.

00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:24.900
So it goes without
saying, I think,

00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.000
that close friendships
and really supportive

00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.950
relationships are more
important than the women who

00:35:29.950 --> 00:35:33.760
sells you your newspaper
in the morning or whatever.

00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:38.460
And that's really the key is
focusing on a few very close

00:35:38.460 --> 00:35:40.085
supportive relationships.

00:35:40.085 --> 00:35:41.490
But there is pretty
good evidence

00:35:41.490 --> 00:35:44.960
to show that having lots of--

00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:47.550
there is a technical term
for it-- but small social

00:35:47.550 --> 00:35:48.340
connections also.

00:35:48.340 --> 00:35:49.900
And being part of
a wider community

00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:51.720
and feeling invested
in a community

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.050
also has a big impact on
our happiness as well.

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:58.380
So just feeling that
we're part of something

00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:01.430
bigger than ourselves, I think.

00:36:01.430 --> 00:36:03.150
So I think in
aggregate it might not

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.316
be that every single one
of those little connections

00:36:05.316 --> 00:36:08.070
really is that meaningful,
but overall, I think

00:36:08.070 --> 00:36:09.700
they can make a big difference.

00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:11.310
SPEAKER: And I thought there
was an interesting point

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:13.470
in the book, not to give
too many details away,

00:36:13.470 --> 00:36:17.460
but you quote Thomas Jefferson
and the pursuit of happiness.

00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:19.800
And your interpretation
it's not so much

00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:22.110
pursuing this inward
happiness, which

00:36:22.110 --> 00:36:24.780
is perfected from all
my self-actualization,

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.385
but rather pursuing
a happiness which

00:36:27.385 --> 00:36:29.010
makes you part of a
community and makes

00:36:29.010 --> 00:36:30.260
you part of that larger whole.

00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:31.051
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yes.

00:36:31.051 --> 00:36:33.657
I mean, I think that's pretty
clear that the founding fathers

00:36:33.657 --> 00:36:36.240
weren't really thinking about a
self-help workshop when they--

00:36:36.240 --> 00:36:36.970
[LAUGHTER]

00:36:36.970 --> 00:36:38.850
I mean, that's taking
it to an extreme.

00:36:38.850 --> 00:36:42.090
But yes, they were talking about
civic engagement and community

00:36:42.090 --> 00:36:46.386
and that was very much being
part of a larger thing.

00:36:46.386 --> 00:36:47.967
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:36:47.967 --> 00:36:48.800
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:49.880
Hi.

00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.380
AUDIENCE: One more.

00:36:52.380 --> 00:36:56.012
I wonder if you upon writing
your book, if you touch on that

00:36:56.012 --> 00:36:58.220
or what would you think
about-- or if you've noticed,

00:36:58.220 --> 00:37:01.050
I'm not from here either.

00:37:01.050 --> 00:37:04.730
And I wonder if you
noticed that there

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:09.850
seems to be some bragging
around mentioning or just

00:37:09.850 --> 00:37:12.500
even implying that you're busy.

00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:17.480
And people-- I find it very hard
here to just call a friend up

00:37:17.480 --> 00:37:19.110
and say, hey, are
you up for a beer?

00:37:19.110 --> 00:37:20.720
It's almost
virtually impossible.

00:37:20.720 --> 00:37:23.780
And where I come from,
it's like we're adults,

00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:26.740
we have these lives,
but it's just easier.

00:37:26.740 --> 00:37:31.090
And I have almost become
that myself too, where--

00:37:31.090 --> 00:37:33.340
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Everything
is great and wonderful idea.

00:37:33.340 --> 00:37:36.400
AUDIENCE: --And the kids,
and I work full time.

00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.690
And so yeah, it's also
hard for me sometimes.

00:37:38.690 --> 00:37:41.530
But I get the sense
too, sometimes

00:37:41.530 --> 00:37:44.630
that I feel this inner pride
of saying, well, no I'm busy,

00:37:44.630 --> 00:37:47.470
and tonight can't
make it work or not.

00:37:47.470 --> 00:37:49.670
And I'm like, yeah,
I'm a busy person.

00:37:49.670 --> 00:37:51.170
And then I'm like,
I feel like shit.

00:37:51.170 --> 00:37:55.280
I haven't had a beer in
a long time with anyone.

00:37:55.280 --> 00:37:56.347
And I don't know.

00:37:56.347 --> 00:37:57.180
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:37:57.180 --> 00:37:59.600
I mean it's so easy to
put just socializing down

00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:02.240
to the absolute bottom of
the priority list, isn't it?

00:38:02.240 --> 00:38:04.640
I mean, if you have a full
time job, you work hard--

00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:05.599
I think, there's this--

00:38:05.599 --> 00:38:07.390
I mean, we didn't
actually talk about this,

00:38:07.390 --> 00:38:09.660
but it's something that
I touched on in the book.

00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:12.250
That now what used to be
called work-life balance,

00:38:12.250 --> 00:38:14.810
they're now calling
work-life integration,

00:38:14.810 --> 00:38:16.345
which just makes my heart sink.

00:38:16.345 --> 00:38:17.988
[LAUGHTER]

00:38:17.988 --> 00:38:20.749
This seems to be more work.

00:38:20.749 --> 00:38:22.790
That you have to have your
phone on all the time,

00:38:22.790 --> 00:38:24.380
that you are answerable,
you're always on the clock.

00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:26.546
And that we're merging all
these parts of our lives.

00:38:26.546 --> 00:38:29.840
So there's very little
socializing or communicating

00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:33.645
or whatever with friends
that is totally free of work

00:38:33.645 --> 00:38:35.270
and free of
responsibilities in the way

00:38:35.270 --> 00:38:37.240
that perhaps it used to be.

00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:39.560
And I mean there's
this really chilling--

00:38:39.560 --> 00:38:41.789
I thought chilling
statistic, which is the--

00:38:41.789 --> 00:38:44.330
I don't know if you've heard of
the American time use survey,

00:38:44.330 --> 00:38:46.490
but they just categorize
how people literally spend

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:48.480
every moment of their day.

00:38:48.480 --> 00:38:51.110
And every activity
that you can think

00:38:51.110 --> 00:38:53.600
of-- working, sleeping,
driving, having sex, whatever--

00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.240
is all categorized.

00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:57.200
And there's a category
on the survey called

00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:59.340
socializing and communicating.

00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.180
And it doesn't just
cover the good stuff.

00:39:01.180 --> 00:39:03.002
So it's not just the
lovely heart to heart

00:39:03.002 --> 00:39:04.460
that you have with
your best friend

00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:07.190
or this adoring conversation
with your boyfriend

00:39:07.190 --> 00:39:08.030
or girlfriend.

00:39:08.030 --> 00:39:10.340
It's all the arguing, the
nagging, the bitching,

00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.950
the whining, everything,
all thrown in together.

00:39:12.950 --> 00:39:15.820
So as long as there's more
than one adult present

00:39:15.820 --> 00:39:18.884
and it's not an incidental
part of something else.

00:39:18.884 --> 00:39:20.300
Does anyone want
to hazard a guess

00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:22.940
how much time we spent
on that category per day,

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.750
the average American?

00:39:26.750 --> 00:39:28.670
AUDIENCE: 30 minutes.

00:39:28.670 --> 00:39:29.640
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:39:29.640 --> 00:39:31.140
It's about 30 minutes a day.

00:39:31.140 --> 00:39:37.590
So put another way, we know this
is the single most important

00:39:37.590 --> 00:39:39.690
pillar of our
happiness, but yet we

00:39:39.690 --> 00:39:42.450
spend 23 and 1/2 hours
out of every day not

00:39:42.450 --> 00:39:46.180
doing that, doing something
completely different.

00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:47.610
So I found that pretty scary.

00:39:50.590 --> 00:39:51.090
Hi.

00:39:51.090 --> 00:39:53.780
AUDIENCE: Thanks for your talk.

00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:56.320
Did you happen to see the
article in "The New York Times

00:39:56.320 --> 00:39:58.210
Magazine" this last weekend?

00:39:58.210 --> 00:39:59.930
It was called, "The
Kids Who Can't."

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.480
Which is like a mean title.

00:40:01.480 --> 00:40:02.980
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Oh,
I don't think so.

00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:05.170
AUDIENCE: It was about
anxiety with millennials,

00:40:05.170 --> 00:40:08.690
and especially, the
youngest millennials.

00:40:08.690 --> 00:40:11.464
It was saying that-- it was
talking about this phenomenon.

00:40:11.464 --> 00:40:12.880
So first of all,
I wondered if you

00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:14.296
came across this
in your research,

00:40:14.296 --> 00:40:16.422
anxiety being a bigger
problem with younger people?

00:40:16.422 --> 00:40:17.212
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yes.

00:40:17.212 --> 00:40:17.950
Definitely.

00:40:17.950 --> 00:40:20.750
AUDIENCE: And then have any
guesses of how to explain it,

00:40:20.750 --> 00:40:23.320
it mentioned the social media
phenomenon, which I think

00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:25.480
is right on the money
and you touched on that.

00:40:25.480 --> 00:40:28.560
But another thing it
talked about was how--

00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:32.380
I don't love this word, but it
said that the youngest people

00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.946
are being coddled in the
sense that it's common now

00:40:34.946 --> 00:40:36.820
if a kid is feeling
anxious that they're just

00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.670
allowed to stay home from
school or that they have

00:40:39.670 --> 00:40:42.610
their own dedicated
entrance to avoid

00:40:42.610 --> 00:40:44.817
the stressors of the
main entrance at school.

00:40:44.817 --> 00:40:46.900
And that was one of the
ideas that was put forward

00:40:46.900 --> 00:40:49.990
as to why this is actually
having a negative effect

00:40:49.990 --> 00:40:52.610
and keeping them in
this spiral of anxiety.

00:40:52.610 --> 00:40:54.530
So I wondered what you
thought about that?

00:40:54.530 --> 00:40:54.820
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:40:54.820 --> 00:40:56.153
I think that's absolutely right.

00:40:56.153 --> 00:40:58.140
I mean, and I notice
it in myself as well.

00:40:58.140 --> 00:40:59.020
I have two kids.

00:40:59.020 --> 00:41:05.920
And my oldest son, he goes to
this drama group on a Thursday,

00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.589
and he decided he doesn't like
it and he doesn't want to go.

00:41:09.589 --> 00:41:11.380
And that he's got some
anxiety around that.

00:41:11.380 --> 00:41:14.160
And instantly I think,
ooh, we've got to stop,

00:41:14.160 --> 00:41:15.165
he doesn't have to go.

00:41:15.165 --> 00:41:16.540
Why should he have
to go to that?

00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.206
And it's very easy to think--

00:41:19.206 --> 00:41:21.080
and I was about to pull
him out of this thing

00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:22.930
and I go what on
earth am I doing?

00:41:22.930 --> 00:41:26.152
I mean, and I look back at
my childhood and probably

00:41:26.152 --> 00:41:29.110
a good 70%, 80% of the
stuff that I didn't really

00:41:29.110 --> 00:41:31.930
want to be doing that much
and nobody was suggesting

00:41:31.930 --> 00:41:34.100
that I would not be
doing it because of that.

00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.070
And there's a
balance and whatever.

00:41:36.070 --> 00:41:39.220
And I think it is good that we
consider kids' feelings more

00:41:39.220 --> 00:41:41.630
now and that we
consider their emotions

00:41:41.630 --> 00:41:43.020
and treat them as important.

00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:44.241
And I do think that.

00:41:44.241 --> 00:41:46.740
But absolutely, I think there
is this tendency and this idea

00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:49.180
that everything has to be
magical and wonderful for kids

00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.380
and that we remove negative
experiences from their path.

00:41:53.380 --> 00:41:57.245
That is very damaging for sure.

00:41:57.245 --> 00:41:58.330
AUDIENCE: How you doing?

00:41:58.330 --> 00:41:59.112
Thanks for coming.

00:41:59.112 --> 00:42:00.570
So my question
actually in relation

00:42:00.570 --> 00:42:02.040
to that right there along
with the gentleman's

00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.440
question over here about
sharing the connection and also

00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:05.520
time usage.

00:42:05.520 --> 00:42:07.730
So you talk about the sense
of community obviously

00:42:07.730 --> 00:42:10.650
and to go along with these
younger generations being

00:42:10.650 --> 00:42:14.130
a little more hyperactive or
stuck in these social media

00:42:14.130 --> 00:42:15.770
and everything.

00:42:15.770 --> 00:42:19.166
It seems to be a stereotype of
millennials that they're ADD,

00:42:19.166 --> 00:42:21.040
they can't keep their
attention for anything.

00:42:21.040 --> 00:42:24.420
So this idea of fragmentation
of not only your work and life

00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:27.110
balance and everything, but
also your personal interests.

00:42:27.110 --> 00:42:31.200
Do you find any correlation
between simplification

00:42:31.200 --> 00:42:34.740
or really focusing on a
specific interest of yours

00:42:34.740 --> 00:42:36.840
in regards to this
idea of having

00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.910
too many communities
or too many friendships

00:42:38.910 --> 00:42:40.860
that you don't actually get the
value out of it that you might?

00:42:40.860 --> 00:42:42.270
Or is there a threshold
or correlation

00:42:42.270 --> 00:42:44.610
to this idea that some of
these less developed countries

00:42:44.610 --> 00:42:46.770
have less things to worry
about-- not necessarily

00:42:46.770 --> 00:42:47.970
less things to worry about
and very important things

00:42:47.970 --> 00:42:50.280
to worry about-- but this
idea that maybe they're just

00:42:50.280 --> 00:42:52.350
not over-exerting where
their interests lie

00:42:52.350 --> 00:42:54.757
and trying to do too much
or have too many communities

00:42:54.757 --> 00:42:55.840
to really get invested in.

00:42:55.840 --> 00:42:57.548
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah,
and too much choice.

00:42:57.548 --> 00:43:00.665
And I think we live in this
very consumerist world where

00:43:00.665 --> 00:43:02.790
we have so much choice for
everything all the time.

00:43:02.790 --> 00:43:04.664
And I think that can
sometimes be paralyzing.

00:43:04.664 --> 00:43:07.320
That if you can be anything--

00:43:07.320 --> 00:43:09.900
if we are all told, be
whatever you want to be,

00:43:09.900 --> 00:43:14.250
follow your passion, find your
path, you can do anything.

00:43:14.250 --> 00:43:18.240
I think sometimes you think,
oh my god, I can't do anything,

00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:23.070
because it's just the
expectation is so high of what

00:43:23.070 --> 00:43:24.870
happiness should look like.

00:43:24.870 --> 00:43:28.800
And so many choices, so
many demands on our time

00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:30.320
and attention, I
think absolutely

00:43:30.320 --> 00:43:31.654
that it can be quite paralyzing.

00:43:31.654 --> 00:43:33.570
AUDIENCE: Yeah, sorry,
just a quick follow-up.

00:43:33.570 --> 00:43:35.250
Meaning, more
specifically, do you

00:43:35.250 --> 00:43:37.050
think that there's
value in trying

00:43:37.050 --> 00:43:39.030
to find a few
interests, as opposed

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.140
to just diversifying that a bit?

00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:41.970
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Lots
of different things?

00:43:41.970 --> 00:43:42.270
That's interesting.

00:43:42.270 --> 00:43:42.960
Yeah, I don't know.

00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:44.501
I didn't look into
that specifically,

00:43:44.501 --> 00:43:47.240
but I think that probably
depends on the individual

00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:47.740
as well.

00:43:47.740 --> 00:43:51.030
I think some people really have
a very deep and abiding passion

00:43:51.030 --> 00:43:53.820
for one thing and that
really brings them happiness

00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.247
and meaning to follow that.

00:43:55.247 --> 00:43:57.330
And other people will try
lots of different things

00:43:57.330 --> 00:43:58.540
throughout the course of life.

00:43:58.540 --> 00:43:59.400
And same with friendships.

00:43:59.400 --> 00:44:01.350
I think somebody over
here asked about-- you

00:44:01.350 --> 00:44:04.962
asked about is it one
handful of close friends

00:44:04.962 --> 00:44:06.670
or is it knowing lots
and lots of people.

00:44:06.670 --> 00:44:09.640
And I think that is to do
with individual personality,

00:44:09.640 --> 00:44:13.190
really what it comes down to.

00:44:13.190 --> 00:44:14.280
SPEAKER: Cool.

00:44:14.280 --> 00:44:16.420
Any more live questions?

00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.600
If not, we can go to
the Dory for one or two.

00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.935
AUDIENCE: We have one
more live question.

00:44:22.935 --> 00:44:24.340
Hi.

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:25.775
I was actually
curious about what

00:44:25.775 --> 00:44:29.780
you found when you were
researching about meditation.

00:44:29.780 --> 00:44:32.660
Because I actually, I'm like
a natural born cynic generally

00:44:32.660 --> 00:44:34.370
when it comes to
things like this.

00:44:34.370 --> 00:44:37.580
But I went to a talk here
actually last month--

00:44:37.580 --> 00:44:40.340
this guy named Daniel Gorman.

00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:43.190
And it was really interesting
and actually skewed me

00:44:43.190 --> 00:44:45.650
towards--

00:44:45.650 --> 00:44:47.390
he came with a neuroscientist.

00:44:47.390 --> 00:44:49.340
And they basically
had done research

00:44:49.340 --> 00:44:53.460
where meditation and this
practice of mindfulness--

00:44:53.460 --> 00:44:57.440
there was data done where they
looked at the brains of monks

00:44:57.440 --> 00:45:01.710
and it showed that it
actually decreased stress

00:45:01.710 --> 00:45:03.070
and there was just--

00:45:03.070 --> 00:45:04.190
SPEAKER: And that's
actually the same book

00:45:04.190 --> 00:45:05.255
we were talking about before.

00:45:05.255 --> 00:45:05.670
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah, before.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:06.000
Yeah.

00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:06.645
AUDIENCE: "Altered Traits?"

00:45:06.645 --> 00:45:06.910
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:45:06.910 --> 00:45:07.767
"Altered Traits."

00:45:07.767 --> 00:45:09.350
AUDIENCE: And so I
guess I was curious

00:45:09.350 --> 00:45:11.841
in your own findings, this is--

00:45:11.841 --> 00:45:13.340
RUTH WHIPPMAN: So
this is a really--

00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:17.144
this has been one of the most
controversial things actually--

00:45:17.144 --> 00:45:18.560
this whole thing
about meditation.

00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:20.900
Every time I ever
bring up meditation,

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:23.030
I get a million emails
from angry meditators

00:45:23.030 --> 00:45:25.071
all over the world wanting
to run me out of town.

00:45:25.071 --> 00:45:26.040
[LAUGHTER]

00:45:26.040 --> 00:45:28.640
So I think there's
a few things there.

00:45:28.640 --> 00:45:30.620
I think neuroscience is
much more complicated

00:45:30.620 --> 00:45:33.120
than popular neuroscience
would allow us to believe.

00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.950
So when we say, something
changes the brain,

00:45:35.950 --> 00:45:38.450
it sounds amazingly
impressive, but pretty much

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:40.400
everything we do
changes the brain.

00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.430
So from going to the bathroom
or to just sitting here

00:45:43.430 --> 00:45:45.170
now to hearing your questions.

00:45:45.170 --> 00:45:46.770
Everything we do
changes the brain,

00:45:46.770 --> 00:45:48.930
because that's the
nature of the brain.

00:45:48.930 --> 00:45:50.990
But so meditation and
mindfulness-- there

00:45:50.990 --> 00:45:53.120
have been many
thousands of studies

00:45:53.120 --> 00:45:55.220
done into the effects
of these things.

00:45:55.220 --> 00:46:00.960
And the results have been, I
would say from my experience,

00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:03.240
that not that there are no
effects of these things,

00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:05.120
but they have been quite
strongly over-hyped.

00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:06.500
So there was a
meta-analysis that

00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:09.680
came out a year
or two ago, which

00:46:09.680 --> 00:46:12.920
looked at all of these studies
and found that out of something

00:46:12.920 --> 00:46:16.550
like 1,800 studies,
only 40 of them

00:46:16.550 --> 00:46:18.470
actually had a controlled
comparison group.

00:46:18.470 --> 00:46:20.496
So I don't know how much
people know about how

00:46:20.496 --> 00:46:21.620
these kind of studies work.

00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:24.422
But comparing a
group of people who

00:46:24.422 --> 00:46:26.630
meditates to a group of
people who don't do anything,

00:46:26.630 --> 00:46:30.161
isn't really a fair
comparison because there's so

00:46:30.161 --> 00:46:31.910
many other factors
that could be going on.

00:46:31.910 --> 00:46:33.284
There could be
placebo effect, it

00:46:33.284 --> 00:46:37.220
could be the effect of having
a social connection, whatever.

00:46:37.220 --> 00:46:40.490
When meditation is compared
to a control group where

00:46:40.490 --> 00:46:42.380
they are doing
something comparable,

00:46:42.380 --> 00:46:46.230
a reasonable control group,
meditation performs no better

00:46:46.230 --> 00:46:50.420
and often worse than
something like exercise,

00:46:50.420 --> 00:46:55.100
listening to spiritual
audiotapes, any kind of sham

00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.070
control where you're
just putting something

00:46:58.070 --> 00:46:59.350
to be a controlled condition.

00:46:59.350 --> 00:47:01.940
So I think we need to
approach it with caution.

00:47:01.940 --> 00:47:03.971
Which isn't to say
that for many people

00:47:03.971 --> 00:47:06.470
it's an extremely meaningful
and important part of their day

00:47:06.470 --> 00:47:09.410
and something that they
really get a lot from.

00:47:09.410 --> 00:47:10.250
And that's great.

00:47:10.250 --> 00:47:12.040
But I think once we
start rolling it out

00:47:12.040 --> 00:47:13.706
as the answer to
everything, then that's

00:47:13.706 --> 00:47:17.309
where it becomes problematic.

00:47:17.309 --> 00:47:18.725
AUDIENCE: Sorry
one more question.

00:47:18.725 --> 00:47:19.010
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Sure.

00:47:19.010 --> 00:47:19.510
Yeah.

00:47:19.510 --> 00:47:21.489
AUDIENCE: So while
you're writing this book

00:47:21.489 --> 00:47:23.030
and doing research
was there anything

00:47:23.030 --> 00:47:25.017
that you found was effective?

00:47:25.017 --> 00:47:25.850
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:47:25.850 --> 00:47:27.530
I mean, I think it comes back--

00:47:27.530 --> 00:47:29.613
this is just keep banging
on about the same thing.

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:33.640
But really it does come down
to connecting with other people

00:47:33.640 --> 00:47:38.300
and doing that in a way
that's most meaningful to you.

00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:41.990
But literally
spending more time--

00:47:41.990 --> 00:47:44.060
seeing that we
spend half an hour

00:47:44.060 --> 00:47:45.800
of our day socializing,
communicating,

00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.675
as opposed to three
hours watching television

00:47:47.675 --> 00:47:49.380
or being on the
internet or whatever,

00:47:49.380 --> 00:47:51.980
and actually just trying
to up those minute.

00:47:51.980 --> 00:47:56.390
To just spend more time doing
it and nurture the relationships

00:47:56.390 --> 00:47:56.990
that we have.

00:47:56.990 --> 00:47:59.930
I think that really is far
and away the best thing you

00:47:59.930 --> 00:48:01.654
can do for your own happiness.

00:48:01.654 --> 00:48:03.320
AUDIENCE: Sorry, to
clarify, I meant out

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.330
of all these kind
of self-help things.

00:48:05.330 --> 00:48:05.830
Yeah.

00:48:05.830 --> 00:48:06.970
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:48:06.970 --> 00:48:11.420
It's an interesting-- I think
a lot of these self-help things

00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.640
that I did, there were one
or two points within them

00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:15.350
that were interesting and
that I took away and thought

00:48:15.350 --> 00:48:16.490
about some more.

00:48:16.490 --> 00:48:18.470
And there were things
in the Landmark forum,

00:48:18.470 --> 00:48:20.390
there were things
from mindfulness

00:48:20.390 --> 00:48:23.420
that I think in certain
situations can be useful.

00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:26.360
But I think, overall, any
one package of solutions,

00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:30.920
I think is usually
over-promising quite heavily.

00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:35.350
And so there was no one
brick or apple, course,

00:48:35.350 --> 00:48:38.520
or whatever, that I could say
OK, well, the answer is this.

00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:42.190
Because it didn't really
feel that way to me.

00:48:46.210 --> 00:48:48.870
SPEAKER: Any more
live questions?

00:48:48.870 --> 00:48:49.530
Cool.

00:48:49.530 --> 00:48:51.960
We'll go to one of the
Dory questions then.

00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.687
When measuring happiness, how
do you correct to the others--

00:48:54.687 --> 00:48:55.520
there's a question--

00:48:55.520 --> 00:48:57.091
[INTERPOSING VOICES]

00:48:57.091 --> 00:48:58.590
When measuring
happiness, how do you

00:48:58.590 --> 00:49:03.801
correct for cultural differences
in what being somewhat very et

00:49:03.801 --> 00:49:05.490
cetera happy?

00:49:05.490 --> 00:49:08.327
I guess how do you add a
measure for cultural differences

00:49:08.327 --> 00:49:09.410
when looking at happiness.

00:49:09.410 --> 00:49:10.080
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Yeah.

00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:11.621
That's a really
interesting question.

00:49:11.621 --> 00:49:13.831
I mean, there's a lot
of research on this,

00:49:13.831 --> 00:49:15.330
because people in
different cultures

00:49:15.330 --> 00:49:18.220
define happiness in
slightly different ways.

00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:23.740
And I think people in
the West, tend to favor--

00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.560
there's a word for
it, which has gone

00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:28.230
from my mind-- but very
high energy emotions

00:49:28.230 --> 00:49:32.880
like exhilaration, excitement,
real extreme emotions.

00:49:32.880 --> 00:49:34.780
And I think maybe in
some other cultures,

00:49:34.780 --> 00:49:37.700
they value a karma
contentment or whatever.

00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:39.600
There was some really
fascinating research

00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:41.790
that came out of UC
Berkeley recently,

00:49:41.790 --> 00:49:44.640
which looked at how
people defined happiness

00:49:44.640 --> 00:49:47.250
in different countries
around the world.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:52.920
And A, how they defined it, and
then B, how happy they were.

00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:59.080
And they found that in parts
of East Asia and in Russia,

00:49:59.080 --> 00:50:00.690
I think, that people
defined happiness

00:50:00.690 --> 00:50:01.980
in a much more collective way.

00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:03.563
So they didn't really
see it as a kind

00:50:03.563 --> 00:50:06.540
of individual pursuit in the
same way that we do in the US.

00:50:06.540 --> 00:50:10.140
But they saw it more as a
socially orientated endeavor.

00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:12.285
And for those people,
the more they--

00:50:12.285 --> 00:50:14.310
if you defined
happiness in that way,

00:50:14.310 --> 00:50:17.340
the more you pursued happiness,
the happier you became.

00:50:17.340 --> 00:50:19.950
Whereas in the US, where
people define happiness

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:22.650
in a more individualistic way,
the more you pursue happiness,

00:50:22.650 --> 00:50:23.760
the less happy you become.

00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:25.930
So it's the opposite way.

00:50:25.930 --> 00:50:27.490
SPEAKER: Super fascinating.

00:50:27.490 --> 00:50:27.990
Cool.

00:50:27.990 --> 00:50:29.380
Well, hey, thank
you for coming here

00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.630
and thank you for
speaking with us.

00:50:30.630 --> 00:50:31.660
RUTH WHIPPMAN: Oh,
thanks for having me.

00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:32.300
It's been such a pleasure.

00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:33.100
SPEAKER: It was
really wonderful.

00:50:33.100 --> 00:50:33.660
RUTH WHIPPMAN: It's been great.

00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:34.260
Thank you.

00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:37.010
[APPLAUSE]
