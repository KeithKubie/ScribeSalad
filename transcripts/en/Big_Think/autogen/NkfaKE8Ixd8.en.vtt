realize Wow birds are dinosaurs and in

this sense they didn't just come from

answer to how scientific revolutions

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:33.730
answer to how scientific revolutions
 

00:02:33.730 --> 00:02:39.140
answer to how scientific revolutions
happen is always do good science and and

00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:39.150
happen is always do good science and and
 

00:02:39.150 --> 00:02:42.620
happen is always do good science and and
and since science is a self-repairing

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:42.630
and since science is a self-repairing
 

00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:45.870
and since science is a self-repairing
process that is it improves itself with

process that is it improves itself with
 

00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:49.230
process that is it improves itself with
the scrutiny and new evidence that

this case the pattern of progress in
modern sizes is incontrovertible however

modern sizes is incontrovertible however
one of the downsides of progress is a

00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:07.090
one of the downsides of progress is a
 

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:10.050
one of the downsides of progress is a
kind of false scientific confidence

00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:10.060
kind of false scientific confidence
 

00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:12.900

don't cause lung cancer then all those
cases of lung cancer are individually

00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:55.180
cases of lung cancer are individually
 

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.809
cases of lung cancer are individually
different and complicated so the null

00:04:57.809 --> 00:04:57.819
different and complicated so the null
 

00:04:57.819 --> 00:04:59.430
different and complicated so the null
hypothesis can actually be more

00:04:59.430 --> 00:04:59.440
hypothesis can actually be more
 

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:02.249
hypothesis can actually be more
complicated explanation then the then

00:05:02.249 --> 00:05:02.259
complicated explanation then the then
 

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:05.309
complicated explanation then the then
the then the main hypothesis right or

00:05:05.309 --> 00:05:05.319
the then the main hypothesis right or
 

00:05:05.319 --> 00:05:09.589
the then the main hypothesis right or
the the the the the signal hypothesis so

00:05:09.589 --> 00:05:09.599
the the the the the signal hypothesis so
 

00:05:09.599 --> 00:05:12.959
the the the the the signal hypothesis so
in science especially in evolutionary

00:05:12.959 --> 00:05:12.969
in science especially in evolutionary
 

00:05:12.969 --> 00:05:16.170
in science especially in evolutionary
science we have found that it's really

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180
science we have found that it's really
 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:21.719
science we have found that it's really
important to overcome our rational

00:05:21.719 --> 00:05:21.729
important to overcome our rational
 

00:05:21.729 --> 00:05:25.110
important to overcome our rational
desire to see meaning and direction in

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:25.120
desire to see meaning and direction in
 

00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:29.369
desire to see meaning and direction in
every data set and ask the question do

00:05:29.369 --> 00:05:29.379
every data set and ask the question do
 

00:05:29.379 --> 00:05:31.140
every data set and ask the question do
we know if anything special is really

00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:31.150
we know if anything special is really
 

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.340
we know if anything special is really
happening

00:05:33.340 --> 00:05:33.350
