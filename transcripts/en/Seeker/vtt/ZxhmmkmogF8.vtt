00:00:00.089 --> 00:00:04.750
Thousands of infants in Brazil are being diagnosed
with a devastating birth defect and medical

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:08.100
researchers believe it might be linked to
a mosquito borne virus.

00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:14.180
So, what is this mysterious virus and how
do we stop it?

00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:24.000
Zika, a strange mosquito borne virus, is sweeping
through many Central and South American countries.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.570
Current estimates place the number of Zika
cases at over a million in Brazil alone.

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:33.160
And in response to the outbreak the CDC has
implemented two new travel bans, to an already

00:00:33.160 --> 00:00:37.490
large list, for pregnant women, one on the
United States Virgin Islands and the other

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:38.850
on the Dominican Republic.

00:00:38.850 --> 00:00:43.500
The ban is for pregnant women specifically
because since the epidemic started, the incidences

00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.340
of microcephaly, a devastating birth defect,
have skyrocketed.

00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.910
Microcephaly is a condition where a baby is
born with a small head.

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:54.520
Because the head is so small in those born
with the condition, the brain is small too,

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.020
meaning it’s underdeveloped.

00:00:56.020 --> 00:01:00.399
Which can cause a whole range of other health
issues like cognitive deficits, seizures,

00:01:00.399 --> 00:01:03.270
feeding problems, vision problems and hearing
loss.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:07.719
Unfortunately there’s no cure for the condition,
only treatments for it’s effects.

00:01:07.719 --> 00:01:12.299
Microcephaly is typically seen in rates of
about 2 in 10,000 births according to a study

00:01:12.299 --> 00:01:14.840
published in the journal Birth Defects Research
(Part A).

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:20.140
But nearly 4,000 cases have been reported
in Brazil since October, that’s nearly 26

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:21.360
times the normal rate.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:25.770
And researchers strongly suspect that the
birth defect is linked to the Zika virus.

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.009
Now this epidemic seemed to come out of nowhere.

00:01:28.009 --> 00:01:31.659
The mosquito that carries the virus, Aedes
aegypti, was pretty much eradicated in Brazil

00:01:31.659 --> 00:01:32.740
in the 1950s.

00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:35.919
But as the decades wore on, it made it’s
way back.

00:01:35.919 --> 00:01:38.579
Then last year reports of Zika in Brazil started
popping up.

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:43.069
But it wasn’t taken too seriously, since
it’s symptoms are mild, just things like

00:01:43.069 --> 00:01:44.520
a fever or a rash.

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:49.389
It wasn’t until the rate of Microcephaly
shot up that the world started to take notice.

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:53.819
Now the battle against Zika is underway, and
one that Brazil is badly losing, according

00:01:53.819 --> 00:01:55.259
to the health minister.

00:01:55.259 --> 00:02:00.180
And it is literally a battle, 220,000 members
of the armed forces are going door to door

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:02.799
to help in the current mosquito eradication
efforts.

00:02:02.799 --> 00:02:07.989
But it’s not just Brazil, Zika has been
reported in 24 regions around the world, mostly

00:02:07.989 --> 00:02:09.599
in tropical areas.

00:02:09.599 --> 00:02:12.569
Each country is issuing warnings, some seem
extreme.

00:02:12.569 --> 00:02:17.760
For instance, the government of El Salvador
told women to avoid pregnancy for two years!

00:02:17.760 --> 00:02:21.709
As for the zika virus itself, there’s no
treatment, vaccine, or cure.

00:02:21.709 --> 00:02:25.590
The CDC says the best way to avoid the virus,
is to avoid mosquito bites.

00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:29.340
Now, experts say that a US outbreak is unlikely
to occur.

00:02:29.340 --> 00:02:33.099
They believe that most cases will happen to
those who travel to Brazil and other affected

00:02:33.099 --> 00:02:34.099
countries.

00:02:34.099 --> 00:02:38.870
But this summer tons of people will descend
on Rio de Janeiro for the 2016 Games.

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:42.739
Which some experts are calling “a perfect
dissemination vehicle for Zika.”

00:02:42.739 --> 00:02:47.180
If people travel to Brazil, get zika from
a mosquito bite, then return home and get

00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:51.500
bitten there, the zika virus could transfer
to the local mosquito population.

00:02:51.500 --> 00:03:26.750
Which would mean that there is the pot
