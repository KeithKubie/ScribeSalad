00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:01.410
Alright Michael, you got the answer?

00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:04.180
&gt;&gt; Yea, I'm ready to try and figure it out.

00:00:04.180 --> 00:00:06.730
&gt;&gt; Alright let's go. Let's try the first one.

00:00:06.730 --> 00:00:08.876
&gt;&gt; I feel like the first one's going to go rather well. So we

00:00:08.876 --> 00:00:15.930
need a pair of strategies so that no player is. Motivated to switch.

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:16.555
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:16.555 --> 00:00:19.360
&gt;&gt; And you told us they were pure strategies, so we actually have a nice

00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:20.890
algorithm for doing this, which is we could

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:22.770
just check one of them with the definition.

00:00:22.770 --> 00:00:23.353
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:23.353 --> 00:00:25.380
&gt;&gt; But, but in the case of prisoner's dilemma, I think

00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.810
a natural place to start would be that minus 6, minus 6.

00:00:27.810 --> 00:00:28.290
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:28.290 --> 00:00:31.390
&gt;&gt; So let's say that A chooses the second row and B

00:00:31.390 --> 00:00:36.230
chooses the second column, let's see if that's a Nash Equilibrium. So

00:00:36.230 --> 00:00:38.400
both players need to be happy. So if, would A be happier

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:42.280
switching? If A switched, it would be getting minus 9, which is worse.

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:42.360
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.950
&gt;&gt; So A is happy, where A is. And if B

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:49.010
switches, B would be getting minus 9, so boom, Nash Equilibrium.

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:49.360
&gt;&gt; Done.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:50.500
&gt;&gt; Now I didn't verify that other

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:52.340
ones weren't a Nash Equilibrium, but you didn't

00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.620
say. Find all of the Nash Equilibrium. You just

00:00:55.620 --> 00:00:57.720
said find, well you did say find the.

00:00:57.720 --> 00:00:59.630
So you kind of implied that there's just one.

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.840
&gt;&gt; Right. But actually that's true, but you don't have to check this because

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:05.855
we already went through an exercise where we, where we knew the answer was minus

00:01:05.855 --> 00:01:10.770
6, minus 6. And the way we did that was we noticed that for A defecting the

00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:15.880
second row is always better than this. Right? And then in particular this

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:18.280
row strictly dominates this row.

00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:19.520
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:01:19.520 --> 00:01:23.420
&gt;&gt; Which implies that if I picked anything on this

00:01:23.420 --> 00:01:25.610
row I would rather move to the other row. And

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:26.877
you can see it. Minus 1 0 is better. Minus

00:01:26.877 --> 00:01:29.190
9, minus 6 is better. That's what it means to

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:32.940
be strictly dominated. So, I'd never pick this row anyway.

00:01:32.940 --> 00:01:35.900
And this same argument for B for this column. So,

00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:37.840
you'll notice that by getting rid of the things that

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:41.110
are strictly dominated, the only thing we're left with is this.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:46.940
And, it turns out, in fact, to be a Nash Equilibrium. So, this is correct.

00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:52.370
&gt;&gt; So, you just told me how to do my job, which makes me little sad.

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:53.710
&gt;&gt; Well, in this instance.

00:01:53.710 --> 00:01:56.210
&gt;&gt; Because I already had the answer to this. But maybe, maybe

00:01:56.210 --> 00:02:00.330
you were signalling to me how I might attack this next problem. Maybe.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:02.370
&gt;&gt; Maybe.

00:02:02.370 --> 00:02:07.160
&gt;&gt; So, A is choosing a row and gets the first number.

00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:11.360
So, is there a row, that, were they dominates all the other rows?

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.970
It doesn't seem that way.

00:02:14.970 --> 00:02:15.990
&gt;&gt; Mh-hm

00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:18.920
&gt;&gt; But maybe, maybe, oh I could start with B, maybe B, there's a

00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:21.720
column that dominates all the other columns.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.130
But no, it looks like it's totally symmetrical.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:26.770
&gt;&gt; Yep, so strictly dominated doesn't necessarily

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:28.950
help here, and by necessarily I mean doesn't.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.560
&gt;&gt; So that was kind of mean. Thank you.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:35.120
&gt;&gt; All right, so oh, but we have something else we could do.

00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:35.550
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:38.762
&gt;&gt; So, there is a, the largest number that anybody can

00:02:38.762 --> 00:02:39.462
get is 6.

00:02:39.462 --> 00:02:40.635
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.

00:02:40.635 --> 00:02:43.103
&gt;&gt; And there's a play where both of them can get the 6.

00:02:43.103 --> 00:02:43.434
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:02:43.434 --> 00:02:44.618
&gt;&gt; So there's no way they're going to want

00:02:44.618 --> 00:02:46.542
to switch away from that, because everyone's getting there

00:02:46.542 --> 00:02:47.947
kind of maximum out of reward. So A

00:02:47.947 --> 00:02:53.940
bottom row, B right column, gets us Nash Equilibrium.

00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:55.986
&gt;&gt; And that is in fact correct, and you can

00:02:55.986 --> 00:02:58.528
see it because from here I would always, it would

00:02:58.528 --> 00:03:01.070
always be worse for me, and it would always worse

00:03:01.070 --> 00:03:03.834
for me. So, these are in fact the Nash Equilibrium,

00:03:03.834 --> 00:03:05.137
for these two problems.

00:03:05.137 --> 00:03:08.516
&gt;&gt; Cool. They've seemed easier than I was expecting.

00:03:08.516 --> 00:03:08.530
&gt;&gt; Mm-hm.
