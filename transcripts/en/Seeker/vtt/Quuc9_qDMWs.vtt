00:00:00.179 --> 00:00:03.920
Remember when you were a kid and everything
was simple and you were told there were just

00:00:03.920 --> 00:00:07.459
three states of matter: solid, liquid, and
gas?

00:00:07.459 --> 00:00:11.830
And then you got older and learned that plasma
existed and you thought, “Ok, now I know

00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:14.290
everything, it can’t possibly get more complicated”?

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:17.320
Well, it just got more complicated.

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.140
Scientists have found a new state of matter
that is a solid and a liquid at the same time,

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.160
and they used artificial intelligence that
could lead to future discoveries about what’s

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.000
happening inside planets and stars.

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.750
Scientists at the University of Edinburgh
discovered that under extreme pressure, the

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.910
metal potassium starts behaving very strangely.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:39.559
In normal conditions, a bar of pure potassium
is pretty unremarkable.

00:00:39.559 --> 00:00:43.890
I mean, aside from its tendency to explode
if you get it wet.

00:00:43.890 --> 00:00:48.920
But dry potassium atoms link up and form orderly
rows that conduct heat and electricity well.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:53.430
For a long time, scientists thought that was
all there was to potassium’s structure,

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:57.790
until over a decade ago when scientists put
sodium under extreme pressure.

00:00:57.790 --> 00:01:03.129
At 20,000 times earth’s atmospheric pressure,
sodium transforms from shiny to transparent,

00:01:03.129 --> 00:01:06.280
and from a conductor to an insulator.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.100
X-ray images showed the crystal structure
had gone from simple to complex.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:15.750
Sodium is an alkali metal just above potassium
on the periodic table, so scientists reasoned

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:19.600
if it behaves oddly under pressure, maybe
potassium does too.

00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:24.680
And indeed, at extreme pressures, potassium
atoms rearrange themselves from orderly rows

00:01:24.680 --> 00:01:26.950
into a much more complicated structure.

00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:29.840
They form five tubes, arranged in an X shape.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.630
Edge on it would look like a five on a playing
die.

00:01:32.630 --> 00:01:36.220
In between the outer tubes are chains of potassium
atoms.

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:40.799
Researchers describe it as two loosely linked
sublattices, with the tubes acting as “host”

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.530
atoms while the chains were “guest” atoms.

00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:47.310
When researchers turned up the heat on their
high-pressure potassium, that’s when things

00:01:47.310 --> 00:01:48.600
got weird.

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:51.450
X-ray images showed the chains disappeared.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.369
To figure out where they went, they turned
to computer simulation.

00:01:54.369 --> 00:01:58.640
They trained a neural network using small
groups of potassium atoms until the artificial

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.000
intelligence understood quantum mechanics
well enough to simulate it on a larger scale,

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.570
up to 20,000 atoms.

00:02:04.570 --> 00:02:09.319
Can we just take a moment to appreciate that
computer science is at the point that software

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:12.359
can teach itself quantum mechanics?

00:02:12.359 --> 00:02:17.200
When the computer model simulated potassium
atoms at 20,000 to 40,000 times atmospheric

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:21.980
pressure, and between 400 and 800 Kelvin,
it showed that the chains between the tubes

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.419
melted into liquid, while the tubes remained
solid.

00:02:25.419 --> 00:02:28.260
The potassium was in both states at once.

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.870
The researchers described it as though you
had a sponge that leaked water… except the

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:35.599
sponge is also made of water.

00:02:35.599 --> 00:02:38.799
They dubbed this new phase of matter the “chain-melted
state.”

00:02:38.799 --> 00:02:43.349
While that is objectively fascinating, you
may be wondering, “So what?

00:02:43.349 --> 00:02:46.689
When is potassium going to be under those
conditions?”

00:02:46.689 --> 00:02:50.069
Potassium could exist in this state in the
earth’s mantle, though it’s rarely in

00:02:50.069 --> 00:02:54.370
its pure form, what with its preponderance
to react violently and explode.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:58.499
The machine learning technique that developed
the computer model, however, can be used for

00:02:58.499 --> 00:03:02.099
other elements in extreme situations beyond
potassium.

00:03:02.099 --> 00:03:06.799
Conditions are pretty tame on Earth’s surface,
but in the universe, extreme temperatures

00:03:06.799 --> 00:03:08.809
and pressures are the norm.

00:03:08.809 --> 00:03:12.000
Inside planets and stars matter could be doing
all sorts of odd things.

00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.419
Thanks to artificial intelligence we might
be able to peel back the skin of alien worlds

00:03:17.419 --> 00:03:19.909
to take a peek at what’s going on under
the surface.

00:03:19.909 --> 00:03:24.730
Fun Fact: This computer model worked really
well, not only simulating the chain-melted

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:29.000
state, but all of potassium’s fourteen known
phase transitions.

00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:31.529
That’s more phases than I went through in
high school.

00:03:31.529 --> 00:03:35.299
