00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.099
&gt;&gt; Good morning or good evening or whatever.
My name is Paolo DallOglio and I am a monk

00:00:09.099 --> 00:00:15.209
in the desert of Syria and I speak very, very
bad English although I wish to speak Arabic.

00:00:15.209 --> 00:00:25.750
The next video will be in Arabic. Yes the
role models are important for our region and

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:35.570
for our society and those models, let me say
models should be from the ethical point of

00:00:35.570 --> 00:00:46.010
view, from the moral point of view, something
really not only outstanding, at the level,

00:00:46.010 --> 00:00:55.480
should be convincing, coherent and this will
be luck. We like as a society, we look to

00:00:55.480 --> 00:01:07.540
appreciate transparency. We are built into
looking and seeking the relationship with

00:01:07.540 --> 00:01:17.399
power. The power of the Father, the power
of the professor, the power of the employer.

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:30.869
We all over the world, but here power comes
before upper and after the law and justice

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:43.100
and so role model means for me deeply to look
for transparency and for people that are able

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:54.090
to pay, I would not say pay with the blood,
pay with the passions, paying with a consistency,

00:01:54.090 --> 00:02:03.899
paying with a gracefulness of the kind of
values that they want to embody in the life

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:19.040
and the society. We have models in our religious
models, ideals, people have been able to put

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:27.400
spiritual values before [inaudible] and after
interests and this is what is saving our society

00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:35.220
until today. Family values, religious values
so that we have something to build on but

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:46.300
we have not only to stay attached to it, it's
not enough. We have to start new life on that

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:57.150
base with a lot of capacity on invention [inaudible]
and capacity of change. Transparency and coherence.
