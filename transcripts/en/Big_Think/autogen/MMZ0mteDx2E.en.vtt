00:00:08.330 --> 00:00:12.910
so synthetic biology is in a way a very

00:00:12.910 --> 00:00:12.920
so synthetic biology is in a way a very
 

00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.380
so synthetic biology is in a way a very
new kind of science and not so new in

00:00:17.380 --> 00:00:17.390
new kind of science and not so new in
 

00:00:17.390 --> 00:00:22.660
new kind of science and not so new in
another way in the late 1960s scientists

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.670
another way in the late 1960s scientists
 

00:00:22.670 --> 00:00:25.599
another way in the late 1960s scientists
were figuring out so the basic molecular

00:00:25.599 --> 00:00:25.609
were figuring out so the basic molecular
 

00:00:25.609 --> 00:00:29.200
were figuring out so the basic molecular
workings of life and they were

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:29.210
workings of life and they were
 

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:30.730
workings of life and they were
understanding it's so well particularly

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:30.740
understanding it's so well particularly
 

00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:35.250
understanding it's so well particularly
in little organisms like e.coli bacteria

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:35.260
in little organisms like e.coli bacteria
 

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.570
in little organisms like e.coli bacteria
that they said you know we might be able

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:37.580
that they said you know we might be able
 

00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:42.430
that they said you know we might be able
to actually engineer living things and

00:00:42.430 --> 00:00:42.440
to actually engineer living things and
 

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.219
to actually engineer living things and
so the first really spectacular example

00:00:45.219 --> 00:00:45.229
so the first really spectacular example
 

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.950
so the first really spectacular example
of that was with e.coli what scientists

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:47.960
of that was with e.coli what scientists
 

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:53.140
of that was with e.coli what scientists
did was take a gene for insulin for

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:53.150
did was take a gene for insulin for
 

00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:54.609
did was take a gene for insulin for
human insulin the kind of insulin we

00:00:54.609 --> 00:00:54.619
human insulin the kind of insulin we
 

00:00:54.619 --> 00:00:56.979
human insulin the kind of insulin we
make in our own bodies and inserting

00:00:56.979 --> 00:00:56.989
make in our own bodies and inserting
 

00:00:56.989 --> 00:00:59.229
make in our own bodies and inserting
that into the coli and so now you have

00:00:59.229 --> 00:00:59.239
that into the coli and so now you have
 

00:00:59.239 --> 00:01:03.280
that into the coli and so now you have
ecoli with this gene actually churning

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:03.290
ecoli with this gene actually churning
 

00:01:03.290 --> 00:01:06.000
ecoli with this gene actually churning
out human insulin and so a lot of

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:06.010
out human insulin and so a lot of
 

00:01:06.010 --> 00:01:08.950
out human insulin and so a lot of
diabetics today actually get their

00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:08.960
diabetics today actually get their
 

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.280
diabetics today actually get their
insulin from ecoli it doesn't say e coli

00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:12.290
insulin from ecoli it doesn't say e coli
 

00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:14.920
insulin from ecoli it doesn't say e coli
on box but that's where it comes from so

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:14.930
on box but that's where it comes from so
 

00:01:14.930 --> 00:01:16.870
on box but that's where it comes from so
that went by the name of genetic

00:01:16.870 --> 00:01:16.880
that went by the name of genetic
 

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.330
that went by the name of genetic
engineering and basically gave rise to

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:19.340
engineering and basically gave rise to
 

00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:21.280
engineering and basically gave rise to
the whole biotechnology industry which

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:21.290
the whole biotechnology industry which
 

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:22.810
the whole biotechnology industry which
is about an 80 billion dollar industry

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:22.820
is about an 80 billion dollar industry
 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:27.400
is about an 80 billion dollar industry
today so more recently scientists have

00:01:27.400 --> 00:01:27.410
today so more recently scientists have
 

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.830
today so more recently scientists have
said maybe we can take this further

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:31.840
said maybe we can take this further
 

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:35.170
said maybe we can take this further
rather than just sticking one or two or

00:01:35.170 --> 00:01:35.180
rather than just sticking one or two or
 

00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:38.800
rather than just sticking one or two or
three genes into a host microbe for

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:38.810
three genes into a host microbe for
 

00:01:38.810 --> 00:01:43.780
three genes into a host microbe for
example you know maybe we can tailor our

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:43.790
example you know maybe we can tailor our
 

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.440
example you know maybe we can tailor our
entire networks of genes so that can do

00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:47.450
entire networks of genes so that can do
 

00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:51.310
entire networks of genes so that can do
really sophisticated new things and so

00:01:51.310 --> 00:01:51.320
really sophisticated new things and so
 

00:01:51.320 --> 00:01:52.360
really sophisticated new things and so
what they're trying to do is they're

00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:52.370
what they're trying to do is they're
 

00:01:52.370 --> 00:01:55.270
what they're trying to do is they're
trying to think about ecoli or any other

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:55.280
trying to think about ecoli or any other
 

00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:59.110
trying to think about ecoli or any other
microbe or cell as a kind of a network

00:01:59.110 --> 00:01:59.120
microbe or cell as a kind of a network
 

00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.630
microbe or cell as a kind of a network
in the same way that you could think of

00:02:01.630 --> 00:02:01.640
in the same way that you could think of
 

00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:03.610
in the same way that you could think of
the circuits and a cell phone in the

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:03.620
the circuits and a cell phone in the
 

00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:06.219
the circuits and a cell phone in the
network and so they just take a the

00:02:06.219 --> 00:02:06.229
network and so they just take a the
 

00:02:06.229 --> 00:02:07.750
network and so they just take a the
point of view of an engineer and I just

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:07.760
point of view of an engineer and I just
 

00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:09.309
point of view of an engineer and I just
say I'm going to rearrange this network

00:02:09.309 --> 00:02:09.319
say I'm going to rearrange this network
 

00:02:09.319 --> 00:02:11.020
say I'm going to rearrange this network
i'm going to plug in new units and make

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:11.030
i'm going to plug in new units and make
 

00:02:11.030 --> 00:02:12.729
i'm going to plug in new units and make
this network look differently and do new

00:02:12.729 --> 00:02:12.739
this network look differently and do new
 

00:02:12.739 --> 00:02:15.610
this network look differently and do new
things things that you might never

00:02:15.610 --> 00:02:15.620
things things that you might never
 

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:20.710
things things that you might never
imagine living things doing before right

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
imagine living things doing before right
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:22.120
imagine living things doing before right
now

00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:22.130
now
 

00:02:22.130 --> 00:02:25.440
now
static biology is still in kind of the

00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:25.450
static biology is still in kind of the
 

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:28.540
static biology is still in kind of the
science fair stage I would call it and

00:02:28.540 --> 00:02:28.550
science fair stage I would call it and
 

00:02:28.550 --> 00:02:30.940
science fair stage I would call it and
actually if you go to MIT every year

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:30.950
actually if you go to MIT every year
 

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.330
actually if you go to MIT every year
they have a contest for students so

00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:34.340
they have a contest for students so
 

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:35.950
they have a contest for students so
these undergraduates get together and

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:35.960
these undergraduates get together and
 

00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:39.340
these undergraduates get together and
they say hey wouldn't it be cool if for

00:02:39.340 --> 00:02:39.350
they say hey wouldn't it be cool if for
 

00:02:39.350 --> 00:02:42.910
they say hey wouldn't it be cool if for
example we could make ecoli flash in

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:42.920
example we could make ecoli flash in
 

00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.520
example we could make ecoli flash in
these pretty colors let's make eco light

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:45.530
these pretty colors let's make eco light
 

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.500
these pretty colors let's make eco light
it gives off rainbows of colors or let's

00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:47.510
it gives off rainbows of colors or let's
 

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.990
it gives off rainbows of colors or let's
make ecoli that that gives off the the

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:50.000
make ecoli that that gives off the the
 

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.150
make ecoli that that gives off the the
odor of spearmint because normally you

00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:52.160
odor of spearmint because normally you
 

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.610
odor of spearmint because normally you
call I smells pretty nasty so let's make

00:02:54.610 --> 00:02:54.620
call I smells pretty nasty so let's make
 

00:02:54.620 --> 00:02:59.290
call I smells pretty nasty so let's make
the nice smelling e.coli and it takes

00:02:59.290 --> 00:02:59.300
the nice smelling e.coli and it takes
 

00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.360
the nice smelling e.coli and it takes
undergraduates a few weeks in the summer

00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:01.370
undergraduates a few weeks in the summer
 

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:05.710
undergraduates a few weeks in the summer
to do just that which is amazing and a

00:03:05.710 --> 00:03:05.720
to do just that which is amazing and a
 

00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:11.380
to do just that which is amazing and a
little scary that even a 18 year old has

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:11.390
little scary that even a 18 year old has
 

00:03:11.390 --> 00:03:14.410
little scary that even a 18 year old has
the power to transform life in ways it

00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:14.420
the power to transform life in ways it
 

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:17.500
the power to transform life in ways it
has never been transformed before the

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:17.510
has never been transformed before the
 

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:19.450
has never been transformed before the
reason that they can do this all is

00:03:19.450 --> 00:03:19.460
reason that they can do this all is
 

00:03:19.460 --> 00:03:22.330
reason that they can do this all is
because there are now these these online

00:03:22.330 --> 00:03:22.340
because there are now these these online
 

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:26.080
because there are now these these online
databases of genes and they're basically

00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:26.090
databases of genes and they're basically
 

00:03:26.090 --> 00:03:28.690
databases of genes and they're basically
laid out kind of like you would look in

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:28.700
laid out kind of like you would look in
 

00:03:28.700 --> 00:03:31.840
laid out kind of like you would look in
a catalog of circuit parts for example

00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:31.850
a catalog of circuit parts for example
 

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:33.970
a catalog of circuit parts for example
and you can say oh I want that I want

00:03:33.970 --> 00:03:33.980
and you can say oh I want that I want
 

00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.710
and you can say oh I want that I want
that I want that and I'm going to plug

00:03:35.710 --> 00:03:35.720
that I want that and I'm going to plug
 

00:03:35.720 --> 00:03:38.590
that I want that and I'm going to plug
them together to make them do whatever

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:38.600
them together to make them do whatever
 

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.670
them together to make them do whatever
it is I want them to do now we're going

00:03:42.670 --> 00:03:42.680
it is I want them to do now we're going
 

00:03:42.680 --> 00:03:44.980
it is I want them to do now we're going
to go very rapidly from the science fair

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:44.990
to go very rapidly from the science fair
 

00:03:44.990 --> 00:03:47.530
to go very rapidly from the science fair
stage to the industrial stage I mean

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:47.540
stage to the industrial stage I mean
 

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:48.910
stage to the industrial stage I mean
there's a huge amount of investment in

00:03:48.910 --> 00:03:48.920
there's a huge amount of investment in
 

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.940
there's a huge amount of investment in
synthetic biology now one of the really

00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:51.950
synthetic biology now one of the really
 

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.000
synthetic biology now one of the really
spectacular possible advances is using

00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:58.010
spectacular possible advances is using
 

00:03:58.010 --> 00:04:02.590
spectacular possible advances is using
ecoli or maybe yeast to make medicine

00:04:02.590 --> 00:04:02.600
ecoli or maybe yeast to make medicine
 

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.230
ecoli or maybe yeast to make medicine
for malaria there's a very effective

00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:05.240
for malaria there's a very effective
 

00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.300
for malaria there's a very effective
medicine from malaria that comes from a

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:07.310
medicine from malaria that comes from a
 

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:09.880
medicine from malaria that comes from a
plant called a wormwood plant which

00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:09.890
plant called a wormwood plant which
 

00:04:09.890 --> 00:04:14.440
plant called a wormwood plant which
normally grows in in Asia the problem

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:14.450
normally grows in in Asia the problem
 

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:18.820
normally grows in in Asia the problem
there is that it's hard to raise the

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:18.830
there is that it's hard to raise the
 

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:21.849
there is that it's hard to raise the
plant and then isolate this this drug

00:04:21.849 --> 00:04:21.859
plant and then isolate this this drug
 

00:04:21.859 --> 00:04:24.430
plant and then isolate this this drug
from it called Artemis Minh it's

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:24.440
from it called Artemis Minh it's
 

00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.250
from it called Artemis Minh it's
expensive and it's slow and it keeps the

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:27.260
expensive and it's slow and it keeps the
 

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:31.170
expensive and it's slow and it keeps the
price pretty high so the hope is that

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:31.180
price pretty high so the hope is that
 

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:32.830
price pretty high so the hope is that
scientists at the University of

00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:32.840
scientists at the University of
 

00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:35.350
scientists at the University of
California Berkeley are going to be able

00:04:35.350 --> 00:04:35.360
California Berkeley are going to be able
 

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.910
California Berkeley are going to be able
to put

00:04:35.910 --> 00:04:35.920
to put
 

00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:39.930
to put
program yeast by just plugging in genes

00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:39.940
program yeast by just plugging in genes
 

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.880
program yeast by just plugging in genes
from different kinds of plants to turn
