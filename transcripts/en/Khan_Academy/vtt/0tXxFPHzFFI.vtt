00:00:00.937 --> 00:00:02.954
- [Voiceover] So let's
get a basic understanding

00:00:02.954 --> 00:00:07.263
of the comparison test when
we are trying to decide

00:00:07.263 --> 00:00:10.823
whether a series is
converging or diverging.

00:00:10.823 --> 00:00:12.661
So let's think of two series.

00:00:12.661 --> 00:00:16.630
So let's say that I have
this magenta series here.

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:17.690
It's an infinite series from n equals one

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:19.474
to infinity of a sub n.

00:00:19.474 --> 00:00:21.773
We're speaking in generalities here,

00:00:21.773 --> 00:00:23.743
and let's have another one.

00:00:23.743 --> 00:00:27.818
That's the series b sub n
from n equals one to infinity,

00:00:27.818 --> 00:00:30.872
and we know some things
about these series.

00:00:30.872 --> 00:00:33.768
The first thing we know
is that all the terms

00:00:33.768 --> 00:00:36.350
in these series are non-negative.

00:00:36.350 --> 00:00:41.350
So a sub n and b sub n
are greater than or equal

00:00:41.857 --> 00:00:45.948
to zero, which tells us
that these are either

00:00:45.948 --> 00:00:49.527
going to diverge to positive infinity

00:00:49.527 --> 00:00:54.527
or they're going to converge
to some finite value.

00:00:55.894 --> 00:00:57.286
They're not going to
oscillate, because you're not

00:00:57.286 --> 00:00:58.551
going to have negative values here.

00:00:58.551 --> 00:00:59.964
You can't go to negative
infinity, because you

00:00:59.964 --> 00:01:02.318
don't have negative values here.

00:01:02.318 --> 00:01:05.640
Now, let's say we also know that each

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.130
of the corresponding
terms in the first series

00:01:08.130 --> 00:01:11.221
are less than or equal
to the corresponding term

00:01:11.221 --> 00:01:13.590
in the second series.

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.401
Less than or equal to b sub n.

00:01:16.401 --> 00:01:18.528
Once again, this is true for all the ns

00:01:18.528 --> 00:01:19.689
that we care about.

00:01:19.689 --> 00:01:22.329
So n equals one, two, three,

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:25.350
all the way on, and on, and on.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:29.328
So the comparison test
tells us that because

00:01:29.328 --> 00:01:31.875
all the corresponding terms

00:01:31.875 --> 00:01:34.094
of this series are less
than the corresponding

00:01:34.094 --> 00:01:36.971
terms here, but they're greater than zero,

00:01:36.971 --> 00:01:40.568
that if this series converges,
the one that's larger,

00:01:40.568 --> 00:01:41.849
if this one converges, well then the one

00:01:41.849 --> 00:01:44.970
that is smaller than
it, or I guess when we

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.566
think about it is kind
of bounded by this one,

00:01:46.566 --> 00:01:47.915
must also converge.

00:01:47.915 --> 00:01:49.255
I'm not doing a formal
proof here, but hopefully

00:01:49.255 --> 00:01:51.409
that gives you a little bit of intuition.

00:01:51.409 --> 00:01:56.409
So the comparison test tells
us if, I guess in my brain

00:01:58.107 --> 00:02:01.732
the larger series, the one
whose corresponding terms

00:02:01.732 --> 00:02:04.370
are at least as large as
the ones here, if this one

00:02:04.370 --> 00:02:06.830
converges, if this one
doesn't go unbounded

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:11.413
towards infinity, it sums
to some finite value,

00:02:11.413 --> 00:02:15.626
then that tells us that the
one that is in some ways

00:02:15.626 --> 00:02:19.610
I guess you could say
smaller must also converge.

00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:25.215
So this one right over
here must also converge.

00:02:26.384 --> 00:02:28.114
So that must also converge.

00:02:28.114 --> 00:02:29.580
So why is that useful?

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:31.152
We'll see this in future videos.

00:02:31.152 --> 00:02:33.628
Well if you find if you're
looking you have your

00:02:33.628 --> 00:02:35.684
a sub n and you're like
gee, I wish I could prove

00:02:35.684 --> 00:02:37.615
that it converges, I kind
of have a gut feeling

00:02:37.615 --> 00:02:40.372
it converges, the comparison
test tells us, well,

00:02:40.372 --> 00:02:45.372
just find another series
that whose corresponding

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.182
terms are at least as
large as the corresponding

00:02:47.182 --> 00:02:50.309
terms here, and if you can
prove that one converges,

00:02:50.309 --> 00:02:52.320
then you're good with this one.

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:53.773
Of course it would only apply to the case

00:02:53.773 --> 00:02:57.755
where your original
series, each of the terms

00:02:57.755 --> 00:02:59.916
are non-negative.

00:02:59.916 --> 00:03:01.847
Now what if you went the other way around?

00:03:01.847 --> 00:03:04.617
What if you could prove
that the magenta series,

00:03:04.617 --> 00:03:06.726
the smaller one, and I
guess I could kind of

00:03:06.726 --> 00:03:08.857
put them in quotes,
this one right over here

00:03:08.857 --> 00:03:13.857
is the smaller, I guess
each of its corresponding

00:03:14.330 --> 00:03:15.868
terms are smaller, what if you could prove

00:03:15.868 --> 00:03:18.336
this one diverges?

00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:20.103
Well if this one
diverges, it's going to go

00:03:20.103 --> 00:03:21.684
unbounded to infinity.

00:03:21.684 --> 00:03:23.370
It's not going to go to negative infinity.

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:24.160
All the terms are positive.

00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:26.032
It's not going to diverge because

00:03:26.032 --> 00:03:27.451
it oscillates between two values.

00:03:27.451 --> 00:03:29.526
Once again, if it's
oscillating between values

00:03:29.526 --> 00:03:31.394
the only way you could do that is if you

00:03:31.394 --> 00:03:33.640
had negative terms here,
so this would kind of

00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:36.597
be unbounded towards infinity.

00:03:36.597 --> 00:03:38.632
Well if this one is
unbounded, each of these

00:03:38.632 --> 00:03:40.424
corresponding terms
are larger, so this one

00:03:40.424 --> 00:03:41.758
must also be unbounded.

00:03:41.758 --> 00:03:43.743
So let's write that down.

00:03:43.743 --> 00:03:48.743
So the comparison test
tells us if our smaller

00:03:50.481 --> 00:03:54.977
series diverges, if this one diverges,

00:03:54.977 --> 00:03:58.495
then the larger one must also diverge.

00:04:04.714 --> 00:04:06.669
So once again, if you wanted to prove that

00:04:06.669 --> 00:04:09.188
this thing right over
here is going to diverge,

00:04:09.188 --> 00:04:11.262
and if you have a, once
again you know that

00:04:11.262 --> 00:04:12.930
all the b sub ns are greater
than or equal to zero

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:14.772
and you want to prove it diverges,

00:04:14.772 --> 00:04:18.241
well, maybe you could try
to find another series

00:04:18.241 --> 00:04:19.893
where each of the
corresponding terms are less

00:04:19.893 --> 00:04:21.912
than the corresponding
terms here and you could

00:04:21.912 --> 00:04:25.531
prove this one diverges,
then you would be all set.

00:04:25.531 --> 00:04:29.209
We're going to start doing
that in the next few videos.
