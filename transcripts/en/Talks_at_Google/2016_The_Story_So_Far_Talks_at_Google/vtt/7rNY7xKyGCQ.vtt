[APPLAUSE]

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.410
MICHAEL GREGER: Thank you.

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.990
For those of you
unfamiliar with my work,

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.080
every year I read through every
issue of every English language

00:00:11.080 --> 00:00:13.830
nutrition journal in
the world so busy folks

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.774
like you don't have to.

00:00:16.774 --> 00:00:18.190
So every year my
presentations are

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:19.970
new because every year
the science is new.

00:00:19.970 --> 00:00:21.553
I think probably the
most interesting,

00:00:21.553 --> 00:00:23.460
most groundbreaking,
most practical findings

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.980
to new videos and
articles I upload

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:28.200
every day to my nonprofit
site, NutritionFacts.org.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:30.300
Everything on the
website is free.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:32.549
There are no ads, no
commercial sponsorships,

00:00:32.549 --> 00:00:34.640
strictly noncommercial,
not selling anything.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:38.580
Just put it up as a public
service, as a labor of love,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:40.450
new videos and
articles every day

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:44.437
on the latest in
evidence-based nutrition.

00:00:44.437 --> 00:00:46.770
Now, if you've seen any of
my presentations in the past,

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.228
you know that I
have addressed some

00:00:48.228 --> 00:00:54.580
of the most pressing dietary
issues of our time, like what's

00:00:54.580 --> 00:00:57.916
the healthiest variety
of apple, for example;

00:00:57.916 --> 00:01:01.815
or the most nutritious
nut; or the best bean;

00:01:01.815 --> 00:01:06.720
or the best berry; or
the best bowel movement?

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.420
Who's number one and number two?

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:11.510
Well, it was certainly
wasn't the New Yorkers here.

00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:13.760
Actually, the most
constipated population

00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:15.570
ever described in the
medical literature,

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.710
outputting a measly three
ounces a day on average,

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:24.537
maybe if you'd all just eat
a big apple once in a while.

00:01:24.537 --> 00:01:25.790
Ahem.

00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:28.230
But this year,
today, I thought I'd

00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:33.740
lighted it up and ask what's
the best way to prevent death?

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:36.609
Every year, the CDC compiles
the top 15 cause of death.

00:01:36.609 --> 00:01:38.650
And I said, well, let's
just go through the list.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:40.790
1 through 15, and talk
about the role diet

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:44.630
may play in preventing,
arresting, and even potentially

00:01:44.630 --> 00:01:48.060
reversing our top 15 killers.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:52.069
Killer number one
is heart disease.

00:01:52.069 --> 00:01:53.860
The "International
Journal of Epidemiology"

00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:55.850
recently reprinted
this landmark article

00:01:55.850 --> 00:01:59.710
from the '50s, which started
out with a shocking statement.

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:01.720
In an African
population in Uganda,

00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:03.935
coronary heart disease
practically nonexistent.

00:02:03.935 --> 00:02:05.380
You say, wait a second.

00:02:05.380 --> 00:02:08.560
Our number one killer
practically nonexistent?

00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:10.770
What were they eating?

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.200
Well, they're eating a lot of
vegetables, grains, greens,

00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:19.030
and their protein almost
entirely from plant sources.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.430
And they had the
cholesterol levels

00:02:21.430 --> 00:02:24.300
to prove it, actually very
similar to what you see in kind

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:26.455
of modern-day plant eaters.

00:02:26.455 --> 00:02:28.034
You say, wait a second.

00:02:28.034 --> 00:02:29.450
Maybe the Africans
were just dying

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.200
earlier from other diseases,
didn't live long enough

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.430
to get coronary artery disease.

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:35.930
No.

00:02:35.930 --> 00:02:40.530
Here's age match, heart attack
rates in Uganda vs. St. Louis.

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:46.770
Out of 632 autopsies in Uganda,
only one myocardial infarction.

00:02:46.770 --> 00:02:52.664
Out of 632 age and
gender-matched autopsies

00:02:52.664 --> 00:02:57.710
in St. Louis, 136
myocardial infarctions.

00:02:57.710 --> 00:03:00.060
More than a hundred
times the heart

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.849
attacks of the rate
of our leading killer.

00:03:03.849 --> 00:03:05.390
In fact, they were
so blown away they

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:07.545
went back and did another
800 autopsies in Uganda.

00:03:07.545 --> 00:03:09.995
And still, just one
small healed infarct.

00:03:09.995 --> 00:03:11.810
I mean it wasn't even
the cause of death.

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:17.150
Out of 1,427 patients, less
than one in a thousand.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.100
Whereas here, it's an epidemic.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:23.210
Here's a list of
diseases commonly found

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.295
here and in populations that
eat and live like the US,

00:03:29.295 --> 00:03:32.460
but were rare or
even nonexistent

00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:34.670
in populations
centering their diets

00:03:34.670 --> 00:03:37.740
around whole,
unprocessed plant foods.

00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:41.550
These are among our
most common diseases,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:46.190
like obesity, for example, or
hiatus hernia, the most common

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:48.424
stomach problem.

00:03:48.424 --> 00:03:49.840
Varicose veins and
hemorrhoids are

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.905
the two most common venous
problems; colorectal cancer,

00:03:52.905 --> 00:03:56.860
a leading cancer
killer here in the US;

00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.800
diverticulitis, the most common
disease of the intestines;

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:04.090
appendicitis, the number
one cause of emergency

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:06.340
abdominal surgery, gallbladder
disease, the number one

00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:08.180
cause of non-emergency
abdominal surgery;

00:04:08.180 --> 00:04:11.190
as well as ischemic heart
disease, our commonest cause

00:04:11.190 --> 00:04:16.820
of death here, but a rarity
among plant-based populations.

00:04:16.820 --> 00:04:20.899
Which suggests
that heart disease

00:04:20.899 --> 00:04:25.404
may be a choice, like cavities.

00:04:25.404 --> 00:04:26.820
If you look at the
teeth of people

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.070
who lived 10,000 years
before the invention

00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:33.330
of the toothbrush,
pretty much no cavities.

00:04:33.330 --> 00:04:36.640
Didn't brush a day
in their lives,

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:41.600
no flossing, no Listerine,
yet no cavities.

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.290
Why?

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.170
Candy bars hadn't
been invented yet.

00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:49.210
So why do people
continue to get cavities

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:53.100
when we know they're
preventable through diet?

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.320
Well, simple.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:56.470
Because the pleasure
people derive from dessert

00:04:56.470 --> 00:04:58.770
may outweigh the
cost and discomfort

00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.900
of the dentist's chair.

00:04:59.900 --> 00:05:01.690
And look, that's fine.

00:05:01.690 --> 00:05:04.690
As long as people understand the
consequences of their actions,

00:05:04.690 --> 00:05:07.410
as a physician
what more can I do?

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.640
If you're an adult,
you decide the benefits

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:12.715
outweigh the risks for you and
your family, then go for it.

00:05:12.715 --> 00:05:15.270
I certainly enjoy the
occasional indulgence.

00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.210
I've got a good dental plan.

00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:21.710
But what if instead of
the plaque on our teeth,

00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.910
we're talking about
the plaque building

00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:28.450
up inside of our arteries,
another disease that can be

00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:30.330
prevented by changing our diet.

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:32.500
OK, now what are
the consequences

00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:34.170
for you and your family?

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:37.060
Now, we're not talking about
scraping tartar anymore.

00:05:37.060 --> 00:05:41.930
We're talking about
life and death.

00:05:41.930 --> 00:05:44.400
The most likely reason
your loved ones will die

00:05:44.400 --> 00:05:45.640
is heart disease.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.759
Now, it's still up to each of
us to make our own decisions as

00:05:48.759 --> 00:05:50.050
to what to eat and how to live.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:52.570
But we should make these
choices consciously,

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:56.400
educating ourselves about
the predictable consequences

00:05:56.400 --> 00:05:58.960
of our actions.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:00.970
Atherosclerosis,
hardening of the arteries,

00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:03.870
begins in childhood.

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:07.250
By age 10, the arteries
of nearly all kids

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:10.160
have fatty streaks, the
first stage of the disease.

00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:13.640
And then these plaques
are forming in our 20s,

00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:14.670
get worse in our 30s.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:16.137
And then can start
killing us off.

00:06:16.137 --> 00:06:17.845
In our heart, it's
called a heart attack.

00:06:17.845 --> 00:06:20.570
In our brain, the same
process is called a stroke.

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:29.970
If there is anyone here this
afternoon older than age 10,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.650
then the question
isn't whether or not

00:06:31.650 --> 00:06:34.700
to eat healthy to prevent
heart disease, but

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.460
whether or not you want to
reverse the heart disease

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:41.500
you likely already have.

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.400
But is that even possible?

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.400
When researchers took
people with heart disease,

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:49.020
put them on the kind of diet
followed by populations that

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:53.200
don't get heart
disease, we were hoping

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.010
to slow the
progression of these,

00:06:55.010 --> 00:06:58.280
maybe even stop, arrest it
from getting even worse.

00:06:58.280 --> 00:07:01.520
But instead, something
miraculous happened.

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:04.380
The disease started to reverse.

00:07:04.380 --> 00:07:07.450
As soon as patients stop
eating an artery-clogging diet,

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:10.400
their bodies were able to start
dissolving some of the plaque

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:11.110
away.

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.650
In some cases, even severe
triple-vessel heart disease

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:16.950
or arteries opening up without
drugs, without surgery.

00:07:16.950 --> 00:07:20.360
Suggesting that their bodies
wanted to be healthy all along,

00:07:20.360 --> 00:07:22.610
but were just never
given the chance.

00:07:22.610 --> 00:07:26.200
This improvement in
blood flow, on the left,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.272
was after just three
weeks of eating healthy.

00:07:31.272 --> 00:07:34.740
And let me share with you
what's been called the best kept

00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:37.890
secret in medicine.

00:07:37.890 --> 00:07:41.130
The best kept secret in medicine
is given the right conditions,

00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:45.020
the body can heal itself.

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:49.800
If you whack your shin really
hard on a coffee table,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.250
and get all red,
painful, hot, swollen,

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:57.910
but will heal naturally
if you just stand back

00:07:57.910 --> 00:08:05.420
and let your body's natural--
kind of your body's magic work.

00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.190
But what if you kept
hitting your shin

00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.490
in the same place every day?

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:14.300
In fact, three times a day,
breakfast, lunch, and dinner?

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.090
It'd never heal.

00:08:16.090 --> 00:08:17.430
You'd go to your doctors.

00:08:17.430 --> 00:08:19.319
You'd be like,
oh, my shin hurts.

00:08:19.319 --> 00:08:20.860
The doctor would be
like, no problem.

00:08:20.860 --> 00:08:24.060
Trained for this, whip out
their prescription pad,

00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.760
write you a prescription
for pain killers.

00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.320
You're still whacking your
shin three times a day.

00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:32.000
Oh, it still really
hurts like heck.

00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:38.931
But oh, it fells so much better
with those pain pills on board.

00:08:38.931 --> 00:08:42.059
And it's like when people
take nitroglycerin for angina,

00:08:42.059 --> 00:08:43.030
a crushing chest pain.

00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.450
A tremendous relief, but
you're not doing anything

00:08:45.450 --> 00:08:49.410
to treat the underlying cause.

00:08:49.410 --> 00:08:53.360
Our body wants to come back
to health if we let it.

00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.610
But if we keep reinjuring
it three times a day,

00:08:55.610 --> 00:08:57.415
it may never heal.

00:08:57.415 --> 00:08:59.144
Now, it's like smoking.

00:08:59.144 --> 00:09:00.810
One of the most amazing
things I learned

00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:03.740
in all my medical training
was that within 15 years

00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:07.550
of stopping smoking, your
lung cancer risk approaches

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:09.844
that of a lifelong nonsmoker.

00:09:09.844 --> 00:09:11.220
Isn't that amazing?

00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:13.740
Your body can like get
rid of all that tar.

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.770
And eventually, it's
almost as if you never

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:20.300
started smoking at all.

00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:23.350
And every morning of our smoking
life that healing process

00:09:23.350 --> 00:09:27.059
started until, wham, our
first cigarette of the day,

00:09:27.059 --> 00:09:28.600
reinjuring our lungs
with every puff,

00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:32.380
just like we can reinjure
our arteries with every bite.

00:09:32.380 --> 00:09:36.470
When all we had to
do, the miracle cure,

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.840
is to just stand back,
stop redamaging ourselves,

00:09:41.840 --> 00:09:45.890
and let our body's natural
healing processes bring us back

00:09:45.890 --> 00:09:47.500
towards health.

00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:51.940
Now, sure, you can choose
moderation and hit yourself

00:09:51.940 --> 00:09:55.650
with a smaller hammer.

00:09:55.650 --> 00:10:00.810
But why beat yourself up at all?

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:03.710
We've known about
this for decades.

00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:07.570
Note in "Heart Journal," 1977,
cases like Mr. F.W. here,

00:10:07.570 --> 00:10:11.460
such severe angina, couldn't
even make it to the mailbox.

00:10:11.460 --> 00:10:13.140
He started eating healthier.

00:10:13.140 --> 00:10:19.170
And a few months later, he was
climbing mountains, no pain.

00:10:19.170 --> 00:10:22.785
Now, there are new fancy new
anti-angina drugs out there,

00:10:22.785 --> 00:10:24.160
cost thousands of
dollars a year.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:27.840
And at the highest dose can
prolong exercise duration,

00:10:27.840 --> 00:10:30.060
prolong the period someone
can stand on a treadmill,

00:10:30.060 --> 00:10:34.590
as long as 33 and 1/2 seconds.

00:10:34.590 --> 00:10:36.090
It does not look
like those choosing

00:10:36.090 --> 00:10:39.700
the drug route are going
to be climbing mountains

00:10:39.700 --> 00:10:42.660
any time soon.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:43.160
You see.

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.300
So plant-based
diets can not only

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:50.870
be safer, cheaper,
but work better.

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:53.460
Killer number two is cancer.

00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:57.300
What happens if you put
cancer on a plant-based diet?

00:10:57.300 --> 00:10:59.026
Dr. Dean Ornish and
colleagues found

00:10:59.026 --> 00:11:00.650
that the progression
of prostate cancer

00:11:00.650 --> 00:11:03.120
could be reversed with
a plant-based diet

00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:04.620
and other healthy
lifestyle changes.

00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:06.170
And no wonder?

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:07.960
If you drip the
blood of those eating

00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:12.910
the standard American diet onto
cancer cells growing in a Petri

00:11:12.910 --> 00:11:15.830
dish-- these are human prostate
cancer cells-- cancer growth

00:11:15.830 --> 00:11:18.060
rate is cut down by about 9%.

00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:20.620
But put people on a plant-based
diet for a year though,

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:23.950
and their blood can do this.

00:11:23.950 --> 00:11:27.000
The blood circulating
throughout the bodies

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.730
of those eating
plant-based diets,

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.560
nearly eight times
the stopping power

00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:35.000
when it comes to
suppressing cancer growth.

00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.550
Now, this is for prostate
cancer, the number one cancer

00:11:39.550 --> 00:11:40.840
killer specific to men.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.450
For women, it's breast cancer.

00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:45.290
So researchers tried
duplicating this study

00:11:45.290 --> 00:11:47.710
with women and breast
cancer cells instead.

00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:49.690
But look, they didn't
want to wait a whole year

00:11:49.690 --> 00:11:50.520
to get the results.

00:11:50.520 --> 00:11:53.020
So they said, well, let's
see what a healthy diet can

00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.180
do after just two weeks
against three different types

00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.600
of human breast cancer?

00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.060
This is the before, cancer cell
growth powering away to 100%,

00:12:02.060 --> 00:12:05.450
and then after, eating a
plant-based diet for 14 days.

00:12:05.450 --> 00:12:08.680
Here's kind of a before
picture, a representative

00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:11.120
photomicrograph, a photograph
taken under a microscope.

00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:13.950
A layer of breast cancer
cells, a confluent layer,

00:12:13.950 --> 00:12:15.690
is laid down in a Petri dish.

00:12:15.690 --> 00:12:18.780
And then blood from women eating
the standard American diet

00:12:18.780 --> 00:12:20.350
is dripped on
those cancer cells.

00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:24.220
And as you can see, even people
eating pretty crappy diets

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.950
have some ability to kind
of break down cancer.

00:12:27.950 --> 00:12:30.290
But after just two
weeks eating healthy,

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:32.090
blood was drawn
from the same women.

00:12:32.090 --> 00:12:35.040
So they acted as their own
controls, the same women,

00:12:35.040 --> 00:12:36.360
two weeks later.

00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:39.910
And this is what
you're left with.

00:12:39.910 --> 00:12:42.900
So the same confluent layer
of kind of carpetive cancer

00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:43.690
is laid down.

00:12:43.690 --> 00:12:46.710
And just a few cells remain.

00:12:46.710 --> 00:12:52.680
Before and after, just
two weeks eating healthy.

00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:58.440
Their blood became that
much more hostile to cancer.

00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:00.375
Now slowing down the
growth of cancer is nice,

00:13:00.375 --> 00:13:01.750
getting rid of it
is even better.

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:04.476
This is what's called apoptosis,
programmed cell death.

00:13:04.476 --> 00:13:06.600
Our body is able to kind
of reprogram cancer cells,

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.534
forcing them into
early retirement.

00:13:08.534 --> 00:13:10.075
This is what's called
tunnel imaging.

00:13:10.075 --> 00:13:12.700
It measures DNA
fragmentation, cell death.

00:13:12.700 --> 00:13:15.610
So dying cells kind of light
up with little white spots.

00:13:15.610 --> 00:13:21.040
And as you can see, you're
not totally defenseless eating

00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.800
the standard American diet.

00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.300
But then you take these
same-- so her blood

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.335
can kill off a few.

00:13:28.335 --> 00:13:30.820
Same women, two
weeks later, 14 days

00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:34.010
of healthy plant-based living,
and their blood can do this.

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:40.730
It's like you're an entirely
different person inside.

00:13:40.730 --> 00:13:42.650
What kind of blood do
we want in the body,

00:13:42.650 --> 00:13:44.080
what kind of immune system?

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:47.100
Do we want blood that
just kind of rolls over

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:48.400
when new cancer cells pop up?

00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:50.275
Or do we want blood
circulating to every nook

00:13:50.275 --> 00:13:55.240
and cranny in our body, with the
power to slow down and stop it?

00:13:55.240 --> 00:13:57.967
The same blood, now coursing
through these women's bodies,

00:13:57.967 --> 00:13:59.550
gained the power to
significantly slow

00:13:59.550 --> 00:14:04.870
down and stop breast cancer cell
growth after just two weeks.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.365
Now, this dramatic
strengthening in cancer defenses

00:14:08.365 --> 00:14:11.270
was after two weeks
of diet and exercise.

00:14:11.270 --> 00:14:13.700
They had these women out
walking 30 to 60 minutes a day.

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:14.909
You say, well, wait a second.

00:14:14.909 --> 00:14:16.616
If you have two
interventions, how do you

00:14:16.616 --> 00:14:17.720
know what role diet plays?

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:23.669
So researchers decided
to put it to the test.

00:14:23.669 --> 00:14:26.210
This is measuring cancer cell
clearances, what we saw before,

00:14:26.210 --> 00:14:29.500
the effect of blood of those
who ate a plant-based diet,

00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.350
in this case for an
average of 14 years,

00:14:31.350 --> 00:14:34.760
along with mild exercise,
like walking every day.

00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:37.670
Compare that to your
cancer-stopping power

00:14:37.670 --> 00:14:39.590
of your average
sedentary meat eater--

00:14:39.590 --> 00:14:42.130
I put a little
burger there-- which

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.530
is essentially nonexistent.

00:14:44.530 --> 00:14:45.030
All right.

00:14:45.030 --> 00:14:50.910
But this middle group, this is
the interesting group, 14 years

00:14:50.910 --> 00:14:55.150
of standard American
diet, but 14 years

00:14:55.150 --> 00:14:59.860
of daily, strenuous, hour-long
exercise, like calisthenics.

00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:03.320
They wanted to know if you
exercise long enough, if you

00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:05.545
exercise hard
enough, can you rival

00:15:05.545 --> 00:15:08.210
some strolling plant eaters?

00:15:08.210 --> 00:15:13.070
And the answer is exercise
worked, no question.

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:17.010
But literally $5,000
hours in the gym

00:15:17.010 --> 00:15:20.920
appeared no match for
a plant-based diet.

00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:22.140
So the same thing as before.

00:15:22.140 --> 00:15:23.348
There is that tunnel imaging.

00:15:23.348 --> 00:15:25.700
Even if you're a couch
potato, eating fried potatoes,

00:15:25.700 --> 00:15:27.150
you are not totally defenseless.

00:15:27.150 --> 00:15:28.970
You can knock a
few cancer cells.

00:15:28.970 --> 00:15:31.330
If you exercise
strenuously an hour a day,

00:15:31.330 --> 00:15:33.450
you can knock off cancer
cells left and right.

00:15:33.450 --> 00:15:37.830
But nothing appears to
kick more cancer tush

00:15:37.830 --> 00:15:41.870
than a plant-based diet.

00:15:41.870 --> 00:15:43.580
We think it's because
of animal proteins.

00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:47.286
Meat, dairy, egg white proteins
increased the level of IGF-1

00:15:47.286 --> 00:15:48.910
in our body, insulin-like
growth factor

00:15:48.910 --> 00:15:51.514
1, which is a cancer-promoting
growth hormone involved

00:15:51.514 --> 00:15:52.930
in the acquisition
and progression

00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:53.980
of malignant tumors.

00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:56.522
But if we lower our animal
protein and, in fact,

00:15:56.522 --> 00:15:58.480
put people on a plant-based
diet for two weeks,

00:15:58.480 --> 00:15:59.649
the IGF-1 level drops.

00:15:59.649 --> 00:16:01.440
Put people on a
plant-based diet for years,

00:16:01.440 --> 00:16:05.150
it drops even further and their
levels of IGF-1 binding protein

00:16:05.150 --> 00:16:06.557
go up.

00:16:06.557 --> 00:16:08.890
IGF-1 binding protein, that's
one of our ways our bodies

00:16:08.890 --> 00:16:12.160
protects itself from cancer
from accelerated growth

00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.260
by releasing a binding
protein in the bloodstream

00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.141
to tie up any excess IGF-1.

00:16:16.141 --> 00:16:16.640
Sure.

00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:19.100
In as little as two
weeks, you can drop,

00:16:19.100 --> 00:16:20.929
you can force down the
production of IGF-1

00:16:20.929 --> 00:16:21.470
in your body.

00:16:21.470 --> 00:16:23.570
But what about the IGF-1 you
had from the bacon and eggs

00:16:23.570 --> 00:16:24.570
you had three weeks ago?

00:16:24.570 --> 00:16:27.100
Well, your liver releases
this snatch squad

00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.680
of binding proteins to pull
out any excess IGF-1 out

00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:30.500
of the system.

00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:31.830
It goes up after weeks.

00:16:31.830 --> 00:16:36.950
And benefits appear to
continue to accrue over years,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.116
the longer you eat healthy.

00:16:38.116 --> 00:16:39.490
Here's the experiment
that really

00:16:39.490 --> 00:16:41.180
nailed IGF-1 as the villain.

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.700
Same as last time, go on a
plant-based diet, cancer cell

00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:46.350
growth drops, cancer
cell death shoots up.

00:16:46.350 --> 00:16:48.170
But here's an
interesting column here.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.900
What if you add
back to the cancer

00:16:49.900 --> 00:16:52.270
just the amount of IGF-1
banished from your system

00:16:52.270 --> 00:16:53.550
by eating healthy?

00:16:53.550 --> 00:16:56.330
You erase the diet
and exercise effect.

00:16:56.330 --> 00:17:01.860
It's almost as if you never
started eating healthy at all.

00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:04.450
So the reason the
largest perspective

00:17:04.450 --> 00:17:07.040
study on diet and
cancer ever published

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.770
found that the instance
of all cancers combined

00:17:09.770 --> 00:17:13.046
was lower among those
eating meat-free diets

00:17:13.046 --> 00:17:15.170
may be because they're
eating less animal proteins.

00:17:15.170 --> 00:17:18.119
So they get less IGF-1 in their
system and less cancer growth.

00:17:18.119 --> 00:17:21.660
How much less cancer?

00:17:21.660 --> 00:17:24.510
Middle-aged men and women
with high protein intake, 75%

00:17:24.510 --> 00:17:27.300
increased total mortality
and four-fold increased

00:17:27.300 --> 00:17:28.500
risk of dying from cancer.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:32.890
But not all protein,
specifically animal protein,

00:17:32.890 --> 00:17:36.590
which makes sense given
the higher IGF-1 levels.

00:17:36.590 --> 00:17:40.290
The academic institution
sent out a press release

00:17:40.290 --> 00:17:44.620
with a memorable opening
line, "That chicken wing

00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:48.510
you're eating could be as
deadly as a cigarette."

00:17:48.510 --> 00:17:50.897
Explained that a diet
rich in animal proteins

00:17:50.897 --> 00:17:52.980
during middle age makes
you four times more likely

00:17:52.980 --> 00:17:56.510
to die from cancer, which
is comparable to smoking.

00:17:56.510 --> 00:17:59.114
What was the response
to this revelation

00:17:59.114 --> 00:18:00.780
that diets high in
meat, eggs, and dairy

00:18:00.780 --> 00:18:02.363
could be harmful of
health as smoking?

00:18:02.363 --> 00:18:05.690
Well, one nutrition
scientist replied

00:18:05.690 --> 00:18:09.047
that it would be potentially
dangerous to compare

00:18:09.047 --> 00:18:11.380
the effects of smoking with
the effects meat and cheese.

00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.670
Why?

00:18:12.670 --> 00:18:16.740
Because a smoker might think,
"why bother quitting smoking

00:18:16.740 --> 00:18:21.260
if my ham and cheese sandwich
is just as bad for me."

00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:24.430
So better not to tell anybody
about the whole meat and dairy

00:18:24.430 --> 00:18:26.130
thing.

00:18:26.130 --> 00:18:29.015
This reminds me of a
famous Philip Morris ad,

00:18:29.015 --> 00:18:32.380
a cigarette ad, that tried to
downplay the risk by saying,

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.950
look, you think
secondhand smoke is bad,

00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:38.210
increasing the risk of lung
cancer 19%, drinking one

00:18:38.210 --> 00:18:41.130
or two glasses of milk every
day may be three times as bad,

00:18:41.130 --> 00:18:45.630
62% increase in
risk of lung cancer;

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:48.120
or doubling the risk,
frequently cooking with oil;

00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:51.570
or tripling the risk of heart
disease eating non-vegetarian;

00:18:51.570 --> 00:18:53.020
or multiplying
your risk six-fold

00:18:53.020 --> 00:18:56.690
if you eat lots of meat and
dairy, more than average.

00:18:56.690 --> 00:19:00.772
So let's keep some
perspective here.

00:19:03.370 --> 00:19:06.580
The risk of lung cancer
from secondhand smoke

00:19:06.580 --> 00:19:09.910
may be well below
the risk reported

00:19:09.910 --> 00:19:11.760
for other everyday activity.

00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.385
So breathe deep.

00:19:16.385 --> 00:19:17.760
It's like saying,
ah, don't worry

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.200
about getting stabbed
because, pftt, getting shot

00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:23.180
is so much worse.

00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:25.220
How about neither?

00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:27.815
Two risks don't make a right.

00:19:27.815 --> 00:19:30.480
Now, of course, you'll
notice Philip Morris

00:19:30.480 --> 00:19:32.330
stopped throwing
dairy under the bus

00:19:32.330 --> 00:19:34.230
once they purchased Kraft Foods.

00:19:34.230 --> 00:19:36.990
But-- ahem.

00:19:36.990 --> 00:19:37.750
OK.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:39.990
Just 13 causes of death to go.

00:19:39.990 --> 00:19:41.180
All right.

00:19:41.180 --> 00:19:42.860
Let me quickly run
through the list.

00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:45.400
The top three killers used
to be a hard disease, cancer,

00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:46.000
and stroke.

00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:48.560
Oh, that's so 2007.

00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.810
Now it's heart
disease, cancer, COPD--

00:19:50.810 --> 00:19:53.300
chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease, like emphysema.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:56.384
Thankfully, COPD can be
prevented with the help

00:19:56.384 --> 00:19:57.300
of a plant-based diet.

00:19:57.300 --> 00:19:59.850
Even treated with plants,
if you want to check that,

00:19:59.850 --> 00:20:02.140
improving lung
function over time.

00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:05.190
The only intervention that's
been shown to do that.

00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.145
Of course, the tobacco industry
viewed these landmark findings

00:20:08.145 --> 00:20:09.020
a little differently.

00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:11.230
Instead of adding
plants to one's diet

00:20:11.230 --> 00:20:12.720
to prevent emphysema,
wouldn't it

00:20:12.720 --> 00:20:16.430
be easier to just add
them to cigarettes?

00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:20.770
And indeed, the addition of
acai berries to cigarettes

00:20:20.770 --> 00:20:23.300
evidently has a protective
effect against emphysema

00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:26.210
in smoking mice.

00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:28.340
Who would have thunk it, right?

00:20:28.340 --> 00:20:31.080
Next, they're going to start
putting berries in meat.

00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:34.230
And indeed, I couldn't
make this stuff up.

00:20:34.230 --> 00:20:36.370
Adding food extracts
to burger patties

00:20:36.370 --> 00:20:38.010
was not without its
glitches though.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:40.090
The blackberries
died, the burger

00:20:40.090 --> 00:20:44.030
patties with a distinct
purplish color, for example.

00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:46.750
They were infusing lamb
carcasses with kiwi fruit

00:20:46.750 --> 00:20:48.337
juice before rigor
mortis sets in.

00:20:48.337 --> 00:20:49.920
Evidently, it does
improve tenderness.

00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:53.140
You can even improve
the nutritional profile

00:20:53.140 --> 00:20:56.552
of frankfurters by adding
powdered grape seed.

00:20:56.552 --> 00:20:59.240
Though there were
complaints about grape seed

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:01.760
particles becoming visible
in the final product.

00:21:01.760 --> 00:21:04.420
And if there's one thing we
know about hot dog eaters

00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:09.150
is that they're picky about
what goes in their food.

00:21:09.150 --> 00:21:10.320
Oh, pig anus, oh.

00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:14.560
But grape seeds, ugh.

00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:16.571
Strokes, ah, killer number four.

00:21:16.571 --> 00:21:18.320
Preventing strokes may
be all about eating

00:21:18.320 --> 00:21:19.482
potassium-rich foods.

00:21:19.482 --> 00:21:20.940
Yet most Americans
don't even reach

00:21:20.940 --> 00:21:23.180
the recommended
minimum daily intake.

00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:27.670
And by most, I mean 98%.

00:21:27.670 --> 00:21:30.810
98% of us eat
potassium-deficient diets

00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.430
because 98% of us don't
eat enough plants.

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:37.640
Potassium comes from
the words, pot, ash.

00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.223
You take any plant
and put it in a pot

00:21:39.223 --> 00:21:42.610
and reduce it to ash, add
some water, boil it off.

00:21:42.610 --> 00:21:45.470
You're left with a white residue
at the bottom called potash.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:46.202
Yum, potassium.

00:21:46.202 --> 00:21:47.410
That's how they got the name.

00:21:47.410 --> 00:21:49.510
They used to called
it vegetable alkaloid.

00:21:49.510 --> 00:21:52.910
But I just say
that because that's

00:21:52.910 --> 00:21:56.220
a way to remember that that's
where potassium is largely

00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:56.910
found.

00:21:56.910 --> 00:21:59.725
But who can name me a food,
plant food, particularly high

00:21:59.725 --> 00:22:00.540
in potassium?

00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.370
Anybody?

00:22:01.370 --> 00:22:02.140
There's-- look.

00:22:02.140 --> 00:22:03.262
Hold it up.

00:22:03.262 --> 00:22:05.190
[LAUGHTER]

00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:08.380
I don't know why that's one
of the few things everybody

00:22:08.380 --> 00:22:11.820
knows about nutrition, bananas,
a good source of potassium.

00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:13.960
Chiquita must have a great
PR firm or something.

00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:18.160
It turns out bananas don't even
make the top 50 sources, coming

00:22:18.160 --> 00:22:22.600
here, coming in here right at
number 86, right behind fast

00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:23.790
food vanilla milkshakes.

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:27.580
It goes fast food
and then bananas.

00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:30.100
In fact, when I was putting
together the new book,

00:22:30.100 --> 00:22:32.630
I went back to see if the USDA
had updated their database.

00:22:32.630 --> 00:22:33.560
And they did.

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:36.820
And now, bananas don't
even make the top thousand,

00:22:36.820 --> 00:22:42.190
coming in at number 1,611,
right after Reese's Pieces.

00:22:42.190 --> 00:22:44.274
I'm serious.

00:22:44.274 --> 00:22:46.440
All right, bananas don't
even make the top thousand.

00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:49.140
In fact, if you look at the
next leading cause of death--

00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:52.437
but before, the top sources,
greens, beans, and dates,

00:22:52.437 --> 00:22:54.520
for those of you who really
want to know where you

00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.710
can find potassium,
whereas bananas

00:22:56.710 --> 00:22:59.357
don't even make the top list.

00:22:59.357 --> 00:23:01.690
In fact, if you look at the
next leading cause of death,

00:23:01.690 --> 00:23:04.225
bananas could be
downright dangerous.

00:23:04.225 --> 00:23:05.600
You've got to
watch out for them.

00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.135
Alzheimer's, now our
sixth leading killer,

00:23:11.135 --> 00:23:15.310
a staggering 4 million
Americans affected.

00:23:15.310 --> 00:23:17.380
20 years ago, it wasn't
even in the top 10

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:18.460
leading causes of death.

00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:20.251
According to the latest
dietary guidelines,

00:23:20.251 --> 00:23:22.650
for the prevention of
Alzheimer's disease,

00:23:22.650 --> 00:23:25.860
the two most important
things we can do

00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.410
is reduce our consumption
of meat, dairy, and junk

00:23:29.410 --> 00:23:33.250
and replace them with
vegetables, legumes,

00:23:33.250 --> 00:23:36.190
which means peas, chickpeas,
and lentils; fruits;

00:23:36.190 --> 00:23:39.000
and whole grains.

00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.490
This is based in part on data
going back over 20 years.

00:23:41.490 --> 00:23:43.830
Now, those who that eat
meat, red meat, white meat,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.430
it didn't matter, two to three
times more likely to become

00:23:46.430 --> 00:23:47.870
demented later in life.

00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.590
And the longer one
eats meat-free,

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:53.670
the lower one's risk
appears to drop.

00:23:53.670 --> 00:23:55.789
Next on the list
is type 2 diabetes,

00:23:55.789 --> 00:23:57.330
which can be prevented,
treated, even

00:23:57.330 --> 00:23:59.121
reversed with a
plant-based diet, something

00:23:59.121 --> 00:24:02.705
we've known since
back in the 1930s.

00:24:02.705 --> 00:24:04.830
Within five years, about
a quarter of the diabetics

00:24:04.830 --> 00:24:06.190
were off all insulin.

00:24:06.190 --> 00:24:08.460
But look, plant-based
diets are also

00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:11.292
relatively low calorie diets.

00:24:11.292 --> 00:24:13.250
Maybe the diabetes got
better just because they

00:24:13.250 --> 00:24:15.460
lost so much weight?

00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:19.350
In fact, stomach-stapling
surgery can reverse diabetes.

00:24:19.350 --> 00:24:21.070
So to choose diet,
what we would need

00:24:21.070 --> 00:24:23.540
is a study, where they put
people on a healthy diet,

00:24:23.540 --> 00:24:28.360
but forced them to eat so
much food that they would not

00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:29.365
lose any weight.

00:24:29.365 --> 00:24:30.990
Then we could say if
a plant-based diet

00:24:30.990 --> 00:24:34.250
had specific benefits beyond
just all the weight loss.

00:24:34.250 --> 00:24:36.200
We'd have to wait
another 44 years.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:38.637
But here it is.

00:24:38.637 --> 00:24:39.970
Subjects were weighed every day.

00:24:39.970 --> 00:24:41.470
If they started to
lose weight, they

00:24:41.470 --> 00:24:43.210
were made to eat more food.

00:24:43.210 --> 00:24:46.220
In fact, so much more
food, many of the subjects

00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:50.634
had problems eating it all,
like not another salad.

00:24:50.634 --> 00:24:51.800
But they eventually adapted.

00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.950
So no significant
alterations in body weight

00:24:53.950 --> 00:24:57.450
despite restricting meat,
eggs, dairy, and junk.

00:24:57.450 --> 00:25:02.170
So with zero weight loss, did
a plant-based diet still help?

00:25:02.170 --> 00:25:05.090
Overall, insulin requirements
were cut about 60%.

00:25:05.090 --> 00:25:08.870
And half were able to get
off of insulin all together,

00:25:08.870 --> 00:25:11.010
despite no change in weight.

00:25:11.010 --> 00:25:12.500
How many years did this take?

00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:13.590
No.

00:25:13.590 --> 00:25:21.330
16 days, an average
of 16 days later.

00:25:21.330 --> 00:25:23.620
So we're talking diabetics,
who have had diabetes

00:25:23.620 --> 00:25:25.730
for as long as 20
years, injecting

00:25:25.730 --> 00:25:30.320
20 units of insulin a day, and
then 13 days later, off all

00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.420
insulin.

00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:35.770
Here's patient 15, 32 units of
insulin on the control diet.

00:25:35.770 --> 00:25:39.110
And then 18 days later, on none.

00:25:39.110 --> 00:25:43.060
Actually lower blood sugars
on 32 units less insulin.

00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:48.040
That's the power of plants.

00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:50.620
And as a bonus, her cholesterol
dropped like a rock,

00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:53.740
down to under 150 in 16 days.

00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.160
So just like moderate
changes in diet typically

00:25:56.160 --> 00:25:58.330
only give us moderate
reductions in cholesterol,

00:25:58.330 --> 00:26:02.190
how moderate do you
want your diabetes?

00:26:02.190 --> 00:26:04.680
Everything in moderation
is a truer statement

00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:06.150
than many people may realize.

00:26:06.150 --> 00:26:08.590
And moderate changes
in diet can leave

00:26:08.590 --> 00:26:12.330
one with moderate
blindness, moderate kidney

00:26:12.330 --> 00:26:14.630
failure, moderate
amputat-- maybe just

00:26:14.630 --> 00:26:17.510
a few toes or something.

00:26:17.510 --> 00:26:22.240
Moderation in all things is
not necessarily a good thing.

00:26:22.240 --> 00:26:24.257
You know that study
that purported

00:26:24.257 --> 00:26:26.090
to show that diets high
in meat, eggs, dairy

00:26:26.090 --> 00:26:28.181
could be harmful to
health as smoking claims

00:26:28.181 --> 00:26:30.180
that those of you who
like meat, eggs, and dairy

00:26:30.180 --> 00:26:32.450
are four times more likely
to die from diabetes.

00:26:32.450 --> 00:26:34.590
But if you look at
the actual study,

00:26:34.590 --> 00:26:36.590
you'll see that's not true.

00:26:36.590 --> 00:26:39.160
Those eating lots
of animal protein

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:44.250
were not four times more
likely to die from diabetes.

00:26:44.250 --> 00:26:51.640
They had 73 times higher
risk of dying from diabetes,

00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:55.370
though that's quite a confidence
interval, as you can see.

00:26:55.370 --> 00:27:01.540
Now, those who chose moderation,
only eating a moderate amount

00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:08.852
of animal products, only had
23 times the risk of death

00:27:08.852 --> 00:27:09.435
from diabetes.

00:27:12.010 --> 00:27:15.920
Killer number eight
is kidney failure,

00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:17.810
which can be both
prevented and treated

00:27:17.810 --> 00:27:19.700
with a plant-based
diet, and no surprise.

00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:20.200
Why?

00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.300
Kidneys are highly
vascular organs.

00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:26.080
Harvard researchers found three
significant dietary factors

00:27:26.080 --> 00:27:28.770
associated with reducing kidney
function, declining kidney

00:27:28.770 --> 00:27:32.200
function, animal protein,
animal fat, and cholesterol.

00:27:32.200 --> 00:27:35.872
Animal fat can alter the
actual structure of the kidneys

00:27:35.872 --> 00:27:37.330
based on studies
like this, showing

00:27:37.330 --> 00:27:39.440
plugs of fat basically
kind of clogging up

00:27:39.440 --> 00:27:42.070
the works in autopsied
human kidneys.

00:27:42.070 --> 00:27:45.030
And the animal protein
can have a profound effect

00:27:45.030 --> 00:27:47.690
on kidney function,
inducing what's

00:27:47.690 --> 00:27:50.076
called hyperfiltration,
increasing

00:27:50.076 --> 00:27:51.200
the workload on the kidney.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:53.850
But not, interestingly,
plant protein.

00:27:53.850 --> 00:27:56.677
So you eat a meal of tuna fish.

00:27:56.677 --> 00:27:58.760
And you can see increased
pressure in the kidneys,

00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.870
going up one, two, three
hours after the meal.

00:28:02.870 --> 00:28:05.720
But if instead of a
tuna salad sandwich,

00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:09.030
you had a tofu salad
sandwich, with the same amount

00:28:09.030 --> 00:28:12.200
of protein, no effect.

00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:16.890
It's no problem for our kidneys
to deal with plant protein.

00:28:16.890 --> 00:28:19.880
Why does animal protein cause
this overload reaction, but not

00:28:19.880 --> 00:28:20.530
plant protein?

00:28:20.530 --> 00:28:23.560
Well, it appears to be due
to inflammation triggered

00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:25.120
by the animal protein.

00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:27.000
We know this
because you can give

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:31.130
this powerful anti-inflammatory
drug, along with the tuna fish,

00:28:31.130 --> 00:28:33.620
and you can abolish
that hyperfiltration,

00:28:33.620 --> 00:28:35.560
that kind of protein
leakage effect,

00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.550
in response to meat ingestion.

00:28:38.550 --> 00:28:40.630
Then there's the acid load.

00:28:40.630 --> 00:28:42.220
Animal protein
induces the formation

00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:43.830
of acid in the
kidneys, which can

00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:46.240
lead to what's called
tubular toxicity, damage

00:28:46.240 --> 00:28:49.750
to the kind of little
delicate urine-making tubes

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.130
in the kidneys.

00:28:52.130 --> 00:28:54.690
Animal proteins, in general,
animal foods, in general,

00:28:54.690 --> 00:28:57.360
tend to be acid forming,
whereas plant foods tend

00:28:57.360 --> 00:29:00.630
to be relatively neutral
or actually alkaline,

00:29:00.630 --> 00:29:04.290
base forming within the kidneys,
to counter some of that acid.

00:29:04.290 --> 00:29:07.090
So the key to halting the
progression of chronic kidney

00:29:07.090 --> 00:29:11.580
disease might be in the
produce market, rather than

00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:13.089
the pharmacy.

00:29:13.089 --> 00:29:14.630
No wonder plant-based
diets have been

00:29:14.630 --> 00:29:17.540
used to treat kidney
disease for decades.

00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.430
Here's protein leakage on the
conventional low-sodium diet,

00:29:21.430 --> 00:29:25.020
which we physicians
tend to put people on.

00:29:25.020 --> 00:29:29.900
But then if you switch them
to a supplemented vegan diet,

00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:33.072
then back to conventional, then
back to plant-based, then back

00:29:33.072 --> 00:29:34.780
to conventional, the
back to plant-based,

00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:38.030
you can switch on and
off kidney dysfunction,

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:42.790
like a light switch, based on
what goes into people's mouth.

00:29:42.790 --> 00:29:46.300
Kidney number nine-- killer
number-- kidney number nine.

00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:49.200
Killer number nine is
respiratory infections.

00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:52.650
What possible role
could diet play there?

00:29:52.650 --> 00:29:54.590
Here we are in flu season.

00:29:54.590 --> 00:29:57.970
Well, you obviously haven't seen
my video, "Kale and the Immune

00:29:57.970 --> 00:30:00.940
System," talking about the
immunostimulatory effects

00:30:00.940 --> 00:30:01.440
of kale.

00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.540
Is there anything
that kale cannot do?

00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:08.530
Boosting antibody
production seven-fold,

00:30:08.530 --> 00:30:10.650
but this is in vitro,
in a Petri dish.

00:30:10.650 --> 00:30:12.689
What about in people?

00:30:12.689 --> 00:30:14.480
Older men and women,
split into two groups,

00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:16.188
right before their
pneumovax vaccination,

00:30:16.188 --> 00:30:18.630
their pneumonia vaccination.

00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:20.172
And they split
them in two groups.

00:30:20.172 --> 00:30:22.130
One group continued to
eat, as they always had.

00:30:22.130 --> 00:30:23.810
The other group added
just a few servings

00:30:23.810 --> 00:30:24.890
of fruits and vegetables
to their diet.

00:30:24.890 --> 00:30:26.264
You see a significant
improvement

00:30:26.264 --> 00:30:29.051
to protective antibody response,
just a few extra servings

00:30:29.051 --> 00:30:30.050
of fruits and vegetables

00:30:30.050 --> 00:30:31.830
This wasn't cutting
out meat or anything.

00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:34.380
Just adding some fruits and
vegetables to their daily diet

00:30:34.380 --> 00:30:39.240
could significantly boost their
protective immune function.

00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:42.320
Killing number 10 is suicide.

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.640
Now, we've known that
people who eat healthier

00:30:44.640 --> 00:30:48.380
tend to have
healthier mood states.

00:30:48.380 --> 00:30:51.150
Typically, only
about half the levels

00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:54.480
of depression, anxiety,
and stress using these kind

00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:57.150
of validated scoring systems.

00:30:57.150 --> 00:31:00.020
Researchers suspect that
if the arachidonic acid,

00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.830
this inflammatory
omega-6 fatty acid,

00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:06.080
found predominantly in chicken
and eggs in the American diet--

00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:08.550
we can't tell if it's cause
and effect until you put it

00:31:08.550 --> 00:31:09.420
to the test.

00:31:09.420 --> 00:31:12.003
So they took people eating the
standard American diet, removed

00:31:12.003 --> 00:31:14.710
eggs, removed
poultry, as well as

00:31:14.710 --> 00:31:16.390
other meats from their diets.

00:31:16.390 --> 00:31:21.370
Got a significant improvement
in mood within just two weeks.

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:24.150
Thanks, perhaps, to the
removal of arachidonic acid

00:31:24.150 --> 00:31:26.170
from their diet,
which they thought

00:31:26.170 --> 00:31:30.170
was adversely impacting their
mental health via a cascade

00:31:30.170 --> 00:31:31.670
of neuroinflammation.

00:31:31.670 --> 00:31:33.430
They thought this
arachidonic acid

00:31:33.430 --> 00:31:34.690
was inflaming their brains.

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:37.926
But within just two
weeks of cutting out

00:31:37.926 --> 00:31:39.300
eggs, chicken,
and other meat you

00:31:39.300 --> 00:31:41.340
could clear up
that inflammation.

00:31:41.340 --> 00:31:43.930
Now, am I just cherry
picking though?

00:31:43.930 --> 00:31:45.837
What about all of
the other randomized

00:31:45.837 --> 00:31:47.420
controlled clinical
trials that showed

00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:50.820
different diets improve mood?

00:31:50.820 --> 00:31:52.610
There aren't any.

00:31:52.610 --> 00:31:55.920
A recent review concluded
that only the plant-based diet

00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.326
has ever been shown to do that.

00:31:57.326 --> 00:31:58.450
Only that one fit the bill.

00:31:58.450 --> 00:32:03.990
It's hard to cherry pick
when there's only one cherry.

00:32:03.990 --> 00:32:05.990
It works in the
workplace setting too,

00:32:05.990 --> 00:32:09.220
as I was happy to see all the
fruits and veggies as I walked

00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:10.980
around on the floors here.

00:32:10.980 --> 00:32:14.134
Significant increases
in physical functioning,

00:32:14.134 --> 00:32:15.800
general health,
vitality, mental health.

00:32:15.800 --> 00:32:18.890
Not surprisingly, it translates
in improved work productivity.

00:32:18.890 --> 00:32:23.440
The biggest such study,
which was 10 corporate sites

00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:25.550
at Geico, found that
plant-based diets

00:32:25.550 --> 00:32:28.410
could result in significant
improvements in depression,

00:32:28.410 --> 00:32:31.150
anxiety, fatigue, emotional
well-being, daily functioning,

00:32:31.150 --> 00:32:32.890
emotional health, et cetera.

00:32:32.890 --> 00:32:36.210
Lifestyle interventions
such as exercise can help.

00:32:36.210 --> 00:32:38.160
But in terms of diet,
plant-based diets

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:42.350
appear to have the most
data to support them.

00:32:42.350 --> 00:32:45.090
Killer number 11
is blood infection.

00:32:45.090 --> 00:32:47.980
Now, sure, food-borne bacteria
can directly kind of burrow

00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:50.690
through the intestinal wall into
your bloodstream or in women

00:32:50.690 --> 00:32:52.750
can creep up into their bladder.

00:32:52.750 --> 00:32:55.510
We've know for decades that
it's bacteria creeping up

00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.990
from the rectum that
causes bladder infections.

00:32:57.990 --> 00:33:00.000
But only recently
did we figure out

00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:04.790
where this rectal reservoir
of UTI bacteria-- infecting

00:33:04.790 --> 00:33:06.230
E. coli-- was coming from.

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:07.660
And that is chicken.

00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:09.766
We now have DNA
fingerprinting proof

00:33:09.766 --> 00:33:11.515
of a direct link between
the farm animals,

00:33:11.515 --> 00:33:13.530
and the meat, and then
bladder infections.

00:33:13.530 --> 00:33:16.340
Solid evidence that urinary
tract infections in people

00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:20.750
can be what's called a zoonosis,
an animal to human disease.

00:33:20.750 --> 00:33:21.940
Wait a second.

00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:23.770
Can't I just use a
meat thermometer,

00:33:23.770 --> 00:33:26.580
cook the meat through?

00:33:26.580 --> 00:33:29.116
Unfortunately, no, because
of cross-contamination.

00:33:29.116 --> 00:33:32.130
We've known for decades, you
give someone a frozen chicken--

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:34.312
in fact, you give 40
households a frozen chicken

00:33:34.312 --> 00:33:36.020
to prepare and cook
in their own kitchen,

00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:39.960
as they normally
would, and a multitude

00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:42.880
of antibiotic-resistant chicken
bacteria jump from the chicken

00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:47.860
into the gut of the volunteers
before they even eat it.

00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.320
So you could incinerate
that chicken to ash,

00:33:50.320 --> 00:33:51.169
it doesn't matter.

00:33:51.169 --> 00:33:52.460
You don't even have to eat any.

00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:56.250
It's just handling
it in the kitchen.

00:33:56.250 --> 00:33:58.300
Within days, the
drug-resistant chicken bacteria

00:33:58.300 --> 00:34:01.420
had multiplied to the point
of becoming a major part

00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:03.040
of the person's gut flora.

00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:05.950
The chicken bacteria is
kind of like taking over.

00:34:05.950 --> 00:34:10.370
Even if you follow safe handling
practices, in addition to

00:34:10.370 --> 00:34:12.550
safe cooking practices--
rinsing everything

00:34:12.550 --> 00:34:13.960
is the official recommendation.

00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.793
Rinsing everything with
bleach and then they

00:34:15.793 --> 00:34:19.239
went in an sprayed a dilute
bleach solution on everything,

00:34:19.239 --> 00:34:23.240
you still may be leaving
pathogenic fecal bacteria

00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:23.739
behind.

00:34:23.739 --> 00:34:25.219
This is Salmonella,
Campylobacter,

00:34:25.219 --> 00:34:28.170
both serious human pathogens.

00:34:28.170 --> 00:34:31.469
The reason people
have more bacteria

00:34:31.469 --> 00:34:37.440
from feces in their kitchen
sink than on their toilet seat

00:34:37.440 --> 00:34:41.770
is because people aren't rinsing
their chickens in the toilet.

00:34:41.770 --> 00:34:45.340
They're rinsing
them in the sink.

00:34:45.340 --> 00:34:48.750
So unless our kitchen is
like some biohazard lab,

00:34:48.750 --> 00:34:51.408
the only way to guarantee we're
not going to leave infection

00:34:51.408 --> 00:34:52.949
around the kitchen
is to not bring it

00:34:52.949 --> 00:34:55.199
into our homes in
the first place.

00:34:55.199 --> 00:34:57.550
But the good news is it's
not like you eat chicken once

00:34:57.550 --> 00:34:59.540
and you're colonized for life.

00:34:59.540 --> 00:35:03.360
This chicken in this study,
the chicken bacteria,

00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.010
only seem to last about 10
days before good bacteria was

00:35:07.010 --> 00:35:09.470
able to kind of muscle
it out of the way.

00:35:09.470 --> 00:35:11.790
The problem is many families
eat chicken more than once

00:35:11.790 --> 00:35:12.620
every 10 days.

00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:15.410
And so may be kind of constantly
reintroducing the chicken

00:35:15.410 --> 00:35:17.426
virus into their systems.

00:35:17.426 --> 00:35:18.050
Wait, a second.

00:35:18.050 --> 00:35:19.670
You can't sell unsafe cars.

00:35:19.670 --> 00:35:20.770
You can it's unsafe toys.

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:24.360
How is it even illegal
to sell unsafe meat?

00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.470
Well, they do it by
blaming the consumers.

00:35:27.470 --> 00:35:30.030
One USDA poultry microbiologist
said, look, raw meats

00:35:30.030 --> 00:35:31.130
are not idiot proof.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:32.480
They can be mishandled.

00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:34.521
When they are, it's like
handling a hang grenade.

00:35:34.521 --> 00:35:37.830
You pull the pin, someone
is going to go hurt.

00:35:37.830 --> 00:35:40.410
See, we get sick,
it's our fault.

00:35:40.410 --> 00:35:43.040
Now, while some may
question the wisdom

00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:45.490
of selling hand grenades
in supermarkets,

00:35:45.490 --> 00:35:47.300
the USDA poultry
expert disagrees.

00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:49.320
I think the consumer
is most responsible,

00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:51.010
just refused to accept it.

00:35:51.010 --> 00:35:52.580
I think a car
company saying, yeah,

00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.950
we installed faulty brakes.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:56.680
But it's your fault for
not putting your kid

00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.790
in a seat belt.

00:35:58.790 --> 00:36:01.720
The head of the CDC'S food
poisoning division famously

00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.350
responded to this kind of
blame-the-victim attitude

00:36:04.350 --> 00:36:05.660
coming from the meat industry.

00:36:05.660 --> 00:36:08.380
Is it reasonable, she
asked, is it reasonable

00:36:08.380 --> 00:36:10.380
that if a consumer
undercooks a hamburger,

00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:12.710
their three-year-old die?

00:36:12.710 --> 00:36:15.680
Is that reasonable?

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:18.370
Not to worry though, the
meat industry's on it.

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:21.550
They just got FDA approval
for a bacteria-eating virus

00:36:21.550 --> 00:36:23.060
to spray on the meat.

00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.650
And now the industry
is concerned

00:36:24.650 --> 00:36:26.920
about the so-called
bacteria phages.

00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:29.400
That may somewhat of a challenge
to the food industries.

00:36:29.400 --> 00:36:30.940
So, of course, they're going
to label it or anything.

00:36:30.940 --> 00:36:33.280
But they think that's
got to be a challenge.

00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:35.290
Check out their
other bright idea.

00:36:35.290 --> 00:36:38.210
This is the effect
of extracted housefly

00:36:38.210 --> 00:36:39.691
pupae on pork presence.

00:36:39.691 --> 00:36:41.690
This is a sciencey way
of saying I want to smear

00:36:41.690 --> 00:36:43.771
a maggot mixture on the meat.

00:36:43.771 --> 00:36:44.270
Wait.

00:36:44.270 --> 00:36:46.630
It's low cost and simple.

00:36:46.630 --> 00:36:49.030
Think about it, right.

00:36:49.030 --> 00:36:51.850
Maggots live off
of rotting flesh.

00:36:51.850 --> 00:36:54.730
However, at the
same time, there's

00:36:54.730 --> 00:36:57.930
no reports of maggots
having any serious diseases.

00:36:57.930 --> 00:37:00.500
So they must be filled with
some kind of antibacteria,

00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.535
something.

00:37:01.535 --> 00:37:03.740
So let's take some
maggots, grow them up.

00:37:03.740 --> 00:37:05.124
Three days old, wash them off.

00:37:05.124 --> 00:37:07.040
Towel them off, a little
Vitamix action there.

00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.325
And voila, safer meat.

00:37:12.784 --> 00:37:13.700
We did kidney failure.

00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:15.480
What about liver failure?

00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.750
We've known for decades
that a plant-based diet can

00:37:18.750 --> 00:37:21.734
be used to treat liver
failure, significantly reducing

00:37:21.734 --> 00:37:23.900
the toxins that would
otherwise build up eating meat

00:37:23.900 --> 00:37:26.640
without a fully functional liver
just to detoxify your blood.

00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:28.410
One does have to admit,
though, that there

00:37:28.410 --> 00:37:30.150
are some people eating
plant-based diets

00:37:30.150 --> 00:37:33.350
with worsening liver function.

00:37:33.350 --> 00:37:36.350
They're called
alcoholics, living off

00:37:36.350 --> 00:37:39.080
of potatoes, and corn,
and grapes, and barley.

00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:40.410
In fact, strictly plant-based.

00:37:40.410 --> 00:37:41.870
But they're not doing so well.

00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.250
It's not clear what the--

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.560
High blood pressure
is next, affecting

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.230
nearly 78 million Americans.

00:37:49.230 --> 00:37:50.385
That's one in three of us.

00:37:50.385 --> 00:37:52.510
And as we age, our pressures
get higher and higher.

00:37:52.510 --> 00:37:57.492
Such that by age 60, it
strikes more than half.

00:37:57.492 --> 00:37:58.200
So wait a second.

00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.130
If it effects most of
us when we get older,

00:38:00.130 --> 00:38:02.360
maybe it's less a
disease and really just

00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:06.770
kind of an inevitable
consequence of aging?

00:38:06.770 --> 00:38:07.270
No.

00:38:07.270 --> 00:38:10.610
We've known since the 1920s that
high blood pressure need not

00:38:10.610 --> 00:38:11.190
occur.

00:38:11.190 --> 00:38:12.530
Researchers measured
the blood pressure

00:38:12.530 --> 00:38:14.030
of a thousand people
in rural Kenya,

00:38:14.030 --> 00:38:16.740
who ate a diet centered around
whole plant foods, whole

00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:18.270
grains, beans,
vegetables, fruit,

00:38:18.270 --> 00:38:19.480
dark-green leafy vegetables.

00:38:19.480 --> 00:38:23.240
Our pressures go up as we age.

00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:28.140
And their pressures actually
get better as they get older.

00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.600
And the lower, the better.

00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.970
This whole 140 over 90
cutoff is arbitrary.

00:38:32.970 --> 00:38:34.710
Even people who start
out with a blood

00:38:34.710 --> 00:38:37.090
pressure of so-called
normal, 120 over 80,

00:38:37.090 --> 00:38:40.150
appear to benefit from
blood pressure reduction.

00:38:40.150 --> 00:38:43.930
So the ideal blood pressure,
the no-benefit from reducing it

00:38:43.930 --> 00:38:49.310
further blood pressure,
is actually 110 over 70.

00:38:49.310 --> 00:38:52.560
Isn't it even possible to get
pressures down to 110 over 70?

00:38:52.560 --> 00:38:56.830
It's not just possible,
it's normal for people

00:38:56.830 --> 00:38:59.240
eating healthy enough diets.

00:38:59.240 --> 00:39:02.000
So for two years at a rural
Kenyan hospital, 1,800 patients

00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.510
admitted, how many cases of high
blood pressure did they find?

00:39:05.510 --> 00:39:06.066
Zero.

00:39:06.066 --> 00:39:08.440
Ah, they must have had low
rates of heart disease, right?

00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:08.940
No.

00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.910
They had no rates
of heart disease,

00:39:10.910 --> 00:39:13.900
not a single case
of atherosclerosis,

00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:17.210
arteriosclerosis, our number
one killer, was found.

00:39:17.210 --> 00:39:22.010
Rural China too, by 110
over 70 their entire lives.

00:39:22.010 --> 00:39:26.150
70-year-old, same blood
pressure as a 16-year-old.

00:39:26.150 --> 00:39:29.180
Now, look, Africa, China,
vastly different diets.

00:39:29.180 --> 00:39:31.000
But what do they hold in common?

00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.200
The common theme, they're
plant-based day to day,

00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:35.790
with meat only eaten
on special occasions.

00:39:35.790 --> 00:39:38.120
Now, why do we think it's
the plant-based nature

00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.920
of their diets though?

00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.040
Because in the Western world, as
the American Heart Association

00:39:44.040 --> 00:39:47.260
pointed out, the only folks that
are getting it down that low

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:53.669
are the strict vegetarians,
coming in at 110 over 65.

00:39:53.669 --> 00:39:56.210
Based on the largest study of
those eating a plant-based diet

00:39:56.210 --> 00:39:58.840
to date, that is
89,000 Californians,

00:39:58.840 --> 00:40:02.020
there appears to be a stepwise
drop in high blood pressure

00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.370
rates as one gets more
and more plant-based.

00:40:04.370 --> 00:40:09.110
So this is starting out
a regular meat eater.

00:40:09.110 --> 00:40:13.363
The control group actually
only ate serving or two

00:40:13.363 --> 00:40:13.980
of meat a day.

00:40:13.980 --> 00:40:15.730
So kind of a low meat eater.

00:40:15.730 --> 00:40:17.900
Compared to a semi-vegetarian
or a flexitarian,

00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:19.830
who only meat like
on a weekly basis,

00:40:19.830 --> 00:40:21.280
as opposed to a daily basis.

00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:22.961
Those that ate no
meat except fish,

00:40:22.961 --> 00:40:25.460
just eggs and dairy, or those
that ate strictly plant-based.

00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:28.640
You see the same thing with
diabetes, a stepwise drop

00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:31.700
in diabetes rates as one's diet
gets more and more plant-based.

00:40:31.700 --> 00:40:34.660
And the same thing with obesity,
anything over 25 is overweight.

00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.980
Even vegetarians in
the US are overweight.

00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:39.800
The only dietary group that
met the, quote, unquote,

00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.660
"ideal body weight" were those
eating strictly plant-based.

00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:45.331
But as you can see, look,
it's not black and white.

00:40:45.331 --> 00:40:46.330
It's not all or nothing.

00:40:46.330 --> 00:40:50.080
Any steps we can make
along that spectrum

00:40:50.080 --> 00:40:52.906
may accrue significant benefits.

00:40:52.906 --> 00:40:54.280
You can show this
experimentally.

00:40:54.280 --> 00:40:56.107
You take vegetarians,
you give them meat.

00:40:56.107 --> 00:40:57.690
What happens to their
blood pressures?

00:40:57.690 --> 00:40:59.630
They go up.

00:40:59.630 --> 00:41:02.000
Or you take some meat
eaters, remove meat,

00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.380
and the blood pressures
go down within seven days.

00:41:06.380 --> 00:41:08.770
And this is after the vast
majority already reduced

00:41:08.770 --> 00:41:13.370
their blood pressure medications
or eliminated them completely.

00:41:13.370 --> 00:41:15.354
They had to, otherwise
their blood pressures

00:41:15.354 --> 00:41:17.020
would bottom out
because you're actually

00:41:17.020 --> 00:41:19.139
treating the cause of
their blood pressure.

00:41:19.139 --> 00:41:20.930
And so you can't be on
blood pressure drugs

00:41:20.930 --> 00:41:22.690
if you have normal
blood pressure.

00:41:22.690 --> 00:41:25.150
Lower pressures on fewer drugs.

00:41:25.150 --> 00:41:29.140
That's the power of plants.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:30.940
So does the American
Heart Association

00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:32.780
recommend a no-meat diet?

00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:33.280
No.

00:41:33.280 --> 00:41:36.270
They recommend a low meat
diet, the so-called DASH diet.

00:41:36.270 --> 00:41:37.860
Why not vegetarian?

00:41:37.860 --> 00:41:40.060
When the DASH diet
was created, were they

00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:42.320
just not aware of
this landmark research

00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:45.510
done by Harvard's Frank Sacks?

00:41:45.510 --> 00:41:46.010
No.

00:41:46.010 --> 00:41:47.220
They were aware.

00:41:47.220 --> 00:41:50.020
The chair of the committee
that came up with the DASH diet

00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:53.605
was Frank Sacks.

00:41:53.605 --> 00:41:57.030
You see, the DASH diet
was explicitly designed.

00:41:57.030 --> 00:41:59.940
The number one goal of
capturing the blood pressure

00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:01.730
lowering benefits of
a vegetarian diet,

00:42:01.730 --> 00:42:05.660
yet contain enough
animal products

00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:08.510
to make them palatable
to the general public.

00:42:08.510 --> 00:42:12.810
They didn't think the public
could quite handle the truth.

00:42:12.810 --> 00:42:14.610
Now, but in their
defense you can

00:42:14.610 --> 00:42:16.050
see what they were thinking.

00:42:16.050 --> 00:42:21.480
I mean just like drugs never
work unless you actually

00:42:21.480 --> 00:42:24.702
take them, diets never work
unless you actually eat them.

00:42:24.702 --> 00:42:26.910
They're like, well, no one's
going to eat vegetarian.

00:42:26.910 --> 00:42:32.570
So maybe on a population scale,
if they kind of soft-pedal it,

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:36.190
then we'd actually save
more lives overall.

00:42:36.190 --> 00:42:40.890
But tell that to the
thousand families a day

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:44.630
that lose a loved one
to high blood pressure.

00:42:44.630 --> 00:42:51.230
Maybe it's time to start
telling Americans the truth.

00:42:51.230 --> 00:42:53.550
Killer number 14 is
Parkinson's disease.

00:42:53.550 --> 00:42:55.980
Does a plant-based diet reduce
the risk of Parkinson's?

00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:59.450
Well, most studies to date
suggest a link between dairy

00:42:59.450 --> 00:43:00.650
products and Parkinson's.

00:43:00.650 --> 00:43:01.670
But why?

00:43:01.670 --> 00:43:04.720
Well, there's evidence
that milk is contaminated

00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.240
with neurotoxic chemicals.

00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:08.510
High levels of pesticide
residues, for example,

00:43:08.510 --> 00:43:10.850
found in milk and in the
brains of Parkinson's victims.

00:43:10.850 --> 00:43:14.020
We're talking about pollutants
like tetrahydroisoquinoline

00:43:14.020 --> 00:43:15.940
here, which is actually
what scientists

00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:18.840
use to induce Parkinsonism
in primates in the lab.

00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:20.590
It's found mostly
in cheese actually.

00:43:20.590 --> 00:43:22.820
So maybe the dairy
industry should require

00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:24.550
toxin screenings of milk.

00:43:24.550 --> 00:43:26.340
Good luck with that.

00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.940
You can always
just not drink it.

00:43:27.940 --> 00:43:34.370
But then what would
happen to your bones?

00:43:34.370 --> 00:43:37.115
That's a marketing ploy,
if you look at the science.

00:43:37.115 --> 00:43:39.634
Milk does not appear to protect
against hip fracture risk,

00:43:39.634 --> 00:43:41.300
whether drinking
during your adult years

00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:42.966
or drinking milk
during your teen years.

00:43:42.966 --> 00:43:43.870
It doesn't matter.

00:43:43.870 --> 00:43:46.650
If anything, milk was
associated with an increase

00:43:46.650 --> 00:43:47.570
in fracture risk.

00:43:47.570 --> 00:43:50.140
Maybe that's why we
see higher hip fracture

00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:53.900
rates among the populations with
the greatest milk consumption.

00:43:53.900 --> 00:43:56.590
So Swedish researchers
decided to put it

00:43:56.590 --> 00:43:58.560
to the test, a hundred
thousand men and women

00:43:58.560 --> 00:43:59.790
followed for up to 20 years.

00:43:59.790 --> 00:44:04.470
And milk-drinking women
had higher rates of death.

00:44:04.470 --> 00:44:07.670
More heart disease,
significantly more cancer,

00:44:07.670 --> 00:44:10.150
associated with each daily
glass of milk consumption.

00:44:10.150 --> 00:44:17.600
Three glasses a day,
that's about a twofold risk

00:44:17.600 --> 00:44:21.200
of overall mortality, all-cause
mortality, risk of death.

00:44:21.200 --> 00:44:24.350
And they had significantly more
bone and hip fractures too,

00:44:24.350 --> 00:44:26.502
more milk, more fractures.

00:44:26.502 --> 00:44:29.800
Milk-drinking men also had
a higher risk of death.

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:33.650
But for some reason, you
never see milk ads like this.

00:44:33.650 --> 00:44:36.090
I'm not sure why.

00:44:36.090 --> 00:44:37.869
Finally, aspiration
pneumonia, which

00:44:37.869 --> 00:44:40.160
is caused by swallowing
problems due to Parkinson's, or

00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.450
Alzheimer's, or stroke, things
that we've already covered.

00:44:42.450 --> 00:44:43.616
So where does this leave us?

00:44:43.616 --> 00:44:48.390
Here are the 15 leading
reasons Americans die.

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:52.300
And a plant-based diet can help
prevent nearly all of them.

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.890
Can help treat more
than half of them.

00:44:54.890 --> 00:44:57.930
In some cases, even
reverse the progression

00:44:57.930 --> 00:45:02.990
of disease in some cases,
including sometimes

00:45:02.990 --> 00:45:04.020
our top three killers.

00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:06.390
Now, look, there are
drugs that can help too.

00:45:06.390 --> 00:45:08.520
You take one drug,
cholesterol-lowering drugs,

00:45:08.520 --> 00:45:10.140
every day for the rest of your
life to help with your heart.

00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.010
Usually it takes
a couple families

00:45:12.010 --> 00:45:13.930
of blood pressure
lowering pills.

00:45:13.930 --> 00:45:17.620
Or you can insulin injections
to control your blood sugars.

00:45:17.620 --> 00:45:21.510
But the same diet,
though, does it all.

00:45:21.510 --> 00:45:24.050
So it's not like there's
one liver or a healthy diet.

00:45:24.050 --> 00:45:26.550
I know you want to go on the
heart healthy diet or the brain

00:45:26.550 --> 00:45:26.980
healthy diet.

00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:28.896
A liver healthy diet is
a kidney healthy diet,

00:45:28.896 --> 00:45:31.480
is a body healthy diet.

00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:34.966
One diet to rule them all.

00:45:34.966 --> 00:45:36.340
And what about
drug side effects?

00:45:36.340 --> 00:45:38.048
I'm not talking about
a little rash here.

00:45:38.048 --> 00:45:39.180
Side effects kill.

00:45:39.180 --> 00:45:42.492
Prescription drugs kill
more than a hundred

00:45:42.492 --> 00:45:45.680
thousand Americans every year.

00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:46.930
Wait a second.

00:45:46.930 --> 00:45:50.980
106,000 deaths a year from
adverse drug side effects.

00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:53.680
That means the sixth
leading cause of death

00:45:53.680 --> 00:45:56.170
is actually doctors.

00:45:56.170 --> 00:45:59.134
The sixth leading
cause of death is me.

00:45:59.134 --> 00:46:00.080
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.810
Thankfully, I can be prevented
with a plan-based diet.

00:46:03.810 --> 00:46:04.620
No, seriously.

00:46:04.620 --> 00:46:05.745
I said drugs actually.

00:46:05.745 --> 00:46:09.600
A study, 15,000 American
vegetarians, compared to them,

00:46:09.600 --> 00:46:11.100
meat eaters had
about twice the odds

00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:14.194
of being on aspirin; sleeping
pills; tranquilizers; antacids;

00:46:14.194 --> 00:46:16.360
pain killers; blood pressure
medications; laxatives,

00:46:16.360 --> 00:46:18.620
of course; as well as insulin.

00:46:18.620 --> 00:46:20.820
So plant-based diets
are great for people

00:46:20.820 --> 00:46:22.590
that don't like taking
drugs, for those

00:46:22.590 --> 00:46:24.490
that don't like
paying for drugs,

00:46:24.490 --> 00:46:28.650
and don't like risking
drug side effects.

00:46:28.650 --> 00:46:31.620
Want to solve the
health care crisis?

00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.410
I've got a suggestion.

00:46:33.410 --> 00:46:35.250
There's only one
diet that's ever

00:46:35.250 --> 00:46:38.450
been proven to
reverse heart disease

00:46:38.450 --> 00:46:42.050
in a majority of patients,
a plant-based diet.

00:46:42.050 --> 00:46:44.410
So any time anyone
want to sell you

00:46:44.410 --> 00:46:47.310
on some new diet they
heard about, do me a favor,

00:46:47.310 --> 00:46:48.677
ask them this simple question.

00:46:48.677 --> 00:46:49.260
Wait a second.

00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:52.790
Has it been proven to reverse
heart disease, the number one

00:46:52.790 --> 00:46:54.790
reason me and all my
loved ones have died?

00:46:54.790 --> 00:46:58.870
If the answer is no, then why
would you even consider it?

00:46:58.870 --> 00:47:02.630
I mean if that's all a
plant-based diet could do,

00:47:02.630 --> 00:47:07.400
reverse our number one
killer, shouldn't that

00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:10.634
be like the default diet
until proven otherwise.

00:47:10.634 --> 00:47:12.050
And the fact that
it also would be

00:47:12.050 --> 00:47:14.020
helpful in preventing,
arresting, and reversing

00:47:14.020 --> 00:47:16.600
other leading killers, like type
2 diabetes and hypertension,

00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.270
would seem to make
the case overwhelming.

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:24.460
Most deaths in the United States
are preventable and related

00:47:24.460 --> 00:47:25.926
to nutrition.

00:47:25.926 --> 00:47:27.550
According to the most
rigorous analysis

00:47:27.550 --> 00:47:29.780
of risk factors ever
published-- this is the Global

00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:32.279
Burden of Disease study funded
by the Bill and Melinda Gates

00:47:32.279 --> 00:47:33.657
Foundation-- the
number one cause

00:47:33.657 --> 00:47:35.740
of death in the United
States and number one cause

00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.710
of disability is our diet.

00:47:38.710 --> 00:47:42.642
And it has since bumped
tobacco smoking to number two.

00:47:42.642 --> 00:47:44.850
Smoking now only kills about
a half million Americans

00:47:44.850 --> 00:47:46.550
every year, whereas
our diet kills

00:47:46.550 --> 00:47:49.740
hundreds of thousands more.

00:47:49.740 --> 00:47:55.520
So let me end with a
thought experiment.

00:47:55.520 --> 00:48:02.160
Imagine yourself a
smoker back in the 1950s.

00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:05.810
The average per capita
consumption of cigarettes

00:48:05.810 --> 00:48:08.250
was about 4,000 a year.

00:48:08.250 --> 00:48:12.270
So the average American
smoked half a pack a day.

00:48:12.270 --> 00:48:14.810
Think about that.

00:48:14.810 --> 00:48:17.090
The media was
telling you to smoke.

00:48:17.090 --> 00:48:23.390
Famous athletes agreed, even
Santa Claus wanted you--

00:48:23.390 --> 00:48:30.012
I mean, look, you want to keep
fit and stay-- where are we--

00:48:30.012 --> 00:48:32.770
and stay slender.

00:48:32.770 --> 00:48:35.720
And so you make sure to smoke
and eat a lot of hot dogs

00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.920
to stay trim.

00:48:36.920 --> 00:48:40.120
And eat lots of the sugar
to stay slim and trim, a lot

00:48:40.120 --> 00:48:41.635
better than that apple there.

00:48:41.635 --> 00:48:42.260
I mean, sheesh.

00:48:45.460 --> 00:48:49.080
Though apples do connote
goodness and freshness,

00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:51.610
reads one internal
tobacco industry memo.

00:48:51.610 --> 00:48:53.110
Which brings up
many possibilities

00:48:53.110 --> 00:48:55.480
for making a
youth-oriented cigarette,

00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:57.360
like an apple-flavored
cigarette for kids.

00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:00.010
Ah, shameless.

00:49:00.010 --> 00:49:02.450
For digestion's sake, you smoke.

00:49:02.450 --> 00:49:05.060
I mean no curative power is
claimed by Philip Morris.

00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:07.650
But an ounce of prevention
is worth a pound of cure.

00:49:07.650 --> 00:49:13.330
So, hey, better safe
than sorry, and smoke.

00:49:13.330 --> 00:49:17.340
Blow in her face and
she'll follow you anywhere.

00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:22.100
No women ever says no.

00:49:22.100 --> 00:49:26.670
They're so round, so
firm, so fully packed.

00:49:26.670 --> 00:49:29.150
Now, after all, John
Wayne smoked them,

00:49:29.150 --> 00:49:31.530
until he got lung
cancer and died.

00:49:31.530 --> 00:49:35.790
Back then, even the
paleo folks were smoking.

00:49:35.790 --> 00:49:39.770
And so were the doctors.

00:49:39.770 --> 00:49:42.091
Now, this is not to say
there wasn't controversy

00:49:42.091 --> 00:49:43.340
within the medical profession.

00:49:43.340 --> 00:49:45.930
Sure, some doctors smoke Camels.

00:49:45.930 --> 00:49:48.340
But others preferred Luckies.

00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:50.830
So there was a little
disagreement there.

00:49:50.830 --> 00:49:53.140
The leader of the
US Senate agreed.

00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:58.080
I mean who wouldn't want to
give their throat a vacation?

00:49:58.080 --> 00:50:01.450
Not a single case of
throat irritation.

00:50:01.450 --> 00:50:07.792
Because, no surprise,
cigarettes are just as pure

00:50:07.792 --> 00:50:08.750
as the water you drink.

00:50:08.750 --> 00:50:10.930
And look, if you do get
irritated, no problem.

00:50:10.930 --> 00:50:15.350
Your doctor can write you a
prescription for cigarettes.

00:50:15.350 --> 00:50:18.060
This is an ad from the "Journal
of the American Medical

00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:19.850
Association."

00:50:19.850 --> 00:50:22.190
So when mainstream
medicine is saying

00:50:22.190 --> 00:50:26.660
that smoking may be, on balance,
beneficial-- when the American

00:50:26.660 --> 00:50:28.260
Medical Association
is saying that,

00:50:28.260 --> 00:50:31.670
where could you turn back then
if you just wanted the facts?

00:50:31.670 --> 00:50:35.210
What's the new data
advanced by science?

00:50:35.210 --> 00:50:40.480
She was too tired for fun
and then she smoked a Camel.

00:50:40.480 --> 00:50:43.810
Babe Ruth spoke of
proof-positive medical science.

00:50:43.810 --> 00:50:45.910
That is when he
still could speak,

00:50:45.910 --> 00:50:48.480
before he died of throat cancer.

00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:52.640
Now by some miracle, if there
was a smokingfacts.org website

00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:56.410
back then that could deliver
the science directly,

00:50:56.410 --> 00:50:58.770
bypassing commercially
corruptible

00:50:58.770 --> 00:51:01.650
institutional filters, you
would have become aware

00:51:01.650 --> 00:51:03.230
of studies like this.

00:51:03.230 --> 00:51:06.950
An event to study in
California in '58,

00:51:06.950 --> 00:51:09.800
1958, that showed that
nonsmokers are at least 90%

00:51:09.800 --> 00:51:12.100
less likely to die
of lung cancer.

00:51:12.100 --> 00:51:13.560
But this wasn't the first.

00:51:13.560 --> 00:51:15.460
When famed surgeon
Michael Debakey

00:51:15.460 --> 00:51:17.140
was asked why his
studies published back

00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:20.030
in the '30s, linking
smoking and lung cancer,

00:51:20.030 --> 00:51:22.340
were simply ignored,
he had to remind people

00:51:22.340 --> 00:51:24.170
what it was like back then.

00:51:24.170 --> 00:51:25.805
Smoking was everywhere.

00:51:25.805 --> 00:51:27.360
It was in the movies.

00:51:27.360 --> 00:51:30.410
Medical meetings were
one heavy haze of smoke.

00:51:30.410 --> 00:51:33.920
Smoking was normal.

00:51:33.920 --> 00:51:36.475
So back to our
thought experiment.

00:51:36.475 --> 00:51:40.820
If you're a smoker in the '50s,
in the know, what do you do?

00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.077
With access to the
science, you realize

00:51:43.077 --> 00:51:44.660
the best available
balance of evidence

00:51:44.660 --> 00:51:46.730
suggests your smoking
habit, not so good for you.

00:51:46.730 --> 00:51:49.270
So do you change or do you wait?

00:51:49.270 --> 00:51:51.470
If you wait until
your doctor tells

00:51:51.470 --> 00:51:55.840
you, between puffs, to quit,
you could have cancer by then.

00:51:55.840 --> 00:51:57.320
If you wait until
the powers that

00:51:57.320 --> 00:51:59.840
be officially recognize it,
like the Surgeon General did

00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:03.840
in the subsequent decade,
you could be dead by then.

00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:07.930
It took 25 years for the Surgeon
General report to come out.

00:52:07.930 --> 00:52:11.900
It took more than 7,000 studies.

00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:15.166
7,000 studies and the
deaths of countless smokers

00:52:15.166 --> 00:52:16.790
before the first
Surgeon General report

00:52:16.790 --> 00:52:18.340
was finally released
in the 1960s.

00:52:18.340 --> 00:52:20.840
You think maybe after
the first 6,000 studies,

00:52:20.840 --> 00:52:23.340
they could have given people a
little heads-up or something?

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.405
No, a powerful industry.

00:52:27.550 --> 00:52:29.920
So one wonders how many
people are currently

00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:32.330
suffering needlessly
from dietary diseases?

00:52:32.330 --> 00:52:33.880
Maybe we should
have stopped smoking

00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:38.420
after the 700th study like this.

00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:40.640
So as a smoker in the
'50s, on the one hand,

00:52:40.640 --> 00:52:43.160
you had all of society,
the government,

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.230
the medical profession
itself, telling you to smoke.

00:52:46.230 --> 00:52:49.560
And on the other
hand, all you had

00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:52.000
was the science,
if you were even

00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:55.060
lucky enough to know
about studies like this.

00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:58.040
Let's fast forward 55 years.

00:52:58.040 --> 00:53:00.500
There's a new Adventist study
out of California warning

00:53:00.500 --> 00:53:02.610
Americans about the risk
of something else they

00:53:02.610 --> 00:53:04.970
may be putting in their mouth.

00:53:04.970 --> 00:53:06.260
And it's not just one study.

00:53:06.260 --> 00:53:10.030
According to the latest review,
the total sum of evidence

00:53:10.030 --> 00:53:12.560
suggests mortality from all
causes put together, including

00:53:12.560 --> 00:53:15.150
many of our dreaded diseases,
stroke, cancer, et cetera,

00:53:15.150 --> 00:53:18.070
are significantly lower among
those eating plant-based.

00:53:18.070 --> 00:53:20.690
So instead of
someone going along

00:53:20.690 --> 00:53:24.420
with America's smoking habits
in the '50s, imagine you,

00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:26.020
or someone you care
about, going along

00:53:26.020 --> 00:53:30.460
with America's
dietary habits today.

00:53:30.460 --> 00:53:31.480
What do you do?

00:53:31.480 --> 00:53:33.406
I mean with access
to the science,

00:53:33.406 --> 00:53:35.680
you realize the best
available balance of evidence

00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:38.096
suggests that your eating
habits are not so great for you.

00:53:38.096 --> 00:53:40.020
So do you wait or do you choose?

00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:43.340
If you wait until your
doctor, between bites,

00:53:43.340 --> 00:53:47.130
tells you to change,
it may be too late.

00:53:47.130 --> 00:53:51.270
In fact, the AMA
actually went on record,

00:53:51.270 --> 00:53:55.240
refusing to endorse the
Surgeon General's report.

00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:57.880
Could it have been because
they just got a $10 million

00:53:57.880 --> 00:53:59.982
check from the tobacco industry?

00:53:59.982 --> 00:54:00.560
Hm.

00:54:00.560 --> 00:54:01.060
OK.

00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:03.910
So we know why the AMA was
sucking up to the tobacco

00:54:03.910 --> 00:54:04.810
industry back then.

00:54:04.810 --> 00:54:07.270
But why weren't individual
doctors speaking out?

00:54:07.270 --> 00:54:09.820
Well, there were a few gallant
souls ahead of their time

00:54:09.820 --> 00:54:14.910
speaking up, standing up against
industries killing millions.

00:54:14.910 --> 00:54:16.580
But why not more?

00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:21.450
Because maybe that's because
the majority of physicians

00:54:21.450 --> 00:54:23.500
themselves smoked
cigarettes, just

00:54:23.500 --> 00:54:26.230
like the majority
of physicians today

00:54:26.230 --> 00:54:28.710
continue to eat foods
that are contributing

00:54:28.710 --> 00:54:32.280
to our epidemic of
dietary diseases.

00:54:32.280 --> 00:54:34.700
What was the AMA's
rallying cry back then?

00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:38.150
Everything in moderation.

00:54:38.150 --> 00:54:40.010
Extensive scientific
studies had proven

00:54:40.010 --> 00:54:43.060
that smoking in
moderation is OK.

00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:45.090
Sound familiar?

00:54:45.090 --> 00:54:49.550
Today, the food industry uses
the same tobacco industry

00:54:49.550 --> 00:54:52.832
tactics, supply misinformation,
twisting the science.

00:54:52.832 --> 00:54:54.290
The same scientists
who were higher

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:57.080
paid to downplay the
risks of secondhand smoke

00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:00.960
and toxic chemicals, were the
same paid for by the National

00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:04.330
Confectioners Association to
downplay the risks of candy,

00:55:04.330 --> 00:55:06.890
and the same paid
by the meat industry

00:55:06.890 --> 00:55:09.360
to downplay the risks of meat.

00:55:09.360 --> 00:55:12.220
Consumption of animal
products and processed foods

00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:16.140
cause at least 14 million deaths
around the world every year,

00:55:16.140 --> 00:55:20.210
14 million people
dead every year.

00:55:20.210 --> 00:55:23.310
A plant-based diet
may now be considered

00:55:23.310 --> 00:55:27.716
perhaps the nutritional
equivalent of quitting smoking.

00:55:27.716 --> 00:55:29.340
How many more people
have to die though

00:55:29.340 --> 00:55:31.440
before the CDC
encourages people not

00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.920
to wait for open heart surgery,
to start eating healthy

00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.670
as well?

00:55:36.670 --> 00:55:39.790
Until the system
changes, we have

00:55:39.790 --> 00:55:42.450
to take personal
responsibility for our health,

00:55:42.450 --> 00:55:43.450
for our family's health.

00:55:43.450 --> 00:55:47.260
We can't wait until society
catches up to the science

00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:51.260
because it's a matter
of life and death.

00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.210
Dr. Kim Williams
became the president

00:55:53.210 --> 00:55:55.750
of the American College
of Cardiology last year.

00:55:55.750 --> 00:55:57.582
He was asked why he
follows his own advice,

00:55:57.582 --> 00:55:58.790
to follow a plant-based diet.

00:55:58.790 --> 00:56:00.540
He said, I don't mind dying.

00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:04.060
Dr. Williams replied,
I just don't want it

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:08.576
to be my own fault. Thank you.

00:56:08.576 --> 00:56:10.504
[APPLAUSE]

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:17.040
For any of you who would like
to share this talk with anyone,

00:56:17.040 --> 00:56:20.310
I've got free copies
of all my DVDs.

00:56:20.310 --> 00:56:23.692
So this is from "Uprooting
the Leading Cause of Death."

00:56:23.692 --> 00:56:25.275
So please feel free
to come take them.

00:56:25.275 --> 00:56:26.970
I also have-- I'll
go through the list--

00:56:26.970 --> 00:56:29.511
the most disabling disease, the
most common disease, the most

00:56:29.511 --> 00:56:31.760
dreaded disease, and not
just the ones that kill us,

00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:34.670
along with lots of other DVDs.

00:56:34.670 --> 00:56:38.885
And I'm so happy to have my new
book here, "How Not to Die,"

00:56:38.885 --> 00:56:40.760
three weeks on the New
York Best Seller List.

00:56:40.760 --> 00:56:41.500
I'm very excited.

00:56:41.500 --> 00:56:43.260
And all proceeds from
the sale of my books,

00:56:43.260 --> 00:56:45.635
and my speaking engagements,
and DVDs, and my whole life,

00:56:45.635 --> 00:56:47.090
all goes to charity of course.

00:56:47.090 --> 00:56:52.040
And all my work is available
free on NutritionFacts.org.

00:56:52.040 --> 00:56:55.122
I'm happy to take any
questions, sign books, anything.

00:56:57.720 --> 00:56:59.144
Yes?

00:56:59.144 --> 00:57:00.088
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:57:00.088 --> 00:57:02.448
Have there been any
rigorous looking

00:57:02.448 --> 00:57:09.620
at why let's say animal
protein is causing things

00:57:09.620 --> 00:57:12.100
like inflammation
and cascade breaks.

00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:16.062
Because I'm interest in we have
this spectrum of the McDonald's

00:57:16.062 --> 00:57:24.940
hamburger versus perhaps the
Joel Salatin pasture-raised,

00:57:24.940 --> 00:57:27.970
grass-fed beef.

00:57:27.970 --> 00:57:32.136
And we know that a lot
of animal feed is crap.

00:57:32.136 --> 00:57:34.357
And it contains
RoundUp and whatever.

00:57:34.357 --> 00:57:35.232
MICHAEL GREGER: Yeah.

00:57:35.232 --> 00:57:35.450
Yeah.

00:57:35.450 --> 00:57:35.950
Yeah.

00:57:35.950 --> 00:57:37.009
Great question.

00:57:37.009 --> 00:57:38.592
AUDIENCE: Do you
have a sense of that?

00:57:38.592 --> 00:57:45.954
And like is there a possibility
that if one kept eating

00:57:45.954 --> 00:57:49.455
animal-based food,
but did it with--

00:57:49.455 --> 00:57:50.330
MICHAEL GREGER: Sure.

00:57:50.330 --> 00:57:51.141
Grass-fed, organic.

00:57:51.141 --> 00:57:51.640
Yes.

00:57:51.640 --> 00:57:51.950
Sure.

00:57:51.950 --> 00:57:52.030
Absolute.

00:57:52.030 --> 00:57:53.613
AUDIENCE: --exactly,
that we might see

00:57:53.613 --> 00:57:55.000
lower levels of inflammation?

00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:57.250
MICHAEL GREGER: So
for the inflammation,

00:57:57.250 --> 00:57:59.540
the current theory is
that an endotoxin effect.

00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:03.800
So endotoxins are the components
of bacterial cell walls

00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:06.000
essentially, that aren't
destroyed by cooking,

00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:08.790
not destroyed by stomach acid,
proteolytic enyzmes in the gut.

00:58:08.790 --> 00:58:10.140
So it doesn't matter
how much you cook it.

00:58:10.140 --> 00:58:11.515
But then you just
have these kind

00:58:11.515 --> 00:58:13.850
of fragments, bacterial
cell wall fragments, that

00:58:13.850 --> 00:58:15.220
get absorbed into the system.

00:58:15.220 --> 00:58:16.970
Actually, fat helps
kind of transmit it

00:58:16.970 --> 00:58:19.486
through the gut wall, so we
get what's called endotoxemia.

00:58:19.486 --> 00:58:21.110
You get endotoxins
in our blood stream.

00:58:21.110 --> 00:58:22.230
And we've evolved
for millions of years

00:58:22.230 --> 00:58:23.860
and think, ah, bacteria
in our bloodstream, that's

00:58:23.860 --> 00:58:24.390
a bad thing.

00:58:24.390 --> 00:58:26.348
So we get the spike of
inflammation two, three,

00:58:26.348 --> 00:58:27.860
four hours right after the meal.

00:58:27.860 --> 00:58:29.620
And then that calms right down.

00:58:29.620 --> 00:58:32.225
Because you can
see such dramatic

00:58:32.225 --> 00:58:34.160
a short-term acute
effects, then we

00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:35.900
can put different
meats to the test.

00:58:35.900 --> 00:58:36.820
And that work is done.

00:58:36.820 --> 00:58:39.360
So a study that was
done, actually Australia.

00:58:39.360 --> 00:58:43.070
So they chose wild-caught meat,
which there is kangaroo meat.

00:58:43.070 --> 00:58:45.700
It's like their
venison basically.

00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:46.794
And they compared that.

00:58:46.794 --> 00:58:49.210
They compared the spike of
inflammation from kangaroo meat

00:58:49.210 --> 00:58:53.120
to retail meat bought off
the supermarket shelves.

00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:54.760
And they found that
the kangaroo meat

00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:57.600
causes significantly
less inflammation

00:58:57.600 --> 00:58:59.160
than the retail meat.

00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:04.320
Though one could argue that why
have any inflammation at all,

00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:06.840
where eating plants foods
and your antioxidant response

00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:10.530
foods, it can
anti-inflammatory actually.

00:59:10.530 --> 00:59:12.900
And so, yes, less inflammation.

00:59:12.900 --> 00:59:15.320
So definitely a step
in the right direction.

00:59:15.320 --> 00:59:19.080
Probably the greatest benefits
to kind of the organic meat

00:59:19.080 --> 00:59:21.715
movement is that it makes
it really expensive.

00:59:21.715 --> 00:59:22.450
[LAUGHTER]

00:59:22.450 --> 00:59:23.520
And so-- no.

00:59:23.520 --> 00:59:24.767
So people eat less.

00:59:24.767 --> 00:59:26.600
And that's really the
recommendation, right?

00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:29.070
Reduce meat consumption,
meatless Mondays obviously.

00:59:29.070 --> 00:59:31.570
So if people really want to go
to restaurants that have that

00:59:31.570 --> 00:59:35.290
or really only
buy-- then it's more

00:59:35.290 --> 00:59:37.550
like a condiment or a
flavoring to a dish,

00:59:37.550 --> 00:59:39.650
as opposed to a big hunk.

00:59:39.650 --> 00:59:42.310
And so I would not be
surprised, if you studied

00:59:42.310 --> 00:59:45.357
a cohort of people, people
that really did eat that way,

00:59:45.357 --> 00:59:46.690
would have significantly better.

00:59:46.690 --> 00:59:49.602
But it may be more tied
to the quantity of meat

00:59:49.602 --> 00:59:52.060
that they'd be eating because
they're eating higher quality

00:59:52.060 --> 00:59:54.825
meat than actually
the meat itself.

00:59:54.825 --> 00:59:56.700
There's still the
saturated fat and all that.

00:59:56.700 --> 00:59:58.034
Yeah.

00:59:58.034 --> 00:59:58.534
Yeah?

00:59:58.534 --> 01:00:00.430
AUDIENCE: I have two
questions actually.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:01.388
MICHAEL GREGER: Please.

01:00:01.388 --> 01:00:04.668
AUDIENCE: The first one is
there a way to be a vegetarian

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:09.285
in a wrong way, like maybe
you're-- let's say you forget

01:00:09.285 --> 01:00:13.505
to-- you don't eat enough
protein or you don't get--

01:00:13.505 --> 01:00:14.380
MICHAEL GREGER: Yeah.

01:00:14.380 --> 01:00:14.670
Yeah.

01:00:14.670 --> 01:00:15.120
Yeah.

01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:15.220
Yeah.

01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:15.390
Yeah.

01:00:15.390 --> 01:00:15.890
Yeah.

01:00:15.890 --> 01:00:16.770
Thank you.

01:00:16.770 --> 01:00:16.890
Yeah.

01:00:16.890 --> 01:00:18.223
No, thank you for that question.

01:00:18.223 --> 01:00:21.139
You know, a couple decades ago,
if you were a vegetarian, then

01:00:21.139 --> 01:00:22.680
by definition you
had to eat healthy.

01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.510
Like you'd go to the
supermarkets, like the produce

01:00:24.510 --> 01:00:25.760
aisle, what do you got to eat.

01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.240
But now, there's
vegan junk food.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:31.210
There's a product called
vegan bacon grease.

01:00:31.210 --> 01:00:33.050
There's like you can
get vegan ice cream.

01:00:33.050 --> 01:00:34.750
You can get vegan crispy.

01:00:34.750 --> 01:00:36.730
The best doughnut
in New York City

01:00:36.730 --> 01:00:40.975
was some Brooklyn
vegan donut shop.

01:00:40.975 --> 01:00:42.280
Yeah, done well doughnuts.

01:00:42.280 --> 01:00:43.650
OK.

01:00:43.650 --> 01:00:46.440
So it's like the
gluten-free people.

01:00:46.440 --> 01:00:48.474
If you had celiac disease
a couple decades ago,

01:00:48.474 --> 01:00:50.890
you had to eat healthy because
you couldn't eat junk food.

01:00:50.890 --> 01:00:52.280
Now, you can get
gluten-free junk food.

01:00:52.280 --> 01:00:53.780
You can get vegan
gluten-free junk food.

01:00:53.780 --> 01:00:54.280
Yeah.

01:00:54.280 --> 01:00:56.600
OK.

01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.240
In fact, the unhealthiest
thing you can find in the store

01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.219
actually has vegetable
in the title.

01:01:01.219 --> 01:01:03.510
It's partially hydrogenated
vegetable oil, like Crisco,

01:01:03.510 --> 01:01:04.340
like shortening.

01:01:04.340 --> 01:01:05.790
That's the worst
thing, transfats.

01:01:05.790 --> 01:01:07.081
It's worse than saturated fats.

01:01:07.081 --> 01:01:08.670
It's worse than processed meat.

01:01:08.670 --> 01:01:11.210
It's the worst thing
we can possibly eat.

01:01:11.210 --> 01:01:12.440
Its plant based technically.

01:01:12.440 --> 01:01:12.940
All right.

01:01:12.940 --> 01:01:16.075
So that's why I don't like
the term vegan, vegetarian.

01:01:16.075 --> 01:01:18.964
Because that tells me as a
physician what you don't eat.

01:01:18.964 --> 01:01:20.380
That doesn't tell
what you do eat.

01:01:20.380 --> 01:01:22.180
But that's why if
you tell me, well,

01:01:22.180 --> 01:01:24.430
I eat a whole food plant-based.

01:01:24.430 --> 01:01:24.930
OK.

01:01:24.930 --> 01:01:25.380
You tell me.

01:01:25.380 --> 01:01:25.690
OK.

01:01:25.690 --> 01:01:26.600
You're eating-- OK.

01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:28.190
But you can still screw that up.

01:01:28.190 --> 01:01:29.600
And how do you screw that up?

01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:32.590
By not ensuring a regular
reliable source of vitamin

01:01:32.590 --> 01:01:33.369
B-12.

01:01:33.369 --> 01:01:35.410
There's two vitamins that
are not made by plants.

01:01:35.410 --> 01:01:37.750
One is vitamin D, which
is made by animals,

01:01:37.750 --> 01:01:41.564
such as yourself, when you walk
outside and get some sunshine.

01:01:41.564 --> 01:01:42.730
It's actually not a vitamin.

01:01:42.730 --> 01:01:44.690
It's a hormone created by Sun.

01:01:44.690 --> 01:01:47.270
But no matter how
long you sunbathe

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:50.610
naked in Times Square
on New Year's Day,

01:01:50.610 --> 01:01:52.850
the Sun's rays are at such
an angle at this latitude

01:01:52.850 --> 01:01:53.820
during the winter
months, you're not

01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:56.440
going to make any vitamin D.
January, February no vitamin D

01:01:56.440 --> 01:01:57.857
production in New York City.

01:01:57.857 --> 01:01:59.440
I mean they actually
did these studies

01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.110
using human foreskins
on the tops of buildings

01:02:02.110 --> 01:02:03.211
here in New York City.

01:02:03.211 --> 01:02:03.960
Because they were.

01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:05.220
You need human skin.

01:02:05.220 --> 01:02:06.410
Well, anyway.

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:06.910
[LAUGHTER]

01:02:06.910 --> 01:02:08.782
No vitamin D
production whatsoever.

01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:17.010
So you need to get
vitamin D, depending

01:02:17.010 --> 01:02:19.230
on where you-- I mean we
evolved running around

01:02:19.230 --> 01:02:20.760
naked in equatorial
Africa, getting

01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:21.912
baked in the Sun all day.

01:02:21.912 --> 01:02:23.620
We're not used to
living at this latitude

01:02:23.620 --> 01:02:24.786
and wearing lots of clothes.

01:02:24.786 --> 01:02:25.540
OK.

01:02:25.540 --> 01:02:28.370
And vitamin B-12 is not
made by plants either,

01:02:28.370 --> 01:02:29.240
not made by animals.

01:02:29.240 --> 01:02:31.406
It's made by little microbes
that blanket the Earth.

01:02:31.406 --> 01:02:33.550
So we get all the B-12
we need drinking out

01:02:33.550 --> 01:02:35.170
of a mountain stream or
well water, or something.

01:02:35.170 --> 01:02:36.820
But now, we chlorinate
our water supply

01:02:36.820 --> 01:02:38.080
to kill off any bacteria.

01:02:38.080 --> 01:02:40.330
We just don't get a lot of
B-12 in our water any more.

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:41.980
Don't get a lot
of cholera either.

01:02:41.980 --> 01:02:44.450
It's very good thing.

01:02:44.450 --> 01:02:47.280
But now, because we live in
such a sanitary situation.

01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:49.350
So our fellow
great apes get B-12

01:02:49.350 --> 01:02:51.130
from bugs, dirt, and feces.

01:02:51.130 --> 01:02:52.080
But, let's see.

01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:54.810
I prefer supplemental sources.

01:02:54.810 --> 01:02:56.820
So I recommend a
vitamin B-12 supplement

01:02:56.820 --> 01:03:00.260
people eating a plant-based
diet, one 2,500 microgram

01:03:00.260 --> 01:03:02.870
tablet once a week, costs
less than $3 a year,

01:03:02.870 --> 01:03:04.280
all the B-12 you need.

01:03:04.280 --> 01:03:05.780
There's also B-12
fortified foods,

01:03:05.780 --> 01:03:07.500
like there's soy milk,
and breakfast cereal,

01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.375
and things like that.

01:03:08.375 --> 01:03:11.400
But I encourage people to eat
less of those processed foods.

01:03:11.400 --> 01:03:13.670
So probably the safest,
cheapest way is just get it.

01:03:13.670 --> 01:03:15.170
But I'm so glad you
brought that up.

01:03:15.170 --> 01:03:17.370
Because that's critical.

01:03:17.370 --> 01:03:19.430
B-12 is critical for
neurological health

01:03:19.430 --> 01:03:20.650
and for blood health.

01:03:20.650 --> 01:03:21.904
AUDIENCE: What about omega-3?

01:03:21.904 --> 01:03:22.570
Is that a thing?

01:03:22.570 --> 01:03:23.950
MICHAEL GREGER: Oh, yeah.

01:03:23.950 --> 01:03:26.744
So there are essential fatty
acids-- omega-6 and omega-3

01:03:26.744 --> 01:03:27.660
essential fatty acids.

01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.243
Meaning that our
body can't make them.

01:03:29.243 --> 01:03:31.360
We need to take
them into our diet.

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.070
And so the current
recommendations

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:39.520
we need to get basically
about two grams of omega-3s.

01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:42.800
And so you can get that
in alpha-linolenic acid,

01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.610
like a tablespoon
of ground flaxseeds,

01:03:44.610 --> 01:03:46.620
all the omega-3s you'd
take for the day.

01:03:46.620 --> 01:03:48.487
So that's part of
my daily dozen foods

01:03:48.487 --> 01:03:50.570
I encourage people to eat
every day in their diet.

01:03:50.570 --> 01:03:52.200
Is that one of a
tablespoon of flaxseeds.

01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:52.700
Why?

01:03:52.700 --> 01:03:54.060
You need to get your omega-3s.

01:03:54.060 --> 01:03:56.290
Or you can also eat walnuts,
or dark-green leafy vegetables,

01:03:56.290 --> 01:03:57.960
or chia seeds, hemp
seeds, lots of things.

01:03:57.960 --> 01:03:59.668
But you need to get
those into your diet.

01:04:02.497 --> 01:04:04.580
And our bodies can take
those short-chain omega-3s

01:04:04.580 --> 01:04:07.020
and elongate them into
the so-called fish fats,

01:04:07.020 --> 01:04:08.390
like EPA and DHA.

01:04:08.390 --> 01:04:12.620
The question though is can we
do it enough for optimal health?

01:04:12.620 --> 01:04:15.450
And that I think still
remains an open question.

01:04:15.450 --> 01:04:19.550
So I actually encourage
people to take 250 milligrams

01:04:19.550 --> 01:04:23.210
of a pollutant-free, a source
of long-chain omega-3s, EPA

01:04:23.210 --> 01:04:24.327
or DHA.

01:04:24.327 --> 01:04:26.160
And the only way you
can do that gluten-free

01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:29.710
is either yeast-based or
algae-based EPA or DHA.

01:04:29.710 --> 01:04:32.210
That's actually where the fish
get it, from the first place.

01:04:32.210 --> 01:04:33.793
We can kind of cut
out the middle fish

01:04:33.793 --> 01:04:37.150
and go straight to the source.

01:04:37.150 --> 01:04:38.760
And not for heart
health, actually.

01:04:38.760 --> 01:04:40.630
Because the studies
have shown we now

01:04:40.630 --> 01:04:43.595
know that recommendations to
increase fatty fish consumption

01:04:43.595 --> 01:04:45.220
and take fish oil
capsules don't appear

01:04:45.220 --> 01:04:49.130
to help prevent heart disease
or help treat heart disease--

01:04:49.130 --> 01:04:51.930
but for cognitive health.

01:04:51.930 --> 01:04:57.430
There's this study linking kind
of accelerated cerebral volume

01:04:57.430 --> 01:05:02.651
loss with low
omega-3 index, which

01:05:02.651 --> 01:05:03.900
are these long-chain omega-3s.

01:05:03.900 --> 01:05:07.960
So I encourage people to
include that, absolutely.

01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:09.070
Great, a good question.

01:05:09.070 --> 01:05:10.387
Thank you.

01:05:10.387 --> 01:05:12.178
AUDIENCE: So you talk
a lot about nutrition

01:05:12.178 --> 01:05:14.906
with like a normal
level of exercise,

01:05:14.906 --> 01:05:19.370
a moderate, healthy amount
of 30 to 60 minutes.

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:21.354
How does the
situation change when

01:05:21.354 --> 01:05:24.330
you're talking more vigorous
exercise for athletes and such?

01:05:24.330 --> 01:05:26.810
In particular, concerning
any [INAUDIBLE],

01:05:26.810 --> 01:05:29.100
but one thing comes to
mind is higher protein.

01:05:29.100 --> 01:05:29.430
MICHAEL GREGER: Sure.

01:05:29.430 --> 01:05:29.930
Sure.

01:05:29.930 --> 01:05:30.930
AUDIENCE: --for
like long distance.

01:05:30.930 --> 01:05:31.110
MICHAEL GREGER: Yeah.

01:05:31.110 --> 01:05:31.250
No.

01:05:31.250 --> 01:05:31.410
No.

01:05:31.410 --> 01:05:31.910
Absolutely.

01:05:31.910 --> 01:05:33.900
And so they actually
take care of themselves

01:05:33.900 --> 01:05:36.990
because we eat so
many more calories.

01:05:36.990 --> 01:05:38.616
I mean so you're just
eating more food.

01:05:38.616 --> 01:05:41.156
So if you stick to to healthy
foods, you can do all the math.

01:05:41.156 --> 01:05:43.715
You can see that you're going
to get kind of all the iron you

01:05:43.715 --> 01:05:45.006
need, all the protein you need.

01:05:45.006 --> 01:05:47.200
We actually get about 70%
more protein than we need,

01:05:47.200 --> 01:05:51.160
even people that are sedentary.

01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:51.660
But, right.

01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:54.100
So you absolutely have
increased calorie needs.

01:05:54.100 --> 01:05:58.240
The only time you
really run into problems

01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:05.092
is athletes who are trying
to calorie restrict.

01:06:05.092 --> 01:06:07.050
Who are actually trying
to kind of lose weight,

01:06:07.050 --> 01:06:08.240
preserve lean body mass.

01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:09.990
And if you're not
eating enough calories--

01:06:09.990 --> 01:06:12.414
so they go on these
like starvation diets--

01:06:12.414 --> 01:06:14.080
and so if you're not
eating enough food,

01:06:14.080 --> 01:06:16.310
then you really have to
be careful to make sure

01:06:16.310 --> 01:06:18.100
that food really
packs a nutritional

01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.310
punch so you're getting the most
kind of nutrient dense foods.

01:06:21.310 --> 01:06:24.950
So if you just lived off of
iceberg lettuce and cotton

01:06:24.950 --> 01:06:26.120
candy or something.

01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.230
But even healthy-- I mean you
could run into some problems.

01:06:30.230 --> 01:06:34.536
But people eating enough food,
it shouldn't be a problem.

01:06:34.536 --> 01:06:37.960
AUDIENCE: Should we avoid
potatoes, bread, rice,

01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:38.951
and pasta?

01:06:38.951 --> 01:06:40.450
MICHAEL GREGER: So
it's interesting.

01:06:44.569 --> 01:06:47.110
The bottom line is I encourage
people to stick to whole foods

01:06:47.110 --> 01:06:48.260
whenever possible.

01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:49.290
So pasta is fine.

01:06:49.290 --> 01:06:52.390
But I'd like people to
have whole grain pasta.

01:06:52.390 --> 01:06:53.930
And actually sweet
potatoes, I think

01:06:53.930 --> 01:06:55.346
are healthier than
white potatoes.

01:06:55.346 --> 01:06:58.230
And I give my kind
of reasons why.

01:06:58.230 --> 01:07:02.850
And in general, flour products,
even when they're whole wheat,

01:07:02.850 --> 01:07:03.810
are not great.

01:07:03.810 --> 01:07:08.200
Because you actually you
starve your microbial self.

01:07:10.775 --> 01:07:13.150
So they do these really neat
studies where they basically

01:07:13.150 --> 01:07:14.620
give people the same diet.

01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:16.820
But they grind up
everything beforehand.

01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:19.680
So instead of beans, they
give some people chick peas,

01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:20.550
some people humus.

01:07:20.550 --> 01:07:23.430
They give some people bread
and some people like actually

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.650
wheat berries.

01:07:24.650 --> 01:07:25.880
And you do that for grains.

01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:28.800
And you chop up your oatmeal
or steel-cut oatmeal.

01:07:28.800 --> 01:07:33.330
And you can dramatically boost
the weight of their stool.

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:35.790
And actually most of
the weight of a stool

01:07:35.790 --> 01:07:37.150
is actually pure bacteria.

01:07:37.150 --> 01:07:40.160
It's just trillions and
trillions of bacteria.

01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:42.860
There's so much food
because little pieces

01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:44.310
of starch-- and
starch, no matter

01:07:44.310 --> 01:07:46.586
how well you chew,
actually get down or past

01:07:46.586 --> 01:07:48.460
our small intestine into
our lower intestine.

01:07:48.460 --> 01:07:50.834
And these are the prebiotics,
the fiber-resistant starch.

01:07:50.834 --> 01:07:53.300
The prebiotics that feed our
good gut bacteria, so much

01:07:53.300 --> 01:07:56.490
so that they go
crazy when you eat

01:07:56.490 --> 01:08:00.620
kind of whole intact grains,
not just whole grains.

01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:03.220
So whole intact grains are
preferable because then we

01:08:03.220 --> 01:08:04.630
leave some for our gut bacteria.

01:08:04.630 --> 01:08:06.755
And we're learning more
and more about the benefits

01:08:06.755 --> 01:08:07.780
of the microbiome.

01:08:07.780 --> 01:08:11.940
Whereas when you process foods
into flour or grind them up,

01:08:11.940 --> 01:08:15.610
they become so efficiently
absorbed that other

01:08:15.610 --> 01:08:17.979
than the fiber, you're
not leaving anything.

01:08:17.979 --> 01:08:18.920
And we feed them.

01:08:18.920 --> 01:08:19.560
They feed us.

01:08:19.560 --> 01:08:22.670
There's really some cool stuff
out there about the microbiome.

01:08:22.670 --> 01:08:23.670
Yes?

01:08:23.670 --> 01:08:29.859
AUDIENCE: So if you reverse
amortize the effects of like,

01:08:29.859 --> 01:08:32.323
say, eating bacon over
the course of your life,

01:08:32.323 --> 01:08:35.200
you can something like
every strip of bacon

01:08:35.200 --> 01:08:37.672
takes 17 minutes off
the end of your life.

01:08:37.672 --> 01:08:39.547
And you can say
this someone, it's

01:08:39.547 --> 01:08:41.630
just kind of chilling the
impact of their choices.

01:08:41.630 --> 01:08:44.239
And they'll say, well,
yeah, but that's just

01:08:44.239 --> 01:08:46.486
the time at the end.

01:08:46.486 --> 01:08:48.755
So I was wondering if you
had a response to that?

01:08:48.755 --> 01:08:49.630
MICHAEL GREGER: Yeah.

01:08:49.630 --> 01:08:50.010
No.

01:08:50.010 --> 01:08:51.970
Well, I mean that brings
up an important point.

01:08:51.970 --> 01:08:55.540
So we're actually
living longer lives,

01:08:55.540 --> 01:08:58.149
but shorter healthy lifespans.

01:08:58.149 --> 01:09:00.420
So we actually live
like a year longer

01:09:00.420 --> 01:09:01.510
than we did 20 years ago.

01:09:01.510 --> 01:09:03.010
But we're actually
two years shorter

01:09:03.010 --> 01:09:05.670
in terms of healthy lifespan,
without a major disabling

01:09:05.670 --> 01:09:07.240
disease, like the
ability to stand

01:09:07.240 --> 01:09:09.140
for a certain number of minutes
without having to sit down

01:09:09.140 --> 01:09:10.014
and things like that.

01:09:10.014 --> 01:09:13.510
These kind of severe disability.

01:09:13.510 --> 01:09:16.390
And so it's not just about
adding years to your life.

01:09:16.390 --> 01:09:18.620
It's adding life to your years.

01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:22.445
So we want to be
skydiving until the end.

01:09:26.210 --> 01:09:30.220
So that's why I have this
talk about the most disabling

01:09:30.220 --> 01:09:31.160
diseases too.

01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:33.214
So, yeah, if you're
crippled with arthritis

01:09:33.214 --> 01:09:35.130
maybe you don't want to
live an extra 10 years

01:09:35.130 --> 01:09:36.420
because you can't even move.

01:09:36.420 --> 01:09:37.790
Absolutely.

01:09:37.790 --> 01:09:40.860
And I mean spoiler alert,
it's the same healthy diet

01:09:40.860 --> 01:09:44.120
that-- yeah, yeah, yeah.

01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.350
And so, right.

01:09:45.350 --> 01:09:47.479
So they have all
these neat metrics,

01:09:47.479 --> 01:09:48.986
like disability-adjusted
life years.

01:09:48.986 --> 01:09:50.819
So they're not just how
many years you have,

01:09:50.819 --> 01:09:52.529
but how many healthy years.

01:09:52.529 --> 01:09:54.109
And you get the
same kind of stats.

01:09:54.109 --> 01:09:56.400
In fact, that's what the
Global Burden of Disease study

01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.831
looked at daily-- looked at
those disability-adjusted life

01:09:58.831 --> 01:09:59.330
years.

01:09:59.330 --> 01:10:01.960
So it's not just-- it's we're
extending healthy lifespan.

01:10:01.960 --> 01:10:03.370
That's really a critical key.

01:10:03.370 --> 01:10:04.380
Yeah, good point.

01:10:04.380 --> 01:10:05.880
Yeah, yeah.

01:10:05.880 --> 01:10:07.630
AUDIENCE: I've read
some things recently

01:10:07.630 --> 01:10:09.378
regarding the
benefits of alcohol.

01:10:09.378 --> 01:10:11.370
And then read things
saying the opposite.

01:10:11.370 --> 01:10:13.700
How does this play into it?

01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:14.575
MICHAEL GREGER: Yeah.

01:10:14.575 --> 01:10:14.840
Yeah.

01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:17.050
So alcohol consumption decreases
the risk of the number one

01:10:17.050 --> 01:10:17.966
killer, heart disease.

01:10:17.966 --> 01:10:20.724
Increases the risk of one type
of stroke, hemorrhagic stoke;

01:10:20.724 --> 01:10:22.140
decreases the risk
of another type

01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:24.070
of stroke, ischemic stroke;
increases the risk of cancer.

01:10:24.070 --> 01:10:25.690
And so you could
see how we could

01:10:25.690 --> 01:10:27.100
be flopping back and forth.

01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:31.505
The bottom line is
these are people eating

01:10:31.505 --> 01:10:32.739
the standard American diet.

01:10:32.739 --> 01:10:34.780
And the people eating the
standard American diet,

01:10:34.780 --> 01:10:37.350
adding alcohol to
their diet actually

01:10:37.350 --> 01:10:39.850
does extend lifespan because
heart disease is killer number

01:10:39.850 --> 01:10:40.350
one.

01:10:40.350 --> 01:10:43.790
But people who even have a
modicum of healthy behaviors--

01:10:43.790 --> 01:10:48.160
and by healthy behaviors, they
said ate fruit or a vegetable

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.670
serving a day.

01:10:49.670 --> 01:10:50.170
"Or," right.

01:10:53.160 --> 01:10:54.750
Not currently
smoking, it means you

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:55.930
could have a lot of
smoking in the past,

01:10:55.930 --> 01:10:57.014
but not currently smoking.

01:10:57.014 --> 01:10:58.179
I forget about the exercise.

01:10:58.179 --> 01:11:00.510
It was like 20 minutes
walking every day or something

01:11:00.510 --> 01:11:02.430
like that.

01:11:02.430 --> 01:11:08.000
If you fit those criteria, then
the alcohol has no benefit.

01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.500
But it thins your blood enough
that when your arteries are so

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:14.990
clogged up, it can
actually extend lifespan.

01:11:14.990 --> 01:11:17.990
And unfortunately,
even light drinking

01:11:17.990 --> 01:11:19.590
increased risk of breast cancer.

01:11:19.590 --> 01:11:22.500
So the big Harvard Nurse's
study looked at women even

01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:26.400
drinking less than a drink
a day, one drink a day,

01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:29.680
had significant increased
risk of breast cancer.

01:11:29.680 --> 01:11:31.840
So, in general, I
encourage people

01:11:31.840 --> 01:11:35.080
to stay away from alcohol.

01:11:38.002 --> 01:11:42.485
AUDIENCE: If you've heard of
Soylent and MealSquares, what

01:11:42.485 --> 01:11:43.980
are your [INAUDIBLE]?

01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:44.855
MICHAEL GREGER: Yeah.

01:11:44.855 --> 01:11:50.900
So it's like if you like pick
up a package of mushrooms

01:11:50.900 --> 01:11:52.170
in the store, you look at it.

01:11:52.170 --> 01:11:53.550
You turn it around and look
at the nutrition factors.

01:11:53.550 --> 01:11:54.980
It's like there's
nothing in there.

01:11:54.980 --> 01:11:56.560
A couple B vitamins,
maybe a few minerals.

01:11:56.560 --> 01:11:57.290
But you're like,
eh, there's nothing.

01:11:57.290 --> 01:11:59.250
You put it back on the shelf.

01:11:59.250 --> 01:12:02.820
And that's because they're
listing the top seven or so

01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:03.800
vitamins and minerals.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.100
What they're missing out
are the phytonutrients,

01:12:05.100 --> 01:12:07.070
so in that case,
the micronutrients.

01:12:07.070 --> 01:12:09.740
There's literally
tens of thousands

01:12:09.740 --> 01:12:11.680
of these phytonutrients,
some of which

01:12:11.680 --> 01:12:15.080
we think could be maybe
the reason why we see some

01:12:15.080 --> 01:12:16.340
of these beneficial things.

01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:19.810
And so you can hit all
the RDAs, but miss out

01:12:19.810 --> 01:12:22.450
on all the phytonutrients,
the tens of thousands

01:12:22.450 --> 01:12:26.390
of phytonutrients, where
there's the carotenoids,

01:12:26.390 --> 01:12:28.795
like beta carotene, and
lycopene, and [INAUDIBLE],

01:12:28.795 --> 01:12:30.670
which is associated with
eye health and brain

01:12:30.670 --> 01:12:32.790
health and all these things.

01:12:32.790 --> 01:12:36.060
It's difficult to capture
it in a whole food.

01:12:36.060 --> 01:12:38.280
And there's been some real
kind of cautionary tales.

01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:41.460
So, for example, the
beta carotene debacle,

01:12:41.460 --> 01:12:43.830
where researchers
noticed that people

01:12:43.830 --> 01:12:46.790
who had high beta carotene
levels lived longer,

01:12:46.790 --> 01:12:48.150
had less disease.

01:12:48.150 --> 01:12:50.270
I mean it's a great
indicator of health,

01:12:50.270 --> 01:12:52.436
how much beta carotene you
have in your bloodstream.

01:12:52.436 --> 01:12:54.667
Like if I wanted to
place bets on somebody,

01:12:54.667 --> 01:12:56.500
I'd want to know their
beta carotene levels.

01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:57.210
OK.

01:12:57.210 --> 01:12:59.660
And so they said,
aha, let's give people

01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:01.830
beta carotene pills.

01:13:01.830 --> 01:13:04.247
And so they took people at
high risk for cancer, smokers--

01:13:04.247 --> 01:13:06.746
because then we don't have to
have a short study because you

01:13:06.746 --> 01:13:09.830
get so much cancer-- split them
up in two groups, beta carotene

01:13:09.830 --> 01:13:10.970
pills and placebo.

01:13:10.970 --> 01:13:14.810
And the beta carotene
group got more cancer.

01:13:14.810 --> 01:13:16.130
They had to stop the study.

01:13:16.130 --> 01:13:16.630
OK.

01:13:16.630 --> 01:13:17.400
OK.

01:13:17.400 --> 01:13:19.240
And then they went back and
said, well, wait a second.

01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.489
Why did those people have
high levels of beta carotene

01:13:21.489 --> 01:13:22.280
in their blood?

01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:24.280
Ah, because they are
eating super-healthy foods,

01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:25.446
dark-green leafy vegetables.

01:13:25.446 --> 01:13:26.550
What has beta carotene?

01:13:26.550 --> 01:13:28.100
Sweet potatoes, right.

01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:32.220
So it's like a marker
for healthy eating.

01:13:32.220 --> 01:13:34.720
And actually beta carotene is
kind of a wimping antioxidant.

01:13:34.720 --> 01:13:36.790
So if you take beta
carotene, you kind of

01:13:36.790 --> 01:13:39.150
max out all your
carotenoid receptors.

01:13:39.150 --> 01:13:41.825
And then you eat tomato sauce
and have an even more powerful

01:13:41.825 --> 01:13:42.950
antioxidant, like lycopene.

01:13:42.950 --> 01:13:43.745
It goes right through you.

01:13:43.745 --> 01:13:44.500
It doesn't get absorbed.

01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:45.810
Because you just took
a beta carotene pill.

01:13:45.810 --> 01:13:48.335
That's what we think the
mechanisms behind that are.

01:13:48.335 --> 01:13:50.590
So we just don't know
enough about the biology

01:13:50.590 --> 01:13:54.300
to be able to kind of pick
and choose which nutrient.

01:13:54.300 --> 01:13:56.330
And then they tried
vitamin E supplements.

01:13:56.330 --> 01:13:57.750
And we had increased mortality.

01:13:57.750 --> 01:14:01.420
People were paying to shorten
their lives by buying vitamin E

01:14:01.420 --> 01:14:02.770
supplements for themselves.

01:14:02.770 --> 01:14:05.640
So it's that kind of data
that anytime someone tries

01:14:05.640 --> 01:14:08.560
to put these kind of isolated
nutrients and think, yes,

01:14:08.560 --> 01:14:09.920
can it keep you going?

01:14:09.920 --> 01:14:10.720
Absolutely.

01:14:10.720 --> 01:14:14.010
It's a great-- zombie
apocalypse, absolutely.

01:14:14.010 --> 01:14:17.860
Or an island-- starving
to death on an island.

01:14:17.860 --> 01:14:22.980
But in terms of maximizing
health and longevity,

01:14:22.980 --> 01:14:26.419
sticking to whole foods would
probably be a healthier option.

01:14:26.419 --> 01:14:28.460
AUDIENCE: Do you have same
concerns for something

01:14:28.460 --> 01:14:31.510
that's direct from whole
foods, like MealSquares?

01:14:31.510 --> 01:14:33.880
MICHAEL GREGER: So, yeah.

01:14:33.880 --> 01:14:37.320
So you can actually buy like
fruit and vegetable extract

01:14:37.320 --> 01:14:39.940
pills, like powdered
broccoli pills.

01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:42.920
And because 90% of
broccoli is actually water.

01:14:42.920 --> 01:14:45.840
And so you get 10 times
more broccoli in powered--

01:14:45.840 --> 01:14:48.270
but the pills are this big.

01:14:48.270 --> 01:14:51.340
So 10 times more broccoli
is like this much broccoli.

01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:53.150
That's still-- you're
only this much.

01:14:53.150 --> 01:14:55.890
Now, I would not be surprised
if people taking those pills

01:14:55.890 --> 01:14:56.890
actually had benefits.

01:14:56.890 --> 01:15:01.360
Because that's that much more
broccoli than most people eat.

01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:04.930
I mean you just can't get
kind of pounds of food

01:15:04.930 --> 01:15:06.760
in kind of the same way.

01:15:06.760 --> 01:15:09.746
And so, yeah.

01:15:09.746 --> 01:15:11.620
And once you get down
to chemical components,

01:15:11.620 --> 01:15:13.494
it doesn't really matter
where it comes from.

01:15:13.494 --> 01:15:18.200
Vitamin C is ascorbic acid
however you get it from,

01:15:18.200 --> 01:15:21.210
whether you make it
synthetically in a lab.

01:15:21.210 --> 01:15:21.710
Yes?

01:15:21.710 --> 01:15:24.584
AUDIENCE: So there's practical
component of all of this.

01:15:24.584 --> 01:15:29.014
So as an example, here at Google
we get lots of great free food.

01:15:29.014 --> 01:15:29.555
It's amazing.

01:15:29.555 --> 01:15:32.136
So I can go out and
get a huge helping

01:15:32.136 --> 01:15:35.857
of like broccoli, carrots,
and kale, and whatever.

01:15:35.857 --> 01:15:36.565
And that's great.

01:15:36.565 --> 01:15:41.440
And then my question
is A-- and I'm not

01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:42.870
complaining about the food.

01:15:42.870 --> 01:15:45.310
But A, none of that's organic.

01:15:45.310 --> 01:15:46.762
And so a question about that.

01:15:46.762 --> 01:15:48.700
And second, like
for instance here

01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:52.716
a lot of that's cooked
with canola oil.

01:15:52.716 --> 01:15:57.010
And so like do some of those
pieces sort of end cancelling

01:15:57.010 --> 01:15:57.510
out?

01:15:57.510 --> 01:15:57.820
MICHAEL GREGER: Hm.

01:15:57.820 --> 01:15:58.230
OK.

01:15:58.230 --> 01:15:58.580
Yeah, yeah.

01:15:58.580 --> 01:15:59.200
No.

01:15:59.200 --> 01:15:59.550
Yeah.

01:15:59.550 --> 01:16:01.841
There's been some interesting
kind of computer modeling

01:16:01.841 --> 01:16:02.410
studies.

01:16:02.410 --> 01:16:05.860
So there's one famous one of
food and chemical toxicology

01:16:05.860 --> 01:16:08.620
that suggested that
if half of Americans

01:16:08.620 --> 01:16:11.050
ate a single more serving
of fruits and vegetables,

01:16:11.050 --> 01:16:15.990
then we would prevent every
year 20,000 cancer deaths,

01:16:15.990 --> 01:16:18.180
not just cancer cases,
20,000 cancer deaths.

01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:21.639
People that would have died had
it not been for half of America

01:16:21.639 --> 01:16:23.930
eating more and more servings
of fruits and vegetables.

01:16:23.930 --> 01:16:25.846
That's how powerful
fruits and vegetables are.

01:16:25.846 --> 01:16:28.530
But because they were
modeling conventional fruits

01:16:28.530 --> 01:16:30.880
and vegetables, that
additional pesticide

01:16:30.880 --> 01:16:33.210
load from all that
extra conventional fruit

01:16:33.210 --> 01:16:36.420
and vegetable consumption, would
cause, in their estimation,

01:16:36.420 --> 01:16:38.290
10 cancer deaths.

01:16:38.290 --> 01:16:42.480
So you only end up
preventing 19,990 cancers.

01:16:42.480 --> 01:16:45.100
So you get this tremendous
benefit and then

01:16:45.100 --> 01:16:46.300
a small bump in risk.

01:16:46.300 --> 01:16:46.930
That's true.

01:16:46.930 --> 01:16:48.230
Why accept any risk at all?

01:16:48.230 --> 01:16:49.900
Choose organic, great.

01:16:49.900 --> 01:16:52.150
But we should never let
concern about pesticides

01:16:52.150 --> 01:16:54.960
prevent us from stuffing
our face with as many fruits

01:16:54.960 --> 01:16:57.426
and vegetables as possible.

01:16:57.426 --> 01:16:59.000
AUDIENCE: And what
about the oil too?

01:16:59.000 --> 01:16:59.970
MICHAEL GREGER: Oh, yeah.

01:16:59.970 --> 01:17:01.240
So if you're going
to cook with oil,

01:17:01.240 --> 01:17:03.080
canola would be probably
the best choice.

01:17:03.080 --> 01:17:06.930
So canola, obviously
it's processed.

01:17:06.930 --> 01:17:08.750
I think of oil as
kind of the table

01:17:08.750 --> 01:17:10.375
sugar of the carb kingdom.

01:17:10.375 --> 01:17:12.500
I mean you take a sugar
beet, a super-healthy food,

01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:13.690
you take out all the
nutrition, and you're

01:17:13.690 --> 01:17:15.160
left with table sugar.

01:17:15.160 --> 01:17:18.939
You take-- well, you
wouldn't take a canola plant.

01:17:18.939 --> 01:17:21.230
But you take a walnut and
you remove all the nutrition,

01:17:21.230 --> 01:17:23.097
and you're left with
walnut oil, though it still

01:17:23.097 --> 01:17:25.263
has some fats, [INAUDIBLE]
nutrients like vitamin E,

01:17:25.263 --> 01:17:25.800
et cetera.

01:17:25.800 --> 01:17:29.160
But someone just stole
the nutrition from you.

01:17:29.160 --> 01:17:31.580
And it's the most
calorically dense food.

01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:34.270
So one tablespoon is
like 120 calories.

01:17:34.270 --> 01:17:38.910
Like you ate 120 calories of
oil, you wouldn't even feel it.

01:17:38.910 --> 01:17:40.940
You had a hundred
calories of broccoli,

01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:42.650
a hundred calories
of strawberries,

01:17:42.650 --> 01:17:47.910
a hundred calories of tomatoes,
now that's a plate of food.

01:17:47.910 --> 01:17:49.940
So just in terms of
weight loss, in terms

01:17:49.940 --> 01:17:52.480
of nutrient density
in one's diet,

01:17:52.480 --> 01:17:56.010
you just wasted 5%
of your caloric bank

01:17:56.010 --> 01:17:59.070
for the day on
essentially nothing.

01:17:59.070 --> 01:18:00.650
Well, it has omega-3s.

01:18:00.650 --> 01:18:04.080
But you want to
kind of maximize.

01:18:04.080 --> 01:18:08.127
Every bite of something
has an opportunity cost.

01:18:08.127 --> 01:18:10.460
It's a lost opportunity to
eat something even healthier.

01:18:10.460 --> 01:18:11.380
That's how I kind
of think about it.

01:18:11.380 --> 01:18:11.760
Yes?

01:18:11.760 --> 01:18:12.630
AUDIENCE: I think we
have time for one more.

01:18:12.630 --> 01:18:13.611
MICHAEL GREGER: All right.

01:18:13.611 --> 01:18:15.084
AUDIENCE: So a
lot of vegetarians

01:18:15.084 --> 01:18:17.063
will look to things
like shakes or powders

01:18:17.063 --> 01:18:18.521
to supplement their
protein intake.

01:18:18.521 --> 01:18:20.604
Have they been any studies
on whey protein isolate

01:18:20.604 --> 01:18:22.940
and if [INAUDIBLE] the
same immune inflammation

01:18:22.940 --> 01:18:25.494
response as dairy, like a glass
of milk, a piece of cheese?

01:18:25.494 --> 01:18:26.410
MICHAEL GREGER: Right.

01:18:26.410 --> 01:18:27.130
Yeah.

01:18:27.130 --> 01:18:29.965
So whey, the biggest
problem with whey proteins

01:18:29.965 --> 01:18:31.470
is their high leucine content.

01:18:31.470 --> 01:18:34.090
So leucine is a branched
chain amino acid

01:18:34.090 --> 01:18:37.920
that activates this kind of
engine of aging enzyme called

01:18:37.920 --> 01:18:40.180
mTOR, which is a
fascinating story.

01:18:40.180 --> 01:18:41.680
I've got a bunch
of videos about it.

01:18:41.680 --> 01:18:44.780
It's just this really
neat detective story.

01:18:44.780 --> 01:18:48.919
I mean milk has
evolved to do what?

01:18:48.919 --> 01:18:49.960
To promote growth, right.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.540
So dairy milk, literally
to put a couple pounds

01:18:52.540 --> 01:18:54.120
on a calf in a matter of months.

01:18:54.120 --> 01:18:56.510
And so it's supremely
designed to both boost

01:18:56.510 --> 01:18:59.050
IGF-1, boost mTOR signaling.

01:18:59.050 --> 01:19:01.350
Boost can accelerate growth.

01:19:01.350 --> 01:19:05.220
Which is not so great if you've
already reached adult height.

01:19:05.220 --> 01:19:07.580
So accelerating growth,
so having growth hormones

01:19:07.580 --> 01:19:10.210
and growth factors in your body
at this stage, not so great.

01:19:10.210 --> 01:19:13.221
Because many of us are actually
harboring so-called occult

01:19:13.221 --> 01:19:13.720
tumors.

01:19:16.900 --> 01:19:19.990
So even women by their
40s-- they actually

01:19:19.990 --> 01:19:21.930
do autopsies studies,
if you get hit by a bus.

01:19:21.930 --> 01:19:23.570
They have microscopic
breast tumors.

01:19:23.570 --> 01:19:26.720
Most men actually have
microscopic prostate tumors.

01:19:26.720 --> 01:19:28.450
So, for example,
American men have

01:19:28.450 --> 01:19:31.970
the same rates of prostate
cancer as Japanese men,

01:19:31.970 --> 01:19:34.500
but a tiny fraction of the
death from prostate cancer.

01:19:34.500 --> 01:19:36.750
They die with their tumors,
instead from their tumors,

01:19:36.750 --> 01:19:40.540
because there's a
third stage of cancer.

01:19:40.540 --> 01:19:44.420
There's cancer initiation,
the first mutated DNA

01:19:44.420 --> 01:19:45.676
that creates the cancer cell.

01:19:45.676 --> 01:19:47.800
And then there's a promotion
stage, where it grows.

01:19:47.800 --> 01:19:49.220
It can grow for decades.

01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:51.490
Epithelial tumors,
like colon cancer,

01:19:51.490 --> 01:19:54.671
prostate cancer, breast cancer,
can take decades to grow.

01:19:54.671 --> 01:19:56.670
And then the progression
stage, where it kind of

01:19:56.670 --> 01:19:57.670
spreads around the body.

01:19:57.670 --> 01:20:02.840
But in that stage, I mean it
takes a billion cancer cells

01:20:02.840 --> 01:20:04.960
to show up on a mammography.

01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.000
So early detection
with mammography

01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.050
is really, really
late detection.

01:20:10.050 --> 01:20:12.640
And so it's all about
slowing the doubling time.

01:20:12.640 --> 01:20:15.340
So breast cancer cells
take between a few weeks

01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:18.080
to a few months to
double once in size.

01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:21.310
But we love the mathematics
of exponential growth.

01:20:21.310 --> 01:20:25.560
If you double 30 times, and
boom, we got a billion cells.

01:20:25.560 --> 01:20:28.250
But you don't care if
you get breast cancer

01:20:28.250 --> 01:20:29.330
in a century from now.

01:20:29.330 --> 01:20:31.060
You don't expect to
be around that long.

01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.800
So it's not just about
preventing cancer,

01:20:32.800 --> 01:20:34.640
but slowing down the
growth of cancer.

01:20:37.194 --> 01:20:39.110
And so the reason we
think that high the IGF-1

01:20:39.110 --> 01:20:41.440
levels, and high mTOR
signaling, and leucine intake

01:20:41.440 --> 01:20:43.820
is associated with
these cancers is

01:20:43.820 --> 01:20:47.590
because-- it's not that
they're causing the cancer.

01:20:47.590 --> 01:20:50.500
But they're kind of amplifying
the growth of whatever

01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:51.840
hidden tumors you have.

01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:55.080
And so they actually appear
within your lifespan,

01:20:55.080 --> 01:20:59.080
which is something that we
don't want to have happen.

01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.720
Happy to sign books for anyone.

01:21:00.720 --> 01:21:02.110
Thank you so much.

questions, please feel free,

01:21:04.060 --> 01:21:05.446
hesitate to call me any time.

01:21:05.446 --> 01:21:05.946

My contact information
is on the site.

01:21:08.680 --> 01:21:11.760
Oh, and take some DVDs,
