00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.300
Okay y'all, important question: If I kiss
a frog do I get a princess or do I get warts?

00:00:05.300 --> 00:00:13.499
Asking for 
a friend.

00:00:13.499 --> 00:00:18.980
This week's Viewer Question comes from Caitlin
Willix-Payne who wants to know: How / Why

00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:20.640
do warts form?

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:24.460
Chances are, you've heard people says "I love
my friend, warts and all!"

00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.640
A wart on the chin is the devil within!

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:28.890
Warts get a bad rap.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.430
They're associated with frogs and witches
and thought to be begat from having a mean

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:36.660
disposition, washing hands in water where
eggs were boiled, slaughtering a frog, or

00:00:36.660 --> 00:00:41.840
being a solitary young woman (victorian-speak
for a lady who masturbates).

00:00:41.840 --> 00:00:46.600
Regardless, warts have been viewed as an affliction
throughout history, writings in ancient Greek,

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.449
Roman and Egyptian texts all make references
to warts and their varying types; possible

00:00:51.449 --> 00:00:53.220
causes and cures…

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:57.110
But early 19th century scientists were the
first to explore their contagious nature,

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.320
and possible medical cures.

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:01.890
Warts are the second most common skin problem
humans face.

00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:03.750
Acne is number one.

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:08.840
Warts can occur anywhere on the skin, but
commonly show up on hands, feet and faces;

00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:14.240
and if you think about what's causing them,
that's by design!

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:17.650
Warts are caused by the human papilloma virus
-- that's right HPV.

00:01:17.650 --> 00:01:21.970
HPV is usually the name given to the sexually
transmitted infection; because they're the

00:01:21.970 --> 00:01:26.930
same TYPE of virus, but you're not getting
genital warts on your face, trust me.

00:01:26.930 --> 00:01:31.610
The human papilloma virus has over 100 different
strains, and only some of them cause warts

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.000
on the genitals; the strain can determine
which warts you'll have, but since everyone's

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.049
immune system is different some people won't
get warts at all; it's more common in kids

00:01:42.049 --> 00:01:43.049
and old people.

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.790
There are six different wart types.

00:01:45.790 --> 00:01:50.470
Common warts -- verruca vulgaris -- are roundish,
firm, and might look like a cauliflower; they're

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:52.009
usually on fingers or knees.

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:56.050
Verrucas -- plantar warts -- are white, flat
and form on the soles of the feet.

00:01:56.050 --> 00:02:00.500
I had one of these, that was the day I learned
doctors can "burn" things off you with dry

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:01.820
ice.

00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:03.150
Ouch.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:07.619
Filiform warts -- verruca filiformis -- are
slender and show up on the neck, face, eyelids

00:02:07.619 --> 00:02:08.680
and armpits.

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.650
Periungual -- show up under the fingernails
or toenails and are shaped like the nail;

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:17.890
and Mosaic warts and Plane warts (verruca
plana) will form in clusters that are either

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:22.880
flat or look like mosaic tiles on the face,
hands, foot soles and legs,.

00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:27.690
Normally warts will come and go; they're the
result of the HPV virus trying to spread,

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:30.000
because it spreads by skin-to-skin contact.

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.560
Generally, you can't just "catch" warts casually,
but it's possible.

00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:38.110
Wet or scraped skin will increase the chances
of spreading the virus; but you CAN get it

00:02:38.110 --> 00:02:46.720
from touching someone's towel, exercise equipment,
or walking barefoot where someone with the

00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:49.070
virus has walked.

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.540
If you HAVE a wart, scratching, biting, shaving,
or sucking on it can spread the virus around,

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:58.970
so don't do that.

00:02:58.970 --> 00:03:03.090
Because it's a virus, there's no cure, so
once you have it, you just… have it; but

00:03:03.090 --> 00:03:06.110
let's not fearmonger here… it's mostly nothing.

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:10.090
Plus, though the virus isn't curable, the
warts are.

00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:13.260
Remedies are available at most pharmacies,
but if you're feeling ambitious, you can use

00:03:13.260 --> 00:03:16.310
dry ice or duct tape -- look online for how.

00:03:16.310 --> 00:03:20.600
No joke, wrapping a wart in duct tape for
six days and then pumicing will remove a wart.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.300
It's weird, but it works.

00:03:22.300 --> 00:03:26.510
In the end, the HPV virus that causes warts
probably already exists inside of you.

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:32.760
6.2 million new HPV cases are reported every
year according to the CDC, and by age 50 -- 80

00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:34.950
percent of women will have it.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.160
It's real common.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.030
Vaccines exist to stop the dangerous strains;
so go get that if you ARE worried and you'll

00:03:42.030 --> 00:04:00.500
be all safe 
and stuff.
