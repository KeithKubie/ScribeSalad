00:00:00.850 --> 00:00:05.090
What is the least common
multiple of 36 and 12?

00:00:05.090 --> 00:00:08.492
So another way to say this is
LCM, in parentheses, 36 to 12.

00:00:08.492 --> 00:00:09.950
And this is literally
saying what's

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:13.250
the least common
multiple of 36 and 12?

00:00:13.250 --> 00:00:14.840
Well, this one might
pop out at you,

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.740
because 36 itself
is a multiple of 12.

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:20.600
And 36 is also a multiple of 36.

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.900
It's 1 times 36.

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:26.870
So the smallest number that is
both a multiple of 36 and 12--

00:00:26.870 --> 00:00:32.920
because 36 is a multiple
of 12-- is actually 36.

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.637
There we go.

00:00:33.637 --> 00:00:34.970
Let's do a couple more of these.

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.570
That one was too easy.

00:00:37.570 --> 00:00:40.910
What is the least common
multiple of 18 and 12?

00:00:40.910 --> 00:00:43.780
And they just state this
with a different notation.

00:00:43.780 --> 00:00:45.580
The least common
multiple of 18 and 12

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:47.090
is equal to question mark.

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:48.984
So let's think about
this a little bit.

00:00:48.984 --> 00:00:51.400
So there's a couple of ways
you can think about-- so let's

00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:53.358
just write down our
numbers that we care about.

00:00:53.358 --> 00:00:57.530
We care about 18,
and we care about 12.

00:00:57.530 --> 00:00:59.840
So there's two ways that
we could approach this.

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:01.850
One is the prime
factorization approach.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:04.030
We can take the prime
factorization of both

00:01:04.030 --> 00:01:06.340
of these numbers
and then construct

00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:08.960
the smallest number
whose prime factorization

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.190
has all of the ingredients
of both of these numbers,

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.070
and that will be the
least common multiple.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:14.310
So let's do that.

00:01:14.310 --> 00:01:20.770
18 is 2 times 9, which is
the same thing as 2 times 3

00:01:20.770 --> 00:01:23.570
times 3, or 18 is 2 times 9.

00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:24.860
9 is 3 times 3.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:30.030
So we could write 18 is
equal to 2 times 3 times 3.

00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:32.230
That's its prime factorization.

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:35.430
12 is 2 times 6.

00:01:35.430 --> 00:01:38.020
6 is 2 times 3.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:43.980
So 12 is equal to
2 times 2 times 3.

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:47.570
Now, the least common
multiple of 18 and 12--

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:52.280
let me write this down-- so
the least common multiple of 18

00:01:52.280 --> 00:02:01.220
and 12 is going to have to have
enough prime factors to cover

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:03.090
both of these
numbers and no more,

00:02:03.090 --> 00:02:06.130
because we want the least
common multiple or the smallest

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:07.990
common multiple.

00:02:07.990 --> 00:02:08.990
So let's think about it.

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.020
Well, it needs to have at
least 1, 2, a 3 and a 3

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:14.670
in order to be divisible by 18.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:15.810
So let's write that down.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:19.870
So we have to have
a 2 times 3 times 3.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:21.590
This makes it divisible by 18.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:24.142
If you multiply this
out, you actually get 18.

00:02:24.142 --> 00:02:25.350
And now let's look at the 12.

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.516
So this part right over
here-- let me make it clear.

00:02:27.516 --> 00:02:29.260
This part right over
here is the part

00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.439
that makes up 18, makes
it divisible by 18.

00:02:32.439 --> 00:02:33.230
And then let's see.

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:37.290
12, we need two 2's and a 3.

00:02:37.290 --> 00:02:42.220
Well, we already have one 3,
so our 3 is taken care of.

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:45.750
We have one 2, so this
2 is taken care of.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:47.170
But we don't have two 2s's.

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:49.180
So we need another 2 here.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.850
So, notice, now this number
right over here has a 2 times

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:56.990
2 times 3 in it, or it has a
12 in it, and it has a 2 times

00:02:56.990 --> 00:02:59.620
3 times 3, or an 18 in it.

00:02:59.620 --> 00:03:02.110
So this right over here is
the least common multiple

00:03:02.110 --> 00:03:03.500
of 18 and 12.

00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.580
If we multiply it out,
so 2 times 2 is 4.

00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:10.000
4 times 3 is 12.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:15.730
12 times 3 is equal to 36.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:17.226
And we are done.

00:03:17.226 --> 00:03:18.850
Now, the other way
you could've done it

00:03:18.850 --> 00:03:21.136
is what I would say
just the brute force

00:03:21.136 --> 00:03:23.510
method of just looking at the
multiples of these numbers.

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:24.960
You would say, well, let's see.

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:29.470
The multiples of 18
are 18, 36, and I

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:32.030
could keep going
higher and higher, 54.

00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:33.420
And I could keep going.

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:38.960
And the multiples of
12 are 12, 24, 36.

00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:41.920
And immediately I say, well, I
don't have to go any further.

00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.230
I already found a
multiple of both,

00:03:44.230 --> 00:03:46.260
and this is the smallest
multiple of both.

00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.145
It is 36.

00:03:48.145 --> 00:03:49.770
You might say, hey,
why would I ever do

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:52.310
this one right over here
as opposed to this one?

00:03:52.310 --> 00:03:53.530
A couple of reasons.

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:55.220
This one, you're
kind of-- it's fun,

00:03:55.220 --> 00:03:57.280
because you're actually
decomposing the number

00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:58.624
and then building it back up.

00:03:58.624 --> 00:04:00.790
And also, this is a better
way, especially if you're

00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:03.020
doing it with really, really
large and hairy numbers.

00:04:03.020 --> 00:04:05.170
Really, really, really
large and hairy numbers

00:04:05.170 --> 00:04:07.190
where you keep trying to
find all the multiples,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.100
you might have to go pretty
far to actually figure out

00:04:09.100 --> 00:04:10.840
what their least
common multiple is.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.464
Here, you'll be able to do it a
little bit more systematically,

00:04:13.464 --> 00:04:15.740
and you'll know
what you're doing.
