00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.829
what's up guys welcome back to the king

00:00:01.829 --> 00:00:03.060
of random labs where I've got a little

00:00:03.060 --> 00:00:05.430
experiment cooking up for a today now

00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.779
the inspiration for this experiment

00:00:06.779 --> 00:00:08.160
today goes back to the video where we

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.960
made the pull-tab smoke grenade you

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:11.580
might remember I cooked up a huge batch

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.259
of this rocket fuel to the point where

00:00:13.259 --> 00:00:14.340
it was spilling over the edges and

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.780
almost making contact with the burner

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:17.550
itself that made me a little bit nervous

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:18.690
because there was a chance the whole

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:21.060
thing could go up in my face at one so

00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.590
the purpose of this experiment is to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:24.539
find out just that how much heat can

00:00:24.539 --> 00:00:25.800
this mix your take before it will

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:28.320
spontaneously burst into flames oh and

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:30.359
we're going to test gunpowder too now if

00:00:30.359 --> 00:00:31.560
you ever stop to read the labels of any

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:33.300
pyrotechnic composition including

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.130
fireworks you'll probably see the basket

00:00:35.130 --> 00:00:36.480
to store it in a cool dry place away

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:39.540
from any flames heat or sparks but the

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.579
question really is how hot is too hot I

00:00:41.579 --> 00:00:42.750
mean say you have this stuff sitting in

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:44.040
your garage in the middle of summer and

00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.050
gets incredibly hot in there at what

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:47.700
temperature can we reasonably expect

00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:49.620
this stuff will go up not really sure

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.480
let's find out and the other question my

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.800
mind is what exactly happens to

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.390
gunpowder when you put on the stove does

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.250
it melt together does it go off in

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.750
flames or to sit there and do nothing

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:01.170
let's get cooking and find out so here's

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.309
what we're working with today I've got a

00:01:02.309 --> 00:01:04.080
20 gram mix of our rocket fuel because

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:05.220
when this goes off it's going to

00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:06.659
generate a lot of smoke and I want to

00:01:06.659 --> 00:01:08.580
limit it to 20 grand batch we've also

00:01:08.580 --> 00:01:10.200
got some pyro decks muzzleloading

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.939
propellant as well as some green dot

00:01:11.939 --> 00:01:13.439
smokeless gunpowder for reloading

00:01:13.439 --> 00:01:15.090
cartridges let's start off with the

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:16.770
rocket fuel first we'll throw this white

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:18.450
powder in a pan heat it up until it

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:20.310
caramelizes it and keep cooking it until

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.200
it burns too Chris I've also got an

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:23.549
infrared thermometer so we can keep

00:01:23.549 --> 00:01:25.020
track of the temperature as well as an

00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:26.880
IR camera so we can actually see the

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:28.890
heat changes taking place now that's

00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:30.479
going to take just a minute for this to

00:01:30.479 --> 00:01:32.549
start to warm up if I use a spatula we

00:01:32.549 --> 00:01:33.869
can help disperse the heat a little more

00:01:33.869 --> 00:01:35.820
evenly what's interesting is this starts

00:01:35.820 --> 00:01:37.409
off as a white powder but the sugar

00:01:37.409 --> 00:01:38.939
begins to caramelize and turn it into a

00:01:38.939 --> 00:01:41.189
syrup and observe the potassium nitrate

00:01:41.189 --> 00:01:42.810
into it and what the hits that

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:45.000
consistency we just back away slowly and

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.180
let it cook electricity buzzing bring

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:49.350
out our temperature gauge here we're

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:51.659
starting off at about 76 degrees

00:01:51.659 --> 00:01:52.860
Fahrenheit that's about room temperature

00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:54.869
right now if we go over the burner

00:01:54.869 --> 00:01:57.479
showing about 74 as well so the heat is

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.180
just coming on to that all right so it's

00:02:00.180 --> 00:02:01.890
in about forty-five seconds we're up to

00:02:01.890 --> 00:02:04.439
85 degrees Fahrenheit the burner is now

00:02:04.439 --> 00:02:05.140
at once there

00:02:05.140 --> 00:02:06.310
too so we're definitely on the right

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:10.630
looking good infrared cameras rolling at

00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:11.920
this point we just buckle down and watch

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:16.540
but there's usually about the point

00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:17.709
where I start getting nervous because

00:02:17.709 --> 00:02:19.209
when I see the stuff burning it makes me

00:02:19.209 --> 00:02:20.980
feel like it is going to burst into

00:02:20.980 --> 00:02:24.250
flames alright we're up to 350 now

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:26.140
there's quite a bit of smoke coming off

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:27.820
of this right now a lot of little black

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:29.230
spots where you can see everything's

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:30.940
been charged and it almost looks like

00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.100
this composition is cooking and drying

00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.720
out the bubbling is starting to reduce

00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:37.120
now the burner itself is over 500

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:38.680
degrees so it shows there is still quite

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.150
a bit of heat that can go into that pot

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:42.459
so I think we still have a chance for

00:02:42.459 --> 00:02:44.709
getting this to go off here oh we're up

00:02:44.709 --> 00:02:47.019
to 400 now the temperature is starting

00:02:47.019 --> 00:02:49.060
to rise you can see all the bubbling

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:51.850
stopped it's not gooey and bubbly like

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:53.440
it was before it's pretty much flattened

00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:55.120
out for the most part looks like a burnt

00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:56.950
oatmeal cookies now I've never played

00:02:56.950 --> 00:02:58.239
with rocket fuel that was hot before

00:02:58.239 --> 00:03:00.130
there's a chance that this could combust

00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.200
very vigorously if it starts from the

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:03.880
bottom it could actually explode out of

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.920
the pot and spew rocket fuel all over my

00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:08.470
workshop might be a good time to put on

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:11.290
the lab jacket checking what the

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:12.310
temperature gauge it seems to have

00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:13.720
leveled off around four hundred and

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:15.040
twenty degrees Fahrenheit it's not

00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:16.930
climbing much more than that but this

00:03:16.930 --> 00:03:18.670
whole thing is nearly black at this

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:21.760
point black and very burnt brown there's

00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:23.650
no bubbling there's no movement there's

00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:25.930
no hissing it's just sitting there

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:28.030
stagnating and starting to wonder if

00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.530
exceeding even go off at all of course

00:03:29.530 --> 00:03:30.820
if it doesn't that would be the best

00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:32.140
thing that could happen to us because we

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:33.489
don't want this stuff going off lower

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.110
cooking it doing so you know what I'm

00:03:35.110 --> 00:03:36.370
going to do is grab a fork and let's

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:37.780
poke this thing and flip it over like a

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.230
pancake and cook both side oh wow very

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:43.000
late and crispy almost like a meringue

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.310
so interesting update guys it's been

00:03:45.310 --> 00:03:46.660
about 15 minutes we've been cooking this

00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:48.970
thing on high heat we've got up to 430

00:03:48.970 --> 00:03:50.590
degrees Fahrenheit and instead of

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:52.269
combusting in the giant ball of flames

00:03:52.269 --> 00:03:54.640
instead of birth itself into a black ash

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:56.290
and at this point I'm not even sure if

00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:58.209
it's still on wall so why don't we take

00:03:58.209 --> 00:03:59.799
a spoonful of it and apply it directly

00:03:59.799 --> 00:04:02.460
to the burner itself

00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:10.960
all right here we go

00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.740
Oh giggle off a little bit interesting

00:04:14.740 --> 00:04:16.870
ok so Wow and come look at the residue

00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:19.690
here it's got kind of son victims gummy

00:04:19.690 --> 00:04:22.270
syrupy residue I'll look up in the

00:04:22.270 --> 00:04:23.680
ceiling you can actually see all the

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.720
smoke clouds lingering in the ceiling

00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:29.710
here now we got this mixture up to 400

00:04:29.710 --> 00:04:30.880
degrees Fahrenheit and it would not go

00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.500
off but when we applied it directly to

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.090
the burner it did go off relatively

00:04:34.090 --> 00:04:36.070
quickly the difference is the burner is

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:38.470
720 degrees Fahrenheit well the pot

00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:40.420
itself was just 400 the auto-ignition

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:41.920
temperature must be somewhere in between

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:43.900
that I guess the lesson to learn from

00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:45.070
this is if you're cooking this stuff

00:04:45.070 --> 00:04:46.600
make sure it doesn't fall on the burn

00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.140
all right so just for fun let's go ahead

00:04:50.140 --> 00:04:55.930
and pour the rest sweet look at the

00:04:55.930 --> 00:04:57.850
smoker role in feeling interesting

00:04:57.850 --> 00:04:59.500
update guys the syrupy stuff stuck to

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:01.870
the burner isn't a sugar composition at

00:05:01.870 --> 00:05:03.460
all it's actually molten potassium

00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:05.620
nitrate we can tell that because we use

00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.000
something like a paper towel to wipe it

00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:12.160
up it instantly begins to combust all

00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.390
right guys we got our workstation

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:14.620
cleaned up and we did learn a few things

00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.750
but I'm still not entirely satisfied I

00:05:16.750 --> 00:05:18.130
want to see the stuff burst into flames

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:20.380
as the temperatures still rising so this

00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:21.580
time I'm gonna make a new batch a little

00:05:21.580 --> 00:05:22.840
bit smaller and this time I'm going to

00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.520
build it directly on the burner itself

00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:29.310
it's amazing that haven't gone off

00:05:29.310 --> 00:05:33.240
820 degrees Fahrenheit I didn't know the

00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:38.969
burners get that hug

00:05:38.969 --> 00:05:43.019
there goes oh wow that was amazing that

00:05:43.019 --> 00:05:44.759
was amazing we got up to eight hundred

00:05:44.759 --> 00:05:46.979
and thirty-five degrees Fahrenheit and

00:05:46.979 --> 00:05:48.899
then it spontaneously combusted that one

00:05:48.899 --> 00:05:51.839
off really fast it's like sitting all

00:05:51.839 --> 00:05:53.069
these little fireballs in every

00:05:53.069 --> 00:05:54.809
different direction and that went off so

00:05:54.809 --> 00:05:56.549
fast I really wasn't expecting it by

00:05:56.549 --> 00:05:58.469
this point I was almost giving up on it

00:05:58.469 --> 00:05:59.909
actually happening and then boom there

00:05:59.909 --> 00:06:04.799
goes I have to admit that did take me a

00:06:04.799 --> 00:06:06.989
little bit off guard lots of fun lots of

00:06:06.989 --> 00:06:08.699
fireballs lots of smoke that's really

00:06:08.699 --> 00:06:10.889
cool that was amazing who got up to

00:06:10.889 --> 00:06:12.839
eight hundred and thirty-five degrees

00:06:12.839 --> 00:06:14.819
Fahrenheit and then it spontaneously

00:06:14.819 --> 00:06:16.110
combusted that one off really really

00:06:16.110 --> 00:06:18.479
fast and look at the black ash residue

00:06:18.479 --> 00:06:20.009
if you look closely you can still see

00:06:20.009 --> 00:06:22.319
the coals are glowing red down there

00:06:22.319 --> 00:06:24.569
what do that if I blow on it that is

00:06:24.569 --> 00:06:26.129
some of the glowing carbon left over

00:06:26.129 --> 00:06:28.139
from that sugar now that's up to

00:06:28.139 --> 00:06:29.399
temperature let's put it on a little bit

00:06:29.399 --> 00:06:30.329
more and see if we have the same

00:06:30.329 --> 00:06:35.249
reaction

00:06:35.249 --> 00:06:38.219
interesting that's very encouraging guys

00:06:38.219 --> 00:06:39.839
we actually had to max out this burner

00:06:39.839 --> 00:06:41.249
get up to eight hundred and thirty

00:06:41.249 --> 00:06:42.479
degrees Fahrenheit before the

00:06:42.479 --> 00:06:44.429
composition actually went off so it

00:06:44.429 --> 00:06:45.659
makes me a lot more confidence during

00:06:45.659 --> 00:06:47.129
this thing up because you really

00:06:47.129 --> 00:06:49.799
shouldn't be going over about 200-250 at

00:06:49.799 --> 00:06:52.049
most there's a really nice wide range of

00:06:52.049 --> 00:06:53.849
butter there when cooking up our Rockets

00:06:53.849 --> 00:06:55.769
cool so now it makes me wonder how would

00:06:55.769 --> 00:06:57.509
gunpowder react let's play up this

00:06:57.509 --> 00:06:59.429
workbench and try that next for our

00:06:59.429 --> 00:07:00.449
second experiment here we're going to

00:07:00.449 --> 00:07:02.609
try pyro decks I've got my burner back

00:07:02.609 --> 00:07:04.559
down to 420 degrees Fahrenheit right now

00:07:04.559 --> 00:07:06.599
I'm not sure if that's too hot or not so

00:07:06.599 --> 00:07:07.889
I'm just going to take a small spoonful

00:07:07.889 --> 00:07:09.659
of this sprinkle a few grains in the

00:07:09.659 --> 00:07:14.639
center do it happen it's already

00:07:14.639 --> 00:07:18.059
starting to smoke a little bit 590

00:07:18.059 --> 00:07:21.089
Fahrenheit we're at 660 Fahrenheit and

00:07:21.089 --> 00:07:24.629
climbing it's smoking pretty good though

00:07:24.629 --> 00:07:27.719
isn't it feel like that's got to go off

00:07:27.719 --> 00:07:32.339
in an instant any minute now 670 so this

00:07:32.339 --> 00:07:34.049
is the pyrotechnics we've maxed out at

00:07:34.049 --> 00:07:35.939
about 900 degrees Fahrenheit which is

00:07:35.939 --> 00:07:37.469
way higher than this thermometer can go

00:07:37.469 --> 00:07:39.719
and apparently is as high as this can go

00:07:39.719 --> 00:07:41.549
now in looking at the powder it's no

00:07:41.549 --> 00:07:43.409
longer a powder it's much down and

00:07:43.409 --> 00:07:46.229
turned into some kind of a sludge a

00:07:46.229 --> 00:07:48.059
black sludge I don't know if it's still

00:07:48.059 --> 00:07:50.309
flammable or not so to kill this stuff

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:51.749
off I'm going to take a plan from a BBQ

00:07:51.749 --> 00:07:53.999
matter and a field still at night here

00:07:53.999 --> 00:07:56.779
we go well more truth

00:07:57.289 --> 00:08:02.629
yep still works still works apparently

00:08:02.629 --> 00:08:04.580
our pyrotechnics will not light off even

00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:07.189
at 800 to 850 degrees Fahrenheit we had

00:08:07.189 --> 00:08:08.479
to go to the flame to get that to work

00:08:08.479 --> 00:08:11.360
next up smokeless gunpowder same routine

00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:12.589
as before we're starting the burner at

00:08:12.589 --> 00:08:13.460
five hundred and eighty degrees

00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:15.649
Fahrenheit and working our way up so

00:08:15.649 --> 00:08:17.180
we're actually down to about 530

00:08:17.180 --> 00:08:18.439
Fahrenheit here let's see how this works

00:08:18.439 --> 00:08:21.139
out a bit of powder in the middle and

00:08:21.139 --> 00:08:22.669
there goes wow that was instant and

00:08:22.669 --> 00:08:26.059
notice there is no smoke that is

00:08:26.059 --> 00:08:29.449
smokeless that's actually really cool so

00:08:29.449 --> 00:08:31.669
smokeless gunpowder apparently will take

00:08:31.669 --> 00:08:34.880
off a lot faster boom and look no smoke

00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:38.029
no smoke no residue just turn and burn

00:08:38.029 --> 00:08:40.190
and I could do this all day long so just

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:41.719
from this small experiment so far I'd

00:08:41.719 --> 00:08:43.219
say that smokeless gunpowder is a lot

00:08:43.219 --> 00:08:44.750
bigger fire hazard than any of the other

00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:47.089
compositions we've played with so far so

00:08:47.089 --> 00:08:48.380
I let our burner cool down to two

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:49.819
hundred eighty degrees Fahrenheit so we

00:08:49.819 --> 00:08:51.350
can add a small pile of smokeless

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:53.089
gunpowder to the center of the burner

00:08:53.089 --> 00:08:54.949
and then bring up the temperature I want

00:08:54.949 --> 00:08:56.389
to find out exactly what temperature

00:08:56.389 --> 00:08:58.610
this stuff goes off at all right let's

00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:00.980
turn up the heat my guess is this is

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:02.600
going to go out somewhere around 3 90

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.779
and 400 and here's what we're looking at

00:09:05.779 --> 00:09:07.850
work early 280 degrees Fahrenheit and

00:09:07.850 --> 00:09:16.220
started to climb 400 420 430 there you

00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:19.760
go 430 degrees Fahrenheit 430 degrees

00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.399
Fahrenheit that's pretty cool case we're

00:09:22.399 --> 00:09:25.100
back down to 410 Fahrenheit and the

00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.550
verdict is

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:31.160
it's still work there's nothing there

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.320
enough residual heat so i would say

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.210
anywhere between about 390 fahrenheit in

00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.370
about 430 is where the stuff is going to

00:09:37.370 --> 00:09:39.830
go off interesting let's turn off the

00:09:39.830 --> 00:09:40.940
burner and talk about what we just

00:09:40.940 --> 00:09:42.890
learned here today we entered this

00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:44.450
experiment with the purpose to find out

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:46.370
what temperature our solid state rocket

00:09:46.370 --> 00:09:48.050
fuel would go off if it accidentally

00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:49.940
came in contact with the burner from our

00:09:49.940 --> 00:09:51.320
experiments here today we saw that it

00:09:51.320 --> 00:09:53.390
would not auto ignite in the pot itself

00:09:53.390 --> 00:09:55.700
but instead burn to a crisp and grind

00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.650
down into a fine black ash but we also

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.330
saw that when we transfer that ash onto

00:09:59.330 --> 00:10:01.190
the hot plate itself it would still

00:10:01.190 --> 00:10:03.500
ignite so we tried an experiment making

00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.030
a new batch of rocket fuel and running

00:10:05.030 --> 00:10:06.440
it right on the burner itself and found

00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:07.820
that it would auto tonight somewhere

00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:09.080
around eight hundred and thirty degrees

00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:11.000
Fahrenheit next we try to commercial

00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.650
pyro decks muzzleloading propellant and

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:14.330
put it directly under the burner where

00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:15.860
we maxed out the heat maxed out the

00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:17.570
thermometer and had no successful

00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:19.730
auto-ignition instead of turn into some

00:10:19.730 --> 00:10:21.800
kind of a gloopy black page but we found

00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:23.390
that it still would ignite with a lick

00:10:23.390 --> 00:10:26.420
from a BBQ plan last but not least we

00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:28.070
tried smokeless gunpowder putting that

00:10:28.070 --> 00:10:29.420
directly on the hot plate we found that

00:10:29.420 --> 00:10:31.520
went up in an instant if we cooled the

00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:33.380
burner down to around 280 degrees and

00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.000
slowly warm it up from there where it

00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.770
auto ignited around 430 degrees

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.780
Fahrenheit we can come to the conclusion

00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:40.820
that the highest risk material for

00:10:40.820 --> 00:10:42.110
spontaneous combustion in your garage

00:10:42.110 --> 00:10:45.380
would be smokeless gunpowder although

00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:46.730
the chances of your garage getting up to

00:10:46.730 --> 00:10:49.070
400 Fahrenheit aren't very high well

00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:50.420
that is it for this set of experiments

00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.100
