00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
The answer is "no,"

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
because these numbers over here are too large.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Why is this bad?

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
You can see that in a maze like this you would expand node over here

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.000
before we touch any of the nodes over here.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If those are an optimal path, then we might miss them

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
and pick what might end up being a suboptimal path

00:00:20.000 --> 09:59:59.000
even though in this specific case all the paths seem to be equally good.
