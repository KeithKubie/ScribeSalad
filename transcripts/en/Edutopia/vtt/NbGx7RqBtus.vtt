00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.146
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: I guess the biggest
problem I had was the balance,

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:15.386
trying to get him to do
a little bit of outdoors,

00:00:15.876 --> 00:00:19.246
not to get so focused
on doing the technology.

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.776
Even if it wasn't a game, he still
wanted to be on the computer,

00:00:21.776 --> 00:00:27.756
so he will spend literally twenty
hours, if I let him, on the computer.

00:00:28.136 --> 00:00:31.496
So we sorta have a deal where,
after two or three hours,

00:00:31.716 --> 00:00:34.006
he's supposed to take
a break, go outside,

00:00:34.376 --> 00:00:36.066
walk up and down the
block or something.

00:00:36.546 --> 00:00:38.646
And he'd go, "Mom, you know,
I really have this balance.

00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:40.016
I got everything covered."

00:00:40.406 --> 00:00:42.246
So and I do feel that he has that.

00:00:42.296 --> 00:00:43.646
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: Well the
other thing I find too,

00:00:43.646 --> 00:00:48.576
that they multitask much
better than I ever did.

00:00:48.856 --> 00:00:51.006
Because my daughter could be doing
four or five different things,

00:00:51.366 --> 00:00:54.876
all at once, with the noise,
the music, and she's IMing

00:00:54.876 --> 00:00:58.026
and she's doing her
homework and she's texting.

00:00:58.026 --> 00:01:00.816
&gt;&gt;Clareice: They do research
papers on the internet.

00:01:01.206 --> 00:01:01.576
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: Mm-hmm.

00:01:01.736 --> 00:01:04.146
&gt;&gt;Clareice: The whole thing where
you get your bibliography, I mean,

00:01:04.146 --> 00:01:05.466
you know, certainly dating myself.

00:01:05.576 --> 00:01:06.916
&gt;&gt;Go to the library.

00:01:07.286 --> 00:01:10.806
&gt;&gt;Clareice: Go to the library, they
don't do research papers nothing

00:01:10.806 --> 00:01:12.926
like what we were trained to do.

00:01:12.926 --> 00:01:14.956
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: There's an issue
of plagiarism and they have

00:01:14.956 --> 00:01:16.326
to be very careful with that.

00:01:16.586 --> 00:01:21.026
So I think they step very cautiously
as they do their research and how

00:01:21.026 --> 00:01:24.026
to write what they've
read and translate,

00:01:24.026 --> 00:01:26.156
analyze and translate
that, and understand it.

00:01:26.196 --> 00:01:27.866
So I think it's a little
bit more rigorous.

00:01:28.106 --> 00:01:31.016
I mean, we did a lot more
legwork to do our papers, but--

00:01:31.016 --> 00:01:32.226
&gt;&gt;Yeah, but I found--

00:01:32.226 --> 00:01:32.456
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: Yes.

00:01:32.666 --> 00:01:35.426
They have to learn how to sort
and find this information.

00:01:35.426 --> 00:01:39.646
&gt;&gt;Clareice: You try to get a balance
between how much are you, you know,

00:01:40.056 --> 00:01:42.386
micromanaging their lives?

00:01:42.976 --> 00:01:45.256
Especially since they
don't want you there.

00:01:45.256 --> 00:01:48.636
You know, when they start hitting
seventeen, but I think as a parent,

00:01:48.636 --> 00:01:51.096
you still have to make
sure that you do it,

00:01:51.096 --> 00:01:53.556
because the digital
opens the world to them.

00:01:53.556 --> 00:01:56.196
It is just so all encompassing

00:01:56.196 --> 00:01:59.996
that if you stand back
too far, they'll get lost.

00:02:00.196 --> 00:02:03.876
&gt;&gt;Carolyn: Well, my daughter,
she was a little put off

00:02:03.876 --> 00:02:05.946
because I friended her on Facebook.

00:02:05.946 --> 00:02:06.996
She couldn't say no.

00:02:07.446 --> 00:02:11.866
So and it was with some trepidation
that I did it, but I friended her

00:02:11.866 --> 00:02:15.196
and some of-- and Ruby and Ellie too.

00:02:15.656 --> 00:02:18.296
And there are things that, I kind
of look from the side, you know,

00:02:18.296 --> 00:02:19.816
and I don't look directly at it,

00:02:19.816 --> 00:02:21.506
because some things
you don't wanna know.

00:02:21.876 --> 00:02:25.616
So what I do, once in a while, I go
and I look to see what's going on.

00:02:25.616 --> 00:02:26.796
What is she talking about?

00:02:26.796 --> 00:02:27.736
Who's she talking to?

00:02:28.056 --> 00:02:31.826
And I think they express themselves,
and it's their world and their forum.

00:02:31.886 --> 00:02:33.686
And I don't think they
sense any danger,

00:02:33.686 --> 00:02:36.036
and I think they feel this
freeness and openness.

00:02:36.376 --> 00:02:38.366
&gt;&gt;Sujatha: Even though
they think they're mature

00:02:38.366 --> 00:02:40.926
and know what they're doing,
sometimes what they write

00:02:40.926 --> 00:02:44.796
and everything on it, it concerns me.

00:02:45.536 --> 00:02:49.136
&gt;&gt;Clyneice: I do feel that as
long as you've got some oversight

00:02:49.136 --> 00:02:53.346
and you're not allowing them
to be totally kids and get

00:02:53.346 --> 00:02:56.246
into dangerous areas, that it's
one of the most wonderful things

00:02:56.246 --> 00:03:06.966
for them, because this is the
direction that the world is going in.

00:03:07.046 --> 00:03:08.366
