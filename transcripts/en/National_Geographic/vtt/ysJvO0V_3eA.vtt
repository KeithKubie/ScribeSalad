00:00:00.633 --> 00:00:04.233
[music playing]

00:00:04.233 --> 00:00:05.532
EMILY WATSON: Hi,
I'm Emily Watson.

00:00:05.533 --> 00:00:09.000
I play Elsa Einstein, a genius.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:10.567
Please don't.

00:00:10.567 --> 00:00:13.834
This is the third time I've
played Mrs. Geoffrey Rush.

00:00:13.834 --> 00:00:17.333
And we actually have a really
nice working relationship.

00:00:17.333 --> 00:00:20.232
We just have that sense of
feeling comfortable together,

00:00:20.233 --> 00:00:24.266
and we have a
physical familiarity.

00:00:24.266 --> 00:00:26.066
What I've really enjoyed
is the fact that Jeffrey

00:00:26.066 --> 00:00:27.366
and I look quite similar.

00:00:27.367 --> 00:00:29.633
We've both got these
kind of crazy gray wigs.

00:00:29.633 --> 00:00:31.467
And we're playing people
who've got to the stage

00:00:31.467 --> 00:00:32.934
where they just don't care.

00:00:32.934 --> 00:00:34.333
And that's really fun.

00:00:34.333 --> 00:00:36.500
When we were preparing, I
said, Geoffrey, I just--

00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:37.967
I think we're going
to have to play them

00:00:37.967 --> 00:00:40.132
as Tweedledum and Tweedledee.

00:00:40.133 --> 00:00:43.000
Almost twins, in a way.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.734
And, background action!

00:00:44.734 --> 00:00:45.734
Watching the coffin.

00:00:45.734 --> 00:00:47.467
EMILY WATSON: Here
comes the coffin.

00:00:47.467 --> 00:00:49.800
EMILY WATSON: I had such a
lovely time working with Ron.

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:50.632
Einstein!

00:00:50.633 --> 00:00:51.333
Like

00:00:51.333 --> 00:00:53.934
There's Einstein.

00:00:53.934 --> 00:00:54.666
Einstein.

00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:00.467
EMILY WATSON: He's such
a legend, isn't he?

00:01:00.467 --> 00:01:05.900
He's so clear and strong
and the way that he finds

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:08.066
that rhythm of storytelling.

00:01:08.066 --> 00:01:09.433
Albert!

00:01:09.433 --> 00:01:13.500
GEOFFREY RUSH: If
we leave, they win.

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:15.467
EMILY WATSON: It's
just really exciting.

00:01:15.467 --> 00:01:18.934
The idea of this man,
sort of really on his own,

00:01:18.934 --> 00:01:21.533
without what our sense of
what a modern scientific realm

00:01:21.533 --> 00:01:25.767
is, making these
immense discoveries.

00:01:25.767 --> 00:01:29.967
But also, being sort of right
at the center of history

00:01:29.967 --> 00:01:32.834
as the 20th century unfolds.

00:01:32.834 --> 00:01:33.667
Cutting.

00:01:33.667 --> 00:01:36.266
Checking.

00:01:36.266 --> 00:01:38.266
EMILY WATSON: Yeah, I
find it quite exciting.

00:01:38.266 --> 00:01:41.633
I hope that's what
people get from it.
