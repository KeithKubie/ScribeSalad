confidence so in an uncertain world I

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:21.180
confidence so in an uncertain world I
 

00:00:21.180 --> 00:00:23.030
confidence so in an uncertain world I
have to ask myself what am i certain

00:00:23.030 --> 00:00:23.040
have to ask myself what am i certain
 

00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:25.130
have to ask myself what am i certain
about am i certain of nothing and the

00:00:25.130 --> 00:00:25.140
about am i certain of nothing and the
 

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.140
about am i certain of nothing and the
answer is you can be certain about so

00:00:27.140 --> 00:00:27.150
answer is you can be certain about so
 

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.300
answer is you can be certain about so

for example right now it's winter I'm
 

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:33.889
for example right now it's winter I'm
certain it'll be spring followed by

certain it'll be spring followed by
 

00:00:33.899 --> 00:00:36.290

you notice the economists have been
really wrong lately why have they been

00:00:59.059 --> 00:00:59.069
really wrong lately why have they been
 

00:00:59.069 --> 00:01:00.979

about the next iPhone I know we just got
 

00:02:20.970 --> 00:02:23.540
about the next iPhone I know we just got
our new one but what about the next one
