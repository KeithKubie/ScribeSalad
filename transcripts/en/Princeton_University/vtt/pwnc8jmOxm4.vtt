00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:01.920
MITCHELL HAMMER: I define me.

00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.210
MONICA MAGALHAES: I define me.

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:04.668
ABIGAIL JEAN-BAPTISTE:
I define me.

00:00:04.668 --> 00:00:05.940
MADELEINE ST JOHN: 
I define me.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:07.590
LIZ ERICKSON: My
name is Liz Erickson.

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:09.690
I'm the director for
disability services

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:11.820
here at Princeton University.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.690
We're actually standing right
now in the new accessibility

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:16.680
center.

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.050
Last night we had the
grand opening celebration.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:26.565
[BACKGROUND CROWD TALKING]

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:28.590
So we wanted to create
a space where students

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:31.080
can come and be comfortable --
all students, not just

00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:32.759
students with disabilities.

00:00:32.759 --> 00:00:35.100
We intentionally
designed the space

00:00:35.100 --> 00:00:37.440
for physical and
technical access,

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.570
but we want it to be
also a place where

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:42.690
we can foster conversation,
to educate our community,

00:00:42.690 --> 00:00:45.150
where we can help
students with disabilities

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:48.144
to have a voice on campus, and
to provide some programming.

00:00:48.144 --> 00:00:49.560
MONICA MAGALHAES:
The thing that's

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.684
different about this space
is that the space really

00:00:51.684 --> 00:00:53.580
celebrates difference,
and by that, there's

00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:55.920
different things
in this space that

00:00:55.920 --> 00:00:59.380
are situated to how you
like to learn and study.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:01.260
So we have a standing
table if that's

00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.960
your preferred way of writing.

00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:05.062
We have stress balls.

00:01:05.062 --> 00:01:07.020
We have coloring books
for, like, when you just

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.017
need to de-stress.

00:01:08.017 --> 00:01:09.600
And I also think
it's really important

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:12.240
that there's a lot
of vivid colors

00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:13.890
that really keep
you excited to be

00:01:13.890 --> 00:01:15.765
in the space and, like,
awake and productive.

00:01:15.765 --> 00:01:17.306
MICHELE MINTER:
I'm Michele Minter.

00:01:17.306 --> 00:01:19.200
I'm the vice provost
for institutional equity

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:22.560
and diversity and the
University's ADA coordinator.

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:26.040
And I think this center is
a big moment for Princeton.

00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:31.110
This is our moment for
really celebrating,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.630
not just what disabilities
bring to our community,

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:35.760
but what all of the
differences in ability

00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:36.780
bring to our community.

00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.030
MITCHELL HAMMER: The space
has been a long time coming

00:01:39.030 --> 00:01:41.800
and it feels good,
I think, for people

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.800
in the community, outside
of the community, just

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:46.980
to have that official seal
of approval from Princeton

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:49.080
by having this space
available to them.

00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.060
Like so many other
affinity groups on campus

00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.620
have space that they
can connect with

00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:55.990
and, that's made for them,
and for their friends.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:58.140
LIZ ERICKSON: Students can
come in and have access

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.630
without the space
shouting out, you

00:02:00.630 --> 00:02:02.520
need an accommodation
for something.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:03.978
ABIGAIL JEAN-BAPTISTE:
We're hoping

00:02:03.978 --> 00:02:06.660
to lift some of the stigma
centered around disabilities

00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:11.039
with this space where people
can have conversations and just

00:02:11.039 --> 00:02:12.960
be in the same room
together as opposed

00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.477
to feeling like they're alone.

00:02:14.477 --> 00:02:16.060
MADELEINE ST JOHN:
I think it's great.

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:17.910
I think it's really
opened up the space.

00:02:17.910 --> 00:02:21.150
The colors and the
paintings, and it's really

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.870
created a warmer, nicer-sized 
space and a space,

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:27.212
I think, students would
really like to come to.

00:02:27.212 --> 00:02:28.920
LIZ ERICKSON: And we
really want students

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.690
to know that we are now open.

00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:33.410
We want to encourage students
to come and enjoy this space.
