WEBVTT

1
00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:07.890
Yeah.
Now time,
um,
as we'll find out,
um,

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:13.520
many of the titles of the novels,
I'll actually,
uh,
from,
uh,

3
00:00:13.560 --> 00:00:17.760
from,
from very,
um,
conomical work or you know,

4
00:00:17.761 --> 00:00:22.080
very ancient works.
In the case of Faulkner.
Um,

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:26.070
in the case of Hemingway,
um,
the title is from the book of common prayer,

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:30.030
give us peace in our time or Lord.
Um,

7
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:35.090
so it's very much is a meditation on war and peace and thinking about what

8
00:00:37.981 --> 00:00:42.300
happens in war and also thinking about what happens,
uh,

9
00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.010
when we have theoretical piece.
Um,

10
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:50.850
but maybe war is still going on in some fashion.
So it was really,
um,

11
00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.880
praying for peace.
Um,

12
00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:58.920
I should talk a little bit about the publication history of,
you know,
time.

13
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.040
Um,
yes,
uh,
very,
um,

14
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:06.600
interesting and complicated publication history.
Um,
initially,
um,

15
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:09.740
a lot of the vignettes from in our time out,

16
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.530
whether we would can't vignettes,
Hemingway cars,
chapters,
um,

17
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:16.680
those were published first.

18
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.880
So they were Polish in the little reviews and this one is actually called a

19
00:01:20.881 --> 00:01:25.470
little review.
Um,
and um,
so there are some published in there.

20
00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:30.510
And,
um,
some of the stories actually,
uh,
were also published,

21
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.170
um,
in the low reviews.
And this one is called,
um,

22
00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:38.670
what we now called Indian camp,
um,
that we'll be talking about today.

23
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:43.050
That was published in the Trans Atlantic Review.
Um,

24
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.140
and the first edition of in our time was actually published in Paris.

25
00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:54.960
Um,
it was published by the three mountains press,
um,

26
00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:59.580
very,
you know,
handcrafted look,
um,
in fact it was handcrafted,

27
00:01:59.930 --> 00:02:04.090
um,
only 30 pages.
So,
you know,
really just all the vineyards,
all the chapters.
Uh,

28
00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:06.120
we're in that edition.
Um,

29
00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.900
and only 170 copies were printed.
So,
you know,

30
00:02:09.901 --> 00:02:13.890
this is really the very beginning of Hemingway's Korea and it's really

31
00:02:13.891 --> 00:02:17.740
interesting to see that he bears how he started out.
Um,

32
00:02:17.790 --> 00:02:22.080
someone who really was thinking of 170 people reading his,

33
00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:24.900
his work.
Um,
and then,
um,

34
00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:29.500
but even though only 170 copies were printed,
um,

35
00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:33.990
it actually got very,
very warm responses right away.

36
00:02:33.991 --> 00:02:38.991
And it is actually amazing to think that it got picked up right away by,

37
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:44.040
um,
by Fitzgerald who wrote his editor,
Maxwell Perkins.

38
00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.660
Um,
as Scribner's,
um,
saying that,
um,

39
00:02:47.700 --> 00:02:51.630
the vineyards are really remarkable and I'll look him up right away.

40
00:02:51.631 --> 00:02:53.310
He's still real thing.
So,
you know,

41
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:57.810
this was back in 1924 when Hemingway was total unknown.

42
00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.900
Um,
so the,
uh,
addition,
um,

43
00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:06.900
first American edition,
uh,
was powered by Bonnie and liberal,
right.
Um,

44
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.500
this is Hemingway's first publisher.
He would then move onto Scribner's.
Um,

45
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:16.560
and Scribner's is the publisher that controls on the copyright to the,

46
00:03:17.220 --> 00:03:21.150
the,
the hemming,
all of Hemingway novels.
Um,
but he started out with,
um,

47
00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:25.590
Barney and liberal rate and there were a few more and um,

48
00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:27.190
not just within yes now,

49
00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:32.700
but a few of the stories were included in this edition 1950,

50
00:03:32.831 --> 00:03:36.580
25 edition of in our time.
Um,
but,
uh,

51
00:03:36.610 --> 00:03:40.630
still a very handmade look.
Um,

52
00:03:41.590 --> 00:03:42.423
and,
uh,

53
00:03:42.550 --> 00:03:47.550
Hemingway did not have a very happy relation to Bonnie and they were right.

54
00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:52.810
Um,
and mostly having to do with the structure,
um,

55
00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:57.640
of the,
of in our time.
Um,
so he,
um,
um,

56
00:03:57.700 --> 00:04:00.550
on April 20th second he wrote to his good friend,

57
00:04:01.030 --> 00:04:03.310
author John Dos Passos saying,

58
00:04:03.970 --> 00:04:06.640
and this is George Kaufman is here.

59
00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:09.970
And she claims they want to cut it all out.

60
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:15.400
Indian camp story cut the in our time chapters.
Jesus,

61
00:04:15.610 --> 00:04:17.440
I feel all shot to hell about it.

62
00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:22.530
Of course they can do it because the stuff is so tight and hard and everything

63
00:04:22.691 --> 00:04:24.460
hands on everything else.

64
00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:29.470
So this is 1925 but already we can see,
um,

65
00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.510
the Hemingway that we recognize later,
somebody who love

66
00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:41.250
his material wants as material to be tight and hard and everything hanging on

67
00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.060
everything else.
But still it is a very,

68
00:04:46.061 --> 00:04:51.061
very strange claim given the fact that in fact the publication history of in our

69
00:04:52.961 --> 00:04:56.860
time suggest that it wasn't conceived of.

70
00:04:56.860 --> 00:05:00.580
And it wasn't initially published as on one piece.

71
00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.880
It was actually published separately.
So I'm very,

72
00:05:05.350 --> 00:05:08.860
but meanwhile,
Hemingway is going to claim that in fact,

73
00:05:08.920 --> 00:05:13.900
he wants everything on one piece.
So,
um,

74
00:05:13.930 --> 00:05:17.640
I think that this is something that we should really think about,
you know,

75
00:05:17.641 --> 00:05:20.650
was you certainly take Hemingway very seriously.
Um,

76
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:24.520
that is insisting that everything is hanging together.
Um,

77
00:05:24.550 --> 00:05:29.230
but also maybe entertaining the possibility,

78
00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.070
uh,

79
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:35.070
that may be the loser than he would like to thing or the he claims.

80
00:05:35.830 --> 00:05:40.540
Um,
so let's think about,
rather than taking him away completely,

81
00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:44.980
um,
at his word,
let's just say,
um,
that,
uh,

82
00:05:45.010 --> 00:05:50.010
we'll think of the narrative structure of in our time as a puzzling structure,

83
00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:54.400
um,
that,
and this is something that we can say,
I mean,

84
00:05:54.401 --> 00:05:59.030
there's not much dispute about it.
Looks,
doesn't look like,
um,
you know,

85
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:03.560
short story collection doesn't look like anything else that we've read.
Um,

86
00:06:03.620 --> 00:06:08.620
so this is very unusual structure of the stories being interspersed with the

87
00:06:09.021 --> 00:06:12.560
chapters.
Um,
and the seems to be,
uh,

88
00:06:12.620 --> 00:06:17.180
an apparent disjunction between these two.
Um,

89
00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:21.170
and this also kind of very rapid shift,
um,

90
00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:24.130
of location and perspective,
um,

91
00:06:24.200 --> 00:06:28.670
between those pieces that are said in wartime Europe.

92
00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.630
Um,
and those,
the set in peacetime,
um,

93
00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:34.940
America in the Midwest,
um,

94
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.080
so it doesn't work as a linear,

95
00:06:39.260 --> 00:06:43.580
streamlined kind of narrative.
It doesn't look like the traditional novel.

96
00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.130
It doesn't look like a collection of short stories.

97
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.870
So in the Sunday to think about a puzzle over.
Um,

98
00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:56.320
so what I like to do today is actually to give Hemingway the benefit of the

99
00:07:00.711 --> 00:07:01.790
doubt.
Um,

100
00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:06.860
he's saying that everything hangs together so less we three pieces as if they

101
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:17.420
did in fact hand together.
Okay.
So,
you know,
this is uh,
an experiment in reading.

102
00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.970
Um,
you know,
we can,

103
00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.970
we can never prove for sure that they do in fact hand together,

104
00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:27.290
but because Hemingway is so emphatic about it,
um,

105
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:31.070
let's just do this little experiment or reading three,

106
00:07:31.310 --> 00:07:36.010
two stories and then one chapter,
one into chapter,
um,

107
00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:40.020
as if they all belong together as a unit.
But to say that it's also,

108
00:07:40.021 --> 00:07:43.920
it's also the say that,
you know,
you guys can experiment with other clusters,

109
00:07:43.921 --> 00:07:46.310
right?
You know,
the cluster is this is a possible cluster.

110
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:49.850
You can experiment with other possible clusters.
So,
you know,

111
00:07:49.851 --> 00:07:51.910
when it comes to writing papers business,

112
00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:56.600
a great opportunity to try out to see which goes with what,

113
00:07:57.170 --> 00:08:01.880
um,
so the three that I'm proposing to read together,
this was,
well,
Indian camp,

114
00:08:01.881 --> 00:08:05.120
we know for a fact that that was published separately.

115
00:08:05.121 --> 00:08:07.340
So let's not forget that for a moment.
Okay.

116
00:08:07.580 --> 00:08:11.000
But still given that it was initially published in the Trans Line Review,

117
00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:15.930
less group it with the attitude.
Um,
and in chapter two,
and then doctor,

118
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:18.470
doctor and doctor doctor's wife to reason that,
um,

119
00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:22.070
those three hang together in my mind,
um,

120
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.660
is that they actually have the same kind of thematic,
um,

121
00:08:27.170 --> 00:08:28.020
uh,
the,

122
00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.750
the work on the same thematic registered and they also work on the same,

123
00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:36.700
um,
kind of macro micro registers,
um,

124
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.030
that we were talking about last time.
So the Macro Register,

125
00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:46.030
um,
is that there is the tension between the Anglos and the native Americans.

126
00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:47.150
Right.
Both of these stories,

127
00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:52.040
let's leave on the chapter first because it is obviously not something else.
Um,

128
00:08:52.130 --> 00:08:55.470
but in income and a doctor in the doctor's wife,
um,

129
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.320
they both are about the relation,

130
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:02.480
they trained Anglos and then the native Americans.
Um,

131
00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.510
and about the tension conflict,
um,
between them,
um,

132
00:09:06.570 --> 00:09:10.030
and both stories.
Um,
also share,
uh,

133
00:09:10.260 --> 00:09:15.030
some important similarity on the micro register.
Um,

134
00:09:16.170 --> 00:09:20.220
the Indian camp obviously is about the phenomenon of pain.

135
00:09:20.640 --> 00:09:23.700
I'm in about violence to oneself,
about injury.

136
00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:28.080
About injury to others about,
um,
about violence to oneself,

137
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.120
um,
and the doctor and the doctor's wife is about,

138
00:09:32.130 --> 00:09:34.410
or potential violence,
right?
You know,

139
00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.760
fight could break out in their storage.
Um,
but it doesn't,

140
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:42.930
so in some sense is the opposite of Indian camp.

141
00:09:43.130 --> 00:09:48.000
It is about the possibility of violence that has been avoided.
So,

142
00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:48.270
you know,

143
00:09:48.270 --> 00:09:52.920
just on that basis it would seem that there's some kind of relation between
them.

144
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:58.520
Um,
so let's look at the macro register.
The first,
I mean,

145
00:09:58.521 --> 00:10:02.340
it's not as macro is,
you know,
the history of World War One.
Um,

146
00:10:02.430 --> 00:10:07.430
but there's macro in the sense that is really is about important sociological,

147
00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:13.050
um,
Platte valley,
United States.
Um,
the stories as said,
um,
in Houghton Bay,

148
00:10:13.410 --> 00:10:15.350
um,
Ashley,
this is where,
um,

149
00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:20.220
the Hemingway family with go further some of occasions is in Michigan.

150
00:10:20.670 --> 00:10:25.550
Um,
and,
um,
the native Americans are legit way,
uh,
uh,

151
00:10:25.650 --> 00:10:28.800
as an NRB.
Um,

152
00:10:28.890 --> 00:10:33.870
the actually the proofer a destination by them,
but mostly,

153
00:10:34.020 --> 00:10:36.970
you know,
the Ojibwe I think is the more common name.
Um,

154
00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:42.020
very well known group of very important group of native Americans.

155
00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:47.400
So there's a whole book written about them.
Um,
and um,

156
00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:49.830
and I also,
so this is the,

157
00:10:50.080 --> 00:10:54.810
this is the background to the macro history,
um,

158
00:10:54.870 --> 00:10:59.250
of the two stories.
Um,
and I like to introduce,
um,

159
00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.080
three,
um,

160
00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:05.780
additional perspectives now on the micro level a,

161
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.000
which is talking about the phenomenon of pain and injury and violence and so on.

162
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:15.870
And,
um,
you might or might not have,
um,
read these people,

163
00:11:15.871 --> 00:11:20.850
but they've very influential people,
including a,
obviously a great painter,
uh,

164
00:11:20.851 --> 00:11:23.250
writing about pain and injury and so on.

165
00:11:23.251 --> 00:11:28.251
So let's just pick Elaine scary Susan Sontag and even more.

166
00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.430
Um,
so let's just begin with Elaine.
Scary.
Um,

167
00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.940
this is a book that came out in the eighties,
1980s,
a,

168
00:11:37.110 --> 00:11:40.290
it's called a body in pain.
Um,
and,
um,

169
00:11:41.220 --> 00:11:46.220
a lot of it I'm Ashley has to do and she's done extensive research with an and

170
00:11:46.651 --> 00:11:50.560
using the archives at Amnesty International,
uh,

171
00:11:50.610 --> 00:11:54.610
looking at the phenomenon of paying this a consequence of torture.
Um,

172
00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:59.590
and the argument about the book is that,
um,
that when,

173
00:11:59.710 --> 00:12:02.670
uh,
prisoners torture,
uh,

174
00:12:02.680 --> 00:12:07.680
when there's really nothing in the world open to them except for the experience

175
00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:12.520
of pain,
um,
then they lose the ability,
um,

176
00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:13.900
to express themselves.

177
00:12:13.901 --> 00:12:18.901
They lose the ability to have any kind of linguistic relation to the world,

178
00:12:19.450 --> 00:12:22.370
including the linguistic relation of being,

179
00:12:22.430 --> 00:12:24.790
to able to describe your own pain.

180
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:29.880
So what she argues is that there's a breakdown of language under extreme

181
00:12:32.201 --> 00:12:34.600
conditions or pain.
That pain basically

182
00:12:36.100 --> 00:12:38.250
brings down our world.
And the first thing,

183
00:12:38.270 --> 00:12:42.860
the most important thing to go is our language because the coin into the lane

184
00:12:42.861 --> 00:12:47.480
scary.
It is language that angers and constitutes our well.

185
00:12:47.950 --> 00:12:51.250
So,
um,
it is an argument about,
um,

186
00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:56.280
the power of pain and its ability to dehumanize us because,

187
00:12:57.700 --> 00:12:58.090
uh,

188
00:12:58.090 --> 00:13:03.040
it takes away our ability to do the most fundamentally human thing,

189
00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:06.230
namely to speak,
use language.
Um,

190
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:09.850
so this is one end of the spectrum.
Um,

191
00:13:09.910 --> 00:13:13.630
in thinking about pain on the other end of the spectrum of very,

192
00:13:13.631 --> 00:13:18.130
very different kind of philosophy,
um,
is um,
the,

193
00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:22.840
uh,
public intellectual.
Susan Sontag in my have a she that she is,

194
00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:27.760
she died,
um,
for you.
Uh,
but um,
her work has been really,

195
00:13:27.761 --> 00:13:32.230
really important,
uh,
for,
for many,
for decades really.
Um,

196
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.010
and one of whom Moses,
uh,

197
00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.360
one of the best known bugs is called regarding the pain of others.

198
00:13:38.560 --> 00:13:43.000
She really has a complete different and tig on pain,
um,
from Elaine.
Scary.

199
00:13:43.001 --> 00:13:44.830
She argues that,
um,

200
00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:48.400
rather than thinking about the phenomenon of paying the self as a kind of

201
00:13:48.401 --> 00:13:51.670
experiential reality for us,
um,

202
00:13:51.730 --> 00:13:54.010
she was interested in how um,

203
00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:58.960
the observation or pain in others,
uh,

204
00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:03.990
gives us pleasure that in some sense we are affirmed with Afirma on being we are

205
00:14:06.161 --> 00:14:07.150
from ourselves.

206
00:14:07.420 --> 00:14:11.930
We affirmed the fact that we are not feeling pain when we see pain in others are

207
00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.420
very tough and in many ways of kind of disturbing argument,

208
00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:17.380
um,

209
00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:22.380
that argue her basic sense of the world is that we affirm our own being by being

210
00:14:25.931 --> 00:14:30.820
able to tell ourselves across from others.
So when we see someone in acute pain,

211
00:14:31.030 --> 00:14:32.860
we know that we are someone else,

212
00:14:32.890 --> 00:14:35.710
that we are what we are because we're not going through that pain.

213
00:14:36.130 --> 00:14:41.130
So there's kind of indirect pleasure from seeing the pain and others and speed

214
00:14:42.790 --> 00:14:46.960
in the cover of her book.
Um,
so it's a very disturbing,

215
00:14:47.080 --> 00:14:51.680
but something to keep in mind.
Um,
and,
uh,
the,

216
00:14:54.050 --> 00:14:58.300
both of those models I want to call to your attention,
uh,

217
00:14:58.640 --> 00:15:03.110
because I think that that Hemingway,
um,
actually,
uh,

218
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:06.920
has something to say,
um,
to each of them.

219
00:15:06.950 --> 00:15:11.360
Ashley and I will encourage you in session to think about how he would help me

220
00:15:11.361 --> 00:15:15.830
with the se to Elaine.
Scary where Hemingway was say to Susan Sontag.
You,
no,

221
00:15:15.831 --> 00:15:17.450
he obviously wasn't writing for them,

222
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:20.570
but given the fact that he has written stories that have to do with pay,

223
00:15:20.780 --> 00:15:24.890
how he would respond to those,
um,
to those theories.
Um,

224
00:15:24.920 --> 00:15:29.770
but I think that Hemingway is actually closer to this,
um,
to the painter munch,

225
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:34.090
um,
and the very celebrated,
uh,

226
00:15:34.130 --> 00:15:36.770
painting the scream.
Um,

227
00:15:36.860 --> 00:15:41.660
and it's really about paying as a sound,
right?

228
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:46.050
So paying,
coming out as a screen.
Um,

229
00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:50.520
and it is a corrective to Elaine,

230
00:15:50.521 --> 00:15:55.521
scary in the sense that even though we might not be able to speak,

231
00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.700
uh,
when we're in acute pain,

232
00:15:59.270 --> 00:16:02.900
we still are able to express ourselves because we can just cry out even though

233
00:16:02.901 --> 00:16:05.420
is no linguistic is not the word that we're saying.

234
00:16:05.690 --> 00:16:09.820
The very fact that something is coming out of a suggest that um,

235
00:16:09.920 --> 00:16:14.920
the capacity for expression has an a completely broken down.

236
00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:16.733
Um,

237
00:16:17.040 --> 00:16:22.040
we were just not especially interested in thinking about what the screen will do

238
00:16:24.951 --> 00:16:26.300
to others.
Right.
You know,

239
00:16:26.301 --> 00:16:31.301
so basically this is just somebody who is crying out in pain and probably not

240
00:16:32.031 --> 00:16:36.610
bodily injury either,
but just psychic pain,
just screaming up.
Um,

241
00:16:36.710 --> 00:16:40.200
we're just not putting into the picture.
Um,

242
00:16:40.460 --> 00:16:45.460
what the scream would do to other people listening to that screen.

243
00:16:46.880 --> 00:16:51.880
So I would like to see a Hemingway as collaborating with mortgage.

244
00:16:52.190 --> 00:16:56.990
Weren't,
is giving us the scream coming out of the person who is suffering.

245
00:16:57.530 --> 00:17:02.530
And in the end cam is Hemingway's extended meditation on the phenomenon of the

246
00:17:05.601 --> 00:17:10.601
screen screen on what the screen would do to people who are completely

247
00:17:12.530 --> 00:17:16.490
vulnerable to that sound or pain.
Um,

248
00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:19.910
usually we just think of ourselves as being vulnerable to pain,

249
00:17:20.510 --> 00:17:24.640
but we are also vulnerable to the standard pain.

250
00:17:24.650 --> 00:17:29.650
So this is a very different model from the one suggested by Susan Sontag.

251
00:17:30.170 --> 00:17:30.381
You know,

252
00:17:30.381 --> 00:17:34.660
I'm already giving you a bit of an argument about having way we'll say says.
Um,

253
00:17:34.730 --> 00:17:38.360
sometimes it's really thinking about pain as a kind of a visual measure that to

254
00:17:38.361 --> 00:17:43.340
other people we see other people suffering and we get some visual pleasure

255
00:17:43.670 --> 00:17:48.670
having way is about all his rape pain that we again,

256
00:17:49.890 --> 00:17:54.890
as a consequence of our ears being helplessly open to the pain of others.

257
00:17:55.801 --> 00:18:00.510
So this basically a very different important difference between the eye and the

258
00:18:00.511 --> 00:18:03.780
ear.
And I think most people would agree that we can shut our eyes.
You know,

259
00:18:03.781 --> 00:18:06.820
we don't have to see something if don't want you out.

260
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:08.980
We couldn't really shut out use.
Um,

261
00:18:09.150 --> 00:18:12.420
we can remove ourselves to greater distance and shut out.
You use that way.

262
00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:16.500
But if we're in enabling of someone who is screaming can really shut out,
we use,

263
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:17.250
um,

264
00:18:17.250 --> 00:18:22.250
so Indian camp is really about what happens when someone cannot shut his or her

265
00:18:26.400 --> 00:18:30.430
ears,
uh,
to a screen.
So,
um,

266
00:18:30.540 --> 00:18:34.680
it's about a woman giving birth.
Um,

267
00:18:34.830 --> 00:18:35.970
and uh,

268
00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.980
next father who's a doctor coming to attend to that woman,
um,

269
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:42.210
is about,
uh,

270
00:18:42.270 --> 00:18:47.270
who Anglo doctor coming to a very close knit native American community to take

271
00:18:49.351 --> 00:18:52.860
care of them.
American woman.

272
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.110
And they're very primitive conditions.
Um,
but having ways,

273
00:18:57.170 --> 00:19:00.000
whereas a lot of time,
Ashley,

274
00:19:00.210 --> 00:19:04.230
not just talking about Anglo and Indian relations,

275
00:19:04.560 --> 00:19:08.490
but also about the relations among native Americans,
right?

276
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:13.520
So this is how the men react to the woman giving birth and screaming.

277
00:19:14.790 --> 00:19:19.790
The man had moved up the road to sit in the dark and smoke of range of the

278
00:19:21.211 --> 00:19:22.260
noises she made.

279
00:19:22.710 --> 00:19:27.660
She screamed as nick and the two Indians followed his father into the Shanti.

280
00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:29.670
Um,
so

281
00:19:31.710 --> 00:19:36.710
this is actually the baseline for Hemingway is that the scream is unbearable

282
00:19:39.690 --> 00:19:42.240
even to her own community.

283
00:19:42.330 --> 00:19:47.330
This is someone who is actually inflicting pain and injury on her own native

284
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:55.710
American community,
not because of any conflict with them.
Right?

285
00:19:55.711 --> 00:20:00.711
So this is very important fact to know this is not a socio political conflict,

286
00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.080
socio economic conflict.

287
00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:08.760
It is not the conflict between two different ethnic groups.

288
00:20:09.150 --> 00:20:14.150
It is an involuntary conflict within one close knit ethnic group.

289
00:20:16.171 --> 00:20:18.360
The woman can help screaming.

290
00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:23.660
She can't help causing pain to her own community.

291
00:20:23.940 --> 00:20:28.890
So the man are trying to do the best they can to get themselves out of the way,

292
00:20:29.070 --> 00:20:33.720
um,
of the,
of the painful,
um,
screaming that they're hearing.

293
00:20:34.310 --> 00:20:35.130
Um,

294
00:20:35.130 --> 00:20:40.130
and we can think about what follows from this given from this baseline.

295
00:20:41.050 --> 00:20:44.370
Um,
and actually there are two outcomes.
Um,

296
00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:49.480
and one outcome is actually,
um,

297
00:20:49.690 --> 00:20:54.520
very much predicated on the importance of ethnic difference.

298
00:20:54.521 --> 00:20:57.610
So here are the native American men,
uh,

299
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:02.700
being completely overwhelmed and helpless in the phase of the screen.

300
00:21:03.970 --> 00:21:05.320
But one person,

301
00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:09.940
one person who's not affected by this room,

302
00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:15.580
why is he not the fact that by those screens are not important?

303
00:21:16.300 --> 00:21:19.780
I don't hear them because they are not important.

304
00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:21.790
Who is it says that

305
00:21:24.170 --> 00:21:27.920
the doctor exactly.
Thank you.
Is Nick's bother.

306
00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.950
So what enables him,

307
00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:35.780
what is it that insulates him from the screen?

308
00:21:37.220 --> 00:21:42.220
It seems that if there was something else that can override that's,

309
00:21:44.411 --> 00:21:48.440
um,
something else that is more important to you,

310
00:21:48.740 --> 00:21:50.800
then the immediacy of that song.

311
00:21:51.140 --> 00:21:55.970
It can serve as a protective shell.
And as it turns out,

312
00:21:56.030 --> 00:21:59.830
it is the doctor's professional identity does,

313
00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:02.480
he's able to explain to nick.
Um,

314
00:22:02.510 --> 00:22:07.340
what she's going through is something called Labor.
The baby wants to be born,

315
00:22:07.670 --> 00:22:08.910
the baby's trying to be born.

316
00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.770
She was trying her best and that the baby would be born.
Um,

317
00:22:12.830 --> 00:22:17.830
he has the completely coherent explanation as to why she's going through the

318
00:22:18.441 --> 00:22:23.441
pain and he has a completely coherent explanation as to why she's screaming

319
00:22:23.750 --> 00:22:24.500
right now.

320
00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:29.500
So the coherence of that explanation and the fact that he is professionally

321
00:22:31.011 --> 00:22:35.720
equipped to put an end to this way of the fact that he as a doctor can just

322
00:22:35.721 --> 00:22:39.860
perform.
This is,
they're in operation.
So the screen,
we'll stop.
Um,

323
00:22:39.950 --> 00:22:44.780
both his ability to explain a phenomenon and its ability to put an end to the

324
00:22:44.781 --> 00:22:49.781
phenomenon dose to work together so that the scream wild,

325
00:22:50.870 --> 00:22:55.430
a fact of life is not going to be devastating to the doctor.

326
00:22:55.490 --> 00:22:56.570
And we all know that,
right?

327
00:22:56.571 --> 00:22:59.850
If the office we're going to be devastated by the screams,
they won't be nothing.

328
00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:00.980
They will be able to operate.

329
00:23:01.250 --> 00:23:06.250
So a very important feature of the professional identity of a doctor is that

330
00:23:07.191 --> 00:23:12.191
they should be able to launch to take a lot of sensory input that would be

331
00:23:12.921 --> 00:23:17.921
unbearable to other people and be able to put that sensory input in his place.

332
00:23:20.050 --> 00:23:20.480
Um,

333
00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:25.480
being able to explain it is being to put it away and being able to cope with it.

334
00:23:25.940 --> 00:23:28.460
And here's the Golfer being able to cope with that.

335
00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:33.230
So this is one possible outcome is that this basically a kind of neutralization

336
00:23:33.890 --> 00:23:38.330
of the swim.
Um,
it is not piercing.
It is not those stadium,

337
00:23:39.140 --> 00:23:43.120
but the process of neutralization doesn't always take place.

338
00:23:43.250 --> 00:23:46.730
This is the outcome.
Two,
um,
the doctor,

339
00:23:46.910 --> 00:23:50.090
Nick's father is congratulating himself,
um,
you know,

340
00:23:50.091 --> 00:23:53.050
that he's performed the operation.
Uh,
he's able to do this,

341
00:23:53.051 --> 00:23:54.670
this area and was just a jackknife on.

342
00:23:54.710 --> 00:23:56.780
He's going to write it up for the medical journals.
It's very,

343
00:23:56.781 --> 00:24:00.020
very happy as a doctor.
Uh,
he feels very much a therm.

344
00:24:00.650 --> 00:24:04.520
And then there's one other development.
Um,

345
00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:09.530
he looks at the prow father,
um,
the person who are to be the proud father.

346
00:24:10.050 --> 00:24:10.460
Uh,

347
00:24:10.460 --> 00:24:15.460
he quickly turns away and tells me so we know what the outcome to get.

348
00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:18.530
Um,

349
00:24:18.530 --> 00:24:23.530
what happens when someone who is not insulated by his professional identity?

350
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.440
Um,
it helps mostly subject to the screen.

351
00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.490
His throw hadn't culled from ear to ear.

352
00:24:32.150 --> 00:24:36.640
The blood had stroll down into a pool where this bar set.

353
00:24:37.830 --> 00:24:41.210
So this is very extreme reaction.
Um,

354
00:24:41.510 --> 00:24:46.240
I honestly don't know how common this is that a father,
uh,

355
00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:51.230
we just go to the extreme of taking his own life,
um,

356
00:24:51.410 --> 00:24:55.620
because he can't really take the pain of his wife.
Um,

357
00:24:55.700 --> 00:25:00.700
but it's the opposite model from the Susan Sontag model is not taking pleasure

358
00:25:02.630 --> 00:25:03.800
from the pain of others,

359
00:25:04.190 --> 00:25:07.790
but being completely devastated,

360
00:25:07.791 --> 00:25:12.791
being completely destroyed by the pain of others to such an extent that you want

361
00:25:13.941 --> 00:25:18.320
to take your biological life because you're in the psychic life has been so

362
00:25:18.410 --> 00:25:22.640
devastated by what you cannot bear to go through anymore.

363
00:25:23.150 --> 00:25:25.410
Um,
so this is,
um,

364
00:25:25.580 --> 00:25:29.310
and extreme case of empathy.
Um,

365
00:25:29.330 --> 00:25:34.330
the husband empathizing with the wife feeling the pain of his wife to such a

366
00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:36.230
standard.

367
00:25:36.230 --> 00:25:40.940
It's almost as if the pain is doing more to him than it is actually doing,
um,

368
00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.920
to his wife.
Um,

369
00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:47.630
so this is one way to think about,
um,

370
00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.020
pain,
how natural it is,
uh,

371
00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:55.430
is naturalized because it is,
uh,
has no,
uh,

372
00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:57.550
socio economic explanation to it.

373
00:25:57.620 --> 00:26:02.620
It's just a fact of life that women will give birth and it is a fact of life

374
00:26:03.440 --> 00:26:05.780
that they suffered tremendously when they give birth.

375
00:26:06.380 --> 00:26:11.120
And it's also a fact of life that when they suffer other,

376
00:26:11.630 --> 00:26:14.150
uh,
likely to suffer as well.
Right?

377
00:26:14.151 --> 00:26:19.151
So this is kind of a transitive relation or pain spreading out and becoming more

378
00:26:20.241 --> 00:26:24.470
and more common,
becoming more and more of condition,

379
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.380
the universal condition of life.
Um,

380
00:26:27.410 --> 00:26:32.270
because they basically is no boundary between the pain of one person,
um,

381
00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:35.300
and what someone else is likely to go through.

382
00:26:35.990 --> 00:26:39.980
So we can say that what we see in Indian camp,

383
00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:41.270
um,

384
00:26:41.270 --> 00:26:46.260
yes to some extent a story that gestures in two directions.

385
00:26:46.620 --> 00:26:51.620
On the one hand there's a lot of interests and the tension between native

386
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.350
Americans and um,
Anglo Americans.
Um,

387
00:26:55.410 --> 00:26:58.800
that's not unimportant.
It pulls in one direction.

388
00:26:59.730 --> 00:27:03.700
It also pulls in another direction and they put in the other direction other,

389
00:27:03.701 --> 00:27:06.780
the micro register in terms of pain.
Um,

390
00:27:06.810 --> 00:27:11.810
that really the most fundamental drama is almost regardless of the relation,

391
00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:16.830
the train Anglos and native Americans,

392
00:27:17.610 --> 00:27:21.960
you do it to everyone and you do it every time you go through pain.

393
00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:26.700
Every time you go into labor,
the son,
this is going to happen.

394
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:31.590
Um,
so it was kind of a naturalization the pain as a kind of universal condition.

395
00:27:32.250 --> 00:27:36.090
Um,
let's look at the intern chapter,
um,

396
00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:38.190
and test this possibility.

397
00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:43.640
Whether or not Hemingway is really wanting to explore the phenomenon that does

398
00:27:47.341 --> 00:27:49.650
nothing to be done about pain,

399
00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:53.070
that it is the most fundamental fact of life,

400
00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.350
that it is as natural as the sense of hearing.

401
00:27:58.830 --> 00:28:02.910
Um,
I think that in Indian county,
um,
this sense that,
you know,

402
00:28:02.911 --> 00:28:05.580
just as we can help the fact that we have pair of ears,

403
00:28:05.850 --> 00:28:10.620
we can help the fact that we're going to be vulnerable to the sounds of pain may

404
00:28:10.621 --> 00:28:12.000
by others.
Um,

405
00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:17.060
in terms of to Hemingway is I'm testing this possibility,

406
00:28:17.670 --> 00:28:22.670
but the same kind of play between the macro and the micro register.

407
00:28:24.870 --> 00:28:25.260
Um,

408
00:28:25.260 --> 00:28:30.260
so the macro register is the Glencoe Turkish ward.

409
00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:33.000
We've really looked at last time.
Um,

410
00:28:33.390 --> 00:28:38.370
and this is about the evacuation of the Greek Civil Orleans,
uh,

411
00:28:38.520 --> 00:28:42.940
when the Turkish army,
um,
was just advancing on them.
Um,

412
00:28:42.990 --> 00:28:47.730
so it's the largest possible contacts,
um,
kind of,
um,

413
00:28:48.630 --> 00:28:53.010
large scale geopolitical warfare.
That's the macro context.

414
00:28:53.610 --> 00:28:57.630
Um,
but it's interesting that in this one fridge,
one paragraph,
um,

415
00:28:57.710 --> 00:29:02.700
Hemingway has transition to something else.
So let's just read this paragraph.

416
00:29:03.330 --> 00:29:06.780
A green Camry hooded along the procession.

417
00:29:07.260 --> 00:29:11.580
Women and kids were in the cause.
Crowds of mattresses,

418
00:29:11.970 --> 00:29:15.380
mirrors,
sewing machines,
bundles.

419
00:29:16.290 --> 00:29:21.290
There was a woman having a kid with a young girl holding a blended over her and

420
00:29:23.221 --> 00:29:26.760
crying scares,
like looking at it,

421
00:29:27.450 --> 00:29:30.480
it rain all through the evacuation.
Okay.

422
00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:34.890
So obviously this is classic anyway,

423
00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:40.370
about as much as bad into this one short paragraph as could be pat into any

424
00:29:41.681 --> 00:29:46.210
short paragraph,
uh,
beginning with the macro context,

425
00:29:46.470 --> 00:29:50.410
um,
of the Iraqi oil,
the evacuation of Greek civilians.

426
00:29:50.890 --> 00:29:51.723
Um,

427
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:57.150
we move on to something that clearly is picking up on the theme La Residues from

428
00:29:57.671 --> 00:30:02.050
the first story from Indian camp,
a woman having a baby.

429
00:30:02.590 --> 00:30:06.280
Um,
and it follows the same structure as well,

430
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:11.200
not just a woman having a baby,
but someone watching that,
observing that,

431
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:13.230
um,
and um,

432
00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:17.740
being terrified of that side of life.
Right?

433
00:30:18.310 --> 00:30:22.510
So we
no mother,
you know,

434
00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:27.460
even though we do know that Indian camp was published separately,

435
00:30:28.120 --> 00:30:31.910
I think that we have to ran Hemingway.

436
00:30:31.990 --> 00:30:36.990
The truth of his statement that the stories and the into chapters have really

437
00:30:38.050 --> 00:30:41.980
connected.
I mean the connected after the fact in the chapters,

438
00:30:42.180 --> 00:30:46.810
at least this particular one is obviously written,
um,

439
00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:51.870
as a continuation of a meditation on the pain of childbirth.

440
00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:53.170
Um,

441
00:30:53.170 --> 00:30:57.760
and not just the pain of childbirth as experienced by the person who is going

442
00:30:57.761 --> 00:31:02.320
that through that phenomenon going through the experience,
but also as

443
00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.630
an observational painting,
um,

444
00:31:08.100 --> 00:31:12.460
in someone who's just on looker.
Well,
it does to the onlooker.

445
00:31:13.030 --> 00:31:17.590
Um,
it's the same kind of dynamics being terrified,
being scared,

446
00:31:17.620 --> 00:31:19.420
sync,
looking at there.

447
00:31:19.510 --> 00:31:24.510
So it's not quite as extreme as the husband calling his own throat,

448
00:31:25.480 --> 00:31:27.360
but being scared,
safe looking.

449
00:31:27.490 --> 00:31:31.930
I will say that is fairly extreme response as well,

450
00:31:32.320 --> 00:31:34.750
um,
to the phenomenon of childbirth.

451
00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:39.250
So Hemingway's obviously interested in people being homeless,

452
00:31:39.670 --> 00:31:44.670
being unable to protect themselves when they're face with the injury of others.

453
00:31:46.830 --> 00:31:50.680
Um,
is the lack of protective insulation.

454
00:31:51.250 --> 00:31:56.250
That is the phenomenon that Hemingway is interested in is why is it that only a

455
00:31:57.701 --> 00:32:02.050
few people,
only people were professional credentials,
like the uppers,

456
00:32:02.590 --> 00:32:05.030
um,
are well protected.
Um,

457
00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:09.970
and that loads of those as they tend to be open to injury,

458
00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.530
open to violence from others.
Um,
in,
in,
in a very helpless way.

459
00:32:15.190 --> 00:32:18.910
Um,
and it's because of that basic configuration,

460
00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:20.920
openness to the injury,

461
00:32:20.980 --> 00:32:25.980
openness to the pain of others that Hemingway moves on to the last line of the

462
00:32:27.750 --> 00:32:28.660
spillover vignette.

463
00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.440
It rained all through the evacuation on the face of it.

464
00:32:35.230 --> 00:32:40.230
No connection whatsoever with the proceeded passage.
Right?
You know,

465
00:32:40.231 --> 00:32:43.640
it was just about your documentation.
Um,
all of a sudden this,

466
00:32:43.641 --> 00:32:45.920
this detail about reigning,

467
00:32:48.230 --> 00:32:51.170
the only connection that I can think of,

468
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.450
and it's a conjecture on my thought,

469
00:32:54.050 --> 00:32:59.050
is that Hemingway has so far been talking about human phenomena,

470
00:33:00.440 --> 00:33:04.430
right?
War.
It's very much a manmade event.

471
00:33:05.150 --> 00:33:09.620
Childbirth is the human manmade as well.
Uh,

472
00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.490
and uh,
I mean there's natural,
but you know,
human beings have to bring it about,

473
00:33:14.180 --> 00:33:14.870
um,

474
00:33:14.870 --> 00:33:19.870
rain is truly a natural phenomenon that is without human input,

475
00:33:21.680 --> 00:33:23.210
without human agency.

476
00:33:23.750 --> 00:33:28.750
So what we see in this little vignette is a movement in the direction of

477
00:33:31.370 --> 00:33:35.900
naturalization.
Uh,
by the time we get to the end of the Vignette,

478
00:33:36.290 --> 00:33:41.290
we get a completely natural process without human input about which human beings

479
00:33:44.091 --> 00:33:48.080
can do nothing,
right?
And this is the resting point.

480
00:33:48.081 --> 00:33:53.081
This is the place that Hemingway wants us to get to a place where we are just

481
00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:59.120
passive recipients of something that is coming to us.

482
00:33:59.450 --> 00:34:01.820
Rain is something that just happens to us.
You know,

483
00:34:01.821 --> 00:34:04.100
we just know that we know this.
We've just been through this.

484
00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:08.090
Rain is something that happens to us.
We are passive recipients.

485
00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.670
Something that happens to us,

486
00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:16.240
the pain of others is natural in exactly the same way.

487
00:34:16.760 --> 00:34:21.760
And we're also a passive recipients of the pain of others in the same way that

488
00:34:22.851 --> 00:34:26.970
we are passive recipients of rain.
Um,
there,

489
00:34:27.020 --> 00:34:31.100
there is one experiential register,
um,

490
00:34:31.310 --> 00:34:33.930
that is very,
very human,
um,

491
00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:38.840
that is almost independent of human agency.

492
00:34:39.350 --> 00:34:41.090
Um,
it is uh,

493
00:34:41.270 --> 00:34:46.010
an experience simply the fine by us as recipients,

494
00:34:46.011 --> 00:34:50.960
as people who just stand there and things being visited upon us.

495
00:34:51.320 --> 00:34:55.970
Um,
so this is um,
I think very much an affirmation.

496
00:34:56.250 --> 00:35:01.250
A of the line of thinking already started in Indian camp is that no matter how

497
00:35:03.950 --> 00:35:07.280
well protected we think we are,
um,
and the weather,

498
00:35:07.281 --> 00:35:11.840
how good we are actually as what we set out to do.

499
00:35:11.841 --> 00:35:15.520
And the doctor obviously is a great doc,
very,
very good offer.
Um,

500
00:35:15.650 --> 00:35:20.180
no matter how good we are at what we set out to do,

501
00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:25.160
um,
there is a limit to what that can accomplish in the world.

502
00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.630
And expertise.

503
00:35:26.631 --> 00:35:31.340
The professional expertise of the Darfur is always going to run up against the

504
00:35:31.341 --> 00:35:36.110
kinds of natural limit and pain of childbirth is in fact that natural than it.

505
00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:40.170
So,
um,
very much a concession,
um,

506
00:35:40.230 --> 00:35:43.590
in the direction of the naturalists of pain,
um,

507
00:35:43.650 --> 00:35:48.650
and the kind of unavoidable intensity and unavoidable violence that they can do

508
00:35:49.381 --> 00:35:53.640
to other people.
So let's look at,
um,

509
00:35:54.150 --> 00:35:58.890
this,
this is basically just repeating summary.
Well,
I just,
that,
um,

510
00:35:58.920 --> 00:36:00.810
let's look at,
uh,

511
00:36:01.470 --> 00:36:06.450
move on to the doctor as after they want to go back and think about this.
Uh,

512
00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:10.560
let's move on to the author and the doctor's wife.
Uh,

513
00:36:10.650 --> 00:36:14.530
and this one isn't on the face of it.

514
00:36:14.531 --> 00:36:18.000
It really isn't so much about pain,
right?
It's not,
Oh,
if,

515
00:36:18.150 --> 00:36:22.200
unless we think about guilt or shame as a kind of pain,

516
00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:26.820
but there's nothing like extreme,
uh,
kind of,
um,

517
00:36:27.270 --> 00:36:31.430
mind numbing mind destroying pain that we see,
uh,

518
00:36:31.431 --> 00:36:34.950
in Indian camp.
Um,
so,
uh,

519
00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:37.440
it is about the tensions,

520
00:36:37.450 --> 00:36:40.540
the between Anglos and native Americans.
So,
you know,

521
00:36:40.610 --> 00:36:44.430
we're back to the macro level about the color farm,

522
00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:50.660
socio economic,
uh,
tension between two Avnet groups,
um,

523
00:36:50.760 --> 00:36:55.350
and attention has to do with the locks that wash assurer,
um,

524
00:36:55.890 --> 00:37:00.630
that really belonged to the logging company.
Um,
that next father,
um,
claims,

525
00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.040
uh,
and because they,
as far as he can see,

526
00:37:04.190 --> 00:37:09.090
it's actually true that they belong to nobody.
So he's trying to,
his higher,

527
00:37:09.260 --> 00:37:12.210
um,
the native American,
um,
workers

528
00:37:13.770 --> 00:37:18.320
day laborers are to cut up the wood.
Um,
and,
uh,

529
00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:22.800
he gets into a row with the,
uh,
native American workers.

530
00:37:23.030 --> 00:37:27.390
Uh,
dig Bolton is basically timed in him,
right?
You know,

531
00:37:27.391 --> 00:37:32.220
rubbing it in that those logs are stolen,
that they don't belong to him,

532
00:37:32.570 --> 00:37:34.560
um,
and he's doing something illegal.

533
00:37:34.830 --> 00:37:39.830
So the professional data is getting more and more flustered as this conversation

534
00:37:40.621 --> 00:37:42.330
goes on.
Um,

535
00:37:42.450 --> 00:37:47.310
and it looks like something's going to happen.

536
00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:51.520
Right.
And we know the deck is a very big man.
He's proud of that.

537
00:37:51.521 --> 00:37:53.610
These sort of big man,
he's not afraid of getting into the site.

538
00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:59.330
So the stage is set really for a real inter ethnic.

539
00:38:02.100 --> 00:38:06.960
And um,
this is Ashley.
What I like to say,
um,
as,

540
00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:07.933
uh,

541
00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:12.420
the first step towards the end of the story,

542
00:38:12.450 --> 00:38:15.740
which we know is actually a happy ending.
Um,

543
00:38:15.890 --> 00:38:20.310
the stage is set for the fight to take place.
The fight doesn't take place.

544
00:38:20.790 --> 00:38:25.260
What is it that stops the fight from taking place?

545
00:38:25.261 --> 00:38:30.261
What is it that makes what might have seemed a natural scene of violence from

546
00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:34.650
Ashley being less than agile?
Um,
that is to say preventable.

547
00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:39.610
So preventable violence,
preventable injury.
This is what the story's about.

548
00:38:40.210 --> 00:38:41.380
So,
um,

549
00:38:41.620 --> 00:38:46.620
this is my candidate for the first step in that direction towards the resolution

550
00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:49.820
of violence in the direction of peace,

551
00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:54.770
which is at what Hemingway is praying,
praying for in this,
uh,
in,

552
00:38:54.810 --> 00:38:56.830
in our stories.
Um,

553
00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:00.130
the exact something of jetway addie laugh,

554
00:39:00.750 --> 00:39:03.580
but Billy take sure,
look very serious.

555
00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.480
He did not understand English,
but he has sweat all the time to,

556
00:39:08.490 --> 00:39:09.323
I was going on,

557
00:39:10.030 --> 00:39:14.890
he was fad with only a few hairs on the start,
like a Chinaman.

558
00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.410
He picked up the two canned hoax.

559
00:39:17.950 --> 00:39:22.150
Dicke picked up the access and they already took the salt down from the tree.

560
00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:28.200
They started off and walked up past the cottage and out the back gate into the

561
00:39:28.361 --> 00:39:31.840
woods.
Do left the gate open.

562
00:39:32.800 --> 00:39:36.350
Billy [inaudible] went back and fastened.

563
00:39:37.950 --> 00:39:38.650
Okay.

564
00:39:38.650 --> 00:39:43.650
So I think it's a really fascinating portrait and for a writer who prides

565
00:39:45.331 --> 00:39:48.640
himself on being completely economical,
actually some interesting details.

566
00:39:48.641 --> 00:39:53.470
I can't for the life of me figure out what their point is for,

567
00:39:53.630 --> 00:39:58.450
uh,
comparing Billy tapes show to a Chinaman.
Let's just the interest in data.
So,

568
00:39:58.451 --> 00:39:59.680
you know,
it's something to think about.

569
00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.770
I can offer you an explanation of why that they,
I do them,
uh,

570
00:40:03.900 --> 00:40:08.800
is in there.
Um,
the only possible reason,
um,

571
00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:09.820
is that,
uh,

572
00:40:09.850 --> 00:40:13.990
having where really wants to highlight the fact that because he's not an English

573
00:40:13.991 --> 00:40:16.640
speaker,
um,
therefore,
you know,

574
00:40:16.810 --> 00:40:20.680
this all this is really great to him and I don't,

575
00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:24.640
wouldn't put it past time in which there's resurrection.
The Greeks in this way,

576
00:40:24.850 --> 00:40:27.640
English is Greg [inaudible] shore.
Um,

577
00:40:27.700 --> 00:40:30.250
so it once again,

578
00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:35.280
it looks squarely in the direction of inter ethnic conflict,

579
00:40:35.860 --> 00:40:37.990
um,
and uh,

580
00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:43.660
ranting primacy to that inter ethnic conflict.

581
00:40:44.230 --> 00:40:48.130
Um,
and going so far as to say that,
you know,

582
00:40:48.131 --> 00:40:52.750
that here is someone who really is completely not in the Anglo camp,

583
00:40:52.751 --> 00:40:56.410
not sharing language about not even having that common grant.
Right.

584
00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:58.480
But what is really odd,

585
00:40:58.481 --> 00:41:01.680
and I think that that really is the point in emphasizing the date.

586
00:41:01.750 --> 00:41:04.420
Obviously he's totally fluent in English.
Um,

587
00:41:04.900 --> 00:41:09.340
Billy is not fluent.
The law cannot understand anything.
Um,

588
00:41:09.370 --> 00:41:14.370
but even though he doesn't have language as to share common ground with the

589
00:41:15.701 --> 00:41:16.534
ankles,

590
00:41:16.840 --> 00:41:21.840
he nonetheless knows there's something about the chemistry and the atmosphere of

591
00:41:24.371 --> 00:41:29.371
an incipient fight that people can pick up on even if they don't understand the

592
00:41:33.470 --> 00:41:33.681
right.

593
00:41:33.681 --> 00:41:38.681
So this is still Hemingway going some distance in the direction of naturalizing

594
00:41:40.101 --> 00:41:40.850
conflict.

595
00:41:40.850 --> 00:41:45.850
It is such a natural process that language as an artificial human invention is

596
00:41:46.881 --> 00:41:47.990
not necessary.

597
00:41:48.170 --> 00:41:51.620
It's not necessarily for us to understand that something is about to happen.

598
00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.680
So the fact that Billy is completely,

599
00:41:54.770 --> 00:41:59.770
fully incomprehension of the situation suggest that conflict conflict if it's

600
00:42:01.670 --> 00:42:05.690
very deep and it's so deep that is the kind of a,

601
00:42:05.750 --> 00:42:10.310
we have kind of a primitive apprehension.
Um,
obviously incipients um,

602
00:42:10.430 --> 00:42:13.530
so well there's also interesting,
um,

603
00:42:13.580 --> 00:42:18.580
is that asked the estimate as the native American Indian laborers leave,

604
00:42:19.161 --> 00:42:24.161
they pick up all other tools that could be used as potential weapons,

605
00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:24.530
right?

606
00:42:24.530 --> 00:42:29.530
So they're not using those things yet as weapons of aggression or self defense

607
00:42:34.611 --> 00:42:36.680
or anything like that.
They just still using those as,

608
00:42:36.930 --> 00:42:38.210
as to as they've done the world,

609
00:42:38.480 --> 00:42:42.140
they're going to take those things away still as tooth.

610
00:42:42.710 --> 00:42:47.710
But the fact that David has left the gate open for me suggest that he's also

611
00:42:51.081 --> 00:42:56.000
leaving open the possibility that those,
the Ken hoax,

612
00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:59.330
um,
the saw,
um,

613
00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:04.360
the dose things that right now are serving only as useful tools could also be

614
00:43:07.521 --> 00:43:11.900
used as weapons is leaving open that possibility.
Right?

615
00:43:12.170 --> 00:43:12.981
So,
you know,

616
00:43:12.981 --> 00:43:17.981
and he would be trees Ashley if those tools were to be put to a secondary and

617
00:43:20.210 --> 00:43:22.250
more deadly use.
Um,

618
00:43:22.310 --> 00:43:25.760
what is interesting is that Billy who doesn't understand English but who

619
00:43:25.761 --> 00:43:30.761
completely understands the situation is the one who goes back and fastens the

620
00:43:30.900 --> 00:43:32.030
Kate.
Right?

621
00:43:32.120 --> 00:43:37.120
So this is a very important detail from Hemingway that it is someone who is

622
00:43:38.810 --> 00:43:42.440
really,
has no personal relation,
has no,

623
00:43:43.430 --> 00:43:48.020
you know,
ties really to the Anglos.
He's the one who actually

624
00:43:49.700 --> 00:43:52.130
performs the important task of closing the gate.

625
00:43:52.430 --> 00:43:56.870
So he's one piece maker coming from a very unexpected place.

626
00:43:57.230 --> 00:44:02.230
But the fact that it is Billy who's performing that function suggested there's

627
00:44:02.420 --> 00:44:05.480
almost a counterpoint to the natural violence.

628
00:44:05.690 --> 00:44:09.380
Just as there's a kind of a natural tendency towards violence.

629
00:44:09.590 --> 00:44:14.590
There's also a natural tendency to keeping the peace that both are firmly

630
00:44:16.040 --> 00:44:20.300
embedded in us.
Both I'm primitive in us and primitive by primitive,

631
00:44:20.301 --> 00:44:23.930
I mean very,
very powerful.
The more primitive they are,

632
00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.990
the more DC if they are and more likely they are going to play out.

633
00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:33.160
So being a peacemaker is a very,
um,

634
00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:37.050
deep seated desire really in all of us,
um,

635
00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.000
and being played out in Billy.
And um,
so I'd like to thank,
um,

636
00:44:42.210 --> 00:44:44.560
test another possibility.
Um,

637
00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:48.660
who else is Billy being aligned with?
Um,

638
00:44:48.870 --> 00:44:53.310
if Billy is going,
taking the first step,
uh,
to stop the conflict,

639
00:44:53.740 --> 00:44:56.950
um,
is there anyone else in the story,
um,

640
00:44:57.290 --> 00:45:01.510
that's feeling the work for him?
Is there some put some,
some,

641
00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:03.660
anyone else in the story?
Um,

642
00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:08.130
that actually finishes the task that is began by the way.

643
00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:12.400
Um,
and obviously if we turn to the ending of the story,
uh,

644
00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.650
we see that this a very,
a crucial conversation,
uh,

645
00:45:16.651 --> 00:45:18.570
between the author and the doctors.
Well,

646
00:45:18.571 --> 00:45:22.890
I have two people who are named in the title of the story.
Uh,
deer.

647
00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.760
I don't think,

648
00:45:24.210 --> 00:45:28.780
I really don't think that anyone would really do think like that.
No,

649
00:45:29.460 --> 00:45:33.660
no,
I can't really believe that anyone would do a thing so intensely.

650
00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.220
And the doctors were saying that,
you know,

651
00:45:35.221 --> 00:45:39.270
that Billy is that take is picking up a fight so he wouldn't have to pay the

652
00:45:39.271 --> 00:45:40.760
medical bills after.

653
00:45:40.770 --> 00:45:44.730
This is all intentional on the part of data that doesn't get getting into a

654
00:45:44.731 --> 00:45:48.480
fight with me and that everything would be off between the two of them.

655
00:45:48.570 --> 00:45:53.370
No medical bills to be paid.
Doctor's wife is saying no.
Um,

656
00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:56.460
so she was saying that,
okay.
You know,
that's not likely.
Um,

657
00:45:56.490 --> 00:46:01.490
the doctor stood up and put the shotgun in the corner behind the dresser.

658
00:46:02.580 --> 00:46:06.790
You going out there?
His wife's that I think I'll move.
Who on?

659
00:46:06.900 --> 00:46:09.770
The doctor said you seen neg?

660
00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.290
You tell him his mother wants to see him.

661
00:46:16.110 --> 00:46:18.630
Um,
it's an interesting

662
00:46:20.190 --> 00:46:25.170
thing to say is,
is,
is not surprising for the wife to say,

663
00:46:25.171 --> 00:46:28.560
okay.
You know,
as you'll see our son telling the come in,
um,

664
00:46:28.860 --> 00:46:33.450
except right after she says that and the doctor goes out,
he slams the door.

665
00:46:34.770 --> 00:46:35.460
Um,

666
00:46:35.460 --> 00:46:39.960
and the wife catches her breath as he goes out and slams the door.

667
00:46:41.010 --> 00:46:45.690
So let's think for a moment about the two things that the wife says.

668
00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:50.720
One is that she does that take is picking a fight so that he wouldn't have to

669
00:46:51.421 --> 00:46:52.350
pay the medical bills.

670
00:46:53.100 --> 00:46:58.100
And the other thing that she says is if you see Nate tell him that I wanted to

671
00:46:58.591 --> 00:47:00.540
see him and he should come in to see me.

672
00:47:01.800 --> 00:47:05.940
What is if fact of saying that the doctor says that to nick,

673
00:47:07.170 --> 00:47:11.070
what does mean do think says I want to go with you.

674
00:47:11.130 --> 00:47:14.550
He doesn't want to go in to see his mother.

675
00:47:14.550 --> 00:47:17.010
He doesn't want to go in the house to see his mother.

676
00:47:17.820 --> 00:47:22.560
So if fat of the mother saying,

677
00:47:22.620 --> 00:47:27.620
I want to see nick actually has the effect that is demonstrated in the ending of

678
00:47:30.191 --> 00:47:35.191
the story is that nick is going to go with his father and we can think of a

679
00:47:38.260 --> 00:47:41.350
better companion,

680
00:47:41.880 --> 00:47:46.880
a better too for the mother to use to stop the doctor from getting into a fight

681
00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:53.310
with his native American workers play.

682
00:47:53.680 --> 00:47:56.200
As long as nick is there,

683
00:47:56.650 --> 00:48:00.280
we know that he's never go in together into a fight.

684
00:48:00.850 --> 00:48:05.020
So the way I'm reading the story,
um,
and you know,

685
00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:08.050
honestly a conjectural reading,
um,

686
00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:13.080
but this is the best the doctor's wife can do as a peacemaker is two engine.

687
00:48:15.591 --> 00:48:20.591
The scenario in which a fight is highly unlikely to take place and it turns out

688
00:48:22.901 --> 00:48:27.901
as she is an asset and engineering that scenario by telling them to come in to

689
00:48:30.131 --> 00:48:30.964
see her,

690
00:48:31.040 --> 00:48:36.040
she was succeeded in exactly achieving the outcome of the story.

691
00:48:37.360 --> 00:48:42.130
Nick going off with his father to see the black squirrels,
no violence happening.

692
00:48:42.580 --> 00:48:44.620
So we can say that the three,

693
00:48:45.310 --> 00:48:49.510
the two stories and in the chapter that together,

694
00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.410
all three of them

695
00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.810
perform all around the meditation.

696
00:48:56.110 --> 00:48:57.730
On violence and pain.

697
00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:03.490
One pointing the direction of the naturalists of balance and pain.

698
00:49:03.820 --> 00:49:08.820
The other pony in the equal naturalists are peace prevailing,

699
00:49:10.630 --> 00:49:13.810
right?
That it doesn't have to be violence,

700
00:49:13.840 --> 00:49:18.730
doesn't have to be pained.
Others paying for oneself doesn't have to be.

701
00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:23.230
It could be stopped.
It can be prevented.
So this is,

702
00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:26.940
I would say this is very typical structure in Hemingway,
um,

703
00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:32.160
is to give us both meditation on both sides of the spectrum.

704
00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.860
Um,
testing both,
both possibilities and,
um,

705
00:49:35.950 --> 00:49:40.870
allowing the three to be in dialogue.
So,
you know,
as far as I can see,

706
00:49:40.871 --> 00:49:44.440
I think the Hemingway is right,
that everything,
in fact,
hands on everything else.

707
00:49:44.710 --> 00:49:49.090
Um,
and we really should see them in relation to one another.

708
00:49:49.210 --> 00:49:51.490
So we'll come back on Thursday and we'll try it.

709
00:49:51.491 --> 00:49:53.380
Another way of clustering the stories.
