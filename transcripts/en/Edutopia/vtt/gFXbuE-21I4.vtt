00:00:09.066 --> 00:00:10.376
&gt;&gt;A fraction with the
same number on the top

00:00:10.376 --> 00:00:12.896
and bottom is a unit fraction.

00:00:12.946 --> 00:00:14.406
&gt;&gt;Narrator: At Forest
Lake Elementary,

00:00:14.406 --> 00:00:16.666
students are assessed
early and often.

00:00:17.066 --> 00:00:19.946
&gt;&gt;Two nights plus three
nights plus one night.

00:00:20.266 --> 00:00:21.836
&gt;&gt;Narrator: Some of
the tests are fun,

00:00:21.836 --> 00:00:24.056
and most of them employ
the latest technology.

00:00:24.196 --> 00:00:25.366
&gt;&gt;Would someone like
to share what they put?

00:00:25.366 --> 00:00:30.626
&gt;&gt;I put A because I added
one plus two plus three.

00:00:31.346 --> 00:00:33.976
&gt;&gt;Narrator: The goal is to
find out where each student is

00:00:33.976 --> 00:00:36.396
and then devise an
individual learning strategy

00:00:36.766 --> 00:00:39.136
that will help them
get to the next level.

00:00:39.206 --> 00:00:40.786
&gt;&gt;Good. Get that in there.

00:00:40.786 --> 00:00:42.326
&gt;&gt;I don't think there's
a school in the world

00:00:42.326 --> 00:00:45.856
where you have a regular classroom
where everyone is exactly the same.

00:00:46.236 --> 00:00:48.576
I think many, many years
ago, students who were

00:00:48.576 --> 00:00:51.676
in teacher education programs learned
how to kinda teach down the middle

00:00:51.676 --> 00:00:53.096
and do a little here
and a little there.

00:00:53.096 --> 00:00:55.936
Well, we know that that's not
right for children, and there's no

00:00:55.936 --> 00:00:58.186
such thing as a regular classroom.

00:00:58.186 --> 00:01:01.966
Our school is a microcosm of
the world, so we work very hard

00:01:01.966 --> 00:01:03.926
to make sure that we
know where children are.

00:01:04.296 --> 00:01:06.926
We don't take time to teach
things that they already know.

00:01:07.136 --> 00:01:10.356
We try to go where they are
and take them as far as we can.

00:01:10.356 --> 00:01:12.166
&gt;&gt;And measure the different level?

00:01:12.526 --> 00:01:14.776
&gt;&gt;Oh, we learned something
a little bit different.

00:01:14.776 --> 00:01:18.196
&gt;&gt;At the beginning of the year,
we do a variety of assessments.

00:01:18.296 --> 00:01:21.696
We have our MAT testing, which
is a computerized assessment,

00:01:22.016 --> 00:01:25.666
and it gives us feedback as far
as different literary strands

00:01:25.666 --> 00:01:27.056
and mathematical strands.

00:01:27.056 --> 00:01:31.076
And it breaks it down for each child
to let us know what range they're in

00:01:31.346 --> 00:01:32.986
and how we can better group them,

00:01:32.986 --> 00:01:35.306
or how we could better teach
them within those groups.

00:01:35.636 --> 00:01:40.006
&gt;&gt;I decide I want to be a police
officer the two officers came

00:01:40.006 --> 00:01:40.636
to our school.

00:01:40.976 --> 00:01:46.096
&gt;&gt;We also have Palm Pilots where
we sit one on one with the child

00:01:46.256 --> 00:01:48.086
and we assess their
reading abilities.

00:01:48.176 --> 00:01:51.466
And so you really get a very
good educational profile

00:01:51.716 --> 00:01:53.626
of that student based
on all of this data.

00:01:53.626 --> 00:01:56.246
&gt;&gt;They go whenever there is a
problem, and they try to help--

00:01:56.246 --> 00:01:59.556
&gt;&gt;Tamika: A lot of times, I'll just
pull out my information that I have

00:01:59.556 --> 00:02:02.256
on each student and I'll say,
"Okay, how can I group them

00:02:02.256 --> 00:02:05.166
to better serve them for
this particular skill?"

00:02:05.166 --> 00:02:07.556
So the groups are fluid
and it's all based

00:02:07.556 --> 00:02:10.246
on how we can meet educational needs.

00:02:10.506 --> 00:02:13.936
&gt;&gt;A person who's advanced
to detect a crime.

00:02:14.016 --> 00:02:14.596
Detective.

00:02:14.596 --> 00:02:16.666
&gt;&gt;Tamika: We have a
group at the smart board.

00:02:16.996 --> 00:02:20.086
What they're doing now is, they're
working on their vocabulary.

00:02:20.186 --> 00:02:21.936
There's also spelling
practice on there,

00:02:22.136 --> 00:02:24.196
and I also include skills practice.

00:02:24.266 --> 00:02:25.806
&gt;&gt;Who's on this computer?

00:02:25.806 --> 00:02:27.346
&gt;&gt;Tamika: Here at the tech zone,

00:02:27.496 --> 00:02:30.056
they're having a blackboard
discussion.

00:02:30.696 --> 00:02:34.396
We've been studying the genre of
fantasy and I was able to look

00:02:34.396 --> 00:02:36.976
at those that were
stronger in literary text

00:02:36.976 --> 00:02:42.426
and have them actually convert a non
fiction text into a fantasy text,

00:02:42.426 --> 00:02:44.156
by changing the different elements.

00:02:44.226 --> 00:02:47.066
Those that were a little weaker,
I actually had them come in

00:02:47.066 --> 00:02:48.486
and comment on the edits.

00:02:49.046 --> 00:02:50.076
&gt;&gt;Kevin: Then that's
when you're ready

00:02:50.076 --> 00:02:51.706
to actually start filming, okay?

00:02:51.926 --> 00:02:53.856
&gt;&gt;Narrator: In his
fourth grade classroom,

00:02:54.046 --> 00:02:58.726
a one to one computer student ratio
helps Kevin Durden individualize the

00:02:58.726 --> 00:03:03.146
study of math, science,
language arts and social studies.

00:03:03.766 --> 00:03:04.406
&gt;&gt;Martha Washington.

00:03:05.116 --> 00:03:05.596
There she is.

00:03:06.106 --> 00:03:10.656
&gt;&gt;We use a model for teaching called
IPAC, which is individualized,

00:03:10.656 --> 00:03:13.016
personalized, authentic
and collaborative learning.

00:03:13.596 --> 00:03:15.956
It's personalized, in that
everybody's showing their learning

00:03:15.956 --> 00:03:18.516
in a way that is comfortable to them.

00:03:19.016 --> 00:03:22.486
They're learning the subject
matter that we assign,

00:03:22.746 --> 00:03:24.856
but they're expressing
it in different ways.

00:03:24.856 --> 00:03:29.296
&gt;&gt;I'm creating a battle on the game
called Medieval Two and we have

00:03:29.336 --> 00:03:32.666
to research what kind
of people they had there

00:03:33.306 --> 00:03:35.726
and like the terrain
of the land and stuff.

00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:39.036
&gt;&gt;Kevin: It's authentic in that
at the end of the projects,

00:03:39.036 --> 00:03:40.476
they'll be sharing them
with their classmates.

00:03:40.476 --> 00:03:43.686
And it's collaborative in that
the students that are working

00:03:43.686 --> 00:03:46.556
on similar projects will help
each other when they learn how

00:03:46.556 --> 00:03:49.246
to use new technology
tools or new software.

00:03:49.606 --> 00:03:51.576
Or alternatively, for
example, for the students

00:03:51.576 --> 00:03:52.466
that are doing the skits,

00:03:52.936 --> 00:03:55.156
they're actually working
collaboratively right now

00:03:55.156 --> 00:03:56.246
in order to create scripts.

00:03:56.246 --> 00:03:56.496
&gt;&gt;Yes, please.

00:03:56.586 --> 00:03:57.306
What a lovely home.

00:03:57.306 --> 00:03:59.586
I hope you don't mind, but I
brought my daughter, Abigail.

00:03:59.736 --> 00:04:03.576
&gt;&gt;Kevin: We're able to use a variety
of different software in order

00:04:03.576 --> 00:04:04.976
for students to present
their learning.

00:04:04.976 --> 00:04:08.746
For example, this young gentleman
here used software called Comic Life.

00:04:09.016 --> 00:04:11.276
And so he's got his
picture of Australia there

00:04:11.276 --> 00:04:14.146
and he's got a bearded
dragon emerging from an egg,

00:04:14.146 --> 00:04:17.016
so that he can talk about that
part of the reptile life cycle.

00:04:17.356 --> 00:04:19.746
And he says that the bearded
dragon is an herbivore,

00:04:20.486 --> 00:04:23.256
and that is something that I
would not have gotten out of him

00:04:23.256 --> 00:04:24.996
if I'd asked him to do
three paragraph essay.

00:04:24.996 --> 00:04:27.556
He'd have sat there, and he'd
have spun around in the chair

00:04:27.556 --> 00:04:30.446
and he'd have tapped his pencil and
he'd have balled up several pieces

00:04:30.446 --> 00:04:33.686
of paper before I got
anything out of him.

00:04:33.686 --> 00:04:36.946
But as it is, with Comic Life, he's
dragging and dropping the photos

00:04:36.946 --> 00:04:39.926
in there and then he's only gonna
write his little thought bubbles.

00:04:39.926 --> 00:04:43.786
And so the graphic scaffold his
ability to use the language.

00:04:44.396 --> 00:04:47.046
&gt;&gt;Sandra: Gavin and Andy,
I'm gonna let you start

00:04:47.046 --> 00:04:49.316
at the little tech zone
right over here, okay?

00:04:49.736 --> 00:04:53.046
&gt;&gt;Narrator: During the research phase
of a project, students are placed

00:04:53.046 --> 00:04:54.916
at various stations
in the media center

00:04:54.916 --> 00:04:57.706
to best accommodate their
individual learning styles.

00:04:58.136 --> 00:05:00.946
&gt;&gt;Don't forget to look in the
reference books, along with the--

00:05:00.946 --> 00:05:04.266
&gt;&gt;We have three stations set up,
because this will hit a variety

00:05:04.266 --> 00:05:06.996
of learning styles for all
the students that we teach.

00:05:06.996 --> 00:05:08.976
&gt;&gt;Do you wanna use the pointer and
make it go up a little bit more?

00:05:09.226 --> 00:05:12.226
&gt;&gt;I'm constantly observing
the students.

00:05:12.336 --> 00:05:16.016
And of course, we do occasionally
give paper and pencil test as well,

00:05:16.016 --> 00:05:18.916
but so much of our assessment
is done through observation

00:05:18.916 --> 00:05:23.346
or through checklist, anecdotal
records, journaling in the computer,

00:05:23.446 --> 00:05:24.916
keeping records on each student.

00:05:24.916 --> 00:05:27.736
And we know which learning
style that each student has

00:05:27.736 --> 00:05:30.026
and we know how they
would learn best.

00:05:30.266 --> 00:05:31.806
&gt;&gt;Isn't it a lot of
work on your part?

00:05:32.006 --> 00:05:34.536
&gt;&gt;Oh, of course, it's a lot of work,
but that's what we're here for.

00:05:34.536 --> 00:05:37.686
We want to help each and every
student that we teach and we feel

00:05:37.686 --> 00:05:40.866
like we're just making a huge
difference in each child's life.

00:05:41.076 --> 00:05:44.996
&gt;&gt;There shouldn't be a comma right
there, but there should be a comma.

00:05:44.996 --> 00:05:46.016
&gt;&gt;Riley, air high five.

00:05:46.016 --> 00:05:47.296
Awesome. Let's keep going, friends.

00:05:47.296 --> 00:05:49.936
