be clear that this is a question that
you're much more likely to hear from a

00:13:43.519 --> 00:13:43.529
you're much more likely to hear from a
 

00:13:43.529 --> 00:13:46.009
you're much more likely to hear from a
community organizer then you want from

you recall that I said that there was a

00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:51.690
you recall that I said that there was a
 

00:13:51.690 --> 00:13:53.600
you recall that I said that there was a
time in my life when I was heavily

00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:53.610
time in my life when I was heavily
 

00:13:53.610 --> 00:13:55.519
time in my life when I was heavily
engaged in civil rights movement what I

00:13:55.519 --> 00:13:55.529
engaged in civil rights movement what I
 

00:13:55.529 --> 00:13:57.920
engaged in civil rights movement what I
did in the two and a half years that are

00:13:57.920 --> 00:13:57.930
did in the two and a half years that are
 

00:13:57.930 --> 00:13:59.960
did in the two and a half years that are
worked in Mississippi that it worked as

00:13:59.960 --> 00:13:59.970
worked in Mississippi that it worked as
 

00:13:59.970 --> 00:14:03.650

a community organizer the age of 20 that

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:03.660
a community organizer the age of 20 that
 

00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:06.319
a community organizer the age of 20 that
was probably to this day one of the most

00:14:06.319 --> 00:14:06.329
was probably to this day one of the most
 

00:14:06.329 --> 00:14:08.420
was probably to this day one of the most
successful periods in my life because I

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:08.430
successful periods in my life because I
 

00:14:08.430 --> 00:14:10.670
successful periods in my life because I
really saw a direct relationship between

00:14:10.670 --> 00:14:10.680
really saw a direct relationship between
 

00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:13.850
really saw a direct relationship between
what I did and the impact it had on the

00:14:13.850 --> 00:14:13.860
what I did and the impact it had on the
 

00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:16.160
what I did and the impact it had on the
communities in which I was working and I

00:14:16.160 --> 00:14:16.170
communities in which I was working and I
 

00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.319
communities in which I was working and I
think I've never forgotten never stepped

00:14:18.319 --> 00:14:18.329
think I've never forgotten never stepped
 

00:14:18.329 --> 00:14:20.810
think I've never forgotten never stepped
very far away from the lessons that I

00:14:20.810 --> 00:14:20.820
very far away from the lessons that I
 

00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:22.819
very far away from the lessons that I
think you learn when you're actually in

00:14:22.819 --> 00:14:22.829
think you learn when you're actually in
 

00:14:22.829 --> 00:14:24.650
think you learn when you're actually in
a community and you're trying to get

00:14:24.650 --> 00:14:24.660
a community and you're trying to get
 

00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:27.530
a community and you're trying to get
people to join with you in creating what

00:14:27.530 --> 00:14:27.540
people to join with you in creating what
 

00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:29.870
people to join with you in creating what
sociologists now described as collective

00:14:29.870 --> 00:14:29.880

efficacy that is to say the capacity of

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:32.760
efficacy that is to say the capacity of
 

00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:35.660
efficacy that is to say the capacity of
a group to join together to make

00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:35.670
a group to join together to make
 

00:14:35.670 --> 00:14:37.639
a group to join together to make
decisions about what they're going to do

00:14:37.639 --> 00:14:37.649
decisions about what they're going to do
 

00:14:37.649 --> 00:14:39.259
decisions about what they're going to do
and how they're going to do it and then

00:14:39.259 --> 00:14:39.269
and how they're going to do it and then
 

00:14:39.269 --> 00:14:41.840
and how they're going to do it and then
app on those decisions in a way that

00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:41.850
app on those decisions in a way that
 

00:14:41.850 --> 00:14:45.319
app on those decisions in a way that
brings about a mutually desired set of

00:14:45.319 --> 00:14:45.329
brings about a mutually desired set of
 

00:14:45.329 --> 00:14:50.139
brings about a mutually desired set of
results so what do you learn from the

00:14:50.139 --> 00:14:50.149
results so what do you learn from the
 

00:14:50.149 --> 00:14:53.000
results so what do you learn from the

cause the rules well that's how we're
 

00:24:50.870 --> 00:24:53.290
cause the rules well that's how we're
operating so why are we surprised when

00:24:53.290 --> 00:24:53.300
operating so why are we surprised when
