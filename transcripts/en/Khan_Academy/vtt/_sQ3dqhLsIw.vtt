00:00:01.317 --> 00:00:02.649
- [Voiceover] The perimeter of the figure

00:00:02.649 --> 00:00:04.868
is 24 centimeters.

00:00:04.868 --> 00:00:07.812
What is the length of the missing side?

00:00:07.812 --> 00:00:09.798
So we're told this figure down here

00:00:09.798 --> 00:00:13.139
has a perimeter of 24 centimeters.

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:15.806
The perimeter is 24 centimeters.

00:00:16.948 --> 00:00:19.215
So what that tells us is that the distance

00:00:19.215 --> 00:00:22.882
around the entire outside
is 24 centimeters.

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:28.023
But what we want to know
is what is the length

00:00:28.023 --> 00:00:29.589
of the missing side?

00:00:29.589 --> 00:00:31.272
Well, the missing side
is going to be the side

00:00:31.272 --> 00:00:34.326
we're not told, so it
will be this one here.

00:00:34.326 --> 00:00:36.317
Because we have this question mark.

00:00:36.317 --> 00:00:38.584
It's missing, it is not labeled.

00:00:38.584 --> 00:00:40.430
So we've got to figure out

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:44.542
what number should go on this missing side

00:00:44.542 --> 00:00:48.209
so that the entire
length is 24 centimeters.

00:00:49.589 --> 00:00:51.738
So let's start with what we do know.

00:00:51.738 --> 00:00:54.706
We know that this top length,

00:00:54.706 --> 00:00:58.257
this top side, has a
length of six centimeters,

00:00:58.257 --> 00:01:00.290
plus, going down the left,

00:01:00.290 --> 00:01:03.982
has a length of five more centimeters.

00:01:03.982 --> 00:01:08.117
Plus across the bottom
is four more centimeters.

00:01:08.117 --> 00:01:12.284
And the last known side is
another four centimeters.

00:01:14.402 --> 00:01:18.069
So when we add those
plus this mystery side,

00:01:20.548 --> 00:01:24.006
we should get a perimeter of 24.

00:01:24.006 --> 00:01:26.756
The entire distance, all of this,

00:01:27.861 --> 00:01:30.354
the six, plus the five, plus
the four, plus the four,

00:01:30.354 --> 00:01:33.392
plus this mystery number should get us

00:01:33.392 --> 00:01:35.142
to a perimeter of 24.

00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:39.023
So let's add over here and try
to make it a little simpler

00:01:39.023 --> 00:01:40.799
to find our missing side.

00:01:40.799 --> 00:01:43.415
I can add in any order,
and I love making tens,

00:01:43.415 --> 00:01:46.507
so I'm gonna say six and four is 10.

00:01:46.507 --> 00:01:48.470
10 plus five is 15.

00:01:48.470 --> 00:01:50.479
And 15 plus four more is 19.

00:01:50.479 --> 00:01:54.731
So we know where 19 centimeters
come from on this shape.

00:01:54.731 --> 00:01:58.540
Here's the 19 centimeters
are here outlined in blue.

00:01:58.540 --> 00:02:00.526
So how many more centimeters,

00:02:00.526 --> 00:02:03.609
what length must this missing side be

00:02:04.895 --> 00:02:07.442
to get us a total distance

00:02:07.442 --> 00:02:10.853
around the outside of 24 centimeters.

00:02:10.853 --> 00:02:14.171
We can do that math,
19 plus one more is 20.

00:02:14.171 --> 00:02:17.840
And then plus four more
to 24, so one more to 20,

00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:21.423
and four more, that's
a total of five more.

00:02:22.839 --> 00:02:26.756
So the missing side length
is five centimeters.

00:02:27.816 --> 00:02:31.532
This side right here
must be five centimeters

00:02:31.532 --> 00:02:35.032
in order for the total perimeter to be 24.

00:02:36.531 --> 00:02:38.401
Okay, let's look at one more.

00:02:38.401 --> 00:02:42.373
This time it says that the
perimeter of a rectangle

00:02:42.373 --> 00:02:43.456
is 32 meters.

00:02:44.593 --> 00:02:47.373
And one side is 11 meters.

00:02:47.373 --> 00:02:49.382
What is the length of the missing side?

00:02:49.382 --> 00:02:52.233
So again, we have a missing side.

00:02:52.233 --> 00:02:53.588
So let's visualize this.

00:02:53.588 --> 00:02:56.755
Let's draw ourselves a rectangle here.

00:02:57.817 --> 00:02:59.897
This is what a rectangle looks like.

00:02:59.897 --> 00:03:03.868
And we know that one
side is 11 centimeters,

00:03:03.868 --> 00:03:07.201
so one side is 11, or meters, excuse me.

00:03:08.822 --> 00:03:11.696
And because we know that
this side is 11 meters,

00:03:11.696 --> 00:03:14.570
we also know that this side is 11 meters,

00:03:14.570 --> 00:03:17.023
on a rectangle, opposite sides are equal.

00:03:17.023 --> 00:03:19.313
So those two we know.

00:03:19.313 --> 00:03:22.911
But what we don't know are
this top and the bottom.

00:03:22.911 --> 00:03:24.289
Those are the missing sides.

00:03:24.289 --> 00:03:26.510
So what are those side lengths?

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:30.528
Well, again, we know we have
a perimeter of 32 meters,

00:03:30.528 --> 00:03:34.337
we're told right here
perimeter is 32 meters.

00:03:34.337 --> 00:03:36.837
So, the question is 11 plus 11

00:03:39.828 --> 00:03:42.411
for these two sides, 11 and 11.

00:03:45.972 --> 00:03:47.972
Plus some mystery number

00:03:48.847 --> 00:03:52.071
and then plus that same mystery number

00:03:52.071 --> 00:03:55.249
because these two sides are equal.

00:03:55.249 --> 00:03:58.999
And that has to give us
a total of equals 32.

00:04:04.922 --> 00:04:08.987
Because 32 is the total
distance around the outside.

00:04:08.987 --> 00:04:10.786
So let's add the 11s.

00:04:10.786 --> 00:04:12.203
11 plus 11 is 22.

00:04:13.473 --> 00:04:16.723
So 22 plus how many more gets us to 32?

00:04:20.366 --> 00:04:22.699
Well, 22 plus 10 more is 32,

00:04:25.529 --> 00:04:28.683
but if we label one of these sides as 10,

00:04:28.683 --> 00:04:30.483
then the other one would have to be zero.

00:04:30.483 --> 00:04:33.263
So they have to be equal,
so how can we equally split

00:04:33.263 --> 00:04:36.044
those 10 meters between the two sides?

00:04:36.044 --> 00:04:37.627
Half of 10 is five.

00:04:39.175 --> 00:04:42.175
So these sides are each five meters.

00:04:44.222 --> 00:04:46.348
22, five plus five is ten.

00:04:46.348 --> 00:04:47.765
22 plus 10 is 32.

00:04:49.783 --> 00:04:53.283
So the missing side length is five meters.
