00:00:02.820 --> 00:00:06.660
I want to share the most beautiful equation in math with you, okay

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:12.510
So [actually] this is literally if you search google the most beautiful equation in math. Yeah, you will find it

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:15.600
So this thing I might need to use a little bit of the board

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:20.399
I'll just write this pi we already know what Pi is right. There's another number in math, which is called I

00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:25.500
This is the square root of -1, so somehow I

00:00:26.199 --> 00:00:29.608
Equal to the square root of -1 which you're not allowed to do

00:00:29.609 --> 00:00:32.939
There's no way you can multiply two numbers together and get a negative one

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:37.019
Well there is if you allow what are called complex numbers, or imaginary numbers?

00:00:37.019 --> 00:00:42.269
So that's this I you can multiply those two together you can get even more crazy number, not only something doesn't end

00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:48.359
but it's not even a real number, but there's another number in math also, and that number is called "e" and

00:00:48.969 --> 00:00:52.919
"e" appears on a lot of these scientific calculators, "e" is another number

00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:54.920
which is just like Pi in the sense that it's

00:00:55.239 --> 00:01:02.038
Transcendental doesn't stop anywhere and also there isn't uh... there isn't a very nice way to express what it is. So this one goes by

00:01:02.859 --> 00:01:04.239
2.71828

00:01:04.239 --> 00:01:10.739
And so on actually this number is also quite impressive. it's one eight two eight one eight two eight

00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:13.240
45 90

00:01:13.240 --> 00:01:20.790
45 and more digits Beyond there okay, so a bunch of nice numbers, but this "e" actually comes also somewhere else in Mathematics

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:23.669
Even though I told you this doesn't have sent any nicer

00:01:24.130 --> 00:01:29.100
Repeating decimal or even terminating decimal with "e", you can get "e" by saying suppose

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:31.140
I have a box of chocolates with a hundred chocolates

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.489
And I [drop] them all on the ground and I tried to put them all [back] in this is like these nice chocolates

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.860
But everything's different right you can ask like what's the probability that every chocolate went back in the wrong spot

00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:43.889
And that probability becomes very close to 1 over "e"

00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:48.539
That's this and the more chocolates you have the closer it is to this anyway three crazy numbers

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:52.589
It turns out that if you take "e" and raise it to that

00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:01.469
then I can finish the equation with two more numbers like the most basic numbers in Math Are 1 and [0] and

00:02:03.190 --> 00:02:05.190
This is true

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:13.619
So what's going on? Here is I've just put together 3 completely ridiculous numbers and they together make negative 1

00:02:15.129 --> 00:02:19.859
For all of the of the nest that was here because all come back in together right here

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:22.679
And this is this is a this is an avis called Euler's identity

00:02:25.659 --> 00:02:27.659
and

00:02:28.780 --> 00:02:33.720
[it] is actually [the] most beautiful equation in math because it combines all of these different constants together

00:02:34.049 --> 00:02:37.649
There's your [pi] there, but suddenly the pi got joined with all these other ones

00:02:38.079 --> 00:02:44.129
So there's some other other other fun parts here - have you seen this is the shirts with the PI and the [I] the joke

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:47.010
where Pi says

00:02:47.349 --> 00:02:50.819
Get real and I says be rational right there

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.079
They're basically calling each other out

00:02:52.079 --> 00:02:57.749
So I seen those shirts ever since I was in [high] school of like the speech bubble get real be rational

00:02:57.780 --> 00:02:59.780
It's like the pot calling the kettle black

00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:01.239
but

00:03:01.239 --> 00:03:04.739
Actually that should that shirt should have one more punch line the last punch line should be

00:03:04.959 --> 00:03:08.039
Let me let me write the joke first this one says get real

00:03:09.519 --> 00:03:11.939
And this one says be rational

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:21.680
the correct way to put the punchline on this joke is "e" should say join me and

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.760
and we'll be

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:28.440
one

00:03:29.769 --> 00:03:31.660
so of course that's a

00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:36.809
Negative one right there, but somehow this was this this punchline the joke was never said before and though

00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:40.530
We thought of this joke about two years ago American it we have

00:03:41.709 --> 00:03:43.709
We have already great t-shirts with it
