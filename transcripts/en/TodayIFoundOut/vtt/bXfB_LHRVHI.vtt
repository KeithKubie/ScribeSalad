00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.610
Born in Dresden, Germany in 1877, Carl Tanzler
claimed to have descended from aristocratic

00:00:15.610 --> 00:00:16.610
stock.

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:20.220
Fanciful even as a child, in later years he
recounted a story of being visited in his

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:25.980
youth by a long-dead ancestor, Countess Anna
Constantina von Cosel, who gave him a vision

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:30.009
of a beautiful, dark-haired woman whom she
said was his one, true love.

00:00:30.009 --> 00:00:33.440
As a young man he either forgot the vision,
made the whole story up later in life, or

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.440
decided to settle because in or about 1920
he married a different woman.

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:41.810
Together (although in stages), they immigrated
to the U.S. with their kids and settled in

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:44.649
Zephyrhillis, Florida in 1926.

00:00:44.649 --> 00:00:49.329
Perhaps realizing he couldn’t avoid his
fate, by 1927, Carl had left Zephyrhillis

00:00:49.329 --> 00:00:53.300
(though they didn’t divorce), changed his
name to Carl von Cosel and made a new home

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.339
in Key West, Florida, where he found work
as an x-ray technician at the U.S. Marine

00:00:57.339 --> 00:00:58.339
Hospital.

00:00:58.339 --> 00:01:02.489
A few years later, in 1930, a young, beautiful
dark-haired woman went to the hospital for

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:06.600
treatment of a lung condition that was eventually
diagnosed as tuberculosis.

00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:12.210
As x-rays were required, Maria Elena Milagro
de Hoyos, known as Helen, ran into Carl who

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:17.320
was awestruck – he claimed to have instantly
recognized her as the woman of his childhood

00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:18.320
dream.

00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.840
elanaAlthough it’s not clear if Carl ever
told Helen about his supernatural vision,

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.310
he was soon professing his love for the young
woman and showering her with jewelry and clothing.

00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:29.850
And, as she continued to decline due to her
illness, when he offered to make house calls

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:32.850
to treat her, the help was eagerly accepted.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:37.119
More enthusiastic than educated, however,
Carl’s “remedies” were little more than

00:01:37.119 --> 00:01:40.270
additional x-rays and strange concoctions.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:45.049
Despite his and the actual doctors’ best
efforts, Helen died on October 25, 1931.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:50.110
Carl’s offer to pay for her funeral was
gratefully accepted by her family, and rather

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:54.000
than settling for a simple grave, he had a
sizeable mausoleum built.

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.170
In gratitude, Helen’s mother gave Carl some
of Helen’s hair as a memento – a decision

00:01:58.170 --> 00:01:59.920
the family later regretted.

00:01:59.920 --> 00:02:04.299
tombVisiting her crypt in Key West Cemetery
nearly every night for the next year and a

00:02:04.299 --> 00:02:09.509
half, Carl later claimed that Helen’s spirit
visited him and asked him to get her out of

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:10.509
the tomb.

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.060
Obliging, in April 1933 he crept into the
cemetery (presumably after dark) with a small

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:20.170
wagon and secretly removed her body and took
her back to his home.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:24.470
With the passage of so much time, Dead-Helen
must have been quite a sight.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:28.910
To reverse the effects of time (and decay),
Carl employed a number of techniques, including

00:02:28.910 --> 00:02:33.660
re-attaching her bones with wire and coat
hangers and filling her now deflated torso

00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.260
with rags to get her back to the right proportions.

00:02:36.260 --> 00:02:41.000
Over these structural supports, Carl made
a kind of skin out of silk, wax and plaster

00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.490
of Paris, put glass eyes in her sockets and
fashioned a wig for her from the hair her

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:46.510
mother had given him.

00:02:46.510 --> 00:02:50.520
Carl then dressed her in style, including
jewelry, stockings and gloves.

00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:54.760
To prevent any further decay and disguise
the smell, Carl also employed a fair bit of

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.740
preservatives as well as disinfectants and
perfumes.

00:02:57.740 --> 00:03:01.950
airshipNot content to only be with Dead-Helen,
Carl also hatched a plan to create a plane

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:06.790
to carry her body, as he put it, “high into
the stratosphere, so that radiation from outer

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:11.570
space could penetrate Elena’s tissues and
restore life to her somnolent form.”

00:03:11.570 --> 00:03:15.360
Seven years later, Dead-Helen’s sister,
Florinda, after hearing some strange rumors

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:20.150
of Carl’s extracurricular activities, including
someone spotting through a window Carl dancing

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:24.400
with a life-sized “doll”, arrived at his
home, demanding to see the doll.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:29.090
What she discovered was that it was no effigy
of her sister at all, but the carefully preserved

00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:30.460
remains of Helen.

00:03:30.460 --> 00:03:34.370
The authorities were immediately notified
and Carl was arrested, but as the statute

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:39.220
of limitations for grave robbing had already
ran, the charges were dropped.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.240
Later investigations revealed a bit of Carl
and Dead-Helen’s “life” together, which

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:46.600
included dancing and spending each night lying
in bed together.

00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:51.800
It’s not clear if Carl engaged in necrophilia;
while some researchers claim that a paper

00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:56.460
tube had been inserted in Dead-Helen’s vaginal
cavity, others claim that as this “evidence”

00:03:56.460 --> 00:03:59.710
was only revealed in 1972, it was not credible.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.560
Even if true, this also doesn’t say one
way or the other whether he had intercourse

00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:06.440
with the corpse- a paper-tube being presumably…
uncomfortable…

00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:11.580
corpseMoving on, as if Carl’s desecration
of Helen’s corpse wasn’t enough, after

00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:15.720
the authorities were finished with the body,
Dead-Helen was put on public display in a

00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:19.769
local funeral home – where more than 6,000
people came to gape at her.

00:04:19.769 --> 00:04:25.230
She was finally laid to rest in 1940 in a
secret location and an unmarked grave.

00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.960
Carl was able to keep a death mask he had
made of Helen (or Dead-Helen, it’s not clear)

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:32.970
and he attached this to a life-sized sculpture
he had fashioned in her image.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.660
He returned to Zephyrhillis where his wife
(they had never divorced) apparently helped

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:39.229
to support him, although they lived separately.

00:04:39.229 --> 00:04:44.479
His autobiography, Fantastic Adventures, was
published in 1947, and he became a U.S. citizen

00:04:44.479 --> 00:04:45.759
in 1950.

00:04:45.759 --> 00:04:50.060
Dying at home in 1952, Carl was supposedly
found with his arms wrapped around a Helen

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:51.060
doppelganger.

00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:54.789
However, the accuracy of this report isn’t
clear and accounts from otherwise reputable

00:04:54.789 --> 00:04:59.520
sources further differ as to whether this
was the death-mask-sculpture Helen or if it

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:34.900
was actually Dead-Helen, whom he had secretly
re-acquired somehow.
