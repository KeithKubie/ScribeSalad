1
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:04.840
So when you look at the landscape now,
um,
you,

2
00:00:04.900 --> 00:00:07.440
you're obviously in the running for a shot at the title.

3
00:00:07.441 --> 00:00:11.760
Has anybody give you any indication of what you would have to do to get a shot

4
00:00:11.761 --> 00:00:14.430
at Uzman or to be next in line?

5
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:17.760
<v 1>Well,
the next one is,
is,
uh,
is 80.</v>

6
00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:21.060
Don't even mention his name on your show because I'm not going to make him

7
00:00:21.061 --> 00:00:22.640
famous.
She's a fucking idiot,
you know,

8
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:25.950
but fight this guy and then go for the title.
That's what it is,
homey.

9
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:29.910
So you have to find somebody else.
Yeah.
What is his name?
Ryan with?

10
00:00:30.380 --> 00:00:31.213
<v 2>Oh,</v>

11
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:34.540
<v 1>Dolby.
No,
no,
no,
no.</v>

12
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.170
You don't want to say no,
I was trying to legacy on Edwards.
No,
no,
no.

13
00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:47.260
He's just made that guy famous soup.
You made him famous a couple of weeks ago.

14
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:49.930
I know.
It's Oh sure man.

15
00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.750
Who Shmenn.
Yeah.

16
00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.180
<v 0>Oh,
that's right.
Yeah,</v>

17
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.140
<v 1>you're supposed to fight it.
Penn ask in July fucking doors.
You don't like him?</v>

18
00:01:01.650 --> 00:01:06.630
Not One bit really own being,
not as that was the fight was scheduled.

19
00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.960
Um,
what's,
what's the problem with VAT answering?

20
00:01:11.110 --> 00:01:13.200
He's that new wage,
you know,

21
00:01:13.201 --> 00:01:16.290
and he's like a fucking 40 year old and a science teacher to want in a way.
Yes.

22
00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:20.280
What age?
But he's like,
these new ones do is to just fucking talk.
Like,

23
00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:25.300
just talk and talk and talk about everybody.
Shut the fuck up.
When you,

24
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.540
when,
when somebody sees your in person,
you're not that guy.
And like I said,
I'm,

25
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:34.150
I don't come from this technology world.
I come from like if you,

26
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.470
if you say like,
Yo fucking Joe,
you're fucking idiot,

27
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.320
what are you going to punch me in the face?
Or I better be ready for it.
You know,

28
00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:43.600
I'm just not going around and disrespecting people.

29
00:01:43.600 --> 00:01:46.390
I get taught respect because if not somebody who's gonna make you respect,

30
00:01:46.391 --> 00:01:49.270
you know?
Right.
But these guys nowadays,
they grew up with these little things.

31
00:01:49.780 --> 00:01:53.020
Nigga just say whatever the fuck they want.
Words carry weight.

32
00:01:53.021 --> 00:01:55.600
Especially my kids can read your stupid comments.
You know,

33
00:01:55.601 --> 00:01:59.290
my kids have access to the Internet now.
I just don't like them.
You know,

34
00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:04.000
one incident I remind when could be one the title,
right?
And,
uh,

35
00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:06.820
Ben immediately comes out,
um,
Khabib's Kryptonite,

36
00:02:06.821 --> 00:02:10.100
I would smash him or something like that.
For starters,
you're 70 pounds,

37
00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:14.560
you fucking moron.
He's a 55 pounds in.
You're not even in the UFC.
You know,

38
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:18.790
he's that type of guy and attention whore.
Look at me,
look at me.
I,

39
00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:20.590
I don't even like his fighting style.

40
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:23.560
I like a lot of restaurant style because if that's what you did in your imposing

41
00:02:23.561 --> 00:02:24.460
and when and awesome,

42
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:29.080
but when your sole purpose is just to hug somebody legs as hard as you can,

43
00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.170
and then I,
I don't know what you think about the Ravi fine,

44
00:02:32.171 --> 00:02:33.940
but he didn't win that fight in my eyes.
You know,

45
00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:36.520
we won was not asleep several times.

46
00:02:36.850 --> 00:02:38.290
<v 0>We lost that fight several times.</v>

47
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.680
I thought that rob was asleep for a second and then,
Ooh,

48
00:02:41.681 --> 00:02:44.050
smart showed it to me and then I changed my mind.

49
00:02:44.230 --> 00:02:47.800
And then herb dean came on and talked about and I changed my mind again because

50
00:02:47.801 --> 00:02:51.310
herb dean was saying that what he was concerned with was the way the arm dropped

51
00:02:51.580 --> 00:02:53.290
and that it was a cervical lock.
The,

52
00:02:53.291 --> 00:02:55.540
essentially when you have a bulldog choke it puts,

53
00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.780
puts a some serious leverage on your neck is like,

54
00:02:58.781 --> 00:03:02.890
and he's seen guys go out from that and their whole body goes paralyzed and he

55
00:03:02.891 --> 00:03:06.060
saw a guy,
uh,
where that happened to it and he came back his,

56
00:03:06.070 --> 00:03:08.770
you've got us moving back again.
But for awhile it was pretty fucking scary.

57
00:03:08.771 --> 00:03:11.490
So who's getting choked out?
You know,
by getting his neck pinched,

58
00:03:11.510 --> 00:03:12.700
it was pinching down the nerve.

59
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:16.300
He was worried that that was happening with Robbie said the ways arm dropped.

60
00:03:16.301 --> 00:03:20.080
He goes,
it wasn't normal and he goes at it and he gave me some serious concern.

61
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:20.700
Um,

62
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:24.790
Ben asked her and said that he let go of the choke a little bit when herb came

63
00:03:24.791 --> 00:03:27.250
over to him cause he thought herb is going to stop it cause he thought Robert

64
00:03:27.251 --> 00:03:29.950
was out and he thinks that during that time when he let go,

65
00:03:29.951 --> 00:03:33.850
Robbie came back to life,
which could have happened.
I don't know,

66
00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.450
it's hard for me to say,
but I feel like in herb dean situation,

67
00:03:37.810 --> 00:03:41.110
I think he did the right thing because of the arm dropping.
Was fucking weird.

68
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:45.970
And the arm driving was a little weird.
Yeah,
but he wasn't.

69
00:03:45.971 --> 00:03:50.620
Now,
I never seen nobody to go to seep doing this.
I've seen people go to sleep.

70
00:03:50.621 --> 00:03:53.740
Ashley,
Evan Smith went to sleep with the thumbs up,
thumbs up.

71
00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.560
But here's what the purpose of that made sense.
He goes,

72
00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:59.800
was it the thumbs up because I want a thumbs up.
If someone looks at me,

73
00:03:59.801 --> 00:04:02.080
I want this.
I want this.
It's not,

74
00:04:02.140 --> 00:04:06.880
is your arm down on that position?
He goes,
yeah,
but was it this?

75
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:09.610
Did he do this or it was his arm down.
I don't know.

76
00:04:09.611 --> 00:04:12.760
Only Robbie knows whether or not he was out.
He says he wasn't.

77
00:04:12.820 --> 00:04:17.460
So you have to also say he's in the middle of war.
Right.

78
00:04:17.620 --> 00:04:19.150
So if it's up to me,

79
00:04:19.151 --> 00:04:22.820
I want the Guy To go pee sign with the guy who's defending the choke with,

80
00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.861
you know they did.

81
00:04:23.861 --> 00:04:26.860
That was the other thing that herb said he didn't grab for the choke and he said

82
00:04:26.861 --> 00:04:29.930
the natural defense would be to get,
get his hands on the,

83
00:04:29.931 --> 00:04:32.820
on the hands and try to separate them.
He didn't do that.
He said,

84
00:04:32.821 --> 00:04:34.840
that's Herb's natural defense.
Maybe Robbie,

85
00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:38.080
cause he's seen this guy do it as a fucking thing.
You know,

86
00:04:38.081 --> 00:04:40.480
maybe Romney can be put to sleep from.

87
00:04:40.481 --> 00:04:41.930
They're just guys that are weird like that.

88
00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:44.530
Certain positions they could go three minutes,

89
00:04:44.531 --> 00:04:47.740
you're choking them and then they don't go to sleep.
Maybe Robbie's that guy.

90
00:04:47.770 --> 00:04:50.560
All I know is he wasn't sleeping.
Yeah,
well that's what Robbie said.

91
00:04:50.561 --> 00:04:52.870
Robbie said that he was waiting for Ben to tires,

92
00:04:52.871 --> 00:04:55.860
arms out [inaudible] that's what he said.
He said that he felt the tie,

93
00:04:55.900 --> 00:04:57.670
the squeeze,
the squeeze really tight,
but he's like,

94
00:04:57.671 --> 00:05:01.570
I'll just let him gas his arms out here.
That was his thought.

95
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:03.040
Look,

96
00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:06.400
I mean Michael Kessler said that when Kevin Lee got his back and they stopped

97
00:05:06.401 --> 00:05:07.720
the fight before he went out,
he said,

98
00:05:07.721 --> 00:05:09.940
I let my hands go cause I was concentrating on my neck.

99
00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:14.140
I was just tightening up by neck and trying to to keep my blood flowing.

100
00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:16.750
I think that one was a little different than it was over.
You're naked,
you know?

101
00:05:16.920 --> 00:05:20.500
Yeah.
It was different that you're going to go to ship eventually and that one,

102
00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.330
let a guy go to sleep like that one.

103
00:05:22.331 --> 00:05:25.450
You should let a guy go to sleep and let him.
Yeah,
the thing happens.

104
00:05:25.451 --> 00:05:27.640
You need to just wake them right up.
Hey,
you went to sleep?
No big.

105
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:30.430
Maybe the pee their pants,
whether they went to sleep,
no big deal.

106
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.060
It's certain net cracks.
We were just go,
oh no,

107
00:05:34.061 --> 00:05:36.610
but that one's not going to put you in a weird trend and especially enough from

108
00:05:36.611 --> 00:05:38.130
Ben's Ashman prob.

109
00:05:40.870 --> 00:05:45.870
So your take is on all of this trash talking media hype shit that you see going

110
00:05:48.791 --> 00:05:53.710
on now.
You don't like it?
I don't,
I don't.
I think,
uh,
I fast forward,

111
00:05:53.711 --> 00:05:56.110
it's not like it's distasteful right now to a certain point,

112
00:05:56.380 --> 00:05:57.770
but if you just forward

113
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:01.640
<v 1>to the guys like me when I was 14 years old watching the sport,</v>

114
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:03.500
now you're looking at the dues right now doing it.

115
00:06:03.501 --> 00:06:06.110
You're going to grow up and think,
oh,
I've got to do the same shit.

116
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.720
I just got to fucking talk a shit lot of shit.

117
00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.690
I don't really got to go to the gym that much.
She's got to have a banging,

118
00:06:11.930 --> 00:06:16.850
lit social network account and I'm fucking Golden,
you know?
And we see it,

119
00:06:16.851 --> 00:06:21.620
you know,
a sage Northcutt for example,
you know,
great town and stuff.
But um,

120
00:06:21.621 --> 00:06:24.320
what he was getting paid out.
Did it make sense for a lot of the fighters?

121
00:06:24.321 --> 00:06:27.890
You know,
why,
why was he getting paid so much?
Because of the social media is,

122
00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:31.280
but as he really bringing in those people into the chairs and into the TV,

123
00:06:31.281 --> 00:06:34.250
because you have a lot of lights,
you know,
so the things that I wonder,

124
00:06:34.390 --> 00:06:35.870
not like to disagree with one of them,

125
00:06:35.871 --> 00:06:39.080
but sometimes girls have like tremendous amount of followers,
you know.

126
00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.430
Do those numbers translate to viewers on the TV or,

127
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:47.840
or like butts in seats or any of that?
Like I,
I would like to know,
you know,

128
00:06:47.841 --> 00:06:52.160
and a lot of times when I've asked like people in the UFC and stuff,
they say no,

129
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:55.340
those numbers don't translate.
So what do they get more money?
You know,

130
00:06:55.341 --> 00:06:56.510
I'm not talking about the girls get more money.

131
00:06:56.511 --> 00:06:59.900
You know what I'm talking about guys that have like a social media presence that

132
00:06:59.901 --> 00:07:00.470
are just getting more

133
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:04.910
<v 0>money.
Money.
Just think it's Kinda translate certain amount.
No,
I'm sure it does.</v>

134
00:07:04.911 --> 00:07:08.200
I'm sure it does.
Like guys like Colby Colby is gotta translate.
I mean he's,

135
00:07:08.201 --> 00:07:12.260
he talks so much shit.
He,
you know,
gets people excited about the fights.

136
00:07:13.010 --> 00:07:16.370
There's something to it.
I don't know,
I just,

137
00:07:16.430 --> 00:07:18.350
I appreciate what you're saying though.
And I,
I look,

138
00:07:18.351 --> 00:07:22.430
I appreciate the way one fc handles things cause they concentrate on just

139
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:25.910
fighters being honorable and fighting their best and find the best fighters they

140
00:07:25.911 --> 00:07:29.240
can fight.
And they don't emphasize that shit talking at all.

141
00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:31.670
They emphasize the martial arts aspect of I get it,

142
00:07:31.671 --> 00:07:35.630
me and you don't like each other.
John Jones and DC.
I love it.

143
00:07:35.631 --> 00:07:39.230
Cause you can feel these guys don't like each of you feel it.
Kill each other,

144
00:07:39.231 --> 00:07:43.220
you know.
But to me everybody's doing it.
When Max Holloway fought Dustin,

145
00:07:43.250 --> 00:07:44.090
there was none of that.

146
00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:46.910
There was just two guys who were the best in their weight class.

147
00:07:46.911 --> 00:07:49.850
I mean Max is the best hundred 45 pounds ever.

148
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:53.990
And Dustin Poirier is absolutely one of the best one in 55 pounders alive.

149
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:56.870
And they're going to go after it.
And it was on the floor,
two dogs.

150
00:07:56.871 --> 00:08:00.980
It was beautiful.
It was a parking,
just biting them,
fighting chicken hands,

151
00:08:01.010 --> 00:08:03.020
full respect before and after.

152
00:08:03.140 --> 00:08:06.620
<v 1>Yeah.
And I get a lot of people like they have that,
uh,</v>

153
00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:09.800
I hate using Jim going into the fight,
so they don't want to shake hands.
Like,

154
00:08:09.830 --> 00:08:12.530
fuck you,
I don't like you.
You know?
But when,

155
00:08:12.800 --> 00:08:17.800
when they're giving so much attention to that WWF stuff and pushing you to the

156
00:08:19.041 --> 00:08:20.900
forefront,
that I don't mean it like,
you know,

157
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:23.960
and just to think that the kids watching it are going to be even worse.

158
00:08:23.990 --> 00:08:25.780
They're going to do it to the next power.
You know?
