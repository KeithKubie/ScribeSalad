00:04:05.830 --> 00:04:05.840
being able to have a synchronous way of
 

00:04:05.840 --> 00:04:07.360
being able to have a synchronous way of
doing it so in the past with in-app

00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:07.370
doing it so in the past with in-app
 

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.640
doing it so in the past with in-app
billing version 1 &amp; 2 what would happen

00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:09.650
billing version 1 &amp; 2 what would happen
 

00:04:09.650 --> 00:04:11.380
billing version 1 &amp; 2 what would happen
is you'd send off a purchase request and

00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:11.390
is you'd send off a purchase request and
 

00:04:11.390 --> 00:04:13.780
is you'd send off a purchase request and
it would get back to you at some point

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790
it would get back to you at some point
 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:16.420
it would get back to you at some point
later whereas now it won't return to you

00:04:16.420 --> 00:04:16.430
later whereas now it won't return to you
 

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:18.460
later whereas now it won't return to you
until as soon as you ask for it you get

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:18.470
until as soon as you ask for it you get
 

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:20.409
until as soon as you ask for it you get
a response so you'll basically wait for

00:04:20.409 --> 00:04:20.419
a response so you'll basically wait for
 

00:04:20.419 --> 00:04:23.219
a response so you'll basically wait for
a response so this really simplifies

00:04:23.219 --> 00:04:23.229
a response so this really simplifies
 

00:04:23.229 --> 00:04:27.040
a response so this really simplifies
coding around the API it it makes it a

00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:27.050
coding around the API it it makes it a
 

00:04:27.050 --> 00:04:30.070
coding around the API it it makes it a
lot more reliable as well and you know

00:04:30.070 --> 00:04:30.080
lot more reliable as well and you know
 

00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.159
lot more reliable as well and you know
there's there's a

00:04:31.159 --> 00:04:31.169
there's there's a
 

00:04:31.169 --> 00:04:32.869
there's there's a
ton of new functionality there as well

00:04:32.869 --> 00:04:32.879
ton of new functionality there as well
 

00:04:32.879 --> 00:04:35.659
ton of new functionality there as well
including local caching and something

00:04:35.659 --> 00:04:35.669
including local caching and something
 

00:04:35.669 --> 00:04:37.159
including local caching and something
again developers have been asking for

00:04:37.159 --> 00:04:37.169
again developers have been asking for
 

00:04:37.169 --> 00:04:39.409
again developers have been asking for
which is being able to query for product

00:04:39.409 --> 00:04:39.419
which is being able to query for product
 

00:04:39.419 --> 00:04:41.719
which is being able to query for product
info so now with this API you can

00:04:41.719 --> 00:04:41.729
info so now with this API you can
 

00:04:41.729 --> 00:04:44.540
info so now with this API you can
actually query at runtime to say what

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:44.550
actually query at runtime to say what
 

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:47.450
actually query at runtime to say what
are the in-app purchases available what

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:47.460
are the in-app purchases available what
 

00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:48.589
are the in-app purchases available what
are their prices and what are their

00:04:48.589 --> 00:04:48.599
are their prices and what are their
 

00:04:48.599 --> 00:04:51.230
are their prices and what are their
description so you no longer need to

00:04:51.230 --> 00:04:51.240
description so you no longer need to
 

00:04:51.240 --> 00:04:53.300
description so you no longer need to
hard-code those prices in your app which

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:53.310
hard-code those prices in your app which
 

00:04:53.310 --> 00:04:55.550
hard-code those prices in your app which
is just great news both for developers

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:55.560
is just great news both for developers
 

00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:59.989
is just great news both for developers
but also for users so the the thing

00:04:59.989 --> 00:04:59.999
but also for users so the the thing
 

00:04:59.999 --> 00:05:01.640
but also for users so the the thing
that's missing in in-app billing version

00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:01.650
that's missing in in-app billing version
 

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.260
that's missing in in-app billing version
3 at the moment is subscription but

00:05:03.260 --> 00:05:03.270
3 at the moment is subscription but
 

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:06.499
3 at the moment is subscription but
that's coming very soon and it's you

00:05:06.499 --> 00:05:06.509
that's coming very soon and it's you
 

00:05:06.509 --> 00:05:09.080
that's coming very soon and it's you
know we basically expect developers to

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:09.090
know we basically expect developers to
 

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:11.510
know we basically expect developers to
start using version 3 as soon as

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:11.520
start using version 3 as soon as
 

00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:16.100
start using version 3 as soon as
possible because it really is great so

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:16.110
possible because it really is great so
 

00:05:16.110 --> 00:05:17.749
possible because it really is great so
with that being said I'm now going to

00:05:17.749 --> 00:05:17.759
with that being said I'm now going to
 

00:05:17.759 --> 00:05:21.110
with that being said I'm now going to
hand it over to Tony to talk to us about

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:21.120
hand it over to Tony to talk to us about
 

00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:22.820
hand it over to Tony to talk to us about
the Maps API

00:05:22.820 --> 00:05:22.830
the Maps API
 

00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:29.450
the Maps API
so Tony yeah so before we get into the

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:29.460
so Tony yeah so before we get into the
 

00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.570
so Tony yeah so before we get into the
details let me give a brief introduction

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:32.580
details let me give a brief introduction
 

00:05:32.580 --> 00:05:37.519
details let me give a brief introduction
on how to get started to incorporate the

00:05:37.519 --> 00:05:37.529
on how to get started to incorporate the
 

00:05:37.529 --> 00:05:41.510
on how to get started to incorporate the
new Maps API into your your Android apps

00:05:41.510 --> 00:05:41.520
new Maps API into your your Android apps
 

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.480
new Maps API into your your Android apps
so the first thing you need to have is

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:44.490
so the first thing you need to have is
 

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:48.230
so the first thing you need to have is
of course like are you installing in the

00:05:48.230 --> 00:05:48.240
of course like are you installing in the
 

00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:52.040
of course like are you installing in the
Google Play services this is including

00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:52.050
Google Play services this is including
 

00:05:52.050 --> 00:05:54.740
Google Play services this is including
the part of the Android SDK manager so

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:54.750
the part of the Android SDK manager so
 

00:05:54.750 --> 00:05:58.610
the part of the Android SDK manager so
if you go to eclipse and launch the SDK

00:05:58.610 --> 00:05:58.620
if you go to eclipse and launch the SDK
 

00:05:58.620 --> 00:06:01.850
if you go to eclipse and launch the SDK
manager you will see a new version of

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:01.860
manager you will see a new version of
 

00:06:01.860 --> 00:06:04.730
manager you will see a new version of
Google Play services which is version 2

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740
Google Play services which is version 2
 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.399
Google Play services which is version 2
and and just install it that's the first

00:06:07.399 --> 00:06:07.409
and and just install it that's the first
 

00:06:07.409 --> 00:06:12.320
and and just install it that's the first
step next slide the next thing we need

00:06:12.320 --> 00:06:12.330
step next slide the next thing we need
 

00:06:12.330 --> 00:06:15.920
step next slide the next thing we need
to have is of course just like the first

00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:15.930
to have is of course just like the first
 

00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:18.379
to have is of course just like the first
version you need to have a Google Maps

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:18.389
version you need to have a Google Maps
 

00:06:18.389 --> 00:06:22.339
version you need to have a Google Maps
API key so one thing which which is

00:06:22.339 --> 00:06:22.349
API key so one thing which which is
 

00:06:22.349 --> 00:06:25.189
API key so one thing which which is
really important is the existing key you

00:06:25.189 --> 00:06:25.199
really important is the existing key you
 

00:06:25.199 --> 00:06:28.519
really important is the existing key you
have from if you already have a Maps an

00:06:28.519 --> 00:06:28.529
have from if you already have a Maps an
 

00:06:28.529 --> 00:06:30.409
have from if you already have a Maps an
application using the map view version

00:06:30.409 --> 00:06:30.419
application using the map view version
 

00:06:30.419 --> 00:06:33.529
application using the map view version
one one thing important is the the key

00:06:33.529 --> 00:06:33.539
one one thing important is the the key
 

00:06:33.539 --> 00:06:37.189
one one thing important is the the key
for version 1 is not going to work with

00:06:37.189 --> 00:06:37.199
for version 1 is not going to work with
 

00:06:37.199 --> 00:06:39.800
for version 1 is not going to work with
the version 2 API so you do need to

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:39.810
the version 2 API so you do need to
 

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:43.430
the version 2 API so you do need to
generate a new Maps API key to use the

00:06:43.430 --> 00:06:43.440
generate a new Maps API key to use the
 

00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:45.100
generate a new Maps API key to use the
new version

00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.110
new version
 

00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:49.100
new version
another thing about the API key is it's

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:49.110
another thing about the API key is it's
 

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:54.050
another thing about the API key is it's
generated in Google API console so pay

00:06:54.050 --> 00:06:54.060
generated in Google API console so pay
 

00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:55.640
generated in Google API console so pay
attention that's not the Google Play

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:55.650
attention that's not the Google Play
 

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.429
attention that's not the Google Play
Developer console so I actually includes

00:06:58.429 --> 00:06:58.439

next slide so about the Maps API key the

00:07:37.579 --> 00:07:37.589
next slide so about the Maps API key the
 

00:07:37.589 --> 00:07:41.480
next slide so about the Maps API key the
format is like you you have is the first

00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:41.490
format is like you you have is the first
 

00:07:41.490 --> 00:07:44.360
format is like you you have is the first
part of the if so you need two things to

00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:44.370
part of the if so you need two things to
 

00:07:44.370 --> 00:07:47.719
part of the if so you need two things to
generate the Maps API key the key itself

00:07:47.719 --> 00:07:47.729
generate the Maps API key the key itself
 

00:07:47.729 --> 00:07:52.070
generate the Maps API key the key itself
is a 40 character key but in order to

00:07:52.070 --> 00:07:52.080
is a 40 character key but in order to
 

00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:54.350
is a 40 character key but in order to
generate the key you need to have to two

00:07:54.350 --> 00:07:54.360
generate the key you need to have to two
 

00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.140
generate the key you need to have to two
things one is your apps certificates

00:07:57.140 --> 00:07:57.150
things one is your apps certificates
 

00:07:57.150 --> 00:08:00.740
things one is your apps certificates
sha-1 fingerprint print and the next

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:00.750
sha-1 fingerprint print and the next
 

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:05.269
sha-1 fingerprint print and the next
thing is the package name so so so how

00:08:05.269 --> 00:08:05.279
thing is the package name so so so how
 

00:08:05.279 --> 00:08:08.389
thing is the package name so so so how
to get the the the sha-1 fingerprint so

00:08:08.389 --> 00:08:08.399
to get the the the sha-1 fingerprint so
 

00:08:08.399 --> 00:08:11.029
to get the the the sha-1 fingerprint so
there is you can use the teak the key

00:08:11.029 --> 00:08:11.039
there is you can use the teak the key
 

00:08:11.039 --> 00:08:14.300
there is you can use the teak the key
tool command line I have included

00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:14.310
tool command line I have included
 

00:08:14.310 --> 00:08:17.240
tool command line I have included
command line here but one thing you

00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:17.250
command line here but one thing you
 

00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:19.639
command line here but one thing you
really need to pay attention is you need

00:08:19.639 --> 00:08:19.649
really need to pay attention is you need
 

00:08:19.649 --> 00:08:27.019
really need to pay attention is you need
to use the - - we both are attribute so

00:08:27.019 --> 00:08:27.029
to use the - - we both are attribute so
 

00:08:27.029 --> 00:08:29.420
to use the - - we both are attribute so
that it will show the char on

00:08:29.420 --> 00:08:29.430
that it will show the char on
 

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:31.639
that it will show the char on
fingerprints so one thing is if you

00:08:31.639 --> 00:08:31.649
fingerprints so one thing is if you
 

00:08:31.649 --> 00:08:35.750
fingerprints so one thing is if you
don't include the - we parameter by

00:08:35.750 --> 00:08:35.760
don't include the - we parameter by
 

00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:38.600
don't include the - we parameter by
default the fingerprint shown on the on

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:38.610
default the fingerprint shown on the on
 

00:08:38.610 --> 00:08:41.209
default the fingerprint shown on the on
the result is is going to be md5

00:08:41.209 --> 00:08:41.219
the result is is going to be md5
 

00:08:41.219 --> 00:08:43.430
the result is is going to be md5

exactly like the Xiaolin fingerprint so

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:47.310
exactly like the Xiaolin fingerprint so
 

00:08:47.310 --> 00:08:50.960
exactly like the Xiaolin fingerprint so
we have some developer try to run the

00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:50.970
we have some developer try to run the
 

00:08:50.970 --> 00:08:53.000
we have some developer try to run the
key tools and then they said it couldn't

00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:53.010
key tools and then they said it couldn't
 

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:55.490
key tools and then they said it couldn't
generate the key because it is the wrong

00:08:55.490 --> 00:08:55.500
generate the key because it is the wrong
 

00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:58.400
generate the key because it is the wrong
fingerprint you in in

00:08:58.400 --> 00:08:58.410
fingerprint you in in
 

00:08:58.410 --> 00:09:00.980
fingerprint you in in
case we need the sha-1 fingerprint in

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:00.990
case we need the sha-1 fingerprint in
 

00:09:00.990 --> 00:09:05.300

stuff nb5 one another best practice I

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:05.310

want to share with you is is it's a good

00:09:08.869 --> 00:09:08.879
want to share with you is is it's a good
 

00:09:08.879 --> 00:09:11.090
want to share with you is is it's a good
practice to to use a different

00:09:11.090 --> 00:09:11.100
practice to to use a different
 

00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:14.840
practice to to use a different
certificate to sign each application so

00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:14.850
certificate to sign each application so
 

00:09:14.850 --> 00:09:18.769
certificate to sign each application so
so in this case you you you will use

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:18.779
so in this case you you you will use
 

00:09:18.779 --> 00:09:21.800
so in this case you you you will use
your application certificate to get

00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:21.810
your application certificate to get
 

00:09:21.810 --> 00:09:23.600
your application certificate to get
different the showering fingerprint and

00:09:23.600 --> 00:09:23.610
different the showering fingerprint and
 

00:09:23.610 --> 00:09:31.579
different the showering fingerprint and
then we append the package name after :

00:09:31.579 --> 00:09:31.589
then we append the package name after :
 

00:09:31.589 --> 00:09:35.569
then we append the package name after :
and and you get your generator the right

00:09:35.569 --> 00:09:35.579
and and you get your generator the right
 

00:09:35.579 --> 00:09:41.240
and and you get your generator the right

another thing you need to make sure to

00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:44.850
another thing you need to make sure to
 

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:47.869
another thing you need to make sure to
include in your project is especially if

00:09:47.869 --> 00:09:47.879
include in your project is especially if
 

00:09:47.879 --> 00:09:51.400

you want to target anything earlier than
 

00:09:51.410 --> 00:09:55.850
you want to target anything earlier than
API 11 so in most case I think the

00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:55.860
API 11 so in most case I think the
 

00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:57.949
API 11 so in most case I think the
support library is really important so

00:09:57.949 --> 00:09:57.959
support library is really important so
 

00:09:57.959 --> 00:10:02.090
support library is really important so
the new Maps API also backport to the

00:10:02.090 --> 00:10:02.100
the new Maps API also backport to the
 

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:05.480
the new Maps API also backport to the
support library and you so you need to

00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:05.490
support library and you so you need to
 

00:10:05.490 --> 00:10:08.379
support library and you so you need to
install the latest support library

00:10:08.379 --> 00:10:08.389
install the latest support library
 

00:10:08.389 --> 00:10:12.170
install the latest support library
instead of using the map fragment if you

00:10:12.170 --> 00:10:12.180
instead of using the map fragment if you
 

00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:15.290
instead of using the map fragment if you
use the support library use support map

00:10:15.290 --> 00:10:15.300
use the support library use support map
 

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.280
use the support library use support map

didn't need these permissions so it's

00:12:49.040 --> 00:12:49.050
didn't need these permissions so it's
 

00:12:49.050 --> 00:12:50.509
didn't need these permissions so it's
it's really important that people don't

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:59.030
item in your in your application we make
it even easier for you so there's API

00:13:59.030 --> 00:13:59.040
it even easier for you so there's API
 

00:13:59.040 --> 00:14:02.930
it even easier for you so there's API
call from Google Play services to get

00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:02.940
call from Google Play services to get
 

00:14:02.940 --> 00:14:05.090
call from Google Play services to get
open source software license info so you

00:14:05.090 --> 00:14:05.100
open source software license info so you
 

00:14:05.100 --> 00:14:08.270
open source software license info so you
just need to get that grab that text

00:14:08.270 --> 00:14:08.280
just need to get that grab that text
 

00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.340
just need to get that grab that text
from the from them method and just

00:14:10.340 --> 00:14:10.350
from the from them method and just
 

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.380
from the from them method and just
include that in your in your about as

00:14:12.380 --> 00:14:12.390
include that in your in your about as
 

00:14:12.390 --> 00:14:15.860
include that in your in your about as
action item just also I'm going to add

00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:15.870
action item just also I'm going to add
 

00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.250
action item just also I'm going to add
here that as of the 1st of October

00:14:18.250 --> 00:14:18.260
here that as of the 1st of October
 

00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:23.560
here that as of the 1st of October
90% of Android devices support OpenGL 2

00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:23.570
90% of Android devices support OpenGL 2
 

00:14:23.570 --> 00:14:27.380
90% of Android devices support OpenGL 2
version 2 so anything remotely modern

00:14:27.380 --> 00:14:27.390
version 2 so anything remotely modern
 

00:14:27.390 --> 00:14:29.510
version 2 so anything remotely modern
will definitely do it but in terms of

00:14:29.510 --> 00:14:29.520
will definitely do it but in terms of
 

00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:31.130
will definitely do it but in terms of
all the devices that don't support

00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:31.140
all the devices that don't support
 

00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:34.460
all the devices that don't support
OpenGL version 2 we're talking about 9.2

00:14:34.460 --> 00:14:34.470
OpenGL version 2 we're talking about 9.2
 

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:36.680
OpenGL version 2 we're talking about 9.2
percent so the majority of devices

00:14:36.680 --> 00:14:36.690
percent so the majority of devices
 

00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.440
percent so the majority of devices
definitely will support this it's not

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:39.450
definitely will support this it's not
 

00:14:39.450 --> 00:14:42.170
definitely will support this it's not
such a bad it's not such a hard

00:14:42.170 --> 00:14:42.180
such a bad it's not such a hard
 

00:14:42.180 --> 00:14:45.050
such a bad it's not such a hard
requirement because you definitely get

00:14:45.050 --> 00:14:45.060
requirement because you definitely get
 

00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:47.750
requirement because you definitely get
better maps and the experience on device

00:14:47.750 --> 00:14:47.760
better maps and the experience on device
 

00:14:47.760 --> 00:14:50.410
better maps and the experience on device
this wouldn't be worthwhile anyway so

00:14:50.410 --> 00:14:50.420
this wouldn't be worthwhile anyway so
 

00:14:50.420 --> 00:14:53.750
this wouldn't be worthwhile anyway so
this isn't as stricter requirement as it

00:14:53.750 --> 00:14:53.760
this isn't as stricter requirement as it
 

00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:59.150
this isn't as stricter requirement as it
may seem so that's pretty much all I

00:14:59.150 --> 00:14:59.160
may seem so that's pretty much all I
 

00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:02.540
may seem so that's pretty much all I
have for getting started to have your

00:15:02.540 --> 00:15:02.550
have for getting started to have your
 

00:15:02.550 --> 00:15:05.390
have for getting started to have your
apps to incorporate in maps and our past

00:15:05.390 --> 00:15:05.400
apps to incorporate in maps and our past
 

00:15:05.400 --> 00:15:09.110
apps to incorporate in maps and our past
past positive 40 to you to tell you guys

00:15:09.110 --> 00:15:09.120
past positive 40 to you to tell you guys
 

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:12.020
past positive 40 to you to tell you guys
more details about how to use all the

00:15:12.020 --> 00:15:12.030
more details about how to use all the
 

00:15:12.030 --> 00:15:13.730
more details about how to use all the
features in the in the maps in the new

00:15:13.730 --> 00:15:13.740
features in the in the maps in the new
 

00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:17.210
features in the in the maps in the new
and Maps API oh cool yeah thanks Tony

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:17.220
and Maps API oh cool yeah thanks Tony
 

00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.430
and Maps API oh cool yeah thanks Tony
so so yeah so Tony took you through all

00:15:19.430 --> 00:15:19.440
so so yeah so Tony took you through all
 

00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:23.000
so so yeah so Tony took you through all
the steps to get and kind of prepped for

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.010
the steps to get and kind of prepped for
 

00:15:23.010 --> 00:15:25.310
the steps to get and kind of prepped for
for including a map and now I'll kind of

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:25.320
for including a map and now I'll kind of
 

00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.990
for including a map and now I'll kind of
start off with telling you actually how

00:15:26.990 --> 00:15:27.000
start off with telling you actually how
 

00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:29.660
start off with telling you actually how
to get the map in your application from

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:29.670
to get the map in your application from
 

00:15:29.670 --> 00:15:32.150
to get the map in your application from
the code point of view so so first thing

00:15:32.150 --> 00:15:32.160
the code point of view so so first thing
 

00:15:32.160 --> 00:15:33.620
the code point of view so so first thing
is is you definitely want to set up a

00:15:33.620 --> 00:15:33.630
is is you definitely want to set up a
 

00:15:33.630 --> 00:15:37.220
is is you definitely want to set up a
layout you know to actually hold the map

00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:37.230
layout you know to actually hold the map
 

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:39.230
layout you know to actually hold the map
and that layout actually is

00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:39.240
and that layout actually is
 

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:40.970
and that layout actually is
the layout component is a fragment or

00:15:40.970 --> 00:15:40.980
the layout component is a fragment or
 

00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:43.370
the layout component is a fragment or
you can use a fragment for that so and

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:43.380
you can use a fragment for that so and
 

00:15:43.380 --> 00:15:45.920
you can use a fragment for that so and
then the first sample here we're using

00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:45.930
then the first sample here we're using
 

00:15:45.930 --> 00:15:48.050
then the first sample here we're using
the support map fragment because we're

00:15:48.050 --> 00:15:48.060
the support map fragment because we're
 

00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.390
the support map fragment because we're
using the support library but but you

00:15:50.390 --> 00:15:50.400
using the support library but but you
 

00:15:50.400 --> 00:15:52.430
using the support library but but you
can if you're not using the support

00:15:52.430 --> 00:15:52.440
can if you're not using the support
 

00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:54.680
can if you're not using the support
library which you probably should be

00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:54.690
library which you probably should be
 

00:15:54.690 --> 00:15:56.810
library which you probably should be
using the support library but just leave

00:15:56.810 --> 00:15:56.820
using the support library but just leave
 

00:15:56.820 --> 00:15:59.750
using the support library but just leave
a support out of that the support map

00:15:59.750 --> 00:15:59.760
a support out of that the support map
 

00:15:59.760 --> 00:16:01.910
a support out of that the support map
fragment line there at the end so

00:16:01.910 --> 00:16:01.920
fragment line there at the end so
 

00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.530
fragment line there at the end so
basically if you're supporting devices

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:03.540
basically if you're supporting devices
 

00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:07.430
basically if you're supporting devices
prior to honeycomb Android 3.0 you'll be

00:16:07.430 --> 00:16:07.440
prior to honeycomb Android 3.0 you'll be
 

00:16:07.440 --> 00:16:08.960
prior to honeycomb Android 3.0 you'll be
using the support library because we

00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:08.970
using the support library because we
 

00:16:08.970 --> 00:16:10.460
using the support library because we
didn't have fragments prior to that

00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:10.470
didn't have fragments prior to that
 

00:16:10.470 --> 00:16:12.980
didn't have fragments prior to that
now given that gingerbread which is 2.3

00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:12.990
now given that gingerbread which is 2.3
 

00:16:12.990 --> 00:16:16.100
now given that gingerbread which is 2.3
is still about roughly about 50% of the

00:16:16.100 --> 00:16:16.110
is still about roughly about 50% of the
 

00:16:16.110 --> 00:16:17.990
is still about roughly about 50% of the
user base you you almost definitely will

00:16:17.990 --> 00:16:18.000
user base you you almost definitely will
 

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.840
user base you you almost definitely will
be using the support library so this is

00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:20.850
be using the support library so this is
 

00:16:20.850 --> 00:16:23.720
be using the support library so this is
an important point yeah yeah so what

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:23.730
an important point yeah yeah so what
 

00:16:23.730 --> 00:16:25.730
an important point yeah yeah so what
kind of carry on with you know under the

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:25.740
kind of carry on with you know under the
 

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.900
kind of carry on with you know under the
assumption that you're using the support

00:16:26.900 --> 00:16:26.910
assumption that you're using the support
 

00:16:26.910 --> 00:16:28.850
assumption that you're using the support
map fragment but I mean the code

00:16:28.850 --> 00:16:28.860
map fragment but I mean the code
 

00:16:28.860 --> 00:16:30.560
map fragment but I mean the code
essentially looks exactly the same

00:16:30.560 --> 00:16:30.570
essentially looks exactly the same
 

00:16:30.570 --> 00:16:32.780
essentially looks exactly the same
or different namespaces exactly

00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:32.790
or different namespaces exactly
 

00:16:32.790 --> 00:16:34.040
or different namespaces exactly
different namespaces and slightly

00:16:34.040 --> 00:16:34.050
different namespaces and slightly
 

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:37.330
different namespaces and slightly
different function calls but but yeah

00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:37.340
different function calls but but yeah
 

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.130
different function calls but but yeah
and you can see so so when we're

00:16:40.130 --> 00:16:40.140
and you can see so so when we're
 

00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:42.650
and you can see so so when we're
actually creating our activity you you

00:16:42.650 --> 00:16:42.660
actually creating our activity you you
 

00:16:42.660 --> 00:16:45.170
actually creating our activity you you
using the support library you define it

00:16:45.170 --> 00:16:45.180
using the support library you define it
 

00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.160
using the support library you define it
as a fragment activity and maybe anchor

00:16:49.160 --> 00:16:49.170
as a fragment activity and maybe anchor
 

00:16:49.170 --> 00:16:51.350
as a fragment activity and maybe anchor
what is the the fragment activity why is

00:16:51.350 --> 00:16:51.360
what is the the fragment activity why is
 

00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:53.330
what is the the fragment activity why is
it why isn't it not just called fragment

00:16:53.330 --> 00:16:53.340
it why isn't it not just called fragment
 

00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.370
it why isn't it not just called fragment
or well so in Android 3.0 and upwards

00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:58.380
or well so in Android 3.0 and upwards
 

00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.200
or well so in Android 3.0 and upwards
activities could host fragments now

00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:00.210
activities could host fragments now
 

00:17:00.210 --> 00:17:01.880
activities could host fragments now
fragments are part of the lifecycle as

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:01.890
fragments are part of the lifecycle as
 

00:17:01.890 --> 00:17:05.030
fragments are part of the lifecycle as
well now prior to Android 3.0 you just

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:05.040
well now prior to Android 3.0 you just
 

00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:07.040
well now prior to Android 3.0 you just
had because there were no fragments

00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:07.050
had because there were no fragments
 

00:17:07.050 --> 00:17:08.510
had because there were no fragments
those activities don't support the

00:17:08.510 --> 00:17:08.520
those activities don't support the
 

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.640
those activities don't support the
fragment lifecycle so in the support

00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:10.650
fragment lifecycle so in the support
 

00:17:10.650 --> 00:17:12.260
fragment lifecycle so in the support
library we introduced a fragment

00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:12.270
library we introduced a fragment
 

00:17:12.270 --> 00:17:14.870
library we introduced a fragment
activity which extends activity but it

00:17:14.870 --> 00:17:14.880
activity which extends activity but it
 

00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:17.270
activity which extends activity but it
adds the closing for the fragment life

00:17:17.270 --> 00:17:17.280
adds the closing for the fragment life
 

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.090
adds the closing for the fragment life
cycles and they can host fragments so

00:17:20.090 --> 00:17:20.100
cycles and they can host fragments so
 

00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:21.470
cycles and they can host fragments so
that's why we're using this particular

00:17:21.470 --> 00:17:21.480
that's why we're using this particular
 

00:17:21.480 --> 00:17:23.270
that's why we're using this particular
that's why we're using the fragment

00:17:23.270 --> 00:17:23.280
that's why we're using the fragment
 

00:17:23.280 --> 00:17:26.990
that's why we're using the fragment
activity yeah very cool and yep so from

00:17:26.990 --> 00:17:27.000
activity yeah very cool and yep so from
 

00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:28.520
activity yeah very cool and yep so from
then on out it's just a matter of

00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:28.530
then on out it's just a matter of
 

00:17:28.530 --> 00:17:30.470
then on out it's just a matter of
getting the map in your in your activity

00:17:30.470 --> 00:17:30.480
getting the map in your in your activity
 

00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.250
getting the map in your in your activity
or your fragment so it's a it's called a

00:17:34.250 --> 00:17:34.260
or your fragment so it's a it's called a
 

00:17:34.260 --> 00:17:36.950
or your fragment so it's a it's called a
Google map as the class name and you can

00:17:36.950 --> 00:17:36.960
Google map as the class name and you can
 

00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:38.480
Google map as the class name and you can
see in the oncreate method is actually

00:17:38.480 --> 00:17:38.490
see in the oncreate method is actually
 

00:17:38.490 --> 00:17:40.040
see in the oncreate method is actually
where you're gonna get it up get it out

00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:40.050
where you're gonna get it up get it out
 

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:42.110
where you're gonna get it up get it out
of your layout file I'm just using the

00:17:42.110 --> 00:17:42.120
of your layout file I'm just using the
 

00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:44.030
of your layout file I'm just using the
ID enter the ID that you specified in

00:17:44.030 --> 00:17:44.040
ID enter the ID that you specified in
 

00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:47.480
ID enter the ID that you specified in
your layout so and I should mention so

00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:47.490
your layout so and I should mention so
 

00:17:47.490 --> 00:17:49.790
your layout so and I should mention so
the activity main is the activity

00:17:49.790 --> 00:17:49.800
the activity main is the activity
 

00:17:49.800 --> 00:17:53.060
the activity main is the activity
main.xml file for the layout I defined

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:53.070
main.xml file for the layout I defined
 

00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:56.100
main.xml file for the layout I defined
so that's pretty much it to get a map in

00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:56.110
so that's pretty much it to get a map in
 

00:17:56.110 --> 00:17:59.039
so that's pretty much it to get a map in
your activity so their activity or

00:17:59.039 --> 00:17:59.049
your activity so their activity or
 

00:17:59.049 --> 00:18:02.489
your activity so their activity or
fragment so so with this actually with

00:18:02.489 --> 00:18:02.499
fragment so so with this actually with
 

00:18:02.499 --> 00:18:04.169
fragment so so with this actually with
this code here I'd have a map that was

00:18:04.169 --> 00:18:04.179
this code here I'd have a map that was
 

00:18:04.179 --> 00:18:07.710
this code here I'd have a map that was
basically the entire the entire view but

00:18:07.710 --> 00:18:07.720
basically the entire the entire view but
 

00:18:07.720 --> 00:18:09.299
basically the entire the entire view but
that fragment obviously you can put

00:18:09.299 --> 00:18:09.309
that fragment obviously you can put
 

00:18:09.309 --> 00:18:10.860
that fragment obviously you can put
anywhere and you view hierarchy so you

00:18:10.860 --> 00:18:10.870
anywhere and you view hierarchy so you
 

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:13.830
anywhere and you view hierarchy so you
can you could embed it you know below

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:13.840
can you could embed it you know below
 

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:17.970
can you could embed it you know below
some buttons or a modifiable pane and

00:18:17.970 --> 00:18:17.980
some buttons or a modifiable pane and
 

00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:19.560
some buttons or a modifiable pane and
now you can actually have more than one

00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:19.570
now you can actually have more than one
 

00:18:19.570 --> 00:18:22.139
now you can actually have more than one
oh yeah so for all those developers that

00:18:22.139 --> 00:18:22.149
oh yeah so for all those developers that
 

00:18:22.149 --> 00:18:24.659
oh yeah so for all those developers that
have been asking for a fragment from

00:18:24.659 --> 00:18:24.669
have been asking for a fragment from
 

00:18:24.669 --> 00:18:26.609
have been asking for a fragment from
that fragments we want to see these apps

00:18:26.609 --> 00:18:26.619
that fragments we want to see these apps
 

00:18:26.619 --> 00:18:28.409
that fragments we want to see these apps
that use more than one map at a time

00:18:28.409 --> 00:18:28.419
that use more than one map at a time
 

00:18:28.419 --> 00:18:31.139
that use more than one map at a time
yeah because I think it'll be

00:18:31.139 --> 00:18:31.149
yeah because I think it'll be
 

00:18:31.149 --> 00:18:32.460
yeah because I think it'll be
interesting to see how what kind of

00:18:32.460 --> 00:18:32.470
interesting to see how what kind of
 

00:18:32.470 --> 00:18:35.639
interesting to see how what kind of
experience you provide there keep in

00:18:35.639 --> 00:18:35.649
experience you provide there keep in
 

00:18:35.649 --> 00:18:37.320
experience you provide there keep in
mind that most of these typically Maps

00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:37.330
mind that most of these typically Maps
 

00:18:37.330 --> 00:18:38.999
mind that most of these typically Maps
allow you to pan as well so if you've

00:18:38.999 --> 00:18:39.009
allow you to pan as well so if you've
 

00:18:39.009 --> 00:18:40.680
allow you to pan as well so if you've
got swipe gestures and so on like if

00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:40.690
got swipe gestures and so on like if
 

00:18:40.690 --> 00:18:43.609
got swipe gestures and so on like if
using a view pager you know that that

00:18:43.609 --> 00:18:43.619
using a view pager you know that that
 

00:18:43.619 --> 00:18:46.200
using a view pager you know that that
introduces an an interesting dynamic

00:18:46.200 --> 00:18:46.210
introduces an an interesting dynamic
 

00:18:46.210 --> 00:18:48.419
introduces an an interesting dynamic
because the view pager itself can swipe

00:18:48.419 --> 00:18:48.429
because the view pager itself can swipe
 

00:18:48.429 --> 00:18:51.090
because the view pager itself can swipe
across pages but the if you're hosting a

00:18:51.090 --> 00:18:51.100
across pages but the if you're hosting a
 

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.859
across pages but the if you're hosting a
map it's gonna consume those swipe

00:18:52.859 --> 00:18:52.869
map it's gonna consume those swipe
 

00:18:52.869 --> 00:18:57.359
map it's gonna consume those swipe
events yeah just just keep these sorts

00:18:57.359 --> 00:18:57.369
events yeah just just keep these sorts
 

00:18:57.369 --> 00:19:00.600
events yeah just just keep these sorts
of things in mind you can do tricks like

00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:00.610
of things in mind you can do tricks like
 

00:19:00.610 --> 00:19:01.889
of things in mind you can do tricks like
with the view pager because you could

00:19:01.889 --> 00:19:01.899
with the view pager because you could
 

00:19:01.899 --> 00:19:04.680
with the view pager because you could
just press on the tab at the top to go

00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:04.690
just press on the tab at the top to go
 

00:19:04.690 --> 00:19:07.769
just press on the tab at the top to go
to the next page you can kind of get

00:19:07.769 --> 00:19:07.779
to the next page you can kind of get
 

00:19:07.779 --> 00:19:09.299
to the next page you can kind of get
away with it but if you've got a bunch

00:19:09.299 --> 00:19:09.309
away with it but if you've got a bunch
 

00:19:09.309 --> 00:19:11.369
away with it but if you've got a bunch
of pages where you swiping left or right

00:19:11.369 --> 00:19:11.379
of pages where you swiping left or right
 

00:19:11.379 --> 00:19:13.259
of pages where you swiping left or right
to go through them and suddenly there's

00:19:13.259 --> 00:19:13.269
to go through them and suddenly there's
 

00:19:13.269 --> 00:19:15.299
to go through them and suddenly there's
a map in there it's kind of seem

00:19:15.299 --> 00:19:15.309
a map in there it's kind of seem
 

00:19:15.309 --> 00:19:17.549
a map in there it's kind of seem
inconsistent to users where they're

00:19:17.549 --> 00:19:17.559
inconsistent to users where they're
 

00:19:17.559 --> 00:19:19.249
inconsistent to users where they're
being able to swipe across pages

00:19:19.249 --> 00:19:19.259
being able to swipe across pages
 

00:19:19.259 --> 00:19:21.450
being able to swipe across pages
sometimes you just got a static map in

00:19:21.450 --> 00:19:21.460
sometimes you just got a static map in
 

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:22.919
sometimes you just got a static map in
which case like it doesn't move so you

00:19:22.919 --> 00:19:22.929
which case like it doesn't move so you
 

00:19:22.929 --> 00:19:25.440
which case like it doesn't move so you
can just allow the swipes but if it's

00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:25.450
can just allow the swipes but if it's
 

00:19:25.450 --> 00:19:27.480
can just allow the swipes but if it's
consuming it just pay attention to the

00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:27.490
consuming it just pay attention to the
 

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.119
consuming it just pay attention to the
user experience all right yeah and if

00:19:30.119 --> 00:19:30.129
user experience all right yeah and if
 

00:19:30.129 --> 00:19:32.070
user experience all right yeah and if
you really want to see multiple maps in

00:19:32.070 --> 00:19:32.080
you really want to see multiple maps in
 

00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:34.080
you really want to see multiple maps in
an app at the same time definitely check

00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:34.090
an app at the same time definitely check
 

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:36.769
an app at the same time definitely check
out the the sample application the demo

00:19:36.769 --> 00:19:36.779
out the the sample application the demo
 

00:19:36.779 --> 00:19:40.529
out the the sample application the demo
app that's part of the the SDK tools so

00:19:40.529 --> 00:19:40.539
app that's part of the the SDK tools so
 

00:19:40.539 --> 00:19:42.180
app that's part of the the SDK tools so
that that actually will I think there's

00:19:42.180 --> 00:19:42.190
that that actually will I think there's
 

00:19:42.190 --> 00:19:43.619
that that actually will I think there's
one sample in there that has four maps

00:19:43.619 --> 00:19:43.629
one sample in there that has four maps
 

00:19:43.629 --> 00:19:46.470
one sample in there that has four maps
in a single view and they're all you

00:19:46.470 --> 00:19:46.480
in a single view and they're all you
 

00:19:46.480 --> 00:19:47.639
in a single view and they're all you
know all the events are being handled

00:19:47.639 --> 00:19:47.649
know all the events are being handled
 

00:19:47.649 --> 00:19:51.419
know all the events are being handled
independently pretty cool stuff so uh so

00:19:51.419 --> 00:19:51.429
independently pretty cool stuff so uh so
 

00:19:51.429 --> 00:19:53.820
independently pretty cool stuff so uh so
a couple of really important things on

00:19:53.820 --> 00:19:53.830
a couple of really important things on
 

00:19:53.830 --> 00:19:55.200
a couple of really important things on
I'm just gonna cover two kind of

00:19:55.200 --> 00:19:55.210
I'm just gonna cover two kind of
 

00:19:55.210 --> 00:19:56.940
I'm just gonna cover two kind of
high-level concepts or kind of important

00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:56.950
high-level concepts or kind of important
 

00:19:56.950 --> 00:19:58.259
high-level concepts or kind of important
map concepts and these are kind of the

00:19:58.259 --> 00:19:58.269
map concepts and these are kind of the
 

00:19:58.269 --> 00:20:01.560
map concepts and these are kind of the
basic use cases one is the camera so

00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:01.570
basic use cases one is the camera so
 

00:20:01.570 --> 00:20:03.930
basic use cases one is the camera so
that's actually you know kind of your

00:20:03.930 --> 00:20:03.940
that's actually you know kind of your
 

00:20:03.940 --> 00:20:06.390
that's actually you know kind of your
viewport into the map or

00:20:06.390 --> 00:20:06.400
viewport into the map or
 

00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.010
viewport into the map or
or what what part of the map that you're

00:20:08.010 --> 00:20:08.020
or what what part of the map that you're
 

00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.790
or what what part of the map that you're
actually looking at and the other is is

00:20:11.790 --> 00:20:11.800
actually looking at and the other is is
 

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:13.620
actually looking at and the other is is
markers markers are very fundamental to

00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:13.630
markers markers are very fundamental to
 

00:20:13.630 --> 00:20:16.230
markers markers are very fundamental to
- generally for most mapping

00:20:16.230 --> 00:20:16.240
- generally for most mapping
 

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.930
- generally for most mapping
applications so so camera and markers

00:20:18.930 --> 00:20:18.940
applications so so camera and markers
 

00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:20.640
applications so so camera and markers
are what we're gonna cover today there's

00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:20.650
are what we're gonna cover today there's
 

00:20:20.650 --> 00:20:22.290
are what we're gonna cover today there's
there's obviously a lot more features to

00:20:22.290 --> 00:20:22.300
there's obviously a lot more features to
 

00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.180
there's obviously a lot more features to
the API that we can cover in a later

00:20:24.180 --> 00:20:24.190
the API that we can cover in a later
 

00:20:24.190 --> 00:20:29.100
the API that we can cover in a later
show things like polylines and polygons

00:20:29.100 --> 00:20:29.110
show things like polylines and polygons
 

00:20:29.110 --> 00:20:32.640
show things like polylines and polygons
and polygons and ground overlays and

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:32.650
and polygons and ground overlays and
 

00:20:32.650 --> 00:20:35.100
and polygons and ground overlays and
that type of thing so just have a

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:35.110
that type of thing so just have a
 

00:20:35.110 --> 00:20:36.810
that type of thing so just have a
question for you pull for someone that

00:20:36.810 --> 00:20:36.820
question for you pull for someone that
 

00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.220
question for you pull for someone that
doesn't know what what would you define

00:20:38.220 --> 00:20:38.230
doesn't know what what would you define
 

00:20:38.230 --> 00:20:42.060
doesn't know what what would you define
as a market what does that mean so well

00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:42.070
as a market what does that mean so well
 

00:20:42.070 --> 00:20:43.680
as a market what does that mean so well
let's we'll cover that in just a second

00:20:43.680 --> 00:20:43.690
let's we'll cover that in just a second
 

00:20:43.690 --> 00:20:46.140
let's we'll cover that in just a second
I have an image of that so so marker

00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:46.150
I have an image of that so so marker
 

00:20:46.150 --> 00:20:48.690
I have an image of that so so marker
just fundamentally is just like if you

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:48.700
just fundamentally is just like if you
 

00:20:48.700 --> 00:20:52.830
just fundamentally is just like if you
want to put a marker or a pin on the map

00:20:52.830 --> 00:20:52.840
want to put a marker or a pin on the map
 

00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:54.780
want to put a marker or a pin on the map
as to where you where somebody or

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:54.790
as to where you where somebody or
 

00:20:54.790 --> 00:20:57.810
as to where you where somebody or
something is so the iconic marker that

00:20:57.810 --> 00:20:57.820
something is so the iconic marker that
 

00:20:57.820 --> 00:20:59.549
something is so the iconic marker that
we use for Google Maps is kind of

00:20:59.549 --> 00:20:59.559
we use for Google Maps is kind of
 

00:20:59.559 --> 00:21:01.410
we use for Google Maps is kind of
inverted teardrop who looks like the

00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:01.420
inverted teardrop who looks like the
 

00:21:01.420 --> 00:21:04.080
inverted teardrop who looks like the
inverted teardrop so it's sort of like

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:04.090
inverted teardrop so it's sort of like
 

00:21:04.090 --> 00:21:06.720
inverted teardrop so it's sort of like
in a fixed location I'm getting that

00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:06.730
in a fixed location I'm getting that
 

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.790
in a fixed location I'm getting that
sits on the map okay cool yeah well not

00:21:08.790 --> 00:21:08.800
sits on the map okay cool yeah well not
 

00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:10.230
sits on the map okay cool yeah well not
necessarily fixed I mean you can move

00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:10.240
necessarily fixed I mean you can move
 

00:21:10.240 --> 00:21:11.610
necessarily fixed I mean you can move
them around if you really want to and

00:21:11.610 --> 00:21:11.620
them around if you really want to and
 

00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.710
them around if you really want to and
it's actually relatively easy to move

00:21:13.710 --> 00:21:13.720
it's actually relatively easy to move
 

00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.810
it's actually relatively easy to move
around but yeah we'll cover a few of

00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:15.820
around but yeah we'll cover a few of
 

00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:17.820
around but yeah we'll cover a few of
these in a moment you know you'll see

00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:17.830
these in a moment you know you'll see
 

00:21:17.830 --> 00:21:20.520
these in a moment you know you'll see
see what they look like so so in terms

00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:20.530
see what they look like so so in terms
 

00:21:20.530 --> 00:21:21.299
see what they look like so so in terms
of the camera

00:21:21.299 --> 00:21:21.309
of the camera
 

00:21:21.309 --> 00:21:23.490
of the camera
the key concepts with camera is is the

00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:23.500
the key concepts with camera is is the
 

00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:25.260
the key concepts with camera is is the
obviously the camera location that's

00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:25.270
obviously the camera location that's
 

00:21:25.270 --> 00:21:26.730
obviously the camera location that's
that's actually where the camera

00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:26.740
that's actually where the camera
 

00:21:26.740 --> 00:21:29.430
that's actually where the camera
positioned over top the map and that can

00:21:29.430 --> 00:21:29.440
positioned over top the map and that can
 

00:21:29.440 --> 00:21:31.350
positioned over top the map and that can
actually take two forms it's a it's

00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:31.360
actually take two forms it's a it's
 

00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:33.750
actually take two forms it's a it's
lat/long so you can actually Center it

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:33.760
lat/long so you can actually Center it
 

00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:35.820
lat/long so you can actually Center it
on a certain point to the map or the

00:21:35.820 --> 00:21:35.830
on a certain point to the map or the
 

00:21:35.830 --> 00:21:37.919
on a certain point to the map or the
view of the the map and then the other

00:21:37.919 --> 00:21:37.929
view of the the map and then the other
 

00:21:37.929 --> 00:21:39.600
view of the the map and then the other
one is bounds and that takes two

00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:39.610
one is bounds and that takes two
 

00:21:39.610 --> 00:21:41.549
one is bounds and that takes two
lat/long object so you can say I want

00:21:41.549 --> 00:21:41.559
lat/long object so you can say I want
 

00:21:41.559 --> 00:21:44.220
lat/long object so you can say I want
the map centered at this point or I want

00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:44.230
the map centered at this point or I want
 

00:21:44.230 --> 00:21:46.919
the map centered at this point or I want
a certain area of the map to be just

00:21:46.919 --> 00:21:46.929
a certain area of the map to be just
 

00:21:46.929 --> 00:21:49.620
a certain area of the map to be just
viewable in the display and you do that

00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:49.630
viewable in the display and you do that
 

00:21:49.630 --> 00:21:52.590
viewable in the display and you do that
via the bounds and so to cover those

00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:52.600
via the bounds and so to cover those
 

00:21:52.600 --> 00:21:55.040
via the bounds and so to cover those
bounds by zooming out to cover those

00:21:55.040 --> 00:21:55.050
bounds by zooming out to cover those
 

00:21:55.050 --> 00:21:57.090
bounds by zooming out to cover those
exactly so let's say if you want to

00:21:57.090 --> 00:21:57.100
exactly so let's say if you want to
 

00:21:57.100 --> 00:21:59.460
exactly so let's say if you want to
actually show a neighborhood and you

00:21:59.460 --> 00:21:59.470
actually show a neighborhood and you
 

00:21:59.470 --> 00:22:01.830
actually show a neighborhood and you
know the the top left and bottom right

00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:01.840
know the the top left and bottom right
 

00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:03.270
know the the top left and bottom right
coordinates for that neighborhood in

00:22:03.270 --> 00:22:03.280
coordinates for that neighborhood in
 

00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.240
coordinates for that neighborhood in
terms of geographic terms you just say I

00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:06.250
terms of geographic terms you just say I
 

00:22:06.250 --> 00:22:08.580
terms of geographic terms you just say I
want to have this this bounce or this

00:22:08.580 --> 00:22:08.590
want to have this this bounce or this
 

00:22:08.590 --> 00:22:10.380
want to have this this bounce or this
bounding box actually displayed on my

00:22:10.380 --> 00:22:10.390
bounding box actually displayed on my
 

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:13.350
bounding box actually displayed on my
map and the map will actually reposition

00:22:13.350 --> 00:22:13.360
map and the map will actually reposition
 

00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.030
map and the map will actually reposition
it resuming position itself to actually

00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:15.040
it resuming position itself to actually
 

00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:17.520
it resuming position itself to actually
display the entire bounding area so very

00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:17.530
display the entire bounding area so very
 

00:22:17.530 --> 00:22:19.950
display the entire bounding area so very
useful if you wanted to display an area

00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:19.960
useful if you wanted to display an area
 

00:22:19.960 --> 00:22:22.070
useful if you wanted to display an area
supposed to display a particular point

00:22:22.070 --> 00:22:22.080
supposed to display a particular point
 

00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:24.030
supposed to display a particular point
discipling a particular point is just

00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:24.040
discipling a particular point is just
 

00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:26.520
discipling a particular point is just
you just need the lat/long zoom is

00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:26.530
you just need the lat/long zoom is
 

00:22:26.530 --> 00:22:28.920
you just need the lat/long zoom is
actually essentially how high the camera

00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:28.930
actually essentially how high the camera
 

00:22:28.930 --> 00:22:34.170
actually essentially how high the camera
is over the map so yeah I mean it's it's

00:22:34.170 --> 00:22:34.180
is over the map so yeah I mean it's it's
 

00:22:34.180 --> 00:22:35.970
is over the map so yeah I mean it's it's
fairly fundamental but it's it's kind of

00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:35.980
fairly fundamental but it's it's kind of
 

00:22:35.980 --> 00:22:38.640
fairly fundamental but it's it's kind of
kind of an al analogous to altitude

00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:38.650
kind of an al analogous to altitude
 

00:22:38.650 --> 00:22:42.390
kind of an al analogous to altitude
except that the its inverted so zero is

00:22:42.390 --> 00:22:42.400
except that the its inverted so zero is
 

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:45.210
except that the its inverted so zero is
actually zoomed all the way out and as

00:22:45.210 --> 00:22:45.220
actually zoomed all the way out and as
 

00:22:45.220 --> 00:22:48.960
actually zoomed all the way out and as
you zoom in you don't necessarily like

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:48.970
you zoom in you don't necessarily like
 

00:22:48.970 --> 00:22:50.790
you zoom in you don't necessarily like
if you're at zoom zero you won't

00:22:50.790 --> 00:22:50.800
if you're at zoom zero you won't
 

00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:53.460
if you're at zoom zero you won't
necessarily get the entire map zoom zero

00:22:53.460 --> 00:22:53.470
necessarily get the entire map zoom zero
 

00:22:53.470 --> 00:22:56.400
necessarily get the entire map zoom zero
just says that I'm going to go as far

00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:56.410
just says that I'm going to go as far
 

00:22:56.410 --> 00:23:00.030
just says that I'm going to go as far
out as the as the the viewport allows me

00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:00.040
out as the as the the viewport allows me
 

00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:02.910
out as the as the the viewport allows me
to so so if you have a very big screen I

00:23:02.910 --> 00:23:02.920
to so so if you have a very big screen I
 

00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:04.620
to so so if you have a very big screen I
haven't tried it done and let's say look

00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:04.630
haven't tried it done and let's say look
 

00:23:04.630 --> 00:23:07.050
haven't tried it done and let's say look
at Nexus 10 but presumably if you're

00:23:07.050 --> 00:23:07.060
at Nexus 10 but presumably if you're
 

00:23:07.060 --> 00:23:08.340
at Nexus 10 but presumably if you're
zoomed all the way out on Nexus 10

00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:08.350
zoomed all the way out on Nexus 10
 

00:23:08.350 --> 00:23:09.930
zoomed all the way out on Nexus 10
you'll actually see the entire map of

00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:09.940
you'll actually see the entire map of
 

00:23:09.940 --> 00:23:12.990
you'll actually see the entire map of
the world on a smaller device you'll

00:23:12.990 --> 00:23:13.000
the world on a smaller device you'll
 

00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.310
the world on a smaller device you'll
probably actually see a fraction of the

00:23:14.310 --> 00:23:14.320
probably actually see a fraction of the
 

00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.910
probably actually see a fraction of the
map I think it's like you'll see the

00:23:17.910 --> 00:23:17.920
map I think it's like you'll see the
 

00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:23.790
map I think it's like you'll see the
entire map if it's like 256 DP so so

00:23:23.790 --> 00:23:23.800
entire map if it's like 256 DP so so
 

00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:26.490
entire map if it's like 256 DP so so
bearing so so now that we have had

00:23:26.490 --> 00:23:26.500
bearing so so now that we have had
 

00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:28.230
bearing so so now that we have had
vector based maps and you can actually

00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:28.240
vector based maps and you can actually
 

00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:30.390
vector based maps and you can actually
rotate them which is a really cool

00:23:30.390 --> 00:23:30.400
rotate them which is a really cool
 

00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:34.970
rotate them which is a really cool
effect bearing is the is actually the

00:23:34.970 --> 00:23:34.980
effect bearing is the is actually the
 

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:38.460
effect bearing is the is actually the
kind of the rotation of the map mm-hmm

00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:38.470
kind of the rotation of the map mm-hmm
 

00:23:38.470 --> 00:23:42.020
kind of the rotation of the map mm-hmm
so and so it actually rotates clockwise

00:23:42.020 --> 00:23:42.030
so and so it actually rotates clockwise
 

00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:45.960
so and so it actually rotates clockwise
so bearing zero is north is at the top

00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:45.970
so bearing zero is north is at the top
 

00:23:45.970 --> 00:23:48.360
so bearing zero is north is at the top
of your interface and as you as you

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:48.370
of your interface and as you as you
 

00:23:48.370 --> 00:23:51.090
of your interface and as you as you
rotate rotate the bearing actually the

00:23:51.090 --> 00:23:51.100
rotate rotate the bearing actually the
 

00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:53.790
rotate rotate the bearing actually the
the map rotates clockwise and you go all

00:23:53.790 --> 00:23:53.800
the map rotates clockwise and you go all
 

00:23:53.800 --> 00:23:55.230
the map rotates clockwise and you go all
the way up to 360 and then you're back

00:23:55.230 --> 00:23:55.240
the way up to 360 and then you're back
 

00:23:55.240 --> 00:23:59.070
the way up to 360 and then you're back
to North so 90 degrees I think is north

00:23:59.070 --> 00:23:59.080
to North so 90 degrees I think is north
 

00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:00.720
to North so 90 degrees I think is north
on the right hand side of the the

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:00.730
on the right hand side of the the
 

00:24:00.730 --> 00:24:03.990
on the right hand side of the the
interface tilt again this is a nice

00:24:03.990 --> 00:24:04.000
interface tilt again this is a nice
 

00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.100
interface tilt again this is a nice
feature of the the nice feature of the

00:24:08.100 --> 00:24:08.110
feature of the the nice feature of the
 

00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:09.720
feature of the the nice feature of the
vector based maps is actually can look

00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:09.730
vector based maps is actually can look
 

00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.280
vector based maps is actually can look
at it at an angle so you don't have to

00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:11.290
at it at an angle so you don't have to
 

00:24:11.290 --> 00:24:12.810
at it at an angle so you don't have to
look at the map exactly you know

00:24:12.810 --> 00:24:12.820
look at the map exactly you know
 

00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:15.150
look at the map exactly you know
straighten down top down you can

00:24:15.150 --> 00:24:15.160
straighten down top down you can
 

00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:19.110
straighten down top down you can
actually specify a tilt between 0 0 is

00:24:19.110 --> 00:24:19.120
actually specify a tilt between 0 0 is
 

00:24:19.120 --> 00:24:21.840
actually specify a tilt between 0 0 is
actually top down and somewhere between

00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:21.850
actually top down and somewhere between
 

00:24:21.850 --> 00:24:24.960
actually top down and somewhere between
like 45 and 90 degrees so you get

00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:24.970
like 45 and 90 degrees so you get
 

00:24:24.970 --> 00:24:26.520
like 45 and 90 degrees so you get
depends on your zoom level as to what

00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:26.530
depends on your zoom level as to what
 

00:24:26.530 --> 00:24:28.860
depends on your zoom level as to what
how much tool you can have right exactly

00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:28.870
how much tool you can have right exactly
 

00:24:28.870 --> 00:24:31.800
how much tool you can have right exactly
exactly so so 45 is actually if you're

00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:31.810
exactly so so 45 is actually if you're
 

00:24:31.810 --> 00:24:33.580
exactly so so 45 is actually if you're
looking at a map at 45 you can

00:24:33.580 --> 00:24:33.590
looking at a map at 45 you can
 

00:24:33.590 --> 00:24:35.320
looking at a map at 45 you can
only see that there's there's an angle

00:24:35.320 --> 00:24:35.330
only see that there's there's an angle
 

00:24:35.330 --> 00:24:37.930
only see that there's there's an angle
there if you actually bring it below 45

00:24:37.930 --> 00:24:37.940
there if you actually bring it below 45
 

00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:39.789
there if you actually bring it below 45
you start to see some kind of 3d effects

00:24:39.789 --> 00:24:39.799
you start to see some kind of 3d effects
 

00:24:39.799 --> 00:24:42.039
you start to see some kind of 3d effects
it'll be like kind of little bit of kind

00:24:42.039 --> 00:24:42.049
it'll be like kind of little bit of kind
 

00:24:42.049 --> 00:24:43.690
it'll be like kind of little bit of kind
of flogging at the at the further end

00:24:43.690 --> 00:24:43.700
of flogging at the at the further end
 

00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.120
of flogging at the at the further end
and that type of thing so really great

00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:46.130
and that type of thing so really great
 

00:24:46.130 --> 00:24:47.830
and that type of thing so really great
effect if you're like you know doing

00:24:47.830 --> 00:24:47.840
effect if you're like you know doing
 

00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:49.930
effect if you're like you know doing
like moving through the map to have some

00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:49.940
like moving through the map to have some
 

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.360
like moving through the map to have some
kind of tilt on than that scrolling is

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:52.370
kind of tilt on than that scrolling is
 

00:24:52.370 --> 00:24:54.130
kind of tilt on than that scrolling is
actually just moving you know

00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:54.140
actually just moving you know
 

00:24:54.140 --> 00:24:56.649
actually just moving you know
programmatically moving the the position

00:24:56.649 --> 00:24:56.659
programmatically moving the the position
 

00:24:56.659 --> 00:24:59.950
programmatically moving the the position
of the map and animation is a really

00:24:59.950 --> 00:24:59.960
of the map and animation is a really
 

00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:02.769
of the map and animation is a really
important topic too because you're when

00:25:02.769 --> 00:25:02.779
important topic too because you're when
 

00:25:02.779 --> 00:25:04.450
important topic too because you're when
you're actually repositioning the map

00:25:04.450 --> 00:25:04.460
you're actually repositioning the map
 

00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:08.169
you're actually repositioning the map
you can either do it instantaneously so

00:25:08.169 --> 00:25:08.179
you can either do it instantaneously so
 

00:25:08.179 --> 00:25:10.269
you can either do it instantaneously so
it let's say I want to move from from

00:25:10.269 --> 00:25:10.279
it let's say I want to move from from
 

00:25:10.279 --> 00:25:12.610
it let's say I want to move from from
New York to San Francisco I can you know

00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:12.620
New York to San Francisco I can you know
 

00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:14.529
New York to San Francisco I can you know
have the map just display you know one

00:25:14.529 --> 00:25:14.539
have the map just display you know one
 

00:25:14.539 --> 00:25:15.940
have the map just display you know one
moment display New York and then when I

00:25:15.940 --> 00:25:15.950
moment display New York and then when I
 

00:25:15.950 --> 00:25:17.740
moment display New York and then when I
send the command actually have a display

00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:17.750
send the command actually have a display
 

00:25:17.750 --> 00:25:20.350
send the command actually have a display
San Francisco also you can actually have

00:25:20.350 --> 00:25:20.360
San Francisco also you can actually have
 

00:25:20.360 --> 00:25:23.710
San Francisco also you can actually have
that that camera change animated so you

00:25:23.710 --> 00:25:23.720
that that camera change animated so you
 

00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:25.240
that that camera change animated so you
can actually fly over the United States

00:25:25.240 --> 00:25:25.250
can actually fly over the United States
 

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:27.279
can actually fly over the United States
to go from New York to San Francisco

00:25:27.279 --> 00:25:27.289
to go from New York to San Francisco
 

00:25:27.289 --> 00:25:29.889
to go from New York to San Francisco
really nice effect for for a kind of

00:25:29.889 --> 00:25:29.899
really nice effect for for a kind of
 

00:25:29.899 --> 00:25:32.470
really nice effect for for a kind of
more advanced use cases generally use

00:25:32.470 --> 00:25:32.480
more advanced use cases generally use
 

00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:34.630
more advanced use cases generally use
case obviously just needed reposition

00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:34.640
case obviously just needed reposition
 

00:25:34.640 --> 00:25:37.720
case obviously just needed reposition
the map so I'll just add that these

00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:37.730
the map so I'll just add that these
 

00:25:37.730 --> 00:25:41.680
the map so I'll just add that these
capabilities of zoom rotational bearing

00:25:41.680 --> 00:25:41.690
capabilities of zoom rotational bearing
 

00:25:41.690 --> 00:25:44.620
capabilities of zoom rotational bearing
tilt and scrolling when you add the map

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:44.630
tilt and scrolling when you add the map
 

00:25:44.630 --> 00:25:47.200
tilt and scrolling when you add the map
yourself when you add it add the map

00:25:47.200 --> 00:25:47.210
yourself when you add it add the map
 

00:25:47.210 --> 00:25:49.720
yourself when you add it add the map
fragment that the typical touch controls

00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:49.730
fragment that the typical touch controls
 

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:51.519
fragment that the typical touch controls
come with it so by default they're

00:25:51.519 --> 00:25:51.529
come with it so by default they're
 

00:25:51.529 --> 00:25:54.010
come with it so by default they're
enabled so users can swipe to you know

00:25:54.010 --> 00:25:54.020
enabled so users can swipe to you know
 

00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:56.889
enabled so users can swipe to you know
chair to pan around for those of you

00:25:56.889 --> 00:25:56.899
chair to pan around for those of you
 

00:25:56.899 --> 00:25:58.360
chair to pan around for those of you
that don't know we have two finger

00:25:58.360 --> 00:25:58.370
that don't know we have two finger
 

00:25:58.370 --> 00:26:00.399
that don't know we have two finger
gestures for rotation where you hold one

00:26:00.399 --> 00:26:00.409
gestures for rotation where you hold one
 

00:26:00.409 --> 00:26:03.340
gestures for rotation where you hold one
finger steady and rotate your other

00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:03.350
finger steady and rotate your other
 

00:26:03.350 --> 00:26:06.279
finger steady and rotate your other
finger around that steady finger tilt is

00:26:06.279 --> 00:26:06.289
finger around that steady finger tilt is
 

00:26:06.289 --> 00:26:09.519
finger around that steady finger tilt is
two fingers up and down and while

00:26:09.519 --> 00:26:09.529
two fingers up and down and while
 

00:26:09.529 --> 00:26:11.260
two fingers up and down and while
scrolling and scrolling there's also a

00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:11.270
scrolling and scrolling there's also a
 

00:26:11.270 --> 00:26:13.480
scrolling and scrolling there's also a
trick for zoom obviously there's the

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:13.490
trick for zoom obviously there's the
 

00:26:13.490 --> 00:26:15.010
trick for zoom obviously there's the
sort of bringing pinching in your

00:26:15.010 --> 00:26:15.020
sort of bringing pinching in your
 

00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:16.570
sort of bringing pinching in your
fingers and pinching out but we've

00:26:16.570 --> 00:26:16.580
fingers and pinching out but we've
 

00:26:16.580 --> 00:26:18.490
fingers and pinching out but we've
actually got a one-handed gesture as

00:26:18.490 --> 00:26:18.500
actually got a one-handed gesture as
 

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:22.000
actually got a one-handed gesture as
well where you can double tap but on the

00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:22.010
well where you can double tap but on the
 

00:26:22.010 --> 00:26:24.130
well where you can double tap but on the
second tap you actually hold it down and

00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:24.140
second tap you actually hold it down and
 

00:26:24.140 --> 00:26:26.350
second tap you actually hold it down and
drag up and down and it zooms out so you

00:26:26.350 --> 00:26:26.360
drag up and down and it zooms out so you
 

00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.090
drag up and down and it zooms out so you
get this really nice when you've got

00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:28.100
get this really nice when you've got
 

00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:29.560
get this really nice when you've got
something like the phone in your hand

00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:29.570
something like the phone in your hand
 

00:26:29.570 --> 00:26:31.690
something like the phone in your hand
you can zoom on these maps without

00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:31.700
you can zoom on these maps without
 

00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:33.639
you can zoom on these maps without
having to put these gestures in the

00:26:33.639 --> 00:26:33.649
having to put these gestures in the
 

00:26:33.649 --> 00:26:35.049
having to put these gestures in the
reason it's important for developers to

00:26:35.049 --> 00:26:35.059
reason it's important for developers to
 

00:26:35.059 --> 00:26:37.000
reason it's important for developers to
know this is that it comes for free with

00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:37.010
know this is that it comes for free with
 

00:26:37.010 --> 00:26:38.500
know this is that it comes for free with
the map fragment you don't need to

00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:38.510
the map fragment you don't need to
 

00:26:38.510 --> 00:26:40.539
the map fragment you don't need to
implement it yourself you can override

00:26:40.539 --> 00:26:40.549
implement it yourself you can override
 

00:26:40.549 --> 00:26:42.909
implement it yourself you can override
them disable it if you want that yeah

00:26:42.909 --> 00:26:42.919
them disable it if you want that yeah
 

00:26:42.919 --> 00:26:44.289
them disable it if you want that yeah
yeah definitely

00:26:44.289 --> 00:26:44.299
yeah definitely
 

00:26:44.299 --> 00:26:46.510
yeah definitely
yeah these all these events are actually

00:26:46.510 --> 00:26:46.520
yeah these all these events are actually
 

00:26:46.520 --> 00:26:47.230
yeah these all these events are actually
when we get to mark

00:26:47.230 --> 00:26:47.240
when we get to mark
 

00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:49.960
when we get to mark
I'll cover a few of the events that you

00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:49.970
I'll cover a few of the events that you
 

00:26:49.970 --> 00:26:52.540
I'll cover a few of the events that you
receive on markers but yeah you you do

00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:52.550
receive on markers but yeah you you do
 

00:26:52.550 --> 00:26:54.160
receive on markers but yeah you you do
actually get a lot of these events you

00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:54.170
actually get a lot of these events you
 

00:26:54.170 --> 00:26:55.960
actually get a lot of these events you
can't override all of them but but a lot

00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:55.970
can't override all of them but but a lot
 

00:26:55.970 --> 00:27:00.520
can't override all of them but but a lot
of them are so but yeah that double tap

00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:00.530
of them are so but yeah that double tap
 

00:27:00.530 --> 00:27:02.710
of them are so but yeah that double tap
double tap and hold to zoom is

00:27:02.710 --> 00:27:02.720
double tap and hold to zoom is
 

00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:05.410
double tap and hold to zoom is
definitely a lifesaver a lot of times

00:27:05.410 --> 00:27:05.420
definitely a lifesaver a lot of times
 

00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.360
definitely a lifesaver a lot of times
you know using away you know no yeah but

00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:10.370
you know using away you know no yeah but
 

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.820
you know using away you know no yeah but
it's really good like if you wanna

00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:12.830
it's really good like if you wanna
 

00:27:12.830 --> 00:27:14.470
it's really good like if you wanna
because these are vector maps you can

00:27:14.470 --> 00:27:14.480
because these are vector maps you can
 

00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.360
because these are vector maps you can
actually you can zoom to any level

00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:16.370
actually you can zoom to any level
 

00:27:16.370 --> 00:27:18.160
actually you can zoom to any level
I mean it's actually continuous zooming

00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:18.170
I mean it's actually continuous zooming
 

00:27:18.170 --> 00:27:21.790
I mean it's actually continuous zooming
scale so so unlike you know like tile

00:27:21.790 --> 00:27:21.800
scale so so unlike you know like tile
 

00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.549
scale so so unlike you know like tile
based or raster based mapping where you

00:27:24.549 --> 00:27:24.559
based or raster based mapping where you
 

00:27:24.559 --> 00:27:27.220
based or raster based mapping where you
tend to do it at discrete levels so so

00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:27.230
tend to do it at discrete levels so so
 

00:27:27.230 --> 00:27:28.750
tend to do it at discrete levels so so
having the ability to actually kind of

00:27:28.750 --> 00:27:28.760
having the ability to actually kind of
 

00:27:28.760 --> 00:27:30.549
having the ability to actually kind of
just slide and zoom this is really nice

00:27:30.549 --> 00:27:30.559
just slide and zoom this is really nice
 

00:27:30.559 --> 00:27:33.700
just slide and zoom this is really nice
from from a user's perspective and the

00:27:33.700 --> 00:27:33.710
from from a user's perspective and the
 

00:27:33.710 --> 00:27:35.830
from from a user's perspective and the
last thing that we'll talk about a

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:35.840
last thing that we'll talk about a
 

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:37.930
last thing that we'll talk about a
little bit positioning versus updating

00:27:37.930 --> 00:27:37.940
little bit positioning versus updating
 

00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.110
little bit positioning versus updating
of the camera positioning just lost

00:27:41.110 --> 00:27:41.120
of the camera positioning just lost
 

00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.270
of the camera positioning just lost
lights yeah there we go so positioning

00:27:43.270 --> 00:27:43.280
lights yeah there we go so positioning
 

00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.850
lights yeah there we go so positioning
is actually moving the camera and that's

00:27:45.850 --> 00:27:45.860
is actually moving the camera and that's
 

00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:52.270
is actually moving the camera and that's
actually you specify all of the or so

00:27:52.270 --> 00:27:52.280
actually you specify all of the or so
 

00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.450
actually you specify all of the or so
between locations oome bearing and tilt

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:54.460
between locations oome bearing and tilt
 

00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:58.299
between locations oome bearing and tilt
whichever ones you want to you want to

00:27:58.299 --> 00:27:58.309
whichever ones you want to you want to
 

00:27:58.309 --> 00:28:01.270
whichever ones you want to you want to
specify of those four and you change the

00:28:01.270 --> 00:28:01.280
specify of those four and you change the
 

00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.620
specify of those four and you change the
camera position all the other ones are

00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:02.630
camera position all the other ones are
 

00:28:02.630 --> 00:28:05.140
camera position all the other ones are
actually defaulted so if I say you know

00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:05.150
actually defaulted so if I say you know
 

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.180
actually defaulted so if I say you know
move to New York and I just passed the

00:28:07.180 --> 00:28:07.190
move to New York and I just passed the
 

00:28:07.190 --> 00:28:09.520
move to New York and I just passed the
lat/longs to New York it'll go to

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:09.530
lat/longs to New York it'll go to
 

00:28:09.530 --> 00:28:11.200
lat/longs to New York it'll go to
default zoom level default bearing tilt

00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:11.210
default zoom level default bearing tilt
 

00:28:11.210 --> 00:28:14.049
default zoom level default bearing tilt
etc um and and that's actually really

00:28:14.049 --> 00:28:14.059
etc um and and that's actually really
 

00:28:14.059 --> 00:28:16.570
etc um and and that's actually really
great for you know positioning is kind

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:16.580
great for you know positioning is kind
 

00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.220
great for you know positioning is kind
of the default way to actually you know

00:28:18.220 --> 00:28:18.230
of the default way to actually you know
 

00:28:18.230 --> 00:28:20.320
of the default way to actually you know
move the mood view around the map

00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:20.330
move the mood view around the map
 

00:28:20.330 --> 00:28:22.120
move the mood view around the map
updating on the other hand camera

00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:22.130
updating on the other hand camera
 

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:24.040
updating on the other hand camera
updating is you're just changing a

00:28:24.040 --> 00:28:24.050
updating is you're just changing a
 

00:28:24.050 --> 00:28:27.700
updating is you're just changing a
particular particular attribute so for

00:28:27.700 --> 00:28:27.710
particular particular attribute so for
 

00:28:27.710 --> 00:28:29.140
particular particular attribute so for
example location so this is where

00:28:29.140 --> 00:28:29.150
example location so this is where
 

00:28:29.150 --> 00:28:31.060
example location so this is where
scrolling comes in is is if I want to

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.070
scrolling comes in is is if I want to
 

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:33.190
scrolling comes in is is if I want to
scroll the scroll the viewport left or

00:28:33.190 --> 00:28:33.200
scroll the scroll the viewport left or
 

00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:35.799
scroll the scroll the viewport left or
right or I want to actually zoom in like

00:28:35.799 --> 00:28:35.809
right or I want to actually zoom in like
 

00:28:35.809 --> 00:28:37.810
right or I want to actually zoom in like
one level or zoom out one level these

00:28:37.810 --> 00:28:37.820
one level or zoom out one level these
 

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.370
one level or zoom out one level these
are just updates I'm not actually

00:28:39.370 --> 00:28:39.380
are just updates I'm not actually
 

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:42.130
are just updates I'm not actually
changing the entire camera position so

00:28:42.130 --> 00:28:42.140
changing the entire camera position so
 

00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:44.049
changing the entire camera position so
position is for actually you know

00:28:44.049 --> 00:28:44.059
position is for actually you know
 

00:28:44.059 --> 00:28:45.430
position is for actually you know
starting from scratch and changing the

00:28:45.430 --> 00:28:45.440
starting from scratch and changing the
 

00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.260
starting from scratch and changing the
viewport or where the camera is

00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:47.270
viewport or where the camera is
 

00:28:47.270 --> 00:28:49.570
viewport or where the camera is
positioned over the map and updating is

00:28:49.570 --> 00:28:49.580
positioned over the map and updating is
 

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:51.370
positioned over the map and updating is
actually just incrementally changing so

00:28:51.370 --> 00:28:51.380
actually just incrementally changing so
 

00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.590
actually just incrementally changing so
an updating also animates to the

00:28:53.590 --> 00:28:53.600
an updating also animates to the
 

00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:55.630
an updating also animates to the
destination you can or can't

00:28:55.630 --> 00:28:55.640
destination you can or can't
 

00:28:55.640 --> 00:28:57.520
destination you can or can't
so animation is something that you you

00:28:57.520 --> 00:28:57.530
so animation is something that you you
 

00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.250
so animation is something that you you
essentially turn on or off so show a

00:29:00.250 --> 00:29:00.260
essentially turn on or off so show a
 

00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:01.160
essentially turn on or off so show a
little bit I think

00:29:01.160 --> 00:29:01.170
little bit I think
 

00:29:01.170 --> 00:29:04.510
little bit I think
slide or we have a little bit of code

00:29:04.510 --> 00:29:04.520
slide or we have a little bit of code
 

00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:07.880
slide or we have a little bit of code
yeah so uh so yeah actually I left the

00:29:07.880 --> 00:29:07.890
yeah so uh so yeah actually I left the
 

00:29:07.890 --> 00:29:09.170
yeah so uh so yeah actually I left the
animate out of this one but I think you

00:29:09.170 --> 00:29:09.180
animate out of this one but I think you
 

00:29:09.180 --> 00:29:11.540
animate out of this one but I think you
have a later slide so in terms of

00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:11.550
have a later slide so in terms of
 

00:29:11.550 --> 00:29:16.760
have a later slide so in terms of
position camera position so bearing and

00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:16.770
position camera position so bearing and
 

00:29:16.770 --> 00:29:19.310
position camera position so bearing and
tilt are actually only available in in

00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:19.320
tilt are actually only available in in
 

00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:22.430
tilt are actually only available in in
in position so bearing and tilt aren't

00:29:22.430 --> 00:29:22.440
in position so bearing and tilt aren't
 

00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:24.410
in position so bearing and tilt aren't
available in updates I'm not exactly

00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:24.420
available in updates I'm not exactly
 

00:29:24.420 --> 00:29:26.000
available in updates I'm not exactly
sure why we didn't include them in

00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:26.010
sure why we didn't include them in
 

00:29:26.010 --> 00:29:28.670
sure why we didn't include them in
updates probably because of the the

00:29:28.670 --> 00:29:28.680
updates probably because of the the
 

00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:33.920
updates probably because of the the
primary use cases of positioning but but

00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:33.930
primary use cases of positioning but but
 

00:29:33.930 --> 00:29:36.350
primary use cases of positioning but but
you can see here we there's a in this

00:29:36.350 --> 00:29:36.360
you can see here we there's a in this
 

00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.390
you can see here we there's a in this
camera position builder this is more or

00:29:38.390 --> 00:29:38.400
camera position builder this is more or
 

00:29:38.400 --> 00:29:41.630
camera position builder this is more or
less like a factory object I can

00:29:41.630 --> 00:29:41.640
less like a factory object I can
 

00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.340
less like a factory object I can
actually specify thing the target zoom

00:29:43.340 --> 00:29:43.350
actually specify thing the target zoom
 

00:29:43.350 --> 00:29:45.620
actually specify thing the target zoom
bearing and tilt zoom bearing and tilt

00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:45.630
bearing and tilt zoom bearing and tilt
 

00:29:45.630 --> 00:29:48.110
bearing and tilt zoom bearing and tilt
are all optional so if you just want to

00:29:48.110 --> 00:29:48.120
are all optional so if you just want to
 

00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:50.660
are all optional so if you just want to
reposition you know like I said it's the

00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:50.670
reposition you know like I said it's the
 

00:29:50.670 --> 00:29:53.630
reposition you know like I said it's the
default zoom bearing until levels you

00:29:53.630 --> 00:29:53.640
default zoom bearing until levels you
 

00:29:53.640 --> 00:29:55.850
default zoom bearing until levels you
just specify the target and the map will

00:29:55.850 --> 00:29:55.860
just specify the target and the map will
 

00:29:55.860 --> 00:29:57.170
just specify the target and the map will
kind of start over again at that

00:29:57.170 --> 00:29:57.180
kind of start over again at that
 

00:29:57.180 --> 00:29:59.810
kind of start over again at that
location the zoom bearing until you can

00:29:59.810 --> 00:29:59.820
location the zoom bearing until you can
 

00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.390
location the zoom bearing until you can
optionally set to get a particular

00:30:02.390 --> 00:30:02.400
optionally set to get a particular
 

00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:05.270
optionally set to get a particular
effect I'm a bit of a fan of the fact

00:30:05.270 --> 00:30:05.280
effect I'm a bit of a fan of the fact
 

00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.830
effect I'm a bit of a fan of the fact
that these methods will return the same

00:30:06.830 --> 00:30:06.840
that these methods will return the same
 

00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.780
that these methods will return the same
object back so that you can change in

00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:08.790
object back so that you can change in
 

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:11.060
object back so that you can change in
this nice way oh yeah without having a

00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:11.070
this nice way oh yeah without having a
 

00:30:11.070 --> 00:30:14.300
this nice way oh yeah without having a
ton of the bus code that you know states

00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:14.310
ton of the bus code that you know states
 

00:30:14.310 --> 00:30:16.400
ton of the bus code that you know states
the same object over and over again yeah

00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:16.410
the same object over and over again yeah
 

00:30:16.410 --> 00:30:17.690
the same object over and over again yeah
this is a really nice feature this

00:30:17.690 --> 00:30:17.700
this is a really nice feature this
 

00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:19.550
this is a really nice feature this
builder is that you just kind of build

00:30:19.550 --> 00:30:19.560
builder is that you just kind of build
 

00:30:19.560 --> 00:30:23.450
builder is that you just kind of build
these things up and fire them away so so

00:30:23.450 --> 00:30:23.460
these things up and fire them away so so
 

00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:24.920
these things up and fire them away so so
once you have this new camera position

00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:24.930
once you have this new camera position
 

00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.850
once you have this new camera position
so you you just pass it to the the

00:30:28.850 --> 00:30:28.860
so you you just pass it to the the
 

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:30.350
so you you just pass it to the the
camera update factory get your camera

00:30:30.350 --> 00:30:30.360
camera update factory get your camera
 

00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.480
camera update factory get your camera
update object out and then you just do

00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:32.490
update object out and then you just do
 

00:30:32.490 --> 00:30:35.240
update object out and then you just do
mapped out move camera and the other one

00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:35.250
mapped out move camera and the other one
 

00:30:35.250 --> 00:30:37.670
mapped out move camera and the other one
isn't called I'm gonna go to the oh yeah

00:30:37.670 --> 00:30:37.680
isn't called I'm gonna go to the oh yeah
 

00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.740
isn't called I'm gonna go to the oh yeah
I just cheated right there so the other

00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:39.750
I just cheated right there so the other
 

00:30:39.750 --> 00:30:42.830
I just cheated right there so the other
one no but it's not like this is

00:30:42.830 --> 00:30:42.840
one no but it's not like this is
 

00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.290
one no but it's not like this is
recorded or no of course not nobody

00:30:45.290 --> 00:30:45.300
recorded or no of course not nobody
 

00:30:45.300 --> 00:30:48.680
recorded or no of course not nobody
noticed that 10 frames slide switch that

00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:48.690
noticed that 10 frames slide switch that
 

00:30:48.690 --> 00:30:51.530
noticed that 10 frames slide switch that
I just did so yeah so map that move

00:30:51.530 --> 00:30:51.540
I just did so yeah so map that move
 

00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:53.690
I just did so yeah so map that move
camera you just passed the the updated

00:30:53.690 --> 00:30:53.700
camera you just passed the the updated
 

00:30:53.700 --> 00:30:56.870
camera you just passed the the updated
camp or the camera update map animate oh

00:30:56.870 --> 00:30:56.880
camp or the camera update map animate oh
 

00:30:56.880 --> 00:31:00.430
camp or the camera update map animate oh
geez I forgot already animate camera

00:31:00.430 --> 00:31:00.440
geez I forgot already animate camera
 

00:31:00.440 --> 00:31:03.050
geez I forgot already animate camera
will actually animate the transition so

00:31:03.050 --> 00:31:03.060
will actually animate the transition so
 

00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:04.790
will actually animate the transition so
so once you have this camera update

00:31:04.790 --> 00:31:04.800
so once you have this camera update
 

00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:06.440
so once you have this camera update
object you can make decision about how

00:31:06.440 --> 00:31:06.450
object you can make decision about how
 

00:31:06.450 --> 00:31:11.630
object you can make decision about how
you want to do the transition so camera

00:31:11.630 --> 00:31:11.640
you want to do the transition so camera
 

00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.040
you want to do the transition so camera
update on the other hand is a little bit

00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:13.050
update on the other hand is a little bit
 

00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:14.810
update on the other hand is a little bit
different so we're going directly to

00:31:14.810 --> 00:31:14.820
different so we're going directly to
 

00:31:14.820 --> 00:31:15.220
different so we're going directly to
that

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:15.230
that
 

00:31:15.230 --> 00:31:16.899
that
camera update class so we're not

00:31:16.899 --> 00:31:16.909
camera update class so we're not
 

00:31:16.909 --> 00:31:19.539
camera update class so we're not
actually using the camera position class

00:31:19.539 --> 00:31:19.549
actually using the camera position class
 

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:22.600
actually using the camera position class
so so here we have a camera update

00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:22.610
so so here we have a camera update
 

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:27.389
so so here we have a camera update
factory you know have to specify the

00:31:27.389 --> 00:31:27.399
factory you know have to specify the
 

00:31:27.399 --> 00:31:30.759
factory you know have to specify the
alright I can specify the lat/long like

00:31:30.759 --> 00:31:30.769
alright I can specify the lat/long like
 

00:31:30.769 --> 00:31:32.440
alright I can specify the lat/long like
I said before and that's for the the

00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:32.450
I said before and that's for the the
 

00:31:32.450 --> 00:31:35.049
I said before and that's for the the
center of the map I can also do like a

00:31:35.049 --> 00:31:35.059
center of the map I can also do like a
 

00:31:35.059 --> 00:31:38.830
center of the map I can also do like a
lat/long zoom here where I specify the a

00:31:38.830 --> 00:31:38.840
lat/long zoom here where I specify the a
 

00:31:38.840 --> 00:31:41.169
lat/long zoom here where I specify the a
new lat/long and zoom level and that can

00:31:41.169 --> 00:31:41.179
new lat/long and zoom level and that can
 

00:31:41.179 --> 00:31:43.090
new lat/long and zoom level and that can
also do the bounds here as well so if i

00:31:43.090 --> 00:31:43.100
also do the bounds here as well so if i
 

00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.310
also do the bounds here as well so if i
want to basically like zoom out to show

00:31:45.310 --> 00:31:45.320
want to basically like zoom out to show
 

00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:48.009
want to basically like zoom out to show
a neighborhood or zoom in to show like a

00:31:48.009 --> 00:31:48.019
a neighborhood or zoom in to show like a
 

00:31:48.019 --> 00:31:50.230
a neighborhood or zoom in to show like a
particular area of the city these are

00:31:50.230 --> 00:31:50.240
particular area of the city these are
 

00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:51.820
particular area of the city these are
these are very convenient functions for

00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:51.830
these are very convenient functions for
 

00:31:51.830 --> 00:31:53.799
these are very convenient functions for
doing that

00:31:53.799 --> 00:31:53.809
doing that
 

00:31:53.809 --> 00:31:55.629
doing that
so scrolling is actually part of the

00:31:55.629 --> 00:31:55.639
so scrolling is actually part of the
 

00:31:55.639 --> 00:31:58.120
so scrolling is actually part of the
camera update class as well so so

00:31:58.120 --> 00:31:58.130
camera update class as well so so
 

00:31:58.130 --> 00:32:00.789
camera update class as well so so
scrolling in zoom I mean that the the

00:32:00.789 --> 00:32:00.799
scrolling in zoom I mean that the the
 

00:32:00.799 --> 00:32:03.279
scrolling in zoom I mean that the the
primary use cases I see for these two as

00:32:03.279 --> 00:32:03.289
primary use cases I see for these two as
 

00:32:03.289 --> 00:32:05.470
primary use cases I see for these two as
opposed to using camera position is for

00:32:05.470 --> 00:32:05.480
opposed to using camera position is for
 

00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:07.090
opposed to using camera position is for
if you want to actually do your own map

00:32:07.090 --> 00:32:07.100
if you want to actually do your own map
 

00:32:07.100 --> 00:32:08.620
if you want to actually do your own map
control so let's say you want to provide

00:32:08.620 --> 00:32:08.630
control so let's say you want to provide
 

00:32:08.630 --> 00:32:09.970
control so let's say you want to provide
your own zoom buttons or you want to

00:32:09.970 --> 00:32:09.980
your own zoom buttons or you want to
 

00:32:09.980 --> 00:32:11.110
your own zoom buttons or you want to
actually provide your own panning

00:32:11.110 --> 00:32:11.120
actually provide your own panning
 

00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:14.259
actually provide your own panning
buttons these are really nice nice or a

00:32:14.259 --> 00:32:14.269
buttons these are really nice nice or a
 

00:32:14.269 --> 00:32:16.930
buttons these are really nice nice or a
nice class to use no the use cases let's

00:32:16.930 --> 00:32:16.940
nice class to use no the use cases let's
 

00:32:16.940 --> 00:32:19.120
nice class to use no the use cases let's
say you're you know you're you're

00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:19.130
say you're you know you're you're
 

00:32:19.130 --> 00:32:22.509
say you're you know you're you're
animating a sprite on the map so he's

00:32:22.509 --> 00:32:22.519
animating a sprite on the map so he's
 

00:32:22.519 --> 00:32:26.110
animating a sprite on the map so he's
walking across the map to you know to

00:32:26.110 --> 00:32:26.120
walking across the map to you know to
 

00:32:26.120 --> 00:32:29.620
walking across the map to you know to
show you know directions to the grocery

00:32:29.620 --> 00:32:29.630
show you know directions to the grocery
 

00:32:29.630 --> 00:32:31.180
show you know directions to the grocery
store I mean you can actually use this

00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:31.190
store I mean you can actually use this
 

00:32:31.190 --> 00:32:33.190
store I mean you can actually use this
scrolling object to or the scrolling

00:32:33.190 --> 00:32:33.200
scrolling object to or the scrolling
 

00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:36.399
scrolling object to or the scrolling
methods actually scroll the the change

00:32:36.399 --> 00:32:36.409
methods actually scroll the the change
 

00:32:36.409 --> 00:32:38.919
methods actually scroll the the change
so and again these are actually animated

00:32:38.919 --> 00:32:38.929
so and again these are actually animated
 

00:32:38.929 --> 00:32:42.009
so and again these are actually animated
or not animated so interesting thing

00:32:42.009 --> 00:32:42.019
or not animated so interesting thing
 

00:32:42.019 --> 00:32:43.870
or not animated so interesting thing
about zoom is you can actually do zoom

00:32:43.870 --> 00:32:43.880
about zoom is you can actually do zoom
 

00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:46.649
about zoom is you can actually do zoom
in zoom out zoom by a certain percentage

00:32:46.649 --> 00:32:46.659
in zoom out zoom by a certain percentage
 

00:32:46.659 --> 00:32:51.720
in zoom out zoom by a certain percentage
or zoom to one of the discrete levels

00:32:51.720 --> 00:32:51.730
 

00:32:51.730 --> 00:32:55.539
markers so we'll kind of kind of like

00:32:55.539 --> 00:32:55.549
markers so we'll kind of kind of like
 

00:32:55.549 --> 00:32:57.759
markers so we'll kind of kind of like
about these real quick so markers so you

00:32:57.759 --> 00:32:57.769
about these real quick so markers so you
 

00:32:57.769 --> 00:32:59.649
about these real quick so markers so you
know positioning markers is obviously

00:32:59.649 --> 00:32:59.659
know positioning markers is obviously
 

00:32:59.659 --> 00:33:01.029
know positioning markers is obviously
very important because markers actually

00:33:01.029 --> 00:33:01.039
very important because markers actually
 

00:33:01.039 --> 00:33:03.580
very important because markers actually
show a particular location geo location

00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:03.590
show a particular location geo location
 

00:33:03.590 --> 00:33:06.310
show a particular location geo location
on the map info windows these are this

00:33:06.310 --> 00:33:06.320
on the map info windows these are this
 

00:33:06.320 --> 00:33:08.680
on the map info windows these are this
information that's related to a position

00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:08.690
information that's related to a position
 

00:33:08.690 --> 00:33:10.560
information that's related to a position
or a marker that you can display

00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:10.570
or a marker that you can display
 

00:33:10.570 --> 00:33:13.000
or a marker that you can display
dragging dragging is actually can allow

00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:13.010
dragging dragging is actually can allow
 

00:33:13.010 --> 00:33:15.120
dragging dragging is actually can allow
users to move the marker around the map

00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:15.130
users to move the marker around the map
 

00:33:15.130 --> 00:33:17.379
users to move the marker around the map
if they want to this is a little bit of

00:33:17.379 --> 00:33:17.389
if they want to this is a little bit of
 

00:33:17.389 --> 00:33:18.700
if they want to this is a little bit of
a bad thing that was actually really

00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:18.710
a bad thing that was actually really
 

00:33:18.710 --> 00:33:21.730
a bad thing that was actually really
easy to do icons so there's obviously

00:33:21.730 --> 00:33:21.740
easy to do icons so there's obviously
 

00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:24.129
easy to do icons so there's obviously
default marker icon which I said before

00:33:24.129 --> 00:33:24.139
default marker icon which I said before
 

00:33:24.139 --> 00:33:26.560
default marker icon which I said before
is kind of an inverted teardrop but you

00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:26.570
is kind of an inverted teardrop but you
 

00:33:26.570 --> 00:33:28.490
is kind of an inverted teardrop but you
can actually customize it

00:33:28.490 --> 00:33:28.500
can actually customize it
 

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:32.120
can actually customize it
you can actually well I actually have

00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:32.130
you can actually well I actually have
 

00:33:32.130 --> 00:33:33.200
you can actually well I actually have
this a little bit wrong so so

00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:33.210
this a little bit wrong so so
 

00:33:33.210 --> 00:33:35.060
this a little bit wrong so so
customizing is actually part of info

00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:35.070
customizing is actually part of info
 

00:33:35.070 --> 00:33:37.160
customizing is actually part of info
windows that we'll talk about later but

00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:37.170
windows that we'll talk about later but
 

00:33:37.170 --> 00:33:38.870
windows that we'll talk about later but
icons you can actually customize by

00:33:38.870 --> 00:33:38.880
icons you can actually customize by
 

00:33:38.880 --> 00:33:41.230
icons you can actually customize by
doing specifying unique colors

00:33:41.230 --> 00:33:41.240
doing specifying unique colors
 

00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:43.700
doing specifying unique colors
specifying your images or bitmaps

00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:43.710
specifying your images or bitmaps
 

00:33:43.710 --> 00:33:46.490
specifying your images or bitmaps
and specifying how the anchor and then

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:46.500
and specifying how the anchor and then
 

00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.880
and specifying how the anchor and then
there's a been Sun on markers as well so

00:33:49.880 --> 00:33:49.890
there's a been Sun on markers as well so
 

00:33:49.890 --> 00:33:51.470
there's a been Sun on markers as well so
in terms of positioning info windows and

00:33:51.470 --> 00:33:51.480
in terms of positioning info windows and
 

00:33:51.480 --> 00:33:53.570
in terms of positioning info windows and
dragging really easy to do I mean this

00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:53.580
dragging really easy to do I mean this
 

00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:56.600
dragging really easy to do I mean this
is a huge updates from the last for the

00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:56.610
is a huge updates from the last for the
 

00:33:56.610 --> 00:34:00.860
is a huge updates from the last for the
map view 1.0 is that position you you

00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:00.870
map view 1.0 is that position you you
 

00:34:00.870 --> 00:34:02.480
map view 1.0 is that position you you
just basically you add a marker to your

00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:02.490
just basically you add a marker to your
 

00:34:02.490 --> 00:34:04.640
just basically you add a marker to your
map you specify your marker options and

00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:04.650
map you specify your marker options and
 

00:34:04.650 --> 00:34:07.220
map you specify your marker options and
then you you you said whatever

00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:07.230
then you you you said whatever
 

00:34:07.230 --> 00:34:09.710
then you you you said whatever
properties you want position is you

00:34:09.710 --> 00:34:09.720
properties you want position is you
 

00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:11.030
properties you want position is you
absolutely have to have a position if

00:34:11.030 --> 00:34:11.040
absolutely have to have a position if
 

00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:12.169
absolutely have to have a position if
you don't have a position for your

00:34:12.169 --> 00:34:12.179
you don't have a position for your
 

00:34:12.179 --> 00:34:13.879
you don't have a position for your
marketing you try to place it on the map

00:34:13.879 --> 00:34:13.889
marketing you try to place it on the map
 

00:34:13.889 --> 00:34:16.879
marketing you try to place it on the map
you're gonna get an exception title

00:34:16.879 --> 00:34:16.889
you're gonna get an exception title
 

00:34:16.889 --> 00:34:18.649
you're gonna get an exception title
won't snippet and draggable are all

00:34:18.649 --> 00:34:18.659
won't snippet and draggable are all
 

00:34:18.659 --> 00:34:22.010
won't snippet and draggable are all
optional so if you specify title and/or

00:34:22.010 --> 00:34:22.020
optional so if you specify title and/or
 

00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.379
optional so if you specify title and/or
snippet actually get an info window so

00:34:24.379 --> 00:34:24.389
snippet actually get an info window so
 

00:34:24.389 --> 00:34:26.330
snippet actually get an info window so
on the right hand side the the red

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:26.340
on the right hand side the the red
 

00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.010
on the right hand side the the red
inverted teardrop is actually the marker

00:34:28.010 --> 00:34:28.020
inverted teardrop is actually the marker
 

00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.110
inverted teardrop is actually the marker
just to show where the where the

00:34:30.110 --> 00:34:30.120
just to show where the where the
 

00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.770
just to show where the where the
position is the lat/long coordinates are

00:34:33.770 --> 00:34:33.780
position is the lat/long coordinates are
 

00:34:33.780 --> 00:34:36.950
position is the lat/long coordinates are
and the you know the title and sniff is

00:34:36.950 --> 00:34:36.960
and the you know the title and sniff is
 

00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.590
and the you know the title and sniff is
show up in the info window so so by

00:34:39.590 --> 00:34:39.600
show up in the info window so so by
 

00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.899
show up in the info window so so by
default info windows are off you can

00:34:41.899 --> 00:34:41.909
default info windows are off you can
 

00:34:41.909 --> 00:34:43.310
default info windows are off you can
actually turn them on I think it's

00:34:43.310 --> 00:34:43.320
actually turn them on I think it's
 

00:34:43.320 --> 00:34:45.230
actually turn them on I think it's
actually marker dot show info window

00:34:45.230 --> 00:34:45.240
actually marker dot show info window
 

00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.480
actually marker dot show info window
that will actually programmatically

00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:47.490
that will actually programmatically
 

00:34:47.490 --> 00:34:51.710
that will actually programmatically
display the info window and and there's

00:34:51.710 --> 00:34:51.720
display the info window and and there's
 

00:34:51.720 --> 00:34:53.510
display the info window and and there's
also I believe a hide method as well so

00:34:53.510 --> 00:34:53.520
also I believe a hide method as well so
 

00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.860
also I believe a hide method as well so
if you want to programmatically hide it

00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:54.870
if you want to programmatically hide it
 

00:34:54.870 --> 00:34:57.620
if you want to programmatically hide it
so so by default they're off by default

00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:57.630
so so by default they're off by default
 

00:34:57.630 --> 00:35:00.380
so so by default they're off by default
if the user if if you specify title or

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:00.390
if the user if if you specify title or
 

00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.480
if the user if if you specify title or
snippet and user touches the marker

00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:02.490
snippet and user touches the marker
 

00:35:02.490 --> 00:35:04.240
snippet and user touches the marker
you'll you'll see the info window

00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:04.250
you'll you'll see the info window
 

00:35:04.250 --> 00:35:06.590
you'll you'll see the info window
draggable is a neat thing is you have to

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:06.600
draggable is a neat thing is you have to
 

00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:08.180
draggable is a neat thing is you have to
see it to understand exactly what it

00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:08.190
see it to understand exactly what it
 

00:35:08.190 --> 00:35:10.430
see it to understand exactly what it
does but if user long presses that the

00:35:10.430 --> 00:35:10.440
does but if user long presses that the
 

00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.050
does but if user long presses that the
default behavior is that if a user long

00:35:12.050 --> 00:35:12.060
default behavior is that if a user long
 

00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:14.570
default behavior is that if a user long
presses a marker and the marker is

00:35:14.570 --> 00:35:14.580
presses a marker and the marker is
 

00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:16.430
presses a marker and the marker is
draggable which is specified with this

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:16.440
draggable which is specified with this
 

00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:20.210
draggable which is specified with this
draggable true the marker actually

00:35:20.210 --> 00:35:20.220
draggable true the marker actually
 

00:35:20.220 --> 00:35:23.030
draggable true the marker actually
becomes repositionable by the user so so

00:35:23.030 --> 00:35:23.040
becomes repositionable by the user so so
 

00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.380
becomes repositionable by the user so so
this is a really great use case if you

00:35:24.380 --> 00:35:24.390
this is a really great use case if you
 

00:35:24.390 --> 00:35:26.450
this is a really great use case if you
want the user to let's say you want to

00:35:26.450 --> 00:35:26.460
want the user to let's say you want to
 

00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.770
want the user to let's say you want to
actually get feedback from the user

00:35:27.770 --> 00:35:27.780
actually get feedback from the user
 

00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:32.950
actually get feedback from the user
about the the location of something so

00:35:32.950 --> 00:35:32.960
about the the location of something so
 

00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:36.020
about the the location of something so
so in terms of the icons or the images

00:35:36.020 --> 00:35:36.030
so in terms of the icons or the images
 

00:35:36.030 --> 00:35:40.970
so in terms of the icons or the images
so so all this is actually access to

00:35:40.970 --> 00:35:40.980
so so all this is actually access to
 

00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:42.109
so so all this is actually access to
this marker option

00:35:42.109 --> 00:35:42.119
this marker option
 

00:35:42.119 --> 00:35:44.329
this marker option
so the specified marker images are

00:35:44.329 --> 00:35:44.339
so the specified marker images are
 

00:35:44.339 --> 00:35:47.989
so the specified marker images are
colors images and anchoring via the the

00:35:47.989 --> 00:35:47.999
colors images and anchoring via the the
 

00:35:47.999 --> 00:35:50.359
colors images and anchoring via the the
marker options class so so as I said

00:35:50.359 --> 00:35:50.369
marker options class so so as I said
 

00:35:50.369 --> 00:35:52.579
marker options class so so as I said
before position is apps has to be in all

00:35:52.579 --> 00:35:52.589
before position is apps has to be in all
 

00:35:52.589 --> 00:35:54.440
before position is apps has to be in all
these all these actually show position

00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:54.450
these all these actually show position
 

00:35:54.450 --> 00:35:58.039
these all these actually show position
here but so the first thing is that you

00:35:58.039 --> 00:35:58.049
here but so the first thing is that you
 

00:35:58.049 --> 00:35:59.809
here but so the first thing is that you
can pretty easily change the color this

00:35:59.809 --> 00:35:59.819
can pretty easily change the color this
 

00:35:59.819 --> 00:36:01.519
can pretty easily change the color this
is using this bitmap descriptor Factory

00:36:01.519 --> 00:36:01.529
is using this bitmap descriptor Factory
 

00:36:01.529 --> 00:36:03.890
is using this bitmap descriptor Factory
and you actually just specify the the

00:36:03.890 --> 00:36:03.900
and you actually just specify the the
 

00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.690
and you actually just specify the the
hue you can specify use one of our

00:36:05.690 --> 00:36:05.700
hue you can specify use one of our
 

00:36:05.700 --> 00:36:08.420
hue you can specify use one of our
pre-canned hues get more exactly how

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:08.430
pre-canned hues get more exactly how
 

00:36:08.430 --> 00:36:10.339
pre-canned hues get more exactly how
many of them there are but there's

00:36:10.339 --> 00:36:10.349
many of them there are but there's
 

00:36:10.349 --> 00:36:12.470
many of them there are but there's
there's a fair number of pretty

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:12.480
there's a fair number of pretty
 

00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.920
there's a fair number of pretty
appealing colors and or you can actually

00:36:15.920 --> 00:36:15.930
appealing colors and or you can actually
 

00:36:15.930 --> 00:36:19.519
appealing colors and or you can actually
specify the hue using a float you can

00:36:19.519 --> 00:36:19.529
specify the hue using a float you can
 

00:36:19.529 --> 00:36:21.319
specify the hue using a float you can
specify your own image the easiest way

00:36:21.319 --> 00:36:21.329
specify your own image the easiest way
 

00:36:21.329 --> 00:36:22.999
specify your own image the easiest way
to get the image in there is is having

00:36:22.999 --> 00:36:23.009
to get the image in there is is having
 

00:36:23.009 --> 00:36:25.940
to get the image in there is is having
it in your apk and just specify the

00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:25.950
it in your apk and just specify the
 

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.299
it in your apk and just specify the
resource to to load the bitmap you I

00:36:29.299 --> 00:36:29.309
resource to to load the bitmap you I
 

00:36:29.309 --> 00:36:31.009
resource to to load the bitmap you I
think there's a number of other ways you

00:36:31.009 --> 00:36:31.019
think there's a number of other ways you
 

00:36:31.019 --> 00:36:32.890
think there's a number of other ways you
can actually you know pass a bitmap

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:32.900
can actually you know pass a bitmap
 

00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:34.880
can actually you know pass a bitmap
object if you want so you could actually

00:36:34.880 --> 00:36:34.890
object if you want so you could actually
 

00:36:34.890 --> 00:36:38.089
object if you want so you could actually
generate a marker image on the fly if

00:36:38.089 --> 00:36:38.099
generate a marker image on the fly if
 

00:36:38.099 --> 00:36:41.569
generate a marker image on the fly if
you really wanted to I think the other

00:36:41.569 --> 00:36:41.579
you really wanted to I think the other
 

00:36:41.579 --> 00:36:43.400
you really wanted to I think the other
options it's like a resource identifier

00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:43.410
options it's like a resource identifier
 

00:36:43.410 --> 00:36:45.859
options it's like a resource identifier
you can specify been that object you can

00:36:45.859 --> 00:36:45.869
you can specify been that object you can
 

00:36:45.869 --> 00:36:48.229
you can specify been that object you can
specify a file usually if you want to

00:36:48.229 --> 00:36:48.239
specify a file usually if you want to
 

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.759
specify a file usually if you want to
actually load the file out of storage

00:36:49.759 --> 00:36:49.769
actually load the file out of storage
 

00:36:49.769 --> 00:36:52.339
actually load the file out of storage
yes I use typically for the file

00:36:52.339 --> 00:36:52.349
yes I use typically for the file
 

00:36:52.349 --> 00:36:53.900
yes I use typically for the file
situation you might want to download it

00:36:53.900 --> 00:36:53.910
situation you might want to download it
 

00:36:53.910 --> 00:36:57.680
situation you might want to download it
from from the web or something but yeah

00:36:57.680 --> 00:36:57.690
from from the web or something but yeah
 

00:36:57.690 --> 00:36:59.720
from from the web or something but yeah
as much as possible you want to use

00:36:59.720 --> 00:36:59.730
as much as possible you want to use
 

00:36:59.730 --> 00:37:01.789
as much as possible you want to use
resource IDs because you can check them

00:37:01.789 --> 00:37:01.799
resource IDs because you can check them
 

00:37:01.799 --> 00:37:04.309
resource IDs because you can check them
in those drawable directories and get

00:37:04.309 --> 00:37:04.319
in those drawable directories and get
 

00:37:04.319 --> 00:37:07.249
in those drawable directories and get
the right scaled image for whatever dpi

00:37:07.249 --> 00:37:07.259
the right scaled image for whatever dpi
 

00:37:07.259 --> 00:37:11.269
the right scaled image for whatever dpi
the device is running at that time yeah

00:37:11.269 --> 00:37:11.279
the device is running at that time yeah
 

00:37:11.279 --> 00:37:13.970
the device is running at that time yeah
really the the primary use case I see

00:37:13.970 --> 00:37:13.980
really the the primary use case I see
 

00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:18.079
really the the primary use case I see
were for using a file or a bitmap for

00:37:18.079 --> 00:37:18.089
were for using a file or a bitmap for
 

00:37:18.089 --> 00:37:21.170
were for using a file or a bitmap for
that matter is actually if you're you're

00:37:21.170 --> 00:37:21.180
that matter is actually if you're you're
 

00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.779
that matter is actually if you're you're
doing something like overlaying images

00:37:23.779 --> 00:37:23.789
doing something like overlaying images
 

00:37:23.789 --> 00:37:26.809
doing something like overlaying images
for example on your map so there you're

00:37:26.809 --> 00:37:26.819
for example on your map so there you're
 

00:37:26.819 --> 00:37:28.579
for example on your map so there you're
specifying like let's say this image is

00:37:28.579 --> 00:37:28.589
specifying like let's say this image is
 

00:37:28.589 --> 00:37:30.380
specifying like let's say this image is
associated with this position on the map

00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:30.390
associated with this position on the map
 

00:37:30.390 --> 00:37:31.999
associated with this position on the map
so you could you could actually just

00:37:31.999 --> 00:37:32.009
so you could you could actually just
 

00:37:32.009 --> 00:37:35.569
so you could you could actually just
load that up in a load that from you

00:37:35.569 --> 00:37:35.579
load that up in a load that from you
 

00:37:35.579 --> 00:37:38.979
load that up in a load that from you
know local storage or over the wire so

00:37:38.979 --> 00:37:38.989
know local storage or over the wire so
 

00:37:38.989 --> 00:37:41.479
know local storage or over the wire so
cool as opposed to out of your your

00:37:41.479 --> 00:37:41.489
cool as opposed to out of your your
 

00:37:41.489 --> 00:37:43.309
cool as opposed to out of your your
resources directory but but if you're if

00:37:43.309 --> 00:37:43.319
resources directory but but if you're if
 

00:37:43.319 --> 00:37:44.960
resources directory but but if you're if
you're just reusing the same icon over

00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:44.970
you're just reusing the same icon over
 

00:37:44.970 --> 00:37:46.430
you're just reusing the same icon over
and over again definitely drop it into

00:37:46.430 --> 00:37:46.440
and over again definitely drop it into
 

00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:49.549
and over again definitely drop it into
resources directory and so anchoring

00:37:49.549 --> 00:37:49.559
resources directory and so anchoring
 

00:37:49.559 --> 00:37:52.640
resources directory and so anchoring
because these you can specify so I'm

00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:52.650
because these you can specify so I'm
 

00:37:52.650 --> 00:37:53.809
because these you can specify so I'm
just gonna go back to the last slide

00:37:53.809 --> 00:37:53.819
just gonna go back to the last slide
 

00:37:53.819 --> 00:37:55.320
just gonna go back to the last slide
real quick so so the

00:37:55.320 --> 00:37:55.330
real quick so so the
 

00:37:55.330 --> 00:37:57.120
real quick so so the
anchor on the default marker is actually

00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:57.130
anchor on the default marker is actually
 

00:37:57.130 --> 00:37:59.940
anchor on the default marker is actually
the very bottom center of that that red

00:37:59.940 --> 00:37:59.950
the very bottom center of that that red
 

00:37:59.950 --> 00:38:02.340
the very bottom center of that that red
teardrop so that's actually where the

00:38:02.340 --> 00:38:02.350
teardrop so that's actually where the
 

00:38:02.350 --> 00:38:03.840
teardrop so that's actually where the
the coordinates are when I specify it

00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:03.850
the coordinates are when I specify it
 

00:38:03.850 --> 00:38:06.120
the coordinates are when I specify it
well in this case show zero zero with us

00:38:06.120 --> 00:38:06.130
well in this case show zero zero with us
 

00:38:06.130 --> 00:38:07.580
well in this case show zero zero with us
definitely not San Francisco that long

00:38:07.580 --> 00:38:07.590
definitely not San Francisco that long
 

00:38:07.590 --> 00:38:11.880
definitely not San Francisco that long
but so the the lat/long is actually

00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:11.890
but so the the lat/long is actually
 

00:38:11.890 --> 00:38:14.010
but so the the lat/long is actually
associated with the the bottom center of

00:38:14.010 --> 00:38:14.020
associated with the the bottom center of
 

00:38:14.020 --> 00:38:17.390
associated with the the bottom center of
that teardrop which is the the pinpoint

00:38:17.390 --> 00:38:17.400
that teardrop which is the the pinpoint
 

00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:19.620
that teardrop which is the the pinpoint
so you can actually change that however

00:38:19.620 --> 00:38:19.630
so you can actually change that however
 

00:38:19.630 --> 00:38:22.440
so you can actually change that however
so so what I had done before I will show

00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:22.450
so so what I had done before I will show
 

00:38:22.450 --> 00:38:26.220
so so what I had done before I will show
you show you but you can create your own

00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:26.230
you show you but you can create your own
 

00:38:26.230 --> 00:38:28.110
you show you but you can create your own
custom marker icon and you can do things

00:38:28.110 --> 00:38:28.120
custom marker icon and you can do things
 

00:38:28.120 --> 00:38:30.690
custom marker icon and you can do things
like put a drop shadow auditor or some

00:38:30.690 --> 00:38:30.700
like put a drop shadow auditor or some
 

00:38:30.700 --> 00:38:33.030
like put a drop shadow auditor or some
you can have it like offset it a little

00:38:33.030 --> 00:38:33.040
you can have it like offset it a little
 

00:38:33.040 --> 00:38:35.700
you can have it like offset it a little
bit to the right so you can the the pin

00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:35.710
bit to the right so you can the the pin
 

00:38:35.710 --> 00:38:37.260
bit to the right so you can the the pin
point off a little bit to the left or

00:38:37.260 --> 00:38:37.270
point off a little bit to the left or
 

00:38:37.270 --> 00:38:39.420
point off a little bit to the left or
right so you can I don't know just

00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:39.430
right so you can I don't know just
 

00:38:39.430 --> 00:38:40.920
right so you can I don't know just
customize it to make it look a little

00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:40.930
customize it to make it look a little
 

00:38:40.930 --> 00:38:42.420
customize it to make it look a little
more appealing for your application if

00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:42.430
more appealing for your application if
 

00:38:42.430 --> 00:38:44.340
more appealing for your application if
you do that you have to set a new anchor

00:38:44.340 --> 00:38:44.350
you do that you have to set a new anchor
 

00:38:44.350 --> 00:38:46.020
you do that you have to set a new anchor
point and that's the very last method

00:38:46.020 --> 00:38:46.030
point and that's the very last method
 

00:38:46.030 --> 00:38:48.300
point and that's the very last method
down in the the anchoring section so as

00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:48.310
down in the the anchoring section so as
 

00:38:48.310 --> 00:38:50.670
down in the the anchoring section so as
a percentage from top left what a good

00:38:50.670 --> 00:38:50.680
a percentage from top left what a good
 

00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:52.260
a percentage from top left what a good
use case for this be something like

00:38:52.260 --> 00:38:52.270
use case for this be something like
 

00:38:52.270 --> 00:38:54.690
use case for this be something like
where your marker is like a pin it's

00:38:54.690 --> 00:38:54.700
where your marker is like a pin it's
 

00:38:54.700 --> 00:38:57.570
where your marker is like a pin it's
kind of angled and so the center point

00:38:57.570 --> 00:38:57.580
kind of angled and so the center point
 

00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:58.380
kind of angled and so the center point
of the Mokka

00:38:58.380 --> 00:38:58.390
of the Mokka
 

00:38:58.390 --> 00:39:00.540
of the Mokka
isn't actually the you know the point

00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:00.550
isn't actually the you know the point
 

00:39:00.550 --> 00:39:02.430
isn't actually the you know the point
that touches the ground and so if you

00:39:02.430 --> 00:39:02.440
that touches the ground and so if you
 

00:39:02.440 --> 00:39:05.790
that touches the ground and so if you
set the position to be that marker you

00:39:05.790 --> 00:39:05.800
set the position to be that marker you
 

00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:07.140
set the position to be that marker you
would have put the center point rather

00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:07.150
would have put the center point rather
 

00:39:07.150 --> 00:39:08.730
would have put the center point rather
in the bottom right corner if it was a

00:39:08.730 --> 00:39:08.740
in the bottom right corner if it was a
 

00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.090
in the bottom right corner if it was a
pin for example exactly yeah like you I

00:39:12.090 --> 00:39:12.100
pin for example exactly yeah like you I
 

00:39:12.100 --> 00:39:14.880
pin for example exactly yeah like you I
think the classic the classic marker is

00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:14.890
think the classic the classic marker is
 

00:39:14.890 --> 00:39:17.010
think the classic the classic marker is
actually the pin and generally it's

00:39:17.010 --> 00:39:17.020
actually the pin and generally it's
 

00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:19.200
actually the pin and generally it's
positioned so the pin point is at the

00:39:19.200 --> 00:39:19.210
positioned so the pin point is at the
 

00:39:19.210 --> 00:39:21.900
positioned so the pin point is at the
bottom left of the right the bottom left

00:39:21.900 --> 00:39:21.910
bottom left of the right the bottom left
 

00:39:21.910 --> 00:39:23.730
bottom left of the right the bottom left
of the image yeah so in that case you'd

00:39:23.730 --> 00:39:23.740
of the image yeah so in that case you'd
 

00:39:23.740 --> 00:39:25.320
of the image yeah so in that case you'd
actually have to specify an anchor and

00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:25.330
actually have to specify an anchor and
 

00:39:25.330 --> 00:39:30.120
actually have to specify an anchor and
the anchor would be 0 1 because you're

00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:30.130
the anchor would be 0 1 because you're
 

00:39:30.130 --> 00:39:32.850
the anchor would be 0 1 because you're
your zero percentage along the x-axis

00:39:32.850 --> 00:39:32.860
your zero percentage along the x-axis
 

00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:36.090
your zero percentage along the x-axis
and 100% along the the y-axis because

00:39:36.090 --> 00:39:36.100
and 100% along the the y-axis because
 

00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:38.270
and 100% along the the y-axis because
the origin is the top left of the image

00:39:38.270 --> 00:39:38.280
the origin is the top left of the image
 

00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:41.670
the origin is the top left of the image
so so for the default marker it's going

00:39:41.670 --> 00:39:41.680
so so for the default marker it's going
 

00:39:41.680 --> 00:39:43.470
so so for the default marker it's going
to be point five one because it's the

00:39:43.470 --> 00:39:43.480
to be point five one because it's the
 

00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:45.960
to be point five one because it's the
bottom center or end I'm sorry the

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:45.970
bottom center or end I'm sorry the
 

00:39:45.970 --> 00:39:49.770
bottom center or end I'm sorry the
center bottom and for the case where you

00:39:49.770 --> 00:39:49.780
center bottom and for the case where you
 

00:39:49.780 --> 00:39:52.470
center bottom and for the case where you
have the the push pin is going to be V

00:39:52.470 --> 00:39:52.480
have the the push pin is going to be V
 

00:39:52.480 --> 00:39:55.380
have the the push pin is going to be V
zero one corrector so just based in

00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:55.390
zero one corrector so just based in
 

00:39:55.390 --> 00:39:59.130
zero one corrector so just based in
percentage points and marker events so I

00:39:59.130 --> 00:39:59.140
percentage points and marker events so I
 

00:39:59.140 --> 00:40:00.690
percentage points and marker events so I
definitely should have covered map

00:40:00.690 --> 00:40:00.700
definitely should have covered map
 

00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:02.730
definitely should have covered map
events but maybe we can talk about those

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:02.740
events but maybe we can talk about those
 

00:40:02.740 --> 00:40:04.530
events but maybe we can talk about those
marker events are actually really

00:40:04.530 --> 00:40:04.540
marker events are actually really
 

00:40:04.540 --> 00:40:06.150
marker events are actually really
important because it's the way that

00:40:06.150 --> 00:40:06.160
important because it's the way that
 

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:07.690
important because it's the way that
users actually interact

00:40:07.690 --> 00:40:07.700
users actually interact
 

00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:10.000
users actually interact
you're with your pinpoints or your

00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:10.010
you're with your pinpoints or your
 

00:40:10.010 --> 00:40:15.130
you're with your pinpoints or your
markers on your map so so the so by

00:40:15.130 --> 00:40:15.140
markers on your map so so the so by
 

00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.260
markers on your map so so the so by
default there they're actually people

00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:17.270
default there they're actually people
 

00:40:17.270 --> 00:40:19.030
default there they're actually people
can click our users can can actually

00:40:19.030 --> 00:40:19.040
can click our users can can actually
 

00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.339
can click our users can can actually
touch the icons if you have an info

00:40:21.339 --> 00:40:21.349
touch the icons if you have an info
 

00:40:21.349 --> 00:40:23.020
touch the icons if you have an info
window the default behavior is the info

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:23.030
window the default behavior is the info
 

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:26.349
window the default behavior is the info
window is displayed and users can

00:40:26.349 --> 00:40:26.359
window is displayed and users can
 

00:40:26.359 --> 00:40:28.240
window is displayed and users can
actually touch the info window so this

00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:28.250
actually touch the info window so this
 

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:30.069
actually touch the info window so this
would be these cases let's say you're

00:40:30.069 --> 00:40:30.079
would be these cases let's say you're
 

00:40:30.079 --> 00:40:31.870
would be these cases let's say you're
plotting you don't want to show all the

00:40:31.870 --> 00:40:31.880
plotting you don't want to show all the
 

00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:33.460
plotting you don't want to show all the
restaurants in a particular city you can

00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:33.470
restaurants in a particular city you can
 

00:40:33.470 --> 00:40:34.990
restaurants in a particular city you can
put markers on the map for all the

00:40:34.990 --> 00:40:35.000
put markers on the map for all the
 

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.720
put markers on the map for all the
restaurants these you can press the the

00:40:37.720 --> 00:40:37.730
restaurants these you can press the the
 

00:40:37.730 --> 00:40:39.160
restaurants these you can press the the
marker to actually see the info window

00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:39.170
marker to actually see the info window
 

00:40:39.170 --> 00:40:41.050
marker to actually see the info window
which would be let's say the restaurant

00:40:41.050 --> 00:40:41.060
which would be let's say the restaurant
 

00:40:41.060 --> 00:40:43.180
which would be let's say the restaurant
name and if the user touches the info

00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:43.190
name and if the user touches the info
 

00:40:43.190 --> 00:40:44.470
name and if the user touches the info
window that can take them to a details

00:40:44.470 --> 00:40:44.480
window that can take them to a details
 

00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.220
window that can take them to a details
page so so that's kind of the the

00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:48.230
page so so that's kind of the the
 

00:40:48.230 --> 00:40:50.650
page so so that's kind of the the
rationale behind things like the the

00:40:50.650 --> 00:40:50.660
rationale behind things like the the
 

00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.630
rationale behind things like the the
marker the on marker click listener

00:40:52.630 --> 00:40:52.640
marker the on marker click listener
 

00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:53.829
marker the on marker click listener
because you know when the user clicked

00:40:53.829 --> 00:40:53.839
because you know when the user clicked
 

00:40:53.839 --> 00:40:56.980
because you know when the user clicked
the marker the on window click listener

00:40:56.980 --> 00:40:56.990
the marker the on window click listener
 

00:40:56.990 --> 00:40:58.030
the marker the on window click listener
because you know when the user actually

00:40:58.030 --> 00:40:58.040
because you know when the user actually
 

00:40:58.040 --> 00:41:01.420
because you know when the user actually
clicked the the info window and then

00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:01.430
clicked the the info window and then
 

00:41:01.430 --> 00:41:02.920
clicked the the info window and then
marker drag because like we showed

00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:02.930
marker drag because like we showed
 

00:41:02.930 --> 00:41:04.480
marker drag because like we showed
before users can actually move the mark

00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:04.490
before users can actually move the mark
 

00:41:04.490 --> 00:41:07.060
before users can actually move the mark
around the map there's also a marker

00:41:07.060 --> 00:41:07.070
around the map there's also a marker
 

00:41:07.070 --> 00:41:09.310
around the map there's also a marker
drag listener as well so the way that

00:41:09.310 --> 00:41:09.320
drag listener as well so the way that
 

00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:11.890
drag listener as well so the way that
you actually set yourself up to receive

00:41:11.890 --> 00:41:11.900
you actually set yourself up to receive
 

00:41:11.900 --> 00:41:13.660
you actually set yourself up to receive
these events is you you define the

00:41:13.660 --> 00:41:13.670
these events is you you define the
 

00:41:13.670 --> 00:41:15.520
these events is you you define the
listeners you know any one of those

00:41:15.520 --> 00:41:15.530
listeners you know any one of those
 

00:41:15.530 --> 00:41:18.309
listeners you know any one of those
three or all three if you want you

00:41:18.309 --> 00:41:18.319
three or all three if you want you
 

00:41:18.319 --> 00:41:20.109
three or all three if you want you
register your listeners once you've

00:41:20.109 --> 00:41:20.119
register your listeners once you've
 

00:41:20.119 --> 00:41:21.400
register your listeners once you've
actually created your map you can

00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:21.410
actually created your map you can
 

00:41:21.410 --> 00:41:22.780
actually created your map you can
actually specify who your listen

00:41:22.780 --> 00:41:22.790
actually specify who your listen
 

00:41:22.790 --> 00:41:25.390
actually specify who your listen
listeners are in this case I mean the

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:25.400
listeners are in this case I mean the
 

00:41:25.400 --> 00:41:27.069
listeners are in this case I mean the
most easiest case is if you attach the

00:41:27.069 --> 00:41:27.079
most easiest case is if you attach the
 

00:41:27.079 --> 00:41:29.170
most easiest case is if you attach the
listeners to your activity and then when

00:41:29.170 --> 00:41:29.180
listeners to your activity and then when
 

00:41:29.180 --> 00:41:30.400
listeners to your activity and then when
you create the map just pass it a

00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:30.410
you create the map just pass it a
 

00:41:30.410 --> 00:41:33.220
you create the map just pass it a
reference to your activity and then once

00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:33.230
reference to your activity and then once
 

00:41:33.230 --> 00:41:35.380
reference to your activity and then once
once that's all set up you can just you

00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:35.390
once that's all set up you can just you
 

00:41:35.390 --> 00:41:37.000
once that's all set up you can just you
implement these methods in your activity

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:37.010
implement these methods in your activity
 

00:41:37.010 --> 00:41:38.440
implement these methods in your activity
or fragment you can start receiving

00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:38.450
or fragment you can start receiving
 

00:41:38.450 --> 00:41:42.040
or fragment you can start receiving
these events and do fun and interesting

00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:42.050
these events and do fun and interesting
 

00:41:42.050 --> 00:41:45.790
these events and do fun and interesting

associated with the marker drag listener

00:41:48.970 --> 00:41:48.980
associated with the marker drag listener
 

00:41:48.980 --> 00:41:51.760

info window click influence into win if

00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:51.770
info window click influence into win if
 

00:41:51.770 --> 00:41:54.280
info window click influence into win if
the window click listener and I'm marker

00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:54.290
the window click listener and I'm marker
 

00:41:54.290 --> 00:41:55.750
the window click listener and I'm marker
click as the out marker click listener

00:41:55.750 --> 00:41:55.760
click as the out marker click listener
 

00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:58.180
click as the out marker click listener
and for each of these you obviously as

00:41:58.180 --> 00:41:58.190
and for each of these you obviously as
 

00:41:58.190 --> 00:42:00.069
and for each of these you obviously as
you can see you get the the marker that

00:42:00.069 --> 00:42:00.079
you can see you get the the marker that
 

00:42:00.079 --> 00:42:03.490
you can see you get the the marker that
was touched click dragged or whatever

00:42:03.490 --> 00:42:03.500
was touched click dragged or whatever
 

00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:07.750
was touched click dragged or whatever

more advanced topics like polylines and
 

00:42:27.410 --> 00:42:30.310
more advanced topics like polylines and
so on but we've got some really cool

00:42:30.310 --> 00:42:30.320
so on but we've got some really cool
 

00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:32.770
so on but we've got some really cool
stuff coming up around in and around the

stuff coming up around in and around the
 

00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.430
stuff coming up around in and around the
the API so with that being said let us

00:42:36.430 --> 00:42:36.440
the API so with that being said let us
 

00:42:36.440 --> 00:42:45.670
the API so with that being said let us
move on to Q&amp;A we got a couple questions

from Linden on in the chat window so
 

00:42:48.740 --> 00:42:51.850
from Linden on in the chat window so
maybe we can take a look at them awesome

00:42:51.850 --> 00:42:51.860
maybe we can take a look at them awesome

first question to you guys so the first
 

00:43:06.920 --> 00:43:10.690
first question to you guys so the first
question was any chance we can access

00:43:10.690 --> 00:43:10.700
question was any chance we can access
 

00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:14.200
question was any chance we can access
the frame buffer for Google Maps to grab

00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:14.210
the frame buffer for Google Maps to grab
 

00:43:14.210 --> 00:43:17.260
the frame buffer for Google Maps to grab
a bitmap well it was possible with map

00:43:17.260 --> 00:43:17.270
a bitmap well it was possible with map
 

00:43:17.270 --> 00:43:19.450
a bitmap well it was possible with map
view button1 and of course it booked a

00:43:19.450 --> 00:43:19.460
view button1 and of course it booked a
 

00:43:19.460 --> 00:43:21.610
view button1 and of course it booked a
feature I had just intamin with the old

00:43:21.610 --> 00:43:21.620
feature I had just intamin with the old
 

00:43:21.620 --> 00:43:24.130
feature I had just intamin with the old
API so there so that's the first

00:43:24.130 --> 00:43:24.140
API so there so that's the first
 

00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.620
API so there so that's the first
question I don't believe it's possible

00:43:26.620 --> 00:43:26.630
question I don't believe it's possible
 

00:43:26.630 --> 00:43:29.230
question I don't believe it's possible
right now to do it this this API does

00:43:29.230 --> 00:43:29.240
right now to do it this this API does
 

00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:31.320
right now to do it this this API does
not allow you to grab the frame buffer

00:43:31.320 --> 00:43:31.330
not allow you to grab the frame buffer
 

00:43:31.330 --> 00:43:33.730
not allow you to grab the frame buffer
but it's something that I can take back

00:43:33.730 --> 00:43:33.740
but it's something that I can take back
 

00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.870
but it's something that I can take back
to the the team just out of interest

00:43:37.870 --> 00:43:37.880
to the the team just out of interest
 

00:43:37.880 --> 00:43:40.960
to the the team just out of interest
Linden if you're still on just what are

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:40.970
Linden if you're still on just what are
 

00:43:40.970 --> 00:43:43.000
Linden if you're still on just what are
you use cases it'll just help us explain

00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:43.010
you use cases it'll just help us explain
 

00:43:43.010 --> 00:43:44.260
you use cases it'll just help us explain
it better to the engineering team

00:43:44.260 --> 00:43:44.270
it better to the engineering team
 

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:50.110
it better to the engineering team
I think Linden a bit shy today he's good

00:43:50.110 --> 00:43:50.120
I think Linden a bit shy today he's good
 

00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:56.020
I think Linden a bit shy today he's good
is sharing an image so it's an image

00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:56.030
is sharing an image so it's an image
 

00:43:56.030 --> 00:43:57.760
is sharing an image so it's an image
that you're actually taking of your app

00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:57.770
that you're actually taking of your app
 

00:43:57.770 --> 00:44:06.760
that you're actually taking of your app
like a screen shot close to it okay look

00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:06.770
like a screen shot close to it okay look
 

00:44:06.770 --> 00:44:08.860
like a screen shot close to it okay look
it's not there right now let me let me

00:44:08.860 --> 00:44:08.870
it's not there right now let me let me
 

00:44:08.870 --> 00:44:10.540
it's not there right now let me let me
talk it over with the team there may be

00:44:10.540 --> 00:44:10.550
talk it over with the team there may be
 

00:44:10.550 --> 00:44:13.330
talk it over with the team there may be
a reason that we didn't do that and

00:44:13.330 --> 00:44:13.340
a reason that we didn't do that and
 

00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:15.400
a reason that we didn't do that and
we'll get back to you I mean there there

00:44:15.400 --> 00:44:15.410
we'll get back to you I mean there there
 

00:44:15.410 --> 00:44:17.680
we'll get back to you I mean there there
is I mean one potential alternative is

00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:17.690
is I mean one potential alternative is
 

00:44:17.690 --> 00:44:20.800
is I mean one potential alternative is
if if you just want a snapshot of the

00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:20.810
if if you just want a snapshot of the
 

00:44:20.810 --> 00:44:24.300
if if you just want a snapshot of the
map is there there is the there is the

00:44:24.300 --> 00:44:24.310
map is there there is the there is the
 

00:44:24.310 --> 00:44:30.340
map is there there is the there is the
web label Maps static image API so so

00:44:30.340 --> 00:44:30.350
web label Maps static image API so so
 

00:44:30.350 --> 00:44:34.790
web label Maps static image API so so
that's also doesn't do it

00:44:34.790 --> 00:44:34.800
that's also doesn't do it
 

00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:38.930
that's also doesn't do it
so so yeah so if that the you should

00:44:38.930 --> 00:44:38.940
so so yeah so if that the you should
 

00:44:38.940 --> 00:44:40.700
so so yeah so if that the you should
essentially get the exact same

00:44:40.700 --> 00:44:40.710
essentially get the exact same
 

00:44:40.710 --> 00:44:42.470
essentially get the exact same
information back if you could you know

00:44:42.470 --> 00:44:42.480
information back if you could you know
 

00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.360
information back if you could you know
specify the bounding box birth or what

00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:44.370
specify the bounding box birth or what
 

00:44:44.370 --> 00:44:45.830
specify the bounding box birth or what
you want to get from the static image

00:44:45.830 --> 00:44:45.840
you want to get from the static image
 

00:44:45.840 --> 00:44:50.570
you want to get from the static image
API so yes static maps before work on

00:44:50.570 --> 00:44:50.580
API so yes static maps before work on
 

00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.550
API so yes static maps before work on
yeah so for now you'll have to do that

00:44:52.550 --> 00:44:52.560
yeah so for now you'll have to do that
 

00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.080
yeah so for now you'll have to do that
but obviously that wouldn't cater for if

00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:54.090
but obviously that wouldn't cater for if
 

00:44:54.090 --> 00:44:57.170
but obviously that wouldn't cater for if
you've got like custom markers exactly

00:44:57.170 --> 00:44:57.180
you've got like custom markers exactly
 

00:44:57.180 --> 00:44:58.760
you've got like custom markers exactly
like that so if you're doing Android

00:44:58.760 --> 00:44:58.770
like that so if you're doing Android
 

00:44:58.770 --> 00:45:01.940
like that so if you're doing Android
very Android centric things yeah and you

00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:01.950
very Android centric things yeah and you
 

00:45:01.950 --> 00:45:04.910
very Android centric things yeah and you
know there is so so generally direct

00:45:04.910 --> 00:45:04.920
know there is so so generally direct
 

00:45:04.920 --> 00:45:07.040
know there is so so generally direct
direct I'll access flow is what we call

00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:07.050
direct I'll access flow is what we call
 

00:45:07.050 --> 00:45:09.200
direct I'll access flow is what we call
it are actually extracting the the map

00:45:09.200 --> 00:45:09.210
it are actually extracting the the map
 

00:45:09.210 --> 00:45:12.530
it are actually extracting the the map
information out we generally shun that

00:45:12.530 --> 00:45:12.540
information out we generally shun that
 

00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.020
information out we generally shun that
it actually violates our Terms but which

00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:15.030
it actually violates our Terms but which
 

00:45:15.030 --> 00:45:16.520
it actually violates our Terms but which
is why we had things like the static map

00:45:16.520 --> 00:45:16.530
is why we had things like the static map
 

00:45:16.530 --> 00:45:20.150
is why we had things like the static map
API but well yeah I mean I think it's

00:45:20.150 --> 00:45:20.160
API but well yeah I mean I think it's
 

00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:21.560
API but well yeah I mean I think it's
definitely worth you know talking with

00:45:21.560 --> 00:45:21.570
definitely worth you know talking with
 

00:45:21.570 --> 00:45:23.090
definitely worth you know talking with
the engineering team let's see what kind

00:45:23.090 --> 00:45:23.100
the engineering team let's see what kind
 

00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:25.400
the engineering team let's see what kind
of use cases we we can support around

00:45:25.400 --> 00:45:25.410
of use cases we we can support around
 

00:45:25.410 --> 00:45:28.810
of use cases we we can support around
this because definitely it is nice to

00:45:28.810 --> 00:45:28.820
this because definitely it is nice to
 

00:45:28.820 --> 00:45:34.520
this because definitely it is nice to
you know share your rings yeah okay

00:45:34.520 --> 00:45:34.530
you know share your rings yeah okay
 

00:45:34.530 --> 00:45:38.000
you know share your rings yeah okay
next question penny you want to just

00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:38.010
next question penny you want to just
 

00:45:38.010 --> 00:45:40.250
next question penny you want to just
read them out for us yeah sure so the

00:45:40.250 --> 00:45:40.260
read them out for us yeah sure so the
 

00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.020
read them out for us yeah sure so the
next question it is it possible to

00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:42.030
next question it is it possible to
 

00:45:42.030 --> 00:45:44.590
next question it is it possible to
overlay another OpenGL view that is

00:45:44.590 --> 00:45:44.600
overlay another OpenGL view that is
 

00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:47.420
overlay another OpenGL view that is
transparent background on top of google

00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:47.430
transparent background on top of google
 

00:45:47.430 --> 00:45:53.170
transparent background on top of google
map is that what ingress is do it I

00:45:53.170 --> 00:45:53.180
map is that what ingress is do it I
 

00:45:53.180 --> 00:45:57.400
map is that what ingress is do it I
think ingress is doing something special

00:45:57.400 --> 00:45:57.410
think ingress is doing something special
 

00:45:57.410 --> 00:45:59.690
think ingress is doing something special
yeah so we can't talk about what ingress

00:45:59.690 --> 00:45:59.700
yeah so we can't talk about what ingress
 

00:45:59.700 --> 00:46:01.130
yeah so we can't talk about what ingress
is doing but I think ingress of doing

00:46:01.130 --> 00:46:01.140
is doing but I think ingress of doing
 

00:46:01.140 --> 00:46:02.870
is doing but I think ingress of doing
something special as to whether you can

00:46:02.870 --> 00:46:02.880
something special as to whether you can
 

00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.320
something special as to whether you can
do that with this library my gut feel is

00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:06.330
do that with this library my gut feel is
 

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:08.690
do that with this library my gut feel is
no because I believe we render directly

00:46:08.690 --> 00:46:08.700
no because I believe we render directly
 

00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:12.230
no because I believe we render directly
to the surface and there will be some

00:46:12.230 --> 00:46:12.240
to the surface and there will be some
 

00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:14.240
to the surface and there will be some
complications around that so yeah I'm

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:14.250
complications around that so yeah I'm
 

00:46:14.250 --> 00:46:18.370
complications around that so yeah I'm
pretty sure the answer is no linden

00:46:18.370 --> 00:46:18.380
 

00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:23.630
enlightened actually I'm not I'm on the

00:46:23.630 --> 00:46:23.640
enlightened actually I'm not I'm on the
 

00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:31.310
enlightened actually I'm not I'm on the
resistance side okay was there any other

00:46:31.310 --> 00:46:31.320
resistance side okay was there any other
 

00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:37.160
resistance side okay was there any other
questions from Linden in the meanwhile

00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:37.170
questions from Linden in the meanwhile
 

00:46:37.170 --> 00:46:41.750
questions from Linden in the meanwhile
whilst he whilst he asked those

00:46:41.750 --> 00:46:41.760
whilst he whilst he asked those
 

00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.220
whilst he whilst he asked those
questions I'll just bring up some

00:46:43.220 --> 00:46:43.230
questions I'll just bring up some
 

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:45.680
questions I'll just bring up some
questions that Andrew asked before he

00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:45.690
questions that Andrew asked before he
 

00:46:45.690 --> 00:46:46.579
questions that Andrew asked before he

said I haven't had a chance I said this

00:46:47.989 --> 00:46:47.999
said I haven't had a chance I said this
 

00:46:47.999 --> 00:46:50.180

is on the moderator page I haven't had a

00:46:50.180 --> 00:46:50.190
is on the moderator page I haven't had a
 

00:46:50.190 --> 00:46:53.450
is on the moderator page I haven't had a
chance to look at the new v2 maps and

00:46:53.450 --> 00:46:53.460
chance to look at the new v2 maps and
 

00:46:53.460 --> 00:46:56.569
chance to look at the new v2 maps and
I've been leaning to I'm just waiting

00:46:56.569 --> 00:46:56.579
I've been leaning to I'm just waiting
 

00:46:56.579 --> 00:47:02.930
I've been leaning to I'm just waiting
for a refresh the bad but does this mean

00:47:02.930 --> 00:47:02.940
for a refresh the bad but does this mean
 

00:47:02.940 --> 00:47:04.700
for a refresh the bad but does this mean
I don't have to use the users library

00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:04.710
I don't have to use the users library
 

00:47:04.710 --> 00:47:10.910
I don't have to use the users library
tag anymore does this also mean I don't

00:47:10.910 --> 00:47:10.920
tag anymore does this also mean I don't
 

00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:13.400
tag anymore does this also mean I don't
need to use the Google API checkbox in

00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:13.410
need to use the Google API checkbox in
 

00:47:13.410 --> 00:47:15.109
need to use the Google API checkbox in
the Eclipse plugin to support Google

00:47:15.109 --> 00:47:15.119
the Eclipse plugin to support Google
 

00:47:15.119 --> 00:47:18.109
the Eclipse plugin to support Google
Maps so using this library we no longer

00:47:18.109 --> 00:47:18.119
Maps so using this library we no longer
 

00:47:18.119 --> 00:47:21.410
Maps so using this library we no longer
need that yeah so so the process now is

00:47:21.410 --> 00:47:21.420
need that yeah so so the process now is
 

00:47:21.420 --> 00:47:24.140
need that yeah so so the process now is
that you use the library project so in

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.150
that you use the library project so in
 

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:27.259
that you use the library project so in
Android so and that's the the Google

00:47:27.259 --> 00:47:27.269
Android so and that's the the Google
 

00:47:27.269 --> 00:47:30.559
Android so and that's the the Google
Play services library project yeah and

00:47:30.559 --> 00:47:30.569
Play services library project yeah and
 

00:47:30.569 --> 00:47:33.650
Play services library project yeah and
the so for the checkbox however for the

00:47:33.650 --> 00:47:33.660
the so for the checkbox however for the
 

00:47:33.660 --> 00:47:35.809
the so for the checkbox however for the
Google API is in so when he says Eclipse

00:47:35.809 --> 00:47:35.819
Google API is in so when he says Eclipse
 

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:37.039
Google API is in so when he says Eclipse
plug-in I think what he's talking about

00:47:37.039 --> 00:47:37.049
plug-in I think what he's talking about
 

00:47:37.049 --> 00:47:40.099
plug-in I think what he's talking about
is the AVD manager the Android virtual

00:47:40.099 --> 00:47:40.109
is the AVD manager the Android virtual
 

00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:43.160
is the AVD manager the Android virtual
device manager you definitely do need to

00:47:43.160 --> 00:47:43.170
device manager you definitely do need to
 

00:47:43.170 --> 00:47:48.380
device manager you definitely do need to
use the Google API it's image because

00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:48.390
use the Google API it's image because
 

00:47:48.390 --> 00:47:51.229
use the Google API it's image because
this is part of Google well the Maps API

00:47:51.229 --> 00:47:51.239
this is part of Google well the Maps API
 

00:47:51.239 --> 00:47:52.789
this is part of Google well the Maps API
is part of Google Play services which

00:47:52.789 --> 00:47:52.799
is part of Google Play services which
 

00:47:52.799 --> 00:47:56.529
is part of Google Play services which
