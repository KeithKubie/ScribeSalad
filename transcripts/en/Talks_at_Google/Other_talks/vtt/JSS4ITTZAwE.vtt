00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:05.120
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
everybody for coming,

00:00:05.120 --> 00:00:07.650
despite there being a
Spain/Netherlands match

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:08.750
in an hour.

00:00:08.750 --> 00:00:12.420
So that's really brave
of you to come here.

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:16.560
And I don't know how many of you
were there for the last year's

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.710
talk by Radhanath
Swami, here at Google.

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:22.465
OK, just one.

00:00:22.465 --> 00:00:26.510
So I don't know if you
heard about this book.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:27.980
It's called "The Journey Home."

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:30.670
He's the author of that book.

00:00:30.670 --> 00:00:34.120
So we invited him as part of
the "Authors at Google" series

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.780
to give us some
wonderful insights

00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:42.000
he has from his life's journey.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:44.940
Actually this book, even though
it's called a autobiography,

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.470
it covers mostly two
years of his life,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:49.970
when he was a teenager.

00:00:49.970 --> 00:00:53.370
But those two years
are worth going through

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:55.680
in depth, as you
can see what goes

00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:00.230
on in the mind of a spiritual
aspirant, who was a teenager

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:03.170
and just steadfastly had
this one goal in mind,

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:04.780
to know the meaning of life.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:11.310
And then with so much passion
and integrity to himself,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:13.020
how he found that goal.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.150
And then the rest of his life
is a dedication to that goal.

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:21.290
So that's what brings him
here today for this topic

00:01:21.290 --> 00:01:25.870
on integrity or influence
without affluence,

00:01:25.870 --> 00:01:29.610
the power of integrity
and authenticity.

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.860
So basically the reason
he chose that topic

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.280
is because that's the
essence of his personality.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:39.150
I've known him for like 17
years and heard his lectures

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:40.150
and talks.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:42.720
And he's a very humble person.

00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:45.690
And the last thing
I could expect

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:48.240
is that he would write
a book about himself.

00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:53.150
Why would a monk, who is so
humble, write about himself?

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:57.990
Normally, people read books as
a ego trip or just to show off.

00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:01.080
But then the reason
he wrote this book is

00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:05.360
to show how one could be
successful if one first

00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:11.280
used one's own calling of the
heart despite all obstacles

00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.580
and remain committed
to that goal.

00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:15.810
So that's the real
essence of his being.

00:02:15.810 --> 00:02:18.330
And the book here,
"Journey Home,"

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:20.852
there's a bunch of
copies available

00:02:20.852 --> 00:02:21.810
at the subsidized rate.

00:02:21.810 --> 00:02:25.310
So you can pick up
one when you go.

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:29.300
And then we also have this
program called "Atma."

00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:31.400
They have some flyers out there.

00:02:31.400 --> 00:02:33.430
So this, of course, is
on the "Bhagavad Gita."

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.327
Some of us are doing here.

00:02:35.327 --> 00:02:37.410
We are doing these talks
as part of these courses.

00:02:37.410 --> 00:02:40.680
So if you're interested, you
can pick up one of the flyer

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:41.500
or go to go/atma.

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.630
So with that, give
a warm welcome

00:02:47.630 --> 00:02:50.333
to Radhanath Swami for Google.

00:02:50.333 --> 00:02:52.297
[APPLAUSE]

00:03:04.081 --> 00:03:08.510
RADHANATH SWAMI: [CHANT]

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.490
It is my great honor and joy
to be with all of you today

00:04:42.490 --> 00:04:47.850
at this most
important place that

00:04:47.850 --> 00:04:52.760
affects the whole world in
every moment, the headquarters

00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:53.300
of Google.

00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:05.613
With power comes a tremendous
amount of responsibility.

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:14.770
The power of wealth,
the power of knowledge,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:18.220
the power of fame,
the power of having

00:05:18.220 --> 00:05:25.760
skills, when these, from
a spiritual perspective

00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:30.180
on these blessings,
are entrusted to us,

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.960
we have a great
responsibility just

00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:38.840
beyond our own little circle
or reference of reality.

00:05:41.390 --> 00:05:46.750
Because at every moment,
our thoughts, our words,

00:05:46.750 --> 00:05:52.330
and our actions are influencing
the world, the universe,

00:05:52.330 --> 00:05:54.840
and the creation.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:58.180
If anyone knows these
subjects from a scientific,

00:05:58.180 --> 00:06:02.540
technological perspective,
it's all of you here at Google.

00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:13.030
There's a saying that you
can tell how rich you are

00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:16.570
by counting how many things
you have that money cannot buy.

00:06:21.970 --> 00:06:26.410
Recently, I was at
the House of Lords

00:06:26.410 --> 00:06:30.750
in London, in the
British parliament.

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.830
And I spoke that one little
sentence and everyone applauded

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:39.550
because everyone
there had so much.

00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:45.380
And the more you have, the more
you realize how these things

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:46.730
cannot buy us happiness.

00:06:49.490 --> 00:06:56.080
It is said in a human-evolved
society of consciousness,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:02.650
people love people
and use things.

00:07:02.650 --> 00:07:06.840
But in the world we
live, all too often

00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:12.270
people love things and
use people to get them

00:07:12.270 --> 00:07:13.170
or to keep them.

00:07:16.180 --> 00:07:21.720
There can be no inner
fulfillment in such a life.

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:26.580
The "Bhagavad Gita" tells
that real intelligence

00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:33.890
is when we find satisfaction
within ourselves.

00:07:33.890 --> 00:07:38.470
And then, instead
of desperately,

00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:44.490
passionately trying to get
stuff to give us satisfaction,

00:07:44.490 --> 00:07:48.080
we use all these
things in this world

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:50.145
to share the
satisfaction we have.

00:07:54.250 --> 00:07:55.595
That's a fulfilling life.

00:07:59.010 --> 00:08:03.190
When we have that inner
peace, that inner love,

00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:08.510
that interconnection
to grace, then it's

00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:12.732
a foundation that we can
build our whole life upon.

00:08:15.390 --> 00:08:20.480
If we build a house-- let us
take this wonderful building

00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:22.970
in the Google
headquarters, for example.

00:08:22.970 --> 00:08:24.160
It's a wonderful building.

00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:27.640
It has beautiful
architecture, and very nice,

00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:32.470
modern design, and a lot
of technologies in it.

00:08:32.470 --> 00:08:35.850
But very few people
will come and say

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:41.090
this building has a
fantastic foundation.

00:08:41.090 --> 00:08:45.640
Because foundation is not
what is seen externally.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:49.740
But the reality is the
foundation holds up everything.

00:08:49.740 --> 00:08:51.800
Without the foundation,
the whole building

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:54.960
will crumble in a time
of crisis or storm.

00:08:58.460 --> 00:09:01.470
So to have actual
happiness in this world

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:05.540
is not on the basis of
what's happening around us.

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.090
Because things are
always changing.

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.020
It's the nature of the world.

00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:13.330
Happiness, distress; honor,
dishonor; pleasure, pain;

00:09:13.330 --> 00:09:16.540
health, disease;
success, failure;

00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:22.949
victory, defeat, like two sides
of a coin, these dualities

00:09:22.949 --> 00:09:23.615
are inseparable.

00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:31.030
And if our happiness
is dependent on getting

00:09:31.030 --> 00:09:35.160
the side of the
coin that we prefer,

00:09:35.160 --> 00:09:42.260
then it's very tottering--
but if we can find happiness

00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:43.015
beyond that.

00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:48.030
I sometimes tell a story.

00:09:48.030 --> 00:09:49.770
It's in this book.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:54.780
I was sitting on the back
of the Ganges River one day.

00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:59.660
It was summer, the
month of May in India.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:04.840
It was probably 120 degrees,
with not a single cloud

00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:06.920
in the sky.

00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:09.970
And no one-- even though
this was a very holy place,

00:10:09.970 --> 00:10:12.370
the place where the
Ganges, and the Yamuna,

00:10:12.370 --> 00:10:15.480
and Saraswati, three rivers
meet, because of the heat,

00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:18.480
one was there except me.

00:10:18.480 --> 00:10:20.190
If you go there
during Kumbhmela,

00:10:20.190 --> 00:10:23.500
which I did last
year, on one day

00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:27.980
there was 25 million people
in that spot, all trying

00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.525
to bathe at the same
time, in the same place.

00:10:33.770 --> 00:10:35.970
So there's a price
to pay, the heat,

00:10:35.970 --> 00:10:37.880
that I had it all for myself.

00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.230
[LAUGHTER]

00:10:39.230 --> 00:10:44.380
And as I was sitting
there, I saw a hawk

00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:46.742
hovering down in the sky.

00:10:46.742 --> 00:10:51.256
He had long, extended
wings, brown, golden-white.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:11:00.970
And I saw his yellow eyes
intensely gazing down

00:11:00.970 --> 00:11:02.570
into the river.

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.920
He was circling,
lower, lower, lower,

00:11:07.920 --> 00:11:11.685
until he was just a
few feet above my head.

00:11:11.685 --> 00:11:18.220
And I saw his pointed
beak and very sharp claws.

00:11:18.220 --> 00:11:22.560
And he looked hungry.

00:11:22.560 --> 00:11:25.820
And I looked like the only
piece of meat around actually.

00:11:25.820 --> 00:11:31.270
[LAUGHTER] So I was quite
awake in my meditation.

00:11:31.270 --> 00:11:33.010
[LAUGHTER]

00:11:33.010 --> 00:11:38.080
Suddenly, [EXPLOSION], he
dove right into the water,

00:11:38.080 --> 00:11:39.030
head first.

00:11:39.030 --> 00:11:40.600
He went underwater.

00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:43.372
And [SPLASHING] the
water was-- there

00:11:43.372 --> 00:11:45.570
was something going on
under there, a splashing,

00:11:45.570 --> 00:11:47.990
and splashing, and splashing.

00:11:47.990 --> 00:11:52.430
Then the hawk emerged
from under the water.

00:11:52.430 --> 00:12:00.315
And in his claws was a
fish, about one foot long.

00:12:03.380 --> 00:12:06.590
It was only a few
feet away from me.

00:12:06.590 --> 00:12:10.186
I could look right into
that little fish's eyes.

00:12:10.186 --> 00:12:12.120
He was flapping desperately.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.855
Maybe it was a
she, I don't know.

00:12:14.855 --> 00:12:16.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:23.960
But that fish eyes look
totally shocked, disoriented,

00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:24.740
and desperate.

00:12:27.590 --> 00:12:30.790
And as the hawk was taking him
higher and higher into the air,

00:12:30.790 --> 00:12:35.310
I was thinking that fish
was probably just having

00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.740
a regular old day,
like the rest of us.

00:12:38.740 --> 00:12:42.300
He was swimming around with his
friends and with his relatives,

00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.450
and looking for some food,
and finding food, and playing,

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:48.610
and swimming upstream, and
downstream, and across stream.

00:12:48.610 --> 00:12:53.090
And just like any
other day, enjoying

00:12:53.090 --> 00:12:59.640
the beautiful underwater
vegetation of the Ganges.

00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:06.250
And suddenly, the hawk of fate
ripped that little fish out

00:13:06.250 --> 00:13:07.145
of its complacency.

00:13:09.840 --> 00:13:14.180
And now, he was helpless
and about to die.

00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:22.410
I was just about 19 years
old when I saw this.

00:13:25.190 --> 00:13:27.830
And it was a time in my
life when I was really

00:13:27.830 --> 00:13:31.180
searching for
meaning and purpose.

00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:34.620
And every little
thing I was seeing-- I

00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:37.510
was looking for messages.

00:13:37.510 --> 00:13:41.790
And in the Bible, it says
seek and you shall find.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:45.440
Knock [KNOCKING] and
the door will open.

00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:49.820
If we're looking
for wisdom, it's

00:13:49.820 --> 00:13:52.370
revealing itself to us
everywhere and in everything.

00:13:56.010 --> 00:13:59.790
So this was a life-changing
experience for me,

00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:02.540
although we probably see
things like this every day.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:09.830
I was thinking that
that hawk of fate

00:14:09.830 --> 00:14:16.905
can shake any one of us out of
our comfort zone at any moment.

00:14:19.730 --> 00:14:21.875
That's just the nature
of life in this world.

00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:30.210
But if that fish
was swimming deeper,

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:33.500
the hawk could not reach it.

00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:37.130
And similarly, if we
find our happiness

00:14:37.130 --> 00:14:42.430
in a deep place
within ourselves,

00:14:42.430 --> 00:14:47.440
in the values, the integrity, in
the compassion that we live by,

00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:49.930
nothing could
shake the happiness

00:14:49.930 --> 00:14:52.810
because it's beyond
all the dualities

00:14:52.810 --> 00:14:54.075
and changes of the world.

00:14:57.400 --> 00:15:02.330
The world is said to be
a mirror of our own state

00:15:02.330 --> 00:15:04.610
of consciousness.

00:15:04.610 --> 00:15:09.120
No two people see the
same thing the same way.

00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:13.720
People like to be objective.

00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:21.530
But I'm about 64 years
old and in my experience,

00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:23.870
no one could really
be objective.

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:27.410
[LAUGHTER] To a
certain extent we can,

00:15:27.410 --> 00:15:29.610
but we're all seeing
through different lenses

00:15:29.610 --> 00:15:32.710
of our consciousness.

00:15:32.710 --> 00:15:35.860
When the Sun rises,
even in our own life,

00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:38.420
every day we're seeing a
different kind of sunrise.

00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:40.100
It's the same Sun planet.

00:15:40.100 --> 00:15:44.570
But depending on our
mood, one day we wake up

00:15:44.570 --> 00:15:46.700
and we see the
sunrise and we think,

00:15:46.700 --> 00:15:49.010
god, another day
I have to struggle

00:15:49.010 --> 00:15:50.540
with this problem
and that problem.

00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:54.140
I wish I could just go to sleep
or just take some intoxication

00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:56.070
and forget who I am.

00:15:56.070 --> 00:15:57.020
Yes.

00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:59.305
And another day we see
the Sun and we think,

00:15:59.305 --> 00:16:00.866
oh, so many opportunities.

00:16:00.866 --> 00:16:01.990
I'm going to do this today.

00:16:01.990 --> 00:16:03.400
I'm going to do that today.

00:16:03.400 --> 00:16:06.020
And another day we see
the Sun, and we think, oh,

00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:09.950
how beautiful nature is.

00:16:09.950 --> 00:16:13.330
So everyone is seeing
in different ways

00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.020
at every moment,
what to speak of,

00:16:15.020 --> 00:16:16.853
different people with
different experiences.

00:16:19.760 --> 00:16:22.540
It's like I just coming
into the Google headquarters

00:16:22.540 --> 00:16:26.490
and I saw these
beautiful flowers.

00:16:26.490 --> 00:16:28.710
And at the beginning,
I was thinking, oh,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:31.470
how nice these flowers.

00:16:31.470 --> 00:16:36.030
And I was thinking I'd
like to take this flower

00:16:36.030 --> 00:16:40.010
and offer it to my beloved lord.

00:16:40.010 --> 00:16:44.590
And then, I started
getting some kind

00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.630
of experience of hay fever.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:52.689
[LAUGHTER] And I was seeing the
flower in a very different way.

00:16:52.689 --> 00:16:54.730
I was saying I want to
get away from that flower.

00:16:54.730 --> 00:16:56.569
I wish this flower didn't exist.

00:16:56.569 --> 00:16:58.110
It's going to make
me sneeze and then

00:16:58.110 --> 00:16:59.920
I'm going to be sneezing
during the lecture

00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:01.514
and everything like that.

00:17:01.514 --> 00:17:03.910
[LAUGHTER]

00:17:03.910 --> 00:17:07.110
So things are so relative
and we are so subjective.

00:17:09.722 --> 00:17:13.810
And in a certain way, we
should try to be objective.

00:17:13.810 --> 00:17:17.430
But we are subjective.

00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:20.500
We're all seeing
the world according

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:25.359
to the lens of our values,
of our particular attitude,

00:17:25.359 --> 00:17:28.990
of what we're striving to
achieve in life, and of all

00:17:28.990 --> 00:17:31.100
of our past experiences in life.

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:43.300
For some people, when they see
a drug addict, it's despicable.

00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.800
For another person when
they see a drug addict,

00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.960
they have such deep,
deep compassion.

00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:50.290
They'll do anything for
that person to help them out

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:54.170
because they've been
through it themselves.

00:17:54.170 --> 00:17:57.040
So what is the reality?

00:17:57.040 --> 00:18:00.540
The reality is a truth.

00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:07.900
But how we respond to it
becomes our inner reality.

00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:11.810
And in this sense, the
Vedas, and particularly

00:18:11.810 --> 00:18:19.870
the "Bhagavad Gita," explain
how we can subjectively

00:18:19.870 --> 00:18:24.934
transform our objective
experiences in this world

00:18:24.934 --> 00:18:29.180
by understanding some
basic principles of how

00:18:29.180 --> 00:18:30.105
the world works.

00:18:33.790 --> 00:18:34.800
There it is explained.

00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.540
There are three gunas or
three modes of nature.

00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:45.430
And these modes,
they're like colors.

00:18:45.430 --> 00:18:48.030
And different
combinations of colors

00:18:48.030 --> 00:18:50.420
create so many other colors.

00:18:50.420 --> 00:18:58.300
But they're basic principles
of material creation

00:18:58.300 --> 00:19:01.270
that influence
literally everything

00:19:01.270 --> 00:19:06.019
within the creation-- like that.

00:19:06.019 --> 00:19:08.002
Thank you, thank you.

00:19:15.500 --> 00:19:20.740
Sometimes that helps
keep people alert.

00:19:20.740 --> 00:19:21.770
I didn't mean to do it.

00:19:21.770 --> 00:19:23.715
But still it had that effect.

00:19:23.715 --> 00:19:28.950
[LAUGHTER]

00:19:28.950 --> 00:19:35.670
There's the modes of goodness,
passion, and ignorance.

00:19:35.670 --> 00:19:41.120
And the "Bhagavad Gita"
explains how they affect us

00:19:41.120 --> 00:19:46.620
and how actually we come under
the influence of these modes

00:19:46.620 --> 00:19:52.130
according to the choices
that we make in our lives.

00:19:52.130 --> 00:20:01.200
When we make those choices,
then we acquire those qualities.

00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:04.980
And then we become more inclined
to make those same choices

00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:07.730
again, and again,
and again, and again.

00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:11.150
But still we have
free will to come

00:20:11.150 --> 00:20:15.950
to a higher aspiration
and attitude in life.

00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.270
Let us take an example
of the gita of charity.

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:27.140
The "Bhagavad Gita" says
charity in the mode of goodness

00:20:27.140 --> 00:20:31.550
is giving the right people the
right thing, at the right time,

00:20:31.550 --> 00:20:33.625
in the right place,
so everyone benefits.

00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:40.660
Charity in the mode of passion
is to give something to someone

00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:47.530
so that I get tax breaks and
I get fame and popularity

00:20:47.530 --> 00:20:50.890
by giving to somebody else.

00:20:50.890 --> 00:20:54.930
Charity in the mode of ignorance
is giving the wrong thing

00:20:54.930 --> 00:20:58.190
to the wrong person, at the
wrong time, in the wrong place,

00:20:58.190 --> 00:21:00.115
in such a way that
it's actually harmful.

00:21:05.110 --> 00:21:08.980
Our disposition in life--
let us take, for example,

00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:16.390
our occupation-- how
the choices we make

00:21:16.390 --> 00:21:20.620
affect our relationships
with other people

00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.540
and with the environment
around us, which

00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.335
is a very, very important
concern in the world today.

00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.010
In our work, the way
we perform our work,

00:21:36.010 --> 00:21:38.850
the way we interact
with people in our work,

00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:44.880
and the way we utilize
what we gain from our work,

00:21:44.880 --> 00:21:49.580
in the mode of goodness, we're
looking at a broad picture.

00:21:49.580 --> 00:21:52.950
We're not just seeing
the immediate thing.

00:21:52.950 --> 00:21:54.740
We all have to
focus on something

00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:56.500
immediate,
accomplishing something,

00:21:56.500 --> 00:22:00.790
a project or whatever it may be.

00:22:00.790 --> 00:22:04.290
But to see it in the
broader perspective--

00:22:04.290 --> 00:22:09.450
how am I going to do it in
a way that it's actually

00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.870
going to bring out real
inner fulfillment to me,

00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:18.990
real happiness to others, and
real prosperity for my cause.

00:22:18.990 --> 00:22:21.790
That's the mode of
goodness, to really look

00:22:21.790 --> 00:22:24.730
at the broader picture.

00:22:24.730 --> 00:22:30.300
The Vedas explain there
is preyas and sreyas.

00:22:30.300 --> 00:22:34.680
These are two types of
activities, and consciousness.

00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:39.740
Sreyas is that what
we do, what we speak,

00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:42.590
we are thinking
of how it is going

00:22:42.590 --> 00:22:46.250
to affect the overall
present and future

00:22:46.250 --> 00:22:47.265
and everyone involved.

00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:53.230
And preyas is how
it affects me now.

00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:59.010
It's like most
children, they really

00:22:59.010 --> 00:23:01.680
don't like to go to school.

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:05.270
Some children do, but I didn't.

00:23:05.270 --> 00:23:06.495
I just wanted to play.

00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:14.200
In those days, in the 1950s,
in Illinois where I grew up,

00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:17.730
we all played in empty lots.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:20.760
And we played baseball,
and soccer, and football,

00:23:20.760 --> 00:23:22.270
and all these games
in empty lots.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.220
And we could just play forever.

00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.085
And then my mother says it's
time for school-- and, ptth,

00:23:29.085 --> 00:23:30.310
what a waste of time.

00:23:34.506 --> 00:23:36.710
Now, I didn't have
the intelligence.

00:23:36.710 --> 00:23:39.880
But my mother had
the intelligence.

00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:43.860
Because you can play all day and
be happy now, but in the future

00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:47.050
your life is going to be
in destitute and misery

00:23:47.050 --> 00:23:50.360
because you're not planning.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:52.940
So going to school is sreyas.

00:23:52.940 --> 00:23:56.610
Playing all day is preyas.

00:23:56.610 --> 00:23:58.740
But this actually
applies at every stage

00:23:58.740 --> 00:24:01.740
of our life, in whatever we do.

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:05.400
The decisions we're
making, what we're doing,

00:24:05.400 --> 00:24:10.220
and how we're doing
it is going to affect

00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.630
the future quality of my life
and those people around us

00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:17.660
and the environment around us.

00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:21.270
So the mode of goodness,
or sattva guna,

00:24:21.270 --> 00:24:26.760
is to have knowledge and
to apply that knowledge,

00:24:26.760 --> 00:24:33.120
to take serious responsibility
for the spiritual, social,

00:24:33.120 --> 00:24:38.382
individual, and collective
welfare of everyone.

00:24:38.382 --> 00:24:39.590
That is the mode of goodness.

00:24:42.220 --> 00:24:46.420
The mood of passion
is more the drive

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:50.480
to accomplish something,
centered primarily

00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:56.520
around the principles
of I, me, and my,

00:24:56.520 --> 00:25:04.610
and not really considering who
I am, what values are there,

00:25:04.610 --> 00:25:07.720
or how it's going to affect the
environment or other people.

00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:13.290
And the mode of ignorance
is when the mode of passion

00:25:13.290 --> 00:25:20.290
deteriorates to the point where
our actions and our choices

00:25:20.290 --> 00:25:30.130
are insensitive to the pain of
others, where we can justify

00:25:30.130 --> 00:25:35.800
cruelty, we can justify
tearing other people down

00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:38.330
to bring myself up.

00:25:38.330 --> 00:25:42.710
We can justify destroying the
ecology and the environment

00:25:42.710 --> 00:25:45.820
for generations in
the future just so

00:25:45.820 --> 00:25:49.780
that I can accomplish
something for me now.

00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:51.010
That's the mode of ignorance.

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:58.200
Wisdom is to balance.

00:25:58.200 --> 00:26:02.200
Because all of us, we have
to act with passionate.

00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.110
We have to strive to
accomplish something.

00:26:06.110 --> 00:26:10.250
Whether we're engineers, or
scientists, or educators,

00:26:10.250 --> 00:26:14.126
or we're in business, or
investment, or politics,

00:26:14.126 --> 00:26:17.310
or whether we're
farmers, or even if we're

00:26:17.310 --> 00:26:21.710
little swamis like me, we
want to accomplish something.

00:26:21.710 --> 00:26:25.810
We need a drive
to accomplish it.

00:26:25.810 --> 00:26:32.410
Wisdom is to balance this
passion with goodness,

00:26:32.410 --> 00:26:35.620
with the vision of
a larger picture,

00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.910
with the vision of
the social/spiritual

00:26:37.910 --> 00:26:41.130
responsibilities that we
have in everything we do.

00:26:45.340 --> 00:26:50.240
If we do not balance
passion with goodness, then

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.585
by nature's own course it
will be affected by ignorance.

00:26:59.830 --> 00:27:03.910
Just like when a
river is flowing,

00:27:03.910 --> 00:27:07.590
if you don't swim upstream,
you're going to go downstream.

00:27:07.590 --> 00:27:09.800
You can't stay where you are.

00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:10.920
Yes?

00:27:10.920 --> 00:27:12.200
You ever be in a river?

00:27:12.200 --> 00:27:15.790
You can't just say, OK, I'm
just going to rest and be here.

00:27:15.790 --> 00:27:19.050
If you rest, you go [INAUDIBLE].

00:27:19.050 --> 00:27:20.940
You're either going up or down.

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:24.830
So similarly, passion either
has to be balanced with goodness

00:27:24.830 --> 00:27:26.848
or it's going to be
degraded by ignorance.

00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:40.090
And as human beings, this is
the responsibilities we have.

00:27:40.090 --> 00:27:43.120
And inner fulfillment
actually comes

00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:47.676
by making choices based on these
higher principals, these higher

00:27:47.676 --> 00:27:48.175
values.

00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.140
I was recently at a marriage.

00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.120
And they asked me to speak.

00:27:56.120 --> 00:28:00.620
[LAUGHTER] It was in Southern
California and the people

00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:03.350
getting married were lawyers.

00:28:03.350 --> 00:28:06.295
So there were all these
lawyers and judges

00:28:06.295 --> 00:28:09.840
and everyone at the marriage.

00:28:09.840 --> 00:28:13.595
So I was saying a little
prayer, what should I say?

00:28:16.870 --> 00:28:19.799
And sometimes
simple things come.

00:28:19.799 --> 00:28:21.090
And I said all kinds of things.

00:28:21.090 --> 00:28:22.650
But the one thing
they liked the best

00:28:22.650 --> 00:28:24.005
was just the personal example.

00:28:26.650 --> 00:28:27.690
My nephew is here.

00:28:27.690 --> 00:28:32.190
His name is William, his
grandmother and grandfather,

00:28:32.190 --> 00:28:35.250
who happen to be my
mother and father.

00:28:35.250 --> 00:28:39.540
When I was about
eight years old,

00:28:39.540 --> 00:28:43.820
I was just sitting on my
mother's bed, in her bedroom.

00:28:43.820 --> 00:28:45.800
And she was looking
in the mirror

00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:49.580
and putting mascara on her eyes.

00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:52.220
Because this was in the 1950s.

00:28:52.220 --> 00:28:55.910
And maybe-- I'm kind of out
of touch with these things

00:28:55.910 --> 00:28:56.936
these days.

00:28:56.936 --> 00:29:00.910
But I guess people still
put mascaras on their eyes.

00:29:00.910 --> 00:29:03.260
So she was doing that.

00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:07.340
And I was just watching.

00:29:07.340 --> 00:29:09.830
And for me, this was like
the best television show,

00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:13.780
just watching my mother
do this, something simple,

00:29:13.780 --> 00:29:16.300
because of affection.

00:29:16.300 --> 00:29:20.100
And then she turned to
me and said something

00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.240
I'll never forget.

00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:28.400
She said, everyone loves your
father and everyone loves me.

00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.380
But we don't love
each other any more

00:29:31.380 --> 00:29:32.990
and we have decided to separate.

00:29:37.870 --> 00:29:41.300
An eight-year-old
boy hearing that-- I

00:29:41.300 --> 00:29:42.730
don't know how
other people think,

00:29:42.730 --> 00:29:50.580
but it created such
a trauma in my mind.

00:29:50.580 --> 00:29:52.718
It was unimaginable.

00:29:52.718 --> 00:29:53.593
It was inconceivable.

00:29:56.705 --> 00:30:00.950
I felt so insecure, so unstable.

00:30:00.950 --> 00:30:04.100
It was as if the whole world
had just fallen away from me

00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.430
and I was just kind of
dropping into nowhere.

00:30:08.430 --> 00:30:10.120
I couldn't say a word.

00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.750
All I could do was cry.

00:30:12.750 --> 00:30:16.490
And she looked at me and
she couldn't see a word.

00:30:16.490 --> 00:30:17.720
She started to cry.

00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:20.157
And then I ran away.

00:30:20.157 --> 00:30:21.532
And she didn't
know where I went.

00:30:21.532 --> 00:30:27.580
I ran down the stairs, out
the door, down the block.

00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.870
And I just kept running.

00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:38.180
That evening when my father
came back from work--

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:41.050
and he was struggling
because at that time he was--

00:30:41.050 --> 00:30:43.890
did you ever hear of the Edsel?

00:30:43.890 --> 00:30:46.950
He owned a dealership of Edsels.

00:30:46.950 --> 00:30:51.830
So he was having many
challenges on many levels.

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:53.300
[LAUGHTER]

00:30:53.300 --> 00:31:00.770
So he came home and
came into the bedroom.

00:31:00.770 --> 00:31:05.500
And my mother and
father closed the door.

00:31:05.500 --> 00:31:07.660
And I knew what they
were going to talk about.

00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:12.634
So I secretly put
my ear to the door.

00:31:12.634 --> 00:31:13.980
Nobody knows this.

00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:23.550
And I heard my mother tell my
father what happened to me.

00:31:23.550 --> 00:31:31.810
There was total silence
for about a minute.

00:31:31.810 --> 00:31:36.892
And then I heard them say
we're going to work this out.

00:31:36.892 --> 00:31:38.100
We're going to stay together.

00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.080
We're going to work this out.

00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.440
We have a higher
purpose to achieve

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:44.470
than just our relationship
with each other.

00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:48.620
And they did.

00:31:48.620 --> 00:31:51.300
And it wasn't easy for them.

00:31:51.300 --> 00:31:56.260
But as the years
went by, I hardly

00:31:56.260 --> 00:32:03.390
saw anywhere in the world such
a loving, respectful, and united

00:32:03.390 --> 00:32:08.890
relationship between two
human beings as they had.

00:32:08.890 --> 00:32:12.120
When my mother passed away,
they were married 58 years.

00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:17.600
And when I think
of that incident,

00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.780
I think the love and the
fulfillment that they achieved,

00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:29.560
it wasn't because they were
thinking I, me, and mine.

00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:35.700
They developed a relationship
based on a higher principle

00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:39.200
that was beyond either of them.

00:32:39.200 --> 00:32:41.430
And because they
took responsibility

00:32:41.430 --> 00:32:46.220
for that higher principle,
a deeper fulfillment,

00:32:46.220 --> 00:32:52.880
a deeper love than anyone could
imagine was given to them.

00:32:57.950 --> 00:33:02.570
A couple years ago, I was with
my very dear-- my best friend,

00:33:02.570 --> 00:33:06.960
[HINDU], who is
sitting here today.

00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:11.610
He's the leader of
the Vaisnav community

00:33:11.610 --> 00:33:14.770
in this part of California.

00:33:14.770 --> 00:33:17.525
And every year, we take a
walk through the Muir Woods.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:27.400
Whatever our schedules are,
we make this a priority, just

00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:32.140
the two of us to walk
through this redwood forest

00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:36.430
and just reflect about life,
and reflect about the year that

00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:42.020
has passed, and reflect
about our future and really

00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.760
reevaluate things.

00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.490
Have any of you
been to Muir Woods?

00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:49.710
Please raise your hands.

00:33:49.710 --> 00:33:55.390
When we see those
gigantic redwood trees,

00:33:55.390 --> 00:34:01.633
it's such a natural environment
that it does something to us.

00:34:01.633 --> 00:34:07.510
[LAUGHTER] It induces
certain reflection

00:34:07.510 --> 00:34:10.330
into higher realities
beyond ourselves.

00:34:10.330 --> 00:34:15.460
One of the reasons is
these trees are so big

00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.780
and we're so small.

00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:23.699
And these trees, some of them
are 1,000 or 2,000 years old

00:34:23.699 --> 00:34:28.500
and we'll be lucky to
live 80 or 90 years.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:32.449
So when we really compare
ourselves to the trees,

00:34:32.449 --> 00:34:36.134
these trees are
quite substantial.

00:34:36.134 --> 00:34:42.280
[LAUGHTER]

00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:47.270
A few years before that, I
brought a group of teenagers

00:34:47.270 --> 00:34:52.239
to King's Canyon, where
the biggest Sequoia trees

00:34:52.239 --> 00:34:54.830
and redwood trees
in the world are.

00:34:54.830 --> 00:34:59.709
And we went to the largest
tree on planet Earth.

00:34:59.709 --> 00:35:00.875
It's called General Sherman.

00:35:03.690 --> 00:35:07.320
It's about 2,200 years old.

00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:10.090
And it's gigantic.

00:35:10.090 --> 00:35:13.310
If you hollowed it out
and put water in it,

00:35:13.310 --> 00:35:17.510
I think you could have enough
water for a family of four

00:35:17.510 --> 00:35:20.740
to take a bath for 12 years.

00:35:20.740 --> 00:35:22.110
It's a big tree.

00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.950
And we're just like little
insects to that tree.

00:35:27.950 --> 00:35:31.630
And I asked the teenagers,
if General Sherman, who

00:35:31.630 --> 00:35:35.630
has lived for 2,000 years,
could give a message

00:35:35.630 --> 00:35:37.760
to humanity, what would he say?

00:35:40.890 --> 00:35:44.664
And some of the boys--
you know how boys are.

00:35:44.664 --> 00:35:48.990
[LAUGHTER] They were
saying all these kind

00:35:48.990 --> 00:35:52.210
of ridiculous, humorous things.

00:35:52.210 --> 00:35:53.950
But there was one girl.

00:35:53.950 --> 00:35:58.010
Her name was-- I think
Lakshmi, American girl.

00:36:01.070 --> 00:36:04.050
She started to speak.

00:36:04.050 --> 00:36:06.000
And with her first
words, she began to cry.

00:36:09.070 --> 00:36:11.500
And then she talked.

00:36:11.500 --> 00:36:15.790
The way she spoke-- you've
heard about this concept

00:36:15.790 --> 00:36:18.040
of channeling.

00:36:18.040 --> 00:36:21.390
Well, it seemed like
that tree was channeling

00:36:21.390 --> 00:36:24.330
through her [LAUGHTER]
because she was speaking

00:36:24.330 --> 00:36:28.840
with such conviction
and such depth.

00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:30.670
She was only about 15 years old.

00:36:35.180 --> 00:36:37.310
She had the voice of the tree.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:39.895
She said, why are you
humans so foolish?

00:36:44.840 --> 00:36:49.500
I've been here before any
of you white people ever

00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.320
came to this continent.

00:36:52.320 --> 00:36:57.571
I've been here at
the time of Jesus,

00:36:57.571 --> 00:37:01.080
at the time of the rise and
fall of the Roman Empire.

00:37:03.930 --> 00:37:07.370
I've been here through
the Renaissance,

00:37:07.370 --> 00:37:11.990
through World War I and
World War II, the Civil War,

00:37:11.990 --> 00:37:14.130
the Vietnam War, the Korean War.

00:37:17.170 --> 00:37:23.330
I've seen what you've done to
the skies, and to the oceans,

00:37:23.330 --> 00:37:26.210
and to the Earth.

00:37:26.210 --> 00:37:29.186
Why are you always fighting?

00:37:29.186 --> 00:37:31.700
Why are you always
exploiting nature?

00:37:31.700 --> 00:37:33.590
Why are you always
exploiting each other?

00:37:33.590 --> 00:37:36.490
Why so much greed?

00:37:36.490 --> 00:37:41.920
She said, don't you see, you're
only here for a couple years.

00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.250
Your life is so short.

00:37:44.250 --> 00:37:47.715
Why can't you learn to
cooperate on a higher principle?

00:37:54.330 --> 00:37:58.830
She was crying, thinking
of what the tree was

00:37:58.830 --> 00:38:00.115
seeing humanity doing.

00:38:03.530 --> 00:38:10.320
So when I was walking with
[HINDU] in the Muir Woods,

00:38:10.320 --> 00:38:13.570
I was reflecting on
all these things.

00:38:13.570 --> 00:38:17.715
And then we came across
a group of tourists,

00:38:17.715 --> 00:38:22.060
who were in a circle
around the park ranger.

00:38:22.060 --> 00:38:24.770
And as we were walking
by, the park ranger said,

00:38:24.770 --> 00:38:27.740
I am going to tell you
the underground secret

00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:29.555
of the redwood forest.

00:38:32.500 --> 00:38:37.400
Now having been a teenager
in the 1960s in America,

00:38:37.400 --> 00:38:42.350
I still have a
spontaneous attraction

00:38:42.350 --> 00:38:47.825
to underground things,
especially secrets.

00:38:50.390 --> 00:38:54.590
He said, now please listen
carefully because this is-- it

00:38:54.590 --> 00:39:00.120
changed my life in a special
way hearing this park ranger.

00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:02.710
Usually I expect
to change my life

00:39:02.710 --> 00:39:06.390
by listening to some
scholar of the Vedas,

00:39:06.390 --> 00:39:12.570
or some preacher of the
Bible, or some great yogi.

00:39:15.395 --> 00:39:20.830
But my life changed,
listening to a park ranger.

00:39:20.830 --> 00:39:27.532
He said that in the Muir
Woods, the soil is very loose.

00:39:27.532 --> 00:39:30.170
It doesn't have much stability.

00:39:30.170 --> 00:39:36.110
And it's hilly, which makes
the stability even less.

00:39:36.110 --> 00:39:42.810
For a tree to grow
high and survive,

00:39:42.810 --> 00:39:44.720
it requires deep roots.

00:39:49.110 --> 00:39:52.880
The redwoods-- the
roots do not grow deep.

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.880
They don't grow deep at all.

00:39:55.880 --> 00:40:06.090
So how are these trees
surviving 1,000, 2,000 years,

00:40:06.090 --> 00:40:09.260
through numerous
massive earthquakes

00:40:09.260 --> 00:40:17.920
here, through frigid blizzards
in the winter, though

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:19.853
incredible windstorms?

00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:27.590
And they just keep growing
higher, and higher, and higher,

00:40:27.590 --> 00:40:31.180
higher than any other living
being in the entire planet.

00:40:31.180 --> 00:40:32.025
How do they survive?

00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:40.800
Then he stopped speaking
and let us all to imagine.

00:40:45.390 --> 00:40:48.800
It seemed like such
a contradiction.

00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:53.780
Then he explained how the
roots of the redwood trees,

00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.160
they may not grow down deep.

00:40:56.160 --> 00:41:00.970
But underground,
they grow outward.

00:41:00.970 --> 00:41:05.910
And each root is searching for
the root of another redwood

00:41:05.910 --> 00:41:06.810
tree.

00:41:06.810 --> 00:41:11.190
And as soon as they come
together, they embrace.

00:41:11.190 --> 00:41:18.370
They entwine around each other
and form a permanent lock.

00:41:18.370 --> 00:41:21.800
All the roots of the trees
are looking for other trees

00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.850
to make that relationship with.

00:41:25.850 --> 00:41:36.680
And in this way, the little baby
trees that are so vulnerable--

00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:40.540
the big, giant, ancient
trees provide their roots

00:41:40.540 --> 00:41:44.140
for the baby trees to
wrap their roots around,

00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.555
to give them their full support.

00:41:49.470 --> 00:41:52.710
And even the giant
trees, they're

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:56.040
so vulnerable because
they're so high.

00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:58.160
But all the other
trees in the forest

00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:01.120
directly or indirectly
are interconnected.

00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.130
And they're all giving
support to each other.

00:42:10.300 --> 00:42:17.080
From a human perspective,
the roots of our existence

00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:23.550
is very much in our affection,
in our love, in our concern,

00:42:23.550 --> 00:42:26.690
in our care.

00:42:26.690 --> 00:42:30.100
And when we reach
out to actually see

00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:36.360
this larger picture, of how
it's not about I, me, or mine,

00:42:36.360 --> 00:42:37.370
it's about us.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:43.960
The "Bhagavad Gita" defines
wisdom-- [SANSKRIT].

00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.655
The true wisdom is to see every
living being with equal vision.

00:42:58.540 --> 00:43:02.850
Because beyond these three modes
of nature, the "Gita" explains,

00:43:02.850 --> 00:43:07.796
there is the divine
state of consciousness.

00:43:07.796 --> 00:43:12.320
Of understanding beyond
this ever-changing world

00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:15.460
and beyond this
ever-changing mind,

00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:20.500
there is the witness that is
within us, the true self, that

00:43:20.500 --> 00:43:23.940
in Sanskrit is called the Atma.

00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:27.140
So call it the
soul, or the spirit,

00:43:27.140 --> 00:43:30.120
or the living force, or the
source of consciousness.

00:43:33.170 --> 00:43:37.100
That conscious force is
seeing through our eyes,

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.740
and hearing through our
ears, and experiencing life

00:43:39.740 --> 00:43:42.467
through our brains,
and through our hearts,

00:43:42.467 --> 00:43:43.425
and through our bodies.

00:43:47.360 --> 00:43:53.010
When we're tiny, little babies,
we have certain desires.

00:43:53.010 --> 00:43:56.000
We have a certain
type of little body.

00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:00.700
And now, most of us have
very different bodies.

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:02.950
And our minds are
thinking very different.

00:44:02.950 --> 00:44:04.880
We're not thinking
about our mother's milk

00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:08.390
any more, like we used to.

00:44:08.390 --> 00:44:09.740
So everything's changing.

00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:13.700
But still we're the
same person who's

00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.700
witnessing life through
all these transformations.

00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.158
Who am I?

00:44:22.370 --> 00:44:25.270
A driver in a car takes
good care of the car,

00:44:25.270 --> 00:44:27.970
but understands that he
or she needs something

00:44:27.970 --> 00:44:31.900
more than gasoline for himself,
gives the gasoline to the car,

00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:34.220
but I need something else.

00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.935
What are the needs of
the soul, the true self?

00:44:40.830 --> 00:44:46.440
To love and to be loved, that's
the basic fundamental need

00:44:46.440 --> 00:44:49.090
for everyone.

00:44:49.090 --> 00:44:52.810
And love is beyond selfishness.

00:44:52.810 --> 00:44:55.910
To love is to care.

00:44:55.910 --> 00:44:59.310
To feel love is
to feel cared for.

00:44:59.310 --> 00:45:02.390
And the origin of that love
according to the "Gita"

00:45:02.390 --> 00:45:07.890
is the soul's relationship
with the Supreme Soul, who

00:45:07.890 --> 00:45:09.910
is called by many
names, sometimes

00:45:09.910 --> 00:45:15.000
God-- in our tradition,
Krishna or Rama.

00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:22.490
When we tap into that inner
truth of who we really

00:45:22.490 --> 00:45:29.610
are and we experience that
love, that compassion,

00:45:29.610 --> 00:45:32.810
then whatever we
may do in our life

00:45:32.810 --> 00:45:36.410
is an expression of that
love and our compassion.

00:45:36.410 --> 00:45:38.450
And when we understand
who we really are,

00:45:38.450 --> 00:45:41.580
we can actually understand
the equality of all beings

00:45:41.580 --> 00:45:44.835
because we see that spiritual
essence wherever there's life.

00:45:48.510 --> 00:45:51.480
Whether a person is black,
or white, or red, or yellow,

00:45:51.480 --> 00:45:54.850
or brown; or male or
female; or whether one is

00:45:54.850 --> 00:45:57.800
from the East or the
West; whether one

00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:00.150
is a Hindu, or a Muslim,
or a Jew, or a Jain,

00:46:00.150 --> 00:46:03.960
or a Christian, or a Sikh, or
a Zoroastrian, or an agnostic,

00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:07.610
or an atheist; whether one
is a human, or an elephant,

00:46:07.610 --> 00:46:13.120
or a cow, or a dog, or a cat,
or a redwood tree, [LAUGHTER]

00:46:13.120 --> 00:46:16.340
we see that life is sacred.

00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:19.510
And when we start that life
force within ourselves,

00:46:19.510 --> 00:46:22.430
we naturally will
respect that life force

00:46:22.430 --> 00:46:23.620
wherever it is being seen.

00:46:27.150 --> 00:46:29.700
And then there is this
higher fulfillment.

00:46:29.700 --> 00:46:31.730
There is this higher purpose.

00:46:31.730 --> 00:46:33.716
Which creates an
integrity that none

00:46:33.716 --> 00:46:37.200
of the storms of this world
or the inevitable changes

00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:46.910
can shake us, the integrity of
compassion, based on wisdom,

00:46:46.910 --> 00:46:49.210
based on love.

00:46:49.210 --> 00:46:51.880
That is within us.

00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:53.920
And all the great
spiritual paths

00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:58.120
are ultimately meant
to reconnect us

00:46:58.120 --> 00:47:02.850
to that inner essence,
wherein we can really

00:47:02.850 --> 00:47:09.270
find a foundation, where
we could find those roots.

00:47:09.270 --> 00:47:17.170
And we could learn to reach
out together, to respect

00:47:17.170 --> 00:47:20.120
each other, to honor each
other, to love each other.

00:47:23.930 --> 00:47:27.270
And to reach out toward
all living beings

00:47:27.270 --> 00:47:33.326
and to Mother Nature herself
in that spirit of compassion.

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:45.610
Google, perhaps more than any
other company in the world,

00:47:45.610 --> 00:47:52.500
has mastered and perfected
the science of networking--

00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:59.180
and if here we could
find that inner essence.

00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:06.990
And I have heard there are many
projects that really are being

00:48:06.990 --> 00:48:12.400
designed here at Google on
the foundation of these higher

00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.410
principles.

00:48:14.410 --> 00:48:16.360
And I thank you for that.

00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:20.290
And I'm so grateful that you
have given me this chance

00:48:20.290 --> 00:48:22.213
to speak these words today.

00:48:22.213 --> 00:48:24.578
Thank you.

00:48:24.578 --> 00:48:25.997
[APPLAUSE]

00:48:37.042 --> 00:48:39.000
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you
so much Radhanath Swami

00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.640
for such a wonderful talk.

00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:42.910
We'll have a book signing now.

00:48:42.910 --> 00:48:46.550
And also before that, we'll
have a nine-minute Q&amp;A

00:48:46.550 --> 00:48:48.790
because the room
is booked at 2:00.

00:48:48.790 --> 00:48:50.650
So if you want to
continue to hang around,

00:48:50.650 --> 00:48:52.560
there is a micro-kitchen here.

00:48:52.560 --> 00:48:55.210
So we'll have Radhanath
Swami go there.

00:48:55.210 --> 00:48:57.560
And you can get signatures
of the books, "Journey Home."

00:48:57.560 --> 00:49:00.820
They're available for a
subsidized price of like $10.

00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:04.240
And you can also have
any personal questions

00:49:04.240 --> 00:49:05.390
answered there.

00:49:05.390 --> 00:49:08.446
So for next nine minutes,
we'll have Q&amp;A here.

00:49:08.446 --> 00:49:09.570
We'll pass around the mics.

00:49:09.570 --> 00:49:10.778
You can just raise your hand.

00:49:29.502 --> 00:49:30.960
AUDIENCE: In your
lecture, you said

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:34.880
that we can temper our
passion with goodness, rather

00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:39.400
than sliding down
to moral ignorance.

00:49:39.400 --> 00:49:43.960
So [INAUDIBLE], can you
elaborate more on how can

00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:46.535
we practically do that
in our daily lives?

00:49:54.262 --> 00:49:55.720
RADHANATH SWAMI:
The association we

00:49:55.720 --> 00:50:01.410
choose to connect with when
we associate with people who

00:50:01.410 --> 00:50:06.640
enlighten us, when we associate
with activities that enlighten

00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:11.350
us, the books we read,
the entertainment we find,

00:50:11.350 --> 00:50:16.690
the people we keep company
with, it very much affects

00:50:16.690 --> 00:50:19.490
our values and our choices.

00:50:19.490 --> 00:50:22.310
And that association
is very important.

00:50:22.310 --> 00:50:29.090
And that's also why a regular
spiritual practice keeps

00:50:29.090 --> 00:50:33.510
us very strongly connected
to these higher principles--

00:50:33.510 --> 00:50:36.030
ultimately, the
principle of God's grace.

00:50:41.130 --> 00:50:42.490
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:50:42.490 --> 00:50:43.823
RADHANATH SWAMI: You're welcome.

00:50:46.270 --> 00:50:49.895
In our tradition, we chant God's
names to keep that connection.

00:50:54.584 --> 00:50:56.000
MALE SPEAKER: Any
other questions?

00:51:02.144 --> 00:51:03.310
AUDIENCE: Thank you so much.

00:51:03.310 --> 00:51:05.660
I thought your
talk was beautiful.

00:51:05.660 --> 00:51:09.520
I so resonate with it all,
especially with nature

00:51:09.520 --> 00:51:11.490
and respecting all life.

00:51:14.330 --> 00:51:21.369
What does a typical day look
like for you, your schedule?

00:51:21.369 --> 00:51:22.410
RADHANATH SWAMI: Typical?

00:51:26.470 --> 00:51:30.280
I have to search my
memories for a typical day.

00:51:30.280 --> 00:51:34.120
[LAUGHTER]

00:51:34.120 --> 00:51:36.514
Well, I'm not here
in the Bay Area,

00:51:36.514 --> 00:51:43.400
[LAUGHTER] I usually arise
around 4:00 in the morning.

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:47.740
Because it's really a
precious time of the day.

00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:49.791
In so many
traditions, especially

00:51:49.791 --> 00:51:51.790
in our own traditions,
it's call Brahma-muhurta.

00:51:59.610 --> 00:52:01.530
It's a very powerful
time of the day

00:52:01.530 --> 00:52:03.980
to make spiritual connections.

00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:07.580
And for focus and concentration
because kind of everybody

00:52:07.580 --> 00:52:08.890
is sleeping.

00:52:08.890 --> 00:52:12.340
And the passions of
the world around us

00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:16.840
haven't really started
filling the environment.

00:52:16.840 --> 00:52:21.920
And because we're just woken up,
our mind and our consciousness

00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:24.620
is kind of like a blank slate.

00:52:24.620 --> 00:52:29.600
And if we fill it with something
wonderful, with divine grace,

00:52:29.600 --> 00:52:31.460
then throughout the
day we can actually

00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:36.540
be energized, empowered,
to share that grace.

00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:41.240
So we begin, we chant
the names of God,

00:52:41.240 --> 00:52:46.350
usually for a couple
hours-- and prayer beads.

00:52:46.350 --> 00:52:49.090
It's a type of meditation.

00:52:49.090 --> 00:52:53.090
The mantra in my tradition
is Hare Krishna Hare Krishna

00:52:53.090 --> 00:52:58.100
Krishna Krishna Hare Hare
Hare Rama Hare Rama Rama Rama.

00:52:58.100 --> 00:53:00.790
We believe that all these
mantras or all these divine

00:53:00.790 --> 00:53:04.980
sounds from all these great
spiritual traditions connect us

00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.250
to that divine essence
and that grace within us.

00:53:10.920 --> 00:53:15.720
And when I'm near it,
an ashram, we usually

00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:18.925
have kirtan or
chanting together,

00:53:18.925 --> 00:53:21.050
where, like the
redwood roots, we're

00:53:21.050 --> 00:53:24.900
all united for one purpose,
to try to purify and cleanse

00:53:24.900 --> 00:53:28.790
the world through
Krishna, God's grace.

00:53:28.790 --> 00:53:30.425
And we study
scriptures together.

00:53:35.650 --> 00:53:37.090
Then we take sacred food.

00:53:37.090 --> 00:53:39.360
We're vegetarians.

00:53:39.360 --> 00:53:42.160
And then we go and do our seva.

00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:46.260
My seva is-- I live in
India actually, in Mumbai.

00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:49.140
And we have many projects.

00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:53.710
We have an ashram with
about 150 monks in it.

00:53:53.710 --> 00:53:55.150
And we have the temple.

00:53:55.150 --> 00:53:58.030
And many thousands of
people come every day.

00:53:58.030 --> 00:54:04.610
And we have a congregation
of over 10,000 people.

00:54:04.610 --> 00:54:07.110
And we have a 200-bed hospital.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:10.580
And we have an orphanage
and we have a hospice.

00:54:10.580 --> 00:54:13.420
And we have this one
project for feeding children

00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:16.410
in the ghetto schools
in the Bombay area.

00:54:16.410 --> 00:54:22.210
Because the number one reason
for illiteracy is hunger.

00:54:22.210 --> 00:54:25.675
And instead of children going
and working-- child labor

00:54:25.675 --> 00:54:30.600
or begging-- if they get
food, they'll stay in school.

00:54:30.600 --> 00:54:34.250
So we are feeding about
410,000 children a day

00:54:34.250 --> 00:54:37.120
now from our kitchens.

00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.390
And we have an
eco-village, where

00:54:39.390 --> 00:54:42.550
we have beautiful
cows and other animals

00:54:42.550 --> 00:54:44.830
that we protect
throughout their lives.

00:54:44.830 --> 00:54:48.220
And we build our buildings
out of the natural earth

00:54:48.220 --> 00:54:51.630
that's around us, in
eco-friendly ways.

00:54:51.630 --> 00:54:54.860
And we have natural
organic sewage refineries.

00:54:54.860 --> 00:54:59.120
So every time you
flush the toilet,

00:54:59.120 --> 00:55:03.840
you're actually investing
a wonderful contribution

00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.090
into the community.

00:55:09.970 --> 00:55:12.970
It takes longer than nine
minutes to talk about this.

00:55:12.970 --> 00:55:14.120
But it's quite incredible.

00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:16.960
By gravity and solar power,
you flush the toilet.

00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.910
And it goes into a place.

00:55:18.910 --> 00:55:22.210
And then it comes down
through these different herbs,

00:55:22.210 --> 00:55:26.905
and roots, and
stones to filter it.

00:55:26.905 --> 00:55:28.540
And it comes out
crystal-clear water.

00:55:31.666 --> 00:55:33.040
We have thousands
of fruit trees.

00:55:33.040 --> 00:55:35.550
And we grow our
own organic food.

00:55:35.550 --> 00:55:39.800
But interestingly, we had
a yoga group from New York

00:55:39.800 --> 00:55:40.940
just a couple months ago.

00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.330
I was there.

00:55:42.330 --> 00:55:44.410
And they looking at the papayas.

00:55:44.410 --> 00:55:46.576
They were about this big.

00:55:46.576 --> 00:55:48.730
And they were eating
the papayas every day.

00:55:48.730 --> 00:55:49.970
They really liked it.

00:55:49.970 --> 00:55:53.630
And then they came up to where
this sewage refinery was.

00:55:53.630 --> 00:55:56.082
And papayas were about this big.

00:55:56.082 --> 00:55:59.690
[LAUGHTER]

00:55:59.690 --> 00:56:08.900
So on one lady yogi, she gave
a new name to our papayas.

00:56:08.900 --> 00:56:16.890
She called them "poopayas."

00:56:16.890 --> 00:56:19.080
So I kind oversee
these projects.

00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:23.160
And I have a lot of meetings
and a lot of counseling.

00:56:23.160 --> 00:56:25.780
We have thousands and
thousands of married couples.

00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:28.120
And sometimes they
need counseling.

00:56:28.120 --> 00:56:34.930
[LAUGHTER]

00:56:34.930 --> 00:56:37.520
So that's the
typical day for me.

00:56:37.520 --> 00:56:40.150
And then I usually give
lectures in the evening,

00:56:40.150 --> 00:56:45.140
public lectures-- sometimes
in the morning too.

00:56:45.140 --> 00:56:48.320
And then I take rest.

00:56:48.320 --> 00:56:52.630
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:56:59.900 --> 00:57:06.180
RADHANATH SWAMI: In Mumbai,
most of the congregational

00:57:06.180 --> 00:57:09.640
and ashram and
temple activities are

00:57:09.640 --> 00:57:12.640
funded by the
congregation itself.

00:57:12.640 --> 00:57:14.300
Because within our
congregation, we

00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:19.790
have a lot of teachers,
industrialists,

00:57:19.790 --> 00:57:25.460
business people, a lot of
software engineers-- [LAUGHTER]

00:57:25.460 --> 00:57:26.519
AUDIENCE: Oh, I see.

00:57:26.519 --> 00:57:28.060
RADHANATH SWAMI:
--believe it or not.

00:57:32.060 --> 00:57:35.930
So everyone-- because
they're inspired,

00:57:35.930 --> 00:57:39.320
we don't actually have too
much fundraising in that sense.

00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:45.640
People just, out of
their own appreciation,

00:57:45.640 --> 00:57:49.430
they want to support and give
because they're inspired.

00:57:49.430 --> 00:57:52.690
And according to what
we get, we built.

00:57:52.690 --> 00:57:55.060
And as far as some of
the more public programs,

00:57:55.060 --> 00:57:58.280
like the feeding of the
children-- and the hospital

00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:02.350
does a lot of programs-- because
cataracts are the number one

00:58:02.350 --> 00:58:03.770
cause of blindness in India.

00:58:03.770 --> 00:58:07.080
So we do thousands and thousands
of free cataract surgeries

00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:10.680
in the villages, a lot of
education in the ghettos

00:58:10.680 --> 00:58:13.420
and village schools for health.

00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:17.670
So those things are
funded by just people

00:58:17.670 --> 00:58:20.490
from all over the world,
who appreciate the cause.

00:58:23.660 --> 00:58:28.290
And whatever we have, we
just do that much more.

00:58:28.290 --> 00:58:31.960
But it's based on a
spiritual principle

00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:34.570
that when we actually
come in contact

00:58:34.570 --> 00:58:38.750
with our eternal
souls-- and "Bhakti"

00:58:38.750 --> 00:58:45.380
means to awaken the dormant
love for God that's within us.

00:58:45.380 --> 00:58:47.580
When you water the
root of the tree,

00:58:47.580 --> 00:58:51.970
the water naturally extends
to every part of the tree.

00:58:51.970 --> 00:58:53.870
So through our
spiritual practice

00:58:53.870 --> 00:58:56.400
and through our seva,
or our services,

00:58:56.400 --> 00:59:01.730
our aim is to actually
come in contact

00:59:01.730 --> 00:59:05.500
with the infinite beauty
and sweetness of God's love

00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:08.890
and be an instrument of
that love in whatever we do.

00:59:08.890 --> 00:59:16.030
And I personally have found
when we live by that principle,

00:59:16.030 --> 00:59:19.660
and reduce our ego and humble
ourself to that principle,

00:59:19.660 --> 00:59:24.015
then everything in life becomes
magical, even the challenges.

00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:40.577
And as the world moves, the
hands of time moves with it.

00:59:40.577 --> 00:59:45.530
[LAUGHTER] I am deeply
grateful to all of you,

00:59:45.530 --> 00:59:47.420
to spend this time with you.

00:59:47.420 --> 00:59:48.920
Thank you very much.

00:59:48.920 --> 00:59:51.670
[APPLAUSE]
