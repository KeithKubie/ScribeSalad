Speaker 1:          00:00          All right, let's do it. Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. This is more perfect mini series about the Supreme Court and um, today's story from a reporter. Shawn always eff up your last name. Can you just say it? Ramas from Ramez from, I always put the accent in the morning place. Anyhow, let me set the table for you. We live in a representative democracy. And what does that actually mean? Practically speaking? Like when do we come in contact with that democracy? Two places seems to me mainly one when we vote, right? Yeah. You're asking me? Yeah. I was deep in thought if you vote, if you vote. It's true. I know like college educated, super progressive human beings who are like, why would I ever vote? It doesn't mean anything. Exactly. Not to mention people who just don't even care about the world. Yeah. It sorta makes my point like voting is the first way. And for a lot of people it's entirely optional. The second way is not, you will be fine.

Speaker 2:          00:47          You don't do it. And I mean serving on a jury. This is where like we, the people decide who goes to jail, who gets free, who lives, who dies. This is where we actually do democracy today. Uh, we start with the story of a guy who supreme, who is Supreme Court famous, would you say? Yeah, he's in the books. He's like a chapter. Yeah. He's like one of the most important names you've never heard of because he's at the center of this ongoing battle about who gets to serve on juries and his name depending on who you are, either symbolizes the best parts of American democracy or the most cynical, should I say his name? Yeah, go for it. James Batson. James Kirkland.

Speaker 3:          01:29          That's, Hello James.

Speaker 4:          01:37          I went to his house in Northville. Tell me your full name and tell me where you're from and that James Batson, Louisville, Kentucky, James Batson, his name just kept coming up over and over again when I was looking through the history of jury selection in America. So I called him up and I was like, Hey, I'm this radio reporter in New York City and I'm really interested in your case because there's this other case before the court right now. Could I come talk to you? And he's, he was like, oh, yeah, sure. Okay, make sure my full name and shitty mentioned. Of course he's tall, he's built like a fridge. Um, he's a black man. Drove a truck, local and cross country far from being business 15 hours one way. Where was that? Florida as a kid. He was, he was an aid student. Graduated from her and technical high school, Hughes, uh, you know, like vocational school, specializing in electrical engineering, industrial electricity. He seemed pretty popular, perfect tennis water Sunday school when I was 18, but shortly after that it seemed like the bottom fell out.

Speaker 3:          02:38          [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          02:41          James Batson grew up in the West End of Louisville in the 1970s and the west end was super rough. People selling dope prostitution, uh, just everything had to do with past money at a young age. Fast money was like the American dream. I, it's pretty hard when a lot of people around you got nice things and they got them because they're doing something illegal and you keep coming up with rabid error to shaking your head like you know [inaudible] you pull both of your pockets out and ain't nothing to neither one of them. He said it all started when he was 10 he wanted a pair of shoes. He couldn't afford them. Chuck Tyler's, well, when I first came out, if you didn't have a pair of those, you get on what they call buddies loaded buddies, cheap tennis shoes. Him and his brother asked his mom for money and they, she gave them some money but not enough so to make up the difference.

Speaker 4:          03:36          They went out and they stole people's empty soda bottles and turn them in for like the deposits three sent our Nicola piece stole the pop bottles to get Chuck Tyler. There was my first experience with pure legal money stolen pop bottles, so everything else there. Fast forward a couple of years, James is more grown up. He start doing some petty crime in and he starts breaking into houses. They actually gave me a name, call me to pants pocket. Birdwell when the crime would happen, burglar would take only stuff competing in his pocket, like purses and jewelry. No merchandise. He didn't fit in his pocket. He wouldn't take it. And that was you. I'm not admitting that was me possible deniability because there is two murder names I'm asking you was a year. I take the fields. So James starts stealing bigger things and he starts getting arrested, starts going in and out of the courts and then one of those small in and out cases, it became, I think American legal history.

Speaker 4:          04:38          They got me out of a car, 1982 cops pull them over. You pull me out the car. They said you have the right to remain silent and anything and went through that little protocol, whatever they tell him some burglaries that happened in an area and it they said I did them. Well, you stealing stuff. Yeah. At the time I, I had been doing some burglaries or whatever, but anyway, but James said he didn't do this one and that they didn't have the proof. He was his driving around in his car and they picked him up. When they arrested me, I'm thinking they didn't really have a case against me. They didn't catch me breaking into a house. You got me out of the car in no fingerprints, no where he thinks he can win. I feel like I could beat case. So I'm like, I want a jury trial and I'm, the mere fact that you and I are talking about James Bateson's case 30 plus years later is amazing.

Speaker 5:          05:27          That's the prosecutor. My name is Joe Guttman. I'm from Louisville, Kentucky. Uh, grew up in Louisville, raised in Louisville wanting to be a lawyer since he was a kid. My parents went through a divorce when I was very young and I wanted to go to law school to help kids and divorces 1982 when Joe Guttman first gets the Batson case, he's 26 years old and had just become a lawyer. Uh, James's case was in the first six months that I was in the prosecutor's office. Pretty impressive. Uh, first year. Um, no,

Speaker 4:          05:56          starting out. I lost my first

Speaker 5:          05:58          eight trials. Really? Yeah. This is when it's our Bateson's case. You know, this low level burglary of breaking of a house in a purse being stolen. He was like, oh, maybe this'll be my, when the evidence appeared that he was guilty of the crime, James was accused and identified as the one who's having done it.

Speaker 6:          06:14          Two eye witnesses. They're saying James did it, but James is saying, no I didn't. You don't have any proof. He says the cops probably showed these witnesses photos of him before because that you need never seen them before in his life. So, so governments on the case, it goes to trial and he had a hung jury. They ended up being a hung jury. It means they couldn't come to a unanimous decision. So James gets off.

Speaker 5:          06:35          Why was it a hung jury? Well, in Kentucky you have to have a unanimous verdict. So the defense is looking for that one juror that keeps from convicting. There is apparently one juror who just didn't buy it, didn't buy the evidence and thought James was legit. It was a black woman. One black lady came to visit me after the jury was over. She said, I really, really don't think you're guilty. The rest of the jury was trying to make me say that she was guilty and I was saying not guilty. So ended up being a hung jury. That was disappointed at that point I was having second thoughts about um, you know, is this the right career for me?

Speaker 6:          07:10          So Joe Guttman, he says, I'm going to try this case one more time. It was pretty close to guilty. I had this one juror who hung it up. So let me do it one more time. And he does something this time a little differently just to set it up. As you know, when you get a jury summons, you go in, you're on a jury pool, and at the beginning of a trial all rise. Jurors please stand and raise your right hand. You have jury selection. Unh of you do solemnly swear or affirm that you will true answers tonight to such questions as may be asked you touching your call if the cat's with both sides, the prosecution, the defense, sometimes the judge, they get jurors into a room and they start asking lots of questions. Is there anyone here who's been the victim of a crime? Have you needed, you had family members that have been victims of crime. Okay. I saw a couple of hands. They start interviewing jurors. Do you have any opinions one way or the other about the criminal justice system in general to figure out which jurors do we want the [inaudible]? I do remember you're involved in any organizations. I'm the member of a church. Which jurors do we want to get rid of and that's the more important part of this process. Which jurors do we want to toss off this jury pool?

Speaker 6:          08:21          So what are the rules to get rid of jurors? There's two ways to get rid of jurors to get down to that group of 12 in this case. And the first way is called striking for cause the state would move to, excuse him for cause at this time striking for cause is like when they ask you can you be fair in this case if you say, you know, no I really can't. I have really strong feelings about the people or the subject matter. That's a strike for cause. Or it's like, hey that lady who's sitting in the chair, the defendant that's um, that's my cousin. We grew up together. No, like conflict of interest. Convolutions that's my boss. We'd go out every Saturday for brunch. Whatever it is. You're too close to this. You can't be fair. Got It. So that one's, cause that's pretty much common sense.

Speaker 6:          09:05          It makes sense to everyone. But the second way is the heart of this whole matter. This whole story. It's called a peremptory challenge. Preemptory or not? Peremptory peremptory that's a word. Depending on how you punch it into Google, it will be like, that's a type of a son. What does it mean? What does peremptory mean? Peremptory challenge means you get a certain number of strikes just to get rid of people you think might not be fair to you, but you can really use them anyway you want. And with these strikes, you don't have to give any reason. Wow. And how many of these do you get? So it varies from state to state. In some states it's 20 and other states, that's four in Kentucky then and now each side gets eight eight jurors that they just get to put the excellent and so you're not going to sit on this trial hook or crook and they don't have to explain themselves at all.

Speaker 6:          09:53          They don't have to explain anything. And this isn't just some weird legal rule we made up like 20 years ago. This is something that has been around. It's older than America. He goes back to England in the 11th 12th century. And before that some say it goes back to like one oh four BC Roman times. Really, really? And the idea is, I feel like the visualization is like a seesaw. Like okay, we need to get to this perfect group of 12 people. And you know there's going to be people who are biased either side. So each side gets to eliminate people. You get three, you get three, you get four, you get four and then we'll come to this balance in the jury of a group of people who are going to be fair. So if both sides are sort of trying to tilt it their way from either side, the thinking is it'll end up balanced.

Speaker 6:          10:36          Yeah. And also the thinking was that this would give both sides more faith in the process and at the same time protect both sides from like the tyranny of a trial judge who has too much power. Gotcha. Okay. And what happens in this case is the second trial begins. So take me into the moment of jury selection, which is I imagine early in, that's the first thing that happens. Set a scene. Well, the only people that were in the courtroom were some family members and Mr Bateson, his attorney, a detective and me and the jury. So the reason we're talking about this case and Joe Guttman and James Batson is because the next thing that happens is Joe Guttman gets up there, he scans the jury pool. And at this point he says there were 13 people left, four that were black, nine that were white. And he uses his peremptory challenges to strike off. One, two, three, four black jurors. They're all gone. Leaving an all white shirt. Do you remember striking four minority people off this jury? Uh, well, uh, I mean I did a, do I specifically remember the reason for each? Uh, no adult I asked Joe was the reason because they were in fact black. No, I can see that they were not stricken because of race.

Speaker 5:          11:55          And I remember specifically that one of the jurors lived in the neighborhood. He doesn't exactly remember what his reasons were for all four black jurors. But what's important for our story is to know that James Batson is sitting there in the room as all of this is happening.

Speaker 4:          12:10          And I'm like, ah, just completely struck out of blacks off the jury pool. It ain't right. And I told my lawyer, I said, you objected that they, you know, lawyer says, why would I object? James said, because it's not fair. He said, no, that's a longstanding rule. He's allowed to do that and you can strike what would be wrong. Was he loyal white or was he black? He was white. Judge white or black. He was white. And aside from those four people that had just been struck off the jury, everybody in the courtroom was white. So again, told my lawyer to object. And again, the lawyers says, he said, no, you, I've told you you can't object to this. So what do you mean you can't, you work for me. You do what? I say. You just object anyway. I don't care. This longstanding rule object, he did it all came behind that one. Objection. It's one tiny moment. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          13:03          What happened is after the jury was selected, Doug Dale, James, his attorney said, judge, how I want to make an objection. Uh, we went up to the bench. He said, your honor, you can see there's an all white jury. I would like for him to explain his strikes, but before I could get another word out of my mouth, Judge Ryan said, Mr Gutman does not have to explain his rights. It's not the law. Let's move on. Move on. So they moved on with an all white jury and I got found guilty.

Speaker 4:          13:40          They get 20 years. Hmm. For Burglary? Yes. So Batson goes to prison, Danville, Kentucky, and he says his first move when he got there or po immediately. And ultimately his appeal ends up in the hands of this guy, David Niehaus, Jefferson county public defender's office. And the house decides to do something ambitious. What we did is we call it and taking a tour of the jurisdictions, Washington Gallup barn in [inaudible]. It takes a legal road trip to me house and his team start looking at other states, looking at other regions to find out what this is a problem elsewhere. Is this just something limited to the south or is it something else? Do you mean like are people in other places doing what? Joe got mid dead and using peremptories to kick black people off a jury's [inaudible]. Right. And what he found is that this was happening. Sounds ideal and I need to check in Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio, pretty much everywhere. So they filed an appeal which worked its way up through the courts. And in December, 1985 thank you gentleman. Locations submitted hear arguments year in a battle against Kentucky. The case arrives at the Supreme Court of the United States.

Speaker 5:          15:00          I get a call one day from the Associated Press. That's Joe Guttman saying, how do you feel about the Supreme Court accepting the case of James Kirkland? Vanson and I was almost speechless. And where you sitting on the bench? Uh, I did, uh, go just to observe and learn

Speaker 4:          15:16          district main hundred sign thinking your proceeding whenever you're ready. Thank you your honor. Mr Chief Justice and may it please the court. So here's that ultimately went down,

Speaker 6:          15:27          that's inside me house. He argues that these strikes are being used to take black people off of juries. And this was happening everywhere. We were able to list some 25 jurisdictions and that the practice violated the 14th amendment, which was equal protection. And the sixth amendment, which was a right to a jury of your peers, a jury that is as representative of the community as possible. So if Louisville is like 17% black, the jury should probably be about 17% black and the prosecutors shouldn't just be allowed to skew that without having to give a reason. First of all, Kentucky's response to require an explanation of peremptory challenges would destroy, we believe the historical nature and function of the device itself until Kentucky saying, we shouldn't have to justify these strikes. The court has told us that again and again. It has always been unfettered and controlled by the court unexplained and this practice goes back centuries and yes, there may be some abuses, but this is a tool that lawyers need.

Speaker 4:          16:26          Thank you gentleman. The case is submitted four months later, the court delivers its verdict

Speaker 6:          16:33          and in a seven to two decision

Speaker 4:          16:37          that's and when the court found that the prosecutor's actions for sure violated the 14th amendment. They said racial discrimination of any kind in jury selection is not allowed. Q Dan Rather. The high court rule today is illegal totes illegal. Even on a peremptory challenge. It is illegal for a lawyer to reject the juror on the basis of rights. James Batson sentence was immediately vacated. How'd that feel? Okay, it's undescribable. If you were in prison and you know your sentence is being taken away, I mean that's great feeling. I'll still break every day. And in this conversation come up, y'all could just be hanging out playing chess. Oh, I got a law and the law books Batson rule.

Speaker 6:          17:21          And that was the biggest deal of all this. The headline there was this new rule and rule the bats and bets and match. And that's and rule named after him. So justice was put new limits on what is called preemptory challenge. The Batson rule. The Batson rule is an echo of what James did in court that day. When you see people, minorities getting booted off of a jury, you can say, your honor, I think that's a batching violation. That's in violation. And then the other side be it, the defense of the prosecution has to provide non-racial reasons for why they eliminated that juror. And for a lot of people, this was a breakthrough. This is like finally we figured out how to do this right. There was a system in place to protect everyone. And that system was even extended to civil cases and eventually to women as well. Uh, it was a big deal when the case was decided. And the initial elation was quickly tempered with a strong dose of reality.

Speaker 6:          18:18          This is Jeff Robinson. He's the director of the APLU Center for justice because what bats and prevents is deliberate racial discrimination. And, uh, almost immediately all over the country, prosecutors started training each other, teaching each other on how to get around Bateson. That's Bryan Stevenson, he's the director of the equal justice initiative in Montgomery, Alabama. I there at trainings all across the country. And some of these are on video data and I found fun. I mean, it's on Youtube when you're picking a jewelry and you gotta stay to these basic rules. This is one of those videos. This one, it's a Philadelphia prosecutor named Jack McMahon lecturing to a room full of young prosecutors on how to pick a jury,

Speaker 7:          19:01          you know, and in, in selecting blacks, you don't want the real educated ones. And my experience, black women, young black women are very bad. Uh, there's an antagonism, I guess maybe cause they're downtrodden on two respects. There they've got two minorities or women and their blacks. And so there are downtrod on two areas and they somehow, uh, want to take it out on somebody and you don't want it to be you. And so

Speaker 6:          19:24          the craziest thing about this video is that it was filmed just a few months after the Batson decision.

Speaker 7:          19:29          Batson versus Kentucky. I'm sure you've all become aware of that case. Yeah.

Speaker 6:          19:33          Jack Man basically tells these prosecutors, look, we've got this new rule. Here's how you break it. You strike the black person off the jury. But just say it's for another reason because that's what Batson requires is a racially neutral.

Speaker 7:          19:46          My advice would be in that situation is when you do have a black jury, are you questioning them at length and honest little sheet that you have marked something down that you can articulate later time if something happens. So let's say you strike three blacks to start with first three people write it down right then and there. I'd write it right in my little box there. You know, the woman had a kid about the same age as the defendant and I thought she'd be sympathetic to a more, she's unemployed and I just don't like unemployed people because I find they're not too stable. Quizzes

Speaker 6:          20:14          almost this training to create a catalog of reasons that on the face where race neutral, just say you're excluding them because they're too tall or they're too old. Oh, that person was wearing a black sweater. Things like, well, he lives in a bad neighborhood. Person would maintain eye contact, their body language, where they belong to a church, tattoos where they're a nurse. Any of those reasons have them marked down. As long as a prosecutor doesn't say, I excused that person because they're black bats and says it's completely okay.

Speaker 4:          20:48          I was actually working on a case. Uh, this is lawyer Bryan Stevenson again, my office, the at the time was called the southern prisoners defense committee. This was, and I was in Atlanta, Georgia before I moved to Alabama. And when was this? This was 1986 and we were defending someone down in Swainsboro, Georgia, a guy by the name of gamble. Uh, and, uh, the Batson decision came down, uh, and objections were made when the prosecutor used his peremptory strikes to exclude all of the African Americans. And we said, wait a minute, your honor, there's a new decision Batson versus Kentucky, which means that the prosecutor can't do this. And the court said, well, I've read Bateson. What this means is that the prosecutor has to give a race neutral reasons. And so the prosecutor, I've got my race neutral reasons is, well, I struck this woman because she looks just like the defendant.

Speaker 4:          21:35          That tendon was an African American man. They said, wait a minute, what does that she does? And the judge said, oh, I see that. He said, I struck judge that I see no, as he did what the prosecutor said, I struck this man because he lives in south Swainsboro and that's where the defendant lives. And we were, of course, we say, look, all the black people live in south Waynesboro, all the white people, that's not a race neutral reason. The judge had no, that is a race neutral reason. He said, I struck one person, uh, because this man was in the military and he was discharged after five years in the military. And in my experience, your honor, you only get discharged honorably after an even number of years or the jury was put back on the stand. We said, well, were you discharged from the military honorably?

Speaker 4:          22:14          Yes, I was. I was actually decorated. I got this metal, I got this award. I've got these things. Well, I still accept the prosecutors reading for excluding that person. No. My favorite was the prosecutors. Some of those for your phone? No, it gets better. It gets better. Roscoe said, I struck this man because he testified that he was a mason and he said, your honor, I just don't want anybody who's a member of a masonic lodge. All my jury, they have their own codes, their own rituals, they're all in culture. I don't want that. And the jury was put back on this day and we asked the juror, are you a member of a Masonic Lodge? And the jury said, no, I'm not. He said, I'm a brick mason. And the judge says, I still know what you mean, I'll let you exclude that person. Right. And so almost from the very beginning there was this cynicism is game playing. I used to tell people Bateson's not going to eliminate racial bias and jury selection, but it will make the jury selection process a lot more entertaining. You all should come to court and just watch the show. [inaudible]

Speaker 8:          23:16          that's why. So you could argue that not only did Batson not change anything, but that's in made things worse. Um, as one lawyer, Steven Bright, put it to me. I think what Batson is really is basically a set of procedures to sort of legitimize and cover up the race discrimination that's going on.

Speaker 4:          23:35          You had this smelly, putrid problem of racial discrimination in jury selection and instead of tossing it out, we just prayed for breeze all over. He just

Speaker 6:          23:46          kind of perfumed it vaguely sheep Cologne. It's still there. It just vaguely hidden. And now with the Batson rule, if you think the prosecution or the defense is striking people off because of race, you have to call them out and then you have to somehow try and prove that the reason they're providing is a lie. And that's really, really difficult to do.

Speaker 9:          24:10          Since 1986 for example, in the state of Washington, there have been probably 47 48 challenges on Batson issues where people have been convicted and they've said, wait a minute. The prosecutors were excusing people of color from the jury because they were people of color. Out of those 46 to 50 challenges, there's been one reversal.

Speaker 6:          24:32          The state of Tennessee has not reversed a single case under Bateson in the 30 years for it. It said, said the Batson decision came down as a result. He says there's still many counties in America where the diversity of the jury has not increased very much at all. So for example, in one Louisiana Parish, they looked at felony cases over an eight year period and found that nearly half the black jurors were struck in Houston county, Alabama over a five year period. The data establish that 80% of the African Americans qualify for jury service. We were struck 80% 80% and that's in death penalty cases, so wow. I mean if you think about that like a big percentage of the time, these are lawyers who are going around the bats and rule going around the law going around the constitution to get these all white juries who are then oftentimes pudding

Speaker 10:         25:25          black men to death and that reminds me of some pretty dark history. Yeah. Wow. Super basic question. Yeah. I mean

Speaker 6:          25:38          that video training video, the assumption in that video is it having black people on the jury would hurt? That guy would hurt the prosecutor. Yeah. Is that, should we just assume that or I mean is there anything, any data that would say that's even remotely true? The hardest thing about looking at this stuff analytically is that juries are like a black box. They don't let journalists and academics in often to study what's going on. The jury is kind of sacred that way. Yeah. But the few times we've gotten data, like there's this group called the Capitol Jury Project that looks at data specifically in capital cases because that's where this stuff ends up being life or death. So they looked at data in like 350 cases in 14 states over a number of years and they found that white men are more likely to go for the death penalty than black men.

Speaker 6:          26:29          When you get to sentencing that number that the difference between white and black, it's really exaggerated. Like white men are seven times more likely to want the death penalty than a black person. There. Another study that was done in Florida and this one looked at felony cases over like 10 years and they found that all white jury pools in Florida can be do black defendants 16% more often than white defendants. Okay. But what was really interesting is like that that gap was practically eliminated when at least one member of the jury pool was black. Interesting. You put one black person in the jury pool and that difference is annihilated. Yeah. And you can test the obvious question why? I mean, obviously criminal cases usually involve cops and the reason that's often cited is that you know, black jurors are less likely to believe cops. Lecturers are more likely to insert some sense of suspicion into the s the states or the Commonwealth or whatever his testimony. Yeah, and almost everyone I talked to gave me a version of this that that you know, when you have black people on a jury, they deliberate more and that black people are less likely to trust law enforcement, especially Jack McMahon who was the guy we heard from in that video.

Speaker 7:          27:38          Well listen, anybody that knows me knows I am about as the anti racist person that you could ever imagine. I might stone cold liberal to the nth degree, but I was talking about practicalities of picking the jury back then and I still stand by that. I mean if you're a prosecutor, all right, let me ask you this question. And you're trying to drug case so to speak, and your and your defense and the defendant is going to claim that the cops are lying. Okay. And you're the prosecutor. Now, what demographic group has had more exposure to police line than minority communities? They have seen a police lie and will believe police lie more than some white guy lives in a rich area. I believe that police officer, every time, everything he says, and so as a prosecutor you're trying to win the case and that person is not going to be a person who's going to be more questioning of your witnesses and you're given the opportunity through peremptory challenges to strike them. Why wouldn't you? You'd be a fool not to.

Speaker 6:          28:44          Well, I guess, uh, I s I see the argument that, you know, use your peremptory challenges to get the best jury you can to win. Right, but doesn't eliminating a black juror because you believe they might have certain biases against a police officer versus a white teacher in some way violate the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment? No,

Speaker 7:          29:06          I don't think so. Not at all. Because it's not because of the color of their skin. It's because of their demographics and where the, who they've dealt with. It's a societal demographic concept. It's just, it's just the fact of life. It's just like,

Speaker 6:          29:22          but I think those facts of life and those societal demographic [inaudible] concepts all stem from the color of their skin.

Speaker 7:          29:30          Oh Wow. That's it. That's it. That, that maybe a deeper issue that we can't deal with in jury selection. Uh, you're right. But the reality is the reality is that, that, that that's what the situation, so, so you're saying that if you're the prosecutor, you should say, oh, well this guy will probably be worse. Uh, for me, he probably believed those cops are lying, but I'm going to take them because I want to uphold the, you know, come on. I mean, that's just not realistic. That's just, there isn't a prosecutor in a country that would do that. Say, well, I want to, I want to show my altruism and I'm gonna keep this guy on my jury who may disbelieve my essential witnesses because I want to be out. You're Wistia. I mean, come on. That's just not the way life is.

Speaker 3:          30:16          [inaudible]

Speaker 11:         30:19          can we go, how to solve a problem like Bateson? Perfect. We'll continue in a moment.

Speaker 6:          31:29          This is more perfect mini series about the supreme court. I'm Jad Abumrad. I'm Sean Ramas from let's just for a second, explain how we got into this whole morass about racial bias in jury selection. I think we should, it's because of a case. It was in front of the Supreme Court. Uh, this term. Yup. Will hear argument first this morning in case 14, 83 49 foster versus Chapman. So basic facts. This is a murder case in Georgia. A younger black man kills an elderly white woman. The prosecutors dismiss a bunch of black jurors and the defense having this new bets and rules says hold up, can't do that. And the prosecutors give these race neutral reasons and the judge says, that looks good to me. And then years later something sort of incredible happens through like one of those freedom of information act type things. The defense actually gets to see the notes the prosecution had during the trial.

Speaker 6:          32:24          The notes they kept during jury selection. This is one of those rare times when we pull back the curtain and we find out what the prosecutors were doing. This is lawyer Steven Bright. He actually argued the foster case in front of the Supreme Court late last year and he says what you saw in these notes was that the prosecution, they literally wrote a little B next to the name of each and every black juror B one B two B three, uh, highlighting all the blacks and, and, and green on the, on the list of all the people summoned for jury duty. It's like race, racial discrimination is really hard to prove. This is actual physical proof in a file in the state. Like this is the smoking gun we've been waiting for. So what did the PR, what did the prosecutor, how did the prosecution argued this in front of a Supreme Court? Prosecution was like, you know what? Actually once the notes were found, they said foster is, we were just writing those bs because we wanted to make sure we noticed the black jurors. We wanted to keep track of them.

Speaker 12:         33:19          The reasonable explanation in this case is four months prior to trial, defense counsel files a motion and says the strike of any black juror, we're filing a Batson challenge.

Speaker 6:          33:28          That's the lawyer representing Georgia Beth Burton, and she's saying, of course we're going to notice race. This is the post Bateson world and we're going to note race and we're going to write it down.

Speaker 12:         33:37          I would be more surprised, quite frankly, if there wasn't some sort of highlighting.

Speaker 13:         33:42          In other words, the argument you're making here is that is that the reason he highlighted all the black jurors in green, he being the original prosecutor, uh, and a said a block but about the black jurors and did all these different things was because he was preparing a defense in case of a Batson challenge. Correct.

Speaker 6:          34:01          That's just as prior asking, well, why didn't you make that argument like when the case was actually happening years and years ago

Speaker 13:         34:09          and it was several years. Yes. So if that had been his real reason, why isn't it a little surprising that he never thought of it or didn't tell anybody until you raised this argument in your main brief

Speaker 12:         34:22          and, and I would, I would say that's on state habeas counsel. Hmm.

Speaker 6:          34:28          Uh, so the good news is that in a seven to one decision, the Supreme Court agreed that this prosecutor's reasons were utterly ridiculous. Well, it isn't. This is a, I'm just going to ask you, isn't this as clear about in violation as accord is ever going to see that Justice Kagan? I don't think it is. The bad news is that this case was in front of the Supreme Court at all. It had to get appealed up to the highest court in the land before someone said, Oh yeah, that's [inaudible] the Batson violation. That's how hard it is. Yeah. And the Supreme Court though, it made a forceful decision. Seven out of eight, they didn't make a new rule. They said, this isn't how it works. They didn't try offer up a Batson 2.0 or they didn't double down or throw it out or do some new rule. No, they said this is really wrong, but they didn't go as far to say, well clearly this doesn't work. So we still got Bateson. Yeah, still got Bateson. So, okay, if we want to diverse juries and we know that Bateson doesn't really work, what do we do? So I asked everyone I talked to that question and got a lot of different answers, but this was the obvious one. And Nancy, Nancy Margaret, who's a professor of law, IIT, Chicago, Kent College of Law starts us off. What I'd like the court to do is eliminate peremptory challenges. It's a no brainer again, that Steven Bright, he's a lawyer. We have to,

Speaker 7:          35:55          I mean it's like, it's like the Supreme Court gives you these rules of peremptory challenges to strike people and then says, well, wait a minute, don't just strike people. You know, we're gonna look into all the ways that you strike the people. Well then don't give them at all then for crying out loud. It's real simple.

Speaker 6:          36:09          Even Jack McMahon, the guy from that training video, he was open to it. We've had 30 years of experiment with Bateson and it's not working. We now have to go the route that Justice Marshall suggested back in [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          36:24          Batson. This court has never stated, not do not speak for the constitution. The rule in the Batson decision, you've got Thurgood Marshall, like the most important attorney in the civil rights movement turned the first Black Supreme Court justice. He in the same paragraph called the Batson decision, historic and then said, this isn't going to work. This decision isn't going to do anything. He was basically a fortune teller. He said both those things in the same breath, in one paragraph, he started out going, this decision today, historic by the end of the paragraph, you're never going to fix this until you get rid of peremptory challenges. [inaudible] 9% to both say, just do away with peremptory strikes. Look dead. Fall into constitution. If both sides are challenges, if code says do not [inaudible], no, sorry, will not violate the constitution. He said, as long as you have peremptory challenges, you will have discrimination. But what surprised me most in reporting this story is that, like I talked [inaudible] talk to

Speaker 6:          37:26          people on the left side of the criminal justice system on the right side of the criminal justice system, ACLU types, law professors, academics, conservative prosecutors, all of these people, when you say, guys, we've got to get rid of peremptory challenges, right? Almost every single one will say, no, no, no. It's kind of cool. That's a crucially important tool. We made them. It is crucially important. You know, it's an easy solution. Just get rid of peremptories. No, hell no. That's Ellie ms style or legal editor, law professor, Son Wolfe from Santa Clara University and lawyer David Niehaus again. And here's one of the arguments I heard. If you take these things away, all the decisions about striking jurors would be made by the judge on the question of whether the juror could be fair and impartial. And for that to work you have to have a fair judge and there are an awful lot of judges who aren't fair. Here's another argument I heard from Jeffrey Robinson from the ACLU and this is based on my experience of 34 years in the criminal justice system. Jeff Robinson says, if you can find some way to take race out of the equation, peremptories are super useful and he told me about this one case, very high profile case in the

Speaker 9:          38:36          state of Washington. This case was incredibly complicated and also potentially involved a coerced confession by some undercover cops and there's a police officer on the jury panel. He says, I can be fair. I know the police officers that investigated this case. I've worked with them before. I think they're really good people, but don't worry, I can be fair. Everything about his background was saying, I do not want this man to serve on this jury, but he was saying, I can be fair. I could not exclude him on a challenge for cause [inaudible] because he said he could be fair. The fact that he's a police officer doesn't mean he can't be fair but is insane. I know some of these people involved in this case enough to get him, uh, dismissed for cause it's enough to get more questioning. But how well do you know I'm not very well. So you're saying in that case, if you said, okay judge, I'd like to dismiss juror 17 for car cause the judge would say there's not a record per cause. I don't think any judge in this country would dismiss that juror for cause. Wow. And so a peremptory challenge is important. So I've watched more jury selection videos on youtube than any person ever should. And

Speaker 6:          39:51          it's this amazing thing where you see these people, they're not necessarily used to being in a courtroom. They're certainly not used to being grilled in public. 500 people in suits. They get up there to the jury panel and they get asked these questions. Does everyone agree that bias doesn't have any place in the trial? Over and over again? Can you be ferrying impartial? Yes sir. You're like a blank slate and you just got to listen to the evidence. Can you do all that? Yes, I can. Okay. Nobody Says No. Everyone feels like yes, I can be fair. And you know, this is the time to tell us. That's why we're asking you this. I'm thinking I could, okay, I can be totally unbiased and I think some of them believe that they can actually do this for nearly impossible task and others they know they can't, but they might say yes anyway.

Speaker 7:          40:36          Anyone who tries the case believe me knows that bias. Jurors comment, they don't reveal things, they lie about things. There's people that when you're questioning, I'm in a jury that you know they're lying to you. They're either trying to get on the jury or trying to get off the jury bias. People are being allowed to serve. So any tool that can help reduce the number of bias jurors on jurors is essential to justice.

Speaker 9:          40:59          So yeah, if you've got a really crappy outlook on jurors and humans, then maybe you need more peremptory challenges. But the way Jeffrey Robinson put it to me was that if you're using peremptory challenges the right way, it forces you to be like equal opportunity, suspicious, suspicious of everyone. And that's the only way to be fair. My parents were both active in the civil rights movement in Memphis, Tennessee as active as two people. You could ever want to meet both black. I would never let my mother sit on a criminal defense jury because my mother's view about black defendants was you're the reason I have to lock the door in my neighborhood. You're the reason that I get disrespected when I go out into the community and I'm going to take it out on you. My father's position would be, I wouldn't believe a police officer if he told me it was raining and the water was coming down on my head. And so what this is about is actually putting into effect what the rules say. Talk to jurors and find out what they think.

Speaker 6:          42:03          But what about Thurgood Marshall's idea that you know, if you have peremptory challenges, if you give people a way to discriminate, they will discriminate.

Speaker 9:          42:12          Well, I was born in 1956 and so in 1954 Thurgood Marshall argued Brown versus the board of Education, which had a significant impact on my life. Thurgood Marshall was someone that I have respected and someone I have admired virtually my entire life. But I can't agree with him that I want all peremptory challenges eliminated. And why do you think Thurgood Marshall Justice Marshall when straight to no perimeter? I think Justice Marshall concluded that he did not have faith in America to be able to make these kinds of decisions. And I understand why he concluded that. And you do you have that faith? I still do. And how long that will last? I don't know. Hmm. But I still do right now.

Speaker 14:         43:08          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          43:11          Robinson says that to give up on these peremptories is like giving up on who we might be one day because of who we are right now.

Speaker 9:          43:21          That's conceding that we are so divided by race that we will never be able to try and fix it. And I'm not prepared to concede that

Speaker 14:         43:35          [inaudible]

Speaker 6:          43:35          okay. One last thing for my trip.

Speaker 5:          43:37          De Louisville told Joe, Hey, what's up James? All right. Close by something that blew me away. I'm Joe Guttman. I'm a teacher at central high school, also an attorney at law, James Batson, truck grabber and construction worker. Amongst other things. I probably should add that I'm the former prosecutor of Mr Bateson's cases.

Speaker 6:          44:01          Joe Guttman and James Batson. Those two people whose conflict in a courtroom back in 1983 gave us the Batson rule. They are now in 2016.

Speaker 5:          44:12          Hmm. Friends. I've I've to him about him. Yes, dude.

Speaker 6:          44:17          Yep. We're friends. All right, let's do it. Yup. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad this is more perfect miniseries about the supreme court and, um, today's story from a reporter. Shawn, I always f up your last name. Can you just say it? Ramez from Ramas firm, I always put the accent, the wrong place. Anyhow,

Speaker 1:          44:32          let me set the table for you. We live in a representative democracy. And what does that actually mean? Practically speaking? Like when do we come in contact with that? Democracy to places seems to me mainly one when we vote, right? Yeah. You asking me? Yeah, I was deep in thought, if you vote, if you vote. It's true. I know like college educated, super progressive human beings who are like, why would I ever vote? It doesn't mean anything. Exactly. Not to mention people who just don't even care about the world. Yeah. It sort of makes my point like voting is the first way and for a lot of people it's entirely optional. The second right

Speaker 2:          45:03          away is not, you will be fine if you don't do it. And I mean serving on a jury, this is where like we, the people decide who goes to jail, who gets free, who lives, who dies. This is where we actually do democracy today. Uh, we start with the story of a guy who supreme, who is Supreme Court famous, would you say? Yeah. He's in the books. He's like a chapter. Yeah. He's like one of the most important names you've never heard of because he's at the center of this ongoing battle about who gets to serve on juries and his name. Depending on who you are, either symbolizes the best parts of American democracy or the most cynical, should I say his name? Yeah, go for it. James Batson. James Kirkland.

Speaker 3:          45:47          That's, Hello James Shot.

Speaker 4:          45:55          I went to his house and Norville tell me your full name and tell me where you're from and that James Batson, Louisville, Kentucky, James Batson, his name just kept coming up over and over again when I was looking through the history of jury selection in America. So I called him up and I was like, Hey, I'm this radio reporter in New York City and I'm really interested in your case because there's this other case before the court right now. Could I come talk to you? And he's, he was like, Oh yeah, sure. Okay, make sure my full name and shitty mentioned. Of course he's tall. He's built like a fridge. Um, he's a black man. Drove truck, local and cross country far for business, 15 hours one way. Where does that Florida as a kid, he was, he was an aide student. Graduated from her and technical high school. Hughes, uh, you know, like a vocational school specializing in electrical engineering, industrial electricity. He seemed pretty popular. [inaudible] perfect tennis water Sunday school when I was 18, but shortly after that it seemed like the bottom fell out.

Speaker 4:          46:59          James Batson grew up in the West End of Louisville in the 1970s and the west end was super rough with people selling dope prostitution. Uh, everything had to do with fast money at a young age. Fast money was like, oh, the American dream. I mean it's pretty hard when a lot of people round you got nice thing and they got them because they're doing something illegal and you keep calling up rabid. Here you're shaking your head like, you know what, rabbit or [inaudible] you pull both of your pockets and ain't nothing, didn't need them. One of them, he said it all started when he was 10. He wanted a pair of shoes. He couldn't afford them. Chuck Tyler's, well, when I first came out, if you didn't have a pair of those, you hit on what they call buddies, old buddies, cheap tennis shoes. Him and his brother asked his mom for the money and she gave them some money, but not enough, so to make up the difference. They went out and they stole people's empty soda bottles and turn them in for like the deposits [inaudible] Nicola piece stolen up pop bottles to get chuck Taylors. There was my first experience with.
