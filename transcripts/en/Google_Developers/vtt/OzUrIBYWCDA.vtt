00:00:09.037 --> 00:00:10.120
MALE SPEAKER: Hi everyone.

00:00:10.120 --> 00:00:12.190
I'm here with Francois again.

00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:13.290
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Hello.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:14.710
MALE SPEAKER: Hi.

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.040
We're here to talk
about something related

00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.230
to the previous talk we did
on channels, but different.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:23.540
What is the difference
between Google Chrome,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.690
the browser everybody
knows and uses, most of you

00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:29.846
probably use it, and Chromium?

00:00:29.846 --> 00:00:31.220
Chromium, I think
the first thing

00:00:31.220 --> 00:00:34.060
we should say about it is that
it's an open source project.

00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:36.275
That's really what
it's meant to be.

00:00:36.275 --> 00:00:37.275
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:00:37.275 --> 00:00:40.060
The open source
project Chromium is

00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.380
composed of three main things.

00:00:42.380 --> 00:00:46.710
First is the browser, like you
said, the Chromium browser.

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:50.430
Then you have the
rendering engine, Blink,

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:52.250
was a fork of WebKit.

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:56.890
And finally you get the
operating system, Chromium OS.

00:00:56.890 --> 00:00:59.890
MALE SPEAKER: So let's focus
on the browser side of things.

00:00:59.890 --> 00:01:02.780
So let's set aside
the rendering engine

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:04.620
and the OS side of things.

00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:08.810
So there's the Chromium browser,
and there's the Google Chrome

00:01:08.810 --> 00:01:10.840
product which is also a browser.

00:01:10.840 --> 00:01:13.170
Let's focus on the differences.

00:01:13.170 --> 00:01:15.070
The first one,
probably an obvious one

00:01:15.070 --> 00:01:19.680
to most people in terms of
difference, is the logo.

00:01:19.680 --> 00:01:20.680
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:21.930
MALE SPEAKER: Different logos.

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:22.970
Different colors.

00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:26.644
Googley colors for the Google
product, Google Chrome.

00:01:26.644 --> 00:01:28.810
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: We get
the blue one for Chromium,

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.610
and we get the yellow
one for Chrome Canary.

00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:34.600
MALE SPEAKER: So Canary,
I think it's worth

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.110
mentioning, but maybe not
at this point just yet.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:40.180
So first difference, logo.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.010
Number one.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:44.380
Number two, Chromium is
an open source project,

00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:48.000
so the source code is
open source, and yet

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.760
at the same time
the product that we

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.760
ship, which is Google
branded, Google Chrome,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:54.180
itself has a number
of pieces that

00:01:54.180 --> 00:01:56.930
are not open source, because
we've licensed technology.

00:01:56.930 --> 00:01:59.970
Another difference would be
that there is the bare bones

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.350
Chromium version,
and then there's

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:05.880
is the Chrome, which is not
open source because well--

00:02:05.880 --> 00:02:07.610
which contains not
open source bits.

00:02:07.610 --> 00:02:08.610
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.580
MALE SPEAKER: So
that has consequences

00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:13.850
on some of the features
that these browsers

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:14.730
are able to offer.

00:02:14.730 --> 00:02:18.510
So for example, Chromium
will lack a number of things

00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:21.840
because we're missing
those binary pieces we

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:22.700
have in the product.

00:02:22.700 --> 00:02:24.496
Do you want to talk about those?

00:02:24.496 --> 00:02:26.370
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So
before mentioning that,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:30.510
just two things that
people will understand.

00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:34.240
So there are Chromium
builds that are available

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.080
on
download-chromium.appspot.com.

00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:39.930
So basically, every day you
get several builds of Chromium

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:42.000
you can download and test.

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:45.160
And then you have the
Chromium browser package

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:47.830
that is maintained by
distribution maintainers.

00:02:47.830 --> 00:02:49.900
So you get one for
[INAUDIBLE] for [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.030
for all the Linux dispersion.

00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:57.360
You will see there
are some differences.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.580
First, like you said,
licensing stuff.

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:04.157
You don't have Adobe Flash
embedded in Chromium.

00:03:04.157 --> 00:03:05.490
MALE SPEAKER: So no Adobe Flash.

00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.325
No Adobe PDF either?

00:03:06.325 --> 00:03:07.950
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
No Adobe PDF either.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:08.580
Yeah.

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.540
It's a plug in.

00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:12.720
Basically the Chrome
team worked with Adobe

00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:16.750
to provide the best security
experience for users.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:17.950
That's in Google Chrome.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:21.030
That's not in Chromium.

00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:22.826
What else?

00:03:22.826 --> 00:03:23.700
MALE SPEAKER: Codecs.

00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:24.170
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Codecs obviously.

00:03:24.170 --> 00:03:25.044
MALE SPEAKER: Codecs.

00:03:25.044 --> 00:03:26.850
Audio and video codecs.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:31.280
So Chromium, obviously I'm
sure, will support things like--

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:33.700
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: VP8,
VPN9, Opus, [INAUDIBLE],

00:03:33.700 --> 00:03:36.370
all these different
source and great codecs

00:03:36.370 --> 00:03:38.530
are available in Chromium.

00:03:38.530 --> 00:03:40.830
But there are some
other great codecs

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.620
that you have to pay for.

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.220
And Google does it, and they
provide it in Google Chrome.

00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:52.460
So this is MP3, H264,
and AC, I believe.

00:03:52.460 --> 00:03:57.770
So if you don't know the
raw build of Chromium,

00:03:57.770 --> 00:03:59.970
you don't have access
to those codecs.

00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:03.380
But if you--

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:04.880
MALE SPEAKER: If
you access Chromium

00:04:04.880 --> 00:04:07.200
through one of the
Linux distributions,

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.050
maybe the maintainer
of that distribution

00:04:09.050 --> 00:04:11.950
has done the equivalent
work of Google

00:04:11.950 --> 00:04:14.250
to fill some of those gaps.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:15.004
Maybe not all.

00:04:15.004 --> 00:04:16.712
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT:
Not all, but some did.

00:04:16.712 --> 00:04:17.561
So it's cool.

00:04:17.561 --> 00:04:18.269
MALE SPEAKER: OK.

00:04:18.269 --> 00:04:21.730
So flash, PDF, codecs,
some differences here.

00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.750
Maybe another major difference
we should mention at this point

00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:29.020
is the update mechanism for the
bits that you have installed.

00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:31.960
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: And that's--
if you need to remember one

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:32.970
thing, that's the thing.

00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:37.400
Google Chrome updates
whenever it needs.

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:41.850
The push updates you, as
a user, to protect you.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:48.980
If you use Chromium, you rely
on the maintainer on yourself.

00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:53.260
There is a huge level of-- like
there's a huge gap of security

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:54.570
here.

00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:56.070
MALE SPEAKER: So
that's interesting.

00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:58.351
Maybe at this time we
should mention Canary.

00:04:58.351 --> 00:04:59.350
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:04:59.350 --> 00:05:02.650
So Chrome updates every
six weeks, roughly,

00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:05.330
for a stable version.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:07.120
Then you get Chromium.

00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:10.592
You can download a Chromium
build everyday if you want.

00:05:10.592 --> 00:05:12.050
MALE SPEAKER: Like
you do probably.

00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:12.281
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: Yeah.

00:05:12.281 --> 00:05:13.250
Like I do.

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:15.780
But maybe you don't
want to do that.

00:05:15.780 --> 00:05:19.640
You don't want to write
a base script for it.

00:05:19.640 --> 00:05:22.530
You can just use Canary.

00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.030
And Canary is basically Google
Chrome updated every day.

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:29.205
And this is where you should
test all the upcoming dev

00:05:29.205 --> 00:05:30.650
tools feature for instance.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.005
Or even just a Chrome feature.

00:05:32.005 --> 00:05:33.630
MALE SPEAKER: So if
you're a developer,

00:05:33.630 --> 00:05:36.340
typically you want to make sure
it works on the target, which

00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:38.150
is Google Chrome,
which everybody uses.

00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:41.400
But you probably want to test
on Canary as well, or maybe even

00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:44.150
on Chromium to see what's coming
down the line if there are

00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:47.700
new features you rely on that
are being added or changed.

00:05:47.700 --> 00:05:50.370
That's probably a good thing
to do, to test on those things.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:53.595
And they can all be installed
in the same machine, right?

00:05:53.595 --> 00:05:55.470
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So
one thing, at this time

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:58.525
Chrome Canary is not available
in Linux, just Windows and Mac.

00:05:58.525 --> 00:05:59.900
MALE SPEAKER: So
Windows and Mac.

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.930
That's probably
worth mentioning.

00:06:01.930 --> 00:06:05.550
One last big difference I
see is the syncing part,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:08.720
which is something where it
relies on the Google identity

00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.480
you can have in Google Chrome.

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:14.510
So that means you have access
to a number of synchronization

00:06:14.510 --> 00:06:17.930
features, the
profile, all of that

00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:20.800
is actually related
to the fact that you

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:22.460
can talk to Google services.

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:25.250
And that, obviously, is part
of the Google product, not

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:26.700
the open source project.

00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:31.580
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: So yeah,
but if you use some builds

00:06:31.580 --> 00:06:35.450
maintained by a Linux
dispersion, some embed API key,

00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:36.770
and you can do that.

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:37.603
MALE SPEAKER: Right.

00:06:37.603 --> 00:06:40.810
So that's the beauty of having
this open source project.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:42.430
People can add value.

00:06:42.430 --> 00:06:44.300
Google obviously
does its own product,

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.220
but others can do similar
things, or different things,

00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:50.130
and innovate in different
ways and add their own value

00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:51.710
on top of that.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.210
Cool.

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:54.460
So I think we've gone through
a number of differences.

00:06:54.460 --> 00:06:56.560
I hope it's more
clear for you than it

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.840
was before you
started watching this.

00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:00.170
Thanks for watching.

00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:02.000
I know it's clearer
for me before I

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:04.207
started talking to Francois.

00:07:04.207 --> 00:07:05.040
Thanks for watching.

00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.540
Cheers.

00:07:05.540 --> 00:07:07.630
FRANCOIS BEAUFORT: See you guys.
