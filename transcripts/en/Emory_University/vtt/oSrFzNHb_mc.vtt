00:00:05.569 --> 00:00:10.830
What happens if instead of there being
an acute infection or a good vaccine

00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:16.260
that gives you this long lived memory
responses... What will happen if you have

00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.199
a persistent infection -- that is. you have a
chronic infection, like you have in HIV,

00:00:21.199 --> 00:00:26.849
hepatitis B virus infection, or hepatitis
C virus infection, or you would have in

00:00:26.849 --> 00:00:32.040
many tumors ,because the tumor antigen is
there continuously. So in an acute

00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:36.180
infection setting, where the T-cell is
stimulated for a short period, it gets

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:40.680
all the right cues and all the
right buttons are pushed, so you generate

00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.600
these highly functional memory cells.
What would happen if that antigen does

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:49.969
not disappear and continues to 
stimulate the T-cell?

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.280
Before we made the discovery that T-cells are functionally exhausted it was known --

00:00:57.280 --> 00:01:01.420
work that actually we had done and many other
people had done -- that if there is a

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.270
chronic infection and you try
to measure a T-cell or even

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:10.720
sometimes a B-cell ,but certainly when you try
to measure a T-cell response against

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:14.950
that particular chronic infection,
you couldn't detect those cells by

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:19.780
functional assays. Those were
the only assays that were available.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:24.429
And the assumption was that either the T-cells
are not there or they were never generated.

00:01:24.429 --> 00:01:31.420
So the fact that there was a
decreased immune response against a

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.580
chronic pathogen was known. In fact we
had published a paper on this many years

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:45.490
back in the 1980s, but the basis for that
that - this non-responsiveness - was not known

00:01:45.490 --> 00:01:49.390
and most people had assumed that the T-cells
were not there, that they were deleted.

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.240
In fact that was a favorite hypotheses  - 
that you delete antigen reactive T-cells

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:59.799
or self-reactive T-cells 
in the thymus and

00:01:59.799 --> 00:02:04.180
so you have this clonal deletion 
and you don't have the T-cells.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.039
Or the  virus did something to inhibit the
generation of this T-cell response.

00:02:09.039 --> 00:02:14.410
So immune suppression by the virus to
inhibit the response or the deletion of

00:02:14.410 --> 00:02:18.970
these cells were the two major
mechanisms for not being able to control

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:22.930
a chronic infection. And that of course
also extended to the tumor setting.

00:02:22.930 --> 00:02:29.410
So we then again modeled these studies in in
the mouse model that we use to study the

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:34.840
good memory cell generation. 
So then we got a very interesting result.

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.510
We found that when there is a chronic
antigenic stimulation, the T-cells

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:46.390
actually get functionally exhausted, 
and that was a paradigm shift, because if

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:49.900
the T-cells are there, that means you can
try and fix things. If they're dead

00:02:49.900 --> 00:02:52.780
there's nothing you can do. If they were
not generated, there's not a whole lot

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.190
that you can do. So that was a paradigm
shift in terms of showing that the

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:00.730
T-cells are physically present but they're
dysfunctional. So the T-cells are

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:04.640
physically present, but now they're no
longer able

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:10.940
kill the infected target cell. They are
no longer able to secrete cytokines

00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:15.260
which have antiviral activities, both the
cytokine ability the ability secrete

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:19.100
cytokines which have antiviral effect -
that's lost - as well as the ability to

00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:23.630
kill the cells is lost. And also their
ability to proliferate and expand

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:28.550
greatly after antigen stimulation is lost.
So we defined - ours was the first group

00:03:28.550 --> 00:03:33.170
to define this T-cell exhaustion. 
This was a paper we published

00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:37.910
in 1998 actually. This is a paper that
was published from Emory University.

00:03:37.910 --> 00:03:43.100
Alan's Zajac who was a postdoc in the lab made this discovery that T-cells are

00:03:43.100 --> 00:03:48.709
present but they are dysfunctional and
are functionally exhausted.

00:03:48.709 --> 00:03:54.080
One of the joys I should say of science
is that if you kind of make an

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.780
interesting discovery and then see how
it moves forward. So for us the T-cell

00:03:59.780 --> 00:04:03.650
exhaustion part that Alan Zajac... 
There was excitement in the lab

00:04:03.650 --> 00:04:09.140
that we had made this discovery.
And allowing the possibility of maybe fixing

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.010
these cells. And then when Dan Barbara
did really that with I think with truly

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:18.799
seminal experiments, with the blockade,
there was huge huge excitement

00:04:18.799 --> 00:04:23.479
in the Dan Lab. Dan was really excited , everyone in
the lab was excited that we could do

00:04:23.479 --> 00:04:27.500
something so simple. The experiment
was very, very simple.

00:04:27.500 --> 00:04:32.960
We had a chronically infected mouse and all Dan
did was he injected some antibody to the

00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:38.720
mouse -- very unsophisticated experiment
that anybody could do - just a

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:43.190
single injection -- and then the result
really was quite striking.

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.520
After we reported the finding that T-cells
become functionally exhausted

00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:54.260
during chronic stimulation in this mouse
model, several other investigators at

00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:58.700
other places and also at Emory
University showed that the same finding

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:04.520
of T-cell exhaustion occurs in human infections.
So it was then shown that

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:10.280
people who are infected with HIV have
HIV specific cd8 T cells in their blood

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.520
that you can easily detect, that even in
their lymph nodes, when some some

00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:17.620
lymph node biopsies were done, but they are 
not able to kill the target cell,

00:05:17.620 --> 00:05:21.479
so they become dysfunctional.
Other investigators showed the same thing in

00:05:21.479 --> 00:05:27.129
chronic hepatitis C virus infection,
hepatitis B virus infection. So it became

00:05:27.129 --> 00:05:32.169
very quickly established that human
chronic viral infections like HIV, HCV

00:05:32.169 --> 00:05:37.030
HBV, which have very high levels of
antigen, high levels of virus and persist

00:05:37.030 --> 00:05:39.970
for the life of the individual, unless
they get treated by the appropriate

00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:44.770
drugs, okay ,you get this T cell
dysfunction. Also people at around the

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.229
same time who were working in cancer
models -- models in mice showed the

00:05:50.229 --> 00:05:55.479
same thing. They showed that there is T-cell
dysfunction in the T cells which

00:05:55.479 --> 00:05:59.050
infiltrated the tumor.
These cells are referred to as tumor

00:05:59.050 --> 00:06:03.819
tumor infiltrating lymphocytes -- TILs) is  the
abbreviation that's used. So it was shown

00:06:03.819 --> 00:06:08.110
that TILs also have this T-cell
dysfunction because of the chronic

00:06:08.110 --> 00:06:13.870
stimulation by the tumor antigens, and
then oncologists who were working with

00:06:13.870 --> 00:06:18.039
human cancer patients found the same
thing, so this phenomenon of T-cell

00:06:18.039 --> 00:06:24.880
exhaustion which was first described in
this mouse model that we use, it's a

00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:29.080
virus called lymphocytic Korea meningitis
virus -- you don't need to know worry about

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:33.250
what the name  is and what it does.
It can infect humans, it's really not

00:06:33.250 --> 00:06:37.479
but it's a wonderful wonderful 
mouse model to study many

00:06:37.479 --> 00:06:41.500
different aspects of the immune system. 
So these studies which came out of this LC MV

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:47.380
mouse model of tTcell exhaustion we
quickly extended into human cancer T-cells

00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:55.910
and in human chronic viral infections.
