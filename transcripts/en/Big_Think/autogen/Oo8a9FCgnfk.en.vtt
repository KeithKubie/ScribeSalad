00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:06.660
Ron you ask a very interesting question
in fact when I was in high school

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:06.670
in fact when I was in high school
 

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.790
in fact when I was in high school
I used to play with antimatter it turns

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.800
I used to play with antimatter it turns
 

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:11.009
I used to play with antimatter it turns
out the sodium 22 naturally emits

00:00:11.009 --> 00:00:11.019
out the sodium 22 naturally emits
 

00:00:11.019 --> 00:00:14.310
out the sodium 22 naturally emits
positrons are antielectrons I put the

00:00:14.310 --> 00:00:14.320
positrons are antielectrons I put the
 

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:17.250

antimatter inside a cloud chamber put it

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:17.260
antimatter inside a cloud chamber put it
 

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:20.610
antimatter inside a cloud chamber put it
into a 600 gasps magic field and clearly

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:20.620
into a 600 gasps magic field and clearly
 

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:23.520
into a 600 gasps magic field and clearly
the positrons were bending in the wrong

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:23.530
the positrons were bending in the wrong
 

00:00:23.530 --> 00:00:26.640
the positrons were bending in the wrong
direction in a magnetic field meaning

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:26.650
direction in a magnetic field meaning
 

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:29.160
direction in a magnetic field meaning
that positive electrons were being

00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:29.170
that positive electrons were being
 

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:32.339
that positive electrons were being
created in my cloud chamber later I

00:00:32.339 --> 00:00:32.349
created in my cloud chamber later I
 

00:00:32.349 --> 00:00:34.410
created in my cloud chamber later I
built an atom smasher in hopes of

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:34.420
built an atom smasher in hopes of
 

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:36.599
built an atom smasher in hopes of
getting a beam of antimatter

00:00:36.599 --> 00:00:36.609
getting a beam of antimatter
 

00:00:36.609 --> 00:00:39.209
getting a beam of antimatter
so antimatter has the opposite charge of

00:00:39.209 --> 00:00:39.219
so antimatter has the opposite charge of
 

00:00:39.219 --> 00:00:41.279
so antimatter has the opposite charge of
ordinary matter the antimatter that I

00:00:41.279 --> 00:00:41.289
ordinary matter the antimatter that I
 

00:00:41.289 --> 00:00:42.660

photographed in high school had a

00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:42.670
photographed in high school had a
 

00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:45.060
photographed in high school had a
positive charge electrons normally have

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:45.070
positive charge electrons normally have
 

00:00:45.070 --> 00:00:48.149
positive charge electrons normally have
a negative charge so anti electrons can

00:00:48.149 --> 00:00:48.159
a negative charge so anti electrons can
 

00:00:48.159 --> 00:00:50.910
a negative charge so anti electrons can
circulate around anti protons and we do

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:50.920
circulate around anti protons and we do
 

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.860

00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:06.480
starring Tom Hanks the whole novel was
based upon building an antimatter bomb

00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:06.490
based upon building an antimatter bomb
 

00:01:06.490 --> 00:01:08.639
based upon building an antimatter bomb
that might be able to destroy the

00:01:08.639 --> 00:01:08.649
that might be able to destroy the
 

00:01:08.649 --> 00:01:10.920

Vatican so if I have antimatter and

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:10.930
Vatican so if I have antimatter and
 

00:01:10.930 --> 00:01:13.560
Vatican so if I have antimatter and
according to the novel if I touch it

00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:13.570
according to the novel if I touch it
 

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:15.569
according to the novel if I touch it
with ordinary matter I would have

00:01:15.569 --> 00:01:15.579
with ordinary matter I would have
 

00:01:15.579 --> 00:01:18.120
with ordinary matter I would have
complete annihilation meaning that the

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:18.130
complete annihilation meaning that the
 

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:19.709
complete annihilation meaning that the
efficiency of the bomb would be about a

00:01:19.709 --> 00:01:19.719
efficiency of the bomb would be about a
 

00:01:19.719 --> 00:01:21.810
efficiency of the bomb would be about a
hundred times greater than the

00:01:21.810 --> 00:01:21.820
hundred times greater than the
 

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.779
hundred times greater than the
efficiency of a hydrogen bomb a hydrogen

00:01:24.779 --> 00:01:24.789
efficiency of a hydrogen bomb a hydrogen
 

00:01:24.789 --> 00:01:27.149
efficiency of a hydrogen bomb a hydrogen
bomb is only about 1% efficient an

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:27.159
bomb is only about 1% efficient an
 

00:01:27.159 --> 00:01:29.100
bomb is only about 1% efficient an
antimatter bomb would be a hundred

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:29.110
antimatter bomb would be a hundred
 

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:31.889
antimatter bomb would be a hundred
percent efficient so anti-people

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:31.899
percent efficient so anti-people
 

00:01:31.899 --> 00:01:35.580
percent efficient so anti-people
are also possible anti planets anti

00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:35.590
are also possible anti planets anti
 

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:38.310
are also possible anti planets anti
galaxies are also possible but the

00:01:38.310 --> 00:01:38.320
galaxies are also possible but the
 

00:01:38.320 --> 00:01:40.260
galaxies are also possible but the
danger is that if the two touch each

00:01:40.260 --> 00:01:40.270
danger is that if the two touch each
 

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.719
danger is that if the two touch each
other then they will annihilate into a

00:01:42.719 --> 00:01:42.729
other then they will annihilate into a
 

00:01:42.729 --> 00:01:45.690
other then they will annihilate into a
burst of energy however we've looked for

00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:45.700
burst of energy however we've looked for
 

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:47.609
burst of energy however we've looked for
antimatter in the universe we've looked

00:01:47.609 --> 00:01:47.619
antimatter in the universe we've looked
 

00:01:47.619 --> 00:01:49.889
antimatter in the universe we've looked
everywhere for antimatter and we see

00:01:49.889 --> 00:01:49.899
everywhere for antimatter and we see
 

00:01:49.899 --> 00:01:52.980
everywhere for antimatter and we see
very little antimatter in the galaxy

00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:52.990
very little antimatter in the galaxy
 

00:01:52.990 --> 00:01:55.260
very little antimatter in the galaxy
there's a fountain of antimatter coming

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:55.270
there's a fountain of antimatter coming
 

00:01:55.270 --> 00:01:56.669
there's a fountain of antimatter coming
out from the center of the Milky Way

00:01:56.669 --> 00:01:56.679
out from the center of the Milky Way
 

00:01:56.679 --> 00:01:58.679

galaxy in the direction of the
constellation Sagittarius however it's

00:02:01.109 --> 00:02:01.119
constellation Sagittarius however it's
 

00:02:01.119 --> 00:02:03.899
constellation Sagittarius however it's
very small and it leaves the mystery why

00:02:03.899 --> 00:02:03.909
very small and it leaves the mystery why
 

00:02:03.909 --> 00:02:06.330
very small and it leaves the mystery why
are we made out of matter and not

00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:06.340
are we made out of matter and not
 

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:09.210
are we made out of matter and not
antimatter why don't we meet anti people

00:02:09.210 --> 00:02:09.220
antimatter why don't we meet anti people
 

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.670

out there that's a big cosmological

beginning of the
 

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.770
beginning of the
universe at the Big Bang there were

00:02:17.770 --> 00:02:17.780
universe at the Big Bang there were
 

00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.410
universe at the Big Bang there were
almost equal amounts of matter and

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:20.420
almost equal amounts of matter and
 

00:02:20.420 --> 00:02:23.350
almost equal amounts of matter and
antimatter the two annihilated in the

00:02:23.350 --> 00:02:23.360
antimatter the two annihilated in the
 

00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.960
antimatter the two annihilated in the
instant of the Big Bang and we are the

00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:25.970
instant of the Big Bang and we are the
 

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:28.450

leftovers so everything you see around

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:28.460
leftovers so everything you see around
 

00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:31.960

us today we believe is a leftover from

us today we believe is a leftover from
 

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.180
us today we believe is a leftover from
the Titanic annihilation of matter and

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:34.190
the Titanic annihilation of matter and
 

00:02:34.190 --> 00:02:36.460
