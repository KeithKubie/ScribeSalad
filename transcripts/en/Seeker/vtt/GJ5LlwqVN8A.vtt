00:00:00.359 --> 00:00:05.560
German scientists have invented a material
that can conceal any object known to man.

00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:11.690
This will only be used for good....I hope.

00:00:11.690 --> 00:00:20.070
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and if it
isn't obvious already, the future is amazing.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.660
We have self-driving cars, we have robots
that can dance and sing.

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.710
But you know what we don't have enough of?

00:00:25.710 --> 00:00:26.710
Invisibility cloaks.

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:29.660
Until now - cause we JUST invented one.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:34.570
The fine people over at the Karlsruhe Institute
of Technology in Germany have created a polymer

00:00:34.570 --> 00:00:37.820
that can make any object invisible to the
sense of touch.

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.829
So when you lay it over something, it perfectly
adapts and absorbs the shape of whatever's

00:00:41.829 --> 00:00:42.829
underneath it.

00:00:42.829 --> 00:00:47.410
This example photo shows a tiny metal cylinder,
encased in this polymer - so no matter how

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:50.700
hard you press down on it, you won't be able
to feel the cylinder underneath.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:55.809
The polymer itself consists of a bunch of
tiny needle-shaped cones, whose tips meet

00:00:55.809 --> 00:01:00.490
to form a crystalline structure that encases
an object and makes it completely impervious

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:01.850
to detection.

00:01:01.850 --> 00:01:06.530
Even a force feedback mechanism won't be able
to determine the object hidden underneath.

00:01:06.530 --> 00:01:11.570
What's even cooler, is that each of those
tiny cones is constructed with sub-micrometer

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:17.020
accuracy, so by changing the size of the contact
points - you can theoretically create a material

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:19.610
with any kind of mechanical properties you
want.

00:01:19.610 --> 00:01:21.530
Even those not found in nature.

00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:25.330
The researchers who invented this say it was
developed purely for experimental purposes

00:01:25.330 --> 00:01:29.110
- but it does open up ideas for some interesting
new applications.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.020
One example they give - that I could totally
see myself using - is for camping.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:37.560
If you created a very thin mattress out of
this meta-material, it could completely absorb

00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.580
all of the twigs and jagged rocks underneath
it - so you'd have a completely smooth surface,

00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.049
with no indication you were even sleeping
on the ground.

00:01:45.049 --> 00:01:49.730
Of course, this IS brand new - so practical
applications are still a long ways off.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:50.730
But still!

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.070
Just think of all the things we could do with
this!

00:01:52.070 --> 00:01:57.479
I'm sure you guys have some awesome suggestions,
so as long as they don't involve couch cushions

00:01:57.479 --> 00:02:00.909
and several kilos of cocaine, feel free to
share em!

00:02:00.909 --> 00:02:04.450
Just leave em in the comments below, or you
can hit me up on Twitter at @TaraLongest.

00:02:04.450 --> 00:02:07.000
That's all for me, but as always - thank you
guys for watching!
