00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.470
PROFESSOR: OK.

00:00:21.470 --> 00:00:22.720
So.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:27.590
Last day we started looking at
phase diagrams, and we looked

00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.780
at unary phase diagrams, one
component systems, and one

00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:35.060
component system P versus T,
pressure versus temperature.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.130
And this is the situation
for water.

00:00:39.130 --> 00:00:42.370
Water is an exception, because
it's got this negative solid

00:00:42.370 --> 00:00:47.330
equals liquid coexistence curve,
but otherwise, you have

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.970
large, single-phase regions
here, which I've designated

00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:55.100
circle p equals 1, and then
along these lines, we have

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.310
equilibria.

00:00:56.310 --> 00:00:59.230
So this is liquid goes to vapor,
this is solid goes to

00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:01.410
liquid, this is solid
goes to vapor.

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:05.640
And we know that for water, if
we take the 1 atmosphere, if

00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.800
this is pressure in atmospheres,
the 1 atmosphere

00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.490
isobar, then that would put
this point at 100 degrees

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:16.470
Celsius, and this point
at 0 Celsius.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.420
And then we have the triple
point, which is solid equals

00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:27.620
liquid equals vapor at 0.01
degrees C, and p equals, I

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:31.920
think it was 4.58 millimeters
of mercury.

00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:35.030
So that's the triple point.

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:39.720
And we looked at a variety of
other one-component phase

00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.670
diagrams, and I think we
came to a pretty good

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:46.370
understanding.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:48.540
And then up here, we have the
supercritical fluids.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:50.430
So I've got a break
in the line here.

00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:55.640
And for water, you reach
supercriticality at 374

00:01:55.640 --> 00:02:03.230
degrees Celsius, and up here
at 218 atmospheres.

00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.990
So these are not phenomenal,
these are not geological

00:02:05.990 --> 00:02:07.630
pressures at all.

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:11.530
And so that's if we want to
the decaffeinating of

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:12.440
coffee and so on.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:14.960
And so what happens here, is you
have a highly compressed

00:02:14.960 --> 00:02:18.410
vapor or a highly rarefied
liquid, and you end up with

00:02:18.410 --> 00:02:21.690
solubilizing power of a
liquid, but transport

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:22.720
properties of a gas.

00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:25.700
So this stuff has really
good diffusivity.

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:28.880
So it can penetrate into
interstices and do its work

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.220
very quickly, to say nothing of
the fact that you're up at

00:02:31.220 --> 00:02:34.760
374 degrees Celsius or higher.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.130
So today what I want to do,
is I want to look at

00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:44.280
two-component systems. So
component number is circle c,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:45.540
c equals 2.

00:02:45.540 --> 00:02:48.610
So that means now I have
to deal with pressure,

00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.240
temperature, and lowercase
c is composition.

00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:55.070
I want to know how things
vary with composition.

00:02:55.070 --> 00:02:56.180
So let me give you an example.

00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:59.010
Suppose I have two substances,
A and B.

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:02.820
So here's substance A, and I've
got its one-component

00:03:02.820 --> 00:03:03.620
phase diagram.

00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.670
And in this case, I'm going to
put solid-liquid vapor in the

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:10.830
conventional setting, where
the solid-liquid line is--

00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:13.140
the coexistence curve has
a positive slope.

00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.690
So this is A, and let's say I've
got B over here, and it's

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:20.450
got its solid-liquid coexistence
curve, and so

00:03:20.450 --> 00:03:24.120
we've got its melting
point, and whatever.

00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:26.210
So now the question I want
to ask is, what happens

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:28.390
if I mix A and B?

00:03:28.390 --> 00:03:32.790
And let's just say, here's the
melting point of A, so this is

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:35.380
at p equals 1 atmosphere.

00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:37.130
And here's the melting
point of B.

00:03:37.130 --> 00:03:39.450
And I want to ask the question,
how does the melting

00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:41.890
point of the mixture vary?

00:03:41.890 --> 00:03:45.020
So let's say I'm going to
connect these, and I want to

00:03:45.020 --> 00:03:48.170
ask, what happens if I've
got an AB mixture?

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:50.240
So I'm going to put lowercase
c here, which is

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:51.560
concentration.

00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:54.320
So at the one end, I've got 100%
A, and over here, I've

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:57.130
got 100% B, and I know
those melting points.

00:03:57.130 --> 00:03:59.040
Question is, what happens
when I mix them?

00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:01.180
Does the melting point-- is
it just a straight line?

00:04:01.180 --> 00:04:02.770
Is it a linear variation?

00:04:02.770 --> 00:04:04.160
Do you go through
a local maximum?

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.180
Do you go through
a local minimum?

00:04:06.180 --> 00:04:07.240
Or do you go wild?

00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.560
I mean, what happens?

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:11.620
So a question you might ask
is, suppose I made a 50-50

00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:15.530
alloy of 50% A and 50% B.

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:18.660
If I knew the end-member
melting points, could I

00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:19.850
predict this?

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:21.870
Or if not, do I have
an archive?

00:04:21.870 --> 00:04:24.920
Remember the phase diagram
compendium is an archive.

00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:27.170
What is the value
of the melting

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.320
point at 50-50 or 75-25?

00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.400
So that's the question
I want to ask.

00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.900
Now this is getting really
messy, because now I have to

00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:41.320
plot pressure, and I have to
plot temperature, and I have

00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:43.720
to plot composition.

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:46.000
So this is really
crazy, right?

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.870
I've got pressure, and I'm
going to have composition

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.020
here, and I'm going to have
to have now a third

00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:52.020
axis, aren't I?

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:53.710
I'm going to have to
have a third axis.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:55.230
I'm going to need a
temperature axis.

00:04:55.230 --> 00:04:57.700
And I've got to make a
three-dimensional drawing.

00:04:57.700 --> 00:04:59.370
And this is messy.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:07.730
But we're in luck, because 3091
is solid state chemistry.

00:05:07.730 --> 00:05:10.750
So as solid state chemists,
we're more interested in what

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:12.480
happens in the solid here.

00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:15.080
Now, I've drawn these lines
with a slope, but they're

00:05:15.080 --> 00:05:16.370
really not to scale.

00:05:16.370 --> 00:05:20.140
It turns out that, you know, you
can move 10,000 feet up or

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:24.280
down in the atmosphere and have
a huge variation in the

00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.100
boiling point because this
line is shallow.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.360
But this line is virtually
straight up and down.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.170
You have to go to geological
pressures to change the

00:05:32.170 --> 00:05:34.160
melting point very much.

00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.370
And so, as a result, this
is almost insensitive to

00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:40.900
pressure, to first
order, right?

00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:48.380
So we can say solid equals
liquid is almost insensitive

00:05:48.380 --> 00:05:55.790
to pressure, whereas liquid
equals vapor is very sensitive

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:57.760
very sensitive to pressure.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:00.260
But we don't care about
this so much.

00:06:00.260 --> 00:06:02.110
So what I'm going to do
is throw it away.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.990
I'm going to throw it away, and
just say, let's look at

00:06:06.990 --> 00:06:10.120
just T versus C.

00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:13.490
Temperature versus composition
on the strength of the fact

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:18.800
that the melting point and all
of these things are mildly

00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:20.440
dependent on pressure.

00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440
All right.

00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:23.640
So now I'm going to give you
three different types.

00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:26.180
There's many, many different
types of binary phase diagram.

00:06:26.180 --> 00:06:28.420
So now we're going to be
looking at C equals 2.

00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.210
So instead of a unary, this is
going to be called binary.

00:06:32.210 --> 00:06:36.330
Binary phase diagrams. And they
come in all shapes and

00:06:36.330 --> 00:06:38.720
sizes, but they can
pretty much be

00:06:38.720 --> 00:06:40.970
classified in several bins.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:43.550
And I've made the
classification.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:51.990
So classify binary
phase diagrams

00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:55.252
according to their bonding.

00:06:55.252 --> 00:06:58.360
It all comes back electronic
structure and bonding.

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:02.810
Vary by bonding.

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:04.860
Because bonding, then,
ultimately indicates

00:07:04.860 --> 00:07:06.670
solubility, and that's what
we're looking at here.

00:07:06.670 --> 00:07:09.640
We're going to look at how well
A dissolves into B, and

00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:11.540
how well B dissolves into A.

00:07:11.540 --> 00:07:12.790
That dictates solubility.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.630
So it all comes full circle.

00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:21.830
So I've made this up.

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:23.080
You're now going to find
this in the book.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.800
So I just decided, for ease of
teaching 3091, is I'm going to

00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:29.120
just give the different types.

00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.330
And so I call them type one,
type two, and type three.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:32.830
You're not going to find
that in the books.

00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:35.010
I made that up, because
it's simple.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.820
So type one.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:38.850
What's type one binary phase
diagram, according to me?

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:40.100
What is the type one?

00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:42.040
It means complete solubility.

00:07:46.790 --> 00:07:50.460
So A and B are completely
soluble in one another as

00:07:50.460 --> 00:07:51.710
solid and liquids.

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.780
That's the first thing
that you'll see on a

00:07:57.780 --> 00:07:59.290
type one phase diagram.

00:07:59.290 --> 00:08:03.360
And the second one is, a change
of state is present.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.160
And you know the only change of
state we care about here is

00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:07.550
solid goes to liquid.

00:08:07.550 --> 00:08:10.835
So we're going to show solid
goes to liquid, and the thing

00:08:10.835 --> 00:08:15.360
is totally, as they say in
California, totally soluble as

00:08:15.360 --> 00:08:16.660
liquids and solids.

00:08:16.660 --> 00:08:20.120
Now, here's some bonding rules
that you can think about.

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:22.850
So what would be the
characteristics of two

00:08:22.850 --> 00:08:25.900
substances A and B that would
give complete solid

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:26.880
solubility?

00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:31.010
Well, one thing is they'd have
to have identical crystal

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:32.320
structures.

00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.280
That would heighten the
chances of this.

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.780
Identical crystal structures.

00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:40.480
So if they're both FCC metals,
you've got a better chance of

00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:45.890
making an infinite variation in
solution composition than

00:08:45.890 --> 00:08:49.080
if one is an FCC metal and the
other is a BCC metal because

00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.160
FCC will just sit on
the lattice site.

00:08:52.160 --> 00:08:53.850
But there's more fine
structures.

00:08:53.850 --> 00:09:00.620
Second one is similar
atomic volumes.

00:09:00.620 --> 00:09:03.370
So if we're going to have a
substitutional solid solution,

00:09:03.370 --> 00:09:05.950
let's make sure we're replacing
oranges with

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:09.360
oranges, and not trying to put
a grapefruit on a site that

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:11.405
normally is occupied by a lemon,
because there's going

00:09:11.405 --> 00:09:13.460
to be a size restriction
there.

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.100
And the third thing is, even if
they have identical crystal

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:19.740
structures and similar atomic
volumes, you can still run

00:09:19.740 --> 00:09:22.870
into trouble with respect to
complete solid solubility if

00:09:22.870 --> 00:09:26.910
you have a large variation
in electronegativity.

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:28.500
And I'll show you an
example of that.

00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:30.090
So if you have a small
difference in

00:09:30.090 --> 00:09:32.980
electronegativity, it means
there's a low propensity for

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:37.410
polarity, and ultimately no
chance of electron transfer.

00:09:37.410 --> 00:09:39.510
So I think it's pretty cool.

00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:41.930
So I wrote those down, but was
disappointed to learn that for

00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:45.870
metals, they were enunciated
about 75 years ago by the

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:47.910
British metallurgist
Hume-Rothery.

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:50.560
So I can't take credit
for this.

00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:51.420
This is one name.

00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.170
It's one of these hyphenated
British names.

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:57.090
He's Sir da-da-da-da
Hume-Rothery.

00:09:57.090 --> 00:09:59.590
So he has the Hume-Rothery
Rule.

00:09:59.590 --> 00:10:05.590
And he called such systems that
mix as binaries forming

00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:11.860
isomorphous, meaning they
have the same structure.

00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.010
So let's take a look at the
prototypical isomorphous phase

00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:18.010
diagram, and it looks
like this.

00:10:18.010 --> 00:10:20.860
We're plotting temperature
versus composition.

00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:22.750
We threw away the pressure
coordinate.

00:10:22.750 --> 00:10:25.770
So I got pure A on the left,
pure B on the right.

00:10:25.770 --> 00:10:28.570
Little c is concentration,
so it varies from

00:10:28.570 --> 00:10:31.210
100% A to 100% B.

00:10:31.210 --> 00:10:34.370
And the vertical axis
is temperature.

00:10:34.370 --> 00:10:37.850
So one extreme, I've got
the melting point--

00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.270
this is a melting
point of pure A.

00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.980
And at the other extreme,
I've got the melting

00:10:41.980 --> 00:10:44.020
point of pure B.

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:47.775
So that, we know.

00:10:47.775 --> 00:10:51.200
And now the question is, how
does melting point vary as a

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:52.520
function of composition?

00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:58.540
And for an isomorphous phase
diagram, it looks like this:

00:10:58.540 --> 00:11:01.000
lens-shaped.

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.210
Up here is all liquid.

00:11:05.210 --> 00:11:07.550
You see A and B mix in
all proportions.

00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:09.020
And down here is all solid.

00:11:12.730 --> 00:11:17.410
And furthermore, it's an
all-liquid solution.

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:17.890
It's a mixture.

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:19.660
And this is an all-solid
solution.

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:28.940
And then comes the piece
that if you take enough

00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.900
thermodynamics, you'll be
able to rationalize.

00:11:30.900 --> 00:11:33.520
I'm simply going to tell you
without proof that when you

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:38.800
have a multicomponent system,
when c is greater than 1-- so

00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:40.090
we're in that situation.

00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:41.840
Now, c is 2.

00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:52.160
When c is greater than 1, it is
impossible to move from one

00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.880
field, up here, this is--

00:11:53.880 --> 00:11:55.840
I'd better put the label
on it-- this is a

00:11:55.840 --> 00:11:57.390
single-phase field.

00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:01.970
So up here, p equals 1, because
it's homogeneous

00:12:01.970 --> 00:12:04.580
liquid solution, p equals 1.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.050
When you're in pure materials,
you can go

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:07.140
from solid to liquid.

00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:09.240
But when you're in a
two-component system, you

00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:12.770
cannot move from one
single-phase field to a second

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.700
single-phase field
without moving

00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:16.820
through a two-phase field.

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:22.300
And we'll get to that, what it
means to move from one field

00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:32.860
of p equals 1 to another field
of p equals 1 requires

00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:45.270
traverse or transit across
a field of p equals 2.

00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.360
And so what's in here has
to be the end member.

00:12:47.360 --> 00:12:50.970
So this must be liquid
plus solid.

00:12:50.970 --> 00:12:54.080
So I'm going to call it slush.

00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.660
They have a slush in here.

00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:01.660
The other terminology that
people give this is, it's

00:13:01.660 --> 00:13:02.900
lens-shaped, right?

00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:04.100
Looks like a lens.

00:13:04.100 --> 00:13:06.150
So let's call this lens shape.

00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:07.570
So we're going to use
the Latin word for

00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:09.760
lens, which is lens.

00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.670
But we want to make
it adjectival.

00:13:11.670 --> 00:13:13.820
So we're going to use
the adjective--

00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:17.020
what's the genetive
form of lens?

00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:17.640
Lentis?

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.360
So we will call this
lenticular.

00:13:20.360 --> 00:13:21.740
This is lenticular.

00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:25.280
The phase diagram has
a lenticular shape.

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.530
Looks like a lens.

00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:32.760
And you know, just as over here,
I showed you, every line

00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:35.510
represents a coexistence
curve, right?

00:13:35.510 --> 00:13:37.680
The lines are all coexistence
curves.

00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:39.830
These lines are coexistence
curves.

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:43.740
The line up here is liquid
equals vapor, so this one must

00:13:43.740 --> 00:13:46.570
be the coexistence of the two
things on either side.

00:13:46.570 --> 00:13:47.530
So what do I have here?

00:13:47.530 --> 00:13:48.330
I have liquid.

00:13:48.330 --> 00:13:49.650
Here I have slush.

00:13:49.650 --> 00:13:50.750
So I'm going to write that.

00:13:50.750 --> 00:13:54.240
So I'm going to write the
equilibrium, liquid goes to

00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:55.890
liquid plus solid.

00:13:55.890 --> 00:13:58.810
And this line, this coexistence
curve, it's called

00:13:58.810 --> 00:14:01.650
the liquidus line.

00:14:06.950 --> 00:14:11.730
This is the liquidus
equilibrium, the liquidus

00:14:11.730 --> 00:14:13.690
coexistence curve, and so on.

00:14:13.690 --> 00:14:14.800
And so what's the liquidus?

00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:16.800
The liquidus is the lowest
temperature.

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.370
So you pick a composition.

00:14:18.370 --> 00:14:21.200
The liquidus is the lowest
temperature at which you can

00:14:21.200 --> 00:14:24.490
have a single-phase liquid
solution, OK?

00:14:24.490 --> 00:14:26.730
So liquidus equilibrium.

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:39.610
And the liquidus is the lowest
temperature at which all

00:14:39.610 --> 00:14:43.185
liquid is stable.

00:14:43.185 --> 00:14:45.830
You go below that temperature at
that composition, you start

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:48.630
making solid, because slush
requires that there be some

00:14:48.630 --> 00:14:50.190
solid present.

00:14:50.190 --> 00:14:53.960
And then the lower line, it also
is a coexistence curve.

00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:55.400
So on the one side,
I've got solid.

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:57.300
On the other side,
I've got slush.

00:14:57.300 --> 00:14:58.570
So I'm going to write
that one down.

00:14:58.570 --> 00:15:02.790
That solid goes to liquid
plus solid.

00:15:02.790 --> 00:15:07.850
And that's called the solidus
equilibrium, or that's the

00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:10.830
solidus line, the solidus
coexistence curve, and the

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:11.790
solidus is the complement.

00:15:11.790 --> 00:15:14.920
The solidus is the highest
temperature at which you can

00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.945
have all solid present.

00:15:15.945 --> 00:15:19.340
So you pick a composition, and
I'll tell you what the highest

00:15:19.340 --> 00:15:21.270
temperature is at which
you'll have a

00:15:21.270 --> 00:15:23.100
single-phase solid solution.

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:33.820
So solidus is the highest
temperature at which

00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:39.310
all solid is stable.

00:15:39.310 --> 00:15:40.930
All right.

00:15:40.930 --> 00:15:41.210
Good.

00:15:41.210 --> 00:15:43.320
And I'm going to look at
a few of these things.

00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.550
It's always fun to see if
I'm on track with the

00:15:46.550 --> 00:15:47.330
Hume-Rothery rule.

00:15:47.330 --> 00:15:50.650
So here's copper nickel.

00:15:50.650 --> 00:15:52.420
They're both FCC metals.

00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:55.990
So we've got copper melting at
about 1085, nickel melting at

00:15:55.990 --> 00:15:57.220
about 1455.

00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:01.020
And there's the phase diagram,
lenticular phase diagram.

00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:03.530
So up here is all liquid,
and then--

00:16:03.530 --> 00:16:05.490
this is all metallurgy
terminology.

00:16:05.490 --> 00:16:11.740
A solid solution of A and
B, they call alpha.

00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:13.690
Metallurgist looks at that, goes
oh, it must be a solid

00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:15.130
solution, OK?

00:16:15.130 --> 00:16:17.230
So there's p equals
2 in between,

00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.740
p equals 1, p equals--

00:16:19.740 --> 00:16:21.330
Here's a ceramic system.

00:16:21.330 --> 00:16:24.030
This is nickel oxide,
magnesium oxide.

00:16:24.030 --> 00:16:26.890
It's not metals, but they have
identical crystal structures,

00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:28.800
very similar atomic volumes.

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:31.990
They're ions, so we have
nickel and magnesium

00:16:31.990 --> 00:16:35.440
substituting for one another
on the cationic sublattice.

00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:38.750
So they must have very
nearly equal sizes.

00:16:38.750 --> 00:16:42.010
If I look at this, and I see a
lenticular diagram, it means

00:16:42.010 --> 00:16:44.080
they must have similar atomic
volumes, which means the

00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:47.230
dominant defect in here must
be Schottky, not Frankel

00:16:47.230 --> 00:16:50.380
because Frankel needs a big
difference in atomic volume.

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.520
If you have a big difference in
atomic volume, we wouldn't

00:16:52.520 --> 00:16:54.410
have a lenticular
phase diagram.

00:16:54.410 --> 00:16:57.530
So here's-- mag oxide melts at
2800 degrees centigrade.

00:16:57.530 --> 00:16:58.430
It's a great refractory.

00:16:58.430 --> 00:17:00.220
You can hold molten
iron in it.

00:17:00.220 --> 00:17:02.670
And here's nickel
oxide down here.

00:17:02.670 --> 00:17:02.870
All right.

00:17:02.870 --> 00:17:03.770
Here's an interesting one.

00:17:03.770 --> 00:17:04.670
This is gold nickel.

00:17:04.670 --> 00:17:06.220
Both FCC metals.

00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:09.020
Shade your eyes from
the lower part.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:10.420
Just look at the upper part.

00:17:10.420 --> 00:17:11.670
It looks lenticular.

00:17:13.750 --> 00:17:15.310
It's what you'd expect,
gold and nickel.

00:17:15.310 --> 00:17:17.980
They're both, you know,
card-bearing metals.

00:17:17.980 --> 00:17:21.940
But you've seen already, with
the cesium-gold, gold has a

00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:25.040
fairly high electronegativity.

00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:28.640
And what happens is that you
get over here, at about 33

00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:35.320
atomic percent of nickel in
gold, you have an atomic ratio

00:17:35.320 --> 00:17:38.310
that allows to have something
that starting to approximate

00:17:38.310 --> 00:17:39.250
electron transfer.

00:17:39.250 --> 00:17:41.640
So it's almost as though you
have a lenticular phase

00:17:41.640 --> 00:17:46.880
diagram between pure nickel and
this nickel-gold compound.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:49.750
But up in here, it's nice
lenticular stuff.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:50.400
All right.

00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:51.970
What's the next one?

00:17:51.970 --> 00:17:52.300
Oh, yeah.

00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:54.690
So now I want to go in and I
want to start talking about

00:17:54.690 --> 00:17:56.270
what goes on inside here.

00:17:56.270 --> 00:17:59.780
So what I'm going to do, is
I'm going to blow this up.

00:17:59.780 --> 00:18:04.000
And I'm going to start at 40%,
40 weight percent nickel, and

00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.100
I'm going to say, what happens
if we take a crucible that's

00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:11.330
40 weight percent nickel and
copper, and we cool it from

00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:16.810
all liquid at 1300, down to all
solid at 1200, pausing in

00:18:16.810 --> 00:18:18.800
that slush zone at 1250?

00:18:18.800 --> 00:18:21.000
So we're going to take snapshots
and say, what's the

00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.870
contents of the crucible look
like at 1300, at 1250, and at

00:18:24.870 --> 00:18:29.030
1200, and come out of it, have
an appreciation for what all

00:18:29.030 --> 00:18:30.570
of this stuff means.

00:18:30.570 --> 00:18:33.590
So let's start our experiment.

00:18:33.590 --> 00:18:36.400
So we're going to have
three crucibles here.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:48.560
And we're going to start with
40% nickel in copper, and

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:52.880
that's going to be the
experiment we'll perform.

00:18:52.880 --> 00:18:55.990
So I've got three crucibles.

00:18:55.990 --> 00:19:00.830
And so if I look at the phase
diagram, here I am.

00:19:00.830 --> 00:19:07.690
This was 1300 degrees C, this
was at 1250 degrees C, and

00:19:07.690 --> 00:19:10.990
then this was at
1200 degrees C.

00:19:10.990 --> 00:19:13.450
So at 1300, that's trivial.

00:19:13.450 --> 00:19:17.170
1300 for this thing, it should
be just all liquid.

00:19:17.170 --> 00:19:18.780
And maybe it's copper.

00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:21.590
I know at this temperature,
it's going to be blinding

00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:22.560
white heat.

00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:23.310
So it doesn't matter.

00:19:23.310 --> 00:19:24.000
I could use this.

00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.252
But I felt compelled, it's one
of those rare opportunities to

00:19:26.252 --> 00:19:27.140
use colored chalk.

00:19:27.140 --> 00:19:29.730
So I want this to sort
of be copper-colored.

00:19:29.730 --> 00:19:31.940
The meniscus is going to look
like this, because the liquid

00:19:31.940 --> 00:19:33.680
metals have a very high
surface tension.

00:19:33.680 --> 00:19:34.910
They want to ball up.

00:19:34.910 --> 00:19:36.850
So you're going to have a
meniscus looking like this,

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:43.100
and this is all single
phase, all liquid.

00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:45.640
And over here, I'm going
to do the easy one.

00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:48.440
If we get down to 1200, it's
all solid state, right?

00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:51.220
At 1200, I'm going to end up
with something that's solid,

00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:57.040
and it's going to be
polycrystalline, and these are

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.180
all going to be grains
of alpha.

00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.220
All solid.

00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.500
And I'm going to label all of
these as alpha solid solution.

00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:09.600
They all have the same
composition, which is 40%

00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.830
nickel in copper.

00:20:15.490 --> 00:20:18.850
And these are all 40% nickel.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:21.930
Now, according to this phase
diagram, when we get down into

00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:24.530
the center there, something
else happens.

00:20:24.530 --> 00:20:27.150
We end up in a two-phase
regime.

00:20:27.150 --> 00:20:30.740
And that two-phase regime is
a regime in which certain

00:20:30.740 --> 00:20:34.490
compositions are forbidden
because that's an equilibrium.

00:20:34.490 --> 00:20:37.440
It doesn't allow us to have
what's in between.

00:20:37.440 --> 00:20:41.840
I think the next slide
actually shows this.

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:49.800
So what I've designated
as c2 is this 40%.

00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:54.260
So c2 is now going to park at
that point in the middle.

00:20:54.260 --> 00:20:54.850
Whoops!

00:20:54.850 --> 00:20:56.730
Want to get into that.

00:20:56.730 --> 00:20:58.080
So here's where we are.

00:20:58.080 --> 00:21:00.950
We're in the center of that
two-phase regime.

00:21:00.950 --> 00:21:02.200
So this is the solidus.

00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.770
This is the liquidus.

00:21:08.850 --> 00:21:10.940
And we're at 1250.

00:21:10.940 --> 00:21:12.190
t equals--

00:21:15.040 --> 00:21:16.740
And we're at this value.

00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:19.580
We started at c2,
which is 40%.

00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:24.370
But in this regime,
40% is forbidden.

00:21:24.370 --> 00:21:28.660
If you stop at 40% at 1250,
this says that the stable

00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:31.820
phases are a liquid
and a solid.

00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:35.460
But the liquid has less nickel
in it, and the solid has more

00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:36.530
nickel in it.

00:21:36.530 --> 00:21:38.230
It's like if this is
a solubility limit.

00:21:38.230 --> 00:21:41.290
In other words, if you started
at pure copper, and you

00:21:41.290 --> 00:21:43.560
started adding nickel, you can
keep adding nickel until you

00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:45.150
get to this concentration.

00:21:45.150 --> 00:21:47.000
You try to add any more nickel,
it's like adding too

00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.130
much sugar to water.

00:21:48.130 --> 00:21:49.310
What do you have?

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:51.100
The stuff just falls to
the bottom of the

00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.730
cup, doesn't dissolve.

00:21:52.730 --> 00:21:53.690
That's this.

00:21:53.690 --> 00:21:54.530
It's the solid.

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:57.710
Only instead of being pure
nickel, it's still a copper

00:21:57.710 --> 00:21:59.600
nickel solution, but
kind of rich.

00:21:59.600 --> 00:22:01.710
So I'm going to call
this c star.

00:22:01.710 --> 00:22:05.240
It's the solubility limit
on the liquid side.

00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:08.650
And this one here I'm going to
call c star on the solid side.

00:22:08.650 --> 00:22:11.130
In other words, I could start
from this side, and keep

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:14.520
adding copper to nickel, and I
make a homogeneous alloy until

00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.910
I get to this composition.

00:22:15.910 --> 00:22:19.080
If I try to add any more
copper, I jump across.

00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.900
So we're here in the middle.

00:22:20.900 --> 00:22:23.050
But now, isn't there something
strange here?

00:22:23.050 --> 00:22:27.450
It's saying I'm going to have
a liquid that's nickel-poor

00:22:27.450 --> 00:22:29.100
and a solid that's
nickel-rich.

00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:32.230
And I'm just putting up here
what the diagram says.

00:22:32.230 --> 00:22:35.310
And we know that FCC metals,
which is denser, the

00:22:35.310 --> 00:22:37.610
liquid or the solid?

00:22:37.610 --> 00:22:38.200
The solid.

00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:43.430
So down here I'm going to have
alpha, OK, a bunch of grains

00:22:43.430 --> 00:22:47.850
of alpha solid solution, and up
here, I'm going to have a

00:22:47.850 --> 00:22:49.700
liquid solution.

00:22:49.700 --> 00:22:53.310
And the composition here is
c star liquid, and the

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:56.150
composition here is
c star solid.

00:22:56.150 --> 00:22:57.900
It's different composition
from this.

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:02.270
Here the composition is equal
to c2, or the 40% nickel.

00:23:02.270 --> 00:23:04.640
So I've got disproportionation.

00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.610
But the total mass, I can't
have sources or sinks.

00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:10.010
So I have to conserve mass.

00:23:10.010 --> 00:23:12.820
So I'm going to ask you to
just do the algebra.

00:23:12.820 --> 00:23:14.760
You've got two equations
and two unknowns.

00:23:14.760 --> 00:23:17.730
I know what the n-member
concentrations are.

00:23:17.730 --> 00:23:19.930
They're given by the
n's of this thing

00:23:19.930 --> 00:23:21.780
called the tie line.

00:23:21.780 --> 00:23:25.170
The tie line ties the two ends
of the two-phase region

00:23:25.170 --> 00:23:27.830
together, and then we just
do a mass balance.

00:23:27.830 --> 00:23:29.590
Well, fortunately, the
metallurgists have thought

00:23:29.590 --> 00:23:31.890
about this for a while, so we
don't have to go through and

00:23:31.890 --> 00:23:35.210
figure out, well, if two
apples cost 15 cents--

00:23:35.210 --> 00:23:36.780
we don't have to do that
kind of thing.

00:23:36.780 --> 00:23:42.580
We can just invoke the lever
rule, and it will tell us how

00:23:42.580 --> 00:23:46.610
much of the liquid that's
nickel-depleted and solid

00:23:46.610 --> 00:23:49.060
that's nickel-rich
add up to this.

00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:52.320
And so let's look at
the lever rule.

00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:55.320
Basically what's going to happen
here is that the stuff

00:23:55.320 --> 00:24:04.870
that started off as 40% nickel,
60% copper, that's my

00:24:04.870 --> 00:24:10.700
initial mix, it's going to
break into two layers.

00:24:10.700 --> 00:24:13.560
It's going to break into a
liquid layer, which, if you go

00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:17.230
to the phase diagram, looks like
it's about 38% nickel and

00:24:17.230 --> 00:24:20.255
68% copper, and that's
what we're going

00:24:20.255 --> 00:24:22.890
to call c star liquid.

00:24:22.890 --> 00:24:32.030
And then over here it's 45%
percent nickel and 55% copper.

00:24:32.030 --> 00:24:36.200
And that's what we call
c star of the solid.

00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.890
And so it's just a lever.

00:24:37.890 --> 00:24:39.100
So there's c star.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.500
This is the c2 that we want.

00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:44.600
And we want to ask, what's the
relative amount of the liquid

00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:46.630
phase and the solid phase?

00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:49.460
And why they call it a lever
rule is, look, if you cooled

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.170
something that was at
this composition, it

00:24:51.170 --> 00:24:53.190
would be 100% liquid.

00:24:53.190 --> 00:24:55.530
And if you cooled something at
this composition, it will be

00:24:55.530 --> 00:24:56.700
100% solid.

00:24:56.700 --> 00:24:58.530
And so it's going
to be a constant

00:24:58.530 --> 00:25:00.420
variation across here.

00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:02.920
So you use, you take this, and
you know, and I want this

00:25:02.920 --> 00:25:06.260
amount, I'm taking this versus
this, kind of thing.

00:25:06.260 --> 00:25:08.460
It's a lever construction.

00:25:08.460 --> 00:25:09.510
So we'll just put it down.

00:25:09.510 --> 00:25:21.400
So the percent of the liquid
in the crucible at 1250--

00:25:21.400 --> 00:25:22.920
and then this is a
general thing.

00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:26.180
Whenever p equals 2, you'll
use a lever rule.

00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:30.590
Percent of the liquid is
given by this one.

00:25:30.590 --> 00:25:33.760
The composition of the solid
at the end of the tie line

00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:36.030
minus the composition
that you started at.

00:25:36.030 --> 00:25:41.240
This is your bulk initial
concentration, divided by the

00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.460
length of that tie line.

00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:48.200
c star solid minus
c star liquid.

00:25:48.200 --> 00:25:50.990
And then multiplied by 100%.

00:25:50.990 --> 00:25:54.850
So you get a percent, and the
number here is going to be 45

00:25:54.850 --> 00:26:01.850
minus 40 over 45 minus 32,
and that works out--

00:26:01.850 --> 00:26:06.530
going to multiply by 100, or
else there will be complaints.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:09.290
And then this turns
out to be 38%.

00:26:09.290 --> 00:26:11.890
So what that means is that
if you take this

00:26:11.890 --> 00:26:15.320
amount of liquid here--

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.320
pardon me-- based on
conservation of mass, if you

00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:28.790
drop and hold at 1250, 38% of
that volume is now sitting

00:26:28.790 --> 00:26:35.470
here in the liquid, which means
62% of it by volume has

00:26:35.470 --> 00:26:36.940
turned into solid.

00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.620
And the composition here is
different from the composition

00:26:39.620 --> 00:26:44.380
here, but if you add up all the
nickel in the crucible and

00:26:44.380 --> 00:26:48.180
sum it versus all the copper in
the crucible, you still end

00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:49.855
up with 40% net nickel.

00:26:49.855 --> 00:26:52.740
So this very powerful.

00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:55.600
Because what you can do here
is you can separate metal.

00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.150
Because I started here with 40%
nickel, 60% copper, and

00:27:00.150 --> 00:27:02.360
now I've got something--

00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.880
the liquid face, I wrote
here, the liquid

00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:10.090
phase is now 68% copper.

00:27:10.090 --> 00:27:12.940
So can you see that if I'm
clever about this, I could use

00:27:12.940 --> 00:27:16.730
this as a technique
for enriching.

00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.790
And if I'm thinking about
recycling metals, maybe I need

00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:22.760
to know something about phase
diagrams because it's a very

00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:26.320
simple way of concentrating
impurities or concentrating

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.390
the desirable stuff.

00:27:28.390 --> 00:27:31.410
Let's look at one other thing
here that's really very

00:27:31.410 --> 00:27:32.550
interesting.

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:37.250
Suppose I had something, instead
of c2 at 40%, suppose

00:27:37.250 --> 00:27:38.800
I choose a c1.

00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:41.360
So this is 40% nickel.

00:27:41.360 --> 00:27:46.220
Now what if I take something
that's 35% nickel, and I cool

00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:48.390
it down to 1250?

00:27:48.390 --> 00:27:49.570
What happens?

00:27:49.570 --> 00:27:52.460
If I park here at 1250 degrees,
according to the

00:27:52.460 --> 00:27:57.280
phase diagram, that substance
has to phase separate, and I'm

00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:59.000
going to end up with
the same thing.

00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.310
I'm going to end up with
liquid and solid.

00:28:01.310 --> 00:28:03.380
Now, isn't there a contradiction
there?

00:28:03.380 --> 00:28:07.420
How is it that whether I started
with 40% or 35%, I end

00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:09.450
up with the same end members?

00:28:09.450 --> 00:28:11.630
What's the missing piece?

00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:14.250
The relative amounts
will be different!

00:28:14.250 --> 00:28:15.360
The relative amounts.

00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:16.470
Here, look.

00:28:16.470 --> 00:28:18.960
As I'm getting closer to the
liquid, can you see that

00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:21.540
axiomatically, I'm going to
make more liquid and less

00:28:21.540 --> 00:28:24.320
solid if I ended up with
something over here?

00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:26.610
But at 1250, those are
the end members.

00:28:26.610 --> 00:28:29.060
That's the only stuff that's
going to be present.

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.970
Ah!

00:28:29.970 --> 00:28:30.610
That's so good.

00:28:30.610 --> 00:28:33.020
I think I've got some
other stuff here.

00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:33.320
Oh yeah.

00:28:33.320 --> 00:28:34.140
Oh, this was-- yeah.

00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:36.010
So p equals 2.

00:28:36.010 --> 00:28:37.110
Lever rule.

00:28:37.110 --> 00:28:42.340
Whenever you see p equals 2, you
have two things you think

00:28:42.340 --> 00:28:44.390
of. p equals 2 means
phase separation.

00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.530
And that phase separation means
you're going to get

00:28:50.530 --> 00:28:52.410
different amounts, and
the lever rule.

00:28:52.410 --> 00:28:54.950
And why I have this Manchurian
Candidate--

00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:55.760
it's this movie.

00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:56.610
I know there's a remake.

00:28:56.610 --> 00:28:58.450
The remake is horrible.

00:28:58.450 --> 00:29:01.360
The original, if you see the
original, is about some

00:29:01.360 --> 00:29:02.185
fellows that were brainwashed.

00:29:02.185 --> 00:29:04.890
They were American prisoners
of war brainwashed in North

00:29:04.890 --> 00:29:08.210
Korea and they're brainwashed
to become assassins on cue.

00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:10.760
And the cue is the Queen
of Diamonds.

00:29:10.760 --> 00:29:13.110
When someone shows the Queen of
Diamonds, they just go into

00:29:13.110 --> 00:29:15.780
automatic pilot, and they're
supposed to assassinate the

00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.910
political figure.

00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:21.020
So for you, your Queen of
Diamonds is p equals 2.

00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.230
When you see p equals 2, you
go, phase separation.

00:29:24.230 --> 00:29:25.285
Lever rule.

00:29:25.285 --> 00:29:26.060
All right?

00:29:26.060 --> 00:29:27.500
No guns, just this.

00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.160
I just want the formula.

00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:32.360
You go, phase separation,
lever rule.

00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:36.370
Whenever p equals two.

00:29:36.370 --> 00:29:38.740
So what happens in here?

00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:39.800
Phase separation.

00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:40.390
Boom, boom.

00:29:40.390 --> 00:29:40.930
Right there.

00:29:40.930 --> 00:29:42.350
Oh, I'm not supposed
to say boom, boom.

00:29:42.350 --> 00:29:43.810
Phase separation.

00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:44.430
Ta-da!

00:29:44.430 --> 00:29:45.420
You know, something.

00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:47.080
PC, whatever.

00:29:47.080 --> 00:29:47.390
OK.

00:29:47.390 --> 00:29:48.960
So let's keep going.

00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.320
Now I want to look at a second
type of phase diagram.

00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:54.630
So the first type of phase
diagram was complete

00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:55.870
solubility.

00:29:55.870 --> 00:29:58.730
Now the second type of phase
diagram has partial

00:29:58.730 --> 00:29:59.390
solubility.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.870
So let's look at that one.

00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:03.280
So i call this type two.

00:30:05.830 --> 00:30:06.970
And you don't predict
this stuff.

00:30:06.970 --> 00:30:10.270
We would give you the phase
diagram and simply ask you,

00:30:10.270 --> 00:30:13.860
you know, you're the specialist.
Tell me happens if

00:30:13.860 --> 00:30:16.250
I cool this to such and
such a temperature?

00:30:16.250 --> 00:30:18.390
You can tell me you get phase
separation, and the

00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:20.470
composition of the two end
members, and so on.

00:30:20.470 --> 00:30:23.110
So the characteristics, the
bonding characteristics here,

00:30:23.110 --> 00:30:35.880
are partial or limited
solubility of A and B.

00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.700
We're doing all of this for a
binary system A and B, and no

00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.950
change of state.

00:30:44.830 --> 00:30:52.920
So that means either always
solid, or always liquid.

00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.800
That's not to say that the A
and B never become solid.

00:30:55.800 --> 00:30:58.960
I'm just saying that a type two
diagram is limited to a

00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.160
single state.

00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.590
So let's take a look
at the diagram.

00:31:05.590 --> 00:31:07.380
The diagram looks like this.

00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:10.100
We're going to plot
temperature versus

00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:10.860
composition.

00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:14.150
So pure B on the right,
pure A on the left.

00:31:14.150 --> 00:31:18.810
Concentration is the abscissa,
and then the ordinate, of

00:31:18.810 --> 00:31:20.890
course, is temperature.

00:31:20.890 --> 00:31:24.690
And so the shape of the
diagram is this.

00:31:24.690 --> 00:31:27.360
There's the coexistence curve.

00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:32.895
It's called a synclinal
coexistence curve.

00:31:38.510 --> 00:31:44.740
So above, we have all solid.

00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:47.430
And in here, we have
two solids.

00:31:47.430 --> 00:31:49.990
So using the metallurgical
terms, this

00:31:49.990 --> 00:31:51.600
is alpha plus beta.

00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.570
Two phase regime, OK?

00:31:53.570 --> 00:31:56.910
So let's get those labels up
right off the bat, so we know

00:31:56.910 --> 00:31:57.560
who's where.

00:31:57.560 --> 00:32:02.620
So outside the coexistence
curve, p equals 1.

00:32:02.620 --> 00:32:05.830
Inside the coexistence
curve, p equals 2.

00:32:05.830 --> 00:32:08.440
And wherever I'm saying all
solid, alpha plus beta, I

00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.700
could write all liquid, and then
it goes to l1 plus l2.

00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:15.780
So maybe we should do that, to
show that we're multilingual.

00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:22.680
So it's either all solid, or
it could be all liquid.

00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:25.080
And then this would be liquid
1 plus liquid 2.

00:32:28.070 --> 00:32:31.400
And so why do we call
it synclinal?

00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.570
What's this?

00:32:32.570 --> 00:32:34.320
This is an incline.

00:32:34.320 --> 00:32:35.970
If I put two inclines
and I synchronize

00:32:35.970 --> 00:32:37.780
them, I get a syncline.

00:32:37.780 --> 00:32:39.300
And if I don't synchronize
them--

00:32:39.300 --> 00:32:40.060
these are two ladders.

00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:40.910
I could prop them up.

00:32:40.910 --> 00:32:42.900
That's called a syncline.

00:32:42.900 --> 00:32:45.745
And if I put two ladders like
this, if I'm really stupid and

00:32:45.745 --> 00:32:48.410
I fail physics, if I do
this, they fall down.

00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:51.220
So this is called an
anticline, OK?

00:32:51.220 --> 00:32:52.100
That's an anticline.

00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:53.350
This is a syncline.

00:32:57.380 --> 00:33:01.700
It's not a U-shape, or a hump,
or something like that.

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:02.620
This is 3091.

00:33:02.620 --> 00:33:03.740
This is a syncline.

00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:05.230
Synclinal coexistence curve.

00:33:05.230 --> 00:33:05.520
All right.

00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:06.620
So what's on here?

00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:08.960
What's this equilibrium, then?

00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:11.630
Well, the equilibrium must
be this equals this.

00:33:11.630 --> 00:33:14.560
So that would be, in the case
of the solid, it's the solid

00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:19.100
solution goes to alpha plus
beta, or it could be the

00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:23.570
liquid goes to liquid
1 plus liquid 2.

00:33:23.570 --> 00:33:26.110
That's the equilibrium.

00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:28.550
You can think about it almost
as a solubility.

00:33:28.550 --> 00:33:30.140
So let's start over
here on the left.

00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.190
Let's pick a temperature.

00:33:31.190 --> 00:33:32.670
Let's call this T1.

00:33:32.670 --> 00:33:37.270
So I can put B into A, and I
continue to get an all-solid

00:33:37.270 --> 00:33:40.060
solution, up to this
concentration here.

00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:42.230
What happens at this
concentration?

00:33:42.230 --> 00:33:44.050
I've hit a solubility limit.

00:33:44.050 --> 00:33:47.545
And if I try to put any more B
into A, I get a tie line--

00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:51.290
lever rule.

00:33:51.290 --> 00:33:54.210
In here is lever rule
time, isn't it?

00:33:54.210 --> 00:33:56.780
Lever rule. p equals 2, OK?

00:33:56.780 --> 00:33:59.010
So it's solubility limits.

00:33:59.010 --> 00:34:00.260
Solubility limits.

00:34:02.550 --> 00:34:02.850
All right.

00:34:02.850 --> 00:34:06.820
So let's look at
some examples.

00:34:06.820 --> 00:34:07.760
Oh, here's this one, actually.

00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:08.720
That's why I had a--

00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.995
you know, if you go to lower
temperature, gold, nickel--

00:34:10.995 --> 00:34:12.520
look!

00:34:12.520 --> 00:34:14.250
They actually phase separate.

00:34:14.250 --> 00:34:15.060
That's shocking.

00:34:15.060 --> 00:34:18.120
I always find this one shocking,
because you think

00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.610
gold, nickel, nice FCC
metals, they should

00:34:20.610 --> 00:34:21.850
substitute for one another.

00:34:21.850 --> 00:34:22.435
Look what happens.

00:34:22.435 --> 00:34:25.760
If you start putting nickel into
pure gold at 700 degrees,

00:34:25.760 --> 00:34:28.440
you get the 10 weight percent,
you put any more in, boom.

00:34:28.440 --> 00:34:30.870
Right across here.

00:34:30.870 --> 00:34:32.840
So this is going to
be two phase.

00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.870
So if you look at the
solid, what's that

00:34:35.870 --> 00:34:37.650
going to look like?

00:34:37.650 --> 00:34:41.400
If I'm at, say, 30%, now I look
underneath and I've got a

00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.030
polygrain system, and I'm going
to have an alpha and a

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:47.160
beta, and an alpha and a beta.

00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:49.850
I'm going to have two
different grains.

00:34:49.850 --> 00:34:52.000
And now, what's the relative
amount of alpha and the

00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:53.340
relative amount of beta?

00:34:53.340 --> 00:34:55.860
It's given by the lever rule.

00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:56.970
OK.

00:34:56.970 --> 00:34:58.340
Let's look at a few
other examples.

00:34:58.340 --> 00:35:01.130
Here's hexane nitrobenzene.

00:35:01.130 --> 00:35:04.190
And so they've even put
l-alpha, l-beta.

00:35:04.190 --> 00:35:05.270
They put the--

00:35:05.270 --> 00:35:06.630
actually, that's probably a--

00:35:06.630 --> 00:35:07.350
it's hard to read.

00:35:07.350 --> 00:35:09.980
But I think it's really an F,
but it didn't come through

00:35:09.980 --> 00:35:13.040
very well, so it's the beta
fraction, the alpha fraction.

00:35:13.040 --> 00:35:14.930
So you can see how you
use the lever rule.

00:35:14.930 --> 00:35:16.430
So up here it's all p.

00:35:16.430 --> 00:35:19.000
That's the not pressure,
that's my circle p.

00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.550
Single phase, two phase.

00:35:20.550 --> 00:35:23.820
Drop down to 290 degrees, it
separates into two liquids.

00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:24.930
With the hexane--

00:35:24.930 --> 00:35:26.730
with two liquids, you'll
actually have them floating on

00:35:26.730 --> 00:35:28.600
top of one another, right?

00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:29.310
Well, maybe.

00:35:29.310 --> 00:35:31.840
Depending if the density
difference is tiny, you might

00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.710
get a dispersion.

00:35:32.710 --> 00:35:34.390
I'll show you that
in a second.

00:35:34.390 --> 00:35:34.670
All right.

00:35:34.670 --> 00:35:36.680
So p equals 2, lever rule.

00:35:36.680 --> 00:35:38.740
OK?

00:35:38.740 --> 00:35:40.320
Hexane nitrobenzene.

00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:40.940
Look at this one.

00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.010
This is surprising to me.

00:35:42.010 --> 00:35:44.020
Potassium chloride,
sodium chloride.

00:35:44.020 --> 00:35:46.420
It's almost lenticular with a
little bit of depression, but

00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:47.670
down here, it actually
separates.

00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:51.930
This is polymer.

00:35:51.930 --> 00:35:53.840
It's a polystyrene,
polybutadiene,

00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:56.460
depending on what the--

00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:01.150
at low index, polymerization
index, they mix.

00:36:01.150 --> 00:36:03.360
At high polymerization index,
the two are mixing.

00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:05.020
You get two phase,
single phase.

00:36:05.020 --> 00:36:09.040
Changes the mechanical
properties, too, doesn't it?

00:36:09.040 --> 00:36:10.220
Now this one--

00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:13.720
some systems actually have
a lower critical point.

00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:14.800
Oh, I meant to tell you.

00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:17.570
You see, there's this
temperature here.

00:36:17.570 --> 00:36:20.290
Above this temperature, they
mix in all proportions.

00:36:20.290 --> 00:36:22.400
You can ever have phase
separation.

00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:25.560
This is the maximum temperature
at which you have

00:36:25.560 --> 00:36:26.980
no phase separation.

00:36:26.980 --> 00:36:32.030
So this is called the consolute
temperature.

00:36:32.030 --> 00:36:35.070
And it's usually an
upper consolute.

00:36:35.070 --> 00:36:36.570
The higher you go
in temperature--

00:36:36.570 --> 00:36:39.320
it's like saying, do you
dissolve more sugar in cold

00:36:39.320 --> 00:36:41.010
water or warm water?

00:36:41.010 --> 00:36:43.270
You dissolve more sugar
in warm water.

00:36:43.270 --> 00:36:45.200
And eventually, you get to a
temperature high enough that

00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:47.270
you can mix in all proportions,
right?

00:36:47.270 --> 00:36:48.540
That's the consolute.

00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.970
Some systems, for entropic
reasons-- and again, if you

00:36:50.970 --> 00:36:53.870
take 560 or some of the other
thermal classes, you'll

00:36:53.870 --> 00:36:57.010
understand this, but for
entropic reasons, you actually

00:36:57.010 --> 00:37:00.710
have homogeneous solutions at
low temperature, and at

00:37:00.710 --> 00:37:02.640
elevated temperature, you
get phase separation.

00:37:02.640 --> 00:37:03.840
That's funny, isn't it.

00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.860
So this is water triethylamine,
and they mix in

00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:09.810
all proportions at
this zone here.

00:37:09.810 --> 00:37:12.460
And then above a certain-- it's
called lower consolute

00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:13.290
temperature.

00:37:13.290 --> 00:37:15.060
It actually phase separates.

00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:15.700
Doesn't matter.

00:37:15.700 --> 00:37:20.120
All you care about is
p equals 2, phase

00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:22.410
separation, lever rule.

00:37:22.410 --> 00:37:24.110
The rest is details.

00:37:24.110 --> 00:37:25.700
This is a real hoot.

00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:27.320
This is water nicotine.

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.460
It has a lower consolute
temperature and an upper

00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.180
consolute temperature.

00:37:32.180 --> 00:37:34.015
So it's got a solubility
bubble.

00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:37.760
You see?

00:37:37.760 --> 00:37:39.350
Out here, things are soluble.

00:37:39.350 --> 00:37:41.190
In here, they're insoluble.

00:37:41.190 --> 00:37:42.490
So they are emissible.

00:37:42.490 --> 00:37:46.270
So we call this zone, this
region here under the dome, so

00:37:46.270 --> 00:37:55.160
to speak, this it's called the
miscibility gap, because

00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:57.620
things in there are not soluble
in one another.

00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.890
But with nicotine, you have a
lower consolute and an upper

00:37:59.890 --> 00:38:01.740
consolute, so you have a
miscibility gap that's a

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:04.470
complete ring.

00:38:04.470 --> 00:38:05.615
That's cool!

00:38:05.615 --> 00:38:07.780
I like this.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:08.000
All right.

00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:09.240
So now I'm going to do
a little experiment.

00:38:09.240 --> 00:38:10.990
We have a few minutes, so I'm
going to show you ouzo water.

00:38:10.990 --> 00:38:14.830
I'm going to mix it, and I'm
going to actually mix ouzo and

00:38:14.830 --> 00:38:18.420
water, and go into the two phase
regime, and then out.

00:38:18.420 --> 00:38:20.050
So this is what it
is, all right?

00:38:20.050 --> 00:38:21.510
It's oily stuff, you know.

00:38:21.510 --> 00:38:23.920
If you're of Greek ancestry, you
know what this stuff is.

00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:24.290
All right?

00:38:24.290 --> 00:38:26.810
But it's got licorice, it's got
a fair bit of oil in it.

00:38:26.810 --> 00:38:29.010
So what I'm going to do, is I'm
going to come in here, and

00:38:29.010 --> 00:38:31.650
I'm going to start adding
ouzo to water.

00:38:31.650 --> 00:38:34.400
And they're both clear,
colorless liquids.

00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:35.765
OK, Dave. Let's go to the--

00:38:39.854 --> 00:38:40.590
All right.

00:38:40.590 --> 00:38:44.520
So what we're going to do--
this is distilled water.

00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:46.490
So I'm going to put some
distilled water in here.

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.980
A little bit of distilled
water.

00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:49.020
And this is ouzo.

00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:50.770
It's clear and colorless.

00:38:50.770 --> 00:38:51.020
OK.

00:38:51.020 --> 00:38:53.142
Can we show you this?

00:38:53.142 --> 00:38:54.470
Let's do this.

00:38:54.470 --> 00:38:54.770
OK.

00:38:54.770 --> 00:38:58.060
Ouzo, it comes from Greece.

00:38:58.060 --> 00:38:59.030
All right.

00:38:59.030 --> 00:39:01.780
So it's also clear
and colorless.

00:39:01.780 --> 00:39:02.660
That was the point.

00:39:02.660 --> 00:39:03.840
Not to show you the label.

00:39:03.840 --> 00:39:04.100
See?

00:39:04.100 --> 00:39:05.590
It's clear and colorless.

00:39:05.590 --> 00:39:07.800
So this is clear and colorless,
and the water, as

00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:09.340
you know, is clear
and colorless.

00:39:09.340 --> 00:39:10.560
So now what I'm going to do--

00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.995
see, I don't have
to wear a smock,

00:39:11.995 --> 00:39:13.430
or goggles, or anything.

00:39:13.430 --> 00:39:14.590
This is great.

00:39:14.590 --> 00:39:15.760
So what I'm going to do,
is I'm going to add

00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:16.570
some of this stuff.

00:39:16.570 --> 00:39:17.820
Clear and colorless.

00:39:21.690 --> 00:39:22.040
OK.

00:39:22.040 --> 00:39:22.910
It's turned milky.

00:39:22.910 --> 00:39:24.300
Why has it turned milky?

00:39:24.300 --> 00:39:29.070
Because we've now crossed into
here, and the second phase is

00:39:29.070 --> 00:39:29.890
coming out.

00:39:29.890 --> 00:39:32.830
But the density difference and
surface tension differences

00:39:32.830 --> 00:39:37.470
are so slight, that instead of
having the second phase float

00:39:37.470 --> 00:39:41.190
on the first phase, we
have a dispersion, G.

00:39:41.190 --> 00:39:43.340
If you go to the dairy case,
and you look at something

00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:46.160
called milk, you'll have
the same thing.

00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.360
Why is milk milky?

00:39:47.360 --> 00:39:50.640
Because the fatty phase is a
fine dispersion, and the

00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:54.480
particle sizes is dadadada,
versus the wavelength of

00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:55.940
visible light, et cetera.

00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.070
Now if my phase diagram is
correct, and I'm in here, if I

00:40:00.070 --> 00:40:03.310
keep adding ouzo, I should
eventually emerge on this

00:40:03.310 --> 00:40:10.190
side, and instead of having a
milky dispersion, I eventually

00:40:10.190 --> 00:40:13.240
should come here, and now
I'll have a homogeneous,

00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.830
single-phase solution.

00:40:14.830 --> 00:40:17.300
But now it's going to be
ouzo-rich, instead of

00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.550
water-rich.

00:40:20.310 --> 00:40:23.330
You never thought phase diagrams
were interesting.

00:40:23.330 --> 00:40:24.580
You don't know.

00:40:29.660 --> 00:40:32.870
There we go.

00:40:32.870 --> 00:40:35.000
Je vous presente.

00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.350
There it is.

00:40:36.350 --> 00:40:39.430
So what we've done is, we've
come across the thing.

00:40:39.430 --> 00:40:41.840
Yeah, that's good.

00:40:41.840 --> 00:40:43.300
Just put that there.

00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:48.670
Now, David, please, back
to the slides.

00:40:48.670 --> 00:40:51.000
May I have the next
slide, please?

00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.670
That's a joke.

00:40:52.670 --> 00:40:57.100
When you have these terrible
speakers at conferences, they

00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.570
get up there, really nervous,
and they stand up there, and

00:40:59.570 --> 00:41:01.180
the first thing they say
is, may I have the

00:41:01.180 --> 00:41:02.730
first slide, please?

00:41:02.730 --> 00:41:04.970
That's sort of a gag
among scientists.

00:41:04.970 --> 00:41:07.260
What's your opening statement?

00:41:07.260 --> 00:41:10.150
May I have the first
slide, please?

00:41:10.150 --> 00:41:11.590
May I have the next
slide, please?

00:41:11.590 --> 00:41:11.780
OK.

00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.240
So we've done this.

00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.940
All right.

00:41:14.940 --> 00:41:15.810
Now--

00:41:15.810 --> 00:41:18.890
yeah, OK, this is just more.

00:41:18.890 --> 00:41:19.014
All right.

00:41:19.014 --> 00:41:20.390
So now I'm going to
show you absinthe.

00:41:20.390 --> 00:41:21.460
Absinthe is the same thing.

00:41:21.460 --> 00:41:24.970
Absinthe also comes from
the same family.

00:41:24.970 --> 00:41:28.020
And there's a little
culture here.

00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:29.280
It contains wormwood.

00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.750
The wormwood was up at around
200, 250 parts per million.

00:41:32.750 --> 00:41:36.060
And what wormwood
does, it's got a

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.150
hormone they call thujone.

00:41:37.150 --> 00:41:40.900
And thujone antagonizes the
gamma aminobutyric acid, which

00:41:40.900 --> 00:41:43.080
moderates firing of the
neural synapses.

00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.440
Basically, we've got this GABA
that regulates how-- our

00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.250
brains could work much
faster than they do,

00:41:49.250 --> 00:41:51.880
but the GABA regulates.

00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:55.470
If GABA doesn't work, you can
start moving so fast that you

00:41:55.470 --> 00:41:58.310
get muscle thing, and you get
epileptic, is one example.

00:41:58.310 --> 00:42:02.050
But anyways, what it does, is
if you drink this stuff,

00:42:02.050 --> 00:42:04.280
instead of being a stupid
drunk, you become a very

00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:08.410
high-functioning, very
alert drunk.

00:42:08.410 --> 00:42:10.470
And I'm going to show you what
the consequence is in art.

00:42:10.470 --> 00:42:14.640
Anyways, the cultural piece
here was that there was a

00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:19.430
destruction of the French wine
industry in the 1800s due to a

00:42:19.430 --> 00:42:22.130
blight called Phylloxera.

00:42:22.130 --> 00:42:24.780
It's like a beetle, and
it ate the vines.

00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:26.950
And in fact, the French wine
industry was saved by the

00:42:26.950 --> 00:42:28.150
American wine industry.

00:42:28.150 --> 00:42:31.755
Vines from New York state were
brought over, grafts were

00:42:31.755 --> 00:42:36.160
made, and virtually all French
wine today is on American

00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:39.370
stock with the exception,
occasionally you'll see

00:42:39.370 --> 00:42:40.650
something says vieille vin.

00:42:40.650 --> 00:42:41.460
Old vines.

00:42:41.460 --> 00:42:43.520
There was some areas
that were spared.

00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:45.620
So what's that have to
do with anything?

00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:48.860
It has to do with the fact that
when the Phylloxera hit,

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:52.030
the price of wine went very
high, and the people at the

00:42:52.030 --> 00:42:55.230
bottom of the socioeconomic
ladder couldn't afford wine.

00:42:55.230 --> 00:42:57.010
So they turn to absinthe.

00:42:57.010 --> 00:42:59.610
Absinthe was easily produced.

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:02.600
Thirty years later, when the
vines come back, the French

00:43:02.600 --> 00:43:05.350
wine industry wants to
recapture the market.

00:43:05.350 --> 00:43:07.920
So there's a Faustian bargain
between the French wine

00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:12.160
industry and the Women's
Temperance Union to try to

00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:14.530
disparage absinthe.

00:43:14.530 --> 00:43:17.620
And there were a few major
show trials that involved

00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:20.750
vicious murders in which it was
alleged that the killer

00:43:20.750 --> 00:43:23.120
was deranged on absinthe.

00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.870
And with this, they slandered
the name of absinthe so badly

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:29.570
that it was eventually
banned and literally

00:43:29.570 --> 00:43:30.990
taken off the market.

00:43:30.990 --> 00:43:32.000
I mean--

00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:34.780
you know, we had the Rosalind
Franklin commentary a few

00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:35.240
lectures ago.

00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.610
I hope I never read about you
doing something like this in

00:43:37.610 --> 00:43:39.450
order to help your
start-up company

00:43:39.450 --> 00:43:40.580
take over market share.

00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:43.880
That's not the way you're
supposed to do it.

00:43:43.880 --> 00:43:44.650
Anyway, so what--

00:43:44.650 --> 00:43:46.030
now, how did they drink it?

00:43:46.030 --> 00:43:47.940
They drank it by mixing--

00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:50.050
so it's now back, but it's
got very low levels

00:43:50.050 --> 00:43:51.420
of thujone, so it's--

00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:53.240
David, may we go to this?

00:43:53.240 --> 00:43:55.200
So we're going to make a
mix called the louche.

00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.090
It's a--

00:43:56.090 --> 00:43:57.730
OK, here it is.

00:43:57.730 --> 00:43:59.005
And this stuff here
is beautiful.

00:44:01.550 --> 00:44:04.950
Because it's a green color,
a soft green color.

00:44:04.950 --> 00:44:06.710
And the French even have
a name for it.

00:44:06.710 --> 00:44:09.660
They call it the green
fairy, la fee verte.

00:44:09.660 --> 00:44:13.620
So this is what absinthe
looks like.

00:44:13.620 --> 00:44:14.520
Beautiful.

00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:15.280
Very nice.

00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:17.950
And it's got the same kind
of licorice smell to it.

00:44:17.950 --> 00:44:22.590
And so you make the louche by
one part absinthe and five

00:44:22.590 --> 00:44:23.210
parts water.

00:44:23.210 --> 00:44:27.030
So this, at no upcharge,
you get this glass.

00:44:27.030 --> 00:44:31.210
It's a beautiful piece
of, you know, late

00:44:31.210 --> 00:44:32.860
Belle Epoque glassware.

00:44:32.860 --> 00:44:34.980
And the interesting thing is,
these people were absolutely

00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:37.120
crazy, scientifically.

00:44:37.120 --> 00:44:40.180
And so what they did is, the
markings on this glass are

00:44:40.180 --> 00:44:44.210
such that if you put absinthe up
to this ring here, and then

00:44:44.210 --> 00:44:47.060
you put water the rest of the
way, you get exactly the five

00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:49.220
to one ratio for louche.

00:44:49.220 --> 00:44:51.320
So you don't even
have to measure.

00:44:51.320 --> 00:44:53.930
You just put like so.

00:44:53.930 --> 00:44:54.240
OK.

00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:55.060
Let's see.

00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:55.930
I'm going to get this right!

00:44:55.930 --> 00:44:57.180
It's science.

00:44:58.950 --> 00:45:01.610
Here's our distilled water.

00:45:01.610 --> 00:45:04.030
You see how it's milky?

00:45:04.030 --> 00:45:05.030
So there's the louche.

00:45:05.030 --> 00:45:11.390
And if you wanted to be a real
hipster, you had this special

00:45:11.390 --> 00:45:13.320
Belle Epoque spoon.

00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.500
And what you'd put on top of
this would be a sugar cube.

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.400
You know, this is
how it was done.

00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.960
You have to know some culture.

00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:21.500
You don't know.

00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.200
You've led sheltered lives.

00:45:23.200 --> 00:45:24.380
You pour it through
here, like this.

00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.570
So now I'm going to
show you the art.

00:45:26.570 --> 00:45:31.820
So David, may we cut to
the slides again?

00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:35.110
So there's the louche.

00:45:35.110 --> 00:45:35.390
All right.

00:45:35.390 --> 00:45:36.150
So here's the poster.

00:45:36.150 --> 00:45:36.710
Here's the man.

00:45:36.710 --> 00:45:40.820
He's pouring the water through
the slotted spoon with the

00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:43.240
thing, and there's a very
well-to-do lady, you can tell,

00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:45.470
she's got a beautiful hat,
and she's well-dressed.

00:45:45.470 --> 00:45:48.610
And he's inviting her to join
him for a glass of absinthe.

00:45:48.610 --> 00:45:50.200
L'absinthe oxygenee.

00:45:50.200 --> 00:45:51.230
That's the name of
the company.

00:45:51.230 --> 00:45:52.940
The oxygenated absinthe.

00:45:52.940 --> 00:45:53.800
C'est ma sante.

00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:55.050
This is my health.

00:45:58.120 --> 00:46:01.490
Van Gogh painted this.

00:46:01.490 --> 00:46:02.320
This is Picasso.

00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:03.250
The absinthe drinker.

00:46:03.250 --> 00:46:05.050
There's the absinthe again.

00:46:05.050 --> 00:46:09.040
This is Picasso after
many absinthes.

00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:12.090
You can see the slotted spoon
and the sugar cube.

00:46:12.090 --> 00:46:13.550
What else is there?

00:46:13.550 --> 00:46:16.750
That's up to you.

00:46:16.750 --> 00:46:17.050
All right.

00:46:17.050 --> 00:46:19.740
When you saw Moulin Rouge, you
may not have known all of this

00:46:19.740 --> 00:46:20.580
cultural history.

00:46:20.580 --> 00:46:24.040
So now let's take a look at
what's going on here.

00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:26.890
There's the absinthe, and I
think we've got a little--

00:46:26.890 --> 00:46:28.838
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:28.838 --> 00:46:32.247
-I don't even know if I am a
true Bohemian revolutionary.

00:46:32.247 --> 00:46:33.840
-Do you believe in beauty?

00:46:33.840 --> 00:46:34.665
-Yes.

00:46:34.665 --> 00:46:35.130
-Freedom?

00:46:35.130 --> 00:46:35.786
-Yes, of course.

00:46:35.786 --> 00:46:36.780
-Truth?

00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:36.960
-Yes.

00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:39.170
-Love?

00:46:39.170 --> 00:46:39.970
-Love?

00:46:39.970 --> 00:46:41.086
Love.

00:46:41.086 --> 00:46:43.245
Above all things, I
believe in love.

00:46:43.245 --> 00:46:45.320
Love is like oxygen.

00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:46.570
Love is a many-splendored
thing--

00:46:51.866 --> 00:46:52.580
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:46:52.580 --> 00:46:55.020
Love is like oxygen.

00:46:55.020 --> 00:46:56.270
Chemistry is everywhere!

00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.110
All right, so this is what
happens eventually.

00:47:02.110 --> 00:47:03.720
This is the poster.

00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:04.950
This is from Switzerland.

00:47:04.950 --> 00:47:06.560
October 7, 1910.

00:47:06.560 --> 00:47:08.350
Gentleman, This Is the Hour!

00:47:08.350 --> 00:47:11.020
And there's the clergyman with
the Bible, and there's the

00:47:11.020 --> 00:47:11.900
green fairy.

00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.030
And she has a wand.

00:47:14.030 --> 00:47:16.640
She's been stabbed, but she's
lying here with a wand.

00:47:16.640 --> 00:47:19.440
The wand is an opalescent wand,
because this stuff is

00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:20.220
opalescent.

00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:22.390
Last thing I'll show you is
some really, really cool

00:47:22.390 --> 00:47:24.720
chemistry that you
must remember.

00:47:24.720 --> 00:47:26.360
When Toulouse-Lautrec drank--

00:47:26.360 --> 00:47:30.160
let's go back, David,
to the thing.

00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:33.320
So when Toulouse-Lautrec drank
absinthe, and he drank lots of

00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.370
it, he didn't like
the milky color.

00:47:36.370 --> 00:47:38.910
So he wanted to make the
milky color disappear.

00:47:38.910 --> 00:47:41.330
So I'm in the two-phase
regime, and

00:47:41.330 --> 00:47:42.760
I've got an oily phase.

00:47:42.760 --> 00:47:44.910
And so how do I get rid
of the oily phase?

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.800
What he did is he added cognac

00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:48.200
And why did he add cognac?

00:47:48.200 --> 00:47:52.550
Not because he was a
hard-drinking alcoholic.

00:47:52.550 --> 00:47:56.355
It's because if you've got a fat
phase here, and you've got

00:47:56.355 --> 00:47:58.500
an aqueous phase here,
and if you add

00:47:58.500 --> 00:48:00.030
alcohol, you've got CH3CH2OH.

00:48:04.130 --> 00:48:09.680
This can bond to the water by
a hydrogen bond, and this

00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:12.330
aliphatic tail can
stab the fat and

00:48:12.330 --> 00:48:13.460
bring them into solution.

00:48:13.460 --> 00:48:15.010
That's why you have
these recipes.

00:48:15.010 --> 00:48:17.810
Do you ever wonder why the
recipe says, add brandy, or

00:48:17.810 --> 00:48:20.350
add this, and then two steps
later, it says flame?

00:48:20.350 --> 00:48:22.010
You say, geez, I just put
the brandy in, now

00:48:22.010 --> 00:48:23.380
it's vaporizing away.

00:48:23.380 --> 00:48:24.370
Isn't that kind of stupid?

00:48:24.370 --> 00:48:25.630
No, it's not!

00:48:25.630 --> 00:48:26.410
This is what you're doing.

00:48:26.410 --> 00:48:27.360
You're cosolvating.

00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:29.650
If you're ever making a cream
sauce or something, and all of

00:48:29.650 --> 00:48:31.570
a sudden, everything
just curdles?

00:48:31.570 --> 00:48:32.350
First you scream.

00:48:32.350 --> 00:48:33.010
You go, ahhh!

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.290
Phase separation.

00:48:34.290 --> 00:48:36.910
The second thing you do, is you
get some of this, and you

00:48:36.910 --> 00:48:37.960
cosolvate it.

00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:38.940
All right.

00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:40.440
So let's see what Lautrec did.

00:48:40.440 --> 00:48:42.286
Lautrec--

00:48:42.286 --> 00:48:44.550
I might have to dilute
the volume here.

00:48:44.550 --> 00:48:45.600
We've got quite a lot in here.

00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:47.230
So just to make the point.

00:48:47.230 --> 00:48:49.520
So here's the louche, ad now
we're going to add cognac.

00:48:49.520 --> 00:48:51.720
He called this drink, Le
Tremblement de Terre.

00:48:51.720 --> 00:48:54.370
The earthquake.

00:48:54.370 --> 00:48:57.680
He had a walking stick a meter
long that was hollow, and it

00:48:57.680 --> 00:48:58.470
always had this in it.

00:48:58.470 --> 00:49:00.120
Look!

00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:01.010
Look at that.

00:49:01.010 --> 00:49:02.120
Isn't that something?

00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:07.290
So now it's this beautiful
blonde, golden color.

00:49:07.290 --> 00:49:09.230
It's clear.

00:49:09.230 --> 00:49:14.270
So this is all phase separation
and so on.

00:49:14.270 --> 00:49:15.910
At the end, it's all
about chemistry.

00:49:15.910 --> 00:49:16.210
All right.

00:49:16.210 --> 00:49:18.830
We'll see you on Wednesday
for our wrap-up.

00:49:18.830 --> 00:49:20.080
Good.
