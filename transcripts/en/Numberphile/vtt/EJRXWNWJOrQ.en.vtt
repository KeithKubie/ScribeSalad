MATT PARKER: OK, so it's
a Numberphile video.

00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:03.610
We should do something
with numbers.

00:00:03.610 --> 00:00:06.900
I've got a blackboard here, so
we'll just bring this up.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:14.210
The first thing I'd like to do
is show you a very nice, very

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.590
quick, wonderful number trick.

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:16.280
Ah, excellent.

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:17.420
Some brown paper.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:21.340
OK, so for this number trick,
what you do is you take any

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:22.700
one-digit number.

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:26.990
So for example, Brady, what
one digit would you like?

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.000
BRADY HARAN: 6.

00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:28.140
MATT PARKER: 6.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:28.990
Lovely number, 6.

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:31.590
So you write down the number
6, that's the digit you

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:34.880
picked, and then you write it
down two more times to get a

00:00:34.880 --> 00:00:35.650
three-digit number.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:38.400
So in this case, 666.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.700
And then what you do is first of
all, you work out what the

00:00:41.700 --> 00:00:43.340
sum of those three digits are.

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.930
So in this case, 6 plus
6 is 12, plus 6 is 18.

00:00:46.930 --> 00:00:50.160
So were I to add them, I would
get 18 as a total.

00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:54.200
And then I'm going to divide
666 by that total.

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.100
By 18.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.330
And that equals, so if I put in
666, and then divide that

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:04.125
by 18, it equals 37.

00:01:04.125 --> 00:01:06.620
OK, so you happened to pick 6.

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:11.630
Three 6's divided by the sum of
the 6's equals there's 37.

00:01:11.630 --> 00:01:14.950
And the reason this counts as
a number trick is before we

00:01:14.950 --> 00:01:18.730
started, I predicted that
the total would be 37.

00:01:18.730 --> 00:01:23.430
In fact, this is the video,
unsurprisingly, about 37.

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.340
And that will work for any
number you care to choose.

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:30.130
In fact, I will show
you why that works.

00:01:30.130 --> 00:01:31.230
So let's get this out there.

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:33.120
This is getting a bit silly
writing on paper.

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:34.820
We'll get that out of the way.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:35.590
Ah, marvelous.

00:01:35.590 --> 00:01:39.230
OK, so I'll show you
why that works.

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:41.040
Bring this up.

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.760
So when you pick any number.

00:01:42.760 --> 00:01:46.980
So you pick 6, or let's do 7
instead, let's say, right?

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:52.150
When you write something like
777, what you're actually

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:59.170
doing is that is exactly the
same as 7 times 111.

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:02.130
Or so whatever your one digit
number happens to be, it's

00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.400
that times 111.

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:07.670
And when you add the three
digits together, what you're

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.669
doing there is you're just doing
whatever your digit was

00:02:10.669 --> 00:02:13.370
times 3, because there's
going to 3 of them.

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:16.450
So in fact, that bit there where
I divided, in your case,

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:23.080
666 divided by 18, or here I'll
divide 777 by 21, what

00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:29.500
I've actually got is 7 times
111 over 7 times 3.

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:33.020
And these cancel out, and you're
left with 111 divided

00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:36.100
by 3, which is 37.

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.680
So every single time you do it,
it's whatever the number

00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:41.950
is times 111 divided
by whatever the

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:44.650
number is times 3.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:45.660
These cancel out.

00:02:45.660 --> 00:02:50.110
It's always 111 divided
by 3, which equals 37.
