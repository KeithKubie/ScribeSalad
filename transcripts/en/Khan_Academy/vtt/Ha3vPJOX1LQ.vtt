00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:03.167
- Hi I'm Sal Khan, founder
of the Khan Academy,

00:00:03.167 --> 00:00:04.653
and I just wanted to let you know about

00:00:04.653 --> 00:00:06.580
our India Talent Search.

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:09.134
As you might know Khan
Academy we're a not for profit

00:00:09.134 --> 00:00:11.317
with a mission of providing
a free world-class education

00:00:11.317 --> 00:00:13.360
for anyone anywhere.

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.425
And to us it means that if
you are a villager someplace

00:00:16.425 --> 00:00:18.399
and you don't have access
to a formal school,

00:00:18.399 --> 00:00:20.605
that you might be able to
access a low cost smartphone

00:00:20.605 --> 00:00:22.881
and then be able to self-educate yourself

00:00:22.881 --> 00:00:24.692
and one day prove what
you know so that you could

00:00:24.692 --> 00:00:26.549
get a job or go and get
into higher education.

00:00:26.549 --> 00:00:28.570
But ideally you're using Khan Academy

00:00:28.570 --> 00:00:30.195
in conjunction with a classroom.

00:00:30.195 --> 00:00:32.424
Where the classroom can
allow students to learn

00:00:32.424 --> 00:00:35.048
and work at their own pace,
give data to teachers,

00:00:35.048 --> 00:00:38.183
free up class time for open-ended projects

00:00:38.183 --> 00:00:41.155
or peer-to-peer learning
or Socratic dialogue.

00:00:41.155 --> 00:00:43.825
And so we have a call out for the talent,

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:45.659
the teaching talent in India,

00:00:45.659 --> 00:00:47.796
to work with us.

00:00:47.796 --> 00:00:49.746
By being part of this talent search,

00:00:49.746 --> 00:00:53.067
one, you'll get a chance to
practice making videos yourself.

00:00:53.067 --> 00:00:56.457
And we're looking for folks
in math and science initially,

00:00:56.457 --> 00:00:58.384
but eventually all subjects.

00:00:58.384 --> 00:01:00.776
But it's a way for us to find talent,

00:01:00.776 --> 00:01:03.864
talent that can help us create content

00:01:03.864 --> 00:01:07.138
that will educate tens
of millions of learners

00:01:07.138 --> 00:01:08.903
throughout India.

00:01:08.903 --> 00:01:12.084
So the opportunity here is
I think pretty exciting.

00:01:12.084 --> 00:01:15.195
There will be prizes, but
maybe the biggest prize of all

00:01:15.195 --> 00:01:17.424
is the opportunity to
contribute and to help

00:01:17.424 --> 00:01:19.328
your fellow citizens.

00:01:19.328 --> 00:01:22.115
And now I'm gonna hand it off to Aanand.

00:01:22.115 --> 00:01:23.856
who is our head of content in India.

00:01:23.856 --> 00:01:26.431
- I'm really very excited to invite you

00:01:26.431 --> 00:01:29.194
to Khan Academy India's
second talent search.

00:01:29.194 --> 00:01:32.073
We've been looking for teachers
to help us reach our mission

00:01:32.073 --> 00:01:35.626
of creating content that's
relevant to the Indian learners.

00:01:35.626 --> 00:01:38.342
Now one big piece of
this is to map a content

00:01:38.342 --> 00:01:39.759
to the Indian syllabus,

00:01:39.759 --> 00:01:41.361
which means the content that you create

00:01:41.361 --> 00:01:44.147
will be used directly by
teachers and students,

00:01:44.147 --> 00:01:47.955
millions of them, to help their
school experience directly.

00:01:47.955 --> 00:01:50.486
Now another big piece of
what we wanna do for India

00:01:50.486 --> 00:01:52.948
is to make Khan Academy's
content available

00:01:52.948 --> 00:01:55.386
in all major Indian languages.

00:01:55.386 --> 00:01:57.870
Now we already have Khan
Academy available in a few

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.565
Indian languages, but
we really wanna take it

00:01:59.565 --> 00:02:00.935
to the next step over here.

00:02:00.935 --> 00:02:02.351
Now to achieve both of these,

00:02:02.351 --> 00:02:04.441
in my opinion, the most
important thing is to find

00:02:04.441 --> 00:02:06.786
the right content creators.

00:02:06.786 --> 00:02:09.247
Not just creators who are
passionate about their subjects,

00:02:09.247 --> 00:02:11.268
but also creators who
are really passionate

00:02:11.268 --> 00:02:12.986
about making education available

00:02:12.986 --> 00:02:15.052
to millions of learners.

00:02:15.052 --> 00:02:17.351
And that's the primary
purpose of this talent search.

00:02:17.351 --> 00:02:20.045
We are looking for
science and math teachers

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:22.878
and content creators in five languages,

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:25.060
English and Hindi, but also Kannada,

00:02:25.060 --> 00:02:26.964
Tamil and Marathi.

00:02:26.964 --> 00:02:29.263
And we're looking to give out 10 winners,

00:02:29.263 --> 00:02:30.679
give out prizes for 10 winners,

00:02:30.679 --> 00:02:32.700
one winner and one runner's up in each of

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.418
these five languages.

00:02:34.418 --> 00:02:37.065
So if you are a creator
or if you know a creator,

00:02:37.065 --> 00:02:38.690
make sure you spread the word

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:41.732
and help as many people know
about this talent search

00:02:41.732 --> 00:02:43.474
and help us find the
right content creators

00:02:43.474 --> 00:02:45.006
to get closer to our mission.

00:02:45.006 --> 00:02:48.164
The last date for sending
your entries is December 17.

00:02:48.164 --> 00:02:51.531
And now I'm happy to introduce
two of last year's winners

00:02:51.531 --> 00:02:54.039
who now work with us, Mahesh and Ram,

00:02:54.039 --> 00:02:55.734
to say a little bit about their experience

00:02:55.734 --> 00:02:56.779
with Khan Academy.

00:02:56.779 --> 00:02:58.447
- Hi my name is Mahesh Shenoy.

00:02:58.447 --> 00:03:01.930
I was the winner of the last
year's India Talent Search,

00:03:01.930 --> 00:03:04.995
and now the newest and a proud member

00:03:04.995 --> 00:03:06.992
of Khan Academy Team India.

00:03:06.992 --> 00:03:08.432
Over the past two and a half years,

00:03:08.432 --> 00:03:10.545
I've been making YouTube physics videos,

00:03:10.545 --> 00:03:13.308
and so I've learned a great
deal about video creation.

00:03:13.308 --> 00:03:16.071
However, two days with this team,

00:03:16.071 --> 00:03:19.067
and I realized I have
so much more to learn.

00:03:19.067 --> 00:03:21.575
We are a small team of passionate people

00:03:21.575 --> 00:03:23.502
but with a huge mission,

00:03:23.502 --> 00:03:26.962
a mission to educate tens of millions

00:03:26.962 --> 00:03:28.726
of young lives of India.

00:03:28.726 --> 00:03:31.420
And if you feel you too
have the same passion,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:33.672
here's an opportunity to join us.

00:03:33.672 --> 00:03:37.689
- Hi, I'm Ram, one of last
year's Talent Search winners.

00:03:37.689 --> 00:03:40.150
I love physics, and I've been
teaching it for a long time.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:42.635
What I'm excited about
is that now I can help

00:03:42.635 --> 00:03:44.934
millions of kids in the
country love physics

00:03:44.934 --> 00:03:46.188
the way I do.

00:03:46.188 --> 00:03:48.417
And since the entire content is free,

00:03:48.417 --> 00:03:50.553
that means even the kids
who do not have a shot

00:03:50.553 --> 00:03:53.223
at quality education can
now educate themselves

00:03:53.223 --> 00:03:54.686
using my videos.

00:03:54.686 --> 00:03:56.939
So if you want to help us
in achieving our mission,

00:03:56.939 --> 00:03:58.564
please do send us your videos.

00:03:58.564 --> 00:04:02.186
And trust me, video creation
process is a lot simpler

00:04:02.186 --> 00:04:05.182
and more fun than it seems like.

00:04:05.182 --> 00:04:06.946
- Now when we evaluate your videos,

00:04:06.946 --> 00:04:09.268
we will look a lot more
at their content depth

00:04:09.268 --> 00:04:11.172
and explanation rather than fancy visuals

00:04:11.172 --> 00:04:12.426
or production value,

00:04:12.426 --> 00:04:14.725
so make sure that or rather don't hesitate

00:04:14.725 --> 00:04:17.906
to just point a camera at
a piece of paper or a board

00:04:17.906 --> 00:04:19.253
as you explain your idea.

00:04:19.253 --> 00:04:20.878
Remember that the last
date is December 17,

00:04:20.878 --> 00:04:23.711
and make sure you spread the word.
