00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:06.650
A DNA sequence is just a string of DNA letters in consecutive order. So for

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:10.190
example, over here on the left. Even though

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:13.460
this is double stranded DNA molecule, the DNA

00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.100
sequence is only read from one strand at a time. We would read either G, A, C,

00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:25.370
G, T, C, A, C, T, C, or C, T, G, C, A, G, T,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.850
G, A, G. The important thing to note is that, because of the base pairing rules

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:34.860
of DNA, if you know the sequence of one strand, Then we should already know the

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:39.550
sequence of the complementary strand. So if you just have the sequence on the

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:46.493
left, you would know that it pairs with C, T, G, C.

00:00:46.493 --> 00:00:53.350
A G T G A G. And

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.280
this is really useful for us in genetics. From now on,

00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:59.768
instead of writing out double-stranded

00:00:59.768 --> 00:01:02.430
DNA sequences, we'll write out single-stranded

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:06.990
sequences to keep things simple. When you see a string of

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.570
DNA letters like this We'll refer to this as a DNA sequence.
