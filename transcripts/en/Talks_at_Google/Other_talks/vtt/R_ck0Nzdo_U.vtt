MALE SPEAKER: OK, good
afternoon, everyone.

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:04.830
Thank you all so
much for coming.

00:00:04.830 --> 00:00:08.260
My name is [? Artur Olivera ?],
I'm in People Operations.

00:00:08.260 --> 00:00:11.860
And I'm very excited to welcome
today James Nestor to Google

00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.080
to talk about his book
"Deep, Freediving, Renegade

00:00:15.080 --> 00:00:18.400
Science, and What the Ocean
Tells Us About Ourselves."

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:21.670
James is a journalist and
freediver from San Francisco,

00:00:21.670 --> 00:00:27.090
and this book really follows
clans of extreme athletes,

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:29.660
adventurers, and scientists
who are transforming

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:32.560
not only our knowledge of
the planet and its creatures,

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:35.730
but also our understanding
of the human body and mind.

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.980
"Deep" was released
in July of 2014,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:41.280
and it's received a series
of awards, including

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:45.370
an Amazon Best Science Book
of 2014, BBC Book of the Week

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:48.870
and a Buzzfeed Best
Nonfiction Book of 2014.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.870
So without further ado,
if you could please help

00:00:50.870 --> 00:00:53.780
me welcome up James, and
he'll give you a presentation.

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:56.636
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:56.636 --> 00:00:58.764
JAMES NESTOR: Thanks a lot.

00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:00.180
All right, we'll
just get started.

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:01.940
I think you forgot your phone.

00:01:01.940 --> 00:01:04.819
You're gonna need
that some time.

00:01:04.819 --> 00:01:07.920
So a couple of years ago, I
was sent by "Outside" magazine

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.130
to cover something called the
World Freediving Championship.

00:01:11.130 --> 00:01:13.630
Now, this is a very
weird competition

00:01:13.630 --> 00:01:15.610
where competitors
challenge one another

00:01:15.610 --> 00:01:18.950
to see how deep they can
dive on a single breath

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.540
and come back to the
surface conscious.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.090
So I had never freedived before,
didn't know anything about it,

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:27.440
didn't know anyone who
had ever done this.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:29.190
So I was pretty
confused when I went out

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.860
to Greece-- that's where
the competition was held--

00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:34.024
and was sitting out on
this boat the first day

00:01:34.024 --> 00:01:34.815
of the competition.

00:01:34.815 --> 00:01:38.300
It was about six miles
off the coast of Kalamata.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.285
And the visibility in
the water was incredible,

00:01:40.285 --> 00:01:41.800
something like 200 feet.

00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:43.980
And I watched this
freediver come out,

00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:46.420
and he started breathing
really quickly,

00:01:46.420 --> 00:01:50.610
then he breathed really slowly,
upturned his body, and dove.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.210
And he kept diving and
kept diving and kept diving

00:01:54.210 --> 00:01:57.540
until he completely disappeared.

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:01.680
About four minutes later, I saw
his tiny figure rematerialize

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:02.330
in the water.

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:04.929
He came up to the
surface, took a breath,

00:02:04.929 --> 00:02:06.720
got out of the way for
the next competitor.

00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:10.520
He just dove 330 feet on
a single breath of air.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.455
So this completely blew my mind.

00:02:12.455 --> 00:02:15.600
I had no idea how the human
body was capable of diving

00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.960
to such depths for so long.

00:02:17.960 --> 00:02:22.020
So I remember that night I went
home, back to the hotel room,

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:22.604
called my mom.

00:02:22.604 --> 00:02:24.270
She didn't know where
in the world I was

00:02:24.270 --> 00:02:25.150
or what I was doing.

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:26.358
I said, there's these people.

00:02:26.358 --> 00:02:28.770
They can dive 300 feet, and
they can hold their breath

00:02:28.770 --> 00:02:30.420
for five minutes at a time.

00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.490
And she completely
didn't believe me.

00:02:33.490 --> 00:02:36.410
And she said, be sure to do
your fact-checking before you

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.870
publish this, because
these guys are obviously

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:39.870
cheating in some way.

00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.084
There must be an
air tank down there.

00:02:42.084 --> 00:02:43.750
But there wasn't an
air tank down there.

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:46.760
I did my fact checking,
and if there had been

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:49.860
and these guys had actually
taken a hit of air from it,

00:02:49.860 --> 00:02:52.220
their lungs would have
exploded as they ascended

00:02:52.220 --> 00:02:53.220
to the shallower depths.

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.390
They would have died.

00:02:54.390 --> 00:02:57.110
Only the human body
in its natural state

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.870
can survive a fast,
300-foot ascent.

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:02.710
So I got back home
to San Francisco,

00:03:02.710 --> 00:03:05.810
and I thought, wow, if I didn't
know about the human body's

00:03:05.810 --> 00:03:09.370
amazing amphibious abilities
to dive to such depths,

00:03:09.370 --> 00:03:11.010
what else don't I know about?

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:12.810
What are the other
secrets of the ocean,

00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.400
that human connection
to the ocean?

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:16.590
So I spent about two
years researching

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.060
this from the surface to the
very bottom of the deepest sea.

00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:22.357
And that's what the
book "Deep" is about,

00:03:22.357 --> 00:03:24.690
and I'm going to give you a
little preview of just a few

00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:26.850
of the sections in it.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.510
So we are born of the ocean.

00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:35.320
Each of us has about 98%
similar chemical composition

00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:38.820
of blood similar to seawater.

00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.820
The amniotic fluid in which
a fetus develops is about 99%

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.820
similar to seawater.

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.010
So perhaps it's a
coincidence, maybe not.

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:49.960
When we come out,
we're born to freedive.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.320
A human infant, when
placed in water,

00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.240
will reflexively open her eyes.

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:58.480
She'll begin breast stroking,
and she'll stay down there

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.810
on her own terms
for about 45 seconds

00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:03.370
at a time, arguably
longer than most adults.

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.280
We only we lose this ability
when we're taught how to walk.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:09.140
But gaining it is pretty easy.

00:04:09.140 --> 00:04:13.710
What I'm going to do now is
to follow down a 300-foot dive

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:16.570
by a French diver
named Guillaume Nery.

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.720
And I'm going to explain
all of these mammalian dive

00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.050
reflexes that trigger in
his body the deeper he goes.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:25.820
His body isn't really
anything special.

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.640
We all have these abilities.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.150
We're all born with these
reflexes, and all we have to do

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:31.070
is get in the water.

00:04:31.070 --> 00:04:32.020
They start triggering.

00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:34.900
Obviously, he's honed his
to go to great depths,

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:40.640
but anyone in reasonable health
can dive down 50, 100, even 150

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.540
feet on a single breath of air.

00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:45.740
So if you guys
get bored, you can

00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:47.450
try to hold your breath
as long as he is,

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:49.010
because this is in real time.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:50.490
It's about four minutes.

00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:52.330
So you can start now.

00:04:52.330 --> 00:04:54.550
So the second he
enters the water,

00:04:54.550 --> 00:04:56.410
something amazing happens.

00:04:56.410 --> 00:04:59.300
His heart rates going to
lower about 25% percent

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:00.725
of his normal resting rate.

00:05:00.725 --> 00:05:03.820
And blood is going to start
coursing from his extremities

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.270
into his core.

00:05:05.270 --> 00:05:09.480
His mind is going to enter
a very meditative state.

00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:12.045
Now, the deeper he goes,
the more these reflexes

00:05:12.045 --> 00:05:16.710
are going to be triggered,
until he eventually

00:05:16.710 --> 00:05:18.730
reaches almost a comatose
state in the water

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:20.830
while he's still conscious.

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.320
Right now, he's
at around 35 feet.

00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:27.510
Just past this depth, he will
enter into a negative buoyancy

00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:28.470
zone.

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:31.060
So the ocean, instead of
pulling him to the surface,

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.170
it's going to start pulling
him down to the sea floor.

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.150
And he will keep
dropping down until he

00:05:36.150 --> 00:05:37.900
reaches the very bottom.

00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:42.020
So you're going to see he's
about to kick off right now.

00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:46.232
He's about to kick
his legs a little bit.

00:05:46.232 --> 00:05:47.940
He's not going to move
his arms too much.

00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:52.650
He's just going to effortlessly
fall down into the ocean.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:55.710
So every 33 feet, he goes down.

00:05:55.710 --> 00:05:59.110
The air within his lungs
is going to shrink in half.

00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:01.230
So by around 100 feet,
the air in his lungs

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:03.580
is going to be about
the size of two fists.

00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:07.200
You can imagine how little air
is going to be at 300 feet.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:09.860
So his body really kicks
into overdrive now.

00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:11.660
His lungs will
engorge with blood

00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:14.000
to stop themselves
from caving in.

00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.130
His organ walls are
also going to allow

00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:19.630
for the freeflow
of water and plasma

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:21.350
to stop them from collapsing.

00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:23.400
His heart rate will
lower even more.

00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:25.870
This will allow him to
conserve more oxygen.

00:06:25.870 --> 00:06:27.990
Heart rates of freedivers
have been recorded

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:31.320
as low as 14 beats per minute.

00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:33.110
One freediver
recorded a heart rate

00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.531
as low seven beats per minute.

00:06:34.531 --> 00:06:35.905
So according to
our understanding

00:06:35.905 --> 00:06:38.310
of the human body, this
is totally impossible.

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:41.290
A heart rate that low can't
support consciousness.

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.800
And yet deep in the ocean, it
does, and no one knows how.

00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:48.750
So the further he
goes, his spleen

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:51.410
is going to release
new oxygenated blood

00:06:51.410 --> 00:06:55.120
into his bloodstream, which
he'll use as sort of a turbo

00:06:55.120 --> 00:06:58.820
drive to go even further
and stay down deeper.

00:06:58.820 --> 00:07:04.060
He's about to touch down now
the very bottom of the ocean.

00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.360
Again, this is supposed
to be at around 300 feet.

00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:09.770
And this is when it gets
really difficult for him.

00:07:09.770 --> 00:07:12.680
He's got to make it back up
against that pull of the ocean,

00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:14.440
back to the surface conscious.

00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.400
But as you will soon see,
Nery is very experienced.

00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:19.840
He's going to take his time.

00:07:19.840 --> 00:07:23.980
He's going to do a little
air guitar in here for you.

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.260
He knows to save around 60% of
his oxygen reserve for the trip

00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:29.520
back up.

00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:33.390
So as he goes back up, all
of those master switches

00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:36.630
within his body are
going to begin reversing.

00:07:36.630 --> 00:07:38.420
His mind is going to wake up.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:42.930
Blood is going to push from his
core back to his extremities.

00:07:42.930 --> 00:07:46.560
He's going to start resembling
his human form again.

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:49.740
When he's down this deep, he
can either choose to swim up

00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.865
or to climb cliffs up.

00:07:50.865 --> 00:07:52.240
It doesn't matter,
because that's

00:07:52.240 --> 00:07:55.080
all of the water
pushing against him.

00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:57.010
Freedivers don't
get the bends when

00:07:57.010 --> 00:08:00.070
they're diving under
their own natural ability.

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:02.380
The human body
naturally knows how

00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:06.760
to purge all that nitrogen
gas that has accumulated

00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:08.360
during the deep dive.

00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:11.960
And he's going to be purging
that here in a second.

00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:14.920
He's going to come up,
pause a little bit.

00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:17.900
It's been about three
minutes and 50 seconds.

00:08:17.900 --> 00:08:21.050
I know some of you are
still holding your breath.

00:08:21.050 --> 00:08:22.270
There he goes.

00:08:22.270 --> 00:08:24.030
And he's back at the
surface, and he's

00:08:24.030 --> 00:08:26.720
going to try to do it
even deeper next time.

00:08:26.720 --> 00:08:32.159
So those are the basics of
the mammalian dive reflex.

00:08:32.159 --> 00:08:35.409
So, competitive drivers
aren't the only ones

00:08:35.409 --> 00:08:38.220
that knew about this
mammalian dive reflex.

00:08:38.220 --> 00:08:40.929
Cultures around the
world have used it

00:08:40.929 --> 00:08:43.409
to harvest pearls,
food, sponges,

00:08:43.409 --> 00:08:44.870
whatever from the sea floor.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.280
They've been doing it for
literally tens of thousands

00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:47.780
of years.

00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:50.350
These are the
Japanese ama divers,

00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:53.110
who have been diving
for around 3,000 years.

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:56.030
When sailors went out
to Japan and saw them,

00:08:56.030 --> 00:08:58.260
they reported that they
were able to dive down

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:00.520
around 150 feet--
that's pretty good--

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.590
and stay down there
for 15 minutes

00:09:03.590 --> 00:09:08.050
at a time, which, of course,
is totally impossible.

00:09:08.050 --> 00:09:10.940
And all the scientists
who heard these stories

00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:15.640
in the 16th and 17th centuries
called the sailors' BS.

00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.540
They said, no,
people can't do that.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:18.650
You guys were drunk.

00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.780
You got it all wrong.

00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.360
Even up until the
1950s, scientists

00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:26.850
said the deepest a human could
possibly dive and survive

00:09:26.850 --> 00:09:28.060
was around 100 feet.

00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:31.380
Any deeper and our
lungs would collapse.

00:09:31.380 --> 00:09:37.360
Well, modern freedivers are
now diving down to 800 feet

00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:38.900
on a single breath of air.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.720
And the world record
breath hold is 12 minutes

00:09:42.720 --> 00:09:45.210
and 10 seconds, so just about
two and a half minutes shy

00:09:45.210 --> 00:09:47.040
of these fabricated reports.

00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:50.320
And these guys haven't been
doing this for this long.

00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.860
Just about 20 years
they've been competing.

00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:54.550
So if they keep
going at this rate,

00:09:54.550 --> 00:09:56.216
they're going to dive
deeper and deeper,

00:09:56.216 --> 00:09:58.760
hold their breath
longer and longer.

00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:01.760
But the good news here
is that freediving

00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.986
is much more than competition.

00:10:04.986 --> 00:10:06.360
When I was out
there in Greece, I

00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:09.320
saw the ace divers
make it down very deep,

00:10:09.320 --> 00:10:13.270
these incredible dives 300,
350 feet and come up just fine.

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:16.390
But a lot of people
didn't come up just fine.

00:10:16.390 --> 00:10:18.280
They came up conscious.

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.580
They came up with bloody noses.

00:10:20.580 --> 00:10:23.945
One guy was technically dead
for about two minutes before he

00:10:23.945 --> 00:10:25.230
was resuscitated.

00:10:25.230 --> 00:10:29.110
It was the most insane thing
I've ever seen in my life.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:32.070
And it was also kind
of sad and frustrating

00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:35.880
that they had honed this
incredible ability to dive deep

00:10:35.880 --> 00:10:38.240
and were just using
it, most of them,

00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:39.900
just for bragging
rights, to say, hey,

00:10:39.900 --> 00:10:41.330
I can dive deeper than you.

00:10:41.330 --> 00:10:44.720
Hey, I'll challenge you to see
how long I can hold my breath.

00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.610
But luckily when
I was out there,

00:10:46.610 --> 00:10:49.910
I met some much more
philosophical freedivers

00:10:49.910 --> 00:10:52.770
who use freediving as
kind of a meditation,

00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.490
like an underwater yoga.

00:10:54.490 --> 00:10:55.890
They never got hurt.

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.800
They never resurfaced
with bloody faces.

00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:01.320
And they never came
close to dying.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:04.220
They respected their
limits and used this

00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:07.420
as a way of exploring
the ocean environment

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.790
and their own
amphibious abilities.

00:11:09.790 --> 00:11:13.650
And they also started using
it for scientific research.

00:11:13.650 --> 00:11:16.850
And that's what I'm going
to talk about next here.

00:11:16.850 --> 00:11:19.460
Because something
else amazing happens

00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:22.180
when you freedive in the
ocean without scuba tanks,

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:24.510
without a boat,
without a submarine.

00:11:24.510 --> 00:11:26.900
Instead of animals
swimming away from you,

00:11:26.900 --> 00:11:28.490
as they do when you
have a scuba tank,

00:11:28.490 --> 00:11:32.270
if anyone's scuba dived
here, they turn around

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:33.340
and they swim toward you.

00:11:33.340 --> 00:11:36.560
They envelop you in their
shoals and schools and pods.

00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.590
And they will stay
there for hours.

00:11:38.590 --> 00:11:40.300
They get really curious.

00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:42.760
They don't look at
you as prey, either.

00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:44.980
Their prey doesn't go down
and look them in the eye

00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:45.810
and hang out.

00:11:45.810 --> 00:11:47.845
They look at you very curiously.

00:11:47.845 --> 00:11:50.230
And we'll see in a little
bit, dolphins and whales

00:11:50.230 --> 00:11:52.450
start sending their
communication whistles

00:11:52.450 --> 00:11:56.350
and clicks to you because they
think they can contact you.

00:11:56.350 --> 00:11:58.320
So it was with this
group that I was

00:11:58.320 --> 00:12:01.490
able to spend about 18 months.

00:12:01.490 --> 00:12:04.580
They showed me how to freedive
with whales and dolphins.

00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.620
They showed me this
completely other side

00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.120
of this activity, which
was about the furthest

00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:12.830
thing away from the competitive
side as you can imagine.

00:12:12.830 --> 00:12:14.850
One of the most
interesting things

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:18.430
I thought they were working
on was echo location and click

00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:23.490
communication with cetaceans,
which are dolphins and whales.

00:12:23.490 --> 00:12:27.630
Now, let's start a
little animation here.

00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.200
Eyes aren't much
good in the ocean.

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:33.910
Half the time, it's completely
black, because it's nighttime.

00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.130
And past around 1,500 feet,
it's completely black,

00:12:37.130 --> 00:12:40.130
because light can't
get down there.

00:12:40.130 --> 00:12:42.460
So what whales and
dolphins have done

00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:44.405
is they've developed
different senses.

00:12:44.405 --> 00:12:46.210
And we also have
these senses, and I'll

00:12:46.210 --> 00:12:47.920
show you that in just a minute.

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.830
A whale can echolocate.

00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.450
What they do is they
send out a click,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:54.935
and they wait for the echo
of that click to return.

00:12:54.935 --> 00:12:57.590
And they take that data,
and they form a picture

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.240
of everything around them.

00:12:59.240 --> 00:13:01.610
It's basically a form of sonar.

00:13:01.610 --> 00:13:04.950
And with this echolocation,
they can see better

00:13:04.950 --> 00:13:06.620
than we can see with our eyes.

00:13:06.620 --> 00:13:09.190
They can see a human
from a mile deep.

00:13:09.190 --> 00:13:12.150
And a dolphin can
see a rice grain

00:13:12.150 --> 00:13:15.350
from around 300 feet away
just with echolocation

00:13:15.350 --> 00:13:18.330
by clicking and waiting for
the return of that click

00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:20.460
to come back to them
under their jaws.

00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:22.400
They don't receive
it with their ears.

00:13:22.400 --> 00:13:24.060
They receive it
underneath their jaws,

00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:26.790
which has the equivalent of
around 10,000 little ears

00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:27.640
in it.

00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.920
So, this goes on for a while.

00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:30.420
We don't need to see that.

00:13:30.420 --> 00:13:34.010
So, humans aren't that
good at echolocation,

00:13:34.010 --> 00:13:36.270
but we're pretty good.

00:13:36.270 --> 00:13:38.420
This guy is Brian Bushway.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.190
He is completely blind.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.510
He lost his optic nerves
when he was 14 years old.

00:13:43.510 --> 00:13:46.450
But he's taught
himself to click just

00:13:46.450 --> 00:13:48.650
like whales and
just like dolphins

00:13:48.650 --> 00:13:53.060
and use those clicks to
form a picture in his mind.

00:13:53.060 --> 00:13:55.940
He lives a completely
independent life.

00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:59.420
He can ride his bike
down busy city streets.

00:13:59.420 --> 00:14:01.770
He camps alone in the woods.

00:14:01.770 --> 00:14:05.540
He travels alone to different
countries just by clicking,

00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:09.040
waiting for the echoes of
those clicks to come back.

00:14:09.040 --> 00:14:10.980
When some researchers
in Canada took

00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:12.890
him and some other
human echolocators

00:14:12.890 --> 00:14:16.130
and put them in an FMRI,
they had them echolocate,

00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:18.090
and they looked at their brain.

00:14:18.090 --> 00:14:22.450
They found that the visual
cortex of their brains lit up.

00:14:22.450 --> 00:14:25.560
So to them, it was
basically no different

00:14:25.560 --> 00:14:28.240
from what they were seeing
with the frequency of sounds

00:14:28.240 --> 00:14:30.050
to what you and I see
with the frequencies

00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:33.840
of light-- different frequency,
different sense, same end

00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:36.300
result.

00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:40.830
So humans are pretty
good at echolocation,

00:14:40.830 --> 00:14:44.020
again, not nearly as
good as the sperm whale.

00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:48.870
The clicks this animal makes
to use in its form of sonar

00:14:48.870 --> 00:14:51.866
can be heard hundreds
of miles away.

00:14:51.866 --> 00:14:53.240
Some researchers
believe they can

00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:54.910
be heard on the other
side of the planet

00:14:54.910 --> 00:14:58.950
and they can keep in contact
with one another that way.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:01.790
The clicks are so loud that
when you're diving with them,

00:15:01.790 --> 00:15:03.550
they can not only
blow out your ears,

00:15:03.550 --> 00:15:06.580
they can also vibrate
your body to death.

00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.430
So, what do freediving
researchers do?

00:15:09.430 --> 00:15:11.800
Well, of course
they dive with them.

00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.690
What I'm going to show you is
some footage from Mauritius.

00:15:14.690 --> 00:15:17.210
This was taken
about two years ago.

00:15:17.210 --> 00:15:20.990
And these are some freedivers
who are recording these clicks

00:15:20.990 --> 00:15:21.800
up close.

00:15:21.800 --> 00:15:24.472
They're the only people
that really have access

00:15:24.472 --> 00:15:25.180
to these animals.

00:15:25.180 --> 00:15:27.465
You can't do this with
scuba, with a rebreather,

00:15:27.465 --> 00:15:28.890
or on a boat.

00:15:28.890 --> 00:15:31.170
So it's a very
unique opportunity

00:15:31.170 --> 00:15:33.280
to look at their
behavior and correlate

00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:35.230
behavior with the clicks.

00:15:35.230 --> 00:15:37.340
So what's going to
be happening here

00:15:37.340 --> 00:15:41.360
is there is this little calf
who was going to be very

00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:43.800
curious about the cameraman.

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:46.420
And I'm just going to kind of
let you watch this and check it

00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:46.920
out.

00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:50.590
These clicks, again, are so loud
and so powerful you actually

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:51.960
feel them in your body.

00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.890
And your body starts
heating up after a while.

00:15:53.890 --> 00:15:55.060
It's like a CT scan.

00:15:55.060 --> 00:15:57.820
So without further ado--

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:03.460
[CLICKING]

00:16:03.460 --> 00:16:06.560
So all of these clicks, these
aren't coming from a boat.

00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:09.750
These are coming
from the whales.

00:16:09.750 --> 00:16:11.700
And this guy's going to
get a really good look

00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:14.708
at this cameraman.

00:16:14.708 --> 00:16:19.181
[CLICKING]

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:48.700
So again, he's collecting all
of the echoes of those clicks

00:16:48.700 --> 00:16:49.630
with his lower jaw.

00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:51.190
And you can watch
him flip around

00:16:51.190 --> 00:16:55.674
and start clicking more to get
a really good look at this guy.

00:16:55.674 --> 00:16:59.132
[CLICKING]

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.040
So these whales stayed
with those freedivers

00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.124
for about four hours
until the freedivers

00:17:13.124 --> 00:17:14.290
had to get out of the water.

00:17:14.290 --> 00:17:16.990
They were just too exhausted.

00:17:16.990 --> 00:17:20.210
So the next question I know
you're all wondering is,

00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:23.430
why the hell would
anyone want to do this?

00:17:23.430 --> 00:17:26.119
Why would you want to
freedive with the largest

00:17:26.119 --> 00:17:28.339
predator on the
planet, an animal that

00:17:28.339 --> 00:17:31.240
has eight-inch long
teeth that usually

00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:33.100
eats 60-foot long squid?

00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:37.230
You can see this guy could
so easily fit into his mouth

00:17:37.230 --> 00:17:41.030
and be munched without
the whale ever knowing.

00:17:41.030 --> 00:17:44.990
Well, again, the only way to
study sperm whales and dolphins

00:17:44.990 --> 00:17:48.780
up close and really record
their click communication

00:17:48.780 --> 00:17:49.850
is by freediving.

00:17:49.850 --> 00:17:51.430
Freediving is completely silent.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:53.060
It's noninvasive.

00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:55.670
The animals will welcome
you into their pods.

00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:57.830
And what they've
been finding out--

00:17:57.830 --> 00:18:00.360
they actually found this
out a couple decades ago,

00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:02.420
but now they're finding
out more information

00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:05.310
about it-- is those clicks you
just heard aren't just used

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:06.390
for echolocation.

00:18:06.390 --> 00:18:10.530
They're also used
for communication.

00:18:10.530 --> 00:18:13.680
This is what a sperm whale
click-- this is very pixelated.

00:18:13.680 --> 00:18:15.770
It looked a lot
better on my computer.

00:18:15.770 --> 00:18:18.810
But this is what it looks
like on a spectrogram, which

00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:21.590
is a visual readout
of an audio signal.

00:18:21.590 --> 00:18:24.940
So each of these clicks
are one second long.

00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:29.170
And inside of these clicks
are millisecond-long clicks.

00:18:29.170 --> 00:18:32.380
And inside of those clicks
are microsecond-long clicks.

00:18:32.380 --> 00:18:34.220
You could open this
up, and it just

00:18:34.220 --> 00:18:37.630
gets more and more detailed
as far as you want to go.

00:18:37.630 --> 00:18:40.410
Now, sperm whales can
replicate those clicks

00:18:40.410 --> 00:18:44.670
to the exact microsecond
over and over and over again

00:18:44.670 --> 00:18:47.150
in perfectly
synchronized patterns.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:49.910
And then they can change
small little bits,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:52.740
millisecond-long
clicks within those,

00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:56.770
and replicate those patterns
over and over and over again.

00:18:56.770 --> 00:18:58.590
So this isn't a random signal.

00:18:58.590 --> 00:19:00.190
It's not a dog barking.

00:19:00.190 --> 00:19:02.340
They're doing this deliberately.

00:19:02.340 --> 00:19:05.080
But we still don't
know exactly why.

00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:09.700
Many researchers believe that
it's a form of communication.

00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.000
But the communication isn't
tonal like a human language,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.110
but a digital form of
communication, something

00:19:16.110 --> 00:19:18.970
similar to a fax machine
transmission, which

00:19:18.970 --> 00:19:21.370
works the exact
same way by sending

00:19:21.370 --> 00:19:25.510
very distinct tones,
millisecond-long tones,

00:19:25.510 --> 00:19:26.460
through a phone line.

00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:30.240
These are some more
cetacean vocalizations.

00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:33.920
So I know that sounds
insane to many of you.

00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.180
Sperm whales, of course, don't
have a sophisticated form

00:19:37.180 --> 00:19:38.040
of communication.

00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:41.840
They can't exchange information
the way you and I can.

00:19:41.840 --> 00:19:45.070
And it probably should, but just
consider a few things first.

00:19:45.070 --> 00:19:47.010
These are two sperm
whales head on.

00:19:47.010 --> 00:19:49.190
This is what it looks like
when they approach you

00:19:49.190 --> 00:19:50.860
to welcome you into their pods.

00:19:50.860 --> 00:19:52.966
And I've had this
experience, and it really

00:19:52.966 --> 00:19:54.340
makes you doubt
what you're doing

00:19:54.340 --> 00:19:56.340
down there for the
first few minutes

00:19:56.340 --> 00:19:58.770
until they kind of soften up.

00:19:58.770 --> 00:20:01.190
But that big bulbous
thing on top,

00:20:01.190 --> 00:20:02.980
that's where their brain is.

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.950
Now, that brain is about
six times the size of yours.

00:20:06.950 --> 00:20:11.030
Sperm whales have had this
size brain for around 30 to 40

00:20:11.030 --> 00:20:12.640
million years.

00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:16.400
We've had our current-size
brain about 200,000 years.

00:20:16.400 --> 00:20:19.670
So in the scope of brain
evolution, that's a long time.

00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:23.490
Sperm whales have a neocortex,
which in humans governs things

00:20:23.490 --> 00:20:26.460
like reasoning, language.

00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:30.270
Their neocortex six
times the size of ours.

00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:32.140
And they also have
spindle cells.

00:20:32.140 --> 00:20:35.100
These are very highly
developed brain structures

00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:38.880
that neurologists have
associated with intuition,

00:20:38.880 --> 00:20:41.570
love, suffering,
and again language,

00:20:41.570 --> 00:20:44.320
all those things that
make humans human.

00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:46.300
So they not only
have spindle cells,

00:20:46.300 --> 00:20:49.670
they have them in a far larger
profusion then you an I do,

00:20:49.670 --> 00:20:52.420
and they've had them for
15 million years longer

00:20:52.420 --> 00:20:53.580
than we have.

00:20:53.580 --> 00:20:56.920
So animals don't grow
a huge brain randomly.

00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.720
A brain takes up
a lot of energy.

00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.830
It takes up about
20% of your oxygen.

00:21:02.830 --> 00:21:06.100
They're using this
brain for something.

00:21:06.100 --> 00:21:10.160
What are they doing when they
orient themselves like this

00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.070
and send clicks to one
another over and over again?

00:21:13.070 --> 00:21:15.270
They do this around
freedivers, too.

00:21:15.270 --> 00:21:17.370
At the beginning,
they echolocate you,

00:21:17.370 --> 00:21:20.240
and then they start sending
these communication clicks

00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:22.180
as they orient
themselves like this.

00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:27.690
It's one of the weirdest things
anyone can ever experience.

00:21:27.690 --> 00:21:29.690
So those are just
a few of the things

00:21:29.690 --> 00:21:32.240
these researchers are trying
to figure out right now.

00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:35.630
They're working with a group of
mathematicians and physicists

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:41.430
in France, trying to bust this
cetacean click communication

00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:42.580
code.

00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:45.350
They believe it's not
a linguistics problem,

00:21:45.350 --> 00:21:47.010
but a coding problem.

00:21:47.010 --> 00:21:48.470
And the way to
solve it isn't going

00:21:48.470 --> 00:21:52.450
to be by approaching it
through more academic means,

00:21:52.450 --> 00:21:55.480
but to involve some
coders and some people

00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:57.070
really into data
transmission who

00:21:57.070 --> 00:21:59.440
understand that to
try to figure out

00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:00.690
what these animals are saying.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:02.064
And that's hopefully
what they're

00:22:02.064 --> 00:22:04.200
going to be doing in the
next couple of years.

00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.320
We know they're talking.

00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:06.980
We know they're
talking to one another.

00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:08.530
We just don't know what
they're saying yet.

00:22:08.530 --> 00:22:10.410
And hopefully we're
going to figure that out.

00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.530
So in a nutshell, a
very brief nutshell,

00:22:13.530 --> 00:22:18.210
that's just part of the research
that I did for the book "Deep"

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:18.870
here.

00:22:18.870 --> 00:22:20.980
And the research is ongoing.

00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:24.130
These guys that I was
just profiling now

00:22:24.130 --> 00:22:26.790
got some funding to
do more expeditions.

00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:30.150
They've collected more
behavioral and communication

00:22:30.150 --> 00:22:32.590
data on sperm whales
in a few years

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:35.750
of freediving with them
than anyone in history

00:22:35.750 --> 00:22:38.260
has done through
institutional means.

00:22:38.260 --> 00:22:40.060
So whatever they're
doing is working,

00:22:40.060 --> 00:22:44.200
and hopefully we'll be able
to produce some real results

00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:45.290
in the next few years.

00:22:45.290 --> 00:22:48.660
So I guess we'll do
some questions now

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:50.130
if anyone happens to have any.

00:22:50.130 --> 00:22:56.000
I'll play some of this
in the background, just

00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.650
a little eye candy of what it's
like to dive with sperm whales.

00:23:01.650 --> 00:23:02.580
No questions?

00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:04.020
I answered all of them.

00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.049
Yes.

00:23:05.049 --> 00:23:06.590
AUDIENCE: How do
you know they're not

00:23:06.590 --> 00:23:09.880
as intelligent and sophisticated
in their communications

00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:11.270
with each other as--?

00:23:11.270 --> 00:23:14.360
JAMES NESTOR: Oh, I believe
that-- my personal subjective

00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:17.150
opinion, I believe their
communication is way

00:23:17.150 --> 00:23:19.280
more sophisticated than ours.

00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:22.270
Our human communication
is very prone to errors.

00:23:22.270 --> 00:23:25.070
In tonal communication, you
pronounce something slightly

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:26.420
wrong, you can't understand it.

00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.510
Digital form of communication
is very precise.

00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:33.180
So everything about their
brain size, the complexity

00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:35.600
and evolution of
their brains, you

00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:37.920
talk to any neuroscientist
that looks at this brain,

00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.990
they say absolutely this is an
extremely intelligent animal.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:23:43.830
We just haven't been
able to study them,

00:23:43.830 --> 00:23:46.440
because you can't put
this thing in a lab.

00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:49.220
You can't study it in
the wild until now.

00:23:49.220 --> 00:23:51.826
I mean, now they can
study them up close.

00:23:51.826 --> 00:23:54.200
And like I said, they're
getting more information on them

00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.910
now than they ever have before.

00:23:56.910 --> 00:23:58.110
So it's really exciting.

00:23:58.110 --> 00:24:01.580
I think that we're at a really
neat position right now where

00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:03.250
technology is cheap.

00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:04.740
It's readily available.

00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:06.950
And we now have access
to these animals

00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:10.560
to really collect some
great data on them.

00:24:10.560 --> 00:24:12.720
And I think that's something
is going to happen,

00:24:12.720 --> 00:24:14.790
something significant
is going to happen.

00:24:14.790 --> 00:24:17.910
So, yeah, just
subjectively, I'm absolutely

00:24:17.910 --> 00:24:19.620
certain they're intelligent.

00:24:19.620 --> 00:24:24.130
Once you dive with them, that
becomes apparent pretty soon.

00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.750
Yes, sir.

00:24:26.750 --> 00:24:31.430
AUDIENCE: So beyond
maternal bonding,

00:24:31.430 --> 00:24:35.402
which is, I think, pretty
common in cetaceans,

00:24:35.402 --> 00:24:36.860
is there any evidence
when you dive

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.640
with them of any other
emotional types of responses?

00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:44.460
Do you see any what
we would associate

00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:47.530
with human behaviors like
annoyance or affection

00:24:47.530 --> 00:24:51.760
or bonding beyond maternal
bonding, that kind of behavior?

00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.520
Do particular wales bond
with particular divers?

00:24:54.520 --> 00:25:00.140
Are you seeing any evidence
of emotional content?

00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:01.420
JAMES NESTOR: For sure.

00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:06.140
Sperm whales share more
cultural similarities

00:25:06.140 --> 00:25:08.680
to humans than any other
animal on the planet.

00:25:08.680 --> 00:25:13.030
They grow up with a matriarchal
society with their mothers

00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.470
and their aunts and
their grandmothers.

00:25:15.470 --> 00:25:18.250
The males, when they become
teenagers, form little gangs

00:25:18.250 --> 00:25:20.160
and go out and cause
trouble around,

00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.250
then they come back
around the equator

00:25:22.250 --> 00:25:23.830
every summer to hang out.

00:25:23.830 --> 00:25:27.300
So as far as diving with them,
I've had limited experience.

00:25:27.300 --> 00:25:28.750
I've done it a few times.

00:25:28.750 --> 00:25:34.070
They have literally 40, 50 solid
days of experience doing this.

00:25:34.070 --> 00:25:36.100
And what usually
happens is the calf

00:25:36.100 --> 00:25:38.450
can't hold its
breath for too long.

00:25:38.450 --> 00:25:41.800
So the mom goes down and gets
food, checks everyone out,

00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:43.680
cruises around,
echolocated everyone

00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:46.390
to make sure we're not a
threat, goes down and gets food,

00:25:46.390 --> 00:25:48.740
and leaves the calf
to play with us.

00:25:48.740 --> 00:25:51.940
So then it comes
back and hangs out.

00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:55.070
This guy right here,
Fred Buell, one

00:25:55.070 --> 00:25:57.680
of the world's
foremost freedivers,

00:25:57.680 --> 00:26:00.920
actually saw a sperm
whale give birth

00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:04.450
to a calf, which
is extremely rare.

00:26:04.450 --> 00:26:06.180
And he this all on video.

00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:08.140
All of the other
whales in the pod

00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.000
circled it and imprinted
it with its name

00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:14.320
through echolocation--
so really intense stuff.

00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:16.585
Again, we don't know exactly
what those clicks are,

00:26:16.585 --> 00:26:20.120
but hopefully they're going
to find out pretty soon.

00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.300
AUDIENCE: I'm
curious as to why you

00:26:22.300 --> 00:26:25.390
think that freediving is
a better way of getting

00:26:25.390 --> 00:26:28.030
at this than a rebreather.

00:26:28.030 --> 00:26:30.990
JAMES NESTOR: Because
I saw this firsthand.

00:26:30.990 --> 00:26:35.790
Out in Sri Lanka-- that's where
we did some of this research--

00:26:35.790 --> 00:26:38.550
we had to hop on these
little Panga boats, really

00:26:38.550 --> 00:26:39.940
sketchy situation.

00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.940
They were almost
drowning us every day.

00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:47.760
But what happened is you have
to be ready within a second

00:26:47.760 --> 00:26:49.060
to dive with the whales.

00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:52.470
You can't just cruise-- you
never put yourself on to them,

00:26:52.470 --> 00:26:54.490
because they can
just dive and go way.

00:26:54.490 --> 00:26:56.890
You have to park the
boat, turn off the motor,

00:26:56.890 --> 00:26:58.620
get in the water, and hang out.

00:26:58.620 --> 00:27:02.697
And 99.9% of the
time, they swim away.

00:27:02.697 --> 00:27:04.530
So it's only when they
choose to come to you

00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.020
that these encounters happen.

00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:08.200
You can never put
yourself on them.

00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:10.370
One of the photographers
had a rebreather,

00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:13.640
and it was quite hilarious,
because every time when

00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.390
it was on, when the
whales would approach,

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:18.607
suddenly they'd come up
from the very deep waters,

00:27:18.607 --> 00:27:19.690
we would get in the water.

00:27:19.690 --> 00:27:22.090
He'd be sitting there,
messing with his rebreather,

00:27:22.090 --> 00:27:23.150
trying to get it in.

00:27:23.150 --> 00:27:25.300
By the time we were done,
he'd get in the water

00:27:25.300 --> 00:27:26.680
and wouldn't get anything.

00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.810
Also, rebreathers make noise.

00:27:28.810 --> 00:27:30.870
They're much more
quiet than scuba,

00:27:30.870 --> 00:27:33.630
but there is some
exhale of bubbles.

00:27:33.630 --> 00:27:35.360
They're extremely
technical, too.

00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.550
So if you don't have them just
right, you're in big trouble.

00:27:39.550 --> 00:27:42.170
So the guy who had the
rebreather actually

00:27:42.170 --> 00:27:44.440
just left it at the hotel
room the next few days

00:27:44.440 --> 00:27:46.844
and learned how to freedive.

00:27:46.844 --> 00:27:48.434
AUDIENCE: How long
will he stay down?

00:27:48.434 --> 00:27:49.600
JAMES NESTOR: The freediver?

00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.130
AUDIENCE: Uh-huh.

00:27:51.130 --> 00:27:53.380
JAMES NESTOR: It really depends.

00:27:53.380 --> 00:27:56.780
You train to do this so you can
stay down maybe three minutes

00:27:56.780 --> 00:27:57.550
or so.

00:27:57.550 --> 00:28:00.550
But all that training
went out the window for me

00:28:00.550 --> 00:28:04.670
when you've got this 60foot
animal the size of a school bus

00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:05.490
approaching you.

00:28:05.490 --> 00:28:09.570
And my heart rate was just--
I couldn't stay very deep.

00:28:09.570 --> 00:28:10.950
But luckily, they didn't care.

00:28:10.950 --> 00:28:13.130
They were fine with me
hanging out at the surface,

00:28:13.130 --> 00:28:16.420
and I did some small dives
and then got more comfortable,

00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:17.980
and they got more comfortable.

00:28:17.980 --> 00:28:20.440
They have to go up for
air, too, and come down.

00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:22.830
So when they see
you doing it, they

00:28:22.830 --> 00:28:25.250
get really, really
interested when

00:28:25.250 --> 00:28:27.722
you're doing the same
thing that they're doing.

00:28:27.722 --> 00:28:29.180
And that's why, I
think, they allow

00:28:29.180 --> 00:28:31.602
us to hang around for so long.

00:28:31.602 --> 00:28:34.060
AUDIENCE: Can you talk a little
bit more about the training

00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:37.770
to become a freediver
and especially about

00:28:37.770 --> 00:28:40.970
the early stages, how you
start developing that skill?

00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:44.300
JAMES NESTOR: Yeah, well,
my entree into this world

00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:45.870
was through the competition.

00:28:45.870 --> 00:28:49.280
So the last thing I wanted
to do after that competition

00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:50.990
was to become a freediver.

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:53.100
It just looked absolutely nuts.

00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:56.820
And I still have some of those
horrible visions in my head.

00:28:56.820 --> 00:28:59.400
So it was a psychological
issue for me.

00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:04.220
I knew my body could stand
water for around four minutes,

00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.630
just like everyone else.

00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:07.920
But psychologically,
I just kept having

00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:10.890
those visions of those
guys who didn't make it up

00:29:10.890 --> 00:29:11.700
to the surface.

00:29:11.700 --> 00:29:14.720
So just slowly, I
started hanging out

00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:17.716
with the people that understood
it as more of a meditation,

00:29:17.716 --> 00:29:22.290
as a yoga practice, and was
able to get those visions out

00:29:22.290 --> 00:29:25.500
of my mind and get
these in there.

00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.840
And that made it a lot easier.

00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.120
So specifically to
answer your question,

00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.362
there is a number of breath
hold tables you can do.

00:29:33.362 --> 00:29:35.380
Do very deep breaths
for two minutes,

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.030
hold for two minutes, deep
breath for two minutes,

00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:41.340
hold for two and a half
minutes, like interval training.

00:29:41.340 --> 00:29:43.390
And that's how a lot
of freedivers do it,

00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:45.760
and that's what I do on
really boring flights

00:29:45.760 --> 00:29:48.690
to try to keep myself
in shape to do this.

00:29:48.690 --> 00:29:52.500
But you'd be amazed,
like you take

00:29:52.500 --> 00:29:56.770
about two hours of instruction,
and this stuff just immediately

00:29:56.770 --> 00:29:57.480
turns on.

00:29:57.480 --> 00:30:00.670
And something I just
want to mention again,

00:30:00.670 --> 00:30:03.400
I think it gets dangerous
when you do it competitively.

00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:06.790
Competitors don't think so,
but I've seen it otherwise.

00:30:06.790 --> 00:30:10.680
If you accept this as a natural
thing when you need to breathe,

00:30:10.680 --> 00:30:12.270
go up and breathe.

00:30:12.270 --> 00:30:15.300
If you don't feel like
diving deep, don't dive deep.

00:30:15.300 --> 00:30:17.340
The ama have been
diving for 3,000 years.

00:30:17.340 --> 00:30:21.312
There's no record of them ever
blacking out or ever having

00:30:21.312 --> 00:30:23.270
a problem, because they
listen to their bodies.

00:30:23.270 --> 00:30:26.630
So I think that's the
most important thing.

00:30:26.630 --> 00:30:30.010
AUDIENCE: I've heard a story
of a German businessman who

00:30:30.010 --> 00:30:33.200
was sailing out in
the ocean, and he

00:30:33.200 --> 00:30:34.980
said that he had
this dream that he

00:30:34.980 --> 00:30:37.250
needed to sail to the Azores.

00:30:37.250 --> 00:30:39.540
And he told everyone,
we're going to the Azores,

00:30:39.540 --> 00:30:42.450
and they sailed
toward the Azores,

00:30:42.450 --> 00:30:44.850
and they came across
a white sperm whale.

00:30:44.850 --> 00:30:47.700
And then they follow
the white sperm whale

00:30:47.700 --> 00:30:50.410
all the way to a pod,
like he was asking

00:30:50.410 --> 00:30:51.980
them to come to his family.

00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:54.890
And they sailed all the way
to the family of sperm whales.

00:30:54.890 --> 00:30:57.590
And they spent all day
swimming with them.

00:30:57.590 --> 00:30:59.950
And he said because
of that, it led

00:30:59.950 --> 00:31:02.562
him to start a whole
project across the Pacific,

00:31:02.562 --> 00:31:04.520
building these traditional
sailing [INAUDIBLE],

00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:07.320
and there's this whole film
that's being made on it.

00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:10.520
And I wonder, have you heard
anyone describe stories

00:31:10.520 --> 00:31:14.650
like that or interacted
with traditional peoples

00:31:14.650 --> 00:31:18.570
and their beliefs as
you've been out the sperm

00:31:18.570 --> 00:31:21.235
whales and the freedivers
who have been studying them?

00:31:21.235 --> 00:31:22.610
JAMES NESTOR: The
only story I've

00:31:22.610 --> 00:31:23.984
heard with the
white sperm whale,

00:31:23.984 --> 00:31:25.650
I read this book in college.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:27.450
I forget the name of it.

00:31:27.450 --> 00:31:31.260
But I actually haven't
heard that story.

00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.810
But I know that
this is something

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.160
that's growing right now.

00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:37.970
And some freedivers
are concerned about it,

00:31:37.970 --> 00:31:40.860
that a bunch of tourists
are going to go out and try

00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:42.050
to dive with these whales.

00:31:42.050 --> 00:31:45.040
But I'm not concerned about it,
because the whales can leave.

00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.246
They choose.

00:31:46.246 --> 00:31:48.870
So they'll choose whether or not
they want to dive with people.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.670
I think it's much more
disruptive to them

00:31:51.670 --> 00:31:53.860
to cruise around with
300 people on a boat

00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:57.180
and circle them and hope
to get a picture of them.

00:31:57.180 --> 00:31:59.860
When you cut a motor and
just go out in the water

00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:03.800
and wait for them to come to
you, it's a different thing.

00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:07.940
But I think, again with
GoPro technologies,

00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:10.440
there's so many YouTube
videos of people

00:32:10.440 --> 00:32:12.280
having these encounters
with sperm whales.

00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:15.930
And I mean, once you have one,
you're kind of forever screwed.

00:32:15.930 --> 00:32:17.630
I mean, it's all you want to do.

00:32:17.630 --> 00:32:19.970
It's all you can think about.

00:32:19.970 --> 00:32:21.975
And it's a pretty
powerful experience.

00:32:21.975 --> 00:32:25.150
So I think the more people
that do it, the better.

00:32:25.150 --> 00:32:26.819
Word gets out.

00:32:26.819 --> 00:32:28.360
MALE SPEAKER: Well,
James, thank you.

00:32:28.360 --> 00:32:29.450
Thank you so much.

00:32:29.450 --> 00:32:31.300
And that was a
lovely presentation.

00:32:31.300 --> 00:32:32.940
I think we all
certainly learned a lot.

00:32:32.940 --> 00:32:33.830
JAMES NESTOR:
Right, thanks a lot.

00:32:33.830 --> 00:32:34.030
MALE SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:32:34.030 --> 00:32:34.820
JAMES NESTOR: OK.

00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:36.370
[APPLAUSE]
