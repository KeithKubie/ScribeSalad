00:00:00.700 --> 00:00:06.190
&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington D.C.

00:00:06.190 --> 00:00:12.380
&gt;&gt; Robin Givhan: It is my
distinct pleasure to be able

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:15.540
to introduce Leland Melvin.

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:20.510
He is the definition
of a renaissance man.

00:00:20.510 --> 00:00:25.190
[ Laughter ]

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:26.810
I am clearly a comedian.

00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:32.690
He has been an NFL player for
the Detroit Lions, my hometown.

00:00:32.690 --> 00:00:34.790
Just throwing that out there.

00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:36.090
A NASA engineer.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.440
And an astronaut.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:45.240
He has also had his official NASA
portrait go viral because he posed

00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:48.280
with his two beloved dogs.

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:51.150
He is also a writer.

00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:56.970
And he is an engineer, who does not
just consider the science of space,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.980
but the poetry and the
magnificence of it.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:04.530
And he has written a memoir
of his extraordinary life --

00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:11.210
Chasing Space: An Astronaut's Story
of Grit, Grace, and Second Chances.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.110
He will also be signing
copies of his book

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:16.520
after his talk at two o'clock.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:19.510
It is my great pleasure
to introduce Leland.

00:01:19.510 --> 00:01:25.770
[ Applause ]

00:01:25.770 --> 00:01:28.340
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: Thank you.

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.030
Thank you, Robin.

00:01:31.030 --> 00:01:32.330
Thank you very much.

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:34.180
It is so great to be here.

00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:37.700
It is my first National
Book Festival and I am,

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.710
I am really honored and I
am really inspired by some

00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.680
of the other authors and just
what the Library of Congress

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:47.470 position:56%
and the city are doing to especially
inspire our next generation

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:50.610
of explorers, like our little
ones like sitting over here.

00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:54.260
And my title is the right stuff
is the never give up stuff

00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:57.820 position:56%
because I have had a lot of setbacks
throughout my life and journey

00:01:57.820 --> 00:02:00.640
and I have always had
someone, at least one person.

00:02:00.640 --> 00:02:02.720
I think this guy up here
in the front, Rudy King,

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:05.830
he was one of those people
that always had my back

00:02:05.830 --> 00:02:07.640
and always believed in me.

00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:09.720
And so I am going to
take you on this journey

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.810
that I have had over
my last 53 years.

00:02:13.810 --> 00:02:18.710
NFL, getting to space, things
that I never would have imagined

00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:20.010
that I would have done coming

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:22.600
from this small little town
of Lynchburg, Virginia.

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.070
So, let's go on the journey.

00:02:25.070 --> 00:02:28.080
And I think this is working.

00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:29.690
Houston we have a problem.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:36.360
Okay. If you think
about May of 1961,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.540
John F. Kennedy was petitioning
Congress to send a human being.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.170
He said a man, the
man space program.

00:02:42.170 --> 00:02:46.270
But I always change it to human
because when we say the language

00:02:46.270 --> 00:02:50.220
of a man space program, when I go
into schools and I ask the kids,

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:53.280
who wants to be an astronaut
and say man space program,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:55.670 position:56%
none of the girls raise their hands.

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.990
So the language is so important.

00:02:57.990 --> 00:03:00.620
So the human space program
he was petitioning Congress

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:06.130
for to send people to the moon
and back safely in May of 1961.

00:03:06.130 --> 00:03:11.110
At the same time, Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr. was going to the south

00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:13.860
to console the Freedom Riders
that were getting bombed.

00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:16.790
We were having the most
technologically advanced thing

00:03:16.790 --> 00:03:20.490
happening potentially in
the, in less than 10 years.

00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:21.790
And we were not even be able

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:24.840
to get our civil rights
straight here in our country.

00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:29.860
And I think about during
that same time in the 60's,

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.700
we had Gene Roddenberry with
Nichelle Nichols inspiring people

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.430
with Star Trek and the
Starship Enterprise.

00:03:38.430 --> 00:03:40.870
And she was the first
African American woman

00:03:40.870 --> 00:03:44.840
to play a leadership role
in the 60's on television

00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.160
that was not a servant or a maid.

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:50.630
And I remember talking to
Nichelle about this and she said,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:55.480
you know I was going to quit
the show early on and go back

00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.890
and do you know do
some theater and dance.

00:03:59.890 --> 00:04:02.950
And Gene held her resignation
over the weekend

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:04.700
for her to think about it.

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:11.090
She went to a NAACP meeting in Los
Angeles and bumped into someone

00:04:11.090 --> 00:04:13.980
who said they were
her number one fan.

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:18.810
That number one fan was Dr. Martin
Luther King Jr. He was like,

00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:21.990
oh my God it is Nichelle
Nichols [laughter].

00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:26.540
And she saw his enthusiasm
for the show.

00:04:26.540 --> 00:04:30.820
He even said, this is the only show
that I will let my kids stay up

00:04:30.820 --> 00:04:33.180
and watch at night
because you are doing

00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:36.690
with Star Trek what I am trying to
do with the Civil Rights Movement.

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:39.350
She tore up her resignation
and she stayed with the show.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.410
And NASA hired Nichelle to
bring in the first women

00:04:42.410 --> 00:04:43.980
and minorities as astronauts.

00:04:43.980 --> 00:04:46.530
She was on a contract to do that.

00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.440
Guy Bluford, Mae Jemison,
Sally Ride were all products

00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:57.560
of this Gene Roddenberry, Nichelle
Nichols combination of inspiration.

00:04:57.560 --> 00:05:00.650
Now, I watched a little Star Trek.

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:05.730
There was another guy who watched
Star Trek, who was Ronald McNair.

00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:09.860
Ronald McNair was on the
Challenger that perished in 86.

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:13.060
But when he saw Star Trek, he
said to his brother, he said,

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.420
Carl if there are women
like that in space,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:17.730
I want to go to space [laughter].

00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:21.000
So, art imitating life,
life imitating art.

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.480
This was a way that we
were helping inspire

00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:25.890
that next generation of explorers.

00:05:25.890 --> 00:05:27.520
And in May.

00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:30.630
In July of 1969 you know one small.

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:31.930
Back to that man thing.

00:05:31.930 --> 00:05:35.440
One small step for a human,
one giant leap for humankind.

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:36.740
We were walking on the moon.

00:05:36.740 --> 00:05:38.340
I was five years old.

00:05:38.340 --> 00:05:42.650
And I remember seeing this
grainy picture on the television

00:05:42.650 --> 00:05:45.050
and I will never forget after that,

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:48.000
kids were asking me hey do
you want to be an astronaut.

00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.300
I am like, no [laughter].

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:52.540
I did not see someone
who was like me.

00:05:52.540 --> 00:05:55.140
And they had these military
guys with buzz cuts.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:57.490
And that was not me.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:00.350
And I grew up in a small
town of Lynchburg, Virginia.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.210
I lived on Pierce Street.

00:06:02.210 --> 00:06:05.960
On Pierce Street there was a
doctor named Dr. Whirlwind Johnson,

00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.930
who was the first African
American doctor

00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.300
to integrate the local
hospital where I was born.

00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.670
He was also.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:15.970
Well there was.

00:06:15.970 --> 00:06:17.270
There is me.

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:18.570
And then this is my sister and I

00:06:18.570 --> 00:06:21.500
on Pierce Street wearing my
mother out okay [laughter].

00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.750
We were always doing things
to wear her out, okay.

00:06:24.750 --> 00:06:28.010
But here is Whirlwind Johnson
on the right in both pictures

00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:29.500
and he was a tennis coach.

00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:30.860
He was a doctor.

00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:34.410
He trained Arthur Ash in Lynchburg.

00:06:34.410 --> 00:06:38.360
Arthur lived in Richmond, would
come in the summers to Lynchburg,

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.840
five blocks from where I
lived training Arthur Ash.

00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:45.640
My dad always talked about
Arthur Ash and his character

00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.300
and his discipline
and his athleticism.

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.200
Brilliant man.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:53.650
Althea Gibson similarly brilliant.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:57.200
Won every tournament, every
tournament known to humankind.

00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.250
I wanted to be Arthur Ash.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.860
I still play tennis to this day

00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:04.810
because of the influence
that he had on my life.

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:07.580
And I think about this
street, Pierce Street.

00:07:07.580 --> 00:07:10.840
When I was writing this book,
Chasing Space, I went back

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.670
and did a little research about the
people that lived on Pierce Street

00:07:13.670 --> 00:07:16.100
that helped change my life.

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.480
And I did not even
know it at the time.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.230 position:56%
There was a gentleman named Chauncey
Spencer, who was the son of poet,

00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:27.530
Anne Spencer, from the Harlem
Renaissance, who lived four blocks

00:07:27.530 --> 00:07:29.710
down the street from where I lived.

00:07:29.710 --> 00:07:34.170
Chauncey was, wanted to be
an aviator as a young kid.

00:07:34.170 --> 00:07:37.960
Went to the local [inaudible]
airport, Lynchburg Airport

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.660
and went to take flying lessons.

00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:46.450
And they said we do not give
flying lessons to your kind.

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:49.580
He moved to Chicago to
take lessons at Love Field

00:07:49.580 --> 00:07:52.700
from an African American
mechanic who could fly.

00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:56.490
And eventually Chauncey
and his buddy got

00:07:56.490 --> 00:08:00.910
in the Lincoln-Page Tail Dragger
airplane and flew to Washington.

00:08:00.910 --> 00:08:06.340
And petitioned Harry S. Truman,
at the time who was a congressman,

00:08:06.340 --> 00:08:09.670
to allow blacks to
fly in the military.

00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:13.260
This is how the Tuskegee
Airmen were born.

00:08:13.260 --> 00:08:16.080
Harry S. Truman raised
three million dollars

00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:19.090
to allow black aviators to fly.

00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.980
And so I think about Pierce Street.

00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.270
This street of inspiration.

00:08:23.270 --> 00:08:27.150
This street of Arthur Ash inspired
me to be a great tennis player.

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:31.340
And to have discipline and
have character and empathy.

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:33.930
And Chauncey Spencer one block away

00:08:33.930 --> 00:08:38.840
from him getting me
setup to go to space.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.140
And how many other.

00:08:40.140 --> 00:08:42.090
We think about, you know,
Margot was here earlier talking

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.390
about Hidden Figures.

00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:46.330
How many other figures have
been hidden from us for so long?

00:08:46.330 --> 00:08:48.990
That we could inspire our
kids to believe and think

00:08:48.990 --> 00:08:51.080
that they could do these things.

00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:53.970
And literacy, you know
this conference is

00:08:53.970 --> 00:08:56.870
about the American story.

00:08:56.870 --> 00:09:00.760
And literacy is such a big
part of that American story.

00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:05.300
I think last night they said
that 45 million people have less

00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:09.180
than a fifth grade reading level.

00:09:09.180 --> 00:09:11.820
And that means economic
disadvantages

00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.120
because they cannot read.

00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:16.190
And I think that all
of you who are here,

00:09:16.190 --> 00:09:18.790
especially with your kids
helping read to them,

00:09:18.790 --> 00:09:20.360
like my mother did
every night to me.

00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.850
The Little Engine That Could,
I think I can, I think I can.

00:09:22.850 --> 00:09:25.970
That was a mantra before I could
even read, I was thinking I can.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.270
I think I can.

00:09:27.270 --> 00:09:31.160
And then you know, Curious
George, you know [laughter].

00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:34.040
The very curious adventurous
little guy

00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:36.230
who would explore and
get in trouble.

00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:37.880
And that was me.

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:40.420
So, I had I think I can belief that
I can get in trouble [laughter].

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.360
And I did many times.

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:47.960
But over the summers my parents
were middle school teachers,

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.890
we went on these camping trips.

00:09:49.890 --> 00:09:52.290
My dad, when I asked
him for a skateboard,

00:09:52.290 --> 00:09:55.020
he said we do not have
the money for it.

00:09:55.020 --> 00:09:57.350
And this is when I
became an engineer.

00:09:57.350 --> 00:09:59.660
He said, figure it out.

00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.240
A piece of wood, a machine shop,

00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:05.950
a paper route to get
the wheels and trucks.

00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:08.140
I built a skateboard.

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:10.000
Something I wanted.

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:12.660
And I realized what
engineering was about.

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:16.780
It was not until my dad drove
this bread truck into our driveway

00:10:16.780 --> 00:10:20.760
that I understood what
vision was about.

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.180
He was a language arts teacher.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:23.580
He was not an engineer.

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:25.510
He was not a scientist.

00:10:25.510 --> 00:10:29.980
But he over this summer convinced
me that we were not going

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.100
into the bread business because he
did a lot of different odd jobs.

00:10:34.100 --> 00:10:36.980
This summer we converted this
bread truck, that said Merita Bread

00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:41.400
and Rolls on the side,
into our camper.

00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:43.690
When we rewired the
electrical system,

00:10:43.690 --> 00:10:44.990
I became an electrical engineer.

00:10:44.990 --> 00:10:47.740
When we built the bunk beds
that flipped down inside,

00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.380
I was a mechanical engineer.

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.880
When we plumbed the propane
tank in the Coleman stove,

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:53.970
I was a chemical engineer.

00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:57.310
But it was not until we
painted the side of the van

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:59.340 position:56%
that I really saw this as our camper

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.860
because all I could see
was Merita Bread and Rolls.

00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:04.460
And it even smelled like bread too.

00:11:04.460 --> 00:11:08.540
So. But these were all things
setting me up for a life

00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.550
as a scientist and as an engineer.

00:11:10.550 --> 00:11:16.440 position:56%
And when my mother gave me the
non-OSHA certified agent appropriate

00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:20.290
chemistry set, this
is when I realized

00:11:20.290 --> 00:11:22.450
that I could be a scientist.

00:11:22.450 --> 00:11:24.000
And this is kind of
how it played out.

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:25.780
So, here you go son.

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:28.880
Make sure you read the
instructions, right?

00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:30.790
Yeah right [laughter].

00:11:30.790 --> 00:11:32.090
Yeah I read them, ha ha.

00:11:32.090 --> 00:11:35.090
Yeah. And the next thing I
know I mixed this concoction

00:11:35.090 --> 00:11:37.370
and blew up her living room.

00:11:37.370 --> 00:11:39.600
Burned a hole in her carpet.

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.730
She had a big hand in my
development, you know.

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:45.670
She came from downtown
with that hand, you know.

00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:50.130
I did not believe in corporal
punishment and I still do not.

00:11:50.130 --> 00:11:53.130
But my brain was activated.

00:11:53.130 --> 00:11:55.470
I knew that I could be a scientist.

00:11:55.470 --> 00:11:58.650
And I ended up being a chemistry
major in college because of

00:11:58.650 --> 00:12:02.520
that intervention, because
of that one intervention.

00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.330
So the engineering, the
science, the music, the math,

00:12:06.330 --> 00:12:10.590
all these things helped me believe
that I could do these things.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:12.550
The I think I can.

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:16.780 position:56%
The curiosity of Curious George were
all things that set me on that path.

00:12:16.780 --> 00:12:18.080
Sports was very important.

00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:22.080
I played football, a little
bit of football, you know.

00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:24.850
And by the way, Robin, I
know Detroit is your home.

00:12:24.850 --> 00:12:27.430
I am not a Lions fan because
they cut me [laughter].

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:32.110
So there is no allegiance
to Detroit anymore okay.

00:12:32.110 --> 00:12:34.940
But growing up playing
football it was you know fun.

00:12:34.940 --> 00:12:36.240
I had a good time.

00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:37.540
Tennis was my love.

00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:42.410
I had this one moment in my
life as a senior in high school.

00:12:42.410 --> 00:12:43.710
Any football players in here?

00:12:43.710 --> 00:12:45.450
Any high school players?

00:12:45.450 --> 00:12:47.380
Any younger players?

00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:48.830
Got a football player over here.

00:12:48.830 --> 00:12:50.840
A wide receiver does what?

00:12:50.840 --> 00:12:52.140
[Inaudible].

00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:54.700
And does what?

00:12:54.700 --> 00:12:56.390
Catches the ball, right?

00:12:56.390 --> 00:12:59.560
I was a wide receiver
on a running team,

00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.630
which means I block a lot, right?

00:13:02.630 --> 00:13:04.010
My moment came.

00:13:04.010 --> 00:13:05.940
We were down by a touchdown.

00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:07.400
I am running down the sideline.

00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.700
I am running.

00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:10.000
I am running.

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.300
The crowd is screaming.

00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:12.600
You all scream.

00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.900
I am running and running
[laughter], the crowd is screaming.

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.200
The ball is coming into my hands.

00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.920
I am like going to catch
this ball and win the game.

00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:20.740
By a show of hands, how many
of you think I caught the ball?

00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:22.040
[Laughter].

00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:26.000
By a show of hands, how many of
you think I dropped the ball?

00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:27.550
By a show of hands, who
does not really care?

00:13:27.550 --> 00:13:28.850
[Laughter].

00:13:28.850 --> 00:13:32.100
Okay because none of, a lot of
you did not raise your hands.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:36.580
I dropped the touchdown pass
in my hands in the end zone.

00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:37.880
Homecoming game.

00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:39.390
All my friends were there.

00:13:39.390 --> 00:13:40.860
My family was there.

00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:42.980
I felt like I was about this big.

00:13:42.980 --> 00:13:44.280
Walked to the sideline.

00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.160
My coach, Jimmy Green,
grabbed me by the facemask.

00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:50.090
I was waiting to be like
ejected onto the bench.

00:13:50.090 --> 00:13:51.990 position:56%
And he said to me, I believe in you.

00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:55.550
Go back out there and catch the
ball this time, okay [laughter].

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:58.570
So I am running down the
sideline the second time.

00:13:58.570 --> 00:13:59.870
I am running.

00:13:59.870 --> 00:14:01.170
I am running.

00:14:01.170 --> 00:14:02.470
The ball is coming.

00:14:02.470 --> 00:14:03.770
The crowd is screaming.

00:14:03.770 --> 00:14:05.070
I am running and running and
running and running and running.

00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:06.870
I could read Spaulding
on the side of the ball.

00:14:06.870 --> 00:14:08.630
I was so laser beam focused.

00:14:08.630 --> 00:14:11.550
I caught the ball.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.670
Unbeknownst to me, there was a
college scout from the University

00:14:14.670 --> 00:14:15.970
of Richmond who was looking to see

00:14:15.970 --> 00:14:17.770
if I could play football
at Richmond.

00:14:17.770 --> 00:14:22.700
He walked out of the
stadium on the first drop.

00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.580
He heard the crowd screaming
the second time and he came back

00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:31.600
in the stadium and he looked over
and he saw me in the end zone

00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:32.960
like you know [laughter].

00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:39.440
That one catch resulted in a
180 thousand dollar scholarship

00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.710
to the University of
Richmond [applause].

00:14:41.710 --> 00:14:44.010
And the reason.

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:46.660
I think I can, right?

00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:51.020
The reason he gave me
that opportunity is

00:14:51.020 --> 00:14:53.870 position:56%
because he said you did not give up.

00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:55.640
The grit. The perseverance.

00:14:55.640 --> 00:14:56.940
The grace.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:00.550 position:56%
All those things that I have talked
about in the book, he believed in me

00:15:00.550 --> 00:15:02.250
because I did not give up.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:05.070
And that is the message
that I have tried to put

00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:09.630
to weave throughout the book is
that opportunities come to you,

00:15:09.630 --> 00:15:12.170
but you have to be prepared
for that opportunity.

00:15:12.170 --> 00:15:14.390
And having that one
person in your life.

00:15:14.390 --> 00:15:18.080
All you need is one that has
your back and believes in you.

00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:20.110
And I had many of those people.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:21.630
But he was one of them.

00:15:21.630 --> 00:15:24.470
Went to Richmond, football
scholarship, majored in chemistry.

00:15:24.470 --> 00:15:29.330
Was still blowing things up, but
now I could legally do it you know

00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:31.720
and not get a spanking
from my mother.

00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:34.500
Played football there O
and 10, three and eight.

00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.470
We did not do too well my
freshman year or my sophomore year.

00:15:37.470 --> 00:15:39.510
But we ended up going to
the play offs my junior

00:15:39.510 --> 00:15:41.090
and senior year because we kept on.

00:15:41.090 --> 00:15:42.390
We did not give up.

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.630
And then I got drafted
to the Detroit Lions.

00:15:44.630 --> 00:15:47.440
Detroit, yeah Robin, yeah.

00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.320
Detroit Lions in the 11th round.

00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:52.250
Pulled a hamstring
muscle in training camp.

00:15:52.250 --> 00:15:55.180
And then I came back
home and my agent said,

00:15:55.180 --> 00:15:57.820
Dallas wants to sign
you for the next season.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:16:04.750
So I have from August of 1986
until maybe March of 1987 to figure

00:16:04.750 --> 00:16:07.510
out what I am going to do with
my life for those few months.

00:16:07.510 --> 00:16:10.760 position:56%
And this professor at the
University of Virginia said come up,

00:16:10.760 --> 00:16:13.170
I want to talk to you about
being a research assistant here.

00:16:13.170 --> 00:16:16.550
I am like, but I am going
to play football, man.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.970
You know. Research assistant

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:20.550
and football do not
really you know match.

00:16:20.550 --> 00:16:21.850
I go up there.

00:16:21.850 --> 00:16:24.130
I start working for him
as a research assistant.

00:16:24.130 --> 00:16:26.580
And then when the January
semester started

00:16:26.580 --> 00:16:28.730
for material science engineering,

00:16:28.730 --> 00:16:32.050
I enrolled knowing I would
be leaving in three months.

00:16:32.050 --> 00:16:36.450
And I went to UVA,
started the program.

00:16:36.450 --> 00:16:38.850
And then they videotaped
the courses, VHS [laughter].

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:43.200
Old school, right.

00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:46.690
So by day I am catching
footballs for America's team.

00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:50.190
I mean they cut me too so I do not.

00:16:50.190 --> 00:16:53.040
You know, we are in
[inaudible] territory right.

00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:55.430
But. And I was playing football

00:16:55.430 --> 00:16:56.920
and watching material
science engineering.

00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.850
And when I pulled my
hamstring for the second time,

00:16:58.850 --> 00:17:00.150
it was the end of my
football career.

00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:02.790
That is when I went right back
and finished my master's degree

00:17:02.790 --> 00:17:05.090
at the University of Virginia.

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.810 position:56%
And so that was my foray in the NFL.

00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:10.970
This was the last catch
in a preseason game.

00:17:10.970 --> 00:17:15.540
But I had that second
chance for my academics.

00:17:15.540 --> 00:17:20.960 position:56%
And NASA Langley Research Center, I
worked there as a research scientist

00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.250
with my friend, Rudy King, here.

00:17:23.250 --> 00:17:26.580
And we were developing
sensors to help

00:17:26.580 --> 00:17:28.880
with the space shuttle
and the space program.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.350
And a friend of mine said, Leland
you would be a great astronaut.

00:17:32.350 --> 00:17:35.830
And I am like, yeah right.

00:17:35.830 --> 00:17:38.230
He saw something I
did not see in myself.

00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:39.920
And he handed me an application.

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.220
I looked at it.

00:17:41.220 --> 00:17:42.520
I did not fill out.

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.390
But another friend of mine filled
the application out and he got in.

00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:50.280
And I said to myself, if NASA is
letting knuckleheads like that

00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.950
in to be astronauts,
maybe I can be one too.

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:59.040
So I applied in the next selection,
which was 1987 for the 1988 class.

00:17:59.040 --> 00:18:00.460
And I got in.

00:18:00.460 --> 00:18:06.040 position:56%
And I think about all the people
that have been in the space program.

00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:07.340
362 people.

00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.670
I am in there somewhere.

00:18:09.670 --> 00:18:11.170
I had this opportunity.

00:18:11.170 --> 00:18:16.210
This small kid from Lynchburg,
Virginia being one of 362 Americans

00:18:16.210 --> 00:18:19.600
to have an opportunity
to fly in space.

00:18:19.600 --> 00:18:25.780 position:56%
Now, our class was 25 U.S. out of
25 hundred people, 25 were selected.

00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:28.870
And we had six international
astronauts.

00:18:28.870 --> 00:18:32.050
Now, can you guys find me
in the picture anywhere?

00:18:32.050 --> 00:18:35.610
[Laughter].

00:18:35.610 --> 00:18:38.330
In the front row.

00:18:38.330 --> 00:18:40.290
On the side.

00:18:40.290 --> 00:18:42.790
Let me give you a little
hand there [laughter].

00:18:42.790 --> 00:18:44.170
There is Leland in there.

00:18:44.170 --> 00:18:47.970
A very diverse group of people.

00:18:47.970 --> 00:18:50.160
Navy, Air Force, Marines.

00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.120
It was an incredible class
of people working together

00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.540
to help advance our civilization.

00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:00.460
And I was in Russia for two
years working with the first crew

00:19:00.460 --> 00:19:02.780
that was going to the
International Space Station.

00:19:02.780 --> 00:19:05.440
Bill Shepherd, Yuri
Gidzenko and Sergei Krikalev.

00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.920
And we did all this training.

00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:09.680
And I was doing pushups
in the zero G airplane,

00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:12.960
which is affectionately
known as the vomit comet.

00:19:12.960 --> 00:19:14.430
But we were doing all these things

00:19:14.430 --> 00:19:16.620
to get these guys ready
to fly in space.

00:19:16.620 --> 00:19:17.960
Expedition one.

00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:19.550 position:56%
The first crew to the Space Station.

00:19:19.550 --> 00:19:25.080
And when I came home, it was
time for me to do more training.

00:19:25.080 --> 00:19:26.830
This is the Neutral
Buoyancy Laboratory.

00:19:26.830 --> 00:19:29.190
It is a six million gallon pool

00:19:29.190 --> 00:19:32.980
that we have a submerged space
station and space shuttle.

00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:37.770
We go about 30 feet deep in
this pool to do this training.

00:19:37.770 --> 00:19:42.290
And you do it in this white
Michelin man looking suit.

00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:46.810
There is one little piece of
hardware that goes in the suit

00:19:46.810 --> 00:19:52.120
that can be very critical to
your success in the water.

00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:55.220
There is a pad called
a Valsalva pad.

00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:58.200
It is a Styrofoam block that
you press your nose against.

00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.580
That if you are the kind
of person that needs

00:19:59.580 --> 00:20:01.660
to squeeze your nose to clear.

00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:04.020
That allows you to press
your nose against it

00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:06.990
in the helmet to clear your ears.

00:20:06.990 --> 00:20:10.870
I am the kind of person that
needs to squeeze to clear.

00:20:10.870 --> 00:20:14.010
They forgot to put mine in.

00:20:14.010 --> 00:20:17.140
We go down about 20 feet
and I tell the test director

00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:19.360
to turn the volume
in the headset up.

00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:22.580
I hear nothing from
static from that point on.

00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:24.270
They are taking me up and down

00:20:24.270 --> 00:20:26.200
in the pool trying to
get my ears to clear.

00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:29.620
And I do not hear anything.

00:20:29.620 --> 00:20:33.920
Let's back up four days
before this thing happened.

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.930
My parents were having their
35th wedding anniversary

00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:37.230
in Lynchburg, Virginia.

00:20:37.230 --> 00:20:39.030
Not far from Pierce Street.

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:40.450
My cousin was in the car with me.

00:20:40.450 --> 00:20:42.980
I was dropping them off at a hotel.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.640
And she had her friend
with her named Janette.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:50.120
Janette said to me, something
is going to happen to you.

00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:53.220
No one is going to
know why this happened.

00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:54.810
You will be healed of this.

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:57.010
You will fly in space.

00:20:57.010 --> 00:20:59.400
This will be your testimony
you share with the world.

00:20:59.400 --> 00:21:04.720
And I am like, um [laughter], okay.

00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:08.590
I had just come back from
Russia with the first crew.

00:21:08.590 --> 00:21:10.210
The next four days later I am going

00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:14.390
to start my training
to be a space walker.

00:21:14.390 --> 00:21:16.410
And the first people
to get their training

00:21:16.410 --> 00:21:19.350
to be space walkers were building
an international space station.

00:21:19.350 --> 00:21:22.100
You need space walkers to do that.

00:21:22.100 --> 00:21:26.950
She is telling me something
is going to happen to me.

00:21:26.950 --> 00:21:28.690
And I listen to people, you know.

00:21:28.690 --> 00:21:31.140
I did not shut her down.

00:21:31.140 --> 00:21:35.060
Four days later, I
am completely deaf.

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:36.360
They take me out of the pool.

00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:37.920
They take my helmet off.

00:21:37.920 --> 00:21:41.200
The flight surgeon walks over
to me and he is talking to me.

00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.190
I think he is joking with me
because he is moving his lips

00:21:45.190 --> 00:21:46.490
and I do not hear anything.

00:21:46.490 --> 00:21:48.260
He touches my right ear.

00:21:48.260 --> 00:21:51.000
He pulls his finger back and
I feel the blood streaming

00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.120
down the side of my face.

00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:56.850
They rush me to the hospital.

00:21:56.850 --> 00:21:59.640
And these are the faces
of my surgeons [laughter].

00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:05.820 position:56%
Does not look to optimistic does it?

00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:07.260
They went in and operated.

00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.770
They went in to look around to see

00:22:08.770 --> 00:22:12.280
if I had something called a
purulent fistula where the,

00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.860
I was leaking out of my
ears, on the inner ear,

00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:18.180
the oval and circular windows.

00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:19.480
And they could not find anything.

00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.570
Everything was intact.

00:22:21.570 --> 00:22:25.650
And about three weeks later,
my hearing slowly came back.

00:22:25.650 --> 00:22:30.560
I am still impaired in my left ear,
probably 90 percent of it is gone.

00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.390
So as an astronaut hearing
is kind of important, right?

00:22:33.390 --> 00:22:39.370
And they immediately medically
disqualify me to fly in space.

00:22:39.370 --> 00:22:41.810
They said you are never
going to fly in space.

00:22:41.810 --> 00:22:43.830
My doctors told me that.

00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.050
And I was trying to conjure up all
these things, the Little Engine

00:22:46.050 --> 00:22:47.580
That Could, I think
I can, I think I can.

00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:48.880
Curious George.

00:22:48.880 --> 00:22:50.810
All these things.

00:22:50.810 --> 00:22:53.310
And when I opened my laptop
up and watched a movie,

00:22:53.310 --> 00:22:59.210
I realized when I could not
hear the sound that I was deaf.

00:22:59.210 --> 00:23:00.780
My friends consoled me.

00:23:00.780 --> 00:23:02.830
The people who looked out for me.

00:23:02.830 --> 00:23:06.100
But I was still deaf
in this hospital room.

00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:11.060
The head of all of NASA, Daniel
Goldin, came to visit me.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:16.810
And these legal pads are my way
of communicating with the world.

00:23:16.810 --> 00:23:19.660
I could talk, but I would have

00:23:19.660 --> 00:23:22.720
to hear what they say
through this writing.

00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:24.370
He said I am not going to give
up on you like we did not give

00:23:24.370 --> 00:23:26.190
up on the Hubble Space Telescope.

00:23:26.190 --> 00:23:29.730
It needed corrective
vision when it was launched.

00:23:29.730 --> 00:23:33.370
And he wrote me this long letter

00:23:33.370 --> 00:23:38.170
about the Hubble's first image it
took was this eagle's nest nebula

00:23:38.170 --> 00:23:41.640
seven thousand light years from
Earth, one light year in length,

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:43.930
the place where stars are born.

00:23:43.930 --> 00:23:46.050
He gave me his cell phone number.

00:23:46.050 --> 00:23:50.180
He said I will never give up on
you, I will never give up on you.

00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.760
And then three months
later he was fired

00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:55.660
and I am like, oh man [laughter].

00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.190
That cell phone is no
longer any good, you know.

00:23:59.190 --> 00:24:02.480
But you know my hearing did come
back and they were trying to figure

00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:06.010
out what to do with me as a you
know hearing impaired astronaut.

00:24:06.010 --> 00:24:08.680
So I came up to Washington
D.C. to work in education.

00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:10.340
And we started this program

00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:13.000
in 2003 called the
Educator Astronaut Program,

00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:14.720
where we were going to hire,

00:24:14.720 --> 00:24:18.080
let students nominate their
teachers to become astronauts.

00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.050
And we actually hired three
teachers that have flown in space.

00:24:22.050 --> 00:24:24.550
And done space walks and
done all these things.

00:24:24.550 --> 00:24:28.110
But I was not going to fly because
I was medically disqualified.

00:24:28.110 --> 00:24:31.050
And around that same
time, February 1st, 2003,

00:24:31.050 --> 00:24:32.840
we lost Space Shuttle Columbia.

00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:35.640
Many of you remember this.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:41.080 position:56%
And you know exactly where you were
when it broke up over the Texas sky.

00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:45.070
I went to David Brown, who is the
gentleman in the top left corner.

00:24:45.070 --> 00:24:47.180
He was a military test pilot.

00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:48.480
He was a medical doctor.

00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:52.000
He was the doctor that was
actually doing the investigation

00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.010
on me for my hearing.

00:24:55.010 --> 00:24:57.040
And he perished.

00:24:57.040 --> 00:25:02.860
We were going to have, do a photo
shoot when he got back home.

00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.760
He never made it back.

00:25:04.760 --> 00:25:08.500
In the bottom left corner,
that is David's father

00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.770
at Arlington National Cemetery.

00:25:10.770 --> 00:25:15.390
We went around the country to
the different memorial services.

00:25:15.390 --> 00:25:19.030
We are flying in the NASA
jet, taking off and landing.

00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:22.780
And the chief of all the flight
surgeons is sitting beside me

00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.630
on every mission, on every
launch and landing, taking notes.

00:25:26.630 --> 00:25:31.430
When we finished the last memorial
service, he called me in his office

00:25:31.430 --> 00:25:34.440
and he said, Leland
I believe in you.

00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:37.670
Here is a waiver for
you to fly in space.

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:43.350
When I think about this journey
so far, my friends who came

00:25:43.350 --> 00:25:47.950
into that hospital room wrote me
notes saying, you should sue NASA,

00:25:47.950 --> 00:25:51.300
write a book and get
paid [laughter].

00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.600
They hurt you.

00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.910
And they told you, you are
never going to fly in space.

00:25:54.910 --> 00:25:58.230
I believed that that
was not the way to go.

00:25:58.230 --> 00:26:02.000
I believe that there is more to
this journey and to not give up

00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.250
and to have that grit
and perseverance.

00:26:05.250 --> 00:26:07.220
And I signed.

00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.210
I got that waiver.

00:26:09.210 --> 00:26:12.730
I went home to Houston
and said look what I got.

00:26:12.730 --> 00:26:14.980
And this was the picture I took

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.160
when I first got assigned
to my first flight.

00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:19.650 position:56%
They said you can bring your family.

00:26:19.650 --> 00:26:22.840
I said well my family
is in Virginia.

00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.450
But then I thought wait a
minute I have the furry family

00:26:25.450 --> 00:26:28.670
and I snuck them in the back gate.

00:26:28.670 --> 00:26:31.190
I had about a hundred milk bones
that they, when I was putting

00:26:31.190 --> 00:26:33.850
on the orange suit they
were just chomping away.

00:26:33.850 --> 00:26:37.510
And I came out and sat down
and they ran over and Jake came

00:26:37.510 --> 00:26:39.560
up on my ear and was
nibbling my ear.

00:26:39.560 --> 00:26:41.410
Scott was like hey
what are you doing?

00:26:41.410 --> 00:26:44.160
And I told the photographer
shoot the picture!

00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:49.160
So when Harper Collins said, you
know, what picture are we going

00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:50.800
to use for the cover and
I showed him this one

00:26:50.800 --> 00:26:52.160
and he said oh that is the picture.

00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.070
That is the picture.

00:26:54.070 --> 00:26:56.440
So that was right before my launch.

00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.350
Launched in 2008 to the
International Space Station.

00:26:59.350 --> 00:27:00.840
Because I had had the hearing loss,

00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:02.930
they would not let me
get back in the pool.

00:27:02.930 --> 00:27:05.730
So I did robotics instead
of doing space walks.

00:27:05.730 --> 00:27:07.030
This is the launch.

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:08.330
Getting to the Space Station.

00:27:08.330 --> 00:27:09.630
What it looked like getting there.

00:27:09.630 --> 00:27:13.000
We were doing these maneuvers to
take pictures of the underbelly

00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:16.000
so we would not have another
Columbia type activity.

00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.180
And we docked and my job was to
take this Columbus Laboratory,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.300
use the robotic arm to install
it to the Space Station.

00:27:24.300 --> 00:27:25.600
Never done it before.

00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.940
Only in training.

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:30.670
When I got the assignment,
I was in mission control

00:27:30.670 --> 00:27:33.840
and there were probably about
20 German flight controllers.

00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.250
This is the European
Space Agency's Baby.

00:27:36.250 --> 00:27:38.810
They have been waiting 10 years
to get this thing installed.

00:27:38.810 --> 00:27:41.490
So all these flight
controllers are like,

00:27:41.490 --> 00:27:43.360
you know you are installing
our baby, right?

00:27:43.360 --> 00:27:44.660
[Laughter].

00:27:44.660 --> 00:27:47.460
And so they are high fiving
me and chest bumping me,

00:27:47.460 --> 00:27:49.690 position:56%
you know it is like a joyous moment.

00:27:49.690 --> 00:27:52.110
But this one guy as I am walking
out of the room, he turns to me

00:27:52.110 --> 00:27:56.480
and he says, Mr. Melvin we
have been waiting 10 years,

00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.120
do not screw it up.

00:27:58.120 --> 00:28:02.710
So I am taking this thing
out of the [inaudible] bay.

00:28:02.710 --> 00:28:05.520
We are getting it closer
to the Space Station.

00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:07.670
And we are getting it
closer and closer and closer

00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:09.910
and the motion just stops.

00:28:09.910 --> 00:28:13.450
And in the back of my mind I am
like don't screw it up [laughter].

00:28:13.450 --> 00:28:16.440 position:56%
But one little push, one little pull

00:28:16.440 --> 00:28:19.440
on the hand controller
is all it took.

00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:24.620
And Dr. Peggy Whitson, who is
coming home tonight at 9 PM,

00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:27.610
who will be the longest
person in space, 650 days,

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:31.160
who was the longest U.S. person
in space, was my commander

00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:35.520
in my ear saying pull
just a little bit more.

00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.350 position:56%
And I think about those figures
again that have been hidden that are

00:28:39.350 --> 00:28:42.660
in the forefront inspiring
our young girls to be

00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:46.090
and do anything they put their
mind to is such a big part

00:28:46.090 --> 00:28:48.250
of what I try to do also.

00:28:48.250 --> 00:28:50.650
And Peggy invited us over to
dinner in the Russian segment

00:28:50.650 --> 00:28:52.430
and she said you guys bring
the rehydrated vegetables,

00:28:52.430 --> 00:28:54.370
we will have the meat [laughter].

00:28:54.370 --> 00:28:56.380
We have the meats!

00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:59.950
So, we have this meal traveling

00:28:59.950 --> 00:29:02.250
at 17 thousand five
hundred miles per hour.

00:29:02.250 --> 00:29:04.570
Going around the planet
every 90 minutes.

00:29:04.570 --> 00:29:07.830
Seeing a sunrise and a
sunset every 45 minutes.

00:29:07.830 --> 00:29:11.260
Doing it with people we
used to fight against.

00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:13.510
Russians and Germans.

00:29:13.510 --> 00:29:17.060
This is the moment that I went aha.

00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:19.770
I thought all the technical
things that we were doing

00:29:19.770 --> 00:29:21.930
in space were going
to be my aha moment.

00:29:21.930 --> 00:29:26.970
Me saving Europe by installing
their Columbus Laboratory.

00:29:26.970 --> 00:29:28.270
It was not that.

00:29:28.270 --> 00:29:32.990 position:56%
It was this moment of breaking bread
with people going around the planet.

00:29:32.990 --> 00:29:37.660
It is called the overview affect
or the orbital perspective.

00:29:37.660 --> 00:29:42.690
You get this cognitive shift in
your brain that makes you want

00:29:42.690 --> 00:29:44.500
to do better when you come home.

00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:45.800
It makes you.

00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:47.100
15 minutes.

00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:51.460
Okay. So, the Detroit and
Dallas of space [laughter].

00:29:53.490 --> 00:29:57.380
And had this cognitive
shift one more time.

00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:00.610
I think about that is
the outpost that we left

00:30:00.610 --> 00:30:03.130
after doing this work
on the Space Station.

00:30:03.130 --> 00:30:05.300
So are we ready for questions now?

00:30:05.300 --> 00:30:08.590
Or I have 15 minutes before?

00:30:08.590 --> 00:30:09.890
15 minutes are left.

00:30:09.890 --> 00:30:12.900
So give me three more minutes
and then we will get questions.

00:30:12.900 --> 00:30:15.490
You have got to see this view.

00:30:15.490 --> 00:30:18.520
This is playing with
your food in space.

00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.830
But it is also a teaching moment.

00:30:20.830 --> 00:30:23.570
This is surface tension.

00:30:23.570 --> 00:30:25.470
This is chemistry.

00:30:25.470 --> 00:30:27.590
This is physics.

00:30:27.590 --> 00:30:29.940
&gt;&gt; Here this is space food.

00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:31.520
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: I
think about when I talk

00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:36.240
to kids the M&amp;M peanut butter
sandwich to you know tortilla.

00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:40.150
I think about when I talk
to kids about the future

00:30:40.150 --> 00:30:42.030
and what they want to
do with their lives.

00:30:42.030 --> 00:30:43.540
I show them this video.

00:30:43.540 --> 00:30:45.510
And the ones that do not want to
be astronauts, then they want to be

00:30:45.510 --> 00:30:47.510
because you play with
your food in space.

00:30:47.510 --> 00:31:05.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:10.910 position:56%
&gt;&gt; It has to be small enough to be
able to eat in one day, wouldn't it?

00:31:10.910 --> 00:31:12.280
Oh a surface one.

00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:13.580
Look at that.

00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.450
Can we see this surface one?

00:31:16.450 --> 00:31:17.750
Two surface.

00:31:17.750 --> 00:31:24.830
&gt;&gt; Hang on a second
let's get this one.

00:31:24.830 --> 00:31:26.350
Oh sorry dude.

00:31:26.350 --> 00:31:27.650
&gt;&gt; Ohh.

00:31:27.650 --> 00:31:28.950
&gt;&gt; That is going to be [inaudible].

00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:30.250
&gt;&gt; I got it.

00:31:30.250 --> 00:31:31.550
&gt;&gt; Newton's law [inaudible].

00:31:31.550 --> 00:31:32.850
&gt;&gt; It is like croquet or billiards.

00:31:32.850 --> 00:31:34.150
&gt;&gt; Are you ready for separation?

00:31:34.150 --> 00:31:35.450
&gt;&gt; Separate.

00:31:35.450 --> 00:31:36.750
&gt;&gt; Hold on one more.

00:31:36.750 --> 00:31:38.050
&gt;&gt; Ah man.

00:31:38.050 --> 00:31:39.350
&gt;&gt; Dude.

00:31:39.350 --> 00:31:40.650
&gt;&gt; Nice.

00:31:40.650 --> 00:31:41.950
&gt;&gt; Oh nice.

00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:43.830
&gt;&gt; That is going to be a meal, man.

00:31:43.830 --> 00:31:45.130
You got to.

00:31:45.130 --> 00:31:46.430
That is a few sips.

00:31:46.430 --> 00:31:47.730
&gt;&gt; Oh there you go.

00:31:47.730 --> 00:31:49.030
&gt;&gt; Yeah, do not choke on it.

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:50.330
&gt;&gt; Good [inaudible].

00:31:50.330 --> 00:31:51.630
&gt;&gt; Go for it L dog.

00:31:51.630 --> 00:31:52.930
&gt;&gt; You got it.

00:31:52.930 --> 00:31:54.980
Wow almost on the lens.

00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:59.550
&gt;&gt; It is a little hotter
than you think.

00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.080
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: I
get to space safely,

00:32:03.080 --> 00:32:06.580
install the Columbus
Laboratory and almost choke

00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:09.080
on a water bubble and
die [laughter].

00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:10.380
My mother saw this video.

00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:12.200
She was going to kill me.

00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:13.500
Another hand in my development.

00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:15.340
But anyway, I want
to take questions now

00:32:15.340 --> 00:32:17.710
because we only have a
little bit of time left.

00:32:17.710 --> 00:32:19.280
And we can talk about
some of the other slides,

00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.580 position:56%
maybe through some of the questions.

00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:25.510
So, thank you so much for your time
and attention and your literacy.

00:32:25.510 --> 00:32:34.800
[ Applause ]

00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:36.100
Any questions.

00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.360
And if not, we will go
through some more slides.

00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:40.700
Okay. Over here.

00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:42.700
&gt;&gt; Thank you very much
for your talk.

00:32:42.700 --> 00:32:47.940
I was wondering, as someone who is
both an NFL player and a scientist,

00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:49.830
in light of all the
recent literature

00:32:49.830 --> 00:32:52.500
about brain injury with football.

00:32:52.500 --> 00:32:57.010
How has that changed or maybe
not, your support of football

00:32:57.010 --> 00:33:00.500
and whether you encourage
and/or discourage young people

00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:01.800
from playing the sport?

00:33:01.800 --> 00:33:03.880
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: That
is a very good question.

00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.120
I never had a concussion.

00:33:07.120 --> 00:33:09.210
I never. I was always able to kind

00:33:09.210 --> 00:33:11.470
of like deflect the
blow and get away.

00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:14.640
And I did not really spear
as a child, you know.

00:33:14.640 --> 00:33:18.310
I am concerned about
what is happening.

00:33:18.310 --> 00:33:21.630
I know John Urschel, who played
with the Ravens, is getting his PhD

00:33:21.630 --> 00:33:26.340
at MIT and he realized that during
his play he cannot do math the same

00:33:26.340 --> 00:33:28.630
way that he was doing before.

00:33:28.630 --> 00:33:31.540
I know the NFL is this
money making machine

00:33:31.540 --> 00:33:35.470
and all these things and I am torn.

00:33:35.470 --> 00:33:36.770
You know, I love football.

00:33:36.770 --> 00:33:38.070
I love playing.

00:33:38.070 --> 00:33:41.660 position:56%
I love the competition and all those
things, but we have to think first

00:33:41.660 --> 00:33:46.290
of the importance of having
a functioning solid brain

00:33:46.290 --> 00:33:49.760
to do other things like
education and so forth.

00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:55.640 position:56%
So I am kind of torn because it was
something that I did for a long time

00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:57.700
in my life and I was
passionate about it.

00:33:57.700 --> 00:34:02.290 position:56%
But at the same time, there are more
important things like communicating

00:34:02.290 --> 00:34:05.010
with your children and
inspiring the next generation.

00:34:05.010 --> 00:34:08.300
And if you cannot do that
because you are impaired

00:34:08.300 --> 00:34:11.730 position:56%
in some way, it is not a good thing.

00:34:11.730 --> 00:34:13.370
Okay. Good question.

00:34:13.370 --> 00:34:17.440
This one and then come on
up to the mic, right here.

00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.740
I like your shirt.

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.040
&gt;&gt; So for the record.

00:34:20.040 --> 00:34:21.340
Oh thanks.

00:34:21.340 --> 00:34:22.640
It was intentional.

00:34:22.640 --> 00:34:23.940
I definitely had it in mind.

00:34:23.940 --> 00:34:25.240
For the record, I am
a diver and I am one

00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:28.660
of those people who can just go.

00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:35.010
Yep that is all it takes.

00:34:35.010 --> 00:34:36.890
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: Show
off [laughter].

00:34:36.890 --> 00:34:38.680
&gt;&gt; But I. When.

00:34:38.680 --> 00:34:41.750
I have always been a really
big, I say space nerd.

00:34:41.750 --> 00:34:45.940
But I was in a science class
my freshman year of college

00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:48.350
and I was told by a TA that
I ask too many questions

00:34:48.350 --> 00:34:51.060
and I would never succeed
in college science.

00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:55.250
And I graduated with a
degree in political science

00:34:55.250 --> 00:34:59.100
and I taught myself the
physics of space time

00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:02.280
so that I can explain
gravitational waves.

00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:05.070
But I have a BA in
political science.

00:35:05.070 --> 00:35:08.340
How do I get back into.

00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:11.860
How does somebody who ends up
out of the sciences or whatever,

00:35:11.860 --> 00:35:13.870
get back into that as a career?

00:35:13.870 --> 00:35:16.450 position:56%
Whether that is going back to school

00:35:16.450 --> 00:35:20.880 position:56%
or are there other professional
opportunities within an organization

00:35:20.880 --> 00:35:23.650
like NASA for somebody like me.

00:35:23.650 --> 00:35:26.750
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: So last night
I was, I had listened to Reshma

00:35:26.750 --> 00:35:30.060
from Girls that Code, who
has written many books

00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:34.030
about you know empowerment
for women coding.

00:35:34.030 --> 00:35:35.330
And I think about.

00:35:35.330 --> 00:35:38.090
She talked about a young
girl who developed an app

00:35:38.090 --> 00:35:43.380
that was helping people take
SAT's and do these things.

00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:47.010
Most jobs that you get, you are,

00:35:47.010 --> 00:35:50.810
you know your college degree
gets you in that first job.

00:35:50.810 --> 00:35:54.470
The second or third or fourth
job is usually the experience

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:55.890
that you have.

00:35:55.890 --> 00:36:00.090
So, if you go out and use
your self taught, you know,

00:36:00.090 --> 00:36:03.000
knowledge about space and
astronomy and these things,

00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.500
you know to do something that
you can then empower yourself

00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.200
to hire the people in
this particular job.

00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.670
And I think you know it is
really just going for it.

00:36:12.670 --> 00:36:15.260
And you know people that write apps

00:36:15.260 --> 00:36:18.370
and write codes make
considerable amount of money

00:36:18.370 --> 00:36:20.560
with a very small investment
on the front end.

00:36:20.560 --> 00:36:24.550
So, it is figuring out how
to do that with the knowledge

00:36:24.550 --> 00:36:28.080
that you have that someone is
not going to see a transcript

00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.760
or a degree in that
particular field.

00:36:29.760 --> 00:36:31.790
Because the knowledge
is the power, you know.

00:36:31.790 --> 00:36:33.090
It is not the degree.

00:36:33.090 --> 00:36:34.390
The parchment paper means nothing.

00:36:34.390 --> 00:36:36.230
It is what you have in your head.

00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.760
So it is demonstrating to
someone that you have those skills

00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.120 position:56%
that you can do that particular job.

00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.420
&gt;&gt; Thanks.

00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:45.040
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: Yeah.

00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:47.360
[ Applause ]

00:36:47.360 --> 00:36:49.060
&gt;&gt; So you have played in the NFL,

00:36:49.060 --> 00:36:51.590
you have been an astronaut,
you have written a book.

00:36:51.590 --> 00:36:52.900
What is your next big dream?

00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.200
Where do you go from here?

00:36:54.200 --> 00:36:55.500
I would like to hear.

00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.800
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: The
next big dream.

00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.150
I think the biggest dream for me
is to make sure that every kid,

00:37:01.150 --> 00:37:05.620
no matter what zip code in
this country, in the world,

00:37:05.620 --> 00:37:08.830
knows that they can have the
Curious George moment and knows

00:37:08.830 --> 00:37:11.110
that they can have the Little
Engine That Could moment.

00:37:11.110 --> 00:37:13.470
And so I am working with a group
of international astronauts

00:37:13.470 --> 00:37:17.940
to help everyone see this
perspective from space.

00:37:17.940 --> 00:37:20.330
And to have this belief in
themselves that they can do

00:37:20.330 --> 00:37:22.170
or be anything they
put their mind to.

00:37:22.170 --> 00:37:26.190
Zip codes are the things that
are keeping people from access

00:37:26.190 --> 00:37:30.040
to college because of
economic, a number of reasons.

00:37:30.040 --> 00:37:35.170
And the visibility of people like
myself and like Rudy and others,

00:37:35.170 --> 00:37:38.150 position:56%
kids in some communities do not even
know that they can do these things.

00:37:38.150 --> 00:37:40.980
They do not even know about
the opportunities and so

00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:44.120
that is the part to
let Chasing Space

00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:46.560
with the young readers edition, let
them do the experiments in the back

00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.140
of the book and say I am
an engineer like I did

00:37:49.140 --> 00:37:51.220
with my mom's chemistry set.

00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:53.860
And believe that they
can do it and be it.

00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:55.660
That is my mission.

00:37:55.660 --> 00:37:58.550
[ Applause ]

00:37:58.550 --> 00:38:01.000
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: And the
arts are so, such a big.

00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:05.890
So I am a STEAM advocate because
we promote STEM and then people

00:38:05.890 --> 00:38:09.570
that are doing the arts feel like
they are second class citizens.

00:38:09.570 --> 00:38:12.260
But everything we do in science
and technology and engineering

00:38:12.260 --> 00:38:14.360
and mathematics is creativity.

00:38:14.360 --> 00:38:17.800
And when I was in space, Quincy
Jones said to me, he said,

00:38:17.800 --> 00:38:20.530
math and music are the two true
absolutes that use both the right

00:38:20.530 --> 00:38:22.010
and left side of the brain.

00:38:22.010 --> 00:38:24.840
If you know math, you really
know music and vice versa.

00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:27.360
And so we have to tear
down this boundary thing

00:38:27.360 --> 00:38:29.860
of you know you can
be one or the other.

00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:32.550
You can really be all
of what you want to do

00:38:32.550 --> 00:38:34.780
and reinvent yourself
and do anything.

00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:36.580
So. Thank you for teaching
by the way.

00:38:36.580 --> 00:38:38.740
[Applause].

00:38:38.740 --> 00:38:40.040
Yes sir?

00:38:40.040 --> 00:38:43.810
&gt;&gt; What was your favorite
thing about going to space?

00:38:43.810 --> 00:38:46.540
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: The favorite
thing about going to space.

00:38:46.540 --> 00:38:47.910
It was not the bathroom,
okay [laughter].

00:38:47.910 --> 00:38:52.470
And I have a story about
that later if you want to.

00:38:52.470 --> 00:38:55.290
It is really hard to go
to the bathroom in space.

00:38:55.290 --> 00:38:58.740
I think the favorite thing
was looking out the window

00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:03.290
with my colleagues that I was
work-in with from around the world

00:39:03.290 --> 00:39:06.970
and to fly over Lynchburg,
Virginia, my hometown,

00:39:06.970 --> 00:39:10.600
and think about my parents and
family having a meal down there.

00:39:10.600 --> 00:39:11.900
Five minutes.

00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.300
Okay. Having a meal down there and
then seven minutes later we are

00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:20.040
over Paris and Leo is
looking down thinking

00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:21.660
about his family having a meal.

00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.010
And Yuri is looking off to Russia.

00:39:24.010 --> 00:39:29.730
So we are all experiencing seeing
our hometowns from space in a very,

00:39:29.730 --> 00:39:31.620
very short period of time.

00:39:31.620 --> 00:39:34.310 position:56%
And then a little bit later you are
back around the planet and if I were

00:39:34.310 --> 00:39:37.220
in Virginia, I am not in
Tennessee and I am stepping

00:39:37.220 --> 00:39:41.460
across the United States in
this very short period of time.

00:39:41.460 --> 00:39:42.800 position:56%
And then also playing with your food

00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:45.260
in space is really
cool too [laughter].

00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.560
Good question.

00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:47.860
Thank you.

00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:49.160
Yes sir?

00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:54.130
&gt;&gt; So I want to be one of the
next astronauts to go to Mars.

00:39:54.130 --> 00:39:55.430
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: Okay.

00:39:55.430 --> 00:40:00.250
&gt;&gt; And I have gotten into all
GT classes and such and such.

00:40:00.250 --> 00:40:03.820
And tried my best with
all that I can do.

00:40:03.820 --> 00:40:07.040
What was your motivation?

00:40:07.040 --> 00:40:09.410
What kept you going?

00:40:09.410 --> 00:40:10.960
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: What
kept me going?

00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:14.000
I think. I mean, again
getting back to.

00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:16.450
Have you read The Little
Engine That Could?

00:40:16.450 --> 00:40:18.150
&gt;&gt; Yes, as well as Curious George.

00:40:18.150 --> 00:40:21.510
I have been watching those
ever since I was little.

00:40:21.510 --> 00:40:23.020
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: You have
not read Curious George?

00:40:23.020 --> 00:40:25.210
Not yet. I am telling you over.

00:40:25.210 --> 00:40:28.250
There is something called
the joy of repetition.

00:40:28.250 --> 00:40:31.150
When you have heard
it so many times,

00:40:31.150 --> 00:40:33.620
you already believed
that you can do it.

00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:38.370
And my motivation was again
having people that believed in my

00:40:38.370 --> 00:40:40.000
when I did not believe in myself.

00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.780
But you have to build
that internal strength

00:40:42.780 --> 00:40:44.970
and character and discipline.

00:40:44.970 --> 00:40:46.270
That if you fail.

00:40:46.270 --> 00:40:48.480
And there is nothing
wrong with failing.

00:40:48.480 --> 00:40:50.680
I failed at many things.

00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:52.960
It is not that you fail.

00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:55.190
It is that you pick
yourself up after the failure

00:40:55.190 --> 00:40:56.850
and figure out what was wrong.

00:40:56.850 --> 00:41:00.990
We built rockets that failed many
times before we got one right

00:41:00.990 --> 00:41:02.560
to get to the Moon.

00:41:02.560 --> 00:41:04.200
So keep going.

00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:05.500
Just keep going.

00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:06.800
Just believe.

00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:11.140 position:56%
And find that person that has your
back and wants you to be successful.

00:41:11.140 --> 00:41:15.390
And grab them and say I
want to be on Mars in 20.

00:41:15.390 --> 00:41:16.690
What how old are you?

00:41:16.690 --> 00:41:17.990
&gt;&gt; I am 12.

00:41:17.990 --> 00:41:19.350
So 2030, 2040.

00:41:19.350 --> 00:41:20.650
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: Okay 2040.

00:41:20.650 --> 00:41:22.910
I want to be on Mars in 2040.

00:41:22.910 --> 00:41:25.490
Email Elon Musk [laughter].

00:41:25.490 --> 00:41:28.880
Seriously, Elon Musk on Instagram.

00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:32.730
Say, Elon, hey I want to go to
Mars on the Falcon Heavy baby.

00:41:32.730 --> 00:41:34.530
Come one. Help me.

00:41:34.530 --> 00:41:36.470
Help me. You know.

00:41:36.470 --> 00:41:39.560
I mean reach out to people
that are doing the things

00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.910
that you want to do.

00:41:40.910 --> 00:41:42.210
Reach out to me.

00:41:42.210 --> 00:41:43.510
I am on Instagram.

00:41:43.510 --> 00:41:44.810
Leland Melvin.

00:41:44.810 --> 00:41:46.610
You know and we will
have the discussion.

00:41:46.610 --> 00:41:50.810
And if you get to a road block,
we can overcome that road block.

00:41:50.810 --> 00:41:52.320
You can get through it.

00:41:52.320 --> 00:41:53.620
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:54.920
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: I cannot wait
to see you up there [applause].

00:41:54.920 --> 00:41:59.450
We are out.

00:41:59.450 --> 00:42:01.130
Two minutes.

00:42:01.130 --> 00:42:02.810
Okay. I am going to get to.

00:42:02.810 --> 00:42:04.110
Okay. Go ahead.

00:42:04.110 --> 00:42:07.640
&gt;&gt; Hi. I really enjoyed
reading the part of your book

00:42:07.640 --> 00:42:08.940
where you were talking

00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:10.440
about Nichelle Nichols
and her work with NASA.

00:42:10.440 --> 00:42:12.370
I had no idea.

00:42:12.370 --> 00:42:15.980
So, I would like to know your
thoughts about women in STEM.

00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.740
There is a group of STEM
students right here.

00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:20.040
One of them is my daughter,

00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:22.390
who is starting the STEM
program in three days.

00:42:22.390 --> 00:42:24.370
My son is about to
start his third year.

00:42:24.370 --> 00:42:27.010 position:56%
So, I just like your thoughts on it.

00:42:27.010 --> 00:42:29.470 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: So women in STEAM,
I think is what you said, right?

00:42:29.470 --> 00:42:32.990
Women in STEAM?

00:42:32.990 --> 00:42:35.950
There is a group called Makers.

00:42:35.950 --> 00:42:37.700
Makers.com.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:39.000
I want you to go to the website.

00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.290
Send all your girls to the
website and this is a place

00:42:42.290 --> 00:42:45.390
that showcases women
doing incredible things.

00:42:45.390 --> 00:42:47.900
Peggy Whitson is a Maker woman.

00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:50.610
And they see their
path, their journey.

00:42:50.610 --> 00:42:56.280
I think about Peggy and her
dream was to be an astronaut.

00:42:56.280 --> 00:42:57.580
Not a goal.

00:42:57.580 --> 00:42:58.880
It was a dream.

00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.260
And when Sally Ride became
the first female astronaut,

00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:05.190
her dream changed to a goal.

00:43:05.190 --> 00:43:08.660
She applied 13 times.

00:43:08.660 --> 00:43:09.960
She had a medical condition

00:43:09.960 --> 00:43:11.410
where they said you
cannot be an astronaut.

00:43:11.410 --> 00:43:12.900
She did the research
and found out that

00:43:12.900 --> 00:43:15.650
that is not a problem
for me to go to space.

00:43:15.650 --> 00:43:18.080
So 12 times she was denied.

00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:22.630
And tonight she comes home
as the first U.S. person

00:43:22.630 --> 00:43:25.310
to have 650 days in space.

00:43:25.310 --> 00:43:26.680
So, it is the tenacity.

00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:29.710 position:56%
It is the I think I can and believe.

00:43:29.710 --> 00:43:31.970
And I say, ladies you
can do anything

00:43:31.970 --> 00:43:34.610
that these knucklehead guys can do.

00:43:34.610 --> 00:43:36.790
Okay. Seriously.

00:43:36.790 --> 00:43:39.280
And I am a Maker man
that supports women.

00:43:39.280 --> 00:43:42.640
So, it is just so important
that we do that.

00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:45.210 position:56%
And some of my bosses have been some

00:43:45.210 --> 00:43:47.200
of the most incredibly
talented and beautiful.

00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:49.440
I mean, I think of
Katherine Johnson.

00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:53.260
I was at her birthday party in
West Virginia this past weekend.

00:43:53.260 --> 00:43:55.460
She turned 99 years old.

00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:58.750
And I think about her
calculations that helped me get

00:43:58.750 --> 00:44:00.750
to space on the space shuttle.

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:04.990
Not just John, you know John
Glen, but the rest of our program.

00:44:04.990 --> 00:44:07.550
So, girls, ladies do it.

00:44:07.550 --> 00:44:08.850
Do it! [Applause].

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:11.580
And do not be shy like
our other friend,

00:44:11.580 --> 00:44:15.760
our other NASA friend in here.

00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:18.180
Do not be shy.

00:44:18.180 --> 00:44:21.230
If a guy tells you that you know
you should be playing dolls,

00:44:21.230 --> 00:44:24.490
you should be doing
something else -- show them.

00:44:24.490 --> 00:44:25.790
Beat them.

00:44:25.790 --> 00:44:27.540
Let the [inaudible] show.

00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:31.260
You know, just do not
be intimidated by that.

00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:32.560
It is crap.

00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:33.920
Yeah. Anyway.

00:44:33.920 --> 00:44:35.220
Wrap it up [laughter].

00:44:35.220 --> 00:44:41.490
Okay. Well one more question
for the young lady right here.

00:44:41.490 --> 00:44:42.800
Okay, go ahead.

00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:46.280
&gt;&gt; If you were going to teach
one thing to kids like me

00:44:46.280 --> 00:44:51.700
and new young generations of
astronauts, what would it be?

00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:56.140
&gt;&gt; Leland Melvin: The one thing
that I would tell you to do is,

00:44:56.140 --> 00:44:57.870
I think Mark Twain said it.

00:44:57.870 --> 00:45:00.510
The two most important days of
your life are the day you were born

00:45:00.510 --> 00:45:02.450
and the day you figure out why.

00:45:02.450 --> 00:45:07.010
Study, learn, figure out
why you exist on this planet

00:45:07.010 --> 00:45:08.400
and what your purpose is.

00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:11.180
To help other people and
advance our civilization.

00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:14.030
And once you figure
that out, it is fun.

00:45:14.030 --> 00:45:15.430
Alright. Thank you so much.

00:45:15.430 --> 00:45:18.430
Have a great day.

00:45:18.430 --> 00:45:20.230
Chasing Space.

00:45:20.230 --> 00:45:23.600
[Applause].

00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.470
