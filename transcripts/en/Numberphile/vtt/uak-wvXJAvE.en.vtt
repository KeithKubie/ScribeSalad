BRADY HARAN: So here's a video
a lot of you specifically

00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:03.400
asked me to make.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:05.200
First of all, here's
the background.

00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:08.630
A few weeks ago, I made this
video with my neighbors, Danny

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:12.170
and Emily, all about numbers
in a tin of spaghetti.

00:00:12.170 --> 00:00:16.540
At the end of the video, I
offered them 4 pounds each.

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:19.020
This is what 4 pounds
looks like.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:23.050
Or I offered to put this piece
of paper on eBay and give the

00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:24.230
proceeds to them.

00:00:24.230 --> 00:00:26.250
DANNY: I reckon eBay.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:27.664
EMILY: We should go for eBay?

00:00:27.664 --> 00:00:28.086
DANNY: Yeah.

00:00:28.086 --> 00:00:28.930
EMILY: OK, yeah.

00:00:28.930 --> 00:00:30.980
BRADY HARAN: And the winning
bid, which came from this chap

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:32.830
in Australia, was--

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:35.350
well, somewhat more than
4 pounds each.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:38.400
Now, those of you who followed
the auction desperately wanted

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.810
to see the reaction when
the kids got the money.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:46.660
So this is what 550 pounds looks
like in one-pound coins.

00:00:46.660 --> 00:00:49.490
EBay obviously have taken
their share of things.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:51.340
And here is that reaction
you wanted to see.

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:05.938
BRADY HARAN: They're all
one-pound coins.

00:01:05.938 --> 00:01:07.910
BRADY HARAN: I don't know.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.765
How much do you think
is there?

00:01:11.765 --> 00:01:13.015
BRADY HARAN: That's all yours.

00:01:16.830 --> 00:01:19.310
So what would you do if you were
10 and 13 years old and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:21.540
got given all that money?

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.830
Have a think about it.

00:01:23.830 --> 00:01:24.670
DANNY: Thanks for that.

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:25.860
EMILY: Thank you.

00:01:25.860 --> 00:01:27.460
BRADY HARAN: I've actually got
a note here from Danny and

00:01:27.460 --> 00:01:29.280
Emily, who have thought
about it.

00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:30.910
And this is what they
spent it on--

00:01:30.910 --> 00:01:33.940
a couple of treats for
themselves; a present for

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:37.650
their sister, who wasn't able to
be involved in the filming;

00:01:37.650 --> 00:01:39.980
taking the whole family,
including their mom and dad,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:43.810
out for a family meal; and
sponsoring a toilet in a third

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:46.110
world country through
this scheme.

00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:47.910
So they're giving a fair
portion of what

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:49.920
they made to charity.

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:52.140
And that's not where the
story ends, actually.

00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:55.030
The people from Heinz, who make
the Numberetti, they were

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.950
fascinated by the video.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:00.250
They actually sent a couple
of gift packs to the kids.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.050
But they also sent all these
tins of baked beans.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.210
Danny and Emily's father
actually works for a local

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:08.990
charity here in Nottingham
helping people in times of

00:02:08.990 --> 00:02:12.020
need with furniture and food
and things like that, and

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.540
these baked beans are going
to go to those people.

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:18.750
I think making YouTube videos
is really fun and we do all

00:02:18.750 --> 00:02:21.680
sorts of crazy things that you
get to watch like going into

00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.070
gold bullion vaults and
rolling Yahtzees and

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:27.780
blowing things up.

00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:28.920
-Whoa!

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:30.580
BRADY HARAN: And I don't think
it's that often we think about

00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:33.860
the serious things in life and
people who are maybe less

00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:35.580
fortunate than us.

00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.610
This is probably a good time of
year to think about it, and

00:02:37.610 --> 00:02:39.110
this is probably also a
good video in which

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.390
to think about it.

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:44.550
So under this video, I'm going
to put some links to charities

00:02:44.550 --> 00:02:46.500
and things like that that
maybe you want to make a

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.600
contribution to.

00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:51.590
This year, in particular, my
life, through the people I

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.460
work with and also family and
friends, has been affected

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:58.750
quite a lot by cancer.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:01.740
And I guess cancer research is
something that I think is

00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:02.680
really important.

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:06.230
So I've actually set up a
Numberphile page, a JustGiving

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:08.960
page, where you can give money
towards cancer research.

00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:12.210
And if that's something that
affects you, or you can't

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.990
think of anything but
want to contribute,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:15.100
that link is below.

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:17.160
I'll include the toilet
charity that Danny

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:18.090
and Emily gave to.

00:03:18.090 --> 00:03:19.890
If you send in some suggestions,
maybe I'll try

00:03:19.890 --> 00:03:21.140
and include some
others as well.

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:22.920
But it's just something
to think about.

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.930
And thanks for all your support
for Numberphile, and

00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:27.780
thanks for everyone who
bid on that piece of

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:28.560
paper for the kids.

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.570
It was a lot of fun,
and we'll have more

00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:31.820
Numberphile videos soon.
