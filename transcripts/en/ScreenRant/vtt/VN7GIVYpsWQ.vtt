00:00:10.219 --> 00:00:14.919
The days of television being seen as the smaller,
cheaper version of films is long over, with

00:00:14.919 --> 00:00:18.990
some of the best TV shows and their rabid
fan bases putting blockbuster movies to shame.

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:22.320
But when the people behind the scenes of a
TV show are just as dedicated to big screen

00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:25.730
properties and storytellers as any other fan,
some awesome easter eggs or references can

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:26.730
be snuck in.

00:00:26.730 --> 00:00:30.110
Here are Screenrant’s 10 Movies Hidden in
Popular TV Shows.

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.110
Breaking Bad

00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:35.309
The series creator Vince Gilligan never denied
any claims that he was a fan of Quentin Tarantino,

00:00:35.309 --> 00:00:37.980
so fans were looking for influences from the
first episode.

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.829
It didn’t take long, either.

00:00:39.829 --> 00:00:43.700
The main characters, Walter White and Jesse
Pinkman were seen as an obvious riff on two

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:47.970
stars of the movie Reservoir Dogs: Harvey
Keitel’s ‘Mr. White’ and Steve Buscemi’s

00:00:47.970 --> 00:00:48.970
‘Mr. Pink.’

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:52.610
It took four seasons for the similarity to
pay off, when Jesse and Walt wind up coming

00:00:52.610 --> 00:00:57.970
to blows, recreating the famous scene between
their Reservoir counterparts.

00:00:57.970 --> 00:00:58.970
Firefly

00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:02.320
Even if the actual science behind freezing
somebody in “carbonite” was never really

00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:06.380
explained, there’s one thing we DO know:
when George Lucas had Han Solo frozen in a

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:10.220
block of the substance in The Empire Strikes
Back, he created one iconic prop.

00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:13.280
Joss Whedon was more than a casual fan of
the galaxy far, far away, and found a clever

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:16.240
means of showing his love when making his
own space adventure, Firefly.

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:20.350
The presence of a miniature Han in the crew’s
quarters may break the fiction, but the model

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:25.640
can apparently be spotted in every episode,
for those fans who manage to spot it.

00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:27.380
Star Wars: The Clone Wars

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:31.250
The animated series set between the second
and third Star Wars films covered a lot of

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:34.710
ground, but they found time to squeeze in
some easter eggs for director George Lucas

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:35.710
along the way.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:39.670
When Asoka does battle with a group of kidnappers
hunting their victims for sport, viewers can

00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:43.500
spot one of the infamous crystal skulls from
the fourth Indiana Jones movie.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:47.850
But for Star Wars fans who prefer the archaeologist’s
early adventures, another episode also saw

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:52.000
Separatists looting an alien stronghold, with
an unmistakable Ark of the Covenant, lifted

00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:53.640
directly from Raiders, among the treasures.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:55.659
Game of Thrones

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:58.810
When the mother of dragons marches on the
city of Meereen in the fourth season of Game

00:01:58.810 --> 00:02:01.590
of Thrones, an unforgettable fight takes place.

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.170
But before soldiers clash steel, one of the
city’s soldiers emerges to insult the would-be

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:08.700
queen using some choice language.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:19.560
Except the translation offered isn’t totally
accurate.

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.380
Once the scene aired, the show’s linguist,
responsible for creating the fictional languages,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.060
was bombarded by fans asking if they had misheard.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:35.950
But they hadn’t: the speech is lifted word
for word from Monty Python and the Holy Grail.

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:40.230
Unlike the medieval comedy, the soldier gets
what he has coming almost immediately.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:41.800
The New Batman Adventures

00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:45.459
Batman fans will always remember Joel Schumacher
as the director who took the superhero’s

00:02:45.459 --> 00:02:49.264
films from cool to crazy, adding nipples on
the Batsuit, and turning the Batmobile into

00:02:49.264 --> 00:02:50.340
a glowing eyesore.

00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.340
Batman’s animated universe stayed far more
faithful, and apparently, the writers behind

00:02:54.340 --> 00:02:57.070
Batman’s New Adventures weren’t thrilled
with Schumacher’s version either.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:03:01.349
One episode of the series brings each of Batman’s
comic identities to life as a group of kids

00:03:01.349 --> 00:03:03.010
disagree over the stories they’ve heard.

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:06.690
Once versions of the 1960s TV show and Frank
Miller’s Dark Knight Returns are played

00:03:06.690 --> 00:03:08.680
out, another kid gives his own pitch.

00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:14.000
The flamboyant boy’s description of Batman
is a playful shot at the later films, with

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:21.640
the “Shoe Maker” sign driving the point
home.

00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.319
Who says the company can’t laugh at itself?

00:03:25.319 --> 00:03:26.319
Breaking Bad

00:03:26.319 --> 00:03:29.300
Tarantino wasn’t the only director Vince
Gilligan referenced in his hit series, since

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.840
the New Mexico setting of Breaking Bad couldn’t
help but take the creator back to his love

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:33.840
of westerns.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:35.540
Specifically, the films of director Budd Boetticher.

00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:40.050
So when it came time to introduce a replacement
for Jesse, Gilligan named the karaoke-loving

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:41.750
cooker after his inspiration.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:45.110
Gale Boetticher didn’t get a very happy
ending, but at least his origins came from

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:46.459
a happy place.

00:03:46.459 --> 00:03:47.901
Use stills for the westerns.

00:03:47.901 --> 00:03:48.901
The Walking Dead

00:03:48.901 --> 00:03:52.920
The zombies of this AMC series owe plenty
of thanks to special effects wizard Greg Nicotero,

00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:56.140
whose role behind the scenes has only grown
since the show debuted.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:04:00.260
That doesn’t just mean easter eggs or references
to classic zombie films like George Romero’s

00:04:00.260 --> 00:04:03.780
Dawn of the Dead, but nods to classic horror
in every shape and size.

00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:07.129
Take, for instance, the season 5 premiere,
when Rick and the gang pick their way through

00:04:07.129 --> 00:04:08.569
a collection of wooden crates.

00:04:08.569 --> 00:04:12.840
Take a closer look at one crate, and its mailing
information is crystal clear: “SHIP TO HORLICKS

00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:14.620
UNIVERSITY, VIA JULIA CARPENTER.”

00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:17.699
To find out what’s in the box, viewers just
need to re-watch Romero’s Creepshow, where

00:04:17.699 --> 00:04:18.739
it first appeared.

00:04:18.739 --> 00:04:22.379
But they may regret that they did.

00:04:22.379 --> 00:04:23.379
Arrested Development

00:04:23.379 --> 00:04:27.440
Fans will never forget that odd disguises
or surprise reveals of Gene Parmesan, the

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.490
Bluth family’s go-to private investigator.

00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.740
But when Arrested Development took to Netflix
for season 4, they crafted another weird joke

00:04:33.740 --> 00:04:35.300
around actor Martin Mull.

00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.940
Throughout the season, the family members
took to eating a unique dish, mixing parmesan

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.880
cheese with plain old yellow mustard.

00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:44.810
Nobody seems to enjoy it, but they might once
they get the joke.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:49.410
Martin Mull may be best known for his TV roles,
but he also appeared in the big screen version

00:04:49.410 --> 00:04:51.250
of Clue, based on the board game.

00:04:51.250 --> 00:04:52.250
What role?

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:53.250
Colonel Mustard.

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.890
The show goes a step farther, having him pick
up a knife next to a ballroom, in case the

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.090
joke passed anyone by.

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.090
Supernatural

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:05.430
The CW series is known for its meta and self-referential
episodes, including one in which the Winchester

00:05:05.430 --> 00:05:09.260
Brothers travelled to an alternate world where
their life was a strange TV show.

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:11.990
But the nods to horror movies are where the
real gold can be found, so when the brothers

00:05:11.990 --> 00:05:15.370
investigated a haunted movie set, the writers
went all out.

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:22.900
For starters, acknowledging real-world WB
horror movies.

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:30.300
But the best reference was to a horror movie
that’s… not exactly a classic: Boogeyman.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:36.940
Taking a shot at the Emily Deschanel and Lucy
Lawless movie about a monster in the closet

00:05:36.940 --> 00:05:41.330
is harmless – until you realize that it’s
“terrible script” was written by Eric

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:44.470
Kripke, the creator and writer of Supernatural.

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:48.290
Unsurprisingly, he didn’t write the script
for this episode.

00:05:48.290 --> 00:05:49.290
House of Cards

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:53.110
In the world of finicky, ruthless directors,
David Fincher is on his own level.

00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:57.990
You can’t argue with his results, having
delivered movies like Se7en, Gone Girl and

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.150
Fight Club, but his movie career got off to
a terrible start.

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:05.139
His first film, Alien 3 was a disaster behind
the scenes, and Fincher’s demands of his

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.100
cast and crew only made things worse.

00:06:07.100 --> 00:06:10.729
Years later he would tell a story of one line
producer who told him to go easier on those

00:06:10.729 --> 00:06:13.039
around him, and try to be more of a people
person.

00:06:13.039 --> 00:06:16.770
He replied by saying that he loved people,
but hinted that he saw them as things to be

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:17.770
managed.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.290
The words were so chilling to writer Beau
Willimon, that when it came time to write

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.270
the script for the Netflix series – which
Fincher would direct and produce – he put

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:31.990
the director’s exact words into the mouth
of its calculating main character, Frank Underwood.

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:35.610
Apparently movie-making and politics aren’t
so different after all.

00:06:35.610 --> 00:06:37.199
