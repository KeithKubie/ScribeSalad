the history of borrowing borrowed words
 

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:27.830
the history of borrowing borrowed words
are called loan words or loans borrowing

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:27.840
are called loan words or loans borrowing

are called loan words or loans borrowing
into that particular language and in

source languages that were the source of
the borrowings underwent notice that

the borrowings underwent notice that
 

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:39.350
the borrowings underwent notice that
words are often borrowed or inherited

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:39.360
words are often borrowed or inherited
 

00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:41.359

from non-standard forms of a language
 

00:01:41.369 --> 00:01:43.160
from non-standard forms of a language
and that adds to the complexity

00:01:43.160 --> 00:01:43.170
and that adds to the complexity
 

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:46.100

take for instance medieval Norman French

borrowings into middle English like the

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:48.360
borrowings into middle English like the
 

00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:50.480
borrowings into middle English like the
word chief which is not the same as the

interesting case of dialect mixing which
 

00:01:55.290 --> 00:01:57.230
interesting case of dialect mixing which
accounts for the word pear shirt and

so with those complexities in mind let's

so with those complexities in mind let's
 

00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:04.249
so with those complexities in mind let's
discuss how we trace the path of a word
