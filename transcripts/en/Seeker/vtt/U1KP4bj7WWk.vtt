00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:03.949
We all know that child abuse is terrible and
can have life-long effects on a person.

00:00:03.949 --> 00:00:10.750
But a recent study offers some hope for those
victims who want to start their own family.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:15.579
Hey everyone Julia here for DNews

00:00:15.579 --> 00:00:20.320
According to one study published in JAMA Pediatrics
over 5 million American children suffer from

00:00:20.320 --> 00:00:21.450
some form of maltreatment.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:26.090
To put that statistic in another light, that’s
nearly 1 in 8 American children.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:31.030
Each year over 4,500 kids will wind up in
a hospital for abuse-related injuries.

00:00:31.030 --> 00:00:32.470
That’s really not okay.

00:00:32.470 --> 00:00:36.390
But there’s some good news, a recent study
published in the journal Science found that

00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:37.960
the “cycle of violence” isn’t fate.

00:00:37.960 --> 00:00:42.770
The researchers wanted to see if these abused
children would in turn, abuse their children.

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:46.891
They interviewed hundreds of victims of abuse
in 1989 and followed up with them over the

00:00:46.891 --> 00:00:47.891
years.

00:00:47.891 --> 00:00:50.649
Most of the the victims are now parents themselves.

00:00:50.649 --> 00:00:54.420
Researchers found that people who experienced
childhood abuse were NOT more likely to physically

00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:56.880
abuse their children, which came as a surprise.

00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:00.079
That’s good news for anyone who is concerned
about perpetuating the cycle.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:04.320
However, the subjects were more likely to
neglect or sexually abuse their children.

00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:08.100
And one researcher is concerned that the lower
physical abuse figures were the result of

00:01:08.100 --> 00:01:09.100
reporting.

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.660
Reporting something as “neglect” often
takes less paperwork for Child Protective

00:01:13.660 --> 00:01:16.410
Services and is more effective in getting
a child help.

00:01:16.410 --> 00:01:21.200
I shouldn’t even have to say it, but all
forms of childhood maltreatment are harmful.

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:25.049
People who experienced childhood abuse often
have more problems with substance abuse and

00:01:25.049 --> 00:01:26.330
mental health issues.

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:31.300
The experience can trigger PTSD and can even
change a person’s genes.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:35.150
One study published in Proceedings of the
National Academy of Sciences, Early Edition

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:39.640
found that people who developed PTSD as a
result of their childhood trauma had distinct

00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:43.760
changes in their genes, related to things
like cell death and growth rate regulation.

00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:46.259
It even affected their immune systems.

00:01:46.259 --> 00:01:50.229
The researchers say that “childhood abuse
is embedded in a person’s cells for a long

00:01:50.229 --> 00:01:51.229
time”.

00:01:51.229 --> 00:01:54.950
And it’s not just physical changes, another
study published in Violence and Victims found

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:58.909
that abuse survivors scored lower on ratings
of overall well being.

00:01:58.909 --> 00:02:02.939
Measuring less tangible things like, self-esteem,
self-independence and life satisfaction.

00:02:02.939 --> 00:02:06.540
So it’s good news to hear that “The Cycle
of Abuse” isn’t a guarantee.

00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:10.170
And victims aren’t always subject to the
bad hand fate as dealt them.

00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:13.520
One study published in the Journal of Family
Violence found that marriage and education

00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.660
seemed to temper some of the effects of childhood
maltreatment.

00:02:16.660 --> 00:02:20.390
Being married and/or graduating high school
lowered the risk of depression and alcohol

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:21.390
problems.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:24.310
Decreasing inequality also reduces the likelihood
of abuse.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.050
Some studies, like one by researchers from
Cornell University, suggest a link between

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:29.530
poverty and abuse.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.150
One of the researchers said that “reducing
poverty and inequality would be the single

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:36.140
most effective way to prevent maltreatment
of children”.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.819
While many scientific inquiries of childhood
abuse seem to focus on physical abuse, emotional

00:02:40.819 --> 00:02:42.620
abuse can be just as painful.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:50.780
Tara explains why in this video here.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:58.959
Alright, got any other questions about the
tough stuff?
