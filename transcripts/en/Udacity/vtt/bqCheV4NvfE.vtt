00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.719
This lesson is about the policies and

00:00:02.719 --> 00:00:06.000
programs the US Federal Government
has created

00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:11.540
to encourage the adoption of electronic
records and other health IT tools.

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:12.950
And to provide incentives for

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:16.720
their use in ways that will improve
the quality and efficiency of care.

00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:21.050
Healthcare providers have had
a financial incentive to do

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:25.280
all available tests and
procedures once someone is sick.

00:00:25.280 --> 00:00:27.970
And have had little or no incentive
to keep their patients well.

00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:31.630
Until recently there was
no incentive except for

00:00:31.630 --> 00:00:36.070
special situations like HMOs
that we discussed in lesson one,

00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:41.170
to invest money in health IT systems
that might actually reduce income

00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:45.800
by helping avoid unnecessary or
duplicative tests and procedures.

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:51.700
These incentives are often referred to
as pay for performance, or P for P.

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:56.900
In the typical P for P system, providers
are rewarded for doing tests and

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:01.210
procedures that scientific evidence
suggests are beneficial for

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:04.840
either managing or
preventing chronic disease.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.890
For diabetes this might be an annual
blood test called hemoglobin A1C

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.970
that we'll discuss later on.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:16.130
It might also be screening their
patients for obesity and smoking and

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.090
counseling them to lose weight or quit.
