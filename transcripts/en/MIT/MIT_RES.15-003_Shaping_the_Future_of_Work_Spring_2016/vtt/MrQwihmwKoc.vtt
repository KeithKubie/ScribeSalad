00:00:10.530 --> 00:00:12.880
Education, education, education.

00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:15.540
Some people say that's
the key to success

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.040
in this knowledge-based
economy that we're in.

00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:19.230
And they're right.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:21.980
But the reality is
the education model

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:24.870
that we have inherited
today was built

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:27.940
for the farming economy and
maybe the industrial economy

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:29.320
of the last century.

00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:30.950
And so we're going
to have to adapt

00:00:30.950 --> 00:00:34.540
it to meet the needs of the
next generation workforce.

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.640
And you, as members of the
next generation workforce,

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.030
are going to have to
have your own strategy

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:44.670
for addressing how,
when, where, and how much

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:47.230
over the course of
your life of education

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.480
you are going to invest in.

00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:51.880
Let's start with early
childhood education.

00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:53.390
And I'll start with a story.

00:00:53.390 --> 00:00:54.970
Several months
ago, I was sitting

00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.620
at a lunch with international
students here at MIT.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:00.570
And they were
mid-career students.

00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:03.370
And so I was sitting between
two mothers, one from Portugal

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:04.550
and one from China.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:07.060
And I asked them, when
did your children start

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:09.090
school in your countries?

00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:12.720
And one said, right after
I finished maternity leave.

00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.420
And the other
said, at age three.

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:19.170
They were amazed to hear from
me that basically our children

00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:22.170
in this country start in
kindergarten at age five,

00:01:22.170 --> 00:01:24.760
unless there's some
private alternative.

00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.270
Well, about 70% of the
industrialized world

00:01:28.270 --> 00:01:30.320
starts education earlier.

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.170
So why is this so important?

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:33.940
Well, let's take a look.

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.660
This is Professor James
Heckman from the University

00:01:36.660 --> 00:01:39.440
of Chicago, a Nobel
Prize-winning economist.

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.690
And he is the world's
expert on the economics

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:44.390
of early childhood education.

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:46.360
He has studied this
in experiments,

00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:49.910
he's studied it in Chicago, he's
studied it around the world.

00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:52.810
And what he finds is
that there's a 7% to 10%

00:01:52.810 --> 00:01:57.440
rate of return for society for
every year of early childhood

00:01:57.440 --> 00:01:58.550
education.

00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:02.020
That return is measured not
only in lifetime earnings.

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.550
It's measured in lower
dropout rates, less violence

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:09.500
and less criminal
records, the ability

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.970
to achieve one's objectives
within one's career.

00:02:13.970 --> 00:02:18.620
A whole set of data tell us that
getting children into school

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.790
early is very, very
important to their success.

00:02:22.790 --> 00:02:26.590
Well, it's even more important
for children who are at risk.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.620
Inner city students from
disadvantaged neighborhoods

00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.070
have even higher rates of return
for early childhood education.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.600
So it's very clear
that if we want

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.990
to have the next generation's
children well educated

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.830
so they can move on to achieve
their dreams in the workforce,

00:02:44.830 --> 00:02:46.710
then we have to
get on with this.

00:02:46.710 --> 00:02:50.890
The challenge is that
it's very expensive.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.900
The good news is that mayors
and governors around the country

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:57.060
are beginning to
recognize the importance.

00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:01.380
So from Seattle to New York to
Boston and many other cities,

00:03:01.380 --> 00:03:03.740
we're seeing mayors
take the lead in saying,

00:03:03.740 --> 00:03:07.560
let's figure out how we invest
in early childhood education,

00:03:07.560 --> 00:03:09.690
and let's get on with that task.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.940
For individual parents,
it is very expensive.

00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:16.750
And so we have to work
together as a community

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:19.430
to figure out how we
can fund early childhood

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:21.150
education for all.

00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:23.750
And for every
parent, it's critical

00:03:23.750 --> 00:03:27.510
that you think as
you can about what

00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:29.990
do you need, what do your
children need, what's

00:03:29.990 --> 00:03:34.410
appropriate for different age
groups, from early childhood

00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:39.050
right through elementary
school, what can you afford,

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:42.430
and how can you make it fit
into your work and other family

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.740
responsibilities.

00:03:43.740 --> 00:03:46.530
But if we don't
start early, then we

00:03:46.530 --> 00:04:02.030
will pay the price later.
