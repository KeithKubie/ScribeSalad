retire obviously if they think about it
and they tend to end up with a higher

and they tend to end up with a higher
 

00:15:55.560 --> 00:15:59.180
and they tend to end up with a higher
number which tells me that just that

number which tells me that just that
awareness makes you aware of the reality

00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:01.110
awareness makes you aware of the reality
 

00:16:01.110 --> 00:16:02.780
awareness makes you aware of the reality
that it probably takes more to retire

00:16:02.780 --> 00:16:02.790
that it probably takes more to retire
 

00:16:02.790 --> 00:16:05.180
that it probably takes more to retire
financially than intuitively you might

00:16:05.180 --> 00:16:05.190
financially than intuitively you might
 

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:09.260

00:20:14.750 --> 00:20:14.760
what I talk about our five retirement
 

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:17.240
what I talk about our five retirement
risks and then these other numbers will

00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:17.250
risks and then these other numbers will
 

00:20:17.250 --> 00:20:20.840
risks and then these other numbers will
become obvious as we go through them but

00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:20.850
become obvious as we go through them but
 

00:20:20.850 --> 00:20:23.500
become obvious as we go through them but
the five retirement risks longevity

00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:23.510
the five retirement risks longevity
 

00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:26.750
the five retirement risks longevity
inflation excess withdrawals being too

00:20:26.750 --> 00:20:26.760
inflation excess withdrawals being too
 

00:20:26.760 --> 00:20:28.810
inflation excess withdrawals being too
safe this is that asset allocation

00:20:28.810 --> 00:20:28.820
safe this is that asset allocation
 

00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:30.980
safe this is that asset allocation
conversation and then healthcare risk

00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:30.990
conversation and then healthcare risk
 

00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:36.010
conversation and then healthcare risk
concerns so these are the risks that can

00:20:36.010 --> 00:20:36.020
concerns so these are the risks that can
 

00:20:36.020 --> 00:20:39.020
concerns so these are the risks that can
destroy a retirement plan quite frankly

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:39.030
destroy a retirement plan quite frankly
 

00:20:39.030 --> 00:20:43.640
destroy a retirement plan quite frankly
even if you plan for it but awareness of

00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:43.650
even if you plan for it but awareness of
 

00:20:43.650 --> 00:20:47.870
even if you plan for it but awareness of
what these risks can mean can set you up

00:20:47.870 --> 00:20:47.880
what these risks can mean can set you up
 

00:20:47.880 --> 00:20:50.780
what these risks can mean can set you up
to be able to avoid some of least the

00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:50.790
to be able to avoid some of least the
 

00:20:50.790 --> 00:20:55.810
to be able to avoid some of least the
obvious mistakes longevity for I'm sorry

00:20:55.810 --> 00:20:55.820
obvious mistakes longevity for I'm sorry
 

00:20:55.820 --> 00:20:59.030
obvious mistakes longevity for I'm sorry
no I was just saying considering the

00:20:59.030 --> 00:20:59.040
no I was just saying considering the
 

00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:01.490
no I was just saying considering the
implication of these risks can set you

00:21:01.490 --> 00:21:01.500
implication of these risks can set you
 

00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.860
implication of these risks can set you
up for at least avoiding the avoidable

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:03.870
up for at least avoiding the avoidable
 

00:21:03.870 --> 00:21:09.100
up for at least avoiding the avoidable
portion of the wrist but oh sure

00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:09.110
portion of the wrist but oh sure
 

00:21:09.110 --> 00:21:12.950
portion of the wrist but oh sure
longevity inflation excess withdrawals

00:21:12.950 --> 00:21:12.960
longevity inflation excess withdrawals
 

00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:15.500
longevity inflation excess withdrawals
being too safe and health care concerns

00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:15.510
being too safe and health care concerns
 

00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:17.390
being too safe and health care concerns
and we'll go through each one of these

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:17.400
and we'll go through each one of these
 

00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:26.980
and we'll go through each one of these
in order

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:26.990
 
 

00:21:26.990 --> 00:21:29.330
 
holdings in surprise at longevity is

00:21:29.330 --> 00:21:29.340
holdings in surprise at longevity is
 

00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:32.300
holdings in surprise at longevity is
increased but the degree to which it has

00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:32.310
increased but the degree to which it has
 

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:34.640
increased but the degree to which it has
increased has been pretty dramatic and

00:21:34.640 --> 00:21:34.650
increased has been pretty dramatic and
 

00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:35.840
increased has been pretty dramatic and
that there was probably conversation

00:21:35.840 --> 00:21:35.850
that there was probably conversation
 

00:21:35.850 --> 00:21:38.630
that there was probably conversation
about that in the last session what I

00:21:38.630 --> 00:21:38.640
about that in the last session what I
 

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:40.880
about that in the last session what I
like to focus on though is what's that

00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:40.890
like to focus on though is what's that
 

00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.190
like to focus on though is what's that
implication for retirement planning it

00:21:43.190 --> 00:21:43.200
implication for retirement planning it
 

00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:46.610
implication for retirement planning it
used to be you didn't have to plan for a

00:21:46.610 --> 00:21:46.620
used to be you didn't have to plan for a
 

00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:48.770
used to be you didn't have to plan for a
long retirement the lack of longevity

00:21:48.770 --> 00:21:48.780
long retirement the lack of longevity
 

00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:52.060
long retirement the lack of longevity
took care of that for better or worse

00:21:52.060 --> 00:21:52.070
took care of that for better or worse
 

00:21:52.070 --> 00:21:54.530
took care of that for better or worse
but what we're finding now and I'll show

00:21:54.530 --> 00:21:54.540
but what we're finding now and I'll show
 

00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.720
but what we're finding now and I'll show
this to different ways and I'm going to

00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:56.730
this to different ways and I'm going to
 

00:21:56.730 --> 00:21:59.210
this to different ways and I'm going to
I'll jump over to the to the graph

00:21:59.210 --> 00:21:59.220
I'll jump over to the to the graph
 

00:21:59.220 --> 00:22:01.310
I'll jump over to the to the graph
because I think it's easier to see this

00:22:01.310 --> 00:22:01.320
because I think it's easier to see this
 

00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:07.640
because I think it's easier to see this
what this is saying is for a couple if

00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:07.650
what this is saying is for a couple if
 

00:22:07.650 --> 00:22:11.110
what this is saying is for a couple if
you have a man and woman who are both 65

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:11.120
you have a man and woman who are both 65
 

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:14.990
you have a man and woman who are both 65
from an actuarial standpoint these are

00:22:14.990 --> 00:22:15.000
from an actuarial standpoint these are
 

00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:18.140
from an actuarial standpoint these are
the percentages that either the man or

00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:18.150
the percentages that either the man or
 

00:22:18.150 --> 00:22:22.580
the percentages that either the man or
the woman or at least one of them the

00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:22.590
the woman or at least one of them the
 

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:25.400
the woman or at least one of them the
probability that they'll be alive to 72

00:22:25.400 --> 00:22:25.410
probability that they'll be alive to 72
 

00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:34.840
probability that they'll be alive to 72
to these ages here so 80 85 90 95 so

00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:34.850
 
 

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:37.520
 
you've got a twenty-five percent chance

00:22:37.520 --> 00:22:37.530
you've got a twenty-five percent chance
 

00:22:37.530 --> 00:22:40.910
you've got a twenty-five percent chance
that at least one of those 65 year olds

00:22:40.910 --> 00:22:40.920
that at least one of those 65 year olds
 

00:22:40.920 --> 00:22:44.150
that at least one of those 65 year olds
will live to age 96 we didn't have that

00:22:44.150 --> 00:22:44.160
will live to age 96 we didn't have that
 

00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:48.020
will live to age 96 we didn't have that
before that was not a factor that had to

00:22:48.020 --> 00:22:48.030
before that was not a factor that had to
 

00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:50.270
before that was not a factor that had to
be considered from a financial planning

00:22:50.270 --> 00:22:50.280
be considered from a financial planning
 

00:22:50.280 --> 00:22:54.560
be considered from a financial planning
standpoint so for professionals in the

00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:54.570
standpoint so for professionals in the
 

00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.780
standpoint so for professionals in the
planning business the implication is

00:22:56.780 --> 00:22:56.790
planning business the implication is
 

00:22:56.790 --> 00:22:59.990
planning business the implication is
yeah I could say I'm going to build a

00:22:59.990 --> 00:23:00.000
yeah I could say I'm going to build a
 

00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:02.450
yeah I could say I'm going to build a
plan or an expectation to this fifty

00:23:02.450 --> 00:23:02.460
plan or an expectation to this fifty
 

00:23:02.460 --> 00:23:06.560
plan or an expectation to this fifty
percent probability that you know we're

00:23:06.560 --> 00:23:06.570
percent probability that you know we're
 

00:23:06.570 --> 00:23:08.210
percent probability that you know we're
going to live somewhere in the late 80s

00:23:08.210 --> 00:23:08.220
going to live somewhere in the late 80s
 

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.950
going to live somewhere in the late 80s
but the reality is we need to be pushing

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:09.960
but the reality is we need to be pushing
 

00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.460
but the reality is we need to be pushing
it out into the mid 90s because it

00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:13.470
it out into the mid 90s because it
 

00:23:13.470 --> 00:23:16.790
it out into the mid 90s because it
doesn't if you're if you're working for

00:23:16.790 --> 00:23:16.800
doesn't if you're if you're working for
 

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.040
doesn't if you're if you're working for
a man and a woman a spouse and a husband

00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:19.050
a man and a woman a spouse and a husband
 

00:23:19.050 --> 00:23:20.780
a man and a woman a spouse and a husband
you know husband and a wife you don't

00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:20.790
you know husband and a wife you don't
 

00:23:20.790 --> 00:23:22.700
you know husband and a wife you don't
want it to work for only one of them you

00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:22.710
want it to work for only one of them you
 

00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:27.110
want it to work for only one of them you
want it to work for both of them so the

00:23:27.110 --> 00:23:27.120
want it to work for both of them so the
 

00:23:27.120 --> 00:23:30.530
want it to work for both of them so the
awareness of that reality is one of the

00:23:30.530 --> 00:23:30.540
awareness of that reality is one of the
 

00:23:30.540 --> 00:23:32.900
awareness of that reality is one of the
big changes that we didn't have you know

00:23:32.900 --> 00:23:32.910
big changes that we didn't have you know
 

00:23:32.910 --> 00:23:34.820
big changes that we didn't have you know
even ten years ago and I think this will

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:34.830
even ten years ago and I think this will
 

00:23:34.830 --> 00:23:37.270
even ten years ago and I think this will
only get

00:23:37.270 --> 00:23:37.280
only get
 

00:23:37.280 --> 00:23:40.270
only get
to be a bigger issue as healthcare

00:23:40.270 --> 00:23:40.280
to be a bigger issue as healthcare
 

00:23:40.280 --> 00:23:42.700
to be a bigger issue as healthcare
changes you know make that number go out

00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:42.710
changes you know make that number go out
 

00:23:42.710 --> 00:23:46.300
changes you know make that number go out
more so that's where the 30 come comes

00:23:46.300 --> 00:23:46.310
more so that's where the 30 come comes
 

00:23:46.310 --> 00:23:48.220
more so that's where the 30 come comes
from you want to plan with a 30 year

00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:48.230
from you want to plan with a 30 year
 

00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.320
from you want to plan with a 30 year

using that 65-year retirement age you

00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:55.910
using that 65-year retirement age you
 

00:23:55.910 --> 00:23:59.040
using that 65-year retirement age you
ought to plan on being able to

00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.050
ought to plan on being able to
 

00:23:59.050 --> 00:24:04.240
ought to plan on being able to
financially make it out to age 95 used

00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:04.250
financially make it out to age 95 used
 

00:24:04.250 --> 00:24:06.160
financially make it out to age 95 used
to be there was also a financial

00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:06.170
to be there was also a financial
 

00:24:06.170 --> 00:24:07.870
to be there was also a financial
planning objective you know you dare so

00:24:07.870 --> 00:24:07.880
planning objective you know you dare so
 

00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:09.070
planning objective you know you dare so
how much do you want to leave for the

00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:09.080
how much do you want to leave for the
 

00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:11.650
how much do you want to leave for the
next generation for the kids the

next generation for the kids the

next generation for the kids the
response to that one just isn't the same

00:24:13.060 --> 00:24:13.070
response to that one just isn't the same
 

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:15.580
response to that one just isn't the same
as it used to be it's like as long as I

00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:15.590
as it used to be it's like as long as I
 

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:17.740
as it used to be it's like as long as I
can get through you to my retirement the

00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:17.750
can get through you to my retirement the
 

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:19.330
can get through you to my retirement the
kids can take care of themselves I just

00:24:19.330 --> 00:24:19.340
kids can take care of themselves I just
 

00:24:19.340 --> 00:24:20.680
kids can take care of themselves I just
don't want to leave them a burden and

00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:20.690
don't want to leave them a burden and
 

00:24:20.690 --> 00:24:24.790
don't want to leave them a burden and
you know that that's enough so that's

00:24:24.790 --> 00:24:24.800
you know that that's enough so that's
 

00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:27.960
you know that that's enough so that's
part of this longevity situation as well

00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:27.970
part of this longevity situation as well
 

00:24:27.970 --> 00:24:36.610
part of this longevity situation as well
inflation risk I'm sorry Oh we'll come

00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:36.620
inflation risk I'm sorry Oh we'll come
 

00:24:36.620 --> 00:24:38.620

back to that one that relates to health

00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:38.630
back to that one that relates to health

back to that one that relates to health
care costs so this is just going to

00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:41.690
care costs so this is just going to
 

00:24:41.690 --> 00:24:43.780
care costs so this is just going to
those those numbers that we need to know

00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:43.790
those those numbers that we need to know
 

00:24:43.790 --> 00:24:45.610
those those numbers that we need to know
we've got five retirement risks we've

00:24:45.610 --> 00:24:45.620
we've got five retirement risks we've
 

00:24:45.620 --> 00:24:48.250
we've got five retirement risks we've
got a 30 year time horizon that we want

got a 30 year time horizon that we want
 

00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.590
got a 30 year time horizon that we want
to plan for and then we'll we'll work

right now inflation is pretty nice CPI

right now inflation is pretty nice CPI
you know is less than three percent but

00:26:18.279 --> 00:26:18.289
you know is less than three percent but
 

00:26:18.289 --> 00:26:20.139
you know is less than three percent but
the long-term average is three percent

00:26:20.139 --> 00:26:20.149
the long-term average is three percent
 

00:26:20.149 --> 00:26:22.629
the long-term average is three percent
and so I think that's a fair number to

00:26:22.629 --> 00:26:22.639
and so I think that's a fair number to
 

00:26:22.639 --> 00:26:24.969
and so I think that's a fair number to
use so it's sometimes easier to think

use so it's sometimes easier to think

all right the overspending the way we

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:25.630
all right the overspending the way we
 

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.120
all right the overspending the way we
think about overspending is really

taking too much out of the nest egg or
excess withdrawals it's how much can you

00:28:32.820 --> 00:28:32.830
excess withdrawals it's how much can you
 

00:28:32.830 --> 00:28:34.560
excess withdrawals it's how much can you
take out without imperiling the

00:29:10.180 --> 00:29:11.640
but when you would come out and say you
know what you need a balanced portfolio

00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:11.650
know what you need a balanced portfolio
 

00:29:11.650 --> 00:29:12.990
know what you need a balanced portfolio
of stocks and bonds and all this and

00:29:12.990 --> 00:29:13.000
of stocks and bonds and all this and
 

00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.930
of stocks and bonds and all this and
there would go are you crazy SP is going

00:29:15.930 --> 00:29:15.940
there would go are you crazy SP is going
 

00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:18.060
there would go are you crazy SP is going
up twenty-five percent I can go up

00:29:18.060 --> 00:29:18.070
up twenty-five percent I can go up
 

00:29:18.070 --> 00:29:19.500
up twenty-five percent I can go up
twenty-five percent a year take out ten

00:29:19.500 --> 00:29:19.510
twenty-five percent a year take out ten
 

00:29:19.510 --> 00:29:20.880
twenty-five percent a year take out ten
percent a year I'll never run out of

00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:20.890
percent a year I'll never run out of
 

00:29:20.890 --> 00:29:23.580
percent a year I'll never run out of
money and that works fine until you know

00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:23.590
money and that works fine until you know
 

00:29:23.590 --> 00:29:26.280
money and that works fine until you know
the market crashes so there's a reason

00:29:26.280 --> 00:29:26.290
the market crashes so there's a reason
 

00:29:26.290 --> 00:29:28.050
the market crashes so there's a reason
why you think about what the right

00:29:28.050 --> 00:29:28.060
why you think about what the right
 

00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.420
why you think about what the right
withdrawal rate is and it's not just the

00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:30.430
withdrawal rate is and it's not just the
 

00:29:30.430 --> 00:29:32.460
withdrawal rate is and it's not just the
return on the portfolio it's something

00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:32.470
return on the portfolio it's something
 

00:29:32.470 --> 00:29:36.780
return on the portfolio it's something
else so what you're looking for is a

00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:36.790
else so what you're looking for is a
 

00:29:36.790 --> 00:29:39.330
else so what you're looking for is a
sustainable withdrawal rate and

00:29:39.330 --> 00:29:39.340
sustainable withdrawal rate and
 

00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.550
sustainable withdrawal rate and
sustainable means that given the

00:29:41.550 --> 00:29:41.560
sustainable means that given the
 

00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:44.880
sustainable means that given the
longevity that we're concerned about you

00:29:44.880 --> 00:29:44.890
longevity that we're concerned about you
 

00:29:44.890 --> 00:29:47.730

you take out a certain amount it's going

00:29:49.890 --> 00:29:49.900
you take out a certain amount it's going
 

00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:51.810
you take out a certain amount it's going
to last for the period of time that you

00:29:51.810 --> 00:29:51.820
to last for the period of time that you
 

00:29:51.820 --> 00:29:55.350
to last for the period of time that you
need so we're thinking in terms of a

00:29:55.350 --> 00:29:55.360
need so we're thinking in terms of a
 

00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.920
need so we're thinking in terms of a
long period of time 30 years so what you

00:29:58.920 --> 00:29:58.930
long period of time 30 years so what you
 

00:29:58.930 --> 00:30:02.360
long period of time 30 years so what you
can look at is different allocations

00:30:02.360 --> 00:30:02.370
can look at is different allocations
 

00:30:02.370 --> 00:30:07.290
can look at is different allocations
mixes of stocks and bonds and what's a

00:30:07.290 --> 00:30:07.300
mixes of stocks and bonds and what's a
 

00:30:07.300 --> 00:30:09.870
mixes of stocks and bonds and what's a
supportable withdrawal rate and you'll

00:30:09.870 --> 00:30:09.880
supportable withdrawal rate and you'll
 

00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:11.220
supportable withdrawal rate and you'll
see different i got have different

00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:11.230

00:30:11.230 --> 00:30:14.520

00:30:14.530 --> 00:30:17.760

get too caught up on the the allocation

those returns because they do not come
 

00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:55.050
those returns because they do not come
in a straight line so these were the

in a straight line so these were the
 

00:30:55.060 --> 00:31:01.290

00:31:01.290 --> 00:31:01.300

in with five hundred thousand dollars in
 

00:31:04.200 --> 00:31:06.180
in with five hundred thousand dollars in
1973 and this is one of the worst

00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:06.190
1973 and this is one of the worst
 

00:31:06.190 --> 00:31:08.820
1973 and this is one of the worst
periods of stock market returns that we

00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:08.830
periods of stock market returns that we
 

00:31:08.830 --> 00:31:11.220
periods of stock market returns that we
had the the high inflation period of the

00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:11.230
had the the high inflation period of the
 

00:31:11.230 --> 00:31:15.210
had the the high inflation period of the
70's and into the early 80s and so what

00:31:15.210 --> 00:31:15.220
70's and into the early 80s and so what
 

00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:20.160
70's and into the early 80s and so what
would happen is those those negative

00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:20.170
would happen is those those negative
 

00:31:20.170 --> 00:31:23.180
would happen is those those negative

kept the portfolio from being able to
 

00:31:26.110 --> 00:31:29.700
kept the portfolio from being able to
maintain itself and eventually the

00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:29.710
maintain itself and eventually the
 

00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:31.980
maintain itself and eventually the
portfolio just would collapse in on

00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:31.990
portfolio just would collapse in on
 

00:31:31.990 --> 00:31:33.810
portfolio just would collapse in on
itself but if you just took that

itself but if you just took that

sequence of returns and flip them around
 

00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.980
sequence of returns and flip them around
you end up with a much different picture

00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:37.990
you end up with a much different picture
 

00:31:37.990 --> 00:31:42.330
you end up with a much different picture
and the problem is you don't know when

00:31:42.330 --> 00:31:42.340
and the problem is you don't know when
 

00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:46.470
and the problem is you don't know when
returns are going to to show themselves

00:31:46.470 --> 00:31:46.480
returns are going to to show themselves
 

00:31:46.480 --> 00:31:49.020
returns are going to to show themselves
positive or negative you have to take a

00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:49.030
positive or negative you have to take a
 

00:31:49.030 --> 00:31:51.630
positive or negative you have to take a

see is as you increase even by 1% that

00:34:25.610 --> 00:34:28.690
well the idea is that when you're
looking at these probabilities you're

00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:28.700
looking at these probabilities you're
 

00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.090
looking at these probabilities you're
using monte carlo simulation to simulate

a range of those different returns that
could happen if we say you want to make

00:39:11.370 --> 00:39:11.380
get it out of there is really the bond
 

00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:26.630

portion of the portfolio yes sir no no

00:39:26.630 --> 00:39:26.640
portion of the portfolio yes sir no no
 

00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:31.259
portion of the portfolio yes sir no no
no you don't yeah but but what I'm

00:39:31.259 --> 00:39:31.269
no you don't yeah but but what I'm
 

00:39:31.269 --> 00:39:32.519
no you don't yeah but but what I'm
saying is the structure of the

00:39:32.519 --> 00:39:32.529
saying is the structure of the
 

00:39:32.529 --> 00:39:34.589
saying is the structure of the
investments that underlie that you can

00:39:34.589 --> 00:39:34.599
investments that underlie that you can
 

00:39:34.599 --> 00:39:36.959
investments that underlie that you can
have different distribution options

00:39:36.959 --> 00:39:36.969
have different distribution options
 

00:39:36.969 --> 00:39:40.559
have different distribution options
there there there more bond like fixed

00:39:40.559 --> 00:39:40.569
there there there more bond like fixed
 

00:39:40.569 --> 00:39:49.190
there there there more bond like fixed
income like than they are stock like

00:39:49.190 --> 00:39:49.200
 
 

00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:53.309
 
history when you look back and say what

00:39:53.309 --> 00:39:53.319
history when you look back and say what
 

00:39:53.319 --> 00:39:54.719
history when you look back and say what
were the sustainable withdrawal rates

00:39:54.719 --> 00:39:54.729
were the sustainable withdrawal rates
 

00:39:54.729 --> 00:39:58.969
were the sustainable withdrawal rates
for the different levels of allocation

00:39:58.969 --> 00:39:58.979
for the different levels of allocation
 

00:39:58.979 --> 00:40:03.029
for the different levels of allocation
so two percent 4% 68 so on you actually

00:40:03.029 --> 00:40:03.039
so two percent 4% 68 so on you actually
 

00:40:03.039 --> 00:40:05.910
so two percent 4% 68 so on you actually
do have periods of time and you can see

00:40:05.910 --> 00:40:05.920
do have periods of time and you can see
 

00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:09.420
do have periods of time and you can see
the periods that that were we're looking

00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:09.430
the periods that that were we're looking
 

00:40:09.430 --> 00:40:12.120
the periods that that were we're looking
at you do have periods of time 30 year

00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:12.130
at you do have periods of time 30 year
 

00:40:12.130 --> 00:40:14.269
at you do have periods of time 30 year
periods of time where you could have a

00:40:14.269 --> 00:40:14.279
periods of time where you could have a
 

00:40:14.279 --> 00:40:18.059
periods of time where you could have a
relatively high withdrawal rate the the

00:40:18.059 --> 00:40:18.069
relatively high withdrawal rate the the
 

00:40:18.069 --> 00:40:21.749
relatively high withdrawal rate the the
problem is it's the probabilities just

00:40:21.749 --> 00:40:21.759
problem is it's the probabilities just
 

00:40:21.759 --> 00:40:22.950
problem is it's the probabilities just
not going to be high enough that you're

00:40:22.950 --> 00:40:22.960
not going to be high enough that you're
 

00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.140
not going to be high enough that you're
going to be lucky enough to be retiring

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:25.150
going to be lucky enough to be retiring
 

00:40:25.150 --> 00:40:27.040
going to be lucky enough to be retiring
in advance of one of the

in advance of one of the
 

00:40:27.050 --> 00:40:29.890
in advance of one of the
bull market periods that would allow you

00:40:29.890 --> 00:40:29.900
bull market periods that would allow you
 

00:40:29.900 --> 00:40:32.980
bull market periods that would allow you
to have that high withdrawal rate what's

00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:32.990
to have that high withdrawal rate what's
 

00:40:32.990 --> 00:40:35.560
to have that high withdrawal rate what's
the downside of a low withdrawal rate

00:40:35.560 --> 00:40:35.570
the downside of a low withdrawal rate
 

00:40:35.570 --> 00:40:37.840
the downside of a low withdrawal rate
you might end up with too much money

00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:37.850
you might end up with too much money
 

00:40:37.850 --> 00:40:41.470
you might end up with too much money
when you die and that's not something

when you die and that's not something
 

00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:43.120
when you die and that's not something
you necessarily target for but it's

00:40:43.120 --> 00:40:43.130
you necessarily target for but it's
 

00:40:43.130 --> 00:41:07.840
you necessarily target for but it's
better than the alternative okay yes so

00:41:07.840 --> 00:41:07.850
better than the alternative okay yes so
 

00:41:07.850 --> 00:41:10.120

is that you get a better investment

00:42:00.200 --> 00:42:00.210
is that you get a better investment
 

00:42:00.210 --> 00:42:04.610
is that you get a better investment
experience by keeping your expenses low

which pushes me to always say a passive
investment approach is better than an

00:42:10.740 --> 00:42:10.750
investment approach is better than an
 

00:42:10.750 --> 00:42:13.200
investment approach is better than an
active expensive investment approach

00:42:13.200 --> 00:42:13.210
active expensive investment approach
 

00:42:13.210 --> 00:42:17.730

you know it's it's a low percentage

00:43:04.050 --> 00:43:04.060
you know it's it's a low percentage
 

00:43:04.060 --> 00:43:05.820
you know it's it's a low percentage
relative to what the marketing would

total return paycheck replacement and
 

00:58:05.710 --> 00:58:08.279
total return paycheck replacement and
all that means is you don't lock it up

all that means is you don't lock it up
 

00:58:08.289 --> 00:58:12.210
all that means is you don't lock it up

liquidity out obviously you've got to
replace that liquidity and the way you

01:00:45.750 --> 01:00:45.760
replace that liquidity and the way you
 

01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.140
replace that liquidity and the way you
replace that liquidity is just have a

01:00:48.140 --> 01:00:48.150
replace that liquidity is just have a
 

01:00:48.150 --> 01:00:52.320

and they're now 6040 and you need to
 

01:01:00.910 --> 01:01:04.230
and they're now 6040 and you need to
take liquidity out even if stocks are
