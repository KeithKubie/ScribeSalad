Hi I'm Bob Forbes and the question before
us is will global growth be restored in 2009?

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:12.070
Certainly here at Davos there seems to be
a lot of gloom and doom.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:17.790
But a certain amount of pessimism is being
offset by optimism.

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:24.220
I personally think that by 2009 that markets
will be up and I have a 100 Swiss frank bet

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:29.730
saying that this time next year the markets
are going to be higher than they are today.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:30.230
Thanks.
