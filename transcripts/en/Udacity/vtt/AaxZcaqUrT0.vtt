00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:05.780
Give -4x &lt; 16,
what are the possible values for x?

00:00:06.800 --> 00:00:08.430
Enter your solution set here.

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.460
I've all ready written x for you.

00:00:10.460 --> 00:00:15.340
In this box &lt; or &gt;,
these are keys on your keyboard.

00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:18.865
The less than is what you get
when you hit Chift+Comma and

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:22.618
the greater than is what you
get when you hit Shift+Period.

00:00:22.618 --> 00:00:25.447
And then enter the number
that x is greater than or

00:00:25.447 --> 00:00:30.300
less than in this box and let me just
show you really quickly on my keyboard.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.370
To get the less than symbol I would
hit Shift and then this key, and

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.660
to get the greater than symbol again
I would hit Shift and then this key.
