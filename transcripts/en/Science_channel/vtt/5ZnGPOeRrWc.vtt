00:00:03.634 --> 00:00:06.234
MAASTRICHT, HOLLAND,
WHERE APPARENTLY,

00:00:06.234 --> 00:00:08.000
CARS PARK THEMSELVES.

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.334
Linsell: SWEET CAR,
BUT WHERE'S THE DRIVER?

00:00:11.334 --> 00:00:13.300
Parker: WE'VE SEEN DRIVERLESS
CARS BEFORE

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.968
AND THEY'RE NORMALLY PACKED
WITH WIRES AND ELECTRONICS.

00:00:15.968 --> 00:00:19.501
BUT IN THIS CASE,
WE CAN'T SEE ANY CONTROLS

00:00:19.501 --> 00:00:21.367
AND IT'S DOING DOUGHNUTS.

00:00:21.367 --> 00:00:22.934
Narrator:
CREATED BY BJORN HARMS,

00:00:22.934 --> 00:00:25.400
HE CLAIMS HE'S CONTROLLING
THIS FULL-SIZE MUSCLE CAR

00:00:25.400 --> 00:00:28.367
USING JUST AN RC CONTROLLER.

00:00:28.367 --> 00:00:29.567
IT WORKS!

00:00:29.567 --> 00:00:31.667
I JUST DON'T GET
HOW HE'S DOING IT.

00:00:31.667 --> 00:00:34.501
I CAN'T SEE ANY MOTORS
OR CONTROLS.

00:00:34.501 --> 00:00:36.834
Wrigglesworth:
THIS LOOKS REALLY ADVANCED.

00:00:36.834 --> 00:00:38.133
Ruben: I LOVE THIS CLIP.

00:00:38.133 --> 00:00:39.567
I DON'T CARE
IF IT'S REAL OR FAKE.

00:00:39.567 --> 00:00:40.901
DON'T EVEN TELL ME.

00:00:40.901 --> 00:00:42.300
Narrator:
WE WENT TO HOLLAND TO FIND OUT

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.067
IF THIS CAR REALLY IS
BEING CONTROLLED REMOTELY.

00:00:45.067 --> 00:00:46.501
I THINK IT'S REAL.

00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:49.167
Kundu: I'M NOT REMOTELY
CONVINCED BY THIS.

00:00:49.167 --> 00:00:52.067
Narrator:
TELL US, BJORN, IS THIS REALLY
A REMOTE-CONTROLLED CAR,

00:00:52.067 --> 00:00:53.801
OR IS THIS V8 A FAKE?

00:00:53.801 --> 00:00:56.200
Bjorn: THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE
THAT THINK THAT IT'S FAKE.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.501
IT REALLY ISN'T.

00:00:57.501 --> 00:01:00.100
IT'S AN RC CAR
WITH 404 HORSEPOWER.

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:02.901
IS THIS CRAZY?
DEFINITELY.

00:01:02.901 --> 00:01:05.501
THIS IS EPIC.
WOO-HOO! THIS IS RAD!

00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:06.901
Narrator: YEAH,
WE THINK SO TOO.

00:01:06.901 --> 00:01:08.734
BUT HOW IS THIS CORVETTE
CONTROLLED?

00:01:08.734 --> 00:01:11.868
BJORN HAD A DREAM OF BUILDING
A FULL-SIZED REMOTE-CONTROL CAR.

00:01:11.868 --> 00:01:13.901
SO HE TOOK HIS OWN SPORTS CAR

00:01:13.901 --> 00:01:15.634
AND MODIFIED IT
SO IT CAN BE DRIVEN

00:01:15.634 --> 00:01:17.634
REMOTELY AND MANUALLY.

00:01:17.634 --> 00:01:19.701
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN MY RC CAR

00:01:19.701 --> 00:01:22.667
AND OTHER CARS THAT ARE ALSO
RC-CONTROLLED

00:01:22.667 --> 00:01:24.934
IS THAT I BUILT ALL THE SERVOS,

00:01:24.934 --> 00:01:27.300
ALL THE MOTORS
INSIDE THE DASHBOARD,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:28.567
AND ON THE CONTROLS

00:01:28.567 --> 00:01:31.501
SO THAT THE INTERIOR
LOOKS COMPLETELY STOCK.

00:01:31.501 --> 00:01:34.200
Arney: I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
GUY'S DONE IT ALL BY HIMSELF.

00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.901
IT LOOKS SEAMLESS.

00:01:35.901 --> 00:01:37.834
North: BJORN HAS A RADIO
CONTROLLER IN HIS HANDS

00:01:37.834 --> 00:01:40.667
THAT SENDS RADIO WAVES
TO A RECEIVER IN THE GLOVE BOX.

00:01:40.667 --> 00:01:42.133
THOSE SIGNALS ARE DECODED.

00:01:42.133 --> 00:01:43.501
AND THEN THEY SEND
VARIOUS SIGNALS

00:01:43.501 --> 00:01:45.601
TO ALL THE COMPONENTS
TO CONTROL THE CAR.

00:01:45.601 --> 00:01:46.934
TO STEER THE CAR BACK AND FORTH,

00:01:46.934 --> 00:01:48.501
BJORN SENDS A SIGNAL
TO THE RECEIVER,

00:01:48.501 --> 00:01:51.000
WHICH DRIVES A MOTOR
LOCATED UNDER THE DASHBOARD.

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:52.667
THIS OTHER MOTOR MOVES
THE STEERING WHEEL

00:01:52.667 --> 00:01:54.133
AND THEREFORE THE TIRES.

00:01:54.133 --> 00:01:58.100
AS YOU CAN SEE,
THIS WHEEL TURNS THE WHEEL.

00:01:58.100 --> 00:02:00.501
THIS CONTROL CHANGES THE GEAR.

00:02:00.501 --> 00:02:03.801
SO IF BJORN WANTS THE CAR
TO ACCELERATE,

00:02:03.801 --> 00:02:06.634
HE SENDS THAT SIGNAL WITH HIS
CONTROLLER TO THE RECEIVER.

00:02:06.634 --> 00:02:08.534
THE RECEIVER
THEN TALKS TO THE MOTOR,

00:02:08.534 --> 00:02:11.601
WHICH THEN MOVES A LEVER
THAT PUSHES THE ACCELERATOR.

00:02:11.601 --> 00:02:14.901
AND OF COURSE, BRAKING.

00:02:14.901 --> 00:02:16.601
AND THROTTLE.

00:02:16.601 --> 00:02:19.200
[ ENGINE REVVING ]

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:22.000
DUE TO THE SPEED OF THE RADIO
SIGNALS AND THE PROCESSOR,

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.868
THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO DELAY.

00:02:23.868 --> 00:02:27.734
HOWEVER, A FULL-SIZE CAR
WILL REACT A LOT SLOWER

00:02:27.734 --> 00:02:29.100
THAN A TOY CAR EQUIVALENT

00:02:29.100 --> 00:02:32.000
BECAUSE OF ITS INCREASED
SIZE AND MASS.

00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.334
WITH MORE MASS,
IT MEANS IT HAS MORE INERTIA.

00:02:34.334 --> 00:02:36.067
AND THAT MEANS
A GREATER RESISTANCE

00:02:36.067 --> 00:02:37.467
TO A CHANGE IN MOTION.

00:02:37.467 --> 00:02:38.968
Gradman: IN CONTRAST TO HOW
HE WOULD BRAKE

00:02:38.968 --> 00:02:40.667
A SMALL REMOTE-CONTROL CAR,

00:02:40.667 --> 00:02:43.167
HE HAS TO BRAKE HIS CORVETTE
A LOT EARLIER.

00:02:43.167 --> 00:02:46.300
DRIVING IS PRETTY HARD
ON A FULL-SCALE CAR.

00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:48.801
YOU'VE GOT TO GET A FEEL
FOR THE BRAKING

00:02:48.801 --> 00:02:50.901
AND NOT SLAMMING IT
WITH YOUR FINGER.

00:02:50.901 --> 00:02:53.267
SO IN THE END,
BJORN'S BIGGEST LIMITATION

00:02:53.267 --> 00:02:54.868
IS HIS OWN REACTION TIME.

00:02:54.868 --> 00:02:57.100
BUT BECAUSE OF HIS EPIC
DRIVING SKILLS,

00:02:57.100 --> 00:02:58.801
HE'S BEEN ABLE TO PULL THIS OFF.
