Geat work if you got each of these. For the last one you just needed to type a

00:00:05.035 --> 00:00:10.020
5, a forward slash, a 3 and then the over arrow key. This over arrow key will

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:14.892
move our cursor from down in the denominator to up here next to the fraction.

00:00:14.892 --> 00:00:19.734
Next you would type an x a minus sign, the number eleven a forward slash and a

00:00:19.734 --> 00:00:22.636
three. This would finish out your expression.
