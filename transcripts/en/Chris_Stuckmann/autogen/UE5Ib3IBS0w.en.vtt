this film requires that children to be

00:03:26.690 --> 00:03:26.700
this film requires that children to be
 

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:29.780
this film requires that children to be
in danger but they're really not for

00:03:29.780 --> 00:03:29.790
in danger but they're really not for
 

00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:31.699
in danger but they're really not for
most of the movie they're regulated to

00:03:31.699 --> 00:03:31.709
most of the movie they're regulated to
 

00:03:31.709 --> 00:03:34.160
most of the movie they're regulated to
one room for pretty much the entire film

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:34.170
one room for pretty much the entire film
 

00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:35.870
one room for pretty much the entire film
and they don't interact with the robbers

00:03:35.870 --> 00:03:35.880
and they don't interact with the robbers
 

00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.520
and they don't interact with the robbers
that much they're basically just in that

00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:37.530
that much they're basically just in that
 

00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:39.259
that much they're basically just in that
room for the majority of the movie and

00:03:39.259 --> 00:03:39.269
room for the majority of the movie and
 

00:03:39.269 --> 00:03:40.970
room for the majority of the movie and
so the sense of danger for their lives

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:40.980
so the sense of danger for their lives
 

00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:42.650
so the sense of danger for their lives
is very minimal because they're hardly

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:42.660

the Edit of breaking in because

00:03:48.170 --> 00:03:48.180
the Edit of breaking in because
 

00:03:48.180 --> 00:03:50.270
the Edit of breaking in because
surprisingly I have a lot to say let's

00:03:50.270 --> 00:03:50.280
surprisingly I have a lot to say let's
 

00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.860
surprisingly I have a lot to say let's
push your side the technical part of

00:03:53.750 --> 00:03:53.760
editing first and focus on censorship
 

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.580
editing first and focus on censorship
because there are a lot of scenes in the

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:55.590
because there are a lot of scenes in the
 

00:03:55.590 --> 00:03:57.530
because there are a lot of scenes in the
movie where characters seem to mouth the

00:03:57.530 --> 00:03:57.540
movie where characters seem to mouth the
 

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.690
movie where characters seem to mouth the
f-word and it's replaced with freaking

there were moments where it played like
 

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:02.750
there were moments where it played like
a movie that had been edited for

technical part of editing this film

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:11.010
technical part of editing this film
 

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.039
technical part of editing this film
feels very loose and I don't mean that

00:04:13.039 --> 00:04:13.049
feels very loose and I don't mean that
 

00:04:13.049 --> 00:04:14.539
feels very loose and I don't mean that
in a positive way

00:04:14.539 --> 00:04:14.549
in a positive way
 

00:04:14.549 --> 00:04:16.430
in a positive way
it feels like the film needed at least

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:16.440
it feels like the film needed at least
 

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.050
it feels like the film needed at least
two or three more passes but it's

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:18.060
two or three more passes but it's
 

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.210
two or three more passes but it's
already under 90 minutes and that's with

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:20.220
already under 90 minutes and that's with
 

00:04:20.220 --> 00:04:22.630
already under 90 minutes and that's with
an opening sequence in slow motion that

00:04:22.630 --> 00:04:22.640
an opening sequence in slow motion that
 

00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:25.940
an opening sequence in slow motion that
stretches out the runtime even more so

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:25.950
stretches out the runtime even more so
 

00:04:25.950 --> 00:04:26.700
stretches out the runtime even more so
much of this

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:26.710
much of this

don't mean this again in a positive way

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:31.720
don't mean this again in a positive way
 

00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:34.080
don't mean this again in a positive way
almost every shot goes on for longer

00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:34.090
