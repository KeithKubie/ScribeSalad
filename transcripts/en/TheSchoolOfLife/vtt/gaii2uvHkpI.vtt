00:00:01.120 --> 00:00:06.609
Why are we so worried about our careers? Why
do we care so much about our reputations?

00:00:06.609 --> 00:00:11.820
Partly it’s to do with money of course,
but there’s another, more psychological

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:16.740
aspect to our fears as well.
We worry because we suspect – not wrongly

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:21.910
– that the world is full of a frightening
sort of person ready to judge us ruthlessly

00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:30.510
and swiftly: a person we can call a snob.
A snob is anyone who takes a relatively small

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:36.260
part of us and uses it to come to a rigid
and unbudgeable conclusion about how much

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:41.739
of their attention we deserve. In the past,
that might have meant a snob being interested

00:00:41.739 --> 00:00:48.749
in your lineage and royal connections. Nowadays,
the snob cares about one thing only: what

00:00:48.749 --> 00:00:52.819
you do for a living.
This explains why the first question we will

00:00:52.819 --> 00:00:58.980
be asked in any new social context is ‘What
do you do?’ and according to how we answer,

00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:04.739
snobs will either welcome us with broad smiles,
or swiftly abandon us by the peanuts. The

00:01:04.739 --> 00:01:09.440
opposite of a snob is your mother – not
necessarily your mother in particular – but

00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.270
the ideal mother, someone who doesn’t care
so much what we have achieved, but who thinks about who

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.890
we are in the broad sense. But most of the
world is not like our mothers – and that

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:26.670
is why we are fired up by such a desperate
urge to achieve and impress.

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:31.680
Sometimes our behaviour is mistaken for greed
and vanity, but it is more poignant than this.

00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:37.950
A lot of our interest in fancy cars, jobs
and houses has nothing to do with materialism.

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:43.810
It has to do with a hunger for the respect
and esteem that is only available in our societies

00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:48.981
through the acquisition of material goods.
It isn’t the goods themselves we seek, it

00:01:48.981 --> 00:01:55.140
is the love we stand to gain through our possession
of them. The next time we see someone driving

00:01:55.140 --> 00:02:00.730
a Ferrari, we shouldn’t condemn them for
their greed, we should pity them for the intensity

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:07.280
of their need for love from the world. At
the root of snobbery is a lack of imagination

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:12.780
and confidence about how to decide who in
the world is valuable. The snob isn’t wrong

00:02:12.780 --> 00:02:17.890
in their background sense that there are better
and worse sorts of people around. They are

00:02:17.890 --> 00:02:23.549
just brutally misguided and slavish in their
beliefs about how the superior individuals

00:02:23.549 --> 00:02:30.180
can identified. For snobs, it is the already-acclaimed
and already successful who are the only ones

00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.769
worthy of respect. There is no room in their
timid regimented minds to imagine that someone

00:02:35.769 --> 00:02:41.440
might be clever, kind or good – and yet
somehow have been overlooked entirely by society,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:47.299
their qualities lurking beneath an unfamiliar
guise, and having as yet discovered no obvious

00:02:47.299 --> 00:02:51.329
outlets.
Touchingly, the personal origins of snobbery

00:02:51.329 --> 00:02:57.079
typically lie in parents who were themselves
snobs – and never endowed their offspring

00:02:57.079 --> 00:03:02.680
with the confidence to judge each new person
on their own terms, without reference to social

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.969
status, income and reputation. Despite their
commitment to surrounding themselves by people

00:03:07.969 --> 00:03:13.980
of high status, ironically, snobs constantly
fail to spot who might one day be feted and

00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:20.049
applauded. They are misled by the unexpected
outward forms that brilliance often takes.

00:03:20.049 --> 00:03:24.980
Snobs don’t sign up the Beatles, don’t
invest in the start-up iteration of Google

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:30.060
or Apple, don’t give the time of day to
the taxi driver who might one day be the president

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:35.319
or the old lady in a woolly hat writing the
great novel of the 21st century.

00:03:35.319 --> 00:03:39.540
The true answer to snobbery is not to say
that there is no such thing as a better or

00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:45.219
worse person, but to insist that better or
worse exist in constantly unexpected places

00:03:45.219 --> 00:03:50.859
and carry none of the outward signs of distinction.
And because we are such poor judges of the

00:03:50.859 --> 00:03:56.969
worth of others, our ultimate duty remains
to be kind, good, curious and imaginative

00:03:56.969 --> 00:04:03.129
about pretty much everyone who ever crosses
our path – and that includes ourselves.
