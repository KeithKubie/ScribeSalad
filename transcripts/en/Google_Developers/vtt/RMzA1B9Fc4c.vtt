JENNY MURPHY: Hi, Jenny here
from the Glass Developer

00:00:03.250 --> 00:00:04.490
Relations team.

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:07.770
And I'm going to show you how
to get started with PHP and

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:10.110
the Mirror API.

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:12.450
So I'm going to show you the
easiest way to get started is

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:14.480
with a quick start project.

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:16.390
So you can see we have a bunch
of different quick start

00:00:16.390 --> 00:00:19.150
projects in several different
languages.

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:21.250
But today, we're
interested PHP.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.550
So let's click here.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:25.450
You may be interested
to know what you're

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.410
getting yourself into.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.690
So let's take a look at a demo
instance we have, in this

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.120
case, written in Java.

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.310
So we'll click on this
link and open it up.

00:00:33.310 --> 00:00:35.760
This gives you an idea of what
to expect from one of these

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:37.040
quick starts.

00:00:37.040 --> 00:00:39.440
You can see that it gives you
a foundation from which you

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.310
can build on top of, and build
your software quickly, and not

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.000
worry about all that
boilerplate code.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.740
It also demonstrates a few
common patterns we expect you

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.910
to use in your Glassware,
sending a timeline card with

00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.570
an attachment, spending timeline
items to all of your

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.510
users, managing contacts and

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.370
subscriptions, stuff like that.

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.160
OK, let's see how to
get you started.

00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:02.530
First thing we're going
to want to do is

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:04.250
download the code.

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:05.830
We're going to click on this
big link that'll take us to

00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:09.020
GitHub, where we can click the
download zip button and

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.810
download the project.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.590
Let's switch over to our
terminal and let's start

00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.200
setting it up.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:16.650
So we're going to go
into downloads and

00:01:16.650 --> 00:01:17.900
unzip what we have.

00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:26.080
So we unzip the zip.

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:27.860
File It's going to
extract into a

00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.520
directory, which we'll enter.

00:01:30.520 --> 00:01:32.000
And there's a bunch
of files in there.

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.480
But we only care about one,
the config.php file.

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:37.670
So let's open up
a text editor.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:40.180
And take a look at
what's in there.

00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:41.340
This is the file we're
going to modify

00:01:41.340 --> 00:01:43.000
the set up the project.

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.520
There are a few different
parameters that we're going to

00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:48.310
set, the API information, which
we're going to get from

00:01:48.310 --> 00:01:52.780
the API's console, a base URL
that tells our project where

00:01:52.780 --> 00:01:55.160
it is on our system which
depends a lot on your system

00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:57.710
configuration, and then finally,
a place for it to

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:00.120
store temporary data.

00:02:00.120 --> 00:02:03.290
Let's get started with API
client configuration.

00:02:03.290 --> 00:02:05.750
We have three values and we're
going to get them from the

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:07.940
Google API console.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:10.729
So we'll switch back over
to our browser.

00:02:10.729 --> 00:02:12.670
You can find the Google
API console at

00:02:12.670 --> 00:02:16.950
code.google.com/APIs/console.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:19.000
I've created a new project
for us to start with.

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.030
But if you've entered this
console and you don't have a

00:02:21.030 --> 00:02:23.400
project, it's your first time
there, it's going to create a

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.540
project for you.

00:02:25.540 --> 00:02:27.890
So the first thing that we're
going to want to do is turn on

00:02:27.890 --> 00:02:30.400
the API from the services tab.

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.850
So we're going to scroll on down
to the Google Mirror API,

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.090
right down here.

00:02:35.090 --> 00:02:38.010
And we're going to
click the toggle.

00:02:38.010 --> 00:02:41.430
This may bring up developer
terms, which you'll probably

00:02:41.430 --> 00:02:43.860
want to agree with
to use the API.

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.515
Now that it's enabled, we can
go up and scroll back up and

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:48.630
set up API access.

00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:52.190
So click on API access to
bring up this new panel.

00:02:52.190 --> 00:02:55.330
Then click on the inviting,
large blue button.

00:02:55.330 --> 00:02:57.420
It's going to ask some questions
about the project

00:02:57.420 --> 00:02:58.270
we're installing.

00:02:58.270 --> 00:03:05.306
So Awesome Projects,
spelt right.

00:03:05.306 --> 00:03:07.410
And then it's going to have some
more questions about how

00:03:07.410 --> 00:03:09.600
our project is set up.

00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:11.930
Mirror API software is usually
in the form of a web

00:03:11.930 --> 00:03:13.650
application and so is
this quick start.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:16.430
So we're going to leave the
top set to default.

00:03:16.430 --> 00:03:18.870
Down below, we need to tell it
where we're going to run it.

00:03:18.870 --> 00:03:20.880
We're going to start by running
it on our laptop, on

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.750
local host.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.780
So we're going to want to turn
off HTTPS and tell it running

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.860
at local host.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:30.640
And then whatever the directory
is that you're going

00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:32.390
to be putting it on
your local system.

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:36.160
In my case, a directory
called web.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:38.990
And then the PHP quick
start has a php file

00:03:38.990 --> 00:03:40.290
for the OAuth callback.

00:03:40.290 --> 00:03:48.220
So authtocallback.php,
click the Enter.

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:51.570
And then click Create
Client ID.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.780
This is going to set up all of
our settings for the project.

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.030
If things are set up correctly,
you should see the

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:01.160
URL to the web directory your
have available followed by

00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.410
[? oauthtocall.php. ?]

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:09.390
Now we just need a copy
some entries from this

00:04:09.390 --> 00:04:10.880
page into our file.

00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.260
So first we're going to start
with the client ID.

00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:14.860
So we're going to copy that.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:16.360
Come back on over.

00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:21.000
And we're going to paste it
in here for API client ID.

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.000
Then we're going to grab
our client secret.

00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.060
It's just two lines below
on the webpage.

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:33.110
A simple API key, which is down
in a box just below, down

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:35.155
here, under simple API access.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:43.610
And then next, we're going to
configure the base URL.

00:04:43.610 --> 00:04:45.720
As I mentioned, I'm running in a
different directory than the

00:04:45.720 --> 00:04:46.950
default value is here.

00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.110
So let's change this to /web.

00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:54.610
And then finally, the
SQLite database.

00:04:54.610 --> 00:04:57.440
The quick start uses SQLite to
persist data, which you'll

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.550
probably want to change if
you actually deploy it.

00:04:59.550 --> 00:05:01.480
But it's a great way
to get started.

00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:05.130
You can just put a file here
that's any place the web

00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:06.160
server can write to.

00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.900
I just chose /temp because it's
writeable by web servers

00:05:08.900 --> 00:05:09.910
in most installations.

00:05:09.910 --> 00:05:13.060
But this'll vary based on
your configuration.

00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:15.450
So let's save that file.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.400
And next, we'll either set up
a symlink, or move, or just

00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:21.370
somehow get all the stuff into
that web accessible directory.

00:05:21.370 --> 00:05:22.550
This is another thing
that's going to

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:24.040
depend on your system.

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:27.320
Maybe you want to set up a
symlink, copy it over.

00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.180
In my case, I'm just
going to move it.

00:05:29.180 --> 00:05:32.320
So I'm going to move all those
files to that web directory

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:34.170
that I have set up, which
is accessible from

00:05:34.170 --> 00:05:36.100
my local web server.

00:05:36.100 --> 00:05:38.430
So it's all moved in.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.500
Let's take a look
at what's there.

00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:43.870
So back to the web browser.

00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:46.400
I'm going to go to
localhost/web, that directory

00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:50.520
I set up and we see the
authentication page for the

00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.170
quick start project.

00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:55.450
Clicking Accept completes the
OAuth dance and gives the

00:05:55.450 --> 00:05:58.050
quick start project access
to my Glass, the one I'm

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.870
wearing right now.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.070
And as message has already been
delivered to my Glass

00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.280
welcoming me to the
PHP start project.

00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:07.660
You can click on these buttons
and it'll do more stuff.

00:06:07.660 --> 00:06:11.630
In this case, I'm inserting
a picture of Chipotle, our

00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:12.880
friendly cat.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:18.750
And it was delivered.

00:06:18.750 --> 00:06:21.250
And that's as simple
as it is to set up.

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:23.500
Now you can build software
on top of this.

00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:26.490
You can modify these functions
and copy and paste.

00:06:26.490 --> 00:06:29.050
And just to get going on
whatever you want to build.

00:06:29.050 --> 00:06:30.200
And that's that.

00:06:30.200 --> 00:06:32.670
Thanks very much for downloading
and running the

00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:34.220
PHP quick start project.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:36.290
We really look forward to seeing
what you come up with.
