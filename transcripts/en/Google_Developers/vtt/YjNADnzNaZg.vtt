00:00:06.874 --> 00:00:09.810
CAT ALLMAN: Hi, I'm Cat Allman
with Google's Open Source

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:11.020
Programs office.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:14.050
I'm here today with my
colleague, Stephanie Taylor.

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:16.700
Stephanie manages
Google Code-in.

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:21.160
Its our contest for younger
open source developers.

00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.880
Stephanie, tell us about
Google Code-in.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.040
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: Well, Google
Code-in is a contest that's

00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.120
held entirely online, that's
global, that is geared towards

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:33.910
13- to 17-year-old
pre-university students--

00:00:33.910 --> 00:00:35.510
so generally high school
students--

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.330
that are interested in learning
more about open

00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:38.920
source software development.

00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.160
We choose 10 open source
projects that will act as

00:00:42.160 --> 00:00:45.730
mentoring organizations, that
create a list of tasks in a

00:00:45.730 --> 00:00:47.660
variety of different categories
for the students

00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.130
work on during a seven
week contest.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:53.890
And this year the contest begins
on November 18, 2013

00:00:53.890 --> 00:00:57.110
and goes until January
6, 2014.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:58.560
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.270
Google Code-in, does this is
mean it's only coding?

00:01:02.270 --> 00:01:03.020
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: No.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.440
With open source software
projects, there are a variety

00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:08.040
of different skill sets
needed to make an open

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:09.300
source project thrive.

00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:12.570
So we try to reflect that in
the Google Code-in contest.

00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:15.030
So we have coding tasks, of
course, but there are also

00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.900
documentation tasks, training,
UI, and a few other different

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:20.550
categories that students
can choose from.

00:01:20.550 --> 00:01:21.540
CAT ALLMAN: Great.

00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:25.130
What kinds of open source
projects participate as

00:01:25.130 --> 00:01:26.920
mentoring organizations?

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.040
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: Well, on
November 1 is when we're going

00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:31.590
to actually announce the 10 open
source projects that will

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:35.100
be acting as the mentoring
organizations for 2013.

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:39.430
But, generally in the past,
we've had disaster relief

00:01:39.430 --> 00:01:43.270
software projects, we've had
graphical desktops, we've had

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:46.550
gaming projects, and a variety
of operating systems.

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:49.460
CAT ALLMAN: So all kinds of
things so that there's

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:51.130
different kinds of things
to motivate

00:01:51.130 --> 00:01:52.460
students to get involved.

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:52.785
That's great.

00:01:52.785 --> 00:01:53.890
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: Exactly.

00:01:53.890 --> 00:01:58.760
CAT ALLMAN: So it's a contest,
so there are prizes.

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.690
But are there benefits
beyond cool stuff?

00:02:01.690 --> 00:02:02.480
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: Definitely.

00:02:02.480 --> 00:02:05.340
Now, everyone likes to get a
prize, but it's also really

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:08.370
fun for the students to actually
use the computer

00:02:08.370 --> 00:02:11.820
science skills that they've
learned in school or on their

00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.620
own to actually apply
those skills to real

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.710
world software projects.

00:02:17.710 --> 00:02:22.950
So they also get to become part
of a community, and being

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:26.180
appreciated for their work and
their ideas is a huge boost

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:29.190
for, generally, these
teenagers.

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:33.130
So it's cool to see your code
actually in a project or to

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:37.820
see the film that you recorded
describing the Open Source

00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:39.740
project actually on screen.

00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:41.330
CAT ALLMAN: How cool.

00:02:41.330 --> 00:02:44.260
How does the contest actually
work, though?

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.790
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: So starting
on November 18, students

00:02:46.790 --> 00:02:49.380
actually will go to the contest
site-- which is

00:02:49.380 --> 00:02:51.372
google-melange.com--

00:02:51.372 --> 00:02:53.610
and they can register,
and then they can

00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:55.800
start claiming tasks.

00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.250
There's a huge list of tasks up
there that they can choose

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:01.100
from, and when they find
something that interests them,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:03.300
they just choose it, and they
start working on it.

00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:05.560
And if they have any questions
along the way, there are

00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:07.390
mentors that are actually
assigned to each of those

00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:08.930
tasks that are there
to help them.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:10.520
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:13.462
Now, I know I was
saying benefits,

00:03:13.462 --> 00:03:16.130
but grand prize trip.

00:03:16.130 --> 00:03:16.490
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: Yes.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:18.190
That is a very popular
question.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:20.810
Everybody likes to hear about
the grand prize trip.

00:03:20.810 --> 00:03:24.740
So when students complete one
task, they actually will get a

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:26.060
certificate of completion.

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:28.290
When they complete three tasks,
they get a Google

00:03:28.290 --> 00:03:29.470
Code-in t-shirt.

00:03:29.470 --> 00:03:30.780
So that's pretty cool.

00:03:30.780 --> 00:03:34.650
But we'll also have 20 students
who are going to win

00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.400
a grand prize trip to
Google's Mountain

00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:38.380
View, California campus.

00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:41.610
And that will be for themselves
and a parent next

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.645
spring for about four nights.

00:03:43.645 --> 00:03:43.980
CAT ALLMAN: Oh.

00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:45.290
I've been on this trip.

00:03:45.290 --> 00:03:47.050
It's pretty fun.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:49.840
So let's see.

00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.790
Where can they go for more

00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:54.570
information besides the website?

00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.230
STEPHANIE TAYLOR: We also have
the Google Open Source blog,

00:03:57.230 --> 00:04:00.490
and they can join the Google
Code-in discussion list where

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:04.330
they can ask questions, and
other students, mentors and

00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.420
Google program administrators
will answer their

00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:08.050
questions for them.

00:04:08.050 --> 00:04:11.670
So, again, November 18 is the
big day when students can

00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:14.110
first start claiming tasks
on the contest.

00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:15.460
CAT ALLMAN: Fantastic.

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:18.350
We hope this interview spurred
your interest in Google

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:24.000
Code-in, and if you are 13
through 17, a student, and

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.450
interested in Open Source
software development, we

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:30.440
really hope you'll come to the
site, learn more about it,

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.200
register and participate.

00:04:32.200 --> 00:04:33.650
It's a lot of fun.

00:04:33.650 --> 00:04:35.080
Thank you so much
for watching.

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.330
Have a great day.
