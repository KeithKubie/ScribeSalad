SHIGERU MIYAGAWA: When
you look at what's

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:10.350
happening in the
world now, you see

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:17.910
that institutions like MIT,
Harvard, Stanford, Berkeley,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.870
they are all producing
digital content

00:00:21.870 --> 00:00:23.880
and sharing it with the world.

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.160
That's something that we
started with OpenCourseWare

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.420
here at MIT in the year 2001.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.470
This is now part of the
profile of a top university.

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:35.460
You do research.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:36.750
You teach your students.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.070
And you share your
material with the world.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.590
What I see also happening
now is that not only

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.380
do you share your digital
educational content

00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.680
with the world, but you
bring it back on campus

00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:53.220
and use that digital
content to transform

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.400
your own residential classroom.

00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:02.430
This is sort of the final
piece of the loop, which

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:08.077
I think MIT is very
serious in accomplishing.

00:01:10.650 --> 00:01:14.040
We have produced
something like 200 MOOCs.

00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:16.050
And they are all used.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.660
Virtually all of them are being
used for residential education,

00:01:21.660 --> 00:01:26.400
so much so that 90% of
undergraduate students

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:33.370
take at least one course
at MIT that uses the MOOC.

00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:36.921
Open Courseware is used widely
by undergraduate students,

00:01:36.921 --> 00:01:38.295
more so than most
people realize.

00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:43.890
I don't think I've ever run
across an MIT undergraduate

00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:46.800
student who had not
heard of Open Courseware.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:50.730
They use it sort of like air.

00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:52.950
They use it to see
if they want to take

00:01:52.950 --> 00:01:54.930
a certain course next semester.

00:01:54.930 --> 00:01:57.690
They use that to catch
up on their own course.

00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:01.290
They use problem sets
from several years

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:05.550
ago just to brush up on
their own study of the course

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.729
that they're taking
and sometimes

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:12.270
just to look at a course they
know they're not going to take,

00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:14.310
because it's outside
of their specialty,

00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.370
but they're just
curious about what's

00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:19.590
being taught in that course.
