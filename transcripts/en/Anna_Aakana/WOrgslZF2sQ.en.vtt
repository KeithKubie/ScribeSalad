00:00:00.297 --> 00:00:01.575
You know what really bugs me?

00:00:01.575 --> 00:00:04.165
(dramatic music)

00:00:04.165 --> 00:00:07.241
(laughs) Okay, okay that was dumb. I'm sorry.

00:00:07.241 --> 00:00:08.714
No, what really bugs me is..

00:00:09.517 --> 00:00:11.905
(dramatic music)

00:00:11.905 --> 00:00:13.127
(laughs)

00:00:13.127 --> 00:00:14.951
You didn't think I'd do it again, did you?

00:00:14.951 --> 00:00:16.776
Okay okay, I'll stop, I'll stop for real, I won't do it again.

00:00:16.776 --> 00:00:18.505
I won--maybe sometime later, but whatever.

00:00:18.505 --> 00:00:19.924
What really bugs me

00:00:19.924 --> 00:00:21.128
is when you're talking to a friend,

00:00:21.128 --> 00:00:23.626
and they drop this at the end of the conversation:

00:00:23.626 --> 00:00:25.773
(gasp) Oh my god, did you hear about John?

00:00:25.773 --> 00:00:26.616
No, what happened?

00:00:26.616 --> 00:00:28.263
Oh my god, it was so cray.

00:00:28.263 --> 00:00:28.954
What was it?

00:00:28.954 --> 00:00:30.886
It's just..heart wrenching stuff.

00:00:30.886 --> 00:00:31.646
What?

00:00:31.646 --> 00:00:32.652
Heart wrenching? No,

00:00:32.652 --> 00:00:33.725
heart shattering.

00:00:33.725 --> 00:00:34.168
WHAT

00:00:34.168 --> 00:00:34.976
HAPPENED?

00:00:34.976 --> 00:00:36.493
Well..

00:00:36.493 --> 00:00:37.587
I'll tell you later.

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.420
What? Why?

00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:41.240
Why can't you just..tell me right now,

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:42.214
while we're talking?

00:00:42.214 --> 00:00:45.680
I mean, I could understand if 
it was like a high-stake situation

00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:46.942
and there was no time..

00:00:46.942 --> 00:00:47.984
Looks like this is it.

00:00:47.984 --> 00:00:48.707
Yeah.

00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:50.703
It's been great working with you, partner.

00:00:50.703 --> 00:00:51.443
You too.

00:00:51.904 --> 00:00:54.176
And now that we're gonna die together,

00:00:54.176 --> 00:00:55.976
there's something I've always wanted to tell you.

00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:57.300
What is it?

00:00:57.302 --> 00:00:59.382
I've always wanted you to know that..

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:00.108
Wait!

00:01:01.140 --> 00:01:03.520
I knew my paper clip quirk would come in handy!

00:01:04.598 --> 00:01:05.252
I'm out!

00:01:05.252 --> 00:01:06.933
Wait, Arden, what were you gonna say?

00:01:06.933 --> 00:01:09.441
Be quiet, I need to concentrate 
if I'm going to defuse this.

00:01:09.441 --> 00:01:10.181
I'll tell you later.

00:01:10.181 --> 00:01:13.533
(beeping)

00:01:13.533 --> 00:01:15.039
Dude, what were you gonna tell me, it's killing me!
Arden: Will you shut up,

00:01:15.039 --> 00:01:17.002
I am trying to defuse this bomb!

00:01:17.002 --> 00:01:19.404
You can't just say that you're gonna say 
something and leave me hanging, dude.

00:01:19.404 --> 00:01:20.564
That is messed up!

00:01:20.564 --> 00:01:22.681
That is messed up, what if we die?!

00:01:22.681 --> 00:01:23.718
You shut up--

00:01:23.718 --> 00:01:24.529
(screams)

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.300
That? I can totally understand that.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.855
But usually when someone says,

00:01:28.855 --> 00:01:30.024
"I'll tell you later,"

00:01:30.024 --> 00:01:33.074
it's when they have time to totally 
tell you what's going on.

00:01:33.074 --> 00:01:36.407
And I don't understand it. Do they just not wanna 
get into a super long story at the moment?

00:01:36.407 --> 00:01:37.565
Do they want to hype it up?

00:01:37.565 --> 00:01:39.625
Do they enjoy the torture aspect of it?

00:01:39.625 --> 00:01:40.242
I know.

00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:40.940
Why?

00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:42.166
I'll tell you later.

00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:44.999
I'm Anna Akana.

00:01:44.999 --> 00:01:46.286
Stay awesome Gotham.

00:01:46.286 --> 00:01:50.182
So, you may have noticed my fabulous 
fashion throughout today's video.

00:01:50.182 --> 00:01:52.392
I wanna say thank you to LootCrate for the loot,

00:01:52.392 --> 00:01:54.308
and for sponsoring today's episode.

00:01:54.308 --> 00:01:57.939

your friends, or even your pets!

00:02:00.494 --> 00:02:03.024
Today's pieces are from their LVLUP crate,

00:02:03.024 --> 00:02:05.328
which delivers epic phantom apparel.

00:02:05.328 --> 00:02:09.938
My favorite is this Mario scarf because 
it matches my cat furniture decor.

00:02:11.739 --> 00:02:12.556
(purrs)

00:02:13.002 --> 00:02:14.871

00:02:14.871 --> 00:02:15.914
