apparently in his day they have wire
electricity and they'd set it off

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:48.410
electricity and they'd set it off
 

00:02:48.410 --> 00:02:51.080

this room I'm sitting in so now you can
 

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:18.470
this room I'm sitting in so now you can
drill down like this and go sideways and

00:03:18.470 --> 00:03:18.480
drill down like this and go sideways and
 

00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:21.740
drill down like this and go sideways and
this has led to irresponsible fracturing

00:03:21.740 --> 00:03:21.750
this has led to irresponsible fracturing
 

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:25.400
this has led to irresponsible fracturing
or fracking and this is where it's not

00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:25.410
or fracking and this is where it's not
 

00:03:25.410 --> 00:03:28.090
or fracking and this is where it's not
inherently a bad idea it just can't be

being able to get away with this
 

00:03:41.220 --> 00:03:44.180
being able to get away with this
irresponsible practice and so the thing

00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:44.190
irresponsible practice and so the thing
 

00:03:44.190 --> 00:03:47.210
