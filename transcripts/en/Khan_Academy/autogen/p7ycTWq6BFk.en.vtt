00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.410
 Let's make the graph of another rational function, 

00:00:03.410 --> 00:00:05.270
 because the examples are never superfluous. 

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:16.470
 Say we have y = x on x ^ 2 - x - 6. 

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:19.000
 First we will decompose the denominator 

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.680
 of multipliers, so that we can find the vertical asymptotes, 

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.880
 if available. 

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.190
 What are these two numbers multiplied 

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.880
 give minus 6 and their sum is minus 1? 

00:00:29.880 --> 00:00:31.810
 They must have different characters. 

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:35.510
 Let me write my xs 

00:00:35.510 --> 00:00:37.740
 a little closer. 

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.470
 One must be positive and the other one negative. 

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:46.210
 2 and 3 are quite close because the distance between them is 1 

00:00:46.210 --> 00:00:47.890
 and I will draw the bigger number, 

00:00:47.890 --> 00:00:49.830
 because I get negative when I gather them. 

00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:53.780
 It seems that 3 x x 2 works. 

00:00:53.780 --> 00:00:55.250
 A minus of 6 is obtained. 

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:57.150
 Minus 3x plus 2x. 

00:00:57.150 --> 00:00:59.830
 Minus 3 x plus 2 x x 

00:00:59.830 --> 00:01:01.970
 minus x, so it works. 

00:01:01.970 --> 00:01:10.140
 This is equal to x on (x + 2) by (x - 3). 

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.590
 And as we saw in the previous video, 

00:01:12.590 --> 00:01:15.590
 because (x + 2) is not abridged by anything 

00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:19.290
 of the numerator and (x - 3) is not abridged by anything 

00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.820
 of the numerator, we know they can 

00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:25.100
 to be used for vertical asymptotes. 

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:30.940
 We have vertical asymptotes when either this or this member is 0, 

00:01:30.940 --> 00:01:33.670
 because in these points the equation would be indefinite. 

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.640
 This is equal to 0 when x is equal to -2 and 

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:41.900
 this is equal to 0 when x is equal to plus 3. 

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.060
 We can try this here. 

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:47.420
 If x is equal to -2 or plus 3, we will get 0 in the denominator 

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:49.310
 and y will be indefinite. 

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:52.940
 Therefore, there is a vertical asymptote at x equal to -2. 

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:59.630
 Here is a vertical asymptote. 

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:01.940
 We will have another vertical asymptote at x = 3. 

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:04.050
 One two Three. 

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:09.410
 Here is the other vertical asymptote. 

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.680
 Now let's see there are horizontal asymptotes. 

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:16.070
 What Happens When x Happens 

00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.290
 very positive or very negative? 

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.090
 As I said before, you just have to see 

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:23.020
 which is the highest rank in the numerator 

00:02:23.020 --> 00:02:26.350
 and the highest degree in the denominator. 

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:29.990
 Note that the highest ranked member in the denominator is x per square, 

00:02:29.990 --> 00:02:33.870
 and that in the numerator is only x. 

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:36.680
 What happens when x is very large? 

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.850
 Imagine we have something like a million 

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.260
 on a million per square, which is 1 per 1 million. 

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:46.470
 These articles are not important here. 

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:48.850
 But this article here will grow 

00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:50.350
 faster than anything else. 

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:52.060
 It contains x per square. 

00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:54.480
 When x increases, this article will grow faster than anything else, 

00:02:54.480 --> 00:02:57.080
 including from this article above. 

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:59.230
 Therefore, it will approach 0. 

00:02:59.230 --> 00:03:03.130
 When the denominator grows faster than the numerator, 

00:03:03.130 --> 00:03:05.340
 the value of the expression is approaching 0. 

00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:11.885
 Therefore, we have a horizontal asymptote at y being equal to 0. 

00:03:11.900 --> 00:03:16.490
 I can draw this as a broken line on the x-axis. 

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:22.530
 Here is the line y = 0. 

00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:25.760
 I repeat that we find this as 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.630
 we look for which member is the highest. 

00:03:26.630 --> 00:03:29.700
 The denominator is of a higher rank, 

00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:31.590
 it will grow faster than the numerator. 

00:03:31.590 --> 00:03:33.250
 You can try with your calculator. 

00:03:33.250 --> 00:03:35.450
 And this is true as we move into a very negative or 

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.120
 very positive direction. 

00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:41.030
 This will overcome this one above. 

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:44.240
 The denominator grows faster than the numerator, 

00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.540
 especially when approaching 0. 

00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:50.570
 We will get smaller fractions. 

00:03:50.570 --> 00:03:55.000
 Just remember, 1 on 10 ... 

00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.450
 What happens when x gets bigger? 

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:01.730
 Let me show you to my calculator. 

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:03.920
 Let x say that x equals 10. 

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:11.570
 10 divided by 10 per square minus 10. 

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.090
 You usually do not have to do this. 

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:15.010
 I just want to show you what logic says. 

00:04:15.010 --> 00:04:15.800
 Oops! 

00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:17.050
 I'm not trying to draw. 

00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:24.460
 Let me get out of here. 

00:04:24.460 --> 00:04:30.400
 If we have 10 on 10 per square minus 10 (again, usually 

00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.800
 you will not have to do that). 

00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.430
 I just want to show you, give you the logic. 

00:04:34.430 --> 00:04:36.670
 Let me put brackets here. 

00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:43.360
 I put brackets 

00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:45.840
 here and here. 

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.830
 We get a small number. 

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:51.970
 What happens when x is even bigger? 

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.110
 Let's make it 100 instead of 10. 

00:04:57.110 --> 00:05:03.040
 Let all 10 of us be 100. 

00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.850
 We put 100 here and what do we get? 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:06.470
 We get even less. 

00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.090
 And if you try with x equal to 1000, the number 

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.100
 it will be even less. 

00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:11.510
 And this is because this article is growing here 

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:13.620
 faster than any other member. 

00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.210
 So we have a horizontal asymptote at y equal to 0. 

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:19.610
 Now that we have drawn the asymptotes, 

00:05:19.610 --> 00:05:21.930
 let's try with some points. 

00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:26.130
 Let's make a small table. 

00:05:26.130 --> 00:05:27.650
 Here is the table. 

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:30.570
 When x is equal to 0, how much is y? 

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:32.950
 x is 0, we have 0 on all this. 

00:05:32.950 --> 00:05:37.200
 0 minus 6, 0 on minus 6 is simply 0. 

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.990
 Let's try when x is 1, 

00:05:39.990 --> 00:05:42.900
 how much is it? 

00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:44.980
 I will write it here - we have 1 on 

00:05:44.980 --> 00:05:48.650
 1 per square minus 1. 

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:52.410
 This is 0, so we have a minus 6. 

00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.910
 And what do we have when x is equal to -1? 

00:05:54.910 --> 00:06:02.000
 When x is equal to -1, we have -1 

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.310
 on -1 per square, which is 1, minus -1. 

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.350
 This is plus 1, so, minus -1, minus 6. 

00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.630
 So what is that? 

00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:22.460
 This is -1, so it will be -1 on 2 

00:06:22.460 --> 00:06:24.400
 minus 6, minus 4. 

00:06:24.400 --> 00:06:28.410
 That would be 1/4, so we'll get it 

00:06:28.410 --> 00:06:29.990
 positive value. 

00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:32.870
 So we have ... let's draw this. 

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:35.130
 Here is minus 1, here somewhere is 1/4. 

00:06:35.130 --> 00:06:36.170
 It's somewhere here. 

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.490
 I will get a darker color. 

00:06:38.490 --> 00:06:43.630
 We had the point (0; 0) and then at x = 1, 

00:06:43.630 --> 00:06:45.600
 we had a minus 1/6. 

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:51.240
 We can continue to put points, 

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:54.150
 but it seems that when we go to the right asymmetry, 

00:06:54.150 --> 00:07:00.040
 we are moving towards infinity. 

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:02.060
 And this should be logical. 

00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.810
 Let's see, we move to 

00:07:04.810 --> 00:07:06.310
 minus 2 on the right. 

00:07:06.310 --> 00:07:12.350
 So, if we put minus 1.9999999, this article 

00:07:12.350 --> 00:07:14.700
 must be a very small positive number. 

00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:18.620
 And this article will be a negative number. 

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.970
 Minuses are shortening. 

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:22.870
 We have a very small positive number in the denominator. 

00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.280
 1 on this gives us a very positive number. 

00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.390
 As we approach the other vertical asymmetry on the left, 

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:33.830
 we will become increasingly negative. 

00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:37.375
 The calculator tells me this because when I tried with 

00:07:37.375 --> 00:07:39.560
 x = 1, I already had a negative value. 

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.530
 But you can imagine with 2.99999, right? 

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:48.580
 Let me draw a bit better. 

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:49.590
 Caught the idea. 

00:07:49.590 --> 00:07:52.520
 If x equals 2,999, we get very close to the asymptote, 

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:55.970
 it will be positive, it will be negative, 

00:07:55.970 --> 00:07:59.250
 this will be positive 

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.510
 and this will be a small number. 

00:08:00.510 --> 00:08:04.430
 So we will have 1 on a very small negative number, 

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.120
 which, I suppose, is a very "negative" number. 

00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:11.520
 This is -1 on a very small number, that is 

00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:13.370
 we will move to minus infinity. 

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:16.810
 Now, let's try some point here and see what happens. 

00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.630
 What happens when x = 4? 

00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:31.910
 When x = 4, we have 4 on 16 minus 4 minus 6. 

00:08:31.910 --> 00:08:32.490
 What is this? 

00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:34.360
 This is 16 minus 10. 

00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:35.034
 That's 6. 

00:08:35.034 --> 00:08:42.419
 So this is equal to 4/6, which equals 2/3. 

00:08:42.419 --> 00:08:46.390
 So at point 4, 2/3 is here, then 1, 2, 3, 4 ... 

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:48.510
 2/3, here's what. 

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:50.870
 It makes me think that I must approach 

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:53.680
 to the horizontal asymmetry when we go further. 

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.330
 Probably that way 

00:08:56.330 --> 00:09:00.130
 we are getting closer to infinity. 

00:09:00.130 --> 00:09:02.250
 Let me draw a bit clearer. 

00:09:02.250 --> 00:09:04.250
 Like this. 

00:09:04.250 --> 00:09:05.730
 You get the idea. 

00:09:05.730 --> 00:09:10.540
 And here we are getting closer to 

00:09:10.540 --> 00:09:13.530
 the horizontal asymmetry as we approach infinity. 

00:09:13.530 --> 00:09:15.530
 This should be a better drawn curve. 

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.230
 I'm messing up here. 

00:09:18.230 --> 00:09:20.170
 This should be a neat curve. 

00:09:20.170 --> 00:09:22.550
 I think you understand. 

00:09:22.550 --> 00:09:25.150
 Now, let's see what happens when x = -3. 

00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:35.110
 When x = -3, we have -3 on -3 per square, 

00:09:35.110 --> 00:09:38.860
 which is 9 minus -3, that is 

00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:42.290
 plus 3 minus 6. 

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:43.770
 How equal is this? 

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:49.380
 This is equal to -3 on ... this is 12 minus 6 on 

00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:55.630
 6, so what is equal to 1/2. So minus 3, 

00:09:55.630 --> 00:09:57.700
 minus 1/2. 

00:09:57.700 --> 00:09:59.120
 Minus 1/2 is here. 

00:09:59.120 --> 00:10:01.670
 So we'll get to the asymptote when 

00:10:01.670 --> 00:10:03.570
 values ​​become very negative. 

00:10:03.570 --> 00:10:07.340
 And we'll probably go straight down, that's when 

00:10:07.340 --> 00:10:10.180
 we are approaching this vertical asymptote here. 

00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:13.270
 You can try with more points if you do not believe me. 

00:10:13.270 --> 00:10:19.350
 But let's draw it to see if we are right. 

00:10:19.350 --> 00:10:36.220
 Our equation is x divided by x ^ 2 - x - 6. 

00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:39.420
 Let's make the chart. 

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:40.730
 Here. 

00:10:40.730 --> 00:10:41.670
 - 

00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:45.930
 That looks good. 

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:48.390
 Asymptote is 0 as we go down. 

00:10:48.390 --> 00:10:49.850
 Vertical asymptote, bam! 

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:52.740
 We go up there, then back down, 

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:53.920
 and then again. 

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:58.550
 Here it looks exactly like our chart. 

00:10:58.550 --> 00:11:01.250
 This calculator behaves strangely, 

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.020
 when we approach those values, 

00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:06.600
 but it has the same general form. 

00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:10.010
 We can narrow the set of function values ​​here, 

00:11:10.010 --> 00:11:11.190
 if we want to make the chart. 

00:11:11.190 --> 00:11:15.600
 Let's set a minimum value of x to 5. 

00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:17.550
 And maximum value 

00:11:17.550 --> 00:11:18.990
 let's also 5. 

00:11:18.990 --> 00:11:20.970
 We're a little rushing here. 

00:11:20.970 --> 00:11:22.520
 Now let's make the chart. 

00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:23.930
 Bam! 

00:11:23.930 --> 00:11:24.900
 Bam! 

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:25.590
 Here! 

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:27.750
 This is the same curve we have drawn here. 

00:11:27.750 --> 00:11:30.010
 I hope you enjoyed it. 

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:30.333
