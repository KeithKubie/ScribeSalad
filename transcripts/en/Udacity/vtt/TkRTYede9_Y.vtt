00:00:00.442 --> 00:00:03.150
I want to conclude this course module with a

00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:06.680
couple of pictures. One showing Xen and guests

00:00:06.680 --> 00:00:08.840
supported on top of it. And this is

00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:12.790
from the original paper which shows what are all

00:00:12.790 --> 00:00:16.740
the resources available. And how they are virtualized

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:18.590
and how guest operating systems may sit on

00:00:18.590 --> 00:00:21.520
top of it. With a similar picture for

00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:26.470
VMware. As you know, Xen is a paravirtualized environment.

00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:29.770
VMware is a fully virtualized environment.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:33.190
And there's a picture showing how VMware

00:00:33.190 --> 00:00:36.270
allows different guests to sit on top

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.550
of its virtualization layer. The main difference

00:00:39.550 --> 00:00:44.090
of virtualization technology from extensible operating system

00:00:44.090 --> 00:00:45.810
that we have seen in the earlier

00:00:45.810 --> 00:00:48.860
course module is, in the case of

00:00:48.860 --> 00:00:52.130
virtualization technology whether we are talking about

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:58.590
para virtualization a la Xen. A full virtualization a la VMware. The focus is

00:00:58.590 --> 00:01:03.360
on protection and flexibility. Performance is important,

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.280
but we are focusing on protection and

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:08.460
flexibility and making sure that we are

00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:11.940
sharing the resources not at the granularity

00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:14.740
of individual applications that may run on

00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:18.160
top of the hardware. But, at the granularity

00:01:18.160 --> 00:01:23.210
of entire operating systems that is running on top of the virtualization layer.
