1
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:06.470
Listening to radiolab radio found W and Y.

2
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.860
N. P. R. How did you even get on to field?

3
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:16.970
I feel like buttons has just become a fixture. How did this happen?

4
00:00:17.060 --> 00:00:20.730
It can boost the blade for me. Let me, let me start. I'm going to start.

5
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:24.570
This was reported a lot of Nassar and today on Radio Lab blockers and I are

6
00:00:24.571 --> 00:00:29.571
bringing Jed and you three wildly different stories about buttons that are

7
00:00:30.511 --> 00:00:31.020
really about

8
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:32.820
<v 1>power and freedom and destruction.</v>

9
00:00:32.890 --> 00:00:37.890
So this all started because I could not convince any of my friends to go to the

10
00:00:41.461 --> 00:00:43.620
elevator history museum with me.

11
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:49.080
There was not a single person out of the eight and a half million people living

12
00:00:49.081 --> 00:00:51.780
in New York who wanted to go to the button museum with wait,

13
00:00:51.781 --> 00:00:54.120
you found one except I'll recall.

14
00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.380
<v 0>I'll go the Annie Fair. Exactly. Okay.</v>

15
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:01.670
Jamie told me never to stop recording but so we go to long island city like walk

16
00:01:01.671 --> 00:01:04.850
around. You think it's right that door right there. I personally can't find it.

17
00:01:04.880 --> 00:01:08.360
We got lost. This street is entirely taxi yellow.

18
00:01:08.361 --> 00:01:13.361
Only thing we saw was a big old boring building covered with with with taxi

19
00:01:13.581 --> 00:01:15.450
signs. We have no interest in taxes.

20
00:01:15.710 --> 00:01:19.010
Do you know if there's a museum in here and we found some guy on the street?

21
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:23.730
Yes there is. Um, you gotta go up to stairs, right? Yeah.

22
00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:28.310
That's great. I'll take you, I'll take me. I'll show you the way. Anyway.

23
00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:32.350
All right. You go along the way down. They go. Left Greg. Nick,

24
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:36.890
a walkway down to the edge. Thank you very much. Aha. Wow.

25
00:01:36.891 --> 00:01:41.570
That's quite a sign. Elevated Museum founded in 2011 by Patrick Carson.

26
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.260
So we open up the door. Wow.

27
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:46.840
We have no idea what's going to be on the other side of this, not the thing.

28
00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:52.400
Whoa. This is different from what? Like it's a large room.

29
00:01:52.630 --> 00:01:57.230
It's a world. Are you building up to something? It's filled with, what is it?

30
00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.930
What stuff? Elevator. Matchbook here.

31
00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.730
Pens or witches and locks. Just random stuff.

32
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.180
Is there things you give the sales meetings? Yeah, the Rosenberg loop. Again,

33
00:02:08.450 --> 00:02:11.330
small breaths. Objects of one kind or another.

34
00:02:11.331 --> 00:02:16.331
And there are these giant paintings of escalators and moving sidewalks and

35
00:02:16.611 --> 00:02:20.360
sitting in a corner. Hi, I'm Leptin across the room.

36
00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.950
We see a guy sitting, he's a, an older guy, Patrick car.

37
00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:28.400
He has his glasses down on his nose and he's in charge of the place.

38
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.080
They can call me if they want to come visit.

39
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:34.910
(718) 361-8683 apparently you're supposed to make an appointment and if I'm

40
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:35.960
going to move, they'll get a song.

41
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.710
Patrick has been the lead singer in a number of bands and he even studied

42
00:02:39.711 --> 00:02:43.400
constitutional law out. This is a man for all seasons. He's like,

43
00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:45.530
he's got so much elevator stuff.

44
00:02:45.531 --> 00:02:48.560
I've been collectors of 11 years old because when you were seven years old,

45
00:02:48.561 --> 00:02:51.710
you walked into an elevator and had a million years old.

46
00:02:51.711 --> 00:02:54.050
I started working with my dad. I went to college,

47
00:02:54.051 --> 00:02:57.950
got a couple of degrees and stayed in the elevator. Never left. I actually,

48
00:02:57.951 --> 00:03:00.700
my first item is over on one of the walls here. Well,

49
00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:02.360
let me show you something up. Bring you over here.

50
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.850
And as we're walking along like a haul of buttons,

51
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:10.780
we kind of inevitably do a series of elevator button panels.

52
00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:13.860
Here's a golden up and down. Here's a bronze up in that, oh,

53
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:18.370
that's a really silver up and down. He has all kinds of antique buttons that,

54
00:03:18.371 --> 00:03:21.760
I mean from just different era. Some is one where you go split.

55
00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:26.230
So this is the genesis, right?

56
00:03:26.460 --> 00:03:31.120
This is where the insults begins and it is an insult because what is about to

57
00:03:31.121 --> 00:03:36.121
happen is he's about to tell us that we are fools and have no power in the world

58
00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:40.430
in which he inhabits. And he does that by pointing to the close door button.

59
00:03:40.431 --> 00:03:44.050
You know when you push in, the door's supposed to close, he says, just says,

60
00:03:44.051 --> 00:03:48.730
matter of fact, it's just about 80% of them are nonfunctional. Oh Wow.

61
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.990
Because they are broken and no one fixed them because they never wired.

62
00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:57.250
They were never, never wired up. Never. Most of the time we don't do it,

63
00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.470
but 80% of them don't work.

64
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:04.150
I just assume they don't where you assume they don't lie. See the time. Yeah,

65
00:04:04.270 --> 00:04:08.410
I saw it. No, no, no, no, no work. No, I cannot be right.

66
00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:09.640
What do you mean you cannot be right?

67
00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:13.780
Have you ever 40 close button that has had, I believe I on the door.

68
00:04:14.290 --> 00:04:17.430
Psychological tool for you. You needed a button to go back to that person,

69
00:04:18.010 --> 00:04:21.670
but that's not the bin. He said also he had also a very fancy reason.

70
00:04:21.730 --> 00:04:24.340
What was his fancy reason? They're extremely intelligence.

71
00:04:24.341 --> 00:04:28.030
All of it is the yellow is actually, remember what happens every day.

72
00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.200
So the elevator system knows that between eight 55 and nine o'clock we get 373

73
00:04:35.561 --> 00:04:37.330
people at an average morning coming in.

74
00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.440
So we're going to return to cause to the main floor as soon as we possibly can.

75
00:04:41.470 --> 00:04:43.360
We're not going to park anything up upstairs,

76
00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:48.400
but it knows that at four 45 it gets 650 people leaving the building.

77
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.820
You get three wheelchairs, you get two old people that Dah Dah, Dah.

78
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:54.580
And so we programmed the timing of the elevator to accommodate the hole.

79
00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:58.030
So all you're doing is screwing up our timing by touching that thing.

80
00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:02.710
I mean you have thousands and thousands of people anxiously trying to urge the

81
00:05:02.711 --> 00:05:04.090
machine to do their will.

82
00:05:04.400 --> 00:05:07.570
Like watching people just keep pressing a stupid button and not know.

83
00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:10.120
I mean this is cruel.

84
00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:13.780
I have to tell you his idea that we would somehow have the authority or the

85
00:05:13.781 --> 00:05:17.920
power to close the door. It was offensive to him. Yeah, no. In my building,

86
00:05:17.921 --> 00:05:20.110
they work. I'm sympathetic to that viewpoint.

87
00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:24.040
Be sympathetic because think of what a building is.

88
00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.040
It's a crazy ass vertical stack of humanity.

89
00:05:27.190 --> 00:05:30.400
How is that going to work if not for beautifully designed systems like the

90
00:05:30.401 --> 00:05:35.350
elevator. This is about freedom. This is about freedom and this is about Sade.

91
00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:36.640
Your head say no.

92
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.670
He then began looking around for some little soup song of hope to give the

93
00:05:41.681 --> 00:05:46.681
Radiolab listeners some tiny bit of power that they can have back in this

94
00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:51.790
otherly fascistic system and you know we found it. You did. We did.

95
00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:55.330
What did you find? We have clothes. We have hacked the close button. Really?

96
00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:58.160
Wait, now I'm suddenly into for the first

97
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.460
<v 2>time I am interested in what? What? What did you discover the next time, Chad,</v>

98
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:05.450
that you walk into an elevator, the door closes and mysteriously,

99
00:06:05.451 --> 00:06:09.650
although you're going to the eighth floor, it stops on five. The door opens.

100
00:06:10.070 --> 00:06:13.040
You appear out. There's nobody there. Yes.

101
00:06:13.190 --> 00:06:18.190
Six endless seconds will roll by leaving you powerless and hapless,

102
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:22.370
but not anymore. Now, here's what you can do. And we checked this,

103
00:06:22.371 --> 00:06:26.180
and it's true. You can put your arm through the door,

104
00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.960
breaking the beam with your arm and then Yank your arm back very suddenly.

105
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.870
That will convince the stupid, stupid,

106
00:06:32.871 --> 00:06:35.600
supine elevator that you have.

107
00:06:35.601 --> 00:06:40.010
Just someone had just entered the elevator and now it will close.

108
00:06:40.980 --> 00:06:45.350
[inaudible] really amazing. Three. Yay. Five seconds off your waiting time.

109
00:06:46.170 --> 00:06:47.730
They will give you that sense of doing. So.

110
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:52.300
<v 0>Yeah, that's 45 minutes of your life. You're welcome.</v>

111
00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:57.533
I should just say,

112
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:01.060
Patrick was actually really awesome guy and everyone should visit the elevator.

113
00:07:01.061 --> 00:07:01.894
His rooms. Yeah.

114
00:07:09.030 --> 00:07:10.380
<v 2>So the next story,</v>

115
00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:16.230
this is the maybe the most valuable button in the world. Hmm. It's not a button.

116
00:07:16.231 --> 00:07:20.940
Exactly. It's, it's the, he was a guy and his name was button. Gwinette.

117
00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:27.210
Why does it button Gwinnette, B u, t, t, O n is that his real name?

118
00:07:27.211 --> 00:07:28.200
That's his real name.

119
00:07:28.370 --> 00:07:32.910
But that's Bobby Livingston from rnr auction house in Boston who is button

120
00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:34.193
Gwinette button.

121
00:07:34.470 --> 00:07:37.650
Gwinnette is one of two signers of the declaration of independence that were

122
00:07:37.651 --> 00:07:41.010
born in England and moved to the United States or move to the colonies.

123
00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:43.260
He is a founding father. He's a founding father.

124
00:07:43.261 --> 00:07:46.530
You've seen his signature thousands of times without realizing it. And,

125
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:49.410
and the thing about that signature, it gets interesting in a minute,

126
00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:50.490
but just to start at the beginning,

127
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:56.140
<v 4>buttoned Gwinnett was born in England in the early 17 hundreds and then he moved</v>

128
00:07:56.141 --> 00:07:57.820
to Georgia in 1765 and he

129
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:02.540
<v 2>bought an island and I believe he began a import export island.</v>

130
00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.530
Yup. St Catherine's island. The truth is he leased it, but whatever.

131
00:08:05.710 --> 00:08:07.450
So he's like a, just a wealthy guy. No button.

132
00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.770
Gwinnett was a serial debtor actually, and he owed everybody.

133
00:08:12.100 --> 00:08:13.450
He owed everybody money.

134
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.720
So he failed in his business and he became a radicalized revolutionary.

135
00:08:19.390 --> 00:08:24.390
And he joined Georgia politics late in the 1760s and when it got to be 1776 in

136
00:08:26.681 --> 00:08:27.514
Philadelphia,

137
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:32.610
he was in independence hall and he signed the Declaration of independence really

138
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:35.590
to the left and below a John Hancock.

139
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:40.600
But then he goes home to Georgia and gets in a duel with this political rival

140
00:08:40.720 --> 00:08:45.720
and is killed in 1777 and then I believe in 1780 his wife passes away leaving

141
00:08:49.091 --> 00:08:50.020
only his daughter,

142
00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:55.500
and then by 1800 his daughter passes away and his lineage is so Gwinnett pass

143
00:08:57.541 --> 00:08:58.860
into history. Yes.

144
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:01.920
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

145
00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:05.380
<v 2>yeah, his signature is on that very important piece of paper. True. True.</v>

146
00:09:05.410 --> 00:09:10.410
Which becomes important because around the 1820s the last of the signers,

147
00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:13.030
the declaration of independence were dying.

148
00:09:14.350 --> 00:09:19.350
So there was a nostalgia for the founding fathers and that's when people began

149
00:09:19.510 --> 00:09:22.150
collecting the signatures that were placed on that document.

150
00:09:22.660 --> 00:09:26.920
So people collected Jefferson and an Adams and a Hancock and they started

151
00:09:26.921 --> 00:09:31.330
thinking, okay, I want a whole set of the 56 men that signed that document.

152
00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.020
People want the set, they want the set for an American.

153
00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:38.530
I don't think there was any more important signature than the signatures that

154
00:09:38.531 --> 00:09:39.850
were placed on that document.

155
00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:45.600
Get them all in a problem arose button Gwinette signatures that were almost

156
00:09:46.001 --> 00:09:49.870
impossible to find. And even now I can a hundred and some odd years later.

157
00:09:49.900 --> 00:09:51.180
One Guy, uh, we,

158
00:09:51.190 --> 00:09:54.900
I went to see his collection and he had a beautiful house in Florida, uh,

159
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:57.190
overlooking the bay. I won't tell you which bay,

160
00:09:57.191 --> 00:10:00.220
but he showed me some great stuff and I said, what else you got? And he goes,

161
00:10:00.221 --> 00:10:03.580
I swear you pushes a button on and a wall begins to rise.

162
00:10:05.860 --> 00:10:10.690
Uh, and on the wall he's got like, you know, incredible. You Know Wilbur, right?

163
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:14.320
George Washington, but I could see in the middle, my eye goes right to it.

164
00:10:14.321 --> 00:10:18.370
The unmistakable signature of button Gwinette is like the centerpiece of this

165
00:10:18.371 --> 00:10:22.210
secret wall that [inaudible] is up. And I go, my goodness,

166
00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.670
you've got to put in Gwinnette. It was pretty amazing.

167
00:10:24.910 --> 00:10:28.420
So this is the autographic equivalent of some really famous diamond, you know,

168
00:10:28.421 --> 00:10:31.450
or something like that. Right. You know, it's the holy grail. Wait,

169
00:10:31.451 --> 00:10:32.710
how many signatures still exist?

170
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.800
There are 50 51 51 known examples in the world.

171
00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:42.790
Most of the things that exist are IOUs. If you have one of these things,

172
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.820
<v 5>what were they worth? Well, I'll tell you this,</v>

173
00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:46.950
it is more valuable than Lincoln.

174
00:10:46.960 --> 00:10:50.320
<v 2>Much more a hundred times more than a blink. And what really,</v>

175
00:10:50.321 --> 00:10:54.010
what about George Washington? Yup. Ben Franklin. Yes. Yes.

176
00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.540
[inaudible] outsells upsells. Ben.

177
00:10:57.740 --> 00:11:02.680
Ben Franklin was a world famous person, but Ben Franklin was a man of letters.

178
00:11:02.681 --> 00:11:05.440
He wrote tons of letters. He was president of Pennsylvania.

179
00:11:05.470 --> 00:11:06.760
He was the ambassador to France.

180
00:11:07.030 --> 00:11:09.900
He wrote and wrote and wrote and signed and sign and sign. So there's

181
00:11:09.910 --> 00:11:12.310
<v 5>Bobby Livingston told us with the, with the exception,</v>

182
00:11:12.311 --> 00:11:17.140
possible exception of William Shakespeare, this guy bought button,

183
00:11:17.250 --> 00:11:20.680
go net, ran up a bunch of debt, did basically nothing else that is like,

184
00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:25.600
he is the most valuable signature in the world

185
00:11:25.670 --> 00:11:29.180
<v 2>today. What makes it extremely hard to complete a set of signers?</v>

186
00:11:29.181 --> 00:11:33.440
The decoration dependence is because of the 51 41 are in libraries or

187
00:11:33.441 --> 00:11:35.540
institutions. And we'll never be able to get it.

188
00:11:35.570 --> 00:11:39.350
So there's only 10 examples in public hands.

189
00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:43.740
<v 5>Hello Sir. Hello Sir. How you doing? Good. Okay. And you checked your,</v>

190
00:11:43.900 --> 00:11:44.950
your bags and everything.

191
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:49.980
So turns out that there are four button Gwinnett's at the,

192
00:11:50.050 --> 00:11:52.390
at the New York Public Library, which is right in their neighborhood.

193
00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:55.450
Closed the, I believe the reading room is still close,

194
00:11:55.451 --> 00:11:59.320
but we're going to a kind of super secret place where you need to ring a bell to

195
00:11:59.321 --> 00:12:03.040
get in. Really? So I, so I, I emailed them up,

196
00:12:03.041 --> 00:12:06.030
I emailed the guy named Thomas Lannon and I work in the men's groups and

197
00:12:06.300 --> 00:12:07.600
archives division at the New York Public Library.

198
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:12.370
He took us into a special room on the top, on the top floor. Ooh. Wow.

199
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:15.810
This is awesome. All by ourselves. We'll just,

200
00:12:15.820 --> 00:12:19.210
I guess we'll put them on the word [inaudible]. I had a wooden,

201
00:12:19.270 --> 00:12:24.270
like a kind of beautiful old wooden table and we have on the table four button

202
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.150
Gwinnett's for wait, hold on. Just, just so I can appreciate,

203
00:12:28.510 --> 00:12:31.330
tell me what one of these is worth. What you don't know until they're sold.

204
00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.470
Cause they're different quality.

205
00:12:32.471 --> 00:12:37.471
But the last one that we know of that was sold here in New York was sold for

206
00:12:41.070 --> 00:12:42.070
$722,500 dollars. I don't,

207
00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:44.350
I'm not in the business of estimating value of things,

208
00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:47.530
but I can say that button. When I autographs at the New York Public Library,

209
00:12:47.531 --> 00:12:52.120
r w classified as splendid, highest ranking, splendid.

210
00:12:52.650 --> 00:12:56.620
They're not, they're not simply um, cut autographs. There are documents signed.

211
00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.720
Okay Fish, look at this. This is the most extravagant, oh wow.

212
00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:03.580
But it has like seals on it like red wax seals.

213
00:13:03.610 --> 00:13:07.050
They might've been like $4 million sitting on that table. We got $4 million.

214
00:13:07.110 --> 00:13:09.130
Right. So for me, the, the impulse,

215
00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:13.330
the impulse I'm having right here is not just putting these in my pocket and

216
00:13:13.331 --> 00:13:16.090
running away. Like the impulse I'm having, and I'm being totally frank here,

217
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:17.830
is that, is it the same impulse I have?

218
00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:20.170
Like you know when you want to pull the fire alarm,

219
00:13:20.171 --> 00:13:23.080
like I just want to just tear these all up right now. Kind of,

220
00:13:23.740 --> 00:13:28.740
I just wanted to take all of these papers that were on this table and just tear

221
00:13:30.281 --> 00:13:33.430
them all the shred. I can't, I can't speak to here. Desire to, to,

222
00:13:33.431 --> 00:13:36.640
to destroy history. And then the guy really looked alarmed, but you really,

223
00:13:36.641 --> 00:13:39.400
you don't really want to tear these up. You have to admit it's just so bad.

224
00:13:39.460 --> 00:13:43.180
Like it's so arbitrarily valuable. Like w like, like I could just,

225
00:13:43.181 --> 00:13:44.320
I could just rip it up.

226
00:13:44.530 --> 00:13:47.530
Like how could it be that valuable if I could just rip it up.

Lots of Nasr and Robert Krulwich are talking buttons.

262
00:16:20.270 --> 00:16:24.380
So we have one more button, Dale. In a way,

263
00:16:24.590 --> 00:16:27.410
this sort of, once we were onto buttons,

264
00:16:27.411 --> 00:16:32.411
this sort of presented itself because it is the most high stakes button.

265
00:16:34.410 --> 00:16:35.191
Yeah, Mr President,

266
00:16:35.191 --> 00:16:40.191
we have a crisis situation that one of our missiles centers a thermo nuclear

267
00:16:40.511 --> 00:16:43.290
button. You want me to tell me a renegade?

268
00:16:43.620 --> 00:16:45.610

<v 3>Okay.</v>

270
00:16:49.610 --> 00:16:51.810
<v 5>Is it a button? I mean, well that's what we want.</v>

271
00:16:51.900 --> 00:16:56.000
We want in Hollywood is a big red button. So we just figured, okay,

272
00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:59.660
let's go find the button that destroys the world.

273
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.200
So we brought in a friend of mine, Alex [inaudible].

274
00:17:03.380 --> 00:17:07.250
He's a historian of all things nuclear weapon related. Yeah.

275
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:11.780
You sat down and the first thing he told us was that there's no button,

276
00:17:11.930 --> 00:17:16.220
no button, no, there has never been a single button. Well wait a second,

277
00:17:16.221 --> 00:17:16.670
like don't.

278
00:17:16.670 --> 00:17:21.650
When you get to like 1952 1953 in ordinary parlance, people say,

279
00:17:21.651 --> 00:17:24.740
well the president has his finger on the button. I mean, I don't know.

280
00:17:24.890 --> 00:17:28.070
Do you have any idea where that phrase comes from? But it's older.

281
00:17:28.071 --> 00:17:29.330
It's much older than the bomb.

282
00:17:29.690 --> 00:17:32.840
Oh [inaudible] so 1910s is when all of this stuff,

283
00:17:33.110 --> 00:17:35.270
hg wells is sort of famous. But there's,

284
00:17:35.271 --> 00:17:39.980
there's all this literature about the crazy scientist who invents a,

285
00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:40.400
again,

286
00:17:40.400 --> 00:17:44.480
a new form of gas that can like kill everybody and he has a button and is it a

287
00:17:44.481 --> 00:17:47.420
red button? I don't know if they say red, but it's definitely a button.

288
00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.000
And according to Alex, by the time develop nuclear weapons,

289
00:17:51.001 --> 00:17:55.080
existing imagery about the scientists can blow up the world using their button

290
00:17:55.350 --> 00:17:58.260
transfers to the president can blow up the world using his button.

291
00:17:59.010 --> 00:18:02.250
And then Alex told us something that we really surprised us.

292
00:18:04.010 --> 00:18:06.870
He said when the u s government dropped those first bombs on Japan,

293
00:18:06.871 --> 00:18:10.050
so the bomb that they drop in Hiroshima,

294
00:18:10.170 --> 00:18:12.300
they didn't take off with the bomb armed.

295
00:18:12.450 --> 00:18:16.650
They took off with the bomb missing a piece. And the missing piece is a,

296
00:18:16.890 --> 00:18:18.510
it's a chunk of uranium.

297
00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.590
And then one of the scientists who was also a military guy,

298
00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.570
crawled into the back of this plane while it was in route, opened up the bomb,

299
00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:29.730
put the missing piece back into it,

300
00:18:29.731 --> 00:18:33.360
and then closed it back up again and turned on all the electrical switches that

301
00:18:33.361 --> 00:18:37.020
said, if we drop you out of the plane, you're going to have to detonate.

302
00:18:37.230 --> 00:18:39.990
It will explode when it's a certain number of feet off the ground.

303
00:18:39.991 --> 00:18:43.860
So pressure will trigger it. And as for finger on the button,

304
00:18:45.050 --> 00:18:47.120
the finger, which belonged to Harry Truman,

305
00:18:47.121 --> 00:18:52.121
president and States was 11 time-zones removed and frankly unaware of the act.

306
00:18:54.110 --> 00:18:56.870
Truman, he didn't issue an order himself.

307
00:18:56.871 --> 00:19:01.250
He sort of approved an order that was already being issued from the secretary of

308
00:19:01.251 --> 00:19:04.010
war to the commanders out there. And it said,

309
00:19:04.520 --> 00:19:07.370
you have to have these special bombs. That's what they called them,

310
00:19:07.371 --> 00:19:10.730
special bombs. And here are your four targets. You can drop them on,

311
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.160
you can drop them on here. Shima you could drop on in Nagasaki,

312
00:19:13.161 --> 00:19:15.280
you can drop them on Kookaburra and you could drop them on. You.

313
00:19:15.650 --> 00:19:18.920
Gotta basically says at any day after August 3rd, feel free to drop some off.

314
00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:23.750
What he said. Here's a couple of different options.

315
00:19:23.751 --> 00:19:28.610
Choose cheers and bombs. Here's some cities, here's some days, go for it.

316
00:19:28.790 --> 00:19:33.140
No Way. Other than that, the only considerations are operational.

317
00:19:33.141 --> 00:19:36.890
So the bombing order says you have to be able to see the target before you drop

318
00:19:36.891 --> 00:19:39.290
it. And uh, that's it. Wow.

319
00:19:39.320 --> 00:19:42.570
One of the interesting things that I found out later, there was a,

320
00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:47.620
a town called CoQuora and that was the plan B town or subsidy rather,

321
00:19:49.860 --> 00:19:51.710
uh, for Hiroshima. But,

322
00:19:51.711 --> 00:19:54.290
but the weather that day happened to be good in Hiroshima.

323
00:19:54.291 --> 00:19:57.520
So they dropped it there and then the next time it was,

324
00:19:57.550 --> 00:20:01.970
that was actually the plan, a city for Nagasaki. But the weather was bad there.

325
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:04.910
And so then they, they, they bombed Nagasaki. But so this, this,

326
00:20:05.150 --> 00:20:07.430
the city of CoQuora got got spared twice,

327
00:20:07.431 --> 00:20:11.900
like so close and so Truman doesn't even know he,

328
00:20:11.901 --> 00:20:14.670
he gets told, oh by the way we dropped the bomb yesterday.

329
00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.750
You mean when the bomb dropped in Hiroshima? He had no idea. No erosion.

330
00:20:18.820 --> 00:20:21.690
He didn't know his room. No. What day? The second bomb,

331
00:20:21.691 --> 00:20:25.110
he seems to have been caught off guard and he actually issues,

332
00:20:25.111 --> 00:20:26.850
this is his only way of getting involved.

333
00:20:26.851 --> 00:20:31.851
He issues an order which says stop dropping atomic bombs until I tell you to,

334
00:20:33.030 --> 00:20:36.450
I feel like if you're a president and you're going to do that to that many

335
00:20:36.451 --> 00:20:40.440
people you see, I feel like you should be directly responsible.

336
00:20:40.441 --> 00:20:42.000
It should not be an arbitrary decision.

337
00:20:42.390 --> 00:20:46.500
Like I kind of want a button in this case. No, no, no, no.

338
00:20:46.710 --> 00:20:50.320
You actually want there to be a button, right? You could bump up button.

339
00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:52.450
A button is too easy, right?

340
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:55.960
You don't want it to be easy enough that you set your coffee down on the Oval

341
00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.700
Office table and like kill the world. Right?

342
00:20:57.701 --> 00:21:00.480
Like obviously nobody wants to do that. Nobody wants to be that.

343
00:21:00.580 --> 00:21:02.710
And I think it's, you know,

344
00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:05.110
I have to admit when you first are pitching the button thing,

345
00:21:05.111 --> 00:21:07.570
I was thinking where are they going to go with this? How is this going to work?

346
00:21:08.020 --> 00:21:11.770
And the more I was thinking about it, it's sort of a deep concept, right?

347
00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:16.800
It's about the ease in which you could actually destroy all of civilization

348
00:21:17.140 --> 00:21:21.130
because of the technology which you could not do in the 19th century.

349
00:21:21.131 --> 00:21:23.920
You could not do with Gangas Kahn. He could do a lot of damage,

350
00:21:23.921 --> 00:21:27.880
but he could not kill, you know, all the people in the world.

351
00:21:29.230 --> 00:21:29.290
<v 9>[inaudible]</v>

352
00:21:29.290 --> 00:21:31.330
<v 7>the button is the symbol of how easy that is.</v>

353
00:21:31.900 --> 00:21:35.800
And the reason this becomes kind of crucial as we now are moving through the

354
00:21:35.801 --> 00:21:36.634
fifties and

355
00:21:43.030 --> 00:21:45.690
the early sixties, the United States, uh, is in a face to face with,

356
00:21:45.740 --> 00:21:47.860
with Khrushchev over at the Strip and missiles.

357
00:21:48.550 --> 00:21:51.890
<v 5>Normally it know what's going on. It's all in the vein of non Bam readiness</v>

358
00:21:52.270 --> 00:21:56.080
<v 7>and the world gets you really, really, really close to annihilation.</v>

359
00:21:56.110 --> 00:21:59.170
The way that it works at this time is that the president has an assistant

360
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:04.070
<v 5>Terry Guy who has all the nuclear codes in a briefcase,</v>

361
00:22:04.150 --> 00:22:06.780
a handcuffed to the assistant and the assistant.

362
00:22:06.781 --> 00:22:08.040
If the president is in the bathroom,

363
00:22:08.041 --> 00:22:10.140
the assistant is outside the door in the corridor.

364
00:22:10.141 --> 00:22:13.740
If this president is at a football game at all times. So weirdly the,

365
00:22:14.090 --> 00:22:18.330
the suitcase is called the football and I believe the page with the nuclear

366
00:22:18.331 --> 00:22:20.220
launch codes on it is called the biscuit

367
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:28.190
y. I have no idea where it got the name. So it's the sixties

368
00:22:28.360 --> 00:22:30.880
<v 7>things between the u s and the Soviet Union are very tense.</v>

369
00:22:30.970 --> 00:22:33.010
And there are generals on the joint chiefs,

370
00:22:33.011 --> 00:22:36.970
Curtis Lemay among them who are yeah, who are very,

371
00:22:36.971 --> 00:22:39.820
who are not at all troubled by the possibility that this would be a weapon they

372
00:22:39.821 --> 00:22:43.510
would use. And they advocated very specifically and very specific case.

373
00:22:43.511 --> 00:22:46.990
So even though there are no buttons and there are all these codes,

374
00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:50.770
people are still worried at the time about just how easy it would be for the

375
00:22:50.771 --> 00:22:52.570
president to launch a nuclear

376
00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.530
<v 5>right. So in one guy in particular, this Guy Roger Fisher's,</v>

377
00:22:56.560 --> 00:23:00.250
this sort of academic policy guy, he's a Harvard law school professor.

378
00:23:00.251 --> 00:23:04.690
He advised secretaries of state on the Iran hostage crisis on the Israel Egypt

379
00:23:04.930 --> 00:23:05.740
peace accord. He,

380
00:23:05.740 --> 00:23:10.740
he definitely had the ear of the Pentagon and he was troubled by this idea that,

381
00:23:11.770 --> 00:23:12.100
you know,

382
00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:17.100
the president could very dispassionately start nuclear war until we proposed

383
00:23:17.731 --> 00:23:19.270
this idea. I'll jump in.

384
00:23:19.300 --> 00:23:23.530
The notion comes from his long interest in reducing the risk of war.

385
00:23:23.590 --> 00:23:26.890
Roger Fisher passed away, but we were able to talk to his two sons.

386
00:23:26.950 --> 00:23:29.920
I'm Elliott Fischer, I'm a professor at Dartmouth and I'm Peter Fisher.

387
00:23:29.921 --> 00:23:32.470
I'm a senior fellow at the Tuck School of business at Dartmouth.

388
00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.770
So his solution to this, and by the way,

389
00:23:35.771 --> 00:23:39.120
this would be just in the case of a of a u s surprise attacks,

390
00:23:39.130 --> 00:23:41.140
what's called a first strike, was to,

391
00:23:41.141 --> 00:23:43.900
instead of having all the codes be just in a suitcase,

392
00:23:44.110 --> 00:23:48.680
this idea was to get a volunteer who would have the codes put under their heart.

393
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:53.960
You embed the codes in some sort of capsule and the guy's heart surgically and

394
00:23:53.961 --> 00:23:57.290
he'd carry around a briefcase with a knife in it, a butcher knife,

395
00:23:58.010 --> 00:24:01.850
and if the president ever felt the urge to fire off the missiles,

396
00:24:01.910 --> 00:24:06.350
he has to go to the guy and say, well, now it's time. Give me the knife,

397
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.090
and then you would have to take the knife and

398
00:24:10.550 --> 00:24:12.080
drive it into the guy's chest.

399
00:24:12.110 --> 00:24:15.470
The president has to chop out this code from the sky's heart.

400
00:24:15.500 --> 00:24:18.530
The president would have to kill someone and pull the code out of their body

401
00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:23.450
that he would have to first kill one person in order to get at the codes that

402
00:24:23.451 --> 00:24:25.100
would let him kill millions of people.

403
00:24:25.250 --> 00:24:27.830
He has to look at someone and realize what death is.

404
00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:32.480
Fischer writes a what an innocent death is blood on the White House carpet.

405
00:24:33.230 --> 00:24:34.700
It's reality brought home.

406
00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:37.700
Fisher then says that he suggested this to friends in the Pentagon and their

407
00:24:37.701 --> 00:24:40.880
reply was, Mike God, that's terrible. Having to kill someone,

408
00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:44.390
distort the president's judgment. He might never push the button.

409
00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:48.200
That's the whole point. Yes. The strongest objection is it might work.

410
00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:51.800
But even now I think, you know, Gosh,

411
00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:56.090
not a crazy idea at all to have the president be,

412
00:24:56.540 --> 00:25:00.710
if they're going to pull the trigger and blow the world up, kill one person.

413
00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:03.590
Cause you're just about to kill tens of millions,

414
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:07.700
mostly innocent people and the button is just too easy.

415
00:25:07.970 --> 00:25:12.890
So we'll just make it harder. Buttons too easy. Exactly. Yeah.

416
00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:15.293
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

417
00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.830
<v 5>yeah. The butcher knife is the ultimate anti-pop</v>

418
00:25:23.170 --> 00:25:27.220
but how you can find a guy to put, uh, the codes inside his heart. I, I would,

419
00:25:27.250 --> 00:25:29.680
I would volunteer. I would volunteer to be that guy. Really,

420
00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:31.790
you would totally second at a volunteer.

421
00:25:32.230 --> 00:25:37.230
You wouldn't volunteer to be stabbed in the heart by the president of the United

422
00:25:37.660 --> 00:25:40.000
States. You know what I would do? I would make like,

423
00:25:40.290 --> 00:25:43.600
I'd be best friends with the president. We would take walks,

424
00:25:43.601 --> 00:25:48.040
we would go swimming together. It would be great. We'd be best friends. I would,

425
00:25:48.150 --> 00:25:48.580
I would,

426
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:53.500
that would be my mission would be to make it as hard as humanly possible for him

427
00:25:53.501 --> 00:25:54.334
to carve them.

428
00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:01.933
<v 3>[inaudible]</v>

429
00:26:05.720 --> 00:26:06.553
<v 10>[inaudible]</v>

430
00:26:07.370 --> 00:26:10.170
<v 5>okay. We have some thank you's to make here. Why don't you go ahead. All right.</v>

431
00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:10.880
Uh,

432
00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:14.510
first thank you to Catherine kill a Chatzky of the elevator historical society

436
00:26:23.541 --> 00:26:26.240
us understand what goes on among, uh, autograph collectors.

437
00:26:26.300 --> 00:26:31.300
Thank you to the very indulgent New York Public Library Archives and manuscripts

438
