00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:04.250
We're on problem 13.

00:00:04.250 --> 00:00:07.140
A company sells boxes of
balloons in which the balloons

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:09.260
are red, green, or blue.

00:00:09.260 --> 00:00:12.030
Luann purchased-- that
doesn't sound like a

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.020
name related to me.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:16.090
Luann purchased a box of
balloons in which 1/3

00:00:16.090 --> 00:00:17.340
of them were red.

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:24.250
If there were 1/2 as many green
balloons in the box as

00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:29.190
red ones-- so green is
equal to 1/2 red.

00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.250
Fair enough.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:32.332
Green is equal to 1/2 red.

00:00:32.332 --> 00:00:34.380
There's 1/2 as many green
balloons in the box as red

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:43.350
ones, and 18 balloons were blue,
how many balloons were

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:44.600
in the box?

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:48.550
OK, so this is fascinating.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:52.120
So 1/3 are red.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.050
And then the green is 1/2 as
many as the red, right?

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:58.370
So if 1/3 of them are red, how
may are going to be green?

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:00.270
Well, 1/2 of the 1/3, right?

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:07.080
So we know that 1/6 are
going to be green.

00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:08.330
How did I get 1/6?

00:01:10.500 --> 00:01:12.860
Let's say there's
10 red, right?

00:01:12.860 --> 00:01:15.950
And 10 is 1/3, then there's
going to be-- let's say

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.280
there's 30 balloons.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:19.400
1/3 is red, so then it's 10.

00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:22.500
So green's going to be 1/2 of
that, so it'd be 5/30 or 1/6.

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.710
So whatever the number is,
1/3 are red, 1/2 of

00:01:25.710 --> 00:01:27.350
that, or 1/6, are green.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:29.180
And there are 18 blue.

00:01:29.180 --> 00:01:30.290
So what can we do now?

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.480
Well, let's figure
out what fraction

00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:33.020
would have to be blue.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:35.630
We know that 1/3 are
red 1/6 are green.

00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:36.760
What's left over?

00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:41.110
So what's 1 minus
1/3 minus 1/6?

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:44.480
This will tell us how many blue,
what fraction of the

00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:45.870
balloons have to be blue.

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:49.860
So that equals-- let's make 6
the common denominator, right?

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:53.020
1 is equal to 6/6 minus 1/3.

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:56.180
That's equal to 2/6 minus 1/6.

00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:00.170
So that's 6 minus 2 minus 1.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:03.130
So that's 3/6 are blue, right?

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:05.010
And I just subtracted the
fraction that are red and I

00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.240
subtracted the fraction that
are green from the whole.

00:02:08.240 --> 00:02:13.020
And so I get 3/6, or
1/2, are blue.

00:02:13.020 --> 00:02:15.070
So 1/2 of the balloons in
the container, or in

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:16.430
the box, are blue.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.300
And they want to know how many
balloons are in the box?

00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:21.950
Well, there are 18 blue, and
that's 1/2 of all of the

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:23.270
balloons, right?

00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:28.520
So 18 is equal to 1/2 of
all of the balloons.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:31.380
Multiply both sides by 2, you
get 36 is equal to x.

00:02:31.380 --> 00:02:32.410
And you know that.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.570
18 is 1/2 of something,
then the total number

00:02:34.570 --> 00:02:36.000
of balloons is 36.

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:36.810
That's our answer.

00:02:36.810 --> 00:02:45.710
Next problem, 14.

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.460
The three distinct points P,
Q, and R lie on line L, OK?

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:54.080
The four distinct points S, T,
U, V lie on a different line

00:02:54.080 --> 00:02:55.360
that is parallel to L.

00:02:55.360 --> 00:02:57.080
What is the total number of
different lines that can be

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:03.610
drawn so that each line contains
exactly two of the

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.860
seven points.

00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.060
OK, I see what they're saying.

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:11.330
So let's draw the first
line, P, Q, and R.

00:03:14.770 --> 00:03:21.560
So let me just draw the two
lines first. So the first line

00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:23.150
is line P, Q, and R.

00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:31.735
And then the second line
is S, T, U, and V.

00:03:31.735 --> 00:03:38.080
So then we have S,
T, U, and V.

00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:40.640
And this line is parallel
to this line, right?

00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:42.540
They're parallel, so they're
never going to

00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.420
intersect each other.

00:03:44.420 --> 00:03:47.170
OK, what is the total number of
different lines that can be

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:50.040
drawn so that each line
intersects exactly two of the

00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:50.710
seven points?

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:54.300
So you can't even intersect
three of this.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.950
Well, you can, only if you
go through that line.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.860
So what is the total number of
different lines that can be

00:03:59.860 --> 00:04:06.520
drawn so that each line contains
exactly two of the

00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:06.800
seven points?

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:07.390
Right.

00:04:07.390 --> 00:04:08.020
So that's interesting.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:09.670
So you can't count these
lines, right?

00:04:09.670 --> 00:04:11.030
Because these lines
have three.

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.590
This line has three of the seven
points, and this line

00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:15.040
has four of the seven points.

00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:17.160
So those can't be it, because
it says exactly two.

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:19.000
You can't have even three
of the points.

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:19.920
Sp what are they?

00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:26.260
Well, P can go to four
points, right?

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:28.890
I mean, I could just
count them out.

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:33.310
P can go to four points, Q can
be connected with four points,

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.360
and R can be connected
with four points, so

00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.120
it should be 12.

00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:37.750
And if you don't know what
I'm saying, let me

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.230
just draw it out.

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:43.380
P could be this line,
one, two.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:46.160
Sorry, that one wasn't
drawn well.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:53.400
One, two, three, four.

00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:03.300
One, two, three, four, and
then one, two, three.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.240
Well, that's kind of a
nice-looking shape there.

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.540
So 4 plus 4 plus 4 is 12, so
there's 12 possible lines that

00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:12.880
intersect exactly two of
these seven points.

00:05:12.880 --> 00:05:19.585
Next problem, problem 15.

00:05:19.585 --> 00:05:21.430
I'm still using the line tool.

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:23.260
OK, problem 15.

00:05:23.260 --> 00:05:31.150
If 2 to the x plus 2 to the x
plus 2 to the x plus-- how

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:31.990
many of these are there?

00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:35.090
There's four of them-- plus 2
to the x is equal to 2 the

00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.400
seventh, what is
the value of x?

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.790
So how many of these
are there?

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:43.210
There's one, two, three, four,
which I had to figure out

00:05:43.210 --> 00:05:44.720
while I was drawing it.

00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.430
So there's four.

00:05:46.430 --> 00:05:48.990
We're essentially adding to the
x four times, so this is

00:05:48.990 --> 00:05:53.520
the same thing as saying 4
times 2 to the x, right?

00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:55.540
Because we have 2 to
the x four times:

00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.720
one, two, three, four.

00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.450
So this is the same thing as
this: 4 times 2 to the x.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:03.490
And that equals 2
to the seventh.

00:06:03.490 --> 00:06:07.460
What's 4 written as base 2?

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.740
That's the same thing
as 2 squared, right?

00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:11.063
Whenever you see these problems
and you have two

00:06:11.063 --> 00:06:13.310
different bases, try to see if
you can convert them all to

00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:13.730
the same base.

00:06:13.730 --> 00:06:17.810
So that's 2 squared plus-- 2
squared times 2 to the x is

00:06:17.810 --> 00:06:19.930
equal to 2 to the seventh.

00:06:19.930 --> 00:06:22.380
2 squared times 2 to the x,
that's the same thing as 2 to

00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:24.850
the x plus 2.

00:06:24.850 --> 00:06:27.230
That equals 2 to the seventh.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.660
So x plus 2 must equal 7.

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:31.600
x plus 2 is equal to 7.

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.190
x is equal to 5.

00:06:33.190 --> 00:06:34.440
And we are done.

00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:43.030
Next problem, problem 16.

00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:46.560
Each of five people had a blank
card on which they wrote

00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:48.280
a positive integer.

00:06:48.280 --> 00:06:52.350
If the average of these integers
is 15, what is the

00:06:52.350 --> 00:06:53.990
greatest possible integers
that can be

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:56.260
on one of the cards?

00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:57.720
This is fascinating.

00:06:57.720 --> 00:07:02.930
So essentially, they're saying
you have five positive

00:07:02.930 --> 00:07:05.310
integers and their
average is 15.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.450
What is the greatest possible
integer that could be among

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:09.780
these cards?

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:13.500
So think of it this way: the
sum of the five integers is

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.760
going to be what?

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:19.340
So let's say it's x1
plus x2 plus x3

00:07:19.340 --> 00:07:23.090
plus x4 plus x5, right?

00:07:23.090 --> 00:07:27.470
All of them over 5 is
equal to 15, right?

00:07:27.470 --> 00:07:29.060
That's what they told us.

00:07:29.060 --> 00:07:33.940
The average of the t numbers is
15, so the sum x1 plus x2

00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:37.960
plus x3 plus x4 plus x5
is equal to what?

00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.940
5 times 15, that's 75.

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:43.640
5 times 10 is 50 plus--
OK, that's 75.

00:07:43.640 --> 00:07:46.620
So the sum of the integers
are going to be 75.

00:07:46.620 --> 00:07:51.510
And so we want to know what the
largest one of these, the

00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.900
greatest possible
integer here.

00:07:52.900 --> 00:07:54.540
So let's just say that
this is what we're

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:55.240
trying to figure out.

00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.530
Let's try to maximize this
number here, x5.

00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:01.670
If we want this number to be
as large as possible, these

00:08:01.670 --> 00:08:05.080
numbers have to be as small
as possible, right?

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:07.430
And you could subtract these
numbers from the other side.

00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:14.770
You could say x5 is equal to 75
minus x1 minus x2 minus x3

00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:16.720
minus x4, right?

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:18.970
And we're going to try to
maximize this number.

00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:19.880
And then we're going to say
that's going to be the

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.160
largest.

00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:23.280
So if this is the largest, we
want to subtract as small a

00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.950
number as possible
here, here, here.

00:08:24.950 --> 00:08:26.420
And what are the constraints?

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:29.860
They have to be positive
integers.

00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.510
So each of these numbers have
to be greater than zero and

00:08:32.510 --> 00:08:33.320
have to be integers.

00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.430
So we want them to be as
small as possible, so

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:36.710
let's make them 1.

00:08:36.710 --> 00:08:41.780
So let's say it's 75 minus 1
minus 1 minus 1 minus 1.

00:08:41.780 --> 00:08:45.350
That's 75 minus 4,
which equals 71.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:47.730
So that's the greatest
possible value

00:08:47.730 --> 00:08:50.240
of one of the integers.

00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.320
And I have a minute left and do
problems. No, I'd better do

00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:54.350
it in another video.

00:08:54.350 --> 00:08:56.300
So I'll see you in
the next video.
