the problem 10 before you might have
 

00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:05.490
the problem 10 before you might have
noticed that it will not work on all

00:02:05.490 --> 00:02:05.500
noticed that it will not work on all
 

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.790
noticed that it will not work on all
devices and it's I don't know how

00:02:08.790 --> 00:02:08.800
devices and it's I don't know how
 

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:11.910
devices and it's I don't know how
actually how official it is but if you

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:11.920
actually how official it is but if you
 

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:14.670
actually how official it is but if you
want to use it you should make sure that

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:14.680
want to use it you should make sure that
 

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:15.470
want to use it you should make sure that
you have

00:02:15.470 --> 00:02:15.480
you have
 

00:02:15.480 --> 00:02:17.390
you have
kind of a fallback option to what you're

00:02:17.390 --> 00:02:17.400
kind of a fallback option to what you're
 

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.710
kind of a fallback option to what you're
doing so you can use the crop intent um

00:02:20.710 --> 00:02:20.720
doing so you can use the crop intent um
 

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.289
doing so you can use the crop intent um
but you still have have to have a

00:02:24.289 --> 00:02:24.299
but you still have have to have a
 

00:02:24.299 --> 00:02:26.809
but you still have have to have a
fallback solution if this is not working

00:02:26.809 --> 00:02:26.819
fallback solution if this is not working
 

00:02:26.819 --> 00:02:29.660
fallback solution if this is not working

same case and essentially what Diane

00:03:59.420 --> 00:03:59.430
same case and essentially what Diane
 

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:02.780
same case and essentially what Diane
hack bonds kind of stated is that if you

00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:02.790
hack bonds kind of stated is that if you
 

00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.220
hack bonds kind of stated is that if you
have an application in the foreground

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:04.230
have an application in the foreground
 

00:04:04.230 --> 00:04:06.920
have an application in the foreground
and then you keep on creating activity

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:06.930
and then you keep on creating activity
 

00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:09.559
and then you keep on creating activity
after activity essentially you'll get to

00:04:09.559 --> 00:04:09.569
after activity essentially you'll get to
 

00:04:09.569 --> 00:04:10.610
after activity essentially you'll get to
a point where you'll run out of memory

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:10.620
a point where you'll run out of memory
 

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:12.979
a point where you'll run out of memory
and the activities won't be played

00:04:12.979 --> 00:04:12.989
and the activities won't be played
 

00:04:12.989 --> 00:04:14.390
and the activities won't be played
because the application is in the

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:14.400
because the application is in the
 

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:17.900
because the application is in the
foreground so essentially the best way

00:04:17.900 --> 00:04:17.910
foreground so essentially the best way
 

00:04:17.910 --> 00:04:19.610
foreground so essentially the best way
to get around this was to start using

00:04:19.610 --> 00:04:19.620
to get around this was to start using
 

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.409
to get around this was to start using
fragments and essentially that where you

00:04:21.409 --> 00:04:21.419
fragments and essentially that where you
 

00:04:21.419 --> 00:04:23.180
fragments and essentially that where you
can start managing memory itself because

00:04:23.180 --> 00:04:23.190
can start managing memory itself because
 

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:25.490
can start managing memory itself because
you're essentially able to swap out the

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:25.500
you're essentially able to swap out the
 

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:27.720
you're essentially able to swap out the
fragment to remove them etc

00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:27.730
fragment to remove them etc
 

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:30.450
fragment to remove them etc
sort of managing things that way I think

00:04:30.450 --> 00:04:30.460
sort of managing things that way I think
 

00:04:30.460 --> 00:04:33.300
sort of managing things that way I think
it's slightly ambiguous in the

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.310
it's slightly ambiguous in the
 

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.730
it's slightly ambiguous in the
documentation in terms of whether the

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:35.740
documentation in terms of whether the
 

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:37.560
documentation in terms of whether the
activities will be cleared when they're

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:37.570
activities will be cleared when they're
 

00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:39.150
activities will be cleared when they're
just in the background even though the

00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:39.160
just in the background even though the
 

00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:40.530
just in the background even though the
applications of the foreground or not

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:40.540
applications of the foreground or not
 

00:04:40.540 --> 00:04:41.850
applications of the foreground or not
and I think that's where the confusion

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:41.860
and I think that's where the confusion
 

00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:44.580
and I think that's where the confusion
has come about so yeah but you have to

00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:44.590
has come about so yeah but you have to
 

00:04:44.590 --> 00:04:46.470
has come about so yeah but you have to
be very careful if you're running in the

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:46.480
be very careful if you're running in the
 

00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:48.180
be very careful if you're running in the
foreground and creating activity over

00:04:48.180 --> 00:04:48.190
foreground and creating activity over
 

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:51.690
foreground and creating activity over
activity over activity I think this is

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:51.700
activity over activity I think this is
 

00:04:51.700 --> 00:04:53.700
activity over activity I think this is
kind of an architectural problem this is

00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:53.710
kind of an architectural problem this is
 

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:56.880
kind of an architectural problem this is
I also wide again said use a fragment

00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:56.890
I also wide again said use a fragment
 

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:59.040
I also wide again said use a fragment
API because you don't want to create a

00:04:59.040 --> 00:04:59.050
API because you don't want to create a
 

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:02.160
API because you don't want to create a
new activity every time or what you can

00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:02.170
new activity every time or what you can
 

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:05.220
new activity every time or what you can
do is you can handle at a stag you can

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:05.230
do is you can handle at a stag you can
 

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:09.120
do is you can handle at a stag you can
use flex like single top and grip

00:05:09.120 --> 00:05:09.130
use flex like single top and grip
 

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:11.430
use flex like single top and grip
refresh the views refresh the adapters

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:11.440
refresh the views refresh the adapters
 

00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:16.170

um yes but I think this is how how you

00:05:16.170 --> 00:05:16.180
um yes but I think this is how how you
 

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:20.130
um yes but I think this is how how you
should approach yeah like an au pair but

00:05:20.130 --> 00:05:20.140
should approach yeah like an au pair but
 

00:05:20.140 --> 00:05:23.460
should approach yeah like an au pair but
is how you Jen should approach the thing

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:23.470
is how you Jen should approach the thing
 

00:05:23.470 --> 00:05:26.760
is how you Jen should approach the thing
so and and to know if your applications

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:26.770
so and and to know if your applications
 

00:05:26.770 --> 00:05:28.500
so and and to know if your applications
in a background the framework will be

00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:28.510
in a background the framework will be
 

00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:32.820
in a background the framework will be
able to to kill your your activity but

00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:32.830
able to to kill your your activity but
 

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:34.050
able to to kill your your activity but
not if we're running in the foreground

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.060
not if we're running in the foreground
 

00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:37.200
not if we're running in the foreground
so yeah and that was for moon it a an

00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.210
so yeah and that was for moon it a an
 

00:05:37.210 --> 00:05:38.430
so yeah and that was for moon it a an

00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:42.130
Diane Hank but if Diane Hackman says
 

00:05:42.130 --> 00:05:44.910
Diane Hank but if Diane Hackman says
it's true then probably go word over

00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:44.920

think the ability to reply to comments

00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:55.180
think the ability to reply to comments
 

00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:57.270
think the ability to reply to comments
will be added to developers so again

00:05:57.270 --> 00:05:57.280
will be added to developers so again
 

00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.740
will be added to developers so again

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:05.470
one celebration yeah um your question
 

00:07:05.470 --> 00:07:07.670
one celebration yeah um your question
was the one with a UI Automator I see um

00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:07.680
was the one with a UI Automator I see um
 

00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:11.010
was the one with a UI Automator I see um
yeah we still don't have any news on

00:07:11.010 --> 00:07:11.020
yeah we still don't have any news on
 

00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:14.600
yeah we still don't have any news on
that I saw you open up a different one

00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:14.610
that I saw you open up a different one
 

00:07:14.610 --> 00:07:17.340

it should not happen like I said last

00:07:17.340 --> 00:07:17.350
it should not happen like I said last
 

00:07:17.350 --> 00:07:19.800
it should not happen like I said last
week but we don't have an answer for you

00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:19.810

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:24.360
week but we don't have an answer for you
ready I'm sorry um yes should we take on

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:24.370
ready I'm sorry um yes should we take on
 

00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:27.840
ready I'm sorry um yes should we take on
the private api key question let's do it

00:07:27.840 --> 00:07:27.850
the private api key question let's do it
 

00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.180
the private api key question let's do it
um yeah this is also something that's

00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:30.190
um yeah this is also something that's
 

00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:33.660
um yeah this is also something that's
very sensitive I think because you

00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:33.670
very sensitive I think because you
 

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:37.010
very sensitive I think because you
should obviously protect your API keys

00:07:37.010 --> 00:07:37.020
should obviously protect your API keys
 

00:07:37.020 --> 00:07:40.920
should obviously protect your API keys
so what should you do about it there's a

00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:40.930
so what should you do about it there's a
 

00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:43.710
so what should you do about it there's a
couple of things that you could do there

00:07:43.710 --> 00:07:43.720
couple of things that you could do there
 

00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:45.930
couple of things that you could do there
was in general if you want to have have

00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:48.990
was in general if you want to have have
a read there's a blog post on the

00:07:48.990 --> 00:07:49.000
a read there's a blog post on the
 

00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.240
a read there's a blog post on the
Android developers blog on secure and

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:51.250
Android developers blog on secure and
 

00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.570
Android developers blog on secure and
passwords and maybe use some advice from

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:54.580
passwords and maybe use some advice from
 

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.660
passwords and maybe use some advice from
there and apply it to secure your API

00:07:57.660 --> 00:07:57.670
there and apply it to secure your API
 

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.500
there and apply it to secure your API
key but in general you should think you

00:08:01.500 --> 00:08:01.510
key but in general you should think you
 

00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:03.450
key but in general you should think you
should think about how sensitive is it

00:08:03.450 --> 00:08:03.460
should think about how sensitive is it
 

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:06.360
should think about how sensitive is it

this will be accessible so you can if

00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:33.580
this will be accessible so you can if
 

00:08:33.580 --> 00:08:35.339

you really have to protect your API key

00:08:35.339 --> 00:08:35.349
you really have to protect your API key
 

00:08:35.349 --> 00:08:37.320
you really have to protect your API key

00:08:45.490 --> 00:08:48.510
detection last week this is something
you can use to detect rude and only only

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:48.520
you can use to detect rude and only only

run on unknown rooted devices if this is
 

00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:53.890
run on unknown rooted devices if this is
something you can do

00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:53.900
something you can do
 

00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:57.880
something you can do
um yeah and you obviously I don't know

00:08:57.880 --> 00:08:57.890
um yeah and you obviously I don't know
 

00:08:57.890 --> 00:08:59.590
um yeah and you obviously I don't know
what's your take on it you can you can

00:08:59.590 --> 00:08:59.600
what's your take on it you can you can
 

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:02.440
what's your take on it you can you can
do a lot of things yeah I think

00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:02.450
do a lot of things yeah I think
 

00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:04.450
do a lot of things yeah I think
generally you've got to think how hard

00:09:04.450 --> 00:09:04.460
generally you've got to think how hard
 

00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:05.650
generally you've got to think how hard
do you need to actually make it for

00:09:05.650 --> 00:09:05.660
do you need to actually make it for
 

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:07.180
do you need to actually make it for
someone to get the API key and I think

00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:07.190
someone to get the API key and I think
 

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.100
someone to get the API key and I think
that's going to be dependent on the use

00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:09.110
that's going to be dependent on the use
 

00:09:09.110 --> 00:09:11.980
that's going to be dependent on the use
case essentially i think the way a lot

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:11.990
case essentially i think the way a lot
 

00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:14.860
case essentially i think the way a lot
of companies will get away around this

00:09:14.860 --> 00:09:14.870
of companies will get away around this
 

00:09:14.870 --> 00:09:16.570
of companies will get away around this
will be to do a combination of

00:09:16.570 --> 00:09:16.580
will be to do a combination of
 

00:09:16.580 --> 00:09:18.730
will be to do a combination of
server-side support as well as clients I

00:09:18.730 --> 00:09:18.740
server-side support as well as clients I
 

00:09:18.740 --> 00:09:20.830
server-side support as well as clients I
which the blog post kind of covers the

00:09:20.830 --> 00:09:20.840
which the blog post kind of covers the
 

00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:23.620
which the blog post kind of covers the
client side of it so yeah I think

00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:23.630
client side of it so yeah I think
 

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.180
client side of it so yeah I think
generally there's going to be certain

00:09:25.180 --> 00:09:25.190
generally there's going to be certain
 

00:09:25.190 --> 00:09:26.440
generally there's going to be certain
methods that are going to work better

00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:26.450
methods that are going to work better
 

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.450
methods that are going to work better
than others but generally it's a case of

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:28.460
than others but generally it's a case of
 

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:31.000
than others but generally it's a case of
how difficult you need to make it for

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:31.010
how difficult you need to make it for
 

00:09:31.010 --> 00:09:32.800
how difficult you need to make it for
someone to then not be interested in

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:32.810
someone to then not be interested in
 

00:09:32.810 --> 00:09:35.230
someone to then not be interested in
getting at the API key so yeah it will

00:09:35.230 --> 00:09:35.240
getting at the API key so yeah it will
 

00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.620
getting at the API key so yeah it will
depend on the scenario yeah we were

00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:41.630
depend on the scenario yeah we were
 

00:09:41.630 --> 00:09:44.680
depend on the scenario yeah we were

more recent API keys now also require a

00:09:57.190 --> 00:09:57.200
more recent API keys now also require a
 

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.140
more recent API keys now also require a
package name to be associated with so

00:09:59.140 --> 00:09:59.150
package name to be associated with so
 

00:09:59.150 --> 00:10:01.240

the Maps API for example your API key
 

00:10:01.250 --> 00:10:02.830
the Maps API for example your API key
can only be used by you because it takes

rarely recommend to use dialogues why is

00:12:05.950 --> 00:12:05.960
rarely recommend to use dialogues why is
 

00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:08.140
rarely recommend to use dialogues why is
that I think it's a useful way not only

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:08.150
that I think it's a useful way not only
 

00:12:08.150 --> 00:12:10.570
that I think it's a useful way not only
to get input data but also show a

00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:10.580
to get input data but also show a
 

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.010
to get input data but also show a
relatively small amount of info that

00:12:12.010 --> 00:12:12.020
relatively small amount of info that
 

00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:13.600
relatively small amount of info that
doesn't really fit anywhere in the app

00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:13.610
doesn't really fit anywhere in the app
 

00:12:13.610 --> 00:12:18.160
doesn't really fit anywhere in the app
so about two to three lines yeah my

00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:18.170
so about two to three lines yeah my
 

00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:20.020
so about two to three lines yeah my
general hatred of dialogues is just due

00:12:20.020 --> 00:12:20.030
general hatred of dialogues is just due
 

00:12:20.030 --> 00:12:23.860
general hatred of dialogues is just due
to their blocking nature it's just you

00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:23.870
to their blocking nature it's just you
 

00:12:23.870 --> 00:12:25.780
to their blocking nature it's just you
really disrupt any flow you might have

00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:25.790
really disrupt any flow you might have
 

00:12:25.790 --> 00:12:28.150
really disrupt any flow you might have
within an application I just think if

00:12:28.150 --> 00:12:28.160
within an application I just think if
 

00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:30.190
within an application I just think if
you can display something in line like

00:12:30.190 --> 00:12:30.200
you can display something in line like
 

00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:31.750
you can display something in line like
two three lines could be given in line

00:12:31.750 --> 00:12:31.760
two three lines could be given in line
 

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:34.570
two three lines could be given in line
some house or somehow some in mind user

00:12:34.570 --> 00:12:34.580

interface element that you don't have to

00:12:35.920 --> 00:12:35.930
interface element that you don't have to
 

00:12:35.930 --> 00:12:37.980
interface element that you don't have to
go to through and like an explicit and

00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:37.990
go to through and like an explicit and
 

00:12:37.990 --> 00:12:40.360
go to through and like an explicit and
dismissal or anything like that and it's

00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:40.370
dismissal or anything like that and it's
 

00:12:40.370 --> 00:12:43.480
dismissal or anything like that and it's
just I thought I find that's better yeah

00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:43.490
just I thought I find that's better yeah
 

00:12:43.490 --> 00:12:46.420
just I thought I find that's better yeah
I kind of really I think one of the the

00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:46.430
I kind of really I think one of the the
 

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.760
I kind of really I think one of the the
most obvious use case for a dialogue is

00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:48.770
most obvious use case for a dialogue is
 

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:50.320
most obvious use case for a dialogue is
when you're in the middle of a sign-in

00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:50.330
when you're in the middle of a sign-in
 

00:12:50.330 --> 00:12:52.030
when you're in the middle of a sign-in
process you've got the user name you've

00:12:52.030 --> 00:12:52.040
process you've got the user name you've
 

00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:54.250
process you've got the user name you've
got the password and then something

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:54.260
got the password and then something
 

00:12:54.260 --> 00:12:55.510
got the password and then something
fails and then it comes with a dialog

00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:55.520
fails and then it comes with a dialog
 

00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:57.580
fails and then it comes with a dialog
saying error something doesn't work it's

00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:57.590
saying error something doesn't work it's
 

00:12:57.590 --> 00:12:59.560
saying error something doesn't work it's
much nicer if you just show a message

00:12:59.560 --> 00:12:59.570
much nicer if you just show a message
 

00:12:59.570 --> 00:13:01.210
much nicer if you just show a message
above the actual form so that way they

00:13:01.210 --> 00:13:01.220
above the actual form so that way they
 

00:13:01.220 --> 00:13:02.680
above the actual form so that way they
can edit what if they want to do or

00:13:02.680 --> 00:13:02.690
can edit what if they want to do or
 

00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:05.380
can edit what if they want to do or
retry there and then there's no by

00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:05.390
retry there and then there's no by
 

00:13:05.390 --> 00:13:06.430
retry there and then there's no by
putting up a dialog you're almost

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.440
putting up a dialog you're almost
 

00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:08.140
putting up a dialog you're almost
already kind of flagging up the fact

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:08.150
already kind of flagging up the fact
 

00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:09.580
already kind of flagging up the fact
that something's gone wrong and blocking

00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:09.590
that something's gone wrong and blocking
 

00:13:09.590 --> 00:13:11.500
that something's gone wrong and blocking
them from trying again yeah so you

00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:11.510
them from trying again yeah so you
 

00:13:11.510 --> 00:13:14.410
them from trying again yeah so you
should only use it in cases where you

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:14.420
should only use it in cases where you
 

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:17.830
should only use it in cases where you
need the users attention and you you

00:13:17.830 --> 00:13:17.840
need the users attention and you you
 

00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:20.100
need the users attention and you you
need the user input

00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:20.110
need the user input
 

00:13:20.110 --> 00:13:22.319
need the user input
but not in the other cases I would

00:13:22.319 --> 00:13:22.329
but not in the other cases I would
 

00:13:22.329 --> 00:13:26.569
but not in the other cases I would
suggest there there are other other

00:13:26.569 --> 00:13:26.579
suggest there there are other other
 

00:13:26.579 --> 00:13:29.190
suggest there there are other other
things in the framework you can use to

00:13:29.190 --> 00:13:29.200
things in the framework you can use to
 

00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:31.980
things in the framework you can use to
notify the user tell them what's going

00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:31.990
notify the user tell them what's going
 

00:13:31.990 --> 00:13:35.250
notify the user tell them what's going
on but I think dialogues dialogues

00:13:35.250 --> 00:13:35.260
on but I think dialogues dialogues
 

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.259
on but I think dialogues dialogues
interrupt user flow as a road on a

00:13:37.259 --> 00:13:37.269
interrupt user flow as a road on a
 

00:13:37.269 --> 00:13:39.300
interrupt user flow as a road on a
moderator and this is why you should be

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:39.310
moderator and this is why you should be
 

00:13:39.310 --> 00:13:43.009
moderator and this is why you should be
really careful when using them and so

00:13:43.009 --> 00:13:43.019
really careful when using them and so
 

00:13:43.019 --> 00:13:47.730
really careful when using them and so
what else do we have okay ask a question

00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:47.740
what else do we have okay ask a question
 

00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.110
what else do we have okay ask a question
please go right of course thanks is it

00:13:52.110 --> 00:13:52.120
please go right of course thanks is it
 

00:13:52.120 --> 00:13:55.949
please go right of course thanks is it
possible to detect if the app is open

00:13:55.949 --> 00:13:55.959
possible to detect if the app is open
 

00:13:55.959 --> 00:14:03.000
possible to detect if the app is open
from a broadcastreceiver um I think you

00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:03.010
from a broadcastreceiver um I think you
 

00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:05.069
from a broadcastreceiver um I think you
can you can I don't know if it's

00:14:05.069 --> 00:14:05.079
can you can I don't know if it's
 

00:14:05.079 --> 00:14:07.710
can you can I don't know if it's
possible from a broadcast receiver but

00:14:07.710 --> 00:14:07.720
possible from a broadcast receiver but
 

00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:11.639
possible from a broadcast receiver but
what you can do is you can grant for the

00:14:11.639 --> 00:14:11.649
what you can do is you can grant for the
 

00:14:11.649 --> 00:14:15.240
what you can do is you can grant for the
get tasks permission and you can from

00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:15.250
get tasks permission and you can from
 

00:14:15.250 --> 00:14:16.980
get tasks permission and you can from
there get the running to us but it says

00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:16.990
there get the running to us but it says
 

00:14:16.990 --> 00:14:18.930
there get the running to us but it says
maybe you have to be very careful

00:14:18.930 --> 00:14:18.940
maybe you have to be very careful
 

00:14:18.940 --> 00:14:20.940
maybe you have to be very careful
because you're requesting the guitars

00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:20.950
because you're requesting the guitars
 

00:14:20.950 --> 00:14:24.449
because you're requesting the guitars
permission but I think this is the the

00:14:24.449 --> 00:14:24.459
permission but I think this is the the
 

00:14:24.459 --> 00:14:26.730
permission but I think this is the the
only way or I think there are one or two

00:14:26.730 --> 00:14:26.740
only way or I think there are one or two
 

00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:30.210
only way or I think there are one or two
ways um I did that on another project

00:14:30.210 --> 00:14:30.220
ways um I did that on another project
 

00:14:30.220 --> 00:14:32.550
ways um I did that on another project
but this is one way you can detect if

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:32.560
but this is one way you can detect if
 

00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:35.310
but this is one way you can detect if
your application is still there and also

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.320
your application is still there and also
 

00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:39.509
your application is still there and also
if it's running but not exactly in in

00:14:39.509 --> 00:14:39.519
if it's running but not exactly in in
 

00:14:39.519 --> 00:14:41.430
if it's running but not exactly in in
rare cases because you're obviously

00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:41.440
rare cases because you're obviously
 

00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:45.990
rare cases because you're obviously
going to request this permission and

00:14:45.990 --> 00:14:46.000
going to request this permission and
 

00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.780
going to request this permission and
people are going wondering player

because not exactly i would like to know
 

00:14:50.560 --> 00:14:53.370
because not exactly i would like to know
if i would like to know if the app but

00:14:53.370 --> 00:14:53.380
if i would like to know if the app but
 

00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:55.740
if i would like to know if the app but

and not just if i can find in the task
 

00:14:58.990 --> 00:15:01.139
and not just if i can find in the task
because you know the app can be in the

because you know the app can be in the

a couple of answers on it but you can

00:15:13.889 --> 00:15:13.899
a couple of answers on it but you can
 

00:15:13.899 --> 00:15:16.259
a couple of answers on it but you can
definitely if I if I remember correctly

00:15:16.259 --> 00:15:16.269
definitely if I if I remember correctly

you can definitely do it from there I

00:15:19.290 --> 00:15:19.300
you can definitely do it from there I
 

00:15:19.300 --> 00:15:24.900
you can definitely do it from there I
will check for that thank you know a

00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:24.910
will check for that thank you know a
 

00:15:24.910 --> 00:15:26.310
will check for that thank you know a
couple of questions on and what would

00:15:26.310 --> 00:15:26.320
couple of questions on and what would
 

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:28.380
couple of questions on and what would
you just know what you also can do I

00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:28.390
you just know what you also can do I
 

00:15:28.390 --> 00:15:32.740
you just know what you also can do I
think one solution is to register

00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:32.750
think one solution is to register
 

00:15:32.750 --> 00:15:36.130
think one solution is to register
dynamic broadcast receiver and from them

00:15:36.130 --> 00:15:36.140
dynamic broadcast receiver and from them
 

00:15:36.140 --> 00:15:39.820
dynamic broadcast receiver and from them
send messages which you can then receive

00:15:39.820 --> 00:15:39.830
send messages which you can then receive
 

00:15:39.830 --> 00:15:41.500
send messages which you can then receive
this is something you also could do

00:15:41.500 --> 00:15:41.510
this is something you also could do
 

00:15:41.510 --> 00:15:44.140
this is something you also could do
because this broadcast receiver will all

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:44.150
because this broadcast receiver will all
 

00:15:44.150 --> 00:15:46.870
because this broadcast receiver will all

will only be active if you're running in
 

00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:50.740
will only be active if you're running in

the menu items on the action bar support
the checked state we tried this but

00:16:02.530 --> 00:16:02.540
the checked state we tried this but
 

00:16:02.540 --> 00:16:06.040
the checked state we tried this but

hall um so the best of my knowledge it

00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.170
hall um so the best of my knowledge it
 

00:16:09.170 --> 00:16:10.540
hall um so the best of my knowledge it
doesn't support necessary the check

00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:10.550
doesn't support necessary the check
 

00:16:10.550 --> 00:16:12.760
doesn't support necessary the check
state but what you can do is just swap

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:12.770
state but what you can do is just swap
 

00:16:12.770 --> 00:16:15.070
state but what you can do is just swap
out the icon depending on the state so

00:16:15.070 --> 00:16:15.080
out the icon depending on the state so
 

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:16.990
out the icon depending on the state so
essentially when you created the menu

00:16:16.990 --> 00:16:17.000
essentially when you created the menu
 

00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.870
essentially when you created the menu
it's safe to keep a reference and the

00:16:19.870 --> 00:16:19.880
it's safe to keep a reference and the
 

00:16:19.880 --> 00:16:21.480
it's safe to keep a reference and the
actual menu itself and then that point

00:16:21.480 --> 00:16:21.490
actual menu itself and then that point
 

00:16:21.490 --> 00:16:24.700
actual menu itself and then that point
use find item by idea i think it is or

00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:24.710
use find item by idea i think it is or
 

00:16:24.710 --> 00:16:25.930
use find item by idea i think it is or
something along those lines to actually

00:16:25.930 --> 00:16:25.940
something along those lines to actually
 

00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:27.340
something along those lines to actually
get reference to that particular item

00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:27.350
get reference to that particular item
 

00:16:27.350 --> 00:16:29.560
get reference to that particular item
and then change the icon depending on

00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:29.570
and then change the icon depending on
 

00:16:29.570 --> 00:16:31.780
and then change the icon depending on
the state so that's the best way that

00:16:31.780 --> 00:16:31.790
the state so that's the best way that
 

00:16:31.790 --> 00:16:35.620
the state so that's the best way that

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:36.980
I'm I put it in a moderator so um give
 

00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:39.850
I'm I put it in a moderator so um give
it a try what he basically does is um he

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:39.860
it a try what he basically does is um he
 

00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.520
it a try what he basically does is um he
wraps his whole layout for the whole

00:18:42.520 --> 00:18:42.530
wraps his whole layout for the whole
 

00:18:42.530 --> 00:18:46.300
wraps his whole layout for the whole
activity uh he makes a custom he makes a

00:18:46.300 --> 00:18:46.310
activity uh he makes a custom he makes a
 

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:48.190
activity uh he makes a custom he makes a
custom layout and what he does he's

00:18:48.190 --> 00:18:48.200
custom layout and what he does he's
 

00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.100
custom layout and what he does he's
intercepting touch events there he's

00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:51.110
intercepting touch events there he's
 

00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.280
intercepting touch events there he's
already on on this page touch event and

00:18:54.280 --> 00:18:54.290
already on on this page touch event and
 

00:18:54.290 --> 00:18:56.860
already on on this page touch event and
then is looking if the touch event

00:18:56.860 --> 00:18:56.870
then is looking if the touch event
 

00:18:56.870 --> 00:19:02.740
then is looking if the touch event
actually was on the info window and when

00:19:02.740 --> 00:19:02.750
actually was on the info window and when
 

00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:04.840
actually was on the info window and when
it was on the info window he's going to

00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:04.850
it was on the info window he's going to
 

00:19:04.850 --> 00:19:08.560
it was on the info window he's going to
manually dispatch the events down to the

00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:08.570
manually dispatch the events down to the
 

00:19:08.570 --> 00:19:11.440
manually dispatch the events down to the
info window and so the info window is

00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:11.450
info window and so the info window is
 

00:19:11.450 --> 00:19:15.100
info window and so the info window is
again kind of a live view this is what

00:19:15.100 --> 00:19:15.110
again kind of a live view this is what
 

00:19:15.110 --> 00:19:18.940
again kind of a live view this is what
he said successfully managed to do but

00:19:18.940 --> 00:19:18.950
he said successfully managed to do but
 

00:19:18.950 --> 00:19:20.980
he said successfully managed to do but
it's still to me it sounds like like

00:19:20.980 --> 00:19:20.990
it's still to me it sounds like like
 

00:19:20.990 --> 00:19:22.600
it's still to me it sounds like like
kind of a keen you should you should

00:19:22.600 --> 00:19:22.610
kind of a keen you should you should
 

00:19:22.610 --> 00:19:25.630
kind of a keen you should you should
have a good reason to do it um yeah

00:19:25.630 --> 00:19:25.640
have a good reason to do it um yeah
 

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.870
have a good reason to do it um yeah
we've discussed this before a long press

00:19:28.870 --> 00:19:28.880
we've discussed this before a long press
 

00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:34.090
we've discussed this before a long press
on on a pop-up in a map view I think

00:19:34.090 --> 00:19:34.100
on on a pop-up in a map view I think
 

00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.920
on on a pop-up in a map view I think
you're my personal opinion is you have

00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:35.930
you're my personal opinion is you have
 

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.490
you're my personal opinion is you have
to have a very good reason to do it um

00:19:38.490 --> 00:19:38.500
to have a very good reason to do it um
 

00:19:38.500 --> 00:19:40.990
to have a very good reason to do it um
yeah but if you have to do it look at

00:19:40.990 --> 00:19:41.000
yeah but if you have to do it look at
 

00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.530
yeah but if you have to do it look at
the moderator and try to intercept the

00:19:44.530 --> 00:19:44.540
the moderator and try to intercept the
 

00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:46.240
the moderator and try to intercept the
touch events and route them yourself

00:19:46.240 --> 00:19:46.250
touch events and route them yourself
 

00:19:46.250 --> 00:19:49.450
touch events and route them yourself
justice what you can do yeah i think it

00:19:49.450 --> 00:19:49.460
justice what you can do yeah i think it
 

00:19:49.460 --> 00:19:51.160
justice what you can do yeah i think it
is morally things i think is probably

00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:51.170
is morally things i think is probably
 

00:19:51.170 --> 00:19:53.350
is morally things i think is probably
missed out for the api because we kind

00:19:53.350 --> 00:19:53.360
missed out for the api because we kind
 

00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:54.820
missed out for the api because we kind
of intend people just to click on it and

00:19:54.820 --> 00:19:54.830
of intend people just to click on it and
 

00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.620

then go through to another screen which

00:19:56.620 --> 00:19:56.630
then go through to another screen which
 

00:19:56.630 --> 00:19:58.120
then go through to another screen which
I actually have all the information at

00:19:58.120 --> 00:19:58.130
I actually have all the information at
 

00:19:58.130 --> 00:20:00.080
I actually have all the information at
all the features that you can

00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:00.090
all the features that you can
 

00:20:00.090 --> 00:20:02.450
all the features that you can
and do from that point so having an

00:20:02.450 --> 00:20:02.460
and do from that point so having an
 

00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:06.320
and do from that point so having an
onclicklistener I don't know I struggled

00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:06.330
onclicklistener I don't know I struggled
 

00:20:06.330 --> 00:20:08.240
onclicklistener I don't know I struggled
to see a situation where the experience

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:08.250
to see a situation where the experience
 

00:20:08.250 --> 00:20:10.250
to see a situation where the experience
is gonna really benefit from having a

00:20:10.250 --> 00:20:10.260
is gonna really benefit from having a
 

00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:12.470
is gonna really benefit from having a
long thick but yeah I'd be interested to

00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:12.480
long thick but yeah I'd be interested to
 

00:20:12.480 --> 00:20:14.120
long thick but yeah I'd be interested to
know what your we're trying to do with

00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:14.130
know what your we're trying to do with
 

00:20:14.130 --> 00:20:20.440
know what your we're trying to do with
it really okay what else do we have

00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:20.450
it really okay what else do we have
 

00:20:20.450 --> 00:20:28.190
it really okay what else do we have
should a good quality of images kind of

00:20:28.190 --> 00:20:28.200

what you can do is um I don't know where

00:20:41.389 --> 00:20:41.399
what you can do is um I don't know where
 

00:20:41.399 --> 00:20:43.760
what you can do is um I don't know where
you get your images from but what you

00:20:43.760 --> 00:20:43.770
you get your images from but what you
 

00:20:43.770 --> 00:20:45.740
you get your images from but what you
can do is I mean you're obviously will

00:20:45.740 --> 00:20:45.750
can do is I mean you're obviously will
 

00:20:45.750 --> 00:20:47.570
can do is I mean you're obviously will
know the width and the height of the

00:20:47.570 --> 00:20:47.580
know the width and the height of the
 

00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:52.220
know the width and the height of the
image in your gallery and to to make

00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:52.230
image in your gallery and to to make
 

00:20:52.230 --> 00:20:55.519
image in your gallery and to to make
sure you have the images are always at a

00:20:55.519 --> 00:20:55.529
sure you have the images are always at a
 

00:20:55.529 --> 00:20:58.669
sure you have the images are always at a
good quality just fetch a slightly

00:20:58.669 --> 00:20:58.679
good quality just fetch a slightly
 

00:20:58.679 --> 00:21:02.630
good quality just fetch a slightly
bigger image from the server and what

00:21:02.630 --> 00:21:02.640
bigger image from the server and what
 

00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.180
bigger image from the server and what
you also can do is then scale it down so

00:21:05.180 --> 00:21:05.190
you also can do is then scale it down so
 

00:21:05.190 --> 00:21:06.980
you also can do is then scale it down so
i sold it will fit so there are a couple

00:21:06.980 --> 00:21:06.990
i sold it will fit so there are a couple
 

00:21:06.990 --> 00:21:10.990
i sold it will fit so there are a couple
of strategies I think optimizing images

00:21:10.990 --> 00:21:11.000
of strategies I think optimizing images
 

00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.200
of strategies I think optimizing images
for the gallery is often done on the

00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:15.210
for the gallery is often done on the
 

00:21:15.210 --> 00:21:18.380
for the gallery is often done on the
server side so you you request different

00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:18.390
server side so you you request different
 

00:21:18.390 --> 00:21:21.950
server side so you you request different
representations from the server for for

00:21:21.950 --> 00:21:21.960
representations from the server for for
 

00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.970
representations from the server for for
different devices yeah but what you

00:21:25.970 --> 00:21:25.980
different devices yeah but what you
 

00:21:25.980 --> 00:21:28.730
different devices yeah but what you
never should do is download like very

00:21:28.730 --> 00:21:28.740
never should do is download like very
 

00:21:28.740 --> 00:21:32.299
never should do is download like very
big images and sample them down and and

00:21:32.299 --> 00:21:32.309
big images and sample them down and and
 

00:21:32.309 --> 00:21:34.010
big images and sample them down and and
and using them with not simply again

00:21:34.010 --> 00:21:34.020
and using them with not simply again
 

00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:35.630
and using them with not simply again
down because this will obviously take a

00:21:35.630 --> 00:21:35.640
down because this will obviously take a
 

00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:38.330
down because this will obviously take a
lot of memory you can you can download a

00:21:38.330 --> 00:21:38.340
lot of memory you can you can download a
 

00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.060
lot of memory you can you can download a
big image if you don't have an image

00:21:41.060 --> 00:21:41.070
big image if you don't have an image
 

00:21:41.070 --> 00:21:44.630
big image if you don't have an image
scaling facility and scale it down and

00:21:44.630 --> 00:21:44.640
scaling facility and scale it down and
 

00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:46.940
scaling facility and scale it down and
then put it interview but what you

00:21:46.940 --> 00:21:46.950
then put it interview but what you
 

00:21:46.950 --> 00:21:50.659
then put it interview but what you
should never do is take in a big image

00:21:50.659 --> 00:21:50.669
should never do is take in a big image
 

00:21:50.669 --> 00:21:53.769
should never do is take in a big image
and putting it in in a gallery and also

00:21:53.769 --> 00:21:53.779
and putting it in in a gallery and also
 

00:21:53.779 --> 00:21:57.980
and putting it in in a gallery and also
recycle your views so yes it is just a

00:21:57.980 --> 00:21:57.990
recycle your views so yes it is just a
 

00:21:57.990 --> 00:21:59.960
recycle your views so yes it is just a
reference that that was referring to a

00:21:59.960 --> 00:21:59.970
reference that that was referring to a
 

00:21:59.970 --> 00:22:01.610
reference that that was referring to a
question that we had on the motor on the

00:22:01.610 --> 00:22:01.620
question that we had on the motor on the
 

00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.470
question that we had on the motor on the
Google+ tree that was actually how do

00:22:03.470 --> 00:22:03.480
Google+ tree that was actually how do
 

00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:06.769
Google+ tree that was actually how do
you maintain good quality for images

00:22:06.769 --> 00:22:06.779
you maintain good quality for images
 

00:22:06.779 --> 00:22:07.909
you maintain good quality for images
when writing custom gallery

00:22:07.909 --> 00:22:07.919
when writing custom gallery
 

00:22:07.919 --> 00:22:11.029
when writing custom gallery
implementation I think just to further

00:22:11.029 --> 00:22:11.039
implementation I think just to further
 

00:22:11.039 --> 00:22:13.399
implementation I think just to further
or staff I say like the main approach

00:22:13.399 --> 00:22:13.409
or staff I say like the main approach
 

00:22:13.409 --> 00:22:13.970
or staff I say like the main approach
that I've seen

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980
that I've seen
 

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.830
that I've seen
people take you this essentially they

00:22:15.830 --> 00:22:15.840
people take you this essentially they
 

00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:17.180
people take you this essentially they
only have access to really big images

00:22:17.180 --> 00:22:17.190
only have access to really big images
 

00:22:17.190 --> 00:22:18.530
only have access to really big images
and therefore when you're doing custom

00:22:18.530 --> 00:22:18.540
and therefore when you're doing custom
 

00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.539
and therefore when you're doing custom
gallery the best solution that I've seen

00:22:20.539 --> 00:22:20.549
gallery the best solution that I've seen
 

00:22:20.549 --> 00:22:22.340
gallery the best solution that I've seen
is just to scale it down store a

00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:22.350
is just to scale it down store a
 

00:22:22.350 --> 00:22:23.780
is just to scale it down store a
reference to the full image as well as a

00:22:23.780 --> 00:22:23.790
reference to the full image as well as a
 

00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.460
reference to the full image as well as a
smaller one and then just use a

00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:25.470
smaller one and then just use a
 

00:22:25.470 --> 00:22:27.080
smaller one and then just use a
thumbnail within the list you and then

00:22:27.080 --> 00:22:27.090
thumbnail within the list you and then
 

00:22:27.090 --> 00:22:28.580
thumbnail within the list you and then
that way you still got access the large

00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:28.590
that way you still got access the large
 

00:22:28.590 --> 00:22:30.470
that way you still got access the large
one if you if you need it for whatever

00:22:30.470 --> 00:22:30.480
one if you if you need it for whatever
 

00:22:30.480 --> 00:22:33.020
one if you if you need it for whatever
reason but you do have to be careful a

00:22:33.020 --> 00:22:33.030
reason but you do have to be careful a
 

00:22:33.030 --> 00:22:34.280
reason but you do have to be careful a
memory manager because you're dealing

00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:34.290
memory manager because you're dealing
 

00:22:34.290 --> 00:22:38.180
memory manager because you're dealing

pointed out to Joe zipper this is what I
 

00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:43.640
pointed out to Joe zipper this is what I
was talking about and with getting the

00:22:43.640 --> 00:22:43.650
was talking about and with getting the
 

00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.919
was talking about and with getting the
running task permission you can refer to

00:22:45.919 --> 00:22:45.929
running task permission you can refer to
 

00:22:45.929 --> 00:22:48.950
running task permission you can refer to
running air process info and you can get

00:22:48.950 --> 00:22:48.960
running air process info and you can get
 

00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.530
running air process info and you can get
the importance from there this is where

00:22:51.530 --> 00:22:51.540
the importance from there this is where

the importance from there this is where
you can tell if you're in the foreground

00:22:53.240 --> 00:22:53.250
you can tell if you're in the foreground
 

00:22:53.250 --> 00:22:56.000
you can tell if you're in the foreground
or not but still be very careful when

00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:56.010
or not but still be very careful when
 

00:22:56.010 --> 00:23:01.640
or not but still be very careful when
using it thank you so this is a question

00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:01.650

commented you can find out what's going
on

00:24:00.540 --> 00:24:00.550
on
 

00:24:00.550 --> 00:24:07.290
on
but on this I can't see much at all yeah

00:24:07.290 --> 00:24:07.300
but on this I can't see much at all yeah
 

00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:11.070
but on this I can't see much at all yeah
so I bench this crown I'd be interested

00:24:11.070 --> 00:24:11.080
so I bench this crown I'd be interested
 

00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:14.040
so I bench this crown I'd be interested
to know what you're doing field to kind

00:24:14.040 --> 00:24:14.050
to know what you're doing field to kind
 

00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:17.100
to know what you're doing field to kind
of caused it I think somewhere along the

00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:17.110
of caused it I think somewhere along the
 

00:24:17.110 --> 00:24:19.380
of caused it I think somewhere along the
lines there was an example of using a

00:24:19.380 --> 00:24:19.390
lines there was an example of using a
 

00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:21.090

only thing to be careful of is that your

00:25:26.330 --> 00:25:26.340
only thing to be careful of is that your
 

00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:32.070
only thing to be careful of is that your
phone or tablet doesn't have hdcp keys

00:25:32.070 --> 00:25:32.080
phone or tablet doesn't have hdcp keys
 

00:25:32.080 --> 00:25:34.680

these things will work fine but then as

00:25:41.550 --> 00:25:41.560
these things will work fine but then as
 

00:25:41.560 --> 00:25:42.480
these things will work fine but then as
soon as you go up to things like the

00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:42.490
soon as you go up to things like the
 

00:25:42.490 --> 00:25:44.490
soon as you go up to things like the
Nexus 4 in the nexus 10 and some of the

00:25:44.490 --> 00:25:44.500
Nexus 4 in the nexus 10 and some of the
 

00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:47.910

content from C so just be careful with

00:25:54.990 --> 00:25:55.000
content from C so just be careful with
 

00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000
content from C so just be careful with
that but yeah I reason imagine it works

00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:57.010
that but yeah I reason imagine it works
 

00:25:57.010 --> 00:26:01.389
that but yeah I reason imagine it works
at City perfectly for me

00:26:01.389 --> 00:26:01.399
 
 

00:26:01.399 --> 00:26:04.070
 
05 alternative if you can is there to

00:26:04.070 --> 00:26:04.080
05 alternative if you can is there to
 

00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:06.549
05 alternative if you can is there to
use an emulator or like a desktop

00:26:06.549 --> 00:26:06.559
use an emulator or like a desktop
 

00:26:06.559 --> 00:26:08.599
use an emulator or like a desktop
software like bluestacks also another

00:26:08.599 --> 00:26:08.609
software like bluestacks also another

Android and use some desktop reporting

00:26:10.159 --> 00:26:10.169
Android and use some desktop reporting
 

00:26:10.169 --> 00:26:12.019
Android and use some desktop reporting
software as well you get quite good

00:26:12.019 --> 00:26:12.029
software as well you get quite good
 

00:26:12.029 --> 00:26:15.590
software as well you get quite good
trail mix there ok we have an

00:26:15.590 --> 00:26:15.600
trail mix there ok we have an
 

00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:19.249
trail mix there ok we have an
interesting question I think from Stefan

00:26:19.249 --> 00:26:19.259
interesting question I think from Stefan
 

00:26:19.259 --> 00:26:21.680
interesting question I think from Stefan
from Berlin he's asking what's the best

00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:21.690
from Berlin he's asking what's the best
 

00:26:21.690 --> 00:26:24.289
from Berlin he's asking what's the best
approach to me great a phone app no

00:26:24.289 --> 00:26:24.299
approach to me great a phone app no
 

00:26:24.299 --> 00:26:27.799
approach to me great a phone app no
fragments to a tablet app ok this is an

00:26:27.799 --> 00:26:27.809
fragments to a tablet app ok this is an
 

00:26:27.809 --> 00:26:32.149
fragments to a tablet app ok this is an
interesting question um what's the best

00:26:32.149 --> 00:26:32.159
interesting question um what's the best
 

00:26:32.159 --> 00:26:34.399
interesting question um what's the best
approach um I think I'm the best

00:26:34.399 --> 00:26:34.409
approach um I think I'm the best
 

00:26:34.409 --> 00:26:38.479
approach um I think I'm the best
approaches to go over over the the

00:26:38.479 --> 00:26:38.489
approaches to go over over the the
 

00:26:38.489 --> 00:26:41.899
approaches to go over over the the
sequential screens on the phone and ask

00:26:41.899 --> 00:26:41.909
sequential screens on the phone and ask
 

00:26:41.909 --> 00:26:45.590
sequential screens on the phone and ask
yourself how will you lay out these

00:26:45.590 --> 00:26:45.600
yourself how will you lay out these
 

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.889
yourself how will you lay out these
screens on a tablet and after you've

00:26:48.889 --> 00:26:48.899
screens on a tablet and after you've
 

00:26:48.899 --> 00:26:51.369
screens on a tablet and after you've
done that you should probably continue

00:26:51.369 --> 00:26:51.379
done that you should probably continue
 

00:26:51.379 --> 00:26:56.930
done that you should probably continue
on taking each activity and refactoring

00:26:56.930 --> 00:26:56.940
on taking each activity and refactoring
 

00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.119
on taking each activity and refactoring
out every code that has to go from the

00:26:59.119 --> 00:26:59.129
out every code that has to go from the
 

00:26:59.129 --> 00:27:03.619
out every code that has to go from the
activity to the fragment and put put all

00:27:03.619 --> 00:27:03.629
activity to the fragment and put put all
 

00:27:03.629 --> 00:27:07.989
activity to the fragment and put put all
screens in fragments and then after that

00:27:07.989 --> 00:27:07.999
screens in fragments and then after that
 

00:27:07.999 --> 00:27:11.720
screens in fragments and then after that
you're going to start rearranging it on

00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:11.730
you're going to start rearranging it on
 

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.239
you're going to start rearranging it on
a tablet but that's what what I would do

00:27:14.239 --> 00:27:14.249
a tablet but that's what what I would do
 

00:27:14.249 --> 00:27:19.129
a tablet but that's what what I would do
is I would think about which which

00:27:19.129 --> 00:27:19.139
is I would think about which which
 

00:27:19.139 --> 00:27:22.849
is I would think about which which
activities or which views visible views

00:27:22.849 --> 00:27:22.859
activities or which views visible views
 

00:27:22.859 --> 00:27:27.859
activities or which views visible views
to the to the to the user go we're on a

00:27:27.859 --> 00:27:27.869
to the to the to the user go we're on a
 

00:27:27.869 --> 00:27:30.950
to the to the to the user go we're on a
tablet and then I would refactor out the

00:27:30.950 --> 00:27:30.960
tablet and then I would refactor out the
 

00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.659
tablet and then I would refactor out the
fragment and then I would do all the

00:27:32.659 --> 00:27:32.669
fragment and then I would do all the
 

00:27:32.669 --> 00:27:36.109
fragment and then I would do all the
rearranging for for the phone and to

00:27:36.109 --> 00:27:36.119
rearranging for for the phone and to
 

00:27:36.119 --> 00:27:37.759
rearranging for for the phone and to
tell that so you can do it step by step

00:27:37.759 --> 00:27:37.769
tell that so you can do it step by step
 

00:27:37.769 --> 00:27:41.389
tell that so you can do it step by step
um what can be very helpful when doing

00:27:41.389 --> 00:27:41.399
um what can be very helpful when doing
 

00:27:41.399 --> 00:27:45.739
um what can be very helpful when doing
it is to using something like an event

00:27:45.739 --> 00:27:45.749
it is to using something like an event
 

00:27:45.749 --> 00:27:49.399
it is to using something like an event
bus because it allows you to 2d couple

00:27:49.399 --> 00:27:49.409
bus because it allows you to 2d couple
 

00:27:49.409 --> 00:27:51.379
bus because it allows you to 2d couple
things of that so you can still use the

00:27:51.379 --> 00:27:51.389
things of that so you can still use the
 

00:27:51.389 --> 00:27:54.440
things of that so you can still use the
old code while also running running a

00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:54.450
old code while also running running a
 

00:27:54.450 --> 00:27:57.549
old code while also running running a
fragment because everything that against

00:27:57.549 --> 00:27:57.559
fragment because everything that against
 

00:27:57.559 --> 00:28:01.399
fragment because everything that against
tend to make code more loosely couple so

00:28:01.399 --> 00:28:01.409
tend to make code more loosely couple so
 

00:28:01.409 --> 00:28:03.859
tend to make code more loosely couple so
this is an approach am I have taken on

00:28:03.859 --> 00:28:03.869
this is an approach am I have taken on
 

00:28:03.869 --> 00:28:07.039
this is an approach am I have taken on
which work very well because you can

00:28:07.039 --> 00:28:07.049
which work very well because you can
 

00:28:07.049 --> 00:28:10.220
which work very well because you can
still keep the app running and and

00:28:10.220 --> 00:28:10.230
still keep the app running and and
 

00:28:10.230 --> 00:28:12.310
still keep the app running and and
having some fragments there

00:28:12.310 --> 00:28:12.320
having some fragments there
 

00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:17.990
having some fragments there
mmm yeah but generally take on the phone

00:28:17.990 --> 00:28:18.000
mmm yeah but generally take on the phone
 

00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:19.970
mmm yeah but generally take on the phone
code extract some fragments and then

00:28:19.970 --> 00:28:19.980
code extract some fragments and then
 

00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:24.080
code extract some fragments and then
rearrange it for the tablet version yeah

00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:24.090
rearrange it for the tablet version yeah
 

00:28:24.090 --> 00:28:25.370
rearrange it for the tablet version yeah
I think that sounds about right like I

00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:25.380
I think that sounds about right like I
 

00:28:25.380 --> 00:28:27.950
I think that sounds about right like I
think you you just need to genuinely

00:28:27.950 --> 00:28:27.960
think you you just need to genuinely
 

00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:31.370
think you you just need to genuinely
think about how you want to sort of

00:28:31.370 --> 00:28:31.380
think about how you want to sort of
 

00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:33.560
think about how you want to sort of
chunk up the logic of the application

00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:33.570
chunk up the logic of the application
 

00:28:33.570 --> 00:28:34.850
chunk up the logic of the application
into fragments because obviously gotta

00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:34.860
into fragments because obviously gotta
 

00:28:34.860 --> 00:28:36.260
into fragments because obviously gotta
want to be through around and once

00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:36.270
want to be through around and once

you've given that out start moving those

00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:38.160
you've given that out start moving those
 

00:28:38.160 --> 00:28:40.430
you've given that out start moving those
those bits of logic you already have

00:28:40.430 --> 00:28:40.440
those bits of logic you already have
 

00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:43.130
those bits of logic you already have
into the fragments and I Stefan said and

00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:43.140
into the fragments and I Stefan said and
 

00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:45.770
into the fragments and I Stefan said and
you get to go okay there's a short

00:28:45.770 --> 00:28:45.780
you get to go okay there's a short
 

00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:48.200
you get to go okay there's a short
question I mean you be white on pages

00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:48.210
question I mean you be white on pages
 

00:28:48.210 --> 00:28:50.990
question I mean you be white on pages
like Android developer android com have

00:28:50.990 --> 00:28:51.000
like Android developer android com have
 

00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.830
like Android developer android com have
no links to example Sam and what what

00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:54.840
no links to example Sam and what what
 

00:28:54.840 --> 00:28:59.690
no links to example Sam and what what
you can do is you can I think what can

00:28:59.690 --> 00:28:59.700
you can do is you can I think what can
 

00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:01.730
you can do is you can I think what can
you get the sample apps you can you can

00:29:01.730 --> 00:29:01.740
you get the sample apps you can you can
 

00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:04.130
you get the sample apps you can you can
get it from if you just a shuttle tool

00:29:04.130 --> 00:29:04.140
get it from if you just a shuttle tool
 

00:29:04.140 --> 00:29:07.190
get it from if you just a shuttle tool
no actually the important thing you

00:29:07.190 --> 00:29:07.200
no actually the important thing you
 

00:29:07.200 --> 00:29:08.600
no actually the important thing you
mixed out when you bet that link is then

00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:08.610
mixed out when you bet that link is then
 

00:29:08.610 --> 00:29:09.920
mixed out when you bet that link is then
you're talking about the design side

00:29:09.920 --> 00:29:09.930
you're talking about the design side
 

00:29:09.930 --> 00:29:12.620
you're talking about the design side
that bit under construction okay sorry

00:29:12.620 --> 00:29:12.630
that bit under construction okay sorry
 

00:29:12.630 --> 00:29:14.840
that bit under construction okay sorry
they're specifically on linked code

00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:14.850
they're specifically on linked code
 

00:29:14.850 --> 00:29:17.930
they're specifically on linked code
stuff so that specifically resources

00:29:17.930 --> 00:29:17.940
stuff so that specifically resources
 

00:29:17.940 --> 00:29:20.540
stuff so that specifically resources
targeted most designers and they're not

00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:20.550
targeted most designers and they're not
 

00:29:20.550 --> 00:29:22.250
targeted most designers and they're not
specially back set by implementation

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:22.260
specially back set by implementation
 

00:29:22.260 --> 00:29:27.260
specially back set by implementation
steps okay you're right so I think

00:29:27.260 --> 00:29:27.270
steps okay you're right so I think
 

00:29:27.270 --> 00:29:29.750
steps okay you're right so I think
generally with this kind of stuff when

00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:29.760
generally with this kind of stuff when
 

00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:31.700
generally with this kind of stuff when
you start looking so if you're finding

00:29:31.700 --> 00:29:31.710
you start looking so if you're finding
 

00:29:31.710 --> 00:29:32.870
you start looking so if you're finding
something in the action bar that

00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:32.880
something in the action bar that
 

00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:35.030
something in the action bar that
mentioned the design guidelines when you

00:29:35.030 --> 00:29:35.040
mentioned the design guidelines when you
 

00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:36.260
mentioned the design guidelines when you
actually then stop looking at the

00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:36.270
actually then stop looking at the
 

00:29:36.270 --> 00:29:38.420
actually then stop looking at the
documentation for the action bar you'll

00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:38.430
documentation for the action bar you'll
 

00:29:38.430 --> 00:29:39.740
documentation for the action bar you'll
actually start finding guides that I'll

00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:39.750
actually start finding guides that I'll
 

00:29:39.750 --> 00:29:42.020
actually start finding guides that I'll
explain how to do each particular part

00:29:42.020 --> 00:29:42.030
explain how to do each particular part
 

00:29:42.030 --> 00:29:43.610
explain how to do each particular part
that will be kind of reference the

00:29:43.610 --> 00:29:43.620
that will be kind of reference the
 

00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:45.920
that will be kind of reference the
design guidelines so yeah I think they

00:29:45.920 --> 00:29:45.930
design guidelines so yeah I think they
 

00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.200
design guidelines so yeah I think they
are the couple for a good reason but

00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:48.210
are the couple for a good reason but
 

00:29:48.210 --> 00:29:49.850
are the couple for a good reason but
generally the documentation is still

00:29:49.850 --> 00:29:49.860
generally the documentation is still
 

00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:52.460
generally the documentation is still
there to back it up and help you in

00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:52.470
there to back it up and help you in
 

00:29:52.470 --> 00:29:54.770
there to back it up and help you in
whatever way you need to so i think it's

00:29:54.770 --> 00:29:54.780
whatever way you need to so i think it's
 

00:29:54.780 --> 00:29:56.600
whatever way you need to so i think it's
it's quite a good way of doing it like

00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:56.610
it's quite a good way of doing it like
 

00:29:56.610 --> 00:29:58.970
it's quite a good way of doing it like
Nick surges it's mo things anything they

00:29:58.970 --> 00:29:58.980
Nick surges it's mo things anything they
 

00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:00.650
Nick surges it's mo things anything they
get design us to start thinking in an

00:30:00.650 --> 00:30:00.660
get design us to start thinking in an
 

00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:02.960
get design us to start thinking in an
Android way when they're not really used

00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:02.970
Android way when they're not really used
 

00:30:02.970 --> 00:30:05.390

to it it's good and scaring them off

00:30:05.390 --> 00:30:05.400
to it it's good and scaring them off
 

00:30:05.400 --> 00:30:06.980
to it it's good and scaring them off
with code and certain things like that

00:30:06.980 --> 00:30:06.990
with code and certain things like that
 

00:30:06.990 --> 00:30:09.560
with code and certain things like that
like if they're not into that then it's

00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:09.570
like if they're not into that then it's
 

00:30:09.570 --> 00:30:11.720
like if they're not into that then it's
fairly yeah I think it's getting bad

00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:11.730
fairly yeah I think it's getting bad
 

00:30:11.730 --> 00:30:14.210
fairly yeah I think it's getting bad
right like a I want all developers to

00:30:14.210 --> 00:30:14.220
right like a I want all developers to
 

00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:15.980
right like a I want all developers to
read the design guide right and I can

00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:15.990
read the design guide right and I can
 

00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:17.900
read the design guide right and I can
see the benefit for having links fruit

00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:17.910

dealing with the densities is might be a

00:31:19.549 --> 00:31:19.559
dealing with the densities is might be a
 

00:31:19.559 --> 00:31:21.590
dealing with the densities is might be a
bit of an issue but i'm sure and you can

00:31:21.590 --> 00:31:21.600
bit of an issue but i'm sure and you can
 

00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:24.259
bit of an issue but i'm sure and you can
deal with it no something it sounds
