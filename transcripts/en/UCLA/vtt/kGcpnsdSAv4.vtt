00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:08.330
- Thank you, everybody, so much
for coming in this evening.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.910
And joining us for session
five of 10 questions.

00:00:13.910 --> 00:00:15.973
Tonight's question is,

00:00:17.110 --> 00:00:18.733
everybody remembers,

00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:21.893
what is memory?

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.120
And whatever else it is

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.850
and whatever the things we
learn from the conversation

00:00:28.850 --> 00:00:31.750
that we'll all have together this evening,

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:36.750
one thing memory is this
remarkable human capacity,

00:00:37.010 --> 00:00:40.730
this idea of our comprehension

00:00:40.730 --> 00:00:43.740
of what isn't with us, who
isn't with us in a room.

00:00:43.740 --> 00:00:45.223
And I say that tonight,

00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.210
because it's with absence
in fact that we begin

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:52.063
this evening's session.

00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:57.070
We originalLy have four speakers
scheduled for this evening

00:00:57.070 --> 00:00:59.750
as we do every Tuesday evening.

00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.590
And like each session,

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:04.260
those four guest will have a conversation

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.670
around tonight's questions.

00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:10.460
Sadly, world arts and cultures professor,

00:01:10.460 --> 00:01:15.460
Polly Nooter Roberts, listed
for tonight's session,

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:18.113
passed away in September.

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:23.680
A brilliant scholar, a beloved teacher,

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.610
a colleague, a wife, a mother,

00:01:26.610 --> 00:01:28.700
Polly brightened so many of our lives

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:32.693
with her brilliant mind, luminous spirit,

00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:36.910
unyielding optimism and
boundless generosity

00:01:38.410 --> 00:01:41.770
that we will all remember
her tonight of all nights

00:01:41.770 --> 00:01:42.840
here within the school.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:46.310
Polly shared these thoughts
about the role of memory

00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.530
in her own wonderful research

00:01:48.530 --> 00:01:53.180
undertaken as a faculty member
in world arts cultures dance

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:54.810
here in the school of
arts and architecture.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:57.713
Polly wrote this way regarding memory.

00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:00.410
One of the deep subjects of my work

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:05.410
is memory and how memories are
transformed into histories.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:10.360
But really what memory
is and its transformation

00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:15.233
into a historical account
comes down to this.

00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:19.010
The telling of a story.

00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:20.560
It's the narration of the story

00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:22.440
from a particular person's point of view

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:24.310
at a specific moment in time

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.253
in front of a certain audience,

00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.670
that is what becomes history.

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:32.710
And another person reciting another story

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:35.360
in another place is telling history too,

00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.360
but it may be a completely
different history

00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:39.720
because it is a different person

00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:41.923
with a different perspective on the past.

00:02:43.130 --> 00:02:46.873
In the end, memory is
always a performance.

00:02:48.300 --> 00:02:50.950
This evening we continue
to remember Polly.

00:02:50.950 --> 00:02:54.660
We hold her absence close to us throughout

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:58.710
this conversation and every
day here within the school.

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.860
We write her into our story this evening,

00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:04.913
and dedicate this evening's
discussion to her memory.

00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:12.590
And with that, let me
introduce this evening's guest.

00:03:12.590 --> 00:03:14.540
Let me invite them up to the stage now.

00:03:17.746 --> 00:03:20.163
(applauding)

00:03:29.954 --> 00:03:33.121
Dr. Darnell Hunt is director of UCLA's

00:03:34.020 --> 00:03:37.410
Ralph J. Bunche Center for
African-American Studies.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:39.860
He's the author of the
Hollywood Diversity Report

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:43.370
and professor of sociology.

00:03:43.370 --> 00:03:45.750
His research interest include race, media,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.310
and cultural studies.

00:03:48.310 --> 00:03:53.225
Dr. Kelsey martin is a neuroscientist

00:03:53.225 --> 00:03:55.430
(audience applauding)

00:03:55.430 --> 00:03:58.670
and dean of the David Geffen
School of Medicine at UCLA.

00:03:58.670 --> 00:04:02.110
Dr. Martin is a professor
of biological chemistry

00:04:02.110 --> 00:04:06.100
and of psychiatry and
bio behavioral sciences,

00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:07.970
and has been a leader in UCLA's drive

00:04:07.970 --> 00:04:10.510
to promote cross disciplinary cooperation

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:13.030
among scientists in neuroscience

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:16.450
and other brain-related research.

00:04:16.450 --> 00:04:19.700
And finally, distinguished
professor, Peter Sellars,

00:04:19.700 --> 00:04:24.700
from our own department of
world arts cultures dance,

00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:28.900
is an opera theater and festival director

00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.540
who has gained renowned worldwide

00:04:30.540 --> 00:04:34.280
for his groundbreaking and
transformative interpretations

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:38.280
of artistic masterpieces
and collaborative projects

00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.640
with an extraordinary
range of creative artists.

00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.210
He's known for exploring
challenging moral issues,

00:04:44.210 --> 00:04:46.500
such as race, war, poverty,

00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.530
and the international refugee
crisis through his work.

00:04:50.530 --> 00:04:53.150
And as we have done in previous sessions,

00:04:53.150 --> 00:04:54.710
we're going to invite each of our guest

00:04:54.710 --> 00:04:56.100
to make a brief presentation.

00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.510
And from that, enjoy an
evening's conversation

00:04:58.510 --> 00:05:01.913
around tonight's question: What is memory?

00:05:03.450 --> 00:05:05.100
And we have an agreed order,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.600
and we will begin this
evening with Kelsey Martin.

00:05:08.593 --> 00:05:11.010
(applauding)

00:05:14.823 --> 00:05:17.740
(faintly speaking)

00:05:22.230 --> 00:05:25.770
- My whole research program is around

00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.127
how are memory stored in the brain.

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.540
And so, why do we think about the brain?

00:05:30.540 --> 00:05:34.470
It's because we know for
many studies in humans

00:05:34.470 --> 00:05:36.330
that when there are lesions in the brain,

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:39.130
for example in the part of
the brain called hippocampus.

00:05:39.130 --> 00:05:40.230
It's called hippocampus

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.060
because it looks a little like a seahorse.

00:05:43.060 --> 00:05:44.300
When there's a stroke there,

00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:47.580
when there's some kind of an injury,

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:50.810
the person with that
injury can no longer form

00:05:50.810 --> 00:05:52.240
long-term memory.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.570
So their experiences are never actually

00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:56.623
encoded into a long=term memory.

00:05:58.480 --> 00:06:00.640
Similarly, other parts of the brain

00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:02.150
when there are lesions there,

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:06.490
there are alterations in
a way that that individual

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.598
perceive the world will behave,

00:06:09.598 --> 00:06:12.100
will encode information,

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:16.840
and will in turn transform
that information into memories,

00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:20.667
and those memories are
thus stored in the brain.

00:06:20.667 --> 00:06:24.130
And we really wanna understand
how it is, that experience,

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.200
how our everyday experience

00:06:29.040 --> 00:06:31.210
is encoded in that region of the brain.

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:33.230
So, the human brain is shown here.

00:06:33.230 --> 00:06:37.013
It's a three-pound organ in our head.

00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:41.170
And about well over 100 years ago,

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.400
Ramon Y Cajal who was a
Spanish neuroscientist

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.110
literally sitting at his
kitchen table with a microscope,

00:06:48.110 --> 00:06:50.440
using this beautiful staining method

00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:53.530
where you could see individual
nerve cells in the brain.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:55.920
This was from a pigeon brain.

00:06:55.920 --> 00:06:59.300
He saw this and he
realized from looking at it

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:01.470
that there were all these different cells,

00:07:01.470 --> 00:07:03.190
and it wasn't a whole gamish.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.120
At the time, it was
thought to be a syncytium.

00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:08.540
And you looked at it and
he saw here's one cell

00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:13.540
that has this incredible
elaborate arbor of processes.

00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:16.500
And he saw that they contacted each other

00:07:16.500 --> 00:07:18.340
at specific sites.

00:07:18.340 --> 00:07:22.600
And just by looking at that
structure of the brain,

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.640
he came up with the idea that

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.840
those connections between nerve cells

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.633
might be the site where
memories are stored.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.820
So this was not any kind of
molecular biology, no genetics.

00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:40.860
It was really by looking at the form

00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:44.623
that the neuro cells existed in the brain.

00:07:46.070 --> 00:07:47.940
So that's well over 100 years,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.110
and we now know that he was right,

00:07:50.110 --> 00:07:53.590
that there's something that
we call synoptic plasticity.

00:07:53.590 --> 00:07:56.640
Those sites of contact,
they're called synapse,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:59.373
they're the re-clasping together,

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.170
that those sites, those
synoptic connections

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:05.033
change with our experience.

00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:09.060
And in fact, while you're sitting here,

00:08:09.060 --> 00:08:13.320
if you remember anything
at the end of this evening,

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.820
you will have a different
structure in your brain.

00:08:15.820 --> 00:08:19.590
Those nerve cells will be
forming different synapses.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.850
You will have gain some new synapses,

00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:25.520
and we have a lot of really, to me,

00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:29.080
beautiful empowering tools
for standing to understand

00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.290
how that process works.

00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:34.170
That was over a hundred years ago.

00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:39.050
Now we can use tools using
genetics and molecular biology

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.540
where we can label nerve cells

00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:44.720
using a lot of different
fluorescent proteins.

00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.210
This is in the part of the brain

00:08:46.210 --> 00:08:49.430
called the cerebellum in
the back of your head,

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:50.500
in the back of your brain

00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:53.140
that's involved in coordination.

00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:55.600
Motor skills, motor learning.

00:08:55.600 --> 00:08:58.360
These are beautiful
cerebellar Purkinje neurons

00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.550
that form these arbors,

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:02.090
and here you can label individual neurons

00:09:02.090 --> 00:09:03.880
with different fluorescent proteins,

00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:05.680
so you can see what their structure is

00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.453
and how they contact one another.

00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:10.920
Here's a nerve cell that's in your cortex,

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.550
the part of your brain that's required for

00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:15.530
what we call executive function,

00:09:15.530 --> 00:09:17.963
making sure that you
behave professionally.

00:09:19.281 --> 00:09:24.270
And we can label the whole neuron in red,

00:09:24.270 --> 00:09:26.620
but we can label the individual synapses,

00:09:26.620 --> 00:09:30.570
those places where nerve cells
communicate with one another,

00:09:30.570 --> 00:09:32.410
and where there's that plasticity

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:36.470
where memories can be stored
with that green label.

00:09:36.470 --> 00:09:41.310
And so, over time, one can
look at those individual cells,

00:09:41.310 --> 00:09:45.790
you can do something where
you can use genetics to label

00:09:45.790 --> 00:09:49.280
multiple cells in what's
called the neural circuit,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.720
and why is this important.

00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:55.360
It's because the human brain
has about 100 billion neurons,

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.950
and it has about 100 trillion synapses.

00:09:57.950 --> 00:10:00.613
It's this incredibly complex circuit.

00:10:01.620 --> 00:10:05.970
It's the circuitry that
underlies our perception,

00:10:05.970 --> 00:10:09.000
our emotions, our ability to remember,

00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.600
the way we behave, the way we move,

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.030
and all of that changes over time.

00:10:14.030 --> 00:10:16.650
It's hard wired when we're born,

00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.110
but it undergoes this dynamic remodeling.

00:10:20.110 --> 00:10:23.600
And so the way that I think about memory

00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:27.440
is how does that dynamic
remodeling happen.

00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:29.980
We can even take nerve cells, for example,

00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:32.430
at a very high powered microscope,

00:10:32.430 --> 00:10:34.480
looking at it, stimulating it,

00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:38.080
and you can watch over time that these new

00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:41.640
sites of contact, these
new synapses will grow.

00:10:41.640 --> 00:10:43.890
So that kind of plasticity
is something that

00:10:43.890 --> 00:10:46.550
we can now begin to really understand

00:10:46.550 --> 00:10:49.430
what are the underlying
molecular mechanisms.

00:10:49.430 --> 00:10:51.010
And by understanding that,

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:54.910
the hope is really that
we'll be able to address

00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:57.850
disease that involve memory,

00:10:57.850 --> 00:10:59.170
whether those are things like

00:10:59.170 --> 00:11:00.920
post traumatic stress disorder

00:11:00.920 --> 00:11:02.780
or things like Alzheimer's disease

00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:05.060
where there's a loss of memory.

00:11:05.060 --> 00:11:07.700
And the other thing
that studies like this,

00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:11.480
they've revealed over a history of work

00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:14.100
for many different people across the globe

00:11:14.100 --> 00:11:17.580
are three principles that I
think are really important.

00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:19.550
For us as human beings.

00:11:19.550 --> 00:11:21.400
One of them is that
there's something called

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.800
a critical period in childhood,

00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:26.660
and it's really the period
up through adolescence

00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.160
at which that kind of synapses plasticity

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.140
is particularly powerful.

00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:34.310
And so our early childhood experiences

00:11:34.310 --> 00:11:36.940
are stored in changes in the connectivity

00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:39.410
of deep brain structures

00:11:39.410 --> 00:11:42.100
in what's called the limbic system

00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:46.210
that very powerfully alters
the way that we see the world,

00:11:46.210 --> 00:11:50.460
and hence children who
have traumatic experiences

00:11:50.460 --> 00:11:52.770
will carry that with them,

00:11:52.770 --> 00:11:55.930
and then their subsequent experiences

00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:57.423
will be altered by that.

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.970
Another features is that emotion

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:04.790
has a powerful impact on
that synaptic plasticity.

00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.350
So, I'm gonna age myself here,

00:12:08.350 --> 00:12:11.893
but if you remember, and I
was really young at the time.

00:12:13.900 --> 00:12:17.430
I remember when JFK was killed,

00:12:17.430 --> 00:12:19.130
and I remember my mom crying,

00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:21.350
and I remember that situation quite well.

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:23.810
I really remember when Price Di died

00:12:23.810 --> 00:12:24.880
because it was this very,

00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:26.470
there was a lot of emotion.

00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:30.760
And that emotion tends to really enhance

00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:32.900
plasticity and memory formation.

00:12:32.900 --> 00:12:34.860
So there's a lot of work on

00:12:34.860 --> 00:12:39.860
what's the role of emotion,
and attention, and alertness

00:12:40.310 --> 00:12:42.650
in forming memories.

00:12:42.650 --> 00:12:47.450
Another important feature
of memory is repetition,

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.480
and I think any student knows this.

00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:53.520
There's lots of work
that shows that if you

00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.270
wanna learn how to play the piano

00:12:55.270 --> 00:12:58.610
and you practice once
a week for two hours,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:02.763
that's not as good as practicing
every day for half an hour.

00:13:03.675 --> 00:13:08.440
So that kind of repetition
is a way that our brains

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:11.120
are able to promote that plasticity

00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:13.410
and that storage of memory.

00:13:13.410 --> 00:13:17.060
So these, I think of myself as

00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:20.590
somewhat of what I call a reductionist.

00:13:20.590 --> 00:13:22.673
I think of what's the real,

00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.270
the concrete storage,

00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:30.650
what we call the n-gram
of memory in the brain.

00:13:30.650 --> 00:13:35.310
And yet I recognize that this
doesn't necessarily capture

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.380
what our own individual
experiences of memory are,

00:13:38.380 --> 00:13:40.970
and yet it does tell me
something very important

00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:43.610
about my own experience of memory,

00:13:43.610 --> 00:13:45.720
which is that it's dynamic,

00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:49.370
that all of my past experiences

00:13:49.370 --> 00:13:51.630
are changing the way that I'm perceiving

00:13:52.700 --> 00:13:56.480
any ongoing experience,
and that that in turn

00:13:56.480 --> 00:13:59.760
means that memory can be
quite fallible and subjective.

00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:03.150
It's not a recording of reality.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:05.680
It's an act somewhere between recording

00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:11.510
and sort of creativity that
comes with your entire past

00:14:11.510 --> 00:14:13.830
experience as a human being.

00:14:13.830 --> 00:14:17.540
And so I think that that
understanding of the biology

00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:21.050
and understanding how the biology explains

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.050
that dynamic, subjective
emotional component of memory

00:14:26.240 --> 00:14:29.598
holds a lot of promise for
understanding many aspects

00:14:29.598 --> 00:14:34.598
of human experience and
of psychiatric disease.

00:14:36.024 --> 00:14:37.673
(audience applauding)
- Cheers, thank you.

00:14:37.673 --> 00:14:39.173
Kelsey, thank you.

00:14:44.711 --> 00:14:46.477
Everyone, Darnell Hunt.

00:14:46.477 --> 00:14:47.310
- Alright.

00:15:00.580 --> 00:15:02.800
Okay, in many ways, I'm gonna pick up

00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:04.360
where Kelsey left off.

00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:06.620
She was talking about a very concrete way

00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.650
of thinking about memory.

00:15:08.650 --> 00:15:11.090
I'm gonna talk about ways in which

00:15:11.090 --> 00:15:14.720
the social interacts with the biological,

00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.057
ways in which what happens
to us in our lives,

00:15:17.057 --> 00:15:21.823
in our experiences affect
the way the brain remembers.

00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:25.930
In social science, we have a
number of different ways of

00:15:25.930 --> 00:15:27.880
talking about memory conventionally.

00:15:27.880 --> 00:15:30.140
We talk about sensory memory,

00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:32.930
which really allows us to retain

00:15:32.930 --> 00:15:35.740
snippets of information
from second to second.

00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:39.430
For example, seeing a frame of a film

00:15:39.430 --> 00:15:42.270
and seeing that over time that
it looks like fluid motion,

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:45.040
because we can remember
those individual images,

00:15:45.040 --> 00:15:49.040
or short-term memory
which allows us to kind of

00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.560
understand the meaning of a sentence

00:15:51.560 --> 00:15:53.150
because we remember the
first part of the sentence

00:15:53.150 --> 00:15:54.540
to the end of the sentence.

00:15:54.540 --> 00:15:56.970
And then we have something
we call long-term memory

00:15:56.970 --> 00:16:00.230
which really gets to our connections

00:16:00.230 --> 00:16:02.590
with a particular point
in time or a place.

00:16:02.590 --> 00:16:04.240
We tend to remember those things

00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.650
over longer periods of time,

00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.210
particularly when we're exposed to those

00:16:08.210 --> 00:16:09.693
same conditions over again.

00:16:11.170 --> 00:16:13.220
That's a conventional way
of thinking about memory

00:16:13.220 --> 00:16:14.740
within the social sciences,

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:18.840
which picks up a lot of its insight from

00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:21.130
the biological sciences.

00:16:21.130 --> 00:16:24.680
Today though, I'm gonna
talk about the intertextual

00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.050
and meaning making.

00:16:26.050 --> 00:16:28.020
And take a second to read this quote here.

00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:31.730
It actually connects very well with

00:16:31.730 --> 00:16:34.310
something that Brett mentioned
at the very beginning

00:16:34.310 --> 00:16:35.700
about Polly and her work.

00:16:35.700 --> 00:16:36.950
Why don't you take a second to read this,

00:16:36.950 --> 00:16:38.150
and then we'll continue?

00:16:46.750 --> 00:16:49.790
The basic idea here is
that as human beings,

00:16:49.790 --> 00:16:54.690
storytelling is hardwired into who we are.

00:16:54.690 --> 00:16:56.260
We connect with other people,

00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.570
we communicate by telling stories,

00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:01.293
and often those stories
involve our memories.

00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.080
Today I wanna talk about something called

00:17:06.080 --> 00:17:08.800
the circle of culture which,

00:17:08.800 --> 00:17:11.310
in a second, you'll see how
this relates to the idea

00:17:11.310 --> 00:17:13.760
of what I call intertextual memories.

00:17:13.760 --> 00:17:17.610
In here we have a circuit
of five important moments

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:19.130
starting with representation.

00:17:19.130 --> 00:17:23.130
And by representation, I
mean the irresistible images,

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:25.420
ideas, utterances,

00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.440
that shape the way we
think about the world.

00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:31.930
And examples of representations
might be things like

00:17:31.930 --> 00:17:36.930
race, a concept that defines
people to certain categories.

00:17:37.240 --> 00:17:38.900
In sociology, we talk about it

00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:42.540
as a social constructed concept.

00:17:42.540 --> 00:17:44.330
Or gender,

00:17:44.330 --> 00:17:47.930
or any number of other
concepts that are used

00:17:47.930 --> 00:17:51.060
to put people into categories
to help us make sense

00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:53.513
of what would otherwise
would be a chaotic world.

00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:57.600
The insight of this
particular diagram is that

00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.870
representations connected
to all these other things

00:17:59.870 --> 00:18:02.770
like identity, who we are, who we aren't,

00:18:02.770 --> 00:18:04.090
who we hope to be.

00:18:04.090 --> 00:18:06.970
Production, the types of
things we produce in society,

00:18:06.970 --> 00:18:09.210
the way we produce them as a reflection

00:18:09.210 --> 00:18:10.620
of who we think we are,

00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.840
or of the representations
that order our society.

00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.163
The things we consume.

00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.810
Advertising, obviously.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.830
I think Kelsey was sort
of referencing this

00:18:19.830 --> 00:18:21.670
a few minutes ago, in
terms of representation,

00:18:21.670 --> 00:18:24.100
I mean, I'm sorry, repetition
and remembering things.

00:18:24.100 --> 00:18:28.830
One of the core, I guess,
practices within advertising

00:18:28.830 --> 00:18:33.830
is to repeatedly give the same
message over and over again

00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:36.260
to compel people to remember the product

00:18:36.260 --> 00:18:38.850
and to hopefully consume it over time.

00:18:38.850 --> 00:18:41.600
And then regulation,
how we draw boundaries

00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:42.480
between different groups,

00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.510
who's inside, who's outside.

00:18:44.510 --> 00:18:45.900
All of these things are bound up

00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:47.910
with the concept of representation,

00:18:47.910 --> 00:18:50.560
they affect who we are
in terms of our identity,

00:18:50.560 --> 00:18:53.593
what we as a culture
produce, and what we consume.

00:18:55.290 --> 00:18:57.480
Now, I wanna move forward to what I call

00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:59.810
the media experience.

00:18:59.810 --> 00:19:02.570
And here of course representation becomes

00:19:02.570 --> 00:19:05.470
a very important part
of what happens when we

00:19:05.470 --> 00:19:10.470
experience media text,
movies, television, et cetera.

00:19:10.710 --> 00:19:13.460
Representations like race, like gender

00:19:14.480 --> 00:19:17.590
information the intertextual memories

00:19:17.590 --> 00:19:19.790
that we bring to the media experience.

00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.250
When we watch something on television,

00:19:21.250 --> 00:19:23.120
we don't watch it cold.

00:19:23.120 --> 00:19:25.270
We're always watching it in relation

00:19:25.270 --> 00:19:27.650
to other things we've seen in the past.

00:19:27.650 --> 00:19:30.250
These media text both shape

00:19:30.250 --> 00:19:31.820
and are shaped by representation.

00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.620
That is to say people
who create media text

00:19:34.620 --> 00:19:36.850
are trafficking in the representations

00:19:36.850 --> 00:19:39.040
that circulate in society.

00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:42.450
Those media text become part of

00:19:42.450 --> 00:19:45.300
the fluid reservoir of
memories that circulate

00:19:45.300 --> 00:19:47.110
as people engage with them.

00:19:47.110 --> 00:19:50.120
This is kinda happening at
the macro level in society,

00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.570
kinda the level above the individual,

00:19:52.570 --> 00:19:54.300
the level of collectivities.

00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:55.657
If we move more to the micro level

00:19:55.657 --> 00:19:58.380
and what's happening with
individuals like you and me,

00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:00.280
like those of us sitting in this room,

00:20:01.290 --> 00:20:05.580
we are decoding what we're
seeing and hearing on television.

00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:09.510
And often that decoding is a product

00:20:09.510 --> 00:20:13.040
largely of the memories we
bring to that situation.

00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.280
We may have encountered
things like this in the past,

00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:18.850
which cause us to interpret
it in a particular way.

00:20:18.850 --> 00:20:23.030
At the same time, as
individuals, we exist in society.

00:20:23.030 --> 00:20:24.220
We're not isolated.

00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:26.830
That is to say we interact
with other people.

00:20:26.830 --> 00:20:30.780
So there's always decoding
in a social context,

00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:34.330
often in the networks in which
we are embedded in society,

00:20:34.330 --> 00:20:37.270
our friends, our family, et cetera.

00:20:37.270 --> 00:20:39.810
Often our discussions with them,

00:20:39.810 --> 00:20:42.340
their interpretations of what we saw

00:20:42.340 --> 00:20:45.550
inflect the way we interpret it.

00:20:45.550 --> 00:20:48.130
This goes to what we
call negotiated decoding

00:20:48.130 --> 00:20:50.310
where we kind of negotiate the meaning

00:20:50.310 --> 00:20:52.530
of a particular encounter

00:20:52.530 --> 00:20:56.080
on the basis of our own
individual predispositions,

00:20:56.080 --> 00:20:57.670
filtered through the lens

00:20:57.670 --> 00:21:00.100
of our interactions with important others.

00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:02.470
And as you can see,
this flows back into our

00:21:02.470 --> 00:21:05.430
intertextual memories,
the cycle repeats itself.

00:21:05.430 --> 00:21:06.730
There really is on start or end.

00:21:06.730 --> 00:21:08.530
This is an ongoing cycle.

00:21:08.530 --> 00:21:10.340
Alright, this is a theoretical model

00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:12.580
that's influenced by something known as

00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:14.640
British cultural studies,

00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.720
which was an intellectual tradition

00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:19.660
that arose in the 1970s,

00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:22.890
largely as a correction to, at the time,

00:21:22.890 --> 00:21:26.470
overly deterministic ways of

00:21:26.470 --> 00:21:29.930
sort of conceptualizing
the relationship between

00:21:29.930 --> 00:21:32.090
meaning making and messages.

00:21:32.090 --> 00:21:33.750
There was a belief at one point in time

00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:34.840
in the magic bullet theory

00:21:34.840 --> 00:21:36.850
that if you send a message,

00:21:36.850 --> 00:21:41.080
it will, like a magic
bullet, enter into our brains

00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:43.960
and lead to a particular type of meaning.

00:21:43.960 --> 00:21:47.200
And that was the
orthodoxy for a long time.

00:21:47.200 --> 00:21:49.610
Eventually, however, empirical studies

00:21:49.610 --> 00:21:52.300
started to show that it
doesn't quite work that way.

00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.262
People are amazingly creative at

00:21:56.262 --> 00:21:59.710
changing sort of the main
stream or dominant view

00:21:59.710 --> 00:22:01.180
of a particular message.

00:22:01.180 --> 00:22:02.360
And so the question became,

00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:03.510
how do we measure this?

00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.520
How do we understand this empirically?

00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.320
And so this model is
meant to try to do this.

00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.390
The thing I want to emphasize
today of course is that

00:22:10.390 --> 00:22:11.500
intertextual memories,

00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.670
the memories of all the other encounters

00:22:13.670 --> 00:22:14.620
we have in our lives,

00:22:14.620 --> 00:22:18.040
with media, with messages,
with other people

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:20.223
are an integral part of the process.

00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:24.610
So, to kinda work through
this idea really quickly,

00:22:24.610 --> 00:22:29.180
I wanna take the case of the
1992 Los Angeles uprisings,

00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:30.860
something I've written about in the past.

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:32.730
In fact, I think you reviewed

00:22:32.730 --> 00:22:35.793
a chapter from the book I wrote on this.

00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:42.160
So, one way of thinking
about the 1992 uprisings,

00:22:42.730 --> 00:22:45.600
particularly memories
of the 1992 uprisings

00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:48.270
is by looking at the way those events

00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:50.763
were depicted on television.

00:22:51.640 --> 00:22:54.113
For those who weren't around in 1992,

00:22:55.270 --> 00:22:57.480
the 1992 uprisings, at the time,

00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.900
were described by the LA Times as

00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.593
the worst riots of the century.

00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:05.560
There was over a billion dollars

00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.220
worth of damage in Los Angeles.

00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.420
There were 52 people who were killed.

00:23:10.420 --> 00:23:11.920
There were thousands arrested.

00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.800
The event came on the heels
of not guilty verdicts

00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.320
in the Rodney King beating case.

00:23:18.320 --> 00:23:21.440
He was a black motorist who
was pulled over by police.

00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:25.070
And it just so happen that a passerby

00:23:25.070 --> 00:23:27.653
has camcorder and
recorded the whole thing.

00:23:28.530 --> 00:23:31.590
The video was taken to
a local news station

00:23:31.590 --> 00:23:32.763
and it went viral.

00:23:35.528 --> 00:23:37.557
The thing I wanna emphasize here,

00:23:37.557 --> 00:23:40.410
and we can talk more about
this in our discussion,

00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:45.410
is that I screen for 15 groups of viewers

00:23:46.850 --> 00:23:50.870
on the basis of their race and their class

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.150
the exact same 17-minute news clip.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:56.310
And part of what I
wanted to understand was

00:23:56.310 --> 00:23:59.070
how are people making
sense of this news clip

00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:02.253
based on their positioning in society.

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:04.910
One of the things I expected

00:24:04.910 --> 00:24:07.670
and one of the things I found was that

00:24:07.670 --> 00:24:11.890
as they talk about the
event in their groups,

00:24:11.890 --> 00:24:16.700
intertextual memories
of other similar events

00:24:16.700 --> 00:24:20.890
of movies they had seen, television shows,

00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:23.180
speeches they had heard

00:24:23.180 --> 00:24:26.200
shaped the way they were
processing the information.

00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.140
And there was interesting
patterning along racial lines,

00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:31.907
in terms of how those
interpretations played out.

00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.110
So, in closing, and we can continue this

00:24:41.110 --> 00:24:44.540
a little bit, in a few
minutes, the actual.

00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.290
I'll share with you some of
the quotes from the groups.

00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:50.700
The way we see things

00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:54.743
is affected by what we know or believe.

00:24:55.990 --> 00:24:59.090
This is important idea

00:24:59.090 --> 00:25:01.460
that was put forward in the early 1970s

00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:06.360
as part of this tradition from
a book called Ways of Seeing,

00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:09.840
that talked about the subjective nature

00:25:09.840 --> 00:25:13.250
of the way we experience
the social worlds around us,

00:25:13.250 --> 00:25:17.050
that it's not purely an objective process

00:25:17.050 --> 00:25:20.410
that can be measured uniformly

00:25:20.410 --> 00:25:22.660
across all viewers, all observers.

00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.670
In fact, observers bring
different materials

00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:26.540
to those encounters,

00:25:26.540 --> 00:25:28.550
and one of the important things they bring

00:25:28.550 --> 00:25:30.080
is intertextual memory.

00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:31.602
Thank you.

00:25:31.602 --> 00:25:32.435
(audience applauding)

00:25:32.435 --> 00:25:33.393
- Thank you Darnell.

00:25:33.393 --> 00:25:34.973
Everybody, Darnell Hunt.

00:25:38.810 --> 00:25:41.583
And our final presentation, Peter Sellars.

00:25:44.755 --> 00:25:47.672
(faintly speaking)

00:26:01.014 --> 00:26:02.870
- We'd be hot now, let's be hot.

00:26:02.870 --> 00:26:03.703
Okay.

00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.530
Thank you, deeply.

00:26:06.530 --> 00:26:08.110
My goodness.

00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:10.340
I am going to try and go through

00:26:10.340 --> 00:26:14.860
some of the same material but
.by a very circuitous route.

00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.960
And forgive me, but part
of my training as an artist

00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.610
is that the shortest
distance between two points

00:26:20.610 --> 00:26:22.210
means you didn't learn anything.

00:26:23.910 --> 00:26:27.340
And so, for me, the long way around

00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.880
is actually how life works,

00:26:29.880 --> 00:26:33.800
and what's not immediately
adjacent turns out to be,

00:26:33.800 --> 00:26:36.373
in fact, incredible close.

00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.670
That question where near
becomes and far becomes near

00:26:41.670 --> 00:26:43.470
is one of the main points of memory.

00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:49.620
And I would like to pick
up on several things.

00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.120
First of all, I want to thank Brett

00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.590
for making these evening.

00:26:53.590 --> 00:26:55.300
I'm so happy to meet these two people

00:26:55.300 --> 00:26:56.490
that I would not have known.

00:26:56.490 --> 00:26:58.210
I've been teaching at UCLA for 30 years.

00:26:58.210 --> 00:26:59.870
Hello, finally I'm meeting you tonight.

00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:00.703
Thank you.

00:27:01.940 --> 00:27:04.223
Thank you very much.

00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:10.490
Just to say, for me, the moral

00:27:11.410 --> 00:27:14.040
questions of memory are really profound,

00:27:14.040 --> 00:27:16.870
and I wanna deal with what we remember,

00:27:16.870 --> 00:27:18.813
what we actually deny,

00:27:19.970 --> 00:27:21.870
what we hold and cherish,

00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:23.250
and what we can't deal with,

00:27:23.250 --> 00:27:24.600
and how we don't deal with,

00:27:25.630 --> 00:27:28.123
and how memory operates
as an ethical system,

00:27:29.150 --> 00:27:31.160
and what memory actually has to be

00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:34.660
with the way you decide to live your life,

00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:38.100
which is two words that
are very important to me

00:27:38.100 --> 00:27:41.690
as a performer and somebody
who organizes performance,

00:27:41.690 --> 00:27:42.523
remember

00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:45.823
and repentance.

00:27:49.540 --> 00:27:51.240
What we do in performance

00:27:52.340 --> 00:27:56.120
is we take the voice of
those who are no longer here,

00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:59.447
and we give them new bodies, our own.

00:28:01.230 --> 00:28:03.990
And we invite other people

00:28:03.990 --> 00:28:05.870
to speak through us.

00:28:05.870 --> 00:28:08.180
We create a spirit possession.

00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:11.790
We create a moment in which our identity

00:28:11.790 --> 00:28:14.363
is suddenly blurred with another identity.

00:28:15.820 --> 00:28:17.820
And what I want to just mention tonight

00:28:18.870 --> 00:28:22.130
is a performance that I've just come from

00:28:22.130 --> 00:28:23.130
putting on in Madrid.

00:28:23.130 --> 00:28:25.210
It's still running for the next two weeks,

00:28:25.210 --> 00:28:26.660
anyone who's going to Madrid.

00:28:29.621 --> 00:28:31.870
Of two Japanese Noh plays,

00:28:31.870 --> 00:28:35.383
14th century Buddhist, Zen Buddhist plays.

00:28:36.530 --> 00:28:39.370
And we've titled the evening

00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.370
one of the lines from one of the plays,

00:28:42.370 --> 00:28:46.083
which is Only the Sound Remains.

00:28:49.010 --> 00:28:50.760
What it means when you lose someone

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.173
but you're remembering them all day,

00:28:56.530 --> 00:28:57.363
all night,

00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:01.523
and you're still in
conversation with them.

00:29:03.470 --> 00:29:05.100
Their physical presence is gone,

00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:06.500
but their voice is with you,

00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.293
and only the sound remains.

00:29:13.072 --> 00:29:15.293
In the way in which sound carries memory,

00:29:17.010 --> 00:29:20.163
the way in which a piece
of music carries memory,

00:29:21.150 --> 00:29:24.640
the way in which our
soundtrack all day long

00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:27.723
is actually the way we're
ordering our memories.

00:29:29.500 --> 00:29:31.760
And sound exactly because of it's fluidity

00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:34.103
and because of its non-material nature.

00:29:35.630 --> 00:29:39.923
The way it eludes any
attempt to organize it,

00:29:41.270 --> 00:29:44.003
the way voices flow
through your consciousness,

00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.343
who you still keep thinking of,

00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:54.280
and how that operates of course
in spiritual path because

00:29:54.280 --> 00:29:56.520
Jesus, and Buddha, and Muhammad

00:29:59.270 --> 00:30:00.103
are not here,

00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:04.523
but their voice remains with us.

00:30:08.490 --> 00:30:11.140
And then what it means to remember,

00:30:11.140 --> 00:30:16.140
that is to say Jesus is asking
you to embody his words,

00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:20.980
and you have to offer
your body to those voices

00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:23.123
and that speech,

00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.313
and walk in somebody else's footsteps,

00:30:28.930 --> 00:30:31.790
and actually begin to acknowledge

00:30:31.790 --> 00:30:33.883
that you're not alone and you're not,

00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:37.323
in fact, yourself.

00:30:39.911 --> 00:30:42.111
But all these voices
are moving through you,

00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.340
and inspiring your actions,
and inspiring your next moves,

00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:53.223
which is what brings me
to the word repentance,

00:30:54.200 --> 00:30:57.733
which is things we've all
done that we're not proud of,

00:30:59.550 --> 00:31:03.550
and we feel we have to live
our lives to make up for that

00:31:03.550 --> 00:31:05.483
to somehow make that good,

00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:09.060
and what it means that
you have certain memories

00:31:09.950 --> 00:31:12.673
that are very difficult,

00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:18.370
and you have to live in a way
that brings some equilibrium,

00:31:18.370 --> 00:31:20.883
some balance, and some justice.

00:31:22.840 --> 00:31:25.790
And the way justice operates in memory,

00:31:25.790 --> 00:31:29.373
where we know something
unjust has happened,

00:31:31.130 --> 00:31:33.280
and we live with that memory of injustice

00:31:34.610 --> 00:31:36.760
and what it means to live every day

00:31:36.760 --> 00:31:41.760
as a way to counteract those
memories and correct them.

00:31:44.090 --> 00:31:46.603
Or, the same way,

00:31:47.950 --> 00:31:52.200
moments of deep beauty in our
life that we're searching for

00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.513
to enhance and to allow them to flower.

00:32:01.770 --> 00:32:04.150
So I'm gonna just mention briefly,

00:32:04.150 --> 00:32:05.193
briefly with God,

00:32:06.791 --> 00:32:09.480
the Buddhist sense of store consciousness

00:32:11.500 --> 00:32:13.573
just to get at the zen place.

00:32:14.410 --> 00:32:16.380
And store consciousness is understanding

00:32:16.380 --> 00:32:18.780
that every single gesture you make

00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:20.290
and every thought you have,

00:32:20.290 --> 00:32:22.200
and every thing you say

00:32:23.940 --> 00:32:26.373
becomes a seed in your consciousness.

00:32:28.010 --> 00:32:30.200
And your consciousness
is all of those seeds

00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:32.363
planted across many, many lifetimes.

00:32:33.450 --> 00:32:36.790
And your life is which
seeds you choose to water

00:32:36.790 --> 00:32:37.830
and pay attention to

00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:41.700
or which seeds you
actually recognize as weeds

00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:44.563
and try to pull out by the roots,

00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:48.210
and what the garden of your life is

00:32:48.210 --> 00:32:51.250
is based on how you order your memories,

00:32:51.250 --> 00:32:54.503
which memories are the place
from which you want to grow,

00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:59.440
what is the tree that the
seed of a certain action

00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:01.563
results in across your whole lifetime.

00:33:04.020 --> 00:33:06.230
You make one action at
one moment in your life,

00:33:06.230 --> 00:33:08.663
and it becomes a tree
across your whole life,

00:33:09.560 --> 00:33:10.523
that seed.

00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:16.653
And to take something
you spoke of so movingly,

00:33:18.190 --> 00:33:20.703
which is that memories are not,

00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:24.873
are not frozen.

00:33:24.873 --> 00:33:26.780
It's quite the opposite, they're alive.

00:33:27.790 --> 00:33:30.700
And just to say if I ask
everybody in the room tonight

00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.170
to just have that memory and image,

00:33:33.170 --> 00:33:35.023
take a snapshot of your mother,

00:33:36.690 --> 00:33:41.603
and hold that image in
front of you now, tonight,

00:33:45.750 --> 00:33:48.470
and you will take an image from a moment,

00:33:48.470 --> 00:33:50.520
a powerful moment between the two of you.

00:33:52.020 --> 00:33:53.420
And you can see your mother.

00:33:56.130 --> 00:33:58.140
But as you hold that
image now in your mind,

00:33:58.140 --> 00:33:59.670
you see things you didn't see

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.593
at the time when you took that snapshot,

00:34:05.130 --> 00:34:06.950
because you know more
about your mother now

00:34:06.950 --> 00:34:10.133
than you did when that snapshot occurred,

00:34:11.060 --> 00:34:13.120
and you know a little
more about the context

00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:15.683
of what was going on than you knew then.

00:34:18.750 --> 00:34:20.810
So what happens is not only do that memory

00:34:20.810 --> 00:34:22.070
not remain stable,

00:34:22.070 --> 00:34:25.400
but you're adding to that
memory new information

00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.930
and new ways of understanding
and new perspectives,

00:34:28.930 --> 00:34:31.380
which you've showed so
beautifully in that graph.

00:34:32.720 --> 00:34:37.600
And what it means that every
single instant in your life

00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.793
is continuing to grow with you.

00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.340
And so not only does
memory not remain the past,

00:34:43.340 --> 00:34:48.340
but memory is no moment
remains its on separate self,

00:34:48.890 --> 00:34:52.920
but actually is transforming
and continues to grow.

00:34:52.920 --> 00:34:55.850
Every second in your life
continues to be active

00:34:56.690 --> 00:34:57.990
for the rest of your life.

00:35:00.270 --> 00:35:03.290
So the way we demonstrate that in theater

00:35:03.290 --> 00:35:07.860
is to actually step into other bodies

00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:10.970
and to move through

00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.540
images that allow us to deal with memory,

00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:22.520
and I would just say,
to quote Toni Morrison,

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.660
I think one of the most
powerful images as ghosts

00:35:25.660 --> 00:35:28.250
is recognizing that
we're haunted by ghosts,

00:35:28.250 --> 00:35:31.130
that ghost that are part
of all of our lives.

00:35:31.130 --> 00:35:34.420
And in the arts, the ghosts frequently,

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.490
a powerful way that you can

00:35:36.490 --> 00:35:38.630
actually give form to a memory

00:35:39.750 --> 00:35:41.883
that is otherwise extremely elusive.

00:35:43.860 --> 00:35:46.580
Japanese Noh theater invented in the,

00:35:46.580 --> 00:35:49.660
in basically the 1300s,

00:35:49.660 --> 00:35:52.573
at a high moment of zen, culture.

00:35:54.190 --> 00:35:56.333
The place all have the same structure.

00:35:57.750 --> 00:36:00.230
A wandering priest

00:36:01.530 --> 00:36:03.370
goes through a certain landscape,

00:36:03.370 --> 00:36:04.560
and the first part of the play

00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:08.820
is a very specific tracing
of a geography, of a journey,

00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.280
real place names,

00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:12.580
what the temperature is,
what the water is like there,

00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:14.490
what the sky was, what the weather was.

00:36:14.490 --> 00:36:17.480
All this detail of tracing a journey

00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:20.023
and trying to retrace a footstep.

00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:25.870
And then the priest
arrives at a place where

00:36:25.870 --> 00:36:28.347
he decides, "I'd like to stay here."

00:36:29.870 --> 00:36:32.683
Sits down, see someone raking leaves.

00:36:35.690 --> 00:36:38.137
Asks the person who's raking leaves,

00:36:38.137 --> 00:36:40.377
"What happened in this place?"

00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:45.763
That's part one of the play.

00:36:47.260 --> 00:36:49.400
Part two of the play

00:36:49.400 --> 00:36:53.940
is the spirit of the person
raking leaves returns,

00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:55.800
but now as a spirit

00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.833
in a whole new costume and mask,

00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.840
and dances out

00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:08.780
that she was a warrior
who dressed in armor,

00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:10.710
people didn't know who she was,

00:37:10.710 --> 00:37:13.340
and she was killed at this spot,

00:37:13.340 --> 00:37:15.640
and the person who killed
her was her husband.

00:37:19.630 --> 00:37:21.243
And that was 700 years ago.

00:37:23.710 --> 00:37:26.533
And that is the person
raking leaves here today,

00:37:27.520 --> 00:37:32.373
because the spirit is trapped
here in this place forever.

00:37:36.410 --> 00:37:38.253
And then the spirit disappears.

00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:48.220
And the quality of understanding

00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:50.160
that not only do human
beings have a memory,

00:37:50.160 --> 00:37:52.023
but places have memories,

00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:57.000
and that trauma, or moments of
exceptional beauty in a place

00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:01.580
live on through the people
who live in that place,

00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.510
and that trauma is not over with

00:38:03.510 --> 00:38:05.290
at one historical moment,

00:38:05.290 --> 00:38:07.670
but actually across centuries.

00:38:07.670 --> 00:38:11.080
That trauma repeats itself and affects

00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:12.793
people in a certain place.

00:38:14.920 --> 00:38:17.210
And also moments of beauty

00:38:18.170 --> 00:38:19.243
and moments of truth.

00:38:21.830 --> 00:38:24.120
So, the play that I'm

00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:31.080
dealing with is called
Tsunemasa in Japanese,

00:38:32.150 --> 00:38:35.780
and it's a priest who makes a ceremony

00:38:35.780 --> 00:38:38.640
for a young man who died in battle,

00:38:38.640 --> 00:38:40.440
because this young man killed someone

00:38:40.440 --> 00:38:41.713
and then was killed.

00:38:43.570 --> 00:38:46.393
And the young man I think
is the priest's lover.

00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:51.420
But in Asia, in many Buddhist cultures,

00:38:51.420 --> 00:38:52.930
there's a formal practice of

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.640
when somebody leaves the world in pain,

00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:58.873
when someone leaves the world
in terrible circumstances,

00:39:00.310 --> 00:39:02.510
you make a ceremony for their spirit

00:39:02.510 --> 00:39:05.450
one year after their death

00:39:05.450 --> 00:39:08.040
and three years after their death,

00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:12.290
because nobody wants angry
spirits and hurt spirits

00:39:12.290 --> 00:39:15.343
wandering around because
it's terrible for everyone.

00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:19.260
And you create a ceremony
to call back the spirit

00:39:19.260 --> 00:39:21.977
of the person who's gone and say,

00:39:21.977 --> 00:39:24.907
"You died horribly, and we know that,

00:39:24.907 --> 00:39:27.620
"and we have to acknowledge your sadness."

00:39:27.620 --> 00:39:29.700
We have to acknowledge the injustice,

00:39:29.700 --> 00:39:31.270
we have to acknowledge all the things

00:39:31.270 --> 00:39:33.470
that were not acknowledged
in your lifetime.

00:39:34.890 --> 00:39:37.253
We have to let you know, we remember you,

00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:42.823
and we want to make
good what was very bad.

00:39:43.690 --> 00:39:46.240
We want to make just what was unjust.

00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:48.110
We wanna offer you the compassion

00:39:48.110 --> 00:39:49.910
and love that you did not feel then,

00:39:50.870 --> 00:39:52.653
and we're gonna create a ceremony.

00:39:55.260 --> 00:39:57.610
And of course the beginning of theater,

00:39:57.610 --> 00:40:00.170
the invention of the performing arts

00:40:00.170 --> 00:40:03.453
in most cultures is
performing for the dead,

00:40:04.670 --> 00:40:07.250
is actually the reason we perform

00:40:07.250 --> 00:40:09.393
is to tell the dead we remember them,

00:40:10.440 --> 00:40:14.273
to ask them to remember us kindly,

00:40:15.370 --> 00:40:18.070
better than we deserve to be remembered,

00:40:18.070 --> 00:40:20.290
ask them to favor us,

00:40:20.290 --> 00:40:23.030
and to somehow put back into balance

00:40:23.030 --> 00:40:25.600
something that is deeply out of balance.

00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.380
And we can't live another day

00:40:28.390 --> 00:40:30.733
with a memory of what was wrong.

00:40:32.490 --> 00:40:35.230
This play begins, is that ceremony,

00:40:35.230 --> 00:40:39.343
and the spirit of this deeply
damaged young man comes back.

00:40:40.480 --> 00:40:45.173
And it's a harrowing middle of the night.

00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:49.450
And finally, the young man has to

00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.380
return back into another world because

00:40:54.870 --> 00:40:58.280
the spirits can't make it
through the earth's atmosphere.

00:40:58.280 --> 00:40:59.880
Only the voices

00:41:01.090 --> 00:41:02.090
can make it through.

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:06.963
And if I could quote the
Ezra Pound translation.

00:41:16.270 --> 00:41:19.960
I perceive no form but a voice.

00:41:19.960 --> 00:41:20.877
And the spirit says,

00:41:20.877 --> 00:41:23.967
"It is the faint sound
alone that remains."

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.707
The priest says, "But
I saw the form really."

00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:31.887
The spirit says, "It is
there if you see it."

00:41:35.150 --> 00:41:37.137
The priest says, "I can see."

00:41:39.890 --> 00:41:43.507
The spirit says, "Are you
sure you see it, really?"

00:41:46.260 --> 00:41:49.163
The priest says, "Oh,

00:41:50.047 --> 00:41:53.087
"do I or do I not see you?"

00:41:58.130 --> 00:42:03.130
The chorus takes over
for this ghost's voice.

00:42:03.442 --> 00:42:08.173
Changeful Tsunemasa, full of
the universal unstillness,

00:42:09.610 --> 00:42:11.593
looked back upon the world.

00:42:13.150 --> 00:42:14.963
His voice was heard there,

00:42:16.070 --> 00:42:17.653
a voice without form.

00:42:19.060 --> 00:42:20.803
None might see him,

00:42:22.010 --> 00:42:25.093
but he looked out from his phantom world,

00:42:26.270 --> 00:42:27.103
a dream

00:42:28.250 --> 00:42:31.533
that gazed on our world.

00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:36.727
The priest says, "It is strange.

00:42:36.727 --> 00:42:39.527
"The figure was there and is gone.

00:42:39.527 --> 00:42:42.223
"Only the thin sound remains.

00:42:43.067 --> 00:42:47.507
"The film of a dream, perhaps."

00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:58.973
And then the spirit
returns to the other world.

00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:05.410
And these lines by the
great Japanese poet, Theami,

00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:09.233
conclude the play.

00:43:12.040 --> 00:43:14.670
And I don't mean to
emphasize what's negative,

00:43:14.670 --> 00:43:16.850
but I tend to feel that most people live

00:43:16.850 --> 00:43:20.480
with so many regrets, so many things that

00:43:20.480 --> 00:43:22.940
deeply, deeply at the core of your being

00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:24.577
you're trying to compensate for.

00:43:27.530 --> 00:43:29.780
And again, I just can't thank you enough

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.563
for bringing up the LA Uprising,

00:43:34.510 --> 00:43:36.090
and for what it means when

00:43:36.090 --> 00:43:39.030
something that was never ever
even acknowledged correctly

00:43:39.030 --> 00:43:41.003
is then further misremembered.

00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:46.113
But in fact, it's a moment of sorrow.

00:43:47.040 --> 00:43:48.480
It's a moment of deep sorrow

00:43:48.480 --> 00:43:51.073
that makes a deep impression on us.

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:56.570
These are the last words of the play,

00:43:56.570 --> 00:43:59.053
which by the way is 3 1/2 pages long.

00:44:02.130 --> 00:44:04.400
And the performance takes

00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:07.513
90 minutes or two hours.

00:44:09.550 --> 00:44:14.550
So the material is just you
live inside this material

00:44:14.920 --> 00:44:16.720
the same way you live inside your memory

00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.600
that something took a second in real life,

00:44:19.600 --> 00:44:22.240
and you spent weeks
arguing with that person

00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:23.140
once they're gone,

00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.797
and going back to that
conversation and said,

00:44:25.797 --> 00:44:27.950
"What do they mean when they said this?"

00:44:27.950 --> 00:44:29.380
And they said, "No, but they misheard me,"

00:44:29.380 --> 00:44:34.380
and you replay everything for
weeks, and months, and years

00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.853
that in real life took seconds.

00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:44.820
That's the way the Japanese
invented this form of theater,

00:44:44.820 --> 00:44:46.340
what it means that something that happened

00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:50.850
for a second in your life
has this endless existence,

00:44:50.850 --> 00:44:53.313
and goes at the infinite time and space.

00:44:55.930 --> 00:45:00.930
The sorrow of the heart
is a spreading around

00:45:01.590 --> 00:45:03.253
of quick fires.

00:45:07.130 --> 00:45:09.040
Think of your beautiful arbors.

00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:14.630
The sorrow of the heart
is a spreading around

00:45:14.630 --> 00:45:17.093
of quick fires.

00:45:19.170 --> 00:45:23.313
The flames are turned to thick rain.

00:45:30.470 --> 00:45:31.790
The sorrow of the heart

00:45:31.790 --> 00:45:34.960
is a spreading around of quick fires.

00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:37.573
The flames are turned into rain.

00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:43.120
He slew by the sword and the slain.

00:45:43.120 --> 00:45:47.690
The red wave of blood rows in fire,

00:45:47.690 --> 00:45:50.643
and now he buns with that flame.

00:45:56.010 --> 00:45:58.100
He bade us, "Put out the light."

00:45:58.100 --> 00:46:00.977
Oh, the last word of the spirit was,

00:46:00.977 --> 00:46:02.667
"It's a sorry face that I make here.

00:46:02.667 --> 00:46:04.777
"Put down the lights if you see me."

00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:11.770
He bade us, "Put out the lights."

00:46:11.770 --> 00:46:14.133
He flew as a summer moth.

00:46:16.030 --> 00:46:19.313
His brushing wings were storm.

00:46:22.110 --> 00:46:24.713
His spirit is gone in the darkness.

00:46:30.030 --> 00:46:33.300
So we're talking about
living with the sound

00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.443
of those brushing wings in the dark.

00:46:38.745 --> 00:46:41.495
(all applauding)

00:46:43.138 --> 00:46:44.790
- Thank you.

00:46:44.790 --> 00:46:46.410
Peter, Kelsey, Darnell, thank you

00:46:46.410 --> 00:46:47.910
each for those presentations.

00:46:47.910 --> 00:46:49.730
I think as we did last week,

00:46:49.730 --> 00:46:51.520
let's take two minutes

00:46:53.020 --> 00:46:53.880
to take a deep breath,

00:46:53.880 --> 00:46:56.310
stand up, shake yourself
out if you'd like.

00:46:56.310 --> 00:46:59.360
Lean over to the neighbor
that you're sitting next to

00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:01.550
or someone behind you.

00:47:01.550 --> 00:47:03.073
Share a thought with them,

00:47:04.360 --> 00:47:06.590
ask a question, hear their response.

00:47:06.590 --> 00:47:08.180
We can do the same up here,

00:47:08.180 --> 00:47:10.290
and we'll come back online
in about two minutes.

00:47:10.290 --> 00:47:11.260
Thank you.

00:47:11.260 --> 00:47:12.410
Thank you everyone.

00:47:12.410 --> 00:47:14.890
After those three terrific presentations,

00:47:14.890 --> 00:47:18.000
what I've just suggested to
our three guests this evening

00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.480
is maybe open the conversation
up between the three of them,

00:47:21.480 --> 00:47:23.100
having now seen the presentations

00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:24.557
by your fellow guest this evening.

00:47:24.557 --> 00:47:27.353
And I'm gonna turn it over to
the three of you for a minute.

00:47:28.410 --> 00:47:29.960
- Well, there's one thing that I,

00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.920
listening to my colleagues talk,

00:47:32.920 --> 00:47:34.160
that I was thinking about,

00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:35.670
and I'd like to hear your thoughts about,

00:47:35.670 --> 00:47:36.620
and it has to do with,

00:47:36.620 --> 00:47:38.020
we've been talking about remembering,

00:47:38.020 --> 00:47:40.093
but part of remembering is forgetting.

00:47:43.410 --> 00:47:45.293
What does that mean to forget?

00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:51.020
I know from study, from
biology of memory studies,

00:47:51.020 --> 00:47:53.430
that we don't really forget,

00:47:53.430 --> 00:47:55.700
that we think we forget,

00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.490
but there are these
memories that are present

00:47:58.490 --> 00:48:01.263
that will come out, and that
we're not even aware of.

00:48:02.120 --> 00:48:03.680
There's something called inhibition

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.170
that gets placed on top of those memories.

00:48:06.170 --> 00:48:07.680
And then in a certain situation,

00:48:07.680 --> 00:48:11.180
that might come away,
and it's actually there.

00:48:11.180 --> 00:48:12.910
So I like to just talk for a moment about

00:48:12.910 --> 00:48:14.460
forgetting and what that means.

00:48:15.680 --> 00:48:18.000
- That's an interesting question.

00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:19.910
When I was conducting the study

00:48:19.910 --> 00:48:22.833
that I referred briefly a few moments ago,

00:48:24.190 --> 00:48:27.140
one of the things I was
trying to explore was

00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:30.310
sort of how when people
get together in a group

00:48:30.310 --> 00:48:34.340
they collectively negotiate
the meaning of something.

00:48:34.340 --> 00:48:37.190
And one of the theories

00:48:37.190 --> 00:48:39.380
called informational influence is that

00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:43.020
when you're in a group and there's kind of

00:48:45.710 --> 00:48:48.610
a dominant understanding of something,

00:48:48.610 --> 00:48:51.250
the question is what happens
when the group discusses it.

00:48:51.250 --> 00:48:54.000
Well, there's something
called group polarization

00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:56.670
where the view can even
become more dominant over time

00:48:56.670 --> 00:48:59.680
as people are reinforcing
one another's understandings.

00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:03.360
And one of the arguments
for how that happens

00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.130
is something called informational
influence theory that,

00:49:06.130 --> 00:49:07.470
people who come to the group

00:49:07.470 --> 00:49:09.470
with a predisposition towards seeing

00:49:09.470 --> 00:49:11.290
something in a certain way

00:49:11.290 --> 00:49:14.300
may have forgotten some of the arguments

00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:15.550
to support that position.

00:49:15.550 --> 00:49:17.577
But when they get around
people like themselves,

00:49:17.577 --> 00:49:19.940
and they hear that information again,

00:49:19.940 --> 00:49:21.810
they're like, "Aha, that's right."

00:49:21.810 --> 00:49:24.220
And they actually harden their

00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.740
adherence to that point of view.

00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:27.830
So this is something that I actually found

00:49:27.830 --> 00:49:29.280
in all the groups I study.

00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:31.510
Most of the groups, if you sort of

00:49:32.430 --> 00:49:34.910
did this quasi experimental
thing where you measured

00:49:34.910 --> 00:49:36.620
kind of where they were on a scale

00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:38.520
when they first came to the meeting,

00:49:38.520 --> 00:49:40.260
by the end, they're way over here.

00:49:40.260 --> 00:49:41.370
And this was true in every group,

00:49:41.370 --> 00:49:43.430
and the scales will go
in different directions,

00:49:43.430 --> 00:49:47.170
depending upon the basic
understanding of the group.

00:49:47.170 --> 00:49:48.940
And so forgetting was a big part of that,

00:49:48.940 --> 00:49:50.690
and then remembering,
once it was brought up

00:49:50.690 --> 00:49:51.790
in group conversation.

00:49:54.610 --> 00:49:58.260
- One of the ethical issues
for me so much right now,

00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:00.150
in America right now, is this

00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.260
in order to create the mythical golden age

00:50:03.260 --> 00:50:05.280
that a bunch of people
keep wanting to create.

00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:08.370
That's only possible if you
forget a whole lot of stuff.

00:50:08.370 --> 00:50:11.130
(all laughs)

00:50:11.130 --> 00:50:13.620
And that forgetting is highly organized,

00:50:13.620 --> 00:50:16.670
and you decide what
things are inconvenient,

00:50:16.670 --> 00:50:20.590
and they are just erased while
you create out of memory,

00:50:20.590 --> 00:50:23.363
something super evil called nostalgia,

00:50:24.430 --> 00:50:27.310
in which something was never true.

00:50:27.310 --> 00:50:31.750
But you're damn sugarcoating,
and golden glow,

00:50:31.750 --> 00:50:33.820
and extr maple syrup,

00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:38.110
create something where the
original taste is actually gone,

00:50:38.110 --> 00:50:42.330
and something has morphed
into a wish fulfillment of

00:50:45.050 --> 00:50:48.583
something that supports your
own sense of superiority.

00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.557
And you can say, "I'm on top of this,

00:50:52.557 --> 00:50:56.951
"and I know when there was good time,

00:50:56.951 --> 00:51:00.180
"and this isn't it."

00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:04.110
And conveniently choose to not include

00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:08.260
not only what was happening
to other people then,

00:51:08.260 --> 00:51:09.910
but what you were actually doing,

00:51:10.940 --> 00:51:13.113
and what the implications of that are.

00:51:13.950 --> 00:51:18.860
And so, for me, that total
constructed forgetting

00:51:18.860 --> 00:51:20.480
is a pretty intense thing,

00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:22.810
and we're seeing it all
over the world right now,

00:51:22.810 --> 00:51:27.653
and we're seeing it as
a nightmare epidemic.

00:51:28.863 --> 00:51:30.960
- I think that's one of
the reasons why we see

00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.010
different groups bringing
different memories

00:51:33.010 --> 00:51:36.870
to these encounters, because
the experiences are different.

00:51:36.870 --> 00:51:39.830
And someone may experience something as

00:51:39.830 --> 00:51:42.560
the good old times are great in many ways.

00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:47.250
And they can do this because
they are relatively privileged

00:51:47.250 --> 00:51:48.350
in that particular moment,

00:51:48.350 --> 00:51:50.330
and other people of course
wouldn't see it that way,

00:51:50.330 --> 00:51:52.490
so they would bring other
memories to the encounter.

00:51:52.490 --> 00:51:57.264
And so we see a lot of
this in the study I did,

00:51:57.264 --> 00:51:58.490
it was 1992.

00:51:58.490 --> 00:51:59.880
I mean the whole question
of whether not it is a,

00:51:59.880 --> 00:52:02.050
quote unquote, riot versus rebellion

00:52:02.050 --> 00:52:07.050
differ very sharply, depending
upon those backgrounds

00:52:07.570 --> 00:52:09.740
and the experiences
that people brought in.

00:52:09.740 --> 00:52:13.680
A lot of the black informants in the study

00:52:15.110 --> 00:52:18.810
saw this as a chance for
the voiceless to be heard

00:52:18.810 --> 00:52:21.653
in ways that they
couldn't be heard before.

00:52:23.052 --> 00:52:25.780
Other groups of course brought in memories

00:52:27.336 --> 00:52:29.320
that sparked fears of various sorts.

00:52:29.320 --> 00:52:31.590
And this was to be avoided.

00:52:31.590 --> 00:52:33.460
It was definitely a riot,

00:52:33.460 --> 00:52:35.850
which if you look at
the definition of riot,

00:52:35.850 --> 00:52:40.420
senseless, it doesn't
really have any basis

00:52:40.420 --> 00:52:45.150
in terms of moving us
in a positive direction.

00:52:45.150 --> 00:52:47.210
And so there were very
different takes on this,

00:52:47.210 --> 00:52:49.430
based on the memories that
people brought to bear.

00:52:49.430 --> 00:52:52.520
And I think that, for me at least,

00:52:52.520 --> 00:52:54.850
it fits very nicely with
the way you're kind of

00:52:54.850 --> 00:52:57.490
articulating this whole idea of nostalgia

00:52:59.498 --> 00:53:03.090
and differential, I guess,

00:53:03.090 --> 00:53:06.170
value that groups places on the past,

00:53:06.170 --> 00:53:07.720
on different parts of the past.

00:53:10.790 --> 00:53:14.433
- Again, I was just so
moved by these diagrams.

00:53:15.994 --> 00:53:18.233
- Micrograph, not diagrams.

00:53:18.233 --> 00:53:21.330
It's real biology.
(all laughs)

00:53:21.330 --> 00:53:22.890
I think of graph is like something

00:53:22.890 --> 00:53:24.870
that somebody drew or made up.

00:53:24.870 --> 00:53:28.342
These are like, this is
what's in your brain.

00:53:28.342 --> 00:53:30.759
(all laughs)

00:53:31.770 --> 00:53:32.850
- At a moment in time.

00:53:32.850 --> 00:53:34.960
I mean one of the points that
you brought to immediately

00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:35.830
is the idea of,

00:53:35.830 --> 00:53:38.710
if memory is anything, it's
a fundamentally dynamic--

00:53:38.710 --> 00:53:40.930
- Changing all the time, always changing.

00:53:40.930 --> 00:53:43.170
And I even, you know when you talk about

00:53:43.170 --> 00:53:46.970
the play of a woman remembering

00:53:48.130 --> 00:53:50.850
700 years ago,

00:53:50.850 --> 00:53:53.030
I can't help, but I really do feel like

00:53:53.030 --> 00:53:55.180
a total scientific geek.

00:53:55.180 --> 00:53:58.440
But I think about the fact that there are

00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.150
these things called epigenetic marks

00:54:01.150 --> 00:54:03.350
that go from generation to generation

00:54:03.350 --> 00:54:06.160
actually change the way that your DNA

00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:10.530
is marked by your past ancestry
and your past experiences.

00:54:10.530 --> 00:54:13.493
It's gonna change the way that
that whole circuitry works.

00:54:14.554 --> 00:54:18.210
And of course I'm saying
that as if okay, so,

00:54:18.210 --> 00:54:19.830
I recognize as a scientist,

00:54:19.830 --> 00:54:22.100
we're also making up
stories about what we see.

00:54:22.100 --> 00:54:23.880
I showed you that picture of those

00:54:25.030 --> 00:54:28.060
neurons that Ramon y Cajal looked at

00:54:28.060 --> 00:54:29.270
over a hundred years ago.

00:54:29.270 --> 00:54:31.630
He made up a story about
what was going on there.

00:54:31.630 --> 00:54:33.720
Another person saw it and
made a different story.

00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:35.680
It turns out that Ramon y Cajal

00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.660
was right about the story that he made.

00:54:38.660 --> 00:54:40.270
So it's this kind of interplay

00:54:40.270 --> 00:54:42.380
between what we think is real biology,

00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.080
what we know in the story we're
telling ourselves about it.

00:54:45.080 --> 00:54:46.920
- [Darnell] It's the
social and the biological.

00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.177
- Yeah, and it's sort of a metaphor.

00:54:49.177 --> 00:54:51.470
For me, I listen to that and I go,

00:54:51.470 --> 00:54:52.960
oh, that's epigenetics,

00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:57.060
that transgenerational
long history that we have

00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:57.893
as human beings.

00:55:00.560 --> 00:55:03.870
- I was truck also by the three billion

00:55:03.870 --> 00:55:06.920
perspectives at which you
approach the question.

00:55:06.920 --> 00:55:08.810
The degree to which your own creative

00:55:08.810 --> 00:55:11.640
and professional fields are themselves,

00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:13.570
the kinds of memory structures

00:55:13.570 --> 00:55:16.133
for the holding of ideas.

00:55:17.690 --> 00:55:20.250
Ideas about memory in this case.

00:55:20.250 --> 00:55:25.250
Your hundred year quick
summary of brain sciences,

00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:29.203
your field is also the
repository of those ideas.

00:55:32.110 --> 00:55:35.600
- It's one of the things that
I really love about science

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:39.330
is that it all builds upon

00:55:39.330 --> 00:55:41.650
discoveries that others make.

00:55:41.650 --> 00:55:43.770
It's always building upon discovery

00:55:43.770 --> 00:55:47.360
or enabling technology or
something, learn something.

00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:49.740
Sometimes it's wrong
and you have to learn,

00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.709
oh that was,

00:55:50.709 --> 00:55:51.542
(laughs)

00:55:51.542 --> 00:55:53.050
and you have to go another direction,

00:55:53.050 --> 00:55:55.760
so you can go down the wrong
pathway if you think that

00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:58.763
things are written in stone in a textbook,

00:56:00.227 --> 00:56:01.810
but it does build on.

00:56:01.810 --> 00:56:04.460
It's Newton's, you stand
on the shoulders of giants

00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.360
and you see you further because of that.

00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:09.240
To me that's a pretty remarkable

00:56:10.586 --> 00:56:11.760
adventure.
- The Japanese

00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:14.030
Noh version of that

00:56:14.030 --> 00:56:16.480
is that this year's flowers

00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:19.623
came from last year's seeds.

00:56:21.308 --> 00:56:22.443
- [Kelsey] It's beautiful.

00:56:22.443 --> 00:56:25.293
- And that it's this completely ongoing,

00:56:26.230 --> 00:56:29.880
and it's a continuous transition,

00:56:29.880 --> 00:56:32.650
and it doesn't end.

00:56:32.650 --> 00:56:36.150
And the more deeply you look into...

00:56:37.020 --> 00:56:40.073
Again, if you're looking
for your great grandmother,

00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:43.623
look into the eyes of your granddaughter.

00:56:45.590 --> 00:56:47.930
That's really what we're seeing,

00:56:47.930 --> 00:56:49.913
is this deep continuity,

00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:53.990
and this sense that something
is not just evolving,

00:56:53.990 --> 00:56:56.920
but it actually is reaching

00:56:58.140 --> 00:57:00.933
in very profound ways across generations.

00:57:02.550 --> 00:57:05.190
And I think just living with thoughts

00:57:05.190 --> 00:57:07.290
that are not your own in the same way,

00:57:07.290 --> 00:57:09.190
your eyes are also not your own,

00:57:09.190 --> 00:57:11.640
and your ears are your grandfather.

00:57:11.640 --> 00:57:13.530
You're actually carrying around with you

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.623
a lot of stuff that's not just you.

00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.703
And that is extremely powerful.

00:57:22.420 --> 00:57:24.810
- It is a pretty

00:57:27.160 --> 00:57:28.720
prominent theater, film,

00:57:28.720 --> 00:57:33.180
and television professor
here at UCLA years ago that

00:57:33.180 --> 00:57:35.230
influenced my thinking about

00:57:35.230 --> 00:57:36.830
the way people engaged with media.

00:57:36.830 --> 00:57:38.650
His name Teshome Gabriel.

00:57:38.650 --> 00:57:40.800
- [Peter] Oh my god, you're kidding.

00:57:40.800 --> 00:57:41.800
- I'm not kidding.

00:57:41.800 --> 00:57:43.330
- [Peter] Teshome is the greatest.

00:57:43.330 --> 00:57:44.540
- Yeah, he's amazing.

00:57:44.540 --> 00:57:46.030
- Excuse me, may we have a

00:57:46.030 --> 00:57:47.560
memorial service for Teshome tonight?

00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:48.510
- [Darnell] That's right, that's right.

00:57:48.510 --> 00:57:50.570
- Thank you Teshome Gabriel.

00:57:50.570 --> 00:57:52.710
Oh my goodness, thank you.

00:57:52.710 --> 00:57:53.900
Thank you.

00:57:53.900 --> 00:57:57.540
- Yeah, he introduced me to
British culture studies actually

00:57:57.540 --> 00:57:58.813
as I was trying to get my hands around

00:57:58.813 --> 00:58:00.790
this whole idea of meaning construction.

00:58:00.790 --> 00:58:03.490
I'm trying to find the quote
from him actually that...

00:58:03.490 --> 00:58:06.223
I remember the gist of it,
but I wanna get it right.

00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:10.030
He basically said that...

00:58:11.170 --> 00:58:12.320
Let's see, where is it?

00:58:13.693 --> 00:58:15.560
(mumbles)

00:58:15.560 --> 00:58:16.393
Okay.

00:58:19.630 --> 00:58:20.830
Here we go.

00:58:20.830 --> 00:58:21.850
He said,

00:58:21.850 --> 00:58:25.210
so he was interested in
basically the conditions

00:58:25.210 --> 00:58:27.483
confronted my marginalized
groups in society.

00:58:28.908 --> 00:58:32.130
And the ways in which those conditions

00:58:32.130 --> 00:58:34.447
lead to the creation of what
you call the collective memory,

00:58:34.447 --> 00:58:36.340
and it kinda goes to the
point you were making

00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.830
about the memories that we carry with us

00:58:38.830 --> 00:58:41.080
that linger for years.

00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.900
And these memories can often deviate

00:58:42.900 --> 00:58:44.930
from the official history that

00:58:44.930 --> 00:58:46.820
certain groups that are in control

00:58:48.050 --> 00:58:50.520
are able to kind of encode

00:58:50.520 --> 00:58:52.720
certain understandings of the past.

00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.620
And he said this memory, quote,

00:58:55.620 --> 00:58:58.870
decisively frames the
production and reception

00:58:58.870 --> 00:59:01.910
of commercial culture for these groups.

00:59:01.910 --> 00:59:05.570
And despite dominant efforts
to privilege certain meanings,

00:59:05.570 --> 00:59:07.660
the meanings associated society

00:59:07.660 --> 00:59:09.990
are never completely suture.

00:59:09.990 --> 00:59:13.650
And so his argument
was that we are always,

00:59:13.650 --> 00:59:16.077
because of the experiences we encounter

00:59:16.077 --> 00:59:17.770
and the groups to which we belong,

00:59:17.770 --> 00:59:19.730
particularly marginalized groups,

00:59:19.730 --> 00:59:21.820
able to overcome those dominant messages

00:59:21.820 --> 00:59:23.600
by the memories we
bring to the encounters.

00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:25.380
And that's kind of what
I was trying to explore

00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:27.110
with the LA uprisings,

00:59:27.110 --> 00:59:29.400
and the way different
groups were interpreting

00:59:29.400 --> 00:59:32.693
the same official news
text of that evening.

00:59:35.250 --> 00:59:37.500
- And what it means when we move through

00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:39.400
different geographies

00:59:39.400 --> 00:59:42.700
which of course shape our entire way we

00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:44.150
are living in our body.

00:59:44.150 --> 00:59:45.960
And one of the deepest things that Teshome

00:59:45.960 --> 00:59:49.070
was able to demonstrate
over and over again

00:59:49.070 --> 00:59:52.080
in his third cinema is this idea that

00:59:52.080 --> 00:59:55.980
as people are moving across
different phases of their lives,

00:59:55.980 --> 00:59:59.500
if you've had to reinvent
yourself four times

00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.120
in order to be where you are now,

01:00:02.120 --> 01:00:05.683
the way you read everyone
else's story is different,

01:00:06.520 --> 01:00:08.110
because you've actually had to tell

01:00:08.110 --> 01:00:10.010
a lot of different stories.

01:00:10.010 --> 01:00:13.490
And your story has not been
allowed to be the same,

01:00:13.490 --> 01:00:15.610
because in America, for example,

01:00:15.610 --> 01:00:17.710
with immigration and refugees,

01:00:17.710 --> 01:00:20.703
we only allow three stories to be told.

01:00:21.690 --> 01:00:23.210
And if you tell one of those stories,

01:00:23.210 --> 01:00:25.030
you have a chance of getting in.

01:00:25.030 --> 01:00:28.160
And so, people have to actually
falsify their experience

01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:29.643
at the immigration interview,

01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.760
because whatever actually happened to you

01:00:33.760 --> 01:00:34.913
is not on the list.

01:00:37.052 --> 01:00:40.320
And Teshome's brilliance is that how many

01:00:40.320 --> 01:00:43.360
ways people have learned
to tell their story

01:00:43.360 --> 01:00:45.930
and have learned to remember

01:00:45.930 --> 01:00:48.683
things that have been deliberately erased,

01:00:49.590 --> 01:00:52.090
erased by the culture
that's surrounding them.

01:00:52.090 --> 01:00:55.770
And how do you keep those
things alive not only in memory,

01:00:55.770 --> 01:00:58.800
but then translate your
memory into practice.

01:00:58.800 --> 01:01:00.970
And that's a really powerful thing

01:01:00.970 --> 01:01:03.350
that we're living with right now.

01:01:03.350 --> 01:01:04.283
- [Darnell] Definitely.

01:01:06.370 --> 01:01:08.120
- I think we're gonna
open the conversation up

01:01:08.120 --> 01:01:09.850
to the entire room as we've done before.

01:01:09.850 --> 01:01:13.010
I think we have some microphones

01:01:13.010 --> 01:01:15.083
out and about and over here on the side.

01:01:22.730 --> 01:01:24.360
- You sort of answered my question

01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:26.210
a little bit in that last discussion,

01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:30.410
but I was curious about
we live in a time where

01:01:30.410 --> 01:01:32.250
information is mass produced

01:01:32.250 --> 01:01:34.720
and mitigated on an unprecedented scale

01:01:34.720 --> 01:01:37.760
through social media and the internet.

01:01:37.760 --> 01:01:38.593
And so in some ways,

01:01:38.593 --> 01:01:40.810
we have so much more access

01:01:40.810 --> 01:01:43.853
to different kinds of collective
memory or personal memory.

01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.870
But I feel like that
mitigation also impacts

01:01:47.870 --> 01:01:50.690
what we were discussing
about the culture circuit

01:01:50.690 --> 01:01:51.857
and intertextual memory.

01:01:51.857 --> 01:01:53.730
And so how do we facilitate

01:01:54.590 --> 01:01:56.660
more of those conversation
where people come together

01:01:56.660 --> 01:01:57.740
and they bring their different

01:01:57.740 --> 01:01:59.450
interpretations of events.

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.820
And instead of being polarized or hardened

01:02:01.820 --> 01:02:04.483
into their former belief, they are,

01:02:05.550 --> 01:02:08.300
that plasticity is encouraged.

01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.200
And I guess I was just wandering

01:02:09.200 --> 01:02:11.397
what all of your perspectives on that are.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:15.220
- Well, maybe I'll take
the first stab at that.

01:02:15.220 --> 01:02:17.130
That's a great question.

01:02:17.130 --> 01:02:22.130
I think one of the reason why
when I was asked to do this

01:02:22.210 --> 01:02:24.170
that I picked this particular example

01:02:24.170 --> 01:02:26.330
is because I mean it's an old example.

01:02:26.330 --> 01:02:28.880
It comes from 25 years ago.

01:02:28.880 --> 01:02:32.570
But for me, it really
speaks to the present moment

01:02:32.570 --> 01:02:37.570
in terms of the siloization
of our culture in many ways,

01:02:38.100 --> 01:02:40.910
the ways in which mini groups

01:02:40.910 --> 01:02:42.330
who are living in these echo chambers

01:02:42.330 --> 01:02:46.560
where they're only hearing
ideas and thoughts that

01:02:46.560 --> 01:02:48.520
reinforce their predispositions,

01:02:48.520 --> 01:02:50.510
and there aren't as many opportunities

01:02:50.510 --> 01:02:52.230
for us to kinda come together,

01:02:52.230 --> 01:02:54.010
or rather technology has allowed us

01:02:54.010 --> 01:02:55.370
to avoid having to come together.

01:02:55.370 --> 01:02:56.390
I guess that's the better way to put it.

01:02:56.390 --> 01:02:57.750
I mean there are opportunities
to come together,

01:02:57.750 --> 01:03:00.320
but it's easier not to do that.

01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:03.600
And I think it leads to the
type of polarization we see.

01:03:03.600 --> 01:03:04.800
We see it in small groups,

01:03:04.800 --> 01:03:08.430
and that's what I was able
to show in the study I did,

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:12.160
this whole phenomenon of
small group polarization

01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:14.190
based on all these mechanism
that we talked about,

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:16.860
like selectively forgetting
and then remembering,

01:03:16.860 --> 01:03:17.693
and "Oh, that's right.

01:03:17.693 --> 01:03:20.367
"Well, now I'm gonna
be even more staunched

01:03:20.367 --> 01:03:21.717
"in this particular idea."

01:03:24.810 --> 01:03:27.430
I think it really is about

01:03:27.430 --> 01:03:31.550
finding ways to make our
communities more inclusive

01:03:31.550 --> 01:03:33.540
and bringing more people into the tent

01:03:33.540 --> 01:03:37.610
and having conversations
that cross the boundaries

01:03:37.610 --> 01:03:40.580
that social media has allowed us

01:03:41.645 --> 01:03:45.720
to erect in very regular
and patterned ways.

01:03:47.790 --> 01:03:51.320
- [Audience Member] Thank you.

01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:53.220
- There are a couple
ways I think about this,

01:03:53.220 --> 01:03:55.400
and part of the way I'm framing it is,

01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:57.870
again, to come back in
my discipline in a way,

01:03:57.870 --> 01:04:01.050
which is that...

01:04:01.050 --> 01:04:04.920
Two things, one is I think I'm aware that

01:04:04.920 --> 01:04:09.680
fear really changes the
way we process information

01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:14.520
has incredibly profound impact on how we

01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:19.280
perceive things and
how we remember things.

01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:20.980
And so I think that there's a need

01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:23.970
to really be very
cognizant of how much fear

01:04:23.970 --> 01:04:26.853
is driving the information
that's coming in.

01:04:27.860 --> 01:04:29.990
And then the other part is that

01:04:29.990 --> 01:04:32.830
I think there's a real need to recognize

01:04:32.830 --> 01:04:36.040
when I was talking about how
early childhood experience

01:04:37.074 --> 01:04:39.783
is this critical period
for shaping the brain.

01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:43.060
There are really profound studies

01:04:43.060 --> 01:04:46.150
that show, for example,
that learning languages

01:04:46.150 --> 01:04:48.840
when you're very young,
in the first year of life,

01:04:48.840 --> 01:04:50.040
you're not learning the language,

01:04:50.040 --> 01:04:52.113
but you're hearing, for example,

01:04:53.540 --> 01:04:55.893
a language that has different tones.

01:04:57.580 --> 01:05:00.350
If you don't hear that in
your first year of life,

01:05:00.350 --> 01:05:04.160
you can't even those
distinctions later in your life.

01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:07.390
So it really shapes the
way you perceive the world.

01:05:07.390 --> 01:05:10.443
And I think that there's
a reality to that,

01:05:11.360 --> 01:05:14.740
to recognize that our brains
have been wired in a way

01:05:14.740 --> 01:05:18.480
that we see things through the lens

01:05:20.153 --> 01:05:22.040
of the people we've been around.

01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:24.340
That to me is a little bit liberating

01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:27.970
in the sense that if that were recognized,

01:05:27.970 --> 01:05:32.487
there might be more of
a openness to saying,

01:05:32.487 --> 01:05:36.160
"I'm seeing things
incredibly subjectively."

01:05:38.290 --> 01:05:39.320
And to go back to you,

01:05:39.320 --> 01:05:41.610
we're talking about zen traditions.

01:05:41.610 --> 01:05:45.193
There's this tradition of
zen mind, beginner's mind.

01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:49.090
If your mind is always
being changed by experience,

01:05:49.090 --> 01:05:50.840
there's no really beginner's mind,

01:05:50.840 --> 01:05:53.740
but you can at least
try to get towards that

01:05:53.740 --> 01:05:56.190
where you recognize that your experience

01:05:56.190 --> 01:05:58.833
are really shaping how
you perceive the world.

01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:03.350
- Just to go one step, next step,

01:06:03.350 --> 01:06:07.720
which is of course that
emptiness, that beginner's mind,

01:06:07.720 --> 01:06:12.680
that understanding that
everything is empty actually.

01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:15.470
And emptying it of all the associations,

01:06:15.470 --> 01:06:18.350
all the meanings, and really beginning

01:06:19.730 --> 01:06:21.340
to try and find

01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.090
the place at which things are empty

01:06:24.230 --> 01:06:27.260
is very, very, very powerful thing to do.

01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.990
And a simple thing, for example,

01:06:29.990 --> 01:06:31.593
just working in theater,

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
is, for me, whenever I'm
putting something on stage,

01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:40.293
I have to make sure the actor
is playing the opposite.

01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:43.950
In Japanese Noh drama,

01:06:43.950 --> 01:06:48.123
it says if you're going to
be an angry person on stage,

01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:51.070
you have to be very quiet,

01:06:51.070 --> 01:06:53.843
and very balanced, and
very self-possessed.

01:06:54.750 --> 01:06:55.860
It would be incorrect

01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:57.913
to show an angry person out of control.

01:07:01.104 --> 01:07:04.530
You always have to put
a little of the opposite

01:07:04.530 --> 01:07:06.710
to make sure the truth is there.

01:07:06.710 --> 01:07:08.110
And that's one of the things as art,

01:07:08.110 --> 01:07:08.943
we're always dealing

01:07:08.943 --> 01:07:10.560
with the difference
between art and propaganda.

01:07:10.560 --> 01:07:12.890
Propaganda is trying to
convince you of something,

01:07:12.890 --> 01:07:15.720
and therefore it's telling
one side of the story.

01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:19.980
So, what we always want to do
on stage is the shy person,

01:07:19.980 --> 01:07:23.310
if you have an actor
act like a little mouse,

01:07:23.310 --> 01:07:25.030
it's ridiculous.

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:28.500
The shy person is probably the
loudest person in the room.

01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.630
And so you always have a dramatic choice

01:07:30.630 --> 01:07:33.240
that's the opposite of the obvious choice,

01:07:33.240 --> 01:07:35.470
and you make sure that
you're balancing everything

01:07:35.470 --> 01:07:36.680
with its opposite,

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:39.993
because everything has to
contain its opposite to be true.

01:07:41.440 --> 01:07:44.890
And that begins to create
some sense of balance,

01:07:44.890 --> 01:07:46.940
some sense of equilibrium.

01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:49.460
And for the actor, it gives them something

01:07:49.460 --> 01:07:51.830
or her something to play against

01:07:51.830 --> 01:07:53.580
that actually creates a depth,

01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:57.390
and creates a complexity
of emotional experience.

01:07:57.390 --> 01:08:00.610
And you're never doing a one for one

01:08:00.610 --> 01:08:02.340
obvious correlation,

01:08:02.340 --> 01:08:04.640
but you make everybody have to go

01:08:04.640 --> 01:08:05.980
through the opposite of what it is

01:08:05.980 --> 01:08:08.220
they're supposedly expressing.

01:08:08.220 --> 01:08:11.620
And that creates something
like the complexity

01:08:11.620 --> 01:08:12.770
of human consciousness.

01:08:19.370 --> 01:08:20.720
- All the way up on the right side there,

01:08:20.720 --> 01:08:21.853
I see a hand up.

01:08:25.130 --> 01:08:27.810
- I'm wondering if certain issues

01:08:27.810 --> 01:08:30.670
that we're facing in terms
of memory and attention

01:08:30.670 --> 01:08:34.170
are helping to increase our sense of

01:08:34.170 --> 01:08:36.860
tribalism and also our

01:08:38.030 --> 01:08:39.620
sense of...

01:08:41.798 --> 01:08:42.990
How would I say this?

01:08:42.990 --> 01:08:46.490
Very easily instigated outrage.

01:08:46.490 --> 01:08:48.880
For instance, some of my professors,

01:08:48.880 --> 01:08:52.320
when I was here as a student
in the English lit department

01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:53.630
spoke of people

01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:59.773
reciting Homer's entire works from memory.

01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:04.140
When I was growing up, pre-digital age,

01:09:04.140 --> 01:09:07.280
I had 100 phone numbers in my head.

01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:09.520
Now I can barely remember
my own phone number

01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:10.620
to give out to people.

01:09:11.770 --> 01:09:14.480
Also, there's a lot of issue
with the tension I think.

01:09:14.480 --> 01:09:16.640
There's a lot of, correct me if I'm wrong,

01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.450
a lot of neuro biological
studies out right now

01:09:19.450 --> 01:09:22.010
that attention is rapidly changing.

01:09:22.010 --> 01:09:24.560
People's attention
spans are quite shorter.

01:09:24.560 --> 01:09:26.693
I'm wondering if these two issues,

01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:31.330
memory which we're relying on
our devices for all the time,

01:09:31.330 --> 01:09:33.490
why remember anything
when you can look it up,

01:09:33.490 --> 01:09:35.620
and also diminished attention

01:09:35.620 --> 01:09:39.553
are contributing to these other
issues we're talking about.

01:09:45.560 --> 01:09:46.810
- I would agree with that,

01:09:46.810 --> 01:09:49.290
and I think part of the issues is that

01:09:49.290 --> 01:09:52.390
those technologies are evolving

01:09:52.390 --> 01:09:55.200
a lot more quickly than
our brains are evolving.

01:09:55.200 --> 01:09:56.523
And I think that,

01:10:00.070 --> 01:10:01.143
a couple things,

01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:04.820
it's important to realize that we don't,

01:10:04.820 --> 01:10:06.850
our brain, when we perceive things,

01:10:06.850 --> 01:10:09.360
we actually are making
up half of what we see.

01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:10.850
If you figure out what

01:10:10.850 --> 01:10:13.300
is coming into your retina
and what you're looking at,

01:10:13.300 --> 01:10:14.990
we're making up half of it,

01:10:14.990 --> 01:10:17.550
but there's so much
stuff coming in right now

01:10:17.550 --> 01:10:19.440
that I do think it is...

01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:23.630
Maybe there just isn't the time to really

01:10:23.630 --> 01:10:27.393
put everything together in a
way that's very thoughtful.

01:10:28.510 --> 01:10:33.510
I remember my daughter
in high school took a

01:10:33.740 --> 01:10:34.840
poetry class,

01:10:34.840 --> 01:10:37.553
and the English teacher, when I asked him,

01:10:38.470 --> 01:10:41.820
why having a whole
semester just on poetry.

01:10:41.820 --> 01:10:42.930
I was delighted,

01:10:42.930 --> 01:10:45.560
but he was very explicit about it,

01:10:45.560 --> 01:10:46.760
and he said it's because

01:10:47.721 --> 01:10:51.740
it's so important if
you're 15, 16 years old

01:10:51.740 --> 01:10:55.063
to have to take time to read a poem,

01:10:56.280 --> 01:10:57.920
really read a poem carefully

01:10:57.920 --> 01:10:59.830
and spend your time reading the poem.

01:10:59.830 --> 01:11:04.830
And it made me realize
how rarely that happens.

01:11:06.610 --> 01:11:07.820
I grew up with that,

01:11:07.820 --> 01:11:12.820
but I certainly feel that
my children, my students,

01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:15.240
they don't have as much time.

01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:17.730
And at the medical school,
I can tell you that

01:11:17.730 --> 01:11:21.650
as a physician, you are now,

01:11:21.650 --> 01:11:23.490
when you see a patient,

01:11:23.490 --> 01:11:25.910
you look at the patient and
you talk to the patient,

01:11:25.910 --> 01:11:28.210
but you are with the monitor

01:11:28.210 --> 01:11:31.113
that tells you their
entire medical history,

01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.930
and some cases their entire imaging data,

01:11:34.930 --> 01:11:37.443
their lab data, their genomic data.

01:11:38.691 --> 01:11:42.230
So I think how we learn how to
process all that information,

01:11:42.230 --> 01:11:44.180
and whether that leads to divisiveness,

01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:48.403
it certain leads to kind of
a sense of being overwhelmed.

01:11:50.941 --> 01:11:53.140
- I think that people

01:11:54.800 --> 01:11:57.760
in the midst of being confronted
with all this information,

01:11:57.760 --> 01:12:00.330
they have to find ways
to quickly organize it,

01:12:00.330 --> 01:12:05.330
which allows us to, rather
prompts us to rely upon

01:12:06.850 --> 01:12:09.480
representations, the concept
that I mentioned earlier,

01:12:09.480 --> 01:12:11.850
which get into these types of divisions

01:12:11.850 --> 01:12:13.850
and constructions and categorizations

01:12:14.890 --> 01:12:16.100
of people and groups

01:12:16.100 --> 01:12:18.800
and the familiar versus
what's not familiar.

01:12:18.800 --> 01:12:20.450
And so, I can see how

01:12:22.030 --> 01:12:23.090
we're trying to play catch up

01:12:23.090 --> 01:12:24.380
in terms of our own development

01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:26.330
in keeping up with these
new technologies that

01:12:26.330 --> 01:12:30.010
we could revert back to some of these more

01:12:30.010 --> 01:12:31.110
comfortable tendencies.

01:12:31.110 --> 01:12:34.084
They, in the long run, I
think are very dangerous.

01:12:34.084 --> 01:12:36.350
- And I think spending time with the texts

01:12:36.350 --> 01:12:38.300
is also like spending time with people.

01:12:40.250 --> 01:12:44.030
What it means in the
history of spirituality

01:12:44.030 --> 01:12:47.523
that most of these texts,
the Bible, the Quran,

01:12:49.020 --> 01:12:52.970
the Buddhist sutras
were never written down

01:12:52.970 --> 01:12:54.780
for several centuries,

01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:57.200
and people learn them by heart.

01:12:57.200 --> 01:13:00.220
And what it is right now
if you're a Tibetan monk

01:13:00.220 --> 01:13:02.820
is you don't have a pile of books.

01:13:02.820 --> 01:13:07.260
You actually have memorized
every one of these texts,

01:13:07.260 --> 01:13:10.070
and what it means to
know something by heart,

01:13:10.070 --> 01:13:12.970
what it means to have
gone through this text

01:13:12.970 --> 01:13:17.970
700 times in one day until you begin to,

01:13:17.970 --> 01:13:20.890
new meanings begin to reveal themselves,

01:13:20.890 --> 01:13:23.420
when it's also one rather
than looking at somebody

01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:26.320
and guessing who they are in one second,

01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:29.230
what it means to spend
quality time with someone

01:13:29.230 --> 01:13:32.580
and learn that all the things
you thought someone was,

01:13:32.580 --> 01:13:34.180
of course they're none of those things,

01:13:34.180 --> 01:13:36.020
which is not just occasionally,

01:13:36.020 --> 01:13:38.720
that's all with everyone you meet.

01:13:38.720 --> 01:13:41.223
You're wrong about almost everything.

01:13:42.130 --> 01:13:44.853
And until you actually
spend time with someone,

01:13:46.070 --> 01:13:47.317
for one thing, they're trying to convince

01:13:47.317 --> 01:13:50.120
you of something that they're not as well.

01:13:50.120 --> 01:13:51.813
I'm not blaming one side.

01:13:53.070 --> 01:13:54.830
But what it takes to spend time

01:13:54.830 --> 01:13:57.550
to get to know who
someone really is behind

01:13:57.550 --> 01:13:59.100
what all those appearances are.

01:14:00.260 --> 01:14:05.090
That's just time, investment
of time and attention.

01:14:05.090 --> 01:14:06.930
And that quality of attention

01:14:06.930 --> 01:14:08.506
can move to how they're dressed

01:14:08.506 --> 01:14:10.790
and the Sherlock Holmes thing

01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.560
to a deeper place,

01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:17.600
which is actually the Sufi place

01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:21.010
where you're able to look and listen

01:14:22.090 --> 01:14:24.810
because you're self-focused very deeply.

01:14:24.810 --> 01:14:28.510
One Sufi master who I toured with for

01:14:28.510 --> 01:14:29.760
several years of my life,

01:14:29.760 --> 01:14:31.923
a great Nubian oud player.

01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:35.190
We would be in some crowded restaurant

01:14:35.190 --> 01:14:37.130
in Los Angeles or Berlin,

01:14:37.130 --> 01:14:40.180
and he point to a table on
the other side of the room.

01:14:40.180 --> 01:14:42.317
And he'd say "Okay, Peter,
what are they saying?"

01:14:43.420 --> 01:14:45.447
I would say, "Hamza, this
restaurant is so loud.

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:47.190
"Everything is so crazy."

01:14:47.190 --> 01:14:48.897
And he said, "You don't listen.

01:14:49.817 --> 01:14:51.837
"You don't know how to listen.

01:14:51.837 --> 01:14:56.740
"Focus on that table and
tell me what they're saying."

01:14:56.740 --> 01:14:58.632
- [Kelsey] That's
eavesdropping, I'm sorry.

01:14:58.632 --> 01:15:00.154
(laughs)

01:15:00.154 --> 01:15:02.670
- Yeah, no, but it's also,

01:15:02.670 --> 01:15:05.320
in the Sufi thing, it's about healing.

01:15:05.320 --> 01:15:06.660
It's about actually

01:15:06.660 --> 01:15:09.400
knowing most human beings
are trying to prevent you

01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:11.560
from understanding who they are,

01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.670
and you have to reach inside

01:15:13.670 --> 01:15:15.800
and be able to look in someone's eyes

01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:18.150
and see everything that's
ever happened to them

01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:21.130
in a way that maybe they themselves

01:15:21.130 --> 01:15:24.290
don't even acknowledge or understand.

01:15:24.290 --> 01:15:26.940
And so, some of that level of perception,

01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:29.480
anyway, thank you for this remark,

01:15:29.480 --> 01:15:31.920
because it really is about a time,

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.670
but of course time by
itself isn't anything

01:15:33.670 --> 01:15:37.173
because you can waste 10
years or use five minutes.

01:15:38.440 --> 01:15:40.710
It's the quality of attention

01:15:40.710 --> 01:15:43.320
that's happening within that time.

01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:45.420
And again, that's one of the reasons

01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:46.630
theater was invented

01:15:46.630 --> 01:15:48.640
and portrait painting was invented,

01:15:48.640 --> 01:15:51.240
was so you would spend the
time to look at someone,

01:15:51.240 --> 01:15:52.720
not just to glance,

01:15:52.720 --> 01:15:54.360
but actually look deeply.

01:15:54.360 --> 01:15:56.400
And that Rembrandt would go

01:15:56.400 --> 01:16:00.650
and sit with some old lady
up stairs in the slums

01:16:00.650 --> 01:16:02.350
who no one would pay attention to

01:16:02.350 --> 01:16:04.900
and Rembrandt spends two weeks with her,

01:16:04.900 --> 01:16:06.760
and looks deeply into her eyes

01:16:06.760 --> 01:16:09.350
and paints her left sleeve,

01:16:09.350 --> 01:16:11.997
and then writes on the bottom,

01:16:11.997 --> 01:16:14.307
"The biblical prophet is Esther."

01:16:15.730 --> 01:16:18.090
And sees in some old lady in the slum,

01:16:18.090 --> 01:16:19.293
a biblical prophetess.

01:16:20.320 --> 01:16:22.240
And that quality of looking

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:25.100
is really what we're
talking about as artist

01:16:25.100 --> 01:16:27.980
is looking past the surface

01:16:27.980 --> 01:16:29.923
into the layers of the lives.

01:16:31.720 --> 01:16:33.880
- Back down to the front of the room,

01:16:33.880 --> 01:16:34.940
just so that we can move it around.

01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:35.920
Yes, right there.

01:16:35.920 --> 01:16:36.753
- Hi.

01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.190
I've always been curious
about the correlation between

01:16:42.190 --> 01:16:44.460
memory and dreams,

01:16:44.460 --> 01:16:47.090
and the art of dreaming

01:16:47.090 --> 01:16:48.990
has always been very intriguing to me.

01:16:50.210 --> 01:16:53.520
What do you think shapes our dreams?

01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:54.980
Could it be our past memories

01:16:54.980 --> 01:16:58.040
telling us a story as you said?

01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:02.550
Could it possibly be
warnings for the future?

01:17:02.550 --> 01:17:05.160
Or is it something that we will simply

01:17:05.160 --> 01:17:06.873
never be able to understand?

01:17:08.853 --> 01:17:10.680
- That's great.

01:17:10.680 --> 01:17:12.340
- Well, I know what I--

01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:14.184
(all laughs)

01:17:14.184 --> 01:17:15.490
- I can be wrong.

01:17:15.490 --> 01:17:18.512
- Okay, science, please,
come to our rescue.

01:17:18.512 --> 01:17:19.667
- No, no, no, no, no.

01:17:19.667 --> 01:17:21.320
(all laughs)

01:17:21.320 --> 01:17:23.760
I mean there is this part that there's

01:17:23.760 --> 01:17:25.080
memory that you get,

01:17:25.080 --> 01:17:27.030
you replay a lot of different things

01:17:27.030 --> 01:17:28.110
and you put them together

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.493
in all sorts of different
ways in your memory.

01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.220
And at least in studies we can look at

01:17:37.220 --> 01:17:42.220
animals that have lived in
an enriched environment,

01:17:42.570 --> 01:17:46.240
and you can look at how
their brains are firing,

01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.020
and you watch them navigate through a maze

01:17:49.020 --> 01:17:51.040
and you see all the parts of the circuits

01:17:51.040 --> 01:17:52.560
in their brain that are active.

01:17:52.560 --> 01:17:53.740
And then while they're asleep,

01:17:53.740 --> 01:17:56.410
you see the whole thing replayed again.

01:17:56.410 --> 01:17:58.870
So that may not be all that there is,

01:17:58.870 --> 01:18:00.770
but it kinda tells me

01:18:02.570 --> 01:18:03.920
that's not how I look in my own memories,

01:18:03.920 --> 01:18:05.100
so I look at them,

01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:06.100
I mean my own dreams,

01:18:06.100 --> 01:18:09.250
I look at them and I go
boy, what did that mean.

01:18:09.250 --> 01:18:10.970
But I also do think,

01:18:10.970 --> 01:18:13.910
well, there must've been
something that went on that I did,

01:18:13.910 --> 01:18:15.250
wasn't really paying attention to,

01:18:15.250 --> 01:18:16.230
but I knew was there,

01:18:16.230 --> 01:18:18.670
and I'm replaying it somehow,

01:18:18.670 --> 01:18:20.553
making it to a different story.

01:18:21.790 --> 01:18:23.490
- Yeah, I don't know what dreams mean.

01:18:23.490 --> 01:18:25.640
I certainly don't know
what my dreams mean.

01:18:27.220 --> 01:18:29.120
The point that I was trying to make

01:18:29.120 --> 01:18:30.500
with that particular quote,

01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:32.020
and it was a book that
really talked about,

01:18:32.020 --> 01:18:34.080
a lot of it was based on neuroscience,

01:18:34.080 --> 01:18:35.850
i mean the person who wrote the book.

01:18:35.850 --> 01:18:37.070
And I've kinda used the book,

01:18:37.070 --> 01:18:38.410
and it's been used in this way before

01:18:38.410 --> 01:18:40.400
to talk about the
importance of story telling

01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:42.940
and how important it
is to tell our stories

01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.740
and what our stories mean.

01:18:44.740 --> 01:18:46.770
And it was really the
form that dreams take.

01:18:46.770 --> 01:18:48.640
I mean dreams take the form of stories.

01:18:48.640 --> 01:18:51.010
I guess that's one way
of thinking about it,

01:18:51.010 --> 01:18:53.100
regardless of whether
or not those stories are

01:18:53.100 --> 01:18:56.860
reenactments of the past or
premonitions of the future

01:18:56.860 --> 01:18:59.750
or some weird mishmash of the two.

01:18:59.750 --> 01:19:01.530
It's really the story that key,

01:19:01.530 --> 01:19:03.180
and that memory is sort of

01:19:04.480 --> 01:19:07.060
told to stories basically.

01:19:07.060 --> 01:19:10.410
I mean history, his story, her story.

01:19:10.410 --> 01:19:11.440
We're talking about stories.

01:19:11.440 --> 01:19:13.600
- And also genuinely

01:19:13.600 --> 01:19:17.080
that we're not just
forever in the damn past.

01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.720
What it means to create a future

01:19:19.720 --> 01:19:23.227
is to actually be able
to say, "I have a dream."

01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:30.283
That is an incredibly powerful
place to move forward from,

01:19:31.150 --> 01:19:34.590
and we all need every day to move forward.

01:19:34.590 --> 01:19:36.730
Yes, we're dragging all this stuff,

01:19:36.730 --> 01:19:38.280
but there's gotta be some stuff

01:19:38.280 --> 01:19:41.560
that hasn't been done, hasn't been seen,

01:19:41.560 --> 01:19:43.930
is not already lived,

01:19:43.930 --> 01:19:45.760
and that's why we're on earth

01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:48.913
because some stuff hasn't happened yet.

01:19:53.390 --> 01:19:54.556
- Wonderful.

01:19:54.556 --> 01:19:56.710
There were questions all the
way up in the back there.

01:19:56.710 --> 01:19:58.060
Yes, right in the middle.

01:19:58.060 --> 01:20:00.460
If we can get a microphone up there,

01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:01.473
do we have one?

01:20:02.610 --> 01:20:03.443
Sorry, right here?

01:20:03.443 --> 01:20:04.680
Should we do this?

01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:05.610
Perfect.

01:20:05.610 --> 01:20:07.750
- I wonder if you people could speak to

01:20:07.750 --> 01:20:11.930
what happens with traumatic situations

01:20:11.930 --> 01:20:13.640
that are in our memory

01:20:13.640 --> 01:20:15.903
when they're dealt with psychedelics.

01:20:20.535 --> 01:20:22.180
- You mean the...

01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.930
So there was a traumatic experience

01:20:23.930 --> 01:20:25.970
and then there's psychedelics,

01:20:25.970 --> 01:20:28.650
or traumatic experience
during psychedelic use?

01:20:28.650 --> 01:20:29.973
- [Audience Member] No, no, no.

01:20:32.721 --> 01:20:34.080
All of the therapeutic things

01:20:34.080 --> 01:20:35.310
that are being done now,

01:20:35.310 --> 01:20:37.970
they're being reinstated now where

01:20:37.970 --> 01:20:40.740
they're actually treating people

01:20:40.740 --> 01:20:44.890
to overcome their debilitating
effects of trauma.

01:20:44.890 --> 01:20:46.450
So what's going on?

01:20:46.450 --> 01:20:49.263
That's a memory that gets changed?

01:20:51.471 --> 01:20:54.620
- I do believe that it's a way of

01:20:54.620 --> 01:20:56.470
opening the doors of perception,

01:20:56.470 --> 01:20:58.750
that it's a way of
increasing that plasticity

01:20:58.750 --> 01:21:00.980
in your brain so that you realize that

01:21:00.980 --> 01:21:04.520
if you have a traumatic
experience that has

01:21:05.490 --> 01:21:09.030
led to a very strong sort of wiring,

01:21:09.030 --> 01:21:11.030
so that everything reminds you,

01:21:11.030 --> 01:21:12.580
any little thing reminds you

01:21:12.580 --> 01:21:15.810
of that traumatic experience of

01:21:15.810 --> 01:21:20.100
psychedelics will help
rewire your brain in a way,

01:21:20.100 --> 01:21:21.880
and they will allow you to see

01:21:21.880 --> 01:21:24.410
things in a slightly different way.

01:21:24.410 --> 01:21:25.750
Again, I'm telling you that,

01:21:25.750 --> 01:21:29.510
But there's no honest
evidence that that happens,

01:21:29.510 --> 01:21:31.860
except that it does allow individuals

01:21:33.914 --> 01:21:38.914
to experience their past
experiences in a different way.

01:21:41.610 --> 01:21:44.710
- And maybe if I could just also add that,

01:21:44.710 --> 01:21:48.560
again, we just keep pathologizing trauma,

01:21:48.560 --> 01:21:50.910
and not getting that
trauma is also the key

01:21:50.910 --> 01:21:52.350
to your breakthrough,

01:21:52.350 --> 01:21:53.740
the key to the breakthrough

01:21:53.740 --> 01:21:55.470
the plan to come out of trauma.

01:21:55.470 --> 01:21:58.110
And the deepest, deepest
and most creative things

01:21:58.110 --> 01:22:00.930
come out of trauma and deep trauma.

01:22:00.930 --> 01:22:02.910
And I don't wanna just keep insisting

01:22:02.910 --> 01:22:04.290
that trauma is a disaster,

01:22:04.290 --> 01:22:09.230
and must be eliminated
surgically, but the opposite,

01:22:09.230 --> 01:22:13.270
is please go into the trauma and open it,

01:22:13.270 --> 01:22:15.870
and open it into a creative space.

01:22:15.870 --> 01:22:17.880
Open into a deeply creative space

01:22:17.880 --> 01:22:20.350
because you're not the only
person carrying trauma.

01:22:20.350 --> 01:22:24.690
And actually, everybody needs
to be able to deal with that.

01:22:24.690 --> 01:22:28.120
And so, any possible
creativity emerging from that

01:22:28.120 --> 01:22:28.970
is very powerful.

01:22:28.970 --> 01:22:30.840
And I would just say one
of the greatest things

01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:32.520
about living in the
United States of American,

01:22:32.520 --> 01:22:35.240
it became the greatest
country in the world

01:22:35.240 --> 01:22:37.740
because it was mad by a
lot of traumatized people.

01:22:38.840 --> 01:22:42.270
And the need to have a better idea,

01:22:42.270 --> 01:22:43.870
and the need to overcome,

01:22:43.870 --> 01:22:45.640
and the need to rise above,

01:22:45.640 --> 01:22:48.050
and the need to move forward and press on

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:52.183
came from people escaping
holocaust or enduring them here.

01:22:53.404 --> 01:22:55.454
And that's the greatness of this country.

01:22:57.850 --> 01:22:58.720
- Right up there.

01:22:58.720 --> 01:23:00.123
In the back row right here.

01:23:01.990 --> 01:23:02.900
- [Audience Member] I'll just shout.

01:23:02.900 --> 01:23:03.763
- Okay.

01:23:06.344 --> 01:23:07.243
- It's so near.

01:23:11.410 --> 01:23:12.243
- Thank you.

01:23:12.243 --> 01:23:17.243
I'm curious about the
influence or the effect

01:23:17.560 --> 01:23:21.090
of our senses on our memories.

01:23:21.090 --> 01:23:23.280
I notice for example that sometimes

01:23:24.599 --> 01:23:27.590
a smell can take you right back

01:23:27.590 --> 01:23:31.720
to another place in your
life or another time,

01:23:31.720 --> 01:23:34.120
and I assume that memory

01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.570
is partially related to things that we see

01:23:37.570 --> 01:23:41.950
or things that we hear or taste.

01:23:41.950 --> 01:23:45.120
And I was curious if anybody had any

01:23:45.120 --> 01:23:48.390
thoughts a the role that our senses,

01:23:48.390 --> 01:23:52.310
as opposed to where we stand in society,

01:23:52.310 --> 01:23:55.870
what gender we are, what race we are,

01:23:55.870 --> 01:24:00.007
how memory is affected by our senses.

01:24:01.960 --> 01:24:03.570
- I opened up by talking about

01:24:03.570 --> 01:24:06.000
conventional social scientific ways

01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:07.410
of thinking about memory,

01:24:07.410 --> 01:24:11.020
and sensory memory was the
very first one I had listed.

01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.810
I think I gave the example of sight

01:24:12.810 --> 01:24:15.160
and the way that if
you're looking at a movie,

01:24:15.160 --> 01:24:17.830
you remember each frame,

01:24:17.830 --> 01:24:19.020
ad you see this fluid motion

01:24:19.020 --> 01:24:21.670
that in fact is actually
individual frames.

01:24:21.670 --> 01:24:23.020
And so, yeah, I mean the
point you made earlier

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:24.540
about smell about sounds,

01:24:24.540 --> 01:24:26.740
I mean all those things
can trigger memories

01:24:28.858 --> 01:24:30.990
and be quite deep seated.

01:24:30.990 --> 01:24:33.390
I mean you would know more
about the architecture

01:24:33.390 --> 01:24:35.210
of that in terms of how
it works in the brain,

01:24:35.210 --> 01:24:39.923
but certainly we do look at
those precursors to memories.

01:24:40.780 --> 01:24:42.300
- I mean smell and taste

01:24:42.300 --> 01:24:45.463
have very profound effects on memory.

01:24:46.850 --> 01:24:49.320
And if any of you have
ever eaten something,

01:24:49.320 --> 01:24:51.460
and then gotten sick,

01:24:51.460 --> 01:24:54.390
that is one of the strongest ways

01:24:54.390 --> 01:24:55.460
of forming a memory

01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.450
that you never wanna eat that fruit again,

01:24:57.450 --> 01:24:59.047
or it takes an awful long time,

01:24:59.047 --> 01:25:03.200
and it gets back to that sort of very,

01:25:03.200 --> 01:25:04.220
I hate to use this word,

01:25:04.220 --> 01:25:08.840
but people talk about it as
a primitive form of memory,

01:25:08.840 --> 01:25:10.820
and it is.

01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.430
If you're a worm in the dirt

01:25:13.430 --> 01:25:16.160
and you eat something bitter
that makes you really sick,

01:25:16.160 --> 01:25:17.700
you're not gonna eat that again.

01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:21.700
And similar for smell, I
mean Proust, the madeleine,

01:25:21.700 --> 01:25:24.200
it brought back this incredible

01:25:27.110 --> 01:25:29.793
deep rich memory.

01:25:30.860 --> 01:25:32.410
I thought about it with the sound.

01:25:32.410 --> 01:25:36.020
The sounds that you were
talking about, the voices,

01:25:36.020 --> 01:25:38.000
and certainly music.

01:25:38.000 --> 01:25:40.070
Music, how many people?

01:25:40.070 --> 01:25:42.150
We were listening to songs about memory

01:25:42.150 --> 01:25:43.130
and making comments,

01:25:43.130 --> 01:25:45.740
but one of them really reminded
me of being in high school,

01:25:45.740 --> 01:25:49.020
and it makes me, brings
me back in a way that

01:25:50.620 --> 01:25:53.233
very little else will do that.

01:25:54.120 --> 01:25:55.810
- And I would just also emphasize

01:25:55.810 --> 01:25:57.500
that we are so taught to value

01:25:57.500 --> 01:26:00.100
the part of the world that
surrounds us made by men.

01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:01.773
And in fact,

01:26:03.240 --> 01:26:04.540
your grandmother's cooking

01:26:05.520 --> 01:26:07.320
shaped your life more than anything.

01:26:08.770 --> 01:26:10.290
It's actually those smells,

01:26:10.290 --> 01:26:11.780
it's actually those tastes

01:26:11.780 --> 01:26:14.610
that are the deepest, deepest
things shaping your life,

01:26:14.610 --> 01:26:16.330
because that's your grandmother

01:26:16.330 --> 01:26:18.380
and your mother shaping your life

01:26:18.380 --> 01:26:21.163
every single day during
those crucial years.

01:26:22.100 --> 01:26:25.050
And so, those smells and tastes

01:26:25.050 --> 01:26:26.780
go so deep,

01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:29.270
and go so deep into your earliest

01:26:29.270 --> 01:26:30.713
and most profound emotions.

01:26:32.680 --> 01:26:36.230
I would also just emphasize
the beauty of synesthesia,

01:26:36.230 --> 01:26:38.750
which is what we work
within the arts a lot,

01:26:38.750 --> 01:26:40.730
that there's the smell that

01:26:40.730 --> 01:26:42.330
you can associate with the sound,

01:26:42.330 --> 01:26:46.630
or a sound you associate
with a taste or a touch.

01:26:46.630 --> 01:26:48.370
We haven't talked that much about touch,

01:26:48.370 --> 01:26:50.310
but some of the artist that

01:26:51.190 --> 01:26:55.560
I work with work almost
exclusively with touch

01:26:55.560 --> 01:26:59.420
and the way in which your
memory is connected to touch

01:26:59.420 --> 01:27:00.373
is very powerful,

01:27:00.373 --> 01:27:02.800
and the way a certain type of touch

01:27:02.800 --> 01:27:04.990
will trigger all kinds of feelings,

01:27:04.990 --> 01:27:07.593
all kinds of memories,
all kinds of sensations.

01:27:09.898 --> 01:27:14.050
The thing that I love about
those is unlike sight,

01:27:14.050 --> 01:27:19.050
which has been organized by batteries of

01:27:19.340 --> 01:27:20.640
Republican's operatives

01:27:20.640 --> 01:27:23.460
who get up earlier than
you do by three hours.

01:27:23.460 --> 01:27:27.870
And we've categories a bunch of things,

01:27:27.870 --> 01:27:30.490
and we have labels on
them as you were saying.

01:27:30.490 --> 01:27:33.230
What's so beautiful about taste and smells

01:27:33.230 --> 01:27:35.130
is they're so hard to label.

01:27:35.130 --> 01:27:37.403
They're so hard to produce.

01:27:38.300 --> 01:27:39.440
Those are those kind of people,

01:27:39.440 --> 01:27:41.000
these are these kind of people.

01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:41.990
Those are the good people,

01:27:41.990 --> 01:27:43.290
these are the bad people.

01:27:43.290 --> 01:27:46.200
It's really hard to
organize taste that way.

01:27:46.200 --> 01:27:51.050
It's really difficult to
put those same kind of

01:27:51.050 --> 01:27:53.360
egregious value judgements,

01:27:53.360 --> 01:27:58.150
whereas we're so trained to

01:27:58.150 --> 01:28:00.720
parse the visual world that way

01:28:00.720 --> 01:28:03.120
and look at people a certain way.

01:28:03.120 --> 01:28:05.450
But in fact, once you get into the taste,

01:28:05.450 --> 01:28:07.650
it moves in a whole other directions

01:28:07.650 --> 01:28:09.500
that you're not in control of.

01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:12.980
So I'm very partial to
those particular senses.

01:28:12.980 --> 01:28:13.813
Thank you.

01:28:15.240 --> 01:28:17.403
- Hi, I have a question.

01:28:19.270 --> 01:28:21.990
I was wondering, you
guys have talked about

01:28:22.890 --> 01:28:27.890
riots, and anger, and PTSD, and trauma,

01:28:28.826 --> 01:28:29.659
and I was wondering.

01:28:29.659 --> 01:28:32.410
I'd love to hear you
guys elaborate more on

01:28:32.410 --> 01:28:34.530
the process of healing.

01:28:34.530 --> 01:28:37.680
How do we pause the knowledge

01:28:37.680 --> 01:28:40.283
but also heal and move forward?

01:28:45.222 --> 01:28:46.250
- I'm trying to think about that

01:28:46.250 --> 01:28:47.623
in the context of memory.

01:28:50.020 --> 01:28:53.510
Well, I mean, I think healing

01:28:55.640 --> 01:29:00.200
involves confronting trauma
on some very basic levels.

01:29:00.200 --> 01:29:02.800
I mean I think any psychoanalyst
will tell you that.

01:29:03.960 --> 01:29:08.390
Kind of engaging with the memories that

01:29:09.500 --> 01:29:12.280
kinda flow from the trauma

01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.750
allows you to bring it in the present

01:29:14.750 --> 01:29:17.440
and to analyze it in ways that

01:29:17.440 --> 01:29:19.660
subconsciously maybe you're not aware of,

01:29:19.660 --> 01:29:21.100
and allows you to kinda,

01:29:21.100 --> 01:29:23.200
again, it must have
some effect in the brain

01:29:23.200 --> 01:29:25.570
in terms of how you think about it

01:29:25.570 --> 01:29:26.803
from that point forward,

01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:32.173
and creates the condition
of possibility to kinda,

01:29:34.420 --> 01:29:36.021
it involves other groups

01:29:36.021 --> 01:29:38.230
to engage with those groups that

01:29:38.230 --> 01:29:40.343
may have been off limits in the past.

01:29:41.210 --> 01:29:42.900
So I think on some very basic level,

01:29:42.900 --> 01:29:44.070
you have to acknowledge

01:29:44.070 --> 01:29:46.070
whatever it was that created the trauma,

01:29:46.070 --> 01:29:49.760
and then bring it into the present,

01:29:49.760 --> 01:29:53.853
analyze it, and talk
about it, communicate.

01:29:54.900 --> 01:29:57.600
Share the stories that are
associated with the trauma.

01:29:58.797 --> 01:29:59.670
- I mean I agree.

01:29:59.670 --> 01:30:04.230
I think you have to attend to the trauma,

01:30:04.230 --> 01:30:06.100
and I do think that there's

01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:08.173
a really important part in,

01:30:11.800 --> 01:30:14.750
for therapy, that there's
another person there,

01:30:14.750 --> 01:30:16.890
that it's actually a social activity.

01:30:16.890 --> 01:30:18.833
It's not just on your own.

01:30:21.920 --> 01:30:24.060
Thinking about it, confronting it,

01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:25.380
but it's acknowledging,

01:30:25.380 --> 01:30:27.340
and I think that's part of story telling.

01:30:27.340 --> 01:30:29.270
It really is a way of being able

01:30:29.270 --> 01:30:30.850
to tell your story to somebody,

01:30:30.850 --> 01:30:34.140
your narrative and have it
understood in a way that's

01:30:35.320 --> 01:30:37.280
accepted as a human experience,

01:30:37.280 --> 01:30:39.320
but not as one that is

01:30:40.490 --> 01:30:42.470
sort of faithful in a way.

01:30:42.470 --> 01:30:46.483
That means that you're
constrained by that faith.

01:30:47.450 --> 01:30:48.590
There certainly are,

01:30:48.590 --> 01:30:50.590
for some things like PTSD,

01:30:50.590 --> 01:30:54.210
there are lots of very
biological approaches

01:30:54.210 --> 01:30:56.800
just trying to increase
the brain plasticity.

01:30:56.800 --> 01:30:58.570
There are a lot of people
who try to do things

01:30:58.570 --> 01:31:02.570
like exposure therapy for a phobia.

01:31:02.570 --> 01:31:05.020
And I would say there it's really

01:31:05.020 --> 01:31:07.610
part of the important thing
is that there's somebody else

01:31:07.610 --> 01:31:11.670
who's there, who's helping
you relive that experience,

01:31:11.670 --> 01:31:13.560
but relive it in a different way,

01:31:13.560 --> 01:31:17.470
because it's not dangerous,

01:31:17.470 --> 01:31:19.320
it's not threatening in the second,

01:31:19.320 --> 01:31:22.363
in the reliving of it.

01:31:23.580 --> 01:31:26.600
- Absolutely, and not to be alone

01:31:26.600 --> 01:31:27.940
is the most important thing,

01:31:27.940 --> 01:31:31.430
because your trauma is
all about being alone,

01:31:31.430 --> 01:31:34.090
and not being able to deal with yourself,

01:31:34.090 --> 01:31:35.490
not being proud of yourself,

01:31:35.490 --> 01:31:36.640
in fact, being ashamed,

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.460
and to realize you're not the only person

01:31:41.460 --> 01:31:42.800
who's going through this.

01:31:42.800 --> 01:31:45.160
So what this means that it's shared,

01:31:45.160 --> 01:31:46.150
that it's shared,

01:31:46.150 --> 01:31:49.687
and again, we're also sure
something is wrong with us

01:31:49.687 --> 01:31:53.080
and we're not dealing with
their systematic things going on

01:31:53.080 --> 01:31:55.150
that are affecting
large numbers of people.

01:31:55.150 --> 01:31:57.730
And when you begin to
realize you're not alone,

01:31:57.730 --> 01:31:59.820
its a very, very deep thing.

01:31:59.820 --> 01:32:02.500
I would just add on
behalf of the arts that

01:32:02.500 --> 01:32:05.320
officially the Canadian government

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:07.810
is now saying the only treatment

01:32:07.810 --> 01:32:10.750
that can actually be put
forward at the moment

01:32:12.320 --> 01:32:14.013
for PTSD is music.

01:32:15.190 --> 01:32:18.030
And music is being used
over and over again now

01:32:18.030 --> 01:32:22.010
for returning Canadian soldiers
from Afghanistan and Iraq,

01:32:22.010 --> 01:32:25.683
and it's being very,
very powerful results.

01:32:26.830 --> 01:32:30.003
And music has a way of both liberating,

01:32:30.840 --> 01:32:35.710
and relaxing, and opening,
and creating a spaciousness

01:32:35.710 --> 01:32:37.700
of thought and feelings.

01:32:37.700 --> 01:32:39.810
And at the same time, music can deal with

01:32:39.810 --> 01:32:43.216
very, very intense emotional states.

01:32:43.216 --> 01:32:48.140
And so music has had a
profound effect on soldiers

01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:50.733
returning from these last wars.

01:32:53.290 --> 01:32:55.950
- One last question from the audience.

01:32:55.950 --> 01:32:56.900
Do we have a microphone?

01:32:56.900 --> 01:32:57.747
Here we are.

01:32:58.930 --> 01:33:01.560
- You were mentioning longer,

01:33:01.560 --> 01:33:05.863
short-term memory and
long-term memory before.

01:33:07.080 --> 01:33:12.080
So, why when we are very old

01:33:12.172 --> 01:33:15.150
and near the end of our life,

01:33:15.150 --> 01:33:19.360
we remember only things a long time ago

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:24.360
and we kinda don't want,
deny things that are present?

01:33:24.610 --> 01:33:26.973
I don't know, you call
it short-term memory.

01:33:28.348 --> 01:33:29.993
It's only a long-term memory.

01:33:31.485 --> 01:33:34.610
It's very strange because
I'm thinking about the brain

01:33:34.610 --> 01:33:36.560
that is corroding, that is getting old,

01:33:37.800 --> 01:33:40.700
and actually you should
remember the last things

01:33:40.700 --> 01:33:45.700
you just did, not the things
before because it's gone.

01:33:47.670 --> 01:33:51.130
Instead, when you hear the last word

01:33:51.130 --> 01:33:52.853
of people that almost died,

01:33:54.120 --> 01:33:56.960
tell you things from the past,

01:33:56.960 --> 01:33:59.870
from when they were young.

01:33:59.870 --> 01:34:01.313
They remember the mother,

01:34:02.359 --> 01:34:05.660
they tell you story that are really back,

01:34:05.660 --> 01:34:07.180
and that strike me.

01:34:07.180 --> 01:34:10.420
I would like to know as a scientist

01:34:10.420 --> 01:34:11.920
what's happening to our brain.

01:34:13.354 --> 01:34:14.187
(laughs)

01:34:14.187 --> 01:34:15.570
- Well, I'm gonna,

01:34:15.570 --> 01:34:17.800
Kelsey, this is your area of specialty.

01:34:17.800 --> 01:34:20.230
Is it true that it's all in there,

01:34:20.230 --> 01:34:21.849
it's just a matter of how we access it?

01:34:21.849 --> 01:34:23.450
Is that what it really is?

01:34:23.450 --> 01:34:25.530
How do these things work?

01:34:25.530 --> 01:34:27.990
- Well, I mean--
(audience laughs)

01:34:27.990 --> 01:34:28.823
- It's a good last question.

01:34:28.823 --> 01:34:30.780
- I'll be perfectly honest that

01:34:30.780 --> 01:34:33.240
not only do I not know
how they really work,

01:34:33.240 --> 01:34:35.360
but nobody knows how they really work,

01:34:35.360 --> 01:34:39.800
but I can tell you what
some hypothesis are,

01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:43.617
which is that when I talked
about this brain plasticity

01:34:43.617 --> 01:34:46.363
and about the ability of
forming different synapses,

01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:52.400
that that's really good in young people.

01:34:52.670 --> 01:34:55.250
It's not so good as you get older.

01:34:55.250 --> 01:34:58.580
And so you really have
created these circuits

01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:00.290
that are pretty hardwired,

01:35:00.290 --> 01:35:04.910
and so you could remember
things from a long time ago,

01:35:04.910 --> 01:35:07.210
but it's harder to have that plasticity

01:35:07.210 --> 01:35:10.290
that's gonna encode new memories.

01:35:10.290 --> 01:35:12.243
That's one of the things that,

01:35:13.080 --> 01:35:18.080
to me, that is exactly what
I work on in my own lab,

01:35:18.760 --> 01:35:20.730
is trying to understand what

01:35:20.730 --> 01:35:22.920
at a molecular level is happening

01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.080
that allows us to go from a short-term

01:35:25.080 --> 01:35:26.097
to a long-term memory,

01:35:26.097 --> 01:35:28.860
and what's that kind of plasticity.

01:35:28.860 --> 01:35:32.510
Because it's both,

01:35:32.510 --> 01:35:34.160
there's that

01:35:34.160 --> 01:35:37.480
wonderful thing about
being a child that you can

01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.080
learn new languages,

01:35:39.080 --> 01:35:43.540
you can learn how to play the violin

01:35:43.540 --> 01:35:45.710
much more easily than when you're older,

01:35:45.710 --> 01:35:47.070
and there is that kind of

01:35:48.730 --> 01:35:52.140
a little bit of a shrinking
down of that plasticity.

01:35:52.140 --> 01:35:53.600
It's not all or none,

01:35:53.600 --> 01:35:55.990
and we see people all over who continue,

01:35:55.990 --> 01:35:57.360
and there are all these things

01:35:57.360 --> 01:35:58.450
that show that if you

01:36:00.370 --> 01:36:02.680
listen to music, if you dance,

01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:06.170
if you do crosswords, you read,

01:36:06.170 --> 01:36:07.660
that you keep that going.

01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:11.010
But I do think it's something
that happens with aging,

01:36:11.010 --> 01:36:13.373
you lose some of that brain plasticity.

01:36:14.290 --> 01:36:15.880
You have all the old-term memories

01:36:15.880 --> 01:36:17.030
because they're already stored.

01:36:17.030 --> 01:36:18.580
You just don't have that ability

01:36:18.580 --> 01:36:20.400
to like change the circuit.

01:36:22.158 --> 01:36:24.810
- And I think also the encounter,

01:36:24.810 --> 01:36:28.260
what we also remember is our
first encounter with something,

01:36:28.260 --> 01:36:30.740
or our first encounter with someone.

01:36:30.740 --> 01:36:33.020
And so it's when everything is new

01:36:33.020 --> 01:36:34.710
that we actually remember it.

01:36:34.710 --> 01:36:38.750
Our experience in
discovery is so profound.

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:40.460
And once you stop discovering,

01:36:40.460 --> 01:36:41.790
once something isn't knew,

01:36:41.790 --> 01:36:45.040
it's hard to create a new memory,

01:36:45.040 --> 01:36:47.270
because you're actually repeating what...

01:36:48.630 --> 01:36:49.690
Forgive me for saying this,

01:36:49.690 --> 01:36:54.230
but my mother who's really
forgetting a lot these days,

01:36:54.230 --> 01:36:57.113
is in a place where people
are helping to care for her.

01:36:58.780 --> 01:37:01.780
They have a trip in a bus

01:37:01.780 --> 01:37:05.770
in the afternoons to go out
to the beach in San Francisco,

01:37:05.770 --> 01:37:07.103
and see the Golden Gate.

01:37:08.540 --> 01:37:11.433
And my mother said to me two days ago,

01:37:12.307 --> 01:37:13.140
"I've seen the water.

01:37:13.140 --> 01:37:14.107
"I've seen the beach.

01:37:14.107 --> 01:37:15.957
"I don't need to see those things."

01:37:18.300 --> 01:37:20.490
And it's very intense because what is it

01:37:20.490 --> 01:37:23.593
when you tell yourself
it's not a new experience.

01:37:24.810 --> 01:37:28.343
You stop creating new experience.

01:37:32.070 --> 01:37:33.288
- Thank you.

01:37:33.288 --> 01:37:34.121
(applauding)

01:37:34.121 --> 01:37:35.550
Everybody, we're gonna
have to draw the evening

01:37:35.550 --> 01:37:37.426
to a close here.

01:37:37.426 --> 01:37:38.593
I don't think,

01:37:39.990 --> 01:37:42.040
I don't think it would be too self-aware

01:37:42.040 --> 01:37:43.630
to say for everybody in the room,

01:37:43.630 --> 01:37:46.357
thank you for an incredibly
memorable evening.

01:37:46.357 --> 01:37:47.620
(audience laughs)

01:37:47.620 --> 01:37:49.230
I think everyone in the audience,

01:37:49.230 --> 01:37:52.460
please, please, help me
thank our three guest

01:37:52.460 --> 01:37:55.400
for taking time out of
their very busy lives.

01:37:55.400 --> 01:37:58.050
UCLA's dean of the David
Geffen School of Medicine,

01:37:58.050 --> 01:37:59.310

01:37:59.310 --> 01:38:02.700
UCLA's dean for Division
of Social Sciences,

01:38:02.700 --> 01:38:06.380
world arts and cultures
professor, Peter Sellars.

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:09.410
And the memory of world arts cultures

01:38:09.410 --> 01:38:12.490
Professor Polly Nooter Roberts

01:38:12.490 --> 01:38:14.170
who is with us here also this evening.

01:38:14.170 --> 01:38:15.170
Thank you everybody.
