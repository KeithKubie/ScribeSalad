00:00:01.360 --> 00:00:04.210
SPEAKER 1: A large temple
engulfed by a fine white dust

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:07.746
cloud, colorfully dressed people
walking toward the entrance.

00:00:07.746 --> 00:00:09.120
You may have
already guessed this

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.540
is a picture from Burning
Man, and you may have already

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:13.280
started to roll your eyes.

00:00:13.280 --> 00:00:15.280
But no matter what your
ideas about the festival

00:00:15.280 --> 00:00:18.560
are, once you see these pictures
of the art, the structures,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.280
and the people,
you might actually

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:21.800
want to experience
it for yourself.

00:00:26.611 --> 00:00:28.360
SCOTT LONDON: Hi, my
name is Scott London.

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.890
I'm a journalist and a
photographer from California.

00:00:30.890 --> 00:00:33.560
This is a photo taken at Burning
Man, an annual gathering that

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:36.560
takes place every summer in the
Black Rock Desert of Nevada.

00:00:36.560 --> 00:00:39.460
This is the Temple of
Transition, a massive art

00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:42.000
installation at
Burning Man 2011.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580
At the time, the
temple was rumored

00:00:43.580 --> 00:00:45.790
to be the largest wooden
temporary installation

00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:48.352
in the world, of sprawling
dream-like structure made up

00:00:48.352 --> 00:00:50.930
of five small temples
and a center tower rising

00:00:50.930 --> 00:00:53.380
about 120 feet above
the desert floor.

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.855
SPEAKER 1: But don't let's
Scott's sincerity fool you.

00:00:55.855 --> 00:00:58.874
He also once rolled his eyes
at the thought of Burning Man.

00:00:58.874 --> 00:01:01.290
SCOTT LONDON: I had no interest
in going to the event when

00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:02.380
I first heard about it.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:03.870
I had seen images
of people doing

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:07.262
crazy things in the desert and
decided that it wasn't for me.

00:01:07.262 --> 00:01:09.220
If I ever make a trip to
the Black Rock Desert,

00:01:09.220 --> 00:01:10.803
I thought to myself,
it'll be to enjoy

00:01:10.803 --> 00:01:12.660
the beauty and the
serenity of the place,

00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:14.951
not to share it with tens of
thousands of other people.

00:01:14.951 --> 00:01:17.630
But after my girlfriend had
gone with some friends of hers,

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:21.381
she came home insisting that we
go together the following year.

00:01:21.381 --> 00:01:22.880
SPEAKER 1: Eventually,
Scott gave in

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:25.260
and traveled to the Nevada
desert with his girlfriend.

00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.080
And he never really looked back.

00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.120
He's returned to Burning Man
every year for the last twelve.

00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:32.120
SCOTT LONDON: Burning Man
means different things

00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:33.050
to different people.

00:01:33.050 --> 00:01:35.670
Some think of it as a
week-long party in the desert.

00:01:35.670 --> 00:01:37.720
Others see it as an
art festival where

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:39.920
installation artists
from around the world

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.680
come together to
exhibit their work.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.450
Still others describe it as
a kind of social experiment,

00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:46.130
where people go off
the grid for a week

00:01:46.130 --> 00:01:48.247
and create a temporary
community where

00:01:48.247 --> 00:01:50.455
many of the rules and
conventions of ordinary society

00:01:50.455 --> 00:01:51.440
are thrown out.

00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:52.940
Unlike a traditional
festival, where

00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.727
you go to be
entertained in some way

00:01:54.727 --> 00:01:57.060
and where there's a clear
boundary between the performer

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.010
and the spectator, Burning
Man is participant-driven.

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:02.790
Everybody contributes something
to the overall experience.

00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:03.820
And I love that.

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.770
I find that it's endlessly
fascinating to see

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:07.620
what people come up with.

00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:09.590
SPEAKER 1: And there
was only one way

00:02:09.590 --> 00:02:12.794
Scott could think of to capture
the creativity of the festival.

00:02:12.794 --> 00:02:14.460
SCOTT LONDON: I found
that it was simply

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:15.921
impossible to describe.

00:02:15.921 --> 00:02:18.420
And I realized that my best
hope of conveying the experience

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:19.770
would be through pictures.

00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:21.400
For me, what makes
Burning Man special

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:24.320
is that it's a kind of
laboratory for creativity.

00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:26.430
Everybody is encouraged
to express themselves

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:29.420
in some capacity, through making
art, playing music, walking

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.012
on stilts, fire dancing,
or simply being beautiful.

00:02:35.012 --> 00:02:36.720
SPEAKER 1: For more
"This Happened Here,"

00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:40.570
check out this episode on the
world's largest treehouse.

00:02:40.570 --> 00:02:42.720
SPEAKER 2: It's 97 feet
tall and is supported

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.481
by six different trees.

00:02:44.481 --> 00:02:46.980
The treehouse was well known
to those who lived in the area,

00:02:46.980 --> 00:02:49.432
and I'd been hearing
about it for some time.

00:02:49.432 --> 00:02:51.140
SPEAKER 1: And don't
forget to subscribe.

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:52.870
Thanks for watching.
