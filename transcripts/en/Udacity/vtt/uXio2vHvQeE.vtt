00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Now apply the trapezoidal rule to Dahlquist test equation.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
How large can we chose the step size and still have numerical

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
solution that approaches 0, x(t) goes to infinity.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Do we have to chose a step size that's less than 1/k, k being the constant of Dahlquist test equation,

00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:28.000
or a step size that's smaller than 2/k or a step size that's smaller than 1/kÂ²,

00:00:28.000 --> 99:59:59.000
or could we pick any positive value for the step size h.
