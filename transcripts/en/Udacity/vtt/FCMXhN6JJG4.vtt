[Peter] Since we want our Python code to print something,

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
we're going to start with the print statement.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000
And the answer would be 7 x 7 x 24.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
There are other ways to get at this, but I feel this is the most intuitive.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
The 7 corresponds to the number of weeks.

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The second 7 corresponds to the number of days we're calculating in each week,

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
and the 24 is the number of hours in each day.

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000
So let's run this in the Python interpreter to see what the result is.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
If we enter in the Python expression that we generated and click Run,

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
we get 1176, which is the correct answer.
