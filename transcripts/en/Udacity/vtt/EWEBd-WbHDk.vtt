00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
It turns out that the density of primes is such that

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.000
the number of primes below some number X

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
is proportional to X divided by the natural log of X.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
So this is log base E.

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
And I won't attempt to prove this.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
I'll resort to proof by intimidation.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
This was conjectured by Gauss and then Legendre

00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and proven later.

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
And that means that the probability--if we pick some random number,

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
the probability that that number is prime

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
is approximately 1 over the natural log of X.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
So the question is: how many guesses do we expect to need

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
to find a prime number that's around 100 decimal digits long?

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
And in computing this, you should assume that this probability

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
that a random X is prime is equal to 1 over the natural log of X

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.000
even though this is an approximation.
