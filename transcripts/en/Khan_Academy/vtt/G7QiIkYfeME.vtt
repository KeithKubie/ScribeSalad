00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.990
So I'm going to
write out a number

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.489
that we're going to think about
how we could say or actually

00:00:04.489 --> 00:00:05.830
write that number.

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:07.350
So I'm just going
to write it out.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:10.030
I'm going to resist the
temptation to actually speak it

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:11.780
out because that's
normally how I operate.

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:13.920
But I'm not going to
do that right now.

00:00:17.070 --> 00:00:19.480
So there's several ways
that we can pronounce.

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.050
So I encourage you to pause
it and try to pronounce it,

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:21.550
yourself.

00:00:21.550 --> 00:00:23.649
You might not even
need to pause it.

00:00:23.649 --> 00:00:25.190
Well, the first
thing that jumps out,

00:00:25.190 --> 00:00:27.990
well we've got
20,000 and then some.

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.050
So maybe we should
write it that way.

00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.315
So we've got 20,000.

00:00:33.315 --> 00:00:36.880
20-- actually let
me write it out

00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:39.520
as numbers first to
really decompose it.

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.460
So we have 20,000.

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:43.720
And then what do we
have on top of that?

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.300
Well we have 5/10.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:49.250
This is the tenths place.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:53.910
So we can literally
write that as 5/10.

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.200
5/10.

00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.606
Then we have 0, 0/100.

00:00:59.606 --> 00:01:01.480
I'll write that as a
hundredths place just so

00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:03.170
that we can keep track of it.

00:01:03.170 --> 00:01:07.170
And then finally,
we have 7/1000,

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:09.740
that's the 1000th place.

00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:14.100
So we could write
that, plus 7/1000.

00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:16.060
So if we would write
down everything

00:01:16.060 --> 00:01:18.710
that I just spoke
out loud, we would

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.730
say that this is 20-- let me
write that a little bit neater.

00:01:22.730 --> 00:01:29.130
This is 20,000.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:32.660
20,000 and 5/10.

00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:46.780
And 5-- let me write out the
word-- and 5/10 and 7/1000.

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.880
Now, this isn't the
only way to say this.

00:01:49.880 --> 00:01:52.320
Another way of
thinking about it is

00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:56.690
to try to merge the 5/10 and the
7/1000 in terms of thousandths.

00:01:56.690 --> 00:01:57.890
So let's think about this.

00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:00.380
So we could write this
as-- so once again, we

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.590
would have our 20,000.

00:02:03.590 --> 00:02:05.560
But instead of 5/10
and 7/1000, let's

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:07.846
write our 5/10 in
terms of thousandths.

00:02:07.846 --> 00:02:10.220
And the easiest way to do it
is to multiply the numerator

00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:12.580
and denominator,
both here, by 100.

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:14.990
So then we will
have-- so this 5/10

00:02:14.990 --> 00:02:20.930
is the same thing
as 500 over 1,000.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:25.900
And the 7/1000 is still 7/1000.

00:02:25.900 --> 00:02:32.150
And these two
combined are 507/1000.

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.560
So we could just call
this 20,000 and 507/1000.

00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:39.450
so let's write that down.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:03:06.140
So we could just say this
is 20,000 and 507/1000.

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.000
This is 1/1000, while this right
over here, 1,000, of course,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.280
actually represents 1,000.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.710
So we got 20 thousands,
that's that right over there,

00:03:16.710 --> 00:03:18.525
and 507/1000.
