00:00:00.110 --> 00:00:04.920
Get your tissues ready, because spring has
sprung!

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.160
-
Hey guys, Tara here for Dnews - and it is

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.269
officially that time of year!

00:00:13.269 --> 00:00:18.090
The birds are chirping, the flowers are blooming,
and if you're anything like me - your nose

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:21.400
is a disgusting faucet of neverending liquids.

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.230
BUT- before you go blaming pollen for those
pesky seasonal allergies - remember, you have

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.790
no one to blame but yourself.

00:00:27.790 --> 00:00:31.790
So, what's happening inside your body, when
you experience allergies?

00:00:31.790 --> 00:00:34.980
Well, it's basically one giant misunderstanding.

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:39.230
The first time you're exposed to an allergen
- your immune system investigates that allergen

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:44.899
and produces specific antibodies for it, which
are special cells designed to detect and stop

00:00:44.899 --> 00:00:46.020
foreign invasion.

00:00:46.020 --> 00:00:47.440
Typically, this is a good thing.

00:00:47.440 --> 00:00:49.550
It's what prevents you from getting sick.

00:00:49.550 --> 00:00:54.059
But in the case of allergies, your immune
system mistakes innocuous things like pollen

00:00:54.059 --> 00:00:56.690
and cat dander - for a serious threat.

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.280
And in response to that threat, your plasma
cells release a flood of these antibodies

00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:06.250
that attach to the surface of your mast cells,
causing them to burst open and release a flood

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.250
of histamine.

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:11.401
Histamine is what causes the swelling that
leads to various allergy-like symptoms, like

00:01:11.401 --> 00:01:13.750
runny nose, sneezing, or hives.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:18.120
But why do some people have such bad allergies,
and others not at all?

00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:21.960
There's no cut-and-dry answer to that question,
but genetics and environment seem to play

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.170
the two biggest roles.

00:01:23.170 --> 00:01:28.670
Research, for example, has shown that children
with one allergic parent have a 33% chance

00:01:28.670 --> 00:01:34.290
of developing allergies; and with two allergic
parents, that number goes up to 70%.

00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:38.659
Genetics are also the reason African-American
children experience three times as much sensitivity

00:01:38.659 --> 00:01:41.290
to food allergens, as Caucasian children.

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:45.450
In science, we're always taught that early
development is the most crucial stage of life

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:48.750
- and early exposure to allergens is no different.

00:01:48.750 --> 00:01:52.830
Research from Henry Ford Hospital shows that
having a pet in the house during your child's

00:01:52.830 --> 00:01:56.770
first year of life may protect him or her
from developing allergies.

00:01:56.770 --> 00:02:01.610
That same group also found that babies born
via c-section were six times more likely to

00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.180
be sensitive to dust mite allergens, than
babies born via natural birth.

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:10.090
Presumably, because they're not exposed to
the microbiome of bacteria present in the

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.670
mother's birth canal, which teaches their
immune system the difference between good

00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:15.050
and bad bacteria.

00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:19.120
This goes hand in hand with something called
the Hygiene Hypothesis, which aims to explain

00:02:19.120 --> 00:02:24.470
why allergies are more prevalent in wealthy,
industrialized nations, than developing countries.

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.040
Again, the idea is that a lack of early exposure
to parasites and bacteria typically found

00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:33.129
in developing nations - prevents our bodies
from being able to develop the appropriate

00:02:33.129 --> 00:02:34.300
immune response to them.

00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:38.160
So in the event we're actually exposed to
dangerous agents, our bodies simply don't

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.440
know how to deal with it.

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.670
So, what can we do about seasonal allergies,
if our bodies just refuse to cooperate?

00:02:43.670 --> 00:02:46.830
Anti-histamines can alleviate the symptoms
- but they're not gonna make you any less

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:49.170
allergic to a substance you're already allergic
to.

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.620
Some studies tout alternative remedies - like
acupuncture, or eating locally grown honey

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:56.239
- but most of those have anecdotal effects.

00:02:56.239 --> 00:03:00.500
The only proven treatment for respiratory
allergies - is immunotherapy, where you receive

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:06.470
increasing doses of whatever allergen you're
sensitive to, either orally - or via injection.

00:03:06.470 --> 00:03:10.810
That slow build-up of allergens, allows your
body to acclimate to them, which in turn,

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.920
improves your long-term tolerance.

00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:17.610
Not only is this an expensive option - if
you don't have insurance - it's also a time-consuming

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.569
process, that can take months or even years
to build up a sufficient tolerance.

00:03:20.569 --> 00:03:25.189
In the most extreme cases, people with severe
allergies can resort to rush immunotherapy

00:03:25.189 --> 00:03:29.170
- which is the same thing, but on a much tighter
timeline.

00:03:29.170 --> 00:03:33.819
So instead of spreading out your doses over
several months or years, you receive all of

00:03:33.819 --> 00:03:34.819
them.

00:03:34.819 --> 00:03:35.819
In a week.

00:03:35.819 --> 00:03:37.989
One long, miserable, neverending week.

00:03:37.989 --> 00:03:41.500
Still better than a lifetime of sneezing,
though - that much I can tell you.

00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:45.220
I got tested for allergies my first year of
college - and discovered I was allergic to

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:51.140
all 71 allergens they tested me for, including
both American and German cockroaches.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.319
So, yeah.

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:53.710
I'm pretty wordly.

00:03:53.710 --> 00:03:57.400
I know there's weirder stuff out there, though
- so let us know what YOU'RE allergic to,
