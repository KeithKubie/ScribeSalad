00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:11.209
The biggest problem I have with having the
entirety of human knowledge at my fingertips

00:00:11.209 --> 00:00:15.059
anywhere I go is that it’s NOT QUITE FAST
ENOUGH.

00:00:15.059 --> 00:00:23.890
Surrender your mysteries to me, internet!!!

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:28.050
Hello out there my fellow wireless human beings,
Julian here for DNews.

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:30.170
Radio waves have changed how we communicate.

00:00:30.170 --> 00:00:36.140
When Guglielmo Marconi sent his first transatlantic
transmission in 1901, it sparked a revolution.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.940
Suddenly information could be sent anywhere,
no strings or wires attached.

00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:44.680
Mastery of radio waves has brought us entertainment,
kept us in touch with space probes, and, most

00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:48.680
importantly to me, made the internet accessible
everywhere.

00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:52.290
Of course, there are limits to how much data
wireless communications can carry, and that’s

00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:56.590
why we still use fiber optic cables to send
data in bulk across oceans.

00:00:56.590 --> 00:01:01.030
Fiber optics suffer less interference, have
extremely low latency (or lag, for my gamers

00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:04.369
out there), and have achieved data rates of
1 petabit per second.

00:01:04.369 --> 00:01:09.020
That’s well over 3 MILLION times faster
than the wifi in my house…

00:01:09.020 --> 00:01:11.090
I’m going to have to call my internet provider.

00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:15.290
Typical fiber optic systems are more in the
10 to 40 Gigabit per second range though,

00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:20.880
which is still absurdly fast, 10 to 40 times
faster than the cat5 ethernet cables in your

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:21.909
home can handle.

00:01:21.909 --> 00:01:27.450
And now scientists at USC have figured out
how to match those speeds with radio waves.

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:31.910
They’ve transmitted 32 Gigabits per second
by sending multiple radio beams through a

00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:36.630
spiral phase plate that twisted them into
orthogonal helical structures.

00:01:36.630 --> 00:01:40.900
If you don’t think that’s the coolest
thing ever then we can’t be friends.

00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:46.020
The same team has used a similar trick to
transmit over 2.5 terabits per second using

00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:50.119
light beams, but those don’t have the same
robustness to deal with obstacles that longer

00:01:50.119 --> 00:01:51.350
radio waves have.

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:57.240
To put the speed in perspective, 32 Gigabits
per second is 30 times faster than LTE wireless,

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.680
it’s fast enough to transmit 10 hour-and-a-half
HD movies in a second.

00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:07.979
That’s every episode of Seinfeld ever in
4.5 seconds.

00:02:07.979 --> 00:02:09.479
In HD.

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:12.560
Think of all the joy this will bring to the
world!

00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:16.980
Right now it’s only been successfully used
at a distance of a little over 8 feet.

00:02:16.980 --> 00:02:21.880
Future research will work to extend the range
and may one day be applied to speed up cellular

00:02:21.880 --> 00:02:26.140
systems and bring your 4G LTE phones up to
actual 4G.

00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:30.640
So if Android comes out with a phone that’s
exclusively on a faster network will that

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.070
be enough to make the apple pickers jump ship?

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:37.510
Probably not, but Ross Everrett explains the
psychology of fanboys and how to break the

00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:40.360
cycle in this episode of DNews.

00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:43.630
What other miracle of technology just isn’t
good enough for you?

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:47.640
Let us know what little extra nudge your world
needs that would make your life easier in

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:48.640
the comments.

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.420
For me, it’s a pillow that turns my brain
off.

00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:52.730
Get on it, science!

00:02:52.730 --> 00:02:55.069
Until then, I’ll see you next time on DNews.
