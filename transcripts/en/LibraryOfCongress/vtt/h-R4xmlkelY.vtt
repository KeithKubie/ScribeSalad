&gt;&gt; From the Library of
Congress in Washington, D.C.

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:23.920
&gt;&gt; Arnold Wiggins: Greetings,

00:00:23.920 --> 00:00:28.320
welcome to another Daniel A.P.
Murphy African American Cultural

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:37.770
Association event, special event,
co-sponsored by EEO DP Programs.

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:43.000
Today is a very, very
blessed and special day.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.510
I'm talking off the top of my head

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:50.890
because I think I know Bern
Nadette Stanis AKA Thelma Evans.

00:00:50.890 --> 00:00:54.500
[Background noise] We all do,
let's give her a warm welcome.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:01:01.800
Let's stand up for Miss
Bern Nadette Stanis.

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:07.440
Today she's going to be
discussing her life and memoire.

00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:10.290
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Thank
you so much, thank you everyone.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:13.690
I'm overwhelmed, I didn't
know so many people would come

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:16.520
out this morning, but
thank you anyway.

00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:22.320
I'm just going to give you a little
brief thing of my life story and ,

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.670
you know how I got to
certain points in my life

00:01:24.670 --> 00:01:27.780
and some lessons I've
learned along the way

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:29.470
from the parents that I've had.

00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:33.600
And you know living, you know
5 years in Good Times and,

00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:37.110
those things and how I became
an author and things like that.

00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:40.060
Well I was born and
raised in Brooklyn,

00:01:40.060 --> 00:01:42.210
in the Brownsville
section of Brooklyn.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:45.420
I guess you guys know
where that is right?

00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:47.660
It's the projects.

00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:48.960
So there were 5 of us.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.150
I'm the eldest of 5 and my mom
and dad in a 2 bedroom apartment.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:55.120
So you can imagine.

00:01:55.120 --> 00:01:58.440
But my father's thing was
education, with education

00:01:58.440 --> 00:02:02.310
and determination you can do
anything in the world you want.

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:06.890
So he spent all, he and mommy,
spent their money on educating us,

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:08.860
putting us through
parochial schools,

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.450
all kind of private
schools, dance classes,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:14.690
you know music classes,
and things like that.

00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:18.720 position:56%
And you know I can remember going to
school, it was like 10 blocks away

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:20.810
from you know where we lived.

00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:24.690
And it was called Our Lady of
Loreto and on the way there,

00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:28.930
I learned a lot of things, about
the neighborhood, about life.

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:33.440
And what we would see all the
time would be the heroin addicts,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.350
you know, going, when
I was going to school,

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:39.550 position:56%
now you know what heroin addicts do.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:42.190
And the hands on the
heroin addicts were

00:02:42.190 --> 00:02:44.810
like three times the
size that they should be.

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:51.160
And what we would do is, as
children we would make bets as to

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:55.830 position:56%
which one would fall, you know which
one would hit the ground first.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:59.190
And as you know, they never fall.

00:02:59.190 --> 00:03:00.490
&gt;&gt; That's right.

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.790
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
It was amazing.

00:03:01.790 --> 00:03:04.340
They would go all the
way down to the ground

00:03:04.340 --> 00:03:05.640
and never fall [laughter].

00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:07.670
We just thought that was amazing.

00:03:07.670 --> 00:03:11.980 position:56%
So I'm just saying that this was
the kind of environment I came from.

00:03:11.980 --> 00:03:14.980
And what my father
always said was this,

00:03:14.980 --> 00:03:16.990
what's around you does
not have to be in you.

00:03:16.990 --> 00:03:22.080
And he made sure that
we understood that.

00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:25.630
He was a very wonderful daddy,
he was a very disciplinarian,

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:30.090
he was very strong in that way at
education and being disciplined.

00:03:30.090 --> 00:03:33.930
Mother, on the other
hand, a southern gal,

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:36.800
you know from Jeanerette,
Louisiana, she was very,

00:03:36.800 --> 00:03:39.670
very soft spoken but
very, very stern.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:41.740
And she meant what she said.

00:03:41.740 --> 00:03:45.050
Some of the lessons that I learned
from them, I'll just jump ahead.

00:03:45.050 --> 00:03:50.290
My grandmother put me in dance
class at the age of 5 years old

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:53.280
and told my mother
to keep me in dance.

00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:55.230
And I think she did
that because she knew

00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:59.710
that if you were busy doing
something positive there's less

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:02.570
opportunity to get into
something negative.

00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:07.790
So I stayed in dance class all
of my life to become a dancer.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:14.900 position:56%
Now, I remember a lesson, one of the
lessons that I learned, from my mom.

00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:17.260
I was about in the tenth grade,

00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:20.620
no I was about in the fifth
grade and I was 10 years old.

00:04:20.620 --> 00:04:25.350
And there were two girls in my
class that I wanted to be a part

00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:28.540
of their clique, that's when
I learned about cliques.

00:04:28.540 --> 00:04:33.040
And [laughter] I wanted to
be a part of them so badly

00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:36.740
because they were beautiful,
they were smart,

00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.670 position:56%
they were everything I wanted to be.

00:04:39.670 --> 00:04:43.700
I was the type of student
that, I was very creative

00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:47.370
but I was like a B, C student.

00:04:47.370 --> 00:04:50.280
So they didn't want
me in their clique.

00:04:50.280 --> 00:04:53.450
I figured this out from the
first grade to the fifth grade.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.940
Now what I figured out was this,
if I can become an A student

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.440
like they were, then I would
automatically you know,

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.700
be part of their clique.

00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:08.060
So I studied and I
became an A student.

00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.280
This one test was very,
very hard and I got an A

00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.430
and I was so excited, so happy.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:16.280
So in recess here I am, you know
they're playing double Dutch,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:18.230
you all know about
double Dutch [laughter].

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:24.250
And I am walking over to them
and say okay, can I play?

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.580
And they looked at me like they
always looked at me and said no.

00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:32.020
No you can't play.

00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:35.430
Well that was a lesson
that, that I'll never forget

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.760
because it really, really hurt me.

00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:41.230
I did not understand that, I didn't
understand why I was not accepted,

00:05:41.230 --> 00:05:42.810
why they didn't like me.

00:05:42.810 --> 00:05:47.300
So again I go home that day crying,
you know, asking my mommy, why,

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:49.630 position:56%
why don't they accept me mommy, why?

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:53.840
And she says, I don't know why
Bern Nadette, I really don't.

00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.860
She said but listen, you are
very creative, you can dance,

00:05:57.860 --> 00:06:01.440
you can draw, you can
paint, you can write.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:05.290
I'm like ugh, that's not
what a child wants to hear

00:06:05.290 --> 00:06:08.340 position:56%
in a situation like that [laughter].

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.880
So I moped around and I moped
around that whole evening.

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:17.980
And I, I'm very religious and
I believe in God very strongly

00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:21.490
and I think that is
because my mom did too.

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:26.480
And sometimes I believe that,
we get messages from God

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:29.250
to help us guide our children.

00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:33.920
And I know that this had to have
happened for my mother, this day.

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:37.260
So she came in the living room
and she sat right next to me

00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:40.410
and she said, Bern Nadette,

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:45.650
one day the whole world is
going to know your name.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.970
Yet she didn't tell me that Thelma
would be the first name [laughter]

00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:56.670
instead of Bern Nadette, she didn't
tell me that part [laughter].

00:06:56.670 --> 00:06:59.850
So, so I said okay mom,
whatever, but that,

00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:02.580
but you know the clique thing
faded away and I continued on

00:07:02.580 --> 00:07:04.750
and to do what I, you know do.

00:07:04.750 --> 00:07:06.960
Another lesson was this.

00:07:06.960 --> 00:07:09.990
I learned a lot about my
mother's character from this.

00:07:09.990 --> 00:07:14.170
There was a beauty
pageant, and I wanted to be

00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.340
in it but I was too young.

00:07:16.340 --> 00:07:23.330
The pageant, Miss Black America
was from 18 on and I was about 14.

00:07:23.330 --> 00:07:29.110
And my mother said, you know there
should be a pageant for teenagers,

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:31.520
they want to get in
these things too.

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:35.810
So of course, being the mother
that she was, she went to the head

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:38.380
of the pageant you know thing.

00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.280
And Mr. Hal Jackson
was the leader then.

00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:47.620 position:56%
And she went over to him and she
said, Mr. Jackson, my daughter is 14

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.880
and I know a lot of teenagers
want to get into pageants

00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.260
so why don't you have
a teenage pageant?

00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:57.120
The very next year he
had that teenage pageant.

00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.200
So, well what I learned
from that was

00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:04.360
that when there is no
way you can make a way,

00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:07.820
if there's no door you can
make a door to walk through.

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.020 position:56%
And my mother made that door for me.

00:08:10.020 --> 00:08:14.980
Now, I am going to the beauty
pageant every Sunday with my mother

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:18.730
and her other four children,
so, all the way to Manhattan,

00:08:18.730 --> 00:08:21.880
so it takes about, about
an hour to get there.

00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.720
We did this for about 6 weeks

00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:27.380
and the seventh week was
the pageant, that Sunday.

00:08:27.380 --> 00:08:35.300
And I got up that morning and I
looked in the mirror, and I said,

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:39.320
I am not going to that
pageant [laughter].

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.860
Not me, I meant that to, so I moped
around, I looked kind of strange.

00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.290
And my mother says you
better start getting dressed,

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.750
it's about that time.

00:08:49.750 --> 00:08:52.040
I said mom, I'm going
to tell you something,

00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:55.160
I'm not going to do
it, I'm not going.

00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.160
You know she laughed right?

00:08:57.160 --> 00:08:59.920
She said you better
get dressed, stop that.

00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:03.260
I'm like no, I really
mean it, I'm not, I'm not.

00:09:03.260 --> 00:09:05.260
And she said yes you are.

00:09:05.260 --> 00:09:09.840
So you know I don't bugger
too much but, I acted out.

00:09:09.840 --> 00:09:13.170
I moved like molasses I was
hoping that I would move so slow

00:09:13.170 --> 00:09:16.680
that the pageant would be over
when we get there, but it wasn't.

00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.090
Finally, we're on the subway,
and I would not sit next to her

00:09:21.090 --> 00:09:23.970
because I'm very angry
at her by this point.

00:09:23.970 --> 00:09:27.830
And, you know if you
do have a little bit

00:09:27.830 --> 00:09:29.570
of asthma you can make
asthma [laughter].

00:09:29.570 --> 00:09:37.140
So I sat up there and I mustered
up an asthma attack, oh yes I did,

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:40.630
I did it I went [laughter].

00:09:42.150 --> 00:09:43.650
Until I couldn't catch my breath.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:51.590
So by the time we got off
the subway, I, here I am.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:52.890
Mom [laughter].

00:09:52.890 --> 00:10:01.000
I can't [heavy breathing] you know
we know our children [laughter].

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.610
My mother looked across the
street at the drug store

00:10:04.610 --> 00:10:06.410
and she said you see that
drug store over there?

00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:08.980
We're going to go over there, get
that Primatene mist [laughter].

00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:14.320
Now you know Primatene mist you
can get, back in those days,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:16.540
and you're going to take it and
you're going to get on that stage

00:10:16.540 --> 00:10:18.510
and do what you're supposed
to do you know all that.

00:10:18.510 --> 00:10:22.050
So I just said well boy
it's over now [laughter].

00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:25.160
I got to get well and I got to
get up on that stage and I did.

00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:29.970
And it was that Sunday,
that a man came to my mom

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:34.110
and said you know we're looking
for a teenager for a show,

00:10:34.110 --> 00:10:37.220
and it looks like your
daughter could fit right in.

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:40.640
And so we're going to give you this
card and we would like you to go

00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:45.000
to CVS tomorrow and meet Norman
Lear and you know audition.

00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.790
So my mom took me the next day
to CVS and we go up to the room

00:10:50.790 --> 00:10:55.580
and we open the door, and
there are thousands of girls.

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:59.200
I'm like wow.

00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.000
So anyway, you know I knew not
to act up because you know,

00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.730
the day before wasn't
so good for me.

00:11:04.730 --> 00:11:11.350
So anyway, [laughter] I sat there
and I started thinking to myself,

00:11:11.350 --> 00:11:15.010
and I said, I thought about
something my dad always said.

00:11:15.010 --> 00:11:17.520
What's for you, no
one can take from you

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:20.440
and I kept saying that
and saying that.

00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:25.350
So when they called me in,
I see Norman sitting there,

00:11:25.350 --> 00:11:28.010
you know behind the desk,
Norman Lear the producer of All

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:30.830
in The Family, Jefferson's
and all these different shows.

00:11:30.830 --> 00:11:32.930
And of course I saw Jimmie
Walker standing there

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:38.330
with that dumb hat on
his head [laughter].

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:42.860
So, so they give me a script
to read and the script looks

00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.890
like it's somebody who wrote
it, what they thought a teenager

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:51.690
in the ghetto should say,
rather than what she says.

00:11:51.690 --> 00:11:59.130
So I say to Norman Lear, Mr. Leer
is it okay if I can improvise?

00:11:59.130 --> 00:12:01.690
Now because I had been
taking acting classes

00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:04.500
for awhile [laughter] I
knew how to improvise.

00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:07.830
So he looked at me and he
said, yes, go ahead improvise.

00:12:07.830 --> 00:12:09.800
You know he's got hundreds
of girls auditioning.

00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:15.400
So anyway I get up there and I
say to JJ, I said something like,

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.180
look JJ you better help me clean
this house before mommy gets here.

00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:21.620 position:56%
I mean you better wash those dishes,

00:12:21.620 --> 00:12:27.050
or you better take the garbage
out, something [laughter].

00:12:27.050 --> 00:12:31.200
So he says well I'm not washing
dishes and the garbage isn't full,

00:12:31.200 --> 00:12:33.100
so I'm not doing anything.

00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:35.050
So I, we were going back
and forth, back and forth,

00:12:35.050 --> 00:12:38.500
so I hit him, I did, I hit him.

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:39.800
I hit my brothers.

00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:43.620 position:56%
So I hit him on the arm and he goes,

00:12:43.620 --> 00:12:47.180
you know that long face he makes
that, and so we go back and forth

00:12:47.180 --> 00:12:48.870
and Norman starting laughing.

00:12:48.870 --> 00:12:52.550
So I, after that audition I didn't
hear anything back from them

00:12:52.550 --> 00:12:55.170
for like two months so after two
months you just say well okay

00:12:55.170 --> 00:12:56.860
it's over.

00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:58.900
And after two months
I got that call,

00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.510
my mother got that
call, that I was Thelma.

00:13:03.510 --> 00:13:10.110
[ Applause ]

00:13:10.110 --> 00:13:13.530
Thank you, but what I
learned from that was this,

00:13:13.530 --> 00:13:18.100
that morning that I got up and I
looked in that mirror, and I said,

00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:22.700
I'm not going, it was
only because of fear.

00:13:22.700 --> 00:13:26.630
It was, I was afraid that I
was not going to be picked

00:13:26.630 --> 00:13:30.840
or that I'm not pretty
enough or I'm not enough.

00:13:30.840 --> 00:13:36.590
And, fear got a hold of me and
it worked it, it worked it.

00:13:36.590 --> 00:13:42.500 position:56%
And what it taught me was this,
don't let fear stop you from walking

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.910
into your destiny, because truly
Good Times became my destiny.

00:13:48.910 --> 00:13:53.800
Although I always wanted to
be a doctor, a psychologist,

00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:58.240
a psychiatrist, only because
I love the way the mind is

00:13:58.240 --> 00:14:00.630
and why people do the
things they do.

00:14:00.630 --> 00:14:04.880
And especially got more
interested in it as I,

00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:08.330
you know grew up, and
started dating.

00:14:11.550 --> 00:14:14.300
Now, [laughter] I'll get
back to that [laughter].

00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:19.230
Now on Good Times, it was very,
very interesting because I was

00:14:19.230 --> 00:14:22.250
like the newcomer, I didn't
know anything about anything,

00:14:22.250 --> 00:14:26.450
I was just so excited to be
around them, and you know them,

00:14:26.450 --> 00:14:30.330
meaning the stars you know Esther
Rolle, John Amos, Ralph Carter,

00:14:30.330 --> 00:14:32.630 position:56%
and Jimmie Walker and Ja'net Dubois.

00:14:32.630 --> 00:14:36.540
They all were so acclaimed,
even at that time.

00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:40.180
And I learned a lot of lessons and
you know, I have a lot of lessons

00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:44.630
in my books to that I talk a
lot about what I've learned.

00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:50.990
But, it was one day I was at Esther
Rolle's house, now Esther Rolle

00:14:50.990 --> 00:14:53.580
and I became very, very close,

00:14:53.580 --> 00:14:57.180
because I wouldn't let
her go home by herself.

00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:02.020
I was always there, I would say
mom, can I go home with you?

00:15:02.020 --> 00:15:04.130
She said, why?

00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:05.510
What do you want from, what?

00:15:05.510 --> 00:15:07.960
I said I just want to
become, I loved her,

00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:09.270
I just wanted to be around her.

00:15:09.270 --> 00:15:10.830
So she just accepted
me as a daughter

00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.070
because I wasn't going
anywhere [laughter].

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:16.450
So here we are rehearsing our
little lines, now remember,

00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:19.760
in the beginning, the first
6 months, all Thelma had

00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:23.100
to do was say hi mom,
hi dad, shut up JJ,

00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.100
she was in the bathroom right.

00:15:27.100 --> 00:15:30.910
So this went on for like 6
months and I was getting bored.

00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:32.210
I really was.

00:15:32.210 --> 00:15:35.210
So I told, I said mom, you
know I'm getting kind of bored,

00:15:35.210 --> 00:15:37.770
you know I think I could do more
lines, I think I can do more.

00:15:37.770 --> 00:15:41.300
I want to do more [laughter].

00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:44.690
And she goes, oh you
know, oh really.

00:15:44.690 --> 00:15:50.580
Yeah. She says, so you
want to do more lines?

00:15:50.580 --> 00:15:57.240
Yes. She says, she waited a long
while, and then she said to me,

00:15:57.240 --> 00:16:00.340
okay, let me handle this.

00:16:00.340 --> 00:16:02.580
Oh I was so happy she said that,

00:16:02.580 --> 00:16:04.520
because I wouldn't know
how to handle that.

00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:07.800
So, the Friday that
we had the reading,

00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:11.370
because we always have readings
for the next script on Friday.

00:16:11.370 --> 00:16:15.630
Again, my lines were good morning,
hi mom, hi dad, and bathroom

00:16:15.630 --> 00:16:17.970
and hey shut up JJ, that's it.

00:16:17.970 --> 00:16:22.060
So at the end of the line reading,
Esther said to the producers,

00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:24.530
because in the line reading
we had the producers,

00:16:24.530 --> 00:16:26.340
the writers, everybody's there.

00:16:26.340 --> 00:16:28.710
And she said, I want
to ask a question,

00:16:28.710 --> 00:16:30.460
and they said of course Esther,

00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.190
you know what is it,
you know she's the star.

00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:35.060
So she, you know does
what she wants.

00:16:35.060 --> 00:16:39.520
So she says, I want
to ask something,

00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:41.710
are you ashamed of my daughter?

00:16:41.710 --> 00:16:45.800
And they said no, why?

00:16:45.800 --> 00:16:47.530
We're not ashamed of her.

00:16:47.530 --> 00:16:51.110
Well then why are you hiding her?

00:16:51.110 --> 00:16:53.600
They said well we're not
trying to hide her or anything.

00:16:53.600 --> 00:16:57.170
So she said well I want my
daughter to have more lines,

00:16:57.170 --> 00:16:59.590
I want my daughter to have a voice.

00:16:59.590 --> 00:17:04.290
My baby son has a voice,
my older son has a voice,

00:17:04.290 --> 00:17:07.560
and I want my daughter
to have a voice.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:12.390
And so from that moment on I
had a voice, Thelma had a voice.

00:17:12.390 --> 00:17:14.060
She had an opinion.

00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:16.930
So I give Esther Rolle
all the credit

00:17:16.930 --> 00:17:21.250
for giving the first black
female teenager on television,

00:17:21.250 --> 00:17:23.510
her voice and her opinion.

00:17:23.510 --> 00:17:30.240
[ Applause ]

00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:38.800
I've got to have a
little water here, yeah.

00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:43.640
Now while on the show,
some things happened.

00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:50.290
While on the show, I lost
my voice in the third year.

00:17:50.290 --> 00:17:55.650
Mmm hmm, what happened was I
would get up in the morning

00:17:55.650 --> 00:18:00.400
and I would sound like me but by
3, or 4 or 5 o'clock I started

00:18:00.400 --> 00:18:02.240
to sound like, more like a man.

00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:05.640
And then in the evening
I could hardly talk

00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:08.600
and my voice started to hurt.

00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:11.260
So I went to a specialist to
find out what was going on.

00:18:11.260 --> 00:18:15.440
And he said that you have
nodules on your vocal cords.

00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.800
And they have to be removed.

00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:23.030
Removed, so I'm saying okay
so what does that entail.

00:18:23.030 --> 00:18:28.270
So they say well, once we remove
them, it's two ways that it can go.

00:18:28.270 --> 00:18:32.060
You could lose your voice, or
you can get your voice back,

00:18:32.060 --> 00:18:36.400
but you will have to be
quiet for like about 6 weeks.

00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:38.700
&gt;&gt; Wow, wow [laughter].

00:18:40.190 --> 00:18:41.490
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Quiet, me?

00:18:41.490 --> 00:18:43.830
I'm always on the phone,
I'm always talking,

00:18:43.830 --> 00:18:47.150
I can't, be quiet for 6 weeks.

00:18:47.150 --> 00:18:50.530
So I told the producers what
the doctor said and everything,

00:18:50.530 --> 00:18:55.910
and so they suggested that after
the operation what I should do is,

00:18:55.910 --> 00:19:01.240
study the lines but don't speak,
just speak on Thursdays, tape day.

00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.130
And the doctor said
that would be fine

00:19:03.130 --> 00:19:05.070
and it ended up being very fine.

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:09.970
So that's exactly what I did but in
that process, you know I realized,

00:19:09.970 --> 00:19:13.530
you know looking back, that,
you know since I do believe

00:19:13.530 --> 00:19:17.020
in God very strongly I know
that he moves in certain ways.

00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:22.980
And for me I did not understand why
my voice was silenced for 6 weeks,

00:19:22.980 --> 00:19:26.430
but in that process,
this is what happened.

00:19:26.430 --> 00:19:31.400
I decided that I was going
to write everybody stuff,

00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:34.700
you know how you'd get a pad, a pen
and you just write down everything

00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:37.750
and show it to them, and then
they can talk back to you.

00:19:37.750 --> 00:19:41.270
Well back then they didn't have
texts and spell check and all

00:19:41.270 --> 00:19:44.050
that [laughter], so
that got ridiculous.

00:19:44.050 --> 00:19:46.650
So I just decided,
okay I'll shut up then.

00:19:46.650 --> 00:19:52.420
But in the process, God gave
me something very precious,

00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:57.850
he gave me poetry, and
he gave me stories,

00:19:57.850 --> 00:20:01.720 position:56%
and he gave me the ability to write.

00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:05.070
I developed it right there and
then and I never stopped writing,

00:20:05.070 --> 00:20:11.690
and writing poetry, and
beautiful things like that.

00:20:11.690 --> 00:20:21.010
Years later, like 30 years later, I
kind of realized why that happened.

00:20:21.010 --> 00:20:31.340
My mom by this time was
diagnosed with Alzheimer's, and,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:35.960
and before that, like
I said I always studied

00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:39.020
about relationships
and things like that.

00:20:39.020 --> 00:20:43.470
So I knew a lot about
relationships by this time.

00:20:43.470 --> 00:20:45.680
I used to ask my mother
before she got Alzheimer's,

00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.690
I used to say when I was
younger, hey mom tell me,

00:20:48.690 --> 00:20:51.010
you know what should I do about
this guy and what should I do

00:20:51.010 --> 00:20:53.400
and how should I handle this
and how should I handle that.

00:20:53.400 --> 00:20:56.430
And she says, well Bern Nadette
you know, I've only been married

00:20:56.430 --> 00:20:58.900
to one man, I don't know
how these things work.

00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.770
So what you need to do is
read everything you can learn,

00:21:02.770 --> 00:21:06.680
so that's why I did that.

00:21:09.780 --> 00:21:13.480
But, [laughter] okay by this time
I realized that I was working

00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:18.450
on a book and the book
came about like this.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:20.710
And it's called Situations
101, Relationships,

00:21:20.710 --> 00:21:23.790
The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly.

00:21:23.790 --> 00:21:29.380
And, at first I was just the
girl that everybody would come

00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:32.380
to to ask questions
about relationships,

00:21:32.380 --> 00:21:35.330
like I was the girlfriend
that you would call.

00:21:35.330 --> 00:21:37.660
Guys, girls, are going to call
me, they would ask me something

00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.490 position:56%
and I would tell them and it worked.

00:21:39.490 --> 00:21:44.270
So, they always did that,
except I had one girlfriend,

00:21:44.270 --> 00:21:47.520
who would call me all the time,
but this time she calls me

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.150
like at 3 in the morning.

00:21:49.150 --> 00:21:53.250
And she keeps calling me,
until I answer the phone.

00:21:53.250 --> 00:21:59.210
So when I answer the phone, she
said he's not home, he's not home.

00:21:59.210 --> 00:22:01.990
I'm like who's not home?

00:22:01.990 --> 00:22:06.010
The same guy she was talking
to me about for 3 years,

00:22:06.010 --> 00:22:07.500
the same guy, he's not home.

00:22:07.500 --> 00:22:09.220
Well I said how do you
know he's not home,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:12.580
maybe he's asleep,
it's 3 in the morning.

00:22:12.580 --> 00:22:15.050
No, he's not home, why?

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:17.570
Because I kept calling him and
he wouldn't answer the phone.

00:22:17.570 --> 00:22:19.790 position:56%
So, how many times did you call him?

00:22:19.790 --> 00:22:22.150
About, I don't know
15, 20, I don't know.

00:22:22.150 --> 00:22:29.080
15, 20 times, this is a
problem and I can't solve it.

00:22:29.080 --> 00:22:32.590
So what I said to her was this,
I'm going to write down some things

00:22:32.590 --> 00:22:36.100
for you so that you can put it in,
on your refrigerator in the middle

00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:38.730
of the night if you can't
sleep and you're worried

00:22:38.730 --> 00:22:42.230
about him not being home, maybe if
you read it it will calm you down,

00:22:42.230 --> 00:22:45.400
until at least about 6 [laughter].

00:22:45.400 --> 00:22:51.460
You know and if that doesn't
work, then do like I do,

00:22:51.460 --> 00:23:00.060
open the refrigerator and
eat something [laughter].

00:23:00.060 --> 00:23:03.830
So she just whatever and so anyway
I started writing these things down

00:23:03.830 --> 00:23:09.750
and that's how I ended up writing
this book called Situations 101,

00:23:09.750 --> 00:23:11.620
Relationships, The Good,
The Bad, and The Ugly.

00:23:11.620 --> 00:23:16.230
I did 101 different situations
that I had heard and answers

00:23:16.230 --> 00:23:18.840
that I had given them,
and I realized

00:23:18.840 --> 00:23:22.240
that you know people really
needed that, it was interesting.

00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:25.550
But in that process I would always
call my mom and we would talk

00:23:25.550 --> 00:23:28.890
about the relationship stuff and
some of the things in the book,

00:23:28.890 --> 00:23:30.190
The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,

00:23:30.190 --> 00:23:32.350
and I'm saying mom you think
I should put that in the book.

00:23:32.350 --> 00:23:36.720
And she says well if it's real put
it in there, it may help somebody.

00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:41.180
Right after that book was
done, my brother called me

00:23:41.180 --> 00:23:44.520
and said you know it's time
for you to come get mommy

00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.520
because mommy's not doing so well.

00:23:47.520 --> 00:23:50.690
When I went to see her, I realized
that she wasn't doing so well,

00:23:50.690 --> 00:23:56.000
she spoke well, she hid it
well, but her hair wasn't right.

00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:00.390
And you don't put polka
dots and stripes together.

00:24:00.390 --> 00:24:04.640
So I said you know
something is really wrong,

00:24:04.640 --> 00:24:07.790
I said okay mommy you're coming
home with me and we're going to,

00:24:07.790 --> 00:24:09.640
you know see what's
going on, you know.

00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:12.490
I never made her feel
funny about it.

00:24:12.490 --> 00:24:16.510
So we went to the doctor and they
diagnosed her with Alzheimer's.

00:24:16.510 --> 00:24:21.110
And when the doctor did that
he looked at me and he said,

00:24:21.110 --> 00:24:25.370
your mother has something that
we call, you know Alzheimer's,

00:24:25.370 --> 00:24:28.730
and I'm going to give you some
medication and you give it to her,

00:24:28.730 --> 00:24:33.150
and it should, you know
help her out a little.

00:24:33.150 --> 00:24:34.950
I'm like what?

00:24:34.950 --> 00:24:36.860
Help her out a little about what?

00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.670
What is that?

00:24:38.670 --> 00:24:43.770
Well it's, and he looked
at me like this.

00:24:43.770 --> 00:24:49.940
And I got very angry with him
because I thought that was rude,

00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.760
you know, but not knowing
what he knew.

00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:56.330
So I said okay, okay we'll give
her the medicine but you know what,

00:24:56.330 --> 00:24:58.570
mommy, we're going
to fix this thing.

00:24:58.570 --> 00:25:01.000
We have come through everything,
we're going to fix this thing

00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:02.300
and we'll give you
a lot of vitamins,

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.350
a lot of this, a lot of that.

00:25:04.350 --> 00:25:06.780
And I was fighting for it,
and I was on the internet

00:25:06.780 --> 00:25:09.970
and I was asking questions,
and I said no, no,

00:25:09.970 --> 00:25:13.410
there's got to be an answer to
this thing, this is not real.

00:25:13.410 --> 00:25:19.280
They said there is no
answer, there is no cure.

00:25:19.280 --> 00:25:22.460
I know there is a cure,
this can't be happening.

00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:28.400
I fought for 4 or 5 years
with there must be a cure.

00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:32.010
Until I start seeing
what it really was doing.

00:25:32.010 --> 00:25:39.150
The decline, you know, and the
mourning that a caregiver goes

00:25:39.150 --> 00:25:44.400
through while watching
your loved one decline.

00:25:44.400 --> 00:25:47.730
My mother was so sweet, stayed
sweet, and was wonderful.

00:25:47.730 --> 00:25:49.670
She didn't have a problem with it,

00:25:49.670 --> 00:25:52.610
I don't think she really
realized how sick she was

00:25:52.610 --> 00:25:55.610
or what this thing was.

00:25:55.610 --> 00:26:00.630
And, but I realized it, and
that's why I wrote the book

00:26:00.630 --> 00:26:04.930
about The Last Night, a Caregiver's
Journey Through Transition

00:26:04.930 --> 00:26:09.160
and Beyond, because I
realized that I took

00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:12.530
on the weight of this disease.

00:26:12.530 --> 00:26:17.630
My mother would eat and forget
that she was, had eaten.

00:26:17.630 --> 00:26:20.880
And she would always
invite me to eat with her,

00:26:20.880 --> 00:26:23.700
so I kept eating with her.

00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:28.750
Now she would get skinny and
I would get fat [laughter].

00:26:28.750 --> 00:26:32.270
But I didn't even realize that
I was gaining so much weight.

00:26:32.270 --> 00:26:35.400
I mean I remember going to
the store, to buy some clothes

00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.270
because you know my clothes
weren't really fitting anymore.

00:26:39.270 --> 00:26:41.260
And so I tried on this size,

00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.170
I'm not going to tell you
what size it is [laughter].

00:26:45.170 --> 00:26:49.550
And I realized, I'm like oh come
on now these people, come on,

00:26:49.550 --> 00:26:52.510
they're making the
clothes too small.

00:26:52.510 --> 00:26:58.170
[ Laughter ]

00:26:58.170 --> 00:26:59.590
But then I really realized,

00:26:59.590 --> 00:27:02.510
yeah I guess I had gained
some weight, you know.

00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.140
But that didn't matter to
me, my mother was going,

00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:09.790
my mother was dying, and I knew it
and I'm still fighting with her.

00:27:09.790 --> 00:27:14.270
And everything, she asked me or
said I said yes, I agree, I agree,

00:27:14.270 --> 00:27:15.980
I agree, everything's fine.

00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:22.020
And then one day we were
watching Good Times [laughter].

00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:28.320
One of her favorites, and she was
watching JJ and me and Thelma fight

00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.550
and everything, and she and
I were just sitting alone.

00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:34.560
And she looked about
me and she said,

00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:38.510
you know that's a cute
little old girl.

00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:43.380
[ Laughter ]

00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:46.630
And I said yeah, yeah ma she is.

00:27:46.630 --> 00:27:50.770
But at the same time it was like a
knife in my heart that was twisted.

00:27:50.770 --> 00:27:55.300
Because this monster of the mind
had taken away, from my mother,

00:27:55.300 --> 00:27:58.510
the very thing that
had changed our lives.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:04.590
And I realized then this thing
is very serious, very serious.

00:28:04.590 --> 00:28:09.400
And so I said, if and
when that day does come,

00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:10.900
I'm going to form a foundation

00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.310
for my mother called
Remembering The Good Times

00:28:14.310 --> 00:28:18.510
and Alzheimer's Foundation
in her honor.

00:28:18.510 --> 00:28:25.130
[ Applause ]

00:28:25.130 --> 00:28:29.870
But anyway, that day did come.

00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:34.110
And if we have a few more
minutes I'll explain it but.

00:28:34.110 --> 00:28:35.410
&gt;&gt; Sure.

00:28:35.410 --> 00:28:38.690
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis We do?

00:28:38.690 --> 00:28:39.990
&gt;&gt; Yes.

00:28:39.990 --> 00:28:42.290
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Okay.

00:28:44.310 --> 00:28:49.750
The reason why I call it
the last night is because,

00:28:49.750 --> 00:28:52.160
the day before the last night,

00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:57.060
I spent with my mother,
I was a nervous wreck.

00:28:57.060 --> 00:29:03.310
I felt something it's as if God
was whispering in my ear, you know.

00:29:03.310 --> 00:29:05.910
And everything was
going wrong, everything.

00:29:05.910 --> 00:29:11.780
By this time, mother had stopped
speaking, no she was speaking

00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:14.620
but she was not swallowing,
she was not.

00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:17.870
So she was in the hospital with
the tubes down at her throat

00:29:17.870 --> 00:29:20.420
and all this other stuff and
they're telling that she's going

00:29:20.420 --> 00:29:21.720
to get a splint in the
arm and everything,

00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:24.140
my mom does not want all that.

00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:29.420
So anyway, the day
before, I was panicking

00:29:29.420 --> 00:29:33.290
and I told the doctors please you
know, my mother doesn't look well,

00:29:33.290 --> 00:29:35.370
you know, is there more
medicine you can give her,

00:29:35.370 --> 00:29:36.670
is there anything else?

00:29:36.670 --> 00:29:38.360
You know more oxygen, something.

00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.790
And they're saying your
mother is very ill.

00:29:40.790 --> 00:29:45.530
I said I know she's very ill,
that's why I'm asking you

00:29:45.530 --> 00:29:47.140 position:56%
to give her more medicine, help her.

00:29:47.140 --> 00:29:50.880
Give her some antibiotics,
give her something.

00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:56.500
They said okay, we're going to do
that, because they realized I'm one

00:29:56.500 --> 00:30:00.120
of those that you know,
didn't see the light.

00:30:00.120 --> 00:30:04.810 position:56%
So that evening I went by there, I
went by to see mommy and I said mom,

00:30:04.810 --> 00:30:06.330
it's about 10 o'clock now.

00:30:06.330 --> 00:30:08.190
I said mom, I'm going to go

00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:11.040
to the Alzheimer's Association
tomorrow morning and I'm going

00:30:11.040 --> 00:30:13.950 position:56%
to speak about you because you know,
I have to speak about, you know,

00:30:13.950 --> 00:30:16.300
Alzheimer's that morning,
the next morning.

00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.280
So I said but I'll be here
about 11 o'clock okay?

00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:23.020
She said fine, and she
nodded, you know she heard me.

00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:27.550
And so, it was just myself and
my daughter who was about 16

00:30:27.550 --> 00:30:30.270
at the time, my baby daughter.

00:30:30.270 --> 00:30:34.700
And she and I went home and
she lay on one couch and I lay

00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:37.520
on the other couch, my husband
was in New York at the time,

00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:40.070
and my older daughter
was at her apartment.

00:30:40.070 --> 00:30:49.310
So about 2:30 in the morning,
the phone rang, and I froze

00:30:49.310 --> 00:30:53.430
and my baby said ma, answer
the phone, it's the hospital,

00:30:53.430 --> 00:30:55.390
answer the phone, you know.

00:30:55.390 --> 00:30:58.700
And I let it, I didn't,
I let it go to voicemail.

00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.770
She said mommy, you
better call them back.

00:31:02.770 --> 00:31:06.400
So I listened to my
voicemail, and they said come

00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:09.860
in because your mother's
vitals are failing.

00:31:09.860 --> 00:31:15.500
And you never know what you're
going to do at that moment,

00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:19.630
when you've had your parent all of
your life, and that moment is here.

00:31:19.630 --> 00:31:25.120
So what I did was, I really froze,
now I know that it was coming but,

00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:28.710
at that moment I froze,
and I couldn't move.

00:31:28.710 --> 00:31:33.640
And she's saying mommy, come on,
I'm standing there walking around,

00:31:33.640 --> 00:31:35.750
talking to myself and
saying to myself this is it,

00:31:35.750 --> 00:31:37.910
this can't be it, this is it.

00:31:37.910 --> 00:31:41.020
And I could not get it
together, and so thank God

00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:44.450
for that 16 year-old girl, she gave
me my pants, she said ma come on,

00:31:44.450 --> 00:31:46.780
here are your pants,
come on, you know.

00:31:46.780 --> 00:31:50.360
You know here's your shirt, put
it on you know, here's your hair,

00:31:50.360 --> 00:31:57.510
put it on[laughter],
glad she said that.

00:31:57.510 --> 00:32:04.070
[ Laughter ]

00:32:04.070 --> 00:32:07.630
So I got myself together [laughter]

00:32:07.630 --> 00:32:10.190
and she said here are your
keys mommy, I can't drive

00:32:10.190 --> 00:32:11.490
yet so you have to drive.

00:32:11.490 --> 00:32:17.080
So I'm driving, I'm driving, and
I'm praying, I'm asking God to,

00:32:17.080 --> 00:32:19.080
you know what am I going to see.

00:32:19.080 --> 00:32:20.630
I mean what's she going
to look like?

00:32:20.630 --> 00:32:22.140
What am I going to say?

00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:24.550
What am I going to do?

00:32:24.550 --> 00:32:27.410
And then when, by the time I got

00:32:27.410 --> 00:32:30.660
to the hospital my older daughter
was there, my baby daughter was

00:32:30.660 --> 00:32:32.740
on this side, my older one's on
this side and I'm in the middle

00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:35.340
and we getting ready to
walk through that door.

00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:39.990
And just before I walk to that door
it was as if God just put something

00:32:39.990 --> 00:32:46.050
in my head and he said,
this is going to happen,

00:32:46.050 --> 00:32:49.660
but don't make it bad for her.

00:32:49.660 --> 00:32:52.070
I knew exactly what he
meant, because my mother

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:53.750
and I are very, very close.

00:32:53.750 --> 00:32:57.760
And if I had just done
something like,

00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:01.290
you know I knew would hurt her.

00:33:01.290 --> 00:33:08.600
So I walked in and I said mommy,
I'm here, I'm here with you

00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:14.430 position:56%
and I don't care how long this thing
takes, a day, a minute, an hour,

00:33:14.430 --> 00:33:16.910
a year, I'm not moving, I'm
going to lay down right here,

00:33:16.910 --> 00:33:18.920
right here beside you ma.

00:33:18.920 --> 00:33:20.970
And I asked the nurse, I said could
you please just move her over,

00:33:20.970 --> 00:33:22.680
just a little bit so
I could lay on her.

00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.060
Oh we can't do that [laughter].

00:33:25.060 --> 00:33:31.420
I said well maybe you
can't, but I can [laughter].

00:33:31.420 --> 00:33:36.000
So they moved her over
and I lay down by mommy,

00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.780
I put my leg on her leg,
and I put my arm on her arm.

00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:42.210
And I was going to put my head
on her chest but you know she had

00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:43.530
that respirator thing going.

00:33:43.530 --> 00:33:49.050
And my mind said, if you do that
she won't be able to breathe, so,

00:33:49.050 --> 00:33:52.140
it's funny what your
mind says you know?

00:33:52.140 --> 00:33:55.850
And so I got a pillow, they
gave me a pillow and I lay down,

00:33:55.850 --> 00:33:57.610
and I was just lying
there, and it was very,

00:33:57.610 --> 00:33:59.690
very peaceful in that room.

00:33:59.690 --> 00:34:03.520
Mommy was very, very peaceful,
it was as if she was okay,

00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:05.620
she was okay with everything.

00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:10.080
And, I laid down there and
I saw a clock on the wall

00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:16.570
and the clock said,
2:30, and everything was

00:34:16.570 --> 00:34:19.470
so quiet, and I fell asleep.

00:34:19.470 --> 00:34:25.650
I fell asleep in my dying
mother's arms, and when I woke

00:34:25.650 --> 00:34:29.770
up it was 4:30, and I panicked.

00:34:29.770 --> 00:34:33.150
I'm like, and I'm looking
over to see what,

00:34:33.150 --> 00:34:37.630
and mommy is still looking
around, still peaceful,

00:34:37.630 --> 00:34:40.260
still looking around,
and I said thank you God.

00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.170
I didn't miss it, I
didn't miss my mother.

00:34:44.170 --> 00:34:48.260
And then the pastor came
in, the priest came in

00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:51.530
and gave her her rights,
she's Catholic.

00:34:51.530 --> 00:34:55.370
And, my older daughter came in the
room and my baby daughter came back

00:34:55.370 --> 00:34:58.500
in the room because they were
in the other room sleeping.

00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:07.530
And so, she said mommy,
her eyes don't look right.

00:35:07.530 --> 00:35:12.860
And I knew and I said well, okay,
okay show her the picture of Jesus.

00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:16.310
So she showed her the picture
of Jesus, and she said mommy,

00:35:16.310 --> 00:35:18.740
mmm she's not looking at that.

00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:20.770
I don't know, I said well
show her the picture of Mary,

00:35:20.770 --> 00:35:22.540
because I know she loves Mary.

00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:25.970
So she showed the picture of Mary
and she said, she said mommy,

00:35:25.970 --> 00:35:28.450
her eyes don't look
right, she's not looking.

00:35:28.450 --> 00:35:31.280 position:56%
She's not looking, she's looking
like through the paper or something.

00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.610
And I went around to the side where
mommy was and I looked in her eyes

00:35:35.610 --> 00:35:38.170
and she was looking
around, and looking around.

00:35:38.170 --> 00:35:41.900
And it was as if she was
looking in amazement,

00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:46.490
and I said Dior [phonetic] I think
she's looking at the real thing.

00:35:46.490 --> 00:35:52.070
And at that moment, I could see
the eyes going a little darker,

00:35:52.070 --> 00:35:56.360
a little brown, and little like red
blood shots were coming and I was

00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.530
like I can't believe I
am looking in the eyes

00:35:59.530 --> 00:36:01.610
of death, I can't believe this.

00:36:01.610 --> 00:36:03.440
I couldn't believe it.

00:36:03.440 --> 00:36:08.360
And I knew someone said start
talking, and I said ma, ma,

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:13.620
I love you mommy, I love you, I
love you, I love you, I love you,

00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:16.380
I love you, I love you, I love you.

00:36:16.380 --> 00:36:19.690
I love you, I love you, I love
you, I love you, I love you.

00:36:19.690 --> 00:36:25.040
And I said I know you love me
too, I said but well had fun,

00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:28.980
we had fun ma, and
we had a good time.

00:36:28.980 --> 00:36:37.310
But it's not over yet,
then she left.

00:36:37.310 --> 00:36:42.690
Then they escorted me out because
they had code blue taking her back

00:36:42.690 --> 00:36:45.220
and they asked me do
we bring her back?

00:36:45.220 --> 00:36:50.410
Yes, bring my mother back,
yes, so they brought her back

00:36:50.410 --> 00:36:57.040
and by this time, my daughter had
called my brother who is a pastor.

00:36:57.040 --> 00:37:00.580
And they said to me, we got
your mother back I said,

00:37:00.580 --> 00:37:01.880
you got her back, okay.

00:37:01.880 --> 00:37:06.920
And he told me Bern,
Bern, you know you got

00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:10.090
to let her go, you
got to let her go.

00:37:10.090 --> 00:37:13.510
It hurts to do that, I said
oh no, no it doesn't hurt.

00:37:13.510 --> 00:37:18.430
So then she said, and then, then
I said to my brother I said Kyle,

00:37:18.430 --> 00:37:20.630
I said something very
weird happened.

00:37:20.630 --> 00:37:23.910
I said when I was laying there
with mommy, I said I fell asleep

00:37:23.910 --> 00:37:27.320
in her arms for 2 hours, I said
how could I have done that?

00:37:27.320 --> 00:37:30.620
He said because it wasn't for you.

00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:32.670
It was for her.

00:37:32.670 --> 00:37:37.590
And she knew that if I could
fall asleep, I would be okay,

00:37:37.590 --> 00:37:41.470
that was God telling
her, Bern will be okay,

00:37:41.470 --> 00:37:44.230 position:56%
because she always worried about me.

00:37:44.230 --> 00:37:47.690
You know the others would be
fine she said but me [laughter].

00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:54.570
You know so, the nurse came back
in and said, you know, I said no,

00:37:54.570 --> 00:37:56.490
no, it's okay let her go.

00:37:56.490 --> 00:37:59.670
And so they said you
can see her if you want,

00:37:59.670 --> 00:38:01.500
come back in you can
see her if you want.

00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:07.820
And I'm so scary, I'm like no, I
said to my baby daughter who's 16,

00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:10.220
she said I'll go in mommy.

00:38:10.220 --> 00:38:14.760
I'll look at her, if she looks
okay I'll let you know, if not,

00:38:14.760 --> 00:38:16.280
you don't have to come in.

00:38:16.280 --> 00:38:19.540
So she went into the room and she
looked at her, she said mommy,

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:21.480
she looks like she's sleeping.

00:38:21.480 --> 00:38:27.420
So I went in the room, and I looked
around at her and we all know

00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.830
that the hearing is the last to go.

00:38:29.830 --> 00:38:35.130
So for about a half an hour
you know they can, hear.

00:38:35.130 --> 00:38:41.050 position:56%
So I saw a little tear like in her
eye, and her mouth was a little open

00:38:41.050 --> 00:38:43.700
from the trach being in there.

00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:46.130
And said mommy, I'm going
to close your mouth,

00:38:46.130 --> 00:38:50.960
I'm going to close your eye,
and I'm going to wash your face

00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:54.270
for the last time, and I did that.

00:38:54.270 --> 00:38:58.150
I put her music on, it was
the most peaceful night,

00:38:58.150 --> 00:39:00.620
it was incredibly peaceful.

00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:05.120
I understood it, it did
not feel like a death,

00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:08.330
it felt she just transitioned.

00:39:08.330 --> 00:39:12.380
Because I always felt her
with me, it was incredible.

00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:16.580
I told her she was beautiful,
I let her speak to my brother,

00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.870
I let her speak to
one of my friends,

00:39:18.870 --> 00:39:22.220
I mean I let them speak
to her [laughter].

00:39:22.220 --> 00:39:28.980
And, I put her music on, and then
of course you know how pastors are,

00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:33.680
they're like that, in a minute
they were there to take my mom.

00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:40.150 position:56%
I'm like wait a minute, they got the
black bag you know, wait a minute.

00:39:40.150 --> 00:39:42.540
I said no, I can't see this.

00:39:42.540 --> 00:39:47.260
So my baby, daughter again, said
mommy I'll stay with her, you go.

00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:49.970
So I left and she stayed
with her all the way

00:39:49.970 --> 00:39:51.600
down until they put
her in the truck.

00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:56.690 position:56%
So that was an incredible,
incredible night, and I had to write

00:39:56.690 --> 00:39:59.830
about that night, and I had
to write about the story

00:39:59.830 --> 00:40:02.900
and the reason why is
because when I said it's not

00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:06.300
over yet, it isn't over yet.

00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:12.140 position:56%
The fight to fight against this
Alzheimer's disease is not over yet.

00:40:12.140 --> 00:40:17.920
And it was given to me to fight
because I feel that I have

00:40:17.920 --> 00:40:23.260
to take this face that my mother
gave me, to put to the face

00:40:23.260 --> 00:40:30.560
of Alzheimer's and fight so that
her death wouldn't be in vain.

00:40:30.560 --> 00:40:34.510
And that's how I felt about that.

00:40:34.510 --> 00:40:46.790
[ Applause ]

00:40:46.790 --> 00:40:49.510
&gt;&gt; Let's give her another
round of applause.

00:40:49.510 --> 00:40:55.140
[ Applause ]

00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:58.510 position:56%
We would just like to say that our
Thelma is still beautiful [laughter]

00:40:58.510 --> 00:40:59.810
and fine [laughter].

00:40:59.810 --> 00:41:09.000
At this time we'll have a reading
from her book by Iris Taylor.

00:41:18.070 --> 00:41:19.380
&gt;&gt; Iris Taylor: This is a passage

00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:24.000
from her book entitled,
the Last Night.

00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.460
&gt;&gt; Iris Taylor: Oooh.

00:41:30.460 --> 00:41:36.300
This is the before.

00:41:36.300 --> 00:41:39.460
Mom had made it to
her 80th birthday,

00:41:39.460 --> 00:41:42.220
even though she had
been battling illness

00:41:42.220 --> 00:41:44.390
that threatened to take her life.

00:41:44.390 --> 00:41:49.610 position:56%
She was in critical condition with a
temporary tracheal tube in her mouth

00:41:49.610 --> 00:41:54.060
and down her throat, but that
didn't stop us for celebrating,

00:41:54.060 --> 00:41:58.150
not only her 80 years on
this earth, but my appearance

00:41:58.150 --> 00:42:01.850
on the television show
The View, that morning.

00:42:01.850 --> 00:42:08.530 position:56%
From the day my book Situations 101,
Relationships, The Good, The Bad,

00:42:08.530 --> 00:42:11.210
and The Ugly came out, she told me

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:14.410
that she wanted to
see me on the show.

00:42:14.410 --> 00:42:20.100
Her wish came true on her birthday,
Friday, September 30th, 2011,

00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:24.560
my appearance was like a
birthday present to her.

00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:31.020
There I was, on TV with Jimmie, JJ
Walker, walking about Good Times

00:42:31.020 --> 00:42:32.560
and my relationship book.

00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:40.170 position:56%
I bought mommy a dozen balloons with
one huge balloon that said, mom,

00:42:40.170 --> 00:42:44.320
I love you, so happy 80th birthday.

00:42:44.320 --> 00:42:48.860
I held mom's hand and
we played music,

00:42:48.860 --> 00:42:54.700
I know she enjoyed me being there
because when I said, mom I'm here,

00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:58.340
she showed me excitement
and opened her eyes.

00:42:58.340 --> 00:43:03.910
I was happy and felt a sense
of accomplishment but fear

00:43:03.910 --> 00:43:08.000
and anguish had that
grip on my heart.

00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:13.860
But I never let my mom know the
pain that I was enduring, the pain

00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:20.510
and the fear that became my
constant companion, thank you.

00:43:20.510 --> 00:43:25.650
[ Applause ]

00:43:25.650 --> 00:43:26.950
&gt;&gt; Thank you, Iris.

00:43:26.950 --> 00:43:29.800
At this time we will have
questions come from you all.

00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:32.140
If anybody would have a question
you like for Bern Nadette,

00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:37.100
would you stand up and
stat your question.

00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:39.150
Anybody? Okay.

00:43:39.150 --> 00:43:41.170
&gt;&gt; How you doing?

00:43:41.170 --> 00:43:43.400
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Fine.

00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:46.910
&gt;&gt; Out of your 3 books it
seems like this is the most,

00:43:46.910 --> 00:43:48.680
it's very personal to you.

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:50.570
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
Which one, this?

00:43:50.570 --> 00:43:51.870
&gt;&gt; The one, yes, this one here.

00:43:51.870 --> 00:43:53.170
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
That one there.

00:43:53.170 --> 00:43:54.470
&gt;&gt; Yeah, that's very personal.

00:43:54.470 --> 00:43:55.770
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Yeah.

00:43:55.770 --> 00:43:58.900
&gt;&gt; Is there a book that you
consider your favorite out of the 3

00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:02.160
or is it just the fact that
each one has their own identity?

00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:04.420
I know my favorite's the
one just for Men [laughter].

00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.310
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
The poetry one [laughter].

00:44:07.310 --> 00:44:11.840
You can order it on my website.

00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:13.140
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:14.440
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
ThelmaGoodtimes.com.

00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:15.740
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:44:15.740 --> 00:44:18.290 position:56%
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: But that was
a nice book, that book of poetry,

00:44:18.290 --> 00:44:19.650
I really enjoyed writing that one.

00:44:19.650 --> 00:44:23.760
This one became very dear to
me because this was the one

00:44:23.760 --> 00:44:25.820
that my mom kind of
helped me with, you know.

00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:28.660
And I would tell her about the
relationships and everything,

00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:33.030
and you know, stuff,
we would go through.

00:44:33.030 --> 00:44:37.460
The other one, called Finances,
Situations 101, Finances, The Good,

00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.680
The Bad, and The Ugly you can
also get that on my website,

00:44:40.680 --> 00:44:44.770
was the second book that I wrote,
coming out of this one because,

00:44:44.770 --> 00:44:48.360
touring this book, realized
that in relationships,

00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:51.760
a lot of relationships
break up because of money,

00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:53.860
that's one of the biggest things.

00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:56.370
Because we don't even
have a relationship

00:44:56.370 --> 00:44:58.920
with our own money, first of all.

00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:01.580
So when we're sharing it
with someone else, you know,

00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:03.440
get pretty rough you
know [laughter].

00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:04.740
So.

00:45:04.740 --> 00:45:06.980
&gt;&gt; You don't want to share it.

00:45:06.980 --> 00:45:08.790
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Yeah,
you know because some people want

00:45:08.790 --> 00:45:10.260
to share, some people
don't want to share.

00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:13.510
You know some people are
spenders, some people are, savers.

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:15.460
You know you marry a
spender, you're a saver,

00:45:15.460 --> 00:45:17.220
you know tug of war [laughter].

00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:19.700
You know things like that, so we
had fun writing the second book,

00:45:19.700 --> 00:45:21.760
but the third book,
that one right there,

00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:25.670
I had to show who my parents were.

00:45:25.670 --> 00:45:28.580
I had to show what they did
in the world because they did

00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:31.180
so much, they sacrificed so much.

00:45:31.180 --> 00:45:35.260
My mother sacrificed so much,
and to never be known for that

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:40.030
or to know that, you know you did
so much and no one knows your name,

00:45:40.030 --> 00:45:41.340
you know, things like that.

00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:43.250
So I said I want to
honor her for that.

00:45:43.250 --> 00:45:44.750
I'm going to honor my dad for that.

00:45:44.750 --> 00:45:48.330
And you know where I came from you
know, and that all, you don't have

00:45:48.330 --> 00:45:50.730
to always, you know look at
a person because they come

00:45:50.730 --> 00:45:55.130
from a certain part of the
world and down them or,

00:45:55.130 --> 00:45:58.080
you know disrespect them,
or anything like that.

00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:02.920 position:56%
Because we all, you know, come from
different places and we all can grow

00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.920
with love, understanding,
we all can make it.

00:46:09.010 --> 00:46:14.240
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette, we've watched your
show over the years, and Good Times

00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:18.880
and the scenes of a lot of
the show were every intense.

00:46:18.880 --> 00:46:23.180
One of my favorite episodes
was with Debbie Allen

00:46:23.180 --> 00:46:26.910
when she played the heroin addict
who was about marry JJ [laughter].

00:46:26.910 --> 00:46:32.760
Do you have a favorite
Good Times episode

00:46:32.760 --> 00:46:34.680
that you enjoyed working with?

00:46:34.680 --> 00:46:39.840
And a lot of the characters are
very well known actors today,

00:46:39.840 --> 00:46:41.710
so everybody got a star.

00:46:41.710 --> 00:46:44.700
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Yes,
they did, thank you for that.

00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.000
Well I have a few.

00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:50.240
I particularly like
the African prince

00:46:50.240 --> 00:46:51.540 position:56%
because that was my show [laughter].

00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:56.410
And they gave me a
two parter [laughter].

00:46:57.600 --> 00:46:59.650
And then also the wedding.

00:46:59.650 --> 00:47:00.950
&gt;&gt; Oh yeah.

00:47:00.950 --> 00:47:02.570
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Yeah,
and then one of my, yep,

00:47:02.570 --> 00:47:05.940
and one of my very favorite
ones, was the one that,

00:47:05.940 --> 00:47:09.970
when Penny was smoking and she
put that, yeah, Janet Jackson.

00:47:09.970 --> 00:47:12.130
And she put the cigarette
underneath the couch

00:47:12.130 --> 00:47:14.430
and nobody knew who
did that [laughter].

00:47:14.430 --> 00:47:16.810
And I got a chance to play like 3

00:47:16.810 --> 00:47:19.990
or 4 different characters
that Thelma is.

00:47:19.990 --> 00:47:22.960
You know like that, I became
a witch, JJ's witch, remember?

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:26.900
You know, and stuff like
that, so that was a lot

00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:29.250
of fun, I enjoyed that one, yes.

00:47:32.390 --> 00:47:38.220
&gt;&gt; Yes, this past Saturday I didn't
even know you played [inaudible]

00:47:38.220 --> 00:47:39.520
in Love Boat.

00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:40.820
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Yeah.

00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.370
&gt;&gt; I didn't know you played

00:47:42.370 --> 00:47:44.200
and I saw you [laughter]
and it [inaudible].

00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:46.270
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
Clifton Davis, uh huh,

00:47:46.270 --> 00:47:47.570
yeah, yeah, yup, yeah, yeah.

00:47:47.570 --> 00:47:48.870
&gt;&gt; I enjoyed that episode.

00:47:48.870 --> 00:47:50.810
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Oh,
thank you very much [laughter].

00:47:50.810 --> 00:47:54.510
I had just played, yes.

00:47:54.510 --> 00:47:58.040
[ Inaudible ]

00:47:58.040 --> 00:48:01.320
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Well we
had that last month, in February,

00:48:01.320 --> 00:48:06.560
it only lasted for a month and they
told us to bid high, so we did.

00:48:06.560 --> 00:48:10.640
We said we're trying to raise a
million, and that didn't happen.

00:48:10.640 --> 00:48:14.360
So, but that is because
Kick Starter,

00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:18.300
Kick Starter wasn't quite
the platform for Good Times.

00:48:18.300 --> 00:48:20.690
Because not a lot of
people knew about it,

00:48:20.690 --> 00:48:23.740
and then they couldn't find
us when they did get there.

00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:27.270
So, that didn't happen but
we have private investors,

00:48:27.270 --> 00:48:31.510
so the movie still might happen.

00:48:31.510 --> 00:48:35.070
[ Applause ]

00:48:35.070 --> 00:48:36.590
&gt;&gt; Next question, mmm hmm.

00:48:36.590 --> 00:48:37.890
Go ahead.

00:48:37.890 --> 00:48:41.420
&gt;&gt; Okay. I'm just curious, I
look at a lot of the reruns

00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:46.020
and I often wonder whatever
happened to those Ernie Barnes,

00:48:46.020 --> 00:48:49.920
the artwork on that show,
the Ernie Barnes originals.

00:48:49.920 --> 00:48:53.610
[Inaudible] ever give
them to you guys?

00:48:53.610 --> 00:48:57.260
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Oh
no [laughter] no, no, no.

00:48:57.260 --> 00:49:02.220
No, no Ernie was on scene and
those belonged to Ernie Barnes.

00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:03.520
&gt;&gt; Right.

00:49:03.520 --> 00:49:04.820
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: And
now they belong to his wife

00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:06.120
because he passed away
a few years ago.

00:49:06.120 --> 00:49:07.420
&gt;&gt; Yeah.

00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:08.720
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis: Mmm hmm.

00:49:08.720 --> 00:49:10.020
&gt;&gt; Okay.

00:49:10.020 --> 00:49:11.320
&gt;&gt; Bern Nadette Stanis:
I wish he had [laughter].

00:49:11.320 --> 00:49:13.120
&gt;&gt; Thank you.
