00:00:00.247 --> 00:00:02.887
- [Instructor] Consider
the density curve below

00:00:02.887 --> 00:00:05.080
and this density curve doesn't look like

00:00:05.080 --> 00:00:06.547
the ones we typically see

00:00:06.547 --> 00:00:08.133
that are a little bit curvier,

00:00:08.133 --> 00:00:09.549
but this is a little easier for us

00:00:09.549 --> 00:00:13.033
to work with and figure out areas.

00:00:13.033 --> 00:00:15.754
So they ask us to find the percent

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:18.411
of the area under the density curve

00:00:18.411 --> 00:00:21.559
where x is more than two.

00:00:21.559 --> 00:00:25.726
So what area represents
when x is more than two?

00:00:27.005 --> 00:00:29.353
This is when x is equal to two.

00:00:29.353 --> 00:00:32.763
So they're talking about
this area right over here.

00:00:32.763 --> 00:00:34.626
And so we need to figure out the percent

00:00:34.626 --> 00:00:36.979
of the total area under the curve

00:00:36.979 --> 00:00:41.031
that this blue area actually represents.

00:00:41.031 --> 00:00:45.170
So first let's find the total
area under the density curve.

00:00:45.170 --> 00:00:47.325
The density only has area,

00:00:47.325 --> 00:00:48.993
the density curve only has area

00:00:48.993 --> 00:00:51.265
from x equals one to x equals three.

00:00:51.265 --> 00:00:54.148
So it does amount to finding the area

00:00:54.148 --> 00:00:56.101
of this larger trapezoid.

00:00:56.101 --> 00:00:59.835
Let me highlight this trapezoid in red.

00:00:59.835 --> 00:01:02.335
So we want to find the area of

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:06.393
this trapezoid right over here.

00:01:08.118 --> 00:01:11.486
And then that should be equal to one

00:01:11.486 --> 00:01:13.231
because all density curves have

00:01:13.231 --> 00:01:16.392
an area of one under the total curve.

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.719
So let's first verify that.

00:01:18.719 --> 00:01:21.070
There's a couple of
ways to think about it.

00:01:21.070 --> 00:01:23.485
We could split it up into two shapes

00:01:23.485 --> 00:01:25.026
or you could just use the formula

00:01:25.026 --> 00:01:27.870
for an area of a trapezoid.

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:31.040
In fact let's use the formula
for an area of a trapezoid.

00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:33.637
The formula for an area of a trapezoid

00:01:33.637 --> 00:01:36.033
is you would take the average of,

00:01:36.033 --> 00:01:38.793
you would take the average of this length.

00:01:38.793 --> 00:01:40.971
Let me do that in another color.

00:01:40.971 --> 00:01:43.981
This length and this length

00:01:43.981 --> 00:01:47.843
and then multiply that times the base.

00:01:47.843 --> 00:01:50.159
So the average of this
length and this length,

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.550
let's see this is 0.25.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:53.383
0.25

00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:56.502
plus this height,

00:01:56.502 --> 00:01:57.335
0.75,

00:01:59.286 --> 00:02:00.870
divided by two.

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.994
So that's the average of those two sides

00:02:03.994 --> 00:02:05.244
times the base,

00:02:06.513 --> 00:02:10.166
times this right over here which is two.

00:02:10.166 --> 00:02:12.999
And so this is going to
give us as it should have,

00:02:12.999 --> 00:02:16.740
0.25 plus 0.75 which is equal to one.

00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:19.586
So the area under the
entire density curve is one

00:02:19.586 --> 00:02:24.049
which we need to be true for
this to be a density curve.

00:02:24.049 --> 00:02:26.766
Now let's think about what
percentage of that area

00:02:26.766 --> 00:02:29.524
is represented in blue right over here.

00:02:29.524 --> 00:02:31.473
Well we could do the same thing.

00:02:31.473 --> 00:02:33.666
We could say all right,
this is a trapezoid.

00:02:33.666 --> 00:02:37.809
We want to take the average of this side

00:02:37.809 --> 00:02:42.109
and this side and multiply
it times the base.

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:44.192
So this side is 0.5 high.

00:02:45.492 --> 00:02:46.325
0.5

00:02:47.242 --> 00:02:48.075
plus 0.75,

00:02:49.949 --> 00:02:50.782
0.75 high,

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:55.511
and we're going to take
the average of that

00:02:55.511 --> 00:02:58.640
divided by two times the base.

00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:00.708
Well the base going from two to three

00:03:00.708 --> 00:03:02.696
is only equal to,

00:03:02.696 --> 00:03:03.981
is equal to one.

00:03:03.981 --> 00:03:05.584
So times one.

00:03:05.584 --> 00:03:09.232
And so this is going to give us 1.25,

00:03:09.232 --> 00:03:10.065
1.25

00:03:11.692 --> 00:03:12.525
over two.

00:03:13.646 --> 00:03:16.485
And what is that going to be equal to?

00:03:16.485 --> 00:03:20.652
Well that would be the same
thing as zero point what?

00:03:21.934 --> 00:03:23.267
Let's see 0.625.

00:03:26.221 --> 00:03:27.349
Did I do that right, Yep.

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:30.543
If I multiply two times
this, I would get 1.25.

00:03:30.543 --> 00:03:34.000
So the percent of the area
under the density curve

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.207
where x is more than two,

00:03:36.207 --> 00:03:39.041
this is the decimal expression of it.

00:03:39.041 --> 00:03:40.748
If we wanted to write it as a percent,

00:03:40.748 --> 00:03:42.581
it would Be 62.5%

00:03:45.418 --> 00:03:47.501
Let's do another example.

00:03:49.930 --> 00:03:51.839
Consider the density curve below.

00:03:51.839 --> 00:03:53.589
All right we have another one of these

00:03:53.589 --> 00:03:55.825
somewhat angular density curves.

00:03:55.825 --> 00:03:58.749
Find the percent of the
area under the density curve

00:03:58.749 --> 00:04:01.832
where x is more than three.

00:04:01.832 --> 00:04:03.419
So we're talking about, let's see,

00:04:03.419 --> 00:04:04.599
this is where x is equal to three,

00:04:04.599 --> 00:04:06.143
x is more than three,

00:04:06.143 --> 00:04:10.275
we're talking about this
entire area right over here.

00:04:10.275 --> 00:04:13.041
Well this is actually
somewhat straightforward

00:04:13.041 --> 00:04:14.992
because if we're saying the area

00:04:14.992 --> 00:04:16.084
where x is more than three,

00:04:16.084 --> 00:04:19.089
that's the entire area
under the density curve.

00:04:19.089 --> 00:04:21.807
And the entire area
under any density curve

00:04:21.807 --> 00:04:23.513
needs to be equal to one.

00:04:23.513 --> 00:04:24.599
Or you could say find the percent

00:04:24.599 --> 00:04:25.655
of the area under the density curve.

00:04:25.655 --> 00:04:28.049
Well the whole density curve

00:04:28.049 --> 00:04:30.532
is where x is more than three.

00:04:30.532 --> 00:04:34.672
So 100%, we don't even have
to go through the trouble

00:04:34.672 --> 00:04:38.172
of trying to directly calculate the area.
