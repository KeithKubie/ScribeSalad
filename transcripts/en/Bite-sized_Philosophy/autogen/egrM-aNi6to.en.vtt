okay well so so that's another issue in

00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:04.500
okay well so so that's another issue in
 

00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:05.960
okay well so so that's another issue in
some sense that seems to make the

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:05.970
some sense that seems to make the
 

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:07.940
some sense that seems to make the
postmodernist critique even more correct

00:00:07.940 --> 00:00:07.950
postmodernist critique even more correct
 

00:00:07.950 --> 00:00:09.230
postmodernist critique even more correct
how in the world you're going to extract

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:09.240
how in the world you're going to extract
 

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.089
how in the world you're going to extract
out a canonical interpretation of

00:00:11.089 --> 00:00:11.099
out a canonical interpretation of
 

00:00:11.099 --> 00:00:13.129
out a canonical interpretation of
something like that it's like it's not

00:00:13.129 --> 00:00:13.139
something like that it's like it's not
 

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:16.070
something like that it's like it's not
possible but here's the issue as far as

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.080
possible but here's the issue as far as
 

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.070
possible but here's the issue as far as
I can tell the interpret so the post

00:00:19.070 --> 00:00:19.080
I can tell the interpret so the post
 

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:20.900
I can tell the interpret so the post
modernists extended that critique to the

00:00:20.900 --> 00:00:20.910
modernists extended that critique to the
 

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:22.460
modernists extended that critique to the
world they said look while a text is

00:00:22.460 --> 00:00:22.470
world they said look while a text is
 

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:24.500
world they said look while a text is
complicated enough you can't extract out

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:24.510
complicated enough you can't extract out
 

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.420
complicated enough you can't extract out
a canonical interpretation what about

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:26.430
a canonical interpretation what about
 

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.609
a canonical interpretation what about
the world the world's way more

00:00:28.609 --> 00:00:28.619
the world the world's way more
 

00:00:28.619 --> 00:00:30.410
the world the world's way more
complicated than a text and so there's

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:30.420
complicated than a text and so there's
 

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.269
complicated than a text and so there's
an infinite number of ways that you can

00:00:32.269 --> 00:00:32.279
an infinite number of ways that you can
 

00:00:32.279 --> 00:00:33.950
an infinite number of ways that you can
look at the world and so how do we know

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:33.960
look at the world and so how do we know
 

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:35.900
look at the world and so how do we know
that any one way is better than any

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:35.910
that any one way is better than any
 

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:40.430
that any one way is better than any
other way that's a good question now the

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:40.440
other way that's a good question now the
 

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.069
other way that's a good question now the
postmodern answer was we can't and

00:00:43.069 --> 00:00:43.079
postmodern answer was we can't and
 

00:00:43.079 --> 00:00:44.959
postmodern answer was we can't and
that's not a good answer because you

00:00:44.959 --> 00:00:44.969
that's not a good answer because you
 

00:00:44.969 --> 00:00:46.549
that's not a good answer because you
drown in chaos under those circumstances

00:00:46.549 --> 00:00:46.559
drown in chaos under those circumstances
 

00:00:46.559 --> 00:00:48.889
drown in chaos under those circumstances
right you can't make sense of anything

00:00:48.889 --> 00:00:48.899
right you can't make sense of anything
 

00:00:48.899 --> 00:00:53.420
right you can't make sense of anything
and that's not good because it's not

00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:53.430
and that's not good because it's not
 

00:00:53.430 --> 00:00:55.670
and that's not good because it's not
neutral to not make sense of things

00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:55.680
neutral to not make sense of things
 

00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:59.389
neutral to not make sense of things
it's very anxiety-provoking it's very

00:00:59.389 --> 00:00:59.399
it's very anxiety-provoking it's very
 

00:00:59.399 --> 00:01:01.069
it's very anxiety-provoking it's very
depressing because if things are so

00:01:01.069 --> 00:01:01.079
depressing because if things are so
 

00:01:01.079 --> 00:01:02.750
depressing because if things are so
chaotic that you can't get a handle on

00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:02.760
chaotic that you can't get a handle on
 

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:05.000

preparation mode and your heart rate
 

00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:08.719
preparation mode and your heart rate
goes up and your immune system stops

working and like you burn yourself out
 

00:01:10.799 --> 00:01:12.469
working and like you burn yourself out
you AIDS rapidly because you're

00:01:12.469 --> 00:01:12.479
you AIDS rapidly because you're
 

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:15.109
you AIDS rapidly because you're
surrounded by nothing you can control

00:01:15.109 --> 00:01:15.119
surrounded by nothing you can control

surrounded by nothing you can control
varying that's an existential crisis

00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:17.670
varying that's an existential crisis
 

00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:19.310
varying that's an existential crisis
right it's anxiety provoking and

00:01:19.310 --> 00:01:19.320
right it's anxiety provoking and
 

00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:21.920
right it's anxiety provoking and
depressing very hard on people and even

depressing very hard on people and even
 

00:01:21.930 --> 00:01:24.170
depressing very hard on people and even
more than that it turns out that the way

00:01:24.170 --> 00:01:24.180
more than that it turns out that the way
 

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:25.450
more than that it turns out that the way
that we're constructed

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:25.460
that we're constructed
 

00:01:25.460 --> 00:01:27.109
that we're constructed
neurophysiological E is that we don't

00:01:27.109 --> 00:01:27.119
neurophysiological E is that we don't
 

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:29.539
neurophysiological E is that we don't
experience any positive emotion unless

00:01:29.539 --> 00:01:29.549
experience any positive emotion unless
 

00:01:29.549 --> 00:01:32.810
experience any positive emotion unless
we have a name and we can see ourselves

precisely attaining the aim that makes

00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:38.490
precisely attaining the aim that makes
 

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.999
precisely attaining the aim that makes
us happy as you all know if you've ever

00:01:40.999 --> 00:01:41.009
us happy as you all know if you've ever
 

00:01:41.009 --> 00:01:42.859
us happy as you all know if you've ever
attained anything because soon as you

00:01:42.859 --> 00:01:42.869
attained anything because soon as you
 

00:01:42.869 --> 00:01:44.719
attained anything because soon as you
attain it then the whole little game

00:01:44.719 --> 00:01:44.729
attain it then the whole little game
 

00:01:44.729 --> 00:01:46.219
attain it then the whole little game
ends and you have to come up with

00:01:46.219 --> 00:01:46.229
ends and you have to come up with
 

00:01:46.229 --> 00:01:48.950
ends and you have to come up with
another game right so it's it's civis

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:48.960
another game right so it's it's civis
 

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:51.740
another game right so it's it's civis
and now that's okay but but it does show

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:51.750
and now that's okay but but it does show
 

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:53.569
and now that's okay but but it does show
that the attainment can't be the thing

00:01:53.569 --> 00:01:53.579
that the attainment can't be the thing
 

00:01:53.579 --> 00:01:55.460
that the attainment can't be the thing
that drives you because it collapses the

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:55.470
that drives you because it collapses the
 

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:56.810
that drives you because it collapses the
game that's what happens when you

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:56.820
game that's what happens when you
 

00:01:56.820 --> 00:01:58.310
game that's what happens when you
graduate from university it's like

00:01:58.310 --> 00:01:58.320
graduate from university it's like
 

00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.709
graduate from university it's like
you're king of the mountain for one day

00:02:00.709 --> 00:02:00.719
you're king of the mountain for one day
 

00:02:00.719 --> 00:02:03.160
you're king of the mountain for one day
and then you're like surf fest at

00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:03.170
and then you're like surf fest at
 

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:05.630
and then you're like surf fest at
Starbucks for the next five years and

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:05.640
Starbucks for the next five years and
 

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.880
Starbucks for the next five years and
home so

00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:06.890
home so
 

00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:10.510
home so
yeah so what happens is let that human

00:02:10.510 --> 00:02:10.520
yeah so what happens is let that human
 

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.130
yeah so what happens is let that human
beings are weird creatures because we're

00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:12.140
beings are weird creatures because we're
 

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.400
beings are weird creatures because we're
much more activated by having an aim and

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:15.410
much more activated by having an aim and
 

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:17.050
much more activated by having an aim and
moving towards it than we are by

00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:17.060
moving towards it than we are by
 

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:18.460
moving towards it than we are by
attainment and what that means is you

00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:18.470
attainment and what that means is you
 

00:02:18.470 --> 00:02:20.680
attainment and what that means is you
have to have a name and that means you

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:20.690
have to have a name and that means you
 

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.360
have to have a name and that means you
have to have an interpretation and it

00:02:22.360 --> 00:02:22.370
have to have an interpretation and it
 

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:24.460
have to have an interpretation and it
also means that the nobler they aim

00:02:24.460 --> 00:02:24.470
also means that the nobler they aim
 

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:26.470
also means that the nobler they aim
that's one way of thinking about it the

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:26.480
that's one way of thinking about it the
 

00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:28.690
that's one way of thinking about it the
better your life and that's a really

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:28.700
better your life and that's a really
 

00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.220
better your life and that's a really
interesting thing to know because you

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:30.230
interesting thing to know because you
 

00:02:30.230 --> 00:02:31.720
interesting thing to know because you
know you've heard ever since you were

00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:31.730
know you've heard ever since you were
 

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:33.280
know you've heard ever since you were
tiny that you should act like a good

00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:33.290
tiny that you should act like a good
 

00:02:33.290 --> 00:02:35.560
tiny that you should act like a good
person you shouldn't live for example

00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:35.570
person you shouldn't live for example
 

00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:37.210
person you shouldn't live for example
and you might think well why the hell

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:37.220
and you might think well why the hell
 

00:02:37.220 --> 00:02:39.490
and you might think well why the hell
should I act like a good person and why

00:02:39.490 --> 00:02:39.500
should I act like a good person and why
 

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.740
should I act like a good person and why
not live I mean even a three-year-old

00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:41.750
not live I mean even a three-year-old
 

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.570
not live I mean even a three-year-old
can ask that question because smart

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:43.580
can ask that question because smart
 

00:02:43.580 --> 00:02:45.550
can ask that question because smart
smart kids learn to lie earlier by the

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:45.560
smart kids learn to lie earlier by the
 

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.150
smart kids learn to lie earlier by the
way and they think well why not twist

00:02:49.150 --> 00:02:49.160
way and they think well why not twist
 

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:51.460
way and they think well why not twist
the fabric of reality so that it serves

00:02:51.460 --> 00:02:51.470
the fabric of reality so that it serves
 

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:53.979
the fabric of reality so that it serves
your specific short-term needs I mean

00:02:53.979 --> 00:02:53.989
your specific short-term needs I mean
 

00:02:53.989 --> 00:02:55.870
your specific short-term needs I mean
that's a great question why not do that

00:02:55.870 --> 00:02:55.880
that's a great question why not do that
 

00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.180
that's a great question why not do that
why act morally if you can get away with

00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:58.190
why act morally if you can get away with
 

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:00.430
why act morally if you can get away with
something and it brings you closer to

00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:00.440
something and it brings you closer to
 

00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:02.650
something and it brings you closer to
something you want well why not do it

00:03:02.650 --> 00:03:02.660
something you want well why not do it
 

00:03:02.660 --> 00:03:04.780
something you want well why not do it
these are good questions it's not

00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:04.790
these are good questions it's not
 

00:03:04.790 --> 00:03:07.810
these are good questions it's not
self-evident well it seems to me tied in

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:07.820
self-evident well it seems to me tied in
 

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.970
self-evident well it seems to me tied in
with what I just mentioned it's like you

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:09.980
with what I just mentioned it's like you
 

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.009
with what I just mentioned it's like you
destabilize yourself and things become

00:03:12.009 --> 00:03:12.019
destabilize yourself and things become
 

00:03:12.019 --> 00:03:14.350
destabilize yourself and things become
chaotic that's not good and if you don't

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:14.360
chaotic that's not good and if you don't
 

00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:16.390
chaotic that's not good and if you don't
have a noble aim then you have nothing

00:03:16.390 --> 00:03:16.400
have a noble aim then you have nothing
 

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:21.039
have a noble aim then you have nothing
but but shallow trivial pleasures and

but but shallow trivial pleasures and
 

00:03:21.049 --> 00:03:23.949
but but shallow trivial pleasures and
