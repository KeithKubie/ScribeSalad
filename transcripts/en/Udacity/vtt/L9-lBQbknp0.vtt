00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:03.280
Thinks Mora. Let's get back to our scatter plot of

00:00:03.280 --> 00:00:06.580
friend count versus age. It might be appealing to further

00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:10.500
summarize the relationship of age and friend count. Rather than

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.300
having the four extra layers of geom line, we could try

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:15.870
to summarize the strength of this relationship in a single

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.220
number. Often, analyst will use a correlation coefficient to summarize this,

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:22.540
now, if you're not familiar with correlation, you should review

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.960
the links in the instructor notes. We've even included some practice

00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:29.910
from Stat 95, that's our statistics course. We're going to

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.980
use the Pearson product moment correlation, noted with a

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:36.260
lower case r, to measure the linear relationship between

00:00:36.260 --> 00:00:38.100
age and friend count What I want you to

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.265
do is to look up the documentation for the

00:00:40.265 --> 00:00:43.960
core.test function. Figure out how to find Pearson's r

00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:47.330
using any two variables. What's the correlation between age

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.630
and friend count? Round your answer to three decimal places.
