00:00:06.817 --> 00:00:09.773
Many people in the United States
and Latin America

00:00:09.773 --> 00:00:14.540
have grown up celebrating the anniversary
of Christopher Columbus's voyage,

00:00:14.540 --> 00:00:18.336
but was he an intrepid explorer
who brought two worlds together

00:00:18.336 --> 00:00:22.611
or a ruthless exploiter who brought
colonialism and slavery?

00:00:22.611 --> 00:00:26.252
And did he even discover America at all?

00:00:26.252 --> 00:00:32.472
It's time to put Columbus on the stand
in History vs. Christopher Columbus.

00:00:32.472 --> 00:00:34.123
"Order, order in the court.

00:00:34.123 --> 00:00:36.614
Wait, am I even supposed to 
be at work today?"

00:00:36.614 --> 00:00:37.989
<i>Cough</i>

00:00:37.989 --> 00:00:39.380
"Yes, your Honor.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:43.910
From 1792, Columbus Day was celebrated
in many parts of the United States

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.245
on October 12th,
the actual anniversary date.

00:00:47.245 --> 00:00:51.170
But although it was declared
an official holiday in 1934,

00:00:51.170 --> 00:00:54.783
individual states aren't required
to observe it.

00:00:54.783 --> 00:00:57.394
Only 23 states close public services,

00:00:57.394 --> 00:01:01.135
and more states are moving away
from it completely."

00:01:01.135 --> 00:01:02.075
<i>Cough</i>

00:01:02.075 --> 00:01:03.329
"What a pity.

00:01:03.329 --> 00:01:06.233
In the 70s, we even moved it to the
second Monday in October

00:01:06.233 --> 00:01:08.875
so people could get a nice 
three-day weekend,

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:12.008
but I guess you folks
just hate celebrations."

00:01:12.008 --> 00:01:14.207
"Uh, what are we celebrating again?"

00:01:14.207 --> 00:01:17.104
"Come on, Your Honor, 
we all learned it in school.

00:01:17.104 --> 00:01:20.635
Christopher Columbus convinced the King
of Spain to send him on a mission

00:01:20.635 --> 00:01:23.147
to find a better trade route to India,

00:01:23.147 --> 00:01:27.540
not by going East over land
but sailing West around the globe.

00:01:27.540 --> 00:01:31.269
Everyone said it was crazy because they
still thought the world was flat,

00:01:31.269 --> 00:01:32.968
but he knew better.

00:01:32.968 --> 00:01:36.308
And when in 1492 he
sailed the ocean blue,

00:01:36.308 --> 00:01:38.423
he found something better
than India:

00:01:38.423 --> 00:01:40.593
a whole new continent."

00:01:40.593 --> 00:01:42.200
"What rubbish.

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:46.794
First of all, educated people knew
the world was round since Aristotle.

00:01:46.794 --> 00:01:49.814
Secondly, Columbus didn't 
discover anything.

00:01:49.814 --> 00:01:52.867
There were already people living here
for millennia.

00:01:52.867 --> 00:01:55.272
And he wasn't even 
the first European to visit.

00:01:55.272 --> 00:01:59.561
The Norse had settled Newfoundland
almost 500 years before."

00:01:59.561 --> 00:02:02.737
"You don't say, so how come we're not
all wearing those cow helmets?"

00:02:02.737 --> 00:02:05.385
"Actually, they didn't really 
wear those either."

00:02:05.385 --> 00:02:06.978
<i>Cough</i>

00:02:06.978 --> 00:02:09.818
"Who cares what some Vikings did
way back when?

00:02:09.818 --> 00:02:13.268
Those settlements didn't last,
but Columbus's did.

00:02:13.268 --> 00:02:16.411
And the news he brought back to Europe
spread far and wide,

00:02:16.411 --> 00:02:20.442
inspiring all the explorers and settlers
who came after.

00:02:20.442 --> 00:02:23.541
Without him, none of us 
would be here today."

00:02:23.541 --> 00:02:29.067
"And because of him, millions of
Native Americans aren't here today.

00:02:29.067 --> 00:02:31.837
Do you know what Columbus did
in the colonies he founded?

00:02:31.837 --> 00:02:34.822
He took the very first 
natives he met prisoner

00:02:34.822 --> 00:02:40.571
and wrote in his journal about how easily
he could conquer and enslave all of them."

00:02:40.571 --> 00:02:44.514
"Oh, come on. Everyone was fighting each
other back then.

00:02:44.514 --> 00:02:46.448
Didn't the natives even tell Columbus

00:02:46.448 --> 00:02:50.062
about other tribes raiding
and taking captives?"

00:02:50.062 --> 00:02:52.837
"Yes, but tribal warfare 
was sporadic and limited.

00:02:52.837 --> 00:02:56.241
It certainly didn't wipe out 90%
of the population."

00:02:56.241 --> 00:02:59.949
"Hmm. Why is celebrating this Columbus
so important to you, anyway?"

00:02:59.949 --> 00:03:03.042
"Your Honor, Columbus's voyage 
was an inspiration

00:03:03.042 --> 00:03:08.288
to struggling people all across Europe,
symbolizing freedom and new beginnings.

00:03:08.288 --> 00:03:11.450
And his discovery gave our grandparents
and great-grandparents

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:15.967
the chance to come here and build better
lives for their children.

00:03:15.967 --> 00:03:19.346
Don't we deserve a hero to remind
everyone that our country

00:03:19.346 --> 00:03:22.925
was build on the struggles of immigrants?"

00:03:22.925 --> 00:03:24.997
"And what about the struggles 
of Native Americans

00:03:24.997 --> 00:03:28.372
who were nearly wiped out 
and forced into reservations

00:03:28.372 --> 00:03:32.685
and whose descendants still suffer from
poverty and discrimination?

00:03:32.685 --> 00:03:36.520
How can you make a hero out of a man
who caused so much suffering?"

00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:41.290
"That's history. You can't judge a guy
in the 15th century by modern standards.

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:43.075
People back then even thought spreading

00:03:43.075 --> 00:03:47.391
Christianity and civilization 
across the world was a moral duty."

00:03:47.391 --> 00:03:50.262
"Actually, he was pretty bad,
even by old standards.

00:03:50.262 --> 00:03:53.430
While governing Hispaniola, he tortured
and mutilated

00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.333
natives who didn't bring him enough gold

00:03:56.333 --> 00:03:59.895
and sold girls as young as nine into 
sexual slavery,

00:03:59.895 --> 00:04:02.951
and he was brutal even to the other 
colonists he ruled,

00:04:02.951 --> 00:04:07.059
to the point that he was removed 
from power and thrown in jail.

00:04:07.059 --> 00:04:09.313
When the missionary, 
Bartolomé de las Casas,

00:04:09.313 --> 00:04:11.097
visited the island, he wrote,

00:04:11.097 --> 00:04:16.837
'From 1494 to 1508,
over 3,000,000 people had perished

00:04:16.837 --> 00:04:23.447
from war, slavery and the mines. Who in 
future generations will believe this?'"

00:04:23.447 --> 00:04:26.086
"Well, I'm not sure I believe 
those numbers."

00:04:26.086 --> 00:04:29.398
"Say, aren't there other ways the holiday
is celebrated?"

00:04:29.398 --> 00:04:31.278
"In some Latin American countries,

00:04:31.278 --> 00:04:35.730
they celebrate the same date under
different names, such as Día de la Raza.

00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.437
In these places, it's more a celebration
of the native and mixed cultures

00:04:39.437 --> 00:04:41.949
that survived through the colonial period.

00:04:41.949 --> 00:04:44.583
Some places in the U.S. have also
renamed the holiday,

00:04:44.583 --> 00:04:47.724
as Native American Day
or Indigenous People's Day

00:04:47.724 --> 00:04:50.746
and changed the celebrations accordingly."

00:04:50.746 --> 00:04:53.440
"So, why not just change the name
if it's such a problem?"

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.511
"Because it's tradition.

00:04:55.511 --> 00:04:59.004
Ordinary people need their heroes
and their founding myths.

00:04:59.004 --> 00:05:02.548
Can't we just keep celebrating
the way we've been doing for a century,

00:05:02.548 --> 00:05:05.573
without having to delve into all this
serious research?

00:05:05.573 --> 00:05:08.910
It's not like anyone is actually 
celebrating genocide."

00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:12.349
"Traditions change, and the way 
we choose to keep them alive

00:05:12.349 --> 00:05:14.860
says a lot about our values."

00:05:14.860 --> 00:05:21.790
"Well, it looks like giving tired judges a
day off isn't one of those values, anyway."

00:05:21.790 --> 00:05:24.649
Traditions and holidays 
are important to all cultures,

00:05:24.649 --> 00:05:28.518
but a hero in one era
may become a villain in the next

00:05:28.518 --> 00:05:32.529
as our historical knowledge expands
and our values evolve.

00:05:32.529 --> 00:05:35.364
And deciding what these 
traditions should mean today

00:05:35.364 --> 00:05:39.482
is a major part 
of putting history on trial.
