00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:08.140
Hi, I'm Craig, and this is Crash Course Government
and Politics. And today, we're gonna get personal.

00:00:08.140 --> 00:00:12.400
Not personal in the sense that I'm gonna tell you
I'm a bed wetter cause I'm not...gonna tell you that.

00:00:12.400 --> 00:00:15.650
We're gonna talk about people's personal political
views and where they come from. This is what

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:18.570
political scientists sometimes call Political
Socialization.

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:21.800
But before we get into the forces that help
create our political outlooks, we should probably

00:00:21.800 --> 00:00:24.340
define what political ideologies look like
in America.

00:00:24.340 --> 00:00:33.120
[Theme Music]

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.520
In America, there are a number of ways
people characterize themselves politically.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:40.920
Typically, they identify with a political party, although
as we'll see when we talk more about parties,

00:00:40.930 --> 00:00:42.489
this has become less likely over time.

00:00:42.489 --> 00:00:45.980
And although there's a lot of overlap between
political party and political ideology, there's

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:48.460
not 100% correspondence between the two.

00:00:48.460 --> 00:00:53.660
But there is 100% overlap between my fist
and this eagle's beak! Politics.

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:57.039
So, now I should probably say what I mean
by political ideology. Basically, I'm talking

00:00:57.039 --> 00:01:02.530
about whether you identify as liberal or conservative
or libertarian or socialist or anarchist or

00:01:02.530 --> 00:01:09.210
nihilist or craigist - people who just love
me. I'm one of those.

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:12.159
You're probably familiar with the idea that
liberals are on the left, and conservatives

00:01:12.159 --> 00:01:16.659
are on the right. And this can be a helpful shorthand,
but what political views do these terms represent?

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:21.340
Let's go to the Clone Zone! What? The Clone
Zone - it's right here now? I'll just...I'll

00:01:21.340 --> 00:01:23.950
leave then. This way? I'll go this way.

00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:28.300
Taking a cue from anti-federalists, American
conservatives believe that a large government poses

00:01:28.300 --> 00:01:33.640
a threat to individual liberty, and we prefer our national 
government to be as small as possible. (Scoffs)

00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:36.799
We have this in common with libertarians.
There are some basic functions like national

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.959
defense that government can best take care
of. But especially since the New Deal, our

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.479
government has taken on too much. What government
we need is best handled by states and localities.

00:01:45.479 --> 00:01:48.930
For the most part, American conservatives
believe in the free market and that it will

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:53.030
provide the greatest economic opportunity
and benefit to the greatest number of people.

00:01:53.030 --> 00:01:57.220
American conservatives usually support a strong
defense. This is one place where we generally don't

00:01:57.220 --> 00:02:02.000
think spending should be cut. Most other programs,
the things that fall under discretionary spending,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.360
can and should be left up to the private sector. And 
this will allow the government to reduce its spending.

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:11.020
Lower spending, in turn, will mean lower taxes.
Ahh, delicious lower taxes.

00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:14.420
This means that we don't like flag burning,
and we favor prayer in schools because these

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:17.090
reflect traditional religious and patriotic
values.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.230
Just like the eagle. I love the eagle. You're
my friend. (Kisses eagle)

00:02:21.230 --> 00:02:24.850
Many conservatives, as strong adherents
to religious faiths, are against abortion.

00:02:24.850 --> 00:02:29.460
But I'd say there's a greater diversity in conservative
views on social issues than on economic ones.

00:02:29.470 --> 00:02:33.349
The social sphere is where we differ significantly
from our libertarian friends who don't see

00:02:33.349 --> 00:02:37.170
any role for government in people's personal
lives. This means that libertarians often

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.220
support things like marijuana legalization that
more traditional conservatives do not support.

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:44.980
If there's one value that American conservatives
privilege above others, it's liberty. America

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:49.680
is a country of freedom, and in most cases, government
is more of a threat to liberty than a protector of it.

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.040
And I'm out. (Kisses hand and touches eagle's
head)

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:55.540
Not bad conservative clone.
But bad, here's why.

00:02:55.540 --> 00:02:59.200
Sometimes liberals in the U.S. are called
New Deal Liberals because the policies that we

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.900
support grew out of the New Deal. And lately, a number
of us are trying to re-brand ourselves as progressives.

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:07.860
Although this is a little tricky given that, historically,
progressives and liberals aren't the same thing.

00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:11.800
In general, American liberals believe that
government can help solve problems, and a

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:16.690
bigger government, like a glorious soaring
eagle can solve bigger problems and more of them.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.020
We support government intervention in the
economy, both in the form of regulations and

00:03:22.030 --> 00:03:26.180
higher taxes, especially when that intervention
benefits historically marginalized groups

00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.840
like minorities, women, and the poor.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:31.459
We like to the government step in on behalf
of consumers and to protect the environment

00:03:31.459 --> 00:03:34.640
because in general, we don't trust that the
free market will be fair to everyone.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.800
We know that protection of the environment, aiding
the poor, and expanding civil liberties all cost money,

00:03:38.800 --> 00:03:43.180
so we usually favor a progressive tax system
with higher taxes on the wealthy and corporations.

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:47.100
Although not all American liberals are anti-business,
as a rule we don't have a lot of faith that big

00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:51.620
businesses have the average American's best interest
at heart, and so we prefer to see them regulated.

00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:55.040
Although we still see national defense as
important, most American liberals feel that

00:03:55.049 --> 00:03:58.560
the country spends more than enough on the
military and that the defense budget should

00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:01.099
be cut, leaving more money for necessary social
programs.

00:04:01.099 --> 00:04:04.879
In the debate over guns or butter, we like
butter. Although we're also fine with the

00:04:04.879 --> 00:04:06.530
government telling us not to eat so much of it.

00:04:06.530 --> 00:04:10.659
If conservatives value liberty, we liberals
cherish equality as their primary political

00:04:10.659 --> 00:04:15.539
virtue, and we see government as a necessary agent in
promoting equality. (Kisses hand and pats eagle's head)

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:17.079
We're equals, me and that eagle.

00:04:17.079 --> 00:04:21.090
Thanks clones. So, for the most part, this
is what most American liberals and conservatives

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:24.699
believe, and these are the basic foundations
upon which they build their political opinions.

00:04:24.699 --> 00:04:27.150
But where do they come from? (Punches eagle
and eagle tumbles to the floor)

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:30.620
Political scientists sometimes refer to the
process by which individuals establish their

00:04:30.620 --> 00:04:34.720
personal political ideologies as political
socialization. And they have identified four

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:37.160
main agents that contribute to our political
identities.

00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.440
Let's go to the Thought Bubble!

00:04:38.449 --> 00:04:42.220
The first and most important source of our
politics is family. This makes a lot of sense

00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:46.310
since kids either want to emulate their parents
or reject their ideas. And parents are usually

00:04:46.310 --> 00:04:48.890
the first people that express political opinions
to kids.

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:52.580
As I suggested, family can influence your
political outlook in negative and positive

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:56.840
ways. If you respect your parents and admire
them, it's likely you will adopt their political ideology.

00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:00.160
On the other hand, adopting an opposing political
view can be a form of rebellion.

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.990
Still, for the most part, liberal parents
breed liberal children, and conservative parents

00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:05.830
create new generations of conservatives.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:09.580
The second major influence on political ideology
is social groups, which in this case, refer

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:13.490
to one's race, gender, religion, or ethnicity.
Obviously, these are generalizations, but

00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:16.639
certain groups tend to fall predictably into
liberal or conservative camps.

00:05:16.639 --> 00:05:20.520
African Americans and Jewish people are among
the most liberal Americans while white Catholics

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:24.660
tend to be conservative. Latinos are an interesting
case because many identify as Catholic, but

00:05:24.660 --> 00:05:26.080
they tend to be more liberal politically.

00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:29.780
One of the reasons that many use to explain
why African Americans and Latinos tend to be

00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:34.639
liberals is that these groups are disproportionately poor
and receive a significant share of government benefits.

00:05:34.639 --> 00:05:39.039
To this way of thinking, economic self interest
is a prime determiner of where one stands

00:05:39.039 --> 00:05:42.590
politically, and it also explains why white
conservatives, especially those who are wealthy,

00:05:42.590 --> 00:05:45.639
favor policies of lower taxes and less government
intervention.

00:05:45.639 --> 00:05:49.030
One problem with this purely self interested
view of political ideology though is that

00:05:49.030 --> 00:05:52.930
there is a large number of low income, low
wealth white voters who also do or would gain

00:05:52.930 --> 00:05:55.460
from more government benefits. But they tend
to be conservative.

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.260
In other words, be careful when you try to define
a person's politics by looking at their bank account.

00:05:59.260 --> 00:06:03.440
Gender also tends to be statistically significant
in terms of political ideology. The gender

00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:07.360
gap refers to the fact that women tend to be
more liberal overall than men. This is especially

00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:11.680
true on the issue of national defense where they
tend to favor spending reductions rather than increases.

00:06:11.680 --> 00:06:15.800
Thanks Thought Bubble. The third agent of
political socialization in the U.S. is education,

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.100
namely the primary and secondary school system.

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:21.410
This is the most formal way that our political
views are shaped since almost all American

00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:25.500
students take at least one year of American
history, and many states require courses in civics.

00:06:25.500 --> 00:06:29.220
In these courses, students learn about political
values like liberty and equality and may come

00:06:29.220 --> 00:06:31.620
to align themselves with a liberal or conservative
view.

00:06:31.620 --> 00:06:35.780
And maybe you're watching me in one of these
classes right now...

00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.280
Conservatives tend to think that American
schools and textbooks skew towards a liberal

00:06:39.289 --> 00:06:43.330
outlook, but this might be because most public
school teachers are members of unions, and

00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.030
teachers' union membership correlates highly
with a liberal viewpoint.

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:49.360
Whether or not most teachers and textbooks
are liberal, it's a bit of a leap to assume

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:52.400
that most students will automatically adopt
the ideology of their teachers.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:56.240
Education does relate to political ideology
in at least one measurable way though.

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:59.979
In that the higher the level of education one
attains, the more likely one is to profess

00:06:59.979 --> 00:07:02.630
liberal views on issues such as women's rights
or abortion.

00:07:02.630 --> 00:07:06.530
On the other hand, higher education levels also
correlate with more conservative views on issues

00:07:06.530 --> 00:07:10.819
like government support of national health insurance or
affirmative action programs to help African Americans.

00:07:10.819 --> 00:07:14.460
So, as with many things we look at, things
aren't so clear cut, and it's important to

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:16.930
have some kind of data to back up our generalizations.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:20.800
One final agent of political socialization
are the political conditions one lives through.

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.380
Example - if you grew up during the Great
Depression and saw FDR's New Deal programs

00:07:24.380 --> 00:07:28.780
benefit you and your family, it's likely that you'd
develop and maintain pro-government, liberal views.

00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:31.960
If you came of age during the Reagan era,
when popular politicians were singing the

00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:35.509
praises of self-reliance and calling government
the problem rather than the solution, it's

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.669
likely that you'd develop conservative political
views.

00:07:37.669 --> 00:07:40.980
It remains to be seen whether people who form
their political identities during the Great

00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:45.240
Recession will be liberal or conservative.
But don't worry - pollsters are busy trying to figure it out.

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:48.580
So there you have a very broad outline of
what the words conservative and liberal mean

00:07:48.580 --> 00:07:52.180
in American politics and some of the factors
that turn people into liberals or conservatives.

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:55.220
More than probably anything I've said in this
series, these are generalizations that you

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.889
need to look at critically. This doesn't mean
that if you find someone or if you are someone

00:07:58.889 --> 00:08:03.330
who doesn't fit either description 100%, that
we're completely wrong, only that political

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:05.250
ideologies are complex and change over time.

00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:08.180
But we need to understand the outlines of
these generalities because they get used all

00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:12.840
the time in our discussions of American politics. In fact,
it would be hard to talk about politics without them.

00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:14.400
