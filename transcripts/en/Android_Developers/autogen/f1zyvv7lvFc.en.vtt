alrighty so now that we know how to

00:00:08.030 --> 00:00:08.040
alrighty so now that we know how to
 

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.220
alrighty so now that we know how to
submit scores to leaderboards let's go

00:00:10.220 --> 00:00:10.230
submit scores to leaderboards let's go
 

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:12.530
submit scores to leaderboards let's go
through the process of removing these

00:00:12.530 --> 00:00:12.540
through the process of removing these
 

00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:14.780
through the process of removing these
hard-coded strings I'm going to do

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:14.790
hard-coded strings I'm going to do
 

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:16.220
hard-coded strings I'm going to do
something a little different than the

00:00:16.220 --> 00:00:16.230
something a little different than the
 

00:00:16.230 --> 00:00:17.870
something a little different than the
achievement manager you'll remember in

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
achievement manager you'll remember in
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.460
achievement manager you'll remember in
the achievement manager we created a new

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:19.470
the achievement manager we created a new
 

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:22.490
the achievement manager we created a new
enum for each of the achievements now I

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:22.500
enum for each of the achievements now I
 

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.810
enum for each of the achievements now I
could do the same thing for our leader

00:00:23.810 --> 00:00:23.820
could do the same thing for our leader
 

00:00:23.820 --> 00:00:25.670
could do the same thing for our leader
boards but the thing is where we

00:00:25.670 --> 00:00:25.680
boards but the thing is where we
 

00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:27.710
boards but the thing is where we
basically already have any num set up

00:00:27.710 --> 00:00:27.720
basically already have any num set up
 

00:00:27.720 --> 00:00:29.990
basically already have any num set up
for this if you look in our enemies H

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.000
for this if you look in our enemies H
 

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.670
for this if you look in our enemies H
file we have this difficulty level 1 and

00:00:33.670 --> 00:00:33.680
file we have this difficulty level 1 and
 

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:36.080
file we have this difficulty level 1 and
since our leader boards correspond

00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:36.090
since our leader boards correspond
 

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.720
since our leader boards correspond
exactly to difficulty levels I'm just

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:38.730
exactly to difficulty levels I'm just
 

00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:42.139
exactly to difficulty levels I'm just
going to go ahead and reuse this I'm

00:00:42.139 --> 00:00:42.149
going to go ahead and reuse this I'm
 

00:00:42.149 --> 00:00:44.240
going to go ahead and reuse this I'm
going to do so let's see i'm going to

00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:44.250
going to do so let's see i'm going to
 

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.700
going to do so let's see i'm going to
set this to 0 just to kind of ensure

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:46.710
set this to 0 just to kind of ensure
 

00:00:46.710 --> 00:00:48.470
set this to 0 just to kind of ensure
that yes easy really is going to

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:48.480
that yes easy really is going to
 

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:51.350
that yes easy really is going to
correspond to 0 and then in our

00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:51.360
correspond to 0 and then in our
 

00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.930
correspond to 0 and then in our
leaderboard manager i'm going to create

00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:53.940
leaderboard manager i'm going to create
 

00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:59.630
leaderboard manager i'm going to create
a new method called submit score for

00:00:59.630 --> 00:00:59.640
a new method called submit score for
 

00:00:59.640 --> 00:01:04.549
a new method called submit score for
difficulty level and that's right I

00:01:04.549 --> 00:01:04.559
difficulty level and that's right I
 

00:01:04.559 --> 00:01:15.560
difficulty level and that's right I
gotta go up here and import my Keenum's

00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:15.570
 

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.330
difficulty level well xcode why are you

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
difficulty level well xcode why are you
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.180
difficulty level well xcode why are you
giving me there we go all right now to

00:01:23.180 --> 00:01:23.190
giving me there we go all right now to
 

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:26.630
giving me there we go all right now to
implement this I do still need to create

00:01:26.630 --> 00:01:26.640
implement this I do still need to create
 

00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.510
implement this I do still need to create
the array of static strings that lets me

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
the array of static strings that lets me
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.230
the array of static strings that lets me
know what leaderboard corresponds to you

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:33.240
know what leaderboard corresponds to you
 

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.380
know what leaderboard corresponds to you
know each difficulty level so I'm going

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.390
know each difficulty level so I'm going
 

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:41.350
know each difficulty level so I'm going
to do our static and a string Const

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:41.360
to do our static and a string Const
 

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:49.690
to do our static and a string Const
leaderboard IDs and that will equal and

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:49.700
leaderboard IDs and that will equal and
 

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:52.430
leaderboard IDs and that will equal and
now I got to go to my developer console

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:52.440
now I got to go to my developer console
 

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:54.740
now I got to go to my developer console
and make sure I copy and paste these so

00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:54.750
and make sure I copy and paste these so
 

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:59.170
and make sure I copy and paste these so
let's bring that up there you go and

00:01:59.170 --> 00:01:59.180
let's bring that up there you go and
 

00:01:59.180 --> 00:02:06.499
let's bring that up there you go and
copy this one let's copy this one I

00:02:06.499 --> 00:02:06.509
copy this one let's copy this one I
 

00:02:06.509 --> 00:02:08.419
copy this one let's copy this one I
think these are really all the same

00:02:08.419 --> 00:02:08.429
think these are really all the same
 

00:02:08.429 --> 00:02:10.850
think these are really all the same
except for the last letter here but just

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:10.860
except for the last letter here but just
 

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.550
except for the last letter here but just
in case I always like copying and

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:13.560
in case I always like copying and
 

00:02:13.560 --> 00:02:25.120
in case I always like copying and
pasting there we go and can do this and

00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:25.130
pasting there we go and can do this and
 

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:28.130
pasting there we go and can do this and
we convey it a little in a string for

00:02:28.130 --> 00:02:28.140
we convey it a little in a string for
 

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:32.360
we convey it a little in a string for
our leaderboard ID and that equals our

00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:32.370
our leaderboard ID and that equals our
 

00:02:32.370 --> 00:02:38.150
our leaderboard ID and that equals our
leaderboard IDs level and you know

00:02:38.150 --> 00:02:38.160
leaderboard IDs level and you know
 

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.500
leaderboard IDs level and you know
actually you know what I'm just going to

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:39.510
actually you know what I'm just going to
 

00:02:39.510 --> 00:02:41.840
actually you know what I'm just going to
combine these two methods into one so

00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:41.850
combine these two methods into one so
 

00:02:41.850 --> 00:02:43.699
combine these two methods into one so
there we go we get our leaderboard ID by

00:02:43.699 --> 00:02:43.709
there we go we get our leaderboard ID by
 

00:02:43.709 --> 00:02:46.880
there we go we get our leaderboard ID by
looking at our leaderboard IDs array and

00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:46.890
looking at our leaderboard IDs array and
 

00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:48.770
looking at our leaderboard IDs array and
then basically I'm just going to combine

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:48.780
then basically I'm just going to combine
 

00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.380
then basically I'm just going to combine
this with the rest of the submit score

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:51.390
this with the rest of the submit score
 

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.479
this with the rest of the submit score
for leaderboard ID method now I

00:02:53.479 --> 00:02:53.489
for leaderboard ID method now I
 

00:02:53.489 --> 00:02:55.160
for leaderboard ID method now I
basically just need to go back to my dot

00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:55.170
basically just need to go back to my dot
 

00:02:55.170 --> 00:02:58.160
basically just need to go back to my dot
H file and delete this method because we

00:02:58.160 --> 00:02:58.170
H file and delete this method because we
 

00:02:58.170 --> 00:03:01.550
H file and delete this method because we
no longer want to use it and we're

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:01.560
no longer want to use it and we're
 

00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:04.100
no longer want to use it and we're
pretty good so now I can go back to my

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:04.110
pretty good so now I can go back to my
 

00:03:04.110 --> 00:03:07.729
pretty good so now I can go back to my
game model class and replace this method

00:03:07.729 --> 00:03:07.739
game model class and replace this method
 

00:03:07.739 --> 00:03:09.470
game model class and replace this method
where I'm submitting a score to a

00:03:09.470 --> 00:03:09.480
where I'm submitting a score to a
 

00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:11.720
where I'm submitting a score to a
hard-coded leaderboard string to just

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:11.730
hard-coded leaderboard string to just
 

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.120
hard-coded leaderboard string to just
leaderboard manager submit score num

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:14.130
leaderboard manager submit score num
 

00:03:14.130 --> 00:03:17.930
leaderboard manager submit score num
guesses for difficulty level and 0 at

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
guesses for difficulty level and 0 at
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:20.300
guesses for difficulty level and 0 at
this point I realized you know what I'm

00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:20.310
this point I realized you know what I'm
 

00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:22.550
this point I realized you know what I'm
not actually storing the difficulty

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:22.560
not actually storing the difficulty
 

00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.729
not actually storing the difficulty
level anywhere in this class well this

00:03:25.729 --> 00:03:25.739
level anywhere in this class well this
 

00:03:25.739 --> 00:03:27.620
level anywhere in this class well this
is something we can fix with a simple

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:27.630
is something we can fix with a simple
 

00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.450
is something we can fix with a simple
property or

00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:29.460
property or
 

00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:31.280
property or
variable let me just go up here and add

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:31.290
variable let me just go up here and add
 

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:35.330
variable let me just go up here and add
it as a property by the way I often go

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:35.340
it as a property by the way I often go
 

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:36.970
it as a property by the way I often go
back and forth about whether i should be

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:36.980
back and forth about whether i should be
 

00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:39.500
back and forth about whether i should be
storing these these private variables as

00:03:39.500 --> 00:03:39.510
storing these these private variables as
 

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.950
storing these these private variables as
you know little little ants here or as

00:03:42.950 --> 00:03:42.960
you know little little ants here or as
 

00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.560
you know little little ants here or as
actual properties in the class extension

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:45.570
actual properties in the class extension
 

00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:48.530
actual properties in the class extension
I go back and forth I'm not quite sure

00:03:48.530 --> 00:03:48.540
I go back and forth I'm not quite sure
 

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:50.630
I go back and forth I'm not quite sure
if one way is really considered more

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:50.640
if one way is really considered more
 

00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.380
if one way is really considered more
proper than the other but I'm just going

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:54.390
proper than the other but I'm just going
 

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:56.510
proper than the other but I'm just going
to go ahead and do it here I'm going to

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:56.520
to go ahead and do it here I'm going to
 

00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.910
to go ahead and do it here I'm going to
create a little int that is going to

00:03:58.910 --> 00:03:58.920
create a little int that is going to
 

00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:02.630
create a little int that is going to
store our difficulty level so there we

00:04:02.630 --> 00:04:02.640
store our difficulty level so there we
 

00:04:02.640 --> 00:04:07.460
store our difficulty level so there we
go I do know however that since I've

00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:07.470
go I do know however that since I've
 

00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:08.960
go I do know however that since I've
kind of created most of these others as

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:08.970
kind of created most of these others as
 

00:04:08.970 --> 00:04:11.060
kind of created most of these others as
properties I don't know why I'm then

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:11.070
properties I don't know why I'm then
 

00:04:11.070 --> 00:04:13.100
properties I don't know why I'm then
referring to them using their private

00:04:13.100 --> 00:04:13.110
referring to them using their private
 

00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:15.110
referring to them using their private
variable names with this underscore game

00:04:15.110 --> 00:04:15.120
variable names with this underscore game
 

00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:17.330
variable names with this underscore game
X underscore secret number I should

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:17.340
X underscore secret number I should
 

00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:18.830
X underscore secret number I should
probably be using some self dot notation

00:04:18.830 --> 00:04:18.840
probably be using some self dot notation
 

00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.920
probably be using some self dot notation
here sorry about that but in any case I

00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:21.930
here sorry about that but in any case I
 

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.130
here sorry about that but in any case I
guess I'll be consistently incorrect

00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:25.140
guess I'll be consistently incorrect
 

00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.530
guess I'll be consistently incorrect
here and we'll store our difficulty

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:27.540
here and we'll store our difficulty
 

00:04:27.540 --> 00:04:30.710
here and we'll store our difficulty
level has the level that gets passed in

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:30.720
level has the level that gets passed in
 

00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:35.390
level has the level that gets passed in
and now this has been recorded I can now

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:35.400
and now this has been recorded I can now
 

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.140
and now this has been recorded I can now
go back to the bottom here and for

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:42.150
go back to the bottom here and for
 

00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:43.730
go back to the bottom here and for
difficulty level I can now change that

00:04:43.730 --> 00:04:43.740
difficulty level I can now change that
 

00:04:43.740 --> 00:04:47.000
difficulty level I can now change that
to difficulty level property or and
