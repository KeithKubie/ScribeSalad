00:00:07.220 --> 00:00:12.160
In China's Valley of the Kings there stands a tall carved stone

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:20.559
It marks the tomb of a woman who rose from lowly concubine to become emperor of China

00:00:20.869 --> 00:00:23.559
The only woman to dare claim that title

00:00:26.029 --> 00:00:32.499
But China's female Emperor has gone down in history as a controversial and deeply divisive ruler

00:00:35.359 --> 00:00:38.079
To have a woman with such power

00:00:38.659 --> 00:00:41.138
really threatened the establishment

00:00:41.749 --> 00:00:45.879
Not only did Wu Zetian rock the boat in some ways. She overturned it

00:00:46.519 --> 00:00:50.859
It would have been a very dangerous thing to get in the way of Wu Zetian

00:00:54.049 --> 00:01:02.019
Since her death 1,300 years ago wu zetian has been remembered as a callous tyrant who brought calamity to china

00:01:05.320 --> 00:01:07.270
But now

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:12.869
Extraordinary new discoveries are revealing a very different picture of her reign from ancient tombstones

00:01:12.869 --> 00:01:16.679
I've been waiting since this was excavated. I am ecstatic

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:19.049
to Buddhist temples

00:01:19.049 --> 00:01:26.038
I honestly wasn't expecting that that is really exciting seeing this with your eyes is incredible experience

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.009
Lost treasures have even more fantastic than I thought it would be

00:01:32.979 --> 00:01:39.659
Now for the first time experts are discovering how one woman managed to rule all the Imperial China

00:01:42.479 --> 00:01:49.079
And whether Wu Zetian really was an evil dictator or one of the most misunderstood leaders in history

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:19.269
The only female emperor in China's 2,000 years of Imperial history was named Wu Zetian

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.760
move the celestial

00:02:27.020 --> 00:02:33.130
She first entered court in 637 ad as a 13 year old concubine

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.290
Part of the hareem of mistresses serving emperor Taizong of the Tang dynasty

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:47.959
Tang Taizong had more than a hundred concubines by repute. She was beautiful. She was charming. She was entertaining

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:53.030
She also had a real zest for life

00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:56.930
Concubine Wu soon got herself noticed

00:02:57.450 --> 00:02:59.100
When she entered the palace

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:06.769
She quickly gained favour of this emperor and her relationship of become closer and with the rise her of her influence at court

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:08.700
and

00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.859
She proved to be politically very very skilful and she's very shrewd

00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:20.840
When the old Emperor died Wu Zetian became at first concubine to his son Gaozong

00:03:22.849 --> 00:03:26.378
Then in 655 he made her his Empress

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:30.250
But emperor gaozong was a sickly man

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:35.319
And gradually Wu became the real power behind the throne

00:03:36.530 --> 00:03:44.019
Until in 690 with her husband dead Wu Zetian stepped from the shadows and declared herself Emperor

00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:50.530
Yet China's ancient chroniclers were scathing in their accounts of her rise to power

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:56.049
History tells us a really dark and bleak picture about Empress Wu

00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:05.270
One of the most brutal stories we have is that she killed her own child just to frame the previous Empress and

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.580
gain station at court

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.730
We're also told that Wu Zhao had her two

00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:21.140
Rivals legs and arms cut off and then dip them in a vat of wine and let them slowly bleed to death

00:04:23.520 --> 00:04:28.009
So this paints a picture of a devious

00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.030
manipulating

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.290
calculating

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:34.010
self-serving and absolutely ruthless Virago

00:04:34.830 --> 00:04:36.830
hell-bent on power

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:48.070
Even after she claimed the throne we're told Wu Zetian was ruthless in her reign

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:54.690
This is the tomb of Wu Zetian's second son Li Xian. He was a threat to his mother

00:04:55.570 --> 00:04:59.939
Li Xian was accused of treason and he was exiled to the most remote

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.230
corner of the Chinese Empire locked in a room and

00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:08.010
forced to commit suicide by poisoning

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.870
So this is a mother killing her own son so that she can hold on to power

00:05:15.370 --> 00:05:18.090
Wu Zetian led China for nearly 50 years

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:25.750
According to legend she was a tyrant whose reign brought disaster to the Empire

00:05:40.280 --> 00:05:46.449
Now archaeologists run earthing new evidence the challenges this version of Wu's story

00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:56.489
The professor Zhang Jianlin is the world's leading archaeologists to the tang era

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:36.839
Today the city of Xian has grown to encompass old Chang'an, Wu's capital

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:41.190
The population of 12 million Xian is rapidly expanding

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.720
It's also home to professor Zhang's conservation facility

00:06:52.340 --> 00:06:59.619
Historian dr. Harry Rothschild has heard about some intriguing recent finds that date to Wu's rein. Whoa

00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.900
It's amazing seeing all these Tang artifacts

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:09.880
I've been studying Wu Zhao, Wu Zetian for 17 years and finally here

00:07:09.880 --> 00:07:15.360
We are at Ground Zero you can sense her everywhere here in Chang'an

00:07:17.539 --> 00:07:25.029
The figurines show life in Wu's capital the musicians traders and nobles buried with the dead to ensure a comfortable

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:27.229
afterlife

00:07:27.229 --> 00:07:29.709
but there's also something unexpected here a

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.639
first clue to what Wu's China was really like

00:08:21.319 --> 00:08:25.839
So we're looking at an unprecedented boost for the position of women

00:08:25.840 --> 00:08:31.000
you're talking about a female Emperor here after all and and so that

00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:37.419
Translated directly in this sort of greater opportunity and greater freedom for women in the late 7th in early 8th century

00:08:44.410 --> 00:08:47.399
It seems like there may be more to Wu Zetian that meets the eye

00:08:50.050 --> 00:08:52.260
Ancient chroniclers denigrated her reign

00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:59.609
But many recent tomb discoveries like the women in men's clothing hinted a rather different story

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:11.400
Professor Tonia Eckfeld is an expert on Tang era tombs

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.980
She's on her way to see one of the most amazing archaeological finds in all Chinese history

00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:36.129
It's amazing it's even more fantastic than I thought it would be

00:09:38.820 --> 00:09:42.530
This is the fabled Phoenix crown of ancient China a

00:09:43.380 --> 00:09:45.380
long-lost treasure from the Tang era

00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:48.530
written about in ancient texts, but never seen

00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.210
until now

00:09:51.210 --> 00:09:57.439
This priceless headdress is held under lock and key and can only be viewed by special appointment

00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:02.319
Tonia believes that is a vital clue to the truth about Wu Zetian's China

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:06.219
There's an enormous amount to investigate in this piece

00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:12.579
Looking closely the metal work is filigree, and there's a lot of granulation

00:10:14.510 --> 00:10:17.200
Granulation consists of tiny little beads of gold

00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:25.780
The whole crown is like a peacock displaying its tail

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:34.660
There are very very fine flowers made of mother-of-pearl and pearl. There are even fine bunches of grapes made of Chinese glass

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:39.790
So really what we see here is something

00:10:40.430 --> 00:10:42.430
cosmopolitan and something rich

00:10:42.740 --> 00:10:45.010
something fashionable full of

00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.530
luxury items not only in the making of it, but also in the imagery involved

00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:59.739
Professors Jung's team found the Phoenix crown in a grave that was already in exceptional find, a tomb that had never been raided

00:11:02.020 --> 00:11:06.629
Inside was a skeleton and on the skull the beehive hairstyle

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:09.630
studded with jewels

00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:16.080
The skeleton was of a young woman named Li Chui a minor descendant of the Tang royal family

00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:22.050
For 18 months the team carefully picked out every single jewel and stone

00:11:22.480 --> 00:11:26.430
Slowly piecing together the headdress to reveal its true glory

00:11:28.690 --> 00:11:36.240
But when they used x-ray chromatography to discover where the different jewels and stones came from they were in for a surprise

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.299
The headdress has carnelian from Uzbekistan

00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:50.440
2,900 miles to the west of Chang'an, garnet from India 3,000 miles southwest

00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:56.889
Amber from Iran 4,000 miles away and ivory from Sri Lanka

00:11:58.459 --> 00:12:00.459
4500 miles from Wu's capital

00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:06.519
The crown gives us clues about Wu Zetian's society. Life was rich. There's a lot of luxury

00:12:06.519 --> 00:12:08.519
It was a real high point in the arts

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:15.250
What we can see here is the embodiment of all of the wealth and all of the treasure that the Tang court could attract

00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:28.189
Li Chui wasn't even a princess if she was buried wearing this priceless headdress

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:32.660
Clear evidence of the extraordinary wealth of China at the time

00:12:35.340 --> 00:12:38.060
Her tomb holds one final secret

00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.749
She was buried with the Jade silkworm in her hand

00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:48.139
Another clue that reveals Wu's ambitions to make her China the wealthiest empire in the world

00:12:58.320 --> 00:13:05.249
In seventh century China a woman named Wu Zetian rose from lonely concubine to Empress

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:12.520
With her husband, the Emperor's sick. She ruled the Empire in all but name

00:13:15.890 --> 00:13:19.059
Ancient chroniclers dismissed her reign as a time of calamity

00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:26.309
But today's experts think the truth may be very different

00:13:28.890 --> 00:13:33.259
In a tomb 50 miles northwest of wu's capital city, Chang'an

00:13:33.870 --> 00:13:39.380
Tonia Eckfeld is investigating murals that provide strong evidence of Wu's influence and power

00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:45.350
Here we can see a mural of foreign ambassadors coming to court

00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:53.980
Ambassadors came from far and wide in this mural we can see a Mongolian a Korean and a townshend monk

00:13:54.480 --> 00:13:56.480
perhaps from Rome or Syria

00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:02.740
There's a man from Xinjian from Greece and from Persia

00:14:03.959 --> 00:14:08.449
It's interesting because we can see that the The Ambassadors are in

00:14:08.910 --> 00:14:12.770
quite subservient positions their hands are clasped before them and

00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.469
Seem quite in awe of the situation

00:14:18.330 --> 00:14:23.569
The mural suggests that Wu Zetian was a respected international leader of her time

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.709
I think Wu Zetian was a consummate politician

00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:32.029
she saw advantage in the use of

00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:38.959
diplomacy rather than warfare and led the society that was quite open and open to foreigners

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:43.159
Many foreigners at high level beat a path to her door

00:14:50.570 --> 00:14:55.510
Recent research suggests that there were 25,000 foreigners living in Wu's Chang'an

00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:01.630
Many were traders and more than anything, they were after one Chinese product.

00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:15.060
Since the 4th millennium BC China had produced the finest quality silk

00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:21.690
By Wu's era the demand for Chinese silk had made it as valuable as gold

00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:31.349
The ancient trade routes of the Silk Road began in Chang'an spreading east and west linking China to other nations

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:38.429
But by the mid 7th century bandits and robbers threatened to stop trade in its tracks

00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:42.959
new discoveries reveal Wu Zetian's master strain

00:15:43.629 --> 00:15:50.368
She built military outposts far into Central Asia securing safe passage all along the Silk routes

00:15:57.580 --> 00:16:05.309
Harry Rothschild has come to the very start of the Silk Road in Chang'an to find the latest archaeological evidence of trade in Wu's capital

00:16:06.250 --> 00:16:11.489
This is incredible. We've been allowed to come right down here into the Western market

00:16:11.490 --> 00:16:13.649
We're standing right on the edge of the canal

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:21.750
looking right across into this square where you had all of these stalls arrayed where rows of iron mongers and butchers and

00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:23.350
tanner's and

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:29.519
silversmiths, goldsmith's, calligraphy brush salesmen would be arrayed where you could find anything under the Sun

00:16:30.730 --> 00:16:33.269
If you get down closely here you can see

00:16:34.149 --> 00:16:37.199
Ruts that have been left in in the earth

00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:43.829
From the carts that went over this bridge you really feel the ambience of the Western market

00:16:45.910 --> 00:16:51.330
In Wu Zetian's Chang'an, the east and west markets marked the start of the silk road

00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:57.330
In the West market goods from lands to the west of Chang'an were bought and sold

00:17:03.490 --> 00:17:07.950
Silk Road trade not only made Wu's Empire wealthy it brought so many

00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:11.820
foreigners to China that her capital became one of the first truly

00:17:12.310 --> 00:17:18.179
cosmopolitan cities in the world. People from all across the world traveled to China and many chose to stay

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:22.619
And this multicultural influence can still be felt in present day Xi'an

00:17:23.260 --> 00:17:29.160
We are walking along the Huimin street the Chinese Muslims street on the very heart of old

00:17:29.320 --> 00:17:32.740
Tang China and it is bustling it is vibrant. It is full of energy

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.460
As you see by the milling bustle going on behind me now

00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:42.540
I think these are sugared figs or dried figs here

00:17:43.390 --> 00:17:47.220
these came from along the Silk Road from from Persia

00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:51.300
So this is a kind of wheat kernel candy

00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:55.019
and he's pulling this taffy then afterwards they'll take the taffy and they'll

00:17:55.180 --> 00:18:00.090
Roll it out with pumpkin seeds or with sesame seeds and then turn it into this hard candy

00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:04.079
The sesame came from Persia and the Middle East along the Silk Road

00:18:04.300 --> 00:18:10.739
So this is this is sort of the fruit of something that was trafficked thirteen hundred years ago during Wu Zetian's time

00:18:14.010 --> 00:18:16.129
It is good. I think in terms of the

00:18:16.650 --> 00:18:22.249
multiculturalism the vibrance the bustle the energy just the constant commercial buzz

00:18:22.590 --> 00:18:26.090
You have a great sense of what was going on during the time

00:18:32.640 --> 00:18:40.400
By 662 with her husband the Emperor ill Empress Wu Zetian was an effective control of the whole Chinese Empire

00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:44.030
Trade had brought wealth and luxury

00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:50.600
Evident from the valuable artifacts that have been found and Wu wanted to flaunt this to the rest of the world

00:18:54.960 --> 00:19:00.829
To do this she planned the expansion of the Imperial Palace on a scale never seen before

00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:07.910
When archaeologists first uncovered the foundations they were amazed by what they found

00:19:14.610 --> 00:19:20.150
This is one of the huge gated entrances rebuilt to scale on those very foundations

00:19:21.210 --> 00:19:24.890
This is Danfeng Gate the southern gate of Daming palace

00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:29.119
Just looking up at it it conjures a sense of awe

00:19:30.750 --> 00:19:32.340
For me

00:19:32.340 --> 00:19:34.050
It's a statement

00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.250
It provides a sense of Imperial grandeur

00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:42.620
It makes any one sort of standing before the gate feel a sense of their own smallness and insignificance

00:19:44.490 --> 00:19:48.199
Wu Zetian's Daming Palace was the largest in the world

00:19:50.100 --> 00:19:55.579
Completed in just three years the scale of the complex outshone anything anyone had ever seen

00:19:57.660 --> 00:19:59.660
Look at the size of Daming Palace

00:20:00.150 --> 00:20:02.659
This is twice as big as old pompeii

00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:09.860
It's five times bigger than the Forbidden City of the Ming and Qing Dynasty Emperor's it's twenty-two times the size of the Acropolis

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.380
The scope the grand juror. It's it's absolutely staggering.

00:20:16.380 --> 00:20:17.340
You can read about it

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:23.920
but you don't really appreciate that magnitude until you step out on this balcony and you look out at this vista

00:20:25.700 --> 00:20:30.669
There are archery grounds. There are polo grounds, cockfighting arenas,

00:20:31.340 --> 00:20:37.780
places for drama troops to practice and that's just the beginning. There are three or four more palaces beyond that

00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:47.579
Emissaries coming from foreign countries would come in with their jaws dropping with just a sort of starry-eyed

00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:53.729
wonder and they would feel like they were looking at a celestial world a paradise on earth.

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:59.880
I do think that was about imposing her power with the majesty and size of Daming Palace

00:21:01.809 --> 00:21:06.839
But Harry thinks this place is unusual in more than just its extreme size

00:21:07.630 --> 00:21:12.089
Chang'an when it was first designed was the model of perfect Imperial symmetry

00:21:13.419 --> 00:21:21.389
The old Imperial Palace was in the north central position within the Tang capital Chang'an. This new Daming Palace

00:21:22.270 --> 00:21:26.939
was outside of the city walls altogether. It's very unusual to build a palace

00:21:27.460 --> 00:21:30.809
outside of this usual model of imperial symmetry

00:21:31.090 --> 00:21:34.860
there's one good reason for 12 years Wu Zhao had

00:21:35.289 --> 00:21:39.148
languished in the old imperial palace. For her,

00:21:39.149 --> 00:21:46.169
this was a chance to get a new start to distance herself from her lowly and obscure past as a fifth rank talent

00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.440
Here where you have this stunning new imperial grandeur

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:54.820
was an opportunity to sort of reinvent herself

00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:03.729
It's becoming clear that Wu Zetian made China a global superpower

00:22:05.870 --> 00:22:09.790
Contrary to how the legends were written she was at the center of a web of trade

00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:14.650
wealth and political influence that stretched from Japan to the Mediterranean

00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:39.509
In the seventh century Wu Zetian's capital city Chang'an was in a class of its own

00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:44.789
So Chang'an during Wu Zetian's time would have been an absolutely massive city

00:22:45.009 --> 00:22:49.378
There's supposed to be almost a million people living within the city walls and another million outside

00:22:49.659 --> 00:22:52.409
which just outclasses anything else in the world at that time

00:22:58.060 --> 00:23:04.200
Jonathan Dugdale from Birmingham University thinks he knows one reason for Wu Zetian's remarkable success

00:23:05.830 --> 00:23:11.189
She would win the support of the common people through the reinvigorated religion that was sweeping China

00:23:12.220 --> 00:23:13.360
Buddhism

00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:20.250
Wu Zetian realized patronizing Buddhism was a great way to please the people and what better way than building new temples and pagodas

00:23:21.070 --> 00:23:25.740
So one of the main ones she built was this one right behind this the great wild goose pagoda

00:23:30.580 --> 00:23:35.320
The great goose pagoda was originally built in 652

00:23:35.830 --> 00:23:38.639
As someone who studied pagodas for a long time, this is

00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:41.340
particularly awesome

00:23:42.220 --> 00:23:46.139
The pagoda was an important temple housing sacred Buddhist writings

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:51.779
But just 50 years after it was built. It was destroyed in an earthquake

00:23:55.830 --> 00:24:00.019
Wu, who had been brought up in the Buddhist faith spending time in a nunnery,

00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:04.579
decided to rebuild the pagoda but on a much bigger scale

00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:10.009
Jonathan suspects that this new building was a record breaker and

00:24:10.350 --> 00:24:14.389
that Wu surpassed herself in her desire to make her mark in her people's faith

00:24:15.570 --> 00:24:17.570
And he thinks he can prove it.

00:24:19.649 --> 00:24:24.138
I would really like to find out how tall this building was when Wu Zetian rebuilt it

00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:28.939
Because it'd be really interesting if she's decided to build it significantly bigger for a reason

00:24:33.690 --> 00:24:41.090
But first he has a problem to solve. Wu Zetian's pagoda was partially damaged by a second earthquake

00:24:45.629 --> 00:24:47.719
The top three floors toppled

00:24:48.749 --> 00:24:54.199
So Jonathan has to work out how high her structure would have been with the missing floors

00:24:54.869 --> 00:24:56.070
onwards and upwards

00:24:56.070 --> 00:25:01.159
One two Okay that's 40 steps for that one and that put us on the fourth floor now

00:25:01.649 --> 00:25:04.219
35, 36, 37, 38

00:25:04.950 --> 00:25:06.929
One two three...

00:25:06.929 --> 00:25:09.079
He's found a pattern in the number of steps

00:25:09.779 --> 00:25:15.888
Previous floors we've gone from 43 to 40 to 38 37. So for the next floor is either 37 or 36

00:25:15.889 --> 00:25:17.889
We should make an accurate calculation

00:25:18.240 --> 00:25:22.000
34, 35, 36, 37

00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.620
This is good, we're still decreasing so this is good we might be able to do something last one

00:25:29.090 --> 00:25:31.090
Let's do the math people

00:25:33.680 --> 00:25:36.850
By working out the pattern and height of the steps per story

00:25:37.970 --> 00:25:39.650
136

00:25:39.650 --> 00:25:46.959
Jonathan calculates with the missing three floors the true height of wu's pagoda was close to a staggering 300 feet high

00:25:48.270 --> 00:25:52.940
Which would have made it not only the tallest brick pagoda in Asia

00:25:53.310 --> 00:25:56.149
But possibly one of the tallest buildings in the world at that time

00:26:06.230 --> 00:26:10.630
It would have been like nothing else that anyone had seen before in the cityscape

00:26:10.630 --> 00:26:16.749
now it still looks impressive. But in those days it would have soared above absolutely everything else in the sea

00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.400
Who built this record-breaking structure as a statement targeted directly at her people

00:26:25.910 --> 00:26:27.160
There's so many different things

00:26:27.160 --> 00:26:31.660
she stands to gain from building a massive pagoda in such a visual space like this

00:26:31.730 --> 00:26:39.189
The majority of the population of Chang'an at this time are Buddhists and they will see that she's supporting Buddhism. She's supporting their religion

00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:53.499
Wu Zetian ordered the building of new Buddhist temples in every town in her empire

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.160
creating allies among the common people of China

00:26:58.340 --> 00:27:00.340
And she didn't stop there

00:27:04.580 --> 00:27:09.929
250 miles east of Chang'an in Henan province are the Longmen Grottoes Caves

00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.829
Historian Lou Young thinks there may be key to understanding Wu's power

00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:25.129
This is a sacred place for Buddhist. The religion and pilgrims have have been coming here for centuries

00:27:25.830 --> 00:27:30.590
But I have been told there is a connection that link and pursue directly to their faith

00:27:35.830 --> 00:27:40.890
Members of the elite paid vast sums to carve small caves into this sacred hillside

00:27:44.830 --> 00:27:50.010
There are over 1,400 housing over 100,000 Buddha figures

00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:53.699
The smallest is just an inch tall

00:27:56.070 --> 00:27:58.070
The biggest is an imposing

00:27:58.770 --> 00:28:00.570
57 feet high

00:28:00.570 --> 00:28:03.049
commissioned by Wu Zetian herself and

00:28:03.690 --> 00:28:05.690
It has a story to tell

00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.860
Wow, isn't this impressive?

00:28:29.820 --> 00:28:32.760
What a view it is gigantic

00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:41.240
The official name of this Buddha is Vairocana, which is the radiant Buddha of a great Sun

00:28:41.290 --> 00:28:43.859
This is basically a universal Buddha

00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:49.020
Symbolized the the power and indominus of this religion

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:55.819
Wu Zetian wanted to put herself at the heart of buddhism in the eyes of her people

00:28:58.720 --> 00:29:00.570
To do this, it's possible

00:29:00.570 --> 00:29:05.820
she took one audacious step and ordered the statue to be carved in her own image

00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:09.119
The legend says that this statue actually is modeled after her face

00:29:10.750 --> 00:29:14.219
She want to make this a statement of her power

00:29:16.030 --> 00:29:24.030
This will give her more credibility because this is the age of Buddhism and there's a massive follower of this particular religion and by

00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:32.220
creating this temple, she basically put herself on the center stage of of not just religious action, but also the society in general

00:29:36.340 --> 00:29:40.319
You know the seeing this with your own eyes is incredible experience

00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:47.119
This is so impressive to me and I think she got what she wanted

00:29:58.110 --> 00:30:00.990
The longmen grottoes and the great goose pagoda

00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:09.600
suggests that Wu Zetian was a skillful tactician who knew how to use religion to promote her own status and keep her Empire happy

00:30:13.549 --> 00:30:17.679
And up river from the giant buddha the series of very recent

00:30:18.020 --> 00:30:22.059
archaeological discoveries reveal another of the secrets of her success

00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:24.410
Wow

00:30:24.410 --> 00:30:26.410
This is spectacular

00:30:27.410 --> 00:30:29.270
Here in Luoyang

00:30:29.270 --> 00:30:34.640
Professor wangju and his team have been excavating giant granaries designed for storing rice

00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.569
Inscriptions enabled the team to date each granary precisely

00:31:07.940 --> 00:31:12.220
Wu Zetian ordered rice from eastern China to be brought here by canal

00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.730
stockpiled in these vast grain stores then

00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.520
redistributed in times of need

00:31:35.770 --> 00:31:41.069
During the early 7th century China suffered prolonged droughts leading to famines

00:31:41.770 --> 00:31:43.770
But under Wu Zetian,

00:31:43.929 --> 00:31:47.038
improvements to the rice stores design were to prove invaluable

00:32:32.710 --> 00:32:36.360
Wow the massive scale of this granary really testify

00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:44.579
The the power and the capability of Empress Wu's regime and and she is a very capable ruler

00:32:44.770 --> 00:32:47.609
That the grain kept here can last for many years

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:53.880
So this is not just contributed to the stability of her regime but also for the future of tang dynasty as well

00:32:57.660 --> 00:33:04.969
Archeology is revealing that Wu Zetian was an efficient administrator who ensured her people and her soldiers were always fed

00:33:12.770 --> 00:33:19.089
But despite her successes, as a woman she could never rely on the support of the aristocratic establishment

00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:21.880
She needed allies

00:33:23.920 --> 00:33:29.820
So in a radical break with tradition, Wu allowed commoners to join in the administration of her government

00:33:32.880 --> 00:33:39.289
She encouraged women to be entrepreneurs and permitted Chinese women to divorce and marry freely for the first time

00:33:40.230 --> 00:33:47.449
But in a moment of breathtaking audacity, she even appointed a female prime minister by the name of Shangguan Wan'er

00:33:51.559 --> 00:33:57.849
Harry has been told of evidence professor Zhang's team have found in recent excavations in the Prime Minister's tomb

00:33:58.490 --> 00:34:01.929
Suggesting her life had a controversial final chapter

00:34:04.970 --> 00:34:06.379
This is

00:34:06.379 --> 00:34:09.789
Shangguan Wan'er' epitaph I've been waiting since

00:34:10.159 --> 00:34:16.509
September of 2013 when this was excavated for a chance to actually see this in person and it's finally happening today

00:34:16.509 --> 00:34:18.500
So I am ecstatic

00:34:26.720 --> 00:34:29.520
This says she had 47 springs and autumns

00:34:30.060 --> 00:34:32.940
at the time of her death

00:34:37.760 --> 00:34:40.449
But when Zhang's team found the prime minister's tomb

00:34:40.909 --> 00:34:42.909
It had been purposely destroyed

00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:48.900
And this destruction is key to understanding why the bleak picture of Wu Zetian has been passed on through the centuries

00:34:58.300 --> 00:35:04.600
This was thorough, kind of malicious and intentional destruction that had been done to the tomb

00:35:28.299 --> 00:35:34.738
Shangguan Wan'er's tomb had been dismantled by order of emperors Ruizong, Wu Zetian's sucessor

00:35:36.249 --> 00:35:37.259
Harry believes

00:35:37.259 --> 00:35:43.349
there is a direct link between this destruction and the chronicles the tell of Wu's evil and incompetence

00:35:43.720 --> 00:35:47.099
Now that I know that Shangguan Wan'er's grave was dismantled

00:35:47.499 --> 00:35:52.379
this is part of an intentional process an intentional destruction of

00:35:53.079 --> 00:35:56.219
vestiges of female power during the late 7th and early 8th century

00:35:57.160 --> 00:36:02.220
The Confucian patriarchy striking back and re-establishing normative power

00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:15.460
By 690 ad

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:21.740
Wu Zetian had ascended the throne to become the first female emperor ever to rule the Chinese Empire

00:36:22.200 --> 00:36:25.010
But her opponents were determined to unseat her

00:36:25.950 --> 00:36:29.149
She had annihilated many many of her enemies

00:36:29.910 --> 00:36:33.619
but where there's power there are always rivals and

00:36:34.710 --> 00:36:36.710
There's always a contest

00:36:38.130 --> 00:36:42.200
Although there is clearly more to Wu Zetian than the ancient writers led us to believe

00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:48.259
There's also emerge that some of the tales of her callousness were not just propaganda

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.580
Art historian, Dr. Jenny Liu has discovered new texts in the tomb of Wu's

00:36:55.580 --> 00:37:01.009
great granddaughter princess Yongtai that suggests even blood knew no mercy

00:37:01.440 --> 00:37:04.340
I've studied other princess' epitaph as well

00:37:04.340 --> 00:37:10.429
And this is a passage here, which I've never seen. You have the character for anger. Okay, and

00:37:11.430 --> 00:37:13.430
anger at the

00:37:14.609 --> 00:37:16.560
The two

00:37:16.560 --> 00:37:18.030
boys

00:37:18.030 --> 00:37:20.540
and their secret medicine

00:37:21.660 --> 00:37:29.210
So this passage tells you what happened to princess Yongtai. These are characters that are usually used for

00:37:29.730 --> 00:37:30.869
the

00:37:30.869 --> 00:37:32.869
miscarriage or the loss of a child

00:37:33.570 --> 00:37:34.859
and

00:37:34.859 --> 00:37:42.289
It is the Zhang brothers secret medicine or poison that made her miscarriage leading to her death

00:37:44.070 --> 00:37:47.570
This refers to Wu Zetian because it's very possible that

00:37:47.670 --> 00:37:54.139
she was the instigator of the poison that Zhang brothers were very close to her and they did her bidding and she was known to

00:37:54.140 --> 00:38:00.859
have pitted people against each other in court and she would cause one to poison or kill the other and

00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:05.540
She did this with officials and now it seems maybe she did it with her

00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:07.560
relations her kin.

00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:11.920
What was the motive? Why? Why does she want the princess dead?

00:38:12.540 --> 00:38:18.320
She was bearing the child of two of the strongest clans in contention for the throne and

00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:22.490
it might be possible that she did not want this child to be born no matter the gender

00:38:25.500 --> 00:38:30.500
It would have been a very dangerous thing to get in the way of Wu Zetian

00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:47.059
As emperor of China Wu Zetian had successfully fought off all rivals to hold on to power

00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.240
But the fight had been bloody

00:38:51.740 --> 00:38:54.440
Wu Zetian became incredibly ruthless

00:38:55.420 --> 00:39:00.400
She had hundreds of members of the ruling family executed

00:39:01.859 --> 00:39:07.669
The violence and reign of terror you could say was extreme

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:15.079
But she was not without a conscience

00:39:17.250 --> 00:39:20.689
She was very troubled by what she'd done

00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:34.439
With her mind turning towards her afterlife, Wu wanted forgiveness of her sins

00:39:37.090 --> 00:39:38.980
She wrote a confession and

00:39:38.980 --> 00:39:45.750
had it engraved onto a golden tablet and had that tablet taken to a holy place to perform a sacred ritual

00:40:03.619 --> 00:40:05.619
So here we are on Mount Song

00:40:05.720 --> 00:40:13.149
It's the central of the five sacred peaks of ancient China and it became a very important place in Wu Zetian's later life

00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:17.740
In the year 700, Wu Zetian came to this mountain

00:40:17.779 --> 00:40:22.539
She had a golden tablet made on which she inscribes her sins

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:26.470
Which was then cast down the mountain as a as a form of absolution

00:40:28.099 --> 00:40:32.318
And we know precisely what that gold tablet said because nearly

00:40:33.319 --> 00:40:37.599
1300 years later a farmer found it lying in the earth on the mountain slopes

00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:47.169
Its description was short but its message profound

00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:51.400
And said

00:40:51.440 --> 00:40:55.450
The ruler Wu Zhao admires the true doubt with its long-lived immortal spirits

00:40:56.569 --> 00:41:02.679
Her servant has been commissioned to go reverently to the pinnacle of the central peak of Mount Song and cast the golden tally that

00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.900
might expiate her sinful nature

00:41:08.720 --> 00:41:14.409
What you can tell by the fact she's throwing away this tablet in such a visible fashion is that she's really trying to demonstrate

00:41:14.690 --> 00:41:16.690
To other people that she was repentant

00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:19.880
It's a very visible

00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.980
ceremonial thing it's it's saying I have sinned and I wish to be absolved of these sins and

00:41:24.170 --> 00:41:26.440
And whether she actually believed that was the case or not

00:41:26.440 --> 00:41:29.559
I think is is less important than the impression it would create to other people

00:41:34.250 --> 00:41:40.599
The end of Wu Zetian's reign had become fraught with scheming and rebellion among the male nobility at her court

00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:50.789
The higher she goes she becomes a tall poppy she becomes a bigger target

00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:05.519
Jonathan has come to a remote location in the foothills of Mount Song that Wu retreated to in her last year's

00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:08.140
It's awesome

00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.160
I've wanted to come here for a long time

00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:12.960
This is quite special

00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:16.400
This is the Songyue pagoda it's

00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:21.690
Important Wu Zetian's life because she's to come here to worship

00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:28.890
It's 1,500 years old not only is it still standing, it still looks pretty good

00:43:03.490 --> 00:43:04.630
So

00:43:04.630 --> 00:43:10.530
Wu Zetian would have come into this probably into this very building because this is the original structure from 1500 years ago

00:43:11.470 --> 00:43:15.689
I've never seen anything like this before. This is a phenomenal building

00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:20.909
You can feel why Wu Zetian would want to come here

00:43:21.059 --> 00:43:26.819
I mean Chang'an at this time is politically very difficult and she wants to come here to just escape all that

00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:30.360
It's it's a place of safety and refuge

00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:39.740
Throughout her life Wu' Zetian had shattered Confucian tradition

00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:45.320
Rising from a lowly concubine to become the only female Emperor of China

00:43:47.049 --> 00:43:49.049
She had achieved much

00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.739
She made China a better place for women,

00:43:55.470 --> 00:43:57.470
the Empire wealthy,

00:43:57.930 --> 00:44:00.169
peaceful, her capital city

00:44:00.750 --> 00:44:07.010
vibrant and cosmopolitan and her population fed and free to practice their religion

00:44:08.850 --> 00:44:14.989
But the male establishment was closing in and the She Emperor was too old to fight back

00:44:16.500 --> 00:44:19.429
When Wu Zetian's rule came to an end she was 80

00:44:20.130 --> 00:44:22.550
In fact, she wasn't usurped

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:24.660
she

00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:26.640
abdicated so

00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:31.490
She was still maintaining her own sense of control

00:44:39.220 --> 00:44:44.909
She lived for a few more months and she went quietly her time had come

00:44:47.320 --> 00:44:51.029
Emperor Wu Zetian died in 705

00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:07.840
This is Qianling the Tang dynasty mausoleum complex her final resting place

00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.900
She's buried in a secret chamber

00:45:11.120 --> 00:45:16.980
Deep inside the mountain alongside the Emperor she succeeded, her husband Gaozong

00:45:17.500 --> 00:45:19.420
We're on the spiritual path

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:21.580
Walking toward Wu Zetian's tomb

00:45:22.430 --> 00:45:25.540
It's impressive. It's daunting its powerful

00:45:26.510 --> 00:45:33.669
The area that it covers is almost the same as the Daming Palace. So it's a huge area

00:45:37.280 --> 00:45:44.259
The path to Wu Zetian's tomb is protected by Imperial bodyguards and sculptures to ward off evil spirits

00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.979
Beside the Gateway entrance the two sets of foreign emissaries lined up to pay homage

00:45:55.970 --> 00:45:59.380
Being here is a really awesome experience

00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.959
It's so impressive. Wu Zetian may have held power for more than half a century

00:46:05.780 --> 00:46:11.769
but in this place really her spirit and her sense of majesty and

00:46:12.170 --> 00:46:16.149
authority and power has lived on for many centuries

00:46:25.250 --> 00:46:31.300
Standing along Qianling is the carved steely honoring Wu Zetian's resting place

00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:37.699
By her decree, it was left blank inviting historians to write of her achievements and

00:46:38.220 --> 00:46:39.720
they did so

00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:41.720
distorting her story for centuries

00:46:43.230 --> 00:46:49.280
But having discovered more about her life, what would today's experts now carve upon the stand

00:46:50.750 --> 00:46:54.709
I would write something along the lines of she was woman who did what she had to to stay in power

00:46:54.960 --> 00:46:57.619
She was a great leader. She had a lot of political acumen

00:46:58.619 --> 00:47:03.589
But most of all I'd say she was the woman that proved that in a man's world. You didn't need a man to lead it

00:47:05.970 --> 00:47:13.369
The one word that I would put is just maverick because of the way that she went about gaining power

00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.129
I'd write nothing for her entire

00:47:23.790 --> 00:47:24.810
Idiosyncratic

00:47:24.810 --> 00:47:26.810
unprecedented political career

00:47:27.359 --> 00:47:32.209
Defied labels and for thirteen hundred years. She's defied historical verdict

00:47:32.369 --> 00:47:36.858
I think that the the blankness of the steely is a perfect monument
