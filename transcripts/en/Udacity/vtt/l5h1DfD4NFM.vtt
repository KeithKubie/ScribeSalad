00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:04.880
Let's do a quiz about temporal
locality to see if we understood it.

00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:10.030
Consider this code fragment, which is
basically iterating through an array and

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:13.100
adding every element of
that array to the sum.

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:17.690
Which of these memory locations has
temporal locality in this code?

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.100
The variable j, the variable sum,
and/or the elements of the array arr.

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:28.850
More than one might have temporal
locality so check all of those that do.
