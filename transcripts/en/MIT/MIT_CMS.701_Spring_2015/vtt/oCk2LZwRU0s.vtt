00:00:21.736 --> 00:00:23.610
LARA BALADI: That
demonstration I had been to

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:27.260
was for peace in Lebanon
during the war in 2006.

00:00:27.260 --> 00:00:31.503
And so it wasn't-- there was no
reason for so much police to be

00:00:31.503 --> 00:00:32.003
there.

00:00:32.003 --> 00:00:35.460
We were there to ask
for peace in the region.

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:38.300
So it wasn't about
revolution or toppling

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.430
the president or whatever.

00:00:40.430 --> 00:00:43.760
So I was really
shocked that there

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:49.090
was this really
ridiculous kind of fear

00:00:49.090 --> 00:00:52.820
from the Amn ad-Dawla,
the State Security.

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:56.660
And of course, what
happens is that when

00:00:56.660 --> 00:00:58.880
somebody makes a little
gesture, and there's

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.040
like a panic movement.

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:03.570
And of course, the police takes
advantage of it and panics,

00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:05.930
because they're 17 years
old or so, the policemen.

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:06.900
They're terrified.

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.420
And everybody's terrified.

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:09.420
Except they're armed.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:12.940
And they start beating people
up and arresting people.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:15.770
So from there, I thought
on the 25th of June,

00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:17.470
I thought, I'm not going down.

00:01:17.470 --> 00:01:20.320
I know what's going
to end up happening.

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:21.950
I'm going to get beaten up.

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.340
And then I realized I'm
like everybody else.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:26.790
I'm afraid.

00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:28.620
And the whole point
of the revolution

00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:29.580
was to break that fear.

00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:32.770
It was really that suddenly
nobody was afraid anymore,

00:01:32.770 --> 00:01:34.334
and that we actually
really went.

00:01:34.334 --> 00:01:36.500
And the fact that we were
all together in the street

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:38.760
was, like, OK, we're not
afraid, because also we're

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.990
all together.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:42.080
And it was really extraordinary.

00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:46.140
But I also saw that I wasn't
a photographer anymore.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.250
I had, like, 25 years ago began
my career as a photographer

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.930
and kind of got a
little bit out of it

00:01:52.930 --> 00:01:57.010
from watching digital
cameras and everybody

00:01:57.010 --> 00:02:00.670
becoming a photographer was
also part of my-- sort of how

00:02:00.670 --> 00:02:01.760
I evolved as an artist.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.500
And so I moved into using
images, but not so much being

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:08.430
so focused on making images.

00:02:08.430 --> 00:02:13.180
So for me, my role
in the revolution

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:17.280
was to really be
there as an Egyptian,

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:20.220
and to be there as a person
who loves that country,

00:02:20.220 --> 00:02:23.890
and who wants to
really see something

00:02:23.890 --> 00:02:25.930
through in that movement.

00:02:25.930 --> 00:02:29.830
So I really put myself, as
an artist, actually outside

00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:33.800
of everything, and for quite
a long time, just watched.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:35.270
I participated.

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:35.980
I was there.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:37.940
I met people.

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:39.110
I helped people.

00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:40.770
I was in the Square
all the time.

00:02:40.770 --> 00:02:44.500
But I did not take
lead in a way.

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:46.432
I did not produce art.

00:02:46.432 --> 00:02:47.640
I didn't want to do anything.

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.120
I just thought this is too much.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.650
I need to process
what's going on.

00:02:52.650 --> 00:02:54.490
So it's much later
in the process

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:58.340
that I started to
kind of take action

00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.015
in a way, or a different
action than being

00:03:01.015 --> 00:03:03.800
a citizen demonstrating.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:08.340
And this is when
these other Tahrir

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.760
Cinema and sort of very
time-based experiences

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:14.540
sort of happened.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:17.950
But that we'll talk
about a bit later.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:23.580
But my role, really-- I saw
my role as someone who could,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.740
from my experience and the
community that I know, someone

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.500
who could really connect
people to each other,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.220
and also watch a lot of
younger people than me,

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:35.000
and see that I could
really-- I had the experience

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.020
that they didn't have.

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:39.060
But they had, maybe,
the tools and the ways

00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:42.510
to operate that I also-- my
generation-- didn't have.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.560
My generation was much
more individualistic,

00:03:44.560 --> 00:03:46.860
and also a little
bit like a satellite.

00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:50.900
We worked as, like-- we
were apolitical, in a way.

00:03:50.900 --> 00:03:54.420
We were sort of--
I think we were--

00:03:54.420 --> 00:03:56.540
a lot of us were a
little bit outside

00:03:56.540 --> 00:03:59.060
of the political sphere,
because that wasn't the way

00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.250
to operate at the time.

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:01.750
So

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:04.235
To watch suddenly this
new generation come in

00:04:04.235 --> 00:04:08.260
and be very, very strong about
their political views and using

00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:11.470
social media and so
on was, like, OK,

00:04:11.470 --> 00:04:13.766
what can I give that
they don't have?

00:04:13.766 --> 00:04:14.890
And so it was really great.

00:04:14.890 --> 00:04:18.939
Because I met a lot of people
and I worked in that way

00:04:18.939 --> 00:04:20.000
with a lot of people.

00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:25.294
So it was a very organic
time, in that sense.

00:04:25.294 --> 00:04:27.460
And it led to a lot of
things which we'll talk about

00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:29.010
[INAUDIBLE].

00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:31.270
PROFESSOR: We have
a lot to talk about.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:33.060
In the classroom last
week, we were asking

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.600
ourselves, what is an activist?

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:38.900
How much someone should
be involved in a cause

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.755
to qualify as an activist?

00:04:41.755 --> 00:04:45.860
And we were comparing anonymous
members with Aaron Swartz.

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:48.630
And we were concluding that
Aaron Swartz was much more

00:04:48.630 --> 00:04:50.815
dedicated to the
cause than people

00:04:50.815 --> 00:04:56.630
who just do sit-in, online
sit-in from time to time.

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:59.850
I guess my question
would be in this case,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:03.720
are all protesters activists
in the context of a revolution?

00:05:03.720 --> 00:05:05.935
And do you consider
yourself as an activist?

00:05:05.935 --> 00:05:09.906
And when does the artist
become an activist?

00:05:09.906 --> 00:05:11.530
LARA BALADI: So no,
not every protester

00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:13.240
is an activist-- for sure not.

00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:16.020
I think every
protester is a citizen.

00:05:16.020 --> 00:05:20.230
Every protester that
comes to a demonstration

00:05:20.230 --> 00:05:22.040
doesn't necessarily
know why they're

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.240
coming to a demonstration.

00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.210
But this is a huge discussion.

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:29.230
But in the case of
Tahrir, a lot of people--

00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:35.430
there was something kind of
almost funny, when you look

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:38.500
at it in retrospect, is that--
I don't know if you remember,

00:05:38.500 --> 00:05:45.020
if you know-- but on the 25th of
Jan, the first group of people

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:46.780
go and demonstrate.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:53.960
On the 26th and 27th,
they-- the main activists

00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:58.360
of that first
demonstration-- start

00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:01.160
to kind of confuse the police
and exhaust the police, which

00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.530
was a technique.

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:08.010
On the 28th of Jan, everybody
is called to come to the square.

00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:08.957
It's a Friday.

00:06:08.957 --> 00:06:10.915
In Egypt, Friday is the
equivalent of a Sunday.

00:06:13.510 --> 00:06:18.460
On the 27th at night, before
this Friday where everybody's

00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.210
on holiday-- nobody's
going to go to work,

00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.190
so it's much more scary
for the government,

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.660
because they know
more people are

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:31.070
free to go demonstrating--
the tension was growing

00:06:31.070 --> 00:06:34.400
throughout the country,
not just in Cairo.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.340
And at 7:00 PM, there was rumors
that the government would stop

00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:42.120
our telephones and internet.

00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:45.260
At 9:00 PM, we couldn't talk
to each other on the phone.

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:46.594
We can only text.

00:06:46.594 --> 00:06:48.610
At 11:00 PM, we couldn't text.

00:06:48.610 --> 00:06:51.630
At 6:00 AM, we couldn't email
anybody or open internet.

00:06:51.630 --> 00:06:53.790
So it's kind of stupid.

00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:57.380
Because what do you do when you
don't have internet, telephone,

00:06:57.380 --> 00:06:59.570
and you don't have
a landline anymore?

00:06:59.570 --> 00:07:02.330
What's your natural instinct?

00:07:02.330 --> 00:07:03.650
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:03.650 --> 00:07:06.570
LARA BALADI: You go out,
try to go to [INAUDIBLE].

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:09.190
So it's in a funny
way, almost, I'd

00:07:09.190 --> 00:07:13.460
say it's almost the government
helped initiate this

00:07:13.460 --> 00:07:15.346
by shutting us down.

00:07:15.346 --> 00:07:16.720
And so of course,
we're all going

00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:17.730
to go look for each other.

00:07:17.730 --> 00:07:19.300
So everybody goes
down to the street

00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.841
in their area and talks to each
other, says, what's going on?

00:07:21.841 --> 00:07:23.216
Oh, let's go to Tahrir.

00:07:23.216 --> 00:07:25.090
Because of course, we
already know that there

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.540
are demonstrations going on.

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:30.650
So most of the
people are already

00:07:30.650 --> 00:07:33.920
informed that there are
demonstrations and marches that

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.160
will start after
the Friday prayer

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.630
at 1:00 from a lot of the main
mosques around the cities.

00:07:41.630 --> 00:07:45.240
But most of the people who
are not part of these marches

00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:47.952
necessarily will sort
of naturally join.

00:07:47.952 --> 00:07:49.160
And so this is what happened.

00:07:49.160 --> 00:07:53.690
So people found out
about the reasons

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:57.220
why this is happening,
how this is shaping itself

00:07:57.220 --> 00:07:58.480
as it was happening.

00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.460
There was no real--
it's not like everybody

00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:03.420
knew why they were going down.

00:08:03.420 --> 00:08:07.340
So people found themselves
activists, maybe after five

00:08:07.340 --> 00:08:09.570
days, 10 days, maybe overnight.

00:08:09.570 --> 00:08:11.660
So a good example--
and he's here

00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:13.500
Harvard if you have
a chance to go,

00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:17.350
maybe meet him or find out about
him-- but there's somebody,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:22.660
like a good example is
Bassem Youssef who's

00:08:22.660 --> 00:08:26.290
a comic now that's compared
to Jon Stewart in the US.

00:08:26.290 --> 00:08:29.060
But he was a heart surgeon.

00:08:29.060 --> 00:08:30.040
He was a doctor.

00:08:30.040 --> 00:08:30.730
He was studying.

00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:32.271
I think he was still,
like, finishing

00:08:32.271 --> 00:08:36.659
his studies or something, or
a very early practitioner.

00:08:36.659 --> 00:08:40.820
He filmed himself talking about
what was happening, posted

00:08:40.820 --> 00:08:44.250
the video on YouTube, three
months later had already five

00:08:44.250 --> 00:08:45.660
million people watching him.

00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:47.640
And then a month
later, a TV that

00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:51.240
came out of the revolution--
so a free channel-- asked

00:08:51.240 --> 00:08:52.510
him to do a show.

00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:54.530
And he became a
really famous figure

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:56.630
over the period of two
years that followed.

00:08:56.630 --> 00:08:59.580
So this is an example of
someone who's a citizen,

00:08:59.580 --> 00:09:02.640
but then becomes an
activist, but then becomes--

00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:03.905
finds a new voice for himself.

00:09:03.905 --> 00:09:05.780
PROFESSOR: So it's a
fluid category, kind of.

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:08.840
LARA BALADI: So I mean,
everybody changed our life.

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:11.410
Like, I mean, everybody--
maybe a lot of people.

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:14.590
But I would say that
we all lost our friends

00:09:14.590 --> 00:09:15.554
and made new friends.

00:09:15.554 --> 00:09:17.720
Because suddenly when you
can't talk about politics,

00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:20.710
you realize that you don't get
along with anyone around you.

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.890
And it's like, oops,
I don't think so.

00:09:23.890 --> 00:09:28.610
This is such a huge,
impactful moment in history.

00:09:28.610 --> 00:09:31.640
You cannot make a compromise.

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.800
There's no time for it.

00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:34.090
There's no energy for it.

00:09:34.090 --> 00:09:36.840
And it's going so fast,
and it's so intense.

00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:39.290
You have to go to
what you believe for.

00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.490
And so you make choices.

00:09:40.490 --> 00:09:42.290
And these choices--
you watch people

00:09:42.290 --> 00:09:44.440
sort of drop out of your life.

00:09:44.440 --> 00:09:47.045
Suddenly, you're
completely negotiating

00:09:47.045 --> 00:09:50.980
a completely differ-- so these
aren't fixed-- what you are

00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:53.930
and how you [INAUDIBLE] that.

00:09:53.930 --> 00:09:57.120
And to talk about how
an artist becomes,

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.670
what an artist does
in a revolution,

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:08.250
I mean, this example behind me
is a piece that I did in 2007.

00:10:08.250 --> 00:10:11.270
And the revolution
started in 2011.

00:10:11.270 --> 00:10:13.060
To give you a
configuration of Cairo,

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.370
you have those
famous lions that you

00:10:15.370 --> 00:10:20.750
see the picture are the
entrance of a famous bridge,

00:10:20.750 --> 00:10:22.500
called the [INAUDIBLE]
Bridge, [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:25.780
means bridge, so
the Nile Bridge.

00:10:25.780 --> 00:10:31.150
And in front of those
lions, actually, is Tahrir.

00:10:31.150 --> 00:10:34.760
So it's a landmark a little bit
like the Pyramids or the Eiffel

00:10:34.760 --> 00:10:35.850
Tower.

00:10:35.850 --> 00:10:39.360
It's a famous area in Cairo,
and people would naturally

00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:41.320
go visit it.

00:10:41.320 --> 00:10:44.330
And so in 2007, I
made this piece,

00:10:44.330 --> 00:10:46.700
which is called
Justice for the Mother.

00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.070
Egypt in Arabic is
called the Mother

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.700
of the World, Um al-Dunya.

00:10:55.250 --> 00:11:00.070
And so this work was really a
work about-- it was actually

00:11:00.070 --> 00:11:03.340
a portrait of my
father and a portrait

00:11:03.340 --> 00:11:06.910
of the law of the
jungle-- the strongest

00:11:06.910 --> 00:11:10.650
is always the one
that wins a fight.

00:11:10.650 --> 00:11:12.300
But while I'm doing
this work and sort

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.090
of studying this
kind of psychology

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:16.820
of how human beings fight
each other, and who wins

00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:21.170
and who loses,
using these images

00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:26.000
that I've collected
in my work, I

00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.900
attended this demonstration
I told you about,

00:11:28.900 --> 00:11:32.210
where this huge cordon of
police was circling us.

00:11:32.210 --> 00:11:34.260
And I was really shocked
by it, because nobody

00:11:34.260 --> 00:11:38.100
in that demonstration
had the same purpose.

00:11:38.100 --> 00:11:40.050
There was five or six
people who were actually

00:11:40.050 --> 00:11:40.979
there for Lebanon.

00:11:40.979 --> 00:11:43.020
But really, people were
there because either they

00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:46.520
were passing by, or
they were activists,

00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:50.730
or they were asking for the
bread to be less expensive.

00:11:50.730 --> 00:11:53.630
I mean, everybody had a kind
of different cause and purpose.

00:11:53.630 --> 00:12:00.160
And so this sort of
like weird incoherence

00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:02.470
of that demonstration
really stuck with me.

00:12:02.470 --> 00:12:03.537
And so this was a parody.

00:12:03.537 --> 00:12:05.120
So this is a detail
of the piece where

00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:07.957
it's a parody of people
demonstrating and asking

00:12:07.957 --> 00:12:08.540
for something.

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:11.860
But everybody seems to
be, like, on their own.

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:13.500
So you can see John
Travolta, which

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:17.970
is not your generation,
but a little bit mine.

00:12:17.970 --> 00:12:21.030
Condoleezza Rice during
the war in Lebanon,

00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.220
so with bombs and missiles
that say, I'm sorry, I'm sorry,

00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.110
I'm sorry, and all
kinds of character

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.910
that seem to be revolting.

00:12:30.910 --> 00:12:35.906
And so interestingly,
when Tahrir started,

00:12:35.906 --> 00:12:37.280
suddenly I look
at my work, and I

00:12:37.280 --> 00:12:38.738
think, what am I
supposed to do now

00:12:38.738 --> 00:12:41.570
that there's this
huge revolution

00:12:41.570 --> 00:12:43.790
or uprising happening?

00:12:43.790 --> 00:12:45.070
Am I supposed to work?

00:12:45.070 --> 00:12:47.390
And I'm watching all these
kids and all these people

00:12:47.390 --> 00:12:49.630
produ-- even citizens,
not just artists,

00:12:49.630 --> 00:12:53.465
but citizens producing
videos, and uploading footage,

00:12:53.465 --> 00:12:57.460
and making jokes, and doing
this crazy, amazing stuff.

00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.190
And I don't work like this.

00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:01.940
I work-- I take time to work.

00:13:01.940 --> 00:13:03.900
And I worked under dictatorship.

00:13:03.900 --> 00:13:08.140
So in a way, my work was
shaped by the stagnant regime

00:13:08.140 --> 00:13:10.360
under which I was
working, and which

00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:15.980
I was trying to also sort
of mirror by making work

00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:18.640
that kind of demands
attention and in a sense

00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:21.590
are heavy sometimes,
but that mirrored

00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.970
that kind of rigidity of the
regime I was working under.

00:13:25.970 --> 00:13:29.160
And looking back at this
work as one of the works

00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:32.740
was really funny,
because I was, like, wow,

00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.340
I depicted a kind of
problematic paradise

00:13:36.340 --> 00:13:39.200
behind those lines,
which is-- it's

00:13:39.200 --> 00:13:41.660
actually a portrait of Tahrir.

00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:45.980
And that's how it
felt. That's how

00:13:45.980 --> 00:13:49.360
the being 18 days
in the square really

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:54.230
felt like there was a
possible world that we

00:13:54.230 --> 00:13:57.860
had to experience, and
we were experiencing

00:13:57.860 --> 00:14:00.430
in very small moments.

00:14:00.430 --> 00:14:02.740
But those moments where
this is a possibility,

00:14:02.740 --> 00:14:04.550
this is a seed of
something that could

00:14:04.550 --> 00:14:08.190
happen-- maybe in 2,000
years, maybe 200 years, maybe

00:14:08.190 --> 00:14:08.790
in 10 years.

00:14:08.790 --> 00:14:10.040
We don't know, maybe tomorrow.

00:14:10.040 --> 00:14:10.880
I have no idea.

00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:12.950
But it's possible.

00:14:12.950 --> 00:14:16.880
And it's that sort
of sense that really

00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:18.640
was really interesting for me.

00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:21.660
And it took me a long
time to kind of think, OK,

00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:23.730
how do I work now?

00:14:23.730 --> 00:14:25.170
So this is also
another question.

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:27.100
Because then I start
collecting footage

00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:30.190
and working with archive,
and collecting pictures.

00:14:30.190 --> 00:14:33.700
But I wanted to show this
as a kind of relationship

00:14:33.700 --> 00:14:38.780
to how the world
changed overnight.

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:43.011
And so there was a moment
of reflection and kind

00:14:43.011 --> 00:14:46.808
of absorbing what was
happening before doing things.

00:14:46.808 --> 00:14:48.766
PROFESSOR: This was made
before the revolution.

00:14:48.766 --> 00:14:50.702
LARA BALADI: Yes, 2007,
four years before.

00:14:50.702 --> 00:14:52.160
PROFESSOR: I think
it kind of shows

00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:55.430
that your work was
already political

00:14:55.430 --> 00:14:58.074
before the revolution, even
though you didn't really

00:14:58.074 --> 00:14:58.880
notice.

00:14:58.880 --> 00:15:00.296
There was something
political in--

00:15:00.296 --> 00:15:02.250
LARA BALADI: No, I did notice.

00:15:02.250 --> 00:15:03.930
I did notice.

00:15:03.930 --> 00:15:06.740
But it was just a different
language I was using.

00:15:06.740 --> 00:15:10.370
I mean, this work--
this is Cairo.

00:15:10.370 --> 00:15:11.420
I want to show you.

00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:15.210
These are informal
areas in Cairo,

00:15:15.210 --> 00:15:20.110
which are basically illegal
constructions and slums.

00:15:20.110 --> 00:15:23.870
And this was a tower that
I built in the Opera House

00:15:23.870 --> 00:15:26.420
in the center of Cairo,
which is a military base,

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:28.310
and which is where
the Biennial of art

00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:30.690
takes place-- used
to take place.

00:15:30.690 --> 00:15:34.560
And so this work was
directly a kind of statement

00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:37.690
to the government to say OK,
the subject of your Biennial

00:15:37.690 --> 00:15:39.470
is the others.

00:15:39.470 --> 00:15:41.932
So what are you doing
with the others?

00:15:41.932 --> 00:15:44.140
Who are the others in
relationship to the government?

00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:46.176
They're all the people
they're not addressing.

00:15:46.176 --> 00:15:47.550
They're not
addressing the issues

00:15:47.550 --> 00:15:49.900
that these people have
and face every day.

00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:53.580
And so I built an informal
tower, a slum tower,

00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.820
in the middle of the garden
of this military base.

00:15:57.820 --> 00:15:58.970
I made my own brick.

00:15:58.970 --> 00:16:00.750
You can see the donkey here.

00:16:00.750 --> 00:16:03.650
And it says "hope" on it.

00:16:03.650 --> 00:16:06.720
And here you can see the tower
at night with the Opera House

00:16:06.720 --> 00:16:08.220
just behind.

00:16:08.220 --> 00:16:12.140
And of course, this
was very controversial.

00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:16.870
Because it was like, wow,
like putting people--

00:16:16.870 --> 00:16:17.760
you don't go there.

00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:20.530
So I'm going to
bring there to you.

00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:25.950
And this was really like a year
before the revolution, a year

00:16:25.950 --> 00:16:27.400
and a half before
the revolution.

00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:33.920
So this work was really, really
loaded and very much discussed

00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:36.850
later as a kind of
movement in the art world,

00:16:36.850 --> 00:16:41.380
as how artists were putting
their-- saying, you know,

00:16:41.380 --> 00:16:43.520
hello, alert, alert, beep, beep.

00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:48.520
There's something happening
here that you need to look at.

00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:50.380
So this was the
kind of landscape

00:16:50.380 --> 00:16:52.470
we were in when the
revolution started

00:16:52.470 --> 00:16:54.820
in terms of the art scene.

00:16:54.820 --> 00:16:56.510
PROFESSOR: Yes, Ali.

00:16:56.510 --> 00:17:02.425
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] were
you inspired by Bosch?

00:17:02.425 --> 00:17:04.550
LARA BALADI: That's what
everybody always tells me.

00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:06.010
AUDIENCE: It looks so similar.

00:17:06.010 --> 00:17:06.670
LARA BALADI: Thank
you very much.

00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:08.336
It's always a very
beautiful compliment.

00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.190
I actually love painting.

00:17:13.190 --> 00:17:13.940
I'm not a painter.

00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:16.310
And I wish I could be.

00:17:16.310 --> 00:17:19.240
But I'm sure I will
be at some point.

00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:20.989
I've made other
people paint for me.

00:17:20.989 --> 00:17:22.655
Because in Egypt, we
have this tradition

00:17:22.655 --> 00:17:26.930
of making painted
billboards for the cinema.

00:17:26.930 --> 00:17:30.350
I mean, in the good old days,
they still existed like this.

00:17:30.350 --> 00:17:33.540
But yes, a lot of
people compare my work

00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.822
to Bosch because
of the kind of--

00:17:37.822 --> 00:17:39.040
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.730
LARA BALADI: The delight,
the Paradise depiction.

00:17:41.730 --> 00:17:43.430
But actually, when
you get closer to it,

00:17:43.430 --> 00:17:46.440
it shows all the
disruptions that

00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:49.170
are happening in this
depiction of Paradise

00:17:49.170 --> 00:17:53.280
and how, in fact,
it's closer to Hell.

00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:58.790
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] I saw the
similarity to the free expanse,

00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:02.786
but also the two lions
separated into a very

00:18:02.786 --> 00:18:03.650
three-paneled piece.

00:18:03.650 --> 00:18:05.854
It also just seemed
very similar,

00:18:05.854 --> 00:18:07.312
and I really like
that [INAUDIBLE].

00:18:09.572 --> 00:18:10.530
LARA BALADI: Thank you.

00:18:13.320 --> 00:18:18.040
PROFESSOR: OK, so now we'll
enter in the discussion

00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:20.790
we're supposed to
have today related

00:18:20.790 --> 00:18:22.560
to the assigned readings.

00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:24.510
And what I did,
actually, is that I

00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:27.670
used the assigned readings
to build my questions.

00:18:27.670 --> 00:18:31.000
And I'm going to use these
questions as a pretext

00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.230
to kind of push in a
little bit of theory,

00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:39.350
so it looks more like a course
than just a casual discussion.

00:18:39.350 --> 00:18:41.670
And then after, we'll
try to connect this

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:45.380
to your own
experience as someone

00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.590
experimented the revolution.

00:18:47.590 --> 00:18:50.220
So the first thing I
would like to talk about

00:18:50.220 --> 00:18:53.350
is the rise of digital
rebellions, citizen journalism

00:18:53.350 --> 00:18:57.370
and cyber left, which did
not start with the Arab

00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.480
Spring and the Occupy
Movement, but started

00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:05.420
12 years before with the
creation of Indymedia, which

00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:08.860
is a global, federated network
of independent media centers,

00:19:08.860 --> 00:19:13.400
radio stations, newspapers,
video collectives and websites.

00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:16.980
And Indymedia was
already only funded

00:19:16.980 --> 00:19:20.230
as an alternative and
a direct challenge

00:19:20.230 --> 00:19:24.770
to corporate media
like CBS and CNN.

00:19:24.770 --> 00:19:28.360
Most [INAUDIBLE] report on
the counter demonstration

00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:31.590
and the police brutality
that took place

00:19:31.590 --> 00:19:37.530
during the 1999 World Trade
Organization meetings.

00:19:37.530 --> 00:19:40.790
And during its first
week, the website

00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:45.497
received 1.5 million hits,
outpacing CNN website

00:19:45.497 --> 00:19:46.330
for the same period.

00:19:46.330 --> 00:19:48.070
It was quite something.

00:19:48.070 --> 00:19:50.040
It was really big.

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.780
And as the platform
developed, it

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:54.450
became more than an alternative
media outlet, but also

00:19:54.450 --> 00:19:58.190
a think tank and activist
laboratory and mobilizing tool

00:19:58.190 --> 00:19:59.990
for the anti-globalization
movement.

00:19:59.990 --> 00:20:03.100
So for those who don't remember,
the anti-globalization movement

00:20:03.100 --> 00:20:05.240
was against free
trade agreements

00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.350
that would be at the
disadvantage of the poorest.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:12.840
And so this platform
was allowing people

00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:14.960
different movement,
different struggle,

00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:19.650
to kind of merge together
on the same platform--

00:20:19.650 --> 00:20:25.640
movements as diverse as
the Zapatista-Mayan peasant

00:20:25.640 --> 00:20:28.370
army from the poorest
region of Mexico,

00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.570
the South central
farmer movement in LA,

00:20:30.570 --> 00:20:33.260
a movement against
Wal-Mart in Philadelphia,

00:20:33.260 --> 00:20:34.690
and movement
against war in Iraq.

00:20:34.690 --> 00:20:37.050
So it was very diverse,
but it was all converging

00:20:37.050 --> 00:20:40.050
on this platform here.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:41.780
And at that time,
the activists were

00:20:41.780 --> 00:20:45.760
using chatrooms, the listservs,
wiki pages where people could

00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:48.650
upload their stories, their
report, their pictures,

00:20:48.650 --> 00:20:50.750
their videos.

00:20:50.750 --> 00:20:54.150
And so Indymedia was really
one of the first websites

00:20:54.150 --> 00:20:58.370
where 100s of people were
uploading content, generating

00:20:58.370 --> 00:20:59.630
content.

00:20:59.630 --> 00:21:02.600
And in this book,
Digital Rebellion,

00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:05.740
Todd Wolfson claimed that
Indymedia, with its slogan,

00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:09.830
"Don't Hate the Media, Be the
Media," was kind of a precursor

00:21:09.830 --> 00:21:12.510
or catalyst for
social media, but also

00:21:12.510 --> 00:21:16.380
the grassroots journalism--
citizen journalism.

00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.050
Lara, in your article,
"When Seeing is Belonging"

00:21:20.050 --> 00:21:22.150
that is very good, and
I recommend everybody

00:21:22.150 --> 00:21:27.470
to read it-- it's online-- you
argue that September 11 also

00:21:27.470 --> 00:21:31.080
contributed to the rise
of citizen journalism.

00:21:31.080 --> 00:21:33.322
You want to tell us a
little more about this idea?

00:21:33.322 --> 00:21:34.030
LARA BALADI: Yes.

00:21:34.030 --> 00:21:41.700
I mean, I wrote this article
because of my relationship

00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:45.880
to photography, and how this
is how I began my career.

00:21:45.880 --> 00:21:49.360
And I found it was quite
shocking to watch everybody--

00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:51.530
can I go back to some
of these images--

00:21:51.530 --> 00:21:53.640
to watch everybody take
photos in the square.

00:21:58.208 --> 00:22:00.760
Like this is quite
an interesting image.

00:22:00.760 --> 00:22:04.260
So watching this
kind of scene, and I

00:22:04.260 --> 00:22:07.760
was myself holding a camera
that was actually broken.

00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:11.260
So it was making scratch--
it had scratch like that.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.860
I was, like, hmm,
look at everybody's

00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:15.190
really documenting this.

00:22:15.190 --> 00:22:19.510
And I look back at my life, and
thinking, OK, what do I do now?

00:22:19.510 --> 00:22:22.590
Because I felt a bit frozen.

00:22:22.590 --> 00:22:26.100
As I described, the way
I work is I need time.

00:22:26.100 --> 00:22:28.500
And in a moment where
you're in the middle of a--

00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.500
when the dam breaks, the river
goes really, really fast.

00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.880
So you better be your
head out of the water

00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.890
and go with the flow.

00:22:38.890 --> 00:22:43.050
Which, in a stagnant
regime, it's

00:22:43.050 --> 00:22:45.890
more like being in a lake
that is very stagnant.

00:22:45.890 --> 00:22:49.320
And you have to keep going
down, and kind of trying

00:22:49.320 --> 00:22:51.255
move [INAUDIBLE] so
that something happens.

00:22:51.255 --> 00:22:53.010
So it's a very
different situation.

00:22:53.010 --> 00:22:56.910
So that sense made me look
back, and maybe look back

00:22:56.910 --> 00:22:59.080
at photography, and
the use of media,

00:22:59.080 --> 00:23:02.230
and the use of image making,
the history of image making.

00:23:02.230 --> 00:23:04.170
And I remember
starting photography

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:11.060
when I was coming out of school
and the first Gulf War started.

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:15.220
And that was a moment in
media where the war in Iraq

00:23:15.220 --> 00:23:17.560
was shown live on CNN.

00:23:17.560 --> 00:23:19.307
And that was one of
the only channels

00:23:19.307 --> 00:23:20.390
that was actually filming.

00:23:20.390 --> 00:23:21.765
But you could
never see anything.

00:23:21.765 --> 00:23:22.760
It was always dark.

00:23:22.760 --> 00:23:24.390
And little lights
would come out.

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.080
And you didn't know
what was going on.

00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:27.890
It was just like you
could see explosions,

00:23:27.890 --> 00:23:31.090
or-- that was a really
important moment,

00:23:31.090 --> 00:23:36.040
in terms of discussing and
debating the role of media

00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:40.210
and watching war
live on television.

00:23:40.210 --> 00:23:45.540
10 years later, there was 9/11.

00:23:45.540 --> 00:23:48.310
And I don't know how
old you guys were,

00:23:48.310 --> 00:23:52.360
but it was a time when
social media didn't exist.

00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:55.170
Most people didn't
have mobile phones.

00:23:55.170 --> 00:23:56.820
And if they did
have mobile phones,

00:23:56.820 --> 00:23:59.640
they didn't have cameras
on their mobile phones.

00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:03.120
So what was much more
the thing of the time

00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:05.280
was to have a digital
camera in your bag.

00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:07.230
And it was usually
very low resolution.

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:09.180
But it was nevertheless digital.

00:24:09.180 --> 00:24:14.200
And that was the early
days of creating media,

00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:15.590
in digital form.

00:24:15.590 --> 00:24:18.030
So suddenly, 10
years later, here I

00:24:18.030 --> 00:24:19.605
am in the middle
of this revolution,

00:24:19.605 --> 00:24:23.710
and watching everybody
upload material,

00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:25.140
I mean, as fast as I'm talking.

00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:27.780
There's already 1,000 videos
that would have been uploaded.

00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:33.870
So this whole-- over 20
years, but every decade,

00:24:33.870 --> 00:24:37.250
this new platform that
image making reaches

00:24:37.250 --> 00:24:39.020
was, for me, really,
really fascinating.

00:24:39.020 --> 00:24:41.860
And yes, one of the
things that came out

00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.890
of all the discourses
and the debates

00:24:43.890 --> 00:24:47.920
around photography and image
making and media in general

00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:53.250
after 9/11 was that, for
the first time in years,

00:24:53.250 --> 00:24:56.320
the power had
changed hands-- where

00:24:56.320 --> 00:25:00.220
the citizen-- the ones who
were underneath, or very close,

00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:07.230
or watching from buildings
and over windows--

00:25:07.230 --> 00:25:10.190
were able to document
what was happening.

00:25:10.190 --> 00:25:12.900
The media wasn't there.
[INAUDIBLE] citizens.

00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.630
And that was a really,
really big moment in history,

00:25:15.630 --> 00:25:20.300
in terms of suddenly the citizen
had power that the media didn't

00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:21.410
have anymore.

00:25:21.410 --> 00:25:25.260
So that hold on the power
and in whose hand is always

00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:27.680
at the core, I think, at
the heart of those debates,

00:25:27.680 --> 00:25:30.336
especially moments like that.

00:25:30.336 --> 00:25:31.710
PROFESSOR: So it
was interesting,

00:25:31.710 --> 00:25:35.150
and this is where I speak
about citizen journalism,

00:25:35.150 --> 00:25:39.420
and how and why that
moment in Tahrir

00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:40.670
was really interesting for me.

00:25:40.670 --> 00:25:44.292
Because I had seen this
throughout my career

00:25:44.292 --> 00:25:46.250
as a photographer and
artist, and watched that.

00:25:46.250 --> 00:25:49.860
And I was really
fascinated with it.

00:25:49.860 --> 00:25:54.790
Let's talk about the role of
media in mobilizing people.

00:25:54.790 --> 00:25:56.620
So Facebook and
Twitter are often

00:25:56.620 --> 00:26:01.550
depicted as the main instruments
of the Arab Revolution,

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:05.670
to the point that the revolution
has been called a social media

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.640
revolution, a Facebook
revolution, Twitter revolution.

00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:12.640
And apparently, one
of the main elements

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:16.360
that contributed
to this [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:16.360 --> 00:26:18.870
uniting the young Egyptians
that were not, as you said,

00:26:18.870 --> 00:26:22.680
necessarily into
politics at that time,

00:26:22.680 --> 00:26:25.900
was this Facebook page that
we spoke about earlier.

00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:27.350
We are all Khaled Saeed.

00:26:27.350 --> 00:26:29.450
I know I don't pronounce
it well, but I try.

00:26:29.450 --> 00:26:30.516
LARA BALADI: [INAUDIBLE].

00:26:30.516 --> 00:26:32.950
PROFESSOR: I'm sorry about that.

00:26:32.950 --> 00:26:35.182
And apparently, this
page was protesting

00:26:35.182 --> 00:26:37.515
against the death of this
young blogger after his arrest

00:26:37.515 --> 00:26:38.098
by the police.

00:26:38.098 --> 00:26:40.460
And it said, even
showing pictures

00:26:40.460 --> 00:26:43.580
of his disfigured corpse,
I think, at the beginning,

00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:45.600
I guess, maybe.

00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:48.450
And according to
the author of one

00:26:48.450 --> 00:26:51.410
of the texts that we had
to read today, Gerbaudo,

00:26:51.410 --> 00:26:54.706
this page was successful
because it individualized

00:26:54.706 --> 00:26:55.580
Facebook interaction.

00:26:58.670 --> 00:27:02.230
I think he was talking as if
he was Khaled Saeed, actually,

00:27:02.230 --> 00:27:03.756
at the beginning.

00:27:03.756 --> 00:27:06.370
And at some point
during the revolution,

00:27:06.370 --> 00:27:10.620
apparently it became kind of
a place to collect evidences

00:27:10.620 --> 00:27:14.420
against the regime and
against the police brutality,

00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:18.760
and a sort of megaphone that
was relaying information

00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:22.060
about events that were coming.

00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:25.850
And apparently, it also served
to build up the confidence

00:27:25.850 --> 00:27:26.750
about the movement.

00:27:26.750 --> 00:27:30.580
So my question was,
when did you see

00:27:30.580 --> 00:27:32.550
this page for the first time?

00:27:32.550 --> 00:27:34.590
And how did it affect
your motivation

00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:36.300
to kind of get involved?

00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:43.580
And do you believe
that, when you saw that,

00:27:43.580 --> 00:27:46.870
did you believe that
it was an important,

00:27:46.870 --> 00:27:50.440
a positional movement, that
was kind of rising in Egypt?

00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.876
Was it the proof that
something was going on?

00:27:53.876 --> 00:27:55.500
LARA BALADI: So that's
a nice question,

00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:59.590
because I was not on Facebook
when the revolution started.

00:27:59.590 --> 00:28:02.719
So I had no idea even, like, why
people even went on Facebook.

00:28:02.719 --> 00:28:04.760
It was just I could hear
my friend talk about it.

00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:06.233
I was just horrified.

00:28:06.233 --> 00:28:08.520
I was like, [INAUDIBLE] there.

00:28:08.520 --> 00:28:10.160
So no, I was not on Facebook.

00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.080
I did not have a
Twitter account.

00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:13.820
I didn't even know
Twitter existed.

00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:18.110
I knew about Facebook, but--
and I didn't have a television I

00:28:18.110 --> 00:28:18.930
still don't.

00:28:18.930 --> 00:28:25.470
So my relationship with internet
was a good relationship,

00:28:25.470 --> 00:28:27.230
but it wasn't like
a very-- I wasn't

00:28:27.230 --> 00:28:31.630
like a freak surfer on the net.

00:28:31.630 --> 00:28:34.630
It wasn't like I was spending
hours looking for things,

00:28:34.630 --> 00:28:37.840
or using it in ways
that I use it now.

00:28:37.840 --> 00:28:43.170
So I wasn't aware of that page.

00:28:43.170 --> 00:28:45.670
I remember when Khaled
Saeed was killed,

00:28:45.670 --> 00:28:47.740
and I felt something
is about to happen.

00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.830
And this was maybe 18 months
before the revolution started.

00:28:50.830 --> 00:28:52.370
It was in June, 2010.

00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:56.300
The revolution started
in January, 2011.

00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:00.800
What I can say-- I mean, of
course I saw the page later.

00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:03.150
And I think it had an
extraordinary impact.

00:29:03.150 --> 00:29:05.750
But I think the
interesting story here,

00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:13.190
which-- to go back to
some of the images--

00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:18.330
the interesting story here is
how this Facebook page began.

00:29:18.330 --> 00:29:20.650
Because we're not talking
about making a Facebook

00:29:20.650 --> 00:29:24.560
page and-- this is [INAUDIBLE].

00:29:24.560 --> 00:29:28.080
So we're not talking about
making a Facebook page now,

00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.280
or in a normal
kind of situation,

00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:34.230
or in a kind of relatively
normal situation.

00:29:34.230 --> 00:29:37.280
I don't know what the
normal situation would be.

00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.280
We're talking about a Facebook
page under Mubarak regime.

00:29:42.280 --> 00:29:43.970
And at the end of
the Mubarak regime,

00:29:43.970 --> 00:29:45.890
Amn ad-Dawla, the
State Security,

00:29:45.890 --> 00:29:47.830
was incredibly
powerful-- probably

00:29:47.830 --> 00:29:50.720
one of the most
powerful securities

00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:52.860
for sure in the
region, and probably

00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:54.700
across many other
countries in the world.

00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:59.980
So you're talking about a very
corrupted time in history,

00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:03.060
and a very, very
intense time, where

00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:05.926
there is no way anybody could
say who they were or say

00:30:05.926 --> 00:30:07.550
anything about the
regime, because they

00:30:07.550 --> 00:30:11.090
would be immediately arrested--
let alone on Facebook, which

00:30:11.090 --> 00:30:13.680
is a public space, as you know.

00:30:13.680 --> 00:30:21.310
So the story goes that
there was the administrator

00:30:21.310 --> 00:30:26.120
of Google Egypt, who was in
Dubai for a conference, who's

00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.230
a young guy who's now
in LA, Wael Ghonim.

00:30:29.230 --> 00:30:35.700
And one of the activists of one
of the very small but very new

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.520
and probably, obviously,
very important--

00:30:38.520 --> 00:30:42.280
that became very important--
political opposition group that

00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:46.870
formed itself and called
itself Sixth of April--

00:30:46.870 --> 00:30:49.550
formed itself after
the events that

00:30:49.550 --> 00:30:53.420
took place in 2010 of all
the workers in the Delta

00:30:53.420 --> 00:30:55.590
in the north of
Egypt that rebelled

00:30:55.590 --> 00:30:58.210
against the conditions
of how they were working

00:30:58.210 --> 00:31:00.040
and how much they
were paid and so on.

00:31:00.040 --> 00:31:01.623
And a lot of these
people were killed.

00:31:01.623 --> 00:31:03.270
A lot of them were arrested.

00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:08.130
It was pretty much-- it was one
of the very important moments

00:31:08.130 --> 00:31:12.780
pre-revolution that marked
this real disruption

00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:15.620
between the corrupted
regime and the people.

00:31:15.620 --> 00:31:19.270
And so after that day,
that group formed itself.

00:31:19.270 --> 00:31:20.910
So one of the people
from that group

00:31:20.910 --> 00:31:25.240
was in that same conference,
and sat next to Wael Ghonim,

00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:26.700
but didn't tell him who he was.

00:31:26.700 --> 00:31:30.060
And Wael Ghonim didn't
tell him who he was.

00:31:30.060 --> 00:31:33.810
They were just on internet, as
people do it in internet cafe,

00:31:33.810 --> 00:31:35.721
or when they have--
like you guys were

00:31:35.721 --> 00:31:36.970
at the beginning of the class.

00:31:36.970 --> 00:31:39.630
They sort of sit
together, google stuff,

00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.610
and sometimes talk.

00:31:41.610 --> 00:31:45.510
And at one point, one of
them said, how can we get

00:31:45.510 --> 00:31:48.510
people to actually participate?

00:31:48.510 --> 00:31:50.870
How do we collect people?

00:31:50.870 --> 00:31:52.960
How do we bring
people's attention?

00:31:52.960 --> 00:31:54.220
What would we do?

00:31:54.220 --> 00:31:57.570
And so Wael told him, you know,
let's make this Facebook page.

00:31:57.570 --> 00:31:59.880
And you can do this,
and you can do that.

00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.877
And that's the way that you kind
of attract people's attention.

00:32:02.877 --> 00:32:04.960
So I don't know what was
the conversation exactly.

00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:05.770
I wish I was there.

00:32:05.770 --> 00:32:06.280
I wasn't.

00:32:06.280 --> 00:32:10.650
But from that conversation,
and not knowing each other,

00:32:10.650 --> 00:32:13.570
and still not knowing
each other afterwards,

00:32:13.570 --> 00:32:17.500
that's how they created
this Facebook page.

00:32:17.500 --> 00:32:21.050
And people started to join
and like, and like, and like.

00:32:21.050 --> 00:32:22.800
And before we knew it,
there was thousands

00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.290
of people on the page.

00:32:24.290 --> 00:32:28.270
And of course, with
the events in Tunis

00:32:28.270 --> 00:32:29.860
followed by the
events that started

00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:34.340
to escalate in Cairo and
Egypt, the Facebook page

00:32:34.340 --> 00:32:40.020
became more and more and more
kind of catalyzer or something

00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:42.130
that was about to happen.

00:32:42.130 --> 00:32:45.080
So I think that's the
real role of that page.

00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:47.120
Now, that page was
essentially addressed

00:32:47.120 --> 00:32:52.160
to people who are in the
age range of age of Khaled--

00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:56.010
so late '20s.

00:32:56.010 --> 00:32:58.410
I don't know what's the
percentage in America,

00:32:58.410 --> 00:33:05.650
but in Egypt there is 65% of
the population is below 30 years

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.080
old.

00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:07.950
That's huge.

00:33:07.950 --> 00:33:09.760
We're a very young country.

00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:12.030
There's lots of babies
everyday that are born.

00:33:12.030 --> 00:33:14.840
So it's like when you're
talking to somebody who's

00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:19.710
27 being killed-- imagine the
impact on the similar kind

00:33:19.710 --> 00:33:22.980
of people in the population.

00:33:22.980 --> 00:33:32.010
So that kind of merging of
moments, events, the fact

00:33:32.010 --> 00:33:34.850
that also it's a generation
that, as you know better than I

00:33:34.850 --> 00:33:37.130
do, lives on the
internet and knows

00:33:37.130 --> 00:33:41.810
internet since they were born--
it was a very natural thing.

00:33:41.810 --> 00:33:43.490
So just sort of like
all these elements

00:33:43.490 --> 00:33:46.080
kind of contributed for
something to happen.

00:33:50.350 --> 00:33:54.370
PROFESSOR: So it
reaches more the youth.

00:33:54.370 --> 00:33:56.750
The authors that we
had to read for today,

00:33:56.750 --> 00:34:03.380
they seem a bit skeptical about
if the social media were really

00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:06.390
motivating people,
mobilizing people.

00:34:06.390 --> 00:34:10.150
There's no doubt that they did,
but what was important of it

00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:14.980
compared to ground-level
organization?

00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.090
And so in the tweets
on the street,

00:34:17.090 --> 00:34:22.100
Gerbaudo mentioned that
it took a few months

00:34:22.100 --> 00:34:27.120
before actually the
Facebook RSVP translated

00:34:27.120 --> 00:34:30.670
into massive physical
attendance in public spaces.

00:34:30.670 --> 00:34:34.934
And also, the DFK
[INAUDIBLE] from Tunisia.

00:34:34.934 --> 00:34:37.350
And he mentioned also that the
Occupy Wall Street Movement

00:34:37.350 --> 00:34:40.469
was not magically born
out of a Twitter hashtag,

00:34:40.469 --> 00:34:42.770
but gained importance
after a slow process

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.280
of ground-level organization.

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.964
So I know it's a tough
question, but do you

00:34:46.964 --> 00:34:48.630
think that the Egyptian
revolution would

00:34:48.630 --> 00:34:52.650
have happened without
the digital technology,

00:34:52.650 --> 00:34:54.420
without social media?

00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:59.060
And or maybe in a more
easy way to answer,

00:34:59.060 --> 00:35:01.380
how important was
the role of Facebook

00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:05.670
in recruiting part spent and
mobilizing people, bringing

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.800
them to Tahrir Square?

00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:10.210
LARA BALADI: I mean, when
it happened-- and this

00:35:10.210 --> 00:35:13.110
is why this image actually
is very important,

00:35:13.110 --> 00:35:15.460
because suddenly there's
this young woman.

00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.700
And she's in front
of the police.

00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:20.520
To see this in an Arab
country was in itself

00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:22.165
an image that shocked people.

00:35:22.165 --> 00:35:24.760
Wow, all these women were at the
front line of the revolution.

00:35:24.760 --> 00:35:26.760
I mean, they weren't just
standing at the back.

00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:28.480
We were actually at the front.

00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:33.910
And so to see that, and to see
that generation kind of come

00:35:33.910 --> 00:35:36.550
out and not want a revolution.

00:35:36.550 --> 00:35:38.500
They didn't come out
asking for a revolution.

00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:42.410
They actually came out
asking for dignity.

00:35:42.410 --> 00:35:47.510
So please stop the
police from abusing us,

00:35:47.510 --> 00:35:49.300
because I don't want
to get into details,

00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:52.130
but most people have been
abused by the police,

00:35:52.130 --> 00:35:54.090
and sometimes sexually
abused by the police.

00:35:54.090 --> 00:35:56.370
So there's a huge
amount of torture

00:35:56.370 --> 00:35:59.690
that came out-- a revelation
about how many instruments

00:35:59.690 --> 00:36:02.490
were hidden into these caves
of all these police stations.

00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:14.700
The context was that you have
to imagine the Khaled Saeed

00:36:14.700 --> 00:36:18.550
case leading to
the Facebook page,

00:36:18.550 --> 00:36:21.670
leading to bringing all this
generation-- essentially

00:36:21.670 --> 00:36:26.710
that generation-- to the
street on the 25 of January.

00:36:26.710 --> 00:36:29.370
That was a very
important moment.

00:36:29.370 --> 00:36:31.710
And yes, it came
out of universities.

00:36:31.710 --> 00:36:35.130
It came out of a new generation
that was kind of like,

00:36:35.130 --> 00:36:38.320
why are these older
people not doing anything?

00:36:38.320 --> 00:36:39.880
What's wrong with them?

00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.130
And very quickly, when the whole
thing turned-- very quickly

00:36:46.130 --> 00:36:47.130
became violence.

00:36:47.130 --> 00:36:48.790
So from the first
night, the police

00:36:48.790 --> 00:36:50.520
attacked all these
demonstrators,

00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:52.360
even though they were
much less in number.

00:36:52.360 --> 00:36:55.720
But they waited, as they
do, because they're cowards.

00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:57.520
They waited until
everybody went home.

00:36:57.520 --> 00:36:58.640
And then they
attacked when there

00:36:58.640 --> 00:36:59.889
was less people in the street.

00:36:59.889 --> 00:37:01.680
So that happens,
usually, at midnight.

00:37:01.680 --> 00:37:04.620
So then this two
days that followed,

00:37:04.620 --> 00:37:08.040
there is more violence that
takes place in the streets.

00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.706
A few people get killed--
the first martyrs

00:37:10.706 --> 00:37:11.455
of the revolution.

00:37:11.455 --> 00:37:16.370
And that sort of stated
a kind of enough.

00:37:16.370 --> 00:37:17.530
Now that's it.

00:37:17.530 --> 00:37:19.550
Those kids went to the streets.

00:37:19.550 --> 00:37:23.270
We adults are actually
cowards for not

00:37:23.270 --> 00:37:24.600
having done what they're doing.

00:37:24.600 --> 00:37:26.250
We've been waiting
for 13 years to even

00:37:26.250 --> 00:37:28.140
have the guts to do that.

00:37:28.140 --> 00:37:29.720
And they kill people.

00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.120
And why?

00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.020
And it's enough.

00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:36.280
And so on that Friday, which
was called the Day of Anger,

00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.510
the whole population went out.

00:37:38.510 --> 00:37:39.927
Everybody went out.

00:37:39.927 --> 00:37:41.760
Every single per-- and
we're talking the day

00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:42.960
where there's no more internet.

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.084
There's no more telephones.

00:37:44.084 --> 00:37:45.180
There's no more anything.

00:37:45.180 --> 00:37:47.960
So everybody went out.

00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:52.207
So yes, there was a trigger
that was associated to Facebook.

00:37:52.207 --> 00:37:54.040
And people called it
the Facebook revolution

00:37:54.040 --> 00:37:56.290
because there was something
really beautiful about it.

00:37:56.290 --> 00:37:58.180
There was people who
were young, people

00:37:58.180 --> 00:38:00.720
who were courageous,
people who died.

00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.160
There was a real
desire for change.

00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:05.260
There was something
very innocent, and very,

00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:11.030
very really very hopeful.

00:38:11.030 --> 00:38:13.830
And the shift
happened very quickly

00:38:13.830 --> 00:38:19.260
when that whole population
followed, but very quickly

00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:22.980
also turned into
who's going to take

00:38:22.980 --> 00:38:24.900
advantage of what's happening?

00:38:24.900 --> 00:38:28.220
So this kind of unfolds
as the revolution unfolds.

00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:33.340
But the role of the social
media at the very beginning

00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:35.810
is really a kind of
trigger and a sign

00:38:35.810 --> 00:38:39.390
that this need for change
comes from this generation that

00:38:39.390 --> 00:38:41.270
wants to have a future.

00:38:41.270 --> 00:38:44.070
But then, everybody
else who is politicized

00:38:44.070 --> 00:38:46.570
and everybody else who
is part of the society

00:38:46.570 --> 00:38:51.650
also has different interest
in things changing or not.

00:38:51.650 --> 00:38:53.640
And so then a lot of
other things happened.

00:38:53.640 --> 00:38:56.740
And then the media,
as we know, also

00:38:56.740 --> 00:38:59.790
take on another role
as everything changes

00:38:59.790 --> 00:39:03.630
every minute, and then every
day, every week, and so on,

00:39:03.630 --> 00:39:05.320
and so forth.

00:39:05.320 --> 00:39:07.440
So yes, it's a very
important role.

00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:11.240
But it doesn't
define the society

00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:15.450
because it's the trigger of
something at the beginning.

00:39:15.450 --> 00:39:22.350
And also it doesn't really--
what this is not addressed also

00:39:22.350 --> 00:39:25.210
in that image-- kind of
utopic image-- of watching

00:39:25.210 --> 00:39:28.660
all these young people working
towards something they're

00:39:28.660 --> 00:39:33.310
dreaming of-- is that most
of the population, especially

00:39:33.310 --> 00:39:35.237
people who are in the
countryside, which

00:39:35.237 --> 00:39:37.070
has been very ignored
during the revolution,

00:39:37.070 --> 00:39:39.630
especially by the
foreign media-- everybody

00:39:39.630 --> 00:39:41.450
was focusing on Tahrir.

00:39:41.450 --> 00:39:43.360
Tahrir is just a
little area in Cairo.

00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.440
It's actually not even that big.

00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:49.360
And yet there's Egypt.

00:39:49.360 --> 00:39:53.255
And Egypt is essentially
countryside and people

00:39:53.255 --> 00:39:57.370
who are peasants, or people
who are workers in the delta.

00:39:57.370 --> 00:40:00.410
So all of these people are
not necessarily connected

00:40:00.410 --> 00:40:01.370
to internet.

00:40:01.370 --> 00:40:02.870
They don't have a Facebook page.

00:40:02.870 --> 00:40:06.560
So two million people signed
up on Facebook in the first 10,

00:40:06.560 --> 00:40:10.160
20 days of when the
internet came back.

00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.190
So I'm one of them.

00:40:15.230 --> 00:40:17.690
So then you have also
this whole relationship

00:40:17.690 --> 00:40:21.390
of how people have focused
on that first moment.

00:40:21.390 --> 00:40:24.670
And it kind of colored
what happened after.

00:40:24.670 --> 00:40:26.600
But no, it's much more
complex than this.

00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:32.540
And the economics of the country
is at the core of the movement.

00:40:32.540 --> 00:40:35.970
The different religions are
at core in the movement.

00:40:35.970 --> 00:40:40.145
There's a lot of other
levels that we can get into.

00:40:40.145 --> 00:40:41.502
But it's not the subject today.

00:40:41.502 --> 00:40:44.270
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
considering the low level

00:40:44.270 --> 00:40:46.060
of internet
connection in Egypt--

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:49.970
there was 25% of the population
connected in 2011, according

00:40:49.970 --> 00:40:53.460
to the statistic that I saw--
and the low alphabetization

00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:58.043
rate-- 65% compared
to 99% in the States.

00:40:58.043 --> 00:40:59.043
And the fact that only--

00:40:59.043 --> 00:41:00.010
LARA BALADI: So you
found that number?

00:41:00.010 --> 00:41:00.590
PROFESSOR: Yeah, but--

00:41:00.590 --> 00:41:01.530
LARA BALADI: That's huge.

00:41:01.530 --> 00:41:02.155
That's amazing.

00:41:02.155 --> 00:41:04.980
PROFESSOR: Well, alphabetization
is something subjective.

00:41:04.980 --> 00:41:08.580
So I'm pretty sure it's not
99% that read very well.

00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:11.540
LARA BALADI: 99 is not bad.

00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:17.030
PROFESSOR: Yeah, I mean, so
it was the one beside the 65%.

00:41:17.030 --> 00:41:21.010
And only 4% of adults were on
Facebook before the revolution,

00:41:21.010 --> 00:41:24.120
so it's not much.

00:41:24.120 --> 00:41:27.130
The question is, how did
the techno-savvy youth

00:41:27.130 --> 00:41:30.500
manage to bridge the digital
gap, the digital divide,

00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.990
during the Arab Spring?

00:41:31.990 --> 00:41:36.730
And were they employing other
techniques, other means,

00:41:36.730 --> 00:41:39.590
to kind of get these
people who were not

00:41:39.590 --> 00:41:42.200
connected on the street?

00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:44.200
LARA BALADI: I think
that's part of the problem,

00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:48.690
is that-- I mean, I
wouldn't associate

00:41:48.690 --> 00:41:51.970
that problem to
necessarily-- people

00:41:51.970 --> 00:41:53.620
were using the tools they have.

00:41:53.620 --> 00:42:00.276
But very quickly, it appeared
that you have community.

00:42:00.276 --> 00:42:02.236
It's a little bit like
being in a university.

00:42:02.236 --> 00:42:03.610
So you have your
group of people.

00:42:03.610 --> 00:42:04.770
You have your community.

00:42:04.770 --> 00:42:07.120
You have those do sports with.

00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.590
You have those you have
the same classes with,

00:42:09.590 --> 00:42:11.290
so on, and so forth.

00:42:11.290 --> 00:42:13.340
And in a way, they start
talking to each other.

00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:16.220
But they're not really
talking to everybody else.

00:42:16.220 --> 00:42:18.370
And so suddenly, when
you start-- anyway,

00:42:18.370 --> 00:42:21.780
I got on Twitter very
early on-- as soon

00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:22.864
as the internet came back.

00:42:22.864 --> 00:42:24.321
Because I didn't
have a television.

00:42:24.321 --> 00:42:26.070
I had to know what
the hell's going on.

00:42:26.070 --> 00:42:27.594
So I tried to figure it out.

00:42:27.594 --> 00:42:29.760
I didn't really like Facebook,
but I was, like, wow,

00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:30.718
Twitter is pretty cool.

00:42:30.718 --> 00:42:32.570
So I really got it very quickly.

00:42:32.570 --> 00:42:35.670
And I got really agitated
on Twitter very quickly.

00:42:35.670 --> 00:42:37.401
And so I'm, like,
OK, who's important?

00:42:37.401 --> 00:42:38.150
Who's saying what?

00:42:38.150 --> 00:42:40.191
So you start following
people, and understanding,

00:42:40.191 --> 00:42:42.691
and kind of mapping
who's the activists here,

00:42:42.691 --> 00:42:44.940
and who's interesting, and
who's saying stupid things,

00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:47.190
and who's saying interesting
things, and who's calling

00:42:47.190 --> 00:42:48.422
for violence, and who's not.

00:42:48.422 --> 00:42:49.630
So it's actually quite funny.

00:42:49.630 --> 00:42:51.629
Because it's like this
whole thing is unfolding.

00:42:51.629 --> 00:42:53.910
And you have all these
characters without face

00:42:53.910 --> 00:42:57.110
that you discover.

00:42:57.110 --> 00:43:02.010
And you become part of
that whole film, in a way.

00:43:02.010 --> 00:43:08.190
And the interesting thing was
that some of those characters

00:43:08.190 --> 00:43:13.070
or activists or
participants were really

00:43:13.070 --> 00:43:20.000
focusing on this
notion of organization

00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:27.480
or this notion of criticizing
or freely talking.

00:43:27.480 --> 00:43:29.400
Because now we could talk.

00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:33.420
But there was no sense
of-- I never felt

00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.910
that they were talking to me.

00:43:34.910 --> 00:43:37.390
They were always kind of
talking to one another,

00:43:37.390 --> 00:43:39.230
like knowing who was on Twitter.

00:43:39.230 --> 00:43:41.790
And they were kind of
talking to each other.

00:43:41.790 --> 00:43:47.490
And then the media, after the
18 days that toppled Mubarak,

00:43:47.490 --> 00:43:50.350
the international media
was much more present

00:43:50.350 --> 00:43:52.646
and able to document
the revolution.

00:43:52.646 --> 00:43:54.270
And of course, the
first thing they did

00:43:54.270 --> 00:43:57.911
is they transformed people
into heroes and icons

00:43:57.911 --> 00:43:58.660
of the revolution.

00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:00.560
And yes, some of them were.

00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:03.340
Some of those
people were amazing.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.970
And they're still amazing.

00:44:04.970 --> 00:44:10.980
But what it did is that
it kind of intensified

00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:14.870
the sort of ego of
some of these people.

00:44:14.870 --> 00:44:18.990
And it intensified their
importance in a movement,

00:44:18.990 --> 00:44:23.250
and kind of blurred the actual
reasons why this was happening,

00:44:23.250 --> 00:44:25.080
and kind of almost
disconnected them

00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:27.790
from the rest of the society.

00:44:27.790 --> 00:44:31.680
And one of the big criticisms
of that generation,

00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:35.900
whether it was in Alex, in Suez,
or in Cairo-- doesn't matter--

00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:40.090
was that nobody was
addressing the countryside.

00:44:40.090 --> 00:44:43.290
Nobody was addressing the
[INAUDIBLE] around Cairo.

00:44:43.290 --> 00:44:46.650
Nobody was addressing the
actual role of all these people

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:48.730
outside of Tahrir.

00:44:48.730 --> 00:44:50.800
Go down the street,
and go to another area.

00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:51.960
And see what's going on.

00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:54.540
So this became
really problematic,

00:44:54.540 --> 00:45:00.420
because the way the focus
became so about the square

00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:05.070
and so much about some of
these important activists,

00:45:05.070 --> 00:45:07.480
it also created a
kind of disconnection

00:45:07.480 --> 00:45:09.520
with the rest of
the communities.

00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:12.960
And as young people are--
they're very passionate

00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:17.040
and they're very radical, and
sometimes a little bit blinded

00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:22.540
by their passion-- so they tend
to kind of obscure themselves

00:45:22.540 --> 00:45:25.800
from the possibilities
that-- to be strong,

00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:28.040
they need to have
people on their side.

00:45:28.040 --> 00:45:29.540
And I think one of
the big mistakes

00:45:29.540 --> 00:45:32.070
was that they were
so, so radical

00:45:32.070 --> 00:45:36.550
and believed so much and in
a certain way for democracy

00:45:36.550 --> 00:45:39.140
to be implemented
that anybody who

00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:43.710
didn't believe the same thing,
they kind of dismissed them.

00:45:43.710 --> 00:45:45.190
What they forgot
to do is that they

00:45:45.190 --> 00:45:47.530
didn't realize that who
they were dismissing

00:45:47.530 --> 00:45:50.340
were actually the majority
of people in Egypt.

00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:52.530
And so to lose the
majority of people in Egypt

00:45:52.530 --> 00:45:55.440
is also what got us
to where we are today.

00:45:55.440 --> 00:46:02.310
And that majority said, enough
of this bullshit or mess

00:46:02.310 --> 00:46:03.930
in the street that's happening.

00:46:03.930 --> 00:46:08.730
And let's go back with at least
having our military regime

00:46:08.730 --> 00:46:11.020
taking care of security.

00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:15.430
So I think that was one
of the big mistakes,

00:46:15.430 --> 00:46:17.960
is that you throw
yourself into a movement,

00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:21.420
but then you forget to
bring people in with you.

00:46:21.420 --> 00:46:23.360
PROFESSOR: Do you
think-- I read that there

00:46:23.360 --> 00:46:26.600
were some tactics to
kind of agitate people

00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:28.610
with face-to-face relation.

00:46:28.610 --> 00:46:30.320
Like people were
going in the street,

00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:35.510
and there were some regimen
points at different places

00:46:35.510 --> 00:46:37.800
in working neighborhoods.

00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.570
And people were meeting
there, and then they

00:46:41.570 --> 00:46:43.390
were going down
the street chanting

00:46:43.390 --> 00:46:46.340
slogans, positive
slogans, to kind of drive

00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:50.620
more people with them walking
towards Tahrir Square.

00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.340
Do you think that
these kind of tactics

00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:56.340
are more efficient than the
Facebook or the digital media

00:46:56.340 --> 00:46:56.980
tactics?

00:46:56.980 --> 00:46:59.030
Or it's kind of a
combination of both

00:46:59.030 --> 00:47:03.480
that makes it more-- that
allowed to reach more

00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.220
people, more diverse crowd?

00:47:06.220 --> 00:47:09.870
LARA BALADI: I think it's all
of-- it's everything together.

00:47:09.870 --> 00:47:12.840
It's almost like
it's something--

00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:15.680
you have to imagine it
like something climaxing.

00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.350
So you have all these
things happening,

00:47:18.350 --> 00:47:20.930
but you're not really aware,
maybe, that they're happening.

00:47:20.930 --> 00:47:23.410
But suddenly, everybody finds
themselves in the same place

00:47:23.410 --> 00:47:25.260
and things collide.

00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.630
And it's that explosion
that's actually incredible.

00:47:28.630 --> 00:47:34.530
And that creates that
fascinating time that we lived.

00:47:34.530 --> 00:47:36.140
And so it's a combination.

00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.000
It's like a timing.

00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.570
It's like a moment where
everybody was ready.

00:47:40.570 --> 00:47:42.490
There's maybe some
[INAUDIBLE] I don't know.

00:47:42.490 --> 00:47:44.040
But who knows.

00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:49.050
But there was a real kind
of an invisible march

00:47:49.050 --> 00:47:51.310
towards that time.

00:47:51.310 --> 00:47:55.020
And the tactics that where
you were-- of course,

00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:56.250
they started on Facebook.

00:47:56.250 --> 00:48:01.460
As [INAUDIBLE] Facebook,
which I find out later,

00:48:01.460 --> 00:48:03.660
prepares people for
the 25th of January,

00:48:03.660 --> 00:48:07.890
saying, go down with an
onion in your pocket,

00:48:07.890 --> 00:48:13.960
with a bottle of vinegar,
and with a mask if you can.

00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.010
And so I found myself
in Tahrir on the Friday,

00:48:18.010 --> 00:48:20.960
on the Day of Anger at
10:00 in the morning.

00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.490
I didn't even know
there was marches

00:48:22.490 --> 00:48:24.665
going from these
mosques and all this.

00:48:24.665 --> 00:48:27.995
And I just knew everybody
was going to meet in Tahrir.

00:48:27.995 --> 00:48:30.690
But I didn't realize there was
a kind of movement that was

00:48:30.690 --> 00:48:33.570
going to actually take place.

00:48:33.570 --> 00:48:37.700
So I go before
everybody, very early.

00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:41.460
Which means that I find myself
in the center of the city

00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:45.530
where then, few hours later,
there's already demonstrations.

00:48:45.530 --> 00:48:47.970
So people are marching
up and down the streets.

00:48:47.970 --> 00:48:50.235
And there's already these
groups of people kind

00:48:50.235 --> 00:48:55.450
of occupying the main streets
of the area around Tahrir.

00:48:55.450 --> 00:48:58.990
And there's police kind of
blocking the entrance to Tahrir

00:48:58.990 --> 00:49:02.370
from the outskirts of the city,
of the center of the city.

00:49:02.370 --> 00:49:06.280
And all these marches kind
of come towards the center,

00:49:06.280 --> 00:49:08.330
and of course,
confront the police.

00:49:08.330 --> 00:49:09.280
But I'm also inside.

00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.270
So I'm confronting the
police from inside.

00:49:11.270 --> 00:49:12.971
It's like a big mess.

00:49:12.971 --> 00:49:15.359
And it's really funny.

00:49:15.359 --> 00:49:17.650
Because suddenly, I'm, like,
what the hell is going on?

00:49:17.650 --> 00:49:20.115
And then boom-- tear gas.

00:49:20.115 --> 00:49:20.830
It's horrible.

00:49:20.830 --> 00:49:22.705
I don't know if you've
experienced it before.

00:49:22.705 --> 00:49:26.345
But you start really coughing
and everything hurts.

00:49:26.345 --> 00:49:29.550
And it's really itchy and so on.

00:49:29.550 --> 00:49:32.650
And some guy next to you
will give you vinegar

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:34.650
and you wash your
face with vinegar.

00:49:34.650 --> 00:49:37.820
And so it's all these
tactics that were

00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:39.882
shared on the Facebook page.

00:49:39.882 --> 00:49:41.340
But then when you're
on the street,

00:49:41.340 --> 00:49:42.690
you're dealing with the street.

00:49:42.690 --> 00:49:43.963
You have to react quickly.

00:49:43.963 --> 00:49:46.030
And you have to hide
when you have to hide.

00:49:46.030 --> 00:49:51.790
And you have to understand
violence very quickly,

00:49:51.790 --> 00:49:54.000
and understand where you
stand in all of this.

00:49:54.000 --> 00:50:02.330
So it's a mix of always adapting
and having people with you

00:50:02.330 --> 00:50:04.040
that everybody
supports each other.

00:50:04.040 --> 00:50:05.900
So there's a real
solidarity that's

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:07.440
very natural that takes place.

00:50:07.440 --> 00:50:09.210
Because when you have
a very clear enemy,

00:50:09.210 --> 00:50:12.240
it's very easy to be
friends with your neighbor.

00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:14.390
When you're not sure
who the enemy is,

00:50:14.390 --> 00:50:16.960
then everybody's
your enemy, in a way.

00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:19.950
So it's a very interesting
time, because it's

00:50:19.950 --> 00:50:21.830
very clear who the enemy is.

00:50:21.830 --> 00:50:25.505
And so the energy and
the kind of togetherness

00:50:25.505 --> 00:50:28.030
is incredibly strong.

00:50:28.030 --> 00:50:36.250
And so methods of responding
to the very fast-changing times

00:50:36.250 --> 00:50:38.340
that we're living
in those 18 days,

00:50:38.340 --> 00:50:40.980
and then a bit
slower as times goes

00:50:40.980 --> 00:50:44.850
in the aftermath of
Tahrir, is all about people

00:50:44.850 --> 00:50:47.070
finding solutions to everything.

00:50:47.070 --> 00:50:49.230
And those solutions
are shared on Twitter.

00:50:49.230 --> 00:50:51.360
They're in the street.

00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:53.940
And maybe you can
show-- I don't know

00:50:53.940 --> 00:50:58.460
where it is in the sildeshow,
but the way Tahrir [INAUDIBLE].

00:50:58.460 --> 00:50:59.870
PROFESSOR: I have photo of this.

00:50:59.870 --> 00:51:02.832
LARA BALADI: Yes,
here, the camp.

00:51:02.832 --> 00:51:05.520
Can you do it to slideshow?

00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:10.040
So this is an image
of [INAUDIBLE]

00:51:10.040 --> 00:51:11.820
and how it was organized.

00:51:11.820 --> 00:51:15.040
And so at the center
of it, under the tents,

00:51:15.040 --> 00:51:19.290
you have the blogger
tent, the media tent.

00:51:19.290 --> 00:51:23.280
Then you have an area where you
have the medical part, where

00:51:23.280 --> 00:51:26.310
people who were hurt were being
helped by whoever's a doctor,

00:51:26.310 --> 00:51:28.520
was actually sudden
improvise themselves

00:51:28.520 --> 00:51:30.670
as making a hospital.

00:51:30.670 --> 00:51:33.460
And the space in the square
where people could be taken

00:51:33.460 --> 00:51:34.350
care of.

00:51:34.350 --> 00:51:36.160
On Twitter you
would have suddenly

00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:43.690
hashtags of medical supplies and
Tahrir Square-- different types

00:51:43.690 --> 00:51:48.470
of names and people improvising
accounts, but also organizing

00:51:48.470 --> 00:51:49.570
in little groups.

00:51:49.570 --> 00:51:51.530
And saying if you're
going to bring something,

00:51:51.530 --> 00:51:54.130
bring it-- let's focus.

00:51:54.130 --> 00:51:58.202
Not everybody brings band-aids.

00:51:58.202 --> 00:52:00.410
If you want to bring something,
this is what we need.

00:52:00.410 --> 00:52:01.110
This is what we need.

00:52:01.110 --> 00:52:02.151
And this is what we need.

00:52:02.151 --> 00:52:03.350
And this is where we are.

00:52:03.350 --> 00:52:05.490
And so you can
start helping people

00:52:05.490 --> 00:52:07.120
by following what's going on.

00:52:07.120 --> 00:52:13.450
So it's a combination of street
intelligence and communication

00:52:13.450 --> 00:52:16.750
online, and communication
between people.

00:52:16.750 --> 00:52:22.650
So it's a very fast-moving
time and vary fascinating,

00:52:22.650 --> 00:52:25.062
because it really plays
out on so many layers.

00:52:25.062 --> 00:52:26.770
PROFESSOR: There's
kind of an interaction

00:52:26.770 --> 00:52:29.420
between organizing
on the ground,

00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:32.670
organizing in the social media.

00:52:32.670 --> 00:52:34.710
I want to switch
subject and talk

00:52:34.710 --> 00:52:36.360
a bit about the
role of social media

00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:40.930
for bringing the world
attention to the cause.

00:52:40.930 --> 00:52:43.930
There's no doubt that Facebook,
YouTube, Flickr, Twitter

00:52:43.930 --> 00:52:47.700
facilitated the citizen
journalism, helped

00:52:47.700 --> 00:52:49.720
desseminating the news,
showing the police

00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.400
brutality to the
world, eliciting

00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:55.000
international attention.

00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.830
And similarly, the activists
involved in the Occupy Movement

00:52:57.830 --> 00:53:00.400
creatively used social media
and cutting-edge technology

00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:02.660
like live streaming
to kind of bring

00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:06.670
the world attention to the
encampment and to the cause

00:53:06.670 --> 00:53:08.170
itself.

00:53:08.170 --> 00:53:10.210
And both movements
really managed

00:53:10.210 --> 00:53:13.410
to secure an impressive
degree of public support.

00:53:13.410 --> 00:53:15.710
In your article, "When
Seeing is Belonging"--

00:53:15.710 --> 00:53:16.830
I'm referring to it a lot.

00:53:16.830 --> 00:53:18.260
I really liked it.

00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.870
You mentioned that the
image of Tahrir Square

00:53:20.870 --> 00:53:23.680
circulating on the
web and in the news,

00:53:23.680 --> 00:53:27.780
and I quote, "Turn all
established cliches of Egypt

00:53:27.780 --> 00:53:29.160
on their heads."

00:53:29.160 --> 00:53:31.650
And I really like this idea.

00:53:31.650 --> 00:53:34.750
And I would like to ask you how
exactly did these images change

00:53:34.750 --> 00:53:37.590
the world perception of Egypt?

00:53:37.590 --> 00:53:41.040
LARA BALADI: It feels so
old already, and sadly so,

00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:42.860
because of what's
happening now with ISIS

00:53:42.860 --> 00:53:45.102
and all this horrible stuff.

00:53:45.102 --> 00:53:47.910
But at the time,
if you remember,

00:53:47.910 --> 00:53:52.010
2011-- this is like
10 years after 9/11.

00:53:52.010 --> 00:53:54.630
And there's been this
whole War on Terror

00:53:54.630 --> 00:53:58.150
and this whole really-- I
mean, it's not new from 9/11,

00:53:58.150 --> 00:53:59.540
but it's multiplied.

00:53:59.540 --> 00:54:03.170
And it grew
exponentially after 9/11,

00:54:03.170 --> 00:54:07.440
that whole visible
of the Arab world,

00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:11.835
and putting everybody
into an Arab

00:54:11.835 --> 00:54:13.750
is a Muslim and
Muslim is a terrorist.

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:16.450
And it's like this
kind of generalization

00:54:16.450 --> 00:54:19.560
of what the Arab world is.

00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:23.590
So one of the cliches was-- I
should have put this picture,

00:54:23.590 --> 00:54:27.890
but it doesn't matter--
but one of the first things

00:54:27.890 --> 00:54:30.140
that kind of comes
up is suddenly,

00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:34.830
the dirty Arab-- the
terrorists-- is not a terrorist

00:54:34.830 --> 00:54:35.330
anymore.

00:54:35.330 --> 00:54:37.020
He's actually a revolutionary.

00:54:37.020 --> 00:54:39.020
And he's working for
peace in the world.

00:54:39.020 --> 00:54:42.220
And he wants change and
he wakes everybody up.

00:54:42.220 --> 00:54:44.890
The whole world was stuck
to their television looking

00:54:44.890 --> 00:54:45.800
at Tahrir.

00:54:45.800 --> 00:54:48.330
It was one of the
most [INAUDIBLE],

00:54:48.330 --> 00:54:50.580
and still is until today.

00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:54.180
So that was one thing.

00:54:54.180 --> 00:54:58.930
Then, if you remember, there was
the Wisconsin actually happened

00:54:58.930 --> 00:55:00.360
more [INAUDIBLE] time of Tahrir.

00:55:00.360 --> 00:55:03.540
And one of the funniest
images that came out

00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:08.330
was this woman holding a
banner saying, Egypt, help us.

00:55:08.330 --> 00:55:12.940
So from America being very
anti-Arabs and anti-terrorists

00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:17.630
and anti- anything that
comes out of the Arab world,

00:55:17.630 --> 00:55:19.900
you have this kind of
like calling for help

00:55:19.900 --> 00:55:22.490
from-- we actually are friends.

00:55:22.490 --> 00:55:23.735
And we think the same way.

00:55:23.735 --> 00:55:26.530
And we discovered that
maybe we can get along.

00:55:26.530 --> 00:55:28.320
So this was really interesting.

00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:31.720
And of course, to go back to
photography, and to my interest

00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:33.300
as an artist and
the medium that I

00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:40.180
use in making images, what
happens-- not so much in the 18

00:55:40.180 --> 00:55:44.810
days as much as
just after 18 days,

00:55:44.810 --> 00:55:49.980
the whole period, the aftermath
after Mubarak is toppled

00:55:49.980 --> 00:55:55.310
is also to watch
how I've experienced

00:55:55.310 --> 00:55:57.942
Egypt all my life
as a kid, and all

00:55:57.942 --> 00:56:03.925
my life as an adult
with this relationship

00:56:03.925 --> 00:56:07.860
it has with the West,
and with tourism,

00:56:07.860 --> 00:56:11.370
and how Egypt has always
been a place where-- I'm sure

00:56:11.370 --> 00:56:13.732
all of you have
studied ancient Egypt

00:56:13.732 --> 00:56:15.440
when you were 11 years
old, more or less.

00:56:15.440 --> 00:56:18.800
So that's in every
schoolbook in the world,

00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:21.897
you have ancient Egypt more or
less at the age of nine or 11,

00:56:21.897 --> 00:56:22.730
something like this.

00:56:22.730 --> 00:56:25.447
So it's the first
fascination with the world.

00:56:25.447 --> 00:56:26.780
And it's the first civilization.

00:56:26.780 --> 00:56:29.670
And everybody wants
to see the Pyramids.

00:56:29.670 --> 00:56:30.570
But here we go.

00:56:30.570 --> 00:56:31.920
We're like, we have Tahrir.

00:56:31.920 --> 00:56:35.090
And this pyramids, which
here is not a cliche.

00:56:35.090 --> 00:56:37.590
It's actually another way of
looking at the Pyramids-- which

00:56:37.590 --> 00:56:42.310
itself takes away the cliche
of the idea that these Pyramids

00:56:42.310 --> 00:56:48.450
are unobtainable-- gets
replaced by the birds-eye view

00:56:48.450 --> 00:56:51.160
of Tahrir.

00:56:51.160 --> 00:56:53.700
And after the 18 days,
you start watching

00:56:53.700 --> 00:57:00.720
all of these Western people that
come and do tourism in Tahrir,

00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:02.340
and don't want to
see the revolution,

00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.520
want to be part of it.

00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:05.200
So you have people
who are activists.

00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:09.479
You have people who
are just people who are

00:57:09.479 --> 00:57:10.770
fascinated by what's happening.

00:57:10.770 --> 00:57:11.894
They want to be part of it.

00:57:11.894 --> 00:57:12.672
They just come.

00:57:12.672 --> 00:57:15.660
And so you see this new
kind of tourism evolve,

00:57:15.660 --> 00:57:21.870
and Egypt becoming associated
with the revolution, Tahrir,

00:57:21.870 --> 00:57:23.984
people, et cetera, et cetera.

00:57:23.984 --> 00:57:25.650
And no one's talking
about the Pyramids.

00:57:25.650 --> 00:57:28.570
I'm not even sure anybody's
even going to see them.

00:57:28.570 --> 00:57:30.275
And I'm not sure how
long that's going

00:57:30.275 --> 00:57:32.030
to take for them to come back.

00:57:32.030 --> 00:57:35.620
But I think it's a very
interesting sort of shift,

00:57:35.620 --> 00:57:40.710
and how overnight, that image
that's been there for centuries

00:57:40.710 --> 00:57:46.600
gets kind of deleted, and
replaced by this other Egypt

00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:48.370
that we're in the
middle of at the moment.

00:57:48.370 --> 00:57:52.281
PROFESSOR: I will definitely
visit Tahrir Square if I go.

00:57:52.281 --> 00:57:54.030
LARA BALADI: You'll
be sadly disappointed,

00:57:54.030 --> 00:57:57.737
but I can still take
you to the Pyramids.

00:57:57.737 --> 00:57:59.320
PROFESSOR: All right,
I'd like to talk

00:57:59.320 --> 00:58:02.250
a little bit about the role of
social media as an alternative

00:58:02.250 --> 00:58:06.980
to commercial media.

00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:11.620
Earlier in the
semester, we learned

00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:14.250
that a few media companies own
the majority of the world's

00:58:14.250 --> 00:58:15.140
media outlets.

00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:18.620
And with Herman
and Chomsky, we saw

00:58:18.620 --> 00:58:21.210
that this was a problem,
like a threat to democracy,

00:58:21.210 --> 00:58:24.410
because the mass media tend
to construct a worldview that

00:58:24.410 --> 00:58:27.660
conforms to the need of
corporate advertisement,

00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:30.090
valorising some
political perspective

00:58:30.090 --> 00:58:33.250
and marginalizing
other perspectives.

00:58:33.250 --> 00:58:36.700
And in this context, a lot of
people see internet as a space

00:58:36.700 --> 00:58:39.550
where counter-hegemonic point
of view can be expressed.

00:58:39.550 --> 00:58:41.370
And in countries like
Egypt, the situation

00:58:41.370 --> 00:58:42.940
is even worse,
since the media are

00:58:42.940 --> 00:58:47.050
controlled by the government
and subjected to censorship.

00:58:47.050 --> 00:58:49.920
Actually, that's more a
question than an affirmation.

00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:54.020
How biased was the Egyptian
coverage of the revolution?

00:58:54.020 --> 00:58:56.810
And to what extent all
these events happening

00:58:56.810 --> 00:59:00.875
were censored by the regime
in the mass media in Egypt?

00:59:03.610 --> 00:59:06.217
LARA BALADI: I want to
maybe answer this and look

00:59:06.217 --> 00:59:09.180
a little bit-- can we
come out of the slideshow

00:59:09.180 --> 00:59:10.790
so we see a little bit?

00:59:10.790 --> 00:59:24.220
[INAUDIBLE] So
yeah, it's a joke.

00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:26.730
It's propaganda, but old-style.

00:59:26.730 --> 00:59:27.930
It's like grotesque.

00:59:27.930 --> 00:59:29.750
Grotesque-- you know that word?

00:59:29.750 --> 00:59:37.650
So it's really ridiculously--
it's one big lie.

00:59:37.650 --> 00:59:42.000
And it's sadly almost funny.

00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.140
It's dark humor at that point.

00:59:45.140 --> 00:59:48.080
And when the revolution
starts, nothing really changes.

00:59:48.080 --> 00:59:50.070
I mean, actually
people who did not

00:59:50.070 --> 00:59:52.910
want to continue to
participate to that lie

00:59:52.910 --> 00:59:59.140
left their jobs at
the state media.

00:59:59.140 --> 01:00:03.684
And the state media continues
to have a huge amount of power,

01:00:03.684 --> 01:00:05.350
because of what I was
saying earlier, is

01:00:05.350 --> 01:00:07.290
that most people actually
don't have internet.

01:00:07.290 --> 01:00:10.600
A lot of people do, but a
lot of people still don't.

01:00:10.600 --> 01:00:12.720
And a lot of people
believe in their army.

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.690
I mean, why we're back
in the military regime

01:00:14.690 --> 01:00:16.980
is because Egypt has
a relationship that's

01:00:16.980 --> 01:00:19.480
a little bit incestuous
with their army.

01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:23.390
We have an army
that is not really

01:00:23.390 --> 01:00:26.270
that interested in keeping
the country protected

01:00:26.270 --> 01:00:30.240
from potential external enemies,
as much as we have an army that

01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:33.320
is there to control us.

01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.900
But that army is made of us.

01:00:35.900 --> 01:00:39.060
So every single family in
Egypt has at least two or three

01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.190
people that are in the army.

01:00:41.190 --> 01:00:45.560
So nobody wants their army to
be at war, either with them

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.020
or with anybody
else, because that

01:00:47.020 --> 01:00:48.490
would be their
son, their father,

01:00:48.490 --> 01:00:52.700
their brother could
be endangered.

01:00:52.700 --> 01:00:56.040
However, the army and the
regime control the media.

01:00:56.040 --> 01:00:59.650
And so at one point in the
evolution of the events,

01:00:59.650 --> 01:01:03.570
and the continuation of the
role of the army post-Mubarak

01:01:03.570 --> 01:01:07.590
being toppled-- so we go
from Mubarak to having

01:01:07.590 --> 01:01:10.930
the rule of the SCAF--
the Supreme Council

01:01:10.930 --> 01:01:14.790
of Armed Forces,
which is the army.

01:01:14.790 --> 01:01:20.150
We have a whole series of
events that take place.

01:01:20.150 --> 01:01:23.920
And one of them is a
very terrible massacre

01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:28.970
that happens in October, 2011
in front of the state media--

01:01:28.970 --> 01:01:34.760
Maspero-- this huge building
that is on the Nile in Cairo,

01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:37.776
where the media is broadcasted.

01:01:37.776 --> 01:01:41.960
And there's a
demonstration because a lot

01:01:41.960 --> 01:01:44.560
of-- at the time, a lot
of Christian churches

01:01:44.560 --> 01:01:45.470
are being attacked.

01:01:45.470 --> 01:01:47.140
This is a period for
months and months

01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:48.970
and months where we don't
have police in the country,

01:01:48.970 --> 01:01:50.210
in the city, and nowhere.

01:01:50.210 --> 01:01:51.730
So we were very happy, actually.

01:01:51.730 --> 01:01:54.690
But there was still a
lot of little crime,

01:01:54.690 --> 01:01:57.480
given that there is no police.

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.880
So of course there
is going to be crime.

01:01:59.880 --> 01:02:05.700
But these crimes
happening in upper Egypt

01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:09.430
lead to these demonstrations
to ask for the Supreme

01:02:09.430 --> 01:02:12.360
Council of Armed Forces to
protect the Christians in Egypt

01:02:12.360 --> 01:02:14.000
who are a minority.

01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.810
That demonstration leads to
the army actually rolling

01:02:18.810 --> 01:02:20.270
over people.

01:02:20.270 --> 01:02:24.730
And the whole
thing is atrocious.

01:02:24.730 --> 01:02:26.074
People get rolled over.

01:02:26.074 --> 01:02:27.490
The photos-- I
can't even tell you

01:02:27.490 --> 01:02:30.320
the horrible photos that
surfaced on Facebook

01:02:30.320 --> 01:02:32.540
and whatever.

01:02:32.540 --> 01:02:33.940
Lots of people died.

01:02:33.940 --> 01:02:35.980
It was really, really ugly.

01:02:35.980 --> 01:02:40.790
And of course, the army
goes on TV and says,

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:43.740
oh, but we don't
use live ammunition.

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.380
We don't actually
use live ammunition.

01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:47.410
We didn't do anything.

01:02:47.410 --> 01:02:54.350
And so this graffiti
says [ARABIC] liars.

01:02:54.350 --> 01:03:00.500
And it has the army cap.

01:03:00.500 --> 01:03:05.220
So [ARABIC] becomes
a movement where

01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:07.830
people do sort of
video flash mobs

01:03:07.830 --> 01:03:12.720
in the streets projecting
videos of martyrs and others

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.430
at very impromptu
moments in the street,

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:17.600
saying the army is lying to you.

01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.360
And this is in a
popular area of Cairo.

01:03:21.360 --> 01:03:23.590
PROFESSOR: And what
about the American media?

01:03:23.590 --> 01:03:27.830
Because we saw in the course
that the American media tend

01:03:27.830 --> 01:03:30.600
to be very biased,
especially when

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:32.150
they cover
international politics.

01:03:32.150 --> 01:03:35.790
And we know that the States were
supporting the Mubarak regime

01:03:35.790 --> 01:03:38.400
to a certain extent
before the revolution.

01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:42.775
So were the American media
also biased, very biased,

01:03:42.775 --> 01:03:45.420
or where they more fair
during the revolution?

01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:47.860
LARA BALADI: I don't
know if [ARABIC] is--

01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.463
what [ARABIC] is-- this one.

01:03:50.463 --> 01:03:53.309
Do you know what this child is?

01:03:53.309 --> 01:03:55.100
PROFESSOR: Anybody
recognize where this is?

01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:55.670
LARA BALADI: I'm not sure
where is it from, but--

01:03:55.670 --> 01:03:57.017
AUDIENCE: It's Russia.

01:03:57.017 --> 01:03:58.100
LARA BALADI: It is, right?

01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:03.014
So this is quite funny,
because with your text.

01:04:03.014 --> 01:04:05.180
PROFESSOR: Let's talk about
the role of social media

01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.460
in organizing the protests.

01:04:07.460 --> 01:04:10.870
So we often refer
to-- the scholars

01:04:10.870 --> 01:04:13.720
often refer to social media
as a means to coordinate

01:04:13.720 --> 01:04:15.940
gatherings, road
blockage, protests,

01:04:15.940 --> 01:04:19.190
other forms of actions on the
ground during the Arab Spring

01:04:19.190 --> 01:04:20.610
and the Occupy Movement.

01:04:20.610 --> 01:04:23.880
Apparently Facebook was used
to set the date of events.

01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:26.720
Twitter was used to connect
people across distance

01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.840
and to share logistics
in real time.

01:04:28.840 --> 01:04:31.800
As you said earlier, you have
to react quickly on the ground.

01:04:31.800 --> 01:04:35.662
So sometimes Twitter was saying
this is the rallying point.

01:04:35.662 --> 01:04:37.370
This is the location
where the police is.

01:04:37.370 --> 01:04:39.800
This is the things
we need, the medicine

01:04:39.800 --> 01:04:44.290
we need for-- because
there were people injured.

01:04:44.290 --> 01:04:47.410
And Gerbaudo uses the
expression "choreography

01:04:47.410 --> 01:04:50.400
of assembly" to describe
the role of social media

01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.400
in facilitating the
physical assembly of highly

01:04:53.400 --> 01:04:57.240
dispersed individuals, as
well as the scene setting

01:04:57.240 --> 01:05:00.010
and scripting.

01:05:00.010 --> 01:05:05.400
So how did you use, yourself,
the social media as a means

01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.630
to organize your day,
where you're going to go,

01:05:08.630 --> 01:05:12.220
what you're going to do
during the revolution?

01:05:12.220 --> 01:05:14.245
LARA BALADI: I mean,
again, I wasn't

01:05:14.245 --> 01:05:15.730
a Facebook, Twitter person.

01:05:15.730 --> 01:05:19.370
So I was using it more to kind
of know what was going on,

01:05:19.370 --> 01:05:24.140
and to make sure I wouldn't
miss something dangerous

01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:26.090
or something I
should know about.

01:05:26.090 --> 01:05:30.990
So it was very-- and
actually, for a little while,

01:05:30.990 --> 01:05:32.550
I always felt a little bit late.

01:05:32.550 --> 01:05:34.390
Like, I always felt
like I'm really

01:05:34.390 --> 01:05:36.910
sure what's going on here.

01:05:36.910 --> 01:05:40.175
I spent a lot of time
trying to make sense of it.

01:05:40.175 --> 01:05:42.410
And in retrospect,
talking to people,

01:05:42.410 --> 01:05:44.250
everybody was in
that same situation.

01:05:44.250 --> 01:05:46.430
Because no one really was
expecting this to happen.

01:05:46.430 --> 01:05:50.560
So everyone was trying to figure
out who was who in all of this.

01:05:50.560 --> 01:05:52.230
Who's doing this, actually?

01:05:52.230 --> 01:05:55.750
Is there somebody doing this,
or where is this coming from?

01:05:55.750 --> 01:06:01.920
So there was a sense of
first understanding minute

01:06:01.920 --> 01:06:04.110
by minute where you stand.

01:06:04.110 --> 01:06:06.030
Because this is
also where I live.

01:06:06.030 --> 01:06:06.870
This is my life.

01:06:06.870 --> 01:06:10.940
So for four years, I lived in
the middle of-- I mean, one

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:17.820
night, one day-- I don't
know what time it was.

01:06:17.820 --> 01:06:20.540
It was maybe 11:00
PM or something.

01:06:20.540 --> 01:06:24.900
And I live-- the Nile
is not so far from me.

01:06:24.900 --> 01:06:26.680
And on the other
side of the Nile

01:06:26.680 --> 01:06:29.540
is a whole area that
is called Imbabah.

01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:30.670
And it's a popular area.

01:06:30.670 --> 01:06:34.230
It very, very, populated.

01:06:34.230 --> 01:06:35.830
And Cairo is 7 million people.

01:06:35.830 --> 01:06:40.210
So it's a very, very dense
population and dense city.

01:06:40.210 --> 01:06:43.660
And I live in an area where
there's a lot embassies

01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:45.090
and schools.

01:06:45.090 --> 01:06:48.770
And it's between two
branches of the Nile.

01:06:48.770 --> 01:06:51.105
And so on one side is
Tahrir and on the other side

01:06:51.105 --> 01:06:52.520
is other areas of Cairo.

01:06:52.520 --> 01:06:54.220
So I could walk to Tahrir.

01:06:54.220 --> 01:06:57.110
But at the same time,
I was across the Nile.

01:06:57.110 --> 01:07:01.450
So there was a sense of,
also a feeling of security.

01:07:01.450 --> 01:07:02.990
People actually
moved back to where

01:07:02.990 --> 01:07:05.542
I lived, because it was
almost the safest place to be

01:07:05.542 --> 01:07:08.420
in Cairo, in that period.

01:07:08.420 --> 01:07:11.080
But all of a sudden
at 11:00 PM, I get up.

01:07:11.080 --> 01:07:13.220
And I'm, like, what the
hell is going on here?

01:07:13.220 --> 01:07:16.560
And I look down at every
window from my house.

01:07:16.560 --> 01:07:18.440
And I've never seen this.

01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:25.030
All these tanks are just driving
super-fast in every street,

01:07:25.030 --> 01:07:27.380
and heading towards this area.

01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.700
And I mean, this was never seen.

01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:31.610
You never saw this.

01:07:31.610 --> 01:07:35.290
Or wake up in the morning
and go to my kitchen.

01:07:35.290 --> 01:07:37.390
And I'm about to go to Tahrir.

01:07:37.390 --> 01:07:39.150
It's really early.

01:07:39.150 --> 01:07:40.580
We're still in the 18 days.

01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:44.240
And I look at my window,
like, what's going on here?

01:07:44.240 --> 01:07:48.370
And I see the building across
the Nile that is burning.

01:07:48.370 --> 01:07:49.840
So this whole area is burning.

01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:51.090
And that was the Day of Anger.

01:07:51.090 --> 01:07:53.700
Also, the following days
after the Day of Anger,

01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:55.880
everything had been
looted and so on.

01:07:55.880 --> 01:08:02.124
So it was constantly like
negotiating the danger zones,

01:08:02.124 --> 01:08:04.540
the moments where you should
be in the street, the moments

01:08:04.540 --> 01:08:09.140
where you shouldn't, what you're
ready to go through or not.

01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:12.490
I wasn't necessarily
ready to get killed.

01:08:12.490 --> 01:08:15.040
It wasn't really-- I don't think
it was a smart thing to do.

01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:20.689
So for me, Twitter,
much more than Facebook,

01:08:20.689 --> 01:08:25.180
was really a way of making
sure I would know what

01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:28.920
the kind of tension-- where we
were at in the tension scale.

01:08:28.920 --> 01:08:31.350
And so it was very interesting,
because I was always

01:08:31.350 --> 01:08:32.069
in the Square.

01:08:32.069 --> 01:08:35.321
But I also always was
aware that, oh, the army's

01:08:35.321 --> 01:08:36.279
coming in half an hour.

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:37.653
We're going to
get into a battle.

01:08:37.653 --> 01:08:39.819
Tonight, there's
going to be a sucker.

01:08:39.819 --> 01:08:41.279
And this would happen.

01:08:41.279 --> 01:08:43.819
So before this would
happen, I would just go home

01:08:43.819 --> 01:08:46.880
and say, I'm not going
to get into this.

01:08:46.880 --> 01:08:48.890
So it was really
interesting to watch also

01:08:48.890 --> 01:08:50.485
that movement on that.

01:08:50.485 --> 01:08:54.069
But it was also very confusing,
because some people were also

01:08:54.069 --> 01:09:00.370
acting from the spur of the
moment and a bit of hysteria.

01:09:00.370 --> 01:09:01.819
And so not everything was real.

01:09:01.819 --> 01:09:04.050
And not everything
was true that was

01:09:04.050 --> 01:09:06.160
being spread on social media.

01:09:06.160 --> 01:09:09.680
So it's this whole constant
kind of figuring out

01:09:09.680 --> 01:09:11.990
what is real, what is not.

01:09:11.990 --> 01:09:13.990
Is it really happening?

01:09:13.990 --> 01:09:14.840
Who's there?

01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:16.060
Someone you trust?

01:09:16.060 --> 01:09:19.340
Try to get somebody on
Twitter that you think

01:09:19.340 --> 01:09:22.206
will not be talking bullshit.

01:09:22.206 --> 01:09:27.330
And then you have, also, groups
that form themselves according

01:09:27.330 --> 01:09:29.479
to how the events unfold.

01:09:29.479 --> 01:09:35.460
And so some of them are focusing
on giving you the right news.

01:09:35.460 --> 01:09:38.580
Some of them are
focusing on giving you

01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:41.479
information about what
medical supplies are needed.

01:09:41.479 --> 01:09:43.769
Some of them are organized.

01:09:43.769 --> 01:09:45.060
And this was really incredible.

01:09:45.060 --> 01:09:48.300
Much later in the game,
we had a huge amount

01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:49.990
of sexual harassment in Tahrir.

01:09:49.990 --> 01:09:53.529
So you have this amazing
crowd, especially

01:09:53.529 --> 01:09:56.635
of women, that got together--
and young women-- that

01:09:56.635 --> 01:09:59.630
got together to
organize bodyguards,

01:09:59.630 --> 01:10:02.980
and people who would help
people go through the square

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.560
without being sexually harassed.

01:10:04.560 --> 01:10:07.030
Of course, they got
sexually harassed themselves

01:10:07.030 --> 01:10:07.820
following that.

01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:09.260
So it was pretty crazy.

01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:13.230
But you had this amazing
amount of energy of people

01:10:13.230 --> 01:10:17.580
really putting themselves
together, and coming in groups,

01:10:17.580 --> 01:10:21.520
and creating a different
support system.

01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.230
So this is really
fascinating, in how

01:10:23.230 --> 01:10:24.580
people used social media.

01:10:24.580 --> 01:10:27.344
And that way was
really beautiful.

01:10:27.344 --> 01:10:28.760
PROFESSOR: The
authors that we had

01:10:28.760 --> 01:10:32.260
to read for today, they
seem to be convinced

01:10:32.260 --> 01:10:35.270
that the most successful
movements are always driven

01:10:35.270 --> 01:10:38.140
by face-to-face relation,
on-the-ground organization,

01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:40.085
not only by social media.

01:10:43.590 --> 01:10:45.940
And moreover, they
would go as far

01:10:45.940 --> 01:10:49.340
as saying that, when we put
all our energy on building

01:10:49.340 --> 01:10:53.050
websites, innovative software,
technological infrastructure,

01:10:53.050 --> 01:10:56.415
we're taking away the focus
from building more movement

01:10:56.415 --> 01:10:58.890
and alliance on the
ground, and connecting,

01:10:58.890 --> 01:11:03.670
like making real relationship
with local communities.

01:11:03.670 --> 01:11:08.880
It may be more accurate
for the Occupy Movement.

01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:12.620
And there's also this idea
that the virtual proximity

01:11:12.620 --> 01:11:16.080
that we can experiment
online doesn't compare

01:11:16.080 --> 01:11:20.350
to the community feeling,
the body density,

01:11:20.350 --> 01:11:23.200
of the protest
camps where people

01:11:23.200 --> 01:11:26.500
eat, sleep together, defend
their territories together.

01:11:26.500 --> 01:11:30.900
So there's this
proximity of the bodies.

01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:33.412
I don't know how
you feel about this.

01:11:33.412 --> 01:11:34.870
Do you think it's
important to keep

01:11:34.870 --> 01:11:39.870
this face-to-face interaction
and physically occupy

01:11:39.870 --> 01:11:41.650
a space during a revolution?

01:11:41.650 --> 01:11:45.297
Or a revolution can
only happen online?

01:11:45.297 --> 01:11:46.380
LARA BALADI: I don't know.

01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:48.720
I'm not a specialist in
organizing revolutions.

01:11:48.720 --> 01:11:52.570
But I mean, I don't know.

01:11:52.570 --> 01:11:54.570
I mean, it's--

01:11:54.570 --> 01:11:56.700
PROFESSOR: Maybe a more
easy question for you,

01:11:56.700 --> 01:11:58.960
because it's kind of
abstract, but did,

01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:01.840
at some point in the
revolution, Tahrir

01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:04.860
became a kind of
coordination platform

01:12:04.860 --> 01:12:07.000
more than social media?

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.209
Meaning like you could get
information on the ground?

01:12:10.209 --> 01:12:11.500
LARA BALADI: No, no, of course.

01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.541
It was very different what
happened on the ground

01:12:13.541 --> 01:12:16.880
and what you could--
depending on-- I

01:12:16.880 --> 01:12:19.340
mean, if you are somebody on
Twitter since two or three

01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:21.420
years, I think
you would probably

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:30.300
have a much more understandable
kind of map of actions, events.

01:12:30.300 --> 01:12:32.840
And you would probably
have been aware

01:12:32.840 --> 01:12:35.005
of the Facebook
page of Khaled Saeed

01:12:35.005 --> 01:12:38.010
and so on, much more before
all of this would start.

01:12:38.010 --> 01:12:40.345
So if you're part of that
generation, or a journalist,

01:12:40.345 --> 01:12:44.460
again-- were the
main two categories

01:12:44.460 --> 01:12:46.950
of people that used
Twitter, for example.

01:12:46.950 --> 01:12:50.570
I'll leave Facebook
out for a while.

01:12:50.570 --> 01:12:54.490
You would be really aware
of which kind of people

01:12:54.490 --> 01:12:57.860
have an interesting
perception of the events,

01:12:57.860 --> 01:12:59.650
and how to negotiate that.

01:12:59.650 --> 01:13:01.070
And then on the
ground, you would

01:13:01.070 --> 01:13:05.010
be, therefore, definitely
magnetized or attracted

01:13:05.010 --> 01:13:08.060
by different areas
in the square,

01:13:08.060 --> 01:13:10.940
and where people were
organized, or understand better

01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:14.070
the kind of actual mapping of
the ground of the picture I

01:13:14.070 --> 01:13:19.650
showed you where you can see
the bloggers and all of this.

01:13:19.650 --> 01:13:22.190
I mean, as far as I'm
concerned, it was kind of weird.

01:13:22.190 --> 01:13:29.020
Because I lost my phone very--
not only there was no internet,

01:13:29.020 --> 01:13:30.910
but I also lost my
phone, like two,

01:13:30.910 --> 01:13:32.809
three days after the
whole thing started.

01:13:32.809 --> 01:13:34.350
And of course, every
shop was closed,

01:13:34.350 --> 01:13:36.910
so I couldn't get a new
phone for a few days.

01:13:36.910 --> 01:13:39.840
So I really wanted a phone just
to call my mother in Lebanon

01:13:39.840 --> 01:13:41.940
and just make sure
she wouldn't worry.

01:13:41.940 --> 01:13:43.560
But I was completely
disconnected

01:13:43.560 --> 01:13:46.260
from my normal, daily life.

01:13:46.260 --> 01:13:50.640
And I ended up being
much more connected

01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:54.350
to people on the streets, and
knowing people on the street,

01:13:54.350 --> 01:13:58.220
and figuring out how
the square is organized,

01:13:58.220 --> 01:14:00.850
and participate with that.

01:14:00.850 --> 01:14:04.100
I think your question can
be answered by yes and no,

01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:08.410
because we're talking 18 days
where something very specific,

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:12.010
where people really
conglomerated

01:14:12.010 --> 01:14:14.784
to Tahrir-- and in Alex
and every other city.

01:14:14.784 --> 01:14:16.200
We're always talking
about Tahrir,

01:14:16.200 --> 01:14:19.600
but there is the rest of Egypt.

01:14:19.600 --> 01:14:21.530
But something, again,
in that period,

01:14:21.530 --> 01:14:25.470
you have a very clear enemy and
you have a very careful goal.

01:14:25.470 --> 01:14:28.150
But then afterwards, it's
a very different situation.

01:14:28.150 --> 01:14:31.400
And then so the negotiations
that happened on the street

01:14:31.400 --> 01:14:37.910
or online are a very
different kind of-- they've

01:14:37.910 --> 01:14:40.360
become very different
in terms of the dynamics

01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.430
and how they influenced
what happens.

01:14:42.430 --> 01:14:46.940
So there were periods where
Facebook and Twitter were

01:14:46.940 --> 01:14:50.019
at the front of what you needed
to look at to really know

01:14:50.019 --> 01:14:50.810
what was happening.

01:14:50.810 --> 01:14:55.180
So I would say this was for sure
the case during the 18 days.

01:14:55.180 --> 01:14:59.110
At the later stage,
there was much more focus

01:14:59.110 --> 01:15:02.530
between foreign media, local
media and social media.

01:15:02.530 --> 01:15:04.910
So it was really covered by
everybody and everything.

01:15:04.910 --> 01:15:07.690
And that was like a
total concentration

01:15:07.690 --> 01:15:10.520
of media from all directions.

01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:15.690
And less action on the streets,
because the sit-in finished.

01:15:15.690 --> 01:15:19.750
Some people stayed,
but not the majority.

01:15:19.750 --> 01:15:22.300
And then you have
other waves, where

01:15:22.300 --> 01:15:24.470
there's much more
analysis going on,

01:15:24.470 --> 01:15:26.890
where the politics
on the ground are not

01:15:26.890 --> 01:15:30.560
as violent, or not as
regularity violent,

01:15:30.560 --> 01:15:33.150
or not as regularly intense.

01:15:33.150 --> 01:15:35.730
But what happens online
is extraordinary.

01:15:35.730 --> 01:15:39.100
And you have like 100
people talking, every day

01:15:39.100 --> 01:15:41.270
writing blogs, and so on.

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:44.737
Plus, television becomes
occupied by talking heads.

01:15:44.737 --> 01:15:46.320
And it's talking
heads, talking heads.

01:15:46.320 --> 01:15:48.650
There was two years
of talking heads,

01:15:48.650 --> 01:15:51.230
of people finally talking.

01:15:51.230 --> 01:15:52.610
And so it's analysis.

01:15:52.610 --> 01:15:53.560
So what's going on?

01:15:53.560 --> 01:15:54.610
What do you think is going on?

01:15:54.610 --> 01:15:55.730
What do you think
is going to happen?

01:15:55.730 --> 01:15:56.940
What do you think of these guys?

01:15:56.940 --> 01:15:58.240
What do you think of
the Muslim Brotherhood?

01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.520
What do you think of the army?

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.880
And we could say
anything we wanted.

01:16:00.880 --> 01:16:03.130
We just didn't realize we
wouldn't have that much time

01:16:03.130 --> 01:16:04.300
to continue to do so.

01:16:04.300 --> 01:16:08.240
But it was quite an
extraordinary period.

01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:10.820
And so again, it's
this kind of power

01:16:10.820 --> 01:16:14.220
of what has more power
at a different moment

01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:15.520
than another moment?

01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.690
And so it's also,
again, a kind of balance

01:16:17.690 --> 01:16:23.220
between how social media is
influential, or how media is,

01:16:23.220 --> 01:16:25.745
or how being on the ground is.

01:16:25.745 --> 01:16:27.120
And there was a
very clear moment

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.600
where people said, you
know, it doesn't do anything

01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.351
to go to Tahrir anymore.

01:16:31.351 --> 01:16:32.350
We have to go back home.

01:16:32.350 --> 01:16:35.180
And we have to do the real work.

01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:39.010
And the real work is change very
fundamental aspects and values

01:16:39.010 --> 01:16:40.020
within society.

01:16:40.020 --> 01:16:43.200
It's not going to the
street and rebelling.

01:16:43.200 --> 01:16:46.520
Rebelling is important, but
then you have to follow up.

01:16:46.520 --> 01:16:48.990
And follow up means you
have to educate people.

01:16:48.990 --> 01:16:50.230
You have to work with them.

01:16:50.230 --> 01:16:52.980
You have to get involved
in your communities.

01:16:52.980 --> 01:16:57.270
You have to act directly with
people that are your neighbors.

01:16:57.270 --> 01:16:59.120
And that can take
10 years, 20 years.

01:16:59.120 --> 01:17:01.810
And not everybody wants to spend
that kind of time doing that.

01:17:01.810 --> 01:17:03.930
So that's, again,
another subject.

01:17:03.930 --> 01:17:06.406
But that's the
kind of landscape.

01:17:06.406 --> 01:17:08.530
PROFESSOR: I want to make
sure we have time to talk

01:17:08.530 --> 01:17:10.150
about your current work.

01:17:10.150 --> 01:17:15.386
So we can go more quickly
on the next questions.

01:17:15.386 --> 01:17:19.140
In the book we had to
read, Digital Rebellion,

01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:20.850
there's the one
problematic aspect

01:17:20.850 --> 01:17:23.660
of the contemporary activism
that was underlined.

01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:26.060
It is the difficulty to
connect with local struggle,

01:17:26.060 --> 01:17:28.690
local communities, people
from the working class.

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.200
So we said this before.

01:17:30.200 --> 01:17:32.660
But also, the fact
that these movements

01:17:32.660 --> 01:17:36.480
are using the new technologies
and internet so much that it

01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:40.730
tends to favor the leadership
of white, male, college-educated

01:17:40.730 --> 01:17:44.650
activists at the expense
of homeless people,

01:17:44.650 --> 01:17:48.450
unemployed, women, people
of color, indigenous.

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:49.840
was it also the case in Egypt?

01:17:49.840 --> 01:17:53.530
How diversified was the
crowd on Tahrir Square?

01:17:53.530 --> 01:17:57.010
Were there, like, people from
very different background,

01:17:57.010 --> 01:17:57.860
women and men?

01:17:57.860 --> 01:18:03.310
Or they were more favoring men?

01:18:03.310 --> 01:18:06.110
LARA BALADI: So in the 18
days, it was very different.

01:18:06.110 --> 01:18:09.100
Everybody remembers the 18
days as something unique,

01:18:09.100 --> 01:18:10.910
and then there's the rest.

01:18:10.910 --> 01:18:12.640
But during the 18
days, of course,

01:18:12.640 --> 01:18:18.160
it was mainly occupied
by all these young people

01:18:18.160 --> 01:18:21.850
that were on Facebook and did
this Khaled Saeed page, and so

01:18:21.850 --> 01:18:25.200
on, and who were coming out
of universities, and so on.

01:18:25.200 --> 01:18:28.970
But there was also a
majority of population

01:18:28.970 --> 01:18:38.780
from every kind of-- every city,
every area of Cairo, from Alex.

01:18:38.780 --> 01:18:43.890
People were very diverse,
people who were in the square.

01:18:43.890 --> 01:18:47.740
But there was a kind of attitude
that was very particular

01:18:47.740 --> 01:18:48.850
during those 18 days.

01:18:48.850 --> 01:18:51.455
And again, I think it has to
do with the clarity of who

01:18:51.455 --> 01:18:53.140
you're fighting.

01:18:53.140 --> 01:18:56.175
And so nobody complained
of sexual harassment

01:18:56.175 --> 01:18:59.230
in those 18 days.

01:18:59.230 --> 01:19:00.740
Although I think
I'm sure there was.

01:19:00.740 --> 01:19:03.510
But I mean, it
wasn't like-- there

01:19:03.510 --> 01:19:05.940
was something that
held people together,

01:19:05.940 --> 01:19:10.070
because it was so dramatic.

01:19:10.070 --> 01:19:15.550
And it was so-- we didn't
know what's going to happen.

01:19:15.550 --> 01:19:18.730
And we knew that if this fails,
we'll all end up in jail.

01:19:18.730 --> 01:19:20.020
So it couldn't fail.

01:19:20.020 --> 01:19:20.910
It's too late.

01:19:20.910 --> 01:19:22.355
We've gone already too far.

01:19:22.355 --> 01:19:24.360
And actually, everybody
is in jail now.

01:19:24.360 --> 01:19:26.020
Most of the people
who were really,

01:19:26.020 --> 01:19:29.560
really at the front of--
like obvious activists

01:19:29.560 --> 01:19:33.480
are, for a lot of them,
either in jail, or not even.

01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:36.970
There's thousands of people
that have been arrested.

01:19:36.970 --> 01:19:38.470
And the others have
left the country

01:19:38.470 --> 01:19:40.428
because they've been
threatened to be arrested.

01:19:40.428 --> 01:19:48.452
So you have a real
escape of intellect

01:19:48.452 --> 01:19:51.550
as it happens in
those situations.

01:19:51.550 --> 01:19:56.690
But the general sense
is that, in the 18 days,

01:19:56.690 --> 01:19:59.850
you have very clear objective.

01:19:59.850 --> 01:20:04.350
And everybody's together
towards that objective.

01:20:04.350 --> 01:20:06.480
So nobody hurts anybody.

01:20:06.480 --> 01:20:10.300
And time hasn't come
yet to divide people.

01:20:10.300 --> 01:20:12.470
So it's much later,
after Mubarak is toppled,

01:20:12.470 --> 01:20:14.910
that suddenly
everybody is like, OK,

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.900
so who's going to
be in power now?

01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:18.595
So I want the power.

01:20:18.595 --> 01:20:19.496
No, I want the power.

01:20:19.496 --> 01:20:20.371
No, I want the power.

01:20:20.371 --> 01:20:24.030
So there's this kind of--
now society gets divided.

01:20:24.030 --> 01:20:26.770
And people remove their masks.

01:20:26.770 --> 01:20:29.690
30 years, maybe
actually 60 years,

01:20:29.690 --> 01:20:34.070
where the guy who sells
the tomatoes downstairs,

01:20:34.070 --> 01:20:38.017
or the man who you buy
your bread from-- you

01:20:38.017 --> 01:20:39.100
don't know what he thinks.

01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.350
You don't know who he is.

01:20:40.350 --> 01:20:43.020
You know he's Muslim, or you
know he's maybe a little bit

01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:43.940
conservative.

01:20:43.940 --> 01:20:46.905
But you're not sure-- you
don't care, even, what he is.

01:20:46.905 --> 01:20:48.280
I mean, personally,
I don't care.

01:20:48.280 --> 01:20:53.860
But suddenly, after the 18 days,
I know this guy is a Salafi.

01:20:53.860 --> 01:20:56.520
And then this guy is
a Muslim Brotherhood.

01:20:56.520 --> 01:20:59.530
This guy is against the Sadat.

01:20:59.530 --> 01:21:01.941
I mean, everybody becomes
who they really are.

01:21:01.941 --> 01:21:04.190
And they're not afraid of
showing who they really are.

01:21:04.190 --> 01:21:06.690
So the beards grew.

01:21:06.690 --> 01:21:10.240
Also, the young people like
you started to have beards.

01:21:10.240 --> 01:21:12.620
And I was, like, why is
everybody growing a beard?

01:21:12.620 --> 01:21:14.730
And I started asking
everybody, like, OK, I

01:21:14.730 --> 01:21:17.470
get it that Muslim Brotherhood
will have their beards,

01:21:17.470 --> 01:21:20.190
because they've been arrested
for the last 30 years

01:21:20.190 --> 01:21:23.380
and they've been in jail
for the last 30 years.

01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:25.650
So, but why you,
my friend, why--

01:21:25.650 --> 01:21:27.400
I know you are not the
Brotherhood, so why

01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:29.110
are you growing your beard?

01:21:29.110 --> 01:21:32.150
What's up with this
bloody fashion?

01:21:32.150 --> 01:21:34.570
And they're like, well,
when you're young,

01:21:34.570 --> 01:21:38.140
in your early 20s,
30s, the police

01:21:38.140 --> 01:21:40.270
arrest you systematically
if you're a man

01:21:40.270 --> 01:21:44.270
and you have a little
bit of a beard.

01:21:44.270 --> 01:21:47.100
So actually every
young guy in the street

01:21:47.100 --> 01:21:49.310
let their beards grow,
because finally, they

01:21:49.310 --> 01:21:53.780
were not harassed by the
police for being maybe

01:21:53.780 --> 01:21:55.770
a Brotherhood or maybe not.

01:21:55.770 --> 01:21:59.090
So it's really interesting
to watch this happen.

01:21:59.090 --> 01:22:02.620
And of course, when
the military came back

01:22:02.620 --> 01:22:05.190
after the Brotherhood
took power and so on,

01:22:05.190 --> 01:22:06.840
it was this joke
on Facebook, which

01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:10.940
was the Bic-- the company
Bic that sells razors--

01:22:10.940 --> 01:22:12.190
is going to make a fortune.

01:22:12.190 --> 01:22:14.520
Because everybody's going
to have to shave again,

01:22:14.520 --> 01:22:15.840
which is what happened.

01:22:15.840 --> 01:22:17.350
Nobody has a beard now.

01:22:17.350 --> 01:22:19.100
You don't want to
have a beard now.

01:22:19.100 --> 01:22:22.097
It's not a good place for that.

01:22:22.097 --> 01:22:24.680
PROFESSOR: I want to talk a bit
about the role of social media

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.420
as a emotional conduit.

01:22:26.420 --> 01:22:28.577
I think you had a video
about that somewhere.

01:22:31.230 --> 01:22:34.850
So it's clear that social media
cannot be reduced to a purely

01:22:34.850 --> 01:22:37.720
instrumental tool for
organization and tactical

01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:38.970
coordination.

01:22:38.970 --> 01:22:41.900
It also participates, as
Gerbaudo says in his text,

01:22:41.900 --> 01:22:45.350
to assemble a construction of
a collective identity, a sense

01:22:45.350 --> 01:22:47.570
of togetherness, as
you said earlier,

01:22:47.570 --> 01:22:51.600
among activists, physical
occupiers, and internet users.

01:22:51.600 --> 01:22:55.350
And this is kind of
clear with the page

01:22:55.350 --> 01:22:59.310
of "We are all Khaled
Saeed", but also

01:22:59.310 --> 01:23:03.640
with-- if I can find it--
the Tumblr page blood

01:23:03.640 --> 01:23:10.360
page of Occupy Movement
that was kind of collecting

01:23:10.360 --> 01:23:14.650
different testimonies of
people who consider themselves

01:23:14.650 --> 01:23:18.850
as the 90%, 99%,
kind of as a rallying

01:23:18.850 --> 01:23:22.220
point for the construction of
inclusive popular identity.

01:23:22.220 --> 01:23:24.330
And this moment was really
appealing to everybody.

01:23:27.690 --> 01:23:31.860
So do you think
that social networks

01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:34.620
serve as an emotional conduit
that condense sentiment

01:23:34.620 --> 01:23:39.220
of indignation, anger,
pride, victimhood?

01:23:39.220 --> 01:23:41.810
The other example that
the Facebook page,

01:23:41.810 --> 01:23:43.950
"We are all Khaled
Saeed," [INAUDIBLE]

01:23:43.950 --> 01:23:48.800
maybe show about that?

01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:51.490
This one-- oh, we
show it already.

01:23:51.490 --> 01:23:53.542
LARA BALADI: Yeah,
that was with the army.

01:23:53.542 --> 01:23:55.560
PROFESSOR: But did you
feel that in the end,

01:23:55.560 --> 01:23:58.730
the Facebook page
was really canalizing

01:23:58.730 --> 01:24:00.479
feelings and generating people?

01:24:00.479 --> 01:24:02.770
LARA BALADI: I mean, we are
in a world that is not just

01:24:02.770 --> 01:24:05.120
a generation of 25 years old.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:08.650
But we're in a world
where we all use internet,

01:24:08.650 --> 01:24:10.400
and we all use our computers.

01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.640
We all use social media-- I
mean, the majority of people

01:24:14.640 --> 01:24:15.140
does.

01:24:19.010 --> 01:24:23.020
And we are also at a time
when after-- again, I

01:24:23.020 --> 01:24:26.020
repeat-- after 30
or maybe 60 years,

01:24:26.020 --> 01:24:30.680
even, of a military regime, you
have a little bracket of time

01:24:30.680 --> 01:24:33.220
where everybody's
allowed to talk.

01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:39.470
And so imagine the avalanche
of information that we get.

01:24:39.470 --> 01:24:44.520
So from not being able
to do anything-- talk,

01:24:44.520 --> 01:24:47.190
take photos in the streets
without being harassed

01:24:47.190 --> 01:24:50.990
by some kind of policeman
that is in civil clothes--

01:24:50.990 --> 01:24:53.843
or by a sign that says
"Do not take photos here

01:24:53.843 --> 01:24:55.676
because it's a military
base," because Egypt

01:24:55.676 --> 01:24:57.190
is owned by the military.

01:24:57.190 --> 01:25:01.270
So every street is
military base, really.

01:25:01.270 --> 01:25:05.740
You have from that situation,
you have a complete shift

01:25:05.740 --> 01:25:10.250
overnight to everybody
can say who they are.

01:25:10.250 --> 01:25:12.050
Everybody can say
what they think.

01:25:12.050 --> 01:25:13.870
And so everybody does.

01:25:13.870 --> 01:25:16.120
And in fact, it was
pretty amazing and magical

01:25:16.120 --> 01:25:17.920
and very creative.

01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.750
It was a very, very
creative period

01:25:19.750 --> 01:25:24.270
where people were allowed to
be the best of themselves.

01:25:24.270 --> 01:25:25.450
And they were.

01:25:25.450 --> 01:25:29.700
And so the random citizen
became the biggest artist.

01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:31.900
Suddenly, overnight you
had this amazing video,

01:25:31.900 --> 01:25:35.360
very funny or maybe very
powerful or very emotional

01:25:35.360 --> 01:25:39.950
or very poignant that would be
posted on the net or on Twitter

01:25:39.950 --> 01:25:43.970
or whatever, and would
communicate something.

01:25:43.970 --> 01:25:49.230
And people, again, created not
just with a hashtag or not just

01:25:49.230 --> 01:25:52.370
with a Facebook page, but
they created communities.

01:25:52.370 --> 01:25:55.250
And so you have
thousands of websites

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:59.590
that were born from the
merging of people to collect.

01:25:59.590 --> 01:26:03.120
So for example, you
have-- this can kind of

01:26:03.120 --> 01:26:04.510
go into the work I'm doing now.

01:26:04.510 --> 01:26:08.490
But you had suddenly
a group that organized

01:26:08.490 --> 01:26:12.180
to collect all the papers,
transcripts, messages

01:26:12.180 --> 01:26:14.330
that were circulating
every day in Tahrir,

01:26:14.330 --> 01:26:15.950
according to what was happening.

01:26:15.950 --> 01:26:19.050
And this is, in itself,
an extraordinary amount

01:26:19.050 --> 01:26:20.075
of documents.

01:26:20.075 --> 01:26:21.700
And so they would
take these documents,

01:26:21.700 --> 01:26:24.070
and scan them, and
put them on the net.

01:26:24.070 --> 01:26:27.830
And so this is a website
called TahrirDocuments

01:26:27.830 --> 01:26:29.730
where you can go
and you can see,

01:26:29.730 --> 01:26:32.230
according to the date,
what was being circulated,

01:26:32.230 --> 01:26:35.310
what was available in the
square, what people were giving

01:26:35.310 --> 01:26:36.524
each other, handing out.

01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.940
So you have a great
community-- a number

01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:45.990
of communities that have
archived different aspects

01:26:45.990 --> 01:26:47.420
of the revolution.

01:26:47.420 --> 01:26:50.290
You have people
who have created,

01:26:50.290 --> 01:26:52.980
of course a lot of a music
came out of the revolution.

01:26:52.980 --> 01:26:55.910
This was one of
the biggest outcome

01:26:55.910 --> 01:26:57.230
of the first couple of months.

01:26:59.890 --> 01:27:04.065
You really had a huge
amount of creativity.

01:27:04.065 --> 01:27:07.220
And in a way, this is what I
was telling you-- it's kind

01:27:07.220 --> 01:27:15.320
of the difference between
activists, artists, activism,

01:27:15.320 --> 01:27:20.060
also people doing art, but
in an activist kind of way,

01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:23.540
and not necessarily in a kind
of contemporary art kind of way.

01:27:23.540 --> 01:27:27.900
So it's more something that
is using creativity as a tool,

01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:31.070
but as a tool to
fight back, to answer

01:27:31.070 --> 01:27:32.440
something that is happening.

01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:36.250
So there was a whole
lot of expression

01:27:36.250 --> 01:27:39.090
and ways of expressing
oneself that

01:27:39.090 --> 01:27:43.045
was born from the first few
months of the revolution.

01:27:43.045 --> 01:27:44.920
I'm not sure I'm answering
you, but I think--

01:27:44.920 --> 01:27:46.336
PROFESSOR: Yeah,
just I don't want

01:27:46.336 --> 01:27:48.050
to go too far on
what we're going

01:27:48.050 --> 01:27:50.560
to talk later about your work.

01:27:50.560 --> 01:27:53.290
So let me just ask
you this question

01:27:53.290 --> 01:27:59.430
about the logic of Orientalism
of the Cyber Left movement.

01:27:59.430 --> 01:28:02.800
Because all these new
activist movements,

01:28:02.800 --> 01:28:05.590
like Occupy,
Anonymous, Arab Spring

01:28:05.590 --> 01:28:10.100
and even Indymedia before,
they claim to be a movement.

01:28:10.100 --> 01:28:13.760
They present himself as a
direct [INAUDIBLE] democracy

01:28:13.760 --> 01:28:16.820
with a preference for horizontal
structure instead of vertical.

01:28:16.820 --> 01:28:19.560
So basically, they say they
don't have any leaders.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.620
They don't do elections.

01:28:21.620 --> 01:28:24.150
Everybody's a leader, kind of.

01:28:24.150 --> 01:28:27.150
And then the authors
of the text that we

01:28:27.150 --> 01:28:29.720
had to read for today-- they
claim that these movements were

01:28:29.720 --> 01:28:34.170
not as leaderless-- as
flat-- as they claim.

01:28:34.170 --> 01:28:39.180
And I'm curious to know if it's
the same feeling that you have.

01:28:39.180 --> 01:28:41.500
Gerbaudo used the
concept of choreographer

01:28:41.500 --> 01:28:44.730
to describe the kind of
soft form of leadership

01:28:44.730 --> 01:28:48.600
that took place during
these movements-- people who

01:28:48.600 --> 01:28:53.580
kind of are Facebook admins,
Tweets or bloggers, who

01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:58.450
set this stage but without being
in the forefront, people who

01:28:58.450 --> 01:29:05.290
orchestrate the, for example,
the Occupy Wall Street

01:29:05.290 --> 01:29:09.310
advertising campaign that was
really carefully organized.

01:29:09.310 --> 01:29:13.260
So you see that there
are some brains emerging

01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.305
in these movements.

01:29:17.060 --> 01:29:20.580
Do you have any
example of soft leaders

01:29:20.580 --> 01:29:23.750
that were organizing the stage?

01:29:23.750 --> 01:29:27.650
I know that there were some
bloggers that were maybe having

01:29:27.650 --> 01:29:30.160
a bigger influence.

01:29:30.160 --> 01:29:34.430
LARA BALADI: I mean, there's a
whole culture of bloggers that

01:29:34.430 --> 01:29:36.740
was born in the
Middle East, I think

01:29:36.740 --> 01:29:39.730
very much after
2006 war in Lebanon

01:29:39.730 --> 01:29:44.120
and the influence of how people
used internet at the time.

01:29:44.120 --> 01:29:47.270
And so they created a kind of
community across the region,

01:29:47.270 --> 01:29:48.720
not just in Egypt.

01:29:48.720 --> 01:29:54.730
And so of course, there's some
very influential people online.

01:29:54.730 --> 01:29:58.050
Hamalawi is one of
them, because he

01:29:58.050 --> 01:30:04.630
is the one who-- he's
a [INAUDIBLE] activist

01:30:04.630 --> 01:30:06.450
who is also a photographer.

01:30:06.450 --> 01:30:13.210
And he documented 6 of April,
2008 Mahala demonstrations

01:30:13.210 --> 01:30:15.620
that I was describing
earlier, which

01:30:15.620 --> 01:30:18.430
then led to the
group that became

01:30:18.430 --> 01:30:22.790
opposing the power--
the 6 of April movement.

01:30:22.790 --> 01:30:26.630
So Hamalawi, for example,
was documenting already

01:30:26.630 --> 01:30:28.420
in 2008 those movements.

01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:31.250
Because he works a lot
with workers in Egypt.

01:30:31.250 --> 01:30:37.170
And he blogged already three
years before the revolution

01:30:37.170 --> 01:30:42.180
that so revolution
will be Flickr-ized.

01:30:42.180 --> 01:30:47.420
And his statement was
that if we take photos,

01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:53.970
and if we manage to document
what is actually happening,

01:30:53.970 --> 01:30:57.830
and posting it, and making
people see what is happening,

01:30:57.830 --> 01:31:02.170
then there will be a movement
that will come out of it.

01:31:02.170 --> 01:31:05.470
And again, this was countering
the media propaganda, which was

01:31:05.470 --> 01:31:07.770
not showing any of this stuff.

01:31:07.770 --> 01:31:10.450
We all knew it, but not
really, but kind of.

01:31:10.450 --> 01:31:14.980
So of course, there was
very important people who

01:31:14.980 --> 01:31:16.250
were doing the work already.

01:31:16.250 --> 01:31:19.860
It's not like it
happened overnight.

01:31:19.860 --> 01:31:22.320
But they were not--
they were activists.

01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.790
They were not trying
to take power.

01:31:24.790 --> 01:31:27.712
And a lot of them, they
didn't know how to take power.

01:31:27.712 --> 01:31:28.991
And it's not what they do.

01:31:28.991 --> 01:31:30.990
PROFESSOR: Some of them
became micro-celebrities

01:31:30.990 --> 01:31:32.415
against their own will, right?

01:31:32.415 --> 01:31:36.560
LARA BALADI: Yeah, I mean,
they were happy to be.

01:31:36.560 --> 01:31:38.363
PROFESSOR: They
tried to be modest.

01:31:38.363 --> 01:31:40.654
LARA BALADI: No one refuses
to be a celebrity, I think.

01:31:40.654 --> 01:31:42.910
It's kind of a human thing.

01:31:42.910 --> 01:31:47.450
But these people are not--
because they're activists,

01:31:47.450 --> 01:31:48.980
they are not politicians.

01:31:48.980 --> 01:31:50.700
It's not because
you in the street

01:31:50.700 --> 01:31:52.520
that you're a revolutionary.

01:31:52.520 --> 01:31:55.260
It's not because
you are an activist

01:31:55.260 --> 01:31:57.300
that you understand politics.

01:31:57.300 --> 01:32:00.680
It's not because you are an
artist that you necessarily

01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:01.380
do good art.

01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:04.945
So these things are not simple.

01:32:04.945 --> 01:32:07.020
And it's great to
have a movement.

01:32:07.020 --> 01:32:13.640
But where it fails is that there
is no handing over that moment

01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:17.706
that we have a little bit of
power, but it's very fragile.

01:32:17.706 --> 01:32:25.250
And we let go of that very
fragile shift that can happen.

01:32:25.250 --> 01:32:29.010
And instead of giving
the lead to someone

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:31.520
who actually understands
politics, and is

01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.360
able to take over the role of a
part in a political party that

01:32:36.360 --> 01:32:39.700
could hold together a country
like Egypt that has 90

01:32:39.700 --> 01:32:41.540
million people, I mean, insane.

01:32:44.150 --> 01:32:49.185
Instead of that, you watch
people disagreeing and ego

01:32:49.185 --> 01:32:51.020
fighting.

01:32:51.020 --> 01:32:56.500
And something very
important is that the nature

01:32:56.500 --> 01:33:01.120
of a revolution, and the nature
of dictatorship-- so Egypt

01:33:01.120 --> 01:33:07.600
or anywhere in the world--
a dictatorship by nature

01:33:07.600 --> 01:33:12.660
is to dictate to eliminate
anybody opposing them.

01:33:12.660 --> 01:33:15.910
So there is no
actual opposing power

01:33:15.910 --> 01:33:17.970
in place during a dictatorship.

01:33:17.970 --> 01:33:20.610
And that was true
during Mubarak regime.

01:33:20.610 --> 01:33:24.300
So there was a political
party called the Kefaya.

01:33:24.300 --> 01:33:26.440
Kefaya means enough.

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:30.550
And they were really
fighting almost alone

01:33:30.550 --> 01:33:33.400
and always being put in jail and
out, and put in jail and out.

01:33:33.400 --> 01:33:35.944
And they were pretty upset,
because no one really

01:33:35.944 --> 01:33:37.860
talked about them when
the revolution started,

01:33:37.860 --> 01:33:39.651
but they were the only
ones really fighting

01:33:39.651 --> 01:33:42.990
the regime for the seven years
that preceded the revolution.

01:33:42.990 --> 01:33:45.130
And then you had the
6 of April movement,

01:33:45.130 --> 01:33:47.620
which was relatively
new-- three years--

01:33:47.620 --> 01:33:50.310
but still not so public.

01:33:50.310 --> 01:33:55.020
And they were preparing a
revolution for September 2011,

01:33:55.020 --> 01:33:59.740
because they had gone to, I
think, the Republic of Czech

01:33:59.740 --> 01:34:03.380
and been trained in
different parts of the world

01:34:03.380 --> 01:34:07.970
where there had been peaceful
revolutions, that had actually

01:34:07.970 --> 01:34:09.830
succeeded.

01:34:09.830 --> 01:34:14.950
But that was a plan just
before the next election

01:34:14.950 --> 01:34:18.020
where Mubarak was going
to put his son in power.

01:34:18.020 --> 01:34:22.110
So when this happened,
there was no plan.

01:34:22.110 --> 01:34:25.070
We didn't go to the streets
saying, we want the revolution.

01:34:25.070 --> 01:34:28.060
There was no plan to
hand the power over,

01:34:28.060 --> 01:34:31.610
to have somebody ready to
take power if that would work.

01:34:31.610 --> 01:34:32.149
So--

01:34:32.149 --> 01:34:33.440
PROFESSOR: Would you say that--

01:34:33.440 --> 01:34:35.231
LARA BALADI: That's
where the gap sort of--

01:34:35.231 --> 01:34:38.300
PROFESSOR: Yeah, because
the authors that we read,

01:34:38.300 --> 01:34:42.390
they kind of argue that
these leaderless movements,

01:34:42.390 --> 01:34:45.410
they don't allow to make
proactive decisions,

01:34:45.410 --> 01:34:48.940
build long-term
powerful organization.

01:34:48.940 --> 01:34:52.730
And not investing in
leadership will eventually

01:34:52.730 --> 01:34:56.360
lead to the dismantle
of these movements.

01:34:56.360 --> 01:34:57.810
LARA BALADI: Yes, that happened.

01:34:57.810 --> 01:35:00.450
PROFESSOR: You think the
revolution would have benefited

01:35:00.450 --> 01:35:03.040
from having stronger leaders
to take responsibility

01:35:03.040 --> 01:35:05.979
for some failure or some--

01:35:05.979 --> 01:35:07.520
LARA BALADI: Yes,
of course it would.

01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:10.540
But the problem was
that there was nobody.

01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:14.890
And everybody who tried was
rejected by everybody else

01:35:14.890 --> 01:35:15.960
for many reasons.

01:35:15.960 --> 01:35:18.110
So even Baradei, who
came back to Egypt

01:35:18.110 --> 01:35:22.870
three years before
Mubarak left, was not

01:35:22.870 --> 01:35:24.820
liked by the
Egyptian population,

01:35:24.820 --> 01:35:26.630
because he's lived
20 years abroad.

01:35:26.630 --> 01:35:29.110
And also for a very
good reason, which is

01:35:29.110 --> 01:35:33.880
he was one of the actors
that had influenced the Gulf

01:35:33.880 --> 01:35:39.380
War, the Iraq War in 2003 by
being the one who was appointed

01:35:39.380 --> 01:35:43.040
to give the answer on
whether or not there

01:35:43.040 --> 01:35:45.600
was nuclear weapons in Iraq.

01:35:45.600 --> 01:35:47.800
And he said yes.

01:35:47.800 --> 01:35:49.330
We never found any.

01:35:49.330 --> 01:35:51.460
But you know, what the
consequences of that

01:35:51.460 --> 01:35:52.580
is terrible.

01:35:52.580 --> 01:35:54.460
And so of course people
don't forget that.

01:35:54.460 --> 01:35:56.028
So when he came and
said, hello, I'm

01:35:56.028 --> 01:35:57.650
going to be the next
president, of course everybody

01:35:57.650 --> 01:35:58.422
said excuse me?

01:35:58.422 --> 01:36:01.039
Who are you?

01:36:01.039 --> 01:36:02.455
So that was the
case for everybody

01:36:02.455 --> 01:36:04.760
who presented
themselves as a leader.

01:36:04.760 --> 01:36:08.020
So even the Brotherhood,
even everybody

01:36:08.020 --> 01:36:13.690
who-- but who can be ready when
there's a dictatorship that

01:36:13.690 --> 01:36:16.470
does not-- that puts
people in jail if they say,

01:36:16.470 --> 01:36:19.805
I'm going to present myself
at the next election.

01:36:19.805 --> 01:36:21.430
Next thing you know
is they're arrested

01:36:21.430 --> 01:36:23.260
or they have to
leave the country.

01:36:23.260 --> 01:36:27.620
So that's the nature
of dictatorship.

01:36:27.620 --> 01:36:29.410
So you're surrounded by a wall.

01:36:29.410 --> 01:36:30.931
You need to break the wall.

01:36:30.931 --> 01:36:32.680
And you don't know
what's behind the wall.

01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.480
And you're not ready
to go behind the wall.

01:36:34.480 --> 01:36:35.450
But you have no other choice.

01:36:35.450 --> 01:36:36.470
That's the first step.

01:36:36.470 --> 01:36:38.590
You need to break that wall.

01:36:38.590 --> 01:36:40.220
So we broke the wall.

01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:44.560
We're back into
another movement.

01:36:44.560 --> 01:36:48.030
But now we know what's going on.

01:36:48.030 --> 01:36:49.440
And now we know what's going on.

01:36:49.440 --> 01:36:52.690
And things will not
be the way they were.

01:36:52.690 --> 01:36:53.850
It might take more time.

01:36:53.850 --> 01:36:56.580
And it's a very different
battle that will prepare itself.

01:36:56.580 --> 01:37:01.660
But it's a necessity to
go through these steps.

01:37:01.660 --> 01:37:04.790
PROFESSOR: So we don't have
much time left-- ideally,

01:37:04.790 --> 01:37:07.052
10 minutes.

01:37:07.052 --> 01:37:08.010
LARA BALADI: That's OK.

01:37:08.010 --> 01:37:08.910
We talked.

01:37:08.910 --> 01:37:11.222
Everybody had enough, I think.

01:37:11.222 --> 01:37:13.680
PROFESSOR: No, but we want to
talk about your current work,

01:37:13.680 --> 01:37:14.930
because it's very interesting.

01:37:14.930 --> 01:37:17.560
And the obsession of
scholars for the role

01:37:17.560 --> 01:37:19.940
played by Twitter and Facebook
during the revolution kind

01:37:19.940 --> 01:37:22.390
of eclipsed a very interesting
conversation that we

01:37:22.390 --> 01:37:25.400
can have about the role
of traditional media

01:37:25.400 --> 01:37:27.080
in the revolution.

01:37:27.080 --> 01:37:30.834
And since you're the co-founder
of a radio and a cinema,

01:37:30.834 --> 01:37:32.750
during the revolution,
I think you're the best

01:37:32.750 --> 01:37:34.440
person to talk about this.

01:37:34.440 --> 01:37:35.810
So can you talk a little--

01:37:35.810 --> 01:37:37.310
LARA BALADI: Just
traditional media?

01:37:37.310 --> 01:37:41.000
PROFESSOR: Yes, cinema and
radio are traditional media

01:37:41.000 --> 01:37:42.820
compared to digital media.

01:37:42.820 --> 01:37:48.260
So can you talk briefly
about these two initiatives

01:37:48.260 --> 01:37:50.520
before we talk about
your project [INAUDIBLE]?

01:37:50.520 --> 01:37:51.270
LARA BALADI: Sure.

01:37:53.770 --> 01:37:55.205
So again, I'm an artist.

01:37:55.205 --> 01:37:59.300
And when all this started,
I watch this amazing stuff

01:37:59.300 --> 01:38:04.710
come out of nowhere by
people producing music, films

01:38:04.710 --> 01:38:07.970
and so on.

01:38:07.970 --> 01:38:13.690
And I watched one video
that really fascinated me,

01:38:13.690 --> 01:38:17.320
which triggered this
kind of interest

01:38:17.320 --> 01:38:20.640
for what was
happening every day.

01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:26.450
What I was experiencing
was resonating with events

01:38:26.450 --> 01:38:28.290
that I remembered
from my childhood--

01:38:28.290 --> 01:38:30.930
which I didn't live, but
I remember watching on TV

01:38:30.930 --> 01:38:32.810
and being very impressed by.

01:38:32.810 --> 01:38:38.770
So that first video of
a truck and somebody

01:38:38.770 --> 01:38:43.200
standing in front of the
police truck, the water cannon,

01:38:43.200 --> 01:38:44.510
but not going anywhere.

01:38:44.510 --> 01:38:46.040
He would just stay there.

01:38:46.040 --> 01:38:50.000
And so the police goes
backwards, which is incredible.

01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:52.570
And it's one of the
first videos of courage

01:38:52.570 --> 01:38:56.680
that appears and
viral on YouTube.

01:38:56.680 --> 01:38:59.720
And it was posted
on YouTube, and it

01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:06.220
was called [ARABIC]
Courage Video or something.

01:39:06.220 --> 01:39:10.030
And so this connection
with the history,

01:39:10.030 --> 01:39:13.580
with another event
from '89 in China

01:39:13.580 --> 01:39:15.730
of-- if you remember
this video, if you know

01:39:15.730 --> 01:39:20.750
this video of this man standing
in front of an Army tank

01:39:20.750 --> 01:39:24.380
and not moving, and the
whole world watching

01:39:24.380 --> 01:39:28.130
20 tanks kind of going
towards this man--

01:39:28.130 --> 01:39:31.860
triggered the need for
me to see and understand

01:39:31.860 --> 01:39:34.780
what's happening in relationship
to history in the world,

01:39:34.780 --> 01:39:39.230
not just to Egypt
and Egyptian history.

01:39:39.230 --> 01:39:44.030
And so I started collecting
things, and archiving videos

01:39:44.030 --> 01:39:48.550
and just learning, and
collecting, and organizing,

01:39:48.550 --> 01:39:49.760
and so on.

01:39:49.760 --> 01:39:53.950
And one of the first
things I did was-- I

01:39:53.950 --> 01:39:55.460
didn't want to do any art work.

01:39:55.460 --> 01:39:58.660
That was not the time for
me to do any art work.

01:39:58.660 --> 01:40:02.130
But in the square, I
met a lot of people.

01:40:02.130 --> 01:40:04.700
And with a friend of
mine during the 18 days,

01:40:04.700 --> 01:40:06.800
we wanted to do a
free radio so that we

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:12.740
could connect ourselves.

01:40:12.740 --> 01:40:15.070
And the 18 days ended.

01:40:15.070 --> 01:40:17.890
Mubarak was toppled
and so on, but we still

01:40:17.890 --> 01:40:18.890
wanted to do the radio.

01:40:18.890 --> 01:40:21.640
So suddenly, it was not
just my friend and I.

01:40:21.640 --> 01:40:24.570
It was actually this guy next
to me wants to do the radio.

01:40:24.570 --> 01:40:27.182
And then he knows this guy who
also wants to work with him.

01:40:27.182 --> 01:40:28.640
And then this person
is doing this.

01:40:28.640 --> 01:40:30.561
And it was very organic.

01:40:30.561 --> 01:40:32.810
And before I knew it, we
were a whole group of people.

01:40:32.810 --> 01:40:34.950
And we created this radio.

01:40:34.950 --> 01:40:40.390
So it was very spontaneous.

01:40:40.390 --> 01:40:44.145
And it was a lot of--
there's one very funny show

01:40:44.145 --> 01:40:49.000
of two characters
making fun of politics.

01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:51.340
And then there was a lot of
music from the revolution.

01:40:51.340 --> 01:40:56.950
So we were kind of a receptacle
for all this music production

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:59.650
during that period.

01:40:59.650 --> 01:41:06.090
Following that--
that's another image.

01:41:06.090 --> 01:41:09.830
Following that, a
few months later,

01:41:09.830 --> 01:41:13.620
I realized that
most people probably

01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.570
hadn't seen all these
animation videos

01:41:16.570 --> 01:41:19.210
like the one I showed you,
that most people weren't

01:41:19.210 --> 01:41:22.300
on internet, that actually, not
everybody had seen what really

01:41:22.300 --> 01:41:24.030
happened in the 18 days.

01:41:24.030 --> 01:41:27.150
And we were, again,
doing a sit-in in Tahrir.

01:41:27.150 --> 01:41:30.260
So I decided I have
to use the archive

01:41:30.260 --> 01:41:31.260
that I started building.

01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:34.229
And I have to show
this to people.

01:41:34.229 --> 01:41:35.770
And there's a sit-in
that's starting.

01:41:35.770 --> 01:41:37.600
And I know it's going
to take a long time.

01:41:37.600 --> 01:41:39.837
And I'm not going to
sit there in the square

01:41:39.837 --> 01:41:40.670
and not do anything.

01:41:40.670 --> 01:41:43.350
And actually, there's
no images in the square.

01:41:43.350 --> 01:41:45.140
So we need to
focus on something.

01:41:45.140 --> 01:41:46.880
People need to see something.

01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:48.660
So I decided to
make a cinema, but I

01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.940
wasn't sure what and
how-- all of this.

01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:53.690
And then I'm on Twitter, and
I see somebody saying, oh, we

01:41:53.690 --> 01:41:54.790
should project films.

01:41:54.790 --> 01:41:57.060
I was, like, oh, he
wants to do that, too.

01:41:57.060 --> 01:41:58.419
So I connected with him.

01:41:58.419 --> 01:42:00.710
And then somebody else said,
oh, you want to do cinema.

01:42:00.710 --> 01:42:01.777
I know your work.

01:42:01.777 --> 01:42:02.610
I've seen your work.

01:42:02.610 --> 01:42:03.359
I don't know what.

01:42:03.359 --> 01:42:04.693
Are you going to show your work?

01:42:04.693 --> 01:42:06.692
I said, of course I'm not
going to show my work.

01:42:06.692 --> 01:42:08.520
This is like the
middle of a revolution.

01:42:08.520 --> 01:42:10.280
Who cares about seeing my work?

01:42:10.280 --> 01:42:12.900
But let's get together
and talk about it.

01:42:12.900 --> 01:42:15.920
And so we created the
cinema and the sit-in.

01:42:15.920 --> 01:42:19.250
And every night, we
projected material

01:42:19.250 --> 01:42:22.820
that was circulating
on the internet,

01:42:22.820 --> 01:42:26.470
but that most probably,
most people didn't see.

01:42:26.470 --> 01:42:28.870
And it created a
space for a platform

01:42:28.870 --> 01:42:33.930
for debating the revolution,
a platform for convening

01:42:33.930 --> 01:42:35.330
and sharing the archive.

01:42:35.330 --> 01:42:37.260
So people would come
with their phone and say,

01:42:37.260 --> 01:42:39.000
can you give me a
copy of what you show?

01:42:39.000 --> 01:42:43.080
Because I can show
this in my area.

01:42:43.080 --> 01:42:46.440
I can show this to
the coffee next door,

01:42:46.440 --> 01:42:48.580
project it in the
street next to my house.

01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:49.780
I can show it to my family.

01:42:49.780 --> 01:42:51.410
I can bring to my village.

01:42:51.410 --> 01:42:53.900
And I can give
you what I filmed.

01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.740
And so it was a way of
exchanging material and kind

01:42:57.740 --> 01:43:01.300
of disseminating, also,
on the ground, footage

01:43:01.300 --> 01:43:04.580
from the revolution that
was countering the media

01:43:04.580 --> 01:43:07.550
propaganda that was happening.

01:43:07.550 --> 01:43:13.760
So these are some images of the
crowds in the square watching

01:43:13.760 --> 01:43:15.439
the footage.

01:43:15.439 --> 01:43:16.980
PROFESSOR: For the
last five minutes,

01:43:16.980 --> 01:43:21.280
let's talk about your
project on the archiving

01:43:21.280 --> 01:43:24.310
the revolution, because
it's also a concern that we

01:43:24.310 --> 01:43:25.832
should have with digital media.

01:43:25.832 --> 01:43:27.248
LARA BALADI: We
even have popcorn.

01:43:32.210 --> 01:43:34.580
Yeah, so these are
the two projects

01:43:34.580 --> 01:43:43.540
that I've done as the first
sort of actions or outcome

01:43:43.540 --> 01:43:47.270
of collecting material,
and feeling like,

01:43:47.270 --> 01:43:51.200
to make sense of all of this,
because of the collage that you

01:43:51.200 --> 01:43:53.970
saw originally, you can
imagine how my head works.

01:43:53.970 --> 01:43:55.400
And I have to have
lots of stuff,

01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:56.700
and make connections
and all this.

01:43:56.700 --> 01:43:58.074
So it doesn't
happen immediately.

01:43:58.074 --> 01:44:01.660
It takes a little bit of
time to find these links.

01:44:01.660 --> 01:44:03.010
And same thing here.

01:44:03.010 --> 01:44:06.660
I just felt there's no
conclusion to be made now.

01:44:06.660 --> 01:44:08.770
But all these
questions are popping

01:44:08.770 --> 01:44:09.900
every minute in my head.

01:44:09.900 --> 01:44:12.540
So my collection of
archive was really

01:44:12.540 --> 01:44:16.726
about keeping this for when
I'll be able to think about it,

01:44:16.726 --> 01:44:19.660
and when there will be a
moment where things start

01:44:19.660 --> 01:44:21.850
to kind of come down and
I can make sense of it

01:44:21.850 --> 01:44:26.000
and find a link that holds it
all together-- if there is one.

01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:28.200
I don't know.

01:44:28.200 --> 01:44:33.720
And so now my project
here is about looking

01:44:33.720 --> 01:44:37.610
at that period of
two, three years,

01:44:37.610 --> 01:44:41.330
and trying to build a timeline
of the revolution that

01:44:41.330 --> 01:44:43.620
is interactive.

01:44:43.620 --> 01:44:47.470
So this is an example of a
very fantastic, beautiful,

01:44:47.470 --> 01:44:50.440
visual timeline of the
history of the world.

01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:52.760
Which this part is
about ancient Egypt,

01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:55.090
as you see the Sphinx
and the Pyramids.

01:44:55.090 --> 01:44:57.090
And I find it
really fascinating,

01:44:57.090 --> 01:44:59.230
because it has color coding.

01:44:59.230 --> 01:45:00.165
It has images.

01:45:00.165 --> 01:45:01.820
It has text.

01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:03.940
It has a sense of continuity.

01:45:03.940 --> 01:45:05.320
It has layers.

01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:07.180
So things happen in
one country, but you

01:45:07.180 --> 01:45:10.080
can start seeing also what
was happening in parallel

01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:13.640
to Egypt-- so the tsunami
in Japan, bin Laden arrested

01:45:13.640 --> 01:45:18.710
and killed, Occupy Wall Street,
and all these resonating events

01:45:18.710 --> 01:45:22.900
between Tahrir and other
countries in the world.

01:45:22.900 --> 01:45:25.590
And at the same time, being
quite a personal view of it,

01:45:25.590 --> 01:45:27.410
because it's a
collection of elements

01:45:27.410 --> 01:45:30.670
that I'm interested in because
of the nature of the work

01:45:30.670 --> 01:45:33.950
I do and the type of material
I normally work with.

01:45:33.950 --> 01:45:39.310
And so I actually focused
my archive on, again,

01:45:39.310 --> 01:45:41.200
that production-- that
creative production

01:45:41.200 --> 01:45:44.310
from the random
citizen and what I call

01:45:44.310 --> 01:45:48.480
the popular language of Tahrir.

01:45:48.480 --> 01:45:54.520
So these are early sketches of
my timeline made from a photo

01:45:54.520 --> 01:45:57.060
that I took, videos
that I collected,

01:45:57.060 --> 01:46:00.280
et cetera, et cetera.

01:46:00.280 --> 01:46:03.200
This is a detail.

01:46:03.200 --> 01:46:07.550
And then this is,
one of the graffitis

01:46:07.550 --> 01:46:10.480
from Mohamed Mahmoud
Street that's is

01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:16.570
one of the areas that come out
of Tahrir and where the street

01:46:16.570 --> 01:46:19.820
graffiti artists of
the revolution have,

01:46:19.820 --> 01:46:22.680
over and over and over
again, and overlaid

01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:25.960
all these fantastic paintings
as things happened--

01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:28.850
portraits of martyrs and so on.

01:46:28.850 --> 01:46:31.710
And that huge, walled,
continuous street

01:46:31.710 --> 01:46:35.990
is so extraordinary,
and constitutes a really

01:46:35.990 --> 01:46:38.690
ongoing tableau vivant.

01:46:38.690 --> 01:46:42.440
And that mix between that
kind of art in the street

01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:44.770
and that influence of
that beautiful painting

01:46:44.770 --> 01:46:48.345
and the social media
production that we experience

01:46:48.345 --> 01:46:51.070
is, for me, sort of
missing something

01:46:51.070 --> 01:46:52.950
that it needs to come together.

01:46:52.950 --> 01:46:55.270
And so what I'm trying to
do is a kind of painting

01:46:55.270 --> 01:47:00.250
of the 21st century, but that
is interactive so that you would

01:47:00.250 --> 01:47:03.180
be immersed in as an
audience, but also

01:47:03.180 --> 01:47:06.450
be able to kind of talk
to and look at in a way

01:47:06.450 --> 01:47:08.320
that you would say,
OK, I'm interested.

01:47:08.320 --> 01:47:12.310
And your question
is, what is the role

01:47:12.310 --> 01:47:14.930
of the Army or the social
media in the revolution?

01:47:14.930 --> 01:47:17.410
And so you would
only see-- suddenly,

01:47:17.410 --> 01:47:20.420
the rest of the timeline
would sort of disappear.

01:47:20.420 --> 01:47:24.010
And what comes forward
would be all the aspects

01:47:24.010 --> 01:47:26.390
and all the moments in which
social media is actually

01:47:26.390 --> 01:47:31.380
mentioned in an article,
or is in a hashtag of one

01:47:31.380 --> 01:47:35.425
or another type of media
that is being displayed.

01:47:39.230 --> 01:47:42.535
PROFESSOR: Well I
cannot wait to see it.

01:47:42.535 --> 01:47:45.390
Seriously.

01:47:45.390 --> 01:47:49.510
Is there questions specifically
on the presentation?

01:47:49.510 --> 01:47:52.930
Because we're going to have a
discussion later on things that

01:47:52.930 --> 01:47:54.110
you posted on the forum.

01:47:54.110 --> 01:48:00.380
But is there any questions
related to what we spoke about?

01:48:00.380 --> 01:48:02.760
AUDIENCE: Yeah, there
is kind of a place which

01:48:02.760 --> 01:48:08.396
you said you built next to
real military base or something

01:48:08.396 --> 01:48:09.630
like that?

01:48:09.630 --> 01:48:11.660
How did they let you do that?

01:48:11.660 --> 01:48:13.690
LARA BALADI: So
the military base

01:48:13.690 --> 01:48:19.540
is a huge area that was
a little bit elitist.

01:48:19.540 --> 01:48:23.615
So poor people were
not very welcomed.

01:48:23.615 --> 01:48:29.680
And usually, they tended
to be kind of kicked out.

01:48:29.680 --> 01:48:35.850
In the middle of it is the Opera
House, the Library of Music

01:48:35.850 --> 01:48:39.190
and the Pavilion of Arts.

01:48:39.190 --> 01:48:42.920
And all of this is
managed by the government,

01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:44.670
the Ministry of Culture.

01:48:44.670 --> 01:48:50.460
But the area and that whole
space belongs to the military.

01:48:50.460 --> 01:48:54.270
And there's a military base
just next to the opera.

01:48:54.270 --> 01:48:56.800
So it's surrounded by security.

01:48:56.800 --> 01:48:59.770
It's very well guarded
and blah, blah, blah.

01:48:59.770 --> 01:49:02.990
And one of the events
is, funny enough,

01:49:02.990 --> 01:49:06.070
Egypt has one of the oldest
Bienniales of contemporary art.

01:49:06.070 --> 01:49:07.793
So it's almost as
old as the Venice

01:49:07.793 --> 01:49:10.400
Bienniale that's very famous.

01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.530
And so for 25
years, there's been

01:49:12.530 --> 01:49:16.710
every two years this event, this
art event, which is a disaster.

01:49:16.710 --> 01:49:21.360
And it's like a horror show.

01:49:21.360 --> 01:49:28.780
But that year,
December 2008, was

01:49:28.780 --> 01:49:30.540
one of the iterations
of the Bienniale.

01:49:30.540 --> 01:49:33.330
And for the first
time in 25 years,

01:49:33.330 --> 01:49:37.730
they changed the curators
from the Minister of Culture

01:49:37.730 --> 01:49:40.950
to two young men
that they appointed

01:49:40.950 --> 01:49:43.160
to be taking care of that event.

01:49:43.160 --> 01:49:46.760
And they asked me to be part of
the event, which was in itself

01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:49.240
crazy, because I'm a woman.

01:49:49.240 --> 01:49:54.200
I'm of Lebanese origin, so
I'm not a pure Egyptian.

01:49:54.200 --> 01:49:56.040
I'm Christian.

01:49:56.040 --> 01:50:00.070
I'm from the art world
that is more private, not

01:50:00.070 --> 01:50:04.190
the government type artist,
so all of the things

01:50:04.190 --> 01:50:06.120
that normally they hate.

01:50:06.120 --> 01:50:09.399
And so it was, like,
wow, they're inviting me.

01:50:09.399 --> 01:50:10.565
Of course I have to say yes.

01:50:10.565 --> 01:50:13.490
But I also have to make a
point of my participation.

01:50:13.490 --> 01:50:16.885
I don't want to just show
a collage or a piece that

01:50:16.885 --> 01:50:19.065
is an interesting piece,
but not in this context.

01:50:19.065 --> 01:50:22.510
So I want to actually respond
to where I'm going to show.

01:50:22.510 --> 01:50:24.750
So I wanted to do
a work in situ.

01:50:24.750 --> 01:50:27.740
And so I talked to the curator.

01:50:27.740 --> 01:50:30.330
And I told him that's my idea.

01:50:30.330 --> 01:50:31.940
I want to do this.

01:50:31.940 --> 01:50:34.580
And I was very lucky, because
he said, oh, my god, I'm

01:50:34.580 --> 01:50:36.990
really interested
in these areas.

01:50:36.990 --> 01:50:40.200
And he, because he was
one of the first ones--

01:50:40.200 --> 01:50:43.575
I mean, the first in 25 years
to have something really

01:50:43.575 --> 01:50:46.060
radically happening and
changing in that structure

01:50:46.060 --> 01:50:48.920
of the Bienniale, of course
he was happy to do something

01:50:48.920 --> 01:50:49.440
provocative.

01:50:49.440 --> 01:50:52.470
And he wanted to do
something provocative.

01:50:52.470 --> 01:50:54.950
And he wanted his
Bienniale to be successful.

01:50:54.950 --> 01:50:58.720
And already to choose
me was a problem.

01:50:58.720 --> 01:50:59.720
So it was really funny.

01:50:59.720 --> 01:51:01.710
So of course, he was
totally on my side.

01:51:01.710 --> 01:51:04.766
And so I negotiated to
have a piece of land,

01:51:04.766 --> 01:51:07.315
and to occupy this
little piece of land.

01:51:07.315 --> 01:51:09.190
And then I had the
gardener come and tell me,

01:51:09.190 --> 01:51:10.690
what are you doing
to my flowers?

01:51:10.690 --> 01:51:11.606
And I don't know what.

01:51:11.606 --> 01:51:14.310
I was, like, OK,
I'll do them again.

01:51:14.310 --> 01:51:15.710
Just leave me work.

01:51:15.710 --> 01:51:19.180
So it was very, very interesting
for all of these reasons,

01:51:19.180 --> 01:51:20.850
because everybody
was waiting to see

01:51:20.850 --> 01:51:23.800
what's going to happen, what
are they actually going to show?

01:51:23.800 --> 01:51:26.570
Is it really going
to make a difference?

01:51:26.570 --> 01:51:30.860
And it was a fascinating,
very exciting time.

01:51:30.860 --> 01:51:33.610
And the work was
really very engaging,

01:51:33.610 --> 01:51:36.800
because the people who built
the tower live in these areas.

01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:38.640
And when they understood
what I was doing,

01:51:38.640 --> 01:51:40.830
they became completely
in love with it.

01:51:40.830 --> 01:51:44.860
And then the people who
guard that military base are

01:51:44.860 --> 01:51:46.400
people who live in this area.

01:51:46.400 --> 01:51:48.480
So they actually came
and did their naps.

01:51:48.480 --> 01:51:52.020
They took naps inside my tower.

01:51:52.020 --> 01:51:55.380
The people who owned
the cafes around,

01:51:55.380 --> 01:51:59.240
the library and all of this
inside the garden surrounding

01:51:59.240 --> 01:52:02.260
became familiar with me
building this for two months,

01:52:02.260 --> 01:52:05.047
and then showing it
for another month.

01:52:05.047 --> 01:52:06.630
And so every time
there was a visitor,

01:52:06.630 --> 01:52:08.004
they would come
and offer coffee.

01:52:08.004 --> 01:52:09.650
So it became a cafe.

01:52:09.650 --> 01:52:10.830
I mean, it was incredible.

01:52:10.830 --> 01:52:13.885
And I would come in the morning,
and find these huge ashtrays

01:52:13.885 --> 01:52:15.000
full of cigarettes.

01:52:15.000 --> 01:52:16.907
I was, like, who
smoked all this?

01:52:16.907 --> 01:52:18.740
I would ask [INAUDIBLE]
who smoked all this?

01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:21.870
He was, like, well, the
Director of the Opera House

01:52:21.870 --> 01:52:25.380
came with his meeting, with
somebody he was meeting.

01:52:25.380 --> 01:52:28.620
And they stayed three
hours, and smoked all night.

01:52:28.620 --> 01:52:31.080
And so they were having
their meetings in that space.

01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.470
So that space
became like a space.

01:52:33.470 --> 01:52:34.480
It was super alive.

01:52:37.090 --> 01:52:42.839
And it was really interesting,
because it helped, sort of.

01:52:42.839 --> 01:52:44.380
People came to me
and said, you know,

01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:51.840
normally, we see these areas are
as crime-ridden, ugly, horrible

01:52:51.840 --> 01:52:52.620
people.

01:52:52.620 --> 01:52:55.680
They have very
negative connotation.

01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:58.760
And now I'm going to
go back to these areas

01:52:58.760 --> 01:53:01.150
and look at it from
a different angle.

01:53:01.150 --> 01:53:06.180
So it was this kind
of energy, and trying

01:53:06.180 --> 01:53:10.560
to bring people to look at
themselves in a different way

01:53:10.560 --> 01:53:12.220
and say, OK, wake up.

01:53:14.770 --> 01:53:18.140
PROFESSOR: Well, I wish we
had more time to discuss.

01:53:18.140 --> 01:53:20.360
It's so interesting,
all of this.

01:53:20.360 --> 01:53:25.650
But we need to do
another presentation.

01:53:25.650 --> 01:53:26.710
So I want to thank you.

01:53:26.710 --> 01:53:27.610
Let's applaud Lara.

01:53:27.610 --> 01:53:28.210
[APPLAUSE]

01:53:28.210 --> 01:53:29.760
LARA BALADI: Thank you.
