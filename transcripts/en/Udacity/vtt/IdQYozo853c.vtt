00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.680
The truth assignment that I
used is false, true, true.

00:00:03.680 --> 00:00:08.050
I used the rule that yi is equal to
the disjunction of the first i plus one

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:14.400
literals, and any satisfying assignment
yi being true implies this disjunction.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.430
But yi can sometimes be false,
even when this expression is true.

00:00:18.430 --> 00:00:23.460
For example, another way to extend
this assignment is to let y2 be false.

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:29.342
Regardless of how we set y2 this
clause here is still satisfied by x3,

00:00:29.342 --> 00:00:33.580
and this clause here is
still satisfied by x4 bar.

00:00:33.580 --> 00:00:37.170
Thus, there isn't a unique way to
extend the original assignment, but

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:39.980
it is true that this way of
extending it always works.
