first of all let me express my gratitude

00:00:11.629 --> 00:00:11.639
first of all let me express my gratitude
 

00:00:11.639 --> 00:00:14.539
first of all let me express my gratitude
to the course directors for allowing me

00:00:14.539 --> 00:00:14.549
to the course directors for allowing me
 

00:00:14.549 --> 00:00:16.970
to the course directors for allowing me
to do this yet a second year so I'm

00:00:16.970 --> 00:00:16.980
to do this yet a second year so I'm
 

00:00:16.980 --> 00:00:19.250
to do this yet a second year so I'm
amazed actually after the first time I

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:19.260
amazed actually after the first time I
 

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:21.980
amazed actually after the first time I
thought this was a marvelous class to be

00:00:21.980 --> 00:00:21.990
thought this was a marvelous class to be
 

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.250
thought this was a marvelous class to be
able to take as an undergraduate it's it

00:00:25.250 --> 00:00:25.260
able to take as an undergraduate it's it
 

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:27.980
able to take as an undergraduate it's it
really has been a interesting trip I've

00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:27.990
really has been a interesting trip I've
 

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.650
really has been a interesting trip I've
seen some of your exam questions and I

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.660
seen some of your exam questions and I
 

00:00:30.660 --> 00:00:34.040
seen some of your exam questions and I
don't envy you I thought to myself my

00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:34.050
don't envy you I thought to myself my
 

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:35.720
don't envy you I thought to myself my
god I couldn't answer these myself but

00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:35.730
god I couldn't answer these myself but
 

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:38.150
god I couldn't answer these myself but
by listening to this week in virology I

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.160
by listening to this week in virology I
 

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.610
by listening to this week in virology I
could actually discern the answers what

00:00:42.610 --> 00:00:42.620
 
 

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.990
 
that's right how many are there that's a

00:00:44.990 --> 00:00:45.000
that's right how many are there that's a
 

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.560
that's right how many are there that's a
very good question I'm sure everyone in

00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:48.570
very good question I'm sure everyone in
 

00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:51.080
very good question I'm sure everyone in
this room knows how many genomes there

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
this room knows how many genomes there
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.450
this room knows how many genomes there
are and how the reproduction cycle

00:00:53.450 --> 00:00:53.460
are and how the reproduction cycle
 

00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:57.619
are and how the reproduction cycle
begins it's something that I actually I

00:00:57.619 --> 00:00:57.629
begins it's something that I actually I
 

00:00:57.629 --> 00:00:59.479
begins it's something that I actually I
knew that at one time you know way back

00:00:59.479 --> 00:00:59.489
knew that at one time you know way back
 

00:00:59.489 --> 00:01:01.430
knew that at one time you know way back
in my undergraduate education but of

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:01.440
in my undergraduate education but of
 

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.990
in my undergraduate education but of
course I drifted off into another field

00:01:02.990 --> 00:01:03.000
course I drifted off into another field
 

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.469
course I drifted off into another field
called parasitism which well viruses are

00:01:06.469 --> 00:01:06.479
called parasitism which well viruses are
 

00:01:06.479 --> 00:01:07.850
called parasitism which well viruses are
parasites there's no question about it

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:07.860
parasites there's no question about it
 

00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:10.010
parasites there's no question about it
but they're so small that you can't see

00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:10.020
but they're so small that you can't see
 

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:12.260
but they're so small that you can't see
them I prefer parasites that you can see

00:01:12.260 --> 00:01:12.270
them I prefer parasites that you can see
 

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:14.420
them I prefer parasites that you can see
with your naked eye so I worked my whole

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:14.430
with your naked eye so I worked my whole
 

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:16.249
with your naked eye so I worked my whole
life on a parasite called Trichinella

00:01:16.249 --> 00:01:16.259
life on a parasite called Trichinella
 

00:01:16.259 --> 00:01:18.620
life on a parasite called Trichinella
spiralis which some of you might know as

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:18.630
spiralis which some of you might know as
 

00:01:18.630 --> 00:01:22.010
spiralis which some of you might know as
trichinosis which if you look at it in

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:22.020
trichinosis which if you look at it in
 

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.820
trichinosis which if you look at it in
the proper setting it's a very very very

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:25.830
the proper setting it's a very very very
 

00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:29.450
the proper setting it's a very very very
very large virus because it lives inside

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:29.460
very large virus because it lives inside
 

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.010
very large virus because it lives inside
of a cell but that's you know another

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:31.020
of a cell but that's you know another
 

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:32.749
of a cell but that's you know another
course I wouldn't do that to this course

00:01:32.749 --> 00:01:32.759
course I wouldn't do that to this course
 

00:01:32.759 --> 00:01:34.580
course I wouldn't do that to this course
I don't want to waste your time here but

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:34.590
I don't want to waste your time here but
 

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.140
I don't want to waste your time here but
just know that anything that affects you

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:36.150
just know that anything that affects you
 

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:38.420
just know that anything that affects you
that you can almost not see or that you

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:38.430
that you can almost not see or that you
 

00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:40.730
that you can almost not see or that you
could see but it isn't actually taking a

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:40.740
could see but it isn't actually taking a
 

00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:42.700
could see but it isn't actually taking a
bite out of you like a lion or a

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:42.710
bite out of you like a lion or a
 

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:46.550
bite out of you like a lion or a
predator those are probably parasites so

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:46.560
predator those are probably parasites so
 

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:48.410
predator those are probably parasites so
you can start at the very bottom of the

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:48.420
you can start at the very bottom of the
 

00:01:48.420 --> 00:01:50.770
you can start at the very bottom of the
scale of life and work right up to

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
scale of life and work right up to
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:53.120
scale of life and work right up to
insects some of them there are some

00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:53.130
insects some of them there are some
 

00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:54.770
insects some of them there are some
insects or arthropods that actually live

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:54.780
insects or arthropods that actually live
 

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.920
insects or arthropods that actually live
inside so today it's nice to know where

00:01:57.920 --> 00:01:57.930
inside so today it's nice to know where
 

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:00.200
inside so today it's nice to know where
these things come from and where they're

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:00.210
these things come from and where they're
 

00:02:00.210 --> 00:02:02.300
these things come from and where they're
going I can't tell you where this was

00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:02.310
going I can't tell you where this was
 

00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:03.499
going I can't tell you where this was
going although I can tell you where it's

00:02:03.499 --> 00:02:03.509
going although I can tell you where it's
 

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:09.499
going although I can tell you where it's
been so West Nile virus is a flabby

00:02:09.499 --> 00:02:09.509
been so West Nile virus is a flabby
 

00:02:09.509 --> 00:02:11.990
been so West Nile virus is a flabby
virus so you've heard about flaviviruses

00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:12.000
virus so you've heard about flaviviruses
 

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:12.890
virus so you've heard about flaviviruses
right

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:12.900
right
 

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:17.600
right
so what do you know about them come on

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:17.610
so what do you know about them come on
 

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:20.030
so what do you know about them come on
anybody just shot it out what does the

00:02:20.030 --> 00:02:20.040
anybody just shot it out what does the
 

00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:23.979
anybody just shot it out what does the
word mean whose Greek anybody here Greek

00:02:23.979 --> 00:02:23.989
word mean whose Greek anybody here Greek
 

00:02:23.989 --> 00:02:26.990
word mean whose Greek anybody here Greek
no nobody belongs to a fraternity or

00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:27.000
no nobody belongs to a fraternity or
 

00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.089
no nobody belongs to a fraternity or
sorority here all right so that's a good

00:02:32.089 --> 00:02:32.099
sorority here all right so that's a good
 

00:02:32.099 --> 00:02:36.050
sorority here all right so that's a good
thing actually so the word flavia is a

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.060
thing actually so the word flavia is a
 

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:39.280
thing actually so the word flavia is a
Greek word and it actually means yellow

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.290
Greek word and it actually means yellow
 

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.080
Greek word and it actually means yellow
so can you name another virus in that

00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:42.090
so can you name another virus in that
 

00:02:42.090 --> 00:02:46.339
so can you name another virus in that
group yellow fever exactly right and

00:02:46.339 --> 00:02:46.349
group yellow fever exactly right and
 

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.099
group yellow fever exactly right and
yellow fever played a huge role in the

00:02:49.099 --> 00:02:49.109
yellow fever played a huge role in the
 

00:02:49.109 --> 00:02:52.699
yellow fever played a huge role in the
history of this country pardon me in the

00:02:52.699 --> 00:02:52.709
history of this country pardon me in the
 

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:56.330
history of this country pardon me in the
history of our medical school because

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:56.340
history of our medical school because
 

00:02:56.340 --> 00:02:58.009
history of our medical school because
two of its graduates actually sacrificed

00:02:58.009 --> 00:02:58.019
two of its graduates actually sacrificed
 

00:02:58.019 --> 00:03:01.250
two of its graduates actually sacrificed
their lives trying to find out which

00:03:01.250 --> 00:03:01.260
their lives trying to find out which
 

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:05.479
their lives trying to find out which
vector or insect transmitted yellow

00:03:05.479 --> 00:03:05.489
vector or insect transmitted yellow
 

00:03:05.489 --> 00:03:08.869
vector or insect transmitted yellow
fever from person to person and all of

00:03:08.869 --> 00:03:08.879
fever from person to person and all of
 

00:03:08.879 --> 00:03:10.369
fever from person to person and all of
that was under the directorship of

00:03:10.369 --> 00:03:10.379
that was under the directorship of
 

00:03:10.379 --> 00:03:13.460
that was under the directorship of
Walter Reed who was a very young man at

00:03:13.460 --> 00:03:13.470
Walter Reed who was a very young man at
 

00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:15.440
Walter Reed who was a very young man at
that point but of course matured into an

00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:15.450
that point but of course matured into an
 

00:03:15.450 --> 00:03:17.930
that point but of course matured into an
older person and in fact if you've been

00:03:17.930 --> 00:03:17.940
older person and in fact if you've been
 

00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:19.430
older person and in fact if you've been
to Washington DC there's a whole

00:03:19.430 --> 00:03:19.440
to Washington DC there's a whole
 

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:21.949
to Washington DC there's a whole
hospital and a medical complex named

00:03:21.949 --> 00:03:21.959
hospital and a medical complex named
 

00:03:21.959 --> 00:03:25.610
hospital and a medical complex named
after Walter Reed who became very famous

00:03:25.610 --> 00:03:25.620
after Walter Reed who became very famous
 

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:29.649
after Walter Reed who became very famous
for his work in the army he essentially

00:03:29.649 --> 00:03:29.659
for his work in the army he essentially
 

00:03:29.659 --> 00:03:32.360
for his work in the army he essentially
allowed the Panama Canal to be to be

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:32.370
allowed the Panama Canal to be to be
 

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:33.860
allowed the Panama Canal to be to be
built because once we found out which

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:33.870
built because once we found out which
 

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.339
built because once we found out which
insect vector it was we could begin to

00:03:37.339 --> 00:03:37.349
insect vector it was we could begin to
 

00:03:37.349 --> 00:03:41.149
insect vector it was we could begin to
hone in on controlling it now it

00:03:41.149 --> 00:03:41.159
hone in on controlling it now it
 

00:03:41.159 --> 00:03:42.409
hone in on controlling it now it
shouldn't surprise you then to learn

00:03:42.409 --> 00:03:42.419
shouldn't surprise you then to learn
 

00:03:42.419 --> 00:03:45.140
shouldn't surprise you then to learn
that almost all the flabby viruses in

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:45.150
that almost all the flabby viruses in
 

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.030
that almost all the flabby viruses in
fact all of the flaviviruses that I can

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:47.040
fact all of the flaviviruses that I can
 

00:03:47.040 --> 00:03:49.399
fact all of the flaviviruses that I can
name are transmitted by vectors or

00:03:49.399 --> 00:03:49.409
name are transmitted by vectors or
 

00:03:49.409 --> 00:03:52.189
name are transmitted by vectors or
insects of some sort some are

00:03:52.189 --> 00:03:52.199
insects of some sort some are
 

00:03:52.199 --> 00:03:54.379
insects of some sort some are
transmitted by ticks as well and that

00:03:54.379 --> 00:03:54.389
transmitted by ticks as well and that
 

00:03:54.389 --> 00:03:55.759
transmitted by ticks as well and that
wouldn't be an insect that would be a

00:03:55.759 --> 00:03:55.769
wouldn't be an insect that would be a
 

00:03:55.769 --> 00:04:03.520
wouldn't be an insect that would be a
what an arachnid eight legs rather than

00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:03.530
what an arachnid eight legs rather than
 

00:04:03.530 --> 00:04:06.379
what an arachnid eight legs rather than
six legs it was the easy way to remember

00:04:06.379 --> 00:04:06.389
six legs it was the easy way to remember
 

00:04:06.389 --> 00:04:09.589
six legs it was the easy way to remember
that so if you want a vector for ticks

00:04:09.589 --> 00:04:09.599
that so if you want a vector for ticks
 

00:04:09.599 --> 00:04:10.939
that so if you want a vector for ticks
that everybody's familiar with Lyme

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:10.949
that everybody's familiar with Lyme
 

00:04:10.949 --> 00:04:12.050
that everybody's familiar with Lyme
disease would fall into that category

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:12.060
disease would fall into that category
 

00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:14.449
disease would fall into that category
right so that's something that you can

00:04:14.449 --> 00:04:14.459
right so that's something that you can
 

00:04:14.459 --> 00:04:17.240
right so that's something that you can
probably get right now in fact if you go

00:04:17.240 --> 00:04:17.250
probably get right now in fact if you go
 

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.699
probably get right now in fact if you go
head walking in the woods you're likely

00:04:19.699 --> 00:04:19.709
head walking in the woods you're likely
 

00:04:19.709 --> 00:04:22.730
head walking in the woods you're likely
to pick up tix and the ticks are likely

00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:22.740
to pick up tix and the ticks are likely
 

00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.070
to pick up tix and the ticks are likely
to have this infection inside of them

00:04:25.070 --> 00:04:25.080
to have this infection inside of them
 

00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.260
to have this infection inside of them
because about fifty percent of the tix

00:04:27.260 --> 00:04:27.270
because about fifty percent of the tix
 

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:30.409
because about fifty percent of the tix
of a particular species have Lyme

00:04:30.409 --> 00:04:30.419
of a particular species have Lyme
 

00:04:30.419 --> 00:04:32.029
of a particular species have Lyme
disease in there capable of transmitting

00:04:32.029 --> 00:04:32.039
disease in there capable of transmitting
 

00:04:32.039 --> 00:04:34.640
disease in there capable of transmitting
it is my voice okay tends to trail off

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:34.650
it is my voice okay tends to trail off
 

00:04:34.650 --> 00:04:38.869
it is my voice okay tends to trail off
at the end of my sentences so it's okay

00:04:38.869 --> 00:04:38.879
at the end of my sentences so it's okay
 

00:04:38.879 --> 00:04:41.179
at the end of my sentences so it's okay
so West Nile virus listen I'll where the

00:04:41.179 --> 00:04:41.189
so West Nile virus listen I'll where the
 

00:04:41.189 --> 00:04:44.209
so West Nile virus listen I'll where the
heck is is there a West Nile I mean I

00:04:44.209 --> 00:04:44.219
heck is is there a West Nile I mean I
 

00:04:44.219 --> 00:04:46.040
heck is is there a West Nile I mean I
named the story that I wrote after this

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:46.050
named the story that I wrote after this
 

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.529
named the story that I wrote after this
the West Nile story sort of as a little

00:04:48.529 --> 00:04:48.539
the West Nile story sort of as a little
 

00:04:48.539 --> 00:04:50.629
the West Nile story sort of as a little
plan when it's West Side Story West Nile

00:04:50.629 --> 00:04:50.639
plan when it's West Side Story West Nile
 

00:04:50.639 --> 00:04:54.230
plan when it's West Side Story West Nile
story but the way this actually works is

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:54.240
story but the way this actually works is
 

00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.909
story but the way this actually works is
kind of interesting because the West

00:04:55.909 --> 00:04:55.919
kind of interesting because the West
 

00:04:55.919 --> 00:04:59.749
kind of interesting because the West
Nile virus comes from the western

00:04:59.749 --> 00:04:59.759
Nile virus comes from the western
 

00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:03.920
Nile virus comes from the western
portion of Uganda it's west of the Nile

00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:03.930
portion of Uganda it's west of the Nile
 

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.439
portion of Uganda it's west of the Nile
River and then there are many branches

00:05:06.439 --> 00:05:06.449
River and then there are many branches
 

00:05:06.449 --> 00:05:09.260
River and then there are many branches
to the Nile River so the branch of the

00:05:09.260 --> 00:05:09.270
to the Nile River so the branch of the
 

00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:13.550
to the Nile River so the branch of the
river that it's west of is this branch

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:13.560
river that it's west of is this branch
 

00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:17.029
river that it's west of is this branch
right over here and here is where it was

00:05:17.029 --> 00:05:17.039
right over here and here is where it was
 

00:05:17.039 --> 00:05:18.080
right over here and here is where it was
first discovered and they of course

00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:18.090
first discovered and they of course
 

00:05:18.090 --> 00:05:21.350
first discovered and they of course
colored it in as a yellow area because

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:21.360
colored it in as a yellow area because
 

00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:24.439
colored it in as a yellow area because
it was a flat E virus if you look now

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:24.449
it was a flat E virus if you look now
 

00:05:24.449 --> 00:05:27.920
it was a flat E virus if you look now
where it's found its head its extended

00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:27.930
where it's found its head its extended
 

00:05:27.930 --> 00:05:32.480
where it's found its head its extended
its range so the real question is how

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:32.490
its range so the real question is how
 

00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:35.269
its range so the real question is how
did that virus ever come here what

00:05:35.269 --> 00:05:35.279
did that virus ever come here what
 

00:05:35.279 --> 00:05:36.709
did that virus ever come here what
brought it here how did we ever get

00:05:36.709 --> 00:05:36.719
brought it here how did we ever get
 

00:05:36.719 --> 00:05:38.420
brought it here how did we ever get
involved with it and what are the

00:05:38.420 --> 00:05:38.430
involved with it and what are the
 

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.700
involved with it and what are the
ramifications of that so that's what I'm

00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:40.710
ramifications of that so that's what I'm
 

00:05:40.710 --> 00:05:42.320
ramifications of that so that's what I'm
going to spend most of the time talking

00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:42.330
going to spend most of the time talking
 

00:05:42.330 --> 00:05:44.600
going to spend most of the time talking
about because as Vince must have told

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:44.610
about because as Vince must have told
 

00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.689
about because as Vince must have told
you before I'm not a virologist not by

you before I'm not a virologist not by
 

00:05:47.699 --> 00:05:50.059
you before I'm not a virologist not by
training not by application I had been

00:05:50.059 --> 00:05:50.069
training not by application I had been

dragged into this subject kicking and

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:52.110
dragged into this subject kicking and
 

00:05:52.110 --> 00:05:55.219
dragged into this subject kicking and
screaming by a wonderful teacher to be

00:05:55.219 --> 00:05:55.229
screaming by a wonderful teacher to be
 

00:05:55.229 --> 00:05:56.510
screaming by a wonderful teacher to be
honest with you when I was a graduate

00:05:56.510 --> 00:05:56.520
honest with you when I was a graduate
 

00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:58.249
honest with you when I was a graduate
student I went to Notre Dame for my

00:05:58.249 --> 00:05:58.259
student I went to Notre Dame for my
 

00:05:58.259 --> 00:06:02.089
student I went to Notre Dame for my
degree there weren't any parasitologists

00:06:02.089 --> 00:06:02.099
degree there weren't any parasitologists
 

00:06:02.099 --> 00:06:03.709
degree there weren't any parasitologists
there that studied the ones that you can

00:06:03.709 --> 00:06:03.719
there that studied the ones that you can
 

00:06:03.719 --> 00:06:06.860
there that studied the ones that you can
see they were all virologists except for

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:06.870
see they were all virologists except for
 

00:06:06.870 --> 00:06:09.140
see they were all virologists except for
me so every Saturday we would sit around

00:06:09.140 --> 00:06:09.150
me so every Saturday we would sit around
 

00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:11.360
me so every Saturday we would sit around
a table in the morning and listen to all

00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:11.370
a table in the morning and listen to all
 

00:06:11.370 --> 00:06:13.309
a table in the morning and listen to all
of the graduate students in the other

00:06:13.309 --> 00:06:13.319
of the graduate students in the other
 

00:06:13.319 --> 00:06:15.350
of the graduate students in the other
virology groups give their presentations

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:15.360
virology groups give their presentations
 

00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:18.619
virology groups give their presentations
and finally naturally I was last if

00:06:18.619 --> 00:06:18.629
and finally naturally I was last if
 

00:06:18.629 --> 00:06:22.110
and finally naturally I was last if
there was time

00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:22.120
 
 

00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:24.460
 
but it's okay because three of them

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:24.470
but it's okay because three of them
 

00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.930
but it's okay because three of them
didn't make it through and i did so

00:06:25.930 --> 00:06:25.940
didn't make it through and i did so
 

00:06:25.940 --> 00:06:29.140
didn't make it through and i did so
that's the way that goes so what we have

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:29.150
that's the way that goes so what we have
 

00:06:29.150 --> 00:06:32.409
that's the way that goes so what we have
here is a distribution map and it might

00:06:32.409 --> 00:06:32.419
here is a distribution map and it might
 

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.120
here is a distribution map and it might
be hard to see but it was on the Chris

00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:34.130
be hard to see but it was on the Chris
 

00:06:34.130 --> 00:06:35.200
be hard to see but it was on the Chris
works right so you could see these

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:35.210
works right so you could see these
 

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.260
works right so you could see these
things this is an interactive map that

things this is an interactive map that
 

00:06:38.270 --> 00:06:40.870
things this is an interactive map that
you can actually go to and push these

you can actually go to and push these
 

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:43.090
you can actually go to and push these
little red buttons and you can find out

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.100
little red buttons and you can find out
 

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.159
little red buttons and you can find out
information about the West Nile virus in

00:06:45.159 --> 00:06:45.169
information about the West Nile virus in
 

00:06:45.169 --> 00:06:48.400
information about the West Nile virus in
that country you'll notice now that

00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:48.410
that country you'll notice now that
 

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.080
that country you'll notice now that
there are little red dots all the way

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:50.090
there are little red dots all the way
 

00:06:50.090 --> 00:06:51.820
there are little red dots all the way
down through South America there's

00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:51.830
down through South America there's
 

00:06:51.830 --> 00:06:53.830
down through South America there's
nothing in Brazil yet but I'm sure that

00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:53.840
nothing in Brazil yet but I'm sure that
 

00:06:53.840 --> 00:06:55.659
nothing in Brazil yet but I'm sure that
it's there they just haven't looked for

00:06:55.659 --> 00:06:55.669
it's there they just haven't looked for
 

00:06:55.669 --> 00:06:58.330
it's there they just haven't looked for
it much the point is that it never used

00:06:58.330 --> 00:06:58.340
it much the point is that it never used
 

00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.409
it much the point is that it never used
to be here ever until nineteen ninety

00:07:02.409 --> 00:07:02.419
to be here ever until nineteen ninety
 

00:07:02.419 --> 00:07:06.610
to be here ever until nineteen ninety
nine that's pretty bizarre right here's

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:06.620
nine that's pretty bizarre right here's
 

00:07:06.620 --> 00:07:08.830
nine that's pretty bizarre right here's
an epicenter for a disease that we can

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:08.840
an epicenter for a disease that we can
 

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:11.140
an epicenter for a disease that we can
actually say started we can almost give

00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:11.150
actually say started we can almost give
 

00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:13.140
actually say started we can almost give
you the exact day that it started

00:07:13.140 --> 00:07:13.150
you the exact day that it started
 

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:15.370
you the exact day that it started
they're very few other things you can do

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:15.380
they're very few other things you can do
 

00:07:15.380 --> 00:07:18.010
they're very few other things you can do
that for in terms of infections another

00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:18.020
that for in terms of infections another
 

00:07:18.020 --> 00:07:19.450
that for in terms of infections another
one that I won't even tell you about

00:07:19.450 --> 00:07:19.460
one that I won't even tell you about
 

00:07:19.460 --> 00:07:21.580
one that I won't even tell you about
though is cholera believe it or not we

00:07:21.580 --> 00:07:21.590
though is cholera believe it or not we
 

00:07:21.590 --> 00:07:23.520
though is cholera believe it or not we
know exactly when that one started to

00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:23.530
know exactly when that one started to
 

00:07:23.530 --> 00:07:28.150
know exactly when that one started to
back in the 1800s so the transmission

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:28.160
back in the 1800s so the transmission
 

00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.980
back in the 1800s so the transmission
cycle for West Nile virus is pretty

00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:29.990
cycle for West Nile virus is pretty
 

00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:32.200
cycle for West Nile virus is pretty
straightforward you have to be an

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:32.210
straightforward you have to be an
 

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:35.890
straightforward you have to be an
infected animal first and along comes a

00:07:35.890 --> 00:07:35.900
infected animal first and along comes a
 

00:07:35.900 --> 00:07:38.260
infected animal first and along comes a
mosquito and the mosquitoes how many

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.270
mosquito and the mosquitoes how many
 

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:39.580
mosquito and the mosquitoes how many
people here have ever been bitten by a

00:07:39.580 --> 00:07:39.590
people here have ever been bitten by a
 

00:07:39.590 --> 00:07:43.150
people here have ever been bitten by a
mosquito be honest I should have said

00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:43.160
mosquito be honest I should have said
 

00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.379
mosquito be honest I should have said
how many people have never been bitten

00:07:44.379 --> 00:07:44.389
how many people have never been bitten
 

00:07:44.389 --> 00:07:46.450
how many people have never been bitten
by a mosquito I want to sit next to you

00:07:46.450 --> 00:07:46.460
by a mosquito I want to sit next to you
 

00:07:46.460 --> 00:07:49.029
by a mosquito I want to sit next to you
oh you want me to sit next to you I

00:07:49.029 --> 00:07:49.039
oh you want me to sit next to you I
 

00:07:49.039 --> 00:07:51.010
oh you want me to sit next to you I
don't know I always gets the mosquitoes

00:07:51.010 --> 00:07:51.020
don't know I always gets the mosquitoes
 

00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:53.680
don't know I always gets the mosquitoes
mosquitoes are attracted to me and my

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:53.690
mosquitoes are attracted to me and my
 

00:07:53.690 --> 00:07:55.120
mosquitoes are attracted to me and my
wife loves sitting next to me for that

00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:55.130
wife loves sitting next to me for that
 

00:07:55.130 --> 00:07:56.740
wife loves sitting next to me for that
reason because they're less attracted to

00:07:56.740 --> 00:07:56.750
reason because they're less attracted to
 

00:07:56.750 --> 00:07:58.960
reason because they're less attracted to
her then you understand why mosquitoes

00:07:58.960 --> 00:07:58.970
her then you understand why mosquitoes
 

00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:06.040
her then you understand why mosquitoes
seek out people you tend to emit co2 in

00:08:06.040 --> 00:08:06.050
seek out people you tend to emit co2 in
 

00:08:06.050 --> 00:08:08.379

prefer it means a lot of them even
 

00:09:07.279 --> 00:09:08.620
prefer it means a lot of them even
though they don't prefer humans will

00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:08.630
though they don't prefer humans will

desperate for egg production and you all

00:09:14.439 --> 00:09:14.449
desperate for egg production and you all
 

00:09:14.449 --> 00:09:16.030
desperate for egg production and you all
know that it's the female mosquito that

00:09:16.030 --> 00:09:16.040
know that it's the female mosquito that
 

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.769
know that it's the female mosquito that
does the biting right when they all sort

00:09:17.769 --> 00:09:17.779
does the biting right when they all sort
 

00:09:17.779 --> 00:09:21.610
does the biting right when they all sort
of like we made it and she went off I

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:21.620
of like we made it and she went off I
 

00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:24.280
of like we made it and she went off I
don't know where she is but they both

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:24.290
don't know where she is but they both
 

00:09:24.290 --> 00:09:26.710
don't know where she is but they both
feed on something else they both feed on

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:26.720
feed on something else they both feed on
 

00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:29.910
feed on something else they both feed on
plant uses they actually suck out the

00:09:29.910 --> 00:09:29.920
plant uses they actually suck out the
 

00:09:29.920 --> 00:09:32.980
plant uses they actually suck out the
sugary portion of a plant and that's

00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:32.990
sugary portion of a plant and that's
 

00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:35.769
sugary portion of a plant and that's
what they use for their own food so in

00:09:35.769 --> 00:09:35.779
what they use for their own food so in
 

00:09:35.779 --> 00:09:37.030
what they use for their own food so in
order to produce eggs you need a lot

00:09:37.030 --> 00:09:37.040
order to produce eggs you need a lot
 

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:39.100
order to produce eggs you need a lot
more protein than just a sugary solution

00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:39.110
more protein than just a sugary solution
 

00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:41.259
more protein than just a sugary solution
so that's why the female mosquitoes bite

00:09:41.259 --> 00:09:41.269
so that's why the female mosquitoes bite
 

00:09:41.269 --> 00:09:43.949
so that's why the female mosquitoes bite
because they suck your blood they then

00:09:43.949 --> 00:09:43.959
because they suck your blood they then

plasmapheresis anybody here familiar
 

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.689
plasmapheresis anybody here familiar
with plasmapheresis you take you're

00:09:49.689 --> 00:09:49.699
with plasmapheresis you take you're
 

00:09:49.699 --> 00:09:56.290
with plasmapheresis you take you're
nodding your head what is it yes this is

00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:56.300
nodding your head what is it yes this is
 

00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:00.430
nodding your head what is it yes this is
a good so so that means in order to

00:10:00.430 --> 00:10:00.440
a good so so that means in order to
 

00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:01.780
a good so so that means in order to
explain a lot they can just talk to each

00:10:01.780 --> 00:10:01.790
explain a lot they can just talk to each
 

00:10:01.790 --> 00:10:03.220
explain a lot they can just talk to each
other and fight at the whole thing right

other and fight at the whole thing right
 

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.439
other and fight at the whole thing right
so plasmapheresis is right you take that

00:10:05.439 --> 00:10:05.449
so plasmapheresis is right you take that
 

00:10:05.449 --> 00:10:07.360
so plasmapheresis is right you take that
the formed elements out of the blood and

00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:07.370
the formed elements out of the blood and
 

00:10:07.370 --> 00:10:09.639
the formed elements out of the blood and
you pack them down and those are packed

00:10:09.639 --> 00:10:09.649
you pack them down and those are packed

this mosquito species all of the females
 

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:26.800
this mosquito species all of the females
they pack the blood cells into their

00:10:26.800 --> 00:10:26.810
they pack the blood cells into their
 

00:10:26.810 --> 00:10:28.990
they pack the blood cells into their
diverticula in their in their abdomen

00:10:28.990 --> 00:10:29.000
diverticula in their in their abdomen
 

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.660
diverticula in their in their abdomen
and they throw away the serum park you

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:31.670
and they throw away the serum park you
 

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.730
and they throw away the serum park you
don't want they just store the red cells

00:10:33.730 --> 00:10:33.740
don't want they just store the red cells
 

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.350
don't want they just store the red cells
then they digest them and then they use

00:10:35.350 --> 00:10:35.360
then they digest them and then they use
 

00:10:35.360 --> 00:10:38.290
then they digest them and then they use
that protein to make eggs so that's why

00:10:38.290 --> 00:10:38.300
that protein to make eggs so that's why
 

00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.139
that protein to make eggs so that's why
they bite us they live we're about two

00:10:41.139 --> 00:10:41.149

those are nasty infections and then

00:13:14.410 --> 00:13:14.420
those are nasty infections and then
 

00:13:14.420 --> 00:13:15.940
those are nasty infections and then
you've got the West Nile infection which

00:13:15.940 --> 00:13:15.950
you've got the West Nile infection which
 

00:13:15.950 --> 00:13:18.009
you've got the West Nile infection which
is not so nasty depending on how old you

00:13:18.009 --> 00:13:18.019
is not so nasty depending on how old you
 

00:13:18.019 --> 00:13:21.550
is not so nasty depending on how old you
are so it's primarily a parasite of

00:13:21.550 --> 00:13:21.560
are so it's primarily a parasite of
 

00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:26.440
are so it's primarily a parasite of
horses and mosquitoes yeah that's not

00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:26.450
horses and mosquitoes yeah that's not
 

00:13:26.450 --> 00:13:28.949
horses and mosquitoes yeah that's not
true it's a primary a parasite of

00:13:28.949 --> 00:13:28.959
true it's a primary a parasite of
 

00:13:28.959 --> 00:13:32.769
true it's a primary a parasite of
insects and humans no that's not true

00:13:32.769 --> 00:13:32.779
insects and humans no that's not true
 

00:13:32.779 --> 00:13:36.970
insects and humans no that's not true
either it's a parasite of birds it's a

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:36.980
either it's a parasite of birds it's a
 

00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:39.759
either it's a parasite of birds it's a
bird parasite just like lacrosse virus

00:13:39.759 --> 00:13:39.769
bird parasite just like lacrosse virus
 

00:13:39.769 --> 00:13:43.660
bird parasite just like lacrosse virus
is a bird parasite and st. Louis

00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:43.670
is a bird parasite and st. Louis
 

00:13:43.670 --> 00:13:45.579
is a bird parasite and st. Louis
encephalitis is another one of those

00:13:45.579 --> 00:13:45.589
encephalitis is another one of those
 

00:13:45.589 --> 00:13:47.860
encephalitis is another one of those
flabby group viruses and that too is a

00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:47.870
flabby group viruses and that too is a
 

00:13:47.870 --> 00:13:50.980
flabby group viruses and that too is a
parasite of birds and mosquitoes so you

00:13:50.980 --> 00:13:50.990
parasite of birds and mosquitoes so you
 

00:13:50.990 --> 00:13:53.620
parasite of birds and mosquitoes so you
did you know that mosquitoes fed on

00:13:53.620 --> 00:13:53.630
did you know that mosquitoes fed on
 

00:13:53.630 --> 00:13:56.050
did you know that mosquitoes fed on
birds yeah probably hadn't thought about

00:13:56.050 --> 00:13:56.060
birds yeah probably hadn't thought about
 

00:13:56.060 --> 00:13:58.150
birds yeah probably hadn't thought about
it right why would you think about it

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.160
it right why would you think about it
 

00:13:58.160 --> 00:14:01.720
it right why would you think about it
until just now so these it will bite

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:01.730
until just now so these it will bite
 

00:14:01.730 --> 00:14:04.389
until just now so these it will bite

contiguous United States you have heard
 

00:23:58.890 --> 00:24:00.800
contiguous United States you have heard
of this infection because there has been

00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:00.810
of this infection because there has been
 

00:24:00.810 --> 00:24:03.440
of this infection because there has been
an infection in your state but it will

now the other thing about this infection

00:24:14.090 --> 00:24:14.100
now the other thing about this infection
 

00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:16.100
now the other thing about this infection
is that it affects older people rather

00:24:16.100 --> 00:24:16.110
is that it affects older people rather
 

00:24:16.110 --> 00:24:20.870
is that it affects older people rather
than younger people adversely so if

00:24:20.870 --> 00:24:20.880
than younger people adversely so if
 

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.060

wind was blowing the mosquitoes from
 

00:45:20.119 --> 00:45:22.359
wind was blowing the mosquitoes from
east to west because it blows in the

00:45:22.359 --> 00:45:22.369
east to west because it blows in the
 

00:45:22.369 --> 00:45:24.700

so it's kind of hard to fly when you're

00:45:45.370 --> 00:45:45.380
so it's kind of hard to fly when you're
 

00:45:45.380 --> 00:45:50.200
so it's kind of hard to fly when you're
sick there is one way though that I can

think of it's complicated but it

00:45:52.750 --> 00:45:52.760
think of it's complicated but it
 

00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.829
think of it's complicated but it
probably is going to turn out to be the

years not bad so how does that work

00:46:05.790 --> 00:46:05.800

can you build a highway through a forest

00:46:56.130 --> 00:46:56.140
can you build a highway through a forest

can you build a highway through a forest
lots of them right eat and you had an

lots of them right eat and you had an
 

00:46:59.299 --> 00:47:01.660
lots of them right eat and you had an

00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:01.670
intact ecosystem the forest and you cut
 

00:47:01.670 --> 00:47:04.120
intact ecosystem the forest and you cut
it in half with this road and the next

thing you know you've got unusual things

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:05.599
thing you know you've got unusual things
 

00:47:05.599 --> 00:47:08.289

animals that only occupy that zone
that's bizarre but that's the way it is

00:47:14.710 --> 00:47:14.720
that's bizarre but that's the way it is

that's bizarre but that's the way it is
that's called the edge effect you might

00:47:17.200 --> 00:47:17.210
that's called the edge effect you might
 

00:47:17.210 --> 00:47:18.910
that's called the edge effect you might
have known the ecotone as the edge

00:47:18.910 --> 00:47:18.920
have known the ecotone as the edge
 

00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:23.019
have known the ecotone as the edge
effect yes okay we had a connection here

00:47:23.019 --> 00:47:23.029
effect yes okay we had a connection here
 

00:47:23.029 --> 00:47:26.200
effect yes okay we had a connection here
so we've we've built up these road

00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:26.210
so we've we've built up these road
 

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:28.059
so we've we've built up these road

particularly after the Second World War
so we've got all these east-west roads

00:47:33.279 --> 00:47:33.289
so we've got all these east-west roads
 

00:47:33.289 --> 00:47:34.390
so we've got all these east-west roads
and we've got all these north-south

00:47:34.390 --> 00:47:34.400
and we've got all these north-south
 

00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:37.839
and we've got all these north-south
roads and those are the eco tons that I

00:47:37.839 --> 00:47:37.849
roads and those are the eco tons that I
 

00:47:37.849 --> 00:47:39.700
roads and those are the eco tons that I
think are transmitting this infection

00:47:39.700 --> 00:47:39.710
think are transmitting this infection
 

00:47:39.710 --> 00:47:42.039
think are transmitting this infection
from one place to the next because crows

00:47:42.039 --> 00:47:42.049
from one place to the next because crows
 

00:47:42.049 --> 00:47:45.309
from one place to the next because crows
are the main host and crows eat

00:47:45.309 --> 00:47:45.319
are the main host and crows eat
 

00:47:45.319 --> 00:47:48.069
are the main host and crows eat

alongside the road and what are they
 

00:47:48.079 --> 00:47:50.170
alongside the road and what are they
eating they're eating bugs that bounce

but in this case it was a thank you that

00:51:52.790 --> 00:51:52.800
but in this case it was a thank you that
 

00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:54.440

what was it was a half of the peace sign

00:52:04.010 --> 00:52:04.020
what was it was a half of the peace sign

actually so he said for so for every 10

00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:07.050

degrees of bile of temperature the
 

00:52:11.190 --> 00:52:15.260
degrees of bile of temperature the
reaction time doubles and that's true

00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:15.270
reaction time doubles and that's true
 

00:52:15.270 --> 00:52:18.470

a little demonstration as to how serious

00:54:40.430 --> 00:54:40.440
a little demonstration as to how serious
 

00:54:40.440 --> 00:54:42.710

they were about keeping this poison so

00:54:42.710 --> 00:54:42.720
they were about keeping this poison so
 

00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:45.789
they were about keeping this poison so
in five separate city parks on one day

00:54:45.789 --> 00:54:45.799
in five separate city parks on one day
 

00:54:45.799 --> 00:54:49.130
in five separate city parks on one day
hundreds and thousands of birds were

00:54:49.130 --> 00:54:49.140
hundreds and thousands of birds were
 

00:54:49.140 --> 00:54:52.370
hundreds and thousands of birds were
dead eating these little pellets and so

00:54:52.370 --> 00:54:52.380
dead eating these little pellets and so
 

00:54:52.380 --> 00:54:53.690
dead eating these little pellets and so
then they thought no maybe they're dying

00:54:53.690 --> 00:54:53.700
then they thought no maybe they're dying
 

00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:56.839
then they thought no maybe they're dying
from that but of course that wasn't the

00:54:56.839 --> 00:54:56.849
from that but of course that wasn't the
 

00:54:56.849 --> 00:54:58.670
from that but of course that wasn't the
case but it threw them off a little bit

00:54:58.670 --> 00:54:58.680
case but it threw them off a little bit
 

00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:01.970
case but it threw them off a little bit
in 1999 they never caught those people

00:55:01.970 --> 00:55:01.980
in 1999 they never caught those people
 

00:55:01.980 --> 00:55:03.710
in 1999 they never caught those people
by the way so what's the difference

00:55:03.710 --> 00:55:03.720
by the way so what's the difference
 

00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:08.470
by the way so what's the difference
between Donald Trump and hot dog

00:55:08.470 --> 00:55:08.480
 
 

00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:10.420
 
Oh would you saw that joke come on

you're just being polite my wife is

00:55:12.520 --> 00:55:12.530
you're just being polite my wife is
 

00:55:12.530 --> 00:55:14.560
you're just being polite my wife is
right about this then she said no one

00:55:14.560 --> 00:55:14.570
right about this then she said no one
 

00:55:14.570 --> 00:55:16.240

laughs at your jokes they're just being

00:55:16.240 --> 00:55:16.250
laughs at your jokes they're just being
 

00:55:16.250 --> 00:55:22.060
laughs at your jokes they're just being
polite she's probably right so what

00:55:22.060 --> 00:55:22.070
polite she's probably right so what
 

00:55:22.070 --> 00:55:24.599
polite she's probably right so what
about the change of atap mortality rates

00:55:24.599 --> 00:55:24.609
about the change of atap mortality rates
 

00:55:24.609 --> 00:55:27.250
about the change of atap mortality rates
here's it went up to as high as fifteen

00:55:27.250 --> 00:55:27.260
here's it went up to as high as fifteen
 

00:55:27.260 --> 00:55:29.290
here's it went up to as high as fifteen
percent if you throughout Texas it was

00:55:29.290 --> 00:55:29.300
percent if you throughout Texas it was
 

00:55:29.300 --> 00:55:32.140
percent if you throughout Texas it was
around seven percent so we think the

00:55:32.140 --> 00:55:32.150
around seven percent so we think the
 

00:55:32.150 --> 00:55:33.430
around seven percent so we think the
difference is between Texas and

00:55:33.430 --> 00:55:33.440
difference is between Texas and
 

00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.590
difference is between Texas and
California it's not the same as hot dogs

00:55:35.590 --> 00:55:35.600
California it's not the same as hot dogs
 

00:55:35.600 --> 00:55:38.470
California it's not the same as hot dogs
and Donald Trump there's something in

00:55:38.470 --> 00:55:38.480
and Donald Trump there's something in
 

00:55:38.480 --> 00:55:41.590
and Donald Trump there's something in
common between Texas and in California

00:55:41.590 --> 00:55:41.600
common between Texas and in California
 

00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:43.690
common between Texas and in California
they both accept lots of migrant workers

00:55:43.690 --> 00:55:43.700
they both accept lots of migrant workers
 

00:55:43.700 --> 00:55:48.580
they both accept lots of migrant workers

they are there in the middle of a
 

01:00:18.790 --> 01:00:21.570
they are there in the middle of a
goddamn desert what the hell are you

01:00:21.570 --> 01:00:21.580
goddamn desert what the hell are you

doing playing golf in the middle of a

01:00:23.010 --> 01:00:23.020
doing playing golf in the middle of a
 

01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:25.380
doing playing golf in the middle of a
desert and they want it to look like

01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:25.390
desert and they want it to look like
 

01:00:25.390 --> 01:00:27.120
desert and they want it to look like
it's not in the middle of a desert so

01:00:27.120 --> 01:00:27.130
it's not in the middle of a desert so
 

01:00:27.130 --> 01:00:28.500
it's not in the middle of a desert so
they water the heck out of it they have

01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:28.510
they water the heck out of it they have
 

01:00:28.510 --> 01:00:31.800
they water the heck out of it they have
greens and fairways and lots of dripping

01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:31.810
greens and fairways and lots of dripping
 

01:00:31.810 --> 01:00:36.330
greens and fairways and lots of dripping
water lots of discarded water well

01:00:36.330 --> 01:00:36.340
water lots of discarded water well
 

01:00:36.340 --> 01:00:38.100
water lots of discarded water well
they're their own worst enemies then

01:00:38.100 --> 01:00:38.110
they're their own worst enemies then
 

01:00:38.110 --> 01:00:40.380
they're their own worst enemies then
because I can predict with surety that

01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:40.390
because I can predict with surety that
 

01:00:40.390 --> 01:00:42.900
because I can predict with surety that
eventually on West Nile virus outbreak

01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:42.910
eventually on West Nile virus outbreak
 

01:00:42.910 --> 01:00:44.790
eventually on West Nile virus outbreak
will occur there in fact I'm predicting

01:00:44.790 --> 01:00:44.800
will occur there in fact I'm predicting
 

01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.320
will occur there in fact I'm predicting
the past because it happened last year

01:00:48.320 --> 01:00:48.330
 
 

01:00:48.330 --> 01:00:52.040
 
the other thing I worry about a lot is

the other thing I worry about a lot is
 

01:00:52.050 --> 01:00:56.370
the other thing I worry about a lot is
exotic western birds have you visited

exotic western birds have you visited
the Everglades yeah you're seeing

01:00:58.890 --> 01:00:58.900
the Everglades yeah you're seeing
 

01:00:58.900 --> 01:01:01.590
the Everglades yeah you're seeing
spoonbills and ibises and storks and

01:01:01.590 --> 01:01:01.600
spoonbills and ibises and storks and
 

01:01:01.600 --> 01:01:03.930
spoonbills and ibises and storks and
stuff is that cool it's great we've got

01:01:03.930 --> 01:01:03.940
stuff is that cool it's great we've got
 

01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.760
stuff is that cool it's great we've got
a country that has that stuff in it

01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:05.770
a country that has that stuff in it
 

01:01:05.770 --> 01:01:07.710
a country that has that stuff in it
right we didn't make ladies hats out of

01:01:07.710 --> 01:01:07.720
right we didn't make ladies hats out of
 

01:01:07.720 --> 01:01:10.890
right we didn't make ladies hats out of
all of it we tried but then they

01:01:10.890 --> 01:01:10.900
all of it we tried but then they
 

01:01:10.900 --> 01:01:13.620
all of it we tried but then they
switched fashions or something else and

01:01:13.620 --> 01:01:13.630
switched fashions or something else and
 

01:01:13.630 --> 01:01:16.110
switched fashions or something else and
so we stopped that so all these exotic

01:01:16.110 --> 01:01:16.120
so we stopped that so all these exotic
 

01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.820
so we stopped that so all these exotic
birds are down there and we know that

01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:17.830
birds are down there and we know that
 

01:01:17.830 --> 01:01:19.590
birds are down there and we know that
they're highly susceptible to this

01:01:19.590 --> 01:01:19.600
they're highly susceptible to this
 

01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:24.450
they're highly susceptible to this

nothing to do because that my ticket was
 

01:01:35.800 --> 01:01:38.430
nothing to do because that my ticket was
from april to a second so i took a trip

from april to a second so i took a trip
 

01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.320

and I said you should ask me what I did
 

01:02:23.470 --> 01:02:25.020

rather than what i do now I'm retired

01:02:25.020 --> 01:02:25.030
rather than what i do now I'm retired
 

01:02:25.030 --> 01:02:27.330
rather than what i do now I'm retired
but what i did was i worked on

01:02:27.330 --> 01:02:27.340
but what i did was i worked on
 

01:02:27.340 --> 01:02:29.220

I'm really worried now that I know that

the center is here I'm worried about

the center is here I'm worried about
 

01:02:33.310 --> 01:02:37.110
the center is here I'm worried about
your cranes because West Nile virus is a

01:02:37.110 --> 01:02:37.120
your cranes because West Nile virus is a
 

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:40.320
your cranes because West Nile virus is a
baddie and the grill crowned crane will

01:02:40.320 --> 01:02:40.330
baddie and the grill crowned crane will
 

01:02:40.330 --> 01:02:42.870
baddie and the grill crowned crane will
not die that's an African bird in fact I

01:02:42.870 --> 01:02:42.880
not die that's an African bird in fact I
 

01:02:42.880 --> 01:02:45.390
not die that's an African bird in fact I
actually saw that bird once in Kenya so

01:02:45.390 --> 01:02:45.400
actually saw that bird once in Kenya so
 

01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:47.160
actually saw that bird once in Kenya so
I know where it comes from but the

01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:47.170
I know where it comes from but the
 

01:02:47.170 --> 01:02:48.660
I know where it comes from but the
sandhill cranes are certainly

01:02:48.660 --> 01:02:48.670
sandhill cranes are certainly
 

01:02:48.670 --> 01:02:50.790
sandhill cranes are certainly
susceptible to this and so were a lot of

01:02:50.790 --> 01:02:50.800
susceptible to this and so were a lot of
 

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.550
susceptible to this and so were a lot of
the other species Siberian cranes is

01:02:53.550 --> 01:02:53.560
the other species Siberian cranes is

the other species Siberian cranes is
only about he said they're about 50 left

01:02:55.500 --> 01:02:55.510
only about he said they're about 50 left

only about he said they're about 50 left
and he was involved in the recovery of

think the genetics of that is when the

01:03:25.440 --> 01:03:25.450
think the genetics of that is when the
 

01:03:25.450 --> 01:03:27.870
think the genetics of that is when the
MHC complex comes down to 11 individuals

01:03:27.870 --> 01:03:27.880
MHC complex comes down to 11 individuals

MHC complex comes down to 11 individuals
I think they're all inbred and now I

01:03:31.350 --> 01:03:31.360
I think they're all inbred and now I
 

01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:33.060
I think they're all inbred and now I
asked him it has anybody been doing the

01:03:33.060 --> 01:03:33.070
asked him it has anybody been doing the
 

01:03:33.070 --> 01:03:34.350
asked him it has anybody been doing the
genetics of this because they're now

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:34.360
genetics of this because they're now
 

01:03:34.360 --> 01:03:36.270
genetics of this because they're now
radiating back out again what's the

01:03:36.270 --> 01:03:36.280
radiating back out again what's the
 

01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:38.840
radiating back out again what's the
mutation rate in in whooping cranes

01:03:38.840 --> 01:03:38.850
mutation rate in in whooping cranes
 

01:03:38.850 --> 01:03:41.610
mutation rate in in whooping cranes
because they better mutate fast enough

01:03:41.610 --> 01:03:41.620
because they better mutate fast enough
 

01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:43.320
because they better mutate fast enough
to become resistant to them well that's

01:03:43.320 --> 01:03:43.330
to become resistant to them well that's
 

01:03:43.330 --> 01:03:45.270
to become resistant to them well that's
not going to happen either it area

01:03:45.270 --> 01:03:45.280
not going to happen either it area

now further west and I actually got a

01:03:56.610 --> 01:03:56.620
now further west and I actually got a
 

01:03:56.620 --> 01:03:59.040
now further west and I actually got a

potential at least but it's in the

01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:13.010
potential at least but it's in the
 

01:04:13.010 --> 01:04:15.160

hasn't worked out very well they tried

01:06:50.170 --> 01:06:50.180
hasn't worked out very well they tried
 

01:06:50.180 --> 01:06:51.970
hasn't worked out very well they tried
to piggyback that onto an attenuated

01:06:51.970 --> 01:06:51.980
to piggyback that onto an attenuated
 

01:06:51.980 --> 01:06:54.099
to piggyback that onto an attenuated
yellow fever virus because that's the

01:06:54.099 --> 01:06:54.109
yellow fever virus because that's the
 

01:06:54.109 --> 01:06:57.430
yellow fever virus because that's the
best vaccine in the world where none for

01:06:57.430 --> 01:06:57.440
best vaccine in the world where none for
 

01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:00.040
best vaccine in the world where none for
viruses it was one of the first it's an

01:07:00.040 --> 01:07:00.050
viruses it was one of the first it's an
 

01:07:00.050 --> 01:07:02.230
viruses it was one of the first it's an
attenuated viral vaccine they just

01:07:02.230 --> 01:07:02.240
attenuated viral vaccine they just
 

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:03.880
attenuated viral vaccine they just
passage it through animals until it

01:07:03.880 --> 01:07:03.890
passage it through animals until it
 

01:07:03.890 --> 01:07:05.620
passage it through animals until it
doesn't kill them anymore and then you

01:07:05.620 --> 01:07:05.630
doesn't kill them anymore and then you
 

01:07:05.630 --> 01:07:09.640
doesn't kill them anymore and then you
use that they don't know why but it did

01:07:09.640 --> 01:07:09.650
use that they don't know why but it did
 

01:07:09.650 --> 01:07:11.800
use that they don't know why but it did
so if you take this and you insert the

01:07:11.800 --> 01:07:11.810
so if you take this and you insert the
 

01:07:11.810 --> 01:07:15.250
so if you take this and you insert the
genome for the capsid for West Nile that

01:07:15.250 --> 01:07:15.260
genome for the capsid for West Nile that
 

01:07:15.260 --> 01:07:16.839
genome for the capsid for West Nile that

with it see I don't know anything about
biology I know that much that's not a

01:07:25.180 --> 01:07:25.190
biology I know that much that's not a

01:07:31.940 --> 01:07:36.340
 
sure yeah that's a great question too

01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:36.350
sure yeah that's a great question too
 

01:07:36.350 --> 01:07:37.960
sure yeah that's a great question too
because how would you know if you had it

01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:37.970
because how would you know if you had it
 

01:07:37.970 --> 01:07:42.280
because how would you know if you had it
and how how could you make a decision in

01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:42.290
and how how could you make a decision in
 

01:07:42.290 --> 01:07:44.710
and how how could you make a decision in
a clinical situation which has nothing

01:07:44.710 --> 01:07:44.720
a clinical situation which has nothing
 

01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:47.950

that a syndrome so there's a West Nile
 

01:07:50.270 --> 01:07:51.520
that a syndrome so there's a West Nile
syndrome now that they can actually

this could be used by bioterrorists to
 

01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:34.950
this could be used by bioterrorists to
introduce a vector borne disease and

01:12:34.950 --> 01:12:34.960
introduce a vector borne disease and
 

01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:37.740

they know what the pattern is now so

01:12:37.740 --> 01:12:37.750
they know what the pattern is now so

they could try something like this with
a much more virulent organism so you're

01:12:42.899 --> 01:12:42.909
a much more virulent organism so you're
 

01:12:42.909 --> 01:12:44.520
a much more virulent organism so you're
worried about bioterrorism just

01:12:44.520 --> 01:12:44.530
