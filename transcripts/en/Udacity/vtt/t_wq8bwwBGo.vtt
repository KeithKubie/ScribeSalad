00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:01.990
So if you take this scenario on the left here,

00:00:01.990 --> 00:00:04.910
we see that the mRNA copy is exactly the same

00:00:04.910 --> 00:00:08.340
link that is the DNA gene. Well, if this is

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.050
true then that means that nothing was spliced out. No

00:00:12.050 --> 00:00:16.480
entrons left, in which case we have one xon. We

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:19.170
have one full xon that takes up the whole length

00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:22.840
of the gene. Now, on the scenario in the right,

00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.420
you see that our mRNA copy is in fact shorter than

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.420
a DNA gene. So, this does tell us that there's some splicing going on,

00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:34.260
and introns are being cut out, and some exons are being retained. But you can

00:00:34.260 --> 00:00:38.810
tell that we don't have any demarcation here where the introns and exons are, we

00:00:38.810 --> 00:00:44.920
just know that there are some. So we can't determine exactly how many we have.
