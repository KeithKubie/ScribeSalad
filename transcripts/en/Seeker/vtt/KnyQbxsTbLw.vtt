00:00:00.149 --> 00:00:03.170
This episode of DNews is brought to you by
the Toyota Prius.

00:00:03.170 --> 00:00:04.540
Let’s lead the way.

00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.070
Are hybrid cars really such a new thing?

00:00:07.070 --> 00:00:08.070
Nope.

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:17.779
They've been around for over 100 years.

00:00:17.779 --> 00:00:22.800
In our fast-moving tech world, automobiles
have come a long way, baby.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:28.990
But they've been working hard for more than
100 years to make the things you see on the

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:29.990
road today.

00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:33.820
In 1834, Michael Faraday came up with the
idea that running electrical current through

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:39.400
a coil could create a magnet -- and that same
year Thomas Davenport, a blacksmith from Vermont,

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.010
used primitive batteries to create the first
electric motor.

00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:48.030
By the 1850s, Congress had attempted to build
an all-electric train from DC to Baltimore,

00:00:48.030 --> 00:00:51.480
but the batteries sucked -- sound familiar?

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:54.960
By the 1880s, electric motors, power lines,
and batteries allowed for electric trams and

00:00:54.960 --> 00:00:59.930
trolleys in England and in 1897 electric cars
were first used for commercial taxis in New

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:00.930
York City!

00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:05.940
That being said, by 1900, only 38-percent
of all US automobiles were electrical.

00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:10.960
Steam and combustion engines were very popular,
but it wasn't because electrical engines weren't

00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.250
good, the Baker Motor Company created a electric
car that went 120 (miles per hour?), but those

00:01:16.250 --> 00:01:17.250
batteries doe.

00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:18.670
I assume you see where this is going.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:25.220
In 1900 the first hybrid was created to get
the best of battery and gas together!

00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:31.420
It was called the 'Semper Vivus' (Always Alive)
and was invented by an Austrian named Ferdinand

00:01:31.420 --> 00:01:36.180
Porsche; it could run using the gas, the batteries
or both, was four wheel drive -- for the first

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:39.270
time -- had four wheel brakes -- also, the
first time.

00:01:39.270 --> 00:01:44.720
But, thanks to low gasoline prices, stock
crashes, cheap gas, and two wars, the hybrid

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.420
car fell by the wayside.

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:51.190
That all changed in the 1970s when the gas
crisis hit… people got wise.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:53.880
By the 90s, hybrids started appearing in dealerships.

00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:57.780
The first Toyota Prius, for instance, was
introduced in Japan in 1997.

00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.920
The benefit of the hybrid has to do with the
problems with inertia.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:05.960
As you might remember from Bill Nye, inertia
is a property of matter, whereby an object

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:10.099
in motion tends to stay in motion and an object
at rest tends to stay at rest.

00:02:10.099 --> 00:02:13.090
Overcoming inertia is not awesome for gas
engines.

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.170
When a car begins moving, a gas engine has
to work very hard to overcome that inertia.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.930
Gasoline motors being what they are, this
is super inefficient.

00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:23.260
But for highway driving, gas is great.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:27.819
A full gasoline engine can create a max of
about 100 kilowatts of power, but only needs

00:02:27.819 --> 00:02:30.599
around 7.5 during highway driving.

00:02:30.599 --> 00:02:32.980
This means the engine efficiency is low.

00:02:32.980 --> 00:02:38.030
Hybrids usually have smaller engines, augmented
by electricity.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:42.109
In a hybrid, the engine is one quarter the
size (or less) but still has a good amount

00:02:42.109 --> 00:02:43.280
of power overall.

00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.590
This is good because electric motors are crappy
at sustained driving, but good at bursts of

00:02:47.590 --> 00:02:48.590
speed.

00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.749
During sustained driving an electric motor
is working hard ALL THE TIME.

00:02:52.749 --> 00:02:57.620
Thus, on a highway or country road, they would
use massive amounts of energy to keep the

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.540
wheels moving, so instead a smaller gas engine
takes over.

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:05.889
Electric motors can handle the frequent stops
and starts with less energy.

00:03:05.889 --> 00:03:07.689
Combined together, efficiency wins!

00:03:07.689 --> 00:03:12.370
Even in the early 1900s Porsche knew this,
allowing drivers to choose to turn off the

00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:17.950
combustion motors in the Semper Vivus and
use only the electrics, or could use both.

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:22.059
Today, we're seeing more and more efficient
batteries, smaller, more efficient engines

00:03:22.059 --> 00:03:25.709
and more hybrids and PLUG-IN hybrids, which
use even LESS gasoline.

00:03:25.709 --> 00:03:30.189
Most modern hybrids also capture a lot of
energy, taking the kinetic energy of braking,

00:03:30.189 --> 00:03:34.150
coasting or going downhill and converting
that back into electrical energy.

00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.769
But the question remains, are they REALLY
more efficient?

00:03:37.769 --> 00:03:41.859
Well, when you take into account ALL the carbon
footprint of battery making, shipping, driving,

00:03:41.859 --> 00:03:45.829
burning fossil fuels and so on -- Yes.

00:03:45.829 --> 00:03:50.579
Electrical cars pollute about 1/10 as much
as an all-gas car, hybrids about 1/8 as much.

00:03:50.579 --> 00:03:54.629
If I asked in 1998 if a regular dude would
buy a hybrid car, I'd have been laughed out

00:03:54.629 --> 00:04:01.230
of the room.

00:04:01.230 --> 00:04:03.529
That's for hippies!

00:04:03.529 --> 00:04:04.760
But now?

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.470
What do you think?
