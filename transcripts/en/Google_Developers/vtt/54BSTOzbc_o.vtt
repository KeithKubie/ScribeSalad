MANISH BHARGAVA: Hi everybody.

00:00:01.720 --> 00:00:02.880
I'm Manish Bhargava.

00:00:02.880 --> 00:00:04.820
I'm Product Manager for
Internationalization and

00:00:04.820 --> 00:00:06.940
Localization Efforts
at Google.

00:00:06.940 --> 00:00:08.600
Today we are going to talk
about developing

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:10.270
for a global audience.

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:12.980
Before we do that, let me try to
understand this audience a

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.030
little bit more.

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.500
How many of you speak more
than one language?

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:18.190
Good.

00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:20.350
Nearly 100%.

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:23.000
How many of you here are
Android developers?

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.340
OK.

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:31.250
How many of you are Google+,
Chrome web developers?

00:00:31.250 --> 00:00:33.440
Nearly 60-40.

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:34.210
OK.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:38.340
I'll make sure I touch
upon both areas.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:42.730
How many of you have your app
or product localized in more

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.920
than one language?

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:47.270
Keep your hands raised
if it is in

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:48.520
more than five languages.

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.790
More than 10 languages.

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:58.540
OK, 15 languages.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:01.520
20.

00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:03.366
One, two, three, four.

00:01:03.366 --> 00:01:06.310
30 languages.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:07.190
Nobody.

00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.360
Oh, there is one.

00:01:09.360 --> 00:01:10.610
Why don't you--

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:16.190
you are definitely ahead
of the curve already.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:17.860
Why don't I give you
an Android--

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.110
[INAUDIBLE].

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:28.860
Perfect.

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:30.110
OK.

00:01:38.132 --> 00:01:38.630
OK.

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.030
So that's good.

00:01:40.030 --> 00:01:42.910
I saw a number of you raise your
hands in terms of more

00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:44.780
than 10 languages.

00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.130
So let me give an overview.

00:01:48.130 --> 00:01:51.800
So first we'll touch upon
why it makes sense to go

00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:54.160
international.

00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:57.540
We'll discuss the steps that you
need to go global and to

00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.780
make really an awesome app
for worldwide users.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.300
And then I will talk about some
strategy considerations,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.655
some resources, and practical
tips that we at Google, over

00:02:08.655 --> 00:02:10.039
time, have collected.

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:14.130
And that should help you in
overcoming the common pitfalls

00:02:14.130 --> 00:02:18.540
so that you can essentially, as
you go in your effort to go

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:19.790
international.

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:26.710
So first question is why
go international?

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:28.090
I have users.

00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:29.360
I have revenue.

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.580
What am I missing?

00:02:32.580 --> 00:02:34.980
So here is a pie chart
which shows

00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:37.070
internet users by region.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:39.460
So clearly if you are developing
for just one

00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:42.570
region, and it could be any of
the regions there, you are

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.570
getting only a piece
of the pie.

00:02:44.570 --> 00:02:48.140
In particular, if you are
developing for North America,

00:02:48.140 --> 00:02:51.670
you are only getting 11.4%
of internet users.

00:02:51.670 --> 00:02:54.370
Let's look at it from
another perspective.

00:02:54.370 --> 00:02:56.200
Internet users by language.

00:02:56.200 --> 00:03:00.140
Again, a similar pie chart,
this time by language.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:01.540
And it's the same story.

00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:05.620
If you are just developing for a
particular language, you are

00:03:05.620 --> 00:03:09.010
getting only a piece
of the pie.

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.910
Specifically, if you are
developing just for English,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.120
you are getting about 1/4
of internet users.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:16.960
But more importantly, you
are missing out on

00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:21.580
75% of internet users.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:23.030
That's from the user side.

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:25.450
What about the revenue side?

00:03:25.450 --> 00:03:29.810
Here, I'm showing you the
revenue trend of a number of

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:33.880
companies, Facebook, Zynga,
Google, VMware.

00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:35.700
And you will see a
common thread.

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:39.980
The red portion, which is the
international revenue as

00:03:39.980 --> 00:03:44.540
percentage of revenue, is
increasing year over year.

00:03:44.540 --> 00:03:48.090
So whether you are driven by a
number of internet users or

00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:51.330
the users for your app, your
product, or if you are driven

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:54.020
by revenue, going

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.420
international helps your cause.

00:03:56.420 --> 00:03:58.980
So, again, many of you mentioned
you are Android

00:03:58.980 --> 00:03:59.560
developers.

00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:01.770
So let me go a little bit
deeper into the Android

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:03.050
opportunity.

00:04:03.050 --> 00:04:06.360
So as you heard yesterday
in the keynote speech,

00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:06.660
[? Sunter ?]

00:04:06.660 --> 00:04:10.490
mentioned that Android ecosystem
is growing at a

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:11.610
really good pace.

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:14.720
900 million Android
activations.

00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.250
48 billion app installs.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:20.160
And, again, the numbers are
growing and especially from an

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:21.570
emerging market perspective.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:22.890
And we'll talk about that.

00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.710
If you look at it from a Play
Revenue perspective as well,

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.980
look at how the US revenue has
pretty much remained constant

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:33.660
from a graph while other
countries, more specifically

00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.560
Korea and Japan, have grown
significantly over time.

00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.480
So if you are only developing
for English, you are missing

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:43.380
out on this huge revenue uptake
which is possible if

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.720
you are developing for these
other languages.

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:52.180
So here is a table which shows
the internet growth and

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:53.630
penetration numbers.

00:04:53.630 --> 00:04:55.710
This is taken from Mary
Meeker's 2012

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:57.430
internet trends talk.

00:04:57.430 --> 00:05:00.610
I would like you to focus
on two columns.

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.890
One is the year over
year growth.

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.920
And notice some of the
emerging markets.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:07.620
The numbers are in solid
double digits.

00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:09.080
India, 26%.

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.550
Indonesia, 58%.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:14.790
Look at US, 3%.

00:05:14.790 --> 00:05:17.020
Let's also look at the last
column, which is the

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:18.420
population penetration.

00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.510
This is number of internet users
as percentage of total

00:05:22.510 --> 00:05:23.680
population.

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.450
India, 11%.

00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.180
Indonesia, 23%.

00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:31.030
US, 78%.

00:05:31.030 --> 00:05:35.430
So the message here is the
growth of internet users as it

00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.970
is today is really in
emerging markets.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:40.690
And what is more striking
is there is

00:05:40.690 --> 00:05:42.790
room for growth there.

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:45.280
And, again, it's huge
in terms of--

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.600
look at the, basically, early
teens or late teens for most

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.950
of the emerging markets in
terms of the population

00:05:50.950 --> 00:05:53.530
penetration, while it is more
or less saturated in some of

00:05:53.530 --> 00:05:57.490
the developed markets.

00:05:57.490 --> 00:06:01.180
Another point which I want to
touch upon in terms of why

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:03.450
internationalization makes
sense is, this is the

00:06:03.450 --> 00:06:07.420
enterprise percentage change
in advertising spend.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:09.920
Notice Europe is negative .4%.

00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:11.850
US is 1.8%.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:17.250
But the real growth is, again,
coming from Asia, Middle East,

00:06:17.250 --> 00:06:18.520
Latin America.

00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:20.570
So, again, if you're not
developing for these markets,

00:06:20.570 --> 00:06:24.300
you are missing out in terms of
both from a revenue, as we

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:26.155
saw here, but also from
a user's perspective.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.160
So I hope I have given you
enough evidence to show why it

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:34.700
makes sense.

00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:37.760
And in today's world, developing
for global audience

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:38.860
is not a luxury.

00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:40.810
But it's really necessary.

00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:44.830
And it's a huge potential
opportunity there as well.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:47.860
So the next question is
I understand that.

00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:53.780
What do I need to do for
my app to go globally?

00:06:53.780 --> 00:06:57.350
So one thing which I'll clear
from the very beginning is

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:01.040
developing for global audience
is not just getting your app

00:07:01.040 --> 00:07:01.600
translation.

00:07:01.600 --> 00:07:04.230
So it's much more than
translation.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.240
You can think of going global
as a two step process.

00:07:08.240 --> 00:07:10.530
First, internationalization.

00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:12.280
And second, localization.

00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:15.820
So internationalization,
i18n, i followed by 18

00:07:15.820 --> 00:07:16.910
characters and n.

00:07:16.910 --> 00:07:19.820
And localization, l10n,
l followed by 10

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:21.750
characters and n.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.270
What is internationalization?

00:07:23.270 --> 00:07:27.230
Internationalization is
designing and coding to enable

00:07:27.230 --> 00:07:32.360
support for languages, region,
and cultural differences.

00:07:32.360 --> 00:07:35.510
It includes things like
externalizing localizable

00:07:35.510 --> 00:07:39.630
resources, presenting dates,
time, number format in a

00:07:39.630 --> 00:07:43.970
locale relevant form, processing
user input, sorting

00:07:43.970 --> 00:07:47.830
data, and supporting characters
in all languages,

00:07:47.830 --> 00:07:53.420
be it double wide character in
Eastern Asian languages or

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:57.670
bi-directional display for
Middle Eastern Languages or

00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:01.250
supporting diacritics for
Central European languages.

00:08:01.250 --> 00:08:05.450
In terms of localization, it's
adapting the look and feel of

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:08.390
your product, of your
app, for language,

00:08:08.390 --> 00:08:09.800
regions, and culture.

00:08:09.800 --> 00:08:16.310
It includes translation, local
defaults, and custom features.

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:20.970
So the question is getting it
right, does it really matter?

00:08:20.970 --> 00:08:25.240
So in some cases, it's
embarrassing blooper.

00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.620
So for example, I'll show
an example here.

00:08:27.620 --> 00:08:31.660
This is Google Sites, the
English version, where the

00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:36.270
font size was S,M,L for small,
medium, and large.

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:37.880
Anyone here can read Arabic?

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:41.360
No.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:41.750
OK.

00:08:41.750 --> 00:08:43.669
So I'll try.

00:08:43.669 --> 00:08:45.970
When it got translated,
it became

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:50.590
Saturday, Monday, lunch.

00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:56.240
And part of it is, again, did
it really impact in terms of

00:08:56.240 --> 00:08:57.140
site usage?

00:08:57.140 --> 00:08:57.600
Not really.

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:01.900
But it's an embarrassing
situation where, if not done

00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:06.330
right, it impacts in
meaningful ways.

00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:08.860
But in some cases, it
is more important.

00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.120
It affects your bottom line.

00:09:11.120 --> 00:09:13.150
So here is another example.

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.290
This is Google Maps in Sweden.

00:09:15.290 --> 00:09:18.380
On the right hand side, you
see the English version.

00:09:18.380 --> 00:09:22.400
On the left hand side, you
see the Swedish version.

00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:26.150
So after we launched directions,
get driving

00:09:26.150 --> 00:09:32.270
directions, walking directions
globally, we saw that usage

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:36.390
for driving directions, walking
directions, was very

00:09:36.390 --> 00:09:40.370
low in Sweden compared to its
neighbors and compared to

00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:42.030
global as well.

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:44.340
We didn't know the
reason for that.

00:09:44.340 --> 00:09:47.910
We looked at logs and said,
let's look at those and see

00:09:47.910 --> 00:09:49.780
what might be going wrong.

00:09:49.780 --> 00:09:51.030
We couldn't find anything.

00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.670
We hired a local consulting firm
and said, help us figure

00:09:54.670 --> 00:09:57.380
out way we're not getting
the usage.

00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.890
And, again, we didn't
make much progress.

00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:03.230
Anyone knows Swedish here?

00:10:03.230 --> 00:10:05.670
Can you tell what that
word would mean?

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.250
Pretty close, yeah.

00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:15.380
Its verbal translation is
actually instructions.

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.590
So, again, without context,
get directions and

00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.150
instructions, would pretty much
be OK from a translation

00:10:22.150 --> 00:10:23.040
perspective.

00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.270
But you would not expect
somebody who's looking for

00:10:25.270 --> 00:10:28.140
driving directions to click on
instructions to get driving

00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:28.960
directions.

00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.060
So when we corrected that,
changed that to really mean

00:10:32.060 --> 00:10:35.410
get directions, as in driving
directions, the usage went up

00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:39.800
and was at par with neighboring
countries as well

00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:41.050
as from a global perspective.

00:10:44.150 --> 00:10:49.630
So just one more point on that
front is getting it right

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.860
matters in terms of when I say
it means localization,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.060
internationalization because
it is important for a local

00:10:56.060 --> 00:11:00.040
user to feel that the product
that they have has been

00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:00.990
developed for them.

00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:04.740
It's been designed for them,
rather than feeling like it's

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:09.190
a US or an English only version
shipped to them with

00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:12.490
some cosmetic changes.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:17.260
So we talked about that it's a
two step process, i18n and

00:11:17.260 --> 00:11:19.140
l10n, so internationalization
and localization.

00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:21.540
So let's go a little deeper
into internationalization.

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:24.330
So first is the i18n
design principle.

00:11:24.330 --> 00:11:26.490
Essentially, designing your
product to be language and

00:11:26.490 --> 00:11:29.230
region independent is an
important consideration.

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:32.700
So I'll give you some examples
where i18 and design, when

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.050
done right from very beginning,
can help you be

00:11:36.050 --> 00:11:38.880
successful in your international
efforts.

00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.570
So here is an example.

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:46.100
It would be from Google+ where
it could be John Smith added

00:11:46.100 --> 00:11:48.940
five person to his circles.

00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.110
This is, again, a UI text.

00:11:51.110 --> 00:11:54.490
What might be wrong when we take
this in other languages?

00:11:54.490 --> 00:11:57.670
What might go wrong
in some of this?

00:11:57.670 --> 00:11:59.750
Yes.

00:11:59.750 --> 00:12:01.680
Good point.

00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.310
Any other--

00:12:03.310 --> 00:12:04.560
yes?

00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.055
Good.

00:12:08.055 --> 00:12:08.330
Yeah.

00:12:08.330 --> 00:12:10.900
So the hard coded aspects.

00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.150
Yes.

00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:16.660
That makes sense too.

00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:18.060
Yes, speak loudly.

00:12:25.870 --> 00:12:26.560
Good.

00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:28.870
very good point.

00:12:28.870 --> 00:12:32.720
So pretty much all of you were
pretty close and right in all

00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:33.700
of those respects.

00:12:33.700 --> 00:12:35.320
So first is concatenation.

00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.510
So, again, we are concatenating
strings here,

00:12:37.510 --> 00:12:40.490
which pretty much always is
a problem because when

00:12:40.490 --> 00:12:42.720
translator gets this and they
need to translate in certain

00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:46.300
language, they need to change
the order of these place

00:12:46.300 --> 00:12:48.980
holders and then it would
be difficult to do that.

00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:51.370
Second is the plural and
gender agreement.

00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:55.130
And again, as it was mentioned
earlier, in terms of what

00:12:55.130 --> 00:12:57.890
happens if that number
is more than one.

00:12:57.890 --> 00:13:00.387
In English, you could
essentially do person to

00:13:00.387 --> 00:13:02.260
persons and that
would solve it.

00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:05.060
But think of languages like
Arabic which has six different

00:13:05.060 --> 00:13:05.960
plural forms.

00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:08.540
So how do you handle that
in meaningful ways?

00:13:08.540 --> 00:13:10.820
And, again, from a gender
agreement perspective, the

00:13:10.820 --> 00:13:13.840
name could be female,
could be male.

00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:15.240
How do you handle that?

00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.640
And then, as was mentioned here,
sometimes these would be

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.490
hard coded strings, so
non-externalized strings

00:13:21.490 --> 00:13:25.080
which, again, is a problem
from a different language

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:25.980
perspective.

00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:27.470
So how do you solve these?

00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.340
Well, one way is you
do your research.

00:13:30.340 --> 00:13:31.410
Go on internet.

00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:34.540
Look on Google, all the
different plural formats in

00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:35.400
different languages.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:38.450
And go ahead and create
an algorithm for that.

00:13:38.450 --> 00:13:40.580
Rather just use a library.

00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:43.640
So, again, there is
open source ICU.

00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:46.000
And I'll talk a little bit
more details about the

00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:47.800
International Conference
for Unicode.

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:50.370
And you could use the plural and
gender library available

00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:53.010
there for solving this, where
you don't need to worry about

00:13:53.010 --> 00:13:54.410
what happens in different
languages.

00:13:54.410 --> 00:13:55.660
That will take care of that.

00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:02.170
How many of you here are back
end engineers, people who

00:14:02.170 --> 00:14:04.370
don't deal with UI strings?

00:14:04.370 --> 00:14:07.100
Well, you must be thinking
when we saw the UI text

00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:09.240
example, well, I don't have to
worry about the messy string.

00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:11.700
So I can just zone off,
and I'll be fine.

00:14:11.700 --> 00:14:15.200
This example is just for you.

00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.340
Again, this is an old example.

00:14:16.340 --> 00:14:18.450
But we learned a
lot from this.

00:14:18.450 --> 00:14:21.410
This is a conceptual view of
Google video, where a user

00:14:21.410 --> 00:14:23.260
comes in, uploads their video.

00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:24.760
It gets stored in the servers.

00:14:24.760 --> 00:14:25.820
It gets indexed.

00:14:25.820 --> 00:14:29.200
And then the serving server
would essentially, users would

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:33.930
search for them and then will
find the right videos.

00:14:33.930 --> 00:14:41.320
What we saw is whenever the name
of the video had strings,

00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.950
which used Unicode, so non ASCII
strings, users couldn't

00:14:45.950 --> 00:14:47.810
find those videos.

00:14:47.810 --> 00:14:49.150
What could have gone wrong?

00:14:49.150 --> 00:14:50.620
Or where things could
have gone wrong?

00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.110
Will do.

00:14:59.110 --> 00:15:01.090
OK.

00:15:01.090 --> 00:15:05.250
So anyone, if you want to just
come into aisle and talk about

00:15:05.250 --> 00:15:10.120
what might be wrong or where
things might be wrong.

00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.370
Come to the aisle.

00:15:17.290 --> 00:15:19.520
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
in the database?

00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.120
MANISH BHARGAVA: Good
point, yes.

00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.240
So that's one example where
the database and the

00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:26.540
persistence and the backup
might be an issue.

00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.180
Actually, it was all
of the above.

00:15:30.180 --> 00:15:33.030
Every place where it could
potentially fail, failed.

00:15:33.030 --> 00:15:35.630
And, again, there are
the details there.

00:15:35.630 --> 00:15:38.990
The message here is i18n
impacts the back end.

00:15:38.990 --> 00:15:44.280
And there were some design
decisions that were made which

00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:45.780
had English assumptions.

00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:47.680
So I'll give you one
specific example.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:54.350
Notice how the last part where
upload, it required that the

00:15:54.350 --> 00:15:57.430
name of the video should at
least be three characters.

00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.410
The reasonable assumption in
English, you won't expect the

00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.590
name of the videos to be
A or something similar.

00:16:04.590 --> 00:16:09.210
But what happens when you
have names which are

00:16:09.210 --> 00:16:11.120
in different languages?

00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:14.140
So the character which is
shown there, I'll try to

00:16:14.140 --> 00:16:16.680
pronounce it, [? kal ?]

00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.910
is one character which
means dog in Chinese.

00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:24.800
And it's a very common
name of video in

00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.160
terms of dog as a name.

00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:29.020
So clearly that assumption
made it

00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:31.490
unusable for Chinese language.

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:34.650
So, again, from a perspective
of if you get that from a

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:39.100
design perspective, if you make
right decisions, keeping

00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:41.180
into account
internationalization, you

00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:43.440
would be able to handle many
of these situations right.

00:16:43.440 --> 00:16:46.530
And, again, I'm happy to talk in
details about any of those

00:16:46.530 --> 00:16:48.090
after the talk if you
have questions.

00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:52.760
So here's another example.

00:16:52.760 --> 00:16:58.590
This list, names of cities,
and it's arranged in

00:16:58.590 --> 00:16:59.760
alphabetical order.

00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:01.580
In English, pretty
straightforward.

00:17:01.580 --> 00:17:08.030
A, C, C, H, Z. Makes sense,
alphabetical order.

00:17:08.030 --> 00:17:14.329
In Slovak, the Ch sound is
actually a separate character.

00:17:14.329 --> 00:17:17.280
It's a separate letter, which
goes between H and I. So in

00:17:17.280 --> 00:17:20.050
that case, the ordering becomes
a little different.

00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:23.589
In Danish, the A with the ring
above it is actually a

00:17:23.589 --> 00:17:24.960
different letter.

00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.600
And, again, it denotes a long
letter and a darker A. And it

00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:33.180
actually comes after A. So in
Danish, the alphabetical order

00:17:33.180 --> 00:17:34.240
would be that.

00:17:34.240 --> 00:17:37.270
So, again, going back to the
principal do you need to know?

00:17:37.270 --> 00:17:40.430
If you use, let's say, the
ASCII sorting or Unicode

00:17:40.430 --> 00:17:44.070
sorting, you would get it wrong,
again, because each of

00:17:44.070 --> 00:17:46.310
the language has different
nuances in terms of how the

00:17:46.310 --> 00:17:47.610
sorting is done.

00:17:47.610 --> 00:17:50.640
And we are just looking at Latin
character languages.

00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.800
What happens if they are non
Latin script languages,

00:17:53.800 --> 00:17:56.290
Chinese and so on?

00:17:56.290 --> 00:17:59.850
So, again, from a perspective
of how do you get it right,

00:17:59.850 --> 00:18:02.510
one, you could essentially look
at it and see how the

00:18:02.510 --> 00:18:04.430
sorting looks in different
languages and know about all

00:18:04.430 --> 00:18:06.090
these different characters.

00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:07.690
Or you could use the library.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:10.750
And, again, in ICU there is a
library which does the sorting

00:18:10.750 --> 00:18:12.000
right for you.

00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:21.840
So I gave you three examples
where if you get the i18n

00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:25.740
designs right from the very
beginning, it is useful to be

00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.320
successful from an
internationalization

00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.310
perspective.

00:18:28.310 --> 00:18:31.290
Now let's look at how all of
this comes together, how you

00:18:31.290 --> 00:18:35.340
will design your system, your
architecture so that it is

00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:37.030
right from the very beginning.

00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:45.470
So first aspect is if you wanted
to develop code that

00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:51.320
works across different countries
and is effective,

00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:55.780
make sure your common code base
is language and region

00:18:55.780 --> 00:18:56.710
independent.

00:18:56.710 --> 00:19:00.350
It is all Unicode and that's
where all your core, core

00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.850
language independent
aspects go in.

00:19:02.850 --> 00:19:06.290
Anything which is dependent on
language or location would

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:08.300
essentially be handled through
the libraries.

00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:10.410
We looked at some of the
trickier examples earlier.

00:19:10.410 --> 00:19:13.720
But date formatting would be
another example where you

00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:16.400
would handle them through
the right libraries.

00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:20.650
And then there is the aspect of
localization, externalizing

00:19:20.650 --> 00:19:23.640
your resources, that those
could be strings.

00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:25.640
Those could be images.

00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:28.930
So for example, hello world
string extracted and then

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.200
translated, localized
into as many

00:19:31.200 --> 00:19:33.496
languages that you're targeting.

00:19:33.496 --> 00:19:35.930
And having those then
externalize and then once you

00:19:35.930 --> 00:19:38.540
get them back, [? serving ?]
for the right locale.

00:19:38.540 --> 00:19:42.570
That, overall, is the full
picture in terms of the i18n

00:19:42.570 --> 00:19:45.920
summary for you in terms of
getting the architecture right

00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:48.570
from an internationalization
perspective.

00:19:48.570 --> 00:19:51.330
So let me introduce another
concept, the

00:19:51.330 --> 00:19:53.050
right to left layout.

00:19:53.050 --> 00:19:57.170
So, here, what you're looking
at is a right to left layout

00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:58.420
in English.

00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:03.690
Would you use this if you were
to ask to use this on

00:20:03.690 --> 00:20:05.040
a day to day basis?

00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:07.770
Well, you probably would be OK
using it once in awhile.

00:20:07.770 --> 00:20:10.070
But what if there are no
alternatives, if this is the

00:20:10.070 --> 00:20:13.980
interface that you are to
use day in and day out?

00:20:13.980 --> 00:20:16.240
You wouldn't feel really
great about it.

00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:18.710
The same is the feeling for the
people who use right to

00:20:18.710 --> 00:20:21.170
left languages.

00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:25.720
So those would be Arabic,
Hebrew, Persian, Urdu, when

00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.410
they have to use the left
to right interface.

00:20:28.410 --> 00:20:29.580
These languages are also called

00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:31.060
bi-directional languages.

00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:32.590
Why bi-directional?

00:20:32.590 --> 00:20:40.140
Because the text goes left to
right, but the numbers go--

00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:44.450
the strings go right to left,
numbers go left to right.

00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:49.700
So here, bi-directional layout
done right or the RTL layout

00:20:49.700 --> 00:20:51.060
done right.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:54.130
What you are typically used to
seeing in Gmail on the left,

00:20:54.130 --> 00:20:55.980
they are on the right
hand side.

00:20:55.980 --> 00:20:59.240
And unlike some of the examples
that we covered

00:20:59.240 --> 00:21:02.280
earlier, here, it is
not as simple as

00:21:02.280 --> 00:21:04.060
just using a library.

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:08.150
For getting your RTL layout
right, you need to spend some

00:21:08.150 --> 00:21:09.380
engineering effort.

00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:12.360
Think about that from a design
perspective and putting

00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:15.030
engineering efforts to get it
right and from some testing

00:21:15.030 --> 00:21:16.280
perspective as well.

00:21:18.450 --> 00:21:22.760
So we talked about some
resources which are available.

00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:26.520
Again, from getting the RTL
layout right, you need to have

00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:33.380
some resources beyond just
getting the libraries.

00:21:33.380 --> 00:21:35.550
And, again, I'll talk about some
of the resources there.

00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:38.550
So why don't we look at some
of the resources that are

00:21:38.550 --> 00:21:42.450
available to you in terms
of helping you with your

00:21:42.450 --> 00:21:44.170
internationalization efforts?

00:21:44.170 --> 00:21:47.550
So the URL to go to is
developers.googl

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:51.620
e.com/international.

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.870
And these resources--

00:21:52.870 --> 00:21:55.935
and, again, I'll show you some
of the ones listed here.

00:22:00.690 --> 00:22:06.110
What's good about these
resources is that these are

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:08.390
resources that either we have
developed or that we are

00:22:08.390 --> 00:22:09.725
actively contributing to.

00:22:27.150 --> 00:22:31.260
So anyways, for some reason
I can't display that.

00:22:31.260 --> 00:22:34.340
But I'll just continue talking
based on that.

00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.045
Developers.googl
e.com/international.

00:22:37.045 --> 00:22:40.260
That's where you'll see listing
of about 18 resources,

00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:42.400
tools that are available
to you.

00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.310
Some of them, I will talk in
detail in the resource section

00:22:46.310 --> 00:22:47.360
of the talk.

00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.870
But I want to highlight a few.

00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:52.770
So if you are using Closure or
if you're using GWT, Google

00:22:52.770 --> 00:22:56.560
Web Toolkit, there are i18n
libraries that can help you

00:22:56.560 --> 00:22:59.830
with internationalization
in those cases.

00:22:59.830 --> 00:23:04.310
Similarly, as we talked about
bidirectional, and you need

00:23:04.310 --> 00:23:08.055
much beyond support than just
using the libraries, there are

00:23:08.055 --> 00:23:12.010
a number of tools available
here, the CSS mirroring tool,

00:23:12.010 --> 00:23:12.430
[INAUDIBLE]

00:23:12.430 --> 00:23:13.840
tool.

00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:15.770
And, again, you can leverage
some of those.

00:23:15.770 --> 00:23:18.280
One tool that I want to
emphasize is the pseudo

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.430
localization.

00:23:19.430 --> 00:23:23.810
So that's essentially the tool
which allows you to mimic what

00:23:23.810 --> 00:23:26.340
happens in the actual
translation in terms of text

00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:30.430
expansion and adding diacritics,
so you would be

00:23:30.430 --> 00:23:34.390
able to see much before actual
localization happens.

00:23:34.390 --> 00:23:38.570
How will your UI look like or
UI layout look like when you

00:23:38.570 --> 00:23:40.737
translate into, let's say,
German, where typical text

00:23:40.737 --> 00:23:42.790
expansion is 30%?

00:23:42.790 --> 00:23:46.200
Or you could use fake BiDi,
which will help you to see how

00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.990
your BiDi layout
will look like.

00:23:47.990 --> 00:23:52.190
The advantage of doing that in
the design and the coding and

00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:54.880
the testing time is that
you save a lot of time.

00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.470
Instead of having to wait until
actual translations come

00:23:57.470 --> 00:24:01.590
in, you could essentially use
those at the design and the

00:24:01.590 --> 00:24:04.290
testing phase itself.

00:24:04.290 --> 00:24:07.230
So we looked at the step one,
which is internationalization,

00:24:07.230 --> 00:24:08.950
making sure your code
base is ready.

00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:11.800
The second step is localization,
adapting the

00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:15.890
look and feel of your product
for the languages, regions,

00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:17.220
and countries.

00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:19.160
So what are the key
considerations that you need

00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:22.300
to look at for preparing
for localization?

00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:26.430
The first is determining your
target language set.

00:24:26.430 --> 00:24:29.670
It seems like an easy task but
requires a little bit of

00:24:29.670 --> 00:24:31.630
attention in meaningful ways.

00:24:31.630 --> 00:24:35.230
So if you are driven by getting
more users, you might

00:24:35.230 --> 00:24:37.840
say, well, I want to go in where
there are most users.

00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.560
So look at internet users
and just go by that.

00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:42.290
You might say, well, I'm
driven by revenue.

00:24:42.290 --> 00:24:45.680
And then in that case, whichever
are the top revenue

00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:47.970
generating countries, you
might target those.

00:24:47.970 --> 00:24:51.690
Or you might say, well, I will
go in markets where my

00:24:51.690 --> 00:24:54.190
competition has already gone in
so they are clearly users

00:24:54.190 --> 00:24:56.190
and I would also like
to target them.

00:24:56.190 --> 00:24:58.630
Or you might say, well, I would
like to go to those

00:24:58.630 --> 00:25:02.010
markets where there are no
competitors so that you get

00:25:02.010 --> 00:25:03.600
the first mover advantage.

00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:06.080
So, again, there are different
strategies that you can use to

00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.900
decide what are your target
languages, target countries,

00:25:08.900 --> 00:25:10.690
target locations.

00:25:10.690 --> 00:25:12.840
But that requires a little
bit of thought

00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.710
initially as you do that.

00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:18.050
The second is make sure your
localizable resources are

00:25:18.050 --> 00:25:19.270
separate from your
source codes.

00:25:19.270 --> 00:25:22.180
So they are in resource bundles
or extracted so that

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:24.430
they could be sent for
translation easily.

00:25:24.430 --> 00:25:26.980
And then third is finding
a localization vendor.

00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:31.160
In some cases you have one-stop
shops available, or

00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:35.260
you could essentially use
vendors that specialize in

00:25:35.260 --> 00:25:38.630
certain language pairs or
vendors who do multiple

00:25:38.630 --> 00:25:39.870
language pairs.

00:25:39.870 --> 00:25:42.590
Important aspect is the tool
that they use or you are

00:25:42.590 --> 00:25:51.010
using, make sure it has usage
for tools, glossary, the

00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:55.780
translation memory and
similar stuff.

00:25:55.780 --> 00:25:58.250
Let's look at a case study.

00:25:58.250 --> 00:26:03.420
Autodesk and Autocad WS is an
app available in Google Play,

00:26:03.420 --> 00:26:05.400
available in iOS.

00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.990
So this was published
in March, 2013.

00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:11.310
And it talks about how they
tripled their users by getting

00:26:11.310 --> 00:26:12.960
the localization right.

00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:13.860
So there are two aspects.

00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:14.740
Triple their users.

00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:19.360
So their download rate went up
from 1,500 per day to about

00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:22.210
5,000 per day within
six months.

00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.030
They now have about
10 million users.

00:26:24.030 --> 00:26:27.530
8.5 million of them do
not speak English

00:26:27.530 --> 00:26:29.600
as their first language.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:32.590
So among other things that this
case study talks about,

00:26:32.590 --> 00:26:36.390
one important aspect they stress
is making sure your

00:26:36.390 --> 00:26:40.840
product listing page is
localized properly.

00:26:40.840 --> 00:26:42.270
What does that mean?

00:26:42.270 --> 00:26:44.260
Making sure that it is
not just translated.

00:26:44.260 --> 00:26:46.060
It is localized, made
relevant for the

00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.600
market that you're targeting.

00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.290
So a few special examples are,
let's say app screen shots.

00:26:51.290 --> 00:26:54.510
So most of the time your app
screen shots have user names.

00:26:54.510 --> 00:26:56.230
So John Smith.

00:26:56.230 --> 00:27:01.040
But for localization purposes,
John Smith becomes Mario or

00:27:01.040 --> 00:27:03.590
Carlos if you are going
in Spanish.

00:27:03.590 --> 00:27:07.730
Or it becomes [? Dahl, ?]

00:27:07.730 --> 00:27:10.300
for if you are going
in Chinese.

00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:15.390
Similarly units, from inches
and feet it becomes meters.

00:27:15.390 --> 00:27:17.240
From pound it become kilos--

00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:20.940
so paying attention to the right
units that are prevalent

00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:22.260
in that market.

00:27:22.260 --> 00:27:24.990
If you have images, making sure
those images reflect the

00:27:24.990 --> 00:27:28.040
actual experience
in that locale.

00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:31.570
And, similarly, if you have
maps, a Japanese user would

00:27:31.570 --> 00:27:34.892
relate more to a pinned location
in Tokyo rather than

00:27:34.892 --> 00:27:35.700
in San Francisco.

00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:37.840
So making sure you pay attention
to those minor

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:40.990
details, helps a lot, goes a
long way in terms of making

00:27:40.990 --> 00:27:43.835
sure you get the right usage.

00:27:46.690 --> 00:27:51.620
Up to this point, Android app
localization was difficult in

00:27:51.620 --> 00:27:53.240
terms of there was no
easy way to do it.

00:27:53.240 --> 00:27:54.410
It was a tedious process.

00:27:54.410 --> 00:27:57.240
You actually had to extract
your strings, identify a

00:27:57.240 --> 00:28:00.010
vendor, send to the vendor
outside, get those back, then

00:28:00.010 --> 00:28:02.830
integrate them back, and then
put them back in Google Play.

00:28:02.830 --> 00:28:05.910
What we launched yesterday,
and it's open for sign ups

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:10.745
now, is the ability to get your
app localized from play

00:28:10.745 --> 00:28:12.030
dev console itself.

00:28:12.030 --> 00:28:14.750
So, again, if you go to your dev
console today, you would

00:28:14.750 --> 00:28:17.960
see something like sign up to
try the service where you

00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:20.610
could essentially sign up now
and then, I think next week,

00:28:20.610 --> 00:28:23.950
the apps will be whitelisted
and you can go

00:28:23.950 --> 00:28:25.040
through this process.

00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:26.940
The good part is now
it is streamlined.

00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:29.390
It is right from the
dev console.

00:28:29.390 --> 00:28:31.000
You can choose the
right languages.

00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.490
You can choose the vendors
and do it from there.

00:28:34.490 --> 00:28:37.535
So, again, you can find more
details at developer.google

00:28:37.535 --> 00:28:40.780
.com/international, the
Android section.

00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:43.580
And, again, the URL
is right there.

00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.030
I would encourage
you to try this.

00:28:47.630 --> 00:28:51.350
Let's talk a little bit about
the localization resources.

00:28:51.350 --> 00:28:52.785
Again, the URL.

00:28:52.785 --> 00:28:54.730
Again, if you don't remember
anything from this talk,

00:28:54.730 --> 00:28:57.540
remember developers.googl
e.com/international.

00:28:57.540 --> 00:28:59.410
Right there you will see
the translation tools

00:28:59.410 --> 00:29:00.760
listed there as well.

00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:03.340
So first is Google Translation
Toolkit.

00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:05.940
It's a CAD tool available
for free.

00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.090
You can get your docs, your
strings translated.

00:29:09.090 --> 00:29:11.690
All of Google's localization
is done through Google

00:29:11.690 --> 00:29:14.790
transition tool kit.

00:29:14.790 --> 00:29:18.140
If you have YouTube videos and
you would like to get to the

00:29:18.140 --> 00:29:20.230
captions translated,
again, that's the

00:29:20.230 --> 00:29:22.750
tool for doing that.

00:29:22.750 --> 00:29:24.430
The other tools which are
available is machine

00:29:24.430 --> 00:29:25.140
translation.

00:29:25.140 --> 00:29:27.240
And, again,
translate.google.com.

00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:30.590
It sells millions of
translations every day.

00:29:30.590 --> 00:29:34.720
There was a talk yesterday on
using the translate API for

00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:35.990
going global as well.

00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:37.330
And, again, if you have missed,
you can essentially

00:29:37.330 --> 00:29:39.060
see that on YouTube.

00:29:39.060 --> 00:29:43.560
If you have a website, there is
this website element, which

00:29:43.560 --> 00:29:44.340
you could install.

00:29:44.340 --> 00:29:47.340
It's a JavaScript, three lines
of JavaScript which you put on

00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:48.230
your website.

00:29:48.230 --> 00:29:52.060
And it essentially shows the
your website in the target

00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.030
language based on when
user comes in.

00:29:54.030 --> 00:29:57.970
So essentially it detects the
language and shows the page in

00:29:57.970 --> 00:29:59.390
that language.

00:29:59.390 --> 00:30:01.600
What is cool about this
is there is a

00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:02.850
customized element to it.

00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.310
It is not just machine
translation.

00:30:04.310 --> 00:30:07.880
You could invite a family, you
could invite friends to go in

00:30:07.880 --> 00:30:11.820
there and customize the page,
make changes and those will,

00:30:11.820 --> 00:30:15.520
on the fly, be live as well.

00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:18.160
Similarly, if you are an
advertiser and you want to

00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.160
take your ads localized into
different markets, you could

00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:24.690
essentially go to global
advertiser localization guide

00:30:24.690 --> 00:30:27.440
and you can see more details
there in terms

00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:28.800
of how to do that.

00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:30.900
And we already talked about
getting your apps localized.

00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:36.460
So now let me talk a little bit
about some of the strategy

00:30:36.460 --> 00:30:38.925
considerations, resources,
and practical tips.

00:30:42.080 --> 00:30:45.420
So first important consideration
is when and

00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:46.540
where to launch.

00:30:46.540 --> 00:30:51.030
Where should you go launch
your product, your app?

00:30:51.030 --> 00:30:54.150
Important thing to note is
launching in a language is not

00:30:54.150 --> 00:30:55.670
the same as launching
in a country.

00:30:55.670 --> 00:30:59.900
So, for example, if you're
targeting Spanish, it is

00:30:59.900 --> 00:31:02.590
whether you are targeting
Spanish as in Spain or you're

00:31:02.590 --> 00:31:04.650
targeting Spanish as
in Latin America.

00:31:04.650 --> 00:31:06.950
So es-419, which is the
abstraction for

00:31:06.950 --> 00:31:09.320
all of Latin America.

00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.390
Or you might be targeting
specific countries within

00:31:11.390 --> 00:31:12.100
Latin America.

00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:14.260
So es, as in for Mexico.

00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:17.260
Or you might be targeting
Spanish users in US.

00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:18.690
So es, US.

00:31:18.690 --> 00:31:21.650
And, again, what you are seeing
there, es, es, es-419,

00:31:21.650 --> 00:31:23.480
and all of those, those
are locales.

00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:25.800
So, essentially, it's a
combination of a language and

00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.820
country and that uniquely
defines

00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.220
where you are targeting.

00:31:30.220 --> 00:31:33.890
Then another consideration
here is there are these

00:31:33.890 --> 00:31:36.480
multi-language countries.

00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.740
For example, Canada,
Switzerland, Belgium.

00:31:39.740 --> 00:31:41.880
So let's say if you're targeting
Canada, do you

00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.980
develop in English, your
app for English?

00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:45.170
Do you develop for French?

00:31:45.170 --> 00:31:47.110
Or do you develop for both?

00:31:47.110 --> 00:31:49.150
So, again, those are kind of
considerations that you need

00:31:49.150 --> 00:31:50.580
to look into.

00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:55.330
Another set of considerations
are law and the policy in

00:31:55.330 --> 00:31:56.320
those markets.

00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:58.440
So for example, there are
location based services are

00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.110
tricky in certain countries.

00:32:00.110 --> 00:32:03.400
EU has a high sensitivity
to privacy.

00:32:03.400 --> 00:32:05.030
So you need to take
that into account.

00:32:05.030 --> 00:32:08.880
Thailand has strict
lese majeste laws.

00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.620
So if you have user generated
content, it becomes tricky in

00:32:11.620 --> 00:32:12.420
that respect.

00:32:12.420 --> 00:32:15.100
And, again, there's some
censorship regimes in terms of

00:32:15.100 --> 00:32:17.370
China and Iran, great
firewall of China.

00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.780
So if you're targeting these
markets, how do you handle

00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.530
these scenarios?

00:32:21.530 --> 00:32:27.270
There are some examples of if
you need data to be localized

00:32:27.270 --> 00:32:29.260
in those markets, how
do you provide that

00:32:29.260 --> 00:32:30.720
in meaningful ways?

00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:35.650
So for example, if you have
you're showing the weather in

00:32:35.650 --> 00:32:38.070
Nairobi, Kenya, you need
business deals to get those

00:32:38.070 --> 00:32:39.530
feeds in meaningful ways.

00:32:39.530 --> 00:32:43.130
If you're showing the cricket
scores on the news page in

00:32:43.130 --> 00:32:46.095
India, again, you need
feeds to for you

00:32:46.095 --> 00:32:48.400
to show all of those.

00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.860
So now let's talk a little
bit about the resources.

00:32:50.860 --> 00:32:53.150
So first is the International
Components for Unicode.

00:32:53.150 --> 00:32:55.770
So I talked about using
the libraries.

00:32:55.770 --> 00:32:58.370
It provides you the libraries
for handling time zones,

00:32:58.370 --> 00:33:01.040
currencies, date formats,
and so on.

00:33:01.040 --> 00:33:03.110
It's available in
Java, C, C++.

00:33:03.110 --> 00:33:05.170
It's open sourced.

00:33:05.170 --> 00:33:06.820
It's been ported to Python.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:08.500
And, again, a number of
products, a number of

00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:10.180
companies are using
this today.

00:33:13.090 --> 00:33:16.120
Another important resource
is input tools.

00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.860
Research has clearly shown that
users are more likely to

00:33:18.860 --> 00:33:21.600
use your app, your product,
if they can input

00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.380
in their own language.

00:33:23.380 --> 00:33:27.270
That's where Google input
tools comes in.

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:30.680
It's a collection of tools that
provide users the ability

00:33:30.680 --> 00:33:34.010
to input irrespective of which
language they use,

00:33:34.010 --> 00:33:35.660
irrespective of which
form factor, which

00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:37.100
device, they're using.

00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:40.150
The tools that are offered in
this are transliteration,

00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:44.510
virtual keyboard, implemented
editors, speech, and writing.

00:33:44.510 --> 00:33:47.060
And, again, they are available
irrespective of where you are.

00:33:47.060 --> 00:33:50.680
If you are using Windows PC,
there's a Windows client.

00:33:50.680 --> 00:33:54.300
If you're using tablet or
mobile, you can get for

00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:56.530
Android devices from
Google Play store.

00:33:56.530 --> 00:33:59.880
If you're on the web, it's
already integrated in common

00:33:59.880 --> 00:34:00.340
Google products.

00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:04.930
So if you're using Gmail,
Search, Docs, Translate, all

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.860
of them are already there.

00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:13.739
And there's a Chrome extension
which allows you to integrate

00:34:13.739 --> 00:34:15.929
that in your own product
and service.

00:34:15.929 --> 00:34:18.604
So let me quickly show
you a video for that.

00:34:18.604 --> 00:34:24.532
[VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:34:24.532 --> 00:34:25.026
-Hi.

00:34:25.026 --> 00:34:26.014
I'm [INAUDIBLE].

00:34:26.014 --> 00:34:27.990
I'm a product manager
here at Google.

00:34:27.990 --> 00:34:30.460
And I'd like to talk to you
about Google's Input Tools

00:34:30.460 --> 00:34:31.942
Chrome extension.

00:34:31.942 --> 00:34:35.070
With the Google Input Tools
Chrome extension, you can use

00:34:35.070 --> 00:34:37.376
all of Google's great input
technologies, not just on

00:34:37.376 --> 00:34:41.822
Google products, but anywhere
you can input text on the web.

00:34:41.822 --> 00:34:50.100
To use the extension, first go
to google.com/inputtools.

00:34:50.100 --> 00:34:54.090
Click Try It Out and Install
Chrome extension.

00:34:54.090 --> 00:34:56.679
Alternatively, you can just
search the Chrome Web Store

00:34:56.679 --> 00:34:59.620
directly for Google
Input Tools.

00:34:59.620 --> 00:35:02.800
Click Add it to Chrome.

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.750
And once the Chrome extension's
installed, you'll

00:35:04.750 --> 00:35:08.330
see the icon up here
on your Chrome bar.

00:35:08.330 --> 00:35:11.670
Go ahead and click on it and
click on Extension Options to

00:35:11.670 --> 00:35:14.660
select which languages and
tools you want to use.

00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:18.780
As you can see, we support
over 70 languages.

00:35:18.780 --> 00:35:22.990
And many languages support
multiple input tools.

00:35:22.990 --> 00:35:30.930
I'll select Chinese Pinyin and
French virtual keyboard, and

00:35:30.930 --> 00:35:32.180
Hindi transliteration.

00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:36.770
Now that I've selected which
languages and input tools I

00:35:36.770 --> 00:35:39.390
want to use, I can use
it on any web page.

00:35:39.390 --> 00:35:44.330
For example, on Google+, I can
use Chinese Pinyin to type

00:35:44.330 --> 00:35:45.580
easily in Chinese.

00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:49.530
But it's not just
Google tools.

00:35:49.530 --> 00:35:51.720
You can also use it anywhere
else on the web.

00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.050
So for example, I can use Hindi
transliteration here on

00:35:55.050 --> 00:35:56.355
the Hindi version
of Wikipedia.

00:36:04.340 --> 00:36:07.290
We hope you find the Google
Input tools Chrome extension

00:36:07.290 --> 00:36:11.792
to be as fun and easy
to use as we do.

00:36:11.792 --> 00:36:17.160
[END VIDEO PLAYBACK]

00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:19.460
MANISH BHARGAVA: A few other
resource to talk about.

00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:19.840
[? Lib ?]

00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:20.960
Phone Number Library.

00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:24.280
It essentially helps you to
handle all international phone

00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.850
numbers it encapsulates all the
intricacies in terms of

00:36:27.850 --> 00:36:30.760
area codes, country codes,
and works for all

00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:32.220
regions of the world.

00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:35.770
It is useful for formatting,
storing, validating

00:36:35.770 --> 00:36:37.350
international phone numbers.

00:36:37.350 --> 00:36:39.730
And, again, used not only by
Google products but a lot of

00:36:39.730 --> 00:36:41.830
other companies as well.

00:36:41.830 --> 00:36:44.600
The lib address input,
very similar.

00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.690
It handles the international
address format.

00:36:47.690 --> 00:36:51.065
It's useful for the layout and
validations for all regions.

00:36:54.510 --> 00:36:58.070
Fonts, what you're looking at
is let's say a page doesn't

00:36:58.070 --> 00:37:04.730
have the right text to display
the page, in that case you'll

00:37:04.730 --> 00:37:08.640
see tofu, those squares
on the page.

00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:13.450
One aim that we are aiming for
is to remove all the tofus

00:37:13.450 --> 00:37:15.070
from the web.

00:37:15.070 --> 00:37:18.770
One step for doing that is
essentially creating a font

00:37:18.770 --> 00:37:22.080
that can handle all characters
in Unicode

00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:23.350
irrespective of the language.

00:37:23.350 --> 00:37:26.120
And we're calling the
Pan-Unicode font Noto, so

00:37:26.120 --> 00:37:28.080
short form for no tofu.

00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:28.940
This will be available.

00:37:28.940 --> 00:37:31.810
So the fonts are free for use,
for everyone to use.

00:37:31.810 --> 00:37:36.180
They will be available from
code.google.com/pnoto.

00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:40.330
That's where you will
find the font.

00:37:40.330 --> 00:37:43.480
And it's available under
the Apache license 2.2.

00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:46.640
Another useful tool
is the [? S ?]

00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:47.690
[? Fontly ?]

00:37:47.690 --> 00:37:48.890
library.

00:37:48.890 --> 00:37:54.290
It's a C++ and Java library
which helps you in creating,

00:37:54.290 --> 00:38:02.500
using, and editing
[? s fontly ?] container based

00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.090
fonts, so for example, the open
type or the TrueType.

00:38:05.090 --> 00:38:08.050
It is used, for example, by
the Google cloud print for

00:38:08.050 --> 00:38:13.680
subsetting the fonts
for PDF printing.

00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:15.670
So we have touched upon
the various steps

00:38:15.670 --> 00:38:16.800
that you need to have.

00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.010
We have talked about why

00:38:18.010 --> 00:38:19.540
internationalization makes sense.

00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:23.455
What I want to do next, logical
question is I have now

00:38:23.455 --> 00:38:24.620
a localized app.

00:38:24.620 --> 00:38:26.390
But how will I find the
global customers?

00:38:26.390 --> 00:38:28.410
Or how will the global
customers find me?

00:38:28.410 --> 00:38:31.970
So important steps in that
respect is I'm giving you some

00:38:31.970 --> 00:38:35.050
tips in terms of getting your,
marketing your, app in the

00:38:35.050 --> 00:38:36.780
marketplace in meaningful
ways.

00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.020
So first is localize your
marketplace metadata.

00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:44.610
That, by itself, making sure
your text, you title, your

00:38:44.610 --> 00:38:46.730
short description, long
descriptions are localized.

00:38:46.730 --> 00:38:49.140
That by itself will make sure
your app ranking goes up

00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.490
significantly.

00:38:50.490 --> 00:38:52.010
Maximize your search
potential.

00:38:52.010 --> 00:38:54.980
So know which are
key, key words.

00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:58.130
Include them in your short
description title, long

00:38:58.130 --> 00:38:59.150
descriptions.

00:38:59.150 --> 00:38:59.780
Why?

00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.460
Because, again, search accounts
for 2/3 of the total

00:39:02.460 --> 00:39:03.690
all installs.

00:39:03.690 --> 00:39:08.680
More than half of all Google
Play users look for apps on a

00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.800
weekly basis.

00:39:09.800 --> 00:39:12.780
And more than six million unique
phrases are searched on

00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:15.480
a daily basis.

00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:18.000
Sometimes some developers have
asked, well, can I just do a

00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:21.440
month of promotion and marketing
and will I be fine?

00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:22.240
Not really.

00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:25.730
Investing long term is the
right way to go from a

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.880
globalization efforts
perspective.

00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:32.130
And as we saw in the case study
on Autodesk, localizing

00:39:32.130 --> 00:39:35.380
app screenshots, reflecting the
actual user experience in

00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:37.420
the locale is very important.

00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:41.290
One, from getting more installs,
but more importantly

00:39:41.290 --> 00:39:44.210
for minimizing your number
of uninstalls.

00:39:44.210 --> 00:39:45.930
And that, again, is
a key factor in

00:39:45.930 --> 00:39:47.790
terms of your app ranking.

00:39:47.790 --> 00:39:50.390
So just to summarize, we've
talked about a number of

00:39:50.390 --> 00:39:51.210
things here.

00:39:51.210 --> 00:39:54.030
So if you forget most of this
stuff or you don't remember

00:39:54.030 --> 00:39:55.480
stuff, remember a few things.

00:39:55.480 --> 00:39:58.820
One, it makes sense to
go international.

00:39:58.820 --> 00:40:01.260
Two, it is really simple
to get started.

00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:02.730
Just remove your hard
coded stings.

00:40:02.730 --> 00:40:03.610
Externalize them.

00:40:03.610 --> 00:40:04.960
Use a few libraries.

00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.020
Get your family and friends
to help you to

00:40:07.020 --> 00:40:08.360
localize in one language.

00:40:08.360 --> 00:40:10.110
And that would be a good
starting point.

00:40:10.110 --> 00:40:12.980
And remember, there are lots of
resources available to you

00:40:12.980 --> 00:40:17.060
to help with respect
to i18n and l10n.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:18.235
The URL to remember,
developers.googl

00:40:18.235 --> 00:40:23.980
e.com/international.

00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:25.310
Again, we would love
the feedback.

00:40:25.310 --> 00:40:29.680
This the link to the survey.

00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.370
The QR code is right
there as well.

00:40:33.910 --> 00:40:35.330
Do we have time for
some questions?

00:40:35.330 --> 00:40:37.290
Why don't we take a few
questions and then I'll be

00:40:37.290 --> 00:40:38.700
available here.

00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:40.910
Yeah, come to the aisle.

00:40:40.910 --> 00:40:41.610
Go ahead.

00:40:41.610 --> 00:40:42.810
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:40:42.810 --> 00:40:46.060
I have an app on the Android
Marketer Google Play Store

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.430
that's about 300K in size
just in English.

00:40:50.430 --> 00:40:55.810
Each language I localize it
to adds another 50 or 60K.

00:40:55.810 --> 00:40:59.220
If I cover efigs I've doubled
the size of the app.

00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:01.220
Is that a problem?

00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:03.340
I mean, am I the only person
who think that's a problem?

00:41:03.340 --> 00:41:05.960
And is Google going to do
anything about that either by

00:41:05.960 --> 00:41:10.880
letting the market serve up
different versions of the app

00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:14.770
by language or adding support
for downloadable DLLs that

00:41:14.770 --> 00:41:16.780
include the localization?

00:41:16.780 --> 00:41:18.485
MANISH BHARGAVA: So if size
becomes an issue, one way to

00:41:18.485 --> 00:41:21.730
handle that is, again, you can
separate them by the language

00:41:21.730 --> 00:41:23.040
in meaningful ways.

00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:25.740
But, yes, if you have a
localized version, that is

00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:27.550
prioritized in terms of ranking
perspective and

00:41:27.550 --> 00:41:29.010
overall promoting that.

00:41:29.010 --> 00:41:30.866
So, again, getting the localized
version makes a big

00:41:30.866 --> 00:41:31.580
difference.

00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:34.990
AUDIENCE: So I could build
a separate APK

00:41:34.990 --> 00:41:35.890
for each of the languages?

00:41:35.890 --> 00:41:36.410
MANISH BHARGAVA: Yes.

00:41:36.410 --> 00:41:36.940
AUDIENCE: Perfect.

00:41:36.940 --> 00:41:37.160
Thank you.

00:41:37.160 --> 00:41:39.080
MANISH BHARGAVA: Yes,
that works.

00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:40.520
Yes.

00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.920
AUDIENCE: Hi, my name is
[? Kel Hoyoshoka ?]

00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:42.630
from Hawaii.

00:41:42.630 --> 00:41:44.600
And first I just want to say
thank you very much for

00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:48.860
providing a Hawaiian language
version of Google for us and

00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:52.240
also for the Maori
from New Zealand.

00:41:52.240 --> 00:41:55.040
The input tools, however, does
not have our Hawaiian keyboard

00:41:55.040 --> 00:41:56.120
or our Maori keyboard.

00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:58.080
And we've been trying to find
somebody to talk to about

00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:00.170
adding that in for
the Unicode set?

00:42:00.170 --> 00:42:02.890
Are you the right person
and is the right place?

00:42:02.890 --> 00:42:05.360
MANISH BHARGAVA: Yes, so
we can talk about that.

00:42:05.360 --> 00:42:07.610
Yes, I agree with you,
input tools doesn't

00:42:07.610 --> 00:42:08.690
support that today.

00:42:08.690 --> 00:42:09.570
But we can talk about that.

00:42:09.570 --> 00:42:12.890
And what we need is,
essentially, a dedicated team

00:42:12.890 --> 00:42:15.890
who can provide us the
meaningful inputs and it could

00:42:15.890 --> 00:42:16.510
be incorporated.

00:42:16.510 --> 00:42:18.540
That's how we did the Hawaiian
version, for example.

00:42:18.540 --> 00:42:20.720
So we can talk about that.

00:42:20.720 --> 00:42:21.840
Yes.

00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:23.740
AUDIENCE: Hello, my name is
Sean from [INAUDIBLE]

00:42:23.740 --> 00:42:24.520
translations.

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.870
And we own a localization
firm.

00:42:27.870 --> 00:42:31.030
And I would like to know how
to reach out more to the

00:42:31.030 --> 00:42:35.020
Android developers and Google
Developers so that we can

00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:37.700
actually become a vendor for
a lot of these firms.

00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:38.350
And also--

00:42:38.350 --> 00:42:40.980
OK, go ahead.

00:42:40.980 --> 00:42:46.240
MANISH BHARGAVA: So, as I said,
the initial pilot phase

00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.260
launched yesterday.

00:42:48.260 --> 00:42:51.500
The way to get yourself enrolled
is-- as we said, the

00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:53.070
initial pilot is with
six vendors.

00:42:53.070 --> 00:42:55.700
But we are looking to expand
and scale all of that.

00:42:55.700 --> 00:43:00.110
So, again, GPM vendor
support is the right

00:43:00.110 --> 00:43:00.470
mailing list to use.

00:43:00.470 --> 00:43:02.750
And that's where you
can send a note.

00:43:02.750 --> 00:43:05.270
And, again, we can talk
in details here.

00:43:05.270 --> 00:43:06.980
And that's where we
can get started.

00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:07.450
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:43:07.450 --> 00:43:08.860
Thank you.

00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:10.570
MANISH BHARGAVA: Yes.

00:43:10.570 --> 00:43:10.750
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:43:10.750 --> 00:43:13.950
My name is Tanya from
TED conferences.

00:43:13.950 --> 00:43:19.140
We're queuing up for an app
release that's localized.

00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:20.850
And I have two questions.

00:43:20.850 --> 00:43:26.420
The first is if the app is
localized in Spanish, yes, is

00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:29.860
it offensive to release
it in Mexico?

00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:32.810
MANISH BHARGAVA: OK,
very good question.

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:36.450
So there are nuances in terms
or Spanish version in Latin

00:43:36.450 --> 00:43:39.270
America, specifically
in Mexico, versus

00:43:39.270 --> 00:43:40.990
Spanish as in Spain.

00:43:40.990 --> 00:43:42.400
It is not offensive.

00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.270
But it is not very
user friendly.

00:43:44.270 --> 00:43:49.070
So when somebody in Mexico looks
at Spanish as in Spain,

00:43:49.070 --> 00:43:50.620
they can kind of
understand it.

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:52.380
But they do realize that
it is not something

00:43:52.380 --> 00:43:53.990
which is made for them.

00:43:53.990 --> 00:43:56.100
So they would be like,
yes, I can use it.

00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:59.010
It's usable, versus
the love factor.

00:43:59.010 --> 00:44:02.330
I just want to use it comes when
you have more localized

00:44:02.330 --> 00:44:04.660
version. es-419, does
that for example.

00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:07.920
AUDIENCE: Do you recommend
that we do it or don't?

00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:09.850
MANISH BHARGAVA: The es-419,
which essentially does it for

00:44:09.850 --> 00:44:12.050
all of Latin American, unless
you are very specifically

00:44:12.050 --> 00:44:15.090
targeting Mexico then you
can explore the es's

00:44:15.090 --> 00:44:16.090
in Mexico as well.

00:44:16.090 --> 00:44:16.460
AUDIENCE: OK.

00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:20.990
And then the second question,
all about offending people, is

00:44:20.990 --> 00:44:24.640
that in the app you
can kind of browse

00:44:24.640 --> 00:44:27.050
content through tags.

00:44:27.050 --> 00:44:31.840
And tags are not translated
because it's dynamic.

00:44:31.840 --> 00:44:35.960
So even though the UI and
everything is localized, the

00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:37.810
content translation, everything
is localized.

00:44:37.810 --> 00:44:41.910
The only thing that
isn't are tags.

00:44:41.910 --> 00:44:45.620
Is it better to just leave it in
English or is it better to

00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:47.650
remove it as a feature?

00:44:47.650 --> 00:44:50.400
MANISH BHARGAVA: I think as a
good starting point, leaving

00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.610
them in English is a good
starting point.

00:44:52.610 --> 00:44:55.920
And, again, we can talk about
how you can handle the dynamic

00:44:55.920 --> 00:44:57.800
aspects of those So, again,
I'll be available here.

00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.090
So just in the interest
of time, I know

00:45:00.090 --> 00:45:01.040
this is lunch time.

00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:04.050
So thank you everyone
for coming.

00:45:04.050 --> 00:45:07.600
Read the sessions and
enjoy the lunch.

00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:08.300
I'll be here available.

00:45:08.300 --> 00:45:10.500
If you have further questions,
I can answer those.
