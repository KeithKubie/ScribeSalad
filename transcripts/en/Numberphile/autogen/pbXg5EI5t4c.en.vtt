I've got 10 cards here I'm going to
 

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:04.220
I've got 10 cards here I'm going to
shuffle them up they're just one to ten

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:04.230
shuffle them up they're just one to ten
 

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:06.740
shuffle them up they're just one to ten
or eight to ten you can see there look a

00:00:06.740 --> 00:00:06.750

ten apart nine not seven four so I'm

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:10.320
ten apart nine not seven four so I'm
 

00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.780
ten apart nine not seven four so I'm
just going to shuffle them up and then

00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:11.790
just going to shuffle them up and then
 

00:00:11.790 --> 00:00:13.940
just going to shuffle them up and then
they lay them out our calories it looks

00:00:13.940 --> 00:00:13.950
they lay them out our calories it looks
 

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:14.930
they lay them out our calories it looks
like you've got the world's smallest

00:00:14.930 --> 00:00:14.940
like you've got the world's smallest
 

00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:18.380
like you've got the world's smallest
hands these are normal sized cards aunt

00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:18.390
hands these are normal sized cards aunt
 

00:00:18.390 --> 00:00:21.140
hands these are normal sized cards aunt
as a tiny person I'm going to lay these

00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:21.150
as a tiny person I'm going to lay these
 

00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:21.710
as a tiny person I'm going to lay these
out

00:00:21.710 --> 00:00:21.720
out
 

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.109
out
I'll count along when I lay them out and

00:00:24.109 --> 00:00:24.119
I'll count along when I lay them out and
 

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:28.849
I'll count along when I lay them out and
I win if the position matches its value

00:00:28.849 --> 00:00:28.859
I win if the position matches its value
 

00:00:28.859 --> 00:00:32.240
I win if the position matches its value
which means if ace comes out first I win

00:00:32.240 --> 00:00:32.250
which means if ace comes out first I win
 

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.630
which means if ace comes out first I win
if if the four comes out fourth I win

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:35.640
if if the four comes out fourth I win
 

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.090
if if the four comes out fourth I win
okay now what's the chance of me winning

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.100
okay now what's the chance of me winning
 

00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:40.069
okay now what's the chance of me winning
this game as are my likely to get a

00:00:40.069 --> 00:00:40.079
this game as are my likely to get a
 

00:00:40.079 --> 00:00:42.170
this game as are my likely to get a
match that's the question am I likely to

00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:42.180
match that's the question am I likely to
 

00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:43.670
match that's the question am I likely to
can match do you think it's likely do

00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:43.680
can match do you think it's likely do
 

00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:45.590
can match do you think it's likely do
you think it's unlikely do you think

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:45.600
you think it's unlikely do you think
 

00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:47.930
you think it's unlikely do you think
it's greater than 50% do you think it's

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:47.940
it's greater than 50% do you think it's
 

00:00:47.940 --> 00:01:02.840
it's greater than 50% do you think it's
less than 50% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ah 10 so

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:02.850
less than 50% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ah 10 so
 

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:05.240
less than 50% 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 ah 10 so
I got no match now is that what you

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:05.250
I got no match now is that what you
 

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:07.340
I got no match now is that what you
expected did you expect me to get no

00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:07.350
expected did you expect me to get no
 

00:01:07.350 --> 00:01:09.950
expected did you expect me to get no
match well actually I think I was quite

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:09.960
match well actually I think I was quite
 

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:12.830
match well actually I think I was quite
unlucky there to get no match because

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:12.840
unlucky there to get no match because
 

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.490
unlucky there to get no match because
the probability of having no match is

00:01:15.490 --> 00:01:15.500
the probability of having no match is
 

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:18.859
the probability of having no match is
37% so poverty of getting one match

00:01:18.859 --> 00:01:18.869
37% so poverty of getting one match
 

00:01:18.869 --> 00:01:21.980
37% so poverty of getting one match
winning the game would have been 63% so

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:21.990
winning the game would have been 63% so
 

00:01:21.990 --> 00:01:24.289
winning the game would have been 63% so
it's actually more likely to win over

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:24.299
it's actually more likely to win over
 

00:01:24.299 --> 00:01:27.770
it's actually more likely to win over
fifty Cent not a huge amount over 50% so

00:01:27.770 --> 00:01:27.780
fifty Cent not a huge amount over 50% so
 

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.440
fifty Cent not a huge amount over 50% so
it can go wrong okay so you can lose

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:30.450
it can go wrong okay so you can lose
 

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.179
it can go wrong okay so you can lose
this game if you're especially unlucky

00:01:32.179 --> 00:01:32.189
this game if you're especially unlucky
 

00:01:32.189 --> 00:01:35.240
this game if you're especially unlucky
good yeah like me if you're unlucky like

00:01:35.240 --> 00:01:35.250
good yeah like me if you're unlucky like
 

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:38.569
good yeah like me if you're unlucky like
me you might lose this game but I use 10

00:01:38.569 --> 00:01:38.579
me you might lose this game but I use 10
 

00:01:38.579 --> 00:01:40.580
me you might lose this game but I use 10
cards here and the probability of

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:40.590
cards here and the probability of
 

00:01:40.590 --> 00:01:45.109
cards here and the probability of
winning with 10 cards is 63% do you

00:01:45.109 --> 00:01:45.119
winning with 10 cards is 63% do you
 

00:01:45.119 --> 00:01:48.050
winning with 10 cards is 63% do you
think then if I had 100 cards am I more

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060
think then if I had 100 cards am I more
 

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:50.749
think then if I had 100 cards am I more
likely to get a match or less likely to

00:01:50.749 --> 00:01:50.759
likely to get a match or less likely to
 

00:01:50.759 --> 00:01:53.480
likely to get a match or less likely to
get a match well I can tell you it's

00:01:53.480 --> 00:01:53.490
get a match well I can tell you it's
 

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.999
get a match well I can tell you it's
still 63% it doesn't matter doesn't

00:01:55.999 --> 00:01:56.009
still 63% it doesn't matter doesn't
 

00:01:56.009 --> 00:01:58.249
still 63% it doesn't matter doesn't
matter how many cards you have it's a

00:01:58.249 --> 00:01:58.259
matter how many cards you have it's a
 

00:01:58.259 --> 00:02:01.399
matter how many cards you have it's a
constant it's going to be 63% no matter

00:02:01.399 --> 00:02:01.409
constant it's going to be 63% no matter
 

00:02:01.409 --> 00:02:03.550
constant it's going to be 63% no matter
how many cards you have or if it's to go

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:03.560
how many cards you have or if it's to go
 

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:06.590
how many cards you have or if it's to go
okay you caught me out there I was going

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:06.600
okay you caught me out there I was going
 

00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:07.880
okay you caught me out there I was going
to get to that I was going to get to

00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:07.890
to get to that I was going to get to
 

00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:12.190
to get to that I was going to get to
that it's 63% if you use 4 or more cards

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:12.200
that it's 63% if you use 4 or more cards
 

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400
that it's 63% if you use 4 or more cards
so

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:13.410
so
 

00:02:13.410 --> 00:02:15.560
so
pretty much any game okay so you don't

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:15.570
pretty much any game okay so you don't
 

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.250
pretty much any game okay so you don't
again that uses three and two and one is

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:18.260
again that uses three and two and one is
 

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.460
again that uses three and two and one is
not

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:19.470
not
 

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:23.390
not
63% but hey four or more and you will

00:02:23.390 --> 00:02:23.400
63% but hey four or more and you will
 

00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.340
63% but hey four or more and you will
always get 63% chance of winning that's

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:25.350
always get 63% chance of winning that's
 

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.380
always get 63% chance of winning that's
a that's a constant so the way you solve

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:27.390
a that's a constant so the way you solve
 

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.100
a that's a constant so the way you solve
this problem

00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.110
this problem
 

00:02:28.110 --> 00:02:31.130
this problem
it's about matches getting a match or

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:31.140
it's about matches getting a match or
 

00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.010
it's about matches getting a match or
not getting a match and these things

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:34.020
not getting a match and these things
 

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:35.870
not getting a match and these things
where you are not looking for a match is

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:35.880
where you are not looking for a match is
 

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.790
where you are not looking for a match is
called as an arrangement at the

00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:37.800
called as an arrangement at the
 

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:41.210
called as an arrangement at the
arrangement which is such fun to say so

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:41.220
arrangement which is such fun to say so
 

00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.890
arrangement which is such fun to say so
we're going to get the range so let's do

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:42.900
we're going to get the range so let's do
 

00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.410
we're going to get the range so let's do
that so if you're mixing up cards or any

00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:45.420
that so if you're mixing up cards or any
 

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:46.490
that so if you're mixing up cards or any
objects like that

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:46.500
objects like that
 

00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:48.200
objects like that
that's called a permutation or you might

00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:48.210
that's called a permutation or you might
 

00:02:48.210 --> 00:02:50.390
that's called a permutation or you might
call it an arrangement maybe that's a

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:50.400
call it an arrangement maybe that's a
 

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:52.790
call it an arrangement maybe that's a
word you would use if I had say five

00:02:52.790 --> 00:02:52.800
word you would use if I had say five
 

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.170
word you would use if I had say five
things

00:02:54.170 --> 00:02:54.180
things
 

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:57.350
things
let's do five dots I have five dots here

00:02:57.350 --> 00:02:57.360
let's do five dots I have five dots here
 

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:00.590
let's do five dots I have five dots here
and then I could arrange them in any way

00:03:00.590 --> 00:03:00.600
and then I could arrange them in any way
 

00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.150
and then I could arrange them in any way
I'm going to do that with arrows to show

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:02.160
I'm going to do that with arrows to show
 

00:03:02.160 --> 00:03:05.900
I'm going to do that with arrows to show
that you know one becomes two two

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:05.910
that you know one becomes two two
 

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:11.120
that you know one becomes two two
becomes three let's say three becomes

00:03:11.120 --> 00:03:11.130
becomes three let's say three becomes
 

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.210
becomes three let's say three becomes
five say four goes across to four and

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:14.220
five say four goes across to four and
 

00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:17.300
five say four goes across to four and
five becomes one like that so you can

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:17.310
five becomes one like that so you can
 

00:03:17.310 --> 00:03:19.400
five becomes one like that so you can
have any kind of scramble like that so

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:19.410
have any kind of scramble like that so
 

00:03:19.410 --> 00:03:20.690
have any kind of scramble like that so
how many ways can you scramble those

00:03:20.690 --> 00:03:20.700
how many ways can you scramble those
 

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.030
how many ways can you scramble those
objects well that's n factorial in

00:03:23.030 --> 00:03:23.040
objects well that's n factorial in
 

00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.790
objects well that's n factorial in
general so there are n factorial ways

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:25.800
general so there are n factorial ways
 

00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:29.930
general so there are n factorial ways
you can scramble up and objects number

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:29.940
you can scramble up and objects number
 

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:32.330
you can scramble up and objects number
where number of permutations n factorial

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:32.340
where number of permutations n factorial
 

00:03:32.340 --> 00:03:36.170
where number of permutations n factorial
now a derangement is a permutation that

00:03:36.170 --> 00:03:36.180
now a derangement is a permutation that
 

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.400
now a derangement is a permutation that
has no fixed points now this is not a

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:40.410
has no fixed points now this is not a
 

00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.910
has no fixed points now this is not a
derangement look for went to four it's

00:03:43.910 --> 00:03:43.920
derangement look for went to four it's
 

00:03:43.920 --> 00:03:45.830
derangement look for went to four it's
fixed it didn't change that's not a

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:45.840
fixed it didn't change that's not a
 

00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:47.810
fixed it didn't change that's not a
derangement so the arrangement is

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:47.820
derangement so the arrangement is
 

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.860
derangement so the arrangement is
something like that but there are no

00:03:50.860 --> 00:03:50.870
something like that but there are no
 

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:53.240
something like that but there are no
fixed point so if I did the same sort of

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:53.250
fixed point so if I did the same sort of
 

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:59.060
fixed point so if I did the same sort of
idea and drawn in a derangement would

00:03:59.060 --> 00:03:59.070
idea and drawn in a derangement would
 

00:03:59.070 --> 00:04:04.610
idea and drawn in a derangement would
mean yeah something like this maybe like

00:04:04.610 --> 00:04:04.620
mean yeah something like this maybe like
 

00:04:04.620 --> 00:04:07.550
mean yeah something like this maybe like
that and maybe it's something down there

00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:07.560
that and maybe it's something down there
 

00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:08.540
that and maybe it's something down there
there you go

00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:08.550
there you go
 

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.490
there you go
that would be a valid arrangement and

00:04:10.490 --> 00:04:10.500
that would be a valid arrangement and
 

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.680
that would be a valid arrangement and
the symbol for derangement so how many

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:12.690
the symbol for derangement so how many
 

00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:15.380
the symbol for derangement so how many
derangements are there so it's a subset

00:04:15.380 --> 00:04:15.390
derangements are there so it's a subset
 

00:04:15.390 --> 00:04:18.470
derangements are there so it's a subset
of permutations so there's fewer and the

00:04:18.470 --> 00:04:18.480
of permutations so there's fewer and the
 

00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:20.030
of permutations so there's fewer and the
number of arrangements has this symbol

00:04:20.030 --> 00:04:20.040
number of arrangements has this symbol
 

00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.170
number of arrangements has this symbol
it's escalation mark n it's like a

backwards factorials now how many of

00:04:27.110 --> 00:04:27.120
backwards factorials now how many of
 

00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:29.360
backwards factorials now how many of
these are their well there's a formula

accidentally had a derangement I didn't

00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:18.810
accidentally had a derangement I didn't
 

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:21.529
accidentally had a derangement I didn't
plan it so I just went and saw what

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:21.539
plan it so I just went and saw what
 

00:05:21.539 --> 00:05:23.180

happened so we thought you lost but

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:23.190
happened so we thought you lost but
 

00:05:23.190 --> 00:05:25.460
happened so we thought you lost but
you're a genius well I didn't plan it

00:05:25.460 --> 00:05:25.470
you're a genius well I didn't plan it
 

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:29.120
you're a genius well I didn't plan it
but it works out for this video so if

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:29.130
but it works out for this video so if
 

00:05:29.130 --> 00:05:30.800
but it works out for this video so if
you want to find the probability of no

00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:30.810
you want to find the probability of no
 

00:05:30.810 --> 00:05:33.020
you want to find the probability of no
fixed points it's how many Arrangements

00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:33.030
fixed points it's how many Arrangements
 

00:05:33.030 --> 00:05:35.600
fixed points it's how many Arrangements
we have so this is equal to number of

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:35.610
we have so this is equal to number of
 

00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.969
we have so this is equal to number of
derangement divided by the total number

00:05:37.969 --> 00:05:37.979
derangement divided by the total number
 

00:05:37.979 --> 00:05:40.940
derangement divided by the total number
of ways I could have scrambled up those

00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:40.950
of ways I could have scrambled up those
 

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.580
of ways I could have scrambled up those
n objects which is the total number of

00:05:43.580 --> 00:05:43.590
n objects which is the total number of
 

00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.379
n objects which is the total number of
permutations so this is the probability

00:05:45.379 --> 00:05:45.389
permutations so this is the probability
 

00:05:45.389 --> 00:05:48.560
permutations so this is the probability
of no fixed points you're taking all

00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:48.570
of no fixed points you're taking all
 

00:05:48.570 --> 00:05:50.270
of no fixed points you're taking all
these arrangements and dividing by all

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:50.280
these arrangements and dividing by all
 

00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:53.060
these arrangements and dividing by all
the possible permutations and we have a

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:53.070
the possible permutations and we have a
 

00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:55.070
the possible permutations and we have a
formula for that and so this is going to

00:05:55.070 --> 00:05:55.080
formula for that and so this is going to
 

00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:58.550
formula for that and so this is going to
be approximately 1 over e which is going

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:58.560
be approximately 1 over e which is going
 

00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:04.730
be approximately 1 over e which is going
to be not 0.37 which is why it's 37% to

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:04.740
to be not 0.37 which is why it's 37% to
 

00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:07.700
to be not 0.37 which is why it's 37% to
get a derangement or 63% to get a match

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:07.710
get a derangement or 63% to get a match
 

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:10.370
get a derangement or 63% to get a match
which is the opposite question so one of

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:10.380
which is the opposite question so one of
 

00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:11.960
which is the opposite question so one of
the classic versions of this same

the classic versions of this same
 

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.760
the classic versions of this same
problem is called the secretary problem

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:13.770
problem is called the secretary problem
 

00:06:13.770 --> 00:06:16.760
problem is called the secretary problem
so imagine having a secretary and that

00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:16.770
so imagine having a secretary and that
 

00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:19.370
so imagine having a secretary and that
person's got letters to various people

00:06:19.370 --> 00:06:19.380
person's got letters to various people
 

00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:22.219
person's got letters to various people
and they've got envelopes for those same

00:06:22.219 --> 00:06:22.229
and they've got envelopes for those same
 

00:06:22.229 --> 00:06:24.260
and they've got envelopes for those same
people so you need to put the letters in

00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:24.270
people so you need to put the letters in
 

00:06:24.270 --> 00:06:26.089
people so you need to put the letters in
the right envelopes so that secretary

00:06:26.089 --> 00:06:26.099
the right envelopes so that secretary
 

00:06:26.099 --> 00:06:27.589
the right envelopes so that secretary

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:29.580
trying to get out the door right so
 

00:06:29.580 --> 00:06:32.870
trying to get out the door right so
they're just quickly shoving in letters

00:06:32.870 --> 00:06:32.880
they're just quickly shoving in letters
 

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.899
they're just quickly shoving in letters
into envelopes what's the probability

00:06:35.899 --> 00:06:35.909

ends up in the right envelope and that's

00:06:42.399 --> 00:06:42.409
ends up in the right envelope and that's
 

00:06:42.409 --> 00:06:47.289

that sounds very old-fashioned but they
 

00:07:01.009 --> 00:07:03.659
that sounds very old-fashioned but they
put them in boxes and then they just

you start asking questions about these

00:07:49.149 --> 00:07:49.159
you start asking questions about these
 

00:07:49.159 --> 00:07:51.519
you start asking questions about these
people did so many people didn't so many

00:07:51.519 --> 00:07:51.529
people did so many people didn't so many
 

00:07:51.529 --> 00:07:53.350
people did so many people didn't so many
people did and it gets more complicated

00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:53.360
people did and it gets more complicated
 

00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.719
people did and it gets more complicated
to work out so this formula I've just

00:07:55.719 --> 00:07:55.729
to work out so this formula I've just
 

00:07:55.729 --> 00:07:58.269
to work out so this formula I've just
given you seems to come out of nowhere I

00:07:58.269 --> 00:07:58.279
given you seems to come out of nowhere I
 

00:07:58.279 --> 00:08:00.519
given you seems to come out of nowhere I
want to show you where that formula

00:08:00.519 --> 00:08:00.529
want to show you where that formula
 

00:08:00.529 --> 00:08:04.299
want to show you where that formula
comes from but this is going to be for

00:08:04.299 --> 00:08:04.309
comes from but this is going to be for
 

00:08:04.309 --> 00:08:07.149
comes from but this is going to be for
the dedicated viewer I think it's not a

00:08:07.149 --> 00:08:07.159
the dedicated viewer I think it's not a
 

00:08:07.159 --> 00:08:10.629
the dedicated viewer I think it's not a
simple proof but I think it's doable but

00:08:10.629 --> 00:08:10.639
simple proof but I think it's doable but
 

00:08:10.639 --> 00:08:12.009
simple proof but I think it's doable but
we're going to try all right let's let's

00:08:12.009 --> 00:08:12.019
we're going to try all right let's let's
 

00:08:12.019 --> 00:08:17.859
we're going to try all right let's let's
see where that formula came from so

00:08:17.859 --> 00:08:17.869
see where that formula came from so
 

00:08:17.869 --> 00:08:20.409
see where that formula came from so
imagine having all the possible

00:08:20.409 --> 00:08:20.419
imagine having all the possible
 

00:08:20.419 --> 00:08:22.359
imagine having all the possible
permutations right it's the set of all

00:08:22.359 --> 00:08:22.369
permutations right it's the set of all
 

00:08:22.369 --> 00:08:24.219
permutations right it's the set of all
possible permutations I'm actually going

00:08:24.219 --> 00:08:24.229
possible permutations I'm actually going
 

00:08:24.229 --> 00:08:26.979
possible permutations I'm actually going
to draw a Venn diagram so these are all

00:08:26.979 --> 00:08:26.989
to draw a Venn diagram so these are all
 

00:08:26.989 --> 00:08:29.499
to draw a Venn diagram so these are all
the possible permutations that you can

00:08:29.499 --> 00:08:29.509
the possible permutations that you can
 

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:32.499
the possible permutations that you can
have which means there are
