1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:05,690
Uncle Jake wanted to tell a story about
a fighter pilot that he knew when he was

2
00:00:05,691 --> 00:00:10,691
a kid and this fighter pilot taught
uncle Jake some very important lessons.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:14,900
So here is a story from Uncle Jake

4
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,243
when I was a kid,

5
00:00:19,420 --> 00:00:23,890
I had a kid in my fourth grade class named
Jonathan that sat behind me in class.

6
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:28,810
He wasn't really my friend, but he
was friends with some of my friends.

7
00:00:28,811 --> 00:00:33,700
And this boy Jonathan used to talk
all the time, talk, talk, talk, talk,

8
00:00:33,701 --> 00:00:37,900
talk. And it really annoyed
me. Not only did he talk,

9
00:00:37,901 --> 00:00:42,220
but he had a voice that kind of came
out through his nose and it made it even

10
00:00:42,221 --> 00:00:46,780
more annoying. He would say, Hey, when
are you guys doing? What are you up to?

11
00:00:46,781 --> 00:00:48,130
What are you doing? What's happening? How?

12
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,520
How are you guys doing
nonstop all the time.

13
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:57,460
And the more I was around him, the more
I got annoyed. Sometimes I even got angry

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:01,570
one day.
It really started to get to me.

15
00:01:02,110 --> 00:01:04,540
So I told him to just be quiet.

16
00:01:05,830 --> 00:01:06,100
Okay.

17
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,890
And he was quiet for a little while,
but not for very long.

18
00:01:09,820 --> 00:01:14,170
And then it was talk, talk, talk,
talk, talk again, talk, talk, talk.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:15,730
Yeah.

20
00:01:15,730 --> 00:01:19,870
I couldn't stand it. It was
so aggravating. Finally,

21
00:01:20,020 --> 00:01:21,940
one day I got super annoyed.

22
00:01:22,570 --> 00:01:26,260
We were sitting on the ground during
reading time and how it's just trying to

23
00:01:26,261 --> 00:01:28,990
read and he kept talking.

24
00:01:30,730 --> 00:01:33,610
I'd had enough and I finally
looked at him and I said,

25
00:01:33,760 --> 00:01:36,580
would you just shut your mouth

26
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:43,210
only instead of saying it quietly because
I was so mad. It came out way too loud,

27
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:48,580
so loud that everyone in the
classroom heard me say it,

28
00:01:48,581 --> 00:01:53,581
including the teacher and my teacher
did not like that at all and I got in

29
00:01:54,701 --> 00:01:58,090
trouble. The teacher,
Mrs Tally was her name.

30
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:01,330
She came over and sent me
to the principal's office.

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:06,120
I was the one that got sent to the
principal's office even though it was

32
00:02:06,121 --> 00:02:10,080
Jonathan had been talking. Now what
was I going to do? As you can imagine,

33
00:02:10,081 --> 00:02:13,020
the principal called my house and
told my parents I had been in trouble.

34
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:19,530
Now pay attention here because I have
to tell you another part of the story.

35
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:22,410
It's a story within a story,

36
00:02:22,411 --> 00:02:27,411
but it will lead back to Jonathan and
how that whole situation turned out.

37
00:02:28,141 --> 00:02:30,660
You see, there was a man that
used to come over to our house.

38
00:02:30,661 --> 00:02:34,440
Sometimes he was older than my dad,
but not by much.

39
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:39,780
My Dad called him captain.
The captain had been in the navy,

40
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:44,760
but he didn't drive ships.
He was a pilot in the navy.

41
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,180
He flew planes and during the Vietnam War,

42
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:53,850
his plane was shot down and he parachuted
to the ground, but when he landed,

43
00:02:53,851 --> 00:02:58,380
he was surrounded by the enemy and they
captured him and put him into a prisoner

44
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:01,630
of war camp and it was an awful place.

45
00:03:02,930 --> 00:03:03,763
Yeah,

46
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:08,080
there was horrible food and they didn't
get much of it and the water made them

47
00:03:08,081 --> 00:03:13,081
sick and they lived in baron rooms called
prison cells and it was hot and it was

48
00:03:13,271 --> 00:03:14,104
miserable

49
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:21,030
and the prisoners were treated
horribly by the guards in the prison.

50
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,110
They were beaten and they were starved
and they were given no freedom to do

51
00:03:25,111 --> 00:03:25,944
anything.

52
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:32,940
The only good thing that the prisoners
had is that they were not alone.

53
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,940
There were other prisoners.

54
00:03:35,941 --> 00:03:40,941
They're mostly other pilots that had
been shot down and most of the time they

55
00:03:40,981 --> 00:03:45,000
lived with each other in
these tiny prison cells.

56
00:03:45,250 --> 00:03:46,083
Okay.

57
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,940
I only knew about all this because my
dad had told me what had happened to the

58
00:03:50,941 --> 00:03:53,440
captain.
Well,

59
00:03:53,441 --> 00:03:58,441
after I got in trouble at school for
getting annoyed at Jonathan who talked all

60
00:03:59,201 --> 00:04:01,060
the time and I yelled at him,

61
00:04:01,150 --> 00:04:04,900
my dad invited the
captain over to my house.

62
00:04:06,170 --> 00:04:06,370
Yeah.

63
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:09,370
And my dad said that the captain
wanted to tell me something.

64
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:15,220
Then when we sat down after dinner,
the captain looked at me

65
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,960
and started to talk and
when the captain talked,

66
00:04:20,980 --> 00:04:21,880
everybody listened.

67
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:23,180
Yeah.

68
00:04:23,180 --> 00:04:28,180
The captain spoke slowly and clearly and
you could tell that he meant every word

69
00:04:29,660 --> 00:04:30,740
he said,

70
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:36,130
and this is what he told me
that night. He said, Jake,

71
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:37,630
okay,

72
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:39,220
I know you got into
some trouble at school.

73
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:40,630
Yeah,

74
00:04:40,630 --> 00:04:44,380
I know you've got annoyed with another
kid and yelled at him during class.

75
00:04:46,210 --> 00:04:50,410
Now I want to tell you something.
When I was a fighter pilot,

76
00:04:50,411 --> 00:04:53,860
I was shot down and got
captured by the enemy.

77
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:58,880
I was put into a prison camp
and it was a horrible place.

78
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:01,040
And in that prison we had cellmates.

79
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:02,150
Okay.

80
00:05:02,150 --> 00:05:06,530
Those were the other prisoners that we
lived with and the rooms were small and

81
00:05:06,531 --> 00:05:11,150
we were hungry and we were sick and
we were tired and we were miserable.

82
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:14,493
And in that

83
00:05:15,370 --> 00:05:17,830
terrible situation,
it would be very,

84
00:05:17,860 --> 00:05:22,360
very easy for me to get annoyed
with my cellmates. In fact,

85
00:05:22,420 --> 00:05:24,760
we all could have gotten
annoyed with each other.

86
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:26,750
Okay.

87
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:31,490
Maybe my cellmate snored or maybe
he coughed all day and all night.

88
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:36,530
Or maybe he cracked his knuckles all
the time or picked his nose or scratched

89
00:05:36,531 --> 00:05:40,250
his feet in a gross way.
That made me really annoyed.

90
00:05:42,930 --> 00:05:43,763
But Jake,

91
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:50,470
I was in that prison camp with
those other guys for six years.

92
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:52,403
Okay.

93
00:05:52,780 --> 00:05:54,220
Six years.

94
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:55,993
Yeah.

95
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,510
That is a long, long, long time.

96
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:00,950
Yeah.

97
00:06:00,950 --> 00:06:05,840
To be in prison. And that is a
long, long, long time to be annoyed.

98
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:12,340
And in that prison we didn't have
many other choices for friends.

99
00:06:13,610 --> 00:06:16,640
It was just us and our cell mates.
That's it.

100
00:06:17,340 --> 00:06:18,173
Okay.

101
00:06:19,190 --> 00:06:20,690
So we came up with a rule

102
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:25,790
and the rule was that
if someone annoyed us,

103
00:06:25,970 --> 00:06:27,920
it wasn't their fault.

104
00:06:29,810 --> 00:06:34,450
It was our fault.
It was our fault.

105
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:40,150
If we let their snoring bother us,
if my roommate snort,

106
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,710
it was my fault. If I let that
bother me, it was my fault.

107
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,360
If I got aggravated at the way
my cellmate scratched his feet,

108
00:06:51,320 --> 00:06:52,310
it was my fault.

109
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:57,410
If I couldn't stand the way that my cell
mate coughed or talked to or cracked

110
00:06:57,411 --> 00:07:01,650
his knuckles,
it was my fault.

111
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:03,270
That was the rule.

112
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:08,500
We couldn't allow
ourselves to get annoyed.

113
00:07:10,500 --> 00:07:13,920
Being annoyed would've
made that prison much,

114
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:17,970
much worse than it already was,
and we couldn't have that

115
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:21,080
and we didn't have that

116
00:07:23,190 --> 00:07:24,023
ever.

117
00:07:25,910 --> 00:07:29,510
So Jake,
if you let someone annoys you,

118
00:07:30,470 --> 00:07:35,030
you're allowing something that
shouldn't control you to control you.

119
00:07:35,210 --> 00:07:40,180
You're letting it get inside your head.
And I know you're young,

120
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:42,400
but that's no excuse.
You can't do that.

121
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:48,910
You have to learn to ignore the little
things that annoy you. I promise you,

122
00:07:50,010 --> 00:07:50,320
yeah,

123
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:54,160
that there are enough things in
life that can go wrong. Big things,

124
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,980
important things that
you'll have to worry about.

125
00:07:57,040 --> 00:07:59,890
So don't let these
little things bother you.

126
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,480
Just accept them and shake them off.

127
00:08:05,560 --> 00:08:06,910
Think about something else

128
00:08:08,680 --> 00:08:12,370
and don't focus on little
things that annoy you,

129
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:14,980
but that don't really matter.

130
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:18,910
Does that make sense to you,
Jake?

131
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:20,953
Okay.

132
00:08:20,990 --> 00:08:24,500
And I said to the captain,
yes sir. And I meant it.

133
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:30,980
I couldn't believe what the captain had
been through and I couldn't believe that

134
00:08:30,981 --> 00:08:33,290
he had this amazing attitude.

135
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:38,590
I could see in him how strong you have
to be to stay calm and not let things

136
00:08:39,411 --> 00:08:40,244
annoy you.

137
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:46,200
It made me feel like I was a giant Wimp
for letting little things bother me.

138
00:08:48,460 --> 00:08:51,760
And that was the first lesson
that I learned from the captain.

139
00:08:53,790 --> 00:08:57,180
And he taught me much,
much more over the years.

140
00:08:57,300 --> 00:09:00,810
And I'll tell you more about those
lessons later. But this first lesson,

141
00:09:00,930 --> 00:09:05,310
it was an important one.
And after that,

142
00:09:06,060 --> 00:09:09,840
when I went back to school and I
heard Jonathan Talk, talk, talk,

143
00:09:10,020 --> 00:09:13,710
talking in his annoying voice high,
just let it go.

144
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:20,410
It wasn't a big deal anymore and I
was strong enough to deal with it.

145
00:09:22,870 --> 00:09:26,740
And that's the lesson I learned.
I learned it from Jonathan,

146
00:09:27,130 --> 00:09:30,610
but more I learned it from the captain.
And to this day,

147
00:09:30,790 --> 00:09:32,260
even as a grown man,

148
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:37,290
all these years later when some little
thing is bothering me or annoying me,

149
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:42,520
I think of how much worse things could be.

150
00:09:43,900 --> 00:09:47,110
And I just ignore that little thing.
And even if I can't ignore it,

151
00:09:47,860 --> 00:09:49,540
I just keep my thoughts to myself.

152
00:09:49,630 --> 00:09:54,630
I keep it inside and I put a smile on my
face and I worry about bigger things in

153
00:09:55,421 --> 00:09:58,220
the world.
And you know what?

154
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:03,230
When you act like things don't bother you,
eventually they don't.

155
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:09,440
So be strong and don't let
little things annoy you.
