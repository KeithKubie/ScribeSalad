1
00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:01,420
Yeah.
Now what,

2
00:00:01,421 --> 00:00:06,421
what's the deal with marijuana in
the [inaudible] MMA much legal now?

3
00:00:06,880 --> 00:00:11,790
Um, the, they don't in season, out of
season. Yeah. It's fine. They just, they,

4
00:00:11,930 --> 00:00:13,860
they've lowered the um,

5
00:00:14,230 --> 00:00:18,280
acceptable level or the they've raised
it rather like what you could have in

6
00:00:18,281 --> 00:00:21,630
your bloodstream. You basically just
can't be high the day. Yeah. Yeah.

7
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,880
And that's another interesting one.
I mean that acts,

8
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:28,350
especially THC acts on a lot of these
mtor pathways, you know, that's,

9
00:00:28,351 --> 00:00:30,600
that's the same thing with a lot of
these anti aging compounds, right?

10
00:00:30,601 --> 00:00:32,340
Like wrap a myosin or you know,

11
00:00:32,510 --> 00:00:37,360
metformin to a lesser extent acts on
that mtor pathway and inhibits it. Right.

12
00:00:37,470 --> 00:00:38,130
But again,
it's,

13
00:00:38,130 --> 00:00:42,390
it's short term with something
like marijuana and you
also get this pain killing

14
00:00:42,391 --> 00:00:43,560
effect.
And there was,

15
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:49,380
I forget if this was a study or if it was,
if it was like anecdotal,

16
00:00:49,381 --> 00:00:52,260
but it's almost like a
higher thrill seeking effect.

17
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,320
Like the endocannabinoid system when
stimulated shuts down some of your,

18
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:02,850
your, your sense of fear when it comes
to experiencing a new adventure. Really.

19
00:01:02,851 --> 00:01:06,720
And so you actually,
you actually go adventure seeking more.

20
00:01:06,721 --> 00:01:11,520
And when you look at like ultra runners,
um, anybody who's competing in a,

21
00:01:11,590 --> 00:01:12,630
a non,

22
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:17,340
a complex activity in which they might
have already developed the ability to be

23
00:01:17,341 --> 00:01:18,960
able to be in the zone,
right?

24
00:01:18,961 --> 00:01:22,320
They've put in their 10,000 hours of
practice and they're able to just kind of

25
00:01:22,321 --> 00:01:24,360
check out and go into automatic mode.

26
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:28,980
When you combine that with the pain
qualling effects of something like uh,

27
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:29,520
you know,

28
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:34,200
in most cases like a THC CBD Combo is
what a lot of ultra runners are using.

29
00:01:34,201 --> 00:01:37,650
I'm not sure what what they'd use in,
in MMA right now,

30
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:40,470
but ultimately you get a good effect.
But,

31
00:01:40,471 --> 00:01:44,220
but the loss of reaction time and the
loss of the ability to be able to perform

32
00:01:44,221 --> 00:01:45,450
complex tasks,

33
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:50,550
which they proven like flight simulation
studies dictates that it's still not

34
00:01:50,551 --> 00:01:54,150
that great of a drug if you are going to
be doing complex tasks. Question though,

35
00:01:54,151 --> 00:01:56,620
when they're talking
about reacts and Studies,

36
00:01:56,870 --> 00:02:00,600
are they talking about reactions studies
for people that are acclimated to

37
00:02:00,601 --> 00:02:04,200
taking marijuana? Are they talking
about it with people where they take a,

38
00:02:04,201 --> 00:02:07,800
someone who's a sober person and they
introduce him to marijuana and there's

39
00:02:07,801 --> 00:02:11,640
this overwhelming effect of it because
one of the things that happens to people

40
00:02:11,641 --> 00:02:16,170
that aren't accustomed to THC is the
freak out effect where they're just like,

41
00:02:16,171 --> 00:02:19,440
oh, they're not comfortable with
the experience. After a while,

42
00:02:19,441 --> 00:02:21,780
the way it's described,
and again this is all anecdotal,

43
00:02:21,781 --> 00:02:23,850
but by people that are accustomed to it,

44
00:02:23,851 --> 00:02:28,851
they say you just get good at being
high and see the reaction time thing.

45
00:02:29,401 --> 00:02:32,250
I don't buy,
because a lot of strikers,

46
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:37,230
a lot of a kickboxers they train
while they're on marijuana.

47
00:02:37,231 --> 00:02:38,160
It's very common.

48
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,300
A lot of in reaction time was
done on pilots and there's,

49
00:02:42,430 --> 00:02:46,430
there's a few more blinky lights in
the cockpit than, than a mat. So sure,

50
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:49,930
that might been more going on for sure.
But, but that's the, the question is,

51
00:02:49,931 --> 00:02:54,070
are they experienced stoners or people
that are freaking out and maybe the

52
00:02:54,071 --> 00:02:56,650
reaction time is they're spacing out
and they don't know what the fuck this

53
00:02:56,651 --> 00:03:00,850
experience is like. And there they
might have because of it. You know,

54
00:03:00,851 --> 00:03:01,900
there's a lot of uh,

55
00:03:01,960 --> 00:03:06,310
really overwhelming sensations that come
with that marijuana high and a lot of

56
00:03:06,311 --> 00:03:06,820
them,
you know,

57
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:11,820
you call paranoia or over sensitivity
and sometimes you get paralysis by

58
00:03:12,401 --> 00:03:15,880
analysis when you're under the influence
of those things where all the acute

59
00:03:15,881 --> 00:03:19,180
versus chronic effect.
But you Jitsu personally,

60
00:03:19,181 --> 00:03:21,430
my personal experience would
you do to in marijuana is,

61
00:03:21,431 --> 00:03:25,180
it's an enhancer and I've argued this
that I think it's a performance enhancing

62
00:03:25,181 --> 00:03:29,470
with, with CBD CBD, no,
just marijuana. That's what,

63
00:03:29,471 --> 00:03:31,820
that's what a lot of endurance
athletes are. You know, like,

64
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,620
like folks in the ultra running community
and now like they'll use like a trace

65
00:03:35,621 --> 00:03:37,180
amount of THC combined with CBD,

66
00:03:37,181 --> 00:03:41,500
like four to one to attend to one CBD
to THC ratio. And I think, you know,

67
00:03:41,501 --> 00:03:43,510
now with the farm bill
and increasingly gallery,

68
00:03:43,511 --> 00:03:48,280
I think this idea of developing sports
performance supplements for athletes who

69
00:03:48,281 --> 00:03:49,360
aren't competing in sports,

70
00:03:49,361 --> 00:03:53,920
whether that is band are going to be
steered in the direction of like high CBD.

71
00:03:53,921 --> 00:03:58,810
And then some of these other novel
molecules are like CBG or CBN. These,

72
00:03:58,860 --> 00:03:59,560
what are those? Yeah, there's,

73
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:03,400
there's all these different I that
but not just turpines. Yes, CBG,

74
00:04:03,401 --> 00:04:04,720
CBN or cannabinoids.

75
00:04:04,960 --> 00:04:09,310
THC eight is an anti inflammatory
that's totally different than THC nine

76
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:13,550
[inaudible] he's from orally ingesting
in are from smoking it or vaporizing.

77
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:17,830
They actually are now isolating these in
labs almost like organic chemistry and

78
00:04:17,831 --> 00:04:18,321
you,
you,

79
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:23,321
you can take hemp or marijuana and
and you can actually isolate specific

80
00:04:23,681 --> 00:04:25,390
compounds and then combine them.

81
00:04:25,390 --> 00:04:29,440
So you can take like you
could take like CBG CBD,

82
00:04:29,441 --> 00:04:31,810
combine that with other
terpenes from like whatever.

83
00:04:31,811 --> 00:04:36,220
Let's say lavender and Valerian
and camomile and make like a,

84
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:39,520
like a es de stress
relaxation type of compound.

85
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:41,410
Or You could do like a,

86
00:04:41,470 --> 00:04:45,910
like a THC but a the eight instead of
a THC nine and combine that with like

87
00:04:46,180 --> 00:04:47,680
cinnamon and peppermint.

88
00:04:47,681 --> 00:04:51,190
Maybe some caffeine or creatine or
something like that to make like more of a

89
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:54,070
pick me up type of compound.
But I think that's,

90
00:04:54,190 --> 00:04:56,950
that's the wave of the future
when it comes to a lot of these,

91
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,930
these marijuana companies that are
developing stuff for specific goals.

92
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:05,440
I know a lot of folks that are trying
to CBD that use it for inflammation,

93
00:05:05,441 --> 00:05:07,990
especially athletes like it
with a little bit of Thc,

94
00:05:07,991 --> 00:05:10,150
they seem to think it's more effective.
You know,

95
00:05:10,151 --> 00:05:15,040
there's some sort of a combined effect
of the THC with the CVD. Yeah. Yeah.

96
00:05:15,041 --> 00:05:18,010
They call that the a, the
entourage effect, you know,

97
00:05:18,011 --> 00:05:20,700
when you have all the different
turpines and the endocannabinoids,

98
00:05:20,740 --> 00:05:25,450
which one's turtle? Yeah. Which
one's the turtle has no clue. So, um,

99
00:05:25,570 --> 00:05:28,570
there's hundreds of different,
different cannabinoids, right?

100
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,080
I don't think there's hundreds. Well,
I think there's at least dozens.

101
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:35,230
I don't know about hundreds. How
many of them, I mean, if you,

102
00:05:35,231 --> 00:05:38,680
if you look at a chart of the different
endocannabinoid they've actually

103
00:05:38,681 --> 00:05:43,530
discovered, if you were to just
Google on a 300 hundred 13. Yeah.

104
00:05:43,630 --> 00:05:47,140
Yeah. So it's a lot. It's a lot of
fucking could have noise. I wonder. Yeah.

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,860
I wonder if they'll be able to like
design something that gives you the high

106
00:05:50,861 --> 00:05:53,650
without the paranoia or gives you the,
you know,

107
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:57,440
the various effects without
spacing out. Yeah. Yeah.
