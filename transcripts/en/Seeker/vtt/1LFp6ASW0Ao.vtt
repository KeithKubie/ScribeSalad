00:00:00.070 --> 00:00:05.050
Homeopathy, beloved by The Royal Family and
millions around the world.

00:00:05.050 --> 00:00:08.670
But does it actually work?

00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:12.780
Hey guys Julia here for DNews

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:13.780
Homeopathy.

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:18.269
A very.. contentious form of alternative medicine
practiced by millions all over the world.

00:00:18.269 --> 00:00:22.189
The National Health Service in the UK spends
about 4 million pounds a year on these kind

00:00:22.189 --> 00:00:23.189
of treatments.

00:00:23.189 --> 00:00:26.179
And some estimates place that number as high
as 11 million pounds.

00:00:26.179 --> 00:00:28.140
So it’s more than just a fringe movement.

00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.499
In fact even the Royal Family seems to be
fans.

00:00:30.499 --> 00:00:34.420
The Queen’s Physician, Peter Fisher, recently
called for more people to use it.

00:00:34.420 --> 00:00:37.680
He says that it’s “Safe, popular with
patients, improves clinical outcomes without

00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:43.180
increasing costs, and reduces the use of potentially
hazardous drugs, including antimicrobials.”

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:46.700
Although in the US, the National Institute
of Health says that “There is little evidence

00:00:46.700 --> 00:00:50.719
to support homeopathy as an effective treatment
for any specific condition.”

00:00:50.719 --> 00:00:51.920
So what is it?

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:53.400
Homeopathy isn’t a new idea.

00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:57.769
It was introduced by the German Physician
Samuel Hahnemann over 200 years ago.

00:00:57.769 --> 00:01:01.019
Homeopathy’s premise is based on a few interesting
ideas.

00:01:01.019 --> 00:01:05.129
According to The National Center for Homeopathy,
the first idea is that “like cures like”

00:01:05.129 --> 00:01:07.610
and that’s what homeopathy means in Greek,
same suffering.

00:01:07.610 --> 00:01:12.830
Or that something that produces symptoms in
a healthy person, makes a sick person healthy.

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:17.000
So like caffeine, a molecule that keeps people
awake, might be used to treat people with

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000
insomnia.

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.520
But only if caffeine is diluted to very small
amounts.

00:01:20.520 --> 00:01:22.040
And that’s the second premise.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.909
The more dilute the remedy, the more potent
it is.

00:01:24.909 --> 00:01:27.790
And thirdly, that the illness is specific
to the person.

00:01:27.790 --> 00:01:30.600
Homeopaths take into account a holistic view
of a person.

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.880
So how is the medicine made?

00:01:31.880 --> 00:01:34.580
Well let’s go back to that caffeine example.

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:37.390
A bit of caffeine goes through the process
of 'potentization’ which involves dilution

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:42.130
and succussion (vigorous shaking), so all
the toxic effects of the extract or compound

00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:43.130
are removed.

00:01:43.130 --> 00:01:45.909
And when I say dilution, I mean a lot of dilution.

00:01:45.909 --> 00:01:50.680
Something might be diluted 1 in a hundred
30 times in a solution of water or sugar.

00:01:50.680 --> 00:01:53.490
Medicine doses are based on the centesimal
or C scale.

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:58.090
A 2C dilution requires a substance to be diluted
to one part in one hundred, and then some

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:01.310
of that mixture being diluted AGAIN to one
part in a hundred.

00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:05.409
So basically you wind up with one part of
the original substance in 10,000 parts of

00:02:05.409 --> 00:02:06.590
the solution.

00:02:06.590 --> 00:02:07.900
And so on and so forth.

00:02:07.900 --> 00:02:09.820
This process can be repeated.

00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:13.700
Basically the plant or animal extract is so
diluted that there’s almost no molecules

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:14.700
of it left.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:19.030
But according to homeopathic theory the more
diluted it is, the more “potency” it has.

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:21.390
Homeopaths believe that water retains the
“memory” of that extract.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:25.610
The idea is that after each dilution the extract
and water, sugar, or what ever the dilution

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.530
is, goes through succussion, which activates
the “vital energy” of the extract.

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.750
Alright so that’s the process… but what
does the science say about it?

00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.020
Well one study published in the journal Rheumatology
found that homeopathy helped arthritis patients

00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:41.350
over the course of six months, when added
alongside conventional medicine.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.770
Buuuuuuut it was because of “its unique
consultation process,".

00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:47.140
Basically homeopathy treats the patient, not
just the symptoms.

00:02:47.140 --> 00:02:51.530
So it was really the one on one, patient focused
appointments that helped, not the homeopathic

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.530
medicine.

00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.780
Well the National Health and Medical Research
Council of Australia found “no evidence”

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:57.040
that homeopathy is effective.

00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.240
In a report published last year, the NHMRC
looked at 57 systematic reviews of the treatment.

00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:06.210
They found there were no health conditions
for which homeopathy was effective, that no

00:03:06.210 --> 00:03:09.610
good large scale studies found that homeopathy
was better than placebo.

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:13.760
And Edzard Ernst, emeritus professor, at the
University of Exeter wrote in an opposing

00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:17.810
letter to the Queen’s physician, that homeopathy
is “implausible” and that it “flies

00:03:17.810 --> 00:03:19.230
in the face of science”.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:21.610
So it looks like science isn’t on the side
of homeopathy.

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:40.970
But you know what science 

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:44.260
DOES support?

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:47.470
Meditation.
