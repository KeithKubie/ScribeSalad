00:00:00.625 --> 00:00:04.000
You’re in a part of town
you used to live in as a teenager.

00:00:04.042 --> 00:00:08.000
You walk past the house of the girlfriend
you knew when you were 16.

00:00:08.001 --> 00:00:10.726
You look up to what used to be
her bedroom window.

00:00:10.750 --> 00:00:13.934
From the outside,
everything still looks the same

00:00:13.958 --> 00:00:16.143
though somebody else lives there now.

00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.959
Her parents are retired, she’s married
with two small kids in another city.

00:00:20.583 --> 00:00:25.291
You feel a searing nostalgia for
everything that was and no longer is.

00:00:25.917 --> 00:00:27.813
It’s not so much her you miss,

00:00:27.833 --> 00:00:31.893
more what you had, who you both were,
how things looked then.

00:00:31.917 --> 00:00:36.583
It’s hard to explain what the feeling is,
though it is confounding in its intensity.

00:00:37.333 --> 00:00:39.270
At that moment, your phone rings.

00:00:39.292 --> 00:00:41.684
It’s a friend – who asks how you are.

00:00:41.708 --> 00:00:45.268
You’re at a loss, you don’t quite
know how to convey your emotions

00:00:45.292 --> 00:00:48.917
and after a few attempts,
move on to other subjects.

00:00:49.417 --> 00:00:52.476
Unless – that is – you speak Portuguese,

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.476
because if you do,
there will be no need to struggle.

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:58.893
You will have the ideal word
immediately to hand.

00:00:58.917 --> 00:01:02.976
You will simply tell your friend
that you are experiencing ‘saudade’

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.615
and they will understand.

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:08.643
The word, which has no direct translation
in any other language,

00:01:08.667 --> 00:01:13.976
means a bitter-sweet melancholic yearning
for something beautiful that is now gone:

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.792
a love affair, a childhood home,
a friendship.

00:01:17.333 --> 00:01:22.583
It’s a blend of pain at loss and pleasure
that loveliness once graced our lives.

00:01:23.333 --> 00:01:24.707
The underlying issue,

00:01:24.708 --> 00:01:27.583
the relationship between
language and feeling,

00:01:27.648 --> 00:01:29.976
has long created debate in philosophy.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.393
Some thinkers have proposed that
feelings are independent of words:

00:01:34.417 --> 00:01:36.643
babies, for example, can feel things

00:01:36.667 --> 00:01:39.500
long before they know how to
pin words to their sensations.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.851
But other philosophers have insisted
that certain feelings

00:01:42.875 --> 00:01:45.351
would remain essentially unknown to us

00:01:45.375 --> 00:01:48.333
if we didn’t have the words
to help us recognise them.

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000
The truth – as so often – lies somewhere
in an intriguing middle zone.

00:01:53.542 --> 00:01:56.293
Language may not wholly create feelings,

00:01:56.317 --> 00:02:00.263
but it most definitely and beautifully
deepens and clarifies them.

00:02:00.792 --> 00:02:03.893
The right words help us to know ourselves;

00:02:03.917 --> 00:02:05.184
through their agency,

00:02:05.208 --> 00:02:10.041
we can more accurately and securely
identify the contents of our inner lives.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:13.268
The phenomenon becomes
particularly apparent

00:02:13.292 --> 00:02:16.018
whenever we come across words
in other languages

00:02:16.042 --> 00:02:20.834
that zero in on a feeling that our own
language doesn’t have a succinct term for.

00:02:21.542 --> 00:02:26.584
We notice then just how much a good word
can do to bring an emotion into focus.

00:02:27.333 --> 00:02:30.184
Take, for example, the Turkish word HÜZÜN,

00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:33.893
which refers to the gloomy feeling
that things are in decline

00:02:33.917 --> 00:02:39.143
and that the situation – often political
in nature – will probably only get worse,

00:02:39.167 --> 00:02:43.209
typically because of the folly and
grandiosity of corrupt political leaders.

00:02:43.833 --> 00:02:47.684
How useful to have such a word to
indicate, and commune with,

00:02:47.708 --> 00:02:50.583
the depths of grief unfolding
in the Turkish soul.

00:02:51.083 --> 00:02:54.434
Or, more cheerily, up in Norway
they have FORELSKET,

00:02:54.458 --> 00:02:57.893
a word that captures the euphoric feeling
at the beginning of love,

00:02:57.917 --> 00:03:00.101
when we can’t believe someone so perfect

00:03:00.125 --> 00:03:03.708
could have wandered into our lives
and has the goodness to think well of us.

00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:09.476
We might report: ‘I was overpowered
by forelsket as our fingers enlaced…’

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:14.083
But it isn’t just a few magical words from
foreign languages that clarify our minds.

00:03:14.667 --> 00:03:17.485
This is what all great literature may do.

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.018
What we call a ‘good’ poem or novel

00:03:20.042 --> 00:03:22.101
is ultimately one that reduces

00:03:22.125 --> 00:03:25.851
the extent of our own
self-alienation and misunderstanding,

00:03:25.875 --> 00:03:27.708
and returns us to ourselves.

00:03:28.375 --> 00:03:30.434
After a lifetime of reading,

00:03:30.458 --> 00:03:33.184
we might know how to
pin words and sentences

00:03:33.208 --> 00:03:35.268
to pretty much everything we feel,

00:03:35.292 --> 00:03:37.917
however ephemeral and fragile it might be.

00:03:38.958 --> 00:03:42.833
It was this gift that Shakespeare praised
in A Midsummer Night’s Dream

00:03:42.876 --> 00:03:44.018
when he wrote that:

00:03:44.042 --> 00:03:47.184
The poet’s eye, in fine frenzy rolling,

00:03:47.208 --> 00:03:50.851
Doth glance from heaven to earth,
from earth to heaven;

00:03:50.875 --> 00:03:53.059
And as imagination bodies forth

00:03:53.083 --> 00:03:56.559
The forms of things unknown, the poet’s pen

00:03:56.583 --> 00:04:00.184
Turns them to shapes and
gives to airy nothing

00:04:00.208 --> 00:04:02.542
A local habitation and a name.

00:04:03.458 --> 00:04:07.643
Thanks to literature, we can be
rescued from the closed diving-bells

00:04:07.667 --> 00:04:09.625
we are otherwise locked into.

00:04:09.667 --> 00:04:12.559
The right words break our isolation.

00:04:12.583 --> 00:04:16.625
They are the agents of,
and conduits to, love.
