00:00:00.130 --> 00:00:07.020
Haha just kidding, I just wanted to freak
some of you out.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.179
So I’ve been wearing contacts for nearly
ten years now.

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:17.320
And have always wondered, is touching my eye
every day doing something bad to my eyes?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:21.789
Apparently putting contacts in your eye is
“not a neutral act” according to microbiologist

00:00:21.789 --> 00:00:23.609
Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello.

00:00:23.609 --> 00:00:27.250
In fact, contacts might just change more than
your vision.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.489
Dominguez-Bello and other researchers from
NYU’s Langone Medical center found significant

00:00:31.489 --> 00:00:35.820
differences in the ecosystems of the eyes
of people who wear contact lenses and those

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:36.930
who don’t.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:40.650
In their study, they took hundreds of swabs
of people’s eye conjunctiva, which lines

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:44.920
the eyelids and covers the white part of your
eyes, and swabs of the skin directly under

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:45.920
the eye.

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:48.740
They found thousands of different strains
in the different parts of the eye.

00:00:48.740 --> 00:00:53.190
But in those people who wore contacts, they
had more bacterial diversity in the skin beneath

00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:57.470
their eye and a higher amount of different
kinds of bacteria on the surface of the eye

00:00:57.470 --> 00:00:58.470
itself.

00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:02.280
They had three times the usual proportion
of certain bacteria like Methylobacterium,

00:01:02.280 --> 00:01:06.259
Lactobacillus, Acinetobacter, and Pseudomonas
bacteria in the eyes.

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.979
Basically, the bacteria on the surface of
their eyes looked more like the types of bacteria

00:01:09.979 --> 00:01:13.200
found on the skin beneath their eye, when
compared to those who don’t wear contacts

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:14.200
at all.

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:18.249
But the researchers still wonder if this altered
bacterial composition is because contact wearers

00:01:18.249 --> 00:01:22.280
keep touching their eyes with their dirty
little fingers or if it’s the lens itself

00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:24.289
that is changing the immune system of the
eye.

00:01:24.289 --> 00:01:26.280
So more research is needed.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.810
However, the researchers think this could
be part of the reason contact wearers get

00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:31.450
more frequent eye infections.

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:37.700
Since the 1970s when soft lenses came on the
scene, corneal ulcers have been on the rise.

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:40.749
Corneal ulcers leave a nasty open sore on
the cornea.

00:01:40.749 --> 00:01:44.829
They’re caused by bacterial, fungal or viral
infections, mostly Pseudomonas.

00:01:44.829 --> 00:01:50.049
Since that type of bacteria is found on the
skin, eyelid and hand hygiene might be to

00:01:50.049 --> 00:01:51.049
blame.

00:01:51.049 --> 00:01:55.649
Specifically, another study published in Optometry
and Vision Science identified three specific

00:01:55.649 --> 00:01:58.429
behaviors that might lead to nasty infections.

00:01:58.429 --> 00:02:01.369
And they’re pretty straight foward
like not washing hands with soap and water

00:02:01.369 --> 00:02:05.849
before handling contacts, not letting the
case air-dry, surprisingly and i’m a little

00:02:05.849 --> 00:02:10.331
skeptical on this point, using a contact case
and a solution from different manufacturers.

00:02:10.331 --> 00:02:15.170
I mean some bottles of solution come with
cases, but I just assumed they were being

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:19.090
nice, and all that “please use our solution
for the best results or whatever” was just

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:20.090
marketing BS.

00:02:20.090 --> 00:02:21.090
But maybe not?

00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:26.760
Or if you’re too lazy to do any of that,
you could try contacts coated with anti-microbial

00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:28.200
stuff.

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:31.980
One study also published in the journal Optometry
and Vision Science tested a type of contact

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:33.370
coated with melamine.

00:02:33.370 --> 00:02:36.170
This peptide fights microbes by inhibiting
their growth.

00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:40.800
In this study, human volunteers wore these
coated contacts for a day with no major side-effects

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.940
and they were just as comfortable as regular
lenses.

00:02:42.940 --> 00:02:45.010
So that could be handy to have.

00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.870
And I know I know, it sounds scary that YOU
HAVE BACTERIA IN YOUR EYE.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:53.010
But bacteria is everywhere in and on us, we’re
like a walking ecosystem.

00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:57.440
And not all of it is bad, our microbiome might
be beneficial for health.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.660
But some bacteria do cause nasty infections
if they get out of hand, so if you’re worried

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.360
basically, keep your contacts clean?

00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:05.790
It shouldn’t take science for you to get
that.

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:09.180
Just get a nice routine down of washing your
hands before you handle your contacts and

00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:11.010
air-drying the cases every now and then.

00:03:11.010 --> 00:03:14.520
But if shaving is part of your routine, maybe
you should wait to take your contacts out

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:15.520
AFTER you’re done with that.

00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.790
You might need to see for shaving your face
and stuff.

00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.050
