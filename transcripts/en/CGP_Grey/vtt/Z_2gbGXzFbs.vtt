00:00:01.670 --> 00:00:04.009
Pluto: Planet or not?

00:00:04.009 --> 00:00:07.090
Before we can answer this question we need
to know what the word planet is for, and that

00:00:07.090 --> 00:00:10.851
takes us back to the ancient greeks who called
Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, the

00:00:10.851 --> 00:00:13.170
Moon and sun planets.

00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:16.930
Basically if it moved across the sky and was
bright, it was a planet.

00:00:16.930 --> 00:00:21.090
This is a terrible start for the word because,
1) it excludes Earth from the list and 2)

00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:23.680
it groups wildly different things together.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:26.699
But the greeks couldn't know how different
the Moon was from Saturn, because the best

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.600
technology they had to observe the Universe
was sadly limited.

00:00:29.600 --> 00:00:33.430
It would take several thousand years until
the industrious Dutch made the first telescopes

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:36.239
and astronomy became much more interesting.

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.109
Astronomers could now confidently rearrange
the solar system -- an elegant scientific

00:00:39.109 --> 00:00:43.260
advance that no one could possibly object
to -- and reclassify its parts, dropping the

00:00:43.260 --> 00:00:45.889
Sun and moon from the list of planets and
adding Earth.

00:00:45.889 --> 00:00:48.729
Now, if it orbited the Sun, it was a planet.

00:00:48.729 --> 00:00:52.010
As time went on and telescopes got better
and better each new century brought with it

00:00:52.010 --> 00:00:53.649
the discovery of a new planet.

00:00:53.649 --> 00:00:57.640
Which brings us to this familiar solar system:
nine planets orbiting one star.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:01.319
And looking at this model makes people wonder,
why do astronomers want to ditch Pluto?

00:01:01.319 --> 00:01:03.940
The problem is pictures like this in textbooks
are lies.

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:06.380
Well, not lies exactly, but unhelpful.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:09.890
They give the impression that the planets
are similar-ash in size and evenly-ish spaced,

00:01:09.890 --> 00:01:11.920
but the reality couldn't be more different.

00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:16.270
Here, dear Terrans, is our home planet Earth,
and this is Jupiter next to it at the correct

00:01:16.270 --> 00:01:19.020
scale -- rather bigger than you probably thought.

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:22.329
If we take this diagram and adjust for the
correct sizes of the planets it looks like

00:01:22.329 --> 00:01:23.329
this.

00:01:23.329 --> 00:01:26.659
Unless you're watching the video in fullscreen
HD mode, you might not even be able to see

00:01:26.659 --> 00:01:27.659
Pluto.

00:01:27.659 --> 00:01:30.990
So size differences are vast, and Pluto is
the smallest by far.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:35.640
But it's not just small for a planet, it's
also smaller than seven moons: Triton, Europa,

00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.180
our own Moon, Io, Callisto, Titan, and Ganymede.

00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:41.470
Even if you show the correct relative sizes
the distances are still a problem.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:44.399
Think about it, if Jupiter was this close
to Earth it wouldn't look like a dot in the

00:01:44.399 --> 00:01:49.039
night's sky but would be rather overwhelming
-- so it must be really far away, which makes

00:01:49.039 --> 00:01:51.159
drawing it to scale rather a challenge.

00:01:51.159 --> 00:01:54.299
If you want the length of a piece of paper
to represent the distance from Mercury to

00:01:54.299 --> 00:01:59.579
Pluto, then giant Jupiter would be the size
of a dust mite on that page, and Pluto a bacterium.

00:01:59.579 --> 00:02:03.560
But excluding Pluto from the plant club just
for being tiny and far away isn't reason enough

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:05.659
and quickly brings out the Pluto defenders.

00:02:05.659 --> 00:02:09.470
In order to understand what Pluto really is,
we need to first discuss a planet you've never

00:02:09.470 --> 00:02:11.060
heard of: Ceres.

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:15.120
Back in the 1801, astronomers found a new
planet in the huge gap between Mars and Jupiter

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.590
-- it was a small planet, but they loved it
anyway and named it Ceres.

00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:22.530
The next year astronomers found another small
planet in the same area and named it Pallas.

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:27.239
A few years later they found a third one,
Juno, and then, funnily enough, a fourth one,

00:02:27.239 --> 00:02:28.239
Vesta.

00:02:28.239 --> 00:02:31.030
And for a several decades children learned
the 11 planets of the solar system.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.300
But, astronomers kept finding more and more
of these objects and became increasingly uncomfortable

00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:39.450
calling them planets because they were much
more like each other than planets the on either

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:43.760
side, so a new category was born: asteroids
in the asteroid belt -- and the tiny planets

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.409
were relabeled which is why you've never heard
of them.

00:02:46.409 --> 00:02:51.010
And it was a good decision too, as astronomers
have now found hundreds of thousands of asteroids,

00:02:51.010 --> 00:02:54.830
which would be a lot for a kid to memorize
if they were all still planets.

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:55.830
Back to Pluto.

00:02:55.830 --> 00:02:58.889
It was discovered in 1930 making it the 9th
planet.

00:02:58.889 --> 00:03:02.370
First estimates put Pluto about the size of
Neptune, but with more observations that was

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:05.630
revised down, and down and down.

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:09.099
While Pluto shrank astronomers started to
find other, similar objects orbiting in the

00:03:09.099 --> 00:03:10.129
same zone.

00:03:10.129 --> 00:03:11.320
Sound familiar?

00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.710
While school kids kept memorizing the nine
planets, some astronomers grew uneasy about

00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:18.220
including Pluto because the size estimates
continued to shrink, they learned that Pluto

00:03:18.220 --> 00:03:23.129
is made mostly ice, and they continued to
find lots and lots of icy objects at the edge

00:03:23.129 --> 00:03:25.299
of the solar system just like Pluto.

00:03:25.299 --> 00:03:29.390
This problem could be ignored as long as no
one found an ice ball bigger than Pluto, which

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:33.130
is exactly what happened in 2006 with the
discovery of Eris.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:36.880
Once again, astronomers recategorized the
solar system and grouped these distant objects,

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:40.430
including Pluto, into a new area called Kuiper
belt.

00:03:40.430 --> 00:03:44.860
And that's the story of Pluto -- a miscategorized
planted that finally found its home -- just

00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:46.100
like Ceres.

00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:49.500
But this story is really less about Pluto
than it is about realizing the word 'planet'

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:50.909
isn't very helpful.

00:03:50.909 --> 00:03:54.019
The first four planets are nothing at all
like the next four, so it's even a little

00:03:54.019 --> 00:03:57.739
weird to group these eight together which
is why they often aren't and are separated

00:03:57.739 --> 00:03:59.870
into terrestrial planets and gas giants.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.100
And now that we have telescopes that can see
planets around stars not our own, and we've

00:04:03.100 --> 00:04:06.989
found rogue planets drifting in empty space
and brown dwarfs -- objects that blur the

00:04:06.989 --> 00:04:11.129
very line between planet and star -- the word
planet becomes even less clear.

00:04:11.129 --> 00:04:14.760
So as we increase our knowledge of the Universe
the category of 'planet' will probably continue

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:17.650
to evolve, or possibly, fall out of favor
entirely.

00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:22.070
But, for the time being the best way to categorize
the stuff in our solar system is into one

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:26.820
star, eight planets, four terrestrial, four
gas giants, the asteroid belt, and the distant

00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.480
Kuiper belt, home to Plutoï¿½
