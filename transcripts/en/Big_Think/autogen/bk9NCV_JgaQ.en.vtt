critical and we built a virtual team

00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:45.960
critical and we built a virtual team
 

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.770

so the internet was was absolutely
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.090
so the internet was was absolutely
critical otherwise I would have had to

00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:02.100
critical otherwise I would have had to
 

00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:04.250
critical otherwise I would have had to
stay here and we also never had an

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.260
stay here and we also never had an
 

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:11.149
stay here and we also never had an
office so well I think it's been a

00:01:11.149 --> 00:01:11.159
office so well I think it's been a
 

00:01:11.159 --> 00:01:14.289
office so well I think it's been a
really radical change its moved from

00:01:14.289 --> 00:01:14.299

easily with a virtual team of people so
 

00:01:29.189 --> 00:01:31.370
easily with a virtual team of people so
it's it's transformed it's made a lot

00:01:31.370 --> 00:01:31.380
it's it's transformed it's made a lot
 

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:35.270
it's it's transformed it's made a lot
less expensive and it's a it's a made it

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:35.280
less expensive and it's a it's a made it
 

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.830
less expensive and it's a it's a made it
a lot more interesting I think people

00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:36.840
a lot more interesting I think people
 

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.429
a lot more interesting I think people
are realizing that they can move around

00:01:40.429 --> 00:01:40.439
are realizing that they can move around
 

00:01:40.439 --> 00:01:45.560

and enjoy they're able to work and work

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:45.570
and enjoy they're able to work and work
 

00:01:45.570 --> 00:01:49.340
and enjoy they're able to work and work
remotely often earning Western wages or

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:49.350
remotely often earning Western wages or
 

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:52.160
remotely often earning Western wages or
earning high wages and paying having low

00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:52.170
earning high wages and paying having low
 

00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:55.789
earning high wages and paying having low
low expenses or moving from the winter

00:01:55.789 --> 00:01:55.799
low expenses or moving from the winter
 

00:01:55.799 --> 00:01:58.550
low expenses or moving from the winter
to the summer and so there are a lot of

00:01:58.550 --> 00:01:58.560
to the summer and so there are a lot of
 

00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:00.800
to the summer and so there are a lot of
advantages to it also to sort of get it

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:00.810
advantages to it also to sort of get it
 

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:03.679
advantages to it also to sort of get it
getting away so I think digital nomads

00:02:03.679 --> 00:02:03.689
getting away so I think digital nomads
 

00:02:03.689 --> 00:02:05.179
getting away so I think digital nomads
are just people who take advantage of

00:02:05.179 --> 00:02:05.189
are just people who take advantage of
 

00:02:05.189 --> 00:02:08.779
are just people who take advantage of
digital technology in order to continue

00:02:08.779 --> 00:02:08.789
digital technology in order to continue
 

00:02:08.789 --> 00:02:11.510
digital technology in order to continue
to do their work but in a location that

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:11.520
to do their work but in a location that
 

00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:13.370
to do their work but in a location that
might be better for

00:02:13.370 --> 00:02:13.380
might be better for
 

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:15.890
might be better for
financial reasons or temperature reasons

00:02:15.890 --> 00:02:15.900
financial reasons or temperature reasons
 

00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:18.350
financial reasons or temperature reasons

family or friends well I think they're
 

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.680
family or friends well I think they're
probably two big areas that it's changed

00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:27.690
probably two big areas that it's changed
 

00:02:27.690 --> 00:02:31.730
probably two big areas that it's changed
one is just on demand software so sort

00:02:31.730 --> 00:02:31.740
one is just on demand software so sort
 

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:34.040
one is just on demand software so sort
of the google docs etc of the world i

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:34.050
of the google docs etc of the world i
 

00:02:34.050 --> 00:02:35.450

think that like was computing in the

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:35.460
think that like was computing in the
 

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:38.630

cloud I i love it I think it's I think

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:38.640
cloud I i love it I think it's I think
 

00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:42.010
cloud I i love it I think it's I think
it's amazing that I've installed

00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:42.020
it's amazing that I've installed
 

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:45.350
it's amazing that I've installed
reinstalled uninstalled way too much

00:02:45.350 --> 00:02:45.360
reinstalled uninstalled way too much
 

00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:48.350
reinstalled uninstalled way too much
software and so I really love the

00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:48.360
software and so I really love the
 

00:02:48.360 --> 00:02:51.140
software and so I really love the
simplicity of cloud cloud computing and

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:51.150
simplicity of cloud cloud computing and
 

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:54.740
simplicity of cloud cloud computing and
Google Docs and and and gmail and any

00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:54.750
Google Docs and and and gmail and any
 

00:02:54.750 --> 00:02:56.690

sort of sort of online software that I

00:02:56.690 --> 00:02:56.700
sort of sort of online software that I
 

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.920
sort of sort of online software that I
don't have to install on my computer

00:02:57.920 --> 00:02:57.930
don't have to install on my computer
 

00:02:57.930 --> 00:02:59.450
don't have to install on my computer
that I can access from anywhere around

00:02:59.450 --> 00:02:59.460
that I can access from anywhere around
 

00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:02.210
that I can access from anywhere around
the world I say that's a big one the

00:03:02.210 --> 00:03:02.220
the world I say that's a big one the
 

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.950
the world I say that's a big one the
other one that's really changed is

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:03.960
other one that's really changed is
 

00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.200
other one that's really changed is
communication so skype and skype is a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210
communication so skype and skype is a
 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:12.620
communication so skype and skype is a
big one both and other just instant

00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:12.630
big one both and other just instant
 

00:03:12.630 --> 00:03:14.420
big one both and other just instant
messaging platforms i think that's

00:03:14.420 --> 00:03:14.430
messaging platforms i think that's
 

00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:17.600
messaging platforms i think that's
really huge and voice over IP and and

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:17.610
really huge and voice over IP and and
 

00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:22.040
really huge and voice over IP and and
video that's really transform things may

00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:22.050
video that's really transform things may
 

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:23.600
video that's really transform things may
it's made it very easy and inexpensive

00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:23.610
it's made it very easy and inexpensive
 

00:03:23.610 --> 00:03:26.540
it's made it very easy and inexpensive
to communicate with the big team from

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:26.550
to communicate with the big team from
 

00:03:26.550 --> 00:03:28.880
to communicate with the big team from
around the world and so I'd say that's a

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:28.890
around the world and so I'd say that's a
 

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.650
around the world and so I'd say that's a
really that's a really big one and then

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:30.660
really that's a really big one and then
 

00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:34.430
really that's a really big one and then
mobile phones that do email and instant

00:03:34.430 --> 00:03:34.440
mobile phones that do email and instant
 

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:37.460
mobile phones that do email and instant
messaging and and all that also really

00:03:37.460 --> 00:03:37.470
messaging and and all that also really
 

00:03:37.470 --> 00:03:39.170
messaging and and all that also really
transform things they made it so that

00:03:39.170 --> 00:03:39.180
transform things they made it so that
 

00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:41.660
transform things they made it so that
you can get away with having this tiny

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:41.670
you can get away with having this tiny
 

00:03:41.670 --> 00:03:43.220
you can get away with having this tiny
little thing in your pocket for the most

00:03:43.220 --> 00:03:43.230
