00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:14.256
"You don't belong here"

00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:17.760
almost always means, "We can't find
a function or a role for you."

00:00:18.865 --> 00:00:23.240
"You don't belong here" sometimes means,
"You're too queer to handle."

00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
"You don't belong here"

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:29.056
very rarely means,

00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.640
"There's no way for you to exist
and be happy here."

00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:36.336
I went to university
in Johannesburg, South Africa,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.789
and I remember the first time
a white friend of mine

00:00:38.813 --> 00:00:42.413
heard me speaking Setswana,
the national language of Botswana.

00:00:43.240 --> 00:00:44.896
I was on the phone with my mother

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:50.336
and the intrigue which painted itself
across her face was absolutely priceless.

00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.016
As soon as I hung up,
she comes to me and says,

00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.656
"I didn't know you could do that.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:58.360
After all these years of knowing you,
how did I not know you could do that?"

00:00:59.280 --> 00:01:02.696
What she was referring to was the fact
that I could switch off the twang

00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:04.176
and slip into a native tongue,

00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.536
and so I chose to let her in
on a few other things

00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.520
which locate me as a Motswana,

00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.976
not just by virtue of the fact
that I speak a language

00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:14.616
or I have family there,

00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:19.696
but that a rural child lives
within this shiny visage of fabulosity.

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:22.456
(Laughter)

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:26.496
(Applause)

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.736
I invited the Motswana public
into the story, my story,

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:33.216
as a transgender person years ago,
in English of course,

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:35.816
because Setswana
is a gender-neutral language

00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:39.176
and the closest we get
is an approximation of "transgender."

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:42.896
And an important part of my history
got left out of that story,

00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:45.960
by association rather than
out of any act of shame.

00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:50.456
"Kat" was an international superstar,

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:53.736
a fashion and lifestyle writer,
a musician, theater producer

00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:55.016
and performer --

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:58.936
all the things that qualify me
to be a mainstream, whitewashed,

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:01.096
new age digestible queer.

00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:02.320
Kat.

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:06.296
Kat had a degree from one
of the best universities in Africa,

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.840
oh no, the world.

00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.576
By association, what Kat wasn't

00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:12.976
was just like the little
brown-skinned children

00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.256
frolicking through the streets
of some incidental railway settlement

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:17.776
like Tati Siding,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.015
or an off-the-grid village like Kgagodi,

00:02:21.039 --> 00:02:24.056
legs clad in dust stockings
whose knees had blackened

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:27.336
from years of kneeling
and wax-polishing floors,

00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.496
whose shins were marked
with lessons from climbing trees,

00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:33.136
who played until dusk,

00:02:33.160 --> 00:02:35.856
went in for supper by a paraffin lamp

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.256
and returned to play hide-and-seek
amongst centipedes and owls

00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:43.840
until finally someone's mother
would call the whole thing to an end.

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.136
That got lost both in translation
and in transition,

00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:50.416
and when I realized this,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.536
I decided it was time for me to start
building bridges between myselves.

00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:58.256
For me and for others to access me,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.080
I had to start indigenizing my queerness.

00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.376
What I mean by indigenizing
is stripping away the city life film

00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.336
that stops you from seeing
the villager within.

00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.736
In a time where being brown, queer,
African and seen as worthy of space

00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.776
means being everything but rural,

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:16.896
I fear that we're erasing
the very struggles

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:18.880
that got us to where we are now.

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:22.216
The very first time I queered
being out in a village,

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.216
I was in my early 20s,
and I wore a kaftan.

00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.176
I was ridiculed by some of my family
and by strangers for wearing a dress.

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.656
My defense against their comments
was the default that we who don't belong,

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.616
the ones who are better than, get taught,

00:03:37.640 --> 00:03:40.480
we shrug them off and say,
"They just don't know enough."

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.696
And of course I was wrong,
because my idea of wealth of knowledge

00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:51.920
was based in removing yourself
from Third World thinking and living.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.296
But it took time for me to realize
that my acts of pride

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:58.736
weren't most alive in
the global cities I traipsed through,

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:02.816
but in the villages where I speak
the languages and play the games

00:04:02.840 --> 00:04:04.736
and feel most at home and I can say,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:06.656
"I have seen the world,

00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:10.320
and I know that people like me
aren't alone here, we are everywhere."

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:14.496
And so I used these village homes
for self-reflection

00:04:14.520 --> 00:04:17.936
and to give hope
to the others who don't belong.

00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:19.616
Indigenizing my queerness

00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:24.000
means bridging the many
exceptional parts of myself.

00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.016
It means honoring the fact

00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.456
that my tongue can contort itself
to speak the romance languages

00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:35.696
without denying or exoticizing the fact
that when I am moved, it can do this:

00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.680
(Ululating)

00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:42.416
It means --

00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:44.096
(Cheers)

00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:48.176
(Applause)

00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:52.136
It means branding cattle with my mother
or chopping firewood with my cousins

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.576
doesn't make me
any less fabulous or queer,

00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:58.936
even though I'm now accustomed
to rooftop shindigs, wine-paired menus

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.576
and VIP lounges.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:02.456
(Laughter)

00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:07.056
It means wearing my pride
through my grandmother's tongue,

00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:09.896
my mother's food, my grandfather's song,

00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:13.296
my skin etched with stories
of falling off donkeys

00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:17.440
and years and years and years
of sleeping under a blanket of stars.

00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.136
If there's any place I don't belong,

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:26.736
it's in a mind where the story of me
starts with the branch of me being queer

00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.600
and not with my rural roots.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:32.696
Indigenizing my queerness
means understanding

00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:36.760
that the rural is a part of me,
and I am an indelible part of it.

00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:38.576
Thank you.

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.360
(Applause)
