only thing I really wanted to point out
 

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.230

is that you have to really be careful

00:09:41.230 --> 00:09:41.240
is that you have to really be careful
 

00:09:41.240 --> 00:09:43.360
is that you have to really be careful
with these kinds of games that you look

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:43.370
with these kinds of games that you look
 

00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.249
with these kinds of games that you look
at every place that the back he can be

00:09:45.249 --> 00:09:45.259
at every place that the back he can be
 

00:09:45.259 --> 00:09:48.069
at every place that the back he can be
hit so first of all we're right now in

00:09:48.069 --> 00:09:48.079
hit so first of all we're right now in
 

00:09:48.079 --> 00:09:50.079
hit so first of all we're right now in
the middle of the game and we get the

00:09:50.079 --> 00:09:50.089
the middle of the game and we get the
 

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:52.360
the middle of the game and we get the
option to quit and what did that happen

00:09:52.360 --> 00:09:52.370
option to quit and what did that happen
 

00:09:52.370 --> 00:09:53.499
option to quit and what did that happen
I mean it seems like we could have just

00:09:53.499 --> 00:09:53.509
I mean it seems like we could have just
 

00:09:53.509 --> 00:09:55.240
I mean it seems like we could have just
gone back one screen absolutely so this

00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:55.250
gone back one screen absolutely so this
 

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.639
gone back one screen absolutely so this
is an example of you know of something

00:09:57.639 --> 00:09:57.649
is an example of you know of something
 

00:09:57.649 --> 00:09:58.689
is an example of you know of something
that you know our reviewers would

00:09:58.689 --> 00:09:58.699
that you know our reviewers would
 

00:09:58.699 --> 00:10:00.850
that you know our reviewers would
actually catch now admittedly we're in

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:00.860
actually catch now admittedly we're in
 

00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:02.170
actually catch now admittedly we're in
sort of a tutorial mode so that's sort

00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:02.180
sort of a tutorial mode so that's sort
 

00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.369
sort of a tutorial mode so that's sort
of understandable but i'll show you the

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:03.379
of understandable but i'll show you the
 

00:10:03.379 --> 00:10:06.100
of understandable but i'll show you the
the big thing is if we're if we actually

00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:06.110
the big thing is if we're if we actually
 

00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:08.829
the big thing is if we're if we actually
go here we bring this up and now the

00:10:08.829 --> 00:10:08.839
go here we bring this up and now the
 

00:10:08.839 --> 00:10:10.509
go here we bring this up and now the
back key doesn't do anything anymore and

00:10:10.509 --> 00:10:10.519
back key doesn't do anything anymore and
 

00:10:10.519 --> 00:10:12.939
back key doesn't do anything anymore and
and you know so it we've gone like

00:10:12.939 --> 00:10:12.949
and you know so it we've gone like
 

00:10:12.949 --> 00:10:16.059
and you know so it we've gone like
halfway yeah and and the idea is the

00:10:16.059 --> 00:10:16.069
halfway yeah and and the idea is the
 

00:10:16.069 --> 00:10:17.559
halfway yeah and and the idea is the
back you should always do something

00:10:17.559 --> 00:10:17.569
back you should always do something
 

00:10:17.569 --> 00:10:18.879
back you should always do something
anyway I mean by do something I mean

navigate somewhere I don't mind pop up
 

00:10:20.809 --> 00:10:22.509
navigate somewhere I don't mind pop up
something that says the back key doesn't

00:10:22.509 --> 00:10:22.519
something that says the back key doesn't
 

00:10:22.519 --> 00:10:24.699

might well at least at least the user

00:10:33.019 --> 00:10:33.029
might well at least at least the user

up something are you sure you wanted an
Android device yeah exactly I mean why

00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:39.990
Android device yeah exactly I mean why
 

00:10:39.990 --> 00:10:42.199
Android device yeah exactly I mean why
is why would you ignore like one of the

00:10:42.199 --> 00:10:42.209
is why would you ignore like one of the
 

00:10:42.209 --> 00:10:44.300
is why would you ignore like one of the
most important features of Android so

00:10:44.300 --> 00:10:44.310
most important features of Android so
 

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:46.129
most important features of Android so
that's at you know the menu still there

00:10:46.129 --> 00:10:46.139
that's at you know the menu still there
 

00:10:46.139 --> 00:10:47.689
that's at you know the menu still there
but that's it's really i think more more

00:10:47.689 --> 00:10:47.699
but that's it's really i think more more
 

00:10:47.699 --> 00:10:48.920
but that's it's really i think more more
result of the fact that they're using

00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:48.930
result of the fact that they're using
 

00:10:48.930 --> 00:10:51.439
result of the fact that they're using
openfeint and open taint requires than

00:10:51.439 --> 00:10:51.449
openfeint and open taint requires than
 

00:10:51.449 --> 00:10:53.809

their api because they basically give
 

00:11:27.839 --> 00:11:29.389
their api because they basically give
you a lot of that stuff so well that

00:11:29.389 --> 00:11:29.399
you a lot of that stuff so well that
 

00:11:29.399 --> 00:11:31.009
you a lot of that stuff so well that
would make a lot of sons yeah so any

00:11:31.009 --> 00:11:31.019
would make a lot of sons yeah so any
 

00:11:31.019 --> 00:11:32.329
would make a lot of sons yeah so any
case I you know think about that when

via the track event and we use trek to

00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:10.600
via the track event and we use trek to

move around the camera so they couldn't
 

00:19:12.550 --> 00:19:15.960
move around the camera so they couldn't
click and we had to fix that to an

00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:15.970
click and we had to fix that to an
 

00:19:15.970 --> 00:19:19.320

00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:19.330
offset that's in the galaxy s it works
 

00:19:19.330 --> 00:19:23.580
offset that's in the galaxy s it works
perfectly but on htc it just didn't work

00:19:23.580 --> 00:19:23.590
perfectly but on htc it just didn't work
 

00:19:23.590 --> 00:19:25.860
perfectly but on htc it just didn't work
it was easy to fix but you have to know

00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:25.870
it was easy to fix but you have to know
 

00:19:25.870 --> 00:19:27.930
it was easy to fix but you have to know
it so that was and that was inside of

00:19:27.930 --> 00:19:27.940
it so that was and that was inside of
 

00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.910
it so that was and that was inside of
the gesture detector then that you're

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:29.920
the gesture detector then that you're
 

00:19:29.920 --> 00:19:31.080
the gesture detector then that you're
that you were saying that is that we're

00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:31.090
that you were saying that is that we're
 

00:19:31.090 --> 00:19:33.930
that you were saying that is that we're
using a that as your to determine

00:19:33.930 --> 00:19:33.940
using a that as your to determine
 

00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:38.010
using a that as your to determine
whether you were dragging yeah were you

00:19:38.010 --> 00:19:38.020
whether you were dragging yeah were you
 

00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:39.570
whether you were dragging yeah were you
using gesture detector or were you just

00:19:39.570 --> 00:19:39.580
using gesture detector or were you just
 

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:42.530
using gesture detector or were you just
consuming touch events raw touch events

00:19:42.530 --> 00:19:42.540

yes it's handmade that it gets to the

00:19:45.900 --> 00:19:45.910
yes it's handmade that it gets to the
 

00:19:45.910 --> 00:19:48.000
yes it's handmade that it gets to the
addiction okay okay interest interesting

00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:48.010
addiction okay okay interest interesting
 

00:19:48.010 --> 00:19:50.040
addiction okay okay interest interesting
yeah we said that's I you know it's

00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:50.050
yeah we said that's I you know it's
 

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.710
yeah we said that's I you know it's
usually in theory all of our UI is using

00:19:52.710 --> 00:19:52.720
usually in theory all of our UI is using
 

00:19:52.720 --> 00:19:54.420
usually in theory all of our UI is using
gesture detection so that same way

00:19:54.420 --> 00:19:54.430
gesture detection so that same way
 

00:19:54.430 --> 00:19:55.890
gesture detection so that same way
that's a or not all of it a lot of our

00:19:55.890 --> 00:19:55.900
that's a or not all of it a lot of our
 

00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.060
that's a or not all of it a lot of our
UI is using a brother that's your

00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:57.070
UI is using a brother that's your
 

00:19:57.070 --> 00:19:59.040
UI is using a brother that's your
detector so I'm curious you know there

00:19:59.040 --> 00:19:59.050
detector so I'm curious you know there
 

00:19:59.050 --> 00:20:00.600
detector so I'm curious you know there
are pieces in which in which we actually

00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:00.610
are pieces in which in which we actually
 

00:20:00.610 --> 00:20:01.500
are pieces in which in which we actually
go up into our own thing I think we're

00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:01.510
go up into our own thing I think we're
 

00:20:01.510 --> 00:20:02.610
go up into our own thing I think we're
listed a few other things we may be

00:20:02.610 --> 00:20:02.620
listed a few other things we may be
 

00:20:02.620 --> 00:20:04.200
listed a few other things we may be
using other doctors but usually that's

00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:04.210
using other doctors but usually that's
 

00:20:04.210 --> 00:20:05.760
using other doctors but usually that's
that's how we determine whether we're

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:05.770
that's how we determine whether we're
 

00:20:05.770 --> 00:20:06.960
that's how we determine whether we're
touching or dragging so I'm kind of

00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:06.970
touching or dragging so I'm kind of
 

00:20:06.970 --> 00:20:10.380
touching or dragging so I'm kind of
surprised and then you are using scale

00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:10.390
surprised and then you are using scale
 

00:20:10.390 --> 00:20:12.000
surprised and then you are using scale
just a detector to do to do the

00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:12.010
just a detector to do to do the
 

00:20:12.010 --> 00:20:14.730
just a detector to do to do the
multi-touch scale or are you using or

00:20:14.730 --> 00:20:14.740
multi-touch scale or are you using or
 

00:20:14.740 --> 00:20:16.620
multi-touch scale or are you using or
are you consuming the events and doing

00:20:16.620 --> 00:20:16.630
are you consuming the events and doing
 

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:21.480
are you consuming the events and doing
at yourself oh we get the two ends from

00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:21.490
at yourself oh we get the two ends from
 

00:20:21.490 --> 00:20:25.650
at yourself oh we get the two ends from
its GTX ah and so so we get there the

00:20:25.650 --> 00:20:25.660
its GTX ah and so so we get there the
 

00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:28.260
its GTX ah and so so we get there the
events and coordinates and well we

00:20:28.260 --> 00:20:28.270
events and coordinates and well we
 

00:20:28.270 --> 00:20:37.140
events and coordinates and well we
calculate every friend hello yeah the UI

00:20:37.140 --> 00:20:37.150
calculate every friend hello yeah the UI
 

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.460
calculate every friend hello yeah the UI
it's really smooth I'm impressed by that

00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:38.470
it's really smooth I'm impressed by that
 

00:20:38.470 --> 00:20:39.780
it's really smooth I'm impressed by that
yeah it looks it looks really good i

00:20:39.780 --> 00:20:39.790
yeah it looks it looks really good i
 

00:20:39.790 --> 00:20:41.370
yeah it looks it looks really good i
mean the one the one by one comment on

00:20:41.370 --> 00:20:41.380
mean the one the one by one comment on
 

00:20:41.380 --> 00:20:43.230
mean the one the one by one comment on
the scaling was that is that the scaling

00:20:43.230 --> 00:20:43.240
the scaling was that is that the scaling
 

00:20:43.240 --> 00:20:44.700
the scaling was that is that the scaling
isn't a focused or on the point in which

00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:44.710
isn't a focused or on the point in which
 

00:20:44.710 --> 00:20:47.070
isn't a focused or on the point in which
you're in which you're pinching so like

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:47.080
you're in which you're pinching so like
 

00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.540
you're in which you're pinching so like
how would that was my one thing i

00:20:48.540 --> 00:20:48.550
how would that was my one thing i
 

00:20:48.550 --> 00:20:50.190
how would that was my one thing i
noticed like and when I in theory if I

00:20:50.190 --> 00:20:50.200
noticed like and when I in theory if I
 

00:20:50.200 --> 00:20:51.810
noticed like and when I in theory if I
go up here and I pinched it should

00:20:51.810 --> 00:20:51.820
go up here and I pinched it should
 

00:20:51.820 --> 00:20:53.370
go up here and I pinched it should
actually scale around that point and

00:20:53.370 --> 00:20:53.380
actually scale around that point and
 

00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:54.810
actually scale around that point and
it's actually scales around the center

00:20:54.810 --> 00:20:54.820
it's actually scales around the center
 

00:20:54.820 --> 00:20:56.040
it's actually scales around the center
of the screen that was that would be my

00:20:56.040 --> 00:20:56.050
of the screen that was that would be my
 

00:20:56.050 --> 00:20:57.960
of the screen that was that would be my
only comment on the pin zoom it'd be

00:20:57.960 --> 00:20:57.970
only comment on the pin zoom it'd be
 

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.840
only comment on the pin zoom it'd be
cool or if it did that but yeah the game

00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:00.850
cool or if it did that but yeah the game
 

00:21:00.850 --> 00:21:02.220
cool or if it did that but yeah the game
works really really well runs great on

00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:02.230
works really really well runs great on
 

00:21:02.230 --> 00:21:04.740
works really really well runs great on

00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:04.750
the transformer prime what device did
 

00:21:04.750 --> 00:21:06.300
the transformer prime what device did
you test this on if you found my if I

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:06.310

back here and said we come back to here
 

00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:51.620
back here and said we come back to here
and hitting back here goes it exits that

00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:51.630
and hitting back here goes it exits that
 

00:21:51.630 --> 00:21:53.360
and hitting back here goes it exits that
was my only my only real comment about

00:21:53.360 --> 00:21:53.370
was my only my only real comment about
 

00:21:53.370 --> 00:21:55.029
was my only my only real comment about
the navigation other that it looks good

00:21:55.029 --> 00:21:55.039

you know there aren't any there isn't

00:21:57.019 --> 00:21:57.029
you know there aren't any there isn't
 

00:21:57.029 --> 00:21:58.220
you know there aren't any there isn't
any background music so I don't really

00:21:58.220 --> 00:21:58.230
any background music so I don't really
 

00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.720
any background music so I don't really
have a problem there's no real problem

00:21:59.720 --> 00:21:59.730
have a problem there's no real problem
 

00:21:59.730 --> 00:22:01.460
have a problem there's no real problem
with that so you know as far as far as

00:22:01.460 --> 00:22:01.470
with that so you know as far as far as
 

00:22:01.470 --> 00:22:02.960
with that so you know as far as far as
that goes on and then you know it's just

00:22:02.960 --> 00:22:02.970
that goes on and then you know it's just
 

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:04.820
that goes on and then you know it's just
a question of you know the layouts

00:22:04.820 --> 00:22:04.830
a question of you know the layouts
 

00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:06.110
a question of you know the layouts
actually the layout work looks really

00:22:06.110 --> 00:22:06.120
actually the layout work looks really
 

00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:07.220
actually the layout work looks really
good on tablets now it looks fine on

00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:07.230
good on tablets now it looks fine on
 

00:22:07.230 --> 00:22:09.070
good on tablets now it looks fine on
phone so I think from that perspective

00:22:09.070 --> 00:22:09.080
phone so I think from that perspective
 

00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.120
phone so I think from that perspective
it's looking really good to running

00:22:11.120 --> 00:22:11.130
it's looking really good to running
 

00:22:11.130 --> 00:22:12.649
it's looking really good to running
really well yeah it's a really great

00:22:12.649 --> 00:22:12.659
really well yeah it's a really great
 

00:22:12.659 --> 00:22:13.970
really well yeah it's a really great
game that in that respect I think

00:22:13.970 --> 00:22:13.980
game that in that respect I think
 

00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:15.350
game that in that respect I think
there's you know the one thing that I

00:22:15.350 --> 00:22:15.360
there's you know the one thing that I
 

00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:18.200
there's you know the one thing that I
wanted to point out that I think you

00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:18.210
wanted to point out that I think you
 

00:22:18.210 --> 00:22:20.960
wanted to point out that I think you
might want to consider is just the the

00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:20.970
might want to consider is just the the
 

00:22:20.970 --> 00:22:24.110
might want to consider is just the the
art style and and the the art of the

00:22:24.110 --> 00:22:24.120
art style and and the the art of the
 

00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.549
art style and and the the art of the
game is so well done and I'm certain

00:22:25.549 --> 00:22:25.559
game is so well done and I'm certain
 

00:22:25.559 --> 00:22:28.460
game is so well done and I'm certain
it's deliberate but you know I'm a

00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:28.470
it's deliberate but you know I'm a
 

00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.220
it's deliberate but you know I'm a
little concerned about the just all the

00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:31.230
little concerned about the just all the
 

00:22:31.230 --> 00:22:33.560
little concerned about the just all the
sharp edges we see here especially when

00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:33.570
sharp edges we see here especially when
 

00:22:33.570 --> 00:22:34.850
sharp edges we see here especially when
you've got the floating islands I don't

00:22:34.850 --> 00:22:34.860
you've got the floating islands I don't
 

00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.139
you've got the floating islands I don't
know if there are any on this level or

00:22:36.139 --> 00:22:36.149

00:22:36.149 --> 00:22:38.810
know if there are any on this level or
not I don't think there are can we go

00:22:38.810 --> 00:22:38.820

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:42.950
not I don't think there are can we go

beginning okay you can see these these
 

00:23:03.899 --> 00:23:07.159
beginning okay you can see these these
floating islands here have these really

00:23:07.159 --> 00:23:07.169
floating islands here have these really
 

00:23:07.169 --> 00:23:11.060
floating islands here have these really
really sharp edges on them we um and to

00:23:11.060 --> 00:23:11.070
really sharp edges on them we um and to
 

00:23:11.070 --> 00:23:13.010
really sharp edges on them we um and to
me that's just one of those things that

00:23:13.010 --> 00:23:13.020
me that's just one of those things that
 

00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:16.639
me that's just one of those things that
sort of says hey you know maybe maybe

00:23:16.639 --> 00:23:16.649
sort of says hey you know maybe maybe
 

00:23:16.649 --> 00:23:18.590

didn't spend a whole lot of time on this

00:23:18.590 --> 00:23:18.600
didn't spend a whole lot of time on this
 

00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.539
didn't spend a whole lot of time on this
part of the art but you obviously did

00:23:20.539 --> 00:23:20.549
part of the art but you obviously did
 

00:23:20.549 --> 00:23:22.010
part of the art but you obviously did
spend a lot of time on other parts of

00:23:22.010 --> 00:23:22.020
spend a lot of time on other parts of
 

00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.289
spend a lot of time on other parts of
the art so it's it's a shame that that

00:23:24.289 --> 00:23:24.299
the art so it's it's a shame that that
 

00:23:24.299 --> 00:23:26.960
the art so it's it's a shame that that
particular part doesn't seem as polish

00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:26.970
particular part doesn't seem as polish
 

00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:28.039
particular part doesn't seem as polish
yeah these edges here especially the

00:23:28.039 --> 00:23:28.049
yeah these edges here especially the
 

00:23:28.049 --> 00:23:28.940
yeah these edges here especially the
other thing I was going to say it'd be

00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:28.950
other thing I was going to say it'd be
 

00:23:28.950 --> 00:23:29.990
other thing I was going to say it'd be
really cool to see a couple of some

00:23:29.990 --> 00:23:30.000
really cool to see a couple of some
 

00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:32.180
really cool to see a couple of some
animation on the on the cow itself like

00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.190
animation on the on the cow itself like
 

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.440
animation on the on the cow itself like
I think I think you've got a cute little

00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:33.450
I think I think you've got a cute little
 

00:23:33.450 --> 00:23:34.850
I think I think you've got a cute little
character there be cool to see his eyes

00:23:34.850 --> 00:23:34.860

kind of funny that he just rolls around
 

00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:41.450
kind of funny that he just rolls around
so you have to balance the comedy of

00:23:41.450 --> 00:23:41.460
so you have to balance the comedy of
 

00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:42.440
so you have to balance the comedy of
that but I think it'd be kind of cool

00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:42.450
that but I think it'd be kind of cool
 

00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:42.840
that but I think it'd be kind of cool
dad

00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:42.850
dad
 

00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:44.130
dad
do you know have a couple little

00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:44.140
do you know have a couple little
 

00:23:44.140 --> 00:23:45.930
do you know have a couple little
behaviors thrown in there yeah that's

00:23:45.930 --> 00:23:45.940
behaviors thrown in there yeah that's
 

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:47.460
behaviors thrown in there yeah that's
well that's a advice that we give a lot

00:23:47.460 --> 00:23:47.470
well that's a advice that we give a lot
 

00:23:47.470 --> 00:23:50.850
well that's a advice that we give a lot
because we noticed that games where

00:23:50.850 --> 00:23:50.860
because we noticed that games where
 

00:23:50.860 --> 00:23:52.500
because we noticed that games where
there's a lot of animation on the main

00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:52.510
there's a lot of animation on the main
 

00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:54.930
there's a lot of animation on the main
character tend to do better because

00:23:54.930 --> 00:23:54.940
character tend to do better because
 

00:23:54.940 --> 00:23:57.510
character tend to do better because
people begin to develop an emotional

00:23:57.510 --> 00:23:57.520
people begin to develop an emotional
 

00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:00.060
people begin to develop an emotional
attachment to that character yeah so we

00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:00.070
attachment to that character yeah so we
 

00:24:00.070 --> 00:24:02.310
attachment to that character yeah so we
will put on our psychologist at here and

00:24:02.310 --> 00:24:02.320
will put on our psychologist at here and
 

00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:05.100
will put on our psychologist at here and
i think exactly you know it's that it's

00:24:05.100 --> 00:24:05.110
i think exactly you know it's that it's
 

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.690
i think exactly you know it's that it's
that but yeah I think is I think it's

00:24:06.690 --> 00:24:06.700
that but yeah I think is I think it's
 

00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:07.890
that but yeah I think is I think it's
true and so that's always always

00:24:07.890 --> 00:24:07.900
true and so that's always always
 

00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:09.420
true and so that's always always
something we do saying you know it's

00:24:09.420 --> 00:24:09.430
something we do saying you know it's
 

00:24:09.430 --> 00:24:11.580
something we do saying you know it's
it's been it's been pretty consistent we

00:24:11.580 --> 00:24:11.590
it's been it's been pretty consistent we
 

00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:12.530
it's been it's been pretty consistent we
think it's part of the reason why

00:24:12.530 --> 00:24:12.540
think it's part of the reason why
 

00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:14.610
think it's part of the reason why
certain games like cutthroat and angry

00:24:14.610 --> 00:24:14.620
certain games like cutthroat and angry
 

00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.990
certain games like cutthroat and angry
birds are actually as successful as they

birds are actually as successful as they
 

00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:17.460
birds are actually as successful as they
are is because they really have spent a

are is because they really have spent a
 

00:24:17.470 --> 00:24:19.470
are is because they really have spent a
lot of time on those characters even

00:24:19.470 --> 00:24:19.480

art that's just that's just in a couple

00:27:01.320 --> 00:27:01.330
art that's just that's just in a couple
 

00:27:01.330 --> 00:27:02.909
art that's just that's just in a couple
of layers but it looks really high res

00:27:02.909 --> 00:27:02.919
of layers but it looks really high res
 

00:27:02.919 --> 00:27:05.249
of layers but it looks really high res
and there's there's some nice little

00:27:05.249 --> 00:27:05.259
and there's there's some nice little
 

00:27:05.259 --> 00:27:08.089
and there's there's some nice little
effect there with the you know the

00:27:08.089 --> 00:27:08.099
effect there with the you know the
 

00:27:08.099 --> 00:27:10.289
effect there with the you know the
blurring that's going on for the things

00:27:10.289 --> 00:27:10.299
blurring that's going on for the things
 

00:27:10.299 --> 00:27:11.519
blurring that's going on for the things
that are in front it just looks like a

00:27:11.519 --> 00:27:11.529
that are in front it just looks like a
 

00:27:11.529 --> 00:27:13.619
that are in front it just looks like a
little sort of a depth of field actually

00:27:13.619 --> 00:27:13.629
little sort of a depth of field actually
 

00:27:13.629 --> 00:27:14.969
little sort of a depth of field actually
almost feels like got the field even

00:27:14.969 --> 00:27:14.979
almost feels like got the field even
 

00:27:14.979 --> 00:27:16.229
almost feels like got the field even
though all it is is that it's just

00:27:16.229 --> 00:27:16.239
though all it is is that it's just
 

00:27:16.239 --> 00:27:17.940
though all it is is that it's just
blurry and fry the house right it funny

00:27:17.940 --> 00:27:17.950

and if you can see there's there's some
 

00:27:19.659 --> 00:27:20.999
and if you can see there's there's some
nice alpha bundy going on there as well

00:27:20.999 --> 00:27:21.009
nice alpha bundy going on there as well
 

00:27:21.009 --> 00:27:24.149

00:27:47.679 --> 00:27:49.739
the way oh wait I've got no network ha
so uh that makes this game a lot less

00:27:49.739 --> 00:27:49.749
so uh that makes this game a lot less
 

00:27:49.749 --> 00:27:52.320
so uh that makes this game a lot less
exciting so you know no max quit oh I

00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:52.330
exciting so you know no max quit oh I
 

00:27:52.330 --> 00:27:55.139
exciting so you know no max quit oh I
don't know um it's anyways I think we

00:27:55.139 --> 00:27:55.149
don't know um it's anyways I think we
 

00:27:55.149 --> 00:27:57.749
don't know um it's anyways I think we
might have to reboot the device I don't

00:27:57.749 --> 00:27:57.759
might have to reboot the device I don't
 

00:27:57.759 --> 00:27:59.849
might have to reboot the device I don't
know I want to actually get network um

00:27:59.849 --> 00:27:59.859
know I want to actually get network um
 

00:27:59.859 --> 00:28:01.829
know I want to actually get network um
no no we just need to turn Wi-Fi off and

00:28:01.829 --> 00:28:01.839
no no we just need to turn Wi-Fi off and
 

00:28:01.839 --> 00:28:05.430
no no we just need to turn Wi-Fi off and
on again okay it's a good point I got

00:28:05.430 --> 00:28:05.440
on again okay it's a good point I got
 

00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:08.010
on again okay it's a good point I got
one of these you

00:28:08.010 --> 00:28:08.020
 
 

00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:13.390
 
okay connect painting I connected see

00:28:13.390 --> 00:28:13.400
okay connect painting I connected see
 

00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:14.560
okay connect painting I connected see
how are you right you're right

00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:14.570
how are you right you're right
 

00:28:14.570 --> 00:28:16.560
how are you right you're right
absolutely well this we are we are on

00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:16.570
absolutely well this we are we are on
 

00:28:16.570 --> 00:28:18.970
absolutely well this we are we are on
google guest which is the world's most

00:28:18.970 --> 00:28:18.980
google guest which is the world's most
 

00:28:18.980 --> 00:28:20.740
google guest which is the world's most
complicated Wi-Fi network i think so and

00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:20.750
complicated Wi-Fi network i think so and
 

00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:22.750
complicated Wi-Fi network i think so and
we it's great for our testing purposes

00:28:22.750 --> 00:28:22.760
we it's great for our testing purposes
 

00:28:22.760 --> 00:28:25.620
we it's great for our testing purposes
because it constantly fails us so you

00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:25.630
because it constantly fails us so you
 

00:28:25.630 --> 00:28:27.610
because it constantly fails us so you
should we should have really really

00:28:27.610 --> 00:28:27.620
should we should have really really
 

00:28:27.620 --> 00:28:29.680
should we should have really really
robust Wi-Fi stacks to happen with this

00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:29.690
robust Wi-Fi stacks to happen with this
 

00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:31.060
robust Wi-Fi stacks to happen with this
i would imagine the amount of

00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:31.070
i would imagine the amount of
 

00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:32.980
i would imagine the amount of
electromagnetic radiation in this

00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:32.990
electromagnetic radiation in this
 

00:28:32.990 --> 00:28:36.850
electromagnetic radiation in this
building it is it okay yeah yeah we're

00:28:36.850 --> 00:28:36.860
building it is it okay yeah yeah we're
 

00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:39.480
building it is it okay yeah yeah we're
all do work that's what I that's right

00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:39.490
all do work that's what I that's right
 

00:28:39.490 --> 00:28:41.440
all do work that's what I that's right
alright so now and now I should be able

00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:41.450
alright so now and now I should be able
 

00:28:41.450 --> 00:28:42.610
alright so now and now I should be able
to actually log in to show you the game

00:28:42.610 --> 00:28:42.620
to actually log in to show you the game
 

00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.310
to actually log in to show you the game
so this game actor reminds me a little

00:28:45.310 --> 00:28:45.320
so this game actor reminds me a little
 

00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:46.660
so this game actor reminds me a little
bit of a game that I played it when i

00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:46.670
bit of a game that I played it when i
 

00:28:46.670 --> 00:28:49.660
bit of a game that I played it when i
was in college called multitrack yeah

00:28:49.660 --> 00:28:49.670
was in college called multitrack yeah
 

00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:52.480
was in college called multitrack yeah
yeah and and it's with sort of this

00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:52.490
yeah and and it's with sort of this
 

00:28:52.490 --> 00:28:54.160
yeah and and it's with sort of this
graphical overlay basically here is the

00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:54.170
graphical overlay basically here is the
 

00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:56.020
graphical overlay basically here is the
universe as we see it underlay wouldn't

00:28:56.020 --> 00:28:56.030
universe as we see it underlay wouldn't
 

00:28:56.030 --> 00:28:59.710
universe as we see it underlay wouldn't
you say yeah yeah and there's a so this

00:28:59.710 --> 00:28:59.720
you say yeah yeah and there's a so this
 

00:28:59.720 --> 00:29:00.880
you say yeah yeah and there's a so this
is this is this is our map of the

00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:00.890
is this is this is our map of the
 

00:29:00.890 --> 00:29:02.230
is this is this is our map of the
universe which is basically a bunch of

00:29:02.230 --> 00:29:02.240
universe which is basically a bunch of
 

00:29:02.240 --> 00:29:03.580
universe which is basically a bunch of
squares that we can travel to you so i

00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:03.590
squares that we can travel to you so i
 

00:29:03.590 --> 00:29:05.050
squares that we can travel to you so i
can say i want to go clear and i want to

00:29:05.050 --> 00:29:05.060
can say i want to go clear and i want to
 

00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:07.030
can say i want to go clear and i want to
jump to that square and you see it's

00:29:07.030 --> 00:29:07.040
jump to that square and you see it's
 

00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.410
jump to that square and you see it's
gonna it's going to give me i can go

00:29:08.410 --> 00:29:08.420
gonna it's going to give me i can go
 

00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:11.110
gonna it's going to give me i can go
jump three two one and now i'm working

00:29:11.110 --> 00:29:11.120
jump three two one and now i'm working
 

00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:13.270
jump three two one and now i'm working
through space there we are well that's

00:29:13.270 --> 00:29:13.280
through space there we are well that's
 

00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:16.360
through space there we are well that's
massive change to what's going on um

00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:16.370
massive change to what's going on um
 

00:29:16.370 --> 00:29:18.340
massive change to what's going on um
let's see wait I think I might have not

00:29:18.340 --> 00:29:18.350
let's see wait I think I might have not
 

00:29:18.350 --> 00:29:19.750
let's see wait I think I might have not
actually warped all the way let's try it

00:29:19.750 --> 00:29:19.760
actually warped all the way let's try it
 

00:29:19.760 --> 00:29:22.240
actually warped all the way let's try it
sets go gotta make multiple jumps here

00:29:22.240 --> 00:29:22.250
sets go gotta make multiple jumps here
 

00:29:22.250 --> 00:29:25.240
sets go gotta make multiple jumps here
so you so basically there we are now

00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:25.250
so you so basically there we are now
 

00:29:25.250 --> 00:29:26.950
so you so basically there we are now
we're warping you see you can see I'm

00:29:26.950 --> 00:29:26.960
we're warping you see you can see I'm
 

00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:29.680
we're warping you see you can see I'm
moving um oh wait there's pirates so I

00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:29.690
moving um oh wait there's pirates so I
 

00:29:29.690 --> 00:29:31.150
moving um oh wait there's pirates so I
can attack the Pirates I just tapped on

what does kind of remind me of like Ned
track or it is little school muds it's

00:30:37.270 --> 00:30:37.280
track or it is little school muds it's
 

00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.740

like this is obviously is the

00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:38.750
like this is obviously is the
 

00:30:38.750 --> 00:30:40.690
like this is obviously is the
programmers game and it just got built

00:30:40.690 --> 00:30:40.700
programmers game and it just got built
 

00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:42.310
programmers game and it just got built
up and built up and there's all kinds of

00:30:42.310 --> 00:30:42.320
up and built up and there's all kinds of
 

00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:44.770
up and built up and there's all kinds of
cool stuff attached to it yes um but

00:30:44.770 --> 00:30:44.780
cool stuff attached to it yes um but
 

00:30:44.780 --> 00:30:46.600
cool stuff attached to it yes um but
quite honestly if you're not already in

00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:46.610
quite honestly if you're not already in
 

00:30:46.610 --> 00:30:49.870
quite honestly if you're not already in
the community there's somewhat less of

00:30:49.870 --> 00:30:49.880
the community there's somewhat less of
 

00:30:49.880 --> 00:30:51.820
the community there's somewhat less of
an incentive to join yeah and I will say

00:30:51.820 --> 00:30:51.830
an incentive to join yeah and I will say
 

00:30:51.830 --> 00:30:52.990
an incentive to join yeah and I will say
you know this it's a difficult thing

00:30:52.990 --> 00:30:53.000
you know this it's a difficult thing
 

00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.310
you know this it's a difficult thing
this is actually this is an MMO it's

this is actually this is an MMO it's
 

00:30:54.320 --> 00:30:56.770
this is actually this is an MMO it's
difficult to know what to do in the case

00:30:56.770 --> 00:30:56.780
difficult to know what to do in the case
 

00:30:56.780 --> 00:30:59.230
difficult to know what to do in the case

00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:01.090
that you had like an incoming call so
well you know so here's what happens if

00:31:01.090 --> 00:31:01.100
well you know so here's what happens if
 

00:31:01.100 --> 00:31:02.500
well you know so here's what happens if
you let's head push the lock button here

00:31:02.500 --> 00:31:02.510
you let's head push the lock button here
 

00:31:02.510 --> 00:31:04.390
you let's head push the lock button here
we'll go back to our lock screen and

00:31:04.390 --> 00:31:04.400
we'll go back to our lock screen and
 

00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:06.910
we'll go back to our lock screen and
we'll hit the button again and go back

00:31:06.910 --> 00:31:06.920
we'll hit the button again and go back
 

00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:08.350
we'll hit the button again and go back
into the game as you can see the games

00:31:08.350 --> 00:31:08.360
into the game as you can see the games
 

00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.630
into the game as you can see the games
gone and that's because as soon as the

00:31:10.630 --> 00:31:10.640
gone and that's because as soon as the
 

00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.520
gone and that's because as soon as the
game locked it's a real-time game and so

00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:12.530
game locked it's a real-time game and so
 

00:31:12.530 --> 00:31:14.850
game locked it's a real-time game and so
it logged you out and closes right now

00:31:14.850 --> 00:31:14.860
it logged you out and closes right now
 

00:31:14.860 --> 00:31:17.320
it logged you out and closes right now
probably law you know probably logging

00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:17.330
probably law you know probably logging
 

00:31:17.330 --> 00:31:20.080
probably law you know probably logging
you out not such a bad idea you but you

00:31:20.080 --> 00:31:20.090
you out not such a bad idea you but you
 

00:31:20.090 --> 00:31:21.370
you out not such a bad idea you but you
know I mean you could be as you say I'm

00:31:21.370 --> 00:31:21.380
know I mean you could be as you say I'm
 

00:31:21.380 --> 00:31:22.780
know I mean you could be as you say I'm
in a sector I could be attacked right

00:31:22.780 --> 00:31:22.790
in a sector I could be attacked right
 

00:31:22.790 --> 00:31:24.910
in a sector I could be attacked right
now so it's kind of frustrating that

00:31:24.910 --> 00:31:24.920
now so it's kind of frustrating that
 

00:31:24.920 --> 00:31:26.140
now so it's kind of frustrating that
I've been logged on it doesn't try to

00:31:26.140 --> 00:31:26.150
I've been logged on it doesn't try to
 

00:31:26.150 --> 00:31:28.270
I've been logged on it doesn't try to
log me back in but I kind of understand

00:31:28.270 --> 00:31:28.280
log me back in but I kind of understand
 

00:31:28.280 --> 00:31:30.910
log me back in but I kind of understand
that well I don't know about that but

00:31:30.910 --> 00:31:30.920
that well I don't know about that but
 

00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.040
that well I don't know about that but
you know it's certainly not the most

00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:33.050
you know it's certainly not the most
 

00:31:33.050 --> 00:31:34.690
you know it's certainly not the most
user-friendly behavior well let's face

00:31:34.690 --> 00:31:34.700
user-friendly behavior well let's face
 

00:31:34.700 --> 00:31:36.310
user-friendly behavior well let's face
it you know if you're playing this game

00:31:36.310 --> 00:31:36.320
it you know if you're playing this game
 

00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.510
it you know if you're playing this game
if you're really into this get you're

00:31:37.510 --> 00:31:37.520
if you're really into this get you're

you'll end up feeling of getting kicked

00:31:53.380 --> 00:31:53.390
you'll end up feeling of getting kicked
 

00:31:53.390 --> 00:31:54.790
you'll end up feeling of getting kicked
out of the game and it's kind of it's

00:31:54.790 --> 00:31:54.800
out of the game and it's kind of it's
 

00:31:54.800 --> 00:31:55.960
out of the game and it's kind of it's
kind of an interesting problem for any

think that you know we at Google have

00:33:14.230 --> 00:33:14.240
think that you know we at Google have
 

00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.960
think that you know we at Google have
had our own challenges with that I it's

00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:16.970
had our own challenges with that I it's
 

00:33:16.970 --> 00:33:19.480
had our own challenges with that I it's
taking a long time to evolve to where we

00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:19.490
taking a long time to evolve to where we
 

00:33:19.490 --> 00:33:22.720
taking a long time to evolve to where we
are but at this point yeah the the

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:22.730
are but at this point yeah the the
 

00:33:22.730 --> 00:33:25.180
are but at this point yeah the the
operating system can support a lot of

00:33:25.180 --> 00:33:25.190
operating system can support a lot of
 

00:33:25.190 --> 00:33:28.440
operating system can support a lot of
really nice smooth magical behavior but

00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:28.450
really nice smooth magical behavior but
 

00:33:28.450 --> 00:33:31.900
really nice smooth magical behavior but
the application has to cooperate now

00:33:31.900 --> 00:33:31.910
the application has to cooperate now
 

00:33:31.910 --> 00:33:32.890

actually switch back to the game stroma

00:33:36.970 --> 00:33:36.980
actually switch back to the game stroma
 

00:33:36.980 --> 00:33:38.350
actually switch back to the game stroma
second was going to comment on the UI so

00:33:38.350 --> 00:33:38.360
second was going to comment on the UI so
 

00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:40.180
second was going to comment on the UI so
rana we're on a transformer prime and

00:33:40.180 --> 00:33:40.190
rana we're on a transformer prime and
 

00:33:40.190 --> 00:33:41.830
rana we're on a transformer prime and
you know tablets are interesting because

00:33:41.830 --> 00:33:41.840
you know tablets are interesting because
 

00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:46.210
you know tablets are interesting because
this is actually a ma mdpi device so

00:33:46.210 --> 00:33:46.220
this is actually a ma mdpi device so
 

00:33:46.220 --> 00:33:48.700
this is actually a ma mdpi device so
it's a medium density device and has a

00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:48.710
it's a medium density device and has a
 

00:33:48.710 --> 00:33:52.900
it's a medium density device and has a
fairly small default font and which is

00:33:52.900 --> 00:33:52.910
fairly small default font and which is
 

00:33:52.910 --> 00:33:54.070
fairly small default font and which is
actually kind of nice for this sort of

00:33:54.070 --> 00:33:54.080
actually kind of nice for this sort of
 

00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:56.170
actually kind of nice for this sort of
game you accept that the text is really

00:33:56.170 --> 00:33:56.180
game you accept that the text is really
 

00:33:56.180 --> 00:33:58.660
game you accept that the text is really
really tiny did you try this on a phone

00:33:58.660 --> 00:33:58.670
really tiny did you try this on a phone
 

00:33:58.670 --> 00:34:01.360
really tiny did you try this on a phone
though I did not it's impossible oh it's

00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:01.370
though I did not it's impossible oh it's
 

00:34:01.370 --> 00:34:04.300
though I did not it's impossible oh it's
so difficult yeah so this is this is

00:34:04.300 --> 00:34:04.310
so difficult yeah so this is this is
 

00:34:04.310 --> 00:34:06.310
so difficult yeah so this is this is
really a tablet only game at what were

there yeah I have to admit I did take me
 

00:34:15.830 --> 00:34:17.290
there yeah I have to admit I did take me
about five minutes to figure out what I

00:34:17.290 --> 00:34:17.300
about five minutes to figure out what I
 

00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:18.730
about five minutes to figure out what I
was supposed to do is in the game even

00:34:18.730 --> 00:34:18.740
was supposed to do is in the game even
 

00:34:18.740 --> 00:34:20.500
was supposed to do is in the game even
reading through the tutorial which is a

00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:20.510
reading through the tutorial which is a
 

00:34:20.510 --> 00:34:22.930
reading through the tutorial which is a
website i would love to some because you

00:34:24.340 --> 00:34:24.350
know you're interacting in real time
 

00:34:24.350 --> 00:34:26.200
know you're interacting in real time
with other people nothing stops to let

00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:26.210
with other people nothing stops to let
 

00:34:26.210 --> 00:34:27.909

00:34:29.710 --> 00:34:29.720
whatever so Emma most tend to have a lot
 

00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.450
whatever so Emma most tend to have a lot
of things on the screen because yes you

00:34:31.450 --> 00:34:31.460
of things on the screen because yes you
 

00:34:31.460 --> 00:34:33.280
of things on the screen because yes you
don't want to go modal yeah I think so

00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:33.290
don't want to go modal yeah I think so
 

00:34:33.290 --> 00:34:34.659
don't want to go modal yeah I think so
another thing like I would really love

00:34:34.659 --> 00:34:34.669
another thing like I would really love
 

00:34:34.669 --> 00:34:36.730
another thing like I would really love
to tutorial just to pull up webview like

00:34:36.730 --> 00:34:36.740
to tutorial just to pull up webview like
 

00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.290
to tutorial just to pull up webview like
I think that I think it would be because

00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:38.300
I think that I think it would be because
 

00:34:38.300 --> 00:34:39.640
I think that I think it would be because
the main problem is again it kicks you

00:34:39.640 --> 00:34:39.650
the main problem is again it kicks you
 

00:34:39.650 --> 00:34:41.230
the main problem is again it kicks you
out of the cute Oriole does pull up web

00:34:41.230 --> 00:34:41.240
out of the cute Oriole does pull up web
 

00:34:41.240 --> 00:34:43.210
out of the cute Oriole does pull up web
you know it pulls 00 a website puts you

00:34:43.210 --> 00:34:43.220
you know it pulls 00 a website puts you
 

00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.020
you know it pulls 00 a website puts you
into the browser

00:34:44.020 --> 00:34:44.030
into the browser
 

00:34:44.030 --> 00:34:45.430
into the browser
and so then what ends up happening is it

00:34:45.430 --> 00:34:45.440
and so then what ends up happening is it
 

00:34:45.440 --> 00:34:46.390
and so then what ends up happening is it
kicks you out of the game you hit the

00:34:46.390 --> 00:34:46.400
kicks you out of the game you hit the
 

00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:50.350
kicks you out of the game you hit the
backhand boom along and so oh so it's

00:34:50.350 --> 00:34:50.360
backhand boom along and so oh so it's
 

00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.340
backhand boom along and so oh so it's
ruining the experience really

00:34:51.340 --> 00:34:51.350
ruining the experience really
 

00:34:51.350 --> 00:34:52.690
ruining the experience really
interesting so it's hard it's hard to

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:52.700
interesting so it's hard it's hard to
 

00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.520
interesting so it's hard it's hard to
believe that they're actually using

00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:54.530
believe that they're actually using
 

00:34:54.530 --> 00:34:56.560
believe that they're actually using
enough resources to justify think you

00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:56.570
enough resources to justify think you
 

00:34:56.570 --> 00:35:00.370
enough resources to justify think you
could really in the back key and so so

00:35:00.370 --> 00:35:00.380
could really in the back key and so so
 

00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:01.990
could really in the back key and so so
you know there's two that and I think

00:35:01.990 --> 00:35:02.000
you know there's two that and I think
 

00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:02.920
you know there's two that and I think
that's a pretty good way to end things

00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:02.930
that's a pretty good way to end things
 

00:35:02.930 --> 00:35:04.720
that's a pretty good way to end things
you know there's just a lot of lot of

00:35:04.720 --> 00:35:04.730
you know there's just a lot of lot of
 

00:35:04.730 --> 00:35:06.070
you know there's just a lot of lot of
really cool polish stuff that can be

00:35:06.070 --> 00:35:06.080
really cool polish stuff that can be
 

00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:07.780
really cool polish stuff that can be
done but you know I'm uh certainly I

00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:07.790
done but you know I'm uh certainly I
 

00:35:07.790 --> 00:35:09.550
done but you know I'm uh certainly I
know you guys are small teen and I

00:35:09.550 --> 00:35:09.560
know you guys are small teen and I
 

00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:10.660
know you guys are small teen and I
commend you on what you guys have done

00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:10.670
commend you on what you guys have done
 

00:35:10.670 --> 00:35:12.820
commend you on what you guys have done
and you know it's pulling this kind of

00:35:12.820 --> 00:35:12.830
and you know it's pulling this kind of
 

00:35:12.830 --> 00:35:14.620
and you know it's pulling this kind of
experience into Android into any kind of

00:35:14.620 --> 00:35:14.630
experience into Android into any kind of
 

00:35:14.630 --> 00:35:16.120
experience into Android into any kind of
mobile environment is not easy

00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:16.130
mobile environment is not easy
 

00:35:16.130 --> 00:35:17.350
mobile environment is not easy
especially something that's really

00:35:17.350 --> 00:35:17.360
especially something that's really
 

00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:18.820
especially something that's really
designed out a lot of text interaction

00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:18.830
designed out a lot of text interaction
 

00:35:18.830 --> 00:35:21.580
designed out a lot of text interaction
and and so this is you know really good

00:35:21.580 --> 00:35:21.590
and and so this is you know really good
 

00:35:21.590 --> 00:35:22.930
and and so this is you know really good
start but you know I think I think that

00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:22.940
start but you know I think I think that
 

00:35:22.940 --> 00:35:24.580
start but you know I think I think that
it can go you can just take this so much

00:35:24.580 --> 00:35:24.590
it can go you can just take this so much
 

00:35:24.590 --> 00:35:26.050
it can go you can just take this so much

we're ready on the next camera will try

00:35:56.080 --> 00:35:56.090
we're ready on the next camera will try
 

00:35:56.090 --> 00:35:59.410

elemental jewels and elemental jewels is

00:36:01.900 --> 00:36:01.910
elemental jewels and elemental jewels is
 

00:36:01.910 --> 00:36:04.360
elemental jewels and elemental jewels is
actually a game which I am showing going

00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:04.370
actually a game which I am showing going
 

00:36:04.370 --> 00:36:06.600
actually a game which I am showing going
show you take a look at it running in

00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:06.610
show you take a look at it running in
 

00:36:06.610 --> 00:36:08.770
show you take a look at it running in
compatibility mode and the reason why

00:36:08.770 --> 00:36:08.780
compatibility mode and the reason why
 

00:36:08.780 --> 00:36:10.480
compatibility mode and the reason why
I'm running this in compatibility mode

00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:10.490
I'm running this in compatibility mode
 

00:36:10.490 --> 00:36:12.550
I'm running this in compatibility mode
is because this is actually one of the

00:36:12.550 --> 00:36:12.560
is because this is actually one of the
 

00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:15.670
is because this is actually one of the
first games we've used that is totally

00:36:15.670 --> 00:36:15.680
first games we've used that is totally
 

00:36:15.680 --> 00:36:17.140
first games we've used that is totally
unplayable if it's not in compatibility

00:36:17.140 --> 00:36:17.150
unplayable if it's not in compatibility
 

00:36:17.150 --> 00:36:18.940
unplayable if it's not in compatibility
mode which is a shame because the

00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:18.950
mode which is a shame because the
 

00:36:18.950 --> 00:36:20.350
mode which is a shame because the
graphics actually are very high

00:36:20.350 --> 00:36:20.360
graphics actually are very high
 

00:36:20.360 --> 00:36:23.080
graphics actually are very high
resolution look good but the frame rate

00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:23.090
resolution look good but the frame rate
 

00:36:23.090 --> 00:36:25.480
resolution look good but the frame rate
is so so disappointing on this device

00:36:25.480 --> 00:36:25.490
is so so disappointing on this device
 

00:36:25.490 --> 00:36:27.430
is so so disappointing on this device
that it's almost unplayable I was I was

00:36:27.430 --> 00:36:27.440
that it's almost unplayable I was I was
 

00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:28.960
that it's almost unplayable I was I was
getting just a couple of frames a second

00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:28.970
getting just a couple of frames a second
 

00:36:28.970 --> 00:36:30.700
getting just a couple of frames a second
playing the game and it made it really

00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:30.710
playing the game and it made it really
 

00:36:30.710 --> 00:36:33.460
playing the game and it made it really
really hard to play and also the text is

00:36:33.460 --> 00:36:33.470
really hard to play and also the text is
 

00:36:33.470 --> 00:36:36.610
really hard to play and also the text is
really really small so this is what is

00:36:36.610 --> 00:36:36.620
really really small so this is what is
 

00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:38.800
really really small so this is what is
one of those rare games in which it

00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:38.810
one of those rare games in which it
 

00:36:38.810 --> 00:36:40.120
one of those rare games in which it
makes it actually makes a lot of sense

00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:40.130
makes it actually makes a lot of sense
 

00:36:40.130 --> 00:36:41.440
makes it actually makes a lot of sense
to take advantage of some built-in

00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:41.450
to take advantage of some built-in
 

00:36:41.450 --> 00:36:42.670
to take advantage of some built-in
system features if you're not going to

00:36:42.670 --> 00:36:42.680
system features if you're not going to
 

00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:45.310
system features if you're not going to
actually go through and I optimize the

00:36:45.310 --> 00:36:45.320
actually go through and I optimize the
 

00:36:45.320 --> 00:36:46.870
actually go through and I optimize the
game around the tablet the easiest thing

00:36:46.870 --> 00:36:46.880
game around the tablet the easiest thing
 

00:36:46.880 --> 00:36:49.180
game around the tablet the easiest thing
for you to do is actually take advantage

00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:49.190
for you to do is actually take advantage
 

00:36:49.190 --> 00:36:50.680
for you to do is actually take advantage
of some of the features we have in

00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:50.690
of some of the features we have in
 

00:36:50.690 --> 00:36:53.140

made the game much more playable so

00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:06.950

00:37:21.670 --> 00:37:21.680
game and this is another one of those
 

00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:22.720

really really careful about the back key

00:37:24.190 --> 00:37:24.200
really really careful about the back key
 

00:37:24.200 --> 00:37:26.019
really really careful about the back key
because it works in some places and not

00:37:26.019 --> 00:37:26.029
because it works in some places and not
 

00:37:26.029 --> 00:37:27.400

another so right now I'm here and

00:37:27.400 --> 00:37:27.410
another so right now I'm here and
 

00:37:27.410 --> 00:37:28.720

hitting the back key does absolutely

00:37:28.720 --> 00:37:28.730
hitting the back key does absolutely
 

00:37:28.730 --> 00:37:30.849
hitting the back key does absolutely
nothing and you know what should it do

00:37:30.849 --> 00:37:30.859
nothing and you know what should it do
 

00:37:30.859 --> 00:37:32.049
nothing and you know what should it do
well it probably should take it back to

00:37:32.049 --> 00:37:32.059
well it probably should take it back to
 

00:37:32.059 --> 00:37:33.370
well it probably should take it back to
the screen before then so there's all

00:37:33.370 --> 00:37:33.380
the screen before then so there's all
 

00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.950
the screen before then so there's all
there's quite a lot of that in the game

00:37:34.950 --> 00:37:34.960
there's quite a lot of that in the game
 

00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.729
there's quite a lot of that in the game
when you actually get into the game

00:37:36.729 --> 00:37:36.739
when you actually get into the game
 

00:37:36.739 --> 00:37:37.989

hitting the back key brings up the pause

00:37:37.989 --> 00:37:37.999
hitting the back key brings up the pause
 

00:37:37.999 --> 00:37:39.220

screen that's cool when you hit the back
again and then nothing happens so you

00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:40.970
again and then nothing happens so you
 

00:37:40.970 --> 00:37:42.009
again and then nothing happens so you
know it's like it's sort of like halfway

the kind of help you I don't didn't

00:38:40.690 --> 00:38:40.700
the kind of help you I don't didn't
 

00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.130
the kind of help you I don't didn't
actually see any other sort of power-ups

00:38:42.130 --> 00:38:42.140
actually see any other sort of power-ups
 

00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.720
actually see any other sort of power-ups
but I could be wrong and I didn't play

00:38:43.720 --> 00:38:43.730
but I could be wrong and I didn't play
 

00:38:43.730 --> 00:38:46.660
but I could be wrong and I didn't play
the game extensively but I did play

00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:46.670
the game extensively but I did play
 

00:38:46.670 --> 00:38:48.370
the game extensively but I did play
quite a bit enough to know that it

00:38:48.370 --> 00:38:48.380
quite a bit enough to know that it
 

00:38:48.380 --> 00:38:49.390
quite a bit enough to know that it
didn't wanna play it in regular mode

00:38:49.390 --> 00:38:49.400
didn't wanna play it in regular mode
 

00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:50.979
didn't wanna play it in regular mode
let's go back to like what stretch to

00:38:50.979 --> 00:38:50.989
let's go back to like what stretch to
 

00:38:50.989 --> 00:38:52.269
let's go back to like what stretch to
fill screen now actually looks like

00:38:52.269 --> 00:38:52.279
fill screen now actually looks like
 

00:38:52.279 --> 00:38:55.390
fill screen now actually looks like
right okay so this is a the performance

00:38:55.390 --> 00:38:55.400
right okay so this is a the performance
 

00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:56.829
right okay so this is a the performance
we get in stretch evil screen first of

00:38:56.829 --> 00:38:56.839
we get in stretch evil screen first of
 

00:38:56.839 --> 00:38:58.509
we get in stretch evil screen first of
all the graphics are beautiful it's just

00:38:58.509 --> 00:38:58.519
all the graphics are beautiful it's just
 

00:38:58.519 --> 00:39:00.670
all the graphics are beautiful it's just
like they're really really high res but

00:39:00.670 --> 00:39:00.680
like they're really really high res but
 

00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:04.539
like they're really really high res but
the problem is that the game just slows

00:39:04.539 --> 00:39:04.549
the problem is that the game just slows
 

00:39:04.549 --> 00:39:06.880
the problem is that the game just slows
down to like an unplayable level of

00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:06.890
down to like an unplayable level of
 

00:39:06.890 --> 00:39:09.819
down to like an unplayable level of
slowness so I'm off yeah and so

00:39:09.819 --> 00:39:09.829
slowness so I'm off yeah and so
 

00:39:09.829 --> 00:39:12.489
slowness so I'm off yeah and so
yeah why is that Dad okay why I have

00:39:12.489 --> 00:39:12.499
yeah why is that Dad okay why I have
 

00:39:12.499 --> 00:39:14.440
yeah why is that Dad okay why I have
some theories I think that so there's a

00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:14.450
some theories I think that so there's a
 

00:39:14.450 --> 00:39:15.699
some theories I think that so there's a
gradient that's drawn behind the

00:39:15.699 --> 00:39:15.709
gradient that's drawn behind the
 

00:39:15.709 --> 00:39:17.049
gradient that's drawn behind the
background a very subtle gradient oh

00:39:17.049 --> 00:39:17.059
background a very subtle gradient oh
 

00:39:17.059 --> 00:39:19.150
background a very subtle gradient oh
yeah is that they're drawing the

00:39:19.150 --> 00:39:19.160
yeah is that they're drawing the
 

00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:21.039
yeah is that they're drawing the
gradient in real time rather than

00:39:21.039 --> 00:39:21.049
gradient in real time rather than
 

00:39:21.049 --> 00:39:22.930
gradient in real time rather than
drawing it once in caching that's my

00:39:22.930 --> 00:39:22.940
drawing it once in caching that's my
 

00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:24.249
drawing it once in caching that's my
theory but I actually don't know the

00:39:24.249 --> 00:39:24.259
theory but I actually don't know the
 

00:39:24.259 --> 00:39:25.630
theory but I actually don't know the
answer to that another thing that would

00:39:25.630 --> 00:39:25.640
answer to that another thing that would
 

00:39:25.640 --> 00:39:26.920
answer to that another thing that would
be great would be to see a real tablet

00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:26.930
be great would be to see a real tablet
 

00:39:26.930 --> 00:39:29.349
be great would be to see a real tablet
layout for this game on that it has some

00:39:29.349 --> 00:39:29.359
layout for this game on that it has some
 

00:39:29.359 --> 00:39:31.779
layout for this game on that it has some
larger font sizes because you can see

00:39:31.779 --> 00:39:31.789
larger font sizes because you can see
 

00:39:31.789 --> 00:39:33.489
larger font sizes because you can see
that they oh there's like there's a

00:39:33.489 --> 00:39:33.499
that they oh there's like there's a
 

00:39:33.499 --> 00:39:34.569
that they oh there's like there's a
couple they're just unreasonable

00:39:34.569 --> 00:39:34.579
couple they're just unreasonable
 

00:39:34.579 --> 00:39:37.930
couple they're just unreasonable
readable yeah yeah on a floating device

00:39:37.930 --> 00:39:37.940
readable yeah yeah on a floating device
 

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.130
readable yeah yeah on a floating device
they're fine but on this device is

00:39:39.130 --> 00:39:39.140
they're fine but on this device is
 

00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:40.239
they're fine but on this device is
really really small and with the

00:39:40.239 --> 00:39:40.249
really really small and with the
 

00:39:40.249 --> 00:39:41.920
really really small and with the
beautiful high-res graphics that are

00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:41.930
beautiful high-res graphics that are
 

00:39:41.930 --> 00:39:43.150
beautiful high-res graphics that are
here you know that's what they was

00:39:43.150 --> 00:39:43.160
here you know that's what they was
 

00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.559
here you know that's what they was
easier guesses I didn't have a time to

00:39:44.559 --> 00:39:44.569
easier guesses I didn't have a time to
 

00:39:44.569 --> 00:39:46.239
easier guesses I didn't have a time to
really you know research extensively

00:39:46.239 --> 00:39:46.249
really you know research extensively
 

00:39:46.249 --> 00:39:49.449
really you know research extensively
what I do know is that even um turning

00:39:49.449 --> 00:39:49.459
what I do know is that even um turning
 

00:39:49.459 --> 00:39:51.279
what I do know is that even um turning
on hardware acceleration for this

00:39:51.279 --> 00:39:51.289
on hardware acceleration for this
 

00:39:51.289 --> 00:39:53.049
on hardware acceleration for this
forcing and did not actually help the

00:39:53.049 --> 00:39:53.059
forcing and did not actually help the
 

00:39:53.059 --> 00:39:54.729
forcing and did not actually help the
performance much it helped it a little

00:39:54.729 --> 00:39:54.739
performance much it helped it a little
 

00:39:54.739 --> 00:39:59.349
performance much it helped it a little
bit so but heard it in other ways so so

00:39:59.349 --> 00:39:59.359
bit so but heard it in other ways so so
 

00:39:59.359 --> 00:39:59.920
bit so but heard it in other ways so so
there's something there's something

00:39:59.920 --> 00:39:59.930
there's something there's something
 

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:01.779
there's something there's something
that's going on that's clearly just

00:40:01.779 --> 00:40:01.789
that's going on that's clearly just
 

00:40:01.789 --> 00:40:03.699
that's going on that's clearly just
drawing like crazy and calculating like

00:40:03.699 --> 00:40:03.709
drawing like crazy and calculating like
 

00:40:03.709 --> 00:40:04.900
drawing like crazy and calculating like
crazy especially on this being a

00:40:04.900 --> 00:40:04.910
crazy especially on this being a
 

00:40:04.910 --> 00:40:06.160
crazy especially on this being a
transformer prime this is actually a

00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:06.170
transformer prime this is actually a
 

00:40:06.170 --> 00:40:07.989
transformer prime this is actually a
pretty fast device yes this is one of

00:40:07.989 --> 00:40:07.999
pretty fast device yes this is one of
 

00:40:07.999 --> 00:40:09.699
pretty fast device yes this is one of
those places where you might want to do

00:40:09.699 --> 00:40:09.709
those places where you might want to do
 

00:40:09.709 --> 00:40:12.190
those places where you might want to do
a little profiling yeah so so what I

00:40:12.190 --> 00:40:12.200
a little profiling yeah so so what I
 

00:40:12.200 --> 00:40:14.199
a little profiling yeah so so what I
usually do is use there's there's

00:40:14.199 --> 00:40:14.209
usually do is use there's there's
 

00:40:14.209 --> 00:40:15.939
usually do is use there's there's
actually a really cool thing you can use

00:40:15.939 --> 00:40:15.949
actually a really cool thing you can use
 

00:40:15.949 --> 00:40:19.180
actually a really cool thing you can use
called traceview inside of Android and

00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:19.190
called traceview inside of Android and
 

00:40:19.190 --> 00:40:21.130
called traceview inside of Android and
actually will show you all of your view

00:40:21.130 --> 00:40:21.140
actually will show you all of your view
 

00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:22.719
actually will show you all of your view
drawing and it's very very cool you just

00:40:22.719 --> 00:40:22.729
drawing and it's very very cool you just
 

00:40:22.729 --> 00:40:24.789
drawing and it's very very cool you just
turn it on and then it starts showing

00:40:24.789 --> 00:40:24.799
turn it on and then it starts showing
 

00:40:24.799 --> 00:40:26.289
turn it on and then it starts showing
you all of the draw calls that go

00:40:26.289 --> 00:40:26.299
you all of the draw calls that go
 

00:40:26.299 --> 00:40:27.489
you all of the draw calls that go
through and you can turn it off so

00:40:27.489 --> 00:40:27.499
through and you can turn it off so
 

00:40:27.499 --> 00:40:29.170
through and you can turn it off so
that's what that's what i would do is i

00:40:29.170 --> 00:40:29.180
that's what that's what i would do is i
 

00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:30.370
that's what that's what i would do is i
think this is done with our layout

00:40:30.370 --> 00:40:30.380
think this is done with our layout
 

00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:32.529
think this is done with our layout
system but i'm not sure you know that so

00:40:32.529 --> 00:40:32.539
system but i'm not sure you know that so
 

00:40:32.539 --> 00:40:34.569
system but i'm not sure you know that so
but if that's if that's what's going on

00:40:34.569 --> 00:40:34.579
but if that's if that's what's going on
 

00:40:34.579 --> 00:40:36.039
but if that's if that's what's going on
that may help a lot and you can look at

00:40:36.039 --> 00:40:36.049
that may help a lot and you can look at
 

00:40:36.049 --> 00:40:37.630
that may help a lot and you can look at
the timing of each one of your draws and

00:40:37.630 --> 00:40:37.640
the timing of each one of your draws and
 

00:40:37.640 --> 00:40:39.099
the timing of each one of your draws and
see how long it's taking so that that

00:40:39.099 --> 00:40:39.109
see how long it's taking so that that
 

00:40:39.109 --> 00:40:41.529
see how long it's taking so that that
would be my recommendation but other

00:40:41.529 --> 00:40:41.539
would be my recommendation but other
 

00:40:41.539 --> 00:40:42.969
would be my recommendation but other
than that I really like the game again

00:40:42.969 --> 00:40:42.979
than that I really like the game again
 

00:40:42.979 --> 00:40:44.349
than that I really like the game again
you know back key navigation is really

00:40:44.349 --> 00:40:44.359
you know back key navigation is really
 

00:40:44.359 --> 00:40:45.609
you know back key navigation is really
really important on this game actually

00:40:45.609 --> 00:40:45.619
really important on this game actually
 

00:40:45.619 --> 00:40:48.309
really important on this game actually
pauses when you go to the lock screen so

00:40:48.309 --> 00:40:48.319
pauses when you go to the lock screen so
 

00:40:48.319 --> 00:40:49.809
pauses when you go to the lock screen so
which is act which is a nice nice thing

00:40:49.809 --> 00:40:49.819
which is act which is a nice nice thing
 

00:40:49.819 --> 00:40:51.670
which is act which is a nice nice thing
for game to do it also automatically

00:40:51.670 --> 00:40:51.680
for game to do it also automatically
 

00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.109
for game to do it also automatically
eliminates the sound on lock screen

00:40:53.109 --> 00:40:53.119
eliminates the sound on lock screen
 

00:40:53.119 --> 00:40:54.640
eliminates the sound on lock screen
issue since it doesn't place out when

00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:54.650
issue since it doesn't place out when
 

00:40:54.650 --> 00:40:57.130
issue since it doesn't place out when
it's locked so another young sitting

00:40:57.130 --> 00:40:57.140
it's locked so another young sitting
 

00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:58.329
it's locked so another young sitting
place down with his paw what it's paused

00:40:58.329 --> 00:40:58.339
place down with his paw what it's paused
 

00:40:58.339 --> 00:40:59.650
place down with his paw what it's paused
as right all right when its paws that's

00:40:59.650 --> 00:40:59.660
as right all right when its paws that's
 

00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.839
as right all right when its paws that's
what I meant to say yeah and that is

00:41:01.839 --> 00:41:01.849
what I meant to say yeah and that is
 

00:41:01.849 --> 00:41:03.339
what I meant to say yeah and that is
always our recommendation is you should

00:41:03.339 --> 00:41:03.349
always our recommendation is you should
 

00:41:03.349 --> 00:41:05.289
always our recommendation is you should
pause the you know when you get a non

00:41:05.289 --> 00:41:05.299
pause the you know when you get a non
 

00:41:05.299 --> 00:41:08.109
pause the you know when you get a non
cause you should pause the game and stop

00:41:08.109 --> 00:41:08.119
cause you should pause the game and stop
 

00:41:08.119 --> 00:41:10.059
cause you should pause the game and stop
the music and then wait for the user to

00:41:10.059 --> 00:41:10.069
the music and then wait for the user to
 

00:41:10.069 --> 00:41:12.939
the music and then wait for the user to
restart it that way you you just dodged

00:41:12.939 --> 00:41:12.949
restart it that way you you just dodged
 

00:41:12.949 --> 00:41:15.969
restart it that way you you just dodged
all of the issues about is the phone on

00:41:15.969 --> 00:41:15.979
all of the issues about is the phone on
 

00:41:15.979 --> 00:41:18.339
all of the issues about is the phone on
is it you know is it in the right state

00:41:18.339 --> 00:41:18.349
is it you know is it in the right state
 

00:41:18.349 --> 00:41:20.769
is it you know is it in the right state
it has a lock screen gone away just get

00:41:20.769 --> 00:41:20.779
it has a lock screen gone away just get
 

00:41:20.779 --> 00:41:22.410
it has a lock screen gone away just get
rid of all and I actually think it's

00:41:22.410 --> 00:41:22.420
rid of all and I actually think it's
 

00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:23.789
rid of all and I actually think it's
differently from a user experience point

00:41:23.789 --> 00:41:23.799
differently from a user experience point
 

00:41:23.799 --> 00:41:25.380
differently from a user experience point
it's really good because even if even if

00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:25.390
it's really good because even if even if
 

00:41:25.390 --> 00:41:27.900
it's really good because even if even if
I now go and I and I've unlocked the

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:27.910
I now go and I and I've unlocked the
 

00:41:27.910 --> 00:41:30.210
I now go and I and I've unlocked the
phone and I go back I don't have music

00:41:30.210 --> 00:41:30.220
phone and I go back I don't have music
 

00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:31.799
phone and I go back I don't have music
that's immediately blaring at me you

00:41:31.799 --> 00:41:31.809
that's immediately blaring at me you
 

00:41:31.809 --> 00:41:33.359
that's immediately blaring at me you
know that which is what I think I think

00:41:33.359 --> 00:41:33.369
know that which is what I think I think
 

00:41:33.369 --> 00:41:34.140
know that which is what I think I think
so I actually really like this

00:41:34.140 --> 00:41:34.150
so I actually really like this
 

00:41:34.150 --> 00:41:36.120
so I actually really like this
experience yet you always got to think

00:41:36.120 --> 00:41:36.130
experience yet you always got to think
 

00:41:36.130 --> 00:41:39.329
experience yet you always got to think
about the you know the user that has

00:41:39.329 --> 00:41:39.339
about the you know the user that has
 

00:41:39.339 --> 00:41:41.130
about the you know the user that has
been playing the game at the bus stop

00:41:41.130 --> 00:41:41.140
been playing the game at the bus stop
 

00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.170
been playing the game at the bus stop
and now they've gotten to work and they

00:41:43.170 --> 00:41:43.180
and now they've gotten to work and they
 

00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:45.120
and now they've gotten to work and they
pull the the device out of their pocket

00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:45.130
pull the the device out of their pocket
 

00:41:45.130 --> 00:41:47.339
pull the the device out of their pocket
and unlock it and what's going to happen

00:41:47.339 --> 00:41:47.349
and unlock it and what's going to happen
 

00:41:47.349 --> 00:41:49.289
and unlock it and what's going to happen
is are they going to get music is going

00:41:49.289 --> 00:41:49.299
is are they going to get music is going
 

00:41:49.299 --> 00:41:50.250
is are they going to get music is going
to be obvious they're playing video

00:41:50.250 --> 00:41:50.260
to be obvious they're playing video
 

00:41:50.260 --> 00:41:52.710
to be obvious they're playing video
games or is it the phone just going to

00:41:52.710 --> 00:41:52.720
games or is it the phone just going to
 

00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:54.839
games or is it the phone just going to
be in a state where where it's quiet so

00:41:54.839 --> 00:41:54.849
be in a state where where it's quiet so
 

00:41:54.849 --> 00:41:56.339
be in a state where where it's quiet so
this is actually one of the 21 of the

00:41:56.339 --> 00:41:56.349
this is actually one of the 21 of the
 

00:41:56.349 --> 00:41:57.599
this is actually one of the 21 of the
tricky things with layout view then I'll

00:41:57.599 --> 00:41:57.609
tricky things with layout view then I'll
 

00:41:57.609 --> 00:42:00.420
tricky things with layout view then I'll
show you is is it if you're doing the

00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:00.430
show you is is it if you're doing the
 

00:42:00.430 --> 00:42:01.740
show you is is it if you're doing the
kind of thing or you have a bitmap and

00:42:01.740 --> 00:42:01.750
kind of thing or you have a bitmap and
 

00:42:01.750 --> 00:42:04.230
kind of thing or you have a bitmap and
you're stretching it it's difficult to

00:42:04.230 --> 00:42:04.240
you're stretching it it's difficult to
 

00:42:04.240 --> 00:42:06.809
you're stretching it it's difficult to
set to say like maximum stretch you know

00:42:06.809 --> 00:42:06.819
set to say like maximum stretch you know
 

00:42:06.819 --> 00:42:08.130
set to say like maximum stretch you know
you end up with these in these guineas

00:42:08.130 --> 00:42:08.140
you end up with these in these guineas
 

00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:09.750
you end up with these in these guineas
in this particular game where we're

00:42:09.750 --> 00:42:09.760
in this particular game where we're
 

00:42:09.760 --> 00:42:10.770
in this particular game where we're
actually what you'd really like to see

00:42:10.770 --> 00:42:10.780
actually what you'd really like to see
 

00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.599
actually what you'd really like to see
is that elemental jewels title you know

00:42:12.599 --> 00:42:12.609
is that elemental jewels title you know
 

00:42:12.609 --> 00:42:14.430
is that elemental jewels title you know
doubled in size but we're only but we're

00:42:14.430 --> 00:42:14.440
doubled in size but we're only but we're
 

00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:16.109
doubled in size but we're only but we're
doing like basically you're setting but

00:42:16.109 --> 00:42:16.119
doing like basically you're setting but
 

00:42:16.119 --> 00:42:19.010
doing like basically you're setting but
the that particular layout to being just

00:42:19.010 --> 00:42:19.020
the that particular layout to being just
 

00:42:19.020 --> 00:42:22.289
the that particular layout to being just
fill parent and so it's going to and and

00:42:22.289 --> 00:42:22.299
fill parent and so it's going to and and
 

00:42:22.299 --> 00:42:23.609
fill parent and so it's going to and and
yet it's going to do it's going it's

00:42:23.609 --> 00:42:23.619
yet it's going to do it's going it's
 

00:42:23.619 --> 00:42:25.049
yet it's going to do it's going it's
going to be the height of the content

00:42:25.049 --> 00:42:25.059
going to be the height of the content
 

00:42:25.059 --> 00:42:26.250
going to be the height of the content
which is usually it's usually fill

00:42:26.250 --> 00:42:26.260
which is usually it's usually fill
 

00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:28.020
which is usually it's usually fill
parent and web content so you could do a

00:42:28.020 --> 00:42:28.030
parent and web content so you could do a
 

00:42:28.030 --> 00:42:28.859
parent and web content so you could do a
couple things that you could actually

00:42:28.859 --> 00:42:28.869
couple things that you could actually
 

00:42:28.869 --> 00:42:32.789
couple things that you could actually
set it you set it to two not wrap to

00:42:32.789 --> 00:42:32.799
set it you set it to two not wrap to
 

00:42:32.799 --> 00:42:35.430
set it you set it to two not wrap to
wrap content but set the maintain aspect

00:42:35.430 --> 00:42:35.440
wrap content but set the maintain aspect
 

00:42:35.440 --> 00:42:37.079
wrap content but set the maintain aspect
ratio flag which would look a little bit

00:42:37.079 --> 00:42:37.089
ratio flag which would look a little bit
 

00:42:37.089 --> 00:42:39.120
ratio flag which would look a little bit
better here on the bit map view that's

00:42:39.120 --> 00:42:39.130
better here on the bit map view that's
 

00:42:39.130 --> 00:42:40.890
better here on the bit map view that's
there assuming that's what it is you

00:42:40.890 --> 00:42:40.900
there assuming that's what it is you
 

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.030
there assuming that's what it is you
know it's hard to tell when your whether

00:42:42.030 --> 00:42:42.040
know it's hard to tell when your whether
 

00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:43.589
know it's hard to tell when your whether
this is a real list or not but that's my

00:42:43.589 --> 00:42:43.599
this is a real list or not but that's my
 

00:42:43.599 --> 00:42:46.890
this is a real list or not but that's my
theory and and also again you know

00:42:46.890 --> 00:42:46.900
theory and and also again you know
 

00:42:46.900 --> 00:42:48.390
theory and and also again you know
justjust you see when you're when you're

00:42:48.390 --> 00:42:48.400
justjust you see when you're when you're
 

00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.160
justjust you see when you're when you're
on a tablet obviously this looks really

00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:50.170
on a tablet obviously this looks really
 

00:42:50.170 --> 00:42:52.650
on a tablet obviously this looks really
really small and having having some

00:42:52.650 --> 00:42:52.660
really small and having having some
 

00:42:52.660 --> 00:42:54.510
really small and having having some
large font sizes and a different layout

00:42:54.510 --> 00:42:54.520
large font sizes and a different layout
 

00:42:54.520 --> 00:42:56.490
large font sizes and a different layout
would really help it either way you know

00:42:56.490 --> 00:42:56.500
would really help it either way you know
 

00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:57.750
would really help it either way you know
there's really no excuse for this we

00:42:57.750 --> 00:42:57.760
there's really no excuse for this we
 

00:42:57.760 --> 00:42:59.010
there's really no excuse for this we
talked to a lot of people that are like

00:42:59.010 --> 00:42:59.020
talked to a lot of people that are like
 

00:42:59.020 --> 00:43:01.170
talked to a lot of people that are like
hey you know we we found just like the

00:43:01.170 --> 00:43:01.180
hey you know we we found just like the
 

00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:02.609
hey you know we we found just like the
left there right you know we had one

00:43:02.609 --> 00:43:02.619
left there right you know we had one
 

00:43:02.619 --> 00:43:04.230
left there right you know we had one
device to test on now we've got like

00:43:04.230 --> 00:43:04.240
device to test on now we've got like
 

00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.880
device to test on now we've got like
three or four but we're still going to

00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:05.890
three or four but we're still going to
 

00:43:05.890 --> 00:43:08.280
three or four but we're still going to
find these you know odd devices that

00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:08.290
find these you know odd devices that
 

00:43:08.290 --> 00:43:10.109
find these you know odd devices that
just don't meet our expectations but

00:43:10.109 --> 00:43:10.119
just don't meet our expectations but
 

00:43:10.119 --> 00:43:12.500
just don't meet our expectations but
this sort of layout issue is not a

00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:12.510
this sort of layout issue is not a
 

00:43:12.510 --> 00:43:16.109
this sort of layout issue is not a
device dependent issue it's dependent on

00:43:16.109 --> 00:43:16.119
device dependent issue it's dependent on
 

00:43:16.119 --> 00:43:19.470
device dependent issue it's dependent on
the screen size DPI the the OS version

need a separate layup you might just

00:43:45.360 --> 00:43:45.370
need a separate layup you might just
 

00:43:45.370 --> 00:43:47.610
need a separate layup you might just
need some different sizes like you can

00:43:47.610 --> 00:43:47.620
need some different sizes like you can
 

00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.050

you can have you can have different size

00:43:49.050 --> 00:43:49.060
you can have you can have different size
 

00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:50.610
you can have you can have different size
different kind of minimum sizes for

different kind of minimum sizes for
 

00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:54.170

and and that might be enough for this

00:43:58.920 --> 00:43:58.930
and and that might be enough for this
 

00:43:58.930 --> 00:44:00.690
and and that might be enough for this
kind of game to make just fix all these

00:44:00.690 --> 00:44:00.700
kind of game to make just fix all these
 

00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:01.980
kind of game to make just fix all these
things and make it look fairly smooth

00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:01.990
things and make it look fairly smooth
 

00:44:01.990 --> 00:44:04.350
things and make it look fairly smooth
across a wide variety of screen sizes so

00:44:04.350 --> 00:44:04.360
across a wide variety of screen sizes so
 

00:44:04.360 --> 00:44:05.730
across a wide variety of screen sizes so
it can be as simple as just literally

00:44:05.730 --> 00:44:05.740
it can be as simple as just literally
 

00:44:05.740 --> 00:44:08.220
it can be as simple as just literally
adding a couple of constants in you know

00:44:08.220 --> 00:44:08.230
adding a couple of constants in you know
 

00:44:08.230 --> 00:44:10.320
adding a couple of constants in you know
that say oh we're on a large screen

00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:10.330
that say oh we're on a large screen
 

00:44:10.330 --> 00:44:14.580
that say oh we're on a large screen
device therefore I want that the size of

00:44:14.580 --> 00:44:14.590
device therefore I want that the size of
 

00:44:14.590 --> 00:44:17.070
device therefore I want that the size of
my list item to be twice the size of

00:44:17.070 --> 00:44:17.080
my list item to be twice the size of
 

00:44:17.080 --> 00:44:19.500
my list item to be twice the size of
this default text yeah but you know the

00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:19.510
this default text yeah but you know the
 

00:44:19.510 --> 00:44:20.820
this default text yeah but you know the
fixes are simple the important thing is

00:44:20.820 --> 00:44:20.830
fixes are simple the important thing is
 

00:44:20.830 --> 00:44:22.980
fixes are simple the important thing is
just that you've done the testing you

00:44:22.980 --> 00:44:22.990
just that you've done the testing you
 

00:44:22.990 --> 00:44:26.580
just that you've done the testing you
make sure that you've seen your layout

00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:26.590
make sure that you've seen your layout
 

00:44:26.590 --> 00:44:28.200
make sure that you've seen your layout
at different sizes and I know you know

00:44:28.200 --> 00:44:28.210
at different sizes and I know you know
 

00:44:28.210 --> 00:44:29.850
at different sizes and I know you know
every time I do a layout this kind of

00:44:29.850 --> 00:44:29.860
every time I do a layout this kind of
 

00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:34.080
every time I do a layout this kind of
opinion it's not fun but at the same

00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:34.090
opinion it's not fun but at the same
 

00:44:34.090 --> 00:44:36.720
opinion it's not fun but at the same
time neither is finding out that you've

00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:36.730
time neither is finding out that you've
 

00:44:36.730 --> 00:44:38.520
time neither is finding out that you've
got a one-star review because you're

00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:38.530
got a one-star review because you're
 

00:44:38.530 --> 00:44:41.250
got a one-star review because you're
you're applic like like crap on some

00:44:41.250 --> 00:44:41.260
you're applic like like crap on some
 

00:44:41.260 --> 00:44:43.380
you're applic like like crap on some
device yeah anyway and the only way to

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:43.390
device yeah anyway and the only way to
 

00:44:43.390 --> 00:44:44.610
device yeah anyway and the only way to
really test these kind of fill rate

00:44:44.610 --> 00:44:44.620
really test these kind of fill rate
 

00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:47.070
really test these kind of fill rate
issues is to is usually usually you'll

00:44:47.070 --> 00:44:47.080
issues is to is usually usually you'll
 

00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:48.390
issues is to is usually usually you'll
see them in the emulator first of all I

00:44:48.390 --> 00:44:48.400
see them in the emulator first of all I
 

00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:49.800
see them in the emulator first of all I
mean this kind of fill rate that were

00:44:49.800 --> 00:44:49.810
mean this kind of fill rate that were
 

00:44:49.810 --> 00:44:51.000
mean this kind of fill rate that were
issue that we're seeing here which I

00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:51.010
issue that we're seeing here which I
 

00:44:51.010 --> 00:44:52.290
issue that we're seeing here which I
suspect no we're talking about the

00:44:52.290 --> 00:44:52.300
suspect no we're talking about the
 

00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:53.790
suspect no we're talking about the
performance issues format yeah you

00:44:53.790 --> 00:44:53.800
performance issues format yeah you
 

00:44:53.800 --> 00:44:55.260
performance issues format yeah you
probably will see that in the emulator

00:44:55.260 --> 00:44:55.270
probably will see that in the emulator
 

00:44:55.270 --> 00:44:56.460
probably will see that in the emulator
if you choose a large screen I mean

00:44:56.460 --> 00:44:56.470
if you choose a large screen I mean
 

00:44:56.470 --> 00:44:57.570
if you choose a large screen I mean
that's that's because the emulator is

00:44:57.570 --> 00:44:57.580
that's that's because the emulator is
 

00:44:57.580 --> 00:44:59.280
that's that's because the emulator is
really really sensitive to those kinds

00:44:59.280 --> 00:44:59.290
really really sensitive to those kinds
 

00:44:59.290 --> 00:45:00.480
really really sensitive to those kinds
of issues because it's running an

00:45:00.480 --> 00:45:00.490
of issues because it's running an
 

00:45:00.490 --> 00:45:03.000
of issues because it's running an
emulation of our compositing system on

00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:03.010
emulation of our compositing system on
 

00:45:03.010 --> 00:45:04.800
emulation of our compositing system on
top of an emulation of OpenGL so you'll

00:45:04.800 --> 00:45:04.810
top of an emulation of OpenGL so you'll
 

00:45:04.810 --> 00:45:06.510
top of an emulation of OpenGL so you'll
you'll see usually use the frame rate

00:45:06.510 --> 00:45:06.520
you'll see usually use the frame rate
 

00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:08.100
you'll see usually use the frame rate
issues really really quickly unless

00:45:08.100 --> 00:45:08.110
issues really really quickly unless
 

00:45:08.110 --> 00:45:09.390
issues really really quickly unless
you're running the latest version or

00:45:09.390 --> 00:45:09.400
you're running the latest version or
 

00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:10.640
you're running the latest version or
emulator that's what you're going to see

00:45:10.640 --> 00:45:10.650
emulator that's what you're going to see
 

00:45:10.650 --> 00:45:15.360
emulator that's what you're going to see
so let's go on to the next title we're

00:45:15.360 --> 00:45:15.370
so let's go on to the next title we're
 

00:45:15.370 --> 00:45:17.400
so let's go on to the next title we're
almost done here so we've got a yeah

00:45:17.400 --> 00:45:17.410
almost done here so we've got a yeah
 

00:45:17.410 --> 00:45:18.600
almost done here so we've got a yeah
it's time for the lightning round it's

00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:18.610
it's time for the lightning round it's
 

00:45:18.610 --> 00:45:19.680
it's time for the lightning round it's
time for the line Aaron so you got spray

00:45:19.680 --> 00:45:19.690
time for the line Aaron so you got spray
 

00:45:19.690 --> 00:45:21.180
time for the line Aaron so you got spray
the wall and spray the wall I'm so

00:45:21.180 --> 00:45:21.190
the wall and spray the wall I'm so
 

00:45:21.190 --> 00:45:22.820
the wall and spray the wall I'm so
impressed that you got this to work huh

thing about this was actually this is so

00:46:06.349 --> 00:46:06.359
thing about this was actually this is so
 

00:46:06.359 --> 00:46:08.180
thing about this was actually this is so
cool but from an interface perspective I

00:46:08.180 --> 00:46:08.190
cool but from an interface perspective I
 

00:46:08.190 --> 00:46:09.589
cool but from an interface perspective I
just thought that I'd be able to hit the

00:46:09.589 --> 00:46:09.599
just thought that I'd be able to hit the
 

00:46:09.599 --> 00:46:10.910
just thought that I'd be able to hit the
spray can and then spray on the wall

00:46:10.910 --> 00:46:10.920
spray can and then spray on the wall
 

00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:12.769
spray can and then spray on the wall
right is it feels like such a missed

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:12.779
right is it feels like such a missed
 

00:46:12.779 --> 00:46:14.510
right is it feels like such a missed
opportunity and instead the way you

00:46:14.510 --> 00:46:14.520
opportunity and instead the way you
 

00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:16.279
opportunity and instead the way you
actually control it is you actually move

00:46:16.279 --> 00:46:16.289
actually control it is you actually move
 

00:46:16.289 --> 00:46:18.049
actually control it is you actually move
it like it was a joystick and then this

00:46:18.049 --> 00:46:18.059
it like it was a joystick and then this
 

00:46:18.059 --> 00:46:19.549
it like it was a joystick and then this
work here allows you to allows you to

00:46:19.549 --> 00:46:19.559
work here allows you to allows you to
 

00:46:19.559 --> 00:46:21.529
work here allows you to allows you to
control the sprang so you actually can

00:46:21.529 --> 00:46:21.539
control the sprang so you actually can
 

00:46:21.539 --> 00:46:23.029
control the sprang so you actually can
spray it's like a dual stigma like a

00:46:23.029 --> 00:46:23.039

switch back to the camera Trevor I just

00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:31.710
switch back to the camera Trevor I just
 

00:46:31.710 --> 00:46:34.430
switch back to the camera Trevor I just
want to show this really quick if you

00:46:34.430 --> 00:46:34.440
want to show this really quick if you
 

00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.079
want to show this really quick if you
can just get the cam view on the device

00:46:36.079 --> 00:46:36.089
can just get the cam view on the device

so the big broadcast there's two

00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:37.650
so the big broadcast there's two
 

00:46:37.650 --> 00:46:40.819
so the big broadcast there's two
problems yeah these this is the entire

00:46:40.819 --> 00:46:40.829
problems yeah these this is the entire
 

00:46:40.829 --> 00:46:43.819
problems yeah these this is the entire
range of the spraying you know that that

00:46:43.819 --> 00:46:43.829
range of the spraying you know that that
 

00:46:43.829 --> 00:46:45.319
range of the spraying you know that that
you know a lot of times we see things

00:46:45.319 --> 00:46:45.329
you know a lot of times we see things
 

00:46:45.329 --> 00:46:47.180
you know a lot of times we see things
that are way too big here and that's a

00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:47.190
that are way too big here and that's a
 

00:46:47.190 --> 00:46:49.460
that are way too big here and that's a
problem but in this case Wow way too

00:46:49.460 --> 00:46:49.470
problem but in this case Wow way too
 

00:46:49.470 --> 00:46:51.319
problem but in this case Wow way too
small well the problem is actually I

00:46:51.319 --> 00:46:51.329
small well the problem is actually I
 

00:46:51.329 --> 00:46:53.750
small well the problem is actually I
think that it's the right it's the right

00:46:53.750 --> 00:46:53.760
think that it's the right it's the right
 

00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.390
think that it's the right it's the right
size because it's actually size based on

00:46:56.390 --> 00:46:56.400
size because it's actually size based on
 

00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:57.769
size because it's actually size based on
the DPI like I don't actually mind this

00:46:57.769 --> 00:46:57.779
the DPI like I don't actually mind this
 

00:46:57.779 --> 00:46:59.120
the DPI like I don't actually mind this
Iseman the big promise is to right at

00:46:59.120 --> 00:46:59.130
Iseman the big promise is to right at
 

00:46:59.130 --> 00:47:02.420
Iseman the big promise is to right at
the edge and so if I go like this and I

00:47:02.420 --> 00:47:02.430
the edge and so if I go like this and I
 

00:47:02.430 --> 00:47:04.640
the edge and so if I go like this and I
pull off of it all of a sudden it loses

00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:04.650
pull off of it all of a sudden it loses
 

00:47:04.650 --> 00:47:06.230
pull off of it all of a sudden it loses
the fact that I'm trying to drag and it

00:47:06.230 --> 00:47:06.240
the fact that I'm trying to drag and it
 

00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:07.519
the fact that I'm trying to drag and it
doesn't have to but you've also got some

00:47:07.519 --> 00:47:07.529
doesn't have to but you've also got some
 

00:47:07.529 --> 00:47:12.079
doesn't have to but you've also got some
serious gimbal lock up there yeah so you

00:47:12.079 --> 00:47:12.089
serious gimbal lock up there yeah so you
 

00:47:12.089 --> 00:47:13.970
serious gimbal lock up there yeah so you
see what i mean so that's that's uh ya

00:47:13.970 --> 00:47:13.980
see what i mean so that's that's uh ya
 

00:47:13.980 --> 00:47:15.500
see what i mean so that's that's uh ya
know guy i ended up making called

00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:15.510
know guy i ended up making called
 

00:47:15.510 --> 00:47:19.819
know guy i ended up making called
quaternions look them up so you know but

00:47:19.819 --> 00:47:19.829
quaternions look them up so you know but
 

00:47:19.829 --> 00:47:20.900
quaternions look them up so you know but
other than that you know the gate i

00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:20.910
other than that you know the gate i
 

00:47:20.910 --> 00:47:22.039
other than that you know the gate i
think it's really cool concept i think

00:47:22.039 --> 00:47:22.049
think it's really cool concept i think
 

00:47:22.049 --> 00:47:24.140
think it's really cool concept i think
really the control is is was the issue

00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:24.150
really the control is is was the issue
 

00:47:24.150 --> 00:47:26.029
really the control is is was the issue
and you see like especially if the other

00:47:26.029 --> 00:47:26.039
and you see like especially if the other
 

00:47:26.039 --> 00:47:27.019
and you see like especially if the other
thing is if i'm sorry if i'm actually

00:47:27.019 --> 00:47:27.029
thing is if i'm sorry if i'm actually
 

00:47:27.029 --> 00:47:30.440
thing is if i'm sorry if i'm actually
going off the screen here you know it's

00:47:30.440 --> 00:47:30.450
going off the screen here you know it's
 

00:47:30.450 --> 00:47:31.880
going off the screen here you know it's
a question of what i really want to do

00:47:31.880 --> 00:47:31.890
a question of what i really want to do
 

00:47:31.890 --> 00:47:33.769
a question of what i really want to do
like if I'm holding it like this do I

00:47:33.769 --> 00:47:33.779
like if I'm holding it like this do I
 

00:47:33.779 --> 00:47:35.120
like if I'm holding it like this do I
want to note that I've gone off the

00:47:35.120 --> 00:47:35.130
want to note that I've gone off the
 

00:47:35.130 --> 00:47:36.260
want to note that I've gone off the
screen and leave it in that current

00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:36.270
screen and leave it in that current
 

00:47:36.270 --> 00:47:39.170
screen and leave it in that current
place or not I don't know but but this

00:47:39.170 --> 00:47:39.180
place or not I don't know but but this
 

00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.630
place or not I don't know but but this
is certainly the experience is pretty

00:47:41.630 --> 00:47:41.640
is certainly the experience is pretty
 

00:47:41.640 --> 00:47:43.309
is certainly the experience is pretty
bad from a usability perspective also

00:47:43.309 --> 00:47:43.319
bad from a usability perspective also
 

00:47:43.319 --> 00:47:44.900
bad from a usability perspective also
you can well and again I always catch my

00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:44.910
you can well and again I always catch my
 

00:47:44.910 --> 00:47:46.549
you can well and again I always catch my
little my tap see it didn't need to be

00:47:46.549 --> 00:47:46.559
little my tap see it didn't need to be
 

00:47:46.559 --> 00:47:48.859
little my tap see it didn't need to be
that way or I don't know I know it's a

00:47:48.859 --> 00:47:48.869
that way or I don't know I know it's a
 

00:47:48.869 --> 00:47:50.510
that way or I don't know I know it's a
lot of work I mean there's work involved

00:47:50.510 --> 00:47:50.520
lot of work I mean there's work involved
 

00:47:50.520 --> 00:47:52.519
lot of work I mean there's work involved
in actually you know saying I've touch

00:47:52.519 --> 00:47:52.529
in actually you know saying I've touch
 

00:47:52.529 --> 00:47:54.049
in actually you know saying I've touch
the screen here sure sure know what is

00:47:54.049 --> 00:47:54.059
the screen here sure sure know what is
 

00:47:54.059 --> 00:47:55.490
the screen here sure sure know what is
all the wall bin it's a map you know

00:47:55.490 --> 00:47:55.500
all the wall bin it's a map you know
 

00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:57.170
all the wall bin it's a map you know
that's it that's Lea you gotta do a raid

00:47:57.170 --> 00:47:57.180
that's it that's Lea you gotta do a raid
 

00:47:57.180 --> 00:47:58.519
that's it that's Lea you gotta do a raid
phrase yeah I mean it's you know it's

00:47:58.519 --> 00:47:58.529
phrase yeah I mean it's you know it's
 

00:47:58.529 --> 00:48:00.380
phrase yeah I mean it's you know it's
and that's the only two that's I would

00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:00.390
and that's the only two that's I would
 

00:48:00.390 --> 00:48:01.550
and that's the only two that's I would
say that's really but you know

00:48:01.550 --> 00:48:01.560
say that's really but you know
 

00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:02.480
say that's really but you know
he's probably doing the right choice

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:02.490
he's probably doing the right choice
 

00:48:02.490 --> 00:48:04.730
he's probably doing the right choice
anyway to figure out where to put the

00:48:04.730 --> 00:48:04.740
anyway to figure out where to put the
 

00:48:04.740 --> 00:48:06.350
anyway to figure out where to put the
pain to the texture that's true he's got

00:48:06.350 --> 00:48:06.360
pain to the texture that's true he's got
 

00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:07.730
pain to the texture that's true he's got
this point here he knows he has to know

00:48:07.730 --> 00:48:07.740
this point here he knows he has to know
 

00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:08.930
this point here he knows he has to know
where that point is so that means if he

00:48:08.930 --> 00:48:08.940
where that point is so that means if he
 

00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:10.010
where that point is so that means if he
knows where this point is he probably

00:48:10.010 --> 00:48:10.020
knows where this point is he probably
 

00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:11.780
knows where this point is he probably
should be able to translate here and do

00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:11.790
should be able to translate here and do
 

00:48:11.790 --> 00:48:13.400
should be able to translate here and do
that point over there with the same map

00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:13.410
that point over there with the same map
 

00:48:13.410 --> 00:48:15.200
that point over there with the same map
well plus it's it's a really trivial

00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:15.210
well plus it's it's a really trivial
 

00:48:15.210 --> 00:48:16.730
well plus it's it's a really trivial
piece of map that's right I was right

00:48:16.730 --> 00:48:16.740
piece of map that's right I was right
 

00:48:16.740 --> 00:48:19.310
piece of map that's right I was right
yeah it's not difficult it's just yeah

00:48:19.310 --> 00:48:19.320
yeah it's not difficult it's just yeah
 

00:48:19.320 --> 00:48:22.190
yeah it's not difficult it's just yeah
and just have to do it yeah so I would

00:48:22.190 --> 00:48:22.200
and just have to do it yeah so I would
 

00:48:22.200 --> 00:48:25.490
and just have to do it yeah so I would
say really interesting concept it just

00:48:25.490 --> 00:48:25.500
say really interesting concept it just
 

00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:26.960
say really interesting concept it just
he definitely needs a little polish but

00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:26.970
he definitely needs a little polish but
 

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.480
he definitely needs a little polish but
but the controls kill it yeah it needs

00:48:29.480 --> 00:48:29.490
but the controls kill it yeah it needs
 

00:48:29.490 --> 00:48:32.030
but the controls kill it yeah it needs
indeed the joystick the what you know if

00:48:32.030 --> 00:48:32.040
indeed the joystick the what you know if
 

00:48:32.040 --> 00:48:33.680
indeed the joystick the what you know if
you actually had a plug-in joystick it

00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:33.690
you actually had a plug-in joystick it
 

00:48:33.690 --> 00:48:34.940
you actually had a plug-in joystick it
would be awesome to have this interface

00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:34.950
would be awesome to have this interface
 

00:48:34.950 --> 00:48:36.380
would be awesome to have this interface
and actually and i think that with it

00:48:36.380 --> 00:48:36.390
and actually and i think that with it
 

00:48:36.390 --> 00:48:38.210
and actually and i think that with it
with an external joystick it'd be cool i

00:48:38.210 --> 00:48:38.220
with an external joystick it'd be cool i
 

00:48:38.220 --> 00:48:39.980
with an external joystick it'd be cool i
would keep this if the user how to

00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:39.990
would keep this if the user how to
 

00:48:39.990 --> 00:48:41.720
would keep this if the user how to
Joystiq plugged into it use the hid

00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:41.730
Joystiq plugged into it use the hid
 

00:48:41.730 --> 00:48:44.210
Joystiq plugged into it use the hid
interface read those axes that and that

00:48:44.210 --> 00:48:44.220
interface read those axes that and that
 

00:48:44.220 --> 00:48:45.620
interface read those axes that and that
would be great but if you actually don't

00:48:45.620 --> 00:48:45.630
would be great but if you actually don't
 

00:48:45.630 --> 00:48:47.480
would be great but if you actually don't
have a joystick plugin then yeah it's

00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:47.490
have a joystick plugin then yeah it's
 

00:48:47.490 --> 00:48:48.800
have a joystick plugin then yeah it's
got to be touch for this kind of game we

00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:48.810
got to be touch for this kind of game we
 

00:48:48.810 --> 00:48:50.660
got to be touch for this kind of game we
just make the game so much more fun and

00:48:50.660 --> 00:48:50.670
just make the game so much more fun and
 

00:48:50.670 --> 00:48:52.430
just make the game so much more fun and
top it would make it a lot easier and I

00:48:52.430 --> 00:48:52.440
top it would make it a lot easier and I
 

00:48:52.440 --> 00:48:53.450
top it would make it a lot easier and I
think maybe that's part of the problem

00:48:53.450 --> 00:48:53.460
think maybe that's part of the problem
 

00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.710
think maybe that's part of the problem
is that this is one of those games were

00:48:54.710 --> 00:48:54.720
is that this is one of those games were
 

00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:56.270
is that this is one of those games were
the challenges in the controls and we're

00:48:56.270 --> 00:48:56.280
the challenges in the controls and we're
 

00:48:56.280 --> 00:48:57.740
the challenges in the controls and we're
in freestyle mode you're not seeing the

00:48:57.740 --> 00:48:57.750
in freestyle mode you're not seeing the
 

00:48:57.750 --> 00:49:01.280
in freestyle mode you're not seeing the
game but also I it was a little tricky

00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:01.290
game but also I it was a little tricky
 

00:49:01.290 --> 00:49:02.300
game but also I it was a little tricky
to figure out which one of those was

00:49:02.300 --> 00:49:02.310
to figure out which one of those was
 

00:49:02.310 --> 00:49:03.950
to figure out which one of those was
actually back to the menu with the with

00:49:03.950 --> 00:49:03.960
actually back to the menu with the with
 

00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.960
actually back to the menu with the with
those little icons so that was a little

00:49:05.960 --> 00:49:05.970
those little icons so that was a little
 

00:49:05.970 --> 00:49:08.840
those little icons so that was a little
trick to you alright we're loading let's

00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:08.850
trick to you alright we're loading let's
 

00:49:08.850 --> 00:49:10.280
trick to you alright we're loading let's
go back to the just just to show you the

00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:10.290
go back to the just just to show you the
 

00:49:10.290 --> 00:49:11.840
go back to the just just to show you the
game itself is a really quickly since

00:49:11.840 --> 00:49:11.850
game itself is a really quickly since
 

00:49:11.850 --> 00:49:13.250
game itself is a really quickly since
we're in our in our last ten minutes and

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:13.260
we're in our in our last ten minutes and
 

00:49:13.260 --> 00:49:15.020
we're in our in our last ten minutes and
I don't want to spend some time here so

00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:15.030
I don't want to spend some time here so
 

00:49:15.030 --> 00:49:16.400
I don't want to spend some time here so
the actual game is you're trying to

00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:16.410
the actual game is you're trying to
 

00:49:16.410 --> 00:49:20.660
the actual game is you're trying to
trying to trace these drawings &amp; and

00:49:20.660 --> 00:49:20.670
trying to trace these drawings &amp; and
 

00:49:20.670 --> 00:49:23.780
trying to trace these drawings &amp; and
then so you can see you can see your

00:49:23.780 --> 00:49:23.790
then so you can see you can see your
 

00:49:23.790 --> 00:49:25.160
then so you can see you can see your
goal you have to get you have to use

00:49:25.160 --> 00:49:25.170
goal you have to get you have to use
 

00:49:25.170 --> 00:49:27.290
goal you have to get you have to use
multiple colors and then what in what

00:49:27.290 --> 00:49:27.300
multiple colors and then what in what
 

00:49:27.300 --> 00:49:30.950
multiple colors and then what in what
you end up getting is something that

00:49:30.950 --> 00:49:30.960
you end up getting is something that
 

00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.150
you end up getting is something that
looks like this so there's there's what

00:49:32.150 --> 00:49:32.160
looks like this so there's there's what
 

00:49:32.160 --> 00:49:34.250
looks like this so there's there's what
I have to actually trace and so you can

00:49:34.250 --> 00:49:34.260
I have to actually trace and so you can
 

00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:35.420
I have to actually trace and so you can
see if you could just draw with your

00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:35.430
see if you could just draw with your
 

00:49:35.430 --> 00:49:36.710
see if you could just draw with your
finger the game would actually be fairly

00:49:36.710 --> 00:49:36.720
finger the game would actually be fairly
 

00:49:36.720 --> 00:49:38.750
finger the game would actually be fairly
easy yeah so so that's I think the

00:49:38.750 --> 00:49:38.760
easy yeah so so that's I think the
 

00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:40.130
easy yeah so so that's I think the
problem with saying oh we should just

00:49:40.130 --> 00:49:40.140
problem with saying oh we should just
 

00:49:40.140 --> 00:49:42.200
problem with saying oh we should just
allow them to dry so so that's its but

00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:42.210
allow them to dry so so that's its but
 

00:49:42.210 --> 00:49:43.880
allow them to dry so so that's its but
again I mean this is what what Chris

00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:43.890
again I mean this is what what Chris
 

00:49:43.890 --> 00:49:46.280
again I mean this is what what Chris
Pruitt used to say right is it you

00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:46.290
Pruitt used to say right is it you
 

00:49:46.290 --> 00:49:47.990
Pruitt used to say right is it you
should be you should be fighting the

00:49:47.990 --> 00:49:48.000
should be you should be fighting the
 

00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:50.810
should be you should be fighting the
game not the controls if the game is all

00:49:50.810 --> 00:49:50.820
game not the controls if the game is all
 

00:49:50.820 --> 00:49:53.390
game not the controls if the game is all
about how crummy the controls are then

00:49:53.390 --> 00:49:53.400
about how crummy the controls are then
 

00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:54.980
about how crummy the controls are then
you know maybe your game design need

00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:54.990
you know maybe your game design need
 

00:49:54.990 --> 00:49:56.570
you know maybe your game design need
some thought absolutely yeah so that's

00:49:56.570 --> 00:49:56.580
some thought absolutely yeah so that's
 

00:49:56.580 --> 00:49:58.310
some thought absolutely yeah so that's
how you know my only my only thought on

00:49:58.310 --> 00:49:58.320
how you know my only my only thought on
 

00:49:58.320 --> 00:50:00.260
how you know my only my only thought on
that is I did you know it's it sometimes

00:50:00.260 --> 00:50:00.270
that is I did you know it's it sometimes
 

00:50:00.270 --> 00:50:02.660
that is I did you know it's it sometimes
you know designing the challenge around

00:50:02.660 --> 00:50:02.670
you know designing the challenge around
 

00:50:02.670 --> 00:50:04.490
you know designing the challenge around
the controls is not the best experience

00:50:04.490 --> 00:50:04.500
the controls is not the best experience
 

00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:06.890
the controls is not the best experience
especially lightning okay so here we are

00:50:06.890 --> 00:50:06.900
especially lightning okay so here we are
 

00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:09.380
especially lightning okay so here we are
so fight this last one is the last one

00:50:09.380 --> 00:50:09.390
so fight this last one is the last one
 

00:50:09.390 --> 00:50:14.470
so fight this last one is the last one
ahead love those guys yeah I you know

00:50:14.470 --> 00:50:14.480
ahead love those guys yeah I you know
 

00:50:14.480 --> 00:50:15.880
ahead love those guys yeah I you know
this I just want to put the screen on

00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:15.890
this I just want to put the screen on
 

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.190
this I just want to put the screen on
this game this is this is a beautifully

00:50:18.190 --> 00:50:18.200
this game this is this is a beautifully
 

00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:21.070
this game this is this is a beautifully
beautifully done by one bad guy first of

00:50:21.070 --> 00:50:21.080
beautifully done by one bad guy first of
 

00:50:21.080 --> 00:50:22.810
beautifully done by one bad guy first of
all this is exactly how to give

00:50:22.810 --> 00:50:22.820
all this is exactly how to give
 

00:50:22.820 --> 00:50:26.020
all this is exactly how to give
character to a screen without actually

00:50:26.020 --> 00:50:26.030
character to a screen without actually
 

00:50:26.030 --> 00:50:28.630
character to a screen without actually
doing any work so he follows your finger

00:50:28.630 --> 00:50:28.640
doing any work so he follows your finger
 

00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.880
doing any work so he follows your finger
as you trace through the menu so they're

00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:30.890
as you trace through the menu so they're
 

00:50:30.890 --> 00:50:33.490
as you trace through the menu so they're
so awesome you know you no no no frames

00:50:33.490 --> 00:50:33.500
so awesome you know you no no no frames
 

00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:35.830
so awesome you know you no no no frames
of animation required here to do this

00:50:35.830 --> 00:50:35.840
of animation required here to do this
 

00:50:35.840 --> 00:50:37.210
of animation required here to do this
and it's just kind of a cool little

00:50:37.210 --> 00:50:37.220
and it's just kind of a cool little
 

00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:40.570
and it's just kind of a cool little
start to to what is really a quirky and

00:50:40.570 --> 00:50:40.580
start to to what is really a quirky and
 

00:50:40.580 --> 00:50:42.130
start to to what is really a quirky and
beautiful game design but notice also

00:50:42.130 --> 00:50:42.140
beautiful game design but notice also
 

00:50:42.140 --> 00:50:44.109
beautiful game design but notice also
that they didn't just trivial tribute

00:50:44.109 --> 00:50:44.119
that they didn't just trivial tribute
 

00:50:44.119 --> 00:50:46.180
that they didn't just trivial tribute
follow it it's got some physics to it

00:50:46.180 --> 00:50:46.190
follow it it's got some physics to it
 

00:50:46.190 --> 00:50:48.940
follow it it's got some physics to it
you know there's a lot of care taken to

00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:48.950
you know there's a lot of care taken to
 

00:50:48.950 --> 00:50:50.770
you know there's a lot of care taken to
make it yeah now the game is really

00:50:50.770 --> 00:50:50.780
make it yeah now the game is really
 

00:50:50.780 --> 00:50:52.359
make it yeah now the game is really
simple you actually play the game just

00:50:52.359 --> 00:50:52.369
simple you actually play the game just
 

00:50:52.369 --> 00:50:54.220
simple you actually play the game just
by using a touch in order to in order to

00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:54.230
by using a touch in order to in order to
 

00:50:54.230 --> 00:50:56.349
by using a touch in order to in order to
raise and lower your guys yeah and this

00:50:56.349 --> 00:50:56.359
raise and lower your guys yeah and this
 

00:50:56.359 --> 00:50:58.810
raise and lower your guys yeah and this
this is just a single touch yet but you

00:50:58.810 --> 00:50:58.820
this is just a single touch yet but you
 

00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:01.120
this is just a single touch yet but you
know the thing is this the sort of

00:51:01.120 --> 00:51:01.130
know the thing is this the sort of
 

00:51:01.130 --> 00:51:02.500
know the thing is this the sort of
single touch control has been done over

00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:02.510
single touch control has been done over
 

00:51:02.510 --> 00:51:04.870
single touch control has been done over
and over and over again but never quite

00:51:04.870 --> 00:51:04.880
and over and over again but never quite
 

00:51:04.880 --> 00:51:06.730
and over and over again but never quite
like this yeah so what you have to do is

00:51:06.730 --> 00:51:06.740
like this yeah so what you have to do is
 

00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:08.140
like this yeah so what you have to do is
you know then you have to tap things in

00:51:08.140 --> 00:51:08.150
you know then you have to tap things in
 

00:51:08.150 --> 00:51:09.640
you know then you have to tap things in
addition to the in addition to flying

00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:09.650
addition to the in addition to flying
 

00:51:09.650 --> 00:51:11.260
addition to the in addition to flying
the plane which is where it gets kind of

00:51:11.260 --> 00:51:11.270
the plane which is where it gets kind of
 

00:51:11.270 --> 00:51:12.670
the plane which is where it gets kind of
fun and complicated and the game is

00:51:12.670 --> 00:51:12.680
fun and complicated and the game is
 

00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:15.130
fun and complicated and the game is
actually really really deep very varied

00:51:15.130 --> 00:51:15.140
actually really really deep very varied
 

00:51:15.140 --> 00:51:16.599
actually really really deep very varied
there's quite a lot to do in the game

00:51:16.599 --> 00:51:16.609
there's quite a lot to do in the game
 

00:51:16.609 --> 00:51:18.670
