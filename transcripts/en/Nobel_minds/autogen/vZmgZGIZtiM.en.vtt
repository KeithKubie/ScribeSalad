00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:11.450
 

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:14.960
so today I'll start by trying to

00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:14.970
so today I'll start by trying to
 

00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.250
so today I'll start by trying to
describe this notion of the possibility

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:19.260
describe this notion of the possibility
 

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:23.150
describe this notion of the possibility
of progress and explain why when I was

00:04:23.150 --> 00:04:23.160
of progress and explain why when I was
 

00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:25.580
of progress and explain why when I was
in graduate school in 1980 there were so

00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:25.590
in graduate school in 1980 there were so
 

00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:28.250
in graduate school in 1980 there were so
many doubts about whether progress was

00:04:28.250 --> 00:04:28.260
many doubts about whether progress was
 

00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:31.820
many doubts about whether progress was
possible whether this positive force of

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:31.830
possible whether this positive force of
 

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:35.120
possible whether this positive force of
discovery could offset the tension the

00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:35.130
discovery could offset the tension the
 

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:37.430
discovery could offset the tension the
restraining force of the the scarce

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.440
restraining force of the the scarce
 

00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:41.300
restraining force of the the scarce
resources then I'll describe the theory

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:41.310
resources then I'll describe the theory
 

00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.220
resources then I'll describe the theory
I developed the trans show that progress

00:04:43.220 --> 00:04:43.230
I developed the trans show that progress
 

00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:47.440
I developed the trans show that progress
is indeed possible at least in principle

00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:47.450
is indeed possible at least in principle
 

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:50.660
is indeed possible at least in principle
I'll turn after that to the description

00:04:50.660 --> 00:04:50.670
I'll turn after that to the description
 

00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:53.240
I'll turn after that to the description

graduate school in 1980 I think there

graduate school in 1980 I think there
 

00:05:19.169 --> 00:05:21.980
graduate school in 1980 I think there
were at least three distinct forces that

00:05:21.980 --> 00:05:21.990
were at least three distinct forces that
 

00:05:21.990 --> 00:05:24.440
were at least three distinct forces that
were undermining confidence about the
