00:00:00.044 --> 00:00:03.740
So here's a little, tiny POMDP that I've
thought about in the past that I think

00:00:03.740 --> 00:00:05.461
makes makes for good illustration.

00:00:05.461 --> 00:00:09.265
So we've got four underlying states,
these four here,

00:00:09.265 --> 00:00:12.444
the four circles, and
we've got two actions.

00:00:12.444 --> 00:00:15.492
The actions essentially
move the agent left and

00:00:15.492 --> 00:00:19.923
right along this kind of hallway
type thing, with some exceptions.

00:00:19.923 --> 00:00:21.593
So from the green state,

00:00:21.593 --> 00:00:25.734
any action just resets you randomly
to one of the blue states.

00:00:25.734 --> 00:00:29.060
And otherwise,
things move left and right.

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:33.350
At the end of the hallways here, these
two end states, if you try to go right

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.400
when there's no more space to go,
you just stick where you were.

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.090
And if you try to go left when
there's no more space to go,

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:39.800
you stick where you were.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:43.440
And just to ground it
the rest of the way out,

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:48.120
actions that take you to the green
state give you a reward of one.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:49.540
So does that makes some sense to you?

00:00:49.540 --> 00:00:51.810
Do you do follow how this would go?

00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:56.370
&gt;&gt; I do, and I just realize,
if I don't know which blue state I'm in,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:58.900
this is a scary,
scary little problem to try to solve.

00:00:58.900 --> 00:01:01.470
&gt;&gt; Good, so that was the thing I
guess I neglected to point out.

00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:04.280
I'm showing the observations in
this diagram with the colors.

00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.720
So let me just number the states
just for ease of referring to them.

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:12.911
We've got three states, 1, 2, 3, and 4.

00:01:12.911 --> 00:01:16.740
State 1 is blue, state 2 is blue,
state 4 is blue.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:19.470
Based on the immediate
observation alone,

00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:21.230
we don't know really where we are.

00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:24.050
And we could be a place that's
to the right of the goal, so

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:25.930
we should go left to get reward.

00:01:25.930 --> 00:01:28.150
Or we could be a place that's
to the left of the goal,

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:30.650
which means we're going to
go right to get reward.

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:32.710
And so we're kind of in a tricky spot.

00:01:32.710 --> 00:01:35.570
&gt;&gt; Yeah, this is unfortunate.

00:01:35.570 --> 00:01:37.830
You're trapped like a rat in a maze.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:38.965
&gt;&gt; I see, I see.

00:01:38.965 --> 00:01:43.640
Yeah, you're pointing out that, [LAUGH]
to you, this looks like a rat drawing,

00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.170
but it really is not
supposed to be a rat.

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:46.140
This is not the nose.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:47.570
This is not the tail.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.400
It really is just transitions.

00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:50.745
&gt;&gt; I think you doth protest too much.

00:01:50.745 --> 00:01:52.304
