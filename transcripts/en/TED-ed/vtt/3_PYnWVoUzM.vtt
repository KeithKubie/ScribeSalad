00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.980
Approximately 7 million people around the 
world die from heart attacks every year,

00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:14.901
and cardiovascular disease,

00:00:14.901 --> 00:00:18.060
which causes heart attacks and other
problems like strokes,

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:20.500
is the world's leading killer.

00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.650
So what causes a heart attack?

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.140
Like all muscles, the heart needs oxygen,

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:28.550
and during a heart attack,
it can't get enough.

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:30.541
Fatty deposits, or plaques,

00:00:30.541 --> 00:00:33.241
develop on the walls 
of our coronary arteries.

00:00:33.241 --> 00:00:37.208
Those are the vessels that supply
oxygenated blood to the heart.

00:00:37.208 --> 00:00:39.490
These plaques grow as we age,

00:00:39.490 --> 00:00:40.760
sometimes getting chunky,

00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:41.780
hardened,

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:43.091
or enflamed.

00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:45.960
Eventually, the plaques can turn
into blockages.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.791
If one of the plaques ruptures or cracks,

00:00:48.791 --> 00:00:52.169
a blood clot will form around it
in minutes,

00:00:52.169 --> 00:00:56.252
and a partially closed artery
can become completely blocked.

00:00:56.252 --> 00:00:58.712
Blood flow is cut off 
to the cardiac muscle

00:00:58.712 --> 00:01:03.061
and the oxygen-starved cells start to die
within several minutes.

00:01:03.061 --> 00:01:05.911
This is a myocardial infarction,

00:01:05.911 --> 00:01:07.311
or heart attack.

00:01:07.311 --> 00:01:11.302
Things can rapidly deteriorate
in the absence of treatment.

00:01:11.302 --> 00:01:14.712
The injured muscle may not be able
to pump blood as well,

00:01:14.712 --> 00:01:17.102
and its rhythm might be thrown off.

00:01:17.102 --> 00:01:21.472
In the worst case scenario,
a heart attack can cause sudden death.

00:01:21.472 --> 00:01:24.441
And how do you know that someone
is having a heart attack?

00:01:24.441 --> 00:01:26.723
The most common symptom is chest pain

00:01:26.723 --> 00:01:29.622
caused by the oxygen-deprived 
heart muscle.

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:32.822
Patients describe it as crushing
or vice-like.

00:01:32.822 --> 00:01:34.633
It can radiate to the left arm,

00:01:34.633 --> 00:01:35.472
jaw,

00:01:35.472 --> 00:01:36.241
back,

00:01:36.241 --> 00:01:37.473
or abdomen.

00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:41.622
But it's not always as sudden and dramatic
as it is in the movies.

00:01:41.622 --> 00:01:43.513
Some people experience nausea

00:01:43.513 --> 00:01:44.932
or shortness of breath.

00:01:44.932 --> 00:01:48.283
Symptoms may be less prominent
in women and the elderly.

00:01:48.283 --> 00:01:52.592
For them, weakness and tiredness
may be the main signal.

00:01:52.592 --> 00:01:54.513
And surprisingly, in many people,

00:01:54.513 --> 00:01:58.642
especially those with diabetes,
which affects the nerves that carry pain,

00:01:58.642 --> 00:02:01.192
a heart attack may be silent.

00:02:01.192 --> 00:02:03.993
If you think that someone might be 
having a heart attack,

00:02:03.993 --> 00:02:07.163
the most important thing 
is to respond quickly.

00:02:07.163 --> 00:02:11.032
If you have access to emergency medical
services, call them.

00:02:11.032 --> 00:02:13.474
They're the fastest way 
to get to a hospital.

00:02:13.474 --> 00:02:15.825
Taking aspirin, which thins the blood,

00:02:15.825 --> 00:02:18.624
and nitroglycerin, 
which opens up the artery,

00:02:18.624 --> 00:02:21.594
can help keep the heart attack
from getting worse.

00:02:21.594 --> 00:02:24.933
In the emergency room, 
doctors can diagnose a heart attack.

00:02:24.933 --> 00:02:27.524
They commonly use an electrocardiogram

00:02:27.524 --> 00:02:30.034
to measure the heart's 
electrical activity

00:02:30.034 --> 00:02:33.294
and a blood test to assess 
heart muscle damage.

00:02:33.294 --> 00:02:36.765
The patient is then taken to a high-tech
cardiac suite

00:02:36.765 --> 00:02:40.105
where tests are done 
to locate the blockages.

00:02:40.105 --> 00:02:42.734
Cardiologists can reopen 
the blocked artery

00:02:42.734 --> 00:02:47.365
by inflating it with a balloon
in a procedure called an angioplasty.

00:02:47.365 --> 00:02:50.794
Frequently, they also insert a metal
or polymer stent

00:02:50.794 --> 00:02:53.148
that will hold the artery open.

00:02:53.148 --> 00:02:57.625
More extensive blockages might require
coronary artery bypass surgery.

00:02:57.625 --> 00:03:01.730
Using a piece of vein or artery
from another part of the body,

00:03:01.730 --> 00:03:05.866
heart surgeons can reroute blood flow
around the blockage.

00:03:05.866 --> 00:03:09.389
These procedures reestablish circulation
to the cardiac muscle,

00:03:09.389 --> 00:03:11.367
restoring heart function.

00:03:11.367 --> 00:03:13.111
Heart attack treatment is advancing,

00:03:13.111 --> 00:03:15.448
but prevention is vital.

00:03:15.448 --> 00:03:19.070
Genetics and lifestyle factors
both affect your risk.

00:03:19.070 --> 00:03:22.174
And the good news is that you can
change your lifestyle.

00:03:22.174 --> 00:03:24.566
Exercise, a healthy diet,
and weight loss

00:03:24.566 --> 00:03:27.039
all lower the risk of heart attacks,

00:03:27.039 --> 00:03:29.019
whether you've had one before or not.

00:03:29.019 --> 00:03:32.006
Doctors recommend exercising
a few times a week,

00:03:32.006 --> 00:03:35.180
doing both aerobic activity
and strength training.

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.826
A heart-healthy diet is low
in sugar and saturated fats,

00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.096
which are both linked to heart disease.

00:03:41.096 --> 00:03:42.567
So what should you eat?

00:03:42.567 --> 00:03:44.237
Lots of fiber from vegetables,

00:03:44.237 --> 00:03:46.683
chicken and fish instead of red meat,

00:03:46.683 --> 00:03:49.946
whole grains and nuts like walnuts
and almonds

00:03:49.946 --> 00:03:52.356
all seem to be beneficial.

00:03:52.356 --> 00:03:56.737
A good diet and exercise plan can also
keep your weight in a healthy range,

00:03:56.737 --> 00:03:59.548
which will lower 
your heart attack risk as well.

00:03:59.548 --> 00:04:03.167
And of course, medications can also
help prevent heart attacks.

00:04:03.167 --> 00:04:06.267
Doctors often prescribe low-dose
aspirin, for example,

00:04:06.267 --> 00:04:09.976
particularly for patients who've
already had a heart attack

00:04:09.976 --> 00:04:12.847
and for those known to be
at high risk.

00:04:12.847 --> 00:04:14.956
And drugs that help manage risk factors,

00:04:14.956 --> 00:04:18.337
like high blood pressure, cholesterol,
and diabetes,

00:04:18.337 --> 00:04:21.038
will make heart attacks less likely, too.

00:04:21.038 --> 00:04:25.057
Heart attacks may be common, 
but they don't have to be inevitable.

00:04:25.057 --> 00:04:26.176
A healthy diet,

00:04:26.176 --> 00:04:27.599
avoiding tobacco use,

00:04:27.599 --> 00:04:28.728
staying fit,

00:04:28.728 --> 00:04:31.528
and enjoying plenty of sleep
and lots of laughter

00:04:31.528 --> 00:04:35.769
all go a long way in making sure
your body's most important muscle

00:04:35.769 --> 00:04:37.417
keeps on beating.
