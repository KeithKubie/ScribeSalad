00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my code.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
I compute the dx and dy the way I told you by using the spath of index i + 1

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
minus the same at index.

00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000
My rx and ry, called drx and dry over here, are the robot estimates

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as obtained by the filter minus the path.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Then I apply the exact same two equations that I gave you for the progress U

00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
and the crosstrack error cte as shown over here.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Of course, if I advance too much I add 1 to the index.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:33.000
You could have done this before computing the crosstrack error,

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.000
but I chose to do it afterwards.

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
So I add the missing bracket, and when I run it I get sometimes a collision.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000
There are two collisions here but I still reach the goal in 140 steps.

00:00:45.000 --> 09:59:59.000
Let me run it again, and now I reach the goal without collision.
