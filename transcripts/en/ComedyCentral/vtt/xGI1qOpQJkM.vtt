00:00:00.867 --> 00:00:03.770
(upbeat guitar strumming)

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:06.006
- [Narrator] Dead Kevin.

00:00:06.006 --> 00:00:09.609
- [Ryan] So she picked me up
and we walked out of the bar.

00:00:09.609 --> 00:00:10.877
She was that strong.

00:00:10.877 --> 00:00:11.811
- Like in that movie?
- She was huge, yeah.

00:00:11.811 --> 00:00:13.146 align:start size:69% position:31%
- Oh, hey!
- Hey!

00:00:13.146 --> 00:00:14.080 align:start size:94% position:6%
- Look at this little guy.
- It's a dog.

00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:15.682
- Yeah, I'd be careful guys.

00:00:15.682 --> 00:00:16.616
He might have fleas.

00:00:16.616 --> 00:00:18.118
- Oh, come on, he's cute.

00:00:18.118 --> 00:00:19.452 align:start size:75% position:25%
Look at him.
- He's homeless.

00:00:19.452 --> 00:00:20.620
- Looks like a street dog to me.

00:00:20.620 --> 00:00:21.454 align:start size:88% position:13%
(dog whimpers)
- Well, yeah, that's why

00:00:21.454 --> 00:00:22.455
he needs a home.

00:00:22.455 --> 00:00:23.590
Come on, buddy.

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:24.524
- Want a home, little guy?

00:00:24.524 --> 00:00:25.358
- [Ahmed] Come home with us?

00:00:25.358 --> 00:00:26.459
Wanna come home with us?

00:00:26.459 --> 00:00:27.861 align:start size:84% position:16%
- Come on.
- Come on, come on.

00:00:27.861 --> 00:00:29.462
(laughing)

00:00:29.462 --> 00:00:32.032 align:start size:97% position:3%
- Aw, look at him.
- Hey, hey, hey, hey buddy!

00:00:32.032 --> 00:00:33.633 align:start size:75% position:25%
- (laughing) Hi.
- Hey, hey.

00:00:33.633 --> 00:00:35.435
- We can call you Pumpkin.

00:00:35.435 --> 00:00:36.936
- Pumpkin?
- Pumpkin?

00:00:36.936 --> 00:00:38.304 align:start size:94% position:6%
- He's definitely a Dave.
- He's not a Pumpkin!

00:00:38.304 --> 00:00:39.973
- Yeah, he's a Pumpkin.
- He looks like a Dave.

00:00:39.973 --> 00:00:41.341
- Dave?
- Yeah.

00:00:41.341 --> 00:00:42.308
- No.

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:43.576
- Let's call him Gladiator.

00:00:43.576 --> 00:00:45.578
- No, he's too sweet
to be a Gladiator.

00:00:45.578 --> 00:00:47.313
- Gladiator.

00:00:47.313 --> 00:00:49.349
- Let's give him
some space, guys.

00:00:49.349 --> 00:00:51.384
- How about Max?

00:00:51.384 --> 00:00:52.385
- Max!

00:00:52.385 --> 00:00:53.286
- [Ryan and Ahmed] Max!

00:00:53.286 --> 00:00:54.354
- Max!

00:00:54.354 --> 00:00:55.622
Max.

00:00:55.622 --> 00:00:56.489
Come here.

00:00:56.489 --> 00:00:58.091
Lay with me.

00:00:58.091 --> 00:00:59.292
Hey, buddy.

00:00:59.292 --> 00:01:01.027
Hey, hey, come on.

00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:02.629
Max, Max!

00:01:02.629 --> 00:01:04.164
- Max! Look at me!

00:01:04.164 --> 00:01:05.031
Look into my eyes.

00:01:05.031 --> 00:01:06.699
Look at my eyes.

00:01:06.699 --> 00:01:07.934
Okay?

00:01:07.934 --> 00:01:08.768
Sit.

00:01:10.136 --> 00:01:10.970
You sit!

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:14.207
(plastic bag rustling)

00:01:15.208 --> 00:01:17.977
(dog whimpering)

00:01:21.247 --> 00:01:22.482
- She said it was a break,

00:01:22.482 --> 00:01:24.117
but it feels more
like a break up.

00:01:24.117 --> 00:01:25.652
She never responds to my texts.

00:01:25.652 --> 00:01:27.253
- Ready?

00:01:27.253 --> 00:01:28.221
Go get them!

00:01:28.221 --> 00:01:28.955
Go get them!
(dog barking)

00:01:28.955 --> 00:01:30.290
(screaming)

00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:31.791
Oh shit!

00:01:31.791 --> 00:01:35.428
- I don't have anything to
give you or anything, so...

00:01:35.428 --> 00:01:36.396
- Yeah, I love this!

00:01:36.396 --> 00:01:37.097
I love you!
(dog barking)

00:01:37.097 --> 00:01:38.331
Oh no!

00:01:38.331 --> 00:01:39.999
- And it's like,
what is she doing?

00:01:39.999 --> 00:01:42.402
I don't know what she's
doing, but we used to--

00:01:42.402 --> 00:01:43.470
(dog barking)
- Good boy!

00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:44.437
Ow! Fuck that!

00:01:44.437 --> 00:01:45.638
It's so bad, it's so good!

00:01:45.638 --> 00:01:47.874
(dog barking)
Good boy! Ow!

00:01:47.874 --> 00:01:48.708
- Here.

00:01:49.576 --> 00:01:50.910
Go eat this.

00:01:50.910 --> 00:01:53.379
(dog panting)

00:01:53.379 --> 00:01:56.716
- We're going to have a nice
long, happy life together, Max.

00:01:56.716 --> 00:01:58.118
- I always wanted a dog.

00:01:58.118 --> 00:02:00.954
(doorbell ringing)

00:02:04.524 --> 00:02:05.458
- Hi, sorry to bother you.

00:02:05.458 --> 00:02:06.659
I'm looking for my dog.

00:02:06.659 --> 00:02:07.494
He's a small--

00:02:07.494 --> 00:02:08.394
(dog barking)

00:02:08.394 --> 00:02:09.829 align:start size:75% position:25%
Oh my god!
(dog whimpering)

00:02:09.829 --> 00:02:11.064
That's my baby.

00:02:11.064 --> 00:02:11.898
Oh yeah.

00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.902
Why do you have my dog?

00:02:17.137 --> 00:02:19.639
- We thought he was homeless.

00:02:19.639 --> 00:02:21.975
- No, he's wearing a collar.

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:28.515
- Oh, we thought it was
a street dog necklace.

00:02:28.515 --> 00:02:29.983
- It's not okay.

00:02:29.983 --> 00:02:31.251
- No.

00:02:31.251 --> 00:02:33.119
No, in retrospect,
we're, that's not.

00:02:33.119 --> 00:02:34.287
We're not okay.

00:02:34.287 --> 00:02:35.121
- [Woman] It's not.

00:02:35.121 --> 00:02:37.056
- We are sorry.

00:02:37.056 --> 00:02:39.159
- Yeah, I mean, we'll keep him.

00:02:39.159 --> 00:02:40.260
If you want us to keep him--

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.995
- We taught him well, I think.

00:02:41.995 --> 00:02:42.829
- Come on, Dave.

00:02:42.829 --> 00:02:44.330
Let's go, come on.

00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:46.933
- [Jack] Oh, I'm sorry, did
you say his name was Dave?

00:02:46.933 --> 00:02:47.901
Did you just hear that?

00:02:47.901 --> 00:02:51.037
- Remember what I taught you.

00:02:51.037 --> 00:02:53.940
(guitar strumming)

00:02:55.608 --> 00:02:57.110
- From the majestic Pyrenees

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.779 align:start size:84% position:16%
to the Nova Scotian
mountain snap warbler,

00:02:59.779 --> 00:03:00.947
dogs have been man's best friend

00:03:00.947 --> 00:03:02.482
since the beginning of time.
