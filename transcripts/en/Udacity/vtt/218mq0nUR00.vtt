00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:03.520
There are a couple of different
ways to let your mobile app know

00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:05.880
which analytics account to use.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:11.120
You can do it programmatically, or
you can use an xml configuration file.

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:12.020
In this lesson,

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:16.170
we're going to use an xml file to
configure our analytics tracker.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:21.310
You'll need to create a new xml
file in the res xml folder.

00:00:21.310 --> 00:00:26.380
Go to res choose New &gt;
Android Resource Directory.

00:00:26.380 --> 00:00:28.200
The name of the directory is xml.

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:32.340
Now that you've got your xml folder,
you create a new resource file.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:34.930
You can call the file what you like.

00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:40.190
I suggest something like track_app.xml

00:00:40.190 --> 00:00:44.270
You'll need to make sure that
the root element is resources.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:47.860
The most important thing to put
in the analytics config file

00:00:47.860 --> 00:00:50.020
is the analytics account id.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:53.778
Do that by adding a string
resource that has the name

00:00:53.778 --> 00:00:59.560
ga_trackingId and
the value is your analytics id.

00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:04.450
And remember that you can get your cam
id from the analytics admin dashboard.

00:01:04.450 --> 00:01:08.600
But to start within our app, we're
going to enable automatic tracking, so

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:14.540
you'll need to add the string
resource ga_autoActivityTracking

00:01:14.540 --> 00:01:16.000
to the config file.

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:18.400
The autoActivityTracking
needs to be set to true.

00:01:19.570 --> 00:01:22.560
This is the minimum you need in
your tracking config file, but

00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:25.570
I strongly recommend you
also configure screen names
