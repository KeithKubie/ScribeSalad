00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:09.700
Scientifically when it comes to acupuncture,
it’s hard to see the point.

00:00:09.700 --> 00:00:12.140
Hello everyone, Julian here for DNews.

00:00:12.140 --> 00:00:15.839
Acupuncture is the practice of pricking skin
or tissue with fine needles; it’s usually

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.280
used for pain relief although it’s claimed
to have a plethora of other benefits.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.920
The first definitive description of acupuncture
is from China over 2000 years ago. and at

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:29.380
the time it was believed that illness was
caused when life force, known as qi, couldn’t

00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:30.910
properly flow through the body.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:34.390
Or when the two forms of qi, yin and yang,
were out of balance.

00:00:34.390 --> 00:00:38.540
Prodding certain points would clear the blockages
and restore the flow of qi, causing the illness

00:00:38.540 --> 00:00:39.570
to subside.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.290
If this sounds silly to you, remember that
around the same time in the western world

00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:47.510
we had a similar theory about the imbalance
of “humors,” and doctors used to think

00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:51.431
people were sick because they had just too
much of this blood stuff and it needed to

00:00:51.431 --> 00:00:52.431
come out.

00:00:52.431 --> 00:00:55.631
But while bloodletting went out of style around
the same time as child labor, acupuncture

00:00:55.631 --> 00:00:59.039
has been making a comeback since the 1950s
as a tool for pain relief.

00:00:59.039 --> 00:01:03.260
It’s also used to treat depression, irritable
bowel syndrome, rheumatoid arthritis, smoking

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:07.710
addiction, chronic asthma, stroke rehabilitation,
epilepsy, insomnia, morning sickness, and

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:10.440
glaucoma, high blood pressure, low blood pressure,
even colorblindness!

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:18.670
Protip: if something claims to treat all of
these ailments, that might be a red flag.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:22.619
Whether or not acupuncture works is controversial,
and part of the problem is that it is inherently

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:24.619
difficult to study scientifically.

00:01:24.619 --> 00:01:28.439
Some factors like the soothing nature of the
acupuncture room are easy to control for:

00:01:28.439 --> 00:01:31.020
just turn up the lights and cut out the Careless
Whisper.

00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:34.490
But the act of putting in the needle itself
causes headaches for researchers.

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:38.240
If the researchers know if the treatment is
a placebo, it can affect their results.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:42.300
So, scientists have developed a sort of stealth
needle to overcome this problem.

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:46.509
It’s concealed in a sheath, and either goes
in all the way or only pokes the surface.

00:01:46.509 --> 00:01:50.131
The goal is for the patient to believe the
needle is in, and the researcher won’t know

00:01:50.131 --> 00:01:51.710
one way or the other.

00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:55.990
But even with these sham needles and with
a plethora of research, there is still considerable

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:56.990
debate.

00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:01.229
A 2003 World Health Organization review of
multiple acupuncture studies showed oodles

00:02:01.229 --> 00:02:02.649
of positive results.

00:02:02.649 --> 00:02:07.030
This review, however, omitted trials were
sham acupuncture and the real thing had similar

00:02:07.030 --> 00:02:08.030
effects.

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:11.720
Plus, a majority of the studies were published
in Asian journals, and as Andrew Vickers of

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.670
the Research Council for Complementary Medicine
pointed out in a different review of acupuncture

00:02:16.670 --> 00:02:22.590
studies, “all trials originating in China,
Japan, Hong Kong, and Taiwan were positive.”

00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:27.280
By comparison 53% of reviewed trials in the
US favored the treatment.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:28.850
More recent reviews have debunked acupuncture.

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:33.220
A 2006 meta analysis published by the Journal
of Internal Medicine found that the results

00:02:33.220 --> 00:02:36.379
of acupuncture treatment couldn’t be differentiated
from the placebo.

00:02:36.379 --> 00:02:42.000
A 2010 meta analysis of meta analyses (that’s
so meta) in the Journal of the International

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.459
Association for the Study of Pain concluded
there was little evidence supporting acupuncture

00:02:46.459 --> 00:02:48.340
as an effective form of pain relief.

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:52.920
But in 2012, a meta analysis out of the Memorial
Sloan Kettering Cancer Center - authored by

00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.250
that same Vickers guy from earlier - came
out in favor of acupuncture, finding it had

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:01.590
an effect greater than the placebo, but conceded
it was “relatively modest.”

00:03:01.590 --> 00:03:04.849
Now this is the point where I’d normally
conclude more research is needed, but this

00:03:04.849 --> 00:03:06.730
time I’m not so sure.

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:11.040
There have been over 3,000 trials on acupuncture
there’s still no conclusive evidence that

00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.480
being poked with needles alone reduces pain
or other ailments in a significant way.

00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:17.920
I’ll... let you draw your own conclusions.

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:22.140
Even if Acupuncture doesn’t have a positive
effect, at worst it’s usually harmless.

00:03:22.140 --> 00:03:24.450
The same can’t be said for homeopathy.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:46.000

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:49.700
Have you ever been acupunctured?

00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:50.700
Did it help with anything?

00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:55.499
Do you think it was the placebo effect?
