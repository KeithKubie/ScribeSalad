00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
So now, we have an equation that can be implemented on the computer.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Let's start by simulating the following situation.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:15.000
A wire is briefly heated by a candle so that some part of the wire is at the temperature of the flame

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
and the rest of the wire is at room temperature is times zero

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
We blow out the candle so that there's no more heating

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000
and then we watch heat conduction in action.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
How does this energy spread to the left and to the right.

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The code comes with some pretty fine constants for your convenience.

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:37.000
It provides to erase one with the old temperatures at the beginning of the step

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000
and one for the new temperatures at the end of the step.

00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
And you have to compute the new temperature from the old temperatures

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000
for the compartment number i

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
A note about the implementation in case you're wondering about this line here,

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000
we're exchanging the roles of these two arrays temperatures new,

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.000
temperatures old after every step.

00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Once the new temperatures have been computed, they become the old temperatures for the next step,

00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:06.000
which means that one of these arrays can be reused for the new, new temperatures if you will.

00:01:06.000 --> 09:59:59.000
This saves us from using tons of arrays. We're just using these two arrays with different roles.
