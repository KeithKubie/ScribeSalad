00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Well, this one is not so bad. The answer is 40° and let's look at why.

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Well, here comes the sun's rays, arriving in parallel all over the surface of the earth.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.000
These lines are supposed to be parallel. Well, let's replace our little guy with just a vertical object.

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Well, check it out-as our rays drawing in some parallel lines has really helped us solve this problem

00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:24.000
because look at what we have here--our angle α which by definition--that's the longitude--

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.000
that's how we define longitude and that's exactly equal to this angle here,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:35.000
which we also happen to call α there, but hey, good coincidence they're the exact same angle.

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:39.000
And so if we measure this angle to be 40°, this must also be 40°.

00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000
We'll see things change a little bit.

00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:44.000
If it's not on the equinox, it gets a bit more tricky but I think you can handle that

00:00:44.000 --> 99:59:59.000
and you'll do that in the premise that at the end of this unit.
