00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:03.336
What is that?

00:00:03.336 --> 00:00:04.587
Oh.

00:00:04.587 --> 00:00:06.172
Those are Japanese
box markers.

00:00:06.172 --> 00:00:08.007
Yep.

00:00:08.007 --> 00:00:09.551
NARRATOR: While
exploring the waterfalls

00:00:09.551 --> 00:00:13.179
beneath the carved gorilla
face, John and his team

00:00:13.179 --> 00:00:15.098
discover a set of markers.

00:00:15.098 --> 00:00:17.892
Those are box markers,
meaning that there's five boxes,

00:00:17.892 --> 00:00:19.269
it looks like, of possible--

00:00:19.269 --> 00:00:20.186
Sure does.

00:00:20.186 --> 00:00:21.020
--treasure.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:22.272
Five boxes of gold.

00:00:22.272 --> 00:00:23.940
Right here.

00:00:23.940 --> 00:00:26.025
These are some of the most
compelling treasure markers

00:00:26.025 --> 00:00:27.152
I've ever seen.

00:00:27.152 --> 00:00:30.822
It looks like a face.

00:00:30.822 --> 00:00:34.743
Well, it almost looks like
two sets of eyeballs and--

00:00:34.743 --> 00:00:35.577
And it's a--

00:00:35.577 --> 00:00:36.453
--nose coming out.

00:00:36.453 --> 00:00:37.120
Right.

00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:38.621
Yeah.

00:00:38.621 --> 00:00:40.665
NARRATOR: Weeks
ago, John and Manny

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:42.500
found what they
believe to be the face

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:45.503
of a gorilla carved in
the uppermost waterfall

00:00:45.503 --> 00:00:46.963
on the mountain.

00:00:46.963 --> 00:00:48.423
Look at that.

00:00:48.423 --> 00:00:50.008
NARRATOR: In the
treasure hunting world,

00:00:50.008 --> 00:00:53.386
it is believed animal face
symbols point to treasure

00:00:53.386 --> 00:00:55.889
based on where their
eyes are looking.

00:00:55.889 --> 00:00:57.932
But John and Manny
weren't certain where

00:00:57.932 --> 00:01:00.810
the gorilla marker pointed.

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:02.395
Finding that gorilla
face was awesome.

00:01:02.395 --> 00:01:03.897
But I couldn't see where
the eye was looking.

00:01:03.897 --> 00:01:06.024
But now, starting to
put it all together,

00:01:06.024 --> 00:01:08.485
it seems like the gorilla face
is pointing to the box markers,

00:01:08.485 --> 00:01:09.903
which is pointing
to this lower punch

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.696
bowl below the box markers.

00:01:11.696 --> 00:01:14.073
And I think if we go down there,
we're going to find a tunnel,

00:01:14.073 --> 00:01:16.493
and it's going to be
filled with treasure.

00:01:16.493 --> 00:01:19.746
Oh, yeah.

00:01:19.746 --> 00:01:24.209
The Japanese loved to
build tunnels behind falls.

00:01:24.209 --> 00:01:27.170
NARRATOR: John thinks it's
possible Yamashita's engineers

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:30.173
diverted the water here,
allowing them to tunnel

00:01:30.173 --> 00:01:32.842
behind the falls,
hiding treasure inside.

00:01:36.387 --> 00:01:39.682
It would be very easy to
hide gold-- it would be--

00:01:39.682 --> 00:01:40.892
hide anything down here.

00:01:43.686 --> 00:01:45.730
Based on the markers
that we saw up top,

00:01:45.730 --> 00:01:47.607
you know, I think this
punch bowl is-- we

00:01:47.607 --> 00:01:48.608
need to explore it some more.

00:01:51.903 --> 00:01:53.029
Very carefully over there.

00:01:53.029 --> 00:01:55.031
Oh, yeah, no problem.

00:01:55.031 --> 00:01:59.661
If there is any metal within
18 feet of this magnetometer,

00:01:59.661 --> 00:02:00.370
it will find it.

00:02:07.752 --> 00:02:09.087
Nothing back here.

00:02:09.087 --> 00:02:10.839
No metal, really,
like light metal here.

00:02:10.839 --> 00:02:11.548
But as I--

00:02:11.548 --> 00:02:12.882
[beeping]

00:02:12.882 --> 00:02:14.968
--bring it back into
the rock face there,

00:02:14.968 --> 00:02:17.011
it really is
screaming down here.

00:02:17.011 --> 00:02:20.431
[suspenseful music playing]

00:02:20.431 --> 00:02:21.391
Oh, yeah.

00:02:21.391 --> 00:02:22.559
Oh, yeah.

00:02:22.559 --> 00:02:25.728
Good signal, good
metallic signal.

00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.064
I think there's one large
accumulation of metal

00:02:28.064 --> 00:02:28.982
right there.

00:02:28.982 --> 00:02:31.067
Yeah.

00:02:31.067 --> 00:02:33.987
Wow, that's pretty incredible.

00:02:33.987 --> 00:02:36.239
NARRATOR: Using a
magnetometer, the team

00:02:36.239 --> 00:02:39.200
believes they have discovered
a large hit to the right

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.619
of the waterfall,
which could indicate

00:02:41.619 --> 00:02:44.038
a significant
concentration of metal

00:02:44.038 --> 00:02:47.041
within 18 feet of the falls.

00:02:47.041 --> 00:02:49.419
Well, if the Japanese were
going to hide treasure here,

00:02:49.419 --> 00:02:51.337
it would be a good
place to do it.

00:02:51.337 --> 00:02:52.714
Now, this is a great spot.

00:02:52.714 --> 00:02:54.465
It's totally hidden
away from everything.

00:02:54.465 --> 00:02:57.218
NARRATOR: To get a better
look, the team decides to try

00:02:57.218 --> 00:02:58.845
draining the plunge pool.

00:02:58.845 --> 00:03:00.847
We're gonna drain
this pond, baby.

00:03:00.847 --> 00:03:02.265
Fire that bad boy up.

00:03:02.265 --> 00:03:03.892
Switch on.

00:03:03.892 --> 00:03:05.184
Yamashita, look out!

00:03:05.184 --> 00:03:07.145
Woo-hoo!

00:03:07.145 --> 00:03:09.439
Yeah, there she goes, yeah.

00:03:09.439 --> 00:03:11.691
NARRATOR: The team's
gas powered pump quickly

00:03:11.691 --> 00:03:13.735
lowers the level
of the plunge pool,

00:03:13.735 --> 00:03:15.904
draining the water downstream.

00:03:15.904 --> 00:03:18.156
Hold on.

00:03:18.156 --> 00:03:20.909
Check this out.

00:03:20.909 --> 00:03:22.744
I got a perfect circle.

00:03:22.744 --> 00:03:24.203
It's a tunnel marker.

00:03:24.203 --> 00:03:25.955
NARRATOR: The team
has just discovered

00:03:25.955 --> 00:03:29.918
a possible golden lily symbol
previously hidden under water,

00:03:29.918 --> 00:03:33.463
which may confirm their belief
that there is a tunnel system

00:03:33.463 --> 00:03:34.881
running under the waterfall.

00:03:34.881 --> 00:03:37.216
Jeremy, would you
get me my magnetometer.

00:03:37.216 --> 00:03:38.426
And that's a strong signal.

00:03:38.426 --> 00:03:40.219
That's down 18 feet.

00:03:40.219 --> 00:03:44.265
And it's directional, so
it's going in that direction.

00:03:44.265 --> 00:03:46.225
One step closer, boys.

00:03:46.225 --> 00:03:47.477
That's right.

00:03:47.477 --> 00:03:49.437
This may be the key right here.

00:03:54.692 --> 00:03:56.277
Going after
Yamashita's gold is

00:03:56.277 --> 00:03:57.862
always going to be dangerous.

00:03:57.862 --> 00:03:59.822
You know, they didn't want
you to get their treasure.

00:03:59.822 --> 00:04:01.366
They didn't send
engineers in here

00:04:01.366 --> 00:04:04.410
to tunnel under a waterfall
to make it easy for us.

00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:06.371
Leave this all.
