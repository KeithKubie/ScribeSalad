00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:02.417
- [Voiceover] Now I want to show you

00:00:02.417 --> 00:00:04.975
a really useful manual skill you could use

00:00:04.975 --> 00:00:08.722
when you have voltages that
look like exponentials.

00:00:08.722 --> 00:00:10.754
And we're gonna talk
about this exponential

00:00:10.754 --> 00:00:13.137
curve here that's generated as part of the

00:00:13.137 --> 00:00:16.203
natural response of this RC circuit.

00:00:16.203 --> 00:00:19.364
And we worked out that
the voltage across here,

00:00:19.364 --> 00:00:22.447
this voltage V of T on the capacitor,

00:00:24.777 --> 00:00:28.493
its natural response is
equal to V zero, V knot

00:00:28.493 --> 00:00:31.076
times e to the minus t over RC.

00:00:35.687 --> 00:00:38.579
This value of V knot
is the starting voltage

00:00:38.579 --> 00:00:41.052
that our input source provides and then it

00:00:41.052 --> 00:00:44.862
immediately steps down
to zero and this circuit

00:00:44.862 --> 00:00:46.925
then does its natural response.

00:00:46.925 --> 00:00:49.342
We got a current coming
out of this capacitor

00:00:49.342 --> 00:00:51.189
flowing around in a circle like this.

00:00:51.189 --> 00:00:54.972
And that's the natural
response of this RC circuit.

00:00:54.972 --> 00:00:57.497
I wanna look at the
properties of this function

00:00:57.497 --> 00:00:59.902
right here, it's got some
interesting properties.

00:00:59.902 --> 00:01:01.465
I'll write it right here.

00:01:01.465 --> 00:01:04.215
V knot, e to the minus t over RC.

00:01:06.763 --> 00:01:10.196
So first thing we can look
at is this V knot value.

00:01:10.196 --> 00:01:12.137
That's this value here.

00:01:12.137 --> 00:01:13.387
This is V knot.

00:01:14.268 --> 00:01:17.508
In this particular chart, V
knot was equal to one volt.

00:01:17.508 --> 00:01:19.963
That's what it originally charged up to.

00:01:19.963 --> 00:01:22.448
And now we wanna look at
this point right here.

00:01:22.448 --> 00:01:24.844
Right when it goes
through time equals zero

00:01:24.844 --> 00:01:27.869
and the curve starts to drop.

00:01:27.869 --> 00:01:31.750
We know how high it is,
it's V knot volts high.

00:01:31.750 --> 00:01:34.574
What I wanna look at
now is what's the slope

00:01:34.574 --> 00:01:36.241
right at this point?

00:01:37.928 --> 00:01:40.991
The slope of a curve is
the derivative of a curve

00:01:40.991 --> 00:01:44.234
evaluated at this time,
at time equals zero.

00:01:44.234 --> 00:01:47.423
Let's take a derivative
of our function right here

00:01:47.423 --> 00:01:48.506
so its d, dt,

00:01:51.067 --> 00:01:53.817
V knot, e to the minus t over RC.

00:01:55.781 --> 00:01:57.614
And that equals V knot

00:01:59.202 --> 00:02:03.878
and the RC comes down, minus
one over RC comes down.

00:02:03.878 --> 00:02:07.545
Minus one over RC, e
to the minus t over RC.

00:02:11.474 --> 00:02:14.186
And that's the derivative
of this exponential

00:02:14.186 --> 00:02:15.629
for all time.

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:17.068
So now we evaluate at

00:02:17.068 --> 00:02:18.151
t equals zero

00:02:20.682 --> 00:02:22.765
and we get V knot over RC

00:02:24.829 --> 00:02:26.412
and there's a minus sign.

00:02:26.412 --> 00:02:29.912
And it's e to the, I plug in zero for t,

00:02:29.912 --> 00:02:33.579
it's e to the zero and
e to the zero is one.

00:02:35.333 --> 00:02:37.416
So that equals the slope.

00:02:40.648 --> 00:02:42.877
At time equals zero, that equals the slope

00:02:42.877 --> 00:02:44.045
at time equals zero.

00:02:44.045 --> 00:02:47.148
So that's the value right here.

00:02:47.148 --> 00:02:49.206
That's what that slope looks like.

00:02:49.206 --> 00:02:51.927
That tangent line to the curve.

00:02:51.927 --> 00:02:54.411
Okay, now the next thing I wanna do

00:02:54.411 --> 00:02:58.361
is actually take this line
and extend it all the way down

00:02:58.361 --> 00:03:03.245
till it crosses this axis,
till it crosses the time axis.

00:03:03.245 --> 00:03:05.300
And the next question we're gonna ask

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.458
is what is this point right here?

00:03:07.458 --> 00:03:09.473
What's that point?

00:03:09.473 --> 00:03:11.806
Let me move up a little bit.

00:03:13.585 --> 00:03:15.709
So now we have a line,
we've defined a line.

00:03:15.709 --> 00:03:17.846
That means we have an equation of a line.

00:03:17.846 --> 00:03:22.842
So the equation of a line
is y equals slope times x

00:03:22.842 --> 00:03:27.188
plus b, b is the intercept
on the voltage axis,

00:03:27.188 --> 00:03:28.438
m is the slope.

00:03:30.167 --> 00:03:32.964
I can plug in my values
here for our chart,

00:03:32.964 --> 00:03:34.797
y is the voltage axis.

00:03:35.896 --> 00:03:38.923
We know what the slope is,
it's sitting right here.

00:03:38.923 --> 00:03:43.006
It's minus V knot over RC
and we multiply by time

00:03:44.596 --> 00:03:49.038
and we add the y intercept
or the voltage intercept

00:03:49.038 --> 00:03:52.121
which we know is V knot, plus V knot.

00:03:53.702 --> 00:03:55.705
Alright and now what
I wanna do is find out

00:03:55.705 --> 00:03:59.416
at what time, what time
does voltage equal zero

00:03:59.416 --> 00:04:01.166
for this orange line?

00:04:02.247 --> 00:04:04.241
So we're gonna plug in zero for volts

00:04:04.241 --> 00:04:05.785
and work out what time is.

00:04:05.785 --> 00:04:07.785
Zero equals V knot times

00:04:09.786 --> 00:04:13.203
one over RC and don't lose the minus sign

00:04:15.827 --> 00:04:17.244
times t plus one.

00:04:20.843 --> 00:04:23.272
If I divide both sides by V knot,

00:04:23.272 --> 00:04:28.010
I get zero on this side
and this term on this side.

00:04:28.010 --> 00:04:31.510
So I can say zero equals minus one over RC

00:04:35.185 --> 00:04:38.435
times t plus one and we wanna isolate t

00:04:40.046 --> 00:04:42.101
so we'll take the one on the other side

00:04:42.101 --> 00:04:45.198
and multiply by RC so one more step.

00:04:45.198 --> 00:04:48.781
Minus one equals minus
one over RC times t.

00:04:52.716 --> 00:04:56.383
And in the end, we come
up with t equals RC.

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:09.073
T equals RC is that time right there.

00:05:13.568 --> 00:05:17.813
That's how many seconds
after the step that this line

00:05:17.813 --> 00:05:19.396
hits the time axis.

00:05:21.718 --> 00:05:24.247
And notice something
here, there's no mention

00:05:24.247 --> 00:05:25.439
of V knot in here.

00:05:25.439 --> 00:05:26.642
There's no V knot.

00:05:26.642 --> 00:05:29.597
There's no V knot, it's not here.

00:05:29.597 --> 00:05:32.185
And it divided out in this step back here.

00:05:32.185 --> 00:05:34.659
It's one of our steps,
it disappeared going from

00:05:34.659 --> 00:05:37.047
this step to this step here.

00:05:37.047 --> 00:05:40.462
So independent of how
high this thing starts,

00:05:40.462 --> 00:05:42.361
it can be high or it can be low,

00:05:42.361 --> 00:05:46.322
the slope of this line
always goes right through

00:05:46.322 --> 00:05:47.905
the time equals RC.

00:05:51.121 --> 00:05:53.535
And one more thing we wanna work out is

00:05:53.535 --> 00:05:55.067
at time equals RC,

00:05:55.067 --> 00:05:56.484
what is the value

00:06:01.254 --> 00:06:02.386
of the exponential?

00:06:02.386 --> 00:06:06.219
What is this voltage
here when time equals RC?

00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.257
So we can use our equation again.

00:06:09.257 --> 00:06:12.464
We can plug into our equation
and find out how to do that.

00:06:12.464 --> 00:06:13.714
If I go back to

00:06:14.696 --> 00:06:18.196
V equals V knot, e to the minus t over RC,

00:06:24.351 --> 00:06:28.050
and this time we're gonna
plug in RC right here

00:06:28.050 --> 00:06:30.624
for this value here
and find out what V is.

00:06:30.624 --> 00:06:34.374
So V equals V knot, e
to the minus RC over RC

00:06:41.931 --> 00:06:45.014
or equals V knot, e to the minus one.

00:06:50.634 --> 00:06:52.220
Now the value of e

00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.137
is roughly equal to 2.7

00:06:55.531 --> 00:06:57.781
and the value of one over e

00:07:00.487 --> 00:07:02.737
is roughly equal to 0.37 or

00:07:04.905 --> 00:07:08.322
another way I can say that is 37 percent.

00:07:10.378 --> 00:07:13.545
So in the end, this voltage right here

00:07:15.374 --> 00:07:17.874
is about 37 percent of V knot.

00:07:21.869 --> 00:07:24.122
That's that value right there.

00:07:24.122 --> 00:07:25.661
So that's two little things we're gonna

00:07:25.661 --> 00:07:27.532
tuck away in our head.

00:07:27.532 --> 00:07:31.161
The time for that line to
hit the time axis is RC.

00:07:31.161 --> 00:07:34.083
If I wanna know the value
of where the exponential

00:07:34.083 --> 00:07:36.584
actually is at time equals RC,

00:07:36.584 --> 00:07:40.857
it's roughly 37 percent
of where it started from.

00:07:40.857 --> 00:07:43.412
Okay that's the basic idea and in the next

00:07:43.412 --> 00:07:46.622
video, I'll show you how
to use these ideas to

00:07:46.622 --> 00:07:49.062
sketch exponentials really quickly.
