academic institutions that have an area

00:01:34.569 --> 00:01:34.579
academic institutions that have an area
 

00:01:34.579 --> 00:01:36.789
academic institutions that have an area
of strength that is important to our

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:36.799
of strength that is important to our
 

00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:39.370
of strength that is important to our
programs so for example we have

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:39.380
programs so for example we have
 

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.020
programs so for example we have
partnered with Athens information

00:01:41.020 --> 00:01:41.030
partnered with Athens information
 

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:44.109
partnered with Athens information
technology in Athens Greece since 2002

their strength is in telecommunication

00:01:46.749 --> 00:01:46.759
their strength is in telecommunication
 

00:01:46.759 --> 00:01:49.569
their strength is in telecommunication
so they were a natural partner in

00:01:49.569 --> 00:01:49.579
so they were a natural partner in
 

00:01:49.579 --> 00:01:51.690
so they were a natural partner in
addition to that engineering and

00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:51.700
addition to that engineering and
 

00:01:51.700 --> 00:01:54.039
addition to that engineering and
telecommunications expertise that they

00:01:54.039 --> 00:01:54.049
telecommunications expertise that they
 

00:01:54.049 --> 00:01:57.370
telecommunications expertise that they
have we provide courses and coursework

00:01:57.370 --> 00:01:57.380
have we provide courses and coursework
 

00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.830
have we provide courses and coursework
and for example in strategy coming out

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840
and for example in strategy coming out
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.169
and for example in strategy coming out
of engineering and the engineering and

public policy department here so we're

00:02:05.080 --> 00:02:05.090
public policy department here so we're
 

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:06.789
public policy department here so we're
able to disseminate that kind of

00:02:06.789 --> 00:02:06.799
able to disseminate that kind of
 

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.300
able to disseminate that kind of
knowledge that they don't have

00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:08.310
knowledge that they don't have
 

00:02:08.310 --> 00:02:10.460
knowledge that they don't have
and we combine our two areas of

00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:10.470
and we combine our two areas of
 

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:14.750
and we combine our two areas of
expertise into the sum of the total

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:14.760
expertise into the sum of the total
 

00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:16.940
expertise into the sum of the total
product which is our graduate program

00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:16.950
product which is our graduate program
 

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:18.320
product which is our graduate program
the master of science and information

00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:18.330
the master of science and information
 

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:21.339
the master of science and information
