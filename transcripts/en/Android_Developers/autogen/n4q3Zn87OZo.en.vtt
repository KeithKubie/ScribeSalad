00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:07.550
 
so if you'll recall from our last lesson

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:07.560
so if you'll recall from our last lesson
 

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.879
so if you'll recall from our last lesson
we had created a method that set up all

00:00:10.879 --> 00:00:10.889
we had created a method that set up all
 

00:00:10.889 --> 00:00:12.620
we had created a method that set up all
of the appropriate properties with our

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:12.630
of the appropriate properties with our
 

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:15.709
of the appropriate properties with our
GPP sign-in object and created all the

00:00:15.709 --> 00:00:15.719
GPP sign-in object and created all the
 

00:00:15.719 --> 00:00:17.870
GPP sign-in object and created all the
appropriate delegate methods but we

00:00:17.870 --> 00:00:17.880
appropriate delegate methods but we
 

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:20.120
appropriate delegate methods but we
hadn't actually called the method that

00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:20.130
hadn't actually called the method that
 

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:22.429
hadn't actually called the method that
sets anything up or for that matter done

00:00:22.429 --> 00:00:22.439
sets anything up or for that matter done
 

00:00:22.439 --> 00:00:25.070
sets anything up or for that matter done
anything to sign the user in so let's do

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:25.080
anything to sign the user in so let's do
 

00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:27.500
anything to sign the user in so let's do
that now we're going to go back into our

00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:27.510
that now we're going to go back into our
 

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:31.189
that now we're going to go back into our
code and let's add a view today ode

00:00:31.189 --> 00:00:31.199
code and let's add a view today ode
 

00:00:31.199 --> 00:00:43.119
code and let's add a view today ode
method and we'll say super viewdidload

00:00:43.119 --> 00:00:43.129
 
 

00:00:43.129 --> 00:00:49.310
 
and then we can initialize this gpp sign

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:49.320
and then we can initialize this gpp sign
 

00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.720
and then we can initialize this gpp sign
an object and then we can take this

00:00:52.720 --> 00:00:52.730
an object and then we can take this
 

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:56.090
an object and then we can take this
shared instance and call authenticate

00:00:56.090 --> 00:00:56.100
shared instance and call authenticate
 

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.049
shared instance and call authenticate
and this is basically the call that

00:01:00.049 --> 00:01:00.059
and this is basically the call that
 

00:01:00.059 --> 00:01:02.360
and this is basically the call that
tells our sign an object ok now let's

00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:02.370
tells our sign an object ok now let's
 

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:04.939
tells our sign an object ok now let's
attempt to sign in the user so let's try

00:01:04.939 --> 00:01:04.949
attempt to sign in the user so let's try
 

00:01:04.949 --> 00:01:14.960
attempt to sign in the user so let's try
this now see what happens Hey look at

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:14.970
this now see what happens Hey look at
 

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:18.109
this now see what happens Hey look at
that we're set right into our dialogue

00:01:18.109 --> 00:01:18.119
that we're set right into our dialogue
 

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.330
that we're set right into our dialogue
now before we go on let's take a look at

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:20.340
now before we go on let's take a look at
 

00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:23.780
now before we go on let's take a look at
this URL here i'm going to select all of

00:01:23.780 --> 00:01:23.790
this URL here i'm going to select all of
 

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.399
this URL here i'm going to select all of
course turns out this doesn't actually

00:01:25.399 --> 00:01:25.409
course turns out this doesn't actually
 

00:01:25.409 --> 00:01:29.510
course turns out this doesn't actually
select all let's go from here all right

00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:29.520
select all let's go from here all right
 

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.920
select all let's go from here all right
now i'm going to copy this and let's

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:33.930
now i'm going to copy this and let's
 

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:36.530
now i'm going to copy this and let's
open up a random text file here and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:36.540
open up a random text file here and
 

00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:39.980
open up a random text file here and
paste this in and we got this giant URL

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:39.990
paste this in and we got this giant URL
 

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.670
paste this in and we got this giant URL
but let's break this up by the URL

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:43.680
but let's break this up by the URL
 

00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:54.840
but let's break this up by the URL
arguments and take a look at this thing

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:54.850
 
 

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:57.070
 
does this look kind of familiar to you

00:01:57.070 --> 00:01:57.080
does this look kind of familiar to you
 

00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.830
does this look kind of familiar to you
this URL looks pretty similar to the one

00:01:59.830 --> 00:01:59.840
this URL looks pretty similar to the one
 

00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.170
this URL looks pretty similar to the one
we had in our presentation remember this

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:02.180
we had in our presentation remember this
 

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.750
we had in our presentation remember this
one we went to accounts google com we

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:04.760
one we went to accounts google com we
 

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.610
one we went to accounts google com we
set the client ID we set the scope and

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:06.620
set the client ID we set the scope and
 

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:09.430
set the client ID we set the scope and
we said a redirect URI well now let's go

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:09.440
we said a redirect URI well now let's go
 

00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:12.250
we said a redirect URI well now let's go
back and look at our URL and you can see

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:12.260
back and look at our URL and you can see
 

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:14.500
back and look at our URL and you can see
here we have a scope we have a client ID

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:14.510
here we have a scope we have a client ID
 

00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:17.500
here we have a scope we have a client ID
and we have a redirect URI there's a few

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:17.510
and we have a redirect URI there's a few
 

00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.700
and we have a redirect URI there's a few

back look at that we're now able to make

00:02:56.800 --> 00:02:56.810
back look at that we're now able to make
 

00:02:56.810 --> 00:02:59.830
back look at that we're now able to make
sense of this giant URL so now let's go

00:02:59.830 --> 00:02:59.840
sense of this giant URL so now let's go
 

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:02.890
sense of this giant URL so now let's go
back to our simulator here and scroll

00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:02.900
back to our simulator here and scroll
 

00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:09.580
back to our simulator here and scroll
down and I'm going to click accept now

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:09.590
down and I'm going to click accept now
 

00:03:09.590 --> 00:03:11.530
down and I'm going to click accept now
at this point it redirects back to our

00:03:11.530 --> 00:03:11.540
at this point it redirects back to our
 

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:13.960
at this point it redirects back to our
application which is good right because

00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:13.970
application which is good right because
 

00:03:13.970 --> 00:03:15.940
application which is good right because
that's what we specified in our redirect

00:03:15.940 --> 00:03:15.950
that's what we specified in our redirect
 

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:18.600
that's what we specified in our redirect
URI go to com google guess my number

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:18.610
URI go to com google guess my number
 

00:03:18.610 --> 00:03:20.890
URI go to com google guess my number
however if we were to take a look at our

00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:20.900
however if we were to take a look at our
 

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:23.350
however if we were to take a look at our
console output in xcode we don't see

00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:23.360
console output in xcode we don't see
 

00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:25.750
console output in xcode we don't see
anything we didn't get to this finish

00:03:25.750 --> 00:03:25.760
anything we didn't get to this finish
 

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.940
anything we didn't get to this finish
with auth error handler and the question

00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:27.950
with auth error handler and the question
 

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.790
with auth error handler and the question
is why not well that's because while

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:30.800
is why not well that's because while
 

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:33.040
is why not well that's because while
Mobile Safari does correctly redirect

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:33.050
Mobile Safari does correctly redirect
 

00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:35.410
Mobile Safari does correctly redirect
back to our application our application

back to our application our application
does nothing to handle that URL it just

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:37.670
does nothing to handle that URL it just
 

00:03:37.670 --> 00:03:39.400
does nothing to handle that URL it just
kind of gets sent to us and we ignore it

00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:39.410
kind of gets sent to us and we ignore it
 

00:03:39.410 --> 00:03:41.140
kind of gets sent to us and we ignore it
so we need to do something about that

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.150
so we need to do something about that
 

00:03:41.150 --> 00:03:43.420
so we need to do something about that
and this is something we do within our

00:03:43.420 --> 00:03:43.430
and this is something we do within our
 

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:45.820
and this is something we do within our
app delegate so go over to your app

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:45.830
app delegate so go over to your app
 

00:03:45.830 --> 00:03:51.160
app delegate so go over to your app

delegate and let's import Google+ /
 

00:03:51.170 --> 00:03:55.090
delegate and let's import Google+ /
google plus h and we're going to add

00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.100
google plus h and we're going to add
 

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.570
google plus h and we're going to add
another method here we're going to add

annotation this is basically the method
 

00:04:05.090 --> 00:04:06.400
annotation this is basically the method
that gets called when your app

receive some sort of URL and is asked by
the system hey can you handle this it

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.050
the system hey can you handle this it
 

00:04:12.050 --> 00:04:13.570
the system hey can you handle this it
returns yes if it's able to properly

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:13.580
returns yes if it's able to properly
 

00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:16.060
returns yes if it's able to properly
handle it and returns know if it says I

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:16.070
handle it and returns know if it says I

handle it and returns know if it says I
don't really know what to do with this

00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:17.330
don't really know what to do with this
 

00:04:17.330 --> 00:04:20.590
don't really know what to do with this
thing now it turns out this method is

00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:20.600
thing now it turns out this method is
 

00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.390
thing now it turns out this method is
pretty simple because the Google+

00:04:22.390 --> 00:04:22.400
pretty simple because the Google+
 

00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:24.940
pretty simple because the Google+

so we put the cynic additional we're

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:00.650
so we put the cynic additional we're
 

00:05:00.650 --> 00:05:02.560
so we put the cynic additional we're
basically checking with Google+ and

00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:02.570
basically checking with Google+ and
 

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.840
basically checking with Google+ and
saying hey does this look like a URL you

00:05:04.840 --> 00:05:04.850
saying hey does this look like a URL you
 

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:08.370
saying hey does this look like a URL you
can handle if it does we return yes

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:08.380
can handle if it does we return yes
 

00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:12.700
can handle if it does we return yes
otherwise we'll return now in case

00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:12.710
otherwise we'll return now in case
 

00:05:12.710 --> 00:05:14.170
otherwise we'll return now in case
you're saying to yourself hey that's

00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:14.180
you're saying to yourself hey that's
 

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.210
you're saying to yourself hey that's
extra code why not just say return this

00:05:16.210 --> 00:05:16.220
extra code why not just say return this
 

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:19.060
extra code why not just say return this
the answer is that this might work if

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.070
the answer is that this might work if
 

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:21.490
the answer is that this might work if
the only URL you are ever going to check

00:05:21.490 --> 00:05:21.500
the only URL you are ever going to check
 

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.100
the only URL you are ever going to check
against is one sent from google plus but

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:24.110
against is one sent from google plus but
 

00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:25.840
against is one sent from google plus but
in reality there might be urls you're

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:25.850
in reality there might be urls you're
 

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:27.610
in reality there might be urls you're
going to want to handle so more likely

00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:27.620
going to want to handle so more likely
 

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:29.320
going to want to handle so more likely
than not there might be another else if

00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:29.330
than not there might be another else if
 

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:31.330
than not there might be another else if
here and another else if and and so on

00:05:31.330 --> 00:05:31.340
here and another else if and and so on
 

00:05:31.340 --> 00:05:33.040
here and another else if and and so on
before you finally returned now so

00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:33.050
before you finally returned now so
 

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.590
before you finally returned now so
that's why we rode it that way so now we

00:05:35.590 --> 00:05:35.600
that's why we rode it that way so now we
 

00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.560
that's why we rode it that way so now we
can run this and let's see what happens
