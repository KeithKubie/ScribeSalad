so now I'm not thinking about that

00:01:31.130 --> 00:01:31.140
so now I'm not thinking about that
 

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:32.030
so now I'm not thinking about that
that's easy

00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:32.040
that's easy
 

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:33.710

what's important is getting in a good
 

00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:36.440
what's important is getting in a good
position for this ball and just speaking

00:01:36.440 --> 00:01:36.450
position for this ball and just speaking
 

00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.359

there around there right why I have to
 

00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.280
there around there right why I have to
hit it exactly right here because that's

00:01:43.280 --> 00:01:43.290
hit it exactly right here because that's
 

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:45.499
hit it exactly right here because that's
the only way you're gonna make it if you

00:01:45.499 --> 00:01:45.509
the only way you're gonna make it if you
 

00:01:45.509 --> 00:01:48.050
the only way you're gonna make it if you
draw a line to where the ball where well

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:48.060

hit it low and just slide nauseous so
 

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:05.970
hit it low and just slide nauseous so
now from here this is pretty easy

00:03:05.970 --> 00:03:05.980
now from here this is pretty easy
 

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.650
now from here this is pretty easy
my only concern is I don't get stuck

00:03:07.650 --> 00:03:07.660
my only concern is I don't get stuck
 

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.449

00:03:16.920 --> 00:03:19.350
danger zone which is like this side rail
so I don't want to I don't want to

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:19.360
so I don't want to I don't want to
