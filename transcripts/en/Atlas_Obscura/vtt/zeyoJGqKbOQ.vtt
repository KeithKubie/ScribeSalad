00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:09.313
- If you were to Google the
world's most dangerous toy,

00:00:12.428 --> 00:00:15.200
this is actually what will
pop up on your screen:

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.780
the Atomic Energy Lab Kit by A.C. Gilbert.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:22.900
It's because it comes with
three sources of radiation

00:00:22.900 --> 00:00:25.923
and four uranium ores
that are also radioactive.

00:00:32.900 --> 00:00:35.140
My name is Voula Saridakis.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.820
I'm a curator here at the
Museum of Science and Industry

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:38.683
in Chicago.

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:42.870
Now, A.C. Gilbert claimed,
and the makers claimed,

00:00:42.870 --> 00:00:44.850
that there was nothing dangerous about it.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:49.420
It really did emit very, very
low amounts of radiation.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:52.560
But I probably would
not encourage children

00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:55.903
to hold these samples next
to their body all day long.

00:00:56.770 --> 00:00:59.980
It looks like a lovely
little red paper suitcase

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:02.370
with snakeskin (it's not snakeskin)

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.203
on the outside of the box.

00:01:03.203 --> 00:01:06.207
And when you open it, you
see this lovely picture

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:11.500
of a young man who is working
the Wilson cloud chamber.

00:01:11.500 --> 00:01:14.510
It comes with an instruction booklet,

00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:18.750
the comic book How
Dagwood Splits the Atom,

00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.950
and it comes with a book on how
to prospect uranium as well.

00:01:22.950 --> 00:01:24.890
You could use your own
Geiger counter to do that,

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.160
because the kit comes with

00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:30.320
its very own Geiger
counter, with batteries,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:34.560
and it also comes with these rubber balls

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.930
that are red and green with little rods

00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:40.327
so that you can build your
own models of alpha particles.

00:01:40.327 --> 00:01:43.970
The Wilson cloud chamber,
which you assemble,

00:01:43.970 --> 00:01:45.940
so that you could actually see

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:48.567
the vapor trails of alpha particles.

00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:51.410
The spinthariscope,
just a tube with a lens,

00:01:51.410 --> 00:01:53.610
so you look through it
and you can actually see

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:55.040
what's called scintillations,

00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:57.290
which is basically alpha decay.

00:01:57.290 --> 00:01:59.320
It also comes with an electroscope.

00:01:59.320 --> 00:02:03.150
It has a scale and indicator inside of it,

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:05.960
and you look through the
tube and you can actually see

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.730
how much ionization radiation comes from

00:02:09.730 --> 00:02:11.930
the particular source that you're using.

00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:16.100
And you can use either the
alpha, beta, or gamma sources,

00:02:16.100 --> 00:02:19.030
or you can use one of
the four uranium ores

00:02:19.030 --> 00:02:20.233
that come with the kit.

00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:25.220
They made fewer than 5,000 of these units.

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:30.190
They were only made in 1950
and 1951, and they sold poorly.

00:02:30.190 --> 00:02:32.450
They were discontinued
after only two years.

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:33.928
And the reason for that is not because

00:02:33.928 --> 00:02:36.600
of any radioactivity concerns,

00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.530
but rather because it was
expensive. It was $50,

00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:44.260
and in 1950, $50 is the equivalent

00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:48.490
of about $520 by today's standards.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.840
And that's pretty expensive.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.670
It's like a black box of
science and technology,

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:55.590
but then you open it like Pandora's box

00:02:55.590 --> 00:02:56.610
and then you play with it,

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.610
and then you realize
later on down the road

00:02:59.610 --> 00:03:02.313
that there might be some
hidden dangers there.
