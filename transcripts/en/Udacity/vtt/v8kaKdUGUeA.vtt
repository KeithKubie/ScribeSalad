Okay, edit all those things, and then hit Save again. And seems like it worked.

00:00:05.915 --> 00:00:08.572
That's cool. And it's right there in

00:00:08.572 --> 00:00:11.800
our Custom Field and Relationship, is it? Yes.

00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:12.595
&gt;&gt; There it is.

00:00:12.595 --> 00:00:13.178
&gt;&gt; Awesome.

00:00:13.178 --> 00:00:16.700
&gt;&gt; Great. So let's go to an attendee record, or both of

00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:19.500
the attendee records, and now relate them to the festival they're going to.

00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.185
&gt;&gt; Okay. Alright so if going to

00:00:22.185 --> 00:00:25.120
Johnny concert. I'm going to double click Festival.

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.812
Click my little friend, the magnifying glass. I love the

00:00:29.812 --> 00:00:32.560
magnifying glass. And send him to, what do you think?

00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:33.260
&gt;&gt; Cloud Stock.

00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:39.150
&gt;&gt; Cloud Stock. And save. Cool. And I'll do the same thing for Missy music.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.383
&gt;&gt; Awesome.
