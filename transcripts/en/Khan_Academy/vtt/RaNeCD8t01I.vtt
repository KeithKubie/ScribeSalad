00:00:00.667 --> 00:00:02.866
- [Voiceover] A secant
line intersects the curve

00:00:02.866 --> 00:00:05.013
y equals the natural log of x

00:00:05.013 --> 00:00:06.124
at two points,

00:00:06.124 --> 00:00:09.177
with x-coordinates two and two plus h.

00:00:09.177 --> 00:00:12.003
What is the slope of the secant line?

00:00:12.003 --> 00:00:14.226
Well, they're giving us
two points on this line.

00:00:14.226 --> 00:00:16.717
It might not be immediately
obvious, but they're giving us

00:00:16.717 --> 00:00:19.480
the points when x is equal to two,

00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.621
when x is equal to two, what is y?

00:00:21.621 --> 00:00:25.800
Well y, they tell us, y is
equal to the natural log of x,

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:29.783
so in this case it is going
to be the natural log of two,

00:00:29.783 --> 00:00:32.687
and when x is equal to

00:00:32.687 --> 00:00:34.377
two plus h,

00:00:34.377 --> 00:00:35.606
what is y?

00:00:35.606 --> 00:00:37.371
Well, y is always going
to be the natural log

00:00:37.371 --> 00:00:38.510
of whatever x is.

00:00:38.510 --> 00:00:43.405
So it's going to be the
natural log of two plus h.

00:00:43.405 --> 00:00:46.273
And so these are two points
that sit on the secant line.

00:00:46.273 --> 00:00:48.681
This happens to be where
the secant line intersects

00:00:48.681 --> 00:00:51.012
our curve, but these are
two points on the line,

00:00:51.012 --> 00:00:52.009
and if you know two points on a line,

00:00:52.009 --> 00:00:55.732
you will then be able to figure
out the slope of that line.

00:00:55.732 --> 00:00:57.252
Now we can just remind ourselves that

00:00:57.252 --> 00:01:01.002
a slope is just change
in y over change in x,

00:01:02.822 --> 00:01:04.645
and so what is this going to be?

00:01:04.645 --> 00:01:06.886
Well if we view the second
one as our endpoint,

00:01:06.886 --> 00:01:11.053
our change in y going from ln
of two to ln of two plus h,

00:01:12.717 --> 00:01:15.732
so our change in y is
going to be our endpoint.

00:01:15.732 --> 00:01:20.581
So, natural log of two plus
h minus our starting point,

00:01:20.581 --> 00:01:23.550
or our end y-value minus
our starting y-value.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:25.050
Natural log of two

00:01:25.893 --> 00:01:27.376
and then our change in x,

00:01:27.376 --> 00:01:31.543
our change in x is going
to be our ending x-value,

00:01:34.742 --> 00:01:39.613
two plus h, minus our starting
x-value, minus two, and

00:01:39.613 --> 00:01:43.697
of course these twos cancel
out, and if we look here

00:01:43.697 --> 00:01:46.473
it looks like we have a
choice that directly matches

00:01:46.473 --> 00:01:48.056
what we just wrote.

00:01:49.266 --> 00:01:50.099
This right over here,

00:01:50.099 --> 00:01:51.218
natural log of two plus h

00:01:51.218 --> 00:01:53.633
minus natural log of two over h.

00:01:53.633 --> 00:01:56.010
Now, if you wanna visualize
this a little bit more,

00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:00.138
we could draw a little bit,
I'm gonna clear this out

00:02:00.138 --> 00:02:02.971
so I have space to draw the graph,

00:02:04.364 --> 00:02:07.826
just so you can really visualize
that this is a secant line.

00:02:07.826 --> 00:02:09.909
So let me draw my y-axis,

00:02:11.393 --> 00:02:13.560
and let me draw my x-axis,

00:02:15.698 --> 00:02:19.227
and y equals the natural
log of x is going to look,

00:02:19.227 --> 00:02:21.819
so let me underline that,

00:02:21.819 --> 00:02:23.387
that is going to look something like this.

00:02:23.387 --> 00:02:24.971
I'm obviously hand drawing it,

00:02:24.971 --> 00:02:28.304
so not a great drawing, right over here.

00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:32.677
And so when we have the point

00:02:34.691 --> 00:02:37.108
two comma natural log of two,

00:02:38.307 --> 00:02:41.492
which would be, lets say it's over,

00:02:41.492 --> 00:02:42.992
so if this is two,

00:02:44.952 --> 00:02:47.228
then this right over here is
the natural log of two, so

00:02:47.228 --> 00:02:51.395
that's the points two comma
natural log of two, and then

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.899
we have some other, we just
noted the abstract two plus h,

00:02:55.899 --> 00:02:57.437
so it's two plus something.

00:02:57.437 --> 00:03:00.512
So let's say that is two plus h.

00:03:00.512 --> 00:03:01.602
And so this is going to be the point

00:03:01.602 --> 00:03:03.247
where we sit on the graph.

00:03:03.247 --> 00:03:06.979
That's going to be two plus
h comma the natural log of

00:03:06.979 --> 00:03:11.534
two plus h, and the exercise
we just did is finding

00:03:11.534 --> 00:03:14.802
the slope of the line
that connects these two.

00:03:14.802 --> 00:03:18.635
So the line will look
something like that, and

00:03:20.158 --> 00:03:22.295
and the way that we did
this is we figured out,

00:03:22.295 --> 00:03:24.734
okay what is our change in y?

00:03:24.734 --> 00:03:28.264
So our change in, so let's
see, we are going from

00:03:28.264 --> 00:03:31.289
y equals natural log of two to y equals

00:03:31.289 --> 00:03:33.491
natural log of two plus h.

00:03:33.491 --> 00:03:35.074
So our change in y,

00:03:37.105 --> 00:03:38.605
our change in y is

00:03:40.448 --> 00:03:42.453
our natural log of two plus h

00:03:42.453 --> 00:03:44.536
minus natural log of two.

00:03:46.616 --> 00:03:50.187
Minus natural log of
two, and our change in x?

00:03:50.187 --> 00:03:53.530
Well we're going from two to two plus h,

00:03:53.530 --> 00:03:57.697
we're going from two to two
plus h, so our change in x,

00:03:58.723 --> 00:04:00.377
we just increased by h.

00:04:00.377 --> 00:04:01.876
We're going from two to two plus h,

00:04:01.876 --> 00:04:04.383
so our change in x is equal to h.

00:04:04.383 --> 00:04:06.173
So the slope of the secant line,

00:04:06.173 --> 00:04:07.938
the slope of the secant line,

00:04:07.938 --> 00:04:10.411
a secant that intersects
our graph in two points

00:04:10.411 --> 00:04:11.530
is going to be change
in y over change in x,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:15.697
which is once again exactly
what we have over there.
