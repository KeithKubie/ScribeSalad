00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.450
Before the discovery of matches and other
modern conveniences, fires had to be started

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.610
in more primitive ways. Like rubbing sticks
together, or burning wood with a magnifying

00:00:16.610 --> 00:00:21.360
glass. But anyone who's tried these methods
know it's extremely hard work to make a fire,

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:27.320
especially in an emergency situation. Luckily,
there's a way to cheat, and it's called "Char Cloth."

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:47.640
To get started on this project, I'll sacrifice
one of my little boys shirts, and a can of

00:00:47.640 --> 00:00:52.240
tuna. This shirt is 100% cotton, and that's
what we need, so now we can focus prepping

00:00:52.250 --> 00:00:57.230
this can. I'll grab my wife's can opener and
a small screwdriver and get to work on removing

00:00:57.230 --> 00:01:01.839
the lid. The "lid lifter" cuts sideways, and
removes the top portion of the lid just below

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:06.130
the rim, and that's perfect because we'll
want it to fit back together later on. Ok,

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:10.880
the tuna comes out, and after a little cleaning,
our char cloth maker is nearly complete. Let's

00:01:10.880 --> 00:01:15.100
cut off about 4 pieces of shirt and lay them
on the lid, then the bottom of the can fits

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:19.390
over top. To finish, we can punch a small
hole in the top with this screwdriver to act

00:01:19.390 --> 00:01:24.190
as a vent hole. To char this cloth properly,
we'll need to heat this up over 400 degrees

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:29.400
Celsius, and that can be done with the Solar
Scorcher. It's about 7pm and the sun has nearly

00:01:29.409 --> 00:01:31.939
set. I've found the focal point and am happy to see there's

00:01:31.939 --> 00:01:36.759
still plenty of heat. The little flame shows
that the cotton is charing and releasing hydrogen

00:01:36.759 --> 00:01:40.960
and methane gasses through the hole in the
top. Alright, the flame just went out, so

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.810
that means it's done, and we'll need to carefully
cover the hole with some aluminum foil to

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.990
prevent air from leaking in and causing a
flashback. Now that it's cooled down, we can

00:01:48.990 --> 00:01:54.770
remove the foil and the cover to see how our
cloth turned out. It's completely black. Totally

00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:58.850
charred, but not burned, and that's just what
we needed. The fabric's still pliable, but

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.450
is now extremely sensitive to heat. Just a
few seconds with the sun and a water bottle,

00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:08.890
and we can easily make a fire! Your water bottle can also be used to make a fire without the char cloth but

00:02:08.890 --> 00:02:13.820
it takes a lot longer, and is much more difficult. Ok, so it's the next day and I'm making another

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.180
batch, this time with an open flame! This
method works super well and only takes about

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.160
2 minutes to cook all the gasses out of the
fabric. When it's cooled down and the foil

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:26.140
is off, i'm really impressed at how much the
fabric has shrunk from the original size.

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.420
Now I'm wondering if cotton balls will work,
so my little boy is helping load a batch,

00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:34.710
and after 2 minutes in the fire they're all
done. They're looking great and I'm interested

00:02:34.710 --> 00:02:39.430
to see how they'll compare to the cotton fabric.
To test the quality, let's brush the side

00:02:39.430 --> 00:02:44.850
with a flame, and blow gently to see if it
glows. Success! This fabric ignites amazingly

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.700
fast, and burns impressively slowly. From
this point, all it takes to get a flame is

00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:55.650
to add something flammable, like this paper,
and blow. Haha FIRE! These charred cotton

00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.960
balls work so well, and are so cheap and accessible,
that I think from now on I'm going to use

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:04.710
them exclusively in my Fire Piston. You can see how to build this in a different video.

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:10.110
I also tried making Char Cloth using another
fabric and a mint tin, a glass baby food jar,

00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:15.980
and an Altoids tin. Overall, I was most impressed
with my tuna can, an open flame, and a handful

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:20.400
of cotton balls. Well there's another item
for my emergency kit and a fun project with

00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:25.370
my kids. That's it for now. If you liked this
project, perhaps you'll like some of my others.
