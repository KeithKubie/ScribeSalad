00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Here is my answer.

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
In the omega, I replace all the 1's by 5's so we add 5, -5, -5, and 5 over here.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:12.000
I also multiplied the measurement by 5. If you forget this, you get a very kooky answer.

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
You have to adjust these things over here in the same proportion

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000
as the guys over here with a 5.

00:00:18.000 --> 09:59:59.000
That gives you the result that I stated.
