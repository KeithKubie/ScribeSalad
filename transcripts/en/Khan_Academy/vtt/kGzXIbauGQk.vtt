00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:04.270
Move the orange dot
to negative 2 plus 2i.

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.690
So we have a
complex number here.

00:00:05.690 --> 00:00:07.380
It has a real part, negative 2.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:10.520
It has an imaginary
part, you have 2 times i.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.020
And what you see
here is we're going

00:00:12.020 --> 00:00:14.650
to plot it on this
two-dimensional grid,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:16.600
but it's not our
traditional coordinate axes.

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:18.058
In our traditional
coordinate axis,

00:00:18.058 --> 00:00:22.440
you're plotting a real x value
versus a real y-coordinate.

00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:24.320
Here on the horizontal
axis, that's

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:26.570
going to be the real part
of our complex number.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:29.460
And our vertical axis is going
to be the imaginary part.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.240
So in this example,
this complex number,

00:00:31.240 --> 00:00:33.900
our real part is the
negative 2 and then

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:36.460
our imaginary part
is a positive 2.

00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.720
And so that right over
there in the complex plane

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.940
is the point negative 2 plus 2i.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.160
Let's do a few more of these.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.100
So 5 plus 2i.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:50.420
Once again, real part is
5, imaginary part is 2,

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:52.020
and we're done.

00:00:52.020 --> 00:00:53.630
Let's do two more of these.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:55.310
1 plus 5i.

00:00:55.310 --> 00:01:00.632
1-- that's the real part--
plus 5i right over that Im.

00:01:00.632 --> 00:01:03.360
All right, let's do
one more of these.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:05.099
4 minus 4i.

00:01:05.099 --> 00:01:08.690
Real part is 4, imaginary
part is negative 4.

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:13.420
And we're done.
