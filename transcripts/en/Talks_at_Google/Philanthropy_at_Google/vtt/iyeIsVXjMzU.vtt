00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.381
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:05.796 --> 00:00:08.694
[APPLAUSE]

00:00:09.364 --> 00:00:10.030
JOE HUSTON: Yes.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:12.500
So thank you, guys,
so much for having me.

00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:14.650
In general, Google
was super early

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.610
in supporting GiveDirectly and
the Google community broadly

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:21.460
and in helping people out who
are extremely poor by sending

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.630
cash through our platform.

00:00:22.630 --> 00:00:25.976
And so we've always felt really
close to the Google community.

00:00:25.976 --> 00:00:28.600
And it's nice to be able to come
back and talk about what we're

00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:31.570
up to, some of the
debates that are happening

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:35.290
within the development and other
sectors, and how cash, I think,

00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:36.790
is moving those forward.

00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:41.429
As Max said, I've worn a few
different hats at GiveDirectly.

00:00:41.429 --> 00:00:42.970
When I first started
at GiveDirectly,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:45.190
I was in Kenya on
the operations side,

00:00:45.190 --> 00:00:48.580
managing our team, signing
people up to receive cash.

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:52.130
I spent a year and a half or so
there, about a year and a half

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:54.280
in Uganda, and just
recently switched back

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:55.900
over to the finance
side in New York.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.390
And what GiveDirectly does
is pretty straight forward.

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:05.530
We send cash unconditionally
to people living mostly

00:01:05.530 --> 00:01:07.270
in extreme poverty.

00:01:07.270 --> 00:01:08.660
That cash is a grant.

00:01:08.660 --> 00:01:09.730
It's not a loan.

00:01:09.730 --> 00:01:12.060
People can spend it
however they want.

00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:16.150
In the most typical model,
we will send about $1,000

00:01:16.150 --> 00:01:18.460
in a couple of chunks over
the course of a few months.

00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:21.820
And then people spend it
on whatever they want.

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:24.460
In total, we've raised
almost $150 million

00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.290
to deliver as cash transfers.

00:01:26.290 --> 00:01:29.230
And we've enrolled
over 80,000 households.

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:31.840
Because our operations are
fairly straightforward,

00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:33.460
we're able to stay
remarkably lean.

00:01:33.460 --> 00:01:35.740
And so, on average,
about 90% of what

00:01:35.740 --> 00:01:38.620
we raise for cash transfers
gets delivered directly

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:41.260
to people's hands at
the end of the day.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:43.150
And then as we're
doing all of this work,

00:01:43.150 --> 00:01:44.816
we're constantly
running different types

00:01:44.816 --> 00:01:45.850
of research studies.

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:47.620
And so when we first
got started in Kenya,

00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:49.240
we ran a randomized
controlled trial

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.390
testing a bunch of different
things about cash transfers--

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:58.090
comparing large lump sum cash
transfers to recurring stream

00:01:58.090 --> 00:02:02.050
transfers, testing whether or
not male recipients spend money

00:02:02.050 --> 00:02:04.506
differently from
female recipients,

00:02:04.506 --> 00:02:06.130
as well as the effect
of cash transfers

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:08.740
on a ton of different
outcome variables, earnings

00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:10.780
and assets, consumption,
but also things

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.177
like stress and depression
and things like that.

00:02:13.177 --> 00:02:15.760
Since then, we've done a number
of different research studies.

00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:18.670
We can talk about things like
looking at the effects of cash

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.730
transfers on macro--

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:23.140
the macro aspects
of the economy--

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:27.130
behavioral aspects
of cash transfers,

00:02:27.130 --> 00:02:29.530
how cash transfers
affect coffee farmers,

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:33.310
and how they invest in their
farms and things like that.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:37.330
Operationally, the process looks
a lot like a sales and customer

00:02:37.330 --> 00:02:38.630
service operations.

00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.750
We'll go door to
door and collect data

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.640
on the people who
could potentially

00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:46.420
receive cash transfers,
run a pretty simple logic

00:02:46.420 --> 00:02:48.934
to decide who is
eligible, then go back

00:02:48.934 --> 00:02:50.350
and collect a
little bit more data

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:53.430
and inform them
about the program.

00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.140
We'll then send the money,
typically through Mobile Money.

00:02:56.140 --> 00:02:58.330
And so that looks
like Venmo, but you're

00:02:58.330 --> 00:03:01.480
able to cash out basically
anywhere around you.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:03.730
And we can send
thousands of payments

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:06.536
with a touch on a laptop.

00:03:06.536 --> 00:03:08.160
And then we have full
time call centers

00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:09.980
in each of the
countries where we work.

00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:11.860
And so after every
time we send payments,

00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.068
we're able to call people
up and confirm that they've

00:03:14.068 --> 00:03:16.660
received it, ask if they have
any feedback for GiveDirectly,

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.451
and understand if
they've had any problems.

00:03:20.790 --> 00:03:24.290
Now that model of just
giving unconditional cash

00:03:24.290 --> 00:03:27.710
is very different from how
we're taught through aphorisms

00:03:27.710 --> 00:03:30.680
or parables about how we're
supposed to approach giving.

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:33.230
There's this idea that you're
supposed to teach a man to fish

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:34.640
or not give him a fish.

00:03:34.640 --> 00:03:38.610
Or that you should give a
hand up but not a handout.

00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.210
And I think behind that, there's
this idea that giving cash

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.620
can't be sustainable.

00:03:42.620 --> 00:03:45.350
And there's also this idea
that we should distrust

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:49.370
the people we're trying to help
somehow, that giving them money

00:03:49.370 --> 00:03:50.630
could be corrupting.

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:52.340
Or if it's not
corrupting, that we just

00:03:52.340 --> 00:03:56.060
can't trust from the outset
that it could be spent well.

00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.190
Behind that basic
debate, the stakes

00:03:58.190 --> 00:04:00.800
are actually remarkably
high between how we

00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.810
should approach helping people.

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:04.730
To give you a sense,
this is one way

00:04:04.730 --> 00:04:09.420
of visualizing
what's up for debate.

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.360
The blue line is global
official development assistance.

00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.120
It's one measure of
this total amount

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:17.000
that governments are
spending in foreign aid.

00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.100
The line that's
going down over time

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.740
is the cost of closing
the poverty gap.

00:04:21.740 --> 00:04:23.690
You can think of this
as taking everyone

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.820
who is below the
global poverty line

00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:28.790
and visualizing how much in
cash it would take to get them

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.145
to the poverty line.

00:04:30.145 --> 00:04:31.520
Now, there's a
lot of reasons why

00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.670
that's a simplistic
picture of what's going on.

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.810
But the basic synthesis is that
we have incredible resources

00:04:38.810 --> 00:04:41.440
available to help the
people we're trying to help,

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.760
to help the people
in extreme poverty.

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:47.120
And a lot of the problem
of aid and development

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:48.860
is an allocation
one-- that it's not

00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:50.390
so much that we
need more resources,

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:52.260
but we need to
better allocate them.

00:04:52.260 --> 00:04:54.350
And so this debate
about how best should we

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.430
help people is actually
extremely important.

00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:01.000
So luckily, we
don't have to have

00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:06.070
this debate in this arena
of dueling assertions.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:08.590
It doesn't have to be this
theoretical or philosophical

00:05:08.590 --> 00:05:10.900
debate about what
people are really like.

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.420
We can test it.

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:14.950
A development that's happened
over this last couple

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:17.680
of decades within
development economics

00:05:17.680 --> 00:05:19.720
is moving a little
bit away from theory

00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:24.820
towards actually putting things
into experimental evaluations.

00:05:24.820 --> 00:05:26.620
And so the gold standard
approach to this

00:05:26.620 --> 00:05:29.010
is what's called a
randomized control trial.

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:30.760
It's the same way that
we test medicines--

00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:33.820
by randomly assigning people
to either receive or not

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:36.735
receive a treatment and then
using external evaluators

00:05:36.735 --> 00:05:40.510
to test the differences in the
different outcome variables

00:05:40.510 --> 00:05:42.126
between those two groups.

00:05:42.126 --> 00:05:43.750
We've learned a lot
of different things

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:46.545
from that about different
interventions we use.

00:05:46.545 --> 00:05:47.920
We've learned that
we're actually

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:51.610
pretty bad at training people
or teaching people to fish.

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:53.830
The effects of
microfinance and things

00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.660
like that are
actually pretty mixed.

00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:57.910
We've also learned that
the effects of cash

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:02.770
are remarkably consistent,
that the exact impacts can vary

00:06:02.770 --> 00:06:05.680
a lot by the structure
of the cash transfers

00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:08.650
or the people who are
receiving them or the context.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.120
But you see a few
consistent themes.

00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:13.240
First, people spend
it pretty well.

00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.180
You see increases in
earnings and consumption,

00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.600
decreases in food insecurity,
improvements in nutrition,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.780
often increases an uptake on
things like health services

00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.690
or actual improvements in health
in terms of fewer accidents

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.230
or better health.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.440
You see decreases in stress.

00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:32.500
To give you a sense of
the variety of responses

00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.440
to cash or to security,
one study in Malawi

00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:38.470
tested giving the
families of young women

00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:41.470
a small recurring cash
payments-- so just a little bit

00:06:41.470 --> 00:06:43.900
of security, not a
total game changer.

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.500
What they found is that those
women whose families received

00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.790
got married later,
pregnant later,

00:06:49.790 --> 00:06:52.810
and had lower rates of HIV
relative to the control group.

00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:56.350
Because they had a little
bit more security in society.

00:06:56.350 --> 00:06:58.790
On the other side
of the spectrum,

00:06:58.790 --> 00:07:03.750
a study testing giving young
people about $400 all at once,

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:06.610
if they went back and
compared that group of people

00:07:06.610 --> 00:07:08.740
to a control group, and
found that their earnings

00:07:08.740 --> 00:07:10.450
were 40% higher.

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:13.360
That basic result was mirrored
in GiveDirectly study that

00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:16.450
found that a year after
people received about $1,000,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:18.910
their earnings were 30%
higher and their assets

00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.970
were 58% higher.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:24.190
The other things you
don't see are the things

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.657
people are often worried about.

00:07:25.657 --> 00:07:27.740
There is this sense that
if you give people money,

00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:28.690
they might drink it.

00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.690
Or it will be corrupting,
and they'll stop working.

00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:33.820
But all of the evidence
we have from what's

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:38.170
been 165 different studies of
cash transfers, which suggest

00:07:38.170 --> 00:07:39.760
that that doesn't happen.

00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:43.840
The studies have found that
this consumption of, quote,

00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.390
"temptation goods"-- things
like alcohol or tobacco

00:07:46.390 --> 00:07:49.480
or gambling-- either has stayed
the same for cash recipients

00:07:49.480 --> 00:07:50.780
or has gone down.

00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:53.230
And similarly, the work effort--
how much time people are

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:54.520
spending working--

00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.346
has either stayed
the same or gone up

00:07:56.346 --> 00:07:57.970
in the different
studies that have been

00:07:57.970 --> 00:08:01.760
done in the developing world.

00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:05.440
The other thing that's
happened more recently

00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.380
over the last decade
is an explosion

00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:09.130
in mobile money, which
has made delivering

00:08:09.130 --> 00:08:11.160
cash transfers a lot easier.

00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:13.700
And so today, there are 93
countries with mobile money

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.630
and over 400 million
current mobile money users.

00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:19.960
That makes this job of getting
cash into people's hands pretty

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:21.290
easy.

00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:22.960
And the mobile
money infrastructure

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:25.660
doesn't have to
be as robust as it

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:28.000
is in Kenya, which has the
best network in the world.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.330
It can actually be
pretty lightweight.

00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:34.330
A study we did in
Uganda tested the limits

00:08:34.330 --> 00:08:36.940
to say, how good does the
payments infrastructure have

00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:38.860
to be for mobile
payments to work?

00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:41.620
And so we found just about
the most remote place

00:08:41.620 --> 00:08:42.820
you could go to in Uganda--

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:45.370
a place very, very
North in the country,

00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.080
just on the border
with South Sudan--

00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.910
where people typically
would walk something

00:08:48.910 --> 00:08:51.670
like four or five hours to
get to the nearest town,

00:08:51.670 --> 00:08:54.470
which was also where the
nearest paved road would be.

00:08:54.470 --> 00:08:57.100
We found that if you sent mobile
money to a place that actually

00:08:57.100 --> 00:08:59.980
didn't have any mobile money
providers there already,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.660
this market responded-- that the
market incentives for cashing

00:09:04.660 --> 00:09:05.920
people out worked.

00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:09.340
And agents came to the
village to cash people out.

00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:13.210
And so this technology exists
to get cash into people's hands

00:09:13.210 --> 00:09:16.200
really, really cheaply.

00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:18.450
As a result of those,
there are two trends.

00:09:18.450 --> 00:09:20.220
There's a ton of
different applications

00:09:20.220 --> 00:09:23.190
where we can use cash
transfers to solve or address

00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:25.325
a bunch of different
types of problems.

00:09:25.325 --> 00:09:26.700
And so to give
you a sense, these

00:09:26.700 --> 00:09:29.700
are some of the projects
GiveDirectly is working on

00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:31.210
around the world.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:33.590
And so the first one is the
thing we've done most often.

00:09:33.590 --> 00:09:37.085
It's these large one time
cash grants of about $1,000.

00:09:37.085 --> 00:09:38.460
And I think these
are best geared

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.850
if you want to give
people investment capital.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:43.770
And so you see bigger
increases in earnings

00:09:43.770 --> 00:09:48.310
that expect large increases in
assets and things like that.

00:09:48.310 --> 00:09:51.200
You can also use cash transfers
to address humanitarian issues.

00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:53.494
And so we just started
a project in Uganda,

00:09:53.494 --> 00:09:55.410
which has taken in a lot
of different refugees

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:57.120
from surrounding countries.

00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:59.670
The typical approach to
these types of crises

00:09:59.670 --> 00:10:03.690
is to pay people who run
settlement camps per head

00:10:03.690 --> 00:10:06.090
by this number of people
they're supporting.

00:10:06.090 --> 00:10:08.550
And while that seems intuitive,
the incentives are all off.

00:10:08.550 --> 00:10:10.770
Because the incentives
are to keep people alive,

00:10:10.770 --> 00:10:13.810
but not support them to
move on with their lives.

00:10:13.810 --> 00:10:15.720
And so the test
we're doing in Uganda

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:19.110
now is giving people about
$750 and letting them

00:10:19.110 --> 00:10:21.360
to spend it however they want.

00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:25.231
You can also use cash for things
like a universal basic income.

00:10:25.231 --> 00:10:27.480
And so I'm sure we'll talk
about this more in Q and A.

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:30.090
But the basic idea here is
if you want to make sure

00:10:30.090 --> 00:10:33.120
that everybody is living up to
a certain standard of living,

00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.220
one way to kind of
mechanically insure

00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:38.370
that is to give everyone a
cash transfer equal to the cost

00:10:38.370 --> 00:10:40.000
of that standard of living.

00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.500
And so GiveDirectly
just launched

00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:44.580
to study in Kenya distributing
different types of cash

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.040
transfers to about
16,000 people,

00:10:47.040 --> 00:10:49.380
with some people receiving
a universal basic income

00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.570
for up to 12 years.

00:10:51.570 --> 00:10:53.910
On the other side
of the spectrum,

00:10:53.910 --> 00:10:56.766
you can use cash transfers for
things like disaster relief.

00:10:56.766 --> 00:10:58.140
And so something
GiveDirectly did

00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:00.780
this year is launch in
Texas and Puerto Rico

00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:03.995
and hand people out debit
cards for about $1,500.

00:11:03.995 --> 00:11:05.370
That's not a life
changing amount

00:11:05.370 --> 00:11:07.240
of money in either
of those places.

00:11:07.240 --> 00:11:08.940
But it does help
sort of fill the gaps

00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:12.240
in terms of what people aren't
receiving from the existing

00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.490
support network or the existing
NGOs doing disaster relief.

00:11:15.490 --> 00:11:18.120
And it lets people buy
whatever is their top priority

00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:20.470
within that price range.

00:11:20.470 --> 00:11:22.320
There's a big
industry that exists

00:11:22.320 --> 00:11:25.560
around things like fair
trade or CSR for companies

00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:28.210
to try to give back to the
people they are working with.

00:11:28.210 --> 00:11:30.940
And so one thing we're testing
with a sort of foundation

00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.050
arm of a coffee company is
just giving cash transfers

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.130
in a coffee growing area.

00:11:36.130 --> 00:11:39.060
And so we're working
in eastern Uganda.

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:41.650
Picked an area which is
growing a lot of coffee and

00:11:41.650 --> 00:11:45.090
are giving people about
the same $1,000 cash grants

00:11:45.090 --> 00:11:47.737
and seeing how it in
general changes their lives,

00:11:47.737 --> 00:11:49.320
as well as how it
changes their coffee

00:11:49.320 --> 00:11:52.560
growing practices, whether
they start doing longer term

00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.360
practices and how they
approach the plants

00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:55.756
and things like that.

00:11:55.756 --> 00:11:58.380
And this last thing is a project
that I'm really excited about,

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:00.600
which is something we're
doing with USAID in Rwanda

00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:03.600
and potentially other
countries, which is using cash

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.559
as a literal benchmark for
their existing programming.

00:12:06.559 --> 00:12:08.850
And so we're running side by
side randomized controlled

00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:13.780
trials in Rwanda, testing
for goals that they have.

00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:16.500
And so in one case,
it's a nutrition program

00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:19.440
that has specific nutrition
goals how we could structure

00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:22.920
a cash transfer program
designed to meet those goals

00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:26.430
and basically produce a report
card answering the question.

00:12:26.430 --> 00:12:28.244
Is the programming
you're doing better

00:12:28.244 --> 00:12:30.660
than just giving the people
you're trying to help the cash

00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.040
and letting them spend it?

00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:35.490
And so that provides a literal
benchmark for us to say,

00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.260
are we allocating
money correctly?

00:12:40.417 --> 00:12:42.670
And so something that's been
happening in this sector

00:12:42.670 --> 00:12:45.770
as we've had this mountain
of evidence build up

00:12:45.770 --> 00:12:48.010
and as the logistics
of delivering cash

00:12:48.010 --> 00:12:50.650
has become a lot easier
is that the rhetoric

00:12:50.650 --> 00:12:52.180
has changed dramatically.

00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:55.120
It's less so that the
idea of giving cash

00:12:55.120 --> 00:12:58.319
is seen as crazy or
nuts or corrupting.

00:12:58.319 --> 00:13:00.610
And instead, you see things
like this from Ban-Ki Moon.

00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:02.110
He said that cash
programming should

00:13:02.110 --> 00:13:04.990
be the preferred and
default method of support.

00:13:04.990 --> 00:13:07.610
A different sort of summary
of the evidence on cash

00:13:07.610 --> 00:13:09.610
called it perhaps the
most thoroughly researched

00:13:09.610 --> 00:13:11.410
intervention out there.

00:13:11.410 --> 00:13:14.110
And so that's actually
extremely exciting,

00:13:14.110 --> 00:13:16.420
except that the
funding hasn't changed.

00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.690
If you look at the overall
portfolio of how we're

00:13:19.690 --> 00:13:21.620
spending our money
to help people,

00:13:21.620 --> 00:13:23.980
it's still spent mostly
not by the recipients

00:13:23.980 --> 00:13:26.290
we're trying to help, and
instead by policymakers

00:13:26.290 --> 00:13:29.440
and bureaucrats and donors
in places like New York

00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.910
or D.C. or London.

00:13:30.910 --> 00:13:34.090
And so less than 1% of US
aid funding is cash-based.

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:37.420
Less than 2% funding of UK
aid funding is cash-based.

00:13:37.420 --> 00:13:40.840
And the same is true in the
humanitarian sectors as well.

00:13:40.840 --> 00:13:43.180
And I'll pause to note
that the rest of the pie

00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:45.290
is not the give
well top charities.

00:13:45.290 --> 00:13:48.460
That's not the kind of most
evidence type interventions

00:13:48.460 --> 00:13:49.210
out there.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:51.545
There's a remarkable
inertia in the sector

00:13:51.545 --> 00:13:52.920
that we're still
trying to fight.

00:13:55.830 --> 00:13:58.650
And the consequence is
that because we're not

00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:01.470
solving the allocation
problem at the front,

00:14:01.470 --> 00:14:03.030
it gets solved on
the back end a lot.

00:14:03.030 --> 00:14:05.280
And so you see things like
this from one refugee camp

00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.396
where 70% of Syrian refugees
were selling portions

00:14:08.396 --> 00:14:10.770
of food aid they were receiving
to get what they actually

00:14:10.770 --> 00:14:11.680
wanted.

00:14:11.680 --> 00:14:13.380
And so the markets
are still responding

00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:16.740
to try to correct the allocation
but only further and further

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:20.730
down the chain after we've
shipped food from other places

00:14:20.730 --> 00:14:22.879
into the country.

00:14:22.879 --> 00:14:24.170
And so what can we do about it?

00:14:24.170 --> 00:14:27.190
We have these really
effective tools.

00:14:27.190 --> 00:14:28.180
We have this evidence.

00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.810
As donors, how can we
approach this basic problem?

00:14:31.810 --> 00:14:34.360
Well, part of this
stagnation in the sector

00:14:34.360 --> 00:14:37.480
is that it doesn't
respond how like consumer

00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:39.970
goods or, in general, a
market economy respond.

00:14:39.970 --> 00:14:42.130
And so if you look at
a phone like a product,

00:14:42.130 --> 00:14:44.740
we've had remarkable innovation.

00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:49.210
We've gone from this rotary dial
landline phones to the iPhone X

00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:50.242
or something like that.

00:14:50.242 --> 00:14:52.450
And the reason is because
there are market incentives

00:14:52.450 --> 00:14:54.896
to respond to the consumer.

00:14:54.896 --> 00:14:56.770
Well, the problem with
the development sector

00:14:56.770 --> 00:14:59.050
is that the donor is
the person who pays.

00:14:59.050 --> 00:15:01.330
But the recipient is the
person who is affected.

00:15:01.330 --> 00:15:03.580
And so you don't see the
same types of incentives

00:15:03.580 --> 00:15:06.240
exist to have the same
type of innovation.

00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:09.910
And so you often see persistence
in the same types of tools

00:15:09.910 --> 00:15:12.260
that we use again and again.

00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.330
And so somehow we have
to become better donors.

00:15:15.330 --> 00:15:18.539
And so these are three questions
you can use to force that

00:15:18.539 --> 00:15:20.080
and to force the
organizations you're

00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:24.040
working with to be more and more
responsive to the people you

00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.009
and they are trying to help.

00:15:26.009 --> 00:15:27.550
The first one is
trying to understand

00:15:27.550 --> 00:15:30.850
what the end-to-end cost
of the intervention is.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:33.850
How much of your donation
actually ends up in value

00:15:33.850 --> 00:15:36.310
provided to the recipient
at the end of the road?

00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:38.690
Now, there's lots of problems
with overhead metrics

00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:39.770
and things like that.

00:15:39.770 --> 00:15:41.087
And this is not that.

00:15:41.087 --> 00:15:42.670
A problem with the
sector is that it's

00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:44.230
heavily intermediated.

00:15:44.230 --> 00:15:46.360
And so one nonprofit
will take your donation

00:15:46.360 --> 00:15:48.970
and give it to another
nonprofit after sort of skimming

00:15:48.970 --> 00:15:50.037
a little bit off the top.

00:15:50.037 --> 00:15:52.120
They'll skim a little bit
off the top for overhead

00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.920
and give it to
another nonprofit.

00:15:53.920 --> 00:15:56.650
And even if the reported
overhead is very low,

00:15:56.650 --> 00:15:59.532
each of those nonprofits
only taking about 1%,

00:15:59.532 --> 00:16:02.740
the systemic overhead
is extraordinarily high.

00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.080
If you have a chain of
those nonprofits repeatedly

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.330
subgranting to each
other, the end value

00:16:07.330 --> 00:16:09.930
that's reaching the recipient
is actually very, very low.

00:16:09.930 --> 00:16:12.430
And that's a practice that you
see again and again and again

00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.110
in the sector.

00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:17.860
The next thing is
evidence backing.

00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:20.920
Has there been an external
randomized controlled trial

00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.950
of this sort of intervention the
organization is implementing?

00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:25.822
How do we actually
know that it works?

00:16:25.822 --> 00:16:27.280
And use the same
standard you would

00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.320
want for a medicine
you would take

00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:32.240
or a product that you
would bet your life on.

00:16:32.240 --> 00:16:34.810
And lastly, there's
this benchmark question.

00:16:34.810 --> 00:16:37.600
Is the funding you're
providing to the organization

00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:39.400
and the program that
they're implementing

00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.280
doing more good than the people
you're actually trying to help

00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:44.134
could if you just
gave them the cash?

00:16:44.134 --> 00:16:46.300
Now, there's plenty of
interventions that might meet

00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.150
that standard-- very specialized
medical interventions,

00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:53.450
for example, or cases where
there's a public good problem--

00:16:53.450 --> 00:16:55.400
infrastructure, or
maybe rule of law.

00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.712
There's a particularly good
giving opportunity there.

00:16:57.712 --> 00:16:59.170
But a lot of the
things we're doing

00:16:59.170 --> 00:17:02.140
are trying to outspend
the poor about things

00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:03.790
that they know far more about.

00:17:03.790 --> 00:17:06.640
And so I think a lot of
the spending we're doing

00:17:06.640 --> 00:17:10.732
wouldn't meet this
sort of basic test.

00:17:10.732 --> 00:17:12.190
I think the last
thing that's worth

00:17:12.190 --> 00:17:13.849
pausing on before
we go to Q and A

00:17:13.849 --> 00:17:15.640
and dig into a bunch
of other things

00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.130
is why is it worth
giving at all.

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.859
And here I would
say the existence

00:17:20.859 --> 00:17:23.630
of incredible opportunities
to have impact.

00:17:23.630 --> 00:17:24.859
I think cash is one of those.

00:17:24.859 --> 00:17:26.400
But there's lots of
other non-profits

00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:27.819
that are actually
doing good work.

00:17:27.819 --> 00:17:30.820
Provides a pretty
amazing opportunity

00:17:30.820 --> 00:17:33.280
to do something
great with your life

00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.460
that almost as a side product
of your day-to-day life

00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:39.040
by donating a certain
small percent.

00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:42.160
Your life can be basically the
same, except as a side product,

00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.370
you can dramatically change
and better lives of people who

00:17:45.370 --> 00:17:46.880
are living in extreme poverty.

00:17:46.880 --> 00:17:52.030
And that's a cool opportunity to
do with your 80 years on earth.

00:17:52.030 --> 00:17:57.700
And so I think despite the
dark look on the sector,

00:17:57.700 --> 00:18:01.210
I think there is this incredible
opportunity out there provided

00:18:01.210 --> 00:18:05.530
by good giving opportunities
that make giving worth doing.

00:18:05.530 --> 00:18:07.630
And so with that, I'll
turn it over to questions

00:18:07.630 --> 00:18:09.130
and looking forward
to conversation.

00:18:09.130 --> 00:18:10.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:18:10.870 --> 00:18:12.910
SPEAKER 1: I actually
want to start with just

00:18:12.910 --> 00:18:14.390
a question about your own role.

00:18:14.390 --> 00:18:16.007
So this is amazing work.

00:18:16.007 --> 00:18:17.590
I mean, for example,
the Malawi thing,

00:18:17.590 --> 00:18:20.030
I just learned about
that yesterday about HIV.

00:18:20.030 --> 00:18:23.320
So you keep learning new things
about cash transfers, which

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:24.250
are amazing.

00:18:24.250 --> 00:18:27.340
But I'm curious from
the financial angle,

00:18:27.340 --> 00:18:28.767
what kind of unique problems--

00:18:28.767 --> 00:18:30.850
I imagine there are some--
that GiveDirectly deals

00:18:30.850 --> 00:18:33.270
with that you're exposed to?

00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:35.351
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:18:35.351 --> 00:18:37.950
In a lot of ways,
it's focusing to just

00:18:37.950 --> 00:18:41.580
be able to spend most of your
time on the cash pipeline.

00:18:41.580 --> 00:18:43.470
And so on the
finance side, my job

00:18:43.470 --> 00:18:47.330
is to manage that entire
pipeline from donor

00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.910
to the first bank it hits in
the US to the foreign exchange

00:18:50.910 --> 00:18:54.320
transaction to get to Kenyan
shillings or Rwandan francs,

00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.086
the bank it sits there, and then
the getting to the mobile money

00:18:57.086 --> 00:18:58.710
provider and to the
eventual recipient.

00:18:58.710 --> 00:19:00.930
And so the problems
there are to first,

00:19:00.930 --> 00:19:04.080
make sure that that pipeline
is as short as possible,

00:19:04.080 --> 00:19:06.840
that money moves through the
system incredibly quickly.

00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:08.820
And so problems we're
sort of working on

00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:11.160
within that domain
are things like how

00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.920
do we project donations
that we can keep field

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:16.310
operations running basically
just behind them so

00:19:16.310 --> 00:19:18.600
that the lag is very small?

00:19:18.600 --> 00:19:21.095
Second, how do we manage
that cash prudently,

00:19:21.095 --> 00:19:23.220
make sure we're getting an
interest where we should

00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:24.455
and things like that?

00:19:24.455 --> 00:19:25.830
And then third,
making sure we're

00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:28.740
managing fraud, on
the internal side

00:19:28.740 --> 00:19:31.097
with staff and things
like that and externally

00:19:31.097 --> 00:19:33.180
with mobile money providers,
with local government

00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:34.054
and things like that.

00:19:34.054 --> 00:19:35.940
And so the integrity
of the pipeline

00:19:35.940 --> 00:19:38.400
is something I spend a
lot of time on as well.

00:19:38.400 --> 00:19:39.580
SPEAKER 1: Cool.

00:19:39.580 --> 00:19:41.720
[INAUDIBLE] I'm actually
going to set up the Dory.

00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.635
Just one moment.

00:19:46.299 --> 00:19:47.836
AUDIENCE: Yeah, I'll go.

00:19:47.836 --> 00:19:49.580
Hey.

00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:54.950
My question is about whether
an organization like yours

00:19:54.950 --> 00:19:59.480
pays a different amount than a
giant multinational corporation

00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.230
like Google does to
change currencies?

00:20:03.230 --> 00:20:05.720
It seems like something that's
really important to the flow

00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:08.450
of money in this organization.

00:20:08.450 --> 00:20:11.390
And I wonder if
there's an opportunity

00:20:11.390 --> 00:20:14.870
for multinational
corporations to help out

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:17.430
not just by matching
employees donations,

00:20:17.430 --> 00:20:22.010
but maybe to assist
with currency exchange

00:20:22.010 --> 00:20:23.930
in the currencies
that they're already

00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.050
exchanging in gigantic
quantities on a very

00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:29.330
frequent basis.

00:20:29.330 --> 00:20:31.730
JOE HUSTON: Yeah,
it's interesting.

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:36.860
The history of what we
have paid has changed.

00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:38.805
I think when we were
first getting started,

00:20:38.805 --> 00:20:39.680
we were pretty naive.

00:20:39.680 --> 00:20:43.820
And so we were paying about
a percent per transaction,

00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.370
which would be extremely high
for developed world currencies.

00:20:46.370 --> 00:20:49.610
It's a little bit what you'd
expect for the developing world

00:20:49.610 --> 00:20:51.729
currencies we're trading in.

00:20:51.729 --> 00:20:53.270
I think we've gotten
better over time

00:20:53.270 --> 00:20:55.710
at competing different
banks against each other.

00:20:55.710 --> 00:20:58.160
And so we have a US
bank that quotes a rate.

00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:00.650
But we also competed against
certain different local banks.

00:21:00.650 --> 00:21:02.608
And we've added different
local banks over time

00:21:02.608 --> 00:21:05.340
to impart offer
competition there,

00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:09.710
but also to offer credit risk
hedges basically while we're

00:21:09.710 --> 00:21:11.030
holding the cash there.

00:21:11.030 --> 00:21:13.670
And so the total
fees we're paying

00:21:13.670 --> 00:21:16.236
have dropped a ton over time.

00:21:16.236 --> 00:21:20.030
And so now we're only
like a hair above 0%

00:21:20.030 --> 00:21:21.350
or something like that.

00:21:21.350 --> 00:21:24.440
That said, my guess is
the Googles or something

00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:26.562
like that are probably
being a step more clever.

00:21:26.562 --> 00:21:28.520
And so my guess is the
same opportunities still

00:21:28.520 --> 00:21:29.195
probably exist.

00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:35.120
I don't know how the tool
would work, the piggybacking

00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:36.020
off the transfers.

00:21:36.020 --> 00:21:40.110
But I bet there is something
there in terms of, yeah,

00:21:40.110 --> 00:21:42.004
trying to be more clever.

00:21:42.004 --> 00:21:44.420
I think also as we've grown,
we've become a bigger player.

00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:46.787
And in these markets,
it's certainly the day

00:21:46.787 --> 00:21:48.120
we trade or something like that.

00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.760
And so I think
that's helped in us

00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.136
getting better rates versus us
getting first getting started.

00:21:54.136 --> 00:21:54.969
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:21:58.284 --> 00:22:00.450
SPEAKER 1: We can read from
the first Dory question.

00:22:00.450 --> 00:22:02.640
So what are the best
reasons, in your view,

00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.840
to be skeptical about basic
income projects or policies?

00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:10.050
JOE HUSTON: Yeah, I think my
biggest one, especially as it

00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.970
applies to the US
or other places

00:22:11.970 --> 00:22:15.210
where basic income
feels politically far,

00:22:15.210 --> 00:22:19.700
is that a UBI doesn't feel like
a particularly useful North

00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:20.640
Star.

00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:25.050
That there is this sort of sense
of a UBI as this Utopic policy.

00:22:25.050 --> 00:22:28.420
And because of its
elegance or simplicity,

00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:31.160
there's a very good sense of
what it should look like--

00:22:31.160 --> 00:22:32.760
that it should be universal.

00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:35.800
It should be basic, which you
could debate the exact number,

00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:39.860
but it's supposed to
meet the basic needs.

00:22:39.860 --> 00:22:43.140
And so I think almost because
it has this clear template

00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:46.350
for what you should
do, in places where

00:22:46.350 --> 00:22:48.660
that template would
be politically pretty

00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:51.180
hard to implement soon,
it doesn't tell you

00:22:51.180 --> 00:22:54.990
what the incremental policy
should be to get there.

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:58.470
And so in the US, things that
feel more tractable and maybe

00:22:58.470 --> 00:23:01.290
then more exciting are
things like expand the ITC

00:23:01.290 --> 00:23:06.310
or have a child grant
or something like that.

00:23:06.310 --> 00:23:11.555
And I worry a little bit that
the UBI and UBI pilots that,

00:23:11.555 --> 00:23:12.930
including the
directives that are

00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:14.730
sort of testing
the Utopic version

00:23:14.730 --> 00:23:18.480
or the template version,
aren't providing a lot of light

00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.390
on how to get there
or on the pilots that

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:24.150
should happen in the
near-term on policies

00:23:24.150 --> 00:23:26.820
that are more likely in the US.

00:23:26.820 --> 00:23:28.500
I think for a lot
of countries, a UBI

00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.240
could feel closer politically--

00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:32.580
India might be one example--

00:23:32.580 --> 00:23:35.940
for which the conversation
and the pilots focusing

00:23:35.940 --> 00:23:38.920
on that template are
actually pretty useful.

00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:41.640
But in the US, I worry a lot
about the distraction factor--

00:23:41.640 --> 00:23:45.360
that we've cut away
the wonk class who

00:23:45.360 --> 00:23:47.340
care about poverty in
the US and focus them

00:23:47.340 --> 00:23:50.294
on a policy that feels far.

00:23:50.294 --> 00:23:50.960
SPEAKER 1: Yeah.

00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:53.180
And EITC is their earned
income tax credit.

00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:56.240
It's a very large cash
transfer in the US.

00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:58.530
Also note in the comments
of this question,

00:23:58.530 --> 00:24:00.990
there was a lot of
discussion on inflation.

00:24:00.990 --> 00:24:03.140
So there was a study
that was recently

00:24:03.140 --> 00:24:06.087
pursued from the Mexican
cash transfer program.

00:24:06.087 --> 00:24:07.920
I don't know if you
want to talk about that.

00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.865
But it seemed to find that
there was not inflation.

00:24:10.865 --> 00:24:11.555
JOE HUSTON: Yes.

00:24:11.555 --> 00:24:12.930
SPEAKER 1: Or if
you're familiar.

00:24:12.930 --> 00:24:13.888
JOE HUSTON: Yeah, yeah.

00:24:13.888 --> 00:24:18.241
And so Mexico was in that chart
of the different cash transfer

00:24:18.241 --> 00:24:18.740
programs.

00:24:18.740 --> 00:24:21.020
They were one of the
leading innovators

00:24:21.020 --> 00:24:22.820
both in implementing
a cash transfer

00:24:22.820 --> 00:24:25.710
program in the developing world
and in actually testing it.

00:24:25.710 --> 00:24:28.460
And so the US had different
types of cash support

00:24:28.460 --> 00:24:29.060
before then.

00:24:29.060 --> 00:24:31.910
But they were really forward
thinking as a government

00:24:31.910 --> 00:24:33.920
and working with
academics to test

00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:36.204
the effects of cash transfers.

00:24:36.204 --> 00:24:38.120
And so they produced
some of the early results

00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:41.450
on just how cash transfers
work on the individual level.

00:24:41.450 --> 00:24:43.640
But then also a recent
analysis of those programs

00:24:43.640 --> 00:24:46.820
found that you don't see
the kind of doomsday things

00:24:46.820 --> 00:24:49.460
people are worried about
in terms of a basic income

00:24:49.460 --> 00:24:51.890
or in general expanding cash
transfer programs in terms

00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:55.880
of prices just going up
a ton to totally offset

00:24:55.880 --> 00:24:57.500
the value of the cash.

00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.050
That's something that we've seen
in a couple of other studies

00:25:00.050 --> 00:25:02.120
done evaluating that question.

00:25:02.120 --> 00:25:03.950
GiveDirectly's
first study looked

00:25:03.950 --> 00:25:06.200
at a kind of village level
and didn't see any effect

00:25:06.200 --> 00:25:07.400
on prices.

00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.980
A thing we have in works
that we don't have results

00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.880
out is a study specifically
designed to stress test that.

00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:17.060
And so we used our
one time grants

00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:21.200
and randomized the concentration
of GiveDirectly's enrollment

00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:22.490
within a large region.

00:25:22.490 --> 00:25:24.800
And so there were high
concentration areas

00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:26.750
and very low
concentration areas.

00:25:26.750 --> 00:25:29.840
And then as we delivered what
was massive amounts of cash

00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:32.060
in the region,
researchers looked

00:25:32.060 --> 00:25:34.820
at prices in local
markets as well as

00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:39.070
quantity of goods supplied,
local taxes, and school fee

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:41.435
payments, these sorts of
different kind of macro

00:25:41.435 --> 00:25:43.020
or community level effects.

00:25:43.020 --> 00:25:46.350
And so those are results I think
we'll have out early next year

00:25:46.350 --> 00:25:50.450
or so that I hope can contribute
to that debate as well.

00:25:50.450 --> 00:25:53.810
I think on the theory of
it, a lot of the ways people

00:25:53.810 --> 00:25:58.339
talk about inflation, the
Econ model is too simple.

00:25:58.339 --> 00:25:59.880
That they're sort
of holding constant

00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.550
how much can be supplied.

00:26:01.550 --> 00:26:04.020
That a lot of times
either big companies

00:26:04.020 --> 00:26:06.390
can respond to
increases in demand

00:26:06.390 --> 00:26:07.807
by supplying more of the good.

00:26:07.807 --> 00:26:10.140
Or oftentimes in the developing
world, something you see

00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:15.260
is the cash given
increases the supply.

00:26:15.260 --> 00:26:19.410
And so an example could
be you would be worried

00:26:19.410 --> 00:26:21.840
that you gave cash to an area.

00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:24.190
And the area in general
likes consuming fish.

00:26:24.190 --> 00:26:26.076
And so the price
of fish will go up.

00:26:26.076 --> 00:26:27.450
But the piece that
you're missing

00:26:27.450 --> 00:26:29.241
is that often when
people receive the cash,

00:26:29.241 --> 00:26:33.450
they buy boats or fishing nets
or coolers to be middlemen

00:26:33.450 --> 00:26:35.190
between fishermen and markets.

00:26:35.190 --> 00:26:37.950
And so actually this
quantity of supply of fish

00:26:37.950 --> 00:26:39.970
goes up as much or more.

00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:43.380
And so I think the model
people use to answer and think

00:26:43.380 --> 00:26:46.590
about the inflation question
has to not keep supply

00:26:46.590 --> 00:26:48.310
fixed when debating that part.

00:26:54.814 --> 00:26:55.480
AUDIENCE: Hello?

00:26:58.710 --> 00:27:00.590
Can I ask a question?

00:27:00.590 --> 00:27:01.340
AUDIENCE: Yes.

00:27:01.340 --> 00:27:03.230
OK, sorry.

00:27:03.230 --> 00:27:05.930
I would like to learn a little
bit more about your UBI pilot

00:27:05.930 --> 00:27:07.400
in Kenya, you said.

00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:09.830
And I know we have already
talked about UBI a little bit,

00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:13.370
but I guess there's a reason
behind GiveDirectly jumping

00:27:13.370 --> 00:27:16.130
into basic income and
you providing the service

00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.320
to 12,000 people, I think.

00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:20.690
And I'm always
wondering how can you

00:27:20.690 --> 00:27:23.510
get from those results you're
getting from the UBI, which

00:27:23.510 --> 00:27:26.180
is only paid to a fraction
of people in the country,

00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:29.250
then to a more universal aspect
where all people would receive

00:27:29.250 --> 00:27:29.750
it?

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:31.490
And what are you
hoping to learn?

00:27:31.490 --> 00:27:33.920
And do you have any
results as of far?

00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:34.910
JOE HUSTON: Yes.

00:27:34.910 --> 00:27:39.080
And so when GiveDirectly was
seeing the debate on UBI spike

00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.790
up again over the last couple of
years, the thing we saw it was

00:27:43.790 --> 00:27:46.040
was a debate about how a
particular type of cash

00:27:46.040 --> 00:27:47.270
transfer works.

00:27:47.270 --> 00:27:49.460
There is these questions
on the pro side

00:27:49.460 --> 00:27:52.160
that it would enable
different types of risk taking

00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:55.821
or entrepreneurship, help
people live their lives better.

00:27:55.821 --> 00:27:57.320
On the con side,
people were worried

00:27:57.320 --> 00:27:59.630
that people would stop
working or spend it badly

00:27:59.630 --> 00:28:01.650
or things like that.

00:28:01.650 --> 00:28:03.920
And those questions
are testable.

00:28:03.920 --> 00:28:06.470
And so like other
people's launching pilots,

00:28:06.470 --> 00:28:08.570
we saw this was very much
within our sweet spot

00:28:08.570 --> 00:28:10.910
to implement a cash
transfer program

00:28:10.910 --> 00:28:14.330
and then work with researchers
to test the results.

00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.120
The basic structure
we used was to design

00:28:17.120 --> 00:28:20.690
to test what's unique about a
UBI versus other cash transfer

00:28:20.690 --> 00:28:21.650
programs.

00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.720
And so in part to get at your--

00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:26.460
a big piece of a UBI
is that it's universal.

00:28:26.460 --> 00:28:28.850
And so we randomized
at the village level

00:28:28.850 --> 00:28:31.790
with whole villages randomly
assigned to receive cash

00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:33.164
or not.

00:28:33.164 --> 00:28:34.580
And then we also
randomly assigned

00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.820
some villages to receive cash
for 12 years and some villages

00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:39.380
to receive cash for two.

00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:41.472
Because a scaled
up version of a UBI

00:28:41.472 --> 00:28:42.680
would be for your whole life.

00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:46.060
But a lot of the pilots
that have been done

00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:48.194
and that are coming
online are shorter term.

00:28:48.194 --> 00:28:49.610
And so potential
research question

00:28:49.610 --> 00:28:51.590
you might have is
can you extrapolate

00:28:51.590 --> 00:28:55.070
to how the incentives would
actually be for people if they

00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:56.870
had that longer term security?

00:28:56.870 --> 00:29:00.270
Again, on the pro
side and the con side.

00:29:00.270 --> 00:29:04.760
And so that full
study just kicked off

00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:05.960
a couple of weeks ago.

00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:08.940
And so it'll be a little bit
aways before we have results.

00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:10.640
The first end lines
and things like

00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.400
that will be within
the next year or so.

00:29:12.400 --> 00:29:13.820
So it won't be 12 years.

00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:15.470
But it will be a
little bit of time.

00:29:15.470 --> 00:29:19.340
That said, about a year ago,
we started providing payments

00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:21.230
in one kind of pilot village.

00:29:21.230 --> 00:29:23.840
And so it got to sort
of ask people what it's

00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.340
like to receive a basic income.

00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:27.200
And obviously that's
totally anecdotal.

00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:29.260
It shouldn't be confused
with the RCT evidence.

00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:32.310
But even that was
pretty interesting.

00:29:32.310 --> 00:29:35.300
I think if you ask
people what it's

00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.401
like, you see the things that
are consistent with the broader

00:29:38.401 --> 00:29:38.900
evidence.

00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:40.650
People spend it in a
ton of different ways

00:29:40.650 --> 00:29:42.440
because they have
different priorities.

00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:46.130
You saw a lot of spending on
food, especially elderly people

00:29:46.130 --> 00:29:47.420
who couldn't work.

00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:50.430
Different types of investments
in people's job or businesses,

00:29:50.430 --> 00:29:54.410
whether that's buying small
amounts of capital for a shoe

00:29:54.410 --> 00:29:55.640
business I saw.

00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:57.350
People actually
buying fishing nets.

00:29:57.350 --> 00:30:00.620
It's an area right on the
edge of Lake Victoria.

00:30:00.620 --> 00:30:02.190
People investing in school fees.

00:30:02.190 --> 00:30:05.180
Secondary school
isn't free in Kenya.

00:30:05.180 --> 00:30:07.680
Health and things like that.

00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:09.140
Some of the unique things were--

00:30:09.140 --> 00:30:12.800
we were worried on the
operational perspective,

00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:16.361
how people would perceive a
UBI, a few different aspects

00:30:16.361 --> 00:30:16.860
of that.

00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:19.400
One of them is universality.

00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:21.389
Even though the village
we're working in

00:30:21.389 --> 00:30:23.180
and the groups of
villages we're working in

00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:25.670
are in absolute terms
all very, very poor,

00:30:25.670 --> 00:30:28.160
there's still a different decent
amount of income variation

00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:29.390
within those villages.

00:30:29.390 --> 00:30:32.660
And so in this particular
one, the poorest people

00:30:32.660 --> 00:30:34.970
had walls you could
essentially see through.

00:30:34.970 --> 00:30:38.150
And the whole house was made
from organic materials-- mud

00:30:38.150 --> 00:30:39.770
and thatch and things like that.

00:30:39.770 --> 00:30:43.450
And the richest
couple had a tractor.

00:30:43.450 --> 00:30:45.980
And so that's a
remarkable distance

00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:48.590
in wealth and in income
and things like that.

00:30:48.590 --> 00:30:51.380
And so one thing we
asked people was just how

00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:53.870
do you feel that everyone's
getting the same amount of cash

00:30:53.870 --> 00:30:54.650
support?

00:30:54.650 --> 00:30:56.030
Does it seem fair?

00:30:56.030 --> 00:30:58.560
Should GiveDirectly,
as we often do,

00:30:58.560 --> 00:31:02.090
try to pick the poorest
people in this village?

00:31:02.090 --> 00:31:04.132
And people responded
pretty uniformly

00:31:04.132 --> 00:31:06.590
that they were like, we were
glad you didn't try to meddle,

00:31:06.590 --> 00:31:09.690
that you didn't try to
pick who should receive.

00:31:09.690 --> 00:31:12.680
And so was pretty interesting
from a perceived fairness

00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:15.170
perspective about
a UBI and connects

00:31:15.170 --> 00:31:17.960
to some of the debate people
have about the stigmatization

00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:21.680
of receiving benefits
or things like that.

00:31:21.680 --> 00:31:24.290
Another, again, qualitative
thing we asked people about

00:31:24.290 --> 00:31:29.480
was whether individually
targeted payments were OK.

00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:31.730
A kind of potential
benefit of a UBI

00:31:31.730 --> 00:31:33.980
is that it frees
people in relationships

00:31:33.980 --> 00:31:36.530
because each person has their
own individual security.

00:31:36.530 --> 00:31:39.020
And so if a
relationship is abusive

00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.240
or there's a bad power
dynamic, somebody

00:31:41.240 --> 00:31:44.520
could leave or at least be on
a more level playing field.

00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.520
The flip side, if you're
a foreign organization,

00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:47.895
is that it could
look like you're

00:31:47.895 --> 00:31:51.080
trying to break up families by
insisting that each person has

00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.530
their own cell phone and
their own stream of payments.

00:31:53.530 --> 00:31:56.780
And so we were worried that
that would be perceived badly.

00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:59.000
Again, the surprise was
that basically everyone

00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:02.300
said just the opposite, that
individually targeted payments

00:32:02.300 --> 00:32:05.840
let people prioritize whatever
was their top priority

00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:07.950
and made debates easier.

00:32:07.950 --> 00:32:10.665
There was this sense of he has
his money, and I have my money.

00:32:10.665 --> 00:32:12.290
And we get to spend
it on what we want.

00:32:12.290 --> 00:32:14.630
And so there's
not as much of a--

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:17.480
for the UBI payments, a
shared pool that has to be

00:32:17.480 --> 00:32:18.080
fought over.

00:32:18.080 --> 00:32:20.360
And so that was pretty
interesting as well.

00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.594
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:32:21.594 --> 00:32:24.920
SPEAKER 1: And yeah, some of the
negative income tax experiments

00:32:24.920 --> 00:32:27.320
in the 70s seemed
at first to suggest

00:32:27.320 --> 00:32:28.760
that divorce rates went up.

00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:30.960
But subsequent analysis
found that it didn't.

00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:35.960
So it's interesting how this
individually versus family

00:32:35.960 --> 00:32:40.286
orientation isn't everything.

00:32:40.286 --> 00:32:42.160
AUDIENCE: I wanted to
learn a little bit more

00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.920
about the evaluation of
the cash transfer program.

00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:47.710
So firstly, I wanted
to know how long you

00:32:47.710 --> 00:32:50.710
track people for after they've
received the cash payment?

00:32:50.710 --> 00:32:53.590
And then in terms of
logistics and scaling

00:32:53.590 --> 00:32:56.560
up, do you think that the
evaluation model you have right

00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.980
now could be then used
by, say, a USAID or one

00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:03.712
of the other big
donors for evaluating?

00:33:03.712 --> 00:33:04.420
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:06.929
So it varies a lot by study.

00:33:06.929 --> 00:33:08.470
And so different
studies are targeted

00:33:08.470 --> 00:33:11.860
towards different questions,
which require a different time

00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:12.760
horizon.

00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:18.820
The basic template structure
is first, external researchers.

00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:22.720
And so academics at places like
MIT or Harvard who are helping

00:33:22.720 --> 00:33:26.689
design the study with us and
external research surveying

00:33:26.689 --> 00:33:27.230
organization.

00:33:27.230 --> 00:33:29.470
And so it's not
GiveDirectly staff

00:33:29.470 --> 00:33:31.660
asking people about their
consumption patterns.

00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:34.240
It's different people from
a different organization

00:33:34.240 --> 00:33:37.570
who don't have a
relationship with us.

00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:40.090
It's important to
pre-register the study.

00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:42.490
Basically say, we're
going to do this study.

00:33:42.490 --> 00:33:44.521
Provide a pre-analysis
plan, which says,

00:33:44.521 --> 00:33:46.270
we're going to answer
these questions that

00:33:46.270 --> 00:33:49.170
help solve for cherry
picking on the studies,

00:33:49.170 --> 00:33:50.890
as in not holding
back studies that

00:33:50.890 --> 00:33:53.830
have bad results or no results,
as well as cherry picking

00:33:53.830 --> 00:33:56.770
on the analysis, not
redoing the analysis again

00:33:56.770 --> 00:34:00.040
and again until you get
the results you want.

00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:02.050
After that, in terms
of the horizon,

00:34:02.050 --> 00:34:03.760
again, that's
varied a lot for us.

00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:09.010
We have one study that is going
to have something like 18 month

00:34:09.010 --> 00:34:11.270
results out some
early next year.

00:34:11.270 --> 00:34:14.440
But it's sort of queued up to
track people for a decade or so

00:34:14.440 --> 00:34:17.360
in terms of the sample
size and things like that.

00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:20.199
Because GiveDirectly
is younger, our ability

00:34:20.199 --> 00:34:24.370
to have a super long horizon
already done is harder.

00:34:24.370 --> 00:34:28.420
In the existing literature,
the longest follow up

00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:31.030
is a paper in Uganda.

00:34:31.030 --> 00:34:35.290
That was that $400 cash
grant I mentioned to use.

00:34:35.290 --> 00:34:37.330
And that's gone out to,
I think, the eight year

00:34:37.330 --> 00:34:40.125
mark and found
persistent results.

00:34:40.125 --> 00:34:42.250
And there's been a study
in Sri Lanka that went out

00:34:42.250 --> 00:34:43.960
to five years and found--

00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:46.270
it was cash transfers to
small business people--

00:34:46.270 --> 00:34:50.560
and found at the five year mark
markedly different earnings

00:34:50.560 --> 00:34:53.679
even persisting to that level.

00:34:53.679 --> 00:34:57.490
On terms of scale,
in part, the program

00:34:57.490 --> 00:35:00.530
we were doing with USAID is a
good example of large funders

00:35:00.530 --> 00:35:01.905
are still able to
run those types

00:35:01.905 --> 00:35:03.670
of randomized controlled trials.

00:35:03.670 --> 00:35:07.150
In many ways, the big con about
RCTs is that they're expensive.

00:35:07.150 --> 00:35:09.500
You have to have giant samples.

00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.830
You have to be able to fund
things like research costs

00:35:11.830 --> 00:35:12.705
and things like that.

00:35:12.705 --> 00:35:14.590
And so in many
ways, large funders

00:35:14.590 --> 00:35:19.220
are best equipped to
help implement them.

00:35:19.220 --> 00:35:21.020
SPEAKER 1: A quick
follow up on that.

00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:24.330
So it seems like there have
been some long term evaluations.

00:35:24.330 --> 00:35:28.075
Have there been long term
treatments in the same way

00:35:28.075 --> 00:35:29.140
as that?

00:35:29.140 --> 00:35:31.420
I mean, certainly not in
the cash transfer spaces is

00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.180
my understanding.

00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.260
But are you aware of others?

00:35:34.260 --> 00:35:35.010
JOE HUSTON: Right.

00:35:35.010 --> 00:35:37.302
SPEAKER 1: The 12 years
is pretty remarkable.

00:35:37.302 --> 00:35:38.010
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:35:38.010 --> 00:35:40.396
And so I think the examples--

00:35:40.396 --> 00:35:43.180
what I haven't seen as much of
is long term evaluation paired

00:35:43.180 --> 00:35:44.950
with long term treatment.

00:35:44.950 --> 00:35:46.750
The long term
treatments I've seen

00:35:46.750 --> 00:35:48.460
are in places like
Brazil and Mexico

00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.780
that have been targeted towards
families with young children

00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:54.940
and provided conditional
cash transfers to send

00:35:54.940 --> 00:35:57.310
their children to school
and followed families

00:35:57.310 --> 00:35:59.260
for a long period as a
result. And so getting

00:35:59.260 --> 00:36:02.050
into that decade-long
type time period.

00:36:02.050 --> 00:36:05.110
And so I think we have
seen examples of that.

00:36:05.110 --> 00:36:08.420
I haven't seen the,
personally, the evaluation

00:36:08.420 --> 00:36:12.320
paired to check what is it like
to receive cash for 12 years.

00:36:12.320 --> 00:36:15.310
But I do think we have seen
examples of that long term

00:36:15.310 --> 00:36:17.002
treatment.

00:36:17.002 --> 00:36:19.210
SPEAKER 1: I think we had
a question on the [? EPC ?]

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:21.340
real quick.

00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:22.445
Are you still there?

00:36:22.445 --> 00:36:23.070
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:36:23.070 --> 00:36:23.985
I'm still here.

00:36:23.985 --> 00:36:25.110
I'm Krisna.

00:36:25.110 --> 00:36:29.210
I was just wondering
how does GiveDirectly

00:36:29.210 --> 00:36:31.460
compare with basic education?

00:36:31.460 --> 00:36:34.580
The only other
thing that I found

00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:37.500
having extraordinary
effect is basic education.

00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.802
And, of course,
[INAUDIBLE] high school.

00:36:40.802 --> 00:36:42.250
But how does it compare?

00:36:42.250 --> 00:36:44.440
How should I think of
giving to GiveDirectly

00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:47.644
as giving for basic education?

00:36:47.644 --> 00:36:50.070
JOE HUSTON: This is GiveDirectly
versus a basic education.

00:36:50.070 --> 00:36:51.090
Is that right?

00:36:51.090 --> 00:36:52.620
AUDIENCE: Yeah, exactly.

00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.690
Do any education
charities working

00:36:54.690 --> 00:36:57.960
for getting girls in
school or things like that?

00:36:57.960 --> 00:36:59.542
In developing
countries, of course.

00:36:59.542 --> 00:37:00.250
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:37:00.250 --> 00:37:02.910
And so I think the case
for a basic education

00:37:02.910 --> 00:37:05.970
in a country or something
like that is very good.

00:37:05.970 --> 00:37:10.140
And I think it's a good
example of the type of public

00:37:10.140 --> 00:37:12.990
good or public infrastructure
that is hard for cash

00:37:12.990 --> 00:37:14.830
to just replace.

00:37:14.830 --> 00:37:17.010
And so in many ways, I think
they're not competitive

00:37:17.010 --> 00:37:18.670
and, in fact, are
often complementary,

00:37:18.670 --> 00:37:21.810
that a big thing we see people
consume when we give people

00:37:21.810 --> 00:37:25.710
cash are school fees to be
able to go to school or school

00:37:25.710 --> 00:37:28.590
uniforms or school
supplies or solar lights

00:37:28.590 --> 00:37:32.140
to light a home to do
homework and things like that.

00:37:32.140 --> 00:37:36.850
And so I think there's a lot of
complements in this ecosystem.

00:37:36.850 --> 00:37:39.960
That said, it's a
giving opportunity.

00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:42.360
I think, especially
for nonprofits,

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:45.750
it's hard to be helpful
providing a basic education.

00:37:45.750 --> 00:37:47.560
And so I think it's
a hard thing to do.

00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:49.770
And so I don't know of
a lot of really good

00:37:49.770 --> 00:37:54.409
giving opportunities to directly
support basic education,

00:37:54.409 --> 00:37:56.700
even though I think it's a
useful thing for our country

00:37:56.700 --> 00:38:00.270
to provide and it's an important
thing for a country to have.

00:38:00.270 --> 00:38:03.810
It's similar to I think
it's hard for nonprofits

00:38:03.810 --> 00:38:05.610
to build bridges or
to build hospitals.

00:38:05.610 --> 00:38:09.000
That I think that those sorts
of big lasting institutions you

00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.610
want to exist in societies
are hard to provide

00:38:11.610 --> 00:38:12.850
through donated dollars.

00:38:12.850 --> 00:38:16.560
And so as concepts, I
think they're complementary

00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:17.470
and both important.

00:38:17.470 --> 00:38:19.142
And I think as
giving opportunities,

00:38:19.142 --> 00:38:20.850
the case for cash is
a little bit better.

00:38:24.890 --> 00:38:26.559
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:38:26.559 --> 00:38:27.100
AUDIENCE: Hi.

00:38:27.100 --> 00:38:29.070
So I'm curious
how you guys think

00:38:29.070 --> 00:38:30.810
about balancing your portfolio.

00:38:30.810 --> 00:38:33.270
So both geographically,
how do you

00:38:33.270 --> 00:38:35.010
choose the locations
you're going

00:38:35.010 --> 00:38:38.880
to deploy the programs
to, and then how

00:38:38.880 --> 00:38:42.390
do you split between research
programs and just funding

00:38:42.390 --> 00:38:44.701
the programs you already
know work pretty well?

00:38:44.701 --> 00:38:46.950
I guess I'm also especially
interested in the decision

00:38:46.950 --> 00:38:49.584
to start the program
in Houston, which

00:38:49.584 --> 00:38:51.750
seems like an outlier in
terms of how much money you

00:38:51.750 --> 00:38:55.354
gave per person and also
how much that money can buy.

00:38:55.354 --> 00:38:57.270
So yeah, just how do you
think about balancing

00:38:57.270 --> 00:38:59.290
your overall portfolio?

00:38:59.290 --> 00:39:01.730
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:39:01.730 --> 00:39:05.600
And so in general, our
mission is not to--

00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.960
we don't have an expand mission.

00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.200
We don't have the goal of
be in every country on Earth

00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:16.160
or provide every structure
of cash transfer.

00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:17.850
We're pretty
focused-- well, I'll

00:39:17.850 --> 00:39:19.770
talk about this Houston
and Puerto Rico thing.

00:39:19.770 --> 00:39:22.103
But in general, we're pretty
focused within East Africa.

00:39:22.103 --> 00:39:25.730
And each addition of
a country is targeted

00:39:25.730 --> 00:39:27.032
towards a particular goal--

00:39:27.032 --> 00:39:28.490
a research program
that we think is

00:39:28.490 --> 00:39:32.570
especially valuable or
important for policy impact.

00:39:32.570 --> 00:39:34.460
Against that kind
of baseline, the way

00:39:34.460 --> 00:39:37.580
we evaluate new
projects is I think

00:39:37.580 --> 00:39:40.950
a big potential value
of cash transfers

00:39:40.950 --> 00:39:44.250
is the indirect
effects on the sector.

00:39:44.250 --> 00:39:45.960
And there's a few
different sectors,

00:39:45.960 --> 00:39:47.826
whether it's providing
research that's

00:39:47.826 --> 00:39:50.450
especially useful for developing
world governments in designing

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.880
their own cash
transfer programs,

00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:55.580
providing cash transfer
structures that provide

00:39:55.580 --> 00:40:00.180
benchmarks for aid programs
that exist around the world,

00:40:00.180 --> 00:40:02.990
or in general
pushing on the debate

00:40:02.990 --> 00:40:05.900
about how we should help people.

00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:08.900
The Houston and
Puerto Rico examples,

00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:10.910
we debated a lot internally.

00:40:10.910 --> 00:40:13.010
What we saw was
basically an opportunity

00:40:13.010 --> 00:40:17.190
to connect different
conversations.

00:40:17.190 --> 00:40:19.880
A weird thing that happens
in conversations about giving

00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.570
and especially
about cash is they

00:40:21.570 --> 00:40:22.940
can stay pretty disjointed.

00:40:22.940 --> 00:40:25.140
And so the basic
income conversation

00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.110
can happen without
referencing any of the papers

00:40:28.110 --> 00:40:30.540
within the developing world
about a lot of what we already

00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.050
know about how cash
transfers work.

00:40:32.050 --> 00:40:34.110
And so there can be
remarkable ignorance

00:40:34.110 --> 00:40:37.410
about all of the things that
have already been studied.

00:40:37.410 --> 00:40:38.790
We can sort of
throw up our hands

00:40:38.790 --> 00:40:40.656
in Texas about how
do we help people

00:40:40.656 --> 00:40:42.030
without any of
this sort of sense

00:40:42.030 --> 00:40:43.830
of how helpful
cash transfers can

00:40:43.830 --> 00:40:46.060
be in that type of situation.

00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:50.790
And so we sort of saw it as
an opportunity to one, in part

00:40:50.790 --> 00:40:54.670
provide a set of
pipes to deliver cash

00:40:54.670 --> 00:40:58.420
for donors who probably weren't
going to give to East Africa

00:40:58.420 --> 00:40:59.140
otherwise.

00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:01.306
There were people who
specifically wanted to give it

00:41:01.306 --> 00:41:03.020
to Texas or to Puerto Rico.

00:41:03.020 --> 00:41:07.160
And so we could provide
that utility to enable that.

00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:11.770
And then two, provide
the cash alternative

00:41:11.770 --> 00:41:16.390
in a new conversation that we
hope will sort of carry over

00:41:16.390 --> 00:41:18.749
into the broader
conversation in aid

00:41:18.749 --> 00:41:20.540
and in basic income or
something like that.

00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:25.240
And so the bet here, I think,
is that we can sort of connect

00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:27.790
conversations that
are staying disparate

00:41:27.790 --> 00:41:31.297
and that there isn't
otherwise an allocation

00:41:31.297 --> 00:41:32.880
from East Africa to
Texas-- that there

00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.290
are different giving pools.

00:41:35.290 --> 00:41:37.000
And if that's the
case, then it's

00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:38.541
absolutely the case
that there should

00:41:38.541 --> 00:41:41.170
be some type of utility
for people to give to Texas

00:41:41.170 --> 00:41:44.950
and to help those people
better than existing

00:41:44.950 --> 00:41:46.990
opportunities had.

00:41:46.990 --> 00:41:49.532
SPEAKER 1: We'll move
back to the Dory.

00:41:49.532 --> 00:41:50.990
This is a question
I had, actually,

00:41:50.990 --> 00:41:54.890
which was about the savings
compacts that were reported

00:41:54.890 --> 00:41:58.280
in this Fox article on the basic
income experiment where people

00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:01.760
pool up their payments and
give it to a single person

00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:05.120
so that they can engage in more
capital intensive investments

00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.311
or things like that.

00:42:06.311 --> 00:42:08.060
It seems like that
presents an opportunity

00:42:08.060 --> 00:42:11.210
for financial institutions
or other changes.

00:42:11.210 --> 00:42:12.710
So curious to your
thoughts on that.

00:42:12.710 --> 00:42:13.700
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:17.230
And so the quick slightly long
explanation of what this is

00:42:17.230 --> 00:42:19.820
is in this UBI pilot village
where people were receiving

00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:22.370
basic income payments, a
thing people wanted to do

00:42:22.370 --> 00:42:24.290
was purchase big
things, bigger than what

00:42:24.290 --> 00:42:25.790
their monthly check was.

00:42:25.790 --> 00:42:27.650
And so they formed
different types of groups

00:42:27.650 --> 00:42:30.890
within the village and basically
made a ledger of each person

00:42:30.890 --> 00:42:32.450
every month contributes
some portion

00:42:32.450 --> 00:42:34.040
of their basic income payment.

00:42:34.040 --> 00:42:37.132
And one person every month
receives all of those payments.

00:42:37.132 --> 00:42:38.840
And so it's a way to
convert those stream

00:42:38.840 --> 00:42:44.030
payments into semi-recurring
lump sum ones instead.

00:42:44.030 --> 00:42:45.740
In terms of financial
institutions,

00:42:45.740 --> 00:42:48.230
I think people do have access.

00:42:48.230 --> 00:42:49.730
And so I think maybe
the opportunity

00:42:49.730 --> 00:42:51.740
is like a sales one.

00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:55.820
And so M-Pesa is the mobile
money provider in Kenya.

00:42:55.820 --> 00:42:58.190
And it has a ton of
different savings and loan

00:42:58.190 --> 00:43:00.080
products built in.

00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:03.110
You can have basically
a savings account

00:43:03.110 --> 00:43:05.330
on these feature phones,
the same ones that have

00:43:05.330 --> 00:43:06.740
Snake and things like that.

00:43:06.740 --> 00:43:08.300
You can have a savings account.

00:43:08.300 --> 00:43:10.910
You can draw a loan through
your M-Pesa account.

00:43:10.910 --> 00:43:14.090
Recently, they added the ability
to buy government bonds, again,

00:43:14.090 --> 00:43:17.100
through these mobile money
accounts, which is pretty neat.

00:43:17.100 --> 00:43:19.970
And so a question I
have is whether or not

00:43:19.970 --> 00:43:23.450
you'll start to see
a take up of that

00:43:23.450 --> 00:43:26.960
as the need or demand for these
types of services persists.

00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.780
And maybe he'll build comfort.

00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:31.511
And then on the
other side, there's

00:43:31.511 --> 00:43:34.010
a sort of potential for better
outreach and things like that

00:43:34.010 --> 00:43:35.670
from financial institutions.

00:43:35.670 --> 00:43:39.770
There are also small banks
and micro-finance companies

00:43:39.770 --> 00:43:41.900
in Kenya that I could see
potentially moving in.

00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.390
I haven't seen that
happen much yet,

00:43:44.390 --> 00:43:46.406
but I can totally
buy that it could.

00:43:46.406 --> 00:43:47.014
Yep.

00:43:47.014 --> 00:43:48.680
SPEAKER 1: Would you
guys be willing to,

00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.560
I mean, you're sort of
underwriting these things

00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:52.490
at that point.

00:43:52.490 --> 00:43:57.100
Is there a written
guarantee of the stream?

00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:59.762
JOE HUSTON: Right.

00:43:59.762 --> 00:44:00.720
Yeah, it's interesting.

00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:03.020
I don't know how to
turn the GiveDirectly

00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:06.312
promise into something
you could lend off of

00:44:06.312 --> 00:44:07.270
or something like that.

00:44:07.270 --> 00:44:08.480
It's a verbal guarantee.

00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:12.410
But maybe the sort of track
record-- by year three

00:44:12.410 --> 00:44:14.120
or something like
that-- enables that.

00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:15.170
I don't know.

00:44:15.170 --> 00:44:17.295
SPEAKER 1: So I think we're
just about out of time,

00:44:17.295 --> 00:44:20.870
but one last question on
the transfer efficiency

00:44:20.870 --> 00:44:24.340
of the basic income experiment
relative to cash transfers

00:44:24.340 --> 00:44:27.702
and maybe long run
expectations there.

00:44:27.702 --> 00:44:28.410
JOE HUSTON: Yeah.

00:44:28.410 --> 00:44:35.030
And so the different trade offs
for the basic income experiment

00:44:35.030 --> 00:44:38.110
are there are more payments.

00:44:38.110 --> 00:44:41.740
And mobile money providers
have a per payment fee.

00:44:41.740 --> 00:44:44.110
And so there is more payments
per value distributed.

00:44:44.110 --> 00:44:46.850
And so mobile money fees
are a little bit higher.

00:44:46.850 --> 00:44:50.050
We have to have our call center
running longer per recipient

00:44:50.050 --> 00:44:51.980
because people are getting
paid for two years.

00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.040
And so there's higher
follow up costs.

00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.710
That said, the total
value distributed

00:44:56.710 --> 00:45:03.730
is higher per recipient than
our typical $1,000 payments.

00:45:03.730 --> 00:45:06.250
And the way that all nets
is that the two-year arm

00:45:06.250 --> 00:45:07.580
is much less efficient.

00:45:07.580 --> 00:45:10.030
It's something like 75% or 80%.

00:45:10.030 --> 00:45:13.390
The 12-year arm is
much more efficient.

00:45:13.390 --> 00:45:17.200
And the combination of those
two, the weighted average

00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:22.370
across those different arms is
about in that 88%, 90% range.

00:45:22.370 --> 00:45:24.790
The next question on efficiency
was actually [? Harvey, ?]

00:45:24.790 --> 00:45:26.910
which is pretty interesting.

00:45:26.910 --> 00:45:31.007
And so we found the balance
of costs are very different.

00:45:31.007 --> 00:45:33.340
Labor is a lot more expensive
to sign people up for cash

00:45:33.340 --> 00:45:35.100
here than in East Africa.

00:45:35.100 --> 00:45:39.980
But there is zero effects for
us and payments are cheaper.

00:45:39.980 --> 00:45:41.740
We're at the debit
cards are basically

00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:43.650
zero fees for us and
for the recipients.

00:45:43.650 --> 00:45:47.620
And so efficiency at the scale
we'll be able to operate at

00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.697
is a little bit higher
than our typical program.

00:45:49.697 --> 00:45:50.721
SPEAKER 1: Interesting.

00:45:50.721 --> 00:45:51.220
Great.

00:45:51.220 --> 00:45:53.260
Well, thank you so much
for coming to Google.

00:45:53.260 --> 00:45:55.343
JOE HUSTON: Yeah, thank
you so much for having me.

00:45:55.343 --> 00:45:57.810
[APPLAUSE]
