00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:02.073
- [Voiceover] So in the last
video, I introduced this

00:00:02.073 --> 00:00:04.796
multi-variable chain
rule and here I want to

00:00:04.796 --> 00:00:07.863
explain a loose intuition
for why it's true,

00:00:07.863 --> 00:00:10.148
why you would expect
something like this to happen.

00:00:10.148 --> 00:00:12.339
So the way you think about
an expression like this,

00:00:12.339 --> 00:00:14.189
you have this multi-variable function

00:00:14.189 --> 00:00:16.275
f of xy and you're plugging things in,

00:00:16.275 --> 00:00:18.096
but just that function itself, you'll be

00:00:18.096 --> 00:00:21.845
thinking of taking a two dimensional space

00:00:21.845 --> 00:00:24.718
you know here's our xy plane,

00:00:24.718 --> 00:00:28.371
and then mapping it to, you
know, just a real number line

00:00:28.371 --> 00:00:30.400
and I'll think of this
as f, as the output.

00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:34.429
So somehow our whole
function takes things from

00:00:34.429 --> 00:00:37.755
this two dimensional space
and plugs it onto this output.

00:00:37.755 --> 00:00:39.296
T you're thinking of just another

00:00:39.296 --> 00:00:41.129
number line up here, so t, and then

00:00:41.129 --> 00:00:44.023
you've got separate functions here,

00:00:44.023 --> 00:00:46.255
you know x of t and y of t.

00:00:46.255 --> 00:00:47.755
X of t and y of t.

00:00:50.893 --> 00:00:53.828
Each of which take that same value for

00:00:53.828 --> 00:00:55.374
a specific input, you know it's not that

00:00:55.374 --> 00:00:56.556
they're acting on different inputs,

00:00:56.556 --> 00:00:59.076
x of some other input t
and y of some other input,

00:00:59.076 --> 00:01:01.860
it's the same one and then they move that

00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.948
somewhere to this output space

00:01:03.948 --> 00:01:06.448
which itself get's moved over.

00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:09.048
And in this way you're thinking of it

00:01:09.048 --> 00:01:10.714
as just a single variable function

00:01:10.714 --> 00:01:13.026
that goes from t and ultimately outputs f

00:01:13.026 --> 00:01:14.704
it's just that there's
multi-dimensional stuff

00:01:14.704 --> 00:01:16.932
happening in between and now if we start

00:01:16.932 --> 00:01:19.180
thinking about the derivative of it -

00:01:19.180 --> 00:01:21.833
what does that mean, what
does that mean for the

00:01:21.833 --> 00:01:25.172
conception of the picture
that we have going on here?

00:01:25.172 --> 00:01:27.459
Well, that bottom part, that dt

00:01:27.459 --> 00:01:30.394
you're thinking of as a
tiny change to t, right?

00:01:30.394 --> 00:01:32.196
So you're thinking of
it as kind of a nudge,

00:01:32.196 --> 00:01:34.090
I'll draw it as a sizable line here

00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:36.543
for like moving from
some original input over,

00:01:36.543 --> 00:01:38.179
but you might in
principal think of it as a

00:01:38.179 --> 00:01:40.625
very, very tiny nudge in t.

00:01:40.625 --> 00:01:42.831
And over here you'd say
well, that's gonna move

00:01:42.831 --> 00:01:45.959
your intermediary output in the xy plane

00:01:45.959 --> 00:01:48.873
to, you know maybe it'll
move it in some amount,

00:01:48.873 --> 00:01:51.138
again imagine this is a very small nudge,

00:01:51.138 --> 00:01:52.137
I'm going to give it some size here

00:01:52.137 --> 00:01:53.875
just so I can write into it and

00:01:53.875 --> 00:01:55.948
then whatever that nudge
in the output space

00:01:55.948 --> 00:01:57.889
right, it's a nudge in some direction

00:01:57.889 --> 00:02:01.501
that's going to correspond
to some change in f.

00:02:01.501 --> 00:02:05.501
Some change based on the
differential properties

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:09.895
of the multi-variable function itself.

00:02:09.895 --> 00:02:13.583
And if we think about this, this change

00:02:13.583 --> 00:02:16.343
you might break it into components

00:02:16.343 --> 00:02:20.010
and say this shift here
has some kind of dx,

00:02:21.553 --> 00:02:23.279
some kind of shift in the x direction

00:02:23.279 --> 00:02:26.423
and some kind of dy, some
shift in the y direction.

00:02:26.423 --> 00:02:28.906
But you can actually reason
about what these should be

00:02:28.906 --> 00:02:30.349
coz it's not just an arbitrary change in x

00:02:30.349 --> 00:02:31.721
or an arbitrary change in y,

00:02:31.721 --> 00:02:34.975
it's the one that was caused by dt.

00:02:34.975 --> 00:02:38.721
So if I go over here, I might say that dx

00:02:38.721 --> 00:02:42.904
is caused by that dt and the whole meaning

00:02:42.904 --> 00:02:45.131
of the derivative, the whole meaning

00:02:45.131 --> 00:02:47.864
of the single variable derivative

00:02:47.864 --> 00:02:50.614
would be that when we take dx dt,

00:02:51.900 --> 00:02:54.006
this is the factor that
tells us, you know,

00:02:54.006 --> 00:02:56.250
a tiny nudge in t, how
much does that change

00:02:56.250 --> 00:02:58.450
the x component and if you want you could

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.702
think of this as kind of
cancelling out the dts

00:03:00.702 --> 00:03:02.973
and you're just left with
x, but really you're saying

00:03:02.973 --> 00:03:05.313
there's a tiny nudge in
t and that results in a

00:03:05.313 --> 00:03:07.596
change in x and this derivative is what

00:03:07.596 --> 00:03:10.148
tells you the ratio between those sizes.

00:03:10.148 --> 00:03:13.231
And similarly, that change in y here,

00:03:16.538 --> 00:03:19.404
that change in y is gonna be somehow

00:03:19.404 --> 00:03:21.987
proportional to the change in t

00:03:22.884 --> 00:03:24.784
and that proportion is given by the

00:03:24.784 --> 00:03:26.599
derivative of y with respect to t

00:03:26.599 --> 00:03:29.307
that's the whole point of the derivative,

00:03:29.307 --> 00:03:31.930
no no, with respect to t and again

00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:33.489
you can kind of think of it as if

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:34.977
you're cancelling out the ts and

00:03:34.977 --> 00:03:37.126
this is why the fractional writing,

00:03:37.126 --> 00:03:39.553
this Leibniz notation is
actually pretty helpful.

00:03:39.553 --> 00:03:42.313
You know, people will say,
oh mathematicians would

00:03:42.313 --> 00:03:43.928
like, share their heads at the idea of

00:03:43.928 --> 00:03:47.059
treating these like
fractions, but not only is it

00:03:47.059 --> 00:03:49.232
a useful thing to do coz it is a

00:03:49.232 --> 00:03:51.764
helpful mnemonic, it's
reflective of what you're

00:03:51.764 --> 00:03:54.064
gonna do when you make
a very formal argument.

00:03:54.064 --> 00:03:56.118
And I think I'll do that in
one of the following videos,

00:03:56.118 --> 00:03:59.520
I'll describe this in a
very, a much more formal way

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.442
that's a little bit more airtight than the

00:04:01.442 --> 00:04:03.656
kind of hand-waving nudging around.

00:04:03.656 --> 00:04:05.472
But the intuition you
get from just writing

00:04:05.472 --> 00:04:08.241
this is a fraction is
basically the scaffolding

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:09.700
for that formal argument, so it's a

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:12.144
fine thing to do, I don't
think mathematicians

00:04:12.144 --> 00:04:14.254
are shaking their heads every time that a

00:04:14.254 --> 00:04:16.286
student or a teacher does this.

00:04:16.286 --> 00:04:18.286
But anyway, so this is kind of gives you

00:04:18.286 --> 00:04:20.798
what that dx is, what that dy is

00:04:20.798 --> 00:04:22.319
and then over here if you're saying

00:04:22.319 --> 00:04:25.840
how much does that change
the ultimate output of the f?

00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:29.262
You could say, well, your
nudge of size dx over here,

00:04:29.262 --> 00:04:31.926
you're wondering how much
that changes the output of f,

00:04:31.926 --> 00:04:34.347
that's the meaning of the
partial derivative, right.

00:04:34.347 --> 00:04:35.972
If we say we have the partial derivative

00:04:35.972 --> 00:04:38.889
with respect to x, what that means,

00:04:39.782 --> 00:04:42.298
is that if you take a tiny nudge of size x

00:04:42.298 --> 00:04:44.792
this is giving you the ratio between that

00:04:44.792 --> 00:04:48.317
and the ultimate change to
the output that you want.

00:04:48.317 --> 00:04:50.278
You could think of it like this partial x

00:04:50.278 --> 00:04:52.701
is cancelling out with
that dx if you wanted

00:04:52.701 --> 00:04:55.534
or you could just say,
this is a tiny nudge in x,

00:04:55.534 --> 00:04:57.318
this is going to result
in some change in f -

00:04:57.318 --> 00:04:59.206
I'm not sure what - but the meaning of

00:04:59.206 --> 00:05:02.965
the derivative is the
ratio between those two

00:05:02.965 --> 00:05:04.655
and that's what lets you figure it out.

00:05:04.655 --> 00:05:08.414
And similarly, you might
call this the change in f

00:05:08.414 --> 00:05:10.747
caused by x, like, due to x.

00:05:13.137 --> 00:05:16.046
Due to, I should say to dx.

00:05:16.046 --> 00:05:18.470
But that's not the only thing
changing the value of f right?

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.961
That's not the only change happening

00:05:19.961 --> 00:05:23.747
in the input space, you also
have another change in f

00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:26.914
and this one I might say is due to dy.

00:05:30.966 --> 00:05:34.762
Due to that tiny shift in
y and what that's gonna be

00:05:34.762 --> 00:05:36.254
we know it's going to
be proportional to that

00:05:36.254 --> 00:05:40.422
tiny shift in y and the
proportionality constant -

00:05:40.422 --> 00:05:43.638
this is the meaning of
the partial derivative,

00:05:43.638 --> 00:05:46.433
that when you nudge y in some way it

00:05:46.433 --> 00:05:48.582
results in some kind of
nudge in f and the ratio

00:05:48.582 --> 00:05:51.438
between those two is what
the derivative gives.

00:05:51.438 --> 00:05:53.396
So ultimately, if you
put this all together

00:05:53.396 --> 00:05:54.984
what you'd say is there's
two different things

00:05:54.984 --> 00:05:57.255
causing an ultimate change to f.

00:05:57.255 --> 00:05:58.727
So if you put these together, and you

00:05:58.727 --> 00:06:01.363
want to know what the
total change in f is -

00:06:01.363 --> 00:06:02.927
so I might go over here and say

00:06:02.927 --> 00:06:06.923
the total change in f,
one of them is caused

00:06:06.923 --> 00:06:10.778
by partial f, partial x
- and I can multiply it

00:06:10.778 --> 00:06:13.119
by dx here, but really, we know that dx,

00:06:13.119 --> 00:06:16.327
the change there was in turn caused by dt

00:06:16.327 --> 00:06:19.532
so that in turn is caused by the change

00:06:19.532 --> 00:06:22.684
in the x component that was due to dt.

00:06:22.684 --> 00:06:25.184
That was of course of size dt.

00:06:26.051 --> 00:06:27.439
And then for similar
reasons, the other way

00:06:27.439 --> 00:06:30.439
that this changes in the y direction

00:06:32.472 --> 00:06:35.389
is a partial of f with respect to y

00:06:36.274 --> 00:06:38.997
but what caused that initial shift in y,

00:06:38.997 --> 00:06:43.164
you'd say that was a shift
in y that was due to t,

00:06:44.683 --> 00:06:48.158
and that size is dy dt times
dt, you could think of it.

00:06:48.158 --> 00:06:51.192
So slight nudge in t causes a change in y,

00:06:51.192 --> 00:06:53.229
that change in y causes the change in f

00:06:53.229 --> 00:06:55.035
and when you add those two together that's

00:06:55.035 --> 00:06:57.016
everything that's going
on, that's everything

00:06:57.016 --> 00:06:59.398
that influences the ultimate change in f.

00:06:59.398 --> 00:07:00.908
So then if you take this whole expression

00:07:00.908 --> 00:07:03.107
and you divide everything out by dt

00:07:03.107 --> 00:07:06.774
so you know, kind of
erase it from this side

00:07:08.216 --> 00:07:10.992
and put it over here, dt,

00:07:10.992 --> 00:07:12.920
this is your multi-variable chain rule,

00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:15.064
and of course I've just
written the same thing again

00:07:15.064 --> 00:07:17.144
but hopefully this gives
a little bit on intuition

00:07:17.144 --> 00:07:19.275
for how you're composing different nudges

00:07:19.275 --> 00:07:22.565
and why you wanna think about it that way.

00:07:22.565 --> 00:07:23.772
Of course, you can see this, and you see

00:07:23.772 --> 00:07:26.592
the partial f kind of
cancels out with that dx

00:07:26.592 --> 00:07:29.234
and this partial y kind of
cancels out with that dy

00:07:29.234 --> 00:07:31.346
and you're left with
the two different things

00:07:31.346 --> 00:07:32.970
that constitute a change in x,

00:07:32.970 --> 00:07:34.913
you know this one is only
partially the change in f,

00:07:34.913 --> 00:07:36.818
this is also partially the change in f,

00:07:36.818 --> 00:07:39.497
but together they give
the ultimate change in f

00:07:39.497 --> 00:07:41.033
and I think that gives
a very strong reason,

00:07:41.033 --> 00:07:45.200
if you break it down like
that, why this should be true.
