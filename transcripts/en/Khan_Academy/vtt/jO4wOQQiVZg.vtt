00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:05.420
Express d times 4d to the
fourth to the 1/2 power

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:07.120
as a radical expression.

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:09.450
So the key thing
to realize here is

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:14.410
that if I take anything to
the 1/2 power, by definition,

00:00:14.410 --> 00:00:17.520
this is the same thing as
taking the principal root

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.920
of that anything.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.170
So let's just apply that here.

00:00:20.170 --> 00:00:23.570
We have 4d to the fourth
raised to the 1/2 power.

00:00:23.570 --> 00:00:25.000
So this part right
over here-- let

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:26.510
me do it in two
different colors.

00:00:26.510 --> 00:00:28.460
So I have d right over there.

00:00:28.460 --> 00:00:31.910
And then I have 4d to the
fourth raised to the 1/2 power,

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.777
which, by definition, is
the principal root of 4d

00:00:37.777 --> 00:00:38.360
to the fourth.

00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:40.776
And we explore in other videos
why this all works out well

00:00:40.776 --> 00:00:43.100
with exponent properties.

00:00:43.100 --> 00:00:44.950
And we know how to
simplify this right here.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.500
We're looking for
the principal root

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.250
of-- let me write it this way.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.740
This is the same thing as
d times the principal root

00:00:53.740 --> 00:00:58.075
of 4 times the principal
root of d to the fourth.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:06.380
The principal root of 4 is 2.

00:01:06.380 --> 00:01:08.040
And we have that d out front.

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.900
And the principal root
of d to the fourth power

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:14.400
can be viewed as the positive
square root of d to the fourth,

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:16.392
and that is d squared.

00:01:16.392 --> 00:01:18.350
And we don't have to put
an absolute value here

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:21.830
because even if d
is a negative value,

00:01:21.830 --> 00:01:25.540
d squared will still
be a positive value.

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:27.230
If this was a d
squared here, then we

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:30.410
would have to think about the
absolute value right over here.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.400
And then just to simplify this,
we have a d times a 2 times

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:34.670
a d squared.

00:01:34.670 --> 00:01:37.230
That's-- multiply the d's
times each other, same base--

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:38.820
that becomes d to the third.

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.212
So this becomes 2 times
d to the third power.

00:01:44.212 --> 00:01:45.920
Now, another way you
could have done this

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.790
is to just straight use
the exponent properties.

00:01:48.790 --> 00:01:51.880
You could have said that that
is the same thing as d times--

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:56.260
and inside the parentheses, if
you take the product of things

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:58.190
and then raise them
to an exponent, that's

00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:00.010
the same thing as
raising each of them

00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:03.010
individually to the exponent
and then taking the product.

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.410
So that's the same
thing-- so I'm

00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.560
going to rewrite this
part right over here

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:14.170
as 4 to the 1/2 power times d
to the fourth to the 1/2 power.

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.700
And 4 to the 1/2 power,
this is literally just

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.110
the principal square
root of 4, which is 2.

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:23.110
And d to the fourth
to the 1/2 power.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:25.190
This is, again, you can
use an exponent property.

00:02:25.190 --> 00:02:27.910
If I have something
raised to some power

00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:30.000
and then I have it
raised to another power,

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.070
this is the same thing
as that same base raised

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.200
to the product of these powers.

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:37.120
And we prove it in other videos.

00:02:37.120 --> 00:02:39.730
So this right over here, this
expression right over here

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:44.990
is going to be equal to d
to the 4 times 1/2 power.

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:46.960
Well, what's 4 times 1/2?

00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:48.660
Well, that's just 2.

00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:52.880
So this simplifies, once again,
to d times 2 times d squared,

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:56.140
which is 2d to the third power.
