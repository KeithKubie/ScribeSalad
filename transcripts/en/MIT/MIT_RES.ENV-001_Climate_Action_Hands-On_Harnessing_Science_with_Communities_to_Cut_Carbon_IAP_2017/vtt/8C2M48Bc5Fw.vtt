00:00:22.940 --> 00:00:26.090
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
Introductions, Audrey Schulman.

00:00:26.090 --> 00:00:26.990
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Hey.

00:00:26.990 --> 00:00:28.910
NATHAN PHILLIPS: HEET, Home
Energy Efficiency Team.

00:00:28.910 --> 00:00:29.870
I'm Nathan Phillips.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:32.330
I teach at Boston University.

00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:36.440
And the previous
speakers, I think,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:40.010
really talk to how the
environmental problems

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.360
that we have are either
invisible or very hard

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:45.120
to grasp.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:47.330
So being able to see these
things with evidence,

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:51.770
photographs or having
simple and precise metrics

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:56.360
to understand the magnitude
of our climate impacts

00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.030
is important.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:59.900
So this is very much
in line with this.

00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:03.020
And so some of you
here have been with us

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:07.160
from the start, when we met
here a couple of weeks ago.

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:10.440
Some of you came in midstream.

00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.020
So we laid out this problem
about the methane gas leaks

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.090
from the natural gas
pipeline infrastructure

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.000
under Boston, Cambridge,
Somerville, Eastern United

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.650
States.

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.590
Then we talked about solutions.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:28.880
We had a hackathon about a week
and a half ago or a week ago.

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:32.390
And then, yesterday,
Audrey and I,

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.480
and some of the people in
this room, hopped in a van,

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:38.420
and we started sniffing
these gas leaks

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:40.970
and mapping them
on Google Earth.

00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:44.180
And so we just wanted
to share with you--

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.490
how many people were
actually in the van with us?

00:01:46.490 --> 00:01:49.730
So a good chunk of us here.

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.830
So this was us yesterday.

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.019
And this is a combined map
here of both of the trips

00:01:57.019 --> 00:01:57.560
that we took.

00:01:57.560 --> 00:02:02.060
So the first van load, we
had a full van of 12 people,

00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.850
and we drove from here
to Somerville and back.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.110
And then we pretty
much did the same thing

00:02:07.110 --> 00:02:09.710
with a little slight
variation in the second trip.

00:02:09.710 --> 00:02:14.450
So let's see-- so that's
where we are right now,

00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:15.606
is that correct, Audrey?

00:02:15.606 --> 00:02:17.480
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah,
and an important thing

00:02:17.480 --> 00:02:19.390
to know is that there's
a baseline about two

00:02:19.390 --> 00:02:23.285
parts per million in this,
so that the wall, everywhere,

00:02:23.285 --> 00:02:25.035
is just a baseline of
methane that exists.

00:02:28.364 --> 00:02:30.280
That used to be lower--

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.200
NATHAN PHILLIPS: No,
let's share this, please.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.020
But actually please--

00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:36.620
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Sorry?

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.733
AUDIENCE: So it's Mercer
Street, that's the methane leak?

00:02:39.733 --> 00:02:43.290
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah,
so there's a big league

00:02:43.290 --> 00:02:47.100
somewhere here, right in front
of the most iconic part of MIT.

00:02:47.100 --> 00:02:48.420
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:50.170
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Oh
sorry, you want me to?

00:02:50.170 --> 00:02:51.503
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Oh, I'll do it.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:56.920
AUDREY SCHULMAN: But the wall
here that you see of everywhere

00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.110
where we drove?

00:02:58.110 --> 00:03:01.140
That's sort of just the
parts per million of methane

00:03:01.140 --> 00:03:02.670
that's just background noise.

00:03:05.190 --> 00:03:08.085
And the big spikes are
where there were leaks.

00:03:10.950 --> 00:03:17.130
So and what's interesting is,
we did a US survey of Cambridge

00:03:17.130 --> 00:03:21.840
and Somerville two years ago,
and there was a leak here.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:23.910
So there still is.

00:03:23.910 --> 00:03:26.150
It's nice to know.

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:29.650
What do you want to say?

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:33.780
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Well, how
about we go to the area,

00:03:33.780 --> 00:03:35.840
where it was it, Prince
Street in Somerville?

00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.870
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Pearl Street.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:38.120
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Pearl Street.

00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:39.320
Let's take a look at.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.170
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So here's
us going by Kendall.

00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:52.050
And then back--

00:03:54.942 --> 00:03:55.900
I'm having a prankster.

00:03:55.900 --> 00:03:57.733
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Thanks
for driving, Audrey.

00:03:57.733 --> 00:04:00.172
I'm not good at Mac.

00:04:00.172 --> 00:04:01.380
AUDREY SCHULMAN: OK, yeah no.

00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.290
Mac is my language.

00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:10.430
So that's Pearl Street
there, the big mountains.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:11.420
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Now.

00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:13.770
These are all
National Grid, right?

00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:17.160
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah so the
difference between Eversource

00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.279
and National Grid is this
train track right here.

00:04:21.279 --> 00:04:25.320
So this is Eversource down here,
this is National Grid up there.

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.970
And we don't know
what's going on,

00:04:26.970 --> 00:04:30.060
whether there's a
difference in its operating

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:33.420
pressure of the pipes,
or age of the pipes,

00:04:33.420 --> 00:04:36.840
material of the pipes, or
difference in how the two

00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.200
companies deal with leaks.

00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.660
But you know, two years
ago, when we did the survey,

00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:43.890
there were--

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:47.660
you know, this area of National
Grid's was the Swiss Alps

00:04:47.660 --> 00:04:49.710
of Somerville.

00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:51.897
And it seems to
still be that way.

00:04:51.897 --> 00:04:53.980
NATHAN PHILLIPS: So just
a couple of observations.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:57.870
And please, you were there,
so offer your own observations

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:00.240
or questions about
this because this

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:02.030
is a very rich data set there.

00:05:02.030 --> 00:05:04.770
It raises lots of
questions to me.

00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:07.650
So you can see here, there's
actually a couple traces,

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:08.360
right?

00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.960
Here there's two traces.

00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.540
We drove it two
times in two trips.

00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.360
You see that there some
variation each time.

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:18.030
And we talked about
the vagaries of wind,

00:05:18.030 --> 00:05:20.070
and you know, if the
wind's blowing harder

00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:21.600
in one direction
one time, you'll

00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.060
get something
slightly different.

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.030
So is this a leak?

00:05:26.030 --> 00:05:27.690
Is it the same thing as this?

00:05:27.690 --> 00:05:30.030
What do we actually--

00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:33.820
how do we take
continuous data like this

00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:38.640
and objectify it in terms
of, well, there is a leak.

00:05:38.640 --> 00:05:41.520
It's difficult.
It's tricky to do.

00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.800
And you know there
are pipeline leaks.

00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.140
There are holes in pipes.

00:05:46.140 --> 00:05:48.210
And then there
are methane leaks.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:50.370
And they come out of the ground.

00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.380
So even the terminology we use
is not quite fully worked out.

00:05:57.380 --> 00:05:58.260
There's a lot here.

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.730
Some of the things that--

00:06:02.730 --> 00:06:06.660
so in terms of, at one
level, at a very broad level,

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.650
Pearl Street is a mess.

00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:12.450
It's leaking methane
all along that street.

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.270
When we get to
policy, state policy

00:06:15.270 --> 00:06:17.280
makers and the utilities,
and the regulators

00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:20.250
want to know, well, how
many leaks are there?

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:22.912
Because that determines,
like, how many

00:06:22.912 --> 00:06:24.870
crews that are going to
go out, and how they're

00:06:24.870 --> 00:06:26.828
going to schedule, and
how they're going to get

00:06:26.828 --> 00:06:31.200
reimbursed, or repaid for
a fixed number of things

00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:32.280
that they do.

00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:36.540
So this is a complicated
kind of policy science

00:06:36.540 --> 00:06:39.772
type of framework.

00:06:39.772 --> 00:06:41.230
Do you have any
other observations?

00:06:41.230 --> 00:06:42.980
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah,
I want to point out

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.630
one thing in terms of policy.

00:06:45.630 --> 00:06:49.330
This area right
here is where they'd

00:06:49.330 --> 00:06:53.340
taken out the cast iron
main that is quite old

00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:54.690
and put in plastic.

00:06:54.690 --> 00:06:56.567
And we could see--

00:06:56.567 --> 00:06:57.650
I think that that's right.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:58.070
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Franklin,
is that Franklin?

00:06:58.070 --> 00:06:59.861
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah
I'm assuming that is.

00:06:59.861 --> 00:07:01.110
We can go in closer.

00:07:01.110 --> 00:07:03.390
But there was one
part where we saw

00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:05.190
that they've taken
out the old gas main

00:07:05.190 --> 00:07:07.650
and put in a new, better one.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:09.179
And I'm betting it's that area.

00:07:09.179 --> 00:07:10.887
AUDIENCE: So, were
you surprised by this?

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.750
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Not any more.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:24.750
So when we published our first
publication in late 2012,

00:07:24.750 --> 00:07:30.120
early 2013, it basically
made it a problem

00:07:30.120 --> 00:07:35.790
that was well known to the
utilities known to, at least,

00:07:35.790 --> 00:07:40.310
I don't want to say everyone,
but people who saw the paper,

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:43.760
and members of the public that
read some of the press that

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.360
came out about it.

00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:50.930
So that was unexpected
to the utilities.

00:07:50.930 --> 00:07:52.680
And it kind of
knocked them back.

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:55.990
It's like, oh, we have
data that's coming out.

00:07:55.990 --> 00:07:59.210
So they didn't control the data.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:04.920
And so just by virtue of
having data out there,

00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:08.960
it has basically,
kind of say, balanced

00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:14.000
the power a little bit, or a
lot, to get change to happen

00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.136
and policy to be made.

00:08:17.136 --> 00:08:17.890
Is this Franklin?

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:18.930
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Yeah, I don't know.

00:08:18.930 --> 00:08:19.555
I couldn't see.

00:08:19.555 --> 00:08:22.960
I tried to figure it out.

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:24.520
Anybody know
Somerville really well?

00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:26.187
What's the street
parallel to Roland?

00:08:26.187 --> 00:08:28.520
AUDIENCE: Can you assign these
leaks to a specific pipe?

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:42.250
What's the spatial resolution
of assigning a spike to the--?

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.860
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah,
so when we go by here,

00:08:47.860 --> 00:08:51.850
any one of these kind of
discrete spikes, the window

00:08:51.850 --> 00:08:55.120
in which leaks may be
coming out is probably

00:08:55.120 --> 00:08:57.715
on the border of a
few tens of meters.

00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:05.740
And that's dictated both
by the spatial source.

00:09:05.740 --> 00:09:08.090
It may-- even one pipeline
leak, like I said,

00:09:08.090 --> 00:09:10.270
could be coming up
in various locations,

00:09:10.270 --> 00:09:12.350
and then the wind may
be blowing it around.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.170
So that's what this
is allowing us to do.

00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.750
But then streets sometimes have
multiple pipelines running down

00:09:19.750 --> 00:09:20.440
the same street.

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:25.530
Sometimes they only have one
main running down the street.

00:09:25.530 --> 00:09:29.260
So you have to go in a
little more carefully

00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:33.370
and use, basically,
probes that check

00:09:33.370 --> 00:09:36.760
what's coming out of the
ground to actually pinpoint

00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:39.520
the actual pipe and
where it's leaking.

00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:41.890
So this doesn't do this.

00:09:41.890 --> 00:09:45.640
This basically just says,
Pearl Street is a mess,

00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:47.530
and it's got a lot
of leak problems.

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:52.265
And it requires a walking survey
to go back and to be more--

00:09:52.265 --> 00:09:54.640
AUDIENCE: Have you done some
very basic signal processing

00:09:54.640 --> 00:09:55.140
on it?

00:09:57.610 --> 00:10:00.850
So run a low pass
filter just to get rid

00:10:00.850 --> 00:10:03.810
of the small frequencies?

00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:07.390
NATHAN PHILLIPS: No, and I think
that's the type of analysis

00:10:07.390 --> 00:10:10.120
that would be
fabulous to do here.

00:10:10.120 --> 00:10:12.027
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Know
anybody who can help?

00:10:12.027 --> 00:10:13.360
AUDIENCE: I can take it farther.

00:10:18.404 --> 00:10:19.320
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah?

00:10:19.320 --> 00:10:30.190
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE] You
can detect the pattern that

00:10:30.190 --> 00:10:32.004
reflects the leak--

00:10:32.004 --> 00:10:32.920
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:10:32.920 --> 00:10:40.540
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:10:40.540 --> 00:10:42.460
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
So here's one thing

00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:46.020
that I think we all
Audrey and I have

00:10:46.020 --> 00:10:51.280
been trying to make progress on
is, how do you take this data

00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:56.070
and use it to help us start
to quantify how much is coming

00:10:56.070 --> 00:10:56.830
out?

00:10:56.830 --> 00:11:00.050
And that's also a very difficult
thing because, first of all,

00:11:00.050 --> 00:11:02.730
you're looking at this, and it
implies something quantitative,

00:11:02.730 --> 00:11:04.480
but you don't see any
numbers here, right?

00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:08.290
So probably you're wondering,
well, how big are these spikes?

00:11:08.290 --> 00:11:11.260
And actually, you know,
this data just came out,

00:11:11.260 --> 00:11:13.720
so I haven't been
able to process,

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:17.490
but we know that this is
sitting right around 2.0,

00:11:17.490 --> 00:11:21.040
maybe 1.95, I forget
what our baseline is.

00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.154
It's in the KML file.

00:11:22.154 --> 00:11:23.070
We could open that up.

00:11:23.070 --> 00:11:24.010
It's just a text file.

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:27.040
It tells you what we
set the baseline at--

00:11:27.040 --> 00:11:30.100
that baseline can shift
from day to day, by the way.

00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:31.010
What is this value?

00:11:31.010 --> 00:11:32.140
I'll have to find it out.

00:11:32.140 --> 00:11:33.520
It would be great to have--

00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.340
we were talking about something
that some students could

00:11:36.340 --> 00:11:39.614
do is come up with a processor
that just basically plops

00:11:39.614 --> 00:11:40.280
numbers on here.

00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.560
So we could see that.

00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:43.480
What was the concentration?

00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:46.450
If we go, you know, just
for setting the scale,

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.480
I remember, and the
four of us in the van

00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:53.890
for the second round, we
went to Sullivan Square.

00:11:53.890 --> 00:11:56.530
And I think, what was the
top read we got there?

00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:57.519
We were reading it off.

00:11:57.519 --> 00:11:59.310
AUDREY SCHULMAN: It
was like 90, wasn't it?

00:11:59.310 --> 00:12:00.850
Wasn't it something
really ridiculous?

00:12:00.850 --> 00:12:02.308
I've never seen
that number before.

00:12:02.308 --> 00:12:06.250
NATHAN PHILLIPS: I recall
up around 67 or 70 parts

00:12:06.250 --> 00:12:08.270
per million in the air.

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:12.017
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So it's
that spike right there, see?

00:12:12.017 --> 00:12:14.350
NATHAN PHILLIPS: So there's
something really interesting

00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:14.990
about this.

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.720
So we can put numbers on that.

00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:19.030
We have done that,
and it's just,

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:22.150
we haven't had a
chance to do it.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:27.430
But actually this is really
a very interesting issue

00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:29.080
of data display.

00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.510
I'd be interested-- who's
that data person that,

00:12:31.510 --> 00:12:33.964
the display of data--

00:12:33.964 --> 00:12:34.880
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:37.213
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah, I'd
be interested to hear someone

00:12:37.213 --> 00:12:39.340
like that's take because
there was a utility

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.520
person from National Grid
that basically called us out

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:44.480
on this.

00:12:44.480 --> 00:12:46.480
And the point this
person made was,

00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.650
it's like, you're scaring
people by doing this.

00:12:49.650 --> 00:12:52.780
You're taking-- it's an
apples and oranges thing.

00:12:52.780 --> 00:12:55.000
You're putting some data.

00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.690
And all of the houses, and all
of us, are, like, down here,

00:12:58.690 --> 00:13:01.750
and you're creating these
things that are just making it

00:13:01.750 --> 00:13:05.110
look like the world is ending.

00:13:05.110 --> 00:13:08.920
And I kind of get
that, at one level,

00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:13.690
is that this is really apples
to oranges type of thing

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:18.340
because we're conflating PPM
values parts, per million

00:13:18.340 --> 00:13:21.480
with meters, or space.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:23.390
And they are two
different beasts,

00:13:23.390 --> 00:13:25.090
and we're like
putting them together.

00:13:25.090 --> 00:13:26.320
But I will say this.

00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:27.790
As a scientist,
the first thing I

00:13:27.790 --> 00:13:31.780
was trained as a freshman
was, if you have data,

00:13:31.780 --> 00:13:33.850
and you're going
to graph it, use

00:13:33.850 --> 00:13:37.870
the space available to
fit your data, you know,

00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:39.080
and maximize that space.

00:13:39.080 --> 00:13:41.420
So when I want to
plot this, I want

00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.800
to make it visible
as best I can.

00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.969
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]
I think it might

00:13:46.969 --> 00:13:48.552
be useful to come
up with a unit, that

00:13:48.552 --> 00:13:53.870
is understandable as
a measurement unit.

00:13:53.870 --> 00:13:56.100
It could be anything.

00:13:56.100 --> 00:13:58.970
And I will not
mention that word,

00:13:58.970 --> 00:14:03.170
but stuff that
comes out of us as--

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:06.900
I say, you know,
what is the concept?

00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.046
So something that says--

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.460
AUDREY SCHULMAN:
Nathan's idea is

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.770
to sort of take just
sort of some number that

00:14:15.770 --> 00:14:18.440
covers this whole
area for this leak,

00:14:18.440 --> 00:14:21.315
so that it adds up the
whole area underneath that.

00:14:21.315 --> 00:14:22.830
AUDIENCE: So you can bin that.

00:14:22.830 --> 00:14:27.050
But what I'm saying, as
an understandable measure,

00:14:27.050 --> 00:14:32.930
something that says the height
is measured in terms of a unit

00:14:32.930 --> 00:14:38.390
that we all recognize as
a relevant unit for gas.

00:14:38.390 --> 00:14:42.310
[INAUDIBLE]

00:14:42.310 --> 00:14:45.830
AUDIENCE: But you could be able
to reverse model it, right?

00:14:45.830 --> 00:14:47.980
So put it in an
atmospheric model

00:14:47.980 --> 00:14:51.650
and say the concentration at
three feet above the ground

00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:54.030
is X. What's the
leak rate have to be

00:14:54.030 --> 00:14:58.430
to get that concentration
here in this pattern?

00:14:58.430 --> 00:15:00.827
And figure out, how much
they're actually emitting,

00:15:00.827 --> 00:15:03.630
and then you have a number
that is at least in terms

00:15:03.630 --> 00:15:04.977
of their dollars, right?

00:15:04.977 --> 00:15:07.060
AUDREY SCHULMAN: But it's
hard to do that somewhat

00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:08.776
because the wind
will be going by.

00:15:08.776 --> 00:15:10.317
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
Right, but the wind,

00:15:10.317 --> 00:15:12.275
so you do it on a couple
of days, and you have,

00:15:12.275 --> 00:15:15.430
you put in the wind
data to your model.

00:15:15.430 --> 00:15:19.390
And then your model says, this
methane at this first rate,

00:15:19.390 --> 00:15:21.680
it back-calculates--

00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:24.800
from your concentration,
back-calculates an emission

00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:26.850
based on the weather
data as well.

00:15:26.850 --> 00:15:29.675
Normalize that over
multiple days of testing,

00:15:29.675 --> 00:15:32.780
and then you say, this
roughly equates to X emission.

00:15:32.780 --> 00:15:35.600
And there are
research groups that

00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:38.100
are trying to do exactly that.

00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:41.600
So what you have are the
turbulence experts, the people

00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:44.990
that study micro meteorology,
and boundary layers,

00:15:44.990 --> 00:15:46.130
and I'm not that person.

00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:47.465
I know that person.

00:15:47.465 --> 00:15:49.410
AUDREY SCHULMAN: I don't
even know dispersion.

00:15:49.410 --> 00:15:54.070
NATHAN PHILLIPS: But these are
the future areas to take this

00:15:54.070 --> 00:15:55.820
and to try to model.

00:15:55.820 --> 00:15:57.861
AUDIENCE: See, I'm wondering
against whether this

00:15:57.861 --> 00:16:00.110
is a physics problem or
a statistics problem.

00:16:00.110 --> 00:16:01.820
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yes.

00:16:01.820 --> 00:16:04.016
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yes, it is.

00:16:04.016 --> 00:16:06.140
AUDIENCE: Because I feel
like some of these things,

00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:09.020
you could get very
complex physics because

00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:11.710
of the nature of the
scales at which you

00:16:11.710 --> 00:16:16.450
were trying to model this
thing, or run a machine learning

00:16:16.450 --> 00:16:19.050
algorithm against it and see
what is your best predictor.

00:16:19.050 --> 00:16:20.716
NATHAN PHILLIPS: And
I just want to make

00:16:20.716 --> 00:16:23.300
a really quick point
here is, like here's

00:16:23.300 --> 00:16:25.160
one of these spikes, right?

00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.030
This value, let's say
it's 10 PPM, that's

00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:34.490
important on its own because,
for example, air quality is

00:16:34.490 --> 00:16:37.340
related to concentration
of methane in the air.

00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:40.450
It's a precursor to ozone.

00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:44.480
The area under this
curve, we think,

00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:49.490
may be a correlant for
how much is coming out.

00:16:49.490 --> 00:16:51.820
And that becomes
an energy point,

00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:57.180
or an equivalent carbon unit
is this area under the curve.

00:16:57.180 --> 00:16:59.660
But you know, these
need to be validated.

00:16:59.660 --> 00:17:01.640
Everyone in the
class now, I think,

00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:05.599
I sent the email out,
you have the KML file.

00:17:05.599 --> 00:17:07.829
You have this data.

00:17:07.829 --> 00:17:11.609
You have an ASCII data
file, which generated this.

00:17:11.609 --> 00:17:14.819
You'd have to-- the
columns are actually

00:17:14.819 --> 00:17:17.467
pretty easy understand,
for the most part.

00:17:17.467 --> 00:17:18.550
But you are now empowered.

00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:19.633
This is community science.

00:17:19.633 --> 00:17:22.400
And you can explore,
and analyze,

00:17:22.400 --> 00:17:24.180
and run with this data.

00:17:24.180 --> 00:17:27.826
AUDIENCE: I could forward it
to everybody who's signed in.

00:17:27.826 --> 00:17:29.490
Nathan, I have an
unrelated question

00:17:29.490 --> 00:17:29.740
that I'm really curious about.

00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.823
Have you ever driven near
a cow farm, a beef farm?

00:17:36.620 --> 00:17:40.280
NATHAN PHILLIPS: So the one
that sticks out in my mind is

00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.850
driving from San Francisco to
LA on Interstate 5 getting close

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:52.550
to the Southern Mountains, giant
feed lot right next to I-5,

00:17:52.550 --> 00:17:55.730
and very flat baseline,
and then, you know,

00:17:55.730 --> 00:17:58.910
this very sloping increase
as we passed by that feed lot

00:17:58.910 --> 00:18:02.390
to about, I think
it was 2 and 1/2,

00:18:02.390 --> 00:18:06.610
3 parts per million of
methane going from below 2--

00:18:06.610 --> 00:18:09.382
but the thing there,
it's not like this spike

00:18:09.382 --> 00:18:10.340
like we're seeing here.

00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.240
It's just this blob.

00:18:12.240 --> 00:18:13.670
It's a very extended blob.

00:18:13.670 --> 00:18:15.920
AUDIENCE: That's why I think
integration is important.

00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:21.060
So you want to do not just a
spike but a spike times area.

00:18:24.060 --> 00:18:26.580
AUDIENCE: Which an
air dispersion model

00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:30.021
would essentially-- would do.

00:18:30.021 --> 00:18:32.020
AUDREY SCHULMAN: So we're
going to need somebody

00:18:32.020 --> 00:18:33.368
to help us with this.

00:18:33.368 --> 00:18:35.243
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah,
these are great ideas.

00:18:35.243 --> 00:18:35.743
Question?

00:18:35.743 --> 00:18:38.630
AUDIENCE: I just
wanted to know, can you

00:18:38.630 --> 00:18:41.590
get ahold of this device?

00:18:41.590 --> 00:18:43.950
How much does it cost?

00:18:43.950 --> 00:18:46.190
NATHAN PHILLIPS: The Picarro
analyzer that we used--

00:18:46.190 --> 00:18:51.340
and that's now six, seven years
old, that was about $60,000.

00:18:51.340 --> 00:18:54.660
And the manufacturer,
it's kind of like,

00:18:54.660 --> 00:18:55.950
they don't have a price list.

00:18:55.950 --> 00:18:57.510
They're like, call
us and let's talk.

00:18:57.510 --> 00:18:59.010
AUDIENCE: So that's
just for the box

00:18:59.010 --> 00:19:01.714
with the mirrors and the laser.

00:19:01.714 --> 00:19:02.880
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah, yeah.

00:19:02.880 --> 00:19:04.035
So you know, it's not really--

00:19:04.035 --> 00:19:06.451
AUDIENCE: This is the kind of
stuff we have to [INAUDIBLE]

00:19:06.451 --> 00:19:07.380
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah.

00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:10.260
But, what I will say
is that, or maybe

00:19:10.260 --> 00:19:13.785
Audrey wants to talk
about the hand held?

00:19:13.785 --> 00:19:15.802
The Sierra Club HEET thing.

00:19:15.802 --> 00:19:17.760
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah
HEET might, at some point

00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:20.160
have a through Sierra
Club, Massachusetts

00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:24.362
have a handheld device with
which you could check something

00:19:24.362 --> 00:19:26.486
like that combustible gas
indicator for anybody who

00:19:26.486 --> 00:19:28.890
is on the ride yesterday.

00:19:28.890 --> 00:19:32.185
So you'd be able to
check the gas in the soil

00:19:32.185 --> 00:19:37.020
to find out if a tree is being
poisoned by gas-- et cetera.

00:19:37.020 --> 00:19:39.650
NATHAN PHILLIPS: And I can't
forget-- someone, who was it,

00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.540
came up with the idea of
a bike, a bike trailer.

00:19:42.540 --> 00:19:43.290
AUDIENCE: You did.

00:19:43.290 --> 00:19:44.835
That was your idea.

00:19:44.835 --> 00:19:45.710
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Huh?

00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:46.349
AUDIENCE: You were
talking about it.

00:19:46.349 --> 00:19:46.820
That was your idea.

00:19:46.820 --> 00:19:47.080
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Oh.

00:19:47.080 --> 00:19:47.579
Well--

00:19:47.579 --> 00:19:53.300
[LAUGHTER] So that
would be amazing.

00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:55.640
And there's a reason for it.

00:19:55.640 --> 00:19:58.730
Because, as you mentioned,
you know these mains,

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:01.740
they can run, more
times than not,

00:20:01.740 --> 00:20:03.830
they run kind of down
the middle of the street.

00:20:03.830 --> 00:20:05.360
But they can go on sidewalks.

00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:07.240
They can go on angles.

00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:08.890
The service lines leak.

00:20:08.890 --> 00:20:11.285
And so much of what
we've done has not

00:20:11.285 --> 00:20:13.660
been looking at service lines,
the perpendicular, smaller

00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:16.130
pipes that go into the houses.

00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:20.890
So with a bike or a cart, or an
ability to get on sidewalks--

00:20:20.890 --> 00:20:24.680
and to be able to move around
in Boston or Cambridge,

00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:27.397
you know, if you ride a bike,
that's the most efficient way

00:20:27.397 --> 00:20:27.980
to get around.

00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:30.450
I mean, if there's a gridlock,
you're just going around.

00:20:30.450 --> 00:20:30.950
So--

00:20:30.950 --> 00:20:32.180
AUDIENCE: Baby carriages.

00:20:32.180 --> 00:20:34.410
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
Or baby carriages.

00:20:34.410 --> 00:20:39.430
And so Picarro does sell a
smaller unit than that one,

00:20:39.430 --> 00:20:40.520
it's like a backpack unit.

00:20:40.520 --> 00:20:43.225
But it could go in
a Burly trailer,

00:20:43.225 --> 00:20:46.670
or it could go on your back
while you're riding a bike.

00:20:46.670 --> 00:20:47.694
So I would love that.

00:20:47.694 --> 00:20:49.360
It would be the first
one in the nation,

00:20:49.360 --> 00:20:50.920
and I think it would be amazing.

00:20:50.920 --> 00:20:53.520
So if we can crowdsource
that, generate some funds,

00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.515
that would be great.

00:20:54.515 --> 00:20:56.389
AUDIENCE: Well, couldn't
the existing Picarro

00:20:56.389 --> 00:20:59.810
that you had in the van,
can that be mounted,

00:20:59.810 --> 00:21:02.817
that and the battery
or power, could that

00:21:02.817 --> 00:21:05.090
be mounted on our
trailer behind a bike?

00:21:05.090 --> 00:21:06.520
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah, it could.

00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.150
We could actually make
a video with that,

00:21:11.150 --> 00:21:15.590
and that would be like,
let's do it better--

00:21:15.590 --> 00:21:19.000
because what you would use
there is, like a garden cart,

00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.530
with those big
balloon knobby tires

00:21:21.530 --> 00:21:26.244
to provide some
shock absorption.

00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:31.830
AUDIENCE: Yeah,
actually let me make

00:21:31.830 --> 00:21:35.180
a point of some order,
which is now that we--

00:21:35.180 --> 00:21:37.590
I think the formal portion
of your presentation

00:21:37.590 --> 00:21:39.530
is done, right?

00:21:39.530 --> 00:21:40.530
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Right.

00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.030
AUDIENCE: So I think
that we can now

00:21:42.030 --> 00:21:44.107
ask questions of all
the speakers, not just--

00:21:44.107 --> 00:21:45.940
NATHAN PHILLIPS: After
giving Audrey a hand.

00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.820
[APPLAUSE]

00:21:50.820 --> 00:21:52.370
Can we have Susan's
last question?

00:21:52.370 --> 00:21:55.785
AUDIENCE: I just was wondering
because, on the field trip,

00:21:55.785 --> 00:21:58.510
I learned what the symbolism
is by the gas company,

00:21:58.510 --> 00:22:01.000
and what kind of cast iron,
it was written on the sidewalk

00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:01.500
here.

00:22:04.620 --> 00:22:11.550
If the company has the
infrastructure in its archives,

00:22:11.550 --> 00:22:15.250
is there enough
of a relationship

00:22:15.250 --> 00:22:19.130
between the age of the pipe and
the material to know the leak,

00:22:19.130 --> 00:22:22.550
so you could make big
assumptions about, OK,

00:22:22.550 --> 00:22:26.927
if you know that, then you don
even have to do the monitoring.

00:22:26.927 --> 00:22:29.510
AUDREY SCHULMAN: The Department
of Environmental Protection is

00:22:29.510 --> 00:22:32.140
making that exact point,
in terms of basing all

00:22:32.140 --> 00:22:36.650
of the state-wide greenhouse
gas methane emissions based

00:22:36.650 --> 00:22:39.850
on exactly that calibration--
miles of cast iron,

00:22:39.850 --> 00:22:44.710
miles of bare steel, et cetera,
and making an assumption that--

00:22:44.710 --> 00:22:49.270
they know the exact rate of
emissions per mile of cast iron

00:22:49.270 --> 00:22:52.040
main, and that they
don't even have

00:22:52.040 --> 00:22:56.500
to check, either top down,
or bottom up, either.

00:22:56.500 --> 00:23:00.310
And I think that's--

00:23:00.310 --> 00:23:05.350
you could make a
guess at that, but you

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:10.560
have to check to
make sure it's right.

00:23:10.560 --> 00:23:12.810
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah, they
call the emissions factors

00:23:12.810 --> 00:23:14.350
and activity factors.

00:23:14.350 --> 00:23:17.350
And multiply A by B
and get a leak rate.

00:23:17.350 --> 00:23:20.670
And these, I call them fudge
factors, they basically say,

00:23:20.670 --> 00:23:23.860
cast iron has this many
leaks per linear mile.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:25.456
That's your emissions factor.

00:23:25.456 --> 00:23:26.830
Well, how many
miles do you have?

00:23:26.830 --> 00:23:29.551
That's your activity
factor, multiply a by d,

00:23:29.551 --> 00:23:30.550
there is your leak rate.

00:23:30.550 --> 00:23:34.330
But those are
based on very old--

00:23:34.330 --> 00:23:36.835
not just old data,
but very sparse data.

00:23:36.835 --> 00:23:39.960
AUDIENCE: But can you calibrate
that with you leak data?

00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:41.710
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah,
that's we're doing.

00:23:44.191 --> 00:23:45.940
AUDREY SCHULMAN: I
don't think it has much

00:23:45.940 --> 00:23:48.360
to do with each other.

00:23:48.360 --> 00:23:50.870
The Department of Environmental
Protection emissions factors

00:23:50.870 --> 00:23:54.340
make it look like--
the problem is solved!

00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:56.320
And I don't think
that that's true.

00:23:56.320 --> 00:23:59.410
AUDIENCE: There are [INAUDIBLE]
emissions factors, right?

00:23:59.410 --> 00:24:03.790
So they are from the industry,
and they're way outdated.

00:24:03.790 --> 00:24:06.619
Like, this is true, they're
outdated for refineries,

00:24:06.619 --> 00:24:08.910
so when they go out and do
modern testing on refineries

00:24:08.910 --> 00:24:11.022
they see the tanks leak
at much higher rates

00:24:11.022 --> 00:24:12.730
than their emissions
factors account for.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:15.340
NATHAN PHILLIPS: So there's
a really interesting point

00:24:15.340 --> 00:24:17.750
the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts

00:24:17.750 --> 00:24:21.142
apparently has done an enormous
job at cleaning up our methane

00:24:21.142 --> 00:24:23.400
leak problem because,
what they did was,

00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:29.470
the DEP utilized an early set
of emissions factors natural gas

00:24:29.470 --> 00:24:33.940
leakage from the mid
90s, and then one that

00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:38.590
was much lower, from
2015 publication,

00:24:38.590 --> 00:24:42.930
and they linearly interpolated
an emissions factor, so that--

00:24:42.930 --> 00:24:46.437
they hardwired in a
reduction because two studies

00:24:46.437 --> 00:24:48.020
showed two different
emissions factors

00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:49.730
for the same kind of pipe.

00:24:49.730 --> 00:24:52.360
So result you get, it appears
to make it look like we've

00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:55.464
done really, really well.

00:24:55.464 --> 00:24:57.630
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Kind of
like, everything is solved.

00:24:57.630 --> 00:25:00.170
And part of the way they
did they was, they got rid

00:25:00.170 --> 00:25:06.734
of superemitters, or one of the
studies discarded any outliers.

00:25:06.734 --> 00:25:08.400
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
Right, so the emissions

00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:14.280
factors are based on leaks
are distributed like this.

00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.050
But what we know is that leaks
are distributed like that.

00:25:19.050 --> 00:25:21.390
They're long tail with a few--

00:25:21.390 --> 00:25:23.540
AUDIENCE: I mean, I
would say that the normal

00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:30.099
versus long tail is an error
across so many problems

00:25:30.099 --> 00:25:31.206
and industries.

00:25:31.206 --> 00:25:33.167
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yes.

00:25:33.167 --> 00:25:35.500
AUDREY SCHULMAN: And we can
all take a look at this data

00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:36.666
and make a guess as to where

00:25:36.666 --> 00:25:38.940
the long tail problem is.

00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:40.504
It's fairly apparent.

00:25:40.504 --> 00:25:43.345
AUDIENCE: So it's 50% from 7%?

00:25:43.345 --> 00:25:44.720
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
That's what we--

00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.840
Margaret Hendrick did a study--

00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:51.360
that we did together--
that 7 of 100 leaks

00:25:51.360 --> 00:25:55.390
accounted for 50%
of the gas loss.

00:25:55.390 --> 00:25:58.500
AUDIENCE: If you take this
data as kind of the sample,

00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:01.560
and multiply by the number
of rows and pipelines,

00:26:01.560 --> 00:26:04.445
and you try to match
it with entire methane

00:26:04.445 --> 00:26:08.150
inventory of the US, just
to see if the numbers are

00:26:08.150 --> 00:26:09.400
the same orders of magnitude--

00:26:09.400 --> 00:26:10.650
NATHAN PHILLIPS: Yeah, we did.

00:26:10.650 --> 00:26:14.660
Not with the entire US, but
we did it with Massachusetts

00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.300
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]

00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:21.000
NATHAN PHILLIPS:
Yeah, so we found

00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:24.750
that, if we took the chamber
measurements of leaks,

00:26:24.750 --> 00:26:27.120
100 leaks, and we just
kind of multiplied that out

00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:32.060
by the frequency of leaks
that we got previously--

00:26:32.060 --> 00:26:37.540
that amount is consistent
with other estimates,

00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:43.080
and are about one third
of the total methane

00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:47.840
emissions estimated for the
Commonwealth of Massachusetts.

00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:50.240
One third.

00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:55.950
This collaboration, we have to
me, and with Mothers Out Front

00:26:55.950 --> 00:27:01.170
as a kind of hybrid
advocacy science

00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:04.710
nonprofit kind of
coalition, I've

00:27:04.710 --> 00:27:07.470
never been involved
in anything like that,

00:27:07.470 --> 00:27:10.670
and it's just been the most
fulfilling kind of partnership

00:27:10.670 --> 00:27:12.560
for research science and policy.

00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.110
AUDREY SCHULMAN: Yeah.
