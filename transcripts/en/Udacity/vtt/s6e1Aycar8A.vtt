00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:04.120
Of course we don't just see ambiguity
in propositions, we also it in words.

00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:08.530
David, can you think of
ambiguity in a word?

00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:09.810
&gt;&gt; To go back to our throw example,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:14.190
I might say I was wondering why the ball
was getting bigger and then it hit me.

00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:17.990
The word hit is ambiguous because it
could either mean occur or strike.

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:19.990
It occurred to me why the ball
was getting bigger, or

00:00:19.990 --> 00:00:21.050
the ball physically struck me.

00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.310
Take another example.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.920
It's hard to explain
puns to kleptomaniacs

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:27.460
because they always
take things literally.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.450
The humor here is that take could either
mean interpret, as in they always

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.090
interpret things literally, or it could
mean physically pick up and remove.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.450
As in they literally always take things.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:40.970
In fact, many puns derive their
humor from the fact that a word in

00:00:40.970 --> 00:00:43.850
the sentence can play two different
roles in the sentence at once.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:45.180
And the sentence still makes sense.

00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:49.062
&gt;&gt; Did you know that I was going to
say this will be much fun?

00:00:49.062 --> 00:00:53.590
The goal going forward is to look at how
agents will resolve some ambiguities.

00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:57.950
When one correct meaning, and
only one correct meaning is possible.

00:00:57.950 --> 00:01:01.830
Not however, that we might build
our character with a bit of humor.

00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:05.970
Perhaps one form of humor is when
a single sentence can be made to fill

00:01:05.970 --> 00:01:08.033
multiple grammatical simultaneously.
