00:00:00.250 --> 00:00:03.120
Now let's look at the main
web security issues.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:05.530
The browser accepts contents and

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.040
often runs dynamic contents
such as scripts from websites.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.710
The question is,
can a browser trust these contents.

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:17.760
In some cases, the browser can
authenticate the website, but

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.120
in many cases,
authentication is not required.

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.936
But even if a website is authenticated,
the contents that it sends may not

00:00:25.936 --> 00:00:30.910
be trustworthy because the website may
have security vulnerabilities that

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:36.055
allow attackers to inject malicious
contents that get passed to the browser.

00:00:36.055 --> 00:00:38.084
Or the website includes contents or

00:00:38.084 --> 00:00:43.000
links to other websites which may
also have security vulnerabilities.

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:47.836
On the server side a website runs
applications that process requests from

00:00:47.836 --> 00:00:52.828
browsers and often interacts with
back-end servers to produce content for

00:00:52.828 --> 00:00:53.385
users.

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:56.038
These web applications,
like any software,

00:00:56.038 --> 00:00:58.530
may have security vulnerabilities.

00:00:58.530 --> 00:01:02.780
Furthermore, many websites
do not authenticate users.

00:01:02.780 --> 00:01:07.400
That is, attackers are not prevented
from sending requests designed to

00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:11.150
exploit the security vulnerabilities
in these web applications.
