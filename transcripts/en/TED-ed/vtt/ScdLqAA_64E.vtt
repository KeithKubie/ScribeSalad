00:00:06.539 --> 00:00:09.958
Space: it's where things happen.

00:00:09.958 --> 00:00:12.575
Time: it's when things happen.

00:00:12.575 --> 00:00:14.324
We can measure where things are

00:00:14.324 --> 00:00:15.658
and when things take place,

00:00:15.658 --> 00:00:17.157
but in modern physics,

00:00:17.157 --> 00:00:18.993
we realize when and where

00:00:18.993 --> 00:00:22.467
are actually part of the same question.

00:00:22.467 --> 00:00:24.679
Because when it comes to understanding the universe,

00:00:24.679 --> 00:00:28.055
we need to replace three-dimensional space plus time

00:00:28.055 --> 00:00:29.847
with a single concept:

00:00:29.847 --> 00:00:33.644
four-dimensional space-time.

00:00:33.644 --> 00:00:35.773
We'll explore and explain space-time

00:00:35.773 --> 00:00:38.273
in this series of animations.

00:00:38.273 --> 00:00:39.234
Animations?

00:00:39.234 --> 00:00:40.317
Yeah.

00:00:40.317 --> 00:00:42.523
Well, we're not very animated are we?

00:00:42.523 --> 00:00:46.859
Sure we are! Look, I can go from here to here.

00:00:46.859 --> 00:00:48.659
Whoa! How'd you get from here to there?

00:00:48.659 --> 00:00:50.024
How fast did you go?

00:00:50.024 --> 00:00:51.689
Did you run? Walk?

00:00:51.689 --> 00:00:53.357
Did you even go in a straight line?

00:00:53.357 --> 00:00:57.108
Ah! To answer that, you'll need to make our cartoon physics

00:00:57.108 --> 00:00:59.543
look more like physics physics.

00:00:59.543 --> 00:01:02.107
You'll need more panels.

00:01:02.107 --> 00:01:05.301
More panels, please!

00:01:05.301 --> 00:01:10.096
Okay, in each panel, Andrew's in a slightly different place.

00:01:10.096 --> 00:01:11.975
So I can see each one records

00:01:11.975 --> 00:01:14.892
where Andrew is at a different time.

00:01:14.892 --> 00:01:18.981
That's great. But it would be easier to see

00:01:18.981 --> 00:01:20.440
what's going on if we could cut out

00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:22.773
all the hundreds of panels and stack them up

00:01:22.773 --> 00:01:26.069
like a flip book.

00:01:26.069 --> 00:01:28.155
Right, now let's flip through the book

00:01:28.155 --> 00:01:30.607
so that we can see one panel after another

00:01:30.607 --> 00:01:34.358
getting through 24 in every second.

00:01:34.358 --> 00:01:36.439
See! I told you it was an animation.

00:01:36.439 --> 00:01:39.376
Now you can see me walking along.

00:01:39.376 --> 00:01:42.046
Drawing all those panels and putting them into a flip book

00:01:42.046 --> 00:01:45.757
is just one way of recording the way I'm moving.

00:01:45.757 --> 00:01:49.773
It's how animation, or even movies, work.

00:01:49.773 --> 00:01:52.346
As it turns out, at my walking speed,

00:01:52.346 --> 00:01:55.691
it takes two seconds to get past each fence post,

00:01:55.691 --> 00:01:58.521
and they're spaced four meters apart.

00:01:58.521 --> 00:02:00.478
So we can calculate my velocity --

00:02:00.478 --> 00:02:02.482
how fast I'm moving through space - -

00:02:02.482 --> 00:02:05.484
is two meters per second.

00:02:05.484 --> 00:02:08.238
But I could've worked that out from the panels

00:02:08.238 --> 00:02:11.156
without flipping through them.

00:02:11.156 --> 00:02:12.493
From the edge of the flip book,

00:02:12.493 --> 00:02:14.608
you can see all of the copies of the fence posts

00:02:14.608 --> 00:02:16.440
and all of the copies of Andrew

00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:20.124
and he's in a slightly different place in each one.

00:02:20.124 --> 00:02:23.230
Now we can predict everything that will happen to Andrew

00:02:23.230 --> 00:02:26.775
when we flip through 24 pages every second,

00:02:26.775 --> 00:02:28.132
including his speed of motion,

00:02:28.132 --> 00:02:30.343
just by looking.

00:02:30.343 --> 00:02:33.387
No need to flip through at all.

00:02:33.387 --> 00:02:34.638
The edge of this flip book

00:02:34.638 --> 00:02:37.701
is known as a space-time diagram

00:02:37.701 --> 00:02:40.066
of Andrew's journey through, you guessed it,

00:02:40.066 --> 00:02:42.067
space and time.

00:02:42.067 --> 00:02:45.151
We call the line that represents Andrew's journey

00:02:45.151 --> 00:02:47.510
his world line.

00:02:47.510 --> 00:02:49.865
If i jog instead of walking,

00:02:49.865 --> 00:02:54.454
I might be able to get past a fence post every second.

00:02:54.454 --> 00:02:56.037
He's not very athletic.

00:02:56.037 --> 00:02:59.207
Anyway, when we look at this new flip book from the edge,

00:02:59.207 --> 00:03:02.260
we can do the same analysis as before.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.837
The world line for Andrew jogging

00:03:03.837 --> 00:03:05.297
is more tilted over

00:03:05.297 --> 00:03:07.759
than the world line for Andrew walking.

00:03:07.759 --> 00:03:10.926
We can tell he's going twice as fast as before

00:03:10.926 --> 00:03:14.395
without flipping the panels.

00:03:14.395 --> 00:03:16.638
But here's the clever bit.

00:03:16.638 --> 00:03:20.361
In physics, it's always good to view things from other perspectives.

00:03:20.361 --> 00:03:22.226
After all, the laws of physics

00:03:22.226 --> 00:03:23.861
should be the same for everyone

00:03:23.861 --> 00:03:26.277
or no one will obey them.

00:03:26.277 --> 00:03:29.066
So let's rethink our cartoon

00:03:29.066 --> 00:03:31.652
and have the camera follow Andrew jogging along

00:03:31.652 --> 00:03:35.237
as the fence posts approach and pass behind him.

00:03:35.237 --> 00:03:37.777
Still viewing it as a flip book of panels,

00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:39.777
we don't need to redraw anything.

00:03:39.777 --> 00:03:42.832
We simply move all of the cutout frames slightly

00:03:42.832 --> 00:03:45.110
until Andrew's tilted world line

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.003
becomes completely vertical.

00:03:48.003 --> 00:03:50.695
To see why, let's flip it.

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:54.424
Yes, now I'm stationery, just jogging on the spot,

00:03:54.424 --> 00:03:56.051
in the center of the panel.

00:03:56.051 --> 00:03:57.552
On the edge of the flip book,

00:03:57.552 --> 00:04:00.361
my world line was going straight upwards.

00:04:00.361 --> 00:04:03.027
The fence posts are coming past me.

00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:06.312
It's now their world lines that are tilted.

00:04:06.312 --> 00:04:09.438
This rearrangement of the panels is known as a

00:04:09.438 --> 00:04:11.649
Galilean transformation,

00:04:11.649 --> 00:04:16.240
and it lets us analyze physics from someeone else's perspective.

00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.574
In this case, mine.

00:04:18.574 --> 00:04:21.945
After all, it's always good to see things from other points of view,

00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:24.694
especially when the viewers are moving

00:04:24.694 --> 00:04:26.693
at different speeds.

00:04:26.693 --> 00:04:30.529
So long as the speeds aren't too high.

00:04:30.529 --> 00:04:33.278
If you're a cosmic ray moving at the speed of light,

00:04:33.278 --> 00:04:38.028
our flip book of your point of view falls apart.

00:04:38.028 --> 00:04:39.805
To stop that from happening,

00:04:39.805 --> 00:04:42.140
we'll have to glue panels together.

00:04:42.140 --> 00:04:44.612
Instead of a stack of separate panels,

00:04:44.612 --> 00:04:47.977
we'll need a solid block of space-time,

00:04:47.977 --> 00:04:50.694
which we'll come to in the next animation.
