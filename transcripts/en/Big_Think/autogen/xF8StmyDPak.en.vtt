you know one of our fundamental premises

00:00:07.249 --> 00:00:07.259
you know one of our fundamental premises
 

00:00:07.259 --> 00:00:09.110
you know one of our fundamental premises
with human plus machine is really the

00:00:09.110 --> 00:00:09.120
with human plus machine is really the
 

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:11.600
with human plus machine is really the
plus part of human plus machine there's

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:11.610
plus part of human plus machine there's
 

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:12.890
plus part of human plus machine there's
been a lot of this dialogue about

00:00:12.890 --> 00:00:12.900
been a lot of this dialogue about
 

00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:15.650
been a lot of this dialogue about
polarizing extremes of the machines can

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:15.660
polarizing extremes of the machines can
 

00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:17.630
polarizing extremes of the machines can
do certain things and humans can do

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.640
do certain things and humans can do
 

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:19.669
do certain things and humans can do
certain things and as a result we end up

00:00:19.669 --> 00:00:19.679
certain things and as a result we end up
 

00:00:19.679 --> 00:00:21.439

with this you know this this battle kind
 

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:22.700
with this you know this this battle kind
of pitting what the machines will do

00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:22.710
of pitting what the machines will do
 

00:00:22.710 --> 00:00:24.169

into a more machine oriented age we're

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:51.090
into a more machine oriented age we're
 

00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.000
into a more machine oriented age we're
actually moving into an age it's more

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:53.010
actually moving into an age it's more
 

00:00:53.010 --> 00:00:55.370

creates these new types of jobs so we

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:03.060
creates these new types of jobs so we
 

00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:04.249
creates these new types of jobs so we
call that the missing middle because

00:01:04.249 --> 00:01:04.259
call that the missing middle because
 

00:01:04.259 --> 00:01:05.690

about these jobs in the middle where
 

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.709
about these jobs in the middle where
people and machines collaborate and

we've come up with two sets of jobs and
 

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:14.749
we've come up with two sets of jobs and
one on one side you have the jobs where

00:01:14.749 --> 00:01:14.759
one on one side you have the jobs where
 

00:01:14.759 --> 00:01:16.700
one on one side you have the jobs where
people are needed to help machines and

people are needed to help machines and
 

00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:18.230
people are needed to help machines and
that's not a category that too many

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:18.240
that's not a category that too many
 

00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.520
that's not a category that too many
people focus on we think it's an

a minute on the other side we have a set

00:01:23.059 --> 00:01:23.069
a minute on the other side we have a set
 

00:01:23.069 --> 00:01:25.370
a minute on the other side we have a set
of jobs where machines help people

00:01:25.370 --> 00:01:25.380
of jobs where machines help people

machines give people new superpowers and
 

00:01:27.689 --> 00:01:29.630
machines give people new superpowers and
those are the two broad categories of

00:01:29.630 --> 00:01:29.640
those are the two broad categories of
 

00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.879
those are the two broad categories of
jobs we see in the missing middle you

00:01:31.879 --> 00:01:31.889
jobs we see in the missing middle you
 

00:01:31.889 --> 00:01:33.940
jobs we see in the missing middle you
know so that set of jobs where where

00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:33.950
know so that set of jobs where where
 

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:35.840

breast breast tumor conditions with

00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:41.770
breast breast tumor conditions with
 

00:09:41.770 --> 00:09:44.670
breast breast tumor conditions with
about 92% accuracy physicians can do

00:09:44.670 --> 00:09:44.680
about 92% accuracy physicians can do
 

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:47.610
about 92% accuracy physicians can do
that at about 96 percent accuracy if you

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:47.620
that at about 96 percent accuracy if you
 

00:09:47.620 --> 00:09:48.810
that at about 96 percent accuracy if you
put the two together and give a

00:09:48.810 --> 00:09:48.820
put the two together and give a
 

00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.750
put the two together and give a
physician access to the results from the

00:09:51.750 --> 00:09:51.760
physician access to the results from the
 

00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.050
physician access to the results from the
from the algorithm it's 99.5% accurate

00:09:55.050 --> 00:09:55.060
from the algorithm it's 99.5% accurate
 

00:09:55.060 --> 00:09:57.360
from the algorithm it's 99.5% accurate
so it's the combination of the human

00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:57.370
so it's the combination of the human
 

00:09:57.370 --> 00:09:58.560
so it's the combination of the human
plus the Machine gives you the best

00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:58.570
plus the Machine gives you the best
 

00:09:58.570 --> 00:10:00.630
plus the Machine gives you the best
outcome and we find this in profession

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.640
outcome and we find this in profession
 

00:10:00.640 --> 00:10:02.910
