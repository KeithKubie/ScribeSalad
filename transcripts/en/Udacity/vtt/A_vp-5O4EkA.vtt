00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Now, maybe you don't believe me, maybe you don't believe that

00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
special relativity could possibly be for real.

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Clock's disagreeing with each other--what's going on, how do we test it.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Well, as a matter of fact, we're actually testing special relativity right now,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:18.000
and we're doing that with a series of GPS satellites which are constantly in orbit over earth.

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.000
The way these satellites can localized someone's position on earth so precisely involves

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000
precised measurements of distance between each satellite and the observers' GPS device.

00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
This precised distance measurements actually require a precised time measurements,

00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.000
but these satellites are moving relative to the earth, relative to the observer.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
In fact, they're traveling at about 14,000 km/h.

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Can you tell me what Î² is associated with 14,000 km/h--

00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
a.k.a. what fraction of the speed of light is this.

00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Enter your answer in scientific notation.

00:00:52.000 --> 99:59:59.000
I've put the 10 in here for you and you can put the exponent in here and the rest can go right here.
