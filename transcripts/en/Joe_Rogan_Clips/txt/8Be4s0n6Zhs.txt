Speaker 1:          00:00          The general good experience. Yeah,

Speaker 2:          00:03          and the justice system is obviously that's a really interesting thing to talk about and constitutional law is a fascinating thing for people studying this idea that we argue about the second amendment, like let's let constitutional lawyers that think discuss a lot of those things and we should all understand that and be curious about it. But I would think our constitution is also silly. Like let's remake everything. Like let's have that conversation was so much better that we can do have a serious conversation about what kind of guns and bullets people can have. Not that they can have them or that they can't have. Like that's the conversation. That's where we should be. Right now. Everything gets regulated. Everything. There are trade offs and healthcare, there are trade offs and everything, but Americans now are so divided. They want everything that they want. That compromise is something that we don't do as Americans much less in in government. That's, that's preposterous. That the Democrats that demand purity or, or anybody that is doing that, you don't agree with me, you're wrong.

Speaker 1:          01:03          Hold on. That's not not you're related. You don't have any relationships with people in your real life like that. Like my wife and I don't agree on a lot of stuff, but I love her. I adore her. Well, it's what we've talked about before. They're on teams and you want your team to win, so you state why? Why do you want your team to win? It's a natural thing with human beings, right? I agree that what I'm saying about the gun thing, the most fucked up part about the messiness of the gun thing is that even if you made guns illegal, even if you said you can't have any bullets, you'll all go to jail. There's so many guns. You're not getting them all. It's not possible. There's more guns in there are people, which means there's more than 300 and what 30 million guns there are country alone. Absolutely. The most important point in the discussion. That's a nutty number, man. You really stop and think about that number. You're like, what is that real?

Speaker 2:          01:58          But you don't really stop the behavior by necessarily creating certain laws about why someone might behave a certain way and shoot people. That's not going to necessarily change. What you do is you do limit the access to a certain types of weapons and rounds of ammunition. Right?

Speaker 1:          02:14          Yeah. Well the real question is why would someone do that? Right? That's the number one question. [inaudible] let's say the hardest part truck, but it's a harder question to answer. The easier question to answer is make them less accessible. Yes. If you've got people who have problems we can figure out or solve, if you could make them less accessible,

Speaker 2:          02:32          the president or blame, like, I don't mean to get political, but like there's no data on the video game argument that there's no data on it. The on

Speaker 1:          02:40          that. Well, the video game argument is interesting because I've had soldiers bring it up to me, including Dakota Meyer. Yeah, I heard that conversation. I'm willing to have it. I mean I don't, I don't think it necessarily makes sense that people would act out in a certain way that's horrific because of video game. But if they were already inclined to violence, begin with maybe the already had a fucking short circuit and then they get desensitized to violence in movies and violence and video games. Does that have an impact on them? I'm not the guy to answer that question. [inaudible] has an impact on, it's a variable. It's a variable that I think merits discussion. I don't know if it's true or not. I don't think it is because I don't think it merits discussion.

Speaker 2:          03:21          Well, let me make this point and then you decide. If you think of merits discussion. Okay. The V violent video games are played at far higher rates in Japan and they don't have the gun violence. We have. It's a good point. They have a very different culture though. The way they don't have access to guns. That's true. That's it. They don't also have a lot of, they've had a few mass stabbings. It's the access. I, dude, I've shot guns. I shoot guns, I get the, I, I have nothing but respect for hunters. I grew up in a hunting community. Uh, but I mean, I, I don't know. I don't think that there's much past the conversation about access, accessibility to guns that can fire that many rounds that quickly killing that many people. I don't think we have to get rid of those somehow. But I agree.

Speaker 2:          04:08          How do you do it? Your, that's the most important point. There's already 330. There's more guns than there are people. So what do you do? So by the way, I think you buy as many as you can back for sure. You spend a whole bunch of taxpayer money just help. By the way, there's a ton of people in a bind right now that have a rifle of like, Oh my God, I'm not gonna be able to afford my insulin. Let me get rid of this. Uh, AK 47 to live another month. You buy some guns back. It's a good expenditure of money and then melt them down and turn them into furniture for a people.

Speaker 1:          04:35          So if you wanted to do that without changing the second amendment, like you just have a, a buyback where you just offer people the opportunity to make some money by giving their guns up.

Speaker 2:          04:46          Well, the second amendment is been interpreted wrong by the Supreme court in my opinion. I mean it doesn't say that people should have until 2008 it didn't say that. Nobody thought that that people should have a personal right to guns till the Heller case. But so I don't think you even need to talk about the second amendment. I think just people just need to agree that these guns shouldn't be sold at the ammunition to talk about the second amendment. I mean it's, it's a big conversation as people can have guns, you can have guns. The brick has a right to have guns. You just can't have these guns anymore. No more of those ones. You can have all these guns, no restrictions anywhere. Right. And they work city. You can't have a handgun. Yeah, they work. You can't even, I don't think you can have a, a, you can have a switch plate in New York city.

Speaker 2:          05:26          Yeah. Cyrus Vance, the da. There is like terrified that they're changing the federal government's changing the law because he knows that those gun laws in New York work really well. And by the way, people always make the argument, well, they have those gun laws in Chicago and there's a ton of violence. That's because Chicago's on the board of Indiana, doesn't have them. Guns go across the border just fine. That's the gun laws work. They work well. Chicago is also in the middle of of bitter drug war. Well, yeah. I mean that's where the finals is coming from, but we should, people should have less accessibility to those

Speaker 1:          05:58          types of guns, like every other civil society in the world. Come on, this is like, but it goes back to what you were talking about before, like the drugs, if they were legal, you wouldn't have that sort of a drug war. Right? For sure. It's the root of most of the violence in the inner cities and in obviously in Mexico. Yeah, it's the, it's black markets. It's the illicit drug. Yeah. They're making tons of money on that. What is the second amendment exactly as it's written? Can you, the right to bear arms shall not be infringed. So how do you think that the Supreme court misinterpreted that? That in the in the 2008 Alec case, everybody should just a, I would plug the work of Eric Siegel who is well regulated, militia being necessary to the security of a free state comma right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.

Speaker 1:          06:46          Yeah. Those commons get argued by, I know constitutional scholars for a date that the Supreme court didn't decide until 2008 that Americans had a right to have their own weapon. That's such a crazy statement like when you read it, it's so interesting because you were going back in time trying to figure out how people in 1776 thought about guns and whether or not that applies to us because if it doesn't apply to us we have to think about 1789 we, if it doesn't apply to us, we have to think, well then who gets to decide? Like one of the reasons you get to decide as a society on on any of one of the reasons why it's so interesting. I want to believe. One of the reasons why it's so interesting to read these things is like we have, for whatever reason, when things get written written into stone or carved into a, a stone or written onto a document, like the first amendment, like the freedom of expression, we that is that we, we have it.

Speaker 1:          07:43          So we all agree on it. We don't want to change it. Yeah. Freedom of speech, freedom of expression, whatever we want to, we want to hold on to that. We want to keep sure I, this is our humans, the second amendment, the right to have a gun. That's our law. We got it written down. Look, look, look. It's written there. So they'll study these ancient words like scrolls, like to go over these scrolls and look at the commas and look at the words shall not be infringed upon. What did they mean? That's fascinating. It is. It is fascinating. But I think that they didn't mean this. I think that how could they, they did not know what this is. They didn't, and the the, the whole gun thing is a racket to make money. That's what that is. It's, it's a way you sell fear.

Speaker 1:          08:22          Like are you, I mean home invasion is any family's worst fear, but it doesn't happen very much. Nor does kidnapping nor do all lot of these crimes at all. My helicopter, our generation of parents is helicopter parents terrified of everything. Not that's true. That's true. Letting their kids go outside. You're right. Come on thinking that your kid's going to get kidnapped. You don't know anybody. Okay. Who had their kid kidnapped. You are, but you're generalizing because home invasions do happen sometimes, but that's not how we shouldn't make the laws, but we don't have to exist. Like everybody's going to kidnap

Speaker 2:          08:56          your kid or everyone's going to break into your home. But I'm saying those kinds of balance is that sometimes it's real. That's why people want to be able to have guns because sometimes someone can break in your house and people have defended their house and their property with guns. Sure. But it's, it's, is it a way, is it a realistic threat or is it something that the, that the gun industry creates these amazing ads and scares the shit out of people? Oh, come on man. It's crime is real. You know, whether the crime is real crime. Real, real. I think the clear point is, the reason why we have so many guns in America is because there's so much money to be made off of them. I think we could absolutely limit them and regulate them and have a thoughtful conversation. I think that's where most most people are at.

Speaker 2:          09:42          Although I hate that generalization. There's something to that, but there's also something to, the reason why we have so many cars. People like, I'll have that conversation. We should get rid of all the cars. Okay, well, I mean we're not looking me wrong. Why should we get rid of all the cars? Do not like freedom or do you want, you have a better solution? Are you going to, I don't have a better solution, but if they're there, there should to be one or I think that we are killing ourselves with all the cars. The pollution is okay, but you can make them electric then. That's fine. I think that would be fine if they were, I have a Chevy volt since 2012 I have solar panels. I'm trying to be the change I want to see in the world. If I'm coming off as a act, I'm a complete hypocrite and all of it.

Speaker 2:          10:20          I eat meat and I do all kinds of things. I think have a thoughtful conversation about guns and why they're each part of our culture and not another culture. The way that other cultures and countries regulate their weapons, that the problems that they have. Our problem shore, we should talk about mental health, but the problem with that conversation that people don't want to have is everything costs money. That's why you have to pay taxes. Paying taxes is the price of civilization. What does that have to do with mental health? You have to pay for people to help people, right? You can't advocate in government, Republican or Democrat for the, this is what unfortunately Trump and Republicans have advocated, let's get mental health solutions to the violence. Let's do that and everybody's behind that except they cut the Obamacare programs at funded mental health. It's just you can't do, you have to spend the money providing mental health.

Speaker 2:          11:12          It is a problem. It should be addressed, but it's not. The main issue is definitely the guns and the bullets in them. Well, the main issue is the person that's capable of shooting people with the guns and the bullets know it's the guns and the guns and the bullets are inanimate objects. Without a person pulling the trigger. We're talking nonsense here. They're not going to just shoot themselves. The main problem is the main problem is someone willing to grab the gun and shoot people. Right. We agreed. We both agree there's problems with having no idea, but don't you think the main problem is the person who actually shoots me? I think that in every other country in the world, they don't have this problem because they don't have the gun. That's my where I start and end on the argument. Okay. Why? Why is that? They might, they might. That might be the case

Speaker 1:          11:54          that they don't have the guns, but there are places that do have guns and they don't have a lot of mass shootings. Canada's one of them. Right, because they don't know. They don't have the type of guns we have up there. Have a lot of guns.

Speaker 2:          12:03          They do, but they don't have AK 40 sevens with unlimited rounds. They don't have that. That's crazy. If you have more guns, they're awesome. I get it.

Speaker 1:          12:13          Okay. Do you think that more or less limitations to what firearms are allowed to have? I believe they Canada.

Speaker 2:          12:18          I believe that Canada, Canadian gun laws are far stronger, more regulated,

Speaker 1:          12:23          tried. They don't have something. Some, some really, recently Trudeau announced something that was going to severely limit, this is very recent, severely limit the type of firearms you could have, including things that can have multiple rounds and chambers and certain types of guns that are used right now as hunting rifles. Since there was a big push back about that. Let's just read. There's always, there's always going to find that

Speaker 2:          12:48          the conversation about like, like the the freedom, like the, the second amendment to me is it's just your interpretation. Fine. Whatever your interpretation is is fine. That's what's interesting. There's a human insight. It's a healthcare issue and they and they the, it's so extreme. It's really, if you want to know the answer to healthcare is you should talk to public health experts. They have those answers. They have the research, but we'll hold on what research on what? Well, they don't have enough research on. They don't have enough research on gun violence. Unfortunately. I'm talking about if you want to know the solutions for what is impacting and creating a death by any measure. Accidental death. Right, but we're talking about gun violence, right? Healthcare professionals have the solutions to gun violence. I think a lot of healthcare solutions, I think, I think certainly surgeons have argued for why certain ammunition has destroying the inside of the body and unsurvivable.

Speaker 2:          13:39          I think public health officials have argued, certainly pediatricians all argued this idea that you can't ask a parent if they have a gun in the house because the gun lobby is against that cause they're building this conspiracy that the government is going to track your gun. That's terrible. Your pediatrician has to ask you, do you have a pool? Where do you keep the poison? Where are the guns? Cause God forbid you don't, you're not responsible enough or educated enough to know that that kid might accidentally get that gun. And it happens all the time. There's a rule against that. Yeah. Public health officials and doctors and physicians are pretty much on the same case with this issue, these guns and mental health. I think experts too, I don't know, maybe there's a large disagreement and if there is, I'm happy to be wrong about this or any dumb shit. I've said,

Speaker 1:          14:21          well, what you're saying is that these public health officials would be able to make these guns less lethal by banning certain types of ammunition because it's destroying people and checking to see if the parents uh, know if they have a gun or where the gun is or how it's treated, how it's locked up like that they should, I mean, how, how do you feel like public officials, public health officials could have any impact on that? Well,

Speaker 2:          14:45          public health experts are, you know, their entire sponsor ability to keep people safe from sickness and death.

Speaker 1:          14:52          Look, if you have any bullets at all, they're lethal, right? So do you want to have bullets that are less lethal? I think that could be a law for sure. Why not us lethal? Yeah. Take two human bodies. Yeah. We shouldn't be killing each other with bullets all the time. A bullet, I'll stop anybody a blunt or whatever it is. I don't understand the arguments about ammunition, but the point about Poe, but you brought it up. That's why I brought it up. Fine. Public health experts will look at what is creating sickness and death car accidents. What I'm saying to you is that I think it's disingenuous to say that public health officials have an answer to why we're having so much mass violence. I don't think anybody has an answer. I think we're terrified. And I think we could say it's, if they didn't have guns, he wouldn't be able to do it.

Speaker 1:          15:34          And you're right. And I can say if we, these people weren't mentally handicapped or filled with, I shouldn't say handicapped melted me mentally compromised, uh, filled with all kinds of demons, all sense of demons, the different medications that are fucking with their judgment, uh, abuse, all sorts of, of they spirits and childhood. There's a lot of factors. Sure. No one, no one has any idea why someone who is abused and who's fucked up is capable of making that leap. We have some thoughts on it. That's all. We have some thoughts on it and we talk about it endlessly. And you're right, if no one had a gun, there would be no issue with that. You wouldn't be able to mass shoot people. But would we still have fucked up people that are lashing out trying to hurt people. I think we always will, but we have mental health.

Speaker 1:          16:18          We have to fund. No one's already searched. Yeah. A lot of people are, well, I'm not. I think you should. I think we should, not only should we comp [inaudible] mental health, we, it should be a top priority. I think we should think about having four hour work days being mandatory. I think we should help people. I think you, you know, they just did an experiment Microsoft did in Japan in fact, and they found that a four hour or a four day work week rather increase productivity by 40% yeah. I think a lot of people, I don't know, maybe this is their culture or maybe it was, this is a specific instance, the type of people that would get a job at Microsoft, but you know what? What you're dealing with for most people is beaten down shells that are tired of high. All that together.

Speaker 1:          17:01          Go back to the gun argument. Argue for the four hour work week in any other type of benefits that civilized nations around the world, especially in Scandinavia, have study in that culture is really interesting and what they do and, and you realize that there's any number of things that you can do to help people and how do you, you have to be able to fund those solutions and people don't want to do it, right? People don't want to pay more taxes, but they also have a distrust in the way the government spends their money. So it becomes a catch 22 even if they wanted things to be better, they don't trust the government to spend their money. Like if you work hard and you make X amount of dollars and the government argument, but there's not a bet necessarily a better way, fine, I give you that argument, but there we have to come together as society and gray. This is how we're going to spend money on a fire department, on schools and so on. Well, no one's arguing

Speaker 3:          17:57          [inaudible].
