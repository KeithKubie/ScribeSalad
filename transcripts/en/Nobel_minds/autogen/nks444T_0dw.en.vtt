whether you're right or not then of
 

00:04:09.709 --> 00:04:10.929
whether you're right or not then of
course you better think it through very

course you better think it through very
 

00:04:10.939 --> 00:04:13.780
course you better think it through very
carefully but if you feel you're right

00:04:13.780 --> 00:04:13.790
carefully but if you feel you're right
 

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:15.999
carefully but if you feel you're right
then you should muster your arguments

00:04:15.999 --> 00:04:16.009
then you should muster your arguments
 

00:04:16.009 --> 00:04:19.900
then you should muster your arguments
and absolutely finally even with the
