00:00:00.280 --> 00:00:03.810
Everytime I drink something with aspartame
in it, I can't help but worry to myself: AM

00:00:03.810 --> 00:00:06.660
I DRINKING CANCER?

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:13.110
Hey everyone, Laci Green here for DNews.

00:00:13.110 --> 00:00:16.860
Artificial sweeteners have been a hotbed of
scientific debate for decades.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:19.850
There's so much to be said about it -- but
here's a quick roundup of a few things you

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.600
should know about the most common artificial
sweeteners.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:28.070
Saccharin AKA Sweet n Low was the first artificial
sweetener discovered waaay back in 1879 while

00:00:28.070 --> 00:00:31.010
scientists were formulating chemical dyes
from coal tar.

00:00:31.010 --> 00:00:32.210
I know: YUM!

00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:35.949
In the 70s, studies came out finding that
saccharin caused bladder cancer in rats - and

00:00:35.949 --> 00:00:38.600
so the government required a cancer warning
on the label.

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:42.579
They tried to take it off the market, but
the diet industry was making big bucks and

00:00:42.579 --> 00:00:44.170
weren't gonna have any of that.

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:47.899
Fast forward to the 90s and studies begin
to suggest that the bladder cancer effect

00:00:47.899 --> 00:00:52.479
is ONLY in rodents, not humans, and by 2000,
the warning label was removed.

00:00:52.479 --> 00:00:56.870
However, the Center for Science in the Public
Interest, which is a non-profit watchdog group,

00:00:56.870 --> 00:00:58.239
has saccharin on their "avoid" list.

00:00:58.239 --> 00:01:01.739
Saccharin has lost a lot of its popularity
because of the controversy.

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:05.269
The most common artificial sweetener on the
market today is sucralose AKA Splenda.

00:01:05.269 --> 00:01:09.460
There's a lot of talk about how Splenda is
unsafe and hasn't been tested...but since

00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:14.799
its discovery in 1976, it has been the subject
of over 100 long and short-term animal and

00:01:14.799 --> 00:01:15.799
human studies.

00:01:15.799 --> 00:01:19.369
And except for a couple highly questioned
studies, no ill effects have been found, so

00:01:19.369 --> 00:01:22.079
long as you aren't eating a tub of sucralose
for dinner.

00:01:22.079 --> 00:01:27.369
The FDA approved it in 1998 and the CSPI also
agrees it's a safe, non-carcinogenic alternative

00:01:27.369 --> 00:01:28.369
to sugar.

00:01:28.369 --> 00:01:30.969
Lastly, the biggie: aspartame.

00:01:30.969 --> 00:01:35.009
It's found in sooo many products these days,
from to drinks, to candy, gum, jam, processed

00:01:35.009 --> 00:01:36.789
foods.

00:01:36.789 --> 00:01:40.450
Aspartame came about in the 60's when scientists
were looking for ulcer treatments.

00:01:40.450 --> 00:01:41.990
It's been widely studied since then.

00:01:41.990 --> 00:01:45.701
The main things you should know is that the
cancer concerns come mostly from a set of

00:01:45.701 --> 00:01:49.969
high profile studies done in Italy where they
fed extremely high amounts of aspartame to

00:01:49.969 --> 00:01:51.149
rats throughout their lifespan.

00:01:51.149 --> 00:01:55.109
The rats developed blood and breast cancers
as well as kidney tumors, which are extremely

00:01:55.109 --> 00:01:56.960
rare in the breed of rat used.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:01.340
However, the FDA and the EFSA both rejected
the studies on the (rather vague) grounds

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.900
that they "lacked important data" and approved
Aspartame anyway.

00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:05.929
As for studies on people?

00:02:05.929 --> 00:02:10.070
The largest study was done by the National
Cancer Institute examining cancer rates in

00:02:10.070 --> 00:02:11.120
a half million adults.

00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.569
Between groups that did and did not consume
products with aspartame, there was no increased

00:02:15.569 --> 00:02:17.379
risk of cancer for those that did.

00:02:17.379 --> 00:02:21.349
The watchdog group argues that this study
was incomplete: it didn't include the very

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:25.620
elderly, nor people who had consumed aspartame
since childhood.

00:02:25.620 --> 00:02:28.840
Aspartame intake was also self reported - which
is a serious flaw when you consider the fact

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:31.170
that a lot of the time people don't know it's
in their food.

00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.840
The CSPI gives aspartame it's lowest food
safety ranking and argues that it is not safe

00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:36.840
for human consumption.

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:39.990
I've read lots of reports out of concern for
my own health, and you should too if you're

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.990
interested!

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:44.790
The bottom line seems to be: sucralose is
the safest for regular consumption.

00:02:44.790 --> 00:02:47.769
Aspartame and saccharin are more questionable,
so if you're going to consume them, maybe

00:02:47.769 --> 00:02:48.920
don't have too much.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:52.769
Also: if you're using artificial sweeteners
to lose weight, there's a STRONG body of research

00:02:52.769 --> 00:02:54.520
that suggests it doesn't help.

00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:58.560
In fact, across several large studies done
at Yale for the National Institute of Health:

00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:01.780
people who use artificial sweeteners actually
gain weight over time.

00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:03.840
They're still trying to figure out why this
happens.

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:07.910
Scientists are also just starting to study
a relatively new artificial sweetener touted

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:11.360
as a "natural alternative to sugar" called
Stevia, or Truvia.

00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:14.920
With the limited studies that are out there,
it looks like it could be safe, and the CSPI

00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:18.080
statements seem more positive about the potential
for Stevia.

00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.439
OH MAN.

00:03:19.439 --> 00:03:20.439
Lotsa facts today!

00:03:20.439 --> 00:03:21.970
Hope this was useful to some of you out there.

00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:24.450
I'm gonna put lots of further reading in the
description, check it out, and let me know

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.189
what you think about artificial sweeteners

00:03:27.189 --> 00:03:28.870
Thanks for joining me, I'll see you next time!
