TIMOTHY JORDAN: Hi, I'm Timothy.

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:06.650
RAN NACHMANY: Hi, I'm Ran.

00:00:06.650 --> 00:00:08.430
TIMOTHY JORDAN: And you're
here with "The Developer

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.520
Show" on location at the
Launchpad Accelerator.

00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:18.220
[MUSIC PLAYING]

00:00:18.220 --> 00:00:19.446
Tell me, what is Launchpad?

00:00:19.446 --> 00:00:21.070
RAN NACHMANY: In
Launchpad Accelerator,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.990
we work with late stage setups.

00:00:22.990 --> 00:00:25.160
And their biggest
challenge is how to grow.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.770
Turns out, in order to
build a successful business,

00:00:27.770 --> 00:00:30.910
it's more than just writing
great lines of code.

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.290
You need to work on
marketing, on user experience,

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:35.820
on your product strategy,
how you raise funds,

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:37.290
and how you build your company.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.050
We have startups here from
Indonesia, India, Brazil,

00:00:40.050 --> 00:00:41.110
and Mexico.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:42.510
They go back home
and we continue

00:00:42.510 --> 00:00:44.674
to work with them for
a period of six months.

00:00:44.674 --> 00:00:45.965
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's amazing.

00:00:45.965 --> 00:00:47.135
RAN NACHMANY: I hope so.

00:00:47.135 --> 00:00:48.905
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So
we're going to talk

00:00:48.905 --> 00:00:51.030
with a few startups today,
and a few of the mentors

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:53.982
about their experience with
the Launchpad Accelerator

00:00:53.982 --> 00:00:55.440
and some of the
Google technologies

00:00:55.440 --> 00:00:56.070
that they're using.

00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:57.510
RAN NACHMANY: Great,
sounds awesome.

00:00:57.510 --> 00:00:58.843
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Let's get to it.

00:01:04.489 --> 00:01:07.370
So I'm now standing here
with Iman and Jordan.

00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:11.330
Iman is CEO of a startup that's
at the Launchpad Accelerator,

00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:12.935
and Jordan was his mentor.

00:01:12.935 --> 00:01:14.870
Iman, tell us a little
bit about your startup.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:16.350
IMAN: We are Ruangguru.

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.894
In English, it means
[? classroom. ?]

00:01:17.894 --> 00:01:20.310
So what we're doing is that
we built a learning management

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:23.040
system targeting to K-12
market in Indonesia.

00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:25.692
And on the other hand, we also
provide a tool for teachers

00:01:25.692 --> 00:01:28.025
and also parents to monitor
how students are performing.

00:01:28.025 --> 00:01:29.316
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's awesome.

00:01:29.316 --> 00:01:31.790
Now what Google
technologies do you use?

00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:33.859
IMAN: One of the things
that we are working on

00:01:33.859 --> 00:01:35.400
while we are at
Launchpad is actually

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.564
to build a progressive web app.

00:01:37.564 --> 00:01:39.230
Because one of things
that we figure out

00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:42.700
working in Indonesian market is
that the internet penetration

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:44.530
is very low there.

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.170
And the data also
costs very highly.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:49.920
So that's also one of the
concerns that most of our users

00:01:49.920 --> 00:01:50.420
have.

00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:52.130
So we're thinking
about the solution

00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:56.610
to actually equip our users to
increase speed and conversion,

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:57.110
definitely.

00:01:57.110 --> 00:01:58.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's amazing.

00:01:58.390 --> 00:01:59.590
And Jordan's been helping you?

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:00.420
IMAN: Yeah, definitely.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:01.285
It's been really helpful.

00:02:01.285 --> 00:02:02.460
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Now,
how's the process been

00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:04.751
going, adding in progressive
web apps to this business?

00:02:04.751 --> 00:02:07.739
JORDAN: I mean, Ruangguru has
a very straightforward business

00:02:07.739 --> 00:02:10.030
in network conditions like
Indonesia, where there's not

00:02:10.030 --> 00:02:11.540
always a great
network connection,

00:02:11.540 --> 00:02:13.400
where sometimes you
think you're on Wi-Fi,

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.150
sometimes you're on 2G,
sometimes you're on 3G.

00:02:15.150 --> 00:02:16.400
But really, you're on nothing.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.670
It happens a lot.

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:20.452
And what it allows you
to do is as an app,

00:02:20.452 --> 00:02:22.160
you can pull from the
cache on the device

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:24.035
first before having to
go out to the network.

00:02:24.035 --> 00:02:25.750
So Ruangguru can
use service workers,

00:02:25.750 --> 00:02:28.500
use caching to create a kind
of offline first application

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.769
for their web app that enables
students to read content

00:02:31.769 --> 00:02:34.060
at home where they might not
have a network connection,

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.601
or on the train
where there might not

00:02:35.601 --> 00:02:36.979
be any cellular service at all.

00:02:36.979 --> 00:02:38.270
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's amazing.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:39.730
Iman, thanks so
much for joining us.

00:02:39.730 --> 00:02:40.610
IMAN: Yeah, my pleasure.

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:41.750
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Jordan,
you want to stick around

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:42.400
for another one?

00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:42.970
JORDAN: For sure.

00:02:42.970 --> 00:02:44.053
TIMOTHY JORDAN: All right.

00:02:49.238 --> 00:02:51.020
Anshoo, thank you
for joining us.

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:51.530
ANSHOO: Thank you so much.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.550
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Will
you tell us a little bit

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:54.270
about your startup, Magicpin?

00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:55.920
ANSHOO: So So the
name Magicpin comes

00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:57.780
from pinning a
location on the map,

00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.182
and we'll show you the
magic around that location.

00:03:00.182 --> 00:03:01.390
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's great.

00:03:01.390 --> 00:03:04.010
ANSHOO: We are a
hyperlocal social network,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.440
where for our users,
we get them to discover

00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:09.010
interesting people around
them, interesting merchants

00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:09.740
around them.

00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:12.830
And from merchants, we let
them tap that local audience,

00:03:12.830 --> 00:03:15.160
which is otherwise very hard
for them to reach out to.

00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:17.620
So they can increase
new customers

00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:20.669
for themselves, increase
revenue when they are in trust,

00:03:20.669 --> 00:03:22.960
and then also just generally
connect with the users who

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.100
live in that locality.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:24.790
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Very cool.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:26.248
And you've been
working with Jordan

00:03:26.248 --> 00:03:29.080
on creating a
progressive web app.

00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:31.420
ANSHOO: And the sessions
have been great,

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:34.690
because in a market like
India, downloading an app

00:03:34.690 --> 00:03:36.890
is also a higher commitment.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:39.110
It requires-- on
an average, a user

00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:41.030
would keep five or six
apps on their phone.

00:03:41.030 --> 00:03:43.350
And if you want to be
the next job to download,

00:03:43.350 --> 00:03:44.850
then that is a high
[? attrition. ?]

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.141
There is more friction to that.

00:03:46.141 --> 00:03:47.830
What progressive
web apps let us do--

00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:49.540
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Five or six apps?

00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:52.000
Five or six?

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.740
I download five
or six apps a day.

00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:56.600
JORDAN: And a lot of the
devices in these markets

00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.470
have not that much
space on device.

00:03:58.470 --> 00:04:00.490
So you're talking about
128 megabytes of memory,

00:04:00.490 --> 00:04:01.990
and when you add
in system features,

00:04:01.990 --> 00:04:04.860
you have maybe 40
megabytes of user space.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.440
And if a typical APK
is a few megabytes,

00:04:08.440 --> 00:04:11.259
you can only have a few of
those before you can really

00:04:11.259 --> 00:04:12.300
have to stop downloading.

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.383
One of the great things
about progressive web apps

00:04:14.383 --> 00:04:16.250
that Anshoo was
mentioning was that you

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.899
don't have to request that
commitment right up front.

00:04:18.899 --> 00:04:21.117
You can start to build a
relationship with the user

00:04:21.117 --> 00:04:22.200
through the web interface.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:24.871
And over time, the web app
can become more and more

00:04:24.871 --> 00:04:25.620
like a native app.

00:04:25.620 --> 00:04:26.910
It can be housed on a device.

00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:31.172
It can cache content
and work offline.

00:04:31.172 --> 00:04:32.630
ANSHOO: In the last
1 and 1/2 weeks

00:04:32.630 --> 00:04:35.088
that we have been [? here, ?]
based on these conversations,

00:04:35.088 --> 00:04:37.430
we actually launched a micro
version of our platform

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:38.660
on progressive web apps.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:40.400
On the experience is great.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:43.830
Without using the app, people
can get as good an experience.

00:04:43.830 --> 00:04:45.860
TIMOTHY JORDAN: 1 and 1/2 weeks?

00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:46.821
Good work.

00:04:46.821 --> 00:04:48.570
JORDAN: I don't deserve
any of the credit.

00:04:48.570 --> 00:04:50.210
These guys certainly do.

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:52.210
The only problem is that
none of the merchants

00:04:52.210 --> 00:04:53.293
are here in Mountain View.

00:04:53.293 --> 00:04:54.400
They're all in India.

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:56.855
So I will never be
able to try it out.

00:04:56.855 --> 00:04:58.300
I'll have to stop by sometime.

00:04:58.300 --> 00:05:00.050
ANSHOO: We'll find a
way for you to do it.

00:05:06.321 --> 00:05:07.820
TIMOTHY JORDAN: We
now have Sandeep,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:09.141
co-founder of Red Carpet.

00:05:09.141 --> 00:05:10.640
Sandeep, tell us
about your startup.

00:05:10.640 --> 00:05:13.250
SANDEEP: OK, so Red
Carpet basically

00:05:13.250 --> 00:05:17.370
lends to customers in India to
fund their online purchases,

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.310
whether it be e-commerce
or travel or anything.

00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:23.460
Now, in India, credit
and finance companies

00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:26.920
barely service 3% of
the customer base.

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:28.930
Because there is
absolutely no data.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.810
There's no credit bureau
data to score and profile

00:05:31.810 --> 00:05:32.840
these customers.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:35.180
Now, Red Carpet
has actually access

00:05:35.180 --> 00:05:37.410
to much more data,
which includes

00:05:37.410 --> 00:05:39.750
the data on your mobile phone.

00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.570
Therefore, we are now
able to service customers

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:46.071
who have never had credit
in their life before.

00:05:46.071 --> 00:05:47.362
TIMOTHY JORDAN: That's amazing.

00:05:47.362 --> 00:05:49.460
SANDEEP: So India is
basically a country

00:05:49.460 --> 00:05:52.810
where 90% of the economy, which
is a trillion dollar economy,

00:05:52.810 --> 00:05:54.320
is cash, which
includes e-commerce.

00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:56.570
E-commerce is 90% cash.

00:05:56.570 --> 00:05:59.680
So banks, even if they look
at your bank statement,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:01.440
have no data to
process anything.

00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:03.080
There's no transactions.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:06.180
The only transactions that come
up is on your mobile phone.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.860
And that's what we access
to build a profile for you.

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:10.250
TIMOTHY JORDAN: OK.

00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:13.040
And you've been using machine
learning over the last couple

00:06:13.040 --> 00:06:13.939
weeks to help out.

00:06:13.939 --> 00:06:14.480
SANDEEP: Yes.

00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.850
So Francisco-- and
we talked a lot

00:06:17.850 --> 00:06:19.430
about how we can
leverage machine

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:21.990
learning-- Red Carpet is
fundamentally a data science

00:06:21.990 --> 00:06:22.710
company.

00:06:22.710 --> 00:06:26.260
We are one of the very few
companies that combine a people

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:28.360
graph, like I'm
connected to you,

00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:31.840
with historical
transaction data.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:35.290
Now, this falls outside the
realm of traditional machine

00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.790
learning.

00:06:35.790 --> 00:06:38.110
And it's not something that
you can just slap package

00:06:38.110 --> 00:06:39.910
on and have it work.

00:06:39.910 --> 00:06:41.900
So we're a Y Combinator startup.

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.050
And when we applied
to Launchpad,

00:06:44.050 --> 00:06:45.870
one of the key things
we were looking for

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:48.470
is access to the crown
jewels of Google,

00:06:48.470 --> 00:06:51.611
which is like the people who
drive the machine learning.

00:06:51.611 --> 00:06:53.110
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
This guy right here.

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.870
SANDEEP: Now, Francisco
and I talked, I don't know,

00:06:55.870 --> 00:06:58.860
for a couple of-- at
least an hour or so.

00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:02.720
And we came up with
a new way to combine

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:06.040
graph and traditional
data into a new way

00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:09.220
of doing machine learning, which
was pretty freaking awesome

00:07:09.220 --> 00:07:12.180
FRANCISCO URIBE: So
Sandeep's example

00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:15.710
illustrates really the
flexibility of TensorFlow

00:07:15.710 --> 00:07:17.924
programming model.

00:07:17.924 --> 00:07:19.590
Historically, we have
seen in the market

00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.850
that certain tools specialize
in one type of machine learning.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:24.780
And the idea with
TensorFlow is to provide

00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.950
a unified computation platform
so that a team can experiment

00:07:28.950 --> 00:07:33.220
with models for [? sparse ?]
features, for dense features,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.700
or in the case of Sandeep,
look at more complex things

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.150
like graph analysis,
incorporate all of that

00:07:39.150 --> 00:07:40.974
to provide more
accurate predictions.

00:07:40.974 --> 00:07:42.890
TIMOTHY JORDAN: So what's
next for Red Carpet?

00:07:42.890 --> 00:07:46.060
SANDEEP: We want to take all
of this learnings back to India

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.020
and we're probably going to
build India's largest fintech

00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:50.250
company.

00:07:50.250 --> 00:07:51.904
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
That's exciting, man.

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:52.820
Thanks for joining us.

00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:53.495
SANDEEP: Thank you so much.

00:07:53.495 --> 00:07:54.776
TIMOTHY JORDAN:
Ran, we just talked

00:07:54.776 --> 00:07:56.484
to some amazing startups
about their time

00:07:56.484 --> 00:07:57.680
at Launchpad Accelerator.

00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:00.060
They're using progressive
web apps, machine learning

00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:01.781
with TensorFlow, even Firebase.

00:08:01.781 --> 00:08:03.280
If there are startups
out there that

00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.363
want to get involved like
these, where do they go?

00:08:05.363 --> 00:08:08.080
RAN NACHMANY: So check
out our link down below.

00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.620
And we invite you to apply to
the next batch of Launchpad

00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.119
Accelerator.

00:08:11.119 --> 00:08:12.711
We really hope to
see you with us.

00:08:12.711 --> 00:08:13.710
TIMOTHY JORDAN: Awesome.

00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:15.770
And if you'd like to check
out some of the technologies

00:08:15.770 --> 00:08:18.160
that we talked about, we'll
link those below as well.

00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:18.660
See you.

00:08:18.660 --> 00:08:19.960
RAN NACHMANY: Bye.

00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:23.910
