GOPI KALLAYIL: Good afternoon.

00:00:02.380 --> 00:00:05.710
We live in an astonishingly
interesting time in that of

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:08.370
the 7 billion people on the
planet, 2 billion are on the

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.020
internet and 6 billion
have cellphones.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:14.630
So this has become the
most pervasive

00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:16.050
technology in human history.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:19.890
More people carry one of these
devices than have access to

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.720
clean drinking water
or electricity.

00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.700
And arguably, all of this
technology in humanity has

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:30.470
increased the productivity,
but it also means we are

00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:33.050
drowning in the information that
comes towards us through

00:00:33.050 --> 00:00:34.480
these technologies.

00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.290
The amount of email that keeps
flooding towards us and the

00:00:38.290 --> 00:00:43.210
extent to which our lives are
now accessed by other people

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:45.770
sending us information through
all of these media, whether

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:49.460
it's text, or email,
or other means.

00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:52.380
So on the one hand, it does
increase productivity, on the

00:00:52.380 --> 00:00:55.750
other hand, we also
feel overwhelmed.

00:00:55.750 --> 00:01:00.730
Into this field has stepped in
Jared Goralnick, one of the

00:01:00.730 --> 00:01:05.390
foremost experts on how do we
live a more productive, sane,

00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:08.780
and happier life while still
using all of these

00:01:08.780 --> 00:01:09.500
technologies.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:12.440
In fact, Jared was so convinced
about this topic

00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:17.100
that he has become part of the
leadership team at the

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.310
Information Overload
Research Group.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:21.670
He founded two companies.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:25.590
First, a consulting company
to help people deal with

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:27.200
productivity issues.

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:32.910
And currently, he is the
founder/CEO of a company

00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.060
called AwayFind that builds
software to help us deal with

00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:38.850
information overload and
increase our productivity.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:41.910
With that, let me turn it over
to our speaker, Jared

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:45.840
Goralnick, to help us improve
our productivity across all

00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:46.990
forms of our life.

00:01:46.990 --> 00:01:47.710
Jared?

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.490
JARED GORALNICK: That's
quite the intro.

00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:49.540
Thank you so much, Gopi.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:51.390
And thank you all so much
for coming out.

00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:53.940
It's quite a privilege
to be here.

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:55.030
So that's a lot about me.

00:01:55.030 --> 00:01:56.520
I'd love to start by
just learning a

00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:57.330
little bit about you.

00:01:57.330 --> 00:01:59.520
I'll have some general
questions

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.480
and then some specifics.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:03.050
But first off, just out of
curiosity, which teams are

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:04.510
folks coming from?

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:06.020
How many are coming
from Search?

00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:07.025
Some people here.

00:02:07.025 --> 00:02:08.139
OK, Search.

00:02:08.139 --> 00:02:09.729
Ad side of that?

00:02:09.729 --> 00:02:11.000
OK.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:11.370
Gmail?

00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:12.230
I know there's some
Gmail folks.

00:02:12.230 --> 00:02:15.120
Yay, I hope to make an impact
there some day.

00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.500
There will be a little bit of
email in this presentation.

00:02:18.500 --> 00:02:18.940
+?

00:02:18.940 --> 00:02:20.920
We've got some + folks.

00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:22.200
Great.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:23.310
Maps?

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:24.200
I was hoping.

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:25.040
I guess they're busy today.

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:25.990
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE].

00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:26.940
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.740
JARED GORALNICK: Any
other teams?

00:02:27.740 --> 00:02:29.060
What other folks are here?

00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.560
Anybody shout out, feel free.

00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:30.903
AUDIENCE: Android.

00:02:30.903 --> 00:02:31.246
JARED GORALNICK: Android.

00:02:31.246 --> 00:02:32.780
Ah, of course, yes.

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:33.460
AUDIENCE: YouTube.

00:02:33.460 --> 00:02:34.240
JARED GORALNICK:
YouTube, great.

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.320
And also, this is up on
YouTube right now.

00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.540
Any other teams?

00:02:37.540 --> 00:02:37.970
AUDIENCE: Platforms.

00:02:37.970 --> 00:02:39.690
JARED GORALNICK: Platforms,
great.

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.120
Awesome.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:44.080
And then how many of you
folks are engineers?

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.512
How many of you are marketing?

00:02:46.512 --> 00:02:47.850
OK.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:50.070
Product management?

00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:52.840
HR?

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:53.280
Awesome.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.530
Folks helping with video?

00:02:54.530 --> 00:02:55.110
OK, great.

00:02:55.110 --> 00:02:57.440
So we have a bit of a
distribution in here.

00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:01.220
Just in terms of my background,
I sort of still am

00:03:01.220 --> 00:03:01.650
an engineer.

00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:03.550
I do more product now.

00:03:03.550 --> 00:03:05.260
But I was coding at
seven and whatnot.

00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:06.950
And then I went on and got a
software engineering degree.

00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:08.720
But then I got a philosophy
degree.

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.170
And I mention that because a lot
of this is not about these

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:16.180
little tools, it's about the why
we're doing all of this.

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.330
Like my first company
was called

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.420
Software Efficiency Training.

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.590
That's kind of the wrong word
because "efficiency" is sort

00:03:21.590 --> 00:03:22.910
of assembly line stuff.

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:25.330
It's how do you produce
more widgets?

00:03:25.330 --> 00:03:26.940
The word "productivity" is a
little bit better, it sort of

00:03:26.940 --> 00:03:29.330
seems to imply if we're more
productive, we get a little

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:31.700
bit more choice about what we
do that theoretically makes

00:03:31.700 --> 00:03:33.490
more impact or maybe
we can spend more

00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:34.510
time with our family.

00:03:34.510 --> 00:03:36.430
That's the hope of all this.

00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:38.720
And to illustrate that, maybe
I can start with an analogy.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.940
How many of you speak
a second language?

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:43.090
A third language?

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:44.680
Fourth?

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:45.690
Fifth?

00:03:45.690 --> 00:03:47.660
OK, so you, sir, in the back,
in the green shirt, four

00:03:47.660 --> 00:03:49.741
languages, what's one of the
languages you speak?

00:03:49.741 --> 00:03:52.031
AUDIENCE: Well, of course,
English, Hindi, Marathi, and a

00:03:52.031 --> 00:03:52.690
bit of French.

00:03:52.690 --> 00:03:53.880
JARED GORALNICK: And a
bit of French, OK.

00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:56.430
So Marathi, where do you
speak that, in India?

00:03:56.430 --> 00:03:57.350
AUDIENCE: Mostly India.

00:03:57.350 --> 00:04:00.060
JARED GORALNICK: OK, so anybody
here been to India

00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:03.040
that does not speak a
local dialect there?

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:03.710
OK, great.

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:04.960
And what's your name
in the green?

00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:05.926
I'm sorry.

00:04:05.926 --> 00:04:06.280
AUDIENCE: Deborah.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.540
JARED GORALNICK: Deborah.

00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.573
And did you have a good time
when you were in India?

00:04:09.573 --> 00:04:10.480
AUDIENCE: Yeah.

00:04:10.480 --> 00:04:12.100
JARED GORALNICK: It was
an experience, yeah?

00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:15.180
And other folks that went to
India, you probably got a lot

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:16.649
of that experience, but you had
a different experience.

00:04:16.649 --> 00:04:18.329
And I'm sorry, what is
your name again?

00:04:18.329 --> 00:04:19.890
You in the back, I'm sorry.

00:04:19.890 --> 00:04:21.120
I didn't ask you for
your name before.

00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:21.550
Yes?

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:22.070
AUDIENCE: Mans.

00:04:22.070 --> 00:04:22.530
JARED GORALNICK: Mans.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:25.280
OK, so Mans speaks several
local dialects

00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.170
and other folks don't.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:28.500
And they both went to
India and they both

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.840
were able to get by.

00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:32.790
And productivity is actually
kind of like language in that

00:04:32.790 --> 00:04:37.890
way, in that if you have
fluency, there is a lot more

00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:40.800
depth that is possible
in your experiences.

00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:44.950
And without that, you all still
can get a lot done, but

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:47.190
what happens is there's certain
things you just can't

00:04:47.190 --> 00:04:48.270
choose to do.

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:51.180
And I personally believe that
Google does not pay you to be

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.280
productive.

00:04:52.280 --> 00:04:53.300
That's not their goal.

00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.280
Their goal is for you
to do something that

00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:57.350
achieves real scale.

00:04:57.350 --> 00:04:59.590
They want you to do something
that's going to make one

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:01.600
engineer not worth the $1
million and a half that

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.570
they're supposedly worth if you
divide the numbers based

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:07.280
on employees, but more that
they're worth $1 billion

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.080
because they build the next
AdWords, or the next Gmail, or

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.990
the next Android platform.

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.970
So what I'm going to talk about
today is really a series

00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.630
of sort of tools like a language
where I hope you will

00:05:18.630 --> 00:05:21.150
all sort of embrace them because
they're an opportunity

00:05:21.150 --> 00:05:23.430
to then have more freedom
and choice in how

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:24.720
you spend your time.

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.420
And I'm going to start off with
email and with several

00:05:27.420 --> 00:05:27.990
little tweaks.

00:05:27.990 --> 00:05:30.290
These are kind of like the
vocabulary of a language.

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:32.530
They are little things that you
can change and that you

00:05:32.530 --> 00:05:35.010
can do right away that can
make what I hope to be a

00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:36.310
dramatic impact.

00:05:36.310 --> 00:05:39.080
The second part of my
presentation will be about

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:41.410
some of the techniques and
sort of the concepts, or

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:44.250
almost like the grammar in a
language and how this applies.

00:05:44.250 --> 00:05:46.030
And the reason why I'm going
back to language is because,

00:05:46.030 --> 00:05:49.820
again, how many people are
familiar with like "Getting

00:05:49.820 --> 00:05:51.860
Things Done?" OK.

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:53.570
How many are productivity
adherents to some kind of

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.792
system or another?

00:05:54.792 --> 00:05:56.030
Right?

00:05:56.030 --> 00:05:56.480
OK, cool.

00:05:56.480 --> 00:05:58.980
So it's good that you're not all
that way because I think

00:05:58.980 --> 00:06:01.695
these systems, it's sort of like
being like, oh, I'm an

00:06:01.695 --> 00:06:04.060
Agile guy, or oh, I'm a Python
guy, or like all

00:06:04.060 --> 00:06:04.730
these little labels.

00:06:04.730 --> 00:06:06.630
That's not what I want
this to be about.

00:06:06.630 --> 00:06:08.970
I want this to be about
something where we recognize

00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:12.410
that these are tools that are
necessary if we want to avoid

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:15.050
that sudden death that I
mentioned in here, if we want

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.170
to be able to get off that
hamster wheel and

00:06:17.170 --> 00:06:19.110
do something important.

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:22.820
So starting with a pretty simple
thing, if you're on

00:06:22.820 --> 00:06:24.740
Google+, and you're on Facebook,
and you're on

00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:27.750
Twitter, and even Amazon, all
these sites, they send you a

00:06:27.750 --> 00:06:29.780
lot of emails, right?

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.950
But most of those emails are
things that we never need to

00:06:32.950 --> 00:06:34.270
let into our life.

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:36.600
So it's very easy to change
the inputs in our life.

00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:38.970
And one of the easiest ways to
do that is just simply to

00:06:38.970 --> 00:06:40.680
unsubscribe from the messages
we don't need.

00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:44.470
We as product folks know that
all these messages are how we

00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:46.740
build engagement, all these
emails we send to folks.

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.050
And of course, Google+ does
that when I get a new

00:06:49.050 --> 00:06:50.560
connection and so forth.

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.110
But I would encourage you to
just spend five minutes

00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.770
sometime later today, all of
these slides are up, the link

00:06:55.770 --> 00:06:57.370
is at the end of this.

00:06:57.370 --> 00:06:58.920
But I would encourage you
to spend five minutes.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:00.390
You can go to notifymenot.com.

00:07:00.390 --> 00:07:02.790
That's a site that I created
that walks through all the

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:05.700
sites, or many of the major
sites, and tells you how to

00:07:05.700 --> 00:07:07.820
turn off some of the
notifications.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:10.080
But instead, if you just get
the personal messages that

00:07:10.080 --> 00:07:14.680
come from +, or from Facebook,
or from Flickr, or from

00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.280
Amazon, or whatever
it happens to be.

00:07:17.280 --> 00:07:19.950
On Amazon the example would be
like the shipment changed its

00:07:19.950 --> 00:07:20.750
arrival date.

00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:22.620
You don't need to know that
the shipment was made, it

00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:23.640
always is made.

00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:25.620
It's only if there's an alert
that actually demands your

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:27.910
attention that it should ever
show up in your inbox.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:31.130
So if you change these inputs,
you'll have less stuff sort of

00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:33.530
weighing you down.

00:07:33.530 --> 00:07:37.160
And then similarly, Gopi, you
talked about 6 billion phones

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:38.180
or something.

00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:39.490
It's amazing.

00:07:39.490 --> 00:07:42.680
We carry these things in our
pockets that have this amazing

00:07:42.680 --> 00:07:46.050
ability to connect us, but also
to pull us away from what

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:47.990
we're doing right now.

00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:50.570
Nobody wakes up in the morning
and says they want to check

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.180
their email all day and
that's where they want

00:07:52.180 --> 00:07:52.910
to spend their time.

00:07:52.910 --> 00:07:55.690
But similarly, nobody walks
into a meeting and says, I

00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:57.490
can't wait to find out about
the stuff that's happening

00:07:57.490 --> 00:07:58.200
outside of here.

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.070
Or maybe if it's a certain kind
of meeting, you might

00:08:00.070 --> 00:08:01.370
feel that way.

00:08:01.370 --> 00:08:05.040
But we, in just about one or two
minutes, can turn off all

00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:06.180
of those notifications.

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:10.040
Because probably 1 in every 100
of those messages really

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.490
demands our time right now.

00:08:13.490 --> 00:08:16.610
And there's a URL there again
for how to turn those off on

00:08:16.610 --> 00:08:18.315
Android and other devices.

00:08:18.315 --> 00:08:20.580
How many of you have more
than 100 messages in

00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:22.990
your inbox right now?

00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:24.110
Great that a lot of
the Gmail people

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:25.370
didn't raise their hand.

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:28.300
More than 1,000?

00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.030
More than 15,000?

00:08:30.030 --> 00:08:30.530
OK, good.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.870
So 10,000, that's a
lot of messages.

00:08:33.870 --> 00:08:35.610
It's interesting.

00:08:35.610 --> 00:08:38.360
What I like to think of the
inbox as, it's the place where

00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:42.150
other people set your agenda.

00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:43.520
So compare it to a task list.

00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:44.990
A task list has two things.

00:08:44.990 --> 00:08:45.960
There's only two things
that are important

00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:46.800
about a task list.

00:08:46.800 --> 00:08:49.950
One is that you can change
the order around.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:51.890
And two is that you can give
it a title that you

00:08:51.890 --> 00:08:53.340
understand, that you
can work with.

00:08:53.340 --> 00:08:56.710
Whereas email, you could be
doing Re: hey, and it could

00:08:56.710 --> 00:08:58.320
have some important assignment
in there.

00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:00.710
Or it could relate to something
a bunch of steps

00:09:00.710 --> 00:09:05.250
down after the conversation
changed topics three times.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:07.510
And then, of course, it's just
chronological based on when

00:09:07.510 --> 00:09:08.470
somebody sent it to you.

00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:11.770
It's a really awful place to
spend a lot of your day.

00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:16.140
So anything you can do to get
things out of your inbox is a

00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:17.280
very positive thing.

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.050
It's the place where
you don't want your

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:20.480
attention to be sapped.

00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:22.450
And you definitely don't want to
be seeing the same message

00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.690
over and over.

00:09:23.690 --> 00:09:26.780
So I think there's this
technology that you guys have

00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:28.330
in Gmail that allows you
to find messages

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:29.240
that have been archived.

00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:30.500
I won't name it, there's
some people who work

00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:31.790
on that team here.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:33.640
But you can use that to
find those messages.

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.560
And I encourage you to
press Archive All.

00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:39.250
And then it gives you another
option that lets you literally

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:42.220
archive everything in your
entire inbox, not just those

00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.325
20 or 50 messages
on that screen.

00:09:44.325 --> 00:09:45.710
And Gopi, you went
through that.

00:09:45.710 --> 00:09:47.826
How was that experience?

00:09:47.826 --> 00:09:48.324
GOPI KALLAYIL: Scary.

00:09:48.324 --> 00:09:49.320
Jumping off a cliff.

00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:49.850
JARED GORALNICK: Scary?

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:50.440
And what happened?

00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:52.796
Did you land after you
got off the cliff?

00:09:52.796 --> 00:09:53.730
GOPI KALLAYIL: I survived.

00:09:53.730 --> 00:09:55.940
JARED GORALNICK: For a little
while, it feels quite amazing.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:58.590
And if you can maintain, it's
not that you need inbox zero,

00:09:58.590 --> 00:10:00.620
it's that you just don't want
to constantly be revisiting

00:10:00.620 --> 00:10:05.310
things and having that feeling
of not knowing what's next.

00:10:05.310 --> 00:10:07.870
And here's a picture up here.

00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:08.790
This is Suzanne here.

00:10:08.790 --> 00:10:11.200
This picture was
taken in 1985.

00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:12.250
She's pretty cute.

00:10:12.250 --> 00:10:14.770
I was all right back then when
I was four years old.

00:10:14.770 --> 00:10:17.370
But I have a feeling that
she has moved on.

00:10:17.370 --> 00:10:20.870
I know I have to sort of give
up on this opportunity here.

00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.220
And this message has been
uploaded all over

00:10:23.220 --> 00:10:24.150
the place by now.

00:10:24.150 --> 00:10:26.960
I think I can delete
it from my inbox.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.155
I think a lot of the reason why
we have so many messages

00:10:29.155 --> 00:10:31.980
is because we think there's
something we need to find.

00:10:31.980 --> 00:10:34.130
But we have tools to find it.

00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.040
So whether you're archiving or
you're deleting, you've got to

00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.590
move on from those messages.

00:10:38.590 --> 00:10:41.460
And I think you'll find yourself
so much more sane and

00:10:41.460 --> 00:10:44.500
so much more able to do things
that are remarkable.

00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:48.780
And I've already talked about
what enters into your inbox

00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:51.700
and what grabs your attention
from your mobile device or

00:10:51.700 --> 00:10:53.360
maybe some of you even
have pop-ups.

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.940
Not in Outlook, but you might
have one of those Chrome

00:10:55.940 --> 00:10:58.650
extensions that shows you
when you get new mail.

00:10:58.650 --> 00:11:01.790
Turn those off and don't
continue to check email.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:05.100
I have spent much of my career
focused on this concept of

00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:06.390
interruptions.

00:11:06.390 --> 00:11:08.300
And that's what my product
does, AwayFind.

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:11.490
I don't know if you're aware,
but we lose about four minutes

00:11:11.490 --> 00:11:14.790
to every interruption and the
rabbit hole it sends us down.

00:11:14.790 --> 00:11:16.600
Studies show that if you're
getting over 100 messages a

00:11:16.600 --> 00:11:20.405
day, that will turn into about
a quarter of your day is lost

00:11:20.405 --> 00:11:23.110
in interruptions and the time it
takes to get back on track.

00:11:23.110 --> 00:11:28.500
And the main step to fixing that
is closing your inbox,

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:30.650
closing your Gmail
more of the day.

00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:34.000
You will never forget to check
it, I promise you.

00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.460
So close it, not just
during the holidays.

00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:38.340
And if you'd like to learn more
about that, you can go to

00:11:38.340 --> 00:11:39.250
awayfind.com.

00:11:39.250 --> 00:11:41.530
I don't know if you're allowed
to use my product at Google,

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.910
but there is a guide to not
checking email that's been

00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:46.270
downloaded over 100,000 times.

00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:48.240
And that's just free as
part of our setup.

00:11:48.240 --> 00:11:49.280
And I hope it helps.

00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.570
It gives some more tactical
steps for this material.

00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:54.350
So that's it for email.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:58.460
Any quick questions about email
stuff before I jump on?

00:11:58.460 --> 00:12:00.260
We'll have a chance at the end
if you guys want to hear all

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:02.930
my opinions about things
that could happen in

00:12:02.930 --> 00:12:05.320
change in that world.

00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:08.260
Second section here is
about productivity.

00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:12.330
And first off, those of you
that raised your hand with

00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:14.270
"Getting Things Done," you're
familiar with the mind like

00:12:14.270 --> 00:12:15.180
water metaphor?

00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:17.140
Anybody remember that,
mind like water?

00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.760
Great, is it something that's
been helpful to you?

00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:21.085
Have you ever applied that?

00:12:21.085 --> 00:12:21.570
AUDIENCE: I did.

00:12:21.570 --> 00:12:23.510
I sat still and made
a crazy long list.

00:12:23.510 --> 00:12:25.395
And I achieved mind like
water, and then I had

00:12:25.395 --> 00:12:27.007
a crazy long list.

00:12:27.007 --> 00:12:28.348
I didn't know what to do next.

00:12:28.348 --> 00:12:29.690
I'm hoping you can tell
me right now.

00:12:29.690 --> 00:12:31.220
JARED GORALNICK: I will
tell you right now.

00:12:31.220 --> 00:12:32.160
AUDIENCE: Right now.

00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:32.520
JARED GORALNICK: OK.

00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.010
So mind like water, it's the
concept that if you picture a

00:12:35.010 --> 00:12:38.750
little pond, and you picture a
rock falling into that pond,

00:12:38.750 --> 00:12:41.390
how does the pond respond?

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:43.900
Exactly appropriately, it makes
little ripples at the

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.240
angle, and weight, and momentum,
et cetera, based on

00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:47.660
how you dropped that
rock in there.

00:12:47.660 --> 00:12:50.170
Now picture yourself having
a harried day.

00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:52.120
Maybe this afternoon is going
to be particularly busy for

00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:53.860
you and you just crammed
this session in.

00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:56.160
And somebody comes to you
and says, you know what?

00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.650
There's this bug, and it's
actually live, and it's a

00:12:58.650 --> 00:12:59.780
really big issue.

00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:00.710
Now, how do you respond?

00:13:00.710 --> 00:13:03.210
Do you respond appropriately
by walking over to your

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:04.940
terminal, looking at what's
going on, seeing how many

00:13:04.940 --> 00:13:05.330
people are doing it?

00:13:05.330 --> 00:13:08.060
Or do you flip out and scream
because you're thinking about

00:13:08.060 --> 00:13:10.100
the people you have to pick up
later today, you're thinking

00:13:10.100 --> 00:13:12.210
about the other tasks you have
to do, you're thinking about

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:13.040
all this stuff going on?

00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.640
You are not like that rock
falling into the pond if you

00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:20.190
have all kinds of things
on your mind.

00:13:20.190 --> 00:13:22.930
So the goal of any productivity
system, anything,

00:13:22.930 --> 00:13:25.540
it doesn't matter, is to get
things out of your head and

00:13:25.540 --> 00:13:28.650
into a place that you can trust
so that when new things

00:13:28.650 --> 00:13:31.820
come at you, or when you get to
an item on your task list,

00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.270
you can actually focus on that
and not be overwhelmed by all

00:13:35.270 --> 00:13:36.380
that other stuff.

00:13:36.380 --> 00:13:40.050
Now, the first step to getting
things out of your head is

00:13:40.050 --> 00:13:41.790
putting it somewhere else.

00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:43.960
Now, you could put it
into Google Tasks.

00:13:43.960 --> 00:13:46.740
You could put it into some other
project management tool.

00:13:46.740 --> 00:13:49.560
But the main thing is just
getting it out of your head

00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:51.530
because the reality is you're
probably not going to get

00:13:51.530 --> 00:13:52.410
through all those things.

00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:54.980
But the first thing, the first
step, is to literally just

00:13:54.980 --> 00:13:55.930
write it all down.

00:13:55.930 --> 00:13:59.740
It's cathartic, it's liberating,
it's amazing, just

00:13:59.740 --> 00:14:00.780
getting it out of your head.

00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.190
Now, you're right, you're
going to end up with

00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:03.560
this big task list.

00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.590
And that might seem
overwhelming.

00:14:06.590 --> 00:14:08.900
But first off, you can at
least reorganize that as

00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:10.490
opposed to like your
inbox and whatnot.

00:14:10.490 --> 00:14:13.270
But second of all, you're going
to probably find that

00:14:13.270 --> 00:14:14.810
you'll never get to half
of your tasks.

00:14:14.810 --> 00:14:16.000
I mean, there are things
you have to do.

00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.380
There's a deadline, you
need to show up

00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:18.410
somewhere, or whatever.

00:14:18.410 --> 00:14:21.380
But there's a lot of tasks
you will never get to.

00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.690
And we have to accept that.

00:14:22.690 --> 00:14:24.810
We all in this room have to
accept that there is more in

00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:27.700
life that we want to
do than we will be

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.200
able to actually do.

00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:31.440
But at least get it out of your
head and have it there in

00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:34.220
a bucket list, so maybe even
five years from now you will

00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:34.940
get back to it.

00:14:34.940 --> 00:14:37.300
Just get it out of your head,
and that's the first step.

00:14:37.300 --> 00:14:38.880
Knowing that is there
is totally fine.

00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:41.340
I recognize that I have a to-do
list for today that I

00:14:41.340 --> 00:14:43.870
actually care about and that I
have a giant list that's out

00:14:43.870 --> 00:14:46.100
of sight, out of mind, and maybe
that doesn't sound so

00:14:46.100 --> 00:14:49.120
good, but it feels a heck
of a lot better.

00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.750
So get yourself that
mind like water.

00:14:51.750 --> 00:14:54.670
And then, you guys are a company
that focuses on data.

00:14:54.670 --> 00:14:56.540
You have lots of things
you can measure.

00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.070
And now quantified self, we
have like seven different

00:14:59.070 --> 00:15:01.700
devices we can carry around
on ourselves to measure

00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.300
everything we do.

00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.640
I got into social media
a long time ago.

00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:07.610
I mean, now I'm not.

00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:09.570
We don't even say we're into
social media, that's not cool.

00:15:09.570 --> 00:15:12.360
But back in like 2006 and 2007,
when things were really

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:15.080
starting to heat up again with
blogs, and Twitter was coming

00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.800
on to the fore, and we were
all watching our follower

00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.740
count, and our friend number,
and all that stuff.

00:15:19.740 --> 00:15:22.550
And there's all these numbers
that are around us.

00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:26.370
And if you find that you're
checking statistics all the

00:15:26.370 --> 00:15:29.310
time, regardless of what
statistics they are, think

00:15:29.310 --> 00:15:31.450
about whether it's something
that is a key performance

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:34.200
indicator for the value of your
work or something you're

00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:35.830
trying to change in your life.

00:15:35.830 --> 00:15:38.310
Because if it's not, there's a
good chance it's more just

00:15:38.310 --> 00:15:39.240
weighing you down.

00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:41.490
And maybe it makes you feel good
when you get that extra

00:15:41.490 --> 00:15:44.670
number or maybe it makes you
feel awful, but if it doesn't

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:47.560
really change something in your
life or in your work,

00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:50.610
maybe you should just
stop checking it.

00:15:50.610 --> 00:15:52.080
There's probably a lot
of numbers around.

00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:54.130
You think about which ones
you can let go of.

00:15:54.130 --> 00:15:56.980
Maybe do it once a week or
maybe set a Cron job that

00:15:56.980 --> 00:15:59.200
sends it to you once a week so
you don't have to check it

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.530
every three hours if
there's been new

00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:03.860
sign ups on your product.

00:16:03.860 --> 00:16:05.770
Another thing, it's called
the Pomodoro

00:16:05.770 --> 00:16:07.360
Technique or Pomodoro Method.

00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:09.350
I see a lot of folks here
are familiar with that.

00:16:09.350 --> 00:16:12.880
It's the idea of getting
yourself into something for 50

00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:17.400
minutes and focusing on it and
then moving on for about 10

00:16:17.400 --> 00:16:21.250
minutes and maybe going to one
of your mini cafes, or talking

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:24.060
to someone, or having some
other kind of challenge.

00:16:24.060 --> 00:16:27.290
You can google Pomodoro, like
the type of tomato.

00:16:27.290 --> 00:16:28.580
And this is just one
of the techniques.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:30.590
I'm going to go into flow
a little bit more.

00:16:30.590 --> 00:16:33.420
But this is just one of the many
concepts I think that's

00:16:33.420 --> 00:16:34.980
worth researching if
you're getting into

00:16:34.980 --> 00:16:37.870
this type of material.

00:16:37.870 --> 00:16:41.870
We've got folks here from the +
team, and I love your little

00:16:41.870 --> 00:16:43.780
notification that pops
up all the time.

00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:50.340
But we as people who are
knowledge workers, we do have

00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.350
other responsibilities besides
the main task at hand.

00:16:53.350 --> 00:16:55.910
And in that 10 minutes or in
that time that you dedicate to

00:16:55.910 --> 00:16:59.370
doing social media or keeping
up with other things, I'd

00:16:59.370 --> 00:17:02.250
recommend going 100%
into those things.

00:17:02.250 --> 00:17:06.230
Jump into that stream of social
media, or of analytics,

00:17:06.230 --> 00:17:08.520
or whatever it happens to be,
and then get out of it.

00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:10.630
As opposed to having the little
alerts that pop up at

00:17:10.630 --> 00:17:11.200
different times.

00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:13.690
This is just like with email,
but with other things.

00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:18.329
It's OK to have distractions,
but I recommend batching them,

00:17:18.329 --> 00:17:19.410
putting them in one
little place.

00:17:19.410 --> 00:17:24.240
Jump into that stream, and
then jump out of it.

00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:25.500
And also unplug.

00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:27.079
I mentioned making
a giant list.

00:17:27.079 --> 00:17:29.420
I mentioned pressing Archive
All to get a

00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:31.670
little bit more clarity.

00:17:31.670 --> 00:17:35.020
But it's amazing, I bought
the most expensive

00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:36.290
paper I could buy.

00:17:36.290 --> 00:17:41.400
I think it was $15 for 108
brightness and 32 pound paper,

00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:42.760
whatever it happens to be.

00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:45.790
But it is liberating to just
have that sheet of paper and

00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:47.120
get those ideas out.

00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.720
It's true, there's going to be
periods where you have to

00:17:48.720 --> 00:17:53.020
spend 6, or 20, or 50 hours over
a certain period of time

00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:56.090
writing an article or coding a
particular module, whatever it

00:17:56.090 --> 00:17:57.190
happens to be.

00:17:57.190 --> 00:17:59.170
But there are times where you
really just need clarity and

00:17:59.170 --> 00:18:02.380
there's just something to be
said for paper or turning off

00:18:02.380 --> 00:18:03.760
the internet.

00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:06.050
So try to add that into
your routine.

00:18:06.050 --> 00:18:09.870
Anybody ever been productive on
a train or a plane before?

00:18:09.870 --> 00:18:12.150
Why not recreate that one
hour of every day, that

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:13.620
opportunity?

00:18:13.620 --> 00:18:16.480
In my mornings, I try to have
a bit of time every day

00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.020
without internet activity.

00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:20.740
And it's amazing what you can
get done in that period.

00:18:20.740 --> 00:18:23.050
Even if you have a few sites you
need for that work, just

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:26.360
bring them up and in a tab in
Chrome, and then do the other

00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:28.250
stuff, and you have
them there.

00:18:28.250 --> 00:18:30.070
And even make a list for the
things you're going to have to

00:18:30.070 --> 00:18:30.950
do when you're back online.

00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.870
But it's amazing what you'll
get done a little bit when

00:18:33.870 --> 00:18:35.030
you're offline.

00:18:35.030 --> 00:18:36.500
Plus, you have your phones
and a million

00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.190
other ways to connect.

00:18:38.190 --> 00:18:40.090
I even like taking this further
and creating what I

00:18:40.090 --> 00:18:43.500
like to call a "cone of
silence." This idea that you

00:18:43.500 --> 00:18:46.590
literally just have one thing
you're super focused on.

00:18:46.590 --> 00:18:50.520
And I know I keep drilling
into this point.

00:18:50.520 --> 00:18:53.560
But it's interesting
with email.

00:18:53.560 --> 00:18:56.710
Most of us consume it at various
points in our day and

00:18:56.710 --> 00:18:58.600
probably various points
in an hour.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.910
I think studies range between
18 to 36 times per hour.

00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:04.430
You guys have much better
data on that, I'm sure.

00:19:04.430 --> 00:19:07.910
But that was in the most recent
Gloria Mark study.

00:19:07.910 --> 00:19:09.370
They referenced that.

00:19:09.370 --> 00:19:11.830
That's a lot of time to
constantly check your email.

00:19:11.830 --> 00:19:13.880
That means that any given one
task you're doing, you're

00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:15.750
spending less than four
minutes on it.

00:19:15.750 --> 00:19:18.890
The truth is, though, if you
make email your job, if you

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.450
literally say, for the next 45
minutes I'm going to do email,

00:19:22.450 --> 00:19:24.600
you will get through what you
need to get through in there.

00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.690
You'll be able to process it,
create tasks from it.

00:19:26.690 --> 00:19:28.480
You can all watch the
Inbox Zero talk

00:19:28.480 --> 00:19:29.540
that was Merlin Mann.

00:19:29.540 --> 00:19:31.270
You probably have all seen
it, that he did here.

00:19:31.270 --> 00:19:32.890
It's a great way to learn
all the processing

00:19:32.890 --> 00:19:33.880
techniques for email.

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.400
But if you give yourself 40
minutes to really get into

00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:41.200
that inbox, or really get into
that article, or that UX

00:19:41.200 --> 00:19:44.370
workflow, or whatever it happens
to be, it's insane

00:19:44.370 --> 00:19:45.350
what you can get out of it.

00:19:45.350 --> 00:19:48.030
And I know, again, I'm stressing
the same point, but

00:19:48.030 --> 00:19:50.360
give yourself that cone of
silence and you will do

00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:53.180
something amazing with
that period of time.

00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:55.490
Also, think about the essential
and the incidental.

00:19:55.490 --> 00:19:58.390
There's a URL here,
bit.ly/thecriticalpath.

00:19:58.390 --> 00:20:00.430
And I have a whole article that
I talk about how to write

00:20:00.430 --> 00:20:01.630
out a sheet of paper and
figure out what your

00:20:01.630 --> 00:20:02.790
critical path is.

00:20:02.790 --> 00:20:06.660
But the concept of critical path
refers to at the end of

00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:10.050
this year, at the end of this
quarter, or just in my life,

00:20:10.050 --> 00:20:12.580
here's something that really,
really needs to happen.

00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:15.140
Maybe it's that we get a million
users, maybe it's that

00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:17.800
we increase adoption by this
percent, maybe it's that we

00:20:17.800 --> 00:20:19.860
bring on this many brands to
our product, whatever it

00:20:19.860 --> 00:20:20.990
happens to be.

00:20:20.990 --> 00:20:24.420
But if you look at your task
list, that giant list you have

00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:27.390
of 100 plus items, I will bet
you that most of those things,

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:30.010
probably more than half of them,
won't actually relate to

00:20:30.010 --> 00:20:31.810
that specific goal.

00:20:31.810 --> 00:20:34.680
And that's what's fascinating is
we have this critical path

00:20:34.680 --> 00:20:36.290
and most things aren't on it.

00:20:36.290 --> 00:20:39.120
And then all of a sudden it gets
really easy if you say to

00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:41.500
yourself, in the mornings, I'm
never going to do something

00:20:41.500 --> 00:20:43.080
that's not on my
critical path.

00:20:43.080 --> 00:20:45.040
I know I have to respond to
emails, I know there's this

00:20:45.040 --> 00:20:47.150
birthday thing coming up, I
know there's these talks I

00:20:47.150 --> 00:20:47.645
want to see.

00:20:47.645 --> 00:20:49.450
But in my mornings, I'm only
going to do things on my

00:20:49.450 --> 00:20:52.000
critical path.

00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:54.780
And amazingly, you will
get forward with it.

00:20:54.780 --> 00:20:57.070
It's just like the whole if you
spend 30 minutes a day on

00:20:57.070 --> 00:20:59.780
something forever, you're going
to be the world's expert

00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.630
in that thing or one of.

00:21:01.630 --> 00:21:04.250
So consider what is incidental
and what is

00:21:04.250 --> 00:21:06.050
essential, what is critical.

00:21:06.050 --> 00:21:07.760
And try to fill your
day as much as

00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:08.630
possible with those things.

00:21:08.630 --> 00:21:12.300
It's a really great heuristic
for limiting tasks.

00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:14.570
And then circadian rhythms.

00:21:14.570 --> 00:21:16.690
This is one of these concepts
that sounds kind of

00:21:16.690 --> 00:21:17.600
loosey-goosey, I don't know.

00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:19.435
Like I have different
flow states at

00:21:19.435 --> 00:21:19.900
different times of day.

00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:22.960
But the reality is, if you
think about it, you have

00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:25.700
different energy levels at
different times of the day.

00:21:25.700 --> 00:21:28.750
And if you have the ability to
manipulate your schedule a

00:21:28.750 --> 00:21:31.640
little bit, you can structure
it so that you do the right

00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:33.450
work for that energy level.

00:21:33.450 --> 00:21:34.440
So for me, what does
that mean?

00:21:34.440 --> 00:21:37.000
It means that I don't do
meetings before lunch.

00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:37.710
Why is that?

00:21:37.710 --> 00:21:41.710
It's because I have energy and
I have focus at that time,

00:21:41.710 --> 00:21:42.990
before lunch that is.

00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.220
I do my most creative
work before lunch.

00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:47.140
And that's amazing for me.

00:21:47.140 --> 00:21:49.440
Now when I'm sitting down in
a meeting, particularly if

00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:51.600
there's a cup of coffee or
something, I mean I am going

00:21:51.600 --> 00:21:52.340
to have no trouble.

00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:54.580
If I'm sitting with Gopi at 3:00
in the afternoon, he has

00:21:54.580 --> 00:21:56.190
my attention, I'm never
going to mess that up.

00:21:56.190 --> 00:22:00.100
But if I'm sitting with an
article to write or a spec to

00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.390
draw out, I'm going to find
everything else to do, and I'm

00:22:02.390 --> 00:22:04.810
going to be completely all over
the place because I don't

00:22:04.810 --> 00:22:07.420
have the same attention
in the afternoons.

00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:11.110
So think about how your day
works and your energy levels,

00:22:11.110 --> 00:22:13.040
and see if there's a way you
can adapt your day a

00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:14.320
little bit to it.

00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.240
And along the same line, just
walking down the cafeteria

00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:20.890
here I see lots of people eating
food that who knows if

00:22:20.890 --> 00:22:22.520
it's the best thing for them
to be eating right now in

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.990
terms of giving themself
energy for

00:22:23.990 --> 00:22:24.440
the rest of the day.

00:22:24.440 --> 00:22:27.100
But think about how the
food you consume

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:28.350
relates to your energy.

00:22:28.350 --> 00:22:32.260
For me, for example, I do all
protein in the morning and

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:33.750
just about all protein
in the afternoon.

00:22:33.750 --> 00:22:35.010
Or rather, I don't
touch carbs.

00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:37.090
It's not that I do
all protein.

00:22:37.090 --> 00:22:38.960
And by cutting carbs out
of my morning and my

00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.290
afternoon, it's amazing.

00:22:41.290 --> 00:22:42.960
When I used to eat cereal or
bagels in morning, which I

00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:46.850
loved, I would be tired
or at like 10:30 or

00:22:46.850 --> 00:22:47.760
11:00 I'd be hungry.

00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.240
And I'm not saying that's the
solution for you, but it's

00:22:50.240 --> 00:22:53.590
amazing how we really are slaves
to our bodies and we

00:22:53.590 --> 00:22:57.900
can really schedule our days and
consider our intakes based

00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.850
on these kinds of things.

00:23:00.850 --> 00:23:04.170
And this is actually
my last slide here.

00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.280
It's coming near the
end of the year.

00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:09.950
And it's one of those times
where we start looking back

00:23:09.950 --> 00:23:11.550
and thinking about the things
we've accomplished.

00:23:11.550 --> 00:23:13.190
And I've been doing a
bit of that lately.

00:23:15.700 --> 00:23:17.380
Maybe this won't come as a
surprise, but I've realized

00:23:17.380 --> 00:23:21.415
the things that have made the
biggest impact on my company

00:23:21.415 --> 00:23:24.740
and upon myself, there's
two things about them.

00:23:24.740 --> 00:23:29.160
One is that those things were
never assigned to me.

00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:30.220
Nobody told me to do that.

00:23:30.220 --> 00:23:33.690
My investors, my board,
my team, friends

00:23:33.690 --> 00:23:34.820
didn't suggest it.

00:23:34.820 --> 00:23:37.150
I'm sure you've probably seen
that users of your products

00:23:37.150 --> 00:23:39.970
rarely suggest the things that
are the best features because

00:23:39.970 --> 00:23:41.440
they're not in it
the same way.

00:23:41.440 --> 00:23:43.780
Maybe they are, but generally
speaking, they're thinking one

00:23:43.780 --> 00:23:46.480
step out and you're thinking
four steps out.

00:23:46.480 --> 00:23:48.660
And for me, I found that, again,
those things weren't

00:23:48.660 --> 00:23:49.590
assigned to me.

00:23:49.590 --> 00:23:52.230
And similarly, they were
the things where I had

00:23:52.230 --> 00:23:54.890
to put in 100 hours.

00:23:54.890 --> 00:23:56.430
Even though I probably could
have done that same thing in

00:23:56.430 --> 00:23:58.550
10 hours and it would've
been OK.

00:23:58.550 --> 00:24:02.070
So there's a lot of things in
your job that you do that you

00:24:02.070 --> 00:24:04.950
do good enough, you maybe even
do it really well because

00:24:04.950 --> 00:24:06.230
you're just a smart person.

00:24:06.230 --> 00:24:07.710
Everybody in this room, I'm
sure, is incredibly

00:24:07.710 --> 00:24:08.580
intelligent.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:12.970
And then there's other things,
though, that you probably know

00:24:12.970 --> 00:24:15.720
you could either do it better
or, even more, it's the area

00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.250
where you are just
like the best.

00:24:17.250 --> 00:24:19.240
There's something where you're
in the 99 point something

00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.880
percentile.

00:24:20.880 --> 00:24:23.770
And when you do those things,
you've probably found that you

00:24:23.770 --> 00:24:25.940
can get amazing results
with that.

00:24:25.940 --> 00:24:28.810
So when I write like my guide to
not checking email, it was

00:24:28.810 --> 00:24:30.120
just something that nobody
told me to do.

00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.730
And it got amazing, amazing
attention from it.

00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.850
There's certain things that
I've done in my life, like

00:24:35.850 --> 00:24:38.420
when I wrote the guide to
Outlook versus Gmail, that,

00:24:38.420 --> 00:24:41.070
back in the day, got hundreds of
thousands of views and made

00:24:41.070 --> 00:24:41.830
it to the front page of Digg.

00:24:41.830 --> 00:24:45.230
And it was this giant article
that was a big risk for me,

00:24:45.230 --> 00:24:47.270
but I put everything into it.

00:24:47.270 --> 00:24:49.710
And every time I've put
everything into something,

00:24:49.710 --> 00:24:52.280
I've got insane results back.

00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:54.580
So when you think about your
to-do lists, think about

00:24:54.580 --> 00:24:56.990
what's not on your to-do
list and think about

00:24:56.990 --> 00:24:58.190
what you're best at.

00:24:58.190 --> 00:25:01.360
And maybe you can do something
that's remarkable as opposed

00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:03.090
to something that's
just productive.

00:25:03.090 --> 00:25:06.070
Hopefully with fluency in these
tools, you can free up a

00:25:06.070 --> 00:25:07.360
little bit of time
in your days.

00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:10.370
Maybe you have that 20% time,
maybe it feels like you have

00:25:10.370 --> 00:25:11.920
the 20% percent time
but don't.

00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:15.200
But if you can have that time to
do something that is going

00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:18.770
to scale, I think you'll
be amazed with what

00:25:18.770 --> 00:25:20.570
comes out of it.

00:25:20.570 --> 00:25:23.820
So you can get in touch
with me by Google.

00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:26.440
No, you don't have to do
that, I'm just kidding.

00:25:26.440 --> 00:25:28.105
Here's my information.

00:25:28.105 --> 00:25:30.126
I'd love to keep in touch with
all of you, but now I have

00:25:30.126 --> 00:25:31.360
time for questions.

00:25:31.360 --> 00:25:33.560
Actually, well, I'll bring up
my calendar for one sec just

00:25:33.560 --> 00:25:36.270
to show kind of a
quick tip here.

00:25:36.270 --> 00:25:40.980
So here's yesterday
on my calendar.

00:25:40.980 --> 00:25:42.910
And I think you're bringing that
up because we had talked

00:25:42.910 --> 00:25:45.920
about this stuff last
time we had met.

00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:48.240
Has anybody ever been
to an appointment?

00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:49.730
What's your name, sir,
in the blue?

00:25:49.730 --> 00:25:50.280
What is it?

00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:50.530
AUDIENCE: Frank.

00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:51.030
JARED GORALNICK: Frank.

00:25:51.030 --> 00:25:53.640
Have you ever scheduled an
appointment that says meeting

00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:54.770
with Frank?

00:25:54.770 --> 00:25:57.460
Has somebody ever sent you
that calendar invite?

00:25:57.460 --> 00:25:59.850
How useful is that to you?

00:25:59.850 --> 00:26:00.940
We all do that.

00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:03.050
Well, actually, I don't do that
anymore, it's terrible.

00:26:03.050 --> 00:26:04.620
I laugh at people when
they do that.

00:26:04.620 --> 00:26:07.170
Every single time I create an
appointment, I put what kind

00:26:07.170 --> 00:26:10.720
of appointment it is, coffee,
Skype, lunch, colon.

00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.880
And then I put my name first
and then I put their name.

00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:17.010
And they love that and it looks
great in their calendar.

00:26:17.010 --> 00:26:18.200
They know what's going on.

00:26:18.200 --> 00:26:20.430
It indicates whether you need
to be somewhere else or

00:26:20.430 --> 00:26:23.170
whether you don't need to be,
whether you need video or not.

00:26:23.170 --> 00:26:26.290
But the main thing is never
ever create a meeting.

00:26:26.290 --> 00:26:28.710
I would never email Trevor and
say meeting with Trevor

00:26:28.710 --> 00:26:31.880
because he has to then look into
the attendee list to find

00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.910
out who I am.

00:26:32.910 --> 00:26:34.270
And I had a meeting with
somebody the other day where

00:26:34.270 --> 00:26:36.710
they did that and their Gmail
address was instructively.

00:26:36.710 --> 00:26:39.160
I didn't even know
who they were.

00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.220
So that is my calendar tip.

00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:45.120
Always indicate what type of
meeting it is, put your name,

00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:49.010
if you need to, parentheses
Google, dash their name, if

00:26:49.010 --> 00:26:50.950
you need to, parentheses
their company.

00:26:50.950 --> 00:26:53.370
Good question.

00:26:53.370 --> 00:26:54.270
Frank?

00:26:54.270 --> 00:26:58.230
AUDIENCE: Like the gentleman
behind me, once you create

00:26:58.230 --> 00:27:01.660
that giant list, the anxiety of
that list, like every time

00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.710
I've done the full on GTD sort
of thing collecting that list,

00:27:05.710 --> 00:27:10.400
there's enough anxiety to it
that, one, is just going

00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.690
through it takes a lot of time
and taking out value from it.

00:27:14.690 --> 00:27:17.930
And then you start creating
these hack lists where this is

00:27:17.930 --> 00:27:20.280
the real list of the things I
want to get done and you start

00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:22.360
ignoring that thing
almost entirely.

00:27:22.360 --> 00:27:24.970
And so after a couple weeks,
that list is deprecated, it's

00:27:24.970 --> 00:27:27.990
no longer of value, and
so you've captured it.

00:27:27.990 --> 00:27:29.760
How have you dealt with that?

00:27:29.760 --> 00:27:32.720
Because that giant list,
especially at Google, that

00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:35.270
list can be pretty sizable.

00:27:35.270 --> 00:27:36.160
JARED GORALNICK:
It makes sense.

00:27:36.160 --> 00:27:37.775
So I know in GTD they
talk about context.

00:27:37.775 --> 00:27:39.530
They say you should have your
list for when you're in your

00:27:39.530 --> 00:27:41.100
car, or your home, or
different things.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:41.860
I don't do all of that.

00:27:41.860 --> 00:27:44.570
I just have a list of things
that I'm actually really going

00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:47.440
to do, or that I actually
have to do today.

00:27:47.440 --> 00:27:49.730
And then I have a list of things
that I need to do that

00:27:49.730 --> 00:27:51.380
I really do need to do.

00:27:51.380 --> 00:27:53.930
And then I just have this giant
list that someday maybe.

00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:57.140
And the soon list, I
look at every week.

00:27:57.140 --> 00:28:00.120
It's probably like
45, 50 items.

00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.860
The today list, I take
some things from it.

00:28:02.860 --> 00:28:04.660
And it doesn't mean that I
always get them done today.

00:28:04.660 --> 00:28:06.600
But it never gets to more
than like 10 items.

00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:09.720
I try to keep it more like
three or four items.

00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:12.790
So I have my things that
I really have to do.

00:28:12.790 --> 00:28:15.550
I have the things that I hope
to really do today.

00:28:15.550 --> 00:28:17.700
And then I have this giant
list that I might look at

00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:18.810
every month or so.

00:28:18.810 --> 00:28:22.560
And when I'm going through soon,
sometimes I move it to

00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:24.890
the forever, who knows,
whatever list,

00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:26.440
and sometimes I don't.

00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.060
I do have other lists, but
they're more lists of

00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:31.820
restaurants, or movies, or
people's names I don't want to

00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:32.780
forget, things like that.

00:28:32.780 --> 00:28:35.350
I try to keep those off of the
things that are actionable and

00:28:35.350 --> 00:28:36.660
that I have to really
pay attention to.

00:28:36.660 --> 00:28:38.020
Because those I actually will
go back to look at.

00:28:38.020 --> 00:28:39.910
You know, I walk into the coffee
house, I'm like, I know

00:28:39.910 --> 00:28:41.560
I know that person, I'm
going to look that up.

00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:44.340
Like that's me accessing
it that way.

00:28:44.340 --> 00:28:47.120
But I really try to keep the
actionable, necessary stuff.

00:28:47.120 --> 00:28:50.488
Those are the only things I
look at on a weekly basis.

00:28:50.488 --> 00:28:53.740
AUDIENCE: So what are your tips
for when you work with

00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:56.460
systems like GTD and
to-do lists?

00:28:56.460 --> 00:29:02.130
How do you not let it focus you
on the small tasks and do

00:29:02.130 --> 00:29:05.850
something bigger?

00:29:05.850 --> 00:29:07.490
JARED GORALNICK: Well, it
helps to know what your

00:29:07.490 --> 00:29:09.910
critical path is.

00:29:09.910 --> 00:29:11.130
What is one of the
most important

00:29:11.130 --> 00:29:11.980
things for your work?

00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:16.470
AUDIENCE: What I noticed, when
I really try and get into

00:29:16.470 --> 00:29:20.970
these productivity systems, they
take your attention away

00:29:20.970 --> 00:29:25.110
from the big picture and
onto these little

00:29:25.110 --> 00:29:26.600
chunks, little tasks.

00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:30.990
These little tasks are very
optimized to do efficiently

00:29:30.990 --> 00:29:33.150
and be productive
on that level.

00:29:33.150 --> 00:29:36.940
But at the end of the day, all
you have is a list of these

00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:40.350
small little tasks that you've
done and not your

00:29:40.350 --> 00:29:41.880
big project, maybe.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.950
So I wonder what your
suggestions are.

00:29:43.950 --> 00:29:47.350
How do you keep the focus on
the big picture while using

00:29:47.350 --> 00:29:47.930
those systems?

00:29:47.930 --> 00:29:48.930
JARED GORALNICK: So I
think there's two

00:29:48.930 --> 00:29:50.330
components to that.

00:29:50.330 --> 00:29:52.490
One component of it is the
fact that you have

00:29:52.490 --> 00:29:53.350
some sort of review.

00:29:53.350 --> 00:29:55.170
Like the evening before you
spend like literally two

00:29:55.170 --> 00:29:55.910
minutes and you're
like, what do I

00:29:55.910 --> 00:29:56.940
want to get done tomorrow?

00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.590
So you have some idea about what
is on the big project you

00:29:59.590 --> 00:30:00.790
want to do.

00:30:00.790 --> 00:30:03.670
And the second part of it is,
and this is where some people,

00:30:03.670 --> 00:30:06.390
I think, make the mistake of
when to use a calendar versus

00:30:06.390 --> 00:30:07.900
when to use a task.

00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:09.950
You shouldn't put all your
tasks in your calendar.

00:30:09.950 --> 00:30:11.690
You all know probably the basic
why you don't but your

00:30:11.690 --> 00:30:12.600
tasks in your calendar.

00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:14.470
It's because the next day, if
you didn't do it, it's now

00:30:14.470 --> 00:30:15.430
disappeared.

00:30:15.430 --> 00:30:17.020
But the task didn't disappear.

00:30:17.020 --> 00:30:19.170
So that's why you don't
just use your calendar

00:30:19.170 --> 00:30:19.770
for your task list.

00:30:19.770 --> 00:30:22.840
However, that's why I
was suggesting how I

00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:24.110
structure my day.

00:30:24.110 --> 00:30:26.690
So the thing that you really
need to do that's on your big

00:30:26.690 --> 00:30:28.490
list, you can use your
calendar for that.

00:30:28.490 --> 00:30:29.900
You can say, two hours.

00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:31.650
Or you can say like what I do,
I just know that it's my

00:30:31.650 --> 00:30:33.330
mornings is going
to be my really,

00:30:33.330 --> 00:30:34.510
really important stuff.

00:30:34.510 --> 00:30:37.410
So recognizing that when I look
for what I'm going to do

00:30:37.410 --> 00:30:39.400
tomorrow, something
really important

00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.120
has to happen tomorrow.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:43.810
And then, if necessary,
block that time out.

00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:45.570
Or if you just generally
understand how your schedule

00:30:45.570 --> 00:30:46.520
works, then don't.

00:30:46.520 --> 00:30:49.000
And then spend your time on
little to-do list stuff.

00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.080
The five minute things I like
to block all at once.

00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.930
You know, a bunch of phone
calls, and silly phone calls

00:30:53.930 --> 00:30:56.160
too, not even really important
work meeting phone calls.

00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:58.980
I try to batch those.

00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.450
I had a postcard the other
day I picked up.

00:31:00.450 --> 00:31:01.740
I should have brought it and put
it on this presentation.

00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:04.080
Something like, I can't do any
big things because I'm always

00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.800
spending time on the
little things.

00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:09.055
So you need to block out
those big things.

00:31:09.055 --> 00:31:11.660
You don't have to necessarily
put it in your calendar, but

00:31:11.660 --> 00:31:14.800
really just make sure that you
know every day when you're

00:31:14.800 --> 00:31:15.370
going to being do that.

00:31:15.370 --> 00:31:18.330
Because if you don't do that,
you're never going to feel

00:31:18.330 --> 00:31:19.780
like you accomplished
anything.

00:31:19.780 --> 00:31:21.270
And people say to do it
first thing in the

00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:22.050
morning if you can.

00:31:22.050 --> 00:31:23.850
I like doing that, some
people don't.

00:31:23.850 --> 00:31:26.430
But if you do the major, major
important stuff first thing,

00:31:26.430 --> 00:31:28.940
what's great about it is then
all the stuff that piled up

00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:32.480
from your inbox and the other
tasks you have to do, you can

00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:34.180
deal with them the rest of the
day, but at least you got

00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:37.220
something really major
done that morning.

00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:40.620
AUDIENCE: So what I've noticed
about new organizational

00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.800
systems, new management systems,
is that it's not so

00:31:42.800 --> 00:31:44.582
much the things that you already
know to do, it's the

00:31:44.582 --> 00:31:47.020
things that you don't know
that you have to do, the

00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:49.000
sudden interruption, the sudden
high priority thing

00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.260
that you did not accommodate
or plan for.

00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:54.940
Like you get sick or something
major happens and it blows

00:31:54.940 --> 00:31:56.690
apart your priorities.

00:31:56.690 --> 00:31:59.660
And therefore, once that
disruption happens, you can't

00:31:59.660 --> 00:32:02.960
recover back, so you sort
of just go on the

00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:03.550
way you used to.

00:32:03.550 --> 00:32:05.540
How do you handle that?

00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:07.040
JARED GORALNICK: Well, that's
the beauty of having a

00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.360
shorter task list.

00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.790
And what I mean by that is
like if you have that now

00:32:11.790 --> 00:32:15.150
list, then today when you get
sick or somebody comes in with

00:32:15.150 --> 00:32:17.190
a real emergency, yeah,
your day is screwed.

00:32:17.190 --> 00:32:19.760
Like I can't fix the problem
where you have seven hours

00:32:19.760 --> 00:32:21.140
worth of stuff to
do in four hours

00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.340
today, it can't be fixed.

00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.580
But if that next day, before
you start your day or

00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.070
whatever, you are going
to recalibrate and

00:32:29.070 --> 00:32:29.910
say, you know what?

00:32:29.910 --> 00:32:31.080
I'm just not going to be
able to do that thing.

00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:32.970
I'm even going to tell him
that I can't finish

00:32:32.970 --> 00:32:34.180
that thing on time.

00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:37.140
If you give yourself that
opportunity every day to set

00:32:37.140 --> 00:32:39.720
what your task list is for the
next day, then when you would

00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:44.690
get one of these catastrophic
things, you are able to just

00:32:44.690 --> 00:32:46.640
manipulate what you're doing
the next day as opposed to

00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:49.470
just having this list of 100
things and now you just never

00:32:49.470 --> 00:32:51.780
get to look at the other 99
because you just have one

00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:52.690
that's at the top.

00:32:52.690 --> 00:32:54.820
Now, this may sound like I'm
just saying I'm skirting

00:32:54.820 --> 00:32:55.830
around the problem.

00:32:55.830 --> 00:32:58.580
But I really think most of this
stuff is psychological.

00:32:58.580 --> 00:33:02.390
And what I mean by that is like
when crises happen, we

00:33:02.390 --> 00:33:04.320
always get through it.

00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:07.200
It's up to us, though, of
whether during that crisis we

00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:09.860
want to also feel overwhelmed
by every single time we look

00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:12.380
at the place, whether it be our
inbox or our task list,

00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.670
that sort of dictates how we
should be spending our time.

00:33:14.670 --> 00:33:17.060
If every time we look at that
we're also overwhelmed.

00:33:17.060 --> 00:33:21.030
So if you can respect yourself
enough to say that if I make

00:33:21.030 --> 00:33:23.990
it out of sight, out of mind,
I'm going to live with that,

00:33:23.990 --> 00:33:25.870
then you'll make some hard
decisions and move some things

00:33:25.870 --> 00:33:28.500
off your today list into
the soon list.

00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:30.900
And just accept that certain
things won't get done.

00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:34.310
But it's better to tell yourself
I'm not going to do

00:33:34.310 --> 00:33:38.500
this then to try to just pretend
that adding a bunch of

00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:40.750
crazy stuff into your list is
somehow going to happen.

00:33:40.750 --> 00:33:44.110
Because all you can do
with that is time.

00:33:44.110 --> 00:33:45.970
You have to say no
to some things.

00:33:45.970 --> 00:33:48.180
But I think the best way to say
no to that is every day to

00:33:48.180 --> 00:33:51.550
have a little bit of a conscious
decision about what

00:33:51.550 --> 00:33:54.480
you want to accomplish
that day or the next.

00:33:54.480 --> 00:33:57.570
AUDIENCE: So I have a question
regarding how to make this

00:33:57.570 --> 00:33:59.030
to-do list itself.

00:33:59.030 --> 00:34:01.725
So right now, my to-do lists are
kind of scattered over a

00:34:01.725 --> 00:34:04.930
few things, like I have a few
labels on the emails like to

00:34:04.930 --> 00:34:06.260
do or something.

00:34:06.260 --> 00:34:08.880
And I have like a bug list,
which me and my peers and my

00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:11.760
manager keep filling, and
that's my to-do list.

00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:14.825
And then I have like a to-do
list, like a special list

00:34:14.825 --> 00:34:16.199
which I make.

00:34:16.199 --> 00:34:18.830
So my question is, how do you
make this to-do list?

00:34:18.830 --> 00:34:21.449
Because if I start making one
giant to-do list, basically

00:34:21.449 --> 00:34:25.449
I'll be scraping the emails
again and again to put into

00:34:25.449 --> 00:34:28.830
this list, whereas it's easier
to just keep the labels.

00:34:28.830 --> 00:34:29.829
Same with bugs.

00:34:29.829 --> 00:34:32.880
Like if I want to keep just one
list, I'll have to keep

00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.989
scraping the bugs and then
like note down the minute

00:34:36.989 --> 00:34:38.420
details of that in
my to-do list.

00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:41.020
So I'm kind of recreating
some of the bug, which

00:34:41.020 --> 00:34:42.100
is easier to do.

00:34:42.100 --> 00:34:45.310
But at the same time, I do get
distracted with the emails

00:34:45.310 --> 00:34:46.710
that pop up.

00:34:46.710 --> 00:34:50.264
So my question is, how do you
deal with making this to-do

00:34:50.264 --> 00:34:53.469
list itself efficiently
without having to

00:34:53.469 --> 00:34:55.340
redo a lot of work?

00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:56.080
JARED GORALNICK: Sure.

00:34:56.080 --> 00:34:59.450
So everybody here probably
knows you have the Add To

00:34:59.450 --> 00:35:03.860
Tasks List menu option, and you
also have the shortcut for

00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:06.730
it, to take an email and
turn it into a task.

00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:09.020
So that's what I do as just
a starting point.

00:35:09.020 --> 00:35:11.590
And just about every project
management tool will notify

00:35:11.590 --> 00:35:12.470
you via email.

00:35:12.470 --> 00:35:14.960
So for me, I'm not wasting
that many steps to turn

00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:19.260
something from an email or
something from some other

00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:23.260
project management tool
into now a task.

00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:27.850
But that being said, you have
to ask yourself, are you

00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:30.910
comfortable with having multiple
things to check?

00:35:30.910 --> 00:35:33.100
So for me, for example, I know
I'm going to check my calendar

00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.280
a bunch of times a day.

00:35:34.280 --> 00:35:36.080
I know I'm going to look
at my today list a

00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:37.160
bunch of times today.

00:35:37.160 --> 00:35:39.300
And I'm probably going to
look at my soon list at

00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:41.430
least once every day.

00:35:41.430 --> 00:35:43.210
Beyond that, I mean I know
I'm going to check

00:35:43.210 --> 00:35:44.280
my Facebook or something.

00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:47.030
But beyond that, it's hard for
me to trust myself that I'm

00:35:47.030 --> 00:35:48.530
going to go to those
other places.

00:35:48.530 --> 00:35:51.730
If you can get yourself to do
that, then by all means have

00:35:51.730 --> 00:35:53.680
multiple lists.

00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.330
If you can't, then you do have
to put it in one place.

00:35:56.330 --> 00:35:58.280
But that's a learning thing.

00:35:58.280 --> 00:36:00.530
Can you get yourself to have
four, or five, or six?

00:36:00.530 --> 00:36:01.440
And you might be.

00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:04.120
I mean, there's lots of people
that everything comes from

00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.570
their ticketing tracking
system.

00:36:05.570 --> 00:36:07.260
And they spend so much time
there that they don't need it

00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.360
to be in their box too.

00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.310
Like on my team, most of my team
does use the ticketing

00:36:11.310 --> 00:36:12.880
tracking system as their
dominant place.

00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:15.590
Me personally, I'm doing
less of that.

00:36:15.590 --> 00:36:19.470
So I rely more on my
primary task list.

00:36:19.470 --> 00:36:21.870
AUDIENCE: So do you scrape the
emails to create the task as

00:36:21.870 --> 00:36:24.780
they come or do you dedicate
a certain time for it?

00:36:24.780 --> 00:36:27.290
Like would you say, OK, in the
mornings I won't check, but in

00:36:27.290 --> 00:36:30.070
the afternoon I'll dedicate
like 45 minutes to create

00:36:30.070 --> 00:36:32.890
tasks out of them
or something?

00:36:32.890 --> 00:36:36.110
JARED GORALNICK: So creating
tasks, it's not as hard an

00:36:36.110 --> 00:36:40.430
effort as it sounds in the sense
that I'm literally task

00:36:40.430 --> 00:36:41.090
and archive.

00:36:41.090 --> 00:36:41.740
That's it.

00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.760
And then I give it a different
title if I need to.

00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:45.440
That's when you say
"creating t--"

00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.670
Now, of course, how I process
my email, I try not to do it

00:36:47.670 --> 00:36:48.520
in the morning.

00:36:48.520 --> 00:36:51.330
And then usually, before lunch,
around 11:30 or so,

00:36:51.330 --> 00:36:55.210
I'll spend some time on my task
list, or rather on my

00:36:55.210 --> 00:36:56.360
inbox processing.

00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.630
Some things I immediately reply
to, some things I put on

00:36:58.630 --> 00:37:00.350
the task list, other things
I just archive

00:37:00.350 --> 00:37:01.920
or delete, et cetera.

00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:05.150
Straight out of your inbox zero
technique, if you will.

00:37:05.150 --> 00:37:06.950
But what's important, though,
is I'm just saying that that

00:37:06.950 --> 00:37:10.400
transition from email
notification into task is a

00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:11.250
very quick effort.

00:37:11.250 --> 00:37:12.994
We're talking a couple
seconds.

00:37:12.994 --> 00:37:14.890
AUDIENCE: It's still
distracting though.

00:37:14.890 --> 00:37:17.660
JARED GORALNICK: Well, but
here's the thing, though, once

00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:20.440
it's in the task list, I feel
like I have control over it.

00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:23.440
The thing with the email
is you don't have any

00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:23.870
control over it.

00:37:23.870 --> 00:37:26.050
You can't rename it, you
can't reorder it.

00:37:26.050 --> 00:37:29.150
So once it's in my task list,
it might start staring me

00:37:29.150 --> 00:37:32.560
down, but at least I can move
it, at least I can rename it,

00:37:32.560 --> 00:37:35.040
at least I can prioritize it in
some way, in some way that

00:37:35.040 --> 00:37:36.200
I have control over.

00:37:36.200 --> 00:37:40.470
And really, I think all
of productivity, in a

00:37:40.470 --> 00:37:42.680
collaborative environment, all
of it is, how can I be

00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:47.170
responsive without constantly
being reactive?

00:37:47.170 --> 00:37:49.730
So getting back to people in
three hours, that's fine,

00:37:49.730 --> 00:37:51.400
that's responsive.

00:37:51.400 --> 00:37:54.580
Getting back to people in five
minutes, that's unsustainable.

00:37:54.580 --> 00:37:57.090
That's creating an expectation
that they're more

00:37:57.090 --> 00:37:58.980
important than you.

00:37:58.980 --> 00:38:00.950
Our product helps with making
sure that people you do need

00:38:00.950 --> 00:38:02.530
to get back to right
away, you can.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:05.990
But generally speaking, most
things don't demand your time

00:38:05.990 --> 00:38:07.360
right right now.

00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:10.440
So anything you can do to set
that expectation I think is a

00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:11.070
good thing.

00:38:11.070 --> 00:38:14.490
And I think moving it to your
task list is a much better

00:38:14.490 --> 00:38:16.050
place than leaving
it in your inbox.

00:38:16.050 --> 00:38:16.680
AUDIENCE: Pretty awesome.

00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:20.020
I just stumbled by, and thanks
for coming to us to speak.

00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.586
This is a point, you're almost
talking about how you manage

00:38:22.586 --> 00:38:25.065
the big projects versus like
the day-to-day tasks.

00:38:25.065 --> 00:38:28.145
I believe there's some function
in between which

00:38:28.145 --> 00:38:30.492
daily translates the big
projects and the concrete

00:38:30.492 --> 00:38:32.345
steps and turns them into
your daily tasks.

00:38:32.345 --> 00:38:34.945
Like what's the right system or
I guess what have you found

00:38:34.945 --> 00:38:35.550
that really works for you?

00:38:35.550 --> 00:38:38.750
Because personally, I understand
the email and

00:38:38.750 --> 00:38:40.990
translating it to like daily
tasks, but it's that project

00:38:40.990 --> 00:38:43.020
part that's even harder.

00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.830
JARED GORALNICK: I mean this is
where there's two different

00:38:44.830 --> 00:38:45.380
approaches.

00:38:45.380 --> 00:38:48.980
There's David Allen would say
put the absolute next step on

00:38:48.980 --> 00:38:50.630
your task list, this way
there's no barrier.

00:38:50.630 --> 00:38:54.160
So for example, if you have to
call somebody, and it's just

00:38:54.160 --> 00:38:55.120
call Steve.

00:38:55.120 --> 00:38:57.080
Well, now you have to look up
Steve's number, and you have

00:38:57.080 --> 00:38:59.800
to look up whatever the ticket
number it relates to is, and

00:38:59.800 --> 00:39:00.580
all this other stuff.

00:39:00.580 --> 00:39:02.030
And then you're not going
to do it, right?

00:39:02.030 --> 00:39:04.820
So there is something to be said
for making sure that if

00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.320
you put it in your task list it
relates to a big project,

00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:09.240
get it there so there's
no barriers for you

00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:12.180
starting with it, right?

00:39:12.180 --> 00:39:14.380
If it's something that you need
to spend an hour on as

00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:17.290
opposed to something really
discrete, really specific,

00:39:17.290 --> 00:39:19.340
that's where, again, the
calendar can come in and help

00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.200
a little bit.

00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:26.160
Or if you trust yourself enough,
in other words, like

00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:27.750
to the extent that you have
something bigger to

00:39:27.750 --> 00:39:29.310
accomplish, describe
it that way for

00:39:29.310 --> 00:39:30.620
yourself in the task list.

00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:33.760
If you need to check in a
particular fix and that's

00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:35.770
going to take 45 minutes, just
put that in your task list.

00:39:35.770 --> 00:39:37.940
If you really need to block out
the time, then put it in

00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:39.730
your calendar.

00:39:39.730 --> 00:39:41.840
Unfortunately, all I can do
is help people to remove

00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:44.310
barriers, which means gathering
all the information

00:39:44.310 --> 00:39:46.840
you possibly can, so that when
you see it in your task list

00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.450
you don't just go
away from it.

00:39:50.450 --> 00:39:52.890
And I definitely don't want you
to have to create like 600

00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:55.290
tasks that you're always going
to do them in a row.

00:39:55.290 --> 00:39:58.290
In other words, if two things
have to happen in a row, and

00:39:58.290 --> 00:40:00.100
always have to happen in a row,
you shouldn't make them

00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.700
two tasks, per se, unless you're
just saving yourself

00:40:02.700 --> 00:40:04.940
time by doing it that way.

00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.610
But the real thing is just
figuring out for yourself what

00:40:07.610 --> 00:40:11.990
removes barriers and what
provides clarity for you.

00:40:11.990 --> 00:40:14.015
Again, all this stuff, getting
off the hamster wheel, is so

00:40:14.015 --> 00:40:16.110
that you have enough time to
have clarity, whether it be in

00:40:16.110 --> 00:40:18.830
reprioritizing or deciding
what's going to make the most

00:40:18.830 --> 00:40:20.896
impact for you.

00:40:20.896 --> 00:40:23.740
AUDIENCE: As you're going
specifically from email to a

00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.780
task list, if you're getting
emails which are long, and

00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:29.100
complex, and four paragraphs,
and have links off to other

00:40:29.100 --> 00:40:32.370
things, and it's not entirely
clear what the point is, as

00:40:32.370 --> 00:40:35.020
you're going from the email to
the task list, do you take the

00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:38.320
time to read the email, think
about what the tasks are, and

00:40:38.320 --> 00:40:39.890
then put those on
the task list?

00:40:39.890 --> 00:40:42.160
Or do you kind of have something
where it's like

00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:46.350
you're dumping like deal with
this email on the task list?

00:40:46.350 --> 00:40:47.050
Does that make sense?

00:40:47.050 --> 00:40:49.250
JARED GORALNICK: In a perfect
world, I'll take out the bits

00:40:49.250 --> 00:40:50.990
that are actionable.

00:40:50.990 --> 00:40:53.120
In reality, sometimes I'm just
trying to get this stuff off

00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.040
of my plate.

00:40:54.040 --> 00:40:56.600
So it really depends on how
much time you have.

00:40:56.600 --> 00:41:01.640
If you can break it into
discrete things, it's better.

00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:04.130
What's great, though, is that
you preserve the URL.

00:41:04.130 --> 00:41:07.680
I want the Tasks team here to
fix the ability to move tasks

00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:11.620
on a mobile device between task
lists without losing the

00:41:11.620 --> 00:41:12.950
URL linking to emails.

00:41:12.950 --> 00:41:14.740
Right now it breaks if
you move from one

00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.880
task list to another.

00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.390
It breaks the URL if you do it
on a mobile device or anything

00:41:18.390 --> 00:41:18.950
with the API.

00:41:18.950 --> 00:41:20.970
I would love that fix
to be in place.

00:41:20.970 --> 00:41:24.770
But again, as long as you have
the URL, that at least is your

00:41:24.770 --> 00:41:25.640
get out of jail free card.

00:41:25.640 --> 00:41:27.860
You just want to know enough
in the email that you don't

00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:29.140
have to deal with
this right now.

00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:31.220
And as long as you've eliminated
that, it's OK to

00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.445
process it later.

00:41:32.445 --> 00:41:34.920
AUDIENCE: Actually, a lot of us
spend quite a bit of time

00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:35.660
in meetings as well.

00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:38.260
And I'm wondering if you have
any general thoughts on how to

00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:41.930
make meetings most efficient
as well.

00:41:41.930 --> 00:41:43.740
JARED GORALNICK: There's
a lot to that.

00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:45.910
It's like everything in life,
the more you prepare, the

00:41:45.910 --> 00:41:47.260
better it is when you show up.

00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:50.220
And a lot of people use meetings
to just like be a

00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.390
handholding to start
accomplishing things when the

00:41:52.390 --> 00:41:55.390
reality is you should be going
there to report or discuss the

00:41:55.390 --> 00:41:58.370
things that really do
need deliberation.

00:41:58.370 --> 00:42:01.030
I guess one tip I'll just
throw out is just when

00:42:01.030 --> 00:42:04.960
brainstorming sometimes the best
way to do it is to not do

00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.590
it out loud, but to write.

00:42:06.590 --> 00:42:08.280
Because as soon as you start
doing it out loud, the

00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:10.510
conversation and the thoughts
go in that direction.

00:42:10.510 --> 00:42:12.700
Whereas if you spend five
minutes and you just list out

00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:15.500
the things that you want to
then bring up, or you have

00:42:15.500 --> 00:42:17.180
people do this before the
meeting, but sometimes it's

00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:19.150
easier to do it in a meeting.

00:42:19.150 --> 00:42:21.960
If you have them all write it
out while silent and then put

00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:24.360
it on the white board, or with
the sticky notes, or whatever,

00:42:24.360 --> 00:42:25.610
you're going to find that you're
going to have a lot

00:42:25.610 --> 00:42:27.030
more variety of ideas.

00:42:27.030 --> 00:42:29.080
And that the people who tend
to be quieter, and I'm sure

00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:32.150
there's people here in Google
that are very outspoken and

00:42:32.150 --> 00:42:34.440
people that are quiet and
sometimes the most brilliant

00:42:34.440 --> 00:42:36.720
folks, that will not
overshadow them.

00:42:36.720 --> 00:42:38.650
So that's just one technique
for meetings.

00:42:38.650 --> 00:42:39.760
I hope it helps.

00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.350
But yeah, there's so many
different things that one can

00:42:42.350 --> 00:42:43.010
do with meetings.

00:42:43.010 --> 00:42:45.870
But stick to the agenda, respect
people's time, show up

00:42:45.870 --> 00:42:49.530
on time, and just try to not
make it so the people that

00:42:49.530 --> 00:42:52.370
overpower meetings overpower
meetings.

00:42:52.370 --> 00:42:55.120
So thank you guys so much for
your time, I'll be sticking

00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:55.770
around here.

00:42:55.770 --> 00:42:57.180
And this is how to
get in touch.

00:42:57.180 --> 00:42:57.950
I appreciate it.

00:42:57.950 --> 00:42:58.550
Thanks.

00:42:58.550 --> 00:43:02.512
[APPLAUSE]
