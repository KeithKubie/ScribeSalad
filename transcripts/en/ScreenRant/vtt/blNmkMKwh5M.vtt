00:00:07.879 --> 00:00:12.280
When it comes to movies, the only thing most
people can agree on is that film is subjective.

00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:17.550
No matter how acclaimed or criticized a movie
is, different people are going to see it differently.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.609
Even then, most projects will have a general
consensus that defines them as �good�

00:00:21.609 --> 00:00:26.070
or �bad.� But what about the films that
come out and divide opinions, inspiring heated

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:34.200
debates that rage on for years? Here are Screen
Rant�s 10 Most Polarizing Popular Movies.

00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:37.550
Citizen Kane
Widely considered to be �the greatest film

00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:42.220
ever made,� Orson Welles� opus pushed
the art of moviemaking in exciting new directions,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:46.980
with aspects like shot composition and lighting
adding layers to its powerful �rise and

00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:51.760
fall� narrative. It�s used in film classes
even today to illustrate how to tell an interesting

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.620
story through visuals.
But even this legendary film wasn�t without

00:00:55.620 --> 00:01:00.110
controversy. Welles based his portrayal of
Charles Foster Kane on media mogul William

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:05.189
Randolph Hearst. Members of Heart�s camp
saw the film as an attack and began a smear

00:01:05.189 --> 00:01:09.630
campaign to disgrace Welles� name. Before
the film was shown in theatres, the filmmaker

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:13.850
had to make cuts approved by Hearst�s lawyers
to avoid further offence.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.140
2001: A Space Odyssey
An influential sci-fi epic, Stanley Kubrick�s

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:24.200
film pushed the boundaries of special effects
technology, while attempting to tackle heady

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:29.299
ideas about the history and future of mankind.
The movie�s supporters credit its visual

00:01:29.299 --> 00:01:33.740
poetry, memorable soundtrack, and Kubrick�s
ambitious vision, which worked together to

00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:38.409
create a unique experience.
Despite its �classic� ranking today, 2001

00:01:38.409 --> 00:01:43.479
garnered many negative reviews upon its initial
release. Detractors argued that its slow pacing

00:01:43.479 --> 00:01:47.789
made it a boring watch, and that the story
was too abstract to establish a strong connection

00:01:47.789 --> 00:01:52.009
with viewers. And what was up with that baby
at the end? We�re still trying to figure

00:01:52.009 --> 00:01:54.779
it out.

00:01:54.779 --> 00:01:57.639
Kids
With a narrative that focused on a group of

00:01:57.639 --> 00:02:02.040
sexually active teens abusing drugs and alcohol
in New York during the AIDS epidemic in the

00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:06.440
�90s, it�s no wonder Kids generated as
much controversy as it did. Critics state

00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:10.509
that the film is exploitive and operates more
as child pornography than a coming-of-age

00:02:10.509 --> 00:02:15.260
tale, factors which led to it receiving the
rare NC-17 rating.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.190
Still, some feel that the film delivers a
powerful message that�s worth listening

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:23.580
too. Director Larry Clark shot the project
as a quasi-documentary, giving it a sense

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:28.390
of raw, honest realism that made it impossible
to not look at Kids as a wakeup call that

00:02:28.390 --> 00:02:31.500
modern society so desperately needed.

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:35.170
Eyes Wide Shut
Kubrick always found a way to split opinions,

00:02:35.170 --> 00:02:39.300
and his last film is no different. Fans of
Eyes Wide Shut view the erotic thriller as

00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:43.890
a compelling study of the human psyche. Many
praised the brave performances of then-real-life

00:02:43.890 --> 00:02:48.130
married couple Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman,
which were considered risky due to their stature

00:02:48.130 --> 00:02:49.940
as industry A-listers.
Critics of the film believe that it suffered

00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:51.110
from the same shortcomings of other Kubrick
movies, namely that the main story is too

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:52.110
abstract and complex to make sense of, even
when you�re paying attention. Surprisingly,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:54.800
Kubrick�s filmmaking techniques also drew
much ire, as he chose to film New York City

00:02:54.800 --> 00:03:00.730
scenes in a studio, which limited the scope
of those sequences.

00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.270
Napoleon Dynamite
This indie comedy acquired a large cult following

00:03:05.270 --> 00:03:09.920
due to its quirky sense of humor and collection
of oddball characters that gave socially awkward

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:15.590
geeks a new group of heroes to identify with.
In particular, star Jon Heder earned rave

00:03:15.590 --> 00:03:19.320
reviews, with his deadpan delivery becoming
a quick favorite among fans.

00:03:19.320 --> 00:03:24.420
But that weird charm alienated a wide range
of moviegoers, many of whom felt that its

00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:29.390
�comedy� was nothing more than unfunny
stupidity. Accused of being hipster self-indulgence

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:34.481
the anti-Dynamite crowd believe that Napoleon
himself is an unlikable protagonist and the

00:03:34.481 --> 00:03:38.290
situations aren�t all that comedic, making
it hard to see what we were supposed to be

00:03:38.290 --> 00:03:40.380
laughing at.

00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:45.550
The Fountain
Director Darren Aronofsky is always trying

00:03:45.550 --> 00:03:49.290
to do something interesting with his films,
and The Fountain represents one of his most

00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:54.750
bold efforts yet. Diving into heavy subjects
like metaphysics and religious faith, the

00:03:54.750 --> 00:03:58.790
film was visually stunning and gave cinephiles
something to appreciate by standing out from

00:03:58.790 --> 00:04:01.580
the crowd.
Still, others thought that Aronofsky�s vision

00:04:01.580 --> 00:04:06.670
was too broad for this film, which barely
ran over 90 minutes. The multi-narrative style

00:04:06.670 --> 00:04:11.360
of the plot was highly criticized, since the
many transitions between time periods prevented

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:15.440
the director from thoroughly developing the
character and thematic arcs, elements that

00:04:15.440 --> 00:04:20.509
are necessary to make a work with these ambitions
truly compelling.

00:04:20.509 --> 00:04:24.500
Quantum of Solace
Daniel Craig�s second outing as James Bond

00:04:24.500 --> 00:04:31.050
was seen as a monumental disappointment following
the acclaimed franchise reboot Casino Royale.

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:35.450
Critics stated that the quick-cut, Bourne-style
editing made the action difficult to follow,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:40.270
and longtime fans took issue with the darker
portrayal of 007, saying it stripped the character

00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:45.600
of what made him memorable. Not to mention,
Dominic Greene wasn�t a great villain.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.630
But in the years since its release, Quantum
has acquired a segment of supporters who say

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:54.310
it�s an underrated Bond film. Craig�s
performance was praised, as the actor further

00:04:54.310 --> 00:04:59.200
put his stamp on the iconic spy by combing
suave sophistication with rugged toughness.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:03.730
The depiction of Bond hell-bent on revenge
also made for an interesting watch against

00:05:03.730 --> 00:05:07.300
the backdrop of a timely, politically charged
plot

00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:10.790
Avatar
The highest-grossing film of all time, James

00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.590
Cameron�s Oscar-nominated blockbuster drew
comparisons to Star Wars after it was released.

00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.320
The director once again revolutionized film
technology with lush, photorealistic digital

00:05:20.320 --> 00:05:25.210
characters and environments. Pandora was an
immersive, gorgeous world that we all wanted

00:05:25.210 --> 00:05:27.580
to visit, and the action was thrilling as
well.

00:05:27.580 --> 00:05:32.810
That said, the film didn�t suck everyone
in. Many cried foul at Avatar�s story, which

00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:36.830
was seen as derivative of other films and
was told through one-dimensional characters

00:05:36.830 --> 00:05:41.580
that were a far cry from what Cameron had
delivered before. Also, that heavy-handed

00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.580
anti-corporate, anti-technology message? A
little hypocritical, no?

00:05:46.580 --> 00:05:50.490
Man of Steel
The building block of the long-anticipated

00:05:50.490 --> 00:05:54.780
DC cinematic universe, Man of Steel didn�t
draw the same kind of reception Marvel�s

00:05:54.780 --> 00:05:59.280
Iron Man enjoyed. Zack Snyder�s grounded
and realistic approach to telling the story

00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:03.690
was accused of making Superman too dark and
brooding (a stark contrast from Christopher

00:06:03.690 --> 00:06:08.120
Reeve). The destructive climax also led to
many claiming that the character of Kal-El

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.100
had been ruined beyond repair.
But, the film has an equal amount of supporters

00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:15.990
who state that its portrayal of Clark Kent
made him more relatable and believable than

00:06:15.990 --> 00:06:21.770
previous incarnations, giving outcasts someone
to look up to. This segment also feels that

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:26.580
the action, while at times too much, made
the film cinematic and unlike anything we�d

00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.919
seen in the genre before.

00:06:29.919 --> 00:06:32.830
Lucy
Luc Besson once again delivered a slick and

00:06:32.830 --> 00:06:37.820
entertaining genre piece with this Scarlett
Johansson vehicle. The action sequences were

00:06:37.820 --> 00:06:42.540
handled with stylistic flourishes that only
the filmmaker could present, and the fun was

00:06:42.540 --> 00:06:47.160
even complimented by some interesting studies
of human intelligence and philosophical ideas.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:50.490
At least, that�s what its supporters will
tell you.

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:54.990
Lucy also drew heavy amounts of criticism,
with its reliance on the disproven �10 percent

00:06:54.990 --> 00:06:59.800
brain capacity� theory making it hard for
some to take it seriously. Also, the action

00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:04.770
was devoid of much tension. The Lucy character
simply became more and more of an unstoppable

00:07:04.770 --> 00:07:08.830
killing machine that no one could pose a threat
to as she became more advanced.

00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:12.270
Conclusion
