00:00:00.367 --> 00:00:19.033
â™ª [Slow, orchestral music playing]

00:00:19.033 --> 00:00:21.166
Cliff: All right. Well, good afternoon,
everyone.

00:00:21.166 --> 00:00:24.400
We'd like to welcome you to
another Musicians@Google event.

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.967
I wanted to start off with a little
bit of bad news on this April 1st.

00:00:28.967 --> 00:00:31.734
I know we have a lot of things
going on today

00:00:31.734 --> 00:00:33.500
as you can see on the Google
home page

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.934
but I just did receive word
that the composer is dead.

00:00:35.934 --> 00:00:40.467
So this might turn into a CSI@Google
instead of a Musicians@Google

00:00:40.467 --> 00:00:41.900
but that's okay.

00:00:41.900 --> 00:00:45.834
I'd like to introduce you to some of our
friends from the San Francisco Symphony.

00:00:45.834 --> 00:00:49.233
In partnership with them we bring
you this presentation today

00:00:49.233 --> 00:00:53.700
and it's really cool to see all of our young
and future Googlers in the audience as well.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:56.500
So we hope you enjoy the speech.

00:00:56.500 --> 00:01:00.367
It will primarily focus in our
discussion on music education

00:01:00.367 --> 00:01:03.367
and young people's participation
in the symphony

00:01:03.367 --> 00:01:05.867
which actually brings back a lot
of memories for me, as well.

00:01:05.867 --> 00:01:07.300
I remember growing up

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.433
I was almost afraid of the performing
arts at the Crenet Center.

00:01:10.433 --> 00:01:14.133
There was actually some unfortunate
incidents involving red balloons

00:01:14.133 --> 00:01:16.367
and then I saw "Peter and the Wolf",
and I just --

00:01:16.367 --> 00:01:19.200
I still feel sad about what
happened to the duck to this very day.

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:21.367
I think they get a very bad rap.

00:01:21.367 --> 00:01:23.967
But fortunately the oboes
have a much happier fate

00:01:23.967 --> 00:01:27.500
in this more recent book by Mr. Snicket.

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:30.900
So it's with great anticipation
that we bring this new book,

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:33.734
which, as you heard, is entitled
"The Composer is Dead",

00:01:33.734 --> 00:01:37.033
that you learn a lot of the hidden back
story about what really happens

00:01:37.033 --> 00:01:39.000
behind a symphony orchestra

00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.700
and one thing I also noticed while
reading the book over the weekend

00:01:42.700 --> 00:01:46.800
is that the violas do get off really,
really easily.

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.734
If you played in orchestra
you know what I mean.

00:01:49.734 --> 00:01:52.533
So some minor things to
note for our curtain call.

00:01:52.533 --> 00:01:54.266
A little bit of housekeeping.

00:01:54.266 --> 00:01:56.166
Please use the mic for questions
and answers.

00:01:56.166 --> 00:01:59.033
We'll actually have time for
some Q and A towards the end.

00:01:59.033 --> 00:02:03.333
We also are streaming this live to
Googler's desktops worldwide

00:02:03.333 --> 00:02:06.934
so be sure to speak into the mic
so they can hear your questions.

00:02:06.934 --> 00:02:10.500
Also we are premiering
an interactive element

00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.500
so if you all could go to
go/snicket at your leisure

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:17.333
that's also the place where you
can post some questions,

00:02:17.333 --> 00:02:19.567
answer some of the survey elements

00:02:19.567 --> 00:02:22.367
we're gonna introduce
into our talk today.

00:02:22.367 --> 00:02:25.467
And just remember one thing
as you're reading the survey:

00:02:25.467 --> 00:02:28.033
No one ever suspects the sousaphones.

00:02:28.033 --> 00:02:30.500
So I'm very pleased to introduce
Ron Gallman,

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:32.200
who will tell us more about
today's program.

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:38.700
Thank you.
[Applause]

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.600
Ron: Thank you so much, Cliff,

00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.867
and thanks to the entire
Google community

00:02:45.867 --> 00:02:48.633
for hosting the San Francisco
Symphony again.

00:02:48.633 --> 00:02:50.000
We're thrilled to be here.

00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.367
I'd like to send a special shoutout
hello to all the kids out there.

00:02:54.367 --> 00:02:56.600
Hi, guys.

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.700
The San Francisco Symphony is
very much committed to providing

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:04.066
programming of the highest quality,

00:03:04.066 --> 00:03:09.200
of course, for adults through our program
-- through our subscription concerts

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:15.333
but also of course to children
through education programming.

00:03:15.333 --> 00:03:20.266
We do that over the entire Bay
Area but here in the South Bay,

00:03:20.266 --> 00:03:26.367
we present a special series of concerts
at Flint Center in Cupertino

00:03:26.367 --> 00:03:29.734
and through the series of concerts
at the Flint center in Cupertino,

00:03:29.734 --> 00:03:33.233
we're very, very much
committed to providing

00:03:33.233 --> 00:03:37.266
the highest quality programming
both artistic and educationally

00:03:37.266 --> 00:03:40.834
to our South Bay communities.

00:03:40.834 --> 00:03:45.500
Google employees you should know
that you get a 50 percent off of --

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:48.300
of the price of those concerts at Flint.

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:51.734
There's more information about
that on the fliers that you have.

00:03:51.734 --> 00:03:57.266
Well, today's program is a sneak peak
at one of the education concerts

00:03:57.266 --> 00:03:58.667
that's coming up at Flint.

00:03:58.667 --> 00:04:04.100
It's one of our music for families
concerts that takes place on April 4th,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:07.033
that's this Saturday, 3:00 o'clock.

00:04:07.033 --> 00:04:11.567
This is a program that is called
"The Composer is Dead".

00:04:11.567 --> 00:04:18.100
It's a program that is based
on this wonderful,

00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:22.633
wonderful original text
by Lemony Snicket,

00:04:22.633 --> 00:04:27.233
incredible music by the composer
Nathaniel Stookey,

00:04:27.233 --> 00:04:29.934
who's had a long history with
the San Francisco Symphony,

00:04:29.934 --> 00:04:32.934
maybe Nathaniel will tell
us about that in a bit.

00:04:32.934 --> 00:04:36.734
Nathaniel with a member of the San
Francisco Symphony Youth Orchestra

00:04:36.734 --> 00:04:39.133
in his teens.

00:04:39.133 --> 00:04:42.734
This performance of the words
and music

00:04:42.734 --> 00:04:46.367
was commissioned by
the San Francisco Symphony.

00:04:46.367 --> 00:04:51.266
The premier performances were
conducted by conductor Edwin Outwater,

00:04:51.266 --> 00:04:57.900
and this mighty triumvirate is back
for us now to reprise that performance,

00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:02.900
but on a very special occasion now that
HarperCollins has issued the book

00:05:02.900 --> 00:05:07.834
"The Composer is Dead" along
with the CD with the music,

00:05:07.834 --> 00:05:10.300
Lemony Snicket narrating,

00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:13.567
Edwin Outwater conducting
the San Francisco Symphony.

00:05:13.567 --> 00:05:16.467
So, this is a very special occasion for us

00:05:16.467 --> 00:05:19.400
and we think it'll be a very special
occasion for all of you

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.200
Lemony Snicket fans out there.

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:24.233
I said this was a family concert.

00:05:24.233 --> 00:05:27.266
The San Francisco Symphony
does a series of family concerts

00:05:27.266 --> 00:05:30.300
both at Flint Center in Cupertino
and, also of course,

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:32.900
at Davies Symphony Hall
in San Francisco.

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:39.667
We do that because, uh,
presenting music to all ages,

00:05:39.667 --> 00:05:41.834
to all constituencies,

00:05:41.834 --> 00:05:46.834
is a part of what we do and what we
are as the San Francisco Symphony.

00:05:46.834 --> 00:05:48.633
As the San Francisco Symphony,
of course,

00:05:48.633 --> 00:05:54.200
we present concerts for adult audiences
at the highest levels of artistry

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:58.967
and at the same time we produce
education concerts,

00:05:58.967 --> 00:06:05.233
concerts that engage young people,
families, parents, grandparents,

00:06:05.233 --> 00:06:07.200
people of all ages.

00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:10.200
And so you will see an example of that

00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:14.033
at the music for families concert
on April 4th.

00:06:14.033 --> 00:06:16.066
Well, without further ado,

00:06:16.066 --> 00:06:21.567
I would like to introduce the group that
I refer to as our mighty triumvirate

00:06:21.567 --> 00:06:26.500
and ask them to make their way up
to the magic chairs up front.

00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:30.166
And so let's begin with, umm --

00:06:30.166 --> 00:06:34.367
and, well, this is -- it is April Fool's day
but this is not an April Fool's,

00:06:34.367 --> 00:06:35.767
I have to warn you.

00:06:35.767 --> 00:06:41.433
Lemony Snicket, the very famous author,
as you know, umm, is very shy,

00:06:41.433 --> 00:06:44.033
uh, is -- is prone to no-shows,

00:06:44.033 --> 00:06:50.667
but we're all accustomed to that because
Mr. Snicket is almost always represented

00:06:50.667 --> 00:06:53.000
by Mr. Daniel Handler,

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.633
the official representative.

00:06:55.633 --> 00:06:59.834
[Applause]

00:06:59.834 --> 00:07:03.400
Ron: The official representative
for Mr. Snicket in all matters,

00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:06.133
umm, literary --

00:07:06.133 --> 00:07:09.233
literary, matters of law,
and socially.

00:07:09.233 --> 00:07:15.300
So we also have a live composer.

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:16.600
This is what they look like.

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.667
[Laughing]

00:07:18.667 --> 00:07:22.033
Ron: Hello to Daniel Stookey,
our composer.

00:07:22.033 --> 00:07:24.767
I report, Nathaniel Stookey,
our composer. For --

00:07:24.767 --> 00:07:26.433
[laughing]

00:07:26.433 --> 00:07:28.967
Ron: -- "The Composer is Dead".

00:07:28.967 --> 00:07:31.133
And, of course,

00:07:31.133 --> 00:07:31.900
any orchestra,

00:07:31.900 --> 00:07:33.533
any orchestral work,

00:07:33.533 --> 00:07:37.133
the San Francisco Symphony
needs a great leader

00:07:37.133 --> 00:07:42.166
and the conductor of this project
is our very own conductor,

00:07:42.166 --> 00:07:43.900
Edwin Outwater.

00:07:43.900 --> 00:07:45.900
[Applause]
Ron: Hi, Edwin.

00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.667
[Applause] Edwin: Hello.

00:07:47.667 --> 00:07:49.166
Ron: Now, this is all you're
going to hear from me,

00:07:49.166 --> 00:07:51.700
but before you actually hear from them,

00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:54.233
we have a video clip for you.

00:07:54.233 --> 00:07:55.600
Thank you.

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.667
Lemony: "The Composer is Dead".

00:08:02.667 --> 00:08:13.533
â™ª [Low brass music playing]

00:08:13.533 --> 00:08:16.533
Lemony: "The Composer is Dead"
is a work for narrator and orchestra

00:08:16.533 --> 00:08:20.600
that introduces the orchestra to people
who may otherwise be unfamiliar with it

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:24.533
or reintroduces the orchestra to
people who are familiar with it.

00:08:24.533 --> 00:08:26.734
Nathaniel: We love classical music.

00:08:26.734 --> 00:08:30.533
We hoped that people would
listen to this piece and think,

00:08:30.533 --> 00:08:31.600
gosh, that's exciting.

00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:35.233
I mean, this can do all these things that
I didn't think an orchestra could do.

00:08:35.233 --> 00:08:37.133
â™ª [Light orchestral music playing]

00:08:37.133 --> 00:08:42.133
Lemony: Composer is a word which here
means a person who sits in a room,

00:08:42.133 --> 00:08:43.166
muttering,

00:08:43.166 --> 00:08:44.400
and humming,

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:49.400
and figuring out what notes is
the orchestra is going to play.

00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:53.100
This is called "composing".

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.166
â™ª [Light orchestral music playing]

00:08:54.166 --> 00:08:58.100
Lemony: But last night the composer
was not muttering,

00:08:58.100 --> 00:08:59.834
he was not humming,

00:08:59.834 --> 00:09:02.667
he was not moving or even breathing.

00:09:02.667 --> 00:09:05.867
[Light orchestral music playing]

00:09:05.867 --> 00:09:08.700
Lemony: This is called
"decomposing."

00:09:08.700 --> 00:09:11.233
[Laughing]

00:09:11.233 --> 00:09:13.100
Lemony: It is a piece that
is designed to be performed

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:14.166
for narrator and orchestra

00:09:14.166 --> 00:09:16.467
and then it also exists
as a recording

00:09:16.467 --> 00:09:18.633
by the San Francisco Symphony,

00:09:18.633 --> 00:09:23.800
it also exists as a book with the
recording tucked into the back.

00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:26.800
And so I like to think of the --

00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:29.834
the live performance of the piece
as kind of a butterfly,

00:09:29.834 --> 00:09:32.834
and the recording as kind of a
pinning down of the butterfly.

00:09:32.834 --> 00:09:33.500
Nathaniel: [Laughing]

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:35.633
Lemony: And then the book
is putting the pinned butterfly

00:09:35.633 --> 00:09:38.767
in a small glass box
for people to stare at.

00:09:38.767 --> 00:09:42.633
â™ª [Brass music playing fanfare]

00:09:42.633 --> 00:09:46.166
Lemony: The inspector was a very
handsome and intelligent person,

00:09:46.166 --> 00:09:47.700
not unlike myself.

00:09:47.700 --> 00:09:49.100
[Laughing]

00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:51.633
Lemony: "The Composer is Dead"
begins with a composer,

00:09:51.633 --> 00:09:52.734
who is dead.

00:09:52.734 --> 00:09:55.300
His death is suspicious

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:00.133
and thus an inspector is called in
and the inspector knows

00:10:00.133 --> 00:10:03.200
there are enemies of the composer
lurking in the orchestra

00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:06.967
and so interrogates the orchestra
section by section.

00:10:06.967 --> 00:10:10.100
Lemony: Perhaps the murderer
is lurking in the woodwinds.

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.100
Where were you last night,
woodwinds?

00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.000
Speak up.

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:14.200
Speak up.

00:10:14.200 --> 00:10:19.200
And each section of the orchestra
provides an alibi of varying credibility,

00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.900
and also shows off a bit
in terms of its own range.

00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.100
Lemony: "We were doing bird imitations",
said the flutes,

00:10:27.100 --> 00:10:31.266
the shiniest and highest
pitched of the woodwinds.

00:10:31.266 --> 00:10:33.633
It seems like that's all we ever do.

00:10:33.633 --> 00:10:37.300
Whenever the orchestra needs a bird,
there we are.

00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:45.266
â™ª [Flute music playing lightly]

00:10:45.266 --> 00:10:47.033
Lemony: Well, I like to think of
"The Composer is Dead"

00:10:47.033 --> 00:10:49.500
as sort of a gateway drug.

00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:50.000
Nathaniel: [Laughing]

00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:53.266
Lemony: That will lead to a lifetime
addiction to classical music.

00:10:53.266 --> 00:10:56.333
For me it was Beethoven's
third symphony, the Eroica,

00:10:56.333 --> 00:10:58.734
that kind of broke it wide open.

00:10:58.734 --> 00:11:00.667
You know, I couldn't stop
listening to it.

00:11:00.667 --> 00:11:02.166
And it's like any other addiction.

00:11:02.166 --> 00:11:04.166
Before I knew it I was listening to it alone,

00:11:04.166 --> 00:11:06.400
I was listening to it in the morning,

00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.000
and then slowly I went
from Beethoven to Bach,

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:11.934
I went from Bach to Mahler,

00:11:11.934 --> 00:11:15.000
I went from Mahler to Shostakovich,
and see that's -- that's --

00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.233
Nathaniel: That's addiction.
Lemony: -there's something wrong there.

00:11:17.233 --> 00:11:21.200
And I hope that that wrong
will spread like a virus.

00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.500
â™ª [Music playing lightly]

00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:24.667
Lemony: Oh. The violas.

00:11:24.667 --> 00:11:26.600
I forgot all about you.

00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.867
[Laughing]

00:11:28.867 --> 00:11:31.000
Lemony: Everyone forgets about us.

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:34.033
Said the violas bitterly.

00:11:34.033 --> 00:11:38.433
â™ª [Violas playing slowly]

00:11:38.433 --> 00:11:42.233
Lemony: We play the notes and
the chords that nobody cares about.

00:11:42.233 --> 00:11:45.734
â™ª [Violas playing slowly]
[Laughing]

00:11:45.734 --> 00:11:49.667
Lemony: We play crucial
countermelodies nobody hears.

00:11:49.667 --> 00:11:53.433
[Violas playing slowly]

00:11:53.433 --> 00:11:56.567
Lemony: We often have to
stay late after performances

00:11:56.567 --> 00:11:58.934
and stack up all of the chairs.

00:11:58.934 --> 00:12:00.567
â™ª [Violas playing slowly]
[Laughing]

00:12:00.567 --> 00:12:05.000
Nathaniel: The music covers
quite a lot of territory

00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.367
because I wanted people to get
the sense that the orchestra can do

00:12:09.367 --> 00:12:10.700
just about anything.

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.333
There's a waltz,

00:12:13.333 --> 00:12:18.133
there's a scene in a nightclub
that's basically techno,

00:12:18.133 --> 00:12:22.233
then there's this incredibly
menacing music every time

00:12:22.233 --> 00:12:27.400
he says the word "dead" which is this,
you know, growling --

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:29.700
Lemony: Thundering --
Nathaniel: - low brass.

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:32.233
Lemony: -- fanfare of doom that I wish

00:12:32.233 --> 00:12:36.233
I could hear every time I said the word
"dead" just in everyday life.

00:12:36.233 --> 00:12:45.200
[Low brass music playing]

00:12:49.333 --> 00:12:55.166
[Applause]

00:12:55.166 --> 00:12:57.633
Edwin: Hi, everybody.
I'm Edwin,

00:12:57.633 --> 00:13:01.700
the conductor of this book and
concert coming up on Sunday

00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:05.600
and I've been asked to kind
of interview these guys.

00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:09.266
And we all kind of started this project --
I first I kind of --

00:13:09.266 --> 00:13:12.000
I guess you guys both worked with
me before this project came out.

00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.367
First Daniel did a "Peter and the Wolf"
with the San Francisco Symphony

00:13:16.367 --> 00:13:18.433
which he re-wrote the words
to "Peter and the Wolf"

00:13:18.433 --> 00:13:22.033
and it really became kind like
a no exit or stranger.

00:13:22.033 --> 00:13:23.967
It's very, very depressing.

00:13:23.967 --> 00:13:25.834
We got a few complaint letters from that.

00:13:25.834 --> 00:13:28.066
And then we went on --

00:13:28.066 --> 00:13:29.433
Daniel: You did? Really?
Edwin: Yeah. We did.

00:13:29.433 --> 00:13:31.700
Daniel: Wow.

00:13:31.700 --> 00:13:33.734
I'm sorry. My mother has
a lot of time on her hands.

00:13:33.734 --> 00:13:36.900
[Laughing]

00:13:36.900 --> 00:13:39.000
Edwin: So we knew we needed
to move forward and do more,

00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.633
and Nathaniel, who was kind of from
the San Francisco Symphony family

00:13:42.633 --> 00:13:45.133
had written this wonderful
piece that we performed

00:13:45.133 --> 00:13:48.867
and then the idea came
up for this project to happen.

00:13:48.867 --> 00:13:54.133
Uh, a new work to kind of introduce the
orchestra to audiences young and old

00:13:54.133 --> 00:13:57.200
'cause there's still lots of people
who need to learn about the orchestra.

00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:00.133
Daniel: In the hopes of wrecking --
breaking the record for complaints.

00:14:00.133 --> 00:14:02.667
Edwin: Yeah. Exactly.
Daniel: We could outdo ourselves.

00:14:02.667 --> 00:14:05.667
Edwin: And so we're gonna
talk a little bit today about

00:14:05.667 --> 00:14:08.800
how it works and what makes
this project special.

00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.233
Apparently, umm,

00:14:11.233 --> 00:14:15.734
you can answer some questions
online Cliff mentioned to me

00:14:15.734 --> 00:14:18.166
and these are the questions:

00:14:18.166 --> 00:14:21.000
Who do you think killed the composer?

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:23.100
What instrument do you play?

00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.200
And what instrument
would you like to play?

00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:31.800
And we will give the results of that
towards the end of this presentation.

00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:33.266
And I'm speaking for all of you --

00:14:33.266 --> 00:14:35.500
Daniel: So you're encouraged
to only pay partial attention.

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:38.900
Edwin: Yeah.
[Laughing]

00:14:38.900 --> 00:14:40.600
Edwin: And we're very --
Daniel: That's the Google way.

00:14:40.600 --> 00:14:45.100
[Laughing]
[Applause]

00:14:45.100 --> 00:14:45.900
Edwin: Speaking of which,

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.233
I've never been part of someone's
work life balance before

00:14:49.233 --> 00:14:53.333
so it's really, really nice.
[Laughing]

00:14:53.333 --> 00:14:55.166
Daniel: We're more a part of
the work life imbalance, I would think.

00:14:55.166 --> 00:14:56.433
Edwin: Yeah. I suppose.

00:14:56.433 --> 00:14:58.934
So this piece -- you know there have
been a lot of pieces that were written

00:14:58.934 --> 00:15:03.433
for -- or some famous ones,
"Peter in the Wolf", by Prokofiev,

00:15:03.433 --> 00:15:06.233
"The Young Person's Guide to the
Orchestra" by Benjamin Britten,

00:15:06.233 --> 00:15:08.734
pieces which introduce
the different instruments,

00:15:08.734 --> 00:15:11.467
the different sounds that
can be found in an orchestra.

00:15:11.467 --> 00:15:14.400
In the case of "The Composer Is Dead"

00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:18.133
rather than kind of going into the sounds

00:15:18.133 --> 00:15:20.967
or what the instruments sound like,
like the oboe sounds like a duck,

00:15:20.967 --> 00:15:23.667
you guys have decided
to kind of talk about

00:15:23.667 --> 00:15:26.400
the stereotypes of an orchestra in a way,

00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:28.467
like you guys heard in the
presentation that I'm sure

00:15:28.467 --> 00:15:30.300
there's some sort of corporate
culture in Google,

00:15:30.300 --> 00:15:34.000
some sort of Google in jokes that which
I may learn about by the end of the day

00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:36.667
but in orchestra certainly
there are many jokes

00:15:36.667 --> 00:15:39.567
and kind of stereotypes
of the instruments.

00:15:39.567 --> 00:15:43.633
You may have noticed the violas
were referred to as kind of losers

00:15:43.633 --> 00:15:45.233
of the orchestra.

00:15:45.233 --> 00:15:48.367
And in fact if you go on,
for instance, viola.com

00:15:48.367 --> 00:15:52.033
you will see a list of
hundreds and hundreds of viola jokes.

00:15:52.033 --> 00:15:55.266
It's kind of a thing in the orchestra world.

00:15:55.266 --> 00:15:56.967
One such joke is,

00:15:56.967 --> 00:15:58.100
you know, you're driving a car,

00:15:58.100 --> 00:16:00.734
you see a conductor
and a violist in the road.

00:16:00.734 --> 00:16:02.800
Who do you run over first?

00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.567
The answer is the conductor.

00:16:04.567 --> 00:16:05.867
Business before pleasure.

00:16:05.867 --> 00:16:07.867
So that's kind of this --
[Laughing]

00:16:07.867 --> 00:16:08.533
Edwin: And it goes on and on.

00:16:08.533 --> 00:16:11.400
So and the flutes are kind
of uptight and depressed,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:13.166
even though they play happy
music all the time,

00:16:13.166 --> 00:16:16.567
the brass players are arrogant jerks.

00:16:16.567 --> 00:16:19.734
So what made you decide that angle?
What kind of brought you onto that?

00:16:19.734 --> 00:16:23.433
Nathaniel: We got together in a
cafe in the Haight --

00:16:23.433 --> 00:16:25.066
Daniel: Yes.

00:16:25.066 --> 00:16:26.734
Nathaniel: Basically because
I'd played in an orchestra,

00:16:26.734 --> 00:16:29.233
I gave Daniel everything that I knew,

00:16:29.233 --> 00:16:33.800
Daniel's also a musician so knew a fair
number of these things beforehand

00:16:33.800 --> 00:16:35.266
but I think for instance,

00:16:35.266 --> 00:16:40.066
the composer decomposing is
an old orchestra joke umm,

00:16:40.066 --> 00:16:43.600
and, uh, the viola stereotype
is certainly the --

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:48.500
that's the pillar of orchestra
lore in a way.

00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.033
Daniel: Yeah. I grew up as a boy soprano

00:16:52.033 --> 00:16:54.533
in the San Francisco boy's chorus,

00:16:54.533 --> 00:16:57.333
umm, I've played three seasons of
Amahl in Amhal and the Night Visitors

00:16:57.333 --> 00:16:59.633
in the Oakland Opera.

00:16:59.633 --> 00:17:02.467
I have my clippings with me if
people would like to see them after.

00:17:02.467 --> 00:17:04.567
Daniel: And, umm,

00:17:04.567 --> 00:17:08.467
and then puberty came along
and wrecked my career.

00:17:08.467 --> 00:17:13.033
And it had never really occurred to
me when I was a boy soprano that

00:17:13.033 --> 00:17:14.567
it could go downhill so quickly.

00:17:14.567 --> 00:17:17.500
Unlike playing just about any other
instrument you can keep it going.

00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:19.600
You can't actually --
once if you're a man

00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:21.934
and you develop your secondary
sex characteristics

00:17:21.934 --> 00:17:24.166
that's the end of your career
as a soprano.

00:17:24.166 --> 00:17:25.200
Nathaniel: I'm sorry.

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.900
Daniel: My parents say that
they considered castration

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.767
to keep my career going.
[Laughing]

00:17:30.767 --> 00:17:33.667
But they didn't do it.
[Laughing]

00:17:33.667 --> 00:17:36.667
Daniel: Umm, and so I think I funneled
some of that bitterness and jealousy

00:17:36.667 --> 00:17:41.266
towards people who do anything else
but sing in the world of classical music

00:17:41.266 --> 00:17:44.834
to exploit the stereotypes
while working on this piece.

00:17:44.834 --> 00:17:46.567
And, umm,

00:17:46.567 --> 00:17:49.133
the piece has been performed
all over the place.

00:17:49.133 --> 00:17:52.467
Umm, I have stepped in for
Lemony Snicket performing it

00:17:52.467 --> 00:17:55.266
on a number of occasions
and every time that I have

00:17:55.266 --> 00:17:58.700
at least one person in the orchestra
has told me that they're offended.

00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.600
So in that way --

00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.734
Nathaniel: Especially the concert
masters. It gives them a very bad rap.

00:18:02.734 --> 00:18:04.233
Daniel: Well, yeah.

00:18:04.233 --> 00:18:06.767
There's always someone
who's offended.

00:18:06.767 --> 00:18:11.233
Umm, the text of the piece says
that there are two kinds of violins,

00:18:11.233 --> 00:18:14.233
there are the first violins who
have the trickier parts to play

00:18:14.233 --> 00:18:17.567
and the second violins who are
more fun at parties. [Laughing]

00:18:17.567 --> 00:18:18.633
Daniel: Umm,

00:18:18.633 --> 00:18:22.533
and a second violinist came
up to me and said that uh,

00:18:22.533 --> 00:18:25.266
she just wanted me to know
that that wasn't true. [Laughing]

00:18:25.266 --> 00:18:28.867
Daniel: That it was only that
the first violins had the higher parts

00:18:28.867 --> 00:18:30.900
and the second violins
had slightly lower parts.

00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.500
And I said that don't worry.

00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:34.834
No one would ever think she
was more fun at parties.

00:18:34.834 --> 00:18:38.133
[Laughing]

00:18:38.133 --> 00:18:42.000
Daniel: And that didn't really resolve
the conflict, surprisingly. [Laughing]

00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:44.567
Daniel: Umm,

00:18:44.567 --> 00:18:48.900
but there've been various complaints
with each orchestra so, umm,

00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:51.533
I like to think that that's the piece --
Nathaniel: It's thinning out.

00:18:51.533 --> 00:18:53.834
Daniel: Yeah.

00:18:53.834 --> 00:18:56.166
Edwin: I think, uh,

00:18:56.166 --> 00:18:58.600
the words definitely kind of cover it.

00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.734
It's really like an insider's
look into orchestra life.

00:19:01.734 --> 00:19:03.133
'Cause orchestras are interesting things.

00:19:03.133 --> 00:19:05.967
I mean when we're in orchestra,

00:19:05.967 --> 00:19:10.400
as an orchestra musician people ask us
to this day is this a full-time job?

00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.333
You know, what do you do?

00:19:11.333 --> 00:19:14.033
Do you sell frozen yogurt
after the rehearsal?

00:19:14.033 --> 00:19:15.333
And, uh, of course,

00:19:15.333 --> 00:19:18.000
an orchestra like the San Francisco
Symphony is --

00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.367
is a group of musicians
who are like athletes, you know,

00:19:22.367 --> 00:19:25.400
there's incredibly difficult auditions
to get into the orchestra they play

00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:28.133
a different concert every
single week, umm --

00:19:28.133 --> 00:19:30.734
Nathaniel: Or more than one.
Edwin: Yeah, or more than one,

00:19:30.734 --> 00:19:33.133
like this Daniel Snicket project.

00:19:33.133 --> 00:19:35.567
In fact, this week there are two
separate orchestras going on

00:19:35.567 --> 00:19:38.066
at the San Francisco Symphony.
There's -- I think they're splitting two --

00:19:38.066 --> 00:19:42.867
and so this book kind of -- more than the
other book kind of gets into that world.

00:19:42.867 --> 00:19:46.767
And I want to talk a little bit about
the music, Nat, because, umm,

00:19:46.767 --> 00:19:50.867
when you came in here there was this
beautiful background music going on,

00:19:50.867 --> 00:19:52.367
you know, to get you nice and relaxed,

00:19:52.367 --> 00:19:55.867
which happened to be Beethoven
and Brahms, and Mozart

00:19:55.867 --> 00:19:59.967
and I wonder what they would
have thought of that,

00:19:59.967 --> 00:20:04.000
you know, to have their music
be background music at Google.

00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.100
The conductor --

00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:06.233
Nathaniel: Or in a book.
Edwin: Or in a book.

00:20:06.233 --> 00:20:10.734
Yeah. The conductor, Daniel Barenboim
kind of left the country

00:20:10.734 --> 00:20:13.867
because he was so offended by hearing
classical music as background music

00:20:13.867 --> 00:20:18.700
'cause obviously it's very far kind of from
where it was first intended to be written.

00:20:18.700 --> 00:20:22.500
And your music, uh,
it's not background music, I think.

00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:25.200
So how did you use the music --
did you start with the words

00:20:25.200 --> 00:20:27.467
or did you write the music
around the words?

00:20:27.467 --> 00:20:28.200
Nathaniel: Yeah, definitely.

00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:33.200
We talked at first and then
Daniel sent me a draft,

00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:35.600
which I butchered.
Umm,

00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:38.834
and the good thing is since Daniel
had -- was an opera fan he had --

00:20:38.834 --> 00:20:42.200
he was kind of expecting
his words to be butchered

00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:43.934
so that the music could be pasted --

00:20:43.934 --> 00:20:45.500
Daniel: And also 'cause I've
known you for a long time.

00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:48.000
Nathaniel: [Laughing]

00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:49.834
Daniel: Umm, Nathaniel and
I went to high school together

00:20:49.834 --> 00:20:51.734
and then didn't keep in touch, umm,

00:20:51.734 --> 00:20:53.834
and now I think both of us
kind of understand --

00:20:53.834 --> 00:20:56.133
Nathaniel: Understand why.
Daniel: -- wish it had gone on that way.

00:20:56.133 --> 00:20:58.266
[Laughing]

00:20:58.266 --> 00:21:01.166
Daniel: But so he was
presented with a draft of the text --

00:21:01.166 --> 00:21:03.667
Daniel: -- and then he would
invite me over to his house.

00:21:03.667 --> 00:21:05.066
It is.
Yes, it's awful.

00:21:05.066 --> 00:21:06.133
[Laughing]

00:21:06.133 --> 00:21:08.533
Daniel: I would get
upset about it if I thought about it.

00:21:08.533 --> 00:21:11.667
And, uh, then he would invite
me over to his house

00:21:11.667 --> 00:21:16.700
and he would prepare strange meals
from odd-ball vegetables

00:21:16.700 --> 00:21:18.433
found at local markets

00:21:18.433 --> 00:21:20.233
and, umm,

00:21:20.233 --> 00:21:21.900
and then he would say --

00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:23.333
he would play me a bit of a piece,

00:21:23.333 --> 00:21:27.000
sometimes on a piano,
sometimes on a very bad software

00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.533
he used to mimic the sound
of an orchestra.

00:21:29.533 --> 00:21:31.667
Terrible, probably made by Yahoo!

00:21:31.667 --> 00:21:32.934
if you know what I'm saying.
[Laughing]

00:21:32.934 --> 00:21:35.800
Daniel: And, umm,

00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:37.433
then, uh,

00:21:37.433 --> 00:21:40.834
he would say, you see now how we have
to -- the words need to be changed.

00:21:40.834 --> 00:21:44.400
And I would say,
not a single syllable, you cur.

00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:47.734
And you have to change every
single note in this piece.

00:21:47.734 --> 00:21:48.834
You've gotten it all wrong.

00:21:48.834 --> 00:21:51.200
And he would say, not a single note.
I'm the genius here.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:55.734
And then we would have, uh,
some, umm, beer. [Laughing]

00:21:55.734 --> 00:21:58.000
Daniel: I can say that
in front of young people; right?

00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:00.400
You shouldn't have any but --
[Laughing]

00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:02.767
Daniel: -- it's okay for me
to have as much as I want.

00:22:02.767 --> 00:22:08.066
Umm, and then I would say
all right just a few words.

00:22:08.066 --> 00:22:09.600
And he would say okay
just a few notes.

00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:13.200
And from that the collaboration
was hammered down.

00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:14.066
Hammered down.

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:17.900
With the emphasis on the word
"hammered" I guess [Laughing]

00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:20.767
Edwin: And your music, Nat, I mean,
when you were writing the music,

00:22:20.767 --> 00:22:22.633
were you thinking of kids,

00:22:22.633 --> 00:22:24.667
were you thinking of adults?
Like, were you thinking of --

00:22:24.667 --> 00:22:28.133
Nathaniel: I was thinking most of
all of the players in the orchestra

00:22:28.133 --> 00:22:31.300
'cause I wanted it to be fun for them.

00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:35.233
There's a lot of crappy children's
music that they have to play

00:22:35.233 --> 00:22:40.467
and I wanted this to be something
that they could sink their teeth into.

00:22:40.467 --> 00:22:43.300
You know, the jokes are kind
of inside jokes for them.

00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:46.567
And I actually wrote to the principals
of the symphony

00:22:46.567 --> 00:22:49.467
and got in trouble for doing
that but some of them --

00:22:49.467 --> 00:22:51.934
some of the players wrote back to me.
Like, the tuba player

00:22:51.934 --> 00:22:54.467
who has a great solo in this piece,

00:22:54.467 --> 00:22:56.834
umm, wrote me back and said,
sure, I'll meet with you.

00:22:56.834 --> 00:23:01.200
So we met and I said,
what do you most want to play?

00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:03.467
What would you really love to
play that you never get to play?

00:23:03.467 --> 00:23:09.066
And I said --
Daniel: And he said the guitar. [Laughing]

00:23:09.066 --> 00:23:11.266
Daniel: Sorry, I just --

00:23:11.266 --> 00:23:13.367
Nathaniel: Just like the poll
that we're asking you to do.

00:23:13.367 --> 00:23:14.834
Which instrument do you wanna play?

00:23:14.834 --> 00:23:17.066
He said -- so, anyway,
that's --

00:23:17.066 --> 00:23:20.100
I really wrote it first
for the players, umm,

00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:24.767
second probably for people of our
generation who never go to the symphony.

00:23:24.767 --> 00:23:26.100
Edwin: Which generation are we?

00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.266
Nathaniel: I don't know.
Whichever --

00:23:27.266 --> 00:23:28.467
Daniel: We're very young.

00:23:28.467 --> 00:23:30.600
Nathaniel: We're the youngest people here.

00:23:30.600 --> 00:23:35.367
Umm, and then probably lastly
for my kids' generation,

00:23:35.367 --> 00:23:36.533
who are important, too,

00:23:36.533 --> 00:23:40.333
but I was actually thinking
most of the friends of mine

00:23:40.333 --> 00:23:43.767
who never go to the symphony first

00:23:43.767 --> 00:23:45.633
and then hopefully they bring
their kids as well.

00:23:45.633 --> 00:23:48.266
Edwin: And so how -- you're writing for
people who don't go to the symphony

00:23:48.266 --> 00:23:49.667
what does that mean in are you --

00:23:49.667 --> 00:23:51.734
are you writing music that
they've heard before

00:23:51.734 --> 00:23:53.300
and kind of integrating to lure them in,

00:23:53.300 --> 00:23:57.633
or are you writing something
you just think they'll like, or --

00:23:57.633 --> 00:24:00.433
Nathaniel: I guess I wasn't
that calculating.

00:24:00.433 --> 00:24:03.767
I mean, it was really more, uh,

00:24:03.767 --> 00:24:04.834
fun for me.

00:24:04.834 --> 00:24:07.433
You know, I started from the words

00:24:07.433 --> 00:24:10.967
which are fun to begin with and I
wanted to write music that was fun.

00:24:10.967 --> 00:24:14.867
But yeah it does cover
kind of a wide range

00:24:14.867 --> 00:24:21.667
from about like this interview earlier
interview says techno and waltz.

00:24:21.667 --> 00:24:23.133
There's a lot of dance music.

00:24:23.133 --> 00:24:25.934
Edwin: So what are your techno influences?

00:24:25.934 --> 00:24:27.567
Nathaniel: Uh, you'd have to --

00:24:27.567 --> 00:24:28.767
I don't know what my influences are.

00:24:28.767 --> 00:24:31.900
Daniel knows a lot more about my
influences probably than I do.

00:24:31.900 --> 00:24:32.834
Edwin: What are Nat's influences?

00:24:32.834 --> 00:24:34.133
What are my techno influences?

00:24:34.133 --> 00:24:38.100
Daniel: Just 'cause I read his diary.

00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:40.233
Derek May. I don't know.

00:24:40.233 --> 00:24:44.166
Daniel: I guess the idea in incorporating
different styles was to

00:24:44.166 --> 00:24:46.133
become less lonely, frankly,

00:24:46.133 --> 00:24:49.533
because, umm, when you're
interested in classical music,

00:24:49.533 --> 00:24:52.633
as the three of us are,
people look at you funny.

00:24:52.633 --> 00:24:55.133
You know, so if you go and
you're sitting with friends

00:24:55.133 --> 00:24:58.834
and you all might talk about things
that you've read in a magazine,

00:24:58.834 --> 00:25:01.367
and everyone's on the same page,
and then you might talk about television,

00:25:01.367 --> 00:25:04.133
and everyone's talking about that, too,
and then you might talk about pop music

00:25:04.133 --> 00:25:06.800
and everyone's kinda friendly
and if someone says

00:25:06.800 --> 00:25:11.367
yeah, it actually reminds me of the
Shostakovich quartet there at the end.

00:25:11.367 --> 00:25:13.166
Slowly everyone --

00:25:13.166 --> 00:25:17.266
there's a -- you can -- there's a tangible
feeling that changes in the room.

00:25:17.266 --> 00:25:17.734
Nathaniel: I hate that.

00:25:17.734 --> 00:25:20.367
Daniel: And, umm,
it's a terrible feeling,

00:25:20.367 --> 00:25:22.533
it's very very lonely.
Nathaniel: Alienating.

00:25:22.533 --> 00:25:25.800
Daniel: Yeah. Yes. It's --
if there were a campus, say,

00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:28.633
for classical music lovers
it would be a lot smaller

00:25:28.633 --> 00:25:31.066
and the food would be
a lot worse -- [Laughing]

00:25:31.066 --> 00:25:32.834
Daniel: -- than the campus
that we're on now.

00:25:32.834 --> 00:25:37.734
And so I just thought that
if I seduced more people

00:25:37.734 --> 00:25:39.000
into the world of classical music

00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:42.633
then maybe I wouldn't be as lonely
and wretched as I am now. [Laughing]

00:25:42.633 --> 00:25:44.266
Edwin: So. Yeah.

00:25:44.266 --> 00:25:47.066
It's kind of sad.

00:25:47.066 --> 00:25:48.734
I did kinda the same background.

00:25:48.734 --> 00:25:52.166
I mean, for me I was,
I came into classical music later,

00:25:52.166 --> 00:25:54.567
uh, I was kind of a rock kid.

00:25:54.567 --> 00:25:56.200
My dad worked for a record company

00:25:56.200 --> 00:26:01.433
and my first concert was Alice Cooper
or something because -- you still --

00:26:01.433 --> 00:26:02.800
Daniel: For those that don't know
who she is --

00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:05.233
Edwin: She's a fantastic --
[Laughing]

00:26:05.233 --> 00:26:09.734
Daniel: Wonderful soprano.
[Laughing]

00:26:09.734 --> 00:26:12.333
Daniel: [Singing in high-piched voice]
â™ª School's out for summer.

00:26:12.333 --> 00:26:14.300
No.
[Laughing]

00:26:14.300 --> 00:26:16.533
Edwin: But I think we got pulled in,
you know, at one point.

00:26:16.533 --> 00:26:19.166
I mean, did you hear --
did you hear classical -- see,

00:26:19.166 --> 00:26:22.066
Daniel also works a lot
with rock musicians,

00:26:22.066 --> 00:26:24.000
you write about rock music sometimes.

00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:27.900
He was at one point working on
a compilation of 80s sync pop,

00:26:27.900 --> 00:26:30.600
you know, for Rhino Records
which may or may not come out.

00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.467
You play with the "Magnetic Fields",
"Steven Merit",

00:26:33.467 --> 00:26:36.166
so did you come to rock first or
did you come to classical first?

00:26:36.166 --> 00:26:38.000
Daniel: No, I came to
classical music first.

00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:39.300
I only listen to classical music.

00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:42.667
And in fact it was my friend,
David Fisher, in sixth grade,

00:26:42.667 --> 00:26:44.333
umm, who I'm sure you all know.

00:26:44.333 --> 00:26:46.934
Uh, he said to me --

00:26:46.934 --> 00:26:50.433
he gave me an album by
"Men at Work" and he said --

00:26:50.433 --> 00:26:55.800
-- you have to start listening to pop
music or no one's going to like you.

00:26:55.800 --> 00:26:58.834
That's the kind of loneliness and
desolation that I'm talking about.

00:26:58.834 --> 00:27:02.400
I'm not sure actually that in the long
run my deep love for Shostakovich

00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.500
which has served me not as well as
listening to the "Men at Work" album.

00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:08.767
I'm not sure actually listening to
"Men at Work" that makes me any cooler

00:27:08.767 --> 00:27:10.934
I didn't hear any popular music at all

00:27:10.934 --> 00:27:14.000
until I was --
until I was entering teenagerdom.

00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:15.100
Edwin: Hmm.

00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:17.000
Daniel: Which is also to be
said about background music.

00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:17.934
There was less of it.

00:27:17.934 --> 00:27:20.934
Nowadays you cannot --

00:27:20.934 --> 00:27:22.600
sometimes I'll read about a --

00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:24.633
a hit song and I think
I won't have heard it

00:27:24.633 --> 00:27:27.000
and I'll hear it and realize
I've heard it a thousand times

00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.133
because there's so many
opportunities to hear music.

00:27:29.133 --> 00:27:31.667
But when I was growing up there
wasn't as much music constantly

00:27:31.667 --> 00:27:33.166
in the air all the time.

00:27:33.166 --> 00:27:36.767
And so I only listened to classical
music and then came into pop.

00:27:36.767 --> 00:27:37.100
Edwin: Yeah.

00:27:37.100 --> 00:27:40.333
Daniel: There's still big swaths
of pop music I'm ignorant of

00:27:40.333 --> 00:27:45.734
'cause my parents didn't listen to it.
Neil Diamond, Barbara Streisand,

00:27:45.734 --> 00:27:47.033
I don't know --
I couldn't name -- yeah.

00:27:47.033 --> 00:27:48.867
Led Zeppelin.

00:27:48.867 --> 00:27:51.200
Nathaniel: Britney.
Daniel: Britney.

00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:52.800
Nathaniel: Only I listen to Britney.
Daniel: No. I wouldn't --

00:27:52.800 --> 00:27:55.233
Edwin: You have the weirdest musical
taste of anyone I've ever met, Nat.

00:27:55.233 --> 00:27:58.767
I mean, 'cause you actually don't listen
to a lot of music which is kind of cool.

00:27:58.767 --> 00:28:00.734
I mean --
I.

00:28:00.734 --> 00:28:01.900
Nathaniel: In a way.
Edwin: In a way.

00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:04.667
No because like I think Daniel
and I are more similar

00:28:04.667 --> 00:28:06.767
because we'll go to Amoeba Records
and, oh, have you heard this? Or this?

00:28:06.767 --> 00:28:08.133
Nathaniel: Cultural consumers.

00:28:08.133 --> 00:28:09.133
Edwin: Consuming stuff.

00:28:09.133 --> 00:28:12.934
Whereas you actually consume very
little music as kinda it comes in.

00:28:12.934 --> 00:28:15.000
You're much more kind of creating --

00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.533
Nathaniel: The only time I hear
music is at dance clubs.

00:28:18.533 --> 00:28:21.000
That's why I'm familiar with the work --

00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:22.333
Edwin: Yeah.
Nathaniel: -- of Miss Spears.

00:28:22.333 --> 00:28:24.600
[Laughing]

00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.000
Nathaniel: -- or at concert halls.
So,

00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:29.100
yeah, I don't listen to
a lot of recorded music.

00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:31.533
Edwin: So you're obsessed for
instance with the Umbrella Song,

00:28:31.533 --> 00:28:32.133
Rihanna --

00:28:32.133 --> 00:28:34.367
Nathaniel: Yeah. It's fantastic.

00:28:34.367 --> 00:28:36.166
Edwin: And did that make its way,

00:28:36.166 --> 00:28:38.734
some of this Britney and Rihanna,
into your --

00:28:38.734 --> 00:28:41.633
Nathaniel: I don't know. Well, you asked
earlier about my influences

00:28:41.633 --> 00:28:44.633
and I don't -- wouldn't say that I have
specific influences in that --

00:28:44.633 --> 00:28:46.867
I mean, the fact that I don't listen
to recorded music means

00:28:46.867 --> 00:28:49.667
I most often I don't know
what I'm listening to

00:28:49.667 --> 00:28:53.800
'cause I can't pick up the CD
or look on iTunes and what it is.

00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:55.967
It's just kind of all in the mix.

00:28:55.967 --> 00:28:58.233
If I'm at a club, umm,

00:28:58.233 --> 00:29:01.333
you know, there are all these
things are kind of drifting around.

00:29:01.333 --> 00:29:02.533
Uh,

00:29:02.533 --> 00:29:04.166
so no.

00:29:04.166 --> 00:29:05.567
Not in any specific way.

00:29:05.567 --> 00:29:08.800
Edwin: Mm hmm.
So --

00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:10.567
Daniel: Do you want me to get
your questions that you dropped?

00:29:10.567 --> 00:29:13.834
Edwin: No. That's just my rundown.
Daniel: All right.

00:29:13.834 --> 00:29:15.633
Edwin: So what would you like to --
Daniel: I felt bad for you when it dropped.

00:29:15.633 --> 00:29:18.066
I thought, there we go.
Edwin: I've heard that --

00:29:18.066 --> 00:29:22.533
Daniel: It's all over.
Edwin: I know.

00:29:22.533 --> 00:29:25.400
Anyway.

00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:26.767
I just learned --
can I say this?

00:29:26.767 --> 00:29:29.934
Can I talk about like what
might happen with this book?

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:30.200
Daniel: Sure.

00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.467
Edwin: You have --
you have all these ideas, like,

00:29:32.467 --> 00:29:35.667
one of which there's gonna be a puppet
show of this piece coming up at some point.

00:29:35.667 --> 00:29:38.133
Daniel: I am. I'm working
with some puppeteers,

00:29:38.133 --> 00:29:44.600
umm, because the goal of the piece
was to bring this music to a lot of people

00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.266
and one of the stumbling blocks
that I didn't anticipate

00:29:47.266 --> 00:29:50.233
was that there are so many places
where it's really not --

00:29:50.233 --> 00:29:51.834
they don't have a symphony orchestra

00:29:51.834 --> 00:29:54.567
and it's not feasible to bring
a symphony orchestra there.

00:29:54.567 --> 00:29:55.533
Umm,

00:29:55.533 --> 00:29:57.200
and that was a source
of frustration for me

00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:58.967
because when I go and talk
about the Lemony Snicket books

00:29:58.967 --> 00:30:00.233
I go all over the place.

00:30:00.233 --> 00:30:03.767
I go to towns that don't
have bookstores or libraries,

00:30:03.767 --> 00:30:05.834
and as well as big cities,
and suburbia,

00:30:05.834 --> 00:30:07.333
and all these places,

00:30:07.333 --> 00:30:10.133
so I thought, well, how hard can it be to
bring a whole symphony orchestra with you?

00:30:10.133 --> 00:30:13.433
As it turns out kinda hard.
So, umm --

00:30:13.433 --> 00:30:15.100
Edwin: Well, also you know, sorry.

00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:17.467
The piece itself is not easy to play and --
Daniel: Right.

00:30:17.467 --> 00:30:20.400
Edwin: -- in fact it takes more time --
it's actually quite difficult to pull off.

00:30:20.400 --> 00:30:22.533
Daniel: And people kept saying,
couldn't you just bring a piano player?

00:30:22.533 --> 00:30:26.734
And I said, well, it's hard to play a piece
that introduces the orchestra

00:30:26.734 --> 00:30:29.100
instrument by instrument -
Edwin: [Laughing]

00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:31.066
Daniel: -- and only have one instrument.
Nathaniel: As much as we'd love to do.

00:30:31.066 --> 00:30:34.934
Daniel: Yeah. Umm...
Edwin: [Laughing]

00:30:34.934 --> 00:30:37.233
Daniel: Umm, I said it in a more
incredulous tone of voice

00:30:37.233 --> 00:30:38.567
the first time they asked me.

00:30:38.567 --> 00:30:40.166
Umm, and so, uh,

00:30:40.166 --> 00:30:42.500
we had this recording
and I had an idea that

00:30:42.500 --> 00:30:44.200
we had the recording so we can bring it.

00:30:44.200 --> 00:30:46.633
And so at first I thought, well,
you can have an orchestra

00:30:46.633 --> 00:30:48.567
kind of lip syncing or not --

00:30:48.567 --> 00:30:52.633
or bow sinking and air violining fingering--
Edwin: Like the inauguration.

00:30:52.633 --> 00:30:54.767
Daniel: That didn't seem --
Edwin: [Humming]

00:30:54.767 --> 00:30:57.166
Daniel: That didn't seem feasible either

00:30:57.166 --> 00:30:59.367
and then I met these puppeteers

00:30:59.367 --> 00:31:01.300
and actually can make him communicate
through the world of music

00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:02.533
called Phantom Limb --

00:31:02.533 --> 00:31:04.600
I'm sure people are looking it up
right now online --

00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:07.867
uh, Phantom Limb and, umm,

00:31:07.867 --> 00:31:10.734
the -- it's a married couple
who makes these puppets

00:31:10.734 --> 00:31:13.066
and the husband used to be the bass
player in The Lounge Lizards

00:31:13.066 --> 00:31:14.767
which was a band I liked a lot.

00:31:14.767 --> 00:31:16.200
Erik Sanko.

00:31:16.200 --> 00:31:18.734
Glad to see someone's representative
for the Lounge Lizards here.

00:31:18.734 --> 00:31:20.967
And, umm,

00:31:20.967 --> 00:31:23.066
and so they're making puppets

00:31:23.066 --> 00:31:25.233
and I hope that will bring the puppet
show everywhere.

00:31:25.233 --> 00:31:28.100
They're really, really
awesome-looking puppets.

00:31:28.100 --> 00:31:31.133
Edwin: That could be lonelier than being
a classical musician, talking to puppets.

00:31:31.133 --> 00:31:33.200
Daniel: That's actually what was
nice about talking to puppeteers is

00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:37.100
when I've told them about my loneliness
there was a pause and then,

00:31:37.100 --> 00:31:41.333
he explained to me that he used to be
the bass player for this punk jazz band

00:31:41.333 --> 00:31:44.000
and he'd now moved into
the world of puppets.

00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:46.734
So I'd actually found a little
lonelier soul than I.

00:31:46.734 --> 00:31:48.333
[Laughing]

00:31:48.333 --> 00:31:50.133
Edwin: Well, I'd like to --
Daniel: So I hardly ever call him.

00:31:50.133 --> 00:31:52.934
[Laughing]

00:31:52.934 --> 00:31:56.433
Daniel: 'Cause I'm the popular
crowd compared to him.

00:31:56.433 --> 00:31:58.233
Edwin: I wanna talk about
one specific part of this piece

00:31:58.233 --> 00:32:01.600
'cause we're coming to the end
of this interview segment,

00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.300
even though I dropped my sheet
of paper I do remember that.

00:32:04.300 --> 00:32:08.433
And it's the kind of grand finale of
this piece, Nat, that you composed,

00:32:08.433 --> 00:32:12.700
in which I think, you're going to
kind of perform in just a little bit.

00:32:12.700 --> 00:32:14.533
And it's kind of the funeral march.

00:32:14.533 --> 00:32:16.100
Of course, as you might imagine,

00:32:16.100 --> 00:32:18.133
the end of this piece
involves a funeral march.

00:32:18.133 --> 00:32:21.100
Umm, and kind of a listing of
all the composers who are dead.

00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:23.400
Because another thing
about being classical --

00:32:23.400 --> 00:32:26.433
a classical musician is -- you're
working mostly with dead artists

00:32:26.433 --> 00:32:28.633
and you're trying to figure
out what they were --

00:32:28.633 --> 00:32:30.734
what they meant when they
wrote it 'cause they didn't --

00:32:30.734 --> 00:32:32.533
you know, there were
no recordings of

00:32:32.533 --> 00:32:36.333
Brahms or some maybe one or two
recordings of his friend Ruakey

00:32:36.333 --> 00:32:39.400
who played his violin concerto.
But anyway, umm,

00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:42.367
and what you did was really extraordinary.
You took --

00:32:42.367 --> 00:32:46.834
as each composer is named off,
you took an excerpt of his music--

00:32:46.834 --> 00:32:49.967
they're all male in this case --
and --

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:55.533
and kinda put a mosaic of music together
out of their pieces in their original key.

00:32:55.533 --> 00:32:57.200
Now that's difficult, actually,

00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.367
because, umm,

00:32:58.367 --> 00:33:01.700
these pieces are all in different keys
so to make it all come together

00:33:01.700 --> 00:33:06.433
as exact quotes is kind of incredibly
difficult puzzle to solve,

00:33:06.433 --> 00:33:08.033
umm, which is what you're gonna hear.

00:33:08.033 --> 00:33:11.600
So every time you hear the composer's
name you'll hear his music played.

00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:13.266
And what was that like doing that?

00:33:13.266 --> 00:33:15.333
I mean, that just seems
unbelievably tricky.

00:33:15.333 --> 00:33:18.500
Nathaniel: It was by far
the hardest part to write

00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:22.500
even though I didn't write any of it.
Umm... [Laughing]

00:33:22.500 --> 00:33:24.367
Nathaniel: Because I really wanted -

00:33:24.367 --> 00:33:28.700
even though this is a silly piece
I wanted these --

00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:34.200
I wanted this to be a tribute to these
composers and also to the players

00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:35.500
who are used to playing these things.

00:33:35.500 --> 00:33:39.433
You know, they have this music in their
fingers and you don't want it transposed.

00:33:39.433 --> 00:33:42.166
They want it where it --
where it belongs.

00:33:42.166 --> 00:33:49.000
And so it was a huge puzzle trying to figure
out how to put it together and get it to flow.

00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.066
There were 13 excerpts.

00:33:51.066 --> 00:33:54.100
Umm, but the good thing about it
from my point of view is that

00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:00.667
I can listen to it in this way and then
when you put Daniel's words on top of it,

00:34:00.667 --> 00:34:04.867
it suddenly becomes this hilarious thing

00:34:04.867 --> 00:34:09.867
and somehow it-- you know, those two -
those two poles don't detract for me.

00:34:09.867 --> 00:34:11.967
Umm, I think one of the great
things about --

00:34:11.967 --> 00:34:16.200
about music is that it has this potential
to express wildly different things

00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:20.233
and though people may think of
classical music of being stodgy,

00:34:20.233 --> 00:34:24.333
or having a particular sort of
mood about it can really --

00:34:24.333 --> 00:34:28.767
you have this huge palette and you can
do pretty much whatever you want with it.

00:34:28.767 --> 00:34:30.266
Daniel: Well, I've always thought that

00:34:30.266 --> 00:34:35.300
horror and hilarity were more or
less the same thing and, umm,

00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:38.667
it's true that towards the end
of The Composer is Dead, umm,

00:34:38.667 --> 00:34:43.367
it becomes clear that the composer's
death is pat of a conspiracy

00:34:43.367 --> 00:34:46.367
and that practically every composer
you've heard of is dead.

00:34:46.367 --> 00:34:48.600
And, umm,

00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:50.367
and so when I pointed that
out to Nathaniel

00:34:50.367 --> 00:34:53.433
he began to start working on this,
umm, funeral march

00:34:53.433 --> 00:34:57.066
that is this kind of mash up
of different excerpts

00:34:57.066 --> 00:35:01.333
that are all by the composers named
and are all pieces about death.

00:35:01.333 --> 00:35:04.633
And I was really worrying for him
when he was working on it

00:35:04.633 --> 00:35:07.266
because previously he'd been fairly calm.

00:35:07.266 --> 00:35:11.133
He had a piano where he
kind of tries out a few things

00:35:11.133 --> 00:35:15.467
and then this software that helps him
write all the -- keep all the parts straight

00:35:15.467 --> 00:35:17.066
but other than that he's
just kind of muttering

00:35:17.066 --> 00:35:19.700
and humming to himself like we all do.

00:35:19.700 --> 00:35:24.266
And -- or -- the two of us do, anyway.
Nathaniel: [Laughing]

00:35:24.266 --> 00:35:26.400
Daniel: And then when he started
working on this I would go and visit him

00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:29.133
and he had borrowed all
these scores from libraries,

00:35:29.133 --> 00:35:30.233
and friends, and things,

00:35:30.233 --> 00:35:32.934
that were all spread out all over the place

00:35:32.934 --> 00:35:38.400
and he was kind of trying to combine
them all into this thing and I --

00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:41.500
I realized that I had
suggested the idea

00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.433
that it was a conspiracy
of dead composers

00:35:43.433 --> 00:35:48.300
and that this idea was gonna
engulf him and kill him.

00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:54.033
Umm, but he did -- he did survive so far,
knock on plastic. [Laughing]

00:35:54.033 --> 00:35:57.400
Daniel: But what -- it was fascinating
to see that he was trying to work

00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.000
all of these other composers
in there together.

00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.133
It was a scary thing.

00:36:02.133 --> 00:36:05.000
It was kind of like, umm,

00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:08.333
you know, when you might
have a suspicious tenant

00:36:08.333 --> 00:36:10.300
and then you go in to visit
his apartment just to check

00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:12.433
and he has a bunch of pictures
of the President or something.

00:36:12.433 --> 00:36:14.834
It had that kind of creepy
feeling about it

00:36:14.834 --> 00:36:16.600
that he had all these scores
of dead composers

00:36:16.600 --> 00:36:19.033
and that he was working on
this piece about death.

00:36:19.033 --> 00:36:20.600
And --
Nathaniel: Bad karma.

00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:23.266
Daniel: And in some way it was a triumph
because how I knew him in high school is

00:36:23.266 --> 00:36:25.467
that he was tall and blond
and fluent in French

00:36:25.467 --> 00:36:27.033
and he could have any girl
that he wanted.

00:36:27.033 --> 00:36:29.133
So ... [Laughing]

00:36:29.133 --> 00:36:31.367
Nathaniel: So you saw me reduced
to this kind of --

00:36:31.367 --> 00:36:33.633

Daniel: It was kind of satisfying.

Nathaniel: -- putting up push pins

00:36:35.467 --> 00:36:37.567
Daniel: Yeah. And then our
reunion was coming up,

he would be a trembling figure.

But he's recuperated,
more or less.

Edwin: I think --
Daniel: I'll perform that part.

00:36:45.767 --> 00:36:47.934
As you can see,
there's no orchestra here

00:36:47.934 --> 00:36:49.300
so we're using the recording,

00:36:49.300 --> 00:36:51.000
but I'll play the part of the narrator

00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.567

00:36:55.567 --> 00:36:57.433
Edwin: Did we ever practice this?

00:36:57.433 --> 00:37:00.433

this before in my life.

Umm, the first question shall we do the --

00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:02.633
we'll start out with the easy one.
Did you play an instrument growing up?

00:42:02.633 --> 00:42:05.100
The clear winner is the piano.

00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:08.567
It seems to be the popular thing,
though harder to carry these days.

00:42:08.567 --> 00:42:09.900
Edwin: What are the next ones?

00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:11.433
Cliff: And then we had guitar,

00:42:11.433 --> 00:42:14.233
and then my personal favorite, the cello.

00:42:14.233 --> 00:42:15.934
Edwin: That was three?
Cliff: That was three.

00:42:15.934 --> 00:42:17.800
Edwin: I had a violin.

00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:19.367
For those of you who have kids,

00:42:19.367 --> 00:42:20.633
don't teach them the violin.

00:42:20.633 --> 00:42:22.500
Teach them the bassoon.

00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:25.867
Or the base clarinet,
or the trom -- we need those.

00:42:25.867 --> 00:42:28.033
We need those in orchestra.
I used to run a youth orchestra --

00:42:28.033 --> 00:42:29.834
Daniel: I you had children
you'd feel differently.

00:42:29.834 --> 00:42:30.734
Edwin: I don't know.

00:42:30.734 --> 00:42:33.266
'Cause we have all these kids lining up
to audition to do something

00:42:33.266 --> 00:42:35.300
and they all play violin.

00:42:35.300 --> 00:42:36.934
Bassoon.

00:42:36.934 --> 00:42:38.333
Viola. Sorry.

00:42:38.333 --> 00:42:41.500
They might get beaten up that way.
Daniel: Comb and tissue paper.

00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:45.934
Cliff: So -- or the musical saw
as in one of the productions I've seen.

00:42:45.934 --> 00:42:49.200
And then we have the saxophone
rounding out the folks

00:42:49.200 --> 00:42:52.567
that didn't play an instrument,
or played the flute.

00:42:52.567 --> 00:42:54.133
So on the other hand the --

00:42:54.133 --> 00:42:56.900
Daniel: Wait. People who didn't play an
instrument played the saxophone?

00:42:56.900 --> 00:43:01.967
Cliff: Well, it -- it depends on what
you were listening to but yeah.

00:43:01.967 --> 00:43:05.567
There were more saxophone players than
folks that did not play an instrument.

00:43:05.567 --> 00:43:05.967
Daniel: Oh.

00:43:05.967 --> 00:43:08.100
Edwin: It's the Lisa Simpson
influence, I think.

00:43:08.100 --> 00:43:09.400
Cliff: Basically. Yeah.

00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.133
Umm, and then --

00:43:10.133 --> 00:43:13.700
Daniel: or John Coltrane.

00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:18.166
Cliff: In terms of the instruments
of people's dreams once again

00:43:18.166 --> 00:43:22.967
my personal favorite, although the
bassoon was a close -- not on the list.

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:25.934
The cello rounded out first,

00:43:25.934 --> 00:43:27.867
we had the piano and drums,

00:43:27.867 --> 00:43:31.200
followed by one of the more difficult
instruments in the orchestra,

00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.967
which is the air guitar,

00:43:32.967 --> 00:43:37.633
umm, violin beating out the pipe organ.

00:43:37.633 --> 00:43:39.433
Daniel: Hmm.
Cliff: So.

00:43:39.433 --> 00:43:43.200
Daniel: In real life the violin
could never beat out the pipe organ.

00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:46.867
Cliff: Just by force of shear numbers
it's just not gonna happen.

00:43:46.867 --> 00:43:49.734
Daniel: It would be --
it's the pipes really. You know.

00:43:49.734 --> 00:43:50.900
Cliff: The pipes will do you in.

00:43:50.900 --> 00:43:51.767
Daniel: Yep.

00:43:51.767 --> 00:43:55.433
Cliff: And then finally the question
of who done

00:43:55.433 --> 00:43:58.333
it is voted by the results
of Google moderator

like I said in my intro,

no one suspects the sousaphones,

00:44:23.767 --> 00:44:28.300

out some sort of co-conspiracy bit.

Daniel: Wow!

00:44:29.467 --> 00:44:31.333

Daniel: We went and did this
in Saudi Arabia

00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:02.767
and everyone had to ask questions

00:45:02.767 --> 00:45:04.734
but here in America --

00:45:04.734 --> 00:45:06.734
-- you don't have to.

00:45:06.734 --> 00:45:07.934
Nathaniel: Yeah. Question?

00:45:07.934 --> 00:45:09.533
&gt;&gt; Read one from the, uh --

00:45:09.533 --> 00:45:13.000

into the microphone for, umm --

00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.600
Nathaniel: Posterity.
Daniel: Posterity, yeah.

00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:15.667
We wouldn't wanna lose this.

00:45:15.667 --> 00:45:18.467
[Laughing]

00:45:18.467 --> 00:45:20.900
&gt;&gt; Well, I don't have any questions
of my own but somebody asked,

00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:24.533
are there any plans to
extend the performance dates?

00:45:24.533 --> 00:45:26.633
Daniel: Umm,

00:45:26.633 --> 00:45:31.834
well, not extend the performance dates in
that we can't camp out at the Flint Center

00:45:31.834 --> 00:45:33.900
and see if more people are up for it.

00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:35.467
But, umm,

00:45:35.467 --> 00:45:39.667
the piece has been performed all
over the place, all over America,

00:45:39.667 --> 00:45:43.567
and I -- it was the most performed
piece of new music last year

00:45:43.567 --> 00:45:46.367
which is a little bit like being
the world's tallest midget --

00:45:46.367 --> 00:45:50.900
-- but it's still --
[Laughing]

00:45:50.900 --> 00:45:53.200
Nathaniel: And it appeared
in German last season.

00:45:53.200 --> 00:45:54.834
It also appeared in Australian.

00:45:54.834 --> 00:45:55.233
Daniel: Yes.

00:45:55.233 --> 00:45:58.166
So, umm --
[Laughing]

00:45:58.166 --> 00:46:00.133
Daniel: You should, if you live on earth,

00:46:00.133 --> 00:46:05.400
umm, it will be more or less
convenient to go see it.

00:46:05.400 --> 00:46:07.800
I mean,

00:46:07.800 --> 00:46:09.433
like, where you live on earth.
Edwin: It's not like a Broadway runner.

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.533
You kinda have to wait and --

00:46:10.533 --> 00:46:14.200
Daniel: Yeah.
Edwin: It's come back.

00:46:14.200 --> 00:46:17.967
&gt;&gt; Could you say a little more about
the difficulty of performing this?

00:46:17.967 --> 00:46:21.166
I just -- this subject just came up, umm,

00:46:21.166 --> 00:46:25.133
as a new Naxos recording
of some wind band music

00:46:25.133 --> 00:46:29.834
and the composer was talking about
why he was so pleased to do --

00:46:29.834 --> 00:46:35.133
to compose for a wind band
because you could get their attention

00:46:35.133 --> 00:46:38.133
to actually rehearse a really
complicated piece

00:46:38.133 --> 00:46:42.333
and orchestras only get to like play
something three times and, you know.

00:46:42.333 --> 00:46:45.033
Edwin: Oh, Yeah. Well,
a lot of -- you know,

00:46:45.033 --> 00:46:47.934
since we're doing a different concert
every week at the San Francisco ,

00:46:47.934 --> 00:46:50.000
we have a limited amount
of time to prepare it.

00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:52.300
And sometimes, umm, I mean,
the orchestras are such virtuosos

00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:57.033
they can often play things very quickly in
one rehearsal of a Beethoven symphony,

00:46:57.033 --> 00:46:59.600
or even in a read through
of a Beethoven symphony,

00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:02.967
umm, with San Francisco I would say
70 percent of our audience

00:47:02.967 --> 00:47:05.533
couldn't tell the difference of,
you know, what we actually work on.

00:47:05.533 --> 00:47:07.133
It's kind of like this higher stuff,

00:47:07.133 --> 00:47:09.266
to ultra refine things 'cause
the players are so great.

00:47:09.266 --> 00:47:12.100
When it's a new piece it
takes a little bit more time.

00:47:12.100 --> 00:47:15.266
So what made it challenging is that,

00:47:15.266 --> 00:47:19.266
umm, there's no collective memory of the
piece for the orchestra when we play it,

00:47:19.266 --> 00:47:20.633
though we did it this time,

00:47:20.633 --> 00:47:23.200
we had done it three years ago
and they remembered

00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:26.266
a great deal of the piece even though
they've played 40, you know,

00:47:26.266 --> 00:47:28.400
hundreds and hundreds of pieces
in between

00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:31.300
which is kind of what's so amazing
about an orchestra.

00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.367
And I find usually the more complex
the music is as far as writing,

00:47:36.367 --> 00:47:38.567
the more hard it is to play sometimes.

00:47:38.567 --> 00:47:44.433
I mean, this idea of Nat's to combine
this kind of mosaic of composers

00:47:44.433 --> 00:47:46.300
was sort of the hardest part to rehearse.

00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:50.166
Umm, the Right of Spring Stravinsky
excerpt is often done in different meters.

00:47:50.166 --> 00:47:53.266
We had to do it -- it was notated
differently so the players were, like,

00:47:53.266 --> 00:47:55.367
seeing this kinda piece turned
upside down in front of them.

00:47:55.367 --> 00:47:57.934
They got -- actually,
some of them screamed

00:47:57.934 --> 00:47:59.100
playing the Right of Spring in four

00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:01.066
'cause it was usually in
one, two one, two, three.

00:48:01.066 --> 00:48:04.633
So, umm, but it's a thrill and that's
what makes orchestras --

00:48:04.633 --> 00:48:07.500
orchestral music I think has
a level of complexity,

00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:09.533
uh, that, you know,
I could objectively say,

00:48:09.533 --> 00:48:12.433
you know, having written and
listened to all sorts of music,

00:48:12.433 --> 00:48:15.433
and having loved all sorts of
music has a level of complexity,

00:48:15.433 --> 00:48:19.834
umm, that other kinds of music don't
have as far as how they're put together.

00:48:19.834 --> 00:48:24.000
Now, jazz can be incredibly complex
if it needs be or a rock --

00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.767
a great guitar solo but there's something
about the notes being written down

00:48:27.767 --> 00:48:30.700
and combined on the page, uh,

00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:34.100
from Bach's playing way back there's
that connection between that mad mix

00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:37.667
in music that makes classical music
particularly challenging I think.

00:48:37.667 --> 00:48:39.100
Daniel: And I think also, umm,

00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:43.100
because it's a piece for children
that some orchestras think,

00:48:43.100 --> 00:48:46.567
oh, well, how complicated can it be?

00:48:46.567 --> 00:48:48.400
Which reminds me -
Nathaniel:--and they tend to pigeon hole.

00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:49.133
Daniel: Yeah.

00:48:49.133 --> 00:48:52.066
So then we get there and they say,
oh, gosh. It's actually really hard.

00:48:52.066 --> 00:48:56.033
It actually remind me a little bit of,
umm, having children.

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:58.266
[Laughing]

00:48:58.266 --> 00:49:00.700
Daniel: You think, well,
you need a little bed, right?

00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.000
And then you're kinda done.
[Laughing]

00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.767
Daniel: Umm, and it turns out,
you know--

00:49:07.767 --> 00:49:09.200
Daniel: Just to --

00:49:09.200 --> 00:49:12.633
I mean, my son's five now and
he's still shaky on the difference

00:49:12.633 --> 00:49:18.200
between sweet and dry vermouth.
It's -- [Laughing]

00:49:18.200 --> 00:49:20.867
Daniel: I don't know how many times
I have to go over it with him. [Laughing]

00:49:20.867 --> 00:49:22.967
Nathaniel: Did you have
another question?

00:49:22.967 --> 00:49:24.900
&gt;&gt; Let's see. I'll start off
with a word of warning.

00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:27.367
I've never encountered a puppet
orchestra that can handle

00:49:27.367 --> 00:49:29.800
anything written in A sharp,
so, you know.

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:32.266
Daniel: Good to know.

00:49:32.266 --> 00:49:35.233
&gt;&gt; Second, as a former tuba player,
I thank you for, you know,

00:49:35.233 --> 00:49:39.934
of corresponding with them and
they're very rarely heard from.

00:49:39.934 --> 00:49:42.100
My question was, umm,

00:49:42.100 --> 00:49:46.467
there's a sort of tradition of combining
humor and music with people

00:49:46.467 --> 00:49:48.667
like Anna Russel and Peter Schickele

00:49:48.667 --> 00:49:51.066
and I was wondering
if you drew on them at all,

00:49:51.066 --> 00:49:52.500
if you're familiar with them.

00:49:52.500 --> 00:49:55.967
Nathaniel: I didn't really.
As Edwin said earlier I'm not --

00:49:55.967 --> 00:49:57.667
I spend all day writing music

00:49:57.667 --> 00:50:02.500
so I don't really have a lot
left to listen to music.

00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.767
Umm, I did, uh,

00:50:04.767 --> 00:50:08.400
meet Peter Schickele when I was working
with the North Carolina Symphony

00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:11.633
and I admire what he does
but I couldn't say that

00:50:11.633 --> 00:50:15.467
I really know what
he does enough to have --

00:50:15.467 --> 00:50:17.333
to be influenced by it familiarly.

00:50:17.333 --> 00:50:21.433
What really guided me
were Daniel's words.

00:50:21.433 --> 00:50:25.000
Edwin: Would you find that humor makes
its way into your music generally

00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.967
or is this an exception?

00:50:26.967 --> 00:50:30.000
Nathaniel: Well, I guess it maybe
has more but I do think that

00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:35.800
music can express anything
and that we, umm --

00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:39.200
you know, the idea that music --
classical music especially --

00:50:39.200 --> 00:50:44.233
has to be serious, and highbrow,
and high-minded all the time

00:50:44.233 --> 00:50:47.567
I think is -- is limiting it.

00:50:47.567 --> 00:50:53.100
So yeah, I mean, I think a lot of my music
has little sections that are quirky

00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:57.734
and then sections that, for me,
at least, writing them are moving.

00:50:57.734 --> 00:51:03.433
I mean I wouldn't say that I was really
looking at people who do one kinda thing.

00:51:03.433 --> 00:51:07.967
I mean, if anything, my model
would be Mozart. You know.

00:51:07.967 --> 00:51:09.533
Daniel: He's good.
Nathaniel: He's good.

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:10.867
Edwin: Also funny.
Daniel: Yeah.

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.533
Nathaniel: And -- and -- that's
what I mean. That's what I mean.

00:51:12.533 --> 00:51:14.300
That he had a sense of humor,

00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:17.633
you know, it wasn't, just like this is
fun music or this is kids music,

00:51:17.633 --> 00:51:18.867
this is grown up music,

00:51:18.867 --> 00:51:20.033
this is serious music,

00:51:20.033 --> 00:51:22.834
this is new music which
means it's one kind of way.

00:51:22.834 --> 00:51:26.734
I mean, I wanted it to be just,

00:51:26.734 --> 00:51:28.166
you know, bigger, rounder.

00:51:28.166 --> 00:51:30.433
Daniel: That's one of the admirable
things about Nathaniel Stookey's music

00:51:30.433 --> 00:51:32.333
is that it crosses a lot of boundaries.

00:51:32.333 --> 00:51:35.266
In fact, the first commission that
he received after this commission

00:51:35.266 --> 00:51:37.100
from the San Francisco Symphony --

00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:38.867
-- was to become the first composer
in residence

00:51:38.867 --> 00:51:40.967
at the San Francisco City dump.
[Laughing]

00:51:40.967 --> 00:51:44.734
Nathaniel: Yeah. So you can go listen to
junkestra which is somewhere online at

00:51:44.734 --> 00:51:48.233
that sunset scavenger and it's a very,
you know, very different thing

00:51:48.233 --> 00:51:52.834
'cause it's a very different breed.

00:51:52.834 --> 00:51:56.400
Edwin: It's all instruments
made of junk, by the way.

00:51:56.400 --> 00:52:00.700
&gt;&gt; So, my son was pretty into classical
music when he was, like, three, four, five.

00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:05.266
Umm, I guess it was just very visceral
and he enjoyed that part of it.

00:52:05.266 --> 00:52:06.700
But now at seven, eight,

00:52:06.700 --> 00:52:10.700
it's got no lyrics so he's
not interested in it.

00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:11.300
It's boring.

00:52:11.300 --> 00:52:12.467
Edwin: You tried to raise him right.

00:52:12.467 --> 00:52:14.934
&gt;&gt; So the answer -- you know,

00:52:14.934 --> 00:52:16.700
obvious answer is,
well, opera.

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:19.367
But you know,
that has its issues.

00:52:19.367 --> 00:52:24.700
Umm, most of which is that it's not in
English and he can't understand any of it.

00:52:24.700 --> 00:52:29.834
So, umm, can you throw out
any pieces with actual,

00:52:29.834 --> 00:52:34.033
you know, narration or opera
in English that might be,

00:52:34.033 --> 00:52:37.066
you know, appealing or
interesting to this --

00:52:37.066 --> 00:52:41.033
the same age group
that this appeals to?

00:52:41.033 --> 00:52:45.700
Daniel: A piece with narrator and
orchestra.

00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:51.467
Edwin: I don't --I think you're kinda tapping
into a bigger subject with kids and music.

00:52:51.467 --> 00:52:55.200
I think if my dad gave me anything
to listen to I would be, like, no,

00:52:55.200 --> 00:52:56.066
when I was a little kid.

00:52:56.066 --> 00:53:00.233
In fact, when -- when I was -- my parents
tried to play classical music for me

00:53:00.233 --> 00:53:04.533
when I was young and
I would turn off the radio.

00:53:04.533 --> 00:53:06.767
I wouldn't listen to it just
because of the way in which

00:53:06.767 --> 00:53:09.400
it was being transmitted
to me as a kid.

00:53:09.400 --> 00:53:12.633
And I found myself coming
back to it at around 14.

00:53:12.633 --> 00:53:14.500
I -- just through my friends,

00:53:14.500 --> 00:53:17.900
and through playing music in
the schools and it kind of, uh,

00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.533
kind of took me.

00:53:19.533 --> 00:53:23.066
But I think if my parents hadn't played
it for me when I was younger

00:53:23.066 --> 00:53:28.033
that maybe wouldn't have primed me
to accept it later on in life, you know.

00:53:28.033 --> 00:53:29.900
And, umm,

00:53:29.900 --> 00:53:31.834
I think the visceral comment
is also interesting

00:53:31.834 --> 00:53:36.734
because there's this weird culture that's
evolved around classical music that, umm,

00:53:36.734 --> 00:53:40.066
that it's not visceral, umm,
which is actually not --

00:53:40.066 --> 00:53:42.433
the composers are being
shocked to know that.

00:53:42.433 --> 00:53:45.367
Because what's more visceral
than a hundred people, like,

00:53:45.367 --> 00:53:49.800
playing together in a live -- in
a live kind of situation in umm,

00:53:49.800 --> 00:53:51.734
compared to rock 'n' roll
I know what you mean.

00:53:51.734 --> 00:53:54.066
There's not a beat or this or that.

00:53:54.066 --> 00:53:59.033
But one -- I think all three of our missions
in life is that the music actually has

00:53:59.033 --> 00:54:03.433
fundamentally visceral qualities and fun
qualities but the culture around the music,

00:54:03.433 --> 00:54:05.467
umm, like this kind of --

00:54:05.467 --> 00:54:08.200
the stilted background music
we heard as we walked in,

00:54:08.200 --> 00:54:11.333
or this kind of atmosphere that
has developed in the concert hall

00:54:11.333 --> 00:54:14.633
over the years that has to do with
kind of Edith Wharton novels, you know,

00:54:14.633 --> 00:54:17.333
this dressy, where you clap in
between movements.

00:54:17.333 --> 00:54:20.867
Daniel: Which I would also
add or grossly misinterpret.

00:54:20.867 --> 00:54:23.533
People are poisoning each other in
Edith Wharton novels all the time.

00:54:23.533 --> 00:54:24.533
[Laughing]

00:54:24.533 --> 00:54:27.667
Edwin: But I -- it's kind of a mission,
you know?

00:54:27.667 --> 00:54:30.200
Daniel: They are. You know? When
people think Edith Wharton novel,

00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:32.166
they think, oh, lord Worthington,

00:54:32.166 --> 00:54:35.166
when actually it's this
back stabbing murder.

00:54:35.166 --> 00:54:36.300
It's great.

00:54:36.300 --> 00:54:39.033
Edwin: Yeah. But there's this culture
that grows up around art

00:54:39.033 --> 00:54:40.233
that makes it untouchable.

00:54:40.233 --> 00:54:43.033
People who are really fans of it
treat it and put it up on a pedestal.

00:54:43.033 --> 00:54:45.000
You're not supposed to
clap in between movements.

00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:46.767
Someone told me that once.

00:54:46.767 --> 00:54:49.667
I was conducting a Mozart concert
and someone, this woman said,

00:54:49.667 --> 00:54:52.467
what do you think about people clapping
in between the Mozart symphony?

00:54:52.467 --> 00:54:56.033
I said, well, you know, I liked it,
and Mozart actually liked it, too,

00:54:56.033 --> 00:54:59.033
'cause when Mozart's time people not
only clapped in between movements,

00:54:59.033 --> 00:55:00.200
they encored the movements.

00:55:00.200 --> 00:55:02.233
They would clap until
you had to play it again.

00:55:02.233 --> 00:55:05.300
And that's totally vanished
and I would much rather hear

00:55:05.300 --> 00:55:08.367
applause in between movements
than candy wrappers and coughing

00:55:08.367 --> 00:55:10.734
which is the thing that's developed
in place of that.

00:55:10.734 --> 00:55:12.700
I think it's absolutely bizarre, you know.

00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.266
But for kids I love Right of Spring, man.

00:55:15.266 --> 00:55:16.300
That's my piece.

00:55:16.300 --> 00:55:17.367
Daniel: That's true.
That's true.

00:55:17.367 --> 00:55:19.767
Nathaniel: I wouldn't go with the lyrics.
Edwin: No lyrics yet.

00:55:19.767 --> 00:55:22.767
Nathaniel: Because if you try
to find something with lyrics

00:55:22.767 --> 00:55:24.200
it's just not gonna satisfy them

00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:27.500
'cause they're not gonna be lyrics
they're gonna that they wanna hear about.

00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:28.433
I don't know, you said he's eight.

00:55:28.433 --> 00:55:31.133
So, like, fast women, and.

00:55:31.133 --> 00:55:32.100
Souped up cars.
You know,

00:55:32.100 --> 00:55:36.600
you're not gonna find the right lyrics
so I would just, like, go for --

00:55:36.600 --> 00:55:37.934
for, you know music --

00:55:37.934 --> 00:55:39.667
Right of Spring I think would be great.

00:55:39.667 --> 00:55:40.734
Edwin: Stravinsky Right of Spring.

00:55:40.734 --> 00:55:43.000
Like if you've never been
to an orchestra concert,

00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:44.033
you wanna see something,

00:55:44.033 --> 00:55:45.467
you wanna bring your kids,

00:55:45.467 --> 00:55:46.500
go see that piece.

00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.700
It's a great starter for the twenty-first
century even though it was written --

00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.433
Daniel: Stay away from things like this.

00:55:52.433 --> 00:55:54.967
Nathaniel: Did you have a --
did you have a question?

00:55:54.967 --> 00:55:55.934
&gt;&gt; Yeah. I had a question.

00:55:55.934 --> 00:56:01.767
Umm, most of the classical music I've
heard has been background music,

00:56:01.767 --> 00:56:05.033
umm, and I can say I like that
or I don't like that

00:56:05.033 --> 00:56:09.166
but I get the feeling there's a whole
lot more to appreciating the structure

00:56:09.166 --> 00:56:14.533
that goes into the music and
knowing movements versus,

00:56:14.533 --> 00:56:17.200
uh, you know, all the different
musical forms,

00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:25.000
how does one learn about that in order
to appreciate the music itself better?

00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.734
Daniel: I don't think you have to

00:56:26.734 --> 00:56:31.166
is how I feel but I may get some
argument with my industry members.

00:56:31.166 --> 00:56:32.567
Nathaniel: No.
Edwin: I totally agree.

00:56:32.567 --> 00:56:33.767
Daniel: But it's, umm,

00:56:33.767 --> 00:56:38.166
because I listen to, uh, classical
music all the time and often

00:56:38.166 --> 00:56:42.967
am completely ignorant of its structures
and its work so in a way that,

00:56:42.967 --> 00:56:46.433
umm, there are people who think
that if you don't know

00:56:46.433 --> 00:56:50.133
how a recording studio works you
can never have a true appreciation

00:56:50.133 --> 00:56:54.233
of the White album, it's not true.

00:56:54.233 --> 00:56:56.734
You know, but you meet
audio files all the time.

00:56:56.734 --> 00:56:58.467
It's the production on this.

00:56:58.467 --> 00:56:59.600
And I think, uh-uh.

00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:01.400
Turn it off, please.

00:57:01.400 --> 00:57:03.233
Nathaniel: If there is one thing,

00:57:03.233 --> 00:57:05.300
I see you have a child on your lap,

00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.200
it is -- it's learning music.

00:57:08.200 --> 00:57:11.266
Umm, I mean, we treat --
my son asks me all the time,

00:57:11.266 --> 00:57:13.433
well, how come I have to
have music lessons?

00:57:13.433 --> 00:57:15.166
And he never comes to me and says,

00:57:15.166 --> 00:57:17.333
how come I have to do long division?

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:18.834
It just doesn't occur to him.

00:57:18.834 --> 00:57:22.066
Everyone around him has to do
long division and so does he.

00:57:22.066 --> 00:57:23.333
And the more you, you know,

00:57:23.333 --> 00:57:28.500
if you know the language you're gonna
respond to it that much more so.

00:57:28.500 --> 00:57:31.533
But I don't think it should prevent
you from enjoying it at other levels.

00:57:31.533 --> 00:57:34.333
Edwin: And I think, you know, for me when
I wanted to learn more I read liner notes.

00:57:34.333 --> 00:57:35.000
It was very simple.

00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:37.533
It's like there's a lot of information
out about the music

00:57:37.533 --> 00:57:41.467
and the more you're into it just little bits --
online of course there are hundred things.

00:57:41.467 --> 00:57:45.333
Andante.com I think has a million,
umm, composer references.

00:57:45.333 --> 00:57:48.333
Daniel: Search on, you know, like, hotbot,
or like, those, one of the great.

00:57:48.333 --> 00:57:49.567
Edwin: Yahoo! , Scoop,
one of the things like that.

00:57:49.567 --> 00:57:52.967
Daniel: There's really great search engines.

00:57:52.967 --> 00:57:54.200
Edwin: It's all out there.

00:57:54.200 --> 00:57:55.800
Cliff: All right. And to build off that,
of course, umm,

00:57:55.800 --> 00:57:58.266
one of the questions at the door did
mention Leonard Bernstein

00:57:58.266 --> 00:58:02.433
did a fabulous series of recordings
introducing young people.

00:58:02.433 --> 00:58:03.600
Edwin: On DVD.
Yeah.

00:58:03.600 --> 00:58:06.567
They're called Young People's
Concerts with New York online.

00:58:06.567 --> 00:58:11.000
Cliff: And then the final parting thought of
the inspiration hit me as I was sitting here

00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:15.700
in the talk one way that the literary
world is bringing in a new audience

00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.633
to the twenty-first century is a book
that just recently came out

00:58:18.633 --> 00:58:22.066
that's called "Pride and Prejudice
and Zombies."

00:58:22.066 --> 00:58:23.667
Edwin: And zombies.
Yeah. That's great.

00:58:23.667 --> 00:58:26.233
Cliff: So I -- I think maybe we might --

00:58:26.233 --> 00:58:27.867
Daniel: It would also be a
great puppet show.

00:58:27.867 --> 00:58:29.000
Cliff: Exactly.

00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:31.200
So we could have, like,
Claude Debussy and Zombies.

00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:33.867
Edwin: Reader, I Ate Him.
Whatever.

00:58:33.867 --> 00:58:35.467
Cliff: So on that note,

00:58:35.467 --> 00:58:38.166
on behalf of the Musicians@google
and the San Francisco Symphony

00:58:38.166 --> 00:58:40.233
we wanna thank you gentlemen
for speaking with us.

00:58:40.233 --> 00:58:40.533
Thank you very much.
[Applause]

00:58:40.533 --> 00:58:42.166
Thank you guys.

00:58:42.166 --> 00:58:43.900
Daniel: You dropped your wallet.

00:58:43.900 --> 00:58:48.300
[Applause]
