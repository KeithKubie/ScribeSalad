world efforts and three pillars

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:19.790
world efforts and three pillars
 

00:01:19.790 --> 00:01:21.730
world efforts and three pillars
basically the first one is about

00:01:21.730 --> 00:01:21.740
basically the first one is about
 

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:24.190
basically the first one is about
responsible enjoyment of our products

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:24.200
responsible enjoyment of our products
 

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:26.380
responsible enjoyment of our products
that's key because again our sense of

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:26.390
that's key because again our sense of
 

00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:29.469
that's key because again our sense of
purpose is to to brew the best quality

00:01:29.469 --> 00:01:29.479
purpose is to to brew the best quality
 

00:01:29.479 --> 00:01:32.200
purpose is to to brew the best quality
beers for the very finest moments in

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:32.210
beers for the very finest moments in
 

00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:34.149
beers for the very finest moments in
life when you're celebrating having good

00:01:34.149 --> 00:01:34.159
life when you're celebrating having good
 

00:01:34.159 --> 00:01:35.950
life when you're celebrating having good
times and bringing people together the

00:01:35.950 --> 00:01:35.960
times and bringing people together the
 

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.870
times and bringing people together the
second pill is about the environment I

00:01:37.870 --> 00:01:37.880
second pill is about the environment I
 

00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:40.899
second pill is about the environment I
mean we draw our raw materials from the

00:01:40.899 --> 00:01:40.909
mean we draw our raw materials from the
 

00:01:40.909 --> 00:01:43.660
mean we draw our raw materials from the
environment special water so for us it's

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:43.670
environment special water so for us it's
 

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:46.270
environment special water so for us it's
very important to minimize any impacts

00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:46.280
very important to minimize any impacts
 

00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:49.389
very important to minimize any impacts
that we have in environment and that's

00:01:49.389 --> 00:01:49.399
that we have in environment and that's
 

00:01:49.399 --> 00:01:50.770
that we have in environment and that's
why that's the second pill of the whole

00:01:50.770 --> 00:01:50.780
why that's the second pill of the whole
 

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:52.779
why that's the second pill of the whole
part of all the environment and just

00:01:52.779 --> 00:01:52.789
part of all the environment and just
 

00:01:52.789 --> 00:01:55.569
part of all the environment and just
this year it's months ago we came out

00:01:55.569 --> 00:01:55.579
this year it's months ago we came out
 

00:01:55.579 --> 00:01:58.149
this year it's months ago we came out
with global targets for the next three

00:01:58.149 --> 00:01:58.159
with global targets for the next three
 

00:01:58.159 --> 00:02:02.080
with global targets for the next three
years and three things three pillars one

00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:02.090
years and three things three pillars one
 

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.510
years and three things three pillars one
is water consumption we're committed to

00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:04.520
is water consumption we're committed to
 

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:06.190
is water consumption we're committed to
reduce water consumption by almost

00:02:06.190 --> 00:02:06.200
reduce water consumption by almost
 

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:07.599
reduce water consumption by almost
twenty percent from the levels we have

00:02:07.599 --> 00:02:07.609
twenty percent from the levels we have
 

00:02:07.609 --> 00:02:09.340
twenty percent from the levels we have
today and come to three and a half

00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:09.350
today and come to three and a half
 

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.340
today and come to three and a half
liters per liter of beer produced by the

00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:12.350
liters per liter of beer produced by the
 

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:15.250
liters per liter of beer produced by the
end of the year 2012 the second one is

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.260
end of the year 2012 the second one is
 

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.530
end of the year 2012 the second one is
on heat and energy consumption and

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:17.540
on heat and energy consumption and
 

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.050
on heat and energy consumption and
therefore carbon emission reduce it by

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.060
therefore carbon emission reduce it by
 

00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:22.950
therefore carbon emission reduce it by
ten percent next three years

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:22.960
ten percent next three years
 

00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.140
ten percent next three years
and the third one it's about the

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:25.150
and the third one it's about the
 

00:02:25.150 --> 00:02:27.600
and the third one it's about the
recyclability of all my products today

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:27.610
recyclability of all my products today
 

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:29.520
recyclability of all my products today
we send a 98-percent we want to get to

00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:29.530
we send a 98-percent we want to get to
 

00:02:29.530 --> 00:02:31.740
we send a 98-percent we want to get to
99 percent so again that's the second

00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:31.750
99 percent so again that's the second
 

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:33.870
99 percent so again that's the second
pillar and the third pillar is the whole

00:02:33.870 --> 00:02:33.880
pillar and the third pillar is the whole
 

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:36.120
pillar and the third pillar is the whole
thing about community involvement again

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:36.130
thing about community involvement again
 

00:02:36.130 --> 00:02:38.760
thing about community involvement again

for those communities and work together
with them and issues that in which we

00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:45.490
with them and issues that in which we
 

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.050
with them and issues that in which we
can help because that's just the right

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:49.060

you

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:01.470
 
 

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.890
 
I think sustainability is one of those

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:03.900
I think sustainability is one of those
 

00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:09.200
I think sustainability is one of those
things that if you can get to it in a

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:09.210
things that if you can get to it in a
 

00:03:09.210 --> 00:03:11.810
things that if you can get to it in a
win-win type situation that's the best

00:03:11.810 --> 00:03:11.820
win-win type situation that's the best
 

00:03:11.820 --> 00:03:14.180
win-win type situation that's the best
way so if you can do it because it's not

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:14.190
way so if you can do it because it's not
 

00:03:14.190 --> 00:03:16.370
way so if you can do it because it's not
only the right thing to do but it makes

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:16.380
only the right thing to do but it makes
 

00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:18.740
only the right thing to do but it makes
business sense then you can be clear

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:18.750
business sense then you can be clear
 

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:20.750
business sense then you can be clear

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:20.760
it's not going to be a fad it's not
 

00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.220
it's not going to be a fad it's not
going to be a one or two-year program

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:22.230
going to be a one or two-year program
 

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:23.930
going to be a one or two-year program
it's going to be a way to manage your

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:23.940
