00:00:03.109 --> 00:00:05.150
SPEAKER: Well, to everyone
here in Mountain View,

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:07.240
welcome, good afternoon.

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.200
For the Googlers tuning in
around the world, good morning,

00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:12.180
good evening to you as well.

00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:13.690
We're in for a treat today.

00:00:13.690 --> 00:00:15.754
We're here with Erik Larson.

00:00:15.754 --> 00:00:16.920
Erik, thinks for being here.

00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.295
ERIK LARSON: Thank
you very much.

00:00:18.295 --> 00:00:19.250
Thanks for having me.

00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:21.070
SPEAKER: So Erik, as
you all probably know,

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:24.420
is the author of a number
of bestselling books.

00:00:24.420 --> 00:00:27.200
Some really great ones,
"Devil in the White City,"

00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.099
"Thunderstruck," "In
the Garden of Beasts."

00:00:30.099 --> 00:00:31.640
And his latest book,
which we're here

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.460
to talk about
today, "Dead Wake -

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.210
The Last Crossing
of the Lusitania"

00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:40.120
is now number one on "The New
York Times" Best Sellers list.

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:43.427
We've got some prepared Q&amp;A.
We'll take some time, maybe

00:00:43.427 --> 00:00:45.760
halfway through, half an hour
in, and take some audience

00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.850
questions.

00:00:46.850 --> 00:00:49.420
I'm sure you have
many, out there.

00:00:49.420 --> 00:00:51.460
And we're good to go.

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:54.430
I'll begin with a
general one, Erik.

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:55.990
So what's the process
you go through

00:00:55.990 --> 00:00:57.870
to pick your subject
material, and

00:00:57.870 --> 00:01:00.490
how did you stumble
across the "Lusitania?"

00:01:00.490 --> 00:01:03.140
ERIK LARSON: The processes
is generally, stumbling.

00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:04.572
Yeah.

00:01:04.572 --> 00:01:06.780
The "Lusitania" came about
in sort of an unusual way,

00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.620
because it's not
the kind of thing

00:01:08.620 --> 00:01:12.790
that I might
typically want to do.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:14.820
I like an idea that
has-- what, when

00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:16.090
I used to work for "The
Wall Street Journal,"

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.675
we referred to as--
barriers to entry.

00:01:17.675 --> 00:01:20.480
That is to say competitive.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.320
Something that would
make it less likely

00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.070
that somebody else
would do the same book.

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:26.444
Like "Devil in the White City"
or my book "Thunderstruck"

00:01:26.444 --> 00:01:28.810
about Marconi and
Crippen, and so forth.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:31.060
But I'd always been
interested in the "Lusitania."

00:01:31.060 --> 00:01:32.922
I'd always been interested
maritime history.

00:01:32.922 --> 00:01:35.130
Frankly, I would have done
a book about the "Titanic"

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.041
if it hadn't been done to death
by James Cameron and Celine

00:01:38.041 --> 00:01:38.540
Dion.

00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.430
You know?

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:44.860
But it just seemed, at first,
too obvious, too familiar.

00:01:44.860 --> 00:01:47.850
Until I just-- I really had
nothing else on my plate,

00:01:47.850 --> 00:01:49.100
so I started reading about it.

00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:51.590
I was aware that in
five years-- this

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:54.780
goes back to five years ago--
I was aware that in five years

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:57.354
there would be the
100th anniversary.

00:01:57.354 --> 00:01:58.770
I don't usually
like to peg things

00:01:58.770 --> 00:02:00.097
to anniversaries,
because I don't think

00:02:00.097 --> 00:02:01.330
anybody particularly cares.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.070
And it also
practically guarantees

00:02:03.070 --> 00:02:05.740
that somebody else is going
to be doing the same book.

00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:08.550
But, as a former journalist,
it gave me a reason

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:09.960
for doing it, like, now.

00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:11.190
Why do it today?

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.415
And that quieted
that voice, so--

00:02:13.415 --> 00:02:14.220
SPEAKER: I see.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.940
Wonderful.

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.290
You alluded to a question
I was going to ask later,

00:02:17.290 --> 00:02:19.170
but now is a good time.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.380
Why has the "Lusitania"
not received

00:02:21.380 --> 00:02:24.480
the same intrigue as
something like the "Titanic?"

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:25.768
ERIK LARSON: Leo DiCaprio.

00:02:25.768 --> 00:02:28.260
[LAUGHTER]

00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:29.440
You know, it's interesting.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:31.898
I think, frankly, a lot of it
does have to do with the fact

00:02:31.898 --> 00:02:34.640
the "Titanic" predated
the "Lusitania."

00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.210
And the "Titanic" was
so full of glamour,

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:40.630
and pathos, and
sank in three hours

00:02:40.630 --> 00:02:44.010
with not enough
lifeboats, the whole saga.

00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:45.645
Maybe if the "Titanic"
had never sunk,

00:02:45.645 --> 00:02:48.310
the "Lusitania" might be
a more prominent thing

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.990
in people's eyes.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:53.214
But I think another factor is
that we're all taught-- well,

00:02:53.214 --> 00:02:54.630
I can't speak for
everybody here--

00:02:54.630 --> 00:02:57.590
but I know I was taught
about the "Lusitania"

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:58.820
strictly in passing.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:03.350
In a European survey
history course,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.320
where the "Lusitania" was that
was a dusty geopolitical node

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:10.930
on the timeline heading
toward World War I.

00:03:10.930 --> 00:03:13.720
And nobody ever really got
into the details of the thing.

00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:17.409
It was when I started
reading some of the details

00:03:17.409 --> 00:03:19.700
about the actual sinking,
that's what really hooked me.

00:03:19.700 --> 00:03:22.960
For example, one of the
first things that kind of

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:25.550
lit my imagination, was when I
learned that during the sinking

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:28.540
itself, one fully
loaded lifeboat fell

00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:31.000
on top of another
fully loaded lifeboat.

00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.350
That was kind of, whoa, I
never knew any of that stuff.

00:03:34.350 --> 00:03:36.620
Or that three
passengers were sucked

00:03:36.620 --> 00:03:39.069
into one of the gigantic
funnels during the sinking,

00:03:39.069 --> 00:03:40.985
and then were blown out
again, alive and well.

00:03:40.985 --> 00:03:43.510
You know, covered with
soot, but-- so there

00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:44.780
were all these little details.

00:03:44.780 --> 00:03:47.070
That's what made me
think, I'm going to write

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:48.880
about the sinking, itself.

00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.030
SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:52.290
I think the context of
these passengers knowing

00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:54.870
about the "Titanic" disaster
just three years prior,

00:03:54.870 --> 00:03:57.180
that actually sets up the
first theme I'd like to chat

00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.710
about today, which is intel.

00:03:59.710 --> 00:04:01.620
Both of the passengers
and crew that

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:03.871
are heading out on the
"Lusitania," but then also

00:04:03.871 --> 00:04:06.370
the folks in Britain and around
the world who are monitoring

00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.450
what Germany's doing.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:08.241
ERIK LARSON: Right.

00:04:08.241 --> 00:04:10.340
SPEAKER: So we'll talk
about the passengers first.

00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:15.686
The morning, May 1, 1915, that
the ship is to depart New York.

00:04:15.686 --> 00:04:17.810
Can you talk to us about
the ads that are taken out

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:18.540
in the newspapers?

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:19.290
ERIK LARSON: Yeah.

00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.420
So this was May 1, 1915.

00:04:22.420 --> 00:04:24.560
It's a Saturday morning.

00:04:24.560 --> 00:04:26.430
And in the newspapers
in New York

00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:30.790
that morning, there was an
advertisement-- actually, it's

00:04:30.790 --> 00:04:33.990
called a notice, or a warning--
from the German Embassy,

00:04:33.990 --> 00:04:35.890
aimed at anybody
who was going to be

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:40.010
traveling into the so-called war
zone around the British Isles.

00:04:40.010 --> 00:04:43.160
It was not aimed specifically
at the "Lusitania,"

00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:46.890
and frankly, it was in there
that day strictly by chance.

00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:49.970
One of the many
weird chance things

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:52.160
that happened in association
with the "Lusitania."

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.760
But it essentially reiterated
that there was this war zone,

00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.160
and if you were going to
sail to the United Kingdom,

00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.580
you did so at your own risk.

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:01.390
Now, in "The New
York World" this ad

00:05:01.390 --> 00:05:04.190
was right next to Cunard's
add for the "Lusitania."

00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:05.990
And elsewhere around
the country it

00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:08.660
was interpreted that the ad
was aimed at the "Lusitania."

00:05:08.660 --> 00:05:11.570
It was not, but that was
how it was perceived.

00:05:11.570 --> 00:05:14.980
And yet 2,000 people got
on that ship that day.

00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:15.480
You know?

00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.410
And only like, two or
three people canceled.

00:05:18.410 --> 00:05:22.040
Now, if it were me, and
somebody said that, you know,

00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.230
you're going to fly from here
to London at your own risk,

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:26.655
I'd be off that plane so fast.

00:05:26.655 --> 00:05:27.336
You know?

00:05:27.336 --> 00:05:28.614
SPEAKER: Right.

00:05:28.614 --> 00:05:31.210
Well, that's actually the
heart of the question.

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:32.907
Why do these people
get on board?

00:05:32.907 --> 00:05:34.490
There's a great
quote, and forgive me,

00:05:34.490 --> 00:05:36.260
I don't have it in front of me.

00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:39.330
Somebody describes how the
entire voyage, the passengers

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:41.320
are thinking torpedo.

00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:42.139
Eating torpedo--

00:05:42.139 --> 00:05:43.930
ERIK LARSON: Thinking,
eating, and dreaming

00:05:43.930 --> 00:05:44.960
submarines and torpedoes.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:45.501
SPEAKER: Yes.

00:05:45.501 --> 00:05:46.390
ERIK LARSON: Yeah.

00:05:46.390 --> 00:05:49.077
Yeah, but that
was one passenger.

00:05:49.077 --> 00:05:50.660
I don't know that
that was commonplace

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:52.070
among the passengers.

00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:53.842
I think one of the
things that I find

00:05:53.842 --> 00:05:56.050
when doing this kind of
history, and it's referred to

00:05:56.050 --> 00:05:57.049
as narrative nonfiction.

00:05:57.049 --> 00:05:58.830
I don't particularly
like that label,

00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:03.099
but one of the things that I
have found in doing my books

00:06:03.099 --> 00:06:05.140
is that it is very important
to put yourself back

00:06:05.140 --> 00:06:06.820
into the point of
view of the era.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:09.600
PoV as screenwriters
like to call it.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:13.045
And so you can't look back
and say, what on earth

00:06:13.045 --> 00:06:14.170
were those people thinking?

00:06:14.170 --> 00:06:15.470
Why did they get on that ship?

00:06:15.470 --> 00:06:16.176
You can't do it.

00:06:16.176 --> 00:06:18.300
You have put yourself in
the mind of the passengers

00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.290
back then.

00:06:19.290 --> 00:06:21.870
And what was going on then,
really, was first of all,

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.192
there was this belief that
the "Lusitania" was too big.

00:06:25.192 --> 00:06:27.150
Now this may sound familiar
in terms of banks--

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:32.170
it was too big and too fast
to be caught by a submarine.

00:06:32.170 --> 00:06:35.300
There was also the prevailing
and pervasive belief

00:06:35.300 --> 00:06:38.330
that the rules of
maritime warfare

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:41.170
forbade any sort of attack
on a civilian liner.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.410
Which was, in fact, the case
for the prior 100 years.

00:06:44.410 --> 00:06:46.330
But what nobody really
realized, even yet,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:49.360
was that the rules were
changing very, very quickly

00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:51.570
because the submarine.

00:06:51.570 --> 00:06:53.220
And then further,
one other component

00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:55.550
was, that Cunard was assuring
people that by the time

00:06:55.550 --> 00:06:59.780
the ship entered the
so-called war zone,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:03.790
it would be under the
protection of the Royal Navy.

00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:06.065
Which turned out
not to be the case.

00:07:06.065 --> 00:07:06.940
SPEAKER: Sure.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.580
A wonderful illusion,
speaking of rules

00:07:09.580 --> 00:07:12.640
of maritime engagement,
it's all changing

00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:14.080
with U-boats and submarines.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:16.274
Can you talk to
us about Room 40?

00:07:16.274 --> 00:07:17.690
ERIK LARSON: Yeah,
Room 40 was one

00:07:17.690 --> 00:07:18.890
of the things that
really surprised me

00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:20.100
as I got into the research.

00:07:20.100 --> 00:07:24.030
Room 40 was this top,
top, ultra-secret entity

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:29.110
within the Admiralty in Britain,
that was set up very early

00:07:29.110 --> 00:07:34.760
in the war to take advantage of
three nearly miraculous events.

00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.360
And that was the
acquisition, in short order,

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:42.870
by British intelligence, of the
German Navy's-- and actually,

00:07:42.870 --> 00:07:46.140
the German diplomatic
side of things, as well--

00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:51.130
the three most important
codebooks that the Germans had.

00:07:51.130 --> 00:07:54.540
And their acquisition of
these codebooks was secret.

00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:56.680
The Germans had no idea.

00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.900
And Churchill and company, a
handful of others, the secret

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:03.320
was restricted to a
handful of people.

00:08:06.090 --> 00:08:08.930
Churchill felt that
these codebooks could

00:08:08.930 --> 00:08:10.700
be used to great advantage.

00:08:10.700 --> 00:08:12.770
This establishment,
Room 40, named

00:08:12.770 --> 00:08:15.410
after the room in the Admiralty
Building, the Old Admiralty

00:08:15.410 --> 00:08:17.550
Building in London.

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:21.280
Their job was to take wireless
messages from the German

00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:26.330
Navy that had been intercepted,
decode and decipher them.

00:08:26.330 --> 00:08:28.400
And in so doing, they
became actually very adept.

00:08:28.400 --> 00:08:30.460
They were reading just
about every German Naval

00:08:30.460 --> 00:08:32.890
communication throughout
most of the war,

00:08:32.890 --> 00:08:36.500
through this entity, Room 40.

00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:39.850
SPEAKER: OK, so what did they
know as the "Lusitania" was

00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:41.190
actually making the voyage?

00:08:41.190 --> 00:08:43.559
Things are changing out
there in the war zone.

00:08:43.559 --> 00:08:45.110
What did Room 40 learn about?

00:08:45.110 --> 00:08:48.870
ERIK LARSON: Room 40 knew
a lot about the submarine

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:51.960
that ultimately sank
the "Lusitania."

00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:56.250
The submarine was U-20, under
the command of one Captain

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:57.870
Walther Schwieger.

00:08:57.870 --> 00:09:01.886
And what Room 40 knew
was, first of all

00:09:01.886 --> 00:09:04.100
they knew exactly
what his orders were.

00:09:04.100 --> 00:09:06.230
And they were not to
sink the "Lusitania,"

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.810
they were to sink
any large troop

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.689
transport that he encountered.

00:09:10.689 --> 00:09:11.980
They knew what his orders were.

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:17.450
They knew exactly what time
that day he left Germany.

00:09:17.450 --> 00:09:20.380
They knew his exact course
for the first 24 hours,

00:09:20.380 --> 00:09:25.540
because his radio man sent
position reports back to base,

00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.890
as a sort of way of
testing reach and range

00:09:28.890 --> 00:09:32.040
of the wireless apparatus
on the submarine.

00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:36.010
So in that first 24
hours, they knew exactly,

00:09:36.010 --> 00:09:37.930
as if using a sexton,
knew exactly where

00:09:37.930 --> 00:09:39.160
the submarine was.

00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:42.550
Most important, they knew,
because of intercepts,

00:09:42.550 --> 00:09:47.440
exactly where U-20 was supposed
to set up its patrol, which

00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:49.850
was right off Liverpool.

00:09:49.850 --> 00:09:53.090
Right in the path where all
the Cunard ships come and go.

00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:57.640
Where many, many other ships,
cargo and otherwise, passed.

00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:58.500
SPEAKER: OK.

00:09:58.500 --> 00:10:01.460
And do they follow
what U-20 does?

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.470
There's other vessels that are
coming before the "Lusitania."

00:10:04.470 --> 00:10:05.871
Does the threat change at all?

00:10:05.871 --> 00:10:08.370
ERIK LARSON: Well, what happens
is, you know, at some point,

00:10:08.370 --> 00:10:12.300
inevitably, U-20 lost radio--
lost wireless contact,

00:10:12.300 --> 00:10:15.990
there was no voice radio at that
point-- lost wireless contact

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:17.400
with its home base.

00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:22.740
And therefore Room 40
had nothing to intercept.

00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:25.220
But the presumption
was that it should

00:10:25.220 --> 00:10:28.150
have been, that U-20
was still moving down

00:10:28.150 --> 00:10:31.190
the far side of the Irish
coast toward its patrol zone.

00:10:31.190 --> 00:10:35.020
But then came the two
days before, well, the day

00:10:35.020 --> 00:10:36.240
before the actual sinking.

00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:41.040
The 24 hour to 48 hour
period where U-20 made itself

00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.940
known in a very, very
dramatic way, sinking

00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:46.640
three ships in short order.

00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.550
SPEAKER: OK.

00:10:47.550 --> 00:10:50.030
And I think that's the heart
of what my question has been,

00:10:50.030 --> 00:10:51.510
after reading the book.

00:10:51.510 --> 00:10:54.220
You also refer to Churchill.

00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:59.680
I think he'd written a letter
where he'd said that as Germany

00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:01.107
talked about this war zone--

00:11:01.107 --> 00:11:02.940
ERIK LARSON: Well, this
is early in the war.

00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:04.080
I think you're talking
about the letter he

00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:05.457
wrote to the Board of Trade.

00:11:05.457 --> 00:11:06.040
SPEAKER: Yeah.

00:11:06.040 --> 00:11:08.520
ERIK LARSON: Where he says--
it's very interesting,

00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:09.530
what he wrote.

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.650
And it has a
subsequent resonance

00:11:12.650 --> 00:11:14.780
that's very compelling.

00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.610
He's writing about how
important it was-- you know,

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.490
Britain being, of
course, an island nation,

00:11:19.490 --> 00:11:22.007
they needed all the supplies
they could get by sea.

00:11:22.007 --> 00:11:23.590
And he was writing
about how important

00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:28.170
it was that Britain get as
much traffic-- merchant marine

00:11:28.170 --> 00:11:31.190
traffic, cargo ships,
civilian ships--

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:33.037
from America as possible.

00:11:33.037 --> 00:11:35.370
And then comes the very telling
paragraph where he says,

00:11:35.370 --> 00:11:39.950
and if any of that shipping gets
into trouble, all the better.

00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:40.840
All the better.

00:11:40.840 --> 00:11:42.840
SPEAKER: And this is
before the "Lusitania" is--

00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:45.132
ERIK LARSON: This is well
before the "Lusitania," yeah.

00:11:45.132 --> 00:11:47.048
SPEAKER: You fall short,
in the book, I think,

00:11:47.048 --> 00:11:48.640
of calling it an
all-out conspiracy.

00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:49.760
And I wonder why.

00:11:49.760 --> 00:11:52.150
ERIK LARSON: I didn't
have the material

00:11:52.150 --> 00:11:53.815
to call it a
conspiracy, so I hang it

00:11:53.815 --> 00:11:56.300
on a prominent British
naval historian who

00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:58.000
does call it a conspiracy.

00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.500
And he actually had a change
of heart, frankly, early on.

00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:03.750
This historian-- who in
fact was a former member

00:12:03.750 --> 00:12:06.050
of British Naval Intelligence.

00:12:06.050 --> 00:12:11.280
Early on, he had said in a
book that sort of glancingly

00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.460
dealt with it, he
said that the failure

00:12:13.460 --> 00:12:16.820
to do more with the intelligence
with regard to the "Lusitania"

00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:19.544
was, as he put it, a
monumental cock up.

00:12:19.544 --> 00:12:21.210
But then later in
life, as more evidence

00:12:21.210 --> 00:12:22.760
emerged, in an
interview that is now

00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:25.650
on file in the Imperial
War Museum in London,

00:12:25.650 --> 00:12:26.830
something very telling.

00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:30.232
He says, you know,
as much as I love--

00:12:30.232 --> 00:12:32.690
this is him speaking-- he says,
as much as I love the Royal

00:12:32.690 --> 00:12:37.857
Navy, he says, I've come to
feel that there was a plot.

00:12:37.857 --> 00:12:39.190
I don't know where it came from.

00:12:39.190 --> 00:12:42.600
I don't know who was
the originator, he says,

00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:44.200
but there had to be a plot.

00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:46.850
Then he says, if there
wasn't, would somebody

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:49.620
please tell me otherwise?

00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:52.910
So I hang it on him, because
there is no smoking memo.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.270
However, there is
this accumulation

00:12:55.270 --> 00:13:01.630
of really interesting evidence
about-- the "Lusitania"

00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:03.740
was essentially left
completely unprotected.

00:13:03.740 --> 00:13:05.910
Even though everybody
knew this ship was coming.

00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:12.110
It was foremost in the, sort
of, thinking of the world,

00:13:12.110 --> 00:13:12.610
if you will.

00:13:12.610 --> 00:13:15.450
Because of the warning
placed in the papers.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:17.820
Because of a variety of things.

00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:20.200
And here it was left
completely unprotected.

00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:23.460
There's so much
evidence on one side,

00:13:23.460 --> 00:13:25.840
saying this might
have been deliberate.

00:13:25.840 --> 00:13:29.090
But if you were to try to use
this evidence in a court of law

00:13:29.090 --> 00:13:32.185
to prove beyond a shadow of a
doubt that that was, in fact,

00:13:32.185 --> 00:13:34.590
a conspiracy, you couldn't.

00:13:34.590 --> 00:13:35.400
You couldn't.

00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:37.872
However, if you do the Newell
hypothesis, what scientists,

00:13:37.872 --> 00:13:39.830
you know, when you're
trying to prove something

00:13:39.830 --> 00:13:41.320
by disproving it.

00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:43.540
If you try to take the
same body of information

00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.329
and prove that there
was not a conspiracy,

00:13:46.329 --> 00:13:47.370
you can't do that either.

00:13:47.370 --> 00:13:48.050
SPEAKER: I see.

00:13:48.050 --> 00:13:48.990
ERIK LARSON: Can't
do that either.

00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:49.400
SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:13:49.400 --> 00:13:49.850
Thank you for--

00:13:49.850 --> 00:13:51.808
ERIK LARSON: But the
thing that remains though,

00:13:51.808 --> 00:13:57.620
is that for whatever
reason, on that May 7, 1915,

00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:00.572
this "Lusitania,"
packed with passengers,

00:14:00.572 --> 00:14:02.530
with everybody aware that
this ship was coming,

00:14:02.530 --> 00:14:07.440
with vast amounts of information
in the hands of the Admiralty,

00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:09.700
nothing was done to protect it.

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:12.719
SPEAKER: Would you go into
why that might have been?

00:14:12.719 --> 00:14:14.010
ERIK LARSON: I wish I knew why.

00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:15.220
I wish I knew why.

00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.280
That's one of the
enduring secrets.

00:14:18.280 --> 00:14:23.555
The captain of the ship
was never told about U-20.

00:14:23.555 --> 00:14:28.850
About U-20's expected
arrival off Liverpool.

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:31.320
He was never told that
nightly, at midnight,

00:14:31.320 --> 00:14:35.290
the big German
transmitter at Norddeich

00:14:35.290 --> 00:14:39.290
routinely broadcast the comings
and goings of the "Lusitania"

00:14:39.290 --> 00:14:41.860
and sister ships from Cunard.

00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:44.060
Nor was the captain
even informed

00:14:44.060 --> 00:14:47.420
of the three sinkings that
had occurred in short order

00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.210
before his ship was attacked.

00:14:50.210 --> 00:14:53.940
Information that, by then, had
already been in the newspapers

00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:54.877
in Liverpool.

00:14:54.877 --> 00:14:55.960
In the morning newspapers.

00:14:55.960 --> 00:15:03.060
And when the chairman of
the Cunard Steamship Company

00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:06.190
was having breakfast
the morning of Friday,

00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:12.360
May 7, he read in the newspapers
about these other ships.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:16.790
And instantly stops
having breakfast,

00:15:16.790 --> 00:15:19.560
goes to the Office of the Chief
Naval Officer in Liverpool

00:15:19.560 --> 00:15:21.460
and says, look, you've
got to do something.

00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:24.750
The "Lusitania" is coming.

00:15:24.750 --> 00:15:26.320
You've got to warn them.

00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.380
You know?

00:15:27.380 --> 00:15:31.960
And then there was a very
sort of generic, pale thing

00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.990
sent to Turner, but nothing
that at all described

00:15:36.990 --> 00:15:39.390
the true danger the
captain was facing.

00:15:39.390 --> 00:15:40.650
SPEAKER: Enduring mystery.

00:15:40.650 --> 00:15:42.170
ERIK LARSON: Enduring mystery.

00:15:42.170 --> 00:15:44.792
And it's not that,
frankly, it's not

00:15:44.792 --> 00:15:46.000
that huge a part of the book.

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.650
The book, really,
the point of the book

00:15:47.650 --> 00:15:53.330
is to really try to bring
to life the human dimension

00:15:53.330 --> 00:15:53.880
of the thing.

00:15:53.880 --> 00:15:56.930
I mean, the thing
that, in addition

00:15:56.930 --> 00:15:59.850
to just the details, that
kind of lit my imagination.

00:15:59.850 --> 00:16:03.370
The thing also, was, that
drew me to the project,

00:16:03.370 --> 00:16:09.056
was that in my first
exploratory visit to an archive.

00:16:09.056 --> 00:16:11.305
Which, actually, was down
here at Stanford University,

00:16:11.305 --> 00:16:14.000
at the Hoover Institution.

00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.010
I became aware-- they have a
modest "Lusitania" collection.

00:16:17.010 --> 00:16:19.460
There are vast resources in
the United Kingdom, which

00:16:19.460 --> 00:16:22.890
I tapped for this book, but
very early on in the process,

00:16:22.890 --> 00:16:25.730
it gave me a sense of
something that I had not

00:16:25.730 --> 00:16:27.070
I had any of my previous books.

00:16:27.070 --> 00:16:29.450
And that was the
depth, and richness,

00:16:29.450 --> 00:16:32.450
and texture of the
material available

00:16:32.450 --> 00:16:36.130
about the "Lusitania,"
seemed to offer me

00:16:36.130 --> 00:16:38.790
a whole new opportunity
to tell the story.

00:16:38.790 --> 00:16:40.840
To essentially put on
my Alfred Hitchcock hat,

00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:47.630
and tell the story in as
suspenseful a way as possible.

00:16:47.630 --> 00:16:49.770
In a way that would
put us, hopefully,

00:16:49.770 --> 00:16:52.530
readers on the ship, and
experience what the people

00:16:52.530 --> 00:16:53.780
there were experiencing.

00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:58.610
But with, and I guess it's sort
of hard to convey it, but just

00:16:58.610 --> 00:17:00.030
the texture of the material.

00:17:00.030 --> 00:17:04.970
From telegrams, to the war log
of the submarine commander,

00:17:04.970 --> 00:17:08.839
which was eventually found
and translated by German Naval

00:17:08.839 --> 00:17:12.329
Intelligence, which tells
exactly what happened

00:17:12.329 --> 00:17:15.720
in that entire dismal patrol
that that submarine commander

00:17:15.720 --> 00:17:18.109
took, from the day he
left Germany, to the day

00:17:18.109 --> 00:17:18.650
he came back.

00:17:18.650 --> 00:17:21.220
Including narrative
passages about being chased

00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:24.250
by destroyers, horrible
weather, failed

00:17:24.250 --> 00:17:26.180
torpedoes, the whole deal.

00:17:26.180 --> 00:17:28.400
And so all this stuff
taught me that I

00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.850
could tell this story
in a very different way.

00:17:30.850 --> 00:17:34.580
And that's the thing that made
me finally pull that trigger.

00:17:34.580 --> 00:17:35.401
SPEAKER: Wonderful.

00:17:35.401 --> 00:17:37.900
I probably couldn't have asked
for a more perfect transition

00:17:37.900 --> 00:17:40.150
to the second of two themes
I kind of wanted to cover,

00:17:40.150 --> 00:17:42.125
which are the characters.

00:17:42.125 --> 00:17:44.500
Now, this is obviously
not a work of fiction,

00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:47.970
but I found virtually
every character

00:17:47.970 --> 00:17:51.210
that you dive into,
to be so complex.

00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:51.772
So human.

00:17:51.772 --> 00:17:53.230
I don't want to
steal your thunder,

00:17:53.230 --> 00:17:56.260
but I want to just briefly share
the two favorites that I had.

00:17:56.260 --> 00:18:00.190
And we will talk a little bit
about the Captain and Commander

00:18:00.190 --> 00:18:03.030
of U-boat 20, and
the "Lusitania."

00:18:03.030 --> 00:18:07.690
But before them, The first
is a certain Dwight Harris.

00:18:07.690 --> 00:18:09.990
So Dwight is leaving New York.

00:18:09.990 --> 00:18:12.690
And, I guess, compared
to the other passengers

00:18:12.690 --> 00:18:14.600
who just seem to be
getting on the ship,

00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.730
he seems a little cautious.

00:18:15.730 --> 00:18:17.320
A little hesitant.

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:19.670
And so before the
voyage, he goes and buys

00:18:19.670 --> 00:18:24.460
a personal custom Wanamaker
life belt for himself.

00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:27.080
Which, to me, seems akin
to getting a personal life

00:18:27.080 --> 00:18:28.893
preserver before I
hop onto an airplane.

00:18:28.893 --> 00:18:29.726
ERIK LARSON: It was.

00:18:29.726 --> 00:18:30.917
It was, yeah.

00:18:30.917 --> 00:18:32.250
SPEAKER: So he gets on the ship.

00:18:32.250 --> 00:18:34.690
And even as he gets
on, he's thinking.

00:18:34.690 --> 00:18:35.470
He's analyzing.

00:18:35.470 --> 00:18:37.790
He decides, if this
thing is going down,

00:18:37.790 --> 00:18:39.680
the departing the
ship at the bow.

00:18:39.680 --> 00:18:42.150
And sure enough,
after the attack,

00:18:42.150 --> 00:18:45.171
he thinks, do I have time to
go get my custom Wanamaker

00:18:45.171 --> 00:18:45.670
lifebelt?

00:18:45.670 --> 00:18:46.169
Nope.

00:18:46.169 --> 00:18:48.210
OK, I'm going to go jump.

00:18:48.210 --> 00:18:50.935
He goes a couple decks
down, he's about to-- oh,

00:18:50.935 --> 00:18:53.500
and before he
jumps, he's offered

00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.220
to enter a lifeboat
that's half empty,

00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.780
but he thinks, no,
those are going

00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:58.990
to be some really in demand
spots in the lifeboat,

00:18:58.990 --> 00:19:00.080
I'm going to jump.

00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:00.860
Sees the water.

00:19:00.860 --> 00:19:02.450
Says, I'd better
get my lifebelt.

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:04.290
Goes and gets his lifebelt.

00:19:04.290 --> 00:19:06.290
And then he hangs over
the rail of the ship

00:19:06.290 --> 00:19:09.560
and waits for the water
to catch up to his feet,

00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:10.886
and dives into the ocean.

00:19:10.886 --> 00:19:12.600
Now you do a wonderful job.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.230
We leave him for a moment.

00:19:14.230 --> 00:19:15.470
We talk about other people.

00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:18.890
The next time we see
our friend Dwight,

00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.332
he is passing by
a lifeboat that's

00:19:21.332 --> 00:19:23.790
empty except for two crewmen,
I believe, who were on board.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:25.064
ERIK LARSON: Right.

00:19:25.064 --> 00:19:27.230
SPEAKER: Something like six
out of all the lifeboats

00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:28.563
actually make it into the water.

00:19:28.563 --> 00:19:31.950
If you find a lifeboat with
only two crew professionals

00:19:31.950 --> 00:19:33.650
on board, you get in.

00:19:33.650 --> 00:19:36.180
And he waves them off
and goes for a swim.

00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:37.710
ERIK LARSON: Right,
right, right.

00:19:37.710 --> 00:19:40.810
Well, now I'm not going to
reveal any more about Dwight

00:19:40.810 --> 00:19:42.990
Harris, because I don't
want to give it all away,

00:19:42.990 --> 00:19:45.930
but Dwight Harris was, in
fact, my favorite character.

00:19:45.930 --> 00:19:48.320
For the main reason being
that, well, first of all,

00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:51.320
I love the fact that
he was thinking ahead,

00:19:51.320 --> 00:19:55.880
and went shopping for
his own life preserver.

00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.480
I thought that was very cool.

00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.440
But what I really liked
about Dwight Harris,

00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.980
was the fact that in
this lengthy letter

00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:06.480
that-- the reason we know about
all this, about Dwight Harris,

00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:11.240
is because he wrote a very long,
very good letter to his mother

00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.915
afterwards.

00:20:12.915 --> 00:20:14.540
Anybody who's in this
book, by the way,

00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:18.470
is in there because they left
a very detailed record somehow.

00:20:18.470 --> 00:20:21.637
But what I love
most about Dwight,

00:20:21.637 --> 00:20:23.970
you know, he's on his way,
he's got his engagement ring,

00:20:23.970 --> 00:20:25.630
he's going to get
married in England,

00:20:25.630 --> 00:20:30.380
or at least ask his
girlfriend to get married.

00:20:30.380 --> 00:20:32.640
But he's just so full of
enthusiasm in this letter,

00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:33.965
having survived this disaster.

00:20:33.965 --> 00:20:38.240
I mean, every other sentence
has multiple exclamation points.

00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:40.290
So enthusiastic, not
just of having survived,

00:20:40.290 --> 00:20:44.210
but also having been a big
part of this-- not a big part--

00:20:44.210 --> 00:20:47.420
of having been part of this
immense historical disaster.

00:20:47.420 --> 00:20:49.787
So that's why I just love--
he had to be in the book.

00:20:49.787 --> 00:20:51.745
And he's not even the
most prominent character.

00:20:51.745 --> 00:20:53.789
SPEAKER: No, he's a minor
character, relatively.

00:20:53.789 --> 00:20:54.580
He's your favorite.

00:20:54.580 --> 00:20:57.640
Is he the one you
most identified with?

00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.160
ERIK LARSON: Most
identified with?

00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:02.440
I don't know who identified
with most, frankly.

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:04.300
I can't say that really
identified with him.

00:21:04.300 --> 00:21:06.300
I can't say that I really
identify with anybody,

00:21:06.300 --> 00:21:09.370
except maybe the
submarine commander.

00:21:09.370 --> 00:21:10.710
Shouldn't?

00:21:10.710 --> 00:21:11.512
I mean, yeah.

00:21:11.512 --> 00:21:12.970
I mean the commander,
we were going

00:21:12.970 --> 00:21:14.020
to talk about that
a little bit later.

00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:16.689
I don't want to jump the
gun, but maybe I will anyway.

00:21:16.689 --> 00:21:18.980
But you know, the thing about
the submarine commander--

00:21:18.980 --> 00:21:19.710
SPEAKER: That's a
wonderful transition.

00:21:19.710 --> 00:21:20.880
Yeah, please, yeah.

00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.940
ERIK LARSON: That was one
of the surprises to me.

00:21:22.940 --> 00:21:25.065
You know, when I got into
this book I was thinking,

00:21:25.065 --> 00:21:28.370
god, you know, I sure hope
this guy has, like a huge scar

00:21:28.370 --> 00:21:30.720
on his face and wears a
monocle and the whole deal.

00:21:30.720 --> 00:21:31.220
Right?

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:32.555
But no.

00:21:32.555 --> 00:21:35.730
I mean, this guy was
a 30-year-old guy,

00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:39.315
handsome, blue eyes,
charismatic, charming.

00:21:39.315 --> 00:21:42.130
The kind of guy you'd want to
go out and get a beer with.

00:21:42.130 --> 00:21:42.660
You know?

00:21:42.660 --> 00:21:44.390
And his crew loved him.

00:21:44.390 --> 00:21:49.310
One time he had six dachshunds
aboard his submarine.

00:21:49.310 --> 00:21:52.330
Two parents and four puppies.

00:21:52.330 --> 00:21:54.835
And his crew loved him.

00:21:54.835 --> 00:21:58.090
A fellow commander said
of him, after the war,

00:21:58.090 --> 00:22:00.220
said he couldn't hurt a fly.

00:22:00.220 --> 00:22:01.430
Couldn't hurt a fly.

00:22:01.430 --> 00:22:04.880
You know, history kind
of proves the opposite.

00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:06.333
But I really kind
of-- I can't say

00:22:06.333 --> 00:22:10.870
that I identified with the
submarine commander-- that

00:22:10.870 --> 00:22:14.260
would be an awful thing to
have stamped on my resume--

00:22:14.260 --> 00:22:21.930
but he was a surprisingly
compelling and sympathetic

00:22:21.930 --> 00:22:22.510
character.

00:22:22.510 --> 00:22:24.320
And I'm a little
troubled by the fact

00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:26.196
that-- am I allowed
to mention Twitter?

00:22:26.196 --> 00:22:27.570
I'm a little
troubled by the fact

00:22:27.570 --> 00:22:31.490
that now that I'm on
Twitter, and I hear things

00:22:31.490 --> 00:22:34.990
from readers-- often things
I don't want to hear--

00:22:34.990 --> 00:22:36.490
but I hear things from readers.

00:22:36.490 --> 00:22:38.820
And one of the things that
I find very fascinating

00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.690
is that quite a few have
told me that as they're

00:22:41.690 --> 00:22:43.920
reading the book, they
find themselves rooting

00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.140
for the submarine commander.

00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.790
That's kind of appalling.

00:22:48.790 --> 00:22:51.667
But maybe understanding, also.

00:22:51.667 --> 00:22:53.500
SPEAKER: Thank you for
sharing that context.

00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:59.300
I think prior to, I think,
day three of U-20's mission,

00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:02.370
we get that sense of Schwieger.

00:23:02.370 --> 00:23:05.880
He takes the submarine to
the bottom on Christmas Day

00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:08.160
so they can have
a big music party.

00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:13.780
Yeah, he rescues the dogs from
another vessel that he sinks.

00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:17.200
One that struck me, is he saw
a horse jumping into the ocean,

00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:19.640
after sinking a vessel,
and he orders a dive,

00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:21.390
stops looking at the
periscope, because he

00:23:21.390 --> 00:23:22.360
couldn't bear to watch.

00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:23.109
ERIK LARSON: Yeah.

00:23:23.109 --> 00:23:26.350
SPEAKER: Things changed
for me on day three, where,

00:23:26.350 --> 00:23:29.701
I think, the first boat he comes
across, I think it has sails.

00:23:29.701 --> 00:23:30.950
There's like six men on board.

00:23:30.950 --> 00:23:32.190
It's a fishing vessel.

00:23:32.190 --> 00:23:33.189
ERIK LARSON: Yeah, yeah.

00:23:33.189 --> 00:23:35.174
SPEAKER: Why is he
sinking these boats?

00:23:35.174 --> 00:23:37.340
ERIK LARSON: Well, you know,
it's all about tonnage.

00:23:37.340 --> 00:23:38.215
SPEAKER: That's true.

00:23:38.215 --> 00:23:39.890
ERIK LARSON: It was
a game of tonnage.

00:23:39.890 --> 00:23:44.230
It didn't matter what you sank,
the point was to sink things.

00:23:44.230 --> 00:23:46.990
And among the German
submarine commanders,

00:23:46.990 --> 00:23:50.079
the point was to accumulate
as much tonnage as possible.

00:23:50.079 --> 00:23:51.620
That was the way
you got to the point

00:23:51.620 --> 00:23:54.170
where you would be
considered a submarine ace,

00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:56.120
and receive your reward.

00:23:56.120 --> 00:23:57.640
Your honors.

00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:59.150
And so it didn't matter.

00:23:59.150 --> 00:24:00.330
It didn't matter.

00:24:00.330 --> 00:24:03.530
Now, he would have preferred
to sink something much larger.

00:24:03.530 --> 00:24:07.430
And it was also,
actually, smaller vessels

00:24:07.430 --> 00:24:10.450
allowed him to use
his deck gun, which

00:24:10.450 --> 00:24:16.440
was his preferred
method of sinking ships

00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.905
below a certain size, because
the deck gun was reliable.

00:24:21.905 --> 00:24:26.640
He had, like 300 shells in
his armory on the submarine.

00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:31.690
The deck gun-- his gunnery crew
was deadly accurate and fast.

00:24:31.690 --> 00:24:35.990
And so he knew he had
a lot of assurance

00:24:35.990 --> 00:24:38.650
that when they fired a shell,
it would strike and blow up.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:41.590
He did not have that
assurance with torpedoes.

00:24:41.590 --> 00:24:44.450
The German Navy
did its own tally,

00:24:44.450 --> 00:24:47.720
and found that 60%
of torpedo firings

00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.920
failed for one
reason or another.

00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.480
And Schwieger himself
had that experience

00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:56.950
on this patrol, which makes it
actually even more remarkable

00:24:56.950 --> 00:25:00.410
that he actually did manage
to sink the "Lusitania."

00:25:00.410 --> 00:25:02.410
SPEAKER: He's
conflicting character,

00:25:02.410 --> 00:25:04.160
or conflicted character.

00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:06.989
ERIK LARSON: He wasn't
conflicted, but he's nuanced.

00:25:06.989 --> 00:25:07.530
He's nuanced.

00:25:07.530 --> 00:25:08.280
SPEAKER: He is.

00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:09.100
ERIK LARSON: Let's say that.

00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:09.870
SPEAKER: Absolutely.

00:25:09.870 --> 00:25:11.953
There's more-- I don't
want to give too much away,

00:25:11.953 --> 00:25:13.510
I'm sure you don't either.

00:25:13.510 --> 00:25:17.611
One more thing on
U-20 and the crew,

00:25:17.611 --> 00:25:19.360
one more character I'm
going to highlight,

00:25:19.360 --> 00:25:23.050
is a squat fishermen with a
giant flaring red beard who

00:25:23.050 --> 00:25:24.970
was a great accordion player.

00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.370
He looked like a gnome,
could neither read nor write,

00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.470
but apparently had an
appeal to the opposite sex,

00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:33.359
because Schwieger gets multiple
letters from different women

00:25:33.359 --> 00:25:34.650
saying, let this guy come home.

00:25:34.650 --> 00:25:35.570
I have to marry him.

00:25:35.570 --> 00:25:36.110
ERIK LARSON: Right, right.

00:25:36.110 --> 00:25:38.310
SPEAKER: What made you want
to explore the U-20 crew

00:25:38.310 --> 00:25:39.260
and talk about
their [INAUDIBLE]?

00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:41.135
ERIK LARSON: Oh, it's
just part of the story.

00:25:43.910 --> 00:25:48.560
Once I realized the detail
that was in the submarine's war

00:25:48.560 --> 00:25:51.800
log, this chronicle
of its entire journey,

00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:53.950
I knew immediately what
the structure of the book

00:25:53.950 --> 00:25:54.460
was going to be.

00:25:54.460 --> 00:25:55.876
It was going to
be the convergence

00:25:55.876 --> 00:25:58.490
of the ship and the submarine.

00:25:58.490 --> 00:26:02.440
I mean, that's the logical
suspenseful convergence.

00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:05.450
And so, you know, the context
was very, very important.

00:26:05.450 --> 00:26:08.060
You had to get to know
some of the crew-- I mean,

00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.300
to the extent that you can.

00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:15.750
I mean, the record of who
was aboard was not that rich.

00:26:15.750 --> 00:26:18.150
But there are
accounts available.

00:26:18.150 --> 00:26:21.960
And there are people who were
interviewed after the war.

00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:24.080
And so, you know,
I felt it was just

00:26:24.080 --> 00:26:26.424
absolutely necessary to have
a good sense of what life

00:26:26.424 --> 00:26:27.715
was like aboard that submarine.

00:26:27.715 --> 00:26:28.902
You know?

00:26:28.902 --> 00:26:29.600
SPEAKER: I do.

00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:34.050
And speaking of which, the whole
time I'm reading about the set

00:26:34.050 --> 00:26:37.930
up this U-boat, and
I'm hearing about

00:26:37.930 --> 00:26:39.790
these primitive submarines.

00:26:39.790 --> 00:26:40.850
The U-boat sweat.

00:26:40.850 --> 00:26:42.560
Do you want to talk
about U-boat sweat?

00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:45.230
ERIK LARSON: Well, U-boat
sweat was, like this,

00:26:45.230 --> 00:26:48.520
because of condensate on
the walls of the interior

00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:49.290
of the submarine.

00:26:49.290 --> 00:26:52.590
And whenever it was underwater,
it would get extremely warm.

00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:55.600
And it was just like
this oily moist thing

00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:57.130
dripping into your coffee.

00:26:57.130 --> 00:27:04.700
And you're just living in this
miasma of heat and diesel oil

00:27:04.700 --> 00:27:05.530
and moisture.

00:27:05.530 --> 00:27:07.030
And then, of course,
you add to that

00:27:07.030 --> 00:27:09.500
the fact that there was only
one lavatory, which did not

00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:10.780
have very good ventilation.

00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:15.090
Then you add 36 guys wearing
leather seasuits day in,

00:27:15.090 --> 00:27:16.009
day out.

00:27:16.009 --> 00:27:17.800
Never changing, because
what was the point?

00:27:17.800 --> 00:27:20.897
They had to be ready at a
moment's notice to get up.

00:27:20.897 --> 00:27:23.480
That was, really, just sort of,
to me, it was like, oh my god,

00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.404
what a horror.

00:27:24.404 --> 00:27:26.320
And yet, it was one of
the most coveted things

00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:29.814
for young German Naval
officers, sailors to do,

00:27:29.814 --> 00:27:31.230
was to join the
submarine service.

00:27:31.230 --> 00:27:35.190
Because you were
assured of action.

00:27:35.190 --> 00:27:37.582
And the other thing that
kind of surprised me

00:27:37.582 --> 00:27:39.040
about the submarines--
these German

00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:40.850
submarines-- they
weren't particularly

00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:42.710
good at being underwater.

00:27:42.710 --> 00:27:45.600
They could only stay under
a relatively brief time.

00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.060
They traveled very slowly
when underwater-- nine knots

00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:50.560
was their maximum speed.

00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:53.270
And in fact, when Schwieger
was chased by destroyers,

00:27:53.270 --> 00:27:57.230
he came very near to having to
surface-- which would have been

00:27:57.230 --> 00:28:00.595
almost certain death-- because
he'd stayed underwater to long,

00:28:00.595 --> 00:28:03.410
his batteries were crackling.

00:28:03.410 --> 00:28:06.617
And he would have been
blown out of the water

00:28:06.617 --> 00:28:07.450
by those destroyers.

00:28:07.450 --> 00:28:09.520
Because as accurate as
his own gunners were,

00:28:09.520 --> 00:28:12.345
the British Naval gunners
on destroyers were amazing.

00:28:12.345 --> 00:28:15.680
They could blow a submarine out
of the water from a mile away.

00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.430
SPEAKER: I think you
answered the question

00:28:17.430 --> 00:28:21.640
that I was getting to, which
was, why would anybody want

00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.460
to be a submariner at the time?

00:28:25.460 --> 00:28:28.360
I mean, we even didn't
talk about U-boat baptisms,

00:28:28.360 --> 00:28:29.495
and whatnot.

00:28:29.495 --> 00:28:30.870
I don't know if
you want to say--

00:28:30.870 --> 00:28:32.460
ERIK LARSON: Well,
it's up to you.

00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:34.460
What kind of audience are
we talking about here?

00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:35.280
SPEAKER: I think it's a pretty--

00:28:35.280 --> 00:28:36.654
ERIK LARSON: A
U-boat baptism was

00:28:36.654 --> 00:28:41.950
when you, on a U-boat, if you
flushed the john, essentially,

00:28:41.950 --> 00:28:45.940
at a point where the pressure
was it was too high below,

00:28:45.940 --> 00:28:51.140
you got a face full of what you
just deposited in that john.

00:28:51.140 --> 00:28:54.195
And it was called a U-boat
baptism for naive officers

00:28:54.195 --> 00:28:56.686
who were new to a submarine.

00:28:56.686 --> 00:28:58.560
SPEAKER: And so is that--
is it the prestige?

00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:01.212
Is it the guarantee
of seeing action

00:29:01.212 --> 00:29:02.420
that's what drives these men?

00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:04.940
ERIK LARSON: Yeah, is was the
guarantee of seeing action.

00:29:04.940 --> 00:29:09.340
It was being seen to be heroic.

00:29:09.340 --> 00:29:10.793
But mostly is was the action.

00:29:10.793 --> 00:29:16.590
It was strange, the members
of the actual surface fleet--

00:29:16.590 --> 00:29:18.470
as mighty as the
German surface fleet

00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:23.920
was-- the German Navy,
for the most part,

00:29:23.920 --> 00:29:25.320
kept that fleet in port.

00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:27.730
And it became sort of a
subject of some mockery

00:29:27.730 --> 00:29:29.220
within the Germany
Navy, especially

00:29:29.220 --> 00:29:33.355
on the part of submariners,
about keeping the fleet safe

00:29:33.355 --> 00:29:35.380
for-- you know.

00:29:35.380 --> 00:29:38.320
So yeah, the submarine was
a very appealing place,

00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:41.060
not because of the lifestyle,
but because of what it could

00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.925
do for you in your
career, and because you

00:29:42.925 --> 00:29:44.120
were helping your country.

00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.380
SPEAKER: I see.

00:29:45.380 --> 00:29:47.142
What surprised you
most in the research,

00:29:47.142 --> 00:29:49.100
or do you find conflicting
information that you

00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:49.950
had to really think about?

00:29:49.950 --> 00:29:51.520
ERIK LARSON: Well, what
surprised me most--

00:29:51.520 --> 00:29:52.853
I mean, everything surprised me.

00:29:52.853 --> 00:29:55.100
I mean Room 40, the whole deal.

00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:57.740
But I think, actually, one of
the first and earliest things

00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:02.200
to really surprise me was
just the fact that I had been,

00:30:02.200 --> 00:30:07.750
personally, I had shared a
vast misconception, which

00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.550
was that the Lusitania
was the World War I

00:30:10.550 --> 00:30:12.720
equivalent of Pearl Harbor.

00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:17.080
And that no sooner was the ship
sunk, than, boom were at war.

00:30:17.080 --> 00:30:20.421
And that is not what happened.

00:30:20.421 --> 00:30:22.170
As I was doing the
research for this book,

00:30:22.170 --> 00:30:25.350
I would ask friends
and family who

00:30:25.350 --> 00:30:27.946
knew what I was working on--
and that's not a lot of people,

00:30:27.946 --> 00:30:29.710
because I generally
keep it pretty quiet,

00:30:29.710 --> 00:30:30.543
what I'm working on.

00:30:30.543 --> 00:30:32.260
But I would ask
them, I would say,

00:30:32.260 --> 00:30:34.093
so how long do you think
it was between when

00:30:34.093 --> 00:30:36.960
the ship got torpedoed and
when we got into World War I?

00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:39.970
And the estimates ranged
from two days to two months.

00:30:39.970 --> 00:30:41.120
Two days to two months.

00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:45.110
But in fact, it
was two full years.

00:30:45.110 --> 00:30:47.840
And not only two full years, but
when President Wilson finally

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.060
asked Congress for a declaration
of war-- or actually,

00:30:51.060 --> 00:30:53.750
to be more precise, a
declaration that a state of war

00:30:53.750 --> 00:30:56.659
already existed with Germany.

00:30:56.659 --> 00:30:58.200
When he asked for
that from Congress,

00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.150
he never once mentioned
the "Lusitania,"

00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:03.920
because so many other things
had happened in the interim,

00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:06.436
including the sinking of
actual American flag ships.

00:31:06.436 --> 00:31:08.310
The "Lusitania," remember,
was a British ship

00:31:08.310 --> 00:31:11.770
that happened to have
American passengers on board.

00:31:11.770 --> 00:31:13.800
But between the time of
the sinking and the time

00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:18.052
we got into the war, a number
of American ships were sunk.

00:31:18.052 --> 00:31:20.260
And then, of course, there
was the infamous Zimmerman

00:31:20.260 --> 00:31:23.810
telegram, which was the thing
that really finally flipped

00:31:23.810 --> 00:31:25.060
the switch.

00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:27.840
When Germany offered
Mexico an alliance,

00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:31.140
and in return for
Mexico's participation,

00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.640
Germany would do all it could
to help Mexico recoup New Mexico

00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:37.680
and Texas.

00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:40.500
Them's fighting
words for America.

00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:42.440
And that's what really
got us into the war.

00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:43.880
So that was a real
surprise to me.

00:31:43.880 --> 00:31:45.250
I mean, again, it
goes back to what

00:31:45.250 --> 00:31:46.270
you were taught in high school.

00:31:46.270 --> 00:31:46.575
You know?

00:31:46.575 --> 00:31:46.880
Boom.

00:31:46.880 --> 00:31:48.088
Ship sinks, we're in the war.

00:31:48.088 --> 00:31:48.870
That's all I knew.

00:31:48.870 --> 00:31:51.550
That's all I knew before
I got into the story.

00:31:51.550 --> 00:31:53.832
SPEAKER: I think that was
my perception as well.

00:31:53.832 --> 00:31:56.040
Why don't we turn it over,
if anybody in the audience

00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:56.695
has any questions.

00:31:56.695 --> 00:31:57.694
ERIK LARSON: Yeah, sure.

00:31:57.694 --> 00:32:00.151
You can ask me anything
except one question.

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:01.835
AUDIENCE: [INAUDIBLE]?

00:32:01.835 --> 00:32:03.210
ERIK LARSON: That's
the question.

00:32:03.210 --> 00:32:04.359
No.

00:32:04.359 --> 00:32:05.900
You can't ask me
what I'm working on,

00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:07.399
because I'm not
working on anything,

00:32:07.399 --> 00:32:08.599
and it gets me very upset.

00:32:08.599 --> 00:32:10.140
AUDIENCE: Could you
talk a little bit

00:32:10.140 --> 00:32:14.630
about Churchill changing
the rules of engagement?

00:32:14.630 --> 00:32:16.290
ERIK LARSON: Well,
it wasn't Churchill

00:32:16.290 --> 00:32:17.180
who changed the
rules of engagement,

00:32:17.180 --> 00:32:18.550
it was the German
Navy that changed

00:32:18.550 --> 00:32:19.590
the rules of engagement.

00:32:19.590 --> 00:32:27.330
Churchill was one of the early
doubters about the submarine.

00:32:27.330 --> 00:32:33.470
And actually, there was a guy
in the Admiralty, Jacky Fisher,

00:32:33.470 --> 00:32:34.850
who was Churchill's number two.

00:32:34.850 --> 00:32:37.940
And he was one of
a couple of people

00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:45.350
who foresaw the actual impact
of the submarine, which

00:32:45.350 --> 00:32:47.467
was a very, very new thing.

00:32:47.467 --> 00:32:49.050
And in a paper that
he wrote, he would

00:32:49.050 --> 00:32:51.650
forecast that
submarines would be

00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:55.310
used to sink ships without
warning, sink merchant ships,

00:32:55.310 --> 00:32:55.860
and so forth.

00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:57.347
Churchill rejected
that completely.

00:32:57.347 --> 00:32:59.430
He thought, no, this is
too incredible to believe.

00:32:59.430 --> 00:33:01.500
Nobody's going to do that.

00:33:01.500 --> 00:33:03.540
So it was Germany that
changed the rules,

00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.790
and it was the submarine
that was the fulcrum

00:33:05.790 --> 00:33:07.730
for that change of rules.

00:33:07.730 --> 00:33:09.910
And then one thing
led to another,

00:33:09.910 --> 00:33:12.450
and everybody was
changing the rules.

00:33:12.450 --> 00:33:14.890
AUDIENCE: I think there was
one rule that got changed,

00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.680
which was the
firing over the bow,

00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:20.794
and that that usually
would stop a ship.

00:33:20.794 --> 00:33:22.460
ERIK LARSON: Well
that went out the door

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.100
before anybody even said boo.

00:33:24.100 --> 00:33:27.300
I mean, that was one of
the old cruiser rules,

00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:31.440
or the so-called
prize law rules.

00:33:31.440 --> 00:33:34.090
The whole point of
those-- those rules

00:33:34.090 --> 00:33:38.720
had been in place for
essentially 100 or more years,

00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:46.400
governing how military ships
could engage civilian ships.

00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.970
At all times, the crews and
passengers of those ships

00:33:48.970 --> 00:33:51.500
had to be kept safe--
these are the old rules--

00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.210
they had to be kept safe.

00:33:53.210 --> 00:33:55.830
Passenger ships, you could not
even attack a passenger ship.

00:33:55.830 --> 00:33:58.070
That was forbidden.

00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:01.260
And those were the rules that
the submarine and the German

00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:06.016
Navy essentially threw out
as of the spring of 1915.

00:34:06.016 --> 00:34:06.640
AUDIENCE: Cool.

00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.848
And I'm collecting some
questions from the Livestream

00:34:08.848 --> 00:34:11.464
here, we have one from
Hiram in the DC office.

00:34:11.464 --> 00:34:14.739
There were apparently spies
on board during the sinking.

00:34:14.739 --> 00:34:17.429
Was there any attempt to
capture or rescue them,

00:34:17.429 --> 00:34:19.855
or any narrative
from their escapades?

00:34:19.855 --> 00:34:24.480
ERIK LARSON: Yeah, there
were three German stowaways

00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.929
aboard the ship.

00:34:25.929 --> 00:34:29.940
Apparently, one had a camera.

00:34:29.940 --> 00:34:32.969
And they were quickly
discovered by the crew,

00:34:32.969 --> 00:34:35.190
and then they were
locked-- not in a brig,

00:34:35.190 --> 00:34:36.981
the ship didn't have
a brig-- but they were

00:34:36.981 --> 00:34:40.736
locked somewhere down below.

00:34:40.736 --> 00:34:42.360
And to the best of
anybody's knowledge,

00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:46.190
when the ship went down,
they were still locked below.

00:34:46.190 --> 00:34:48.734
What they were doing
aboard, nobody knows.

00:34:48.734 --> 00:34:50.150
There's speculation
that they were

00:34:50.150 --> 00:34:53.429
looking for evidence that the
ship was carrying munitions.

00:34:53.429 --> 00:34:53.975
It was.

00:34:53.975 --> 00:34:56.469
That was not a secret,
as much as people might

00:34:56.469 --> 00:34:58.970
like to think that it was.

00:34:58.970 --> 00:35:02.810
So anyway, that's
the story of that.

00:35:02.810 --> 00:35:06.820
AUDIENCE: How often does your
research for any of your books

00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.820
involve new material?

00:35:08.820 --> 00:35:11.290
And how often does
that new material

00:35:11.290 --> 00:35:14.820
change the conventional
narratives?

00:35:14.820 --> 00:35:17.620
ERIK LARSON: You know, in
every project that I do,

00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.760
to a lesser or greater extent,
there is new material that I

00:35:20.760 --> 00:35:23.830
come across.

00:35:23.830 --> 00:35:28.840
And often a new perception
that I bring to it, because I'm

00:35:28.840 --> 00:35:30.920
looking at it fresh.

00:35:30.920 --> 00:35:36.350
In the case of the
"Lusitania," the new,

00:35:36.350 --> 00:35:38.020
frankly, is the telling.

00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:42.670
Although, there are a lot
of new bits in the book.

00:35:42.670 --> 00:35:44.920
I mean, they're not going
to make newspaper headlines,

00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:46.926
but they're there.

00:35:46.926 --> 00:35:48.770
And I love coming across them.

00:35:48.770 --> 00:35:52.762
But that was one of things that
made me a little bit hesitant

00:35:52.762 --> 00:35:54.470
about doing a book
about the "Lusitania,"

00:35:54.470 --> 00:35:57.120
was the fact that it had,
obviously, been done before.

00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.888
But I did it best, thank you.

00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:03.150
AUDIENCE: So, I often
recommend your books

00:36:03.150 --> 00:36:05.340
to my friends that think
they don't like nonfiction,

00:36:05.340 --> 00:36:07.400
because they're so
engaging and so rich.

00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:10.050
And earlier you said you
don't like the term narrative

00:36:10.050 --> 00:36:10.740
nonfiction.

00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.540
Can you explain that
a little bit more?

00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.414
ERIK LARSON: Well, yeah, OK.

00:36:14.414 --> 00:36:16.830
It's because, well first of
all, I just don't like labels.

00:36:16.830 --> 00:36:17.800
I don't like labels.

00:36:17.800 --> 00:36:21.590
For example, I think one of the
most awful labels that apply

00:36:21.590 --> 00:36:24.020
to literature its chick lit.

00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:24.640
You know?

00:36:24.640 --> 00:36:26.810
Chick lit.

00:36:26.810 --> 00:36:32.629
And I think any kind of
label distorts perception.

00:36:32.629 --> 00:36:35.170
On the other hand, I don't know
what you'd call it otherwise,

00:36:35.170 --> 00:36:38.180
except just maybe good
nonfiction storytelling.

00:36:38.180 --> 00:36:42.541
So, it's my thing.

00:36:42.541 --> 00:36:44.290
Other people call it
immersion journalism.

00:36:44.290 --> 00:36:45.890
I hate that, although it's
very appropriate in terms

00:36:45.890 --> 00:36:46.750
of a sinking ship.

00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:51.680
And then the worst
of the worst, though,

00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.750
is what was applied to Truman
Capote's book "In Cold Blood."

00:36:54.750 --> 00:36:56.010
It's a great book.

00:36:56.010 --> 00:36:58.270
Although nobody really knows
exactly how much of that

00:36:58.270 --> 00:36:59.610
was real and how much not.

00:36:59.610 --> 00:37:02.750
Because he never left
footnotes, and it was, whatever.

00:37:02.750 --> 00:37:06.720
But that was referred to
by him, Capote himself

00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.840
called it a nonfiction novel,
which is like, bizarre.

00:37:09.840 --> 00:37:11.070
It's a novel, or it's not.

00:37:11.070 --> 00:37:11.670
You know?

00:37:11.670 --> 00:37:13.200
So I just don't like labels.

00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.370
I don't like labels.

00:37:15.370 --> 00:37:16.194
Thank you.

00:37:16.194 --> 00:37:17.360
Keep recommending the books.

00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.235
AUDIENCE: Definitely.

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:19.128
[LAUGHTER]

00:37:19.128 --> 00:37:20.586
AUDIENCE: Could
you talk about what

00:37:20.586 --> 00:37:23.490
your process is like for
research, writing, and editing?

00:37:23.490 --> 00:37:24.500
ERIK LARSON: Yeah, sure.

00:37:27.030 --> 00:37:31.070
It's incredibly neurotic
and anal, really.

00:37:31.070 --> 00:37:36.600
The research process, it begins
with parachuting into archives.

00:37:36.600 --> 00:37:40.640
I mean, I love archives.

00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.140
Every day is like
a detective story.

00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:44.280
And the way you do it
these days, you go in,

00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:46.130
you bring, of course--
nobody photocopies

00:37:46.130 --> 00:37:47.870
anymore-- you bring
in a digital camera

00:37:47.870 --> 00:37:50.620
and you photograph things.

00:37:50.620 --> 00:37:54.790
My MO-- well, for this
book, my wife and I--

00:37:54.790 --> 00:37:57.390
my wife was able to take a
sabbatical from her job--

00:37:57.390 --> 00:38:02.530
and we based ourselves
in Paris for six months.

00:38:02.530 --> 00:38:04.830
And so I could just take
the Chunnel to the UK.

00:38:04.830 --> 00:38:05.460
I hate to fly.

00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:06.272
I hate to fly.

00:38:06.272 --> 00:38:07.980
So I could just take
the Chunnel, and go.

00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:11.310
There's all these great
archives in the UK.

00:38:11.310 --> 00:38:15.440
My MO is to go for about a
week, plunge into, let's say,

00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:18.680
the National Archives
of the UK, at Kew.

00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:19.560
Plunge in.

00:38:19.560 --> 00:38:22.600
Photograph everything that
even looks remotely like it

00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:23.490
might be useful.

00:38:23.490 --> 00:38:24.960
I don't read the whole
thing while I'm there,

00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.620
because that could take
months, and I don't

00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:27.786
want to pay the hotel bills.

00:38:27.786 --> 00:38:30.170
You know what I mean?

00:38:30.170 --> 00:38:34.374
So I go in, I take,
you know, I mean I may,

00:38:34.374 --> 00:38:35.790
by the end of the
week, I may have

00:38:35.790 --> 00:38:40.340
1,500 photographs in my--
I'll fill up a memory card.

00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:43.320
And then when I get back to my
home base-- or in this case,

00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:46.230
it was Paris-- I
process all that stuff.

00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:49.710
Print out the actual
images, and then read them.

00:38:49.710 --> 00:38:52.930
And then when I'm done with
that, I go back for more.

00:38:52.930 --> 00:38:55.590
And then finally, I end up with
stacks, and stacks, and stacks,

00:38:55.590 --> 00:38:59.460
and stacks of documents,
sort of loosely

00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.170
arranged by-- not typically
by content, but more

00:39:03.170 --> 00:39:06.080
by my research
trip, because that's

00:39:06.080 --> 00:39:08.580
how I'll remember them best.

00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:10.940
And then everything
gets indexed and coded.

00:39:10.940 --> 00:39:13.120
And then finally
I place everything

00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:17.970
into a chronology,
which is essentially

00:39:17.970 --> 00:39:18.990
an index to everything.

00:39:18.990 --> 00:39:20.406
Because half the
battle is knowing

00:39:20.406 --> 00:39:22.610
where your best stuff is.

00:39:22.610 --> 00:39:25.970
I mean, if you have to,
at the end of the process,

00:39:25.970 --> 00:39:30.110
find, like, a one word
fact that is terrific,

00:39:30.110 --> 00:39:32.690
and you have to go through
20,000 pages of material

00:39:32.690 --> 00:39:34.290
to find it, you'll go crazy.

00:39:34.290 --> 00:39:35.224
You know?

00:39:35.224 --> 00:39:37.140
But this chronology is
my index, but it's also

00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.348
something else very valuable.

00:39:38.348 --> 00:39:42.740
For this book it was 165 single
spaced pages on my computer.

00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.539
And in the end, it served
as a de facto outline.

00:39:45.539 --> 00:39:48.080
Because if you think about it,
one of the most powerful tools

00:39:48.080 --> 00:39:50.460
in storytelling-- the most
powerful tool, as far as I'm

00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:53.060
concerned-- is chronology.

00:39:53.060 --> 00:39:54.920
Beginning, middle, and end.

00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:57.660
So it becomes a
de facto outline,

00:39:57.660 --> 00:39:59.810
and where things
clump together, I

00:39:59.810 --> 00:40:03.110
know that that's likely
going to be a chapter.

00:40:03.110 --> 00:40:05.870
And then during-- as
the action accelerates,

00:40:05.870 --> 00:40:08.370
this chronology goes
from-- it might start just

00:40:08.370 --> 00:40:11.520
with things sorted by
year, then by month,

00:40:11.520 --> 00:40:13.750
it goes down to the
day, to the hour,

00:40:13.750 --> 00:40:17.060
to the minute, in some
cases, in this chronology.

00:40:17.060 --> 00:40:20.370
And that's a very powerful tool
for finding things, and also

00:40:20.370 --> 00:40:24.290
knowing where you're going
to go as you write the thing.

00:40:24.290 --> 00:40:27.790
That's a broad survey
of how I do it.

00:40:27.790 --> 00:40:28.574
AUDIENCE: Thanks.

00:40:28.574 --> 00:40:30.157
ERIK LARSON: There's
a lot more to it,

00:40:30.157 --> 00:40:31.532
but I don't want
to bore anybody.

00:40:33.314 --> 00:40:34.730
AUDIENCE: The books
you've written

00:40:34.730 --> 00:40:37.060
have had such
varied storytelling,

00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.140
and I'm wondering if you've
had a subject that you've most

00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:43.445
enjoyed researching, or a story
you've most enjoyed telling.

00:40:43.445 --> 00:40:45.461
And I'm also wondering
what you're reading now,

00:40:45.461 --> 00:40:46.710
and if you would recommend it.

00:40:46.710 --> 00:40:47.720
ERIK LARSON: Oh, OK.

00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:49.261
Well, you know, what
I'm reading now,

00:40:49.261 --> 00:40:53.430
I'm reading-- I'll knock
off the easy one first.

00:40:53.430 --> 00:40:58.820
That is-- first of all,
when I read for pleasure,

00:40:58.820 --> 00:40:59.910
I read fiction.

00:40:59.910 --> 00:41:02.620
Because I read so
much awful, frankly,

00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:06.044
nonfiction in the
course of my day.

00:41:06.044 --> 00:41:07.710
And I'm very grateful
that so much of it

00:41:07.710 --> 00:41:10.960
is awful, because it
leaves a lot of room

00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.780
to write something
that's decent.

00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:14.260
You know?

00:41:14.260 --> 00:41:17.210
But I read mostly fiction.

00:41:17.210 --> 00:41:23.550
I love-- I've been, of
late, on a jag reading

00:41:23.550 --> 00:41:25.845
dark Scandinavian
detective novels.

00:41:25.845 --> 00:41:27.900
I love them.

00:41:27.900 --> 00:41:29.400
You know, Henning
Mankell, Jo Nesbo.

00:41:29.400 --> 00:41:34.720
And I'm rereading "Smilla's
Sense of Snow", by Peter Hoeg,

00:41:34.720 --> 00:41:37.720
I think is how you pronounce it.

00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:42.279
And then your other question
was, has there-- Repeat

00:41:42.279 --> 00:41:43.070
the other question.

00:41:43.070 --> 00:41:44.860
AUDIENCE: I wondered if
there was a subject that you,

00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:47.443
of the books you've written, the
subject that you most enjoyed

00:41:47.443 --> 00:41:48.412
researching or telling.

00:41:48.412 --> 00:41:49.120
ERIK LARSON: Boy.

00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:53.250
You know, it's really hard.

00:41:53.250 --> 00:41:53.940
I love them all.

00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:55.398
They all have
different challenges.

00:41:55.398 --> 00:41:59.106
I mean, in some ways,
this particular book

00:41:59.106 --> 00:42:00.730
was the most satisfying,
again, because

00:42:00.730 --> 00:42:05.550
of this incredible
reservoir of material that I

00:42:05.550 --> 00:42:09.650
was able to tap, it
was just so much fun.

00:42:09.650 --> 00:42:12.880
And offered such a
tremendous opportunity

00:42:12.880 --> 00:42:15.990
to really make this book into
kind of a nonfiction maritime

00:42:15.990 --> 00:42:16.570
thriller.

00:42:16.570 --> 00:42:18.120
I just love that.

00:42:18.120 --> 00:42:21.030
However, there were elements
of some of my other books.

00:42:21.030 --> 00:42:23.312
I mean, I loved the
World's Fair part

00:42:23.312 --> 00:42:24.520
of "Devil in the White City".

00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.260
I mean, it was just
like an endless treat.

00:42:28.260 --> 00:42:32.530
But probably my all-time
favorite, frankly,

00:42:32.530 --> 00:42:35.580
was in my book
"Thunderstruck", about Marconi

00:42:35.580 --> 00:42:38.410
and the intersection
of his career

00:42:38.410 --> 00:42:40.900
with Britain's second
most famous murder,

00:42:40.900 --> 00:42:42.870
Hawley Harvey Crippen.

00:42:42.870 --> 00:42:46.796
Second most famous, of
course, after Jack the Ripper.

00:42:46.796 --> 00:42:48.750
Even though he really
only killed one person,

00:42:48.750 --> 00:42:51.260
Crippen, but their
lives intersected

00:42:51.260 --> 00:42:52.230
in a very funky way.

00:42:52.230 --> 00:42:56.050
But what I loved
most was writing

00:42:56.050 --> 00:43:01.400
the chase that occupies the
last 100 pages of that book.

00:43:01.400 --> 00:43:06.200
Because I got so
lucky in the research.

00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.730
Again, I went back to the
National Archives of the UK.

00:43:09.730 --> 00:43:14.229
And really, literally, on
my last day of research.

00:43:14.229 --> 00:43:16.353
And in that case, I had
not based myself in Europe.

00:43:16.353 --> 00:43:17.920
I was living in Seattle.

00:43:17.920 --> 00:43:19.300
To me, it was a torment.

00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:21.290
11 hours each way by plane.

00:43:21.290 --> 00:43:22.740
It was just a nightmare.

00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:26.450
Xanax helps a lot,
let me tell you.

00:43:26.450 --> 00:43:29.900
But there had been this file
that I was trying to locate.

00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:32.870
And it was like, MePo
'98, or whatever it was.

00:43:32.870 --> 00:43:34.480
Meaning Metropolitan
Police, '98.

00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:36.332
I think it was '98.

00:43:36.332 --> 00:43:37.540
And it was always eluding me.

00:43:37.540 --> 00:43:40.050
It was always, every
time I asked for it,

00:43:40.050 --> 00:43:43.115
it seemed to be out in
somebody else's possession.

00:43:43.115 --> 00:43:44.740
And I thought, oh my
god, somebody else

00:43:44.740 --> 00:43:45.730
is doing this book.

00:43:45.730 --> 00:43:47.190
What is happening here?

00:43:47.190 --> 00:43:48.930
And finally, out
of desperation, I

00:43:48.930 --> 00:43:51.641
went up to the archive
information people,

00:43:51.641 --> 00:43:53.890
and I said, look, I'm trying
to track this thing down.

00:43:53.890 --> 00:43:56.000
Can you tell me where it is?

00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:57.110
Is somebody using it?

00:43:57.110 --> 00:44:00.260
I have to leave tomorrow,
blah, blah, blah, blah.

00:44:00.260 --> 00:44:05.430
And the guy says, oh,
yeah, it's in conservation.

00:44:05.430 --> 00:44:07.340
So, OK.

00:44:07.340 --> 00:44:09.100
So it's in the
part of the archive

00:44:09.100 --> 00:44:12.960
where they work on their
files and conserve them,

00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:16.650
so that they last
longer, and so forth.

00:44:16.650 --> 00:44:18.160
And I said, well, can I see it?

00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:20.300
He said, well, sure.

00:44:20.300 --> 00:44:22.320
And so they let me see it.

00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.880
I go through
successive-- I mean,

00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.320
honestly, it was like some
kind of-- the security

00:44:26.320 --> 00:44:28.763
to get to the conservation
room in the archives of the UK,

00:44:28.763 --> 00:44:30.127
it was incredible.

00:44:30.127 --> 00:44:31.585
It was like going
through airlocks.

00:44:31.585 --> 00:44:32.230
You know?

00:44:32.230 --> 00:44:35.010
Door, door, readers
guard, this, this, this.

00:44:35.010 --> 00:44:36.550
And then, it was
like this moment,

00:44:36.550 --> 00:44:38.880
where I sort of expected
to have some sort

00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:40.880
of operatic crescendo.

00:44:40.880 --> 00:44:45.555
And here, here on this
table, just there.

00:44:45.555 --> 00:44:47.430
As soon as I opened
it, it was like I

00:44:47.430 --> 00:44:49.444
had this-- it was like
an electric charge

00:44:49.444 --> 00:44:50.110
went through me.

00:44:50.110 --> 00:44:51.520
Right on the cover.

00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:57.070
Right on the top of this huge
pile of materials in this file,

00:44:57.070 --> 00:44:58.720
was this photograph.

00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:02.930
Gleaming, classic, old high
silver-content photograph.

00:45:02.930 --> 00:45:06.370
Just terrific photograph
of the detective

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:11.320
and his guys, after they
just dug up Crippen's wife.

00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:14.230
And they just had
this-- there's a term

00:45:14.230 --> 00:45:15.800
I would use to describe it.

00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:17.950
But it's a certain kind
of grin that we all know.

00:45:17.950 --> 00:45:21.360
And I'm not going
to use the term.

00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:24.030
They were just so
smug and happy.

00:45:24.030 --> 00:45:28.000
And then the rest of the
file, detail, after detail,

00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000
after detail, from
within Scotland Yard.

00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.260
About this guy, and the
chase, and the investigation.

00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:36.180
I couldn't believe it.

00:45:36.180 --> 00:45:37.346
And of course, the last day.

00:45:37.346 --> 00:45:41.797
So I just went down
the main office.

00:45:41.797 --> 00:45:43.380
And I said, look,
I've got this thing.

00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:45.546
This is where you arrange
to have things duplicated.

00:45:45.546 --> 00:45:48.280
And I said, I don't care what
it costs, I want the whole file.

00:45:48.280 --> 00:45:48.816
You know?

00:45:48.816 --> 00:45:50.440
It was one of those
liberating moments.

00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:51.770
I knew it was going to
cost me, like $1,000.

00:45:51.770 --> 00:45:52.470
You know?

00:45:52.470 --> 00:45:54.360
But I was going to
get that damn file.

00:45:54.360 --> 00:45:56.360
And then sure enough, two
weeks later, by FedEx,

00:45:56.360 --> 00:45:57.130
I get this whole thing.

00:45:57.130 --> 00:45:58.088
It was like incredible.

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.990
I just love moments like that.

00:45:59.990 --> 00:46:03.320
And so often, frankly, the best
stuff turns up on the last day.

00:46:03.320 --> 00:46:03.882
Yeah.

00:46:03.882 --> 00:46:04.715
AUDIENCE: Thank you.

00:46:04.715 --> 00:46:06.427
ERIK LARSON: Sure.

00:46:06.427 --> 00:46:08.010
AUDIENCE: In many
of your works you'll

00:46:08.010 --> 00:46:10.510
explore larger
than life figures,

00:46:10.510 --> 00:46:11.960
like Wilson and Churchill.

00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.880
And explore nuances
and even weaknesses

00:46:13.880 --> 00:46:15.290
behind these characteristics.

00:46:15.290 --> 00:46:17.910
For this reason, have you
received any negative feedback

00:46:17.910 --> 00:46:19.460
for these explorations?

00:46:19.460 --> 00:46:21.180
Is there anyone
you wouldn't touch?

00:46:21.180 --> 00:46:23.550
Or any events you wouldn't
touch as a consequence?

00:46:23.550 --> 00:46:25.633
ERIK LARSON: No, there's
nothing I wouldn't touch.

00:46:25.633 --> 00:46:26.320
I love conflict.

00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:26.820
[LAUGHTER]

00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:30.090
No, no, I mean, I love nuance.

00:46:30.090 --> 00:46:31.290
I don't believe in heroes.

00:46:31.290 --> 00:46:34.030
When I read anything
that contains

00:46:34.030 --> 00:46:39.504
a saga of an unalloyed
hero, I wonder, OK,

00:46:39.504 --> 00:46:40.670
what are you not telling me?

00:46:40.670 --> 00:46:41.800
Because people are people.

00:46:41.800 --> 00:46:42.300
You know?

00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:45.590
I mean, Churchill,
he was essentially

00:46:45.590 --> 00:46:48.610
fired from the Admiralty during
World War I, for the carnage

00:46:48.610 --> 00:46:50.690
in the Dardanelles.

00:46:50.690 --> 00:46:55.242
And then redeemed himself
again in World War II.

00:46:55.242 --> 00:46:56.700
But nuance, I think,
is everything.

00:46:56.700 --> 00:47:03.340
I mean, Wilson-- during
this period, context, again,

00:47:03.340 --> 00:47:05.040
is everything.

00:47:05.040 --> 00:47:09.169
He was head over heels in love
with his girlfriend-- well, not

00:47:09.169 --> 00:47:09.960
yet his girlfriend.

00:47:09.960 --> 00:47:11.400
She was holding
him at bay, and he

00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.980
was writing these incredible
passionate love letters to her.

00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:20.590
And I came across that, and I
was just like, I don't care.

00:47:20.590 --> 00:47:22.960
These are going in the book,
whether they should or not.

00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:25.990
This is too good.

00:47:25.990 --> 00:47:29.180
And the fact that he was doing
this during the crossing.

00:47:29.180 --> 00:47:32.071
As the ship was crossing, he was
writing these passionate love

00:47:32.071 --> 00:47:32.570
letters.

00:47:32.570 --> 00:47:33.980
I was like, wow.

00:47:33.980 --> 00:47:35.620
It just seemed to fit.

00:47:35.620 --> 00:47:39.177
So, there are those who
are annoyed at Wilson--

00:47:39.177 --> 00:47:41.385
they're not annoyed at me,
they're annoyed at Wilson.

00:47:41.385 --> 00:47:43.670
But the best example, though,
of this kind of thing,

00:47:43.670 --> 00:47:47.220
was when I did a book
called "Isaac's Storm",

00:47:47.220 --> 00:47:50.020
about a giant hurricane that
destroyed the city of Galveston

00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:51.000
in the year 1900.

00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:53.700
About the weatherman who
thought he knew everything

00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:57.020
about the weather, but was
proven drastically, tragically,

00:47:57.020 --> 00:47:58.000
wrong that day.

00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.736
A guy named Isaac Cline.

00:47:59.736 --> 00:48:02.550
Until this point, Isaac
Cline had been a Texas hero.

00:48:02.550 --> 00:48:03.320
You know?

00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:05.660
Like, he might as well
frankly have been,

00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:07.837
you know, at whatever it was.

00:48:07.837 --> 00:48:10.170
San Antonio-- you know, the
thing that the Texans always

00:48:10.170 --> 00:48:11.350
talk about.

00:48:11.350 --> 00:48:11.859
The Alamo.

00:48:11.859 --> 00:48:13.650
He might as well have
been there, you know.

00:48:13.650 --> 00:48:15.900
He might have been there in
the Alamo, for all I know,

00:48:15.900 --> 00:48:19.690
but he should have been,
for how they viewed him.

00:48:19.690 --> 00:48:22.600
But the fact is, he blew it.

00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:24.210
He blew it that day.

00:48:24.210 --> 00:48:27.330
And to tell the story in
any other way, is to lie.

00:48:27.330 --> 00:48:30.100
Well, the Texans
did not like that.

00:48:30.100 --> 00:48:33.760
A certain cadre did not like it,
to the point where at one talk

00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:37.570
I gave, it at a large
bookstore in Bexar County,

00:48:37.570 --> 00:48:41.350
I had to have a
Sheriff's deputy present.

00:48:41.350 --> 00:48:45.120
Whether he was really
necessary, I don't know.

00:48:45.120 --> 00:48:47.015
But anyway, so that's that.

00:48:47.015 --> 00:48:47.560
Yeah.

00:48:47.560 --> 00:48:48.059
Thank you.

00:48:51.160 --> 00:48:53.630
AUDIENCE: I'm wondering if you
have any advice for aspiring

00:48:53.630 --> 00:48:54.180
writers.

00:48:54.180 --> 00:48:56.860
Some time ago I
learned of an incident

00:48:56.860 --> 00:49:00.494
that happened in World War
II, that just really struck me

00:49:00.494 --> 00:49:02.410
as, oh my gosh, this is
just a fabulous story.

00:49:02.410 --> 00:49:03.580
And I went and did a
little bit of research.

00:49:03.580 --> 00:49:05.570
And someone actually has
already written a book

00:49:05.570 --> 00:49:08.640
about it, a very small one.

00:49:08.640 --> 00:49:10.140
But I don't think
a lot of people

00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.730
know about this
particular incident,

00:49:11.730 --> 00:49:14.535
unless they happen
to be around there.

00:49:14.535 --> 00:49:16.530
So, it's something
that is certainly

00:49:16.530 --> 00:49:18.485
in the historical record, but--

00:49:18.485 --> 00:49:19.910
ERIK LARSON: What was the idea?

00:49:19.910 --> 00:49:20.910
AUDIENCE: Uh, the idea--

00:49:20.910 --> 00:49:21.530
[LAUGHTER]

00:49:21.530 --> 00:49:23.030
ERIK LARSON: No,
no, no I'm kidding.

00:49:23.030 --> 00:49:23.370
Don't tell me.

00:49:23.370 --> 00:49:24.953
AUDIENCE: We'll talk
about it offline.

00:49:24.953 --> 00:49:27.610
ERIK LARSON: Don't
tell me, don't tell me.

00:49:27.610 --> 00:49:29.020
So what--

00:49:29.020 --> 00:49:30.760
AUDIENCE: As far as
doing something that

00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:32.650
perhaps has been done before.

00:49:32.650 --> 00:49:35.920
ERIK LARSON: Well, first of all,
never be put off by something

00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:36.920
that's been done before.

00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:45.650
Because you are
approaching it in a way

00:49:45.650 --> 00:49:48.145
that is invariably going to
be fresh, because it's you,

00:49:48.145 --> 00:49:49.180
and not somebody else.

00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:49.680
Right?

00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:51.610
I mean, look at the
number of biographies

00:49:51.610 --> 00:49:53.700
that had been done on Wilson.

00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.800
Look at the number of
biographies that have

00:49:55.800 --> 00:49:57.660
been done on Teddy Roosevelt.

00:49:57.660 --> 00:49:58.180
You know?

00:49:58.180 --> 00:50:00.200
I mean, it's been done.

00:50:00.200 --> 00:50:01.920
But they're doing it
again, because they

00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:05.900
feel that there's some way that
they're adding to the story.

00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.940
That they're making it better.

00:50:08.940 --> 00:50:11.542
Something is happening that
you're bring to the party.

00:50:11.542 --> 00:50:13.625
So you have to have that
confidence to begin with.

00:50:13.625 --> 00:50:15.890
The fact that somebody
already did a small book,

00:50:15.890 --> 00:50:18.320
well, all right, so
that's one of the books

00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:19.660
that you use for your research.

00:50:19.660 --> 00:50:23.200
You know, you put that
in the bibliography.

00:50:23.200 --> 00:50:25.660
Then you go ahead and do
yours, and you find, hopefully,

00:50:25.660 --> 00:50:27.500
more stuff.

00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:29.910
But the most important thing
is to find the stuff first.

00:50:29.910 --> 00:50:31.380
You can't fake it.

00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:33.180
You can't-- no
offense to Google--

00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.750
but you can't just
Google things.

00:50:34.750 --> 00:50:38.615
You've got to go to the
scene of crime, if you will.

00:50:38.615 --> 00:50:41.730
You will find things
that you wouldn't not

00:50:41.730 --> 00:50:43.170
find through targeted search.

00:50:43.170 --> 00:50:44.615
You need to be there.

00:50:44.615 --> 00:50:46.340
You need to touch things.

00:50:46.340 --> 00:50:48.310
You need to find
those secret troves

00:50:48.310 --> 00:50:51.200
of materials and documents.

00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:53.270
Because, you know, what
this other guy got,

00:50:53.270 --> 00:50:56.240
there may be 10 times as much.

00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:57.820
He may simply have not found it.

00:50:57.820 --> 00:51:00.675
He may not have gone to the
archives to look for it.

00:51:00.675 --> 00:51:02.100
He may be hiding things.

00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:03.750
I, mean you never know.

00:51:03.750 --> 00:51:06.060
So that should never
be an obstacle.

00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:08.955
I mean, if I had used--
now that, as I said,

00:51:08.955 --> 00:51:10.830
that bothered me a bit
about the "Lusitania,"

00:51:10.830 --> 00:51:12.859
was the fact that
others had done it.

00:51:12.859 --> 00:51:14.400
But then once I
realized, you know, I

00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.220
could bring something
new to this picnic,

00:51:16.220 --> 00:51:19.040
I felt free to do so.

00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.720
So I wouldn't use that obstacle.

00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:24.757
But, the bottom
line is just do it.

00:51:24.757 --> 00:51:26.715
Writing isn't going to
happen unless you do it.

00:51:30.942 --> 00:51:33.470
AUDIENCE: I have a question
about the reaction in Germany

00:51:33.470 --> 00:51:35.730
after the sinking, and
then the change in the way

00:51:35.730 --> 00:51:37.930
that the U-boats would
engage with ships.

00:51:37.930 --> 00:51:40.260
From restricted, to
unrestricted, and back again.

00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:42.930
Did that fundamentally
alter the course of the war?

00:51:42.930 --> 00:51:44.370
Did that--

00:51:44.370 --> 00:51:45.120
ERIK LARSON: Yeah.

00:51:45.120 --> 00:51:48.990
Yeah, I mean, what
happened in Germany, I

00:51:48.990 --> 00:51:50.800
found to be very
interesting, was

00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.880
that in the German hierarchies,
civilian and military,

00:51:53.880 --> 00:51:55.755
there was actually a
division of opinion.

00:51:55.755 --> 00:51:59.556
The civilian
leadership did not want

00:51:59.556 --> 00:52:01.660
the Navy to continue
submarine warfare

00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.560
against civilian
shipping, for fear

00:52:04.560 --> 00:52:07.320
that America would
come into the war.

00:52:07.320 --> 00:52:12.530
However, the German Naval
commanders eventually

00:52:12.530 --> 00:52:15.120
gained ascendancy
with Kaiser Wilhelm,

00:52:15.120 --> 00:52:19.255
persuading him through this
amazingly detailed plan,

00:52:19.255 --> 00:52:22.930
this sort of methodical
German thinking,

00:52:22.930 --> 00:52:28.370
that if they, instead, went
to completely unrestricted

00:52:28.370 --> 00:52:33.750
warfare, that they could
bring Britain to her knees

00:52:33.750 --> 00:52:36.740
within five months.

00:52:36.740 --> 00:52:39.440
Had to start on
February 1, 1915,

00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:42.940
but they could bring Britain
to her knees in five months,

00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.155
exactly.

00:52:44.155 --> 00:52:45.530
They had the timetable.

00:52:45.530 --> 00:52:47.890
They had the whole
thing worked out.

00:52:47.890 --> 00:52:50.840
And this persuaded Kaiser
Wilhelm to say, yes, OK, good.

00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:53.190
We're going to go totally
unrestricted warfare.

00:52:53.190 --> 00:52:55.100
And this, again, is in 1917.

00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:58.800
And this is, in fact, what
got America into the war.

00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:00.690
The civilian
leadership's worst fears

00:53:00.690 --> 00:53:04.390
were realized when they started
sinking American flag ships.

00:53:04.390 --> 00:53:07.230
Including one that carried
a mother and daughter

00:53:07.230 --> 00:53:10.985
whom Wilson's girlfriend
knew well from Chicago.

00:53:10.985 --> 00:53:14.090
And they were killed in
one of these sinkings.

00:53:14.090 --> 00:53:18.745
So that was a material
change in German strategy,

00:53:18.745 --> 00:53:22.362
and it's the thing that
really cost them the war.

00:53:22.362 --> 00:53:24.070
What was the other
part of your question?

00:53:24.070 --> 00:53:25.220
AUDIENCE: No, that was it.

00:53:25.220 --> 00:53:25.520
ERIK LARSON: That was it.

00:53:25.520 --> 00:53:26.172
OK, good.

00:53:26.172 --> 00:53:28.130
SPEAKER: One last one,
Erik, if you don't mind.

00:53:28.130 --> 00:53:28.550
ERIK LARSON: Yes.

00:53:28.550 --> 00:53:30.758
SPEAKER: Over the course of
your career as an author,

00:53:30.758 --> 00:53:32.690
or over the course
of writing this book,

00:53:32.690 --> 00:53:34.850
how have you changed?

00:53:34.850 --> 00:53:37.940
ERIK LARSON: I haven't
been asked that question.

00:53:37.940 --> 00:53:39.250
I think I'm a happier person.

00:53:39.250 --> 00:53:39.750
[LAUGHTER]

00:53:39.750 --> 00:53:40.690
SPEAKER: Really?

00:53:40.690 --> 00:53:42.930
ERIK LARSON: No,
how have I changed?

00:53:42.930 --> 00:53:47.550
I'm much more confident
about the whole process,

00:53:47.550 --> 00:53:51.090
and about certain instinctive
things that now come to me more

00:53:51.090 --> 00:53:53.550
naturally than did.

00:53:53.550 --> 00:54:01.130
For example, knowing when
I have enough research.

00:54:01.130 --> 00:54:05.150
Knowing when the time has
come to start writing.

00:54:05.150 --> 00:54:07.070
I've got a good instinctive
sense of that now.

00:54:07.070 --> 00:54:11.105
And also knowing when an idea,
once I have settled on an idea,

00:54:11.105 --> 00:54:14.680
knowing when it's going to work.

00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:16.200
What it what it needs.

00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:18.490
What elements have to be there.

00:54:18.490 --> 00:54:22.580
And before, I tried to
talk myself out of it.

00:54:22.580 --> 00:54:24.400
But now I know.

00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:27.320
I have a real sense of that.

00:54:27.320 --> 00:54:29.175
And also, what else
has changed, is

00:54:29.175 --> 00:54:31.260
that it has helped me put
my kids through college,

00:54:31.260 --> 00:54:33.135
and I don't have to
worry about that anymore.

00:54:33.135 --> 00:54:33.719
[LAUGHTER]

00:54:33.719 --> 00:54:35.510
SPEAKER: Well, Erik,
I think we're at time.

00:54:35.510 --> 00:54:36.520
Thanks so much for being here.

00:54:36.520 --> 00:54:37.230
That was wonderful.

00:54:37.230 --> 00:54:37.470
ERIK LARSON: Pleasure.

00:54:37.470 --> 00:54:37.770
SPEAKER: Thank you.

00:54:37.770 --> 00:54:38.728
ERIK LARSON: Thank you.

00:54:38.728 --> 00:54:39.870
[APPLAUSE]

00:54:39.870 --> 00:54:42.620
