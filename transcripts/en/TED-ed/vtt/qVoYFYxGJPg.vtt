00:00:07.213 --> 00:00:09.972
Dating back at least 
to the time of Socrates,

00:00:09.972 --> 00:00:13.263
some early societies decided
that certain disputes,

00:00:13.263 --> 00:00:16.173
such as whether a person committed
a particular crime,

00:00:16.173 --> 00:00:18.832
should be heard by a group of citizens.

00:00:18.832 --> 00:00:23.053
Several centuries later, trial by jury
was introduced to England,

00:00:23.053 --> 00:00:26.842
where it became a fundamental feature
of the legal system,

00:00:26.842 --> 00:00:30.954
checking the government 
and involving citizens in decision-making.

00:00:30.954 --> 00:00:34.164
Juries decided whether defendants
would be tried on crimes,

00:00:34.164 --> 00:00:37.462
determined whether the accused
defendants were guilty,

00:00:37.462 --> 00:00:40.453
and resolved monetary disputes.

00:00:40.453 --> 00:00:44.123
While the American colonies eventually
cast off England's rule,

00:00:44.123 --> 00:00:46.834
its legal tradition of the jury persisted.

00:00:46.834 --> 00:00:49.844
The United States Constitution 
instructed a grand jury

00:00:49.844 --> 00:00:52.594
to decide whether 
criminal cases proceeded,

00:00:52.594 --> 00:00:56.134
required a jury to try all crimes,
except impeachment,

00:00:56.134 --> 00:00:59.282
and provided for juries 
in civil cases as well.

00:00:59.282 --> 00:01:03.004
Yet, in the US today,
grand juries often are not convened,

00:01:03.004 --> 00:01:06.864
and juries decide less than 4%
of criminal cases

00:01:06.864 --> 00:01:10.354
and less than 1% of civil cases
filed in court.

00:01:10.354 --> 00:01:14.424
That's at the same time as jury systems
in other countries are growing.

00:01:14.424 --> 00:01:16.885
So what happened in the U.S.?

00:01:16.885 --> 00:01:21.895
Part of the story lies in how the Supreme
Court has interpreted the Constitution.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:23.657
It's permitted plea bargaining,

00:01:23.657 --> 00:01:26.520
which now occurs in almost 
every criminal case.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.817
The way it works is the prosecutor
presents the accused

00:01:29.817 --> 00:01:32.236
with a decision of whether 
to plead guilty.

00:01:32.236 --> 00:01:35.582
If they accept the plea, the case won't
go in front of a jury,

00:01:35.582 --> 00:01:37.751
but they'll receive 
a shorter prison sentence

00:01:37.751 --> 00:01:40.841
than they'd get if 
a jury did convict them.

00:01:40.841 --> 00:01:43.671
The risk of a much greater 
prison sentence after a trial

00:01:43.671 --> 00:01:47.511
can frighten even an innocent defendant
into taking a plea.

00:01:47.511 --> 00:01:49.992
Between the 19th century 
and the 21st century,

00:01:49.992 --> 00:01:55.522
the proportion of guilty pleas
has increased from around 20% to 90%,

00:01:55.522 --> 00:01:57.617
and the numbers continue to grow.

00:01:57.617 --> 00:02:00.503
The Supreme Court has permitted
the use of another procedure

00:02:00.503 --> 00:02:02.313
that interferes with the jury

00:02:02.313 --> 00:02:04.044
called summary judgement.

00:02:04.044 --> 00:02:08.143
Using summary judgement, judges can
decide that civil trials are unnecessary

00:02:08.143 --> 00:02:11.962
if the people who sue 
have insufficient evidence.

00:02:11.962 --> 00:02:17.002
This is intended only for cases
where no reasonable jury would disagree.

00:02:17.002 --> 00:02:19.102
That's a difficult thing 
to determine,

00:02:19.102 --> 00:02:21.982
yet usage of summary judgement
has stretched to the point

00:02:21.982 --> 00:02:25.012
where some would argue it's being abused.

00:02:25.012 --> 00:02:27.723
For instance, judges grant fully,
or in part,

00:02:27.723 --> 00:02:30.367
over 70% of employers' requests

00:02:30.367 --> 00:02:33.712
to dismiss employment 
discrimination cases.

00:02:33.712 --> 00:02:38.114
In other cases, both the person who sues
and the person who defends

00:02:38.114 --> 00:02:40.683
forgo their right to go to court,

00:02:40.683 --> 00:02:44.544
instead resolving their dispute through
a professional arbitrator.

00:02:44.544 --> 00:02:48.173
These are generally lawyers, professors,
or former judges.

00:02:48.173 --> 00:02:51.044
Arbitration can be a smart decision
by both parties

00:02:51.044 --> 00:02:53.984
to avoid the requirements 
of a trial in court,

00:02:53.984 --> 00:02:57.194
but it's often agreed to unwittingly
when people sign contracts

00:02:57.194 --> 00:03:01.105
like employment applications
and consumer agreements.

00:03:01.105 --> 00:03:02.575
That can become a problem.

00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:05.144
For example, some arbitrators 
may be biased

00:03:05.144 --> 00:03:07.555
towards the companies
that give them cases.

00:03:07.555 --> 00:03:10.725
These are just some of the ways
in which juries have disappeared.

00:03:10.725 --> 00:03:13.765
But could the disappearance of juries
be a good thing?

00:03:13.765 --> 00:03:15.685
Well, juries aren't perfect.

00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:16.775
They're costly,

00:03:16.775 --> 00:03:17.765
time-consuming,

00:03:17.765 --> 00:03:19.275
and may make errors.

00:03:19.275 --> 00:03:21.255
And they're not always necessary,

00:03:21.255 --> 00:03:24.684
like when people can simply agree
to settle their disputes.

00:03:24.684 --> 00:03:26.765
But juries have their advantages.

00:03:26.765 --> 00:03:28.135
When properly selected,

00:03:28.135 --> 00:03:31.516
jurors are more representative of
the general population

00:03:31.516 --> 00:03:34.366
and don't have the same incentives
as prosecutors,

00:03:34.366 --> 00:03:35.256
legislators,

00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:36.256
or judges

00:03:36.256 --> 00:03:38.315
seeking reelection or promotion.

00:03:38.315 --> 00:03:40.966
The founders of the United States trusted
in the wisdom

00:03:40.966 --> 00:03:42.845
of impartial groups of citizens

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:45.805
to check the power of all three branches
of government.

00:03:45.805 --> 00:03:49.246
And the jury trial itself has given
ordinary citizens

00:03:49.246 --> 00:03:52.145
a central role in upholding
the social fabric.

00:03:52.145 --> 00:03:56.356
So will the jury system in the U.S.
survive into the future?
