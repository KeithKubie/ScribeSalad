Speaker 1:          00:00          You are listening to radio lab radio lab from [inaudible], W.N.Y.S.T.E n NPR Three two one. Hey, I'm Jad Abumrad. I remember quill week. This is radio lab podcast and today on the podcast, um, well first we've got a story from our, uh, old producer of Lula Miller. She's not old. She's just has been with us and now is it in school right? Is that she's actually kind of young chronologically. She's not old. She's old to us. Yeah, it's an old soul. Uh, any case, this is a story about some of the sticky issues that result when you try and empathize with another being. Yeah, it's a very different story than one we've ever told a, it started for Lulu when she spoke with them. We'll, she'll handle the introductions. Can you introduce yourself? A award winning author, fantastic husband. Any nine out of the year or the year? No, I'm Jeff Lockwood. I'm a professor at the University of Wyoming is an entomologist. You mean like a bug guy? The bug guy. And mostly he studies crickets and grasshoppers. And this story involves a kind of crickets. That's well different, the gorillas. Yeah. The grill accrediteds yeah. And are they related to Katy? Did you think of a griller? Credit is like a cricket

Speaker 1:          01:22          on steroids. Okay. Sort of like the whole Cogan of crickets. First of all, he says they're a little bulkier than your average cricket. And they tend to have very strong jaws, very strong jaws and mandibles that are really sharp, sort of like a serrated knife. And most of all, they're vicious. They all had to be caged separately. If you put them together, they would, they would fight to the death. Yeah. Wow. And so when I would go in in the mornings and reach into one of their cages, as soon as they saw him coming, they'd fly into this rage.

Speaker 2:          01:59          It's really sort of a show stopper. They'll sort of rear up on their hind leg, feet, their abdomens on the ground, layer out their wings, and then

Speaker 1:          02:10          clamp onto his fingers. They would draw blood. Whoa. Wow. So I use this, uh, this glass probe on, on, on the big boy, uh, at least until the point at which he snapped off the end of the glass rod. Holy Moly. So I ended up with, with the, actually there are two that were very large. Um, I would just take their cage when I, when I went in and pop it in the refrigerator and go get a cup of coffee and within 15 minutes, because in sex or cold blooded, they would be anesthetized by the cold and I could lift them out. That's cheating. That was my solution for them. The little guys I could manage, the big ones, I'm a little bit of chill in the morning is all it took to the point is these creatures were completely alien to him. There's like nothing about them he can relate to, but over time, the more he studied them,

Speaker 3:          03:00          the more he started noticing things that made them seem way less foreign. See, I kept these in these, for example, as soon as he'd put one into a new cage, it would make itself a little nest. And once it has that little nest built that's home in a very real way because by moving them around to different cages, he soon realized that they could differentiate their, their nests. They can actually tell the difference between their nest and another. And how do they do that? They secrete a pheromone chemical and each cricket is able to self identify its own odor. Whoa. It gave me the sense, and I think there's something to this that they had a kind of capacity to recognize self. Oh interesting. We don't see that much in insects, but they had a what appears to be a capacity to say this is mine.

Speaker 1:          03:52          And then he began to think differently about that crazy rage too. Cause if, if you think about it, here's this creature, it's completely vulnerable to attack. They really don't have a very good defense for themselves. They don't excrete nasty chemicals, they don't stain, they can't fly. So it's not going to go flying away either. So maybe that rage is their only strategy, which again drew me into thinking that I understood them. Perhaps these little guys were more like me than than many other insects that I had worked with. So he grew to really like them. But then one day I'd been working with this particular griller, accredited China, move him from one cage to another, and he was agitated and had decided to go on the offensive, which involved trying to come out of the cage. So he was scrambling up the side of the cage and to keep him from getting out, Jeff slammed the lid down as he was just at the edge and caught him between the lid and the edge of the cage.

Speaker 4:          04:50          And I, you know, quickly lifted the lid up and he fell back into the cage and I looked down at him and, uh, what had happened was I had ruptured his abdomen,

Speaker 1:          05:03          a split right down his belly shapes and [inaudible]

Speaker 4:          05:07          some of the, um, the Viscera, um, and, and kind of Glob you have of yellow fat was leaking out.

Speaker 5:          05:15          Yeah.

Speaker 4:          05:16          Who was he and out of his body? I, I felt guilt. And then of course, I felt sorry for an animal, but what really struck me was what he did next, which was curl his head downward, uh, toward his abdomen, pause for a moment, and then began consuming his own innards, consuming the viscera that, that had, that was oozing out of his body. Um, and so he was, he was literally cannibalizing himself.

Speaker 1:          05:50          Wow. That is disgusting. It was horrifying. Mine.

Speaker 4:          05:56          Um, I had sort of like, I'd come to, I had

Speaker 1:          05:58          come to know them. Yeah. And then this, this was just so out of the imaginable, but the instant, that word popped into his mind. Unimaginable. He had this sort of Pavlovian reflex and he thought of this guy, an old professor of his, Dr Lefarge lefarge. He was one of my mentors at Louisiana State University. You said this is a teacher of his, Yep. Insect behavior. He was one of the younger faculty members when I was there, mid thirties, slight of build, but incredibly intense. He's kind of an expert in animal violence. And the thing he harped on over and over, the thing he was trying to pound into their brains was objectivity. Two separate ones, the emotions and interests from the object of study and uh, yeah, these wire rim glasses. And I, and I remember if, uh, if, uh, if you would ask you a question like why does the gorilla created, do it's crazy war dance and you tried sort of reading in will intention mental states maybe cause it's angry or scared, you would just drop his Chin and look over the top and tear you apart.

Speaker 1:          07:07          His job in the classroom was to make us good objective observers and Jeff, Jeff stayed in touch with him over the years. I wanted to be good at this as he set up his own lab. You know, I had a stake in, in, in earning his respect. And so that day as he's watching the gorilla created consume its own guts thinking, okay, what would lefarge see in this? So Mike, my sense in my research is that what this gorilla credit had done was perhaps to have detected the odor of its own fats. It sort of drew the conclusion that this must be something good to eat without sort of grasping that it was, it's its own self, the smell of its own fat triggered a feeding behavior that that's highly adaptive. Um, you know, to feed on fat fats are very hard to get hold of out in the world.

Speaker 1:          07:55          And so when you smell fats, it's, you know, it's, you know, it's like us and donuts, right? Um, yeah. Go for it. Triggers feeding. Yeah. It triggers feeding. So clearly these things don't quite have a sense of self. Right. So, so maybe they're not just like me, which is always lefarge is point. Don't put the creature in your box. It doesn't want to be there. It's sort of a moral danger almost to sort of not allow the organism to be what it is. It's almost a sort of possess it or to own it and to really treat the insects sort of with a, with a, with, with a deep respect, right. Is oddly enough to treat them objectively.

Speaker 5:          08:35          [inaudible],

Speaker 1:          08:36          you know, he, he was one of the, one of the professors who actually engendered a kind of a good fear

Speaker 5:          08:44          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          08:44          and he was the kind of person who you, um, who you wanted to please

Speaker 5:          08:53          [inaudible].

Speaker 1:          08:53          Is that better? A little louder. Yeah, a tiny bit. Is that okay? Oh, that's great. Great, great. But then years later, something happened that challenged Jeff's ability to do this, to be the kind of scientist that lefarge wanted him to be. We're recording over here and there's really only one person who can tell us this part of the story. Will you, um, introduce yourself? Okay. My name is Tamara Carboni. Tamra is actually not a scientist. She worked for the Louisiana State Museum and back in 1989, she and Dr Lafarge, whose first name is also Jeff, we're working together on this termite problem. The termites were getting really bad in the French quarter and it was her job to preserve the historic homes. And Jeff was studying the termites. I never imagined that I would be fascinated by termites, but I was so, he made it fascinating. Yeah. Fascinating. But then one night in July, July 25th, they met for dinner to talk about how the project was going. And, um,

Speaker 3:          09:55          we were walking home, well, he was walking me to my house around 10, 10 30 at night and I think it must have been raining or there was a threat of rain because Jeff was carrying an umbrella and I could hear footsteps behind us, very determined sounding footsteps. And, um, we got to a corner across from my house. And at that point, this person came around us in front of us and he said, close your eyes. And in the process of closing my eyes, I saw the gun.

Speaker 5:          10:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          10:39          so she closed her eyes in a second later, she felt a tug on her purse. I could feel him take hold of the straps and I was not going to resist. And as I felt him do that, I could hear Jeff say, don't do that. At that instant, I don't remember the shot at all. You know, I, I felt Jeff move and I guess at that point I opened my eyes. This guy had already run, never took my purse. I saw Jeff running toward my house and I just ran after him. I had no idea he was shot, but he got onto the porch and he collapsed on his back. And at that point he was gushing blood

Speaker 5:          11:39          [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          11:39          and I was trying to get Jeff to understand that help was coming and I kept saying, um, you're going to be okay. They're on their way. And did he say anything? He couldn't talk. He just, he had this kind of stare and I just watched him die.

Speaker 5:          12:00          Mm.

Speaker 3:          12:03          The news came, I a phone call and it just seemed, you know, it was just kind of one of those, those classic, unreal moments. Something about this, you know, must be wrong. It wasn't Dr Loofah or she wasn't really killed. It seemed particularly hard to grasp. On one minute I'm with this vital person and the next minute he's dead. Sadness, anguish, confusion, hysterical, crying. I was in shock. They never found his killer. Never found out anything about him, who he was, why he would do this, just this seemingly senseless act. And that's how Jeff understood it for years, that it was senseless. But over time, something odd started to happen. The fudge started appearing in his brain telling him that that word wasn't good enough and he began to ask himself again, how would Dr Lefarge want me to think about this? How would he think about his own death?

Speaker 1:          13:08          Okay, so I wonder if, if you do have the essay with you. Um, so he writes an essay, we read the last four paragraphs of, of the essay will one, two, three, four. The year after I left Louisiana and came to Wyoming as a freshly minted phd. The first thing he does is he takes lefarge his attitude on violence. Violence is the baseline strategy for most encounters between, and indeed within species. It's not some evil outlying thing, but instead a baseline strategy for all animals. And in that light, he looks at the actions of that night sort of dispassionately. For most humans. First he figures this kid was probably mugging them because he was poor, hopeless, poor, angry in her scared. The woman became tangled in the strap doctor, the fudge having his own instinctual reaction stepped between them. So don't hurt her. You can have the purse.

Speaker 1:          14:05          I can picture him doing this, but perhaps that action itself scared the kid. The young man drew a gun and fired point blank. I showed the essay to Tamra. Yeah, well, no, that's not, I mean, I don't think, and I don't know if he stepped forward or not. You know, again, my eyes were closed. I could feel some kind of movement. I certainly don't think he stepped between eight. There wasn't much space to step between us. For Tamra has been over the event a million times in her head and doesn't add up so easily. First of all, when Dr Lefarge spoke to the kid, it wasn't exactly a command. It was more like tunc to that and he was like, don't be an idiot. Don't do that. It wasn't really threatening. It was more like, look, logically, let's not do this. And while she gets that, the kid might've been scared and not been intending to shoot.

Speaker 1:          14:55          If he never ever could imagine himself shooting somebody, he wouldn't have had a loaded gun. I can't relate to this person. I can't imagine doing violence to another human being or killing them. Um, I can't relate to that at all. And over the years, her friends and family coworkers tried all different kinds of ways to help her make sense of it. Nothing really helped. But there was someone that I worked with, my boss actually, who had been in Vietnam and he took me aside and he said, you know, you'll never understand this. You're not going to understand it. Yeah. Like don't even try. I don't think there's any sense to be made out of it. If we just stopped there, then it's to say that, that it's somehow um, unnatural or inhuman and in fact in a weird kind of way, it's profoundly human. There's no way I can understand it. Yeah. In the end, the essay itself kind of falls short and Jeff admits that it just isn't sufficient. But he says there is a way of understanding this event. He just hasn't gotten there yet. But it is out there. Yeah. It has to be. And Dr Lefarge would have, I think said this as well.

Speaker 5:          16:28          [inaudible]

Speaker 1:          16:28          but for the moment, yeah.

Speaker 4:          16:29          I think I can say that I, I understand, uh, another beans eating its own leaking and trials, um, at a, at a level that I can't understand. One of my fellow beans, um, you know, pulling the trigger and, uh, [inaudible] him killing the man that I love. Yeah.

Speaker 5:          17:04          [inaudible] [inaudible] I am [inaudible] [inaudible]

Speaker 3:          17:16          thanks to Lulu Miller and to Jeff Lockwood, his original essay first appeared in Orion magazine. It's called the nature of violence. Definitely worth the read. Yes. See, I am of the school that says that you can't really make sense of violence like that. This is just a hint of the danger of living in, in a profoundly disordered world, which looks, I think I'm moved to school though, that you have to try to make sense, even if there's no sense to be made. Yeah.
