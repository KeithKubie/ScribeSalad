00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.997
- [Voiceover] Dividing by 10,
a lot like multiplying by 10,

00:00:03.997 --> 00:00:06.159
creates a pattern with numbers.

00:00:06.159 --> 00:00:08.312
So let's dig in and look at dividing by 10

00:00:08.312 --> 00:00:10.363
and look at happens when we divide by 10

00:00:10.363 --> 00:00:12.389
and see if we can figure out that pattern

00:00:12.389 --> 00:00:14.318
and maybe even how it relates

00:00:14.318 --> 00:00:16.623
to the pattern for multiplying by 10.

00:00:16.623 --> 00:00:20.426
Let's take a fairly simple one to start.

00:00:20.426 --> 00:00:23.926
Let's say something like 30 divided by 10.

00:00:26.121 --> 00:00:30.103
One way to think about this
is we're taking the number 30

00:00:30.103 --> 00:00:33.064
and we're dividing it into groups of 10.

00:00:33.064 --> 00:00:37.231
So let's see how many groups
of 10 it takes to make 30.

00:00:38.869 --> 00:00:42.187
One group of 10 is 10,
so that's not enough,

00:00:42.187 --> 00:00:46.354
plus a second group is 20,
plus a third group is 30.

00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.069
So 30 can be thought of
as 10 plus 10 plus 10,

00:00:51.069 --> 00:00:52.902
or three groups of 10.

00:00:54.607 --> 00:00:58.774
So if we divide 30 by 10,
divide 30 into groups of 10,

00:00:59.937 --> 00:01:02.270
we end up with three groups.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.844
Let's try another one, maybe
something slightly trickier,

00:01:09.844 --> 00:01:13.011
maybe let's go with 110 divided by 10.

00:01:18.841 --> 00:01:22.265
And again, we're
dividing, we're taking 110

00:01:22.265 --> 00:01:24.919
and dividing it into groups of 10.

00:01:24.919 --> 00:01:28.801
So let's see how many groups
of 10 it takes to get to 110.

00:01:28.801 --> 00:01:31.583
Here's one 10, plus another is 20,

00:01:31.583 --> 00:01:32.500
30, 40, 50,

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:40.005
another 10 gets us to 60, 70, 80,

00:01:42.885 --> 00:01:46.135
we're getting closer, 90, 100, and 110.

00:01:48.843 --> 00:01:53.238
So this right here is
how many groups of 10

00:01:53.238 --> 00:01:55.405
it takes us to get to 110.

00:01:56.431 --> 00:01:59.040
So let's see how many groups is that.

00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:03.207
One, two, three, four, five,
six, seven, eight, nine, 10,

00:02:04.672 --> 00:02:06.589
11, our solution is 11.

00:02:09.389 --> 00:02:13.384
If we have 110 and we
divide it into groups of 10,

00:02:13.384 --> 00:02:15.467
we end up with 11 groups.

00:02:17.316 --> 00:02:19.653
Let's look at these first two,

00:02:19.653 --> 00:02:22.543
let's pause here and
see if we see a pattern.

00:02:22.543 --> 00:02:26.710
30 divide by 10 was three,
110 divided by 10 was 11,

00:02:28.368 --> 00:02:31.451
so what happened to the 30 in the 110

00:02:32.488 --> 00:02:35.008
to get these quotients?

00:02:35.008 --> 00:02:37.508
And what happened is the zero,

00:02:38.617 --> 00:02:41.199
the zero on the end was taken off.

00:02:41.199 --> 00:02:43.159
Our solution is the same,

00:02:43.159 --> 00:02:45.958
but with the zero taken off the end.

00:02:45.958 --> 00:02:48.584
Here again, the solution is the same

00:02:48.584 --> 00:02:50.930
with a zero taken off the end.

00:02:50.930 --> 00:02:54.929
And if we remember for
multiplication, it was the opposite.

00:02:54.929 --> 00:02:59.059
If we had two times 10
instead of dividing,

00:02:59.059 --> 00:03:01.559
times 10, our solution was 20,

00:03:03.698 --> 00:03:07.865
or two, our original number,
with a zero added to the end.

00:03:11.134 --> 00:03:15.301
Remember, in another one,
something like 13 times 10,

00:03:16.361 --> 00:03:19.546
our product, our solution is a 13,

00:03:19.546 --> 00:03:23.667
the original number, with
a zero added to the end.

00:03:23.667 --> 00:03:27.779
So in multiplication,
when we multiply by 10,

00:03:27.779 --> 00:03:31.335
we add a zero to our
whole number at the end,

00:03:31.335 --> 00:03:34.634
and when we divide, we
do the opposite by 10,

00:03:34.634 --> 00:03:38.801
we take off a zero from the
end of our whole number.

00:03:39.987 --> 00:03:42.712
So knowing that pattern,
let's try one more,

00:03:42.712 --> 00:03:45.716
maybe one where we don't
work out all the 10s,

00:03:45.716 --> 00:03:48.988
but just try to use the
pattern to solve it.

00:03:48.988 --> 00:03:51.062
If we had somethig like, say,

00:03:51.062 --> 00:03:52.729
7,000 divided by 10,

00:03:55.868 --> 00:03:59.118
well, our solution is going to be 7,000

00:04:00.008 --> 00:04:03.557
but with a zero taken off of the end

00:04:03.557 --> 00:04:05.707
because we're dividing by 10,

00:04:05.707 --> 00:04:08.874
so instead of 7,000 we would have 700.

00:04:11.135 --> 00:04:16.060
7,000 divided into groups of
10 would be 700 groups of 10,

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.977
so our solution is 700.

00:04:18.883 --> 00:04:21.924
Let's take this all a step
further and let's think

00:04:21.924 --> 00:04:25.399
about what dividing by 10
is doing to these numbers,

00:04:25.399 --> 00:04:30.354
to 30, to 110, to 7,000, in
terms of their place value.

00:04:30.354 --> 00:04:32.808
So here's a place value chart.

00:04:32.808 --> 00:04:35.223
Let's use it to look at one of the numbers

00:04:35.223 --> 00:04:38.223
we already tried, something like 30.

00:04:39.519 --> 00:04:41.936
And when we divided 30 by 10,

00:04:43.592 --> 00:04:46.088
remember what happened to the three,

00:04:46.088 --> 00:04:50.255
instead of being three 10s,
our solution was three ones.

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:55.247
The three moved one
place value to the right,

00:04:55.247 --> 00:04:59.245
and the zero really did too,
it would move after a decimal,

00:04:59.245 --> 00:05:03.162
which would be 3.0, which
is the same as three,

00:05:04.498 --> 00:05:06.873
which is the reason we didn't
need to write that zero,

00:05:06.873 --> 00:05:09.527
the reason that we could cross it off.

00:05:09.527 --> 00:05:12.067
So our number, instead of being three 10s,

00:05:12.067 --> 00:05:15.288
when we divided by 10, became three ones.

00:05:15.288 --> 00:05:17.782
Let's look at a little
bit trickier of one.

00:05:17.782 --> 00:05:22.143
We also tried 7,000, so that
would be seven thousands,

00:05:22.143 --> 00:05:25.149
zero hundreds, zero 10s, and zero ones,

00:05:25.149 --> 00:05:27.316
and when we divided by 10,

00:05:28.829 --> 00:05:32.978
our seven in our thousands
place became seven hundreds,

00:05:32.978 --> 00:05:36.518
and the zero hundreds became zero 10s,

00:05:36.518 --> 00:05:39.452
and zero 10s became zero ones.

00:05:39.452 --> 00:05:43.098
And that last zero we
were able to cross off

00:05:43.098 --> 00:05:45.444
and move to after the decimal.

00:05:45.444 --> 00:05:48.027
So 7,000 divided by 10 was 700.

00:05:50.112 --> 00:05:54.813
Again, everything moved one
place value to the right.

00:05:54.813 --> 00:05:58.460
So there's two ways to
think about dividing by 10.

00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:01.827
We could either say you
drop a zero off the end,

00:06:01.827 --> 00:06:03.950
or we could say that you move

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:07.367
every digit one place value to the right.

00:06:08.755 --> 00:06:11.094
Let's think about it again
in terms of place value

00:06:11.094 --> 00:06:15.094
with a new number, let's
try something like 630.

00:06:20.691 --> 00:06:24.858
If we divide 630 by 10, we're
going to move everything

00:06:26.801 --> 00:06:29.716
one place value to the
right, so the six hundreds

00:06:29.716 --> 00:06:33.883
will become six 10s, three
10s will become three ones,

00:06:35.832 --> 00:06:39.567
and the zero ones will
move after the decimal.

00:06:39.567 --> 00:06:42.567
So we can say that 630 divided by 10

00:06:46.088 --> 00:06:49.588
is equal to 63, or six 10s and three ones.

00:06:53.393 --> 00:06:58.283
So again, two ways to
think about dividing by 10.

00:06:58.283 --> 00:07:02.450
Either we can cross off a
zero, or we move every digit,

00:07:04.583 --> 00:07:07.916
each digit one place value to the right.
